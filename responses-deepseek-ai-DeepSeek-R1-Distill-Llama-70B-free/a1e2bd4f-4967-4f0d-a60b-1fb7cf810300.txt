Okay, so I've got this question here about present value. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is asking: What is the present value of $10 received in two years' time if the discount rate is 9%? The options are from A to J.

Alright, I remember that present value calculations are about determining what future amounts are worth today, considering the time value of money. The formula I think I need is the present value formula for a single sum. Oh right, it's PV = FV / (1 + r)^n. Where FV is the future value, r is the discount rate, and n is the number of periods.

Let me plug in the numbers. The future value FV is $10, the rate r is 9% which is 0.09, and the time n is two years. So substituting these values into the formula, it should be PV = 10 / (1 + 0.09)^2.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing up the formula. Oh yeah, because we're discounting the future amount back to the present. So the denominator becomes (1.09) squared. Let me calculate that denominator first. 1.09 squared is 1.09 multiplied by 1.09. Let me compute that: 1 times 1 is 1, 1 times 0.09 is 0.09, 0.09 times 1 is another 0.09, and 0.09 times 0.09 is 0.0081. Adding those up: 1 + 0.09 + 0.09 + 0.0081. Wait, no, that's not the way to multiply. Oh wait, 1.09 * 1.09 can be calculated as (1 + 0.09)^2. Using the formula (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b². So that's 1^2 + 2*(1)*(0.09) + (0.09)^2 = 1 + 0.18 + 0.0081 = 1.1881.

So the denominator is 1.1881. Therefore, PV is 10 divided by 1.1881. Let me compute that. 10 / 1.1881. Hmm, let's see. Well, 1.1881 times 8 is about 9.5048. Because 1.1881 * 8 = 9.5048. So 10 is a bit more than that. So 10 minus 9.5048 is 0.4952. So 0.4952 divided by 1.1881 is approximately 0.416. So adding that to 8 gives 8.416. Wait, so 8.416 is approximately the present value. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I should do exact division.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator approach. Let's compute 10 / 1.1881. Let me try it step by step.

1.1881 goes into 10 how many times? Well, 1.1881 times 8 is 9.5048, as before. Subtracting that from 10 gives 0.4952. Bring down a zero, making it 4.952. Now, 1.1881 goes into 4.952 about 4 times because 1.1881 *4 is 4.7524. Subtracting 4.7524 from 4.952 leaves 0.1996. Bring down another zero, making it 1.996. 1.1881 goes into 1.996 approximately 1 time. 1.1881 *1=1.1881. Subtracting gives 0.8079. Bring down another zero: 8.079. 1.1881 goes into that about 6 times because 1.1881 *6=7.1286. Subtracting: 8.079 -7.1286 is 0.9504. Bring down another zero: 9.504. Now, 1.1881 *8=9.5048, which is just a bit over 9.504. So it's about 8. So putting it all together, the division gives approximately 8.426... So around 8.43.

Wait, but my options are: A:10.42, B:8.42, C:8.26, D:11, E:7.92, F:8.70, G:9, H:7.85, I:10.09, J:9.50.

So 8.42 is option B, but wait, my calculation gave me approximately 8.42, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using another method.

Alternatively, maybe using the present value factors. The present value interest factor for 9% over two years is 1/(1.09)^2, which is 1/1.1881 as I had before, so approximately 0.8417. Then, 10 multiplied by 0.8417 gives about 8.417, so 8.42, which is option B.

Wait, but another thought. Oh wait, is the discount rate 9% annually, compounded annually? Yes, that's the standard assumption unless stated otherwise. So that part is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. Let me compute 1.09 squared. 1.09 * 1.09: 1*1 is 1, 1*0.09 is 0.09, 0.09*1 is 0.09, 0.09*0.09 is 0.0081. Adding: 1 + 0.09 + 0.09 + 0.0081 = 1.1881. So that's correct.

So 10 / 1.1881 = approximately 8.417, which rounds to 8.42, so option B.

But wait, looking at the options, option F is 8.70, which is higher. Did I make a mistake? Because 8.42 is lower than 8.70, so maybe I made a calculation error.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using simple interest instead of compound interest. Wait, no, in finance, when you're calculating present value for multiple periods, you typically use compound interest unless stated otherwise. So the correct formula is definitely the one with (1 + r)^n.

Wait, let me compute 1.09 squared again. 1.09 * 1.09. Let me compute 1.09 *1.09.

1.09
x1.09
--------
Multiply 1.09 by 9: 9.81
Multiply 1.09 by 0 (since it's the second digit, tens place), shifted one position: 109.0 (but wait, no, actually, when you do 1.09 * 1.09, it's 1.09 multiplied by 1.09, so let me do it properly.

Wait, perhaps a miscalculation happened.

Let me compute 1.09 * 1.09:

1.09
times 1.09
-----------
First, multiply 1.09 by 9 (the cents part): 9.81
Then, multiply 1.09 by 0 (since the 1 is in the units place, it's actually 1.09*1.00, so 1.09, but shifted one position to the left because it's the tens place). So adding 9.81 and 109.0 gives 118.81. Wait, no, that can't be right because 1.09 is just over 1, and squaring it should be around 1.1881.

Wait, no, actually, I'm confusing the decimal points. Let me compute 109 * 109, then adjust for decimals.

109 * 109: 100*100=10,000, 100*9=900, 9*100=900, 9*9=81. So 10,000 + 900 + 900 +81 = 11,881. So 109 * 109 is 11,881. Since each 109 has two decimal places (because it's 1.09), the total is four decimal places. So 11,881 becomes 1.1881.

So yes, 1.09^2 is 1.1881.

So 10 / 1.1881 = ?

Let me compute 10 divided by 1.1881.

1.1881 * 8 = 9.5048. 10 - 9.5048 = 0.4952.

So 0.4952 / 1.1881 = approximately 0.416.

So total is approximately 8.416, so 8.42. So option B.

But wait, let me check the options again. Option F is 8.70, which is higher. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula. Wait, present value is FV/(1+r)^n. So 10/(1.09)^2.

Wait, another approach: 1.09^2 is 1.1881, so 1/1.1881 is approximately 0.8417. So 10 * 0.8417 is 8.417, which is about 8.42. So option B.

So why is option F 8.70? Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the rate is 9% but it's simple interest, not compound. Oh, but the question says discount rate, which usually implies compound unless stated otherwise. But let me check with simple interest.

If it's simple interest, then the present value would be FV/(1 + rt). So r=9%, t=2, so denominator is 1 + 0.09*2 = 1.18. So 10/1.18 is approximately 8.4746, which is about 8.47. That's closer to option F:8.70, but not exactly.

Wait, 10/1.18 is 8.4746. So option F is 8.70, which is higher than 8.47. So that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the periods. Wait, the time is two years, so n=2, correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should use the TVM formula approach. Alternatively, using logarithms or exponentials, but that's probably unnecessary here.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me compute 10 / 1.1881 more accurately.

Let me do this division more precisely.

1.1881 * 8 = 9.5048
Subtract from 10: 10 - 9.5048 = 0.4952
Bring down a zero: 4.952
1.1881 goes into 4.952 how many times? Let's see:

1.1881 * 4 = 4.7524
Subtract from 4.952: 4.952 -4.7524 = 0.1996
Bring down a zero: 1.996
1.1881 goes into 1.996 once (1.1881 *1 = 1.1881)
Subtract: 1.996 -1.1881 = 0.8079
Bring down a zero: 8.079
1.1881 *6 = 7.1286
Subtract: 8.079 -7.1286 = 0.9504
Bring down a zero: 9.504
1.1881 *8 =9.5048, which is just a bit more than 9.504, so it's approximately 8. So the division is approximately 8.416... So 8.42.

Therefore, option B:8.42 is correct.

But wait, why did I think option F was 8.70? Let me check the options again.

Options:
A: $10.42
B: $8.42
C: $8.26
D: $11
E: $7.92
F: $8.70
G: $9
H: $7.85
I: $10.09
J: $9.50

So option F is $8.70. So that's higher than our calculated 8.42. So I think I must have done the calculation right because the present value is definitely less than $10, so options A and I can be eliminated because they're over $10. Option D is $11, which is way too high. So the correct answer should be B, 8.42.

To calculate the present value of $10 received in two years with a discount rate of 9%, we use the present value formula:

\[
PV = \frac{FV}{(1 + r)^n}
\]

Where:
- \( FV = 10 \) (the future value),
- \( r = 0.09 \) (the discount rate),
- \( n = 2 \) (the number of years).

First, calculate the denominator:

\[
(1 + 0.09)^2 = 1.09^2 = 1.1881
\]

Now, divide the future value by this factor:

\[
PV = \frac{10}{1.1881} \approx 8.417
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, the present value is approximately **$8.42**.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A: $10.42** — Too high, as the present value must be less than the future value.
- **B: $8.42** — Matches the calculated value.
- **C: $8.26** — Too low compared to the calculation.
- **D: $11** — Far too high, not plausible.
- **E: $7.92** — Too low compared to the calculation.
- **F: $8.70** — Higher than the calculated value, not correct.
- **G: $9** — Higher than the calculated value, not correct.
- **H: $7.85** — Too low compared to the calculation.
- **I: $10.09** — Too high, as the present value must be less than the future value.
- **J: $9.50** — Higher than the calculated value, not correct.

The correct answer is **B: $8.42**.
