Okay, so I've got this question here about binary codes and efficiency compared to a decimal system. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is asking, I think, how many bits are needed to represent 110 different codewords, and then evaluate the efficiency of using binary compared to a decimal system for the same task. Alright, so first, I need to figure out the number of bits required.

I remember that in binary, each bit represents a power of 2. So the number of different values you can have with n bits is 2^n. We need to find the smallest n where 2^n is at least 110.

Let me calculate some powers of 2. 2^6 is 64, which is less than 110. 2^7 is 128, which is more than 110. So that means we need 7 bits because 6 isn't enough.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: sometimes people use the formula n = log2(k), where k is the number of codewords. So taking log base 2 of 110. Let me compute that. Log2(128) is 7, so log2(110) is a bit less than 7, like around 6.78. But since you can't have a fraction of a bit, you have to round up to the next whole number, which is 7. So 7 bits are needed.

Okay, so the first part is 7 bits. Now looking at the options, H is 7 bits, 97% efficiency, and I is 7 bits, 89%. So between those.

Now the second part is the efficiency compared to a decimal system. Hmm. I need to figure out what that means. Efficiency here probably refers to how much information is actually used compared to the maximum possible.

Wait, but wait. The efficiency between binary and decimal? Or perhaps the efficiency of the binary system in representing the 110 codewords compared to the decimal system's efficiency in doing the same. Hmm, maybe I need to think about how many symbols each system uses and compare their efficiency.

Wait, another angle: for a given number of symbols, the efficiency is the ratio of the actual information content to the maximum possible. So for binary, each symbol is a bit, which can be 0 or 1. For decimal, each symbol is a digit (0-9), so 10 possibilities.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the question says "evaluate its efficiency as compared to a decimal system to accomplish the same task." So same task is representing 110 codewords. So perhaps we calculate the number of symbols each system would use and then find the efficiency.

Wait, maybe it's about the information entropy. Oh right, information theory concepts. The efficiency of a code is often the ratio of the source entropy to the entropy of the code.

But wait, perhaps a simpler approach. Let's think about how many different values each system can represent with a certain number of digits.

In a decimal system, each digit has 10 possibilities. So for m decimal digits, you can represent 10^m different numbers. We need to find the m such that 10^m is at least 110.

10^2 is 100, which is less than 110. 10^3 is 1000, which is more than 110. So m would be 3 digits in decimal.

So to represent 110 codewords, in decimal you need 3 digits. Each digit can be 0-9, so 10 possibilities.

In binary, as we found, you need 7 bits. Each bit has 2 possibilities.

The efficiency is probably (number of possible codewords) / (total possible combinations of the code). So for binary, the maximum possible is 2^7 =128. So the efficiency is 110/128. Let's compute that: 110 divided by 128 is 0.859375, so approximately 86%. 

Wait, but wait. Then for the decimal system, the maximum possible with 3 digits is 1000. So efficiency is 110/1000 = 0.11, which is 11%. But that seems really low. Alternatively, maybe we compare the entropy or something else.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The efficiency of a code is sometimes the ratio of the minimum number of bits required (using the most efficient code) to the actual bits used. But maybe that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the question is comparing the efficiency in terms of the number of bits used per symbol. Wait, no, that might not make sense since in decimal each digit is one symbol but can represent more information.

Wait, perhaps it's about the amount of information each system can carry per symbol. Hmm.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the efficiency is the ratio of the number of bits used in binary to the number of digits used in decimal, multiplied by the information per bit versus per digit. But I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, perhaps the efficiency is the ratio of the actual information (log2(110)) to the number of bits used. Or something like that. Let me think.

The source entropy is log2(110) ≈ 6.78 bits. The code uses 7 bits, so the efficiency is (6.78 /7)*100 ≈ 96.85% efficiency. But wait, that's not matching any of the options. The options for H are 97%, which is close to that 96.85. So perhaps that's the case.

But wait, the question is comparing the binary system's efficiency to the decimal system's. So maybe I need to compute the efficiency for each and then compare.

Wait, the efficiency of a code is typically the ratio of the entropy to the average length. So for binary, the entropy is log2(110) ≈6.78, and the code uses 7 bits per codeword. So the efficiency is 6.78 /7 ≈ 0.97, so 97% efficient. That would match option H.

But for the decimal system, each codeword is 3 digits, so 3 symbols. The entropy is log10(110) ≈2.04. So the efficiency would be 2.04/(3* log2(10)) )? Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, the entropy in bits is log2(110) ≈6.78 bits. Each decimal digit carries log2(10)≈3.32 bits of information. So for 3 digits, the total is 9.96 bits. So the efficiency would be 6.78 /9.96 ≈ 68%. But that's just me thinking.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try an alternative approach. The question is about the efficiency of the binary code compared to the decimal system. So perhaps the efficiency is the ratio of the number of bits needed in binary to the number of digits needed in decimal, each multiplied by their respective information per bit or digit.

Wait, no, perhaps it's the information content per symbol. Each binary bit carries 1 bit of information, each decimal digit about 3.32 bits. So if you have 7 bits, that's 7 bits. In decimal, you need 3 digits, which can carry 3*3.32=9.96 bits. So the binary is 7 bits, decimal is 3 digits, which is more efficient in terms of information per symbol. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe the efficiency is the ratio of the code's efficiency to the maximum possible. For binary, with 7 bits, maximum possible codewords is 128, so 110/128 is about 86%. For decimal, 3 digits give 1000, so 110/1000 is 11% efficient. But the question is comparing binary to decimal, so perhaps the binary is more efficient, like 86% compared to 11%. But the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the efficiency as the number of bits required in binary compared to decimal, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the efficiency is calculated as (number of bits in binary) / (number of digits in decimal) * 100. So 7 bits vs. 3 digits. 7/3 is approximately 2.333, which is 233%—but that can't be right because the options don't have that. So that approach must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps it's the other way around: the efficiency is (number of decimal digits used)/(number of binary bits) *100. So 3/7 is about 42.8%, but again, that's not in the options.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me re-read the question.

The question says: calculate the number of bits required [so 7 bits] and evaluate its efficiency as compared to a decimal system to accomplish the same task.

So maybe the efficiency is the ratio of the number of bits in binary to the number of digits in decimal. But 7 bits is more than 3 digits, but the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the efficiency is the ratio of the information-theoretic minimum to the actual bits used. Wait, that would be for the binary system. But the question compares to the decimal system.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The binary code uses 7 bits, which can represent 128 codewords. The number of required codewords is 110. So the efficiency is 110/128 = 0.859 or 85.9%. So approximately 86% efficiency.

Looking at the options, H is 7 bits, 97% efficiency. I is 7 bits, 89%. So that's 86%, which is close to option I (89%) but not exact. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 110 divided by 128: 128 goes into 110 zero times. Let me compute it correctly: 110 /128 = 0.859375, so 85.9375%. So about 86%, which is closest to 85% or 86%. Looking at the options, option J is 6 bits, 85%. But wait, 6 bits can only represent 64 codewords, which is less than 110. So option J is 6 bits, which is insufficient, so it can't be the right choice for the number of bits. So perhaps the correct number of bits is 7, and the efficiency is 86%, but the options don't have exactly that.

Wait, looking again at the options:

H:7 bits, 97% efficiency

I:7 bits, 89%

So 7 bits is correct for the first part. The efficiency is 110/128=85.9%, which is approximately 86%. None of the options exactly say 86%, but option I is 89%, which is close, and option H is 97% which is much higher. So why is option H 97%?

Wait, perhaps the efficiency is calculated differently. Maybe it's (number of bits required by the source)/(number of bits used). The source entropy is log2(110)≈6.78 bits. The code uses 7 bits, so efficiency is (6.78/7)*100 ≈96.85%, which is about 97%. That would match option H.

Ah, I think that's it. So the efficiency is the ratio of the source entropy to the channel capacity or average code length. So the source entropy is the minimum average bits needed, which is log2(110)=6.78, and the code uses 7 bits per codeword. So the efficiency is 6.78 /7 ≈96.86%, which is approximately 97%, so option H.

So the correct answer would be H:7 bits, 97% efficiency.

Wait, but let me make sure. So the source produces 110 different messages, each with equal probability. The entropy is H = log2(110) ≈6.78 bits per symbol. The code uses fixed-length codes of 7 bits. So the average code length L is 7. The efficiency is H/L = 6.78/7≈0.9685, so 96.85% efficiency. That's option H:7 bits, 97% efficiency.

So the correct answer should be H.

To determine the number of bits required to represent 110 different codewords in a binary system, we calculate the smallest \( n \) such that \( 2^n \geq 110 \). 

- \( 2^6 = 64 \), which is less than 110.
- \( 2^7 = 128 \), which is greater than 110.

Thus, 7 bits are required. 

Next, to evaluate the efficiency of the binary system compared to a decimal system, we consider the following:

1. **Binary System Efficiency**:  
   The efficiency of a code is the ratio of the source entropy to the average code length. The source entropy for 110 codewords is \( \log_2(110) \approx 6.78 \) bits. Since the binary code uses 7 bits per codeword, the efficiency is:  
   \[
   \text{Efficiency} = \frac{\log_2(110)}{7} \approx \frac{6.78}{7} \approx 0.9685 \, \text{or} \, 96.85\%.
   \]  
   This rounds to approximately 97%.

2. **Decimal System Efficiency**:  
   In a decimal system, each digit has 10 possibilities. To represent 110 codewords, we need \( m \) such that \( 10^m \geq 110 \).  
   - \( 10^2 = 100 \), which is less than 110.  
   - \( 10^3 = 1000 \), which is greater than 110.  

   Thus, 3 decimal digits are required. The efficiency of the decimal system is:  
   \[
   \text{Efficiency} = \frac{110}{10^3} = \frac{110}{1000} = 0.11 \, \text{or} \, 11\%.
   \]  

   Comparing the two systems, the binary system is significantly more efficient than the decimal system for this task.

From the given options, the correct choice is **H: 7 bits, 97% efficiency**, as it matches the calculated number of bits and efficiency for the binary system.

Answer: H
