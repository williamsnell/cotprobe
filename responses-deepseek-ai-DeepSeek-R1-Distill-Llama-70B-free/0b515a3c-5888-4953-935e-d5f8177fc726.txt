Okay, so I have this question about double taxation in the corporate income tax system. Hmm, I remember from my economics class that double taxation has something to do with how corporations and their shareholders are taxed. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the question is asking what the "double taxation" problem refers to. I know that corporations pay taxes on their earnings. But then, when they distribute dividends to shareholders, those dividends are considered income for the shareholders, so they get taxed again on that. That means the same income is taxed twiceâ€”once at the corporate level and once at the individual level when the dividends are paid out.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that describes this situation.

Option A says it's applying two different types of taxes on the same income source. That sounds a bit right because corporate tax and personal income tax are different types. But I'm not sure if that's the exact definition here.

Option B mentions taxes on revenue and profits. Wait, revenue is the total income, and profits are after expenses. But I think the double taxation is more about profits being taxed at the corporate level and then again when distributed as dividends. So B might not be correct.

Option C talks about an individual being taxed twice on their personal income in the same year. That doesn't directly relate to the corporate aspect. So probably not C.

Option D is about paying taxes in two different years, which doesn't fit because the issue is about the same income being taxed twice, not the timing.

Option E is about taxing imported goods twice. That's more related to tariffs or customs, not income tax, so E is out.

Option F mentions companies paying the same tax in two states. That's about multiple jurisdictions, not the same income being taxed twice. So F isn't right.

Option G says when two shareholders are taxed on the same income. I think this is about the same income being taxed at two levels (corporate and individual), not multiple shareholders. So G might not be it.

Option H refers to state and federal taxes. That's about different levels of government, not the corporate and individual level. So H is probably not the answer.

Option I talks about a corporation being taxed on earnings and investments. That's a bit confusing. If a corporation invests its earnings, like in new projects or buying other companies, I don't think that's the same as dividends. So I might not be correct.

Option J states that corporate income is taxed twice: once at the corporate level and again when dividends are distributed to stockholders. That exactly matches what I was thinking earlier. The corporation pays tax on its profits, and then the shareholders pay tax on the dividends they receive from those profits. So J sounds right.

Wait, let me double-check the other options again. Option A says two different taxes on the same income. That's somewhat correct, but J is more specific about the corporate and personal level. So J is a better answer.

I think the correct answer is J.

The correct answer is J. Double taxation occurs when corporate income is taxed at the corporate level and again at the personal level when dividends are distributed to shareholders.
