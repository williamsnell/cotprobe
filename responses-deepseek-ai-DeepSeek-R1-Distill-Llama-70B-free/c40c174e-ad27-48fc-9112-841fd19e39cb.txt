Question:

Define behaviorism and social learning theory.

Options:

A: Behaviorism focuses on the analysis of human emotions as the primary factor in behavior, whereas social learning theory emphasizes the role of instinctual drives.
B: Behaviorism refers to a theory that considers only observable behavior. Social learning theory is based on the fact that children imitate and includes the importance of dependency as the major factor that brings about socialization.
C: Social learning theory is a subset of behaviorism that deals exclusively with verbal learning and linguistics.
D: Social learning theory is solely about children's aggression.
E: Behaviorism is a theory that emphasizes the importance of supernatural influences on behavior, while social learning theory focuses on the impact of societal norms only.
F: Behaviorism is concerned with unobservable mental processes.
G: Social learning theory suggests that behavior is entirely shaped by peer pressure, while behaviorism states that behavior is a result of conscious decision-making.
H: Behaviorism and social learning theory both argue that behavior is a direct consequence of divine will, without the influence of the environment or cognition.
I: Behaviorism is based on the idea that behavior is determined by past life experiences, while social learning theory asserts that behavior is solely a result of genetic inheritance.
J: Behaviorism believes in the major role of intrinsic factors in behavior.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about behaviorism and social learning theory. I remember from my psychology class that these are two different theories, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think this through step by step.

First, what is behaviorism? I recall that behaviorism is a psychological approach that focuses on observable behaviors rather than internal mental processes. So behaviorists like Skinner and Pavlov probably studied how external factors, like rewards or punishments, influence behavior. They didn't really care about what's going on in the mind, just what they could see and measure. So behaviorism is all about observable behavior. 

Now, social learning theory. I think this is more about how people learn new behaviors by observing and imitating others. Bandura comes to mind, especially his Bobo doll experiment where kids imitated aggressive behavior. So, social learning theory says that we learn from observing others and then imitating them. It's not just about environment or genetics, but about how we observe and model behavior.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one correctly defines both theories. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A says behaviorism focuses on human emotions as the primary factor. No, that doesn't sound right. Behaviorism is about observable behavior, not emotions which are internal.

Option B: Behaviorism considers only observable behavior. That's correct. Social learning says children imitate and includes dependency. Wait, dependency? I'm not too sure about that part. Social learning does involve imitation, but dependency as a major factor? Maybe. I'm not certain.

Option C states that social learning is a subset of behaviorism dealing with verbal learning. Hmm, I don't think that's right. Social learning is its own theory, though it might have some overlap with behaviorism. But focusing solely on verbal learning seems off.

Option D says social learning is solely about children's aggression. No, that's too narrow. Social learning applies to all kinds of behaviors, not just aggression.

Option E: Behaviorism involves supernatural influences. No, behaviorism is about observable, natural factors, not supernatural.

Option F: Behaviorism concerns unobservable mental processes. No, that's the opposite. Behaviorism ignores mental processes, focusing only on observable behavior.

Option G: Social learning suggests behavior is entirely shaped by peer pressure. No, it's more about observation and imitation, not just peer pressure. Behaviorism being about conscious decisions? I don't think so. Behaviorism is more about external stimuli, not conscious choices.

Option H: Both theories say behavior is from divine will. No, that's not right. Both are psychological theories focusing on observable factors, not divine.

Option I: Behaviorism is about past life experiences. Well, behaviorism does look at past experiences in terms of conditioning, but the second part says social learning is solely genetic, which isn't correct. Social learning is about environment and observation.

Option J: Behaviorism believes in intrinsic factors. No, behaviorism is about extrinsic factors like environment and stimuli.

So, going back to Option B. It says behaviorism refers to only observable behavior. Correct. Social learning theory is based on children imitating and includes dependency as a major factor. Wait, dependency? I'm trying to remember. Social learning theory does include concepts like observation, imitation, and modeling. But what about dependency? Oh, wait, maybe it's referring to how children depend on others to learn behaviors. Or perhaps it's mixing up with other theories. Alternatively, maybe the second part is incorrect. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B, because the first part is correct about behaviorism, and the second part about social learning is at least partially correct, even if the dependency part is a bit unclear. Or maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps another option is correct. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: what's the exact definition.

Behaviorism: Focuses on observable behavior, discounts mental processes. So any option that says behaviorism is about observable behavior is correct.

Social learning theory: People learn by observing others and imitating. Also, it includes concepts like reinforcement, but more about observation. So the question is, which option correctly states that.

Looking again at option B: Social learning theory is based on children imitating and includes the importance of dependency. Hmm. I'm not sure about the dependency part. Maybe it's referring to how children depend on observing others. Alternatively, maybe the option is inaccurate.

Wait, another thought: social learning theory emphasizes not just imitation but also the role of reinforcement. But I think the key is that it's about learning through observation.

Looking again, option B says social learning includes the importance of dependency as a major factor. I'm not sure. Another option: perhaps I should look for an option that states social learning is about imitation and observation, without mentioning dependency.

Wait, but looking back, the options may not have a perfect match. Let me review all options again.

Option B: Behaviorism considers only observable behavior. Correct. Social learning is about imitation and dependency. Maybe the dependency part is incorrect, but the first part is correct.

Option I: Behaviorism is about past experiences, which is somewhat correct because behaviorism uses conditioning based on past experiences. But the second part says social learning is solely genetic, which is wrong. So I can eliminate that.

What about option J: Behaviorism believes in intrinsic factors. No, behaviorism is about extrinsic.

Option E is about supernatural, which is wrong.

So perhaps the correct answer is B, even if the part about dependency isn't exactly right, because the other options are more clearly incorrect.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the dependency part. Maybe I'm mixing it up with another theory. Wait, dependency is more of a psychoanalytic concept, like in attachment theory. So perhaps option B is incorrect in that aspect.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the options again.

The correct statements are:

Behaviorism: Focuses on observable behavior, not mental processes.

Social Learning Theory: Emphasizes learning through observation and imitation.

Looking at the options, which one matches this?

Looking again:

Option B: Behaviorism correct. Social learning part says 'children imitate and includes the importance of dependency as the major factor.' Hmm, I'm not sure if dependency is a major factor. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B because it's the closest.

Another approach: the correct answer should have behaviorism about observable behavior and social learning about imitation/observation.

Looking at the options, option B says social learning is based on children imitating, which is correct. The part about dependency as a major factor might be an error, but it's possible that the option is correct despite that.

Alternatively, perhaps none of the options are perfect, but B is the best fit.

Behaviorism is a psychological theory that focuses solely on observable behavior, discounting internal mental processes. It examines how external factors, such as rewards or punishments, influence behavior. On the other hand, social learning theory emphasizes the idea that people learn new behaviors by observing and imitating others. This theory, often associated with Albert Bandura, suggests that observation, imitation, and reinforcement play key roles in learning. While the mention of "dependency" in Option B is somewhat unclear, it likely refers to the idea that children depend on observing others to learn behaviors. Despite this ambiguity, Option B aligns most closely with the correct definitions of both theories compared to the other options.
