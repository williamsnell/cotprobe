Okay, so I've got this question about determining the open-to-buy for a shirt buyer at a department store. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on retail math, but let me think through this step by step.

Okay, the question gives me several figures as of January 17th. Let me list them out to keep track:

- Present inventory at retail: $12,000
- Inventory commitments: $3,000
- Planned end-of-month inventory: $15,000
- Planned sales: $6,000
- Actual sales: $3,000
- Planned markdowns: $500
- Actual markdowns: $200

Wait, I remember that the open-to-buy is the amount the buyer can spend to purchase new merchandise. It's like the budget they have available for buying more stock. The formula, I think, involves the planned end-of-month inventory, plus planned sales, and then subtracting the current inventory and any commitments already made, but I'm not sure about the exact formula.

Let me try to recall. Oh right, the open-to-buy formula is:

Open-to-Buy = (Planned End-of-Month Inventory + Planned Sales) - (Current Inventory + Inventory Commitments) + (Markdowns)

Wait, or is it that markdowns are subtracted? Or added? Hmm, maybe I should think about it in terms of the total needed.

Wait, another approach: The open-to-buy is the amount needed to reach the planned inventory after considering sales and markdowns. So maybe the formula is:

Open-to-Buy = (Planned End of Month Inventory) + (Planned Sales) - (Beginning Inventory) - (Inventory Commitments) + (Markdown Allowance) 

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Oh, wait, maybe it's:

Open-to-Buy = (Planned End-of-Month Inventory) + (Planned Sales) - (Current Inventory + Inventory Commitments) + (Markdowns) 

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think of it as the total needed to have the planned end inventory after selling the planned amount and accounting for markdowns.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

Open-to-Buy = (Planned End-of-Month Inventory) - (Beginning Inventory - Actual Sales - Actual Markdowns + Inventory Commitments)

Wait, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, the formula I remember is Open-to-Buy = (Planned Sales + Planned End Inventory) - (Beginning Inventory + Commitments) + Markdowns.

Wait, let's try to break it down.

First, the planned sales for the period (from Jan 17 to Jan 31) are $6,000. The planned end-of-month inventory is $15,000. So, the total needed to cover sales and end inventory is 6,000 +15,000 = $21,000.

Now, the current inventory is $12,000, and there are commitments (which are goods already ordered but not yet received) of $3,000. So the total available is 12,000 +3,000 = $15,000.

But wait, what about markdowns? Markdowns are reductions in prices, so they affect the inventory value. Oh, but in this context, I think the markdowns are the actual markdowns that have already occurred. So, perhaps the calculation needs to adjust for the markdowns that happened beyond what was planned.

Wait, but how does that fit in? Let me think: The planned markdowns are $500, and actual are $200. So the markdowns are less than planned, meaning that the inventory is worth more than expected. So perhaps that affects the beginning inventory.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is:

Open-to-Buy = (Planned End Inventory + Planned Sales) - (Beginning Inventory + Inventory Commitments) + (Planned Markdowns - Actual Markdowns)

Wait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the markdowns are subtracted from the beginning inventory because they reduce the value of the inventory.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me look for another approach. I remember that the open-to-buy can be calculated as:

Open-to-Buy = (Planned Sales + Planned End Inventory) - (Beginning Inventory + Inventory Commitments) + Markdown Allowance

Wait, but Markdown Allowance could refer to the planned markdowns, or maybe it's the actual markdowns.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

Open-to-Buy = (Planned Sales + Planned End Inventory) - (Beginning Inventory + Commitments + Markdowns)

But I'm not sure. Let me try plugging in the numbers with different approaches.

First approach:

Planned Sales: $6,000

Planned End Inventory: $15,000

Sum: 6,000 +15,000 = $21,000

Current Inventory: $12,000

Commitments: $3,000

So, 12,000 +3,000 = $15,000

So, 21,000 (needed) -15,000 (available) = $6,000

But then what about markdowns? The actual markdowns are $200, which is less than the planned $500. So perhaps the markdowns are a subtraction from the current inventory.

Wait, if markdowns are $200, then the current inventory is reduced by that amount. So 12,000 -200 = 11,800. Then add commitments: 11,800 +3,000 =14,800.

So needed is 21,000. Available is 14,800. So open-to-buy is 21,000 -14,800 = $6,200.

But looking at the options, I don't see that. The options are A:18,300; B:12,200; C:5,000; D:10,800; E:3,300; F:2,800; G:15,000; H:6,000; I:7,700; J:9,500.

Hmm, $6,200 isn't an option, but option H is $6,000. Close, but perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, maybe I should not subtract the actual markdowns from the beginning inventory. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

Open-to-Buy = (Planned Sales + Planned End Inventory) - (Beginning Inventory + Inventory Commitments - Markdowns)

Wait, that would be 6,000 +15,000 =21,000

Minus (12,000 +3,000 -200) = 14,800

So 21,000 -14,800 =6,200. Same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the markdowns are added. Because if you have more markdowns than planned, you might have more inventory left, needing less to buy. Or wait, markdowns reduce the inventory value, so perhaps the beginning inventory is adjusted by subtracting markdowns.

Wait, perhaps it's:

Open-to-Buy = (Planned End Inventory + Planned Sales) - (Current Inventory + Commitments - Actual Markdowns)

So that would be 15,000 +6,000 =21,000

Minus (12,000 +3,000 -200) =14,800

So 21,000 -14,800 =6,200. Again, same number.

But the options don't have 6,200. So perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, maybe the formula is:

Open-to-Buy = (Planned Sales + Planned End Inventory) - (Beginning Inventory + Commitments) + (Planned Markdowns - Actual Markdowns)

Wait, that would be 21,000 -15,000 + (500 -200) =6,000 +300= $6,300.

Still not matching any option. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is:

Open-to-Buy = (Planned End Inventory + Planned Sales) - (Beginning Inventory + Commitments) + (Markdown Allowance)

Where Markdown Allowance is the planned markdowns. So:

21,000 -15,000 +500=6,500. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

Open-to-Buy = (Planned End Inventory + (Planned Sales - Planned Markdowns)) - (Beginning Inventory + Commitments)

So: 15,000 + (6,000 -500) = 15,000 +5,500=20,500

Minus (12,000 +3,000) =15,000.

So 20,500 -15,000=5,500. Not an option either.

Wait, maybe the actual markdowns are considered as part of the current inventory. So the beginning inventory is reduced by actual markdowns.

So, adjusted beginning inventory is 12,000 -200=11,800.

Then, 11,800 +3,000=14,800.

Needed is 6,000 (sales) +15,000 (end inventory) =21,000.

21,000 -14,800=6,200. Still not an option.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think again.

Wait, another possible formula is Open-to-Buy = (Planned Sales + Planned End Inventory) - (Beginning Inventory + Commitments) + (Markdown Allowance). Or perhaps the markdowns are subtracted.

Alternatively, perhaps markdowns are not part of the open-to-buy calculation. Let's try that.

So, Open-to-Buy = (Planned Sales + Planned End Inventory) - (Beginning Inventory + Commitments)

That would be 6,000 +15,000=21,000

Minus (12,000 +3,000)=15,000

So 21,000 -15,000=6,000.

Ah, that's option H: $6,000. But wait, but then we're ignoring the markdowns. Or perhaps the markdowns are already included in the planned end inventory.

Hmm, maybe that's the case. Let me think: the planned end inventory is after markdowns, so the markdowns are already accounted for in that figure. So perhaps the actual markdowns aren't needed in the calculation because the planned end inventory already reflects the planned markdowns.

Wait, if that's the case, then the calculation is simply 6,000 +15,000 =21,000

Minus (12,000 +3,000)=15,000

So 6,000.

Which is option H.

But wait, the question gives the planned markdowns as $500 and actual as $200. So perhaps the actual markdowns are less than planned, meaning that the inventory is higher than expected. Therefore, the buyer may have more inventory than planned, so the open-to-buy would be less.

But how does that affect the calculation?

Wait, perhaps the formula should adjust the beginning inventory by the difference between planned and actual markdowns. So, the planned markdowns were $500, but actual was $200, so the beginning inventory is effectively $200 higher than planned.

Wait, so the present inventory is $12,000, but because actual markdowns are $200 less than planned ($500), the inventory is $200 higher than expected. So perhaps we adjust the beginning inventory upwards by $200.

So, adjusted beginning inventory would be 12,000 + (500 -200)=12,300.

Wait, no, that would be if the actual markdowns were higher. Wait, if the actual markdowns are less than planned, then the inventory is higher. So, the beginning inventory is $12,000, but with less markdown, so it's worth more. So perhaps the inventory available is higher.

So, the calculation would be:

Planned Sales + Planned End Inventory =6,000 +15,000=21,000

Minus (Beginning Inventory + Commitments - Markdowns)

Wait, because Markdowns reduce inventory. Wait, perhaps the formula is:

Open-to-Buy = (Planned Sales + Planned End Inventory) - (Beginning Inventory + Commitments - (Planned Markdowns - Actual Markdowns))

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Alternatively, perhaps we should calculate the beginning inventory after markdowns.

So, adjusted beginning inventory = $12,000 - actual markdowns=12,000 -200=11,800

Then, add commitments:11,800 +3,000=14,800

So, needed is 21,000 (6k+15k). So 21,000 -14,800=6,200.

But that's not an option. So perhaps the markdowns are not considered in this calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

Open-to-Buy = (Planned End Inventory + Planned Sales) - (Beginning Inventory + Commitments) + (Planned Markdowns - Actual Markdowns)

So, 6k +15k=21k

Minus (12k+3k)=15k

Plus (500 -200)=300.

So 21k -15k=6k +300=6,300.

Still not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps it's (Planned End + Planned Sales) - (Beginning + Commitments + Actual Markdowns)

So 21k - (12k +3k +200)=21k -15,200=5,800. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

Open-to-Buy = (Planned End Inventory + (Planned Sales - Planned Markdowns)) - (Beginning Inventory + Commitments)

So, planned sales are 6k, planned markdowns 500, so net sales would be 5,500.

Plus planned end inventory 15k=20,500.

Minus (12k +3k)=15k.

So 20,500 -15,000=5,500. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps it's:

Open-to-Buy = (Planned End Inventory + (Planned Sales - Actual Markdowns)) - (Beginning Inventory + Commitments)

So, 15k + (6k -200)=15k +5,800=20,800

Minus 15k=5,800. Still not matching.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back to the basics.

The open-to-buy is the amount the buyer can spend on purchasing new merchandise. It's based on how much inventory is needed by the end of the month, considering the sales and markdowns.

So the formula I think is:

Open-to-Buy = (Planned Sales + Planned End Inventory) - (Beginning Inventory + Inventory Commitments) + Adjustments for Markdowns.

But perhaps the markdowns are subtracted from the beginning inventory because they reduce the value.

Wait, let me try this:

Planned Sales: 6,000

Planned End Inventory:15,000

So total needed: 21,000

Current Inventory:12,000

Commitments:3,000

Markdowns: actual 200, planned 500.

So, perhaps the beginning inventory after markdowns is 12,000 -200=11,800.

So available is 11,800 +3,000=14,800.

So, needed:21,000 -14,800=6,200.

But that's not an option. So perhaps the markdowns are not part of the calculation, which brings us back to 6,000 as the open-to-buy.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula doesn't include markdowns because they are already accounted for in the planned end inventory.

Wait, the planned end inventory is after considering markdowns, so maybe the markdowns don't need to be added or subtracted in the open-to-buy calculation.

In that case, the calculation is (6,000 +15,000) - (12,000 +3,000) =6,000.

Which is option H.

But then, the actual markdowns being less than planned would mean that the end inventory would be higher than planned, so perhaps the open-to-buy would be adjusted accordingly.

Wait, perhaps the open-to-buy formula doesn't take into account the actual markdowns because it's based on planned figures. So the planned markdowns are $500, so the planned end inventory is after those markdowns.

So the calculation would be (6,000 +15,000) - (12,000 +3,000)=6,000.

So the answer is H:6,000.

Alternatively, perhaps the actual markdowns are considered, which would mean adjusting the beginning inventory.

Wait, let's see. The planned end inventory is $15,000, which already factors in the planned markdowns of $500. So, if the actual markdowns are less, the end inventory would be higher than planned. But in this calculation, we're using the planned end inventory, so perhaps the markdowns don't affect the open-to-buy directly.

So, I think the correct approach is to ignore the actual markdowns and just use the planned figures. Therefore, the open-to-buy is $6,000.
</think>

To determine the open-to-buy, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Open-to-Buy} = (\text{Planned Sales} + \text{Planned End-of-Month Inventory}) - (\text{Beginning Inventory} + \text{Inventory Commitments})
\]

### Given Data:
- **Planned Sales**: $6,000  
- **Planned End-of-Month Inventory**: $15,000  
- **Beginning Inventory**: $12,000  
- **Inventory Commitments**: $3,000  

### Calculation:
1. **Total Needed**:  
   \[
   \text{Planned Sales} + \text{Planned End-of-Month Inventory} = 6,000 + 15,000 = 21,000
   \]

2. **Total Available**:  
   \[
   \text{Beginning Inventory} + \text{Inventory Commitments} = 12,000 + 3,000 = 15,000
   \]

3. **Open-to-Buy**:  
   \[
   \text{Open-to-Buy} = 21,000 - 15,000 = 6,000
   \]

### Consideration of Markdowns:
The problem provides both **Planned Markdowns** ($500) and **Actual Markdowns** ($200). However, the open-to-buy calculation typically uses planned figures, as the planned end-of-month inventory already accounts for planned markdowns. Therefore, the actual markdowns do not directly affect this calculation.

### Conclusion:
The open-to-buy is **$6,000**, which corresponds to **Option H**.
