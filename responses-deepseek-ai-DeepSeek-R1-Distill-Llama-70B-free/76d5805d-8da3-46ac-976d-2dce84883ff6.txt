Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the de Broglie wavelength of a skiing man. Hmm, I remember that the de Broglie wavelength relates the momentum of a particle to its wavelength. The formula is lambda equals h over p, right? Where h is Planck's constant and p is momentum.

Wait, the man's mass is 88 kg, and he's moving at 5.0 × 10^5 cm per second. Oh, wait a second, that velocity seems really high. Let me double-check the units. Oh wait, 5e5 cm/s is 5e5 cm per second. Since 1 meter is 100 cm, so 5e5 cm is 5e3 meters per second. That's 5000 m/s, which is way too fast for a skier. Like, that's faster than a speeding bullet! Skiers don't go that fast. Maybe it's a typo, but I guess I'll proceed with the given numbers.

So momentum p is mass times velocity. The mass is 88 kg, velocity is 5e5 cm/s. Let me convert everything into meters and kilograms because Planck's constant is in J·s, which uses kg, m, s.

Wait, velocity is in cm/s, so 5e5 cm/s is 5e5 / 100 = 5e3 m/s. Yeah, that's what I thought earlier, 5000 m/s. That's super fast, but okay.

So p = m*v. m is 88 kg, v is 5e3 m/s. So p = 88 * 5e3 = 440,000 kg·m/s? Wait, 88 *5 is 440, so 88 *5e3 is 4.4e5 kg·m/s.

Planck's constant h is 6.626 × 10^-34 J·s. But J is kg·m²/s², so h has units kg·m²/s. So when we divide h by p, the units will be (kg·m²/s) / (kg·m/s) )= m. That makes sense for wavelength.

So lambda is h/(m*v). Let me plug in the numbers.

h = 6.626e-34
m*v = 88 kg * 5e3 m/s = 4.4e5 kg·m/s.

So lambda = (6.626e-34) / (4.4e5) 

Let me compute this. 6.626e-34 divided by 4.4e5 is approximately (6.626 /4.4) * 1e-39.

6.626 divided by 4.4 is about 1.506. So 1.5e-38 m? Wait, wait, wait. Because 1e-34 divided by 1e5 is 1e-39. So yes, 1.5e-38 m. Wait, no: 6.626e-34 /4.4e5 = (6.626/4.4) * 1e-34-5 = 1.506 * 1e-39, which is 1.506e-39 meters.

Wait, but wait, 1 meter is 100 cm, so to convert to cm, we multiply by 100. So 1.506e-39 m = 1.506e-37 cm. Oh wait, wait: 1 m = 100 cm. So 1.506e-39 m is 1.506e-39 * 100 cm = 1.506e-37 cm.

Looking at the options, which one is around 1.5e-37 cm? Let me check the options.

Options:

A: 7.5 × 10^-38 cm
B: 8.0 × 10^-38 cm
C: 2.5 × 10^-37 cm
D: 1.7 × 10-^37 cm [Wait, exponent typo?]
E: 2.0 × 10-^37 cm [Same typo?]
F: 1.5 × 10-^37 cm [Exponent typo again]
G: 1.2 × 10^-36 cm
H: 3.0 × 10^-37 cm
I: 1.0 × 10^-36 cm
J: 1.0 × 10-^37 cm

Hmm, the exponents in some options have a caret, which is probably a typo. So I think it's supposed to be 10^-37 for D, E, F, J, etc.

So my calculation gives approximately 1.5e-37 cm. Looking at the options, option F is 1.5 ×10^-37 cm. But wait, option F is written as 1.5 × 10-^37 cm, I think it's a typo and should be 10^-37.

So that would be option F.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculation to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

h is 6.626e-34 Js.

p = m*v =88 kg *5e3 m/s = 4.4e5 kg·m/s.

lambda = h/p = (6.626e-34) / (4.4e5) = (6.626 /4.4) * 1e-34-5 = 1.506e-39 m.

Convert meters to cm: 1.506e-39 m * 100 cm/m = 1.506e-37 cm.

Yes, that's correct. So the closest option is F: 1.5e-37 cm. But wait, looking at the options, option F is 1.5 × 10-^37 cm, which I'm assuming is 1.5e-37.

But wait, the options given have several with 1e-37, etc. Let me see. Let me look again.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the velocity unit conversion.

Wait the velocity is given as 5.0 ×10^5 cm/s. Oh wait, that's 5e5 cm/s, which is 5e5 cm per second. Since 1 m is 100 cm, 5e5 cm/s is 5e3 m/s. That's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute h/p.

h=6.626e-34, p=4.4e5.

6.626e-34 /4.4e5 = (6.626 /4.4) * 1e-34-5 = (approx 1.506) * 1e-39 = 1.506e-39 m.

Convert that to cm: 1.506e-39 m = 1.506e-37 cm.

Yes. So 1.5e-37 cm is option F.

Looking back, option F is 1.5 ×10^-37 cm. So that's the correct answer.

To calculate the de Broglie wavelength of an 88 kg man skiing at 5.0 × 10⁵ cm/s, we use the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{p}
\]

where \( h \) is Planck's constant (\( 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)) and \( p \) is the momentum, given by \( p = m \cdot v \).

### Step 1: Convert the velocity to meters per second
The velocity is given as \( 5.0 \times 10^5 \, \text{cm/s} \). Converting to meters per second:
\[
v = \frac{5.0 \times 10^5}{100} = 5.0 \times 10^3 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the momentum
The mass of the man is \( 88 \, \text{kg} \). Momentum is:
\[
p = m \cdot v = 88 \cdot 5.0 \times 10^3 = 4.4 \times 10^5 \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the de Broglie wavelength
Substitute \( h \) and \( p \) into the formula:
\[
\lambda = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{4.4 \times 10^5}.
\]

Perform the division:
\[
\lambda = \frac{6.626}{4.4} \times 10^{-34 - 5} = 1.506 \times 10^{-39} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 4: Convert the wavelength to centimeters
Since \( 1 \, \text{m} = 100 \, \text{cm} \):
\[
\lambda = 1.506 \times 10^{-39} \cdot 100 = 1.506 \times 10^{-37} \, \text{cm}.
\]

### Step 5: Match the result to the closest option
The calculated wavelength is approximately \( 1.5 \times 10^{-37} \, \text{cm} \), which corresponds to **option F**.
