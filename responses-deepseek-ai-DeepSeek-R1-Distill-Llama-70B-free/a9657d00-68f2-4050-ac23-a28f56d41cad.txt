Okay, so I need to find the product of 5.7 multiplied by 8 using the Distributive Property mentally. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the Distributive Property is like breaking down numbers to make multiplication easier. So maybe I can split 8 into smaller parts that are easier to work with.

Wait, 8 is a whole number, but 5.7 is a decimal. Maybe I can think of 8 as 10 minus 2. That might help because multiplying by 10 is straightforward, and then I can subtract the 2 times part. Let me try that.

So, 5.7 times 8 would be the same as 5.7 times (10 - 2), right? Using the distributive property, that's 5.7*10 minus 5.7*2. 

Calculating each part: 5.7 times 10 is 57. That's easy because you just add a zero. Then, 5.7 times 2. Let me think, 5 times 2 is 10, and 0.7 times 2 is 1.4, so adding those gives 11.4.

Wait wait, no, wait. Wait, 5.7*2. Let me double-check that. 5*2 is 10, 0.7*2 is 1.4, so 10 +1.4 is 11.4. So yes, that part is correct.

Now, subtracting the two: 57 minus 11.4. Let me do that subtraction. 57 minus 11 is 46, and then minus 0.4 more would be 45.6. So the result should be 45.6.

Looking at the options, option E is 45.6, so that must be the answer. But wait, let me think again just to be sure. Maybe I can try another method to confirm.

Another approach: 8 times 5 is 40, and 8 times 0.7 is 5.6. So adding 40 and 5.6 gives 45.6. Yep, same result. So I'm confident that E is correct.

The product of 5.7 and 8 can be calculated using the Distributive Property by breaking down 8 into 10 - 2. This gives:

5.7 × 8 = 5.7 × (10 - 2)  
= (5.7 × 10) - (5.7 × 2)  
= 57 - 11.4  
= 45.6.

Thus, the correct answer is:

E: 45.6.
