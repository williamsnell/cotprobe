Okay, so I have this question about cognitive dissonance and forced compliance. Hmm, I remember cognitive dissonance is a concept in psychology where people experience discomfort when their beliefs and actions don't align. Forced compliance refers to situations where someone is made to do something they wouldn't normally do, like agreeing to something they don't believe in.

The question is asking under what conditions a greater change of belief will occur in forced compliance situations. The options are A through J, each giving different scenarios.

I think the key here is understanding the theory correctly. From what I remember, cognitive dissonance theory suggests that when people are forced to comply with a behavior that contradicts their beliefs, they will experience dissonance. To reduce this discomfort, they might change their beliefs to align with their actions.

But wait, the intensity of the dissonance probably matters. If the reward for compliance is large, maybe people are more motivated to comply, but does that mean they'll change their beliefs more? Or perhaps the oppositeâ€”maybe a larger reward reduces the dissonance because they feel justified in their compliance.

Wait, I think I remember something about the size of the reward. There was an experiment where people were paid different amounts to perform a task they didn't like. Those who were paid a small amount ended up liking the task more because they had to justify their effort without a big reward. Whereas those paid a lot didn't feel the need to change their attitude because they were already compensated.

So applying that to forced compliance: if someone is forced to comply and is given a small reward, they might experience more dissonance because the reward isn't sufficient to justify their action. This would push them to change their beliefs more to reduce the discomfort. On the other hand, a large reward might make the compliance feel okay, so they don't feel as much need to change their beliefs.

Looking at the options, option A says "when compliance is accompanied by a small reward." Option E is a large reward. So according to the theory, a small reward would lead to greater belief change. So the correct answer should be A.

Wait, but another thought: forced compliance without any reward might cause the most dissonance. Because if you're forced to do something without any incentive, the only way to reduce the discomfort is to change your belief. But looking at the options, option H says "when compliance is not rewarded." So would that be the case?

Wait, I'm a bit confused now. The original idea was that a small reward leads to more attitude change than a large one. So in that case, option A would be correct. But if the compliance isn't rewarded at all, that might be a different scenario. But the question is about forced compliance situations, which usually involves some kind of pressure, maybe not necessarily rewards.

Wait, in the forced compliance paradigm, people are induced to say or do something contrary to their beliefs. The classic experiment involved paying people to write essays they didn't believe in. Those paid a small amount ended up changing their beliefs more than those paid a large amount. Because with a small reward, they had to justify their action internally by changing their attitudes, since the external reward wasn't enough. So in that case, the presence of a small reward leads to greater belief change than a large reward.

So in the question, the options are about when greater change occurs. So if the compliance is accompanied by a small reward, that's option A, which would lead to greater belief change. If it's a large reward (option E), less change. If there's no reward (option H), perhaps even more change than a small reward?

Wait, I think the theory says that when there's no reward, dissonance is highest because there's nothing to justify the behavior. So in that case, people would change their beliefs more. So option H might be the answer.

Wait, but in the original question, the options are about forced compliance. Forced compliance can sometimes involve rewards, but perhaps the key is the size of the reward. So the theory's main point is that lower rewards (or no reward) cause more attitude change.

Wait, the options are: A is small reward, E is large, H is no reward.

So if the reward is small, there's more change. If no reward, even more. So which option is correct based on the question.

But the question is about forced compliance in general. The text I'm recalling says that in forced compliance, when rewards are low, people experience dissonance and change their attitudes more. So in that case, the correct answer would be A, because a small reward increases the likelihood of belief change.

Wait, but sometimes I've read that when the reward is insufficient, people have to justify their actions by changing their beliefs. So the smaller the reward, the more dissonance, so the more they change their beliefs.

So in the question, the options are:

A: small reward

E: large reward

H: no reward

So if the reward is smaller, the change is greater. So the correct answer would be A.

But wait, another angle: the theory says that if someone is forced to comply and there's no external justification (like a reward), they will experience more dissonance, leading to more belief change. So option H would be when there's no reward, leading to more change. But I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, no, because forced compliance might involve a reward as part of the force. Like, you have to do it and you're paid. So the theory says that a smaller reward leads to more attitude change than a larger one. Because with a large reward, you can say you did it for the money, so no need to change your attitude. But with a small reward, you can't justify it, so you change your belief.

So in the options, option A is small reward, which would cause more belief change. So the correct answer should be H? Or A?

Wait no, no. Wait, in the forced compliance scenario, the presence of a small reward leads to more change than a large reward. So the correct answer would be A because when the reward is small, the change is greater.

But I'm a little shaky on this. I think the correct answer is H, but I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: looking for the answer.

Wait, the answer is H: when compliance is not rewarded. Because without a reward, the person has to change their belief to reduce dissonance. But I'm not sure.

Another thought: the question is about forced compliance leading to change of belief. The theory says that the smaller the reward, the greater the attitude change. So if the reward is small (option A), more change. If there's no reward (option H), that would mean even more change. So which option is correct?

Wait, the options don't include both. So perhaps the correct answer is H, when compliance is not rewarded, meaning no reward, so more change.

But I'm getting confused because I remember the experiments used varying rewards, and small rewards caused more attitude change than large ones. So in that case, the answer would be A.

Wait, but the question is about forced compliance in general. So perhaps the answer is H, because if there's no reward, the dissonance is stronger, leading to more belief change.

Wait, but in the original theory, the scenario involved rewards. So perhaps the correct answer is A.

Alternatively, the answer could be H. I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, I think I need to solidify this. The classic study is the Festinger and Carlsmith experiment. They had participants perform a boring task and then were paid either $1 or $20 to tell someone else that the task was enjoyable. Those paid $1 changed their attitudes more than those paid $20. So in that case, the small reward led to more change. So in forced compliance (being paid to lie), small reward leads to more belief change.

So in the question, the scenario is forced compliance. The options are about when the change is greater. So when the reward is small, change is greater. So the correct answer is A.

But wait, the question says "forced compliance situations". Forced compliance can also refer to situations where there's no reward, like being ordered to do something. So in that case, without any reward, the dissonance is higher, leading to more belief change. So option H says "when compliance is not rewarded", which would imply higher change.

Hmm, this is conflicting.

Wait, in the Festinger and Carlsembly study, the reward was part of the compliance. So they were forced (through payment) to comply. In that case, smaller rewards led to more change.

But the question is about forced compliance in general. So the options include whether it's with a small reward, large reward, or no reward.

If the compliance isn't rewarded (option H), then the person must change their belief to reduce dissonance, leading to more change. So in that case, the answer would be H.

But I'm a bit confused now because the theory can apply in different scenarios.

Wait, the options are:

A: small reward

E: large reward

H: no reward

So according to the theory, when the reward is smaller, the change is greater. So in the case of a small reward (A), more change than a large reward (E). But if there's no reward (H), would that lead to the most change?

Alternatively, perhaps the theory doesn't directly address the no-reward scenario, but in practice, the absence of a reward would mean maximum dissonance, leading to the most change.

But I'm not sure. I think the answer is H, but I'm not 100% certain.

Wait, let me think again. Forced compliance without any reward would cause maximum dissonance because there's no external justification. So the person has to internalize the change in belief to reduce the discomfort. So yes, option H would lead to greater change.

So the correct answer is H.
</think>

According to the theory of cognitive dissonance, greater change of belief occurs in forced compliance situations when there is no external justification, such as a reward, to reduce the discomfort caused by the inconsistency between beliefs and actions. In the classic Festinger and Carlsmith experiment, participants who were paid a small reward to perform a task they didn't enjoy experienced greater attitude change compared to those paid a large reward. This is because a small reward was insufficient to justify the action, leading to internal justification through belief change. However, the question also considers the scenario where compliance is not rewarded at all (option H). In this case, the absence of any reward would likely lead to the greatest dissonance, as there is no external justification, forcing the individual to change their beliefs to align with their actions. Therefore, the correct answer is:

H: when compliance is not rewarded.

Answer: H
