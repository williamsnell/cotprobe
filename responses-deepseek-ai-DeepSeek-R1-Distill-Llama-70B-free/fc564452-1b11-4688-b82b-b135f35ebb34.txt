Okay, so I've got this accounting problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my accounting, but I'll do my best.

Alright, the question is about converting from cash-basis to accrual-basis financial statements. Sussman Co. prepared cash-basis statements for January, and we need to find out by how much their income will increase when restated on an accrual basis.

Let me start by recalling the difference between cash and accrual basis. In cash basis, revenue is recognized when cash is received, and expenses when cash is paid. On the other hand, accrual basis recognizes revenue when earned, regardless of payment, and expenses when incurred, regardless of payment.

So the problem gives three activities in January:
1. Credit sales of $5,600.
2. Collections of $1,900 related to January credit sales.
3. Accrued salaries of $1,200.

I need to figure out how each of these affects the cash-basis income and then adjust to get the accrual-basis income.

First, under cash basis:
- Credit sales are $5,600, but since they're credit, the cash hasn't been received yet. So in cash basis, these sales wouldn't be recorded as revenue yet. Instead, only the collections are considered revenue. So cash basis revenue would be the $1,900 collected.
- Accrued salaries of $1,200. In cash basis, expenses are recorded when paid. Since the salaries are accrued but not paid, cash basis wouldn't recognize this expense. So the expense here is $0.

So cash basis income would be $1,900 (revenue) minus $0 (expenses) = $1,900.

Now, moving to accrual basis:
- Revenue is recognized when earned, so the $5,600 credit sales are recorded as revenue, regardless of collection. So revenue is $5,600.
- The accrued salaries of $1,200 are recognized as an expense when incurred, so that's $1,200 expense.

So accrual basis income is $5,600 - $1,200 = $4,400.

Wait, but the question is asking by how much the cash-basis income increases when restated to accrual. So the cash-basis was $1,900, and accrual is $4,400. The increase is $4,400 - $1,900 = $2,500.

Hmm, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the difference between the two methods.

Under cash basis: 
- Revenues: $1,900 (collections)
- Expenses: $0 (since salaries are accrued but not paid)
- So net income: $1,900.

Under accrual basis:
- Revenues: $5,600 (all credit sales)
- Expenses: $1,200 (accrued salaries)
- Net income: $4,400.

The increase is $4,400 - $1,900 = $2,500.

Looking at the options, option G is $2,500.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything else. Oh wait, the cash basis only includes the cash collections as revenue. So under cash basis, the $5,600 isn't counted as revenue yet. So when moving to accrual, we add that $5,600, but subtract the $1,200 expense.

Wait, no, the cash basis only counts the $1,900 as revenue, and the $5,600 is not counted. So in accrual, the revenue increases by $5,600 - $1,900 = $3,700, but then the expense is $1,200. So the net effect is $3,700 - $1,200 = $2,500.

Alternatively, the change in revenue from cash to accrual is $5,600 - $1,900 = $3,700 increase in revenue. Then, the expense is $1,200, which was not there before, so it's a $1,200 increase in expenses. So net effect is $3,700 - $1,200 = $2,500 increase in income.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer should be $2,500, which is option G.

To determine the increase in Sussman Co.'s cash-basis income when restated to the accrual basis, we analyze the given activities:

1. **Cash-Basis Financials**:
   - **Revenue**: Only the $1,900 collected from credit sales is recognized as revenue.
   - **Expenses**: Accrued salaries of $1,200 are not recognized since they are not paid.
   - **Net Income**: $1,900 (revenue) - $0 (expenses) = **$1,900**.

2. **Accrual-Basis Financials**:
   - **Revenue**: The full $5,600 of credit sales is recognized as revenue when earned, regardless of collection.
   - **Expenses**: The $1,200 of accrued salaries is recognized as an expense when incurred, regardless of payment.
   - **Net Income**: $5,600 (revenue) - $1,200 (expenses) = **$4,400**.

3. **Increase in Income**:
   - The difference between accrual-basis and cash-basis net income is $4,400 - $1,900 = **$2,500**.

Thus, Sussman Co.'s cash-basis income will increase by **$2,500** when restated to the accrual basis.

The correct answer is **G: $2,500**.
