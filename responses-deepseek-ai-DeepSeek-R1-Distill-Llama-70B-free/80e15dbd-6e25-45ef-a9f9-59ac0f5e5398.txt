Okay, so I have this problem where AlforsMotors is buying some cars, and I need to find out what they'll pay per car after a chain discount. Hmm, chain discounts... I remember that chain discounts are applied successively, one after another. So you take the first discount off the list price, then apply the second discount to the new amount, and so on.

The list price is $6,238.42, and the discounts are 11%, 4%, and 21%. Wait, so the chain is 11%, then 4%, then 21%? Or is it 11%, 4%, and then 21% added together? No, no, chain discounts are applied one after the other, each time reducing the price further.

Let me break it down step by step. First, I'll find the price after the first discount. The original price is $6,238.42. The first discount is 11%. So I'll calculate 11% of 6,238.42 and subtract that from the original price.

Wait, alternatively, since applying a discount is the same as multiplying by (1 - discount rate), maybe it's easier to multiply each step by the discount factor. So for 11%, the factor is 0.89 (because 1 - 0.11 = 0.89). Then 4% discount would be 0.96, and 21% discount would be 0.79.

So the calculation would be 6,238.42 * 0.89 * 0.96 * 0.79. Let me compute that.

Wait, let me do this step by step. First, 6,238.42 multiplied by 0.89. Let me calculate that:

6,238.42 * 0.89. Let me see, 6,238.42 * 0.8 is 4,990.736, and 6,238.42 * 0.09 is 561.4578. Adding those together: 4,990.736 + 561.4578 = 5,552.1938. So after the first discount, the price is approximately $5,552.19.

Next, apply the 4% discount. So multiply by 0.96. 5,552.1938 * 0.96. Hmm, let me compute that. 5,552.1938 * 0.96. Well, 5,552.1938 * 1 is 5,552.1938, minus 4% of that. 4% is 0.04, so 5,552.1938 * 0.04 = 221.087552. Subtracting that from 5,552.1938 gives 5,552.1938 - 221.087552 = 5,331.106248. So approximately $5,331.11 after the second discount.

Now, apply the 21% discount. Multiply by 0.79. 5,331.106248 * 0.79. Let me compute that. 5,331.106248 * 0.7 is 3,731.7743736, and 5,331.106248 * 0.09 is 479.79996212. Adding those together: 3,731.7743736 + 479.79996212 = 4,211.5743357. So approximately $4,211.57 after all discounts.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see option D is $4,210.78. That's really close. Maybe I should check my calculations again because sometimes rounding can cause small discrepancies.

Let me recalculate each step more precisely.

First step: 6,238.42 * 0.89.

6,238.42 * 0.89: Let's compute this accurately. 6,238.42 * 0.8 = 4,990.736, and 6,238.42 * 0.09 = 561.4578. Adding them gives 4,990.736 + 561.4578 = 5,552.1938. So that's correct.

Second step: 5,552.1938 * 0.96.

Let me compute 5,552.1938 * 0.96. Let's see, 5,552.1938 * 96 = ?

Wait, another approach: 0.96 is 1 - 0.04, so 5,552.1938 * 0.96 = 5,552.1938 - (5,552.1938*0.04).

Calculating 5,552.1938 * 0.04: 5,552.1938 * 0.04 = 221.087552. Subtracting this from 5,552.1938 gives 5,331.106248.

Third step: 5,331.106248 * 0.79.

Compute precisely:

5,331.106248 * 0.79.

Break it down into 0.7 and 0.09.

0.7 * 5,331.106248 = 3,731.7743736.

0.09 * 5,331.106248 = let's compute 5,331.106248 * 0.09.

5,331.106248 * 0.09 = 479.79996212.

Adding 3,731.7743736 + 479.79996212 = 4,211.5743357.

So the total is approximately $4,211.57. Looking at the options, option D is $4,210.78. The slight difference might be due to rounding at each step. Alternatively, perhaps the discounts are applied in a different order? Wait, the problem says the chain discount is 11%, 4%, and 21%. So the order is correct as I applied them.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have multiplied all the discount factors first before applying. Let me try that.

Compute the total discount factor: 0.89 * 0.96 * 0.79.

Let me compute this step by step.

0.89 * 0.96 = ?

0.89 * 0.96: 89 * 96. Let's compute 90*96=8640, minus 1*96=96, so 8640-96=8544. So 0.8544.

Then multiply by 0.79: 0.8544 * 0.79.

Compute 0.8544 * 0.7 = 0.597808.

0.8544 * 0.09 = 0.076896.

Adding them: 0.597808 + 0.076896 = 0.674704.

So the total discount factor is 0.674704.

Now, multiply the original price by this factor: 6,238.42 * 0.674704.

Compute 6,238.42 * 0.674704.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, 6,238.42 * 0.6 = 3,743.052.

6,238.42 * 0.07 = 436.689.

6,238.42 * 0.0047 = let's compute 6,238.42 * 0.004 = 24.95368 and 6,238.42 * 0.0007=4.367094. So total 24.95368 +4.367094 ≈ 29.32077.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 6,238.42 * 0.674704.

Alternatively, perhaps a calculator approach, but since I don't have one, I'll proceed carefully.

Wait, 6,238.42 * 0.674704.

Approximately, 6,238.42 * 0.674704.

Let me compute 6,238.42 * 0.6 = 3,743.052.

6,238.42 * 0.07 = 436.689.

6,238.42 * 0.004704 = let's compute 6,238.42 * 0.004 = 24.95368, and 6,238.42 * 0.000704 = approx 4.393 (since 6,238.42 *0.0007=4.367, and 6,238.42*0.000004=0.02495). So 4.367 +0.02495=4.39195. So total 24.95368 +4.39195≈29.3456.

So add all three parts:

3,743.052 + 436.689 = 4,179.741.

Plus 29.3456: 4,179.741 +29.3456=4,209.0866.

So approximately $4,209.09.

Wait, that's about $4,209.09. But earlier, step by step, I got $4,211.57. Hmm, there's a slight discrepancy. But the exact answer when done step by step is around $4,211.57, but when multiplying all factors first, it's approximately $4,209.09.

Wait, maybe I should use exact calculations without rounding until the end.

Let me try the first method again, keeping more decimal places.

First discount: 11% off.

6,238.42 * (1 - 0.11) = 6,238.42 * 0.89.

Compute 6,238.42 *0.89.

Compute 6,238.42 × 0.8 = 4,990.736.

6,238.42 × 0.09: Let's compute 6,238.42 × 0.1 = 623.842, then subtract 6,238.42 × 0.01 = 62.3842. So 623.842 - 62.3842 = 561.4578.

Adding to the 0.8 part: 4,990.736 + 561.4578 = 5,552.1938.

Second discount: 4% off.

5,552.1938 × 0.96.

Compute 5,552.1938 × 0.96:

= 5,552.1938 × (1 - 0.04) = 5,552.1938 - (5,552.1938 × 0.04).

Compute 5,552.1938 × 0.04: 221.087552.

Subtracting: 5,552.1938 - 221.087552 = 5,331.106248.

Third discount: 21% off.

5,331.106248 × 0.79.

Compute 5,331.106248 × 0.79.

0.79 = 0.7 + 0.09.

5,331.106248 × 0.7 = 3,731.7743736.

5,331.106248 × 0.09 = 479.79996212.

Adding: 3,731.7743736 + 479.79996212 = 4,211.5743357.

So about $4,211.57. But the options don't have this exact number.

Looking back at the options:

Option D: $4,210.78.

Option H: $4,582.14.

Hmm, perhaps I should check if the chain was applied in a different order. Wait, the question says the chain is 11%, 4%, and 21%. So that's the correct order.

Alternatively, perhaps the discounts are applied as a series of subtractions. Let me check if I made a mistake in the order.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the discounts in a different way. Let me try applying the discounts in a different order, but I don't think that's the case. The chain is 11, 4,21.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute each discount step more accurately.

Wait, perhaps using exact multiplication each time without rounding until the end.

Let me try the first step again.

6,238.42 ×0.89.

Compute 6,238.42 × 0.89.

I'll compute 6,238.42 ×89, then divide by 100.

6,238.42 ×89:

Compute 6,238.42 ×90 = 561,457.8.

Subtract 6,238.42 once: 561,457.8 - 6,238.42 = 555,219.38.

So 6,238.42 × 89 = 555,219.38.

Divide by 100: 5,552.1938. So same as before.

Second step: 5,552.1938 ×0.96.

Compute 5,552.1938 ×96, then divide by 100.

5,552.1938 ×96.

Let me compute 5,552.1938 ×100 = 555,219.38.

Subtract 5,552.1938 ×4 = 22,208.7752.

So 555,219.38 -22,208.7752 = 533,010.6048.

Divide by 100: 5,330.106048.

Wait, wait, 5,552.1938 ×0.96 = 5,330.106048.

Third step: 5,330.106048 ×0.79.

Compute 5,330.106048 ×79, then divide by 100.

5,330.106048 ×79.

Compute 5,330.106048 ×80 = 426,408,483.9 (wait, wait, no, wait, 5,330.106048 ×80 = 426,408.4839? Wait, no, 5,330.106048 ×80 is 5,330.106048 ×8 ×10.

Wait, 5,330.106048 ×8 = 42,640.848384. Multiply by 10: 426,408.48384.

Wait, but 79 is 80 -1, so 5,330.106048 ×79 = 5,330.106048 ×80 -5,330.106048.

So 426,408.48384 -5,330.106048 = 421,078.3778.

Divide by 100: 4,210.783778.

So approximately $4,210.78, which matches option D.

Ah, so earlier when I did step by step, I had a slight error in the second step perhaps, but calculating this way, the exact amount is $4,210.78. So the correct answer is option D.

To determine the price AlforsMotors will pay for each car after applying the chain discount of 11%, 4%, and 21%, we calculate the discounts successively. The list price of the car is $6,238.42. Chain discounts are applied by multiplying the price by the complement of each discount rate in sequence.

1. **First discount (11%):**  
   The complement of 11% is \( 1 - 0.11 = 0.89 \).  
   \[
   6,238.42 \times 0.89 = 5,552.1938
   \]

2. **Second discount (4%):**  
   The complement of 4% is \( 1 - 0.04 = 0.96 \).  
   \[
   5,552.1938 \times 0.96 = 5,331.106248
   \]

3. **Third discount (21%):**  
   The complement of 21% is \( 1 - 0.21 = 0.79 \).  
   \[
   5,331.106248 \times 0.79 = 4,210.783778
   \]

After applying all discounts, the final price AlforsMotors will pay for each car is approximately **$4,210.78**. This matches option **D**.

**Answer: D**
