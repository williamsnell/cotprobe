Okay, so I'm trying to solve this probability problem. The question is asking me to compute P(1.7 ≤ Y ≤ 3.2) where Y is probably the sample mean, given n=4. I remember from my studies that when dealing with the distribution of the sample mean, if the original data follows a normal distribution, then the sample mean also follows a normal distribution. But wait, the problem also mentions comparing it with the normal approximation, so maybe the original distribution isn't normal? Hmm, I'm a bit confused there.

Wait, in Example 5.6-4, which this question references, I think Y was the sample mean of four independent uniform (0,1) random variables. Oh right, uniform distribution on (0,1). So the Central Limit Theorem comes into play here. Since n=4 is a small sample size, the normal approximation might not be perfect, but let's see.

First, I need to compute the exact probability P(1.7 ≤ Y ≤ 3.2). Y is the sample mean of four uniform variables. The distribution of the sample mean when the population is uniform is something I need to recall. I think the distribution of the sum of uniform variables is called the Irwin–Hall distribution, and then the sample mean would just be that sum divided by n.

So for four variables, the sum S = Y * 4 would follow the Irwin–Hall distribution with parameter 4. The PDF for Irwin–Hall is a piecewise function consisting of sections of a polynomial. For S, the PDF f_S(s) is given by:

f_S(s) = (1/6) * (s^3 - 3s^2 + 3s) for 0 ≤ s ≤ 1,

f_S(s) = (1/6) * (-s^3 + 9s^2 - 27s + 27) for 1 ≤ s ≤ 2,

f_S(s) = (1/6) * (s^3 - 15s^2 + 45s -45) for 2 ≤ s ≤ 3,

and f_S(s) = (1/6) * (s^3 - 12s^2 + 48s -64) for 3 ≤ s ≤ 4.

Wait, no, maybe I got the coefficients wrong. Alternatively, I remember that the PDF for the sum of n uniform variables can be found by convolution, but it's a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the CDF instead, which might be easier for integrating.

The CDF for the Irwin–Hall distribution is known, so maybe I can find P(S ≤ s) and then adjust for the sample mean by considering s = Y * 4.

So, for Y between 1.7 and 3.2, S would be between 6.8 and 12.8. But wait, that can't be right because the maximum possible sum of four uniform (0,1) variables is 4*1=4. So 3.2 *4 is 12.8, which is way beyond 4. Oh wait, that's not possible. So probably I made a mistake here.

Wait a minute, no. If each X_i is uniform on (0,1), then each X_i ranges from 0 to 1. So the sum S = X1 + X2 + X3 + X4 ranges from 0 to 4. Therefore, the sample mean Y = S/4 would range from 0 to 1. So how can the question ask about Y being between 1.7 and 3.2? That can't happen because Y can't be more than 1. Did I misunderstand the problem?

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe in the example, the uniform variables are on a different interval. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps the original variables are uniform on (0, θ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem was about exponential distributions or something else, but no, I'm pretty sure it was uniform. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the examples.

Let me go back. In Example 5.6-4, Y is the sample mean of four independent uniform (0,1) variables. So Y ranges from 0 to 1. So the probability that Y is between 1.7 and 3.2 is zero because Y can't be more than 1. That can't be right. So perhaps the numbers in the question are wrong, or I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the original variables are not (0,1) but something else. Maybe uniform (a, b) with a different a and b. But since the problem doesn't specify, I have to assume that it's (0,1). So in that case, P(1.7 ≤ Y ≤3.2) is zero. But none of the answer options are zero. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about a different distribution. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe it's a different example. Oh wait, perhaps in the example, Y is the sum, not the mean. That would make more sense. Let me check. If Y is the sum, then Y ranges from 0 to 4. So 1.7 ≤ Y ≤3.2 would be possible. Then, the sample mean would be Y/4, but the way the question is phrased, it's P(1.7 ≤ Y ≤3.2). So perhaps Y is the sum, not the mean. Alternatively, maybe the question is correct, and Y is the mean. But that would make the interval impossible, leading to zero probability. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the variables are not on (0,1) but on (0,4), which would make the sum up to 16, and the mean up to 4. But that's just speculation. Since the question references Example 5.6-4, I need to recall what that example was about.

Wait, I think in Example 5.6-4, the problem was about the sample mean of four uniform (0,1) variables, so Y would be between 0 and 1. So the probability that Y is between 1.7 and 3.2 is zero, which doesn't match any of the options. So I must have made a mistake in interpreting the question.

Wait, perhaps the variables are exponential. If that's the case, then the sum of four exponential variables follows a gamma distribution, and the mean would be gamma divided by 4. But again, if the mean is of exponentials, it's a different story. But the question is about the normal approximation, so perhaps it's using the CLT regardless.

Wait, perhaps the question is correct, but I'm missing something. Let me try to approach this step by step.

Assuming Y is the sample mean of four independent uniform (0,1) variables. So Y has a range of 0 to 1. So the probability that Y is between 1.7 and 3.2 is zero. But the given options don't include zero, so I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the variables are uniform on (0,4) instead of (0,1). That would make Y range up to 4, so the mean would be up to 4, and 3.2 would be possible. But that's just a guess.

Wait, another thought: maybe the question is using Y as the sum, not the mean. So if Y is the sum of four uniform (0,1) variables, then Y ranges from 0 to 4, and 1.7 ≤ Y ≤3.2 is possible.

In that case, the exact probability can be found using the Irwin–Hall distribution's CDF.

The CDF for the sum of four uniform variables is given by:

For 0 ≤ y ≤ 1:

F_Y(y) = y^4 / 24.

For 1 ≤ y ≤ 2:

F_Y(y) = (y^4 - 4(y-1)^4)/24.

Wait, no, I think the CDF is a bit more involved. Alternatively, the CDF can be constructed by considering different intervals. Let me try to remember the formula correctly.

The general formula for the CDF of the sum of n uniform (0,1) variables is:

F_S(s) = (1/n!) * Σ_{k=0}^{floor(s)} (-1)^k * C(n, k) * (s - k)^n

But I'm not sure about the exact expression. Alternatively, for n=4, the CDF is a piecewise function with different expressions in different intervals.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the exact probability by integrating the PDF.

The PDF for the sum of four uniform variables is:

For 0 ≤ s ≤1:

f_S(s) = s^3 / 6.

For 1 ≤ s ≤2:

f_S(s) = (-2s^3 + 6s^2 - 6s + 4)/6.

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the CDF.

Wait, another approach: the CDF of the sum S of four uniform variables is given by:

F_S(s) = (s^4)/24 for 0 ≤ s ≤1,

F_S(s) = (s^4 - 4*(s-1)^4)/24 for 1 ≤ s ≤2,

F_S(s) = (s^4 - 4*(s-1)^4 + 6*(s-2)^4)/24 for 2 ≤ s ≤3,

F_S(s) = (s^4 - 4*(s-1)^4 + 6*(s-2)^4 -4*(s-3)^4)/24 for 3 ≤ s ≤4.

Wait, I'm not entirely confident about these coefficients, but let's proceed with this.

So, to find P(1.7 ≤ S ≤3.2), we can compute F_S(3.2) - F_S(1.7).

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute F_S(3.2):

Since 3 ≤3.2 ≤4, we use the formula:

F_S(s) = (s^4 -4*(s-1)^4 +6*(s-2)^4 -4*(s-3)^4)/24.

So plugging s=3.2:

Compute each term:

s^4 = (3.2)^4 = let's compute 3.2 squared first: 3.2*3.2=10.24. Then squared again: 10.24^2=104.8576.

(s-1)^4 = (2.2)^4. 2.2^2=4.84, then 4.84^2=23.4256.

(s-2)^4 = (1.2)^4. 1.2^2=1.44, then 1.44^2=2.0736.

(s-3)^4 = (0.2)^4=0.0016.

Now plug into the formula:

F_S(3.2) = [104.8576 -4*(23.4256) +6*(2.0736) -4*(0.0016)] /24.

Compute each term:

-4*(23.4256) = -93.7024.

6*(2.0736)=12.4416.

-4*(0.0016)= -0.0064.

So adding all terms:

104.8576 -93.7024 = 11.1552.

11.1552 +12.4416 =23.5968.

23.5968 -0.0064=23.5904.

Divide by24: 23.5904 /24 ≈0.9816.

Wait, that can't be right because at s=4, F_S(s)=1. So 3.2 is close to 4, so F_S(3.2)≈0.98 is plausible.

Now compute F_S(1.7):

1.7 is between 1 and 2, so we use the formula for 1 ≤s ≤2:

F_S(s) = (s^4 -4*(s-1)^4)/24.

Compute each term:

s=1.7 → s^4= (1.7)^4.

1.7^2=2.89; 2.89^2≈8.3521.

(s-1)=0.7 → (0.7)^4=0.7*0.7=0.49; 0.49^2=0.2401.

So F_S(1.7)= [8.3521 -4*(0.2401)] /24.

Compute 4*(0.2401)=0.9604.

So numerator: 8.3521 -0.9604 =7.3917.

Divide by24: 7.3917/24≈0.3080.

So F_S(1.7)=≈0.3080.

Therefore, P(1.7 ≤S ≤3.2)= F_S(3.2) - F_S(1.7)= 0.9816 -0.3080≈0.6736.

Wait, but Y is the sample mean, which is S/4. So the original question is about Y between 1.7 and 3.2, which would correspond to S between 6.8 and 12.8. But wait, earlier I thought S can only go up to4, so this would imply P=0. But that contradicts the previous calculation. So I think I must have mixed up S and Y.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify. The problem is about Y, the sample mean, and the interval is 1.7 ≤ Y ≤3.2. But if Y is the sample mean of four uniform (0,1) variables, Y can't be more than 1, as each X_i is at most 1. So this interval is impossible, making the probability zero. But that can't be, as the options don't include zero. So perhaps the variables are not uniform (0,1). Alternatively, perhaps Y is the sum, not the mean. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different distribution. Let me think. Maybe the variables are exponential with mean 1, but that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, perhaps the question is correct, and Y is the sample mean, but the variables are from a different distribution. Let's try to approach it differently.

Assuming that Y is the sample mean of four independent random variables, each with some distribution. The problem is to compute P(1.7 ≤ Y ≤3.2) and compare it to the normal approximation.

If the exact distribution is needed, perhaps it's better to use the normal approximation directly. But wait, the exact distribution would depend on the original variables' distribution. Since the original problem refers to Example 5.6-4, which I think is about uniform (0,1) variables, but then the sample mean can't be beyond 1, so there must be a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the sum, Y, of four uniform (0,1) variables, so Y ranges from 0 to4. Then P(1.7 ≤ Y ≤3.2) would be F_Y(3.2) - F_Y(1.7), which I calculated earlier as approximately 0.6736, which is around 0.674, which is option B (0.6749). But wait, let me check the exact value.

Wait, in my earlier calculation, I found F_S(3.2)=≈0.9816 and F_S(1.7)=≈0.3080. So the difference is 0.9816 - 0.3080=0.6736, which is approximately 0.674. Looking at the options, option B is 0.6749, which is very close.

But wait, that's the exact probability for the sum S. However, the question is about Y, which is the sample mean. So if Y is the sample mean, then Y = S/4. So the interval 1.7 ≤ Y ≤3.2 corresponds to 6.8 ≤ S ≤12.8. But since S can only be up to4, this interval is impossible, so P=0.

This is confusing. There's a contradiction here. Either the question is about the sum, and the exact probability is around 0.674, which is option B, or it's about the mean, which would have P=0, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem as the sum. Let me check the question again: it says compute P(1.7 ≤ Y ≤3.2) with n=4. So Y is the sample mean. But as Y can't exceed 1, the probability is zero, which is not among the options. So perhaps the variables are not (0,1) but something else, like (0,4), making Y's maximum 4/4=1, which is still 1. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the original variables are exponential with λ=1, so the sum of four exponentials would have a gamma distribution with shape 4 and rate 1. The sample mean would then have a gamma distribution scaled by 1/4. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the variables are normal, but that's unlikely since the question is about normal approximation.

Wait, going back to the example 5.6-4, which I think is about uniform (0,1) variables, and the sample mean Y. The exact distribution would be the Irwin-Hall for the sum, so for Y, it's the same as S/4.

So, the sample mean Y would have the PDF f_Y(y) = 4 * f_S(4y), because if S =4Y, then the transformation applies. So for 0 ≤ y ≤1, f_Y(y) =4 * f_S(4y).

But when calculating P(1.7 ≤ Y ≤3.2), since Y can't be more than1, this probability is zero. So again, I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is misprinted, and the interval is 0.17 ≤ Y ≤0.32. That would make sense for the sample mean of uniform (0,1). But the question says 1.7 to3.2, which is impossible.

Wait, perhaps the variables are uniform on (0,4), so each X_i can go up to4, making the sample mean up to4. Then Y could be up to4, and the interval 1.7 to3.2 would be valid. But the example I'm thinking of is about (0,1), so this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is correct, and the variables are from a different distribution. Maybe they are normal with some mean and variance, and the exact distribution is
