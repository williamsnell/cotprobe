Okay, so I've got this problem about an alternator, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me take it step by step.

First, the problem says it's a 1000 kVA, 4600 V, three-phase, wye-connected alternator. Armature resistance is 2 ohms per phase, and the synchronous armature reactance X_s is 20 ohms per phase. I need to find the full-load generated voltage per phase for different power factors.

I remember that in alternators, the generated voltage (E) is different from the terminal voltage (V) because of the voltage drop in the armature. The terminal voltage is given as 4600 V, but that's probably the line voltage since it's wye-connected. So for a wye connection, the phase voltage would be V_phase = V_line / sqrt(3). Let me calculate that. 4600 divided by sqrt(3) is approximately 2656.6 volts per phase. Wait, the question asks for the generated voltage, which is E, so E is higher than V because of the drop.

The formula I think is E = V + I*(R) + I*(X_s)*j, but since this is phasor quantities, I might need to calculate the magnitude. Alternatively, using the voltage equation for an alternator under load: E^2 = V^2 + (I R)^2 + (I X_s)^2 ± I R I X_s, but wait, no, I think it's E² = V² + I²(R² + X_s²) ± 2 V I R cos(theta) + 2 V I X_s sin(theta). Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

Oh right, the generated voltage E per phase can be found using the equation considering the terminal voltage V, the current I, and the power factor. The formula is E = V + I (R cosθ + X_s sinθ), where θ is the power factor angle. Since power factor PF = cosθ, and for lagging PF, θ is positive, while for leading, it's negative.

But wait, the power factor could be leading or lagging, so the angle would be adjusted accordingly. So I need to compute E for each case.

First, I need to find the full-load current. The alternator is rated 1000 kVA, so 1000 kVA is 1,000,000 VA. For a three-phase system, the line current I = VA / (√3 * V_line). So I = 1e6 / (√3 * 4600). Let me compute that.

√3 is about 1.732. So denominator is 1.732 * 4600 ≈ 7972. So I ≈ 1e6 / 7972 ≈ 125.44 A. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Wait, 1e6 divided by 7972 is about 125.5 A. Hmm, but wait the terminal voltage is 4600 V line, so each phase's voltage is 4600 / sqrt(3) ≈ 2656.6 V. So the current per phase is I = 1e6 VA / (√3 * 4600) = 1e6 / (4600 * 1.732) ≈ 1e6 / 7972 ≈ 125.44 A.

Wait, no, that's the line current. For a wye connection, the phase current is the same as the line current, right? Because in wye, each phase has the same current as the line. So I is 125.44 A per phase.

Wait, no, no. For a three-phase system, the line current is the same as the phase current in a wye connection? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. In a wye (Y) connection, each phase is connected between a line and neutral. So the line current is the same as the phase current because there's no delta connection involved. So for a Y-connected load, I_line = I_phase. So yes, I_phase is 125.44 A.

Now, for part (i)(a): Unity power factor. So PF = 1, which means cosθ = 1, sinθ = 0. So the angle θ is 0 degrees. So the generated voltage E per phase is V + I(R cosθ + X_s sinθ). Wait, but wait: the terminal voltage V is 4600 V line, so 2656.6 V per phase. So E_phase = V_phase + I*(R cosθ + X_s sinθ).

At unity PF, cosθ = 1, sinθ = 0. So E = V_phase + I*(R*1 + X_s*0) = V_phase + I R. So I is 125.44 A, R is 2 ohms. So I R = 125.44 * 2 = 250.88 volts. So E = 2656.6 + 250.88 ≈ 2907.48 V per phase? Wait, but looking at the options, they don't have this. Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake.

Wait, wait, wait. I think I might have confused the formula. Let me check the correct voltage equation. The correct formula for the generated voltage E is given by E = V + j I X_s + I R. But since it's a phasor, the magnitude would be sqrt( (V cosθ + I R)^2 + (V sinθ + I X_s)^2 ). Alternatively, maybe it's better to use E² = (V cosθ + I R)^2 + (V sinθ + I X_s)^2.

Wait, actually, the correct expression is E^2 = (V cosθ + I R)^2 + (V sinθ + I X_s)^2. Because the generated voltage E leads V by the angle delta, considering the armature reaction. So when the load has a power factor angle θ, the terminal voltage V is the generated voltage E minus the voltage drops I R and I X_s. So maybe the formula should be E = V + I (R cosθ + X_s sinθ) + j I (X_s cosθ - R sinθ). But since we're only interested in the magnitude, E^2 = [V cosθ + I R]^2 + [V sinθ + I X_s]^2.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. Oh, I think I should model it using the phasor diagram approach. The generated voltage E is the phasor sum of the terminal voltage V and the voltage drop in the armature, which is I (R + j X_s). So E = V + I (R + j X_s). But since the current I has a phase angle relative to V depending on the PF. Wait, no, because the PF is determined by the load. So I think it's better to express I in terms of its components relative to V.

Wait, if the load has a power factor of cosθ, then the current I lags V by θ when the PF is lagging, and leads when PF is leading. So in the phasor diagram, the current I can be represented as I = I (cosθ - j sinθ) when PF is lagging, but wait, that's for the impedance. Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently.

Alternatively, using the voltage equation: E = V + I_r + j I_x, where I_r and I_x are the components of the current I multiplied by R and X_s respectively.

But perhaps a better approach is to compute E using the formula:

E = sqrt( (V cosθ + I R)^2 + (V sinθ + I X_s)^2 )

So for each case, I'll plug in the values.

Let's compute part (i)(a): Unity PF.

θ = 0 degrees.

So cosθ = 1, sinθ = 0.

E = sqrt( (2656.6 * 1 + 125.44 * 2 )^2 + (2656.6 * 0 + 125.44 * 20 )^2 )

Compute each term:

First term inside sqrt: (2656.6 + 250.88) = 2907.48. So square is (2907.48)^2 ≈ 8,457,000.

Second term: (0 + 2508.8) = 2508.8. Square is approx (2508.8)^2 ≈ 6,290,000.

So E^2 = 8,457,000 + 6,290,000 ≈ 14,747,000.

E ≈ sqrt(14,747,000) ≈ 3840 V. Hmm, but none of the options have exactly this value. Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the current. Let me recalculate I.

The alternator is 1000 kVA, which is 1,000,000 VA. For a three-phase system, the line current is I = VA / (√3 * V_line). So 1e6 / (sqrt(3)*4600) = 1e6 / (1.732 * 4600) ≈ 1e6 / 7972 ≈ 125.44 A. So that's correct.

Now, V_phase is 4600 / sqrt(3) ≈ 2656.6 V.

So for part (i)(a), E ≈ sqrt( (2656.6 + 125.44*2)^2 + (0 + 125.44*20)^2 )

Wait, 125.44*2 is 250.88, so 2656.6 + 250.88 = 2907.48.

125.44 * 20 = 2508.8.

So E^2 = (2907.48)^2 + (2508.8)^2.

Compute 2907.48 squared: approx 2907^2 is about 8,448,000 (since 2900^2 is 8,410,000, and 7.48^2 is small). Similarly, 2508.8 squared is about 6,290,000.

So E^2 = 8,448,000 + 6,290,000 ≈ 14,738,000.

E ≈ sqrt(14,738,000) ≈ 3840 V. Hmm, looking at the options, option C for part (a) is 3845 V, which is very close. So that's probably the correct choice.

Wait, but wait. Another way: the per unit method. But perhaps that's complicating it. Alternatively, maybe my calculation is correct, and the option is C.

Now, part (i)(b): Power factor 0.75 lagging. So θ is arccos(0.75) ≈ 41.4 degrees. So cosθ = 0.75, sinθ = 0.6614 (since sin(41.4) is approx 0.6614).

So E = sqrt( (2656.6 * 0.75 + 125.44 * 2 )^2 + (2656.6 * 0.6614 + 125.44 * 20 )^2 )

Compute each term:

First term inside: (2656.6 * 0.75) = 1992.45; 125.44 * 2 = 250.88. So 1992.45 + 250.88 = 2243.33.

Second term: 2656.6 * 0.6614 ≈ 2656.6 * 0.66 ≈ 1754. So more accurately, 2656.6 * 0.6614 ≈ 2656.6 * (2/3) is about 1771, but 0.6614 is a bit less than 2/3 (0.6667). So maybe 1754? Let's compute it precisely: 2656.6 * 0.6614.

2656.6 * 0.6 = 1593.96
2656.6 * 0.06 = 159.396
2656.6 * 0.0014 = approx 3.72
Total ≈ 1593.96 + 159.396 = 1753.356 +3.72 ≈ 1757.076.

Then, 125.44 *20 = 2508.8.

So 1757.076 + 2508.8 = 4265.876.

So E^2 = (2243.33)^2 + (4265.88)^2.

Compute each square:

2243.33^2 ≈ (2200)^2 = 4,840,000, plus (43.33)^2 ≈ 1875, so total ≈ 4,841,875.

4265.88^2 ≈ (4266)^2. Let's compute 4266^2:

I know that 4000^2 = 16,000,000; 266^2 = 70,756; cross term 2*4000*266 = 2,128,000. So (4000+266)^2 = 4000^2 + 2*4000*266 +266^2 = 16,000,000 + 2,128,000 + 70,756 = 18,198,756. So approximately 18,198,756.

So E^2 ≈ 4,841,875 + 18,198,756 ≈ 23,040,631. So E ≈ sqrt(23,040,631) ≈ 4802 V. Wait, but looking at the options, option C's (i)(b) is 4820 V. So that's very close. So probably correct.

Wait, but I might have made a mistake in the calculation because 4802 isn't exactly 4820, but perhaps due to rounding during calculations. So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Now, moving to part (ii), which is to find the generated voltage for leading power factors.

Part (ii)(a): Leading PF of 0.75. So θ is negative, cosθ=0.75, sinθ=-0.6614.

So E = sqrt( (V cosθ + I R)^2 + (V sinθ + I X_s)^2 )

Plugging in the values:

V cosθ = 2656.6 * 0.75 = 1992.45

I R = 125.44 *2 = 250.88

So first term: 1992.45 + 250.88 = 2243.33

Second term: V sinθ = 2656.6 * (-0.6614) ≈ -1757.076

I X_s = 125.44 *20 = 2508.8

So second term: -1757.076 + 2508.8 ≈ 751.724

So E^2 = (2243.33)^2 + (751.724)^2

Compute:

2243.33^2 ≈ 5,030,000 (exactly, 2243.33^2 is (2243.33)^2 = let me compute 2243^2: 2243 *2243. Wait, 2200^2=4,840,000, 43^2=1849, cross term 2*2200*43= 2*2200=4400*43= 189,200. So 4,840,000 + 189,200 = 5,029,200 + 43^2=5,029,200+1849=5,031,049. So approximately 5,031,049.

(751.724)^2 ≈ 565,000 (since 750^2=562,500; 1.724^2≈3, so 750^2 + 2*750*1.724 +1.724^2 ≈ 562,500 + 2586 +3 ≈ 565,089.

So E^2 ≈ 5,031,049 + 565,089 = 5,596,138.

E ≈ sqrt(5,596,138) ≈ 2366 V. Looking at the options, option C's (ii)(a) is 2360 V, which is close. So that's probably correct.

Part (ii)(b): Leading PF of 0.4. So cosθ=0.4, sinθ= -0.9165 (since sin(arccos(0.4))=sqrt(1-0.16)=0.9165, but negative because leading).

So compute the terms:

V cosθ = 2656.6 *0.4 ≈ 1062.64

I R = 125.44 *2 = 250.88

First term: 1062.64 + 250.88 = 1313.52

V sinθ = 2656.6 * (-0.9165) ≈ -2434.0

I X_s = 125.44 *20 = 2508.8

Second term: (-2434.0) + 2508.8 ≈ 74.8

So E^2 = (1313.52)^2 + (74.8)^2

Compute each:

1313.52^2 ≈ (1300)^2 = 1,690,000, 13.52^2≈183, cross term 2*1300*13.52= 35,272. So total ≈ 1,690,000 + 35,272 + 183 ≈ 1,725,455.

74.8^2 ≈ 5,600.

So E^2 ≈ 1,725,455 + 5,600 = 1,731,055.

E ≈ sqrt(1,731,055) ≈ 1315 V. Looking at the options, option C's (ii)(b) is 1315 V. So that matches.

Putting it all together, the answers for each part are:

(i)(a): ~3845 V → option C

(i)(b): ~4820 V → option C

(ii)(a): ~2360 V → option C

(ii)(b): ~1315 V → option C

So the correct option is C.

To solve the problem, we calculate the generated voltage per phase for the given conditions using the formula:

\[
E = \sqrt{(V \cos\theta + I R)^2 + (V \sin\theta + I X_s)^2}
\]

where:
- \(V\) is the terminal voltage per phase,
- \(I\) is the full-load current,
- \(R = 2 \, \Omega\) is the armature resistance per phase,
- \(X_s = 20 \, \Omega\) is the synchronous reactance per phase,
- \(\cos\theta\) and \(\sin\theta\) depend on the power factor (PF).

### Step 1: Calculate the full-load current
