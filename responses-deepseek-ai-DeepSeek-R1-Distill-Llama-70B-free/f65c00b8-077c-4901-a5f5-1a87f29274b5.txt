Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about food security, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by recalling what I know about food security.

From what I remember, food security isn't just about having enough food available. It's more comprehensive than that. I think it involves several components. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations defines food security, right? I think they mention four main dimensions: availability, access, utilization, and stability.

So, looking at the options, I need to find the one that includes these elements. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A says it's about controlling food prices to make them affordable. That sounds like part of access, but food security is more than just affordability. So A might not be the full picture.

Option B relates to preventing terrorists from poisoning food. That's more about food safety or security in terms of protection from tampering, not the broader concept of food security. So B isn't right.

Option C mentions availability, utilization, and stability, as well as access. Wait, that's exactly the four components I was thinking of. Availability refers to having enough food, access is about people being able to get it, utilization is using it properly (like nutritionally), and stability means it's consistently available over time. So C seems correct.

Option D talks about genetically modified crops to increase yield. That's a method to potentially improve food security, but it's not the definition. So D is more of a strategy than the definition.

Option E is about protecting food from natural disasters. That's part of stability, but again, not the whole definition. So E isn't the answer.

Option F says it's ensuring everyone's access to food. Access is one component, but the full definition includes more aspects. So F is incomplete.

Option G is about preserving food to prevent spoilage. That's more related to food storage and waste reduction, which is important but not the definition of food security.

Option H focuses on ending micronutrient malnutrition. That's part of utilization, ensuring that the food is nutritious. But again, it's just one part of the bigger picture.

Option I is about producing enough food for a country. That's availability, another component, but not the full definition.

Option J refers to protecting agricultural land. That's related to sustainability and availability but not the entire concept.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be option C because it includes all four elements: availability, access, utilization, and stability.

The correct answer is option C because it encompasses all four key components of food security: availability, access, utilization, and stability. These elements ensure that food is not only present but also accessible, properly used, and consistently available over time.

Answer: C
