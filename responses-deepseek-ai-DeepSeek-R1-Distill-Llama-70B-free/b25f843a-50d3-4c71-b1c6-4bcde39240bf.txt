Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read it carefully.

The question is asking about naturalists who focused on natural elements and processes. The options are A through J, each representing different philosophies or schools of thought.

Hmm, naturalists... I think naturalism is about focusing on the natural world, right? So which of these options are associated with that?

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Mengzi. I remember Mengzi, also known as Mencius, was a Confucian philosopher. He talked a lot about human nature and ethics, so probably not the one focused on natural elements.

Option B: Zoroastrianism. That's an ancient Persian religion, focusing on a supreme god and dualism between good and evil. Not sure about their focus on natural processes, but maybe not the best fit here.

Option C: Zen Buddhism. Zen is more about meditation and the mind, seeking enlightenment through intuition rather than scripture. Doesn't strike me as particularly focused on natural elements in the way the question suggests.

Option D: Shintoism. Shinto is the indigenous religion of Japan, emphasizing rituals and a connection to nature. It does involve natural elements like trees, mountains, and spirits (kami) in nature. So this could be a candidate.

Option E: Vedic Philosophy. Vedic is related to Hinduism, the Vedas. It's more about rituals, deities, and the cosmos. While it does involve natural elements, I'm not sure if it's the naturalistic approach the question refers to.

Option F: Humanistic Buddhism. That's a modern interpretation focusing on applying Buddhist teachings to daily life and society. Not particularly about natural elements.

Option G: Confucianism. Confucius taught about ethics, morality, and proper social behavior. Not really centered on natural processes.

Option H: Legalism. This was a Chinese philosophy that emphasized strict laws and governance. Doesn't relate to natural elements.

Option I: Yin-Yang School. Yin-Yang is part of ancient Chinese philosophy, associated with the Taiji symbol. It's about the harmony of opposites in nature. So this definitely deals with natural processes and elements.

Option J: Daoism. Daoism, or Taoism, is all about living in harmony with the Dao, the natural order of the universe. It emphasizes wu-wei, which is non-action, going with the flow of nature. So this is a strong candidate.

Wait, the question is about naturalists. So which one is more about studying natural elements and processes. Daoism definitely focuses on nature and living in accordance with it. The Yin-Yang School is also about natural harmony, so both I and J could be contenders.

But the question asks which is associated with naturalists. I think Daoism is more explicitly about naturalism because it's centered around aligning with the natural world. Yin-Yang is a part of Daoist thought as well, but perhaps the broader category is Daoism.

So considering all that, the answer should be either I or J. But let me think again. The Yin-Yang School is a specific school within Chinese thought, often considered part of Daoism. But the question is about naturalists, so maybe the broader category is Daoism.

Alternatively, the question might be referring to the Yin-Yang School because it's specifically about the natural elements and their interactions, like the five elements theory. Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recall: the Yin-Yang School is more about the principles of opposites and how they interact in the natural world. So they do focus on natural elements and processes.

But then again, Daoism is all about the Dao, which is the ultimate natural principle. So both could be possible, but the question is asking which is associated with naturalists.

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but I think the answer is either I or J. Wait, looking back, the question says "naturalists who concentrated on natural elements and processes." So perhaps the Yin-Yang School is more about that. Or maybe it's Daoism.

Wait, another approach: looking at the options, I think the correct answer is J: Daoism. Because Daoism is well-known for its emphasis on nature and natural processes. The Yin-Yang School is more about the concepts of yin and yang, which are part of Daoist thought but also used in other contexts like Confucianism.

So I think the answer is J: Daoism.

The question asks which philosophy is associated with naturalists who focused on natural elements and processes. After analyzing the options:

- **Mengzi (A)** and **Confucianism (G)** focus on ethics and social behavior, not natural elements.
- **Zoroastrianism (B)** and **Vedic Philosophy (E)** are religious traditions with some connection to nature but not primarily naturalistic.
- **Zen Buddhism (C)** and **Humanistic Buddhism (F)** emphasize meditation and societal application, respectively, not natural processes.
- **Shintoism (D)** involves nature spirits but is more ritualistic than naturalistic.
- **Legalism (H)** is about governance and laws, unrelated to natural elements.
- **Yin-Yang School (I)** focuses on natural harmony and opposites, making it a strong candidate.
- **Daoism (J)** is centered on the Dao, emphasizing living in harmony with nature, making it the best fit.

While both **I (Yin-Yang School)** and **J (Daoism)** involve natural elements, Daoism is more explicitly associated with naturalism due to its broader emphasis on aligning with the natural world. Therefore, the answer is:

J
