Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about Critical Security Studies and the referent object of security. Hmm, I remember that in security studies, the referent object is the thing or entity that is being secured. Traditional views often focus on the state, right? Like, national security is about protecting the state's interests, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.

But wait, the question is about Critical Security Studies (CSS). From what I've read, CSS challenges the traditional state-centric approach. I think CSS argues that the referent shouldn't just be the state. Instead, they emphasize the importance of people, individuals, or human security. So the focus shifts from the state to the human level.

Let me think of some key scholars. The Copenhagen School comes to mind, but I'm not sure if they're part of CSS or more of a constructivist approach. Oh right, CSS is more about broadening and deepening security beyond the state. They include things like economic, environmental, and social aspects, but the referent object is still the people rather than the state.

So looking at the options, option B says "The people and their collectives." That sounds right because CSS prioritizes human security. Option J is about the state and state apparatus, which is the traditional view, not CSS. Option E says there's no specific referent, but I think CSS does have a referent, just not the state.

Other options like environment (F) or non-state actors (H) are more about different dimensions or threats rather than the referent object. So the answer should be B.

The referent object of security in Critical Security Studies is the people and their collectives, as it emphasizes human security over traditional state-centric approaches.
