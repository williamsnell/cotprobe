Question:

A relevant fact in a plaintiff's suit is the magnitude of an explosion at an oil refinery one evening. At trial, the plaintiff was asked on direct examination if he remembered the explosion. He replied, "I recall my son running into the home and screaming that the car windows just shattered. " The son was available to testify at trial. The defendant's attorney makes a motion to strike the plaintiff's answer. The trial judge should rule the plaintiff's testimony

Options:

A: admissible, because the son is available as a witness.
B: admissible, if the son's testimony corroborates the plaintiff's statement.
C: inadmissible, because the statement can be considered secondhand information.
D: admissible, because it gives context to the magnitude of the explosion.
E: inadmissible under the excited utterance exception, because it can be a product of reflection and deliberation.
F: admissible, because it provides relevant details about the incident.
G: admissible, whether or not the son is available as a witness.
H: inadmissible, because the plaintiff's statement is based on the son's account.
I: inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.
J: inadmissible, unless the son's account is presented as evidence.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence question. Let's see what it's about. The scenario is a trial where the plaintiff is testifying about an explosion at an oil refinery. The plaintiff was asked if he remembered the explosion and he replied by recounting his son running in and saying the car windows shattered. Now, the defendant's attorney is moving to strike that testimony, and we need to determine if the trial judge should allow it or not.

Hmm, the key here is to identify what kind of evidence this is and whether it's admissible. The plaintiff's statement includes something his son said. So the son's statement is being offered through the plaintiff's testimony. The son is available to testify, which is an important point.

Wait, so when someone testifies about what another person said, that's hearsay, right? Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Here, the son's statement is being used to show that the explosion was big enough to shatter windows, which is relevant to the case's facts about the explosion's magnitude.

But hearsay is generally inadmissible unless there's an exception. Let me think about the exceptions. One possible exception is the excited utterance under FRE 803(2). An excited utterance is a statement made under the stress of a startling event and relates to that event. So if the son made the statement immediately after the explosion, in the excitement of it, it might qualify.

But wait, the plaintiff is recounting what his son said. So the son's statement would have to meet the excited utterance criteria. The son ran into the home screaming that the windows shattered. That sounds like it was right after the explosion, so maybe it's an excited utterance.

Another angle: the plaintiff's own testimony about what he remembered. He's recounting his own memory, which includes his son's statement. So the admissibility depends on whether the son's statement can be exempt from hearsay.

Alternatively, if the son is available, perhaps the statement is not barred by the hearsay rule because it's an excited utterance. Or maybe because the son's availability means the statement is not necessary, but that's more about whether the declarant's availability affects the exception.

Wait, the excited utterance exception doesn't require the declarant to be unavailable. So even if the son is available, the statement can still be admissible as an excited utterance. So the plaintiff's testimony about the son's statement would be admissible under that exception.

But wait, the question is about the admissibility of the plaintiff's statement. The plaintiff is recounting the son's statement to establish the explosion's magnitude. So the son's statement is the hearsay part here.

So the options are considering whether the statement is admissible. Looking at the choices:

Option I says it's inadmissible as hearsay not within any exception. But if it's an excited utterance, then it would fall under an exception, making option I incorrect.

Option E says it's inadmissible under the excited utterance exception because it could be a product of reflection. Hmm, excited utterances are supposed to be spontaneous, without time for reflection. If the son had time to think before making the statement, it might not qualify. But the scenario says the son ran in screaming, which suggests it was immediate.

Option D says it's admissible because it gives context. That's more about relevance, but the issue is hearsay, not relevance.

Option A says it's admissible because the son is available. But availability doesn't directly affect the excited utterance exception. Wait, but if the son is available, the opposing party could call him as a witness. But that doesn't make the statement inadmissible per se; it just means the other side can cross-examine him.

Wait, no, the excited utterance doesn't depend on the declarant's availability. So even if the son is available, the statement can still come in as an excited utterance.

So looking back at the options, the correct reasoning would be that the statement is admissible under the excited utterance exception. So which option aligns with that?

Option E is about it being inadmissible because it's a product of reflection, which I don't think is the case here. So E is incorrect.

Option I says it's inadmissible as hearsay without exception, which is wrong if it's an excited utterance.

So the correct answer should be that it's admissible as an excited utterance. But looking at the options, I don't see an option explicitly stating that. Let me check the options again.

Wait, option G says admissible whether or not the son is available. That could encompass the excited utterance exception, which doesn't require unavailability.

Alternatively, option D says admissible because it gives context, but that's not addressing the hearsay issue.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the hearsay exceptions. Another possibility is that the statement is not offered for the truth, but for the effect on the plaintiff. But in this case, the statement is being offered to show the magnitude of the explosion, so it's for the truth. So it's hearsay.

So without an exception, it's inadmissible. But the excited utterance would make it admissible.

Looking back, the options don't have an option that directly states it's admissible under excited utterance. So perhaps the answer is that it's admissible because it's an excited utterance, making option I incorrect.

Wait, let's look at the options again:

Option I: inadmissible as hearsay not within any exception.

If the statement qualifies as an excited utterance, then it's within an exception, so I would be incorrect. So the correct answer would not be I.

Looking for an option that allows it under an exception. The closest is option D, but that's about relevance, not hearsay.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. The plaintiff's testimony about the son's statement is hearsay. Unless an exception applies, it's inadmissible.

So the question is, does the son's statement qualify as an excited utterance?

The son's statement was made while he was screaming, right after the explosion. So the event (explosion) is the startling event, and the statement (about the car windows shattering) relates to that event. So yes, it's an excited utterance.

Therefore, the statement is admissible under FRE 803(2), so it's not barred by hearsay.

Looking at the options, which one says that? Let's see.

Option G: admissible, whether or not the son is available as a witness. Well, since the excited utterance doesn't depend on availability, G could be correct.

Alternatively, option D says it's admissible because it gives context. But that's more about relevance, not the hearsay exception.

So I think the correct answer is that it's admissible under the excited utterance exception, so option I is incorrect, and the correct choice is perhaps option G or another.

Wait, looking back, option E says it's inadmissible under the excited utterance exception because it could be a product of reflection. But I think that's incorrect because the circumstances suggest spontaneity.

So the correct ruling would be that the testimony is admissible, so the motion to strike should be denied.

Looking at the options, option G says admissible regardless of the son's availability. So that's correct because the excited utterance doesn't require the declarant to be unavailable.

So the answer is G.

The question revolves around the admissibility of the plaintiff's testimony, which includes a statement made by his son ("the car windows just shattered") to establish the magnitude of an explosion. The defendant's attorney moves to strike this testimony, and the issue is whether it is admissible under the rules of evidence.

The plaintiff's testimony includes the son's statement, which constitutes hearsay because it is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (that the explosion shattered the windows). Hearsay is generally inadmissible unless an exception applies. One potential exception is the "excited utterance" rule under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(2), which allows admission of a statement made under the stress of a startling event, provided it relates to the event and is made without time for reflection or deliberation.

The son's statement was made immediately after the explosion, while he was screaming and running into the house. This suggests that the statement was spontaneous and made under the stress of the startling event, qualifying it as an excited utterance. The availability of the son as a witness does not affect the admissibility of the statement under this exception, as the excited utterance rule does not require the declarant to be unavailable.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The son's availability does not determine admissibility under the excited utterance exception.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The son's testimony is not necessary for the plaintiff's statement to be admissible.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The statement is not inadmissible as "secondhand information" because it qualifies under an exception.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. While the statement provides context, this does not address the hearsay issue.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The statement is not inadmissible under the excited utterance exception; it is spontaneous, not reflective.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The statement's relevance does not resolve the hearsay issue.
- **Option G**: Correct. The statement is admissible as an excited utterance, regardless of the son's availability.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The plaintiff's statement is not inadmissible simply because it is based on the son's account.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The statement is admissible under the excited utterance exception, so it is not inadmissible as hearsay without an exception.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The son's testimony is not required for the statement to be admissible.

The correct ruling is that the testimony is admissible under the excited utterance exception, making **Option G** the correct answer.

Answer: G
