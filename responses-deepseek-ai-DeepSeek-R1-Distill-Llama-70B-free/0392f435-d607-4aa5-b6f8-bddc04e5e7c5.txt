Okay, so I've got this probability question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that A and B are independent events. Their probabilities are given: P(A) is 1/4 and P(B) is 2/3. I'm supposed to compute P(A ∩ B), which is the probability that both A and B occur. The options are from A to J, each with different fractions.

Hmm, right, I remember that when two events are independent, the probability of both happening is the product of their individual probabilities. So, independent events mean that the occurrence of one doesn't affect the probability of the other. That's the key here.

So, P(A ∩ B) equals P(A) multiplied by P(B). Let me calculate that. P(A) is 1/4, and P(B) is 2/3. Multiplying them together: 1/4 * 2/3. Let's see, 1 times 2 is 2, and 4 times 3 is 12. So 2/12, which simplifies to 1/6.

Wait, but I should double-check. So, 1/4 is 0.25, and 2/3 is approximately 0.6667. Multiplying 0.25 by 0.6667 gives roughly 0.1667, which is about 1/6. Yeah, that makes sense.

Looking at the options, option I is 1/6. So the correct answer should be I.

I don't think I missed anything here. Since the events are independent, multiplication applies directly. No need to worry about conditional probabilities or anything more complicated.

To determine \( P(A \cap B) \) for independent events \( A \) and \( B \), we use the property that the probability of both events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities. Given \( P(A) = \frac{1}{4} \) and \( P(B) = \frac{2}{3} \), we calculate:

\[
P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B) = \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

I: \(\frac{1}{6}\).
