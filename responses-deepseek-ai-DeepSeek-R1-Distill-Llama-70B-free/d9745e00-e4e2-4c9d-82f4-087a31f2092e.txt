Question:

In what ways is defining coercive diplomacy success problematic?

Options:

A: Isolation of the effect that the threat of force or the limited use of force, in a given case is dependent on the sufficiency of the "stick" for success. The question to ask is whether the stick employed was sufficient to produce compliance.
B: Success is an independent function from the amount of coercion required to produce compliance. Ideally, coercion should be required to solve all disputes. If the threshold from persuasion to coercion is crossed, the degree of success is equated to the production intended outcome: to stop or undo an action.
C: In protracted diplomatic affairs involving a series of inconclusive exchanges which results in tactical/temporary successes followed by new acts of non-compliance, the production of the intended outcome (compliance and ceasing of actions) is regarded as a success from a policy goal perspective.
D: Coercive diplomacy success resulting from the use of threats and sanctions (inducements may, but need not, be employed) are classified as cheap successes. Successes resulting from the use of limited force count as costly ones. Compliance can only be considered a success if the outcome is lasting.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about coercive diplomacy and why defining its success is problematic. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I need to understand what coercive diplomacy is. From what I remember, coercive diplomacy involves using threats or limited force to influence another state's behavior. It's like when a country threatens sanctions or military action to make another country comply with certain demands.

The question is asking about the problems in defining when coercive diplomacy is successful. So, the options are A through D, each giving a different perspective.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: This talks about isolating the effect of the threat of force. It says we need to determine if the "stick" used was sufficient to produce compliance. So, the problem here is figuring out whether the specific threat or limited force was the actual reason for the other side's compliance. Because maybe other factors were at play, and it's hard to isolate the effect of the coercion itself. That makes sense as a challenge because it's not always clear if the coercion alone caused the outcome.

Option B: Here, success is independent of the coercion level. It suggests that once the threshold from persuasion to coercion is crossed, success is just about achieving the intended outcome. But wait, the problem here might be assuming that any use of coercion automatically leads to success. But in reality, the degree of coercion needed can vary, and just crossing into coercion doesn't guarantee success. Also, the statement that coercion should solve all disputes seems off because diplomacy often involves more nuanced approaches. So, this might not be the best answer because it oversimplifies success based solely on crossing into coercion.

Option C: This option discusses protracted diplomatic situations where there are tactical successes followed by non-compliance. It says that achieving the intended outcome is a success from a policy perspective. The problem here would be that short-term successes don't necessarily translate to long-term compliance. If the other side only temporarily complies and then resumes their actions, can we really call it a success? It's tricky because the outcome might be immediate, but not lasting. So, defining success in such cases is problematic because it's hard to determine whether the compliance is permanent or just temporary.

Option D: This talks about classifying successes as cheap or costly based on whether threats/sanctions or limited force were used. It also mentions that compliance must be lasting to be considered a success. The issue here is that determining whether the outcome is lasting can be difficult. Compliance might last for a while but then fade, making it hard to assess the long-term effectiveness of the coercive diplomacy. Also, the cost aspect might not directly correlate with success because sometimes cheaper methods (like sanctions) can be effective, but not always.

Now, putting it all together. The question is about what makes defining success problematic. Option A points to the difficulty in isolating the effect of coercion, which can be a methodological challenge. Option C highlights the issue of temporary vs. lasting compliance, which complicates defining success because it's hard to know when to measure the outcome. Option D brings up the need for lasting compliance, which is a time-dependent factor.

I think the most problematic aspect is when you have situations where there are temporary successes followed by non-compliance. This makes it hard to evaluate the overall success because the outcome isn't sustained. So, the problem lies in situations where there are repeated exchanges without a clear resolution, making it difficult to pinpoint when the diplomacy was successful.

So, the correct answer should be C. Because in protracted cases with temporary successes, it's challenging to define success as the outcome might not last, leading to further issues down the line.

The question revolves around the challenges in defining the success of coercive diplomacy. Coercive diplomacy involves the use of threats, sanctions, or limited force to influence another state's behavior. The problem arises in determining when such efforts can be deemed successful, as success is often context-dependent and influenced by various factors.

Option A highlights the difficulty in isolating the specific impact of coercion, as other factors might contribute to compliance. This makes it challenging to attribute success solely to the coercive measures employed. Option B oversimplifies success by equating it to crossing the threshold from persuasion to coercion, ignoring the complexity of varying coercion levels and the potential for nuanced outcomes. Option D introduces the idea of classifying successes as "cheap" or "costly" based on the methods used and emphasizes the need for lasting compliance, which can be hard to assess over time.

However, Option C stands out as the most problematic scenario. It addresses protracted diplomatic situations where tactical or temporary successes are followed by new acts of non-compliance. This creates ambiguity in defining success because short-term compliance does not guarantee long-term adherence to the desired outcome. The challenge lies in determining whether the intended outcome is sustained, making it difficult to evaluate the overall effectiveness of coercive diplomacy.
