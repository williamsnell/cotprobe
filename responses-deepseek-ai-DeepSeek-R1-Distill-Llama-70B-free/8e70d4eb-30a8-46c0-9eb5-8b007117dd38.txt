Options:

H: Cognitive dissonance is a theory about personality traits
I: Cognitive dissonance is a theory that states that cognitions can have one of three relations to one another - consonant, irrelevant, or dissonant.

Okay, so I have this question about cognitive dissonance as explained by Festinger. I need to choose the correct definition from the given options. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that cognitive dissonance is a concept in psychology. I think it's related to how people feel when their beliefs or actions conflict. From what I've studied before, Festinger's theory is about the discomfort people experience when they hold two conflicting thoughts, or cognitions, at the same time. This discomfort motivates them to reduce the dissonance somehow, maybe by changing their attitude or behavior.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's a learning theory about adapting behavior to match intentions. Hmm, I'm not sure. I think cognitive dissonance is more about the internal conflict rather than learning processes.

Option B talks about difficulty in decision-making due to too many choices. That sounds more like analysis paralysis, not exactly dissonance.

Option C mentions a motivational theory with positive reinforcement leading to attitude change. Wait, Festinger's theory is more about reducing discomfort from conflicting thoughts, not necessarily positive reinforcement.

Option D is about memory retention. No, that's not right. Cognitive dissonance isn't about memory.

Option E says it's a state where someone is aware and accepting of conflicting attitudes. No, I think the oppositeâ€”dissonance causes discomfort, so people aren't accepting of the conflict.

Option F is about emotional stability. Not exactly, though emotional discomfort is part of it.

Option G claims beliefs and actions are always in harmony. That's the opposite of dissonance, so definitely not.

Option H is about personality traits. No, it's more about attitudes and beliefs.

Option I says cognitions can be consonant, irrelevant, or dissonant, and dissonant ones cause negative motivation to reduce dissonance. That sounds exactly like what I was thinking earlier.

Option J is a social theory about group decisions. No, cognitive dissonance is more individual.

So the correct answer should be option I.

The correct answer is I. Cognitive dissonance, as explained by Festinger, refers to a psychological phenomenon where individuals experience discomfort due to conflicting beliefs or actions. This discomfort is a negative motivational state that drives them to reduce the dissonance. Option I accurately describes this by stating that cognitions can be consonant, irrelevant, or dissonant, with dissonant ones leading to contradictory behaviors and a motivation to reduce the discomfort.

Answer: I
