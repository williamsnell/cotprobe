Question:

A 16-year-old girl is brought to the office by her mother because she is concerned that she may have contracted meningitis from her soccer teammate, who was diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis and admitted to the hospital yesterday. The patient's soccer team traveled to a neighboring state to participate in a tournament 1 week ago and she shared a hotel room with the girl who was hospitalized. The patient feels well but is concerned she may have "caught the same bug." Medical history is remarkable for asthma. Medications include inhaled albuterol. Vital signs are temperature 37.2°C (98.9°F), pulse 64/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 107/58 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention for this patient at this time?

Options:

A: Administer a tetanus shot
B: Prescribe azithromycin
C: Administer the meningococcal vaccine
D: Prescribe ibuprofen
E: Prescribe penicillin
F: Administer the pneumococcal vaccine
G: Prescribe amoxicillin
H: Prescribe doxycycline
I: Prescribe rifampin
J: No intervention is needed at this time

Okay, so I have this question about a 16-year-old girl who's worried she might have gotten meningitis from her teammate. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the scenario: her teammate was diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis and is in the hospital. They shared a hotel room recently, so they were in close contact. The patient feels fine but is concerned. Her vitals are normal, and the physical exam shows nothing. So, she's asymptomatic right now.

I remember that meningococcal meningitis is caused by Neisseria meningitidis. It's a serious infection that can spread through close contact, like sharing a room. Now, the question is about what to do for her. The options are various medications and vaccines.

I think about how meningitis is managed. If someone is exposed but not showing symptoms, the main concern is whether they've been colonized by the bacteria and could develop the disease. So, prophylaxis might be necessary to prevent the infection from taking hold. 

Prophylactic antibiotics are given to close contacts to kill the bacteria before they cause infection. Common choices for prophylaxis include rifampin, ciprofloxacin, or ceftriaxone. I think the options here include rifampin (option I) and penicillin (option E), amoxicillin (G), and others.

Wait, but penicillin is actually not the first choice for prophylaxis. Rifampin is typically used for this purpose. Because the patient is asymptomatic and was in close contact, the recommendation would be prophylactic antibiotics. So, she doesn't need treatment, just prevention.

Looking at the options, option I is rifampin. So that's a possibility. But wait, another thought: sometimes, when exposure is recent, the vaccine might be given. But the meningococcal vaccine is usually given to prevent the disease before exposure, not after. Because vaccines take time to induce immunity, giving it now wouldn't help immediately. Plus, if she's already been exposed, the vaccine won't prevent the current risk.

So the correct approach here is prophylactic antibiotics. But let me make sure about the options. Option I is rifampin—yes, that's correct. However, I should also consider if any other options are appropriate. For example, option E is penicillin, but I don't think that's right for prophylaxis. Penicillin is more for treatment once symptoms appear.

Another thing to consider: the patient's medical history. She has asthma and uses albuterol. I don't think that affects the choice here because the antibiotics like rifampin are not contraindicated in asthma. So, no issues there.

So putting it all together: she needs prophylaxis, and the best option is rifampin. So the answer should be I.

The patient is a 16-year-old girl who is asymptomatic but was in close contact with a teammate diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis. Meningococcal meningitis is caused by Neisseria meningitidis and can spread through close contact. Since the patient is asymptomatic but at risk, the focus is on prophylaxis to prevent infection.

Prophylactic antibiotics are recommended for close contacts of individuals with meningococcal meningitis. Common options include rifampin, ciprofloxacin, or ceftriaxone. Among the provided options, rifampin (option I) is the most appropriate choice for prophylaxis. Penicillin (option E) and amoxicillin (option G) are not typically used for prophylaxis in this context. Vaccination (options C and F) is not effective for immediate prevention following exposure, as vaccines take time to induce immunity.

Given the patient’s asymptomatic status, normal vital signs, and close contact with the infected individual, the most appropriate intervention is prophylactic rifampin.

Answer: I
