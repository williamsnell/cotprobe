Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about two objects, A and B, that have equal charge and equal mass. Neither is moving because the gravitational and electrostatic forces between them are equal. Now, if the mass of Object A is halved, we need to find out what change would maintain equilibrium.

Wait, equilibrium here means that the forces are still balanced, right? So initially, the gravitational force equals the electrostatic force. Let me write that down.

The gravitational force between them is F_grav = G*(m_A * m_B)/r². And the electrostatic force is F_elec = k*(q_A * q_B)/r². Since they're equal at equilibrium, G*(m_A m_B) = k*(q_A q_B).

Initially, m_A = m_B and q_A = q_B. So substituting that in, we get G*(m²) = k*(q²). That makes sense because both masses and charges are equal.

Now, the mass of A is halved. So m_A becomes m_A/2. But what about the charges? The problem is asking what needs to happen for equilibrium to hold again. So the new forces must balance again.

Wait, so after changing the mass, the forces should still be equal. So the new F_grav should equal the new F_elec. Let me think: after the change, m_A is now (m_A/2), m_B remains m (assuming m_B doesn't change unless the options say so). The charges might change, but the problem is about what changes are needed.

Wait, but the options involve changing either charges or masses, so I need to see what adjustment keeps the forces equal.

Let me write the new force equations.

After change:
F_grav' = G*( (m_A/2) * m_B ) / r²
F_elec' = k*( q_A' * q_B' ) / r²

We want F_grav' = F_elec'.

Initially, F_grav = F_elec so G m^2 = k q^2, since m_A = m_B = m and q_A = q_B = q.

After the change, m_A is m/2. So F_grav' = G*( (m/2) * m ) / r² = G*(m²/2)/r².

So we have F_grav' = (G m²)/(2 r²).

Now, the electrostatic force must equal this. So F_elec' must be (G m²)/(2 r²).

But F_elec' is k*(q_A' q_B')/r².

So k*(q_A' q_B')/r² = (G m²)/(2 r²)

Simplify both sides by multiplying by r²:

k q_A' q_B' = (G m²)/2

But from the initial condition, G m² = k q². So substituting that in:

k q_A' q_B' = (k q²)/2

Divide both sides by k:

q_A' q_B' = q² / 2.

So the product of the charges after change should be half of the original product.

Now, let's think about how the charges can be changed. The options involve changing either A's charge, B's charge, or both. Let's look at the possible options.

Option A: Charge on A is halved. So q_A' = q/2. Then what about q_B'? The product would be (q/2) * q_B' = q² / 2. So solving for q_B':

(q/2) * q_B' = q²/2 → q_B' = (q²/2) / (q/2) )= q.

So q_B' = q. So if A is halved and B remains the same, the product is (q/2)*q = q²/2, which meets the condition. So that would work. So option A is a possibility.

But wait, what if both are changed? Let's check the options.

Option C: Both mass and charge on A are halved. Wait, but the mass is already halved in the problem statement. The question says the mass of A is halved, and then asks what else needs to be done. So in this case, if the mass is halved and the charge is also halved, what happens?

Wait, the scenario is that the mass is halved, and then we're looking for what change in charges (or mass, if any) would keep equilibrium.

Wait, the problem says, "If the mass of Object A is halved, equilibrium will be maintained if..." So the mass is now m/2 for A, and the question is what else must change. So possibly, the charge on A or B must change, or some other mass.

So, going back, the condition after mass change is q_A' q_B' = q^2 / 2.

Let me think of the possible options.

Option A is charge on A halved. Then q_A' = q/2, so q_B' must remain q, as we saw.

Option B: charge on B is doubled. So q_B' = 2q. Then q_A' would have to satisfy (q_A')*(2q) = q²/2 → q_A' = (q²/2)/(2q) )= q/4. So charge on A would be a quarter. But that's not one of the options. So option B would require A's charge to be quartered, which isn't mentioned.

Option C: Both mass and charge on A are halved. Wait, but the mass is already halved. So if mass is already halved, and then charge is halved, then q_A' q_B' = (q/2) * q = q²/2, which satisfies the condition. So that would work, but the option says both mass and charge on A are halved. But the mass is already being halved as per the question. So in that case, option C would be making the mass of A (m/2), and the charge (q/2). So the product would be (m/2)*m * G for gravity, but wait no, the gravitational is based on m_A and m_B. Oh wait, no, the masses are m/2 and m. So the gravitational force would be G*( (m/2)*m ) / r² = G m²/(2 r²), same as before. The electrostatic force would be k*( (q/2)*q ) / r² = k q²/(2 r²), which equals the gravitational. So that works. So option C would satisfy the condition.

Wait, but the question says the mass of A is halved. So the initial change is mass A is m/2. Now, the options are what else must happen. So in option C, it says both mass and charge on A are halved. But the mass is already being halved by the problem statement. So does option C imply that mass is halved again, making it m/4? That can't be right, because the problem says the mass is halved once.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the options. Let me read again.

The question states that the mass of A is halved. Then, the options are about what else needs to happen. So the correct scenario is that the mass of A is now m/2, and the system must adjust charges (or perhaps other masses) to maintain equilibrium.

So in option C, it's saying that both the mass and charge on A are halved. But the mass is already halved by the problem statement. So in this case, if option C is chosen, the mass of A becomes (m/2)/2 = m/4? That can't be, because the problem states that the mass is halved. So perhaps option C is incorrect because it would involve halving the mass beyond what the problem states.

Alternatively, perhaps the option is considering that the mass is halved, so it's part of the condition. Wait, no, the question says the mass is halved, and now the equilibrium must be maintained. So the options are suggesting possible changes along with the mass halving.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the condition.

After the mass of A is halved, what change in charges will make F_grav = F_elec.

Alternative approach: Let me write the initial condition and the new condition.

Initial condition:
F_grav_initial = F_elec_initial
G (m_A m_B) / r² = k (q_A q_B) / r²
Since m_A = m_B = m, and q_A = q_B = q,
G m² = k q².

After A's mass is halved, the new gravitational force is:
F_grav_new = G ( (m/2) * m ) / r² = G m²/(2 r²).

We need the electrostatic force to equal F_grav_new. So,

F_elec_new = k (q_A' q_B') / r² = G m²/(2 r²).

From the initial condition, G m² = k q², so substituting:

k (q_A' q_B') / r² = (k q²) / (2 r²)
Cancel k and r²:
q_A' q_B' = q² / 2.

So the product of the new charges must be q²/2.

Now, looking at the options to see which change results in q_A' q_B' = q²/2.

Option A: Charge on A is halved.

So q_A' = q/2, q_B' = q (since option A only changes A's charge).

Then product is (q/2)*q = q²/2. Which matches. So option A works.

Option B: Charge on B is doubled. So q_B' = 2q. Then q_A' must be (q²/2)/(2q) = q/4. So A's charge would be q/4, but this option doesn't say that, so it's not an option.

Option C: Both mass and charge on A are halved. But the mass is already halved in the problem statement. So if C is chosen, mass would be halved again, making it m/4. But that's not what the problem says; the problem says the mass is halved. So this would cause the gravitational force to be G*(m/4 * m) = G m²/4, which is less than the required F_grav_new of G m²/2. So that wouldn't work. So option C is incorrect.

Wait, no, maybe option C implies that when the mass is halved, the charge is also halved. So in that case, m_A is m/2, q_A is q/2. Then the gravitational force is G*(m/2)*m / r² = G m²/(2 r²). The electrostatic force is k*(q/2 * q)/r² = k q²/(2 r²). But since initially k q² = G m², so k q²/(2 r²) = G m²/(2 r²). So the forces are equal. So option C would work.

But wait, the problem states that the mass of A is halved, and then asks what else needs to happen. So option C includes halving the mass (which is already done) and halving the charge. So if you halve the mass and halve the charge on A, it works.

Alternatively, if you only halve the mass and don't change the charge, the forces wouldn't balance. So you need to adjust the charges as well.

Wait, but the question is, after the mass is halved, what change is needed. So the mass is already m/2, so perhaps the charges are adjusted. So perhaps option C is the correct answer, because it includes both mass and charge on A being halved.

Wait, but the problem says "If the mass of Object A is halved, equilibrium will be maintained if...", so the mass is halved (given), and the question is what else must be done. So the option must involve either changing charges on A or B, or perhaps the mass of B.

Wait, looking back, option C says both mass and charge on A are halved. But the problem says mass is halved, so perhaps option C is the correct answer because it's combining both changes. Alternatively, is there another option that achieves the same?

Wait, let's check option A again. Option A says the charge on A is halved. So q_A' = q/2, and B's charge remains q. Then the product is (q/2)*q = q²/2, which meets the condition. So that would also maintain equilibrium.

So both options A and C seem to work. But let me think again.

In option C, both mass and charge of A are halved. But the problem already says the mass is halved. So in the scenario, the mass is halved, and in addition, the charge on A is halved. So that works.

In option A, only the charge on A is halved, which also works.

So which option is correct according to the problem?

Wait, the question is phrased as: If the mass of A is halved, equilibrium is maintained if which of the following is done. So the options are possible changes that could accompany the mass halving.

So in one case, you could halve the charge on A (option A) and leave B's charge the same. Alternatively, you could halve both mass and charge on A (option C), but since the problem says the mass is already halved, perhaps option C would require an additional halving of the mass beyond what's stated.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think carefully. The problem says the mass of A is halved, and now we're looking for what else needs to happen. So the options are about what other changes are needed besides the mass being halved. So perhaps the correct option is A, because it only changes the charge on A.

Alternatively, option C says both mass and charge on A are halved. But if the mass is already halved, then option C would require the mass to be halved again, which is m/4. That's not what the problem states. So maybe option C is incorrect.

Wait, no. The option C is presented as a possible condition for equilibrium. So when the mass is halved (as per the question), and the charge on A is halved, that would satisfy the condition. So option C would include both actions, but the problem already includes the mass being halved. So perhaps option C is a possible correct answer because it includes both necessary changes.

Wait, but the problem says the mass is halved, and then we're to choose what else is done. So the correct option should involve only a change in charge, perhaps.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me approach it differently. Let me list the possible options and see which ones satisfy q_A' q_B' = q² / 2.

Option A: q_A' = q/2, q_B' = q. So product is (q/2)*q = q²/2. Correct.

Option B: q_B' = 2q, so q_A' must be (q²/2)/(2q) = q/4. So this would require A's charge to be q/4. But option B only changes B's charge, so that's not sufficient. So option B isn't correct.

Option C: q_A' = q/2, q_B' = q. Because the mass is already halved, and charge on A is halved. So the product is (q/2)*q = q²/2. Correct.

Option D: q_B' = q/2. Then q_A' would have to be (q²/2)/(q/2) )= q. So A's charge remains same. So product would be q*(q/2)=q²/2. Correct. So option D would also work if B's charge is halved.

Wait, option D says the charge on B is halved. So q_B' = q/2, and q_A' remains q. Then product is q*(q/2)=q²/2. So that would also maintain equilibrium.

So both options A and D would work. But the options are presented as A through J, so I need to check which one is among the options.

Looking back at the options, option D is "the charge on Object B were halved." So if B's charge is halved, then the product becomes q * (q/2) = q²/2, which works.

So now I have options A, C, and D as possible correct answers because they lead to the product being q²/2.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "If the mass of Object A is halved, equilibrium will be maintained if...". So the mass is halved, and what else is done. So in option C, both the mass and charge on A are halved. But the problem already says the mass is halved, so if option C is chosen, that would mean the mass is halved again, making it m/4. Which would not align with the question's setup. So perhaps option C is not correct.

Similarly, option A only changes the charge on A, which works. Option D only changes the charge on B, which also works.

Wait a minute, so the question allows for multiple possibilities? But the options are presented as a single choice.

Wait, the options are:

A: charge A halved

B: charge B doubled

C: mass A and charge A both halved

D: charge B halved

E: mass B doubled

F: mass and charge B doubled

G: mass A doubled

H: mass B halved

I: charge A doubled

J: mass and charge A doubled

So the possible correct options are A, C, D.

But which one is correct based on the problem.

Alternative approach: Let's think about the forces again.

After mass A is halved, the gravitational force is (G m²)/2. The electrostatic force must be equal to that. So the product of the charges must be (q²)/2.

So the product of the charges must be halved. How can that happen? Either:

- One charge is halved, and the other remains same.

- Both charges are reduced by a factor sqrt(1/2), but that's not among the options.

So the options that result in the product being halved are:

A: q_A' = q/2, q_B' = q → product q²/2.

C: q_A' = q/2, q_B' = q → same as A, but also mass is halved, which is already done.

D: q_B' = q/2, q_A' = q → product q²/2.

So both A and D would achieve the desired product.

Wait, so are both options A and D correct? But the question expects
