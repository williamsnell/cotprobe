Question:

A 32-year-old man who is a jackhammer operator comes to the physician because of pain and swelling of his right arm for 3 days. The symptoms are moderately exacerbated by exertion. Examination of the right upper extremity shows erythema and moderate edema. Capillary refill time is less than 3 seconds. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:

A: Axillary-subclavian venous thrombosis
B: Deep venous valvular insufficiency
C: Superficial thrombophlebitis of the basilic vein
D: Superior vena cava syndrome

Okay, so I have this medical question in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read it carefully.

The patient is a 32-year-old man who works as a jackhammer operator. He's complaining of pain and swelling in his right arm for the past three days. His symptoms get worse when he exerts himself. On examination, there's erythema (redness) and moderate edema (swelling) in the right upper extremity. The capillary refill time is less than 3 seconds. I need to determine the most likely diagnosis from the options given.

First, I'll break down the key points. His job as a jackhammer operator probably involves a lot of repetitive motion and vibration, which might contribute to certain conditions. He's presenting with arm pain and swelling that's worse with exertion. The presence of erythema and edema suggests some inflammation or possibly a vascular issue.

Looking at the options:

A: Axillary-subclavian venous thrombosis
B: Deep venous valvular insufficiency
C: Superficial thrombophlebitis of the basilic vein
D: Superior vena cava syndrome

I need to consider each option.

Option A: Axillary-subclavian venous thrombosis. This is also known as Paget-Schroetter syndrome, often related to thoracic outlet syndrome. It's more common in younger individuals who do repetitive arm movements. Symptoms include arm swelling, pain, and possibly discoloration. It can be associated with exertion because the thrombosis would impede blood flow, especially when the arm is used.

Option B: Deep venous valvular insufficiency. This typically refers to issues like post-thrombotic syndrome where the valves in the deep veins don't function properly, leading to chronic venous insufficiency. Symptoms include swelling, especially when standing, and might get worse over the day. But this usually affects the lower extremities more often than the upper. Plus, capillary refill being normal (less than 3 seconds) might not align perfectly since venous insufficiency can cause more pronounced swelling.

Option C: Superficial thrombophlebitis of the basilic vein. This is inflammation of a superficial vein (like the basilic or cephalic veins) due to a clot. It's often associated with a palpable, tender cord along the path of the vein. Erythema and edema would be present locally. However, capillary refill is about the microcirculation, which should still be normal in superficial thrombophlebitis. Also, the symptoms are usually more localized along the vein.

Option D: Superior vena cava syndrome. This is caused by obstruction of the superior vena cava, leading to facial swelling, arm swelling, and possibly shortness of breath. It's more associated with malignancies or central venous catheters. The patient here doesn't have symptoms like facial edema, so this seems less likely.

Back to the patient's symptoms: the pain and swelling are in the right arm. His job uses a lot of arm activity, which might cause repetitive trauma to the veins. The fact that capillary refill is less than 3 seconds suggests that the arterial supply is still good because capillary refill is a measure of peripheral circulationâ€”so the microcirculation is intact.

Axillary-subclavian venous thrombosis (option A) would cause obstruction of the major veins draining the arm. This leads to increased venous pressure when the arm is used, as the blood can't return to the heart as efficiently. So during exertion, the swelling and pain would worsen. Also, the presence of erythema and edema fits because blood pools in the extremity. The capillary refill being normal suggests that the arterial supply is not compromised, which aligns because this is a venous issue.

Superficial thrombophlebitis (option C) is possible, but it's more localized and might not cause as much generalized swelling of the entire arm. Plus, the history of repetitive motion points more towards a deeper venous issue related to the thoracic outlet.

So putting it all together, the most likely diagnosis is axillary-subclavian venous thrombosis, which is option A.
</think>

The patient is a 32-year-old jackhammer operator presenting with pain and swelling in his right arm, worsened by exertion. Examination reveals erythema, moderate edema, and normal capillary refill time (<3 seconds). His occupation suggests repetitive arm movements, which can contribute to venous thrombosis. 

- **Option A (Axillary-subclavian venous thrombosis):** This condition, also known as Paget-Schroetter syndrome, is common in younger individuals with repetitive arm movements. It causes arm swelling, pain, and erythema due to venous obstruction, worsening with exertion. The normal capillary refill indicates intact arterial circulation, consistent with a venous issue. This aligns well with the patient's symptoms and history.

- **Option B (Deep venous valvular insufficiency):** Typically affects the lower extremities and causes chronic swelling that worsens over the day. It is less likely in this case due to the upper extremity involvement and the acute presentation.

- **Option C (Superficial thrombophlebitis of the basilic vein):** This involves inflammation of a superficial vein, presenting as a palpable, tender cord with localized erythema and edema. However, it does not typically cause generalized arm swelling or worsening symptoms with exertion to the same extent.

- **Option D (Superior vena cava syndrome):** Characterized by facial swelling, arm edema, and shortness of breath due to superior vena cava obstruction. The absence of facial edema or respiratory symptoms makes this diagnosis unlikely.

The most likely diagnosis is **axillary-subclavian venous thrombosis**, as it explains the patient's symptoms, occupation, and clinical findings.
