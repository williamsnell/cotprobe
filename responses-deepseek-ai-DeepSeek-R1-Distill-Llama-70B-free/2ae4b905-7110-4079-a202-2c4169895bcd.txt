Question:

Berkowitz (1971) revised the original frustration-aggression hypothesis by proposing that frustration leads to aggression when:

Options:

A: the target of the aggression is of lower-status than the aggressor.
B: the aggressor is experiencing high levels of stress.
C: there are aggressive cues in the environment.
D: acting aggressively is likely to produce desirable outcomes.
E: the target of the aggression has shown previous signs of weakness.
F: the aggressor feels threatened or endangered.
G: the aggression can be blamed on external factors.
H: the aggressor has been previously rewarded for aggressive behavior.
I: there is a lack of social support for the aggressor.
J: the aggressor has an internal locus of control.

Okay, so I've got this question about Berkowitz and his revisions to the frustration-aggression hypothesis. I remember that the original hypothesis was by Dollard and colleagues, right? They proposed that frustration always leads to aggression. But Berkowitz came along and changed that, so I need to think about what he added.

Berkowitz's revision was about the conditions under which frustration leads to aggression. I think he said that frustration doesn't always cause aggression. Instead, it's more about the circumstances surrounding the frustration. Oh wait, I remember something about cues. Like, if there are aggressive cues present, then frustration is more likely to turn into aggression.

So looking at the options, let me go through them one by one. Option C says there are aggressive cues in the environment. That rings a bell. Berkowitz's model included the idea that environmental factors, like seeing something aggressive, could trigger the aggression after frustration.

Other options: A talks about lower status targets. I'm not sure Berkowitz's revision was about the target's status. Maybe that's more related to other theories about choosing targets. B is about high stress, but stress is a bit different from frustration. Frustration is a specific cause, not just any stress.

D says aggression leads to desirable outcomes. That sounds more like reinforcement or something from learning theory. Berkowitz's point was more about the presence of cues. E is about the target showing weakness, which again might be about target selection but not the trigger for aggression from frustration.

F is feeling threatened. That might tie into other theories, like the cognitive neo-association model, where feeling threatened leads to arousal which can cause aggression. But Berkowitz's revision was about the conditions when frustration leads to aggression, which I think includes the presence of cues.

G is blaming aggression on external factors. That sounds like a justification or maybe a displacement concept, not Berkowitz. H is about being rewarded for aggression, which again is learning theory, not Berkowitz's condition.

I is lack of social support. Not sure how that ties in. Berkowitz's model is more about immediate environmental factors. J is internal locus of control, which is a different concept related to personality, not directly about when frustration leads to aggression.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be option C: there are aggressive cues in the environment.

The question asks about Berkowitz's revision to the frustration-aggression hypothesis. Berkowitz proposed that frustration leads to aggression under specific conditions, rather than being an automatic response. The key addition he made was the role of environmental cues, particularly aggressive cues, in triggering aggression following frustration.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, E, F, G, I, J**: These options relate to other concepts like target selection, stress, feeling threatened, external blame, social support, or personality traits, which are not central to Berkowitz's revision.
- **B, D, H**: These pertain to stress, reinforcement, or learning theory, which are not directly tied to Berkowitz's specific condition involving environmental cues.
- **C**: This option directly aligns with Berkowitz's idea that aggressive cues in the environment facilitate the transformation of frustration into aggression.

Thus, the correct answer is **C: there are aggressive cues in the environment**.

Answer: C
