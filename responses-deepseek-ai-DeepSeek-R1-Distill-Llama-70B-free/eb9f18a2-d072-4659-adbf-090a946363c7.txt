Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Hersey and Blanchard’s situational leadership model. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The question is asking about when a leader should use a "participative" style. The options are about the subordinates' ability and motivation levels. I remember that Hersey and Blanchard's model categorizes leadership styles based on followers' competence and commitment.

From what I recall, the model has four main leadership styles: telling, selling, participating, and delegating. Each style corresponds to different levels of follower ability and motivation.

Let me outline each style:

1. **Telling (S1)**: This is for when followers are low in both ability and motivation. The leader gives clear instructions and makes decisions without much input from the team.

2. **Selling (S2)**: Used when followers have some ability but maybe lack motivation. The leader provides guidance and explains decisions to encourage buy-in.

3. **Participating (S3)**: Here, the followers have high ability but maybe low motivation. The leader involves them in decision-making to boost their motivation.

4. **Delegating (S4)**: For followers who are high in both ability and motivation. The leader delegates tasks and lets the team take charge.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. So the question is about the participative style. From my notes, S3 is participating, which is when the leader shares ideas and encourages participation. This is when the followers have some competence but may lack confidence or motivation.

So the followers in this case would have high ability but low motivation. Because the leader is trying to get them more involved to increase their motivation. So the leader uses a more supportive and participative approach.

Looking at the options:

A: high ability and high motivation. That sounds like the delegating style, S4. So not this one.

B: low ability and high motivation. That would be S2, selling style, because the motivation is there but ability isn't. So leader guides.

C: low ability and moderate motivation. Maybe S2 as well, but I'm not sure.

D: moderate ability and low motivation. Possibly S2 or S1 depending on exact levels.

E: low ability and low motivation. That's S1, telling style.

F: high ability and low motivation. That fits S3, participating style. Because the subordinate can do the work (high ability) but isn't motivated, so the leader involves them to build motivation.

So the correct answer should be F.

Hersey and Blanchard’s situational leadership model categorizes leadership styles based on followers' competence and commitment. The "participative" style (S3) is appropriate when subordinates have high ability but low motivation. This style involves the leader sharing ideas and encouraging participation to boost motivation while leveraging the subordinate's ability. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: High ability and high motivation → Delegating style (S4). Incorrect.  
- **B**: Low ability and high motivation → Selling style (S2). Incorrect.  
- **C**: Low ability and moderate motivation → Likely Selling style (S2). Incorrect.  
- **D**: Moderate ability and low motivation → Likely Selling style (S2). Incorrect.  
- **E**: Low ability and low motivation → Telling style (S1). Incorrect.  
- **F**: High ability and low motivation → Participative style (S3). Correct.  

The correct answer is **F**. 

Answer: F
