Okay, so I've got this math problem here: 52 plus 6 multiplied by 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my math rules, but I remember something about the order of operations. Oh right, PEMDAS or BODMAS or something like that. Wait, PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction. So I think that means I should do the multiplication before the addition here.

Let me break it down. The problem is 52 + 6 * 2. So first, I should calculate 6 multiplied by 2. 6 times 2 is 12. Oh wait, right, because 6+6 is 12, so that's easy. So then I add that result to 52. So 52 plus 12. Let me add that up. 52 plus 10 is 62, and then plus 2 more is 64. So the total should be 64.

Now looking at the options, I need to find which one corresponds to 64. Let me check the options again. The options are A through J. Option J is 64. So the answer should be J.

Wait, did I do that right? Let me double-check. Sometimes I mix up the order. If I had added first, it would be 52 plus 6, which is 58, and then multiplied by 2, that would be 116. But wait, is that correct? No, because according to PEMDAS, multiplication comes before addition. So I shouldn't add 52 and 6 first. So yes, my initial approach was correct. So 6*2 is 12, plus 52 is 64. So J is the correct answer.

The problem requires computing 52 + 6 * 2. Following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), multiplication precedes addition. Thus, 6 * 2 = 12. Adding this to 52 gives 52 + 12 = 64. Among the options, 64 corresponds to option J.
