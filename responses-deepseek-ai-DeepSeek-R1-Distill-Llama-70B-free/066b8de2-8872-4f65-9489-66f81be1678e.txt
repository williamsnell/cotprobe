Okay, so I've got this problem about estimating the volume of a liver using the CAT scan cross-sections and the Midpoint Rule. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, let's read the question again. The CAT scan takes cross-sectional views spaced 1.5 cm apart. The liver is 15 cm long. The cross-sectional areas given are: 0, 18, 58, 79, 94, 106, 117, 128, 63, 39, and 0. We need to use the Midpoint Rule to find the volume.

Wait, the Midpoint Rule? I remember that's a method for estimating integrals, right? So, the idea is to approximate the integral of the area with respect to the position, which gives the volume.

The formula for the Midpoint Rule when approximating the integral from a to b is: Δx * [f(m1) + f(m2) + ... + f(mn)], where mi are the midpoints of each subinterval. Oh wait, but each cross-section is equally spaced, so Δx is the same between each data point.

Wait, but in this case, the data points are at intervals of 1.5 cm. So each cross-sectional area is taken at a point that's 1.5 cm apart. But wait, how many intervals are there? Hmm.

Wait, the liver is 15 cm long, and the spacing is 1.5 cm. So the number of intervals would be 15 / 1.5 = 10 intervals. But how many data points? Let me count the given areas. There are 11 areas listed: 0,18,58,79,94,106,117,128,63,39,0. Oh right, because if you have 10 intervals, you have 11 points (from 0 to 10). So each point is at 0, 1.5, 3.0, ... up to 15 cm.

But wait, the Midpoint Rule uses the areas at the midpoints between the data points. So the midpoints would be at 0.75 cm, 2.25 cm, etc. Wait, but the given data points are at 0, 1.5, 3.0, so the midpoints between them are at (0 + 1.5)/2 = 0.75, (1.5 + 3.0)/2 = 2.25, and so on.

Wait, but how does that apply here? Because the CAT scan gives us the areas at positions 0, 1.5, 3.0, etc., but to use the Midpoint Rule, we need the areas at the midpoints between these positions. Oh wait, but in the problem statement, it says to use the Midpoint Rule to estimate the volume. So perhaps the approach is to model the liver as a series of slices, each of thickness Δx, and each contributing a volume of area * Δx.

Wait no, the standard approach is that the volume is the integral of the cross-sectional area over the length. So Volume = integral from 0 to 15 cm of A(x) dx. And using the Midpoint Rule for this integral.

But the Midpoint Rule requires evaluating the function at the midpoint of each subinterval, but the problem gives us data points at the ends of the subintervals. So perhaps the given data isn't directly the midpoints, but the endpoints. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, maybe the way to think about this is that the cross-sectional areas are given at specific points, but the Midpoint Rule would use the area at the midpoint of each interval. But since we don't have those midpoints, perhaps this is an approximation where we take the given areas as the midpoints. Or maybe the problem is designed so that the given areas are already at the midpoints.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The given data is at positions 0, 1.5, 3.0, ..., 15 cm. So each step is 1.5 cm. There are 11 data points, which means 10 intervals of 1.5 cm each.

If we're using the Midpoint Rule, the Midpoint Rule would require us to evaluate the area at the midpoint of each interval. So for each interval between x_i and x_{i+1}, the midpoint is x_i + Δx/2. So for the first interval (0 to 1.5 cm), the midpoint is at 0.75 cm. Similarly, the next midpoint is at 2.25 cm, etc.

But wait, the given areas are at x = 0, 1.5, 3.0, etc. So the areas at the midpoints are not directly given. So perhaps the problem expects us to use the given data as the midpoint values? Because otherwise, without knowing the areas at the midpoints, we can't proceed.

Wait, another approach: maybe the spacing is 1.5 cm, so each slice is 1.5 cm thick, and the area is measured at the midpoint of each slice. So each slice's volume would be area * 1.5 cm. So, for each area given, multiply by 1.5 and sum them all. But wait, that's the same as the rectangle method, not the midpoint rule. Because the midpoint rule is for integration, which is like summing rectangles whose heights are determined by the function at their midpoints.

Wait, maybe the question is implying that each cross-sectional area is measured at the midpoint of each interval, and the intervals are spaced 1.5 cm apart. So, for example, the first data point (0) is at x=0 cm, which is the midpoint of the first slice. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because the next point is at 1.5 cm, which would be the midpoint of the next slice.

Wait, maybe the data points are the midpoints. Let's see: the liver is 15 cm long. If we have 10 intervals, each 1.5 cm, then the midpoints would be at 0.75 cm, 2.25 cm, ... up to 14.25 cm. But the data given starts at 0, which is not 0.75. So that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the data points are taken at the ends of each slice, so the Midpoint Rule would require us to evaluate the area in the middle of each slice. But since we don't have those values, perhaps the problem is intended to be approximated by taking the average of the given areas or something else.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it step by step.

The formula for the Midpoint Rule when approximating the integral is:

Integral ≈ Δx * (f(m1) + f(m2) + ... + f(mn)), where m_i are the midpoints.

So, in this problem, the integral from 0 to 15 cm of A(x) dx, which gives volume.

We have 10 intervals (since 15/1.5 =10), so n=10. Each interval has a midpoint at (x_i + x_{i+1})/2.

But the areas given are at x=0, 1.5, 3.0, ...,15 cm. So these are the endpoints of the intervals, not the midpoints. So, in this case, the given areas are at the endpoints, but the Midpoint Rule requires the areas at the midpoints.

Hmm, but the problem states that the cross-sectional areas are given as 0,18,58,... So perhaps the data points are at the midpoints of each interval. Because the number of intervals is 10, so the midpoints would be at 0.75, 2.25,...,14.25 cm. But the data points given are at 0,1.5,...,15 cm. So that can't be.

Wait, maybe the data points are at the midpoints of slices that are 1.5 cm in thickness. So each slice is 1.5 cm, and the area is measured in the middle of the slice. Then, the total number of slices would be 15 cm /1.5 cm =10 slices, so 10 data points. But the given data has 11 points, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the data points are endpoints, but for the Midpoint Rule, we can only use the inner points. Because the first and last points are at the ends, so we can't have midpoints beyond that.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think differently.

An alternative approach: Maybe the problem is using the Midpoint Rule with the given data as the midpoints. But that would require that the number of data points is equal to the number of intervals, but we have 11, which is one more than 10. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the Trapezoidal Rule, but the question says to use the Midpoint Rule.

Wait, perhaps the way to proceed is to consider each cross-sectional area as representing the area at the midpoint of a 1.5 cm slice, except for the first and last points, which are zero.

Wait, but the first and last areas are zero, which would imply that the organ starts and ends at those points. So perhaps each of the given areas (except the first and last) corresponds to the midpoint of a slice.

Wait, but the given data has 11 points, which would imply 10 intervals, each 1.5 cm, starting at 0, 1.5,...,15 cm. So perhaps each area represents the midpoint of each interval.

Wait, no, because the midpoint of the interval between x=0 and x=1.5 is at 0.75 cm, not 0 or 1.5.

So perhaps the problem has the cross-sectional areas taken at the midpoints of 1.5 cm slices. So the midpoints would be at 0.75, 2.25, etc. But the data given doesn't start at 0.75. The first data point is 0.

Hmm, maybe the first slice is from 0 to 1.5 cm, and the area is taken at 0.75 cm. The next slice is from 1.5 to 3.0 cm, area at 2.25 cm, etc. So the given areas are at 0,1.5,3,...,15 cm, but in reality, the areas should be at 0.75,2.25,...,14.25 cm.

Wait, but that's not the case here. The given areas are at 0,1.5,...,15 cm. So perhaps the problem is using the data points as the midpoints, which would mean that each slice is 1.5 cm, and the area is measured at the center of each slice.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to ignore the endpoints (the first and last zero) and use the remaining areas as the midpoints for each slice.

Wait, the number of areas is 11, but the liver is 15 cm long, spaced 1.5 cm apart, meaning 10 intervals. So perhaps the first area (0) is at 0 cm, which is the start, and the next area (18) is at 1.5 cm, which is the first midpoint. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because 1.5 would be the end of the first interval.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should proceed with the calculation as if each given area (excluding the first and last) is a midpoint, and each slice is 1.5 cm thick. So, for example, the first non-zero area is 18, which would be the midpoint of the first slice (from 0 to 1.5 cm), but that's at 0.75 cm, not 1.5 cm.

Alternatively, perhaps the slices are 3 cm thick, but that doesn't fit with the 1.5 cm spacing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the given data as the midpoints, so each slice is 1.5 cm, and the area is given at each midpoint, which would be 0.75, 2.25, etc.

Wait, but the data has 11 points, which would be 10 intervals. So perhaps the correct approach is to take the average of each pair of consecutive areas as the midpoint value.

No, that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use all the given areas except the first and last zero, and apply the Midpoint Rule with 10 intervals, each of width 1.5 cm.

Wait, the Midpoint Rule would sum the areas at the midpoints, and each area is multiplied by the width. So the formula would be Volume ≈ Δx * (A1 + A2 + ... + An), where each Ai is the area at the midpoint of each interval.

But in this case, the given data includes 11 points. So perhaps the way to handle it is to ignore the first and last zero, and use the remaining 9 areas as the midpoints for 10 intervals, but that doesn't add up.

Wait, no, 11 data points, 10 intervals. So perhaps each interval has a midpoint where an area is given. But the given data includes 11 areas, which can't correspond to 10 midpoints.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try to outline the steps.

1. The liver is 15 cm long, divided into cross-sections spaced 1.5 cm apart. So the positions are at 0, 1.5, 3.0, ...,15 cm.

2. The cross-sectional areas are given at each of these positions.

3. To compute the volume using the Midpoint Rule, we need to approximate the integral of A(x) from 0 to 15 cm.

4. The Midpoint Rule for n intervals (each of width Δx) is: Volume ≈ Δx * (A(m1) + A(m2) + ... + A(mn)), where mi are the midpoints of each interval.

5. Since the given data points are at the ends of the intervals, not the midpoints, the problem arises of what values to use for A(mi).

Wait, but the problem states that the cross-sectional views are spaced 1.5 cm apart, which suggests that each cross-section is taken at each 1.5 cm increment. So the areas are known at each 1.5 cm position. But to use the Midpoint Rule, we need areas at the midpoints of each interval, which are at 0.75, 2.25, etc. Since we don't have those, perhaps the problem expects us to use the given areas as if they were at the midpoints. But that would require that the number of intervals equals the number of given areas, which isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the given data as the midpoints. So for example, the first area (0) is at the midpoint of a slice that's before the 0 cm position, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use all the given areas except the first and last zero, treating each as the midpoint of a 1.5 cm interval. So the number of intervals would be 9, since there are 9 non-zero areas (18,58,...,39), but that doesn't fit because 15 cm /1.5 cm per interval would give 10 intervals.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to proceed with the assumption that the given areas are at the midpoints of each 1.5 cm interval, and calculate accordingly.

But wait, the given areas are 11, which would imply 10 intervals. So perhaps each area corresponds to a midpoint of each interval.

So, the midpoints would be at 0.75, 2.25, 3.75, etc., up to 14.25 cm. But the given data points are at 0,1.5,3,...,15 cm. So perhaps the areas given at 1.5 cm, 3.0 cm, etc., are actually the midpoints of 3.0 cm intervals? But that doesn't fit with the 1.5 cm spacing.

Alternatively, perhaps the way to handle this is to pair the areas and calculate accordingly. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by treating each given area as the area at the midpoint of a 1.5 cm slice, and then summing them all.

Wait, let me try that approach. So each area is at the midpoint of a 1.5 cm slice, so each contributes 1.5 cm * area. So the total volume would be 1.5 * (sum of all areas).

Wait, but the areas start and end with zero, so that would be 11 areas, each contributing 1.5 * area. Let's compute that.

Sum = 0 +18 +58 +79 +94 +106 +117 +128 +63 +39 +0 = Let me add them step by step.

18 +58 =76; 76+79=155; 155+94=249; 249+106=355; 355+117=472; 472+128=600; 600+63=663; 663+39=702.

So sum is 702.

Volume would be 1.5 *702 = 1053 cm³.

But looking at the options, option J is 1050, which is close. But wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here by including all areas, including the first and last zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the Midpoint Rule requires that we don't include the endpoints, so we use only the inner points as midpoints.

Wait, if the first and last points are endpoints, then the midpoints would be from the first interval's midpoint to the last interval's midpoint. So in a 10-interval setup, you have 10 midpoints, which would correspond to the 10 inner data points (excluding the first and last zero).

Wait, but the given data has 11 points, so excluding the first and last zero, we have 9 points. That doesn't fit 10 midpoints.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, let me think again. The Midpoint Rule for n intervals (each of width Δx) uses n midpoint samples.

In this case, the liver is 15 cm, and each cross-section is spaced 1.5 cm apart, so n=10 intervals. Therefore, the Midpoint Rule would require 10 samples at the midpoints of each interval.

But the given data includes 11 samples, including the endpoints. So perhaps the correct approach is to take the 10 inner samples as the midpoints. That is, exclude the first and last zero, and take the remaining 9 as midpoints, but then we're missing one. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use all 11 data points as midpoints, but that would require 11 intervals, each of width (15 cm)/11 ≈1.36 cm. But the problem states that the spacing is 1.5 cm, so that can't be.

This is getting really confusing. Maybe
