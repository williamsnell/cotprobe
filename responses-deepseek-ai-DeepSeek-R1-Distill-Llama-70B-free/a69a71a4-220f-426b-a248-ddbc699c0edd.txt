Okay, so I've got this question about Erich Fromm and his ideas on society preventing people from realizing their true nature. The question is asking which response to societal demands allows a person to achieve that true nature, which is being loving, creative, and productive.

First, I need to remember what Fromm's theories are about. Fromm was a psychoanalyst and social psychologist, and I think he talked a lot about human nature and society. I recall he wrote "The Art of Loving" and "Escape from Freedom." In his work, he discussed different character orientations, right? Like different ways people relate to the world.

From what I remember, Fromm identified several types of orientations, like receptive, exploitative, hoarding, marketing, and productive. Each of these represents how people interact with the world in terms of getting what they need, especially things like love and material goods.

The question is about which of these orientations allows a person to realize their true nature. So, the true nature is being loving, creative, and productive. Fromm probably saw one of these orientations as the healthy or ideal one.

Let me think about each option. The options are labeled A to J, each with a different orientation. The correct answer is likely the one that aligns with being productive in a healthy way.

Option A: Authoritative. That sounds more like a controlling type, maybe not the positive one.

Option B: Productive. That seems like a good candidate because the term itself suggests creating and producing, which ties into creativity and productivity.

Option C: Destructive. That's probably the opposite, leading to harm rather than good.

Option D: Exploitative. That's taking without giving, so that wouldn't align with being loving.

Option E: Manipulative. Again, that's using others for gain, not positive.

Option F: Marketing. I think Fromm talked about the marketing orientation as people seeing themselves as commodities, which is more about superficiality and not genuine.

Option G: Hoarding. That's keeping things to oneself, not sharing, which doesn't fit with being loving.

Option H: Submissive. That's about giving in, maybe not taking control in a healthy way.

Option I: Controlling. Similar to authoritative, probably not the ideal.

Option J: Receptive. This is about being open to receive, which might be part of a healthy approach, but I think the productive orientation is the one Fromm emphasized as the ideal.

So, putting it together, Fromm's productive orientation is about creating and contributing, which allows people to express their true nature. Therefore, the answer should be option B.

The correct answer is B. Fromm's productive orientation is the healthy response that aligns with realizing one's true nature as loving, creative, and productive.

Answer: B
