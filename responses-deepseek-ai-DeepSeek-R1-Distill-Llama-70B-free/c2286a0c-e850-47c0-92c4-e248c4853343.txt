Alright, I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this question about what happens to energy when water changes to steam. Okay, let's break it down step by step.

The question is: "When water changes to steam, energy is..." and there are several options to choose from. I remember from my science classes that when a substance changes phase, like from liquid to gas, energy is involved. But wait, what exactly happens?

So, water turning into steam is a phase change from liquid to gas. I think phase changes involve either absorbing or releasing energy. Let me recall: when water evaporates or boils, it turns into vapor, which is steam. That process requires energy because the molecules need to gain enough energy to break free from the liquid's surface tension and turn into gas. 

So, in this process, where does that energy come from? I remember that when a substance goes from a lower energy state to a higher one, it absorbs energy. For example, melting ice (solid to liquid) requires energy. Similarly, vaporization (liquid to gas) also needs energy. So, when water becomes steam, it must be absorbing energy.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one matches this. Option A says energy is converted into matter. Hmm, that doesn't sound right because energy and matter are different things, and the question is about energy transfer, not conversion to matter. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B: changed to a different form. That's a possibility. Because energy can change forms, like electrical to heat. But in this case, when water heats up, the energy is being absorbed as heat, which is a form of energy. So maybe B is correct, but I'm not sure yet.

Option C: transferred to the surrounding environment. Wait, when water turns to steam, it's absorbing energy, so the environment would be losing energy. Or wait, no, if the water is heating up from the surroundings, then the surroundings lose energy as they transfer it to the water. So maybe C is about the environment losing energy, but the question is about where the energy goes. So C says the energy is transferred to the surrounding, which would mean the steam is losing energy to the environment. But when water becomes steam, it's gaining energy, so C doesn't seem right.

Option D: created within the water. No, energy can't be created, only transferred or transformed. So D is incorrect because of the law of conservation of energy.

Option E: both absorbed and released simultaneously. That doesn't sound right here. Phase change might involve absorbing energy, but not both at the same time. Unless in a more complex scenario, but for this question, I think E is not correct.

Option F: conserved as the phase change occurs. Well, yes, because energy is conserved overall. But the question is about what happens to the energy when water changes to steam. So while conservation is true, the answer might be more specific about the direction. But F is a possible contender because it's a correct statement about energy conservation.

Option G: not involved in the process. That can't be right because we know energy is definitely involved in phase changes.

Option H: absorbed by the water. Yes, that's what I was thinking earlier. When water becomes steam, it absorbs energy from the surroundings, which increases its temperature and allows the phase change. So H seems correct.

Option I: released by the water. That would be the opposite. For example, when steam condenses back to water, it releases energy. But when water turns to steam, it's absorbing, not releasing. So I is incorrect.

Option J: destroyed as the phase change occurs. No, energy isn't destroyed. It's transformed or transferred, but not destroyed, thanks to the conservation law.

So, putting it all together. The correct answer should be H: absorbed by the water. Because when water changes to steam, it absorbs energy. Let me just double-check: phase change from liquid to gas requires energy input, which the water absorbs. So yeah, H is the right choice.

When water changes to steam, it undergoes a phase change from liquid to gas. This process requires energy because the water molecules need to gain enough energy to break free from the liquid's surface tension and turn into vapor. Specifically, the energy is absorbed by the water, typically in the form of heat, to increase the molecules' kinetic energy and allow the phase transition.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. Energy is not converted into matter; this violates the principle of conservation of energy.
- **B**: Partially correct but less specific. While energy can change forms, the question focuses on the direction of energy transfer.
- **C**: Incorrect. Energy is not transferred to the surroundings; it is absorbed by the water.
- **D**: Incorrect. Energy cannot be created; it is only transferred or transformed.
- **E**: Incorrect. The process does not involve simultaneous absorption and release of energy.
- **F**: True but not specific. While energy is conserved, the question asks about the energy's role in the phase change.
- **G**: Incorrect. Energy is clearly involved in the process.
- **H**: Correct. Energy is absorbed by the water to facilitate the phase change.
- **I**: Incorrect. Energy is not released during vaporization; it is absorbed.
- **J**: Incorrect. Energy is not destroyed; it is conserved.

The correct answer is **H: absorbed by the water**, as energy is required for the phase change from liquid to gas.
