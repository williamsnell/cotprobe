Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the density of a tropocollagen molecule. Hmm, I remember that density is mass divided by volume, right? So I'll need to find both the mass and the volume of this molecule.

The problem says the molecule is a tightly coiled cylinder, 2800 Å long and 14 Å in diameter. Oh wait, but wait—angstroms. I think 1 Å is 1e-8 cm. So I'll need to convert those measurements into centimeters to get the volume in cm³ because density is usually in g/cm³.

So first, the volume. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is πr²h. The radius is half the diameter, so 14/2 =7 Å. Let's convert that to cm. 7 Å is 7e-8 cm. So radius squared is (7e-8)^2. Multiply by π and the height (which is 2800 Å, so 2800e-8 cm).

Wait, calculating that: 7e-8 cm is 0.00000007 cm. Squared is (7e-8)^2 = 49e-16 cm². Multiply by π, which is about 3.1416, so 49e-16 *3.1416 ≈ 153.938e-16 cm². Then multiply by the height, 2800e-8 cm. So 153.938e-16 * 2800e-8 = let's see, 153.938 * 2800 is approximately 153.938 * 2.8e3 = let's compute that. 153.938 * 2.8 = about 431.0264, so times 1e3 is 431,026.4, and then times 1e-24 (since 1e-16 * 1e-8 = 1e-24). So 431,026.4e-24 cm³. Wait, no, wait: Wait, 1e-16 times 1e-8 is 1e-24. So 153.938e-16 * 2800e-8 = (153.938 *2800) * 1e-24. Let me compute 153.938 * 2800. Let's see, 153 *2800 is 153*2.8e3 = 428,400. Then 0.938*2800= approx 2624. So total is about 428400 +2624= 431,024. So 431024e-24 cm³, which is 4.31024e-20 cm³. Wait, because 431024e-24 is 4.31024e5 * 1e-24 =4.31024e-19 cm³? Wait no, wait: 431,024 is 4.31024e5. So 4.31024e5 * 1e-24 = 4.31024e-19 cm³? Wait, no, 1e5 *1e-24 is 1e-19. So yes, 4.31024e5 *1e-24 is 4.31024e-19 cm³. So the volume is approximately 4.31e-19 cm³.

Wait no, wait, let me recheck the calculations because I might be making a mistake here. Let me compute it step by step.

Volume = π * r² * h.

r =7 Å = 7e-8 cm.

r squared is (7e-8)^2 =49e-16 cm².

Multiply by π: 49e-16 * π ≈ 49 *3.1416e-16 ≈ 153.938e-16 cm².

Multiply by h, which is 2800e-8 cm: 153.938e-16 *2800e-8.

153.938 *2800 = let's compute that.

153.938 * 2800: 153.938 *28 *100.

153.938 *28: 153 *28 is 4284. 0.938 *28 is about 26.264. So total is 4284 +26.264=4310.264. Multiply by 100 gives 431026.4.

So the product is 431026.4e-24 cm³. Because 1e-16 *1e-8 =1e-24.

So 431,026.4e-24 cm³ is equal to 4.310264e-20 cm³ because 431026.4e-24 =4.310264e5 *1e-24 =4.310264e-19? Wait, no: 431,026.4 divided by 1e24 is 4.310264e-20. Because 431,026.4 is 4.310264e5, so 4.310264e5 *1e-24 =4.310264e-19? Wait, no. Let me think in exponents.

Wait, 431,026.4e-24 is 4.310264e5 * 1e-24 = 4.310264e-19. Because 4.310264e5 is 4.310264 *1e5, multiplied by 1e-24 gives 4.310264 *1e-19. Yes.

So volume is approximately 4.31e-19 cm³.

Now, the mass. The molecule has three polypeptide chains each with 1000 amino acid residues. So total amino acids are 3*1000=3000.

Each amino acid has a molar mass. I think the average molar mass of an amino acid is about 120 g/mol. Wait, some are heavier, some lighter, but average around 120. So 3000 amino acids would be 3000 * 120 g/mol.

Wait, but wait, the molar mass calculation. Hmm.

So 3 chains * 1000 residues =3000 residues. Each residue's molar mass is about 120 g/mol. So total molar mass is 3000 * 120 = 360,000 g/mol. Wait, no, that's 360,000 g/mol. So that's the molar mass (M) of the molecule: 360,000 g/mol.

But wait, wait, but wait. Each amino acid is about 120 g/mol, but when you form a peptide bond, you lose water. So the actual molar mass per residue is a bit less. But I think in such problems, they often approximate each residue as 120 g/mol. So I'll proceed with that.

So the molar mass M is 3000 * 120 = 360,000 g/mol.

But wait, wait, wait: Molar mass is in g/mol, but the mass of the molecule is in grams. So how do I find the mass of the molecule?

I think I'm confusing molar mass and the actual mass. The molar mass is 360,000 g per mole. So the mass of one molecule is (360,000 g/mol) divided by Avogadro's number (N_A=6.022e23 molecules/mol).

So mass m = M / N_A = 360,000 g/mol / 6.022e23 molecules/mol.

So m = (360,000 / 6.022e23) grams.

Calculating that: 360,000 is 3.6e5. So 3.6e5 /6.022e23 = (3.6 /6.022) * 1e-18.

3.6 divided by 6.022 is approximately 0.5977. So 0.5977e-18 grams per molecule.

Wait, 0.5977e-18 grams is 5.977e-19 grams.

So the mass of the molecule is approximately 5.977e-19 grams.

Now, density is mass/volume. So density = m / V.

m is 5.977e-19 g, V is 4.310e-19 cm³.

So density = (5.977e-19) / (4.310e-19) = approximately 1.387 g/cm³.

Wait, let me compute that exactly. 5.977 divided by 4.310.

Hmm, 4.310 times 1.387 is approximately 5.977.

Wait, 4.310 *1.38 = ?

4 *1.38 =5.52; 0.310*1.38=0.4278. Total is 5.52 +0.4278=5.9478. Close to 5.977. So maybe 1.387.

So the density is approximately 1.39 g/cm³.

Looking at the options, option B is 1.39 g/cm³.

To calculate the density of the tropocollagen molecule, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Density} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the Volume
The molecule is modeled as a cylinder with a length \( h = 2800 \, \text{Å} \) and diameter \( d = 14 \, \text{Å} \). The radius is \( r = \frac{d}{2} = 7 \, \text{Å} \). Converting to centimeters:

\[
r = 7 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{cm}, \quad h = 2800 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{cm}
\]

The volume of a cylinder is given by:

\[
V = \pi r^2 h
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
r^2 = (7 \times 10^{-8})^2 = 49 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{cm}^2
\]

\[
V = \pi \times 49 \times 10^{-16} \times 2800 \times 10^{-8}
\]

\[
V = 3.1416 \times 49 \times 2800 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{cm}^3
\]

\[
V \approx 4.31 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{cm}^3
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Mass
The molecule contains three polypeptide chains, each with 1000 amino acid residues. Thus, the total number of amino acids is:

\[
3 \times 1000 = 3000 \, \text{residues}
\]

The average molar mass of an amino acid is approximately \( 120 \, \text{g/mol} \). Therefore, the molar mass of the molecule is:

\[
M = 3000 \times 120 = 360,000 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

The mass of a single molecule is:

\[
m = \frac{M}{N_A} = \frac{360,000}{6.022 \times 10^{23}} \, \text{g}
\]

\[
m \approx 5.977 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{g}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Density
The density is:

\[
\text{Density} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{5.977 \times 10^{-19}}{4.31 \times 10^{-19}}
\]

\[
\text{Density} \approx 1.39 \, \text{g/cm}^3
\]

### Final Answer
The density of the tropocollagen molecule is approximately **1.39 g/cm³**, which corresponds to option **B**.
