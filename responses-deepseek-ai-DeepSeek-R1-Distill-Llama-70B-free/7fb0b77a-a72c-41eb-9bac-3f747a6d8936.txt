Okay, so I've got this problem in front of me, and I need to find all the zeros of the polynomial x² + 1 in Z_2. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should remember what Z_2 is. Z_2 is the finite field with two elements, which are 0 and 1. So the possible elements to test as roots are just 0 and 1.

The polynomial given is x squared plus 1. So I need to plug in each element of Z_2 into this polynomial and see if it evaluates to zero.

Let's start with x = 0. Plugging in, I get (0)^2 + 1. That's 0 + 1, which equals 1. But in Z_2, 1 is not equal to 0, so 0 is not a root.

Next, let's try x = 1. Plugging in, (1)^2 + 1 is 1 + 1, which is 2. But wait, in Z_2, 2 is equivalent to 0 because 2 mod 2 is 0. So that means when x is 1, the polynomial equals 0. So 1 is a root.

Wait, so only x=1 is a root? That seems to be the case. But wait, in Z_2, the polynomial is x² + 1. Let me double-check my calculations.

When x=0: 0² +1 = 1 mod 2 is 1, which isn't zero. So no. When x=1: 1² +1 = 2 mod 2 is 0. So yes, that's a zero.

So the polynomial has one zero in Z_2, which is x=1.

Looking at the options, let's see. The question asks for all zeros, so the correct choice should include 1. Let's check the options:

Option H is 1. So that's the one. Other options include 0, which isn't a root, so options like A, E, G can be eliminated. Option C is none, which isn't correct because 1 is a root. So the correct answer should be H.

To find all zeros of the polynomial \(x^2 + 1\) in the finite field \(\mathbb{Z}_2\), we evaluate the polynomial at each element of \(\mathbb{Z}_2\), which consists of the elements \(0\) and \(1\).

1. For \(x = 0\):  
   \[
   0^2 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 \neq 0 \quad \text{(in } \mathbb{Z}_2\text{)}.
   \]  
   Thus, \(x = 0\) is not a root.

2. For \(x = 1\):  
   \[
   1^2 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \equiv 0 \quad \text{(in } \mathbb{Z}_2\text{)}.
   \]  
   Thus, \(x = 1\) is a root.

Therefore, the only zero of the polynomial \(x^2 + 1\) in \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) is \(x = 1\).

From the given options, the correct choice is **H: 1**.
