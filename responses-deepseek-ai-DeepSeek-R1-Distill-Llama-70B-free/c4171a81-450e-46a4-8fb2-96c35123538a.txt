Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again: I need to find the minimum value of the expression x + 4z, where the function is defined in R^3, and the constraint is x² + y² + z² ≤ 2. The options are from A to J, each with different square roots, some negative.

Hmm, so the function to minimize is f(x,y,z) = x + 4z. The constraint is the sphere equation x² + y² + z² ≤ 2. Wait, but when looking for minima or maxima under such constraints, especially when it's an inequality, I think the extrema occur on the boundary. So maybe I should consider the case where x² + y² + z² = 2, because that's where the extremal values are likely to be.

I remember something about using Lagrange multipliers for optimization under constraints. Oh right, that's the method. So the idea is to find the points where the gradient of f is parallel to the gradient of the constraint function g(x,y,z) = x² + y² + z² - 2.

Let me set that up. The gradients:

∇f = [df/dx, df/dy, df/dz] = [1, 0, 4]
∇g = [dg/dx, dg/dy, dg/dz] = [2x, 2y, 2z]

According to Lagrange multipliers, ∇f = λ∇g, where λ is the multiplier. So each component must satisfy:

1 = λ * 2x  --> equation 1
0 = λ * 2y  --> equation 2
4 = λ * 2z  --> equation 3

From equation 2: 0 = 2λ y. So either λ=0 or y=0. But if λ were 0, then equation 1 would give 1=0, which is impossible. So y must be 0.

Now, from equations 1 and 3, let's solve for x and z in terms of λ.

Equation 1: 1 = 2λx → x = 1/(2λ)
Equation 3: 4 = 2λz → z = 4/(2λ) = 2/λ

So now, I have x and z in terms of λ. I can plug these into the constraint equation x² + y² + z² =2. Since y is 0, it simplifies to x² + z² = 2.

Substituting x and z:

(1/(2λ))² + (2/λ)² = 2
= 1/(4λ²) + 4/(λ²) = 2
Combine terms: (1/(4λ²)) + (16/(4λ²)) )= (17)/(4λ²) ) =2
So 17/(4λ²) = 2 → 4λ² =17/2 → λ² =17/(8) → λ = sqrt(17/8) or λ = -sqrt(17/8).

Wait, because lambda could be positive or negative. Let me think. So λ can have two values, positive and negative. But let's see how that affects x and z.

Case 1: λ positive.

Then x = 1/(2λ) → positive, since λ is positive.
z = 2/λ → positive.

So the function f = x +4z would be positive in this case.

Case 2: λ negative.

Then x = 1/(2λ) → negative, because λ is negative.
z = 2/λ → negative.

So f = x +4z would be negative, which is what we're looking for since we're trying to find the minimum value. So the minimum occurs when λ is negative.

So let's compute for λ negative. Let me compute λ as -sqrt(17/(8)).

Wait, let me compute lambda correctly. Since λ squared is 17/8, lambda is sqrt(17/8) or negative sqrt(17/8). So let's take lambda as negative.

So lambda = -sqrt(17/(8)).

Then x = 1/(2λ) = 1/(2*(-sqrt(17/8))) = -1/(2*sqrt(17/8)).

Similarly, z = 2/λ = 2/(-sqrt(17/8)) )= -2/sqrt(17/8).

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute x and z in terms of lambda, but perhaps I should rationalize the denominators.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I can find x and z in terms of each other.

Wait, let me think again about the expressions.

From equation 1: x = 1/(2λ)
From equation 3: z = 2/λ

So z = 4x. Because since z = 2/λ, and x is 1/(2λ), so z = 4*(1/(2λ)) )= 4x.

So z = 4x.

Now, substituting into the constraint equation x² + z² =2.

x² + (4x)^2 =2 → x² +16x² =2 →17x²=2 →x² =2/17 →x=±sqrt(2/17).

Wait, but earlier we found that when lambda is negative, x is negative. So x would be negative.

So x = -sqrt(2/17).

Then, z=4x=4*(-sqrt(2/17)) )= -4*sqrt(2/17).

So now, the function f =x +4z = x +4*(4x) =x +16x=17x.

Wait, because z=4x, so 4z=16x. So f=x +16x=17x.

Since x is negative, f=17x is negative.

So f=17*(-sqrt(2/17)) )= -17*sqrt(2/17) = -sqrt( (17^2) * 2 /17 )= -sqrt(34).

Wait, let me compute that step again.

17*sqrt(2/17) is equal to sqrt( (17)^2 * 2 /17 ) because 17 is sqrt(17^2), so when I multiply sqrt(a) by sqrt(b), it's sqrt(ab).

So 17 * sqrt(2/17) = sqrt( (17^2) * (2/17) ) = sqrt( 17 *2 )=sqrt(34).

Wait, so 17x where x is -sqrt(2/17) is 17*(-sqrt(2/17)) = -sqrt(34).

So the minimum value is -sqrt(34).

Looking at the options, option E is -sqrt(34). So the answer should be E.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra. Let me double-check.

Wait, f = x +4z.

With z=4x, so 4z =16x. So f= x +16x=17x.

Yes.

x= -sqrt(2/17), so 17x=17*(-sqrt(2/17))= -sqrt( (17)^2 * 2/17 )= -sqrt(34). Correct.

So the answer is E.

To find the minimum value of the expression \( f(x, y, z) = x + 4z \) subject to the constraint \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \leq 2 \), we use the method of Lagrange multipliers. The extrema occur on the boundary of the constraint, where \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2 \).

The gradients of the function and the constraint are:
\[
\nabla f = [1, 0, 4], \quad \nabla g = [2x, 2y, 2z].
\]
Setting \( \nabla f = \lambda \nabla g \), we get the system of equations:
\[
1 = \lambda (2x), \quad 0 = \lambda (2y), \quad 4 = \lambda (2z).
\]
From \( 0 = \lambda (2y) \), either \( \lambda = 0 \) or \( y = 0 \). Since \( \lambda = 0 \) leads to a contradiction in the first equation, we have \( y = 0 \).

From \( 1 = \lambda (2x) \) and \( 4 = \lambda (2z) \), we solve for \( x \) and \( z \) in terms of \( \lambda \):
\[
x = \frac{1}{2\lambda}, \quad z = \frac{2}{\lambda}.
\]
Substituting \( x \) and \( z \) into the constraint \( x^2 + z^2 = 2 \):
\[
\left(\frac{1}{2\lambda}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{2}{\lambda}\right)^2 = 2.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\frac{1}{4\lambda^2} + \frac{4}{\lambda^2} = 2 \implies \frac{17}{4\lambda^2} = 2 \implies \lambda^2 = \frac{17}{8} \implies \lambda = \pm \sqrt{\frac{17}{8}}.
\]

For \( \lambda > 0 \), \( x \) and \( z \) are positive, leading to a positive value of \( f(x, z) = x + 4z \). For \( \lambda < 0 \), \( x \) and \( z \) are negative, leading to a negative value of \( f(x, z) \). Since we seek the minimum value, we take \( \lambda = -\sqrt{\frac{17}{8}} \).

Substituting \( \lambda = -\sqrt{\frac{17}{8}} \) into \( x \) and \( z \):
\[
x = -\frac{1}{2\sqrt{\frac{17}{8}}} = -\sqrt{\frac{2}{17}}, \quad z = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{\frac{17}{8}}} = -4\sqrt{\frac{2}{17}}.
\]
The function becomes:
\[
f(x, z) = x + 4z = -\sqrt{\frac{2}{17}} + 4\left(-4\sqrt{\frac{2}{17}}\right) = -17\sqrt{\frac{2}{17}} = -\sqrt{34}.
\]

Thus, the minimum value of the expression is \( -\sqrt{34} \), which corresponds to option **E**.
