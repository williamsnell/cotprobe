Okay, so I have this problem here about Owens Company accepting a draft, and I need to find out the proceeds after discounting. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says Owens Company accepted a 90-day sight draft for $560 drawn by Watts Bros. Then, Watts Bros. discounted the draft 34 days before the due date at a 6% interest rate. I need to find the proceeds.

Wait, so what's a sight draft? From what I remember, a sight draft is like a bill that's payable when it's presented, but in some cases, it might have a term. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no, a sight draft is payable on demand, but in this case, the problem says it's a 90-day sight draft. That might mean it's a usance draft with 90 days until due. Or maybe it's a time draft with a 90-day term. Oh, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, I think I remember that a sight draft is usually due on presentation, but sometimes it's called a 90-day sight draft, which actually would mean it's a time draft with a 90-day maturity. So when Owens accepts it, they have 90 days to pay. So the due date is 90 days from the date of acceptance.

Now, Watts Bros. had the draft discounted 34 days before the due date. So the draft is being discounted before it's due. That makes sense because discounting usually happens before maturity.

So the face value is $560, the discount rate is 6%, and the time is 34 days before the due date. Wait, but the total time is 90 days, so the discount period is 34 days. So how do I calculate the discount?

Right, the formula for the discount is: 

Discount = (Face Value × Rate × Time) / 360

And then the proceeds would be the face value minus the discount.

So let me plug in the numbers. Face value is $560, rate is 6% or 0.06, and time is 34 days.

Discount = (560 * 0.06 * 34) / 360

Let me compute that. Let's see, 560 times 0.06 is 33.6. 33.6 multiplied by 34 is... let me calculate that. 33.6 * 34. 30 *34=1020, 3.6*34=122.4, so total is 1142.4. Then divide by 360: 1142.4 / 360.

Let me compute that division. 360 goes into 1142.4 how many times? 360 * 3 is 1080, subtract that from 1142.4, leaves 62.4. 62.4 divided by 360 is 0.173333... So total is 3.173333... So the discount is 3.173333... dollars?

Wait, wait, wait, that can't be right. Because 560 * 0.06 is 33.6. 33.6 is the annual interest. But since it's for 34 days, it's a fraction of a year. So 34/360 of that.

Wait, maybe I should do it differently. Let me break it down again. Face value is 560. So the discount is (560 * 0.06 * (34/360)).

So 0.06 * (34/360) = 0.06 * 0.094444... Let me compute that: 0.06 * 0.094444 is approximately 0.00566666.

Then 560 * 0.00566666 is 560 * 0.00566666. Let's compute. 560 * 0.005 is 2.8. 560 * 0.00066666 is about 0.373333. So total discount is approximately 2.8 + 0.373333 = 3.173333.

So the discount is about $3.17. So the proceeds would be 560 minus 3.17, which is $556.83.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation because I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 0.06 * 34 = 2.04. Then 2.04 divided by 360 is 0.00566666. Multiply by 560: 560 * 0.00566666. 

Wait, 560 * 0.005 is 2.8, and 0.00066666*560 is 0.373333. So 2.8 + 0.373333 equals 3.173333. So that's correct.

So the discount is $3.17, so the proceeds are 560 - 3.17 = 556.83.

Looking at the options, H is $556.83, which should be the correct answer. Let me check the options again:

H: $556.83.

Yes, that's the one.

To determine the proceeds from discounting the draft, we use the formula for the discount:

\[
\text{Discount} = \frac{\text{Face Value} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}}{360}
\]

Here, the face value is $560, the rate is 6% (or 0.06), and the time is 34 days. Plugging in the values:

\[
\text{Discount} = \frac{560 \times 0.06 \times 34}{360}
\]

First, calculate \( 560 \times 0.06 = 33.6 \). Then, \( 33.6 \times 34 = 1142.4 \). Finally, divide by 360:

\[
\text{Discount} = \frac{1142.4}{360} \approx 3.1733
\]

The discount is approximately $3.17. The proceeds are the face value minus the discount:

\[
\text{Proceeds} = 560 - 3.17 = 556.83
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**H: $556.83**
