Okay, so I've got this problem here about Mr. Torres and his stock dividends. Let me read it again. He owns 350 shares of Krescostock. The stock pays a quarterly dividend of $1.20 per share, and there's an extra year-end dividend of $0.30 per share. I need to find his total income from the stock for the year.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I should calculate the regular dividends he receives each quarter and then add the extra year-end dividend.

Wait, quarterly means four times a year, right? So each quarter, he gets $1.20 per share. Since he has 350 shares, each quarterly dividend would be 350 * 1.20. Let me calculate that.

350 * 1.20 = let's see, 350 times 1 is 350, and 350 times 0.20 is 70. So 350 +70 = 420. So each quarter, he gets $420. Since there are four quarters, the regular dividends would be 4 * 420.

4 * 420 is 1,680. So that's $1,680 from the regular dividends.

Now, the extra year-end dividend is $0.30 per share. So for 350 shares, that's 350 * 0.30. Let me compute that. 0.3 times 350 is 105. So that's an extra $105 at the end of the year.

Wait, so the total income would be the sum of the regular dividends and the extra dividend. That would be 1,680 + 105. Let me add those up. 1,680 plus 100 is 1,780, and then plus 5 more is 1,785. So total income is $1,785.

Looking at the options, option H is $1,785. So the answer should be H.

The total income from the stock for the year is calculated by summing the regular quarterly dividends and the extra year-end dividend. 

1. **Regular Quarterly Dividends**:  
   - Quarterly dividend per share: $1.20  
   - Number of shares: 350  
   - Quarterly payment: \( 350 \times 1.20 = 420 \) dollars.  
   - Annual regular dividends: \( 4 \times 420 = 1,680 \) dollars.  

2. **Extra Year-End Dividend**:  
   - Year-end dividend per share: $0.30  
   - Total extra dividend: \( 350 \times 0.30 = 105 \) dollars.  

3. **Total Income**:  
   - Sum of regular and extra dividends: \( 1,680 + 105 = 1,785 \) dollars.  

The correct answer is **H: $1,785**.
