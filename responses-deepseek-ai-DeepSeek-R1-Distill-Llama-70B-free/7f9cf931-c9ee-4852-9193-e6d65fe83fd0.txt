Okay, so I've got this question about why the infrared absorption frequency of DCl is different from HCl. Hmm, I remember that IR spectroscopy has to do with molecular vibrations, right? So the absorption is related to the vibrational energy levels of the molecule.

Wait, the question is about the shift in frequency between HCl and DCl. I think when you have different isotopes, like hydrogen and deuterium, it affects the vibrational frequency. But why?

Oh right, the vibrational frequency depends on the mass of the atoms involved. Because deuterium is heavier than hydrogen, the reduced mass of the molecule changes. Reduced mass is like a concept in physics where when two masses are connected by a spring (like a bond here), the effective mass is a combination of both.

So the formula for vibrational frequency is something like sqrt(k/μ), where k is the force constant and μ is the reduced mass. If μ increases, the frequency decreases because sqrt(k/μ) gets smaller. So DCl, with heavier D, has a lower frequency than HCl. That makes sense because I've heard that deuterated compounds absorb at lower frequencies than their protonated counterparts.

Wait, but what about the other options? Let's see. Electronegativity differences wouldn't directly cause this shift. Both HCl and DCl have the same electronegativity between Cl and H/D. Ionization energy might be a bit different, but again, that's not directly tied to vibrational frequency.

Bond lengths—ah, bond length is related to the reduced mass too because the bond strength (force constant) and the masses affect the vibration. But wait, the bond length between H and Cl versus D and Cl—would that change? I think the bond length is slightly shorter for DCl because D is heavier, but the main factor for the frequency shift is the mass difference.

Wait, no, maybe the bond length isn't the main factor. Because the force constant k is actually similar for HCl and DCl since the bond strength doesn't change much with isotopes. So if k is roughly the same, the change in frequency comes from the change in reduced mass. So the correct reason is the difference in reduced mass.

Looking at the options, option I is reduced mass. So the answer should be I.

The infrared absorption frequency of a molecule is related to its vibrational energy levels, which depend on the reduced mass of the atoms involved in the bond. In the case of HCl and DCl, the primary difference is the mass of the hydrogen isotope (H vs. D). The vibrational frequency is determined by the formula:

\[
\text{Frequency} \propto \sqrt{\frac{k}{\mu}}
\]

where \( k \) is the force constant (similar for both HCl and DCl) and \( \mu \) is the reduced mass. Since deuterium is heavier than hydrogen, the reduced mass of DCl is greater than that of HCl. This results in a lower vibrational frequency for DCl compared to HCl.

Other factors, such as electronegativity, ionization energy, bond length, or dipole moment, do not directly explain the frequency shift. The key difference lies in the reduced mass of the molecules, which directly affects the vibrational frequency.

The correct answer is **I: reduced mass**.
