Question:

What do the results of studies with twins suggest about the influence of heredity on personality?

Options:

A: Heredity dictates personality completely, and the environment has no impact.
B: Identical twins raised apart will have completely different personalities due to environmental differences.
C: Personality traits are inherited in a fixed pattern, similar to physical traits like eye color.
D: Heredity determines intelligence, which in turn completely determines personality.
E: Heredity has no influence on personality.
F: Personalities are influenced only by peer interactions, not by heredity or family environment.
G: Fraternal twins have more similar personalities than identical twins due to shared environments.
H: Heredity provides a capacity for a wide range of behavior that may then be encouraged or sustained by the environment.
I: Environment solely determines personality traits.
J: Identical twins always have identical personalities.

Okay, so I've got this question about twin studies and their implications on the influence of heredity on personality. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking what twin studies suggest about heredity and personality. I remember that twin studies often compare identical twins (who share almost all their genes) with fraternal twins (who share about half their genes on average). By studying how similar each group is in certain traits, researchers can estimate the influence of genetics versus environment.

I think the key here is that identical twins tend to have very similar personalities, even when they're raised apart. That suggests a strong genetic component. But wait, it's not like they're exactly the same, right? So it's not that heredity dictates everything. The environment must play a role too.

Looking at the options:

Option A says heredity completely determines personality, no environment. That doesn't sound right because even if there's a genetic influence, the environment still affects personality. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B says identical twins raised apart have completely different personalities. No, I've heard that they show a lot of similarities, so B is probably wrong.

Option C: Personality traits are inherited like eye color. Eye color is a fixed trait, but personality is more complex. I don't think it's fixed in the same way. So C might not be correct.

Option D: Heredity determines intelligence, which determines personality. I'm not sure if intelligence is the only factor. There's more to personality than just intelligence, so D might be too narrow.

Option E: Heredity has no influence. No, because twin studies show similarities, so E is incorrect.

Option F: Only peer interactions matter. That ignores the genetic part, so F is wrong.

Option G: Fraternal twins have more similar personalities than identical. No, identical are more similar, so G is incorrect.

Option H: Heredity provides a capacity that environment influences. That sounds familiar. Like, genes set a range, and environment shapes where you fall within that range. So H makes sense.

Option I: Environment solely determines. No, twin studies show genetics do play a role, so I is wrong.

Option J: Identical twins always same. No, they are similar but not identical in personality, so J is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be H. Heredity provides a capacity that the environment then influences.

The results of twin studies suggest that heredity plays a significant role in shaping personality, but it is not the sole determinant. These studies, particularly those involving identical twins raised apart, show a high degree of similarity in personality traits, indicating a strong genetic influence. However, they also reveal that environmental factors contribute to individual differences, meaning personality is not entirely fixed by genetics. Instead, heredity provides a predisposition or capacity for certain traits, which can then be influenced by environmental factors.

- **A**: Incorrect. Heredity does not completely dictate personality; environment also plays a role.
- **B**: Incorrect. Identical twins raised apart often show significant similarities, not completely different personalities.
- **C**: Incorrect. Personality traits are more complex and influenced by both genes and environment, unlike fixed traits like eye color.
- **D**: Incorrect. Intelligence is not the sole determinant of personality.
- **E**: Incorrect. Twin studies demonstrate that heredity does influence personality.
- **F**: Incorrect. Personality is influenced by both heredity and environment, not just peer interactions.
- **G**: Incorrect. Identical twins generally have more similar personalities than fraternal twins.
- **H**: Correct. Heredity provides a genetic foundation, and the environment shapes how these traits manifest.
- **I**: Incorrect. Environment is not the sole determinant; heredity also plays a role.
- **J**: Incorrect. Identical twins are highly similar but not identical in personality.

Answer: H
