Okay, so I have this economics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about normal goods and what they always have. The options are A through J, each giving a different economic term. 

First, I need to remember what a normal good is. From what I recall, a normal good is a product where the demand increases when income increases. So, when people earn more money, they buy more of the good. This is in contrast to inferior goods, where demand decreases with higher income.

Now, the question is asking what characteristic a normal good always has. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Inelastic demand curve. Hmm, elasticity measures how responsive the quantity demanded is to a price change. I'm not sure if normal goods are always inelastic. Elasticity can vary; some normal goods might be elastic, others inelastic. So I don't think this is necessarily always true.

Option B: Upward sloping demand curve. Wait, no. The law of demand says that as price increases, quantity demanded decreases, so demand curves slope downward. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Positive income elasticity. Oh, right. Income elasticity of demand measures how responsive demand is to a change in income. For normal goods, since demand increases with income, the income elasticity should be positive. So C seems correct.

Option D: Elastic price elasticity. Elasticity in price refers to the responsiveness of quantity demanded to price changes. A good can be normal but have either elastic or inelastic price elasticity depending on the product. So this isn't necessarily always true.

Option E: Elastic demand curve. Like D, this depends on the specific good. Some normal goods might have elastic demand, others inelastic. So E isn't always the case.

Option F: Elastic supply curve. This is about supply, but the question is about demand characteristics of normal goods. So F doesn't seem relevant here.

Option G: Inelastic price elasticity. Again, this goes back to elasticity of demand, which doesn't have to be inelastic just because it's a normal good. So G isn't necessarily correct.

Option H: Downward sloping supply curve. Supply curves usually slope upward, not downward. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Negative cross elasticity. Cross elasticity refers to how two goods relate (substitutes or complements). This isn't directly related to being a normal good. So I might not be the right choice.

Option J: Negative income elasticity. Wait, no. Normal goods have positive income elasticity because demand increases with income. So J is the opposite of what we want.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be C: positive income elasticity. Because normal goods, by definition, have demand that increases with income, leading to positive income elasticity.

Normal goods are products for which demand increases as income rises. This characteristic is directly tied to positive income elasticity of demand. Among the options provided, only Option C correctly identifies this relationship.

Answer: C
