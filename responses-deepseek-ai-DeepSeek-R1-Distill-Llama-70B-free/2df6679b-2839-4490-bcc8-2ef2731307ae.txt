Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm supposed to find the ratio of low-fat milk to chocolate milk that the Tranquility Inn orders weekly. Hmm, ratios can be a bit tricky sometimes, but I think I can handle this.

Let me read the question again. It says they order 40 gallons of low-fat milk and 15 gallons of chocolate milk each week. I need to find the ratio of low-fat to chocolate, so that's 40 to 15. 

Wait, ratios are usually expressed in the simplest whole numbers, right? So I should probably simplify 40:15. How do I do that? Oh yeah, by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of both numbers and then dividing each by that number.

Let me think about the factors of 40 and 15. 40 can be divided by 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40. For 15, the factors are 1, 3, 5, 15. The common factors here are 1 and 5. The greatest one is 5. So I should divide both 40 and 15 by 5.

Calculating that: 40 divided by 5 is 8, and 15 divided by 5 is 3. So the simplified ratio is 8:3.

Now I need to look at the options given. Let's see:

A: 5:03 → Wait, that might be a typo. 5:03 doesn't make sense as a ratio; probably meant 5:3, but that's not what we have.

B: 8:04 → Again, 04 is probably 4, so 8:4. Wait, that's 2:1 when simplified, but our answer is 8:3.

C: 8:05 → So 8:5. Hmm, no, that's not matching 8:3.

D: 2:01 → 2:1, which is simpler, but our ratio is 8:3, so this isn't it.

E: 3:01 → 3:1, nope.

F: 8:03 → That's 8:3. Oh, wait, that's exactly what I got! So F must be the correct answer.

Let me double-check. 40 divided by 5 is 8, 15 divided by 5 is 3. So 8:3 is correct. Looking back at the options, F is 8:03, which is the same as 8:3. So yes, F is the right choice.

The ratio of low-fat milk to chocolate milk ordered weekly by the Tranquility Inn is calculated by simplifying 40:15. Dividing both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 5, gives 8:3. Among the options provided, F corresponds to 8:3.
