Okay, so I'm trying to solve this accounting problem about depreciation using the sum-of-the-years'-digits method. Hmm, I remember that depreciation is the process of allocating the cost of an asset over its useful life. But wait, what's the sum-of-the-years'-digits method exactly?

From what I recall, this method is an accelerated depreciation technique. It means that more depreciation is recorded in the early years and less in the later years. The formula for each year's depreciation involves the remaining book value multiplied by a fraction. The denominator is the sum of the years' digits, and the numerator decreases each year.

So the problem states that Hershberg's Accounting Service bought a computer for $6,300,000. The useful life is 35 years, and it will be worthless at the end. I need to find the depreciation for the first three years.

Wait, first I should calculate the sum of the years' digits. The formula for the sum is n(n + 1)/2, where n is the number of years. So for 35 years, the sum would be 35 * 36 / 2. Let me calculate that: 35 times 36 is 1260, divided by 2 is 630. So the denominator is 630.

Each year's depreciation is calculated by taking the remaining book value (which is initially the cost, $6,300,000) multiplied by a fraction. For the first year, the numerator is 35/630, right? Because the first year's digit is 35. Wait, no, wait. The sum-of-the-years'-digits method uses the years' digits in reverse. Oh wait, no, I think the first year uses the highest digit, which is the total life. So for 35 years, the first year's fraction is 35/630, the second is 34/630, and so on until the last year, which is 1/630.

So for the first year, the depreciation would be 6,300,000 multiplied by (35/630). Let me calculate that. 35 divided by 630 is 0.055555... So 6,300,000 times 0.055555 is 6,300,000 * (1/18). Let me compute that: 6,300,000 / 18. Hmm, 6,300,000 divided by 18. 18 times 350,000 is 6,300,000. So 350,000 as the first year's depreciation.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 350k as the first year in all options. Let's see. The second year's depreciation would be 34/630. 34 divided by 630 is approximately 0.053968. So 6,300,000 times 0.053968. Let's compute that: 6,300,000 * 34 / 630. Oh wait, 6,300,000 divided by 630 is 10,000. So 34 * 10,000 equals 340,000. So the second year is 340,000.

Third year's depreciation is 33/630. So 6,300,000 * (33/630) = (6,300,000 /630) *33. Again, 6,300,000/630 is 10,000. 10,000 * 33 is 330,000.

So the first three years' depreciation would be 350k, 340k, 330k. Looking at the options, let me check.

Option H is 350k, 340k, 330k. So that's the one.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Sometimes people confuse sum of years with other methods. Let me double-check the sum. 35 years, sum is (35)(35+1)/2 = 35*36/2=630, correct.

Each year's rate is (n)/(sum), where n decreases from 35 to 1. So yes, first year 35/630=1/18=0.055555.

Yes, so 6.3M * 0.055555 is 350,000. Then 34/630 is 340k, 33/630 is 330k. So the first three years are 350, 340, 330. So the correct answer is option H.

To calculate the depreciation for the first three years using the sum-of-the-years'-digits method, the following steps are taken:

1. **Determine the sum of the years' digits**: For a useful life of 35 years, the sum is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Sum} = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{35 \times 36}{2} = 630
   \]

2. **Calculate the depreciation for each year**:  
   - **First year**: Depreciation = \(\frac{35}{630} \times 6,300,000 = 350,000\)  
   - **Second year**: Depreciation = \(\frac{34}{630} \times 6,300,000 = 340,000\)  
   - **Third year**: Depreciation = \(\frac{33}{630} \times 6,300,000 = 330,000\)  

Thus, the depreciation for the first three years is $350,000, $340,000, and $330,000.

**Correct Answer**: H: $350,000, $340,000, $330,000
