Okay, so I've got this biology question here about plant hybrids and chromosome numbers. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says that hybrids between some related plant species are sterile because the parent plants had different chromosome numbers. Then, sometimes the hybrid's chromosome number doubles spontaneously. I need to figure out what happens to the descendants of these plants.

Hmm, I remember that when two different species mate, their offspring (the hybrid) can have trouble reproducing because their chromosomes don't pair correctly during meiosis. For example, if one parent has diploid (2n) and the other has tetraploid (4n), their hybrid might end up with 3n, which is triploid. Triploid plants are usually sterile because during meiosis, the chromosomes can't pair properly—there's an odd number, so they can't split evenly into gametes.

But wait, sometimes these hybrids can undergo something called allopolyploidy. If the chromosome number doubles, so the triploid (3n) becomes hexaploid (6n), that might change things. Oh right, because when the number doubles, each set has a pair. So a triploid (which is 3n) doubling becomes 6n, which is actually a tetraploid relative to the original parents? Wait no, triploid is 3n, doubling would make it 6n, which is diploid for each original species.

Wait, no. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Let's say the parents are diploid species. Species A has 2n=2x (so x is the haploid number), and Species B has 2n=4x. So their hybrid would be 2x + 4x = 6x, making it a hexaploid. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, when you cross two diploids, their gametes are haploid. So if species A is diploid (2x) and species B is diploid but with a different number, say 2y, perhaps. Wait, maybe I should think of a specific example.

Wait, another approach: when two species with different chromosome numbers mate, their hybrid ends up with an odd number. For example, if one has diploid (2n=20) and another has diploid (2n=16), their hybrid would have 2n=18 (but wait, no, when you cross two diploids, the hybrid would get n from each, so 10+8=18, making it diploid? No, that's not right. Wait, wait, no. Wait, when two diploid plants (each with 2n chromosomes) cross, the hybrid would have n from each parent, so n+n=2n. So maybe the parent plants have different diploid numbers. Like, Parent 1 is diploid (2n=2x) and Parent 2 is diploid (2n=2y), but x ≠ y. Then the hybrid would have n=x + n=y, so the hybrid is diploid but with an unbalanced set, maybe leading to sterility because during gamete formation, the chromosomes can't pair properly.

Wait, but the question says the parents had different chromosome numbers. Oh, wait, perhaps each parent is diploid but with different numbers. So if Parent A is diploid with 2n=4 (so n=2), and Parent B is diploid with 2n=6 (so n=3), then the hybrid would be n=2 + n=3 = 5, making the hybrid diploid (2n=10? No, wait, no. Wait, diploid is 2n—so the hybrid has n=5, so diploid would be 2n=10, but each gamete would have 5 chromosomes. But if the parents have different haploid numbers, the hybrid ends up with a diploid number that's the sum, but when they try to produce gametes, the cells can't split correctly because the chromosomes don't pair. So the hybrid is sterile.

But if the hybrid's chromosome number doubles, what happens? So the hybrid's original number is 2n (e.g., 2n=10, as above). If it becomes 4n (so 4n=20), then during meiosis, each chromosome has a pair. Wait, but 4n would be tetraploid. Wait, but the original parents were diploid. So if the hybrid becomes tetraploid, then each chromosome has a homolog to pair with. So that would allow normal meiosis, meaning the plant can reproduce, producing viable gametes.

So the descendants of such a plant would be fertile because they can undergo normal meiosis. So looking at the options, I need to find which one matches this.

The question asks which option best describes the descendants. Let's look at the options:

Option J says the descendants would regain the ability to reproduce sexually because chromosomes could pair normally. That makes sense because after doubling, each chromosome has a homolog, so meiosis works.

Option H says they would be reproductively successful because they could backcross with the parent species. Hmm. Wait, if the hybrid is now tetraploid, can it backcross with the diploid parents? Like, if the parents are diploid (2n) and the hybrid is now tetraploid (4n), then when they mate, the offspring would be 3n (triploid), which is sterile. So backcrossing might not be advantageous. But the hybrid itself can now reproduce on its own, creating a new fertile line.

Option I says descendants would be reproductively isolated because of increased chromosome number. Well, the new plant is tetraploid. If they can mate with themselves or other tetraploids, they can reproduce. But if they try to mate with diploid plants, the offspring would be sterile. So they might form a new species that's reproductively isolated from the parents, but that's not the same as their own descendants being isolated. Or is the question about their own fertility?

Wait, the question is about the descendants of those plants with the doubled chromosome number. So the plant with the doubled number can now reproduce normally, so its descendants would be fertile. So the best option would be J, because the plant can now undergo normal meiosis, produce viable gametes, and thus its descendants would be fertile.

Alternatively, option H says the descendants could backcross with the parents and be successful. But if the parents are diploid, and the hybrid is tetraploid, backcrossing would result in triploid offspring, which are sterile. So H might not be correct.

Option I says the descendants are reproductively isolated because of the chromosome number. Well, if the plant is now tetraploid, it can interbreed with other tetraploid plants but not with diploid ones. So the descendants would form a new species, which would be reproductively isolated from the original diploid species. But the question is about the ability of the descendants to reproduce, not their isolation. So maybe I is about their isolation, but the main point is that they can reproduce.

So the correct answer should be J, because the chromosomes can pair normally, allowing sexual reproduction.

When hybrids between related plant species are sterile due to differing chromosome numbers, it is often because their chromosomes cannot pair properly during meiosis. For example, if one parent is diploid (2n) and the other is diploid but with a different chromosome number, their hybrid may end up with an unbalanced chromosome set, leading to sterility. However, if the hybrid's chromosome number doubles spontaneously, it can restore the ability to pair chromosomes correctly during meiosis.

For instance, if the hybrid initially has a chromosome number that is an odd multiple (e.g., 3n), doubling the chromosome number results in an even multiple (e.g., 6n). This allows each chromosome to have a homologous pair, enabling normal meiosis and the production of viable gametes. Consequently, the descendants of such plants would regain the ability to reproduce sexually.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option J** correctly states that the descendants would regain the ability to reproduce sexually because chromosomes could pair normally. This aligns with the explanation above.
- **Option H** suggests reproductive success through backcrossing with parental species, but backcrossing a tetraploid (4n) with a diploid (2n) would produce sterile triploid (3n) offspring, making this option incorrect.
- **Option I** mentions reproductive isolation due to the increased chromosome number, but the question focuses on the descendants' ability to reproduce, not their isolation from other species.
- Other options (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) are incorrect because they do not accurately describe the outcomes of doubling the chromosome number.

Thus, the best answer is **J**, as it accurately describes the descendants' ability to reproduce sexually due to proper chromosome pairing.

Answer: J
