Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about finding the electric field produced by a varying magnetic field. Hmm, I remember that when the magnetic field changes over time, it creates an electric field. Oh right, that's Faraday's Law of Induction!

The problem states that the magnetic field B is increasing exponentially with time. The given expression is B = B_0 e^{bt} a_z. Wait, a_z is the unit vector in the z-direction, so B is pointing upwards along z and its magnitude is B_0 times e to the bt. So the magnetic field is getting stronger exponentially.

I need to find the electric field E produced by this varying B. From what I remember, Faraday's Law is involved here. Faraday's Law states that the curl of the electric field E is equal to the negative rate of change of the magnetic flux density B. The equation is ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t.

But wait, how do I apply this in this scenario? Let's think. Since the magnetic field is varying with time and is pointing in the z-direction, I should probably consider a simple case where the electric field is circular around the z-axis. That is, the electric field would form circles in planes perpendicular to the z-axis. So, symmetry suggests that E would be in the phi direction (like in cylindrical coordinates).

So in cylindrical coordinates (r, phi, z), the magnetic field is B = B_z(r, t) a_z. But wait, in this problem, B is given as B_0 e^{bt} a_z. Oh, but wait, that expression doesn't have any dependence on r. So B is uniform in space, varying only with time. Wait, but that's interesting because if B is uniform in space, then its time derivative is the same everywhere.

Wait a second, Faraday's Law involves the curl of E, which is a spatial derivative of E. But if B is uniform, then ∂B/∂t is uniform as well. So what does that mean for the curl of E?

Wait, let's write Faraday's Law in integral form to get some intuition. The integral form is the electromotive force (EMF) around a loop equals the negative rate of change of magnetic flux through the loop. So EMF = ∮ E · dl = -dΦ_B/dt.

If B is uniform and only varying with time, then the magnetic flux Φ_B through a loop of area A is Φ = B(t) * A. So dΦ/dt = (dB/dt) * A.

Now, the EMF is the integral of E around the loop. If the loop is circular with radius r, then the path is circular, and by symmetry, the electric field E should be the same in magnitude at every point on the loop and tangential. So E * (2π r) equals the EMF.

So E * 2π r = - dΦ/dt = - A * dB/dt.

Wait, but what's A here? The area of the loop is π r². So putting it all together:

E * 2π r = - (π r²) * dB/dt.

Solving for E, we get E = - (r/2) * dB/dt * a_phi.

Because E is directed in the phi direction, which is tangential, and the negative sign indicates the direction is such as to oppose the change in magnetic flux (Lenz's Law).

Now, let's compute dB/dt. Given B(t) = B_0 e^{bt}, so the time derivative is dB/dt = b B_0 e^{bt}.

Substituting back into E:

E = - (r/2) * (b B_0 e^{bt}) * a_phi.

Wait, but looking at the options given, let me check each one:

Option A: E = b B_0 e^{bt} a_phi. Hmm, that's positive, but our result has a negative sign. So A is out.

Option B: E = - (1/2) b B_0 e^{bt} a_phi. Wait, but this doesn't have the r term. In our case, E depends on r because E is proportional to r. But looking at the options, none of them have an r except maybe option A and B, but they don't have r in the expression. Wait, that's confusing.

Wait, looking again, the options don't include r. So perhaps the question assumes a specific value or is expressed differently. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait a minute, I realized that in the problem statement, the magnetic field is given as B = B_0 e^{bt} a_z. So dB/dt is b B_0 e^{bt} a_z. So the expression for E is E = - (r/2) (b B_0 e^{bt}) a_phi. But none of the options have r in them. So maybe the question assumes a different approach or perhaps it's considering a different coordinate system or displacement.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different form, such as looking for the magnitude without the spatial dependence. Or perhaps the setup is different.

Wait, another thought: maybe the magnetic field isn't actually uniform in space. Let me read the problem again. It says B increases exponentially with time, but does it say anything about spatial variation? No, the given B is B_0 e^{bt} a_z, which is uniform in space. So the time derivative is uniform as well.

So how can E not depend on r? Because in this case, the electric field would vary with r. But the options don't have r in them. Hmm. So maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider Maxwell's equations in differential form. The curl of E is - dB/dt. So in cylindrical coordinates, let's write the curl of E. Since E has only a phi component and that depends on r and t, but let's see.

In cylindrical coordinates, the curl in z-component comes from (1/r)(d(r E_phi)/dr) - (d E_r / r dz). But in this case, E_r and E_z are zero. So the z-component of curl E is (1/r) d(r E_phi)/ dr.

Wait, but the curl of E must equal -dB/dt, which is along the z-direction. So,

(1/r) d(r E_phi)/ dr = - dB_z/dt.

But dB_z/dt is b B_0 e^{bt}.

So,

(1/r) d(r E_phi)/ dr = - b B_0 e^{bt}.

Let me rearrange that:

d(r E_phi)/ dr = - b B_0 e^{bt} * r.

Integrating both sides with respect to r:

r E_phi = - (b B_0 e^{bt}) * ∫ r dr = - (b B_0 e^{bt}) * (r²/2) + C,

where C is the constant of integration.

So,

E_phi = - (b B_0 e^{bt} r ) / 2 + C/(r).

Hmm, but what about the constant C? Since the electric field must remain finite at r=0, the term C/(r) would go to infinity unless C=0. So C must be zero.

Thus,

E_phi = - (b B_0 e^{bt} r ) / 2.

But wait, the options don't have an r term. So I'm a bit confused now. Because according to this, E depends on r, but the options don't include any dependence on r.

Wait the options have expressions like e^{bt} a_phi, but without r. So perhaps the question is considering a different scenario, such as a varying B that's not uniform but perhaps depends on position? Or perhaps there's a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem setup. Wait, the problem says "magnetic field which increases exponentially with time". If B is increasing exponentially, and it's uniform, then the electric field lines are circular with E proportional to r. But the options don't have this r dependence.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option C: E = - (1/2) b B_0 e^{bt} a_phi.

Wait, that's a constant (in space) electric field pointing in the phi direction, but that doesn't make sense because E should depend on r. Unless perhaps the problem assumes a specific value of r, but that's not indicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps the magnetic field is in the form that depends on position as well as time. Wait, but the given B is B = B_0 e^{bt} a_z, which is only a function of time, not space. So dB/dt is same everywhere.

Wait another thing: Maybe the problem is in a different unit system, but I don't think that affects the dependence on r.

So perhaps the given options have a mistake, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the setup.

Wait another approach: Maybe the problem is in one dimension, but that doesn't make much sense with a varying B-field. Alternatively, perhaps the field is confined to a particular region, but the problem doesn't specify that.

Wait, perhaps the question is assuming a particular gauge or something. But I don't think that's relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question made a typo and the correct answer is supposed to involve r, but the options don't include it. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option C is E = - (1/2) b B_0 e^{bt} a_phi. So the magnitude is (1/2) b B_0 e^{bt}, and it's in the phi direction. But according to our earlier calculation, E should be proportional to r. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. Or possibly I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe the question is considering a different Maxwell's equation. Let me double-check Faraday's Law. Oh wait, perhaps I should consider displacement current as well, but no, displacement current is part of Ampère's Law, and here we're dealing with Faraday's Law, which doesn't include displacement current. So that shouldn't affect it.

Wait, another thought: if B is uniform in space, then the curl of E would be uniform as well, because ∂B/∂t is uniform. But wait, the curl of E in cylindrical coordinates would actually depend on r, as we saw earlier. So that suggests that E must depend on r, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers a specific case where r is a certain value. But the problem statement doesn't specify any particular location, so that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in SI units and I'm missing a factor of 2. Let me re-express the integral approach.

In the integral form, EMF = -dΦ/dt.

EMF is ∮ E · dl = E * 2π r.

dΦ/dt is d(B(t) * π r²)/dt = π r² dB/dt.

So,

E * 2π r = - π r² (b B_0 e^{bt}).

Divide both sides by 2π r:

E = - (r/2) b B_0 e^{bt}.

So E is proportional to r, which is the same as what I found earlier. But the options don't have r in them, so this is confusing.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C is E = - (1/2) b B_0 e^{bt} a_phi. So that would be the case if r=1, but that doesn't make sense because r is a variable. So perhaps the question is incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Alternatively, maybe the problem isn't in free space but in a different medium, but the question doesn't mention that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the given B(t) is incorrect. Oh wait, the problem says B increases exponentially, so B = B_0 e^{bt} a_z. So that's correct.

Wait another thing: Maybe the problem is in a region where the magnetic field is varying but only along a particular axis, but I'm not sure how that would affect the result.

Alternatively, perhaps the electric field is being considered at a specific radius, say r=1, but that would be unusual unless stated.

Wait, perhaps the given options have a typo. For example, option C could be missing an 'r' term. But since that's not the case, perhaps I need to reevaluate my approach.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is using a different form of the magnetic field. Let me re-express B.

Wait, B is given as B_0 e^{bt} a_z. So dB/dt is b B_0 e^{bt} a_z.

So using Faraday's law in integral form, for a circular loop of radius r, the EMF is E * 2π r = - dΦ/dt = - π r² * (b B_0 e^{bt}).

So E = [ - π r² b B_0 e^{bt} ] / [2 π r ] = - (r b B_0 e^{bt}) / 2.

So E = - (b B_0 e^{bt} r ) / 2 * a_phi.

But since the options don't include 'r', perhaps the problem is considering a different approach. Wait, maybe the problem is in a different coordinate system, but I can't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the magnitude of E, but that still doesn't resolve the 'r' issue.

Wait, maybe the problem is looking for the electric field at a particular radius, say r=0. But at r=0, E would be zero. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a line integral around a path where r is a function of something else, but that's not indicated.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck because according to my calculations, the correct answer should involve 'r', but none of the options do. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, let me consider the differential form again. The curl of E is - dB/dt.

In cylindrical coordinates, the z-component of curl E is (1/r)(d (r E_phi)/ dr) = - dB_z/dt.

So,

d (r E_phi) / dr = - r (dB_z/dt).

Integrate both sides from 0 to r:

r E_phi = - ∫0^r r' (dB_z/dt) dr'.

But dB_z/dt is b B_0 e^{bt}, which is uniform in space, so:

r E_phi = - (b B_0 e^{bt}) ∫0^r r' dr' = - (b B_0 e^{bt}) [ r'^2 / 2 ] from 0 to r.

So,

r E_phi = - (b B_0 e^{bt}) (r² / 2 - 0) = - (b B_0 e^{bt} r² ) / 2.

Divide both sides by r:

E_phi = - (b B_0 e^{bt} r ) / 2.

Which is the same result as before. So again, E depends on r, but the options don't include r. So I'm missing something.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option C: E = - (1/2) b B_0 e^{bt} a_phi.

So this doesn't have the 'r' term. Hmm. That would imply that E is same everywhere, which doesn't make sense because E should form circular loops and vary with r.

But perhaps the question is considering the magnitude at a specific radius. For example, if the radius is taken as r=1, then E would be - (1/2) b B_0 e^{bt} a_phi, which matches option C.

But the problem doesn't specify any particular radius. So that's confusing. Or perhaps the question is considering an infinitesimal loop where r approaches zero, but then E would approach zero, which doesn't fit any of the options.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering a different approach where the electric field is uniform, but that can't be right because a uniform E would have a curl of zero, which would require dB/dt to be zero, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different definition or approximation. Maybe it's using the magnitude without considering the spatial variation. But that would be incorrect because E does vary with r.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a scalar form of Faraday's Law, but I'm not sure how that would apply here.

Wait, perhaps the question is incorrect, and the correct answer isn't among the options. But that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the electric field at a specific radius, say r equals something. For example, if the loop is of radius 'a', then E would be proportional to 'a'. But without any information on radius, this assumption can't be made.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me see the options again:

Option C is E = - (1/2) b B_0 e^{bt} a_phi.

So according to my calculation, E is proportional to r, but in option C, it's a constant. So that's a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not varying with space, but that's only possible if B is not uniform. But according to the given expression, B is uniform in space. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps someone made a mistake in the problem setup. Alternatively, perhaps the displacement current is being considered, but that affects Ampère's Law, not Faraday's Law. So that shouldn't change anything here.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about Maxwell's equations. Faraday's Law in integral form is:

∮ E · dl = - d/dt ∫ B · dA.

If B is uniform (same everywhere), then ∫ B · dA = B(t) * A, where A is the area.

So for a circular loop of radius r, EMF = E * 2π r = - d/dt (B(t) π r²) = - π r² (dB/dt).

So E = (- r² / (2 r)) dB/dt = (- r/2) dB/dt.

Which again gives E proportional to r.

So without any 'r' in the options, perhaps the correct answer is not present. But that can't be right because the options are provided.

Wait, perhaps the problem was intended to have a static B-field, but that's not the case because B is varying.

Alternatively, perhaps the magnetic field is B = B_0 e^{bt r} a_z, which would make B depend on space. But the problem states B = B_0 e^{bt} a_z, so that's not the case.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is using a different definition of the exponential. Perhaps it's B
