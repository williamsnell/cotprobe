Okay, so I have this physics problem about electromagnetic induction. Hmm, I remember that when the magnetic field through a coil changes, it induces an electromotive force, or EMF, in the coil. The question is asking for the average induced EMF.

Let me read the problem again. The magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane of a circular coil. The coil has an area of 0.2 m² and 250 turns. The magnetic field increases from 0.01 T to 0.06 T over a time interval of 0.25 seconds. I need to find the average induced EMF.

I think Faraday's Law of Induction is what I need here. Faraday's Law states that the induced EMF is equal to the negative rate of change of magnetic flux through the coil. The formula is EMF = -N * (ΔΦ/Δt), where N is the number of turns, and ΔΦ is the change in magnetic flux over time Δt.

Wait, magnetic flux Φ is given by Φ = B * A * cosθ. Since the field is perpendicular, θ is 0 degrees, so cosθ is 1. So Φ = B * A.

So the change in flux, ΔΦ, would be the final flux minus the initial flux. The initial flux Φ_initial is B_initial * A, and the final Φ_final is B_final * A. So ΔΦ = A * (B_final - B_initial).

Let me plug in the numbers. A is 0.2 m². B_initial is 0.01 T, B_final is 0.06 T. So ΔΦ = 0.2 * (0.06 - 0.01) = 0.2 * 0.05 = 0.01 Wb (since 1 T·m² is 1 Weber).

The change in time Δt is 0.25 seconds. So the rate of change of flux is ΔΦ / Δt = 0.01 / 0.25 = 0.04 Wb/s.

But wait, the number of turns N is 250. So the average EMF is N multiplied by (ΔΦ/Δt). So 250 * 0.04 = 10 V? Wait, that would be 10 volts.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Oh wait, N is 250. Yes, 250 * 0.04 is 10. So EMF is 10 volts? Looking at the options, option G is 10 V. So the answer should be G.

But wait, wait, wait. The formula uses the absolute value because EMF is a magnitude. Oh right, the negative sign just indicates the direction, so for magnitude, it's just N * (ΔΦ/Δt). So yes, 10 V is correct.

Hmm, but I'm a bit confused because 250 times 0.04 is 10. That seems a bit high, but maybe that's correct. Let me see if I did the calculations right.

Change in B is 0.06 - 0.01 = 0.05 T. Area is 0.2, so 0.2 * 0.05 is 0.01 Wb. Time is 0.25 s. 0.01 / 0.25 is 0.04. Multiply by 250, that's 10. Yep, that's right.

To determine the average induced EMF in the coil, we use Faraday's Law of Induction, which states:

\[
\text{EMF} = -N \cdot \frac{\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t}
\]

Here:
- \( N \) is the number of turns in the coil (\( N = 250 \)),
- \( \Delta \Phi \) is the change in magnetic flux,
- \( \Delta t \) is the time interval (\( \Delta t = 0.25 \, \text{s} \)).

### Step 1: Calculate the change in magnetic flux (\( \Delta \Phi \))
Magnetic flux is given by:

\[
\Phi = B \cdot A \cdot \cos\theta
\]

Since the magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane of the coil, \( \theta = 0^\circ \), and \( \cos\theta = 1 \). Thus, \( \Phi = B \cdot A \).

The change in flux is:

\[
\Delta \Phi = \Phi_{\text{final}} - \Phi_{\text{initial}} = A \cdot (B_{\text{final}} - B_{\text{initial}})
\]

Substituting the values:
- \( A = 0.2 \, \text{m}^2 \),
- \( B_{\text{final}} = 0.06 \, \text{T} \),
- \( B_{\text{initial}} = 0.01 \, \text{T} \),

\[
\Delta \Phi = 0.2 \cdot (0.06 - 0.01) = 0.2 \cdot 0.05 = 0.01 \, \text{Wb}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the rate of change of flux (\( \Delta \Phi / \Delta t \))
\[
\frac{\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t} = \frac{0.01}{0.25} = 0.04 \, \text{Wb/s}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the average induced EMF
\[
\text{EMF} = N \cdot \frac{\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t} = 250 \cdot 0.04 = 10 \, \text{V}
\]

Thus, the average induced EMF in the coil is **10 V**.
