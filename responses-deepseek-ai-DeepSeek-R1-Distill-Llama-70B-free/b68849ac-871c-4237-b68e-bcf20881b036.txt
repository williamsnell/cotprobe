Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's read the question again carefully.

The question is asking about a woman who conducted a longitudinal study on herself and found that her retrieval difficulty increased as she got older. The options are from A to J, each a different name.

Hmm, I remember that longitudinal studies involve observing the same subjects over a period of time. The key here is that the study was conducted by a woman on herself, so it's self-experimentation. Also, the focus is on retrieval difficulty, which relates to memory.

Wait, the name that comes to mind is someone who did self-experiments in memory. I think it was Hermann Ebbinghaus, but wait, he was a man, right? Oh, but the question specifies a woman. So maybe it's not Ebbinghaus. Let me think again.

Wait, another thought—there's a researcher named Elizabeth Loftus, but I'm not sure if she did a longitudinal study on herself. Or maybe someone else. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, I recall that there's a researcher who studied memory using herself as a subject. Oh wait, maybe it's Mary Whiton Calkins? She was an American psychologist known for her work on self psychology and memory. She did some self-analysis, but I'm not certain if it was a longitudinal study on retrieval difficulty.

Wait, another angle. The question mentions increased retrieval difficulty with age. That sounds like it relates to the forgetting curve, which Ebbinghaus studied. But he used himself as a subject, and Ebbinghaus was male. So that's conflicting with the question stating it's a woman.

Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up some facts. Let me think about other female psychologists. There's also the case of Claparède's study, but he was male and involved a pinprick and a handshake. Not relevant here.

Wait, another name I remember is Elizabeth Blackburn, but she's a biologist, not a psychologist, so probably not her.

Oh wait, maybe it's someone else. There's a psychologist named White, or perhaps Whitebear? Let me look at the options. Option D is Whitebear. I don't recall a Whitebear in psychology. Wait, another thought: the name might be Ebbinghaus, but the question says it's a woman, so perhaps it's a different person.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to break it down. The key points are:

1. Longitudinal study on herself.
2. Increased retrieval difficulty with age.
3. A woman.

I remember that Ebbinghaus did memory experiments on himself, creating nonsense syllables and testing retention over time. But since he's male, and the question is about a woman, maybe the answer is someone else. Or perhaps the question is mistaken, but I don't think so.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's Mary Ainsworth, but she's known for attachment theory, not memory retrieval.

Or maybe it's someone like Leta Stetter Hollingworth, who did work on women's intelligence but not specifically memory.

Wait, another angle: the question might be referring to the concept of the "Zeigarnik effect," but that's Bluma Zeigarnik, who studied unfinished tasks. Not directly related to retrieval difficulty over time.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the testing effect or retrieval practice. But I'm not sure who the key figure there is, especially a woman who did a longitudinal self-study.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E, Johnson? But I can't think of a Johnson that fits. Or maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, I'm going to think about the options again. The options are A to J. The names include Watson, Smith, Pavlov, Whitebear, Johnson, Clark, Freud, Skinner, Ebbinghaus, Blackbird.

Wait, Ebbinghaus is option I. But he's a man. So the question is about a woman. So perhaps the correct answer isn't Ebbinghaus. But then who is it?

Wait, I'm drawing a blank. Maybe the answer is D: Whitebear? Or perhaps I'm confusing it with someone else.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is B: Smith, but I don't know a Smith associated with such a study.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the woman is Bellezza, but that's a male name, I think. Or maybe it's someone else.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the "overjustification effect" or something else entirely. No, that's Lepper, I believe.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the " Levels of Processing" theory by Craik and Lockhart, but that's not a woman.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the question again. The woman conducted a longitudinal study on herself. Found increased retrieval difficulty as she aged. So it's someone who studied their own memory over time.

Wait, another angle: the only woman I can think of who did extensive self-experimentation in memory is perhaps someone like Wilder Penfield, but he's male and a neurosurgeon. Not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E: Johnson. I'm not sure, but I don't recall any notable Johnson in that context.

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing this up with the concept of "reminiscence bump," but that's associated with memory and age, but the researchers there are different.

Wait, perhaps the answer is I: Ebbinghaus. But he's a man, so that can't be.

Wait, maybe the question is incorrect, but I doubt that. Alternatively, perhaps the name is White, but option D is Whitebear, which I don't recognize.

Wait, perhaps it's a trick question, and the answer is Ebbinghaus, despite being male, but the question says 'woman,' so that can't be.

Wait, let me think of some female researchers. There's Carol Gilligan, known for moral development, not memory. Or maybe someone like Sandra Bem, but her work was on gender roles.

Wait, maybe it's someone like Frances Yates, who wrote "The Art of Memory," but that's historical, not a longitudinal study on herself.

Alternatively, maybe it's someone like Anne Treisman, known for feature integration theory in perception, not memory retrieval.

Wait, I'm stuck. Given the options, perhaps I should go back to the options and consider which name is associated with memory. Ebbinghaus is the main one. But since the question says 'woman,' and option I is Ebbinghaus, which is male, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the answer is D: Whitebear. But I don't recognize that name in psychology. Maybe it's a fictional name or a less-known researcher.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is H: Skinner, but he's male, known for operant conditioning.

Wait, another thought: the question might be referring to the "spacing effect" or the "testing effect." But those are more associated with Bjork or Roediger, both males.

Wait, I'm really not getting this. Let me try to think of any female psychologists known for memory studies. There's Endel Tulving, but he's male. Oh, wait, maybe it's someone like Fergus Craik's wife, but I don't recall her name.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E: Johnson. I'm not sure, but perhaps it's someone like that.

Alternatively, maybe it's B: Smith, but I don't know.

Wait, another angle: the woman in question might have done a study similar to Ebbinghaus, but perhaps her name isn't as well-known. Maybe the answer is D: Whitebear.

Wait, I'm going to make a guess here. I think the correct answer is I: Ebbinghaus, but since the question says it's a woman, perhaps I'm wrong. Alternatively, maybe the answer is D: Whitebear.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is J: Blackbird, but that doesn't ring a bell.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the names again. The options are A: Watson, B: Smith, C: Pavlov, D: Whitebear, E: Johnson, F: Clark, G: Freud, H: Skinner, I: Ebbinghaus, J: Blackbird.

Wait, I think I've heard of Mary Whiton Calkins, but her name isn't in the options. So perhaps the answer is D: Whitebear, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the answer is none of the above, but that's not an option. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a fictional example, but I doubt it.

Wait, another thought: maybe the woman's name is Elizabeth White, but that's not in the options. Alternatively, perhaps it's someone like White, but the option is D: Whitebear.

Wait, I'm going to go with the only name that's associated with memory, even though it's male. But the question says it's a woman, so that can't be. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E: Johnson. But I can't think of any reason why.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D: Whitebear, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm really stuck here. I think I'm going to have to make an educated guess. Since Ebbinghaus did self-experiments on memory, but he's male, perhaps the intended answer is I: Ebbinghaus, but the question has a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is someone else.

Wait, no, the question specifies a woman, so it can't be Ebbinghaus. So perhaps the answer is D: Whitebear, even though I'm not familiar with that name.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B: Smith, but I don't know.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options again. The only name I'm sure about in memory is Ebbinghaus, but he's male. So maybe the intended answer is I: Ebbinghaus, assuming the question might have a typo, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E: Johnson. But I can't think of any reason why.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D: Whitebear, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I'm going to have to go with the process of elimination. Since Ebbinghaus is the only one associated with memory, but the question says it's a woman, perhaps the intended answer is someone else, but I'm not identifying them.

Wait, another thought: maybe the woman's name is Mary White, but that's not in the options. Alternatively, perhaps it's someone like White, but the option is D: Whitebear.

Wait, I'm really not getting this. I think I'm stuck, so I'm going to have to make a guess. I'll go with option D: Whitebear, even though I'm not sure.

The question asks about a woman who conducted a longitudinal study on herself, focusing on increased retrieval difficulty as she aged. Key points include self-experimentation, memory retrieval, and the subject being female. 

Ebbinghaus is well-known for memory studies, particularly the forgetting curve, but he is male, so he doesn't fit the criteria. Other notable psychologists like Pavlov, Freud, and Skinner are also male, eliminating options C, G, and H. Watson (A) and Clark (F) are not associated with such a study. Johnson (E) and Smith (B) lack clear connections to this specific research. Blackbird (J) is not a recognized name in psychology.

The only plausible option left is Whitebear (D), though the name isn't widely recognized in the context of memory research. Despite uncertainty, Whitebear seems to be the intended answer based on the elimination process.

Answer: D
