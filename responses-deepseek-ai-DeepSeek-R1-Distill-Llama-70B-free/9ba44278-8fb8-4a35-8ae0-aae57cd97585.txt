B: 0.008 lb
C: 8 kg
D: 800 lb
E: .8 lb
F: 8000 lb
G: 80 lb

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about water pressure and a leak in a pipe. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. Alright, the question says a water pipe has a pressure of 80 lb per square inch. There's a leak with an area of 0.01 square inches. They want to know how much force a patch needs to apply to stop the leak. 

Wait, right, pressure is force per unit area. Oh yeah, the formula is Pressure (P) equals Force (F) divided by Area (A). So P = F/A. Which means Force would be P multiplied by A, so F = P * A.

So the numbers here: the pressure is 80 lb/in², and the area is 0.01 in². Let me plug these into the formula. Force is 80 * 0.01. Let me calculate that. 80 times 0.01 is 0.8. So the force needed is 0.8 lb. 

Looking at the answer options, option E is 0.8 lb. So that should be the correct answer. 

Wait a second, did I miss anything? The units seem to line up. Pressure in pounds per square inch, area in square inches, so force comes out in pounds. Yep, that makes sense. So E is the one.

The problem involves calculating the force required to stop a leak in a water pipe using the formula for pressure, \( P = \frac{F}{A} \), which can be rearranged to \( F = P \cdot A \). Given the pressure \( P = 80 \, \text{lb/in}^2 \) and the area of the leak \( A = 0.01 \, \text{in}^2 \), the force is calculated as:

\[
F = 80 \cdot 0.01 = 0.8 \, \text{lb}.
\]

Among the answer choices, the correct one is:

E: 0.8 lb.
