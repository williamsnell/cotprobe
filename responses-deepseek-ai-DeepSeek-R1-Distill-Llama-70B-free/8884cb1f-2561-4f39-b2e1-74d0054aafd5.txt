Okay, so I've got this tax question here about calculating the basis of some stock shares when sold. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, so Lemon owns 2000 shares of Spectrol Corp. He bought them in year 1 at $10.50 each. So initially, the total cost would be 2000 * 10.50. Let me calculate that: 2000 * 10 is 20,000, and 2000 * 0.50 is 1,000, so total is $21,000. So his initial basis is $21,000 for 2000 shares.

In year 4, he received a 5% non-taxable dividend of Spectrol common stock. Hmm, non-taxable dividends are usually stock dividends, right? So when a company issues a stock dividend, the shareholder doesn't have to pay taxes at the time. But this affects the basis of the stock.

I remember that for stock dividends, the basis is adjusted. Since it's a non-taxable dividend, the total basis remains the same but spreads out over more shares. So a 5% dividend means he gets 5% more shares. So 5% of 2000 shares is 100 shares. So now he has 2100 shares.

Wait, but how does this affect the basis? The basis per share would decrease because the same total basis is spread over more shares. So the original basis was $21,000 for 2000 shares. After getting 100 more shares, the basis per share becomes 21,000 / 2100. Let me calculate that: 21,000 divided by 2100 is $10 per share. So each share now has a basis of $10.

Wait, wait, no. Another thought: When you receive a stock dividend, the basis for the new shares is based on the proportion of the total value. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of basis allocation. For a stock dividend, the basis is reallocated based on the relative fair market values. But if it's a non-taxable stock dividend, like a 5% dividend, the basis of the original stock is spread over the new shares.

Alternatively, perhaps the basis is adjusted by adding the value of the dividend, but since it's non-taxable, the basis doesn't change. Wait, no. For a non-taxable stock dividend, the basis doesn't change because you're not taxed on it. So the basis per share gets diluted.

Let me think again. Suppose I have 100 shares with a basis of $100. If I get a 10% stock dividend (so 10 more shares), the basis per share would be $100/110 shares, which is about $0.909 per share. But wait, no, the total basis remains the same, but now spread over more shares. So in this case, the initial basis is $21,000 for 2000 shares. After getting 5% more, 2100 shares, the basis per share is 21,000 / 2100 = $10 per share. So each share is now worth $10 in basis.

Then, in year 5, the stock splits 2-for-1. A stock split affects the basis per share. In a 2-for-1 split, each share becomes two shares. So the number of shares Lemon has would double. So from 2100 shares, after the split, he has 4200 shares.

How does the basis adjust here? Well, the total basis remains the same, but each share's basis is halved because each original share becomes two. So prior to split, each share had a basis of $10. After split, each of the two shares would have a basis of $5.

So now, Lemon has 4200 shares, each with a basis of $5. So total basis is still 4200 *5= $21,000.

Now, in the current year, Lemon sells 800 shares. We need to find the basis of these 800 shares. Since the basis per share is $5, 800 shares would have a basis of 800 *5= $4,000.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me retrace.

Initial purchase: 2000 shares, $10.50 each: 2000 *10.50 = $21,000.

Year 4: 5% stock dividend. So 2000 *0.05=100 shares. Basis for these new shares comes from the original basis. Since it's a non-taxable dividend, the basis is reallocated. So the original 2000 shares had $21,000 basis, and now 2100 shares exist. So each share's basis is 21,000 /2100 = $10.

Year 5: 2-for-1 split. So each share becomes two. So 2100 shares become 4200. Basis per share is $10 /2 = $5.

So when he sells 800 shares, each has a basis of $5. So 800 *5= $4,000. So the basis for the 800 shares sold would be $4,000.

Looking at the options, option C is $4,000. So the answer should be C.

Lemon initially purchased 2000 shares of Spectrol Corp. common stock at $10.50 per share, resulting in a total basis of $21,000 ($10.50 × 2000). 

In Year 4, Lemon received a 5% non-taxable stock dividend, which increased the number of shares to 2100 (2000 × 1.05). Since the dividend was non-taxable, the total basis remained $21,000, but the basis per share was reduced to $10 ($21,000 ÷ 2100).

In Year 5, the stock underwent a 2-for-1 split, doubling the number of shares to 4200 (2100 × 2). The basis per share was halved to $5 ($10 ÷ 2), while the total basis remained $21,000 ($5 × 4200).

When Lemon sold 800 shares, the basis in those shares was calculated as $5 per share × 800 shares = $4,000.

Thus, the basis in the 800 shares sold is **$4,000**.
