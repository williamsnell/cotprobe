Okay, so I have this question about peak flow results and the range the three readings should be within. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

I remember that peak flow meters measure how fast a person can breathe out air, right? It's used a lot for asthma management. When someone takes their peak flow, they usually do it a few times because sometimes the first reading might not be accurate, especially if you're not doing it right. So they take three readings and then take the best of those.

But the question is about how close these three readings should be. I think they need to be within a certain range of each other to ensure consistency. If they vary too much, maybe the person isn't doing the maneuver correctly each time, or maybe there's some inconsistency in the measurements.

Wait, I think the guideline says that the three readings should be within a specific number of liters per minute of each other. I'm trying to recall the exact number. I think it's 20 or maybe 30. Let me see... I remember that 20 liters per minute is a common figure for acceptable variation. Because if they're too far apart, it might indicate a problem with the technique or the measurement itself.

Looking at the options: option G is 20, option C is 30. I'm pretty sure it's 20. So the three readings should be within 20 liters per minute of each other. That makes sense because if they're too spread out, the average or best reading might not be reliable.

I don't think it's 10 or 30. I'm more confident it's 20. Let me check: I think in some guidelines, like those from asthma organizations, they recommend ensuring the readings are within 20 L/min. So the correct answer should be G: 20 litres per minute of each other.

The correct answer is G: 20 litres per minute of each other.

The three peak flow readings should be within 20 liters per minute of each other to ensure consistency and accuracy. This guideline helps confirm that the measurements are reliable and correctly performed. 

Answer: G
