Question:

A riot broke out in a city, and many shops had been looted and some had been burned during the riots. Goods of all kinds were in piles or strewn about the sidewalk. During the riot, a defendant was walking along the street when he paused in front of an appliance store. He picked up a portable television set that was lying on the sidewalk and started to walk off quickly. A police officer who was standing in front of the shop rushed after the defendant and arrested him. The defendant, an indigent, was charged with grand larceny, a felony carrying the maximum penalty of seven months imprisonment and a S 1,000 fine. At his arraignment, the judge advised the defendant of his right to have counsel appointed for him. The defendant, however, told the judge that he wanted to represent himself and waive his right to a jury trial. The judge then questioned the defendant at length about his demands. The defendant indicated that he had no previous legal experience. He told the judge that the reason he didn't want a court-appointed attorney to represent him was because he didn't trust lawyers. The judge did not find the defendant's reasons for representing himself to be persuasive and appointed an attorney to represent him. Thereafter, an attorney was appointed by the court to represent the defendant. The attorney told the court that the defendant wanted a non-jury trial. However, at the prosecution's request, the court impaneled a jury. The defendant was subsequently convicted by the jury and sentenced to six months imprisonment. In addition, the defendant was ordered to reimburse the state $450 to cover the cost of his attorney. This reimbursement order was made pursuant to a relevant statute in effect at the time of the defendant's arrest. The defendant appeals both the conviction and the reimbursement order. The appellate court should

Options:

A: affirm both the conviction and the reimbursement order.
B: affirm the conviction because the defendant was provided with an attorney, but reverse the reimbursement order.
C: reverse both the conviction and the reimbursement order because the defendant was not properly informed of his rights.
D: reverse the conviction because the defendant was not informed of the consequences of waiving his right to a jury trial, but affirm the reimbursement order.
E: reverse the conviction because the defendant was not allowed to represent himself, but affirm the reimbursement order.
F: affirm the conviction, but not the reimbursement order.
G: reverse both the conviction and the reimbursement order because the defendant was denied the right to represent himself.
H: reverse the reimbursement order because it exceeds the maximum fine for grand larceny, but affirm the conviction.
I: affirm the reimbursement order, but not the conviction.
J: reverse the conviction because he was denied the right to a non-jury trial, but not the reimbursement order.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this legal question here. Let me read through it carefully and break it down step by step. 

The scenario is about a defendant who was involved in a riot where shops were looted and burned. The defendant picked up a portable TV from the sidewalk and tried to walk off quickly. A police officer arrested him, and he was charged with grand larceny, which is a felony. The possible penalties are up to seven months in jail and a $1,000 fine. 

At his arraignment, the judge told him about his right to have a court-appointed attorney. But the defendant said he wanted to represent himself and waive his right to a jury trial. The judge questioned him about this decision, and the defendant admitted he had no legal experience and didn't trust lawyers. The judge didn't find his reasons persuasive and appointed an attorney anyway. 

Later, the appointed attorney told the court the defendant wanted a non-jury trial, but the prosecution requested a jury, so the court impaneled one. The defendant was convicted by the jury and sentenced to six months in prison. Plus, he was ordered to reimburse the state $450 for the cost of his attorney. This reimbursement was based on a statute in effect at the time of his arrest. 

Now, the defendant is appealing both the conviction and the reimbursement order. The question is what the appellate court should do.

So, the issues here seem to be about two main things: the right to self-representation and the reimbursement order for the attorney's costs.

First, I remember that the right to self-representation is covered under the Sixth Amendment. The landmark case here is Faretta v. California, where the Supreme Court ruled that a defendant has the right to represent themselves, even if it's against their best interest. But there's a catch: the waiver of this right must be knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. So, the judge needs to make sure the defendant fully understands what they're giving up.

In this case, the defendant wanted to represent himself and waive a jury trial. The judge questioned him but didn't find his reasons persuasive and denied the request. But according to Faretta, the judge shouldn't deny the request just because the defendant's reasons aren't persuasive; the key is whether the waiver is knowing and voluntary. So, if the defendant understood the risks, the judge shouldn't force an attorney on him. Denying the right to self-representation would be a violation, which would mean the conviction should be reversed.

Second issue: the reimbursement order. The defendant was ordered to pay $450 for the court-appointed attorney. There's a statute allowing this. But wait, if the defendant was forced to take an attorney against his will, can the state make him pay for it? 

I think about whether such reimbursement statutes are constitutional. In Fuller v. Oregon, the Supreme Court held that states can require reimbursement for appointed counsel as long as it's not done in a way that violates the constitutional mandate of providing counsel for the indigent. But if the defendant was wrongly denied his right to self-representation, then requiring him to pay for the attorney he didn't want might be problematic. 

But wait, in this case, the defendant was indigent, so the court was required to appoint an attorney if he couldn't afford one. But he chose to represent himself, which is his right. However, the judge overrode that choice. So, the appointment of the attorney was done without a valid basis, because the defendant's waiver was proper. Therefore, making him pay for the attorney might be an issue because he was forced to accept representation he didn't want. But I'm not entirely sure about this part. 

Looking at the options, let's go through them:

Option A: Affirm both. But if the defendant's right to self-representation was violated, the conviction should be reversed, so A is probably wrong.

Option B: Affirm conviction, reverse reimbursement. Wait, if the conviction is reversed due to the self-representation issue, then B can't be right since it affirms the conviction.

Option C: Reverse both because not informed of rights. But the judge did advise him, so maybe not. The issue is more about the judge not respecting his waiver.

Option D: Reverse conviction because not informed of jury waiver consequences, affirm reimbursement. The problem was about self-representation, not jury waiver, so D might not be right.

Option E: Reverse conviction because denied self-representation, affirm reimbursement. So this aligns with the first issue. If the right to self-rep was violated, conviction reversed. But what about reimbursement? If the court wrongly appointed an attorney, can they charge him? Maybe not, but E says affirm reimbursement, which might be incorrect because the appointment was improper.

Option F: Affirm conviction, not reimbursement. Again, if the conviction is to be reversed, F is wrong.

Option G: Reverse both because denied self-rep. So this would mean both conviction and reimbursement are reversed. But I'm not sure about the reimbursement part. If the appointment was wrong, perhaps the state shouldn't be able to charge for it.

Option H: Reverse reimbursement because it exceeds the maximum fine. The maximum fine was $1,000, and he was ordered to pay $450. So it doesn't exceed, so H is wrong.

Option I: Affirm reimbursement, not conviction. But if the conviction is reversed, I is incorrect.

Option J: Reverse conviction because denied non-jury trial, and affirm reimbursement. But the issue wasn't about the non-jury trial but self-representation. So J is incorrect.

Wait, so the main issue is that the defendant was denied his right to self-representation. So the conviction should be reversed because of that. As for the reimbursement, since the court shouldn't have forced the attorney on him, making him pay for it would be wrong. Therefore, both the conviction and the reimbursement order should be reversed.

Looking back, option G says reverse both because the defendant was denied the right to represent himself. That would cover both issues.

But wait, in the scenario, the defendant did end up being represented by an attorney, even though he didn't want to. So, he was forced to have an attorney. Therefore, the reimbursement order is for the cost of that attorney. If the appointment was improper, then requiring reimbursement might be improper as well. So, both should be reversed.

So the correct answer would be G: reverse both the conviction and the reimbursement order because the defendant was denied the right to represent himself.

The case involves a defendant charged with grand larceny after picking up a television during a riot. At arraignment, the defendant requested to represent himself and waive his right to a jury trial. The judge, despite questioning the defendant, denied this request and appointed an attorney. The defendant was later convicted by a jury and ordered to reimburse the state $450 for the cost of his court-appointed attorney. The defendant appeals both the conviction and the reimbursement order.

Key legal issues include the defendant's right to self-representation under the Sixth Amendment, as established by *Faretta v. California*, which requires that a waiver of counsel be knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. Here, the judge denied the defendant's request to represent himself, which likely violated his constitutional right. Additionally, the reimbursement order raises concerns about whether the defendant can be forced to pay for an attorney he did not want, especially if the appointment was improper.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as the conviction should be reversed due to the violation of the defendant's right to self-representation.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as it affirms the conviction, which should be reversed.
- **Option C**: Incorrect, as the defendant was advised of his rights, and the issue is not about being uninformed but about the denial of his right to self-representation.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as the primary issue is the denial of self-representation, not the jury trial waiver.
- **Option E**: Incorrect, as it affirms the reimbursement order, which may also be improper if the appointment of counsel was wrongful.
- **Option F**: Incorrect, as it affirms the conviction, which should be reversed.
- **Option G**: Correct, as both the conviction and reimbursement order should be reversed due to the denial of the defendant's right to self-representation.
- **Option H**: Incorrect, as the reimbursement amount does not exceed the maximum fine.
- **Option I**: Incorrect, as it affirms the reimbursement order but not the conviction, which should both be reversed.
- **Option J**: Incorrect, as the issue is not about the non-jury trial but the denial of self-representation.

The appellate court should reverse both the conviction and the reimbursement order because the defendant was denied his constitutional right to represent himself.
