Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about beat frequency. Hmm, I remember that beat frequency has something to do with the difference between two sound frequencies. Let me think. So, when two sounds interfere, they create beats, right? The beat frequency is how often those beats happen per second.

The problem says one source is 500 Hz and the other is 504 Hz. I think the beat frequency is the absolute difference between the two frequencies. So I subtract the smaller from the larger. Let's do that: 504 minus 500 equals 4 Hz. So the beat frequency should be 4 Hz.

Wait, but wait. Sometimes I get confused if it's the sum or the difference. No, no, I'm pretty sure it's the difference. Because beats are caused by the interfering waves when they're close in frequency. The number of times the peaks and troughs interfere constructively and destructively depends on how much their frequencies differ. So the formula is beat frequency equals the absolute value of f1 minus f2.

So in this case, 504-500 is 4. So the beat frequency is 4 Hz. Looking back at the options, option F is 4 Hz. So the answer should be F.

I don't think I made a mistake here. Yeah, I'm confident.

The beat frequency is calculated as the absolute difference between the frequencies of the two sources. Given the frequencies 500 Hz and 504 Hz, the beat frequency is:

\[
|504 \, \text{Hz} - 500 \, \text{Hz}| = 4 \, \text{Hz}
\]

Thus, the correct answer is **F: 4 Hz**.
