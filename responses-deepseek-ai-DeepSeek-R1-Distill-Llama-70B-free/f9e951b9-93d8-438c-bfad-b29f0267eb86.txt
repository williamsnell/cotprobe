Okay, so I've got this question here about Brittany and the charity stickers. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

Alright, the question says that Brittany used address stickers sent by a charity, and then she felt obligated to mail a donation. The question is asking which psychological concept this illustrates.

First, I need to remember what each of these options refers to. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Stereotyping. That's when you judge people based on a group they belong to. Doesn't seem to fit here because Brittany's action is about reciprocity, not judging people.

Option B: The reciprocity norm. Oh right, reciprocity is about feeling obliged to return a favor. So if someone does something for you, you feel like you should do something back. That sounds exactly like what's happening here. The charity sent her stickers, so she feels she should donate.

Option C: The halo effect. That's when you like one thing about someone and assume everything else is good too. Like if a teacher is nice, you think they're good at their job. Not relevant here.

Option D: The bystander effect. That's when people don't help because others are around, thinking someone else will do it. Doesn't fit this scenario at all.

Option E: The door-in-the-face technique. That's a persuasion tactic where someone makes a big request, you refuse, then they make a smaller one. Like asking for $50, you say no, so they ask for $20. But here, the charity sent something first, and she responded. Not quite the same.

Option F: Cognitive dissonance theory. This is when you have conflicting thoughts and feel discomfort, so you change your behavior to reduce it. Brittany might feel guilty if she doesn't donate, but I'm not sure if this is the best fit. Reciprocity seems more direct.

Option G: The just-world phenomenon. That's believing the world is fair, and people get what they deserve. If Brittany donates because she feels the world is just, maybe, but the scenario seems more about obligation from receiving something.

Option H: Self-serving bias. When you attribute your successes to yourself and failures to others. Doesn't fit here.

Option I: Fundamental attribution error. That's when you overemphasize personality and ignore situations. Not relevant here.

Option J: Mere exposure effect. Liking something because you've been exposed to it. Doesn't apply here.

So putting it all together, Brittany feels obligated to donate after receiving the stickers. That obligation stems from the reciprocity norm, which is the social norm where we feel we should reciprocate when someone does something nice for us. So the correct answer is B.
</think>

The scenario describes Brittany feeling obligated to donate after receiving address stickers from a charity. This behavior aligns with the reciprocity norm, a social norm where individuals feel compelled to reciprocate when someone provides them with something. 

- **A**: Stereotyping is unrelated as it involves judging groups, not reciprocal actions.
- **B**: The reciprocity norm fits perfectly, as Brittany feels obliged to return the favor after receiving the stickers.
- **C**: The halo effect involves positive assumptions about a person, which isn't relevant here.
- **D**: The bystander effect pertains to helping behavior in groups, not applicable.
- **E**: The door-in-the-face technique involves sequential requests, not the act of reciprocation.
- **F**: Cognitive dissonance could explain guilt but isn't as direct as reciprocity.
- **G**: The just-world phenomenon isn't about reciprocal obligations.
- **H**: Self-serving bias and **I**: fundamental attribution error are unrelated to the scenario.
- **J**: The mere exposure effect involves liking through exposure, not reciprocation.

Thus, Brittany's actions are best explained by the reciprocity norm.

Answer: B
