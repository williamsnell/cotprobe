Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading through it carefully.

The question says: "If real GNP is expanding at a steady annual rate of 2 percent and the nominal money stock at a steady annual rate of 5 percent, what is the effect on the average price level if the income velocity of circulation of money is unchanged?"

Hmm. I remember that this has to do with the demand for money and how it affects price levels over time. I think I should probably use the quantity theory of money here. Let me recall that theory.

The quantity theory of money is often expressed by the equation MV = PY, right? Where M is the money supply, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level, and Y is the real output (which in this case is GNP). So the equation is M multiplied by V equals P multiplied by Y.

The question states that income velocity (V) is unchanged, so V is constant. That means any changes in M and Y will directly affect P. Since V is constant, we can rearrange the equation to solve for P. Let me write that down:

P = (M * V) / Y

But since V is constant, the changes in P depend on the changes in M and Y. So if M is growing at a certain rate and Y is growing at another, the rate of change of P would be the difference between the two growth rates.

Wait, no, I think it's the rate of change in M minus the rate of change in Y, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. If M grows faster than Y, that should cause inflation because there's more money chasing the same amount of goods. So the price level would rise.

In this problem, M is growing at 5% annually and Y (real GNP) is growing at 2%. So the difference is 5% - 2% = 3%. So does that mean the price level increases by 3% each year?

Let me double-check. If M increases by 5% and Y by 2%, then (M/V) increases by 5%, and since Y is only up 2%, the ratio (M/V)/Y would be (5% - 2%) = 3% increase in P. So the average price level should increase by 3% annually.

Looking at the options, option I is 3 percent. So the answer should be I.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes I mix up whether it's M growth minus Y growth or the other way around. Let me think again. If M grows faster than Y, then PY must grow by the same rate as MV. Since V is constant, MV is M times constant V. So if M is growing at 5%, MV is growing at 5%. Y is growing at 2%, so PY must grow at 5%. Therefore, since Y is 2%, P must be growing at 5% - 2% = 3%. Yep, that makes sense. So P increases by 3% each year.

To determine the effect on the average price level, we use the quantity theory of money, expressed as:

\[
MV = PY
\]

where \( M \) is the money supply, \( V \) is the velocity of money, \( P \) is the price level, and \( Y \) is real output (GNP). Since the income velocity of money (\( V \)) is unchanged, we can focus on the relationship between \( M \), \( Y \), and \( P \). Rearranging the equation to solve for \( P \), we get:

\[
P = \frac{M}{Y}
\]

Given that \( M \) is growing at an annual rate of 5% and \( Y \) is growing at an annual rate of 2%, the rate of change of \( P \) is determined by the difference in their growth rates:

\[
\text{Rate of change of } P = \text{Rate of change of } M - \text{Rate of change of } Y
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{Rate of change of } P = 5\% - 2\% = 3\%
\]

Thus, the average price level increases by 3% annually. The correct answer is:

**I: 3 percent**
