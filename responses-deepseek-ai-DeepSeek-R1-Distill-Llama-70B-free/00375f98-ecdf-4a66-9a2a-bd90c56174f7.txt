Okay, so I have this logic problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to predicate logic, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about translating an English sentence into predicate logic, and I need to choose the correct option from A to E.

The sentence given is: "José introduces Wilma to Kevin." The symbols provided are j for José, k for Kevin, w for Wilma, and the predicate Ixyz, which stands for x introduces y to z.

Alright, first, I need to understand the structure of the predicate Ixyz. It's a three-place predicate, meaning it takes three arguments. The order is important here. The way it's defined, Ixyz translates to x introduces y to z. So the first argument is the subject who is doing the introducing, the second is the person being introduced, and the third is the person to whom they're being introduced.

Now, breaking down the sentence: "José introduces Wilma to Kevin." So, José is the one doing the action, which is introducing. The action is introducing Wilma (so Wilma is the one being introduced) to Kevin (the person she's being introduced to).

So, mapping this to the predicate Ixyz:

- x is the introducer, which is José (j).
- y is the one being introduced, which is Wilma (w).
- z is the person to whom they're introduced, which is Kevin (k).

Putting it together, the predicate should be Ijwk. Let me double-check that. x is José, y is Wilma, z is Kevin. So I(j, w, k), which is Ijwk.

Looking at the options:

A: Ijkw → x=j, y=k, z=w → That would mean José introduces Kevin to Wilma. Not the case here.

B: Iwkj → x=w, y=k, z=j → Wilma introduces Kevin to José. No, that's not right.

C: Iwjk → x=w, y=j, z=k → Wilma introduces José to Kevin. Nope.

D: Ijwk → x=j, y=w, z=k → José introduces Wilma to Kevin. That's exactly our sentence.

E: Ikjw → x=k, y=j, z=w → Kevin introduces José to Wilma. Not correct.

So the correct option is D.

The correct translation into predicate logic for the sentence "José introduces Wilma to Kevin" is Ijwk, where José (j) is the introducer, Wilma (w) is the one being introduced, and Kevin (k) is the person to whom she is introduced.

Answer: D
