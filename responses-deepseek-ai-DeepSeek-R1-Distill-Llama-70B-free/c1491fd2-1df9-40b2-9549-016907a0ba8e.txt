Okay, let's try to figure out this physics problem. So the question is about a spring-block oscillator and the maximum speed of the block. I remember that in simple harmonic motion, like with a mass-spring system, the motion is sinusoidal.

Hmm, the question asks about the maximum speed in relation to the amplitude. I think the maximum speed occurs when the block is passing through the equilibrium point, right? Because that's where all the energy is kinetic, none is potential. 

Wait, I remember the formula for the speed in SHM is something like v = ωA sin(ωt + φ), but maybe that's not exactly right. Or is it v = ω√(A² - x²) or something like that? Oh wait, maybe the maximum velocity is when x is zero, so the velocity is maximum. So the maximum velocity v_max would be ω times the amplitude A.

Wait, ω is the angular frequency. And for a spring-block system, ω is sqrt(k/m), where k is the spring constant and m is the mass. So v_max is A multiplied by sqrt(k/m). 

So if we're looking at how v_max relates to A, it's directly proportional. Because if A increases, v_max increases linearly. So the maximum speed is proportional to the amplitude. Let me check the options.

Options are A to J. Option C says proportional to amplitude, which would fit. So the answer should be C.

But wait, I should make sure I didn't mix anything up. Another way to think about it is energy conservation. The potential energy in the spring is (1/2)kA² at maximum displacement. This potential energy converts entirely into kinetic energy (1/2)mv² at the equilibrium point. So setting them equal:

(1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv²

Simplifying, v² = (k/m)A². Taking square roots, v = sqrt(k/m) * A. Oh wait, but sqrt(k/m) is ω, so v_max = ωA. So yeah, v is directly proportional to A. So option C is correct.

In a spring-block oscillator, the maximum speed of the block occurs when the block passes through the equilibrium point, where all the energy is kinetic. The relationship between the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) and the amplitude \( A \) can be derived using the principles of simple harmonic motion and energy conservation.

From energy conservation, the potential energy stored in the spring at maximum displacement, \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \), is entirely converted into kinetic energy at the equilibrium point, \( \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \). Equating these gives:

\[
\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \cdot A
\]

Here, \( \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \) is the angular frequency \( \omega \), so \( v_{\text{max}} = \omega A \). This shows that the maximum speed is directly proportional to the amplitude \( A \).

Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**C: proportional to amplitude**
