Okay, so I've got this question here about linguistics terms, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking about the rules that govern the placement of words and phrases in a sentence. Hmm, I remember that linguistics has several branches, each dealing with different aspects of language.

Let's go through the options one by one. 

Option A is Semiotics. I think semiotics is the study of signs and symbols, not specifically about sentence structure. So probably not A.

Option B is Phonology. That's the study of sounds in language, right? Like how sounds are organized and used. Doesn't seem related to word placement.

Option C is Lexicology. That's about the study of words and their meanings. So more about vocabulary than sentence structure.

Option D is Pragmatics. I remember that's about how context affects meaning. Like, how the same sentence can have different meanings depending on the situation. Not about the placement of words.

Option E is Grammar. Wait, grammar is a broad term that includes the rules of a language, including syntax and morphology. But the question specifically mentions the placement of words and phrases, which might be a subset of grammar.

Option F is Orthography. That's about spelling and how words are written. Definitely not about sentence structure.

Option G is Phonemes. Those are the smallest units of sound in a language. Not related to word order.

Option H is Syntax. Oh, right! Syntax is the part of grammar that deals with how words and phrases are arranged to form sentences. That sounds exactly like what the question is asking about.

Option I is Morphology. That's the study of the structure of words, like how they're formed from morphemes. Not about the order in a sentence.

Option J is Semantics. That's about meaning in language, both word meaning and sentence meaning. But again, not about the placement of words.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be H: Syntax.

The correct answer is H: Syntax.
