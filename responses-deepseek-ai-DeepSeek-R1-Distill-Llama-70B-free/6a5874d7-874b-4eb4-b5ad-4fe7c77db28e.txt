Okay, I'm trying to figure out this statistics question. It's about confidence intervals and what affects the margin of error. Hmm, let me think. So the question is asking which of the given options would result in a smaller margin of error when estimating monthly grocery expenditures.

The question has three statements: I, II, and III. Let me go through each one.

Statement I says a smaller confidence level. Wait, confidence level is like the percentage, right? Like a 95% confidence interval. I remember that a higher confidence level means a wider interval because you're more confident, so you need a bigger range to be more sure. So if the confidence level is smaller, say from 95% to 90%, the margin of error should decrease. So I think statement I is correct.

Statement II is a smaller sample standard deviation. Oh, right, the formula for margin of error involves the standard deviation. The formula is something like (Z or t score) multiplied by (standard deviation divided by square root of n). So if the standard deviation is smaller, the margin of error would definitely be smaller. So II is correct.

Statement III is a smaller sample size. Wait, the formula includes sample size in the denominator under a square root. So if sample size n decreases, the denominator gets smaller, making the whole fraction bigger. That means the margin of error increases. So if n is smaller, the margin is larger, not smaller. So statement III would make the margin of error larger, not smaller. So III is incorrect.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. If the sample size increases, the square root of n increases, which would decrease the margin of error. So a larger n leads to smaller MOE. So if sample size is smaller (like n decreases), then MOE increases. So statement III says a smaller sample size, which would lead to larger MOE, not smaller. So statement III is wrong.

So the correct options are I and II.

Now looking at the options provided:

Option A: I and II. That's correct based on my reasoning.

Wait, but what about the options? Let me check again. The options are A through J, but I'll just list them:

Options:

A: I and II

B: II and II (That's probably a typo, maybe II and III? But it's written as II and II which doesn't make sense.)

C: I, II, and III

D: II and III

E: I and III

F: II only

G: I and I (Again, maybe a typo.)

H: III only

I: I only

J: III and III

So the correct statements are I and II, which is option A.

To determine which factors result in a smaller margin of error for a confidence interval estimate, let us analyze the given statements:

1. **Statement I: A smaller confidence level.**  
   A smaller confidence level (e.g., reducing from 95% to 90%) decreases the margin of error because a lower confidence level requires a narrower range to be less certain. Therefore, this statement is correct.

2. **Statement II: A smaller sample standard deviation.**  
   The margin of error is directly proportional to the sample standard deviation. A smaller sample standard deviation reduces the margin of error. Thus, this statement is also correct.

3. **Statement III: A smaller sample size.**  
   The margin of error is inversely proportional to the square root of the sample size. A smaller sample size increases the margin of error, not decreases it. Hence, this statement is incorrect.

From the analysis, only Statements I and II are correct. Among the provided options, **Option A (I and II)** matches this conclusion.
