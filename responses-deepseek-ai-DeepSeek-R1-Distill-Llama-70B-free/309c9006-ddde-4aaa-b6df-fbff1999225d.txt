Okay, so I've got this question about the cell cycle, and I'm a bit rusty on my biology, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking during which phase the quantity of DNA in a eukaryotic cell typically doubles. The options are from A to J, each corresponding to different phases or checkpoints in the cell cycle.

First, I remember that the cell cycle has several phases: G1, S, G2, and then M (mitosis), followed by cytokinesis. But wait, sometimes G1, S, and G2 are considered part of the interphase. Right, interphase is the longest phase where the cell grows, replicates DNA, and prepares for cell division.

So, when does DNA replication happen? I think DNA replication occurs during the S phase. Because S stands for synthesis, where the DNA is synthesized. So during S phase, each chromosome, which is made of one DNA molecule, replicates into two sister chromatids. So the DNA content doubles because each chromosome now has two DNA molecules instead of one.

Wait, but the question is about the quantity of DNA in the cell. So if each chromosome goes from one to two DNA molecules, the total DNA in the cell would double. So the phase when this happens is the S phase. 

Looking at the options, option I is S. So the answer should be I. But wait, let me make sure I'm not confusing the phases. Let me think again: G1 is the first gap phase where the cell grows and prepares for DNA replication. Then comes S phase where DNA is replicated. So during S phase, the DNA amount doubles. 

Other phases don't involve DNA replication. Mitosis (M phase) is when the chromosomes are divided into two daughter cells. So the DNA is already doubled before mitosis starts. So during mitosis, the DNA is being split but not doubled. 

Wait, the question is about when the quantity of DNA in the cell typically doubles. So it's during the S phase. So the correct answer is I.

The cell cycle in eukaryotic cells includes phases such as G1, S, G2, and M (mitosis), with G1, S, and G2 being part of interphase. DNA replication occurs specifically during the S phase (synthesis phase), where each chromosome's single DNA molecule is replicated into two sister chromatids. This replication results in the total DNA content of the cell doubling. 

Analyzing the options, the S phase corresponds to option I. Other phases like G1, G2, and M involve preparation for DNA replication, checking for errors, and cell division, respectively, but do not involve DNA doubling. Therefore, the phase during which the DNA quantity doubles is the S phase.

Answer: I
