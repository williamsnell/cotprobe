Okay, I need to figure out the answer to this question about Hare's views on ethics and science. Let me start by recalling what I know about R.M. Hare and his philosophical ideas.

Hare was a moral philosopher known for his work in ethics, particularly his theory of universal prescriptivism. He often discussed the nature of moral statements and how they function in language. I remember that he compared ethics to other fields, like science, in terms of their methodology.

The question asks how Hare thinks ethics and science are similar. The options are A through H, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me go through each option.

Option A: Both are infallible and beyond questioning. That doesn't sound right. Science is all about questioning and revising theories, and ethics, especially in Hare's view, isn't about infallibility either. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B: Ethics guides science in its pursuit of knowledge. Hmm. I'm not sure. While ethics does influence scientific practices, like in bioethics or research ethics, I don't recall Hare emphasizing that as a similarity in their methods. Maybe it's more about structure or reasoning.

Option C: Both are essential for a worthwhile life. That could be a possibility, but I'm not certain. Hare might have thought of ethics as essential, but I'm not sure about the direct comparison to science in this way.

Option D: Both are completely separate and do not intersect. I don't think this is correct because Hare often drew parallels between the two fields, so they must have some similarities beyond being separate.

Option E: Both seek to provide true beliefs about the world. Science definitely does, but ethics is more about prescriptions rather than descriptions. So E might not be right.

Option F: Both involve testing general principles by examining their logical consequences. This rings a bell. In Hare's universal prescriptivism, moral principles are tested by considering their universal application and the logical consequences if everyone followed them. Similarly, in science, hypotheses are tested by their logical implications and empirical consequences. So F seems like a strong candidate.

Option G: All of the above. Well, since I've already dismissed some options, G can't be correct.

Option H: Both are based solely on personal opinions and beliefs. No, that's not right. Hare's approach is more about rational, universal principles in ethics, and science is based on evidence, not just opinions.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be F. Both ethics and science test their general principles by examining their logical consequences.

The correct answer is F: both involve testing general principles by examining their logical consequences.

Answer: F
