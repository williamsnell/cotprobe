Okay, so I've got this question about psychological studies on aggression and television programming. Hmm, I remember from my classes that there's a lot of research on how media affects behavior. Let me think.

The question is asking what most psychological studies imply about TV programming in relation to aggression. The options are A through J. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I recall that many studies have looked at the impact of watching violent TV on aggression. I think the general consensus is that exposure to violence on TV can increase aggressive behavior in viewers. Like, Albert Bandura's Bobo doll experiment showed that kids who watched someone being aggressive towards a doll were more likely to act aggressively themselves. So that's the social learning theory, right?

Looking at the options, option D says "Violent television increases aggression." That seems to align with what I remember. But wait, let me go through each option to make sure.

Option A: TV is the sole cause. That doesn't sound right because aggression has multiple factors like genetics, environment, upbringing, etc. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B: Aggression on TV promotes positive conflict resolution. That doesn't fit because if TV shows violence, it might teach aggressive ways to deal with conflict, not positive ones. So B is likely wrong.

Option C: Prosocial messages increase aggression. Wait, prosocial means positive, like helping others. So if TV shows prosocial stuff, it should decrease aggression, not increase. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Violent TV increases aggression. Yes, that fits with what I was thinking earlier. Bandura's work supports this.

Option E: TV increases passive behavior. Hmm, I'm not sure. I think some shows might make people less active, but the question is about aggression, not passivity. So E doesn't seem right.

Option F: Non-violent TV increases aggression. That doesn't make sense. If the TV isn't violent, why would it cause more aggression? Maybe the opposite.

Option G: TV reflects society but doesn't affect. I think this is more like the "mirror" theory, where media reflects what's happening, not causing it. But psychological studies suggest media can influence behavior, so G might not be correct.

Option H: TV reduces aggression. That's the opposite of what most studies say, so probably not H.

Option I: TV has no effect. That can't be right because there's a lot of research showing effects, especially from violence.

Option J: Effects are unknown. No, the studies have shown effects, so J is incorrect.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be D. Violent TV increases aggression. That's what most studies imply.

The results of most psychological studies on aggression suggest that exposure to violent television programming can increase aggressive behavior in viewers. This conclusion is supported by research such as Albert Bandura's Bobo doll experiment, which demonstrated that observing aggressive behavior on television can lead to imitation and increased aggression. Among the given options, the one that aligns with these findings is:

**D: Violent television increases aggression.**

Answer: D
