Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about Sinnott-Armstrong and his interests regarding moral obligations. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think it through carefully.

First off, I remember that Sinnott-Armstrong is a philosopher, but I'm not exactly sure what his specific focus is. I think he's written a lot on ethics and maybe something related to moral philosophy. I recall that he's done work on moral skepticism, which is the idea that moral statements can't be true or false in the same way factual statements can.

Wait, but the question is about who or what he examines in terms of moral obligations. The options are educational institutions, environmental entities, animals, governments, corporations, families, religious groups, technology companies, societies, or individuals.

I'm trying to remember any specific works by him. Oh, right! He's done work on the morality of capitalism and business ethics. I think he's written about whether corporations have moral obligations. That would fit with option E, corporations.

But wait, I also remember he's written about the moral responsibilities of individuals, especially in the context of skepticism. Maybe it's about whether individuals can have moral obligations if moral statements aren't objective. Hmm, that's a possibility too, which would point to option J, individuals.

I'm a bit confused now. Let me think again. Sinnott-Armstrong has edited books on various topics. One that comes to mind is "Moral Psychology," which deals with how people make moral decisions. But that's more about the psychology aspect rather than the entities themselves.

Wait, another angle: I think he's been involved in debates about the moral obligations of organizations versus individuals. He might argue that entities like corporations can have moral obligations, or perhaps he's critical of that idea. I'm not entirely sure, but I think his work does focus on whether these entities can be morally responsible.

Alternatively, I've heard him discuss the idea that even if moral statements aren't objective, people can still have moral obligations. That would tie into individuals, but I'm not certain if that's the primary focus of his work.

I'm a bit torn between E (corporations) and J (individuals). Let me try to recall any specific papers or books. Oh, right! He's written about the moral responsibilities of businesses and whether they can be held morally accountable. That would support option E.

But then again, another part of me thinks he's more focused on the individual level, especially in the context of moral responsibility and the implications of moral skepticism. If he's a skeptic, maybe he questions whether anyone, including individuals, can have moral obligations.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's go back to the question: the question is about whom he is most interested in examining. If I remember correctly, he's done a lot of work on the moral obligations of individuals, particularly in discussions about moral responsibility and whether individuals can be held accountable for their actions in a morally skeptical framework.

So, putting it all together, I think the answer is J: individuals.

The answer is J: individuals.
