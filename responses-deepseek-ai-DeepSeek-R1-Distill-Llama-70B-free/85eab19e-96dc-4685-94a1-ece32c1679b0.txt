Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about an electron being shot from the center of a spherical metal shell. The shell has a radius R and a surface charge density of 6.90e-13 C/m². The electron escapes through a tiny hole. We need to find the magnitude of the electron's acceleration when it's at a radial distance of 0.500 R, which is r = 0.5 R.

Hmm, right, so I remember that in these kinds of problems, especially with charged shells, the electric field inside a conducting shell is zero. But wait, this is a metal shell, so it's a conductor. So if the shell is negatively charged, the charge resides on the surface. But wait, the electron is shot from the center. So what's the electric field experienced by the electron as it moves outward?

Wait, thinking again. The shell is conducting, so any excess charge is on the surface. But the electron is starting from the center and moving outward. So when the electron is inside the shell (r < R), what's the electric field it experiences?

Oh right, in a conducting shell, the charges on the inner surface would induce an opposite charge if there's a charge inside. Wait, but in this case, the shell itself is charged. Wait, the shell has a surface charge density, which is negative. So the shell's surface has a negative charge.

But wait, the electron is inside the shell, moving outward. So when the electron is inside the conducting shell (r < R), the electric field inside the conducting material is zero. But wait, the electron is in the cavity, not the conductor. Oh right, the cavity is non-conducting, so the electric field inside the cavity depends on the charges on the inner surface of the shell.

Wait, no, the shell is a conductor, so the electric field inside the conductor is zero. But the cavity is a separate region. For a conducting shell with charge on its outer surface, the inner surface would have an induced charge if there's a charge inside the cavity. But in this problem, the shell's charge is given as surface charge density. Wait, surface charge density is given, but where is that charge located? On the outer surface or inner surface?

Wait, the problem says the shell is negatively charged with a surface charge density. So the surface charge is on the shell's surfaces. But for a conducting shell, any charge resides on the outer surface. Unless the shell is non-conducting, but wait, here it's a metal shell, so conducting. So the charge is on the outer surface.

So the shell's inner surface has no charge because the cavity is empty (no charge mentioned inside the cavity except the electron when it's moving through). Wait, but the electron is moving. So when the electron is inside the cavity, the shell's inner surface would have an induced charge. Let me think about that.

Wait, no. Because the shell is conducting, the charges on the shell will move. There's an electron inside the cavity (when it's moving through). So the inner surface of the shell would have an induced positive charge, and the outer surface would have the shell's original negative charge plus the induced negative charge? Hmm, no, wait, the shell has a net negative charge. Let me think again.

The shell's total charge is the sum of the inner and outer surface charges. So if the electron is in the cavity, the inner surface of the shell must have an induced charge of +e (since the electron is negative). But the shell as a whole has some negative charge. So the inner surface would have +e, and the outer surface would have the shell's total charge minus that.

Wait, the shell's total charge is Q = surface charge density (σ) times the surface area. The surface area of a sphere is 4πR². So Q = σ * 4πR².

But when the electron is inside the cavity, the inner surface must have an induced charge of +e (since the electron is -e). So the inner surface charge is +e, so the outer surface would have Q - (+e) → because the inner and outer surface charges add up to the total charge of the shell.

Wait, but wait, the shell's original charge is negative. Let's compute it.

σ = 6.90e-13 C/m². So Q = σ * 4πR².

But when the electron is inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conducting shell will have an induced charge of +e. So the outer surface will have charge Q - (+e). But wait, the shell's original charge is negative, so it's possible that the outer surface has more negative charge.

Wait, another approach: The cavity is inside the conductor. When the electron is at the center, moving outward, the electron is a point charge. In a conductor, charges rearrange. So the inner surface of the shell would have an induced charge of +e (to cancel the field inside the conductor). Since the shell is conducting, the outer surface must have the shell's original charge plus the charge that's not induced. Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating this.

Wait, but wait, the shell's charge is given as a surface charge density. So if the shell is charged, then in its neutral state, the inner and outer surfaces might have charges. But if the shell's overall charge is negative, then when an electron is inside the cavity, the inner surface must have an induced positive charge of +e, and the outer surface will have σ times 4πR² minus this +e?

Wait, no, because the shell's total charge is σ × surface area. The surface area is 4πR², so Q_shell = σ × 4π R².

When the electron is inside the cavity, the inner surface of the shell must have a charge +e (since the inner surface of a conductor must have charges induced by any charge within the cavity). So the inner surface has +e, and the outer surface must have the rest of the charge to make the shell's total charge Q_shell.

So the outer surface charge is Q_shell - inner surface charge → Q_outer = Q_shell - (+e).

But in this problem, the shell's charge is given as a surface charge density, which is probably considering the outer surface because that's where the charge resides when there's no charge inside the cavity.

Wait, but when there's a charge inside the cavity, the inner surface will have an induced charge, and the outer surface's charge will adjust accordingly. So for the purposes of the electric field outside the shell, it's the outer surface charge that matters. But for the electric field inside the cavity, the inner surface's charge contributes.

Wait, but in this problem, the electron is moving through the cavity, so the question is about the electric field within the cavity at r = 0.5 R. So what's the electric field at that point due to the charges on the shell?

Wait, but the shell is a conductor, and the cavity is empty except for the electron. So the electric field in the cavity arises from the inner surface charge. Because in a conductor, the electric field inside the conductor is zero, and the field inside the cavity is due to the inner surface charges.

But wait, the inner surface charge is +e (because the electron is -e inside the cavity). So the field inside the cavity would be as if a point charge +e is located at the center?

No, wait, the inner surface of the shell has a charge distribution. For a spherical shell, if the inner surface has charge +e, then the field inside the cavity (at r < R) would be the same as that produced by a point charge +e at the center. Because of the shell theorem, a spherically symmetric charge distribution behaves as if the charge is at the center.

So the electric field inside the cavity (r < R) due to the inner surface charge is E = (k * q) / r², where q is +e.

But wait, the shell's inner surface has charge +e, so the field in the cavity is like that of a point charge. So the field at r = 0.5 R is E = k*(e)/( (0.5 R)^2 ) = (k e) / (0.25 R²) ) = 4 k e / R².

But wait, the electron is moving in this field. So the acceleration is due to the electric field.

But wait, the field is created by the inner surface charge, which is +e. So the direction of the field is radially outward, because a positive charge would create an outward field. However, the electron has a negative charge, so the force on it is opposite to the field direction, which would be inward. But wait, the question asks for the magnitude of the acceleration, so direction doesn't matter.

Wait, but the shell's own charge (the outer surface) also contributes. Wait, the outer surface's charge is Q_outer = Q_shell - inner_charge.

But the electric field inside the cavity is only due to the inner surface charge. Because, according to the shell theorem, charges outside a shell do not contribute to the electric field inside the cavity. So the outer surface charge, which is outside the shell (for the cavity), doesn't affect the field within the cavity. So the field at r = 0.5 R is only due to the inner surface charge, which is +e.

Wait, but the shell is negatively charged. So the shell's total charge is negative. So when the electron is inside, the inner surface has +e, so the outer surface must have (shell's charge) – (+e) = negative charge.

But wait, the shell's charge is negative. So let's compute the shell's charge.

σ = 6.90e-13 C/m².

Surface area for radius R is 4π R², so Q_shell = σ * 4 π R² = 6.90e-13 C/m² * 4 π R².

Wait, but when the electron is inside the cavity, the inner surface has +e. So the outer surface has Q_outer = Q_shell - (+e) → but since Q_shell is negative, this would make the outer surface even more negative.

But for the field in the cavity, only the inner surface's charge matters. So the electric field in the cavity is E = (k * e) / r².

Wait, so at r = 0.5 R, E = (k e) / ( (0.5 R)^2 ) = (k e) / ( (R²)/4 ) ) = 4 k e / R².

Wait, but what is the direction of this field? It's radially outward because it's due to a positive charge on the inner surface. So the force on the electron (which is negative) is opposite to E, which is inward. But the question only asks for the magnitude.

So the acceleration is a = F/m = (e E) / m.

Wait, let me compute that.

But wait, the force on the electron is F = e * E, but since E is the field due to the inner surface charge (positive), the force on the electron is F = (-e) * E (because electric field is force per unit positive charge). Wait, no: F = q E. The electron has q = -e, so F = (-e) * E. But E is the field due to the inner surface, which is +e, so E is radially outward. So F is radially inward. But again, the question is about magnitude.

So the magnitude of acceleration is (e E)/m.

Wait, let's plug in the numbers.

But wait, hold on. I'm a bit confused because the shell has its own charge. So the inner surface has +e, but the shell's outer surface has Q_shell - e.

But in the cavity, the electric field is due to the inner surface only. So E = (k * e) / r².

Wait, but what about the shell's own charge? For example, if the shell had a charge without any cavity, the field inside would be zero. But when the cavity is present and contains a charge, the inner surface adjusts.

So in this problem, the field experienced by the electron is due to the inner surface's induced charge. So E is (k e) / r².

So the acceleration a is (e E)/m_e.

But wait, the acceleration would then be a = (e * (k e / r² )) / m_e.

So computing that:

e = 1.6e-19 C

k = 8.99e9 N m²/C²

m_e = 9.11e-31 kg

r = 0.5 R. Hmm, but R is given as the radius of the shell. But since it's a variable, perhaps R will cancel out.

Wait, let me see.

So a = (e * (k e / r² )) / m_e = (k e²) / (m_e r² )

But r is 0.5 R, so r² = (0.25 R² )

So,

a = (k e²) / ( m_e * 0.25 R² ) ) = (4 k e²) / (m_e R² )

But wait, wait a second. The problem gives the surface charge density of the shell, which is σ = 6.90e-13 C/m².

So the total charge on the shell is Q_shell = σ * 4 π R².

Wait, earlier I thought that the inner surface's charge is +e, but that might not be correct because the shell's own charge (negative) might influence things.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

The shell is a conductor with a total charge Q, which is negative. The electron is inside the cavity. So the inner surface of the shell will have an induced charge of +e (to cancel the field inside the conductor from the electron). Therefore, the inner surface has +e. The outer surface must then have charge Q - (+e). Because the total charge is Q = inner + outer.

But wait, the shell's charge is Q = σ * 4 π R². So:

Q_outer = Q - Q_inner → Q_outer = σ *4 π R² - e.

But when considering the electric field inside the cavity (r < R), only the inner surface charge contributes. So at r = 0.5 R, the electric field is E_inner = (k * e) / r².

So the acceleration of the electron is a = (e E) / m_e = e/(m_e) * (k e)/r² = (k e²) / (m_e r² )

But wait, substituting r = 0.5 R → r² = 0.25 R².

So,

a = (k e²) / ( m_e * 0.25 R² ) )

= (4 k e²) / ( m_e R² )

Now, let me compute this.

But wait, I don't know R. So perhaps I'm missing something. Because in the problem, the answer depends on the given surface charge density. So maybe I'm not considering the field from the shell's own charge correctly.

Wait, another approach: The electric field inside a conducting shell's cavity, when the shell itself carries a charge, is only due to the cavity's contents and the inner surface. But in this case, the electron is in the cavity, so the inner surface adjusts.

Wait, perhaps the shell's own charge doesn't affect the electric field inside the cavity. Because, for a conducting shell, any charge on the shell resides on the outer surface, unless there's a charge inside the cavity, which induces an opposite charge on the inner surface.

Wait, but in our case, the shell is charged with a surface charge density, which implies it's the outer surface. So the inner surface's charge is due to the presence of the electron.

Wait, perhaps the shell's charge (due to σ) is on the outer surface. So when the electron is inside the cavity, the inner surface must have +e, and the outer surface has Q_outer = Q_shell - e.

But again, the electric field in the cavity is only due to the inner surface's charge. So E = k e / r².

Wait, but why is the shell's charge important then? Because the surface charge density is given, but in the calculation, R cancels out. So maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the shell's charge creates an electric field outside the shell, but inside the cavity, the field is due to the inner surface. So the field in the cavity is solely from the inner surface's induced charge.

But let's proceed with the calculation.

Compute a = (k e²) / ( m_e r² )

But wait, r is 0.5 R. So a = (4 k e²) / ( m_e R² )

But the problem gives us the surface charge density, σ. How is that connected?

Ah, perhaps because the shell's charge affects the inner surface's charge. Wait, no. Because the inner surface's charge is induced by the electron, regardless of the shell's charge.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the shell's surface charge density has nothing to do with the field inside the cavity because it's on the outer surface. So the field in the cavity is due to the inner surface's induced charge, which is +e.

So the acceleration is (k e²) / ( m_e r² )

But we can express R in terms of the shell's charge. Because the shell's charge is Q_shell = σ * 4 π R². But in our calculation, a depends on R². So unless the shell's charge is connected, perhaps there's another approach.

Wait, but in the calculation for a, R is present. So without knowing R, how can we find a numerical answer? Unless another approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the field inside the cavity. Maybe the shell's charge also contributes to the field in the cavity. No, that can't be right. Because in a conductor, the electric field inside is zero. So the cavity's field is due to the inner surface's charge. The outer surface's charge contributes to the field outside the shell, but not inside.

Wait, but the shell's own charge (on the outer surface) doesn't affect the cavity. So the field at r=0.5 R is due to the inner surface's +e charge.

So the acceleration calculation is as before.

But the problem gives us σ, which is the surface charge density of the shell. So perhaps I need to connect that to the induced charges.

Wait, Q_shell = σ * 4 π R². But when the electron is inside the cavity, the inner surface charge is +e, so the outer surface is Q_shell - (+e).

But wait, how does that affect the electron's acceleration? I think it doesn't, because the field in the cavity is only due to the inner surface.

Wait, but maybe I'm supposed to consider the shell's own electric field as well. Hmm, that seems conflicting with what I know about conductors.

Another thought: If the shell is negatively
