Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the loss of head in a pipe. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on fluid mechanics, but let me think.

The pipe is 1/4 inch in diameter and 16 feet long. Water flows at half the critical velocity. Oh right, critical velocity is when the Reynolds number is 2500. They give mu as 1.01 centipoise, which is 0.679e-3 lbm/ft-sec. I think I remember that centipoise is 0.01 Poise, and 1 Poise is 1 dyne-sec/cm². But I'm a bit confused about the units here. Oh wait, the problem already converted it to lbm/ft-sec, so that's good.

So first, I need to find the critical velocity. Reynolds number Re is 2500. The formula for Reynolds number is Re = (VDρ)/μ, where V is velocity, D is diameter, rho is density, mu is viscosity.

Wait, but since we're dealing with critical velocity, V_c is when Re is exactly 2500. So V_c = (Re * μ) / (D * ρ). But wait, I need to make sure all the units are consistent.

The pipe diameter D is given in inches. I think I should convert that to feet because the length is in feet and the viscosity is in lbm/ft-sec. So 1/4 inch is 0.25 inches, which is 0.25/12 feet = 0.0208333 feet.

The density of water, rho, I think is about 62.4 lbm/ft³. Let me confirm that. Yeah, at standard conditions, water is roughly 62.4 lbm per cubic foot.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check: water is about 1000 kg/m³, which converts to 62.4 lbm/ft³. Yeah, that's right.

So now, V_c = (Re * μ) / (D * rho). Plugging the numbers in:

Re is 2500, mu is 0.679e-3 lbm/ft-sec, D is 0.0208333 ft, rho is 62.4 lbm/ft³.

V_c = (2500 * 0.679e-3) / (0.0208333 * 62.4)

Let me compute the numerator first: 2500 * 0.679e-3. 0.679e-3 is 0.000679. So 2500 * 0.000679 = 1.6975.

Denominator: 0.0208333 * 62.4 = let's see, 0.0208333 is 1/48 ft. 62.4 /48 = approximately 1.3. Wait, 48 * 1.3 is 62.4? Let me compute: 48 * 1.3 is 62.4, yes. So denominator is 1.3.

So V_c = 1.6975 / 1.3 ≈ 1.3062 ft/s.

But wait, the flow is at half the critical velocity, so V = 0.5 * V_c = 0.5 * 1.3062 ≈ 0.6531 ft/s.

Now, I need to find the head loss, h_f. The formula for head loss due to friction is h_f = (f * L * V²) / (2gD), where f is the friction factor. But since the flow is at half the critical velocity, which is in the laminar regime, I think the flow is definitely laminar here. Because critical velocity is the threshold between laminar and turbulent. So if V is half of V_c, then Re would be 2500/2=1250, which is still in the laminar range. For laminar flow, friction factor f is 64/Re.

Wait, right! In laminar flow, f = 64 / Re. So since Re here is (V D rho)/mu.

Wait, I can compute Re now. Let me compute that. V is 0.6531 ft/s, D is 0.020833 ft, rho is 62.4, mu is 0.679e-3.

Re = (0.6531 * 0.020833 * 62.4) / (0.679e-3)

Let me calculate numerator: 0.6531 * 0.020833 ≈ 0.01362 (since 0.6531 * 0.02 is ~0.01306, and a bit more for 0.000833). Then multiply by 62.4: 0.01362 *62.4 ≈ 0.850.

Denominator: 0.679e-3 is 0.000679.

So Re ≈ 0.850 / 0.000679 ≈ 1252. So yes, Re is about 1250, which makes sense because V is half V_c, so Re is half of 2500.

So f = 64 / Re = 64 / 1252 ≈ 0.0511.

Now, calculate h_f. The formula is h_f = (f L V²) / (2gD).

Wait, L is 16 ft, V is 0.6531 ft/s, D is 0.020833 ft, g is 32.2 ft/s².

So plug in the numbers:

h_f = (0.0511 * 16 * (0.6531)^2) / (2 * 32.2 * 0.020833 )

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute numerator:

0.0511 * 16 = 0.8176.

(0.6531)^2 ≈ 0.4263.

Multiply 0.8176 * 0.4263 = approx 0.3485.

Denominator: 2 * 32.2 = 64.4, multiplied by 0.020833.

0.020833 * 64.4 ≈ 1.341.

So h_f ≈ 0.3485 / 1.341 ≈ 0.26 ft.

Wait, 0.26 feet. But the options are in inches. Since 1 ft is 12 inches, 0.26 ft is 3.12 inches.

Looking at the options: Option A is 3.12 in, so that's the answer. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have messed up somewhere.

Wait a second, let me recalculate the denominator in the h_f formula.

Denominator: 2 * g * D.

So 2 * 32.2 ft/s² * 0.020833 ft = 64.4 * 0.020833 ≈ 1.341 ft²/s².

Yes, correct.

Numerator: f * L * V².

f is 0.0511, L is 16 ft, V² is (0.6531)^2 ≈ 0.4263.

0.0511 * 16 = 0.8176.

0.8176 * 0.4263 ≈ 0.3485 ft²/s².

So 0.3485 / 1.341 ≈ 0.26 ft, which is 3.12 inches. So option A.

But wait, I thought about units again. Let me make sure.

Wait, the viscosity mu was given as 0.679e-3 lbm/ft-sec. Did I use that correctly in the Re calculation?

Yes, because Re is unitless, so mu is in lbm/ft-s, D in ft, rho in lbm/ft³, V in ft/s. So (lbm/ft-s) * ft * lbm/ft³ ) / lbm/ft-s. Hmm, perhaps I should recheck the units for Re.

Wait, Re = (V D rho) / mu.

V = ft/s, D=ft, rho=lbm/ft³, mu=lbm/ft-hr? Wait, no, mu is given in lbm/ft-sec.

Wait, lbm/ft-sec is correct for dynamic viscosity in imperial units.

So units: (ft/s * ft * lbm/ft³) / (lbm/ft-s) )

Multiply numerator: ft^2/s * lbm/ft³ = (ft^2 * lbm) ) / (s * ft³) )= (lbm) / (s * ft).

Denominator: lbm/(ft-s).

So (lbm/(s*ft)) ) / (lbm/(ft s)) ) = (1/(s ft)) ) * (ft s /1 ) ) = dimensionless. So units are correct.

So Re is indeed unitless.

So my calculation seems correct.

Wait, but another approach: sometimes, head loss is calculated using the Hagen-Poiseuille equation for laminar flow, which is h_f = (32 μ L V) / (g D² rho). Wait, is that another way to compute it? Because Hagen-Poiseuille is for laminar flow.

Let me try that formula.

h_f = (32 * mu * L * V ) / (g * D^2 * rho )

Plugging in the numbers:

mu = 0.679e-3 lbm/ft-s.

L =16 ft.

V=0.6531 ft/s.

g=32.2 ft/s².

D=0.020833 ft.

rho=62.4 lbm/ft³.

So numerator: 32 * 0.679e-3 *16 *0.6531.

Denominator: 32.2 * (0.020833)^2 * 62.4.

Compute the numerator:

32 * 0.000679 = 0.021708.

0.021708 *16 = 0.347312.

0.347312 *0.6531 ≈ 0.3473 *0.65 is about 0.226, and 0.3473 *0.0031 is ~0.001076, so total approx 0.2271.

Denominator: 32.2 * (0.020833)^2 *62.4.

Compute each part:

(0.020833)^2 ≈ 0.000434.

32.2 *0.000434 ≈ 0.01395.

0.01395 *62.4 ≈ 0.871.

So h_f ≈ 0.2271 / 0.871 ≈ 0.261 ft, which is the same as before, 3.13 inches. So option A is correct.

Wait, but why is the calculation the same? Because the formula is another expression for the same thing. Because the friction factor f is 64/Re, so when you express h_f in terms of f, it's the same as using the Hagen-Poiseuille equation.

So both methods give the same result, about 3.12 inches.

Looking at the options, option A is 3.12 in.

So the answer should be A.

To calculate the loss of head in the pipe, we start by determining the critical velocity, \( V_c \), which occurs when the Reynolds number (\( Re \)) is 2500. The formula for Reynolds number is:

\[
Re = \frac{V D \rho}{\mu}
\]

Rearranging for \( V_c \):

\[
V_c = \frac{Re \cdot \mu}{D \cdot \rho}
\]

Given:
- \( Re = 2500 \)
- \( \mu = 0.679 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{lbm/ft-sec} \)
- \( D = \frac{1}{4} \, \text{in} = 0.020833 \, \text{ft} \)
- \( \rho = 62.4 \, \text{lbm/ft}^3 \)

Substituting:

\[
V_c = \frac{2500 \cdot 0.679 \times 10^{-3}}{0.020833 \cdot 62.4}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
2500 \cdot 0.679 \times 10^{-3} = 1.6975
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
0.020833 \cdot 62.4 = 1.3
\]

Thus:

\[
V_c = \frac{1.6975}{1.3} \approx 1.3062 \, \text{ft/s}
\]

Since the flow velocity is half the critical velocity:

\[
V = \frac{V_c}{2} = \frac{1.3062}{2} \approx 0.6531 \, \text{ft/s}
\]

Next, verify the Reynolds number for this velocity to confirm laminar flow:

\[
Re = \frac{V D \rho}{\mu}
\]

Substituting:

\[
Re = \frac{0.6531 \cdot 0.020833 \cdot 62.4}{0.679 \times 10^{-3}}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
0.6531 \cdot 0.020833 \cdot 62.4 \approx 0.850
\]

Then, divide by the denominator:

\[
Re = \frac{0.850}{0.679 \times 10^{-3}} \approx 1252
\]

Since \( Re < 2500 \), the flow is laminar, and the friction factor \( f \) is given by:

\[
f = \frac{64}{Re}
\]

Substituting \( Re = 1252 \):

\[
f = \frac{64}{1252} \approx 0.0511
\]

The head loss \( h_f \) is calculated using the formula:

\[
h_f = \frac{f \cdot L \cdot V^2}{2 \cdot g \cdot D}
\]

Given:
- \( L = 16 \, \text{ft} \)
- \( V = 0.6531 \, \text{ft/s} \)
- \( g = 32.2 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \)
- \( D = 0.020833 \, \text{ft} \)

Substituting:

\[
h_f = \frac{0.0511 \cdot 16 \cdot (0.6531)^2}{2 \cdot 32.2 \cdot 0.020833}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
0.0511 \cdot 16 = 0.8176, \quad (0.6531)^2 \approx 0.4263
\]

\[
0.8176 \cdot 0.4263 \approx 0.3485
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
2 \cdot 32.2 = 64.4, \quad 64.4 \cdot 0.020833 \approx 1.341
\]

Thus:

\[
h_f = \frac{0.3485}{1.341} \approx 0.26 \, \text{ft}
\]

Convert to inches:

\[
h_f = 0.26 \cdot 12 = 3.12 \, \text{in}
\]

Thus, the loss of head is **3.12 inches**, corresponding to **Option A**.
