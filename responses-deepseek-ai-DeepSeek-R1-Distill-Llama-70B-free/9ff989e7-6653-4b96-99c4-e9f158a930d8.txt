Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that both HCl and NaOH are strong electrolytes. I need to find the pH of the solution when 40 ml of 0.10 M NaOH is added to 10 ml of 0.45 M HCl. The options are from A to J.

Hmm, right. I remember that HCl is a strong acid and NaOH is a strong base, so they'll completely dissociate in water. When they react, the H+ from HCl will neutralize the OH- from NaOH. The reaction equation should be HCl + NaOH â†’ NaCl + H2O. Since both are strong, the reaction goes to completion.

First, I think I should calculate the moles of each reactant. Moles are calculated by multiplying concentration (M) by volume (L). 

For HCl: the volume is 10 ml, which is 0.010 L. The concentration is 0.45 M. So moles HCl = 0.45 * 0.010 = 0.0045 moles.

For NaOH: volume is 40 ml, 0.040 L. Concentration is 0.10 M. Moles NaOH = 0.10 * 0.040 = 0.004 moles.

Wait, wait. HCl and NaOH react in a 1:1 ratio. So HCl has 0.0045 moles and NaOH has 0.004. That means NaOH is the limiting reactant here because it has fewer moles. So after the reaction, some HCl will remain unreacted.

So the HCl will be in excess. Let me calculate how much. Moles HCl remaining = initial HCl moles - moles NaOH = 0.0045 - 0.004 = 0.0005 moles.

Now, I need to find the concentration of H+ from this excess HCl. Because HCl is a strong acid, it will completely dissociate, so [H+] equals the concentration of HCl left in solution.

First, find the total volume of the solution. The volumes add up: 10 ml + 40 ml = 50 ml, which is 0.050 L.

So the concentration of H+ is moles HCl remaining divided by total volume. That's 0.0005 / 0.050 = 0.01 M.

Wait, 0.01 M H+ means the pH is the negative log of that. pH = -log(0.01). Since 0.01 is 10^-2, log(0.01) is -2, so pH is 2. 

Looking at the options, option B is 2. So I think that's the answer.

Wait a second, let me double-check. Did I mix up the volumes somewhere? Let me recalculate. 

HCl moles: 0.45 * 0.010 = 0.0045. Correct.
NaOH moles: 0.10 * 0.040 = 0.004. Correct.

Excess HCl: 0.0045-0.004 = 0.0005. Right.

Total volume 0.05 L. Concentration: 0.0005 / 0.05 = 0.01 M H+. pH is -log(0.01)=2. Yep, that's right. So the answer must be B.

To determine the pH of the solution formed by adding 40 ml of 0.10 M NaOH to 10 ml of 0.45 M HCl, we first calculate the moles of each reactant:

- **Moles of HCl**:  
  \( 0.45 \, \text{M} \times 0.010 \, \text{L} = 0.0045 \, \text{moles} \)

- **Moles of NaOH**:  
  \( 0.10 \, \text{M} \times 0.040 \, \text{L} = 0.004 \, \text{moles} \)

Since HCl and NaOH react in a 1:1 ratio, NaOH is the limiting reactant. After the reaction, the remaining moles of HCl are:  
\( 0.0045 - 0.004 = 0.0005 \, \text{moles} \).

The total volume of the solution is:  
\( 10 \, \text{ml} + 40 \, \text{ml} = 50 \, \text{ml} = 0.050 \, \text{L} \).

The concentration of \( \text{H}^+ \) from the excess HCl is:  
\( \frac{0.0005 \, \text{moles}}{0.050 \, \text{L}} = 0.01 \, \text{M} \).

The pH is calculated as:  
\( \text{pH} = -\log(0.01) = 2 \).

Thus, the pH of the solution is **2**.
