Question:

After a party where the adults all drank alcohol, with everyone having at least six beers, they started up a game of baseball. The host supplied the bats, balls and gloves. An argument arose at home plate after a controversial call by the umpire, who was inebriated like all of the other participants. The host of the party became enraged at the umpire's decision and hit him in the face, breaking his nose. The umpire pressed charges when he became sober, and the authorities charged the host with criminal battery. At trial, the defense raised the defense of voluntary intoxication, arguing that the host lacked the mentality to form an intent to commit a criminal battery. Will the defense of voluntary intoxication be successful under these facts?

Options:

A: Yes, voluntary intoxication is always at least a partial defense to any crime that requires mens rea.
B: No, criminal battery in this case is a general intent crime and the defense of voluntary intoxication is not available.
C: No, because the host was the organizer of the party and should have had control over the situation.
D: No, the host was grossly negligent in allowing a group of drunk men to play a dangerous game of hardball, which precluded him from the benefit of the defense.
E: Yes, criminal battery is a specific intent crime to which voluntary intoxication may be asserted as a defense.
F: No, because the host willingly drank the alcohol and should have known the possible consequences.
G: Yes, because the umpire was also intoxicated and could have misjudged the situation.
H: No, because the host used excessive force in a situation that did not warrant it.
I: Yes, because the umpire provoked the host by making an unfair call.
J: Yes, because the host was not in his right mind due to the alcohol.

Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. So, the scenario is about a party where adults drank a lot of alcohol, and then they played baseball. The host got upset with the umpire's call, hit him, broke his nose, and now is charged with criminal battery. The defense is voluntary intoxication, arguing that he couldn't form the intent to commit the crime because he was drunk.

First, I need to understand the legal concepts here. The key issue is whether voluntary intoxication can serve as a defense to criminal battery. I remember that in criminal law, the type of intent required for a crime affects whether intoxication can be a defense.

So, crimes can be categorized based on the level of intent required. There's specific intent, general intent, and sometimes strict liability. Specific intent crimes require the defendant to have a particular purpose in mind beyond just committing the act. For example, burglary requires the intent to commit a felony inside the building. General intent crimes just require an intent to commit the act itself, without needing a further purpose.

Voluntary intoxication is generally a defense for specific intent crimes because it can negate the specific intent required. For example, if someone is so drunk they couldn't have formed the intent to commit burglary, they might have a defense. But for general intent crimes, voluntary intoxication usually isn't a valid defense because the prosecution only needs to show that the defendant intended the act, not a further intent.

Now, the question is about criminal battery. I think battery is typically a general intent crime. Battery involves the intentional and harmful or offensive touching of another person. So the intent required is just the intent to make that contact, not any further intent beyond that.

If that's the case, then voluntary intoxication wouldn't be a valid defense because it's a general intent crime. The defense is arguing that the host lacked the mentality to form the intent, but if the crime only requires general intent, then intoxication wouldn't negate that.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's always a partial defense for any crime requiring mens rea. But that's not right because general intent doesn't allow it.

Option B says no, because it's a general intent crime and the defense isn't available. That aligns with what I was thinking.

Option E says battery is a specific intent crime, which I don't think is correct.

So the correct answer should be B. The other options don't fit as well. Options C, D, F, H, I, J are about other factors like negligence, provocation, or the situation, but the main legal issue is the type of intent required for the crime.

The defense of voluntary intoxication is not available for general intent crimes like criminal battery, which only requires intent to commit the act, not a specific further intent. 

Answer: B
