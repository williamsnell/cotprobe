Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because electromagnetism isn't my strongest subject, but I'll give it a shot. Let's read through the question again.

The problem says that a test charge q is moving with a velocity v given by (i_x + i_y) m/s. It experiences no force in a region where there's both an electric field E and a magnetic flux density B. The magnetic field B is given as (i_x - 2i_z) Wb/m². We need to find the electric field E from the given options.

Hmm, right. So I remember that when a charge is moving in electric and magnetic fields, the total force on it is given by the Lorentz force law. The formula is F = q(E + v × B). Oh wait, but wait—does the equation have a plus or minus sign? Oh right, the force is F = q(E + v × B), but wait, sometimes I get confused. No, wait, actually, the magnetic part is v cross B multiplied by q. So F = q E + q (v × B). Or is it F = q (E + v × B)? Yeah, that's right. So the total force is the sum of the electric force and the magnetic (Lorentz) force.

But in this problem, the charge experiences no force. So that means F = 0. Therefore, q(E + v × B) = 0. Since q isn't zero (because it's a test charge), the term inside the parentheses must be zero. So E + v × B = 0. Therefore, E = -v × B.

Wait, but wait a second. Oh right, I think the correct equation is F = q (E + v × B). So if F is zero, E + v × B = 0, so E = -v × B. Or wait, no, maybe I got the sign wrong. Let me think again. The Lorentz force is F = q(E + v × B), right. So if F is zero, then E + v × B = 0. So E = -v × B. Yeah, that's correct.

So I need to compute the cross product of v and B, then take the negative of that to get E.

Let me write down the vectors:

v is given as (i_x + i_y) m/s. So in vector form, v = i_x + i_y. Or wait, wait, no—actually, the problem says velocity v is (i_x + i_y) m/s, so v = (1,1,0) in components, assuming i_x, i_y, i_z are the unit vectors.

Magnetic flux density B is given as (i_x - 2i_z) Wb/m². So B = (1, 0, -2) in components.

So now, I need to compute v × B. Remember, the cross product of two vectors a = (a_x, a_y, a_z) and b = (b_x, b_y, b_z) is calculated as:

a × b = (a_y b_z - a_z b_y, a_z b_x - a_x b_z, a_x b_y - a_y b_x )

Wait, let me make sure I get the formula right. The cross product of vectors a and b is a vector whose components are:

- The x-component is a_y * b_z - a_z * b_y
- The y-component is a_z * b_x - a_x * b_z
- The z-component is a_x * b_y - a_y * b_x

So applying this to v and B.

v = (v_x, v_y, v_z) = (1, 1, 0)
B = (B_x, B_y, B_z) = (1, 0, -2)

Compute each component of v × B.

x-component: v_y * B_z - v_z * B_y = (1)(-2) - (0)(0) = -2 - 0 = -2.

y-component: v_z * B_x - v_x * B_z = (0)(1) - (1)(-2) = 0 + 2 = 2.

z-component: v_x * B_y - v_y * B_x = (1)(0) - (1)(1) = 0 -1 = -1.

So v × B = (-2, 2, -1).

Wait, wait a second. Let me double-check that. Because sometimes I mix up the order. Oh wait, the cross product is v × B, but is it v cross B or B cross v? Because cross product is anti-commutative, so v × B = - (B × v). So in our case, since the problem says v × B, that's correct as we computed.

So v × B is (-2 i_x + 2 i_y - 1 i_z). So in vector terms, (-2, 2, -1).

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the signs.

Wait, v is (1,1,0), B is (1,0,-2).

So cross product:

i component: (1)(-2) - (0)(0) = -2.

j component: (0)(1) - (1)(-2) = 0 +2 = 2. But wait, in the cross product formula, the j component is negative of (a_z b_x - a_x b_z ), wait no, wait. Let me think differently. Alternatively, the cross product can be computed using the determinant method.

The cross product is:

|i   j   k|
|1   1   0|
|1   0  -2|

So expanding this determinant:

i * (1*(-2) - 0*0) - j * (1*(-2) - 0*1) + k * (1*0 - 1*1)

Calculates to:

i*(-2 -0) - j*(-2 - 0) + k*(0 -1)

Which is:

(-2)i - (-2)j + (-1)k

So:

-2i + 2j -1k.

Which matches what I got earlier. So v × B is (-2, 2, -1).

But earlier, I thought the cross product is (a_y b_z - a_z b_y, a_z b_x - a_x b_z, a_x b_y - a_y b_x ), but using the determinant method I get the same. So that's correct.

Now, from earlier, E = - (v × B).

So E = - [ (-2, 2, -1) ] = (2, -2, 1).

So E is (2i_x - 2i_y + i_z) volts per meter.

Wait, but let me check again. Because E = - (v × B). So if v×B is (-2,2,-1), then E is (2, -2, 1).

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option D: (2i_x - 2i_y + i_z) V/m. Which is exactly what I have. So E is 2i_x -2i_y +i_z.

Wait, but let me look at the options again.

Option D: (2i_x - 2i_y + i_z) V/m. Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the order. Because in the problem statement, it's E that we're solving for, and if the calculation gives E = 2i_x -2i_y +i_z, then yes, that's option D.

But wait, let me check the options again:

Looking at the options:

A: (i_z - 2i_y) V/m — nope.

B: (-i_x + i_y) — no.

C: (3i_x - i_y - 2i_z) — no.

D: (2i_x - 2i_y +i_z) — yes, this matches.

E: (i_x - 2i_z) — no.

F: (2i_x -i_y) — no.

G: (i_x +i_y) — no.

H: (2i_x + 2i_y -i_z) — no.

I: (i_y + i_z) — no.

J: (i_x + 2i_y +i_z) — no.

So the correct option is D.

To solve the problem, we use the Lorentz force law, which states that the total force on a moving charge is given by:

\[
\mathbf{F} = q(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B})
\]

Since the charge experiences no force (\(\mathbf{F} = 0\)), it follows that:

\[
\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mathbf{E} = -(\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B})
\]

### Step 1: Define the vectors
The velocity vector is:

\[
\mathbf{v} = (1, 1, 0) \, \text{m/s}
\]

The magnetic flux density vector is:

\[
\mathbf{B} = (1, 0, -2) \, \text{Wb/m}^2
\]

### Step 2: Compute the cross product \(\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}\)
The cross product of two vectors \(\mathbf{a} = (a_x, a_y, a_z)\) and \(\mathbf{b} = (b_x, b_y, b_z)\) is given by:

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = (a_y b_z - a_z b_y, a_z b_x - a_x b_z, a_x b_y - a_y b_x)
\]

Applying this formula to \(\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}\):

- **x-component**: \(v_y B_z - v_z B_y = (1)(-2) - (0)(0) = -2\)
- **y-component**: \(v_z B_x - v_x B_z = (0)(1) - (1)(-2) = 2\)
- **z-component**: \(v_x B_y - v_y B_x = (1)(0) - (1)(1) = -1\)

Thus:

\[
\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B} = (-2, 2, -1)
\]

### Step 3: Compute \(\mathbf{E}\)
From \(\mathbf{E} = -(\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B})\), we have:

\[
\mathbf{E} = -(-2, 2, -1) = (2, -2, 1)
\]

In vector notation:

\[
\mathbf{E} = 2\mathbf{i}_x - 2\mathbf{i}_y + \mathbf{i}_z \, \text{V/m}
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
Comparing this result with the given options:

- **Option A**: \((\mathbf{i}_z - 2\mathbf{i}_y)\) — Incorrect
- **Option B**: \((- \mathbf{i}_x + \mathbf{i}_y)\) — Incorrect
- **Option C**: \((3\mathbf{i}_x - \mathbf{i}_y - 2\mathbf{i}_z)\) — Incorrect
- **Option D**: \((2\mathbf{i}_x - 2\mathbf{i}_y + \mathbf{i}_z)\) — Correct
- **Option E**: \((\mathbf{i}_x - 2\mathbf{i}_z)\) — Incorrect
- **Option F**: \((2\mathbf{i}_x - \mathbf{i}_y)\) — Incorrect
- **Option G**: \((\mathbf{i}_x + \mathbf{i}_y)\) — Incorrect
- **Option H**: \((2\mathbf{i}_x + 2\mathbf{i}_y - \mathbf{i}_z)\) — Incorrect
- **Option I**: \((\mathbf{i}_y + \mathbf{i}_z)\) — Incorrect
- **Option J**: \((\mathbf{i}_x + 2\mathbf{i}_y + \mathbf{i}_z)\) — Incorrect

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **D**.

\[
\boxed{D}
\]
