Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about strict product liability, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me start by recalling what I know about this topic.

Strict product liability is a legal doctrine that holds manufacturers, wholesalers, or retailers liable for injuries caused by their products. Unlike negligence, strict liability doesn't require proof that the defendant was negligent or at fault; instead, liability arises from the mere fact that a defective product caused injury.

The question is about a situation where Bill bought a can of Sipep from Ajax Minimart. After drinking, he found dead insects stuck inside the can. He's suing Ajax under strict product liability. The question asks what Bill must prove, among other things.

So, the elements of a strict product liability claim typically include:

1. The defendant is part of the chain of commerce (manufacturer, retailer, etc.).
2. The product was defective, which can be a manufacturing defect, design defect, or failure to warn.
3. The defect caused the plaintiff's injury.
4. The product was used in a way that was foreseeable by the defendant.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ajax failed to warn about insects. That's about failure to warn, which is one type of defect. But I'm not sure if that's the only thing he needs to prove.

Option B: Ajax had prior notice of similar problems. This might relate to negligence or knowledge, but in strict liability, prior notice isn't always necessary. The focus is on the defect, not the defendant's knowledge.

Option C: Ajax placed the insects. That implies intentional or malicious action, which isn't necessary for strict liability. It's more about whether the product was defective, not who put what there.

Option D: The insects caused physical harm. I think this is important because, without causation, there's no liability. So Bill must prove that the defect (insects) caused him harm.

Option E: Ajax is a merchant selling Sipep. This relates to being part of the chain of commerce. I remember that in strict liability, the plaintiff must show that the defendant is a commercial supplier. So this might be required.

Option F: Ajax knew or should have known of the defect. This sounds more like negligence. In strict liability, the defendant's knowledge isn't the key factor.

Option G: The can was sealed when purchased. This could indicate that the defect wasn't caused by the retailer after sale, suggesting the product was defective when it left the manufacturer. So this might be necessary to prove that the defect was present when the product was sold.

Option H: Bill consumed the entire can before noticing. Not sure. Maybe it's about whether he used the product as intended, but I don't think this is a required element for strict liability.

Option I: Ajax had a duty to inspect each can. Again, sounds like negligence. Strict liability isn't about whether they should have known, but whether the product was defective.

Option J: Ajax is the manufacturer. Wait, the question says Ajax is the minimart, so they're the retailer, not manufacturer. So this might not apply unless the manufacturer is also a defendant, but the question is about suing Ajax.

So, the key elements for strict liability that Bill must prove are:

- That the product was defective.
- That the defect caused his injury.
- That Ajax is part of the chain of commerce.

Looking back at the options, which of these are in the options.

Option E says Ajax is a merchant, which fits the chain of commerce element. So that's necessary.

Option D says the insects caused harm, which is about causation leading to injury. So that's also necessary.

Option G, the can being sealed, shows that the defect was present when sold, which ties into the manufacturing defect.

Wait, but the question is asking what Bill must prove, among other things. So it's not all the elements, just one of them.

In strict liability, the plaintiff needs to prove that the product had a defect that made it unreasonably dangerous. So, the fact that the can was sealed (Option G) might be used to show that the defect was present when the product was sold, implying it was defective when it left the manufacturer.

But another point is whether the seller (Ajax) is a merchant. Because strict liability applies to commercial sellers. So Option E could be a required element.

Wait, in the Restatement (Second) of Torts ยง402A, it states that the seller must be engaged in the business of selling such products. So yes, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant is a merchant or in the business of selling such goods.

So, looking at the options, E and G and D are possibly required.

Wait, but the question is about what Bill must prove, among other things. So the question is giving a list, and one of them is correct.

The options are A-J. Let me think again.

In a strict product liability claim, the plaintiff must show:

1. The product was defective.
2. The defect caused the injury.
3. The product was used in a way foreseeable by the manufacturer, and
4. The defendant is in the chain of commerce.

So, the options that relate to these elements.

Option E: Ajax is a merchant. That's element 4.

Option D: Insects caused harm. That's part of causation (element 2).

Option G: The can was sealed. That might relate to the product being defective as sold (element 1).

So, the question is, which of these is something Bill must prove.

In the given options, the correct answer should be E or G or D.

Wait, what's the question again? It says, "Bill must prove, among other things, that:"

Looking at the options, option E is that Ajax is a merchant selling Sipep. This is a necessary element because the doctrine applies to commercial sellers. So Bill must prove that Ajax is in the business of selling such products.

Option G, the can being sealed, tends to show that the product was in its original condition, implying that the defect was present when sold. So this might be necessary to prove the product was defective when it left the manufacturer, but maybe that's not a required element per se.

Wait, but the question is about what Bill must prove. So in the options, E is a required element, as the plaintiff must establish that the defendant is a commercial supplier.

So the correct answer would be E: Ajax is a merchant selling Sipep.

But wait, another angle: in some cases, the plaintiff doesn't need to prove that the seller is a merchant because that might be obvious from the fact that they sold the product. But the question is about what Bill must prove, so perhaps E is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the condition of the can (being sealed) is more directly relevant to showing that the defect was present at the time of sale, which is necessary to establish that the product was defective.

Wait, but the question is about strict product liability. So, if the can was sealed, it suggests that the defect was not caused by the retailer after sale, making it more likely that the manufacturer is liable. But since Bill is suing the retailer, Ajax, he needs to show that the product was defective when it left Ajax's control, which would require that the can was sealed when purchased. So Option G is also a necessary element.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. I'm trying to remember the exact elements.

I think the main elements are:

- The product was defective when it left the defendant's hands (for manufacturers) or when it was sold (for retailers).
- The defect made the product unreasonably dangerous.
- The defect caused the plaintiff's injury.
- The defendant is a commercial supplier.

So, in this case, Bill needs to show that the can was defective when he bought it, which would require showing it was sealed (Option G) to prove it wasn't tampered with after sale.

But also, that Ajax is a merchant (Option E) is necessary because that's part of the elements.

Wait, but the question asks what Bill must prove among other things. So perhaps both E and G are correct, but looking at the options, only one is correct.

Wait, the options are A to J, and the user is to choose the correct one.

Looking back, I think the key is that in strict liability, the plaintiff must prove that the product was defective at the time it left the defendant's hands. For a retailer, that's when it was sold to the consumer. So if the can was sealed when purchased (Option G), that helps establish that the defect was present at the time of sale.

Therefore, Bill must prove that the can was sealed when he bought it. So Option G is correct.

But another thought: sometimes, the retailer can still be liable even if they didn't know about the defect, as long as the product was defective when sold.

So, another necessary element is that the product was defective, which in this case is the presence of insects. But that's given in the question, so it's not an option here.

Wait, the question is about what Bill must prove. So, the options are things he needs to prove beyond the facts of the case.

So, the can being sealed (Option G) is necessary to show that the product was in the same condition as when it left the manufacturer, thus the defect was present when sold.

In that case, the correct answer would be G.

Alternatively, the fact that Ajax is a merchant (E) is necessary, but perhaps that's more of a given in the question, as Ajax is a minimart, so they are merchants.

Wait, but the question is about what must be proven. So even though it's a minimart, perhaps Bill needs to establish that Ajax is a merchant. So E would be necessary.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of an example.

In a strict liability case against a retailer, the plaintiff must show that the retailer is a merchant. Because if someone sells a product occasionally, like a private sale, strict liability doesn't apply. So in this case, Ajax is a minimart, which is a business, so E would be correct.

But then again, perhaps the fact that the can was sealed (G) is necessary to show that the product wasn't tampered with after sale, implying that the defect was present when sold.

Wait, but in some cases, the product could be defective even if it's not sealed, but in this case, the presence of the insects suggests a manufacturing defect that would have been there when the can was sealed.

I think both E and G could be correct, but the options only allow one choice.

Looking back, the question is about what Bill must prove, among other things. So it's possible that multiple options are correct, but the question expects one answer.

In the context of the bar exam, the answer would likely be E and G. But looking at the options, perhaps E is more directly an element required.

Wait, no. Let's think again. The elements are:

1. The product was defective when it left the hands of the defendant.

2. The product was defective at the time it left the manufacturer (for manufacturing defect) or the seller (for retailers).

3. The defect caused the injury.

4. The defendant is a commercial supplier.

So, in this case, Bill must prove that the can was defective when he bought it, which requires that it was sealed (Option G). Because if it wasn't sealed, perhaps the insects got in after the sale.

So perhaps G is necessary to prove that the product was defective when sold.

But then, E is also necessary because the defendant must be a merchant.

Wait, but in the question, Ajax is a minimart, so it's a business. So perhaps E is given, and the question is about another element.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is E.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the answer is E: Ajax is a merchant selling Sipep.

Wait, another approach: in a strict liability action, the plaintiff must prove that the product was defective and that the defect caused injury. But the question is about what Bill must prove among other things, so possibly the merchant status is not something the plaintiff needs to prove beyond the fact that the defendant sold the product.

Alternatively, the fact that the can was sealed (Option G) is necessary to establish that the defect was present when the product was sold, which is part of proving that the product was defective.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to recall: in cases where a product is found defective, such as a foreign object inside, the plaintiff must show that the product was defective when it left the seller's hands. To prove that, the fact that the product was sealed when purchased is important because it shows that no one tampered with it after sale. So Option G is correct.

So the answer is G.
</think>

In a strict product liability claim, the plaintiff must prove certain key elements, including that the product was defective when it left the defendant's hands, the defect caused the injury, and the defendant is part of the chain of commerce. The question asks what Bill must prove, among other things, in his strict product liability action against Ajax.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option E**: Ajax is a merchant selling Sipep. This is necessary because strict product liability applies only to commercial suppliers. However, the fact that Ajax is a minimart (a business) may make this element relatively straightforward.
  
- **Option G**: The Sipep can was sealed when Bill purchased it. This is crucial to establish that the defect (dead insects) was present when the product was sold, as it rules out tampering after the sale. This directly ties to proving the product was defective when it left Ajax's control.

While both E and G are important, the question focuses on what Bill must prove, among other things. The fact that the can was sealed (Option G) is more directly tied to proving the product was defective at the time of sale, making it the most relevant answer in this context.

ANSWER: G
