Okay, so I've got this problem here about converting the van der Waals parameter 'a' from its given units into SI base units. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on unit conversions, but let's try to think this through.

The given value is a = 0.751 atm dm^6 mol^-2. I know that atm is atmosphere and dm is decimeter. SI base units are kilograms, meters, seconds, etc. So I need to convert each part into base units.

First, let me break down each unit. The unit for 'a' is atm·dm^6·mol^-2. So I need to convert atm to Pascals (since 1 Pa is the SI unit for pressure), dm to meters, and then see how that all fits together.

Starting with the pressure unit: 1 atmosphere equals how many Pascals? I remember that 1 atm is 101325 Pascals. So I'll need to multiply 0.751 atm by 101325 Pa/atm to get Pascals.

Next, the dm^6. Since 1 dm is 0.1 meters (because 1 m = 10 dm), then 1 dm^6 is (0.1 m)^6. Let me calculate that: 0.1^6 is 1e-6. So 1 dm^6 equals 1e-6 m^6. Therefore, to convert from dm^6 to m^6, I multiply by 1e-6.

Putting it all together, the unit conversion factor would be:

a (in SI) = a (in atm dm^6/mol²) * (101325 Pa/atm) * (1e-6 m^6/dm^6)

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Oh, right, the van der Waals constant 'a' has units of pressure times volume squared per mole squared. So the unit is (pressure)*(volume/mole)^2. Or wait, no: the van der Waals equation is (P + a(n/V)^2)(V/n) = RT. So 'a' has units of Pa m^6/mol². Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of dimensional analysis.

Let me write the original unit: atm·dm^6·mol^-2.

I need to convert each part into base SI units.

1 atm = 101325 Pa (which is kg/(m·s²)) because Pascals are kg/(m s²).

1 dm is 0.1 m, so 1 dm^6 = (0.1 m)^6 = 1e-6 m^6.

So putting it all together:

1 atm·dm^6 = 101325 Pa * 1e-6 m^6 = 101325 * 1e-6 (kg/(m s²)) * m^6.

Let me compute that: 101325e-6 = 0.101325.

So 0.101325 kg/(m s²) * m^6 = 0.101325 kg m^5 / s².

So the unit becomes kg m^5 s^-2 per mol², because the original unit is per mol squared.

Wait, but the original 'a' is in atm dm^6/mol², so when converted, it's (kg m^5 s^-2) / mol².

So the entire unit for 'a' in SI is kg m^5 s^-2 mol^-2.

So the options all have kg m^5 s^-2 mol^-2 as units, so I just need to compute the numerical value.

The given value is 0.751 atm dm^6/mol².

So in SI, it's 0.751 * 101325 Pa/atm * (1 dm^6 = (0.1 m)^6 = 1e-6 m^6).

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again.

The value of a is 0.751 atm dm^6/mol².

To convert to SI:

a_SI = 0.751 atm dm^6/mol² * (101325 Pa / 1 atm) * (1 dm = 0.1 m)^6.

Wait, but dm^6 is (0.1 m)^6, so 1 dm^6 = (0.1)^6 m^6 = 1e-6 m^6.

So,

a_SI = 0.751 * 101325 * 1e-6 (Pa m^6) / mol².

But Pa is kg/(m s²), so:

a_SI = 0.751 * 101325 * 1e-6 * (kg/(m s²)) * m^6 / mol².

Simplify the expression:

= 0.751 * 101325 * 1e-6 * kg m^5 s^-2 mol^-2.

Let me compute the numerical factor.

Compute 101325 * 1e-6 first: 101325 * 1e-6 = 0.101325.

Then multiply by 0.751: 0.751 * 0.101325.

Let me calculate that:

0.751 * 0.101325 ≈ ?

Well, 0.7 * 0.1 is 0.07. 0.051 * 0.001325 is approx 0.000067. Wait, perhaps better to compute step by step.

0.751 * 0.101325.

Let me compute 0.75 * 0.101325 = 0.0759925 (since 0.75 * 0.1 is 0.075, 0.75 * 0.001325 is 0.00099375; total 0.075 + 0.00099375 = 0.07599375).

But since it's 0.751, which is 0.75 + 0.001, so 0.001 * 0.101325 = 0.000101325.

So total is 0.07599375 + 0.000101325 = 0.076095075.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 0.751 times 0.101325.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach:

0.751 * 0.101325.

Hmm, 751 * 101325 = ? Let me compute:

Wait, perhaps I can compute 751 * 101325, then adjust the decimal.

But that's getting complicated. Alternatively, approximate.

Wait, 0.751 * 0.101325 is approximately 0.0761.

Because 0.7 * 0.1 is 0.07, and the rest adds up to about 0.0061.

So approximately 0.0761.

Wait, but let me do it more accurately.

Compute 0.751 * 0.101325.

Calculate 0.751 * 101325e-6.

Wait, 0.751 * 101325 = let's compute 751 * 101325 = ?

Wait, 101325 * 0.751 = 101325 * (3/4 + 0.001/4?) No, perhaps it's easier to compute 101325 * 0.75 = 75993.75 and 101325 * 0.001 = 101.325. So total is 75993.75 + 101.325 = 76095.075. Then multiply by 1e-6: 76095.075e-6 = 0.076095075.

So approximately 0.076095, which is about 7.6095e-2.

So a_SI = 7.6095e-2 kg m^5 s^-2 mol^-2.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option I is 7.61e-2, which matches. Option C is 8.51e-2, which is higher. Option J is 6.71e-2, which is lower.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, another approach: 1 atm = 101325 Pa, and 1 dm^3 is 1 liter, but that's volume. But in this case, we have dm^6. So 1 dm^6 = (0.1 m)^6 = 1e-6 m^6.

So the conversion factor is (1 atm) * (1 dm^6) = 101325 Pa * 1e-6 m^6 = 0.101325 Pa m^6.

But wait, Pa is kg/(m s²), so Pa m^6 = kg m^5 s^-2.

So, 0.101325 kg m^5 s^-2.

Then, a is 0.751 atm dm^6/mol², so a_SI = 0.751 * 0.101325 kg m^5 s^-2/mol².

So 0.751 * 0.101325 = ?

Let me compute 0.75 * 0.101325 = 0.07599375. Then 0.001 * 0.101325 = 0.000101325. Adding together gives 0.076095075.

So a_SI ≈ 0.076095 kg m^5 s^-2/mol².

Which is 7.6095e-2 kg m^5 s^-2 mol^-2.

Looking at the options:

Option I is 7.61e-2, which matches.

So the correct answer should be option I.

To convert the van der Waals parameter \( a = 0.751 \, \mathrm{atm} \, \mathrm{dm}^6 \, \mathrm{mol}^{-2} \) into SI base units, we proceed as follows:

1. **Convert pressure from atm to Pa**:  
   \( 1 \, \mathrm{atm} = 101325 \, \mathrm{Pa} \), so:  
   \[
   0.751 \, \mathrm{atm} = 0.751 \times 101325 \, \mathrm{Pa} = 76195.075 \, \mathrm{Pa}.
   \]

2. **Convert volume from \(\mathrm{dm}^6\) to \(\mathrm{m}^6\)**:  
   \( 1 \, \mathrm{dm} = 0.1 \, \mathrm{m} \), so \( 1 \, \mathrm{dm}^6 = (0.1)^6 \, \mathrm{m}^6 = 1 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{m}^6 \).  
   Therefore:  
   \[
   0.751 \, \mathrm{dm}^6 = 0.751 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{m}^6 = 7.51 \times 10^{-7} \, \mathrm{m}^6.
   \]

3. **Combine the units**:  
   The unit of \( a \) in SI is \( \mathrm{kg} \, \mathrm{m}^5 \, \mathrm{s}^{-2} \, \mathrm{mol}^{-2} \). To compute the numerical value:  
   \[
   a_{\text{SI}} = 0.751 \times 101325 \times 10^{-6} = 0.076095 \, \mathrm{kg} \, \mathrm{m}^5 \, \mathrm{s}^{-2} \, \mathrm{mol}^{-2}.
   \]

4. **Match the result to the closest option**:  
   The calculated value \( 0.076095 \, \mathrm{kg} \, \mathrm{m}^5 \, \mathrm{s}^{-2} \, \mathrm{mol}^{-2} \) is approximately \( 7.61 \times 10^{-2} \, \mathrm{kg} \, \mathrm{m}^5 \, \mathrm{s}^{-2} \, \mathrm{mol}^{-2} \), which corresponds to **Option I**.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**I**
