Question:

An athlete hoped to sign a contract with a professional baseball team to play baseball. He had succeeded in arranging for a tryout at the baseball team's training facilities in a neighboring state. Short on funds and needing a way to get to the training facilities, the athlete approached his friend and said, "If you will drive me to and from the baseball team's training facilities for my tryout and pay for our housing and meal expenses during our stay, I will assign to you 10 percent of my first-year earnings. " The friend agreed and drove the athlete to the training facilities. After the tryout, the baseball team offered the athlete a contract to play baseball for the team at $100,000 per year. When the friend asked when he would be receiving his 10 percent, the athlete replied that $10,000 was much more than the friend deserved and he would pay the friend $1,000 for his efforts. The friend then filed suit to enforce the assignment. If the court holds the assignment unenforceable, the most applicable legal principle would be

Options:

A: the assignment was not in writing, therefore it is not enforceable.
B: a purported assignment of a right expected to arise under a contract not in existence operates only as a promise to assign the right when it arises and as a power to enforce it.
C: the assignment was not fair and reasonable, therefore it can be revoked.
D: the athlete was under duress when making the assignment, rendering it unenforceable.
E: the assignment is unenforceable because the athlete's contract with the baseball team prohibited any assignment of earnings.
F: the friend did not provide a valuable consideration in return for the assignment.
G: an assignment of a right expected to arise from a future event is enforceable once the event occurs.
H: a contract to make a future assignment of a right is not a validly enforceable assignment.
I: the friend did not detrimentally rely on the assignment prior to the attempted revocation of the assignment by the athlete.
J: a gratuitous assignment is revocable, and the right of the assignee is terminated by the assignor's subsequent revocation.

Okay, so I've got this question about contract law, specifically dealing with assignments. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is an athlete who wants to try out for a baseball team but doesn't have enough money. So he asks his friend for help. The friend agrees to drive him to and from the training facilities and cover their housing and meal expenses. In return, the athlete promises to assign 10% of his first-year earnings to the friend. 

Then, the athlete gets a $100k contract, so 10% would be $10k. But when the friend asks for it, the athlete only offers $1k, claiming $10k is too much. The friend sues to enforce the assignment, and the question is why the court might find the assignment unenforceable.

The options are A through J, each presenting a different legal principle. I'll need to figure out which one applies here.

First, I remember that assignments of future rights can be tricky. An assignment is when someone transfers a right they have under a contract to someone else. But when the right hasn't come into existence yet, like if the contract isn't even made yet, the rules are different.

So in this case, the athlete didn't have a contract with the team when he made the assignment. He was just hoping to get one after the tryout. So he was assigning a future right.

I think there's a rule that when you assign a right that is expected to arise under a future contract, it's not automatically enforceable. Instead, it's treated as a promise to assign once the right comes into being. But to make it enforceable, certain conditions must be met, like consideration or something in writing maybe.

Wait, consideration is important in contracts. Did the friend provide consideration? He drove the athlete and paid for expenses. That sounds like consideration because it's a bargained-for exchange. So option F, which says there was no valuable consideration, might not be the right choice because the friend did provide something.

Option A says the assignment wasn't in writing. I recall that some assignments require a writing under the Statute of Frauds. But I'm not sure if that applies here. The Statute of Frauds typically applies to assignments involving land, goods, or certain other contracts. Maybe not for personal services or earnings. So maybe A isn't the best answer.

Option B says that a purported assignment of a right expected to arise under a contract not yet in existence operates only as a promise to assign once it arises. That sounds familiar. So the assignment here would be treated as a promise, not an immediate transfer. But then, when the contract is made, the assignor (the athlete) has to assign the right. However, I think that without consideration beyond the initial agreement, such a promise might not be enforceable unless it's supported by new consideration when the right arises.

Wait, but the original agreement was supported by considerationâ€”the friend's services. So maybe the initial promise is binding. Hmm, this is confusing. Let me think again.

Another point is that an assignment of future rights can sometimes be revocable. If the assignment was revocable, the athlete could take it back. But I think that once the right vests, the assignment becomes enforceable, provided it was made with consideration.

Wait, no, I'm mixing things up. The general rule is that a contract to assign future rights is revocable unless there's consideration for the promise to assign. So in this case, the friend provided consideration (driving, paying expenses), so the promise to assign becomes binding, right?

Wait, but some sources say that an assignment of a future right is only a promise to assign and isn't enforceable until the right exists. So even if consideration exists, the assignee can't enforce it until the right arises. But once the right exists, the assignor must assign it. Alternatively, maybe the assignment is treated as a present assignment of a future right, which requires consideration to be enforceable.

Wait, but in this scenario, the assignment was made before the athlete had any rights because the contract wasn't signed yet. So the assignment would be of a future right, and under common law, such an assignment is revocable unless there's consideration beyond the mutual promises.

Wait, no, the consideration here was the friend's driving and expenses. So the original agreement was supported by consideration, making the assignment binding once the right arose. So why would the court find it unenforceable?

Alternatively, maybe because the assignment was of a future right and was not in writing. Or perhaps the court would apply the rule that such an assignment is a mere promise, not an enforceable assignment.

Wait, option B says that the assignment of a right expected to arise under a contract not in existence operates only as a promise to assign. So if the court holds it unenforceable, perhaps it's because it was a promise, not an assignment. But I'm a bit confused because the consideration was present. 

Alternatively, maybe the issue is that an assignment of a future right is revocable unless it's supported by consideration beyond the initial promise. But the friend did provide consideration, so maybe it's not the reason.

Wait, another angle: the initial assignment was of 10%, but when the athlete got the contract, he offered only $1k. The friend is suing to get the 10%. But maybe the court says that the assignment was a promise to assign 10%, but since the right didn't exist at the time of the promise, the assignment isn't enforceable unless it's in writing or unless certain conditions are met.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me try to outline the possibilities.

1. The assignment was of a future right (since the contract wasn't made yet). So under common law, such an assignment is revocable unless in writing and there's consideration.

2. The consideration here was the friend's services, so perhaps the assignment is enforceable. But then why would the court find it unenforceable?

Wait, the options are about why the court holds it unenforceable. So we have to pick which reason.

Option B says it's only a promise to assign. So even if the consideration exists, the assignment isn't effective until the right arises, but even then, the assignor can revoke it unless there's new consideration.

Wait, no, I think when the right arises, the assignment becomes effective, but if the assignment was made without consideration, it's revocable. But in this case, there was consideration.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the assignment was a promise to assign, not an immediate transfer. So when the athlete got the contract, he had the right to assign, but the friend had to demand it. But if the athlete doesn't assign, the friend can sue for breach of the promise, not to enforce the assignment. Or maybe it's treated as an option, requiring consideration to keep it open.

Alternatively, I'm mixing up different aspects. Let me think about the options again.

Option B: This seems to relate to the concept that an assignment of a future right is only a promise to assign once the right arises. So the friend can't enforce the assignment until the athlete actually gets the contract. But in this case, he did get the contract, so maybe the assignment should be enforceable. Unless the assignment is revocable even after the right arises.

Option J says that a gratuitous assignment is revocable. But this assignment wasn't gratuitous because the friend provided consideration. So J might not apply.

Option H says a contract to make a future assignment isn't enforceable. But if the contract was supported by consideration, maybe it is enforceable. So H might be incorrect.

Option I talks about detrimental reliance. If the friend didn't rely, maybe the assignment can be revoked. But the friend did drive and spend money, so there was reliance. So I might not be the reason.

Option F says no consideration. But the friend did provide consideration, so F is out.

Option A is about writing. If the assignment wasn't in writing, perhaps under the Statute of Frauds, it's unenforceable. But I'm not sure if earnings fall under the Statute of Frauds. Typically, assignments of personal property don't require a writing unless it's for a term of years or something. So maybe A doesn't apply.

Option E suggests the contract prohibits assignment, but nothing in the question says that, so E is out.

Option D is about duress. There's no indication the athlete was coerced, so D is unlikely.

Option C says it's not fair and reasonable. But the question is about enforceability, not fairness. So C might not be the reason.

Option G says assignments of future rights are enforceable once the event occurs. But the question is why it's unenforceable, so G is the opposite.

So, looking back, the most applicable principle seems to be option B: a purported assignment of a right expected to arise under a contract not in existence operates only as a promise to assign and as a power to enforce it.

Wait, but if the assignment is only a promise, does that mean it's not enforceable as an assignment? So the friend might have to sue for breach of contract, not to enforce the assignment. Or maybe the assignment isn't automatically effective upon the right arising.

Alternatively, maybe the assignment is revocable because it's a future right. But I thought that with consideration, it becomes binding once the right arises.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to recall: Under common law, an assignment of a future right is revocable unless it's made for consideration. Wait, no, consideration makes it binding. So the assignment would be enforceable once the right arises. So why would the court hold it unenforceable?

Wait, maybe because the assignment was of a right to a percentage of earnings, which is a type of property that doesn't exist until the contract is made. So the assignment is only a promise to assign, not an immediate transfer, making it unenforceable unless it's in writing or there's new consideration.

Wait, but the consideration was present when the promise was made. So perhaps the assignment is enforceable, but the court is applying the rule that such assignments are only promises, not actual assignments, so the friend can't enforce it as an assignment but might have a breach of contract claim.

Alternatively, maybe the court is using the rule that an assignment of a future right is revocable unless it's made in writing. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B because the assignment was of a right that didn't exist yet, so it's only a promise, not an assignment. Therefore, when the friend tried to enforce it, the court says it's unenforceable as an assignment because it was just a promise.

So the answer would be B.

The question revolves around the enforceability of an assignment of future earnings in a contract law context. The athlete promised to assign 10% of his first-year earnings to his friend in exchange for transportation and expenses related to a tryout. When the athlete later refused to pay the agreed-upon 10%, the friend sued to enforce the assignment. The issue is determining why the court might hold the assignment unenforceable.

Key analysis of the options:

- **Option A**: The assignment was not in writing. While the Statute of Frauds requires certain assignments to be in writing, this typically applies to specific types of contracts (e.g., land, goods). Assignments of personal property like earnings generally do not require a writing, so this is unlikely to be the reason.

- **Option B**: A purported assignment of a right expected to arise under a contract not in existence operates only as a promise to assign the right when it arises. This aligns with the common law principle that an assignment of a future right is treated as a promise to assign rather than an immediate transfer. At the time of the agreement, the athlete had no contract with the baseball team, so the right being assigned did not yet exist. This makes the assignment unenforceable as a present assignment.

- **Option C**: The assignment was not fair and reasonable. While the athlete argued that $10,000 was excessive, the enforceability of the assignment is not based on fairness but on legal principles. This option does not address the core issue.

- **Option D**: The athlete was under duress. There is no evidence in the scenario to suggest that the athlete was coerced into making the assignment, so this is not applicable.

- **Option E**: The athlete's contract with the baseball team prohibited assignment. The question does not mention any such prohibition, so this option is irrelevant.

- **Option F**: The friend did not provide valuable consideration. This is incorrect because the friend provided transportation and covered expenses, which constitutes valid consideration.

- **Option G**: An assignment of a right expected to arise from a future event is enforceable once the event occurs. This is the opposite of what the question asks, as it assumes enforceability, which is not the case here.

- **Option H**: A contract to make a future assignment of a right is not a validly enforceable assignment. While this is similar to Option B, it is less precise. The key issue is that the assignment was of a future right, not that it was a contract to make a future assignment.

- **Option I**: The friend did not detrimentally rely on the assignment. This is incorrect because the friend did rely by providing transportation and expenses, which constitutes detrimental reliance.

- **Option J**: A gratuitous assignment is revocable. This does not apply because the assignment was not gratuitous; the friend provided consideration.

The most applicable legal principle is that an assignment of a right expected to arise under a contract not yet in existence operates only as a promise to assign the right when it arises. Since the athlete had no contract at the time of the agreement, the assignment was not enforceable as a present transfer of rights.
