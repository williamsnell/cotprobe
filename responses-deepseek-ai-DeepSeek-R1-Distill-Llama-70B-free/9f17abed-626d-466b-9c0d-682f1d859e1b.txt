Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy levels of sodium. Hmm, I remember that sodium has this "D" line which is part of its principal series. The question says the D line is at 5890 Angstroms, and it's a transition from the first excited state (3p) to the ground state (3s). I need to find the energy of the first excited state in electron volts (eV).

Wait, wait. So the principal series involves transitions to the ground state, right? Like, electrons dropping from higher orbitals to the ground state. Sodium's ground state is 3s, so the first excited state would be 3p. So when an electron transitions from 3p to 3s, it emits a photon with a specific wavelength.

The given wavelength is 5890 Angstroms. I think I need to use the Rydberg formula or maybe the relationship between energy and wavelength. Oh right, the energy of the photon emitted is the difference between the energy levels of the two states. So E_photon = E_excited - E_ground.

Wait, but wait, the problem is asking for the energy of the excited state, not the ground state. Hmm. Wait, no, no, I think the energy of the excited state is higher than the ground state. So when the electron transitions down, it emits a photon. So the energy of the excited state minus the ground state's energy is the photon's energy.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. The ground state is lower in energy than the excited state. So the energy difference is E_excited - E_ground. So the photon emitted will have energy equal to that difference.

So first, I need to calculate the energy of the photon. The wavelength given is 5890 Angstroms, which is 5890 x 10^-10 meters. Because 1 Angstrom is 1e-10 meters.

I remember the formula E = hc/lambda, where h is Planck's constant and c the speed of light. So I need to plug in the numbers.

Wait, let me get the constants right. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. The speed of light c is about 3.0 x 10^8 m/s.

But wait, since the wavelength is in Angstroms, maybe I should convert it to meters first.

So lambda = 5890 A = 5890 x 10^-10 m = 5.89 x 10^-7 meters? Wait, no. 1 A is 1e-10 m, so 5890 A is 5890e-10 m. Let me compute that: 5890e-10 = 5.89e-7 meters.

Wait, no. 5890 A is 5890 * 1e-10 m = 5.890e-7 m.

So putting into E = hc/lambda.

E_photon = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3.0e8 m/s) / (5.89e-7 m)

Let me calculate that. Let me compute numerator first: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = (6.626 * 3) = 19.878, so 19.878e-26 J·m.

Divide by 5.89e-7 m: 19.878e-26 / 5.89e-7 = (19.878 / 5.89) )e-19.

19.878 divided by approx 5.89 is around 3.375, because 5.89 *3 is 17.67, and 5.89 *3.37 is about 19.85. So around 3.375e-19 J.

But wait, since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so to convert from J to eV, we divide by 1.602e-19.

So E_photon (eV) = (3.375e-19 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 3.375 / 1.602 ≈ approx 2.105 eV.

Wait, that gives me about 2.105 eV. So that's the energy of the photon emitted when the electron transitions from 3p to 3s.

But wait, the question is asking for the energy of the first excited state (3p). So how does that relate to the ground state?

I think the ground state is 3s, and its energy is lower than 3p. So the energy difference between 3p and 3s is the photon energy, which we just calculated as about 2.105 eV.

But wait, no, the energy levels are usually given relative to the ground state. So E_ground is the energy of 3s, and E_excited is the energy of 3p. So E_excited = E_ground + E_photon?

Wait, no, because when an electron transitions from a higher energy state to a lower one, it emits a photon with energy equal to the difference. So E_excited = E_ground + E_photon.

Wait, that can't be right. Because E_excited is higher than E_ground. So when the electron drops, it releases energy. So E_photon = E_excited - E_ground.

So the energy of the excited state is E_ground plus the photon's energy.

But wait, if the ground state's energy is E_ground, then the excited state is E_ground + E_photon.

But wait, the ground state energy for sodium's 3s orbital is a specific value. Wait, but how are we to find the absolute energy of the excited state?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Oh wait, the question might assume that the ground state (3s) is at 0 eV, and the excited state (3p) is at E = E_photon. But that doesn't make sense because the photon's energy is the difference between the two states. So if the ground state is at 0, then the excited state would have energy E_photon.

Wait, but that can't be right because in reality, the ground state is at a certain negative energy. For example, the hydrogen ground state is -13.6 eV, but sodium's would be different.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the principal series, and the energy levels are based on the Rydberg formula. Wait, sodium has a more complex structure than hydrogen, but perhaps the problem is simplified.

Wait, the Rydberg formula is 1/lambda = R*(1/(n1^2) - 1/(n2^2)), where n1 < n2. But in the principal series, n1 is the ground state, which is the lower energy level.

Wait, principal series for sodium would have transitions ending at n=3 (since ground state is 3s). So for the D line, the transition is from 3p (n=3, l=1) to 3s (n=3, l=0). Wait, that can't be right because 3p is higher than 3s, so the transition would be 3p →3s, which would emit a photon.

Wait, but sodium's energy levels are filled such that 3s is filled, and 3p is the next higher orbital. So the first excited state is 3p.

So in the Rydberg formula, the transition would be from higher n to lower n. Wait, but in the principal series, the transitions are to the ground state, so n_final =3, and n_initial varies (like 4,5,6...).

Wait, no, no. The principal series is when the final state is the ground state, so transitions like 3p → 3s, but wait, 3s is the ground state, so for the principal series, the initial state must be higher than 3. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question says the transition is from 3p to 3s, which would be within the same principal quantum number (n=3). But transitions within the same n usually aren't part of the principal series. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. The energy difference between 3p and 3s is what I calculated earlier, about 2.1 eV. So the question is asking what is the energy of the first excited state (3p). Wait, but relative to what? If the ground state is 0 eV, then the excited state would be 2.1 eV. But that's not correct because the actual energy levels are negative.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The question states that the transition is from 3p to 3s, emitting a photon of wavelength 5890A. So the energy of the photon is E_photon = hc/lambda.

I calculated that E_photon ≈ 2.105 eV. So the energy difference between 3p and 3s is 2.105 eV. So if the ground state (3s) is at some energy E_ground, then 3p is at E_ground + 2.105 eV.

But the question is asking for the energy of the first excited state (3p) in eV. But without knowing E_ground, how can I find the absolute energy?

Wait, perhaps the question is assuming that the ground state is at 0 eV, which isn't the case in reality, but maybe that's the assumption here. Because in that case, the excited state would be at 2.105 eV.

Looking at the options, option A is 2.105 eV. So that would be the answer.

But wait, in reality, the ground state of sodium is much lower than that. Sodium's first ionization energy is around 5.1 eV, so the 3s state would be at -5.1 eV or something like that. But the question might not be considering that and is asking for the energy difference.

Wait, the question specifically says, "the energy of the first excited state." So perhaps it's the energy difference, not the absolute value. But the options are presented as eV without a sign, implying it's the magnitude of the energy difference.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is mistakenly referring to the energy of the photon as the energy of the excited state, which isn't correct. Because the excited state's energy is higher than the ground state by the photon's energy.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check my calculations.

Let me recalculate E_photon.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3.0e8 m/s

lambda = 5890 A = 5890e-10 m = 5.89e-7 m.

E_photon = hc/lambda = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / 5.89e-7

Calculate numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 5.89e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 /5.89e-7 = approx 3.375e-19 J.

Convert to eV: 3.375e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.105 eV.

So that's correct.

So the energy difference is 2.105 eV. So the excited state is 2.105 eV above the ground state. So if the question is asking for the energy of the excited state relative to the ground state, the answer is 2.105 eV.

Looking at the options, option A is 2.105 eV, which would be the correct choice.

To determine the energy of the first excited state (3p) of sodium, we analyze the transition from the 3p state to the 3s ground state, which emits a photon corresponding to the "D" line at a wavelength of 5890 Å. The energy of the photon is calculated using the formula:

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

Where:
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) (Planck's constant),
- \( c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light),
- \( \lambda = 5890 \, \text{Å} = 5890 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} = 5.89 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \).

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
h \cdot c = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (3.0 \times 10^8) = 1.9878 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J·m}.
\]

Next, divide by the wavelength:

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{5.89 \times 10^{-7}} = 3.375 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

Convert this energy to electron volts (eV) using the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \):

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{3.375 \times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.105 \, \text{eV}.
\]

This energy represents the difference between the 3p (first excited state) and the 3s (ground state). Since the question asks for the energy of the first excited state, and assuming the ground state energy is taken as reference (e.g., 0 eV), the energy of the first excited state is approximately \( 2.105 \, \text{eV} \).

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**A: 2.105 eV**
