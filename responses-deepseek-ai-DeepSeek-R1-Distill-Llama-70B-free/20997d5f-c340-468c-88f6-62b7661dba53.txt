Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the variance of a random variable X that's uniformly distributed over the interval [0, 3]. Hmm, right, uniform distribution. I remember that the uniform distribution has a constant probability density function over a certain interval, which in this case is from 0 to 3.

Wait, variance, right. Variance measures how much the values of a random variable differ from its mean. For a uniform distribution, I think the variance has a specific formula. Let me try to recall. Oh yeah, I think the formula for the variance of a uniform distribution over [a, b] is (b - a)^2 divided by 12. So Var(X) = (b - a)^2 / 12.

In this problem, a is 0 and b is 3. So substituting those values in, the variance should be (3 - 0)^2 / 12. That's 9 divided by 12, which simplifies to 3/4. Wait, 9/12 is 3/4 when reduced. So the variance is 3/4.

Let me double-check that. The mean of a uniform distribution is (a + b)/2. So here, the mean is (0 + 3)/2 = 1.5. Then the variance is E[X^2] - (E[X])^2. Oh right, another way to compute variance is by finding the expected value of X squared minus the square of the expected value.

I think for a uniform distribution, E[X^2] is (b^3 - a^3)/(3(b - a))... Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The expected value of X squared for a uniform distribution on [a, b] is the integral from a to b of x^2 * (1/(b - a)) dx.

So the integral of x^2 dx is (x^3)/3. Evaluating from 0 to 3, it would be (27/3 - 0) = 9. Multiply by 1/(3 - 0) which is 1/3. So E[X^2] = 9 * (1/3) = 3.

Wait, wait, that can't be right because if E[X^2] is 3, and (E[X])^2 is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the variance would be 3 - 2.25 = 0.75, which is 3/4. Oh yeah, same as before. So that's consistent.

Alternatively, using the formula I mentioned earlier, Var(X) = (3)^2 / 12 = 9/12 = 3/4. So either way, I get the same result.

Looking back at the options, option C is (3/4), so that should be the correct answer. Let me see the options again to make sure I'm not mixing up letters. The options are A: 1/3, B:9/4, C:3/4, D:3/2, etc. So yes, option C is correct.

The variance of a random variable \( X \) uniformly distributed over the interval \([0, 3]\) can be calculated using the formula for the variance of a uniform distribution: 

\[
\text{Var}(X) = \frac{(b - a)^2}{12},
\]

where \( a = 0 \) and \( b = 3 \). Substituting these values:

\[
\text{Var}(X) = \frac{(3 - 0)^2}{12} = \frac{9}{12} = \frac{3}{4}.
\]

This result can also be verified by computing \( E[X^2] \) and \( (E[X])^2 \). For a uniform distribution, \( E[X] = \frac{a + b}{2} = \frac{0 + 3}{2} = 1.5 \), and \( E[X^2] \) is calculated as:

\[
E[X^2] = \int_0^3 x^2 \cdot \frac{1}{3} \, dx = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \left[ \frac{x^3}{3} \right]_0^3 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{27}{3} = 3.
\]

Thus, the variance is:

\[
\text{Var}(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2 = 3 - (1.5)^2 = 3 - 2.25 = 0.75 = \frac{3}{4}.
\]

Both methods confirm that the variance is \( \frac{3}{4} \). Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**C: \( \frac{3}{4} \).**
