Question:

In humans, the disease known as hemophilia is inherited as an X-linked recessive trait. Sally and Sam, both of whom are normal, marry, and they have three children: (1) Saul, a hemophiliac, who marries a normal woman and has a daughter, Sarah, who is normal; (2) a normal daughter, Sheryl, who marries a normal man and has a son, Solomon, who is a hemophiliac; and (3) Shirley, also normal, who marries and has six normal sons. Using the letters H and h for the normal and hemophilia genes, respectively, and \nearrow to represent the Y chromosome, determine the genotypes of Sally, Sam, Saul, Sarah, Sheryl, Solomon and Shirley.

Options:

A: Sally: HH, Sam: h\nearrow, Saul: h\nearrow, Sarah: HH, Sheryl: Hh, Solomon: H\nearrow, Shirley: Hh
B: Sally: HH, Sam: H\nearrow, Saul: h\nearrow, Sarah: HH, Sheryl: Hh, Solomon: H\nearrow, Shirley: HH
C: Sally: Hh, Sam: H\nearrow, Saul: h\nearrow, Sarah: Hh, Sheryl: HH, Solomon: h\nearrow, Shirley: Hh
D: Sally: Hh, Sam: H\nearrow, Saul: h\nearrow, Sarah: Hh, Sheryl: Hh, Solomon: h\nearrow, Shirley: HH
E: Sally: HH, Sam: H\nearrow, Saul: Hh, Sarah: HH, Sheryl: Hh, Solomon: h\nearrow, Shirley: Hh
F: Sally: Hh, Sam: H\nearrow, Saul: h\nearrow, Sarah: HH, Sheryl: Hh, Solomon: H\nearrow, Shirley: Hh
G: Sally: Hh, Sam: H\nearrow, Saul: h\nearrow, Sarah: Hh, Sheryl: HH, Solomon: H\nearrow, Shirley: Hh
H: Sally: HH, Sam: H\nearrow, Saul: h\nearrow, Sarah: Hh, Sheryl: HH, Solomon: h\nearrow, Shirley: Hh
I: Sally: Hh, Sam: H\nearrow, Saul: H\nearrow, Sarah: HH, Sheryl: Hh, Solomon: h\nearrow, Shirley: HH
J: Sally: Hh, Sam: h\nearrow, Saul: H\nearrow, Sarah: Hh, Sheryl: HH, Solomon: h\nearrow, Shirley: Hh

Okay, so I have this genetics problem here about hemophilia, which is an X-linked recessive trait. Hmm, I remember that X-linked means the gene is on the X chromosome. Recessive so you need two copies to show the trait, but for males, they only have one X, so it's easier for them to have the disease.

The question is about Sally and Sam who are both normal, but they have three children, some of whom have hemophilia or have kids with it. I need to figure out the genotypes for each of them using H for normal and h for hemophilic.

Let me think through each family member step by step.

First, Sally and Sam are both phenotypically normal. But Sally could be HH or Hh, and since the disease is X-linked, Sam's genotype would be H Y because he's male and normal. Wait, wait. Wait, no, because if the father is normal, he can't pass an X with h to his sons, because sons get the Y from him. So Sam's X must be H.

Wait, no. Wait, Sam has an X and a Y. Since he's normal, his X must be H. So Sam is H Y. Because if he were h Y, he would have hemophilia, but he's normal.

Sally is normal, so her genotype could be either HH or Hh. Because if she were hh, she'd have hemophilia, which she doesn't. So Sally is either HH or Hh.

Now their children: three kids. The first is Saul, who has hemophilia. Then a normal daughter Sheryl, and another normal daughter Shirley.

Wait, wait, no, the children are: (1) Saul, hemophiliac; (2) Sheryl, normal daughter; (3) Shirley, normal.

Wait, but in the description, Sally and Sam have three children: Saul (son, hemophiliac), Sheryl (daughter, normal), and Shirley (daughter, normal). 

Wait, no, wait: the original question says that Sally and Sam have three children: (1) Saul, a hemophiliac; (2) a normal daughter, Sheryl; and (3) Shirley, also normal. So two daughters and one son.

Wait, but how does that work with the X-linked disease? Let me think.

So, Sally's genotype: Let's see. Since their son Saul has hemophilia, which is X-linked recessive. Sons get their X from their mother and Y from the father.

So, for a son to have hemophilia (h), he must get the Xh from the mother. Since Sam can only contribute a Y (as he's normal, so his X is H), the Xh must come from Sally. So Sally must have at least one h allele.

So Sally's genotype must be Hh. Because if she were HH, she couldn't pass an h to her son. Because she has to pass one of her X's. So Sally is Hh.

So Sally: Hh.

Sam is normal, so his genotype must be H Y. Because he can't have the h on his X, otherwise he'd have hemophilia.

So Sam: H Y.

Now, their son Saul has hemophilia, so he must have the h allele on his X. So he received Xh from Sally and Y from Sam. So Saul's genotype is Xh Y. But in the notation, I think the Y is written as \nearrow, so his genotype would be h\nearrow.

Wait, but wait, the options use H and h with the chromosomes. So for males, it's H\nearrow or h\nearrow.

So Saul is h\nearrow.

Now, Saul marries a normal woman. Let's think about her genotype. Since she's normal, she can't have two h alleles. So she's either HH or Hh. But in the options, Sarah is their daughter, who is normal, so we'll get to that later.

Now, their daughter Sheryl is normal. So what's her genotype? She gets her X from Sally and X from Sam. Wait, Sally is Hh, so she can give H or h. Sam gives his X, which is H. So Sheryl would get either H from Sally and H from Sam, making her HH, or h from Sally and H from Sam, making her Hh.

But Sheryl is phenotypically normal, which she is whether she's HH or Hh. So Sheryl could be either. But let's look at her children. Sheryl marries a normal man and has a son, Solomon, who is a hemophiliac.

Wait, Sheryl's son has hemophilia. So how is that possible? Because sons get their X from their mother and Y from father.

So Solomon's X must have the h allele. Which means Sheryl must have given him an Xh. So Sheryl must carry at least one h allele. Because if she were HH, she could only pass H. But she's passing h. So Sheryl's genotype must be Hh.

Wait, because Sheryl is Hh, she can pass either H or h to her son. Since her son has h, she must have passed h, so the father must have a normal X as well. Wait, the father is normal, so his genotype is H Y. So he can only give Y to the son, and X must come from Sheryl.

So Sheryl is Hh.

Now, Sheryl has a son, Solomon, who is hemophiliac. So his genotype is h\nearrow.

Wait, let me confirm: Sheryl is Hh, so she can pass Xh to her son. Since the son has hemophilia, his X is h, so genotype is h\nearrow.

Now, what about Shirley? She's Sally and Sam's third child, a normal daughter. So her genotype could be HH or Hh.

Shirley marries and has six normal sons. All her sons are normal. Let's think about their genotypes. Sons get Y from father and X from mother.

So for all six sons to be normal, they must have received an X with H from Shirley. So Shirley must have given them H. But wait, if Shirley is Hh, each son has a 50% chance of getting H or h. But all six sons are normal, which would be a very low probability if she's Hh (each has 1/2 chance, so (1/2)^6 is 1/64 chance). But if she's HH, all sons would definitely get H.

But since she's a daughter of Sally (Hh) and Sam (H Y), what's the probability? Let's think.

Shirley gets X from Sally and X from Sam. Sally is Hh, so can pass H or h. Sam can only pass H. So Shirley's possible genotypes are:

If she got H from Sally, then she's HH.
If she got h from Sally, then she's Hh.

So there's a 50% chance she's HH and 50% Hh.

But she has six sons, all normal. If she were Hh, the chance is (1/2)^6 = 1/64. That's possible but unlikely. Alternatively, if she's HH, all sons are definitely normal.

But the question doesn't state that it's unlikely, so perhaps she must be HH.

Wait, but let's think. If Shirley is Hh, she could have sons with hemophilia, but in this case, she doesn't. So in this scenario, she's had six sons, all normal. So the only way to guarantee that is if she's HH. Because if she were Hh, each son would have a 50% chance of getting h, leading to some with hemophilia. Since none have it, she must be HH.

Therefore, Shirley is HH.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. The problem doesn't say that all her sons are definitely normal, but in this case, they are. So from the given information, she must be HH. Because if she were Hh, it's possible but not certain.

Alternatively, the problem expects us to deduce based on the information given. Since all her sons are normal, the only way that can happen is if she is HH. Because if she were Hh, each son would have a 50% chance, but given that all six are normal, it's more likely that she is HH.

So Shirley: HH.

Wait, but let me check the options. Looking at the options, some have Shirley as HH and others as Hh.

Now, let's summarize what we have so far:

Sally: Hh (since she must pass h to Saul)
Sam: H\nearrow (H Y)
Saul: h\nearrow (because he has hemophilia)
Sarah: Let's see, Sarah is Saul's daughter, and she's normal. So Sarah's genotype.

Saul is h\nearrow (Xh Y). He marries a normal woman. Let's find her genotype.

The normal woman could be HH or Hh. Let's say she's HH or Hh.

Sarah is their daughter. She must receive an X from each parent. From Saul, she gets Xh (since he only has Xh to give), and from her mother, she gets X (either H or h). But Sarah is normal, so she can't have two h alleles. So her genotype would be Xh from father and X (from mother). So if the mother is HH, Sarah would be Hh (XH from mother and Xh from father). If the mother is Hh, Sarah could be Hh (XH) or hh (Xh from both). But Sarah is normal, so she can't be hh. So the mother must be at least Hh? Wait, no. If mother is Hh, there's a 50% chance she gives H and 50% h. So for Sarah to be normal, she must have gotten H from mother. So Sarah would be Hh.

Wait, but if the mother is Hh, Sarah could be Hh or hh. But since Sarah is normal, she must have at least one H. So the mother must be either HH or Hh, but if the mother is Hh, it's possible Sarah got Xh from father and Xh from mother, making her hh, which is hemophilic. But Sarah is normal, so that can't happen. Therefore, the mother must be HH. Because if the mother is HH, she can only give H to Sarah. So Sarah's genotype is XH (from mother) and Xh (from father), making her Hh. But Sarah is phenotypically normal because she has one H.

Wait, but wait: Sarah is normal, so she can be either HH or Hh. But if the mother is HH, Sarah is Hh. If the mother is Hh, Sarah could be Hh or hh. But since Sarah is normal, she can't be hh. So the mother must be HH, because that's the only way Sarah can't be hh.

Wait, but the problem states that Sarah is normal, so she must have at least one H. So the mother could be either HH or Hh, but if the mother is Hh, Sarah could be Hh (if she gets H from mother) or hh (if she gets h). Since Sarah is normal, in that scenario, she must have gotten H from her mother. So the mother could be Hh, but Sarah ends up Hh. But the problem is that if the mother is Hh, there's a 50% chance Sarah is normal (Hh) and 50% chance she has the disease (hh). But in reality, Sarah is normal, so she must be Hh.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify anything about Sarah's genotype beyond being normal. So Sarah's genotype is Hh because she received Xh from father and XH from mother (if mother is HH) or Xh from father and XH (with 50% chance) from Hh mother.

But wait, given that Sarah is normal, her genotype is either HH or Hh. But given that her father is Xh Y, she must have gotten Xh from him. So she must be Xh from father and X? from mother. So if her mother is XH XH, then Sarah is XH (from mother) and Xh (from father), so Hh. If her mother is XH Xh, Sarah could be XH (mother) and Xh (father) → Hh, or Xh (mother) and Xh (father) → hh. But Sarah is normal, so in the case where the mother is XH Xh, she would have 50% chance Hh and 50% hh. But since Sarah is normal, she must have Hh.

Wait, the problem doesn't state the genotype of Saul's wife, so perhaps we can't determine that, but we can determine Sarah's genotype because she's normal and her father is Xh Y. So Sarah's genotype is XH Xh → Hh.

So Sarah: Hh.

Putting it all together:

Sally: Hh
Sam: H\nearrow
Saul: h\nearrow
Sheryl: Hh
Shirley: HH
Sarah: Hh
Solomon: h\nearrow

Now, let's look at the options to see which one matches.

Looking through the options:

Option D: Sally: Hh, Sam: H\nearrow, Saul: h\nearrow, Sarah: Hh, Sheryl: Hh, Solomon: h\nearrow, Shirley: HH.

Yes, that matches.

Wait, let me check each option.

Option D:

Sally: Hh

Sam: H\nearrow

Saul: h\nearrow

Sarah: Hh

Sheryl: Hh

Solomon: h\nearrow

Shirley: HH

Yes, that's exactly what we have.

So the correct answer is D.

To determine the genotypes of Sally, Sam, Saul, Sarah, Sheryl, Solomon, and Shirley, we analyze the inheritance of the X-linked recessive hemophilia trait. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Sally and Sam**: Both are phenotypically normal. Since hemophilia is X-linked recessive, Sam must have the genotype **H\nearrow** (his X chromosome carries the normal allele, and he passes the Y chromosome to sons). Sally, having passed the hemophilia allele to her son Saul, must be a carrier, so her genotype is **Hh**.

2. **Saul**: As a hemophiliac, Saul must have the genotype **h\nearrow** (he inherited the X chromosome with the hemophilia allele from Sally and the Y chromosome from Sam).

3. **Sarah**: Sarah is Saul's daughter and is normal. She inherited the X chromosome with the hemophilia allele (**Xh**) from Saul and the normal allele (**XH**) from her mother. Thus, her genotype is **Hh**.

4. **Sheryl**: Sheryl is a normal daughter of Sally and Sam. She inherited one X chromosome from each parent. Since Sally is **Hh** and Sam is **H\nearrow**, Sheryl could be **HH** or **Hh**. However, Sheryl has a son, Solomon, who has hemophilia. For Solomon to have hemophilia, Sheryl must have passed the **Xh** allele, meaning Sheryl's genotype is **Hh**.

5. **Solomon**: As Sheryl's son and a hemophiliac, Solomon inherited the **Xh** allele from Sheryl and the Y chromosome from his father. Thus, his genotype is **h\nearrow**.

6. **Shirley**: Shirley is a normal daughter of Sally and Sam. She inherited one X chromosome from each parent. Since Sally is **Hh** and Sam is **H\nearrow**, Shirley could be **HH** or **Hh**. However, Shirley has six normal sons, and for all her sons to be normal, she must have passed only the **XH** allele. This is only possible if her genotype is **HH**.

### Final Genotypes:
- **Sally**: Hh  
- **Sam**: H\nearrow  
- **Saul**: h\nearrow  
- **Sarah**: Hh  
- **Sheryl**: Hh  
- **Solomon**: h\nearrow  
- **Shirley**: HH  

The correct answer is **D**.
