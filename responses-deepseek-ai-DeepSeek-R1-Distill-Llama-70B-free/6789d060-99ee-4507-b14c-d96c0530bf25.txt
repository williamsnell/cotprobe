Okay, so I need to answer this multiple-choice question about Feminist Therapy. The question describes a scenario where Fara, as a child, was assigned household responsibilities like her mother, while her brother did yard work with their father. The question is asking which part of Feminist Therapy addresses these issues.

Hmm, I remember that Feminist Therapy has several key components. Let me try to recall them. I think one of them is about gender roles and how they are socially constructed. Feminist therapists often look at how societal expectations around gender can lead to inequalities in responsibilities and opportunities.

The scenario here shows a clear division of labor based on gender. Fara helping in the kitchen, brother mowing the lawn—so it's about traditional gender roles being passed down through the family. So the question is, which part of Feminist Therapy deals with this?

Looking at the options:

A: Self-Concept Therapy – That sounds like it's about individual self-esteem or identity, maybe not directly about gender roles in the family.

B: Feminist Object Relations – I'm not too sure, but Object Relations usually deals with early relationships and how they shape the self. Feminist might focus on how gender influences these, but I'm not certain if this is the part that deals with family responsibilities.

C: Household Responsibilities – That sounds like it could be relevant. Maybe a part that specifically looks at how domestic work is divided.

D: Maternal Role Therapy – This might focus on the mother's role, but the question is broader, involving both parents and the children.

E: Empowerment Therapy – Empowerment is a key concept in Feminist Therapy, helping women to gain power and assertiveness. But does it specifically address the division of household tasks?

F: Family Dynamics Therapy – Family dynamics would look at how the family interacts and the roles each member plays. Since the question is about roles assigned based on gender within the family, this seems relevant.

G: Child Responsibility Therapy – This doesn't sound familiar. Maybe not a standard part of Feminist Therapy.

H: Women's Rights Therapy – That might focus more on broader societal issues rather than specific family role divisions.

Wait, I'm trying to remember specific theories. Feminist Therapy often examines how gender roles are learned and reinforced within the family. So the part that looks at how these roles are passed down through family dynamics would be important.

I think the key concept here is "gender role socialization," which is a part of Feminist Therapy. But looking at the options, the closest would be either F: Family Dynamics Therapy or B: Feminist Object Relations.

Alternatively, maybe there's a specific term. Oh, wait, I remember that Feminist Therapy includes looking at power dynamics and role socialization within families. So Family Dynamics Therapy would focus on how the family as a system assigns roles based on gender.

So the answer is probably F: Family Dynamics Therapy.

Wait, but another thought. There's also a concept called "gender role analysis" or something similar. Or perhaps it's about challenging traditional gender roles, which is a part of Feminist Therapy's approach.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is B: Feminist Object Relations. Object Relations theory is about early relationships, and feminist approaches might look at how these early interactions shape gender identities. But the scenario is more about the division of labor, which is a dynamic within the family rather than early relational development.

So I think F: Family Dynamics Therapy is the right choice because it's about the interactions and roles within the family structure, which in this case, assigns tasks based on gender.

The question revolves around identifying the part of Feminist Therapy that addresses the division of household responsibilities based on gender, as seen in Fara's childhood experience. Feminist Therapy often examines how societal gender roles are reinforced within families, leading to unequal task distribution. Among the options, Family Dynamics Therapy stands out as it focuses on the interactions and role assignments within the family structure, which aligns with the scenario described.

Answer: F
