Okay, so I need to figure out what near-money is and pick the correct example from the options given. I'm a bit rusty on economics terms, but I'll try to think it through.

I remember that money is usually categorized into different types. There's currency in circulation, like the cash we carry, and then there are demand deposits, which are the funds in your checking account that you can access immediately. But near-money is something a bit different.

From what I recall, near-money, or sometimes called quasi-money, refers to financial assets that aren't directly cash or demand deposits but can be easily converted into them. They're liquid, but not as liquid as cash. So they're close to money but not exactly money.

Looking at the options, I need to find which ones fit this description. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Near-monies are physical currencies. Wait, physical currencies are actual money, right? Like coins and banknotes. So that's not near-money; that's just money. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B: Long-term investment bonds. Bonds are usually investments that you hold for a longer period. They can be sold, but they might not be easily converted without a loss, especially if interest rates have changed. So B doesn't seem right.

Option C: Commodities used for barter. Commodities like oil or grains are physical goods and not easily converted into cash quickly. Barter systems are more about trading goods directly, not converting to money. So C doesn't fit.

Option D: Precious metals like gold and silver. Gold is often considered a store of value, but selling it quickly might not be as easy as other assets. It's more of a commodity, so I'm not sure if this counts as near-money. Maybe not the best fit.

Option E: Ownership stakes in real estate. Real estate is a tangible asset, but it's not liquid at all. Selling property takes time, so E is probably incorrect.

Option F: Digital currencies. Digital currencies like Bitcoin are more of an alternative currency rather than near-money. They can be considered a store of value but aren't exactly near-money in the traditional sense. So F might not be the right choice.

Option G: Assets quickly converted into currency or demand deposits, like savings accounts. This sounds exactly like what I was thinking earlier. Savings accounts are a prime example because they're not as liquid as checking accounts, but you can easily transfer funds to a checking account or withdraw cash. So G seems correct.

Option H: Non-convertible assets. If they're non-convertible, they can't be easily turned into cash, so H is the opposite of near-money.

Option I: Insurance policies with cash value. Some insurance policies do have cash value, like whole life insurance, but accessing that cash might take time and involve fees or penalties. They're not as quickly convertible, so I is probably not the answer.

Option J: Credit instruments like personal loans. These are debts, not assets. You can't convert a loan into cash; it's the opposite. So J is incorrect.

So after going through each option, G seems to be the correct answer. Near-monies are assets that can be quickly converted into currency or demand deposits, with savings accounts being a good example.

Near-money refers to financial assets that are not directly cash or demand deposits but can be easily converted into them. They are highly liquid but not as immediately accessible as cash. The correct example is assets that can be quickly converted into currency or demand deposits, such as savings accounts.

Answer: G
