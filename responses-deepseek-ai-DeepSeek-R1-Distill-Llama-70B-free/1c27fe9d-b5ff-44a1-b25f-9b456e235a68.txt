Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully to understand what's being asked.

The problem is about airflow through a duct. The duct has a constant rectangular cross-section of 2 by 1 feet. At a certain position, 20 feet from the end, the pressure is 18 psia, and the temperature is 500°F. The fluid exits the duct subsonically at 14.7 psia. The mass flow rate is 40 lbm/s. We're supposed to find the heat transfer per pound mass of fluid between that section and the exit. They give us a specific heat at constant pressure, c_p, of 0.26 Btu/lbm/°F. Friction is neglected, so I don't have to worry about that. 

Hmm, and there are two tables provided. Table 1 is the Rayleigh line for a perfect gas with k=1.4, and Table 2 is one-dimensional isentropic relations. I think I'll need to use these tables somewhere in the solution.

Okay, so the first thing that comes to mind is that this is a steady flow problem, so mass flow is constant. The duct's cross-section is constant, which probably means that the velocity doesn't change along the duct. Wait, but since it's a duct with varying pressure and temperature, maybe the velocity does change. Or maybe not, because the area is the same. Wait, in steady flow with constant area, if the density changes, the velocity could change. Hmm, but without friction and considering heat transfer, maybe it's a Rayleigh flow situation.

Wait, Rayleigh flow is about flow with heat transfer in a duct with constant area. That makes sense here because we're told to neglect friction, so the only other effect could be heat transfer. So yes, Rayleigh flow would be the model here.

So in Rayleigh flow, the stagnation temperature T0 is a key parameter. The heat transfer can be found using the change in stagnation temperature. The formula for heat transfer per unit mass is q = c_p (T02 - T01), where T01 is the stagnation temperature at the initial state and T02 is at the exit.

But wait, I need to find T01 and T02. Also, since the flow is subsonic at exit, that affects the calculations. So maybe I need to find the Mach number at the initial section and then relate it to the exit conditions.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Find the Mach number at the initial section (where pressure is 18 psia, temperature 500°F).
2. Using the Rayleigh line table, find the corresponding values for T0/T0*, T/T*, etc.
3. Determine the stagnation temperatures T01 and T02.
4. Since the exit is at p = 14.7 psia, find the corresponding Mach number at the exit.
5. Use the Rayleigh table again for the exit Mach number to find T0/T0*, etc.
6. Compute the heat transfer q = c_p (T02 - T01).

Wait, but maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

In Rayleigh flow, the stagnation temperature T0 is a function of the heat added. So if I can find T0 at the initial section and T0 at the exit, their difference multiplied by c_p will give the heat added per unit mass.

But how do I find the initial Mach number? Well, for that, I might need to use the isentropic relations because the stagnation properties are involved.

Wait, let's consider the initial state. The pressure is 18 psia, and the static temperature is 500°F. To find Mach number, I can use the relation involving the stagnation temperature. But wait, I'm not given the stagnation temperature directly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the stagnation temperature at the initial point. Then, using the Rayleigh table, I can find the corresponding Mach number and other properties.

Wait, but the given static temperature is 500°F. The stagnation temperature T0 would be higher than that for subsonic flow. Or wait, for subsonic flow, T0 is higher than T. So, to find T0, I can use the isentropic relation:

T0 = T * [1 + (k-1)/2 M^2]^(-1)

But I don't know M yet. Alternatively, perhaps using the Rayleigh line since it's a Rayleigh flow scenario.

In Rayleigh flow, the stagnation temperature is a function of the Mach number. So perhaps I can find the Mach number at the initial state using the pressure and temperature.

Wait, maybe it's better to first find the stagnation temperature at the initial section. Since the initial state is at 18 psia and 500°F, and the flow is subsonic, I can compute T0 from the static temperature.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to structure this.

1. Find the initial Mach number M1.

But without knowing the velocity or the speed of sound, how can I find M1? Alternatively, I can relate the stagnation properties using the given pressure and temperature.

Wait, perhaps I can use the isentropic relations first to find M1. Let me think: I can compute the stagnation pressure p01 from the given p1 and T1, assuming isentropic flow, but wait, no, because the flow is Rayleigh (with heat transfer), so it's not isentropic. Hmm, maybe that's complicating things.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the speed of sound at the initial state to find the velocity, but I don't have velocity given. Alternatively, maybe I can use the mass flow rate to find the velocity.

The mass flow rate is given as 40 lbm/s. The cross-sectional area A is 2ft *1ft = 2 sq.ft. The mass flow rate is rho * A * V = 40 lbm/s. So rho is the density in lbm/ft^3, V is velocity in ft/s.

But I need to find rho. To find rho, I can use the ideal gas equation. Since it's a perfect gas, p = (rho R T). But wait, what's R for air in imperial units?

R for air is 1716 ft·lb/lbm·°R (or sometimes 53.35 ft·lb/lbm·°R, but wait, no, 1716 is for lb units, but that's probably in different units. Wait, let me make sure. Actually, R for air is 53.3 ft·lbf/lbm·°R when using lbm, lbf, ft units. Alternatively, in more standard terms, R = 1716 ft·lb/(slug·°R), but that's for slugs. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the ideal gas law in consistent units.

Wait, perhaps it's better to convert the temperature to Rankine. T1 is 500°F, which is 500 + 459.67 = 959.67 °R.

So, p1 = 18 psia. R for air is 1716 ft·lb/(slug·°R), but I'm using lbm units here. So I need to convert R into lbm units. Since 1 slug is 32.174 lbm, so R for lbm would be 1716 / 32.174 ≈ 53.35 ft·lb/(lbm·°R).

So, the ideal gas law is p = rho R T. So rho = p/(R T).

p is 18 psia. To convert to lb/ft², since 1 psi = 144 lb/ft², so p = 18 * 144 = 2592 lb/ft².

So rho1 = 2592 lb/ft² / (53.35 ft·lb/(lbm·°R) * 959.67 °R).

Let me calculate that:

First, calculate the denominator: 53.35 * 959.67 ≈ 53.35 * 960 ≈ 51,264 (approximately).

So rho1 ≈ 2592 / 51264 ≈ 0.0505 lbm/ft³.

Wait, let me compute more accurately:

53.35 * 959.67 = let's compute 53.35 * 959.67.

53.35 * 950 = 53.35 * 900 = 48,015; 53.35*50=2,667.5 → 48,015 + 2,667.5 = 50,682.5. Then 53.35 *9.67 ≈ 53.35*10=533.5 - 53.35*(0.33)≈17.61 → 533.5 -17.61=515.89. So total is 50,682.5 + 515.89 ≈ 51,198.39.

So rho1 ≈ 2592 / 51198.39 ≈ 2592 / 5.12e4 ≈ approximately 0.0506 lbm/ft³.

Then, mass flow rate is rho * A * V = 40 lbm/s.

A is 2 ft². So,

40 = rho1 * 2 * V → V = 40 / (2 * rho1) = 20 / rho1.

So V ≈ 20 / 0.0506 ≈ 395.3 ft/s.

Now, the speed of sound a1 is sqrt(k R T) → Wait, but with the correct units. Alternatively, a = sqrt(k * R * T), where R is specific to the units.

Wait, in the ideal gas law, a = sqrt(γ R T). But R here is in ft·lb/lbm·°R, and T is in °R. So let's compute a1.

gamma (k) is 1.4.

So a1 = sqrt(1.4 * 53.35 * 959.67).

Compute 1.4 * 53.35 = 74.69. Then 74.69 * 959.67 ≈ let's compute 74.69 * 960 = approx 74.69 * 1000 = 74,690 - 74.69 * 40 = 74,690 - 2,987.6 = 71,702.4.

So a1 ≈ sqrt(71702.4) ≈ 267.8 ft/s.

So the Mach number M1 is V/a1 = 395.3 / 267.8 ≈ 1.476.

Wait, that's a problem because M1 is greater than 1, which would imply supersonic flow, but the question says the fluid leaves subsonically. Also, the initial section is 20 ft from the end, and the exit is at 14.7 psia, which is atmospheric pressure. So if M1 is 1.476, that's supersonic, but the exit is subsonic, which might not be possible unless there's a shock somewhere, but the problem says it's subsonic at exit, so maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check my calculations.

Wait, did I compute rho correctly? Let me recheck.

p1 = 18 psia = 18 * 144 = 2592 lb/ft².

R = 53.35 ft·lb/(lbm·°R).

T1 = 500°F = 959.67 °R.

So rho1 = p/(R T) = 2592 / (53.35 * 959.67).

Compute denominator: 53.35 * 959.67 ≈ let me compute it as 53 * 960 = 50,880, plus 0.35*960≈336 → 51,216.

So rho1 ≈ 2592 / 51216 ≈ 0.0506 lbm/ft³. That seems correct.

Then, V = 40/(2 * 0.0506) → 40/(0.1012) ≈ 395.3 ft/s. Correct.

a1 = sqrt(1.4 * 53.35 * 959.67) → Compute 1.4 * 53.35 = 74.69. Then 74.69 * 959.67 ≈ 74.69 * 960 ≈ 71,702.4. Square root is approx 267.8 ft/s. So M1 = 395.3 / 267.8 ≈ 1.476. So that's about M=1.48, which is supersonic. But the exit is subsonic, so that suggests that there's a problem. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Maybe the flow is subsonic at the initial section. Because if M1 were less than 1, then with heat addition, it could be that the exit is subsonic. But according to this calculation, M1 is about 1.476, which is supersonic, which would mean that without a throat, the flow couldn't go subsonic. Hmm, perhaps I made an error in using the wrong approach.

Alternatively, maybe I should approach this using the Rayleigh flow tables. Since the problem gives us Table 1 for Rayleigh line, perhaps I should use that.

In Rayleigh flow, the stagnation temperature ratio is a function of Mach number. Also, the stagnation pressure and other properties are functions of M.

Wait, but without knowing the Mach number at the initial section, I can't directly use the table. So perhaps I need to find M1 using the given static pressure and temperature.

Wait, another approach: Since the flow is subsonic at exit, the initial flow could be either subsonic or supersonic. But if the initial M is supersonic, adding heat would make it go towards M=1, but if it's already above M=1, adding heat could either increase or decrease M depending on the situation. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the stagnation temperature T01 at the initial section, and then determine M1 from that.

Wait, the stagnation temperature T01 can be found from the static temperature T1 and the Mach number M1 using the isentropic relation:

T01 = T1 * [1 + (k-1)/2 * M1^2]

Similarly, the stagnation pressure p01 can be found from p1 and M1 using the isentropic relation.

But I don't know M1 yet. So perhaps I can use the Rayleigh line table to relate M1 and the stagnation quantities.

Wait, the Rayleigh line table gives T0/T0* and T/T*. So, for a given Mach number M, T0/T0* is the ratio of the stagnation temperature to its value at M*, which is the critical Mach number where the flow would be choked.

Wait, but without knowing M1, I'm stuck again. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the mass flow rate is given, and the area is constant, to find M1.

Wait, mass flow rate is rho * A * V = 40 lbm/s.

We can write this as rho * A * V = 40.

But rho can be written in terms of p and R and T, as before.

Alternatively, using the mass flow parameter for Rayleigh flow. The mass flow parameter is m = (rho V A). For a perfect gas, this can be expressed in terms of M and stagnation properties.

Wait, but I'm getting too deep into equations without a clear path. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, another thought: Since the duct has a constant cross-sectional area and the flow is subsonic at exit, perhaps the initial flow is also subsonic. So I must have made a mistake in my earlier calculation that suggested M1 is supersonic. Let me re-examine that.

Wait, the initial calculation gave M1 ≈1.476, which would be supersonic. But the problem states that the fluid leaves subsonically, implying that the exit Mach number M2 is less than 1. But if M1 is greater than 1, and the flow is moving towards the exit, how can it become subsonic without a throat? That doesn't seem possible because, in a duct of constant area, without a throat, subsonic flow cannot accelerate to supersonic, and supersonic flow cannot decelerate to subsonic without a shock, which would violate the steady flow assumption. So perhaps my initial calculation is wrong.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated the speed of sound a1. Let me recalculate a1.

a1 = sqrt(k R T1), where R is 53.35 ft·lb/(lbm·°R), T1 is 959.67 °R.

So, a1 = sqrt(1.4 * 53.35 * 959.67).

Compute 1.4 * 53.35 = 74.69.

74.69 * 959.67 ≈ let me compute 74.69 * 900 = 67,221 and 74.69 *59.67≈ approx 74.69 *60=4,481.4, minus 74.69*0.33≈24.65 → 4,481.4 -24.65 ≈4,456.75.

So total is 67,221 +4,456.75 ≈71,677.75.

So a1 = sqrt(71,677.75) ≈ 267.8 ft/s. That's correct.

Then V is 395.3 ft/s. So M1=V/a1 ≈1.476. Hmm.

But that suggests that the initial flow is supersonic, which would make the exit flow also supersonic unless some kind of shock occurs, but the problem says the exit is subsonic. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe the assumption that it's Rayleigh flow is incorrect, but the problem does say to neglect friction, which points towards Rayleigh flow.

Wait, perhaps I should not calculate the Mach number this way. Maybe I should instead use the Rayleigh line tables, considering that the stagnation temperatures are the key.

Wait, let's think differently. Since the problem gives the mass flow rate, maybe I can find the Mach number at the initial section using the mass flow parameter.

The mass flow parameter for a duct is given by:

m = (p A) / (sqrt(T)) * M * sqrt(k / R) * (1 + (k-1)/2 M^2)^(- (k+1)/(2(k-1)) )

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using the relation for mass flow in terms of stagnation properties.

Wait, from the Rayleigh flow equations, the mass flow rate can be expressed as:

m = (p_0 A) / (sqrt(T_0)) ) * sqrt(k) / (R) * M * (1 + (k-1)/2 M^2)^{ (k+1)/(2(k-1)) } }

But I'm not sure about that. Maybe it's better to use the relation between M and the stagnation temperatures.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the Mach number at the initial state
