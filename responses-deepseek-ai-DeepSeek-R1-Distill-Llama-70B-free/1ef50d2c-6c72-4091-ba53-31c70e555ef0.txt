Okay, so I have this question about Venus figurines and which continent they're mostly found on. I'm a bit rusty on my archaeology, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Venus figurines are these small statues depicting women, often with exaggerated features like large breasts and hips. They're usually associated with prehistoric times, like the Stone Age. I think they were found in Europe, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, wasn't there a famous one called the Venus of Willendorf? Yeah, that rings a bell. Willendorf is in Austria, right? So that's in Europe.

But wait, I also heard about some being found in other places. Like, maybe Russia or parts of Asia? Or was that a different type of figurine? Oh, right, some were found in Siberia, which is in Asia. But I think the majority are still in Europe. Let me think about other examples. There's the Venus of Lespugue, which is in France, another European country. And I believe several others have been discovered in Spain, Germany, and other European locations.

So putting it all together, even though some Venus figurines are found in Asia, the majority are in Europe. So the answer should be Europe, which is option I.

The Venus figurines are prehistoric statues typically found in Europe, with notable examples like the Venus of Willendorf in Austria and the Venus of Lespugue in France. While some have been discovered in Asia, the majority are in Europe.
