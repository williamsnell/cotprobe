Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about angular motion. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says there's a bar pivoting about one end. It initially has an angular velocity of 8 rad/sec clockwise. Then, it's subjected to a constant angular deceleration. This deceleration acts for a certain time until two conditions are met: the bar has an angular displacement of 10 radians counterclockwise from its position when the deceleration started, and the total angular distance moved in this time is 26 radians.

Wait, so angular displacement is 10 rad counterclockwise. But the total angular distance is 26 rad. Oh right, displacement is the net change, considering direction, while distance is the total, regardless of direction. So like, if something goes back and forth, the displacement could be less than the total distance.

The question is asking for the angular velocity at the end of this time interval. The options are various velocities, some clockwise, some counterclockwise.

I remember that in angular kinematics, the equations are similar to linear motion but with angular terms. The key equations are:

1. θ = θ₀ + ω₀ t + (1/2) α t²
2. ω² = ω₀² + 2 α (θ - θ₀)
3. ω = ω₀ + α t

But wait, I need to be careful with the signs here since the problem involves direction changes.

So let's outline what we know:

- Initial angular velocity, ω₀ = 8 rad/s clockwise. Let's say clockwise is positive, or maybe negative—I need to decide on a sign convention. Hmm, usually counterclockwise is positive, so I'll go with that. So ω₀ = -8 rad/s.

- The deceleration is constant. Since it's a deceleration, the angular acceleration α will be opposite in sign to the initial velocity. So if the initial velocity is negative (clockwise), the acceleration will be positive (trying to slow it down and bring it to zero before possibly reversing direction).

- The angular displacement θ is 10 rad counterclockwise. Since counterclockwise is positive, θ = +10 rad.

- The total angular distance moved is 26 rad. So the bar has rotated a total of 26 radians in that time, but the net displacement is 10 radians. That suggests that part of the motion is in one direction, and part is in the other.

Wait, no. Wait, the initial velocity is clockwise (-8 rad/s). If it's decelerating, it's slowing down. So at some point, the bar will come to a stop and then start moving in the opposite direction (counterclockwise). So the motion is first in the negative direction, comes to zero, then turns positive.

So the angular displacement is the net change. If the total distance is 26 rad, and the net displacement is 10 rad, that implies that the bar went past the starting point after turning around. Because the displacement is 10 rad counterclockwise, which is in the positive direction.

Wait, perhaps the bar rotates in the negative direction (clockwise) for some time until it stops, then starts rotating in the positive direction (counterclockwise). The total distance is the sum of the clockwise rotation before stopping plus the counterclockwise rotation after.

So let's model this. Let me think about the motion in two phases:

1. Phase 1: Bar rotates clockwise (negative) until it stops.
2. Phase 2: Bar rotates counterclockwise (positive) until the total displacement is +10 rad and total distance is 26 rad.

First, find the time when the bar comes to a stop. At that point, ω = 0.

Using equation ω = ω₀ + α t.

Wait, but I don't know α yet. Hmm, maybe I can find α using the overall motion.

Wait, but perhaps using the second equation, the one that relates ω² to θ and α. But wait, that equation is for when the acceleration is constant, which it is here.

Wait, let's think again. The problem states that the bar starts with ω₀ = -8 rad/s, has an angular displacement of θ = +10 rad, and the total angular distance is 26 rad.

Wait, angular displacement is θ =10 rad ccw, but the total angular distance is 26 rad. So the bar's total rotation is 26 rad in the given time. But displacement is net change, so that must mean that part of the motion is clockwise, part is ccw.

Wait, no. If the displacement is 10 rad ccw, that's the net. So the bar might have rotated more than 10 rad, but in such a way that the net is 10.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the equation that relates initial velocity, final velocity, displacement, and acceleration.

The equation is: ω² = ω₀² + 2 α θ

Wait, but θ is displacement, not distance. So θ is 10 rad.

But wait, the problem says the total angular distance is 26 rad. So perhaps we have to consider the total rotation, regardless of direction. So displacement is net change, but distance is the sum of all rotations, considering direction.

Wait, but in the equation, θ is displacement, which is the net angular change. So if the bar starts at position θ₀, ends at θ₀ +10 rad, but the total distance it moved is 26 rad, which would mean that it went back and forth.

Hmm, perhaps I can model this scenario. Let's say the bar first rotates clockwise until it stops, then starts rotating counterclockwise.

So the total displacement is 10 rad ccw. So the bar ends up 10 rad ccw from where it started. But the total distance is 26 rad, which is the sum of the clockwise rotation (let's say θ1) and the counterclockwise rotation (θ2), so θ1 + θ2 =26 rad.

But θ2 - θ1 =10 rad, because the net displacement is θ2 - θ1 =10 rad.

So I can set up two equations:

θ1 + θ2 =26

θ2 - θ1 =10

Solving these:

Adding the equations: 2θ2 =36 → θ2=18 rad.

Substituting back: 18 - θ1=10 → θ1=8 rad.

So the bar first rotates 8 rad clockwise, then 18 rad counterclockwise, making the net displacement 10 rad counterclockwise, and total distance 26 rad.

Now, the first phase is the bar rotating 8 rad clockwise with initial velocity ω₀=-8 rad/s, and it comes to a stop. So at the end of phase 1, ω=0.

We can find the angular acceleration α.

Using the equation: ω² = ω₀² + 2 α θ

Wait, but θ here is the displacement in phase 1, which is -8 rad (since it's clockwise). So:

0² = (-8)^2 + 2 α (-8)

So 0 =64 -16 α → 16 α=64 → α=4 rad/s².

Wait, but α is the angular acceleration. Since the bar is decelerating, and initial velocity is negative, the acceleration would be positive (to slow it down, opposite direction).

So α is positive. So α=4 rad/s².

Now, phase 1 is the bar moving from θ=0 to θ=-8 rad.

In phase 1, initialω=-8 rad/s, final ω=0, angular displacement θ=-8 rad, acceleration α=4 rad/s².

Using the equation: ω = ω₀ + α t.

For phase 1, 0 = -8 + 4 t1 → t1=2 seconds.

So phase 1 takes 2 seconds, and the bar stops.

Phase 2 is the bar moving from θ=-8 rad to θ=10 rad. Wait no, wait. The total displacement is 10 rad from the initial position. So starting at 0, after phase 1 it's at -8 rad, and phase 2 it goes from -8 rad to 10 rad, so a displacement of 18 rad in phase 2.

So in phase 2, initialω is 0 (since it stopped), and it starts moving in the positive direction with acceleration α=4 rad/s².

Wait, but wait, is the acceleration the same in both phases? In phase 1, it was decelerating (so positive α), and in phase 2, it's accelerating in the positive direction, so same α.

So for phase 2, the equation for displacement is:

θ = θ1 + ω₁ t2 + (1/2) α t2²

Wait, θ is the displacement during phase 2, which is 18 rad. Because phase 2 starts at -8 rad, ends at +10 rad, so displacement is 18 rad.

But θ2 =18 rad.

Wait, no. Wait, in phase 2, the displacement is 18 rad. So:

18 = 0 * t2 + (1/2) *4 * t2² → 18= 2 t2² → t2²=9 → t2=3 seconds.

So phase 2 takes 3 seconds.

The final angular velocity at the end of phase 2 is:

ω = ω₁ + α t2 = 0 +4 *3=12 rad/s counterclockwise.

So the final angular velocity is 12 rad/s counterclockwise.

Looking at the options, option F is 12 rad/s counterclockwise.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another approach: using the overall motion.

We can model the entire motion as starting from ω₀=-8, ending at ω, with displacement θ=10, and total distance 26.

Wait, but the total distance is tricky because it's the sum of the absolute rotations. Alternatively, perhaps we can consider the time t as the sum of t1 and t2, which is 2 +3=5 seconds.

Alternatively, using the equation:

θ = θ₀ + ω₀ t + (1/2) α t².

But θ is 10 rad, θ₀ is 0, ω₀=-8, α=4.

So:

10 = 0 + (-8)*t + 0.5 *4 *t² → 10= -8t + 2 t² → 2t² -8t -10=0.

Divide by 2: t² -4t -5=0.

Solutions: t = [4 ±√(16 +20)] /2 → [4±√36]/2 → [4±6]/2.

Positive solution: (4+6)/2=10/2=5 seconds. So t=5 seconds.

So the time is 5 seconds, which makes sense as phase1 (2s) + phase2 (3s).

Now, the final angular velocity is ω = ω₀ + α t = -8 +4*5= -8 +20=12 rad/s.

Which is 12 rad/s counterclockwise. So yes, option F is correct.

To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the bar in two phases:

### Phase 1: Bar rotates clockwise until it stops
- Initial angular velocity: \( \omega_0 = -8 \, \text{rad/s} \) (clockwise, negative by convention).
- Final angular velocity: \( \omega = 0 \, \text{rad/s} \).
- Angular displacement: \( \theta_1 = -8 \, \text{rad} \) (clockwise).
- Angular acceleration: \( \alpha = 4 \, \text{rad/s}^2 \) (positive, as it opposes the initial motion).

Using the kinematic equation \( \omega^2 = \omega_0^2 + 2 \alpha \theta \):
\[
0^2 = (-8)^2 + 2(4)(-8) \implies 0 = 64 - 64 \implies \alpha = 4 \, \text{rad/s}^2.
\]

Using \( \omega = \omega_0 + \alpha t \) to find the time:
\[
0 = -8 + 4t_1 \implies t_1 = 2 \, \text{seconds}.
\]

### Phase 2: Bar rotates counterclockwise
- Initial angular velocity: \( \omega_1 = 0 \, \text{rad/s} \).
- Angular displacement: \( \theta_2 = +18 \, \text{rad} \) (counterclockwise, total displacement from \(-8 \, \text{rad}\) to \(+10 \, \text{rad}\)).
- Angular acceleration: \( \alpha = 4 \, \text{rad/s}^2 \).

Using \( \theta = \omega_1 t + \frac{1}{2} \alpha t^2 \):
\[
18 = 0 \cdot t_2 + \frac{1}{2}(4)t_2^2 \implies 18 = 2t_2^2 \implies t_2^2 = 9 \implies t_2 = 3 \, \text{seconds}.
\]

The final angular velocity at the end of Phase 2 is:
\[
\omega = \omega_1 + \alpha t_2 = 0 + 4(3) = 12 \, \text{rad/s} \, \text{counterclockwise}.
\]

### Total motion
- Total time: \( t = t_1 + t_2 = 2 + 3 = 5 \, \text{seconds} \).
- Total angular displacement: \( \theta = 10 \, \text{rad} \, \text{counterclockwise} \).
- Total angular distance: \( 26 \, \text{rad} \) (sum of \( 8 \, \text{rad} \) clockwise and \( 18 \, \text{rad} \) counterclockwise).

Thus, the final angular velocity is \( 12 \, \text{rad/s} \, \text{counterclockwise} \).

### Correct Option:
**F: 12 rad/sec counterclockwise**
