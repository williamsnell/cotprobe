Okay, so I have this physics problem here about optics, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that a plane mirror in contact with a converging lens of focal length f is equivalent to a concave spherical mirror with radius of curvature f. And I have to choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that when lenses and mirrors are combined, their properties can sometimes be equivalent to other optical elements. So I need to think about how a converging lens and a plane mirror work together.

Wait, a converging lens, also known as a convex lens, has a positive focal length. Its function is to converge light rays. When we place a plane mirror right after the lens, what happens? I think the mirror reflects the light back.

Let me visualize this setup. The converging lens takes incoming parallel rays and focuses them to a point at its focal point, which is at a distance f from the lens. Now, if a plane mirror is placed at this focal point, it would reflect the converging rays. But wait, the mirror is in contact with the lens, so maybe it's placed right where the focal point is.

Alternatively, perhaps the mirror is placed at the back of the lens. So the converging lens focuses the light, and the plane mirror reflects it back. I'm a bit confused about the exact configuration here.

Wait, I think when a plane mirror is in contact with a lens, it's like attaching the mirror to the lens. So suppose the lens is on one side, and the mirror is attached to the other side. Then, if the mirror is a plane mirror, it's flat, but because it's combined with the lens, the overall effect might be similar to a mirror with some curvature.

I remember something about the lens acting to change the effective focal length of the mirror. Oh, wait! There's a concept where a lens and a mirror together can form a system that behaves like a single mirror. But I'm not exactly remembering the formula.

Let me think about the mirror equation. The radius of curvature R of a mirror relates to its focal length f_mirror by R = 2f_mirror. So if the equivalent mirror is concave, its focal length would be positive.

But how does combining a lens and a mirror affect the focal length? Let me try to model this.

When a converging lens is placed in front of a plane mirror, the system's focal length changes. Let's assume the light comes from the left, hits the lens, which focuses it, and then the mirror reflects it back. The effective focal length of the system would depend on the lens's focal length.

Wait, I think the formula for the equivalent focal length when a lens of focal length f is placed a distance d in front of a mirror is something like 1/f_eq = 1/f + 2/d. But wait, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, I remember that for a spherical mirror, the focal length is R/2. So if the combined system is equivalent to a concave mirror with radius R, then its focal length would be R/2.

Wait, but the problem says the equivalent is a concave mirror with radius of curvature f. So the focal length of that mirror would be f/2. So the equivalent mirror has a focal length of f/2.

But how does the lens and mirror combination produce this? Let's think about the lens first. The converging lens has focal length f, so when light comes in parallel, it focuses at f. Then the mirror reflects the light. Since the mirror is at the focal point, the reflection would be such that the light diverges as if coming from the focal point of the mirror.

Wait, perhaps the system acts like a mirror with twice the focal length of the lens. Or maybe half. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, I think the combination of a converging lens and a plane mirror can be equivalent to a concave mirror. Let's model it as the mirror being at a certain position relative to the lens.

Imagine that the mirror is placed at the focal plane of the lens. So when parallel rays come in, the lens focuses them to a point at f. The mirror then reflects them. So the reflected rays would appear to diverge from that focal point. But the mirror is flat, so the reflected rays would spread out as if from a point source behind the mirror.

Wait, but in this case, the system would act like a diverging lens, wouldn't it? Or maybe like a concave mirror. Hmm.

Alternatively, consider that the converging lens is placed in front of the plane mirror. The mirror's reflection would cause the light to behave as if there's a virtual image behind the mirror. But I'm not sure how that translates into an equivalent mirror.

Wait, another approach: the combination of a lens and a mirror can be thought of as forming a single optical element. For a converging lens and a plane mirror placed at the focal point, the system is similar to a concave mirror. Let me try to calculate this.

When a plane mirror is placed a distance d behind a converging lens, the effective focal length (f_eff) of the combination is given by 1/f_eff = 1/f_lens + 1/d. But wait, I'm not certain about this formula. Alternatively, maybe 1/f_eff = (1/f_lens) + 2*(1/d), but I'm not sure.

Wait, no. Let me think again. When you have a lens and a mirror at a distance d from the lens, the mirror's focal length (if it were a spherical mirror) would be R/2. But in this case, the mirror is plane, so its focal length is infinite, R = infinity.

But when combined with the lens, perhaps the effective focal length becomes something else. Let's model it as the mirror being at a distance d from the lens.

Wait, another thought: the lens focuses the incoming parallel rays to a point at f. The mirror is right there, so the reflected rays would appear to come from that focus. So the system would act as if it's a point source at f. But a concave mirror's focus is at R/2, so if the system's effective focal length is f, then R would be 2f. Wait, no, because for a concave mirror, the focal length is R/2. So if the effective focal length is f, then R would be 2f.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again. If the combination of the lens and mirror makes the effective focal length f_eff, then the radius of curvature R of the equivalent concave mirror would be R = 2 f_eff.

But in this case, the lens has focal length f, and the mirror is placed at f. So the reflected rays would behave as if the mirror has a focal length of f. So R would be 2f. But the question says the equivalent is a concave mirror with radius f. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, the question says the combination is equivalent to a concave mirror with radius of curvature f. So R is f, which would make the focal length R/2 = f/2.

But I thought the combination would have a focal length of f, leading to R=2f. So I'm getting confused here.

Let me try another approach. Think about the mirror equation. For a spherical mirror, the focal length is R/2. If the equivalent mirror is concave with radius f, then its focal length is f/2.

So, the combination of the lens and the mirror must have an effective focal length of f/2.

How does the lens and mirror system produce this?

Imagine that the lens takes incoming parallel rays and focuses them at f. The mirror is placed at this focus, so the reflected rays would diverge as if they were coming from a point at f behind the mirror. Wait, but the mirror is flat, so the reflection would make the virtual image appear at 2f from the lens.

Wait, maybe that's not right. Let me think: when the mirror is placed at the focal point of the lens, any ray coming into the lens parallel to the axis will focus at the mirror. Then, upon reflection, that ray will travel back along the same path. So the effect would be that the system (lens + mirror) reflects the light in a way similar to a concave mirror.

But I'm not entirely getting the picture. Maybe I should think about the reflection of the focal point.

Wait, another approach: when a converging lens is in contact with a plane mirror, the mirror acts like a concave mirror with twice the focal length of the lens. Or maybe half.

Wait, I've heard before that a plano-convex lens with a mirror attached to its flat side can act as a concave mirror. But I'm not recalling the exact relationship.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the lens maker's formula or some system of considering the lens and mirror as a single element.

Wait, the mirror is a plane mirror, so its radius of curvature is infinite. But when combined with the lens, the equivalent system's radius of curvature becomes finite.

Alternatively, perhaps the lens changes the effective focal length of the mirror. Since a converging lens can focus the light, the mirror's reflection after focusing would make the equivalent focal point closer.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the options and see which makes sense.

The options are:

A: plane mirror, radius f → No, because the question says it's equivalent to a concave mirror.

B: convex mirror of radius 2f → No, convex mirrors have virtual foci, but the question is about concave.

C: concave of radius f/2 → Then the focal length would be f/4.

D: spherical mirror with infinite radius → That would be a plane mirror.

E: concave mirror of radius 2f → Focal length f_mirror = f.

F: not equivalent → No, the question states that it is equivalent.

G: convex mirror of radius f → No, because again, the question says concave.

H: concave mirror with radius -2f → Radius can't be negative? Or does it just indicate direction. Hmm, radius is a magnitude, so maybe not.

I: concave mirror of radius f → Focal length f/2.

J: convex mirror with radius -f → Again, radius is positive.

Wait, the question states that the combination is equivalent to a concave mirror with radius of curvature f. So that would correspond to option I.

But earlier, I thought that if the focal length is f/2, then the radius is f. So that's consistent with option I.

But why? How does the combination of a lens with focal length f and a plane mirror give a concave mirror with radius f?

Wait, maybe I should model the system as follows. The converging lens has a focal length f. When a plane mirror is placed at the focal plane, the combination reflects the rays such that the effective focal length of the system is f/2.

Because the mirror is at the focal point, the reflection would cause the rays to behave as if they're coming from a point that's f/2 behind the mirror. Hmm, maybe that's not the right way to think about it.

Alternatively, think of the lens as changing the effective position of the mirror's focal point. Since the mirror is flat, its focal point is at infinity. But the lens brings the focal point closer.

Wait, another approach: Imagine the system as a converging lens followed by a plane mirror. The lens takes incoming light and focuses it at f. The mirror reflects it back. For an object at infinity, the lens focuses it at f, and then the mirror reflects it back, so the image is formed at f on the other side. But how does this compare to a concave mirror?

A concave mirror would focus incoming parallel rays to its focal point. So if the combined system does the same, then the focal length of the equivalent mirror would be f. But wait, then the radius would be 2f. So that would correspond to option E.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me try to find a formula or a more precise method.

I think the key idea is the effective focal length of the combination. When a plane mirror is placed a distance d behind a lens, the effective focal length f_eff is given by 1/f_eff = 1/f_lens + 1/d. But wait, I'm not sure about this formula.

Alternatively, I remember that when a lens is placed in front of a mirror, the combination's focal length is f_eff = (f_lens * d) / (f_lens + d). But I'm not confident about this.

Wait, maybe I should approach this with the concept of image formation. Let's consider a point object at infinity. The converging lens focuses it at f. The mirror reflects it, so the image is formed at f on the other side of the mirror. Now, for a concave mirror, an object at infinity produces an image at its focal point. So if the equivalent mirror has its focal point at f, then the radius is 2f. So the radius would be 2f, making option E correct.

Wait, but the question says the radius is f, not 2f. So that would mean the focal length is f/2, which would correspond to option I, which says radius f.

Hmm, I'm getting more confused now. Maybe I should think about the mirror equation.

The mirror equation is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di, where do is the object distance and di is the image distance. For an object at infinity, do = infinity, so di = f.

In the case of the lens and mirror system, the object is at infinity. The lens focuses it at f, then the mirror reflects it. So the image would be at f on the other side of the mirror. So for the equivalent mirror, the image distance di would be 2f, because the image is at f beyond the mirror.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the reference points. Let me think again. The lens focuses the light at f, so the mirror is at that point. So the reflection would cause the light to appear as if it's coming from a virtual image that's 2f behind the lens? Or is it f beyond the mirror?

Alternatively, the mirror is right at the focal point. So the incoming rays converge to f, hit the mirror, and then diverge again as if coming from f. So the system behaves like a concave mirror with focal length f. Because the focal point is at f.

Wait, but a concave mirror's focal length is R/2. So if the focal length is f, then R would be 2f. So the equivalent mirror has R=2f, which is option E.

But the question states that it's equivalent to a concave mirror with R=f. So this contradicts that.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in considering the position. Let me try to model it with a diagram.

Imagine the converging lens at position x=0, and the plane mirror is placed at x = f. So any light coming from the left (negative side) will be focused at x = f by the lens, then reflected by the mirror. So the reflected light appears to come from x = 2f on the left side.

Wait, no. Let me think: the mirror is at x = f. So the converging point is at x = f. When the light reflects off the mirror, it would travel back, and the virtual image would appear at x = 2f on the same side as the incoming light. So from the left side, the image is at x = 2f.

Now, a concave mirror would produce a real image at its focal point when the object is at infinity. So if the equivalent mirror has its focal point at x = 2f, then for a concave mirror, the focal length would be 2f, so radius R = 4f.

Wait, that doesn't match any of the options. None of the options have 4f.

Alternatively, maybe I've gotten the position wrong. Perhaps the mirror is placed in contact with the lens, so at x=0. But that can't be, because the lens's focal point is at x=f.

Wait, perhaps the mirror is placed on the other side of the lens, so the lens is between the object and the mirror. So the object is at the left, the lens is at x=0, the mirror is at x=d. Then, the light is focused at x=f, then reflected by the mirror at x=d.

Wait, but if the mirror is in contact with the lens, then d would be zero. But that would make the mirror at x=0, same as the lens, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the mirror is placed at the focal point, x = f. So the lens focuses the light at x = f, which is where the mirror is. So the light is reflected back, and for an observer on the left side, the image appears to come from x = 2f.

Wait, so the system's focal length is 2f. But a concave mirror's focal length is R/2, so R would be 4f. But none of the options have 4f. So I'm even more confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the focal length of the equivalent mirror is f, making R=2f. So that's option E.

But the question says the radius is f. So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the mirror's radius. The radius of curvature is the distance from the mirror to its center of curvature. So if the equivalent mirror has a radius f, then the focal length is f/2.

So the system's focal length is f/2. How does that come about from the combination?

Maybe the lens acts to shorten the effective focal length. So when the mirror is placed at the focal point, the combination's focal length is f/2.

But I'm not entirely clear on this. I think I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should make an educated guess based on elimination.

The question asks if it's equivalent to a concave mirror with R=f. So looking at the options, option I says "equivalent to a concave mirror of radius f."

So the correct answer would be I.

To determine the equivalence of a plane mirror in contact with a converging lens of focal length \( f \), we analyze the optical system as follows:

1. **Converging Lens and Plane Mirror Setup**:  
   A converging lens focuses incoming parallel rays to a point at its focal length \( f \). When a plane mirror is placed at this focal point, the mirror reflects the focused rays. The reflected rays behave as if they originate from a point behind the mirror, creating an effective optical system.

2. **Equivalent Concave Mirror**:  
   The combination of the converging lens and the plane mirror can be treated as a single optical element. Specifically, the system acts like a concave spherical mirror. For a concave mirror, the radius of curvature \( R \) is related to its focal length \( f_{\text{mirror}} \) by \( R = 2f_{\text{mirror}} \).

3. **Focal Length of the Equivalent Mirror**:  
   In this case, the effective focal length of the combined system is \( f/2 \), as
