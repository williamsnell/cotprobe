Okay, so I have this statistics problem here about miniature poodles. The question is about finding the percentage of poodles that have a height exceeding 14 inches. The data given is a mean height of 12 inches and a standard deviation of 1.8 inches. Heights are measured to the nearest inch. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

Alright, let me think. Since the heights are measured to the nearest inch, when the problem says "exceeding 14 inches," does that mean 14 inches and above, or should I consider that the measurement could be 14.5 or something? Oh wait, no. If it's measured to the nearest inch, then 14 inches would include anything from 13.5 up to 14.5. But wait, the question is about exceeding 14 inches. So maybe I should interpret it as strictly greater than 14 inches. Or does it mean 14 inches and above? Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Wait, the way the question is phrased: "exceeding 14 inches." So that would be more than 14 inches. But since we're measuring to the nearest inch, if a poodle is 14.1 inches, it would be rounded to 14 inches. So to exceed 14, the actual height would have to be more than 14.5 inches, right? Because anything from 14.5 up would round up to 15 inches. So I think the correct approach is to consider heights greater than 14 inches as those that are 14.5 inches and above, because those would round to 15 inches. So the problem becomes finding the percentage of poodles with heights greater than 14.5 inches.

Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think again. If the height is measured to the nearest inch, then a poodle that's 14 inches tall is considered exactly 14. So if the question is about exceeding 14 inches, that would be 15 inches and above. Because 14 inches is the cutoff for 14, so anything above that would be 15 or more. So perhaps I should model the problem as finding the probability that a poodle's height is greater than or equal to 15 inches.

But wait, no, that's not right. If the measurement is to the nearest inch, then a poodle that's 14.4 inches would be measured as 14 inches, and 14.5 would round up to 15 inches. So for a poodle's actual height to be recorded as exceeding 14 inches (i.e., 15 inches or more), their actual height must be 14.5 inches or higher. So the correct z-score would be for 14.5 inches.

So, first, I need to calculate the z-score for 14.5 inches. The formula for z-score is (X - μ)/σ, where μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation.

Plugging in the numbers: (14.5 - 12)/1.8 = 2.5 /1.8. Let me compute that. 2.5 divided by 1.8 is approximately 1.3889.

So the z-score is about 1.39. Now, I need to find the probability that a poodle's height is greater than 14.5 inches, which corresponds to the area under the normal curve to the right of z=1.39.

Looking at the standard normal distribution table, I should find the area to the left of z=1.39 and subtract it from 1 to get the area to the right.

Looking up z=1.39. The standard table gives the area to the left. So for z=1.39, the value is approximately 0.9177. So the area to the right is 1 - 0.9177 = 0.0823, or 8.23%.

Wait, but the options don't have 8.23%. The closest option is F:10 percent, or maybe B:2.5% or C:5%. Hmm, that's confusing. Did I make a mistake in my approach?

Wait, perhaps I should reconsider the initial assumption. Maybe the question is not about the exact height but the measured height. So if a poodle's height is measured to the nearest inch, the possible values are integers. So the question is about poodles whose height is greater than 14 inches. Since each measurement is an integer, the next integer above 14 is 15. So perhaps I should find the probability of the actual height being at least 14.5 inches (which would round to 15) or higher.

Wait, that's the same approach as before, leading to z=1.39 and about 8.23%. But the options don't have 8%, so maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the measured height as 14 inches being the cutoff. So any poodle with a height of 14 inches or more (measured) would include actual heights from 13.5 up to 14.5. But the question is about exceeding 14 inches. So, if the measurement is 14, that includes up to 14.499... So to exceed 14 inches, the measurement would have to be 15 inches. So same as before, we're looking for heights >=14.5 inches.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the measured height, so height >14 inches, which would correspond to actual heights >14 inches. So then, the cutoff would be 14.0 inches. Let me recalculate the z-score in that case.

So X =14.0 inches.

Z = (14.0 -12)/1.8 = 2.0 /1.8 ≈1.1111.

Looking up z=1.11 in the standard normal table. The area to the left of z=1.11 is about 0.8665. So the area to the right is 1 - 0.8665 = 0.1335, or 13.35%. Hmm, but the options don't have 13%, but there is option G:15% and F:10%. So that's not matching either.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. Perhaps the question is considering the measured height as a continuous variable. So when the question says "height exceeding 14 inches," perhaps it's considering the actual height, not the rounded one. So in that case, the cutoff is 14 inches exactly, not 14.5.

So in that case, the z-score would be (14 -12)/1.8 = 2/1.8 ≈1.1111. So the area to the right is 1 - 0.8665 = 0.1335, which is about 13.35%. So approximately 13%, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is considering 14 inches as the rounded value, and poodles have to be taller than 14, meaning their actual height is 14.5 or more.

Wait, let's go back to the problem statement. It says, "height is measured to the nearest inch." So when the problem asks for the percentage of poodles having a height exceeding 14 inches, I think it refers to the actual height before rounding. So if a poodle is 14.1 inches tall, it's measured as 14 inches, but its actual height exceeds 14. So in that case, the cutoff is 14 inches (not 14.5). So the z-score is 2/1.8 ≈1.1111, and the probability is about 13.35%, which is approximately 13.4%. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended approach is different.

Wait, maybe the options are rounded to the nearest 5%, so 13% would round to 10% or 15%. Option F is 10%, G is 15%. Hmm, which is closer? 13.35 is closer to 13 than to 15, but perhaps the intended answer is 10% or 15%. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is considering the measured (rounded) height. So, if a poodle's measured height is greater than 14 inches, that means it's 15 inches or more in measurement. So the actual height would be 14.5 inches or above. So then, the z-score is (14.5 -12)/1.8 ≈1.3889, as I calculated earlier. The area beyond that is about 0.0823, which is 8.23%. But the options don't have 8%, so the closest is F:10%. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is 5%, but that's option C.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: "find the percentage of poodles having a height exceeding 14 inches." So it's the actual height, not the measured one. So if the actual height is more than 14 inches, regardless of how it's measured. Then the cutoff is 14 inches, and the z-score is 1.1111. The area beyond is about 13.35%, which isn't exactly an option. So perhaps the intended answer is 10%, but that's a rough estimate.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the measured height as the variable, so the possible measured heights are integers. So to find the probability that the measured height is greater than 14 inches. Measured height is an integer, so greater than 14 would be 15, 16, etc. So in that case, the actual height needs to be >=14.5 inches to be measured as 15 inches. So the cutoff is 14.5 inches, leading to a z-score of about 1.39, which gives about 8.2% as before.

But the options don't have 8%, so perhaps the intended answer is 5% (option C) or 10% (F). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should check the z-table more accurately. Let me get the exact value for z=1.39. The standard normal table gives the area to the left. For z=1.38, the area is 0.9162. For z=1.39, it's 0.9177. So the area to the right is 0.0823, or 8.23%.

Looking at the options, the closest is F:10%. But 8.23 is not exactly 10. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to use a continuity correction. Wait, but we've already done that by considering the measured height. So perhaps the intended answer is 5% (option C) or 2.5% (B). Wait, 8% is closer to 10% than to 5%, but perhaps the options are rounded differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again. Maybe the question is using the measured height as a discrete variable, so the possible outcomes are 12,13,14,15,... inches. So to find the probability that the measured height is greater than 14 inches (i.e., 15 inches or more). So the actual height would have to be at least 14.5 inches. So same as before, z=1.39, 8.23%. But the options don't include this.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is treating the data as continuous without considering the rounding. So the cutoff is 14 inches. So z=(14-12)/1.8=1.1111, which gives about 13.35% as before.

Hmm, but the options don't have 13%. So perhaps the intended answer is 10% (F), but that's a bit of a stretch.

Wait, maybe I should look at the empirical rule. For data within one sigma (mean +/- sigma), about 68% of the data lies. Within two sigma, about 95%, and within three sigma, 99.7%. Here, the z-score is about 1.39, which is between 1 and 2 sigma. The area beyond 1 sigma is about 16% on both sides (total 32%), and beyond 1.39 sigma would be less than that. At z=1.28, it's about 10% in the upper tail. Wait, wait, wait. At z=1.28, the area to the left is 0.8997, so area to the right is 0.1003, which is about 10%. So for z=1.28, the upper tail is 10%. But our z is 1.39, which is higher than 1.28, so the upper tail is less than 10%. So the area beyond z=1.39 is about 8.2%, which is less than 10%. So perhaps the intended answer is 5% (option C), but 8.2 is closer to 10%.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to use the empirical rule without precise calculation. So since the z-score is around 1.39, which is between 1 and 2 sigma. Beyond 1 sigma is 16% (approximately; actually, more precisely, it's about 15.87% for z=1). So beyond 1.39 sigma, it's about 8.2%, which isn't exactly an option. So perhaps the intended answer is 5% (C) or 10% (F). But I'm not sure.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C is 5% and option B is 2.5%, which are both lower. 8.2 is closer to 10% than to 5%, so perhaps the intended answer is F:10%. Alternatively, if the question assumes a different approach, maybe rounding off differently.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it differently. Let's compute the exact z-score and see.

Z = (14.5 -12)/1.8 = 2.5 /1.8 ≈1.3889.

Looking up z=1.39 in the standard normal table. The precise value for z=1.39 is 0.9177, so the area beyond is 0.0823, which is 8.23%. So that's roughly 8%. Since the options don't have 8%, perhaps the intended answer is F:10%. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to use the continuity correction differently. Wait, no, I think I've already applied the continuity correction by using 14.5 as the cutoff.

Alternatively, maybe the problem doesn't consider the continuity correction and just uses 14 as the cutoff. Then z=1.1111, which gives about 13.35%. Again, no exact option, but the closest is G:15% or F:10%.

I'm a bit stuck here. But considering the options, perhaps the intended answer is 5% (C) or 10% (F). Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is using a different value, like 14 inches without the continuity correction. So z=1.1111, area beyond is 13.35%. The closest option is F:10% or G:15%. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the z-score for 14.5 inches. 14.5 minus 12 is 2.5. 2.5 divided by 1.8 is approximately 1.3889. Yes, that's correct. So the area beyond is 8.23%. So none of the options match exactly, but perhaps the intended answer is F:10%.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that poodles can't have a height exceeding a certain limit, but that's probably not relevant. Alternatively, maybe the question expects me to use a different approach, like using the empirical rule without exact calculation. For example, if the z-score is about 1.39, which is between 1 and 2 sigma. The empirical rule says that about 2.5% are beyond 2 sigma, and about 16% beyond 1 sigma. So 1.39 is closer to 1.5 sigma, where perhaps the area is around 6.68% beyond. Wait, no, at z=1.5, the area beyond is about 6.68%. So for z=1.39, it's a bit higher, maybe 8%.

But again, the options don't have 8%, so perhaps the intended answer is 5% (C) or 10% (F). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again. The options are:

A:45%, B:2.5%, C:5%, D:30%, E:20%, F:10%, G:15%, H:35%, I:40%, J:25%.

So the closest to 8.2% is F:10%. So the answer is probably F:10%.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects a different approach. Maybe it's using the binomial distribution or something else, but I don't think so. It's a normal distribution question.

Another thought: maybe the question is asking for the percentage exceeding 14 inches in the measured height, which would mean that the poodle's actual height is 14.5 or more. So that's the same as before, leading to 8.23%, which is closest to 10% (F). So I think the intended answer is F:10%.

But wait, looking back, when I did the z-score for 14 inches, I got about 13.35%, which is closer to 15% (G). So perhaps the intended approach was to not use the continuity correction, leading to 13.35% and choosing the closest option, which would be F:10% or G:15%. 13.35 is closer to 13, which is between 10 and 15. So perhaps the intended answer is F:10%.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to round 8.23% to 10%, so F would be the answer.

I think I've thought through all possible angles, and the most likely intended answer is F:10%.

To determine the percentage of miniature poodles with a height exceeding 14 inches, we start by noting that the heights are normally distributed with a mean (μ) of 12 inches and a standard deviation (σ) of 1.8 inches. Since heights are measured to the nearest inch, the problem likely refers to the actual height exceeding 14 inches, which corresponds to a cutoff of 14.5 inches (as anything below 14.5 would round to 14 inches).

### Step 1: Calculate the z-score
The z-score is calculated using the formula:

\[
z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
\]

For \(X = 14.5\), \(\mu = 12\), and \(\sigma = 1.8\):

\[
z = \frac{14.5 - 12}{1.8} = \frac{2.5}{1.8} \approx 1.39
\]

### Step 2: Find the area to the right of \(z = 1.39\)
Using the standard normal distribution table, the area to the left of \(z = 1.39\) is approximately 0
