Okay, so I've got this problem here about mixing salt and water in a tank. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on these mixing problems, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the setup is a thoroughly mixed vessel with salt dissolved in water. Initially, there's 100 pounds of fresh water in the tank. So, no salt to begin with, right? Then, the inlet conditions are given: the water flow rate is 150 lb/hr, and the salt flow rate is 30 lb/hr. The solution leaves at 120 lb/hr. I need to find the outlet concentration after one hour. The options are from A to J, all decimals.

I remember that these kinds of problems often involve mass balances. So, the general approach is to account for the mass entering and leaving the system, and then find out what's left in the tank.

Let me jot down the given data:

- Initial water: 100 lbm (so initial mass of solution is 100 lbm, since no salt)
- Inlet: ṁ_water = 150 lb/hr, ṁ_salt = 30 lb/hr
- Outlet: ṁ_total = 120 lb/hr

Hmm, wait. So the total inlet mass flow rate is 150 + 30 = 180 lb/hr. The outlet is 120 lb/hr. So the tank is either accumulating or losing mass over time. But wait, because the initial mass is 100 lb, and the flows are in and out, I need to calculate how the mass in the tank changes with time.

Wait, no, because initially, the tank has 100 lb of water. Then, when we start adding salt and more water, the mass inside the tank will change. But the question is about the concentration after one hour, so we need to model how the concentration evolves over that time.

Wait, but since the flows are steady, maybe we can model this using a differential equation. Let me think about the mass balance for the salt.

The concentration is mass of salt divided by total mass of solution. Let's denote C(t) as the concentration at time t. The mass of salt in the tank at time t would be C(t) multiplied by the total mass in the tank at that time, which I'll call M(t).

So, the change in salt mass over time is equal to the rate at which salt enters minus the rate at which it leaves.

The rate of salt entering is given by the inlet salt flow, which is 30 lb/hr. The rate leaving depends on the concentration, because the solution leaving carries salt with it. So the outlet salt flow is C(t) multiplied by the outlet mass flow rate, which is 120 lb/hr.

So the differential equation would be:

d/dt (M(t) * C(t)) = ṁ_s - ṁ_total_out * C(t)

Wait, but M(t) is the total mass in the tank at time t. Let me think about M(t). The total mass entering per hour is (150 +30)=180 lb/hr. The mass leaving is 120 lb/hr. So the change in mass of the tank is 180 - 120 = 60 lb/hr. So M(t) = initial mass + (ṁ_in - ṁ_out) * t.

Initial mass is 100 lb (water only). So after t hours, M(t) = 100 + (180 - 120) * t = 100 + 60 t.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check that. The initial mass is 100 lb. Every hour, the net mass added is 60 lb. So yes, M(t) = 100 + 60 t.

But wait, the question is about after one hour, so t=1. M(1) = 100 + 60*1 = 160 lb.

Ok, so now back to the salt balance. The rate of change of salt mass is:

d/dt (M(t) C(t)) = ṁ_salt_in - ṁ_salt_out.

ṁ_salt_in is 30 lb/hr. ṁ_salt_out is C(t) * ṁ_total_out, which is 120 lb/hr * C(t).

So, putting it together:

d(MC)/dt = 30 - 120 C(t)

But M(t) is 100 +60 t. So,

dC/dt * M(t) + C(t) * dM/dt = 30 - 120 C(t)

Wait, because M(t) is a function of time, when we take the derivative of M*C, it's M*dC/dt + C*dM/dt.

So,

M(t) dC/dt + C(t) * dM/dt = 30 - 120 C(t)

We can substitute dM/dt, which is 60 lb/hr.

So,

(100 +60t) dC/dt + 60 C(t) = 30 -120 C(t)

Hmm, this looks like a linear differential equation. Let me rearrange it.

(100 +60t) dC/dt = 30 -120 C(t) -60 C(t)
= 30 - 180 C(t)

So,

dC/dt = [30 -180 C(t)] / (100 +60t)

This equation can be written as:

dC/dt + [180 / (100 +60t)] C(t) = 30 / (100 +60t)

This is a linear ODE of the form dy/dt + P(t) y = Q(t).

The integrating factor (IF) would be exp( ∫ P(t) dt )

Here, P(t) = 180/(100+60t) = (180)/(100 +60t).

Let me compute the integral of P(t) dt.

Let u = 100 +60t → du =60 dt → dt = du/60.

So,

∫ [180/u ] * (du/60) = (180/60) ∫ (1/u) du = 3 ∫ (1/u) du = 3 ln|u| + C.

So, IF = exp(3 ln(100 +60t)) )= (100 +60t)^3.

So, the solution is:

C(t) * IF = ∫ [30/(100+60t)] * IF dt + constant

Wait, let me write the standard solution form. For a linear ODE:

y = (1/IF) [ ∫ (Q(t) IF) dt + C ]

In our case, Q(t) = 30/(100+60t)

So,

C(t) = [ ∫ (30/(100+60t)) * (100+60t)^3 dt + C ] / (100 +60t)^3 )

Let me compute the integral in the numerator.

∫ [30/(100+60t)] * (100+60t)^3 dt

Simplify inside the integral:

(100+60t)^3 * 30/(100+60t) )= 30 (100+60t)^2

So, integral becomes ∫30 (100+60t)^2 dt.

Let me compute that. Let me expand (100 +60t)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*60 t + (60t)^2 = 10,000 + 12,000 t + 3,600 t^2.

So,

∫30 [10,000 + 12,000 t + 3,600 t^2 ] dt

= 30 [ 10,000 t + 6,000 t² + 1,200 t^3 ] + C

= 300,000 t + 180,000 t² + 36,000 t^3 + C.

So, putting it all back:

C(t) = [ 300,000 t + 180,000 t² + 36,000 t^3 + C ] / (100 +60t)^3

Now, we need to determine the constant C using the initial condition. At t=0, the concentration C(0) is 0, because initially, the tank has only water, no salt.

So substituting t=0 into the equation:

C(0) = [0 +0 +0 + C ] / (100)^3 = C/(1,000,000) = 0 → so C=0.

Hmm, wait, that can't be right because that would make C(t) = [300,000 t + ... ] / (100+60t)^3.

Wait, but let me think again. The initial condition is at t=0, the mass of salt is zero. So, when t=0, the solution is M=100 lb, with C=0.

So yes, initial condition C(0)=0.

So the equation becomes:

C(t) = [300,000 t + 180,000 t^2 + 36,000 t^3 ] / (100 +60t)^3.

Hmm, let's factor numerator and denominator.

Wait, let me factor the numerator:

300,000 t + 180,000 t² +36,000 t^3 = 300,000 t (1) + 180,000 t^2 +36,000 t^3.

Wait, let me factor 60 t:

Wait, 60t is a common term in each term, perhaps. Let me see.

Wait, 300,000 = 5*60,000 → 5*60,000 t.

Wait, perhaps I can factor 60 t out.

Wait:

300,000 t = 60,000 *5 t,

180,000 t² = 60,000 *3 t²,

36,000 t^3 = 60,000 *0.6 t^3.

Wait, perhaps that's not helpful. Maybe factor 60,000 t.

300,000 t = 60,000 *5 t,

180,000 t² = 60,000 *3 t²,

36,000 t^3 = 60,000 *0.6 t^3.

So,

Numerator = 60,000 t (5 + 3 t + 0.6 t² )

Denominator = (100 +60t)^3.

Hmm, let me write denominator as (100 +60t)^3.

Alternatively, perhaps we can factor 20 from denominator.

100 +60t = 20*(5) + 20*3 t = 20(5 +3t).

So 100 + 60t = 20(5 +3t), so denominator is [20(5+3t)]^3 = 8000 (5+3t)^3.

Ok, so denominator = 8000 (5+3t)^3.

Now, the numerator:

60,000 t (5 +3t +0.6 t²) → Wait, let me compute 5 +3t +0.6t².

Wait, 0.6 t² is 3/5 t².

Wait, perhaps the numerator can be expressed in terms of (5 +3t) as a factor.

Wait, perhaps the quadratic 0.6 t^2 +3 t +5 can be related to the denominator's (5+3t) in some way.

Let me compute 0.6 t^2 +3t +5.

Wait, 0.6 t^2 +3t +5 = 0.6 t^2 +3 t +5.

Hmm, maybe factor it:

Wait, 0.6 t^2 +3t +5 = 0.6 (t^2 +5 t) +5.

Not sure if it factors neatly. Alternatively, compute the roots.

But perhaps not necessary. Let's proceed.

So numerator: 60,000 t (0.6 t² +3 t +5 )

Denominator: 8000 (5 +3t)^3

So,

C(t) = [60,000 t (0.6 t² +3t +5) ] / [8000 (5+3t)^3 ]

Simplify the constants:

60,000 / 8000 = 7.5.

So,

C(t) = 7.5 t (0.6 t² +3t +5) / (5+3t)^3.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor 5+3t from the numerator.

Wait, let's see. Let me compute 5+3t.

Let me see if 5+3t is a factor of 0.6 t² +3t +5.

Wait, let me perform polynomial division.

Divide 0.6 t² +3 t +5 by (3t +5).

Wait, 3t +5 → let me write it as 3t +5.

Let me write 0.6 t^2 +3 t +5 divided by 3t +5.

Hmm, let's see:

(3t +5) ) 0.6 t^2 +3 t +5

First term: 0.6 t^2 / 3t → 0.2 t.

Multiply (3t +5) by 0.2 t → 0.6 t^2 + t.

Subtract from the original:

(0.6 t^2 +3 t +5) - (0.6 t^2 +t ) → 2t +5.

Now, divide 2t +5 by 3t +5 → next term is 2/3.

Multiply (3t+5) by 2/3 → 2t + 10/3.

Subtract: (2t +5) - (2t +10/3 )= 5 -10/3 =5/3.

So, 0.6 t^2 +3 t +5 = (3t +5)(0.2 t + 2/3) +5/3.

Hmm, not a clean division. So the numerator inside the parentheses doesn't factor neatly with (3t +5).

Maybe I should proceed with plugging t=1 into the equation.

Because the question asks for the concentration after one hour, which is t=1.

So, t=1.

So, let's compute C(1):

C(1) = 7.5 *1* (0.6*(1)^2 +3*1 +5) / (5 +3*1)^3.

Compute numerator and denominator step by step.

First, numerator inside the brackets:

0.6*(1)^2 +3*1 +5 = 0.6 +3 +5 = 8.6.

Denominator inside the brackets:

(5+3*1)^3 = (8)^3 =512.

So,

C(1)= 7.5 *8.6 /512.

Let me compute 7.5 *8.6.

7.5 *8 =60, 7.5 *0.6 =4.5 → total 64.5.

So,

C(1)= 64.5 /512 = ?

Let me compute that.

64.5 /512 ≈ 0.1259.

Wait, that's approximately 0.126. Hmm, looking at the options, the closest value would be 0.16, but that's option D, which is 0.16. But wait, 0.126 is closer to 0.13. Hmm, but none of the options match exactly.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in my calculations.

Let me recheck the steps.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the differential equation setup.

Let me go back. The mass balance for salt is:

The rate of change of salt in the tank is the salt coming in minus the salt going out.

So,

d(M*C)/dt = ṁ_salt_in - ṁ_salt_out.

ṁ_salt_in is 30 lb/hr.

ṁ_salt_out is C(t) * ṁ_total_out, which is 120 lb/hr.

So the equation is correct.

Then, M(t) is 100 +60t.

So, M(t) =100 +60t.

Then, the ODE is correct: (100+60t) dC/dt +60 C =30 -120 C.

So,

(100+60t) dC/dt =30 -180 C.

Then,

dC/dt = (30 -180 C)/(100+60t).

Yes, that's correct.

Then, I rewrote this as a linear ODE:

dC/dt + [180/(100+60t)] C = 30/(100+60t).

Yes, that's correct.

Then, integrating factor is exp( ∫ 180/(100+60t) dt ).

Let me recompute that integral.

Integral of 180/(100+60t) dt.

Let u=100+60t → du=60 dt → dt=du/60.

So,

∫ 180/u * (du/60) = (180/60) ∫ (1/u) du =3 ln|u| + C.

So, integrating factor is e^{3 ln(u)} }= u^3 = (100+60t)^3.

So, correct.

Then, the solution is:

C(t) = [ ∫ (30/(100+60t)) * (100+60t)^3 dt + C ] / (100+60t)^3.

Compute the integral:

30/(100+60t) * (100+60t)^3 = 30*(100+60t)^2.

Which becomes 30*(100^2 + 12000 t + 3600 t^2 ) = 30*(10,000 +12,000 t +3,600 t² )

Wait, but earlier I think I made a mistake in the expansion.

Wait, (100 +60t)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*60 t + (60t)^2 = 10,000 + 12,000 t + 3,600 t².

Yes, that's correct.

So, 30*(10,000 +12,000 t +3,600 t² )= 300,000 + 360,000 t +108,000 t².

Wait, wait a minute, earlier I wrote 300,000 t + 180,000 t²..., which must have been a mistake.

Wait, no, wait. Let me recompute the integral correctly.

The integral of 30*(100+60t)^2 dt is:

30 ∫ (100 +60t)^2 dt.

Let me expand (100 +60t)^2:

= 100^2 + 2*100*60 t + (60t)^2
= 10,000 + 12,000 t + 3,600 t^2.

So,

30 ∫ (10,000 +12,000 t +3,600 t^2 ) dt.

Integrate term by term:

=30 [10,000 t + 6,000 t^2 + 1,200 t^3 ] + C.

Wait, because ∫10,000 dt=10,000 t,

∫12,000 t dt=6,000 t^2,

∫3,600 t^2 dt=1,200 t
