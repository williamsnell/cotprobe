Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about sound, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: A sound with a frequency of 1,000 cycles per second is produced when the air temperature is 15 degrees Celsius. I need to find the wavelength of this sound, and choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that the speed of sound in air depends on the temperature. Oh right, the formula for the speed of sound in air is something like v = 331 + (0.6 * T), where T is in Celsius. Wait, was that right? Or was it 331 plus 0.6 times the temperature? I think that's correct because as temperature increases, the speed increases. So at 0 degrees Celsius, the speed is about 331 m/s.

So the temperature here is 15°C. Let me calculate the speed first. Using the formula, v = 331 + (0.6 * 15). Let's compute that. 0.6 times 15 is 9. So 331 + 9 = 340 m/s. So the speed of sound is 340 meters per second at 15°C.

Wait, but wait, I think another version of the formula is v = 331.3 m/s at 0°C, and it increases by approximately 0.6 m/s per degree Celsius. So yes, that seems right.

Now, the frequency is given as 1,000 cycles per second, which is 1,000 Hz. I need to find the wavelength. Oh, right, the formula that relates speed, frequency, and wavelength is v = f * λ. So λ (lambda) is v divided by f.

So λ = v / f. Let me plug in the numbers. v is 340 m/s, f is 1,000 Hz. So 340 / 1000 = 0.34 meters per cycle. Wait, but the options are in feet per cycle. Oh right, I need to convert meters to feet.

I remember that 1 meter is approximately 3.28084 feet. So 0.34 meters is 0.34 * 3.28084 feet. Let me calculate that. 0.34 * 3 is 1.02, and 0.34 * 0.28084 is about 0.095. So adding those together, 1.02 + 0.095 is approximately 1.115 feet per cycle. Wait, let me be more precise.

Wait, 3.28084 * 0.34. Let me compute this accurately. 3.28084 * 0.3 is 0.984252. 3.28084 * 0.04 is 0.1312336. So adding them: 0.984252 + 0.1312336 = 1.1154856 feet. So approximately 1.115 feet per cycle.

Looking at the options, let me check each one.

Option J is 1.12 ft/cycle. That's very close to my calculation of about 1.115. So option J is 1.12, which matches. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, another thought: sometimes the speed of sound formula is given as 331 m/s at 0°C, plus 0.6 per degree Celsius. So 15°C would add 9, making 340 m/s. Yes.

Frequency is 1000, so wavelength λ = 340 / 1000 = 0.34 m. Convert that to feet: 0.34 * 3.28084.

Wait, maybe I should compute 0.34 * 3.28084 more accurately.

3.28084 * 0.3 is 0.984252.

3.28084 * 0.04 is 0.1312336.

Adding them: 0.984252 + 0.1312336 = 1.1154856, so approximately 1.1155 feet. Rounding to two decimal places would be 1.12, which is option J.

Wait, but another thing: sometimes the conversion factor is approximated as 3.281 feet per meter, so maybe the exact value is a bit different. Let me compute 0.34 * 3.281.

0.3 * 3.281 = 0.9843.

0.04 * 3.281 = 0.13124.

Adding them: 0.9843 + 0.13124 = 1.11554, which is 1.1155, so 1.12 when rounded to two decimal places.

So the answer should be J:1.12 ft/cycle.

Wait, but let me look at the options again. Are there any options close to 1.12? Let me check:

Option J is 1.12 ft/cycle.

Yes, so that's the correct one.

To determine the wavelength of the sound, we start by calculating the speed of sound in air at 15°C. The formula for the speed of sound is:

\[
v = 331 + (0.6 \cdot T)
\]

where \( T \) is the temperature in Celsius. Substituting \( T = 15 \):

\[
v = 331 + (0.6 \cdot 15) = 331 + 9 = 340 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

Next, we use the relationship between speed (\( v \)), frequency (\( f \)), and wavelength (\( \lambda \)):

\[
v = f \cdot \lambda \quad \Rightarrow \quad \lambda = \frac{v}{f}.
\]

The frequency is given as \( f = 1000 \, \text{Hz} \), so:

\[
\lambda = \frac{340}{1000} = 0.34 \, \text{m/cycle}.
\]

To convert meters to feet, we use the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{m} = 3.28084 \, \text{ft} \):

\[
\lambda = 0.34 \cdot 3.28084 \approx 1.115 \, \text{ft/cycle}.
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, \( \lambda \approx 1.12 \, \text{ft/cycle} \).

From the given options, the closest match is:

**J: 1.12 ft/cycle.**
