Okay, so I need to figure out the effective rate for an 18% annual interest rate that's compounded quarterly. Hmm, I remember that compound interest means that the interest is calculated and added to the principal multiple times over the periods. Since it's compounded quarterly, that means four times a year.

Wait, the question is about the effective rate, which I think is the equivalent annual rate when compounding is considered. Oh right, the effective annual rate (EAR) formula comes into play here. The formula, if I recall, is something like (1 + (r/n))^n - 1, where r is the annual rate and n is the number of compounding periods.

So given that the annual rate is 18%, that's 0.18 in decimal. And n is 4 because it's quarterly. Plugging these into the formula, it should be (1 + 0.18/4)^4 - 1.

Let me compute that step by step. First, 0.18 divided by 4 is 0.045. So each quarter, the interest rate applied is 4.5%. Then I add 1 to that, making it 1.045. Now I need to raise this to the power of 4 because there are four quarters in a year.

Calculating 1.045^4. Hmm, I might need to do this multiplication manually or approximate it. Let me try expanding it.

1.045 * 1.045 is... let's see, 1.045 squared. 1.045 * 1.045. Let me calculate that. 1 * 1 is 1, 1 * 0.045 is 0.045, 0.045 * 1 is another 0.045, and 0.045 * 0.045 is 0.002025. Adding those together: 1 + 0.045 + 0.045 + 0.002025 equals 1.092025. So 1.045 squared is 1.092025.

Now I need to square that result again because it's to the fourth power. So 1.092025 multiplied by itself. Let's compute that. 

1.092025 * 1.092025. Breaking it down:

First, 1 * 1.092025 = 1.092025.
Then 0.092025 * 1.092025. Wait, maybe it's easier to do it as (1.09 + 0.002025)^2. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, I can multiply step by step.

Alternatively, maybe I can approximate. I know that (1.092025)^2 is approximately 1.092025 * 1.092025. Let me compute 1.092 * 1.092.

1.092 * 1.092: 1*1 is 1, 1*0.092 is 0.092, 0.092*1 is another 0.092, and 0.092 * 0.092 is about 0.008464. Adding those: 1 + 0.092 + 0.092 + 0.008464 = 1.192464. But wait, that's for 1.092 squared. But our number is 1.092025, so the square might be a little higher, maybe around 1.1925 or so.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b². Let a be 1.09 and b be 0.002025. Then (1.09 + 0.002025)^2 = (1.09)^2 + 2*(1.09)*(0.002025) + (0.002025)^2.

Calculating each part:

1.09 squared is 1.1881.

The middle term: 2 * 1.09 * 0.002025. Let's compute 2 * 1.09 = 2.18, multiplied by 0.002025. 2.18 * 0.002 is 0.00436, and 2.18 * 0.000025 is 0.0000545. Adding those gives approx 0.0044145.

The last term is (0.002025)^2 = about 0.0000041006.

Adding all three parts: 1.1881 + 0.0044145 = 1.1925145, plus 0.0000041 gives roughly 1.1925186.

So 1.092025 squared is approximately 1.1925. Therefore, (1.045)^4 is about 1.1925. Wait, no, wait. Wait, (1.045)^4 is (1.045^2)^2, which is (1.092025)^2, which we just calculated as approximately 1.1925.

So then, (1 + 0.18/4)^4 is about 1.1925. Therefore, the effective rate is 1.1925 - 1 = 0.1925, which is 19.25%.

Wait, but looking at the options, option G is 0.1925. So that would be the answer. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes these compounding rates can be tricky.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute 1.045^4 exactly. Let's try using a calculator approach:

First, 1.045^1 = 1.045
1.045^2 = 1.045 * 1.045 = 1.092025
1.045^3 = 1.092025 * 1.045. Let me compute that.

1.092025 * 1.045:
Multiply 1.092025 by 1.04 (which is 1 + 0.04) and then add 0.005 * 1.092025.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to do it step by step.

1.092025 * 1.045 = ?

Let me calculate:

1.092025 * 1 = 1.092025
1.092025 * 0.04 = 0.04368099
1.092025 * 0.005 = 0.005460125

Adding these together: 1.092025 + 0.04368099 = 1.13570599, plus 0.005460125 gives 1.141166115.

So 1.045^3 is approximately 1.141166.

Now, for 1.045^4, multiply 1.141166 by 1.045.

1.141166 * 1.045:

Let me break it down again.

1.141166 * 1 = 1.141166
1.141166 * 0.04 = 0.04564664
1.141166 * 0.005 = 0.00570583

Adding them together: 1.141166 + 0.04564664 = 1.18681264 + 0.00570583 = 1.19251847.

So 1.045^4 is approximately 1.19251847. Subtracting 1 gives the effective rate: 0.19251847, which is about 0.1925 or 19.25%.

Looking back at the options, option G is 0.1925. So the correct answer should be G.

To determine the effective annual rate (EAR) for an 18% annual interest rate compounded quarterly, we use the formula:

\[
EAR = \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^n - 1
\]

Where:
- \( r = 0.18 \) (the annual interest rate),
- \( n = 4 \) (the number of compounding periods per year).

### Step 1: Calculate the quarterly interest rate
\[
\frac{r}{n} = \frac{0.18}{4} = 0.045
\]

### Step 2: Raise \( 1 + \frac{r}{n} \) to the power of \( n \)
\[
\left(1 + 0.045\right)^4 = 1.045^4
\]

Breaking this down:
- \( 1.045^2 = 1.045 \times 1.045 = 1.092025 \),
- \( 1.092025^2 = 1.092025 \times 1.092025 \approx 1.19251847 \).

Thus:
\[
1.045^4 \approx 1.19251847
\]

### Step 3: Subtract 1 to find the effective rate
\[
EAR = 1.19251847 - 1 = 0.19251847
\]

This simplifies to approximately \( 0.1925 \), or 19.25%.

### Final Answer:
The effective annual rate is **0.1925**, which corresponds to option **G**.
