Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a snowball melting when it hits a tree. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking for the speed at which the snowball must travel so that it melts on impact, right?

Alright, I remember that when something is thrown and hits a surface, its kinetic energy is converted into other forms. Since there's no frictional heat loss, I guess all the kinetic energy goes into melting the snowball. Oh wait, but the snowball is at -15°C, so it's below freezing. That means before it can melt, it needs to first reach 0°C. Oh right, so I need to account for the heat required to raise its temperature to melting point and then the heat to actually melt it.

Wait, wait. So the total energy needed is the sum of two parts: the heat to warm the ice from -15 to 0°C, and then the heat of fusion to melt it.

The specific heat capacity of ice... I think it's around 0.5 cal/g°C or something like that. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. Specific heat capacity (c) for ice is about 0.5 cal/(g·°C). And the specific heat of fusion (L) for ice is given as 79.7 cal/g. Right.

So the kinetic energy (KE) from the snowball's motion must equal the sum of the heat needed to raise the temperature and the heat to melt it. So KE = Q1 + Q2, where Q1 is the heat to warm it up and Q2 is the heat of fusion.

But wait, how do I relate the kinetic energy to that? Kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². But the problem doesn't give me the mass of the snowball. Hmm, maybe the mass cancels out somehow. Let me think.

So the equation would be:
(1/2)mv² = m * c * ΔT + m * L
Oh, right! Because Q1 is m*c*ΔT and Q2 is m*L. So when I factor out the mass, it cancels on both sides. So mass doesn't matter here, which is convenient because it's not given.

So then I can write:
(1/2)v² = c * ΔT + L
Wait, but wait, since the units might be a bit tricky. Let's check the units.

c is in cal/(g·°C), ΔT is °C, so c*ΔT is cal/g. L is also cal/g. So the right side is cal/g. The left side is (m/s)^2. Hmm, but I need to convert units so that they match.

Wait, the kinetic energy is in joules usually, but here we're in calories. Let me think about unit conversions.

I know that 1 calorie is approximately 4.184 joules. But wait, the specific heat and fusion are given in cal, so perhaps I should work in those units.

Wait, but (1/2)v² is in (m²/s²), which is (J/kg) when multiplied by mass. Wait, no, the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², which is in joules (kg·m²/s²). But in this problem, the heat terms are in calories per gram. So maybe it's better to convert the kinetic energy into calories per gram.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute everything in SI units. Let me think.

Wait, let's see. Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the heat required to bring the ice from -15°C to 0°C.
2. Add the heat required to melt the ice at 0°C.
3. This total heat must equal the kinetic energy from the snowball's impact.
4. Solve for the velocity.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, find Q1 = m * c * ΔT. c is 0.5 cal/(g·°C), ΔT is 15°C (from -15 to 0). So Q1 = m * 0.5 * 15 = 7.5 m cal.

Wait, but m is in grams, so the unit is cal. Wait, 0.5 cal/g°C * 15°C * m grams gives (0.5 *15) * m cal = 7.5 m cal.

Then Q2 = m * L = m * 79.7 cal.

So total heat Q = Q1 + Q2 = m*(7.5 +79.7) = m*87.2 cal.

The kinetic energy KE is (1/2)mv². So set KE = Q_total:

(1/2)mv² = m *87.2 cal.

We can cancel mass m from both sides:

(1/2)v² =87.2 cal/g.

Wait, but wait, units don't match. Because the left side is in m²/s², and the right is in cal/g. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should express everything in consistent units. Let me think in terms of grams and centimeters, since calories are involved.

Wait, alternative approach: Let's express the kinetic energy in terms of cal and grams. Because 1 cal = 4.184 J, and 1 J = 1 kg·m²/s².

But perhaps it's easier to use the fact that 1 cal = 4.184 J, and 1 J = 10^7 ergs, but wait, maybe I'm complicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the conversion factor between calories and joules, and meters and centimeters.

Wait, another approach: Let me express everything in SI units.

c (specific heat) of ice is 2100 J/(kg·°C) because 0.5 cal/(g·°C) is equal to 0.5 * 4184 J/(kg·°C) = 2092 J/(kg·°C). Let me make sure.

Wait, 1 cal = 4.184 J, so 0.5 cal = 2.092 J. So 0.5 cal/(g·°C) is 2.092 J/(g·°C). But since 1 kg = 1000 g, 2.092 J/(g·°C) is 2092 J/(kg·°C). So c = 2092 J/(kg·°C).

Similarly, the latent heat of fusion L is 79.7 cal/g. Converting to J/kg: 79.7 cal/g * 4.184 J/cal * 1000 g/kg = 79.7 *4184 *10^3 /10^3 (since grams to kg is *1000). So 79.7 *4184 = let's compute that.

Wait, 79.7 * 4184. Let me compute that:

Compute 80 *4184 = 334,720. But 79.7 is 80 -0.3, so 79.7 *4184 = 334720 - (0.3*4184) = 334720 - 1255.2 = 333,464.8 J/kg. So L = 333,464.8 J/kg.

Now, the temperature change is from -15°C to 0°C, so ΔT =15°C.

So the heat required per kg is:

Q1 = c * ΔT = 2092 J/(kg·°C) *15°C = 31,380 J/kg.

Q2 = L =333,464.8 J/kg.

So total heat per kg is 31,380 +333,464.8 = 364,844.8 J/kg.

Kinetic energy (KE) per kg is (1/2)v².

So,

(1/2)v² = 364,844.8 J/kg

Multiply both sides by 2:

v² = 729,689.6

Take square root:

v = sqrt(729,689.6) ≈ let's calculate that.

What is sqrt(729,689.6)?

Well, 850 squared is 722,500, because 850^2 = (800+50)^2 = 800^2 + 2*800*50 +50^2 = 640000 + 80000 +2500= 722,500.

900^2 is 810,000. So our value is 729,689.6, which is between 850^2 and 900^2.

Compute 854^2: 854 *854.

Let me compute 850^2 =722500.

Then 854^2 = (850 +4)^2 = 850^2 + 2*850*4 +4^2 =722500 + 6800 +16= 729,316.

Hmm, our value is 729,689.6. So 854^2 is 729,316. The difference is 729,689.6 -729,316 = 373.6.

So 854 + x, where x is the additional amount beyond 854.

(854 +x)^2 ≈ 854^2 + 2*854*x.

Set this equal to 729,689.6.

So 729,316 + 2*854*x =729,689.6.

So 2*854*x = 373.6 → 1708 x = 373.6 → x = 373.6 /1708 ≈ 0.2186.

So x≈0.2186. So v≈854.2186 m/s. Approximately 854 m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is 853 m/s, which is very close. Could I have made a rounding error?

Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, the initial equation was (1/2) v² = 364,844.8 J/kg.

So v² = 729,689.6 → v = sqrt(729,689.6) ≈ 854.22 m/s.

But the options are:

F:853 m/s

E:892

Hmm, 854 is close to 853. So perhaps the intended answer is F) 853 m/s.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the specific heat or the latent heat conversion.

Wait, let me double-check the conversion from cal/g to J/kg.

Specific heat of ice, c_ice = 0.5 cal/(g·°C) = 0.5 * 4.184 J/cal * (1 cal/g) → 0.5 *4.184 *1000 J/kg·°C, because 1 g is 0.001 kg, so to get J per kg, we multiply by 1000.

So 0.5 cal/(g·°C) is 0.5 *4.184 *1000 = 2092 J/(kg·°C). That seems correct.

Latent heat L is 79.7 cal/g. So 79.7 cal/g *4.184 J/cal *1000 g/kg =79.7 *4184 *10 (because 1000 g/kg, and 79.7 cal/g is per gram, so per kg it's *1000). Wait, no:

Wait, 79.7 cal/g → per kg, it's 79.7 cal/g * 1000 g/kg =79,700 cal/kg.

Then convert cal to J: 79,700 cal/kg *4.184 J/cal = 79,700 *4.184.

Let me compute that: 79,700 *4 = 318,800; 79,700 *0.184= ?

Compute 79,700 *0.1=7,970; 79,700 *0.08=6,376; 79,700 *0.004=318.8.

So 7,970 +6,376=14,346 +318.8=14,664.8.

So total is 318,800 +14,664.8=333,464.8 J/kg. So that's correct.

So the total heat per kg is 31,380 +333,464.8= 364,844.8 J/kg.

So (1/2)v²=364,844.8 → v²=729,689.6 → v≈854.22 m/s.

Looking at the options, the closest one is F:853 m/s. So I think that's the intended answer.

Wait but let me check if there's any miscalculation in the way I computed the square root.

Another approach: 854^2 is 729,316, as I had before. Our target is 729,689.6.

So the difference is 729,689.6 -729,316 = 373.6.

So since 2*854*x ≈373.6 → x≈373.6/(2*854)= 373.6/1708≈0.2186.

So 854.2186 m/s. So approximately 854.22 m/s.

So the options don't have 854, but F is 853, which is very close. So perhaps the calculation is intended to round to the nearest whole number.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the specific heat value. Wait, maybe I should double-check the specific heat of ice.

Wait, specific heat capacity of ice is indeed about 2.09 J/g°C, which is 0.5 cal/g°C because 2.09 J/g°C = 0.5 cal/g°C (since 1 cal≈4.184 J, so 2.09/4.184≈0.5).

So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses different values for specific heat or latent heat.

Wait, the problem says the specific heat of fusion is 79.7 cal/g. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the square root more precisely.

Compute sqrt(729,689.6):

We know that 854^2=729,316.

854.2^2 = (854 +0.2)^2 =854^2 +2*854*0.2 +0.2^2=729316 +341.6 +0.04=729657.64.

Which is 729,657.64. Our target is 729,689.6. So the difference is 729,689.6 -729,657.64=31.96.

So 854.2^2=729,657.64 → need an additional 31.96.

The next term would be 2*854.2 *x +x^2 =31.96.

Assume x is small, so x^2 is negligible.

So 2*854.2 *x ≈31.96 → x≈31.96/(2*854.2)=31.96/1708.4≈0.0187.

So total v≈854.2 +0.0187=854.2187 m/s.

So about 854.22 m/s. So the closest option is F:853 m/s, but it's 1.22 m/s lower. Hmm, perhaps the options rounded or used approximate values.

Wait, looking back at the options: the options are A:925, B:1100, C:720, D:950, E:892, F:853, G:1002, H:810, I:675, J:763.

So F is 853, which is the closest to 854.22.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, another approach: Maybe I should have considered the heat in calories without converting to SI units.

Let me try that approach. Let's see.

The kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². I need to equate that to the heat, which is in calories.

So, (1/2)mv² = m*c_water*(T_final - T_initial) + m*L.

Wait, but c_water is for liquid, but the snowball is ice. So c_ice is 0.5 cal/(g°C).

So,

(1/2)v² = c_ice * ΔT + L.

Because the mass cancels.

So, (1/2)v² = (0.5 cal/g°C)(15°C) +79.7 cal/g.

Calculate each term:

0.5 *15 =7.5 cal/g.

So total: 7.5 +79.7=87.2 cal/g.

So (1/2)v²=87.2 cal/g.

But wait, 1 cal =4.184 J, and 1 J=1 kg·m²/s².

But we need to convert cal/g to J/kg.

Wait, 1 cal/g is 4184 J/kg. Because 1 cal=4.184 J, and 1 g=0.001 kg, so 1 cal/g =4.184 J /0.001 kg=4184 J/kg.

So 87.2 cal/g =87.2 *4184 J/kg.

Wait, that's a huge number. Wait, 87.2 cal/g is per gram. So per kg, it's 87.2 *4184 J/kg.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, (1/2)v² is in J/kg, since it's (kg·m²/s²)/kg = m²/s².

So, 87.2 cal/g is equal to 87.2 *4184 J/kg.

Because 1 cal=4.184 J, and 1 g=0.001 kg. So 1 cal/g =4.184 J /0.001 kg =4184 J/kg.

So 87.2 cal/g =87.2 *4184 J/kg.

Compute that: 87.2 *4184.

Let me compute 80 *4184 = 334,720.

7.2 *4184 = let's compute 7 *4184=29,288; 0.2 *4184=836.8. So 29,288 +836.8=30,124.8.

So total is 334,720 +30,124.8=364,844.8 J/kg.

So (1/2)v²=364,844.8 → v²=729,689.6 → v=854.22 m/s.

Same result as before. So the calculation is correct.

So the answer should be approximately 854 m/s, but the closest option is F:853 m/s.

Wait, but looking back at the options, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial steps. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using c=1 cal/g°C instead of 0.5.

Wait, wait, no, the specific heat of ice is definitely around 0.5 cal/g°C. So that part was correct.

Wait, maybe the specific heat of fusion is per kg? No, the problem states it's 79.7 cal/g.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the specific heat in a different way.

Wait, another thought: The snowball is at -15°C, so when it hits, it warms up to 0°C, and then melts. So the heat required is
