Okay, so I've got this problem here about George and Richard Martin, who are partners in a law firm. They're paying $6300 a year in rent, and when their lease expires, the new rent is going to be $715 per month. The question is asking what percent increase they'll be facing. The options are from A to J, with various percentages.

Hmm, alright, let's break this down. First, I think I need to find out what their current annual rent is and compare it to the new annual rent to see the increase. Then, I can calculate the percentage increase based on that.

Wait, wait. The current rent is given as $6300 annually, right? But the new rent is $715 per month. So I need to convert that monthly rent into an annual figure to make it comparable. Oh right, because comparing annual to monthly wouldn't make sense otherwise.

So, the new rent is $715 each month. To find the annual amount, I multiply that by 12 months. Let me do that calculation. 715 times 12. Let's see, 700 times 12 is 8400, and 15 times 12 is 180, so adding those together gives 8580. So the new annual rent is $8580.

Now, the current rent is $6300, and the new is $8580. I need to find the increase in dollars first. So, subtract the old from the new: 8580 minus 6300. Let me calculate that. 8580 minus 6000 is 2580, then minus another 300 is 2280. So the increase is $2280.

Wait, wait, let me check that subtraction again. 8580 minus 6300. Maybe it's easier to write it out:

8580  
-6300  
------  
2280

Yes, that's correct. So the increase is $2280.

Now, to find the percentage increase, I think the formula is (Increase / Original) * 100. So, in this case, the original amount is $6300. So the calculation would be 2280 divided by 6300, times 100.

Let me compute 2280 divided by 6300. Hmm. Let's see, 6300 times 0.3 is 1890, and 0.36 times 6300 is, let me calculate: 6300 * 0.36. 6300 * 0.3 is 1890, 6300 * 0.06 is 378, so 1890 + 378 is 2268. Oh wait, that's 0.36 times 6300, which is 2268, which is very close to 2280.

So, 0.36 is 36%, right? But wait, 2280 is a bit more than 2268. Let me calculate the exact value. 2280 divided by 6300.

Well, 2280 รท 6300. Let's simplify this fraction. Both numbers are divisible by 10, so that becomes 228/630. Then, maybe divide numerator and denominator by 3: 228 รท3=76, 630 รท3=210. So 76/210.

Hmm, can I simplify more? 76 and 210. Let's see, 76 is 4*19, 210 is 10*21, so no common factors beyond that. So 76/210 is approximately 0.3619.

Converting that to a percentage, it's about 36.19%. So that's roughly a 36.19% increase.

Looking back at the options, option J is 36%. So the closest answer is J: 36%.

Wait, but let me make sure I did everything correctly. Let me double-check the numbers.

Old rent: $6300/year. New rent: $715/month. So 715 * 12 = 8580. 8580 - 6300 = 2280. 2280 /6300 = 0.3619, which is approximately 36.19%. So the percentage increase is around 36%, which is option J.

I think that's correct. So the answer should be J.

To determine the percentage increase in rent, first convert the new monthly rent to an annual figure. The new rent is **$715 per month**, so the annual rent is:

\[
715 \times 12 = 8580 \, \text{dollars}.
\]

The current annual rent is **$6300**, and the new annual rent is **$8580**. The increase in rent is:

\[
8580 - 6300 = 2280 \, \text{dollars}.
\]

The percentage increase is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Increase}}{\text{Original}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2280}{6300} \right) \times 100.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\frac{2280}{6300} \approx 0.3619 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 0.3619 \times 100 \approx 36.19\%.
\]

The closest option to 36.19% is **36%**, which corresponds to option **J**.
