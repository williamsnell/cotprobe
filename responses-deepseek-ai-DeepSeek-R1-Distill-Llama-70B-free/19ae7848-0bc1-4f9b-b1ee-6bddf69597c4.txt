Okay, so I have this economics problem here about banking and the money supply. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, the problem says a bank has $250,000 in deposits and reserves of $62,500. The required reserve ratio r is 25%. Then, a depositor withdraws $10,000 in cash and keeps it. We need to find out what happens to the potential money supply, assuming all other banks are "loaned up."

Wait, what's the required reserve ratio? Oh right, that's the percentage of deposits that banks must hold in reserves rather than lend out. So if the ratio is 25%, the bank must keep 25% of its deposits as reserves.

Let me jot down the numbers. The bank has deposits of $250,000, so reserves are $62,500. Let me check: 25% of 250k is indeed 62.5k. So that's correct.

Now, a depositor withdraws $10,000 cash. So, the bank's deposits will decrease by $10,000, right? Because the depositor is taking money out, so the bank's liability (deposits) goes down. But what happens to the bank's reserves?

When someone withdraws cash, the bank's reserves (which are part of the bank's assets) decrease. So, initially, the bank's reserves go down by $10,000 because they've given out that cash.

Wait, so before the withdrawal, the bank had $62,500 in reserves. After the withdrawal, they have $62,500 - $10,000 = $52,500 in reserves.

Now, the deposits go down by $10,000 to $240,000. But the required reserve ratio is still 25%, so the required reserves are 25% of $240,000, which is $60,000. Wait, no, because the new deposits are $240k, 25% of that is $60k. So the bank now needs to have at least $60k in reserves.

But after the withdrawal, their reserves are $52,500, which is less than the required $60k. That means the bank is short on reserves. So the bank needs to get more reserves. How? They might need to reduce their loans. Because when they call in loans, the money comes back to the bank as reserves.

Wait, but the question says all other banks in the system are "loaned up." Hmm, what does that mean? I think it means that other banks have already loaned out as much as they can, so they can't lend to this bank. So this bank can't borrow from others easily.

So, the bank has to adjust on its own. Their reserves are below the required ratio. So the bank has to reduce its loans to increase reserves. How much?

They have excess reserves before any change? Let's see. Initially, required reserves were 25% of 250k = 62.5k. They had exactly that, so excess reserves were zero. After the withdrawal, deposits are 240k, required reserves are 60k. But their current reserves are 52.5k. So they're short by 7.5k (60k -52.5k). So they need to increase reserves by 7.5k.

How can they do that? By reducing their loans. When a bank reduces its loans, the borrowers pay back the loans, and the money goes into the bank's reserves. So for every dollar the bank reduces in loans, their reserves increase by a dollar.

So the bank will have to call in $7,500 worth of loans. This means that borrowers will have to pay back $7,500, which reduces the amount of money they have. That money then goes into the bank's reserves.

Wait, but how does this affect the money supply? The money supply is influenced by the amount of loans because when banks make loans, they create money. So when they reduce loans, they're reducing the money supply.

Let me think about it step by step. Initially, the bank had deposits of 250k and reserves of 62.5k. So the loans they made were 250k -62.5k = 187.5k. After the withdrawal, deposits are 240k, but reserves drop to 52.5k. So the loans would be 240k -52.5k = 187.5k. Wait, that doesn't change. Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, no. Because after the withdrawal, the bank's reserves are 52.5k, but the required reserves are 60k. So they have to increase their reserves by 7.5k. So they reduce their loans by 7.5k. So the loans go from 187.5k to 180k.

But wait, the loans are assets for the bank. When the bank reduces the loans, that means the borrowers have less money. So the borrowers would have to pay back 7.5k. When they pay back, the money comes into the bank as reserves, so the bank's reserves go up by 7.5k, from 52.5k to 60k, which meets the required reserve.

But how does this affect the money supply? The money supply is the total of deposits plus currency in circulation. Or wait, no. The money supply in the economy is M1, which includes currency and checking deposits. But when the bank's loans decrease, it reduces the amount of money in the economy because less is being lent out and spent.

Wait, but in this case, the initial withdrawal increases currency in circulation by $10k, but the bank has to reduce loans by $7.5k, which reduces deposits elsewhere in the economy. So the net effect is an increase of 10k minus 7.5k, which is 2.5k. But that doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing concepts here. Let's think about the money multiplier. The money multiplier is 1/(r), so 1/0.25 = 4. So the initial money supply would be the total reserves times the multiplier. But wait, no, the money supply is calculated as deposits plus currency. Or perhaps the potential money supply is the maximum possible given the reserves.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial excess reserves are zero. So when the depositor withdraws $10k, the bank's reserves drop by 10k, deposits drop by 10k. The required reserves are now 25% of 240k = 60k. So the bank needs to have 60k in reserves. They have 52.5k, so they need 7.5k more. To get that, they must reduce loans by 7.5k.

So the bank reduces loans by 7.5k, which means that the money supply (which includes deposits) is reduced by 7.5k. But wait, the initial withdrawal of 10k in currency adds to the money supply because currency is part of M1. So the money supply increases by 10k, but decreases by 7.5k due to the loan reduction.

So the net effect is 10k -7.5k = +2.5k. But none of the options match that. So maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the change in the bank's reserves and how it affects the overall money supply through the multiplier effect.

Wait, when the bank's reserves change, it affects the lending capacity, which in turn affects the money supply. Let me think again.

After the withdrawal, the bank's reserves are 52.5k and deposits are 240k. Required reserves are 60k. So the bank is deficient in reserves by 7.5k. To fix this, the bank must reduce its loans by 7.5k. When loans decrease by 7.5k, that means that the borrowers will have 7.5k less in their deposits. So the total deposits in the system (across all banks) decrease by 7.5k.

But the currency in circulation increased by 10k because of the withdrawal. So the net change in money supply is +10k (currency) -7.5k (reduction in deposits) = +2.5k. But the options don't have +2.5k.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking only at the effect on the bank's balance sheet and the potential money supply, not the overall.

Wait, another approach. The money supply is affected by the change in reserves and the multiplier. The initial reserves were 62.5k. After the withdrawal, reserves are 52.5k. So the change in reserves is -10k. But wait, the required reserves also change because deposits have decreased.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential money supply is calculated using the formula:

Potential Money Supply = (Total Reserves) * (1 / r)

But wait, I think that formula is when excess reserves are zero, but maybe that's not directly applicable here.

Wait, initially, the bank had $62.5k in reserves, which is exactly 25% of deposits. So excess reserves were zero. After the withdrawal, the bank's reserves are $52.5k, but required reserves are 25% of $240k, which is $60k. So they have a reserve deficiency of $7.5k.

To get out of this deficiency, the bank must reduce lending. Each dollar reduction in loans increases reserves by a dollar. So they reduce loans by $7.5k, which increases their reserves to $60k, meeting the requirement.

So when the bank reduces loans by $7.5k, that means the money supply (from loans) decreases by $7.5k. But the currency in circulation increased by $10k, so the net effect on money supply is +10k -7.5k = +2.5k. But again, none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me consider the overall money supply. The initial money supply is the initial deposits plus currency. But when the depositor withdraws $10k, currency increases by $10k, and deposits decrease by $10k. So M1 would stay the same, because M1 = currency + demand deposits. So in that case, M1 wouldn't change. But that's only if the bank doesn't adjust anything. But the bank has to adjust by reducing loans, which would reduce deposits elsewhere.

Wait, let me think of it in terms of the money creation process. When a bank makes a loan, it creates deposits, increasing the money supply. When it reduces loans, it decreases deposits, thus decreasing the money supply.

So the initial situation: bank has deposits $250k, reserves $62.5k. So loans are $187.5k.

After withdrawal: deposits $240k, reserves $52.5k. Required reserves are $60k, so bank needs to get $7.5k more in reserves. So they call in $7.5k in loans. Now, loans are $180k.

So the reduction in loans is $7.5k. So the money supply from loans is reduced by $7.5k.

But the currency in circulation increased by $10k. So the net effect on M1 is +10k (currency) and -7.5k (deposits from loans). So total change is +2.5k.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reserve requirements and how the withdrawal affects the bank's ability to lend. Let's try another approach.

The required reserve ratio is 25%, so the bank must keep 25% of its deposits in reserves. The rest can be lent out.

Initially, the bank has $250k deposits. Reserves are $62.5k, so loans are $187.5k.

When a depositor withdraws $10k, the deposits drop to $240k. The bank's reserves are now $52.5k. But required reserves are 25% of $240k, which is $60k. So the bank is short by $7.5k in reserves.

To meet the reserve requirement, the bank must reduce its loans. How? By $7.5k, because each dollar reduction in loans increases reserves by a dollar.

So the bank reduces loans by $7.5k. This means that the borrowers will have $7.5k less in deposits. So the total deposits in the economy will decrease by $7.5k.

But the currency in circulation has increased by $10k due to the withdrawal. So the total money supply change is:

Currency up by $10k, deposits down by $7.5k. So net change is +2.5k. Again, not matching any options.

But looking at the options, I see E: no change. Hmmm. What if the money supply doesn't change? Because the increase in currency is offset by the decrease in deposits elsewhere. But in this case, the net is +2.5k, not zero.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in considering the entire system. Let me think about the money multiplier effect.

The money multiplier is 1/r = 4. So any change in reserves would impact the money supply by that multiplier.

But in this case, the reserves have decreased by $10k due to the withdrawal. So without any actions, the potential money supply would decrease by 10k *4 = $40k. But the bank takes action to reduce loans by $7.5k, which increases their reserves, but how does that affect the overall reserves?

Wait, perhaps the change in reserves is a net of the withdrawal and the loan reduction.

Initially, the bank's reserves were 62.5k. After withdrawal, they are 52.5k. But to meet the reserve requirement, they reduce loans by 7.5k, which increases their reserves by 7.5k, bringing them to 60k. So the net change in reserves is 60k -62.5k = -2.5k.

So the change in reserves is -2.5k. Using the money multiplier of 4, the potential money supply would change by -2.5k *4 = -10k. But again, none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the question is looking at the change in the bank's reserves and the resultant change in the money supply. Alternatively, maybe the initial reserves are considered as the base for the money multiplier.

Alternatively, when the bank's excess reserves change, the potential money supply changes.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the change in the monetary base and then apply the money multiplier.

The monetary base (high-powered money) is currency plus bank reserves. Initially, the bank's reserves are 62.5k, and currency is whatever it was before the withdrawal. After the withdrawal, currency increases by 10k, and bank reserves decrease by 10k. So the monetary base remains the same: 62.5k -10k (reserves) +10k (currency) = 62.5k. So the monetary base hasn't changed. Therefore, the money supply shouldn't change because the monetary base is the same.

Wait, that makes sense. Because when the depositor withdraws cash, the currency in circulation increases, but the bank's reserves decrease by the same amount. So the total monetary base (reserves + currency) remains unchanged. Therefore, the money supply, which is influenced by the monetary base and the money multiplier, should remain the same.

So the money supply doesn't change. Looking at the options, E says "no change in the money supply."

But wait, earlier I thought that the bank had to reduce loans, which would reduce the money supply. But if the monetary base is the same, perhaps the overall effect is no change.

Wait, maybe the confusion is between the bank's reserves and the overall monetary base. The bank's reserves went down by 10k, but the currency went up by 10k, so the total high-powered money (monetary base) is the same. Therefore, the potential money supply remains unchanged.

So the correct answer would be E: no change in the money supply.
</think>

To analyze the impact of the depositor's withdrawal on the potential money supply, we start by examining the bank's balance sheet and the broader monetary dynamics.

### Initial Conditions:
- **Deposits**: $250,000  
- **Reserves**: $62,500 (25% of deposits, as required by the reserve ratio).  
- **Loans**: $187,500 ($250,000 - $62,500).  

The bank is fully loaned up, meaning all excess reserves are already lent out.

### After the Withdrawal:
1. A depositor withdraws $10,000 in cash.  
   - **Deposits** decrease by $10,000, falling to $240,000.  
   - **Reserves** decrease by $10,000, falling to $52,500.  

2. The required reserve ratio is 25%, so the bank must hold at least $60,000 in reserves (25% of $240,000).  
   - The bank now has a reserve deficiency of $7,500 ($60,000 - $52,500).  

3. To address the reserve deficiency, the bank must reduce its loans by $7,500. When loans decrease, the money supply (deposits) decreases by the same amount.  

### Impact on the Money Supply:
- The withdrawal increases **currency in circulation** by $10,000.  
- The reduction in loans decreases **deposits** by $7,500.  

The net effect on the money supply is:  
$$ \text{Change in Money Supply} = +\$10,000 \, (\text{currency}) - \$7,500 \, (\text{deposits}) = +\$2,500. $$  

However, the question asks about the **potential money supply**, which depends on the monetary base (currency + bank reserves). Since the withdrawal increases currency by $10,000 and decreases reserves by $10,000, the monetary base remains unchanged. With the monetary base unchanged and the money multiplier (1/r = 4) also unchanged, the potential money supply remains the same.

### Conclusion:
The potential money supply does not change because the monetary base is unaffected by the withdrawal. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**E: no change in the money supply**
