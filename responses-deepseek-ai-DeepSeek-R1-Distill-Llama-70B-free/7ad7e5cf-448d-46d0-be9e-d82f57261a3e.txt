Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the problem is about.

Alright, the question says that a gun fires a projectile with a mass of 10 kg. The muzzle velocity is 140 m/s, and the target is 1000 meters away on the same horizontal plane as the gun. I need to find the angle at which the barrel must be elevated to hit the target. Oh, and I have to compare this with the case where there's no air resistance or any kind of retardation. Wait, but the problem specifically mentions Figure 2-3, which I don't have, but I guess it's about projectile motion under some kind of drag or resistance.

Hmm, so in projectile motion, when there's no air resistance, the horizontal velocity remains constant, and the vertical motion is affected by gravity. But when there's air resistance, the situation becomes more complicated because the projectile experiences a drag force, which depends on factors like velocity and maybe the cross-sectional area. Since the problem refers to Figure 2-3, I'm assuming that the curves provided there show how the range varies with the angle for different drag conditions. But without seeing the figure, I have to make some assumptions.

Wait, the question is about finding the angle when considering air resistance (or some kind of retardation) and comparing it to the case without. So I think I should probably calculate both scenarios: one with no air resistance and one with.

Starting with the no air resistance case. The range of a projectile without air resistance is given by R = (v² sin(2θ)) / g, where v is the initial velocity, θ is the launch angle, and g is the acceleration due to gravity (about 9.8 m/s²).

Wait, but wait a second. Oh, wait, the target is 1000 meters away. So R is 1000 meters.

So rearranging the equation, sin(2θ) = (g R) / v².

Plugging in the numbers: g is 9.8 m/s², R is 1000 m, v is 140 m/s.

So let's compute that: (9.8 * 1000) / (140^2) = 9800 / 19600 = 0.5.

So sin(2θ) = 0.5. Then 2θ = arcsin(0.5). The arcsin of 0.5 is 30 degrees, so θ would be 15 degrees.

Wait, but that's without any air resistance. So that's the angle for no retardation. Now, the problem is asking for the angle when there is some kind of retardation, which I'm assuming is air resistance, making the range shorter than the ideal case. But wait, in reality, with air resistance, the range is less than the no air case at the same angle. So if I'm firing to hit a target at 1000 m, which in the no air case would be achieved at 15 degrees, maybe with air resistance, I need a higher angle to compensate. Or wait, perhaps lower? Hmm, I'm a bit confused there.

Wait, another approach: when air resistance is present, the projectile's range is less for a given angle than without air resistance. So if without air resistance, 1000 m is achieved at 15 degrees, then with air resistance, maybe the same angle wouldn't reach as far. But in this problem, the target is at 1000 m, so with air resistance, the projectile wouldn't reach that far at 15 degrees. So to reach the same distance, the angle would have to be different. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure whether higher or lower. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: when air resistance is present, the optimal angle for maximum range is less than 45 degrees. Without air resistance, the maximum range is at 45 degrees. But with air resistance, it's lower. But in our problem, the target is at 1000 m, which in the no air case is achieved at 15 degrees. So if in the no air case, 15 degrees gives 1000 m, then with air resistance, perhaps a higher angle is needed to make up for the loss in range. Or maybe a lower angle. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when air resistance is present, the actual range at a given angle is less than the ideal range. So to achieve the same range as in the ideal case, the angle might have to be higher, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe the figure (2-3) gives the range versus angle curves for different initial velocities or different drag conditions. But without the figure, I can only guess.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed by first calculating the angle without air resistance, which I did earlier, and got θ = 15 degrees. That's one of the options, option E. But the question is asking about the case with retardation, so I need to figure that out.

Wait, but I don't have enough information about the nature of the retardation. So maybe I'm supposed to use some other approach, perhaps assuming that the curves in Figure 2-3 are for the same projectile, so maybe there's a specific way to read the angle off those curves.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, like considering that the time of flight is affected by the angle, and thus the horizontal distance is affected.

Wait, alternatively, maybe the problem is using a linear drag model, where the drag force is proportional to velocity. In that case, the equations become more complicated, and analytical solutions are harder. But perhaps the problem expects me to use some approximation or a given formula from the figure.

Wait, but without more information, perhaps the problem is intended to use the same approach as in the case without air resistance, but with some modification. Alternatively, perhaps I can model the problem in a simplified way.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the figure 2-3 provides the range as a function of angle, so that for a given initial velocity, the range is plotted against the angle, and from that, I can read off the angle needed for 1000 m.

Wait, but without the figure, perhaps the problem expects me to use the given options and the no air case to determine the answer. Since in the no air case, it's 15 degrees, and with air resistance, the angle is either higher or lower.

Wait, let me think again. Without air resistance, the maximum range is at 45 degrees. At 45 degrees, the range would be (v² sin(90))/g, which is (140^2 * 1)/9.8 = 19600/9.8 ≈ 2000 meters. So for a range of 1000 meters, the angle is 15 degrees, since sin(2θ) = 0.5, so 2θ is 30, θ is 15.

But with air resistance, the range would be less for any given angle. So to hit 1000 meters, which is the same as without air resistance, I might need a higher angle, because maybe the lower angles are more affected by air resistance. Or perhaps the opposite. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps when there's air resistance, the range decreases with lower angles more than higher angles. Wait, that seems a bit counterintuitive. Alternatively, maybe the range is more affected at higher angles because the time of flight is longer, so the effect of air resistance is more pronounced.

Wait, but without knowing the exact nature of the drag force, it's hard to say. But perhaps the problem expects me to use the fact that with air resistance, the optimal angle is lower than 45 degrees, as I thought earlier. So maybe for a given range, the required angle is higher than the no air case.

Wait, but wait, in the no air case, 15 degrees gives 1000 meters. If with air resistance, 15 degrees gives a shorter range, then perhaps I would need to increase the angle to get a longer range. Or maybe decrease it. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The problem mentions that the curves of Figure 2-3 apply, so perhaps the angle for 1000 meters is read directly from that figure. But without the figure, I can't do that. So maybe the problem expects me to use the no air case as a starting point.

Wait, looking at the options, option E is 15.2 degrees, which is very close to the 15 degrees I calculated for the no air case. But the problem is asking for the case with retardation, so perhaps the answer is slightly different.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as considering the time of flight, and then calculating the horizontal distance considering deceleration.

Wait, perhaps I can model the horizontal and vertical motions with air resistance. But that would require knowing the drag equation, which is typically F = kv, where k is a constant. But without knowing k, it's impossible to compute.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the deceleration is uniform. Wait, but that's not realistic because drag force depends on velocity squared or velocity, but perhaps for this problem, it's modeled as a constant deceleration in the horizontal direction.

Wait, if I assume that the horizontal motion is subject to a constant deceleration a, then the horizontal velocity would decrease over time. The horizontal distance would be given by x = v_x * t - 0.5 * a * t². But without knowing a, I can't compute this. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the answer in the options, considering that when air resistance is present, the angle required is higher than the no air case. Since in the no air case, it's 15 degrees, perhaps the answer is higher, say 19.1 degrees, which is option C. Alternatively, maybe 17.4 degrees, option A.

Wait, but perhaps another approach: for the no air case, the angle is 15 degrees. If with air resistance, the range is shorter, so to get the same range, perhaps a higher angle is needed. So the angle would be higher than 15 degrees. So looking at the options, 17.4 is option A, 19.1 is C, 16.2 is B, 15.2 is E.

Wait, but another thought: in the presence of air resistance, the range for a given angle is less than the no air case. So if without air resistance, 15 degrees gives 1000 m, with air resistance, 15 degrees would give less than 1000 m. So to achieve 1000 m, we need a higher angle because higher angles have longer time of flight, but perhaps with more effect from air resistance, so maybe a lower angle would be better. Wait, I'm confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the trajectory. Without air resistance, the path is symmetrical. With air resistance, the trajectory is lower, so perhaps the angle needs to be increased to compensate. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that in the case with air resistance, the range is maximized at a lower angle than 45 degrees. So for maximum range, the angle is lower. But for a specific range, the required angle could be higher or lower than the no air case, depending on where the range lies relative to the maximum.

Wait, but I'm stuck without knowing more about the specific drag model here. So perhaps I should proceed with the no air case and then consider that the angle is different based on the options given.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the problem isn't about comparing the two cases directly but is simply asking for the angle under the specific conditions of Figure 2-3. Since I don't have the figure, maybe I can only proceed with the no air case, which gives 15 degrees, and then see which option is closest. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is higher than 15 degrees.

Looking back, the options are:

A: 17.4°, B:16.2°, C:19.1°, D:13.8°, E:15.2°, F:18.6°, G:25.3°, H:20.7°, I:14.9°, J:22.5°.

Wait, the no air case is 15 degrees, which is option E (15.2°), very close. So perhaps the answer with air resistance is either slightly higher or lower. But without knowing, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the figure shows that for 1000 m, the angle is higher than 15°, so the answer is option A or C.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I can use the fact that when air resistance is present, the range is approximately R ≈ (v² sin(2θ)) / (g + (k/m) v), where k is a drag coefficient, but without knowing k or m, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplified, and I can assume that the horizontal deceleration is constant. Let's say the projectile experiences a horizontal deceleration 'a', then the time of flight would be determined by the vertical motion.

Wait, but even that approach requires knowing 'a', which I don't have.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since the problem refers to Figure 2-3, which I don't have, perhaps I can make an educated guess based on the options given.

Wait, perhaps the answer is 19.1 degrees, option C. Because 15 degrees gives 1000 m without air, so with air resistance, maybe the angle is higher. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 17.4 degrees, option A.

Wait, wait, perhaps I can think about it this way: with air resistance, the time of flight is less than without air resistance, so to hit the target at 1000 m, perhaps a higher initial horizontal velocity is needed, which would imply a lower angle. Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps a lower angle would result in a shorter range because the horizontal velocity is higher but the time of flight is shorter. Hmm, I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the given options and the fact that the no air case is 15 degrees, and the answer is slightly higher, making option A (17.4) the correct one. Alternatively, maybe option C (19.1) is correct.

But wait, I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the figure 2-3 provides a graph where for a given initial velocity, you can read off the angle that gives a particular range. For example, if the figure shows that at 140 m/s, the range of 1000 m occurs at 19.1 degrees, then the answer would be option C.

Alternatively, if the figure shows that without air resistance, it's 15 degrees, but with air resistance, it's higher, say 19.1, then option C is correct.

But given that I don't have the figure, I can only guess. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A:17.4 degrees.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the effect of air resistance. Without air resistance, the angle is 15 degrees. With air resistance, perhaps the angle needed is higher because the projectile doesn't go as far at lower angles. So to compensate, we might need a higher angle to reach the same distance.

So if without air resistance, 15 degrees gives 1000 m, with air resistance, a higher angle is needed. Looking at the options, 17.4 (A), 19.1 (C), 18.6 (F) are higher. So perhaps it's one of these.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C:19.1 degrees.

Wait, but then again, perhaps I should consider that the maximum range with air resistance is less than the no air case. So the maximum range in no air is 2000 m at 45 degrees. With air resistance, it's less, say, for example, 1000 m might require a higher angle than 15 degrees.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 19.1 degrees.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Another approach: perhaps the given options have 15.2 as E, which is very close to 15, so perhaps that's the no air case, and the correct answer with air resistance is higher, say 19.1 (C), which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option A:17.4.

Wait, I'm stuck. I think I should make an educated guess. Since the no air case is 15 degrees, and with air resistance, the angle is higher, perhaps the answer is 17.4 degrees (option A) or 19.1 (C).

Wait, but I think I remember that when air resistance is present, the angle needed to reach a certain distance is lower than the no air case. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because if you have more drag, you need to fire at a higher angle to compensate for the loss in horizontal velocity over time.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of time of flight. At higher angles, the time of flight is longer, which means more time for air resistance to act, reducing the horizontal distance. So to reach the same horizontal distance, perhaps you need a lower angle, to have a shorter time of flight, thus less effect from air resistance.

Wait, that seems more plausible. So if in the no air case, 15 degrees gives 1000 m, with air resistance, perhaps a lower angle is needed. But looking at the options, the angles lower than 15 are D (13.8) and I (14.9), and E is 15.2, which is slightly higher.

Wait, but that contradicts my earlier thought. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to accept that without seeing the figure, it's impossible to know, and perhaps the intended answer is option C:19.1 degrees.

But since I'm not sure, perhaps I should pick option C:19.1 degrees.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze the projectile motion under two scenarios: with and without air resistance. The goal is to determine the angle at which the gun must be elevated to hit a target 1000 m away.

### Case 1: No Air Resistance
The range of a projectile without air resistance is given by:

\[
R = \frac{v^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}
\]

Rearranging for \(\sin(2\theta)\):

\[
\sin(2\theta) = \frac{gR}{v^2}
\]

Substituting the given values (\(g = 9.8 \, \mathrm{m/s^2}\), \(R = 1000 \, \mathrm{m}\), \(v = 140 \, \mathrm{m/s}\)):

\[
\sin(2\theta) = \frac{9.8 \cdot 1000}{140^2} = \frac{9800}{19600} = 0.5
\]

Thus:

\[
2\theta = \arcsin(0.5
