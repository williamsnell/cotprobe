Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Bandura's social learning theory, specifically about self-reinforcement. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it.

The question is asking about the role of self-reinforcement in the absence of external rewards. So, I remember that Bandura's theory includes several key concepts: observation, imitation, modeling, and reinforcement. Self-reinforcement must be one of those components.

Wait, self-reinforcement... I think that's when people reward themselves for certain behaviors. Like, if you do something good, you might treat yourself to something, or maybe just feel good about it. This would be an internal reward system, right?

The question is about how, without external rewards, self-reinforcement explains how behavior is maintained. So in social learning theory, external rewards aren't always necessary for learning or maintaining behavior. Instead, people can internally reinforce themselves, which keeps the behavior going over time.

Looking at the options now. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Peer pressure influences decision making. I'm not sure how this ties to self-reinforcement. Peer pressure is more about external influences, maybe related to observational learning, but not directly about self-reinforcement.

Option B: Children can overcome the negative effects of poor models. That doesn't seem right. If models are poor, maybe the children wouldn't imitate them, but this doesn't directly relate to self-reinforcement.

Option C: Punishment can be avoided. Punishment is an external factor. If you're avoiding it, that's more about external reinforcement, not internal.

Option D: The impact of positive reinforcement is amplified. Positive reinforcement is external, so again, not about self-reinforcement.

Option E: Learned behavior is maintained over time. This sounds plausible. If there's no external reward, self-reinforcement would help maintain the behavior because the person internally rewards themselves.

Option F: Rival responses are acquired. I'm not too sure about this term. Rival responses might refer to competing behaviors, but I don't see the direct link to self-reinforcement.

Option G: Children can learn to mimic adult behavior. Mimicry is more about observation and imitation, not necessarily about the maintenance without external rewards.

Option H: Children learn to differentiate between right and wrong. That's more about moral development, maybe involving reinforcement but not specifically self-reinforcement.

Option I: Children can imitate behavior without understanding its implications. This is about imitation, perhaps, but again, not directly about internal reinforcement maintaining behavior over time.

Option J: Socially appropriate behavior can be learned without models. Without models, maybe through self-reinforcement, but I'm not sure if that's the main point here.

So, putting it together, the question is about how in the absence of external rewards, self-reinforcement explains the maintenance of behavior. The answer should relate to how learned behavior continues because of internal rewards. Option E says "learned behavior is maintained over time," which fits because self-reinforcement would sustain the behavior even without external rewards.

Wait, but let me double-check. Bandura's self-reinforcement is about the individual's internal system of rewards, like feeling proud or satisfied, which reinforces and maintains the behavior. So without external rewards, the internal ones take over, ensuring that the behavior continues. So yes, that's about maintaining the learned behavior over time.

The concept of self-reinforcement in Bandura's social learning theory refers to the internal reward system individuals use to maintain behaviors. When external rewards are absent, self-reinforcement ensures that learned behaviors persist over time. This involves internal rewards, such as feelings of pride or satisfaction, which sustain the behavior. Among the options provided, the one that best aligns with this explanation is:

E: Learned behavior is maintained over time.

This option directly addresses how self-reinforcement sustains behavior in the absence of external rewards, making it the correct choice.

Answer: E
