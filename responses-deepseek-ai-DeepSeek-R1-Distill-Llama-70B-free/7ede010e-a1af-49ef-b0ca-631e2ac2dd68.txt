Okay, so I'm looking at this question about criminal law, specifically murder charges. Hmm, let's break it down step by step. The question is a bit long, but I'll try to digest it.

So, the defendant hated the victim and decided to kill him. He put a loaded gun in his coat pocket and went for a walk, not sure if or when he'd see the victim. Then he went into a bar, had several beers, got intoxicated. On his way home, he bumped into the victim, recognized him, pulled out the gun, and shot him dead.

The jurisdiction defines first-degree murder as premeditated and deliberate killing. All other murders are second-degree. So, I need to figure out what the defendant is guilty of.

First, let's recall the elements of murder. Murder typically requires malice aforethought. First-degree is usually premeditated, deliberate, and intentional. Second-degree might be intentional but without premeditation, or acts with reckless indifference, etc.

In this case, the defendant initially had the intent to kill the victim. He planned it by bringing the gun. But then he went to a bar, got drunk, and only later encountered the victim. So, the question is whether the initial plan was still in effect when he actually killed the victim.

Wait, but he was intoxicated. How does intoxication affect this? I remember that voluntary intoxication can sometimes negate specific intent. First-degree murder requires premeditation and deliberation, which are specific intents. If the defendant was too intoxicated to form that specific intent, he might not be guilty of first-degree murder.

But let's think about the timeline. He had the gun with him when he left home, but then he went to the bar. So, he had the gun before getting intoxicated. Then, after drinking, when he saw the victim, he acted. The key is whether his intoxication prevented him from having the necessary premeditation and deliberation at the time of the act.

Wait, but premeditation can be formed quickly. If he decided right there, upon seeing the victim, to shoot him, that could still be premeditated if he had the time to think about it. But if he was so intoxicated that he couldn't form that intent, then it might reduce the charge.

Alternatively, maybe the initial intent to kill was present, but the actual killing was done under the influence, which might affect the degree. Or, perhaps the act of bringing the gun shows premeditation, even if the actual pulling of the trigger was impulsive while drunk.

Wait, another angle: The initial plan was to kill, but he was walking around, not sure when he'd see the victim. So, perhaps the premeditation was already there. But after getting drunk, when he saw the victim, did he have the capacity to deliberate?

Hmm, in some jurisdictions, voluntary intoxication can reduce murder to manslaughter if it negates malice aforethought. But here, the killing was intentional, so it's murder unless the intoxication negates the specific intent required for first-degree.

Wait, but first-degree requires premeditation and deliberation. If the defendant was so intoxicated that he couldn't deliberate, then he can't be guilty of first-degree. But second-degree murder is intentional killing without premeditation, so maybe that's the case.

Alternatively, if the initial intent was there, and the act was intentional, even if under the influence, maybe it's still first-degree. But I think that voluntary intoxication can negate the specific intent, so first-degree might not apply, making it second-degree.

Wait, but does the initial plan count even if he's intoxicated later? Let me think. The premeditation could have been formed when he was sober, but when he actually commits the act, he's intoxicated. So, does the premeditation from before still count if he's too drunk to deliberate at the time?

I'm a bit confused. Some sources say that the premeditation must occur before the act, but if at the time of the act, the defendant couldn't deliberate because of intoxication, that might mean he couldn't form the specific intent needed for first-degree.

So, the defendant had the intent when he left home, but by the time he encountered the victim, he was drunk. So, the actual killing might have been intentional but without the necessary deliberation for first-degree.

Therefore, he might be guilty of second-degree murder because it's intentional but without premeditation and deliberation, which are required for first-degree.

Alternatively, if the initial plan is enough, but I think the law requires that the premeditation occur at the time of the killing. So, if he was too drunk to deliberate then, it's second-degree.

Another point: The defendant's initial decision was premeditated. But when he went to the bar and got drunk, maybe that breaks the chain of premeditation. Or perhaps it's a continuous plan. But the act of getting drunk might have interrupted the specific intent.

Wait, but he still had the gun on him after getting drunk. So, perhaps the premeditation was still present, and the intoxication didn't negate it because he still intended to kill when he saw the victim.

Hmm. I'm a bit torn. But I think that in many jurisdictions, voluntary intoxication can negate the specific intent for first-degree murder. So, even if he initially planned it, if he was too drunk to deliberate at the time, it's second-degree.

So, the answer would be C: second-degree murder.
</think>

The defendant initially planned to kill the victim, bringing a loaded gun. However, he became intoxicated at a bar before encountering the victim. Intoxication can negate the specific intent required for first-degree murder, which includes premeditation and deliberation. While the defendant had initial intent, the question is whether he could deliberate at the time of the act due to intoxication. Since first-degree murder requires deliberation at the time of the act, and intoxication likely prevented this, the defendant is guilty of second-degree murder, which does not require premeditation.
