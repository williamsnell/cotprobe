Okay, let me try to figure this one out. So, the question is about forced convection in a pipe, and I need to find the temperature of the inside wall surface. Hmm, I remember that in heat transfer, when a fluid flows through a pipe and there's heat exchange, the wall temperature can be different from the fluid temperatures.

Wait, the water is cooling the inside of the pipe. So the heat is being transferred from the pipe to the water, right? Or is it the other way around? Oh wait, no, the question says water cools the inside, so the pipe might be hotter than the water. Or maybe the water is absorbing heat from the pipe. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the heat transfer equation.

The given data: mass flow rate is 200 lbm/hr. Pipe length is 10 ft, internal diameter 4 inches. Entrance temp of water is 40°F, exit is 100°F. So the water is heating up as it flows through the pipe, which suggests that heat is being added to the water from the pipe. So the pipe wall must be hotter than the water.

I think I need to calculate the heat transfer rate first. The heat transferred would be the mass flow rate multiplied by the specific heat capacity of water and the temperature change. Oh wait, but I need to make sure the units are consistent.

Wait, the mass flow rate is 200 lbm/hr. Let me convert that into more standard units. Oh right, 200 lbm/hr divided by 3600 seconds in an hour gives lbm/s, but maybe I don't need to convert time units yet. Or perhaps I can work in imperial units since the other given data is in feet and Fahrenheit.

The specific heat of water is around 1 Btu/lbm·°F, I think. So the heat transfer rate Q would be:

Q = m_dot * c_p * (T_exit - T_entrance)

m_dot is 200 lbm/hr
c_p is 1 Btu/lbm°F
ΔT is 100 - 40 = 60°F

So Q = 200 * 1 * 60 = 12,000 Btu/hr.

Wait, but I remember that in the formula, the heat transfer rate is also given by Q = U * A * ΔT, where U is the overall heat transfer coefficient and A is the area. Oh wait, no, that's for double pipe exchangers perhaps. Alternatively, in convection, Q = h * A * (T_wall - T_bulk), where h is the convective heat transfer coefficient, A is the surface area, and T_bulk is the bulk temperature of the fluid.

Wait, but I don't know h here. Hmm. Maybe I should think about using the convection equation for a pipe flow. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the effectiveness-NTU method, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the average bulk temperature of the water and relate it to the wall temperature using the convection formula.

Wait, but to proceed, perhaps I should calculate the average bulk temperature. The water goes from 40°F to 100°F, so the average is (40+100)/2 = 70°F. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable.

Alternatively, the heat transfer equation is Q = m_dot * c_p * (T_exit - T_entrance) as I did earlier, which gives Q=12,000 Btu/hr.

But another expression for Q is Q = h * A * (T_wall - T_bulk), where T_bulk is the average temperature of the fluid. Wait, but the fluid's temperature is changing along the pipe, so the appropriate T_bulk might be the average of the inlet and outlet temperatures. So 70°F.

So, I have Q= h * A * (T_wall - 70°F).

But I don't know h, the convection heat transfer coefficient. How do I find h? Oh, right, for forced convection in a pipe, we can use the Dittus-Boelter equation, which is Nu = 0.023 Re^0.8 Pr^0.33.

Nu is the Nusselt number, which is h*D/k, where D is diameter, and k is thermal conductivity.

But wait, I need to know the properties of water at the average temperature. Let me think: the average temp of the water is 70°F, which is about 21°C. The properties of water at around 70°F would be:

- Density (rho) around 62.3 lbm/ft³
- Specific heat (cp) 1 Btu/lbm°F
- Viscosity (mu) maybe around 2.04 centiPoise, which is 0.00104 lbm/(ft·hr) because 1 centiPoise = 0.000672 lbm/(ft·hr)
Wait, let me get that right. 1 Poise = 1 dyne·s/cm². In SI units, 1 Pa·s = 10 Poise. But in imperial units, 1 centiPoise = 0.001 Poise.

Wait, converting viscosity to lbm/(ft·hr):

I think 1 Poise = 0.0020886 lbm/(ft·hr). So 1 centiPoise is 0.000020886 lbm/(ft·hr). So at 70°F, water has a viscosity of about 0.000020886 * (some value). Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look up the approximate value. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the Reynolds number.

Wait, the formula for Reynolds number is Re = (m_dot * D) / (A * mu). Wait, no, more accurately, Re = rho * V * D / mu. But V is the velocity.

Alternatively, Re = (4 * m_dot) / (pi * D * mu). Because m_dot is the mass flow rate, which is rho * A * V. So m_dot = rho * (pi D²/4) * V. So solving for V, V = (4 m_dot) / (rho pi D²).

Wait, perhaps I can compute Re using the mass flow rate. The mass flow rate is 200 lbm/hr. Let me compute the velocity first.

The diameter D is 4 inches, which is 4/12 ft = 1/3 ft ≈ 0.3333 ft.

The cross-sectional area A = pi D² /4 = pi (0.3333)^2 /4 ≈ 0.08727 ft².

But wait, mass flow rate m_dot is 200 lbm/hr. So velocity V = m_dot / (rho * A). But rho is 62.3 lbm/ft³.

So V = 200 lbm/hr / (62.3 lbm/ft³ * 0.08727 ft²) * (1 hr / 3600 s) ?

Wait, that's a bit messy. Alternatively, convert units.

Wait, let's think in terms of units.

m_dot = 200 lbm/hr.

So, m_dot = 200 lbm/hr = (200 / 3600) lbm/s ≈ 0.055555 lbm/s.

But maybe it's easier to convert to lbm/(ft²·s) or something. Alternatively, perhaps compute the velocity in ft/s.

Alternatively, compute volumetric flow rate first. Density rho is approximately 62.3 lbm/ft³. So 1 ft³ of water weighs 62.3 lbm. So the volumetric flow rate Q_vol is m_dot / rho = 200 lbm/hr / 62.3 lbm/ft³ = approx 3.21 ft³/hr. To get ft³/s, divide by 3600: 3.21 / 3600 ≈ 0.0008917 ft³/s.

Then, velocity V = Q_vol / A. Area A is pi*(4 in/2)^2 * (1 ft/12 in)². Wait, diameter is 4 inches, so radius is 2 inches = 2/12 ft = 1/6 ft. So area A = pi * (1/6)^2 ≈ pi/36 ≈ 0.08727 ft².

So V = 0.0008917 ft³/s / 0.08727 ft² ≈ 0.01021 ft/s.

Wait, that's really slow. Is that right? Let me check units again. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, m_dot is 200 lbm/hr. So 200 lbm/hr divided by density (62.3 lbm/ft³) gives volume per hour: 200 /62.3 ≈3.21 ft³/hr. Then, divide by 3600 to get per second: 3.21 /3600 ≈0.0008917 ft³/s. Then, area is pi*(D/2)^2, D is 0.3333 ft, so (0.3333/2)^2 = (0.16665)^2 ≈0.02778 ft². Multiply by pi: ~0.08727 ft².

So velocity V = 0.0008917 / 0.08727 ≈ 0.01021 ft/s. That's about 0.68 ft/min, which seems really slow. Maybe that's correct? Or perhaps I should double-check the calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the Reynolds number using the formula Re = (m_dot * D) / (A * mu). Let me try that.

Re = (m_dot * D) / (A * mu)

m_dot is 200 lbm/hr.

But wait, the formula is Re = (4 m_dot) / (pi D mu). Because m_dot is the mass flow rate, which for a pipe is (rho * V * A), and Re is (rho V D)/mu. So substituting, Re = (4 m_dot) / (pi D mu).

But I need to convert units properly.

Let me get all the variables in consistent units.

m_dot = 200 lbm/hr

D = 4 inches = 0.3333 ft

mu for water at 70°F is about 0.00002089 lbm/(ft·hr), as per earlier calculation.

So Re = (4 * 200 lbm/hr) / (pi * 0.3333 ft * 0.00002089 lbm/(ft·hr)) )

Let me compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 4*200 = 800 lbm/hr

Denominator: pi * 0.3333 ft * 0.00002089 lbm/(ft·hr) → pi * 0.3333 * 0.00002089 ≈ approximately 3.1416 * 0.3333 ≈1.0472; 1.0472 * 0.00002089 ≈0.00002187 lbm/hr.

So Re = 800 / 0.00002187 ≈ 800 / 0.00002187 = approximately 36,560.

Hmm, that's a Reynolds number around 36,560, which is in the turbulent flow regime (since Re > 4000). So that's good, because the Dittus-Boelter equation applies to turbulent flow.

Now, using Dittus-Boelter equation: Nu = 0.023 Re^0.8 Pr^0.33.

I need the Prandtl number Pr for water at 70°F. Let me recall: for water, at around 70°F, Pr is about 7.0. Wait, I'm not sure, but I think that's approximate. Let me think: yes, around 7.00.

So, Pr ≈7.

So Nu = 0.023 * (36,560)^0.8 * (7)^0.33.

First compute Re^0.8: 36560^0.8. Let me compute that.

I can take natural logs: ln(36560) = about ln(3.6e4) ≈10.906.

Multiply by 0.8: 10.906 *0.8 ≈8.725.

Exp(8.725) ≈  5,600? Wait, exp(8)=2980, exp(8.725)=?

Wait, perhaps I should compute 36560^0.8.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 36560^0.8 as (3.656e4)^0.8 = (3.656)^0.8 * (1e4)^0.8.

(1e4)^0.8 = (10^4)^0.8 =10^(3.2)= about 10^3 * 10^0.2= 1000 * 1.5849≈1584.9.

Now, 3.656^0.8: let me think, 3^0.8 is about 2.408, 4^0.8 ≈3.027. 3.656 is closer to 3.6. Let me compute 3.6^0.8.

Alternatively, perhaps using logarithm:

ln(3.656)=1.294

1.294 *0.8=1.035, exp(1.035)=2.813.

So 3.656^0.8≈2.813.

So 36560^0.8≈2.813 *1584.9 ≈4454.

Now, 0.023 * 4454 ≈102.42.

Next, multiply by Pr^0.33. Pr is 7, so 7^0.33.

7^0.33= e^(ln(7)*0.33) ≈ e^(1.9459*0.33)≈ e^0.642≈1.900.

So Nu=102.42 *1.900≈194.50.

Now, Nu is h*D/k. So h = Nu *k / D.

What's the thermal conductivity k of water at 70°F? I think it's about 0.364 W/m·K, but wait, in imperial units, it's approximately 0.43 Btu/(hr·ft·°F). Let me confirm: yes, around 0.43 Btu/(hr·ft·°F).

Wait, I think it's 0.43 Btu·in/(hr·ft²·°F) for water. Hmm, maybe I should double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I can use k=0.43 Btu/(hr·ft·°F).

So, h = Nu *k / D.

Nu is 194.5, k is 0.43, D is 0.3333 ft.

So h= (194.5 *0.43) /0.3333 = (83.885)/0.3333 ≈252.12 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Wait, that seems a bit high, but maybe okay.

Now, the heat transfer rate Q is given by Q = h * A * (T_wall - T_bulk).

We have Q=12,000 Btu/hr from earlier.

A is the surface area of the pipe. The pipe is 10 ft long, diameter 4 inches, so the circumference is pi*D. So the area A=pi*D*L.

D=0.3333 ft, L=10 ft.

So A= pi *0.3333 *10 ≈3.1416*3.333≈10.472 ft².

So, Q= h*A*(T_wall - T_bulk)

We have Q=12,000 = 252.12 *10.472 * (T_wall -70)

Let me compute 252.12 *10.472.

252.12 *10=2521.2, 252.12*0.472≈252.12*0.4=100.848, 252.12*0.072≈18.153. So 100.848+18.153≈118. So total 2521.2 +118≈2639.2.

So 12,000 = 2639.2 * (T_wall -70)

So (T_wall -70) = 12,000 /2639.2 ≈4.548°F.

So T_wall ≈70 +4.548≈74.548°F.

Wait, that can't be right because the water is heating up from 40 to 100, so the wall should be hotter than the exit temperature. But according to this, the wall is only 74.5°F, which is between 40 and 100. That doesn't make sense.

Hmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back and check the calculations.

Wait, when I calculated Q = m_dot * c_p * ΔT, I assumed that Q is positive because the water is heating up. But the heat is being transferred from the wall to the water, so the wall must be hotter than the water. So the wall temp should be higher than 100°F.

So why is my calculation giving T_wall at 74°F, which is lower than both entrance and exit? Clearly, something's wrong.

Ah, perhaps I messed up the formula for Q. Wait, Q is the heat added to the water, which should be positive, so Q = m_dot c_p (T_exit - T_entrance). That part is correct.

But in the heat transfer equation, when the wall is hotter than the fluid, Q = h A (T_wall - T_bulk). So in this case, T_wall must be higher than the bulk temperature.

Wait, the average bulk temperature is 70°F, but perhaps I should use a different approach. Maybe I should calculate the log mean temperature difference or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model this as a steady-state heat transfer in a pipe, and find the wall temperature.

But I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the Reynolds number. Let me double-check that.

Re = (4 m_dot) / (pi D mu)

m_dot is 200 lbm/hr.

Wait, but the formula uses mass flow rate in lbm/hr, D in ft, and mu in lbm/(ft·hr).

So:

Re = (4 * 200) / (pi * 0.3333 * 0.00002089)

Compute denominator: pi *0.3333≈1.0472; 1.0472 * 0.00002089≈0.00002187.

So numerator is 800.

So Re=800 /0.00002187≈36,560. That seems correct.

Then, Nu=0.023 * Re^0.8 * Pr^0.33.

Using Re=36,560, Pr=7.

36,560^0.8: perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, 36,560^(0.8) = e^(0.8 * ln(36560)).

ln(36560)= about 10.908.

0.8 *10.908=8.726.

e^8.726≈5,  5,  let me compute e^8
