Okay, so I've got this question here where I need to find the deviation of each value from the mean. The values given are 4, 4, 6, 7, 9. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my statistics, but I think I can figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that the deviation from the mean is each value minus the mean of the dataset. So I need to calculate the mean first. The mean is the average, right? So I add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are.

Let me add them up: 4 + 4 is 8, plus 6 is 14, plus 7 is 21, and then plus 9 is 30. Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, 4 plus 4 is 8, plus 6 makes 14, plus 7 is 21, plus 9 is 30. Yeah, that's right. So the total is 30.

Now, how many numbers are there? Let's see, 4,4,6,7,9. That's five numbers. So the mean is 30 divided by 5, which is 6. Okay, so the mean is 6.

Now I need to find each value minus the mean. So for each number, subtract 6.

Let's do that one by one.

First number is 4. 4 - 6 is -2.

Second number is also 4. 4 -6 is -2 again.

Third number is 6. 6-6 is 0.

Fourth number is 7. 7-6 is 1.

Fifth number is 9. 9-6 is 3.

So the deviations are: -2, -2, 0, 1, 3.

Wait, let me double-check that. Maybe I made a mistake in adding earlier. Oh wait, no, 30 divided by 5 is 6. So that's right.

Now, looking at the options. Let's see each option's sequence and see which one matches.

Option H: -2, -2, 0, 1, 3. Hmm, that's exactly what I calculated. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but let me check the other options just to be sure. Option C is -2, -1, 0, 2, 3. No, that doesn't fit. Option H seems correct. Let me check the others quickly.

Option B: -2, 0, 2, etc. Doesn't match. Option E: No. Option H matches my calculated deviations.

To determine the deviation of each value from the mean, we first calculate the mean of the dataset. The given values are 4, 4, 6, 7, and 9. 

1. **Calculate the mean**:  
   The sum of the values is \( 4 + 4 + 6 + 7 + 9 = 30 \).  
   There are 5 values, so the mean is \( \frac{30}{5} = 6 \).

2. **Compute the deviation of each value from the mean**:  
   - \( 4 - 6 = -2 \)  
   - \( 4 - 6 = -2 \)  
   - \( 6 - 6 = 0 \)  
   - \( 7 - 6 = 1 \)  
   - \( 9 - 6 = 3 \)  

   The deviations are: \( -2, -2, 0, 1, 3 \).

3. **Match with the options**:  
   Comparing the calculated deviations with the given options, the correct match is **Option H**.

Answer: H
