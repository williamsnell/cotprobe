Last week, Paul ate 2 cookies each day for 5 days. This week, he ate 2 cookies each day for 4 days. Which expression can be used to represent the total number of cookies Paul ate in these two weeks?

Options:

A: (5+4) x2
B: (2+5) +(2+4)
C: 2x (5+ 4)
D: (2x5)x (2x4)
E: 2x (5-4)
F: (2+5)x(2+4)
G: 2x (5x4)
H: 2x5x4
I: 2x (4x5)

Okay, so I need to figure out which expression represents the total number of cookies Paul ate over the two weeks. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's look at what happened each week. Last week, Paul ate 2 cookies each day for 5 days. So for last week, the calculation would be 2 cookies multiplied by 5 days. That makes sense because each day he eats the same number, so multiplication is the right approach here.

Similarly, this week, he ate 2 cookies each day but for 4 days. So for this week, it's 2 cookies times 4 days. Again, multiplication is the way to go.

Now, the question is asking for the total number of cookies over both weeks. So I think I need to add the cookies from last week and this week together. That would be (2x5) + (2x4). Let me compute that: 2 times 5 is 10, and 2 times 4 is 8. Adding those together gives 18 cookies in total.

But wait, looking at the answer options, I don't see that exact expression. Let me check the options again. Option A is (5+4)x2, which is 9x2=18. Option C is 2x(5+4), which also equals 18. Hmm, so both A and C give the same result. But which one correctly represents the situation?

Let me think about what each option represents. Option A: (5+4) is the total number of days (5 +4=9 days). Then multiplying by 2 gives 18. That makes sense because over 9 days, he ate 2 each day. So 9x2=18.

Option C is 2x(5+4). Wait, that's the same as option A because multiplication is commutative. 2x9 is 18. So both expressions are mathematically correct and give the same result.

But I need to choose between the two. The question is about which expression represents the situation. So the situation is he ate 2 each day for 5 days and 2 each day for 4 days.

Alternatively, since the number of cookies per day is the same (2) across both weeks, I can factor that out. So instead of calculating each week separately and adding, I can add the days first and then multiply by 2. That would be (5+4) days times 2 cookies per day, which is option A.

But wait, option C is 2 times (5+4). That's the same as option A because 2x(5+4) is 2x9=18, and (5+4)x2 is also 18. So both A and C are correct mathematically. But the phrasing of the problem might suggest one is more appropriate than the other.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. The two weeks are separate. So maybe the correct way is to add the two separate products. But looking at the options, none of them directly show (2x5)+(2x4). Let me look again.

Option A: (5+4)x2 → same as 2x9=18.

Option C: 2x(5+4) → same as 18.

Hmm, so both are correct.

Wait, but the way the problem is worded, Paul ate 2 cookies each day for 5 days last week and 2 each day for 4 days this week. So the total is 2*5 + 2*4 = 10 +8=18.

But in terms of expression, the way to write this would be 2*(5+4) because you're combining the days first and then multiplying by 2 (the rate per day). Alternatively, you can factor out the 2, so 2*(5+4) is the same as (5+4)*2.

Wait, so both options A and C are correct. But that can't be right because the question expects one answer. Let me look back at the options.

Looking again, option C is 2x(5+4), which is the same as (5+4)x2 (option A). So both options are correct in terms of giving the right answer, but perhaps the way the problem is structured, the expression should reflect the sum of the days multiplied by the rate.

Alternatively, another approach: think of it as each week's contribution. So last week: 2*5=10, this week: 2*4=8. Total is 18. So the expression is 2*5 + 2*4. But none of the options directly present that. Instead, the options factor the 2 out.

So the correct expression would be 2*(5+4), which is option C. Because that's factoring out the common factor (2 cookies) from both weeks.

Wait, but option A is (5+4)*2, which is the same as 2*(5+4). So both would yield the same result. So why are there two options giving the same answer?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is about which expression correctly represents the total. Since both A and C are mathematically correct, maybe I need to look for the one that correctly models the situation.

Wait, another angle: the total number of cookies is the sum of the two weeks, which is 2*5 + 2*4. This can be rewritten as 2*(5+4) by factoring out the 2. So the expression 2*(5+4) is the factored form, which is option C.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.

To determine the total number of cookies Paul ate over the two weeks, we analyze the situation as follows:

- **Last week**: Paul ate 2 cookies each day for 5 days, which is calculated as \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) cookies.
- **This week**: Paul ate 2 cookies each day for 4 days, which is calculated as \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) cookies.
- **Total cookies**: The total number of cookies is the sum of the cookies eaten in both weeks, \( 10 + 8 = 18 \).

Now, we evaluate the given options to identify which expression correctly represents this situation:

1. **Option A: \( (5+4) \times 2 \)**  
   This simplifies to \( 9 \times 2 = 18 \), which matches the total number of cookies. It represents adding the days together first (\( 5+4 \)) and then multiplying by the number of cookies per day (2).

2. **Option C: \( 2 \times (5+4) \)**  
   This also simplifies to \( 2 \times 9 = 18 \), which is mathematically equivalent to Option A. It represents factoring out the common factor (2 cookies per day) and then adding the days together.

Both options A and C are mathematically correct and yield the same result. However, the problem asks for the expression that represents the total number of cookies Paul ate in these two weeks. Since the situation involves eating 2 cookies per day over separate weeks, the expression \( 2 \times (5+4) \) (Option C) is more appropriate because it explicitly factors out the common rate (2 cookies per day) and combines the days, aligning with the structure of the problem.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**C**
