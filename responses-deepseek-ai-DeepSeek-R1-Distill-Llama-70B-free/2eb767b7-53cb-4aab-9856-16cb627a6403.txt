Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given a random sample of size 16 from a normal distribution with mean 77 and variance 25. I need to find the probability that the sample mean, X bar, is between 77 and 79.5. The options are given from A to J.

Hmm, right. So, the first thing I remember is that when dealing with the sample mean from a normal distribution, the distribution of the sample mean is also normal. The mean of the sample mean should be the same as the population mean, which is 77 here. But the variance of the sample mean is the population variance divided by the sample size. Oh wait, variance is 25, so the standard deviation is 5 because sqrt(25) is 5.

So the population has mean μ=77 and standard deviation σ=5. The sample size n is 16. Then, the sample mean X̄ has a normal distribution with mean μ_X̄ = 77 and standard deviation σ_X̄ = σ / sqrt(n). Let me calculate that: sqrt(16) is 4, so σ_X̄ is 5/4 which is 1.25.

I need to find P(77 < X̄ < 79.5). Since X̄ is normally distributed, I can convert this into Z-scores and use the standard normal distribution table.

The formula for Z is (X̄ - μ) / (σ_X̄). So for X̄ =77, Z = (77 -77)/(1.25) = 0. That's the lower bound. For X̄=79.5, Z = (79.5-77)/1.25. Let's compute that: 79.5 minus 77 is 2.5, divided by 1.25. So 2.5 /1.25 is 2. So the Z-scores are 0 and 2.

Now, I need to find the probability that Z is between 0 and 2. That's the area under the standard normal curve from 0 to 2. From what I remember, the standard normal distribution table gives the cumulative probability from the left up to a certain Z value.

So P(0 < Z < 2) is equal to P(Z < 2) minus P(Z < 0). 

Looking up Z=2 in the table, the cumulative probability is about 0.9772. And P(Z<0) is 0.5 because the normal distribution is symmetric around 0. So subtracting, 0.9772 - 0.5 = 0.4772.

Wait, but let me double-check the Z values. Oh wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Because X̄ is 79.5, so the Z calculation is correct.

Wait, another thought: sometimes tables give the area to the left, which is correct here. So if Z is 2, the area to the left is 0.9772, and Z=0 is 0.5. So the area between them is indeed 0.4772.

Looking at the options, option I is 0.4772. So the answer should be I.

To solve the problem, we start by noting that the sample mean \( \bar{X} \) of a random sample from a normal distribution \( N(77, 25) \) is also normally distributed. The mean of \( \bar{X} \) is the same as the population mean, \( \mu = 77 \), and its standard deviation is \( \sigma_{\bar{X}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{5}{\sqrt{16}} = 1.25 \).

We need to compute \( P(77 < \bar{X} < 79.5) \). Converting these bounds into Z-scores using the formula \( Z = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sigma_{\bar{X}}} \):

- For \( \bar{X} = 77 \), \( Z = \frac{77 - 77}{1.25} = 0 \).
- For \( \bar{X} = 79.5 \), \( Z = \frac{79.5 - 77}{1.25} = 2 \).

Thus, we need \( P(0 < Z < 2) \), where \( Z \) follows the standard normal distribution. Using the standard normal distribution table:

- \( P(Z < 2) = 0.9772 \),
- \( P(Z < 0) = 0.5 \).

The probability \( P(0 < Z < 2) \) is therefore \( 0.9772 - 0.5 = 0.4772 \).

From the given options, the correct answer is **I: 0.4772**.
