Question:

A homeowner was injured when an automatic cutoff switch failed to function on a snowblower he was using. The cutoff switch had functioned well for a year after he purchased the snowblower but failed after the machine had been improperly repaired by a mechanic. The snowblower's operating manual contained a clear and prominent warning against making the very alteration to the switch mechanism that was made by the mechanic. The mechanic, however, did not have a manual available when he repaired the snowblower. Does the homeowner have a viable claim against the manufacturer of the snowblower for damages?

Options:

A: Yes, because the manufacturer should have made the manual available to repair personnel.
B: Yes, because the snowblower should have had a backup safety system in place.
C: No, because the injury resulted from a substantial alteration of the snowblower by a third party. a third party.
D: No, because the mechanic is solely responsible for the improper repair.
E: No, because the homeowner was contributorily negligent in failing to furnish the snowblower's manual to the mechanic.
F: No, because the homeowner should have ensured the mechanic had access to the correct manual.
G: Yes, because a defect in the snowblower caused the homeowner's injury.
H: Yes, because the cutoff switch should not have failed regardless of the repair.
I: Yes, because the manufacturer should have made the switch mechanism more robust.
J: No, because the homeowner should have requested a professional repair from the manufacturer.

Okay, so I've got this question about product liability, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's break it down step by step. 

The scenario is that a homeowner was injured when an automatic cutoff switch on his snowblower failed. The switch had worked fine for a year after purchase but failed after the machine was improperly repaired by a mechanic. The operating manual had a clear warning against making the exact alteration the mechanic did. However, the mechanic didn't have the manual available when he did the repair. The question is whether the homeowner can successfully sue the manufacturer for damages.

I remember that product liability cases often hinge on whether the product had a defect that made it unreasonably dangerous. There are three types of defects: manufacturing defects, design defects, and failure to warn defects. 

In this case, the cutoff switch failed after a repair. The key here is that the repair was done improperly, and the manual explicitly warned against that kind of alteration. But the mechanic didn't have the manual. So, who is liable?

So, the homeowner used the product as intended for a year without issues. The problem arose after a third party (the mechanic) made an alteration that the manual warned against. The manufacturer can't be expected to anticipate every possible way someone might misuse their product, especially if they provided adequate warnings.

Wait, but the manufacturer's warning was in the manual, which the mechanic didn't have. Does that mean the manufacturer failed to warn? Or is the onus on the homeowner to ensure that anyone repairing the product has the manual?

I think the general rule is that manufacturers must provide adequate warnings. If the warning is in the manual provided to the purchaser, that's usually sufficient. The manufacturer isn't required to ensure that every possible repair person has the manual. So if the mechanic didn't have it, that's not the manufacturer's fault.

Also, under the theory of "crashworthiness" or "avoidable consequences," the user has a duty to avoid increasing the risk of harm. If the mechanic's alteration was the cause of the failure, and the manual clearly warned against it, then the manufacturer might not be liable because the defect was introduced by a third party.

Looking at the options:

Option C says no because the injury resulted from a substantial alteration by a third party. That seems to fit because the mechanic's improper repair, which the manual warned against, caused the failure.

Option D says no because the mechanic is solely responsible. That might be true, but the question is about the manufacturer's liability, not necessarily the mechanic's. So even if the mechanic is at fault, the manufacturer could still be liable if they were also negligent.

Option E says no because the homeowner was contributorily negligent for not giving the manual to the mechanic. Contributory negligence can bar recovery in some states, but this varies. However, the question is about whether the claim is viable, not whether it's barred by contributory negligence. But I'm not sure if that's the main issue here.

Option A suggests the manufacturer should have made the manual available to repair personnel. But manufacturers typically don't have to ensure that all possible repair services have the manual. They provide it with the product, and it's up to the owner to use it.

So, probably the correct answer is C: No, because the injury resulted from a substantial alteration by a third party. The manufacturer isn't liable because the product was altered contrary to their warnings, and that alteration caused the injury.
</think>

The case revolves around whether the manufacturer can be held liable for the homeowner's injury, which occurred after a third-party mechanic improperly repaired the snowblower. The key issue is the improper alteration of the cutoff switch mechanism, which the manufacturer's manual explicitly warned against. The mechanic, however, did not have access to the manual during the repair.

Under product liability law, manufacturers are generally not required to ensure that all third-party repair personnel have access to the product's manual. The provision of clear warnings in the manual provided to the purchaser is typically sufficient to fulfill the duty to warn. The improper alteration by the mechanic, despite the warning, constitutes a substantial change to the product that the manufacturer could not reasonably foresee or prevent. This breaks the chain of causation between any alleged defect and the injury, absolving the manufacturer of liability.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option C** correctly identifies that the injury resulted from a substantial alteration by a third party, making the manufacturer not liable.
- **Option D** focuses on the mechanic's sole responsibility, but the question concerns the manufacturer's liability, not the mechanic's.
- **Option E** suggests contributory negligence by the homeowner, but this is not the primary issue in determining the manufacturer's liability.
- Other options either misapply legal principles or fail to address the critical factor of the third-party alteration.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**C: No, because the injury resulted from a substantial alteration of the snowblower by a third party.**
