Question:

A land development company was the owner of a400-acre tract of land in the Great Lakes region. Over the course of time, the land development company developed two residential subdivisions of the land, an eastern development and a western development, each of which contained 150 acres. These subdivisions were created by separate plats that made no reference to each other. The restrictions in the plats were, however, substantially identical. The plats and each deed provided that "the use of the land herein conveyed is restricted to single- family dwellings only, and this covenant is intended to apply to each and every lot in the subdivision and runs with the land, binding every lot owner, his heirs, and assigns. "After all but four lots in each subdivision had been sold by the land development company, it sold 50 acres of the remaining 100 acres of land to a country club by a deed containing the following provisions:"This deed is executed and accepted with the understanding that the property above described is hereby restricted so that(1) said property may be used as a country club, with a golf course, pool, tennis courts, club house, eating facilities, and other improvements appropriate to a country club. (2) said property may also be subdivided and platted as a residential subdivision similar to the eastern development and the property shall thereafter be used in accordance with and conveyed subject to residential restrictions that shall conform with those restrictions in force against the eastern development. (3) the restrictions herein contained shall be deemed covenants running with the land, and for breach of any covenant herein, grantor  land development company, its successors and assigns may, at its option, re-enter and terminate the estate conveyed hereby. "At the time of this conveyance, the land development company retained title to the remaining 50 acres in the original 400-acre tract. Which of the following would best describe the country club's interest in the SO-acre tract that it purchased from the land development company?

Options:

A: Easement appurtenant.
B: Fee simple subject to executory limitation.
C: Leasehold estate.
D: Fee simple absolute.
E: Remainder interest.
F: Determinable fee subject to an executory interest.
G: Fee simple subject to condition subsequent.
H: Fee simple determinable.
I: Life estate pur autre vie.
J: Fee simple defeasible.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about property law, specifically dealing with covenants running with the land and the type of estate created. Hmm, let me break it down step by step.

First, the setup: A land development company owns 400 acres and divides it into two residential subdivisions, each 150 acres. They sold lots in these subdivisions with deeds that include a restriction: "the use... is restricted to single-family dwellings only," and this covenant runs with the land. So each lot in the eastern and western developments is subject to this restriction.

Then, after selling most of the lots, the company sells 50 acres to a country club. The deed has some specific provisions. Let me read those carefully.

Provision (1) allows the property to be used as a country club with various facilities. So that's the primary use. 

Provision (2) says the country club may subdivide and plat the land as a residential subdivision similar to the eastern one, and then the property will be subject to the same residential restrictions as the eastern development. So, if they subdivide, those new lots will have the same single-family home restrictions.

Provision (3) states that these restrictions are covenants running with the land. Also, if there's a breach, the grantor (the land company) has the right to "re-enter and terminate the estate." That sounds like a right of entry or a condition subsequent.

So, the question is asking about the country club's interest in the 50-acre tract. The options are various types of estates, so I need to figure out what kind of estate this is.

I remember that when a deed includes a condition that allows the grantor to re-enter and terminate the estate upon a breach, it's a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent. Alternatively, if the condition is that upon a certain event, the estate automatically terminates, that's a determinable fee.

Looking at the deed, the grantor (land company) can choose to re-enter and terminate the estate if there's a breach. That's a right of entry, which is a condition subsequent. So the estate is a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent.

Wait, but the options include other possibilities too. Let me make sure.

Option G is "Fee simple subject to condition subsequent." That fits because the grantor can choose to exercise the right of entry if the country club breaches the covenant.

Alternatively, option F is "Determinable fee subject to executory interest," but a determinable fee would have an automatic termination upon a condition, without the grantor having to take action. Here, the grantor has an option, so it's conditional subsequent, not determinable.

So the country club has a fee simple estate, but it's defeasible because there's a condition under which it can be taken back. Wait, another thought: "Fee simple defeasible" is a broader category that includes both condition subsequent and determinable fees. Option J is "Fee simple defeasible," which is a possibility.

But I think the more specific answer would be G, because the condition is subsequent. The grantor must take action to terminate the estate, which is the hallmark of a condition subsequent.

Wait, the deed says "may, at its option, re-enter and terminate." So it's not automatic; the grantor has the option. So that's a condition subsequent, meaning the estate is a fee simple subject to condition subsequent.

So the correct answer should be G.

Wait, but let me look back at the options.

Option F: Determinable fee subject to executory limitation. No, because that's when the estate automatically ends upon a condition, like "so long as..." which creates a possibility of reverter, not an executory interest.

Option J is "Fee simple defeasible," which is a broader term. But the question asks for the best description. Since the condition is subsequent, G is more precise.

So I think G is the correct answer.

The country club's interest in the 50-acre tract is determined by analyzing the deed provisions and the type of estate created. The deed allows the country club to use the property as a country club and grants the option to subdivide it into a residential subdivision, provided it conforms to the restrictions of the eastern development. Importantly, the deed includes a condition that allows the grantor (the land development company) to "re-enter and terminate the estate" upon a breach of the covenants. This language indicates a **condition subsequent**, as the grantor must take action to terminate the estate, rather than the estate automatically terminating upon a specific event (which would characterize a **determinable fee**).

Given this, the country club holds a **fee simple subject to a condition subsequent**, as the grantor retains the right to re-enter and terminate the estate if the covenants are breached. This is the most precise description of the country club's interest.

**Answer: G**
