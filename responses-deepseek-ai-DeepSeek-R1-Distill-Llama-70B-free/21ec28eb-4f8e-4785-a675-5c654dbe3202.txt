Question:

Which of the following is NOT true about the difference between traditional research and program evaluation?

Options:

A: Program evaluation uses unique quantitative and qualitative methodologies to collect data. These methods are different from those that are used in traditional research.
B: Traditional research and program evaluation have different aims. Traditional research aims to test existing theories and discover generalizable knowledge, while program evaluation aims to collect information important for timely decision-making.
C: Both traditional research and program evaluation may incorporate rigorous and systematic ways of collecting data in order to address their aims.
D: Program evaluation questions are often identified through the needs of a programâ€™s staff and stakeholders, while traditional research questions are identified by researchers using previous, existing research.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me about the differences between traditional research and program evaluation. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which statement is NOT true about their differences. The options are A through D. Let me try to remember what I know about each.

First, I recall that traditional research is more about generating new knowledge and testing theories. It's usually broader, aiming for generalizable results. On the other hand, program evaluation is more applied. It's about assessing the effectiveness of a specific program, providing information to decision-makers so they can improve the program or decide whether to continue or expand it.

Looking at option A: It says that program evaluation uses unique methodologies different from traditional research. Wait, does program evaluation really have its own unique methods, or does it use similar methods but in a different context? I think program evaluators use both quantitative and qualitative methods, just like traditional research. They might use surveys, interviews, observations, etc., but the purpose is different. So maybe option A is incorrect because they don't use unique methods, just apply the same methods for different goals. That would mean A is NOT true, making it the correct answer to the question.

Option B: It states that traditional research aims to test theories and discover generalizable knowledge, while program evaluation is for timely decision-making. That sounds right. Traditional research is more about contributing to the body of knowledge, while evaluations are more practical and time-sensitive. So B is true, so it's not the answer.

Option C: Both use rigorous and systematic data collection. That makes sense. Both fields value systematic approaches to ensure reliability and validity. So C is a true statement, meaning it's not the answer we're looking for.

Option D: Evaluation questions come from program staff and stakeholders, while research questions come from existing research. That rings a bell. Evaluations are often driven by the needs of the people involved in the program, so the questions are practical and based on their needs. Researchers often identify their questions based on gaps in existing literature. So D is true, not the answer.

So putting it all together, the statement that is NOT true is option A because both fields use similar methodologies; the difference lies in their goals and applications, not the methods themselves.

The question asks which statement is NOT true about the differences between traditional research and program evaluation. 

- **Option A** claims that program evaluation uses unique methodologies different from traditional research. This is incorrect because both fields use similar quantitative and qualitative methods (e.g., surveys, interviews) but apply them for different purposes. The difference lies in their goals, not the methods themselves.
- **Option B** correctly states that traditional research aims to test theories and generate generalizable knowledge, while program evaluation focuses on providing timely, practical information for decision-making.
- **Option C** accurately notes that both fields use rigorous and systematic data collection methods to achieve their respective goals.
- **Option D** correctly identifies that evaluation questions often stem from program staff and stakeholders, whereas research questions typically arise from existing literature.

The statement that is NOT true is **Option A**, as the methodologies used in both fields are not inherently unique but are applied differently based on their objectives.

Answer: A
