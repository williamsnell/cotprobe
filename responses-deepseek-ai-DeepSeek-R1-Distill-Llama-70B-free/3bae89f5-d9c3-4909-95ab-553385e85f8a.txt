Question:

Describe a procedure that can be used to determine inventory turnover rate.

Options:

A: Inventory turnover rate is calculated by dividing total sales by ending inventory.
B: Inventory turnover rate is calculated by dividing total sales by average inventory.
C: Inventory turnover rate is calculated by subtracting the cost of goods sold from the average inventory.
D: Inventory turnover rate is determined by adding the cost of goods sold to the ending inventory.
E: Inventory turnover rate is found by dividing average inventory by the cost of goods sold.
F: Inventory turnover rate is calculated by dividing the beginning inventory by the cost of goods sold.
G: Inventory turnover rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the beginning and ending inventory by the cost of goods sold.
H: The inventory turnover rate can be calculated by dividing the cost of goods sold by the average inventory.
I: Inventory turnover rate is calculated by multiplying the cost of goods sold by the average inventory.
J: The inventory turnover rate is found by subtracting the average inventory from the total sales.

Okay, so I've got this question about inventory turnover rate, and I'm a bit rusty on my accounting terms, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what inventory turnover means. From what I remember, inventory turnover is a measure of how many times a company sells and replaces its inventory within a given period. It's like how quickly the stock is moving.

Now, the question is asking about the procedure to determine the inventory turnover rate. I think the formula involves the cost of goods sold (COGS) and some measure of inventory. I remember that COGS is a key component here because it represents the cost of producing goods that were sold. 

Wait, I think the formula might be COGS divided by average inventory. Because average inventory makes sense since it smooths out any fluctuations during the period. Let me think: if you just use ending inventory, it might not give an accurate picture because inventory levels can vary throughout the year. So average inventory, which is usually calculated as (beginning inventory + ending inventory) / 2, would be more accurate.

So putting it together, the formula should be COGS divided by average inventory. Let me look at the options. 

Option H says it's calculated by dividing COGS by average inventory. That sounds right. Let me check the other options to make sure I'm not mixing anything up.

Option A is total sales divided by ending inventory. Hmm, I don't think so because I remember COGS is used, not sales. Plus, ending inventory alone might not be the best measure. 

Option B is total sales over average inventory. No, that doesn't fit because it's COGS, not sales. 

Option E is average inventory divided by COGS. Oh, that's the inverse of what I think it should be. So that would give a different ratio. 

Option I is multiplying COGS by average inventory. That would give a much larger number, which doesn't make sense for a turnover rate. 

So yes, the correct formula is COGS divided by average inventory, which matches option H. That must be the right answer.

The inventory turnover rate is a measure of how efficiently a company sells and replaces its inventory. It is calculated by dividing the cost of goods sold (COGS) by the average inventory. This formula is accurate because COGS represents the cost of goods sold during the period, and average inventory, calculated as (beginning inventory + ending inventory) / 2, provides a smoothed measure of inventory levels. 

Analyzing the options, the correct choice is:

H: The inventory turnover rate can be calculated by dividing the cost of goods sold by the average inventory.

Other options are incorrect because they either use the wrong numerator (e.g., total sales instead of COGS), the wrong denominator (e.g., ending inventory instead of average inventory), or inverse/multiply the components, which does not align with the standard formula.

Answer: H
