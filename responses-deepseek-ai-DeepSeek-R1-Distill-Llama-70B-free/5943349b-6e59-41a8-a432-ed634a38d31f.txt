Okay, so I have this question about social development during adolescence, and I need to figure out the correct answer from the options given. Let me start by recalling what I know about adolescence and its social aspects.

Adolescence is the stage between childhood and adulthood, roughly from ages 12 to 18. I remember that during this time, teenagers go through a lot of changes, both physically and socially. One of the key things I learned is that they start seeking more independence from their parents. They begin to form their own identities, which is a concept I think Erik Erikson talked about. He mentioned something about identity vs. role confusion as one of the stages.

So, in terms of social development, adolescents typically start to rely more on their peers. They form close relationships with friends, and peer acceptance becomes really important. I've heard that teenagers often experiment with different roles and might go through various phases as they try to figure out who they are. This probably includes trying different social groups or activities to see where they fit in.

Looking at the options, let me go through each one:

Option A: Lesser focus on self-discovery and role experimentation. Wait, no, I think it's the opposite. Adolescents are more focused on self-discovery, so this option doesn't seem right.

Option B: Increased social isolation and withdrawal. Hmm, I don't think that's correct. While some might go through phases, overall, adolescents tend to be more social and seek peer interaction, not isolate.

Option C: More reliance on parents. No, I think they rely less on parents and more on peers as they seek independence.

Option D: Declining interest in establishing an identity. No, that's the opposite. They are trying to establish their identity, so interest increases.

Option E: Increased independence from peers. Wait, no. Adolescents usually become more influenced by peers, not less. They might seek independence from parents, but from peers? Probably not.

Option F: Heightened parental influence and reduced peer interaction. That doesn't sound right. Parental influence probably decreases, while peer influence increases.

Option G: Reduced importance of peer acceptance. No, peer acceptance becomes more important, not less. Teens often care a lot about what their peers think.

Option H: Focus on academic success. Well, school is important, but the question is about social development. So H might not directly address the social aspects unless specified. But I'm not sure if this is the best option.

Option I: Decreased ability to form close relationships. No, I think their ability increases as they learn to form deeper, more meaningful relationships with peers.

Option J: Increased importance of social skills, less reliance on parents, and more reliance on peers. This sounds right. Adolescents develop better social skills, become less dependent on their parents, and start relying more on their friends for support and validation.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be J.

The correct answer is J: increased importance of social skills, less reliance on parents, and more reliance on peers.
