Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

What is the source of the material that causes meteor showers?

Options:

A: Near-Earth asteroids gradually disintegrate and spread out along their orbital path. When the Earth passes through the orbit of an asteroid we are bombarded by sand-sized particles which cause a meteor shower.
B: The nuclei of comets gradually disintegrate and spread out along the comet's orbital path. When the Earth passes through the orbit of a comet we are bombarded by sand-sized particles which cause a meteor shower.
C: Meteor showers are caused by the disintegration of the Oort Cloud, a theoretical cloud of predominantly icy planetesimals proposed to surround the Sun.
D: The nuclei of comets disintigrate as they enter Earth's atmosphere creating hundreds of bright meteors that appear to radiate from a central location in the sky.
E: Near-Earth asteroids disintegrate as they enter Earth's atmosphere creating hundreds of bright meteors that appear to radiate from a single location in the sky.
F: The material causing meteor showers comes from the dust and debris left behind by passing UFOs.
G: Meteor showers are caused by the disintegration of space junk, or man-made debris in space, as it enters the Earth's atmosphere.
H: Meteor showers are caused by the disintegration of asteroids within the Earth's atmosphere, resulting in a barrage of tiny, bright meteors.
I: Meteor showers occur when Earth passes through the path of a disintegrated planet, causing a bombardment of various-sized particles.
J: Meteor showers are caused by the disintegration of the Earth's moon, due to extreme temperature variations, creating debris that enters the Earth's atmosphere.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about meteor showers and their source. Hmm, I remember that meteor showers happen when Earth passes through a trail of debris, right? But wait, where does that debris come from?

Let me think. I've heard that comets and asteroids can both leave behind trails. Comets are icy bodies that release dust and particles as they approach the Sun. Asteroids are more rocky and might not produce as much debris. So when a comet's orbit brings it close to the Sun, it starts to disintegrate, leaving a path of small particles.

When Earth's orbit intersects with this path, we pass through the comet's debris. These tiny particles enter our atmosphere at high speeds, burning up and creating the bright streaks we call meteors. So the material causing meteor showers is likely from comets.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's from near-Earth asteroids. I think that's not the primary source. Most meteor showers are linked to comets, not asteroids.

Option B says the nuclei of comets disintegrate and spread particles along their orbit. That sounds right. When Earth passes through, we get the meteor shower.

Option C mentions the Oort Cloud. The Oort Cloud is where comets come from, but the material itself causing the shower is from the comet, not the cloud directly.

Option D says comet nuclei disintegrate as they enter Earthâ€™s atmosphere. No, that's not it. The comet's particles are already spread along the orbit, not the comet entering Earth's atmosphere.

Option E is about asteroids entering the atmosphere. Again, probably not the main cause.

Options F through J don't seem right. F is UFOs, which isn't scientific. G is space junk, which I don't think causes meteor showers. H is about asteroids disintegrating in the atmosphere, which isn't the main source. I is about a disintegrated planet, which I haven't heard of. J is the Moon breaking apart, which doesn't make sense as the Moon isn't disintegrating.

So the correct answer should be option B.

The material causing meteor showers comes from the debris left behind by comets. As comets approach the Sun, their icy nuclei disintegrate, spreading dust and particles along their orbital paths. When Earth passes through these trails of debris, the particles enter our atmosphere, creating the bright streaks known as meteors. This aligns with option B, which correctly identifies comets as the source.

Answer: B
