Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about spaceships and velocities. Hmm, I remember something about special relativity from my classes. Let me try to think through this step by step.

So the question says a spaceship is moving away from Earth at a velocity v1 = 0.75c. Then, this spaceship launches a rocket in the same direction (away from Earth), and the rocket's velocity is V2 = 0.75c with respect to the spaceship. I need to find the rocket's velocity relative to Earth.

Wait, right, I think this isn't just a matter of adding the velocities. Because in classical mechanics, velocities add up directly, but according to Einstein's theory, when things are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just add them like that. Oh yeah, I remember something about the velocity addition formula in special relativity.

So the formula must be used here. I think the formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²). Let me make sure I have that right. Yeah, I think that's correct. So u is the velocity of the object in the frame where the spaceship is at rest, and v is the velocity of the spaceship relative to Earth. So in this case, u would be V2, which is 0.75c, and v is v1, also 0.75c.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. Let me get this straight. The rocket's velocity relative to Earth is what we're looking for. So the spaceship is moving at v1 = 0.75c away from Earth. The rocket, when launched, is moving at V2 = 0.75c relative to the spaceship. So according to the spaceship's frame, the rocket is moving at 0.75c in the same direction. So I need to compute the rocket's speed as observed from Earth.

So using the formula, u' would be the rocket's speed relative to Earth. So u is the rocket's speed in the spaceship's frame, which is 0.75c, and v is the spaceship's speed relative to Earth, which is also 0.75c.

Plugging into the formula: u' = (0.75c + 0.75c) / (1 + (0.75c * 0.75c)/c² )

Wait, let's compute the numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 0.75c + 0.75c = 1.5c.

Denominator: 1 + (0.75 * 0.75) because the c² in the denominator cancels with the c² from the numerator. So 0.75 * 0.75 is 0.5625. So the denominator becomes 1 + 0.5625 = 1.5625.

So u' = (1.5c) / 1.5625.

Let me compute 1.5 / 1.5625. Hmm, 1.5 divided by 1.5625. Let me think. 1.5 is the same as 3/2, and 1.5625 is 25/16. So 3/2 divided by 25/16 is (3/2) * (16/25) = (3 * 16) / (2 *25) = (48)/(50) = 24/25, which is 0.96.

So u' is 0.96c.

Looking at the options, option H is 0.96c. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but let me double-check. Sometimes I might mix up the formula. Oh wait, another thing to consider: the formula u' = (u + v)/(1 + uv/c²) is correct when both velocities are in the same direction. So yes, the spaceship is moving away, the rocket is moving away from the spaceship, so both are in the same direction relative to Earth.

Alternatively, I could have thought about this as each velocity being 3/4 c, and using the formula, which gives 24/25 c, which is 0.96c.

So yes, the correct answer is H.
</think>

To determine the velocity of the rocket with respect to Earth, we must use the velocity addition formula from special relativity:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( u \) is the velocity of the rocket relative to the spaceship, \( u = 0.75c \),
- \( v \) is the velocity of the spaceship relative to Earth, \( v = 0.75c \).

Substituting these values into the formula:

1. **Numerator**: \( u + v = 0.75c + 0.75c = 1.5c \),
2. **Denominator**: \( 1 + \frac{uv}{c^2} = 1 + \frac{(0.75c)(0.75c)}{c^2} = 1 + 0.5625 = 1.5625 \).

Thus:

\[
u' = \frac{1.5c}{1.5625} = 0.96c
\]

This means the velocity of the rocket with respect to Earth is \( 0.96c \). Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**H: 0.96c**

Answer: H
