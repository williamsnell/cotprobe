Okay, I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. So, the question is about sound waves and displacement amplitudes. Let me try to break it down.

The question has two parts, a) and b). Both seem related to finding the maximum displacement amplitude of a sound wave in air under different pressure variations. I'll start with part a.

Part a says the maximum pressure variation P is 28 Pa, and the frequency is 1000 Hz. I remember that the displacement amplitude of a sound wave is related to the pressure amplitude, frequency, and some other properties of air. Hmm, I think the formula connects pressure amplitude (P), displacement amplitude (ξ), frequency (f), air density (ρ), and the speed of sound (v).

Wait, right. The pressure amplitude P is related to the displacement amplitude ξ by the equation P = ρ * v * ω * ξ. Oh wait, ω is the angular frequency, which is 2πf. So the formula becomes P = ρ * v * 2πf * ξ.

I need to solve for ξ. So ξ = P / (ρ * v * 2πf).

But wait, what values do I use for ρ and v? The problem doesn't give them, so I must remember or assume standard values. I think the density of air is about 1.2 kg/m³, and the speed of sound in air is approximately 343 m/s at room temperature.

Let me plug in the numbers. P is 28 Pa. So:

ξ = 28 / (1.2 * 343 * 2π * 1000)

Let me compute the denominator first. 1.2 * 343 = let's see, 1.2 * 300 is 360, 1.2 * 43 is 51.6, so total 411.6. Then multiply by 2π*1000.

Wait, 2π is about 6.2832. So 6.2832 * 1000 = 6283.2. Now multiply that by 411.6:

411.6 * 6283.2. Hmm, that's a big number. Let me approximate. 400 * 6000 is 2,400,000. So 411.6 * 6283 is roughly 2,588,000 (exact calculation may vary but I can compute it more accurately).

Wait, perhaps I should compute it step by step. 1.2 kg/m³, 343 m/s, 2π*1000 Hz = 6283.19 rad/s.

So denominator: 1.2 * 343 = 411.6; 411.6 * 6283.19 ≈ let's calculate 411.6 * 6283.

I'll compute 411.6 * 6283:

411.6 * 6000 = 2,469,600
411.6 * 283 = let's compute 411.6 * 200 = 82,320; 411.6 * 80 = 32,928; 411.6 *3=1,234.8. Sum these: 82,320 +32,928 = 115,248 +1,234.8=116,482.8.

So total denominator is 2,469,600 + 116,482.8 = 2,586,082.8.

So denominator ≈ 2,586,083.

So ξ = 28 / 2,586,083 ≈ let's compute that.

28 divided by 2.586e6. Let me see, 28 / 2.586e6 = approx 0.00001082 meters. Because 1e-6 is a millionth, so 0.00001082 m is 1.082e-5 m. Wait, 1.08e-5 meters is 1.08 × 10^-5 m. Looking at the options, part a is the first value. Let's check the options.

Options for part a and b: the first part of each option is for part a, the second for part b. So looking at the options:

Option A: 3e-5, 1e-9
Option B: 1.5e-5, 1e-10
Option C: 2e-5, 1e-10
Option D: 0.8e-5, 1e-13
Option E: 0.9e-5, 1e-14
Option F: 1.2e-5, 1e-8
Option G: 1.1e-5, 1e-11
Option H: 2.1e-5, 1e-12
Option I: 2.3e-5, 1e-9
Option J: 1.4e-5, 1e-12

Wait, my calculation for part a gives about 1.08e-5 m. Looking at the options, the closest is option G (1.1e-5) for part a. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because that's not matching the options I see.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator. Let me re-calculate the denominator.

Wait, the denominator is ρ * v * 2πf.

ρ = 1.2 kg/m³
v = 343 m/s
f = 1000 Hz.

So 2πf = 6283.185307 radians per second.

So denominator: 1.2 * 343 * 6283.185 ≈ let me compute 1.2 * 343 first.

1.2 * 343 = (1 * 343) + (0.2 * 343) = 343 + 68.6 = 411.6.

Then 411.6 * 6283.185. Let me compute 411.6 * 6000 = 2,469,600, 411.6 * 283.185 ≈ 411.6 * 283. Let's compute 400 * 283 = 113,200, 11.6 * 283 = approx 3,285. So total 113,200 + 3,285 = 116,485.

So 2,469,600 + 116,485 = 2,586,085.

So denominator is about 2,586,085.

Then P is 28 Pa.

ξ = 28 / 2,586,085 ≈ let's compute 28 / 2.586e6.

28 divided by 2.586e6 is approximately 0.00001082 m, which is 1.082e-5 m, or 1.08e-5 m.

Looking back at the options, the closest is option G, which has 1.1e-5 m for part a. But wait, option J is 1.4e-5. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculation somewhere.

Wait another approach: perhaps I should express the formula correctly. Wait, is P equal to ρ v ω ξ, or is there another factor?

Wait, another formula comes to mind: the relationship between sound pressure and displacement amplitude. The formula is P = (ρ v ω) * ξ. So that should be correct.

Wait, but I've heard another formula, P = (v ω) * (ρ ξ). Or perhaps I'm mixing up something. Alternatively, maybe the formula is P = (z) * v * ω * ξ, where z is the impedance, and z = ρ v.

Yes, that makes sense. Because the impedance z is ρ v. So P = z v ω ξ? Wait, no, I think P = ρ v ω ξ.

Wait another thought: maybe the formula is P = (ρ v ω²) * ξ? No, that doesn't make sense because the units wouldn't match. Let me think about the units.

Pressure P is in Pascals (N/m²). Displacement ξ is in meters. Let's see:

ρ is kg/m³, v is m/s. ω is rad/s (1/s). So ρ * v * ω has units kg/(m³) * m/s * 1/s = kg/(m³ s²) * m/s * s? Wait, no.

Wait, better to compute the units:

( kg/m³ ) * ( m/s ) * ( 1/s ) = kg/(m² s²) → which is equivalent to (kg m)/(s² m²) ) → kg/(m s²). Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, let me think about the formula in terms of force per unit area.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the speed of sound, v = sqrt( (γ P0)/ρ ), where P0 is atmospheric pressure and γ is the adiabatic index. But that might not be directly helpful here.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The displacement amplitude ξ is related to the pressure amplitude P by the equation ξ = P/(ρ v ω). So yeah, as I had before.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation again.

Compute denominator: 1.2 kg/m³ * 343 m/s = 411.6 kg/(m² s). Multiply by ω = 2π * 1000 Hz = 6283.19 rad/s.

So 411.6 * 6283.19 ≈ let me compute 411.6 * 6e3 = 2.4696e6, 411.6 * 283.19 ≈ let's say approximately 411.6*283 ≈ 411*283. 400*283=113200, 11*283=3113 → sum 116,313. So total denominator is approx 2,469,600 + 116,313 = 2,585,913.

So 28 / 2,585,913 ≈ 28 / 2.585e6 = approx 0.00001082 m, which is 1.082e-5 m.

Looking at the options, the closest is option G: 1.1e-5. But wait, looking again, option J is 1.4e-5. Hmm, perhaps I made an error in the calculation. Let me compute 411.6 *6283.19 exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values for ρ or v. Maybe the speed of sound is taken as 340 m/s instead of 343? Let me try that.

If v = 340 m/s, then 1.2 * 340 = 408. Then 408 * 6283.19 = ?

408 * 6000 = 2,448,000, 408 * 283.19 ≈ 408 * 280 = 114,240, 408 *3.19≈ 1,300. So 114,240 +1,300 = 115,540. So total denominator 2,448,000 +115,540 = 2,563,540.

So P is 28 Pa. ξ = 28 / 2,563,540 ≈ approx 0.00001092 m → 1.092e-5 m, which is about 1.09e-5 m. Still close to 1.1e-5, which would match option G's first part (1.1e-5 for part a). But looking back, option G's part a is 1.1e-5, and part b is 1e-11.

Wait, but let me check part b as well. Maybe that will help in choosing the correct option.

Part b: The pressure amplitude is 2.0e-5 Pa. Using the same formula, ξ = P/(ρ v ω).

So same denominator as before, 2,563,540 when v=340, or 2.58e6 when v=343.

So ξ for part b is 2.0e-5 Pa / (same denominator as before). Let's compute that.

Using denominator 2.58e6 (v=343):

ξ = 2e-5 / 2.58e6 ≈ (2 / 2.58) * 1e-11 → approx 0.775 * 1e-11 → 7.75e-12 m.

But wait, let me compute it accurately.

Denominator for part a was 2.586e6.

So 2e-5 / 2.586e6 = (2 / 2.586) * 1e-11 → 2/2.586 ≈ 0.7736 → 0.7736e-11 → 7.736e-12 m.

Looking at the options, for part b, some options have 1e-10, 1e-11, etc.

So part a: ~1.09e-5 m, part b: ~7.7e-12 m.

Looking at the options, which have these values?

Option J: a)1.4e-5, b)1e-12. Hmm, not matching.

Option H: a)2.1e-5, b)1e-12. No.

Option G: a)1.1e-5, b)1e-11. Let me see, part a matches, part b is 1e-11, which is higher than our calculation of 7.7e-12.

Hmm. Let's see, did I make a mistake in part b's calculation.

Wait, part b's P is 2e-5 Pa. So ξ = P/(rho v omega).

Rho =1.2, v=343, omega=2pi*1000. So denominator same as before, 2.586e6.

So 2e-5 / 2.586e6 = 2e-5 / 2.586e6 → approximately 7.73e-12 m.

Looking at the options, the part b answers are:

A: 1e-9

B:1e-10

C:1e-10

D:1e-13

E:1e-14

F:1e-8

G:1e-11

H:1e-12

I:1e-9

J:1e-12

So for part b, the correct answer is approx 7.7e-12 → 7.7e-12 is 7.7 ×10^-12 m. Looking at the options, the closest is 1e-12, which is option H and J.

So for part a, we have around 1.08e-5 m, and part b around 7.7e-12.

Looking at the options:

Option J: a)1.4e-5, b)1e-12.

Wait, 1.4e-5 is higher than our calculated 1.08e-5. That's a bit off.

Option G: a)1.1e-5, b)1e-11. Hmm, but part b in option G is 1e-11, which is larger than our 7.7e-12.

Option H: a)2.1e-5, which is way higher than our 1.08e-5.

Wait, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me double-check. Maybe I inverted the formula.

Wait, the formula is ξ = P/(rho * v * omega). So yes, that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere. Because when I think about the relation between pressure and displacement in a sound wave, sometimes it's expressed using the wave number k, where k = omega /v. Because omega is 2pi f, and wave number k is 2pi / lambda.

So another approach: P = (rho v omega) * xi.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula P = (rho v^2) * (k xi), where k is wave number. Because the product k xi is dimensionless, so that might make sense.

Wait, let me think: the formula for pressure amplitude in a plane wave is P = (rho v^2) * k * xi.

Because, wave number k = omega / v = (2pi f)/v.

So substituting k into P:

P = rho v² (omega / v) xi → P = rho v omega xi.

Which is the same as before. So that formula is correct.

So, perhaps my earlier calculations are correct, and I should look for an option where part a is about 1.1e-5, and part b is about 7.7e-12.

Looking at the options, the only one that comes close is none of them exactly, but perhaps the closest is option J: a=1.4e-5, b=1e-12.

Wait, but my part a is 1.08e-5, and option G is 1.1e-5 for part a, part b is 1e-11. Hmm, but part b is 7.7e-12, so none match exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of rho or v. Let me try with rho =1.29 kg/m³, which is another value I've heard for air density.

So rho=1.29, v=343.

Denominator becomes 1.29 * 343 * 6283.19.

Compute 1.29 * 343: 1 * 343 =343, 0.29*343≈ 343*0.3=102.9, minus 343*0.01=3.43 → 102.9-3.43=99.47. So total 343+99.47=442.47.

Wait, 1.29 * 343: 343 * 1 = 343, 343 *0.29 = 343*(0.2 + 0.09) = 68.6 + 30.87 = 99.47. So total 442.47 kg/(m² s) ?

Wait, no, 1.29 kg/m³ * 343 m/s = 442.47 kg/(m² s).

Then multiply by 6283.19 rad/s: 442.47 * 6283.19 ≈ let's compute.

442.47 * 6e3 = 2,654,820.

442.47 * 283.19 ≈ 442 * 280 = 123,760, 442*3.19≈ 1,409. So total approximately 123,760 + 1,409 = 125,169.

So total denominator = 2,654,820 + 125,169 ≈ 2,779,989.

So for part a: ξ = 28 / 2.78e6 ≈ 0.00001007 m → 1.007e-5 m.

Hmm, that's about 1.007e-5 m for part a. So that's even closer to 1.0e-5. None of the options have this value.

Wait, maybe the speed of
