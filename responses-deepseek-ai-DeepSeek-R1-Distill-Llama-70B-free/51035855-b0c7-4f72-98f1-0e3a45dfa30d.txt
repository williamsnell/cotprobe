Okay, I need to figure out how many points a touchdown is worth in American football. I'm a bit new to the sport, so I'll try to remember what I've heard or read before. 

From what I recall, touchdowns are a big score in football. I think they're worth more than field goals. I remember that a field goal is three points, so a touchdown must be higher than that. 

I also remember that after a touchdown, the team can choose to kick an extra point, which is one point, or go for a two-point conversion, which would add an extra two points. But the touchdown itself is the main score. 

So, if the touchdown is the main part, I think it's worth six points. The extra point is just an addition, but the touchdown is the primary six. 

Looking at the options provided, option A is six. That must be the correct answer. Let me make sure I'm not mixing it up with other sports. In rugby, tries are worth five points, but that's a different sport altogether. 

Yes, I'm pretty confident now. The answer should be six points for a touchdown.
