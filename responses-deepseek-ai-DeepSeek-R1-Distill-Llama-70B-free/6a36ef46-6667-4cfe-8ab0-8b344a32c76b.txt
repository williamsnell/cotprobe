Okay, so I have this problem about finding the cutoff frequency of the first higher-order mode for an air-dielectric 50-ohm coaxial line. The inner conductor has a radius of 2 mm. Hmm, I remember that in coaxial cables, the dominant mode is the TEM mode, which doesn't have a cutoff frequency. But higher-order modes do have cutoff frequencies. The first higher-order mode is usually the TE or TM mode, but I'm not exactly sure which one comes first.

Wait, right, for coaxial cables, the first higher-order mode after TEM is the TE11 mode. Or was it TM? Oh, wait, in circular waveguides, the first higher mode after TEM is the TE11 mode. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact cutoff calculation.

I think the cutoff frequency (fc) is determined by the geometry of the coaxial line. The formula for cutoff frequency probably involves the speed of light and the radius of the inner conductor. Oh right, the cutoff frequency for the TE11 mode in a coaxial cable is given by a specific formula.

The formula I remember is fc = v * (β11) / (2πa), where a is the radius of the inner conductor. Wait, I might be mixing up something. Let me think again. Oh wait, I think the cutoff frequency for the first higher-order mode is when the wavelength is such that the mode can propagate. The cutoff occurs when the frequency is low enough that the mode cannot propagate anymore.

Another approach: The cutoff frequency for the first higher-order mode (TE11) in a coaxial cable is given by fc = c / (2π√(με)) * β, where β is the root of the derivative of the Bessel function J1, I think. Wait, I should look up the exact formula, but since I can't, I'll try to recall.

Wait, another formula comes to mind: fc = (1.84c) / (2πa), where a is the radius of the inner conductor, and 1.84 is the first root of the derivative of the Bessel function J1. Oh wait, wait, wait. Or is it J0? Because I remember that the cutoff for the dominant mode in a circular waveguide is determined by the first root of J0, which is about 2.4048. But for higher modes, like TE11, the roots are different.

Wait, no, in coaxial lines, it's a bit different. The cutoff frequency for the first higher-order mode (TE11) is given by fc = v_p * (x) / (2πa), where x is the root of J1', the derivative of the Bessel function of order 1. The first root of J1' is approximately 1.8412. So x is around 1.8412.

Wait, but let me get the formula correctly. For a coaxial cable, the cutoff frequency for the TE modes is given by fc = (v_p * x) / (2πa), where x is the nth root of J_m', where m is the mode type. For TE modes, m=1, so the first root is 1.8412.

But wait, what is v_p in this formula? Oh, v_p is the phase velocity in the medium. Since it's an air-dielectric coaxial line, the phase velocity is approximately the speed of light in vacuum, c = 3e8 m/s.

So plugging the numbers in: a is 2 mm, which is 0.002 meters. x is approximately 1.8412.

So fc = (3e8 m/s * 1.8412) / (2 * π * 0.002 m)

Let me compute this step by step.

First, calculate the denominator: 2 * π * 0.002. π is about 3.1416. So 2 * 3.1416 = 6.2832. Multiply by 0.002: 6.2832 * 0.002 = 0.0125664.

Now numerator: 3e8 * 1.8412 = 3e8 * 1.8412 = let's compute that. 3e8 is 300,000,000. Multiply by 1.8412: 300,000,000 * 1.8412 = 552,360,000,000.

Wait, 300 million times 1.8 is 540 million, 300 million times 0.0412 is about 12.36 million, so total around 552.36 million, which is 5.5236e+11.

So numerator is 5.5236e11, denominator is 0.0125664.

So fc = (5.5236e11) / 0.0125664.

Let me compute that division.

5.5236e11 / 0.0125664.

Let me think in terms of exponents.

5.5236e11 divided by 1.25664e-2.

Which is (5.5236 / 1.25664) * (1e11 / 1e-2) ) = (approx 4.394) * 1e13.

Wait, 1e11 divided by 1e-2 is 1e13, correct.

Wait, 5.5236 divided by 1.25664: Let me compute that.

5.5236 ÷ 1.25664.

Approximating:

1.25664 * 4 = 5.02656. Which is less than 5.5236.

5.5236 - 5.02656 = 0.497.

So 4 + 0.497 / 1.25664.

0.497 / 1.25664 ≈ 0.395.

So 4.395.

So fc ≈ 4.395e13 Hz.

Wait, 4.395e13 Hz is 43.95 terahertz? That doesn't make sense because the options are in GHz. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me redo the calculation.

Wait, a mistake must have happened because I think the cutoff frequency can't be that high for a 2 mm radius inner conductor.

Let me re-examine the formula.

Wait, perhaps I confused the formula. Another source says the cutoff frequency for the first higher-order mode in a coaxial cable is given by:

fc = (1.84) / (2π√(μϵ) * a)

Wait, no, let's think again. The general formula for cutoff frequency in a waveguide is:

fc = v_p * (x_mn) / (2πa)

But let's think about the units.

Wait, another approach: The cutoff wavelength λc is given by λc = 2πa / x, where x is the root of the Bessel function derivative. So the cutoff frequency is fc = c / λc.

Wait, that makes more sense. So λc = 2πa / x.

So fc = c / (2πa / x) ) = c * x / (2πa )

Which is the same formula I had earlier. So same calculation.

Wait, so for a=0.002 m, x=1.8412.

So fc = (3e8 m/s * 1.8412) / (2 * π * 0.002 m)

Compute numerator: 3e8 * 1.8412 = 5.5236e8 m/s.

Denominator: 2 * π * 0.002 = 0.01256637 m.

So fc = 5.5236e8 / 0.01256637 = ?

Wait, 5.5236e8 / 0.01256637.

Let me compute 5.5236e8 divided by 0.01256637.

Hmm, 5.5236e8 is 552,360,000.

Divide by 0.01256637.

Well, 552,360,000 / 0.01256637 ≈ ?

Let me compute this.

0.01256637 is approximately 1.256637e-2.

So 552,360,000 / 0.01256637 = (5.5236e8) / (1.256637e-2) ) 

= (5.5236 / 1.256637) * 1e10

5.5236 / 1.256637 ≈ 4.395.

So 4.395e10 Hz, which is 43.95 GHz.

Wait, but the options don't go up that high. The highest option is E:25 GHz. Hmm. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the formula I used is incorrect. Maybe I'm confusing the cutoff frequency for coaxial cables with that of circular waveguides.

Wait, in circular waveguides, the cutoff frequency is fc = (x_mn) * c / (2πa), where x_mn is the nth root of Jm. For TE modes, the cutoff uses the roots of Jm', the derivatives.

But for coaxial cables, perhaps the approach is different. Coaxial cables support TEM and higher-order modes, but the cutoff frequency for the first higher-order mode is given by a different formula.

Wait, another source I remember says that the cutoff frequency for the first higher-order mode in a coaxial cable is given by fc = (c) / (2π * sqrt(μϵ)) ) * (1.84) / b, where b is the outer radius. Oh wait, but I don't know the outer radius.

Wait, hold on. Oh, right, the problem gives the inner radius as 2 mm, but doesn't give the outer radius. Hmm, but the problem states that it's a 50 ohm coaxial line. So perhaps I can find the outer radius from the characteristic impedance.

The characteristic impedance Z of a coaxial cable is given by Z = (138) * log(e) (b/a), where a and b are the inner and outer radii, respectively. Wait, but the exact formula is Z0 = (η / (2π)) * ln(b/a), where η is the intrinsic impedance of the medium. For air, η is approximately 377 ohms.

So Z0 = (377 / (2π)) ) * ln(b/a) = (60) * ln(b/a) ohms.

Wait, 377/(2π) is about 60, yes. So Z0 = 60 * ln(b/a).

Given that the impedance is 50 ohms, Z0=50. So 50 = 60 * ln(b/a).

So ln(b/a) = 50/60 ≈ 0.8333.

Taking exponentials: b/a = e^(0.8333) ≈ e^0.8333.

e^0.8 is about 2.2255. e^0.8333 is about 2.300.

So b ≈ a * 2.3.

Given that a is 2 mm, so b ≈ 4.6 mm.

So the outer radius is approximately 4.6 mm.

Wait, but how does this help with the cutoff frequency? Oh, right, the cutoff frequency for the first higher-order mode depends on both a and b, I think.

Wait, I think in coaxial cables, the cutoff frequency for the first higher-order mode (TE11) is given by:

fc = (c) * (1.84) / (2π * sqrt(a*b)) )

Wait, that might be the correct formula. Let me think. The cutoff frequency involves the geometric mean of a and b.

So sqrt(a*b) is the geometric mean of the radii.

So plugging in a=2 mm, b=4.6 mm.

sqrt(2 *4.6) = sqrt(9.2) ≈ 3.033 mm.

So sqrt(a*b)=3.033 mm = 0.003033 m.

So fc = (3e8 m/s * 1.84) / (2π * 0.003033 m )

Compute numerator: 3e8 * 1.84 = 5.52e8 m/s.

Denominator: 2 * π * 0.003033 ≈ 6.2832 * 0.003033 ≈ 0.01905 m.

So fc = 5.52e8 / 0.01905 ≈ ?

Let me compute that.

5.52e8 / 0.01905 = (5.52 / 0.01905) * 1e8.

5.52 / 0.01905 ≈ let's compute.

0.01905 * 290 = 5.5295, because 0.01905 * 290 = 5.5245.

Wait, 0.01905 * 289 = ?

0.01905 * 200 = 3.81.

0.01905 * 80 = 1.524.

0.01905 *9= 0.17145.

Sum: 3.81 +1.524 =5.334; 5.334 +0.17145=5.50545.

So 289 * 0.01905 ≈5.50545.

We have 5.52 as numerator, so 289 gives about 5.505, so 289 + (5.52-5.505)/0.01905 per unit.

5.52-5.50545=0.01455.

0.01455 /0.01905 ≈0.763.

So approximately 289.763.

So 289.763 * 1e8 Hz = 28.9763e9 Hz = ~29 GHz.

Wait, but the options don't have 29 GHz. The closest is E:25 GHz. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate the denominator.

Wait, 2π * sqrt(a*b) = 2 * 3.1416 * 0.003033 m.

Wait, 2*3.1416 is 6.2832.

6.2832 * 0.003033 = let's compute it.

6 * 0.003033 =0.018198.

0.2832 *0.003033 = approx 0.000858.

So total: 0.018198 +0.000858=0.019056 m.

So denominator is 0.019056 m.

Numerator:3e8 *1.84 = 5.52e8 m/s.

So fc=5.52e8 / 0.019056 = let's compute that.

5.52e8 / 0.019056 = ?

Let me compute 5.52e8 divided by 0.019056.

Well, 5.52e8 is 552,000,000.

Divide by 0.019056:

552,000,000 / 0.019056 ≈?

Let me compute it as 552e6 / 0.019056.

Hmm, 0.019056 is approximately 1.9056e-2.

So 552e6 / 1.9056e-2 = (552 / 1.9056) * 1e8.

Compute 552 / 1.9056.

1.9056 * 290 = let's see, 200 *1.9056=381.12, 90 *1.9056=171.504. Total 381.12+171.504=552.624.

Wait, so 1.9056 * 290 =552.624, which is just a bit more than 552. So 290 would give 552.624, which is very close to 552.

So 552 /1.9056 ≈ 290 - (0.624/1.9056). 0.624/1.9056 ≈0.327. So approximately 289.67.

So 289.67 *1e8 Hz=28.967 GHz, which is about 29 GHz.

Looking back at the options, the closest is E:25 GHz, but that's 4 GHz below. Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the cutoff formula for coaxial lines is different. I've been using the formula for circular waveguides, but perhaps for coaxial lines, the cutoff is based on the inner radius only?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. For a coaxial line, the cutoff frequency for the first higher-order mode (TE11) is given by:

fc = (c) * (x) / (2πa)

where x is the first root of J1', which is 1.8412.

Wait, but in that case, I don't need the outer radius. So earlier, when I calculated fc as 43.95 GHz, that's way higher than any of the options. So that can't be right.

Wait, but perhaps the formula actually depends on both a and b, the inner and outer radii. Because in a coaxial line, the fields exist in the region between the two conductors, so the cutoff would depend on both.

So the formula I found earlier, which uses sqrt(a*b), makes sense. But when I plug in the numbers, I get 29 GHz, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses (a + b)/2 instead of sqrt(a*b). Let me try that. Let me compute (a + b)/2.

a=2 mm, b=4.6 mm. So (2+4.6)/2 =3.3 mm.

So sqrt(a*b) is about 3.03 mm, whereas (a+b)/2 is 3.3 mm.

If I use (a + b)/2 instead, what would happen?

So the formula would be:

fc = (c * x) / (2π * (a + b)/2 )

Which simplifies to (c * x) / (π (a + b)) )

Plugging in x=1.8412, c=3e8, a=2 mm, b=4.6 mm.

So (3e8 *1.8412) / (π * (2 +4.6)*1e-3) )

(3e8 *1.8412) =5.5236e8.

Denominator: π *6.6e-3 =3.1416 *6.6e-3 ≈20.71e-3 =0.02071.

So 5.5236e8 / 0.02071 ≈ ?

5.5236e8 / 0.02071 = (5.5236 /0.02071 ) *1e8.

5.5236 / 0.02071 ≈266.5.

So 266.5e8 Hz =26.65 GHz.

Hmm, that's close to option E:25 GHz, but perhaps there's a miscalculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, (a + b) is 6.6 mm, which is 6.
