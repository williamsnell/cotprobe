Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about tax amortization, and I need to figure out which option cannot be amortized for tax purposes. Hmm, I remember that when a company incorporates, there are various costs involved, and some can be amortized over time while others can't. 

Let me start by recalling what amortization means in the tax context. Amortization is the process of expensing the cost of an intangible asset over its useful life. So, certain costs related to setting up a corporation or acquiring intangible assets can be amortized.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Legal fees associated with incorporation. I think these are part of the startup costs. I remember that some startup costs can be amortized, but maybe not all. Wait, the IRS allows certain initial costs to be amortized over a specific period, like 15 years. So legal fees for incorporation might qualify.

Option B: Organizational meeting costs. These are the costs related to the initial meetings to set up the corporation. I believe these are considered organizational costs and can be amortized.

Option C: Stock issuance costs. These are the costs when a company issues stock, like underwriting fees or legal fees. I think these are considered part of the company's capital structure. Wait, but when a company issues stock, the costs are usually deducted from the proceeds and recorded as an expense or part of equity, but I'm not sure if they're amortized. Or maybe they are treated as a reduction in the stock's value but not amortized over time.

Option D: Costs associated with obtaining a patent. Patents are intangible assets, so their acquisition costs should be amortized over their useful life, which is typically the life of the patent.

Option E: Temporary directors’ fees. These might be considered organizational costs as well, especially if the directors were involved in setting up the company temporarily. So these could be amortized.

Option F: Costs associated with obtaining a business license. Business licenses are usually considered intangible assets, so their costs can be amortized over time.

Option G: Incorporation costs. This is a broad category, but I think incorporation costs can be amortized over a set period.

Wait, so the question is which cannot be amortized. Let me think again. I remember that for tax purposes, certain costs are expensed immediately, while others are capitalized and amortized. 

Stock issuance costs (Option C) are typically expensed as part of the stock offering and are not considered part of the asset. They're more like transaction costs. For example, when a company issues stock, the underwriters' fees and other costs are usually subtracted from the proceeds, but they aren't amortized. Instead, they're treated as part of the cost of raising capital, and thus expensed against equity or deducted immediately. So they don't qualify for amortization over time.

So the answer would be Option C: Stock issuance costs.

The correct answer is **C: Stock issuance costs**. Stock issuance costs are typically expensed as part of the transaction and are not amortized over time for tax purposes. These costs, such as underwriting fees and legal expenses, are usually deducted from the proceeds of the stock issuance or treated as an expense against equity, rather than being capitalized and amortized.

Answer: C
