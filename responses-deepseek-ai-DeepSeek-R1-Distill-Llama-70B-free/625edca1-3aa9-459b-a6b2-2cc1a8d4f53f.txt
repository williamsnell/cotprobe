Okay, so I've got this problem about a bank loan, and I need to find the principal amount. Hmm, let me think. Alright, the question says the interest rate is 6% for 90 days, and the interest charge is $36. I remember that interest calculations can be a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

Wait, first, I should recall the formula for simple interest. I think it's I = P * R * T, where I is the interest, P is the principal, R is the rate, and T is the time. Oh right, but time needs to be in years because the rate is annual. So 90 days would be a quarter of a year, right? Because 90 is a third of 360, wait no, wait. Wait, a year is 365 days, but sometimes in banking, they use 360 days for calculations. Hmm, I'm not sure which one to use here. The question doesn't specify, so maybe I should go with the standard approach.

Wait, the problem says the interest is for 90 days. So if the rate is 6% per annum, then the time would be 90/365, but sometimes 90/360 is used. Oh wait, but sometimes in some contexts, like in some financial calculations, a year is considered 360 days, especially for things like simple interest. This might affect the result. Let me think about the options here. 

So, if I go with 90/360, that's 0.25 years, a quarter. So the time factor is 0.25. Then the formula would be I = P * R * T. So rearranged, P = I / (R*T). 

Given that I is $36, R is 6% or 0.06, and T is 0.25. So let me plug in the numbers. 36 divided by (0.06 * 0.25). Let me compute the denominator first: 0.06 * 0.25 is 0.015. So 36 / 0.015 equals... let's see, 36 divided by 0.015. Hmm, 0.015 times 2000 is 30, because 0.015*2000 = 30. So 36 is 6 more than 30, so 6/0.015 is 400. So 2000 + 400 = 2400. So P is $2400. 

Wait, but looking at the options, option J is $2400. So that would be the answer. But wait, let me double-check. Did I use the right time factor? What if I used 90/365 instead? Let me try that approach. 

So 90/365 is approximately 0.2469 years. Then, 0.06 * 0.2469 is about 0.014814. So 36 divided by 0.014814 would be roughly 36 / 0.0148. Let me compute that. 0.0148 is about 1.48% per 90 days. So 36 / 0.0148 ≈ let's see, 36 * (1/0.0148) → 36 * (approx 67.55) → about 2428. So around $2428. But none of the options exactly match that. The closest is J: $2400. So perhaps the question assumes 90 days as 0.25 years, using 360-day convention. 

In banking, especially for short-term loans like 90 days, I think they often use 360 days a year for simple interest calculations. So in that case, 90 days is exactly a quarter, so 0.25. So the calculation I did earlier gives $2400, which is option J. So I think that's the correct answer.

To determine the principal of the loan, we use the simple interest formula:

\[
I = P \cdot R \cdot T
\]

Where:
- \( I \) = interest charge = $36
- \( R \) = annual interest rate = 6\% = 0.06
- \( T \) = time in years

Since the loan is for 90 days, we need to convert this into years. In many financial calculations, a year is assumed to have 360 days. Thus:

\[
T = \frac{90}{360} = 0.25 \, \text{years}
\]

Rearranging the formula to solve for the principal (\( P \)):

\[
P = \frac{I}{R \cdot T}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
P = \frac{36}{0.06 \cdot 0.25}
\]

First, calculate the denominator:

\[
0.06 \cdot 0.25 = 0.015
\]

Then, divide:

\[
P = \frac{36}{0.015} = 2400
\]

Thus, the principal of the loan is $2,400. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

J: $2400
