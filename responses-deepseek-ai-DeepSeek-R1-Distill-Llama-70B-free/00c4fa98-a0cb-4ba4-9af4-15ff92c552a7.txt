Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, Margaret rented a truck and drove 516 miles, which took her a certain number of days and 17 hours. She used 54 gallons of gas. The rental company charges her based on days, miles, and gasoline, plus extra hours. I need to calculate the total cost.

First, I'll break down the problem into the different charges. The total cost will be the sum of the daily charge, the mileage charge, the gasoline charge, and the extra hours charge. Let me jot down the given data:

- Miles driven: 516 miles
- Time taken: days and 17 hours. Wait, the wording says "to drive 516 miles in days and 17 hours". Hmm, maybe that's days plus 17 hours? Or is it the time taken is days, and 17 hours is the extra time beyond full days? I think I need to clarify that. Because the problem says she was charged extra hours beyond the days. So I think the time is composed of some full days plus 17 hours. So the 17 hours might be the extra time beyond the full days, and thus charged at the extra rate.

But wait, the problem says she used days and 17 hours. Oh, maybe the total time is (days) and 17 hours. So the total time she kept the truck is some days plus 17 hours. But I don't know how many days she rented it for. Hmm, wait, maybe I can calculate the days. Because she drove 516 miles, and perhaps the days are calculated based on that. Or maybe the days are separate from the driving time. Wait, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the problem states she drove 516 miles in days and 17 hours. So perhaps the total time taken to drive those miles is days plus 17 hours. But that's not possible because days and hours are different units. Maybe the time she kept the truck is (a certain number of days) plus 17 hours. So for example, if she kept the truck for 2 days and 17 hours, that would be 2 days plus 17 hours. But the problem says she drove 516 miles in that time. Wait, maybe the days and 17 hours are the total time she had the truck. So she drove 516 miles during that period. But the problem is that the rental charges are based on per day, per mile, and per gallon plus extra hours. So perhaps the days are the full days she rented, and any partial day beyond that is charged as extra hours.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me read the problem again: "drove 516 miles in days and 17 hours". Maybe the total time is days plus 17 hours. So she kept the truck for (days) + 17 hours. So the days are the number of full days she rented. And the 17 hours are extra beyond those days. So the 17 hours would be charged at the extra rate.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify how many days she rented. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think differently. The total time she used the truck is "days and 17 hours". So perhaps it's (number of days) plus 17 hours. But without knowing the number of days, I can't compute the extra hours. Wait, no, wait. Let me reread the question.

Wait, the question says she drove 516 miles in days and 17 hours. So the time taken to drive 516 miles is days and 17 hours. So, perhaps she spent a certain number of days driving, and 17 hours. But that doesn't make sense because driving 516 miles could take days and hours, but the way it's phrased might mean that the total time is days plus 17 hours. Alternatively, perhaps the "days and 17 hours" refers to the rental period, not the driving time. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, maybe the way it's phrased is that she drove 516 miles over a period of days and 17 hours. So, she had the truck for that duration, and during that time she drove 516 miles. So her total rental time is days plus 17 hours, and she drove 516 miles in that time. But without knowing the number of days, how can I compute the charges? Because the daily charge is per day. Wait, perhaps the days are the number of days she rented, and 17 hours is the extra time beyond that. So for example, if she rented for 2 days and 17 hours, the cost would be 2 days at $32 each, plus 17 hours at $2.75 each. But wait, the problem says "days and 17 hours"â€”so maybe the days are 1 day and 17 hours? Or perhaps she drove for 516 miles in 1 day and 17 hours? I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps "days and 17 hours" refers to the total time she had the truck. So, for example, if she kept it for 2 days and 17 hours, that's 2 full days plus 17 hours. But without knowing the number of days, how can I proceed? Wait, maybe I can find the number of days by considering the driving time. Because she drove 516 miles. But unless I know her driving speed, I can't determine how many days she spent driving. So perhaps that approach isn't correct.

Wait, maybe the "days and 17 hours" is the total time she kept the truck, and she drove 516 miles during that time. So the time she spent driving is 516 miles. Wait, but 516 miles is distance, not time. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the charges.

The rental company charges:

- $32 per day: So each full day she rents, it's $32.
- $0.22 per mile: So for each mile she drives, it's 22 cents.
- $0.445 per gallon of gas: So each gallon used is 44.5 cents.
- Extra hours beyond the days are charged at $2.75 per hour.

So the total cost will be:

Total = (Number of days * $32) + (516 miles * $0.22) + (54 gallons * $0.445) + (Extra hours * $2.75)

But I need to figure out how many days and how many extra hours she was charged for. So the problem states she drove 516 miles in "days and 17 hours". So perhaps the total time she had the truck is (number of days) plus 17 hours. So she was charged for the days at $32 each, and for the 17 hours at $2.75 each.

Wait, that makes sense. So the 17 hours are extra beyond the days. So the days are full days, and any time beyond that is charged as extra hours. So the 17 hours are extra, so she's charged for those.

So the daily charge would be based on the number of full days she rented. But the problem is that I don't know how many days she rented. Because the problem says she drove 516 miles in days and 17 hours. So perhaps the driving time is days and 17 hours, but I can't determine the days from that.

Wait, unless the days are 0, meaning she drove 516 miles in 17 hours. But that would mean she had the truck for 17 hours, which is less than a day. But the problem says "days and 17 hours", which implies that the time includes some full days plus 17 hours. So perhaps she kept the truck for a certain number of days plus 17 hours. So for example, if she kept it for 1 day and 17 hours, that would be 1 day plus 17 hours. But then, how many days is that? 1 day plus 17 hours is 1. It depends on how the company counts the days. If they charge per full day, then any part of a day beyond the full days is considered extra hours.

Wait, maybe she used the truck for a certain number of full days, and then an additional 17 hours beyond those days. So the 17 hours are extra beyond the full days. So the daily charge is per each full day, and the 17 hours are extra. So the total time she had the truck is (number of days) + 17 hours.

But the problem is that without knowing the number of days, I can't compute the daily charge. Wait, but maybe the 516 miles and 17 hours are the driving time, and the rental period is days and 17 hours. So perhaps she drove for 516 miles, which took her (days) and 17 hours. But again, without knowing her speed, I can't find the days.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me consider that she was charged for the number of days she kept the truck, plus any extra hours beyond full days. So the "days and 17 hours" is the total rental period. So, for example, if she kept it for 2 days and 17 hours, the days are 2, and the extra hours are 17. But then, how does she drive 516 miles in that time? I'm not sure. Maybe the driving time is separate from the rental period. Alternatively, perhaps the 516 miles is the distance, and the time is the rental duration, which is days plus 17 hours. But without knowing the driving time per day, I can't relate them.

Wait, perhaps the "days and 17 hours" refers to the total duration she kept the truck. So she kept the truck for (x days) and 17 hours. So the 17 hours are the extra beyond the full days. So she is charged x days at $32 per day, and 17 hours at $2.75 per hour. But how do I find x, the number of days? Because the problem doesn't provide information about her driving time beyond the miles driven. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to read the problem again more carefully.

Margaret Denault recently rented a truck to drive 516 miles in days and 17 hours, using 54 gallons of gasoline. The rental company charged her $32 per day, $.22 per mile, and $.445 per gallon of gas. Extra hours were charged $2.75 per hour. Find the total cost of the rental.

Wait, the way it's phrased is she drove 516 miles in "days and 17 hours". So perhaps "days" refers to the number of days she drove, and 17 hours is the total driving time beyond those days. Or wait, maybe she drove for several days and 17 hours, but the total driving time is days and 17 hours. But again, without knowing the number of days, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps "days" in this context refers to 1 day. So she drove 516 miles in 1 day and 17 hours. So that would be 1 day plus 17 hours, which is 25 hours total. But that doesn't make sense because 1 day is 24 hours, so 1 day and 17 hours is 41 hours. Wait, that's more than a day and a half. But I'm not sure if that's relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps "days and 17 hours" is the total time she kept the truck, which includes driving and possibly other times. So she drove 516 miles during that period, which took her some of the days and hours. But without knowing how much time she actually spent driving versus just having the truck, I can't determine the days.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the "days and 17 hours" is the total time she had the truck, regardless of driving. So she kept the truck for x days and 17 hours, during which she drove 516 miles. So the days and hours are the rental period, and the miles are the distance driven during that time. So the charges are based on the rental period and the miles driven and gas used.

So the days she's charged for are x days, and any hours beyond that are extra. Wait, but if the total rental time is x days and 17 hours, then perhaps x is the number of full days, and 17 hours are extra. So she's charged x days at $32/day plus 17 hours at $2.75/hour.

But how do I find x? Because the problem gives me the miles driven and the gas used, but no direct relation to time. Unless I can calculate the time spent driving based on miles and gas.

Wait, perhaps I can find out how many hours she spent driving by using the gas consumption. If she used 54 gallons, and perhaps assuming a certain miles per gallon (mpg) rating, but the problem doesn't provide that information. So that approach won't work.

Alternatively, perhaps the "days and 17 hours" is the time she spent driving, not the total rental period. So she drove for x days and 17 hours, which is the time taken to drive 516 miles. But again, without knowing her speed, I can't find x. So this seems like a dead end.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted that she rented the truck for a certain number of days, and also had 17 extra hours beyond those days. So the total time is days + 17 hours. But the miles driven (516) and gas used (54 gallons) don't affect the time calculation. So perhaps the days are not related to the driving time but are simply the number of days she kept the truck. So she was charged for some days, plus 17 extra hours, plus the miles driven and gas used.

But without knowing the number of days, I can't compute the daily charge. Hmm. Wait, maybe the days are 1 day. Because 17 hours is less than a day (24 hours), so perhaps she kept the truck for 1 day and 17 hours. So the days would be 1, and the extra hours would be 17.

Wait, if she kept the truck for 1 day and 17 hours, that would be 1 full day plus 17 hours. So the daily charge would be 1 * $32 = $32. The extra hours charge would be 17 * $2.75 = let's calculate that. 17 * 2.75: 17 * 2 = 34, 17 * 0.75 = 12.75, so total 46.75. So extra hours cost $46.75.

Wait, but if the 17 hours are part of the same day, then perhaps she's charged for 1 day plus 17 hours. But some rental companies charge per day, and any fraction of a day beyond that as extra hours. So if she kept the truck for, say, 25 hours, that's 1 day (24 hours) plus 1 hour extra. But in her case, it's 1 day plus 17 hours, which is 41 hours. So 1 day plus 17 hours. So she's charged for 1 day and 17 extra hours.

So if I proceed with that assumption, then the daily charge is $32, and the extra hours are 17 * $2.75 = $46.75.

Now, let's compute the other charges.

Miles driven: 516 miles, at $0.22 per mile. So 516 * 0.22 = let's compute that. 500 * 0.22 = 110, 16 * 0.22 = 3.52, so total 113.52.

Gasoline: 54 gallons at $0.445 per gallon. 54 * 0.445. Let's compute that. 50 * 0.445 = 22.25, 4 * 0.445 = 1.78, so total 22.25 + 1.78 = 24.03.

Now, adding up all the charges:

Daily: $32.00
Extra hours: $46.75
Miles: $113.52
Gas: $24.03

Total = 32 + 46.75 = 78.75. Then 78.75 + 113.52 = 192.27. Then +24.03 gives 216.3.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see $216.30. Let me check the options again:

Options are A to J, with amounts like $308.25, $142.75, etc.

Wait, perhaps my assumption about the days is incorrect. Maybe the days are more than 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the total time she kept the truck is 2 days and 17 hours. Let me try that approach.

If she kept it for 2 days and 17 hours:

Daily charge: 2 * $32 = $64.

Extra hours:17 * $2.75 = $46.75.

Miles:516 * 0.22 = $113.52.

Gas:54 * 0.445 = $24.03.

Total cost: 64 + 46.75 = 110.75; +113.52 = 224.27; +24.03 = 248.3. That's around $248.30, which isn't among the options either.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps "days and 17 hours" refers to the time she spent driving, not the rental period. So she drove 516 miles in a time of (x days) and 17 hours. But without knowing her speed, I can't find x.

Alternatively, perhaps the "days" in the problem refers to the number of days she rented the truck, and 17 hours are the extra. So she rented for x days, plus 17 hours extra. So the daily charge is x * $32, and the extra hours are 17 * $2.75.

But again, without knowing x, I can't compute this. Wait, maybe the 516 miles and 54 gallons can help find x. Let's think: if she drove 516 miles using 54 gallons, her mileage is 516 miles / 54 gallons = 9.555... miles per gallon. That's roughly 9.56 mpg.

If she drove 516 miles at 9.56 mpg, how long did she drive? Well, time is distance divided by speed. But without her speed, I can't find the time. So this approach isn't helping.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to treat "days and 17 hours" as 1 day and 17 hours, making the total rental period 1 day plus 17 hours. So x=1 day. So let's proceed with that.

So daily charge:1 * 32 = $32.

Extra hours:17 * 2.75 = $46.75.

Miles:516 * 0.22 = $113.52.

Gas:54 * 0.445 = $24.03.

Total = 32 + 46.75 = 78.75; 78.75 +113.52=192.27; 192.27 +24.03=216.30.

Looking at the options, the closest is option I
