Okay, so I've got this problem about a rotating coil and induced emf. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem states that there's a coil with five series-connected turns rotating at 1200 rpm. The flux per pole is phi = 3e6 maxwells, and the number of poles is p = 6. I need to find the average induced emf, the amplitude, and the effective value. The options are given as A through J.

Wait, I remember that induced emf in a rotating coil is related to the rate of change of magnetic flux. Faraday's Law, right? So the average emf would be the product of the number of turns, the flux, and the rotational speed in terms of revolutions per second, but I might be mixing some details here.

Let me get the formulas straight. The average induced emf (E_avg) for a coil rotating in a magnetic field is given by E_avg = N * phi * (P/120), where P is the number of poles. Wait, no, maybe that's not exactly right. Oh wait, no, the formula I recall is E_avg = (N * phi * omega) / (2π), but I'm not sure. Hmm.

Wait, more accurately, the average emf in a coil with N turns rotating at a speed of n revolutions per minute in a magnetic field with p poles is given by E_avg = (N * phi * n * p) / (60 * 2). Or maybe I'm getting confused between average and maximum values.

Wait, no, the maximum emf (E_m) for sinusoidal flux is given by E_m = N * dΦ/dt, where dΦ/dt is the rate of change of flux. Since Φ = phi * sin(theta), dΦ/dt = phi * omega * cos(theta). The maximum happens when cos(theta) is 1, so E_m = N * phi * omega.

Wait, but omega is the angular velocity in radians per second. So I need to convert the RPM to radians per second.

Wait, the coil makes 1200 revolutions per minute. One revolution is 2π radians, so omega in rad/s would be (1200 rev/min) * (2π rad/rev) * (1 min/60 seconds) ) = 1200 * 2 * π / 60 = (40 * π) rad/s. So omega = 40π rad/s.

But wait, the number of poles is 6. How does that affect things? Oh right, because the number of poles affects how many times the coil cuts the flux lines per revolution. For a 6-pole machine, each revolution causes 6 flux reversals, I think. Or wait, each pole pair changes the direction of the flux. So for p poles, the frequency f is (n * p)/60, where n is the rpm. Because normally, for a 2-pole machine, each revolution gives one cycle (since north and south poles alternate once per rev). So for 6 poles, each revolution would cause 3 cycles (since 6/2=3). So the frequency would be (1200 rpm * 6 poles) / 60 = 120 rpm. Wait, but rpm is revolutions per minute, so 1200 *6 /60 = 120 cycles per minute, which is 2 Hz. So f = 2 Hz.

Wait, but the formula for induced emf when the flux is sinusoidal is E(t) = E_m sin(ωt + φ), where E_m is the maximum emf. The rms (effective) value would be E_m / sqrt(2), and the average would be zero over a full cycle, but maybe in some contexts, like half-wave rectified, it's different. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says "the average emf induced in the coil" and then asks for the amplitude and effective value when the flux is sinusoidally distributed.

Hmm. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's make this systematic.

First, let's find the average emf. Wait, but if the flux is changing sinusoidally, the induced emf would also be sinusoidal. The average of a sine wave over a full cycle is zero, but perhaps the question is considering the average magnitude or something else. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It says, "What is the average emf induced in the coil?" and then it also asks for amplitude and effective value when the flux is sinusoidal.

Wait, perhaps the first part is about the average emf when the flux is constant? Or perhaps it's a misunderstanding in the question. Alternatively, maybe it's a different scenario. Wait, the first part is just the average emf, and the next parts are when the flux is sinusoidal.

Wait, perhaps I should first compute the average emf for a rotating coil. But in the case where the coil is rotating in a uniform flux, the induced emf is unidirectional and has an average value. Wait, for a rotating coil in a DC magnetic field, the emf induced is sinusoidal, but that's when the flux is sinusoidally distributed. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should re-read the problem. Oh, the flux per pole is phi = 3e6 maxwells, and number of poles is p=6. So perhaps the average emf is calculated under a certain condition, and the amplitude and rms under another (sinusoidal flux).

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me start by calculating the maximum emf for sinusoidal flux.

So for sinusoidal flux, the maximum induced emf E_m is given by E_m = N * (dΦ/dt)max.

But dΦ/dt is equal to phi_max * ω. Since phi varies as phi = phi_m sin(ωt), then dΦ/dt = phi_m * ω cos(ωt), so the maximum is phi_m * ω.

Thus, E_m = N * phi_m * ω.

Wait, but I need to account for the number of poles. Because the angular velocity is related to the number of poles. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps ω is the angular speed in radians per second, which as I calculated earlier is 40π rad/s.

So N is the number of turns, which is 5.

Phi is given as 3e6 maxwells. Wait, but wait, the flux per pole is 3e6 maxwells. So the total flux through the coil would be the flux per pole times the number of poles, but wait, no, that's not correct. Because for each pole, the flux is phi, but when the coil rotates, each turn links with each pole's flux.

Wait, perhaps the formula accounts for the number of poles in the expression of the frequency.

Wait, going back. The formula for the rms emf induced in a rotating coil is E_rms = (N * phi * f * ω) / something. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck.

Alternatively, the general formula for the rms emf in a rotating coil is E_rms = N * phi * (P/2) * (n/(60)).

Wait, P is the number of poles. So let me think again.

The frequency f is (number of poles * rpm) / 120. Because for each revolution, a 2-pole machine produces one cycle (since it goes from N to S once per revolution). So for p poles, the number of cycles per revolution is p/2. So f = (n * p) / 120.

So f = (1200 * 6) / 120 = 60 Hz. Wait, that's a high frequency, but maybe that's correct.

Wait, wait: n is 1200 rpm. So each minute, it makes 1200 revolutions. Each revolution, for p=6 poles, how many cycles? Since each pair of poles (N and S) makes one cycle per revolution, so 6 poles would make 3 cycles per revolution. So f = (1200 rev/min) * (3 cycles/rev) ) / 60 s/min = 1200*3 /60 = 60 Hz.

So f = 60 Hz. Then ω = 2πf = 120π rad/s.

Wait, earlier I thought ω was 40π based on 1200 rpm. But that's if I didn't account for the number of poles.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Because when the coil makes 1200 rpm, it's 20 revolutions per second (1200/60). But each revolution causes the coil to be cut by the flux p times, but perhaps that's not correct. Wait, for a 6-pole machine, the rotational speed in terms of the magnetic field is higher. So the frequency would be (n * p)/120 = (1200 *6)/120 = 60 Hz. Therefore, ω = 2πf = 120π rad/s.

So E_m (the amplitude) would be N * phi * ω / (2π) ? Wait, no, let me get this right.

Wait, the formula for maximum emf is E_m = N * (dΦ/dt)_max.

Since Φ(t) = phi * sin(ωt), dΦ/dt = phi * ω cos(ωt), so maximum dΦ/dt is phi * ω.

Thus, E_m = N * phi * ω.

Wait, but wait, maybe it's (N * phi * ω) divided by something. Because sometimes the formula includes the number of poles in a different way.

Wait, another approach: The average emf when the flux is sinusoidal would be zero, but the rms value is E_m / sqrt(2). However, the question seems to ask for the average emf in the coil in the first part, perhaps when the flux is not sinusoidal, or maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, the question is: What is the average emf induced in the coil? What is the amplitude and the effective value of the emf induced in the coil if the flux is sinusoidally distributed?

Ah, so the first part asks for the average emf, perhaps under DC conditions, and the second part when it's sinusoidal. Or maybe it's about when the coil is rotating, but the flux is DC, so the induced emf is AC, sinusoidal, but then the average over a cycle would be zero. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, perhaps the first part is asking about the average absolute value of the emf, or perhaps the average magnitude. Alternatively, maybe it's a mistake, and the first part refers to the maximum emf when the flux is changing.

Wait, let me think again. The first part is asking for the average emf. If the flux is changing sinusoidally, the average emf over a full cycle would be zero. But that can't be right because none of the options have zero for the average. So perhaps the first part is referring to a different scenario, like when the coil is rotating in a uniform magnetic field, and the flux is constant, but the coil is rotating, leading to an induced emf.

Wait, no, when the coil rotates in a uniform magnetic field, the flux through it changes sinusoidally, leading to a sinusoidal emf. So the average emf over a full cycle would be zero. So perhaps the question is phrased differently. Alternatively, maybe the first part is considering the average magnitude of the induced emf.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me focus on the given data.

Given:

- N = 5 turns
- Speed, n = 1200 rpm
- Phi per pole, phi = 3e6 maxwells
- Number of poles, p = 6

So, perhaps the average emf is calculated using the formula E_avg = (N * phi * n * p) / (60 * 2). Wait, let me check the formula.

Wait, I think the correct formula for average induced emf (E_avg) when the coil is rotating in a magnetic field is E_avg = (N * phi * n * p) / (60 * 2), where n is in rpm and p is the number of poles. But I'm not entirely sure about this formula.

Alternatively, the formula for the average emf in a rotating coil is E_avg = (N * phi * (n * p)) / 120. Because for each revolution, each pole contributes to the flux change. Wait, that sounds plausible.

So substituting the values: E_avg = (5 * 3e6 * 1200 *6) / 120.

Wait, let me compute that.

5 * 3e6 = 15e6.

15e6 * 1200 = 1.8e10.

1.8e10 *6 = 1.08e11.

Divide by 120: 1.08e11 / 120 = 9e8 volts? That can't be right because the options are around 30-40 volts. Clearly, I'm making a mistake in the formula.

Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of frequency. Since f = (n * p)/120 = (1200 *6)/120 = 60 Hz.

Then, the maximum emf E_m would be E_m = N * phi * omega, where omega is 2πf.

So omega = 2π*60 = 120π rad/s.

Thus, E_m = 5 * 3e6 * 120π.

Wait, that would be 5 *3e6 = 1.5e7, multiplied by 120π gives 1.5e7 * 120 * π ≈ 1.5e7 * 376.99 ≈ 5.65e9 volts. That's way too high. So that can't be right.

Wait, I must have a mistake in units. Let me check the units.

Phi is given in maxwells. 1 maxwell is 1 weber, which is 1 volt-second. So the units are correct.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the formula. Perhaps the correct formula is E_m = N * phi * (p/2) * (n/60). Because the number of poles affects the frequency as f = (pn)/(120). So E_m = N * phi * (2πf).

Wait, let me compute f first. f = (p * n) / 120 = (6 * 1200) / 120 = 60 Hz.

Then omega = 2πf = 120π rad/s.

So E_m = N * phi * omega. So N=5, phi=3e6 Wb, omega=120π.

So E_m =5 *3e6 *120π.

Wait, 5 *3e6 = 1.5e7.

1.5e7 *120 = 1.8e9.

1.8e9 * π ≈ 5.65e9 volts. That's way too high, which is impossible because the options are much lower.

So I must be doing something wrong. Maybe the formula is different. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the maximum emf is E_m = (N * phi * n * p)/(60 * 2π). Wait, but let me check the units.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use E_avg = (N * phi * n * p)/(60 * 2). Because for each pole, each revolution contributes a certain amount.

Wait, let's think about the average emf when the coil is rotating. The formula I've seen before is E_avg = (N * phi * f * p) / something.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is E_avg = (N * phi * n * p) / (60 * 2). Let me plug in the numbers.

N=5, phi=3e6, n=1200, p=6.

So E_avg = (5 *3e6 *1200 *6) / (60 * 2).

Compute numerator: 5 *3e6 = 1.5e7, 1.5e7 *1200 = 1.8e10, 1.8e10 *6 = 1.08e11.

Denominator: 60 *2 = 120.

So 1.08e11 / 120 = 9e8 volts. Again, way too high.

Hmm, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Let me try a different approach.

The induced emf in a rotating coil is given by E = N * (dΦ/dt), and for sinusoidal flux, dΦ/dt = ωΦ sin(ωt + π/2), so the maximum emf is E_m = N * ω * Φ.

Wait, but ω in terms of the coil's rotation. So ω = 2πn/(60) rad/s, where n is rpm.

Wait, n is 1200 rpm, so ω = 2π *1200 /60 = 40π rad/s.

But that's without considering the number of poles. Oh wait, perhaps the number of poles affects the frequency, not the angular velocity.

So when the coil makes one full rotation (2π rad), the number of pole pairs determines how many times the flux through the coil reverses. For p poles, there are p/2 pole pairs, so the frequency would be f = (n * p/2)/60 = (n p)/(120).

So f = (1200 *6)/120 = 60 Hz. So ω = 2πf = 120π rad/s.

So now, E_m = N * phi * ω.

So N=5, phi=3e6, ω=120π.

E_m =5 *3e6 *120π = 5 *3e6 *376.99... ≈ 5*3e6*377 ≈ 5.65e9 V. Again, that's way too high.

This can't be right because the options are in the range of 30-60 volts.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula for E_m. Maybe it's E_m = (N * phi * ω) / (2π). Let me try that.

E_m = (5 *3e6 *120π) / (2π) = (5*3e6 *120) /2 = (5*3e6 *60) = 5*3e6*60 = 5*1.8e8 = 9e8 V. Still way too high.

Wait, I'm clearly doing something wrong here. Maybe the flux per pole is given as phi, but in a p-pole machine, the total flux through the coil is phi multiplied by the number of poles that the coil is linking with. Hmm, but that depends on the winding configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is E_m = (N * phi * n * p)/(60 * 2π). Let me try that.

So E_m = (5 *3e6 *1200 *6) / (60 * 2π).

Compute numerator: 5*3e6 = 1.5e7, times 1200 = 1.8e10, times 6 = 1
