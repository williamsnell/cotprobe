Okay, so I've got this transformer problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's see if I can work through it. The question has three parts, (a), (b), and (c). I'll tackle them one by one, but I'll start by trying to understand what each part is asking for.

Starting with part (a): Calculate the mutual flux φ_m. Hmm, mutual flux. I remember that mutual flux is the flux that links both the primary and secondary windings of a transformer. It's related to the induced voltage in the primary winding.

The given values are a primary voltage of 2,300 volts, a frequency of 60 cycles, and 4,800 turns on the primary. I think the formula for induced voltage in a transformer is E = 4.44 f N Φ_m, where f is frequency, N is the number of turns, and Φ_m is the mutual flux. Oh wait, that's right because the induced EMF is given by the maximum value of E = 4.44 * f * N * Φ_m, where Φ_m is the mutual flux.

So for part (a), the primary induced voltage E_p is 2,300 volts. Plugging into the formula:

E_p = 4.44 * f * N_p * Φ_m

We can solve for Φ_m:

Φ_m = E_p / (4.44 * f * N_p)

Wait, let me make sure I'm using the right values. E_p is 2300 V, f is 60 Hz, N_p is 4800 turns.

So Φ_m = 2300 / (4.44 * 60 * 4800)

Let me compute the denominator first. 4.44 * 60 = 266.4. Then 266.4 * 4800 = let's see, 266.4 * 4800. Hmm, 266.4 * 4800. Let me calculate that.

Wait, maybe breaking it down: 266.4 * 4800 = 266.4 * 48 * 100.

266.4 * 48: let's calculate 266 * 48. 200*48=9600, 60*48=2880, 6*48=288. So 9600+2880=12480 + 288=12768. Then 0.4 *48 =19.2. So total is 12768 +19.2 = 12787.2. Multiply by 100 gives 1,278,720.

So Φ_m = 2300 / 1,278,720. Let's compute that.

2300 divided by approximately 1.2787e6. Let me do 2300 ÷ 1,278,720. Let's see, 1.2787e6 is about 1,278,720.

2300 / 1,278,720 ≈ 0.0018. But wait, let me compute this more accurately.

Wait, 2300 ÷ 1,278,720 can be written as 2300 / (1.27872e6) = approx 0.001799, which is about 1.799e-3 webers. Wait, but wait a second, 1.8e5 seems high. Wait, no, wait: wait, 1.8e5 is 180,000. But 1.8e-3 is 0.0018. Wait, I'm getting confused here.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute it again. 2300 divided by 1,278,720.

Let me compute 2300 ÷ 1,278,720.

Let me do this division step by step.

1,278,720 = 1.27872e6

2300 / 1.27872e6 = approximately 2300 / 1,278,720.

Let me compute it as 2300 ÷ 1,278,720.

Using a calculator approach:

Well, 1,278,720 divided by 2300 is about 555. So 1/555 is approximately 0.0018. So 2300/(1.278e6) is approximately 0.0018, which is 1.8e-3 webers. Wait that's 0.0018 Wb. But looking at the options, the answers are in 1e5 range. So I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, maybe I mixed up the formula. Let me double-check. The formula for induced voltage is correct: E = 4.44 * f * N * Φ_m. So solving for Φ_m gives Φ_m = E/(4.44*f*N). So I think I did that right.

Wait, let me recalculate the denominator. 4.44 * 60 = 266.4. 266.4 * 4800.

Wait, 266.4 * 4800. Let me see: 4800 is 48 * 100. So 266.4 * 48 = ?

266.4 * 48: let's compute 200*48=9600, 60*48=2880 (wait, no, 60 is 60? Wait, 266.4 is 200 + 66.4. So 200*48=9600, 66.4 *48. 60*48=2880, 6.4*48=307.2. So 2880+307.2=3187.2. So 200*48=9600, 66.4*48=3187.2, total 9600 + 3187.2=12787.2. Then multiply by 100 (because 4800=48*100), so 12787.2 *100=1,278,720. So denominator is 1.27872e6.

So Φ_m = 2300 / 1,278,720. So 2300 ÷ 1,278,720.

Let me compute this as 2300 ÷ 1.27872e6.

2300 ÷ 1.27872e6 = approximately 2300 / 1,278,720 ≈ 0.001799 ≈ 1.799e-3 Wb.

Wait, that's 0.001799 Wb, which is 1.799e-3 Wb. But looking at the options, the answers are way higher, like 1.7e5, which is 170,000 times higher. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Maybe I confused the formula for mutual flux with something else. Alternatively, perhaps I used the wrong voltage. Oh wait! Wait a second, the primary voltage is 2300 volts. But in some contexts, when it's a step-down or step-up transformer, the primary voltage is the one applied, but mutual flux is same in both. However, the formula I used should be correct.

Wait, maybe I mixed up the formula for flux as Φ = E/(4.44 f N). So that's correct. So plugging in 2300/(4.44 *60 *4800) gives me 2300/(1,278,720) ≈ 0.0018 Wb. Wait, but that's 1.8e-3 Wb, which is 1.8 milliwebers.

But looking at the answer options, all the (a) parts are in the order of 1e5 maxwells. 1e5 maxwells is 0.1 webers. Wait, 1 maxwell is 1e-8 Wb, right? Wait, no, wait: 1 maxwell (Mx) is 1e-8 webers. So 1e6 maxwells is 1e-2 Wb. So 3.76e6 maxwells is 0.0376 Wb.

Wait, but in part (c), the maximum flux is given as 3.76e6 maxwells, which is 0.0376 Wb. So why is part (a) giving options in the 1e5 maxwells (i.e., 0.0001 Wb) range? Because 1e5 maxwells is 1e5 *1e-8 Wb = 1e-3 Wb, which is 0.001 Wb, which is 1 mWb. So my calculation of 0.0018 Wb (1.8 mWb) is about 1.8e3 maxwells. But the options for part (a) are 1.5e5, 1.6e5, etc. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Hold on, perhaps I used the wrong number of turns. Wait, the primary has 4,800 turns. So N_p is 4800. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, let me recompute that division. 2300 divided by 1,278,720.

Let me compute 2300 / 1,278,720.

Let me write it as 2300 ÷ 1,278,720 ≈ 2300 / 1.27872e6.

Approximating, 1.27872e6 is about 1.28e6. 2300 / 1.28e6.

2300 ÷ 1.28e6 = (2300 ÷ 1.28) ÷ 1e6.

2300 ÷ 1.28: let's compute that.

1.28 × 1795 ≈ 2300?

Wait, 1.28 * 1795 = ?

Wait, 1.28 * 1800 = 2304. So 1.28 * 1795 is approximately 2300.

So 2300 ÷ 1.28 ≈ 1795.

So 2300 ÷ 1.27872e6 ≈ 1795 / 1e6 ≈ 0.001795 Wb, which is 1.795e-3 Wb, or 1795 microWebers, which is 1.795e-3 Wb. But wait, 1e-3 Wb is 1 mWb, which is 1e5 maxwells because 1 Wb = 1e8 maxwells. So 1e-3 Wb = 1e5 maxwells.

Wait, wait: 1 Wb = 1e8 maxwells. So 1e-3 Wb is 1e5 maxwells. So 1.795e-3 Wb is 179,500 maxwells, which is 1.795e5 maxwells. So approximately 1.8e5 maxwells.

Looking at the options, option H is (a) 1.8e5 maxwells. So that would be the answer for part (a). But wait, I need to check the other options.

Looking at the options:

Option H: a) 1.8e5 maxwells.

So that matches what I calculated for part (a). So part (a)'s answer is H, but wait, wait: the options list each choice as (a), (b), (c) for each letter, so I have to check all parts.

Moving on to part (b): the number of turns in the 230-volt secondary winding.

The primary voltage is 2300 V, and the secondary is 230 V. So the turns ratio is V_p / V_s = N_p / N_s. So N_s = (V_s * N_p) / V_p.

So N_s = (230 V * 4800 turns) / 2300 V. Let's compute that.

230 *4800 = 230 *48 *100 = (230*48)=11040, so 11040 *100=1,104,000.

Divide by 2300: 1,104,000 /2300.

Let me compute that.

1,104,000 ÷ 2300 = 1,104,000 ÷ 2.3e3 = (1,104,000 / 2.3) / 1e3.

1,104,000 ÷ 2.3 = let's see: 2.3 * 480,000 = 1,104,000. So 480,000. So 480,000 /1e3 is 480.

So N_s is 480 turns.

Looking at the options:

Option H: (b) 480 turns. So that matches.

So for parts (a) and (b), option H is looking good so far.

Now part (c): the maximum flux in the core of a 60-cycle transformer that has 1320 primary turns and 46 secondary turns is 3.76 × 10^6 maxwells. Also, calculate the primary and secondary induced voltages.

Wait, wait, the question is a bit confusing. Is part (c) a separate problem? Let me read it again.

(c) The maximum flux in the core of a 60-cycle transformer that has 1320 primary turns and 46 secondary turns is 3.76 × 10^6 maxwells. Also, calculate the primary and secondary induced voltages.

Wait, so in this part, the transformer has N_p =1320, N_s=46, f=60 Hz, and Φ_m=3.76e6 maxwells. So they're asking for the induced voltages E_p and E_s.

Wait, but wait, the mutual flux Φ_m is given as 3.76e6 maxwells. So Φ_m is 3.76e6 maxwells, which is 3.76e6 * 1e-8 Wb = 0.0376 Wb.

So to find the induced voltages, use E = 4.44 f N Φ_m.

Compute E_p and E_s.

First, for the primary:

E_p = 4.44 * f * N_p * Φ_m.

Given f=60 Hz, N_p=1320, Φ_m=3.76e6 maxwells = 0.0376 Wb.

So E_p =4.44 *60 *1320 *0.0376.

Let me compute this step by step.

Compute 4.44 *60 first: 4.44 *60=266.4.

Then multiply by 1320: 266.4 *1320.

Hmm, let's compute 266.4 *1320.

266.4 * 1000=266400.

266.4 * 300=79,920.

266.4 * 20=5,328.

Adding them up: 266,400 +79,920=346,320 +5,328=351,648.

So 4.44*60*1320=351,648.

Then multiply by Φ_m=0.0376.

351,648 * 0.0376.

Let me compute that. 351,648 * 0.0376.

Breaking it down: 351,648 * 0.03 = 10,549.44.

351,648 * 0.007 = 2,461.536.

351,648 * 0.0006 = 210.9888.

Adding them together: 10,549.44 +2,461.536=13,010.976 +210.9888=13,221.9648 volts.

So E_p ≈13,222 volts.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, 351,648 * 0.0376.

Alternatively, compute 351,648 * 376e-4.

But perhaps a better way is to compute 351,648 * 0.0376:

= 351,648 * (0.03 + 0.007 + 0.0006)
= 351,648 * 0.03 = 10,549.44
+ 351,648 * 0.007 = 2,461.536
+351,648 *0.0006=210.9888
Total: 10,549.44 + 2,461.536 = 13,010.976 + 210.9888 = 13,221.9648 V.

So E_p ≈13,222 V.

Now for E_s, the secondary induced voltage.

E_s = 4.44 * f * N_s * Φ_m.

N_s is 46, so:

E_s =4.44 *60 *46 *0.0376.

Compute step by step.

4.44 *60 =266.4.

266.4 *46: let's compute 200*46=9200, 60*46=2760, 6.4*46=294.4. So 9200+2760=11,960 +294.4=12,254.4.

Then multiply by 0.0376:

12,254.4 * 0.0376.

Compute 12,254.4 *0.03=367.632.

12,254.4 *0.007=85.7808.

12,254.4 *0.0006=7.35264.

Add them: 367.632 +85.7808=453.4128 +7.35264=460.76544 V.

So E_s≈460.77 volts.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H for part (c) is 13,200 volts and 460 volts. Which matches our calculation: E_p≈13,222 V, which is about 13,200 V, and E_s≈460.77 V, which is 460 V.

So part (c): E_p=13,200 V, E_s=460 V.

Looking at the options, option H's part (c) says primary and secondary induced voltages are 13,200 V and 460 V, which matches.

So all three parts point to option H being correct.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze each part systematically:

---

### Part (a): Mutual Flux (Φₘ)
The formula for mutual flux is:

\[
\Phi_m = \frac{E_p}{4.44 \cdot f \cdot N_p}
\]

Given:
- \(E_p = 2300 \, \text{V}\),
- \(f = 60 \, \text{Hz}\),
- \(N_p = 4800 \, \text{turns}\),

we calculate:

\[
\Phi_m = \frac{2300}{4.44 \cdot 60 \cdot 4800} = \frac{2300}{1,278,720} \approx 0.0018 \, \text{Wb} = 1.8 \times 10^5 \, \text{maxwells}.
\]

Thus, the mutual flux is \(1.8 \times 10^5 \, \text{maxwells}\).

---

### Part (b): Number of Turns in the Secondary Winding
The turns ratio of a
