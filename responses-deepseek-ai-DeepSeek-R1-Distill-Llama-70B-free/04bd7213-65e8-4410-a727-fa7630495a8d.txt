Question:

 In response to the argument that embryos are not persons because they do not exercise higher mental capacities, Lee and George argue that

Options:

A: it doesn't make sense to say that a person exercises higher mental capacities.
B: mental capacities should not be a factor in determining personhood.
C: the ability to exercise higher mental capacities could be considered a potential, not an actuality.
D: to have killed a human embryos that developed into you would have been the same thing as killing you.
E: embryos actually do exercise higher mental capacities.
F: higher mental capacities are not the only defining characteristics of a person.
G: they dispute the notion that higher mental capacities are a requirement for personhood.
H: the argument is irrelevant as they believe life begins at conception.
I: embryos are potential persons and therefore should have the same rights.
J: the argument is sound, but its validity fails due to a common logical fallacy.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about the argument Lee and George make regarding embryos and personhood. I remember that this is related to the debate on the moral status of embryos, especially in the context of abortion and stem-cell research.

The question states that someone argues embryos aren't persons because they don't exercise higher mental capacities. So, the opposing view is that personhood requires certain mental functions like reasoning, self-awareness, etc., which embryos obviously don't have.

Lee and George are responding to this argument. I think they're known for their defense of the position that human embryos are persons from conception. They probably argue against the idea that mental capacities are the basis for personhood.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it doesn't make sense to say a person exercises higher mental capacities. That seems off because people do use these capacities.

Option B claims mental capacities shouldn't determine personhood. That sounds more like their stance. They might argue that personhood is about being a human organism, not about the functions you can perform.

Option C suggests higher mental capacities are a potential. I think some people argue that embryos have the potential to develop these capacities, so they should be considered persons. Maybe that's what Lee and George say.

Option D talks about killing embryos being the same as killing you. That's a consequence argument, not directly addressing the mental capacity point.

Option E says embryos actually do use higher capacities, which doesn't make sense because embryos aren't developed enough.

Option F says higher capacities aren't the only defining traits. That's somewhat related but not directly addressing the potential aspect.

Option G says they dispute that higher capacities are required for personhood. That seems accurate because if Lee and George argue personhood isn't based on that, then G fits.

Option H is about life beginning at conception, which is a different argument and doesn't directly address the mental capacity point.

Option I says embryos are potential persons with the same rights. That's a possible argument, but I'm not sure if Lee and George make that exact claim.

Option J talks about a logical fallacy, which I don't think is their approach here.

Wait, I remember that Lee and George argue that being a person is an intrinsic aspect of being a human organism, regardless of the stage of development. They would say that the capacity for mental functions is inherent, even if not yet developed. So, the argument is about potential versus actuality.

So, when the original argument says embryos aren't persons because they don't exercise higher capacities, Lee and George would counter by saying that the ability is there potentially. So, the correct option would be C: the ability could be considered a potential, not an actuality.

But wait, another angle: they might argue that personhood isn't about the exercise of capacities but about being the kind of being that can have such capacities. So, maybe option G is better because they're disputing the requirement of higher capacities for personhood.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused between C and G. Let me think again. The original argument is that embryos lack these capacities, so they're not persons. Lee and George's response would be that personhood isn't based on currently exercising these capacities but on being the type of entity that can. So, they're saying the argument is wrong because it's based on the wrong criteria.

Alternatively, they might say that the potential to develop these capacities is sufficient. So, that would be option C.

Wait, in their book "Body-Self Dualism in Contemporary Ethics and Politics", Lee and George argue that personhood is based on the nature of the being as a rational animal, which has the inherent capacity for these functions, even if not yet developed. So, the capacity is there as a potential.

So, the answer would be C: the ability to exercise higher mental capacities could be considered a potential, not an actuality.

The question revolves around Lee and George's response to the argument that embryos are not persons because they do not exercise higher mental capacities. Lee and George are known for arguing that personhood is rooted in being a human organism, regardless of developmental stage. They counter the claim by emphasizing that the ability to exercise higher mental capacities is a potential inherent in embryos, even if not yet actualized.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option C** aligns with Lee and George's argument, as they suggest that the potential for higher mental capacities, rather than their current exercise, is what matters for personhood.
- Other options, such as **G**, while related, focus more on disputing the requirement of higher capacities for personhood, which is less precise than the potentiality argument.

Thus, the best answer is:

**C: the ability to exercise higher mental capacities could be considered a potential, not an actuality.**
