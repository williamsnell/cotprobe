Question:

Consider the number pattern 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29. Which rule could have been used to make the pattern?

Options:

A: Start with 5. Subtract 4 each time to get the next number.
B: Start with 5. Add 4 each time to get the next number.
C: Start with 5. Add 5 each time to get the next number.
D: Start with 0. Add 5 each time to get the next number.
E: Start with 9. Subtract 4 each time to get the next number.
F: Start with 1. Add 4 each time to get the next number.
G: Start with 0. Add 4 each time to get the next number.
H: Start with 0. Add 3 each time to get the next number.
I: Start with 5. Add 3 each time to get the next number.

Okay, let me try to figure out this pattern problem. So, the given sequence is 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29. I need to determine the rule that was used to create this pattern.

Hmm, I remember that in number patterns, the difference between consecutive terms is often constant, which would indicate an arithmetic sequence. Let me check the differences between each pair of numbers here.

So, 9 minus 5 is 4. Then, 13 minus 9 is also 4. Next, 17 minus 13 is 4 again. Oh, I see, each time we're adding 4 to get the next number. So the common difference is 4.

Now, looking at the options, I need to find the one that starts with 5 and adds 4 each time. Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A says to start with 5 and subtract 4 each time. Wait, no, subtracting would give us 5, 1, -3, etc., which doesn't match the given sequence. So A is incorrect.

Option B is starting with 5 and adding 4 each time. That sounds right because each step increases by 4. Let me verify: 5 +4 is 9, then 13, 17, and so on. Yep, that fits the sequence.

Option C suggests adding 5 each time. If I start at 5 and add 5, the next term would be 10, which isn't part of the sequence. So C is wrong.

Option D starts with 0 and adds 5. That would give 0,5,10,15... which doesn't match our sequence. So D's out.

Option E starts with 9 and subtracts 4. That would go 9,5,1,... which is the reverse of our sequence. So E isn't the rule used here.

Option F starts with 1 and adds 4. That would give 1,5,9,13,... Oh, wait, that's close. But our first term is 5, not 1. So F doesn't fit.

Option G starts with 0 and adds 4 each time. That would be 0,4,8,12,... which doesn't match the given sequence. So G is incorrect.

Option H starts with 0 and adds 3 each time. That would produce 0,3,6,9,... which doesn't align with our sequence. So H is wrong.

Option I starts with 5 and adds 3 each time. Let's see: 5 +3 is 8, which isn't the next term in the sequence (it's 9). So I is incorrect.

So the only option that fits is B: Start with 5 and add 4 each time.

The given sequence is 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29. To determine the rule, we observe that the difference between consecutive terms is constant: 9 - 5 = 4, 13 - 9 = 4, and so on. This indicates an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 4. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A** is incorrect because subtracting 4 would decrease the sequence.
- **B** is correct as starting with 5 and adding 4 each time matches the sequence.
- **C** is incorrect because adding 5 would not produce the given terms.
- **D** is incorrect as starting with 0 and adding 5 does not align with the sequence.
- **E** is incorrect because starting with 9 and subtracting 4 reverses the sequence.
- **F** is incorrect because starting with 1 and adding 4 does not match the first term.
- **G** is incorrect as starting with 0 and adding 4 does not align with the sequence.
- **H** is incorrect because starting with 0 and adding 3 does not match the sequence.
- **I** is incorrect as adding 3 to 5 does not produce the next term (9).

Thus, the correct rule is **B**: Start with 5 and add 4 each time.

Answer: B
