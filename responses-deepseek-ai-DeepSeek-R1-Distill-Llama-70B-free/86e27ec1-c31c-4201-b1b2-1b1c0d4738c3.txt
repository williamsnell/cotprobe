Okay, so I have this question about thermodynamics, specifically about what happens when a solid melts. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking about the entropy change and enthalpy changes during melting. The options are from A to J, each giving different combinations of positive, negative, or no changes in these two properties.

First, I need to recall what entropy and enthalpy represent. I remember that entropy is a measure of disorder in a system. When a solid melts into a liquid, the particles (molecules or atoms) gain more freedom to move around, right? So the system becomes more disordered. That would mean an increase in entropy. So the entropy change (ΔS) should be positive.

Next, enthalpy change (ΔH) is related to the heat absorbed or released at constant pressure. Melting requires heat because you need to break the bonds holding the solid structure together. So the system is absorbing heat, which means the process is endothermic. In endothermic processes, the enthalpy change is positive because the system gains enthalpy. So ΔH should be positive.

Wait, let me make sure. Enthalpy (H) is a state function, and for phase changes like melting, the enthalpy change is the heat at constant pressure. Since melting is from solid to liquid, it's an endothermic process because you're adding heat to break the crystal lattice. So yes, ΔH is positive.

Putting it together: when a solid melts, entropy increases (positive ΔS) and enthalpy increases (positive ΔH). So the correct option should have both positive changes.

Looking at the options:

Option H says positive enthalpy change and positive entropy change. That fits what I've reasoned.

Wait, let me check the other options just to be sure. For example, option J says negative enthalpy and positive entropy. No, because melting is endothermic, so ΔH is positive. Option H is positive for both.

I think I'm confident now. The answer should be H.

When a solid melts, the process involves an increase in disorder as the solid transitions to a liquid state, where particles have more freedom of movement. This results in a positive entropy change (ΔS > 0). Additionally, melting is an endothermic process because heat is absorbed to break the bonds in the crystal lattice, leading to a positive enthalpy change (ΔH > 0). 

Analyzing the options, the correct choice is the one that indicates both a positive entropy change and a positive enthalpy change. Option H matches these criteria.

Answer: H
