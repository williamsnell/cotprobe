Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about an observer seeing two flashes of light at different positions and times. Hmm, let me read it again.

The observer S is on the x-axis. They see a red flash at x = 1210 meters, and then after 4.96 microseconds, a blue flash at x = 480 meters. I need to find the measured time interval between these flashes. Wait, but wait—the question is about the measured time interval, so I think that's just the time between the two events as observed by S. Because the observer is at rest, right? So the time between the flashes is given as 4.96 µs. But wait, let me make sure.

Wait, no. Oh wait, the question says the observer sees the red flash, then after 4.96 µs, the blue. So the measured time interval is the time between the two events as measured by S. So the time interval is just 4.96 µs, right? So that would be option F.

But wait, wait. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh, are the flashes happening at different positions, so maybe I have to consider the time it takes for the light to reach the observer? Because in reality, when you see a flash, the time you see it depends on when the light left the source. So if the red flash is at 1210 m and the blue at 480 m, the light from the red has to travel further, so the actual time between the events (in S's frame) would be different from the time the observer sees them.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up events here. Let me clarify. The observer is at x=0, I assume, since they're on the x-axis but the problem doesn't specify their position. Wait, no, the problem says S is on the x-axis, but the events occur at x=1210 and x=480. So perhaps S is at a certain position, maybe at the origin, but the problem doesn't specify. Hmm. Wait, maybe S is at the origin (x=0), and the two events happen at x=1210 and x=480. So the observer measures the time between the two flashes, but the actual events happen at different times because the light has to reach the observer.

Wait no, the problem states that S "sees" the red flash at x=1210 m, then after 4.96 µs, the blue at x=480. So the time between the perceptions is the 4.96 µs. But the question is about the measured time interval between the flashes as per S. So that is exactly the 4.96 µs, which is option F.

Wait but perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the actual time between when the two events happened, considering the light travel time. Because if the red flash is at x=1210, the light takes time to reach S, and the blue at x=480, which is closer. So the actual time between the events would be when the red happened and when the blue happened, but the observer sees them with a delay.

Wait, let me think in terms of events. Let me denote the events as event R (red flash) and event B (blue flash). The observer S records the time of event R as t_R, and event B as t_B. The time interval measured by S is t_B - t_R.

But in reality, the events occur at x_R and t'_R, and x_B and t'_B. The light from event R takes time to reach S, and same for B.

So for event R, the flash occurs at x = 1210 m, at some time t'_R. The light (red) travels from x=1210 to S's position, let's say S is at x = 0, right? So the time it takes for the red light to reach S is (1210 m) / (speed of light c). Similarly, the blue flash occurs at x=480 m at time t'_B. The light from blue takes (480 m)/c to reach S.

The observer S will see the red flash at time t_R = t'_R + (1210/c), and the blue at t_B = t'_B + (480/c). The time interval according to S is t_B - t_R = (t'_B + 480/c) - (t'_R + 1210/c) = (t'_B - t'_R) + (480-1210)/c.

But wait, we don't know the actual times t'_R and t'_B. But the problem states that S sees the red first, then 4.96 µs later, the blue. So t_B - t_R = 4.96 µs.

But the question is asking, what is the measured time interval between these flashes? Wait, perhaps the question is just taking about the time between when S sees them, which is given as 4.96 µs. So the answer would be F.

But I'm a bit confused because the options include F as 4.96, which is the given time between seeing the flashes. So the measured time interval is 4.96 µs. So the answer is F.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question, and the actual time between the events (the proper time) is different. But the question clearly states that the observer measures a time interval, so it's the 4.96 µs.

Wait, but the problem says "the measured time interval between these flashes". So that's the time between the two events as measured by S, which is simply 4.96 µs. So the correct answer is F.

The observer S, located on the x-axis, sees a red flash at \( x = 1210 \, \text{m} \) and then, after \( 4.96 \, \mu\text{s} \), a blue flash at \( x = 480 \, \text{m} \). The question asks for the measured time interval between these flashes. 

The key point is that the measured time interval is the time difference between when S observes the two flashes. Since the problem explicitly states that the red flash is seen first and the blue flash is seen \( 4.96 \, \mu\text{s} \) later, this directly gives the measured time interval as \( 4.96 \, \mu\text{s} \). 

While the flashes occur at different positions, the problem does not require calculating the actual time difference between the events themselves (e.g., accounting for light travel times). Instead, it focuses solely on the time interval between the observations, which is explicitly provided as \( 4.96 \, \mu\text{s} \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**F: 4.96**
