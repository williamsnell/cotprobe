Okay, so I have this question about the Black-Scholes model for a perpetual American option. Hmm, I remember that perpetual options don't have an expiration date, so they're a bit different from regular options. The question provides some values and asks for h1. 

Let me see, the given are: h1 + h2 equals 7/9, the risk-free rate is 5%, and the volatility σ is 0.30. I need to find h1.

Wait, in the Black-Scholes model, for a perpetual American option, there are specific formulas for the critical stock prices, h1 and h2. I think h1 is the lower boundary where the option is exercised, and h2 is the upper boundary. Or maybe it's the other way around? I'm a bit confused. Oh right, I think h1 is the lower boundary because when the stock price falls below h1, it's optimal to exercise the put option, and when it rises above h2, you exercise the call. Or maybe I have that mixed up. Wait no, wait, for a put option, if the stock price goes below a certain point, you exercise it. For a call, when it goes above. But this question doesn't specify whether it's a call or put, but since both h1 and h2 are given, perhaps it's a general case.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think. The standard formula for a perpetual American option involves solving for h1 and h2. I think the equations are something like:

h1 = (r * h2) / (r + (σ²/2)) 
and h2 = (h1 * (σ²/2)) + h1 * r 

Wait, no, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, I remember that h1 and h2 satisfy certain equations involving the risk-free rate and volatility.

Wait, another approach. The formula for a perpetual American put option is known. The critical stock price S* is given by S* = (X * r) / (r + (σ²/2)). But wait, no, that's for the exercise boundary. Oh wait, in the context of the question, perhaps h1 and h2 are the solutions to a quadratic equation.

I think the correct approach is to set up the equation for the sum h1 + h2. From what I remember, the sum h1 + h2 is equal to (2 * r * X) / (σ²). Wait, but wait, in the problem, X isn't given. Oh wait, wait, no, that formula might not be correct. Alternatively, I think that for the sum, there's a specific equation involving the risk-free rate and volatility.

Wait, let's try to recall the setup. For a perpetual American option, whether call or put, the value can be expressed in terms of the stock price, and the critical stock prices h1 and h2 are the boundaries where it's optimal to exercise. The equations governing h1 and h2 come from the boundary conditions and the differential equation.

The general approach is to solve the differential equation from the Black-Scholes model with appropriate boundary conditions. For a put option, when S = h1, the option is exercised, so the value equals X - h1. Also, as S approaches infinity, the put option value tends to zero. Similarly for a call, but perhaps the question is about a put since h1 and h2 are given.

Wait, perhaps the sum h1 + h2 is given as 7/9, and we need to find h1. So, I think the key is to find the product of h1 and h2, and then use the sum to solve for each.

Wait, I recall that for a perpetual American call option, the critical stock price h2 satisfies h2 = (r X)/(r + σ²/2). But wait, that's for a call. For a put, the critical stock price is h1 = (r X)/(r - σ²/2), but that requires that r > σ²/2, which it is in this case since r is 5% (0.05), σ is 0.30, so σ² is 0.09, so σ²/2 is 0.045. So 0.05 > 0.045, so it's okay.

Wait, but in the question, it's an American perpetual option, but are we considering a put or a call? Because the formulas for h1 and h2 would differ. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about a put, so that the two conditions are h1 + h2 = 7/9 and another equation involving their product.

Wait, perhaps for a put option, the sum of h1 and h2 is given by some formula. Alternatively, I think the product h1 * h2 = (X^2 * r) / (σ²). Wait, that might be the case. Let me think, in the case of a perpetual put, the value is P = (X - S) * (h2/h1), where h1 is the critical price. Wait, but I might be getting confused with the specific formulas.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the fact that for a perpetual American put, the critical prices h1 and h2 satisfy the following equations:

h1 = X * ( (r - (σ² / 2)) / (r + (σ² / 2)) )

Wait, that formula doesn't ring a bell. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to set up the equations.

Wait, I think that for a perpetual American put option, the critical price h is given by h = X * ( (r + σ² / 2) ) / (r) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look for the relation between h1 and h2.

Wait, another approach: for a perpetual American put option, the critical stock price h1 satisfies the equation:

h1 = X * [ (r - (σ²/2)) / (r + (σ²/2)) ) ].

Wait, that might be right. Let me plug in the numbers. If I can find h1 in terms of X, r, and σ, but the problem is that X isn't given. Hmm, perhaps the product of h1 and h2 equals X² * (r/(σ²)). Alternatively, maybe h1 * h2 = X². I'm not certain.

Wait, the problem gives h1 + h2 = 7/9, and we're to find h1. So perhaps I need another equation involving h1 and h2. Let me think about the Black-Scholes equations for perpetual options.

In the Black-Scholes model for a perpetual American put option, the value P(S) satisfies the differential equation:

(σ² S² / 2) P''(S) + r S P'(S) - r P(S) = 0.

The boundary conditions are P(h1) = X - h1, and as S approaches infinity, P(S) approaches zero. The solution to this equation is P(S) = A S^γ1 + B S^γ2, where γ1 and γ2 are the roots of the characteristic equation.

The characteristic equation is (σ²/2) γ^2 + r γ - r = 0. Solving this quadratic equation, the roots are:

γ = [ -r ± sqrt(r² + 2 σ² r) ] / (σ²).

Hmm, but this might be getting too detailed. Alternatively, perhaps the critical prices are given by h1 = (r X)/(r - (σ²/2)) and h2 = (r X)/(r + (σ²/2)).

Wait, that makes sense because if you set h1 as the lower boundary and h2 as the upper, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, perhaps for a put option, the critical price is h1 = (r X)/(r + (σ²/2)). Wait, no, that's for a call option. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe for a put, the critical price h is given by h = (r X)/(r - (σ²/2)). Because when the stock price falls below h, you exercise the put. So in that case, h1 would be that value.

But in this question, both h1 and h2 are given, and their sum is 7/9. So perhaps the product of h1 and h2 equals X²*(r/(σ²)), but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the equations for h1 and h2. Let me try to write down the two equations I know:

1. h1 + h2 = 7/9
2. From the Black-Scholes, h1 * h2 = (X² r) / (σ²) ?

Wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the product is h1 * h2 = X² (r/(σ²)). Hmm, but without knowing X, that's not immediately helpful.

Wait, but maybe there's another way. Let me think about the ratio of h1 to h2.

Wait, perhaps the ratio h1/h2 is given by (r - (σ²/2))/(r + (σ²/2)).

So, let me write that as h1 = h2 * [ (r - (σ²/2)) / (r + (σ²/2)) ) ]

Let me compute this ratio. Given r = 0.05, σ = 0.3, so σ²/2 = (0.09)/2 = 0.045.

So, the numerator is 0.05 - 0.045 = 0.005.

Denominator is 0.05 + 0.045 = 0.095.

So the ratio is 0.005 / 0.095 ≈ 0.05263.

So h1 ≈ h2 * 0.05263.

But we also know that h1 + h2 = 7/9 ≈ 0.7778.

So substituting h1 = 0.05263 h2 into h1 + h2 = 0.7778:

0.05263 h2 + h2 = 0.7778

h2 (1 + 0.05263) = 0.7778

h2 * 1.05263 ≈ 0.7778

So h2 ≈ 0.7778 / 1.05263 ≈ Let's compute that.

0.7778 ÷ 1.05263 ≈ Let me compute:

1.05263 × 0.738 ≈ 0.7778? Let's see: 1.05263 × 0.738.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

0.7778 divided by 1.05263.

So 1.05263 × 0.738: 1 times 0.738 is 0.738, 0.05263 × 0.738 ≈ approx 0.0388. So total approx 0.738 + 0.0388 = 0.7768, which is close to 0.7778.

So h2 ≈ 0.738 approximately.

Then h1 would be approximately 0.05263 × 0.738 ≈ 0.0388.

Wait, but then h1 + h2 ≈ 0.738 + 0.0388 ≈ 0.7768, which is close to 0.7778, but not exact. Maybe I made a rounding error.

Alternatively, perhaps I can solve it more accurately.

Let me let h1 = k * h2, where k = (r - σ²/2)/(r + σ²/2).

Given r = 0.05, σ²/2 = 0.045. So numerator is 0.005, denominator 0.095. So k = 0.005 / 0.095 ≈ 0.0526315789.

Then, h1 + h2 = k h2 + h2 = h2 (1 + k) = 7/9 ≈ 0.777777...

So h2 = (7/9) / (1 + k) = (7/9) / (1 + 0.0526315789) ≈ (0.777777...) / 1.0526315789.

Let me compute that more precisely.

Compute 7/9 ÷ 1.0526315789:

7/9 ≈ 0.7777777778.

1.0526315789 ≈ 1.0526315789.

So 0.7777777778 ÷ 1.0526315789.

Let me compute this division.

Let me compute 0.7777777778 ÷ 1.0526315789.

Multiply numerator and denominator by 10^9 to make it manageable:

777,777,777.8 ÷ 1,052,631,578.9.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute as a decimal.

Using a calculator approach:

Compute 0.7777777778 ÷ 1.0526315789.

Approximately:

1.0526315789 × 0.738 ≈ 0.7777.

Wait, 1.0526315789 × 0.738 = ?

Compute 1 × 0.738 = 0.738.

0.0526315789 × 0.738 ≈ Let's compute 0.0526315789 × 700 = approx 36.842, but wait, 0.0526315789 × 0.738 is:

0.0526315789 × 0.7 = 0.0368421292

0.0526315789 × 0.038 = 0.0019999999

So total ≈ 0.0368421292 + 0.0019999999 ≈ 0.0388421291.

So 0.738 + 0.038842 ≈ 0.776842, which is very close to 0.7777777778.

The difference is about 0.7777777778 - 0.776842 = 0.0009357778.

So perhaps h2 is approximately 0.738 + (0.0009357778)/(1.0526315789) ≈ 0.738 + 0.000888 ≈ 0.738888.

So h2 ≈ 0.738888, and h1 = k * h2 ≈ 0.0526315789 × 0.738888.

0.0526315789 × 0.738888 ≈ Let's compute:

0.05 × 0.738888 = 0.0369444

0.0026315789 × 0.738888 ≈ approx 0.0019432.

So total ≈ 0.0369444 + 0.0019432 ≈ 0.0388876.

So h1 ≈ 0.0388876.

Wait, but the sum h1 + h2 would be 0.738888 + 0.0388876 ≈ 0.7777756, which is very close to 7/9 ≈ 0.7777777778.

So that seems correct.

But wait, the question is to find h1. The options given don't have 0.0388. The options are A: 0.50, B:2.00, C:1.75, D:1.40, E:0.75, F:1.10, G:1.51, H:1.25, I:2.50, J:1.00.

Wait, none of these are close to 0.0388. So either I'm making a mistake, or perhaps I have the wrong approach. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I got h1 and h2 backwards? Because in the problem statement, it's an American perpetual option, but perhaps it's a call option instead of a put. Let me try that.

For a call option, the critical stock price h2 is given by h2 = (r X)/(r + σ²/2). So in that case, h2 would be higher, but again, without knowing X, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing h1 and h2. Let me think again. Maybe h1 is the higher boundary and h2 the lower? That would change things.

Wait, no, in the case of a put option, the critical price is below the strike, so h1 < X. But perhaps in the question, h1 is the higher boundary, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that for a perpetual American option, the sum of h1 and h2 is equal to (2 r X)/(σ²). So if I have h1 + h2 = (2 r X)/(σ²) = 7/9, and then perhaps another equation for the product of h1 and h2.

Wait, another formula I found in my notes: h1 * h2 = X² (r)/(σ²). So if I have h1 + h2 = 7/9, and h1 h2 = X² (r/σ²), then perhaps I can write a quadratic equation in terms of h1 and h2.

But without knowing X, I can't proceed numerically. So maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, alternative approach. Maybe the question is referring to a specific formula that gives h1 in terms of the given parameters without X. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the options given are in terms of X, but that's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the value of h1 is given as a multiple of X, but the question doesn't specify, so I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is using the Merton model for a perpetual option, and the equations for h1 and h2 can be derived from the option's value.

Wait, I think the value of a perpetual American put option is P = (X - h1) * (h2/h1), where h1 and h2 are the critical prices. But without knowing the option's value, I can't use this.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a formula that gives h1 in terms of h2 and the given parameters.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think differently. Let me look at the options again. The options are:

A: 0.50
B:2.00
C:1.75
D:1.40
E:0.75
F:1.10
G:1.51
H:1.25
I:2.50
J:1.00

Wait, these are all greater than 0.7 except for A, E, and J. But in my previous calculation, h1 was about 0.0388, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in assuming it's a put option. Maybe it's a call option.

Wait, for a perpetual American call option, the critical price h2 is given by h2 = (r X)/(r + σ²/2). So let's compute that.

Given r = 0.05, σ = 0.3, so σ² =
