Question:

To study the effect of music on piecework output at a clothing manufacturer, two experimental treatments are planned: day-long classical music for one group versus day-long light rock music for another. Which one of the following groups would serve best as a control for this study?

Options:

A: A third group that hears day-long R & B music
B: A third group that hears a mix of classical, light rock, and other genres of music
C: A third group that hears day-long country music
D: A third group that hears day-long pop music
E: A third group that hears day-long jazz music
F: A third group that hears classical music every morning and light rock every afternoon
G: A third group that hears different music each day from various genres
H: A third group that randomly hears either classical or light rock music each day
I: A third group for which no music is played
J: A third group that hears music for half the day

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about experimental design, specifically about control groups in studies. Let me read the question again.

The scenario is that a clothing manufacturer wants to study the effect of music on piecework output. They're planning two experimental treatments: one group listens to classical music all day, and another listens to light rock music all day. The question is asking which group would serve best as a control for this study.

Hmm, I remember that in experiments, the control group is the group that doesn't receive the experimental treatment, so it's used as a baseline to compare against. The purpose is to see if the experimental treatment actually causes any effect.

Wait, but here there are two treatments, classical and light rock. So normally, the control group wouldn't receive either of these. But wait, sometimes you might have more than one control group, but in this case, the question is asking for the best single control group.

So the possible options are A to J, each suggesting a different type of control. Let me go through them.

Option A: A third group that hears day-long R & B music. Well, that's another genre, but it's still a specific type of music. So this would be another treatment, not a control. The control should be without the treatment or a standard condition.

Option B: Mix of genres. That's a bit different, but it's still music. So this is another treatment, maybe as a varied condition, but not a control.

Option C: Country music. Again, another type of music. So same issue as A.

Option D: Pop music. Same problem. Still a treatment.

Option E: Jazz. Another music genre, so another treatment.

Option F: Classical in the morning, light rock in the afternoon. That's mixing the two treatments. So this is a different condition, but not a control because it's still applying the treatments, just in parts of the day.

Option G: Different music each day. That's varying the treatment, so again, not a control.

Option H: Randomly hears either classical or light rock each day. Hmm, that might be more like a randomized approach, but it's still exposing them to one of the two treatments. So it's more like a combined treatment group rather than a control.

Option I: No music played. Oh, this seems promising. Because the control group should not be exposed to the experimental variables, which in this case are the specific music types. So if the other groups are getting either classical or light rock, the control would have no music at all. That way, any differences can be compared to a baseline without any music influence.

Option J: Music for half the day. Well, that's still applying music, just less. So it's a different treatment condition, not a control.

Wait, but in some experiments, the control might have the standard condition, which could be whatever is usual in the workplace. If the factory normally plays music, then the control would be that usual music. But in this case, the question doesn't mention any existing music. It just says two groups are getting specific music. So the default would be no music, making I the correct control.

Alternatively, sometimes a control might have a placebo, like silence, but in this case, I think silence is the control. So the best answer is I.

The question involves determining the best control group for a study examining the effect of music on piecework output at a clothing manufacturer. Two experimental groups are exposed to classical music and light rock music, respectively. The control group should serve as a baseline to compare against the experimental treatments, meaning it should not be exposed to either of the experimental conditions.

- **Options A to E** involve different music genres (R & B, country, pop, jazz), which are additional treatments and not a control.  
- **Option F** mixes the two experimental treatments (classical in the morning and light rock in the afternoon), which is still an experimental condition.  
- **Option G** involves varying music genres daily, which is another experimental condition.  
- **Option H** randomly assigns either classical or light rock music, which combines the two treatments rather than serving as a control.  
- **Option J** involves music for half the day, which is still a treatment, just at a reduced intensity.  

The best control group is **Option I**, where no music is played. This provides a baseline condition without any exposure to the experimental variables (classical or light rock music), allowing for a valid comparison to assess the effects of the music treatments.

Answer: I
