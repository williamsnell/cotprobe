Okay, so I have this question about Piaget's stages of development, specifically the preoperational stage. Hmm, I remember that Piaget's theory has four stages: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational. Each stage brings new abilities.

The question is asking about a key accomplishment of the preoperational stage. The options are A through J, each with different developmental milestones. Let me think about what each stage entails.

The sensorimotor stage is from birth to about 2 years. That's where object permanence develops, like understanding that objects continue to exist even when they're out of sight. So E, the object concept, is probably from the sensorimotor stage.

Then comes the preoperational stage, roughly from 2 to 7 years. I remember that during this stage, children start using symbols and language. Oh, right, the symbolic function. That's when kids can use words and symbols to represent the world. So maybe D is the answer.

Wait, what about egocentrism? That's also a part of the preoperational stage, like not being able to see things from another person's perspective. So G, understanding others' perspectives, might not be a key accomplishment here. Actually, the opposite; preoperational children are egocentric.

Another thing about the preoperational stage is that they lack conservation. Conservation is the understanding that certain properties remain the same despite changes in appearance. Like knowing that the amount of water stays the same even if you pour it into a different shaped glass. Conservation is a big part of the concrete operational stage, which comes after preoperational. So J, conservation, isn't correct here. 

Option A is cause and effect. I think that's more sensorimotor as well, like when babies learn that shaking a rattle makes noise. So A might not be it.

Deductive reasoning (B) and abstract reasoning (F) sound more like the formal operational stage, where adolescents and adults can think logically and abstractly. So B and F are probably not right for preoperational.

Option C is reasoning about abstract concepts, which again seems more like the formal stage. And I is handling multiple variables, which also sounds like formal operations, where they can think systematically.

So putting it all together, the symbolic function (D) emerges in the preoperational stage. That's when children start using symbols, like language, to represent their world, even if their thinking is still egocentric and they can't conserve.

The preoperational stage, according to Jean Piaget, occurs between approximately 2 to 7 years of age. During this stage, children develop the ability to use symbols and language to represent the world, which is known as the symbolic function. This is a key accomplishment of this stage. Other options, such as conservation (J) and deductive reasoning (B), are associated with later stages like the concrete operational and formal operational stages, respectively. Egocentrism, a characteristic of this stage, means children struggle with understanding others' perspectives (G). Therefore, the correct answer is the emergence of the symbolic function.

Answer: D
