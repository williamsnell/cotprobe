Okay, so I've got this problem here about the Judith Franklyn Corporation and their on-the-job training expenses. The question is asking me to find the cost per employee. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to figure out the total expenses. The problem lists several categories: part-time instruction, janitorial services, books, supplies, and miscellaneous. I should add all these amounts together.

Let me list them out again to make sure I don't miss anything. 

- Part-time instruction: $114,770
- Janitorial services: $6,080
- Books: $12,370
- Supplies: $4,160
- Miscellaneous: $6,150

Alright, I'll start adding them one by one. Maybe I can do it in parts to avoid mistakes.

First, add part-time instruction and janitorial services. That's 114,770 + 6,080. Let me compute that. 114,770 plus 6,000 is 120,770, and then plus 80 makes 120,850. So that sum is $120,850.

Next, I'll add the books expense. So 120,850 + 12,370. Hmm, 120k plus 12k is 132k, then 850 + 370 is 1,220. So that brings it to $134,120.

Wait, let me double-check that addition. 120,850 + 12,370. Let me break it down: 120,000 +12,000 is 132,000. Then 850 + 370 is 1,220. So 132,000 + 1,220 equals 133,220? Oh wait, no, I think I made a mistake there. Because 12,370 is 12 thousand 370, not 12,370. Wait no, 120,850 +12,370 = 133,220. Because 120k +12k is 132k, 850 +370 is 1,220, so total is 133,220. Right.

Then I have to add supplies: $4,160. So 133,220 + 4,160. Let me calculate that. 133k plus 4k is 137k, and 220 +160 is 380. So $137,380.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute 133,220 +4,160. 133,220 +4,000 is 137,220, then +160 is 137,380. Yes, that's correct.

Now, add the miscellaneous expenses of $6,150. So 137,380 +6,150. 137k plus 6k is 143k, and 380 +150 is 530. So total expenses are $143,530.

Wait, but let me confirm: 137,380 +6,150. 137,380 +6,000 is 143,380, then +150 is 143,530. Yep, that's right.

So the total cost is $143,530. Now, this was for training 1,240 employees. So to find the cost per employee, I need to divide the total by the number of employees.

So per employee cost = total cost / number of employees = 143,530 / 1,240.

Hmm, let me compute that. Let me see, 143,530 divided by 1,240.

Wait, maybe it's easier to simplify the numbers. Let me see. Both numerator and denominator can be divided by 10, so that's 14,353 / 124.

Wait, alternative approach: 1,240 times what equals 143,530.

I can do this division step by step. Let's see:

124 times 100 is 12,400. 124 * 100 = 12,400.

But we're dealing with 1,240 employees. So let me think in terms of 1,240.

Wait, 1,240 * 100 is 124,000. So 124,000 is 100 per employee. Because 1,240 * 100 = 124,000.

But the total is 143,530. So 124,000 from 143,530 leaves a remainder of 19,530.

So 19,530 divided by 1,240 employees. Let me compute 19,530 / 1,240.

Hmm. Let's see, 1,240 * 15 is 18,600 (because 1,240*10=12,400, 1,240*5=6,200; 12,400+6,200=18,600). So 15 would give 18,600. Subtract that from 19,530: 19,530 -18,600=930.

So 15 with a remainder of 930. Now, 930 divided by 1,240. Well, that's less than 1, so 0.75 perhaps.

Wait, 1,240 * 0.75 = 930. Because 1,240 * 0.75 = 1,240 * 3/4 = 930.

So 15.75.

Wait, because 15 *1,240=18,600 and 0.75*1,240=930. So 18,600+930=19,530.

So the total per employee is 100 + 15.75 = $115.75.

Wait, wait, that can't be right because 100 +15.75 is 115.75, which is option I.

But wait, let me see if I did that correctly. Because 1,240 * 115.75 should equal 143,530.

Let me compute 1,240 * 100 = 124,000.

1,240 * 15 = 18,600.

1,240 * 0.75 = 930.

Adding them together: 124,000 +18,600=142,600. 142,600 +930=143,530. Yes, that's correct.

So per employee cost is $115.75.

Looking at the options, option I is $115.75. So the answer should be I.

The total cost of the on-the-job training is calculated by summing all expenses:

- Part-time instruction: $114,770  
- Janitorial services: $6,080  
- Books: $12,370  
- Supplies: $4,160  
- Miscellaneous: $6,150  

Adding these together:  
\[
114,770 + 6,080 + 12,370 + 4,160 + 6,150 = 143,530
\]  

The total cost is **$143,530**. To find the cost per employee, divide the total cost by the number of employees (1,240):  
\[
\frac{143,530}{1,240} = 115.75
\]  

Thus, the cost of the on-the-job training per employee is **$115.75**, which corresponds to option **I**.
