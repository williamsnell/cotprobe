Okay, so I have this chemistry question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it carefully. The question is about Lewis structures and hybridization of central atoms in certain molecules. The molecules given are CO2, CO3^2-, NO2^-, and NO3^-. I need to determine which of these have sp² hybridization around the central atom.

Hmm, I remember that hybridization is related to the number of electron domains around the central atom. Like, sp³ is for four domains (tetrahedral), sp² for three (trigonal planar), and so on. So each molecule's central atom will have a certain number of electron domains, which includes bonds and lone pairs.

Let me go through each molecule one by one.

Starting with CO2. Carbon dioxide has a central carbon atom. Carbon usually has four bonds. In CO2, each oxygen is double bonded to the carbon. So, the structure is O=C=O. The central carbon has double bonds to two oxygens. Wait, but in terms of electron domains, each double bond counts as one domain. So, the central carbon has two double bonds and no lone pairs. That makes two electron domains, right? So that's like a linear geometry. Wait, but wait, two domains would mean sp hybridization, not sp². Oh wait, wait. No, wait. Hybridization is based on the number of regions of electron density. So, for CO2, the carbon is double bonded to each O. So, the central carbon has two double bonds and no lone pairs. So two regions, so sp hybridization. So CO2's central atom is sp hybridized, not sp². So any option that includes CO2 as sp² is incorrect. Hmm, but wait maybe I'm getting that wrong. Wait, double bonds are a single region each, right? So two regions would be sp. So CO2's central C is sp, not sp². So any answer that includes CO2 as sp² is wrong. So the options that include CO2 as part of the correct answer are incorrect. Let me check the options again. Option B is CO2 and CO3^2-; D is CO2 and NO3^-; H is CO2 and NO2^-. So those would all include CO2 as having sp², which I'm now thinking is incorrect. So perhaps the correct answer doesn't include CO2.

Next, CO3^2-. The carbonate ion. The central carbon is bonded to three oxygen atoms. One of them is double bonded. So, the structure is with three regions of electron density. Wait, the structure is trigonal planar. So the central carbon has three electron domains. So that's sp² hybridization. Because three regions (double bond counts as one, single as one, etc.) So for CO3^2-, the central C has three regions, so sp². So CO3^2- has sp².

Moving on to NO2^-. The nitrite ion. The central nitrogen atom. Let me think about its structure. Nitrogen typically has five valence electrons. In NO2^-, there are two oxygen atoms. Each O is bonded, likely one with a double bond and one with a single. Wait, or maybe resonance structures. So the structure is bent, with resonance between the two oxygens. So each O is bonded to N with one double and one single bond, but in reality, it's delocalized. So the central N has two bonding regions and one lone pair? Or wait, let me think about the Lewis structure. Nitrogen has five valence electrons. The molecule has a charge of -1. So total valence electrons: N has 5, each O has 6, but since it's an ion, add one more electron (because charge is -1), so 5 + 2*6 +1 = 18 electrons. So 18 electrons in the structure.

Building the structure: N in the center, two O atoms attached. So each O probably has a double bond, but wait, that might not add up. Alternatively, one double bond and one single bond. Let me count: double bond has 4 electrons, single has 2. So 4 + 2 = 6 electrons used in bonds. But there are 18 electrons, so subtracting the bonding electrons (6), leaves 12 electrons as lone pairs. So distributing those: each O would have lone pairs. Let me see: each O in a single bond would have 3 lone pairs (6 electrons), and the O in a double bond would have two lone pairs (4 electrons). Wait, let me try to structure it.

Alternatively, the structure is that N is in the center, with one double bond and one single bond. So one O is double bonded (sharing 4 electrons), the other is single bonded (sharing 2). So the bonds account for 6 electrons. The remaining 12 are lone pairs. So each O in the double bond has 6 - (bond electrons) = 6 - 4 = 2 lone pair electrons? No, wait, each O in a double bond would have 4 lone electrons (two lone pairs), and the single bonded O would have 6 lone electrons (three lone pairs). So N has a lone pair? Let me check the formal charges.

Nitrogen's formal charge: valence electrons (5) minus non-bonding electrons (lone pair electrons) minus half bonding electrons. So in the structure where N has a double bond and a single bond, how many lone pairs on N? Let's see:

Each O in double bond has 4 lone electrons, each O in single has 6. So for N: double bond (counts as 4 electrons, but in bonding, so half is 2), single bond (counts as 2, half is 1). So bonding electrons for N: 2 + 1 = 3. Lone pair electrons: if N has one lone pair, that's 2 electrons. So formal charge on N is 5 - (2) - (3) = 0. Hmm, that works.

So the structure has N with a lone pair. So the central N has three regions of electron density: two bonding (the double and single bond) and one lone pair. So three regions, which is trigonal planar arrangement, so sp² hybridization. So NO2^- has sp² around the central N.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, if the central atom has a lone pair, the geometry changes. Wait, but the hybridization is determined by the number of regions (domains), regardless of whether they are bonding or lone pairs. So in NO2^-, the N has three regions (two bonds, one lone pair), so sp² hybridization. So yes, NO2^- has sp².

Finally, NO3^-. The nitrate ion. Central N atom. Let me think. Nitrogen has five valence electrons. Each O has six. The ion has a charge of -1, so total electrons: 5 (N) + 3*6 (Os) + 1 (charge) = 5 + 18 +1 = 24 electrons.

The structure is with N in the center, each O attached. All three O atoms are bonded with one double bond each, but that's not possible because that would require 3 double bonds, which would be 6 electrons (each double is 4 electrons? Wait, no. Each double bond is two pairs, so 4 electrons. So three double bonds would be 12 electrons. But the total electrons are 24, so bonds take 12, leaving 12 as lone pairs. Each O in a double bond has 6 - 4 = 2 lone pair electrons, which is one lone pair. So each O would have one lone pair.

But wait, that would make each O have a formal charge of 6 - (2 lone pair electrons + 4 bonding) = 6 - 6 = 0. Nitrogen's formal charge: 5 - (0 lone pairs? No, wait. If N has three double bonds, each double bond is 4 electrons, so 3 *4 =12 bonding electrons. Half is 6. So for N: 5 - (lone pairs?) Wait, how many lone pairs does N have? Let me calculate.

Wait, if N is bonded with three double bonds, that's three regions. So the central N has three bonding regions and no lone pairs. Because in the nitrate ion, each O is bonded once, and there's resonance. So the structure is trigonal planar. So the central N has three regions of electron density, so sp² hybridization. Because hybridization depends on the number of regions, whether bonding or lone pairs. So even if the N has no lone pairs, as long as it has three regions, it's sp². So NO3^- has sp² hybridization.

Wait, but earlier I thought that NO2^- has sp². So the molecules that have sp² are CO3^2-, NO2^-, and NO3^-? Because CO2 was sp. So looking back, the question is which exhibit sp² hybridization. So the options are:

Looking at the options:

Option J: CO3^2-, NO2^-, NO3^-

Option F: CO3^2- and NO3^-

Option E: NO2^- and NO3^-

Wait, the question is about which molecules exhibit sp². So which of the given options correctly lists all the molecules with sp².

So CO3^2-: yes.

NO2^-: yes.

NO3^-: yes.

So all three have sp². Looking at the options, option J is CO3^2-, NO2^-, and NO3^-. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. CO3^2-: 3 regions (trigonal planar), so sp².

NO2^-: 3 regions (two bonds, one lone pair), so sp².

NO3^-: 3 regions (three bonds, no lone pairs), so sp².

So all three are sp². So the correct answer would be J.

But wait, looking back at the options:

Option J says CO3^2-, NO2^-, and NO3^-.

So the correct answer is J.

Wait, but what about the initial thought that CO2 is sp, so any option that includes CO2 is wrong. So for example, option D says CO2 and NO3^-, which would be wrong because CO2 is sp, not sp². So the answer can't be D.

So the correct answer is J.

To determine which molecules exhibit sp² hybridization around the central atom, we analyze the number of electron domains (bonding and lone pairs) for each central atom. Hybridization is determined by the total number of electron domains, with sp² corresponding to three domains (trigonal planar geometry).

1. **CO₂**: The central carbon atom is double bonded to two oxygen atoms, resulting in two electron domains (both bonding). This corresponds to sp hybridization, not sp². Therefore, CO₂ does not exhibit sp² hybridization.

2. **CO₃²⁻**: The central carbon atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms, with one double bond and two single bonds. This creates three electron domains (two bonding and one lone pair). The geometry is trigonal planar, so the central carbon exhibits sp² hybridization.

3. **NO₂⁻**: The central nitrogen atom is bonded to two oxygen atoms, with one double bond and one single bond, along with one lone pair. This results in three electron domains (two bonding and one lone pair). The geometry is bent, but the hybridization is still sp² due to the three domains.

4. **NO₃⁻**: The central nitrogen atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms, with resonance delocalizing the bonds. The nitrogen has three electron domains (all bonding, no lone pairs). The geometry is trigonal planar, so the central nitrogen exhibits sp² hybridization.

From this analysis, the molecules that exhibit sp² hybridization are **CO₃²⁻**, **NO₂⁻**, and **NO₃⁻**. The correct answer is:

**J: CO₃²⁻, NO₂⁻, and NO₃⁻**
