Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Alright, the question is about an ideal gas undergoing an isentropic expansion. I remember that isentropic means it's a reversible and adiabatic process, so no heat is exchanged with the surroundings. The question is asking for the work done during this process.

The given data includes the initial volume, which is 0.1 ft³. Wait, wait, but wait—those are Imperial units, and I'm more familiar with SI units. Oh, right, but maybe I can convert them later. The initial temperature is 115°C. Oh, I should convert that to Kelvin because all the gas equations use absolute temperature. So 115 + 273.15 is 388.15 K.

The initial pressure is 690 kPa, and it expands to a final pressure of 138 kPa. The specific heats are given too: c_v is 0.7201 kJ/kg·K and c_p is 1.0048 kJ/kg·K. Oh, right, and the process is isentropic, so entropy change is zero.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. For an isentropic process, the work done can be calculated using the formula W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2) / (γ - 1), where γ is the heat capacity ratio, c_p over c_v. But wait, do I know the specific gas constant R for this gas? Or maybe I can find it from the given c_p and c_v. Oh right, because for ideal gases, c_p - c_v = R. So R is 1.0048 - 0.7201, which is 0.2847 kJ/kg·K. Wait, yeah, because R is the specific gas constant.

But wait, maybe I should first find the mass of the gas in the chamber. Because the work done would be in kJ, so I need the mass involved. Using the ideal gas law, PV = mRT. So I can find mass m = (P1 V1) / (R T1).

Let me note down the steps:

1. Convert initial volume from ft³ to m³ because all other units are in SI.
2. Convert initial temperature from °C to K.
3. Calculate the mass m using ideal gas law: m = (P1 V1) / (R T1)
4. Determine the heat capacity ratio γ = c_p / c_v.
5. For isentropic process, use the work formula W = m * (u2 - u1) where u is internal energy. Or alternatively, since it's isentropic and adiabatic, the work can be found using the formula involving temperatures and the heat capacity at constant volume.

Wait, another approach: For an adiabatic process, Q=0, so ΔU = W. And for an ideal gas, ΔU = m c_v ΔT. So W = m c_v (T2 - T1). But since it's expansion, T2 will be lower than T1, so W will be positive if work is done by the gas.

But wait, alternatively, when the gas expands, it does work on the surroundings, so work done by the gas is positive. So the formula would be W = m c_v (T1 - T2), because T2 < T1.

So I'll need to find T2, the final temperature. But how? Since the process is isentropic, the relation between temperatures and pressures (or volumes) can be applied. For an isentropic process, T1 P1^( (1-γ)/γ ) = T2 P2^( (1-γ)/γ ). Alternatively, the formula can be written as (T2 / T1) = (P2 / P1)^( (γ-1)/γ ). Yeah, that's right.

So first, I'll calculate γ. γ = c_p / c_v = 1.0048 / 0.7201 ≈ let's see. Let me compute that: 1.0048 / 0.7201 ≈ approximately 1.394. Hmm, wait, wait—1.0048 divided by 0.7201. Let me compute that more accurately.

1.0048 / 0.7201: Let's see, 0.7201 * 1.394 is around 1.004. So γ ≈ 1.394.

Now, to find T2: T2 = T1 * (P2 / P1)^( (γ-1)/γ )

Compute (γ-1)/γ: (1.394-1)/1.394 = 0.394 / 1.394 ≈ 0.2826.

So T2 = 388.15 K * (138 / 690)^(0.2826)

Wait, 138/690 is approximately 0.2. Let me compute 138/690: 138 ÷ 690. 690/138 ≈ 5, so 138/690 is 0.2 exactly. Oh wait, 138 *5 =690, yes. So 0.2.

So T2 = 388.15 K * (0.2)^0.2826.

What's (0.2)^0.2826? Let me compute that. Let's take the natural log: ln(0.2) = -1.6094. Multiply by 0.2826: -1.6094 * 0.2826 ≈ -0.4548. Then exponentiate: e^(-0.4548) ≈ 0.635.

So T2 ≈ 388.15 * 0.635 ≈ Let's compute: 388 *0.6 is 232.8, 388 *0.035 is about 13.58. So total ≈ 246.38 K.

Wait, but let me calculate more accurately: 0.635 * 388.15 = ?

0.6 * 388.15 = 232.89, 0.035 *388.15=13.585. So 232.89 +13.585=246.475 K. Approximately 246.48 K.

So the temperature drops from 388.15 K to about 246.48 K. So ΔT is 388.15 - 246.48 = 141.67 K.

Now, compute the mass m. Using the ideal gas law: m = (P1 V1) / (R T1)

But wait, P is in kPa, which is kN/m². V is in m³, since I need to convert ft³ to m³.

Wait, the initial volume is 0.1 ft³. I need to convert that to cubic meters. I remember that 1 ft is 0.3048 meters. So 1 ft³ is (0.3048)^3 m³. Compute that: 0.3048^3 ≈ 0.0283168 m³.

So 0.1 ft³ = 0.1 * 0.0283168 ≈ 0.00283168 m³.

So P1 is 690 kPa, which is 690,000 Pa, or 690,000 N/m².

R is 0.2847 kJ/kg·K, but wait, in gas law, R is in J/kg·K. Oh right, because P is in Pa (N/m²), V in m³, so R is in J/(kg·K).

Wait, 1 kJ is 1000 J, so R is 284.7 J/kg·K.

So m = (P V) / (R T) = (690,000 Pa * 0.00283168 m³) / (284.7 J/kg·K * 388.15 K)

Compute numerator: 690000 * 0.00283168 = 690,000 * 0.00283168.

Let's compute 690,000 * 0.002 = 1380, 690,000 *0.00083168= let's calculate 690000 * 0.0008 = 552, and 690000 * 0.00003168= approx 21.8.

So 1380 +552=1932, plus 21.8 is 1953.8. So numerator ≈ 1953.8 N·m (which is Joules).

Denominator: 284.7 * 388.15 ≈ Let's compute 284.7 * 400 = 113,880, but subtract 284.7*(400-388.15)=284.7*11.85. 284.7 *10=2847, 284.7*1.85≈527. So 2847+527≈3374. So 113880 -3374=110,506.

Wait, wait: 388.15 is (400 - 11.85). So 284.7 * 388.15 = 284.7*(400 - 11.85) = 284.7*400 - 284.7 *11.85.

Compute 284.7 *400 = 113,880. 284.7 *11.85:

Compute 284.7 *10 = 2847, 284.7 *1.85= let's see, 284.7 *1=284.7, 284.7 *0.85=242. So 284.7 +242=526.7. So 11.85 *284.7 = 2847 +526.7 =3373.7.

So denominator is 113880 -3373.7=110,506.3 J/kg.

So m = 1953.8 / 110,506.3 ≈ 0.01768 kg. Approximately 0.01768 kg.

Now, compute work done W = m c_v (T1 - T2) = 0.01768 kg * 0.7201 kJ/kg·K * (388.15 - 246.48) K.

First, compute (388.15 - 246.48) = 141.67 K.

So W = 0.01768 * 0.7201 * 141.67.

Calculate 0.01768 * 0.7201 first.

0.01768 * 0.7 = 0.012376, 0.01768 * 0.0201≈0.0003556. So total ≈0.012376 + 0.0003556≈0.0127316.

Then multiply by 141.67: 0.0127316 * 141.67 ≈ 1.798 kJ. Hmm, close to 1.8 kJ.

Looking at the options, option H is 1.8122 kJ, which is very close. So probably that's the correct answer.

Wait, but let me check the calculations again for any possible mistakes.

Wait, when I calculated m, I used R as 284.7 J/kg·K, but wait, c_p and c_v were given in kJ/kg·K, so R would be in kJ/kg·K as well. No, wait, the ideal gas law uses R in J/kg·K when P is in Pa and V in m³. Because 1 Pa = 1 N/m², and 1 J = 1 N·m. So yes, R is 284.7 J/kg·K.

So the mass calculation seems correct.

Wait, the initial volume: 0.1 ft³ is 0.00283168 m³, correct.

Then, P1 V1 = 690,000 Pa * 0.00283168 m³ = 690,000 *0.00283168. Let me compute that: 690000 * 0.00283168.

Wait, 690000 * 0.002 = 1380, 690000 *0.00083168=?

Wait, 0.0008 *690000 = 552, 0.00003168 *690000 = approx 21.85. So 552 +21.85=573.85. So total P1V1=1380 +573.85=1953.85 J.

Denominator R*T1 =284.7 J/kg·K * 388.15 K=284.7 *388.15.

Wait, 284.7 * 388 = let's compute: 284.7 * 400 = 113,880. Subtract 284.7 *12=3,416.4. So 113,880 - 3,416.4=110,463.6 J/kg.

So m=1953.85 / 110463.6 ≈ approx 0.01768 kg. Correct.

Then, W= m c_v ΔT. So 0.01768 kg * 0.7201 kJ/kg·K * (388.15-246.48)=0.01768 *0.7201 *141.67.

Compute 0.01768 *0.7201: 0.01768 *0.7 is 0.012376, 0.01768 *0.0201= approximately 0.0003556, so total ~0.0127316.

Multiply by 141.67: 0.0127316 *141.67 = let's compute 0.0127 *140=1.78, but more accurately:

0.0127316 *141.67 = let me compute 0.0127316 *140 = 1.78224, and 0.0127316 *1.67≈0.02123. So total ~1.80347 kJ. So approximately 1.803 kJ.

Looking at the options, option H is 1.8122 kJ, which is very close. So I think that's the correct answer. But wait, why is there a slight discrepancy? Maybe because of rounding during calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (T2/T1) more accurately. Let me recalculate T2.

Given γ=1.0048/0.7201=approx 1.394. Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 1.0048 / 0.7201.

Compute 0.7201 * 1.394: 0.7201 *1=0.7201, 0.7201*0.3=0.21603, 0.7201*0.09=0.064809, 0.7201*0.004=0.0028804. Sum up: 0.7201 +0.21603=0.93613 +0.064809=1.00094 +0.00288≈1.00382. So 0.7201 *1.394≈1.00382, which is just under 1.0048. Hmm, so perhaps γ is a bit higher than 1.394. Let me compute more accurately.

Compute 1.0048 / 0.7201.

Let me do it division:

0.7201 ) 1.0048

0.7201 *1 = 0.7201 → subtract, 1.0048 -0.7201=0.2847.

Bring down a zero (treat as 0.28470).

0.7201 * 0.394 ≈ 0.7201 *0.3=0.21603, 0.7201 *0.09=0.064809, 0.7201 *0.004=0.0028804. Sum is 0.21603+0.064809=0.280839 +0.0028804=0.2837194. Which is 0.2837194, which is very close to 0.2847. So 1.394 gives 1.00382, and we have 1.0048, so the actual γ is approximately 1.394 + (0.2847-0.2837194)/(0.7201) )? Wait, perhaps better to just accept that γ is approximately 1.394.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it more precisely.

Wait, 0.7201 * 1.394 = 1.00382 as before.

The difference between 1.0048 and 1.00382 is 0.00098. So 0.00098 / 0.7201 ≈ 0.00136. So γ is approximately 1.394 + 0.00136 ≈ 1.39536.

So γ ≈ 1.3954.

Then, (γ-1)/γ = (0.3954)/1.3954 ≈ 0.2835.

So, exponent is 0.2835.

So T2 = T1 * (P2/P1)^(0.2835) = 388.15 * (0.2)^0.2835.

Compute (0.2)^0.2835.

Take natural log: ln(0.2)= -1.60944.

Multiply by 0.2835: -1.60944 *0.2835 ≈-0.456.

Exponentiate: e^-0.456 ≈ 0.632.

So T2 = 388.15 *0.632 ≈ let's compute 388 *0.6=232.8, 388 *0.032=12.416. So 232.8 +12.416=245.216 K.

Wait, more accurately: 388.15 *0.632 = 388 *0.6 is 232.8, 388 *0.032 is 12.416, 0.15 *0.632 is 0.0948. So total 232.8+12.416=245.216 +0.0948=245.3108 K.

So T2≈245.31 K.

ΔT = 388.15 -245.31=142.84 K.

Now, recalculate work: W= m c_v (T1 - T2)=0.01768 kg *0.7201 kJ/kg·K *142.84 K.

Compute 0.01768 *0.7201= let's compute more accurately.

0.01768 *0.7 =0.012376.

0.01768 *0.0201=0.0003556.

So 0.012376 +0.0003556=0.0127316 kJ/(kg·K) ?

Wait, no: 0.01768 kg * 0.7201 kJ/kg·K = 0.0127316 kJ/K. Multiply by ΔT in K (142.84 K):

0.0127316 *142.84= ?

Compute 0.0127 *142.84= 1.808.

Wait, 0.01 *142.84=1.4284, 0.002 *142.84=0.28568, 0.0007 *142.84≈0.099988.

So 1.4284
