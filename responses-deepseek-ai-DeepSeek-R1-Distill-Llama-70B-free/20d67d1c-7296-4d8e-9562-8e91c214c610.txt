Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read it carefully.

The question is asking, "What term describes someone who does not believe in the existence of God?" The options are A through J, each with a different term. I'm a bit rusty on some of these, but I think I can work through it.

First, I'll go through each option one by one to try to remember what each term means.

Option A: Monotheist. Hmm, I remember that monotheism is the belief in one God. So a monotheist believes in a single deity. That's the opposite of what the question is asking, so A is not the right answer.

Option B: Humanist. Humanism, from what I know, is more about focusing on human values and ethics without necessarily religious beliefs. But I'm not sure if it directly relates to belief in God. I think humanists can be atheists or agnostics, but the term itself doesn't specifically mean not believing in God. So B might not be the answer.

Option C: Pantheist. Pantheism is the belief that God is everything and everything is God, so it's more like God is the universe. So a pantheist does believe in God, just in a different form. So C isn't the answer either.

Option D: Agnostic. Agnosticism is about not knowing whether God exists. An agnostic doesn't claim to know if there's a God or not; they're more about the uncertainty. So it's a different stance than not believing. So D isn't the answer.

Option E: Polytheist. Polytheism is the belief in multiple gods. So someone who believes in several deities, like in ancient mythologies. So E isn't the answer because they do believe in gods, just more than one.

Option F: Atheist. Atheism is the belief that there is no God. So an atheist actively doesn't believe in the existence of God. That seems to fit the question perfectly. But I'll go through the rest to make sure.

Option G: Nihilist. Nihilism is more about the belief that life lacks meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value. It's a philosophical stance about meaning, not specifically about God. So G isn't the answer.

Option H: Hedonist. Hedonism is about seeking pleasure and avoiding pain. It's an ethical stance, not related to belief in God. So H isn't it.

Option I: Theist. Theism is the belief in one or more deities, so a theist believes in God. That's the opposite of what we're looking for, so I is out.

Option J: Deist. Deism is the belief in a God who created the universe but doesn't intervene in it. Deists believe in a higher power, so J isn't the answer.

So after going through all the options, the only one that fits someone who doesn't believe in God is F: Atheist. I'm pretty confident about that because I remember that atheism is specifically about the lack of belief in deities.
