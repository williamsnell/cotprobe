Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about determining the dimensions of the activation map after the first convolutional layer in a CNN. Hmm, I remember that the output size of a convolutional layer depends on a few factors: the input size, the filter size, the stride, and the padding used.

So the input image here is 32x32 with 1 color channel. The first layer uses 4 filters, each of size 5x5. The stride is 2, and there's zero-padding of width 1. I need to find the size k of the resulting activation map for each filter.

Wait, how does the calculation work again? Oh right, the formula for the output size when using a convolutional layer is: 

output_size = (input_size - filter_size + 2*padding) / stride + 1

Or wait, sometimes it's (input_size - filter_size + 2*padding) divided by stride, then add 1? I think that's right. Let me make sure.

So applying this formula to each dimension (since the input is square, both width and height are the same). So input_size is 32, filter is 5x5, padding is 1 on each side, and stride is 2.

Plugging in the numbers: (32 -5 + 2*1) / 2 +1? Wait, no, wait. Let me get the order right. The formula is (input_size + 2*padding - filter_size) / stride, and then you take the floor, or sometimes it's done with ceiling, but I think in this context it's a straightforward division.

Wait another thought: some frameworks might handle it differently, but the standard formula for output size when using padding is:

output_size = (input_size - filter_size + 2*padding) / stride + 1? 

Wait no, wait. Let me think again. Oh no, I think I mixed it up. Correct formula is:

output_size = (input_size + 2*padding - filter_size) // stride

Wait, but sometimes it's (input_size - filter_size + 2*padding) // stride + 1. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should write it down.

Wait, suppose input is W, filter is F, padding is P, stride is S. The formula is:

output_size = ((W + 2P - F) / S) 

Wait, but that can't be right because sometimes you have to add 1. No, wait, no. Let me think about a simple example. Let's say input is 10x10, filter 3x3, padding 0, stride 1. Then output would be (10-3 +1) =8, right? So 8x8. So the formula there is (10-3)/1 +1 =8.

So the general formula is (W - F + 2P)/S +1. Oh wait, no, wait. Because when padding is added on both sides, you add 2P to the input size before subtracting F. So the formula should be (W + 2P - F) // S + 1.

Wait, but sometimes when the division isn't exact, some methods will use ceiling instead of floor. But in this case, I think the calculation would be exact.

Wait, let's plug in the numbers. W is 32. F is 5. P is 1. S is 2.

So (32 + 2*1 -5) = (32 +2 -5)= 29. Then divide by 2, which is 14.5. Then add 1? No, wait, no, because in the example I thought of earlier, when W=10, F=3, P=0, S=1: (10+0-3)=7, /1 is 7, +1 gives 8, which is correct. So the formula would be ((W + 2P - F) // S ) +1.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, because when you have stride S, it's (W + 2P - F) divided by S, then you add 1. Wait, no, in the example, (10+0 -3) is 7, divided by S=1 is 7, then add 1 gives 8. Which is correct.

But in this problem, let's compute:

(32 + 2*1 -5) = 32+2-5=29.

Then, 29 divided by 2 is 14.5.

Hmm, but you can't have half a pixel. So what happens here? Do we floor it or use integer division? I think in this case, it would be 14.5, but since we're dealing with whole numbers, perhaps it's 14 if using floor, but maybe the formula is adjusted.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is:

output_size = (W - F + 2P) / S + 1

Wait, no, that wouldn't make sense with the example I used earlier. Let's recheck.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

output_size = ((W + 2P - F) ) // S 

Wait, in that case, (32 + 2 -5) =29, 29//2 is 14 (since 2*14=28, 29-28=1). So output size is 14. So 14x14 activation map.

Wait, but wait another way: Let's think about the computation. The filter slides over the image. With a stride of 2, each step moves the filter by 2 pixels.

The input size is 32, padding is 1 on each side, so the effective size becomes 32 + 2*1=34. The filter is 5x5. So the number of positions the filter can slide over is (34 -5)/2 +1 ?

Wait, 34-5 is 29. 29 divided by 2 is 14.5. So the number of positions would be 15 if we're rounding up, but perhaps it's 14 if using integer division.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the way padding is applied. Let me think again.

When you apply padding of width 1, the image size becomes 32 + 2*1 =34. Then, the filter of size 5 is moved with a stride of 2.

So the number of steps is (34 -5)/2 +1.

Wait, that's (29)/2 +1 = 14.5 +1=15.5, which is not possible. Hmm, I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (input_size - filter_size) / stride +1, but including padding.

Wait, another approach. The general formula is:

output_size = (input_size + 2*padding - filter_size) / stride 

But if it's not an integer, the output is floored, but sometimes it's ceiled, depending on the convention.

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

output_size = (input_size - filter_size + 2*padding) / stride +1 

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me try with the example I used earlier.

In the example where input is 10, filter is 3, padding 0, stride 1.

So (10 -3 + 0) /1 +1 =7+1=8. Which is correct.

In the problem's case: (32 -5 + 2*1)/2 +1. So (32-5=27 +2=29)/2=14.5 +1=15.5. That's not possible. So perhaps that formula isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (input_size + 2*padding - filter_size) / stride, and then rounded down if necessary.

So 32 +2*1 =34. 34 -5 =29. 29 /2 is 14.5. So 14 if using floor, 15 if using ceiling.

But in practice, the output must be an integer. So perhaps the formula is (input_size + 2*padding - filter_size) // stride +1?

Wait, no, in the example, 10 +0 -3=7, 7//1=7, +1=8. Correct.

In the problem, 32+2 -5=29. 29//2=14. 14+1=15. So output size would be 15. But wait, let me check.

Wait, with a 32x32 image and padding 1, the image becomes 34x34. Then the filter is 5x5. How many positions are there when moving with stride 2?

The first position starts at 0,0. The next at 0,2. Then 0,4, etc., until you reach the end.

So the number of positions along one dimension is (34 -5)/2 +1.

34-5=29. 29/2=14.5, so 14 full steps and a half. So how many positions? 14 steps would give 15 positions (since starting at 0: 0,2,...28: which is 15 positions (from 0 to 14 steps, 15 positions)). Wait, no. Wait, 0 to 28 is 29 units, but with step 2, how many steps? Let me compute.

Number of steps: (end - start)/step +1. So (28-0)/2 +1=14 +1=15. So 15 positions.

Wait, but the formula without considering padding and such would give (32-5)/2 +1= (27)/2 +1=13.5 +1=14.5. But that's without padding.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as (input_size + 2*padding - filter_size) // stride +1.

So (32 + 2*1 -5)/2 +1= (34-5=29). 29/2=14.5, which is 14 when using integer division. Then 14 +1=15. So output size is 15. But wait, that would give 15x15. But looking at the options, D is 15.

Wait, but I thought earlier that without the +1, the calculation would give 14.5, which would be 14 when floored. So perhaps I'm getting confused between different formula versions.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

output_size = (input_size - 1) * stride + filter_size - (stride -1)

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe I should visualize it.

Let's say the input is 32x32, pad to 34x34. The filter is 5x5.

So the number of possible positions along each dimension is (34 -5) +1. Because the filter can start at 0,1,..., up to 34-5=29, so 30 positions? Wait, 34-5=29, plus 1 gives 30 positions, but with a stride of 2, you take every second position.

Wait, no, the number of positions when stride is 2 would be (30-1)/2 +1 = 15.

Wait, 30 positions when stride is 1. But with stride 2, it's (30) / 2 =15 positions. Because you're stepping by 2 each time.

So in this case, the output size is 15x15. So k is 15, which is option D.

Wait, but earlier I thought of (32 +2 -5)=29, 29//2=14, but with +1 it's 15.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but based on this reasoning, the activation map would be 15x15. So the answer would be D:15.

To determine the dimensions of the activation map after the first convolutional layer in the CNN, we use the formula for the output size of a convolutional layer:

\[
\text{output\_size} = \frac{\text{input\_size} + 2 \cdot \text{padding} - \text{filter\_size}}{\text{stride}} + 1
\]

### Given Parameters:
- **Input size**: \(32 \times 32\)
- **Filter size**: \(5 \times 5\)
- **Stride**: \(2\)
- **Padding**: \(1\) (on each side, so total padding is \(2 \cdot 1 = 2\))

### Calculation:
1. Substitute the values into the formula:
   \[
   \text{output\_size} = \frac{32 + 2 \cdot 1 - 5}{2} + 1
   \]
2. Simplify the numerator:
   \[
   32 + 2 - 5 = 29
   \]
3. Divide by the stride:
   \[
   \frac{29}{2} = 14.5
   \]
4. Add 1 to account for the starting position:
   \[
   14.5 + 1 = 15.5
   \]
5. Since the output size must be an integer, we round down to the nearest whole number:
   \[
   \text{output\_size} = 15
   \]

Thus, the dimensions of the resulting activation map for each filter in the first layer are \(15 \times 15\).

### Final Answer:
D: 15
