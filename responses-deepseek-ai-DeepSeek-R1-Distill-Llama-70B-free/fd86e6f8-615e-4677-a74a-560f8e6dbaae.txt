Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again. The question is about a sphere starting from rest at the top of a hill. The hill has a constant angle of inclination, and the sphere rolls without slipping down. The question is asking which force provides the torque that causes the sphere to rotate. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, right. I remember that torque is what causes rotational motion. Torque is like the rotational equivalent of force. So torque equals the force multiplied by the lever arm, which is the perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation to where the force is applied.

The sphere is rolling without slipping, which means there's a static frictional force acting on it. Wait, static friction? Because when something rolls without slipping, the point of contact is momentarily at rest relative to the surface, so it's static friction, not kinetic. Kinetic friction is when things are sliding past each other.

So what forces are acting on the sphere? Well, gravity is pulling it down, and the normal force is perpendicular to the surface. But the sphere is rolling, so it's not just sliding; it's rotating as it moves. So there must be a torque causing that rotation.

Gravity is acting downward through the center of mass of the sphere. The normal force is pushing up at the point of contact. The component of gravity along the incline would cause the sphere to accelerate downward, but for rotation, we need torque around the center of mass.

Wait, the torque is caused by the frictional force. Because the sphere is rolling without slipping, the frictional force provides the necessary torque for rotation. But wait, if the sphere is just starting to roll, what's causing it to rotate?

Let me think. When the sphere starts to roll, the component of gravity parallel to the incline tries to make it move downward. But because it's rolling without slipping, there's a static frictional force acting up the incline. Wait, no, static friction opposes the relative motion. So when the sphere starts to move, the point of contact would tend to move backward relative to the hill, so friction acts forward up the incline.

So the frictional force is providing a torque about the center of mass of the sphere. Since torque is the force times the lever arm, and the lever arm here is the radius of the sphere, the friction provides the torque that causes rotation.

Wait, but let me make sure. The gravitational force can't provide torque around the center of mass because it acts through the center. The normal force also acts at the point of contact, but since it's perpendicular to the surface, its lever arm for rotation about the center is along the radius, but it's directed perpendicular. Wait, no, the normal force is perpendicular to the incline, so the torque from the normal would be zero because the line of action passes through the center. Or wait, no, the normal force acts at the point of contact, so the lever arm is the radius, but the force is perpendicular, so the torque would be r cross N. Hmm, maybe I should think about the direction.

But wait, gravity's component along the incline is mg sin(theta), and the component perpendicular is mg cos(theta). The normal force balances the perpendicular component, so it's mg cos(theta). But the normal force's line of action is through the point of contact, so the torque due to the normal force about the center would be N times r, but since N is perpendicular to the radius (because the radius is along the incline, and N is perpendicular to the incline), the sine of 90 degrees is 1, so torque would be N*r. Wait, but wait, the torque from the normal force would cause rotation in which direction? Actually, no, because the normal force is directed perpendicular to the surface, so for a sphere on an incline, the normal force is at an angle relative to the vertical. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, think about the rotational motion. The torque must cause the sphere to spin. The only other force that can cause torque is static friction. Because the gravitational force passes through the center of mass, so its torque is zero. The normal force's torque would tend to cause rotation, but in the opposite direction. Wait, no, because the normal force is at the point of contact, and its direction is perpendicular to the surface. So the torque from the normal would be in the direction that would spin the sphere backward, but that doesn't make sense because the sphere is rolling forward.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The sphere's rotation is caused by the torque from static friction. Because as the sphere starts to move down the incline due to gravity, the point of contact tends to slip backward, so static friction acts forward up the incline. This forward force provides a torque about the center of mass, causing the sphere to rotate clockwise (if looking from the top), which is the correct direction for rolling down.

So the force providing the torque is static friction. Looking at the options, that's option B.

To determine which force provides the torque that causes the sphere to rotate as it rolls without slipping down the hill, we analyze the forces acting on the sphere. Torque is responsible for rotational motion and is given by the product of the force and the perpendicular distance (lever arm) from the axis of rotation.

The sphere is rolling without slipping, which means static friction, not kinetic friction, is at play. Static friction acts at the point of contact between the sphere and the hill, opposing the relative motion. As the sphere starts to move down the incline due to gravity, the point of contact tends to slip backward relative to the hill. To prevent this, static friction acts upward along the incline.

The gravitational force acts downward through the center of mass of the sphere and does not provide torque because its line of action passes through the center. The normal force, which is perpendicular to the incline, also does not contribute to torque because it acts at the point of contact and does not cause rotation about the center of mass. 

The static frictional force, however, acts at the point of contact and provides a torque about the center of mass. This torque causes the sphere to rotate in the direction required for rolling without slipping. Therefore, the force responsible for the torque is static friction.
