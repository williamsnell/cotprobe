Question:

A chef owned a summer cottage on the lake. In order to facilitate the access to the cottage, the chef entered into an agreement with a neighbor, an adjoining land owner, whereby the neighbor, in writing, granted the chef a right-of-way over a strip of land 30 feet in width and a quarter of a mile in length along the eastern margin of the neighbor's property. Without notifying the neighbor, the chef proceeded to improve the roadbed by having the road asphalted in order to make it more accessible for motor vehicle traffic. Several years later, the neighbor started a sand business, which required him to do heavy hauling that subsequently destroyed the asphalted surface on the road. Ten years after the neighbor started his sand business, the chef sold his lakefront property to his assistant. Shortly after the assistant took possession of the cottage and property, the neighbor erected wooden barriers across the roadway, thus obstructing the access to the assistant's property. The assistant's strongest argument in an action against the neighbor for removal of the barriers, which are obstructing his access to the property, would be that

Options:

A: the neighbor's sand business constitutes a misuse of the easement.
B: the chef's improvements to the roadbed grant him additional rights to the easement.
C: the chef and the assistant, being in privity of estate, could "tack on" their successive use periods.
D: an easement appurtenant is alienable in that any conveyance transferring possession of the dominant tenement also passes the easement privilege.
E: the assistant, as a bonafide purchaser, is protected from the neighbor's obstruction, even though the easement was unrecorded.
F: because the easement was created by implication, the chef's prior and continuous use gave rise to a prescriptive easement.
G: the assistant has a legal right to improve the easement for his own use.
H: the assistant is entitled to compensation for the damage caused by the neighbor's sand business.
I: the assistant can claim ownership of the easement due to his long-term use of the property.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about easements in property law. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the scenario: A chef owns a summer cottage and gets an easement from a neighbor. The easement is a right-of-way over a specific strip of land. It's written, so that's an express easement. The chef then improves the road by asphalt without telling the neighbor. Years later, the neighbor starts a sand business that damages the asphalt. Then, the chef sells the property to his assistant. After that, the neighbor blocks the road, and the assistant wants to sue to remove the barriers.

The question is about the assistant's strongest argument. So, I need to figure out which option correctly states the legal basis for the assistant's claim.

Let me look at each option one by one.

Option A: The neighbor's sand business misuses the easement. Hmm. So, the easement was for access, and the neighbor's use might have been more intensive. But wait, does the easement allow the neighbor to use it as well? Or is the easement only for the chef? Wait, easements can be appurtenant or in gross. This seems appurtenant because it benefits the chef's land. The neighbor is the owner of the servient estate. So, can the neighbor use the easement? Or does it depend on the terms? The original agreement granted the chef a right-of-way, so the neighbor can still use their land as long as they don't interfere with the easement. So if the neighbor's business is causing damage, maybe that's a misuse, but I'm not sure. Also, the easement is for access, so the neighbor's heavy hauling might be beyond the scope. But I'm not certain if that's the strongest argument.

Option B: Chef's improvements give additional rights. I don't think so. Generally, the holder of an easement can make improvements, but the scope of the easement isn't necessarily expanded by that. The improvements might be considered, but I don't think it grants new rights. So B might not be the right choice.

Option C: Privity of estate and tacking. Tacking is about the continuity of use to gain prescriptive rights, but here the easement is express, so tacking might not apply. Also, privity would matter for transferring the easement. Since the chef sold to the assistant, they are in privity, so the easement passes. But I'm not sure if "tacking" is the key here. Maybe not the strongest point.

Option D: Easement appurtenant is alienable. Yes, easements appurtenant transfer with the dominant estate. So when the chef sold the property, the easement would automatically go to the assistant. So D is a strong point because it's about the transfer of the easement.

Option E: Assistant is a bona fide purchaser protected despite unrecorded easement. Wait, the easement was written, so presumably recorded? Or maybe not. If it's unrecorded, a BFP might not be bound, but the question doesn't say whether it was recorded. So E might not be the best if the easement was recorded. But the question doesn't specify, so maybe E is a possibility if the easement wasn't recorded, but I think the fact that it was written might mean it was recorded, but I'm not certain. So maybe D is better.

Option F: Easement by implication, leading to prescriptive. No, because the easement was created by a written agreement, so it's express, not implied. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Assistant can improve the easement. While easement holders can make improvements, that's more about their rights, but the issue here is obstruction, not improvement. So G might not be the main argument.

Option H: Compensation for damage. The question is about removing barriers, not about compensation for damage. So H is about a different remedy, maybe, but not the primary issue here.

Option I: Ownership through long-term use. No, because the easement was already created; the assistant doesn't own it, just holds the easement as part of the property.

So, the strongest argument would be that the easement appurtenant is alienable, so when the chef sold, the assistant got it. So the neighbor can't block it because the easement is still valid and transferred.

So the correct answer is D.
</think>

The strongest argument for the assistant in this scenario is that an easement appurtenant is alienable, meaning that when the chef sold the property to the assistant, the easement automatically transferred to the assistant as part of the dominant estate. This is because easements appurtenant are tied to the land and pass with the property upon sale. The other options either misapply legal principles or address secondary issues, such as misuse or compensation, which are not the primary focus of the assistant's claim to remove the barriers obstructing access.

**Answer: D**
