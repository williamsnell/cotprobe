Okay, so I've got this problem here about an AC circuit with an inductor and a resistor in series. Hmm, I remember that in an AC circuit with both resistance and inductive reactance, I need to use the concept of impedance. Impedance is like the total opposition to the current.

Alright, the given values are: inductive reactance (XL) is 60 ohms, resistance (R) is 25 ohms, and the voltage (V) is 130 volts. I think the formula for impedance (Z) is the square root of (R squared plus XL squared). So Z equals sqrt(R² + XL²). Let me plug the numbers in.

First, square the resistance: 25 squared is 625. Then square the inductive reactance: 60 squared is 3600. Adding those together gives 625 + 3600 = 4225. Now take the square root of 4225. Wait, what's the square root of 4225? Oh right, 65, because 65 times 65 is 4225. So impedance Z is 65 ohms.

Now, to find the current (I), I use Ohm's law for AC circuits, which is I = V / Z. So that's 130 volts divided by 65 ohms. Let me calculate that: 130 divided by 65 equals 2. So the current should be 2 amps. 

Looking at the options, option F is 2.0 amp. So that should be the correct answer.

To determine the current through the circuit, we first calculate the impedance \( Z \) using the formula for a series AC circuit with resistance \( R \) and inductive reactance \( X_L \):  

\[
Z = \sqrt{R^2 + X_L^2}
\]

Substituting the given values (\( R = 25 \, \Omega \), \( X_L = 60 \, \Omega \)):  

\[
Z = \sqrt{25^2 + 60^2} = \sqrt{625 + 3600} = \sqrt{4225} = 65 \, \Omega
\]

Next, we use Ohm's law for AC circuits to find the current \( I \):  

\[
I = \frac{V}{Z}
\]

Substituting (\( V = 130 \, \text{V} \), \( Z = 65 \, \Omega \)):  

\[
I = \frac{130}{65} = 2.0 \, \text{A}
\]

Thus, the current through the circuit is **2.0 A**, corresponding to option **F**.
