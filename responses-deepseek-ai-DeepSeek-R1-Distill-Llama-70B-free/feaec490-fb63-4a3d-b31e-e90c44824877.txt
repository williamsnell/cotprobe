Okay, so I've got this question about phases of the Earth as seen from Venus. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to break it down.

I remember that when we talk about phases of a planet or the Moon, it's about how much of the illuminated side we can see from a certain point. The Earth, when viewed from Venus, would go through different phases just like the Moon does from Earth.

So, first, I need to think about the relative positions of Earth, Venus, and the Sun. Venus is closer to the Sun than Earth, right? So when we're on Venus, looking at Earth, Earth would appear to go through phases similar to how the Moon appears from Earth.

Wait, but how exactly does that work? Let me visualize this. The Moon goes through phases because as it orbits the Earth, different amounts of its illuminated side face our planet. So from Venus, Earth would do the same as it orbits the Sun.

When the Earth is between the Sun and Venus, that would be like a "new Earth" phase, where the side facing Venus is not illuminated. But wait, no, because the Sun would be on the opposite side from Earth's perspective. So when Venus is between the Sun and Earth, the Earth would appear full, right? Because the entire face of Earth facing Venus would be lit up by the Sun.

But wait, that's probably when Venus is at a certain point in its orbit. Let me think: Venus's orbit is inside Earth's, so the maximum angle between Earth and the Sun as seen from Venus would be when Earth is at its farthest point in its orbit from the Sun relative to Venus.

Wait, no. The maximum angle (greatest elongation) would determine how much of Earth's illuminated side we can see. So when Earth is at its greatest elongation east or west of the Sun as seen from Venus, that's when you can see the half-illuminated phase, like the first or third quarter.

So the phases would go like this: When Earth is in the direction of the Sun from Venus, it's new Earth. Then, as Earth moves away from that position, you see a small crescent, which would be the waxing crescent phase. Wait, no, because as Earth moves away from the Sun in the sky from Venus's perspective, the amount of illuminated surface would increase.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me correct this. For the Moon, when it's new, it's between the Sun and Earth, so we don't see it. As it moves away, we see a sliver of light, which is the crescent. From Venus, when Earth is in the direction of the Sun, it's new, so we would see the dark side, which is not illuminated, so it would be like a new moon phase.

But wait, the Earth would be in the same direction as the Sun from Venus when it's at superior conjunction. At that point, the Earth would appear as a new phase, not visible because the Sun's glare would obscure it. Then, as Earth moves away from that position, it would start showing a crescent. So the sequence would be: New, then Waxing Crescent, then First Quarter, then Waxing Gibbous, then Full, then Waning Gibbous, Last Quarter, and Waning Crescent.

Wait, but wait, from Venus, does Earth ever appear full? Because for Earth to be full, the Sun must be shining on the entire Earth-facing side. That would happen when Venus is between the Earth and the Sun, but wait no, that's when Earth is at opposition from the Sun. Wait, no: when Venus is between Earth and the Sun, that's when Earth would be at its farthest point from the Sun as seen from Venus. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps it's when Earth is at opposition relative to Venus. Let me think: when a planet is at opposition, it's on the opposite side of the Sun from the observer's point. So for Earth to be at opposition from Venus, the Sun would be between Venus and Earth. Wait, but that would mean that Earth is in the night sky of Venus, and fully illuminated. So that would be the full Earth phase.

Wait, no, because if the Sun is between Venus and Earth, then the Earth would be in the opposite direction from the Sun, making it full. So when Earth is at opposition, it's full.

So the phases would go through from New (when Earth is between Venus and Sun), then as Earth moves away, it becomes a waxing crescent, then first quarter, then gibbous, then full when it's opposite the Sun. Then it would start to wane: waning gibbous, last quarter, then waning crescent, and back to new.

But wait, the question is asking which phases you would see. So looking at the options, let's see.

Option A: Waning crescent, New, Waxing crescent. That's the sequence from new to first quarter, but that's only part of the phases.

Option B: New, Waxing crescent, First quarter. That's the beginning.

Option C: Full, Waning crescent, New. Hmm, that seems like a partial set.

Option D: Full moon only. That's if you can only see it when it's full, but that's not the case because Earth would go through all phases.

Option E: First quarter, Waxing gibbous, Full. That's a sequence leading up to full.

Option F: New only. No, we can see other phases.

Option G: Waning gibbous, New, Waxing gibbous. Hmm, that skips some steps.

Option H: Waxing gibbous, Full, Waning gibbous. That's the full phase and the surrounding gibbous phases.

Option I: Third quarter, Waning crescent, New.

Option J: New, first quarter, full, third quarter. That's the four main phases.

Wait, but the question is about what phases you would see from Venus. So Earth would go through all the phases similar to the Moon, right? So from Venus, you'd see Earth go from New to Full and back to New again, showing all the phases in between.

But looking at the options, let me think. The question is phrased as "what phases of the Earth would you see?" So perhaps the answer includes all possible phases, but the options don't all include all of them.

Wait, the options don't have an option that includes all phases. So perhaps the question is referring to the visible phases, considering that at certain times, Earth might be too close to the Sun to be seen, so you can't see all phases.

Wait, when Earth is in the direction of the Sun from Venus, you can't see it because it's in the daytime sky. So Earth would only be visible when it's away from the Sun, i.e., in the night sky of Venus. So that would correspond to when Earth is at opposition, which is the full phase. But wait, that's not correct because Earth would be visible for a period around opposition, showing different phases as it moves through the sky.

Wait, but Venus's rotation is very slow, and it's extremely cloudy, but the question says to assume the telescope can see through the clouds. So the visibility isn't an issue beyond the Sun's glare.

So Earth would appear to go through phases, but when it's near the Sun in the sky, it's hard to see, but when it's far from the Sun, you can see it. So the visible phases would be when Earth is in the night sky of Venus, which would be when it's not too close to the Sun. So that would allow viewing of the gibbous phases, full, and maybe the quarter phases.

Wait, but let me think again. When Earth is at a point in its orbit where it's opposite the Sun from Venus (opposition), it's full. As it moves away from that point, you'd see a waning gibbous phase, then third quarter (which is like a last quarter), then waning crescent, and then it would disappear as it approaches the Sun again.

Wait, but that's only part of the cycle. Alternatively, maybe you can only see Earth when it's on the opposite side of the Sun, so you can see the full phase, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, no, because when Earth is at opposition, it's full. Then, as it moves eastward relative to Venus, you'd see it in the evening sky, going through gibbous, quarter, and crescent phases. Similarly, before opposition, it would be in the morning sky, showing gibbous, quarter, and crescent phases as well.

So from Venus, you'd see Earth go through all the phases, but the exact sequence depends on the orbital positions. Wait, but perhaps the only time it's visible is when it's in the night sky, so when it's not too close to the Sun. So the phases you can see would be from maybe waxing crescent to waning crescent, but not the new phase.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the Moon phases as an analogy. From Earth, the Moon goes through all phases, but when it's new, it's not visible because it's lost in the Sun's glare. Similarly, from Venus, the Earth would be visible when it's not too close to the Sun, so you can see it in the evening or morning sky, showing the gibbous, quarter, and crescent phases, but not the full phase when it's at opposition? Or wait, no, when it's at opposition, it's full, and that's when it's most visible because it's highest in the sky.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is arising because I'm mixing up the positions. Let me try to outline the possible phases:

1. When Earth is at superior conjunction (between Venus and Sun), it's a new Earth phase. But it's not visible because it's too close to the Sun.

2. As Earth moves away from this position towards the east, you'd start seeing a thin crescent in the western sky after sunset—waxing crescent.

3. Then, as it moves further, it becomes first quarter, then waxing gibbous, then full when at opposition.

4. After opposition, it becomes waning gibbous, then third quarter, then waning crescent in the eastern sky before sunrise.

5. Eventually, it approaches the Sun again and disappears.

So the phases you can see from Venus would include: waxing crescent, first quarter, waxing gibbous, full, waning gibbous, third quarter, waning crescent.

But wait, when Earth is at opposition, it's full, so that's a visible phase. Then, as it moves away, it becomes gibbous, then quarter, then crescent. Similarly, before opposition, you can see the same.

So the available phases are all except the new phase. Wait, but no, because when Earth is in the new phase, it's not visible, so the phases you can see are the others.

But looking at the options, which ones include multiple phases?

Looking at the options:

Option G: Waning gibbous, New, Waxing gibbous. Hmm, this includes the new phase, which we can't see, so probably not.

Option H: Waxing gibbous, Full, Waning gibbous. This includes the full and the gibbous phases on either side.

Option E: First quarter, Waxing gibbous, Full.

Option I: Third quarter, Waning crescent, New.

Option J: New, first quarter, full, third quarter. But since new isn't visible, this might not be correct.

Wait, but the question is, what phases would you see? So perhaps you can see all except new. But looking at the options, none of them include all except new. The closest is option G, but that includes new, which you can't see.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option G: Waning gibbous, New, Waxing gibbous. But that doesn't make sense because you can't see the new phase.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option H: Waxing gibbous, Full, Waning gibbous. Because when Earth is near opposition, you see it as full, and as it moves towards the east or west, it becomes gibbous. So perhaps the visible phases are the gibbous and full phases.

Wait, but that can't be right because when Earth is at first quarter or third quarter, it would also be visible. So perhaps the full range of phases is visible except new.

But looking at the options, perhaps option G is incorrect, and the correct answer is option H.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think differently.

Imagine you're on Venus and looking at Earth. The Earth would go through phases similar to the Moon, but because Venus is closer to the Sun, the maximum apparent size of Earth is larger, and the phases would appear accordingly.

When Venus and Earth are in a line with the Sun in the middle, that's superior conjunction for Earth, and Earth would be in the new phase. But you can't see it because it's too close to the Sun.

As Earth moves away from that point, you start seeing a small sliver, which is the crescent phase. Then it becomes first quarter, then gibbous, then full when it's opposite the Sun. Then it goes back through gibbous, third quarter, and crescent again before disappearing as it approaches the Sun again.

So the phases you can observe from Venus are: crescent (waxing and waning), first quarter, third quarter, gibbous (waxing and waning), and full.

Looking at the options, which one includes these?

Looking again:

Option G: Waning gibbous, New, Waxing gibbous. But New isn't visible.

Option H: Waxing gibbous, Full, Waning gibbous. So this includes the gibbous phases and full. But what about the crescent and quarter phases?

Option J: New, first quarter, full, third quarter. But New isn't visible.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option G, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option H.

Wait, another approach: when Earth is at a position where you can see it, it's in the night sky. So the phase would be full when opposite the Sun, and as it moves east or west, it becomes gibbous. So you would see the gibbous phases, full, and perhaps the quarter phases as well.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option H: Waxing gibbous, Full, Waning gibbous.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer includes all phases except new, but looking at the options, none of them include all except new.

Wait, the options don't have an option that includes all possible phases except new. So perhaps the correct answer is option H.

Another thought: when Earth is at its maximum elongation from the Sun as seen from Venus, it would appear as a half-Earth, which is the first or third quarter phase. So you can see those phases, as well as the gibbous and full phases.

So perhaps the answer includes first quarter, gibbous, full, etc.

Looking again, option E is First quarter, Waxing gibbous, Full. That's a possible sequence. But the question is about what phases you would see, not the sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option G, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The Earth, as viewed from Venus, would display phases opposite to those the Moon shows from Earth when Earth is at a certain phase.

Wait, no, that's not accurate. The phases depend on the relative positions. Let me think of when you can see Earth from Venus. It would be visible when it's not too close to the Sun in the sky. So when it's in the evening or morning sky, you can see it. The full phase occurs when Earth is opposite the Sun, so it's highest in the sky at midnight on Venus.

So the phases you can see would include the gibbous phases (both waxing and waning), the full phase, and the quarter phases. So the answer might include multiple phases.

Looking at the options, option G is Waning gibbous, New, Waxing gibbous. But New isn't visible, so that's not correct.

Option H is Waxing gibbous, Full, Waning gibbous. That includes the full and the gibbous phases on either side, which are visible.

Option E is First quarter, Waxing gibbous, Full. That includes the quarter and gibbous leading up to full.

Wait, but the question is which phases you can see. So perhaps you can see all except new. But looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is option H, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option G. Because when Earth is moving towards opposition, you see the waxing gibbous, then full, then waning gibbous. So the phases you see are the gibbous phases and full.

Wait, that makes sense. So the answer would be option H: Waxing gibbous, Full, Waning gibbous.

But I'm not entirely certain. Another possibility is that you can see all phases except new, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option H.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option G, but I think option H makes more sense.

To determine the phases of Earth visible from Venus, we must consider the relative positions of Venus, Earth, and the Sun. Venus orbits closer to the Sun than Earth, so Earth's phases as seen from Venus would be similar to the Moon's phases as seen from Earth. However, the visibility of certain phases depends on Earth's position relative to the Sun in the sky from Venus.

1. **New Phase**: When Earth is directly between the Sun and Venus (at superior conjunction), it is in the new phase. However, this phase is not visible because Earth is too close to the Sun's glare.

2. **Crescent Phases**: As Earth moves away from the Sun's direction, a small sliver of light becomes visible, appearing as a waxing crescent in the evening sky. Similarly, on the opposite side of its orbit, Earth would appear as a waning crescent in the morning sky.

3. **Quarter Phases**: As Earth continues its orbit, it reaches first quarter (visible in the evening sky) and third quarter (visible in the morning sky).

4. **Gibbous Phases**: Between the quarter phases and full phase, Earth appears as a waxing gibbous (evening sky) or waning gibbous (morning sky).

5. **Full Phase**: When Earth is at opposition (on the opposite side of the Sun from Venus), it appears fully illuminated, making it the most visible phase.

6. **Visibility Constraints**: Earth is only visible from Venus when it is not too close to the Sun in the sky. Therefore, the new phase is never visible, while the other phases (waxing crescent, first quarter, waxing gibbous, full, waning gib
