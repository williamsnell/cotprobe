Okay, so I've got this problem about resolving sodium D lines using a grating and a prism. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my optics, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

Part (a) is about a grating. I remember that the resolving power of a grating is given by R = m*N, where m is the order of the spectrum and N is the number of lines. To resolve two lines, the resolving power must be enough to separate them. The condition is that the difference in wavelengths times the resolving power should be at least 1. So, Δλ * R ≥ 1.

Wait, the wavelengths given are 589.593 mμ and 588.996 mμ. So the difference Δλ is 589.593 - 588.996 = 0.597 mμ? Wait, or is it 0.597 mμ? Wait, no, wait a second, mμ is micrometers, which are 1e-6 meters, but in terms of units, 1 mμ is 0.001 microns, right? Or wait, no, mμ stands for milli-micron, which is 1e-9 meters, same as nanometers. Oh wait, wait, no. I think 1 mμ is 1e-3 microns, which is 1e-6 meters, same as micrometers. So the difference is 0.597 mμ. But wait, the formula uses Δλ in the same units as the wavelength. So I think I should compute the resolving power needed.

For the grating, the minimum number of lines N is such that R ≥ 1/Δλ. But wait, no, the formula I remember is that the resolving power R is m*N, and the condition is R ≥ λ/Δλ. Wait, that's another approach. Let me get this straight.

Actually, the Rayleigh criterion for resolving two lines is that the difference in their wavelengths must satisfy Δλ = λ/(m*N), but I think I might have it backward. So the resolving power R is m*N, and R should be at least λ/Δλ. So R = m*N ≥ λ/Δλ.

Wait, let me confirm. The resolving power R is defined as the ability to distinguish two wavelengths, and R = λ/Δλ. But for a grating, R is also equal to m*N, where m is the order and N is the number of lines. So we have m*N ≥ λ/Δλ.

Wait, but wait. Let's compute this correctly. The two lines are at 589.593 and 588.996 mμ, so their average λ is roughly (589.593 + 588.996)/2 ≈ 589.2945 mμ. Let me compute Δλ as 589.593 - 588.996 = 0.597 mμ.

So R = λ/Δλ ≈ 589.2945 / 0.597 ≈ let's calculate that. 589.2945 / 0.597 is approximately 589.2945 / 0.6 ≈ 984.99, so about 985. So R must be at least 985. Since R is m*N, and here we're considering first order (m=1), so N must be at least 985. But wait, the options have 985 as option E, 986 as B, etc. But wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 589.593 minus 588.996 is 0.597 mμ. So λ is approximately 589.2945 mμ. So R = 589.2945 / 0.597 = let me compute this exactly. 589.2945 divided by 0.597. Let me do the division:

0.597 * 985 is 0.597 * 900 = 537.3, 0.597*85=50.745; total 537.3+50.745=588.045. So 0.597 * 985 = 588.045. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait, wait, R is λ/Δλ. So 589.2945 / 0.597 = let me compute that. Let me compute 589.2945 / 0.597.

Approximating, 589.2945 ÷ 0.6 is approximately 982.99, so about 983. But since 0.597 is smaller than 0.6, the actual value will be a bit higher. Let me compute 0.597 * 985 = 0.597 * (900 + 85) = 0.597*900=537.3, 0.597*85=50.745, so total 537.3+50.745=588.045.

But 588.045 is less than 589.2945, so 0.597 * 985 = 588.045, which is less than 589.2945. So 589.2945 - 588.045 = 1.2495. So 1.2495 / 0.597 ≈ 2.09. So 0.597 * (985 + 2.09) = 588.045 + (0.597 * 2.09) ≈ 588.045 + 1.247 ≈ 589.292, which is close to 589.2945. So R is approximately 985 + 2.09 = 987.09. So R needs to be at least 987.09, so since R = m*N and m=1, N must be at least 988? Wait, but R must be >= lambda/dlambda, so N must be >= (lambda/dlambda)/m. So for m=1, N >= 987.09, so N must be at least 988 lines.

Wait, but wait, the options have N as 987, 986, etc. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exact value. Let me compute 589.2945 divided by 0.597.

Compute 589.2945 / 0.597:

Let me compute 589.2945 ÷ 0.597.

Multiply numerator and denominator by 1000: 589294.5 ÷ 597.

Compute 597 * 987 = 597*(900 + 80 +7) = 597*900=538,200; 597*80=47,760; 597*7=4,179. Sum: 538200 + 47760 = 585,960 + 4,179 = 590,139.

Wait, 597 * 987 = 590,139. But our numerator is 589,294.5.

So 597*987 = 590,139, which is larger than 589,294.5. The difference is 590,139 - 589,294.5 = 844.5.

So 589,294.5 = 597*(987) - 844.5. So 589,294.5 = 597*(987 - x), where x = 844.5 /597 ≈ 1.413. So 987 - 1.413≈985.587. So 589,294.5 ≈ 597 * 985.587. So R ≈ 985.587. So R must be >= 985.587. Since N must be an integer, N must be at least 986 lines. Because 985.587 is less than 986, so N=986 would make R=986, which is greater than 985.587.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. So the minimum N is 986 lines. Looking at the options, for part (a), option B has 986 lines, option I has 988, etc. Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because m=1, R=m*N= N. So R must be >= 985.587, so N must be at least 986. So the answer for part (a) is 986 lines. That would point to option B or I. Wait, looking at the options:

Looking at the options, part (a) in each option is:

A:987
B:986
C:990
D:989
E:985
F:999
G:984
H:982
I:988
J:1000

So if N is 986, that's option B. But wait, wait, because sometimes this calculation can be approximated. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the exact R needed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute R using more precise numbers. Let me compute Δλ more accurately.

Δλ is 589.593 mμ minus 588.996 mμ. That's 0.597 mμ. So exact Δλ is 0.597 mμ.

The average wavelength λ is (589.593 + 588.996)/2 = (1178.589)/2 = 589.2945 mμ.

So R = λ/Δλ = 589.2945 / 0.597 = let me compute that more accurately.

589.2945 ÷ 0.597.

Let me compute 589.2945 ÷ 0.597:

First, 0.597 × 985 = ?

0.597 × 900 = 537.3
0.597 × 80 = 47.76
0.597 × 5 = 2.985
So 900+80+5=985. So 537.3 +47.76 = 585.06 +2.985=588.045. So 0.597 ×985=588.045.

But our λ is 589.2945, which is larger than 588.045. So 589.2945 -588.045 =1.2495.

Now, 1.2495 ÷ 0.597 ≈ 2.09.

So 0.597 × 987 = 588.045 +0.597=588.642?

Wait no, 0.597 ×987= 0.597*(985+2) = 588.045 + (0.597*2)=588.045 +1.194=589.239.

Which is very close to 589.2945. So 0.597×987=589.239, which is less than 589.2945. The difference is 589.2945 -589.239=0.0555.

So 0.0555 ÷0.597≈0.093.

So R=987.093. So R must be >=987.093, but since R is an integer (as it's m*N, with m=1, N integer), N must be at least 988? Wait, no, because R can be a fractional number, but N must be an integer. So if R needs to be >= approximately 987.09, then N must be 988, because 987 is less than 987.09.

Wait, but wait, R is m*N, which would be N in this case (m=1). So if R needs to be 987.09, then N must be 988, because 987 is less than 987.09. So perhaps I was wrong earlier.

So that would mean the minimum N is 988, which would make R=988. But looking at the options, option I is 988 lines, and option D is 989. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps my approach is wrong. Another way to think: the Rayleigh formula for resolution is:

d sinθ = m λ, where d is the distance between adjacent lines.

But the resolving condition is that the difference in the sine of the angles for the two wavelengths should be at least λ/(N d), but I might be mixing things up.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I should use is the condition for resolution: the separation in the spectrum should be at least the width of the spectral line. The width is determined by the resolving power.

Wait, perhaps another approach is using the formula for the angular resolution. The minimum angle between two resolvable lines is given by δθ ≈ λ/(N d), where N is the number of lines and d is the grating spacing.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to approach from another angle. The resolving power R is defined as R = m*N. The formula for the minimum resolving power to distinguish two wavelengths is R ≥ λ/Δλ.

So in our case, λ is the average wavelength, which is approximately 589.2945 mμ, and Δλ is 0.597 mμ.

So R = 589.2945 / 0.597 ≈ 987.09. So R must be at least 987.09, which means N must be at least 988, since m=1, so N=988. But wait, the options don't have 988 except option I, which is 988 lines for part (a). So for part (a), the answer would be 988 lines, which is option I. But wait, earlier calculation suggested N=986. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, I think the confusion arises because in the formula R = m*N, R is the resolving power, and it must be greater than or equal to λ/Δλ. So if R comes to 987.09, then N must be at least 988 because N must be an integer. But wait, no, because 987.09 is just over 987, so N can be 988, but perhaps in the options, 987 is rounded up. Wait, let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option I has 988 lines, and option D has 989. But wait, in the calculation, R must be ≥ 987.09, so N must be 988, right? So part (a)'s answer would be 988 lines, which is option I. But looking at the options, option I is 988 lines and 1.88 cm for part (b). Hmm.

Wait, but let me proceed to part (b) and see if I can solve it, then I can see which option matches.

Part (b): How large a prism is needed to resolve these lines, given the rate of change of index with wavelength, d n/dλ at 589 mμ is 5.30e-5 per millimicron. Wait, prism resolving power.

I remember that the resolving power of a prism is given by R = (d n / dλ) * L * (m+1), where L is the length of the prism along the path of the light. Wait, no, perhaps the formula is R = (d n / dλ) * L. Or perhaps R is given by (d n / dλ) * L, and to resolve the lines, R must be ≥ 1/Δλ.

Wait, no, let me think again. The resolving power R of a prism is given by R = (λ / Δλ) = (d n / dλ) * L. Wait, perhaps that's the formula. So λ/Δλ = (d n/dλ) * L. Therefore, L = (λ/Δλ) / (d n/dλ).

Wait, that sounds right. So let's plug in the numbers.

λ is 589 mμ, which is 589e-9 meters, but perhaps in terms of millimicrons, since the derivative is given in permillimicron. Wait, d n/dλ is given as 5.30 × 10^-5 per millimicron. So, the unit is (change in index per millimicron).

So, λ is 589 mμ, which is 589 millimicrons. Δλ is 0.597 mμ, which is 0.597 millimicrons.

So R = λ/Δλ = 589 / 0.597 ≈ 987.09.

But according to the formula, R = (d n/dλ) * L. So L = R / (d n/dλ) = (987.09) / (5.30e-5 per millimicron).

Wait, but wait, the units need to make sense. Let me clarify.

Wait, the derivative d n/dλ is given in units of per millimicron. So, 5.30e-5 per millimicron. So d n/dλ = 5.30e-5 (millimicron)^-1.

Wait, but when we compute R = (d n/dλ) * L, the units would be (1/millimicron) * (centimeters? meters?), so I need to make sure the units are consistent.

Alternatively, perhaps better to compute L as R divided by (d n/dλ), with R being λ/Δλ.

Wait, L = R / (d n/dλ) = (589 / 0.597) / (5.30e-5 per mμ).

Wait, 589 is in mμ, 0.597 is in mμ, so 589/0.597 is in (mμ)/(mμ) = dimensionless. But that can't be, because L would have units of length. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, I think the correct formula is R = (d n/dλ) * L * (m + 1), where m is the order. But for prisms, the order isn't typically used, so maybe it's just R = (d n/dλ) * L.

Wait, perhaps I should refer to the formula for the resolving power of a prism. The formula I found online before is that the resolving power R = (d n/dλ) * L * (m + 1), but sometimes m is taken as 1 for the first order, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, some sources say R = (d n/dλ) * L.

Wait, let me get this straight. The resolving power R is the ability to distinguish two wavelengths, which is given by R = λ/Δλ. For a prism, R is also given by R = (d n/dλ) * L, where L is the length of the prism. So, equating the two: λ/Δλ = (d n/dλ) * L.

So rearranged, L = (λ/Δλ) / (d n/dλ).

Wait, that makes sense dimensionally because d n/dλ has units of 1/length, so when you divide by it, you get length.

So let's compute L.

λ is 589 mμ, which is 589e-6 meters, but wait, in terms of millimicrons, it's 589 millimicrons. Wait, no, because 1 mμ is 1e-3 microns, which is 1e-6 meters. Wait, but the derivative d n/dλ is given per millimicron, which is 1e-3 microns, which is 1e-6 meters. Wait, perhaps it's better to convert everything to consistent units.

Wait, λ is 589 mμ, which is 589e-3 microns. Wait,
