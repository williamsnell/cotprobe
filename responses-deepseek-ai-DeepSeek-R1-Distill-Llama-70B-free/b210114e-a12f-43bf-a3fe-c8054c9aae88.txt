Okay, so I've got this question about Kohlberg's theory of moral development. Hmm, I remember that Kohlberg proposed that people go through different stages of moral reasoning, right? There are three main levels: pre-conventional, conventional, and post-conventional.

The question is asking which explanation best fits the conventional level. Conventional morality, if I recall correctly, is about following social norms, rules, and expectations. People at this level do the right thing to gain approval from others or to maintain social order. It's not just about avoiding punishment, but more about living up to societal standards.

The scenario is a 17-year-old driving at or below the speed limit. I need to pick the option that aligns with conventional reasoning. Let's look at the options one by one.

Option A: "I don't want to waste gas." This seems more about practicality or personal conservation, not about social norms. So maybe pre-conventional?

Option B: "I'm not in a rush." That's just a personal choice, not related to morality or social rules.

Option C: "I want to impress my friends." Oh, this is about seeking approval from peers. That fits because conventional level is about meeting others' expectations, so this could be a contender.

Option D: "I find it relaxing to drive slowly." Again, personal preference, not moral reasoning.

Option E: "It's the law." This sounds like it's about obeying rules, but I'm not sure. Pre-conventional is about avoiding punishment, so maybe this is more about external rules. Wait, conventional is also about rules but with a more social understanding, like respecting laws because they're set for everyone's good. So E might fit.

Option F: "I want my parents to approve of my driving." This is seeking approval from authority figures. That's definitely conventional because it's about gaining approval from others, which is part of the conventional stage.

Option G: "I don't want to get any tickets." This is about avoiding punishment, which is more pre-conventional. So G is probably not the right choice.

Option H: "I don't want to crash my car." That's a safety concern, more about self-preservation than moral reasoning.

Option I: "I'm afraid of going fast." Again, personal fear, not about social norms.

Option J: "I want to be a good example for my younger siblings." This is about setting a good example, which is about social responsibility and meeting expectations, so this fits the conventional level too.

So now I have to decide between options C, E, F, and J.

Wait, let me think again. Conventional level includes two stages: stage 3 is about gaining approval of others, and stage 4 is about upholding the social order.

Option E: "It's the law." That might be more about stage 4, which is part of the conventional level. Because it's about respecting the law as a social norm.

Option F: Wanting parents' approval is more stage 3, which is also conventional. So both E and F are in conventional.

Option J: Being a good example is also stage 3, seeking approval and setting a good image.

So the question is which of these options best illustrates the conventional level.

But wait, the question is about why the 17-year-old drives at or below the speed limit. So the reasoning has to be tied to a moral perspective based on societal norms.

Option E is about obeying the law because it's the law. That's more of a stage 4 reasoning, which is conventional. Because it's not just about others' approval but about the system.

Option F is about parents' approval, which is stage 3, also conventional.

So the answer could be either E or F, but which is more indicative of the conventional level as a whole.

Wait, the conventional level is stage 2 and 3 and 4? No, no, Kohlberg's stages are:

Stage 1: Obedience and punishment orientation (pre-conventional)
Stage 2: Individualism and exchange (pre-conventional)
Stage 3: Good interpersonally oriented (conventional)
Stage 4: Law and order orientation (conventional)
Stage 5: Social contract (post-conventional)
Stage 6: Universal ethical principles (post-conventional)

Wait, so the conventional level includes stages 3 and 4. So both E and F are in conventional level.

But the question asks for which explanation best illustrates the conventional level. So perhaps the best example is one that's about social norms, either stage 3 or 4.

Looking back at the options, option E is about the law, which is stage 4, and option F is about parents' approval, which is stage 3. Both are conventional.

But the question is about the conventional level as a whole. So which option fits better?

Wait, another approach: conventional level is about understanding that rules are set for the good of society. So option E, "It's the law," might be a bit superficial. Because someone in stage 4 would think about the law as necessary for social order, not just because it's the law.

But perhaps the more direct conventional reasoning is about social expectations, like wanting approval. So option F is about parents, which is a social expectation.

Alternatively, option J is about being a good example, which is also social expectation.

Wait, but the question provides the answer choices, and the correct answer is one of them. I need to pick the best fit.

I think option E is more about law and order, which is stage 4, conventional. So it's a correct example of conventional.

Option F is about approval from parents, which is stage 3, also conventional.

So both E and F are correct, but which is the best example?

Wait, the question is about driving at or below the speed limit. Why? If it's because it's the law, that's a direct reference to societal rules (stage 4). If it's to gain parents' approval, that's more about personal relationships (stage 3).

But the question is about the conventional level, which includes both stages. So either could be correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the examples given in Kohlberg's stages. For instance, stage 3 often involves things like wanting to be a good boy or girl, or gaining approval from others. So option F and J fit that.

Stage 4 is more about understanding the importance of laws for society, so option E.

So the best illustration of the conventional level, perhaps the answer is E or F.

But looking back, the correct answer is probably E, because it's about following the law as a social norm, which is a key part of the conventional level.

Wait, but another thought: the conventional level is about social expectations and norms, not just the law. So in this case, driving within the speed limit because it's the law is a conventional reason.

Alternatively, someone at the post-conventional level might reason that the law is in place for the greater good, but that's beyond the question.

So perhaps the best answer here is E: "It's the law." Because it's about adhering to societal rules, which is the essence of the conventional level.

But wait, I remember that in Kohlberg's stages, stage 3 is about social approval, and stage 4 is about law and order. So both are conventional.

But the way the question is phrased, which explanation best illustrates the conventional level. So perhaps any of these options (E, F, J) could fit, but the answer is likely E because it's directly about the law.

Alternatively, let me think about the other options. Option F is about parents' approval, which is more about personal relationships, so maybe more stage 3.

Option J is about being a good example, which is also about social expectations, so that's stage 3.

Option E is about the law, which is stage 4.

So the conventional level includes both stages, but perhaps the best answer here is E.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the conventional level includes both stage 3 and 4. So any of these could fit. The question is which option best illustrates it.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E.

Wait, but I think I might be mixing things up. Let me try to recall: stage 3 is about seeking approval, and stage 4 is about abiding by the law for societal stability.

So the question is about driving at the speed limit. The reason "it's the law" is stage 4, which is conventional. So that's a good fit.

But another option is F: wanting parents to approve, which is stage 3, also conventional.

So both E and F are correct, but the question is asking for the best illustration.

Hmm. Maybe the answer is either E or F, but I'm not sure which is considered more conventional.

Wait, the question is about the conventional level, which includes both stages, but perhaps the more definitive answer is E because it's about societal laws, which are a broader social norm than just parental approval.

Alternatively, perhaps option J is about being a role model, which is stage 3.

Wait, in the given options, E, F, and J are all conventional.

But the question is which one best illustrates the conventional level. So I think the intended answer is E, because it's about the law, which is a key aspect of the conventional level.

But I'm a bit uncertain. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is F, because it's about social approval.

Wait, let me think again. Kohlberg's conventional level is about conforming to societal norms and expectations. So wanting to obey the law because it's the law (E) is about societal norms, whereas wanting parents' approval (F) is about personal relationships. So E is more about societal norms, making it a better fit for the conventional level.

So I think the answer is E.

Kohlberg's theory of moral development includes three levels: pre-conventional, conventional, and post-conventional. The conventional level, which includes stages 3 and 4, focuses on adhering to social norms, rules, and expectations. Stage 3 emphasizes seeking approval from others, while stage 4 emphasizes upholding societal laws and norms for the greater good.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Practicality, not moral reasoning.
- **Option B**: Personal choice, unrelated to morality.
- **Option C**: Seeking peer approval, fits stage 3 (conventional).
- **Option D**: Personal preference, not moral reasoning.
- **Option E**: Obeying the law, fits stage 4 (conventional).
- **Option F**: Seeking parental approval, fits stage 3 (conventional).
- **Option G**: Avoiding punishment, pre-conventional.
- **Option H**: Safety concern, not moral reasoning.
- **Option I**: Personal fear, not moral reasoning.
- **Option J**: Being a good example, fits stage 3 (conventional).

Both **E** and **F** align with the conventional level, but **E** ("It's the law") better illustrates the broader societal norms of stage 4, making it the most representative of the conventional level as a whole.

Answer: E
