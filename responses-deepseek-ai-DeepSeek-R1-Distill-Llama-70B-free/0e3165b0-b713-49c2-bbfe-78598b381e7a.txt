Okay, so I'm trying to figure out JimDagney's selling cost percentage. Hmm, I remember that selling costs usually include things like salaries and commissions paid to salespeople. The question says that Jim's weekly sales average $2,000, and his average weekly earnings are $120. I think the selling cost percentage would be the earnings as a percentage of the sales. 

So, the formula I think I should use is (Earnings / Sales) * 100 to get the percentage. Let me plug in the numbers. His earnings are $120, and sales are $2,000. So 120 divided by 2000 is 0.06. Multiply that by 100 gives 6%. 

Wait, let me double-check that. So 120 divided by 2000. Let me do that calculation again. 120 รท 2000. Well, 2000 divided by 100 is 20, so 120 divided by 20 is 6. Oh wait, no, that's 120 divided by 2000. Oh wait, 2000 times 0.06 is 120, right? Because 2000 * 0.05 is 100, so 0.06 is 120. Yeah, that makes sense. 

So the selling cost percentage is 6%. Looking at the options, option E is 6%. So the answer should be E.

The selling cost percentage is calculated by dividing Jim's weekly earnings by his weekly sales and then multiplying by 100. 

\[
\text{Selling Cost Percentage} = \left( \frac{120}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 6\%
\]

From the options provided, the correct answer is E: 6%.
