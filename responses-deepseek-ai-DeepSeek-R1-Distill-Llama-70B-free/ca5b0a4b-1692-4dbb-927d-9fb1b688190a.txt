Question:

A distributor agrees to sell 100 tubes of growth hormone to a medical treatment center in exchange for $30,000. The contract has many clauses, including one that prohibits generally the assignment of the contract or any of its terms. The distributor assigns its right to receive the funds anyway. Will a court enforce the bar against assignment under these circumstances?

Options:

A: No, a bar of assignment does not apply to the right to receive the funds unless specifically stated.
B: Yes, unless the contract explicitly states that the bar of assignment does not apply to the right to receive funds.
C: No, a bar of assignment can only be enforced if it is notarized and legally binding.
D: Yes, a bar against the right to receive proceeds is a favored restriction unless otherwise stated.
E: Yes, a contractual provision prohibiting assignments is enforceable in all respects.
F: Yes, a bar of assignment applies to all aspects of the contract, including the right to receive funds.
G: No, a bar of assignment is an unconstitutional deprivation of due process.
H: No, a bar of assignment is unenforceable if it inhibits the completion of the contract.
I: No, a court will not enforce the bar against assignment as it infringes upon the distributor's right to do business.
J: Yes, a contractual provision prohibiting assignments is enforceable unless it contradicts federal law.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this contract law question about assignment of rights. Let's see, the question is about whether a court will enforce a clause that prohibits assignment when the distributor assigns their right to receive funds anyway.

Alright, let me start by recalling what I know about contract assignments. Generally, contract rights can be assigned unless there's a specific restriction. But sometimes, contracts include clauses that prohibit assignment, and these are usually enforceable, especially if they're clear and explicit.

In this case, the contract says that the assignment of the contract or any of its terms is prohibited. So the distributor is trying to assign the right to receive $30,000 despite this clause. The question is, does the court enforce this prohibition?

I think the general rule is that a contractual provision barring assignment is valid unless it's against public policy or some other exception. But there are exceptions, like when the assignment would materially change the duties or risks, especially in personal services contracts. But here, it's about receiving funds, which is a monetary right, not a duty that requires performance.

Wait, so when a contract prohibits assignment, does that apply to all rights under the contract, including the right to receive payment? I remember that the right to receive money is generally assignable unless the contract says otherwise. But if the contract explicitly prohibits assignment of any terms, including the right to receive funds, then maybe it's enforceable.

Looking at the options:

Option A says no, because a bar doesn't apply to funds unless specifically stated. Hmm, that suggests that unless the contract specifically says that the right to receive funds can't be assigned, it's allowed. But wait, the contract here does have a general bar on assignment of any terms, so maybe that includes the right to receive funds. So A might not be correct.

Option B says yes, unless the contract explicitly says the bar doesn't apply to funds. So if the contract's bar is general, the court would enforce it, but only if the exception isn't there. That sounds possible.

Option E says that a contractual prohibition is enforceable in all respects. That seems too broad. I don't think that's correct because there are exceptions, like when the assignment doesn't affect the obligor's duties. So E is probably wrong.

Option F says the bar applies to all aspects, including funds. That might be accurate if the contract's clause is broad enough. But I think the right to receive payment is a different matter because it's a chose in action and typically assignable unless specifically barred.

Wait, but if the contract's clause prohibits assignment of any terms, that would include the right to receive funds. So under that, the assignment would be prohibited, and the court would enforce it.

So looking again, the contract has a clause that prohibits assignment of the contract or any of its terms. So the right to receive funds is a term, so the assignment is prohibited.

So the answer would be that the court enforces the bar, so options that say yes would be correct.

Looking at the options, which ones say yes. Options B, D, E, F, J. Let's review.

Option B: Yes, unless the contract explicitly states that the bar doesn't apply to funds. But in this case, the contract does have a general bar, so the exception isn't present. So B would say yes, which aligns with the court enforcing it.

Option F: Yes, the bar applies to all aspects including funds. So F would also say yes.

Wait, but I thought that sometimes even with a general bar, certain rights like payment might still be assignable. Or is that only when the bar isn't explicit about such rights.

Another point: The UCC might have specific rules, but this isn't a sale of goods, it's a service (medical treatment). So common law applies. Under common law, a clause prohibiting assignment is generally enforceable unless it's against public policy or in certain situations.

So in this case, the assignment is of the right to receive funds, which is a monetary right. Courts are more likely to enforce a prohibition against assignment of duties, but for rights, especially monetary, they might not enforce a broad bar unless it's explicit.

Wait, so if the contract says you can't assign any terms, including the right to receive funds, then the court would enforce that. So in that case, the assignment is prohibited.

So looking at the options again, which one states that. Let me read each option carefully.

Option A: No, unless specifically stated. So if the contract doesn't specifically mention funds, then the bar doesn't apply. But here, the contract does have a broad bar, so A would say no, which would be incorrect.

Option B: Yes, unless the contract explicitly says the bar doesn't apply to funds. Since the contract's bar is general, not excluding funds, the court would enforce it. So B would say yes.

Option F: Yes, the bar applies to all aspects, including funds. So F is also a yes.

Hmm, so which is correct between B and F.

The question is, does a general bar on assignment of any terms include the right to receive funds, or does it require specific mention.

I think under common law, a general prohibition against assignment will prevent the assignment of rights unless the right is of a type that's not impacted by the assignment. For example, assigning the right to receive payment doesn't affect the obligor's duties because they just have to pay whoever the assignee is. So courts might be more willing to allow such assignments even with a general bar, unless the contract explicitly prohibits it.

Wait, but the contract here does have a general bar on assignment of any terms, which would include the right to receive payment. So does that mean the assignment is prohibited, or is the right to receive payment an exception?

I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think: The general rule is that a clause prohibiting assignment is enforceable. But there's an exception for the assignment of the right to receive payment, unless the contract specifically prohibits that.

So if the contract's clause is general, like "no assignment of any terms", does that include the right to receive funds? Or is the right to receive funds treated differently.

I think the right to receive funds can be assigned unless the contract specifically prohibits it. So a general bar might not be enough. So in this case, the contract's clause is general, so the assignment of the right to receive funds would still be allowed, because the clause doesn't specifically mention it.

Wait, but some sources say that a general anti-assignment clause does cover all rights under the contract, including the right to receive payment. So in that case, the assignment would be prohibited.

I'm a bit torn here. Let me try to find the correct approach.

Under the Restatement (Second) of Contracts ยง 322(1), a contract may prohibit the assignment of the right to receive payment unless the assignment would materially change the obligor's duty. Since payment to a different party doesn't change the duty, a prohibition against assignment of the right to receive payment is not necessarily valid unless the contract specifically includes it.

Wait, so if the contract has a general prohibition against assignment, but doesn't specifically mention the right to receive payment, then the assignment of that right is still allowed because it doesn't affect the obligor's duties. So the court would not enforce the general bar against assigning the right to receive funds.

In that case, the answer would be A: No, because the bar doesn't apply unless specifically stated.

But wait, other sources say that a general bar can cover all assignments, including payment rights, unless an exception applies.

Hmm, maybe I should think about real case law or more precise rules.

Upon checking, generally, a contractual provision barring assignment is valid unless it's against public policy. But when it comes to the assignment of the right to receive payment, courts are less likely to enforce a general bar because such assignments don't affect the obligor's duties. So a specific prohibition is needed.

So if the contract only has a general bar against assignment of any terms, but doesn't specifically say that the right to receive funds can't be assigned, then the assignment of the right to receive funds is allowed.

In this question, the contract's bar is general, not specifically mentioning funds. So the court would not enforce the bar against assigning the right to receive funds.

Wait, but the contract says "prohibits generally the assignment of the contract or any of its terms." So that would include the right to receive funds as a term. So the assignment is prohibited.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

If the contract says you can't assign any of its terms, then any term, including the right to receive payment, can't be assigned. So the assignment is prohibited, and the court enforces the bar.

So which option reflects that? Option F says yes, the bar applies to all aspects including funds.

So the correct answer would be F.

Wait, but earlier I thought that for the right to receive funds, even with a general bar, it might be allowed. But now I'm thinking that if the contract explicitly includes all terms, the right to receive funds is a term, so the bar applies.

I think the correct approach is that a general bar against assignment of any terms would include the right to receive funds, so the court would enforce the bar, making the assignment invalid.

So the correct answer would be F: Yes, a bar of assignment applies to all aspects of the contract, including the right to receive funds.

But wait, another angle: some jurisdictions might hold that the right to receive payment is always assignable unless specifically prohibited. So a general bar wouldn't suffice.

In that case, the answer would be A: No, because the bar doesn't apply to funds unless specifically stated.

I'm getting stuck here because different sources might have different approaches.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A, because the right to receive funds is considered a separate right that's assignable unless the contract specifically prohibits it, even if there's a general anti-assignment clause.

So in this problem, since the contract only has a general bar, the assignment of the right to receive funds is allowed, so the court won't enforce the bar.

So the answer would be A.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. I think the majority rule is that a general anti-assignment clause does not prevent the assignment of the right to receive payment, because such an assignment doesn't impose any additional burdens on the obligor. Thus, the court would not enforce the bar in this case.

So the correct answer would be A: No, a bar of assignment does not apply to the right to receive the funds unless specifically stated.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer is A.

To determine whether a court will enforce the bar against assignment in this scenario, it is essential to analyze the contractual language and the applicable legal principles. The contract includes a general clause prohibiting the assignment of the contract or any of its terms. The distributor attempts to assign the right to receive $30,000 despite this clause. The question is whether this assignment is enforceable.

Under general contract law, a contractual provision barring assignment is enforceable unless it violates public policy or is otherwise unenforceable under specific exceptions. However, the right to receive payment is typically treated differently from other contractual rights. Courts are more likely to allow the assignment of the right to receive funds because it does not materially alter the obligor's duties or risks. For a bar against assignment to apply to the right to receive funds, the contract must specifically prohibit such an assignment. A general bar against assignment of "any of its terms" is not sufficient to prevent the assignment of the right to receive funds unless explicitly stated.

In this case, the contract's clause is general and does not specifically address the right to receive funds. Therefore, the assignment of the right to receive funds would likely be allowed, and the court would not enforce the general bar against assignment in this context.
