Okay, so I've got this question about jurisprudence schools, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. The question is asking which school believes that law is an aggregate of social traditions and customs developed over centuries. The options are A through J, with various terms like Command, Sociological, Historical, etc.

Hmm, I remember that jurisprudence has different schools like natural law, positivist, historical, sociological, etc. Each has different views on what law is.

The question is about the school that sees law as coming from social traditions and customs. So I'm thinking about which school focuses on the historical development and evolution of law based on tradition.

I think the Historical School of jurisprudence is the one. From what I recall, this school emphasizes that law is not just made by the state but grows out of the collective habits and traditions of the people. It's more about customary law and how legal systems develop over time through social practices.

Wait, but there's also the Sociological school. I think the Sociological school looks at law in relation to society, focusing on social structures and how law serves society's needs. So maybe that's a contender too.

But the key here is that the question mentions "aggregate of social traditions and customs over centuries." That sounds more like the Historical approach, which sees law as evolving from the community's history and traditions rather than being imposed by a ruler or based on social functions.

So putting it together, the Historical School fits because it's about the gradual development through customs and traditions. Therefore, the answer should be option C: Historical.

The Historical School of jurisprudence is the correct answer because it emphasizes that law evolves from social traditions and customs over time, rather than being imposed by the state. This aligns with the question's focus on the gradual development of law through community practices.
