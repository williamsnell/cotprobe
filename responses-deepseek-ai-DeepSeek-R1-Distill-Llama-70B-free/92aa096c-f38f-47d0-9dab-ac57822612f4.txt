Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about calculating the change in entropy when a certain amount of heat is transferred to a block of iron. Hmm, I remember that entropy change has something to do with heat transfer and temperature.

Alright, the problem states that 25 kJ of energy is transferred reversibly and isothermally as heat to a large block of iron at 0°C. I need to find the entropy change. Oh wait, right! When the process is reversible and isothermal, the formula ΔS = Q_rev / T applies. But wait, I should make sure about the conditions here.

So the iron is at 0°C, which I should convert to Kelvin because the formula uses absolute temperature. 0°C is 273.15 K. Got it. The heat Q is given as 25 kJ, which is 25,000 J. Wait, but since it's being transferred to the iron, is Q positive? I think so, because the system is gaining heat.

So plugging into the formula, ΔS = Q / T. But wait, what's the correct sign here? Oh right, when heat is added to the system, the entropy increases, so Q should be positive. So Q is 25,000 J, T is 273.15 K.

Let me calculate that. 25,000 divided by 273.15. Hmm, let's see. 25,000 / 273 is approximately... well, 273 times 90 is 24,570, right? Because 273 * 90 = 24,570. So 25,000 -24,570 is 430. So 90 + (430 / 273). 430/273 is about 1.575. So around 91.575 J/K. Wait, but wait a second: the actual temperature is 273.15 K, not 273. So maybe I should be more precise.

Alternatively, maybe I should use a calculator approach. 25,000 / 273.15. Let's compute that.

Let me think: 273.15 * 91 is 273.15 *90 = 24585.75, plus 273.15 = 24858.9. Hmm, 25,000 is 141.1 higher than that. 273.15 * 0.5 is 136.575. So 91.5 would give 24858.9 + 136.575= 24,995.475. Oh wait, that's really close to 25,000. So 25,000 / 273.15 is approximately 91.5 plus a bit. Because 24,995.475 is 4.525 less than 25,000. So 4.525 / 273.15 is about 0.0165. So total is approximately 91.5165 J/K.

Wait, but let me think again. The entropy change is for the iron block. Since the process is isothermal and reversible, the heat transferred is Q = TΔS. So ΔS = Q / T. So that's correct.

Looking at the options, option F is 92 J/K^-1, which is close to my calculation. But wait, wait another thing. Is the process reversible? The problem says it's transferred reversibly and isothermally. So yes, the formula holds.

Wait, but wait again. Iron is a solid, right? So when you transfer heat to it at a constant temperature, what's happening? Oh wait, no, if it's isothermal, the temperature doesn't change. So the heat is being transferred without changing the temperature, which probably involves a phase change or something else. But in this case, the iron is at 0 degrees Celsius. Wait, 0 degrees C is the melting point of ice. But iron's melting point is way higher, around 1538°C. So at 0°C, iron is solid. So when you add heat isothermally, perhaps it's going through a phase change? No, because it's a solid, so it's just heating... Wait, no, the temperature isn't changing because the block is large. Oh, right, the block is large, so the heat added doesn't change its temperature—so it's an isothermal process because the block is acting like a reservoir.

Wait, but then why can you transfer heat reversibly and isothermally? Oh, because the block is so large that its temperature doesn't change when you add heat. So the process is considered reversible because the heat transfer is done in a quasi-static manner, I guess.

So the formula still holds. So ΔS = 25000 J / 273.15 K ≈ 91.5 J/K. Looking at the options, the closest one is F, which is 92 J/K^-1.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. Let me compute 25000 / 273.15 exactly. Let me do this more accurately.

273.15 K is the temperature.

25000 ÷ 273.15 = ?

Let me compute 273.15 * 91 = 91 * 273 = let's see, 90*273=24570, plus 1*273=273, total 24843. Then 273.15 is 0.15 more than 273, so 91 * 0.15=13.65. So 273.15 *91=24843 +13.65 = 24856.65.

25000 - 24856.65 = 143.35.

So 143.35 / 273.15 = approximately 0.5248.

So the total is 91 + 0.5248 = 91.5248 ≈ 91.52 J/K.

The options are in whole numbers, except F, which is 92. So F is 92.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are:

A: 135

B:50

C:150

D:100

E:85

F:92

G:65

H:110

I:120

J:75

So the correct answer should be F:92 J/K^-1.

To calculate the change in entropy when 25 kJ of energy is transferred reversibly and isothermally as heat to a large block of iron at $0^\circ \mathrm{C}$, we use the formula for entropy change:

\[
\Delta S = \frac{Q_{\text{rev}}}{T}
\]

Here:
- \( Q_{\text{rev}} = 25 \, \mathrm{kJ} = 25,000 \, \mathrm{J} \) (converted to joules),
- \( T = 0^\circ \mathrm{C} = 273.15 \, \mathrm{K} \) (converted to Kelvin).

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta S = \frac{25,000}{273.15}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\Delta S \approx 91.52 \, \mathrm{J} \, \mathrm{K}^{-1}
\]

The closest option to this value is \( 92 \, \mathrm{J} \, \mathrm{K}^{-1} \), which corresponds to option F.

Thus, the final answer is:

**F**

The last character of the response is **F**.
