Okay, I'm trying to solve this thermodynamics problem. Let's see what the question is about. So, we have 2 moles of an ideal gas undergoing a reversible isothermal expansion at 0°C. The heat absorbed is 750 cal, and the external pressure is 1 atm. We need to find the final volume.

Hmm, I remember that for an isothermal process, the internal energy change ΔU is zero because the temperature doesn't change. So all the heat absorbed should be equal to the work done by the gas. Oh right, the first law of thermodynamics says ΔU = q + w. Since ΔU is zero, q equals -w. But wait, in physics, work done by the system is considered negative, so I think the formula might be q = w here. Or maybe I should be careful with the signs.

Wait, the heat absorbed by the system is positive q. Since the gas is expanding, it's doing work on the surroundings, so work done by the system is positive. So yeah, for an isothermal expansion, q = nRT ln(V2/V1) = work done. Or wait, the formula I remember is q = nRT ln(V2/V1) when it's reversible and isothermal.

Wait, the process is reversible, which makes sense because the question states it's a reversible expansion. So the formula should apply here.

But wait, the heat absorbed is given as 750 cal. Oh, but I should convert that into joules maybe? Or perhaps I can work in calories since R is sometimes given in cal units.

Wait, R is 8.314 J/mol·K, but I also remember that sometimes it's 1.987 cal/(mol·K). Oh, right, because 1 cal is about 4.184 joules. So I can use R = 1.987 cal/(mol·K) if I'm working in calories.

The temperature is 0°C, which is 273 K. So T = 273 K.

So the formula is q = nRT ln(V2/V1). We can rearrange that to find V2. Wait, but I'm looking for V2, the final volume. We know n=2 moles, T=273 K, R=1.987 cal/(mol·K), q=750 cal.

Wait, but wait: the expansion is against an external pressure of 1 atm. Oh, but for reversible processes, the external pressure is equal to the internal pressure. So in this case, since it's reversible, the pressure is changing gradually. But for isothermal reversible expansion, the work done is nRT ln(V2/V1), which is also equal to the heat absorbed q, because ΔU is zero.

Wait, but the heat absorbed is q = 750 cal, which equals the work done. So using the equation q = nRT ln(V2/V1), we can solve for V2.

Wait, but wait again: the initial pressure is 1 atm, but since it's reversible, the pressure changes as the volume changes. So the initial state is P1 = 1 atm, V1 = nRT/P1. Let me calculate V1 first.

V1 = (nRT)/P1. Let's compute that. n=2, R=0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) because when using atm and liters, R is 0.0821. Oh wait, earlier I thought about using R in cal units, but since pressure is in atm and volume in liters, maybe it's better to use R = 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

Wait, but the q is given in calories, so I might need to reconcile the units. Alternatively, since the heat is in calories, and R can be in cal units, perhaps that's better.

Wait, let's clarify. The formula for work done in a reversible isothermal expansion is W = nRT ln(V2/V1). And since q = W, that's because the internal energy doesn't change. So q = nRT ln(V2/V1). So if I can compute that, I can find V2.

But wait, I'm given the heat as 750 cal. So let me plug in the numbers.

n=2, R=1.987 cal/(mol·K), T=273 K.

So q = 2 * 1.987 * 273 * ln(V2/V1) = 750 cal.

Let me compute 2 * 1.987 = ~3.974.

3.974 * 273 = Let's see, 3.974 * 200 is 794.8, 3.974 *73 is approximately 3.974*70=278.18, 3.974*3=11.922 → total 290.102. So 794.8 + 290.102 = 1084.902. So 1084.902 * ln(V2/V1) = 750.

So ln(V2/V1) = 750 / 1084.902 ≈ 0.6915.

So V2/V1 = e^0.6915 ≈ let's compute that. e^0.7 is approximately 2.0138. But 0.6915 is slightly less than 0.7, so maybe around 2.0.

But to get more precise, maybe I can compute e^0.6915.

Alternatively, using the fact that ln(2) is about 0.6931. Oh wait, that's very close to 0.6915. So ln(2) ≈ 0.6931, which is just a bit higher than our 0.6915. So V2/V1 is just a little less than 2. Maybe approximately 1.995, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Taylor expansion for e^x around x=0.6931, but that might complicate.

Wait, since 0.6915 is 0.6931 - 0.0016. So e^(0.6931 - 0.0016) = e^0.6931 * e^-0.0016. e^0.6931 is exactly 2, and e^-0.0016 ≈ 1 - 0.0016 + (0.0016^2)/2, which is approximately 0.9984. So 2 * 0.9984 = 1.9968. So V2/V1 ≈ 1.9968, so V2 ≈ 1.9968 * V1.

So now I need to find V1, the initial volume.

V1 is given by the ideal gas law: V1 = nRT/P1.

n=2, R=0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) (since we're using pressure in atm and volume in liters), T=273 K, P1=1 atm.

So V1 = 2 * 0.0821 * 273 / 1 = 2 * 0.0821 * 273.

Compute that: 0.0821 * 273 = let's compute 0.08 * 273 = 21.84, 0.0021*273=0.5733. So total 21.84 + 0.5733 = 22.4133. Then multiply by 2: 44.8266 liters.

So V1 ≈ 44.8266 L.

Then V2 = V1 * 1.9968 ≈ 44.8266 * 1.9968.

Let me compute that:

44.8266 * 2 = 89.6532.

But since it's multiplied by 1.9968, which is 2 - 0.0032.

So 44.8266 * (2 - 0.0032) = 89.6532 - (44.8266 * 0.0032).

Compute 44.8266 * 0.0032: 44.8266 * 0.003 = 0.13448, 44.8266 * 0.0002 = 0.008965. So total 0.13448 + 0.008965 = 0.143445.

So 89.6532 - 0.143445 ≈ 89.5098 liters.

Wait, but let me check: I approximated V2/V1 as 1.9968, but perhaps I should be more accurate. Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator would give a more accurate value. Let's compute ln(V2/V1)=0.6915.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately without approximating. Let me recalculate.

We have q = 750 cal = nRT ln(V2/V1).

n=2, R=1.987 cal/(mol·K), T=273 K.

So 750 = 2 * 1.987 * 273 * ln(V2/V1).

Compute 2 *1.987 = 3.974.

3.974 * 273 = let's compute 3 * 273 =819, 0.974 *273: 0.9*273=245.7, 0.074*273≈20.202 → total 819 + 245.7=1064.7 +20.202=1084.902.

So 750 = 1084.902 * ln(V2/V1).

So ln(V2/V1) = 750 / 1084.902 ≈ 0.69147.

So V2/V1 = e^(0.69147) ≈ e^0.69147.

Let me compute e^0.69147 accurately.

I know that ln(2) is 0.693147, so 0.69147 is just a bit less than ln(2). So e^0.69147 = approximately 1.9965.

So V2 = V1 * 1.9965.

V1 is 44.8266 L as before.

So V2 = 44.8266 * 1.9965 ≈ let's compute 44.8266 * 2 =89.6532, then subtract 44.8266 * 0.0035.

Because 1.9965 = 2 - 0.0035.

So 44.8266 * 0.0035 = let's calculate:

44.8266 * 0.003 = 0.13448.

44.8266 * 0.0005 = 0.0224133.

So total 0.13448 + 0.0224133 = 0.156893.

So 89.6532 - 0.156893 = 89.4963 liters.

Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 100.3, which is higher, option E is 66.7, which is lower. Wait, none of the options is around 89.5. But wait let me check the options again.

Options are:

A:80.5

B:60.4

C:100.3

D:50.2

E:66.7

F:45.0

G:85.9

H:90.6

I:55.5

J:75.8

Wait, option H is 90.6 liters, which is close to my calculation of 89.5 liters. But why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let's think again.

Wait, another approach: since the process is reversible and isothermal, the work done is W = nRT ln(V2/V1).

But work done by the gas is also W = P_ext * ΔV, but only when the pressure is constant. Wait, no, that's for irreversible processes. Because in reversible processes, the pressure is changing, so we can't use P_ext * (V2 - V1).

Wait, but the correct formula for work done in reversible process is indeed W = nRT ln(V2/V1).

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the work done as the integral of P dV. Since it's isothermal, P = nRT/V, so W = integral from V1 to V2 of (nRT/V) dV = nRT ln(V2/V1).

So yes, the formula holds. So the calculation should be correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculating V1?

V1 = nRT/P. n=2, R=0.0821 L·atm/mol·K, T=273 K, P=1 atm.

So V1 = 2 * 0.0821 * 273 = 2 * 22.41 ≈44.82 L. That seems correct.

Then V2 = 44.82 * e^(0.69147) ≈44.82 *1.9965 ≈ 89.5 L.

But the closest option is H:90.6 L. Hmm, why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong value for R. Let me check. R is 8.314 J/mol·K, but in calories, it's 1.987 cal/(mol·K). Wait, wait, wait. 1 calorie is 4.184 joules, so 8.314 J/mol·K * (1 cal /4.184 J) ≈ 1.987 cal/(mol·K). So that part is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial pressure is not 1 atm but the external pressure is 1 atm. Wait, in a reversible process, the external pressure is almost equal to the internal pressure. So for the initial state, the pressure is 1 atm, same as external. So V1 is correct.

Wait, perhaps the heat absorbed is given as 750 cal, but maybe that's including some other factor. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that the heat is q = 750 cal, but that's the heat at constant volume, but no, the process is isothermal, so the heat is directly related to the work.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the calculation steps.

Compute q = nRT ln(V2/V1)

n=2, R=1.987 cal/(mol·K), T=273 K.

So q = 2 * 1.987 * 273 * ln(V2/V1) = 750.

Compute 2 * 1.987 = 3.974.

3.974 *273 = let's compute 3 * 273 = 819, 0.974 *273: 0.9*273=245.7, 0.074*273=20.202 → 245.7 +20.202=265.902. So 819 +265.902 = 1084.902.

So 1084.902 * ln(V2/V1) =750 → ln(V2/V1)=750/1084.902 ≈0.69147.

So V2/V1 = e^0.69147 ≈1.9965.

V1 is 44.8266, so V2=44.8266 * 1.9965 ≈ 89.5 L.

The options don't have exactly 89.5, but H is 90.6, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the R value when calculating V1.

Wait, wait, V1 is calculated using R=0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). Let me confirm that.

Yes, R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) when using atm, liters, and Kelvin. So V1 = (2)(0.0821)(273)/(1) = 44.8266 L. That's correct.

Wait, but let me compute 0.0821 *273 exactly.

0.0821 *273:

0.08 *273 = 21.84

0.0021 *273 = 0.5733.

So 21.84 + 0.5733 =22.4133.

Multiply by 2: 44.8266 L. Correct.

So V2 =44.8266 * 1.9965 ≈ 89.5 L.

The options don't have exactly 89.5, but option H is 90.6 L, which is close. But why the exact value isn't there. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in solving for V2/V1.

Wait, maybe I should compute e^(0.69147) more accurately.

Let me compute it using a calculator method.

We can use the Taylor series expansion around x=0.6931 (which is ln(2)).

Alternatively, I can use natural logarithm tables or a calculator, but since I don't have that, perhaps I can compute it more accurately.

Another approach: using the approximation:

e^x ≈ 1 + x + x²/2 + x³/6 + x^4/24.

x=0.69147.

Compute:

x=0.69147

x² = (0.69147)^2 ≈ 0.4780.

x³ = x² * x ≈0.4780 *0.69147 ≈0.3303.

x^4 ≈0.3303 *0.69147≈0.2286.

So e^0.69147 ≈1 + 0.69147 + 0.4780/2 + 0.3303/6 + 0.2286/24.

Compute each term:

1 =1

+0.69147 →1.69147

+0.4780/2=0.239 →1.93047

+0.3303/6≈0.05505 →1.98552

+0.2286/24≈0.009525 →1.995045.

So e^0.69147≈1.995.

So V2=44.8266 *1.995≈44.8266 *2=89.6532 minus 44.8266 *0.005=0.2241.

So 89.6532 -0.2241=89.4291 L.

Hmm, that's about 89.43 L.

Looking at the options, the closest is H:90.6. But that's not exact. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the question gives the external pressure as 1 atm, and the expansion is against this pressure. But in a reversible process, the external pressure is almost equal to the internal pressure. Wait, but in this case, the initial pressure is 1 atm, so when the gas expands, the pressure changes, but the external pressure remains 1 atm. Wait, no, in a reversible process, the external pressure is adjusted to be equal to the internal pressure at every step, so the expansion is quasistatic. So the formula I used should still hold.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the work done is P_ext (V2 - V1). But that's only for irreversible expansion where the external pressure is constant. So in that case, W = P_ext (V2 - V1).

But since the process is reversible, the formula W = nRT ln(V2/V1) should be the correct one.

Wait, the
