Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about ammonium nitrate decomposing into laughing gas and water. Hmm, I remember that when ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) is heated, it breaks down into N2O, which is laughing gas, and water. The question gives me 10 grams of NH4NO3 and asks how many liters of N2O I can collect at STP.

First, I think I need to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction. Let me try to recall. I think the products are N2O and H2O. So the reactant is NH4NO3. Let's see:

The formula for ammonium nitrate is NH4NO3. When it decomposes, probably it's something like:

NH4NO3 → N2O + H2O

But I'm not sure about the coefficients. I need to balance this equation.

Let me count the atoms on each side. Left side: NH4NO3 has 2 N atoms (one from NH4+ and one from NO3^-), 4 H, and 3 O. Wait, no, the O in NH4NO3 is 3 from NO3 and maybe some from NH4, but NH4 is NH4+ which has no O. So total O in NH4NO3 is 3 (from nitrate). So in the reactant, we have N: 2, H:4, O:3.

On the product side, N2O has 2 N and 1 O, and H2O has 2 H and 1 O. So let me write the unbalanced equation:

NH4NO3 → N2O + H2O

Let's balance N first. On the left, 2 N. On the right, N2O has 2 N. So maybe the coefficient for N2O is 1. Then, looking at H: left is 4 H, right is 2 H in H2O. So to balance H, I need 2 H2O molecules. Because 2 H2O gives 4 H. Let's try that.

So:

NH4NO3 → N2O + 2 H2O

Now, count O. Left: 3 O. Right: N2O has 1 O, 2 H2O have 2*(1 O) = 2 O. Total O on right is 3. Which matches the O on the left. So the equation is balanced as is.

So the balanced equation is:

NH4NO3 → N2O + 2 H2O

Now, the molar ratio is 1 mole of NH4NO3 producing 1 mole of N2O.

So the next step is to find out how many moles of NH4NO3 we have. The mass given is 10 grams. The molar mass of NH4NO3 is calculated as:

Nitrogen (N): 14.01 g/mol × 2 = 28.02
Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol ×4 =4.032
Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol ×3 =48.00

Adding these together: 28.02 +4.032 +48 = 80.052 g/mol approximately. Wait, let me calculate more accurately.

N: 14.01 ×2 = 28.02
H: 1.008 ×4 =4.032
O: 16.00 ×3=48.00
Total: 28.02 + 4.032 = 32.052; 32.052 +48=80.052 g/mol.

So molar mass is about 80.05 g/mol.

Molar mass = 80.05 g/mol.

So 10 grams / 80.05 g/mol = moles of NH4NO3.

Let me calculate that. 10 / 80.05 is approximately 0.1249 moles. Let me double-check the division: 80 goes into 10 0.1249 times? Yeah, because 80 * 0.125 is 10. So 80.05 is a bit more, so 0.1249 is correct.

So moles of NH4NO3 is approximately 0.1249.

From the balanced equation, 1 mole NH4NO3 → 1 mole N2O. So moles of N2O produced is 0.1249 moles.

At STP, 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters. So 0.1249 moles × 22.4 L/mol = liters of N2O.

Let me calculate that. 0.1249 ×22.4. Let's see, 0.12 ×22.4 is 2.688. 0.0049 ×22.4 is approximately 0.10976. So total is about 2.688 + 0.10976 = 2.79776 liters, approximately 2.8 liters.

Wait, looking at the options, option H is 2.8 liters. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but wait, is the molar ratio correct? Let me double-check the equation.

Yes, the equation is 1:1 for NH4NO3 to N2O. So the moles are correct.

Hmm, but wait another thing: when I calculated the molar mass of NH4NO3, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of atoms.

Wait, NH4NO3: NH4+ has N, 4 H. NO3^- has 1 N and 3 O. So the formula is NH4NO3, which is correct. So the molar mass calculation is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recount:

NH4NO3: N is 2 atoms (one from NH4, one from NO3), H is 4, O is 3.

So molar mass:

N: 14.01 * 2 = 28.02
H: 1.008 *4 =4.032
O:16.00 *3=48.00

Total: 28.02 +4.032=32.052; 32.052 +48=80.052 g/mol. So 80.05 g/mol.

So yes, 10 grams is 0.1249 moles. So N2O is 0.1249 moles.

At STP, 22.4 L/mol → 0.1249 *22.4 = ?

Let me compute 0.1249 ×22.4:

0.1 ×22.4=2.24

0.02 ×22.4=0.448 → total 2.688

0.0049 ×22.4=0.10976

So 2.24 + 0.448 = 2.688; 2.688 +0.10976=2.79776 liters, approximately 2.8 liters.

Looking at the options, option H is 2.8 liters. So the correct answer is H.

To determine how many liters of laughing gas (N₂O) can be collected at STP when 10 grams of ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) is heated, we start by writing and balancing the chemical equation:

\[
\text{NH}_4\text{NO}_3 \rightarrow \text{N}_2\text{O} + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}
\]

From the equation, 1 mole of NH₄NO₃ produces 1 mole of N₂O. Next, we calculate the molar mass of NH₄NO₃:

- Nitrogen (N): \(14.01 \, \text{g/mol} \times 2 = 28.02 \, \text{g/mol}\)
- Hydrogen (H): \(1.008 \, \text{g/mol} \times 4 = 4.032 \, \text{g/mol}\)
- Oxygen (O): \(16.00 \, \text{g/mol} \times 3 = 48.00 \, \text{g/mol}\)

Adding these together gives the molar mass of NH₄NO₃ as \(80.052 \, \text{g/mol}\).

The number of moles of NH₄NO₃ in 10 grams is:

\[
\text{Moles of NH}_4\text{NO}_3 = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{10}{80.052} \approx 0.1249 \, \text{moles}
\]

Since the molar ratio of NH₄NO₃ to N₂O is 1:1, the moles of N₂O produced are also \(0.1249 \, \text{moles}\).

At STP, 1 mole of gas occupies \(22.4 \, \text{L}\). Therefore, the volume of N₂O collected is:

\[
\text{Volume of N}_2\text{O} = \text{Moles of N}_2\text{O} \times 22.4 \, \text{L/mol} = 0.1249 \times 22.4 \approx 2.8 \, \text{L}
\]

Thus, the correct answer is **H: 2.8 liters**.

H
