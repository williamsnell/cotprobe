Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a liquid-propellant rocket, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question says.

The rocket uses 22 lb of fuel per second and 300 lb of oxidant per second. The exhaust gases leave at 2,000 fps. I need to calculate the rocket thrust. The options are given from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that rocket thrust has something to do with the mass flow rate and the exhaust velocity. Oh right, the formula for thrust (F) is F = (dm/dt) * Ve, where dm/dt is the mass flow rate and Ve is the exhaust velocity.

Wait, but wait a second. The rocket uses both fuel and oxidant. So the total mass flow rate is the sum of the fuel and oxidant, right? So I need to add those two together.

So, fuel is 22 lb/s and oxidant is 300 lb/s. So total dm/dt = 22 + 300 = 322 lb/s.

Ve is given as 2000 ft/s. So plugging into the formula: F = 322 * 2000. Let me calculate that.

322 * 2000. Well, 300 * 2000 is 600,000, and 22 * 2000 is 44,000. Adding those gives 644,000 lb. But wait, that's not one of the options. The options go up to 45,000 lb as the highest. Hmmm, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake?

Oh wait! Maybe I'm confusing pounds as force and pounds as mass. Because in the imperial system, pounds can be a bit tricky because they're used for both mass (lb) and force (lbf). So I think the formula actually uses the mass flow rate multiplied by the exhaust velocity, but in the correct units.

Wait, no, the units should be consistent. Let me think again. The exhaust velocity is in feet per second, and the mass flow rate is in lb/s. So the thrust F would be in (lb/s)(ft/s) = lb·ft/s². But wait, 1 lbf is equal to (1 lbm)(32.174 ft/s²) due to gravity. So maybe I need to convert the mass flow rate from lb/s to lbm/s.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The formula F = (dm/dt) * Ve is correct, but in the units. So dm/dt is in slugs per second, and Ve is in feet per second, so F would be in slug·ft/s², which is equivalent to lbf (pound-force). Because 1 slug is 32.174 lbm.

Wait, maybe I should convert the mass flow rate from lb/s to slugs/s. Because 1 slug is 32.174 lbm. So mass flow rate in slugs/s would be (322 lb/s) / 32.174 lbm/slug ≈ 10 slug/s.

Wait, let me compute that: 322 / 32.174 is approximately 10. So 322 / 32.174 ≈ 10. So 10 slugs/s.

Then, F = (dm/dt) * Ve = 10 slugs/s * 2000 ft/s = 20,000 slug·ft/s². But since 1 slug·ft/s² is 1 lbf, F would be 20,000 lbf. So that would correspond to option F: 20,000 lb.

Wait, but wait again. The total mass flow rate is 322 lb/s. But wait, in the formula, the mass flow rate is in lbm/s (mass per second), but we have to convert to slugs per second because the units in the formula require that. Because in imperial units, F = dm/dt (slug/s) * Ve (ft/s). So, because 1 slug is 32.174 lbm, the 322 lb/s is 322 lbm/s.

So to convert 322 lbm/s to slugs/s: 322 / 32.174 ≈ 10 slugs/s.

Then F = 10 * 2000 = 20,000 lbf. So the answer would be F: 20,000 lb.

But wait, another way to think about it: sometimes the formula is written as F = (m_dot * Ve) / (gc), where gc is the gravitational conversion factor. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, let me check units again. The formula F = (dm/dt) * Ve should give units of force. So (dm/dt) in lbm/s, Ve in ft/s. So lbm/s * ft/s = (lbm·ft)/(s²). To convert that to lbf, since 1 lbf = 1 lbm * 32.174 ft/s², so 1 lbm·ft/s² = 1/(32.174) lbf. So F in lbf would be (dm/dt * Ve) / 32.174.

So let me recalculate that. dm/dt is 322 lbm/s. Ve is 2000 ft/s. So F = (322 * 2000) / 32.174.

Calculate numerator: 322 * 2000 = 644,000.

Divide by 32.174: 644000 / 32.174 ≈ 20,000 lbf. So yes, that's 20,000 lb, which is option F.

Wait, but wait another thing. In some references, the formula for thrust is F = (m_dot_total) * Ve, where m_dot_total is the total mass flow rate in lbm/s, and Ve in ft/s. But without dividing by anything, that would give lbm·ft/s², which is not a standard unit for force. So I think the correct approach is to include the division by gc, which is 32.174 lbm·ft/(lbf·s²).

So F = (m_dot * Ve) / gc.

So m_dot is 322 lbm/s. Ve is 2000 ft/s. So F = (322 * 2000) / 32.174.

Compute 322 * 2000 = 644000.

644000 / 32.174 = approximately 20,000.

So yes, 20,000 lbf, which is option F.

To calculate the rocket thrust, we use the formula for thrust:

\[
F = \frac{\dot{m} \cdot V_e}{g_c}
\]

Where:
- \(\dot{m}\) is the total mass flow rate in lbm/s,
- \(V_e\) is the exhaust velocity in ft/s,
- \(g_c = 32.174 \, \text{lbm·ft/(lbf·s}^2)\) is the gravitational conversion factor.

### Step 1: Calculate the total mass flow rate
The rocket uses 22 lb/s of fuel and 300 lb/s of oxidant. Since these are mass flow rates, we add them together:

\[
\dot{m} = 22 + 300 = 322 \, \text{lbm/s}.
\]

### Step 2: Apply the formula
Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
F = \frac{322 \cdot 2000}{32.174}.
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
322 \cdot 2000 = 644,000.
\]

Now divide by \(g_c\):

\[
F = \frac{644,000}{32.174} \approx 20,000 \, \text{lbf}.
\]

### Final Answer
The rocket thrust is approximately **20,000 lb**, which corresponds to option **F**.

F
