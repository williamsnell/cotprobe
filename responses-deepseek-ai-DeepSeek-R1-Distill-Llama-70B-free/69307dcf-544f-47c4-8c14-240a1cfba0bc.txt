Question:

An on-duty Police Officer hears breaking glass and a blaring alarm, and sees Stan run out of a darkened liquor store at 3 a.m. Stan runs around the corner, out of Officer's view, and hops into a car. Officer sees Stan drive away and pursues, lights flashing. Stan pulls over and Officer arrests him. Officer sees nothing in the passenger compartment, but pops the trunk and finds cash and a baseball bat. Stan's motion to suppress the cash and baseball bat as evidence will likely be

Options:

A: Denied, because the Officer had a reasonable suspicion that Stan was involved in a crime.
B: Granted, because the arrest was illegal and therefore the evidence is considered to be fruit of the poisonous tree.
C: Granted, because the Officer did not have a search warrant to check the trunk of the car.
D: Granted, because the Officer did not have a valid reason to pull Stan over in the first place.
E: Denied, because a search incident to a valid arrest in an automobile always includes the trunk of the automobile.
F: Denied, because the Officer had probable cause to search the trunk.
G: Denied, because the Officer had the right to search the car without a warrant.
H: Granted, because the trunk area was out of the range of Stan's control.
I: Denied, because the Officer was in the pursuit of his duties and the search was incidental to the arrest.
J: Granted, because the Officer did not observe Stan commit any crime.

Okay, so I've got this question about criminal procedure and the Fourth Amendment, specifically dealing with searches and seizures. Hmm, I remember from my studies that the Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, and that there are exceptions like searches incident to arrest or probable cause.

So the scenario is: A police officer hears breaking glass and a blaring alarm at 3 a.m. He sees Stan run out of a darkened liquor store. Stan runs around the corner, gets into a car, and drives away. The officer pursues with lights flashing, Stan pulls over and is arrested. The officer doesn't find anything in the passenger compartment but pops the trunk and finds cash and a baseball bat. Now, Stan is moving to suppress this evidence.

I think the key issues here are whether the officer had the right to search the trunk and whether the arrest was lawful.

First, the arrest. The officer saw Stan running out of a liquor store with a broken alarm. That sounds like probable cause to arrest for burglary or theft. So the arrest itself was probably legal because the officer had probable cause.

Once Stan is arrested, the officer can conduct a search incident to arrest. But wait, in a car, the rules are a bit different. I remember the case of New York v. Belton, which says that when a police officer makes a lawful arrest of the occupants of a car, the officer may search the entire passenger compartment and any containers therein as a search incident to arrest. But I'm not sure if that includes the trunk.

Wait, Belton allows searching the passenger area but not necessarily the trunk. So if the officer searches the trunk without a warrant, is that allowed? Or does he need a separate probable cause for the trunk?

Another exception is the automobile exception, which allows warrantless searches of a car if there's probable cause to believe the car contains evidence of a crime. But I'm a bit confused about how that applies here.

In this case, the officer had probable cause to arrest Stan for burglary. After the arrest, Stan is in custody, so the incident to arrest search would allow the passenger compartment, but maybe not the trunk. Unless the officer has probable cause that the trunk contains evidence.

Wait, but the officer saw Stan running from a liquor store with breaking glass. So perhaps the officer would suspect that evidence, like stolen liquor or tools (like a baseball bat), might be in the car. So maybe the officer had probable cause to search the entire car, including the trunk, under the automobile exception.

Alternatively, under the search incident to arrest, the trunk isn't included unless the suspect could reach into it, which he can't because he's already arrested and likely in custody, so maybe the trunk isn't within his reach. So the officer might need a warrant or probable cause under the automobile exception.

Wait, but the automobile exception doesn't require a warrant if there's probable cause. So if the officer had probable cause to believe the trunk contained evidence, like the baseball bat and cash, then the search would be valid.

So in this scenario, the officer sees Stan running from a possible burglary (since the store's alarm is blaring and glass broke), which gives probable cause. So when he arrests Stan, he can search the car under the automobile exception because he has probable cause that the car contains evidence (like stolen goods or tools used in the crime).

So the search of the trunk would be valid under the automobile exception. Therefore, the motion to suppress would be denied because the officer had probable cause to search the trunk.

Wait, but let me think again. The initial arrest is valid, giving the officer the right to search the passenger compartment. But the trunk might require more. Alternatively, after the arrest, if the car is in police custody, they can get a warrant or maybe search it without if there's probable cause.

But the officer didn't need a warrant because of the automobile exception. So the search of the trunk was permissible because the officer had probable cause to believe evidence was present.

So looking at the options:

Option A: Denied because reasonable suspicion. But reasonable suspicion is for stops, not searches. Here, the officer had probable cause.

Option B: Granted because the arrest was illegal. But the arrest was legal, so B is incorrect.

Option C: Granted because no warrant for the trunk. But under the automobile exception, a warrant isn't needed if there's probable cause.

Option D: Granted because no reason to pull over. But the officer had probable cause to make the arrest, so the stop was valid.

Option E: Denied because search incident to arrest includes trunk. Wait, I thought Belton doesn't include the trunk, so E might be incorrect.

Option F: Denied because officer had probable cause to search the trunk. That sounds right because of the automobile exception.

Option G: Denied because officer can search without warrant. Well, that's true under the automobile exception, but does that apply here? Yes, because of probable cause.

Option H: Granted because trunk out of control. But the suspect was arrested and in custody, so maybe the trunk was accessible? Not sure, but I think H is about the area under the suspect's control, which in a car, once arrested, maybe the whole car is searchable.

Option I: Denied because pursuit and incidental arrest. That's a bit vague, but I think F is more precise.

Option J: Granted because no observed crime. But the officer had probable cause based on the circumstances, so J is wrong.

So the correct answer is either F or G. F says because of probable cause to search the trunk. G says because the officer can search without a warrant.

Wait, in the automobile exception, the search is allowed without a warrant if there's probable cause. So the fact that the officer didn't have a warrant isn't the issueâ€”probable cause is.

So the motion to suppress would be denied because the officer had probable cause to search the trunk. So F would be correct.

Alternatively, G says the officer can search without a warrant, which is true, but the key is whether the search was justified. So F is more accurate because it's about probable cause.

Wait, but the question is about the trunk. Under Belton, the trunk isn't included in a search incident to arrest. So the officer couldn't search the trunk under that doctrine. But under the automobile exception, yes, because he had probable cause.

So the officer's search of the trunk was valid under the automobile exception, so the evidence isn't suppressed. Thus, the motion to suppress would be denied.

Looking back at the options, F says Denied because the officer had probable cause to search the trunk. That fits.

So the answer should be F.

The scenario involves a police officer who arrests Stan after observing him run out of a liquor store with a blaring alarm and breaking glass at 3 a.m. The officer searches the car, finds nothing in the passenger compartment, but discovers cash and a baseball bat in the trunk. Stan moves to suppress this evidence. The key issues are the legality of the arrest, the scope of the search, and whether the officer had probable cause to search the trunk.

The arrest was lawful because the officer had probable cause to believe Stan was involved in a crime, based on the breaking glass, blaring alarm, and Stan running from the scene. Under **New York v. Belton**, a lawful arrest allows the officer to search the passenger compartment of the car, but not necessarily the trunk. However, the **automobile exception** to the Fourth Amendment permits a warrantless search of a car, including the trunk, if the officer has probable cause to believe the car contains evidence of a crime.

Here, the officer had probable cause to search the trunk because the circumstances (e.g., the liquor store alarm, breaking glass, and Stan's flight) suggested that evidence of a crime (e.g., stolen goods or tools like a baseball bat) might be present. Therefore, the search of the trunk was valid under the automobile exception, and the motion to suppress the evidence will likely be denied.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. While the officer had reasonable suspicion, the search was justified by probable cause, not just suspicion.
- **B**: Incorrect. The arrest was lawful, so the evidence is not "fruit of the poisonous tree."
- **C**: Incorrect. A warrant was not required because the search fell under the automobile exception.
- **D**: Incorrect. The officer had probable cause to pull Stan over and make the arrest.
- **E**: Incorrect. **Belton** does not include the trunk in a search incident to arrest, but the automobile exception applies here.
- **F**: Correct. The officer had probable cause to search the trunk under the automobile exception.
- **G**: Incorrect. While the officer could search without a warrant, the justification was based on probable cause, not just the absence of a warrant.
- **H**: Incorrect. The trunk was within the officer's authority to search under the automobile exception.
- **I**: Incorrect. The search was lawful, not merely incidental to the arrest.
- **J**: Incorrect. The officer had probable cause based on the circumstances, even without directly observing Stan commit a crime.

The best answer is **F**. 

Answer: F
