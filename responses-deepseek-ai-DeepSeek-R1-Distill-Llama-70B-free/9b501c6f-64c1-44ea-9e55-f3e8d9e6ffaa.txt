Okay, so I've got this problem about mass transfer over a naphthalene plate. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my mass transfer concepts, but let me try to think this through step by step.

The problem gives me an air stream flowing over a solid naphthalene plate. The velocity is 16 ft/s, pressure is 1 atm, and the temperature is 115°F. I need to find several things: average mass transfer coefficient, mass transfer rate, local coefficient, concentration gradient, and boundary layer thicknesses at 1.5 ft from the leading edge.

First, I remember that mass transfer in such scenarios often involves analogies between heat and mass transfer because the governing equations are similar. The key here is probably the Reynolds analogy, which relates the mass transfer coefficient to the heat transfer coefficient or the friction factor.

Wait, but wait. The problem is about mass transfer from a solid plate into a flowing fluid (air). So the naphthalene is sublimating into the air. The setup is a flat plate, so it's a boundary layer problem where the flow is over a flat plate.

I think I need to use the concept of the boundary layer and the similarity between momentum and concentration boundary layers. The average mass transfer coefficient can be found using the correlation for a flat plate in laminar flow, but I'm not sure if the flow is laminar or turbulent here.

Wait, the flow's Reynolds number will determine that. The Reynolds number Re is (velocity * length) / kinematic viscosity. But wait, I need to find the properties of air at 115°F. Let me convert that to Celsius because I'm more familiar with properties in SI units. 115°F is about 46.1°C.

I need the kinematic viscosity of air at 46°C. From memory, at around 20°C, kinematic viscosity is about 1.6e-4 ft²/s. At higher temperatures, it increases. Maybe around 1.7 or 1.8e-4 ft²/s? I'm not too sure, but let's say approximately 1.72e-4 ft²/s. I'll have to check that, but for now, I'll proceed.

So the length is 1.5 ft. Velocity is 16 ft/s. So Re = (16 ft/s * 1.5 ft) / (1.72e-4 ft²/s) = (24) / 1.72e-4 ≈ 139,500. Hmm, that's over 100,000, so the flow is probably turbulent. But wait, the critical Reynolds number for a flat plate is about 500,000, so maybe it's still in the transition region. But for calculation purposes, maybe the correlation I'll use will account for that.

Wait, but the problem is giving multiple-choice answers, so perhaps I can use standard correlations regardless of laminar or turbulent.

In mass transfer, the average mass transfer coefficient (k_L) can be found using the Chilton-Colburn analogy, which relates the mass transfer Stanton number to the friction factor. Alternatively, the correlation for the average mass transfer coefficient for a flat plate is:

k_L * Sc^(2/3) / (v) = 0.664 * Re_L^(1/2) 

Wait, no, let me think again. The average mass transfer coefficient for a flat plate in laminar flow is given by:

k_L = (v / x) * [ (0.664) * Re_x^(1/2) * Sc^(1/3) ) ]

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, the Sherwood number (Sh) is analogous to the Nusselt number. For a flat plate, the average Sherwood number up to length L is Sh_avg = (k_L * L) / D = 0.664 Re_L^(1/2) Sc^(1/3)

Wait, yes, that makes sense. Because Sh is kL/D, and Re is VL/v, Sc is v/D.

So Sh_avg = 0.664 Re_L^(1/2) Sc^(1/3)

But I need to know the Schmidt number (Sc) for naphthalene in air. What's the diffusivity of naphthalene in air? I remember that for many organic vapors in air, the diffusivity is around 0.05 to 0.1 ft²/s. Let me think—naphthalene has a higher molecular weight, so its diffusivity is lower. Maybe around 0.05 ft²/s at room temperature, but it's higher at 115°F. Wait, temperature affects diffusivity. The diffusivity increases with temperature.

At 46°C, perhaps D is around 0.07 ft²/s? Not sure. Alternatively, I can look for Schmidt number correlations. Alternatively, perhaps I can use Sc = v/D.

Wait, I think the Schmidt number for naphthalene in air is around 2.5 to 3. Let me see, for example, if the kinematic viscosity v is 1.72e-4 ft²/s, and D is 0.06 ft²/s, then Sc = v/D = 1.72e-4 / 0.06 ≈ 0.002866... wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait, units might be messed up. Wait no—D is in ft²/s, v is in ft²/s, so Sc is dimensionless. So if D is 0.06 ft²/s and v is 1.72e-4 ft²/s, then Sc = (1.72e-4) / (0.06) = approximately 0.002866. That's way too low. That can't be right. Hmm, perhaps I got D wrong.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of centimeters and seconds. Because sometimes diffusivity is given in cm²/s. Let me think again. Let me convert to cm units.

Wait, 1 ft = 30.48 cm. So 1 ft²/s = (30.48 cm)^2/s ≈ 928.9 cm²/s. Oh wait, that's way too big. So if D is 0.06 ft²/s, that's 0.06 * 928.9 = ~55.73 cm²/s, which is way too high because typical D for gases are around 0.1 to 1 cm²/s. So I must have messed up the units somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should express D in cm²/s. Let me think again. Let's say D for naphthalene in air is around 0.08 cm²/s at room temperature. But at higher temperatures, it's higher. Maybe 0.2 cm²/s at 115°F.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Maybe a better approach is to find the Schmidt number directly. I remember that for naphthalene in air, Sc is around 2.5. Let me check that.

Wait, no, another approach: the Schmidt number for naphthalene in air is around Sc = 2.5 at room temperature. But since temperature affects both v and D, perhaps the Sc remains similar if the temperature isn't too high. Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the exact value, but since I can't, I'll proceed with Sc ≈ 2.5.

Wait, but let me think again. The kinematic viscosity v of air at 46°C (115°F) is about 1.72e-4 ft²/s as I thought earlier. The diffusivity D for naphthalene in air: I think it's about 0.05 ft²/s. Wait, that can't be right because 0.05 ft²/s is 4.6e-4 m²/s, which is way too high. Wait, perhaps I should express D in m²/s, but I'm getting tangled in units.

Alternatively, perhaps using the Chapman-Enskog theory, but I'm not going to get into that. Maybe I should proceed with the assumption that Sc = 2.5. If that's incorrect, my answer will be off, but perhaps it's a starting point.

So, back to the average Sherwood number:

Sh_avg = 0.664 * Re_L^(1/2) * Sc^(1/3)

Re_L is (V * L) / v = (16 ft/s * 1.5 ft) / (1.72e-4 ft²/s) ≈ (24) / 1.72e-4 ≈ 139,500.

So Re_L ≈ 1.395e5. Since Re is over 1e5, it's in the turbulent region? Or perhaps the transition. Hmm, but the 0.664 coefficient is for laminar flow. So perhaps for a plate with length 1.5 ft, if Re is around 1.4e5, the flow is turbulent, so the correlation would be different.

Wait, for a flat plate, if the flow is entirely laminar, the correlation is Sh_avg = 0.664 Re_L^(1/2) Sc^(1/3). But if the flow is turbulent, the correlation changes.

Wait, but wait—the problem is probably assuming that the flow is laminar because the options don't seem to suggest a high Re. Alternatively, maybe the problem is using a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the local mass transfer coefficient, and the average is the integral.

Wait, but let me get back. The average mass transfer coefficient k_L is given by:

k_L = (Sh_avg * D) / L

Wait, no. Sh_avg is (k_L * L)/D, so k_L = Sh_avg * D / L.

Wait, that's correct. So if I compute Sh_avg using the laminar correlation, and then compute k_L, but if the flow is turbulent, perhaps a different correlation applies.

Wait, perhaps for a flat plate with turbulent flow, the average Sherwood number is given by:

Sh_avg = 0.037 Re_L^(4/5) Sc^(1/3) [for 1e5 < Re < 1e7]

But wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, the local Sherwood number in turbulent flow is Sh_x = 0.0296 Re_x^(4/5) Sc^(1/3).

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should proceed with the laminar flow assumption and see where that takes me, then adjust if needed.

So, Sh_avg = 0.664 * (139500)^(1/2) * (2.5)^(1/3)

Let me compute each part.

First, Re_L = 139500.

Re_L^(1/2) = sqrt(139500) ≈ 373.3.

Sc^(1/3) = (2.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.357.

So Sh_avg ≈ 0.664 * 373.3 * 1.357 ≈ Let's compute step by step.

0.664 * 373.3 = approx 0.664 * 373 = 247.8.

Then 247.8 * 1.357 ≈ 336.3.

So Sh_avg ≈ 336.3.

Then, k_L = Sh_avg * D / L.

Wait, D is the diffusivity. Earlier, I thought D might be around 0.06 ft²/s, but that led to a Sc of around 0.0028, which is way too low. So perhaps I made an error there.

Wait, let's compute Sc correctly. Sc = v / D.

v is 1.72e-4 ft²/s.

If Sc is around 2.5, then D = v / Sc = 1.72e-4 / 2.5 = 6.88e-5 ft²/s.

Wait, that makes more sense. So D = 6.88e-5 ft²/s.

So then, Sh_avg = 0.664 * Re_L^(1/2) * Sc^(1/3) ≈ 336.3.

Then, k_L = Sh_avg * D / L.

Wait, L is 1.5 ft.

So k_L = 336.3 * (6.88e-5 ft²/s) / 1.5 ft.

Compute numerator: 336.3 * 6.88e-5 = approx 336 * 0.0000688.

336 * 0.0000688 = let's compute 300 * 0.0000688 = 0.02064, 36 * 0.0000688 = 0.002473, so total ≈ 0.023113.

Then divide by 1.5: 0.023113 / 1.5 ≈ 0.015408 ft/s.

Wait, but wait, the units for k_L would be ft/s, since D is ft²/s, and L is ft, so Sh_avg is (ft/s * ft) / ft²/s → ft/s.

Wait, let me check the units:

Sh_avg = (k_L * L) / D → [k_L (ft/s) * L (ft)] / [D (ft²/s)] → (ft²/s) / (ft²/s) → dimensionless. So yes, correct.

So k_L = (Sh_avg * D) / L → (336.3 * 6.88e-5 ft²/s) / 1.5 ft → (2.311e-2 ft²/s) / 1.5 ft → ≈ 0.0154 ft/s.

Wait, 0.0154 ft/s is equal to 0.0154 * 3600 ft/hr = 55.44 ft/hr.

Looking at the options, option E has (a) 56.8, option J has (a)55, option I has 60.

Hmm, my approximate calculation gives around 55.4, which is close to option J (55) or E (56.8). Maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let's recalculate Sh_avg more accurately.

Re_L = 139,500.

Re_L^(1/2) = sqrt(139500) = let me compute sqrt(139500).

I know that 373^2 = 139,129. 374^2 = 139,876. So sqrt(139500) is approximately 373.3.

Sc = 2.5, so Sc^(1/3) = 2.5^(1/3) ≈ 1.3572.

So Sh_avg = 0.664 * 373.3 * 1.3572.

Compute 0.664 *373.3 first: 0.664 * 373 = 247.752.

Then multiply by 1.3572: 247.752 * 1.3572 ≈ Let's compute:

247.752 * 1 = 247.752

247.752 * 0.3 = 74.3256

247.752 * 0.05 = 12.3876

247.752 * 0.0072 ≈ 1.7858

Adding together: 247.752 + 74.3256 = 322.0776; +12.3876 = 334.4652; +1.7858 ≈ 336.251.

So Sh_avg ≈ 336.25.

Then, D was 6.88e-5 ft²/s, as computed earlier.

So k_L = (336.25 * 6.88e-5) / 1.5.

Compute numerator: 336.25 * 6.88e-5.

336 * 6.88e-5 = (300 * 6.88e-5) + (36 * 6.88e-5) = 0.02064 + 0.0024736 = 0.0231136.

0.25 * 6.88e-5 = 1.72e-5.

So total numerator ≈ 0.0231136 + 0.0000172 ≈ 0.0231308 ft²/s.

Then, 0.0231308 /1.5 ≈ 0.01542 ft/s.

Convert to ft/hr: 0.01542 ft/s * 3600 s/hr ≈ 55.512 ft/hr.

Hmm, so about 55.5 ft/hr. Looking at the options, option J is (a)55 ft/hr, option E is 56.8, option I is 60.

But perhaps my assumption of Sc=2.5 is incorrect. Maybe Sc is higher or lower. Let me think again.

If the actual Sc is higher, say 2.8, then Sc^(1/3) would be higher, leading to higher Sh and thus higher k_L.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute Sc more accurately. Let's try that.

First, compute the kinematic viscosity of air at 46°C (115°F). Let me refer to standard tables. At 20°C, v_air ≈ 1.516e-5 ft²/s. Wait no—wait, 1.516e-5 ft²/s is about 0.00001516 ft²/s. Wait, no, wait, 1 ft²/s is a huge unit. Wait, let's double-check the units.

Wait, 1 m²/s = 10.7639 ft²/s. So 1 cm²/s = 0.00107639 ft²/s.

At 20°C, v_air ≈ 1.516e-5 m²/s → 1.516e-5 * 10.7639 ≈ 0.000163 ft²/s.

Wait, that's 1.63e-4 ft²/s. So at 20°C, v is ~1.6e-4 ft²/s.

At 46°C, v increases. The viscosity of air increases with temperature. Using the formula for viscosity of air, which can be approximated as:

μ = 1.458e-5 * (T)^(3/2) / (T + 111) * 1e-4 lb_m/(ft·s)

Wait, perhaps I should use the Sutherland formula.

But maybe it's easier to look up the kinematic viscosity at 46°C.

Alternatively, I can use the fact that for air, the kinematic viscosity at 46°C is approximately 1.72e-4 ft²/s, as I initially thought. So v = 1.72e-4 ft²/s.

Now, for naphthalene in air, the diffusivity D can be found using D = (0.00143 * T^(2.3)) / M_w, where T is in K and M_w is molecular weight in g/mol. Wait, no, I think that's the Gilliland equation for estimating diffusion coefficients.

Wait, the formula I recall is D (in cm²/s) = (0.00143 * T^(2.3)) / M^(0.33) * (1 atm) / P, where P is pressure in atm.

Naphthalene's molecular weight is about 128.17 g/mol.

Temperature in K: 46
