Okay, so I've got this finance problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again. It says that at the beginning of each month, a deposit of $500 is made into an account that pays 8% compounded monthly. The question is asking what the final amount will be after five years. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I've heard about compound interest before, but this seems a bit more complex because it's not just a single deposit; it's a series of monthly deposits. Oh right, this is probably an annuity problem. Annuity calculations involve regular payments, and since the interest is compounded monthly, I think I'll need to use the future value of an ordinary annuity formula.

Wait, let me make sure. An ordinary annuity is one where the payments are made at the end of each period, but this problem says the deposit is made at the beginning of each month. Oh wait, no, wait—actually, the terminology can be a bit confusing. I remember that an annuity due is when payments are made at the beginning of the period. So this is an annuity due, not an ordinary annuity. That might change the formula I use.

But wait, sometimes people just use the same formula and adjust for the timing. Let me think. The standard future value of an ordinary annuity formula is FV = PMT * [(1 + r)^n - 1]/r, where PMT is the payment, r is the interest rate per period, and n is the number of periods.

Since this is an annuity due, each payment occurs one period earlier. So each $500 deposit earns interest for one more period than it would in an ordinary annuity. That means the future value for each payment is higher by a factor of (1 + r). So maybe the formula becomes FV = PMT * [(1 + r)^n - 1]/r * (1 + r). Wait, no, let me get this straight. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as each payment being made at the beginning, so the first payment will have n periods of growth, the next n-1, etc., but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, I've heard that the future value of an annuity due can be calculated by taking the future value of an ordinary annuity and multiplying by (1 + r). So FV = [PMT * ((1 + r)^n - 1)/r] * (1 + r). That makes sense because each payment is effectively one period earlier, so the whole annuity's future value is increased by (1 + r).

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me double-check. Oh, right, the formula for the future value of an annuity due is indeed FV = PMT * [(1 + r)^n - 1]/r * (1 + r). Or, alternatively, you can use FV = PMT * [(1 + r)^(n) - 1]/d, where d is the periodic discount rate, but I might be mixing things up.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to stick with the standard formula and adjust the number of periods. Let's see: the interest is compounded monthly, so the rate per period is 8% divided by 12. That makes the monthly rate r = 0.08 / 12.

The time period is five years, so the total number of months is 5 * 12 = 60 months. So n = 60.

Since it's an annuity due, each payment is at the beginning of the month, so the first $500 is deposited at month 0, and will earn interest for 60 months. The next deposit at month 1 will earn for 59 months, and so on, with the last deposit at month 59 (beginning of the 60th month) earning 0 months (but since it's the beginning, maybe it's just at the end, so maybe it's considered to be at time 0). Hmm, this might complicate the calculation.

Alternatively, using the formula for the future value of an annuity due: FV = PMT × [(1 + r)^n - 1]/r × (1 + r). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because the standard FV for annuity due is FV = PMT × [(1 + r)^n - 1]/r × (1 + r)^-1? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is FV = PMT × [(1 + r)^(n) - 1] / r × (1 + r). Let me verify this.

Alternatively, I've read that the future value of an annuity due can be found by taking the ordinary annuity's FV and multiplying by (1 + r). So FV_due = FV_ordinary * (1 + r).

Wait, let's think: For an ordinary annuity, the first payment is at the end of the first period, so it earns (n-1) periods of interest. For an annuity due, the first payment is at the beginning, so it earns n periods. So each payment in the annuity due is made one period earlier, so the FV is higher by a factor of (1 + r).

So if FV_ordinary is the value calculated with the standard formula, then FV_due = FV_ordinary × (1 + r). So that makes sense.

Let me try calculating that. So, PMT is $500. r is 0.08/12, which is approximately 0.00666667. n is 60 months.

First, compute FV_ordinary: FV = 500 * [ (1 + 0.00666667)^60 - 1 ] / 0.00666667.

Let me compute (1 + 0.00666667)^60. Hmm, that's the same as (1 + 0.08/12)^60, which is (1.00666667)^60. I can compute this using the formula for compound interest. Alternatively, I can approximate it, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of the future value factor.

The term (1 + r)^n is equal to (1.00666667)^60. Let me compute that. Let me see, 0.00666667 is 1/150, so 1 + 1/150 is 151/150. Raising that to the 60th power.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it step by step. Wait, maybe using the rule of 72 or another approximation, but perhaps I should be precise here.

Wait, 8% annual rate, compounded monthly. The effective annual rate would be (1 + 0.08/12)^12 - 1, but I'm not sure if that's necessary here.

Wait, but for the FV_ordinary calculation, I can compute it as 500 * [ (1.00666667)^60 - 1 ] / 0.00666667.

Let me compute (1.00666667)^60 first. Let me use logarithms or perhaps a better approach. Alternatively, I can use the formula for compound interest.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute this step by step. Let's see: 1.00666667^60.

Wait, if I take natural logs: ln(1.00666667) ≈ 0.006645, so ln(1.00666667)^60 is 60 * 0.006645 ≈ 0.3987. Exponentiating that gives e^0.3987 ≈ 1.488. So (1.00666667)^60 ≈ 1.488. So then [ (1.00666667)^60 - 1 ] ≈ 0.488.

Then, the denominator is 0.00666667, so [0.488] / 0.00666667 ≈ 73.125.

So FV_ordinary ≈ 500 * 73.125 = 36,562.50.

But wait, that's for an ordinary annuity. Since this is an annuity due, we need to multiply by (1 + r), which is 1.00666667.

So FV_due = 36,562.50 * 1.00666667 ≈ 36,562.50 * 1.00666667.

Let me compute that: 36,562.50 * 0.00666667 is approximately 243.75, so adding that gives 36,562.50 + 243.75 = 36,806.25.

Wait, but wait a minute. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approximation. Because when I approximated (1.00666667)^60 as 1.488, that might not be precise. Let me check with a calculator method.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the exact value using the formula.

Wait, perhaps I can compute (1 + 0.08/12)^60 more accurately. 0.08/12 is 0.0066666667.

So (1.0066666667)^60. Let's compute it:

We can use the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

Here, P is 1, r is 0.08, n is 12, t is 5. So A = (1 + 0.08/12)^(12*5) = (1.006666667)^60.

But wait, that's the same as (1.006666667)^60, which is approximately equal to e^(0.08*5) when n is large, but for n=12, it's a bit less. But perhaps using a calculator, I can get a more precise value.

Alternatively, perhaps using the rule that (1 + r)^n ≈ e^(rn) when r is small. But 0.00666667 is small, but for n=60, it's 0.4, so e^0.4 ≈ 1.4918. Hmm, which is close to my initial approximation of 1.488.

Wait, but perhaps using a calculator, let's compute it more accurately. Let's compute 1.00666667^60.

Let me compute step by step:

First, compute 1.00666667^12 to get the annual factor.

1.00666667^12: Let's compute that. 1.00666667^2 ≈ 1.01337778. Then, 1.01337778^6: let's compute that.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute 1.00666667^60 using logarithms.

Compute ln(1.00666667) = approximately 0.0066445.

Multiply by 60: 0.0066445 * 60 = 0.39867.

Exponentiate: e^0.39867 ≈ 1.4883.

So (1.00666667)^60 ≈ 1.4883.

So back to the FV_ordinary: PMT * ( (1.00666667)^60 - 1 ) / 0.00666667.

Which is 500 * (1.4883 - 1) / 0.00666667.

So (0.4883) / 0.00666667 = approximately 73.2.

Then 500 * 73.2 = 36,600.

Wait, earlier I had 36,562.50, but maybe due to approximation. Let's say approximately 36,600.

Now, since it's an annuity due, FV_due = FV_ordinary * (1 + r) = 36,600 * 1.00666667 ≈ 36,600 * 1.00666667.

Compute 36,600 * 0.00666667 ≈ 244. So 36,600 + 244 ≈ 36,844.

So FV_due ≈ $36,844.

But looking at the options given, I don't see that exact number. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: 39,000.00

B: 40,500.00

C: 33,000.00

D: 35,000.00

E: 36,983.35

F: 40,000.00

G: 31,000.00

H: 34,500.00

I: 42,000.00

J: 38,500.00

Hmm, so my approximate calculation gave me around $36,844, which is closest to option E: 36,983.35. But wait, perhaps my approximation was a bit off because I used an approximate value for (1.00666667)^60.

Alternatively, let me compute it more accurately. Let me compute (1.00666667)^60 exactly.

Using a calculator approach: 1.00666667^60.

I know that 1.00666667 is 1 + 1/150. So (151/150)^60.

But perhaps a better way is to use the formula for compound interest with more precise calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps using the future value formula for an annuity due, which is:

FV = PMT × [(1 + r)^n - 1] / r × (1 + r)

Wait no, that can't be right because that would be FV_ordinary multiplied by (1 + r), which is what I did before.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is FV = PMT × [ ((1 + r)^n - 1) / r ] × (1 + r). Wait, no, that would be (FV_ordinary) × (1 + r), which is correct for annuity due.

So FV_ordinary is PMT * [ (1 + r)^n - 1 ] / r.

Then FV_due = FV_ordinary * (1 + r).

Wait, but another way to write the formula is FV = PMT × [(1 + r)^n - 1] / d, where d is the discount rate, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula specific for annuity due:

FV = PMT × [(1 + r)^n - 1] / r × (1 + r)^-1 ? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look up the formula for future value of an annuity due.

Wait, the formula for the future value of an annuity due is:

FV = PMT × [ (1 + r)^(n) - 1 ] / r × (1 + r)

Wait, no, that can't be, because that would be (FV_ordinary) * (1 + r), which is what I had before.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think differently. Maybe I can compute each payment's future value individually and sum them up.

Each payment of $500 is made at the beginning of each month, so the first payment is at time 0, the next at time 1, etc., up to time 59 (since 5 years = 60 months, but starting at 0, the last payment is at 59, which is the 60th payment).

So the future value of each payment would be 500*(1 + r)^k, where k is the number of periods after the payment is made.

So for the first payment (time 0), it's 500*(1 + r)^60.

The second payment (time 1): 500*(1 + r)^59.

...

The last payment (time 59): 500*(1 + r)^1.

So the total FV is 500 * [ (1 + r)^60 + (1 + r)^59 + ... + (1 + r)^1 ].

This is a geometric series with first term a = (1 + r), ratio = (1 + r), number of terms = 60.

The sum of this series is (1 + r) * [ ( (1 + r)^60 - 1 ) / r ].

So FV = 500 * (1 + r) * [ ( (1 + r)^60 - 1 ) / r ].

Which is FV = 500 * [ ( (1 + r)^61 - (1 + r) ) / r ].

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me go back.

Alternatively, the sum S = (1 + r)^1 + (1 + r)^2 + ... + (1 + r)^60.

This is a geometric series where each term is (1 + r)^n from n=1 to n=60.

The sum S can be written as (1 + r) * [ (1 + r)^60 - 1 ] / r.

So S = (1 + r) * [ (1 + r)^60 - 1 ] / r.

Therefore, FV = 500 * S = 500 * (1 + r) * [ (1 + r)^60 - 1 ] / r.

Which is 500 * (1 + r) * [ (1.00666667)^60 - 1 ] / 0.00666667.

Now, let's compute this more accurately.

First, compute (1.00666667)^60. Let me get the exact value using a calculator. I'll use an online calculator for this.

Using a calculator, (1 + 0.08/12)^60 = (1.00666667)^60 ≈ 1.489856.

So, (1.00666667)^60 ≈ 1.489856.

Then, [ (1.00666667)^60 - 1 ] = 0.489856.

Multiply by (1 + r) = 1.00666667: 0.489856 * 1.00666667 ≈ 0.493082.

Now, divide by r = 0.00666667: 0.493082 / 0.00666667 ≈ 73.9123.

Multiply by PMT = 500: 500 * 73.9123 ≈ 36,956.15.

Hmm, which is approximately $36,956.15.

Looking at the options, option E is $36,983.35, which is very close to this. So perhaps with more precise calculation, it would be exactly that.

Wait, perhaps the approximation of (1.00666667)^60 was a bit off. Let me compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for compound interest again.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact future value can be calculated using the formula FV = PMT * ((1 + r)^n - 1) / r * (1 + r), which is the same as what I did before.

Wait, in any case, my calculation is giving me approximately $36,956, which is very close to option E, which is $36,983.35.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (1.00666667)^60 more accurately.

Let me compute it step by step:

Compute (1.00666667)^60.

We can compute this using the formula for exponents, perhaps using the binomial expansion, but that's
