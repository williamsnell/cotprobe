Okay, so I've got this question about logic gates and universal gates. Hmm, let's think. I remember that universal gates are the ones that can be used to create any other logic gate. But wait, which ones are those exactly?

I think NAND and NOR are the main universal gates. Because I remember that both NAND and NOR are functionally complete, meaning you can build any gate with just them. So any set that includes either of these as the primary gates might be the answer.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: XOR, XNOR, NOR. Wait, XOR isn't a universal gate by itself. Because I think you can't make all gates with just XOR. But wait, maybe when combined with others? But I think that's not right because I remember that only NAND and NOR are the universal ones. So this might not be correct.

Option B: OR, NOT, AND. Well, these are basic gates. But are they universal? I don't think so. Because to be universal, you need a functionally complete set. I think OR and AND alone aren't enough without NOT. Oh wait, but when you have AND, OR, and NOT, that's a complete set. So is this option correct? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Because I remember that NAND and NOR are the universal gates, but another thought comes in: the combination of NOT, AND, OR can make any gate. Or maybe that's not the case. Wait, no, because I think that if you have NOT, AND, and OR, you can make any gate, but they are not considered the universal gates. Universal gates are those individual gates that alone can create all others. Wait, no, actually, the term "universal" sometimes refers to a set of gates that together can form any circuit. So I'm getting a bit confused here.

Option C: NOR, NAND, XNOR. Hmm, but do we need all of them? I think just having NOR or NAND is enough. So this set includes more than necessary. But the question is about which set is designated as universal. So maybe this isn't the right option.

Option D: AND, OR. I don't think these two can create all gates. Because without NOT, you can't invert signals. So I don't think this is correct.

Option E: OR, XOR, NOT. Again, OR and XOR might not cover all possibilities. Plus, I don't think XOR is a universal gate. So probably not.

Option F: XOR, XNOR. Definitely not. These are for exclusive or and its inverse, but they can't make all gates.

Option G: AND, OR, NOT, NAND. Hmm, this includes several gates. But I think any of the universal sets would include either NAND or NOR. So this might not be the best choice.

Option H: NOT, AND, NAND. Well, NOT and AND, but maybe NAND alone is enough. Or is it? Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to remember: The NAND gate alone is universal because you can create any other gate using just NAND. Similarly, NOR is also universal. So a set that includes either NAND or NOR would be correct.

Looking at the options, which sets include these? Let's see.

Option J: NOR, NAND. So this set includes both. But I thought that each of them alone is sufficient. So if the question is about which set is designated as universal, then any set that includes either is correct. But wait, the options might have a set that includes both, but I'm not sure if that's necessary. Alternatively, the question might be looking for the individual gates that are universal. But the options are sets, so perhaps the correct ones are those that include either NAND or NOR.

Wait, the question asks which set of logic gates are designated as universal. So a set like {NAND} is universal, but none of the options have just NAND. Similarly, a set with {NOR} alone is also universal, but does any option have that?

Looking again:

Option J: NOR, NAND. Well, both are universal on their own. So this set definitely includes universal gates. But is this the correct answer, or is the question looking for a set that is a minimal universal set?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is either the set containing just NAND or just NOR. But looking at the options, none of them have only NAND or only NOR. The closest is option J which includes both.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. I think each of NAND and NOR is a universal gate on its own. So any set that includes either would be correct. But the question is about sets of gates designated as universal. So the correct sets would be those that include either NAND or NOR.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

Option J: NOR, NAND.

So this set includes both universal gates. But perhaps the correct answer is a set that includes either, but maybe the question is looking for the minimal sets. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that both NAND and NOR are universal gates.

Wait, the question is phrased as "sets of logic gates are designated as universal gates." So which of these options are considered as universal sets.

Wait, the term "universal gates" might refer to individual gates. So if the question is asking which set includes any of the universal gates, then both NAND and NOR are universal, so a set including either would be correct.

Looking at the options, the correct sets would be those that include NAND or NOR. So let's check all options.

Option A: includes NOR, but also XOR and XNOR. Hmm, I think that's more than needed, but NOR is a universal gate. So this set includes a universal gate, so this could be a correct option.

Wait, but the question is, which of these sets are designated as universal gates. So perhaps it's looking for the set which is known as the universal set. For example, the set {NAND} is a universal gate, but none of the options have that. The set {NOR} is another, but again, option J has both.

Alternatively, the correct answer is J because it includes both NAND and NOR, which are both universal.

Wait, another approach: I remember that the standard universal gates are NAND and NOR. So any set that includes either of them is a universal set. But the question is about which set is designated as universal.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that both NAND and NOR are universal, so a set that includes either would be correct. But the question provides options, and I need to pick which one is correct.

Looking at the options, option J includes both NAND and NOR. But perhaps the correct answer is that each of these is a universal gate, so the set that includes either would be correct.

But looking at the options, which ones include at least one universal gate.

Option J includes both, so that would be a correct set. But I'm not sure if the question is looking for a specific combination.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option J: NOR, NAND.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Another way: which options are universal sets. A universal set is a set of gates that can create any other gate.

So, for instance:

- The set {NAND} is universal.

- The set {NOR} is universal.

- The set {NOT, AND, OR} is universal.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the combination of NOT, AND, and OR is universal, but individually they are not. So in that case, option B (OR, NOT, AND) would be a universal set because together they can form any gate. So if that's the case, then option B is a correct answer.

Wait, but the question is about which sets are designated as universal gates. I'm a bit confused because I thought that NAND and NOR are the universal gates individually, but perhaps the term 'universal set' refers to a set of gates that together can form any gate.

Wait, maybe I should clarify the definitions. A universal gate is a gate that can implement any other gate. So NAND and NOR are universal gates because you can build any circuit with just NAND or just NOR.

But sometimes, a universal set refers to a set of gates that, when used together, can form any circuit. In that case, the set {AND, OR, NOT} is a universal set because together they can create any gate.

So if the question is about sets that form universal sets (i.e., functionally complete sets), then option B (OR, NOT, AND) would be a correct answer because those three are sufficient to create any gate.

But wait, I thought that NAND and NOR are universal on their own, so any set that includes them would be a universal set. So let's reevaluate.

The question is: which of these sets are designated as universal gates?

If the question is about the individual gates being universal, then a set that includes NAND or NOR would be correct. But if it's about the set being a universal set (i.e., together the gates in the set can create any function), then sets including NAND or NOR would qualify, as would option B.

Wait, but the options include J as (NOR, NAND), which includes both. So that's definitely a universal set.

Alternatively, option B is (OR, NOT, AND), which is another universal set.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the terms. Let me think again.

The term "universal gate" typically refers to a single gate that can be used to construct any other gate. So NAND and NOR are universal gates because each alone can create any circuit.

However, the term "functionally complete set" refers to a set of gates that together can create any circuit. So for example, {NAND} is a functionally complete set, as is {NOR}, and also {AND, OR, NOT}.

So the question is about which sets are designated as universal gates. Wait, maybe the question is using "universal gates" to mean that the set is a universal set, i.e., functionally complete.

So looking at the options, the functionally complete sets would be those that include NAND or NOR, or include AND, OR, NOT.

So let's look at each option:

Option A: XOR, XNOR, NOR. Well, NOR is a universal gate, so this set is functionally complete.

Option B: OR, NOT, AND. This is a functionally complete set.

Option C: NOR, NAND, XNOR. Both NOR and NAND are universal, so this set is functionally complete.

Option D: AND, OR. Not functionally complete, because you can't create NOT without something else.

Option E: OR, XOR, NOT. Hmm, OR and NOT can create NOR, which would make this functionally complete. Wait, because with OR and NOT, you can make AND (De Morgan's laws: NOT(A OR B) = NOT A AND NOT B. So if you have NOT and OR, you can create AND as well. Wait, let's see. If you have OR and NOT, can you create AND? Let me think. Suppose I have A OR B, and invert each input: NOT A and NOT B. Then, if I have a way to AND them, but without an AND gate, how? Wait, no, because to create AND, you might need to combine OR with NOTs. Alternatively, maybe the set {OR, NOT} is sufficient. Because with OR and NOT, you can create AND and NAND. Wait, no. Let me think: If you have A and B, to create A AND B, you can invert the result of NOT A AND NOT B using De Morgan's law. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Perhaps it's better to remember that the set {OR, NOT} isn't functionally complete, but {OR, NOT, AND} is.

Wait, maybe I should refer to known functionally complete sets. The standard ones are:

1. {NAND}
2. {NOR}
3. {AND, OR, NOT}
4. {AND, NOT, OR} (same as above)
5. {XOR, AND, OR} isn't functionally complete, I think.

So, any set that includes either NAND or NOR is functionally complete. Also, the set {AND, OR, NOT} is functionally complete.

So looking at the options:

Option B: OR, NOT, AND → functionally complete → yes.

Option J: NOR, NAND → each is universal, so any combination including them is functionally complete.

So both option B and J are functionally complete.

Wait, but the question is asking which sets are designated as universal gates. So perhaps the answer is B and J. But looking at the options, the question provides single-choice answers, so I must choose which one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is specifically about which individual gates are considered universal, and the options are sets that include those. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option J: NOR, NAND, because both are universal gates, and the set is designated as universal.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: I think that the standard answer to this question is that NAND and NOR are the universal gates. So any set that includes either would be correct. But looking at the options, option J includes both, so that's a valid set. Option B is another valid set because it includes AND, OR, NOT.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "sets of logic gates are designated as universal gates." So perhaps it's referring to the individual gates in the set. So each gate in the set is a universal gate.

In that case, which sets consist of universal gates? Because NAND and NOR are universal.

So option J includes two universal gates, so that's correct.

Option I: XOR, NOR, NAND. XOR isn't a universal gate, so this set isn't correct.

So the correct answer would be option J.

To determine which sets of logic gates are designated as universal gates, it is important to understand that universal gates are those that can be used to construct any other logic gate. Historically, NAND and NOR are recognized as universal gates because each alone can create any circuit. Additionally, a set of gates is considered functionally complete if, together, they can create any logic gate. Known functionally complete sets include:

1. **{NAND}**: Universally complete on its own.  
2. **{NOR}**: Universally complete on its own.  
3. **{AND, OR, NOT}**: Together, these gates can create any logic gate.  

Analyzing the options:  

- **Option A (XOR, XNOR, NOR)**: NOR is a universal gate, so this set is functionally complete.  
- **Option B (OR, NOT, AND)**: This set is functionally complete because together, these gates can create any logic gate.  
- **Option C (NOR, NAND, XNOR)**: Both NOR and NAND are universal gates, making this set functionally complete.  
- **Option D (AND, OR)**: This set is not functionally complete, as it lacks the ability to create NOT.  
- **Option E (OR, XOR, NOT)**: This set is not functionally complete, as it cannot create AND or NAND directly.  
- **Option F (XOR, XNOR)**: This set is not functionally complete, as it cannot create NOT or AND.  
- **Option G (AND, OR, NOT, NAND)**: This set is functionally complete, as it includes AND, OR, and NOT, which together can create any gate.  
- **Option H (NOT, AND, NAND)**: This set is functionally complete, as it includes NOT, AND, and NAND, which together can create any gate.  
- **Option I (XOR, NOR, NAND)**: This set is functionally complete because it includes NOR and NAND, which are universal gates.  
- **Option J (NOR, NAND)**: This set is functionally complete because both NOR and NAND are universal gates.  

The question asks for sets of logic gates that are designated as universal gates. Since NAND and NOR are individually universal, any set containing either or both is correct. Among the options, **Option J (NOR, NAND)** is the most straightforward and universally recognized answer, as it explicitly includes both universal gates.
