Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about lenses. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my optics, but let me try to think this through.

Alright, the problem says that an object is placed 20 inches from a lens, and the virtual image is formed 10 inches from the lens. I need to determine the focal length and whether the lens is converging or diverging.

Wait, I remember the lens formula is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di. Right, where do is the object distance, di is the image distance, and f is the focal length. But wait, I have to be careful with the signs here. Oh yeah, in optics, the sign conventions matter a lot.

So, if the image is virtual, where does that place it? I think for lenses, if the image is virtual, the image distance is negative. Because, in the case of a diverging lens, images are always virtual, right? And for converging lenses, if the object is within the focal length, the image is virtual as well. So the image distance di would be negative.

Wait, the problem says the image is virtual and formed 10 inches from the lens. So di is -10 inches. The object distance do is 20 inches because the object is placed 20 inches from the lens.

Let me plug these into the lens formula. So 1/f = 1/do + 1/di. Substituting the values:

1/f = (1/20) + (1/(-10)).

Wait, let me compute that. So 1/20 is 0.05, and 1/(-10) is -0.1. Adding them together: 0.05 - 0.1 = -0.05. So 1/f is -0.05, which means f is -20 inches.

Wait, that's a negative focal length. Oh right, because for lenses, the sign of the focal length tells us if it's converging or diverging. A positive f is converging, and negative is diverging. So if f is -20 inches, that means it's a diverging lens.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option A is -20in, diverging. Oh yes, that's what I got. So the answer should be option A.

But wait, let me double-check. Did I get the signs right? Object distance is positive because it's on the same side as the incoming light. Image is virtual, so di is negative. Yeah, that's correct. So 1/f = 1/20 - 1/10. Wait, that would be 1/20 minus 1/10? Or is it 1/20 + (-1/10)?

Oh wait, no. The formula is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di. So 1/do is 1/20, and 1/di is 1/(-10). So 1/20 - 1/10 = (1 -2)/20 = -1/20. So 1/f is -1/20, so f is -20 inches. Yep, that's correct.

So the lens is diverging with a focal length of -20 inches. So option A is correct.

To solve the problem, we use the lens formula:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}
\]

where \( d_o \) is the object distance, \( d_i \) is the image distance, and \( f \) is the focal length. The problem states that the object is placed 20 inches from the lens (\( d_o = 20 \, \text{in} \)) and the virtual image is formed 10 inches from the lens (\( d_i = -10 \, \text{in} \)) since virtual images have negative image distances.

Substituting the values into the formula:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{20} + \frac{1}{-10}
\]

Simplify:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = 0.05 - 0.1 = -0.05
\]

Thus:

\[
f = \frac{1}{-0.05} = -20 \, \text{in}
\]

The negative focal length indicates that the lens is diverging. Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**A: -20in, diverging**
