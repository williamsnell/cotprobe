Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about determining whether a given argument is valid using indirect truth tables. If it's invalid, I need to pick a counterexample from the options provided.

The argument is:

(A ∨ B) ⊃ C
C ⊃ ~D
-------
D ⊃ A

So, the premises are (A or B) implies C, and C implies not D. The conclusion is D implies A. I need to check if this argument is valid.

I remember that an argument is valid if whenever all the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. If I can find any situation where the premises are all true, but the conclusion is false, then the argument is invalid. That situation would be a counterexample.

Since the question mentions using indirect truth tables, I think that method involves assuming the premises are true and the conclusion is false, and then seeing if that's possible.

Let me outline what I need to do:

1. Assume all premises are true.
2. Assume the conclusion is false.
3. See if there's a consistent assignment of truth values to A, B, C, D that satisfies these conditions.

If such an assignment exists, the argument is invalid, and that assignment is a counterexample.

So, let's break it down.

First, the premises:

1. (A ∨ B) → C. The implication is equivalent to ~ (A ∨ B) ∨ C, which is also equivalent to (~A ∧ ~B) ∨ C.
2. C → ~D. Which is equivalent to ~C ∨ ~D.

The conclusion is D → A, which is equivalent to ~D ∨ A.

We want to see if we can have the premises true and the conclusion false.

The conclusion D→A is false only when D is true and A is false. So, for the conclusion to be false, D must be true and A must be false.

So, let's assume:

- A is false (since D→A is false only when D is true and A is false)
- D is true.

Now, let's see what this implies for the premises.

Starting with the second premise: C → ~D. Since D is true, ~D is false. So, for the implication C→~D to hold, C must be false. Because in an implication, if the consequent is false, the antecedent must be false for the implication to be true.

So, C must be false.

Now, let's look at the first premise: (A ∨ B) → C. We know that C is false. So, for this implication to hold, the antecedent (A ∨ B) must be false. Because if the antecedent is false, the implication is automatically true, regardless of C.

So, (A ∨ B) must be false. That means both A is false and B is false.

Wait, but earlier I set A to be false. So, B must also be false here.

So, putting it all together:

- A is false
- B is false
- C is false
- D is true

Now, let's check if all these assignments make the premises true.

First premise: (A ∨ B) → C.

A is false, B is false, so A ∨ B is false. The implication is false → false, which is true.

Second premise: C → ~D.

C is false, so the implication is false → (something). Since implications are true when the antecedent is false, this premise is true.

Conclusion: D → A. D is true, A is false, so the implication is false.

So, in this scenario, both premises are true, but the conclusion is false. That means the argument is invalid, and we have a counterexample where A and B are false, C is false, and D is true.

Now, I need to look at the options provided and find which one matches this scenario.

Looking at the options:

Option G says: Invalid. Counterexample when D is true, A, B, and C are false.

Yes, that's exactly the scenario I found. So, the correct answer would be option G.
</think>

To determine the validity of the argument, we analyze whether the conclusion \( D \rightarrow A \) necessarily follows from the premises \( (A \lor B) \rightarrow C \) and \( C \rightarrow \neg D \). An argument is valid if, in all scenarios where the premises are true, the conclusion is also true. If a counterexample exists where the premises are true but the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid.

### Step 1: Assume the conclusion is false
The conclusion \( D \rightarrow A \) is false only when \( D \) is true and \( A \) is false.

### Step 2: Analyze the second premise \( C \rightarrow \neg D \)
Since \( D \) is true, \( \neg D \) is false. For the implication \( C \rightarrow \neg D \) to hold, \( C \) must be false (as an implication with a false consequent requires a false antecedent).

### Step 3: Analyze the first premise \( (A \lor B) \rightarrow C \)
Since \( C \) is false, the antecedent \( A \lor B \) must also be false for the implication to hold. This means both \( A \) and \( B \) must be false.

### Step 4: Assign truth values
From the above analysis, the truth assignments are:
- \( A \) is false
- \( B \) is false
- \( C \) is false
- \( D \) is true

### Step 5: Verify the premises and conclusion
1. First premise: \( (A \lor B) \rightarrow C \). Since \( A \) and \( B \) are both false, \( A \lor B \) is false. The implication \( \text{false} \rightarrow \text{false} \) is true.
2. Second premise: \( C \rightarrow \neg D \). Since \( C \) is false, the implication \( \text{false} \rightarrow \text{false} \) is true.
3. Conclusion: \( D \rightarrow A \). Since \( D \) is true and \( A \) is false, the implication is false.

### Conclusion
The premises are true, but the conclusion is false under the assignment \( A = \text{false}, B = \text{false}, C = \text{false}, D = \text{true} \). This constitutes a counterexample, proving the argument is invalid.

### Final Answer
The correct option is **G: Invalid. Counterexample when D is true, A, B, and C are false.**
