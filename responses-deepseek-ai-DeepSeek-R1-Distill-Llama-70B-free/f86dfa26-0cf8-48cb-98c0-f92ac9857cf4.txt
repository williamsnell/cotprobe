Okay, so I have to figure out the symbol for antimony. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry symbols, but I'll try to think this through. Let me start by recalling what I know about elements and their symbols.

Antimony, I remember, is a chemical element. I think it's one of those elements whose symbol comes from Latin. Oh right, a lot of element symbols are derived from their Latin names. So what's the Latin name for antimony?

Wait, I think the Latin word for antimony is "stibium." Yes, that sounds right. So the symbol would be derived from that. Usually, the symbol is the first one or two letters of the Latin name. Like gold is aurum, so Au. Silver is argentum, so Ag. So applying that logic, stibium would probably take the first two letters, which are S and I. So Sb?

Let me double-check. I remember seeing Sb somewhere in the periodic table. Antimony is in group 15, I think. Or was it group 14? Oh wait, group 15 is nitrogen group, right? So maybe group 14 is the carbon group, which includes elements like silicon, germanium, and maybe antimony is further down. Wait, no, antimony is actually in the same group as arsenic and phosphorus. So yeah, group 15.

But back to the symbol. So if the Latin name is stibium, the symbol would be Sb. Let me think of other elements. Like lead is Pb from plumbum, tin is Sn from stannum. So yes, that makes sense.

Looking at the options, I see option J is Sb. So the answer should be J.

The symbol for antimony is derived from its Latin name, "stibium." The first two letters, "S" and "b," form the symbol Sb. Among the given options, Sb corresponds to option J.
