Okay, so I need to solve this insurance problem. Let me try to understand what's going on here. Mr. Singer has his house insured for $36,000, and the policy has an 80% coinsurance clause. The house is valued at $45,000, and he had a fire loss of $10,500. I need to find out how much the insurance company will pay.

Hmm, I remember that coinsurance clauses require the policyholder to insure the property for a certain percentage of its value. If they don't, the insurance company might only pay a portion of the loss. So the key here is the 80% coinsurance. Let's think about that.

First, I think I need to check if the insured amount meets the coinsurance requirement. The coinsurance clause usually states that the insured must cover at least a certain percentage (in this case, 80%) of the property's value. Otherwise, the payout is reduced.

So, the house is worth $45,000. 80% of that would be 0.8 * 45,000. Let me calculate that. 45,000 times 0.8 is 36,000. Oh, wait, that's exactly the amount Mr. Singer insured it for—$36,000. So he met the 80% requirement. That's good because it means the insurance company will cover the loss up to the policy's coverage, without any coinsurance penalty, I think.

Wait, no, wait a second. I'm a bit confused. The policy has an 80% coinsurance clause, which means the insured must have coverage equal to at least 80% of the property's value. Since he has exactly that, his coverage is adequate, so he won't be subject to any penalty. So the insurance company should pay the full amount of the loss up to the policy limits, but wait, the policy is for $36,000, but the loss is $10,500.

Wait, no, perhaps the coinsurance works differently. Let me think again. The standard coinsurance formula is: if the insured amount is equal to or greater than 80% of the property value, then the insurance company pays the full loss (up to the policy limit). But if the insured amount is less than 80%, then the company pays only a proportion of the loss.

But in this case, the insured amount is $36,000, which is exactly 80% of $45,000. So he's meeting the requirement. Therefore, the insurance company will cover the loss as per the policy.

But wait, the policy's maximum payout is the insured amount, but the loss is only $10,500. So the insurance company should pay the lesser of the policy's coverage or the actual loss, but perhaps coinsurance affects that.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. The coinsurance clause affects how much the insurance company pays relative to the loss when the insured amount is less than the required percentage. Since he's exactly at 80%, the coinsurance doesn't impose a penalty here. So the company will pay the full loss, up to the policy's coverage, but wait, the policy is for $36,000. The loss is $10,500, which is less than $36,000, so the company would pay the full $10,500, right?

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is $10,500. But I'm a bit unsure because I'm not considering whether the coinsurance affects this. Let's double-check.

The formula for coinsurance is: (Amount of Insurance / (Value of Property * Coinsurance Percentage)) * Loss.

Wait, when the insured amount is less than the required coinsurance, the payout is (insurance amount / (value * coinsurance)) * loss. But when it's equal or more, it's just the loss or the policy limit, whichever is lower.

So in this case, since 36,000 >= (45,000 * 0.8) which is 36,000, so it's equal. So the payout is the minimum of the loss and the policy limit.

The loss is 10,500, which is less than 36,000, so the company pays 10,500. So the answer would be E.

But wait, I'm looking at the options and E is 10,500. But I want to make sure I'm not missing something. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate it using the coinsurance formula.

Wait, another way: the coinsurance formula is Insurance Paid = (Insured Amount / (Value * Coinsurance)) * Loss, but only if Insured Amount is less than (Value * Coinsurance). If it's equal or greater, then Insurance Paid is the lesser of the loss or the insured amount.

So in this case, since 36,000 equals 45,000 * 0.8, the insurance pays the loss, which is 10,500, so E is correct.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes the coinsurance is applied as the insurance company paying a proportion of the loss based on the ratio of insured amount to the value times coinsurance. So if the insured amount is sufficient, the ratio is 1, so they pay 100% of the loss up to the policy limit.

Wait, let me think again. The coinsurance clause requires that the policyholder insures the property to at least 80% of its value. If he does that, the insurance company will pay the full loss (up to the policy limit). If he doesn't, the company will only pay proportionally.

In this case, he has met the 80% requirement because 36,000 is 80% of 45,000. So the company will pay the full amount of the loss, which is 10,500. Therefore, the answer should be option E.

Wait, but I'm looking at the options again, and I see option B is 9,000. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the coinsurance clause. Maybe the coinsurance is 80%, meaning the insured pays 20% of the loss. No, that's not right. Coinsurance typically refers to the sharing of loss between the insured and the insurer beyond the deductible, but perhaps in property insurance, it's different.

Alternatively, perhaps the coinsurance works by the insurance company paying 80% of the loss. But that doesn't make sense with the standard clauses I've heard of.

Wait, perhaps the coinsurance clause in this context is that the policyholder must have insurance equal to at least 80% of the value. If not, the payout is reduced. So in this case, since he has exactly 80%, he's okay, and the insurance company pays 80% of the loss. Wait, that would be 10,500 * 0.8 = 8,400, which is option C.

Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier thought. Hmm. Now I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think I need to clarify this. The coinsurance clause in property insurance typically works as follows: the policyholder agrees to carry insurance equal to a certain percentage (like 80%) of the property's value. If they do, the insurer will pay the full amount of the loss up to the policy limit. If they don't, the insurer will only pay a proportion of the loss, calculated by the ratio of the amount of insurance to the required amount (80% of value).

So in this case, the required amount is 80% of 45,000, which is 36,000. The insured amount is exactly 36,000, so the ratio is 36,000 / 36,000 = 1. Therefore, the insurer will pay 100% of the loss up to the policy limit.

The loss is 10,500, which is less than the policy limit of 36,000. So the insurer pays 10,500, which is option E.

Wait, but that can't be right because some sources I remember indicate that coinsurance affects the payout based on the ratio even when the insured amount is sufficient. Or perhaps I'm mixing it up with other types of insurance.

Alternatively, perhaps the coinsurance clause in this case means that the insurance company covers 80% of the loss, and the policyholder covers 20%. So the payment would be 10,500 * 0.8 = 8,400, which is option C.

But that would be a different interpretation. So now I'm really confused about which approach is correct.

Wait, let's try to find the correct approach. Let me think of a standard example. Suppose the value is $100,000, 80% coinsurance, and the insured amount is $80,000. If there's a loss of $50,000, the insurance company would pay $50,000, right? Because the insured amount meets the 80% requirement, so no penalty.

But if the insured amount were only $60,000, which is less than 80% of $100,000 (which would be $80k), then the insurance company would apply a penalty. The penalty would be calculated as (60k / 80k) * loss. So for a $50k loss, they would pay (60/80)*50k = 37.5k.

So in our problem, since Mr. Singer has the required 80% coverage, the insurance company pays the full loss, up to the policy limit. The loss is $10,500, which is less than the policy's $36k, so they pay the full $10,500.

Wait, but another way to look at it is: the coinsurance clause requires that the insured must have coverage of at least 80% of the value to get full payment. If he meets that, the insurance pays the loss as per the policy. So yes, in this case, he meets it, so they pay the full loss, which is $10,500.

So the correct answer should be option E: $10,500.

But wait, I'm seeing that option B is $9,000, which is 80% of 10,500. Wait, no, 80% of 10,500 is 8,400, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the coinsurance applies such that the insurance company only pays 80% of the loss, regardless of the insured amount. But that doesn't make sense because the purpose of coinsurance is to encourage the insured to carry adequate coverage. So if they do, the company pays in full.

So I think I'm correct that the answer is E: $10,500.

Wait, but looking back, the initial calculation: the coinsurance clause is 80%, and he has exactly 80% coverage. So the insurance company pays the full loss, which is $10,500. So the answer is E.

To determine how much the insurance company will pay, we need to analyze the coinsurance clause and the specific details of the policy. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Understanding the Coinsurance Clause**:  
   The policy has an 80% coinsurance clause, which means the insured must cover at least 80% of the property's value to receive full payment for a loss. If the insured amount is less than 80% of the property's value, the insurance company will only pay a proportion of the loss.

2. **Key Values**:  
   - Property value: $45,000  
   - Insured amount: $36,000  
   - Loss: $10,500  

3. **Check if the Insured Amount Meets the Coinsurance Requirement**:  
   - 80% of the property's value is $45,000 × 0.8 = $36,000.  
   - The insured amount is $36,000, which matches the required 80%. Therefore, Mr. Singer meets the coinsurance requirement.

4. **Determine the Insurance Company's Payment**:  
   - Since the insured amount meets the 80% requirement, the insurance company will pay the full loss, up to the policy limit.  
   - The loss is $10,500, which is less than the policy limit of $36,000. Therefore, the insurance company will pay the full $10,500.

5. **Verify the Options**:  
   - Option E corresponds to $10,500, which matches the calculated payment.

Thus, the insurance company will pay **$10,500**. 

**Answer: E**
