Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says that a saturated solution of the strong electrolyte Ca(OH)₂ is prepared by adding enough water to 5.0 × 10^-4 mole of Ca(OH)₂ to make 100 ml of solution. I need to find the pH of this solution. The options are from A to J, with various numbers.

Hmm, I remember that pH is related to the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution. Since Ca(OH)₂ is a strong electrolyte, it should dissociate completely in water. Wait, but wait—calcium hydroxide is usually Ca(OH)₂? Or is it Ca(OH)₂? Oh wait, no, wait. Calcium has a +2 charge, and hydroxide is -1. So the formula would be Ca(OH)₂. Yes, that makes sense. So each formula unit gives one Ca²+ and two OH⁻ ions.

So the first thing I need to do is figure out the concentration of OH⁻ ions in the solution. Because once I have that, I can find pOH and then pH.

The solution is saturated, but in this case, since Ca(OH)₂ is a strong electrolyte, I think that means it's completely soluble? Or does it have a solubility limit? Wait, no, wait. Wait, strong electrolytes typically dissociate completely, but their solubility can vary. Wait, no—for example, NaOH is a strong electrolyte and very soluble. But Ca(OH)₂, I think, is not as soluble as NaOH. Wait, but the problem says it's a saturated solution, which usually means that the solution is at the limit of solubility—so any more solute would not dissolve.

Wait, but wait, in this problem, they added sufficient water to a certain amount of Ca(OH)₂ to make 100 ml of solution. So the Ca(OH)₂ is fully dissolved because we're just adding enough water to make the solution. So, perhaps it's a saturated solution because the amount of Ca(OH)₂ is such that when dissolved in 100 ml, it's at the solubility limit. Or maybe it's not, but the problem says it's a saturated solution, so I think I have to proceed accordingly.

Wait, but the problem says it's a saturated solution of Ca(OH)₂. So the solution is at the point where adding more Ca(OH)₂ wouldn't dissolve—it would precipitate. So, the solubility of Ca(OH)₂ in water is a certain value, and in this case, the solution is saturated, meaning that the concentration is at the solubility limit.

Wait, but wait. If Ca(OH)₂ is a strong electrolyte, then it should dissociate completely. So, when it's in a saturated solution, the solution is saturated with respect to Ca(OH)₂. So, the solubility product, Ksp, would be relevant here, perhaps.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps because it's a strong electrolyte, it's completely ionized, so its concentration is determined by its solubility. Hmm, I might be getting a bit confused here.

Wait, let me think again. So, Ca(OH)₂ is a strong base and a strong electrolyte, so it dissociates completely into Ca²+ and 2 OH⁻ ions. So, if the solution is saturated, the concentration of Ca²+ and OH⁻ would be determined by the solubility of Ca(OH)₂ in water.

Wait, but perhaps the solubility of Ca(OH)₂ is given by the Ksp. Alternatively, maybe for strong bases, the solubility is high enough that the solution is considered concentrated in OH⁻ ions.

Wait, but in this problem, the amount of Ca(OH)₂ is given as 5.0 × 10^-4 moles in 100 ml of solution. So perhaps it's fully soluble, and we can calculate the concentration of OH⁻ ions directly.

Wait, but the problem says it's a saturated solution, so maybe the Ca(OH)₂ isn't fully soluble, and the given amount is the maximum that can dissolve in 100 ml. So the concentration of Ca²+ and OH⁻ would be based on that.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that all the Ca(OH)₂ dissolves, and calculate the OH⁻ concentration from that.

So, Ca(OH)₂ dissociates as Ca(OH)₂ → Ca²+ + 2 OH⁻.

The moles of Ca(OH)₂ is 5.0e-4 mol, and the volume is 0.1 L (100 ml). So the molarity (M) of Ca(OH)₂ would be (5.0e-4 mol) / 0.1 L = 5e-3 M.

Each mole of Ca(OH)₂ gives 2 moles of OH⁻, so the concentration of OH⁻ would be 2 * 5e-3 M = 0.01 M.

Wait, that seems manageable. So, [OH⁻] = 0.01 M.

Then, the pOH is calculated as -log[OH⁻]. So, log(0.01) is -2, so pOH = 2.

Then, since pH + pOH = 14, pH would be 12.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, that would be if all of the Ca(OH)₂ is dissolved, but the problem says it's a saturated solution. So perhaps that's the case—if the solution is saturated, then this is the maximum possible concentration of OH⁻, and hence the pH would be 12.

Looking at the options, option D is 12.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because I thought that Ca(OH)₂ isn't very soluble in water. Let me think about the solubility of Ca(OH)₂. From what I remember, calcium hydroxide has a solubility of about 0.02 g per 100 ml of water at 20°C. Let's calculate that in terms of moles.

The molar mass of Ca(OH)₂ is 40 (Ca) + 2*(16 + 1) = 40 + 34 = 74 g/mol.

So 0.02 g is 0.02 / 74 ≈ 0.00027 mol per 100 ml (0.1 L), so that's 0.0027 M. Wait, but in the problem, we have 5e-4 mol in 100 ml, which is 5e-4 / 0.1 = 5e-3 M, which is higher than 0.0027 M. So that would mean that the solution is supersaturated, which is not possible. So perhaps my initial assumption was wrong.

Wait, that suggests that the given amount of Ca(OH)₂ (5e-4 mol) in 100 ml would actually exceed the solubility, so the solution can't hold that much, so only a part of it would dissolve, and the rest would precipitate. Thus, the actual concentration of OH⁻ would be determined by the solubility product, Ksp.

Wait, but wait. Since Ca(OH)₂ is a strong base, perhaps it's considered to be fully ionized, but its solubility is limited. So, perhaps the solubility is determined by the Ksp.

Wait, but Ca(OH)₂ is a strong electrolyte and would dissociate completely, so for solubility, the Ksp would be very high, but in reality, Ca(OH)₂ isn't as soluble as group 1 hydroxides. Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem treats Ca(OH)₂ as a strong base that is fully soluble in the given quantity. But given the earlier calculation, 5e-3 M for Ca(OH)₂ would mean [OH⁻] is 0.01 M, but if the solubility is lower, that can't happen.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's consider that Ca(OH)₂ is a strong base and thus fully dissociates. So, the moles of OH⁻ would be twice the moles of Ca(OH)₂, as I calculated before.

So, if I have 5e-4 mol of Ca(OH)₂ in 0.1 L, that's 5e-3 M for Ca(OH)₂, leading to 1e-2 M OH⁻, which is pH 12.

But given that the solubility of Ca(OH)₂ in water is lower than that, I'm getting conflicting information. Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that all the Ca(OH)₂ dissolves, regardless of its actual solubility. Because, after all, the question says it's a saturated solution prepared by adding sufficient water. So maybe in this context, the solution is at the point where adding more water would cause it to precipitate, but in this case, the amount of water added makes it exactly saturated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying things, and we don't need to worry about real-world solubility because the question says it's a strong electrolyte, so it's fully ionized.

Wait, so perhaps I should proceed with the calculation as if all the Ca(OH)₂ dissolves, giving [OH⁻] = 0.01 M, pOH = 2, so pH = 12, which is option D.

But then, I'm a bit unsure because of the solubility aspect. Let me try to think of another approach.

Another approach: For a saturated solution of Ca(OH)₂, we can write the dissolution as:

Ca(OH)₂(s) ⇌ Ca²+ (aq) + 2 OH⁻ (aq)

The solubility product, Ksp, is [Ca²+][OH⁻]^2.

Since Ca(OH)₂ is a strong electrolyte, perhaps it's assumed that it dissociates completely, so Ksp is very large, implying high solubility. But in reality, Ca(OH)₂ isn't that soluble. So maybe we need to use the actual Ksp value.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give us the Ksp. Hmm.

Alternatively, the problem says that Ca(OH)₂ is a strong electrolyte, so it's fully ionized. So, the concentration of OH⁻ is determined by the amount that can dissolve.

Wait, but in that case, the initial calculation of 0.01 M OH⁻ would still hold, leading to pH 12.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the molarity based on the given moles and volume. So, moles of Ca(OH)₂ is 5e-4 mol in 0.1 L, so 5e-3 M. Each mole gives 2 OH⁻, so 1e-2 M OH⁻.

Yes, that seems right. So then, pOH is -log(1e-2) = 2, so pH is 12.

Looking back at the options, option D is 12.

So I think the correct answer is D:12.

To determine the pH of a saturated solution of the strong electrolyte Ca(OH)₂, we start by analyzing the dissociation of Ca(OH)₂ in water. The compound dissociates completely as follows:

\[
\text{Ca(OH)}_2 \rightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + 2 \text{OH}^-
\]

The problem states that 5.0 × 10⁻⁴ moles of Ca(OH)₂ are dissolved in 100 mL (0.1 L) of water. The molarity of Ca(OH)₂ is calculated as:

\[
\text{Molarity of Ca(OH)}_2 = \frac{\text{moles of Ca(OH)}_2}{\text{volume of solution in liters}} = \frac{5.0 \times 10^{-4}}{0.1} = 5.0 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}
\]

Since each mole of Ca(OH)₂ produces 2 moles of OH⁻, the concentration of OH⁻ ions is:

\[
[\text{OH}^-] = 2 \times 5.0 \times 10^{-3} = 1.0 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{M}
\]

The pOH of the solution is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH}^-] = -\log(1.0 \times 10^{-2}) = 2
\]

The pH is then determined using the relationship:

\[
\text{pH} + \text{pOH} = 14 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{pH} = 14 - 2 = 12
\]

Thus, the pH of the saturated solution is 12. This calculation assumes that Ca(OH)₂ is a strong electrolyte and dissociates completely, which is consistent with the problem's description.

The correct answer is:

**D: 12**
