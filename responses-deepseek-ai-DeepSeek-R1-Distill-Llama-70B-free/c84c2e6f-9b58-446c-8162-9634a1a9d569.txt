Okay, so I've got this question about telescopes, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see... The question is about finding the angular magnification and the eyepiece focal length. Hmm.

Alright, the problem says the objective lens has a focal length of 40 cm and an f-number of f/5. Oh wait, f-number is the ratio of the focal length to the diameter of the aperture, right? So f-number = f/D, where D is the diameter. So if f is 40 cm and f-number is 5, then D = f/(f-number) = 40 /5 = 8 cm. So the diameter of the objective is 8 cm.

Then it says for parallel rays, the exit pupil has a diameter of 2 cm. Exit pupil... I remember that the exit pupil is related to the entrance pupil. The entrance pupil is the aperture of the objective. Oh wait, the exit pupil diameter is the diameter of the eyepiece's exit beam. So exit pupil formula is (D_objective)/(f_number) * (f_eyepiece/f_objective). Or maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, angular magnification M is given by the ratio of the objective focal length to the eyepiece focal length, right? So M = f_objective / f_eyepiece. That's one formula I remember.

But wait, there's another thing about the exit pupil. The exit pupil diameter is related to the entrance pupil. The entrance pupil is the objective's diameter, which is 8 cm. The exit pupil is given as 2 cm. So maybe the ratio of exit pupil to entrance pupil is the same as the ratio of the eyepiece focal length to the objective focal length? Not sure. Let me think.

Wait, I think the exit pupil diameter (d_pupil) is equal to (D_objective) * (f_eyepiece / f_objective). Because when the object is at infinity, the image forms at the focal point of the objective, and the eyepiece acts as a magnifier. So the exit pupil is the image of the entrance pupil formed by the eyepiece.

So, d_pupil = (D_objective) * (f_eyepiece / f_objective )

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. The exit pupil size is given by (D_objective) * (f_eyepiece / f_objective). So in our case, 2 cm = 8 cm * (f_eyepiece / 40 cm )

So solving for f_eyepiece: 2 = 8 * (f_eyepiece /40 )

Hmm, 2 = (8 f_e)/40 → 2 = f_e /5 → f_e = 10 cm.

So the eyepiece focal length is 10 cm.

Wait, but wait another thing. Angular magnification M is f_objective / f_eyepiece. So M = 40 /10 =4x. So angular magnification is 4x, and eyepiece focal length is 10 cm.

Looking at the options, option D says 4x, 10 cm. So that would be the answer.

But let me make sure I didn't mix up any formulas. Another approach: The magnification is also given by M = (f_objective)/(f_eyepiece). So if the eyepiece is 10 cm, M is 40/10=4x. That matches.

Wait, another way to calculate M using the pupils: the magnification can also be found by the ratio of the pupils, but I think that's the linear magnification, not the angular. Because the exit pupil diameter is smaller, but the angular size is magnified.

Alternatively, the magnification is the ratio of the angular sizes. The exit pupil's size relates to how much the image is magnified. Wait, not exactly, because the exit pupil is the diameter of the light beam leaving the eyepiece. So the exit pupil diameter is actually the same as the diameter of the image formed by the eyepiece of the entrance pupil.

So the ratio of exit pupil to entrance pupil diameter is (f_eyepiece / f_objective). So (2 cm)/(8 cm) = 1/4 = f_e /40 → f_e=10 cm. So that's consistent with what I found earlier.

So M is 40/10=4x. So the correct answer should be 4x and 10 cm, which is option D.

To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given data:

1. The objective lens has a focal length \( f_{\text{objective}} = 40 \, \text{cm} \) and an f-number of \( f/5 \). The f-number is defined as the ratio of the focal length to the diameter of the aperture, so the diameter of the objective lens is:

\[
D_{\text{objective}} = \frac{f_{\text{objective}}}{\text{f-number}} = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \, \text{cm}.
\]

2. The exit pupil diameter is given as \( d_{\text{pupil}} = 2 \, \text{cm} \). The exit pupil diameter is related to the eyepiece focal length \( f_{\text{eyepiece}} \) and the objective focal length \( f_{\text{objective}} \) by the formula:

\[
d_{\text{pupil}} = D_{\text{objective}} \cdot \frac{f_{\text{eyepiece}}}{f_{\text{objective}}}.
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
2 = 8 \cdot \frac{f_{\text{eyepiece}}}{40}.
\]

Solving for \( f_{\text{eyepiece}} \):

\[
f_{\text{eyepiece}} = \frac{2 \cdot 40}{8} = 10 \, \text{cm}.
\]

3. The angular magnification \( M \) of the telescope is given by the ratio of the objective focal length to the eyepiece focal length:

\[
M = \frac{f_{\text{objective}}}{f_{\text{eyepiece}}} = \frac{40}{10} = 4 \, \text{x}.
\]

Thus, the angular magnification is \( 4 \, \text{x} \), and the eyepiece focal length is \( 10 \, \text{cm} \). Comparing these results with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**D: 4x, 10 cm**
