Question:

After learning that a new housing development was about to be built, a developer began looking for property near the housing development on which he could build a shopping center. After an extensive search, he purchased a three-acre undeveloped tract of land for the purpose of developing a small shopping center. At the time the sale was finalized, the developer told his plans to the seller of the three-acre tract, and also mentioned that he was worried whether he had sufficient funds to complete the project. The seller agreed to lend money to the developer to allow for completion of the project. The seller then wrote out the following contract:"In order to help the developer with his plans for development of a shopping center on the three- acre tract he has this day purchased from me, I will lend him $50,000 at 10 percent interest provided he signs a contract with a builder for construction of the shopping center on this tract. Repayment to me at the rate of $5,000 per year to be secured by a mortgage on the three-acre tract. "Both parties then signed the contract. The seller's promise to lend $50,000 to the developer is

Options:

A: a condition precedent to the developer's duty to construct the shopping center.
B: a condition subsequent to the developer's duty to enter into a building construction contract.
C: not a condition, either precedent or subsequent, to the developer's duty to enter into a building construction contract.
D: a condition subsequent in form but precedent in substance to the seller's duty to lend the $50,000.
E: a condition precedent in form but subsequent in substance to the developer's duty to enter into a building construction contract.
F: a condition subsequent to the seller's duty to lend the $50,000.
G: a condition subsequent in form but precedent in substance to the developer's duty to enter into a building construction contract.
H: a condition precedent to the developer's duty to repay the loan.
I: not a condition, either precedent or subsequent, to the seller's duty to lend the $50,000.
J: a condition precedent in form but subsequent in substance to the developer's duty to repay the loan.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this contract law question. Let's break it down step by step. The situation involves a developer who bought land to build a shopping center and a seller who agreed to lend him money under certain conditions.

First, the key points: The developer bought a three-acre tract. He told the seller he might not have enough funds, so the seller offered to lend him $50,000 at 10% interest. But there's a condition: the developer must sign a contract with a builder to construct the shopping center on that land. Repayment is $5,000 a year, secured by a mortgage on the land. Both signed this contract.

The question is about the nature of the seller's promise to lend $50,000. The options are about whether it's a condition precedent, condition subsequent, or not a condition at all, and to what duty it relates.

I remember that in contract law, conditions are events that must occur before a party's duty arises. A condition precedent is an event that must happen before a party is obligated to perform. A condition subsequent is an event that, if it happens, ends an existing duty.

Looking at the contract, the seller's promise is to lend money provided the developer signs a contract with a builder. So the developer's action (signing the building contract) is a condition for the seller to lend the money.

Wait, but is this condition affecting the seller's duty to lend or the developer's duty to do something else? The condition is about the developer's action, so it's a condition to the seller's obligation.

In other words, the seller's duty to lend is contingent upon the developer first signing the building contract. So the signing is a condition precedent to the seller's duty to lend the money.

But the options don't seem to directly state that. Let me look at the options again.

Option A says it's a condition precedent to the developer's duty to construct. But the developer's duty is to sign a contract with a builder, not necessarily to construct. So maybe not A.

Option B: condition subsequent to the developer's duty to enter into a building contract. No, because it's a condition that must be met before the seller's duty arises.

Option C: Not a condition. No, because the loan is clearly conditional on the developer signing the building contract.

Option D: Condition subsequent in form but precedent in substance to seller's duty. That would mean it's worded as a subsequent condition but functions as a precedent. I don't think that's the case here.

Option E: Condition precedent in form but subsequent in substance. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let's think again. The contract says the seller will lend money provided the developer signs the contract with the builder. So signing the builder contract is a condition the developer must meet for the seller to be obligated to lend. So it's a condition precedent to the seller's duty to lend.

Looking at the options, none of them directly say that. Wait, option I says it's not a condition to the seller's duty to lend. But I thought it was a condition.

Alternatively, maybe the condition is about the developer's duty. Let me re-examine the question. The options are about the seller's promise to lend. So what is the condition affecting?

The contract says the seller will lend provided the developer signs a building contract. So the seller's duty to lend is conditioned on the developer signing. Therefore, the developer signing is a condition precedent to the seller's duty.

Looking at the options, I need to find which option correctly identifies this.

Option E says it's a condition precedent in form but subsequent in substance to the developer's duty. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of it this way: the condition is that the developer must do X (sign a building contract) for the seller to do Y (lend money).

So the condition (developer signing) is a condition precedent for the seller's duty to lend. Because the seller's duty only arises if the condition is met.

Looking at the options, which one matches this?

Option A: condition precedent to developer's duty to construct. No, because the developer's duty is to sign a contract, not construct.

Option B: condition subsequent to developer's duty to enter into contract. No, because it's not a subsequent condition.

Option C: Not a condition. No.

Option D: Condition subsequent in form but precedent in substance to seller's duty. No, because the condition is that the developer must first act, so it's a condition precedent.

Option E: Condition precedent in form but subsequent in substance to developer's duty. I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the condition is on the developer's action, but affects the seller's duty. So the condition is a condition precedent to the seller's duty to lend.

Looking at the options, is there any that says this? Let's see.

Option H: condition precedent to developer's duty to repay. No.

Option I: Not a condition to seller's duty to lend. No, because it's definitely a condition.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The condition is that the developer must sign a contract with a builder before the seller is obligated to lend. So the developer's signing is a condition precedent to the seller's duty to lend.

So the correct answer should be that the seller's promise is conditional upon the developer signing the building contract, making it a condition precedent to the seller's duty to lend.

Looking at the options, I don't see an option that clearly states this. Let me check again.

Wait, option E says: a condition precedent in form but subsequent in substance to the developer's duty to enter into a building contract. So the form is that the developer must do something first (precedent), but in substance, it's a subsequent condition regarding the developer's duty.

Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the condition is a condition subsequent to the developer's duty.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think of it differently. The contract says the seller will lend if the developer signs a contract. So the developer's signing is a condition that must occur before the seller's duty arises. That's a condition precedent.

So the correct option would be that the seller's promise is subject to a condition precedent.

Looking at the options:

Option A: condition precedent to developer's duty to construct. No.

Option B: condition subsequent to developer's duty to enter into building contract. No.

Option C: not a condition. No.

Option E: condition precedent in form but subsequent in substance. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the condition is a condition precedent to the seller's duty. So the correct answer would be that the seller's duty is subject to a condition precedent, which is the developer signing the contract.

Looking at the options, option E says it's a condition precedent in form but subsequent in substance to the developer's duty. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is a condition subsequent. Wait, no. Because if the developer fails to sign, the seller doesn't have to lend. So the condition must be met before the seller is obligated.

Wait, maybe none of the options directly address this, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is not a condition at all. Wait, no, because the contract explicitly states that the loan is provided the developer signs the contract. So it's definitely a condition.

Wait, another approach: in contract law, when a condition is stated as "provided that" or "on condition that", it's typically a condition precedent. So here, the seller's duty is conditional upon the developer signing the contract. So the condition is a condition precedent to the seller's duty to lend.

So looking at the options, the correct answer would be that the seller's promise is subject to a condition precedent.

But the options don't have that. Let me look again.

Wait, option E says: a condition precedent in form but subsequent in substance to the developer's duty to enter into a building contract.

Wait, the condition is about the developer's action, but it affects the seller's duty. So the developer's duty is to enter into a building contract, and the seller's duty is to lend.

So the condition is a condition precedent to the seller's duty. But none of the options state that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C: not a condition. But that can't be right because the contract clearly has a condition.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is a condition subsequent. No, because the condition must be fulfilled before the seller's duty arises.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting tangled up. Let me try to rephrase.

The seller's obligation to lend is conditioned on the developer signing a building contract. So the developer must first sign the contract (condition precedent), and then the seller is obligated to lend.

So the developer's signing is a condition precedent to the seller's duty.

Looking at the options, the question is about the seller's promise, so the options are about whether it's a condition to the developer's duty or the seller's duty.

Option A: condition precedent to developer's duty to construct. No, because it's about signing a contract, not constructing.

Option B: condition subsequent to developer's duty to enter into building contract. No, because it's a condition that must be met before the seller's duty arises.

Option C: not a condition. No.

Option D: condition subsequent in form but precedent in substance to seller's duty. No, because it's a condition precedent.

Option E: condition precedent in form but subsequent in substance to developer's duty. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps the condition is a condition subsequent to the seller's duty. Because if the developer fails to sign, the seller's duty to lend doesn't arise, meaning the condition is subsequent.

Wait, no. Condition subsequent is when the condition, if it occurs, terminates an existing duty. Here, the condition is that the developer must do something for the seller's duty to begin. So it's a condition precedent.

I think I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer is option E, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps it's option C, but that doesn't make sense because there's a clear condition.

Wait, another approach: the condition is about the developer's action, but does it affect the developer's duty or the seller's duty?

The condition is that the developer signs a building contract. So the developer has a duty to sign the contract, and if he doesn't, the seller's duty to lend doesn't arise.

Wait, but the developer's duty is to sign the contract, which is a condition for the seller's duty. So the developer's signing is a condition precedent to the seller's duty to lend.

But the options are about what the seller's promise is in terms of conditions.

Looking again, the options:

Option A: condition precedent to developer's duty to construct. No, because it's about signing, not constructing.

Option B: condition subsequent to developer's duty to enter into building contract. No, because it's a condition that must be met before the seller's duty arises.

Option C: not a condition. No.

Option E: condition precedent in form but subsequent in substance to developer's duty. Maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the seller's promise is not subject to a condition but is an absolute promise. But that can't be, because the contract says "provided he signs."

Wait, perhaps the condition is a condition subsequent. No, because the condition isn't about terminating an existing duty, but about creating the duty in the first place.

I think I'm going in circles. Let me try to recall: a condition precedent is an event that must occur before an obligation arises. Here, the developer must sign the contract before the seller is obliged to lend. So the condition is a condition precedent to the seller's duty to lend.

But looking at the options, none directly state this. The options are about the developer's duties, not the seller's.

Wait, the options are about the seller's promise being a condition to the developer's duty or the seller's duty. The question is: The seller's promise to lend is what type of condition?

So the seller's promise is conditional on the developer signing a building contract. Therefore, the developer signing is a condition precedent to the seller's duty to lend.

So the correct answer would be that the seller's promise is subject to a condition precedent, which is the developer's action.

Looking at the options, option E says: a condition precedent in form but subsequent in substance to the developer's duty to enter into a building contract. So the form is that the developer must do something first (precedent), but in substance, it's a subsequent condition regarding the developer's duty.

Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about the duty that's conditioned.

The condition affects the seller's duty to lend. So the condition is a condition precedent to the seller's duty.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option I, which says it's not a condition to the seller's duty. But that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the condition is a condition subsequent to the developer's duty. But that doesn't fit because the condition must be met before the seller's duty arises.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is a condition subsequent in form but a condition precedent in substance.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option E: condition precedent in form but subsequent in substance to the developer's duty.

But I'm not entirely confident. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, another angle: the developer's duty is to sign a building contract. The seller's duty is to lend. The signing is a condition that must be met before the seller's duty arises. So the condition is a condition precedent to the seller's duty.

Looking at the options, the correct answer should be that it's a condition precedent to the seller's duty to lend. But none of the options state this directly.

Wait, looking back at the options, option I says: not a condition, either precedent or subsequent, to the seller's duty to lend. But that's incorrect because the contract clearly has a condition.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe the condition is a condition subsequent. No, I think it's a condition precedent.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option E: condition precedent in form but subsequent in substance to the developer's duty. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B: condition subsequent to the developer's duty to enter into a building contract. But that doesn't seem right because it's a condition that must be met before the seller's duty arises.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should pick option E, but I'm not entirely sure.

The question revolves around the nature of the seller's promise to lend $50,000 to the developer, specifically whether it is a condition precedent, condition subsequent, or not a condition at all. The key facts are that the seller agreed to lend the money "provided" the developer signs a contract with a builder to construct the shopping center. This indicates that the developer's action (signing the contract) is a condition tied to the seller's duty to lend.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Condition Precedent vs. Condition Subsequent**:  
   - A **condition precedent** is an event that must occur before a party's duty arises.  
   - A **condition subsequent** is an event that, if it occurs, terminates an existing duty.  

2. **Application to the Facts**:  
   - The seller's duty to lend is explicitly conditioned on the developer signing a contract with a builder. This means the developer's signing of the contract is a condition that must be fulfilled before the seller's duty to lend arises.  
   - This makes the condition a **condition precedent** to the seller's duty to lend.  

3. **Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The condition is not tied to the developer's duty to construct but rather to their duty to sign a contract with a builder.  
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. The condition must be met before the seller's duty arises, so it is not a condition subsequent.  
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The contract explicitly states a condition (the developer signing a contract with a builder), so it is not "not a condition."  
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. The condition is not subsequent in form or substance to the seller's duty.  
   - **Option E**: Plausible. The condition is worded as a condition precedent (the developer must act first), but it could be interpreted as subsequent in substance because it affects the developer's duty to enter into a building contract.  
   - **Option F**: Incorrect. The condition is not a condition subsequent to the seller's duty to lend.  
   - **Option G**: Incorrect. The condition is not subsequent in form but precedent in substance.  
   - **Option H**: Incorrect. The condition is not tied to the developer's duty to repay the loan.  
   - **Option I**: Incorrect. The condition explicitly affects the seller's duty to lend.  
   - **Option J**: Incorrect. The condition is not tied to the developer's duty to repay the loan.  

### Conclusion:
The condition is best described as a **condition precedent in form but subsequent in substance to the developer's duty to enter into a building construction contract**. While the condition must be fulfilled before the seller's duty arises (precedent in form), it ultimately affects the developer's duty to secure the loan by signing the contract (subsequent in substance).
