Okay, so I've got this question about finding eigenvalues for three different matrices, and I need to choose the correct option from A to J. Hmm, I remember that eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0. Right, for each matrix, I'll need to set up that equation and find the roots.

Let's start with part (a), which is the first matrix. The matrix given is a 2x2:

|3 1|
|1 3|

So the matrix A is [[3,1],[1,3]]. To find the eigenvalues, I subtract λ from the diagonals and compute the determinant.

The characteristic equation is (3-λ)^2 - (1)(1) = 0. Expanding that: (9 -6λ + λ²) -1 = λ² -6λ +8 =0.

I can factor this quadratic: (λ-2)(λ-4) =0, so λ=2 and λ=4. So the eigenvalues for the first matrix are 2 and 4. Looking at the options, let me check each option's first matrix. Option A says 4,1; that's not matching. Option B: 3,2? No. Option C:4,2 yes, that fits. Wait, let me check the others. Option D: 5,2 no. Option E:4,4 no. Option F:2,4 yes, same as C but in different order. Hmm, I'll note that.

Wait, actually, since the eigenvalues are 2 and 4, any option that has those two for the first matrix is a possibility. So C and F are candidates for part (a), but I need to check the other matrices too.

Now part (b) is the second matrix, which is 3x3:

|2 2 1|
|1 3 1|
|1 2 2|

Hmm, this seems a bit trickier. The matrix is:

[2, 2, 1]
[1, 3, 1]
[1, 2, 2]

I need to find the eigenvalues. One approach is to compute the determinant of (A - λI) and solve for λ. But for a 3x3, that's a bit involved. Alternatively, maybe I can find the trace and see if some patterns emerge.

Alternatively, perhaps this matrix has some repeated eigenvalues or maybe it's a special matrix. Let's see. The sum of each row: first row sums to 5, second to 5, third to 5. Oh wait, that means that each row sums to the same value, 5. That suggests that 5 is an eigenvalue because the vector [1,1,1] would be an eigenvector. So 5 is one eigenvalue.

But wait, let me confirm. If I multiply the matrix by [1,1,1], what do I get?

First entry: 2*1 +2*1 +1*1 =5. Similarly for the other rows, each will give 5. So yes, 5 is an eigenvalue, and the corresponding eigenvector is [1,1,1].

Now, what about the other eigenvalues? Since the trace equals the sum of eigenvalues. The trace of this matrix is 2+3+2=7. So if one eigenvalue is 5, the sum of the other two must be 2.

Also, the determinant of the matrix should be the product of the eigenvalues. Let me compute the determinant of A.

Matrix A:

2 2 1

1 3 1

1 2 2

Calculating the determinant:

= 2*(3*2 -1*2) -2*(1*2 -1*1) +1*(1*2 -3*1)

= 2*(6-2) -2*(2-1) +1*(2-3)

= 2*4 -2*1 +1*(-1)

=8 -2 -1=5.

So determinant is 5. So the product of eigenvalues is 5. We have one eigenvalue as 5, so the product of the other two is 1 (since 5 * a * b =5 → a*b=1).

Wait, wait, no. Wait: the determinant is the product of all eigenvalues. So if the eigenvalues are 5, a, b, then 5*a*b=5. So a*b=1.

We also have that a + b=2. So the two numbers a and b satisfy a + b=2 and a*b=1. So the quadratic equation is x² -2x +1=0, which factors into (x-1)^2=0. So both a and b are 1. So the eigenvalues are 5,1,1.

So for part (b), the eigenvalues are 5,1,1.

Wait, wait, but looking at the options, let me check each option's second matrix. Let's see:

Option C for part (b): 1,2,3 → sum is 6, which doesn't fit because trace is 7. So that can't be.

Option D: second matrix eigenvalues 1,2,3 → sum 6, trace is 7 → no. Not correct.

Option A: second matrix: 3,1,1 → sum 5, but trace is 7 → no.

Option B: second matrix:1,1,4 → sum 6. Again, trace is 7, so no.

Option E: second matrix: 2,1,5 → sum 8, which is higher than 7.

Option F: second matrix: 2,2,3 → sum 7, which matches. So the eigenvalues would be 2,2,3. Wait, but earlier I thought the eigenvalues were 5,1,1. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because the trace is 7, and I found one eigenvalue as 5. Then the sum of the other two is 2, and their product is 1. So 1 and 1.

Wait, no, that would make the sum 5+1+1=7, which is correct. But option F's second matrix has eigenvalues 2,2,3, which sum to 7, but product of all three would be 2*2*3=12. But the determinant is 5, so that can't be. So option F's second matrix can't be correct because det should be 5, but 2*2*3=12.

I must have made a mistake. Let me recalculate the determinant.

Wait, determinant calculation again:

Matrix:

Row 1: 2,2,1

Row 2:1,3,1

Row 3:1,2,2

Compute det(A):

2*(3*2 -1*2) -2*(1*2 -1*1) +1*(1*2 -3*1)

=2*(6-2) -2*(2-1) +1*(2-3)

=2*4 -2*1 +1*(-1)

=8 -2 -1=5. So determinant is indeed 5.

So the product of eigenvalues is 5. So if one eigenvalue is 5, the other two must be 1 and 1, because 5*1*1=5.

So for part (b), the eigenvalues are 5,1,1.

Looking at the options, which options have second matrix as 5,1,1? Let's check each option.

Option A: second matrix eigenvalues 3,1,1 → no.

Option B: second matrix 1,1,4 → sum 6, det 4. No.

Option C: second matrix 1,2,3 → sum 6, no.

Option D: second matrix 1,2,3 → same as C.

Option E: second matrix 2,1,5 → sum 8, no.

Option F: second matrix 2,2,3 → sum 7, product 12.

Hmm, none of the options have 5,1,1. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in finding the eigenvalues.

Wait, maybe the matrix doesn't have 5 as an eigenvalue? Wait, the row sums are all 5, so 5 should definitely be an eigenvalue. So perhaps the other eigenvalues add up to 2, but maybe they are different.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the other eigenvalues are 1 and 1. Let me think again.

The characteristic equation is det(A -λI)=0.

So for the matrix:

[2-λ, 2, 1]

[1, 3-λ, 1]

[1, 2, 2-λ]

The determinant is:

(2-λ) [ (3-λ)(2-λ) - (1)(2) ] -2 [ (1)(2-λ) -1*1 ] +1 [1*2 - (3-λ)*1 ]

Let me compute each part step by step.

First term: (2-λ) * [ (3-λ)(2-λ) - 2 ]

Compute (3-λ)(2-λ) =6 -3λ -2λ +λ² = λ² -5λ +6. Subtract 2 gives λ² -5λ +4.

So first term: (2-λ)(λ² -5λ +4)

Second term: -2 * [ (2 -λ) -1 ] = -2*(1 -λ) = -2 + 2λ.

Third term: 1 * [2 - (3 - λ) ] =1*(λ -1) = λ -1.

So the determinant is:

(2-λ)(λ² -5λ +4) + (-2 + 2λ) + (λ -1)

= (2-λ)(λ²-5λ+4) + (2λ -2) + (λ -1)

Expanding (2-λ)(λ²-5λ+4):

Multiply 2 by each term: 2λ² -10λ +8.

Multiply -λ by each term: -λ³ +5λ² -4λ.

So together: -λ³ +5λ² -4λ +2λ² -10λ +8.

Combine like terms:

-λ³ + (5λ² +2λ²)=7λ².

(-4λ -10λ)= -14λ.

Plus 8.

So the first part is -λ³ +7λ² -14λ +8.

Then add the other terms: (2λ -2) + (λ -1) =3λ -3.

So overall determinant equation:

-λ³ +7λ² -14λ +8 +3λ -3 =0

Combine like terms:

-λ³ +7λ² -11λ +5=0.

Multiply both sides by -1 to make it easier:

λ³ -7λ² +11λ -5=0.

We know that λ=5 is a root because when λ=5, it should satisfy the equation.

Let's test λ=5:

5^3 -7*(5)^2 +11*5 -5 =125 - 175 +55 -5 = (125-175)= -50; (-50 +55)=5; 5-5=0. Yes, correct.

So factor out (λ-5):

Using polynomial division or synthetic division.

Divide λ³ -7λ² +11λ -5 by (λ-5).

Using synthetic division:

5 | 1  -7   11   -5

          5  -10    5

      1  -2    1     0

So the quadratic factor is λ² -2λ +1 =0 → (λ-1)^2=0 → λ=1 (double root).

So eigenvalues are 5,1,1. So part (b) has eigenvalues 5,1,1.

But looking back at the options, none of the options have 5,1,1 for the second matrix. Let me check each option's second matrix.

Option A: second matrix: 3,1,1 → no.

Option B: second matrix:1,1,4 → no.

Option C: second matrix:1,2,3 → no.

Option D: second matrix:1,2,3 → no.

Option E: second matrix:2,1,5 → sum 8, but we have 5,1,1 sum 7. So no.

Option F: second matrix:2,2,3 → sum 7, but the product is 12, while determinant is 5. So no.

Option G: second matrix:1,1,2 → sum 4, no.

Option H: second matrix:1,2,2 → sum 5, no.

Option I: second matrix:1,1,5 → sum 7, yes. Because 5+1+1=7. So determinant is 5*1*1=5, which matches.

Wait, option I's second matrix eigenvalues are 1,1,5. So that's correct. So part (b) is 1,1,5. So the eigenvalues are 5,1,1, but order doesn't matter because eigenvalues are a set. So option I has 1,1,5 for part (b).

Wait, but earlier for part (a), the eigenvalues are 2 and 4. So looking at option I's first matrix, what are they?

Option I: First matrix eigenvalues are 4,2. Which matches our calculation.

So for part (c), which is the third matrix, let's see. The matrix is:

|2- i  10  |
|  9  4 6 |

Wait, wait, the matrix is given as:

(c) |2-10i   946  |

Wait, wait, perhaps the matrix is:

Wait, the user wrote (c) as |2- 10| |946| |- 80- 3|. Hmm, perhaps the matrix is a 3x3? Or maybe a 2x2? Wait, looking back:

The question says:

(c) |2- 10| |946| |- 80- 3|.

Wait, perhaps it's a 3x3 matrix? Or maybe it's a 2x2. Let me read the original question again.

Wait, the user wrote:

(c) |2- 10| |946| |- 80- 3|.

Wait, perhaps it's a 3x3 matrix, but the way it's written is unclear. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 2x2 matrix with entries (2-10i, 946), (-80-3i, something). Hmm, perhaps it's a 2x2 matrix with complex entries.

Wait, perhaps the matrix is:

[2-10i, 946]

[946, -80-3i]

Wait, but that would be a 2x2 matrix. Alternatively, maybe it's written as:

First row: 2-10i, 946

Second row: -80-3i, something? Wait, the way it's written isn't clear. The way the user wrote part (c) is a bit confusing. Let me look again.

The user wrote: (c)\vert2- 10\vert \vert946\vert \vert- 80- 3\vert

Wait, that's using the \vert symbols, which usually denote determinants. So maybe each part is a separate determinant. Wait, but the question is about eigenvalues, not determinants. So I think I might have misread the question.

Wait, perhaps the matrices are:

(a) is [[3,1],[1,3]]

(b) is [[2,2,1],[1,3,1],[1,2,2]]

(c) is a 3x3 matrix with entries: 2-10i, 946, -80-3i, but I'm not sure how they're arranged. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 2x2 matrix with entries:

First row: 2-10i, 946

Second row: -80-3i, something? But that would make the matrix dimensions mismatched. Wait, perhaps it's a 2x2 matrix with entries:

[2-10i, 946]

[946, -80-3i]

But that would be a symmetric matrix except for the imaginary parts. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo, and the third matrix is:

[2, -10i; 9,46; -80, -3i] or something, but that doesn't make sense as a 3x3.

Wait, perhaps the third matrix is a 3x3 with entries:

First row: 2-10i, 94,6

Second row: something else, but the way it's written is unclear. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the third matrix is:

[2-10i, 946]

[ -80-3i, something], but perhaps it's a 2x2 matrix.

Wait, perhaps the third matrix is:

[2-10i, 946;

-80-3i, 4]

Wait, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the third matrix is 2x2:

A = [ [2-10i, 946], [-80-3i, x] ]

But without knowing x, it's impossible. Wait, the user wrote part (c) as:

\vert2- 10\vert \vert946\vert \vert- 80- 3\vert

Which looks more like |2-10|, |946|, |-80-3|. But that can't be, because those are determinants, but the question is about eigenvalues. Hmm, perhaps it's a typo, and the third matrix is a 3x3:

First row: 2-10i, 9,46

Second row: something else, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 2x2 matrix where the entries are complex numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps the third matrix is:

[2, -10i]

[946, -80-3i]

Wait, that would make it:

[2, -10i]

[946, -80-3i]

But that's a 2x2 matrix with complex entries. So to find the eigenvalues, I can set up the characteristic equation.

So for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues are given by the roots of ( (a -λ)(d -λ) - bc ) =0.

So for matrix:

[[2, -10i],
 [946, -80-3i]]

The determinant of (A - λI) is:

(2 - λ)(-80-3i -λ) - (946)(-10i) =0
