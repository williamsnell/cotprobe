Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about calculating the frequencies of tasters and non-tasters for PTC. Hmm, I remember that PTC tasting ability is related to genetics, specifically a gene with two alleles. Let me think about this.

The question says that out of 146 students tested, 105 were tasters and 41 were non-tasters. I need to find the frequencies of the T and t alleles. Wait, but wait—wait a second. So in this context, T is the dominant allele that allows tasting PTC, and t is recessive. Right, so people with TT or Tt are tasters, and only tt are non-tasters.

But wait, the question is asking for allele frequencies, not genotype frequencies. Oh wait, no, wait! Oh wait, no, no. Wait. The question says "calculate the frequencies of tasters and non-tasters." Oh, wait, so it's the phenotype frequencies, not the allele frequencies. Oh wait, but the options are given as T and t allele frequencies, not the phenotype frequencies. Hmm, that's confusing. Let me read the question again.

Wait, the question says: "Calculate the frequencies of tasters and non-tasters." So that's phenotype frequencies. But the options list the frequencies of T and t, which are alleles. Oh wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. No, maybe the question is actually about genotype frequencies. Or wait, perhaps the question is phrased in a way that the options are about allele frequencies. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should clarify. Let's see. The question is about calculating the frequencies of tasters and non-tasters. That's phenotype frequencies. So tasters are 105 out of 146, non-tasters are 41 out of 146. So their frequencies are 105/146 and 41/146 respectively.

Wait, but looking at the options, they're giving allele frequencies for T and t. So perhaps the question is actually about allele frequencies. Or maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, the question says "frequencies of tasters and non-tasters." So that's the phenotypic frequencies. So the correct approach is to calculate the proportion of tasters (105/146) and non-tasters (41/146).

Let me compute that. 105 divided by 146. Let me calculate that. Hmm. 146 is approximately 146. So 105 divided by 146. Let me compute 105 ÷ 146. Let's see, 146 × 0.7 is 102.2, since 140×0.7=98, 6×0.7=4.2, so 102.2. So 105 is a bit higher. So 105-102.2 is 2.8. So 2.8/146 is roughly 0.019. So 0.7 + 0.019 is approximately 0.719. So about 0.72.

Wait, 105 / 146. Let me compute it more accurately. Let's see, 146 × 0.72 = 105.12, because 100 × 0.72 is 72, 40 × 0.72=28.8, 6 ×0.72=4.32. So 72+28.8=100.8, +4.32=105.12. Oh wait, that's exactly what 0.72 would give. So 105/146 is approximately 0.72, right? Because 0.72 ×146=105.12, which is very close to 105. So tasters are about 0.72 (72%) and non-tasters are about 0.28 (28%).

Wait, but the options don't list taster and non-taster frequencies. Let me look at the options again. The options all give frequencies of T and t, which are the alleles, not the phenotypes. So perhaps I've misunderstood the question. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for genotype frequencies, but that's not what it says.

Wait, the question is asking for the frequencies of tasters and non-tasters, which are phenotypes. So their frequencies are (tasters) 105/146 ≈ 0.72 and (non-tasters) 41/146 ≈ 0.28. But the options list T and t allele frequencies.

Hmm, perhaps I've made a mistake. Maybe the question is actually about allele frequencies, not phenotypic. Let me reevaluate. The question says, "calculate the frequencies of tasters and non-tasters." So that's about phenotypes, not alleles. So the correct answer would be tasters at 0.72 and non-tasters at 0.28. But looking at the options, none of them directly present that. Because the options are about T and t allele frequencies.

Wait, perhaps the question is a bit ambiguous, but given the options, I think it's actually about allele frequencies. Because the options are about T and t, which are alleles. So perhaps the initial data is being used to calculate allele frequencies.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think.

Wait, the problem gives the number of tasters and non-tasters. Tasters are typically dominant (so either TT or Tt), and non-tasters are tt. So to find the allele frequencies, we'd need to find the frequency of T and t.

Wait, but if we're given the number of tasters and non-tasters, maybe we can find the genotype frequencies, and from that the allele frequencies.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Determine the genotype frequencies for tasters and non-tasters.

But wait, tasters include both TT and Tt. So we don't have their exact counts; the problem gives only tasters (105) and non-tasters (41). So without knowing the distribution between TT and Tt, we can't directly compute the allele frequencies. Unless we make some assumptions, like Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

Ah, right, so perhaps the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and we can use that to find allele frequencies.

So, let's denote p as the frequency of T allele, and q as the frequency of t allele (q = 1 - p).

In H-W equilibrium, the genotype frequencies are:

- TT: p²
- Tt: 2pq
- tt: q²

Now, the non-tasters are tt, so their frequency is q² = 41/146.

So, q² = 41/146. Let's compute that.

41 divided by 146: Let's calculate that.

41 ÷ 146 = approximately 0.2808. So q² ≈ 0.2808. So q is the square root of that. So sqrt(0.2808) is approximately 0.5299, which is about 0.53. So q ≈ 0.53, which is the frequency of allele t.

Then p, the frequency of T, would be 1 - q = 1 - 0.53 = 0.47.

So the allele frequencies are T at 0.47 and t at 0.53.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B says T is 0.47 and t is 0.53. Option F says T is 0.53 and t is 0.47. So which is correct?

Wait, I think I might have mixed up. Because non-tasters are tt, which are q². So q is the frequency of allele t. So if q² = 41/146 ≈ 0.2808, then q is sqrt(0.2808) ≈ 0.5299 or 0.53.

So allele t is at 0.53 frequency, and T is 1 - 0.53 = 0.47.

So the frequency of T is 0.47 and t is 0.53.

Looking at the options, option B says T is 0.47 and t is 0.53. So option B is the correct choice.

Wait, but earlier I thought the phenotypic frequencies were 0.72 and 0.28. But that's for tasters and non-tasters, not the allele frequencies. So the question must be about allele frequencies because the options correspond to that. So I must have misread the question initially.

Wait, the question says "calculate the frequencies of tasters and non-tasters." So that's phenotype frequencies. But if the options give allele frequencies, perhaps the question is actually asking for allele frequencies. Or maybe the question is misworded.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting confused between phenotype and genotype. Wait, perhaps the question is about genotype frequencies, but that's not what it says. Tasters and non-tasters are phenotypes.

Wait, but maybe the question is phrased incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the allele frequencies, given the phenotype data.

In any case, under Hardy-Weinberg, with non-tasters being q² = 41/146 ≈ 0.2808, so q ≈ 0.53, and p = 0.47.

So the allele frequencies are T=0.47 and t=0.53. So option B is correct.
</think>

To calculate the frequencies of tasters and non-tasters, we start by noting that 105 out of 146 students are tasters, and 41 are non-tasters. The question, however, asks for the frequencies of the alleles T (taster) and t (non-taster). Assuming the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, we can use the following relationships:

1. Let \( p \) represent the frequency of the T allele, and \( q \) represent the frequency of the t allele. By definition, \( p + q = 1 \).

2. The frequency of non-tasters (tt) is given by \( q^2 \). Since there are 41 non-tasters out of 146 students, we calculate:
   \[
   q^2 = \frac{41}{146} \approx 0.2808
   \]

3. Taking the square root to find \( q \), the frequency of the t allele:
   \[
   q = \sqrt{0.2808} \approx 0.53
   \]

4. The frequency of the T allele is then:
   \[
   p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.53 = 0.47
   \]

Thus, the frequency of the T allele is 0.47, and the frequency of the t allele is 0.53. Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**B: Frequency of T is 0.47 and frequency of t is 0.53.**
