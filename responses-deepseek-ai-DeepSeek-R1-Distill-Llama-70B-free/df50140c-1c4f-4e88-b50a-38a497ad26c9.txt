Question:

A man and a woman were involved in a car accident that occurred when the man abruptly switched lanes in front of the woman without signaling. Unable to stop, the woman hit the man's car into a median. Immediately after the accident, as the two drivers emerged from their vehicles, a pedestrian, obviously emotional and upset from having just observed an accident, ran up to the man and shouted, "You careless driver, you. Didn't you ever learn that you're supposed to use a turn signal when you switch lanes?" The pedestrian is never identified and is not present at trial. The pedestrian's statement is

Options:

A: inadmissible, because the bystander was not involved in the accident.
B: admissible, because it is relevant to the case.
C: admissible under the excited utterance exception.
D: admissible as non-hearsay.
E: admissible, even though it is hearsay.
F: admissible under the present sense impression exception.
G: inadmissible, because it is an opinion, not a fact.
H: inadmissible, because the bystander cannot be identified and is not present at trial.
I: inadmissible, because it is prejudicial to the defendant.
J: admissible under the spontaneous statement exception.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence law question. Let's see what the question is about. 

So, there's a car accident between a man and a woman. The man switched lanes without signaling, causing the woman to hit his car into a median. After the accident, a pedestrian comes up to the man and shouts, "You careless driver, you. Didn't you ever learn that you're supposed to use a turn signal when you switch lanes?" Now, this pedestrian isn't identified and isn't present at the trial. The question is about whether the pedestrian's statement is admissible.

Hmm, I remember that statements made by witnesses can sometimes be hearsay, which is generally inadmissible. But there are exceptions. Let me think about the hearsay exceptions.

One of the exceptions is the excited utterance, which is under FRE 803(2). That's when a statement is made in the heat of the moment, under stress or excitement caused by an event, and relates to that event. The idea is that people in such situations are less likely to lie because they're reacting spontaneously.

Another exception is the present sense impression, which is a statement describing an event made while the declarant is perceiving it or immediately thereafter. But I think this applies more when the person is recounting what's happening as they see it, not necessarily their opinion.

Also, there's the spontaneous statement or 'residual exception' sometimes, but I think that's more for when other exceptions don't apply but the statement still has high trustworthiness.

In this case, the pedestrian was obviously emotional and upset from just observing the accident. So, he ran up right after the accident and made that statement. It seems like he was under the stress of the event, so maybe it's an excited utterance.

Wait, but the statement is calling the man a careless driver and mentions not using a turn signal. So, is that statement factual or is it an opinion? Because if it's an opinion, maybe it's not admissible as fact. But wait, the statement is about the man's action (not signaling), which is a fact, but the "careless driver" part could be an opinion. Or maybe it's a statement of fact that he didn't signal, which led to the accident.

But in terms of hearsay, the pedestrian's statement is being offered to prove that the man was careless and didn't signal. So, the content is about the man's conduct, which is a fact. The statement is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth, so it's hearsay unless an exception applies.

So, the question is whether it falls under an exception. The pedestrian was upset and made the statement immediately after the accident. So, excited utterance. Because the statement was made under the stress of the event, so it's admissible as an excited utterance under 803(2).

Alternatively, maybe the present sense impression. But I think present sense impression is more for when the person is describing an event as it happens or immediately after, but not necessarily expressing an opinion. The pedestrian's statement is more of an accusation, so excited utterance seems to fit better.

Now, looking at the options:

Option C says admissible under the excited utterance exception.

Option D says admissible as non-hearsay. But wait, the statement is being offered for the truth of the matter, so it is hearsay. So D is incorrect because it's hearsay.

Option J is about spontaneous statement exception, which I think is similar to excited utterance but perhaps a different rule. Wait, no, excited utterance is a specific exception, so J might be a trick. Or maybe spontaneous statement is another term for excited utterance? I think excited utterance is the correct term here.

So the correct answer should be C.

Other options: A says inadmissible because bystander not involved. But that's not the issue; it's about hearsay, not about who said it. B says admissible because relevant, but relevance alone doesn't overcome hearsay. E says admissible even though hearsay, which would be correct if an exception applies, but the option doesn't specify the exception. So the better answer is C, which specifies the exception.

H says inadmissible because bystander can't be identified, but that's not the case. The statement can still be admissible under an exception even if the declarant isn't present. So H is not correct.

I says it's inadmissible because prejudicial, but that's not the main issue here. The statement's admissibility hinges on hearsay, not prejudice.

G says inadmissible because it's opinion, but the statement includes both opinion and fact. But I think the fact part is admissible under the exception, so G isn't correct.

So I think the correct answer is C.

The pedestrian's statement is being offered to prove that the man was careless and failed to use a turn signal, which are factual assertions about his conduct. This makes the statement hearsay because it is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted. However, hearsay is admissible if it falls under an exception.

The pedestrian was emotionally upset and made the statement immediately after witnessing the accident, which suggests it was made under the stress of the event. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) 803(2), this qualifies as an excited utterance, an exception to the hearsay rule. The statement was spontaneous and related to the event, making it admissible under this exception.

Other options are incorrect for the following reasons:
- **A**: Incorrect because the bystander's involvement is not the issue; the admissibility depends on hearsay exceptions.
- **B**: Incorrect because relevance alone does not overcome hearsay.
- **D**: Incorrect because the statement is hearsay, not non-hearsay.
- **E**: While technically correct that it is admissible as hearsay with an exception, it does not specify the exception, making it less precise than **C**.
- **F**: Incorrect because the statement is not a present sense impression; it is more of an accusation.
- **G**: Incorrect because the statement includes factual assertions, not just opinion.
- **H**: Incorrect because the declarant's absence does not bar admissibility under an exception.
- **I**: Incorrect because the statement's admissibility hinges on hearsay, not prejudice.
- **J**: Incorrect because "spontaneous statement" is not the specific exception that applies here; "excited utterance" is the correct term.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**, as the statement is admissible under the excited utterance exception.

Answer: C
