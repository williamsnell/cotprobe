Question:

Alice owned Greyacre, a one-acre piece of property, in fee simple. Alice sold the property to Barbara who moved into the only residence on the land. Barbara neglected to record the deed, and three years later, Alice conveyed the same property to Charlene who immediately filed the deed she received from Alice. Greyacre's jurisdiction has a race-notice statute and a tract index system. If an action is filed for title to the property, the likely outcome would be for

Options:

A: Alice, since her ownership was first in time and she was of record.
B: Barbara, because she was the first to record her deed.
C: Alice, since she made two valid sales of the same property.
D: Charlene, because she was the first to record her deed.
E: Barbara, due to her physical possession of the property.
F: Barbara, because Charlene had notice of the prior conveyance between Alice and Barbara.
G: Charlene, because she relied on Alice's representation of ownership.
H: Alice, as she never actually transferred the property rights.
I: Charlene, as Barbara did not officially record her deed.
J: Charlene, because she was the last to receive the deed from Alice.

Okay, so I've got this property law question to tackle, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand all the details.

So, Alice owns Greyacre, which is a one-acre property, and she holds it in fee simple. That means she has absolute ownership, right? Then she sells it to Barbara, who moves into the only residence there. But Barbara doesn't record the deed. Three years later, Alice conveys the same property to Charlene, and Charlene immediately files her deed. The jurisdiction has a race-notice statute and uses a tract index system. The question is about who would win if there's a dispute over the title.

Hmm, I remember that property recording statutes determine the priority of deeds when there are conflicting claims. There are a few types of recording statutes: race, notice, and race-notice. Each affects how the claims are prioritized.

In this case, the jurisdiction uses a race-notice statute. From what I recall, a race-notice statute requires that a deed be recorded in order to be valid against subsequent purchasers. Moreover, under race-notice, the subsequent purchaser must both record first and take without notice of the prior conveyance to have priority.

So let's break down the timeline:

1. Alice sells to Barbara. Barbara doesn't record her deed. So, as between Alice and Barbara, Barbara now owns the property because she has the deed, but she didn't record it.

2. Three years later, Alice sells the same property to Charlene. Charlene records her deed immediately. Now, the issue is whether Charlene has a better claim than Barbara.

Under a race-notice statute, Charlene would prevail if she recorded first and had no notice of Barbara's prior deed. But wait, Barbara didn't record, so when Charlene records, would she be considered to have notice?

Wait, no. Because Barbara didn't record, when Charlene takes the deed from Alice and records, she would have no notice of Barbara's deed since it's not recorded. Because in a tract index system, when someone records, they do a search based on the tract index, which lists properties, so if Barbara's deed isn't recorded, Charlene's title search wouldn't find it. Therefore, Charlene has no notice of Barbara's claim.

So under the race-notice statute, Charlene would be protected because she recorded first and had no notice. Wait, no—Barbara didn't record at all. So when Charlene records, she's the first to record. But does she have to be without notice of any prior unrecorded conveyances?

Wait, the race-notice statute requires that the subsequent purchaser (Charlene) must both record first and take without notice of the prior conveyance (Barbara's). 

In this case, Barbara didn't record, so when Charlene records, she may not have actual or constructive notice of Barbara's deed. Constructive notice would come from the records, which Charlene would have checked. Since Barbara didn't record, Charlene wouldn't have found anything in the records about Barbara's ownership. 

So Charlene, being a bona fide purchaser (BFP) who records first and takes without notice, would take priority over Barbara. Because Barbara didn't record, her deed isn't valid against a subsequent purchaser like Charlene who meets the race-notice requirements.

Wait, but what if the jurisdiction's tract index requires that a purchaser search under the names of the grantors and grantees? Let's think about that. In a tract index system, each property is indexed by the tract, so when Charlene does a title search, she looks up the property (Greyacre) and sees all the deeds related to it. If Barbara didn't record, then Charlene's search wouldn't find Barbara's deed because it's not in the records. So Charlene would have no notice, whether actual or constructive.

Therefore, Charlene's recording would be first, and she has no notice, so under the race-notice statute, Charlene's deed would have priority over Barbara's.

Let me look at the options again.

Option D: Charlene, because she was the first to record her deed.

Option I: Charlene, as Barbara did not officially record her deed.

Wait, both D and I suggest Charlene wins. But why the difference in reasoning?

Option D says because she was first to record. Option I says because Barbara didn't record.

In race-notice, the key is that the subsequent purchaser (Charlene) must record first and take without notice. So Charlene's recording is first in time (since Barbara didn't record at all), and she had no notice.

So the correct reasoning would be that Charlene recorded first and without notice. So both D and I touch on that, but perhaps the better answer is I, because it's about Barbara not recording, which affects the outcome. Or maybe D is correct because Charlene was first to record.

Wait, perhaps the reason is that in a race-notice, the subsequent purchaser (Charlene) must have recorded first and without notice. So since Charlene recorded first (and Barbara didn't record at all), Charlene's deed is protected.

So looking at the options:

Option D says Charlene because she was first to record. That's correct.

Option I says Charlene because Barbara didn't record. That's also correct, but perhaps D is more precise.

Wait, but the reason isn't just that Barbara didn't record, but that Charlene recorded first and without notice. So perhaps both factors are involved.

Alternatively, is there another aspect? Like, since Barbara didn't record, her deed isn't valid against Charlene, a subsequent BFP.

Wait, in a race-notice state, a prior unrecorded conveyance is invalid against a subsequent purchaser who (1) pays value, (2) records first, and (3) takes without notice.

Here, Charlene is a subsequent purchaser from Alice. Alice's deed to Charlene is recorded first because Barbara didn't record hers. So whether Charlene wins because she recorded first.

But, in this scenario, it's possible that Charlene is a BFP because she had no notice (since Barbara didn't record) and she paid value and recorded promptly. So she takes free of Barbara's unrecorded deed.

So the correct answer would be that Charlene wins because she recorded first and without notice. So looking at the options again.

Option D: Charlene, because she was the first to record her deed.

Option I: Charlene, as Barbara did not officially record her deed.

So either D or I could be correct, but perhaps I is more accurate because it's about the failure to record by Barbara. Or D is correct because Charlene's recording is first.

Wait, I think the key is that in race-notice, the subsequent purchaser must record first and have no notice. Since Barbara didn't record, Charlene's recording is first, making her the winner.

So the correct answer is D: Charlene, because she was the first to record her deed.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I says "as Barbara did not officially record her deed." That also seems correct because if Barbara had recorded, she would have had priority. So which one is more accurate?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct reasoning is that under a race-notice statute, Charlene wins because she recorded first and without notice. So the fact that Barbara didn't record is why Charlene didn't have notice.

So perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the correct answer might be I because it's the reason why Charlene wins—Barbara's failure to record.

Wait, the question is about who has the better title. So when Alice sold to Barbara, Barbara didn't record. Then Alice sold to Charlene, who recorded. Under the race-notice statute, Charlene would prevail because she recorded first and had no notice. So the fact that Barbara didn't record is crucial because it means she didn't provide constructive notice to Charlene.

So the correct answer would be that Charlene wins because Barbara didn't record, making option I correct. Alternatively, D is correct because Charlene recorded first.

Wait, but the race-notice requires that the subsequent purchaser (Charlene) must both record first and take without notice. So Charlene's recording is first in the race, and she had no notice because Barbara didn't record. So both conditions are met.

Therefore, the correct answer would be D: Charlene, because she was the first to record her deed.

Alternatively, perhaps I is correct because it's about Barbara's failure to record, which allowed Charlene to take without notice. But I think the more precise answer is D because it's about Charlene's recording being first.

Wait, but another point: in some jurisdictions, the recording must be timely. Here, Charlene recorded immediately, so that's good.

So I'm a bit stuck between options D and I. Let me think again. The race-notice statute says that the later purchaser (Charlene) must record before the earlier purchaser (Barbara) and must have no notice. Since Barbara didn't record, Charlene's recording is first, and she has no notice. So Charlene wins because she recorded first.

But another way: Barbara's failure to record means her deed is invalid against Charlene, a subsequent BFP. So the reason is Barbara didn't record, making option I correct.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to recall: in a race-notice state, the subsequent BFP will win if they record first and without notice. So the key factors are that Charlene recorded first (since Barbara didn't) and had no notice (because Barbara didn't record, so constructive notice isn't present). So the correct answer would be I: Charlene, as Barbara did not officially record her deed.

Wait, but option I says "as Barbara did not officially record her deed." So yes, that's correct because without Barbara's recording, Charlene takes priority.

So now I'm leaning towards option I.

Wait, but let me check the answer options again. Option D says "because she was the first to record her deed." That's true, but the reason she was first is because Barbara didn't record. So both factors are present.

But the question is about the likely outcome. So the outcome is that Charlene wins because she recorded first, but the reason is that Barbara didn't record. So the correct answer would be D, but I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D because the fact that Charlene recorded first is the determining factor, regardless of why Barbara didn't. But I'm not sure.

Wait, to clarify: in a race-notice state, the recording acts protect a subsequent BFP who records first without notice. So the priority is determined by the order of recording, provided the subsequent purchaser had no notice.

So in this case, Barbara didn't record, so when Charlene records, she's first, and she didn't have notice. So Charlene wins because she's the first to record, making option D correct.

So, I think the correct answer is D: Charlene, because she was the first to record her deed.

Wait, but earlier I thought it's because Barbara didn't record, which is option I. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options again, option D says 'first to record,' which is the case because Barbara's deed wasn't recorded. So D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is I because it's about Barbara not recording, which is the reason Charlene wins. But the reasoning in the statute is about the order of recording and notice.

I think I'm getting stuck here, but I'll go with option I as the correct answer because it's the reason why Charlene takes priority—Barbara didn't record, so her deed isn't valid against Charlene, who recorded. So option I is correct.
</think>

In this scenario, Alice sold Greyacre to Barbara, who did not record her deed. Later, Alice sold the same property to Charlene, who promptly recorded her deed. The jurisdiction follows a race-notice statute, which requires that a subsequent purchaser must record their deed first and take without notice of any prior unrecorded conveyance to have priority.

Key points:

1. **Race-Notice Statute**: Under this statute, a subsequent purchaser (Charlene) is protected if they record their deed first and take without notice of any prior unrecorded conveyance (Barbara's deed in this case).

2. **Barbara's Failure to Record**: Since Barbara did not record her deed, Charlene had no constructive notice of Barbara's claim. Constructive notice is typically derived from the public records, and since Barbara's deed was not recorded, Charlene's title search would not have revealed it.

3. **Charlene's Actions**: Charlene recorded her deed immediately after purchasing the property. This makes her the first to record, satisfying the "race" requirement of the race-notice statute. Additionally, Charlene took the property without notice of Barbara's prior conveyance, satisfying the "notice" requirement.

4. **Outcome**: Because Charlene recorded first and had no notice of Barbara's unrecorded deed, Charlene's claim to the property takes priority under the race-notice statute. The failure of Barbara to record her deed is the critical factor that allows Charlene to prevail.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option D**: "Charlene, because she was the first to record her deed." This is correct because Charlene recorded first, satisfying the race requirement.
- **Option I**: "Charlene, as Barbara did not officially record her deed." This is also correct because Barbara's failure to record is why Charlene was able to take priority.

While both options are accurate, the more precise reasoning is that Charlene wins because she recorded first and without notice, making **Option D** the better choice.
