Okay, so I've got this problem about the combustion of methane and I'm supposed to find the maximum temperatures for both constant volume and constant pressure processes. Hmm. I remember that the heat of combustion is involved here. The problem gives me the heat of combustion for one mole of CH4, which is 48,418.7 kcal/mole. Wait, but wait, I think the heat of combustion is usually exothermic, so it's negative in terms of enthalpy change. Oh right, because combustion releases heat.

So the reaction given is (1/2)CH4 + O2 + 3.76N2 → (1/2)CO2 + H2O + 3.76N2. Oh, wait, the stoichiometric amounts. Since it's methane reacting with air, which is O2 and N2. The N2 is inert here, so it doesn't participate in the reaction, it's just a spectator.

The question says the process can be either constant volume or constant pressure. Since the initial conditions are STP, I need to figure out the initial moles and then calculate the heat released, which will determine the temperature change.

Wait, but first, I should write down the balanced equation. Let's see, the given equation is for 1/2 mole of CH4. So maybe it's easier to write it for 1 mole. Let's multiply everything by 2 to avoid fractions.

So 2*(1/2 CH4 + O2 + 3.76 N2 → 1/2 CO2 + H2O + 3.76 N2) gives:

CH4 + 2O2 + 7.52 N2 → CO2 + 2 H2O +7.52 N2.

Wait no, because 3.76 times 2 is 7.52, but for the reaction as written, let me check: the original equation has 1/2 CH4, so when multiplied by 2, it's CH4 + 2 O2 + (3.76*2) N2 → CO2 + 2 H2O + same N2.

Wait, but I think the given reaction is already balanced. Let's see: on the reactant side, (1/2)CH4 + O2 + 3.76 N2. Products: (1/2)CO2 + H2O + 3.76 N2. Oh wait, H2O is present as liquid? Because the heat of combustion is usually for products as liquid water. Hmm, important because the enthalpy change would be different if H2O is gas or liquid.

Wait, the question says the heat of combustion is for one mole of CH4 burned, which is 48,418.7 kcal/mol. So for the reaction as written, which uses 1/2 mole of CH4, the heat released would be half that, so 24,209.35 kcal. But wait, heat of combustion is exothermic, so it's negative, right? So for the reaction as written, the enthalpy change ΔH would be -24,209.35 kcal. But wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again. The heat of combustion is the heat released when one mole of fuel is burned completely in oxygen under standard conditions. So yes, for the reaction as written, which uses 1/2 mole CH4, the ΔH would be – (48,418.7 / 2) = –24,209.35 kcal.

But wait, the problem states that the heat of combustion is 48,418.7 kcal per mole of CH4. So per mole, which is the standard way. So for the reaction as given (1/2 mole CH4), the total heat released would be (1/2)*(-48418.7 kcal/mol). So that's for the reaction as written.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me start over. The reaction is (1/2) CH4 + O2 + 3.76 N2 → (1/2) CO2 + H2O + 3.76 N2. So this is CH4 burning with stoichiometric air (since 3.76 is the approximate moles of N2 per mole O2 in air). So the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio is correct here.

Now, the problem says to calculate the maximum temperatures for constant volume and constant pressure. So I think for this, we can model it as the heat released going into the products, heating them up. So the approach is to calculate the heat released (which is the enthalpy change of combustion) and then use that to find the temperature rise, considering the heat capacities of the products.

Wait, but first, I need to find the total moles of products, and their heat capacities, to compute the temperature change.

Wait, since the process is adiabatic (I assume, because maximum temperature is achieved when all heat goes into heating the products), the heat released by combustion (q) is equal to the sum of the heat capacities of the products multiplied by the temperature change.

But wait, in constant volume and constant pressure processes, the calculation differs. Oh right, because for constant volume, it's the internal energy that changes (ΔU = q), whereas for constant pressure, it's the enthalpy (ΔH = q). Wait, no, because in the case of maximum temperature, the heat is transferred to the products, so perhaps the approach is to compute the temperature based on the heat released and the heat capacities.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this using the first law of thermodynamics. For an adiabatic process (no heat exchange with environment), the heat released by the reaction is absorbed by the products, raising their temperature.

But wait, in reality, the reaction itself releases heat which is then used to heat the products. So the heat of combustion (at constant pressure) is the enthalpy change, Q_p. But for a constant volume process, the heat is Q_v, which is the change in internal energy (ΔU). So to compute the maximum temperature, I need to compute the heat released and then use the appropriate heat capacities.

Wait, but for maximum temperature, perhaps we can assume that all the heat from combustion is used to heat the products, with no losses. So the approach is:

1. Calculate the heat released during combustion, Q.

2. Calculate the total heat capacity of the products.

3. Use Q = C_total * ΔT, so ΔT = Q / C_total, and then add this to the initial temperature.

Wait, but the initial temperature is STP, which is 0°C or 273.15 K. So the final temperature is 273.15 + ΔT.

But I need to compute Q for both constant volume and constant pressure processes.

Wait, but for this, I think the heat released (Q) is different for the two processes. Because at constant volume, Q_v is the change in internal energy (ΔU), and at constant pressure, Q_p is the change in enthalpy (ΔH). So the same reaction will release different amounts of heat depending on the process.

Wait, but the problem states that the heat of combustion is given as 48,418.7 kcal per mole of CH4. I think that value is the standard enthalpy of combustion, which is measured at constant pressure. So that's ΔH for the reaction.

Hmm. So when the reaction occurs at constant pressure, the heat released is Q_p = ΔH = - (1/2)*48418.7 kcal, because the reaction as written uses 1/2 mole CH4. So, since it's exothermic, Q_p is negative, but we're interested in the magnitude for heating.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me structure this.

Given:

Reaction: (1/2) CH4 + O2 + 3.76 N2 → (1/2) CO2 + H2O + 3.76 N2

Heat of combustion: ΔH_comb = -48,418.7 kcal/mol CH4.

So for 1/2 mole CH4, ΔH = (1/2)*(-48,418.7) = -24,209.35 kcal.

But wait, when the process is at constant pressure, the heat released is Q_p = ΔH. So that's -24,209.35 kcal. But this heat is used to raise the temperature of the products.

Wait, no. Because in a combustion process, the heat released is what's causing the temperature increase. So the negative sign indicates exothermic, but the magnitude is what contributes to heating.

So, for the constant pressure case, the heat Q is equal to ΔH, which is negative, but the products absorb the heat, so their temperature increases.

Similarly, for the constant volume case, the heat released Q is ΔU, which is Q_v = ΔU.

So I need to compute ΔH and ΔU for the reaction as written, then use those to find the temperature change.

But wait, the problem says to assume that specific heats are constant. So I can use the heat capacities at constant pressure (Cp) and constant volume (Cv) for each product.

So the steps I think are:

1. Write the balanced reaction for 1 mole of CH4.

2. Calculate the total moles of gaseous products.

3. For each product, determine their Cp and Cv values.

4. Calculate the total heat capacity for the products for both constant pressure (sum of Cp) and constant volume (sum of Cv).

5. Use the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the reaction to find the temperature increase at constant pressure.

6. Use the internal energy change (ΔU) for the reaction to find the temperature increase at constant volume.

Wait, but wait, the reaction as given uses 1/2 mole CH4. So for 1 mole CH4, I need to adjust the reaction. Let me do that.

Reaction for 1 mole CH4:

CH4 + 2 O2 → CO2 + 2 H2O

But wait, including the nitrogen, which is inert. So:

CH4 + 2 O2 + 7.52 N2 → CO2 + 2 H2O + 7.52 N2.

So for 1 mole of CH4, the products are 1 mole CO2, 2 moles H2O, and 7.52 moles N2.

Wait, but H2O is a liquid or gas? The problem doesn't specify, but the heat of combustion is given, which I think is for liquid water. Because standard heats of combustion are usually for the most stable form of the products. So if H2O is liquid, then its heat capacity would be different. Hmm, but that complicates things because Cp for liquid H2O is around 1 cal/(mol·K), while for gas it's higher, like 8 or so.

Wait, this is a crucial point. Because if H2O is liquid, then in the reaction, the products include liquid H2O, which would have a lower heat capacity. But the problem statement says that the initial substances are at STP, so I'm not sure about the state of H2O in the products. Alternatively, perhaps the combustion is considered to produce gaseous H2O, but that would change the enthalpy. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem states that the specific heats are constant in the temperature range of interest, but it doesn't specify the states. So perhaps I should check standard assumptions. In combustion problems, sometimes H2O is considered as gas, but in standard enthalpy of combustion, it's usually liquid. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem gives the heat of combustion as 48,418.7 kcal/mol, which is likely for producing liquid H2O. Because I remember that the standard enthalpy of combustion for methane is about -890.4 kJ/mol (which is about -212.1 kcal/mol), but wait, no, wait, wait. Wait, 48,418.7 kcal/mol is way higher than that. Wait, hold on, 1 mole is 16 g, and the standard enthalpy of combustion for methane is about 55.5 MJ/kg, which is 55,500 J/mol, which is 13.23 kcal/g *16g= 211.7 kcal/mol. But the value given is 48,418.7 kcal/mol, which is way higher. So that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, no, the value given is 48,418.7 kcal per mole of CH4. That's 48,418.7 * 4.184 = about 202,500 kJ per mole. That seems extremely high. Wait, perhaps the value is wrong, but assuming it's correct as per the problem, perhaps it's in different units. Alternatively, maybe it's 48,418.7 kJ/mol, which would make more sense, but the question says kcal.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between kJ and kcal. Let me compute 48,418.7 kcal to kJ. 1 kcal is 4.184 kJ, so 48,418.7 *4.184 ≈ 202,500 kJ/mol. That's way higher than standard. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement, but I'll proceed with the given value.

So, back to the problem. The heat of combustion is given, and for the reaction as written (1/2 mole CH4), the heat released would be 24,209.35 kcal (since it's half a mole). But I'm not sure if this is ΔH or ΔU. Wait, the problem says it's the heat of combustion for one mole, which is typically ΔH_comb at constant pressure. So for the reaction as written (1/2 mole), ΔH would be (1/2)*(-48418.7) kcal.

Wait, but when the process is at constant pressure, the heat Q_p is equal to ΔH. So Q_p = -24,209.35 kcal. But since the system is releasing heat, the products will absorb this heat to raise their temperature. So the magnitude is 24,209.35 kcal.

Similarly, for the constant volume process, Q_v would be ΔU. But ΔU = ΔH - Δ(PV). For an ideal gas, Δ(PV) = Δ(nRT). So for the reaction, the change in moles of gas (Δn) would affect ΔU.

So, for the reaction as written (1/2 mole CH4):

Reactants: (1/2) CH4 + 1 O2 + 3.76 N2.

Moles of gas on reactant side: 0.5 + 1 + 3.76 = 5.26 moles.

Products: (1/2) CO2 + H2O (assumed liquid?) + 3.76 N2.

If H2O is liquid, then moles of gas in products: 0.5 + 3.76 = 4.26 moles.

So Δn = 4.26 - 5.26 = -1 mole.

So, for the reaction as written, Δn = -1 mole.

Thus, ΔU = ΔH - Δn_gas * R * T.

Wait, but wait, at what temperature? Well, I think for the calculation of ΔU from ΔH, the temperature is standard temperature, which is 25°C or 298 K.

So, R is 1.987 cal/(mol·K), approximately 2 cal/(mol·K).

So, ΔU = ΔH - (Δn) * R * T.

Wait, but wait, the general formula is ΔU = ΔH - Δn_gas * R T.

Wait, because ΔH = ΔU + Δ(PV), and for ideal gases, PV = nRT, so Δ(PV) = Δn RT. So, ΔH = ΔU + Δn RT, so ΔU = ΔH - Δn RT.

So, for the reaction as written, Δn = (moles of gaseous products) - (moles of gaseous reactants).

In the reaction as written, the reactants are 0.5 CH4, 1 O2, and 3.76 N2, all gases. The products are 0.5 CO2 (gas), H2O (liquid, so not counted), and 3.76 N2 (gas).

So moles of gas in reactants: 0.5 + 1 + 3.76 = 5.26.

Moles of gas in products: 0.5 + 3.76 = 4.26.

So Δn = 4.26 - 5.26 = -1 mole.

So ΔU = ΔH - (Δn) * R * T.

ΔH is given as -24,209.35 kcal for the reaction as written (1/2 mole CH4). So in cal, that's -24,209.35 * 1000 = -24,209,350 cal.

Wait, no, wait: 1 kcal = 1000 cal. So 24,209.35 kcal = 24,209,350 cal.

Wait, but the ΔH is negative because it's exothermic. So ΔH = -24,209,350 cal.

Δn = -1 mole.

R is 1.987 cal/(mol·K).

Standard temperature is 273.15 K + 25 = 298.15 K, approximately 298 K.

So ΔU = ΔH - (Δn) * R * T.

Plugging in the numbers:

ΔU = (-24,209,350) - (-1) * 1.987 * 298.

Compute the second term: 1 * 1.987 * 298 ≈ 1.987 * 300 ≈ 596.1 cal (exact: 1.987 * 298 = approx 592.4 cal).

So ΔU ≈ -24,209,350 + 592.4 = -24,208,757.6 cal.

So approximately, ΔU is about -24,208,758 cal.

Wait, but that's a very small change compared to the overall value. So, perhaps for the purposes of this problem, the difference between ΔH and ΔU is negligible. But I'm not sure; I'll proceed with both values.

Now, the next step is to find the heat released in each process.

For constant pressure: Q_p = ΔH = -24,209,350 cal.

But since the heat is released, the products will absorb 24,209,350 cal.

For constant volume: Q_v = ΔU = -24,208,758 cal, so the products absorb 24,208,758 cal.

Wait, but the problem says to calculate the maximum temperature for each process. So for each case, we can compute the temperature increase by dividing the heat by the total heat capacity of the products.

But first, I need to find the moles of each product and their respective heat capacities.

So, considering the reaction for 1/2 mole CH4:

Products are 1/2 CO2, H2O (liquid), and 3.76
