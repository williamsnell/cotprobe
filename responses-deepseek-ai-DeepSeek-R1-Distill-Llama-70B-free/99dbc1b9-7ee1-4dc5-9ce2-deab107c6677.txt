Okay, so I've got this question about the color of an airplane's black box. Hmm, I remember hearing that the black box isn't actually black. Wait, why do they call it black then? Maybe it's a nickname. Let me think. I think the real reason is that the term "black box" comes from the early days when these recorders were actually black, but now they're different colors.

Wait, no, I think I heard somewhere that they're bright colors to make them easier to find after a crash. Oh right, because if they're in the water or wreckage, a bright color stands out more. So what color is it? I remember orange being a common color for things that need to be visible, like life jackets or construction cones. So maybe the black box is orange. 

But wait, could it be another color like yellow or red? I'm trying to recall. I think I saw a documentary where they showed the black box being retrieved, and it was orange. Also, the term "orange box" doesn't stick, so they still call it black. Yeah, that makes sense because orange is easier to spot. So the answer should be H: orange.

The black box is actually orange to make it easier to locate after an accident.
