Question:

This question refers to the following information.
That day the Reverend Xuanzang was chosen from among all the monks. He had been a monk from infancy, and ever since birth he had eaten vegetarian food and observed the prohibitions. His maternal grandfather was an imperial commander, Yin Kaishan. His father Chen Guangrui had come top in the Palace Examination and had been appointed a grand secretary in the Imperial Library. Xuanzang, however, had no interest in honour and glory, and his only joy was to cultivate Nirvana. His virtue was great; of the thousand sutras and ten thousand holy books there was not a single one that he did not know.
â€¦
He looked to the West and prayed, "I am the believer Chen Xuanzang sent on imperial orders to fetch the scriptures. If I am fated to have a disciple, may I be able to unseal the golden words and release the divine Monkey King to come with me to the Vulture Peak. If I am not fated to have a disciple, and this monkey is an evil monster who has deceived me and will do me no good, then may I be unable to remove the seal." When he had prayed he bowed again.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about how the given excerpt complicates historians' understanding of Xuanzang's career. The excerpt is from "Journey to the West" by Wu Chengen, written in the 1590s. So, Xuanzang is a real historical figure, but here he's portrayed in a fictional context.

I remember that Xuanzang was a real monk who traveled to India to fetch Buddhist scriptures. He's famous for his journeys and translations, which are well-documented historically. However, "Journey to the West" is a novel, a work of fiction that includes fantastical elements and characters like the Monkey King. So, the story in the novel is not meant to be a historical account but rather a fictionalized version of his journey.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A says it highly fictionalizes his accomplishments. That makes sense because the novel adds mythical elements, which would make it harder for historians to separate fact from fiction. Historians rely on accurate records, so if a popular source like this novel adds fictional layers, it complicates understanding his real career.

Option B mentions it was written long after his time. That's true; Xuanzang lived in the 7th century, and the novel was written in the late 16th century. But wait, the question is about how it complicates understanding, not just when it was written. While the time gap is relevant, the key issue is the fictionalization rather than just the timing.

Option C suggests it casts doubt on his existence. But Xuanzang is well-documented in historical records, so the novel doesn't make historians doubt he existed. They know he was real, so this option doesn't fit.

Option D says it's considered a forgery. I don't think that's the case. The novel is a work of fiction, not a forgery pretending to be a historical text. So this option doesn't apply.

So, the main issue is that the novel fictionalizes Xuanzang's story, making it harder for historians to discern the real events from the myths. Therefore, the correct answer should be A.

The excerpt from "Journey to the West" complicates historians' understanding of Xuanzang's career because it highly fictionalizes his story, adding mythical elements like the Monkey King. This makes it difficult to separate historical facts from fiction, despite Xuanzang being a well-documented figure. 

Answer: A
