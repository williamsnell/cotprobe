Okay, so I need to figure out the principal difference between Hobbes and Locke's positions. I remember both were philosophers who talked about social contracts and the state of nature, but their views were quite different.

Hobbes, if I recall correctly, believed that the state of nature was a war of "all against all." Life was solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short. Without a strong central authority, people couldn't really have order. So he thought that people would give up their rights to a sovereign to escape this chaos. The sovereign would have absolute power, and people wouldn't have the right to rebel, even if the sovereign was bad.

Locke, on the other hand, had a more optimistic view of the state of nature. He thought that people were generally rational and could cooperate. The state of nature for Locke was a state of freedom and equality, where people could own property and defend their rights. But because there was no common authority to resolve disputes, people would agree to form a government to protect their natural rightsâ€”like life, liberty, and property. Locke also believed in the right to revolt if the government failed to protect these rights.

So the main difference seems to be their accounts of life before the social contract. Hobbes saw it as chaotic and dangerous, necessitating a strong, absolute government. Locke saw it as more peaceful and based on mutual respect, allowing for a limited government that could be overthrown if it became tyrannical.

Looking at the options:

A: Different attitudes towards courts and order. I don't think that's the main point. Both might agree courts are important, but their focus is more on the state of nature and government structure.

B: Role of law in society. Again, maybe, but the key difference is about the state before the contract.

C: Contractual obligations. They both use the idea of a social contract, but their views on what the contract entails differ. But the question is about the principal difference, which I think is more about the state of nature.

D: Their account of life before the social contract. That fits what I was thinking. Hobbes's state of nature was much harsher than Locke's.

So the answer should be D.

The principal difference between Hobbes and Locke lies in their accounts of life before the social contract. Hobbes described the state of nature as chaotic, violent, and inherently dangerous, necessitating the establishment of a strong, absolute sovereign to maintain order. Locke, in contrast, viewed the state of nature as one of freedom, equality, and cooperation, where individuals could own property and resolve disputes rationally. Locke's state of nature was more peaceful, and he advocated for a limited government that protected natural rights and could be overthrown if it became tyrannical.

Option D correctly captures this difference, as it directly addresses their contrasting views on the state of nature before the social contract.

Answer: D
