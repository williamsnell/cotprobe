Okay, so I've got this question about capacitors and impedance. Hmm, I remember that impedance for a capacitor is given by some formula. Let me think... Oh right, I think it's Z = 1/(ωC), where ω is the angular frequency and C is the capacitance.

The question says the capacitor is 1 microfarad. Oh wait, micro is 10^-6, so C is 1e-6 farads. And the frequencies given are 100, 1000, and 10,000 rad/sec. I need to find the impedance for each.

So for each ω, I'll calculate 1 divided by (ω multiplied by 1e-6). Let me do each one step by step.

First, ω = 100 rad/s. So Z = 1/(100 * 1e-6) = 1/(1e-4) = 10,000 ohms? Wait, that can't be right. Because as frequency increases, impedance decreases for capacitors. Oh wait, wait, no: wait, no, wait. Wait, when the frequency is higher, the denominator gets bigger, so Z gets smaller. Oh right, so when ω is higher, Z is lower.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Capacitive impedance is Z = 1/(jωC). The magnitude is 1/(ωC). So with higher ω, smaller magnitude. So yes, higher ω means lower impedance.

So let me recalculate:

At 100 rad/s: Z = 1/(100 * 1e-6) = 1/(1e-4) = 10,000 ohms? No, wait 100 * 1e-6 is 0.0001, so 1/0.0001 is 10,000. So Z is 10,000 ohms.

Wait, but that seems high. Let me see the options. Looking at the options, option J is 10,000, 1000, 100. Option F is 15915, 1591.5, 159.15. Hmm, maybe I'm forgetting something. Oh wait, maybe it's the formula with 2πf, but wait, no, ω is already given as the angular frequency, which is 2π times the regular frequency. So the formula uses ω, so I'm correct.

Wait, but the options don't have 10000 as the first value except option J, which is 10,000, 1000, 100. Let's check the other values.

Next, ω = 1000 rad/s: Z = 1/(1000 * 1e-6) = 1/(0.001) = 1000 ohms.

Third, ω = 10,000 rad/s: Z = 1/(10,000 * 1e-6) = 1/(0.01) = 100 ohms.

So the impedance values are 10,000, 1000, 100 ohms respectively. Looking at the options, which one matches this?

Option J: 10,000, 1000, 100. Yes, that matches. So the answer should be option J.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. 1e-6 * 100 = 1e-4, reciprocal is 1e4 which is 10,000. Yep. 1e-6 * 1000 is 0.001, reciprocal 1000. 1e-6 * 1e4 is 0.01, reciprocal 100. So yes, J is correct.

The impedance of a capacitor is given by the formula:

\[
Z = \frac{1}{\omega C}
\]

where \( \omega \) is the angular frequency (in rad/s) and \( C \) is the capacitance (in farads). For a 1-\(\mu\)F capacitor (\( C = 1 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{F} \)), the impedance at the given angular frequencies can be calculated as follows:

1. **At \( \omega = 100 \, \text{rad/s} \):**
   \[
   Z = \frac{1}{100 \times 10^{-6}} = \frac{1}{10^{-4}} = 10,000 \, \Omega
   \]

2. **At \( \omega = 1000 \, \text{rad/s} \):**
   \[
   Z = \frac{1}{1000 \times 10^{-6}} = \frac{1}{10^{-3}} = 1000 \, \Omega
   \]

3. **At \( \omega = 10,000 \, \text{rad/s} \):**
   \[
   Z = \frac{1}{10,000 \times 10^{-6}} = \frac{1}{10^{-2}} = 100 \, \Omega
   \]

Thus, the impedance values are \( 10,000 \, \Omega \), \( 1000 \, \Omega \), and \( 100 \, \Omega \) for the angular frequencies of \( 100 \, \text{rad/s} \), \( 1000 \, \text{rad/s} \), and \( 10,000 \, \text{rad/s} \), respectively.

From the given options, the correct match is:

**J: 10,000 ohms, 1000 ohms, 100 ohms.**
