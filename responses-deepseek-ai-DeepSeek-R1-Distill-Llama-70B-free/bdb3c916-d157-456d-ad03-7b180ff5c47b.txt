Okay, so I've got this question about accounting terms, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is asking about the difference between assets and liabilities. I remember that in accounting, there are a few key terms that relate to this, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact definitions.

Let me start by recalling what assets and liabilities are. Assets are things a company owns that have value, like cash, buildings, or equipment. Liabilities are what the company owes, like loans or accounts payable. So the difference between them would be some measure that shows what's left after liabilities are subtracted from assets.

I think the term for this might be something like "owner's equity" or "net worth." Oh wait, I remember that the accounting equation is Assets = Liabilities + Equity. So equity is the part that's left after subtracting liabilities from assets. So the difference between assets and liabilities is equity, right?

Looking at the options, option E is "net worth" and option G is "capital or owner's equity." Hmm, sometimes net worth is used interchangeably with owner's equity. So which one is the correct answer here?

Wait, the question is asking for the difference between assets and liabilities. So mathematically, that's Assets minus Liabilities, which equals Equity. So the term should be equity. But looking at the options, E is net worth and G is capital or owner's equity. So which one is the exact term used for this difference?

I think in some contexts, net worth refers to the same thing as equity. Like, a company's net worth is its equity. So both E and G could be correct, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The options are A to J.

Option E is net worth, which I believe is another term for equity. Option G is capital or owner's equity. So maybe both E and G are correct, but looking at the options, I have to choose one.

Wait, another thought: the term "net worth" is often used for individuals, while businesses use equity or owner's equity. But in accounting, sometimes they refer to it as net worth for the company as well. So maybe both are acceptable, but in the context of this question, which one is correct?

Looking back at the options, I remember that the term "owner's equity" is the result of assets minus liabilities. So the difference between assets and liabilities is owner's equity, which is option G. Alternatively, net worth (option E) is also a term that could fit.

Wait, but I think the more precise term used in accounting for the difference is owner's equity or capital. So the correct answer would be G. But I'm a bit confused because I've heard net worth used in the same way.

Alternatively, maybe the question refers to "net worth" as the correct answer. Let me think of examples. When someone talks about a company's net worth, they mean the value of the company after subtracting all liabilities from assets. So that would be the same as equity.

So I'm a bit torn between E and G, but I think both could be correct. However, looking at the options, G is "capital or owner's equity," which directly refers to the accounting term. E is "net worth," which is more of a general term.

I think in the context of this question, the correct answer is E: net worth. Because net worth is the commonly understood term for the difference between assets and liabilities. But wait, I'm getting confused because I remember that the accounting equation is Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity. So the difference is Owner's Equity, which is option G.

Wait, no. Because the question is phrased as "the difference between assets and liabilities called?" So Assets minus Liabilities equals Equity. So the term for that is equity, which is option G.

But then why is option E there? Because net worth is another term for equity. So perhaps both E and G are correct, but I need to see which one is the exact term used in the options.

Wait, looking back at the options, option G says "capital or owner's equity," which is more specific. Option E is "net worth." I think in the context of the question, the answer is E: net worth. Because when people talk about the difference, they often say net worth.

Alternatively, maybe it's G. I'm a bit stuck, but I'll go with E: net worth because that's the term I've heard more commonly used for the difference.

The question asks for the term that represents the difference between assets and liabilities. Assets are resources a company owns, while liabilities are its debts. The difference between these two is calculated as Assets minus Liabilities, which equals Equity. In accounting, this is often referred to as "owner's equity" or "capital." 

Option G, "capital or owner's equity," directly corresponds to this accounting term. On the other hand, Option E, "net worth," is a more general term that can also represent the same concept. While both terms are related, "owner's equity" is the precise accounting term for the difference between assets and liabilities.

Answer: G
