Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a pinhole camera, and I'm a bit nervous because I don't remember all the details. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says that the sensitive plate is 20 cm from the pinhole. I need to find the diameter of the pinhole using Abney's formula. The film is most sensitive at 450 nm. Hmm, I remember that Abney's formula relates the pinhole diameter to the distance from the pinhole to the film, and it involves the wavelength of light.

Wait, what's Abney's formula again? I think it's something like d = (2.4 * λ * f)^(1/2), but I'm not entirely sure. Or was it a different coefficient? Oh wait, I think the coefficient might be different. Maybe it's 0.57? Because sometimes I've heard that the optimal pinhole diameter is calculated using a factor around 0.57 multiplied by the square root of the focal length in mm times the wavelength in nm. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, no, I think the formula is d = (f * λ)^(1/2), but scaled by some factor. Alternatively, another version I remember is d = (2.44 * λ * f)^(1/3). Wait, that doesn't sound right. Oh wait, perhaps the correct formula is d = (f * λ)^(1/2) multiplied by a certain factor.

Wait, maybe I should look up Abney's formula. Oh wait, I can't actually look it up right now, but I'll try to recall. Abney's formula is for the optimal pinhole diameter, which is supposed to balance diffraction and geometric sharpness. The formula, I think, is d = (2.44 * λ * f)^(1/2), but wait, that doesn't seem right because the units might not match. Or maybe it's d = (λ * f)^(1/2), but with a scaling factor.

Wait, another thought: I've heard that the optimal pinhole diameter is often calculated as the square root of (f times λ), multiplied by a coefficient. Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d = (1.5 * λ * f)^(1/2). But I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think about the units to get this right.

So, the focal length f is given in centimeters. Wait, no, the problem states that the distance is 20 cm, so that's the focal length. But in Abney's formula, I think the focal length is in the same unit as the wavelength, or perhaps meters. Hmm.

Wait, let me get this straight. The wavelength λ is given as 450 nm, which is 450 nanometers. And the focal length f is 20 cm, which is 0.2 meters. Oh wait, but sometimes in these formulas, focal length is in millimeters, so 20 cm would be 200 mm.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to recall the exact formula. Oh right, Abney's formula for the pinhole diameter is d = ( (2.44)^2 * λ * f )^(1/3 ), but that doesn't seem familiar. Alternatively, maybe it's d = (f * λ)^(1/2) multiplied by a constant.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d = ( (2.44 * λ * f ) )^(1/2 )? Hmm, but I'm not confident about that. Alternatively, I remember that the formula might be d = 0.57 * sqrt( f * λ ), where f is in millimeters and λ is in nanometers. Because 0.57 is a number I've heard in this context before.

Wait, let me try that approach. Let's plug in the numbers. The focal length f is 20 cm, which is 200 mm. The wavelength λ is 450 nm. So, d = 0.57 * sqrt(200 * 450).

Wait, let me compute that. 200 multiplied by 450 is 90,000. Then the square root of 90,000. Hmm, sqrt(90,000) is sqrt(9 * 10,000) which is 3 * 100 = 300. So, sqrt(90,000)=300.

Then, d = 0.57 * 300 = 171 mm. Wait, that can't be right. Because 171 mm is way too big for a pinhole. Pinholes are typically fractions of a millimeter in diameter. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait a second, maybe the formula uses the square root of (f * λ), but with f in the same units as λ. Oh wait, no, that wouldn't make sense because f is in mm and λ is in nanometers, so their product would have units of mm·nm, which is 1e-6 mm². Taking the square root would give mm·sqrt(nm), which is not correct units for diameter.

Hmm, perhaps I should convert the units so that f and λ are in the same unit. Let me try that.

Focal length f is 20 cm = 0.2 m = 200 mm.

Wavelength λ is 450 nm = 450e-9 m = 0.45 micrometers.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses f in meters and λ in meters. So f = 0.2 m, λ = 450 nm = 450e-9 m.

So, then, let's compute sqrt(f * λ). So f * λ = 0.2 * 450e-9 = 90e-9 m². Taking the square root gives sqrt(90e-9) m, which is sqrt(90)*1e-4.5 m. Wait, sqrt(90) is about 9.4868, and 1e-4.5 is approximately 3.16e-5. So 9.4868 * 3.16e-5 is approximately 3e-4 meters, which is 0.3 mm. But that's without any coefficient.

Wait, but if I use d = 0.57 * sqrt(f * λ), then 0.57 * 0.3 mm would be about 0.17 mm. But earlier that gave me a much larger number when I used mm for f. Hmm, I'm getting confused with the units here.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses f in millimeters and λ in micrometers. Because 450 nm is 0.45 micrometers. So f = 200 mm, λ=0.45 micrometer = 0.45e-3 mm, because 1 micrometer is 1e-3 mm.

So f * λ = 200 mm * 0.45e-3 mm = 200 * 0.00045 = 0.09 mm². Then sqrt(0.09) is 0.3 mm. So d = 0.57 * 0.3 mm = 0.171 mm. Hmm, but that's 0.171 mm, which is 0.17 mm, which isn't one of the options. Wait, the options are in 0.30 mm, 0.40 etc. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe the formula uses a different coefficient. Maybe it's d = (λ * f)^(1/2) without the 0.57 factor. Let me try that. So sqrt(200 mm * 450 nm). Wait, 450 nm is 0.45 micrometers, which is 0.00045 mm. So 200 * 0.00045 = 0.09 mm². Square root is 0.3 mm. So d would be 0.3 mm, which is option G. But wait, some sources say that Abney's formula uses a coefficient, so perhaps that's where I went wrong.

Wait, another approach: I think the formula might be d = (1.5 * λ * f )^(1/2), but with f in mm and λ in nm. So 1.5 * 450 nm * 200 mm. Wait, 450 nm is 0.45 micrometers, which is 0.00045 mm. Wait, no, that's not right. Because 1 nm is 1e-9 m, which is 1e-6 mm. So 450 nm is 450e-6 mm. So f is 200 mm, λ is 450e-6 mm.

So 1.5 * 450e-6 mm * 200 mm = 1.5 * 450e-6 * 200. Let's compute that.

450e-6 is 0.00045. 1.5 * 0.00045 = 0.000675. Multiply by 200: 0.000675 * 200 = 0.135. So the product is 0.135 mm². The square root of 0.135 is approximately 0.367 mm. So d would be about 0.367 mm. Looking at the options, the closest is option C: 0.57 mm? No, wait, option C is 0.57. Hmm, 0.367 is close to 0.36, but the options don't have that. Wait, perhaps the coefficient is different.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is d = ( (2.44)^2 * λ * f )^(1/3 ). Let's try that. 2.44 squared is about 5.95. So 5.95 * 450e-9 m * 0.2 m. Wait, units would be m^3 again. Taking the cube root would give meters. But that's getting complicated. I'm not sure if I'm on the right track.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = (f * λ)^(1/2) * a constant. Let me think, I've read that the optimal pinhole diameter is about 0.57 times the square root of (f times λ), but I'm not sure about the units.

Wait, perhaps f is in centimeters, and λ in nanometers. So f =20 cm, λ=450 nm. So f*λ=20*450=9000 cm·nm. Hmm, but to get mm, we need to convert units. Because 1 cm is 10 mm, 1 nm is 1e-6 mm. So 20 cm = 200 mm, 450 nm=0.00045 mm. So f * λ = 200 * 0.00045 = 0.09 mm². Square root is 0.3 mm, then multiplied by 0.57 gives 0.171 mm. But that's not matching any options except perhaps G is 0.30 mm.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses a different coefficient. Maybe the coefficient is 0.0366 instead of 0.57. Because I've read that the formula could be d = sqrt( (2.44 * λ * f) / 1000 ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = ( (2.44 * λ * f) )^(1/2 ) / 1000, but that would give d in meters. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = (f * λ)^(1/2) * 0.57, but I'm getting stuck on the units. Let me try to compute it correctly.

So f is in cm, so 20 cm. λ is in nm, 450 nm. To have consistent units, let's convert f to mm: 20 cm = 200 mm. λ in mm is 450e-9 m = 450e-6 mm = 0.00045 mm.

So f =200 mm, λ=0.00045 mm.

Then, d = 0.57 * sqrt(f * λ) = 0.57 * sqrt(200 * 0.00045 ).

Compute 200 * 0.00045 = 0.09 mm². sqrt(0.09) = 0.3 mm. So d=0.57 * 0.3 = 0.171 mm, which is approximately 0.17 mm. But looking at the options, the closest one is G: 0.30 mm, which is double that.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula doesn't include the 0.57 coefficient. So d = sqrt(f * λ) = 0.3 mm. Which is option G.

But wait, I thought Abney's formula includes the 0.57 factor. So perhaps I was supposed to use that. But without that factor, I get 0.3 mm, which is option G.

Wait, the options are:

A: 0.45 mm

B: 0.65 mm

C: 0.57 mm

D: 0.60 mm

E: 0.50 mm

F: 0.72 mm

G: 0.30 mm

Wait, so according to my calculation with the 0.57 factor, I get around 0.17 mm, which isn't an option. So perhaps I've made a mistake in including the 0.57 factor. Maybe the correct formula is d = sqrt( (2.44 * λ * f) ) / 1000.

Wait, let me try that. 2.44 * λ in nm * f in mm, then divided by 1000 to convert to mm.

So 2.44 * 450 nm * 200 mm.

Wait, 450 nm is 450e-9 m. But if I'm using f in mm, perhaps I should convert λ to mm as well. So 450 nm = 450e-9 m = 450e-6 mm = 0.00045 mm.

So 2.44 * 0.00045 mm * 200 mm = 2.44 * 0.00045 * 200 = let's compute that.

0.00045 * 200 = 0.09. Then 2.44 * 0.09 = 0.2196.

So sqrt(0.2196) = approx 0.4686 mm. Then, divide by 1000? Wait, no, that would make it 0.4686e-3 mm, which is 0.0004686 mm, which is way too small. That can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = sqrt( (2.44 * λ * f) ) / 1000, but without the division if units are correct. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of meters.

So f = 0.2 m, λ=450e-9 m.

So 2.44 * 450e-9 m * 0.2 m = 2.44 * 450e-9 * 0.2.

Calculating:

450e-9 = 4.5e-7.

2.44 * 4.5e-7 = approximately 1.098e-6.

Multiply by 0.2: 1.098e-6 * 0.2 = 2.196e-7.

Now, sqrt(2.196e-7) = approx 0.0004686 meters, which is 0.4686 mm. So d is about 0.47 mm. Looking at the options, the closest is option A: 0.45, or option I: 0.40, or option C:0.57.

Hmm, that's about 0.47, so perhaps 0.45 is the intended answer. But why?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the formula is d = sqrt( (1.5 * λ * f) ), but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula d = (f * λ)^(1/2) * 0.57, but that gave me 0.171 mm, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = 0.57 * sqrt( (f in mm) * (λ in micrometers) ). Because 450 nm is 0.45 micrometers. So f is 200 mm, λ is 0.45 micrometers.

Then, sqrt(200 * 0.45) = sqrt(90) ≈9.4868. Multiply by 0.57: 9.4868 * 0.57 ≈5.407 mm. That's way too big.

Wait, no, that can't be right. I think I messed up the units here. Because if λ is in micrometers, and f in mm, then their product would be mm·micrometers = 1e-3 mm², so sqrt would be 1e-1.5 mm, which is 0.0316 mm. Then 0.57 * 0.0316 ≈0.018 mm, which is 0.018 mm, which is even smaller than before.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach. I remember that the formula for the optimal pinhole diameter is approximately d = 0.57 * sqrt(f * λ), where f is in millimeters and λ is in nanometers. Wait, but would that make sense in terms of units?

Wait, let's see: f is in mm, λ in nm. So f in mm is 200, λ in nm is 450. So f * λ = 200 * 450 =90,000 mm·nm. But 1 mm is 1e6 nm, so 90,000 mm·nm =90,000 *1e6 nm² =9e11 nm². Wait, that doesn't help. Alternatively, perhaps converting to meters: 200 mm is 0.2 m, 450 nm is 450e-9 m. So f * λ = 0.2 *450e-9 =9e-8 m². The square root is 3e-4 m, which is 0.3 mm. Then multiply by 0.57 gives 0.171 mm. But that's not an option.

Wait, but perhaps the formula is d = sqrt( (f * λ) / 1000 ), where f is in mm and λ in nm. Let's try that.

f=200 mm, λ=450 nm. So f * λ= 200*450=90,000. Divide by 1000: 90. Square root is sqrt(90)=9.4868. So d≈9.4868 mm. That's way too big.

Hmm, I'm not getting anywhere. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the formula is d = ( (2.44 * λ * f ) )^(1/3 ), where f is in mm and λ in micrometers.

So 2.44 * 450 nm (which is 0.45 micrometers) * 200 mm.

Wait, units would be (micrometers * mm) which
