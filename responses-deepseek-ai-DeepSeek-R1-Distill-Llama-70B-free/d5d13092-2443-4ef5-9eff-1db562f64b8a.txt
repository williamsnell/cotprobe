Okay, so I have this question here about ecosystems changing from forests to grasslands when driving from east to west in the U.S. Hmm, I remember that in the U.S., the eastern part is more forested, and as you move west towards places like the Great Plains, it becomes more grassy. The question is asking why this shift happens. The options are various factors like wind speed, CO2, water, sunlight, etc.

So I think about what factors determine whether an area is a forest or grassland. Forests usually need more water, right? Trees have deeper roots but still require consistent moisture. Grasslands can survive with less water because their roots are different. So maybe the availability of water is the key here.

Wait, but why would it change from east to west? Oh, because as you go east to west in the U.S., you're moving away from the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. Those bodies of water bring a lot of moisture. So the east gets more rainfall, and the west is drier. That makes sense. So the amount of rainfall decreases as you go west, which would mean less available water for trees, leading to grasslands taking over.

Let me think if any other factors could be it. Temperature might play a role, but I think the main issue is water. Like, some deserts are hot, but grasslands aren't necessarily hot all the time. The length of the growing season might affect it too, but again, I think water is more critical because without enough water, trees can't grow as densely.

So the critical factor is the availability of water. Looking at the options, that's option C. So the answer should be C.

The shift from forest ecosystems to grasslands when driving east to west in the U.S. is primarily due to changes in the availability of water. Forests require consistent moisture, which is abundant in the eastern regions due to proximity to large bodies of water like the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. As one moves west, rainfall decreases, leading to drier conditions that favor grasslands over forests. Other factors like temperature or growing season length may play a role but are secondary to water availability.
