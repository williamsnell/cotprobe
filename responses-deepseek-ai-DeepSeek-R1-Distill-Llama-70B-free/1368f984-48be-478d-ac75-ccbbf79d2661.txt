Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says.

A 1-gram mass falls through a height H of 1 cm. All the energy from the fall is converted into yellow light with a wavelength of 6e-5 cm. The question is asking how many photons would be emitted. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, right. So I remember that when an object falls, it gains potential energy, which then converts into kinetic energy. But in this case, all the energy is converted into light. So I probably need to calculate the potential energy lost by the mass and then relate that to the energy of the photons.

Wait, potential energy is mgh. Oh, but wait, the formula is PE = m * g * h. But wait, mass is in grams here, I think I need to convert it to kilograms because the standard unit for mass in physics is kg. So 1 gram is 0.001 kg.

Gravity, g, is approximately 9.8 m/s². Oh wait, the height H is given in centimeters. I need to convert that to meters too. 1 cm is 0.01 meters.

So putting that together: PE = 0.001 kg * 9.8 m/s² * 0.01 m. Let me calculate that. 0.001 times 0.01 is 1e-5. Multiply by 9.8 gives 9.8e-5 Joules. So the potential energy is 9.8e-5 J.

But wait, the problem says all of this energy is converted into yellow light. So the total energy of the light is 9.8e-5 J. Now, I need to find out how many photons that corresponds to.

Each photon has an energy of E_photon = hc/λ. Where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

I remember h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. The speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s. The wavelength λ is given as 6e-5 cm, which is 6e-7 meters because 1 cm is 1e-2 m, so 6e-5 cm is 6e-7 m.

So calculating E_photon: (6.626e-34 J·s) * (3e8 m/s) / (6e-7 m). Let's compute that step by step.

Multiply numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25.

Denominator: 6e-7 m, so 1.9878e-25 / 6e-7 = (1.9878 / 6 )e(-25 +7) = approx 0.3313e-18 = 3.313e-19 J per photon.

So each photon has an energy of about 3.313e-19 J.

Now, the total energy is 9.8e-5 J. So the number of photons N is total energy divided by energy per photon.

N = 9.8e-5 J / 3.313e-19 J/photon.

Let me compute that: 9.8e-5 / 3.313e-19.

Let me write it as (9.8 / 3.313) * 1e( -5 +19 ) = (approx 2.958) * 1e14.

So approximately 2.958e14 photons. Looking at the options, let's see:

Looking back, the options are:

A: 1.5e14

B:4.5e14

C:18e14

D:12e14

E:24e14

F:15e14

G:6e14

H:3e14

I:7.5e14

J:9e14

Wait, my calculation gave about 2.96e14. None of the options match exactly. Hmm, did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait a minute, maybe I messed up unit conversions. Let me check each step again.

First, the potential energy.

Mass m = 1 gram = 0.001 kg. Correct.

Height H = 1 cm = 0.01 m. Correct.

g is 9.8 m/s². So PE = mgh = 0.001 *9.8 *0.01.

Calculating that:

0.001 kg * 9.8 m/s² = 0.0098 N. Multiply by 0.01 m: 0.0098 * 0.01 = 0.000098 J. Which is 9.8e-5 J. That seems right.

Photon energy: E = hc/λ.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

c=3e8 m/s.

λ = 6e-5 cm = 6e-7 m. Yes.

So E = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / (6e-7).

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = (6.626 *3 )e(-34+8) = 19.878e-26 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Wait, no, because 6.626e-34 *3e8 is 1.9878e-25 J·s * m/s * (1/s) ? Wait, no, J is kg·m²/s². Let me think: the units for E should be in J.

Wait, more accurately:

h has units J·s, c is m/s. So h*c has (J·s)(m/s) )= J·m.

Divide by λ (in meters) gives J. So the units are correct.

So back to calculation:

E = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / 6e-7

= (6.626 *3 /6 )e(-34 +8 - (-7)) ?

Wait, exponents: 1e-34 *1e8 = 1e-26. Then divide by 1e-7 (because 6e-7 is 6*1e-7), so 1e-26 /1e-7 = 1e-19.

Wait, perhaps a better way: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 6.626 *3 = ~19.878, and 1e-34 *1e8 =1e-26. So 19.878e-26 J·m.

Divide by 6e-7 m: (19.878e-26) / 6e-7 = (19.878/6) * (1e-26 / 1e-7) )= 3.313 *1e-19 J.

So E_photon is 3.313e-19 J. That part seems correct.

Now, N = 9.8e-5 J / 3.313e-19 J/photon.

9.8e-5 is 9.8 * 1e-5.

So 9.8 /3.313 is roughly 2.956.

So 2.956e( -5 +19 )= 2.956e14 photons.

Looking at the options, the closest is option H:3e14. But wait, let me check the options again.

Wait the options given are:

A:1.5e14

B:4.5e14

C:18e14

D:12e14

E:24e14

F:15e14

G:6e14

H:3e14

I:7.5e14

J:9e14.

Hmm, I got approximately 2.96e14. So the closest option is H:3e14, but let me double-check my calculations because the options don't have that exact number. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Let me recalculate 9.8e-5 divided by 3.313e-19.

Compute 9.8e-5 = 9.8 * 1e-5 = 0.000098.

3.313e-19 is 3.313 *1e-19.

So 0.000098 / (3.313e-19) = (9.8e-5) / (3.313e-19) = (9.8 /3.313) * 1e14.

Let me compute 9.8 /3.313.

3.313 times 2.95 is 3.313 * 2 =6.626, 3.313 *0.95= approx 3.146. So 6.626 +3.146=9.772. That's close to 9.8. So 2.95 gives 9.772, which is just a bit less than 9.8. The difference is about 0.028. So perhaps 2.96.

9.8/3.313 = approximately 2.957.

So 2.957e14, which is about 2.96e14 photons.

Looking at the options, the closest is H:3e14. But wait, let me check if any of the options is 2.9e14. No, the options go from 1.5e14 to 24e14 in steps that don't include 2.9e14. So perhaps I made a mistake. Did I miscalculate the potential energy?

Wait another thought—could the mass be 1 gram, which is 0.001 kg, correct. H is 1 cm, which is 0.01 m, correct. So mgh is 0.001 *9.8 *0.01.

0.001 *0.01 is 0.00001. 0.00001 *9.8 is 0.000098 J, which is 9.8e-5 J. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the photon energy.

Wait, let me recalculate E_photon.

E_photon = hc/λ.

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

c=3.0e8 m/s.

λ=6e-7 m.

So E = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / (6e-7).

Compute numerator:6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25.

Divide by 6e-7: 1.9878e-25 /6e-7 = (1.9878 /6 )e(-25 +7) = 0.3313e-18 = 3.313e-19 J. So that's correct.

So N = 9.8e-5 /3.313e-19 = approx 2.96e14.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I missed a factor somewhere. Let me think.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I used the wrong value for h or c. Let me confirm the constants.

h is Planck's constant, which is 6.62607015e-34 J·s. So correct.

c is speed of light, 2.99792e8 m/s, approximately 3e8. So correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise calculation. Let me compute N more accurately.

N = (m g h) / (hc/λ) ) = (m g h λ) / (h c).

Wait, the h in numerator and denominator cancels out. So N = (m g h λ) / (c λ) ? No, wait, no, perhaps a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should write it as N = (m g h) / (E_photon) = (m g h) * λ / (h c).

So N = (m g h * λ) / (h c) ) = (m g h λ) / (h c).

So the h's cancel: N = (m g h λ) / (h c) = (m g λ h ) / (h c) ) → the h cancels, leaving (m g λ) / c.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me re-arrange:

E_photon = h c / λ → so 1/E_photon = λ/(h c).

So N = (m g h) * (λ) / (h c) → N = m g λ h / (h c) → h cancels, N= m g λ/(c).

Wait, that can't be right because I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should write N = (m g h) / (hc/λ) ) = (m g h * λ ) / (h c) ) = (m g λ ) / c.

Wait, that would make N = (m g λ ) / c.

Wait, that seems different from what I did before. Let me try that.

m = 0.001 kg.

g=9.8 m/s².

λ=6e-7 m.

c=3e8 m/s.

So N = (0.001 *9.8 *6e-7) / 3e8.

Calculate numerator: 0.001 *9.8 =0.0098.

0.0098 *6e-7 = (0.0098 *6) e-7 = 0.0588e-7 =5.88e-9.

Divide by 3e8: 5.88e-9 /3e8 = (5.88/3) * 1e-17 = 1.96e-17.

Wait that can't be right, because 1.96e-17 photons would be way too small, and doesn't match any of the options. So I must have messed up this approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula when rearranging. Let me think again.

Wait, the correct way is:

N = (Potential Energy) / (Energy per photon) = (m g h) / (h c / λ) )

= (m g h * λ) / (h c )

h cancels: (m g h λ ) / (h c ) → m g λ / c.

Wait, but then why in my first approach I get 2.96e14 and in this approach I get 1.96e-17? That can't be. There must be a mistake in the algebra.

Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, let me compute N as (m g h * λ) / (h c).

Wait, I think I might have mixed up the exponents.

Wait, m=0.001 kg =1e-3 kg.

g=9.8 m/s².

h=0.01 m.

λ=6e-7 m.

c=3e8 m/s.

So N = (1e-3 kg *9.8 m/s² *0.01 m *6e-7 m ) / (6.626e-34 J·s *3e8 m/s).

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because h is Planck's constant, which is in the denominator. Wait, no, in the denominator, it's (h c / λ ), so when you invert it, it's λ/(h c).

Wait, perhaps it's better to go back to the initial approach.

Wait, when I computed E_photon correctly as 3.313e-19 J, and N=9.8e-5 /3.313e-19 = approx 2.96e14. So why am I getting a different result in the second approach?

Ah, I see. Because in the second approach, I used N = (m g h * λ) / (h c ), but that can't be right because the units don't match. Let me check the units.

Potential energy is in J.

Energy per photon is in J.

So N should be unitless (number of photons).

In the first approach, when I did N= (m g h) / (h c / λ ), that works because (m g h) is J, and (h c / λ ) is J, so J/J is unitless.

In the second approach, when I wrote N = (m g h * λ )/(h c ), let's check the units.

m g h → kg * m/s² * m → kg·m²/s² → J.

λ → meters.

h → J·s.

c → m/s.

So numerator: J * m.

Denominator: (J·s) * (m/s )= J·s * m/s = J·m.

So numerator is J·m.

Denominator is J·m.

So J·m / (J·m) )= unitless. So that's correct.

But why when I compute N that way I get a different number?

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error. Let me compute N this way:

N = (m g h * λ ) / (h c )

Plugging in the numbers:

m=0.001 kg.

g=9.8 m/s².

h=0.01 m.

λ=6e-7 m.

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

c=3e8 m/s.

So numerator: 0.001 *9.8 *0.01 *6e-7.

Let me compute that:

0.001 *9.8 = 0.0098.

0.0098 *0.01 =0.000098.

0.000098 *6e-7 = 5.88e-10.

Denominator:6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25.

So N = 5.88e-10 / 1.9878e-25 = (5.88 /1.9878) * 1e15.

5.88 /1.9878 is approximately 2.958.

So 2.958e15 *1e-15? Wait, no. Wait, the denominator is 1.9878e-25, so 5.88e-10 /1.9878e-25 = (5.88/1.9878) * 1e( -10 +25 )= 2.958 * 1e15 = 2.958e15 photons.

Wait, but that's way larger than the 2.96e14 I got earlier. That's confusing. So which one is correct?

Wait, I think I'm making a mistake in the approach. Let me clarify.

Wait, in the initial approach, I computed E_photon = h c / λ =3.313e-19 J.

Then N = 9.8e-5 J /3.313e
