Okay, so I have this statistics problem here about testing the correlation coefficient. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question says that X and Y follow a bivariate normal distribution with correlation coefficient rho. We're testing H0: rho = 0 against H1: rho ≠ 0. The sample correlation coefficient r is 0.68, and we need to find the smallest sample size n so that we reject H0 at a 0.05 significance level.

Wait, right, when testing whether a correlation coefficient is zero, we usually use a t-test. I remember the formula for the test statistic is t = r * sqrt((n-2)/(1 - r²)). And this t-statistic follows a t-distribution with n-2 degrees of freedom.

So the approach is to calculate this t-statistic and see if it's beyond the critical value for a two-tailed test at alpha 0.05. Alternatively, calculate the p-value and see if it's less than alpha. But since we're dealing with sample size, maybe we can set up the equation where the t-stat equals the critical value, then solve for n.

Wait, the critical value for a two-tailed test with alpha 0.05 is the t-value such that the probability in each tail is 0.025. So the critical t-value would be t_(alpha/2, df), where df is n-2.

But since n is what we're solving for, this seems a bit circular. Maybe I can approach it by setting t_calculated = t_critical, and solve for n.

So let me write the formula again:

t = r * sqrt( (n-2) / (1 - r²) )

We need this t to be greater than or equal to the critical t-value for a two-tailed test at 0.05 significance.

Wait, but the critical t-value depends on n, which is what we're trying to find. Hmm, so maybe I can approximate or find n iteratively.

Alternatively, I can use the fact that for large degrees of freedom, the t-distribution approaches the standard normal distribution. But for smaller n, that's not accurate. But maybe the problem expects us to use the standard normal approximation? Or perhaps use a certain formula.

Wait, another thought: The test can also be based on the F-distribution, but I think that's more when comparing two variances. No, wait, no, for testing rho=0, the t-test is correct.

Let me think of the steps I need to take:

1. Write down the formula for the t-statistic.
2. Find the critical t-value for a two-tailed test with alpha=0.05 and df = n-2.
3. Set the calculated t equal to the critical t and solve for n.

But since the critical t depends on n, I can't directly solve algebraically. Maybe I can use a trial and error approach with the given options.

The options given are A:9, B:7, C:10, D:11, E:13, F:20, G:5, H:8, I:12, J:15.

So perhaps compute for each n, compute the t-stat and see if it's >= the critical t for that n.

So let's make a plan:

For each n in the options, compute t = 0.68 * sqrt( (n-2)/(1 - 0.68^2) )

Then, find the critical t-value for two-tailed alpha=0.05 with df = n-2.

If the computed t >= critical t, then reject H0. We need the smallest n where this is true.

So let's compute this for each n.

First, let's compute 0.68^2. 0.68 * 0.68. Let's see, 0.6 *0.6=0.36, 0.08*0.6=0.048, 0.08*0.08=0.0064. Wait, no, 0.68^2 is 0.4624.

So 1 - 0.4624 = 0.5376.

So the formula inside the sqrt becomes (n-2)/0.5376.

So for each n:

t = 0.68 * sqrt( (n-2)/0.5376 )

Compute this t, then find the critical t for df = n-2.

Let me compute for each option.

Option B: n=7 → df=5.

t = 0.68 * sqrt(5/0.5376) → sqrt(5/0.5376)=sqrt(9.306)= approx 3.05. So t≈0.68 *3.05≈2.074.

The critical t for df=5, two-tailed 0.05 is about 2.571 (I remember t-table, for df=5, 2.571).

So 2.074 < 2.571 → don't reject. So n=7 is not enough.

Option H: n=8 → df=6.

t = 0.68 * sqrt(6/0.5376) → 6/0.5376≈11.16 → sqrt≈3.34 → t≈0.68*3.34≈2.27.

Critical t for df=6 is 2.447. So 2.27 < 2.447 → still don't reject.

Option A: n=9 → df=7.

t=0.68*sqrt(7/0.5376)=0.68*sqrt(13.03) → sqrt(13.03)=3.61 → t≈2.46.

Critical t for df=7 is 2.365. So 2.46 > 2.365 → this would reject H0. So n=9 is sufficient. But wait, let me check the next options to see if a smaller n also works.

Wait, what about n=8? Did I calculate that right? df=6, critical t=2.447. The computed t was 2.27, which is less than 2.447. So n=8 doesn't work. n=9 gives t=2.46 > 2.365, so reject.

Is there a smaller n than 9 that works? Let's check n=10 just in case, but let's go step by step.

n=10 → df=8 → t=0.68*sqrt(8/0.5376) → 8/0.5376≈14.88 → sqrt≈3.86 → t≈0.68*3.86≈2.628.

Critical t for df=8 is 2.306. So 2.628>2.306 → reject. So n=10 also works, but we're looking for the smallest n. Since n=9 works and n=8 doesn't, the answer would be n=9. But wait, let me check n=8 again.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake.

For n=8:

n-2=6. So (n-2)/0.5376 =6/0.5376 ≈11.1608.

sqrt(11.1608) ≈3.341.

t=0.68 *3.341 ≈2.27.

Critical t for df=6 is 2.447 (two-tailed, alpha 0.05). Since 2.27 <2.447, we fail to reject H0 at n=8.

n=9: n-2=7 → 7/0.5376≈13.03 → sqrt≈3.61 → t=0.68*3.61≈2.46.

Critical t for df=7 is 2.365. So 2.46>2.365 → reject. So n=9 is sufficient. So the minimal n is 9, which is option A.

Wait, but wait. Let me check higher n's just to be thorough.

n=10: t≈2.628, critical 2.306 → reject.

n=11: t=0.68*sqrt(9/0.5376)=0.68*sqrt(16.73)=0.68*4.088≈2.78. Critical t for df=9 is 2.262 → reject.

So indeed, n=9 is the smallest option where the test statistic exceeds the critical value.

Wait, but let me check n=8 again. Maybe I miscalculated something. So n=8, df=6.

t=0.68*sqrt(6/0.5376)= 0.68 * sqrt(11.1608)= 0.68 *3.341≈2.27.

Yes, and the critical t for df=6 is 2.447. So 2.27 is less than that. So correct, n=8 isn't enough.

Therefore, the smallest n is 9. So the correct answer is option A:9.

To test \( H_0: \rho = 0 \) against \( H_1: \rho \neq 0 \), we use the t-test for the correlation coefficient. The test statistic is given by:

\[
t = r \cdot \sqrt{\frac{n-2}{1 - r^2}}
\]

where \( r = 0.68 \), \( \alpha = 0.05 \), and the degrees of freedom are \( \text{df} = n-2 \). The critical value for a two-tailed test at \( \alpha = 0.05 \) is \( t_{\alpha/2, \text{df}} \), which depends on \( n \). The goal is to find the smallest \( n \) such that the calculated \( t \)-statistic exceeds the critical \( t \)-value.

### Calculations for Each Option:
1. **Option B: \( n = 7 \)**
   - \( \text{df} = 5 \), \( t_{\alpha/2, 5} = 2.571 \)
   - \( t = 0.68 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{5}{1 - 0.68^2}} = 0.68 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{5}{0.5376}} \approx 2.074 \)
   - Since \( 2.074 < 2.571 \), \( H_0 \) is not rejected.

2. **Option H: \( n = 8 \)**
   - \( \text{df} = 6 \), \( t_{\alpha/2, 6} = 2.447 \)
   - \( t = 0.68 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{6}{1 - 0.68^2}} = 0.68 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{6}{0.5376}} \approx 2.27 \)
   - Since \( 2.27 < 2.447 \), \( H_0 \) is not rejected.

3. **Option A: \( n = 9 \)**
   - \( \text{df} = 7 \), \( t_{\alpha/2, 7} = 2.365 \)
   - \( t = 0.68 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{7}{1 - 0.68^2}} = 0.68 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{7}{0.5376}} \approx 2.46 \)
   - Since \( 2.46 > 2.365 \), \( H_0 \) is rejected.

4. **Option C: \( n = 10 \)**
   - \( \text{df} = 8 \), \( t_{\alpha/2, 8} = 2.306 \)
   - \( t = 0.68 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{8}{1 - 0.68^2}} = 0.68 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{8}{0.5376}} \approx 2.628 \)
   - Since \( 2.628 > 2.306 \), \( H_0 \) is rejected.

5. **Option D: \( n = 11 \)**
   - \( \text{df} = 9 \), \( t_{\alpha/2, 9} = 2.262 \)
   - \( t = 0.68 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{9}{1 - 0.68^2}} = 0.68 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{9}{0.5376}} \approx 2.78 \)
   - Since \( 2.78 > 2.262 \), \( H_0 \) is rejected.

### Conclusion:
The smallest \( n \) for which \( H_0 \) is rejected is \( n = 9 \).
