Question:

A landowner was the record owner of a 30-acre orchard outside the city. The landowner lived in a farmhouse on the orchard and used the property to raise produce. Adjoining the orchard directly to the west was a 10-acre vineyard that was owned in fee simple by a farmer. A four-lane highway adjoined the orchard directly to the east. The farmer discovered that the southern portion of the orchard was rarely used by the landowner for any of the landowner's farming activities and found a convenient gravel road leading from the vineyard across the orchard all the way to the four- lane highway. The farmer used this road adversely and openly for the entire 20-year prescriptive period, and in doing so, the farmer has acquired a prescriptive easement over the roadway across the orchard. Thereafter, the farmer conveys the vineyard to a buyer in fee simple. The deed recited that "the grantor hereby conveys the vineyard, together with an easement for the right of way across the orcharX, to the grantee. "After the buyer took possession of the vineyard, the landowner brought an appropriate action to prevent him from using the roadway across the orchard. The issue that will determine the outcome of this suit is whether

Options:

A: the easement was appurtenant.
B: the roadway was necessary for the farmer's use of the vineyard.
C: easements can be reserved to third parties.
D: the buyer had knowledge of the easement prior to purchasing the vineyard.
E: the description in the farmer's deed to the buyer was adequate to identify the portion of the orchard that the farmer used as a roadway.
F: the farmer had the right to transfer the easement to the buyer.
G: the landowner had given express permission for the roadway to be used.
H: the buyer will make excessive use of the roadway.
I: the farmer used the roadway continuously for the required prescriptive period.
J: the deed mentioned the easement specifically.

Okay, I'm trying to work through this legal problem. Let's see what it's about. So, there's a landowner who owns a 30-acre orchard and lives there, using it to raise produce. To the west of the orchard is a 10-acre vineyard owned by a farmer. East of the orchard is a four-lane highway. 

The farmer found that the southern part of the orchard wasn't used much by the landowner and there's a gravel road from the vineyard through the orchard to the highway. The farmer used this road openly and adversely for the full 20-year prescriptive period, so he got a prescriptive easement over that road.

Then, the farmer sells the vineyard to a buyer, and the deed mentions conveying the vineyard along with an easement for the right of way across the orchard. Now, the landowner is trying to stop the buyer from using the road. The issue is determining what will decide the outcome of this suit.

The question is about the key issue in this case. The options are A through J, each pointing to a different legal principle.

I remember that prescriptive easements require that the use be open, adverse, continuous, and for the statutory period. Since the farmer used it for 20 years (the prescriptive period), he acquired the easement. Now, when he sells the vineyard, the easement should pass to the buyer if it's appurtenant.

An easement is appurtenant when it benefits the dominant estate (here, the vineyard) and burdens the servient estate (the orchard). So, the easement here is appurtenant because it's for access from the vineyard to the highway.

The issue is whether the easement can be transferred. Since the farmer validly acquired the easement, he should be able to transfer it to the buyer. So the key issue is whether the easement was appurtenant, meaning it's attached to the land and can be passed on.

Looking at the options, option A is whether the easement was appurtenant. That makes sense because if it's appurtenant, it goes with the land when sold. If it's not, maybe it's a personal easement and can't be transferred.

Other options: Option F says whether the farmer had the right to transfer the easement. But I think the ability to transfer depends on whether it's appurtenant. So the underlying issue is appurtenancy, making A the key.

Other options like B (necessity) relate to easements by necessity, which isn't the case here because the easement was acquired through prescription, not necessity. Easements by necessity don't apply here. So B isn't the issue.

Option E is about describing the easement in the deed. The deed does mention the easement, so maybe that's not the issue. The description might be adequate, but the main point is whether the easement was appurtenant so it could be transferred.

So I think the answer is A.

The issue determining the outcome of this case revolves around whether the prescriptive easement acquired by the farmer is appurtenant. An easement is appurtenant when it benefits the dominant estate (the vineyard) and burdens the servient estate (the orchard). Since the easement provides access from the vineyard to the highway, it meets the criteria of an appurtenant easement. This is crucial because appurtenant easements can be transferred with the land when the dominant estate is sold. The key issue is not whether the farmer had the right to transfer the easement (which depends on it being appurtenant) or other factors like necessity or description, but rather whether the easement was appurtenant, allowing it to pass to the buyer. 

Answer: A
