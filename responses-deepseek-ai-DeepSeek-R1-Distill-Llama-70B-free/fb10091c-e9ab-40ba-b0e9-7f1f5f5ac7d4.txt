Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Richardson-Self's arguments on sexist speech. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking what Richardson-Self argues regarding whether sexist speech is hate speech. The options are from A to J. I remember that Richardson-Self is a philosopher who has written about the distinction between hate speech and what she calls "derogatory speech." 

Wait, right, she argues that not all sexist speech is automatically hate speech. Instead, she makes a distinction based on whether the speech incites violence or discrimination. So, sexist speech is only considered hate speech if it goes beyond mere offense and actually promotes discrimination or violence against a group.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it can never be considered hate speech regardless of context. That doesn't sound right because context matters, and some sexist speech might incite violence.

Option B claims it's never hate speech because it's free expression. But free speech laws do have exceptions, like incitement to violence, so this might not be correct.

Option C states it's always hate speech because it doesn't involve violence. No, that's the opposite. Richardson-Self would say it's not always hate speech unless it involves violence or discrimination.

Option D says it's not always hate speech because it doesn't involve violence. Wait, that's not exactly right. She argues that it's hate speech when it does involve violence or discrimination, so the absence of violence doesn't automatically make it not hate speech. Hmm, maybe not.

Option E claims it's always hate speech because it involves violence. No, because if it doesn't involve violence, she wouldn't classify it as hate speech.

Option F says it's not hate speech because of freedom of speech. But freedom of speech doesn't protect all speech, especially if it incites violence.

Option G says it's always hate speech because it promotes gender inequality. But Richardson-Self's point is more about the effect (like discrimination or violence), not just promoting inequality.

Option H states it's only hate speech when it directly incites violence. That's close, but I think her view is broader, including promotion of discrimination as well, not just inciting violence.

Option I says it can be considered hate speech when it promotes discrimination. That sounds right because she argues that when speech promotes discrimination, it should be categorized as hate speech.

Option J claims it's not always hate speech because it always involves violence. That doesn't make sense because not all sexist speech involves violence, and her argument is about when it does involve violence or discrimination.

So putting it together, Richardson-Self believes that sexist speech isn't automatically hate speech. It's only hate speech when it promotes discrimination or incites violence. So the correct answer should be the option that reflects that it can be hate speech when it promotes discrimination.

Looking back, Option I says: "Can be considered hate speech when it promotes discrimination." That fits her argument.

The correct answer is based on Richardson-Self's argument that sexist speech is only considered hate speech when it promotes discrimination or incites violence, not inherently. 

Answer: I
