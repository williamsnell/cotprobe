Question:

A developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural part of the county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. The franchise right created for public utilitycompanies would most likely be an example of a(an)

Options:

A: restrictive covenant.
B: license.
C: real covenant.
D: equitable servitude.
E: covenant running with the land.
F: profit à prendre.
G: easement in gross.
H: allodial title.
I: easement appurtenant.

Okay, so I have this question about real property law, specifically dealing with different types of interests in land. Let me try to work through this step by step.

The question describes a developer who owns several hundred acres and has a general development plan recorded. This plan includes various restrictions on the land, which is to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions apply to all future owners, heirs, assigns, and lessees, and they are charged with notice because the plan is recorded.

The specific restrictions mentioned are number 22 and 23. Restriction 22 creates a franchise right in a 10-foot strip along the rear of each lot for public utility companies, allowing them ingress and egress. Restriction 23 says no houses or structures can be built on that strip. The question is asking what this franchise right is an example of, with the options being various property law terms.

So, I need to figure out what kind of interest this franchise right represents. Let's go through the options one by one.

Option A: Restrictive covenant. Restrictive covenants are agreements that restrict the use of land. They are usually found in deeds and bind future owners. They are a type of covenant that "runs with the land," either at law or in equity. But the question is about the franchise right, which gives a right to use the land, not just restrict its use. So maybe not this, but I'm not sure yet.

Option B: License. A license is a personal right to use someone else's land, but it's revocable and doesn't create an interest in the land. Since this franchise right is part of a recorded plan and applies to all future owners, it's more than just a personal license. So probably not B.

Option C: Real covenant. A real covenant is similar to a restrictive covenant and runs with the land. Again, this is more about imposing a restriction rather than granting a right to use. So maybe not the best fit.

Option D: Equitable servitude. Equitable servitudes are another type of restrictive covenant enforced in equity. They are created through a written instrument, like a deed, and bind all subsequent owners. But again, this seems more about restricting use rather than granting a right. Wait, but sometimes servitudes can also create affirmative rights, like the right to use a road. Hmm, maybe. But I'm not certain yet.

Option E: Covenant running with the land. This is a broader term that includes both real covenants and equitable servitudes. But again, it's about the covenant itself, not the specific right granted. The franchise right might be part of a covenant, but the question is about the nature of that right.

Option F: Profit à prendre. This is a right to take something from the land, like minerals, timber, or fish. It doesn't seem to fit here because the franchise right is about using the land for utilities, not taking resources. So probably not F.

Option G: Easement in gross. An easement in gross benefits a person or company rather than a particular piece of land. Public utility companies often have easements in gross because they serve the public and their right isn't tied to ownership of adjacent land. This seems to fit because the franchise is for utility companies to use the strip, regardless of who owns nearby properties. Also, the easement is for ingress and egress, which is a typical easement right.

Option H: Allodial title. This refers to complete ownership of land without any obligations to a superior. It doesn't relate to the franchise right at all. So not H.

Option I: Easement appurtenant. An easement appurtenant benefits a particular piece of land (the dominant estate) and is attached to it, with the burden on the servient estate. But in this case, the utility companies are the ones benefiting, and it's not tied to a specific parcel of land they own. So it's more likely an easement in gross.

So putting it all together, the franchise right is an easement. Since it's for a utility company and not tied to a specific parcel, it's an easement in gross, which is option G.
</think>

The franchise right described in the question is an interest in land that grants public utility companies the right to use a 10-foot strip for ingress and egress. This type of right is not a restrictive covenant, license, or profit à prendre, as it involves a specific, affirmative right to use the land. It is also not an allodial title or an easement appurtenant, as it is not tied to a dominant estate. Instead, it fits the definition of an easement in gross, which benefits a person or entity (in this case, the public utility companies) rather than a specific piece of land. 

Easements in gross are often used by utility companies to serve the public interest, and the fact that this right is created for public utility companies and is not dependent on ownership of adjacent land confirms that it is an easement in gross.
