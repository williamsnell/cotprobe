Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about magnetic flux through a coil. Hmm, I remember that magnetic flux is a measure of how much magnetic field is passing through a certain area. The formula for flux is Φ = B * A * cosθ, where B is the magnetic flux density, A is the area, and θ is the angle between the magnetic field and the normal to the surface.

Wait, the problem says the coil is mounted with its plane perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic flux. Oh right, so when the plane is perpendicular, the magnetic field is passing through the area at an angle of 0 degrees because it's parallel to the plane. Wait, wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If the plane is perpendicular to the field direction, then the field is passing through the coil perpendicular to its plane, so the angle θ is 0 degrees. Because when the field is perpendicular to the plane, it's going straight through, so the cosine of 0 is 1. So the flux should just be B multiplied by the area.

The coil is circular, so the area is πr². The diameter is given as 20 mm. Oh, right, so radius is half of that, which is 10 mm. But wait, I need to convert that into meters because the flux density is given in Tesla, and SI units are in meters. So 10 mm is 0.01 meters.

Calculating the area: π*(0.01 m)^2. Let me compute that. 0.01 squared is 0.0001 m². Multiply by π, so the area is approximately 0.000314 m².

The magnetic flux density B is given as 100 mT. Oh wait, milliTesla is 1e-3 T. So 100 mT is 0.1 T.

Now, putting it all into the formula: Φ = B * A = 0.1 T * 0.000314 m².

Let me do the multiplication step by step. 0.1 * 0.000314 = 0.0000314 Weber (since 1 T*m² is 1 Weber).

But wait, the options are in microWebers. Oh right, because 1 micro is 1e-6. So 0.0000314 Wb is 31.4 microWebers.

Looking at the options, option E is 31.4 μWb. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I mix up the angle? If the plane is perpendicular to the field direction, then the field is parallel to the plane. Oh wait, no, no. Let me clarify: the plane of the coil is perpendicular to the magnetic field. So the magnetic field lines are going through the coil perpendicularly, which means the angle between B and the normal to the plane is 0 degrees. So cos(0) is 1, so that's correct.

Yes, so the calculation is correct. So the flux is 31.4 microWebers, which is option E.

To determine the total magnetic flux threading the circular coil, we use the formula for magnetic flux:

\[
\Phi = B \cdot A \cdot \cos\theta
\]

Here:
- \( B = 100 \, \text{mT} = 0.1 \, \text{T} \) (magnetic flux density),
- \( A = \pi r^2 \) (area of the circular coil),
- \( \theta = 0^\circ \) (since the plane of the coil is perpendicular to the magnetic field, the angle between the field and the normal to the plane is \( 0^\circ \), so \( \cos(0^\circ) = 1 \)).

The diameter of the coil is \( 20 \, \text{mm} = 0.02 \, \text{m} \), so the radius is:

\[
r = \frac{\text{diameter}}{2} = \frac{0.02}{2} = 0.01 \, \text{m}.
\]

The area of the coil is:

\[
A = \pi r^2 = \pi (0.01)^2 = \pi (0.0001) \approx 0.000314 \, \text{m}^2.
\]

Substituting into the flux formula:

\[
\Phi = B \cdot A = 0.1 \cdot 0.000314 = 0.0000314 \, \text{Wb}.
\]

Since \( 1 \, \mu\text{Wb} = 10^{-6} \, \text{Wb} \), we convert:

\[
\Phi = 0.0000314 \, \text{Wb} = 31.4 \, \mu\text{Wb}.
\]

Thus, the total flux threading the coil is \( 31.4 \, \mu\text{Wb} \), which corresponds to option **E**.
