Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Fabry-Perot etalon problem. Hmm, let's see what I remember about this. Fabry-Perot etalons are those optical instruments that use interference between multiple reflected beams to create interference fringes. They're often used in spectroscopy for high resolution.

The question says that the etalon is adjusted so that for a wavelength of 5461 Angstroms, interference fringes are observed. The thickness of the etalon is 1.01 cm. Then, when the pressure inside the box is changed by 6.46 cm Hg, there's a shift of one fringe. The original pressure was 77 cm Hg, and I need to find the index of refraction of the air at room temperature and that original pressure.

Wait, right. The basic idea with Fabry-Perot interferometers is the condition for constructive interference. The formula is usually 2nt cos(theta) = (m + 1/2) lambda, where n is the refractive index, t is the thickness, m is the order of interference, and theta is the angle of incidence. But since the telescope is focused for infinity, I think theta is zero (normal incidence), so cos(theta) is 1. So the equation simplifies to 2nt = (m + 1/2)lambda.

But wait, in this case, the medium inside the etalon is air, right? So n would be the refractive index of air. But air's refractive index is just a bit more than 1. At standard conditions, I think it's around 1.00027 or something. But here, the pressure is 77 cm Hg, which is a bit less than atmospheric pressure (which is about 76 cm Hg at sea level). Wait, 77 is actually a bit higher. Hmm, maybe that's a typo, but I'll go with the given values.

So the setup is that when the pressure changes, the refractive index of the air inside the etalon changes, which changes the optical path length. Since the etalon is in a box with transparent windows, changing the pressure inside affects the air's properties.

The problem states that when the pressure changes by 6.46 cm Hg, the fringe shifts by one. So a change in pressure causes a change in n, which changes the optical path, leading to a shift in the interference pattern.

I remember that for a Fabry-Perot etalon, a change in the optical path length by lambda/2 causes a shift of one fringe. Because the condition for constructive interference is every lambda/2 change would move to the next maximum or minimum.

Wait, let me think again. The phase change for a shift from one maximum to the next is 2pi, right? So the change in the path difference would be lambda/2 for a phase change of 2pi. Because each lambda corresponds to 2pi phase shift, so lambda/2 would correspond to pi, but wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things.

Alternatively, the number of fringes shifted is given by delta N = (change in path difference) / (lambda / 2). So for one fringe shift, delta N = 1, so the change in path difference is lambda/2.

So the change in path length delta_L is lambda / 2.

The path length L is 2nt, because the light goes through the etalon twice (once each way for each reflection). So L = 2nt. So a small change in L would be delta_L = 2 (n delta t + t delta n). But wait, in this case, the thickness t isn't changing because the etalon's physical thickness is fixed. So delta_L is due to change in n. So delta_L = 2 t delta_n.

Wait, but wait, actually, in the problem, the pressure is changing, so the air's refractive index changes. The thickness of the etalon is fixed, so t is constant. So delta_L = 2 t (n2 - n1) = 2 t delta_n.

And according to the fringe shift condition, delta_L = lambda / 2.

So setting these equal: 2 t delta_n = lambda / 2.

So delta_n = lambda / (4 t).

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. The phase shift is 2 pi delta_L / lambda. So for a phase shift of 2 pi (which would be one fringe shift), delta_L = lambda. But wait, no: each fringe corresponds to a phase shift of 2 pi, and the path difference for that is lambda. Because when the path difference increases by lambda, you go through one more cycle. So delta_L = lambda would cause N fringes to shift by one.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

In a Michelson interferometer, a path difference change of lambda/2 causes a shift of one fringe. Because the condition for bright to dark is lambda/2. So for a Fizeau or similar, moving one surface by lambda/2 would cause the fringes to shift by one.

But for a Fabry-Perot, the path difference is 2t (since it's a round trip). So any change in 2t would cause a phase shift. So if 2t changes by lambda, that would cause a phase shift of 2pi, hence one fringe shift.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula for fringe shift in a Fabry-Perot. But since I can't look it up, I'll proceed with the reasoning.

The condition for constructive interference is 2nt = m lambda, where m is an integer (assuming it's at the peak and considering no phase change upon reflection, but the exact condition might vary based on reflections).

When the pressure changes, n changes by delta_n, causing a change in the path length. So the new thickness in terms of optical path is 2 (n + delta_n) t.

The change in optical path is 2 t delta_n. For this to cause a shift of one fringe, the change in path should correspond to a change in m by 1. So delta_m = 1.

So, the original condition is 2 n t = m lambda.

After change, 2 (n + delta_n) t = (m + delta_m) lambda.

Subtracting: 2 t delta_n = delta_m lambda.

Given delta_m is 1 (shift of one fringe), 2 t delta_n = lambda.

Wait, wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So according to this, delta_L = 2 t delta_n = lambda.

So delta_n = lambda / (2 t).

Wait, but earlier I thought that a phase shift of 2 pi (one fringe) would require delta_L = lambda. So this aligns with that reasoning.

But the problem states that the pressure change causes a shift of one fringe. So the change in n would be delta_n = lambda/(2 t).

But wait, the pressure is changing, so how does that affect n? Because n for air depends on pressure. I remember that n of air is given by n = 1 + delta, where delta is proportional to pressure. At standard pressure, delta is about 0.00027.

The formula I think is n = 1 + (P / P0) * (n0 - 1), where P0 is reference pressure and n0 is the refractive index at that pressure. Or perhaps it's n = 1 + k * P, where k is some constant.

Alternatively, I know that for air at low pressure, the refractive index can be approximated by n ≈ 1 + (P / P_standard) * (n_standard - 1), assuming temperature is constant. Or maybe using the ideal gas law, since pressure and density are related.

Wait, the refractive index of gases is often proportional to their density. Because n-1 is proportional to the density. So if pressure changes and temperature is constant, then density is proportional to pressure. So n - 1 is proportional to P.

So, if at pressure P1, n1 = 1 + a P1, and at P2, n2 =1 + a P2. Then delta_n = n2 - n1 = a (P2 - P1). But wait, in this case, when the pressure decreases, n decreases as well.

Wait, but in our case, the pressure is changing from P_initial to P_initial - delta_P. So delta_P is 6.46 cm Hg. Wait, the problem says when the pressure is changed by 6.46 cm Hg, the shift is one fringe. So delta_P is 6.46 cm Hg.

Wait, the original pressure is 77 cm Hg, and the change is 6.46 cm Hg. So the new pressure is 77 ±6.46 cm Hg. But the direction (increase or decrease) probably doesn't matter for the calculation, because we're taking the absolute value of delta_n.

So, using n = 1 + k P, where P is in some units, but then the change delta_n would be k delta_P.

But I need to find k. Alternatively, I can relate the change in n to the change in pressure.

So let's go back. We have delta_n = lambda/(2 t).

But delta_n is also equal to (n_initial - n_final) or vice versa. Wait, if pressure decreases, n decreases, so if delta_P is a decrease of 6.46 cm Hg, then delta_n is negative.

But since we're looking for the original n, which is at 77 cm Hg, perhaps the delta_n is positive when the pressure increases.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the change in n is proportional to the change in pressure.

Wait, the formula I remember for the refractive index of air is given by (n - 1) = (P / P0) * (n0 - 1), where P0 is standard atmospheric pressure, and n0 is the refractive index at that pressure.

Wait, but standard pressure is about 76 cm Hg, but in this problem, the original pressure is 77 cm Hg. So perhaps P0 is 77 cm Hg for this problem.

Wait, but I think the general relation is n = 1 + (P / P_ref) * (n_ref - 1), where P_ref is some reference pressure where n_ref is known.

Wait, but maybe a better approach is to use the ideal gas law. Since n is proportional to the density, and density is proportional to pressure (at constant temperature), so (n -1) is proportional to pressure.

So, (n -1) = k P, where k is a constant.

But I think the exact expression is (n-1) = (P / P0) * (n0 - 1), where P0 is a reference pressure (like 1 atmosphere), and n0 is the refractive index at that pressure.

Wait, another approach: the refractive index of air at 0 degrees Celsius and 1 atm (which is about 76 cm Hg) is approximately 1.000292. But in this case, the pressure is 77 cm Hg, which is slightly higher than standard, so n would be a bit higher than that.

But perhaps I can find k using this. Let me think. At standard pressure P0 = 76 cm Hg, n0 = 1.000292.

So, (n0 -1) = k P0 => k = (n0 -1)/P0 = (0.000292) / 76 cm Hg.

But wait, units? Pressure in cm Hg, so P is in cm Hg.

Wait, but in the problem, the pressure change is 6.46 cm Hg, so delta_P is 6.46 cm Hg.

So, when the pressure changes by delta_P, the change in n is delta_n = k delta_P.

But wait, from the earlier equation, delta_n = lambda/(2 t).

So, let's write:

delta_n = (n0 -1) * (delta_P / P0 )

Wait, no, because (n -1) is proportional to P, so delta_n = (n0 -1) * (delta_P / P0 )

Wait, let's check. At P = P0, n = n0, so n0 -1 = k P0.

If P changes by delta_P, then n changes by delta_n = k delta_P.

But since k = (n0 -1)/P0, then delta_n = (n0 -1) * (delta_P / P0 ).

Hmm, but that seems a bit circular. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to model delta_n as proportional to delta_P, with the proportionality constant being (n_initial -1)/P_initial.

Wait, but let me proceed step by step.

We have:

1. The change in pressure is delta_P = 6.46 cm Hg.

2. The corresponding change in n is delta_n = (n_initial -1) * (delta_P / P_initial )

Because (n_initial -1) is proportional to P_initial, as per (n-1)=kP.

So, delta_n = (n_initial -1) * (delta_P / P_initial )

Because (n -1) is proportional to P, so the fractional change is (delta_P / P_initial).

But wait, it's a linear relation, so the change in (n-1) is (n_initial -1) * (delta_P / P_initial )

So, delta_n = (n_initial -1) * (delta_P / P_initial )

But from the Fabry-Perot condition, delta_n = lambda/(2 t)

So, setting them equal:

(n_initial -1) * (delta_P / P_initial ) = lambda/(2 t )

We can solve for (n_initial -1):

n_initial -1 = [ lambda/(2 t) ] * [ P_initial / delta_P ]

Once we compute that, then n_initial is 1 plus that value.

Now, let's plug in the numbers.

lambda is given as 5461 Angstroms. Let's convert that to cm because t is in cm.

1 Angstrom = 1e-8 cm. So lambda = 5461e-8 cm.

t = 1.01 cm.

delta_P is 6.46 cm Hg.

P_initial is 77 cm Hg.

So,

n_initial -1 = [ (5461e-8 cm) / (2 * 1.01 cm) ) ] * (77 cm Hg / 6.46 cm Hg )

Let me compute the first part: 5461e-8 / (2 * 1.01 )

Numerator: 5461e-8 cm = 5.461e-5 cm.

Denominator: 2*1.01=2.02.

So 5.461e-5 / 2.02 = approx 2.706e-5.

Then multiply by (77 / 6.46 ) = approx 11.92.

So, 2.706e-5 * 11.92 ≈ 3.223e-4.

So, n_initial -1 ≈ 3.223e-4.

So n_initial ≈ 1 + 0.0003223 = 1.0003223.

Looking at the options, option H is 1.000323, which is very close.

So the correct answer would be H.

To solve the problem, we analyze the Fabry-Perot etalon setup. The etalon has a thickness \( t = 1.01 \, \text{cm} \), and interference fringes are observed for a wavelength \( \lambda = 5461 \, \text{Å} = 5461 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{cm} \). When the pressure changes by \( \Delta P = 6.46 \, \text{cm Hg} \), there is a shift of one fringe. The original pressure is \( P_{\text{initial}} = 77 \, \text{cm Hg} \). The goal is to find the refractive index of air at room temperature and the original pressure.

### Key Equations and Analysis:
1. **Fringe Shift Condition**: A shift of one fringe corresponds to a change in the optical path length \( \Delta L = \lambda \). For a Fabry-Perot etalon, the optical path length is \( L = 2nt \), where \( n \) is the refractive index of air. Since the thickness \( t \) is constant, the change in \( L \) is due to the change in \( n \):
   \[
   \Delta L = 2t \Delta n = \lambda
   \]
   Solving for \( \Delta n \):
   \[
   \Delta n = \frac{\lambda}{2t}
   \]

2. **Refractive Index and Pressure Relation**: The refractive index of air \( n \) is related to pressure \( P \) by the proportionality \( n - 1 \propto P \). At constant temperature, the change in \( n \) is proportional to the change in pressure:
   \[
   \Delta n = (n_{\text{initial}} - 1) \cdot \frac{\Delta P}{P_{\text{initial}}}
   \]

3. **Combining Equations**: Equating the two expressions for \( \Delta n \):
   \[
   (n_{\text{initial}} - 1) \cdot \frac{\Delta P}{P_{\text{initial}}} = \frac{\lambda}{2t}
   \]
   Solving for \( n_{\text{initial}} - 1 \):
   \[
   n_{\text{initial}} - 1 = \frac{\lambda}{2t} \cdot \frac{P_{\text{initial}}}{\Delta P}
   \]

4. **Substitute Values**:
   - \( \lambda = 5461 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{cm} = 5.461 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{cm} \)
   - \( t = 1.01 \, \text{cm} \)
   - \( \Delta P = 6.46 \, \text{cm Hg} \)
   - \( P_{\text{initial}} = 77 \, \text{cm Hg} \)

   Compute:
   \[
   n_{\text{initial}} - 1 = \frac{5.461 \times 10^{-5}}{2 \cdot 1.01} \cdot \frac{77}{6.46}
   \]

   - First term: \( \frac{5.461 \times 10^{-5}}{2 \cdot 1.01} = 2.706 \times 10^{-5} \)
   - Second term: \( \frac{77}{6.46} \approx 11.92 \)
   - Multiply: \( 2.706 \times 10^{-5} \cdot 11.92 \approx 3.223
