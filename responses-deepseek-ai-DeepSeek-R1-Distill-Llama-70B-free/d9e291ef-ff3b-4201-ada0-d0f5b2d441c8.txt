Okay, so I've got this question about the WISC test and the percentage of the population that scores between 70 and 130. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct answer from the options given. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the WISC is a type of IQ test used for children. It stands for Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. IQ tests are standardized, so they have a mean and a standard deviation. I think the mean is 100 and the standard deviation is 15. Yeah, that sounds right because for adults, the WAIS uses the same scale.

So, if the average is 100 and each standard deviation is 15 points, then the range of 70 to 130 would cover how many standard deviations from the mean? Let's see, 70 is 30 points below 100, which is two standard deviations because 15 x 2 is 30. Similarly, 130 is 30 points above, which is also two standard deviations above. So the range is from -2 SD to +2 SD.

Now, in a normal distribution, about 68% of the population falls within one standard deviation of the mean (between 85 and 115, since 100 Â±15). But wait, that's for one SD. What about two standard deviations? I think the 95-68-99.7 rule applies here. Oh right, the empirical rule says that 95% of data falls within two SDs. So two SDs would cover about 95% of the population.

Wait, but the options don't have 95% as the answer. Let me check the options again. Oh, option E is 95, which would fit. But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The question is about scoring between 70 and 130, which is exactly two SDs each side.

Wait, no, wait a second. The normal distribution says that 68% is within one SD, 95% within two SDs, and 99.7% within three. So from -2 SD to +2 SD is 95% of the population. So the answer should be approximately 95%, which is option E.

But wait, another thought: sometimes in such tests, the percentages can be a bit off because the actual distribution might not perfectly match the theoretical curve, but for standardized tests like the WISC, they're designed to fit the normal distribution closely. So I think the 95% figure holds.

Looking back at the options, option E is 95, so that's the correct choice.

The WISC (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children) is a standardized IQ test with a mean score of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. The question asks for the percentage of the population that scores between 70 and 130, which corresponds to a range of -2 standard deviations to +2 standard deviations from the mean. 

In a normal distribution, approximately 95% of the population falls within two standard deviations of the mean. This aligns with the empirical rule, which states that 95% of data lies within this range. Since the WISC is designed to closely approximate a normal distribution, the percentage of the population scoring between 70 and 130 is approximately 95%.

From the given options, the correct answer is:

E: 95

Answer: E
