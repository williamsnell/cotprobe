Okay, so I've got this question about economics and education. Let me try to break it down. The question says that education makes Chris a better worker, voter, parent, and citizen. Then it asks, because the benefits of education go beyond what Chris himself enjoys, what does that mean for externalities and whether education should be subsidized or taxed.

Hmm, I remember that externalities are when the actions of a person or firm affect others without compensation. So if Chris getting an education benefits not just him but others too, like society as a whole, that's a positive externality. Because when he's a better worker, maybe he's more productive, which can help the economy. Being a better voter means he makes more informed decisions, which is good for democracy. Being a better parent might mean his kids are better educated too, which benefits society in the long run.

So positive externalities occur when the benefits of an activity spill over to others. Now, the question is about whether this leads to the market underproducing or overproducing the good. I think with positive externalities, the market will underproduce because the person (Chris) doesn't capture all the benefits. So society values education more than just what Chris values it at.

In such cases, the government often steps in to correct this market failure. One way is through subsidies. Subsidizing means the government pays part of the cost so that more people can afford education, increasing the quantity produced. This way, the positive externalities can be realized more broadly.

Looking at the options, I need to pick the one that mentions externalities and should be subsidized. Let me look at the options again.

Option G says "externalities and should be subsidized." That sounds right. Other options: Option A says no externalities, which is wrong because we've established there are benefits beyond Chris. Option E says externalities and should be taxed, which doesn't make sense because we want to encourage positive externalities, not tax them. Taxing would be for negative externalities, like pollution.

Wait, so the correct answer should be G. Let me double-check. Positive externalities lead to underproduction, so government subsidies are the solution. Yes, that makes sense.

The question examines the concept of externalities in the context of education. Education provides benefits beyond the individual, such as making Chris a better worker, voter, parent, and citizen. These spillover benefits to society constitute positive externalities. In the presence of positive externalities, the market tends to underproduce the good or service because the individual does not capture all the benefits. To correct this market failure, governments often subsidize education to increase its production and ensure that the broader societal benefits are realized.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option G** correctly identifies that education generates externalities and should be subsidized to address the underproduction caused by positive externalities.
- Other options are incorrect because they either deny the presence of externalities (e.g., A, I), suggest taxation (e.g., E, H), or misalign the policy response with the type of externality (e.g., B, D, F, J).

Thus, the correct answer is:

G: externalities and should be subsidized.

Answer: G
