Okay, so I've got this question about banking and money supply, and I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The bank has $250,000 in deposit liabilities. Hmm, deposit liabilities are basically the deposits that customers have made, right? So that's like the money people have in their checking and savings accounts. Then, the bank has $175,000 in loans. Loans are the money the bank has lent out to people. And they have $75,000 in reserves. Reserves are the funds that the bank keeps on hand, not lent out, which they're required to keep as a reserve against deposits.

The first part of the question asks what happens to the money supply when the bank lends an additional $25,000. Then, the second part is about when the loan is repaid, ignoring interest.

First, I need to understand how bank lending affects the money supply. From what I remember, when a bank makes a loan, it's creating money. Because when the bank lends money, it credits the borrower's account, increasing their deposits. So that increases the money supply. But wait, how does that exactly work?

Let me think about it. Suppose someone goes to the bank and takes out a $25,000 loan. The bank doesn't just hand them cash from their vault; instead, they create a new deposit in the borrower's account. So the borrower's deposit increases by $25k. This means the money supply in the economy increases by that amount because more money is circulating. But wait, the bank's reserves might change as a result.

Wait, the bank's reserves were $75k. After making the new loan, the bank's loans increase by $25k, so loans go from $175k to $200k. But where did that $25k come from? The bank had reserves of $75k, so they must have used some of their excess reserves to make the loan. But if they use reserves to make the loan, does that affect the money supply?

Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up concepts. Let me think again. The initial deposits are $250k. The bank has made $175k in loans, so the reserves are $75k. When the bank makes a new $25k loan, the borrower's deposit account increases by $25k. So the total deposits in the bank go up by $25k, from $250k to $275k. Because the bank is just creating that deposit; it's not taking cash from reserves but rather expanding its balance sheet.

Wait, but how does that work exactly? So the money supply is essentially the total amount of deposits that people have. So when the bank makes a new loan, which increases deposits, that should increase the money supply. But wait, doesn't the bank need to have sufficient reserves? Oh, right, but in this case, the bank has $75k in reserves. So when they make a $25k loan, they're using part of their reserves. But wait, making a loan doesn't necessarily reduce reserves immediatelyâ€”it's about how the money is used.

Wait, perhaps a better way to approach this is to model the bank's balance sheet before and after the loan. Let me try that.

Before the loan:

Assets:
- Loans: $175,000
- Reserves: $75,000
Total assets: $250,000

Liabilities:
- Deposits: $250,000

When the bank makes a $25,000 loan, the borrower's account is credited $25k, so deposits increase by $25k. So now deposits are $275k. But the loan is an asset for the bank, so their Loans asset increases by $25k to $200k.

So the new balance sheet would be:

Assets:
- Loans: $200,000
- Reserves: $75,000 (Wait, or does reserves decrease? Because the bank is using its reserves to make the loan.)

Ah, maybe that's where I'm getting confused. Because when the bank makes a loan, does it use reserves or create new money? So in reality, when a bank makes a loan, it doesn't typically use its reserves. Instead, it creates a new deposit, which increases the money supply. The reserve requirement comes into play when the bank needs to maintain a certain percentage of reserves against deposits. But in the short term, making a loan just increases both assets (loans) and liabilities (deposits). So the reserves might not change immediately.

Wait, but in the initial situation, the bank has $75k in reserves. When they make a $25k loan, they credit the borrower's account, increasing deposits to $275k. The bank's assets are now loans $200k and reserves $75k, totaling $275k. So their reserves didn't decrease. So the bank's reserves remain the same, but the deposits have increased. Thus, the money supply (deposits) increases by $25k. So the direct effect is an increase in the money supply by $25,000.

But wait, another perspective: the money supply is also affected by how much of that loan is spent. When the borrower spends the $25k, the money goes into circulation, increasing the money supply. But in this case, as soon as the loan is made, the deposit increases, so maybe the money supply directly increases by $25k upon the loan being made.

Now, the second part: when the loan is repaid. So the borrower pays back $25k. How does that affect the money supply?

When the loan is repaid, the borrower's deposit decreases by $25k. So the deposits go back down to $250k. The bank's loans decrease by $25k, back to $175k, and the bank's reserves would increase by $25k because they receive the repayment. So the money supply, which is the total deposits, decreases by $25k as the deposits are reduced.

But wait, the question asks about the direct effect. So when the bank lends, the money supply increases by $25k. When the loan is repaid, the money supply decreases by $25k.

Looking at the options, let's see. The first part's effect is an increase of $25k. So the options with that are B and perhaps others.

Wait, the question asks for the direct effect on the money supply in each scenario. So the first part is when the bank lends the additional $25k, which increases the money supply by $25k. The second part is when the loan is repaid, which decreases the money supply by $25k.

But looking at the options, let's check:

A: Money supply increases by $50k. That would be if both actions somehow increased, but that's not the case.

B: Money supply increases by $25k. That's the first part.

C: Money supply decreases by $25k. That's the second part.

D: No change. That would be if both actions offset each other.

Wait, but the question has two parts. But the options are each a single answer. Wait, wait, looking again, the question says: "What is the direct effect on the money supply if the bank lends an additional $25,000? What is the direct effect on the money supply when the loan is repaid (ignoring interest)?" So each part is a separate question, but the options here are presented as single answers. Oh wait, no, the options are for the entire question, which includes both parts. Wait, no, the options are each a possible answer to the entire question, which consists of two parts. So each option would describe the effects of both actions.

Wait, no, looking at the options, each is a single statement. So perhaps the question is a two-part question, but the options are each possible single answers. Wait, no, perhaps I'm misreading. Let me check the question again.

Wait, the question asks: What is the direct effect on the money supply if the bank lends an additional $25,000? What is the direct effect when the loan is repaid?

So two separate questions. But the options are labeled A to J, each being a single option. So perhaps each option is the answer to both parts. Hmm, maybe I need to re-examine the structure.

Wait, the user wrote the options as A through J, but in the provided part, the options are from A to D. Let me check again.

The user wrote: "Options: A: ... B: ... C: ... D: ...".

So each option is a statement about the effect of both actions. Wait, let me read the options again.

Option A: Money supply increased by $50k. That would suggest that both the loan and repayment somehow increased the money supply, which doesn't make sense.

Option B: Increased by $25k. That would be the case if only the initial loan increased the money supply.

Option C: Decreased by $25k. That would be the case if the loan repayment caused a decrease.

Option D: No change. So if the two actions offset each other.

Wait, but in the scenario, the first action (lending) increases money supply by $25k, and the second action (repayment) decreases it by $25k. So the net effect is zero. But the question is about the direct effect of each action separately.

Wait, no, the first part is the effect of the initial loan, and the second part is the effect when the loan is repaid.

So if the question is asking for the effect of each, then the answer would be that the first part increases by $25k, and the second part decreases by $25k. But since the options are presented as single answers, perhaps the correct answer is B for the first part and C for the second. But the options are presented as possible answers for the entire question, which might involve both.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the combined effect of both actions, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Let me read the question again.

The question says: What is the direct effect on the money supply if the bank lends an additional $25,000? What is the direct effect when the loan is repaid (ignoring interest)? So each part is a separate question, but the options are single statements.

Wait, but perhaps the initial question is just about the first part, and the second part is another question, but the options are presented as each being an answer to the first part. No, the way it's written, it's a single question with two parts. So each option must cover both parts. Hmm, but the options don't seem to cover both.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

When the bank makes a loan, it increases the money supply because deposits increase. So the first part's effect is a $25k increase. When the loan is repaid, the deposits decrease by $25k, so the money supply decreases by $25k.

So the two direct effects are: first, an increase of $25k; second, a decrease of $25k.

Looking at the options, the first effect is described in option B (increase by $25k), and the second effect in option C (decrease by $25k). But since the options are presented as single answers, perhaps the question is only asking about one of them, but the way it's written, it's two separate questions. Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is phrased as a single question about both actions. Let me read the question again.

"Suppose a bank has $250,000 in deposit liabilities, $175,000 in loans and $75,000 in reserves. What is the direct effect on the money supply if the bank lends an additional $25,000? What is the direct effect on the money supply when the loan is repaid (ignoring interest)?"

So the first part is about the lending, the second about repayment. So the correct answers for each would be: first part, B (increase by $25k); second part, C (decrease by $25k). But the options are presented as possible answers for each part. So perhaps the question is structured such that each part is a separate question, but in the given context, the user is to select one option that applies to both.

Wait, perhaps the initial question is only about the first part, and the second part is an additional question. But in the setup, it's presented as a single question. Alternatively, perhaps the first part's answer is B, and the second part's answer is C, but the options are only providing four choices, so the correct answer for each part is B and C respectively.

But the way the options are presented in this question, perhaps the correct answer is B for the first part and C for the second. But the options are A to D, so perhaps the question is only about the first part, and the second is a separate question. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the net effect of the two actions.

Wait, but in the initial scenario, the bank lends $25k, which increases the money supply by $25k. Then later, when the loan is repaid, the money supply decreases by $25k. So the net effect is zero. But the question is about the direct effect when each action happens, not the net effect.

So if the question is about the first part, the answer is B. If it's about the second part, the answer is C. But the way the question is phrased, it's two separate questions. However, the options are presented as single statements, so perhaps each option is about both.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

When the bank makes a new loan, it creates new money by increasing deposits. So the money supply increases by $25k. When the loan is repaid, the deposits decrease, so the money supply decreases by $25k.

Thus, the first part's effect is an increase of $25k (option B), and the second part's effect is a decrease of $25k (option C).

But the options are presented as possible answers for the entire question. So each option is a possible answer about both parts. But the way the question is phrased, it's asking for both effects. So perhaps the correct answer is that when the bank lends, money supply increases by $25k (B), and when repaid, it decreases by $25k (C). But since the options don't combine both, perhaps the question is only about the first part.

Wait, perhaps the initial question is only about the first part, and the second part is a separate question. But the way the user presented it, the question includes both parts but the options are per each scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the combined effect, but that's not the case. The question clearly asks for the direct effect in each scenario separately.

Wait, maybe the question is only about the first part, and the second part is just additional information. But that's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the overall effect, but that's not what it's asking.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for the correct answer based on standard economic principles. When a bank makes a loan, the money supply increases by the amount of the loan. When the loan is repaid, the money supply decreases by the same amount. So the first effect is +$25k, the second is -$25k.

Looking at the options, the first effect would correspond to option B, and the second to option C. But since the options are presented as separate answers, I think the question is asking for each part, but the way the options are given, each is a possible answer. So perhaps the answer is B for the first part and C for the second. But the options are presented as A to D, each being a possible answer to each part.

Wait, but the user's question includes both parts, and the options are four possible answers. So perhaps the correct answer is B and C, but that's not possible as each option is a single choice. So perhaps the intended answer is B for the first part and C for the second, but the options are structured such that each option is for a single part. But in this case, the user is to choose the correct option for each scenario, but the way the options are presented, each is a possible answer for the entire question. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the question is only about the first part. Looking back, the question is phrased as two separate questions: the effect of lending, and the effect of repayment. So each would have its own answer. But in the options given, each is a single statement, so perhaps the intended answer for the first part is B, and for the second part, C.

But the way the question is presented here, it's one question with two parts, but the options are four possible answers. So perhaps the first part's answer is B, and the second part's answer is C, but the question is asking for both, so the correct answer would be that the money supply first increases by $25k, then decreases by $25k, making the options B and C respectively.

But the options are given as A to D, each a single answer. So perhaps the correct answer is B for the first part and C for the second. But the user's options don't allow for multiple selections, so perhaps the question is only about the first part.

Wait, perhaps the question is only asking about the first part, the effect of the bank lending an additional $25,000. Then the answer would be B. Alternatively, if the question is about the repayment, the answer would be C.

But the question as given includes both parts, so perhaps the correct answer is that the first action increases the money supply by $25k, and the second decreases it by $25k. But the options don't cover both, so perhaps the intended answer is B for the first part.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the first part.

In any case, based on standard banking principles, when a bank makes a loan, it increases the money supply by the amount of the loan. So the correct answer to the first part is B: the money supply has increased by $25,000.

The second part, when the loan is repaid, the money supply decreases by $25,000, which would correspond to option C.

But since the question includes both parts and the options are presented as single answers, perhaps each part is treated separately. So the correct answer for the first part is B, and for the second part, C.

However, in the options provided, each is a single answer, so perhaps the question is only about the first part, making the correct answer B.
</think>

When a bank makes a loan, it increases the money supply by the amount of the loan because it credits the borrower's account, thereby increasing deposits. In this case, lending an additional $25,000 increases the money supply by $25,000. Conversely, when the loan is repaid, the borrower's deposits decrease by $25,000, reducing the money supply by the same amount.

For the first part of the question, the direct effect of the bank lending an additional $25,000 is an increase in the money supply by $25,000. For the second part, the direct effect of the loan being repaid is a decrease in the money supply by $25,000.

Given the options provided,
