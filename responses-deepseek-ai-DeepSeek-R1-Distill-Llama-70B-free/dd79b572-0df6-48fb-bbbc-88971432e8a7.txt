Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which factor contributed significantly to the revival of natural law in the 20th century. Hmm, natural law... I remember that it's a philosophy that suggests there's a moral law inherent in nature, and it's universal. Historically, it's been tied to ideas about human rights and justice.

The question gives me options from A to H. Let me think about each one. 

Option A: The end of the Cold War. That was in the late 80s/early 90s. I'm not sure how that ties directly to natural law. The Cold War was more about political ideologies like capitalism vs. communism, but maybe the end of it influenced some movements, but I'm not certain if it's the main factor here.

Option B: The Bolshevik Revolution. That happened in 1917, so early 20th century. The Bolsheviks were communists, and I think they were more about class struggle and Marxist theory, which might actually oppose natural law since Marxists often have different views on rights and law based on economic structures. Not sure, but maybe not the main contributor.

Option C: International recognition of human rights after WWII. Oh, right, after the atrocities of World War II, there was a big push for human rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 comes to mind. Natural law is connected to human rights because it's about universal moral principles that apply to everyone. So this seems like a strong candidate because people were looking for a moral framework to prevent such horrors again, and natural law fit into that.

Option D: The invention of the Internet. That's more recent, like late 20th century. The internet affects communication and information, but I'm not sure how it directly ties to the revival of natural law. Maybe it's not the main factor here.

Option E: The rise of Fascism. That's in the mid-20th century, like with Hitler and Mussolini. Fascism is more about authoritarianism and nationalism. Natural law is about inherent rights, which might conflict with fascist ideologies that prioritize the state over individuals. So maybe the rise of fascism would be against natural law, but I'm not sure if it caused a revival. Possibly the opposite.

Option F: The rise of Communism in China. That's more about Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, which again is tied to Marxist ideologies. Similar to the Bolsheviks, I don't think this would support natural law. Communist regimes often have their own legal frameworks that might not align with natural law principles.

Option G: Depression of the 1930s. The Great Depression was an economic crisis. I'm not sure how that ties to natural law. Economic hardships might influence social policies, but I don't see a direct link to the revival of natural law ideas.

Option H: The advent of the Industrial Revolution. Wait, the Industrial Revolution was in the 18th and 19th centuries, so that's before the 20th century. The question is about the 20th century revival, so this might not be relevant. Unless there's a continued effect, but I think the main impact was earlier.

Putting it all together, I think the key event was the aftermath of WWII. The horrors of the war led to a renewed focus on human rights, which aligns with natural law. So option C seems correct.

The revival of natural law in the 20th century was significantly influenced by the international recognition of human rights after World War II. The atrocities of the war led to a global effort to establish universal moral principles, culminating in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. This aligns with natural law's emphasis on inherent and universal rights, making it the key factor in its revival.

Answer: C
