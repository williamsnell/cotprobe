Okay, so I've got this biology question about lizards and their coloration. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my animal defenses, but let me think through this.

The question says: A lizard that lacks a chemical defense mechanism is colored the same as one that does have the defense. What's this called?

Wait, from what I remember, there are different types of mimicry and coloration strategies in animals. Let me try to recall.

So, there's something called aposematic coloration, which is when an animal has bright colors to warn predators that it's distasteful or dangerous. That's like the skunk's smell or a poison dart frog's bright colors. But that's when the animal actually has the defense.

Then there's mimicry. I think there are two main types: Batesian and Müllerian. Batesian mimicry is when a harmless animal mimics a harmful one. So the mimic doesn't have the defense but looks like the one that does. Müllerian is when both animals are harmful and they both benefit by advertising their toxicity together.

So in this question, the lizard without the defense is colored like the one that does. That sounds like Batesian mimicry. Because the non-defensive lizard is mimicking the appearance of the one that's defended. The idea is that predators will avoid both because they think they're the same.

Wait, but what's the exact term? The question uses the term 'displaying', so it's about the mechanism. So the first lizard (no defense) mimics the second (with defense). So that's Batesian. Because the first is getting protection by looking like the second, which is actually protected.

Wait, wait. Another thought: Could it be Müllerian? No, because in Müllerian, both have defenses. So that's not the case here.

Another option is aposematic coloration, but that's when the animal does have the defense. So the first lizard doesn't have it, so it's not aposematic. Instead, it's mimicking the aposematic coloration.

So the correct term should be Batesian mimicry. Let me check the options. Option J is Batesian mimicry. So the answer would be J.

Wait, but looking back, I think I might have mixed up the terms. Let me make sure. Another possibility is that if the lizard is harmless and looks like a harmful one, that's Batesian. Yes, that's right.

So in the question, the lizard without defense is mimicking the one with defense. So it's Batesian mimicry, which is option J.

The question involves a lizard without a chemical defense mechanism that is colored the same as a lizard with such a defense. This scenario describes a situation where the non-defensive lizard mimics the appearance of the defensive one to deter predators. This is an example of Batesian mimicry, where a harmless species mimics a harmful or defended species to gain protection. 

In contrast, Müllerian mimicry involves two harmful species mutually benefiting from sharing similar warning coloration, which is not applicable here since only one species is defended. Aposematic coloration refers to the warning signals of the defended species itself, not the mimic. Therefore, the correct answer is Batesian mimicry.

Answer: J
