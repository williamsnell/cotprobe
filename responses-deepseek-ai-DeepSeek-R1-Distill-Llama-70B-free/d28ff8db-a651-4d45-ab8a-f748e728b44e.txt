Alright, so I've got this question about why international stabilization schemes haven't been super successful in keeping the prices of products like wheat, rice, sugar, and coffee steady. Hmm, okay, I remember that these schemes are usually agreements between countries to manage supply and stabilize prices. But why only moderately successful?

The options are A through D. Let me think about each one.

Option A says lack of adequate funding. I guess if a scheme doesn't have enough money, it might struggle. But wait, I think some of these schemes do get decent funding, especially if major countries are involved. Maybe funding isn't the main issue.

Option B is lack of participation from major countries. That makes sense because if big players don't join, the scheme can't really control the market. For example, if a major coffee exporter doesn't participate, the agreement can't effectively influence prices. But I'm not sure if that's the main reason for moderate success.

Option C suggests inefficiency in management. Poor management can definitely cause problems, but I feel like the main issues might be more about the economic factors rather than just how it's managed. Although, maybe inefficient management contributes to the problem.

Option D talks about failures due to inappropriate price settings and countries withdrawing when the market is favorable. Oh, right, setting the right price is tricky. If the agreed price is too high, it might encourage overproduction, leading to surpluses and then prices drop. Or if it's too low, producers might not comply. Also, when the free market price goes up, countries might leave the agreement because they can get better prices elsewhere. That sounds like a big issue because it undermines the whole scheme.

So, putting it together, Option D seems to cover two main points: wrong price settings leading to supply issues and countries pulling out when the market is better. That dual problem would definitely make the schemes only moderately successful.

I think the answer is D.

The correct answer is D because international stabilization schemes often fail due to inappropriate price settings, which can lead to overproduction or non-compliance, and countries may withdraw when free market prices become more favorable, undermining the scheme's effectiveness.

Answer: D
