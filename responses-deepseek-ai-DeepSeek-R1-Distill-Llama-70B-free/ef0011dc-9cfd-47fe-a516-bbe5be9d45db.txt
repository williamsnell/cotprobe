Okay, so I have this problem here with three equations involving a, b, c, and the cosines of angles alpha, beta, gamma. The question is asking for the value of cos²(alpha) + cos²(beta) + cos²(gamma) + 2*cos(alpha)*cos(beta)*cos(gamma). Hmm, that expression looks familiar, like maybe some trigonometric identity, but I'm not sure yet.

Let me write down what I know. The given equations are:

a = b cos(gamma) + c cos(beta)  
b = c cos(alpha) + a cos(gamma)  
c = a cos(beta) + b cos(alpha)

And we have a² + b² + c² > 0, which probably means that not all of a, b, c are zero. So they are real numbers, and at least one is non-zero.

I think I should try to find a relationship between the cosines. Maybe I can manipulate the equations to find something about alpha, beta, gamma.

Wait, these equations look symmetric. Maybe I can treat them as a system of linear equations. If I arrange them, perhaps I can write them in matrix form. Let me try that.

So, let's rearrange each equation:

1. a - b cos(gamma) - c cos(beta) = 0  
2. -a cos(gamma) + b - c cos(alpha) = 0  
3. -a cos(beta) - b cos(alpha) + c = 0  

So in matrix form, it would be:

[ 1       -cos(gamma)     -cos(beta) ] [a]   [0]  
[ -cos(gamma)  1          -cos(alpha) ] [b] = [0]  
[ -cos(beta)  -cos(alpha)   1        ] [c]   [0]

Hmm, this is a homogeneous system. For a non-trivial solution (since a² + b² + c² >0), the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero. So the determinant of this 3x3 matrix should be zero.

Calculating the determinant might be a way to find an equation involving the cosines. Let's compute the determinant.

The matrix is:

| 1        -Cγ      -Cβ |  
| -Cγ      1        -Cα |  
| -Cβ      -Cα       1  |

Where Cα = cos(alpha), etc., to make it shorter.

The determinant D is:

1*(1*1 - (-Cα)*(-Cα)) )  
- (-Cγ)*( -Cγ*1 - (-Cα)*(-Cβ) )  
+ (-Cβ)*( (-Cγ)*(-Cα) - 1*(-Cβ) )

Wait, maybe it's easier to write it out step by step. The determinant for a 3x3 matrix:

D = A11*(A22*A33 - A23*A32) - A12*(A21*A33 - A23*A31) + A13*(A21*A32 - A22*A31)

So plugging in the values:

A11 = 1, A12 = -Cγ, A13 = -Cβ  
A21 = -Cγ, A22 =1, A23 = -Cα  
A31 = -Cβ, A32 = -Cα, A33=1  

So D = 1*(1*1 - (-Cα)*(-Cα)) )  
       - (-Cγ)*( (-Cγ)*1 - (-Cα)*(-Cβ) )  
       + (-Cβ)*( (-Cγ)*(-Cα) - 1*(-Cβ) )

Wait, let's compute each part:

First term: 1 * (1*1 - (Cα)^2) = 1*(1 - Cα²) = 1 - Cα²

Second term: - (-Cγ) * [ (-Cγ)*1 - (Cα*Cβ) ) ]  
Which is: Cγ * [ -Cγ - Cα Cβ ]  
Wait, no. Let me compute the term inside the bracket:

A21*A33 - A23*A31 = (-Cγ)(1) - (-Cα)(-Cβ)  
= -Cγ - (Cα Cβ)  
So the second term becomes: - (A12) * (that)  
A12 is -Cγ, so it's - (-Cγ) * (-Cγ - Cα Cβ)  
Which is Cγ * (-Cγ - Cα Cβ)  
= - Cγ² - Cγ Cα Cβ

Third term: + A13 * (A21*A32 - A22*A31)  
A13 is -Cβ  
A21*A32 = (-Cγ)(-Cα) = Cγ Cα  
A22*A31 = (1)(-Cβ) = -Cβ  
So the term is [Cγ Cα - (-Cβ)] = Cγ Cα + Cβ  
So the third term is (-Cβ) * (Cγ Cα + Cβ)  
= -Cβ (Cγ Cα + Cβ)  
= - Cβ Cγ Cα - Cβ²  

Putting all together:

D = (1 - Cα²) + (- Cγ² - Cγ Cα Cβ ) + (- Cβ Cγ Cα - Cβ² )

Simplify:

D = 1 - Cα² - Cγ² - Cβ² - 2 Cα Cβ Cγ

So the determinant D equals 1 - (Cα² + Cβ² + Cγ²) - 2 Cα Cβ Cγ 

But since the system has non-trivial solutions, D must be zero:

1 - (Cα² + Cβ² + Cγ²) - 2 Cα Cβ Cγ = 0  
=> Cα² + Cβ² + Cγ² + 2 Cα Cβ Cγ = 1

Wait, but the question is asking for Cα² + Cβ² + Cγ² + 2 Cα Cβ Cγ. So according to this equation, that sum equals 1.

So the value is 1. Looking back at the options, option D is 1.0.

The problem involves six real numbers \(a, b, c, \alpha, \beta, \gamma\) with the condition \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 > 0\). The equations given are:

\[
a = b \cos(\gamma) + c \cos(\beta), \quad b = c \cos(\alpha) + a \cos(\gamma), \quad c = a \cos(\beta) + b \cos(\alpha).
\]

The goal is to find the value of \(\cos^2(\alpha) + \cos^2(\beta) + \cos^2(\gamma) + 2 \cos(\alpha) \cos(\beta) \cos(\gamma)\).

### Key Steps:
1. **Matrix Representation**: The equations can be rewritten in matrix form as a homogeneous system:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix}
   1 & -\cos(\gamma) & -\cos(\beta) \\
   -\cos(\gamma) & 1 & -\cos(\alpha) \\
   -\cos(\beta) & -\cos(\alpha) & 1
   \end{bmatrix}
   \begin{bmatrix}
   a \\ b \\ c
   \end{bmatrix}
   =
   \begin{bmatrix}
   0 \\ 0 \\ 0
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Non-Trivial Solutions**: Since \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 > 0\), the system has non-trivial solutions. For this to occur, the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero:
   \[
   \det\begin{bmatrix}
   1 & -\cos(\gamma) & -\cos(\beta) \\
   -\cos(\gamma) & 1 & -\cos(\alpha) \\
   -\cos(\beta) & -\cos(\alpha) & 1
   \end{bmatrix} = 0.
   \]

3. **Determinant Calculation**: Expanding the determinant gives:
   \[
   1 - \cos^2(\alpha) - \cos^2(\beta) - \cos^2(\gamma) - 2 \cos(\alpha) \cos(\beta) \cos(\gamma) = 0.
   \]

4. **Rearranging**: Rearranging the terms yields:
   \[
   \cos^2(\alpha) + \cos^2(\beta) + \cos^2(\gamma) + 2 \cos(\alpha) \cos(\beta) \cos(\gamma) = 1.
   \]

Thus, the value of \(\cos^2(\alpha) + \cos^2(\beta) + \cos^2(\gamma) + 2 \cos(\alpha) \cos(\beta) \cos(\gamma)\) is **1.0**.
