Question:

In 1996, a developer purchased a 100-acre tract located in a northern county in a state. Shortly thereafter, the developer prepared a subdivision plan that created 100 one-acre residential building lots on this tract. In 1997, the subdivision plan was recorded with the county recorder's office. During the next few years, the developer sold 60 residential lots to individual purchasers. Each deed specified that every lot designated on the subdivision plan was to be recorded in the county recorder's office. Each deed also provided the following:"No house trailer or mobile home shall be built or maintained on any lot within the subdivision. "In 2003, the developer conveyed the remaining 40 lots to a builder by deed that included language identical to that contained in the first 60 deeds. This deed from the developer to the builder was recorded. By 2008, the builder had sold all of the 40 lots. Each of these deeds identified each lot as being a part of the subdivision, but did not include the clause relating to mobile homes. On January 30, 2009, a buyer, who had purchased one of the residential lots from the builder, placed a mobile home on his property. Which of the following statements is LEAST accurate with respect to the buyer's deed?

Options:

A: The covenant prohibiting mobile homes ran with the land as far as the builder, but not as far as the buyer.
B: The covenant prohibiting mobile homes could be enforced by any subdivision lot owner.
C: The buyer should have had constructive notice of the restriction against mobile homes.
D: All subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of estate.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this real estate law question. Let me start by reading through the problem carefully.

In 1996, a developer bought 100 acres and made a subdivision plan with 100 one-acre lots. He recorded the plan in 1997. Then, over the next few years, he sold 60 lots to individuals. Each deed had a clause saying no mobile homes or house trailers allowed. Also, each deed specified that every lot was part of the recorded subdivision plan.

In 2003, the developer sold the remaining 40 lots to a builder. The deed to the builder included the same no-mobile-home clause and was recorded. By 2008, the builder sold all 40 lots. But the deeds to those buyers didn't include the mobile home clause, though they did mention being part of the subdivision.

Now, in 2009, a buyer who bought from the builder put a mobile home on his lot. The question is about the buyer's deed and which statement is least accurate.

The options are A to D. I need to figure out which one is incorrect.

First, I remember that covenants can run with the land if certain conditions are met. For a covenant to run with the land, it needs to be in the deed, "touch and concern" the land, and there needs to be horizontal privity (original parties) and vertical privity (subsequent owners) or, in some cases, notice.

The developer's original 60 deeds had the covenant. The 40 lots sold to the builder in 2003 also had the same covenant, and that deed was recorded. So when the builder sold the 40 lots, the question is whether the covenant runs to the buyers from the builder.

Wait, but the builder's deeds to the buyers didn't include the clause. But the original deed from developer to builder did. So does that mean that the covenant is still enforceable against the builder's buyers?

I think when the developer recorded the subdivision plan in 1997, and all the deeds refer to the subdivision, that might create a common scheme. So even if the later deeds don't mention the covenant, the buyers would have constructive notice because the subdivision plan was recorded.

So for the buyer in 2009, even though his deed didn't have the clause, he might still be bound because the original subdivision's restrictions were recorded. Constructive notice means he should have known about the restrictions when he bought the property.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The covenant ran with the land as far as the builder, but not to the buyer. Hmm. The builder's deed had the covenant, and when the builder sold, the buyers take subject to existing covenants if there's a common scheme and the covenant runs. So maybe the covenant does run to the buyer. So if A says it stops at the builder, that might be wrong.

Option B: The covenant could be enforced by any subdivision lot owner. If the covenant is part of a common scheme, then yes, any owner can enforce it against others. So B would be accurate, not the least accurate.

Option C: The buyer had constructive notice. Since the subdivision plan was recorded and the original deeds referred to it, the buyer should have known. So C is accurate, not the least.

Option D: All subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of estate. Vertical privity usually refers to the chain of title. If the builder sells to a buyer, that buyer is in privity with the builder. So D is correct.

So which option is least accurate? Option A says the covenant didn't run to the buyer. But if the covenant was properly recorded and part of a common scheme, it should run. So A is incorrect, making it the least accurate statement.

To determine which statement is least accurate, we analyze the enforceability of the covenant prohibiting mobile homes and the concept of constructive notice.

1. **Option A**: The covenant prohibiting mobile homes ran with the land as far as the builder but not as far as the buyer.  
   This is incorrect because the covenant, being part of a recorded subdivision plan and included in the developer's deed to the builder, would also run with the land to subsequent purchasers (the builder's buyers), provided there is a common scheme and constructive notice. Therefore, the covenant should still apply to the buyer.

2. **Option B**: The covenant prohibiting mobile homes could be enforced by any subdivision lot owner.  
   This is accurate. If the covenant is part of a common scheme and properly recorded, all lot owners in the subdivision can enforce it against each other.

3. **Option C**: The buyer should have had constructive notice of the restriction against mobile homes.  
   This is also accurate. Since the subdivision plan and the developer's deeds were recorded, the buyer would have constructive notice of the covenant, even if it was not explicitly included in their deed.

4. **Option D**: All subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of estate.  
   This is correct. Vertical privity of estate exists between the builder and their grantees, meaning the covenant would still apply to subsequent purchasers.

The least accurate statement is **Option A**, as the covenant would run with the land to the buyer, despite not being explicitly included in their deed.

**Answer: A**
