Okay, so I need to figure out what pure competition means from these options. Let me think about what I remember from economics class.

I recall that pure competition is a market structure where there are a lot of buyers and sellers. Each seller offers a similar product, so the products are homogeneous. Also, there's free entry and exit in the market, meaning new firms can easily join and existing ones can leave without many obstacles.

Looking at the options:

Option A says few buyers and sellers. No, that doesn't sound right because pure competition is about numerous participants.

Option B mentions high barriers to entry. Wait, no, pure competition has low barriers, so new firms can enter freely. So B is the opposite.

Option C talks about a single buyer and multiple sellers. That sounds like monopsony, not pure competition.

Option D is about a single firm dominating, which is more like monopoly.

Option E says firms can charge different prices. But in pure competition, firms are price takers, they can't set different prices because the product is the same. So E is probably not right.

Option F says a handful of firms with control over price. That's more oligopoly, not pure competition.

Option G says firms are price setters. Again, in pure competition, they're price takers because the market sets the price, so G is incorrect.

Option H mentions product differentiation. No, pure competition has homogeneous products, so H is wrong.

Option I has numerous buyers but only one seller. That's monopoly again, not pure competition.

Option J says numerous buyers and sellers, homogeneous product, and free entry. That matches my notes. So J is correct.

Pure competition is a market structure characterized by numerous buyers and sellers, homogeneous products, and free entry into and exit from the market. Among the given options, only Option J accurately describes these characteristics.

Answer: J
