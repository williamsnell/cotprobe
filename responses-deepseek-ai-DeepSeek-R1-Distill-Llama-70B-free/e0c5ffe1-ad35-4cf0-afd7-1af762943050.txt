Okay, so I've got this problem here about Handy Dandy Speakers selling to Tech High-Fi. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is asking for the net price that Tech High-Fi is paying for each set after a trade discount. 

Alright, the given information is that each unit is sold for $299.50, and there's a trade discount of 36%. I remember that trade discounts are reductions in the price, so the net price would be the original price minus the discount amount. 

Wait, right, the formula for the net price after a discount is usually Original Price multiplied by (1 minus the discount rate). So, mathematically, that's Net Price = Original Price Ã— (1 - Discount Rate). 

Let me plug in the numbers. The original price is $299.50, and the discount is 36%, which is 0.36 as a decimal. So I calculate 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. Then, multiply 299.50 by 0.64. 

Wait, let me do that multiplication carefully. 299.50 times 0.64. Maybe I can break it down. 300 times 0.64 is 192, right? Because 300 * 0.6 is 180, and 300 * 0.04 is 12, so 180 +12=192. But since it's 299.50, which is 0.50 less than 300. So 0.50 * 0.64 is 0.32. So subtract 0.32 from 192. That gives 191.68. 

Wait, but let me double-check. Another way: 299.50 * 0.64. Let's do it step by step. 299.50 times 0.6 is 179.70. And 299.50 times 0.04 is 11.98. Adding those together: 179.70 + 11.98 = 191.68. So that's correct. 

Looking at the options, option E is $191.68. So that should be the correct answer. 

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The calculation seems straightforward. The discount applies directly to the original price, so multiplying by (1 - discount) gives the net price.

To determine the net price Tech High-Fi pays for each set after a 36% trade discount, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Net Price} = \text{Original Price} \times (1 - \text{Discount Rate})
\]

Given:
- Original Price = $299.50
- Discount Rate = 36\% = 0.36

First, calculate \(1 - 0.36 = 0.64\). Then, multiply:

\[
299.50 \times 0.64 = 191.68
\]

Thus, the net price is **$191.68**, which corresponds to option E.
