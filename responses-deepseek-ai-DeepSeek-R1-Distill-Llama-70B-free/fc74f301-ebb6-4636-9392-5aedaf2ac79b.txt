Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about sound waves and diffraction. Hmm, I remember that diffraction has something to do with waves bending around obstacles or through openings. The question is about a speaker with a rectangular slit, and we need to find the frequency at which the sound first disappears at a 45-degree angle.

Wait, the problem says the sound disappears at 45 degrees from the normal. I think this is related to the condition for destructive interference in a single-slit diffraction setup. Right, the formula for single-slit diffraction minima is when the path difference is equal to an integer multiple of the wavelength. The formula is something like a sinθ = mλ, where a is the slit width, θ is the angle, m is the order of the minimum, and λ is the wavelength.

Since it's the first disappearance, that should be the first minimum, so m=1. The slit width a is given as 0.14 meters. The speed of sound is 350 m/s. Oh wait, speed v is given, so I can relate frequency f and wavelength λ with v = fλ. 

So putting it all together: first, find λ using the diffraction condition. a sinθ = mλ. Then, λ = a sinθ / m. Once I have λ, I can find f by f = v / λ.

Let me plug in the numbers. a is 0.14 m, θ is 45 degrees, m is 1. Sin(45) is sqrt(2)/2, which is about 0.7071. So λ = (0.14 m) * 0.7071 / 1. Let me calculate that: 0.14 * 0.7071 ≈ 0.099 m, which is 0.099 meters. Wait, no, 0.14 times 0.7071 is approximately 0.09899, so about 0.099 meters.

Wait, wait, no, 0.14 * 0.7071 is 0.098994, so 0.099 meters. Oh wait, wait, 0.14 times 0.7071: let me double-check. 0.14 * 0.7 = 0.098, and 0.14 * 0.0071 is about 0.000994. So yeah, around 0.09899 m.

Then, the speed of sound is 350 m/s. So f = v / λ = 350 / 0.09899. Let me compute that. Hmm, 350 divided by approximately 0.099. Let's see, 350 / 0.1 is 3500, but since it's 0.099, which is slightly less than 0.1, the result will be a bit higher than 3500. Let me calculate it more accurately.

0.09899 is approximately 0.099. So 350 / 0.099. Let's compute 350 * (100/9.9) = 350 * (10 / 0.99) ≈ 350 * 10.101. Because 1/0.99 is approximately 1.0101. So 350 * 10.101 = 350 * 10 is 3500, plus 350 * 0.101 is 35.35, so total is about 3535.35 Hz.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option A is 2750, B is 1750, E is 2500, I is 3000, and J is 4000. Wait, my calculation is about 3535 Hz. Hmm, the closest option is E: 2500 or maybe I:3000. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait. Let me check the formula again. Oh wait, maybe I confused the formula. Wait, for single-slit diffraction, the minima occur when a sinθ = mλ, right. So yes, that's correct. So for m=1, that's the first minimum.

Wait, but wait. When the problem says the sound first disappears, that's the first minimum, so m=1. So the calculation is correct. So f is approximately 3535 Hz. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the numbers. Let me compute 0.14 * sin(45) first. Sin(45) is about 0.7071. So 0.14 * 0.7071 = 0.098994 m. Then, λ = 0.098994 m. Then f = 350 / 0.098994 ≈ 350 / 0.098994. Let me compute this division more accurately.

Let me do 350 divided by 0.098994. Let's compute:

0.098994 * 3535 ≈ 350, as I thought earlier. So 3535 Hz is approximately the frequency.

But looking at the options, the closest is E:2500, which is 2500, H:2000, I:3000, J:4000. 3535 is between 3000 and 4000. Hmm, but wait, maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the units correctly. Wait, the slit width is 0.14 m, which is 14 cm. Sin(45) is about 0.707. So 0.14 * 0.707 is 0.099 m, which is 9.9 cm. So wavelength is 9.9 cm. Then speed is 350 m/s, which is 350,000 cm/s. So frequency f = speed / wavelength = 350,000 cm/s / 9.9 cm. Let's compute that: 350000 / 9.9 ≈ ?

Let me compute 350000 / 10 = 35,000. But 9.9 is 0.1 less than 10, so 350000 /9.9 = 350000 * (1/9.9) ≈ 350000 * 0.10101 ≈ 35,353.5 Hz, which is about 35,354 Hz. So same as before.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Let me see the options again.

Options are:

A:2,750

B:1,750

C:1,000

D:500

E:2,500

F:3,500

G:4,500

H:2,000

I:3,000

J:4,000

Hmm, F is 3,500 Hz. That's very close to my calculation. So why isn't 3,500 an option with approximately 3,500 Hz? Because our calculation is about 3,535 Hz, which is very near to 3,500. So perhaps the intended answer is F:3,500 Hz.

Wait, but in the calculation, I got 3535, which is approximately 3.5 kHz. So option F is 3,500 Hz, which is the closest.

But wait, wait. Let me check the question again. It says the slit is a long rectangular slit 0.14 m across. So that's correct. So my approach is correct.

Wait, but another thought: the formula for first minimum is when a sinθ = λ/2. Wait, no. No, wait, no, the single-slit diffraction minima occur when a sinθ = mλ, where m is 1,2,3,... So for m=1, it's the first minimum. So the formula is correct.

Wait, wait no, I'm confusing with double-slit. No, in single-slit, the minima are at a sinθ = mλ, m=1,2,3. So yes, correct.

So the calculation seems right. But none of the options is exactly 3,535. So the closest is F:3,500. But wait, another thought: is the formula correct? Or is it when the path difference is an odd multiple of half wavelengths, leading to a sinθ = (m + 0.5)λ. Wait, no. No, wait, in single-slit, the central maximum is when the path difference is zero, and the first minimum is when the path is λ times (order m=1). So yes, a sinθ = mλ.

Wait, wait. Maybe I made a mistake in the value of sin(45). Let me calculate it accurately. Sin(45 degrees) is exactly √2/2, which is approx 0.7071067812. So 0.14 times that is 0.14 * 0.7071067812 = let me compute that:

0.1 * 0.7071067812 is 0.07071067812.

0.04 * 0.7071067812 is 0.02828431245.

Adding them together: 0.07071067812 + 0.02828431245 = 0.0989949906 meters.

So λ ≈ 0.0989949906 m.

Then, f = v / λ = 350 / 0.0989949906 ≈ 350 / 0.098995.

Compute 350 divided by 0.098995.

Let me do this division step by step.

0.098995 is approximately 0.099.

350 / 0.099 = ?

Well, 0.099 * 3535 = 350. So 0.099 * 3535 = 350.

So 350 / 0.099 ≈ 3535 Hz.

But the options don't have 3535. So I'm probably missing something. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A:2750

B:1750

C:1000

D:500

E:2500

F:3500

G:4500

H:2000

I:3000

J:4000

So F is 3500, which is very close to 3535. So perhaps the intended answer is F:3500 Hz.

But wait, the question says "at about what frequency". So 3500 is an option, and our calculation is 3535, which is very close. So the answer would be F:3500 Hz.

But wait, another thought: Did I mix up meters and centimeters somewhere? Let me double-check.

Slit width is 0.14 meters, which is 14 cm. Sin(45) is about 0.7071. So a sinθ is 14 cm * 0.7071 ≈ 9.899 cm.

So λ is approximately 9.899 cm, which is 0.09899 meters.

Speed is 350 m/s. So f = 350 / 0.09899 ≈ 3535 Hz, as before.

So the closest option is F:3500 Hz.

But wait, another possibility: maybe the question is asking for the frequency at which destructive interference first occurs, which I've considered. So I think the correct answer is F:3500 Hz.

To solve the problem, we analyze the diffraction of sound waves through a single slit. The condition for the first minimum (destructive interference) in single-slit diffraction is given by:

\[
a \sin\theta = m\lambda
\]

where:
- \(a = 0.14 \, \text{m}\) is the slit width,
- \(\theta = 45^\circ\) is the angle from the normal,
- \(m = 1\) is the order of the minimum (first disappearance),
- \(\lambda\) is the wavelength of the sound.

### Step 1: Solve for \(\lambda\)
Rearranging the formula for \(\lambda\):
\[
\lambda = \frac{a \sin\theta}{m}
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
\sin(45^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \approx 0.7071
\]
\[
\lambda = \frac{0.14 \cdot 0.7071}{1} \approx 0.09899 \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 2: Relate frequency and wavelength
The relationship between the speed of sound (\(v\)), frequency (\(f\)), and wavelength (\(\lambda\)) is:
\[
v = f\lambda \quad \Rightarrow \quad f = \frac{v}{\lambda}
\]

Substitute \(v = 350 \, \text{m/s}\) and \(\lambda \approx 0.09899 \, \text{m}\):
\[
f = \frac{350}{0.09899} \approx 3535 \, \text{Hz}
\]

### Step 3: Compare with the options
The calculated frequency is approximately \(3535 \, \text{Hz}\). Among the given options:
- \(A: 2750 \, \text{Hz}\)
- \(B: 1750 \, \text{Hz}\)
- \(C: 1000 \, \text{Hz}\)
- \(D: 500 \, \text{Hz}\)
- \(E: 2500 \, \text{Hz}\)
- \(F: 3500 \, \text{Hz}\)
- \(G: 4500 \, \text{Hz}\)
- \(H: 2000 \, \text{Hz}\)
- \(I: 3000 \, \text{Hz}\)
- \(J: 4000 \, \text{Hz}\)

The closest option to \(3535 \, \text{Hz}\) is \(F: 3500 \, \text{Hz}\).

### Final Answer:
The frequency at which the sound first disappears at \(45^\circ\) is approximately \(3500 \, \text{Hz}\).
