Okay, so I've got this question about bonds and interest rates. Hmm, let me think through this. The question says there's a bond selling for $1,000, and it pays $80 in annual interest. The monetary authorities predict a 5% increase in the general price level next year. I need to find both the nominal and real interest rates. 

First, the nominal interest rate. I remember that the nominal interest rate is the rate you get before adjusting for inflation. So for a bond, it's usually the coupon rate. The coupon rate is calculated by dividing the annual interest payment by the bond's face value. 

Wait, the face value of the bond is $1,000, right? And the annual payment is $80. So I can calculate the nominal interest rate as (80 / 1000) * 100 to get the percentage. Let me do that math: 80 divided by 1000 is 0.08, which is 8 percent. So the nominal interest rate is 8% per year. 

Okay, that's part a done. Now for part b, the real interest rate. I think the real interest rate is calculated by subtracting the inflation rate from the nominal interest rate. Oh wait, right, the Fisher equation. The formula is (1 + nominal) = (1 + real) * (1 + inflation). But since the inflation is 5%, which is 0.05, and the nominal is 8%, I can rearrange the equation to find the real rate.

So, real rate = (nominal rate / (1 + inflation)) - 1. Alternatively, sometimes it's approximated as nominal minus inflation when the rates are low. Let me try both methods to see if they're similar.

Using the approximation first: 8% minus 5% is 3%. So the real interest rate would be around 3%. 

Let me use the exact formula to check. The Fisher equation is nominal = real + inflation + (real * inflation). Ignoring the last term because it's small (since both rates are in percentages, their product is negligible), so it's roughly nominal ≈ real + inflation. Therefore, real ≈ nominal - inflation. So 8 -5 = 3, same as before. 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because sometimes people just subtract inflation from the nominal to get real. So in this case, 8% -5% is 3% real. So the real interest rate is 3% per year. 

Putting it all together: nominal is 8%, real is 3%. Now I need to look at the options. Let me check each option.

Option A: Nominal 7%, real 2%. No, our nominal is 8.

Option B: Nominal 9%, real 4%. No, both are higher.

Option C: Nominal 5%, real 3%. No, nominal is too low.

Option D: Nominal 7.5, real 2.5. No.

Option E: Nominal 10, real 5. No.

Option F: 6 and 1. No.

Option G: Nominal 8, real 3. Yes, that's what I got.

Option H: 4 and -1. No.

Option I: 8.5, 3.5. Close, but I think nominal is 8.

Option J: 3 and 8. No, that's opposite.

So the correct answer should be option G.

To determine the nominal and real interest rates, we start by calculating the nominal interest rate. The nominal interest rate is the coupon rate, which is calculated as:

\[
\text{Nominal Interest Rate} = \left( \frac{\text{Annual Interest Payment}}{\text{Face Value}} \right) \times 100
\]

Given the annual interest payment is $80 and the face value is $1,000:

\[
\text{Nominal Interest Rate} = \left( \frac{80}{1000} \right) \times 100 = 8\%
\]

Next, to find the real interest rate, we use the relationship between nominal interest rate, real interest rate, and inflation rate. The formula is:

\[
\text{Real Interest Rate} = \text{Nominal Interest Rate} - \text{Inflation Rate}
\]

The inflation rate is given as 5%. Therefore:

\[
\text{Real Interest Rate} = 8\% - 5\% = 3\%
\]

Now, comparing these results with the options provided:

- **Option A**: Nominal = 7%, Real = 2% (Incorrect, as nominal is 8%)
- **Option B**: Nominal = 9%, Real = 4% (Incorrect, as both are too high)
- **Option C**: Nominal = 5%, Real = 3% (Incorrect, as nominal is too low)
- **Option D**: Nominal = 7.5%, Real = 2.5% (Incorrect, as nominal is too low)
- **Option E**: Nominal = 10%, Real = 5% (Incorrect, as both are too high)
- **Option F**: Nominal = 6%, Real = 1% (Incorrect, as both are too low)
- **Option G**: Nominal = 8%, Real = 3% (Correct, matches calculations)
- **Option H**: Nominal = 4%, Real = -1% (Incorrect, as both are too low)
- **Option I**: Nominal = 8.5%, Real = 3.5% (Incorrect, as nominal is too high)
- **Option J**: Nominal = 3%, Real = 8% (Incorrect, as both are opposite)

Thus, the correct answer is **Option G**.
