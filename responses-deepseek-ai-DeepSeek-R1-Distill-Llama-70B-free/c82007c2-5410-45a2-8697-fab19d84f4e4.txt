Question:

Late one night, an accountant walked into a bar and ordered a whiskey sour. The bartender served the drink, even though the accountant looked and acted as though he was already very intoxicated. The accountant soon had consumed five more cocktails, which the bartender served, despite the accountant's obviously and unmistakably drunken condition. After finishing his sixth drink in the bar, the accountant said good night to the bartender, staggered out of the bar, got into his car, and drove away. After weaving back and forth across the road for several blocks, the accountant crashed his car into a pedestrian who was walking on the sidewalk next to the road. The pedestrian suffered serious injuries to his back and legs. The bartender's act of serving drinks to the accountant would most likely be viewed as the

Options:

A: nominal cause of the pedestrian's injuries.
B: intervening cause of the pedestrian's injuries.
C: contributing cause of the pedestrian's injuries.
D: remote cause of the pedestrian's injuries.
E: proximate cause of the pedestrian's injuries.
F: superseding cause of the pedestrian's injuries.
G: incidental cause of the pedestrian's injuries.
H: secondary cause of the pedestrian's injuries.
I: underlying cause of the pedestrian's injuries.
J: direct cause of the pedestrian's injuries.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about tort law, specifically dealing with causation. Hmm, I remember that in torts, causation is a key element. There's actual cause (cause in fact) and proximate cause. 

The question is about a bartender serving drinks to an accountant who was already visibly intoxicated. The accountant then drives and hits a pedestrian. The issue is whether the bartender's actions are the cause of the pedestrian's injuries.

So the options are A through J, each with a different type of cause. I need to figure out which one applies here.

First, I think about cause in fact. The bartender serving the drinks was a cause in fact because without those drinks, the accountant might not have been as intoxicated. But the question is about proximate cause, which is whether the result is a foreseeable consequence of the action.

In many jurisdictions, the Dram Shop Act holds bartenders liable for injuries caused by intoxicated patrons. But sometimes, if the patron's own actions (like driving drunk) are considered the proximate cause, the bartender's liability might be seen as contributing rather than the direct cause.

Wait, the question is asking what the bartender's act would "most likely be viewed as." So the options are about the type of cause.

Looking at the options, proximate cause is E. But sometimes, a defendant's actions can be a contributing factor rather than the direct cause. So, contributing cause is C. But I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the bartender's act is a cause, but is it the proximate cause? Or is it a remote cause because the accountant's driving was the direct cause?

Wait, if the bartender serves someone who is already intoxicated, and that person then causes harm, the bartender can be held liable under dram shop laws because serving an intoxicated person is a foreseeable cause of potential harm. So the act of serving is a proximate cause because the harm is a foreseeable result. So E could be the answer.

But wait, if the accountant was already intoxicated, does that change things? Because he was served six drinks. Wait, the initial order was a whiskey sour, then five more. So he was served multiple drinks. The bartender continued serving despite his drunken state.

So his serving each drink could be contributing to the intoxication. The injury occurred because the accountant drove while intoxicated. So the bartender's actions are a contributing cause because they contributed to the accountant's intoxication, which led to the accident. But the immediate cause was the accountant's driving.

Wait, so the question is whether the bartender's serving is the proximate cause. I think the general rule is that the bartender can be held liable as a proximate cause because the harm is a foreseeable result of serving alcohol to an intoxicated person. So the serving is a proximate cause, making E the answer.

But another angle: the pedestrian's injury was caused by the accountant's driving. So the bartender's act is a contributing cause but not the direct cause. So the answer might be C, contributing cause.

Wait, but in many cases, the dram shop act imposes liability because the serving is a proximate cause. So the correct answer would be E: proximate cause.

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the terminology. Let me think again. Proximate cause is a cause that, in natural and continuous sequence, produces the injury, and without which it wouldn't have happened. It's a direct cause. But when there's an intervening cause, like the accountant's decision to drive, does that supersede the bartender's liability?

Wait, the accountant's act of driving while intoxicated is an intervening cause, but if it's a foreseeable result, then the bartender's liability isn't cut off. So the bartender's serving is a proximate cause. So the answer is E.

But I'm a bit confused because sometimes the answer might be contributing cause instead of proximate. Alternatively, if the serving is a cause that contributed to the injury, but not the direct cause, which would be the driving.

Wait, the question is about how the bartender's act is viewed. If the act is a proximate cause, then E. If it's a contributing cause, then C. But I think in legal terms, the serving is considered a proximate cause because it's a foreseeable result. So the answer should be E.

Alternatively, maybe it's considered a contributing cause because the bartender's act was one of several factors that led to the injury. But I think the correct term is proximate cause because the injury is a foreseeable consequence of serving an intoxicated person.

The question revolves around determining the type of causation for the bartender's actions in serving an intoxicated accountant who later caused injuries to a pedestrian. In tort law, causation includes both cause in fact and proximate cause. The bartender's act of serving drinks was a cause in fact because it contributed to the accountant's intoxication. However, the key issue is whether this act constitutes proximate cause, which requires that the harm was a foreseeable result of the action.

The bartender continued to serve the accountant despite his visibly intoxicated state, which is a violation of Dram Shop Act principles in many jurisdictions. Serving alcohol to an intoxicated individual creates a foreseeable risk of harm, such as the patron driving under the influence and causing an accident. The accountant's decision to drive while intoxicated is an intervening cause, but it does not supersede the bartender's liability because the harm was foreseeable.

Given this, the bartender's act of serving the drinks is most accurately viewed as the **proximate cause** of the pedestrian's injuries, as the harm was a direct and foreseeable consequence of the bartender's actions.
