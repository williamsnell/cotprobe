Question:

What is the difference between discrete andcontinuous motortasks?Which is easier to remember after an interval oftime?

Options:

A: Discrete skills are more difficult to remember due to their complexity
B: Continuous skills require more cognitive effort to recall
C: Neither are easy to remember
D: Continuous skills are not easily forgotten
E: Continuous skills are easier to remember because they are always performed in a consistent environment
F: Continuous skills are more difficult to remember because they are less repetitive
G: Both are equally easy to remember
H: Discrete skills become more precise over time
I: Discrete skills are easier to remember because they involve a sequence of movements
J: Discrete skills are not easily forgotten

Okay, so I have this question about discrete and continuous motor tasks and which is easier to remember after some time. Hmm, I need to figure this out. I remember from my psychology class that motor skills are divided into these two categories, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

Let me start by recalling what each term means. Discrete motor tasks are movements that have a clear beginning and end, right? Like throwing a ball or hitting a golf putt. They're short, well-defined actions. On the other hand, continuous motor tasks are ongoing and don't have a clear start and finish. Examples might be running or cycling, where the movement is repeated over time.

Now, the question is about which type is easier to remember after an interval. I think this relates to how these skills are learned and retained. From what I remember, there's something about how different skills are stored in memory. Discrete skills are often learned through a lot of repetition and practice, which probably makes them stick in the long-term memory better. Continuous tasks might rely more on the body's ability to perform them without much conscious thought, almost like autopilot.

Wait, another angle: when you learn a discrete skill, like tying your shoes, once you get it, you rarely forget. It's a specific sequence of steps. But continuous skills, like riding a bike, you might not think about the individual movements once you're proficient. So after time, which one would be easier to pick up again?

I think continuous skills are easier to remember because they become more automatic. The body just remembers how to do it without much conscious effort. Discrete skills might require a bit more thought each time, especially if you haven't done them in a while. But wait, no, sometimes discrete skills become automatic too. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Oh, right, there's the idea of open and closed skills too, but that's about the environment. Discrete might be closed because they're performed in a consistent environment, while continuous could be more open? Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, discrete is closed, continuous is open maybe.

But the key here is memory retention. I think continuous skills are easier to remember because they're performed in a consistent way each time, so the muscle memory is strong. Or maybe because they're repeated more often, which reinforces the memory. Alternatively, maybe discrete skills, being step-by-step, are easier because each step is a cue for the next.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think of examples. If I learned how to do a specific dance move (discrete), I might forget the exact steps after a while. But if I learned how to swim (continuous), once I know the strokes, I can pick it up again more easily because the movements are repetitive and the body remembers the rhythm.

So continuous skills might be easier to remember because they become more automatic and rely on the body's ability to perform them without much conscious thought. They're like habits. Discrete skills, while they can become automatic, might require more precise steps, so if you forget one step, it could throw off the whole task.

Looking at the options now. Let's go through them:

Option A: Discrete skills are harder to remember because they're complex. I'm not sure about this. They might be complex, but does that make them harder to remember?

Option B: Continuous require more cognitive effort to recall. If they're automatic, maybe they require less effort, so this might not be right.

Option D: Continuous skills are not easily forgotten. That sounds plausible, as they're more automatic.

Option E: Continuous are easier because consistent environment. Maybe, but I'm not sure about the environment part being the key reason.

Option I: Discrete are easier because they involve a sequence. That could make sense because each step cues the next, aiding memory.

Option J: Discrete are not easily forgotten. So which is it?

Wait, I remember that continuous skills are considered easier to retain over time. Because once you master them, like riding a bike, you don't forget. Discrete skills might require more conscious thought each time, so they might be a bit harder to recall if you haven't done them in a while.

So looking back, the question is which is easier to remember after time. If continuous skills are more automatic and thus easier, then the answer would be continuous.

Looking at the options, option D says "Continuous skills are not easily forgotten" which fits. Option E says they're easier because of a consistent environment, but I'm not sure if that's the main reason. I think the automaticity is the key.

So the correct answer should be D or E. Wait, the initial reasoning about continuous being easier is because they're automatic. So option D says they're not easily forgotten, which aligns.

Now, looking at the options, the correct answer is D. So the answer is D.

The question asks about the difference between discrete and continuous motor tasks and which is easier to remember after an interval of time. Discrete motor tasks are short, well-defined actions with a clear beginning and end, such as throwing a ball. Continuous motor tasks, on the other hand, are ongoing and repetitive, like running or cycling.

Continuous motor tasks are generally easier to remember over time because they become automatic and rely on muscle memory. Once mastered, these skills are retained without much conscious effort, making them less likely to be forgotten. Discrete skills, while they can also become automatic, often involve specific sequences or steps, which might require more conscious recall if not performed regularly.

Among the options provided, the correct answer is that continuous skills are not easily forgotten due to their automatic nature.

Answer: D
