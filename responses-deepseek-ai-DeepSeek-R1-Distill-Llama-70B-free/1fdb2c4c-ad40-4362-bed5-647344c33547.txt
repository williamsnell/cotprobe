Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Whorfian hypothesis, also known as linguistic relativity. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which option the Whorfian hypothesis helps explain. The options are A through H, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I remember that the Whorfian hypothesis is about how the language we speak influences the way we think. So, it's the idea that language shapes thought, right? Like, if a language has certain features, its speakers might perceive the world differently.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Some languages are tonal while others are not. I think this is more about the structure of languages, maybe phonetics or phonology. Whorf is more about how language affects thought, not why languages have different features themselves.

Option B: Humans can create new words. That's about language productivity, how we can coin new terms. I don't think that's related to the hypothesis, which is more about the influence of existing language on cognition.

Option C: Phonemes vs. morphemes. That's a linguistic distinction, maybe about how sounds and meaning units work. Doesn't seem connected to the hypothesis's main point.

Option D: People can understand multiple languages. That's about bilingualism or multilingualism. Whorf's hypothesis doesn't directly explain that ability; it's more about how language affects thought.

Option E: Cultures develop different languages. Hmm, but the hypothesis is about how language affects culture or thought, not why languages are different. So maybe not E.

Option F: Eskimos have many words for snow. Oh wait, I remember this example being tied to the Whorfian hypothesis. The idea is that because they have multiple words for different types of snow, they can think about snow in more nuanced ways than speakers of other languages. So this illustrates linguistic relativity because their language's vocabulary influences their perception of snow.

Option G: Parents use high-pitched voices with infants. That's about speech patterns in child-directed speech, maybe related to language acquisition, but I don't see the connection to Whorf's hypothesis.

Option H: English as a universal language. That's more about language spread and globalization, not about how language influences thought.

So putting it together, the Whorfian hypothesis would explain why a culture has many specific words for a particular concept because their language influences their perception. So the correct answer should be F.
</think>

The Whorfian hypothesis, or linguistic relativity, suggests that the language we speak influences the way we think and perceive the world. Among the options provided, the hypothesis best explains why a culture might develop many specific words for a particular concept, as this reflects how language shapes perception. For example, the idea that Eskimos have numerous words for snow aligns with the hypothesis, as their language's vocabulary allows for a more nuanced understanding of snow. This directly illustrates how language influences thought and perception.

Answer: F
