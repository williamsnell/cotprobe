Okay, so I have this question about finding the current through a light bulb's filament. The question gives me the resistance of the bulb as 240 ohms and the voltage applied is 120 volts. I remember from my basic physics classes that Ohm's Law is involved here. Ohm's Law relates voltage, current, and resistance.

Wait, what's Ohm's Law again? Oh right, it's V=I*R, where V is voltage, I is current, and R is resistance. So if I have V and R, I can rearrange the formula to solve for I, the current.

So the formula should be I = V / R. Plugging in the numbers, the voltage is 120 volts, and the resistance is 240 ohms. Let me do the calculation: 120 divided by 240. Hmm, 120 divided by 240 is 0.5. Wait, 240 divided by 120 is 2, so 120 divided by 240 should be 0.5. Oh wait, no, 120 divided by 240 is actually 0.5? Let me double-check that. 240 times 0.5 is 120, yes. So I think I'm right.

Looking at the options, option G is 0.5 ampere. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but I should make sure I didn't mix up the numbers. The resistance is higher than the voltage here. So with a higher resistance, the current should be lower. Since 240 is double 120, the current would be half of 120/120, which is 1 ampere. Oh wait, no, wait. If V is 120 and R is 240, 120/240 is 0.5. So yeah, 0.5 ampere.

I think I'm confident that the correct answer is G: 0.5 ampere.

To determine the current through the filament of the light bulb, we use Ohm's Law, which states:

\[ V = I \cdot R \]

Rearranging for current \( I \):

\[ I = \frac{V}{R} \]

Given \( V = 120 \, \text{volts} \) and \( R = 240 \, \text{ohms} \), we calculate:

\[ I = \frac{120}{240} = 0.5 \, \text{amperes} \]

Thus, the current is 0.5 amperes, corresponding to option G.

Answer: G
