Okay, so I have this question about warranties in sales, right? The question is a bit tricky, but I think I can work through it. Let me read it again.

The buyer bought an item from a merchant, and it turns out to be unfit, defective, and unsafe for its ordinary purposes. The question is asking which warranty the buyer can invoke, and there are several options provided.

I remember from my studies that there are different types of warranties under the law, especially under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) in the US. The main ones that come to mind are the implied warranty of merchantability and the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.

So, the key here is that the item is unfit for its ordinary purpose. That sounds like it's about whether the product is suitable for what it's normally used for. I think the warranty of merchantability is the one that deals with that. Merchantability means the goods are fit for their ordinary purpose.

Let me think about the options. Option C is the warranty of merchantability. Option F is fitness for a particular purpose, which I think applies when the buyer has a specific use in mind that the seller knew about. Since the question says "ordinary purposes," that points more to merchantability.

Other options: warranty of title (A) is about ownership, so that's probably not relevant here. Implied warranty (B) is a broader category, but I think the specific one here is merchantability.

Warranty of suitability (D) sounds similar, but I'm not sure if that's a standard term. I think it's more about fitness for a particular purpose. Warranty of non-infringement (E) is about patents and such, so not relevant. Express warranty (H) would be if the seller made specific promises, but the question says no other warranties, so I guess there's no express warranty here.

Warranty of safety (I) and durability (G) might be parts of merchantability, but I think merchantability is the exact term they're looking for. Warranty of quality (J) is vague and probably part of merchantability.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be C: Warranty of merchantability.

The question involves a buyer purchasing an item that is unfit, defective, and unsafe for its ordinary purposes. Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), the relevant warranty here is the **implied warranty of merchantability**, which ensures that goods are fit for their ordinary purposes. This aligns with the scenario described, as the item fails to meet the basic expectations of usability for its intended purpose. Other options like warranty of title, fitness for a particular purpose, or express warranties do not apply in this context. 

Answer: C
