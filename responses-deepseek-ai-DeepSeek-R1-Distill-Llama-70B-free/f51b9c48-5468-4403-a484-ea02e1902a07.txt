Question:

A ski resort had a lift that carried customers from the bottom to the top of the ski slope. One afternoon, the lift suddenly broke down because of a power failure in the area. A customer was suspended in his lift chair, one-third of the way up the hill and 50 feet above the ground. The customer remained on the lift for five hours until power was restored. He was then returned uninjured to the bottom of the hill. In a suit against the ski resort, the customer is likely to have action for

B: assault.
C: false imprisonment.
D: invasion of privacy.
E: negligence.
F: battery.
G: breach of contract.
H: defamation.
I: no cause of action.
J: trespass.

Okay, so I've got this question about a ski resort and a customer who got stuck on a lift. I'm a bit new to tort law, but I'll try to think through this step by step.

First, let me read the question again. The lift broke down because of a power failure, and the customer was left suspended one-third up the hill, 50 feet above the ground. He stayed there for five hours until the power came back. Then, he was returned safely without injury. He's suing the ski resort, and I need to figure out which legal action he might have.

The options are from A to J, each a different legal concept. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Intentional infliction of emotional distress. Hmm, IIED requires intentional or reckless conduct causing severe emotional distress. But here, the power failure was accidental, not intentional. The resort didn't mean for the lift to break down, so probably not IIED.

Option B: Assault. Assault is when someone causes apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact. But the customer was just stuck; no one was threatening him. So assault doesn't fit here.

Option C: False imprisonment. That's when someone is confined against their will. The customer was stuck on the lift, so he couldn't leave. But was it the resort's intentional act? The breakdown was due to a power failure, which the resort likely didn't cause. So maybe not false imprisonment.

Option D: Invasion of privacy. I don't see how being stuck on a lift would relate to privacy issues. He was in a public place, so probably not.

Option E: Negligence. This is a possible option. The resort has a duty to ensure the lift is safe. If the power failure was due to their negligence, like poor maintenance, then they could be liable. But the question says it was a power failure in the area, which might not be the resort's fault. Unless the resort should have had backup power or something.

Option F: Battery. Battery is intentional harmful or offensive contact. Again, the situation was accidental, so no intent here. Not battery.

Option G: Breach of contract. The customer paid for the lift service, and maybe the contract included safe transport. If the resort failed to provide that, it's a breach. But the question doesn't specify, so it's possible but not the strongest option.

Option H: Defamation. That's about harming someone's reputation, which doesn't apply here.

Option I: No cause of action. Maybe if the resort wasn't at fault. The power failure was an external issue, but maybe the resort is still responsible for not having a proper backup system.

Option J: Trespass. Trespass involves unauthorized entry onto property or interference with personal property. Doesn't seem to fit here since the issue was the lift stopping.

So, thinking further, the ski resort might have a duty of care to ensure their equipment is functioning properly. If the lift breaking down was due to their negligence, like not maintaining it properly, then they could be liable for negligence. However, if the power outage was something beyond their control, like a grid failure they couldn't predict, maybe they aren't negligent.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify the cause of the power failure. It just says a power failure in the area. So the resort might not be directly at fault. Unless they should have had backup generators, which they didn't. That could be a point of negligenceâ€”failure to provide a safe and reliable service.

Alternatively, if the customer was stuck, maybe they were falsely imprisoned. But false imprisonment requires intent or knowing confinement. The resort didn't cause the breakdown on purpose, so it's more about whether they took reasonable steps to rescue him quickly. They did get him down after five hours, but maybe they were negligent in how they handled the situation.

Wait, but the customer wasn't confined by the resort's intentional act. The lift stopping was an accident. So false imprisonment might not apply. I think the better option here is negligence because the resort had a duty to ensure the lift operates safely and could have failed in that duty, leading to the breakdown and the customer's entrapment.

So among the options, E (negligence) seems the most fitting. The resort could have been negligent in maintaining the lift, leading to the breakdown. Even if the power failure was external, maybe the resort should have had a backup system to prevent such an incident. Or perhaps they didn't respond quickly enough, which could also be negligence.

Therefore, the customer likely has an action for negligence against the resort.

The customer was stuck on the ski lift due to a power failure, remaining suspended for five hours before being safely returned. To determine the appropriate legal action, we analyze the options:

- **Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED)**: This requires intentional or reckless conduct causing severe emotional distress. The power failure was accidental, not intentional, so IIED does not apply.  
- **Assault**: Assault involves apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact. The customer was not threatened, so this does not fit.  
- **False Imprisonment**: This involves confinement against one's will. While the customer was confined, the resort did not intentionally cause the breakdown, making this less likely.  
- **Invasion of Privacy**: This is unrelated, as the customer was in a public place.  
- **Negligence**: The resort has a duty to ensure safe operation of the lift. If the breakdown was due to poor maintenance or lack of backup systems, negligence applies.  
- **Battery**: This requires intentional harmful contact, which is absent here.  
- **Breach of Contract**: While possible, the question does not specify contractual terms, making this less clear.  
- **Defamation**: This involves harm to reputation, which is irrelevant.  
- **No Cause of Action**: Unlikely if the resort was negligent in maintaining the lift or responding to the breakdown.  
- **Trespass**: This involves unauthorized entry or interference with property, which does not apply here.  

The most fitting option is **negligence**, as the resort may have failed in its duty to ensure the lift's safe operation, such as by not having backup systems or responding inadequately.
