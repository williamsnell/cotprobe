Okay, so I've got this question about Stonehenge and some analysis of animal teeth from a nearby village. Hmm, I remember that Stonehenge is this ancient monument in England, and people have done a lot of research about the people who built it. The question is specifically about what we know based on animal teeth analysis. 

Let me think... I've heard that archaeologists study animal remains to understand the diet and lifestyle of ancient people. So, animal teeth can tell us if they were hunters or had domesticated animals. If they had domesticated animals, that suggests they were raising livestock, maybe for meat or other products.

Looking at the options, some options talk about domesticated animals. Option F says they raised livestock like cattle, sheep, and goats at the site. That makes sense because I remember reading that the people around Stonehenge were farmers and herders. They probably kept these animals for food, which would mean they had a steady meat supply.

Option E says they brought animals from outside the region. I'm not sure about that. Maybe during certain times, but if the teeth are from a nearby village, perhaps the animals were local. 

Option C mentions breeding a specific deer species. I don't recall that being the case. Deer are more associated with hunting, and if they were domesticating them, that's a bit unusual for that period in Britain.

Option B suggests they had domesticated animals but didn't eat the meat. That seems unlikely because why raise animals if not for food? Unless for milk or hides, but the question is about meat consumption.

Option A says no domesticated animals, so they hunted. But I think the people around Stonehenge were agricultural, so they probably had domesticated animals.

Option D is vegetarian, but that doesn't fit with the idea of having animal teeth. If they didn't eat meat, why have so many animal remains?

Options G, H, I, and J talk about other animals like antelope, gazelle, bear, exotic imports, aquatic animals, or large game. But Stonehenge is in a region where these might not have been common. Mammoths were probably extinct by then, so J is out. G and H don't seem right because those animals aren't typical for the area.

So putting it all together, the analysis of teeth would show that they had domesticated animals like cattle, sheep, goats. So the answer should be F.

The analysis of animal teeth from a nearby village suggests that the people who built Stonehenge likely raised livestock such as cattle, sheep, and goats. This indicates they were not solely hunters but had a domesticated animal supply, which aligns with their agricultural lifestyle. 

Answer: F
