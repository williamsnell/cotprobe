Question:

Two power line construction routes are being considered. Route A is 15 miles long and goes around a lake. Each mile will cost $6,000 to build and $2,000 a year to maintain. At the end of fifteen years, each mile will have a salvage value of $3,000. Route B is an underwater line that cuts 5 miles across the lake. Construction costs will be $31,000 per mile and annual maintenance costs, $400 per mile. The salvage value at the end of fifteen years will be $6,000 per mile. Assuming interest is 8% and taxes are 3% of the construction costs of each power line, compare the annual costs of Route A and Route B for the first year.

Options:

A: $41,558 for Route A and $23,654 for Route B
B: $45,000 for Route A and $30,000 for Route B
C: $100,000 for Route A and $50,000 for Route B
D: $40,000 for Route A and $20,000 for Route B
E: $80,000 for Route A and $40,000 for Route B
F: $35,000 for Route A and $25,000 for Route B
G: $70,000 for Route A and $35,000 for Route B
H: $60,000 for Route A and $155,000 for Route B
I: $90,000 for Route A and $155,000 for Route B
J: $120,000 for Route A and $75,000 for Route B

Okay, so I have this problem about two power line construction routes, A and B. I need to compare their annual costs for the first year. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on accounting and engineering economics, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, let me understand what each route entails. Route A is 15 miles long, going around the lake. Each mile costs $6,000 to build and $2,000 a year to maintain. At the end of 15 years, each mile has a salvage value of $3,000. Route B is an underwater line, shorter, only 5 miles across the lake. Construction is more expensive at $31,000 per mile, but annual maintenance is cheaper at $400 per mile. Salvage value after 15 years is $6,000 per mile.

Wait, but the question is about the first year's annual costs. So I think I need to calculate the total cost for each route in the first year, which includes construction costs, maintenance, and perhaps taxes, but I'm not sure about how the interest and taxes factor in.

Oh, the question mentions that interest is 8% and taxes are 3% of the construction costs of each power line. So I probably need to consider these in the annual cost.

Wait, but the problem says to compare the annual costs for the first year. So I'm thinking that for each route, the first-year cost includes the initial construction cost plus the first year's maintenance, but adjusted for interest and taxes.

Wait, no, maybe not. Because taxes are a percentage of construction costs, so for each route, the tax would be 3% of the total construction cost, but is that a one-time tax or annual? The question says taxes are 3% of the construction costs. So I think it's a one-time tax. But wait, the question says "compare the annual costs", so I'm not entirely sure if the tax is a one-time payment or yearly. Hmm, tricky.

Wait, the question says "taxes are 3% of the construction costs of each power line." So that's a one-time tax when the construction happens. So in the first year, perhaps we have the construction cost, plus the tax on that, plus the annual maintenance, but I'm not sure about the interest part.

Wait, but the problem says to assume interest is 8%. Oh, right! So we probably need to calculate the equivalent annual cost using the interest rate. But wait, the question is about the first year's cost. So maybe I should consider the initial outlay plus the interest and the first year's expenses.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the annual worth of the total costs, considering the time value of money. But the question specifically says "compare the annual costs of Route A and Route B for the first year." So maybe it's the initial cost plus the first year's expenses, including interest and taxes.

Wait, taxes are 3% of construction costs. So for each route, the tax would be 3% of the total construction cost. So that's a one-time expense in the first year, I think. So for Route A, the total construction cost is 15 miles * $6,000 = $90,000. Taxes would be 3% of that, so $2,700. For Route B, construction is 5 miles * $31,000 = $155,000. Taxes would be 3% of that, which is $4,650.

Now, the interest is 8%. I'm not entirely sure how to apply this. Since the project is being financed, perhaps we have to consider the interest on the construction cost. So maybe the total initial cost is construction plus taxes, and then the interest is calculated on that amount for the first year.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest is the cost of capital, so maybe we use the interest to find the present worth or something. But since the question is about the first year, maybe it's simpler: the initial cost (construction + taxes) plus interest on that initial cost for the first year, plus the annual maintenance.

But wait, taxes are paid at the start, so the initial outlay is construction cost plus tax. Then, the interest would be on that initial outlay. So for the first year, the interest is 8% of (construction cost + tax). Also, the maintenance cost is a separate annual expense.

So putting it all together, for each route, the first year's cost would be:

Initial outlay (construction + tax) + interest on initial outlay + annual maintenance.

Wait, but that might not be accurate. Because perhaps the interest is applied over the project's life, but the question is about the first year's cost. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as the initial cost, including taxes, and then calculate the interest for the first year. Alternatively, perhaps the initial outlay is construction plus taxes, and then the interest is 8% of that initial outlay, added as a cost each year.

Wait, but the problem is about annual costs. So perhaps each year, the interest is 8% of the initial investment. So the first year's cost would be the initial outlay (construction + tax) plus interest on that amount for the first year, plus the annual maintenance.

Wait, but let me think again. If I have a total initial cost of, say, X, then the interest for the first year would be 8% of X. So for Route A:

Construction cost: 15 * 6000 = $90,000.
Tax: 3% of 90,000 = $2,700.
So initial outlay = 90,000 + 2,700 = $92,700.
Interest for first year: 8% of 92,700 = 7,416.
Annual maintenance: 15 * 2000 = $30,000.
So total first year cost: 92,700 (initial) + 7,416 (interest) + 30,000 (maintenance) = 130,116?

Wait, but wait, the initial outlay is a one-time cost, so maybe the interest applies over the life. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the interest is part of the annual cost as the cost of capital, so the annual cost would include the maintenance, plus the interest on the initial investment.

Hmm, perhaps that's the case. So the annual cost is the maintenance plus the interest on the initial investment, plus the tax (which is a one-time cost, so maybe it's considered as part of the initial investment and thus included in the interest calculation).

Wait, but the tax is 3% of the construction cost. So for Route A, the initial cost is 90,000 construction + 2,700 tax = 92,700. The interest on that would be 8% per year. So each year, the interest cost is 0.08 * 92,700 = 7,416.

So the annual cost for Route A would be the annual maintenance (15 * 2000 = 30,000) plus the interest (7,416) plus any other costs. But wait, the initial outlay is a one-time cost, so perhaps the first year's cost includes the initial outlay plus interest, but that doesn't make sense because the initial outlay is a capital expense, not an annual expense.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think differently. The problem says "compare the annual costs of Route A and Route B for the first year." So perhaps the annual costs include all the expenses incurred in the first year, which would be:

- Construction cost
- Taxes
- First year's maintenance
- Interest on the initial investment for the first year.

But that would make the first year's cost very high, but let's try that.

For Route A:

Construction: 15 * 6000 = 90,000.
Tax: 3% of 90,000 = 2,700.
Maintenance: 15 * 2000 = 30,000.
Interest on initial investment (construction + tax) for the first year: 8% of (90,000 + 2,700) = 8% of 92,700 = 7,416.

So total first year cost: 90,000 + 2,700 + 30,000 + 7,416 = 130,116.

Wait, but that seems way higher than any of the options provided. The options are in the range of 20k to 155k. So maybe I'm misunderstanding how to apply the interest.

Alternatively, maybe the interest is not applied to the initial investment but is the cost of capital, so perhaps the annual cost is calculated as the equivalent annual cost considering the interest, but that's usually over the project's life.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the annual worth of the total costs, including initial costs, maintenance, and salvage. But the question specifically says for the first year, so maybe it's just the first year's expenses, not considering the entire project's life.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the initial cost, then add the first year's maintenance and the interest on the initial cost for that year. But then, the initial cost is a capital expense, so perhaps it's not expensed in the first year entirely. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe I should break it down. Let's consider each component:

1. Construction Cost: This is a one-time expense at the beginning. So for the first year, this is a cost. But in accounting terms, construction costs are capitalized, not expensed immediately. However, if the question is about cash flow, maybe the construction cost is paid in the first year.

2. Taxes: 3% of construction cost, so also a one-time expense in the first year.

3. Annual Maintenance: This is an operating expense each year, including the first.

4. Interest: Since the money is borrowed to build, the interest on the loan would start accruing from the first year. So the interest would be on the initial amount borrowed (construction cost + tax), calculated at 8% per annum.

Wait, so perhaps the first year's cash outflow includes:

- Construction cost
- Taxes (3% of construction)
- Interest for the first year on the total initial investment (construction + tax)
- Maintenance for the first year.

But that would make the first year's total cost: construction + tax + interest + maintenance.

Let me compute that for Route A:

Construction: 15 * 6000 = 90,000.
Tax: 0.03 * 90,000 = 2,700.
Interest: 0.08 * (90,000 + 2,700) = 0.08 * 92,700 = 7,416.
Maintenance: 15 * 2000 = 30,000.

Total first year cost: 90,000 + 2,700 + 7,416 + 30,000 = 130,116.

But looking at the options, the highest is 155,000, but that's for Route B in option I. Hmm, but my calculation for Route A is 130k, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I'm doing something wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the interest is applied only to the construction cost, excluding taxes. Let me try that.

Interest for Route A: 0.08 * 90,000 = 7,200.
Then total first year cost: 90,000 (construction) + 2,700 (tax) + 7,200 (interest) + 30,000 (maintenance) = 129,900.

Still, that's not matching the options. So maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't considering the initial construction cost as an expense in the first year, but rather as a capital cost that's depreciated over time. But the question is about comparing annual costs, so maybe it's not considering depreciation. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the interest is calculated on the initial investment, and the annual cost is the interest plus maintenance. But then, the initial investment is construction plus tax, so:

For Route A:

Interest: 0.08 * (90,000 + 2,700) = 7,416.
Maintenance: 30,000.
So annual cost: 7,416 + 30,000 = 37,416.

But none of the options match that.

Wait, looking at the options, option F is $35,000 for Route A and $25,000 for Route B. Close, but not exact. Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the taxes are treated as part of the construction cost, so the initial investment is higher, and the interest is calculated on that. But I already included that.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't considering the salvage value in the first year's cost. Salvage value is at the end of 15 years, so it doesn't affect the first year.

Alternatively, maybe the problem wants to compute the equivalent annual cost, considering the initial investment, maintenance, and salvage, but over the 15-year period. But the question is about the first year's annual cost, so maybe that's not it.

Wait, maybe I should use the present worth approach. The present worth of all costs over 15 years, then find the annual equivalent. But the question is specifically about the first year's cost, so perhaps that's not necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the first year's cash outlay, which would include construction, taxes, and first year's maintenance, but not the interest, because interest is a financing cost. Or maybe the interest is part of the annual cost.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the total initial cost (construction + tax) and then the annual maintenance, with interest being the cost of capital, so the annual cost is maintenance plus interest on the initial investment.

So for Route A:

Initial investment: 90,000 + 2,700 = 92,700.
Interest per year: 0.08 * 92,700 = 7,416.
Maintenance per year: 30,000.
Total annual cost: 7,416 + 30,000 = 37,416.

For Route B:

Construction: 5 * 31,000 = 155,000.
Tax: 0.03 * 155,000 = 4,650.
Initial investment: 155,000 + 4,650 = 159,650.
Interest per year: 0.08 * 159,650 = 12,772.
Maintenance per year: 5 * 400 = 2,000.
Total annual cost: 12,772 + 2,000 = 14,772.

So Route A would be approximately $37,416 and Route B around $14,772. But looking at the options, none of them match exactly. The closest I can see is option F: Route A $35k, Route B $25k. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the tax is applied after the interest. No, the tax is 3% of the construction cost, so it's part of the initial investment. Alternatively, maybe the interest is calculated only on the construction cost, not including tax. Let me try that.

For Route A:

Interest on construction only: 0.08 * 90,000 = 7,200.
Tax: 2,700.
Maintenance: 30,000.
So total annual cost: 7,200 (interest) + 30,000 (maintenance) + 2,700 (tax) = 39,900.

Hmm, but that's still not matching any options. Maybe the tax is a one-time expense, so perhaps it's not part of the annual cost. So perhaps the annual cost is only interest on the initial investment (construction + tax) plus maintenance.

So for Route A:

Initial investment: 90,000 + 2,700 = 92,700.
Interest: 0.08 * 92,700 = 7,416.
Maintenance: 30,000.
Total: 7,416 + 30,000 = 37,416.

For Route B:

Initial investment: 155,000 + 4,650 = 159,650.
Interest: 0.08 * 159,650 = 12,772.
Maintenance: 2,000.
Total: 12,772 + 2,000 = 14,772.

Again, not matching any options. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, maybe the problem doesn't consider the initial construction cost as an expense in the first year, but only the interest and maintenance. Because construction is a capital expense, not an operational expense. So the annual cost would be the interest on the construction cost plus the annual maintenance, plus the tax as a one-time cost in the first year.

But that would make Route A's first year cost: 7,416 (interest) + 30,000 (maintenance) + 2,700 (tax) = 40,116.

And Route B's first year cost: 12,772 (interest) + 2,000 (maintenance) + 4,650 (tax) = 19,422.

Looking at the options, option A is $41,558 for A and $23,654 for B. That's close to what I have here, but not exact. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the interest. Let me re-calculate the interest accurately.

For Route A:

Construction: 15 * 6,000 = 90,000.
Tax: 0.03 * 90,000 = 2,700.
Initial investment: 90,000 + 2,700 = 92,700.
Interest: 92,700 * 0.08 = let's compute that: 92,700 * 0.08 = (90,000 * 0.08) + (2,700 * 0.08) = 7,200 + 216 = 7,416.

Maintenance: 15 * 2,000 = 30,000.

So first year cost: 7,416 (interest) + 30,000 (maintenance) + 2,700 (tax) = 40,116.

But option A is $41,558 for Route A. Hmm, that's a difference of about $1,442. Maybe I made a mistake in the tax calculation. Wait, the tax is 3% of the construction cost, which is correct as 2,700.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest is compounded annually, but for the first year, it's simple interest, so it's correct as 7,416.

Wait, maybe I'm including the tax as an annual cost when it's a one-time cost. So perhaps the first year's cost should include the tax as a one-time expense, while the interest is on the initial investment, which includes the tax.

So Route A's first year cost would be 7,416 (interest) + 30,000 (maintenance) + 2,700 (tax) = 40,116.

Route B:

Construction: 5 * 31,000 = 155,000.
Tax: 0.03 * 155,000 = 4,650.
Initial investment: 155,000 + 4,650 = 159,650.
Interest: 159,650 * 0.08 =
