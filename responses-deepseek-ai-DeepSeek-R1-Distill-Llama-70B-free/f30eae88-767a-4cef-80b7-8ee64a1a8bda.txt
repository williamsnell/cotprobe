Okay, I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about neurotic symptoms and their relation to anxiety relief. Let me break it down step by step.

The question is: If a symptom does not succeed in relieving anxiety, does the neurotic discard it? The options are A through E, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I should understand the terms involved. A neurotic symptom, I believe, refers to psychological symptoms that are part of neurotic disorders, which are typically distressing but not as severe as psychotic symptoms. These symptoms often serve some psychological function, maybe as a defense mechanism.

Anxiety relief is key here. So, the symptom's purpose is to reduce anxiety. If the symptom isn't effective, what happens then? Do neurotics stop using it, or do they keep it anyway?

I remember from psychology that defense mechanisms can be either effective or ineffective. If a defense mechanism (like a symptom) isn't helping, the person might still hold onto it because it's part of their coping strategy, even if it's not working well. Alternatively, maybe they discard it and find another way to cope.

Option A says the neurotic discards them. So, if the symptom doesn't work, they get rid of it. Option E says the opposite, that they don't discard them. Option B is about seeking additional solutions while keeping the current ones. Option C says they ignore them, which doesn't make sense because the symptom is part of their behavior. Option D suggests they're unaware, but I think neurotics are aware of their symptoms, even if they don't understand the underlying cause.

From what I recall, neurotic symptoms are persistent. Even if they don't fully relieve anxiety, they might still provide some temporary relief or serve as a habitual way of coping. So the neurotic might not discard them because they don't have a better alternative, or because the symptom is deeply ingrained.

Wait, another angle: In psychoanalytic theory, symptoms often have multiple functions. Even if they don't fully alleviate anxiety, they might serve other purposes, like channeling the anxiety into a specific behavior that's less harmful than the anxiety itself. So the symptom persists because it's still serving some function, even if imperfectly.

So if the symptom isn't effective, the neurotic wouldn't necessarily discard it. They might keep trying the same symptom because it's familiar or because they don't see another way. Alternatively, they might develop new symptoms alongside it.

Looking at the options again, option E says the neurotic does not discard them. That aligns with my reasoning because the symptom remains even if it's not fully effective.

Wait, but what about option B? It says the neurotic accepts them but seeks additional solutions. That could also make sense because maybe they keep the ineffective symptom and add more strategies. But the question is specifically about discarding the symptom if it doesn't work. If the symptom isn't discarded, then E would be correct. But if the symptom is kept and more solutions are sought, that's B.

I'm a bit torn. Let me think again. If the symptom doesn't relieve anxiety, does the person discard it? Or do they keep it and try other things too.

In many cases, people with neurotic symptoms might not discard them easily because the symptoms are part of their psychological structure. They might continue using the same defense mechanisms even if they're not fully effective, perhaps because changing them is difficult or because they don't have alternatives.

So, the neurotic doesn't discard the symptom just because it's ineffective; instead, they might retain it and perhaps develop more symptoms. So the answer would be E: the neurotic does not discard them.

Wait, but another thought: maybe the symptom's persistence is because it's an attempt to cope, even if unsuccessful. So they wouldn't discard it because it's their way of trying to deal with anxiety, even if it's not working. Hence, E makes sense.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is E.

The question asks whether a neurotic discards a symptom if it fails to relieve anxiety. Neurotic symptoms often serve as coping mechanisms, even if they are ineffective. They may persist because they are deeply ingrained or provide some form of temporary relief, even if imperfect. The neurotic is unlikely to discard such symptoms easily, as they are part of their psychological structure. Instead, they may retain these symptoms and possibly develop additional ones. 

Analyzing the options:
- **A** suggests discarding, which is unlikely as symptoms are persistent.
- **B** implies seeking additional solutions while keeping the symptom, which is possible but not directly addressing whether the symptom is discarded.
- **C** suggests ignoring, which doesn't fit as symptoms are part of the neurotic's behavior.
- **D** implies unawareness, which is incorrect as neurotics are typically aware of their symptoms.
- **E** states the symptom is not discarded, aligning with the persistence of symptoms despite ineffectiveness.

Thus, the correct answer is **E**, as neurotics do not discard symptoms that fail to relieve anxiety.

Answer: E
