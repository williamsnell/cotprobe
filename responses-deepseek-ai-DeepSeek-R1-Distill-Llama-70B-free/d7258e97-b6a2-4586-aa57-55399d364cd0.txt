Question:

A reliable police informant telephoned the police to report seeing two men in a blue car selling narcotics outside a local movie theater. The informant gave a detailed description of the two men and the license number of the vehicle. A patrol car was immediately dispatched to the movie theater. A few minutes later, the police saw a car matching the description given parked about two blocks from the movie theater. When the police approached, they saw one man fitting the description provided. The police proceeded to the car and opened the doors of the vehicle. The police then pried open a locked tool case that was situated in the rear of the vehicle. Inside, the police found an envelope that contained about one gram of cocaine. They then placed the driver of the vehicle under arrest. Immediately thereafter, the police opened the glove compartment and found a small amount of marijuana. The driver of the van was subsequently prosecuted and charged with two counts of possession of controlled dangerous substances. He filed a motion to exclude the cocaine and marijuana from evidence. His motion will most likely be

Options:

A: granted, as to the cocaine only.
B: denied, but only as to the marijuana.
C: granted, as to both the cocaine and the marijuana.
D: granted, because the police didn't have probable cause to search the vehicle.
E: denied, as to the cocaine and the marijuana.
F: denied, because the police had probable cause to search the vehicle.
G: denied, but only as to the cocaine.
H: granted, because the police didn't have a warrant to search the vehicle.
I: granted, as to the marijuana only.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about a police search and seizure. Let's break it down step by step. 

First, the scenario: A reliable police informant called and said two men in a blue car were selling narcotics outside a movie theater. The informant gave detailed descriptions and the license plate number. Police dispatched and found a matching car two blocks away. They approached and saw one man matching the description. Then, the police opened the car doors, pried open a locked tool case in the rear, found an envelope with a gram of cocaine, arrested the driver, then opened the glove compartment and found marijuana. The driver is charged with two counts of possession. He's moving to exclude both substances as evidence.

The question is whether his motion will be granted or denied. The options are about whether the evidence (cocaine and/or marijuana) should be excluded.

I remember that for a search to be legal under the Fourth Amendment, the police need either a warrant or an exception to the warrant requirement. One of the exceptions is probable cause combined with exigent circumstances, which allows a warrantless search. Another is the automobile exception, which says that if there's probable cause to search a vehicle, the police can do so without a warrant because vehicles are mobile and easily moved.

So, the key here is whether the police had probable cause when they approached the car. The informant was reliable, which means his information is credible. They found a car matching the description, in the vicinity, and one man matching the description. That seems like probable cause to search the vehicle because there's a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime would be found.

When the police opened the doors and searched the tool case, they found cocaine. Since the search was valid under the automobile exception, the cocaine would be admissible. After arresting the driver, they then searched the glove compartment and found marijuana. Wait, does the arrest change things? When a police officer makes a lawful arrest, they can conduct a search incident to arrest. But that usually applies to the person and the area within their immediate control. However, for vehicles, the search incident to arrest might allow searching the entire passenger compartment, but I'm not sure if it extends beyond that, especially after the initial search.

Wait, but the initial search was based on probable cause, so when they found the cocaine, that led to the arrest. Then, after arresting, they searched the glove compartment. Alternatively, perhaps the initial search (finding the tool case) was part of the probable cause search under the automobile exception, so the glove compartment would be within the scope of that search. Or maybe they didn't need to rely on the arrest for that part.

Another angle: when the police have probable cause to search the entire vehicle, they can search all areas that might contain the evidence. So if they had probable cause to believe the car contained drugs, they can search the entire car, including the glove compartment and the tool case, without needing a warrant. 

So, in this case, the initial search leading to the cocaine would be allowed because of the automobile exception. Then, after finding the cocaine and arresting the driver, searching the glove compartment would still be part of the same valid search under probable cause. Alternatively, the arrest would allow a search of the person and the area within reach, but the glove compartment might be considered part of the vehicle that's already under a valid search.

Wait, but the police opened the glove compartment after arresting the driver. So maybe the arrest gives them the right to search the entire vehicle again, but I think the initial search was already sufficient. So both the cocaine and marijuana would be admissible because the police had probable cause to search the vehicle, and both searches (tool case and glove compartment) were part of that.

Alternatively, could the search of the glove compartment after arrest be considered a separate issue? I'm a bit confused about the timing. They found the cocaine, arrested the driver, and then found the marijuana. But since the initial search was lawful, perhaps the entire vehicle was within the scope of the search, including the glove compartment. So both substances would be admissible.

Looking at the options:

Option E says the motion is denied as to both. Option F says denied because police had probable cause. Option A is granted for cocaine only. Option I granted for marijuana only.

Wait, but maybe the search of the glove compartment after arrest could be an issue. When making an arrest, the police can search the arrestee and the area within their immediate control. But the glove compartment might be considered part of the vehicle, which is a separate issue from the arrest. So perhaps the initial search of the tool case was valid, but the glove compartment after the arrest might require a different justification.

Alternatively, since the police had probable cause to search the entire vehicle, the glove compartment would be included in that search. So both drugs would be admissible. Therefore, the motion to suppress both would be denied. So the answer would be E: denied as to both.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is "denied, as to the cocaine and the marijuana." Option F is "denied, because the police had probable cause to search the vehicle." So either E or F would make sense.

But the question is about the motion to exclude. If the police had probable cause, then the searches are valid under the automobile exception. So the correct answer would be E, but I'm not sure if F is better because it's more about the reasoning.

Wait, but the options are phrased as which outcome is correct, not the reasoning. So if the motion is denied, the answer would be E or F, depending on why. But the options are that the motion is denied or granted, and the reasoning is part of the option.

Wait, looking again:

Option E: denied, as to the cocaine and the marijuana.

Option F: denied, because the police had probable cause to search the vehicle.

So the difference is that E is a statement about both being denied, while F gives the reason. But in the options, each option is a possible outcome. So the correct answer would be that the motion is denied as to both, so E.

Wait, but maybe the initial search of the tool case was okay, but the glove compartment after arrest was an unlawful expansion. But no, because the police had probable cause to search the entire vehicle when they approached it. So the glove compartment was part of that.

So the motion should be denied as to both, which is option E.

The question revolves around whether the police had the legal authority to search the vehicle and seize the evidence (cocaine and marijuana) without a warrant. The key legal principles at play are the automobile exception to the warrant requirement and the concept of probable cause.

The police acted on a tip from a reliable informant, which provided detailed descriptions of the vehicle and the individuals involved. When they located the vehicle matching the description and found a man fitting the informant's description, they had probable cause to search the vehicle under the automobile exception. This exception allows warrantless searches of vehicles if there is probable cause to believe the vehicle contains evidence of a crime.

The police searched the vehicle, found cocaine in a locked tool case, and then found marijuana in the glove compartment after arresting the driver. Both searches were part of the same continuous search of the vehicle, which was justified by probable cause. The automobile exception applies to the entire vehicle, including the glove compartment, and the search was lawful.

Given that the police had probable cause to search the vehicle and the search was conducted lawfully under the automobile exception, the evidence (cocaine and marijuana) would be admissible. Therefore, the defendant's motion to exclude both substances from evidence would most likely be denied.

The correct answer is:

**E: denied, as to the cocaine and the marijuana.**
