Okay, so I have this problem about alpha-helices and hair growth. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step.

First, I read that a turn of an alpha-helix has 3.6 residues. Each turn is 5.41 Ångströms long when measured along the helix axis. Then, the hair grows 6 inches per year, and I need to find out how many amino acid residues are added per second to each alpha-helix in the keratin fiber.

Wait, wait. So I think I need to find the rate of residue addition in terms of per second. Let me jot down the given data:

- Residues per turn (n) = 3.6
- Length per turn = 5.41 Å
- Hair growth rate = 6 inches per year

I guess the idea is that the growth in length of the hair corresponds to the addition of residues along the helix. So, for every certain length added, a certain number of residues are added.

First, I should convert all the units to compatible ones. Let's think about the units. I'm dealing with inches per year and need to get to residues per second. That's a big conversion.

Let me start by converting the hair growth rate into Ångströms per second. Because 1 turn is 5.41 Å, and each turn has 3.6 residues. So if I find out how many turns are added per second, I can multiply by residues per turn to get the rate.

So step 1: Convert 6 inches/year to Å/sec.

Wait, how do I do that? Let's see.

I know that 1 inch is 2.54 cm. So 6 inches is 6 * 2.54 cm = 15.24 cm. And 1 meter is 100 cm, so 15.24 cm is 0.1524 meters.

Wait, but I need to convert this to angstroms. 1 meter is 1e10 Å (since 1 Å is 1e-10 meters). So 0.1524 meters is 0.1524e10 Å = 1.524e9 Å. Wait, no, wait: 1 m = 1e10 Å. So 0.1524 m is 0.1524 * 1e10 = 1.524e9 Å.

Wait no, wait another way. 1 m = 1e10 Å, so 1 cm is 1e8 Å (because 1 m = 100 cm, so 1 cm is 1e10 / 100 = 1e8 Å). So 15.24 cm is 15.24 * 1e8 = 1.524e9 Å. Right.

So the hair grows 1.524e9 Å per year.

But wait, that's the total growth in a year, so the rate is 1.524e9 Å/year.

Now, I need to find out how many Ångströms per second that is. So divide by the number of seconds in a year.

A year has 365 days. Each day has 24 hours, each hour 60 minutes, each minute 60 seconds.

So seconds per year: 365 * 24 * 60 * 60.

Let me compute that. 365 *24 is 8760 hours. 8760 *60 is 525600 minutes. 525600 *60 is 31,536,000 seconds. So approximately 3.1536e7 seconds.

So the growth rate is 1.524e9 Å/year divided by 3.1536e7 seconds/year = (1.524e9)/(3.1536e7) = approx (1.524 / 3.1536) * 1e2.

Let me compute 1.524 / 3.1536. Hmm, 3.1536 is about 3.154. Let me approximate 1.524 /3.154.

3.154 goes into 1.524 about 0.483 times. So approximately 0.483 * 100 = 48.3 Å/sec.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

1.524e9 / 3.1536e7 = (1.524 / 3.1536) * 1e2.

Compute 1.524 /3.1536:

3.1536 * 0.483 = let's see: 3 *0.483=1.449, 0.1536*0.483≈0.0742. So total about 1.449 +0.0742=1.5232. Oh, wait, that's almost exactly 1.524. So 0.483.

So 0.483 * 100 = 48.3 Å per second.

So the hair grows at about 48.3 Å per second.

Now, each turn of the helix is 5.41 Å in length. So each turn contributes 3.6 residues. So the number of turns added per second would be the growth rate divided by the length per turn.

Turns per second = 48.3 Å/sec / 5.41 Å/turn ≈ ?

Let me calculate that. 48.3 /5.41 ≈ let's see:

5.41 * 8 = 43.28

5.41 * 9=48.69

Wait, 5.41*8=43.28. 48.3-43.28=5.02 left.

5.02 /5.41 ≈ approximately 0.927. So total is 8.927 turns per second.

So about 8.927 turns per second.

Each turn has 3.6 residues, so residues per second is 8.927 * 3.6.

Let me compute that. 8 *3.6 is 28.8, 0.927 *3.6 is about 3.337. So total is approximately 28.8 +3.337 = 32.137 residues per second.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me calculate 8.927 *3.6 accurately.

8 *3.6 =28.8

0.927 *3.6: Let's compute:

0.9 *3.6 =3.24

0.027 *3.6=0.0972

So 3.24 +0.0972=3.3372

So total is 28.8 +3.3372=32.1372 residues per second.

Looking at the options, option I is 32 res/sec. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check all the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, the conversion of hair growth rate:

6 inches/year. 1 inch = 2.54 cm, so 6 inches =15.24 cm. To meters, that's 0.1524 m. Then to angstroms: 0.1524 m = 0.1524e10 Å = 1.524e9 Å/year.

Yes, that's correct.

Seconds in a year: 365 *24 *60 *60 =31,536,000 s ≈3.1536e7 s. Correct.

Divide 1.524e9 by 3.1536e7: (1.524/3.1536)*1e2 = approx 0.483 *1e2 =48.3 Å/s. Correct.

Then, each turn is 5.41 Å, so 48.3 /5.41 =approx 8.927 turns per second.

Multiply by 3.6 residues per turn: 8.927 *3.6 ≈32.137 res/sec.

Looking at the options, option I is 32 res/sec.

Wait, but I thought the options were A to J, so I:32.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Because the alpha helix's length per turn is 5.41 Å along the axis. So when the hair grows, each residue adds a certain length along the axis. So perhaps the growth rate in Å per second can be directly converted into residues per second.

Wait, the length per residue along the axis. Since each turn is 3.6 residues and 5.41 Å, the length per residue is 5.41 /3.6 ≈1.503 Å/residue.

So the growth rate is 48.3 Å/sec. So residues per second would be 48.3 /1.503 ≈32.13 res/sec.

Which is the same as before. So 32 res/sec is the correct answer, which is option I.

But wait, let me check the options again to be sure.

Looking back, the options are:

A:42

B:36

C:26

D:28

E:24

F:38

G:40

H:30

I:32

J:34

Yes, option I is 32. So the correct answer is I.

To determine how many amino acid residues must be added to each α-helix in the keratin fiber per second, we start by analyzing the given data:

1. **Residues per turn of the α-helix**: 3.6  
2. **Length per turn of the α-helix**: 5.41 Å  
3. **Hair growth rate**: 6 inches per year  

### Step 1: Convert hair growth rate to Ångströms per second  
- Convert 6 inches to meters:  
  \( 6 \, \text{inches} \times 2.54 \, \text{cm/inch} = 15.24 \, \text{cm} = 0.1524 \, \text{m} \).  
- Convert meters to Ångströms:  
  \( 1 \, \text{m} = 10^{10} \, \text{Å}, \, \text{so } 0.1524 \, \text{m} = 0.1524 \times 10^{10} \, \text{Å} = 1.524 \times 10^9 \, \text{Å} \).  
- Convert annual growth to seconds:  
  \( 1 \, \text{year} = 365 \times 24 \times 60 \times 60 = 31,536,000 \, \text{seconds} = 3.1536 \times 10^7 \, \text{seconds} \).  
- Growth rate in Ångströms per second:  
  \[
  \frac{1.524 \times 10^9 \, \text{Å}}{3.1536 \times 10^7 \, \text{s}} \approx 48.3 \, \text{Å/s}.
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate residues per second  
- Each turn of the α-helix corresponds to 3.6 residues and is 5.41 Å long.  
- The length per residue is:  
  \[
  \frac{5.41 \, \text{Å}}{3.6 \, \text{residues}} \approx 1.503 \, \text{Å/residue}.
  \]  
- The number of residues added per second is:  
  \[
  \frac{48.3 \, \text{Å/s}}{1.503 \, \text{Å/residue}} \approx 32.14 \, \text{residues/second}.
  \]

### Final Answer  
The closest option to the calculated value is **32 residues/second**, which corresponds to **option I**.
