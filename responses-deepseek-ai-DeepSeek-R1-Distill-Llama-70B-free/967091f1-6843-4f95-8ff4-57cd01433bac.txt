Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here about college freshmen's grade point averages. Hmm, let's see. The question says that 300 freshmen have GPAs that are approximately normally distributed. The mean is 2.1, and the standard deviation is 1.2. They want to know how many would have GPAs between 2.5 and 3.5, considering the averages are recorded to the nearest tenth.

Wait, wait. So the GPAs are being recorded to the nearest tenth, which means they come in steps like 2.5, 2.6, etc. But when calculating probabilities, I think we usually consider the continuous scale. So, for example, a GPA of 2.5 would include anything from 2.45 to 2.55, right? Because anything below 2.45 would round down to 2.4, and 2.55 would round up to 2.6. Oh wait, no, wait. If you're rounding to the nearest tenth, the cutoffs are at the midpoints between tenths. So 2.5 is the midpoint between 2.45 and 2.55. So, to include all GPAs that would round to 2.5, you'd look at 2.45 to 2.55. Similarly, 3.5 would include 3.45 to 3.55.

Wait, but the problem is asking for GPAs between 2.5 and 3.5. So I think that means they want all GPAs that are 2.5, 2.6, ..., up to 3.5. So in terms of actual values before rounding, each tenth represents a range. So for 2.5, the range is 2.45 to 2.55; for 3.5, it's 3.45 to 3.55. So the overall range we're interested in is from 2.45 to 3.55.

So the problem becomes finding the number of students with GPAs between 2.45 and 3.55. Since the GPAs are normally distributed, I can use the Z-score method. 

First, I need to calculate the Z-scores for 2.45 and 3.55. The formula for Z is (X - μ) / σ. 

So for X = 2.45:
Z1 = (2.45 - 2.1) / 1.2 = (0.35) / 1.2 ≈ 0.2917.

For X = 3.55:
Z2 = (3.55 - 2.1) / 1.2 = (1.45) / 1.2 ≈ 1.2083.

Now, I need to find the area under the standard normal curve between Z1=0.2917 and Z2=1.2083. That is, the probability that a student's GPA is in this range.

I remember that the standard normal table gives the cumulative probability up to a given Z. So the area between Z1 and Z2 is P(Z < Z2) - P(Z < Z1).

Looking up Z1=0.29. The standard normal table says for Z=0.29, the cumulative probability is about 0.6141. Wait, wait, let me check. Oh, wait, no, I think I should use more precise values. Let me see, a Z of 0.29 is 0.29. From the table, Z=0.29 corresponds to 0.6141, right? And Z=1.21: let me check that. Z=1.21 is about 0.8869.

So the area between 0.2917 and 1.2083 is 0.8869 - 0.6141 = 0.2728. Hmm, wait, 0.8869 minus 0.6141 is 0.2728, so about 27.28% of the students fall into this range.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate using more precise Z values. Because 0.2917 is approximately 0.29, but maybe I can get more accurate by using linear interpolation.

Wait, for Z1=0.2917. The Z-table for 0.29 is 0.6141, and for 0.30 it's 0.6179. The difference between 0.29 and 0.30 is 0.0038. Since 0.2917 is 0.0017 above 0.29, the fraction is 0.0017/0.01 = 0.17. So the cumulative probability would be 0.6141 + 0.17*(0.0038) ≈ 0.6141 + 0.000646 ≈ 0.6147.

Similarly for Z2=1.2083. Let's see, Z=1.20 is 0.8849, and Z=1.21 is 0.8869. So the difference is 0.002 per 0.01 Z. 1.2083 is 0.0083 above 1.20, so 0.83 of the way from 1.20 to 1.21. So the cumulative probability is 0.8849 + 0.83*(0.002) ≈ 0.8849 + 0.00166 ≈ 0.88656.

So the area between Z1 and Z2 is 0.88656 - 0.6147 = 0.27186, approximately 0.2719 or 27.19%.

So the expected number of students is 300 * 0.2719 ≈ 81.57, which is about 82 students.

Looking at the options, option E is 82 students. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but wait another thought. Oh wait, the initial calculation with Z1=0.29 and Z2=1.21 gave me 0.8869 - 0.6141 = 0.2728, which is 27.28%, leading to 81.84, which rounds to 82. So that's consistent.

Alternatively, if I use exact Z-values, perhaps using more precise methods. But in any case, the closest option is 82, which is E.

To determine how many of the 300 freshmen have grade point averages (GPAs) between 2.5 and 3.5, we first account for the fact that GPAs are recorded to the nearest tenth. This means a GPA of 2.5 includes values from 2.45 to 2.55, and a GPA of 3.5 includes values from 3.45 to 3.55. Therefore, the range of interest is 2.45 to 3.55.

Given that the GPAs are normally distributed with a mean (μ) of 2.1 and a standard deviation (σ) of 1.2, we calculate the Z-scores for the boundaries of this range:

1. For \( X = 2.45 \):
   \[
   Z_1 = \frac{2.45 - 2.1}{1.2} = \frac{0.35}{1.2} \approx 0.2917
   \]

2. For \( X = 3.55 \):
   \[
   Z_2 = \frac{3.55 - 2.1}{1.2} = \frac{1.45}{1.2} \approx 1.2083
   \]

Using the standard normal distribution table, we find the cumulative probabilities corresponding to these Z-scores:

- For \( Z_1 = 0.2917 \), the cumulative probability is approximately \( P(Z < 0.2917) \approx 0.6147 \).
- For \( Z_2 = 1.2083 \), the cumulative probability is approximately \( P(Z < 1.2083) \approx 0.8866 \).

The probability that a student's GPA falls between 2.45 and 3.55 is the difference between these cumulative probabilities:
\[
P(2.45 \leq X \leq 3.55) = P(Z < 1.2083) - P(Z < 0.2917) \approx 0.8866 - 0.6147 = 0.2719
\]

This means about 27.19% of the freshmen are expected to have GPAs in this range. Since there are 300 freshmen, the expected number of students is:
\[
0.2719 \times 300 \approx 81.57 \approx 82
\]

Thus, the expected number of freshmen with GPAs between 2.5 and 3.5 is approximately **82 students**.

The correct answer is **E: 82 students**.
