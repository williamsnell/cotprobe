Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the change in entropy when heating solid silver. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on thermodynamics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives the heat capacity equation for silver as C_p = -0.023T + 2.5e-3 T^2 - 1.9e-5 T^3. The temperature range is from 273°C to 333°C. Oh wait, wait, wait. Oh, but wait, in Kelvin and Celsius, the size is the same, right? So 273°C is 546 K? Wait no, no, 273 K is 0°C. Wait, I'm getting confused. Wait, the problem says 273 ≤ T ≤ 333°C, which would be 546 K to 606 K, but I think the formula is given in terms of Celsius because it's written as T without the K. Wait no, no, wait, in thermodynamics, when integrating with respect to T in Kelvin or Celsius doesn't matter for the integral because the change is the same. But wait, no, because the derivative of T in K and C is different. Oh wait, wait, no, because T in the equation is in Kelvin? Or Celsius? That's confusing.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The problem states that the expression is valid for 273 ≤ T ≤ 333°C. So T here is in Celsius. But when calculating entropy, which is an integral involving dT, it's usually in Kelvin because entropy equations use absolute temperature. Oh wait, but if the formula for C_p is given in terms of Celsius, but when calculating the entropy, we need to use the correct temperature in Kelvin. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing something up. Let me think.

Entropy change ΔS is calculated by integrating (C_p / T) dT from initial temperature T1 to final T2. But wait, the C_p given here is in cal/(mol·°C) or cal/(mol·K). Oh, wait, because when you're using the formula in terms of T, which is in Celsius here, but for the entropy calculation, the integral should be with respect to T in Kelvin? Or perhaps I should convert the Celsius to Kelvin in the integral.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let's clarify. The formula for C_p is given in terms of T in Celsius, but when calculating entropy, the integral is with respect to T in Kelvin, because entropy equations use absolute temperature. So perhaps I need to adjust the integral.

Alternatively, maybe I can just proceed as if T is in Kelvin because the change in T (ΔT) would be the same in Kelvin and Celsius. But wait, when integrating C_p/T dT, it's the absolute temperature that matters because T is in denominator. So if the given T is in Celsius, but I'm integrating with it as if it's Kelvin, that would cause a problem. So I think I should convert T from Celsius to Kelvin in the integral.

Wait, but maybe I can proceed without converting. Because in the equation, T is given in Celsius, so perhaps the integration should consider the T as in Kelvin. Let me think: if the formula is in Celsius, but when using it in the entropy equation, the T is actually in Kelvin. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Maybe I should just proceed with T in Kelvin, so the initial T is 273 + 273.15? Wait, no, wait, 273°C is way beyond the boiling point of water. Wait, wait, no, 0°C is 273.15 K. So 273°C is 546.15 K, and 333°C is 606.15 K. So the integral should be from T_initial = 546.15 K to T_final = 606.15 K.

But wait, the C_p equation is given in terms of T in Celsius. So substituting T in Celsius into the equation gives C_p in cal/(mol·°C). But when I use it in the entropy equation, which is ∫(C_p / T) dT from T1 to T2, where T is in Kelvin. So perhaps I need to express C_p in terms of Kelvin.

Wait, but if T is in Celsius, how does that affect the integral? Let me think. Let's consider that when T_c is the temperature in Celsius, then T_k = T_c + 273.15. So when I write C_p(T_c) as a function of Celsius, but in the integral, I have to express everything in terms of T_k.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the integral in terms of T_c. Because dT_k = dT_c, since a change of 1°C is a change of 1 K. So the limits of integration from 273°C to 333°C would correspond to T_k from 546 K to 606 K.

But the C_p is given as a function of T in Celsius. So in the integral, when I compute ∫(C_p / T_k) dT_c, but since dT_k = dT_c, I can write the integral as ∫(C_p(T_c) / (T_c + 273.15)) dT_c from 273 to 333.

Hmm, that sounds correct but might complicate the integration because the denominator becomes T_c + 273.15. Alternatively, perhaps I can approximate that 273 is much smaller than T_c, but wait, no, because T_c is 273 to 333, so adding 273 would make it 546 to 606 K. So it's not negligible.

This seems a bit involved, but maybe I can proceed by substituting T_k = T_c + 273.15, and then express T_c as T_k - 273.15, and substitute into the C_p equation.

Wait, but maybe there's a simpler approach. Let me think: the entropy change is the integral from T1 to T2 of (C_p / T) dT. But since C_p is given as a function of T in Celsius, perhaps I can just proceed with the integral in Celsius, but using T in Kelvin in the denominator.

Wait, but would that be correct? Because T in the denominator needs to be in Kelvin. So when T is in Celsius, I have to convert it to Kelvin. That might complicate the integral. Alternatively, perhaps I can express T in the denominator as (T_c + 273.15), where T_c is the variable of integration.

So the integral becomes ∫ [ (-0.023 T_c + 2.5e-3 T_c^2 -1.9e-5 T_c^3 ) / (T_c + 273.15) ] dT_c from T_c =273 to 333.

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution to simplify it, but that might be too time-consuming for a problem like this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Maybe the given C_p is actually in terms of T in Kelvin, but the problem states T is in Celsius. Wait, no, the problem says the expression is valid for T between 273 and 333°C. So T is in Celsius. So in the equation, T is in Celsius. So when using the C_p equation, T is in Celsius.

But in the entropy equation, the integral is with respect to T in Kelvin. So perhaps I should change variables. Let me try to re-express the integral.

So, let me denote T_c as the temperature in Celsius, and T_k = T_c + 273.15.

So the entropy change is ∫ (C_p / T_k) dT_c from T_c =273 to 333.

Wait, but dT_c is the same as dT_k, so the integral can be written as:

ΔS = ∫ (from T_c=273 to 333) [ C_p(T_c) / (T_c + 273.15) ] dT_c.

Hmm, this is correct but might be difficult to integrate analytically. Let me see what C_p(T_c) is.

C_p(T_c) = -0.023 T_c + 2.5e-3 T_c^2 - 1.9e-5 T_c^3.

So substituting this into the integral:

ΔS = ∫ [ (-0.023 T_c + 0.0025 T_c^2 - 0.000019 T_c^3 ) / (T_c + 273.15) ] dT_c from 273 to 333.

Hmm, integrating this expression might be a bit challenging. Maybe I can break it down into separate terms.

Let's split the numerator:

ΔS = ∫ [ (-0.023 T_c) / (T_c + 273.15) + (0.0025 T_c^2) / (T_c + 273.15) - (0.000019 T_c^3) / (T_c + 273.15) ) ] dT_c.

So each term can be considered separately.

Let me consider each integral:

I1 = ∫ (-0.023 T_c) / (T_c + 273.15) dT_c,

I2 = ∫ 0.0025 T_c^2 / (T_c + 273.15) dT_c,

I3 = ∫ -0.000019 T_c^3 / (T_c + 273.15) dT_c.

So, the overall ΔS = I1 + I2 + I3.

Hmm, integrating each term. Let me think about substitution.

Let me let u = T_c + 273.15, so du = dT_c.

Then, T_c = u - 273.15.

Substituting into each integral.

Let's start with I1:

I1 = ∫ (-0.023 (u - 273.15)) / u du.

= -0.023 ∫ (u - 273.15)/u du

= -0.023 ∫ [1 - 273.15/u ] du

= -0.023 [ ∫ du - 273.15 ∫ (1/u) du ]

= -0.023 [ u - 273.15 ln u ] + C.

Now, substituting back u = T_c + 273.15,

I1 = -0.023 [ (T_c + 273.15) - 273.15 ln(T_c + 273.15) ) ] evaluated from 273 to 333.

Similarly for I2 and I3, but this is getting complicated. Let me think if there's a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can approximate the denominator T_k = T_c + 273.15 ≈ 273.15 + 273 = 546.15 at T_c=273, but up to 333°C, which is 606.15 K. So the denominator varies from about 546 to 606. But maybe for simplification, I can factor out 273.15.

Alternatively, perhaps I can expand each term using polynomial division.

Wait, for example, for I1: (T_c) / (T_c + 273.15) = 1 - 273.15/(T_c + 273.15).

So that's what I did earlier. So perhaps integrating term by term is manageable.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use substitution for each integral.

Wait, let me try I2.

I2 = ∫ 0.0025 T_c^2 / (T_c + 273.15) dT_c.

Let me perform polynomial division on T_c^2 / (T_c + a), where a=273.15.

Dividing T_c^2 by (T_c + a):

T_c^2 ÷ (T_c + a) = T_c - a + a^2/(T_c + a).

Wait, let me check:

(T_c + a)(T_c - a) = T_c^2 - a^2.

Hmm, perhaps that's not the way. Alternatively, let me write T_c^2 = (T_c + a)(T_c - a) + a^2.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to write T_c^2 = (T_c + a)(T_c) - a T_c.

Wait, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps write T_c^2 = (T_c + a)(T_c - a) + a^2.

Wait, let me compute (T_c + a)(T_c - a) = T_c^2 - a^2. So T_c^2 = (T_c + a)(T_c - a) + a^2.

So, T_c^2/(T_c + a) = (T_c - a) + a^2/(T_c + a).

So, I2 becomes ∫ 0.0025 [ (T_c - a) + a²/(T_c + a) ] dT_c.

Which is 0.0025 [ ∫ (T_c - a) dT_c + a² ∫ 1/(T_c + a) dT_c ].

Integrating term by term:

∫ (T_c - a) dT_c = (1/2) T_c^2 - a T_c.

∫ 1/(T_c + a) dT_c = ln(T_c + a).

So I2 becomes:

0.0025 [ (1/2 T_c^2 - a T_c) + a² ln(T_c + a) ) ] evaluated from 273 to 333.

Similarly for I3, which is more complicated.

I3 = ∫ (-0.000019) T_c^3 / (T_c + a) dT_c.

Hmm, perhaps using polynomial division for T_c^3 / (T_c + a):

T_c^3 = (T_c + a)(T_c^2 - a T_c + a^2) - a^3.

Wait, let me check: (T_c + a)(T_c^2 - a T_c + a^2) = T_c^3 -a T_c^2 + a^2 T_c + a T_c^2 - a^2 T_c + a^3 = T_c^3 + 0 T_c^2 + 0 T_c + a^3.

So, T_c^3 = (T_c + a)(T_c^2 - a T_c + a^2) - a^3.

Thus, T_c^3 / (T_c + a) = T_c^2 - a T_c + a^2 - a^3 / (T_c + a).

So, I3 becomes:

∫ (-0.000019) [ T_c^2 - a T_c + a^2 - a^3/(T_c + a) ] dT_c.

Which is:

-0.000019 ∫ [ T_c^2 - a T_c + a^2 - a^3/(T_c + a) ] dT_c.

Each term can be integrated separately:

∫ T_c^2 dT_c = (1/3) T_c^3,

∫ (-a T_c) dT_c = - (a/2) T_c^2,

∫ a^2 dT_c = a^2 T_c,

∫ (-a^3)/(T_c + a) dT_c = -a^3 ln(T_c + a).

Putting it all together:

I3 = -0.000019 [ (1/3 T_c^3) - (a/2) T_c^2 + a^2 T_c - a^3 ln(T_c + a) ) ] evaluated from 273 to 333.

This is getting really involved, but perhaps I can proceed.

So, now, I have expressions for I1, I2, I3 in terms of T_c evaluated at 273 and 333.

Let me compute each term step by step.

First, let's compute I1:

I1 = -0.023 [ (T_c + 273.15) - 273.15 ln(T_c + 273.15) ) ] evaluated from 273 to 333.

At T_c = 333:

Term1_333 = (333 + 273.15) - 273.15 ln(333 + 273.15)
= 606.15 - 273.15 ln(606.15)

At T_c =273:

Term1_273 = (273 + 273.15) - 273.15 ln(273 + 273.15)
= 546.15 - 273.15 ln(546.15)

So, I1 = -0.023 [ (Term1_333) - (Term1_273) ]
= -0.023 [ (606.15 - 273.15 ln(606.15) ) - (546.15 - 273.15 ln(546.15)) ) ]
= -0.023 [ 606.15 -546.15 - 273.15 (ln(606.15) - ln(546.15)) ]
= -0.023 [ 60 - 273.15 ln(606.15/546.15) ]
= -0.023 [ 60 - 273.15 ln(1.1122) ]

Compute ln(1.1122) ≈ 0.105.

So,

I1 ≈ -0.023 [ 60 - 273.15 * 0.105 ]
= -0.023 [ 60 - 28.681 ]
= -0.023 [ 31.319 ]
≈ -0.023 * 31.319 ≈ -0.719.

Wait, but this is just I1. Now moving on to I2.

I2 = 0.0025 [ (1/2 T_c^2 - a T_c) + a^2 ln(T_c + a) ) ] from 273 to 333, where a=273.15.

Compute each part:

At T_c=333:

Term2_333 = (1/2 * 333^2) - (273.15 * 333) + (273.15^2) * ln(606.15)

At T_c=273:

Term2_273 = (1/2 *273^2) - (273.15 * 273) + (273.15^2) * ln(546.15)

So I2 = 0.0025 [ (Term2_333 - Term2_273) ]

Let me compute each term.

First, compute (1/2 T_c^2) at 333 and 273:

At 333: 0.5 * 333^2 = 0.5 * 110889 = 55444.5

At 273: 0.5 * 273^2 = 0.5 * 74529 = 37264.5

Next, (a T_c) at 333 and 273:

a=273.15.

At 333: 273.15 * 333 = let me compute 273 * 333 = approx 273*300=81900, 273*33=9009 → total 90909, but
