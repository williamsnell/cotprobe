Okay, let's see. I've got this multiple-choice question about Shapiro's claims regarding surveys and longitudinal studies on illegal drug use. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct answer from options A to J.

So, the question is asking what Shapiro's surveys, confirmed by longitudinal studies, indicate about illegal drug use. I remember from my psychology classes that longitudinal studies track the same people over time, so they can show patterns or changes as individuals age.

Let me think about the options. Option A says the use is usually a temporary phase in adolescence. That sounds familiar. I think I've heard that most people try drugs when they're young, like in their teens or early twenties, and then stop as they get older. Like, they might experiment in high school or college but then settle down into careers and families, so they quit.

Option B suggests most experiment but don't continue. That's similar to A but broader. It's saying that even beyond adolescence, people try drugs but don't keep using them. But I think the key here is that it's a phase during adolescence, not necessarily that most people try but don't continue. Because I think the majority don't even try illegal drugs.

Option C talks about excessive use of legal drugs being the norm. That doesn't seem right. Legal drugs like alcohol and tobacco do have high usage, but the question is about illegal drugs, so I don't think this is the answer.

Option D says illegal drug use inevitably diminishes over time. That sounds too absolute. While many people do stop, I don't think it's inevitable for everyone. Some might continue, but perhaps not as heavily.

Option E states that those who begin using illegal drugs typically stop before addiction sets in. That makes sense because not everyone who tries drugs becomes addicted. So if they use occasionally, they might quit before getting hooked. But I'm a bit confused between E and A.

Option F claims the studies show no consistent patterns. That can't be right because the question says the surveys have been confirmed by longitudinal studies, implying there are clear patterns.

Option G suggests users transition to legal substances over time. I'm not sure about that. Maybe some do, but I don't think that's a common pattern. It might be the other way around, or people just stop using both.

Option H says moderate use is the norm. I don't think so. Most people don't use illegal drugs at all. So moderate use wouldn't be the norm.

Option I claims those who begin using don't stop until they're addicted. That seems the opposite of what I thought earlier. It would mean that once you start, you continue until addiction, which doesn't fit with the idea that many people try drugs and then stop.

Option J says excessive use is the norm, which doesn't make sense because most people don't use illegal drugs excessively. It's more that a small number might, but not the majority.

So, narrowing it down, Shapiro's point is probably about drug use being a temporary phase. So between A and E. I think A is about the phase in adolescence, while E is about stopping before addiction. Which is more likely the correct answer?

From what I remember, the gateway theory suggests that people might try drugs in adolescence and then stop. So longitudinal studies would support that it's a temporary phase. Also, the question says "indicate that," and A directly refers to a temporary phase in adolescence, which fits with a common finding in developmental psychology.

I think the correct answer is A.

The correct answer is A. Longitudinal studies support the idea that illegal drug use is often a temporary phase during adolescence, with many individuals ceasing use as they mature.

Answer: A
