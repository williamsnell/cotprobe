Okay, so I've got this question about Taurek's claims, and I need to figure out which option is correct. I'm a bit rusty on my philosophy, but I'll try to think it through.

Taurek is known for his work in ethics, specifically in the area of moral decision-making when it comes to saving lives. I remember that he presented a paper called "Should the Numbers Count?" where he argued against the utilitarian approach of saving the greatest number of people. So he's against the idea that saving more lives is always better.

Let me look at the options:

Option A says the death of two is always worse than one. That sounds like a utilitarian view, where greater numbers matter. But Taurek was against that, so he probably wouldn't say this. So A might not be correct.

Option B claims that the death of two is sometimes less bad than one. That doesn't immediately ring a bell. Wait, Taurek's argument was about whether numbers should count, not necessarily about the comparative badness in different scenarios. Maybe it's not about whether one or two deaths are worse, but more about the moral weight.

Option C states the death of two is exactly as bad as one. That seems too absolute. I don't think Taurek would say that. It might be a misrepresentation of his view.

Option D says the notion of summing two people’s losses should be rejected. That sounds familiar. Taurek argued against aggregating or summing individual losses. He believed that each person's loss should be considered separately, and you can't just add them up to decide what's morally better. So he rejects the idea of the sum, which is more of a utilitarian approach.

Wait, let me make sure. In his argument, Taurek uses an example where you have a choice between saving one person or saving five. He says that each person's life is valuable, but you can't just say five is more valuable than one. Instead, each person has an equal claim, so it's like a numbers game but not in a way that more is automatically better. He's more in favor of equal consideration rather than aggregation.

So the key point is that he doesn't think we should sum the losses. Hence, option D is correct because it reflects his rejection of summing or aggregating the losses of multiple individuals. The other options don't capture his stance accurately. Option B might be tricky, but I think it's more about the aggregation than the comparative badness in varying circumstances.

Taurek's argument, as presented in his work "Should the Numbers Count?", challenges the utilitarian perspective that saving more lives is inherently better. He rejects the idea of aggregating or summing individual losses, arguing instead for equal consideration of each person's life. This means he does not support the notion that the moral value of saving lives can be determined by simply adding up the number of people affected. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** reflects a utilitarian view, which Taurek opposes, so it is incorrect.
- **Option B** suggests that the death of two people could sometimes be less bad than one, but this does not align with Taurek's focus on rejecting aggregation rather than comparing the badness of outcomes.
- **Option C** is too absolute and does not represent Taurek's nuanced position.
- **Option D** correctly captures Taurek's rejection of summing individual losses, making it the accurate choice.

Answer: D
