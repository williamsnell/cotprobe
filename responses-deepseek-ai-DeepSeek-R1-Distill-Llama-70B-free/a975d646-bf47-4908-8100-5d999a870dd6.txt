Question:

A woman owned an extensive art collection that she displayed in a special room of her home. While the woman was away on a vacation, there was a burglary at her home, and her favorite painting was stolen. Although the painting was insured for $1,000,000 by an insurance company, it had a market value of over $1,500,000. When the woman returned from vacation, she met with a detective employed by the insurance company to investigate the theft. During their meeting, the woman told the detective that she would pay him an extra $50,000 if he recovered the paihting. For the next three weeks, the detective investigated the theft as part of his job responsibilities with the insurance company. Within the course of this investigation, the detective learned who was responsible for the burglary. As a consequence, the culprit was apprehended, and the painting was recovered and returned to the woman. The detective then requested the $50,000 that the woman had promised to pay him. After the woman refused to make the payment, the detective sued the woman for breach of contract. Who is most likely to prevail?

Options:

A: The detective, because the market value of the painting exceeded its insured value, so there was sufficient consideration to support the woman's promise.
B: The woman, because her promise was gratuitous.
C: The woman, because the detective was already paid by the insurance company for his investigative services.
D: The detective, because he went above and beyond his job duties to recover the painting.
E: The woman, because she did not put the promise of extra payment in writing.
F: The woman, because the insurance company owed her a pre-existing duty to find the painting.
G: The detective, because the woman's promise was a valid verbal contract.
H: The detective, because he did the act necessary to constitute an acceptance of the woman's offer.
I: The detective, because the woman's promise constituted a binding contract.
J: The woman, because the detective was performing his job, for which he was already compensated.

Okay, so I've got this question about contract law, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully again.

So, there's a woman whose painting was stolen. The painting was insured for $1 million, but it's actually worth over $1.5 million. She offered the detective an extra $50k if he recovered the painting. The detective is employed by the insurance company, and as part of his job, he investigated and eventually found the painting. Now, he's suing her for the $50k because she refused to pay. The question is about who would win in court.

Hmm, I think this is about whether there was a valid contract between them. Contracts require offer, acceptance, and consideration. The woman offered $50k to recover the painting. The detective accepted by investigating, right? But wait, was there consideration?

Consideration means both parties must give something of value. The woman is promising $50k, but what is the detective giving? Well, he's a detective employed by the insurance company, so he's already getting paid to do his job. If he's just doing his regular duties, then maybe there's no additional consideration. 

I recall something about pre-existing duties. If someone is already obligated to do something, like the detective here being paid by the insurance company, then doing that thing doesn't count as consideration. So, if the detective was just doing his job, the woman's promise might not be enforceable because there's no new consideration.

Wait, but what about the argument that he went above and beyond? The question says he investigated as part of his job for three weeks. It doesn't mention him doing extra work beyond his duties. So maybe he didn't do anything extra. So the consideration from the detective's side is lacking because he was already supposed to investigate. 

Let me look at the options. Option C says the detective was already paid by the insurance company, so the woman's promise was gratuitous. Option J says the same, that he was performing his job for which he was already compensated. 

Option B says her promise was gratuitous, which I think means without consideration. So both C and J and B could be possible. But B is more about the promise being gratuitous, while C and J point to the detective's pre-existing duty.

Wait, but the woman's promise was in exchange for the detective's action. If the detective was already under a duty to the insurance company, then his action (recovering the painting) doesn't count as consideration for the woman's promise. So the contract would fail for lack of consideration.

So the detective can't enforce the promise because there was no consideration from his side beyond his existing job duties. Therefore, the woman would win because the promise wasn't supported by consideration.

Looking at the options again:

Option C: The woman, because the detective was already paid by the insurance company for his services. That makes sense because his actions were part of his job, so no new consideration.

Option J: The woman, because the detective was performing his job, for which he was already compensated. This is similar to C but phrased differently.

Wait, but option C says "his investigative services" were already paid by the insurance company. That's correct because the detective's job was to investigate, so his services were covered. So the woman's promise didn't get anything extra beyond what he was already required to do.

So between C and J, which one is better? Let me think. Option C points out that the detective was paid by the insurance company, so no consideration. Option J says he was performing his job, which he was already compensated for. Both seem correct, but perhaps J is more directly about the pre-existing duty, while C is about the source of payment.

Wait, but the insurance company's duty is to the insured (the woman), but the detective's duty is to the insurance company. His job is to investigate thefts for the insurance company. So when the woman promised extra, the detective's action of investigating was part of his job, so no new consideration. Therefore, the woman's promise was without consideration, so no contract.

So the correct answer would be either C or J. Wait, but looking again, the options:

Option C: Woman wins because detective was already paid by insurance company.

Option J: Woman wins because he was performing his job, already compensated.

Hmm, perhaps both are correct, but the better answer is J, because it's about the pre-existing duty to perform the service as part of his job. So the detective's actions were within the scope of his employment, so no consideration beyond that.

Another point: the woman's promise was an offer for the detective to do something extra. But if he was already supposed to do it as part of his job, then there's no consideration. So the contract is not enforceable.

So the answer should be J: The woman, because the detective was performing his job, for which he was already compensated.

Wait, but option C says the detective was paid by the insurance company. So the consideration would be from the insurance company, not the woman. The woman's promise was outside of that. So perhaps the detective didn't provide any consideration to the woman beyond his existing duties.

Yes, so the absence of consideration means the woman's promise isn't binding. So the detective can't enforce it.

Looking again, option C and J both point to the detective being paid, but the reasoning is about consideration. So the best answer is J, because it directly addresses that the detective was already being compensated for the work he did, so there's no consideration for the woman's promise.

Wait, but option C says the detective was already paid by the insurance company for his services. So the detective's act of investigating was part of his job, which was already compensated by the insurance company, not the woman. Therefore, the woman's promise lacks consideration.

So either C or J is correct, but perhaps the more precise answer is J.

Wait, another thought: the detective's investigation led to the recovery, but he was already doing his job. So the consideration (his act) was not beyond his existing duty.

So the correct answer is J: The woman, because the detective was performing his job, for which he was already compensated.

The question revolves around whether the detective can enforce the woman's promise of $50,000 for recovering the stolen painting. For a contract to be enforceable, there must be offer, acceptance, and consideration. The woman made an offer, and the detective accepted by investigating and recovering the painting. However, the critical issue is whether there was sufficient consideration from the detective.

The detective was employed by the insurance company to investigate thefts, including this one, and was already compensated for his services. His actions in investigating and recovering the painting were part of his job duties. In contract law, performing a pre-existing duty does not constitute valid consideration. Therefore, the detective's actions, being within the scope of his employment, did not provide new consideration for the woman's promise.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option C** highlights that the detective was already paid by the insurance company for his investigative services, which aligns with the lack of consideration from the detective.
- **Option J** emphasizes that the detective was performing his job, for which he was already compensated, directly addressing the pre-existing duty and lack of consideration.

While both options C and J are valid, option J more precisely captures the essence of the pre-existing duty doctrine, making it the better answer.

ANSWER: J
