Question:

When one uses a time-series design to evaluate a program, fluctuation in the outcome slope can be accounted for by various alternative hypotheses. According to Campbell and Stanley, the most probable alternative is that

Options:

A: the outcome measure was not sensitive enough
B: a simultaneous event produced the fluctuation
C: the participants did not understand the program
D: the data was not analyzed correctly
E: the program was not implemented correctly
F: the fluctuation was due to random chance
G: participants dropped out of the group, reducing the size of the sample
H: aging effects were unduly influential
I: testâ€”retest reliability is inadequate
J: the time-series design was flawed

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about time-series designs in program evaluation. Hmm, I remember that time-series designs involve taking multiple measurements over time before and after an intervention to see if there's a change. The question is about what alternative hypothesis explains fluctuations in the outcome slope according to Campbell and Stanley.

The options are A through J. Let me think about each one.

The question says that when using a time-series design, fluctuations in the outcome slope can be due to various alternative hypotheses. The most probable alternative according to Campbell and Stanley is what?

I recall that one of the main issues with time-series designs is the possibility of other events occurring during the measurement periods that could affect the results. So, like, if something else happens at the same time as the program, it might cause changes that aren't due to the program itself.

Looking at the options, option B says a simultaneous event produced the fluctuation. That sounds right because other events could naturally cause changes in the data. Another possibility is option F, which is random chance. But I think Campbell and Stanley emphasized that it's more likely another event than just random fluctuation.

Option I mentions test-retest reliability. If the measure isn't reliable, that could cause noise, but I think the main alternative they point out is other events. Also, option H is about aging effects, which might be a factor but again, I think simultaneous events are more likely.

So putting it together, the most probable alternative hypothesis is that a simultaneous event caused the fluctuation. So the answer should be B.

The correct answer is B. According to Campbell and Stanley, when evaluating a program using a time-series design, the most probable alternative hypothesis to explain fluctuations in the outcome slope is that a simultaneous event produced the fluctuation. This is because external events occurring during the measurement periods can influence the results, making them a more likely explanation than other factors like random chance or test-retest reliability.
