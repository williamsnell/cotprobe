Question:

A woman broke her leg while skiing. She was taken to a hospital where she was treated by a doctor who determined that the woman would need surgery to set the broken bones so that they would heal properly. During the surgery, the doctor inserted several metal screws into the woman's leg to hold the bones together. Although the hospital charged the woman a substantial fee for the doctor's services, the bill did not include a separate charge for the cost of the bone screws. A few months after the surgery, the woman's leg still was not fully healed. The doctor eventually concluded that the screws that were inserted into the woman's leg had been defective. The woman was forced to have a second surgery to replace the defective screws. If the woman asserts a strict tort liability claim against the doctor and the hospital for using defective screws in her surgery, she will most likely

Options:

A: not prevail, because the doctor and the hospital can argue that the defect was not apparent during the surgery.
B: prevail, because the doctor and the hospital provided a product to her that was defective and unreasonably dangerous.
C: prevail, because the doctor and the hospital failed to provide a follow-up check on the screws used.
D: prevail, because the hospital and the doctor were negligent in their duty to ensure the safety of medical devices used.
E: not prevail, because the doctor and the hospital did not manufacture the screws and, therefore, the defect in the screws was not their fault.
F: not prevail, because the doctor and the hospital will be treated as service providers rather than product sellers.
G: not prevail, because the hospital did not separately charge for the screws, thus they cannot be held responsible.
H: prevail, because the doctor and the hospital did not inform her about the potential risks of defective screws.
I: not prevail, because the doctor and the hospital are not liable for defects in medical devices they did not manufacture.
J: prevail, because the doctor and the hospital probably would have realized the screws were defective if they had carefully examined them.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this tort liability question. Let's break it down step by step. The scenario is about a woman who had surgery where the doctor used metal screws that turned out to be defective, leading to another surgery. She's suing under strict tort liability.

First, I remember that strict liability applies to manufacturers and sometimes sellers of products. In strict product liability, the plaintiff doesn't need to prove negligence, just that the product was defective and caused the injury. But here, the defendants are the doctor and the hospital, not the manufacturer.

So the question is whether a doctor or hospital can be held strictly liable for using a defective product. From what I recall, under strict liability, it's usually the manufacturer who is liable because they made the product. Sellers, like retailers, can sometimes be liable too, but healthcare providers are a bit different.

I think there's a distinction between providers of services and sellers of products. Doctors and hospitals are primarily providing services, not selling products. The screws here are a medical product used in the surgery, but the hospital didn't charge separately for them. That might mean they're part of the service, not a product sale.

In some cases, if the provider is also the seller, like if they sell a product as part of their service, they might be held strictly liable. But in this case, the bill didn't include a separate charge for the screws. So it seems like the screws were part of the medical service provided, not a separate product sold.

Another angle is whether the doctor or hospital could be considered as having manufactured the screws. Obviously, they didn't make them, so that's not the case. They're just users of the product. So under strict liability, the manufacturer would be the one responsible, not the doctor or hospital.

Looking at the options:

Option B says they provided a defective product. But if they weren't selling it as a product, maybe this doesn't apply.

Option E and I say that since they didn't manufacture the screws, they aren't liable. That makes sense because strict liability is usually on the manufacturer.

Option F suggests they're service providers, not product sellers. So they wouldn't be strictly liable under product liability laws.

Option A talks about the defect not being apparent. I think in strict liability, the provider doesn't need to know about the defect, so this might not matter.

Option D is about negligence, but the question is about strict liability, not negligence. So D isn't the right approach here.

Option G says because there was no separate charge, they aren't liable. That seems more about whether they were selling the product or including it in their service. If it's part of the service, then no strict liability as a seller.

So putting it all together, the doctor and hospital probably aren't strictly liable because they're service providers, not manufacturers or sellers of the screws. Therefore, the answer might be F or E or I.

Wait, option F says treated as service providers rather than product sellers. That would mean they can't be held strictly liable under product liability. Option E and I say they aren't liable because they didn't make the screws. But the reasoning in F is about being service providers, which I think is the key here.

So the woman's claim would likely fail because the doctor and hospital are service providers, not product sellers, so strict liability doesn't apply to them. The correct answer is F: not prevail because they're treated as service providers rather than product sellers.

The woman's strict tort liability claim against the doctor and the hospital for using defective screws in her surgery is unlikely to succeed. Strict liability typically applies to manufacturers and, in some cases, sellers of products. However, in this scenario, the doctor and the hospital are primarily service providers, not product sellers. The screws were used as part of the surgical service, and the hospital did not charge separately for them, indicating they were not sold as a product. Since the doctor and the hospital did not manufacture the screws, they cannot be held strictly liable for the defect. The key distinction here is that they are treated as service providers rather than product sellers, which exempts them from strict liability in this context.

The correct answer is **F**.
