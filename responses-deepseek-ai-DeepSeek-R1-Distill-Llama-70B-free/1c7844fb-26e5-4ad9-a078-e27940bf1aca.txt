Okay, so I've got this differential equation problem here. Hmm, let me see. The equation is 4y'' +12y' +9y =0. And the initial conditions are y(0)=1 and y'(0)=-4. I need to find where the solution equals zero. The options are all decimal numbers, so the answer is probably one of those.

First, I remember that this is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation. The standard approach is to find the characteristic equation. Right, the characteristic equation for ay'' + by' + cy =0 is ar² + br + c =0. So here, a is 4, b is 12, c is 9.

So the characteristic equation is 4r² +12r +9=0. Let's solve for r. Using the quadratic formula: r = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)]/(2a). Plugging in the numbers: b² is 144, 4ac is 4*4*9=144. So the discriminant is 144 -144 =0. Oh, so we have a repeated root.

So the roots are r = [-12 ±0]/(2*4) = -12/8 = -3/2. So r is -1.5, a repeated root.

In this case, the general solution is y(t) = (C1 + C2 t) e^{rt}, where r is the repeated root. So substituting r = -3/2, the solution becomes y(t) = (C1 + C2 t) e^(-3t/2).

Now, apply the initial conditions. First, y(0)=1. Plugging t=0 into y(t): y(0)= (C1 + 0)*e^0 = C1 *1 = C1. So C1 is 1.

Next, find y'(t). Let's compute the derivative of y(t). Using product rule: y'(t) = derivative of (C1 + C2 t) times e^{-3t/2} plus (C1 + C2 t) times derivative of e^{-3t/2}.

Derivative of (C1 + C2 t) is C2. The derivative of e^{-3t/2} is (-3/2)e^{-3t/2}. So putting it together:

y'(t) = C2 e^{-3t/2} + (C1 + C2 t)(-3/2)e^{-3t/2}.

We can factor out e^{-3t/2}:

y'(t) = e^{-3t/2} [ C2 - (3/2)(C1 + C2 t) ].

Now, apply y'(0) = -4. Plugging t=0 into y'(t):

y'(0) = e^{0} [ C2 - (3/2)(C1 + 0) ] = C2 - (3/2)C1.

We already know C1 is 1, so:

-4 = C2 - (3/2)(1) => C2 = -4 + 3/2.

Wait, wait, 3/2 is 1.5. So -4 +1.5 is -2.5, which is -5/2. So C2 is -5/2.

So the solution is y(t) = (1 - (5/2) t) e^{-3t/2}.

Now, we need to find when y(t) equals zero. So set y(t) =0:

(1 - (5/2) t) e^{-3t/2} = 0.

Since e^{-3t/2} is never zero, the equation reduces to 1 - (5/2) t =0.

Solving for t: 1 = (5/2) t => t = 2/5. 2 divided by 5 is 0.4.

So the solution is zero at t=0.4. Looking at the options, option E is 0.4. So the answer should be E.

To solve the initial value problem 

$$
4 y^{\prime \prime} + 12 y^{\prime} + 9 y = 0, \quad y(0) = 1, \quad y^{\prime}(0) = -4,
$$

we first recognize that this is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation. The characteristic equation is:

$$
4r^2 + 12r + 9 = 0.
$$

Using the quadratic formula, 

$$
r = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a},
$$

we find that the discriminant is zero ($b^2 - 4ac = 144 - 144 = 0$), indicating a repeated root. Solving for $r$, we get:

$$
r = \frac{-12}{8} = -\frac{3}{2}.
$$

Thus, the general solution is:

$$
y(t) = (C_1 + C_2 t) e^{-\frac{3}{2}t}.
$$

Applying the initial condition $y(0) = 1$, we substitute $t = 0$ into the solution:

$$
y(0) = (C_1 + 0) e^0 = C_1.
$$

This gives $C_1 = 1$. Next, we compute the derivative of $y(t)$:

$$
y'(t) = C_2 e^{-\frac{3}{2}t} + (C_1 + C_2 t) \left(-\frac{3}{2} e^{-\frac{3}{2}t}\right).
$$

Factoring out $e^{-\frac{3}{2}t}$:

$$
y'(t) = e^{-\frac{3}{2}t} \left[C_2 - \frac{3}{2}(C_1 + C_2 t)\right].
$$

Applying the initial condition $y'(0) = -4$, we substitute $t = 0$:

$$
y'(0) = C_2 - \frac{3}{2}C_1.
$$

Since $C_1 = 1$, this simplifies to:

$$
-4 = C_2 - \frac{3}{2}(1) \implies C_2 = -4 + 1.5 = -2.5 = -\frac{5}{2}.
$$

Thus, the solution is:

$$
y(t) = \left(1 - \frac{5}{2}t\right) e^{-\frac{3}{2}t}.
$$

To find where the solution equals zero, we set $y(t) = 0$. Since $e^{-\frac{3}{2}t}$ is never zero, we solve:

$$
1 - \frac{5}{2}t = 0 \implies t = \frac{2}{5} = 0.4.
$$

Therefore, the solution has the value zero at $t = 0.4$. The correct answer is:

**E: 0.4**
