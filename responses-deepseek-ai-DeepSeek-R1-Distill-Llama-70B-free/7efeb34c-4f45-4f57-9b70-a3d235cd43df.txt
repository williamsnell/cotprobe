Okay, so I've got this question about temperature and what it's proportional to in a substance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my thermodynamics, but let me think this through.

The question is asking, "Temperature is generally proportional to a substance’s..." and then there are a bunch of options. I remember that temperature has something to do with the motion of particles, but I'm not exactly sure which kind of energy.

Wait, I think it's related to kinetic energy. But wait, which type? There's translational, rotational, vibrational... Oh right, I remember something about the kinetic theory of matter. So, according to that, temperature is related to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance.

But the options include both translational and vibrational. I think translational is the main one because that's the motion from one place to another, whereas vibrational is like atoms vibrating in place, especially in solids. Oh wait, and rotational too—like spinning around. But the key here is average translational kinetic energy.

So the correct answer should be G: average translational kinetic energy. Because if the particles are moving faster on average (higher translational kinetic energy), the temperature is higher. That makes sense. The temperature is a measure of that average.

Looking at the options again: A is potential energy. No, that's not right. Potential is about position or configuration, not motion. B is rotational kinetic energy—maybe that's part of it, but I think it's specifically the translational part that defines temperature. C is radiational energy, which is about electromagnetic waves, not the same as thermal energy. D is chemical energy—no, that's stored energy. E is vibrational—again, a different mode. F is gravitational, which doesn't apply here. G is the one I think is correct. H is thermal energy—wait, thermal energy is the total internal energy, not just the average. So temperature isn't proportional to thermal energy, it's proportional to the average translational part. I is electrical, J is magnetic—definitely not related.

Temperature is a measure of the average translational kinetic energy of particles in a substance. According to the kinetic theory of matter, as the translational motion of particles increases, the temperature of the substance rises. This makes option G: average translational kinetic energy the correct answer. Other forms of energy, such as rotational or vibrational kinetic energy, contribute to the total internal (thermal) energy but are not directly proportional to temperature. 

Answer: G
