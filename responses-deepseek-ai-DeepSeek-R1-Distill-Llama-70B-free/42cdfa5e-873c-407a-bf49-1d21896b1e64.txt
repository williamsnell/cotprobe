Okay, so I've got this problem about determining the diffusivity of a binary gas system using some experimental data. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, let's read the problem again. It says that pure nitrogen is passed over the opening of a long narrow test tube filled with liquid cyclohexane. The liquid is filled to 11 cm below the top. The temperature is 17°C, which is 290.15 K in Kelvin, and the pressure is 1 atm. After 20.2 hours, the liquid level drops by 0.22 cm. I need to find the diffusivity from the given options.

Wait, I remember something about this. I think it's related to Graham's law or Fick's law, maybe? Oh right, when a gas diffuses into a liquid, the rate of diffusion can be measured. The setup here is like a capillary tube with a liquid, and the gas diffusing into it causes the liquid level to drop over time. So the diffusivity is the measure of how fast the gas molecules diffuse into the liquid.

I think the formula for this kind of problem is derived from Fick's law of diffusion. The equation might involve the time, the change in height, and some other constants. Let me try to recall the exact formula.

Oh wait, I think the formula is something like D = (π * h² * t) / (8 * η * L), but I'm not sure if that's right. Or maybe it's related to the Stefan problem, where the movement of the liquid is due to diffusion. Alternatively, another approach is using the equation for the diffusion coefficient based on the time it takes for the liquid level to change.

Wait, I remember there's a specific formula for this exact setup. Let me think. So the test tube is narrow, which suggests that the flow is laminar and that it's a one-dimensional problem. The liquid level drops as the gas diffuses into the liquid, reducing the volume of the liquid. But since the tube is narrow and long, maybe it's modeled as a cylindrical system.

Another approach: The rate at which the gas diffuses is proportional to the concentration gradient. But I'm not sure how that directly ties into the level drop.

Wait, I think the correct formula for this scenario is derived from Fick's law and the geometry of the tube. The formula I remember is:

D = ( (h²) * (R*T) ) / ( (16 * η * t) * (A) ) )

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the equation might be D = (h²)/(8 t) ) * something. Wait, perhaps I should look up the correct formula.

Wait, I'm sorry, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The situation is that a gas is diffusing into a liquid in a capillary tube, causing the liquid to drop. The time it takes for this to happen is related to the diffusion coefficient.

I think the formula is D = ( (h^2) * (R*T) ) / ( (16 * t * η) ) ), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, it might involve the viscosity η of the gas or the liquid. Wait, no, in this case, the gas is nitrogen diffusing into the liquid cyclohexane, so viscosity would be that of the liquid? Or maybe the gas's viscosity?

Wait, no, the liquid is the medium through which the gas is diffusing, so the viscosity would be that of the liquid, cyclohexane. Or is it the gas's? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait another thought: The formula I've come across before is D = ( (h^2) ) / (8 t) ) * (1/η) * something else. Or perhaps D is proportional to h² over time, but I'm not getting it right.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to look for the formula used in the capillary rise or fall method for determining diffusion coefficients. Oh wait, I think the formula is:

D = ( (h^2) * (R*T) ) / ( (16 * t * η) )

But I'm not certain. Let me try to work it out.

Wait, another possibility: the formula might be D = ( (h^2) ) / (8 * t) ), but then where do the other variables like temperature and pressure come into play? Maybe I'm missing some constants.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula involves the molar volume or the density of the liquid. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let's try to approach it systematically.

First, the problem gives me the height the liquid level dropped (0.22 cm) over a certain time (20.2 hours). The tube is narrow, so the volume change can be calculated from the cross-sectional area of the tube times the change in height. But wait, the tube's length is given as filled to 11 cm below the top, but perhaps that's the initial height of the liquid in the tube. So the length of the liquid column is 11 cm initially, and it drops by 0.22 cm. But for the formula, perhaps the change in height (delta h) is 0.22 cm, which is 0.22 cm = 0.0022 meters.

Wait, but the formula probably uses the square of the height. So maybe D is proportional to h² divided by time. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I think the correct formula for the diffusion coefficient in this setup is:

D = ( (h^2) * (R*T) ) / ( (16 * η * t) )

Where:
- h is the height of the liquid column (in meters)
- R is the gas constant
- T is the temperature in Kelvin
- η is the viscosity of the liquid
- t is the time in seconds

Wait, but I'm not sure about this. Let me see. The derivation probably involves Fick's law and Poiseuille's law for viscous flow, considering that the gas diffusing into the liquid causes a pressure gradient that drives the flow.

Wait, I think the correct formula is D = (h²)/(8 t) * (1/η) * (R T) / (M), where M is the molar mass. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's D = (h^2 R T) / (16 η t). Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for the formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the viscosity of cyclohexane at 17°C is needed, but I don't have that value. Wait, wait, the question is multiple choice, so maybe I can figure it out without knowing the exact formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is D = ( (h^2) ) / (8 t) ), but that doesn't include temperature or pressure. So that can't be right because the options are in the order of 1e-5 ft²/sec, which suggests that the formula involves more variables.

Wait, maybe I should consider the units. The options are in ft²/sec, which is area per time. The diffusion coefficient D has units of m²/s or ft²/s. So the formula must produce units of ft²/s.

So, let's think about the variables:

h is the change in height (0.22 cm = 0.22e-2 m = 0.0022 m)
t is 20.2 hours, which is 20.2 * 3600 seconds = 72600 seconds
Temperature T is 17°C = 290.15 K
Pressure is 1 atm, which is 101325 Pa
Viscosity η: Oh wait, I don't have the value for cyclohexane's viscosity at this temperature. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I'm supposed to know it or it's given elsewhere. Wait, perhaps it's a standard value, like around 1 mPa·s? Wait, cyclohexane's viscosity at 20°C is about 0.98 mPa·s, so at 17°C it's a bit higher, maybe 1 mPa·s? So η ≈ 0.001 Pa·s.

Wait, but if I don't have the exact value, I can't compute it. Hmm, maybe the question expects me to use a certain formula that doesn't require η? Or perhaps I'm missing a key point here.

Wait another thought: Maybe the problem is using the ideal gas law to relate pressure, volume, and moles, and then applying Fick's law. Let me think.

The nitrogen gas is diffusing into the cyclohexane. The rate of diffusion is determined by Fick's law, which is J = -D * (dc/dx), where J is the flux, D is diffusivity, and dc/dx is the concentration gradient.

But integrating this over the length of the tube might give the total amount of gas that has diffused in time t, causing the liquid level to drop.

Wait, the change in volume of the liquid is πr²Δh, where r is the radius of the tube. But since the tube is narrow, we can assume it's a cylinder with a certain cross-sectional area. But without knowing the radius, perhaps it's accounted for in the formula.

Alternatively, I've heard of the Loschmidt cell experiment, where the diffusion of gases is measured. Maybe that's applicable here.

Wait, another approach: The rate at which the liquid level drops is related to the molar flux of the gas into the liquid. The flux J can be expressed as J = D * (C2 - C1) / L, where L is the length over which diffusion occurs. But I'm not sure how this connects to the liquid level.

Alternatively, considering that the volume of gas that has diffused into the liquid is equal to the volume decrease of the liquid, which is πr²Δh. But the gas is at 1 atm, so the moles of gas that have dissolved can be found using PV = nRT.

So, the volume that the gas occupies is equal to the volume decrease of the liquid, which is πr²Δh. But the pressure is 1 atm, so the moles of gas are n = (P * V) / (RT).

But then, the flux would be n/t = (P * πr²Δh) / (R T t). And flux is also equal to D * (C_initial - C_final) / L, but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to relate the change in height to the amount of gas that has diffused into the liquid. Let's try that.

The volume of gas that has diffused into the liquid is equal to the volume decrease of the liquid, which is A * Δh, where A is the cross-sectional area of the tube. Assuming the tube has a constant cross-section, A = πr².

But the problem is that we don't know the radius of the tube, so perhaps this will cancel out in the formula.

Wait, but the flux J is defined as the amount of substance per unit area per unit time. So J = n / (A * t) ) = (P * V) / (A * t * R T) ). Since V = A * Δh, then J = (P * A * Δh) / (A * t * R T) ) = (P Δh) / (t R T).

But Fick's law says J = D * (C2 - C1) / L, where L is the length over which diffusion occurs. Wait, but in this case, the length L would be the height of the liquid column, h. So C1 is the concentration at the top (which is zero, since it's pure nitrogen), and C2 is the concentration at the bottom, which is the solubility of nitrogen in cyclohexane. Hmm, but wait, the concentration gradient would be from the gas phase into the liquid, so C_initial is the solubility, and C_final is zero at the top, leading to a gradient of C_initial over the height h.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to find the formula for D in terms of the given variables.

After some thinking, I remember that the formula for the diffusion coefficient in this setup is:

D = ( (h^2) * R*T ) / (16 * η * t )

But I'm not entirely sure about the constants. Let me check the derivation.

Wait, the derivation comes from considering the flow of the liquid due to the diffusion of the gas. The flow is laminar, so Poiseuille's law applies, which relates flow rate to pressure gradient and viscosity. The pressure gradient is due to the gas dissolving and creating a partial vacuum as the liquid level drops.

But perhaps a better approach is to use the formula:

D = ( (h^2) * (R*T) ) / ( (16 * η * t) )

Where h is the height of the liquid column in meters, R is the gas constant, T is temperature in Kelvin, η is the viscosity of the liquid in Pa·s, and t is the time in seconds.

Let me plug in the numbers I have.

First, h is the height the liquid dropped, which is 0.22 cm = 0.0022 m.

Wait, wait, is h the initial height of the liquid or the change in height? I think in the formula, h is the initial height of the liquid in the tube. But in the problem, the initial height is 11 cm, and it drops by 0.22 cm. So perhaps h is 11 cm = 0.11 m.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe h is the change in height. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, let me think again. If the liquid level drops by 0.22 cm over 20.2 hours, that's the Δh. So perhaps the formula uses Δh, not the initial h. Because the change in height is what relates to the amount of gas diffused.

But I'm not certain. Another possibility is that the formula uses the square of the height, so h would be the initial height, 11 cm.

Wait, let me try to find the formula. After some research in my notes, I find that the correct formula is:

D = (h²)/(8 t) * (1/η_rel) * something, but I'm not recalling it exactly.

Alternatively, the formula might be:

D = ( (h^2) * (R*T) ) / (16 * η * t )

So let's try that.

Given:
h = 0.11 m (11 cm)
T = 290.15 K
t = 20.2 hours = 20.2 * 3600 = 72600 seconds
η = viscosity of cyclohexane at 17°C. I think it's around 0.0091 Pa·s. Wait, let me check. At 20°C, cyclohexane has a viscosity of about 0.98 mPa·s, so 0.00098 Pa·s. But at 17°C, it would be higher. Maybe around 0.001 Pa·s. Let's say η = 0.001 Pa·s for the calculation.

R is the gas constant, which is 8.314 J/(mol·K).

Plugging in:

D = ( (0.11)^2 * 8.314 * 290.15 ) / (16 * 0.001 * 72600 )

Compute numerator: 0.11^2 = 0.0121; 0.0121 * 8.314 ≈ 0.1006; 0.1006 * 290.15 ≈ 29.17.

Denominator: 16 * 0.001 = 0.016; 0.016 * 72600 ≈ 1161.6.

So D ≈ 29.17 / 1161.6 ≈ 0.0251 m²/s.

Wait, that's way too high. Diffusion coefficients are typically on the order of 1e-5 m²/s for gases in liquids. So I must have done something wrong.

Ah, perhaps I mixed up the units. Let me check the units again.

Wait, the formula gives D in m²/s if h is in meters, R in J/(mol·K), T in K, η in Pa·s, and t in seconds.

But getting 0.025 m²/s is way too high. So maybe I have the formula wrong. Alternatively, perhaps h should be the change in height, 0.0022 m.

Let me try h = 0.0022 m.

Numerator: (0.0022)^2 = 4.84e-6; 4.84e-6 * 8.314 ≈ 4.03e-5; 4.03e-5 * 290.15 ≈ 0.01168.

Denominator: 16 * 0.001 * 72600 = 16 * 0.001 = 0.016; 0.016 * 72600 ≈ 1161.6.

So D ≈ 0.01168 / 1161.6 ≈ 1.005e-5 m²/s.

That's about 1e-5 m²/s, which is more reasonable. So D ≈ 1.005e-5 m²/s.

But none of the options are exactly that. Wait, the options are given in ft²/sec. Let me convert 1e-5 m²/s to ft²/s.

1 m² is approximately 10.7639 ft². So 1e-5 m²/s = 1.07639e-4 ft²/s.

Wait, wait, wait, no: 1 m² = (1 m)^2 = (3.28084 ft)^2 ≈ 10.7639 ft².

So 1 m²/s = 10.7639 ft²/s.

So 1.005e-5 m²/s = 1.005e-5 * 10.7639 ≈ 1.082e-4 ft²/s.

But looking at the options, the highest is about 1.1e-4 ft²/s. Let me see the options again.

Options:

A:7.95E-5 ft²/sec

B:8.65E-5

C:12.0E-5

D:10.5E-5

E:7.50E-5

F:9.02E-5

G:10.2E-5

H:11.0E-5

I:9.50E-5

J:8.05E-5

Wait, 1.082e-4 ft²/s is 1.082e-4, which is 1.082 x 10^-4. None of the options are exactly that. The closest option is G:10.2e-5, which is 1.02e-4, and H is 11e-5 (1.1e-4). So maybe my calculation is off because I used h as the change in height
