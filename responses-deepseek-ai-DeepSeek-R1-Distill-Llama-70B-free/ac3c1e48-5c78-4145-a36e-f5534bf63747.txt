Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of fluid dynamics. Let's take it step by step.

Alright, the setup: there's an aquarium tank with a circular hole in its side. The hole has a diameter of 1 cm, so the radius is 0.5 cm. Wait, but I think for calculations, maybe I should convert that to meters because the water level is given in meters. So, diameter is 0.01 meters because 1 cm is 0.01 m. So radius r is 0.005 m.

The water level is 1 m above the hole. So the depth of the water at the hole is 1 meter. The tank is on a smooth plastic surface, which probably means friction is negligible, so any force applied would directly affect the motion.

The seal ruptures, so water will start flowing out. The question is about the force the attendant must apply to prevent the tank from moving. Hmm, okay. So when the water flows out, there's a reaction force. Newton's third law, right? The water is exerting a force on the tank, so the tank exerts an equal and opposite force on the water. But since we're trying to prevent the tank from moving, the attendant must apply a force equal and opposite to that.

Wait, but what's the direction here? If water is exiting the tank, it's pushing the tank in the opposite direction. So the tank would want to move in the direction opposite to the water flow. So the attendant needs to push it the other way to keep it still.

Now, I remember that the force exerted by the fluid is related to the momentum change. The momentum of the fluid as it exits the tank will determine the force. Since the fluid is moving, its mass flow rate times its velocity will give the force.

So, the formula I think is F = (mass flow rate) * velocity. The mass flow rate is density * area * velocity. So putting it together, F = density * area * velocity squared.

Let me write that down:

F = ρ * A * v²

Where ρ is the density of water, A is the area of the hole, and v is the exit velocity of the water.

I know that the density of water is about 1000 kg/m³.

The area A of the hole can be found using the diameter. The diameter is 0.01 m, so radius r is 0.005 m. Area A = π r² = π (0.005)^2 = π * 0.000025 ≈ 7.854e-5 m².

Now, the exit velocity v. I think I can find this using Torricelli's Law, which says that the speed of fluid flowing out of an orifice under the force of gravity is v = sqrt(2gh), where h is the height of the fluid above the hole.

Here, h is 1 m, and g is 9.81 m/s². So v = sqrt(2 * 9.81 * 1) = sqrt(19.62) ≈ 4.43 m/s.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that. So 2*9.81 is 19.62. Square root of that is approximately 4.43 m/s. Yeah, that sounds right.

Now putting it all together:

F = 1000 kg/m³ * 7.854e-5 m² * (4.43 m/s)^2

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, (4.43)^2 is about 19.62 (since 4.4^2 is 19.36, so a little more). Let's compute it exactly: 4.43 * 4.43.

4*4 =16, 4*.43=1.72, .43*4=1.72, .43*.43≈0.1849.

Wait, maybe a better way is 4.43^2:

(4 + 0.43)^2 = 4^2 + 2*4*0.43 + 0.43^2 = 16 + 3.44 + 0.1849 = 19.6249.

So v squared is approximately 19.6249 m²/s².

Now F = 1000 * 7.854e-5 * 19.6249.

Let me compute 7.854e-5 *19.6249 first.

Multiply 7.854e-5 by 20: that's about 1.5708e-3. But since it's 19.6249, it's a bit less. Let me calculate it accurately.

7.854e-5 = 0.00007854.

So 0.00007854 * 19.6249.

Let me compute 7854e-7 *19.6249.

Wait, maybe better to do it as:

0.00007854 * 19.6249 = ?

Let me compute 0.00007854 * 20 = 0.0015708. But since it's 19.6249, which is 20 - 0.3751.

So, 0.00007854 * 20 = 0.0015708.

Then, 0.00007854 * 0.3751 ≈ 0.00002946.

So subtracting: 0.0015708 - 0.00002946 ≈ 0.0015413.

So 7.854e-5 * 19.6249 ≈ 0.0015413.

Then, F = 1000 kg/m³ * 0.0015413 (kg/(s·m)) ) ?

Wait, no, the units: 1000 kg/m³ * m²/s² * m² gives kg·m/s², which is Newtons.

Wait, F = rho * A * v², so units are (kg/m³) * (m²) * (m²/s²) )= kg·m/s² = N.

So, F ≈ 1000 * 0.0015413 = 1.5413 N.

Looking at the options, option F is 1.54 N, which is very close.

But wait, let me check my calculations again because it's easy to make a mistake in the numbers.

Alternative approach: compute each step again.

Compute A: area.

Diameter d=0.01 m → radius r=0.005 m.

A = π r² = π * (0.005)^2 = π * 0.000025 ≈ 7.85398e-5 m².

v = sqrt(2gh) = sqrt(2 *9.81 *1) = sqrt(19.62) ≈4.429 m/s.

Wait, 4.429 squared is 19.62?

Let me compute 4.429^2: 4^2=16, 2*4*0.429=3.432, (0.429)^2≈0.184. So 16 + 3.432 + 0.184=19.616, which is about 19.62, so correct.

So v=4.429 m/s.

v squared: 4.429^2 ≈ 19.616.

Now, F = 1000 kg/m³ * 7.85398e-5 m² *19.616 m²/s².

Compute 7.85398e-5 *19.616:

7.85398e-5 = 0.0000785398.

Multiplying by 19.616:

0.0000785398 *19.616 ≈ let me compute that.

First, 0.0000785398 * 20 = 0.001570796.

But since it's 19.616, which is 20 - 0.384.

So 0.0000785398 * (20 - 0.384) = 0.001570796 - (0.0000785398 *0.384).

Compute 0.0000785398 *0.384:

≈0.0000785398 *0.4 = 0.0000314159, but since it's 0.384, it's 0.384/0.4 = 0.96 of that.

So 0.0000314159 *0.96 ≈ 0.00003015.

So subtracting: 0.001570796 - 0.00003015 = 0.001540646.

So, F = 1000 kg/m³ * 0.001540646 (kg/(s·m)) ) → 1000 * 0.001540646 ≈1.540646 N.

So about 1.54 N, which matches option F.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is about the force the attendant must apply to prevent the tank from moving. So this is the magnitude of the force, and since the tank would move in the opposite direction of the water jet, the attendant needs to apply a force equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

So the correct answer should be approximately 1.54 N, which is option F.
</think>

To determine the force the attendant must apply to prevent the tank from moving, we analyze the forces acting on the system. When the seal ruptures, water flows out of the tank, exerting a force on it due to the momentum change of the water. By Newton's third law, the tank exerts an equal and opposite force on the water. To prevent the tank from moving, the attendant must apply a force equal in magnitude to this reaction force.

The force exerted by the water is given by:

\[
F = \rho \cdot A \cdot v^2
\]

Where:
- \( \rho \) is the density of water (\( 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \)),
- \( A \) is the area of the hole,
- \( v \) is the exit velocity of the water.

### Step 1: Calculate the area of the hole
The diameter of the hole is \( 1 \, \text{cm} = 0.01 \, \text{m} \), so the radius is \( r = 0.005 \, \text{m} \). The area is:

\[
A = \pi r^2 = \pi (0.005)^2 = \pi (0.000025) \approx 7.854 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{m}^2
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the exit velocity of the water
Using Torricelli's Law, the exit velocity is:

\[
v = \sqrt{2gh}
\]

Where \( g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) and \( h = 1 \, \text{m} \). Substituting:

\[
v = \sqrt{2 \cdot 9.81 \cdot 1} = \sqrt{19.62} \approx 4.43 \, \text{m/s}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the force
Substitute \( \rho = 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \), \( A = 7.854 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{m}^2 \), and \( v^2 = (4.43)^2 \approx 19.62 \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2 \) into the force equation:

\[
F = 1000 \cdot 7.854 \times 10^{-5} \cdot 19.62
\]

First, calculate \( 7.854 \times 10^{-5} \cdot 19.62 \):

\[
7.854 \times 10^{-5} \cdot 19.62 \approx 0.0015413
\]

Then:

\[
F = 1000 \cdot 0.0015413 \approx 1.5413 \, \text{N}
\]

### Final Answer
The force the attendant must apply to prevent the tank from moving is approximately \( 1.54 \, \text{N} \), which corresponds to option **F**.
