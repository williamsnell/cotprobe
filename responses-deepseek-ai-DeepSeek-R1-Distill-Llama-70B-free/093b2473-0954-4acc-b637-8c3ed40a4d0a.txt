Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics question. Let me read it carefully. The question says that trade unions are strong enough to bargain a 5% increase in nominal wages. I need to determine how much prices will rise, and how much better off the workers are. The context given is that in the U.S., productivity increases on average by 2% per year.

Hmm, I remember that when wages go up, it can affect prices because companies might pass the increased costs onto consumers. But productivity growth can offset some of that because if workers are producing more, the per-unit cost might not go up as much.

So, the nominal wage increase is 5%, and productivity is 2%. I think the basic idea is that if productivity increases, each unit produced costs less in terms of labor. So, if wages go up by 5%, but productivity (output per worker) goes up by 2%, the net effect on costs per unit would be 5% minus 2%, which is 3%. That would mean that companies might raise prices by 3%. So the price level would increase by 3%.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The cost of labor per unit is (nominal wage increase) minus (productivity increase). So if wages go up 5% and productivity goes up 2%, the cost per unit goes up by 3%. So prices would rise by 3% because companies would adjust their prices to cover the increased costs.

Now, how does this affect the workers? Their nominal wages went up by 5%, but prices also went up by 3%. So their real wage increase is 5% minus 3%, which is 2%. So workers are better off by 2%.

Looking at the options, I need to see which one matches. The options are about how much prices rise and how much workers are better off.

Option A is 2%, but that's the real wage increase, not the price rise. Option B says 0% price rise if wage increase is offset by productivity. That would be if 5% wage increase is offset by 5% productivity, but here productivity is only 2%, so B isn't correct.

Option G is 3% price increase. So that matches the price rise I calculated. Then, the workers' real wage increase is 2%, which would correspond to option A. But wait, the question is about how much prices will rise and how much better off the workers are. Wait, no, the options are each a single answer. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the question gives a single scenario where it asks both how much prices rise and how much better workers are. But the options are each a single percentage. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, no, looking back, the options are each giving a single answer. So the first part is how much prices rise, and the second part is how much better workers are. But each option is a single answer, so perhaps each option is about the price increase, and then the worker's gain is derived from that.

Wait, the question is phrased: "How much do you expect the prices will rise? In the U.S.A. productivity increase on average of 2% per year. How much are the workers better off?"

Wait, perhaps the question is in two parts, but the options are each a single answer, perhaps indicating both. Or maybe each option is a possible answer to the first part, and the second part is inferred.

Wait, perhaps the options are each a possible answer to both parts together. Let me read the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: 2% 

B: 0%, if the wage increase is completely offset by an equal increase in productivity.

C: 7%, assuming a significant gap between wage increase and productivity growth leading to higher inflation.

D:5%

E:4%, considering other economic factors that might contribute to a price increase.

F:2.5%, accounting for a scenario where the wage increase slightly outpaces the combined effect of productivity growth and other inflationary factors.

G:3%

H:6%, assuming prices rise more than the wage increase due to other inflationary pressures.

I:1%

J: Workers are not better off at all; prices rise by 5%, negating the wage increase.

Wait, option J says that prices rise by 5%, which would mean that the real wage increase is zero (5% wage, 5% price). But in our calculation, the price rise is 3%, so real wage is 2% better.

So looking for an option that says prices rise by 3%, which is option G, and worker better off by 2%, but the options don't combine both. Wait, the question is: "how much do you expect the prices will rise? ... How much are the workers better off?"

Wait, perhaps the options are each answering both parts. But no, each option is a single percentage. So perhaps the options are about the price rise, and the worker's gain is separate. Or maybe the options are about the worker's gain.

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read again.

The question is: "How much do you expect the prices will rise? ... How much are the workers better off?" So it's two questions, but the options are each a single answer. So perhaps the options are each answering the price rise part, and the worker's gain is implicitly derived.

Alternatively, the options might be about the worker's real wage gain, but that doesn't fit because the question is about price rise and worker betterment.

Wait, maybe I should focus on the price rise part first. As per my earlier calculation, the price rise would be 3%, which is option G.

Alternatively, if all of the 5% wage increase is passed on as higher prices, then prices would rise by 5% (option D), but that would ignore productivity gains. Since productivity is 2%, the net increase would be 3% (option G).

Then, workers' real wages would increase by 5% (nominal) - 3% (price) = 2% better off. But the options don't have an option that reflects both. So perhaps the question is only about the price rise, and the betterment is a separate calculation.

Wait, perhaps the way the question is phrased is that each option is a possible answer to the entire question, which includes both parts. For example, option A is 2%, which could refer to the price rise, but that doesn't fit with our calculation. Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking only about the price rise, and the worker's betterment is a separate consideration. But the question seems to ask both.

Wait, perhaps the options are each giving the answer to the first part (price rise), and the worker's betterment is derived from that. For example, if the price rises by 3% (option G), then the worker's real wage increases by 2% (5% -3%). So the correct answer for the price rise is G (3%), and the worker is better by 2%, but the options don't include both. So perhaps the answer is G.

Wait, but looking at the options again, perhaps the question is only about the price rise. So the answer would be G:3%.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking how much the workers are better off. Then, the real wage increase is 2%, which is option A.

Wait, but the question is phrased as two separate questions. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B: 0% price increase if wage increase is offset by productivity. Wait, but the wage increase is 5%, and productivity is 2%, so the offset isn't complete. So option B is only possible if productivity is 5%, which it's not. So B is incorrect.

Alternatively, if the wage increase is 5%, and productivity is 2%, then unit labor costs rise by 3%, leading to 3% price increase. So the answer is G:3% price rise, and workers are better off by 2% in real terms.

But since the options don't have both parts, perhaps the correct answer is G for the price rise. Alternatively, the question might be only about the worker's gain, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are each about the worker's real wage gain. So in that case, the real wage gain is 2%, which is option A.

Wait, but the question first asks about the price increase. So the first part is about price rise, and the second part is about worker's gain.

So perhaps the correct answer is G for the price rise, and the worker's gain is 2%, but the options are each single answers. So the question is a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the options are each possible answers to the entire question, implying both the price rise and worker's gain. But none of the options state both.

Wait, looking at option J: Workers are not better off at all; prices rise by 5%, negating the wage increase.

So in this case, prices rise by 5%, same as wage increase, so real wage is 0%. So workers are not better off.

But according to the calculation, prices should rise by 3%, so this isn't the case. So J is incorrect.

Option B: 0% price rise if productivity offset. But since productivity is 2%, only part of the wage increase is offset, so B is incorrect.

So the correct answer for price rise is 3%, which is G.

So I think the answer is G:3%.

The question involves analyzing the impact of a 5% nominal wage increase on price levels and worker well-being, given that productivity grows by 2% annually. 

1. **Price Increase Calculation**:  
   - Nominal wages increase by 5%, and productivity grows by 2%.  
   - The cost of labor per unit rises by the difference: \( 5\% - 2\% = 3\% \).  
   - Assuming companies pass this cost increase onto consumers, prices are expected to rise by **3%**.

2. **Worker Well-being**:  
   - Workers receive a 5% nominal wage increase, but prices also rise by 3%.  
   - The real wage increase is calculated as \( 5\% - 3\% = 2\% \).  
   - Thus, workers are better off by **2%** in real terms.

3. **Option Analysis**:  
   - **Option G (3%)**: Correctly reflects the expected price increase based on the calculation.  
   - Other options either misrepresent the relationship between wage increases, productivity, and price changes or fail to align with the calculated values.

Therefore, the correct answer is **G: 3%**, indicating a 3% rise in prices.

Answer: G
