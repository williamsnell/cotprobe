Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this math problem that Lucy has. Let me read it again. Lucy is making gift baskets, and she puts 3 apples in each one. The question is about finding the number of gift baskets, which they're calling 'b', that she can make with 24 apples. They want the correct number sentence from the options given.

Hmm, alright. So Lucy has 24 apples, and each basket needs 3 apples. So I guess I need to find out how many baskets she can make. That sounds like a division problem because when you have a total and you want to split it into equal parts, you divide.

Wait, let me think. If each basket has 3 apples, then the number of baskets would be the total apples divided by apples per basket. So that would be 24 divided by 3, right? Which is 8. So the equation should be something like 24 divided by 3 equals b.

Looking at the options, let me go through them. Option A is 3 + b =24. No, that's addition, which doesn't make sense here because we're not adding baskets; we're figuring out how many groups of 3 apples there are. 

Option B is b multiplied by 3 equals 24. That's interesting. Because if you have b baskets, each with 3 apples, then b times 3 gives the total apples. So 3b=24. To find b, you would divide both sides by 3, which gives b=8. So this equation is correct because it represents the total apples. But wait, the question is asking for the number of baskets, b. So solving for b would be 24 divided by 3 equals b. So is this option correct? Because it's written as 3 times b equals 24. So if you solve for b, you divide both sides by 3, which gives the correct answer. So option B is a correct equation, but does it directly show how to find b?

Alternatively, let's look at option E: 24 divided by b equals 3. Hmm, that would mean 24/b=3, which would imply b=8, which is correct. So that's another way to write the equation. So both options B and E seem correct, but wait, let me think again.

Wait, the problem is asking for the total number of baskets, so we're trying to find 'b'. So the equation should solve for 'b'. So if I rearrange option B: b × 3 =24, solving for b would be b=24/3. So the equation is correct. Option E is 24 ÷ b =3, which again, solving for b would give b=24/3=8. So both B and E are correct mathematically, but the question is about which number sentence shows how to find 'b'. 

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, it's asking for the equation that represents how to find 'b'. So in option B, you have 3b=24, which you can solve for b by dividing both sides by 3. Option E is 24/b=3, which you can solve by multiplying both sides by b and then dividing by 3. But which one is the more direct way to represent the problem?

Alternatively, there's another approach. Let's think about what 'b' represents. 'b' is the number of baskets. Each basket has 3 apples. So the total apples are 3 times the number of baskets. So 3 * b =24. So that's option B. So the equation would be 3b=24, which is option B. So to find 'b', you would divide 24 by 3, which is what you'd do with this equation.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option B is written as "b × 3 =24", which is the same as 3b=24, so that's correct. Option E is "24 ÷ b =3", which could also be correct because 24 divided by the number of baskets equals 3 apples per basket. So both B and E are correct equations. But the question is about which equation shows how to find 'b', so perhaps the more direct equation is the one where 'b' is the subject.

So in option B, you have to solve for 'b' by dividing both sides by 3, giving b=24/3. In option E, the equation is 24/b=3, and solving for 'b' gives b=24/3. Both are correct, but which one is the better representation of the problem?

Alternatively, another thought: using division to find the number of groups. So the number of baskets is total apples divided by apples per basket. So 24 ÷ 3 = b. So that would be option E: 24 ÷ b =3? Wait no, because if I write it as 24 divided by 3 equals b, that would be 24/3 = b, which would be option G:3 ×24 =b? No, option G is 3×24=b, which is 72, which isn't right.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The correct equation should be 24 divided by 3 equals b. So 24/3 = b. So which option matches that? Looking at the options, option E is 24 ÷ b =3. That's different because it's 24 divided by b equals 3, which would mean that b is 8, which is correct. But the way the equation is written, it's 24 ÷ b =3, not 24 ÷ 3 = b. So perhaps the correct equation is not directly listed as 24/3 =b, but looking through the options, I don't see that exact option. Wait, let me check again.

Looking at all options:

A: 3 + b =24 → No, because it's addition.

B: b ×3=24 → 3b=24 → b=8.

C:24-3=b → 21=b → No.

D: b ÷3=24 → b=72 → No.

E:24 ÷b=3 → b=8.

F:24 +3 =b → b=27 → No.

G:3 ×24 =b →72 → No.

H: b ÷24=3 → b=72 → No.

I:3 -b =24 → Negative number → No.

J:24 ×3 =b →72→ No.

So options B and E both give b=8. But the question is about which equation shows how to find 'b'. So the way you set up the equation is important.

In the problem, each basket uses 3 apples, and you have 24 apples. So the total number of apples is 3 times the number of baskets, which is option B: 3b=24.

Alternatively, you can think of it as dividing the total apples by the number per basket, which would be 24 ÷3 =b. But that equation isn't directly listed. Wait, checking the options, none of them have 24 ÷3 =b. Let me check again.

Wait, option E is 24 ÷b=3. That's different because it's 24 divided by b equals 3. So if you solve for b, you get b=24 ÷3, which is 8. So both B and E lead to the correct answer, but which one is the correct way to set up the equation based on the problem.

So the problem is, Lucy puts 3 apples in each basket, so the number of baskets times 3 equals 24. So 3b=24, which is option B. Alternatively, if you think about it as the total apples divided by apples per basket gives the number of baskets, that would be 24 ÷3 =b, but that's not one of the options. So the way the options are presented, the correct equation is option B: b ×3=24.

Wait, but option E is 24 ÷b=3. If I rearrange that equation, it's the same as 24=3b, which is the same as option B. So both equations are algebraically the same; they're just rearranged. So both B and E are correct, but the question is which one shows how to find 'b'.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "how to find the total number of gift baskets, b". So perhaps the equation should have 'b' by itself on one side. So in option B, you have 3b=24. To solve for 'b', you divide both sides by 3, so b=8. In option E, you have 24 ÷b=3. To solve for 'b', you can rearrange it to 24=3b, which is the same as option B, and then b=8. So both equations are correct, but perhaps the intended answer is option B, because it directly represents the relationship as total apples equals number of baskets times apples per basket.

Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option E, but I'm a bit confused now. Wait, let me think again.

If I have 24 apples and each basket has 3 apples, then the number of baskets is 24 divided by 3. So the equation is 24 ÷3 =b. But that equation isn't among the options directly. However, option E is 24 ÷b=3, which is different. So perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is b ×3=24, which is correct because 3 times the number of baskets gives the total apples. So to find 'b', you'd rearrange it to b=24 ÷3.

So the correct number sentence is option B.
</think>

To determine the total number of gift baskets, \( b \), Lucy can make with 24 apples, we need to set up the correct number sentence. Since each basket contains 3 apples, the total number of apples (24) is equal to the number of baskets multiplied by 3. This relationship can be expressed as:

\[
b \times 3 = 24
\]

This equation directly represents the problem, where the total apples (24) are the product of the number of baskets (\( b \)) and the number of apples per basket (3). To solve for \( b \), one would divide both sides by 3, yielding \( b = 8 \).

While option E (\( 24 \div b = 3 \)) also leads to the correct answer, it is less direct because it requires rearranging the equation to isolate \( b \). Option B (\( b \times 3 = 24 \)) is the most straightforward representation of the problem.
