Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and see what it's asking.

The question is about the commercial preparation of hydrogen chloride gas. It says that when you heat 234 grams of NaCl with excess H2SO4, how many grams of HCl can you get? The balanced equation is provided: 2NaCl + H2SO4 â†’ Na2SO4 + 2HCl. The molecular weights are given as NaCl = 58.5 and HCl = 36.5.

Hmm, so I think this is a stoichiometry problem. I remember that stoichiometry involves using the mole ratios from the balanced equation to find out how much of a product you can get from a certain amount of reactant.

First, I need to find out how many moles of NaCl I have. The mass given is 234 grams, and the molecular weight is 58.5 g/mol. So moles of NaCl = mass / molar mass. Let me calculate that: 234 g / 58.5 g/mol. Let me do that division. 58.5 times 4 is 234, right? Because 58.5 * 4 = 234. So that means 234 /58.5 =4 moles of NaCl.

Now, looking at the balanced equation, the mole ratio of NaCl to HCl is 2:2, which simplifies to 1:1. So for every mole of NaCl, I get one mole of HCl. Wait, no, the ratio is 2 moles of NaCl giving 2 moles of HCl, so it's 1:1. So if I have 4 moles of NaCl, I should get 4 moles of HCl.

But wait, let me double-check the balanced equation. Yes, 2 NaCl gives 2 HCl, so the ratio is 1:1. So 4 moles of NaCl will produce 4 moles of HCl.

Next, I need to convert moles of HCl to grams. The molar mass of HCl is 36.5 g/mol. So mass of HCl = moles * molar mass. That's 4 mol * 36.5 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 4 times 36 is 144, and 4 times 0.5 is 2, so 144+2=146 grams. So that would be 146 grams of HCl.

Wait, but I should make sure that H2SO4 is in excess, so NaCl is the limiting reactant. Since the question says that H2SO4 is in excess, that's correct. So the calculation should be right.

Looking at the options, let me check. Option D is 146 g HCl. So the answer should be D.

Wait, did I make any mistakes in the calculation? Let me go through it again quickly. Moles of NaCl: 234 /58.5 =4. Mole ratio 1:1, so 4 moles HCl. 4 *36.5=146. Yeah, that's correct.

To determine the weight of HCl obtained, we use stoichiometry based on the balanced equation:

**Reaction:**  
\[ 2\text{NaCl} + \text{H}_2\text{SO}_4 \rightarrow \text{Na}_2\text{SO}_4 + 2\text{HCl} \]  

### Steps:
1. **Calculate moles of NaCl:**  
   Given mass of NaCl = 234 g, molar mass of NaCl = 58.5 g/mol.  
   \[ \text{Moles of NaCl} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{234}{58.5} = 4 \, \text{mol} \]

2. **Determine mole ratio:**  
   From the balanced equation, the mole ratio of NaCl to HCl is 1:1. Therefore, 4 moles of NaCl produce 4 moles of HCl.

3. **Convert moles of HCl to grams:**  
   Molar mass of HCl = 36.5 g/mol.  
   \[ \text{Mass of HCl} = \text{Moles} \times \text{Molar Mass} = 4 \times 36.5 = 146 \, \text{g} \]

### Conclusion:  
The weight of HCl obtained is **146 g**. Since H\(_2\)SO\(_4\) is in excess, NaCl is the limiting reactant, confirming the calculation.

**Answer:** D
