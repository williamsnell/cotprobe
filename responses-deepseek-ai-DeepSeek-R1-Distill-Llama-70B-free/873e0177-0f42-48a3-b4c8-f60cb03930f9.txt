Hmm, okay, so I've got this question here about what increases the money supply. I'm a bit rusty on my economics, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again: "The money supply will increase as a result of which of the following?" with options from A to J.

Alright, I remember that the money supply refers to the total amount of money circulating in the economy. It's usually denoted as M1, M2, etc., but for this question, I think the general factors are what matter.

So, let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: An increase in the fraction of deposits that must be held by banks. Wait, that's the reserve requirement. If banks have to hold a larger fraction, they have less to lend out. When banks lend less, the money multiplier decreases, so the money supply would actually decrease. So A would decrease money supply, not increase. So A is not the answer.

Option B: The purchase of bonds by private individuals. Hmm. When private individuals buy bonds, they're taking money out of circulation to pay for them. So that would reduce the money supply. Because the money is moving into bonds, which are a form of savings or investment, but not part of the active money supply. So B would decrease it. So not B.

Option C: An increase in the amount of physical cash in circulation. Wait, physical cash is part of the money supply. So if more cash is circulating, that directly increases M1, which is part of the money supply. So this could be a candidate. But wait, is this the only possible way? Let me think about the other options too.

Option D: A decrease in the amount of money people are saving. If people save less, they spend more. But savings are in bank deposits. If they're saving less, they might be spending, which increases demand, but does that directly affect the money supply? Or is it more about velocity of money? Because the actual quantity of money isn't changing unless the banks make more loans. Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe this doesn't directly increase the money supply. So D might not be the correct answer.

Option E: The Federal Reserve raising interest rates. Raising interest rates usually reduces borrowing because loans become more expensive. If people borrow less, banks make fewer loans, which means less money is created through the lending process. So the money supply would likely decrease. So E is not correct.

Option F: The selling of bonds by the Federal Reserve. Oh, right, this is part of open market operations. When the Fed sells bonds, they take money out of the economy. People and banks buy the bonds, so the money in circulation decreases. This would reduce the money supply. So F isn't the answer.

Option G: An increase in the discount rate. The discount rate is the interest rate the Fed charges banks for loans. If it's higher, banks are less likely to borrow from the Fed. With less borrowing, they have less reserves to lend out, so the money supply would decrease. So G isn't correct.

Option H: The government increasing taxes. Higher taxes mean people have less disposable income. But how does that affect the money supply? Taxes are paid to the government, which uses the funds for spending. But the immediate effect is that the money is taken out of circulation, which might reduce the money supply in the short term. Or does it depend on what the government does with the money? If the government spends the same amount, maybe it's just a transfer. But I'm not sure if this directly increases the money supply. I think this might not be the right choice.

Option I: A decrease in the required reserve ratio. Oh, that makes sense. The required reserve ratio is the percentage of deposits that banks must keep as reserves. If it's decreased, banks can lend out more money. When they lend more, that increases the money supply because each loan creates new money. So a lower reserve ratio would increase the money supply. So I is a strong candidate.

Option J: A decrease in the rate of inflation. Inflation affects the value of money, but does it directly impact the quantity? I don't think so. Lower inflation might mean that the same amount of money buys more, but the actual money supply is about the quantity, not the value. So J probably isn't the answer.

Wait, let me recap. The question is, which option causes the money supply to increase. So the options that would do that: C and I, and maybe D and H, but I'm not sure.

Option C: More physical cash. That would directly increase the money supply because cash is part of it. But cash is only a part of M1. However, the money supply is more than just cash; it includes deposits.

Option I: Lower reserve ratio. This allows banks to make more loans, increasing deposits and thus the broader money supply. So both C and I could increase the money supply. But the question is which option among the choices is correct.

So the options are C and I as possibilities.

Looking back at the question, the options are mutually exclusive, so only one is correct.

If the question is about which action increases the money supply, then both C and I would do that. But let me think about the correct answers.

Wait, the correct answer is I. Because when the required reserve ratio decreases, banks can lend more, thus increasing the money supply through the money multiplier effect. That's a standard tool of monetary policy.

Option C, increasing physical cash, would also increase money supply, but that's more of a passive change. The Fed can't directly control how much cash is in circulation as much as they control reserve ratios. Or wait, the Fed can influence the amount of cash by buying or selling securities. Hmm, but option C is phrased as an increase in cash, which would directly add to the money supply.

Wait, but wait. The money supply is also influenced by the Fed's actions. So, for example, if the Fed does open market operations, buying bonds, that increases the money supply. But none of the options directly state that except perhaps C.

Wait, looking again. Option C says an increase in the amount of physical cash in circulation. That's part of the money supply. So that would directly increase M1. But would it be the correct answer compared to I?

So the question is, which of these actions would cause the money supply to increase.

So if the Fed lowers the required reserve ratio (option I), that allows banks to make more loans, increasing the money supply via the money multiplier. So that's a way to increase money supply.

Alternatively, more cash in circulation (option C) would also increase the money supply.

So which of these is an option in the choices.

Wait, the options are all possible causes. So which of them would cause an increase.

So, perhaps both C and I are correct. But the options have only one correct answer, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let me think again: the money supply is the total of cash plus deposits. So increasing cash (C) would increase the money supply. Lowering the reserve ratio (I) would cause banks to lend more, increasing deposits, thus increasing the money supply.

So both C and I would increase the money supply.

Wait, but the question is which of the options is correct. So perhaps more than one option is correct, but in the given options, only one is an option.

Looking at the options again, I is an option, C is another.

Wait, but the initial options are A to J, and the possible answers are from A to J.

So, the correct answer is either C or I.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think of what each option does.

Option I: Decrease in required reserve ratio. This means banks have to hold less in reserves, so they can lend more. This increases the money supply because each loan creates new money. So I would cause the money supply to increase.

Option C: More physical cash. Cash is part of the money supply, so it directly increases. So both C and I would increase the money supply.

But the question is, which of the following is correct. So perhaps both are correct, but in the options, both are present.

Wait, but looking at the options, the question is from a standard economics question, and I think the correct answer is I. Because the money supply is more influenced by the banking system's ability to lend. Also, the Fed's actions, like changing reserve requirements, are a direct way to influence money supply.

Alternatively, option C could be correct if it's an exogenous increase, but in reality, the Fed can control the cash in circulation through open market operations. So, for example, when the Fed buys bonds, they pay for them by adding cash to the economy, which increases the money supply.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option C says an increase in cash in circulation. So that's similar to the Fed injecting more cash via open market operations, which would increase the money supply.

So, now I'm getting a bit confused. Are both C and I correct?

Wait, let me think again. The question is which action would cause the money supply to increase. So, which options lead to an increase.

Option I: Lowering the required reserve ratio → more lending → more deposits → higher M2 → money supply increases.

Option C: More cash → M1 increases.

So both would increase the money supply. But the options given don't have both as correct, so perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, the question is asking which of the following. So perhaps the correct answer is I and C.

But looking at the options, the answer is given as a single letter. So perhaps the intended answer is I. Because the question is about what the Fed does, perhaps. Or perhaps the correct answer is I because the decrease in the required reserve ratio directly increases the money supply more effectively than just increasing cash.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is I because it's a monetary policy tool, whereas C might be a result of other factors, like public preference for cash.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is I.

Wait, but I'm a bit stuck. Let me think of it this way: the money supply (M1) is cash plus checking deposits. So when the Fed lowers the reserve ratio, banks can make more loans, which increases checking deposits. So the money supply (M1) increases.

Similarly, if more cash is in circulation, M1 increases.

So both C and I would lead to an increase in M1.

But in the options, both C and I are present. So perhaps the correct answer is both, but the options only allow for one selection. So perhaps the question expects one correct answer.

Wait, let me think about what each action does.

Option C: more cash in circulation. That's a direct increase in the money supply, so it's correct.

Option I: decrease in required reserve ratio → more lending → more deposits → more money → correct.

So perhaps both are correct, but looking at the options, only one can be chosen. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think about each option again.

Option A: increase in reserve requirements → less lending → money supply decreases. So A is incorrect.

Option B: purchase of bonds by private individuals → people are buying bonds, so they're using their money. So money in circulation decreases. So B is incorrect.

Option C: increase in cash → money supply increases. So C is correct.

Option D: decrease in savings → people spend more. But the money supply is about the quantity, not the velocity. So D might increase velocity, but not the quantity. So D doesn't increase the money supply.

Option E: Fed raises interest rates → reduces borrowing → reduces money creation. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Fed sells bonds → takes money out of circulation → reduces money supply. So F is incorrect.

Option G: increase discount rate → banks borrow less → less lending → money supply decreases. So G is incorrect.

Option H: government increases taxes → reduces disposable income, but whether it affects the money supply depends. Taxes are paid to the government; if the government spends the money, it might not change much. But higher taxes could reduce consumption. However, I don't think this directly affects the money supply. So H is incorrect.

Option I: decrease in reserve ratio → more lending → more money supply. So I is correct.

Option J: decrease in inflation → affects the value of money, not the quantity. So J is incorrect.

So the correct options are C and I.

But the question asks for which option is correct, implying only one is correct. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is about actions taken by the Federal Reserve. So, which of these actions by the Fed would increase the money supply. Then, option I would be correct because the Fed can lower the required reserve ratio. But option C is about an increase in cash, which could be due to the Fed or other factors.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is I because it's a monetary policy tool that directly affects the money supply, while option C is just a description of a situation.

But in the options given, both are possible. So perhaps the intended answer is I.

Wait, but let me think of the effects. Lowering the required reserve ratio can have a multiplied effect on the money supply, making it a more potent method. So perhaps I is the correct answer.

So, the answer is I: A decrease in the required reserve ratio.

To determine which action increases the money supply, we analyze each option:

- **Option A**: An increase in the fraction of deposits that must be held by banks (reserve requirement) reduces the money supply because banks have less to lend, decreasing the money multiplier. This is incorrect.

- **Option B**: The purchase of bonds by private individuals removes money from circulation, reducing the money supply. This is incorrect.

- **Option C**: An increase in the amount of physical cash in circulation directly increases the money supply, as cash is part of the money supply (e.g., M1). This is correct.

- **Option D**: A decrease in savings could increase spending, but it does not directly increase the quantity of money in circulation. This is incorrect.

- **Option E**: The Federal Reserve raising interest rates reduces borrowing and lending, decreasing the money supply. This is incorrect.

- **Option F**: The Federal Reserve selling bonds reduces the money supply by taking money out of circulation. This is incorrect.

- **Option G**: An increase in the discount rate reduces borrowing by banks, leading to less lending and a decrease in the money supply. This is incorrect.

- **Option H**: The government increasing taxes reduces disposable income but does not directly affect the money supply. This is incorrect.

- **Option I**: A decrease in the required reserve ratio allows banks to lend more, increasing deposits and the broader money supply through the money multiplier effect. This is correct.

- **Option J**: A decrease in the rate of inflation affects the value of money but not the quantity of money. This is incorrect.

Both **Option C** and **Option I** increase the money supply. However, since the question implies a single correct answer, **Option I** is the more direct and potent method of increasing the money supply through monetary policy. Therefore, the best answer is:

**I: A decrease in the required reserve ratio.**

Answer: I
