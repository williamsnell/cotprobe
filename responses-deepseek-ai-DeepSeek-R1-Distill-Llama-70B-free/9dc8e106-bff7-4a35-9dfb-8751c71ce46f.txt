Alright, so I have this question about contracts and offers and acceptances. Let me try to break it down step by step. Okay, the scenario is Calvin Poultry Co. offering to sell Chickenshop 20,000 pounds of chicken at 40 cents per pound under specified delivery terms. Then Chickenshop accepts but adds something about "city scale weight certificate."

Hmm. I remember that in contract law, the offer and acceptance need to be clear. If someone accepts an offer with additional terms, it can sometimes be a problem. So the key here is whether Chickenshop's reply is just an acceptance or if it's a counteroffer or something else.

Wait, I think the general rule is that if the acceptance adds a new condition or changes the terms, it might be considered a counteroffer. But sometimes, if the additional term is just a minor detail or something that's standard, it might still be an acceptance.

So Calvin's offer was for 20k pounds at 40 cents per pound with specified delivery terms. Chickenshop accepted but added that it's per city scale weight certificate. Is that a different term or just specifying how the weight is measured?

I think that in contracts, when the offeree proposes a new term, it's a counteroffer unless the term is merely clarifying or doesn't change the substance. Here, the original offer probably didn't specify the method of weighing, so Chickenshop adding that they'll use the city scale might be introducing a new condition.

Wait, but under the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code), which applies to the sale of goods, the rules are a bit more flexible. The UCC allows for minor additional terms that don't materially change the agreement to still be considered an acceptance, even if they add something new. But if the additional term is a significant change, it might be a counteroffer.

So in this case, specifying the method of weighing could be seen as a minor term. The original offer probably just stated the price per pound without specifying how the weight would be determined. So Chickenshop is adding a specific method. Under the UCC, this might not be a material change, so it could be an acceptance, and the contract is formed with that additional term.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. If the offer didn't specify the method of weighing, and the acceptance does, does that make it a counteroffer or an acceptance with an additional term? Because the UCC says that additional terms in an acceptance become part of the contract unless they materially alter the offer. So if the seller (Calvin) didn't specify the weighing method, and the buyer (Chickenshop) does, it's probably an additional term that's acceptable, making the acceptance valid.

Alternatively, if the original offer was silent on the weighing method, then Chickenshop's addition might be considered a proposal of a new term. But under UCC 2-207, even if the additional terms are different, they can still be part of the contract unless they're conflicting and the offeror objects.

Wait, but in this question, is the offer specific about delivery terms but not about weighing? So the delivery terms might include how weight is determined, or maybe not. If the delivery terms didn't specify, then Chickenshop adding that term could be seen as adding a condition. 

Wait, but if the offer includes delivery terms, and Chickenshop's acceptance is adding a different way to measure the weight, perhaps that's a change in the terms. So for example, if the offer said the price is based on seller's weight, and the acceptance says based on city scale, that's a change. So that would make the acceptance a counteroffer because it's changing a material term.

But in this case, the offer's delivery terms might not have specified the weight method. So Chickenshop is specifying it. Is that a new term or just filling in a detail? If it's a minor point, then under UCC, it's part of the contract. So the acceptance is valid, and the contract is formed with that term.

Wait, but the options don't all say that. Let me look at the options again.

Option G says a contract was formed on Chickenshop's terms. Option B says the contract formed but terms need clarification. Option E says conditional acceptance but not counteroffer.

Hmm. So under UCC, when a buyer accepts but adds a term, if it's a minor term and doesn't contradict, it's an acceptance, and the contract includes that term. So the contract is formed with the additional term. So in this case, Chickenshop's reply added a term about the scale, which is probably a minor term. So the contract is formed on Chickenshop's terms.

So the correct answer would be G: A contract was formed on Chickenshop's terms.

Wait, but wait another point. If the offer had specified the method of weighing, and Chickenshop changed it, that would be a counteroffer. But since the offer didn't specify, the addition is likely an additional term, which under UCC 2-207 becomes part of the contract unless the offeror objects. So yes, the contract is formed with Chickenshop's terms.

The question revolves around contract law principles, specifically the distinction between an acceptance and a counteroffer. Calvin Poultry Co. made an offer to sell Chickenshop 20,000 pounds of chicken at 40 cents per pound under specified delivery terms. Chickenshop accepted the offer but added the condition that the weight would be determined by a "city scale weight certificate." The key issue is whether this addition constitutes an acceptance or a counteroffer.

Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which governs the sale of goods, additional terms in an acceptance are generally allowed unless they materially alter the offer. If the original offer did not specify the method of weighing, Chickenshop's addition of the "city scale weight certificate" could be seen as a minor clarification rather than a material change. Therefore, Chickenshop's reply is likely an acceptance, and the contract is formed with the additional term included.

Given the options, the correct answer is that a contract was formed on Chickenshop's terms, as their addition does not appear to materially alter the original offer.
