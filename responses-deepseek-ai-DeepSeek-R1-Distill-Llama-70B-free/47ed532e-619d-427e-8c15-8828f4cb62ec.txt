Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrologic cycle, and I'm a bit rusty on the concepts, but let me think it through. The question is asking during which process water molecules absorb energy. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

Let me start by recalling what the hydrologic cycle involves. It's all about the movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. The main processes include evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection.

The question specifically asks where water molecules absorb energy. So I remember that when water changes state from liquid to gas, it absorbs heat. That process is called evaporation. Oh wait, but another phase change is when water freezes, but that's releasing energy, right? Because when water turns into ice, it releases heat. So freezing is exothermic.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Water seeping into groundwater reservoirs. That's infiltration, I think. Water moving from the surface into the ground. So it's just moving, not changing state. No energy absorption here.

Option B: Absorption of rainwater by the soil. That's infiltration as well. The soil soaks up the water, but again, it's just water moving into the soil. No phase change, so no energy absorption in terms of state change.

Option C: Formation of a cloud from water vapor. Wait, clouds form when water vapor condenses into liquid droplets. So that's condensation. When water vapor condenses, it releases heat because it's going from gas to liquid. So the molecules are releasing energy, not absorbing it.

Option D: Formation of dew from water vapor. Dew is when water vapor condenses on surfaces, right? So again, that's condensation. So same as cloud formation, it's releasing energy.

Option E: Water flow in rivers and streams. That's just the movement of water, like runoff. No phase change, so no energy absorption.

Option F: Formation of snow from water vapor. Snow forms when water vapor freezes into ice crystals. Freezing is a phase change from gas to solid. Wait, no, water vapor is gas turning directly to solid without going through liquid. So that's deposition. When water vapor turns into ice, does it release or absorb energy? Hmm. Phase changes: melting (solid to liquid) absorbs energy. Vaporization (liquid to gas) absorbs. Freezing (liquid to solid) releases. Deposition (gas to solid) also releases because it's going to a lower energy state.

So snow formation is deposition, so it's releasing energy, not absorbing.

Option G: Formation of ice from water. That's freezing. Water turning into ice. Again, this is exothermic, releasing energy. So no absorption here.

Option H: Runoff along the land surface. That's just water flowing over the ground. No phase change, so no energy involved in that process.

Option I: Evaporation from the ocean surface. Evaporation is when liquid water turns into vapor. This requires energy because the molecules need to gain enough energy to escape the liquid state. So this process absorbs energy, typically from the surroundings, like the sun heating the ocean.

Option J: Formation of fog from water vapor. Fog is tiny water droplets suspended in air, so that's condensation. Again, condensation releases energy as water vapor turns back into liquid.

So the correct answer must be the process where water is absorbing energy. Looking back, that's evaporation. So option I is evaporation from the ocean surface. That fits because during evaporation, water molecules absorb heat energy to transition from liquid to gas.

During the hydrologic cycle, water molecules absorb energy specifically when they transition from a liquid to a gas state. This process is known as evaporation. Among the given options, evaporation from the ocean surface (Option I) is the correct answer because it involves water molecules absorbing energy to change state. Other processes like condensation, freezing, or deposition release energy, while processes like infiltration or runoff do not involve phase changes. Therefore, the correct answer is:

I
