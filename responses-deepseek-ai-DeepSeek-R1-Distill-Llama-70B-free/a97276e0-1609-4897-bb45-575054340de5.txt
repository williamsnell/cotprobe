Okay, so I have this question about stranger anxiety in children, and I need to figure out when it typically begins. Hmm, I remember learning something about developmental psychology, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think.

Stranger anxiety is when babies start feeling scared or uneasy around people they don't know. I think it's a normal part of development, showing that the baby is starting to understand the difference between familiar and unfamiliar people. But when does this usually start?

I recall that infants go through different stages. In the first few months, they don't really show much stranger anxiety. They might just look at everyone. Then, around maybe 6 months or so, they start to show some wariness. Wait, or was it later?

Let me try to break it down. At birth, babies don't have stranger anxiety. They just see faces and start to recognize familiar ones. Around 6 months, they might start to feel uneasy with strangers, but I'm not sure if that's exactly when it begins. Or is it a bit later?

Wait, another thought. I remember reading that stranger anxiety often peaks around 9 months. So if it peaks then, it must have started a couple of months before. Maybe around 6 to 7 months? Or perhaps earlier, like 4 to 6 months?

I'm a bit confused because some sources say it starts as early as 6 months, while others mention it begins around 9 months. Or maybe the peak is at 9 months, but it begins earlier. Let me think about the options provided.

The options are A: 4-6, B:11-13, C:8-10, D:2-3, E:3-5, F:15-18, G:1-2, H:12-14, I:7-9, J:6-7.

If I thought it starts around 6-7 months, then J would be the answer. But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, another angle: I think separation anxiety starts around the same time. Stranger anxiety is a bit different but related.

I think stranger anxiety can begin as early as 6 months, with it becoming more pronounced around 9 months. So the beginning would be around 6 to 7 months, which is option J.

Wait, but I'm not 100% certain. I've also heard that some babies start showing it a bit later, maybe around 8 to 10 months. That would be option C. But I'm more inclined towards the earlier start, around 6 months. So maybe J is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is 8-10 months. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to visualize a child's development timeline. Around 6 months, babies start to have better memory and can recognize familiar faces. So when they see someone new, they might feel anxious. That makes sense. So J:6-7 months would be the start, and then it increases until maybe 9 months.

Yes, I think that's right. So the answer should be J.

For most children, stranger anxiety begins at about 6 to 7 months of age. This is when babies start to show wariness of unfamiliar people, as their memory and ability to recognize faces improve. While stranger anxiety may peak around 9 months, it typically starts earlier, making the correct answer:

Answer: J
