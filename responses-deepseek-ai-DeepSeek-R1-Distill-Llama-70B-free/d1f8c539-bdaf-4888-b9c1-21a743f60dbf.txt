Question:

Stress Inoculation Training involves both skills training and modification of maladaptive cognitions. Which of the following steps is incorrectly defined by a young inexperienced therapist:

Options:

A: SKILLS REHEARSAL→ practicing the newly acquired skills in real or imagined situations
B: PRACTICE→ applying learned skills in controlled, non-threatening situations
C: COGNITION PREPARATION→ education on how faulty cognitions prevent adaptive coping
D: SKILLS ACQUISITION→ learning relaxation, self-statements, escape routes not necessary with rehearsing them
E: PRACTICE→ applies learning to real or imagines situations done on a gradual basis
F: SKILLS ACQUISITION→ learning and rehearsing new skills relaxation, self-statements, escape routes
G: COGNITION PREPARATION→ learning how to identify and correct maladaptive thought patterns
H: COGNITION PREPARATION→ understanding how adaptive coping mechanisms can be hindered by correct cognitions

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about Stress Inoculation Training (SIT). Let me start by recalling what I know about SIT. From what I remember, SIT is a type of cognitive-behavioral therapy that helps individuals manage stress by building their coping skills. It involves three main phases: education (cognitive preparation), skills acquisition and rehearsal, and application (practice) in real-life situations.

The question is asking which step is incorrectly defined by a young therapist. The options are A through H, each describing a step in SIT. I need to go through each option and see which one doesn't fit correctly.

Starting with the steps:

1. **Cognitive Preparation**: This is the first phase where the therapist educates the client about the role of thoughts in stress. They learn to identify and challenge their maladaptive (unhelpful) thoughts. So any option that describes this phase correctly should talk about identifying or understanding faulty cognitions.

2. **Skills Acquisition**: Here, clients learn new coping skills like relaxation techniques, positive self-statements, problem-solving, etc. They also rehearse these skills, maybe in the session, so that they can use them when needed.

3. **Practice/Application**: This phase involves applying the learned skills in real-life situations, starting with less stressful scenarios and gradually moving to more challenging ones. This helps build confidence and competence.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: SKILLS REHEARSAL→ practicing new skills in real or imagined situations. Wait, isn't rehearsal part of skills acquisition? Or is this the application phase? I think skills rehearsal is part of acquisition where they practice in session, and practice (application) is when they apply them in real life. So A seems correct because it's about practicing in real or imagined situations, which sounds like the next step after acquisition.

Option B: PRACTICE→ applying skills in controlled, non-threatening situations. That makes sense because practice starts with easier situations before moving to tougher ones. So B seems correct.

Option C: COGNITION PREPARATION→ education on how faulty cognitions prevent adaptive coping. This aligns with the cognitive preparation phase. So C is correct.

Option D: SKILLS ACQUISITION→ learning relaxation, etc., without rehearsing. Wait, I thought skills acquisition includes both learning and rehearsing. If D says they learn but don't rehearse, that's incorrect. Because in SIT, after learning, they do rehearse the skills. So D is probably the incorrect definition.

Option E: PRACTICE→ applying learning to real or imagined situations gradually. That sounds correct because practice is done in real situations, starting small. So E is correct.

Option F: SKILLS ACQUISITION→ learning and rehearsing skills. That's correct because acquisition includes both learning and rehearsing. So F is correct.

Option G: COGNITION PREPARATION→ learning to identify and correct maladaptive thoughts. That's correct because that's what cognitive preparation is about. So G is correct.

Option H: COGNITION PREPARATION→ understanding how adaptive coping is hindered by correct cognitions. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Correct cognitions should help, not hinder. So H is incorrect because it's talking about correct (adaptive) cognitions hindering coping, which is opposite of what should happen. But wait, the question is about the step being incorrectly defined. So if H says correct cognitions prevent adaptive coping, that's wrong because correct thoughts should help, not hinder.

Wait, but the options are about which step is incorrectly defined. So the incorrect definitions would be either D or H. Let me re-examine.

Option D says "SKILLS ACQUISITION→ learning ... not necessary with rehearsing them." But in SIT, skills acquisition does include rehearsing, so if D says they don't rehearse, that's wrong. So D is incorrect.

Option H says cognition preparation is about correct cognitions hindering. That's incorrect because it's the faulty (maladaptive) ones that hinder. So H's definition is wrong.

Wait, the question is which step is incorrectly defined. So both D and H could be wrong, but the options only have one correct answer.

Looking back, the question is which option is the incorrect definition. Let's see which of these is a step in SIT.

Wait, the options are labeled with the steps. Each option has a step name and a definition. So for each option, the step name is correct, but the definition may be wrong.

So let's re-examine each option:

Option D: SKILLS ACQUISITION→ learning skills without rehearsing. No, because in SIT, skills acquisition includes learning and rehearsing, so D's definition is wrong. So D is incorrect.

Option H: COGNITION PREPARATION→ understanding correct cognitions hinder. No, it's faulty that hinder. So H's definition is wrong.

So both D and H have incorrect definitions, but the options only have one correct answer, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, the question is which step is incorrectly defined. Let me check each:

A: SKILLS REHEARSAL→ practicing in real or imagined. Rehearsal is part of acquisition, but maybe this is part of the application? I think Skills Rehearsal is part of acquisition, so A's definition is correct because it's about practicing, which is part of rehearsal.

Wait, perhaps the steps are as per the standard SIT model. Let me recall the three phases:

1. Cognitive Preparation (Education): Teach about stress and role of cognition.

2. Skills Acquisition and Rehearsal: Learn and practice new skills.

3. Application and Practice: Use the skills in real-life situations.

So the steps are:

- Skills Acquisition: learning new skills and rehearsing.

- Practice: applying in real situations.

So looking again:

Option D: Skills Acquisition is learning without rehearsing. That's wrong, because rehearsal is part of acquisition.

Option F: Skills Acquisition includes learning and rehearsing, which is correct.

Option H: Cognitive Preparation is about correct cognitions hindering, which is wrong.

So the incorrect definitions are D and H. But the question is about which one is incorrect. Wait, the options are A to H, each with a step and definition.

The question is which step is incorrectly defined. So which of these steps is defined incorrectly.

Looking at each option:

Option D: Incorrect because it says no rehearsal in acquisition.

Option H: Incorrect because it's about correct cognitions hindering, which is wrong.

So the question is which option is incorrect. The question states that the incorrect step is defined by the therapist. So both D and H are incorrect, but the options are separate.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, let me think about each step:

- COGNITION PREPARATION: Should involve identifying maladaptive thoughts. So option G correctly describes it, as does C. Option H incorrectly describes it.

- SKILLS ACQUISITION: Should involve learning and rehearsing. So F is correct, D is incorrect.

- SKILLS REHEARSAL: Part of acquisition, so A's definition is about practicing in real or imagined, which might actually be more about application.

Wait, Skills Rehearsal is part of the acquisition phase, where the client practices the skills in controlled situations, maybe imagined. Then Practice is applying them in real situations.

So option A says Skills Rehearsal is practicing in real or imagined. That's correct because rehearsal can involve imagined scenarios. So A is correct.

Option E says Practice applies learning to real or imagined on a gradual basis. That sounds correct because practice starts with easier situations, which could be real or imagined.

Wait, but Practice is usually in real, controlled situations. So maybe E's definition is correct.

So, the incorrect options are D and H. But the question is which is incorrectly defined. Now, looking at the options, only one can be the answer.

The question provides options A to H, each with a step and definition. The incorrect one is the therapist's mistake.

So the incorrect definitions are:

- D: Skills Acquisition without rehearsal → wrong.

- H: Cognitive Preparation about correct cognitions → wrong.

So the question is which option is incorrect.

The question is multiple-choice, so only one option is correct as the answer.

Looking back, perhaps the intended answer is D. Because Skills Acquisition should include rehearsing, so D is wrong.

Alternatively, H is wrong because it's about correct cognitions hindering, which is incorrect.

So I'm a bit stuck, but perhaps D is the intended incorrect answer.

Wait, let me check the definitions again.

The correct steps:

Cognitive Preparation: Education about faulty cognitions and their impact.

Skills Acquisition: Learning and rehearsing new skills.

Practice: Applying skills in real situations, starting with easier ones.

So:

Option D says Skills Acquisition is learning without rehearsing → incorrect.

Option H says Cognitive Preparation is about correct cognitions → incorrect.

So the question is which is incorrect. Since both D and H are incorrect, but looking at the options, perhaps the intended answer is H.

Wait, no, the options are each separate, so the correct answer is the one that is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the actual mistake is in option H, because correct cognitions should help, not hinder. So H's definition is wrong.

So the answer would be H and D. But the options are single letters.

Wait, looking back, the question asks, which of the following steps is incorrectly defined.

So perhaps the answer is H.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The main issue is in the Skills Acquisition step.

In the correct SIT model, Skills Acquisition includes learning and rehearsing. So option F correctly describes it, while option D incorrectly describes it as learning without rehearsing.

So the incorrect step is D.

But H's definition is also incorrect.

Wait, but looking at the options, each is labeled as a step, so perhaps the question is about the step's definition.

So, for example, option H says COGNITION PREPARATION is about correct cognitions hindering. That's wrong because it's the faulty ones.

So the incorrect definition is H.

Wait, but the question is which is incorrectly defined by the therapist. So which option has the wrong definition.

So, the answer is either D or H.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D because Skills Acquisition does include rehearsing, so D is wrong.

Wait, but let's think: in the Skills Acquisition phase, do they just learn, or do they also rehearse?

Yes, the phase is Skills Acquisition and Rehearsal. So they learn and rehearse. So option D says "learning relaxation, self-statements... not necessary with rehearsing them." That's incorrect because rehearsal is part of the phase.

So option D is the incorrect definition.

Option H's definition is wrong, but perhaps the question is about the Skills Acquisition step.

So the answer would be D.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to list each option:

A: Skills Rehearsal: practice in real or imagined. Correct because rehearsal can involve imagined situations.

B: Practice: apply in controlled, non-threatening. Correct.

C: Cognition Prep: education on faulty. Correct.

D: Skills Acquisition: learn without rehearsing. Incorrect.

E: Practice: apply gradually. Correct.

F: Skills Acquisition: learn and rehearse. Correct.

G: Cognition Prep: identify and correct. Correct.

H: Cognition Prep: correct cognitions hinder. Incorrect.

So both D and H are incorrect. But the options are A to H, each being a possible answer.

The question asks which is incorrectly defined. So the correct answer is either D or H.

But the options only have one correct answer. So perhaps the intended answer is H.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the steps in SIT. Let me check the steps again.

The three main components:

1. Cognitive Preparation (Education): Understanding the role of cognition, identifying and challenging maladaptive thoughts.

2. Skills Acquisition and Rehearsal: Learning new skills and rehearsing them.

3. Application and Practice: Applying the skills in real-life situations, starting with less stressful.

So looking at the options, the incorrect definitions are:

Option D: Skills Acquisition without rehearsal → wrong.

Option H: Cognitive Prep about correct → wrong.

So perhaps both D and H are incorrect, but the options don't allow that.

Wait, the options are:

D: SKILLS ACQUISITION→ learning ... not necessary with rehearsing.

Which is incorrect because Skills Acquisition includes rehearsal.

H: COGNITION PREP→ understanding correct hindering, which is wrong.

So the incorrect definitions are D and H.

But the question is which is the incorrect step. Since the options are separate, perhaps the intended answer is H.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the steps, so the incorrect one is H because cognitive preparation shouldn't be about correct cognitions.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D because the therapist forgot that rehearsal is part of acquisition.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. But I think the intended answer is D because Skills Acquisition definitely includes rehearsing, so D's definition is wrong.

Stress Inoculation Training (SIT) is a cognitive-behavioral therapy that involves three main phases: (1) Cognitive Preparation, (2) Skills Acquisition and Rehearsal, and (3) Application and Practice. Each phase has specific goals and activities:

1. **Cognitive Preparation**: This phase educates clients about the role of cognition in stress and helps them identify and challenge maladaptive thoughts. Definitions that describe this phase correctly should focus on faulty cognitions and their impact on coping.

2. **Skills Acquisition and Rehearsal**: In this phase, clients learn new coping skills (e.g., relaxation, self-statements) and rehearse them, often in controlled or imagined situations. Rehearsal is an essential part of this phase.

3. **Application and Practice**: This phase involves applying the learned skills in real-life situations, starting with less stressful scenarios and gradually progressing to more challenging ones.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A**: Correct. Skills Rehearsal involves practicing newly acquired skills in real or imagined situations, which aligns with the Skills Acquisition and Rehearsal phase.
- **B**: Correct. Practice involves applying learned skills in controlled, non-threatening situations, which is part of the Application and Practice phase.
- **C**: Correct. Cognitive Preparation includes education on how faulty cognitions prevent adaptive coping.
- **D**: Incorrect. Skills Acquisition involves both learning new skills and rehearsing them. The statement that rehearsal is "not necessary" is inconsistent with the SIT model.
- **E**: Correct. Practice applies learning to real or imagined situations on a gradual basis, which is consistent with the Application and Practice phase.
- **F**: Correct. Skills Acquisition includes both learning and rehearsing new skills, making this definition accurate.
- **G**: Correct. Cognitive Preparation involves learning to identify and correct maladaptive thought patterns.
- **H**: Incorrect. Cognitive Preparation should focus on how faulty (maladaptive) cognitions hinder adaptive coping, not correct cognitions. This definition is flawed because correct cognitions should facilitate, not hinder, adaptive coping.

### Conclusion:
Both **D** and **H** are incorrectly defined. However, since the question asks for a single incorrect definition, **D** is the most clear-cut example because it directly contradicts the SIT model by stating that rehearsal is unnecessary in Skills Acquisition, whereas rehearsal is an integral part of this phase.
