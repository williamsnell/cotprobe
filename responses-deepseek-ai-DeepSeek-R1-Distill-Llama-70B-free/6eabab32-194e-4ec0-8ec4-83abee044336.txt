Okay, I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about behavioral therapy. The question asks how behavioral therapy typically alters the patterns of responding in clients. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that behavioral therapy is one of the branches of psychotherapy. I think it's based on the idea that behaviors are learned through experiences and interactions with the environment. So, the goal would be to change those learned behaviors that are causing problems.

Looking at the options, let me go through them one by one. Option A says "influencing patients by controlling the consequences of their actions." That sounds familiar. I recall something about operant conditioning, which uses reinforcement and punishment to change behavior. So if the consequences of actions are manipulated, like positive reinforcement for desired behavior, that could influence the client's actions. That makes sense for behavioral therapy.

Option B mentions focusing on dreams and the unconscious mind. That doesn't sound right for behavioral therapy. I think that's more aligned with psychoanalytic therapy, which Freud developed. So B is probably not the answer.

Option C talks about promoting insight into thoughts and feelings. That sounds more like cognitive therapy, which is part of CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy). But wait, the question is specifically about behavioral therapy, which I think focuses more on actions rather than thoughts. So C might not be correct.

Option D is about administering medication. That's a medical approach, probably handled by psychiatrists rather than behavioral therapy, which is usually conducted by psychologists or therapists. So D is likely incorrect.

Option E is about developing a positive self-image. That could be part of various therapies, maybe humanistic approaches like Rogers' person-centered therapy. Not sure if it's the core of behavioral therapy.

Option F refers to challenging illogical thinking. That definitely sounds like cognitive therapy again, where they challenge cognitive distortions. So F might not be the right choice for behavioral therapy.

Option G is about spiritual beliefs. I don't think that's a main focus of behavioral therapy. It might come up in some holistic approaches, but not typically in behavioral.

Option H is about repeating or rephrasing, which sounds like active listening techniques used in many therapies, maybe more in person-centered or supportive therapy. Not specific to behavioral.

Option I mentions past experiences and traumas. That's more like psychodynamic therapy or trauma-focused CBT, but again, behavioral therapy is more about current behavior patterns rather than past events.

So putting it all together, the key here is that behavioral therapy focuses on changing behavior through external factors. The most fitting option seems to be A, where the consequences of actions are controlled to influence behavior. Techniques like positive reinforcement, punishment, or extinction (removing a reinforcer) are part of this approach.

I think I'm confident that the answer is A.
</think>

Behavioral therapy focuses on altering behavior through external factors, specifically by manipulating the consequences of actions. This approach, rooted in operant conditioning, uses techniques like reinforcement and punishment to modify learned behaviors. Among the options provided, option A correctly captures this core principle of behavioral therapy.

Answer: A
