Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these calculations. But I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question gives me the standard enthalpy changes of formation (∆H°f) for several substances. The values are:

- CO2(g): 94.0 Kcal/mol
- CO(g): 26.4 Kcal/mol
- H2O(l): 68.4 Kcal/mol
- H2O(g): -57.8 Kcal/mol

Wait, wait. Hmm, the way the values are written, I think there might be a typo. The CO's value is written as 26,4 which I think is 26.4. And H2O(l) is 68.4, H2O(g) is -57.8. Oh wait, wait, wait. Wait, the standard enthalpy of formation for H2O(g) is negative? That seems odd because I remember that the formation of H2O is exothermic, so the ∆H°f should be negative. But wait, H2O(l) is 68.4? That's positive, which I'm a bit confused about. Because I thought the formation of water from elements is exothermic, so the ∆H°f would be negative. Hmm. Maybe I'm mixing up the values. Let me make sure.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of formation is the change when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So for H2O(l), if the value is positive 68.4, that would mean it's endothermic, which doesn't make sense. I'm probably remembering wrong. Maybe the numbers are correct, and I'm just getting confused. Let me proceed and check each part.

The problem has three reactions, and I need to find their heats of reaction (ΔH°rxn) using the given ∆H°f values. Then, I have to choose the correct set from the options A-J.

The three reactions are:

1. CO(g) + 1/2 O2(g) → CO2(g)
2. H2(g) + 1/2 O2(g) → H2O(l)
3. H2O(l) → H2O(g)

I think I should calculate each reaction's ΔH°rxn individually.

Starting with reaction (1):

CO(g) + ½ O2(g) → CO2(g)

The formula for ΔH°rxn is sum of ∆H°f of products minus sum of ∆H°f of reactants.

So, products: CO2(g) → 1 mole × 94.0 = 94.0 Kcal/mol.

Reactants: CO(g) is 26.4, O2(g) is in its standard state, so its ∆H°f is 0.

So ΔH°rxn1 = [94.0] - [26.4 + 0.5 × 0] → 94.0 -26.4 = 67.6 Kcal/mol. Wait, but wait, is that right? Because O2 is an element in standard form, so its ∆H°f is zero. So this calculation gives 67.6. But wait, the question is about heat of reaction, so if it's positive, the reaction is endothermic. But CO burning to CO2 is exothermic. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake. Because if CO is less stable than CO2, the reaction should release heat, so ΔH°rxn should be negative.

Wait, wait, maybe I mixed up products and reactants. Let me recheck: for the reaction aA + bB → cC + dD, ΔH°rxn = [c∆H°f(C) + d∆H°f(D)] – [a∆H°f(A) + b∆H°f(B)].

So in reaction 1, products are CO2 (ΔH°f 94), reactants are CO (26.4) and O2 (0).

So ΔH°rxn = (1×94) – (1×26.4 + 0.5×0) → 94 -26.4 = 67.6 Kcal/mol.

Wait, but that's positive, implying the reaction is endothermic, which doesn't make sense because CO is more reactive than CO2, and this reaction is combustion, which should be exothermic. So I'm confused. Did I get the signs wrong? Because maybe the given ∆H°f for CO is 26.4, which is higher than that of CO2 (94?), but wait, no, wait, CO2's ∆H°f is 94, which is higher than CO's 26.4. Wait, but higher ∆H°f means less stable, so the products would have higher enthalpy than reactants, making the reaction endothermic. But that's opposite of what I thought. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the values.

Wait, maybe the given values are not standard. Let me think again. Wait, no, the problem states that these are the ∆H°f values. Let me double-check the actual known values to see if I'm making a mistake. Wait, I think I might be confusing the sign conventions here. Normally, the standard enthalpy of formation for CO is about +26.4 Kcal/mol, and for CO2 it's around -94 Kcal/mol. Because formation of CO2 is exothermic. Wait, wait, that makes more sense. So perhaps the problem has a typo in the sign. Because as per my memory, CO2's ∆H°f is -94 Kcal/mol, not positive.

Wait, the problem states ∆H°_CO2(g) = 94.0. Hmm, maybe they're giving the enthalpy of combustion instead? Or perhaps it's a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong and the given values are correct. Let me proceed, assuming that the problem's values are correct, even if they seem counterintuitive.

So for reaction 1: CO + ½ O2 → CO2.

ΔH°rxn = [CO2's ∆H°f] – [CO's ∆H°f + (½ O2's ∆H°f)].

So that's 94.0 – (26.4 + 0) = 67.6 Kcal/mol. Positive, which would mean the reaction is endothermic, but that's impossible because burning CO should release heat. So either I'm making a mistake, or the problem's data is incorrect. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the enthalpy of decomposition instead of formation. Wait, but the way the question is phrased, it's the standard enthalpy of formation, so ∆H°f.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed despite this confusion, because maybe I'm missing something. Let's move on and see if the rest makes sense.

Reaction (2): H2(g) + ½ O2(g) → H2O(l)

ΔH°rxn2 = [H2O(l) ∆H°f] – [H2 and O2's ∆H°f]

H2 and O2 are elements in standard states, so their ∆H°f is zero.

So ΔH°rxn2 = 68.4 – (0 + 0) = 68.4 Kcal/mol.

Wait, but the formation of H2O from H2 and O2 is exothermic, so ΔH°rxn should be negative. So this suggests that the given ∆H°f for H2O(l) is positive 68.4, which can't be right. Because when H2 and O2 form H2O, heat is released, so the ∆H°rxn should be negative. Therefore, perhaps the given ∆H°f for H2O(l) is negative? But the problem says 68.4. Hmm, maybe the problem swapped the values for H2O(l) and H2O(g). Because I know that H2O(g) has a higher enthalpy than H2O(l), so its ∆H°f would be higher (more positive) than H2O(l). But in the problem, H2O(l) is 68.4 and H2O(g) is -57.8, which doesn't make sense. Because H2O(g) should have a higher (more positive) ∆H°f than H2O(l), not lower. So perhaps the problem has a typo, but I'll proceed with the given data, even if it seems contradictory.

So using the given data, ΔH°rxn2 would be 68.4 Kcal/mol, which is positive. That doesn't make sense, but I have to go with the given values.

Now reaction (3): H2O(l) → H2O(g)

This is the vaporization of water. The ΔH°rxn is the enthalpy change for this process.

The formula is: products are H2O(g), reactants are H2O(l).

So ΔH°rxn3 = [H2O(g) ∆H°f] – [H2O(l) ∆H°f]

Which is (-57.8) – (68.4) = -57.8 -68.4 = -126.2 Kcal/mol.

Wait, but that can't be right because vaporization is endothermic, so ΔH°rxn should be positive. So this suggests I'm doing something wrong here.

Wait, no, wait, because the standard enthalpy of formation for H2O(g) is -57.8, and for H2O(l) is 68.4. So when H2O(l) turns into H2O(g), the ΔH°rxn is [H2O(g) ∆H°f] - [H2O(l) ∆H°f] = (-57.8) - (68.4) = -126.2 Kcal/mol. But that's negative, implying the process releases heat, which is wrong because vaporization absorbs heat. So something's wrong here. Either the problem's data is incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, maybe I have the signs reversed. Let me think: the standard enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy change when a compound is formed from elements. So if H2O(l) has a ∆H°f of 68.4, that means forming it from H2 and O2 releases heat? No, wait, no. Wait, the ∆H°f is the enthalpy change when one mole is formed from elements. If the value is positive, it means the process is endothermic. But when H2 and O2 form H2O, it's exothermic, so the ∆H°f should be negative. So the given values must be wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using different conventions, but that's unlikely.

I'm getting stuck here. Let's try to proceed, perhaps I'll find a way through.

So, to recap:

Reaction 1: CO + ½ O2 → CO2

ΔH°rxn1 = 94.0 - 26.4 = 67.6 Kcal/mol (positive, which doesn't make sense)

Reaction 2: H2 + ½ O2 → H2O(l)

ΔH°rxn2 = 68.4 - 0 = 68.4 Kcal/mol (positive again, which is wrong)

Reaction 3: H2O(l) → H2O(g)

ΔH°rxn3 = (-57.8) - 68.4 = -126.2 Kcal/mol (negative, which is wrong)

Hmm. The calculated values don't make sense because they contradict what I know about the reactions. So perhaps I made a mistake in how I'm applying the formula.

Wait a minute! Oh no, I think I see the mistake. The formula is:

ΔH°rxn = Σ (ΔH°f products) - Σ (ΔH°f reactants)

But wait, in reaction (3), H2O(l) is the reactant, and H2O(g) is the product. So the correct calculation is:

ΔH°rxn3 = [H2O(g)] - [H2O(l)] = (-57.8) - (68.4) = -126.2 Kcal/mol.

But that's negative, which as I thought earlier, doesn't make sense because vaporization requires heat. So positive ΔH°rxn would mean endothermic.

Wait, maybe the problem's given values are incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong signs for the ∆H°f values. Let me check: ∆H°f for elements in their standard state is zero. For compounds, it's the heat released or absorbed when formed from elements. So if a compound's ∆H°f is positive, it means forming it from elements requires heat (endothermic). If negative, it's exothermic.

Wait, let's see the known standard enthalpies of formation:

- CO2(g): ∆H°f = -393.5 kJ/mol, which is about -94 Kcal/mol (since 1 Kcal = 4.184 kJ, so 393.5/4.184 ≈94). So the problem states CO2 is 94.0, but in reality it's -94. So the problem must have the signs wrong.

Similarly, CO(g) has ∆H°f about -110.5 kJ/mol, which is around -26.4 Kcal/mol. So the problem says CO is 26.4, which is positive, opposite of reality.

H2O(l): known ∆H°f is about -285.8 kJ/mol → around -68.4 Kcal/mol. So the problem says 68.4, which is positive, wrong again.

H2O(g): known ∆H°f is about -241.8 kJ/mol → around -57.8 Kcal/mol. So the problem correctly gives it as -57.8.

So, the problem's given values for CO2, CO, and H2O(l) are incorrectly positive. Only H2O(g) is correct.

So, perhaps I need to correct the given values before proceeding.

So, using the correct signs:

CO2(g): ∆H°f = -94.0 Kcal/mol

CO(g): ∆H°f = -26.4 Kcal/mol

H2O(l): ∆H°f = -68.4 Kcal/mol

H2O(g): ∆H°f = -57.8 Kcal/mol

Wait, but the problem gives them as positive, so maybe I should adjust the calculations accordingly.

But if I proceed with the problem's given values, the answers would be way off. So perhaps the problem intended to provide the correct signs, but there was a typo. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the enthalpy of combustion, not the standard enthalpy of formation. But no, the question clearly states ∆H°_CO2(g) etc., which refers to formation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using enthalpy of reaction as the enthalpy change when a compound decomposes into elements, which would be the negative of the standard enthalpy of formation. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's try recalculating using the correct signs, ignoring the problem's given signs, to see if it makes sense. Because otherwise, the answers don't make sense.

Using the correct signs:

Reaction 1: CO + ½ O2 → CO2

ΔH°rxn1 = [CO2's ∆H°f] – [CO's ∆H°f + ½ O2's ∆H°f]

Which is [(-94.0)] – [(-26.4) + 0] = (-94.0) - (-26.4) = (-94.0 +26.4) = -67.6 Kcal/mol.

That makes sense because it's exothermic.

Reaction 2: H2 + ½ O2 → H2O(l)

ΔH°rxn2 = [H2O(l) ∆H°f] – [H2 and O2's ∆H°f] = (-68.4) - (0 + 0) = -68.4 Kcal/mol.

Which makes sense, exothermic.

Reaction 3: H2O(l) → H2O(g)

ΔH°rxn3 = [H2O(g) ∆H°f] – [H2O(l) ∆H°f] = (-57.8) - (-68.4) = (-57.8 +68.4) = +10.6 Kcal/mol.

Ah, that's positive, which makes sense because vaporization requires heat.

So, with the correct signs, the ΔH°rxn for the three reactions are:

1. -67.6 Kcal/mol

2. -68.4 Kcal/mol

3. +10.6 Kcal/mol

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches.

Option C: -67.6, -68.4, +10.6 → yes, that matches.

Option I: -67.6, +10.6, -68.4 → no, because the third value is wrong.

So the correct answer would be option C.

To determine the heats of reaction for the given reactions, we use the standard enthalpies of formation (∆H°f) provided:

- **CO2(g):** 94.0 Kcal/mol  
- **CO(g):** 26.4 Kcal/mol  
- **H2O(l):** 68.4 Kcal/mol  
- **H2O(g):** -57.8 Kcal/mol  

### Reaction (1): CO(g) + ½ O2(g) → CO2(g)  
The heat of reaction is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta H^\circ_{\text{rxn}} = \Delta H^\circ_f(\text{CO}_2) - \left[\Delta H^\circ_f(\text{CO}) + \frac{1}{2} \Delta H^\circ_f(\text{O}_2)\right]
\]  
Since O2 is in its standard state, its ∆H°f = 0. Substituting the values:  
\[
\Delta H^\circ_{\text{rxn}} = 94.0 - (26.4 + 0) = 67.6 \, \text{Kcal/mol}.
\]  
However, this result is inconsistent with the fact that the reaction is exothermic. Upon reviewing, it is clear the problem's ∆H°
