Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence question. Let's see... The scenario is about a man who's suing a grocery store because he fell while restocking shelves. He claims the accident caused him back and leg pain. His tennis partner, a woman, testified that five days before the accident, he told her he couldn't finish a tennis match because of back and leg pains.

The question is about whether this testimony is admissible and under what rule. The options are from A to J, each giving different reasons.

First, I remember that in evidence law, statements about a person's physical condition can sometimes be admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, which is generally inadmissible unless there's an exception.

The woman's testimony is about what the man said about his pain before the accident. So, the statement is being offered to show that the man had back and leg pain before the accident, which would undermine his claim that the accident caused his current pain. That's probably relevant because it goes to the issue of whether the accident was the cause of his injuries.

Now, the key is whether this statement falls under a hearsay exception. I recall that statements about a person's current physical condition are admissible under the "statement of physical condition" exception. Specifically, Federal Rule of Evidence 803(3) allows for statements showing the declarant's then-existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition, including intent, plan, motive, or other mental state but not including statements of memory or belief unless they relate to the execution, revocation, identification, or terms of an agreement.

In this case, the man's statement about his back and leg pain was made five days before the accident. So it's a statement about his physical condition at that time. Therefore, it should be admissible as an exception to hearsay under the physical condition exception.

Wait, but some might argue that the statement is too old. However, five days before the accident is relatively close in time, so it's likely to be considered contemporaneous enough to fall under the exception.

Looking at the options, option D says "admissible as a statement of physical condition." Option F is similar, "admissible as a statement of bodily condition." I think both might be correct, but let me think. The terms are almost the same, but perhaps the correct exception is called "statement of physical condition," which would be option D.

Alternatively, sometimes it's referred to as a "bodily condition." But I think the more precise term in the rules is "physical condition," so option D might be the right choice.

Wait, let me double-check. The options are D and F. The actual rule is 803(3), which includes "physical condition." So the correct option would be D.

But wait, another thought: Is this statement being used to prove he had pain before, which would affect his claim that the accident caused it. So it's relevant and not hearsay because it's covered by the exception.

Alternatively, could it be inadmissible for another reason? Maybe the woman's testimony is about a statement made by the man, but that's exactly the kind of statement the exception covers.

So, putting it all together, the testimony should be admissible as a statement of physical condition, making option D or F correct. I think the correct answer is D because "statement of physical condition" is the exact term used in the rule.

The man's statement to his tennis partner about his back and leg pain, made five days before the accident, is being offered to show that he had physical discomfort before the incident, which could undermine his claim that the accident caused his injuries. This statement qualifies as an exception to the hearsay rule under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(3), which allows statements about a declarant's then-existing physical condition. The statement is relevant and admissible because it pertains to the man's physical state at the time it was made, making it a "statement of physical condition."

The correct answer is **D: admissible as a statement of physical condition.**

Answer: D
