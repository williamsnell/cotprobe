Okay, so I've got this question about personnel selection, and I'm trying to figure out the correct answer. The question is about the definition of the selection ratio. Hmm, I remember a bit about this from my psychology class, but I'm a little fuzzy on the details.

Let me start by recalling what selection ratio means. I think it's a term used in industrial psychology, specifically in the context of hiring processes. Selection ratio probably has something to do with the number of people selected compared to the number of applicants. 

The options are A through D. Let me go through each one.

Option A says it's the ratio of successful to unsuccessful workers. Wait, that sounds more like a measure of job performance, not selection. Like, if a company has a lot of successful workers versus those who didn't do well, but that's after hiring. So selection ratio might be before that.

Option B is the ratio of successful selected workers to the difficulty level of the job. Hmm, that doesn't quite make sense. The difficulty of the job is a separate factor, like how hard the job is, but selection ratio is probably a numerical measure involving counts, not a comparison to a qualitative aspect like difficulty.

Option C is the percent of workers correctly placed in the group hired. That sounds more like a measure of placement accuracy or perhaps validity of the selection method. Like, if they used a test and it correctly predicted who would do well, that's about placement, not the ratio of selection.

Option D is the ratio of the number of workers needed to the number of applicants available. Oh, wait, that makes sense. So selection ratio would be how many positions are open (needed) compared to how many people applied. Like, if they need 10 workers and 100 applied, the selection ratio is 10:100 or 10%. That seems right. I remember that the selection ratio is about the proportion of applicants who are selected. It's an important factor because a higher ratio (more selected) might mean lower selection standards, while a lower ratio (fewer selected) could mean higher standards.

Wait, but sometimes the selection ratio is defined as the number selected divided by the number of applicants. So like, if 10 are selected out of 100, the ratio is 0.1 or 10%. That's what option D is sayingâ€”the workers needed (selected) over applicants available. So D seems correct.

I think option A is about success after selection, which is more about performance, not the selection process itself. So the answer should be D.

The selection ratio in personnel selection refers to the proportion of applicants who are selected for the available positions. It is calculated as the number of workers needed divided by the number of applicants available. This measure is important because it indicates the competitiveness of the hiring process and can influence the standards applied during selection.

- **Option A**: Refers to successful versus unsuccessful workers, which pertains to post-hiring performance, not the selection process.
- **Option B**: Compares successful workers to job difficulty, which mixes selection with an unrelated factor (job difficulty).
- **Option C**: Focuses on placement accuracy, which is about the validity of the selection method, not the ratio of selection.
- **Option D**: Correctly defines the selection ratio as the number of workers needed divided by the number of applicants, aligning with the concept of selection ratio.

Answer: D
