Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about strings and their frequencies. I remember that this has to do with wave properties and maybe some formulas involving tension, mass, and length. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem says there are two strings, both 100 centimeters long. The first string has a mass of 4 grams and emits a frequency of 250 vibrations per second. The second string has a mass of 1 gram, and we need to find its frequency when under the same tension as the first string.

I think the key formula here is the one that relates frequency to the properties of the string. I remember that the frequency of a vibrating string depends on the tension, the length, and the mass per unit length. Oh right, the formula is f = (1/(2L)) * sqrt(T/μ), where f is frequency, L is length, T is tension, and μ is the linear mass density (mass per unit length).

Wait, linear mass density μ is mass divided by length. So for each string, μ = mass / length. But wait, the lengths are the same for both strings, 100 cm which is 1 meter. So for the first string, μ1 = 4 grams / 1 m. But wait, units might matter here. Oh, grams are in the CGS system, so maybe I should convert to kilograms or use appropriate units. Hmm, but since both strings have the same length, maybe the units will cancel out when taking the ratio.

The tension T is the same for both strings, so when taking the ratio of the frequencies, T will cancel out. That's helpful.

Let me write down the frequencies for both strings using the formula.

For string 1: f1 = 250 Hz = (1/(2*1)) * sqrt(T/μ1)
For string 2: f2 = ? = (1/(2*1)) * sqrt(T/μ2)

So we can write f1 = (1/2) * sqrt(T/μ1)
And f2 = (1/2) * sqrt(T/μ2)

If I take the ratio f2/f1, the (1/2) terms cancel out.

So f2/f1 = sqrt( (T/μ2) / (T/μ1) ) )
Simplify inside the square root: (T/μ2) * (μ1 / T) ) = μ1 / μ2

So f2/f1 = sqrt( μ1 / μ2 )

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me redo that.

Wait, the ratio is sqrt( (T/μ2) / (T/μ1) ) ) = sqrt( (T * μ1) / (μ2 * T) ) ) = sqrt( μ1 / μ2 )

So f2/f1 = sqrt( μ1 / μ2 )

Wait, but μ is mass per length. Since the length is same, μ is proportional to mass. So μ1 = 4 grams, μ2 = 1 gram.

Because both have the same length, so μ is just mass divided by 1m, so for string 1 μ1=4g/m, string 2 μ2=1g/m.

So plugging in μ1=4 and μ2=1:

f2/f1 = sqrt(4/1) = sqrt(4) = 2.

So f2 = 2 * f1.

But wait, wait. Because f2/f1 is 2, so f2 = 2 * 250 = 500 Hz.

Wait, but that would give 500 Hz, which is option E. But let me double-check the formula because I might have mixed up the ratio.

Wait, let me rederive the frequency formula correctly. The frequency of a vibrating string is given by f = (1/(2L)) * sqrt(T/μ). So the formula is correct.

So for string 1, f1 = (1/(2L)) * sqrt(T/μ1)
String 2, f2 = (1/(2L)) * sqrt(T/μ2)

So f2/f1 = sqrt( (T/μ2) / (T/μ1) ) ) = sqrt(μ1 / μ2 )

So since μ1 is 4g/m and μ2 is 1g/m, μ1/μ2 is 4/1 =4. So sqrt(4) is 2. So f2 = 2*f1 = 2*250=500 Hz. So the answer should be E:500vps.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me think again because sometimes I get confused with inverse relations. Because higher mass would lead to lower frequency because it's harder to vibrate faster. So string 2 has lower mass (1g vs 4g). So it should vibrate faster, higher frequency. So if string 1 is 250, string 2 should be higher than that.

Wait, this contradicts my earlier conclusion. Because if string 2 has lower mass, μ is smaller, so sqrt(μ1/μ2) would be sqrt(4/1)=2, so f2 = 2*f1.

Wait, that would make f2=500, which is higher than 250, which makes sense because lower mass should mean higher frequency.

Wait, but in my initial calculation, I thought f2/f1 is 2. So f2=500. But in that case, answer E is 500, which is higher than 250, correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 500vps. So that should be the correct answer.

Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't flip the ratio. Let's recast the problem.

Another approach: since f is proportional to 1/sqrt(μ), because f = (1/(2L)) * sqrt(T/μ). So f proportional to 1/sqrt(μ) when T and L are constant.

So f2 = f1 * sqrt( μ1 / μ2 )

Because μ1 is 4, μ2 is 1.

So f2 = 250 * sqrt(4/1) = 250 * 2 =500 Hz.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer is E:500vps.

To solve the problem, we use the formula for the frequency of a vibrating string:

\[
f = \frac{1}{2L} \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}
\]

where \( f \) is the frequency, \( L \) is the length of the string, \( T \) is the tension, and \( \mu \) is the linear mass density (mass per unit length). Since both strings have the same length and are under the same tension, the ratio of their frequencies depends only on the ratio of their linear mass densities:

\[
\frac{f_2}{f_1} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu_1}{\mu_2}}
\]

The linear mass density \( \mu \) is given by \( \mu = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{length}} \). For the first string, \( \mu_1 = \frac{4 \, \text{g}}{1 \, \text{m}} = 4 \, \text{g/m} \), and for the second string, \( \mu_2 = \frac{1 \, \text{g}}{1 \, \text{m}} = 1 \, \text{g/m} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{f_2}{f_1} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu_1}{\mu_2}} = \sqrt{\frac{4}{1}} = 2
\]

Thus, \( f_2 = 2 \cdot f_1 \). Given \( f_1 = 250 \, \text{vps} \), we find:

\[
f_2 = 2 \cdot 250 = 500 \, \text{vps}
\]

This result makes sense because the second string has a lower mass, leading to a higher frequency. The correct answer is:

**E: 500vps**
