To compute the line integrals \(\int_K xy \, dx\) and \(\int_L xy \, dx\), we proceed as follows:

---

### For the straight line \(K\) from \((0,0)\) to \((1,1)\):

1. **Parameterize the curve**:  
   Since \(K\) is a straight line, we can parameterize it as:  
   \[
   x = t, \quad y = t, \quad t \in [0,1].
   \]

2. **Compute \(dx\)**:  
   Differentiating \(x = t\) gives \(dx = dt\).

3. **Substitute into the integral**:  
   \[
   \int_K xy \, dx = \int_0^1 t \cdot t \cdot dt = \int_0^1 t^2 \, dt.
   \]

4. **Evaluate the integral**:  
   \[
   \int_0^1 t^2 \, dt = \left[\frac{t^3}{3}\right]_0^1 = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.333.
   \]

---

### For the parabola \(L\) from \((0,0)\) to \((1,1)\):

1. **Parameterize the curve**:  
   The parabola is given by \(y = x^2\). We can parameterize it as:  
   \[
   x = t, \quad y = t^2, \quad t \in [0,1].
   \]

2. **Compute \(dx\)**:  
   Differentiating \(x = t\) gives \(dx = dt\).

3. **Substitute into the integral**:  
   \[
   \int_L xy \, dx = \int_0^1 t \cdot t^2 \cdot dt = \int_0^1 t^3 \, dt.
   \]

4. **Evaluate the integral**:  
   \[
   \int_0^1 t^3 \, dt = \left[\frac{t^4}{4}\right]_0^1 = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25.
   \]

---

### Final Answer:
The computed values of the line integrals are approximately \([0.333, 0.25]\).

Looking at the options provided, the closest match is **I: [0.333, 0.25]**.

**Answer:** I
