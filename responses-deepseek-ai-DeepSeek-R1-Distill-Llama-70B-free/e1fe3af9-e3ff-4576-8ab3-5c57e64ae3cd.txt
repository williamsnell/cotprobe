Question:

In June a computer retailer ordered 100 computers, with various configurations, from a manufacturer, to be delivered by August 1. The order form expressly limited acceptance to the terms of the offer. In July the manufacturer sent a confirmation agreeing to the terms and specifications, but stating that "shipment will be made in two deliveries, half by August 10 and the other half by August 20." When shipment was not made by August 1, the retailer withdrew the order. Will the manufacturer prevail in enforcing a contract?

Options:

A: No, because the order was withdrawn before the machines were shipped.
B: Yes, because the manufacturer sent a confirmation agreeing to the terms and specifications.
C: Yes, because there was only a minimal difference between the offer and acceptance.
D: No, because the manufacturer failed to deliver on the agreed date.
E: Yes, because the order was not officially canceled by the retailer.
F: No, because the offer expressly limited the acceptance to the terms of the offer.
G: No, because the manufacturer changed the terms without the retailer's explicit consent.
H: Yes, because the retailer assented to the terms by remaining silent until after August 1.
I: Yes, because the manufacturer had the right to change the delivery dates.
J: No, because the retailer has the right to withdraw the order at any time before shipment.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this contracts question. Let me read through it again. 

In June, a computer retailer ordered 100 computers from a manufacturer, to be delivered by August 1. The order form said that acceptance was limited to the terms of the offer. So the retailer's offer had specific terms, and they made it clear that any acceptance must stick to those terms.

Then in July, the manufacturer sent a confirmation. They agreed to the terms and specs, but added that shipment would be in two parts: half by August 10 and half by August 20. So the delivery date changed from August 1 to later dates.

When the shipment wasn't made by August 1, the retailer withdrew the order. Now, the question is whether the manufacturer can enforce the contract.

Hmm, I remember something about the "mailbox rule" and how offers and acceptances work. Also, the concept of firms offers versus standard offers. Oh wait, and the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) might come into play here because this is a sale of goods.

So the retailer sent an offer with specific terms, including delivery by August 1. The manufacturer's response was a confirmation but changed the delivery date. Under common law, if an acceptance changes the terms, it's considered a counteroffer, right? Because the original offer was limited to its terms. So the manufacturer's response might not be an acceptance but a counteroffer.

Wait, but under the UCC, there's something called the "firm offer" rule. If the offer is by a merchant and it's for goods, and it's made in a signed writing, it can be irrevocable for a certain period, like up to three months. But here, the order was made in June, and the confirmation in July. Not sure if the offer was a firm offer. The question says the order form "expressly limited acceptance to the terms of the offer," which might mean it's a firm offer, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, under the UCC, even if the acceptance varies some terms, like delivery date, it might still be considered an acceptance if the changes are not material. But wait, the original offer was strict about the terms. The order form said acceptance was limited to those terms, so any deviation might not be acceptable.

So when the manufacturer sent their confirmation, by changing the delivery date, they might have made a counteroffer. The retailer's offer required delivery by August 1, and the manufacturer said they'd deliver later. So the manufacturer's response would be a counteroffer, and unless the retailer accepted that, there's no contract.

Wait, but when the manufacturer sent the confirmation, did they propose new terms? If so, the retailer could have either accepted those new terms or not. Since the retailer didn't agree, and then withdrew the order when the shipment wasn't made, maybe there was no contract formed because the manufacturer didn't accept the original offer as is.

Another angle: if the manufacturer's response was an acceptance with additional terms. Under UCC 2-207, additional terms become part of the contract unless they're objected to. But wait, 2-207 applies when both parties are merchants, which they are here. So if the manufacturer's confirmation added a term about delivery in two parts, that would be an additional term. Unless the offer expressly limited acceptance, which it did, then the additional terms wouldn't be part of the contract. So the manufacturer's attempt to add terms might not be effective, making their response not an acceptance but a counter.

So if the manufacturer didn't accept the original offer, there's no contract yet. Therefore, when the retailer withdrew the offer before shipment, the manufacturer can't enforce the contract.

Looking at the options:

Option A: No, because the order was withdrawn before shipment. That could be, but the issue is whether a contract was formed before withdrawal.

Option F: No, because the offer limited acceptance to its terms. So the manufacturer's response didn't accept on those terms, so no contract. So the retailer can withdraw.

Option G: No, because manufacturer changed terms without consent. That sounds right too, but I think F is more precise because it's about the express limitation.

Option J: No, because the retailer can withdraw before shipment. But whether a contract exists is the key. If no contract, they can withdraw.

Wait, so if the manufacturer's confirmation was a counteroffer, then no contract was formed. So the retailer's withdrawal would effectively just end the negotiations. So the manufacturer can't enforce a contract because there wasn't one.

So the correct answer would be either F or G or J.

Option F says No because the offer limited acceptance, so the manufacturer didn't accept as per the terms. So the manufacturer's response was a counteroffer, and no contract was formed. So the retailer can withdraw.

Alternatively, Option G says No because the manufacturer changed terms without consent. That's also correct, but I think the key is that the offer limited acceptance, so the manufacturer's response wasn't an acceptance.

So the answer should be F.

Wait, but in the UCC, even if the offer says it's limited to its terms, when the manufacturer sends an acceptance that proposes different terms, under 2-207, the additional terms are considered unless objected. But wait, 2-207 says that when an acceptance is on different terms, it's treated as a counteroffer unless the offeror specifies otherwise. But the offer here limited acceptance, so maybe the manufacturer's response was a counteroffer.

Alternatively, if the offer was a firm offer under UCC 2-205, then it's irrevocable, but I don't think that applies here because the offer was made in June, and the manufacturer responded in July, but the offer was to deliver in August. I'm not sure if the firm offer applies because the offer was without consideration.

Alternatively, the order was an offer, and the manufacturer's response was an acceptance, but with varying terms. Under common law, varying terms in acceptance makes it a counteroffer. So the original offer was still open, and the manufacturer's response didn't accept it. So when the retailer withdrew, there was no contract.

So the manufacturer can't enforce a contract because no contract was formed. So the answer would be F.

The question revolves around whether a contract was formed between the retailer and the manufacturer. The retailer sent an offer in June with specific terms, including delivery by August 1, and explicitly stated that acceptance was limited to those terms. The manufacturer responded in July with a confirmation agreeing to the terms and specifications but proposed a different delivery scheduleâ€”half by August 10 and half by August 20. This response altered the delivery date, which was a material term of the original offer.

Under common law, an acceptance that alters the terms of an offer is considered a counteroffer rather than an acceptance. The retailer's offer expressly limited acceptance to its terms, so the manufacturer's response did not constitute an acceptance. Instead, it was a counteroffer, which the retailer did not accept. As a result, no contract was formed between the parties.

When the retailer withdrew the order before shipment, there was no existing contract to enforce. The manufacturer's attempt to modify the delivery terms without the retailer's consent meant that the original offer was never properly accepted. Therefore, the manufacturer cannot enforce a contract because no contract was ever formed.

The correct answer is **F: No, because the offer expressly limited acceptance to the terms of the offer.**

Answer: F
