Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this question: As of 2015, what percentage of the global population over 15 years old was literate? The options are from A to J, with various percentages.

First, I should recall what I know about literacy rates. I remember that global literacy rates have been improving over time. I think that as of a few years ago, the majority of the world's population is literate, but I'm not sure of the exact percentage.

I recall that UNESCO and other organizations track these statistics. From what I remember, the global adult literacy rate was around 86% or so. Wait, but I might be mixing it up with other statistics. Let me think more carefully.

I think that in 2015, the literacy rate for people aged 15 and older was about 86%. That would correspond to option I. But wait, sometimes these numbers can vary based on the source or the year. I should make sure I'm not confusing it with data from a different year.

Wait, another thought: sometimes the numbers are higher because they include younger populations. Oh, but the question specifically mentions over 15 years old, so that's adults. I think the global adult literacy rate was around 86% in 2015. So looking at the options, option I is 86%.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I remember that some regions have much lower rates, like parts of Africa and South Asia, while others are near 100%. So the global average would be somewhere in the mid-80s. That would make sense.

Alternatively, maybe it's higher. I think in the mid-2000s, the rate was about 84%, so by 2015, it might have gone up a couple of points, maybe 86%. That would fit.

So looking at the options, option I is 86%, which I think is the correct answer. So I'll go with I.

As of 2015, the global literacy rate for individuals over 15 years old was approximately 86%. This aligns with option I.
