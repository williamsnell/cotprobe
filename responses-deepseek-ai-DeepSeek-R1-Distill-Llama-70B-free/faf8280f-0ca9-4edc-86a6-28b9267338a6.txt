Okay, so I have this problem about noise bandwidth, and I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what I remember.

The question gives me the power transfer function |H(ω)|² = 1 / [1 + (ω/B)²]. I need to find the noise bandwidth B_N, and B is the 3-dB bandwidth in radians per second.

Hmm, I remember that noise bandwidth is related to the integral of the power transfer function over all frequencies. Oh right, the formula for noise bandwidth is the integral from 0 to infinity of |H(ω)|² dω divided by the maximum value of |H(ω)|². Wait, or is it just the integral of |H(ω)|² from -infinity to infinity divided by the maximum? Or perhaps specifically over positive frequencies only. I think for noise bandwidth, it's the integral from 0 to infinity.

Wait, no, noise bandwidth is often defined as the width of a rectangular filter that would pass the same amount of noise. The formula I recall is B_N = (1 / H_max²) * ∫[from 0 to ∞] |H(ω)|² dω. Or maybe H_max is 1, since in this case |H(0)|² is 1 when ω=0.

So in this case, since |H(0)|² is 1, H_max is 1. Therefore, B_N would just be the integral of |H(ω)|² from 0 to ∞.

So let me write that down. B_N = ∫[0 to ∞] |H(ω)|² dω. And |H(ω)|² is [1 / (1 + (ω/B)^2)].

So the integral becomes ∫[0 to ∞] [1 / (1 + (ω/B)^2)] dω.

Wait, this integral looks familiar. It's similar to the arctangent integral. Let me make a substitution to solve it. Let me set x = ω/B. Then ω = B x, and dω = B dx. So the integral becomes ∫[x=0 to ∞] [1 / (1 + x²)] * B dx. Because substituting, the denominator becomes 1 + x², and dω is B dx.

So the integral is B * ∫[0 to ∞] 1/(1 + x²) dx. I know that the integral of 1/(1+x²) dx from 0 to ∞ is π/2. Because ∫[0,∞] 1/(1+x²) dx = [arctan(x)] from 0 to ∞, which is π/2 - 0 = π/2.

So the integral becomes B * (π/2). Therefore, B_N = B * (π/2).

Wait, but wait, what's B? B is the 3-dB bandwidth. The 3-dB bandwidth of a system is the frequency at which the power is half the maximum power. So for this transfer function, when ω = B, |H(ω)|² becomes 1/(1 + 1) = 0.5, so that fits.

So B_N is (π/2) times B. Let me calculate π/2. Pi is approximately 3.1416, so pi/2 is about 1.5708. So B_N is approximately 1.57 times B. Wait, but looking at the options, option C says B_N is 1.57 times larger than the 3-dB bandwidth. So that would be correct.

But wait, I should double-check the definition of noise bandwidth. The noise bandwidth is the width of a rectangular filter with the same gain, which in the case of a rectangular filter is just the bandwidth because the transfer function is flat. The formula for noise bandwidth in general is:

B_N = (1 / |H_max|^2) * ∫[0 to ∞] |H(ω)|^2 dω.

Since |H_max|^2 is 1 here, B_N is just the integral, which we found to be (π/2) B. So yeah, B_N is (π/2) * B, which is approximately 1.57 times B.

Looking at the options:

Option C: B_N is 1.57 times larger than the system 3-dB bandwidth. That matches.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Oh wait, another thing. Sometimes definitions vary whether the integral is from -infinity to infinity or just 0 to infinity. Oh wait, in my calculation I did 0 to infinity, but for some definitions, especially in two-sided spectra, the noise bandwidth is defined as the integral from -infty to infty divided by the maximum. But in that case, the integral from -infty to infty of |H(ω)|² would be 2*(π/2)*B = π B. So B_N would be π B / 1 = π B. But that's if we consider both positive and negative frequencies. However, in the context of noise bandwidth, which is typically a single-sided bandwidth (since noise is considered over positive frequencies), the integral is from 0 to infty.

Wait, I'm a bit confused now. Let me clarify. The noise bandwidth is often defined for a low-pass filter as the integral from 0 to infinity of |H(ω)|² dω. So in that case, our calculation is correct, giving B_N = (π/2) B.

So the correct answer would be option C.

To determine the noise bandwidth \( B_N \) of the system, we start with the given power transfer function:

\[
|H(\omega)|^2 = \frac{1}{1 + \left(\frac{\omega}{B}\right)^2},
\]

where \( B \) is the 3-dB bandwidth. The noise bandwidth is defined as:

\[
B_N = \int_{0}^{\infty} |H(\omega)|^2 \, d\omega.
\]

Substituting \( |H(\omega)|^2 \) into the integral:

\[
B_N = \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{1 + \left(\frac{\omega}{B}\right)^2} \, d\omega.
\]

To simplify, let \( x = \frac{\omega}{B} \), so \( \omega = Bx \) and \( d\omega = B \, dx \). The integral becomes:

\[
B_N = \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{1 + x^2} \, B \, dx = B \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{1 + x^2} \, dx.
\]

The integral \( \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{1 + x^2} \, dx \) is a standard result and equals \( \frac{\pi}{2} \). Therefore:

\[
B_N = B \cdot \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

Since \( \pi/2 \approx 1.57 \), this implies:

\[
B_N \approx 1.57 \cdot B.
\]

Thus, the noise bandwidth \( B_N \) is approximately 1.57 times larger than the 3-dB bandwidth \( B \).
