Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to calculate the spin angular momentum of 43Ca, and the given I is 7/2. Hmm, I remember that angular momentum has something to do with quantum numbers and the Planck constant. Oh right, I think the formula involves the square root of (I(I+1)) multiplied by some constant.

Wait, what's the exact formula again? Oh yeah, the formula for the spin angular momentum is S = ħ * sqrt(I(I+1)), where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. I remember that ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Right, so I need to plug in I = 7/2 into this equation.

Let me break it down. I is 7/2, so I+1 would be 9/2. Multiplying I and I+1: (7/2)*(9/2) = 63/4. So sqrt(63/4). Wait, 63 divided by 4 is 15.75, but let me calculate the square root. Oh wait, sqrt(63) is a bit tricky. 7^2 is 49, 8^2 is 64, so sqrt(63) is approximately 7.937. Wait no, wait, 7.937 squared is around 63. Let me think: 7.9^2 is 62.41, 7.93^2 is (7.9)^2 + 2*7.9*0.03 + 0.03^2 = 62.41 + 0.474 + 0.0009 = 62.8849. Hmm, not enough. 7.94^2 is 7.9^2 + 2*7.9*0.04 + 0.04^2 = 62.41 + 0.632 + 0.0016 = 63.0436. Oh, so sqrt(63) is between 7.94 and 7.93. Wait, maybe it's better to compute it more accurately, but perhaps for the sake of this problem, using an approximate value is okay.

Wait wait, no. Wait, the calculation is sqrt(I(I+1)), which is sqrt( (7/2)(9/2) ) which is sqrt(63/4). Because (7/2)(9/2) is 63/4. So sqrt(63/4) is the same as sqrt(63)/2. So sqrt(63)= approximately 7.937. So 7.937 divided by 2 is about 3.9685.

But let me think again. Maybe I can calculate 63/4 first. 63 divided by 4 is 15.75. So sqrt(15.75). Hmm, sqrt(16) is 4, so sqrt(15.75) is just a bit less. Let me calculate 3.968 squared: 3.968^2 is approximately (4 - 0.032)^2 = 16 - 2*4*0.032 + 0.032^2 = 16 - 0.256 + 0.001024 ≈ 15.745. Oh, that's close to 15.75. So sqrt(15.75) is approximately 3.9685.

So the square root part is about 3.9685. Then I multiply by ħ, which is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So 3.9685 * 1.0545718e-34. Let me compute that. Let me compute 4e-34 * 1.0545718 is 4.218e-34, but since it's 3.9685, which is about 0.0315 less than 4, I need to subtract that part. 0.0315 * 1.0545718e-34. 0.0315 * 1 is 0.0315, so 0.0315 * 1.0545718 is approximately 0.0332. So 4.218e-34 minus 0.0332e-34 is approximately 4.1848e-34 J·s.

Wait, let me check the exact multiplication. 3.9685 * 1.0545718. Let me do this more accurately.

3.9685 * 1.0545718.

I can compute 3 * 1.0545718 = 3.1637154.

0.9685 * 1.0545718. Let's compute that.

0.9685 * 1 is 0.9685.

0.9685 * 0.0545718 is approximately 0.0528 (since 0.9685 *0.05 is about 0.0484, and 0.9685 *0.0045718 is about ~0.00443; adding gives ≈0.05283.

So total for 0.9685 *1.0545718 is 0.9685 + 0.05283 ≈ 1.02133.

So 3.1637154 + 1.02133 = 4.1850454e-34 J·s. So approximately 4.185e-34.

Looking at the options, option J is 4.185 x 10^-34 J s. So that's the one.

To calculate the spin angular momentum of \( ^{43}\text{Ca} \), we use the formula for spin angular momentum:

\[
S = \hbar \cdot \sqrt{I(I+1)}
\]

where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)) and \( I = \frac{7}{2} \) is the nuclear spin quantum number.

### Step 1: Compute \( I(I+1) \)
\[
I(I+1) = \frac{7}{2} \cdot \frac{9}{2} = \frac{63}{4} = 15.75
\]

### Step 2: Take the square root
\[
\sqrt{I(I+1)} = \sqrt{15.75} \approx 3.9685
\]

### Step 3: Multiply by \( \hbar \)
\[
S = \hbar \cdot \sqrt{I(I+1)} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 3.9685
\]

Performing the multiplication:
\[
S \approx 4.185 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}
\]

### Final Answer
The spin angular momentum of \( ^{43}\text{Ca} \) is approximately \( 4.185 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), which corresponds to option **J**.
