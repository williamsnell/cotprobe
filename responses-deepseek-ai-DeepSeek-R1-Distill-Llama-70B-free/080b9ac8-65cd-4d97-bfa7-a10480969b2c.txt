Okay, so I've got this question about the Earth's internal energy source. Hmm, I remember from my geology class that the Earth's heat isn't just from the Sun. The question gives options A through J, and I need to pick the right one.

Let me think. The Earth's internal heat is what drives plate tectonics and volcanic activity, right? So it's not something like solar radiation, which is the Sun's energy. That would be option H, but that's probably not the answer because the question is about internal, not external sources.

Wait, what about gravitational pressure? I think when the Earth formed, a lot of energy was released as gravity pulled everything together. That process would generate heat. So option C, gravitational pressure, might be part of it. But is that the principal source now, or was it more during formation?

Oh, right, there's also radioactivity. I remember something about radioactive decay in the Earth's core and mantle. Elements like uranium and thorium decay, releasing heat over time. So option D, radioactivity, could be a main source. 

Nuclear fusion, option E, that's what powers the Sun, right? The Earth doesn't have fusion happening inside, so E is probably not the answer.

Thermal conduction (B) is more about how heat moves, not a source. Tidal friction (G) might contribute a little, but I don't think it's the main source. Wind energy (I) and cosmic radiation (J) don't seem relevant here.

Geothermal heat (F) is the heat from the Earth, but that's the result, not the source. So the source would be the processes that generate that heat, like radioactivity.

So putting it all together, the principal source should be radioactivity, which is option D.

The Earth's internal energy is primarily driven by processes that occur within its core and mantle, rather than external sources like solar radiation. Among the options provided, gravitational pressure (C) played a significant role during the Earth's formation, but it is not the principal source of internal energy today. Radioactivity (D), on the other hand, is a key ongoing source of heat, as radioactive decay of elements like uranium and thorium releases energy over time. This process is a major driver of the Earth's internal heat, which fuels geological activities such as plate tectonics and volcanic phenomena.

Answer: D
