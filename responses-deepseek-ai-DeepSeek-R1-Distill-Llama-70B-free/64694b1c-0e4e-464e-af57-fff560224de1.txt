Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrochemical cells and equilibrium concentrations. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on electrochemistry, but let's see if I can work through this.

The question is about a cell reaction: T + R^+2 ⇌ R + T^+2. I need to find the standard cell potential E° such that the equilibrium concentration of T²+ is a thousand times that of R^+2. The options are from A to J, each a different voltage.

Alright, first, I remember that in electrochemistry, the cell potential is related to the equilibrium concentrations through the Nernst equation. The Nernst equation at standard conditions (25°C, 1 atm) is E° = (RT/nF) ln K, where K is the equilibrium constant. Wait, but I think at standard conditions, the equation is E°cell = (0.0592 V / n) * log K at 25°C, right? Because R is 8.314, T is 298 K, F is 96485 C/mol. So 0.0592 V comes from (RT)/(nF) converted into log base 10.

So the cell reaction is T + R²+ → R + T²+. We need to write the two half-reactions. Let me think: oxidation and reduction.

In this reaction, T is oxidized because it goes from 0 to +2 (T²+), and R²+ is reduced to R (from +2 to 0). So the oxidation is T → T²+ + 2e^-. The reduction is R²+ + 2e^- → R.

So the cell potential E°cell would be E°cathode (reduction) minus E°anode (oxidation). But wait, T is the anode (oxidation), and R^+2 is the cathode (reduction). So E°cell = E°(cathode) - E°(anode).

But wait, the standard cell potential is also related to the equilibrium constant K. The reaction is T + R²+ → R + T²+. So the expression for K would be [T²+][R] / [T][R²+] = K.

Wait, the problem states that at equilibrium, [T²+] is 1000 times [R²+]. So let's say [R²+] = x, then [T²+] = 1000x.

But what about the other concentrations, [T] and [R]? Hmm, assuming they start with certain concentrations. Wait, the reaction as written starts with T and R²+ as reactants and produces R and T²+ as products. So if the reaction goes to reach equilibrium, the concentrations of T and R would change.

Wait, but for the reaction as written, without any initial products, we can assume that at equilibrium:

Let the initial concentrations be [T] = a, [R²+] = b. Let the change be -x for T and R²+, and +x for R and T²+. But maybe it's better to express K in terms of the given condition.

Wait, the problem states that at equilibrium, [T²+] = 1000 [R²+]. So K is equal to ([T²+][R]) / ([T][R²+]) ).

At equilibrium, let's say [R²+] = c, so [T²+] = 1000c. But what about [R] and [T]? Hmm, perhaps the reaction starts with some initial concentrations, but maybe we can assume that [R] is approximately equal to the amount produced, which would be x, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express [R] and [T] in terms of the initial concentrations and the change. Let me think: suppose initially, [T] is 1 M, [R²+] is 1 M, and [R] and [T²+] are 0. Then, as the reaction proceeds, x amount of T reacts with R²+ to form R and T²+. So at equilibrium:

[T] = 1 - x
[R²+] = 1 - x
[R] = x
[T²+] = x

Wait, but that's if the stoichiometry is 1:1. But looking back, the reaction is T + R²+ → R + T²+. So each mole of T reacts with a mole of R²+ to produce a mole of R and a mole of T²+. So the changes are all x. So:

At equilibrium:
[R] = x
[T²+] = x
[R²+] = 1 - x
[T] = 1 - x

But wait, the problem says that at equilibrium, [T²+] is 1000 times [R²+]. So x = 1000*(1 - x). Let's solve that: x = 1000 -1000x → x + 1000x = 1000 → 1001x =1000 → x ≈ 0.999000999... which is approximately 1. So [T²+] is approx 1 M, [R²+] is approx 0.001 M.

Wait, but wait, in the real scenario, the reaction might not go to completion, but in any case, the condition is [T²+] = 1000 [R²+].

So plugging into K:

K = ([T²+][R]) / ([T][R²+]) ) = (1000c * (x)) / ( (1-x) * c ) )

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me define the concentrations in terms of a variable.

Let me let [R²+] at equilibrium be y. Then [T²+] = 1000 y. Let the change in concentration from initial to equilibrium be:

Assume initial concentrations: [T] = a, [R²+] = b. At equilibrium, [T] = a - x, [R²+] = b - x, [R] = x, [T²+] = x. But according to the condition, [T²+] = 1000 [R²+], so x = 1000 (b -x ). Solving for x:

x = 1000b -1000x → x +1000x = 1000b → 1001x =1000b → x= (1000/1001) b.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe it's easier to use the relation from the Nernst equation. At equilibrium, the cell potential E is zero because the reaction is at equilibrium. But wait, the Nernst equation is E = E° - (0.0592/n) log Q, and at equilibrium, E = 0, so 0 = E° - (0.0592/n) log K. Therefore, E° = (0.0592/n) log K.

Wait, no, the Nernst equation is E = E° - (0.0592/n) log Q. At equilibrium, Q=K, and E=0, so 0 = E° - (0.0592/n) log K → E° = (0.0592/n) log K.

So I need to find K for the given condition, then use that to find E°.

So K is ([T²+][R]) / ([T][R²+]) ). From the problem, [T²+] = 1000 [R²+]. Let me denote [R²+] as c. So [T²+] = 1000 c.

But what about [T] and [R]? Let me think about the stoichiometry. The balanced equation is T + R²+ → R + T²+. So for each mole of reaction, one mole of T reacts with one mole of R²+ to produce one mole of R and one mole of T²+.

Assuming that the initial concentrations are [T] = a and [R²+] = b, and [R] = [T²+] = 0. Let x be the extent of reaction at equilibrium.

So at equilibrium:

[T] = a - x
[R²+] = b - x
[R] = x
[T²+] = x

Wait, but from the problem, [T²+] = 1000 [R²+], so x = 1000 (b -x )

x = 1000b - 1000x → x +1000x =1000b → 1001 x =1000 b → x = (1000/1001) b.

But this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider that at equilibrium, [R] = x and [T²+] = 1000 [R²+]. So let's say [R²+] = y, so [T²+] = 1000 y.

Then, the reaction is T + R²+ → R + T²+. So the concentrations are:

Assuming initial [T] = a, [R²+] = initial value, say, let's assume that initial [T] and [R²+] are 1M each, and [R] and [T²+] are 0. Then at equilibrium:

[T] = 1 - x
[R²+] = 1 - x
[R] = x
[T²+] = x

But according to the condition, [T²+] =1000 [R²+], so x =1000 (1 -x )

x =1000 -1000x → 1001 x =1000 → x= 1000/1001 ≈ 0.999.

So [R²+] =1 - x ≈ 1 -0.999=0.001 M.

Then, K would be ([T²+][R])/([T][R²+]) = (x * x ) / ( (1-x)(1 -x) ) ) = x²/( (1 - x)^2 )

Substituting x ≈0.999,

(0.999)^2 / (0.001)^2 ) = (approx 1) / (1e-6) )= 1e6.

Wait, but wait, let me compute that accurately.

x=1000/1001. So 1-x = (1001-1000)/1001 = 1/1001.

So [T]=1 -x = 1 - (1000/1001) )= 1/1001.

Similarly, [R²+] =1 -x =1/1001.

So K = (x^2) / ( [T][R²+] ) = ( (1000/1001)^2 ) / ( (1/1001)(1/1001) ) ) = ( (1000^2)/(1001^2) ) / (1/(1001^2)) ) = 1000^2 = 1,000,000.

So K = 1e6.

Now, using the equation E° = (0.0592 V / n ) * log K.

What's n here? The number of electrons transferred. Looking at the reaction: T is oxidized from 0 to +2, so each T loses 2 electrons. R²+ is reduced from +2 to 0, so each R²+ gains 2 electrons. So n=2.

So E° = (0.0592 / 2) * log(1e6) → 0.0296 * log(1e6).

Log(1e6) is 6, because 10^6 =1e6.

So E° = 0.0296 *6 = 0.1776 volts.

Wait, but none of the options are anywhere near 0.1776. The options are all around 0.03 to 0.12 volts. Hmm, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of K. Let me double-check.

The problem states that the equilibrium concentration of T²+ is a thousand times R²+. So [T²+] =1000 [R²+].

But the reaction is T + R²+ → R + T²+.

At equilibrium, the ratio is [T²+]/[R²+] =1000.

But when I wrote the expression for K, it's [T²+][R]/( [T][R²+] ) = K.

In terms of x:

At equilibrium, [T] = 1 -x, [R²+] = 1 -x, [R] =x, [T²+] =x.

But according to [T²+] =1000 [R²+], x=1000(1 -x) → x=1000 -1000x → 1001x=1000 → x=1000/1001.

So K = (x * x ) / ( (1 -x)(1 -x) ) = (x^2 )/( (1-x)^2 ) = ( (1000/1001)^2 ) / ( (1/1001)^2 ) = (1000^2 / 1001^2 ) * (1001^2 / 1^2 ) ) = 1000^2 =1e6.

So K=1e6, which makes E° = (0.0592/2)* log(1e6 )= 0.0296 *6 = 0.1776 V.

But the options don't have this value. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the reaction or the cell potential. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the reaction as written is the reverse of what I considered. Let me check the cell notation.

Wait, in a galvanic cell, the anode is where oxidation happens, and the cathode is where reduction happens. The cell reaction is written as anode + cathode.

In the given reaction, T is oxidized to T²+, and R²+ is reduced to R.

So the cell would have T as the anode (oxidation): T → T²+ + 2e^-

And the cathode is R²+ + 2e^- → R.

So the cell potential is E°cathode - E°anode.

But wait, the problem gives the reaction as T + R²+ ⇌ R + T²+.

So the cell would be constructed with T and T²+ as one half-cell, and R²+ and R as the other.

The standard cell potential E°cell is E°cathode minus E°anode.

Wait, but in the Nernst equation, E°cell is determined by the two standard potentials.

Alternatively, perhaps the cell potential can be found via E°cell = (E°cathode - E°anode).

But another approach is to consider the relation between E° and K, which I think I did correctly, leading to E°=0.1776 V, which isn't among the options.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me think again about the reaction.

Wait, another approach: the cell reaction is T(s) + R²+(aq) → T²+(aq) + R(s). So the two half-reactions are:

Anode (oxidation): T → T²+ + 2e^-
Cathode (reduction): R²+ + 2e^- → R.

So the cell potential E°cell = E°cathode - E°anode.

But E°cell is also related to the equilibrium constant K via E°cell = (0.0592/n) * log K.

Wait, but I've already calculated K as 1e6, n=2, so E°cell = (0.0592/2) * log(1e6) = 0.0296 *6= 0.1776 V.

But none of the options are close to 0.1776. Hmm, maybe the problem is that the reaction is written as T + R²+ → R + T²+, but perhaps the correct stoichiometry is different. Alternatively, perhaps the way I calculated K was wrong.

Wait, perhaps the problem doesn't involve the concentrations of T and R, assuming they are solids. Oh wait, wait, in electrochemistry, if T and R are solids (metals), then their activities are 1, and they don't appear in the K expression.

Wait, that's a crucial point I might have missed. Let me think: if T and R are solids, then their concentrations (activities) are considered 1 and don't appear in the equilibrium expression.

So the reaction is: T(s) + R²+(aq) ⇌ R(s) + T²+(aq).

In this case, the equilibrium expression K would be [T²+]/[R²+] = K.

Because [T(s)] and [R(s)] are 1 and don't appear.

So K = [T²+]/[R²+].

Given that at equilibrium, [T²+] is 1000 times [R²+], so K=1000.

Ah, that changes things! So K is 1000, not 1e6. That makes more sense.

So let me recalculate.

E° = (0.0592 V / n) * log K.

n=2, because two electrons are transferred.

So E°= (0.0592 /2 ) * log(1000).

Log(1000)=3.

So E°= 0.0296 *3 = 0.0888 V.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 0.088 V, which matches approximately.

So the correct answer should be B.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze the given cell reaction:

\[
T + R^{+2} \rightleftharpoons R + T^{+2}
\]

The goal is to calculate the standard cell potential \( E^\circ \) such that at equilibrium, the concentration of \( T^{+2} \) is 1000 times the concentration of \( R^{+2} \), i.e., \([T^{+2}] = 1000 [R^{+2}]\).

### Step 1: Equilibrium Constant Expression
The equilibrium constant \( K \) for the reaction is given by:

\[
K = \frac{[T^{+2}]}{[R^{+2}]}
\]

From the problem, \([T^{+2}] = 1000 [R^{+2}]\), so:

\[
K = 1000
\]

### Step 2: Relationship Between \( E^\circ \) and \( K \)
The standard cell potential \( E^\circ \) is related to \( K \) by the equation:

\[
E^\circ = \frac{0.0592}{n} \log K
\]

Here:
- \( n = 2 \), as 2 electrons are transferred in the reaction.
- \( \log K = \log(1000) = 3 \).

Substituting these values:

\[
E^\circ = \frac{0.0592}{2} \cdot 3 = 0.0888 \,
