Okay, so I have this graph problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to work through it. The question is about finding the shortest path from node 0 to node 5 in an undirected graph. The edges are given as E = {<0,1>, <0,2>, <0,3>, <3,5>, <2,3>, <2,4>, <4,5>}. 

First, I need to visualize the graph structure. Let me list out the connections each node has.

- Node 0 is connected to 1, 2, 3.
- Node 1 is connected to 0 only.
- Node 2 is connected to 0, 3, 4.
- Node 3 is connected to 0, 2, 5.
- Node 4 is connected to 2, 5.
- Node 5 is connected to 3, 4.

So, I'm trying to find the shortest path from 0 to 5. Shortest in terms of the number of edges, I think. So I'll probably need to do a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from node 0 and see which path reaches 5 with the fewest steps.

Alternatively, I can manually explore the possible paths since the graph isn't too big.

Let me think of the possible paths.

Starting at 0:

Option 1: 0 -> 3 ->5. That's two edges. Let me check the edges. Yes, 0 is connected to 3, and 3 is connected to 5. So that's a path of length 2.

Option 2: 0->2->3->5. That's three edges.

Option 3: 0->2->4->5. That's also three edges.

Wait, but option 1 is shorter, only two steps.

Wait, but looking at the edges again: E includes <3,5>, yes. So 0-3-5 is a direct path, right?

Wait, but the options given don't include this exact path. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option H is [0,3,5], which matches the path I just thought of. So that would be the shortest path with length 2.

But wait, let me look through the options to confirm.

Options:

A: [0,2,3,4,5] → length 4.

B: [0,2,3,5] → length 3.

C: [0,1,2,3,4,5] → longer.

D: [0,1,2,4,5] → length 4.

E: [0,2,4,5] → length 3.

F: [0,1,3,5] → length 3.

G: [0,1,4,5] → but wait, is 1 connected to 4? No, because node 1 is only connected to 0. So that path isn't possible. So F and G might have invalid connections.

Wait, let me check each option if the path is actually possible.

Option F: [0,1,3,5]. 0 is connected to 1, yes. 1 is connected to 3? Wait, node 1's edges are only <0,1>, so no, node 1 isn't connected to 3. So option F is invalid.

Option G: [0,1,4,5]. 0-1 is ok. 1 is not connected to 4, so that's invalid.

So the valid options are A, B, C, D, E, H, I, J.

Wait, let me check each option's validity.

Option H: [0,3,5]. 0-3 exists, 3-5 exists. So that's valid.

Option I: [0,3,2,4,5]. 0-3 is ok, 3-2 (since <2,3> is present), 2-4 (yes), 4-5 (yes). So that's a valid path, but longer than H.

So the shortest path is H: [0,3,5].

The problem involves finding the shortest path from node 0 to node 5 in an undirected graph with edges \( E = \{<0,1>, <0,2>, <0,3>, <3,5>, <2,3>, <2,4>, <4,5>\} \). The goal is to determine the path with the fewest edges.

### Graph Structure:
- Node 0 is connected to 1, 2, 3.
- Node 1 is connected only to 0.
- Node 2 is connected to 0, 3, 4.
- Node 3 is connected to 0, 2, 5.
- Node 4 is connected to 2, 5.
- Node 5 is connected to 3, 4.

### Analysis of Possible Paths:
1. **Path [0, 3, 5]:**  
   - 0 is connected to 3, and 3 is connected to 5.  
   - This is a valid path with only 2 edges, making it the shortest.

2. **Other Paths:**  
   - [0, 2, 3, 5]: Valid but longer (3 edges).  
   - [0, 2, 4, 5]: Valid but longer (3 edges).  
   - [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]: Valid but longer (5 edges).  
   - [0, 1, 2, 4, 5]: Valid but longer (4 edges).  
   - [0, 1, 3, 5]: Invalid because 1 is not connected to 3.  
   - [0, 1, 4, 5]: Invalid because 1 is not connected to 4.  
   - [0, 3, 2, 4, 5]: Valid but longer (4 edges).  

### Conclusion:
The shortest path from node 0 to node 5 is **[0, 3, 5]**, which corresponds to **Option H**.
