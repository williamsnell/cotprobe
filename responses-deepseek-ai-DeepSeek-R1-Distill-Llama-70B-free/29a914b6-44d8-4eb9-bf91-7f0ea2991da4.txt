Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that two moles of gaseous NH3 are introduced into a 1.0-liter vessel. They undergo partial decomposition at a high temperature. The reaction given is 2NH3 (g) ⇌ N2 (g) + 3H2 (g). At equilibrium, 1.0 mole of NH3 remains. I need to find the equilibrium constant, K, and choose the correct option from A to J.

Alright, so I remember that the equilibrium constant K is calculated using the concentrations of the products and reactants at equilibrium, each raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients. The formula is something like K = [N2][H2]^3 / [NH3]^2. Since all are gases, their concentrations are used.

But wait, the vessel is 1.0 liter, so I think the moles can be used directly as concentrations because concentration is moles per liter. So if I have 1 mole in 1 liter, that's 1 M. That should simplify things.

Let me set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) to track the changes.

The reaction is 2NH3 ⇌ N2 + 3H2.

Initially, there are 2 moles of NH3, and nothing else. So initial concentrations are [NH3] = 2 M, [N2] = 0, [H2] = 0.

Change will be based on the reaction. Let's say the change is -2x for NH3 (since 2 moles react), +x for N2, and +3x for H2.

At equilibrium, the problem states that NH3 is 1.0 mole. Since the vessel is 1 liter, [NH3] = 1.0 M.

So from the initial 2 M, the change is a decrease of x, so 2 - 2x = 1.0. Solving for x: 2 -1 = 2x → 1 = 2x → x=0.5.

So the changes are:
[NH3] = 1.0 M,
[N2] = x = 0.5 M,
[H2] = 3x = 1.5 M.

Now, plug these into the equilibrium expression.

K = [N2][H2]^3 / [NH3]^2.

Plugging in the values:
K = (0.5) * (1.5)^3 / (1.0)^2.

Let me calculate that step by step.

First, (1.5)^3 is 1.5 * 1.5 *1.5.
1.5 *1.5 is 2.25. Multiply by 1.5 again: 2.25 *1.5 = 3.375.

So the numerator is 0.5 * 3.375 = 1.6875.

Denominator is (1.0)^2 = 1. So K = 1.6875 / 1 = 1.6875.

Looking at the options, option F is 1.6875. So the correct answer should be F.

Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me recalculate.

(1.5)^3: 1.5 *1.5 is 2.25, then 2.25 *1.5: 2.25 *1 is 2.25, 2.25 *0.5 is 1.125. So 2.25 +1.125=3.375. Correct.

Then 0.5 * 3.375 = 1.6875. Yep, that's right. And the denominator is 1.0 squared, which is 1. So K=1.6875, which is option F.

To solve for the equilibrium constant \( K \), we start with the reaction:

\[
2\text{NH}_3 (g) \rightleftharpoons \text{N}_2 (g) + 3\text{H}_2 (g)
\]

The equilibrium constant expression is:

\[
K = \frac{[\text{N}_2][\text{H}_2]^3}{[\text{NH}_3]^2}
\]

Using the ICE table method:

- **Initial concentrations**: \([\text{NH}_3] = 2.0 \, \text{M}, [\text{N}_2] = 0, [\text{H}_2] = 0\).
- **Change**: Let \( x \) represent the change in \([\text{N}_2]\). Then, \([\text{NH}_3]\) decreases by \( 2x \), \([\text{N}_2]\) increases by \( x \), and \([\text{H}_2]\) increases by \( 3x \).
- **Equilibrium**: At equilibrium, \([\text{NH}_3] = 1.0 \, \text{M}\). From the change, \( 2 - 2x = 1.0 \), so \( x = 0.5 \).

At equilibrium:
- \([\text{NH}_3] = 1.0 \, \text{M}\),
- \([\text{N}_2] = x = 0.5 \, \text{M}\),
- \([\text{H}_2] = 3x = 1.5 \, \text{M}\).

Substitute these values into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K = \frac{(0.5)(1.5)^3}{(1.0)^2}
\]

First, calculate \((1.5)^3\):

\[
(1.5)^3 = 1.5 \times 1.5 \times 1.5 = 3.375
\]

Now calculate the numerator:

\[
(0.5)(3.375) = 1.6875
\]

The denominator is:

\[
(1.0)^2 = 1.0
\]

Thus:

\[
K = \frac{1.6875}{1.0} = 1.6875
\]

From the given options, the correct value of \( K \) is **1.6875**, which corresponds to **option F**.

Answer: F
