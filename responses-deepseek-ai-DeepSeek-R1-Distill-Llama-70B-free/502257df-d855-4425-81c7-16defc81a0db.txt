Okay, so I have this question about Say's Law, and I'm a bit fuzzy on exactly what it says. I remember that it's something to do with economics, probably related to supply and demand. Let me think.

Say's Law is often summarized as "supply creates its own demand." I think that's the main idea. So, the basic concept is that when you produce goods (supply), it generates income for people, which they can then use to demand other goods. So production leads to the ability to purchase, which in turn drives demand.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one matches this. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: When price goes up, supply goes up. That sounds more like the law of supply, which states that higher prices lead to higher quantity supplied. Not directly related to Say's Law.

Option B: Price and supply have no correlation. Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Say's Law isn't about price correlations, it's more about supply and demand.

Option C: When supply goes up, demand goes down. That doesn't fit. If supply increases, according to Say's Law, demand should increase as well because more production means more income.

Option D: Demand creates its own supply. Wait, that's the opposite of Say's Law. I think that's more like demand and supply in a normal market where demand leads to more production. But Say's Law flips that, saying supply leads to demand.

Option E: When demand goes up, supply goes down. That's not right. In a typical market, higher demand might lead to higher supply over time as producers respond, but Say's Law is a different concept.

Option F: When demand goes up, price goes down. That doesn't make sense in most contexts. Usually, higher demand leads to higher prices, unless it's a surplus situation.

Option G: Supply creates its own demand. Oh, that's exactly what I was thinking earlier. This sounds like the correct statement of Say's Law.

Option H: It's better to give than to receive. That's a philosophical statement, not related to economics.

Option I: Price creates its own demand. I don't think that's correct. It's more about how demand is influenced by prices, but that's not Say's Law.

Option J: It's better to receive than to give. Again, not related to economics; just another saying.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be option G. That's the one that aligns with Say's Law, which states that supply generates demand.

The correct answer is based on the understanding that Say's Law posits "supply creates its own demand." This means that production (supply) leads to income, which in turn enables consumption (demand). Among the options, only G aligns with this principle.

Answer: G
