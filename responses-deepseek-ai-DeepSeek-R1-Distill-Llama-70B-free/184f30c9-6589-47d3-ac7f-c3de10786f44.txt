Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many alpha particles per second are emitted from a given amount of Polonium-210. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the decay of a radioactive substance follows an exponential law, and the number of decays per second is related to the activity of the substance.

The question gives me 4 × 10^-12 grams of Po-210. I think I'll need to find out how many atoms are in that sample first. Oh right, Po-210 has an atomic mass, which I think is around 210 g/mol. Wait, yeah, because Polonium's atomic number is 84, and the isotope here is 210, so the mass number is 210. So molar mass is approximately 210 g/mol.

First step: Calculate the number of moles in 4e-12 grams. Moles = mass / molar mass. So that's (4e-12 g) / (210 g/mol). Let me compute that: 4e-12 divided by 210 is approximately 1.90476e-14 mol.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 4e-12 / 210 is like 4/(2.1e14) which is about 1.90476e-14 moles. Right.

Now, each mole has Avogadro's number of atoms, so number of atoms N = moles × Avogadro's number. Avogadro's is 6.022e23 atoms/mol. So N = 1.90476e-14 mol * 6.022e23 atoms/mol. Let's calculate that. Multiply 1.90476e-14 by 6.022e23.

1.90476e-14 * 6.022e23 = 1.90476 *6.022 = approx 11.47, then exponent is 10^(-14+23) = 1e9. Wait, wait, 1.9e-14 *6e23 = approx 1.14e10. Hmm, let me do it more accurately.

1.90476e-14 *6.022e23 = (1.90476 * 6.022) * 1e9.

1.90476 *6.022: Let's compute 1.9 *6=11.4, 0.047 *6=0.282. So 11.4 + 0.282 = 11.682, but wait, that's just the product of 1.9 and 6. Oh wait, wait. Wait, no, 1.90476 *6.022. Let me compute that more accurately.

1.90476 * 6.022. Let's break it down:

1.9 *6 = 11.4.

1.9 * 0.022 = 0.0418.

0.0476 *6 = 0.2856.

0.0476 *0.022 = approx 0.0010452.

Wait, maybe it's easier to just multiply 1.90476 * 6.022.

1.90476 ×6 = 11.42856.

1.90476 × 0.022 = approx 0.04190472.

Adding them gives 11.42856 + 0.04190472 = 11.47046.

So N ≈ 11.47046e9 atoms. Because the exponents are 1e9. So N ≈ 1.147046e10 atoms.

Wait, no. Wait, 1.90476e-14 *6.022e23 = (1.90476 *6.022) * 1e(23-14) )= 11.47 * 1e9 = 1.147e10 atoms. So about 1.147e10 atoms.

Now, I need to find the activity, which is the number of decays per second. Activity A is given by A = λN, where λ is the decay constant.

The half-life is given as 138 days. I need to convert that into seconds to find λ because the decay constant is per second. So 138 days × 24 hours/day × 60 minutes/hour × 60 seconds/minute.

Calculating that: 138 * 24 = 3312 hours. 3312 *60=198720 minutes. 198720 *60=11,923,200 seconds.

So t_half = 138 days = 11,923,200 s.

The decay constant λ is ln(2) / t_half. So λ ≈ 0.6931 / 11,923,200 s.

Compute λ: 0.6931 / 1.19232e7 ≈ Let me compute that.

Divide 0.6931 by 1.19232e7.

0.6931 / 1.19232 = approx 0.581, so 0.581 / 1e7 = 5.81e-8 per second.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

0.6931 / 11,923,200.

Let me compute 0.6931 / 1.19232e7.

First, 0.6931 ÷ 1.19232 = approximately 0.581. So 0.581 / 1e7 → 5.81e-8 s^-1.

So λ ≈ 5.81e-8 s^-1.

Now, activity A = λ * N = 5.81e-8 * 1.147e10.

Compute that: 5.81e-8 * 1.147e10 = (5.81 *1.147) * 1e2.

5.81 *1.147: Let's compute. 5 *1.147=5.735. 0.81 *1.147=0.931. So total ~5.735 +0.931=6.666.

So 6.666e2 → 666.6 decays per second.

So approximately 666.6, which is about 667. Looking at the options, option J is 666.94, which matches this, and option H is 450, which is lower. So the correct answer should be J.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations for any possible errors.

Wait, when calculating N, the number of atoms. Let me recalculate that step.

Mass of Po-210: 4e-12 g.

Molar mass = 210 g/mol.

Moles = (4e-12 g) / 210 g/mol = (4 / 210) * 1e-12 mol = (0.019047619) *1e-12 = 1.9047619e-14 mol.

Then number of atoms N = moles * Avogadro's number = 1.9047619e-14 *6.022e23 = (1.9047619 *6.022) * 1e9.

1.9047619 *6.022: Let me compute accurately.

1.9047619 *6 = 11.4285714.

1.9047619 *0.022 = 0.0419047.

So total is 11.4285714 + 0.0419047 ≈11.4704761.

So N ≈11.4704761e9 atoms, which is 1.14704761e10 atoms.

Then λ = ln(2) / (138 days in seconds).

Compute 138 days: 138 *24*3600.

138 *24 = 3312 hours.

3312 *3600 = 11,923,200 seconds.

So λ = 0.6931 / 11,923,200 = approx 5.814e-8 s^-1.

Then activity A = 5.814e-8 * 1.14704761e10 = (5.814 *1.14704761) * 1e2.

Compute 5.814 * 1.14704761.

5 *1.147 =5.735

0.814 *1.147: Let's compute.

0.8 *1.147 =0.9176

0.014 *1.147≈0.01605.

So total 0.9176 +0.01605=0.93365.

So 5.735 +0.93365 ≈6.66865.

So 6.66865e2 → 666.865 disintegrations per second.

Which is approximately 666.87, but looking at the options, J is 666.94. Hmm, perhaps my approximation of λ caused a slight discrepancy. Let me compute λ more accurately.

Compute λ: 0.69314718 / 11,923,200.

Compute 0.69314718 / 11,923,200.

Let me compute 0.69314718 divided by 1.19232e7.

Let me compute 0.69314718 ÷ 11,923,200.

Well, 11,923,200 = 1.19232e7.

So 0.69314718 / 1.19232e7 = ?

Let me compute this division:

0.69314718 ÷ 1.19232 = Let me compute this.

1.19232 * 0.58 = approx 0.6915 (since 1.19232 * 0.5 = 0.59616, 1.19232 *0.08 = 0.095386, total 0.591546). So 0.58 gives 0.591546. Hmm, but 0.69314718 is higher than that.

Wait, 1.19232 × 0.581 = Let me compute 1.19232 * 0.5 = 0.59616, 1.19232 *0.08=0.0953864, 1.19232 *0.001=0.00119232.

So 0.5 +0.08 +0.001 = 0.581.

0.59616 + 0.0953864 = 0.6915464 + 0.00119232 = 0.69273872.

Wait, that's 1.19232 × 0.581 = 0.69273872.

But the numerator is 0.69314718. So the difference is 0.69314718 - 0.69273872= 0.00040846.

So how much more? Let's see, 0.00040846 / 1.19232 ≈ approximately 0.0003428.

So 0.581 + 0.0003428 = approximately 0.5813428.

So λ ≈ 0.5813428e-7 → 5.8134e-8 s^-1.

So λ is approximately 5.8134e-8 s^-1.

Then A = λ*N =5.8134e-8 *1.14704761e10.

Multiply 5.8134e-8 *1.14704761e10.

Which is (5.8134 *1.14704761) * 1e2.

Compute 5.8134 *1.14704761.

Let me compute that:

5 *1.14704761 =5.73523805

0.8134 *1.14704761.

Compute 0.8 *1.14704761= 0.917638088

0.0134 *1.14704761 ≈0.0153737.

So 0.917638088 + 0.0153737≈ 0.933011788.

So total 5.73523805 +0.933011788=6.66825.

So 6.66825e2= 666.825.

But wait, when I calculated earlier, I got 666.865. So perhaps the exact value would be about 666.8 or so.

Looking at the options, option J is 666.94. Hmm, maybe I made a small error in the exact values.

Alternatively, perhaps I should carry out more precise calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps using exact values.

Wait, another approach: Use precise computation of λ.

t_half =138 days =138 *86400 seconds = 138 * 8.64e4 = let's compute 138 *8.64e4.

138 *8.64e4 = (100 *8.64e4) + (38 *8.64e4) = 8.64e6 + 3.2832e6 = 11.9232e6 seconds.

So t_half =11,923,200 s.

λ = ln2 / t_half =0.69314718056 / 11,923,200 ≈ let me compute this division.

Compute 0.69314718056 ÷ 11,923,200.

Using calculator-like steps:

11,923,200 is approximately 1.19232e7.

So 0.69314718056 / 1.19232e7 = (0.69314718056 / 1.19232) ) * 1e-7.

Compute 0.69314718056 ÷ 1.19232.

Let me compute that division.

1.19232 × 0.58 = 0.692738 (as before).

The difference is 0.69314718 -0.692738= 0.00040918.

So 0.00040918 / 1.19232 ≈ 0.0003433.

So λ = (0.58 + 0.0003433) * 1e-7 = 0.5803433 *1e-7 =5.803433e-8 s^-1.

So now compute A = λ * N.

N =1.14704761e10 atoms.

A=5.803433e-8 *1.14704761e10 = (5.803433 *1.14704761) *1e2.

Compute 5.803433 *1.14704761.

Hmm, let's compute accurately.

5 *1.14704761 =5.73523805

0.803433 *1.14704761.

Compute 0.8 *1.147=0.9176

0.003433 *1.14704761 ≈0.003433 *1.147≈0.00394.

So 0.9176 +0.00394≈0.92154.

So total 5.73523805 +0.92154=6.65677805.

So A=6.65677805e2 = 665.6778 per second.

Wait, that's about 665.68, but earlier I had 666.8. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps using exact values.

Alternatively, perhaps better to use a calculator-like approach:

Compute 5.803433e-8 *1.14704761e10.

Multiply the coefficients and add exponents:

5.803433 *1.14704761= approx, let me compute step by step.

5 *1.14704761 =5.73523805.

0.8 *1.14704761=0.917638088.

0.003433 *1.14704761= approx 0.00394.

Adding 5.73523805 +0.917638088 =6.652876138 +0.00394 =6.656816138.

So 6.6568161e2=665.68161.

Hmm, but earlier I thought I had 666. So this is around 665.68. Looking at the options, the closest is J:666.94. But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier, or perhaps I should recheck the number of atoms.

Wait, perhaps I should compute N more accurately.

N = (4e-12 g) / (210 g/mol) * 6.022e23 atoms/mol.

So N = (4e-12 /210) *6.022e23.

Compute 4 /210 = 0.019047619.

So 0.019047619 *6.022e23 = 0.019047619 *6.022 = let me compute exact.

0.019047619 *6 = 0.114285714.

0.019047619 *0.022=0.0004190476.

Sum: 0.114285714 +0.0004190476=0.1147047616.

So N =0.1147047616e23 atoms =1.147047616e22 atoms? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, 0.019047619 *6.022e23 = (0.019047619 *6.022) )e23.

Wait, 0.019047619 *6.022 = let me compute that:

0.019047619 *6 =0.114285714.

0.019047619 *0.022=0.0004190476.

Sum is 0.114285714 +0.0004190476 = 0.1147047616.

So 0.1147047616e23 =1.147047616e22 atoms?

Wait no, wait, 0.1147e23 is 1.147e22. Wait, no, 0.1147e23 is 1.147e22? No, because 0.1147e23 =1.147e22? No, because 1e22 is 10^22, and 0.1147e23 is 1.147e22. Yes.

Wait, but wait, 4e-12 grams is 4e-12 / 210 = approx 1.90476e-14 mol.

1.90476e-14 *6.022e23 = 1.90476 *6.022 = 11.47, times 1e9.

So 11.47e9 =1.147e10 atoms.

So N=1.147e10.

Then A=λ*N=5.8034e-8 *1.147e10= (5.8034 *1.147) *1e2.

Wait, 5.8034 *1.147: Let me compute this.

5 *1.147=5.735.

0.8034 *1.147.

Compute 0.8 *1.147=0.9176.

0.0034 *1.147=0.003898.

So 0.9176 +0.003898=0.921498.

So 5.735 +0.921498=6.656498.

So A=6.656498e2=665.6498 per second.

Hmm, that's about 665.65. So none of the options exactly match, but option J is 666.94. Wait, perhaps my approximations are causing this. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of moles.

Wait another approach: Let's compute N again.

4e-12 grams of Po-210.

Molar mass of Po-210 is 210 g
