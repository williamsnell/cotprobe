Okay, so I have this problem about radium-226 and its half-life. Hmm, I remember that the half-life is the time it takes for half of a given quantity of a radioactive substance to decay. The question is asking about the time it takes for the material to reduce by one-quarter, so that means three-quarters of it remains, right? Wait, no, wait. If it's reduced by a quarter, then it's 1 - 1/4 = 3/4 left. Or wait, no, let me think again. Oh wait, no, wait. If something is reduced by a quarter, it's gone down to 3/4 of the original? No, wait, reduced by a quarter would mean it's 1/4 less than the original. So if you start with 100%, after reduction by a quarter, you have 75% left. So that means 25% has decayed.

So the problem is to find the time it takes for 25% of the radium-226 to decay, leaving 75% remaining.

I remember the formula for radioactive decay is N(t) = N0 * (1/2)^(t / t_half), where N(t) is the remaining quantity, N0 is the initial quantity, t is time, and t_half is the half-life.

In this case, N(t)/N0 is 0.75, because 75% remains. So 0.75 = (1/2)^(t / 1620).

I need to solve for t. Let's see. Taking natural logs on both sides. So ln(0.75) = (t / 1620) * ln(1/2). 

Wait, ln(1/2) is negative. Let me compute this step by step.

Let me rewrite the equation:

0.75 = (1/2)^(t / 1620)

Taking natural log of both sides:

ln(0.75) = (t/1620) * ln(0.5)

Because (1/2) is 0.5. So I can rearrange this to solve for t.

t = (ln(0.75) / ln(0.5)) ) * 1620

Hmm, let me compute the values.

First, ln(0.75) is approximately what? Let me think. I know that ln(1) is 0. ln(0.5) is about -0.6931. But 0.75 is between 0.5 and 1, so its ln should be negative but not as much as 0.5. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 0.75 is e^x, what is x? Let me think. I remember that ln(3/4) is ln(0.75). Let me compute that. Alternatively, I can use a calculator in my head. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of logarithms base 2.

Wait, alternatively, I can use the formula with base 2. Because ln(0.75) is equal to ln(3/4) = ln(3) - ln(4). But maybe that's getting too detailed. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the change of base formula.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to work in terms of log base 1/2. Because (1/2) to the power of something equals 0.75. So let me think about this.

Because 0.75 is 3/4, which is 3/4. So 3/4 is the remaining, so the exponent would be log base (1/2) of 3/4. Because (1/2)^x = 3/4.

Wait, so x is the exponent. So if I can find x such that (1/2)^x = 3/4, then x is the ratio t/t_half.

Wait, but 1/2 is the same as 2^(-1), so (2^-1)^x = 2^(-x) = 3/4. Hmm, but 3/4 is 3/(2^2), so not a power of 2. So that approach might not be so helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps using natural logs is better.

So going back to the equation:

t = [ ln(0.75) / ln(0.5) ] * 1620

Let me compute ln(0.75) and ln(0.5). I remember that ln(0.5) is about -0.6931. For ln(0.75), perhaps I can approximate it. Alternatively, I can use exact values.

Wait, 0.75 is 3/4, which is 1 - 1/4, so maybe using a Taylor expansion for ln(1 - x) around x=0.25.

But perhaps that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it numerically.

Wait, I think ln(0.75) is approximately -0.28768. Let me check: e^(-0.28768) should be approximately 0.75.

e^(-0.28768) ≈ 0.75? Let me see, e^0.28768 is about 1.333, so 1/1.333 is about 0.75. So yes, that's correct. So ln(0.75) is about -0.28768.

So putting it all together:

t = [ (-0.28768) / (-0.6931) ) ] * 1620

The negatives cancel out, so 0.28768 / 0.6931 is approximately 0.415.

Wait, let me do the division more accurately.

0.28768 divided by 0.6931.

Let me compute 0.28768 / 0.6931.

Well, 0.6931 goes into 0.28768 about how many times? Let's see:

0.6931 * 0.4 = 0.27724

0.6931 * 0.41 = 0.6931 *0.4 + 0.6931*0.01 = 0.27724 + 0.006931 = 0.284171

That's 0.41 times 0.6931 is 0.284171, which is very close to 0.28768.

The difference is 0.28768 - 0.284171 = 0.003509.

So how much more? 0.003509 / 0.6931 ≈ approximately 0.00506.

So total is about 0.41 + 0.00506 ≈ 0.41506.

So approximately 0.415.

So t ≈ 0.415 * 1620.

Calculating 0.415 * 1620.

Let me compute that.

0.4 * 1620 = 648.

0.015 * 1620 = 24.3.

So 0.415 is 0.4 + 0.015, so 648 +24.3 = 672.3.

So approximately 672.3 years.

Looking at the options, option B is 672.4 years, which matches.

So the correct answer should be B.

To determine the time period during which a given amount of radium-226 is reduced by one-quarter, we start by noting that the half-life of radium-226 is 1620 years. The decay process follows the formula:

\[
N(t) = N_0 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t / t_{\text{half}}}
\]

Here, \(N(t)\) represents the remaining quantity of the material, \(N_0\) is the initial quantity, \(t\) is the time, and \(t_{\text{half}}\) is the half-life. Since the material is reduced by one-quarter, 75% of the material remains, meaning:

\[
\frac{N(t)}{N_0} = 0.75
\]

Substituting into the decay formula:

\[
0.75 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t / 1620}
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(0.75) = \frac{t}{1620} \cdot \ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)
\]

Rearranging to solve for \(t\):

\[
t = \frac{\ln(0.75)}{\ln(0.5)} \cdot 1620
\]

Using approximate values for the logarithms:

\[
\ln(0.75) \approx -0.28768, \quad \ln(0.5) \approx -0.6931
\]

Substituting these values:

\[
t = \frac{-0.28768}{-0.6931} \cdot 1620 \approx 0.415 \cdot 1620
\]

Performing the multiplication:

\[
t \approx 0.415 \cdot 1620 \approx 672.3 \, \text{years}
\]

This matches the given option \(B: 672.4 \, \text{years}\).
