Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the smallest positive integer that satisfies three different remainder conditions. Let's see. The problem says:

- When divided by 4, the remainder is 1.
- When divided by 3, the remainder is 2.
- When divided by 7, the remainder is 5.

Hmm, okay, I think this is a problem involving the Chinese Remainder Theorem, but maybe I can solve it step by step without getting too complicated.

Let me break it down. Let's denote the number we're looking for as N.

So, the first condition is N ≡ 1 mod 4. That means N can be written as 4k + 1 for some integer k.

Similarly, the second condition is N ≡ 2 mod 3. So N is 3m + 2 for some integer m.

Third condition is N ≡ 5 mod 7. So N is 7n + 5 for some integer n.

I think I can approach this by finding numbers that satisfy each condition and then find the smallest common one.

Let's start with the first condition: N ≡1 mod4. So possible numbers are 1,5,9,13,17,21,25,29,33,... etc.

Next, the second condition: N ≡2 mod3. Let's list some numbers that fit this: 2,5,8,11,14,17,20,23,26,29,32,35, etc.

Wait, I notice that 5 appears in both lists. So 5 is a common number. Let me check the third condition: does 5 mod7 equal 5? Well, 5 divided by7 is 0 with remainder5, so yes. Oh wait, but 5 is in all three conditions. But wait, the problem is looking for the smallest positive integer, so is 5 the answer? Let me check the options given. The options are A:17, B:22, C:31, D:26, E:13, F:15, G:20, H:10, I:35, J:11. Oh, 5 isn't an option, so maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Let me recheck. Because maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me think again.

Wait, when N is divided by 7, the remainder is 5. So N must be 5 more than a multiple of7. So the numbers are 5,12,19,26,33,40, etc.

Wait, okay, so now I have three lists:

List1 (mod4=1): 1,5,9,13,17,21,25,29,33,37,...

List2 (mod3=2):2,5,8,11,14,17,20,23,26,29,32,35,38,...

List3 (mod7=5):5,12,19,26,33,40, etc.

I'm looking for the smallest N that's in all three lists.

Looking for common numbers. Let's look for the first common in all three.

From the first two lists, the common numbers are 5,17,29, etc.

Now check if any of these are in the third list.

5 is in list3, so N=5. But wait, 5 isn't in the options provided. Hmm, the options start at 10, 11,13, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. Maybe I'm not considering all the congruencies correctly.

Alternatively, maybe I should approach this using modular equations.

Let me try to solve the congruencies step by step.

First, N ≡1 mod4 and N≡2 mod3.

Let me find a number that satisfies both.

N=4k+1. This should also be ≡2 mod3.

So 4k+1 ≡2 mod3 →4k ≡1 mod3. Since 4 is congruent to 1 mod3, so 4k ≡k mod3. So k ≡1 mod3. So k=3m +1.

Thus, N=4(3m+1)+1=12m +4 +1=12m+5.

So N can be 5,17,29,41,... etc.

Now, this N must also satisfy N≡5 mod7. So N=12m+5 ≡5 mod7.

So 12m +5 ≡5 mod7 →12m ≡0 mod7.

12 mod7 is 5. So 5m ≡0 mod7 →5m is divisible by7.

Since 5 and7 are coprime, m must be a multiple of7. So m=7n.

So substituting back, N=12*(7n) +5=84n +5.

The smallest positive integer is when n=0 →N=5, but again, 5 isn't in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem.

Wait the options don't include 5. Did I make a mistake? Let me check the problem again.

Wait, the problem says the remainder when divided by 7 is 5. So N mod7=5. So N=7p +5, for some p≥0.

So when p=0, N=5; p=1, N=12; p=2,19; p=3,26; p=4,33; p=5,40; etc.

From earlier, the numbers that satisfy the first two conditions are 5,17,29,41,53,65,77, etc.

Looking for the first number that's also in the third condition's list (5,12,19,26,33,40,47,54,61,68,75,82, etc.)

So 5 is the first, but it's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking at the options, let's see which of them satisfy all three conditions.

Let me evaluate each option:

Option A:17

Check 17 mod4 →1 (correct), 17 mod3 → 17/3 is 5*3=15, 17-15=2 (correct), 17 mod7 →17-14=3, which is not 5. So no.

Option B:22

22 mod4 →22-20=2 → remainder 2. Not 1. So no.

Option C:31

31 mod4 →31-28=3 → remainder3. Not 1.

Option D:26

26 mod4 →26-24=2 → rem 2≠1.

Option E:13

13 mod4 →13-12=1 → good.

13 mod3 →13-12=1 → rem1≠2. So no.

Option F:15

15 mod4 →15-12=3 → rem3≠1.

Option G:20

20 mod4 →0≠1.

Option H:10

10 mod4 →2≠1.

Option I:35

35 mod4 →35-32=3→ rem3≠1.

Option J:11

11 mod4 →11-8=3→ rem3≠1.

Wait, none of the options seem to satisfy all three conditions except maybe 5, which isn't present. But that can't be right because the question must have an answer among the options. Did I make a mistake?

Wait perhaps I miscalculated when checking the options. Let me check each again.

Wait let's try option D: 26.

26 divided by4: 4*6=24, 26-24=2 → rem2≠1. So no.

Option A:17.

17/4 →4*4=16, rem1 → good.

17/3 →5*3=15, rem2 → good.

17/7 →2*7=14, rem3 → not5. So no.

Hmm. Let's try to think again. Maybe the correct number is 26?

Wait, wait. 26 mod4 is 2, which isn't 1. So no.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a number. Let me think: the possible N's are 5,17,29,41,53,65,...

Looking for N in these that also are ≡5 mod7.

So let's compute 5 mod7=5 → yes.

17 mod7: 14 is 2*7, so 17-14=3 → rem3≠5.

29 mod7: 28 is4*7, so rem1→ no.

41 mod7: 41-35=6 → rem6≠5.

53 mod7: 53-49=4 → rem4≠5.

65 mod7: 63 is9*7, so 65-63=2 → rem2≠5.

77 mod7=0 → no.

Wait, next is 89: 89-84=5 → rem5. So 89 is 12m+5, and 89 mod7=5. So 89 is a solution. But 89 isn't among the options.

Wait, the options don't have 89, so perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe I should look for a number that satisfies all three conditions, regardless of the approach I took earlier.

Wait, perhaps I can set up equations.

We have:

N ≡1 mod4 →N=4a+1

N ≡2 mod3 →4a+1 ≡2 mod3 →4a ≡1 mod3 →a≡1 mod3 (since 4≡1 mod3, so a≡1 mod3 →a=3b+1)

So N=4*(3b+1)+1=12b+5

Now, N ≡5 mod7 →12b +5 ≡5 mod7 →12b ≡0 mod7

12 mod7 is 5, so 5b≡0 mod7 →5b is divisible by7. So b must be ≡0 mod7, since 5 and7 are coprime.

Thus, b=7c →N=12*(7c)+5=84c+5.

So the smallest N is when c=0 →N=5. But 5 isn't an option. The next is c=1 →89, which is 84+5=89. Still not in options.

Wait, maybe the problem is that I'm missing something in the way I'm solving the congruencies. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait another approach: Let's list numbers that satisfy mod4=1 and mod3=2, and see which of those also satisfy mod7=5.

We have numbers from mod4=1 and mod3=2: starting from 5, then 17,29,41,53,65,77,89,...

Now, check which of these, when divided by7, leave remainder5.

5 mod7=5 → yes.

17 mod7=3 → no.

29 mod7=1 → no.

41 mod7=6 → no.

53 mod7=4 → no.

65 mod7=2 → no.

77 mod7=0 → no.

89 mod7=5 → yes.

So the numbers that satisfy all three are 5,89,173,... So the smallest is 5, but it's not in the options.

Wait, the options don't include 5. Did I make a mistake? Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A:17

B:22

C:31

D:26

E:13

F:15

G:20

H:10

I:35

J:11

Hmm, none of these are 5 or 89. So perhaps I made an error in interpreting the problem.

Wait, let me read the problem again.

It says: leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by4, remainder 2 when divided by3, and remainder5 when divided by7.

Wait, perhaps I should check each option against all three conditions.

Let me check option D:26.

26 divided by4: 6*4=24, remainder 2 → not 1. So not good.

Option I:35.

35 divided by4: 8*4=32, rem3→ not1.

Option C:31.

31/4 →7*4=28, rem3→ not1.

Option B:22.

22/4 →5*4=20, rem2→ not1.

Option A:17.

17/4→4*4=16, rem1→ good.

17/3→5*3=15, rem2→ good.

17/7→2*7=14, rem3→ not5. So no.

Option D:26.

26/4=6 rem2 → no.

Option E:13.

13/4=3 rem1→ good.

13/3=4 rem1→ not2. So no.

Option J:11.

11/4=2 rem3→ no.

Option G:20.

20/4=5 rem0→ no.

Option H:10.

10/4=2 rem2→ no.

Option F:15.

15/4=3 rem3→ no.

Hmm, none of the options satisfy all three conditions. But the problem says to select from the options, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated for one of the options. Let me check option I:35.

35 divided by4 is 8*4=32, rem3→ not1.

Option I:35/7=5, rem0→ but the condition is rem5, so no.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: Let's find N such that N=4a+1, N=3b+2, N=7c+5.

We can set 4a+1=3b+2 →4a-3b=1. Let's solve for a and b.

Looking for integer solutions. Let's express a in terms of b: a=(3b+1)/4.

We need a to be integer, so 3b+1 must be divisible by4 →3b ≡-1 mod4 →3b≡3 mod4 →b≡1 mod4 (since 3 and4 are coprime, multiplying both sides by the inverse of3 mod4, which is 3 because 3*3=9≡1 mod4).

So b=4k +1, where k is integer ≥0.

So substituting back, b=4k+1 →N=3*(4k+1)+2=12k+5.

So N=12k+5.

Now, this N must also satisfy N=7c+5 →12k+5=7c+5 →12k=7c.

So 12k must be divisible by7 →since 12 and7 are coprime, k must be a multiple of7 →k=7m, where m is integer ≥0.

Thus, N=12*(7m)+5=84m+5.

So the possible N's are 5,89,173, etc.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the problem is designed incorrectly, or I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me try another approach.

Let me list the numbers that satisfy N ≡1 mod4 and N≡2 mod3, and then check which of those also satisfy N≡5 mod7.

Numbers that satisfy N≡1 mod4:1,5,9,13,17,21,25,29,33,37,41,45,49,53,57,61,65,69,73,77,81,85,89,...

From these, pick those that are ≡2 mod3:

Check each:

1 mod3=1→ no.

5 mod3=2→ yes.

9 mod3=0→ no.

13 mod3=1→ no.

17 mod3=2→ yes.

21 mod3=0→ no.

25 mod3=1→ no.

29 mod3=2→ yes.

33 mod3=0→ no.

37 mod3=1→ no.

41 mod3=2→ yes.

45 mod3=0→ no.

49 mod3=1→ no.

53 mod3=2→ yes.

57 mod3=0→ no.

61 mod3=1→ no.

65 mod3=2→ yes.

69 mod3=0→ no.

73 mod3=1→ no.

77 mod3=2→ yes.

81 mod3=0→ no.

85 mod3=1→ no.

89 mod3=2→ yes.

So the numbers are 5,17,29,41,53,65,77,89,...

Now, check each of these against mod7=5.

5 mod7=5→ yes. So 5 is a solution.

17 mod7=3→ no.

29 mod7=1→ no.

41 mod7=6→ no.

53 mod7=4→ no.

65 mod7=2→ no.

77 mod7=0→ no.

89 mod7=5→ yes.

So the smallest N is 5, but again, it's not in the options. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check the problem again.

Wait, the problem says: remainder 5 when divided by7. So N mod7=5.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should consider that when N is divided by7, the remainder is 5, so N=7k+5.

Let me list some N's:

k=0→5

k=1→12

k=2→19

k=3→26

k=4→33

k=5→40

k=6→47

k=7→54

k=8→61

k=9→68

k=10→75

k=11→82

k=12→89

Now, check which of these numbers satisfy the other two conditions.

Check N=5: mod4=1→ yes, mod3=2→ yes.

So 5 is correct, but it's not an option.

Next, N=12:

12 mod4=0→ no.

N=19:

19 mod4=3→ no.

N=26:

26 mod4=2→ no.

N=33:

33 mod4=1→ yes.

33 mod3=0→ no. Because 33 is divisible by3. So remainder 0≠2.

So no.

N=40:

40 mod4=0→ no.

N=47:

47 mod4=3→ no.

N=54:

54 mod4=2→ no.

N=61:

61 mod4=1→ yes.

61 mod3=1→ no (since 61/3 is 20*3=60, rem1→ no).

N=68:

68 mod4=0→ no.

N=75:

75 mod4=3→ no.

N=82:

82 mod4=2→ no.

N=89:

89
