Okay, so I've got this problem about estimating the collisional cross section of CO₂ given its diffusion coefficient. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, I remember that diffusion coefficients relate to how gases move and collide. Oh right, the diffusion coefficient (D) is connected to the mean free path and stuff. Wait, the formula... I think it's D = (1/3) * λ * v_avg, where λ is the mean free path and v_avg is the average velocity. But wait, another approach comes to mind involving the Chapman-Enskog theory, which might be more precise here.

Chapman-Enskog theory gives the diffusion coefficient as D = ( (k_B T) / (3 μ σ) ) * sqrt( (2 m) / (π k_B T) ) ), but I'm not too sure. Maybe I should write down what I know.

Wait, the diffusion coefficient for gas A in gas B can be estimated using the formula D = ( (k_B T) / (3 π η) ) * (1/ c), where η is the viscosity and c is the concentration. Hmm, but I don't have the viscosity here. Maybe I should think about the kinetic theory of gases more.

Another thought: the diffusion coefficient is also given by D = ( (1/3) * λ * v_avg ). The mean free path λ is (k_B T) / (sqrt(2) π d² P), where d is the collision diameter (so the cross section σ is π d², I think). Wait, maybe I'm confusing some terms here.

Let me get the right formula. The diffusion coefficient D can be expressed using the Chapman-Enskog equation, which for monatomic gases is D = ( ( (k_B T) * sqrt( (2 m) / (π k_B T) ) ) ) / ( 3 * sqrt(2) * π d² * n ) ). Wait, but n is the number density, which is P/(k_B T) from ideal gas law. Let me substitute that.

So n = P/(k_B T). Substituting into D, I get D = ( (k_B T) * sqrt(2 m / (π k_B T)) ) ) / (3 * sqrt(2) * π d² * (P/(k_B T)) ) )

Simplify this. Let's see, the numerator is (k_B T) * sqrt( (2 m) / (π k_B T) ) )

The denominator is 3 * sqrt(2) * π d² * (P/(k_B T)) )

So when you divide, the k_B T in the numerator and denominator will cancel. Let's compute step by step.

First, let's compute the numerator:

(k_B T) * sqrt( (2 m) / (π k_B T) ) = sqrt( (k_B T)^2 * (2 m) / (π k_B T) )) = sqrt( (k_B T * 2 m) / π ) )

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me square the numerator and denominator to simplify.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write D in terms of known variables. Let's think about the formula again.

Wait, another approach I remember is that the diffusion coefficient D can be expressed as:

D = ( (k_B T) / (3 π η) ) * (1 / c )

But I don't know η (viscosity) or c (concentration). Maybe that's not the way to go.

Wait, another formula I found in my notes is D = ( (1/3) λ v_avg ), where λ is the mean free path. And the mean free path λ is (k_B T) / (sqrt(2) π d² P ). Let me plug that into D.

So D = (1/3) * [ (k_B T) / (sqrt(2) π d² P) ) ] * v_avg.

And v_avg is sqrt( (8 k_B T) / (π m) ), right? Because the average speed v_avg = sqrt(8 k_B T / (π m)).

So substituting v_avg into D:

D = (1/3) * [ (k_B T) / (sqrt(2) π d² P) ) ] * sqrt(8 k_B T / (π m) )

Now let's simplify this expression.

First, handle the constants:

1/3 times 1/sqrt(2) π d² P times sqrt(8) / sqrt(π m).

Wait, let's write it all out:

D = (1/3) * (k_B T) / (sqrt(2) π d² P) ) * sqrt(8 k_B T / (π m))

Let me square the terms to make it easier.

Wait, let's compute the product inside:

(k_B T) * sqrt(8 k_B T) = (k_B T) * (8 k_B T)^(1/2) = (k_B T)^(3/2) * 8^(1/2).

And the denominator terms: sqrt(2) π d² P * sqrt(π m) = sqrt(2) * π^(3/2) * d² P * m^(1/2).

Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me try to compute it step by step.

Let me collect the terms:

Numerator factors:

- (1/3)
- (k_B T) from the first term
- sqrt(8 k_B T) from the second term.

Denominator factors:

- sqrt(2) π d² P from the first term
- sqrt(π m) from the second term.

So let's write D as:

D = (1/3) * [ (k_B T) * sqrt(8 k_B T) ) / ( sqrt(2) π d² P * sqrt(π m) ) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator.

First, the numerator in the fraction:

(k_B T) * sqrt(8 k_B T) = (k_B T) * (8 k_B T)^(1/2) = (k_B T) * (2√2) (k_B T)^(1/2) ) 

Which is 2√2 * (k_B T)^(3/2)

Denominator in the fraction:

sqrt(2) π d² P * sqrt(π m) = sqrt(2) * sqrt(π) * π d² P * sqrt(m)

Wait, let me compute sqrt(2) * sqrt(π) * sqrt(π m):

sqrt(2) * sqrt(π) * sqrt(π m) = sqrt(2) * π * sqrt(m)

Wait, because sqrt(π) * sqrt(π m) = sqrt( π^2 m ) = π sqrt(m).

So denominator becomes sqrt(2) * π sqrt(m) * d² P.

Wait, putting it all together:

D = (1/3) * [ 2√2 (k_B T)^(3/2) ) / ( sqrt(2) π sqrt(m) d² P ) )

Simplify the constants:

2√2 divided by sqrt(2) is 2√2 / sqrt(2) = 2.

So now D becomes:

D = (1/3) * [ 2 (k_B T)^(3/2) ) / ( π sqrt(m) d² P ) ]

Which is (2/3) * (k_B T)^(3/2) / ( π sqrt(m) d² P )

Hmm, I think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe another approach. Let me think about the Chapman-Enskog formula for diffusion coefficient.

Another formula I found is D = ( (k_B T)^(3/2) ) / ( (3/8) π^(3/2) d² sqrt(m) P ) )

Wait, perhaps I should look up the correct formula for diffusion coefficient in terms of collision cross-section.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the relation involving the molar mass and temperature.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

D = ( ( (k_B T) / (3 π η) ) ) * (1/c )

But I don't have η, the viscosity. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: The diffusion coefficient can be expressed in terms of the root mean square speed, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should recall that the collisional cross-section σ is related to the diffusion coefficient via σ = π d², where d is the collision diameter. So the cross-section is the effective area that the molecule presents during collisions.

Wait, perhaps I can use the formula D = (1/3) * λ * v_avg, where λ is the mean free path, and v_avg is the average speed.

The mean free path λ is given by (k_B T) / (sqrt(2) π d² P ), right?

And average speed v_avg is sqrt(8 k_B T / (π m)).

Putting it together:

D = (1/3) * [ (k_B T) / (sqrt(2) π d² P) ) ] * [ sqrt(8 k_B T / (π m)) ]

Let me compute this step by step.

Multiply the terms:

(1/3) * [ (k_B T) * sqrt(8 k_B T) ] / [ sqrt(2) π d² P * sqrt(π m) ) ]

Hmm, let's compute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (k_B T) * sqrt(8 k_B T) = (k_B T) * (8 k_B T)^(1/2) = (k_B T)^(3/2) * (8)^(1/2) = (k_B T)^(3/2) * 2√2.

Denominator: sqrt(2) * π * d² * P * sqrt(π m) = sqrt(2) * π^(3/2) * d² P * m^(1/2).

So putting it all together:

D = (1/3) * [ (2√2) (k_B T)^(3/2) ) ] / [ sqrt(2) π^(3/2) d² P m^(1/2) ) ]

Simplify the constants:

2√2 / sqrt(2) = 2√2 / (√2) ) = 2.

So:

D = (1/3) * [ 2 (k_B T)^(3/2) ) ] / [ π^(3/2) d² P m^(1/2) ) ]

Which simplifies to:

D = (2/3) * (k_B T)^(3/2) / ( π^(3/2) d² P m^(1/2) )

I think that's correct. Now, let's solve for d², since σ = π d².

Wait, we need to find σ, which is π d², so let's solve for d² first.

Rearranging the equation for d²:

d² = (2/3) * (k_B T)^(3/2) / ( π^(3/2) D P m^(1/2) )

Hmm, but wait, I'm not sure if I should be solving for d² in this way. Let me make sure.

Wait, let's write the equation as:

D = (2/3) * (k_B T)^(3/2) / ( π^(3/2) d² P m^(1/2) )

So solving for d² gives:

d² = (2/3) * (k_B T)^(3/2) / ( π^(3/2) D P m^(1/2) )

But m is the mass of a single molecule, right? So m = M * N_A, where M is the molar mass.

Wait, let me note down all the known variables.

Given:

D = 1.00e-5 m²/s

T = 273 K

P = 1 atm = 101325 Pa

k_B = Boltzmann constant = 1.380649e-23 J/K

M for CO₂: molar mass is 44 g/mol = 0.044 kg/mol.

So m = M * N_A = 0.044 kg/mol / 6.022e23 mol⁻¹ = approx 7.31e-26 kg.

Wait, let me compute m:

0.044 kg/mol divided by 6.022e23 = 0.044 / 6.022e23 = 7.306e-26 kg.

So m is 7.306e-26 kg.

Now, let's plug everything into the equation for d².

Wait, perhaps it's better to plug into the equation for D and solve for d².

But let me write the equation again:

d² = (2/3) * (k_B T)^(3/2) / ( π^(3/2) D P m^(1/2) )

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-express:

From earlier,

D = (2/3) * (k_B T)^(3/2) / ( π^(3/2) d² P m^(1/2) )

So,

d² = (2/3) * (k_B T)^(3/2) / ( π^(3/2) D P m^(1/2) )

So,

d² = (2 k_B^(3/2) T^(3/2) ) / (3 π^(3/2) D P m^(1/2) )

Hmm, let's compute this step by step.

First, compute numerator: 2 * k_B^(3/2) * T^(3/2)

k_B = 1.380649e-23 J/K

T = 273 K

So,

k_B^(3/2) = (1.380649e-23)^(1.5) = let's compute that.

But maybe it's easier to compute each term as I go.

Alternatively, perhaps I can plug in the numbers step by step.

Compute each part:

1. Compute k_B * T:

k_B * T = 1.380649e-23 J/K * 273 K = 3.769e-21 J

So (k_B T) = 3.769e-21 J

Now, (k_B T)^(3/2) = (3.769e-21)^(1.5)

Let me compute that. Let's compute the square root first: sqrt(3.769e-21) = approx 6.14e-11 J^(1/2)

Wait, J is kg m²/s², so J^(1/2) is kg^(1/2) m/s.

But perhaps that's not necessary. So (3.769e-21)^(3/2) = (3.769)^(3/2) * (1e-21)^(3/2) )

(3.769)^(3/2) is sqrt(3.769) * 3.769.

sqrt(3.769) ≈ 1.942

So 1.942 * 3.769 ≈ 7.324

(1e-21)^(3/2) = 1e-31.5 = 3.16e-32

So (k_B T)^(3/2) ≈ 7.324 * 3.16e-32 = approx 2.313e-31 J^(3/2)

Wait, but perhaps I should compute 3.769e-21 raised to 3/2.

Alternatively, using exponents: (3.769e-21)^(3/2) = 3.769^(3/2) * (1e-21)^(3/2) )= approx 7.32 * 1e-31.5 = 7.32e-31.5 = 7.32e-31.5 ≈ 2.3e-31 (since 1e-31.5 is 3.16e-32, 7.32 *3.16e-32 = 23.14e-32 = 2.31e-31 )

So numerator term 2 * (k_B T)^(3/2) is 2 * 2.31e-31 = 4.62e-31.

Denominator terms:

3 * π^(3/2) * D * P * m^(1/2)

Compute each:

3 is just 3.

π^(3/2) is π * sqrt(π) ≈ 3.1416 * 1.77245 ≈ 5.568.

D = 1e-5 m²/s

P = 101325 Pa

m is 7.306e-26 kg, so m^(1/2) is sqrt(7.306e-26) = approx 8.547e-13 kg^(1/2)

Putting it all together:

Denominator = 3 * 5.568 * 1e-5 * 101325 * 8.547e-13

Compute step by step.

First, 3 *5.568 = 16.704.

16.704 * 1e-5 = 1.6704e-4.

1.6704e-4 * 101325 = Let's compute 1.6704e-4 * 1e5 is 16.704, so 1.6704e-4 * 1.01325e5 = 16.704 * 1.01325 ≈ 16.91.

Wait, 101325 = 1.01325e5, so 1.6704e-4 * 1.01325e5 = (1.6704 * 1.01325) * (1e-4 * 1e5) = (1.6704 * 1.01325) * 10^(1) )

1.6704 * 1.01325 ≈ 1.6704 * 1 ≈ 1.6704 + 1.6704 * 0.01325.

1.6704 * 0.01325 ≈ 0.0221.

So total is approx 1.6704 + 0.0221 = 1.6925.

Multiply by 10^1: 16.925.

So now we have 16.925 * 8.547e-13.

Compute 16.925 * 8.547e-13:

16.925 *8.547 ≈ 144.5.

So 144.5e-13 = 1.445e-11.

So denominator is approximately 1.445e-11.

So now, d² = numerator / denominator = 4.62e-31 / 1.445e-11 = approx 3.20e-20 m².

Wait, because 4.62e-31 / 1.445e-11 = (4.62 / 1.445) * 1e-20 ≈
