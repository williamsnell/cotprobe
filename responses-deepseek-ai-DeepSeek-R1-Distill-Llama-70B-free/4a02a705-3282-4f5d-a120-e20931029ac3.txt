Alright, so I have this question about nonlinear resistors and whether they're voltage-controlled or current-controlled. Hmm, okay, I remember from my circuits class that resistors can have different types of relationships between voltage and current.

The question gives me the v-i relation as v(t) = (1/2)i²(t). Wait, so the voltage is proportional to the square of the current. That means v equals some constant multiplied by i squared. So the resistor's voltage depends on the current through it.

I think about what defines a voltage-controlled versus a current-controlled resistor. Oh right, a voltage-controlled resistor has its resistance determined by the voltage across it. Like, if v is the independent variable and i depends on v. But here, it's the opposite. The voltage is expressed in terms of current, so the current is the independent variable.

Wait, another way to think: if the equation is v = f(i), then the resistor is current-controlled because the voltage depends on the current. Conversely, if i = f(v), then it's voltage-controlled. So in this case, since v is a function of i squared, it's current-controlled.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option B says the resistor is current-controlled. Option F says voltage-controlled. So I think B is the correct answer. 

Other options: Option I says controlled by square of voltage, which isn't the case here. Option A is square root of current, no. E is cube of current, no. J says not controlled, but that doesn't make sense because the relation clearly exists. So yeah, the answer should be B.

The given v-i relation is \( v(t) = \frac{1}{2}i^2(t) \), where the voltage across the resistor depends on the square of the current. This indicates that the resistor's behavior is determined by the current flowing through it, making it a current-controlled resistor. 

Analyzing the options:
- **B** correctly identifies the resistor as current-controlled, which aligns with the given relationship.
- Other options, such as **F** (voltage-controlled) or **I** (controlled by the square of the voltage), do not match the equation provided.
- Options like **A**, **E**, and **H** introduce incorrect dependencies, while **J** incorrectly suggests no control mechanism.

Thus, the correct answer is:

B
