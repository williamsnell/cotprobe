Okay, so I've got this calculus problem here. It's about finding the area bounded by a parabola and two horizontal lines. Let's see, the question says the area is bounded by y = x², y = 1, and y = 9. Hmm, I need to calculate that area.

Wait, I remember that to find the area between curves, I probably need to set up an integral. But wait, should I integrate with respect to x or y? Because the boundaries are given in terms of y (y=1 and y=9), maybe integrating with respect to y would be easier. Oh right, when integrating with respect to y, it's often better to express x as a function of y.

So the parabola is y = x². Solving for x gives x = sqrt(y) and x = -sqrt(y). So between these two x-values for each y, from y=1 to y=9.

The area can be found by integrating the difference between the right and left functions with respect to y. Since the right function is x = sqrt(y) and the left is x = -sqrt(y), the difference is sqrt(y) - (-sqrt(y)) which is 2*sqrt(y). So the area A is the integral from y=1 to y=9 of 2*sqrt(y) dy.

Let me write that down: A = ∫ from 1 to 9 of 2√y dy.

Now, integrating 2√y. The integral of √y dy is (2/3)y^(3/2), because √y is y^(1/2), and the integral is (y^(3/2))/(3/2) )= (2/3)y^(3/2). So multiplying by 2, the integral becomes 2*(2/3 y^(3/2)) )= (4/3) y^(3/2).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the integral of 2√y is 2*(2/3 y^(3/2)) )= (4/3)y^(3/2)? Or wait, let me double-check. Because 2 is a constant factor. So ∫2√y dy = 2 ∫ y^(1/2) dy. The integral of y^(1/2) is (y^(3/2))/(3/2) )= (2/3)y^(3/2). So multiplying by 2 gives (4/3)y^(3/2). Yes, that's correct.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me think again. The integral of y^n dy is (y^{n+1})/(n+1) ), right. So √y is y^(1/2), so n=1/2. So the integral is y^{(3/2)} / (3/2) ) which is (2/3)y^{3/2}. So when I multiply by 2, the integral becomes (4/3)y^{3/2}.

So then the area A is [ (4/3) y^{3/2} ] evaluated from 1 to 9.

Calculating that, it's (4/3)(9^{3/2} - 1^{3/2}).

What's 9^{3/2}? The square root of 9 is 3, so 3^3 is 27. Similarly, 1^{3/2} is 1.

So substituting, A = (4/3)(27 - 1) = (4/3)(26) = (4 * 26)/3.

Wait, 26 times 4 is 104. So 104/3. Hmm, looking at the options, option H is 104/3. So that should be the correct answer.

Alternatively, maybe I could have approached this problem by integrating with respect to x instead. Let's think about that to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So y = x², and the horizontal lines y=1 and y=9. Wait, but if I integrate with respect to x, I need to find the x-values where y=1 and y=9. For y=1, x is sqrt(1)=1 and -1. For y=9, x=3 and -3. Wait no, the lines y=1 and y=9 are above and below the parabola.

Wait, actually, the area between y=1 and y=9 would encompass regions where y is greater than the parabola. So if I were to integrate with respect to x, I would have to find the area between x=-3 to x=-1, and x=1 to x=3, because between x=-1 and x=1, the parabola is below y=1, but wait no, the lines y=1 and y=9 are horizontal. So maybe it's better to use vertical slices, but perhaps it's easier to stick with y.

Wait, perhaps I should sketch the graph mentally. The parabola y=x² opens upward. The lines y=1 and y=9 are horizontal lines. The area bounded by these would be the region that's above y=1 and below y=9, but also between the parabola.

Wait, actually, no. The area bounded by y = x², y=1, and y=9 is the region where y is between 1 and 9, and for each y, x ranges from -sqrt(y) to sqrt(y). So the approach I took earlier was correct, integrating with respect to y from 1 to 9, using the horizontal slices, each of width 2*sqrt(y).

Alternatively, using vertical slices, I could integrate in terms of x. Let's see, but that might complicate things because I'd have to calculate the area between the parabola and the lines y=1 and y=9 as two separate regions.

Wait, let's try that approach to double-check. So for y between 1 and 9, the x ranges from -sqrt(9) to -sqrt(1), and from sqrt(1) to sqrt(9). So in terms of x, the limits would be from x=-3 to x=-1, and x=1 to x=3. But wait, for each x between -3 and -1, and 1 and 3, the upper boundary is y=9, and the lower boundary is y=x². So the area would be the integral from x=-3 to x=-1 of (9 - x²) dx plus the integral from x=1 to x=3 of (9 - x²) dx.

But since the function is even (symmetric about y-axis), I can compute twice the integral from x=1 to x=3 of (9 - x²) dx.

So let's compute that. The integral of (9 - x²) dx is 9x - (x^3)/3. Evaluated from 1 to 3.

At x=3: 9*(3) - (27)/3 = 27 - 9 = 18.
At x=1: 9*(1) - (1)/3 = 9 - 1/3 = 26/3.
So the integral from 1 to 3 is 18 - 26/3 = (54/3 - 26/3) = 28/3.
Multiply by 2 (since we have two symmetric regions): 2*(28/3) = 56/3.

Wait, that's 56/3, which is approximately 18.666. But earlier, when integrating with respect to y, I got 104/3, which is about 34.666. That's a discrepancy. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait a minute, this can't be right. There's a mistake here. Because when I calculated the area using y as the variable, I got 104/3, and using x as the variable, I got 56/3. They should be the same. So I must have made an error in one of the approaches.

Let me recheck the x approach. So when integrating with respect to x, the area is between x=-3 and x=-1, and x=1 and x=3. So the area is 2 times the integral from 1 to 3 of (9 - x²) dx.

Compute the integral: ∫(9 - x²) dx from 1 to 3.

Antiderivative is 9x - (x^3)/3.

At x=3: 9*3 =27; (3)^3 /3 = 27/3=9. So 27 -9 =18.

At x=1: 9*1=9; (1)^3/3=1/3. So 9 - 1/3=26/3.

So the integral from 1 to 3 is 18 - 26/3.

18 is 54/3, so 54/3 -26/3 = 28/3.

Multiply by 2: 56/3.

Wait, but earlier when integrating with respect to y, I got 104/3. So which one is correct?

Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the limits when using the y method.

Wait, when I integrated with respect to y, I set up the integral from y=1 to y=9 of 2*sqrt(y) dy, because for each y, x goes from -sqrt(y) to sqrt(y), so the width is 2*sqrt(y). The integral of that is correct, leading to 104/3.

But the x approach gives 56/3. So I must have made a mistake in that approach.

Wait, perhaps the limits when integrating with respect to x are not correct. Because the area bounded by y=1, y=9, and y=x² includes the regions where y is between 1 and 9, but perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, when integrating with respect to x, the area between the curves is from x=-3 to x=-1 and x=1 to x=3, but perhaps I should also consider the area between x=-1 and x=1 where y is between 1 and 9 but above the parabola?

Wait no, because the parabola y=x² at x=1 is y=1, and at x=0 is y=0. So between x=-1 and x=1, the parabola is below y=1, but the area bounded by y=1 and y=9 would only be the region where y is between 1 and 9. So perhaps the region between x=-1 and x=1 is not part of the area we're calculating. Because the area bounded by y=1, y=9, and y=x² would only include where the parabola is between y=1 and y=9.

Wait no, that's not correct. The area bounded by all three: y=x², y=1, and y=9. So perhaps the region is where y is between 1 and 9, but also bounded by the parabola. So in terms of x, that's from x=-3 to x=-1 and x=1 to x=3, as I originally thought.

Wait, but when I did the x integration, I got 56/3, which is about 18.666, but the y integration gives 104/3, which is about 34.666. There's a big difference here, so I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I set up the wrong integrals. Let me re-examine both approaches.

In the y approach: The area is the integral from y=1 to y=9 of (right x - left x) dy. Since for each y, x goes from -sqrt(y) to sqrt(y), so the width is 2*sqrt(y). So the area is ∫ from 1 to 9 of 2√y dy. That's correct.

Calculating that:

Integral of 2√y dy = 2*(2/3)y^(3/2) )= (4/3)y^(3/2).

Evaluated at y=9: (4/3)*27 = (4*27)/3 = 4*9=36.

Evaluated at y=1: (4/3)*1=4/3.

So the area is 36 - 4/3 = (108/3 - 4/3) = 104/3. So that's correct.

In the x approach: The area should be the same. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, when I set up the integral in terms of x, perhaps I didn't account for the entire area correctly. Because in the x approach, the area is the region between x=-3 and x=3, but subtracting the area under the parabola where y is less than 1.

Wait, maybe that's the mistake. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the area bounded by y=1, y=9, and y=x² includes two parts:

1. The area under y=9 and above y=x² from x=-3 to x=-1 and x=1 to x=3.

2. The area under y=9 and above y=1 from x=-1 to x=1.

Wait, that makes sense. Because between x=-1 and x=1, the parabola is below y=1, so the area between y=1 and y=9 is a rectangle of sorts.

Wait, let me think. So the total area would be the sum of two parts:

A1: The area between y=9 and y=x² from x=-3 to x=-1 and x=1 to x=3.

A2: The area between y=9 and y=1 from x=-1 to x=1.

So A1 is 2 times the integral from x=1 to x=3 of (9 - x²) dx, which we calculated as 56/3.

A2 is the area of a rectangle from x=-1 to x=1, and y=1 to y=9. The width in x is 2 (from -1 to 1), and the height in y is 8 (from 1 to 9). So area is 2 * 8 = 16.

So the total area would be A1 + A2 = 56/3 + 16.

Wait, 56/3 is approximately 18.666, plus 16 gives 34.666, which is exactly 104/3, since 104 divided by 3 is about 34.666.

Ah, so I see my mistake now. When I did the x integration earlier, I only accounted for A1, the area between y=9 and the parabola, but I forgot A2, the area between y=1 and y=9 where the parabola is below y=1. So the total area is A1 + A2 = 56/3 + 16 = 56/3 + 48/3 = 104/3.

So that's consistent with the y approach, which gave me 104/3 directly.

So the correct answer should be 104/3, which is option H.
</think>

To find the area bounded by the parabola \( y = x^2 \), and the horizontal lines \( y = 1 \) and \( y = 9 \), we can use integration. The problem can be approached in two ways: integrating with respect to \( y \) or \( x \). Both methods are analyzed below to ensure consistency.

---

### **Method 1: Integrating with respect to \( y \)**

1. **Identify the region**: For each \( y \) between \( y = 1 \) and \( y = 9 \), the corresponding \( x \)-values range from \( x = -\sqrt{y} \) to \( x = \sqrt{y} \). The width of the region at a given \( y \) is therefore \( 2\sqrt{y} \).

2. **Set up the integral**: The area is given by:
   \[
   A = \int_{y=1}^{y=9} 2\sqrt{y} \, dy
   \]

3. **Compute the integral**: The integral of \( 2\sqrt{y} \) is:
   \[
   \int 2\sqrt{y} \, dy = 2 \cdot \frac{2}{3} y^{3/2} = \frac{4}{3} y^{3/2}
   \]

4. **Evaluate bounds**: Evaluate \( \frac{4}{3} y^{3/2} \) from \( y = 1 \) to \( y = 9 \):
   \[
   A = \frac{4}{3} \left[ 9^{3/2} - 1^{3/2} \right]
   \]
   Since \( 9^{3/2} = 27 \) and \( 1^{3/2} = 1 \):
   \[
   A = \frac{4}{3} (27 - 1) = \frac{4}{3} \cdot 26 = \frac{104}{3}
   \]

---

### **Method 2: Integrating with respect to \( x \)**

1. **Identify the region**: For \( y = 9 \), \( x \) ranges from \( x = -3 \) to \( x = 3 \). For \( y = 1 \), \( x \) ranges from \( x = -1 \) to \( x = 1 \). The area is split into two parts:
   - \( A_1 \): The area between \( y = 9 \) and \( y = x^2 \) from \( x = -3 \) to \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \).
   - \( A_2 \): The area between \( y = 1 \) and \( y = 9 \) from \( x = -1 \) to \( x = 1 \).

2. **Compute \( A_1 \)**: The area is symmetric about the \( y \)-axis, so compute twice the integral from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):
   \[
   A_1 = 2 \int_{1}^{3} (9 - x^2) \, dx
   \]
   The antiderivative of \( 9 - x^2 \) is:
   \[
   \int (9 - x^2) \, dx = 9x - \frac{x^3}{3}
   \]
   Evaluate from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):
   \[
   \left[ 9(3) - \frac{3^3}{3} \right] - \left[ 9(1) - \frac{1^3}{3} \right] = \left[ 27 - 9 \right] - \left
