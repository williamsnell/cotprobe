Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the photoelectric effect. Hmm, I remember that the photoelectric effect involves electrons being emitted from a surface when light shines on it. The key thing is that there's a minimum frequency of light required for this to happen, and if the frequency is too low, no electrons are emitted, no matter how intense the light is.

The problem says that when the wavelength of the incident light is longer than 6500 Angstroms, the emission stops. So that must be the cutoff wavelength, right? Which corresponds to the threshold frequency for the material. I think the threshold wavelength is the maximum wavelength that can cause emission. So if light has a longer wavelength than that, it doesn't have enough energy per photon to eject electrons.

Wait, I should make sure. The work function is the minimum energy needed to eject an electron from the surface. So the threshold frequency is the minimum frequency needed, which corresponds to the maximum wavelength (since wavelength and frequency are inversely related via c = λν).

So the threshold wavelength λ0 is 6500 Angstroms. I need to convert that to meters because the Planck constant h is in joule-seconds, and the speed of light c is in meters per second. Oh wait, maybe I can work in Angstroms but convert to meters properly.

The wavelength given in the problem is 3900 Angstroms. So that's shorter than 6500, which means the light has higher energy. So photoelectrons will be emitted.

The question is asking for the maximum energy of the emitted electrons. The maximum kinetic energy of the electrons is given by the equation:

K_max = (hc/λ) - Φ

Where Φ is the work function. But another way to think is that Φ = hc/λ0. So substituting that in,

K_max = (hc/λ) - (hc/λ0) = hc (1/λ - 1/λ0 )

So I need to compute that.

First, let's get the values straight.

h is Planck's constant, which is 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s.

c is the speed of light, approximately 3.0 x 10^8 m/s.

But wait, the wavelengths are given in Angstroms. 1 Angstrom is 1e-10 meters. So 6500 Angstroms is 6500e-10 m = 6.5e-7 m.

Similarly, 3900 Angstroms is 3.9e-7 m.

Wait, no. Let me compute that correctly.

Wait, 1 Angstrom = 1e-10 meters. So 6500 Angstroms = 6500 * 1e-10 m = 6.5e-7 m. Yep. Same for 3900: 3.9e-7 m.

So now plug into the equation.

K_max = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) [ (1/(3.9e-7 m)) - (1/(6.5e-7 m)) ) ]

Wait, let me compute the terms step by step.

First, calculate hc: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Then compute 1/λ and 1/λ0.

1/λ = 1/(3.9e-7 m) ≈ 2.5641e6 m^-1.

1/λ0 = 1/(6.5e-7 m) ≈ 1.5385e6 m^-1.

Subtracting these two: 2.5641e6 - 1.5385e6 = 1.0256e6 m^-1.

Now multiply by hc: 1.9878e-25 J·m * 1.0256e6 m^-1 = approximately 2.037e-19 J.

Wait, wait. 1.9878e-25 * 1.0256e6 = let's compute that.

1.9878e-25 * 1e6 = 1.9878e-19.

Multiply by 1.0256: 1.9878 * 1.0256 ≈ around 2.037.

So K_max is approximately 2.037e-19 J.

But wait, the question asks for the energy in electron volts. So I need to convert Joules to eV.

1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So K_max in eV is (2.037e-19 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 1.271 eV.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.27eV, option I is 1.25, and option C is 1.20.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations because that's important.

Alternative approach: Compute using the formula K_max = (1240 eV·nm) (1/λ - 1/λ0 )

Because 1 eV = hc/(lambda in nm) when lambda is in nm. The value 1240 eV·nm comes from hc in eV and nanometers. Because hc is approximately 1240 eV·nm.

Wait, yes! That's a quicker way. So using 1240 eV·nm as the constant.

So λ is 3900 Angstroms, which is 390 nm. λ0 is 6500 Angstroms, which is 650 nm.

So K_max = 1240 * (1/390 - 1/650 ) eV.

Compute the terms:

1/390 ≈ 0.0025641 nm^-1.

1/650 ≈ 0.0015385 nm^-1.

Subtract: 0.0025641 - 0.0015385 = 0.0010256 nm^-1.

Multiply by 1240 eV·nm:

1240 * 0.0010256 ≈ let's compute.

0.001 * 1240 = 1.24.

0.0000256 * 1240 = 0.031744.

So total is 1.24 + 0.031744 ≈ 1.2717 eV.

Which is approximately 1.27 eV. So option A is 1.27 eV. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me recalculate the subtraction.

1/390 = 0.00256410256.

1/650 = 0.00153846154.

Subtracting: 0.00256410256 - 0.00153846154 = 0.00102564102.

Multiply by 1240: 1240 * 0.00102564102.

Let me compute this: 1240 * 0.001 = 1.24.

1240 * 0.00002564102 = 0.0317983.

Adding them: 1.24 + 0.0317983 ≈ 1.2718 eV.

Yes, so approximately 1.27 eV. So the correct answer is A.

To determine the maximum energy of the emitted electrons, we use the photoelectric effect equation:

\[
K_{\text{max}} = \frac{hc}{\lambda} - \frac{hc}{\lambda_0}
\]

where:
- \( h \) is Planck's constant (\( 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)),
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of the incident light (\( 3900 \, \text{Å} = 3.9 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \)),
- \( \lambda_0 \) is the threshold wavelength (\( 6500 \, \text{Å} = 6.5 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \)).

First, calculate \( \frac{1}{\lambda} \) and \( \frac{1}{\lambda_0} \):
\[
\frac{1}{\lambda} = \frac{1}{3.9 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 2.5641 \times 10^6 \, \text{m}^{-1}, \quad \frac{1}{\lambda_0} = \frac{1}{6.5 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.5385 \times 10^6 \, \text{m}^{-1}.
\]

Subtract these values:
\[
\frac{1}{\lambda} - \frac{1}{\lambda_0} = 2.5641 \times 10^6 - 1.5385 \times 10^6 = 1.0256 \times 10^6 \, \text{m}^{-1}.
\]

Now, calculate \( K_{\text{max}} \) using \( hc = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \times 3.0 \times 10^8 = 1.9878 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J·m} \):
\[
K_{\text{max}} = (1.9878 \times 10^{-25}) \times (1.0256 \times 10^6) \approx 2.037 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

Convert \( K_{\text{max}} \) from joules to electron volts using \( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \):
\[
K_{\text{max}} = \frac{2.037 \times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 1.27 \, \text{eV}.
\]

Thus, the maximum energy of the emitted electrons is approximately **1.27 eV**, which corresponds to option **A**.
