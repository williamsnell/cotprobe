Okay, so I've got this question about the Hopewell culture, and I'm a bit rusty on my archaeology, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says that the Hopewell were complex rank societies but not a state. Then it asks which element they lacked except for one. The options are A to D, and I need to find the exception.

Hmm, I remember that state societies typically have certain characteristics. I think the key here is to figure out what defines a state versus a complex rank society. From what I recall, states have formal governments with centralized authority, like bureaucracies. They also usually have urban centers, a permanent military, and monumental architecture. 

Wait, but the Hopewell weren't a state, so they must have lacked some of these. The question is asking which one they did have. So the options are either formal government, monumental earthworks, urban centers, or a permanent military.

I think the Hopewell are known for their earthworks. Oh right, like the Hopewell Culture National Historical Park has those big earth mounds. They built elaborate ceremonial mounds, so that fits with monumental earthworks. So option B is something they had, meaning the others are what they lacked.

Now, looking at the other options: formal government (A) would be something a state has, so Hopewell didn't have that. Urban centers (C) and a permanent military (D) are also traits of states, which Hopewell lacked since they weren't a state society. So the exception is B, monumental earthworks.

The Hopewell culture, while a complex rank society, lacked the characteristics of a state such as a formal government, urban centers, and a permanent military. However, they are notable for their monumental earthworks, which were large ceremonial mounds. These earthworks stand out as the exception to what they lacked compared to state societies.

Answer: B
