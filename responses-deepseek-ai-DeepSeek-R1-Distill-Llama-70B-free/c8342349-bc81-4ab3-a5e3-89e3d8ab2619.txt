Okay, so I've got this limit problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read the question again. It says that the limit of a_n as n approaches infinity is 1. So, lim_{n→∞} a_n = 1. And I need to find the limit of (a₁ + 2a₂ + ... + n a_n)/n² as n approaches infinity. Hmm, okay, so the expression is a sum where each term is k times a_k, and then divided by n squared.

I remember that when dealing with limits involving sums, especially when the sum involves terms that go up to n, sometimes using the concept of averages or Riemann sums can be helpful. But I'm not sure yet. Let's think about it step by step.

First, let me note that each a_k approaches 1 as k becomes large. So for large k, a_k ≈ 1. But for smaller k, a_k might not be exactly 1. However, since the limit as k approaches infinity is 1, the behavior for the terms where k is large will dominate the sum as n becomes large.

So the sum S = a₁ + 2a₂ + 3a₃ + ... + n a_n. I need to find S / n² as n→infty.

Wait, maybe I can split this sum into two parts: one for the terms where k is small, and the other for where k is large. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I can approximate the sum by replacing a_k with its limit, 1, for each term, and see what that gives me. But wait, that's probably not exact because the a_k's approach 1 but aren't exactly 1 for finite k.

Alternatively, maybe I can express S as the sum from k=1 to n of k a_k. Then, I can factor this sum in a way that relates to the average of a_k's or something similar.

Another thought: since a_k approaches 1, perhaps for large k, the term k a_k is approximately k*1 = k. So the sum S would be approximately the sum of k from k=1 to n. The sum of k from 1 to n is n(n+1)/2. So S ≈ n(n+1)/2 for large n.

So then S/n² ≈ [n(n+1)/2] / n² = (n² +n)/(2n²) = (1 + 1/n)/2. As n approaches infinity, 1/n approaches 0, so this limit would be (1 + 0)/2 = 1/2. So the limit would be 1/2, which is option A.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is rigorous enough. Because I'm approximating a_k as 1 for all k, but a_k might approach 1 but maybe not fast enough. So perhaps I need a better approach.

Let me think about using the Cesàro mean or something related to the average. Alternatively, perhaps using the Stolz-Cesàro theorem, which is useful for evaluating limits of sequences in the form of fractions where both numerator and denominator tend to zero or infinity.

Stolz-Cesàro theorem says that if we have two sequences a_n and b_n, where b_n is strictly increasing and unbounded, then lim a_n / b_n = lim (a_{n+1} - a_n) / (b_{n+1} - b_n), provided that the latter limit exists.

In our case, the numerator is S_n = sum_{k=1}^n k a_k, and the denominator is n². So let me define a_n as S_n and b_n as n².

Then, according to Stolz-Cesàro, if I can find lim (a_{n+1} - a_n) / (b_{n+1} - b_n}, that would give me the desired limit.

Let's compute a_{n+1} - a_n. That would be sum_{k=1}^{n+1} k a_k - sum_{k=1}^n k a_k = (n+1)a_{n+1}.

And b_{n+1} - b_n is (n+1)^2 - n^2 = 2n +1.

So the limit becomes lim_{n→∞} ( (n+1)a_{n+1} ) / (2n +1) ).

Since a_{n} approaches 1 as n approaches infinity, a_{n+1} approaches 1 as well. So we have:

lim ( (n+1)*1 ) / (2n +1 ) = lim (n+1)/(2n+1) = lim (n(1 + 1/n)) / (n(2 + 1/n) ) ) = (1 + 0)/(2 + 0) ) = 1/2.

So that's consistent with my earlier approximation. Therefore, the limit is 1/2, which is option A.

Another way to think about it: the sum S_n is approximately sum_{k=1}^n k *1 = n(n+1)/2, so S_n ≈ n²/2 + n/2. Then S_n /n² ≈ (n²/2)/(n²) )= 1/2, and the other terms become negligible as n→∞.

Hmm, but wait, maybe I should consider the error terms. Suppose a_k =1 + ε_k, where ε_k → 0 as k→∞. Then S_n = sum_{k=1}^n k(1 + ε_k) ) = sum k + sum k ε_k.

Sum k is n(n+1)/2, and sum k ε_k. What's the behavior of sum k ε_k as n→∞?

Well, if ε_k tends to zero, but how fast? For example, if ε_k = O(1/k), then sum k ε_k would be sum O(1), which converges, so the sum would be a constant. But if ε_k is larger, like 1/k^p with p <1, then sum k ε_k would be sum k^{1-p}, which for p<1 would diverge as n^{2-p}/(2-p). But that would contribute to the sum S_n.

Wait, but in our case, we don't know the exact behavior of a_k. We only know that a_k approaches 1 as k→∞. So to be safe, perhaps we can bound the sum.

Let me consider that for sufficiently large k, say k >= N, |a_k -1| <= some epsilon. So for k >= N, a_k =1 + δ_k, where |δ_k| <= epsilon.

Then sum_{k=1}^n k a_k = sum_{k=1}^N k a_k + sum_{k=N+1}^n k (1 + δ_k) )

= sum_{k=1}^N k a_k + sum_{k=N+1}^n k + sum_{k=N+1}^n k δ_k.

The first term, sum_{k=1}^N k a_k is just a constant with respect to n, because N is fixed.

The second term is sum_{k=N+1}^n k = sum_{k=1}^n k - sum_{k=1}^N k = [n(n+1)/2] - [N(N+1)/2].

The third term is sum_{k=N+1}^n k δ_k. Since |δ_k| <= epsilon, each term |k δ_k| <= epsilon k.

So the absolute value of the third term is <= epsilon sum_{k=N+1}^n k = epsilon [n(n+1)/2 - N(N+1)/2 ].

So putting it all together:

sum_{k=1}^n k a_k = [sum_{k=1}^N k a_k] + [n(n+1)/2 - N(N+1)/2] + [sum_{k=N+1}^n k δ_k ]

When we divide by n², we get:

[sum_{k=1}^N k a_k]/n² + [n(n+1)/2 - N(N+1)/2]/n² + [sum_{k=N+1}^n k δ_k]/n².

As n→∞, the first term [sum_{k=1}^N k a_k]/n² tends to zero because the numerator is constant and denominator grows as n².

Similarly, the second term [n(n+1)/2 - N(N+1)/2]/n² ≈ [n²/2 + n/2 - ... ]/n² ≈ (1/2 + 1/(2n) ) - ... → 1/2 as n→∞.

The third term [sum_{k=N+1}^n k δ_k ]/n² is bounded in absolute value by epsilon [n(n+1)/2 - N(N+1)/2 ]/n², which is approximately epsilon (n²/2)/n² )= epsilon/2. So as epsilon can be made as small as we like (since a_k approaches 1), the third term's contribution to the limit is negligible.

Thus, the overall limit is 1/2.

So the answer should be A: 0.5.

To solve the problem, we start with the given condition: 

\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = 1.
\]

We are tasked with finding the limit of the sequence:

\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_1 + 2a_2 + \dots + n a_n}{n^2}.
\]

### Key Steps and Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Sum**: The numerator is the sum \( S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n k a_k \). For large \( k \), \( a_k \to 1 \), so \( k a_k \approx k \). Thus, the sum \( S_n \) behaves approximately like \( \sum_{k=1}^n k \), which is \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).

2. **Approximation of \( S_n \)**: For large \( n \), \( S_n \approx \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \). Dividing by \( n^2 \), we get:

   \[
   \frac{S_n}{n^2} \approx \frac{\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}{n^2} = \frac{n^2 + n}{2n^2} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2n}.
   \]

   As \( n \to \infty \), the term \( \frac{1}{2n} \to 0 \), so:

   \[
   \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{S_n}{n^2} = \frac{1}{2}.
   \]

3. **Rigorous Justification Using Stolz-Cesàro Theorem**: To confirm the result rigorously, we apply the Stolz-Cesàro theorem. Let \( a_n = S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n k a_k \) and \( b_n = n^2 \). Then:

   - \( a_{n+1} - a_n = (n+1)a_{n+1} \),
   - \( b_{n+1} - b_n = (n+1)^2 - n^2 = 2n + 1 \).

   The limit becomes:

   \[
   \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_{n+1} - a_n}{b_{n+1} - b_n} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{(n+1)a_{n+1}}{2n+1}.
   \]

   Since \( a_{n+1} \to 1 \), we have:

   \[
   \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{(n+1) \cdot 1}{2n+1} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n+1}{2n+1} = \frac{1}{2}.
   \]

4. **Error Analysis**: To ensure the approximation is valid, note that \( a_k = 1 + \delta_k \), where \( \delta_k \to 0 \) as \( k \to \infty \). The sum \( S_n \) can be split into:

   \[
   S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n k a_k = \sum_{k=1}^n k (1 + \delta_k) = \sum_{k=1}^n k + \sum_{k=1}^n k \delta_k.
   \]

   The first term is \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \), and the second term involves \( \delta_k \), which becomes negligible as \( n \to \infty \). Thus, the dominant term is \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \), and dividing by \( n^2 \) yields \( \frac{1}{2} \).

### Conclusion:

The limit of the sequence is:

\[
\boxed{A}
\]
