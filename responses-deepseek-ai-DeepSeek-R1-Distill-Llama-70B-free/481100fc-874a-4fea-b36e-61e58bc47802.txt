Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about the Minoans and what they did during difficult times to appease the gods. Hmm, I remember that the Minoans were an ancient civilization on Crete. They had a rich culture with palaces like Knossos. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so let me think.

The question is asking what they did in periods of great difficulty and stress. The options are A through J, each suggesting a different action. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Let me go through the options one by one. Option A says they stopped all forms of art and music. I don't recall that being the case. The Minoans are known for their art, like the Bull-Leaping frescoes, so maybe they didn't stop that even in tough times.

Option B is fasting for long periods. I'm not sure if there's evidence of that. Maybe, but I don't remember specific practices about fasting.

Option C: built monumental structures. Well, the Minoans did build big palaces, but I'm not certain if they did this specifically during stressful times. Maybe building was a sign of prosperity rather than a response to stress.

Option D: sacrificed adults and occasionally children. Oh wait, human sacrifice does come up in some ancient cultures. I think the Minoans might have practiced some form of sacrifice. But wait, I also recall that the myth of the Minotaur involves the sacrifice of youths to the bull, which was in the Labyrinth at Knossos. But was that historical fact or just a myth? I'm not certain if the Minoans actually did human sacrifices, including children. Maybe that's more of a Greek myth thing.

Option E: burnt their own houses. That doesn't sound right. Why would they destroy their own homes to appease gods? Maybe in some rituals, but I'm not sure about the Minoans doing that.

Option F: abstained from sexual relations. I don't think I've heard that about the Minoans. They might have had different religious practices, but I'm not certain.

Option G: enacted strict laws. Maybe, but I don't recall specifics about legal changes during stress periods.

Option H: buried their possessions. I'm not sure. Sometimes people bury valuables during times of war or natural disasters to protect them, but was that a Minoan practice?

Option I: performed complex dance rituals. The Bull-Leaping is a dance, right? So maybe they performed such rituals, especially in stressful times to appease the gods. That sounds plausible. I think dance was a significant part of their culture and religion.

Option J: migrated to different regions. Migration could be a response to difficulty, like environmental issues or invasions. But the question is about what they did to appease the gods, not necessarily moving away.

So, putting it together, I think the Minoans might have performed rituals, possibly dances, to appease the gods. So option I. Alternatively, if they did sacrifices, option D. But I'm a bit torn between D and I.

Wait, the question is about what they did during great difficulty. I think in many cultures, when facing hard times, they might turn to religious practices. For the Minoans, their religion involved rituals, including dance. The Bull-Leaping dance was a ritual act, perhaps to honor the gods, especially the bull deity. So during stress, maybe they did more of these dances.

On the other hand, human sacrifice is a more extreme measure. Did the Minoans practice human sacrifice? I'm not entirely sure. From what I remember, there's some debate among historians. Some sources suggest that human sacrifice might have occurred, especially considering the myth of the Minotaur, but it's not conclusively proven. However, the Minoans are more famously known for their art and religious rituals rather than for human sacrifice.

So, considering that, I'm leaning towards option I: performed complex dance rituals. That seems more in line with what I know about their culture.

The Minoans were an ancient civilization on Crete known for their rich cultural practices, including art, dance, and religious rituals. During periods of difficulty and stress, many cultures turn to religious practices to appease their gods. The Minoans are particularly noted for their complex dance rituals, such as the Bull-Leaping dance, which was a significant part of their religious and cultural life. This practice likely served as a way to honor their deities and seek divine favor during challenging times. While there are debates about human sacrifice in Minoan culture, it is not as widely supported by historical evidence as their ritualistic dances. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the Minoans performed complex dance rituals to appease the gods.

Answer: I
