Okay, I need to figure out the correct answer to this question about how different animals obtain oxygen. The question is comparing earthworms, frogs, fish, and humans. Let me think about each one individually.

Starting with earthworms. I remember that earthworms are annelids, and they live in moist soil. Since they're in the ground, it's probably not gills they use because gills are for water. Oh wait, earthworms don't have lungs either. They must respire through their skin. Their skin is moist, which allows oxygen to diffuse into their bodies. So earthworms use skin respiration.

Next, frogs. Frogs are amphibians, so they live both in water and on land. When they're in water, they use gills as larvae, but as adults, they have lungs. But wait, do they still use their skin for respiration? I think frogs can absorb oxygen both through their moist skin and their lungs. So frogs use both skin and lungs.

Then, fish. Fish live in water and have gills. The gills extract oxygen from the water. So fish use gills for respiration. I don't think fish have lungs, except maybe some like the lungfish, but in general, it's gills.

Lastly, humans. Humans are mammals and we have lungs. We breathe air into our lungs where oxygen is absorbed into the bloodstream. So humans use lungs.

Now I need to look at the options and see which one matches.

Option H says: Earthworms respire through their skin, frogs use skin and lungs, fish use gills, and humans use lungs. That sounds right based on what I thought.

Let me check the other options to make sure. Option A says earthworms use gills, which is incorrect. Option B says earthworms and humans use lungs, which is wrong. Option C says all use gills, no. Option D: earthworms and humans use gills, no. E: earthworms use lungs, incorrect. F: earthworms and fish use skin? No, fish use gills. G: earthworms use skin and lungs? No, they only use skin. I: earthworms use gills, no.

So the correct answer is option H.

The correct answer is determined by analyzing the respiratory methods of each organism:

- **Earthworms** respire through their moist skin, as they lack both gills and lungs.
- **Frogs** are amphibians that use both their moist skin and lungs for respiration.
- **Fish** primarily use gills to extract oxygen from water.
- **Humans** use lungs to breathe air.

Option H correctly states: Earthworms respire through their skin, frogs use both skin and lungs, fish use gills, and humans use lungs.

Answer: H
