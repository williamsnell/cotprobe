Question:

A commissioner of a sports league was charged with embezzling funds by increasing the amount of his allocated travel expenses without the approval of a majority of the team owners. In accordance with the bylaws of the league's charter, the commissioner was required to obtain the approval of at least half the owners before raising his expense allocation. At trial, the commissioner seeks to testify that his predecessor told him that he had authority under the league's charter to raise his expense allocation. The commissioner's testimony is

Options:

A: admissible, to show the precedent set by the predecessor.
B: inadmissible, because it is second-hand information.
C: inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.
D: inadmissible, because the league's charter is the best evidence.
E: admissible, as it can prove the commissioner's innocence.
F: inadmissible, because the predecessor's statement cannot be verified.
G: admissible, to show that the commissioner lacked criminal intent.
H: inadmissible, as it is not relevant to the case.
I: admissible as evidence of the routine practice of an organization.
J: admissible, as it gives insight into the league's charter interpretation.

Okay, so I've got this evidence question in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by breaking it down.

The scenario is about a commissioner of a sports league who's been charged with embezzlement. He increased his travel expenses without the majority approval of the team owners, which the bylaws require. Now, at trial, he wants to testify that his predecessor told him he had the authority to raise his expense allocation. The question is whether this testimony is admissible or not, and under which option.

Hmm, I remember that hearsay is a big issue here. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted, and it's generally inadmissible unless there's an exception. So the commissioner is testifying about what his predecessor said. That sounds like hearsay because the statement is being used to prove that he had authority, which is the truth of the matter.

Wait, but is there an exception that applies here? Let me think about the exceptions. There's the exception for statements by a party opponent, but the predecessor isn't necessarily a party here. There's also the exception for statements against interest, but that doesn't seem to fit because the predecessor isn't testifying against himself.

Another thought: maybe it's about the state of mind. If the commissioner is trying to show that he believed he had authority, then it's not for the truth of the statement but for his state of mind. But wait, the statement's content is about having authority. So if he's testifying that his predecessor told him he had authority, he's trying to prove that he actually did have authority, which would make it hearsay.

Alternatively, could this fall under the "routine practice" exception? I think that's Federal Rule of Evidence 803(6), which allows records of regularly conducted activity. But that's for documents, not oral statements. So the commissioner's testimony about what his predecessor said orally wouldn't qualify under that exception.

What about the "former employee" exception? No, that's more for business records where the person is unavailable. Doesn't seem to apply here.

So, the statement is hearsay, and I don't see a clear exception that would allow it in. Therefore, the testimony should be inadmissible as hearsay without an exception.

Looking at the options, option C says it's inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception. That seems correct. Option B says it's inadmissible because it's second-hand, but that's a bit vague. Second-hand information can sometimes be admissible if it's not hearsay or falls under an exception.

Wait, another angle: the commissioner is testifying about his own knowledge or belief. But he's recounting the predecessor's statement to establish that he had authority. So it's being used for the truth, making it hearsay.

Also, option G says it's admissible to show he lacked criminal intent. Is that possible? Because if he thought he had authority, maybe he didn't have the intent to embezzle. But the problem is that the statement is still hearsay. So even if it's relevant to his intent, it's excluded unless it's not hearsay or falls under an exception.

Wait, could it be non-hearsay if it's offered to show the effect on the listener (the commissioner's belief)? That is, if the statement is being offered to prove that the commissioner believed he had authority, not that he actually did. Then it's not for the truth of the statement, so it wouldn't be hearsay.

Oh, right! Hearsay is when the statement is offered for the truth. If it's offered for effect on the listener, it's not hearsay. So in this case, the commissioner is trying to show that he believed he had authority because his predecessor told him so. That would be relevant to his state of mind, perhaps to negate intent.

So if the testimony is about what the predecessor said to show the commissioner's belief, then it's not hearsay. That would make it admissible. But if it's being used to prove that he actually had authority, then it's hearsay.

Looking back at the question, the commissioner is seeking to testify about the predecessor's statement. The purpose is to establish that he had authority. Wait, no, the question says he's trying to testify that his predecessor told him he had authority, which would be to show that he believed he had authority, possibly to negate criminal intent.

So, if the testimony is about his state of mind, it's not hearsay. But if it's to prove that he actually had authority, then it's hearsay.

But the question is a bit ambiguous. Let's see the options again.

Option G says it's admissible to show he lacked criminal intent. So that would be using the statement to show his state of mind, not the truth of the statement. Therefore, it's not hearsay.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. If the statement is offered to show that he believed he had authority, then it's admissible as non-hearsay. But if he's using it to prove that he actually had authority, then it's hearsay.

So the key is the purpose for which the statement is offered. The question says he's testifying that the predecessor told him he had authority. The use is to support his defense, probably that he didn't embezzle because he thought he had permission.

So in that case, it's about his state of mind, not the truth of the predecessor's statement. Therefore, it's not hearsay and admissible.

Wait, but if that's the case, then option G would be correct because it's about showing he lacked intent.

Alternatively, if the statement is being used to prove that he had authority, then it's hearsay and inadmissible under option C.

But the question is about what the commissioner is testifying. He's testifying that the predecessor told him he had authority. So the jury could infer that he believed he had authority, which would negate intent.

So in that case, it's non-hearsay and admissible under option G.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was hearsay. Now I'm confused. Let me think again.

Hearsay is when the statement is offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. If the statement is "I told you you have authority," and it's offered to show that the speaker gave permission, then it's hearsay. But if it's offered to show that the listener believed he had permission, then it's not hearsay.

So in this case, the commissioner is offering the predecessor's statement to show that he believed he had authority, which would negate criminal intent. Therefore, it's not hearsay and is admissible.

So looking at the options, option G says it's admissible to show that the commissioner lacked criminal intent. That would fit.

Wait, but other options: option A says it's admissible to show precedent. But that's not the right reason. Option I is about routine practice, which might relate to business records, but that's not the case here.

So I think the correct answer is G.

Wait, but another point: the statement is being made by the predecessor, who is presumably not available. But if the statement is not for the truth, then availability doesn't matter. So it's permissible.

So yes, the testimony is admissible to show the commissioner's state of mind, making option G correct.

The question revolves around the admissibility of the commissioner's testimony that his predecessor told him he had authority to raise his expense allocation. The key issue is whether this testimony constitutes hearsay and, if so, whether it falls under any recognized exception or serves a non-hearsay purpose.

Hearsay is generally inadmissible unless it falls under an exception. Here, the commissioner is testifying about the predecessor's statement, which could be considered hearsay if offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (i.e., that he actually had authority). However, if the testimony is offered to show the effect on the listener (i.e., that the commissioner believed he had authority based on the predecessor's statement), it is not hearsay. This distinction is crucial because the testimony's purpose determines its admissibility.

The commissioner is likely offering the testimony to establish his state of mindâ€”specifically, that he believed he had authority, which could negate criminal intent. This makes the testimony admissible as non-hearsay because it is not being used to prove the truth of the predecessor's statement but rather to demonstrate the commissioner's belief.

Option G aligns with this reasoning, as it states that the testimony is admissible to show that the commissioner lacked criminal intent. Other options, such as C, incorrectly classify the testimony as inadmissible hearsay without considering its non-hearsay purpose. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**G: admissible, to show that the commissioner lacked criminal intent.**

Answer: G
