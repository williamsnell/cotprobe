Question:

A 40-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of increased facial hair growth. Her last menstrual period was 4 months ago. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 26 kg/m2 . Her pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 130/82 mm Hg. Physical examination shows temporal balding and coarse dark hair on the upper lip and chin. Pelvic examination shows clitoral enlargement. Her serum testosterone concentration is increased. Serum concentrations of androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, and urinary 17-ketosteroids are within the reference ranges. Ultrasonography of the pelvis shows a 12-cm ovarian mass. Which of the following best describes this mass?

Options:

A: Fibroma
B: Mucinous cystadenoma
C: Clear cell carcinoma
D: Teratoma
E: Brenner tumor
F: Serous cystadenoma
G: Endometrioid tumor
H: Sertoli-Leydig tumor
I: Ovarian carcinoid
J: Granulosa tumor

Okay, so I have this medical question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it carefully.

So, the patient is a 40-year-old woman with a 6-month history of increased facial hair growth. Her last menstrual period was four months ago. Her BMI is 26, which is a bit overweight. Her physical exam shows temporal balding and coarse dark hair on the upper lip and chin. Pelvic exam shows clitoral enlargement. Her serum testosterone is increased, but androstenedione, DHEA, and urinary 17-ketosteroids are normal. The ultrasound found a 12-cm ovarian mass.

Hmm, her symptoms are pointing towards hyperandrogenism. The increased facial hair (hirsutism), male-pattern balding (alopecia), and clitoral enlargement suggest high androgen levels. The fact that her testosterone is elevated supports this.

Now, the other androgens (androstenedione, DHEA) are within normal ranges. Wait, DHEA is usually a marker of adrenal androgens, right? So if those are normal, maybe the source isn't the adrenal glands but something else, like the ovaries. So an ovarian tumor causing excess androgen production.

Ovarian tumors that produce androgens... Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors come to mind. Those are sex cord-stromal tumors, which can secrete androgens. Also, granulosa cell tumors are another type, but I think they are more associated with estrogen production. Wait, no, actually granulosa cell tumors can produce both estrogens and androgens, but more commonly linked to estrogen excess leading to endometrial hyperplasia or cancer.

Wait, but in this case, the patient's symptoms are androgen excess, so maybe Sertoli-Leydig tumor? Also known as androblastomas. These are rare, but they can cause virilization, which includes the symptoms she's presenting with.

Another possibility is an ovarian stromal tumor or a lipid cell tumor. But I'm not too sure about those. Alternatively, could it be a Leydig cell tumor? But those are more commonly found in the testes, I think.

Wait, let's think about the options given. The options are A through J, each a different ovarian tumor.

Looking at the options:

A: Fibroma - usually associated with estrogen production, like Meigs' syndrome. But they don't typically cause androgen excess.

B: Mucinous cystadenoma - these are epithelial tumors, typically benign unless they have malignant features. They are usually filled with mucin and don't typically produce hormones.

C: Clear cell carcinoma - another epithelial tumor, often associated with endometriosis and can produce various substances, but not specifically known for androgens.

D: Teratoma - these are germ cell tumors, can produce various tissues, but more known for producing AFP or other markers. They are more common in younger women.

E: Brenner tumor - transitional cell tumors, often solid and fibrous, usually not hormonally active unless they have a granulosa cell component.

F: Serous cystadenoma - another epithelial tumor, usually benign. Again, not typically associated with hormone production.

G: Endometrioid tumor - related to endometrioid carcinomas, which are similar to endometrial cancer. They can be associated with endometriosis but not commonly with androgen excess.

H: Sertoli-Leydig tumor - yes, these are known to produce androgens. They are part of the sex cord-stromal tumors.

I: Ovarian carcinoid - these are neuroendocrine tumors, can produce various substances like serotonin, but not typically androgens. They might cause flushing or diarrhea.

J: Granulosa tumor - these produce estrogen, but can sometimes produce androgens. They can cause precocious puberty in girls or endometrial hyperplasia in adults.

Wait, so between H and J. The patient's testosterone is elevated. Both Sertoli-Leydig and granulosa tumors can produce androgens. But Sertoli-Leydig tumors are more likely to produce significant amounts of androgens leading to virilization. Also, granulosa cell tumors are more estrogenic, though they can have some androgen production.

Another point: the pelvic exam shows clitoral enlargement, which suggests significant androgen effect. That's more in line with a tumor producing high levels of androgens.

Also, the ultrasound shows a 12-cm ovarian mass. Sertoli-Leydig tumors can vary in size, but they are often solid or have a mix of solid and cystic components. Granulosa cell tumors are typically solid and may have areas of necrosis or hemorrhage.

Wait, but the key thing here is the hormone levels. The patient has high testosterone, with normal DHEA and androstenedione. Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors produce testosterone because they have Leydig cells, which produce androgens. So that fits.

So the best answer here is H: Sertoli-Leydig tumor.
</think>

The patient is a 40-year-old woman presenting with symptoms of hyperandrogenism, including increased facial hair, temporal balding, clitoral enlargement, and elevated serum testosterone. Other androgens, such as androstenedione, DHEA, and urinary 17-ketosteroids, are within normal ranges, suggesting the adrenal glands are not the source of the androgen excess. The presence of a 12-cm ovarian mass on ultrasonography points to an ovarian tumor as the likely cause.

Ovarian tumors that produce androgens include Sertoli-Leydig tumors and granulosa cell tumors. Sertoli-Leydig tumors are sex cord-stromal tumors that can secrete significant amounts of androgens, leading to virilization, as seen in this patient. Granulosa cell tumors, while capable of producing androgens, are more commonly associated with estrogen production and are less likely to cause the degree of androgen excess observed here.

Given the patient's symptoms, elevated testosterone levels, and the presence of a large ovarian mass, the most likely diagnosis is a Sertoli-Leydig tumor. This tumor type is known to produce androgens and can cause the virilizing symptoms described.
