Okay, so I've got this question about Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Hmm, I remember that Maslow proposed different levels of needs, starting from the most basic to more complex ones. The question is asking about esteem needs and which needs must be partially met before moving on to the next. 

Wait, the question says: "esteem needs must at least be partially met before one is prompted to satisfy..." So I need to figure out what comes after esteem needs. Let me think. The hierarchy, as I recall, goes like this: physiological, safety, belongingness and love, then esteem, and finally self-actualization at the top. 

So, physiological are the basic needs like food, water, shelter. Then safety needs, like security and protection. After that, belongingness and love needs, which involve social connections. Then comes esteem needs, which include self-esteem, recognition, respect. And the highest is self-actualization, which is about realizing one's potential.

So the question is, which needs come after esteem? That would be self-actualization. So the answer should be A: self-actualization needs. 

Wait, let me double-check. The hierarchy is often shown as a pyramid. The lower levels must be fulfilled before moving up. So if someone is working on their esteem needs, the next step is self-actualization. So yes, the correct answer is A.

According to Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs, esteem needs must be at least partially met before one is prompted to satisfy self-actualization needs.
