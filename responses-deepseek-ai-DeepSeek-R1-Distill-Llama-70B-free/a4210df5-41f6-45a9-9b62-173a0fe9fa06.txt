Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about multiprogrammed systems and program sharing. Let me try to break it down and figure it out step by step.

The question is asking which conditions must be true for a single copy of a program to be shared by several users in a multiprogrammed system. The options are I, II, and III, and I need to determine which of these are necessary.

First, let's understand the key terms here. Multiprogrammed systems allow multiple programs to run at the same time by sharing the CPU. When programs can be shared, it means that only one copy of the program is in memory, and multiple users can use it without loading multiple copies. This is efficient because it saves memory and possibly time.

Now the options given are:

I. The program is a macro.
II. The program is recursive.
III. The program is reentrant.

I need to evaluate each one to see if it's a necessary condition for sharing.

Starting with option I: The program is a macro. Hmm, a macro is like a shortcut or a predefined set of instructions that can be expanded. I'm not sure if being a macro is necessary for sharing. In fact, I think macros are more about code expansion and might not relate directly to the ability to share a program. So I don't think I is a must-have condition.

Option II: The program is recursive. Recursive programs call themselves repeatedly until a base case is met. But how does that affect sharing? If a program is recursive, each user's execution might have its own stack and state. Wait, but if the program isn't reentrant, recursion could cause problems because the same memory is being used by multiple users. Oh, but the question is about what must be true. So if a program isn't reentrant, being recursive might cause issues. But does being recursive help in sharing? Not necessarily. So II might not be a necessary condition, but I'm not certain yet.

Option III: The program is reentrant. Reentrant code can be safely executed by multiple users at the same time. It means the program doesn't modify itself or have static data that would cause conflicts when multiple instances run. This definitely sounds like a requirement for sharing because if the code isn't reentrant, each user might interfere with others' data, leading to errors. So III must be true.

So, from this, III is necessary. Now, looking back at I and II, do they need to be true?

I don't think I (being a macro) is necessary. Macros are more about code substitution and don't directly impact whether the program can be shared. So I is probably not required.

What about II (recursive)? If a program is recursive, does that affect its ability to be shared? Not exactly. Reentrant code can be recursive as long as each call uses its own stack frame and doesn't share modifiable data. So, II isn't a requirement for sharing. The program can be non-recursive and still be shared if it's reentrant. Therefore, II isn't necessary.

Wait, but could a recursive program be non-reentrant? Suppose a recursive function uses static variables or modifies some global state. Then multiple users running it could interfere. So for a recursive program to be shared, it also needs to be reentrant. But the question is about what must be true, not what could be. So the program doesn't have to be recursive (II isn't required), but if it is, it must be reentrant.

So the only must-have condition is III.

Looking back at the options, the answer should be the one where only III is correct.

The options are A through J. Let me look at them:

Option J says III only. So the correct answer should be J.

In multiprogrammed systems, sharing a single copy of a program among multiple users requires careful consideration of the program's properties. Letâ€™s analyze the given options:

1. **I. The program is a macro**: A macro is a predefined set of instructions that can be expanded. However, being a macro is not a necessary condition for sharing a program. Macros are more about code expansion and do not directly impact the ability to share a program in memory. Therefore, this is not required.

2. **II. The program is recursive**: A recursive program calls itself repeatedly until a base case is met. While recursion can work in shared programs, it is not a necessary condition for sharing. A program can be non-recursive and still be shared effectively if it is reentrant. Thus, this is not a required condition.

3. **III. The program is reentrant**: Reentrant code can be safely executed by multiple users simultaneously without interference. This is a critical requirement for sharing a program because reentrant code ensures that the program does not modify itself or rely on static data that could cause conflicts between users. Therefore, this must be true.

From the analysis, the only necessary condition for sharing a program in a multiprogrammed system is that the program is reentrant. This corresponds to option **J: III only**.
