Okay, so I've got this problem here where a coach rounded the number of runners at a track meet to the nearest 10, and the rounded number is 400. I need to figure out which of the given options could be the actual number of runners. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that rounding to the nearest 10 means looking at the units digit. If the units digit is 5 or higher, you round up; if it's less than 5, you round down. So, for example, 395 would round to 400 because the 5 in the units place means you round up. But 384 would round down to 380.

The rounded number is 400, so the actual number must be in a range that rounds to 400. Let me figure out what that range is. If we're rounding to the nearest 10, the midpoint between 400 and the next ten (410) is 405. So any number from 395 up to 404 would round to 400. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Actually, when rounding, the range is usually from the lower half (like 400 - 5) up to the higher half. So for 400, the actual numbers would be from 395 up to 405, but I might be a bit confused here.

Wait, no, when you round to the nearest 10, the cutoff is at 5. So numbers from 400.0 up to 404.999... would round to 400 when rounded to the nearest 10. But wait, no. Wait, when you round 405, you look at the units digit. 405 has a 5, which is the cutoff. So 405 rounds up to 410. So for a number to round down to 400, it can't be 405 or higher. So the maximum number that would round to 400 is 404.999... So any number >=395 and <405 would round to 400 when rounded to the nearest 10.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me correct myself. If you have a number, say, 395, the units digit is 5, so you round up to 400. Similarly, 396 to 404 round to 400. But 405 would round to 410. So the actual number of runners must be between 395 and 404 inclusive if the rounded number is 400.

Now I'll look at the options provided:

A: 411 → This is higher than 404, so it would round to 410, not 400. So A is out.

B: 382 → This is below 395, so it would round to 380, not 400. So B is out.

C: 420 → This is way higher, would round to 420, so no.

D: 447 → Also way higher, rounds to 450.

E: 375 → This is below 395, so rounds to 380. No.

F: 397 → Let's see, 397 is between 395 and 404, so yes, it would round to 400.

G: 406 → Hmm, 406 is above 405, so would it round to 410? Because 406 is 40 tens and 6 units. So 406 is 40*10 +6, so when rounding to the nearest 10, the 6 is more than 5, so it would round to 410. Wait, but 405 is the midpoint between 400 and 410. So 405 and above would round to 410, so 406 is in that range. Therefore, 406 would round to 410, not 400. So G is out.

H: 435 → That's way higher, rounds to 440, so no.

Wait, let me double-check. When rounding, the rule is that if the digit in the ones place is 5 or higher, you round up. So 405 would round up to 410. So any number from 400 up to 404.999... would round down to 400. So 397 is within 395-404, so it would round to 400. 406 is 406, which is 40*10 +6, so 406 would round to 410. So F is a possible correct answer.

Wait, but what about option G:406. Let me confirm. 406 → 406 ends with 6, so when rounding to the nearest 10, you look at the 6. Since 6 is more than 5, you round up, so 406 becomes 410. So G is not a correct option.

So looking back at the options, the correct ones are F:397 and maybe others? Wait, let me check the other options again.

Option E is 375, which is below 395, so it would round to 380, so not 400.

Option B is 382, same as E.

Option D is 447, which is way higher.

Option C is 420, which would round to 420.

Option A is 411, which is 410.

Option G is 406, which is 410.

So the only option that falls into the 395-404 range is F:397. So the correct answer should be F.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Oh, wait, I might have missed another option. Let me look again. The options are:

A:411 → rounds to 410.

B:382 → rounds to 380.

C:420 → rounds to 420.

D:447 → rounds to 450.

E:375 → rounds to 380.

F:397 → rounds to 400.

G:406 → rounds to 410.

H:435 → rounds to 440.

So yes, only F:397 is within the range that rounds to 400. So the correct answer is F.

To determine which number could be the actual number of runners at the track meet, we need to understand the range of numbers that round to 400 when rounded to the nearest 10. Rounding rules state that if the units digit is 5 or higher, you round up; if it is less than 5, you round down. Therefore, the range of numbers that round to 400 is from 395 to 404 (inclusive).

Now, let's evaluate each option:

- **A: 411** → This is above 404, so it rounds to 410. Not valid.  
- **B: 382** → This is below 395, so it rounds to 380. Not valid.  
- **C: 420** → This is much higher, so it rounds to 420. Not valid.  
- **D: 447** → This is much higher, so it rounds to 450. Not valid.  
- **E: 375** → This is below 395, so it rounds to 380. Not valid.  
- **F: 397** → This is within the range of 395 to 404, so it rounds to 400. Valid.  
- **G: 406** → This is above 404, so it rounds to 410. Not valid.  
- **H: 435** → This is much higher, so it rounds to 440. Not valid.  

The only number that falls within the range of 395 to 404 and rounds to 400 is **397**.
