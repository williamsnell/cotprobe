Okay, so I've got this question about the balance of payments deficit. Hmm, I remember that the balance of payments has something to do with a country's international transactions. Let me think... The balance of payments includes all the money coming in and going out of a country. So, if there's a deficit, that means the country is spending more than it's earning, right?

Wait, the question is asking what a balance of payments deficit signifies. I think it's when the country's total payments exceed its total receipts. So, in simpler terms, the country is importing more goods and services than it's exporting. That would mean they're spending more on foreign stuff than they're earning from selling their own.

Looking at the options, let's go through them. Option I says "imported more than it has exported." That seems to fit because if imports are higher than exports, the country is spending more, leading to a deficit. 

But wait, is there another way to look at it? The balance of payments can also involve other factors like capital movements. But in basic terms, a deficit usually refers to the trade balance where imports exceed exports. So the country isn't earning enough from exports to cover its imports, leading to a deficit.

Other options: Option E says "lowered its official reserve position." I think when a country has a deficit, it might use its reserves to cover the shortfall, so this could be a consequence. But the question is about what the deficit means, not the effect. So E might not be the answer.

Option H is the opposite: exported more than imported, which would be a surplus. So H is out. Option A says taken in more money than sent, which would also suggest a surplus, not a deficit. So A is incorrect.

Options B and F talk about national income. I don't think a deficit directly means the national income has decreased or increased. National income is more about GDP, which isn't directly the same as the balance of payments.

Options C and J are about national debt. A deficit might lead to increased debt over time if the country keeps borrowing, but the question is about what the deficit is, not its long-term effects. So probably not C or J.

Option D is about equal exports and imports, which would balance, so no deficit.

Option G says increased official reserves, which would be the opposite if there's a deficit. So G is out.

So putting it all together, the deficit means the country has imported more than it exported, which is option I.

A balance of payments deficit occurs when a country's total payments exceed its total receipts, typically because it imports more than it exports. This means the country is spending more on foreign goods and services than it earns from exporting its own. Analyzing the options:

- **Option I** correctly identifies that a deficit means the country has imported more than it has exported.  
- **Option E**, while a possible consequence of a deficit (as reserves may be depleted to cover the shortfall), does not define the deficit itself.  
- Other options (A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J) either describe the opposite scenario, unrelated concepts, or long-term effects rather than the direct meaning of a deficit.

Thus, the correct answer is **I**.

Answer: I
