Question:

To improve the quality of rental housing within its boundaries, a city proposed an ordinance requiring all new and existing rental housing units to provide at least one full bathroom for each bedroom, plumbing and electrical hookups for a washer and dryer, and a covered parking space. A majority of the owners of existing rental housing in the city opposed the ordinance. They argued that it would dramatically decrease the number of lowincome rental housing units because owners would be unable to raise rents enough to recoup the investment required to comply. Without denying these contentions, the city enacted the ordinance. A plaintiff who owns low-income rental housing has sued the city, claiming only that the ordinance is unconstitutional on its face. Which of the following best states the burden of persuasion in this action?

Options:

A: The city must demonstrate that the ordinance is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, because it adversely affects the fundamental right of rental housing owners to use their property in the manner they deem most economically efficient.
B: The city must demonstrate that the ordinance is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, because it will have a substantial and disproportionate negative impact on low-income persons.
C: The plaintiff must demonstrate that the ordinance is not substantially related to an important state interest, because it requires some owners of rental housing to invest money that they will not be able to recoup from increased rents.
D: The plaintiff must demonstrate that there is no rational relationship between the ordinance and any legitimate state interest, because the ordinance regulates economic activity of a type normally presumed to be within state regulatory authority.

Okay, I'm trying to tackle this constitutional law question about an ordinance affecting rental housing. Let me break it down step by step.

So, the city passed an ordinance requiring all rental units, both new and existing, to have at least one bathroom per bedroom, plumbing and electrical hookups for a washer and dryer, and a covered parking space. The majority of existing rental housing owners opposed this, saying it would reduce low-income housing because they can't raise rents enough to cover the costs. The city enacted it anyway, and now a plaintiff is suing, claiming the ordinance is unconstitutional on its face.

The question is about the burden of persuasion in this case. So, I need to figure out what standard the court will use to evaluate the constitutionality of the ordinance.

I remember that when challenging the constitutionality of a law, the standard of review can vary. If it's a fundamental right being infringed, the court uses strict scrutiny. Otherwise, it's usually rational basis.

In this case, the ordinance is about housing regulations. The plaintiff is a low-income rental housing owner. The ordinance affects property rights, but property rights aren't considered fundamental in the same way as, say, free speech or religion. So strict scrutiny (which requires a compelling government interest) might not apply here.

Wait, but wait. There's also the issue of whether it affects a suspect class, like low-income people. If the ordinance disproportionately impacts them, maybe a higher standard applies. But I think economic regulations, even those affecting the poor, generally don't trigger strict scrutiny unless there's a fundamental right at stake.

So, the city's ordinance is an economic regulation, right? It's about housing standards and requirements. Under the rational basis test, the government only needs to show that the law is rationally related to a legitimate government interest. The plaintiff would have to prove that there's no rational basis.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the city must show a compelling interest because it affects property owners' rights. But I don't think property rights here are considered fundamental in a way that strict scrutiny applies. More likely, it's rational basis.

Option B suggests the city must show a compelling interest because of a substantial impact on low-income persons. But again, unless it's a fundamental right or a suspect class, strict scrutiny doesn't apply. Low-income isn't a suspect classification, so I don't think this is correct.

Option C states the plaintiff must show the ordinance isn't substantially related to an important interest. That sounds like intermediate scrutiny, which applies to things like gender discrimination. I don't think that's the case here.

Option D says the plaintiff must show no rational relationship, which aligns with the rational basis test. Since this is an economic regulation, the plaintiff would have the burden to show the ordinance isn't rationally related to a legitimate government interest.

So the correct answer should be D. The plaintiff must demonstrate that there's no rational relationship because the ordinance is a type of economic regulation that's usually subject to rational basis review.

The question concerns the constitutionality of a city ordinance imposing housing requirements on rental units, with the plaintiff challenging it as unconstitutional on its face. To determine the burden of persuasion, it is important to identify the appropriate standard of review. Since the ordinance regulates economic activity (housing standards) and does not implicate a fundamental right or a suspect class, the rational basis test applies. Under this standard, the plaintiff must demonstrate that there is no rational relationship between the ordinance and a legitimate government interest.

Option A is incorrect because the ordinance does not trigger strict scrutiny; property rights are not considered fundamental in this context. Option B is also incorrect because low-income status is not a suspect classification, so the ordinance does not require a compelling state interest. Option C is incorrect because intermediate scrutiny does not apply here; the ordinance does not involve gender or other classifications that would trigger this standard. Option D correctly reflects the rational basis test, which is the appropriate standard for evaluating this economic regulation.

D: The plaintiff must demonstrate that there is no rational relationship between the ordinance and any legitimate state interest, because the ordinance regulates economic activity of a type normally presumed to be within state regulatory authority.

Answer: D
