Options:

A: were more likely to drop out of the group.
B: rated the group as less interesting and enjoyable.
C: felt more alienated within the group.
D: felt more indifferent towards the group.
E: were less likely to contribute to group activities.
F: were more likely to assume leadership roles within the group.
G: were more likely to dislike fellow group members.
H: rated the group as more interesting and enjoyable.
I: were less likely to recommend the group to others.
J: experienced less satisfaction from group activities.

Okay, so I've got this psychology question to tackle, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about Aronson and Mills' study on the effects of initiation severity on group attitudes. Hmm, I remember this is related to some classic social psychology experiments. 

So the question says that Aronson and Mills looked at how the severity of initiation into a group affects the attitudes of the people who join. They compared women who went through a mild initiation versus a severe one. The options are about what happened as a result.

Wait, I think this is about cognitive dissonance. The idea is that when people undergo some kind of hardship to join a group, they might feel the need to justify that effort. So if the initiation is really tough, they might think the group is more worthwhile to make their effort seem justified. That would make them have a more positive attitude towards the group.

Let me think. So in the study, I believe participants who went through a more severe initiation ended up rating the group more highly. Because if you go through a lot to get into a group, you don't want to feel like it was all for nothing. So you convince yourself that the group is great, which reduces the dissonance between the effort and the outcome.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one where the severe initiation group had a better view of the group. Let's see the options again.

Option H says they rated the group as more interesting and enjoyable. That sounds right. The other options don't fit. For example, options A, E, I, etc., suggest negative outcomes, but I think the severe initiation leads to more positive feelings.

Wait, but I should make sure I'm not mixing this up with another study. I think Aronson and Mills did find that people who went through more severe initiations liked the group more. So the correct answer should be H.

The question examines the effects of initiation severity on group attitudes, specifically referencing Aronson and Mills' study. The study is rooted in cognitive dissonance theory, which suggests that individuals who endure a more challenging initiation will justify their effort by viewing the group more favorably. 

Analyzing the options, the correct choice aligns with the study's findings that participants who underwent a severe initiation rated the group as more interesting and enjoyable. This is consistent with the idea that individuals rationalize their effort by attributing greater value to the group. 

Thus, the correct answer is:

H: rated the group as more interesting and enjoyable.

Answer: H
