Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to calculate the interest on a loan. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The loan amount is $1,262.77, and it's made on March 15 and repaid on August 12. The interest rate is 8% per year. I think I need to find out how much time passes between these two dates because the interest depends on the time the money is borrowed.

First, I'll figure out the number of days from March 15 to August 12. March has 31 days, so from March 15 to March 31 is 31 - 15 = 16 days. Then April has 30 days, May 31, June 30, July 31, and then August 1 to August 12 is 12 days.

Wait, let me count each month separately. March: 16 days, April: 30, May:31, June:30, July:31, August:12. Adding them up: 16+30 is 46, plus 31 is 77, plus 30 is 107, plus 31 is 138, plus 12 is 150 days total. Hmm, wait, let me check that again. March 15 to March 31 is 16 days (including the 15th?), or is it 17? Wait, if you include both the start and end dates, maybe not. Let me think: from March 15 to March 31 is 31-15 = 16 days, but wait, March 15 is day 1, so day 16 would be March 30, and day 17 March 31. So wait, maybe I should calculate it as (31-15) gives 16 days left from the 15th to the 31st, but that's correct because 15th is included as day 1. So March has 16 days in this period.

Then April has 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, and August 12. Adding all together: 16 +30=46, +31=77, +30=107, +31=138, +12=150 days. So total of 150 days.

Wait, but sometimes when calculating time periods for interest, like in loans, do they include the end date? Like, if it's repaid on August 12, do we count up to that day or not? Because sometimes in interest calculations, the end date isn't counted. So maybe it's 149 days? Or perhaps I should think in terms of months and days. Alternatively, perhaps using the exact date difference is better.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula with the number of days. So, the formula for simple interest is I = P * r * t, where t is time in years.

So P is $1,262.77, r is 8% or 0.08. t is the time in years, which is 150 days.

Wait, but wait: 150 days is how many years? Since a year has 365 days, t = 150/365. Let me compute that. 150 divided by 365 equals approximately 0.4110 years.

So the interest I would be P * r * t = 1262.77 * 0.08 * (150/365).

Let me compute step by step. First, 1262.77 multiplied by 0.08. Let's calculate that. 0.08 times 1262.77. 

0.08 * 1200 = 96, 0.08 * 62.77 = about 5.0216, so total is 96 + 5.0216 = 101.0216.

Wait, more accurately: 1262.77 * 0.08 = let's compute it. 1262.77 * 0.08. 1262.77 * 8 = 10098.16, so divided by 100 is 100.9816. So approximately $100.9816.

Then multiply by t, which is 150/365. Let me compute 150/365. 365 goes into 150 zero times. 365 * 0.4 is 146, so 0.411... Let me compute 150 ÷ 365.

Well, 365 × 0.411 is approximately 150. So 0.411 approximately.

So 100.9816 * 0.411 ≈ let's see.

100 * 0.411 is 41.1, and 0.9816 * 0.411 is about 0.403. So total is approximately 41.503, so about $41.50.

Looking at the options, option E is $41.52, which is very close to this number. So maybe that's the correct answer.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me double-check the days between March 15 and August 12.

March: 15 to 31 is 17 days (since 31-15+1 =17? Wait, no, if you count the 15th as day 1, then 31 is day 17. So 17 days in March.

Then April:30, May:31, June:30, July:31, August:12.

So 17 +30=47, +31=78, +30=108, +31=139, +12=151 days.

Wait, that's a problem. Earlier I thought it was 150 days, but now it's 151.

Hmm, perhaps I should use the exact number of days. Let me recount.

From March 15 to March 31 inclusive is 31 -15 +1 =17 days.

Then April has 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, and August 1 to August 12 is 12 days.

So total days:17+30=47, +31=78, +30=108, +31=139, +12=151 days.

So the correct number of days is 151.

That changes the calculation. So t is 151/365.

So recalculate I = P * r * (151/365).

So 1262.77 * 0.08 = 100.9816, as before.

Then 100.9816 * (151/365) = let's compute 151/365 first.

151 ÷ 365 is approximately 0.4137.

So 100.9816 * 0.4137.

Let me compute that:

100 * 0.4137 = 41.37.

0.9816 * 0.4137 ≈ approx 0.406.

So total is 41.37 + 0.406 = 41.776.

So approximately $41.78.

Looking at the options, the closest is E: $41.52, but wait, perhaps my approximation is off. Let me compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 151/365 exactly and then multiply.

Compute 151 ÷ 365:

Well, 365 × 0.4 = 146. 151-146=5. So 0.4 + 5/365.

5/365 is approximately 0.0137.

So 0.4137.

Now, 100.9816 × 0.4137.

Let me compute this more accurately.

100.9816 × 0.4 = 40.39264.

100.9816 × 0.0137 = ?

Let's compute 100 × 0.0137 = 1.37.

0.9816 × 0.0137 ≈ approx 0.01345.

So 1.37 + 0.01345=1.38345.

So total is 40.39264 + 1.38345 = 41.77609, so approximately $41.78.

But in the options, E is $41.52, which is close but not exact. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the days. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the exact days using a different approach. Let me list the days:

March 15 to March 31: from the 15th to the 31st is 17 days (since 31-15+1=17).

Then April: 30 days.

May:31.

June:30.

July:31.

August:12.

So total days:17+30=47, +31=78, +30=108, +31=139, +12=151. So yes, 151 days.

So the calculation is correct as 151/365.

Wait, but the answer options don't have exactly $41.78. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: $45.67

B: $35.28

C: $53.60

D: $48.99

E: $41.52

F: $55.10

G: $32.34

H: $60.45

I: $50.23

J: $38.70

So E is $41.52. My calculation gave $41.78, which is a bit higher. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps, perhaps in the multiplication.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation would get closer to one of the options.

Let me compute 151/365 exactly as a fraction.

151 ÷ 365 = let's compute it.

365 × 0.4137 = 151 exactly? Let me check: 365 × 0.4137.

Well, 365 × 0.4 is 146. 365 × 0.0137 is approximately 5. So 146 +5=151. So yes, 0.4137.

So 100.9816 × 0.4137.

Let me compute it more accurately.

100.9816 × 0.4137 = ?

Let me break it down:

100 × 0.4137 = 41.37

0.9816 × 0.4137 ≈ ?

Compute 0.9816 × 0.4 = 0.39264

0.9816 × 0.0137 ≈ 0.9816 *0.01=0.009816, 0.9816 *0.0037≈0.00363.

So 0.009816 +0.00363=0.013446.

So total 0.39264 + 0.013446 ≈ 0.406086.

So 41.37 + 0.406086 ≈ 41.776.

So approximately $41.78.

But the closest option is E: $41.52, which is a bit lower. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me recount. Maybe the end date is not included. So if the loan is repaid on August 12, maybe we don't count that day. So instead of 12 days in August, it's 11 days.

Wait, but that depends on how the interest is calculated. Some methods count both start and end dates, others don't. Let me think: If the loan is made on March 15 and repaid on August 12, the period is from March 15 up to and including August 12, which would be 151 days. But perhaps in some cases, the end date is not counted. So maybe it's 150 days.

Wait, in that case, if I take 150 days, then t=150/365= approx 0.411.

So 100.9816 × 0.411 = ?

100 ×0.411=41.1.

0.9816 ×0.411≈0.4036.

So total is 41.1 + 0.4036≈41.5036, so about $41.50, which matches option E ($41.52).

So perhaps the correct number of days is 150, not 151. Maybe the repayment date is excluded. So the period is from March 15 to August 12, but not including August 12, making it 150 days.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the exact days using another method.

Wait, maybe using a date calculator approach.

March 15 to August 12.

March has 31 days, so from March 15 to March 31: 31-15 = 16 days.

Then April (30), May (31), June (30), July (31), and August 1 to August 12.

So 16 +30+31+30+31+12 = let me add them:

16 +30=46, +31=77, +30=107, +31=138, +12=150.

So that's 150 days.

Wait, so earlier I thought of March 15 to March 31 as 17 days, but now it's 16 days. So confusion arises whether the end date is included or not.

If the loan is made on March 15, then March 15 is day 1, and March 16 is day 2, up to March 31 being day 17. So the number of days from March 15 to March 31 inclusive is 17 days.

But when we subtract 15 from 31, we get 16 days. So depending on whether we include the starting day, the count changes.

So perhaps the correct way is to calculate the days as (end date - start date) +1.

Wait, the formula for the number of days between two dates is end - start +1 if both dates are included.

So from March 15 to March 31: 31 -15 +1 =17 days.

But when calculating the period from March 15 to August 12, including both dates, it's 151 days.

But if the repayment is made on August 12, perhaps that day is not charged interest. So the period would be up to August 11, making it 150 days.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think about it: when you take a loan on March 15, the first day is counted as day 1. Then each subsequent day adds to the count. So if you repay on August 12, that would be the last day you have the loan, so it's included. So the period would be 151 days.

But in some financial calculations, the day of repayment isn't charged interest because the money is paid back that day. So maybe you only count up to August 11, making it 150 days.

I think the correct approach is to include all the days from March 15 up to and including August 11, because on August 12, the money is repaid, so you don't owe interest for that day. So the period is 150 days.

So in that case, t=150/365.

So I = 1262.77 * 0.08 * (150/365).

Compute 1262.77 * 0.08 = 100.9816.

Then 100.9816 * (150/365) = ?

150/365 = 0.411.

So 100.9816 * 0.411 ≈ let's compute it precisely.

0.411 * 100 =41.1.

0.411 * 0.9816 = ?

Compute 0.411 * 0.98 = 0.40278.

Plus 0.411 * 0.0016 = 0.0006576.

Total is 0.40278 + 0.0006576≈0.4034376.

So total I ≈41.1 + 0.4034376≈41.5034, so approximately $41.50.

Looking at the options, E is $41.52, which is very close to this amount, considering rounding during calculations.

Wait, maybe I should calculate it more precisely without approximations.

Compute 150 ÷ 365:

150 ÷ 365 = 0.4110 (exactly, since 365 × 0.4110 = 150.0, because 0.4110*365 = (0.4*365) + (0.011*365) = 146 + 4.015 = 150.015, which is slightly over, so perhaps it's 0.41096.

Wait, let me compute 150 ÷ 365 precisely.

365 × 0.4109587 ≈ 150.

So t = 150/365 ≈ 0.4109587.

Now, compute 100.9816 * 0.4109587.

Let me compute this multiplication more accurately.

100.9816 × 0.4109587.

I can use a calculator approach.

First, 100 × 0.4109587 = 41.09587.

Then 0.9816 × 0.4109587.

Compute 0.9816 × 0.4 = 0.39264.

0.9816 × 0.0109587 ≈ 0.01077.

So total 0.39264 + 0.01077 ≈ 0.40341.

So total I = 41.09587 + 0.40341 ≈ 41.49928, which is approximately $41.50.

So the interest is approximately $41.50, which matches option E ($41.52). The slight discrepancy could be due to more precise decimal calculations or rounding during intermediate steps.

Therefore, the correct answer is E.
</think>

To calculate the interest on the loan, we use the simple interest formula:

\[
I = P \cdot r \cdot t
\]

Where:
- \( P = \$1,262.77 \) (loan amount),
- \( r = 8\% = 0.08 \) (annual interest rate),
- \( t \) is the time in years.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of days between March 15 and August 12
- **March**: From March 15 to March 31 is \( 31 - 15 = 16 \) days.
- **April**: 30 days.
- **May**: 31 days.
- **June**: 30 days.
- **July**: 31 days.
- **August**: From August 1 to August 12 is 12 days.

Adding these together:  
\[
16 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 12 = 150 \, \text{days}.
\]

Thus, the total time is \( t = \frac{150}{365} \approx 0.411 \, \text{years} \).

### Step 2: Calculate the interest
Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
I = 1262.77 \cdot 0.08 \cdot 0.411
\]

First, calculate \( 1262.77 \cdot 0.08 \):

\[
1262.77 \cdot 0.08 = 100.9816
\]

Then, multiply by \( 0.411 \):

\[
100.9816 \cdot 0.411 \approx 41.50
\]

### Step 3: Match the result to the closest option
The calculated interest is approximately \( \$41.50 \), which closely matches option **E: \$41.52**. The slight discrepancy is
