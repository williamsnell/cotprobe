Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a proton moving in a magnetic field, and I need to find its speed. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step. 

Alright, the problem says that a proton crosses at right angles a uniform magnetic field. The magnetic field strength is 1.0 weber per square meter. From the photograph, the radius of curvature of the proton's path is measured as 0.22 meters. I need to calculate the speed of the proton. The options are given from A to J, each with different speeds in meters per second.

I remember that when a charged particle moves perpendicular to a magnetic field, it experiences a force that causes it to move in a circular path. The magnetic force provides the centripetal force required for this circular motion. So the formula I think I should use here relates these two forces.

The magnetic force on a moving charge is given by F = q * (v × B). Since the velocity is perpendicular to the magnetic field, this simplifies to F = q * v * B. 

The centripetal force needed for circular motion is F = (m * v²) / r, where m is the mass of the particle, v is its velocity, and r is the radius of the circular path.

So setting these two forces equal because the magnetic force is the centripetal force: qvB = (mv²)/r.

I can cancel out the v from both sides, which gives qB = (mv)/r. Solving for v, I get v = (qB * r) / m.

Wait, wait, let me make sure I remember the formula correctly. Oh right, yeah, because when you have qvB = mv²/r, dividing both sides by v (assuming v isn't zero) gives qB = mv/r. Then rearranging, v = (qB r) / m.

So I need the charge of the proton, the magnetic field strength, the radius, and the mass of the proton.

The charge of a proton, q, is the elementary charge, which is approximately 1.6 x 10^-19 coulombs. The magnetic field B here is given as 1.0 Wb/m². The radius r is 0.22 meters.

The mass of the proton, m, I think is about 1.67 x 10^-27 kilograms. Let me double-check that. Yeah, I remember that protons are heavier than electrons by about 1836 times, and electrons are around 9.11e-31 kg, so 9.11e-31 * 1836 is roughly 1.67e-27 kg.

So plugging all these numbers into the formula: v = (q * B * r) / m.

Let me write down the values:

q = 1.6e-19 C

B = 1.0 T (tesla, which is Wb/m²)

r = 0.22 m

m = 1.67e-27 kg

So substituting:

v = (1.6e-19 C * 1.0 T * 0.22 m) / (1.67e-27 kg)

Let me compute the numerator first. 1.6e-19 * 1.0 is 1.6e-19. Multiply that by 0.22, so 1.6 * 0.22 = 0.352. So the numerator is 0.352e-19, which is 3.52e-20.

Wait, no, wait. Let's compute it as:

1.6e-19 * 0.22 = (1.6 * 0.22) * 1e-19 = 0.352 * 1e-19 = 3.52e-20.

Then the denominator is 1.67e-27 kg.

So v = (3.52e-20) / (1.67e-27) m/s.

Dividing 3.52e-20 by 1.67e-27... Let me think about the exponents. 1e-20 divided by 1e-27 is 1e7. Then 3.52 / 1.67 is approximately 2.11. So 2.11e7 m/s.

Wait, let me do a more accurate calculation. 3.52 divided by 1.67.

Let me compute 1.67 times 2 is 3.34. 3.52 minus 3.34 is 0.18. So 0.18 / 1.67 is about 0.107. So 2.107, approximately 2.11.

So 2.11e7 m/s. Looking at the options, let me check:

Options are:

A: 2.8e7

B:4.0e7

C:1.8e7

D:2.5e7

E:3.5e7

F:3.0e7

G:1.5e7

H:1.0e7

I:2.1e7

J:2.3e7

So I got approximately 2.11e7 m/s. The closest option is I: 2.1e7, which is 2.1 x 10^7 m/s.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake in the exponents or the multiplication.

Wait, 1.6e-19 times 0.22 is 0.352e-19, which is 3.52e-20. Then dividing by 1.67e-27.

So 3.52e-20 / 1.67e-27 = (3.52 / 1.67) * (1e-20 / 1e-27) )

1e-20 / 1e-27 is 1e7.

3.52 / 1.67 = let's calculate this precisely. 1.67 times 2 is 3.34. 3.52-3.34= 0.18. 0.18 / 1.67 = 0.1078. So total is 2.1078, approximately 2.108.

So 2.108e7 m/s. So around 2.11e7, which would be option I: 2.1e7 m/s.

Wait, but wait another thing—am I using the correct mass for the proton? Let me confirm. I remember that the proton mass is about 1.67e-27 kg. Yeah, that's correct. And the charge is 1.6e-19 C, right. Yes.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values. Let me think. The exact charge is approximately 1.602176634e-19 C. The mass of the proton is approximately 1.6726219e-27 kg.

So using more precise numbers:

v = (q B r) / m = (1.602176634e-19 C * 1.0 T * 0.22 m) / 1.6726219e-27 kg.

Compute the numerator: 1.602176634e-19 * 0.22 = 0.3522387e-19 = 3.522387e-20.

Denominator: 1.6726219e-27.

So 3.522387e-20 / 1.6726219e-27 = (3.522387 / 1.6726219) ) * 1e7.

3.522387 / 1.6726219. Let's compute this division.

1.6726219 * 2 = 3.3452438. That's less than 3.522387. The difference is 3.522387 -3.3452438 = 0.1771432.

So 0.1771432 / 1.6726219 ≈ 0.1059.

So total is 2.1059, approximately 2.106e7 m/s.

So about 2.106 x 1e7 m/s. So 2.11e7 m/s. The options are I: 2.1e7, J:2.3e7.

Wait, but my calculated value is 2.106e7, which is very close to 2.1e7. So the correct option should be I.

Wait, but let me think again about the formula. Did I miss any factor? Because sometimes in these formulas, especially with magnetic fields and moving charges, it's easy to mix up the direction or the formula.

Wait, the formula v = (qBr)/m, correct? Because when you set qvB = mv²/r, the v cancels, leading to v = (qBr)/m.

Yes, that's correct. So the calculation seems right.

So the answer should be option I: 2.1e7 m/s.

To calculate the speed of the proton, we use the relationship between the magnetic force and centripetal force. When a charged particle moves perpendicular to a magnetic field, the magnetic force provides the centripetal force for its circular motion. The relevant formula is:

\[
v = \frac{q B r}{m}
\]

Where:
- \( q = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C} \) (charge of the proton),
- \( B = 1.0 \, \mathrm{T} \) (magnetic field strength),
- \( r = 0.22 \, \mathrm{m} \) (radius of curvature),
- \( m = 1.67 \times 10^{-27} \, \mathrm{kg} \) (mass of the proton).

Substituting the values:
\[
v = \frac{(1.6 \times 10^{-19}) (1.0) (0.22)}{1.67 \times 10^{-27}}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:
\[
1.6 \times 10^{-19} \times 0.22 = 3.52 \times 10^{-20}
\]

Next, divide by the denominator:
\[
v = \frac{3.52 \times 10^{-20}}{1.67 \times 10^{-27}} = \left( \frac{3.52}{1.67} \right) \times 10^7
\]

Performing the division:
\[
\frac{3.52}{1.67} \approx 2.11
\]

Thus:
\[
v \approx 2.11 \times 10^7 \, \mathrm{m/s}
\]

Comparing this result to the given options, the closest match is:
**I: \( 2.1 \times 10^7 \, \mathrm{m/s} \)**.
