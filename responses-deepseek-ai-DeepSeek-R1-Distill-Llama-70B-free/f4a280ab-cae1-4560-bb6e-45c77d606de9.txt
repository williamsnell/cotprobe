Okay, so I've got this chemistry question about spontaneous reactions. Hmm, I need to figure out which option correctly indicates that a reaction is spontaneous. Let me think through each option carefully.

The question is multiple-choice, options A to J. Wait, no, the options are A to I. Let me look again.

The question is which of the following indicates a spontaneous reaction. Spontaneous reactions are those that can proceed on their own without external input. I remember that Gibbs free energy change, ΔG°, is a key factor here. Oh right, if ΔG° is negative, the reaction is spontaneous. But wait, let me think about all the possibilities.

Option A: ΔH° greater than zero. That means the reaction is endothermic. But an endothermic reaction isn't necessarily non-spontaneous. For example, if the entropy change is positive enough, the reaction could still be spontaneous at higher temperatures. So A alone doesn't indicate spontaneity.

Option B: ΔG° is greater than zero. Oh wait, no. If ΔG° is positive, the reaction is non-spontaneous under standard conditions. So B would mean it's not spontaneous. So B can't be the correct answer.

Option C: The reaction occurs without any input of energy. Spontaneous reactions do happen on their own, without external energy input. So C sounds correct, but I need to check the other options to be sure.

Option D: ΔS° greater than zero. Positive entropy change means the system becomes more disordered. A positive ΔS contributes to a negative ΔG, which would make the reaction spontaneous. But wait, ΔS alone isn't the only factor. It's the combination of ΔH and ΔS in Gibbs free energy equation. So yes, a positive ΔS is favorable, but only when considering ΔG. So D could indicate spontaneity if the conditions are right. But is it the definitive indicator?

Option E: ΔS° less than zero. Negative entropy change. That's unfavorable for spontaneity unless other factors compensate, like a very negative ΔH. So E might not indicate a spontaneous reaction on its own.

Option F: Keq greater than one. Keq is the equilibrium constant. If Keq is large, products are favored at equilibrium. But that doesn't directly tell us about spontaneity. A reaction can have a high Keq but require a lot of activation energy, meaning it's not spontaneous unless given energy. Wait, no—Keq relates to the position of equilibrium, not the spontaneity. Spontaneity is about whether the reaction proceeds as written without external input, which relates to ΔG. But when Keq is greater than one, the reaction is product-favored, which usually suggests a negative ΔG. So F might be an indicator. But wait, is there a direct link between Keq and spontaneity? I think Keq being greater than one means the products are favored, which aligns with a negative ΔG°, meaning spontaneous. So F could be a correct choice.

Option G: The reaction is exothermic. Exothermic means ΔH is negative. But again, it's the combination with entropy. So just being exothermic doesn't guarantee it's spontaneous. For example, if ΔS is very negative, the reaction might not be spontaneous. So G alone isn't sufficient.

Option H: At equilibrium, more products than reactants. This is similar to F, because more products would mean Keq is greater than one. This suggests the reaction is product-favored, which implies ΔG° is negative, so spontaneous. So H is also a possible indicator.

Option I: Keq less than one. That would mean more reactants at equilibrium, which suggests the reaction isn't product-favored. So I isn't correct.

So now I'm looking at options C, D, F, H as possible correct answers.

Wait, the question is about which indicates a reaction is spontaneous. Let's recap:

ΔG° determines spontaneity. If ΔG° < 0, reaction is spontaneous.

Looking at the options, which directly relate to ΔG°.

Option B says ΔG° is greater than zero, which would mean non-spontaneous. So B is incorrect.

Option B is out. What about option F and H?

Option F says Keq > 1. Keq is related to ΔG° via the equation ΔG° = -RT ln Keq. So if Keq >1, ln Keq is positive, so ΔG° is negative. So yes, Keq >1 implies ΔG° <0, meaning spontaneous. So F indicates spontaneity.

Option H: more products than reactants at equilibrium. That's exactly what Keq>1 means. So yes, H also indicates it.

Wait, but what about option C: reaction occurs without input of energy. That's the definition of spontaneous. So C is also correct.

Now I'm a bit confused because multiple options seem correct.

Wait, let me go through each option again.

The question is which of the following indicates a reaction is spontaneous. So, which options are correct indicators.

Option C: The reaction occurs without any input of energy. Yes, that's a direct definition of spontaneous. So C is correct.

But wait, let me think. Spontaneous reactions can proceed without external input, but they may require activation energy. So they can be slow, but still spontaneous. So C seems correct.

But the options could have multiple correct indicators. But in the options, only one is correct.

Wait, the options are:

A: ΔH°>0
B: ΔG°>0
C: reaction occurs without energy input
D: ΔS°>0
E: ΔS°<0
F: Keq>1
G: exothermic
H: more products at equilibrium
I: Keq<1

So, which indicate a spontaneous reaction.

ΔG°<0 is the key. So which options imply ΔG°<0?

Option B is ΔG°>0 → non-spontaneous, so incorrect.

Option C: reaction is spontaneous, so yes.

Option D: ΔS°>0 → possible, but not sufficient alone.

Option F: Keq>1 → implies ΔG°<0, so yes.

Option H: more products → same as Keq>1, so yes.

So both C, F, and H are correct. But wait, looking back, the answer options only have one correct choice.

Wait, but in the given options, does any of them directly state that ΔG° is negative? No, because none of the options say that. So perhaps the correct options are either C, F, or H.

But the question is asking which of the following indicates a reaction is spontaneous. So which of these are correct.

Option C is correct because a spontaneous reaction occurs without external input.

Option F is correct because Keq>1 implies ΔG°<0.

Option H is correct because more products at equilibrium imply Keq>1, which again implies ΔG°<0.

Wait, but the question is a multiple-choice with only one correct answer. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering the options.

Wait the options given are from A to I.

Wait, let me read the question again. The question is asking which of the following indicates a reaction is spontaneous.

So, the correct indicators are:

1. ΔG° <0 → but none of the options state that directly.

2. Keq >1 → option F.

3. At equilibrium, more products than reactants → option H.

4. Reaction occurs without external energy → option C.

So, all of C, F, H are correct. But in the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, but each option is a separate possibility. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the correct answer is option B is incorrect, and option B is ΔG°>0 which is non-spontaneous.

Wait, let me think about each option.

Option A: ΔH°>0 → Endothermic. Doesn't indicate spontaneity.

Option B: ΔG°>0 → non-spontaneous, so incorrect.

Option C: Reaction occurs without input → yes, that's spontaneous.

Option D: ΔS°>0 → favorable but not definitive.

Option E: ΔS°<0 → unfavorable.

Option F: Keq>1 → yes, because ΔG° is negative.

Option G: Exothermic → possible but not sure.

Option H: More products → yes, same as F.

Option I: Keq <1 → no.

So, the answer could be C, F, or H.

But looking back, the options are A to I, so the correct answer must be among them.

Wait, the question is asking which indicates that a reaction is spontaneous. So the correct indicators are:

- ΔG° < 0.

But none of the options state that, so I must look for implications.

Option C: If a reaction occurs without any input of energy, it's spontaneous. So yes, C is correct.

Option F and H: Both imply Keq>1, which implies ΔG°<0, so they are correct.

So the possible correct options are C, F, H.

But the question is a multiple-choice with one correct answer, so perhaps I need to pick which one is an indicator.

Wait, the options are:

A: ΔH°>0 → endothermic. Not necessarily.

B: ΔG°>0 → non-spontaneous.

C: reaction occurs without input → yes.

D: ΔS>0 → possible, but need to consider ΔH.

E: ΔS<0 → not favorable.

F: Keq>1 → yes.

G: exothermic → possible, but not sure.

H: more products → yes.

So, all three C, F, H are correct. But in the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C because it directly refers to the definition of spontaneity.

Alternatively, F and H also indicate a spontaneous reaction because they imply a negative ΔG.

But wait, the question is which option indicates a spontaneous reaction. So all three C, F, H are correct, but in the given options, perhaps only one is present.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B is incorrect, and others are correct.

Wait, the problem is that I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The key is that a spontaneous reaction has ΔG° < 0. So which of the options reflect that.

Option C: Reaction without input → yes, because ΔG° <0 means it's spontaneous.

Option F: Keq>1 → implies ΔG°<0.

Option H: More products → same as F.

So, the options C, F, H all indicate a spontaneous reaction. But the question is a multiple-choice question with only one correct answer. So perhaps the correct answer is option B is incorrect, and option C is correct.

Wait, perhaps only one of these is an option. But in the given options, all three are possible.

Wait, looking at the options again:

The options are A to I.

Wait, the correct answer is option B is non-spontaneous, so correct is when ΔG° is negative, which isn't directly an option. So perhaps the correct indicators are the other options.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F: Keq>1, because that directly relates to ΔG°<0.

Alternatively, option C is correct because it's the definition.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to reach a conclusion.

The question is in a multiple-choice format, so the correct answer must be among the options, and only one is correct.

I think the correct answer is option B is incorrect because it says ΔG°>0. The correct indicators are when ΔG°<0, which can be determined from Keq>1 or option C.

Wait, but the question is which of the following indicates a spontaneous reaction. So the correct answer is either C, F, or H.

Looking back, perhaps option C is correct because it's a direct definition of a spontaneous process.

Alternatively, I remember that a reaction is spontaneous if ΔG is negative, which is linked to Keq being greater than 1.

But the question is about which option indicates a spontaneous reaction. So, the correct answer could be F, H, or C.

Wait, but C says the reaction occurs without any input of energy, which is the definition of spontaneous. So C is correct.

However, let me think again. All spontaneous reactions can proceed without external energy input, but not all reactions that proceed without input are spontaneous if they require a catalyst. Wait, no, a catalyst doesn't affect spontaneity, just the rate. So C is correct.

So, perhaps the correct answer is C and F and H, but in the options, only one is correct. But the way the question is phrased, it's looking for any of the correct indicators.

Wait, the options given are:

A: ΔH°>0

B: ΔG°>0 → no

C: reaction occurs without input → yes

D: ΔS>0 → maybe

E: ΔS<0 → no

F: Keq>1 → yes

G: exothermic → maybe

H: more products → yes

I: Keq<1 → no

So, the correct answers are C, F, and H.

But the options are A to I, and each is a separate option. So the question is, which one is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is F and H, but looking at the options, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. The correct answer is option B is incorrect, and option C is correct because it directly states the definition of a spontaneous reaction.

So, the correct answer is C, F, and H? But I can't choose multiple.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B is incorrect, and option C is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F, because it's a direct measure of ΔG°.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach is to remember that for a reaction to be spontaneous, ΔG must be negative. The options that imply that are F (Keq>1 → ΔG<0), H (more products → Keq>1 → ΔG<0), and C (spontaneous by definition).

So, which of these is among the options?

The options are:

C: reaction occurs without any input → correct

F: Keq>1 → correct

H: more products → correct.

Wait, but the question is a multiple-choice question with only one correct answer. So perhaps the intended answer is F, because Keq>1 is a direct indicator of ΔG<0.

Alternatively, the intended answer could be C, as it's a definition.

I think I need to make a decision. The options are A to I, and the correct answer is either C, F, or H.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the most direct indicator. The most direct is ΔG°<0, but that's not an option. So the next is Keq>1, which directly relates to ΔG°<0.

So, the correct answer would be option F and H, but in the options, both F and H are present.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is which indicates a spontaneous reaction. So all three C, F, and H are correct, but the options list each as separate.

In a typical multiple-choice question like this, the correct answer is usually option B is wrong because it's ΔG>0, but the correct indicators are F and H.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F. Because Keq>1 is a solid indicator.

Alternatively, the correct answer is C, because it's the definition.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of the options again.

The options:

A: ΔH positive → not necessarily

B: ΔG positive → non-spontaneous

C: occurs without input → yes

D: ΔS positive → possible

E: ΔS negative → not

F: Keq>1 → yes

G: exothermic → possible

H: more products → yes

I: Keq<1 → no

So, the correct options are C, F, H.

But the question gives only one correct option.

Wait, perhaps the answer is F, because Keq>1 is a clear indicator.

Alternatively, the answer is H, because it's about the position of equilibrium.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach: think about each option.

Which of these is an indicator of a spontaneous reaction?

The correct answer is F and H, but looking at the options, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, I think the correct answer is F, because Keq>1 definitely indicates a spontaneous reaction under standard conditions.

Alternatively, option C is correct because it's the definition.

But I'm not entirely certain, but I think the correct answer is option B is incorrect, and C, F, H are correct, but in the options, perhaps only F is correct.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should pick option B as incorrect and F as correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F.

Wait, I think I'll conclude that the correct answer is option C, because it directly states the reaction is spontaneous, and F and H are consequences of it.

No, wait. The question is which indicates a reaction is spontaneous. So all three C, F, H are correct, but the options may have only one correct.

But I'm not sure. I think I need to make a decision.

The correct answer is option C, F, or H.

But the options are A to I, and in the context of multiple-choice, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F, because Keq>1 is a clear indicator. So the answer is F.

Wait, but another thought: The reaction being spontaneous (ΔG°<0) is also indicated by the reaction being product-favored, which is what Keq>1 and more products (option H) suggest.

In that case, both F and H are correct. But the question is a single-answer multiple-choice, so perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. I'm going to pick option C as correct because it's the definition, but I'm not entirely sure.

To determine which option indicates that a reaction is spontaneous, we analyze each choice based on the principles of thermodynamics and equilibrium:

1. **Option A: ΔH° > 0**  
   A positive enthalpy change (endothermic reaction) does not necessarily indicate spontaneity. Spontaneity depends on both ΔH and ΔS, as described by the Gibbs free energy equation. Thus, this option is incorrect.

2. **Option B: ΔG° > 0**  
   A positive Gibbs free energy change indicates a non-spontaneous reaction under standard conditions. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

3. **Option C: The reaction occurs without any input of energy**  
   This is a direct definition of a spontaneous reaction. Spontaneous reactions can proceed on their own without external energy input. Hence, this option is correct.

4. **Option D: ΔS° > 0**  
   A positive entropy change (increase in disorder) is favorable for spontaneity, but it is
