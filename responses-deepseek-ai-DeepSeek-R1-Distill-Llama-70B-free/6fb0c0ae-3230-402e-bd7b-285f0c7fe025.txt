Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating markup percentages. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question is about a C.B. radio that sells for $89.95. The store pays $65.05 for each. I need to find the percent markup based on the cost and also based on the selling price. Then, choose the correct option from A to J.

Wait, markup. Right, markup is the difference between the selling price and the cost, and then expressed as a percentage. But there are two ways to calculate it: based on cost and based on selling price. Oh right, sometimes this is confusing. Let me get that straight.

So, the formula for markup based on cost is: (Markup / Cost) * 100. And markup based on selling price is (Markup / Selling Price) * 100.

First, let me find the markup amount. Selling price is $89.95, cost is $65.05. So the markup is 89.95 minus 65.05. Let me calculate that. 89.95 minus 65.05 equals... 24.90. So the markup is $24.90.

Now, for the markup based on cost. So that's (24.90 / 65.05) * 100. Let me compute that. 24.90 divided by 65.05. Hmm, let me do the division. 24.9 / 65.05 â‰ˆ 0.3828. Multiply by 100 gives 38.28%. So that's about 38.28% markup on cost.

Next, the markup based on selling price. That's (24.90 / 89.95) * 100. Let me calculate that. 24.90 divided by 89.95 is approximately 0.2768. Multiply by 100 gives 27.68%. So 27.68% markup on selling price.

Wait, so the two percentages are 38.28% and 27.68%. Now I need to look at the options to see which one matches these two numbers.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 38.28%, 27.68%. That's exactly what I got. So option A is the correct one.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I compute the right percentages? I can recalculate just to be sure.

Markup based on cost: 24.90 / 65.05 = let me see, 65.05 times 0.3828 is about 24.90. Yep, that's correct.

Markup based on selling price: 24.90 / 89.95. Let me compute that again. 24.90 divided by 89.95. Let me think, 89.95 is about 90, so 24.9/90 is 0.2766..., which is about 27.66%, which I approximated as 27.68%. So that's right.

Looking back at the options, option A has exactly those numbers. So the answer should be A.

The problem involves calculating the percent markup based on both cost and selling price for a C.B. radio. The selling price is $89.95, and the cost is $65.05. 

1. **Markup Amount**:  
   The markup is the difference between the selling price and the cost:  
   \[
   \text{Markup} = \$89.95 - \$65.05 = \$24.90
   \]

2. **Markup Based on Cost**:  
   This is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Markup \% (Cost)} = \left(\frac{\$24.90}{\$65.05}\right) \times 100 \approx 38.28\%
   \]

3. **Markup Based on Selling Price**:  
   This is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Markup \% (Selling Price)} = \left(\frac{\$24.90}{\$89.95}\right) \times 100 \approx 27.68\%
   \]

4. **Matching the Options**:  
   The calculated values (38.28% and 27.68%) correspond to **Option A**.

Answer: A
