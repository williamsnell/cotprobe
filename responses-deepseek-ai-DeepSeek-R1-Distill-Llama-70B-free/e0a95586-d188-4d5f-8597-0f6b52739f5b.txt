Question:

A businessman living was an avid baseball fan who frequently traveled to a casino and placed wagers on baseball games. One October, his beloved baseball team was playing in the playoffs and he wanted to place a large bet on his team. He told one of his employees that he wanted to bet $10,000 on his team to win the championship, but that he did not have the time to travel to the casino to place the bet. He then told his employee that he wanted the employee to travel to the casino and place the bet for him. The businessman and the employee agreed that the employee would travel to the casino, place a $10,000 bet for the businessman and then immediately return. In exchange, the employee would be paid $500. The parties reduced this agreement to writing. After the agreement was signed, the businessman handed the employee $10,000 and a round-trip airline ticket. The businessman then told the employee that he would be paid $500 after the employee returned. The employee arrived the next day and immediately went to the casino. There he noticed that the marquis in the parking lot was unlit and covered in a banner that read, "Casino Temporarily Closed Due to Renovations. " Unable to reach the businessman by telephone, the employee placed the bet at another gaming establishment located next door to the casino. The following morning, the employee flew back and gave the betting receipt to the businessman. When the businessman saw that the bet had been made at another gaming establishment, he angrily told the employee, "I purposely directed you to wager that $10,000 at the casino. Since you failed to follow my instructions, the deal's off. " As a result, the businessman refused to pay the employee the $500. If the employee initiates suit for breach of contract, the court will most likely determine that placing the $10,000 wager at the other gaming establishment, rather than at the casino, constituted a

Options:

A: discharge by impossibility.
B: constructive condition precedent that was substantially performed.
C: modification.
D: material breach of contract.
E: minor breach of contract.
F: constructive condition subsequent.
G: discharge by impracticability.
H: breach of contract.
I: discharge by frustration of purpose.
J: anticipatory repudiation.

Okay, so I have this contract law question to tackle. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the scenario involves a businessman and his employee. The businessman wants to place a bet on his baseball team but doesn't have the time to go to the casino himself. So, he asks his employee to do it for him. They make a written agreement where the employee will go to the casino, place a $10,000 bet, and then return. In exchange, the employee gets $500. 

The businessman gives the employee the $10k and a round-trip ticket. But when the employee arrives, the casino is temporarily closed for renovations. The marquis is unlit and there's a banner about it. The employee can't reach the businessman, so he goes next door to another gaming establishment and places the bet there. The next day, he returns and gives the receipt to the businessman. But the businessman is angry because the bet wasn't placed at the casino as instructed and refuses to pay the $500. Now, the employee is suing for breach of contract.

The question is asking what the court would most likely determine the employee's action constitutes. The options are various contract law terms like discharge by impossibility, constructive condition precedent, material breach, etc.

Let me think about the key concepts here. The agreement was to place the bet at a specific casino. The employee didn't do that because the casino was closed. He went to another place instead. So, did the employee breach the contract?

I remember that a breach occurs when a party fails to perform as promised. But sometimes, the failure might be excused if it's due to impossibility or impracticability. Impossibility is when performance becomes physically or legally impossible. Impracticability is when it's not impossible but becomes extremely difficult due to unforeseen events.

In this case, the casino was temporarily closed. So, it's not impossible in the strict sense because the closure is temporary, but it's impracticable for the employee to wait or return later because he was supposed to place the bet immediately. Alternatively, the employee could argue that the casino's closure made his task impossible, but since he went to another place, maybe that's not the case.

Wait, but the employee didn't wait; he just went next door. So the casino's closure made it impossible at that time. But the contract was specific about the casino. If the casino was a specific requirement, then the employee's failure to go there might be a breach. 

Another angle is whether the instruction to go to the casino was a constructive condition. Conditions in contracts can be conditions precedent, which must be met before an obligation arises. If the employee's duty to place the bet at the casino was a condition precedent, then failing to do so might mean he didn't fulfill the condition, so the businessman's obligation to pay is excused.

But wait, the employee tried to perform but couldn't due to the casino's closure. So maybe it's a case of impossibility. However, since the employee went to another establishment, perhaps he should have waited or found another way. But given the time constraints (he was supposed to place the bet immediately), maybe it was impossible to perform as agreed.

Alternatively, if the casino's closure was unforeseen and made performance impracticable, the employee might be excused under the doctrine of commercial impracticability. But I'm not sure if that applies here because placing a bet elsewhere could still fulfill the main purpose, which was to wager on the team.

Wait, the businessman specifically told the employee to bet at the casino. So, perhaps the venue was a material term of the contract. If the employee didn't perform there, that's a material breach because it goes against the specific instruction. Material breach would allow the other party to terminate the contract.

But another thought: the employee substantially performed. He placed the bet as instructed, just not at the specified casino. So, is the location a minor detail or a major part of the contract? If the place was a minor detail, then it's a minor breach, but if it was essential, it's a material breach.

In this scenario, the businessman was specific about the casino, so maybe the venue was a key part of the agreement. Hence, the employee's failure to go there could be a material breach. Alternatively, the employee might argue that he did a substantial performance by placing the bet, just not at the exact location.

Wait, but the question is about what the court would most likely determine the employee's action to be. The options include material breach, minor breach, etc. 

I think the key here is that the employee didn't follow the specific instruction about the casino. Since the contract was to place the bet there, not doing so would be a failure to perform as agreed. If the casino was a specific term, then not performing there would be a breach. Whether it's material or minor depends on the importance of that term.

So, the businessman's refusal to pay is based on the employee not following his instruction. The employee tried but couldn't due to circumstances beyond his control. But he went to another place, so he performed but not exactly as instructed.

In contract law, if a party's performance doesn't conform to the terms, it's a breach. The question is whether it's a material or minor breach. If the location was a major part of the agreement, then it's material. 

Another angle: was there a constructive condition? Like, the employee's performance at the casino was a condition. If he didn't meet it, the condition wasn't fulfilled. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, the agreement was to place the bet at the casino. The employee didn't do that. So, perhaps the employee's action was a breach because it didn't conform to the contract terms. Whether it's material depends on the circumstances.

In this case, the employee was unable to perform at the casino due to its closure. So, maybe the closure made it impossible, but since he went elsewhere, it's not impossibility. Or perhaps the employee should have waited until the casino reopened, but he didn't because he was supposed to place the bet immediately.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Alternatively, the employee could argue that the casino's closure was an unforeseen event, making his performance impossible, thus discharging the contract. But he didn't claim impossibility; he just went to another place. So maybe the doctrine of impossibility doesn't apply because he found an alternative.

Wait, so the employee took it upon himself to go to another casino. The original contract specified the casino, so maybe that's a material term. Thus, the employee's failure to perform there would be a material breach, allowing the businessman to terminate the contract without paying.

So, looking at the options:

A: Discharge by impossibility — probably not, because the employee placed the bet elsewhere.

B: Constructive condition precedent that was substantially performed — maybe, if the condition was to bet at the casino, but he did bet, just elsewhere.

C: Modification — no, there was no agreement to change the terms.

D: Material breach — yes, if the location was important.

E: Minor breach — if the location wasn't that important.

H: Breach of contract — this is a broader term, but the question is about the specific type.

So, the question is about the nature of the breach. Since the employee didn't perform as instructed regarding the venue, which was a specific term, that would be a material breach. Therefore, D: material breach of contract.

Wait, but another thought: maybe the employee's action was a substantial performance. Substantial performance allows for minor deviations and still requires payment, minus any damages. But if the deviation was material, then it's a breach.

In this case, the employee deviated from the specific instruction about the venue. So, if the venue was a major part of the contract, it's a material breach. Otherwise, it's a minor breach.

The businessman was specific, so I think it's material. Thus, D is the answer.

The scenario involves a businessman and his employee who entered into a written agreement for the employee to place a $10,000 bet on a specific baseball team at a designated casino. The employee was to be paid $500 for this task. However, upon arrival, the casino was temporarily closed due to renovations, and the employee placed the bet at a neighboring gaming establishment instead. The businessman refused to pay the $500, claiming the employee failed to follow his instructions.

The key issue is whether the employee's decision to place the bet at a different location constitutes a breach of contract and, if so, the nature of that breach. The contract explicitly required the bet to be placed at the specified casino, which suggests that the venue was a material term of the agreement. The employee's failure to adhere to this instruction, despite placing the bet elsewhere, deviates from the agreed-upon terms.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Discharge by impossibility** — This does not apply because the employee was able to place the bet, albeit at a different location.
- **B: Constructive condition precedent that was substantially performed** — While the employee placed the bet, the specific venue was a material term, so this option is less likely.
- **C: Modification** — There was no agreement to modify the terms of the contract.
- **D: Material breach of contract** — The employee failed to perform as instructed regarding the specific venue, which was a key part of the agreement. This constitutes a material breach.
- **E: Minor breach of contract** — The deviation was significant because the venue was explicitly specified, making this option unlikely.
- **H: Breach of contract** — While this is a broader term, the question asks for the specific type of breach, which is better captured by "material breach."
- **F, G, I, J** — These options do not apply to the facts of the case.

The court would most likely determine that the employee's failure to place the bet at the specified casino was a **material breach of contract**, as the venue was a critical term of the agreement.
