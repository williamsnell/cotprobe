Okay, so I've got this logic problem to solve. It's about determining whether an argument is valid using indirect truth tables, and if it's invalid, finding a counterexample. Hmm, I remember that validity means that whenever the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. If I can find any situation where the premises are true but the conclusion is false, then the argument is invalid.

The argument given is:

P ⊃ (Q ∨ R)
(Q · S) ⊃ ~P
~(~Q ∨ R) 
/ ~P

Wait, the last line is the conclusion, right? So the premises are the first two lines, and the conclusion is ~P.

I think the way to approach this is by using an indirect truth table method. But wait, what's an indirect truth table? Oh right, instead of checking all possible truth values, we assume the premises are true and the conclusion is false, and see if that's possible. If that situation is possible, the argument is invalid because there's a counterexample.

So, the strategy is:

1. Assume all premises are true.
2. Assume the conclusion is false.
3. See if this situation is possible. If yes, the argument is invalid.

Let me break down each part.

First, the premises are:
1. P → (Q ∨ R)
2. (Q ∧ S) → ~P

Conclusion: ~P

So, let's assume the conclusion is false, which means ~P is false, so P must be true. Now, with P being true, let's see what the premises imply.

Looking at the first premise: P → (Q ∨ R). Since P is true, for the implication to hold, (Q ∨ R) must be true. So either Q is true, R is true, or both.

Now the second premise: (Q ∧ S) → ~P. Since we're assuming ~P is false (because P is true), the conclusion of this implication is false. For an implication to be true when the conclusion is false, the antecedent must be false. So (Q ∧ S) must be false. Because if (Q ∧ S) were true, then the implication would be false, which would make the premise false, which we can't have because we're assuming all premises are true.

So, (Q ∧ S) is false. Which means either Q is false, S is false, or both.

Now, let's put this together.

We have P is true.

From premise 1: Q ∨ R is true.

From premise 2: Q ∧ S is false.

So, we need to find truth values for Q, R, S that satisfy these conditions.

Let me try to find such values.

Let's consider possible cases.

Case 1: Q is false.

If Q is false, then from premise 1, since Q is false, R must be true to make Q∨R true.

Now, from premise 2, since Q is false, Q ∧ S is automatically false, regardless of S. So S can be either true or false.

So in this case, Q is false, R is true, S can be anything.

Let me pick S as true. So Q=false, R=true, S=true.

Let's check:

Premise1: P→(Q∨R). P is true, Q∨R is true (because R is true). So premise1 holds.

Premise2: (Q∧S) → ~P. Q is false, so Q∧S is false. The implication is true because an implication with a false antecedent is always true. So premise2 holds.

Conclusion: ~P is false (because P is true). So the conclusion is false.

So in this scenario, premises are true, conclusion is false. Therefore, the argument is invalid, and this is a counterexample.

Wait, but let me cross-verify. Let me see if there's another possibility.

Another case: Q is true.

If Q is true, then from premise 2, (Q ∧ S) must be false. Since Q is true, S must be false.

So Q=true, S=false.

From premise1, Q∨R is true. Since Q is true, R can be either true or false.

So let's pick R=false.

So Q=true, R=false, S=false.

Check:

Premise1: P is true, Q∨R is true (Q is true). So premise1 holds.

Premise2: Q∧S is false because S is false. So implication holds.

Conclusion: ~P is false (P is true). So conclusion is false.

So this is another counterexample.

Hmm, so there are multiple counterexamples. Now, looking at the options, each gives a different scenario.

Let me look at the options:

Option E: Invalid. Counterexample when P is true, Q, R, and S are false.

Wait, in that case, P is true.

Premise1: P→(Q∨R). Since Q and R are false, Q∨R is false. So P→false is false. So premise1 would be false, which contradicts our assumption that premises are true. So this can't be a counterexample.

Wait, but in our case, when Q is false, R must be true. So P is true, Q is false, R is true, S is whatever.

Wait, Option E says Q, R, S are false. So R is false. That would make Q∨R false, which would make premise1 false. So that can't be a counterexample because the premises wouldn't be true.

So Option E is not a valid counterexample.

Option I: Invalid. Counterexample when P and S are true and Q and R are false.

So P is true, S is true; Q and R are false.

Check premises:

Premise1: P→(Q∨R). Q∨R is false (both false), so P→false is false. So premise1 is false. Can't be a counterexample because we need premises to be true.

So Option I is not a valid counterexample.

Option A: Invalid. Counterexample when P, Q, R, and S are true.

So P is true, Q is true, R is true, S is true.

Premise1: P→(Q∨R) is true because Q∨R is true.

Premise2: (Q∧S) is true (both true), so (Q∧S)→~P becomes true→~P. But ~P is false (since P is true), so the implication is false. So premise2 is false. Hence, this can't be a counterexample because premise2 is false.

So Option A is invalid as a counterexample.

Option D: Invalid. Counterexample when P and R are true and Q and S are false.

So P=true, R=true; Q=false, S=false.

Check premises:

Premise1: P→(Q∨R) → true→(false∨true)=true→true, so premise1 holds.

Premise2: (Q∧S) → ~P. Q is false, so Q∧S is false. So the implication is true.

Conclusion: ~P is false (P is true).

So this is a valid counterexample. So Option D is possible.

Wait, but earlier I thought of a case where Q is false, R is true, S is true. So that would be P=true, Q=false, R=true, S=true.

Is this covered in any of the options?

Looking at the options:

Option H: P, R, S true; Q false.

Yes, that's exactly this scenario. Let me check Option H.

Option H: Invalid. Counterexample when P, R, and S are true and Q is false.

Wait, that's the case I thought of earlier.

So in that case, the premises are true, conclusion is false.

So Option H would be a valid counterexample.

Wait, but another option, Option D, is when P and R are true, Q and S are false. So in that case, premises are true, conclusion is false. So both options D and H would be valid counterexamples.

Wait, but the question says "if the argument is invalid, choose an option which presents a counterexample." So I need to see which of the options is a correct counterexample.

So let me check each option.

Option E: P is true; Q, R, S are false.

As before, that makes premise1 false, so not a counterexample.

Option F: P and Q are true; R and S are false.

So P is true, Q is true, R is false, S is false.

Premise1: P→(Q∨R) → true→(true∨false)=true→true, so premise1 holds.

Premise2: (Q∧S) → ~P. Q is true, S is false → Q∧S is false. So implication is true.

Conclusion: ~P is false. So this is a counterexample.

Wait, so Option F is also a possible counterexample.

Wait, but in this case, Q is true, S is false.

So let me check.

Option F: P and Q are true, R and S are false.

So, P=true, Q=true, R=false, S=false.

Premise1: P→(Q∨R) is true because Q is true.

Premise2: (Q∧S) is false (S is false), so the implication is true.

Conclusion: ~P is false. So premises are true, conclusion is false. So Option F is a valid counterexample.

Hmm, so it's possible that multiple options present a counterexample. But the question says to choose "an" option, so any correct one would do.

Wait, but let me check each option carefully.

Option E: P is true, Q, R, S are false. As discussed, premise1 would be false because Q∨R is false. So not a counterexample.

Option D: P and R are true; Q and S are false.

So P=true, R=true; Q=false, S=false.

Premise1: P→(Q∨R) → true→(false∨true)=true→true.

Premise2: (Q∧S) → ~P. Q is false → Q∧S is false. So implication is true.

Conclusion: ~P is false. So this is a counterexample.

Option D is a valid counterexample.

Option H: P, R, S are true; Q is false.

So P=true, R=true, S=true; Q=false.

Premise1: P→(Q∨R)=true→(false∨true)=true→true.

Premise2: (Q∧S)=false∧true=false. So implication is true.

Conclusion: ~P is false. So this is a counterexample.

So Option H is also a valid counterexample.

Option F: P and Q are true; R and S are false.

As above, that's also a counterexample.

So the options D, F, H all present valid counterexamples. But the question asks to choose one. Let me look back at the problem.

The argument is:

1. P → (Q ∨ R)

2. (Q ∧ S) → ~P

3. ~ ( ~Q ∨ R ) 

Wait, wait—no, the conclusion is ~P. So the argument is:

Premises:

P → (Q ∨ R)

(Q ∧ S) → ~P

Conclusion: ~P

Wait, but the third line in the problem is written as ~(~Q ∨ R). Wait, that's not the conclusion. Wait, the problem as written is:

The last line is the conclusion: ~P.

Wait, perhaps I misread. Let me check again.

The problem statement is:

P ⊃ (Q ∨ R)

(Q · S) ⊃ ~P

~(~Q ∨ R) 

/ ~P

Wait, no, the user wrote the argument as:

P ⊃ (Q ∨ R)

(Q · S) ⊃ ~P

~(~Q ∨ R) 

/ ~P

Wait, that can't be right. Oh, perhaps the third line is the conclusion. Wait no, the conclusion is ~P. So the premises are the first two lines, and the third line is the conclusion? Or is the third line part of the premises?

Wait, the way it's written is:

P ⊃ (Q ∨ R)

(Q · S) ⊃ ~P

~(~Q ∨ R) 

/ ~P

I think the first three lines are premises and the conclusion is ~P. Wait no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the third line is ~ ( ~Q ∨ R ), and the conclusion is ~P.

So the argument is:

Premise1: P → (Q ∨ R)

Premise2: (Q ∧ S) → ~P

Premise3: ~(~Q ∨ R)

Conclusion: ~P

Wait, that changes things. Oh no, I think I made a mistake earlier. The third line is a premise, not the conclusion. So the argument has three premises and a conclusion.

Wait, that makes more sense. So the argument is:

Premise1: P → (Q ∨ R)

Premise2: (Q ∧ S) → ~P

Premise3: ~(~Q ∨ R)

Conclusion: ~P

Oh, that's different. So the conclusion is ~P, and the premises are the first three lines.

So that changes everything. I need to reevaluate.

So the argument is:

1. P → (Q ∨ R)

2. (Q ∧ S) → ~P

3. ~(~Q ∨ R)

Therefore, ~P.

Wait, okay, so we have three premises. So when checking for validity, all three premises must be true, and the conclusion must be false.

So the approach is:

Assume all three premises are true, and the conclusion ~P is false (so P is true). Then see if that's possible. If yes, the argument is invalid.

So let's proceed.

Assume:

Premise1: P → (Q∨R) is true.

Premise2: (Q∧S) → ~P is true.

Premise3: ~(~Q ∨ R) is true.

Conclusion: ~P is false → P is true.

So, from conclusion being false, P is true.

Now, let's analyze each premise with P being true.

Premise1: P → (Q∨R) is true. Since P is true, Q∨R must be true. So Q∨R is true.

Premise3: ~(~Q ∨ R) is true. So, ~Q ∨ R must be false. Because ~(~Q ∨ R) is equivalent to Q ∧ ~R.

So, ~Q ∨ R is false → Q is true and R is false.

Because for ~Q ∨ R to be false, both ~Q must be false (so Q is true) and R must be false.

So from premise3: Q is true, R is false.

Now, from premise1, Q∨R is true. But since R is false, Q must be true. Which aligns with premise3.

So, Q is true, R is false.

Now, let's look at premise2: (Q ∧ S) → ~P.

Since P is true, ~P is false. So the implication (Q ∧ S) → ~P is equivalent to ~(Q ∧ S) ∨ ~P. Since ~P is false, this simplifies to ~(Q ∧ S). So for premise2 to be true, ~(Q ∧ S) must be true, which means Q ∧ S is false. So either Q is false, or S is false, or both.

But from premise3, we know Q is true. So Q is true, so for Q ∧ S to be false, S must be false.

So S must be false.

Putting it all together:

P is true.

Q is true.

R is false.

S is false.

Now, let's check all premises:

Premise1: P → (Q∨R) → true → (true ∨ false) → true → true. So premise1 holds.

Premise2: (Q ∧ S) → ~P → (true ∧ false) → false → ~P (which is false). So the implication is true because the antecedent is false. So premise2 holds.

Premise3: ~(~Q ∨ R) → ~ (false ∨ false) → ~ (false) → true. So premise3 holds.

Conclusion: ~P is false. So the conclusion is false.

Wait, so in this scenario, all premises are true, and the conclusion is false. So this is a counterexample, making the argument invalid.

So the counterexample is when P is true, Q is true, R is false, S is false.

Looking at the options, is there an option that matches this?

Option F: Invalid. Counterexample when P and Q are true and R and S are false.

Yes, that's exactly our scenario.

So the correct answer would be option F.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Option F says P and Q are true; R and S are false.

So P=true, Q=true, R=false, S=false.

Let me verify all premises:

1. P → (Q∨R): true → (true∨false)=true. So implication is true.

2. (Q∧S) → ~P: (true ∧ false) → false → ~P (false). So the implication is true because the antecedent is false.

3. ~(~Q ∨ R): ~(false ∨ false)= ~(false)=true.

Conclusion: ~P is false.

Yes, so this is a valid counterexample.

So the argument is invalid because there's a situation where all premises are true, but the conclusion is false.

So the correct option is F.

Wait, but earlier I thought that when I considered only two premises, but now that there's a third premise, the situation changes.

So the correct answer is Option F.
</think>

To determine the validity of the argument, we analyze whether the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument is as follows:

1. **Premises**:
   - \( P \rightarrow (Q \lor R) \)
   - \( (Q \land S) \rightarrow \neg P \)
   - \( \neg(\neg Q \lor R) \)

2. **Conclusion**:
   - \( \neg P \)

### Approach
To test the validity, we assume the premises are true and the conclusion is false. This is the indirect truth table method. Specifically:
- Assume \( \neg P \) is false, so \( P \) is true.
- Analyze the implications of this assumption on the premises.

### Analysis
1. **From \( P \rightarrow (Q \lor R) \)**:
   - Since \( P \) is true, \( Q \lor R \) must also be true. Thus, at least one of \( Q \) or \( R \) must be true.

2. **From \( (Q \land S) \rightarrow \neg P \)**:
   - Since \( \neg P \) is false (because \( P \) is true), the antecedent \( Q \land S \) must be false. This means either \( Q \) is false, \( S \) is false, or both.

3. **From \( \neg
