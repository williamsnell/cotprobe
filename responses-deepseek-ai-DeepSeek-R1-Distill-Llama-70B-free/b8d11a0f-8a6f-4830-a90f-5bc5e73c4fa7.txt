Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because geometry can be tricky sometimes. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The problem says: In triangle ACD, point B is on side AC, and point E is on side AD. We're given that AB is 3 units, AC is 5 units, CD is 3.5 units, and ED is 3 units. Also, EB is parallel to DC. We need to find the length of AD. The options are from A to J, with various numbers.

Hmm, okay. Let me visualize triangle ACD first. So, points A, C, D. B is somewhere on AC, and E is on AD. EB is parallel to DC. That's an important clue because when lines are parallel, we can sometimes use similar triangles or some proportionality.

Given lengths: AB is 3, AC is 5. So since AB is part of AC, the length from B to C must be AC minus AB. That would be 5 - 3 = 2 units. So BC is 2 units.

We also know CD is 3.5 units, and ED is 3 units. Wait, CD is a side of the triangle, right? So CD is 3.5. ED is 3, so from E to D is 3 units. So E is a point on AD such that ED is 3. So the length from A to E would be AD minus ED, which is AD - 3. Hmm.

Since EB is parallel to DC, maybe the triangles AEB and ADC are similar. Wait, because EB || DC, by the basic proportionality theorem (also called Thales' theorem), the line EB divides sides AC and AD proportionally. So the ratio of AB to AC should be the same as the ratio of AE to AD.

Wait, let me think about that again. If a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle, it divides the other two sides proportionally. So in triangle ACD, EB is drawn parallel to DC. So the sides being divided are AC and AD. So the ratio of AB/AC should equal AE/AD.

So AB is 3, AC is 5. So AB/AC = 3/5. That ratio should be equal to AE/AD. Let me denote AD as x. Then AE is x - 3, since ED is 3 and E is on AD. So putting it together:

AB/AC = AE/AD
3/5 = (x - 3)/x

Let me solve for x.

Cross-multiplying: 3x = 5(x - 3)
3x = 5x -15
Bringing terms together: 3x -5x = -15
-2x = -15
Divide both sides by -2: x = 15/2 = 7.5

Wait, but looking at the options, 7.5 is option H. But wait, let me double-check in case I messed up somewhere.

Wait, wait, hold on. Let me think about the triangles again. So EB is parallel to DC. So in triangle ACD, EB is a line cutting AC at B and AD at E, and EB || DC. So the ratio should be AB/AC = AE/AD.

Yes, that's correct. So AB is 3, AC is 5. So the ratio is 3/5. So AE is (3/5)*AD. But wait, AE is AD - ED. Because E is on AD, and ED is 3, so AE is AD - 3.

So 3/5 = (AD -3)/AD. Let me write that as an equation:

3/5 = (x - 3)/x

Cross-multiplying: 3x = 5x -15 → 3x-5x = -15 → -2x = -15 → x=7.5.

Hmm, so that would make AD 7.5 units, which is option H. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the setup.

Wait, another approach: since EB is parallel to DC, triangle AEB is similar to triangle ADC. Because all corresponding angles are equal. So the ratio of sides should be the same.

So in triangle AEB and ADC:

AB corresponds to AC, AE corresponds to AD, and EB corresponds to DC.

Wait, no, wait: in similar triangles, the sides correspond based on the order. So AEB ~ ADC? Or is it AEB ~ something else?

Wait, maybe I got the correspondence wrong. Let me think: EB is parallel to DC, so angle at A is common, and the other angles should be equal as well. So yes, triangle AEB is similar to triangle ADC by AA similarity.

So the ratio is AB/AC = AE/AD = EB/DC.

We know AB=3, AC=5, so the ratio is 3/5. So AE/AD = 3/5. So AE = (3/5)*AD. But AE is AD - ED. Since ED=3, AE = AD -3.

So (3/5)*AD = AD -3.

Let me write that equation:

(3/5) x = x - 3

Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate denominators:

3x = 5x -15

Subtract 5x from both sides:

-2x = -15 → x= 15/2 =7.5.

Same result as before. So AD is 7.5, which is option H.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when I set up ratios, I might mix up which part is which. Let me just confirm that the ratio is AB/AC = AE/AD. Yes, because EB is parallel to DC, so the lines are cutting the sides proportionally.

Alternatively, I could think in terms of similar triangles and the ratios of corresponding sides.

Another way to approach this is using coordinate geometry. Let me try to assign coordinates to the points and see if I get the same answer.

Let me place point A at (0,0), point C at (5,0) because AC is 5 units. Then point B is 3 units from A along AC, so B is at (3,0). Now, point D is somewhere in the plane; CD is 3.5 units long. Let me assume point D is at (5, y), but wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to place point C at (5,0) and D somewhere else.

Wait, maybe a better approach: assign coordinates so that calculations are easier.

Let me assign point A at (0,0).

Since EB is parallel to DC, and E is on AD, perhaps I can find the coordinates of E and D.

Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated, but let's try.

Let me assign:

Point A: (0,0)
Point C: (5,0) since AC is 5 units.
Point B is on AC, AB=3, so B is at (3,0).

EB is parallel to DC. So the direction vector of EB should be the same as DC.

Point D is somewhere; let me assign coordinates to D as (d_x, d_y).

Point E is on AD, so its coordinates can be parameterized. Since E is on AD, let's say E is at a point (t*d_x, t*d_y) where t is between 0 and 1. So E = (t d_x, t d_y).

Similarly, since EB is parallel to DC, the vector EB should be a scalar multiple of DC.

Vector EB is E - B = (t d_x -3, t d_y -0).

Vector DC is C - D = (5 - d_x, 0 - d_y).

Since EB is parallel to DC, their direction vectors must be scalar multiples. So:

(t d_x -3) / (5 - d_x) = (t d_y) / (-d_y)

Wait, that might get complicated. Alternatively, since EB || DC, their slopes must be equal.

Slope of EB: (E_y - B_y)/(E_x - B_x) = (t d_y -0)/(t d_x -3) = (t d_y)/(t d_x -3)

Slope of DC: (C_y - D_y)/(C_x - D_x) = (0 - d_y)/(5 - d_x) = (-d_y)/(5 - d_x)

Setting them equal:

(t d_y)/(t d_x -3) = (-d_y)/(5 - d_x)

We can cancel d_y from both sides, assuming d_y ≠ 0 (otherwise, the triangle would be degenerate).

So:

t/(t d_x -3) = -1/(5 - d_x)

Cross-multiplying:

t*(5 - d_x) = - (t d_x -3)

Expand left side: 5t - t d_x
Right side: -t d_x +3

So 5t - t d_x = -t d_x +3

Add t d_x to both sides: 5t =3 → t=3/5.

So t is 3/5. Since E is on AD, and E is (t d_x, t d_y), and t=3/5.

Now, ED is given as 3 units. ED is the distance from E to D.

So distance ED is sqrt( (d_x - t d_x)^2 + (d_y - t d_y)^2 ) = sqrt( (d_x (1-t))^2 + (d_y (1 -t))^2 ) = (1 - t) * sqrt( d_x² + d_y² )

We know ED=3. So,

(1 - t) * sqrt(d_x² + d_y² ) =3

We have t=3/5, so 1 - t=2/5.

So (2/5) * sqrt(d_x² + d_y² )=3 → sqrt(d_x² + d_y² )= (3 *5)/2=7.5.

So sqrt(d_x² + d_y² )=7.5 → d_x² +d_y² = (7.5)^2=56.25.

But wait, CD is 3.5 units. CD is the distance from C (5,0) to D (d_x, d_y).

So CD= sqrt( (d_x -5)^2 + (d_y -0)^2 )=3.5.

So sqrt( (d_x -5)^2 + d_y^2 )=3.5 → (d_x -5)^2 +d_y^2= (3.5)^2=12.25.

So now we have two equations:

1. d_x² +d_y² =56.25
2. (d_x -5)^2 +d_y^2=12.25

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

d_x² +d_y² - [ (d_x -5)^2 +d_y^2 ] =56.25 -12.25

Expand (d_x -5)^2: d_x² -10 d_x +25.

So:

d_x² +d_y² - (d_x² -10 d_x +25 +d_y^2 )=44

Simplify:

d_x² +d_y² -d_x² +10 d_x -25 -d_y²=44

The d_x² and d_y^2 terms cancel:

10 d_x -25=44 →10 d_x=69 →d_x=6.9.

Hmm, d_x=6.9. Now plug back into equation 2 to find d_y.

Equation 2: (6.9 -5)^2 +d_y^2=12.25 →(1.9)^2 +d_y^2=12.25 →3.61 +d_y^2=12.25 →d_y²=8.64 →d_y=±2.94.

So point D is at (6.9, 2.94) or (6.9, -2.94). But since triangles are typically considered in one plane, the sign might not matter, but let's proceed.

Now, the length AD is the distance from A (0,0) to D (6.9, 2.94):

AD= sqrt(6.9² +2.94² )= sqrt(47.61 +8.6436)=sqrt(56.2536)=7.5.

So AD is 7.5 units, which is option H.

Wait, that's consistent with what I got earlier using similar triangles.

So both methods give AD=7.5, which is option H.

To solve the problem, we start by noting that in triangle \( \triangle ACD \), points \( B \) and \( E \) are on sides \( AC \) and \( AD \), respectively, with \( EB \parallel DC \). This implies that triangles \( \triangle AEB \) and \( \triangle ADC \) are similar by the Basic Proportionality Theorem (Thales' Theorem). 

### Step 1: Identify the given lengths
- \( AB = 3 \), \( AC = 5 \), so \( BC = AC - AB = 5 - 3 = 2 \).
- \( ED = 3 \), and \( CD = 3.5 \).

### Step 2: Set up the proportion using similar triangles
Since \( EB \parallel DC \), the ratio of the sides of \( \triangle AEB \) to \( \triangle ADC \) is constant:
\[
\frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{AE}{AD}.
\]
Let \( AD = x \). Then \( AE = AD - ED = x - 3 \). Substituting the known values:
\[
\frac{3}{5} = \frac{x - 3}{x}.
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)
Cross-multiply to solve for \( x \):
\[
3x = 5(x - 3).
\]
Simplify:
\[
3x = 5x - 15.
\]
\[
-2x = -15.
\]
\[
x = \frac{15}{2} = 7.5.
\]

### Step 4: Verify the result
To confirm, we can use coordinate geometry. Assign coordinates such that \( A = (0,0) \), \( C = (5,0) \), and \( B = (3,0) \). Let \( D = (d_x, d_y) \), and \( E = (t d_x, t d_y) \), where \( t \) is a scaling factor. Since \( EB \parallel DC \), their slopes must be equal, leading to \( t = \frac{3}{5} \). Using the distance formula for \( ED = 3 \), we find \( \sqrt{(d_x - t d_x)^2 + (d_y - t d_y)^2} = 3 \). Solving this confirms \( AD = 7.5 \).

### Final Answer
The length of \( AD \) is \( 7.5 \), which corresponds to option \( H \).
