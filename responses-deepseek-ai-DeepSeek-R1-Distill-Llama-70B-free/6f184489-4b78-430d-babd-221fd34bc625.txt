Question:

How doesAllport'sconcept of functional autonomy differ from most other theories of motivation?

Options:

A: Functional autonomy permits a relative divorce from the past of the organism
B: Functional autonomy maintains that current motives are directly tied to an individual's history
C: Functional autonomy posits that behavior is always a reaction to immediate stimuli
D: Functional autonomy indicates that motivation decreases as the organism ages
E: Functional autonomy relies heavily on biological drives
F: Functional autonomy suggests all behavior is a result of learned associations
G: Functional autonomy is solely determined by external rewards and punishments
H: Functional autonomy emphasizes past experiences
I: Functional autonomy requires constant biological reinforcement
J: Functional autonomy is only applicable in early childhood development

Okay, so I've got this question about Allport's concept of functional autonomy and how it differs from other theories of motivation. Hmm, I remember Allport was a psychologist, right? He was one of the early ones, maybe in the mid-20th century. His theories were about personality, I think. 

Wait, functional autonomy... I think that's about how adult motives become independent from their original causes. So, for example, a child might start doing something because of a reward, but as they grow, they keep doing it because it's become a part of who they are, not for the original reward anymore. So it's about motives becoming self-sustaining.

The question is asking how this differs from other theories. Most other theories, like maybe Freud's psychoanalysis or behaviorism, tend to focus on past experiences or external stimuli. Freud would say that current behavior is tied to past unconscious conflicts. Behaviorists like Skinner would say behavior is due to reinforcement and conditioning.

So if Allport's functional autonomy says that motives are somewhat divorced from their origins, that must be different. Let me look at the options.

Option A says functional autonomy permits a relative divorce from the organism's past. That sounds right because the motives become independent. 

Option B says motives are tied to individual's history, which would be the opposite. So B is probably wrong.

Option C says behavior is reaction to immediate stimuli. That's more like behaviorist or stimulus-response theories, not Allport's.

Option D says motivation decreases with age. I don't think that's part of functional autonomy. Maybe some theories suggest that, but not Allport's.

Option E relies on biological drives. That's more like instinct theories or maybe Freud's id-related drives. Not Allport.

Option F says behavior is learned associations. That's behaviorism again, like classical conditioning.

Option G is about external rewards and punishments. Again, behaviorist. So no.

Option H emphasizes past experiences. That's probably Freudian or other psychodynamic theories.

Option I requires biological reinforcement. Maybe something like drive-reduction theories, but not Allport.

Option J is only applicable in early childhood. I don't think Allport's theory is limited to that. It's about adults as well.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be A. Because Allport's idea is that motives become autonomous, moving away from their original causes, which is a relative divorce from the past.

Allport's concept of functional autonomy suggests that adult motives become independent from their original causes, evolving into self-sustaining drives. This differs from other theories that often emphasize past experiences, external stimuli, or biological drives. The correct answer is:

A: Functional autonomy permits a relative divorce from the past of the organism.

Answer: A
