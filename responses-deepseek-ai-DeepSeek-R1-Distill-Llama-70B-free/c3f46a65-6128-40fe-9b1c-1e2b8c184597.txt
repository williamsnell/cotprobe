Question:

Lizette and her family watch the sunset over the ocean. While walking home in the increasing darkness, Lizette notices that she can no longer distinguish the colors of objects. Which of the following best explains why Lizette cannot see color in dim light?

Options:

A: Lizette's eyes are adjusting to the darkness, hence she cannot distinguish the colors of objects.
B: Cones, which are specialized for color vision, require more light to be activated, whereas rods, which produce images in black, white, and gray, allow for vision in dim light.
C: The retina does not respond to changes in light intensity, therefore colors are not visible in dim light.
D: The receptive fields in the retina respond to the loss of light through light adaptation, the process of rapidly adjusting to a diminution of light.
E: Cones, which are specialized for black and white vision, require a small amount of light to be activated, whereas rods, which produce images in color, require greater amounts of light for vision.
F: Rods and cones both require a high amount of light to be activated, hence color vision is not possible in dim light.
G: The cones, which are responsible for color vision, are deactivated in dim light.
H: The color vision is not possible in the dark because the photoreceptor cells in the retina require light to detect colors.
I: The colors are not visible in dim light because the rods, which detect colors, are deactivated.
J: Rods, which are specialized for color vision, require more light to be activated, whereas cones, which produce images in black, white, and gray, allow for vision in dim light.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why Lizette can't see colors in the dim light. Hmm, I remember that the human eye has two types of photoreceptor cells: rods and cones. I think cones are responsible for color vision, while rods handle low-light vision but don't see colors. 

Wait, so when it's bright, cones are active, and we see colors. But in the dark, rods take over because they're more sensitive to light. So Lizette can't see colors because her cones aren't active in low light. 

Looking at the options, option B says cones require more light and rods handle dim light in black and white. That makes sense. Option E seems reversed, saying cones do black and white, which I don't think is right. Option J also seems wrong because it swaps rods and cones' roles. 

So the correct answer should be B because it correctly states that cones need more light for color, and rods handle the dim light without color.

The correct explanation is that cones, which are responsible for color vision, require more light to function, while rods handle vision in low light but only in black, white, and gray. 

Answer: B
