Question:

One evening, a defendant set fire to a homeowner's occupied house. As a result of the blaze, the homeowner's daughter was killed. The defendant was charged with felony murder on the first count and arson on the second count of the two-count indictment. The jury found the defendant guilty on the first count, but returned a not guilty verdict on the second. The defendant's attorney's motion to set aside the guilty verdict on the felony murder charge will most likely be

Options:

A: granted, because the defendant's right to a fair trial was violated by the inconsistent verdicts.
B: denied, because the jury's decision is final and cannot be overturned.
C: denied, because the defendant's proper remedy is to seek an appellate review for a non-constitutional error.
D: denied, because the verdicts do not amount to a reversible error.
E: granted, because the guilty verdict is plain error that adversely affects the defendant's constitutional rights.
F: granted, because the verdicts contradict each other, raising reasonable doubt.
G: granted, because the verdicts are legally inconsistent and should lead to an acquittal of both charges.
H: denied, because the jury found sufficient evidence to convict on the first count, regardless of the second count outcome.
I: granted, because the defendant was not directly responsible for the death.

Okay, so I've got this law question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm still learning this stuff.

The question is about a defendant who set fire to an occupied house. As a result, the homeowner's daughter died. The defendant is charged with two counts: felony murder in the first count and arson in the second. The jury found him guilty on the first count but not guilty on the second. Now, the defense attorney is moving to set aside the guilty verdict on the felony murder charge. The question is whether this motion will be granted or denied, and why.

Hmm, I remember that felony murder is a doctrine where a death occurs during the commission of a felony. So, if the underlying felony is arson, then felony murder applies. But wait, in this case, the jury acquitted the defendant of arson. So does that mean the felony murder conviction can't stand?

Wait, but I think the felony murder rule doesn't require the defendant to be convicted of the underlying felony. Oh, right! Because for felony murder, the underlying felony just needs to have been committed, not necessarily that the defendant was convicted of it. So the acquittal on the arson charge doesn't automatically overturn the felony murder conviction.

But what about the consistency of the verdicts? Some might say that if the jury found him not guilty of arson, then how can he be guilty of felony murder based on that arson? That seems inconsistent. But I remember something about jury verdicts being inconsistent not necessarily leading to reversal. The idea is that each count is separate, and the jury could have different reasoning for each.

Wait, but isn't there a case where the Supreme Court said that inconsistent verdicts don't necessarily violate a defendant's rights? I think it was United States v. Powell, where the court held that inconsistent verdicts don't require reversal because each count is treated separately. The jury might have doubts about one count but not the other, or they might have compromised in some way.

So in this case, the jury found the defendant guilty of felony murder but not guilty of arson. Even though the felony murder charge is based on the arson, the acquittal on the arson doesn't negate the felony murder conviction because the jury could have found that the defendant committed the arson (for felony murder) without convicting him on the arson count. Maybe they thought that the elements for felony murder were met, but the elements for the standalone arson weren't, or perhaps they were lenient on one count but not the other.

So when the defense moves to set aside the verdict, the court would likely deny the motion. The inconsistency in the verdicts isn't a basis for overturning the conviction. The defendant's remedy, if any, might be on appeal, but the trial court usually doesn't set aside a verdict just because of inconsistent outcomes.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A says the motion will be granted because the inconsistent verdicts violated the right to a fair trial. But I don't think that's correct because the Supreme Court has said that inconsistent verdicts don't violate due process.

Option B says the jury's decision is final and cannot be overturned. Well, it's not that they can't be overturned, but in this case, the inconsistency isn't grounds for overturning.

Option C suggests the proper remedy is appellate review for non-constitutional error. That might be true, but the motion here is to set aside the verdict, which is a trial court decision. So maybe the trial court won't grant it, but the appellate court could review it. But I'm not sure if that's the reason the motion would be denied.

Option D says the verdicts don't amount to reversible error. That sounds right because the inconsistency isn't considered a reversible error.

Option E claims it's plain error affecting constitutional rights. I don't think it's plain error because the inconsistency doesn't inherently violate constitutional rights.

Option F says the verdicts contradict each other, raising reasonable doubt. But courts don't typically use that reasoning to overturn verdicts.

Option G says the verdicts are legally inconsistent and should lead to acquittal. I don't think that's the case because each count is separate.

Option H says the jury found sufficient evidence on the first count. That's true, but it doesn't address the inconsistency issue.

Option I says the defendant wasn't directly responsible for the death, but felony murder doesn't require direct responsibility.

So putting it all together, the motion to set aside is likely to be denied because inconsistent verdicts don't necessarily constitute reversible error. So the answer is either D or H. Wait, D says the verdicts don't amount to reversible error, which aligns with what I was thinking. H focuses on sufficient evidence, which is a different point. The question is about the inconsistency leading to setting aside the verdict, so D is more on point.

The question revolves around whether a defendant's motion to set aside a guilty verdict for felony murder will be granted or denied when the jury also acquitted the defendant of the underlying felony (arson). Felony murder is a doctrine where a death occurring during the commission of a felony can lead to a murder conviction, even if the defendant is not directly responsible for the death. Importantly, the defendant does not need to be convicted of the underlying felony for felony murder to apply.

In this case, the jury found the defendant guilty of felony murder but not guilty of arson. This creates an apparent inconsistency in the verdicts. However, the Supreme Court has held that inconsistent verdicts do not necessarily violate a defendant's rights or constitute reversible error (see *United States v. Powell*). Each count in an indictment is treated separately, and the jury may have different reasoning for each verdict. For example, the jury might have found sufficient evidence to support felony murder but insufficient evidence to convict on the arson charge.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** is incorrect because inconsistent verdicts do not inherently violate the right to a fair trial.  
- **Option B** is incorrect because jury decisions are not absolutely final and can be reviewed, but inconsistency alone is not grounds for reversal.  
- **Option C** is incorrect because the motion to set aside the verdict is a trial court decision, not an appellate remedy.  
- **Option D** is correct because inconsistent verdicts do not amount to reversible error.  
- **Option E** is incorrect because the inconsistency does not constitute plain error affecting constitutional rights.  
- **Option F** is incorrect because contradictory verdicts do not automatically raise reasonable doubt.  
- **Option G** is incorrect because legally inconsistent verdicts do not automatically lead to acquittal.  
- **Option H** is incorrect because the focus is on inconsistency, not the sufficiency of evidence.  
- **Option I** is incorrect because felony murder does not require direct responsibility for the death.

The most accurate answer is **Option D**, as inconsistent verdicts do not amount to reversible error.

Answer: D
