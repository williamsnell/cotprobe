Okay, so I've got this double integral problem to solve. The integral is of the function 2x - 4y³ over a rectangular region R, which is defined as [-5, 4] for x and [0,3] for y. Hmm, I remember that double integrals can be split into two separate single integrals, one for each variable. So I think I'll start by setting this up as an iterated integral.

First, I'll write the integral as the integral from x = -5 to x = 4, and for each x, y goes from 0 to 3. So it becomes the integral from -5 to 4 of [ integral from 0 to 3 of (2x -4y³) dy ] dx. 

Wait, no, maybe I should switch the order. Sometimes it's easier to integrate with respect to one variable first. But in this case, the function is 2x minus 4y³. Let me think which order is better. Oh wait, since 2x is only a function of x, and 4y³ is only a function of y, maybe it's easier to split the integral into two separate parts.

So I can write this as the integral over x of 2x dx from -5 to 4 multiplied by the integral over y of 1 dy from 0 to 3, plus the integral over x of (-4) dx from -5 to 4 multiplied by the integral over y of y³ dy from 0 to3. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because 2x is integrated with respect to y, and then with x. Wait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the integral is over both x and y. So let me try to break it down. The double integral of (2x -4y³) dA can be split into two separate integrals: the integral of 2x dA plus the integral of (-4y³) dA. So that's the same as 2 times the integral of x over R dA minus 4 times the integral of y³ over R dA.

Wait, but integrating 2x over R would involve integrating x from -5 to4, and y from 0 to3. Because for each x, y ranges independently. So maybe I should handle each part separately.

Let's compute the first part: the integral of 2x dA. So that would be the integral from y=0 to3 of [ integral from x=-5 to4 of 2x dx ] dy. Because for each y, x ranges from -5 to4. So integrating 2x with respect to x from -5 to4.

The integral of 2x dx is x² evaluated from -5 to4. So [ (4)^2 - (-5)^2 ] = 16 -25 = -9. Then we multiply by the integral over y, which is from 0 to3 of dy, which is 3. So the first part becomes 2 * (-9) *3. Wait, wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the 2 is part of the integrand. So the integral of 2x dx is x² from -5 to4, giving -9 as before. Then, multiply by the integral over y from 0 to3 of dy, which is 3. So the first part is 2 times (integral of x over x from -5 to4) times (integral over y from 0 to3 of 1 dy). Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me correct this.

Wait, the 2x term: when integrating over y, it's treated as a constant. So the integral from y=0 to3 of 2x dy would be 2x*(3 -0) =6x. Then, we integrate 6x from x=-5 to4. So the integral of 6x dx is 3x² evaluated from -5 to4. So 3*(4)^2 -3*(-5)^2 = 48 -75 = -27. So the first part is -27.

Now the second part: the integral of -4y³ over R. So that's -4 times the integral over R of y³ dA. This can be split into the integral over x of 1 dx times the integral over y of y³ dy. So the integral over x from -5 to4 is (4 - (-5))=9. The integral of y³ from 0 to3 is [ (y^4)/4 ] from 0 to3, which is (81/4) -0 =81/4. So the second part is -4 *9*(81/4). Wait, let me compute that.

Wait, 9 comes from the integral over x (since dx from -5 to4 is 9). The integral over y is 81/4. So the product is 9 * (81/4) = (729/4). Then multiply by -4: -4*(729/4) = -729.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck that step. Because the integral of y³ dy from 0 to3 is (3^4)/4 =81/4. So the integral over R of y³ dA is (4 - (-5))*(81/4) =9 *81/4 = 729/4. Then, the integral of -4y³ dA is -4 * (729/4) = -729.

So putting the two parts together: the first integral was -27, the second is -729. So the total is -27 + (-729) = -756.

Wait, but looking back, I think I might have made a mistake in the first part. Let me double-check.

First part: integral of 2x over R.

So integral over R of 2x dA is 2 * integral from x=-5 to4 [ integral y=0 to3 dy ] x dx.

Wait, the inner integral over y is ∫0^3 dy =3. So the integral becomes 2 * ∫_{-5}^4 x *3 dx.

So that's 6 * ∫_{-5}^4 x dx.

The integral of x dx from -5 to4 is [x² /2] from -5 to4.

Compute: (4²/2) - ((-5)^2)/2 = (16/2) - (25/2) =8 -12.5 = -4.5.

So 6 * (-4.5) = -27. That's correct.

So the first part is -27, the second is -729, so total is -756. Looking at the options, option E is -756. So the answer should be E.

To compute the double integral $\iint\limits_{R} (2x - 4y^3) \, dA$ over the rectangle $R = [-5, 4] \times [0, 3]$, we split the integral into two parts:

1. **First part: Integral of $2x$ over $R$**

   The integral of $2x$ over $R$ can be written as:
   \[
   \int_{-5}^4 \int_0^3 2x \, dy \, dx
   \]
   Since $2x$ is independent of $y$, the inner integral over $y$ is:
   \[
   \int_0^3 2x \, dy = 2x \cdot (3 - 0) = 6x
   \]
   Now, integrate $6x$ over $x$:
   \[
   \int_{-5}^4 6x \, dx = 6 \cdot \frac{x^2}{2} \Big|_{-5}^4 = 3x^2 \Big|_{-5}^4 = 3(4^2) - 3((-5)^2) = 48 - 75 = -27
   \]

2. **Second part: Integral of $-4y^3$ over $R$**

   The integral of $-4y^3$ over $R$ can be written as:
   \[
   \int_{-5}^4 \int_0^3 -4y^3 \, dy \, dx
   \]
   Since $-4y^3$ is independent of $x$, the inner integral over $x$ is:
   \[
   \int_{-5}^4 -4y^3 \, dx = -4y^3 \cdot (4 - (-5)) = -4y^3 \cdot 9 = -36y^3
   \]
   Now, integrate $-36y^3$ over $y$:
   \[
   \int_0^3 -36y^3 \, dy = -36 \cdot \frac{y^4}{4} \Big|_0^3 = -9y^4 \Big|_0^3 = -9(81) - (-9(0)) = -729
   \]

3. **Combine the two parts**

   Adding the results of the two parts:
   \[
   -27 + (-729) = -756
   \]

Thus, the value of the double integral is $-756$. Comparing this with the given options, the correct answer is:

E: -756
