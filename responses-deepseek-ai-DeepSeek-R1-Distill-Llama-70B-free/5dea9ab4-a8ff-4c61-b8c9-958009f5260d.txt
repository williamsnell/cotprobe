Okay, so I have this question about Peanuts characters and how much Lucy charges for her psychiatric advice. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with all the details of Peanuts, but I remember that Lucy is one of the main characters. She's known for being a bit bossy and having a psychiatric booth where she offers advice.

Wait, I think in the Peanuts comic strip, Lucy sets up a stand or booth where she provides advice. The classic image is her sitting behind a booth with a sign that says something like "The Doctor is In." Now, the question is about how much she charges. I'm trying to remember if it's a specific amount mentioned in the strips or any of the TV specials.

I recall that it's a small amount, probably just a few cents because the Peanuts characters are kids. So, let's think about the options given. The options are various amounts, some in dollars, some in cents. The options are A: 50 cents, B: $1, C: $125, D: 10 cents, E: $5, F: $20, G: $100, H: 75 cents, I: $50, J: 5 cents.

I think Lucy's rate is really cheap, like just a nickel or a dime. I'm trying to remember if it's 5 cents or 10 cents. Wait, in the comic, I think she charges 5 cents. Because that's a common jokeâ€”her advice is not very good, but it's cheap. So the answer would be 5 cents.

Looking back at the options, J is 5 cents. So the answer should be J.

The answer is J: 5 cents.
