Okay, so I've got this problem here where a person is walking in different directions, and I need to figure out how far they end up from where they started. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the person starts by walking 3 miles east. Then they turn north and walk 10 miles. After that, they turn west and walk 6 miles, and finally, they head south for 16 miles. I need to find the straight-line distance from the starting point to the ending point.

I remember from school that this is probably a problem involving right triangles and the Pythagorean theorem because the movements are in perpendicular directions. Let me visualize this. East and west are along the x-axis, and north and south along the y-axis.

So, let's break it down. Starting at point (0,0). 

First, moving east 3 miles: that would take them to (3,0).

Then, turning north for 10 miles. North is positive y direction, so now they're at (3,10).

Next, turning west for 6 miles. West is negative x. So from x=3, subtract 6, which brings them to x = -3. So new position is (-3,10).

Finally, turning south for 16 miles. South is negative y, so from y=10, subtract 16. That would take y to 10-16 = -6. So final position is (-3,-6).

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check that again. Oh wait, no, wait. No, when you go north, you add to y, so from 0 to 10. Then, when you go south, you subtract. So 10 -16 is indeed -6. So yes, ending at (-3,-6).

Now, to find the distance from the origin (0,0) to (-3,-6). The distance formula is the square root of (x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2. Since x1 and y1 are 0, it's sqrt( (-3)^2 + (-6)^2 ).

Calculating that: (-3)^2 is 9, (-6)^2 is 36. Sum is 45. Square root of 45 is... well, sqrt(36) is 6, sqrt(49) is 7. So sqrt(45) is somewhere between 6 and 7. Let me calculate it more accurately.

45 factors into 9*5, so sqrt(9*5) is 3*sqrt(5). Sqrt(5) is approximately 2.236. So 3 * 2.236 is about 6.708. Hmm, so approximately 6.7 miles.

Looking at the options, option G is 6.7. But wait, let me double-check my steps because the options also have other similar numbers.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the directions? Let me go through each movement again.

East 3: x=3.

North 10: y=10.

West 6: so x=3-6= -3.

South 16: y=10-16= -6. So yes, final position is (-3,-6).

So the distance is sqrt( (-3)^2 + (-6)^2 ) = sqrt(9 + 36) = sqrt(45) ≈ 6.708 miles. So option G is 6.7.

Wait, but let me see the options again. The choices are A:5.5, B:13.9, C:10.3, D:9.2, E:3.4, F:8.1, G:6.7, H:2.7, I:12.8, J:7.8.

So G is 6.7, which matches our calculation. So the answer should be G.

Wait a second, could I have messed up the directions? Let me think again. Oh wait, when you go west 6 miles from east 3, that's a bigger move west. So 3 east minus 6 west is net 3 west, which is -3 on x-axis. Then, north 10 and south 16: net is 6 south, which is -6 on y-axis.

So yes, that's correct. So sqrt(3² +6²)= sqrt(45)=6.708, which is 6.7 miles.

So the correct answer is G.

To determine how far the person is from their starting point, we analyze their movements in terms of displacements along the x-axis (east-west) and y-axis (north-south). The person starts at the origin (0,0).

1. **East 3 miles**: Moves to (3,0).
2. **North 10 miles**: Moves to (3,10).
3. **West 6 miles**: Moves to (-3,10).
4. **South 16 miles**: Moves to (-3,-6).

The final position is (-3,-6). To find the straight-line distance from the origin, we use the distance formula:

\[
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(-3)^2 + (-6)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 36} = \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \, \text{miles}.
\]

From the given options, the closest value is **6.7 miles**, which corresponds to option **G**.
