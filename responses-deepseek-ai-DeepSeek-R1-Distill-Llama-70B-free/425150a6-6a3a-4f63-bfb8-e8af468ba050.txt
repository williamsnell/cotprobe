Okay, so I've got this question about Aristotle's views on virtue and vice. I'm trying to remember what I learned in my philosophy class. I think Aristotle had some specific ideas about ethics and human behavior. 

Wait, I remember that he talked a lot about virtues being habits. Like, virtues are developed through practice and habituation. So if that's the case, then virtue would be something we can control because we can choose to practice good habits. 

But what about vice? Vice is the opposite of virtue, right? So if virtue is within our power to develop, then vice should also be within our control. Because if we can choose to act virtuously, we can also choose to act in a way that's not virtuous. 

I think Aristotle said that vice is voluntary. Like, people choose to do bad things because they give in to their base desires. So if vice is voluntary, then it's within our power. So both virtue and vice are things we can control. 

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that says both are in our power. Let me go through each option. 

Option A says vice is in our power, but virtue is not. That doesn't sound right because I think Aristotle would say we can develop virtues. 

Option B says both are in our power. That seems to fit what I was thinking. 

Option C says vice is in our power and so is virtue—same as B, maybe? Wait, let me check. Option B says 'and so is vice', which is same as both. 

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the options. Let me read each carefully. 

Option A: vice is in our power, virtue not. No. 

Option B: virtue is in our power, and so is vice. Yes, that's both. 

Option C: vice is in our power, and so is virtue. Same as B. Wait, are B and C the same? Wait, no, maybe wording is different but meaning same. 

Wait, looking again. Option B says "virtue is in our power, and so is vice." Option C says "vice is in our power, and so is virtue." They're just reversing the order, but the meaning is the same. So both B and C are saying both are in our power. Hmm, that's confusing. Are there two correct options? That can't be. 

Wait, maybe I'm misremembering. Let me think again. Did Aristotle say that we can choose virtue but not vice, or both? Or is it the other way around? 

In the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle says that virtue and vice are both in our power. He argues that we are responsible for our character because it's formed by our choices. So, yes, both are within our control. 

So both B and C would be correct, but looking at the options, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the options again. 

Wait, looking at the options, option B: "virtue is in our power, and so is vice." Option C: "vice is in our power, and so is virtue." So they're the same in meaning, just phrased differently. But that can't be right because the question expects one correct answer. 

Wait, perhaps I misread. Let me check the options again. 

Wait, no, the options are A through J, but in the list, each option is unique. So maybe I'm mixing up the letters. 

Wait, the actual options are: 

A: vice is in our power, but virtue isn't. 

B: virtue is in our power, and so is vice. 

C: vice is in our power, and so is virtue. 

Wait, that's possible. So B and C are the same, but perhaps I'm getting confused. No, I think the user made each option unique. Wait no, looking again, I see that options B and C seem to have the same meaning but are different letters. But that can't be because the question expects only one correct answer. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. Maybe the correct answer is B. Or perhaps the wording is slightly different. Wait, perhaps in the options, B says 'so is vice' and C says 'so is virtue'—no, that can't be. 

Wait, no, the options are as follows:

Option B: virtue is in our power, and so is vice. 

Option C: vice is in our power, and so is virtue. 

They are the same in meaning, just the order is reversed. So perhaps both B and C are correct, but that can't be. Maybe the question has a typo, but I have to choose from the given options. 

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The correct answer is that both are in our power, so the correct options would be either B or C, depending on how they're phrased. 

Wait, looking back, the question is about what Aristotle claims. I remember that in Book III of Nicomachean Ethics, he discusses that virtuous and vicious actions are voluntary. So both are within our power. 

So the correct answer should be the option that says both are in our power. So looking at the options, both B and C seem to say that, but that's impossible. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the options. 

Wait, maybe the options are such that only one of them says both. Let me re-read the options again. 

The options are: 

A: vice is in our power, but virtue is not. 

B: virtue is in our power, and so is vice. 

C: vice is in our power, and so is virtue. 

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B or C. But since that can't be, perhaps I'm missing something. 

Wait, maybe the correct answer is B. Because option B says "virtue is in our power, and so is vice," which is the same as saying both are in our power. 

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the exact quote. I think the exact quote from Aristotle is that "virtue and vice are in our power." So either option B or C would fit, but perhaps the correct option is B. 

Wait, no, I think the correct answer is B. Or perhaps I should check again. 

Wait, looking more carefully, the options are:

B: virtue is in our power, and so is vice. 

C: vice is in our power, and so is virtue.

So they are the same in meaning, which is confusing. So perhaps the correct answer is B. 

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B. So I'll go with B.

Aristotle's views on virtue and vice, as expressed in his *Nicomachean Ethics*, emphasize that both are within human control. He argues that virtues and vices are developed through habituation and that individuals are responsible for their character because it is shaped by their choices. Virtuous actions, like virtuous character traits, are voluntary, and the same applies to vicious actions and vices. Therefore, both virtue and vice are in our power.

Analyzing the options, both **B** and **C** seem to convey the same meaning: that both virtue and vice are within our control. However, since the question expects a single correct answer, **B** is selected as it directly states, "virtue is in our power, and so is vice," aligning with Aristotle's perspective.

Answer: B
