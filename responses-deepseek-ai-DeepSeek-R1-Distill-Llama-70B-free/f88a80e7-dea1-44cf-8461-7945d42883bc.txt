Okay, so I need to figure out which of these options is not a correct definition. Let's go through each one step by step.

First, I'll try to understand each term and see if the definitions make sense based on what I know about security concepts.

Option A: Acting subjects are who or what is acting to produce security or insecurity. That sounds right. Acting subjects could be individuals, organizations, or states taking actions that affect security.

Option B: Reactive security is responding to threats after they occur. Yeah, that's like reacting to an attack after it's happened, like incident response.

Option C: Relative security is being safe compared to others. So, if one state is more secure than another, they have relative security. That makes sense.

Option D: Absolute security means completely free from all threats. I remember that absolute security is impossible because there are always risks, but the definition here is correct—it's stating the concept, not its feasibility.

Option E: Referent object is what we're trying to secure. Like, if a state is the referent object, security measures are taken to protect it. That sounds right.

Option F: Objective security is when a matter is objectively a security issue, regardless of interpretation. Wait, objective usually means based on facts, but in security studies, sometimes objective security refers to material conditions independent of perception. However, the definition here says it's considered a security issue regardless of interpretation. That might be correct because it's about the actual situation, not how people see it.

Option G: Collective security through cooperation. Like NATO or the UN, where multiple parties work together to achieve security. That's accurate.

Option H: Proactive security is preventing threats before they happen. Like implementing security measures to avoid attacks. Correct.

Option I: Substantive content is about what being secure looks like. So it's the actual conditions that define security. That makes sense.

Wait, I'm trying to think if any of these are incorrect. Let me think about each again.

Option F says Objective security is when a matter is objectively a security issue regardless of interpretation. But from what I recall, objective security often refers to the actual, material conditions, not about whether it's considered a security issue. Maybe it's the opposite. Wait, security can be subjective because it's based on perception. Objective security would mean it's a real threat, not just a perception. So the definition here might be correct because it's stating that it's objectively a security issue, irrespective of how people interpret it.

Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up terms. Alternatively, perhaps the incorrect definition is F because objective security isn't about being considered a security issue regardless of interpretation. Maybe it's about the actual condition, not the consideration.

Wait, another approach: the question asks which is not correct. So, perhaps option F is incorrect because objective security refers to the actual state, not whether it's considered a security issue. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Alternatively, perhaps the definition in F is correct. Because if something is an objective security issue, it's based on facts, not interpretations. So the definition seems accurate.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me check other options again.

Wait, another thought: Objective security is about the real, tangible conditions, not perceptions. So if a matter is objectively a security issue, it's because of the actual circumstances, regardless of whether people see it that way. So the definition in F is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the incorrect option is D: Absolute security. Because in reality, absolute security is impossible, but the definition is correct—it's just that it's unattainable. But the question is about the definition being correct, not if it's possible.

Wait, maybe none of the options are incorrect except one. Perhaps option F is correct, so I'm missing something.

Wait, another angle: The term 'objective security' might not be a standard term. Let me think. Security studies often talk about objective and subjective security. Objective security refers to the actual absence of threats, while subjective is the feeling of being secure. So the definition in F says it's when a matter is objectively considered a security issue regardless of interpretation. Wait, but 'objectively considered' might be redundant. Because objective is independent of consideration. So maybe the definition is incorrect because it's mixing up the concepts.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct definition of objective security is when a threat exists regardless of perception, making F correct. Hmm.

Wait, another option: Option B is reactive security, which is after the threat. That's correct. Proactive is before, which is H, correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me try to think of other concepts. Substantive content (I) is about what security entails, which is correct.

Wait a minute, another thought: Option F says "objectively considered a security issue, regardless of interpretation." But if it's objective, it's not about consideration but about facts. So perhaps the definition is incorrect because it's mixing objective with consideration. Because 'considered' implies a subjective element, but objective is about facts, not consideration.

So, perhaps option F is incorrect. Because objective security isn't about being considered a security issue, it's about the actual conditions. So the definition in F is wrong.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should double-check what each term means.

After some quick research in my mind, I recall that in security studies, 'objective security' refers to the actual, material conditions that exist, independent of perception. So whether something is a security issue can be objective, meaning based on real factors, not just how people see it.

So the definition in F says it's when a matter is objectively considered a security issue, regardless of interpretation. That seems correct because it's saying it's a security issue based on objective factors, not subjective interpretations.

Wait, but maybe another term is being confused here. Perhaps 'objective security' isn't the same as 'objectively considered'. Alternatively, perhaps the correct definition is that objective security is about the real threats, not the perception.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is that 'objective security' is when the threat is real, regardless of whether people perceive it. So the definition in F is correct.

Alternatively, I'm starting to think that maybe option F is correct, so perhaps another option is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I should think about each option again.

Option D: Absolute security is when completely free from all threats. That's the definition, even though it's unattainable, but the definition is correct.

Option F: Objective security is when a matter is objectively a security issue, regardless of interpretation. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F. Because 'objectively considered' might be a misnomer. Because objective is not about consideration, but about facts.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct term is 'objectively a security issue', not 'objectively considered'. So the definition in F is incorrect because it uses 'considered' which implies subjectivity.

So, maybe F is the incorrect definition.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the terms again.

Another approach: Which of these terms is not typically used or defined that way.

Wait, I'm pretty sure that 'reactive security' is about responding after the threat, so B is correct.

'Proactive' is before, H correct.

'Collective security' is correct as G.

'Relative security' as C, correct.

'Absolute security' as D, correct.

'Acting subjects' A, correct.

'Referent object' E, correct.

'Substantive content' I, correct.

So the only one left is F. If F is incorrect, it's the answer.

But I'm not 100% sure, but based on the reasoning, perhaps F is incorrect because 'objectively considered' is mixing concepts. Objective is fact-based, not about consideration.

To determine which option is not a correct definition, each term and its definition were analyzed in detail:

- **Option A**: Acting subjects are defined as who or what is acting to produce security or insecurity. This is accurate, as acting subjects can be individuals, organizations, or states influencing security.

- **Option B**: Reactive security is described as responding to threats after they have occurred. This aligns with standard definitions of reactive security, such as incident response.

- **Option C**: Relative security refers to being safe relative to others. This is correct, as it compares the security of one entity to another.

- **Option D**: Absolute security is defined as being completely free from all threats. While absolute security is often considered unattainable, the definition itself is correct.

- **Option E**: Referent object is defined as the entity being secured. This is accurate, as it refers to the target of security measures.

- **Option F**: Objective security is described as a matter being objectively considered a security issue, regardless of interpretation. This definition is problematic because "objective security" typically refers to material conditions independent of perception, not "consideration." The phrase "objectively considered" mixes objective and subjective elements, making this definition incorrect.

- **Option G**: Collective security is achieved through cooperation among multiple parties. This is correct, as seen in organizations like NATO or the UN.

- **Option H**: Proactive security involves preventing threats before they occur. This is accurate, as it refers to anticipatory measures.

- **Option I**: Substantive content refers to the conditions that define security. This is correct, as it describes what being secure entails.

After careful analysis, **Option F** stands out as the incorrect definition because it conflates "objective" with "considered," which introduces a subjective element inconsistent with the concept of objective security.
