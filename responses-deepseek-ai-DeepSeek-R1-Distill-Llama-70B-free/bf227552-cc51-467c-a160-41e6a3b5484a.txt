Okay, let's tackle this physics problem. Hmm, so the question is about a mass-spring system, right? I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

So, the problem says we've got a mass of 100 grams, which is 0.1 kg, and it's stretching a spring by 5 cm. Wait, 5 cm is 0.05 meters. Oh right, because centimeters to meters is division by 100. 

The setup is that the mass is set in motion from its equilibrium position with a downward velocity of 10 cm/s. Oh, that's 0.1 m/s. And there's no damping, so we don't have to worry about any energy loss in the system. The question is asking when the mass first returns to its equilibrium position.

Wait, I remember that in simple harmonic motion (SHM), the mass returns to the equilibrium position periodically. So I need to find the period of the motion first, and then determine the time it takes to come back.

First, I should find the spring constant, k. Oh right, Hooke's Law: F = -kx. The force here is provided by the mass, so F = ma. Wait, when the spring is stretched, the force is mg. Wait, no, wait. The mass is hanging, so the weight is mg. But wait, the problem doesn't say it's hanging; it just says it's stretched. Oh, wait, the mass is placed on the spring, causing it to stretch. So the force applied is the weight of the mass, which is mg. So F = mg = kx, where x is the stretch.

Wait, but wait, the mass is 100 grams, so m = 0.1 kg. g is 9.8 m/s², right? So F = 0.1 * 9.8 = 0.98 N. The stretch x is 0.05 m. So k = F/x = 0.98 / 0.05. Let me calculate that. 0.98 divided by 0.05 is 19.6 N/m. So k is 19.6 N/m.

Now, the angular frequency ω for a mass-spring system is sqrt(k/m). So m is 0.1 kg, k is 19.6. So ω = sqrt(19.6 / 0.1) = sqrt(196) = 14 rad/s. Oh, that's a nice number.

The period T is 2π divided by ω. So T = 2π /14 = π/7 seconds. Wait, because 2 divided by 14 is 1/7, so 2π/14 is π/7. So the period is π/7 s. That means the system completes one full oscillation every π/7 seconds.

But the question is when does the mass first return to its equilibrium position. Hmm. So in SHM, the mass passes through the equilibrium point twice in each period: once going in the positive direction, and once going negative. So the period is the time for a full cycle, but the time to return to equilibrium is half of that? Or wait, no. Wait, wait, let me think.

Wait, when you release the mass from the stretched position, it's moving towards equilibrium. So the time to reach equilibrium for the first time is a quarter of the period. Because the period is the time for a full cycle: from equilibrium, stretch, back to equilibrium, compression, back to equilibrium, and so on. So the time to go from maximum stretch to equilibrium is T/4. Because in T/4, it moves from max displacement to equilibrium. Then another T/4 to reach max compression, T/2 to go back to equilibrium, and so on.

Wait, but wait, in this problem, the mass is set in motion from the equilibrium position with a downward velocity. Oh, wait! So the mass is at equilibrium, and we're pushing it downward with an initial velocity. So at time t=0, x=0, and velocity is downward (let's say positive direction) of 0.1 m/s.

Wait, but when the mass is at equilibrium, its displacement x is zero. So the initial condition is x(0) = 0 and v(0)=0.1 m/s. Hmm, so how does this affect the motion?

Wait, maybe I should model the equation of motion. SHM is usually described by x(t) = A cos(ωt + φ), but since the initial displacement is zero, maybe it's better to write it as x(t) = A sin(ωt + φ). Let me think.

At t=0, x(0)=0. So substituting into x(t)=A sin(ωt + φ), we get 0 = A sin(φ). So either A=0, which can't be, or sin(φ)=0. So φ is 0 or π or multiples. But also, the initial velocity is v(0) = 0.1 m/s. The velocity is dx/dt = A ω cos(ωt + φ). At t=0, this becomes v(0) = A ω cos(φ). Since v(0) is positive, and cos(φ) must be positive, let's take φ=0 for simplicity. So x(t) = A sin(ωt).

But wait, if x(t)=A sin(ωt), then at t=0, x=0, which matches. The velocity is dx/dt = A ω cos(ωt). At t=0, v= A ω = 0.1 m/s. So A = 0.1/(ω) = 0.1 /14 ≈ 0.00714 m.

So the equation is x(t) = (0.1/14) sin(14 t).

Wait, so the question is when does x(t) become zero again. Well, x(t) is zero whenever sin(14t) is zero. Which happens at 14t = nπ, where n is integer. So t = nπ/14.

The first time after t=0 when x(t)=0 is when n=1, so t= π/14 s. But wait, in SHM, the mass passes through equilibrium every T/2, which is (π/7)/2 = π/14. So that makes sense.

Wait, but wait another moment. The initial velocity is downward, so the mass is moving towards the negative displacement. Wait, no, in this case, the equilibrium is the position where the spring is neither stretched nor compressed. So if the mass is at equilibrium and given a downward velocity, that would cause it to go into compression. So when does it return to equilibrium?

Wait, no. Wait, the initial condition is x=0, v=+0.1 m/s (assuming downward is positive). So the mass is moving in the positive direction. So it goes to maximum displacement at x=A, which is 0.1/14 ≈ 0.00714 m, but wait, no, wait. Because when you set a mass in motion from equilibrium with some velocity, the amplitude is determined by the maximum stretch or compression. So the amplitude A is (v_initial)/ω. Because for SHM, velocity amplitude is Aω = v_max. So A = v_initial / ω = 0.1 /14.

So the motion is sinusoidal, and the mass will pass through equilibrium every time it changes direction. So the first time it comes back is when t = T/2, which is (π/7)/2 = π/(14). So t=π/14 seconds.

Wait, but looking at the options, option J is π/14 s. So the correct answer should be J.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because when you release from equilibrium with a velocity, the time to return is indeed T/2, because it goes from equilibrium to max displacement and back in T/2 time. Wait, no. Wait, no, the period T is the time for a full cycle. So when you start at equilibrium moving in the positive direction, you reach max positive displacement at T/4, then back to equilibrium at T/2, then to max negative at 3T/4, and back to equilibrium at T. So the first time it comes back is at T/2. Wait, but wait, T is π/7 s, so T/2 is π/(14) s. Oh, yes, so the first time is at π/14.

But wait, in the problem, the mass is set in motion from its equilibrium position. So the initial displacement is zero, and initial velocity is 10 cm/s. So yes, the first return to equilibrium is at T/2. So that's correct.

So the answer should be J: π/14 s.

To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the mass-spring system. The mass is set in motion from its equilibrium position with an initial downward velocity, and there is no damping. This is a simple harmonic motion (SHM) scenario.

1. **Determine the spring constant ($k$):**  
   Using Hooke's Law, $F = kx$, where $F$ is the force applied and $x$ is the displacement. The force here is the weight of the mass, $F = mg = (0.1)(9.8) = 0.98 \, \mathrm{N}$. The displacement is $x = 0.05 \, \mathrm{m}$. Thus,  
   \[
   k = \frac{F}{x} = \frac{0.98}{0.05} = 19.6 \, \mathrm{N/m}.
   \]

2. **Calculate the angular frequency ($\omega$):**  
   The angular frequency of the system is given by $\omega = \sqrt{k/m}$. Substituting $k = 19.6 \, \mathrm{N/m}$ and $m = 0.1 \, \mathrm{kg}$,  
   \[
   \omega = \sqrt{\frac{19.6}{0.1}} = \sqrt{196} = 14 \, \mathrm{rad/s}.
   \]

3. **Determine the period ($T$):**  
   The period of SHM is $T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega}$. Substituting $\omega = 14 \, \mathrm{rad/s}$,  
   \[
   T = \frac{2\pi}{14} = \frac{\pi}{7} \, \mathrm{s}.
   \]

4. **Find the time to return to equilibrium:**  
   The mass is set in motion from its equilibrium position with a downward velocity. In SHM, the mass passes through the equilibrium position twice in one full period: once going in the positive direction and once in the negative direction. The first time it returns to equilibrium is at $T/2$. Substituting $T = \frac{\pi}{7}$,  
   \[
   t = \frac{T}{2} = \frac{\pi}{14} \, \mathrm{s}.
   \]

Thus, the mass first returns to its equilibrium position at $t = \frac{\pi}{14} \, \mathrm{s}$.

**Answer: J**
