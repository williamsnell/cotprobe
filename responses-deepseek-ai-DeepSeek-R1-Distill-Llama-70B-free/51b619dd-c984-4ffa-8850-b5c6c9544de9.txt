Question:

Following their law school graduation party, a graduate and his roommate were driving home in an automobile that was owned and operated by the graduate. As they were approaching an intersection, their vehicle collided with a motorcycle whose rider was seriously injured in the accident. The rider sued the graduate for operating his motor vehicle in excess of the speed limit. In addition, the roommate brought suit against the rider for operating his motorcycle negligently and driving through a red light. The roommate subsequently reached an out- of-court settlement with the graduate and dismissed the lawsuit against him. At trial against the rider, the roommate testified that he observed the rider drive his motorcycle through a red light and then swerve into the path of the graduate's automobile. In rebuttal, the rider offered into evidence the roommate's complaint against the graduate alleging that the latter was driving "at an excessively high rate of speed at the time the accident occurred. "The complaint is

Options:

A: admissible under the former testimony exception to the hearsay rule.
B: inadmissible, because it is considered hearsay.
C: admissible as a declaration against interest.
D: admissible, because the graduate consented to its use.
E: inadmissible, because the roommate is not a party to the lawsuit.
F: inadmissible, because the suit was dismissed as part of a compromise.
G: admissible under the business records exception to the hearsay rule.
H: admissible as a statement of fact.
I: admissible as a prior inconsistent statement.
J: admissible as an admission.

Okay, so I've got this evidence question here about hearsay exceptions. Let me try to break it down. 

The scenario is a car accident involving a graduate and his roommate. The motorcycle rider sued the graduate for speeding, and the roommate sued the rider for negligence, saying he ran a red light. Then the roommate settled with the graduate and dismissed his lawsuit. At trial, the roommate testified that the rider ran the red light and swerved into their car. Now, the rider is trying to use the roommate's complaint against the graduate, which alleged that the graduate was speeding.

The question is about the admissibility of that complaint. The options are from A to J, each giving a different reason.

First, I remember that hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. So the roommate's complaint is a written statement made earlier, which is being offered to show that the graduate was speeding. That would be hearsay because it's being used to prove the truth of the speeding allegation.

But wait, there are exceptions. I need to think about which exceptions apply here. The complaint is a pleading in a lawsuit, so it's a statement by a party. In civil cases, statements by a party-opponent are not considered hearsay under the Federal Rules. Oh wait, but the roommate isn't a party to this current lawsuit, is he? The current suit is between the rider and the roommate, or is it the rider suing the graduate? Wait, noâ€”the rider is suing the graduate, and the roommate is a witness. Or wait, no, the rider is the plaintiff in the case against the graduate, and the roommate is a witness for the defense. The roommate had sued the rider but then settled and dismissed his suit. So now, in the rider's case against the graduate, the roommate is testifying for the defense (the graduate's side), saying the rider ran a red light.

The roommate's complaint against the graduate alleged that the graduate was speeding. The rider wants to offer that complaint as evidence that the graduate was indeed speeding. But the roommate is now testifying that the rider was at fault. So the rider is trying to impeach the roommate's testimony by showing that the roommate previously said the graduate was speeding, thus implying that the roommate is inconsistent or lying now.

Wait, but the problem is about the admissibility of the complaint. So is the complaint hearsay?

The complaint is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the graduate was speeding. So it's hearsay unless an exception applies.

Possible exceptions: 

1. Admission by a party-opponent. Under FRE 801(d)(2), a statement is not hearsay if it's offered against a party and was made by the party's agent or someone else on behalf of the party. But here, the roommate isn't a party to this case. The roommate was a plaintiff in a different case against the rider, but that case was dismissed. So in the current case between the rider (plaintiff) and the graduate (defendant), the roommate is just a witness, not a party.

So the roommate's statement in the complaint against the graduate can't be used as an admission against the graduate because the graduate is a party here, but the statement was made by the roommate, who isn't the graduate's agent or someone else on their behalf. Wait, no, the roommate isn't a party in this trial. So maybe it's not an admission.

Another thought: The complaint is a pleading, and under FRE 801(d)(2), statements in a pleading may be admissible as admissions if they're made by a party. But the roommate isn't a party in this case, so his statements in his own pleadings against the graduate can't be used as admissions against the graduate in this trial. Because the roommate isn't opposing the graduate in this case; he's a witness.

So the complaint is hearsay. Are there other exceptions? Let me see the options.

Option A: former testimony exception. That applies when the testimony is from a prior proceeding, but the roommate is available to testify, so that might not apply. Plus, the complaint isn't testimony.

Option C: declaration against interest. That requires the statement to be against the declarant's interest at the time it was made. The complaint alleged the graduate was speeding, but if the roommate was suing the graduate, that's in his interest, not against it. So that exception doesn't apply.

Option I: prior inconsistent statement. For that, the statement must be given under oath and subject to cross, like in a deposition or prior testimony. The complaint is a pleading, which isn't testimony, so that exception doesn't apply. Plus, the roommate is testifying now, so the prior statement could be used to impeach, but it's still hearsay unless it's for impeachment purposes only, not for the truth.

Wait, but in this case, the rider is offering the complaint to prove that the graduate was speeding, which is the truth of the matter. So even if it's a prior inconsistent statement, using it for its truth would still be hearsay.

Option J: admissible as an admission. As I thought earlier, the roommate isn't a party here. So his statements can't be admissions against the graduate.

Wait, another angle: could it be non-hearsay because it's a statement of the roommate, who is a witness, and the graduate's attorney could have introduced it as a prior statement. But no, because the statement is from a pleading, which is hearsay unless it fits an exception.

Another thought: the complaint's allegations are statements the roommate made. Since the roommate is now a witness, could the graduate use the complaint as a prior inconsistent statement to impeach him? But the rider is offering it, not the graduate. Wait, in this scenario, the rider is the plaintiff. The roommate is testifying for the defense (the graduate's side), so the rider wants to impeach him. So the rider would offer the complaint to show that the roommate previously blamed the graduate, implying that the roommate is inconsistent now. But for that, the prior statement would need to be inconsistent with his current testimony.

But in terms of admissibility as evidence for the truth, it's still hearsay. Unless it's an admission. Alternatively, perhaps it's admissible under the "statement against interest" if it was against the roommate's interest when he made it. But when the roommate sued the graduate, alleging the graduate was speeding, that's in his interest because he's trying to prove the graduate was at fault. So it's not against his interest.

Alternatively, could it be a business record? No, it's a legal pleading, not a business record.

So if the complaint is hearsay, then the options are whether it's admissible under an exception. If not, then inadmissible as hearsay.

Looking at the options, option B says it's inadmissible because it's hearsay. Option F says inadmissible because the suit was dismissed as part of a compromise. Wait, under FRE 408, compromises are inadmissible to prove liability, but the complaint itself isn't necessarily barred by 408. The issue is whether the complaint is hearsay.

So if the complaint is hearsay and no exception applies, then it's inadmissible. So option B would be correct.

Wait, but option J says admissible as an admission. If the roommate was a party in this case, then yes, but he's not. So it's not an admission.

So the correct answer is B: inadmissible, because it's considered hearsay.

The scenario involves a car accident where the motorcycle rider sued the graduate for speeding, and the roommate, who had sued the rider for negligence, settled with the graduate and dismissed his lawsuit. At trial, the roommate testified that the rider ran a red light and swerved into the graduate's car. The rider sought to admit the roommate's complaint against the graduate, which alleged that the graduate was speeding, to rebut the roommate's testimony.

The complaint is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (that the graduate was speeding), making it hearsay. To be admissible, it must fall under a recognized exception to the hearsay rule. 

1. **Admission by a Party-Opponent (Option J):** The roommate is not a party to the current lawsuit, so his statement in the complaint cannot be treated as an admission by a party-opponent.
2. **Declaration Against Interest (Option C):** The complaint alleged the graduate was speeding, but this was made in the context of the roommate's lawsuit against the graduate. Since it was in the roommate's interest to prove the graduate's fault, it does not qualify as a statement against interest.
3. **Prior Inconsistent Statement (Option I):** While the complaint could theoretically be used to impeach the roommate's testimony, it is still hearsay if offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (that the graduate was speeding).
4. **Former Testimony (Option A):** The complaint is not testimony from a prior proceeding, so this exception does not apply.
5. **Business Records (Option G):** The complaint is a legal pleading, not a business record, so this exception does not apply.

Since the complaint is hearsay and no exception applies, it is inadmissible. The correct answer is:

**B: inadmissible, because it is considered hearsay.**

Answer: B
