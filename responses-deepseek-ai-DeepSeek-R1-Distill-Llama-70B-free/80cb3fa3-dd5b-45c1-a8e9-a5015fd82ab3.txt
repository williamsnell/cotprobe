Question:

Say the incidence of a disease D is about 5 cases per 100 people (i.e., P(D) = 0.05). Let Boolean random variable D mean a patient “has disease D” and let Boolean random variable TP stand for "tests positive." Tests for disease D are known to be very accurate in the sense that the probability of testing positive when you have the disease is 0.99, and the probability of testing negative when you do not have the disease is 0.97. What is P(D | TP), the posterior probability that you have disease D when the test is positive?

Options:

A: 0.0495
B: 0.02
C: 0.05
D: 0.1
E: 0.99
F: 0.635
G: 0.078
H: 0.25
I: 0.97

Okay, so I have this probability question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think step by step. The question is about disease testing and calculating the posterior probability that someone has the disease given that they tested positive. 

First, I remember that this is a classic Bayes' theorem problem. Bayes' theorem helps us find the probability of an event given prior knowledge of conditions related to the event. The formula is P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B). 

So in this case, I need to find P(D|TP), which is the probability that a person has the disease (D) given that they tested positive (TP). 

The information given:
- P(D) = 0.05. That's the incidence of the disease, so 5% of the population has it.
- The probability of testing positive when you have the disease, P(TP|D) is 0.99. So the test is very accurate when someone is sick.
- The probability of testing negative when you don't have the disease is 0.97. That means the test correctly identifies most healthy people as negative. 

Wait, but for the denominator in Bayes' theorem, I need P(TP), the overall probability of testing positive. How do I find that?

I think I can use the law of total probability. P(TP) is the sum of probabilities of testing positive in both the cases where the person has the disease and where they don't. So that's P(TP|D)*P(D) + P(TP|¬D)*P(¬D). 

We have P(TP|D) as 0.99 and P(D) as 0.05. P(¬D) is the complement of P(D), so that's 1 - 0.05 = 0.95. 

What about P(TP|¬D)? Well, if the test correctly identifies 97% of the healthy people as negative, that means the false positive rate is 1 - 0.97 = 0.03. So P(TP|¬D) is 0.03. 

So putting it all together:
P(TP) = (0.99 * 0.05) + (0.03 * 0.95)
Let me calculate each part. 

0.99 * 0.05 = 0.0495
0.03 * 0.95 = 0.0285
Adding them together: 0.0495 + 0.0285 = 0.078

So P(TP) is 0.078. 

Now applying Bayes' theorem:
P(D|TP) = [P(TP|D) * P(D)] / P(TP)
Which is (0.99 * 0.05) / 0.078

We already know 0.99*0.05 is 0.0495. So 0.0495 / 0.078.

Let me compute that. 0.0495 ÷ 0.078. Hmm, let's see. Let me write it as 495 ÷ 780, since 0.0495 is 495/10000 and 0.078 is 78/1000, but maybe easier to just compute the division.

So 495 ÷ 780. Let's see, both are divisible by 15. 495 ÷15 is 33, 780 ÷15 is 52. So 33/52 is approximately 0.6346. Wait, 33 divided by 52. Let's compute that.

52 into 33 is 0. So 0., then 52 into 330 is 6 times (6*52=312), subtract 312 from 330, gives 18. Bring down a 0: 180. 52 into 180 is 3 times (3*52=156), remainder 24. Next digit is 0, making 240. 52 into 240 is 4 times (208), remainder 32. Bring down 0: 320. 52 into 320 is 6 times (312), remainder 8. So so far, we have 0.6346... Approximately 0.635.

So the posterior probability is approximately 0.635, which is 63.5%. 

Looking at the options, option F is 0.635, which matches our calculation.

To calculate the posterior probability \( P(D | TP) \), we use Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(D | TP) = \frac{P(TP | D) \cdot P(D)}{P(TP)}
\]

### Given Data:
- \( P(D) = 0.05 \) (probability of having the disease)
- \( P(TP | D) = 0.99 \) (probability of testing positive given the disease)
- \( P(\neg D) = 1 - P(D) = 0.95 \) (probability of not having the disease)
- \( P(TP | \neg D) = 1 - 0.97 = 0.03 \) (probability of testing positive without the disease)

### Step 1: Calculate \( P(TP) \) using the law of total probability:
\[
P(TP) = P(TP | D) \cdot P(D) + P(TP | \neg D) \cdot P(\neg D)
\]
\[
P(TP) = (0.99 \cdot 0.05) + (0.03 \cdot 0.95)
\]
\[
P(TP) = 0.0495 + 0.0285 = 0.078
\]

### Step 2: Apply Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(D | TP) = \frac{P(TP | D) \cdot P(D)}{P(TP)} = \frac{0.99 \cdot 0.05}{0.078}
\]
\[
P(D | TP) = \frac{0.0495}{0.078} \approx 0.635
\]

### Final Answer:
The posterior probability that a patient has disease \( D \) given a positive test result is approximately **0.635**.

The correct option is **F**.
