Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is: "Which writer was concerned with the reaction of workers to key characteristics of bureaucracies?" The options are A through J, each corresponding to a different writer.

Hmm, I remember that bureaucracies were a big topic in sociology and organizational theory. I think Max Weber was the one who originally talked a lot about bureaucracies. He described them as having a hierarchical structure, clear rules, and impersonal interactions. But the question is about the reaction of workers to these characteristics. So maybe it's not Weber himself but someone else who studied how workers respond.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. There's also someone named Mayo. Oh right, Elton Mayo! He's known for the Hawthorne studies. Those studies were about worker productivity and the impact of social factors. Mayo and his team found that workers' morale and productivity could be influenced by factors like attention from management, social interactions, and working conditions, not just pay or hours. So this relates to how workers react to their work environment, which includes bureaucratic structures.

Another possibility is Maslow. Abraham Maslow talked about the hierarchy of needs, but I don't think he specifically focused on bureaucracies. His work is more about individual motivation rather than organizational structure reactions.

Then there's Merton. Robert Merton wrote about the dysfunctions of bureaucracies, like how rules can become too rigid, leading to inefficiencies. But that's more from the organizational perspective rather than workers' reactions.

Lewin, I think, was more into group dynamics and leadership styles. Not sure if he focused on bureaucracies specifically.

Taylor is Frederick Winslow Taylor, known for scientific management. He focused on efficiency and breaking down tasks, but again, not specifically on worker reactions to bureaucracy.

Durkheim and Marx were more into broader sociological theories. Marx talked about alienation in capitalist systems, which could relate, but the question is specifically about bureaucracies. I'm not sure if that's what the question is pointing to.

Gouldner wrote about patterns of industrial bureaucracy, but again, I think his focus was more on the organizational aspects rather than worker reactions.

So putting it all together, the question is about workers' reactions to bureaucracies. I think the Hawthorne studies by Mayo are about worker behavior and reactions to their work environment, which includes bureaucratic structures. So the answer should be Mayo, which is option C.

Wait, but I should double-check. Another angle: did any of these writers specifically look at how workers react to the characteristics of bureaucracy as defined by Weber? For example, Merton's work on the dysfunctions could be about how individuals in a bureaucracy might behave, but I think that's more about the organization's perspective.

Mayo's work, though, was definitely about workers' reactions and the social aspects affecting their behavior. So I'm pretty confident it's C: Mayo.

The question asks which writer focused on workers' reactions to key characteristics of bureaucracies. While Max Weber defined bureaucracies, the focus here is on worker reactions. Elton Mayo, through the Hawthorne studies, examined how social factors and work environments influence worker morale and productivity, making him the correct choice.

Answer: C
