Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because stoichiometry has always been a little tricky for me. But let's try to break it down step by step.

The problem says a chemist is reacting 2 grams of VO with 5.75 grams of Fe2O3 to produce V2O5 and FeO. I need to find out how many grams of V2O5 can be obtained. The options are A through J, so I'll have to calculate it and see which one matches.

First, I think I should write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction. The reactants are VO and Fe2O3, and the products are V2O5 and FeO. Let me try to balance this.

VO + Fe2O3 → V2O5 + FeO

Let's count the atoms on each side. Starting with vanadium: on the left, there's 1 V in VO. On the right, V2O5 has 2 V. So I'll need 2 moles of VO to balance the V. Let me put a 2 in front of VO.

2 VO → 2 V2O5? Wait, no. Wait, the product is V2O5, so maybe I need to adjust that.

Wait, let me approach it more systematically.

On the reactant side:
- VO: V is +2, O is -2. So VO has V^2+.
- Fe2O3: Fe is +3 each, O^-2 each. So Fe2O3 is Fe³+.

On the product side:
- V2O5: each V is +5 (because O is -2, 5 O's make -10, so 2 V's must be +10 total, so +5 each).
- FeO: Fe is +2 (O is -2 each).

So the reaction involves oxidation for V (from +2 in VO to +5 in V2O5) and reduction for Fe (from +3 in Fe2O3 to +2 in FeO). So it's a redox reaction. I think I'll need to split this into two half-reactions: oxidation and reduction.

First, the oxidation half-reaction: VO is oxidized to V2O5.

VO → V2O5

Balancing V first: 2 VO → V2O5. That balances V.

Now O: on the left, 2*(O from VO)= 2 O. On the right, V2O5 has 5 O. So the difference is 3 O on the right. So I'll add H2O to the left and H+ to the right to balance O, since it's likely an acidic solution.

2 VO → V2O5 + 3 H2O?

Wait, let me see:

Wait, VO → V2O5.

In acidic solution, so I can add H2O and H+.

So:

2 VO → V2O5 + 3 H2O ?

Wait, let's count O on each side. Left: 2*(1 O) = 2 O. Right: V2O5 has 5 O, plus 3 H2O has 3*1 O each? Wait no, 3 H2O has 3*(O) each, so 3 O. So total O on right is 5 + 3*1=8? Wait, no, that's not right. Let me recount.

Wait, no, in the equation 2 VO → V2O5, the O's are 2 on the left, 5 on the right. So the difference is 5 - 2 = 3 O needed on the left. So I can add 3 H2O to the left to get 3 more O. Or wait, maybe to the right?

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me write:

Oxidation half-reaction (V is oxidized):

VO → V2O5

V goes from +2 to +5, so each V loses 3 electrons. Since there are 2 V in V2O5, total electrons lost would be 2 * 3 = 6 electrons.

Now, balancing the equation:

VO → V2O5

First, balance V: 2 VO → V2O5.

O: 2*1 = 2 O on left. V2O5 has 5 O on right. So difference is 3 O. Add 3 H2O to the left to add 3 O:

2 VO + 3 H2O → V2O5

Now, balance H. On the left, 3 H2O gives 6 H. On the right, we can add H+ to balance.

So 2 VO + 3 H2O → V2O5 + 6 H+

Now, check charges. On left: 2 VO (each V^2+ and O^2-; so each VO is neutral, so 2 VO is neutral. 3 H2O is neutral. So left side charge is 0.

On the right: V2O5 is neutral. 6 H+ → +6.

So the left is 0, right is +6. To balance, we add 6 electrons to the right (since it's oxidation, electrons are lost, so they are on the right).

So the oxidation half-reaction becomes:

2 VO + 3 H2O → V2O5 + 6 H+ + 6 e^-

Now, the reduction half-reaction: Fe^3+ is reduced to Fe^2+.

Fe^3+ → Fe^2+

Each Fe gains 1 electron. So to balance electrons, we'll have:

Fe^3+ + e^- → Fe^2+

But since in the oxidation half-reaction, 6 electrons are released, the reduction must involve 6 electrons. So we'll multiply the reduction half-reaction by 6.

6 Fe^3+ + 6 e^- → 6 Fe^2+

Now, combine the two half-reactions:

Oxidation: 2 VO + 3 H2O → V2O5 + 6 H+ + 6 e^-

Reduction: 6 Fe^3+ + 6 e^- → 6 Fe^2+

Add them together:

2 VO + 3 H2O + 6 Fe^3+ + 6 e^- → V2O5 + 6 H+ + 6 e^- + 6 Fe^2+

Wait, the electrons cancel out.

So:

2 VO + 3 H2O + 6 Fe^3+ → V2O5 + 6 H+ + 6 Fe^2+

But let's simplify the H+ and H2O. On the left, we have 3 H2O (which is 6 H and 3 O), and on the right, 6 H+ (which is 6 H). So net H: 6 H on right, 6 H on left from H2O. So the H+ can be combined with H2O to form H3O+ or something, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the overall equation.

Wait, maybe I should write the overall equation without the half-reactions. Alternatively, perhaps the overall equation needs to be balanced with the correct stoichiometric coefficients.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write the whole reaction again.

The overall reaction, after combining the half-reactions, is:

2 VO + 6 Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → V2O5 + 6 Fe^2+ + 6 H+

But wait, Fe^3+ is in Fe2O3. So perhaps I should express Fe2O3 in the equation.

Wait, Fe2O3 dissociates into 2 Fe^3+ + 3 O^2- in solution, but maybe in the reaction, it's acting as a source of Fe^3+.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Let me think of the overall balanced equation.

Another approach: The products are V2O5 and FeO. So perhaps the balanced equation is:

VO + Fe2O3 → V2O5 + FeO

Let me count each element.

VO has V and O.
Fe2O3 has Fe and O.
On product side, V2O5 has V and O, FeO has Fe and O.

Let me balance each element.

V: 1 on left (VO), 2 in V2O5 → so I'll need 2 VO.

Fe: 2 in Fe2O3, 1 in FeO → so I'll need 2 FeO.

So let me try:

2 VO + Fe2O3 → V2O5 + 2 FeO

Now, let's check O:

Left: 2*(1 O from VO) + 3 O from Fe2O3 → 2 +3=5 O.

Right: 5 O from V2O5 + 2*(1 O from FeO)=5+2=7 O.

Hmm, that's not balanced. So O is 5 on left and 7 on right. Need to balance.

So perhaps we need to add O by adding H2O or something. Wait, maybe the problem is that I'm not considering the oxygen from the Fe2O3 and VO correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the half-reactions but include the actual compounds.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the method of balancing by assigning variables.

Let me try assigning variables.

Let’s say the balanced equation is:

a VO + b Fe2O3 → c V2O5 + d FeO

We need to find a, b, c, d.

Let's balance each element:

V: a = 2c → because VO has a V, V2O5 has 2 V per molecule.

Fe: 2b = d → Fe2O3 has 2 Fe per molecule, FeO has 1 Fe.

O is a bit more complicated. Let's count O on each side.

Left O: VO contributes a *1, Fe2O3 contributes b *3. So total O = a + 3b.

Right O: V2O5 contributes c *5, FeO contributes d *1. So O = 5c + d.

So the O equation is a + 3b = 5c + d.

We have from V: a = 2c.

From Fe: 2b = d → d = 2b.

Substituting a and d in terms of c and b into O equation:

2c + 3b = 5c + 2b → 2c + 3b -5c -2b = 0 → -3c + b = 0 → b = 3c.

So let's express everything in terms of c.

a = 2c
b = 3c
d = 2b = 6c

So the equation is:

2c VO + 3c Fe2O3 → c V2O5 + 6c FeO

We can divide by c (assuming c ≠ 0) to get the simplest whole number ratio.

So:

2 VO + 3 Fe2O3 → V2O5 + 6 FeO

Now let's check if this is balanced.

V: 2 on left (2 VO) → 2 in V2O5 (right). Correct.

Fe: 3 Fe2O3 → 6 Fe → 6 FeO, which has 6 Fe. Correct.

O: Left: 2*(1) from VO + 3*(3) from Fe2O3 → 2 + 9 = 11 O.

Right: 5 from V2O5 + 6*(1) from FeO →5+6=11 O. Balanced. Yes!

So the balanced equation is 2 VO + 3 Fe2O3 → V2O5 + 6 FeO.

Wait, but earlier when I tried without the half-reactions, I didn't get that. So I must have made a mistake earlier, but this way it's correct.

So now that I have the balanced equation, the next step is to determine the limiting reactant, because the problem gives specific masses of VO and Fe2O3.

The given masses are:

VO: 2 grams

Fe2O3: 5.75 grams

So I'll need to convert each to moles, using their molar masses, and then see which is the limiting reactant.

Molar masses:

VO: V is about 50.94 g/mol, O is 16.00 → 50.94 +16=66.94 g/mol.

Fe2O3: Fe is 55.85, O is 16.00 → 2*(55.85) +3*(16)= 111.7 +48=159.7 g/mol.

So moles of VO:

2 g / 66.94 g/mol ≈ 0.0299 moles.

Moles of Fe2O3:

5.75 g / 159.7 g/mol ≈ 0.0360 moles.

From the balanced equation, the mole ratio is 2 VO : 3 Fe2O3.

So for the reaction to proceed, the required mole ratio is 2:3.

Let me see how much Fe2O3 is needed for the VO present, and vice versa.

Moles required for VO to react completely:

For 2 moles of VO, need 3 moles Fe2O3.

So per mole of VO, need 3/2 moles of Fe2O3.

So for 0.0299 moles VO, needed Fe2O3 is 0.0299 * (3/2) = 0.04485 moles.

Available Fe2O3 is 0.0360 moles.

0.04485 needed > 0.0360 available → So Fe2O3 is the limiting reactant.

Alternatively, let's compute how much VO is needed for all Fe2O3 to react.

For 3 moles Fe2O3, need 2 moles VO.

So per mole Fe2O3, need 2/3 mole VO.

Available Fe2O3 is 0.0360 moles → VO needed = 0.0360 * (2/3) ≈ 0.0240 moles.

Available VO is 0.0299 moles > 0.0240 needed → So Fe2O3 limits.

So Fe2O3 is the limiting reactant.

Now, with Fe2O3 as the limiting reactant, let's compute how much V2O5 can be formed.

From the balanced equation, 3 moles Fe2O3 produce 1 mole V2O5.

So moles of V2O5 = moles Fe2O3 * (1 mole V2O5 / 3 moles Fe2O3)

Moles Fe2O3 = 5.75 g / 159.7 g/mol ≈ 0.0360 mol.

So V2O5 moles = 0.0360 * (1/3) ≈ 0.0120 mol.

Now, calculate the mass of V2O5.

Molar mass of V2O5: V is 50.94 *2=101.88; O is 16*5=80 → total 181.88 g/mol.

Mass = moles * molar mass = 0.0120 * 181.88 ≈ 2.18 grams.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation for any errors.

Wait, let me recalculate.

Molar mass of Fe2O3: 2*(55.85) +3*(16) = 111.7 +48=159.7 g/mol. Correct.

Moles of Fe2O3: 5.75 /159.7 → let me compute that more accurately.

5.75 ÷ 159.7 → 5.75 ÷ 160 ≈ 0.0359, but more precisely:

159.7 × 0.036 = 5.7452 → So 5.75 is 5.7452 +0.0048 → 0.036 + (0.0048/159.7) ≈ 0.036 + 0.00003 →≈ 0.03603 moles.

So 0.03603 moles Fe2O3.

Molar ratio: 3 Fe2O3 → 1 V2O5.

So V2O5 moles = 0.03603 /3 = 0.01201 mol.

Molar mass of V2O5: 2 V = 2*(50.94)=101.88; 5 O=80 → 181.88 g/mol.

Mass = 0.01201 * 181.88 → let's compute:

0.01 *181.88 =1.8188

0.00201 *181.88 → 0.002 *181.88=0.36376; 0.00001*181.88=0.0018188 → total 0.3655788.

So 1.8188 + 0.3655788 ≈ 2.1843788 grams → approximately 2.18 grams.

Looking at the options, option D is 2.18 g.

Wait, but let me check if I made any mistake elsewhere. For instance, in the balanced equation, I had 3 Fe2O3 → 1 V2O5. So yes, that's correct.

Another check: If Fe2O3 is the limiting reactant, then the maximum amount of V2O5 is based on Fe2O3.

Yes, so the answer should be 2.18 grams, which is option D.
</think>

To determine how many grams of V₂O₅ can be obtained, we start by balancing the chemical equation for the reaction:

\[
2 \, \text{VO} + 3 \, \text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3 \rightarrow \text{V}_2\text{O}_5 + 6 \, \text{FeO}
\]

This equation shows the stoichiometric relationships between the reactants and products. Next, we calculate the moles of each reactant using their molar masses:

- **Molar mass of VO**: \( 50.94 + 16.00 = 66.94 \, \text{g/mol} \)
- **Molar mass of Fe₂O₃**: \( 2(55.85) + 3(16.00) = 159.7 \, \text{g/mol} \)

Given masses:
- Moles of VO:  
  \[
  \frac{2 \, \text{g}}{66.94 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.0299 \, \text{mol}
  \]
- Moles of Fe₂O₃:  
  \[
  \frac{5.75 \, \text{g}}{159.7 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.0360 \, \text{mol}
  \]
