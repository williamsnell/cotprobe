Okay, so I've got this psychology question here about classical conditioning. Hmm, I remember that classical conditioning was discovered by Ivan Pavlov, right? He did those experiments with dogs and bells. The question is about what happens when a conditioned response has been acquired, and then the procedure changes so that the conditioned stimulus (CS) is presented repeatedly without the unconditioned stimulus (UCS).

Wait, so let me think. Classical conditioning involves associating a neutral stimulus with an unconditioned stimulus to elicit a response. So the CS is like the bell, and the UCS is the food. When the bell rings and then food comes, the dog starts salivating at the bell alone. That's the conditioned response.

But now, after this has happened, they're changing the procedure. Instead of ringing the bell (CS) and then giving food (UCS), they're just ringing the bell without the food. What happens then? I think this is about extinction. Because Pavlov talked about extinction when the CS is presented without the UCS, the conditioned response decreases and eventually disappears.

So the question is asking, what's the result of this procedure? The options are from A to J. Let me go through them.

Option A: Intermittent reinforcement. Wait, reinforcement is more of operant conditioning, right? Like Skinner's stuff, where behavior is followed by a reward. So this might not apply here.

Option B: Habituation. Habituation is when a stimulus that's presented repeatedly without any reinforcement leads to a decreased response. But isn't habituation a different concept? Like, it's a type of learning where you stop responding to something because it's irrelevant. But in this case, the CS was previously paired with the UCS. So I'm not sure if it's habituation or extinction.

Option C: Transformation of conditioned behavior. Not sure what that means. Maybe changing into a different type of response? Doesn't ring a bell.

Option D: Emergence of a new unconditioned response. Unconditioned responses are innate, like salivating when food is in your mouth. I don't see how that would happen here. They're just stopping the UCS, so probably not a new UCR.

Option E: No change. That can't be right, because if you stop pairing the CS with the UCS, the response should change. It should decrease.

Option F: Increased resistance to extinction. Wait, extinction is when the response goes away. If you have intermittent reinforcement, that makes behavior more resistant to extinction, but that's operant again. Here, if you're presenting the CS without the UCS, that's the extinction process itself, so resistance shouldn't increase.

Option G: Strengthening of the response. No, that doesn't make sense. If you stop reinforcing, the response should get weaker, not stronger.

Option H: Spontaneous recovery. Oh, right, after extinction, if you wait, the response can come back. But that's after the extinction process has happened. So in this question, they're in the process of extinguishing, so spontaneous recovery is a separate thing.

Option I: Extinction. Yes, that's what I was thinking. When the CS is presented without the UCS, the conditioned response extinguishes, meaning it stops happening.

Option J: Generalization. That's when the response occurs to similar stimuli, like a different bell sound. But the question isn't about varying the CS, just presenting it without the UCS.

So putting it together, the correct answer should be I: Extinction of conditioned respondent behavior.

The question involves classical conditioning, specifically what happens when a conditioned stimulus (CS) is repeatedly presented without the unconditioned stimulus (UCS) after a conditioned response has been acquired. Classical conditioning, as demonstrated by Ivan Pavlov, involves associating a neutral stimulus (CS) with an unconditioned stimulus (UCS) to elicit a conditioned response. If the CS is presented without the UCS, the conditioned response gradually decreases and eventually disappears. This process is known as extinction.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Intermittent reinforcement** refers to operant conditioning, not classical conditioning, and is irrelevant here.
- **B: Habituation** is a different concept where a response decreases due to repeated presentation of a stimulus without any reinforcement, but it does not apply here since the CS was previously paired with the UCS.
- **C: Transformation of conditioned behavior** is unclear and not relevant to the scenario.
- **D: Emergence of a new unconditioned response** is incorrect because unconditioned responses are innate and not affected by this procedure.
- **E: No change** is incorrect because stopping the UCS should lead to a decrease in the conditioned response.
- **F: Increased resistance to extinction** is incorrect because this scenario describes the extinction process itself.
- **G: Strengthening of the response** is incorrect because the response should weaken, not strengthen.
- **H: Spontaneous recovery** refers to the reappearance of a conditioned response after extinction, but this occurs after extinction, not during the process described.
- **I: Extinction** is correct because repeatedly presenting the CS without the UCS leads to the disappearance of the conditioned response.
- **J: Generalization** refers to responding to similar stimuli, which is not relevant here.

The correct answer is **I: Extinction of conditioned respondent behavior**.
