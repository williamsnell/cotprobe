Okay, so I've got this DNA question to solve. Let me read it carefully. The question is about finding the complementary strand to a given DNA sequence. Hmm, I remember that DNA strands are antiparallel and complementary, right?

The given sequence is 5' CGA TTG 3'. Wait, wait. So DNA strands run from 5' to 3'. The complementary strand should run in the opposite direction. Oh right, so the given strand is 5' to 3', so the complementary should be 3' to 5', but I think when we write it, we usually write the 5' to 3' direction. So maybe I need to reverse the complement.

Let me think about how DNA base pairing works. Adenine pairs with Thymine, and Cytosine pairs with Guanine. So I need to find the complementary bases and then reverse them because the strands are antiparallel.

The original sequence is C G A T T G. Wait no, wait. Wait, the sequence is 5' CGA TTG 3'. Let me write each base in order:

C G A T T G. Oh wait, wait. Wait, the sequence is CGATTG. So each letter is C, G, A, T, T, G.

To find the complementary strand, I need to pair each base with its complement. So C pairs with G, G with C, A with T, T with A, T with A, G with C. So the complementary bases would be G C T A A C. But wait, since the original strand is 5' to 3', the complementary strand would be written in 3' to 5'. So if I take the complementary sequence, it would be the reverse of GCTAAC.

Wait, no, let me think again. If the original is 5' CGA TTG 3', the complementary strand, which is antiparallel, would be 3' GCTAAC 5'. But when we write the complementary strand, we write it 5' to 3', so we need to reverse it. So the complementary in 5' to 3' is C A A G T C? Wait, wait no. Let me write it step by step.

Original: 5' C G A T T G 3'

Complementary bases (in 3' direction): 3' G C T A A C 5'

But since we usually write from 5' to 3', we reverse that to get 5' C A A T G C 3'?

Wait, no wait. Let me correct this. The original is 5' CGATTG 3'. The complementary strand's bases would be G C T A A C, but in the opposite direction. So the complementary strand is written as 5' CAAAGTC 3'? No, wait, wait.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write the complementary in reverse. So each base in reverse order.

Original: C G A T T G

Take each base and write the complement in reverse.

So take the original, reverse the order, then take the complement of each.

Wait, let me try this:

Original: C G A T T G (positions 1 to 6)

Reversed: G T T A G C

Now, take the complement of each:

G → C

T → A

T → A

A → T

G → C

C → G

So the complementary strand is C A A T C G.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, the correct way is for each base in the original, the complementary is the pairing, but the direction is opposite.

So the original is 5' C G A T T G 3'

The complementary strand would be 3' G C T A A C 5'

But when written in 5' to 3' direction, it's the reverse of that, so 5' C A A T G C 3'

Wait, no. Let me think again. So the original is 5' CGATTG 3'. The complementary is 3' GCTAAC 5'. But that's written from 3' to 5'; when we write it 5' to 3', it's the reverse of that, so 5' CTAAAGC? No, wait, no, wait no.

Wait, let's take the complementary strand as 3' G C T A A C 5'. To write it as 5' to 3', we reverse it, so it becomes 5' C A A T C G 3' (Wait, no… hold on. Let me write it correctly.)

The complementary strand is built as: for each nucleotide in the original, from 5' to 3', the complementary is built from 3' to 5'. So the complementary sequence is 3' G C T A A C 5'. But when we present it as a strand in 5' to 3' direction, we reverse the order of the nucleotides.

So the complementary strand in 5' to 3' is the reverse of G C T A A C. So the reverse would be C A A T G C.

Wait, no. Let me take the complementary strand as 3' G C T A A C 5', which is the complement of the original. So when written in the 5' to 3' direction, it's the reverse of GCTAAC, which is CAAGTC.

Wait, wait. Let me write it step by step.

Original: 5' C G A T T G 3'

Complementary (antiparallel): 3' G C T A A C 5'

Now, to write this as a 5' to 3' strand, we reverse the order of the complementary bases. So G C T A A C becomes C A A T G C when reversed.

Wait, but wait. Wait, G C T A A C is the complementary strand in the 3' to 5' direction. Reversing the order gives C A A T G C, which is 5' to 3' direction.

So the complementary strand is 5' CAA TGC 3' ?

Wait, but let me look at the options. The options are given as 5' to 3'. So the correct complementary strand would be 5' CAA TGC 3'? Wait, no, that's 5' C A A T G C 3', which would be option I: 5' CAA TCG 3'... Wait, no, let me look.

Wait, the options are:

A: 5' TCGAAT 3'

B: 5' GTTAGC 3'

C: 5' GCUAAC 3'

D: 5' GTTCGA 3'

E: 5' TTACGC 3'

F: 5' AGCTTA 3'

G: 5' CGATTG 3'

H: 5' GCTAAC 3'

I: 5' CAATCG 3'

J: 5' ACGTTA 3'

Wait, so according to what I thought, the complementary strand is 5' CAA TGC 3', but looking at the options, I don't see that. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me go back. Original strand: 5' C G A T T G 3'

Complement is 3' G C T A A C 5'

So when written in 5' to 3', it is C A A T G C, which is 5' CAATGC 3'.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option H: 5' GCTAAC 3' → That's G C T A A C.

Option C: 5' GCU AAC 3' → G C U A A C? Wait, wait, wait. No, the options are all DNA, so U is not present. So perhaps that's a typo. But in the given options, option C is 5' GCU AAC 3' → no, but DNA uses T instead of U, so maybe that's not applicable.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me try another approach.

The original is 5' CGATTG 3'. To find the complementary, we pair each base and reverse the direction.

So each base in original: C → G, G → C, A → T, T → A, T → A, G → C.

So the complementary bases in order would be G, C, T, A, A, C.

But since the original is 5' to 3', the complementary strand is 3' to 5', so the order is reversed. So the complementary strand as written in 5' to 3' direction would be the reverse of G C T A A C, which is C A A T G C.

So 5' C A A T G C 3' → which is CAATGC. Now, look for that in the options.

Looking at the options: Let's see. Option H is 5' GCTAAC 3' → that's GCTAAC. No, that's the same as G C T A A C. So that's the complementary in 5' to 3' direction? No, wait, no. Wait, the complementary strand in 3' to 5' is GCTAAC. So when written as 5' to 3', it's the reverse, which is CAATGC.

Wait, none of the options have CAATGC. Hmm. Let me check each option again.

Option I: 5' CAATCG 3' → CAATCG.

Wait, that's C A A T C G. Hmm, wait. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the pairing.

Wait, original is C G A T T G.

So each base: C → G, G→C, A→T, T→A, T→A, G→C.

So the complementary in 3' to 5' is G C T A A C.

So when reversed for 5' to 3' direction, it's C A A T G C.

Wait, but that's 6 letters. Let me count the letters in each option. The original is 6 bases, so the complement should be 6 as well.

Looking at the options:

Option C: GCUAAC → 6 bases. G C U A A C → but no, since it's DNA, it's T instead of U. So this is probably a typo, and it's meant to be GCTAAC, but I'll put that aside for now.

Option H: GCTAAC → 6 bases.

Wait, but wait. The original is CGATTG.

So the complementary strand is GCTAAC, but in the 3' to 5' direction. When written as 5' to 3', it's the reverse, which is CAATGC.

So the correct complementary strand in 5' to 3' is CAATGC. But none of the options exactly match that.

Wait, looking again:

Option I: 5' CAATCG 3' → C A A T C G.

Wait, that's six letters. Let me check each base.

Original: C G A T T G → positions 1-6.

Complement: G C T A A C.

Reverse to get 5' to 3': C A A T G C.

So that's C A A T G C.

Looking at the options, option H is GCTAAC, which is 5' GCTAAC 3', which is the same as the original's complement before reversing.

Wait, so perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try pairing each base again.

Original: 5' C G A T T G 3'

Each base's complement:

C → G

G → C

A → T

T → A

T → A

G → C

So the complementary strand is 3' G C T A A C 5'

Which is 3' GCTAAC 5'

But when written as 5' to 3', it's the reverse of this, so 5' C A A T G C 3', which is CAATGC.

Looking at the options, is there any option that is CAATGC?

Looking again:

Option I: CAATCG → C A A T C G

No, the last two letters are CG, but should be GC.

Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order. Let me double-check the original.

Wait, the original is 5' CGATTG 3', which is C G A T T G.

So the complementary bases are G C T A A C.

Wait, so the complementary strand is 3' G C T A A C 5', which is GCTAAC in 5' to 3' → wait, no. Wait, 3' GCTAAC 5' → when written 5' to 3', it's CAATGC.

Wait, CAATGC. Let's look for that in the options.

Looking through the options: A: TCGAAT → no. B: GTTAGC → no. C: GCUAAC → no, but it's GCTAAC if T instead of U. D: GTTCGA → no. E: TTACGC → no. F: AGCTTA → no. G: same as original → no. H: GCTAAC → which is GCTAAC. Oh, wait, H is 5' GCTAAC 3'. That's the complement of the original, but written in 5' to 3' direction, which would make it the same as the original's complement in 3' to 5', but that's not right. Because the complementary strand should be the reverse complement.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me think again.

The correct complementary strand of 5' CGATTG 3' is 3' GCTAAC 5', which, when read from 5' to 3', is 5' CAATGC 3'. So the correct answer should be a strand that is CAATGC.

Looking at the options, I don't see that. So perhaps I made a mistake in how I'm approaching this.

Wait another approach: perhaps the question is asking which of the options is the complement, regardless of direction. Because sometimes, people get confused between the complement and the reverse complement.

Wait, the question says "would be complementary to the sequence". So the complementary sequence would be the reverse complement.

So the options must be the reverse complement of the original.

Wait, the original is CGATTG.

The reverse complement is the complement read in reverse. So first, take the complement: GCTAAC, then reverse it to get CAATGC, which is 5' CAATGC 3'.

Looking at the options again, none of the options seem to have CAATGC. Wait, option H is GCTAAC, which is the complement, but not the reverse complement.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck each step.

Wait, another approach: write the original and then write the complementary as per direction.

Original: 5' C G A T T G 3'

Complementary strand (antiparallel): 3' G C T A A C 5'

But when written as 5' to 3', it's 5' C A A T G C 3'.

So the correct complementary strand is 5' CAATGC 3'.

Looking at options:

Option I is 5' CAATCG 3' → C A A T C G.

Hmm, that's different from CAATGC. So perhaps I made a mistake in the pairing.

Wait, maybe I should pair each base again.

C → G

G → C

A → T

T → A

T → A

G → C.

So the complementary bases, in reverse order (since the original is 5' →3', the complement is written 3' →5', so to get 5'→3', we reverse the order of the complement).

So original: positions 1-6: C G A T T G.

Complement bases in order (position 6 to 1): G C T A A C → but that's for 3'→5'.

Wait, no, wait. Maybe I should take the original, write the complement in reverse order.

Original: C G A T T G → positions 1-6.

Complement of each base: G C T A A C.

But since the strand is antiparallel, the complement is written in reverse order, so the complementary strand is the reverse of G C T A A C, which is C A A T G C.

So 5' CAATGC 3'.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the options have a typo, or I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me look at each option:

Option H: 5' GCTAAC 3' → that's the complement in the same direction as the original. So that's the same as the original's complement without reversing.

Wait, the original is 5' CGATTG 3' → complement is 3' GCTAAC 5' → which is option H's sequence but written as 5' GCTAAC 3', which would be the reverse of the correct complementary.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option H, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the reverse complement of CGATTG.

CGATTG → Reverse is GTTACG → complement is C A A T G C.

Wait, no, reverse of CGATTG is GTTACG, then take the complement.

Wait, no, reverse complement is taking the complement and then reversing it. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the reverse complement is formed by two steps: first, write the complement, then reverse it.

So the original is 5' C G A T T G 3'.

Step 1: Complement each base → 3' G C T A A C 5'.

Step 2: Reverse the complement → 5' C A A T G C 3'.

So the correct sequence is CAATGC.

Looking at the options, I don't see that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the process. Let me try another approach: write the complementary strand as per each option.

Which option's sequence, when paired with the original, would be complementary?

Original: 5' C G A T T G 3'

Option I: 5' C A A T C G 3'

So let's write the original and option I's sequence:

Original: C G A T T G

Option I: C A A T C G

Wait, but that doesn't seem to pair correctly. Let me see:

If the original is 5' C G A T T G 3', the complementary should be 3' G C T A A C 5', which is option H: 5' G C T A A C 3' (since H is 5' GCTAAC 3').

Wait, but H is written as 5' GCTAAC 3',
