Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again.

The problem says there's a charge of 20 nC uniformly distributed along a straight rod of length 4.0 meters. Then the rod is bent into a circular arc with a radius of 2.0 meters. I need to find the magnitude of the electric field at the center of curvature of the arc.

Hmm. Alright, let's break this down. I remember that when dealing with electric fields due to charge distributions, symmetry plays a big role. Since the rod is bent into a circular arc, the setup has cylindrical symmetry around the center of the circle. 

Wait, but the rod is straight initially. Oh, right, when it's bent into a circular arc, the length becomes the length of the arc. So wait, the length of the rod is 4.0 meters, and when bent into a circle, that length would be the arc length. So the central angle would determine how much of a circle we're talking about.

The formula for arc length is s = rθ, where θ is in radians. Oh, right, because s is the arc length, r the radius. So here, s is 4.0 m, r is 2.0 m. So θ = s/r = 4/2 = 2 radians. So the rod forms an arc of 2 radians, which is a bit more than 114 degrees (since π radians is 180, so 2 radians is about 114.6 degrees).

So the charge is distributed along this arc. The charge per unit length (linear charge density) would be λ = Q / L, where L is the length of the rod, which is 4.0 m. So λ is 20 nC / 4 m. Let me calculate that: 20e-9 C /4 =5e-9 C/m. So λ is 5 nC/m.

But wait, when the rod is bent into a circular arc, each small segment of charge will contribute to the electric field at the center. So I need to model this as a series of point charges arranged in an arc and find the electric field vector at the center.

Since the charge distribution is uniform, each infinitesimal segment of the arc will have a charge dq = λ ds, where ds is the length element along the arc. The electric field from each dq at the center can be found using dE = (1/(4πε₀)) * (dq / r²) * r_hat, where r_hat is the unit vector pointing from dq to the center.

Wait, no, wait. The distance from each dq to the center is r, which is given as 2.0 m. So each dq contributes an electric field at the center of magnitude dE = (1/(4πε₀)) * (dq) / r². But the direction of each dE will depend on the position of dq along the arc. So I need to integrate the contributions from all the dq's, considering their directions.

But wait, due to the symmetry, the electric field is radial, pointing from the arc to the center. However, since the arc is not a full circle, the contributions won't cancel out in all directions. Wait, no, because the setup is symmetric around the axis of the circle. So the electric field contributions from symmetric points on the arc will add up along the axis perpendicular to the arc's plane.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me think again. The arc lies in a plane, and the center is at the center of curvature. Each dq is a point on the arc, and the electric field from dq is directed along the line connecting dq to the center. Since the arc is symmetric around the center, for every dq at an angle θ, there's another at -θ. So, for components of the electric field in the plane of the arc, their contributions would cancel in some directions but add in others.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as a two-dimensional problem. Let's imagine the arc is in the x-y plane, and the center is at the origin. Each dq is located at some point (r, φ), where φ ranges from -θ/2 to θ/2 (since the total angle is θ=2 radians). The electric field from each dq at the origin can be broken into components. Let's see.

The electric field vector from a point charge dq is radial, so it points directly away from dq (since it's positive charge, assuming the charge is positive) towards the center. Wait, no, wait: the problem says the charge is 20 nC, but doesn't specify the sign. Oh, wait, but the question is about the magnitude, so maybe the sign doesn't matter here. But for the direction, the electric field would point away from positive charges and towards negative ones. But since the charge is positive (I think the default is positive unless stated otherwise), the field points away from each dq towards the center? No, wait, no. Because the center is the center of curvature, so each dq is on the arc, and the electric field direction from a positive charge is away from it. So each dq is a positive charge, so the electric field at the center would point away from each dq, which is towards the center of curvature. Wait, no, no. Wait, when you have a positive charge, the electric field points away from it. So each dq is on the circumference of the circle. The center is the center of the circle. So from each dq, the electric field at the center would point directly away from dq, which is towards the center of curvature. So each dE vector points towards the center? No, that can't be. Wait no—if you have a positive charge at a point on the circumference, the electric field at the center is pointing away from that charge, meaning directly away from the charge. Since the charge is on the circumference, the field at the center would point in the direction from the charge to the center. Wait, no. Let me clarify.

Imagine a positive charge at (r, 0). The electric field at the origin (0,0) due to this charge would point directly away from (r,0), which would be along the positive x-axis towards the origin? Wait no, no. Wait, origin is at the center of the circle. The charge is at (r,0), so the electric field at the origin would be pointing towards the origin because the field is created by a positive charge and points away from it. So from (r,0), the field direction at the origin is towards (-x) direction, i.e., pointing to the left.

Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, if the charge is at (r,0), which is a point on the positive x-axis, then the electric field at the origin (0,0) would be a vector pointing away from (r,0). So that's pointing in the negative x direction. Because the field from a positive charge points away from it, so from (r,0) towards the origin, which is to the left (negative x direction). So the field vector at origin from this charge is (-dE, 0).

Similarly, a charge at (r, π) (opposite side) would produce a field pointing away from it, which is towards the origin, so in the positive x direction.

Wait, but in our case, the rod is an arc of angle 2 radians. Let me model this as an arc from angle -θ/2 to θ/2, where θ is 2 radians. So θ/2 is 1 radian. So the charges are located from φ = -1 rad to φ = +1 rad around the circle.

Now, each dq would contribute a dE vector at the center. To find the total electric field, I need to sum all these dE vectors.

But because of symmetry, the electric field vectors in the y-direction (perpendicular to the plane of the arc) will cancel out. Because for each dq at angle φ, there's a corresponding dq at angle -φ, and their y-components will be opposite, so they cancel when summed. Similarly, the x-components from each dq will add up constructively because they're all pointing in the same direction.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Oh wait, the problem is that the arc isn't a full circle, so each point on the arc will have a unique position, but their contributions in certain directions may cancel. Let me consider the components.

Each dq at angle φ will contribute an electric field dE with components:

dEx = dE * cos(φ)
dEy = dE * sin(φ)

But when you integrate over the symmetric interval from -θ/2 to θ/2, the dEy components from φ and -φ will cancel each other because sin(-φ) = -sin(φ). So the total Ey will be zero. The Ex components will add up because cos(φ) is even, so they will sum to twice the integral from 0 to θ/2.

Wait, but wait, in our earlier example, for the charge at (r,0), the dE points in the negative x direction, contributing a negative dEx. For the charge at (r, π), if it were present (but it's not in our case because the arc is only 2 radians), the dEx would point positive.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the angles. Let me clarify the setup.

The arc is a portion of a circle with radius r=2.0 m. The central angle is θ=2 radians, so the arc spans from angle -1 rad to +1 rad in the circle.

Each small charge dq is located at a point on the circumference, at an angle φ from the x-axis. The electric field dE produced by this dq at the center will point directly away from dq. So the direction of dE is along the line connecting dq to the center, but pointing away from dq. So if dq is at angle φ, then the direction of dE is along the vector pointing from dq to the center, which is the same as pointing towards the origin from dq.

Wait no, wait. If the charge is positive, the field it creates at the center points away from the charge. So if dq is at (r cos φ, r sin φ), then the electric field vector at the origin is in the direction from (r cos φ, r sin φ) to (0,0), which is (-r cos φ, -r sin φ). But the electric field vector points away from the positive charge, so the vector would be in the direction from dq towards the origin? Or away from dq?

Wait, no. The electric field at a point due to a positive charge points away from the charge. So if dq is at (x,y), then the electric field at the origin is a vector pointing from (x,y) towards the origin? No, wait no. That's not correct. The electric field vector at the origin due to a charge at (x,y) is pointing away from (x,y). So if (x,y) is in the first quadrant (x>0, y>0), the electric field at the origin would be pointing towards the origin only if the charge were negative. For a positive charge, the field points away, so from (x,y) to the origin for negative charge, and away for positive.

Wait, no, no. Let me get this right. For a positive charge, the electric field at any point is in the direction a positive test charge would feel a force. So if the charge is at (x,y), then at the origin, the electric field due to this positive charge would point away from (x,y). So the vector would point from (x,y) towards the origin only if the charge is negative. For a positive charge, it would point away from (x,y), which is towards increasing x and y if (x,y) is in the first quadrant.

Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, if the charge is at (x,y), then the electric field at the origin is a vector pointing away from (x,y). So if (x,y) is (r, 0), then the electric field at the origin points in the negative x direction, because it's away from (r,0). So that's correct.

So each dq contributes a dE vector that points from dq towards the center if the charge is positive? No, wait, no. Wait, the electric field vector at the origin due to dq at (x,y) points away from dq if dq is positive. So if dq is at (r,0), the field points in the negative x direction. If dq is at (0,r), the field points in the negative y direction. Similarly, for other angles.

So each dq contributes a field at the origin that points directly opposite to where dq is located. So the direction of dE is from the origin towards the opposite side of where dq is.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let's model this with coordinates. Suppose dq is at (r,0). The electric field at the origin (0,0) due to this dq is a vector pointing away from (r,0), which is directly towards (0,0) along the negative x-axis. So the vector is (-dE, 0).

If dq is at (0,r), the field at the origin points in the negative y direction, so (0, -dE).

Similarly, if dq is at (r cos φ, r sin φ), then the field at origin points in the direction (-cos φ, -sin φ).

So the electric field from each dq is in the direction opposite to the position vector of dq. So each dE vector has components ( - (dq/(4πε₀ r²)) cos φ , - (dq/(4πε₀ r²)) sin φ ) .

So when we sum all the contributions from each dq around the arc from φ = -θ/2 to φ = θ/2, the y-components will cancel out because for every φ, there's a -φ, and their sine terms are negatives. The x-components, however, will add up because cos(-φ) = cos φ.

So the total electric field will only have an x-component. Let's compute that.

First, express dq in terms of λ and ds. Since the charge is uniformly distributed along the arc length, dq = λ ds, where ds is the differential arc length. For a circle of radius r, ds = r dφ.

So dq = λ r dφ.

The magnitude of each dE is (1/(4πε₀)) * (dq) / r². Substituting dq, we have dE = (1/(4πε₀)) * (λ r dφ) / r² = (λ dφ) / (4πε₀ r).

The x-component of each dE is -dE cos φ, because the electric field points opposite to the position of dq, as we discussed. So dEx = - (λ dφ)/(4πε₀ r) * cos φ.

Wait, no. Wait, the electric field vector's x-component is (-dE cos φ). Because the field points opposite to the dq's position, so each dE_x is - (dE) cos φ.

But wait, let me make sure. The field vector from dq at angle φ is pointing in the direction opposite to φ, so its components are (-dE cos φ, -dE sin φ). So the x-component is -dE cos φ, y-component is -dE sin φ.

Wait no, that's not correct. Because the direction of the field is from dq towards the center, but the field vector's components would be in the direction towards the center. So for a dq at (r cos φ, r sin φ), the field points towards the origin, so the components would be (-r cos φ, -r sin φ) direction, scaled by 1/(4πε₀ r²) * dq.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach is better. Let's model the dq as being at angle φ, and compute the field at the center due to this dq.

The electric field vector at the center due to dq is dE = (k * dq / r²) * (-r̂), where r̂ is the unit vector pointing from the origin to dq. Since the field points away from dq (because it's positive), but since we're considering the field at the center, which is in the direction towards the origin from dq, the unit vector is -r̂. So dE = (k dq / r²) (-r̂).

Expressed in Cartesian components, r̂ is (cos φ, sin φ), so dE is ( - (k dq / r²) cos φ, - (k dq / r²) sin φ ). 

But wait, no. Because the field points away from the charge, so if the charge is at position (r cos φ, r sin φ), then the field at the origin is in the direction away from that point, which is towards the origin. So the unit vector is (-cos φ, -sin φ), so dE = (k dq / r²) * (-cos φ, -sin φ).

Wait, but that would mean dE points towards the center, which is correct for a positive charge. So yes, the components are as such.

Now, the x-component is dE_x = - (k dq / r²) cos φ, and the y-component is dE_y = - (k dq / r²) sin φ.

But when we integrate over the symmetric arc from φ = -θ/2 to φ = θ/2, the y-components cancel out, because for each φ, there's a -φ that gives equal and opposite y-components. So the total E_y is zero.

The x-components, however, add up because cos(-φ) = cos φ, so each pair contributes twice the x-component from 0 to θ/2.

So the total electric field is only along the x-axis. Let's compute E_x.

E_x = integral (dE_x) from φ = -θ/2 to θ/2.

Which is E_x = integral [ - (k dq / r²) cos φ ] dφ from -θ/2 to θ/2.

But dq = λ r dφ, so substituting:

E_x = integral [ - (k (λ r dφ) / r²) cos φ ] from -θ/2 to θ/2.

Simplify:

E_x = integral [ - (k λ dφ / r) cos φ ] from -θ/2 to θ/2.

The integral of cos φ dφ is sin φ. So evaluating from -θ/2 to θ/2:

E_x = - (k λ / r) [ sin(θ/2) - sin(-θ/2) ].

But sin(-θ/2) = - sin(θ/2), so:

E_x = - (k λ / r) [ sin(θ/2) + sin(θ/2) ) ] = - (k λ / r) ( 2 sin(θ/2) )

So E_x = - 2 k λ sin(θ/2) / r.

But wait, the negative sign indicates the direction. Since all the x-components are pointing in the negative x direction (as each dq contributes a dE_x that's negative), the total E_x
