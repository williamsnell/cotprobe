Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about sound waves moving from one medium to another. Hmm, the question is about what doesn't change when sound enters a denser medium. Let me think about what I remember from my classes.

So, the sound is emitted in the first medium and then moves into a denser medium. I remember that when sound travels from one medium to another, some properties change and others stay the same. Let's go through each option.

The question says "all of the following changes EXCEPT." So I need to find which one remains the same.

First, the options are A to J. Let me list what each option refers to.

Option A: tone. Tone is related to the quality of the sound, like the difference between a guitar and a violin playing the same note. But I think tone depends on the waveform, such as harmonics. Wait, but when the medium changes, does that affect the tone? Maybe, because the medium could alter how the sound propagates, perhaps causing some frequencies to be absorbed more, which would change the tone. I'm not too sure about this one.

Option B: amplitude. Amplitude is the maximum displacement of the wave, which determines the loudness. When entering a denser medium, I think some of the sound reflects and some refracts. The amplitude might change because part of the wave is reflected, so the transmitted wave could have less amplitude. So amplitude probably changes.

Option C: wavelength. I recall that when sound moves into a denser medium, its speed changes. The frequency stays the same, but since velocity v = f * lambda, if velocity changes, wavelength must change. Because if f is the same and v increases (or decreases), lambda would change. Wait, wait, does velocity increase or decrease when entering a denser medium? Oh right, denser materials have higher speed for sound. For example, sound travels faster in water than in air. So when it enters a denser medium, the velocity increases. Since frequency is the same, wavelength would increase because lambda = v/f. So wavelength changesâ€”so option C is something that does change, meaning it's not the exception.

Option D: direction. Oh, right, when a wave changes medium, it can bend, which is refraction. So the direction of the sound wave would change. So direction does change, meaning D is not the exception.

Option E: pitch. Pitch is related to frequency. So if frequency doesn't change, pitch remains the same. But wait, let me think again. If something about the medium changes, does it affect how we perceive pitch? No, because pitch is determined by frequency, which doesn't change when moving between media. So E is a candidate for something that doesn't change.

Option F: frequency. I remember that frequency is determined by the source and doesn't change with the medium. So when sound moves from one medium to another, the frequency remains the same. Because the source is vibrating at a certain rate, and that's what generates the wave. So F doesn't change, making it a possible exception. But wait, the question is about which one does not change. So the exception is the one that doesn't change, so the correct answer is the one that doesn't change. So if the question is asking which one doesn't change, then F (frequency) is the exception.

Wait, but I need to make sure. Because when a sound wave enters a new medium, like from air to water, the frequency doesn't change because the source's vibration determines it. The speed and wavelength change, but not the frequency. So F is correct because it's the one that doesn't change.

But the question is phrased: all of the following changes except? So which one does not change? So the correct answer is F: frequency.

Looking back at the options, the question is about what doesn't change. So all others change except F.

Wait, but let me go through the other options just to make sure.

Option G: resonance. Resonance depends on the medium's properties, like the length of a pipe or the size of an object. If the medium changes, resonance would change because the conditions for resonance are different. So G changes.

Option H: volume. Volume is another term for loudness, which is related to amplitude. If amplitude changes, then volume changes. So H changes.

Option I: intensity. Intensity depends on the amplitude and the medium's properties. When entering a denser medium, some of the sound is reflected, and the transmitted intensity is less. So I changes.

Option J: velocity. Velocity definitely changes because denser mediums have different speeds for sound. So J changes.

So all options change except F: frequency. So the answer is F.

When sound travels from one medium to another, certain properties change while others remain constant. The question asks which property does **not** change when sound enters a denser medium. Here's the analysis of each option:

- **A: Tone**  
  Tone is related to the quality of sound, which can change due to differences in how the medium affects the waveform or harmonics. Therefore, tone changes.

- **B: Amplitude**  
  Amplitude, which determines loudness, changes because some of the sound is reflected at the boundary between the two media, reducing the amplitude of the transmitted wave.

- **C: Wavelength**  
  Wavelength changes because the velocity of sound depends on the medium. As sound enters a denser medium, its velocity increases, and since frequency remains constant, wavelength also changes.

- **D: Direction**  
  Direction changes due to refraction, which occurs when sound bends as it moves from one medium to another.

- **E: Pitch**  
  Pitch is perceived based on frequency. Since frequency remains constant, pitch does not change.

- **F: Frequency**  
  Frequency is determined by the source and does not depend on the medium. Therefore, frequency remains constant when sound enters a denser medium.

- **G: Resonance**  
  Resonance depends on the properties of the medium, such as the size and shape of objects. When the medium changes, resonance conditions change.

- **H: Volume**  
  Volume, or loudness, is related to amplitude. Since amplitude changes, volume also changes.

- **I: Intensity**  
  Intensity depends on amplitude and the medium's properties. As amplitude changes and some sound is reflected, intensity changes.

- **J: Velocity**  
  Velocity changes because sound travels at different speeds in different media. In a denser medium, the speed of sound increases.

The only property that does not change is **frequency**. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**F**
