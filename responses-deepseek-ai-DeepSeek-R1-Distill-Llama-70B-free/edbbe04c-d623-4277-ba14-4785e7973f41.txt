Question:

Alfred and Ben don't know each other but are each considering asking the lovely Charlene to the school prom. The probability that at least one of them will ask her is 0.72. The probability that they both ask her is 0.18. The probability that Alfred asks her is 0.6. What is the probability that Ben asks Charlene to the prom?

Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

So, Alfred and Ben are both thinking about asking Charlene to the prom. They don't know each other, so their decisions are probably independent, but I'm not sure yet. The problem gives me some probabilities and asks for the probability that Ben asks her.

The given data:
- The probability that at least one of them asks her is 0.72. Hmm, that's P(A or B) = 0.72.
- The probability that both ask her is 0.18. So, P(A and B) = 0.18.
- The probability that Alfred asks her is 0.6. So, P(A) = 0.6.

And I need to find P(B), which is the probability that Ben asks her.

I remember that for two events, the formula for the probability of their union is P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Oh right, because if you just add them, you're double-counting the overlap where both happen.

So plugging in the numbers I have:

0.72 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.18

Let me compute that. Let's see:

0.72 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.18

Wait, 0.6 minus 0.18 is 0.42. So,

0.72 = 0.42 + P(B)

Then, subtract 0.42 from both sides:

0.72 - 0.42 = P(B)

0.3 = P(B)

So Ben's probability is 0.3.

Looking at the options, option H is 0.3. So the answer should be H.

To determine the probability that Ben asks Charlene to the prom, we use the formula for the probability of the union of two events:

\[
P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \text{ and } B)
\]

Given:
- \( P(A \text{ or } B) = 0.72 \)
- \( P(A \text{ and } B) = 0.18 \)
- \( P(A) = 0.6 \)

Substitute the known values into the formula:

\[
0.72 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.18
\]

Simplify:

\[
0.72 = 0.42 + P(B)
\]

Solve for \( P(B) \):

\[
P(B) = 0.72 - 0.42 = 0.3
\]

Thus, the probability that Ben asks Charlene to the prom is 0.3. The correct answer is **H**.
