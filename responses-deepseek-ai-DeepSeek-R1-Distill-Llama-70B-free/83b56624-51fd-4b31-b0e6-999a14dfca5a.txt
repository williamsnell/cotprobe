Okay, so I've got this question about meiosis, and I'm supposed to figure out which statement isn't true. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my biology, but let me think this through step by step.

The question is asking which option is NOT true about meiosis. The options are A through D. Let me go through each one and see what I remember.

Option A says, "Meiosis produces two haploid gametes." Wait, I thought meiosis results in four gametes, not two. Oh, right! Because each meiotic division splits the cell, so it goes from diploid to haploid over two divisions. So each meiosis process makes four haploid cells, but I guess sometimes they might refer to each cell as a gamete. Or wait, maybe in some contexts, like in humans, each primary gamete becomes four, but each is a single gamete. Hmm, not sure. Maybe I'll come back to that.

Option B: "Homologous chromosomes join during synapsis." Synapsis is when homologous chromosomes pair up, right? That happens during prophase I of meiosis. So yeah, B sounds true.

Option C: "Sister chromatids separate during meiosis I." I remember that in meiosis I, the homologous chromosomes are separated. But sister chromatids are still together at that point. They don't separate until meiosis II, specifically in anaphase II. So wait, if C says sister chromatids separate in meiosis I, that's not correct. That would make option C the false statement. But let me double-check the other options to be sure.

Option D: "Crossing-over increases genetic variation in gametes." Crossing over during prophase I is when homologous chromosomes exchange segments, leading to genetic variation. So yes, D is definitely true.

So going back to option A: Wait, does meiosis produce two haploid gametes or four? Oh, wait, each meiosis process (in humans, for example) produces four haploid gametes, but they might be referring to each gamete as a separate cell. Or perhaps A is incorrect because it says two. Because, wait, I think a single meiosis results in four cells, but each is a gamete. Or maybe A is saying two per cell? No, I think each meiosis produces four haploid cells. So if A says two, that's wrong. Or wait, maybe I'm confusing with mitosis?

Wait, no. Mitosis produces two diploid cells. Meiosis I splits into two haploid cells, each with two chromatids. Then meiosis II splits each into two, so four in total. So each meiosis produces four haploid cells. So if option A says two, that would be incorrect. But wait, option A says "two haploid gametes." So if it's two, that's wrong because it's four. Or wait, maybe in some cases, like in males, each primary cell becomes four sperm, but each is a gamete. So A is incorrect because it says two, but in reality, it's four. But then what about option C?

Wait, option C says sister chromatids separate during meiosis I. No, that's not right. Sister chromatids separate in meiosis II. So C is false. So the incorrect statement is C.

So the question is to find which is NOT true. So the false statement is either A or C.

Wait, which one is correct. Let me clarify:

Meiosis I: Homologous chromosomes separate, each consisting of two sister chromatids. So sister chromatids are still together after meiosis I.

Meiosis II: Sister chromatids separate, so each becomes individual chromosomes.

So option C says sister chromatids separate during meiosis I. That's incorrect because that happens in meiosis II. So C is the false statement.

So the answer is option C.

Wait, but what about option A? Does meiosis produce two gametes? Or four? Because I thought each meiosis makes four gametes. So if A says two, that's wrong. But I might be mixing it up. Wait, no, each initial cell goes through meiosis to produce four gametes. But the question is about the process. So, perhaps the wording is tricky. Let me read the question again.

The question is, which is NOT true.

So if option A says meiosis produces two haploid gametes, that's incorrect because it's four. So option A is false. But wait, I thought each gamete is the result of one meiosis. No, each meiosis (in humans) results in four gametes. So A is wrong.

Wait, but I'm getting myself confused. Let me think again. Each meiosis process (one cell) produces four daughter cells. So each meiosis leads to four gametes. So if option A says "two haploid gametes," that's incorrect. But wait, maybe in certain organisms it's different. Or perhaps the option is phrased as "two" when it's actually four.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me see:

Option A: Meiosis produces two haploid gametes. That's incorrect because it's four. So A is false.

Option C: Sister chromatids separate during meiosis I. Also false because that happens in II.

Wait, but the question is which is NOT true, so there's only one correct answer. So which of these is the incorrect statement.

Hmm, perhaps I should recall what each option says.

The question is which is NOT true.

So if option A is wrong, but option C is also wrong, then I'm missing something. But I don't think both can be correct. Because the question provides four options, only one is correct as the false statement.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in what each option says.

Looking again:

Option A: Meiosis produces two haploid gametes.

Option C: Sister chromatids separate during meiosis I.

So which is false.

I believe that sister chromatids separate in meiosis II, so C is false. And meiosis produces four gametes, so A is also false. But that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the issue is about the number of gametes per meiosis. Wait, in males, each meiosis results in four gametes (sperm), but in females, it's one egg and three polar bodies. So perhaps the general statement is that meiosis produces four haploid gametes, but depending on the organism.

But the question is a general statement about meiosis. So if the option says it produces two, that's incorrect.

Wait, but another possibility: maybe the option is referring to the fact that each meiotic division (I and II) produces two cells each. So meiosis I splits into two, and II into four. So perhaps the statement in A is incorrect because it's four, not two.

So, if I have to choose between A and C as the incorrect statements, which one is the right answer.

Wait, the question is about which statement is NOT true. So which statement is false.

Meiosis I: homologous separate, sister chromatids stay together.

Meiosis II: sister chromatids separate.

So option C is false because it says sister chromatids separate during meiosis I.

Option A: if it's meiosis produces two haploid gametes, that's wrong because it's four. So option A is also false.

Wait, but perhaps the way the question is phrased: for example, when it says 'produces two haploid gametes,' maybe it's considering each division.

Wait, no. Meiosis as a whole produces four haploid cells. So if the option says two, that's incorrect.

So that would make both A and C incorrect, which can't be the case because it's a multiple-choice with a single correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding option A. Option A says "Meiosis produces two haploid gametes." That's incorrect because meiosis produces four. So option A is false.

But I thought the primary issue was with option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the result of each meiotic division. No, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps the answer is A. But I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think about each option again.

Option A: Meiosis produces two haploid gametes.

No, because meiosis leads to four haploid gametes. So A is false.

Option C: Sister chromatids separate during meiosis I.

No, that's false because separation occurs in II.

So both A and C are incorrect statements. But the question is asking for which is NOT true. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options.

Wait, perhaps option A is correct in a way. For example, in some contexts, each gamete is haploid, so perhaps four gametes are produced, but each is a single cell. So option A says two, which is wrong. So A is incorrect.

Hmm, but the question is which is NOT true. So the correct answer would be option C and option A, but that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about option A. Let me think again: the product of meiosis is four haploid cells. So option A is false because it says two. So the statement in option A is incorrect.

But wait, maybe the question is referring to the number of gametes per parent cell. For example, human males produce four sperm per meiosis, but perhaps the option is incorrect in stating two. Similarly, perhaps some organisms produce two, but generally, it's four.

Wait, but the general statement applies. So option A is incorrect.

But I'm getting stuck between options A and C.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the correct answers for each.

Wait, I can't do that, but I can reason through.

Another approach: process of elimination.

Option D is correct because crossing over does increase variation.

Option B is correct because synapsis is when homologous pair.

So the false statements are either A or C.

So the question is which is NOT true about meiosis.

So if I have to choose between A and C.

Which is the right answer.

Well, in meiosis I, the sister chromatids are still attached. They don't separate until meiosis II. So option C is false.

Option A: meiosis produces two haploid gametes. That is incorrect because meiosis produces four. So A is also false.

But the question is which statement is NOT true, so only one option is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing the correct understanding of option A. Maybe in some contexts, each meiosis produces two gametes, but I think that's not the case. For humans, it's four. So perhaps option A is incorrect, making it the false statement.

Wait, but the question is which is NOT true. So the incorrect statement is the one that's false.

Wait, if the correct statements are B, C, D, and A is incorrect.

No, wait, C is incorrect. So perhaps the answer is C.

Wait, perhaps the real answer is option C.

So the answer is option C.
</think>

To determine which statement about meiosis is NOT true, let's analyze each option:

**Option A:** "Meiosis produces two haploid gametes."  
This is incorrect because meiosis produces four haploid gametes, not two. While it is true that each meiotic division splits the cell, the overall result of meiosis is four haploid cells. Therefore, this statement is false.

**Option B:** "Homologous chromosomes join during synapsis."  
This is true. During prophase I of meiosis, homologous chromosomes pair up in a process called synapsis, forming a structure called a tetrad. This statement is correct.

**Option C:** "Sister chromatids separate during meiosis I."  
This is incorrect. Sister chromatids remain attached during meiosis I and separate during meiosis II. This statement is false.

**Option D:** "Crossing-over increases genetic variation in gametes."  
This is true. Crossing-over during prophase I introduces genetic variation by exchanging segments between homologous chromosomes. This statement is correct.

Now, to resolve the conflict between options A and C:  
- Option A is false because meiosis produces four haploid gametes, not two.  
- Option C is also false because sister chromatids separate during meiosis II, not meiosis I.  

However, the question asks for the single statement that is NOT true. Since both A and C are false, the more directly incorrect statement is **C**, as it misrepresents a fundamental aspect of meiosis (the timing of sister chromatid separation).  

Thus, the correct answer is **C**.  

**Answer: C**
