Question:

Two co-defendants were investment brokers at a bank. They had been employed by the bank for ten years. One day, they were unexpectedly fired by the bank's new manager. Apparently, the co-defendants' investments had not been performing well in the economic downturn. The co-defendants, upset and humiliated by their firing, vowed to get back at the bank. As their revenge, they decided to plant a bomb in the bank and demand $2,000,000. After receiving the money, they would then reveal the location of the bomb and provide details for defusing it. The co-defendants agreed that the bank should be given adequate warning so that nobody would be injured. In accordance with their plan, the co-defendants consulted the Internet, where they found all the information they needed on how to build a bomb. They built the bomb and placed it in a supply closet. Shortly thereafter, they phoned the bank and made a demand for the money. They said a bomb was in the bank and that it would explode in 24 hours unless the money was paid. The bank refused to pay the money. Realizing that their plan had gone awry, they drove to the bank to attempt to defuse the bomb. As they were driving back to the bank, the bomb exploded, killing 30 people. If the co-defendants are charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder, which of the following statements is correct?

Options:

A: Only the co-defendant who made the phone call is guilty of murder, but both are guilty of conspiracy to commit murder.
B: Both co-defendants are guilty of murder and conspiracy to commit murder.
C: Both co-defendants are guilty of conspiracy to commit murder, but not murder.
D: Both co-defendants are not guilty of murder and conspiracy to commit murder.
E: Both co-defendants are guilty of felony murder, but neither is guilty of conspiracy to commit murder.
F: Both co-defendants are guilty of felony murder, and only one is guilty of conspiracy to commit murder.
G: Only the co-defendant who placed the bomb is guilty of felony murder and conspiracy to commit murder.
H: Only the co-defendant who made the phone call is guilty of felony murder and conspiracy to commit murder.
I: Both co-defendants are guilty of conspiracy to commit murder, and only one is guilty of murder.
J: Only the co-defendant who placed the bomb is guilty of murder, but both are guilty of conspiracy to commit murder.

Okay, so I've got this law question here about two co-defendants who used to work at a bank. They were fired and decided to get revenge by planting a bomb and demanding money. The plan was to give the bank enough time to evacuate so no one gets hurt. But things went wrong—when they tried to defuse it after the bank refused to pay, the bomb exploded, killing 30 people. Now they're charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder. I need to figure out which option (A-J) is correct.

Alright, first, I should break down the elements here. Conspiracy and murder. Let's think about each charge.

Starting with conspiracy to commit murder. Conspiracy generally requires an agreement between two or more people to commit a crime, with the intent to achieve that goal. Here, both defendants agreed to plant the bomb and demand money. They built the bomb and placed it. So they clearly had a plan and acted on it together. So both are guilty of conspiracy to commit murder. So any option where they're not both guilty of conspiracy is probably wrong.

Now, onto murder. Murder usually requires malice aforethought—intent to kill, or knowledge that the act would result in such a high risk of death that it's akin to wanting it. But here, their plan was to give the bank 24 hours to respond, intending that people would evacuate. They didn't want anyone to die; they just wanted the money. But their bomb exploded before they could defuse it, killing people.

Wait, but in criminal law, sometimes even if you don't intend to kill, you can be guilty under different doctrines. Like the felony murder rule. Felony murder is when a death occurs during the commission of a felony, and the rule applies even if the death wasn't intended. The underlying felony here would be... well, what felony were they committing when the bomb exploded?

They were in the process of planting the bomb and making the demand. So the felony could be the planting of the bomb, which is a serious crime. Alternatively, maybe the conspiracy itself is a felony. But I'm not sure. Wait, conspiracy is an inchoate offense, not necessarily a felony for felony murder unless the target crime is a felony.

Wait, the act of placing the bomb is likely a specific intent crime, maybe like possession of an explosive device with intent to cause harm. So, when they planted the bomb, that's a felony. Then, when the bomb exploded, killing people, that would make them guilty of felony murder. Because the death happened during the commission of that felony.

But another thought—could their original plan have the necessary intent for murder? They didn't intend to kill anyone. They wanted to extort money. So, their intent was to threaten, but not to kill. So, they might lack the specific intent for first or second-degree murder. But under felony murder, intent to kill isn't required. So, regardless of their intent, if a death occurs during the felony, they can be convicted of murder.

So both of them would be guilty of felony murder because they were both part of the conspiracy and the act that led to the deaths.

But wait, I should also consider if the felony was a continuing one. They planted the bomb, which is the felony. Then, when they tried to defuse it, perhaps the felony was still ongoing. So the bomb explosion happened during the commission of the felony, making both liable for felony murder.

So both would be guilty of murder under the felony murder doctrine and conspiracy to commit murder.

Looking back at the options:

Option B: Both guilty of murder and conspiracy.

Option E: Both guilty of felony murder, but neither guilty of conspiracy. But that's wrong because they did conspire.

Option F: Both guilty of felony murder, only one guilty of conspiracy. No, both conspired.

Option B says both guilty of both charges. So that's possible. But wait, I thought the conspiracy was to commit murder, but during the commission, the actual deaths were under felony murder. So the conspiracy charge would be for planning the murder, but the actual murder charge would be felony murder. So do they both get convicted of conspiracy to commit murder and murder (as felony murder)?

Wait, but the initial plan was to plant the bomb and give a warning. Their intention was to extort money, not to kill. So the conspiracy was to commit an act that would cause fear, but not necessarily to kill. So perhaps the conspiracy charge is for a different crime, like extortion, but the question says they're charged with conspiracy to commit murder. So maybe the prosecutor is arguing that their actions showed an intent to kill.

Alternatively, perhaps the conspiracy was to commit the act of planting the bomb, which could be considered an act that a reasonable person would know could result in death. So perhaps they're guilty of conspiracy to commit murder because their plan involved an act likely to cause death.

But wait, in common law, conspiracy to commit murder requires the specific intent to kill. If the co-defendants only intended to threaten and not actually kill, then maybe the conspiracy charge isn't valid. But this is a tricky point.

Wait, but if the co-defendants' act of planting a bomb would foreseeably result in death if the bomb explodes, and they intended the bomb to explode (if the money wasn't paid), then perhaps they had the intent that the bomb would explode, which would cause death. So their plan was: if the money isn't paid, the bomb explodes, killing people. So in that case, their intent was that if the demand wasn't met, the bomb would kill. Therefore, they intended murder as part of their plan. So they conspired to commit murder because they agreed that if the money wasn't paid, the bomb would explode, killing people.

So yes, they had the intent for murder in that scenario. So both would be guilty of conspiracy to commit murder and, when the bomb exploded, guilty of murder under felony murder.

So looking at the options again, option B says both are guilty of murder and conspiracy.

But wait, let me think about the felony murder aspect. Felony murder doesn't require intent to kill; it's based on the underlying felony. So in this case, the underlying felony could be planting the bomb, which is a serious crime. So their act of placing the bomb (a felony) led to the death, making them guilty of felony murder. So both are guilty of murder (as felony murder) and conspiracy to commit murder.

So option B would be correct: both guilty of murder and conspiracy.

Wait, but let me check the other options to make sure.

Option E: Both guilty of felony murder, but neither guilty of conspiracy. That's not right because they did conspire.

Option B is correct.

The two co-defendants, former investment brokers, were fired and sought revenge by planting a bomb in the bank and demanding $2,000,000. Their plan included giving the bank 24 hours to respond, intending to allow evacuation and avoid harm. However, the bomb exploded before they could defuse it, killing 30 people. They are now charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder.

### Analysis of Conspiracy to Commit Murder:
Conspiracy requires an agreement between two or more individuals to commit a crime, with the intent to achieve that goal. Here, the co-defendants agreed to plant the bomb and demand money. Their actions demonstrate a clear plan and intent to carry out the crime. Although their primary goal was extortion, the act of planting the bomb (a foreseeable act that could result in death) shows that they intended for the bomb to explode if the demand was not met. This intent to cause death satisfies the requirements for conspiracy to commit murder. Therefore, both co-defendants are guilty of conspiracy to commit murder.

### Analysis of Murder:
Murder typically requires malice aforethought, which can include intent to kill or knowledge that the act would result in a high risk of death. While the co-defendants did not explicitly intend to kill, they planted a bomb with the knowledge that it could explode and cause death if the demand was not met. Under the felony murder doctrine, a death occurring during the commission of a felony (such as planting a bomb) makes the defendants guilty of murder, regardless of whether they specifically intended to kill. The explosion of the bomb during the commission of the felony (planting and threatening to detonate it) makes both co-defendants guilty of felony murder.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. Both co-defendants are guilty of murder, as the felony murder doctrine applies to both.
- **Option B**: Correct. Both co-defendants are guilty of murder (under felony murder) and conspiracy to commit murder.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Both co-defendants are guilty of murder under the felony murder doctrine.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Both co-defendants are guilty of murder and conspiracy to commit murder.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. Both co-defendants are guilty of conspiracy to commit murder.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Both co-defendants are guilty of conspiracy to commit murder.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Both co-defendants are guilty of murder and conspiracy to commit murder.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. Both co-defendants are guilty of murder and conspiracy to commit murder.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. Both co-defendants are guilty of murder under the felony murder doctrine.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. Both co-defendants are guilty of murder and conspiracy to commit murder.

### Conclusion:
Both co-defendants are guilty of murder (under the felony murder doctrine) and conspiracy to commit murder. The correct answer is:

**B**
