Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about relative motion between two inertial frames. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says there are two systems, S and S'. They share a common x-axis and their y-axes are parallel. S' is moving at 0.6c relative to S along the x-axis. So from S's perspective, S' is moving at 0.6c in the positive x-direction. Right?

Now, an observer in S sees a rocket moving at 0.1c in the positive y-direction. Wait, so in S's frame, the rocket's velocity is entirely along y. No x-component, correct? So in S, the rocket's velocity is (0, 0.1c, 0), assuming we're dealing with 2D here.

But the question is asking what the rocket's velocity looks like in S'. So I think I need to apply the velocity addition formulas from special relativity here, because the speeds are a significant fraction of c.

Wait, right, the classical velocity addition would just add the x-components, but in relativity, velocities don't simply add up like that. The formulas are a bit different.

So the relativistic velocity addition equations. Let me recall them. The velocity in S' (u') is related to the velocity in S (u) by considering the relative velocity v between the frames. The formulas are:

u'_x = (u_x - v) / (1 - (u_x * v)/(c²))
u'_y = (u_y * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) / (1 - (u_x * v)/c²))
u'_z = same as u_z, but in this case, since all motion is in x and y, z is zero.

Wait wait, but in this problem, in S, the rocket has u_x = 0 because it's moving along y. So u_x is zero. That should simplify things.

So plugging u_x = 0 into the equations.

u'_x = (0 - v) / (1 - (0 * v)/c²) ) = (-v) / 1 = -v. So u'_x is -v. But v is the speed of S' relative to S, which is 0.6c. So u'_x = -0.6c.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no. Wait, the velocity of S' relative to S is v=0.6c in the x-direction. So from S' frame, does that mean the rocket's x-component is negative 0.6c? Because S' is moving at 0.6c relative to S. So for an object at rest in S (u=0), in S' it's moving at -0.6c in x.

But in this case, the object (rocket) is not at rest. It's moving along y in S. So in S', it should have a y-component as well as an x-component.

So in S, u_x is zero, u_y is 0.1c.

Applying the equations:

u'_x = (0 - 0.6c) / (1 - (0 * 0.6c)/c²) ) → numerator is -0.6c, denominator is 1. So u'_x = -0.6c.

u'_y = (u_y * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) / (1 - (u_x * v)/c²) )

Plugging in the numbers:

u_y is 0.1c, v is 0.6c.

So sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.36) = sqrt(0.64) = 0.8.

Denominator is 1 - (0 * 0.6c)/c² → 1.

So u'_y = (0.1c * 0.8) / 1 = 0.08c.

So in S', the rocket's velocity is u'_x = -0.6c, u'_y = 0.08c.

Wait, but that doesn't match any of the options directly. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option B says 0.605c at 7°36' with the negative x-axis.

Hmm, let me compute the magnitude and direction.

The components are u'_x = -0.6c, u'_y = 0.08c.

So the speed magnitude is sqrt( (0.6c)^2 + (0.08c)^2 ) = c * sqrt(0.36 + 0.0064) = c * sqrt(0.3664) ≈ c * 0.605.

So approximately 0.605c.

The direction is the angle theta from the negative x-axis. Because u'_x is negative and u'_y is positive, the rocket is moving in the second quadrant, but the angle is measured from the negative x-axis towards the positive y-axis.

So tan(theta) = (u'_y) / (|u'_x|) = 0.08c / 0.6c = 0.1333...

What's the arctangent of 0.1333? Let me think. I know that tan(7.5 degrees) is about 0.1325, which is very close to 0.1333. So approximately 7.5 degrees, which is 7 degrees and about 30 minutes (since 0.5 degrees is 30 minutes). So maybe 7°30', but the option says 7°36', which I'm not sure. Wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation is better.

tan(theta) = 0.08 / 0.6 = 0.133333...

So theta = arctan(0.133333) in degrees.

Using a calculator, arctan(0.133333) is approximately 7.594 degrees, which is about 7 degrees and 35.6 minutes. So around 7 degrees 36 minutes. So that would match option B.

Wait, but option B says 0.605c at 7°36' with the negative x-axis. So that seems to fit.

Looking at the options:

Option B: 0.605c in a direction making an angle of 7°36' with the negative direction of the x-axis.

Yes, that matches our calculation.

Wait, but let me double-check the velocity components. Did I apply the equations correctly?

In S, u_x = 0, u_y = 0.1c.

In S', u'_x = (0 - v)/(1 - (0*v)/c²) → -v → -0.6c.

u'_y = (u_y * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) / (1 - (0*v)/c²) → u_y * sqrt(0.64) → 0.1c * 0.8 = 0.08c.

Yes, that's correct.

So the speed in S' is sqrt( (0.6)^2 + (0.08)^2 ) c = sqrt(0.36 +0.0064)=sqrt(0.3664) c ≈ 0.605c.

So the speed is approximately 0.605c, and the angle is arctan(0.08/0.6) ≈7.594 degrees, which is about 7°36'.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, let me check other options. Option C says 0.7c and 8 degrees, but that would come from perhaps using classical velocity addition, but I don't think so. Let me check:

If someone were to add velocities classically, perhaps they'd think that the rocket's velocity is 0.6c (speed of S') plus 0.1c in y, but that doesn't make sense because x and y are perpendicular.

No, wait, classical addition wouldn't affect y, but the x-component would be -0.6c, and the y-component would remain 0.1c. Then the speed would be sqrt(0.6² + 0.1² )= sqrt(0.36 +0.01)=sqrt(0.37)=~0.608c, which is close to 0.605c, but the angle would be tan(0.1/0.6)=0.16666, which is about 9.46 degrees. But that's not matching any option except perhaps option F (10 degrees), but F's speed is 0.6c, which doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps someone might use (0.6c, 0.1c), but that would be wrong because in reality, the y-component is affected by the Lorentz factor.

In our problem, the y-component is 0.08c, not 0.1c, because of the gamma factor. So the speed ends up about 0.605c, with the angle about 7.5 degrees as we calculated.

So the correct option is B.

To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the rocket in the two inertial frames S and S'. The frames share a common x-axis, and S' moves at a velocity of \( v = 0.6c \) relative to S along the x-axis. In S, the rocket is observed to move with a velocity \( u_y = 0.1c \) in the positive y-direction, with no x-component (\( u_x = 0 \)).

Using the relativistic velocity addition formulas:

1. **For the x-component of velocity in S'**:
   \[
   u'_x = \frac{u_x - v}{1 - \frac{u_x v}{c^2}}
   \]
   Substituting \( u_x = 0 \) and \( v = 0.6c \):
   \[
   u'_x = \frac{0 - 0.6c}{1 - 0} = -0.6c
   \]

2. **For the y-component of velocity in S'**:
   \[
   u'_y = \frac{u_y \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}{1 - \frac{u_x v}{c^2}}
   \]
   Substituting \( u_y = 0.1c \), \( v = 0.6c \), and \( u_x = 0 \):
   \[
   u'_y = \frac{0.1c \sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}}{1 - 0} = 0.1c \sqrt{1 - 0.36} = 0.1c \cdot 0.8 = 0.08c
   \]

Thus, in S', the rocket has velocity components \( u'_x = -0.6c \) and \( u'_y = 0.08c \).

3. **Magnitude of the velocity in S'**:
   The speed is given by:
   \[
   \text{Speed} = \sqrt{(u'_x)^2 + (u'_y)^2} = \sqrt{(-0.6c)^2 + (0.08c)^2} = \sqrt{0.36c^2 + 0.0064c^2} = c \sqrt{0.3664} \approx 0.605c
   \]

4. **Direction of the velocity in S'**:
   The angle \( \theta \) of the velocity vector with respect to the negative x-axis is:
   \[
   \tan\theta = \frac{u'_y}{|u'_x|} = \frac{0.08c}{0.6c} = 0.1333
   \]
   Using a calculator, \( \theta \approx 7.594^\circ \), which is approximately \( 7^\circ 36' \).

From the above, the rocket's velocity in S' is approximately \( 0.605c \) at an angle of \( 7^\circ 36' \) with the negative x-axis. This matches **Option B**.

**Critical analysis of other options**:
- **Option A**: Incorrect, as the x-component is not \( 0.6c \) but \( -0.6c \), and the y-component is reduced to \( 0.08c \) due to relativistic effects.
- **Option C**: Incorrect, as the speed \( 0.7c \) is too high, and the angle \( 8^\circ \) does not match the calculated value.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as the speed \( 0.5c \) and angle \( 15^\circ \) are inconsistent with the calculations.
- **Option E**: Incorrect, as the rocket's velocity does change due to the relative motion of S'.
- **Option F**: Incorrect, as the speed \( 0.6c \) and angle \( 10^\circ \) do not match the calculations.
- **Option G**: Incorrect, as the speed \( 0.7c \) and angle \( 20^\circ \) are inconsistent with the calculations.
- **Option H**: Incorrect, as the speed \( 0.68c \) and angle \( 11^\circ \) do not match the calculations.
- **Option I**: Incorrect, as the speed \( 0.5c \) and angle \( 5^\circ \) are inconsistent with the calculations.
- **Option J**: Incorrect, as the rocket's velocity has both x and y components in S'.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**.
