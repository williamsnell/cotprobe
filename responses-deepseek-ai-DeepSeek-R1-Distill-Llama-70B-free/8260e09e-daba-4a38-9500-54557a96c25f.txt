Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. The question is about the challenges of comparing older adults' memory for recent events versus those that happened a long time ago. Specifically, it's asking about a problem related to recent events.

I remember from my psychology classes that there are different types of memory, like short-term and long-term, and how they change with age. As people get older, their ability to remember recent events might be affected differently than their ability to recall older memories. But wait, why is that a problem when comparing the two?

The question gives ten options, A through J. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Can be verified while older events often cannot. Hmm, that makes sense because recent events might still have evidence or people around to confirm, whereas older events might not. But is that the main issue when comparing? I'm not sure yet.

Option B: Are influenced by current mental state. I think our current mood or mental health can affect memory, but I'm not sure how this specifically relates to comparing recent versus distant memories in older adults.

Option C: May be very well rehearsed. Rehearsal usually strengthens memory. But recent events might not have been rehearsed as much as older ones, which have had more time to be thought about. Wait, but does that cause a problem in comparison? Maybe, but I'm not certain.

Option D: Are more likely to be distorted or embellished. I've heard that memories can change over time, but I thought that distortion might happen more with older memories because of more time passing. Or maybe recent events are clearer, so less distortion.

Option E: Are often less significant than older events. That could be possible. Older events might be more meaningful, so they're remembered better. But the question is about the problem of comparison, not which is remembered better.

Option F: Have a different emotional impact. Emotional impact does influence memory, but again, I'm not sure how that directly relates to the comparison issue.

Option G: Have no denominator to help in computing an average. I'm not sure what this means in this context. Maybe it's about statistics, but I don't recall this being a main issue in memory research.

Option H: Can be easily confused with older events. That sounds like it could be a problem. Maybe older adults mix up recent and past events because of similar contexts or something.

Option I: Are more likely to be forgotten. I know that older adults might have more trouble with short-term memory, so recent events could be harder to recall. But the question is about a problem in comparing the two types of memory.

Option J: Are far more meaningful. I'm not sure. It might depend on the individual, but I don't think this is the main issue.

Wait, the question is about a problem when comparing recent and remote memories. One issue I remember is that recent events are more susceptible to interference or forgetting, especially in older adults. But another point is that recent memories can be influenced by current circumstances, making them less reliable for comparison.

Looking back, option B says recent events are influenced by current mental state. That makes sense because if someone is depressed or anxious now, it could affect how they remember recent events, making it hard to compare accurately with older memories, which were formed under different conditions.

Alternatively, option A suggests that recent events can be verified. If that's the case, maybe it's easier to assess their accuracy, but the problem might be more about the factors affecting memory rather than verification.

Wait, another thought: when comparing, researchers might look at how well someone remembers recent versus distant events. A problem arises if recent events are more influenced by current factors, making the comparison less reliable.

So, between options A and B. Option A is about verifiability, which could be a problem because older events can't be verified as easily. But the question is about the problem in the comparison. If recent events can be verified, but older can't, that might make it harder to compare because you can't check the accuracy of older memories.

But wait, the question asks, "A problem... is that recent events..." So the problem is in recent events. So the issue is that recent events have some characteristic that makes comparison difficult.

If recent events can be verified (A), that might actually help in assessing their accuracy, so that's not a problem. The problem would be if they couldn't be verified, but the option says they can.

Option B says recent events are influenced by current mental state, which could affect their memory, making it harder to compare. So perhaps that's the issue.

Alternatively, option H suggests confusion between recent and older events. That could be a problem, but I'm not sure if that's the main point here.

I'm a bit torn between A and B. Let me think again. The question is about the problem that exists when comparing the two. If recent events can be verified, maybe that's not the problem. But if recent events are influenced by current mental state, that introduces variability that makes comparison difficult. So option B seems more fitting.

The question focuses on identifying a problem in comparing older adults' memory for recent events versus those that happened a long time ago. The key issue lies in the characteristics of recent events that make such comparisons challenging.

Option A suggests that recent events can be verified while older events often cannot. However, the ability to verify recent events does not inherently pose a problem; if anything, it could help assess accuracy. Therefore, this option does not align well with the question's focus on a problematic aspect of recent events.

Option B states that recent events are influenced by the current mental state. This is a significant issue because factors like mood, stress, or cognitive decline can affect how recent events are encoded and recalled, introducing variability that complicates comparisons with older memories.

Other options, such as C (rehearsal), D (distortion), E (significance), F (emotional impact), G (statistical denominator), H (confusion), I (forgetting), and J (meaningfulness), either address secondary concerns or do not directly relate to the specific problem of comparing recent and remote memories.

The most fitting answer is that recent events being influenced by the current mental state creates a challenge in accurately comparing them to older memories.
