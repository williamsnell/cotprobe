Okay, so I've got this question here about calculating the book value per share for ABC Corporation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that book value per share has something to do with equity. Oh right, because the book value of a company is basically the shareholders' equity, which is the total assets minus the total liabilities. So I should start by finding the shareholders' equity.

The question says total assets are $75,000 and total liabilities are $52,000. So let's subtract those: 75,000 minus 52,000. Let me do that math. 75 minus 52 is 23, so it should be $23,000. So the shareholders' equity is $23,000.

Now, the book value per share is calculated by taking that equity and dividing it by the number of shares outstanding. The company has 500 shares. So I divide 23,000 by 500.

Wait, how does that division work? Let's see, 23,000 divided by 500. Well, 500 goes into 23,000 how many times? 500 times 46 is 23,000 because 500 times 40 is 20,000, and 500 times 6 is 3,000. So 40+6=46. So 23,000 divided by 500 is $46 per share.

Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Another way to think about it: 500 shares times $46 should equal $23,000. 500 * 46 = (500*40)+(500*6) = 20,000 + 3,000 = 23,000. Yep, that checks out.

Looking at the options, option H is $46 per share. So the answer should be H.

The book value per share is calculated by dividing the shareholders' equity by the number of shares outstanding. Shareholders' equity is determined as total assets minus total liabilities: $75,000 - $52,000 = $23,000. Dividing this by the 500 shares gives $23,000 / 500 = $46 per share. 

The correct answer is H.
