Question:

Two single-user workstations are attached to the same local area network. On one of these workstations, file pages are accessed over the network from a file server; the average access time per page is 0.1 second. On the other of these workstations, file pages are accessed from a local disk; the average access time per page is 0.05 second. A particular compilation requires 30 seconds of computation and 200 file page accesses. What is the ratio of the total time required by this compilation if run on the diskless (file server) workstation to the total time required if run on the workstation with the local disk, if it is assumed that computation is not overlapped with file access?

Options:

A: 5/4
B: 10/5
C: 6/5
D: 5/3
E: 3/1
F: 4/3
G: 1/1
H: 7/4
I: 3/2
J: 2/1

Okay, so I've got this question here about comparing the total time for a compilation task on two different workstations. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the setup is that there are two workstations on the same local area network. One is diskless and gets its file pages from a file server, while the other has a local disk. The question is about the ratio of their total times for a particular compilation job.

So, the problem gives me some numbers. Let me jot them down:

- Compilation requires 30 seconds of computation.
- 200 file page accesses are needed.
- For the diskless workstation, each file page access takes 0.1 seconds on average.
- For the local disk workstation, each file page access is 0.05 seconds on average.

And the key point is that computation isn't overlapped with file access. So everything happens sequentially. That means the total time is just the sum of computation time and the time spent on file accesses.

Wait, so for each workstation, I need to calculate the total time. Then, find the ratio between the two.

Let me start with the diskless workstation (file server):

Time = Computation time + (Number of file accesses * Access time per file)
So that's 30 seconds + 200 * 0.1 seconds.

200 * 0.1 is 20 seconds. So total time is 30 + 20 = 50 seconds.

Now for the local disk workstation:

Time = 30 seconds + 200 * 0.05 seconds.

200 * 0.05 is 10 seconds. So total time is 30 +10 = 40 seconds.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, no, 0.05 per access times 200 is 10. So 30 plus 10 is 40. Yeah.

So the diskless takes 50 seconds, the local disk takes 40.

The question is the ratio of the diskless time to the local disk time. So 50 divided by 40.

50/40 simplifies to 5/4. Because 50 divided by 10 is 5, 40 divided by 10 is 4. So ratio is 5:4, which is 5/4.

Looking at the options: option A is 5/4. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me double-check in case I mixed up the ratio. The question says the ratio of the diskless (server) time to the local disk time, right?

Yes, the first part is the diskless case. So 50/40 is 5/4. So option A is correct.
</think>

To determine the ratio of the total time required for compilation on the diskless workstation (file server) to the time required on the workstation with a local disk, we calculate the total time for each scenario and then find their ratio.

### Diskless Workstation (File Server):
- **Computation time**: 30 seconds  
- **File access time**: \( 200 \times 0.1 = 20 \) seconds  
- **Total time**: \( 30 + 20 = 50 \) seconds  

### Local Disk Workstation:
- **Computation time**: 30 seconds  
- **File access time**: \( 200 \times 0.05 = 10 \) seconds  
- **Total time**: \( 30 + 10 = 40 \) seconds  

### Ratio:
The ratio of the total time for the diskless workstation to the local disk workstation is:  
\[
\frac{\text{Total time (diskless)}}{\text{Total time (local disk)}} = \frac{50}{40} = \frac{5}{4}
\]

Thus, the correct answer is **A: 5/4**.
