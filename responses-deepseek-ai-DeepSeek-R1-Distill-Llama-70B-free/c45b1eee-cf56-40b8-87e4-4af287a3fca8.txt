Okay, so I've got this question here about which state had the most Girl Scouts as of 1999. The options are A through J, each representing a different state. I'm not entirely sure about the exact numbers, but I'll try to think through this logically.

First, I know that Girl Scouts of the USA is a large organization with troops all over the country. The membership numbers probably vary by state based on population and other factors. So, states with larger populations might have more Girl Scouts, but it's not always a direct correlation because participation rates can vary.

Looking at the options: New York (A), Florida (B), Pennsylvania (C), North Carolina (D), Texas (E), Washington (F), California (G), Michigan (H), Ohio (I), Illinois (J). 

I think California has a really large population. As of 1999, it was the most populous state, so that might mean more Girl Scouts. Texas is also a big state, but I'm not sure if it had as many Girl Scouts as California. New York is another populous state, but I'm not certain if it's higher than California.

Wait, but sometimes the number of Girl Scouts might depend on the organization's presence and activities in the state. For example, some states might have more troops or more active participation. But without specific data, population size is a good indicator.

I remember hearing that Texas has a strong presence in various organizations, but I'm not sure about Girl Scouts specifically. California, being the most populous, probably had the highest number of Girl Scouts. Also, urban areas tend to have more organized groups, and California has major cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco.

Alternatively, maybe the question is a bit of a trick. Sometimes, states with higher participation rates in youth organizations might have more members even if their population isn't the highest. But again, without exact data, it's hard to say.

I think I'll go with California because it was the most populous state in 1999, and larger population usually means more members in organizations like the Girl Scouts.

As of 1999, California was the most populous state in the U.S., which suggests it likely had the highest number of Girl Scouts due to its large population and urban centers. While states like Texas and New York are also populous, California's size and prominence make it the most probable answer.
