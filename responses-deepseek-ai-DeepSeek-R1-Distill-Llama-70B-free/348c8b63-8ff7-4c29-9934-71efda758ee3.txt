Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a particle moving along a cardioid with constant speed. The question is asking for the radial component of the acceleration, which is the dot product of the acceleration vector with the unit radial vector. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that in polar coordinates, the position vector r is a function of theta. The given equation is r = k(1 + cosθ), which I recognize as a cardioid because it has that 1 + cosθ form. So the particle is moving along this curve with a constant speed v. Wait, speed is the magnitude of the velocity vector, right?

I think I need to find the acceleration in polar coordinates. Oh right, the acceleration vector in polar coordinates has two components: the radial (or centripetal) component and the tangential component. The formula for acceleration is:

a = (a_r) e_r + (a_θ) e_θ

Where a_r is the radial acceleration and a_θ is the tangential acceleration. But since the speed is constant, the tangential acceleration might be zero. Or wait, tangential acceleration is the derivative of the speed with respect to time. Since v is constant, a_θ should be zero. So the acceleration is entirely radial, which is the centripetal acceleration.

Wait, no, wait. The tangential acceleration a_θ is dv/dt, which is zero here because v is constant. So the only component is the radial part. But the radial component itself has two terms: one from the change in speed and another due to the change in the radius. Wait, the general formula for radial acceleration is:

a_r = r'' - r (θ')²

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me double-check the expressions. In polar coordinates, the acceleration components are:

a_r = d²r/dt² - r (dθ/dt)^2
a_θ = r d²θ/dt² + 2 (dr/dt)(dθ/dt)

But in this case, the speed v is given as constant. Hmm, speed v is the magnitude of the velocity, which in polar coordinates is sqrt( (dr/dt)^2 + r² (dθ/dt)^2 ). Since v is constant, its derivative is zero, so:

d/dt [ (dr/dt)^2 + r² (dθ/dt)^2 ) ] = 0

But I'm not sure if I need that right now. Let me focus on the acceleration components.

Since the speed is constant, the tangential acceleration a_θ is zero. So the acceleration is purely radial, meaning a = a_r e_r.

Wait no, wait. Because a_r is the component of acceleration in the radial direction, and a_θ is the component in the tangential direction. So if a_θ is zero, then the acceleration is entirely radial. So a · e_r is just a_r.

But I'm a bit shaky on this. Let me think again. The radial component of acceleration is a_r, and the tangential is a_θ. So if a_θ is zero, then the entire acceleration is a_r, so the dot product a · e_r is a_r.

But wait, I'm getting myself mixed up. Let me approach this step by step.

Given that the particle moves with constant speed v along the cardioid r =k(1 + cosθ), find the radial component of acceleration, which is a · e_r.

So first, I need to express the acceleration in terms of r and θ, and their time derivatives.

I think the key here is to express the acceleration components, plug in the given r(θ), and compute a · e_r.

Let me recall the acceleration components in polar coordinates:

a_r = d²r/dt² - r (dθ/dt)^2

a_θ = r d²θ/dt² + 2 (dr/dt)(dθ/dt)

But since v is constant, the speed is v = sqrt( (dr/dt)^2 + r² (dθ/dt)^2 )

And since v = const, the derivative of v with respect to time is zero. So:

dv/dt = 0 = [ (2 dr/dt)(d²r/dt²) + 2 r (dθ/dt)(d²θ/dt² + (dr/dt)(dθ/dt)^2) ) ] / (2v)

Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, since v is constant, the tangential acceleration a_θ is zero. Because a_θ is the rate of change of speed, which is zero. So a_θ = 0.

So from the expression for a_θ:

r d²θ/dt² + 2 (dr/dt)(dθ/dt) = 0.

That's an equation we can use.

Let me denote θ' as dθ/dt. So the equation becomes:

r (dθ'/dt) + 2 (dr/dt) θ' = 0.

But I'm not sure if that's immediately helpful. Let's think about the expressions for a_r.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express everything in terms of θ. Since r is given as a function of θ, perhaps we can parameterize the motion in terms of θ(t).

Let me try that.

Let me denote θ as a function of time t. Then, r = k(1 + cosθ(t)).

So, dr/dt = -k sinθ(t) * dθ/dt.

Let me denote dθ/dt as θ' (for simplicity).

Then, dr/dt = -k sinθ * θ'.

Similarly, d²r/dt² would be the derivative of dr/dt:

d²r/dt² = -k [ cosθ (θ')² * (-1) + sinθ * θ'' ].

Wait, let me compute that:

d²r/dt² = derivative of (-k sinθ * θ') with respect to t.

Which is:

- k [ cosθ (dθ/dt) * dθ/dt + sinθ * d²θ/dt² ]

= -k [ cosθ (θ')² + sinθ θ'' ]

So, now, the expression for a_r is:

a_r = d²r/dt² - r (θ')²

Substituting d²r/dt²:

a_r = [ -k ( cosθ (θ')² + sinθ θ'' ) ] - r (θ')²

But r is k(1 + cosθ), so substitute that:

a_r = [ -k cosθ (θ')² - k sinθ θ'' ] - k(1 + cosθ) (θ')²

Factor terms:

= -k cosθ (θ')² - k sinθ θ'' - k (1 + cosθ) (θ')²

= [ -k cosθ (θ')² - k (θ')² - k cosθ (θ')² ] - k sinθ θ''

Wait, wait, that's not right. Let's expand the terms correctly:

= -k cosθ (θ')² -k sinθ θ'' - k(1 + cosθ)(θ')²

Expanding the last term:

= -k cosθ (θ')² -k sinθ θ'' -k (θ')² -k cosθ (θ')²

Combine like terms:

= [ -k cosθ (θ')² -k cosθ (θ')² ] + [ -k sinθ θ'' ] + [ -k (θ')² ]

= (-2k cosθ (θ')² ) - k sinθ θ'' -k (θ')²

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider using the fact that a_θ = 0, because the speed is constant.

Earlier, I had the equation from a_θ = 0:

r (dθ''/dt²) + 2 (dr/dt)(dθ/dt) = 0.

We can write this as:

r θ'' + 2 (dr/dt) θ' = 0.

We know dr/dt = -k sinθ θ', so substituting:

r θ'' + 2 (-k sinθ θ') θ' = 0

=> r θ'' - 2k sinθ (θ')² = 0

We can solve for θ'':

θ'' = [ 2k sinθ (θ')² ] / r

But r = k(1 + cosθ), so:

θ'' = [ 2k sinθ (θ')² ] / [k(1 + cosθ) ]

Simplify:

θ'' = [ 2 sinθ (θ')² ] / (1 + cosθ )

Hmm, that might be useful. Let me substitute this back into the expression for a_r.

Wait, from earlier, a_r had -k sinθ θ'' term, so let's plug θ'' into that.

So, a_r = (-2k cosθ (θ')² ) -k sinθ θ'' -k (θ')²

Substituting θ'':

= (-2k cosθ (θ')^2) -k sinθ [ (2 sinθ (θ')^2 )/(1 + cosθ) ) ] -k (θ')^2

Let me compute each term:

First term: -2k cosθ (θ')²

Second term: -k sinθ * [ 2 sinθ (θ')² / (1 + cosθ) ) ] = -k [ 2 sin²θ (θ')² / (1 + cosθ) ]

Third term: -k (θ')²

So putting it all together:

a_r = -2k cosθ (θ')² - [ 2k sin²θ (θ')² ]/(1 + cosθ) ) -k (θ')²

Hmm, that's a bit messy. Maybe I can factor out (θ')² and k:

a_r = k (θ')² [ -2 cosθ - (2 sin²θ)/(1 + cosθ) ) -1 ]

Let me compute the expression inside the brackets.

Let me denote the bracket as E:

E = -2 cosθ - [ 2 sin²θ/(1 + cosθ) ] -1

Let me combine the terms:

First, note that sin²θ = 1 - cos²θ = (1 - cosθ)(1 + cosθ)

So, 2 sin²θ/(1 + cosθ) = 2 (1 - cosθ)(1 + cosθ)/(1 + cosθ) ) = 2 (1 - cosθ)

So, substituting back into E:

E = -2 cosθ - [2 (1 - cosθ) ] -1

Simplify:

= -2 cosθ - 2 + 2 cosθ -1

The -2 cosθ and +2 cosθ cancel out:

= (-2 + (-1)) = -3

So E = -3.

Thus, a_r = k (θ')² * (-3) = -3k (θ')²

Hmm, wait, but I need to express this in terms of v, not θ'.

Because the speed v is given as constant.

So, I need to find (θ')² in terms of v.

Earlier, the speed v is given by:

v = sqrt( (dr/dt)^2 + r² (dθ/dt)^2 )

Compute (dr/dt)^2 + r² (θ')² = v².

We know dr/dt = -k sinθ θ'

So, (dr/dt)^2 = k² sin²θ (θ')²

r = k(1 + cosθ), so r² = k² (1 + cosθ)^2

So,

v² = k² sin²θ (θ')² + k² (1 + cosθ)^2 (θ')²

Factor out k² (θ')²:

v² = k² (θ')² [ sin²θ + (1 + cosθ)^2 ]

Expand (1 + cosθ)^2 = 1 + 2 cosθ + cos²θ

So,

sin²θ + 1 + 2 cosθ + cos²θ = (sin²θ + cos²θ) + 1 + 2 cosθ = 1 + 1 + 2 cosθ = 2(1 + cosθ)

So,

v² = k² (θ')² * 2 (1 + cosθ )

Solve for (θ')²:

(θ')² = v² / [ 2 k² (1 + cosθ) ]

So, going back to a_r:

a_r = -3k (θ')² = -3k * [ v² / (2 k² (1 + cosθ)) ) ]

Simplify:

= -3 v² / [ 2k (1 + cosθ) ]

But wait, r = k(1 + cosθ), so 1 + cosθ = r/k.

So,

a_r = -3 v² / ( 2k * (r/k) ) ) = -3 v² / (2 r )

But r = k(1 + cosθ), so substituting back:

a_r = -3 v²/(2 r )

Wait, but from the options, I don't see this exact expression. The options have terms like v²/k, not v²/(2k), etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me go back. So, in the expression for a_r, I had:

a_r = -3k (θ')².

And (θ')² is v² / [ 2 k² (1 + cosθ) ]

So,

a_r = -3k * [ v² / (2 k² (1 + cosθ) ) ) ] = -3 v² / [ 2 k (1 + cosθ) ]

Wait, but 1 + cosθ is r/k. So:

1 + cosθ = r/k → (1 + cosθ) = r/k → denominator becomes 2k*(r/k) )= 2 r.

So,

a_r = (-3 v² )/( 2 r )

But r =k (1 + cosθ), so this is:

= (-3 v² )/( 2 k (1 + cosθ) )

But this seems a bit messy, and none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps I messed up a step earlier. Let me double-check.

Wait, so when I computed (sin²θ + (1 + cosθ)^2 ), I got 2(1 + cosθ). Let me recheck that:

sin²θ + (1 + cosθ)^2 = sin²θ + 1 + 2 cosθ + cos²θ.

= (sin²θ + cos²θ) + 1 + 2 cosθ = 1 + 1 + 2 cosθ = 2 (1 + cosθ). Yes, correct.

So, that part is correct.

Then v² = k² (θ')² * 2 (1 + cosθ)

So, (θ')² = v² / [ 2 k² (1 + cosθ) ) ]

So, a_r = -3k (θ')² → substitution:

= -3k * [ v²/(2 k² (1 + cosθ)) ) ] 

= -3 v² / ( 2k (1 + cosθ) )

Hmm, but the options are expressed in terms of v²/k, so perhaps I should write this as:

a_r = (-3 v²) / (2k (1 + cosθ) )

But 1 + cosθ = r/k, so:

a_r = (-3 v²) / ( 2k * (r/k) ) ) = (-3 v²) / ( 2 r ) 

Wait, but that's not helping. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express (1 + cosθ) in terms of r.

Wait, r = k(1 + cosθ) → 1 + cosθ = r/k.

So, 1/(1 + cosθ) = k/r.

So, a_r = (-3 v²) / [ 2k (1 + cosθ) ] = (-3 v²) * (k/r) ) / (2k )

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me compute it again.

Wait, 1/(1 + cosθ) = k/r, because 1 + cosθ = r/k.

So,

a_r = (-3 v²) / [ 2k (1 + cosθ) ) ] = (-3 v²) * (1/(1 + cosθ)) / (2k )

= (-3 v² ) * (k/r) / (2k )

Because 1/(1 + cosθ) = k/r.

So,

= (-3 v²) * (k) ) / (2k r )

The k's cancel:

= (-3 v² ) / (2 r )

Hmm, but I'm still not getting an answer in terms of v²/k. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute this differently. Let me think about another approach.

Since the particle is moving with constant speed, the acceleration is purely centripetal, so a = v² / R, where R is the radius of curvature.

Wait, but the radial component of acceleration a_r is equal to v² / R, but with a negative sign because it's directed inward? Or wait, the magnitude would be v² / R.

But the problem is asking for a · e_r, which is the component of acceleration in the radial direction. So perhaps this is simply the centripetal acceleration, which is v² divided by the radius of curvature.

Wait, but the radius of curvature for a polar curve r = r(θ) is given by:

R = [ r² + (dr/dθ)^2 ]^(3/2) / | r² + 2 (dr/dθ)^2 - r (d²r/dθ²) |^(1/2) )

Wait, maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, the formula for radius of curvature for a polar curve is:

R = [ (r^2 + (dr/dθ)^2 )^(3/2) ] / [ r^2 + 2 (dr/dθ)^2 - r (d²r/dθ²) ]

Wait, perhaps that's a bit too involved. Alternatively, knowing that for a cardioid r = k(1 + cosθ), the radius of curvature is known. Let me recall that.

Wait, I think the radius of curvature for a cardioid is 4k sinθ/2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's more efficient to look for another way.

Wait, another approach: since the speed is constant, the radial acceleration a_r is equal to - (v² / R), where R is the radius of curvature.

But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the radial component of acceleration is v² / R, but R is the radius of curvature. So a · e_r = v² / R.

Wait, but in polar coordinates, the radial
