Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about Rawls and his claims regarding students with fewer native assets. I'm a bit rusty on my philosophy, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that John Rawls was a political philosopher known for his theory of justice, particularly "Justice as Fairness." His work, especially "A Theory of Justice," talks a lot about how society should distribute resources and opportunities.

Rawls introduced the concept of the "original position," where people imagine they're behind a "veil of ignorance," not knowing their place in society, including their talents, intelligence, or other native assets. The idea is that from this position, people would agree on principles of justice that ensure fairness, especially for the least advantaged.

One of the key principles Rawls discusses is the "difference principle." If I recall correctly, this principle allows for inequalities in the distribution of goods and services, but only if those inequalities benefit the least advantaged members of society. So, any unequal distribution should work to improve the situation of those who are worse off.

In the context of education, this would mean that resources shouldn't just be given to those who are naturally more gifted because that might widen the gap between the more and less advantaged. Instead, resources should be allocated in a way that helps those who are less fortunate, ensuring they have opportunities to succeed.

Looking at the question, it's about students with fewer native assets, like intelligence. The options suggest different ways resources might be distributed. So, applying Rawls' principles, the correct approach would be to give more resources to those who need them more to level the playing field.

Let me go through the options:

A: Same level of attention and resources. That doesn't help the less advantaged; it just treats everyone equally, which might not address the inequality.

B: Based on social background. Not sure if Rawls specifically targets social background; his focus is more on natural assets and ensuring fairness.

C: Willingness to learn. That's more about effort, which isn't directly tied to Rawls' focus on native assets.

D: Economic background. Again, Rawls' difference principle is about natural assets, not just economic status.

E: Less attention. That would make things worse for the less advantaged, which contradicts Rawls.

F: Entirely different resources. Not sure what this means, but it doesn't sound like Rawls' approach.

G: Virtually no resources. Definitely not, as that would neglect the less advantaged.

H: Opportunity to compete. While fair competition is good, Rawls might argue that without equal resources, competition isn't fair.

I: More attention and resources. This aligns with the difference principle, helping those with fewer assets to improve their situation.

J: Only basic education. That seems too limited and doesn't provide the support needed.

So, the answer should be I: more attention and resources than those with more native assets.

The correct answer is based on Rawls' principle of justice, which advocates for redistributing resources to benefit the least advantaged. This aligns with option I, where students with fewer native assets receive more resources to ensure fairness and equal opportunities.

Answer: I
