Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the work done when dragging a mass. Hmm, I remember that work is related to force and distance. Let me think.

The question says a 150 kg mass is dragged 10 meters with a coefficient of sliding friction of 0.30. I need to find the work done in joules. Oh right, work done against friction would be the frictional force multiplied by the distance.

Wait, how do I find the frictional force? Oh, right, the formula for friction force is the coefficient (mu) times the normal force. And the normal force is equal to the weight of the object when it's on a flat surface. So normal force N = mass * gravity. Gravity is 9.8 m/sÂ².

So let me plug in the numbers. Mass is 150 kg. So N is 150 * 9.8. Let me calculate that. 150 times 9 is 1350, and 150 times 0.8 is 120, so total N is 1470 Newtons.

Then frictional force F_friction is mu * N. Mu is 0.30, so 0.3 * 1470. Let me calculate that. 1470 divided by 10 is 147, so 0.3 times 1470 is 441. So F_friction is 441 N.

Now, work done is force times distance if they're in the same direction. Since the force is opposing the motion, the work done by friction is negative, but the work done against friction (which is what's being asked here) would be positive. So I think we just take the absolute value.

So the distance is 10 meters. So work W = F_friction * distance = 441 N * 10 m = 4410 joules. Hmm, looking at the options, I see option I is 4410 joules. So the answer should be I.

Wait, but sometimes I get confused about whether to use g as 9.8 or 10 for simplification. Oh, but in this case, using 9.8 gives more precise numbers. So 150 *9.8 is definitely 1470, and 0.3 *1470 is 441. So yes, 441 *10 is 4410 J.

So I'm pretty confident the answer is option I: 4410 joules.

To calculate the work done when dragging a mass of 150 kg a distance of 10 meters with a coefficient of sliding friction of 0.30, we proceed as follows:

1. **Determine the normal force**:  
   The normal force \( N \) is equal to the weight of the object, which is given by:  
   \[
   N = m \cdot g = 150 \, \text{kg} \cdot 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 1470 \, \text{N}
   \]

2. **Calculate the frictional force**:  
   The frictional force \( F_{\text{friction}} \) is given by:  
   \[
   F_{\text{friction}} = \mu \cdot N = 0.30 \cdot 1470 \, \text{N} = 441 \, \text{N}
   \]

3. **Compute the work done**:  
   The work done against friction is the product of the frictional force and the distance:  
   \[
   W = F_{\text{friction}} \cdot d = 441 \, \text{N} \cdot 10 \, \text{m} = 4410 \, \text{J}
   \]

Thus, the work done is **4410 joules**, which corresponds to option **I**.
