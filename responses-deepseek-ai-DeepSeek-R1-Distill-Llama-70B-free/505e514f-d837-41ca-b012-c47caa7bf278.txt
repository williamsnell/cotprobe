Okay, so I have this question about self-monitoring and how people decide how to act in social situations. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that self-monitoring is a concept by Mark Snyder. From what I learned, self-monitoring refers to the extent to which people regulate their behavior based on their surroundings and social cues. So, people who are high in self-monitoring tend to adjust their behavior a lot depending on the situation, while low self-monitors are more consistent and less likely to change based on external factors.

The question is asking what a low self-monitoring person relies on when deciding how to act. So, I think low self-monitors are more likely to stick with their own internal states rather than external cues. They probably don't change their behavior much just to fit in or impress others. Instead, they might rely on their own feelings, attitudes, or beliefs.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Life scripts. I'm not too sure what that refers to. Maybe like a set of routines they follow? Not sure if that's directly related.

Option B: Past experiences. That could make sense because maybe they use what worked before. But I'm not certain if that's specific to self-monitors.

Option C: Advice from friends or family. That's more of an external source, so maybe high self-monitors would do that more? Because they're attuned to others' opinions.

Option D: Random decisions. That doesn't seem right. People usually have some reasoning, even if it's internal.

Option E: Societal norms. Again, that's external. High self-monitors probably care more about this.

Option F: Internal models from infancy. That sounds like attachment styles or something, not directly related to self-monitoring.

Option G: Popular trends. Definitely external and more for high self-monitors.

Option H: Others' emotional reactions. That's external, so high self-monitors would pay attention. Low self-monitors might not as much.

Option I: Authority figures. Again, external, so probably not for low self-monitors.

Option J: Their own feelings, attitudes, and beliefs. That fits with what I was thinking earlier. Low self-monitors rely on their internal states rather than external cues.

So I'm leaning towards option J as the correct answer.

The concept of self-monitoring, as introduced by Mark Snyder, describes the degree to which individuals adjust their behavior based on social cues and external factors. Low self-monitors tend to be less influenced by external expectations and more guided by their internal states, such as their own feelings, attitudes, and beliefs. 

Analyzing the options, external factors like societal norms (E), advice from friends or family (C), or the emotional reactions of others (H) are more relevant to high self-monitors. Internal consistency and personal principles align more with low self-monitors, making option J the most appropriate choice.

Answer: J
