Question:

A suspected drug dealer was arrested after selling three grams of cocaine to undercover police agents. He was subsequently convicted in state court of possession with intent to distribute narcotics. Following his conviction, the drug dealer was sentenced to a prison term of 10 years. After being sentenced, the drug dealer's attorney appealed the conviction, citing jury misconduct. While his appeal was pending, the drug dealer was then indicted by both a federal and a state grand jury for conspiracy to distribute the same cocaine. The drug dealer's attorney filed motions to dismiss each of the new indictments on the grounds that they violate double jeopardy. In all likelihood, double jeopardy requires the dismissal of

Options:

A: both indictments.
B: the federal indictment, if the state indictment is dismissed.
C: both indictments, if the appeal is successful.
D: the state indictment, if the federal court conviction is upheld.
E: neither of the indictments.
F: the federal indictment, but not the state indictment.
G: the state indictment, but not the federal indictment.
H: the federal indictment, if the state court conviction is upheld.
I: both indictments, if the appeal is unsuccessful.
J: the state indictment, if the federal indictment is dismissed.

Okay, so I have this question about double jeopardy, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but let's try to work through it. The scenario is about a drug dealer who's been through several legal steps, and now we have to determine whether the new indictments violate double jeopardy.

So, the facts: The drug dealer sold three grams of cocaine to undercover police. He was convicted in state court of possession with intent to distribute. Then he was sentenced to 10 years. His attorney appealed, citing jury misconduct. While that appeal was pending, he was indicted by both a federal and a state grand jury for conspiracy to distribute the same cocaine. His attorney is moving to dismiss both on double jeopardy grounds.

Double jeopardy, as I remember, is from the Fifth Amendment, which says you can't be tried twice for the same offense after jeopardy has attached. But there are exceptions, especially when it comes to state and federal prosecutions. Oh right, the dual sovereignty doctrine. So, each sovereign (state and federal) can prosecute for the same conduct because they're separate jurisdictions. So, the state can prosecute, and the federal government can prosecute the same person for the same acts without violating double jeopardy.

Wait, but in this case, both new indictments are happening after the initial state conviction. So, the state indicted him again, and the federal government also indicted him. The question is whether these new indictments after the conviction are allowed.

Wait a second, the timing here. He was convicted in state court, then appealed. So the initial state case is on appeal. Now, while on appeal, both the state and federal governments indict him for conspiracy related to the same cocaine.

So, the issue is whether these new charges are for the same offense as the prior conviction. The initial charge was possession with intent to distribute. The new charges are conspiracy to distribute. Are these the same offense under the Blockburger test?

Blockburger test says that if each offense requires proof of a fact the other doesn't, they're not the same offense. So, possession with intent requires possession and intent to distribute. Conspiracy requires an agreement to commit a crime. So, they are different offenses because the elements are different. So, even within the same sovereign, prosecuting for both wouldn't be double jeopardy because they're separate offenses.

Wait, but the initial state case was possession with intent, and the new state charge is conspiracy. So, under state law, would they be considered the same offense? If they're not, then the state can prosecute again. Similarly, the federal conspiracy charge is a different offense from the state's possession charge.

But wait, the initial state case's conviction is on appeal. So, in the state system, if the first conviction is overturned on appeal, would that change anything? Because if the conviction is reversed, then the state might have to retry him, but that's a different issue. But here, the new state and federal indictments are happening while the appeal is pending. So, the state is trying to charge him again, perhaps for a different offense arising from the same conduct.

But the initial state case was for possession with intent, and now the state is charging conspiracy. If conspiracy is a separate offense under state law, then the state can bring that charge. So the state indictment for conspiracy wouldn't be barred by double jeopardy because it's a different offense. Similarly, the federal indictment for conspiracy would also not be barred because the federal government is a separate sovereign.

Wait, but in some cases, the same sovereign can't prosecute twice for the same offense. But here, the state's first case was possession with intent; the second is conspiracy. Different offenses, so no problem. The federal case is a separate sovereign, so regardless, they can prosecute.

So, the motions to dismiss both indictments on double jeopardy grounds would likely fail. Therefore, neither the state nor the federal indictment would be dismissed.

Wait, but let me think again. The initial state case's appeal is pending. So, if the appeal is successful, and the conviction is overturned, then the state might have to retry him for possession with intent. But that's not the issue here. The new state indictment is for conspiracy, which is a different charge. So, regardless of the appeal's outcome, the state can bring a new charge for a different offense based on the same conduct.

So, the answer here is that double jeopardy doesn't require dismissal of either indictment. So the correct answer would be option E: neither of the indictments.

Double jeopardy, as protected under the Fifth Amendment, prevents a person from being tried twice for the same offense by the same sovereign after jeopardy has attached. However, the dual sovereignty doctrine allows separate prosecutions by state and federal governments for the same conduct, as they are considered different sovereigns. 

In this case, the drug dealer was initially convicted in state court for possession with intent to distribute narcotics. The new indictments—one by the state for conspiracy to distribute and another by the federal government for the same offense—involve different charges. Under the Blockburger test, possession with intent to distribute and conspiracy to distribute are distinct offenses because they require proof of different elements. Therefore, the state and federal prosecutions for conspiracy do not violate double jeopardy.

Additionally, even though the initial state conviction is on appeal, the new state indictment for conspiracy represents a separate offense under state law, and the federal indictment is permissible under the dual sovereignty doctrine. As a result, neither the state nor the federal indictment is barred by double jeopardy.

The correct answer is:

**E: neither of the indictments.**
