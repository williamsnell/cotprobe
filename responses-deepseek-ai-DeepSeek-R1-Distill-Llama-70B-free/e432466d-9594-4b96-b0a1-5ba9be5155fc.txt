Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about daydreams and how they differ from regular dreams. Hmm, I need to figure out the right answer. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I should probably recall what I know about daydreams and dreams. Daydreams happen when you're awake, right? Like when you're just zoning out during the day, imagining things. They're usually under your control, I think. You can kind of guide what you're daydreaming about. And they're often related to your current thoughts or wishes, maybe even things you want to happen.

On the other hand, regular dreams occur when you're asleep. They're not under your control, or at least not consciously. Dreams can be weird, illogical, and sometimes really vivid. You might not remember them clearly after waking up. Also, I've heard that dreams might have some connection to your subconscious thoughts or unresolved issues, but I'm not sure about that.

Looking at the options now. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Dreams are involuntary visual experiences during sleep, daydreams are involuntary during wakefulness. Wait, I thought daydreams are voluntary because you can choose to think about something. So maybe A is incorrect because it says both are involuntary. Or does daydreaming happen without control? Hmm, maybe I'm wrong here. Sometimes daydreams just pop into your head without you trying, so perhaps they are involuntary. Not sure yet.

Option B: Dreams are subconscious desires, daydreams are just for fun with no deeper meaning. I think daydreams can also have deeper meanings, like wish fulfillment. So B might not be correct because it dismisses daydreams as having no meaning.

Option C: Daydreams are remembered in detail, while dreams are forgotten. I think it's the opposite. Dreams are often hard to remember, but when you do, they can be detailed. Daydreams, since you're awake, you probably remember them better. So C might be correct, but I'm not certain. Wait, actually, when you daydream, you're aware of your thoughts, so you remember them. But sometimes you might forget your daydreams too, depending on how focused you were. Not sure if this is the key difference.

Option D: Daydreams occur at night, dreams any time. No, that's wrong. Daydreams are during the day when you're awake, and dreams during sleep. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Daydreams are controlled and related to reality, while dreams are uncontrolled and you don't realize you're dreaming. That seems right. Daydreams are more under your control and connected to real-life thoughts, whereas dreams aren't controlled and you're not aware you're dreaming (unless it's a lucid dream, but that's not the norm). So E looks like a strong candidate.

Option F: Dreams are controlled by waking consciousness. No, that's not true. Dreams aren't under your control, so F is wrong.

Option G: Daydreams are sleep dreams. No, that's incorrect because daydreams happen while awake.

Option H: They share the same characteristics. No, they're different in when and how they occur, so H is wrong.

Option I: Daydreams are a type of dream while awake, involving wish fulfillment. That sounds partially correct. Daydreams are while awake, and they often involve wishes. So I might be a contender. But how does it differ from E? I says they're a type of dream, but maybe the distinction is that E talks about control and relation to reality.

Option J: Dreams are realistic, daydreams fantastical. I don't think that's accurate. Dreams can be really bizarre and unrealistic, while daydreams can be more grounded. So J might not be correct.

Wait, so comparing E and I. E says daydreams are controlled and related to reality, while I says daydreams are a type of dream during wakefulness involving wish fulfillment. Both seem plausible.

But the question is about how they differ from each other. So the main points are: daydreams occur during wakefulness, are under control, and related to reality. Dreams are during sleep, not controlled, and not related to reality.

So looking back, option E seems to capture that difference accurately. Daydreams are controlled and related to reality, while dreams aren't controlled and the person isn't aware they're dreaming.

Wait, but option I says daydreams are a type of dream while awake. That's technically correct, but the question is about the difference. So perhaps E is better because it explains the control aspect and reality relation.

So I think the correct answer is E.

E: Daydreams are fantasies created during a waking state which are controlled and closely related to reality, while dreams are not under control and the individual does not realize that he is dreaming.
