Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem to solve, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that air inside a chamber is heated, and it expands from an initial volume of 1.0 cubic foot to a final volume of 8.0 cubic feet. The initial pressure is 1500 psia. The process is quasi-static and follows the relation PV^1.4 = constant. I need to calculate the total work done by the gas, and choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that work done by a gas during expansion can be calculated using the formula for work in a quasi-static process, which is the integral of P dV from the initial volume V1 to the final volume V2. But since the process follows PV^n = constant (where n is 1.4 here), this is a polytropic process. I think I can use the formula for work done in a polytropic process.

The formula for work done (W) in a polytropic process where PV^n = C is:

W = (P1 * V1 - P2 * V2) / (n - 1)

Wait, no, wait. I think I might have that mixed up. Let me think again. Another version of the formula is W = (P1 V1^n - P2 V2^n) / (n-1) ) * some factor. Or maybe I should express P in terms of V for the integral.

Right, the general approach for work done is the integral from V1 to V2 of P dV. Since PV^n = C, I can express P as C / V^n. But C can be found from the initial conditions: P1 V1^n = C.

So, substituting, P = (P1 V1^n) / V^n.

Then the integral becomes integral from V1 to V2 of (P1 V1^n / V^n) dV.

That integral would be P1 V1^n * integral from V1 to V2 of V^(-n) dV.

The integral of V^(-n) dV is [V^(-n +1)] / (-n +1) evaluated from V1 to V2.

So putting it all together, the work W is P1 V1^n [ (V2^(-n +1) - V1^(-n +1)) / (-n +1) ) ]

Wait, let me calculate that step by step.

Let me compute the integral:

∫P dV from V1 to V2 = ∫ (C / V^n) dV from V1 to V2.

Since C = P1 V1^n, substituting that in:

P1 V1^n ∫ (1/V^n) dV from V1 to V2.

The integral of 1/V^n dV is [ V^{ -n +1 } / ( -n +1 ) ) ] evaluated from V1 to V2.

So the whole expression becomes:

W = P1 V1^n [ (V2^{(-n +1)} - V1^{(-n +1)}) / ( -n +1 ) ) ]

Alternatively, since (-n +1) is (1 -n ), I can write it as:

W = (P1 V1^n) ( V2^{(1 -n)} - V1^{(1 -n)} ) / (1 -n )

Wait, that seems a bit messy, but maybe I can factor this differently. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out the negative sign to make it look better.

Wait, another approach: Let me factor the denominator as (1 -n ), which is the same as -(n-1). So:

W = (P1 V1^n) [ ( V2^{1-n} - V1^{1 -n} ) ] / (1 -n )

Multiply numerator and denominator by -1 to get:

W = (P1 V1^n) [ ( V1^{1 -n} - V2^{1 -n} ) ] / (n -1 )

Hmm, that might be a cleaner way to write it.

Wait, but I've seen another formula where the work done for a polytropic process is:

W = ( P2 V2 - P1 V1 ) / (n -1 )

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because if n=1, which is an isothermal process, the formula would give division by zero, but in isothermal processes, the work is P1 V1 ln(V2/V1), which is different.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of P and V. Since PV^n = C,

P1 V1^n = P2 V2^n = C.

So, P2 = P1 (V1/V2)^n.

Thus, I can express P2 in terms of P1, V1, V2, and n.

So, knowing that, perhaps I can use another approach for calculating the work.

Wait, the formula for work in a polytropic process is:

W = [ P1 V1 - P2 V2 ] / (n - 1 )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me confirm this.

Alternatively, I can use the formula:

W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2) / (1 - n) )

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to derive it properly.

Given that P V^n = C.

So, P = C / V^n.

Work done is the integral from V1 to V2 of P dV.

So,

W = ∫ (C / V^n) dV from V1 to V2.

= C ∫ V^{-n} dV from V1 to V2.

= C [ V^{-n +1} / (-n +1) ) ] from V1 to V2.

= C [ (V2^{1-n} - V1^{1-n}) ) / (1 -n) ) ]

But C is P1 V1^n.

So,

W = P1 V1^n * [ (V2^{1-n} - V1^{1-n}) ) / (1 -n) ) ]

Factor out the negative from denominator:

W = P1 V1^n * [ (V1^{1-n} - V2^{1-n}) ) / (n -1) ) ]

So,

W = P1 V1^n ( V1^{1 -n} - V2^{1 -n} ) / (n -1 )

Simplify V1^n * V1^{1-n} = V1^{n +1 -n} = V1^1 = V1.

Similarly, V1^n * V2^{1-n} = V1^n V2^{1 -n} = (V1/V2)^n * V2.

Wait, perhaps I can factor this differently.

Wait, let me compute the numerator:

V1^n (V1^{1 -n} - V2^{1 -n}) ) = V1^{n +1 -n} - V1^n V2^{1 -n} = V1 - V1^n V2^{1-n}.

Hmm, but that might not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps factor out V1:

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the expression step by step.

Let me plug in the values:

Given:

n = 1.4

P1 = 1500 psia

V1 = 1.0 ft^3

V2 = 8.0 ft^3

Compute W using the formula:

W = [ P1 V1^n ( V1^{1 -n} - V2^{1 -n} ) ] / (n -1 )

Alternatively, since P1 V1^n is P1 * V1^{1.4}.

So,

Compute each part:

First, calculate V1^{1 -n} = 1.0^{1 -1.4} = 1.0^{-0.4} = 1.

Similarly, V2^{1 -n} = 8.0^{-0.4}.

Compute 8^(-0.4). Let's see, 8 is 2^3, so 8^0.4 = (2^3)^0.4 = 2^{1.2} ≈ 2.2974. Therefore, 8^(-0.4) ≈ 1/2.2974 ≈ 0.4353.

So,

V1^{1-n} - V2^{1-n} = 1 - 0.4353 ≈ 0.5647.

Now, compute P1 V1^n: 1500 psia * (1.0 ft^3)^1.4 = 1500 *1 = 1500.

Multiply by (0.5647): 1500 * 0.5647 ≈ 846.9.

Now, the denominator is (n -1) = 1.4 -1 = 0.4.

So, W ≈ 846.9 / 0.4 ≈ 2117.25 ft^3-psia.

Wait, but the options are in ft-lbf. I need to convert psia-ft^3 to ft-lbf.

I remember that 1 ft^3-psia is equal to 1 (ft-lbf)/in^2 * ft^3. But wait, another approach: 1 ft-lbf is equal to pressure times area times displacement. Alternatively, perhaps I should recall the conversion factor.

Wait, 1 psia = 1 pound per square inch absolute.

So, 1 ft^3-psia = (1 lb/in²) * (1 ft^3) = (1 lb) * (1 ft^3) / (in²).

But to convert this to ft-lbf, I need to express 1 ft^3-psia in terms of ft-lbf.

Wait, 1 ft = 12 inches. So, 1 ft² = (12 in)^2 = 144 in².

So, 1 ft^3-psia = (1 lb/in²) * (1 ft^3) = (1 lb) * (1 ft^3) / (in²).

Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to use unit conversion:

We know that 1 ft^3-psia = 1 (lb/in²) * 1 ft^3.

We can convert this to ft-lbf by multiplying by the number of in² in a ft² and the number of ft in a ft (which is just 1, but perhaps I need to think about the volume in terms of area times length.)

Wait, perhaps the correct way is:

Work in ft-lbf is equal to pressure in psia multiplied by volume in cubic feet multiplied by a conversion factor.

I think the conversion factor is 1 ft^3-psia = 778.169 ft-lbf approximately. Wait, that's the number I remember, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think about the units.

Wait, 1 psia is 1 pound per square inch. So, 1 ft^3-psia is (1 lb/in²) * (1 ft^3) = (1 lb) * (1 ft^3) / (in²).

Now, since 1 ft = 12 inches, 1 ft^2 = 144 in². So, 1 ft^3 = 1 ft^2 * 1 ft = 144 in² * 1 ft.

So, 1 ft^3-psia = (1 lb) * (144 in² * 1 ft) ) / (in²) )

The in² in the denominator cancels with the in² in the numerator, leaving:

(1 lb) * 144 ft.

Wait, that can't be right, because that would make 1 ft^3-psia = 144 lb-ft, which is 144 ft-lbf.

Wait, that seems high, but let me check the calculation again.

Wait, 1 ft^3 = (12 in)^3 = 1728 in^3.

1 psia is 1 lb/in².

So, 1 ft^3-psia = 1 lb/in² * 1728 in^3.

But 1 in^3 is (1/12 ft)^3 = 1/1728 ft^3.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me think differently.

Work in ft-lbf is given by force times distance. Force is pressure times area.

So, P (in lb/ft²) multiplied by area (in ft²) gives force in lb. Then, displacement in ft, so work is P * A * d → but in this case, we're integrating P dV, where dV is area times displacement, so it's P dV.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the conversion factor directly. I think 1 psia-ft^3 equals 778.169 ft-lbf.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused, but I'll proceed with that number for now.

So, W in ft-lbf is 778.169 multiplied by the value in psia-ft^3.

Wait, but wait, when I computed the work earlier, I got approximately 2117.25 psia-ft^3.

Wait, no, wait: Let me recap. I computed W = [1500 * (1^1.4) * (1^{-0.4} - 8^{-0.4}) ] / (0.4 )

Wait, no, let me check the numbers again.

Wait, the formula I used was W = (P1 V1^n (V1^{1-n} - V2^{1-n})) / (n -1 )

Plugging the numbers:

P1 = 1500 psia

V1 = 1.0 ft³

n = 1.4

V2 = 8.0 ft³

So,

V1^{1-n} = 1^{0.6} = 1.0.

V2^{1-n} = 8^{-0.4} ≈ 0.4353.

So, (1 - 0.4353) ≈ 0.5647.

Multiply by P1 V1^n: 1500 * 1^1.4 = 1500.

So, 1500 * 0.5647 ≈ 846.9.

Divide by (n -1) = 0.4 → 846.9 / 0.4 ≈ 2117.25 psia-ft³.

Now, to convert psia-ft³ to ft-lbf, I need to multiply by 778.169.

Wait, that would give 2117.25 * 778.169 ≈ which is way larger than any of the options given, which are in the range of 100,000 to 500,000. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the conversion factor.

Wait, perhaps the correct conversion is 1 psia-ft³ equals 778.169 ft-lbf? That would make 2117.25 * 778 ≈ 1,648,600 ft-lbf, which is way too high. But the options don't go that high. So I must have made a mistake in the conversion factor.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the conversion factor. Let me think again.

I recall that 1 horsepower = 550 ft-lbf per second, and 1 psia-ft³ is related to BTUs, but perhaps I should find a more direct conversion.

Wait, another approach: 1 ft-lbf is the work done when a force of 1 lbf is applied over a distance of 1 foot.

Pressure is force per area, so 1 psia is 1 lbf per square inch. So, 1 psia * 1 cubic foot is (1 lbf/in²) * (12 in)^3 = 1 lbf/in² * 1728 in³ = 1728 lbf * in.

But 1 foot is 12 inches, so 1 ft = 12 in → 1 in = 1/12 ft.

So, 1728 lbf * in = 1728 lbf * (1/12 ft) ) = 144 lbf-ft.

Ah! So 1 psia-ft³ equals 144 ft-lbf.

That makes more sense. So, the work done in psia-ft³ is 2117.25, so multiply by 144 to get ft-lbf.

So, W ≈ 2117.25 * 144 ≈ let me compute that.

2117.25 * 144:

Let me compute 2000 * 144 = 288,000.

117.25 * 144:

100 * 144 = 14,400

17.25 * 144: 17 * 144 = 2448, 0.25 * 144 = 36 → 2448 + 36 = 2484

So, 14,400 + 2484 = 16,884.

So total is 288,000 + 16,884 = 304,884 ft-lbf.

Looking at the options, option B is 305,000 ft-lbf, which is very close. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but I should double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Let me recompute the value of V2^{1 -n} where n=1.4, so 1 -n = -0.4.

V2 is 8 ft³.

So, 8^(-0.4) = 1/(8^0.4).

8^0.4 is the same as 2^(3*0.4) = 2^1.2 ≈ 2.2974.

So, 1/2.2974 ≈ 0.4353.

So, that's correct.

Then, the term (1 - 0.4353) is 0.5647.

Multiply by P1 V1^n: 1500 * 1 = 1500 * 0.5647 ≈ 846.9.

Divide by 0.4 gives 2117.25 psia-ft³.

Multiply by 144 (conversion factor) gives 2117.25 * 144 ≈ 304,884 ≈ 305,000 ft-lbf. So option B is correct.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the formula. Let me check the formula again.

The formula for work done in a polytropic process PV^n = C is:

W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2) / (n - 1)

Wait, is that correct?

Because if that's the case, I can compute it another way.

Compute P2 using P1 V1^n = P2 V2^n → P2 = P1 (V1 / V2)^n.

So, P2 = 1500 * (1/8)^1.4.

Compute (1/8)^1.4: 8 is 2^3, so (1/8)^1.4 = (2^-3)^1.4 = 2^(-4.2) ≈ 0.05766.

So, P2 = 1500 * 0.05766 ≈ 86.
