Okay, so I've got this problem about capacitors connected in series, and I'm supposed to find the total energy stored when a certain voltage is applied. Hmm, I remember that capacitors in series have some specific formulas to calculate their combined capacitance. Let me think.

So the problem says there's a 3 microfarad capacitor and a 6 microfarad capacitor connected in series. The potential difference across the combination is 300 volts. I need to find the total energy stored.

Wait, I think the first step is to find the equivalent capacitance of the two in series. Oh right, when capacitors are in series, the reciprocal of the equivalent capacitance is the sum of the reciprocals of each capacitance. So the formula is 1/C_eq = 1/C1 + 1/C2.

C1 is 3 microfarads, which is 3e-6 F, and C2 is 6e-6 F. Let me plug those in. So 1/C_eq = 1/(3e-6) + 1/(6e-6). Let me compute that. 1/(3e-6) is approximately 333,333.333, and 1/(6e-6) is 166,666.666. Adding them together gives 500,000. So 1/C_eq = 500,000, which means C_eq is 1/500,000. Let me calculate that. 1 divided by 5e5 is 2e-6 F, which is 2 microfarads.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that. Because 1/(3e-6) is (1/3e-6) = 1/(0.000003) = 333,333.333... Similarly, 1/(6e-6) is 166,666.666... Adding them together gives 500,000 exactly. So yes, C_eq is 2e-6 F, or 2 microfarads.

Now, the potential difference across the entire combination is 300 volts. So the energy stored in a capacitor is given by U = ½ C V². But wait, since they're in series, the voltage is divided between them, right? Or is it the same as the equivalent capacitance approach?

Wait, no, because when you connect capacitors in series, the same charge Q builds up on each. So the energy stored in each can be found using U = Q²/(2C), and the total energy would be the sum of each individual energy.

Alternatively, since the equivalent capacitance is 2 microfarads, the energy stored in the equivalent capacitor would be U = ½ * C_eq * V². Let me calculate that.

So C_eq is 2e-6 F, V is 300 V. So U = 0.5 * 2e-6 * (300)^2. Let's compute that step by step.

First, compute (300)^2. That's 90,000. Then 0.5 * 2e-6 is 1e-6. So 1e-6 * 90,000 is 0.09 J. Wait, but that would be 0.09 J. Hmm, looking at the options, I see option H is 0.09 J. But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct because I'm thinking about the individual capacitors.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the energy in each capacitor separately and sum them up. Let's try that approach.

Since the capacitors are in series, the same charge Q is on each. So Q = C1 * V1 = C2 * V2. Also, the total voltage V = V1 + V2 = 300 V.

So, from Q = C1 V1 and Q = C2 V2, we get C1 V1 = C2 V2. So V2 = (C1/C2) V1.

Since C1 is 3 microfarad and C2 is 6, that's V2 = (3/6) V1 = 0.5 V1.

Now, V1 + V2 = 300. Substituting, V1 + 0.5 V1 = 300 → 1.5 V1 = 300 → V1 = 200 V. Then V2 = 100 V.

Now, the energy in each capacitor is U1 = ½ C1 V1² and U2 = ½ C2 V2².

Compute U1: 0.5 * 3e-6 F * (200)^2. 200 squared is 40,000. So 0.5 * 3e-6 * 4e4 = 0.5 * 3 * 4e1 (since 1e-6 * 1e4 is 1e-2, so 4e4 * 3e-6 is 0.12). Wait, let me calculate it precisely.

3e-6 * 4e4 = 3 * 4 * 1e-6 * 1e4 = 12 * 1e-2 = 0.12. Then 0.5 * 0.12 = 0.06 J for U1.

Now U2: 0.5 * 6e-6 F * (100)^2. 100 squared is 10,000. So 0.5 * 6e-6 * 1e4 = 0.5 * 6 * 1e-2 (since 1e-6 *1e4 is 1e-2). So 6e-2 is 0.06, multiplied by 0.5 gives 0.03 J.

Wait, that doesn't add up. Because 0.06 + 0.03 = 0.09 J. So that's the same as the earlier method. So the total energy is 0.09 J. But wait, that would be option H.

But let me think again. Because when computing using the equivalent capacitance, I got 0.09 J. When computing each capacitor and adding, I also got 0.09 J. So that's consistent.

But looking back at the options, option H is 0.09 J. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but the options include E: 0.36 J and I: 0.18 J. Hmm. Did I make a miscalculation somewhere?

Let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I messed up the exponents.

Wait, let's recompute using the equivalent capacitance approach.

C_eq = 2 microfarad = 2e-6 F.

V = 300 V.

U = ½ * C * V² = 0.5 * 2e-6 * (300)^2.

Compute 300^2: 90,000.

So 0.5 * 2e-6 = 1e-6.

1e-6 * 90,000 = 0.09 J. That's same as before.

Now, let's recompute the individual energies.

V1 is 200 V, C1 is 3e-6.

U1 = 0.5 * 3e-6 * (200)^2 = 0.5 * 3e-6 *4e4 = 0.5 * (3 *4) * (e-6 * e4) ) = 0.5 *12 * 1e-2 = 0.5 * 0.12 = 0.06 J.

V2 is 100 V, C2 is 6e-6.

U2 = 0.5 *6e-6 * (100)^2 = 0.5 *6e-6 *1e4 = 0.5 *6 * (1e-6 *1e4 )= 0.5 *6 * 1e-2 = 0.5 *0.06 = 0.03 J.

Adding U1 and U2: 0.06 +0.03 =0.09 J.

So both methods give 0.09 J, which is option H.

But wait, the problem is in microfarads, and I think I might have made a mistake in the exponents. Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, 3 microfarad is 3e-6 F, and 6e-6 F.

So when computing U1: 0.5 * 3e-6 F * (200)^2.

200^2 is 4e4, so 3e-6 *4e4 = 12e-2 = 0.12. Multiply by 0.5, gives 0.06 J.

Similarly, for U2: 0.5 *6e-6 * (100)^2.

100^2 is 1e4, so 6e-6 *1e4 =6e-2 =0.06. Multiply by 0.5 gives 0.03 J.

Yes, adding to 0.09 J. So option H.

But wait, the options don't list H as 0.09 J. Let me check the options again. The options were:

Options:

A:0.41 J

B:0.63

C:0.72

D:0.81

E:0.36

F:0.45

G:0.54

H:0.09

I:0.18

J:0.27

Yes, option H is 0.09 J. So the correct answer should be H.

Wait, but wait a minute, I'm a bit confused because when I look back at the initial problem statement, the capacitors are 3 microfarad and 6 microfarad. So their equivalent is 2 microfarad. The calculation seems correct. So the total energy is 0.09 J, which is option H.

To determine the total energy stored in the two capacitors, we first calculate the equivalent capacitance of the series combination. The formula for the equivalent capacitance \( C_{\text{eq}} \) of capacitors in series is:

\[
\frac{1}{C_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2}
\]

Substituting \( C_1 = 3 \, \mu\text{F} = 3 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{F} \) and \( C_2 = 6 \, \mu\text{F} = 6 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{F} \):

\[
\frac{1}{C_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{3 \times 10^{-6}} + \frac{1}{6 \times 10^{-6}} = 333,333.33 + 166,666.67 = 500,000
\]

\[
C_{\text{eq}} = \frac{1}{500,000} = 2 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{F} = 2 \, \mu\text{F}
\]

Next, the total energy stored in the equivalent capacitor is calculated using the formula:

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} C_{\text{eq}} V^2
\]

Substituting \( C_{\text{eq}} = 2 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{F} \) and \( V = 300 \, \text{V} \):

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 \times 10^{-6} \cdot (300)^2
\]

\[
U = 1 \times 10^{-6} \cdot 90,000 = 0.09 \, \text{J}
\]

To verify, the energy stored in each capacitor can also be calculated individually. Since the capacitors are in series, the charge \( Q \) on each is the same. The voltage across each capacitor can be determined using \( Q = C_1 V_1 = C_2 V_2 \), and \( V_1 + V_2 = 300 \, \text{V} \). Solving gives \( V_1 = 200 \, \text{V} \) and \( V_2 = 100 \, \text{V} \).

The energy stored in each capacitor is:

\[
U_1 = \frac{1}{2} C_1 V_1^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 3 \times 10^{-6} \cdot (200)^2 = 0.06 \, \text{J}
\]

\[
U_2 = \frac{1}{2} C_2 V_2^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6 \times 10^{-6} \cdot (100)^2 = 0.03 \, \text{J}
\]

The total energy is:

\[
U_{\text{total}} = U_1 + U_2 = 0.06 + 0.03 = 0.09 \, \text{J}
\]

Thus, the total energy stored in the two capacitors is \( 0.09 \, \text{J} \), which corresponds to option **H**.
