Okay, so I've got this logic question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about determining the validity of a type of argument based on a specific rule. The statement given is, "The minor premise must affirm the antecedent or deny the consequent." Hmm, I remember that in logic, arguments can be of different types, like syllogisms, hypotheticals, deductive, inductive, etc.

Wait, the key terms here are "minor premise," "affirm the antecedent," and "deny the consequent." I think these terms relate to conditional statements. So, in a conditional argument, which is usually in the form "If P, then Q," there are specific ways to validate the conclusion.

I recall something about modus ponens and modus tollens. Modus ponens is when you affirm the antecedent (P), and then conclude Q. Modus tollens is when you deny the consequent (not Q) and conclude not P. Both are valid forms of argument.

Now, the question is about the minor premise's role. The minor premise is usually the second premise in a syllogism. So if the syllogism is hypothetical, the minor premise would deal with either affirming or denying part of the conditional.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. 

A: Red herring argument. That's a fallacy where the argument is diverted from the issue. Not relevant here.

B: Ad hominem argument. Another fallacy where the attack is on the person, not the argument. Doesn't fit.

C: Deductive argument. This is a broad category, including syllogisms and others. The statement might apply, but let's see more specific options.

D: Categorical syllogism. These deal with categories, like "All men are mortal. Socrates is a man. Therefore, Socrates is mortal." The premises here don't involve conditionals, so probably not.

E: Disjunctive syllogism. This involves "either/or" statements. The rule about affirming or denying might not directly apply here, but I'm not certain.

F: Inductive argument. These are about probability and generalization, not the specific conditional rules mentioned.

G: Analogical argument. Draws conclusions based on similarities. Doesn't seem to fit the conditional premise rule.

H: Slippery slope argument. A fallacy where it's assumed that a small action leads to significant effects without evidence. Not directly related.

I: Hypothetical syllogism. This involves conditional statements. The structure is like if P then Q, if Q then R, so if P then R. The minor premise in such a syllogism would indeed affirm or deny part of the condition, aligning with modus ponens/tollens.

J: Toulmin model. This is about the structure of arguments with claims, data, warrants, etc. Not specifically about conditional premises.

Wait, but the question is about a minor premise. In a categorical syllogism, the minor premise refers to the specific term. But in hypothetical syllogisms, the minor premise is the one that affirms or denies. So the statement in the question is about validating hypothetical syllogisms.

So the answer would be I: Hypothetical syllogism.

The statement "The minor premise must affirm the antecedent or deny the consequent" pertains to the rules governing conditional arguments, specifically modus ponens and modus tollens. These rules are central to hypothetical syllogisms, which involve conditional statements like "If P, then Q." The minor premise in such syllogisms must either affirm the antecedent (P) or deny the consequent (not Q) to validate the conclusion. Among the options provided, hypothetical syllogism directly aligns with this reasoning.
