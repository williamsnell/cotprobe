Question:

A company sells DVD players for $200 per unit. The players have a unit variable cost of $160. The company estimates that it will sell one home entertainment system for every four DVD players sold. Home entertainment systems have a unit variable cost of $460 and sell for $600 per unit. The company's fixed costs are $90000. Assuming that the sales mix estimate is correct how many DVD players need to be sold for the company to break even?

Options:

A: 300
B: 2000
C: 500
D: 400
E: 700
F: 1200
G: 1000
H: 800
I: 600
J: 1500

Okay, so I've got this question about break-even analysis for a company selling DVD players and home entertainment systems. Hmm, break-even point is where total revenues equal total costs, right? So I need to calculate how many DVD players they need to sell to reach that point.

Let me read the question again. The company sells DVD players for $200 each, with a variable cost of $160 per unit. Then, for every four DVD players sold, they sell one home entertainment system. Those systems are sold for $600 each and have a variable cost of $460. The fixed costs are $90,000. So I need to find the number of DVD players sold to break even.

Wait, so the sales mix is 4 DVD players to 1 home system. That means for every 4 DVD, 1 system. So maybe I should consider them in batches of 5 units (4+1), but maybe not. Alternatively, I can express the sales in terms of DVD players, find the contribution per DVD and per system, then compute the total contribution needed to cover fixed costs.

Let me think. Break-even is when total contribution equals fixed costs. Contribution per unit is selling price minus variable cost.

So for DVD players:
Contribution per DVD = $200 - $160 = $40.

For home systems:
Contribution per system = $600 - $460 = $140.

But since the sales are mixed, for every 4 DVD players, one system is sold. So for each batch of 5 units (4 DVD, 1 system), the total contribution is (4 * 40) + (1 * 140) = 160 + 140 = $300.

Wait, but maybe I should model it as per unit of DVD. Like, for each DVD sold, how much system is sold. Let me see. Let's let x be the number of DVD players sold. Then, the number of systems sold is x/4.

So total revenue would be 200x + 600*(x/4). But wait, total cost is variable costs plus fixed. So total variable costs are 160x + 460*(x/4). Fixed costs are $90,000.

The break-even point is where total revenue equals total variable costs plus fixed costs.

So equation: 200x + 600*(x/4) = 160x + 460*(x/4) + 90000.

Let me compute each part step by step.

Left side (revenue):
200x + (600/4)x = 200x + 150x = 350x.

Right side (costs):
160x + (460/4)x + 90000.
460 divided by 4 is 115, so 160x + 115x = 275x. So right side is 275x + 90000.

So the equation is 350x = 275x + 90000.

Subtract 275x from both sides: 75x = 90000.

So x = 90000 / 75 = 1200.

Wait, so x is 1200. So the company needs to sell 1200 DVD players to break even.

Looking at the options, option F is 1200. So the answer should be F.

To determine the number of DVD players the company needs to sell to break even, we calculate the contribution per unit for both DVD players and home entertainment systems and account for the sales mix. 

1. **Contribution per unit**:  
   - DVD player: \( \text{Contribution} = \$200 - \$160 = \$40 \).  
   - Home entertainment system: \( \text{Contribution} = \$600 - \$460 = \$140 \).  

2. **Sales mix**: For every 4 DVD players sold, 1 home entertainment system is sold. Let \( x \) represent the number of DVD players sold. Then, the number of home entertainment systems sold is \( \frac{x}{4} \).  

3. **Total contribution**:  
   - From DVD players: \( 40x \).  
   - From home entertainment systems: \( 140 \cdot \frac{x}{4} = 35x \).  
   - Total contribution: \( 40x + 35x = 75x \).  

4. **Fixed costs**: The company has fixed costs of $90,000.  

5. **Break-even equation**:  
   \[
   \text{Total contribution} = \text{Fixed costs}
   \]
   \[
   75x = 90,000
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):  
   \[
   x = \frac{90,000}{75} = 1,200
   \]

Thus, the company needs to sell **1,200 DVD players** to break even.  

The correct answer is **F: 1200**.
