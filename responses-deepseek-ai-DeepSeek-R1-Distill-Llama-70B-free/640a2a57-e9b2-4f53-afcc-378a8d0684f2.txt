Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with stoichiometry, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about the volume of ammonia produced when steam is passed over calcium cyanamide. The reaction given is CaCN₂ + 3H₂O → 2NH₃ + CaCO₃. The molecular weights provided are CaCN₂ at 80 g/mol and NH₃ at 17 g/mol. The mass of CaCN₂ used is 4000 grams, and we're to find the volume at STP.

Wait, right, STP conditions. So I remember that at STP, one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters. So whatever moles of NH3 we get, multiplied by 22.4 will give the volume.

First, I think I need to calculate how many moles of CaCN₂ are in 4000 grams. The molecular weight is 80 g/mol, so moles = mass / molar mass. So 4000 g divided by 80 g/mol. Let me calculate that: 4000 /80 = 50 moles. Oh wait, no, wait: 80 times 50 is 4000, yes, so 50 moles of CaCN₂.

Now, looking at the balanced equation, the mole ratio between CaCN₂ and NH3 is 1:2. So for every mole of CaCN₂ that reacts, it produces 2 moles of NH3. So if I have 50 moles of CaCN₂, that should produce 50 * 2 = 100 moles of NH3.

Wait, but let me double-check the equation. Oh, yes, 1 CaCN₂ gives 2 NH3. So yes, correct.

So 100 moles of NH3. Now, at STP, each mole is 22.4 liters. So 100 * 22.4 = 2240 liters.

Hmm, looking at the options, option F is 2240 liters. So I think that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check all steps. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Molar mass of CaCN₂: Calcium is 40, carbon is 12, and two nitrogens are 14 each. So 40 +12 +28=80. Yep, that's correct.

Moles of CaCN₂: 4000 /80 =50, correct.

Molar ratio: 1:2, so 50 *2=100 moles NH3.

Volume: 100 *22.4 =2240. So yes, looks like F is correct.

I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the steps.

To determine the volume of ammonia (NH₃) produced when steam is passed over 4000 g of calcium cyanamide (CaCN₂) at STP, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate moles of CaCN₂**:  
   The molar mass of CaCN₂ is given as 80 g/mol.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of CaCN}_2 = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{4000}{80} = 50 \, \text{moles}.
   \]

2. **Determine moles of NH₃ produced**:  
   From the balanced reaction:  
   \[
   \text{CaCN}_2 + 3\text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow 2\text{NH}_3 + \text{CaCO}_3,  
   \]  
   the mole ratio of CaCN₂ to NH₃ is 1:2.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of NH}_3 = 50 \times 2 = 100 \, \text{moles}.
   \]

3. **Calculate the volume of NH₃ at STP**:  
   At STP, 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters.  
   \[
   \text{Volume of NH}_3 = 100 \times 22.4 = 2240 \, \text{liters}.
   \]

Thus, the volume of ammonia produced is **2240 liters**, which corresponds to option **F**.
