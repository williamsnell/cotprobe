Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the force on an alpha particle passing a gold nucleus. Hmm, I remember from my classes that this has to do with Coulomb's law. Let me think.

So, the setup is an alpha particle moving near a gold nucleus. I think both are positively charged. The distance between them is 0.00300 Å. Wait, what's an Ångström? Oh right, 1 Å is 1e-10 meters. So 0.00300 Å would be 3e-13 meters, right? Wait, no, wait. 0.00300 multiplied by 1e-10 is 3e-13? Yeah, that's correct.

Now, the charges. The alpha particle is a helium nucleus, so it has a charge of +2e. And the gold nucleus... Gold has an atomic number of 79, which is the number of protons. So its charge is +79e. Oh wait, but wait, in Coulomb's law, we use the charges in coulombs. So I need to convert these.

The elementary charge e is approximately 1.6e-19 coulombs. So for the alpha, Q1 is 2e, which is 2*(1.6e-19) = 3.2e-19 C. For the gold nucleus, Q2 is 79e, which is 79*(1.6e-19) = let's calculate that. 79 times 1.6 is... 79 * 1.6. 70*1.6 is 112, 9*1.6 is 14.4, so total 126.4. So 126.4e-19 C, or 1.264e-17 C.

Wait wait, wait, no. Let me recalculate that. 79 * 1.6e-19. Let's do 79 * 1.6 first. 70 * 1.6 is 112, 9 * 1.6 is 14.4, so 126.4 total. So the charge is 126.4e-20 C? Wait, no, because 1e-19 *79 is 7.9e-18? Wait, no, perhaps I messed up the exponents.

Wait, e is 1.6e-19 C. So 79e is 79 * 1.6e-19. So 79 *1.6 is 126.4, so 126.4e-19 C, which is 1.264e-17 C. Yeah, that's correct.

Now, Coulomb's law is F = k * |Q1 * Q2| / r². The constant k is 8.988e9 N·m²/C². So plugging the numbers in.

So Q1 is 3.2e-19 C, Q2 is 1.264e-17 C. Their product is 3.2e-19 * 1.264e-17. Let me calculate that. 3.2 * 1.264 is about 4.0448, and the exponent is 1e-36 (since 1e-19 *1e-17 is 1e-36). So the product is 4.0448e-36 C².

Now, r is 3e-13 meters. So r squared is (3e-13)^2 = 9e-26 m².

Putting it all into F: (8.988e9) * (4.0448e-36) / (9e-26). Let's compute denominator first. 9e-26.

So numerator: 8.988e9 *4.0448e-36 = let's compute 8.988 *4.0448 first. Hmm, 8 *4 is 32, 8 *0.0448 is about 0.3584, 0.988 *4 is about 3.952, 0.988 *0.0448 is about 0.0443. Wait, maybe a better approach is 8.988 *4.0448.

Wait, 8.988 *4 is 35.952, 8.988 *0.0448 is approximately 0.4026. So total is about 36.3546. So 8.988e9 *4.0448e-36 ≈ 36.3546e-27.

Wait, because 8.988e9 is 8.988 x1e9, and 4.0448e-36 is 4.0448 x1e-36. Multiply them: (8.988 *4.0448) x1e9 *1e-36 = 36.3546 x1e-27.

So the numerator is 36.3546e-27 N·m²/C² * C²? Wait, no, the units would be N·m²/C² * C² gives N·m², but then divided by m², so N.

Wait, but the denominator is 9e-26 m². So the entire expression is (36.3546e-27) / (9e-26) ) = Let's compute 36.3546e-27 /9e-26.

Wait, 36.3546e-27 is 3.63546e-26. So 3.63546e-26 /9e-26 = 3.63546 /9 = approximately 0.40405.

So the force is approximately 0.404 N. Wait, looking at the options, I see F: 0.405 N, which is very close. So maybe that's the right answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.

Let me recalculate the product of the charges:

Q1 = 2e = 2*(1.6e-19) = 3.2e-19 C.

Q2 = 79e = 79*(1.6e-19) = 126.4e-19 C = 1.264e-17 C.

Wait, wait, 79 *1.6e-19 is indeed 1.264e-17 C. So the product Q1*Q2 = 3.2e-19 *1.264e-17 = (3.2 *1.264) e^(-19-17) )= 4.0448e-36 C².

k is 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

r is 0.00300 Å = 3e-13 m. r squared is (3e-13)^2 =9e-26 m².

So F = (8.988e9) * (4.0448e-36) / (9e-26).

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 *4.0448e-36 = (8.988 *4.0448) *1e9 *1e-36 = 36.354e-27.

Divide by denominator 9e-26: 36.354e-27 /9e-26 = (36.354/9) * (1e-27 /1e-26) ) = (4.039) * (0.1) )= 0.4039 N.

Which is approximately 0.404 N. So the closest option is F: 0.405 N.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option F is 0.405 N, which matches.

But wait, another thought: Gold is a heavy nucleus. Are we considering the charge correctly? Because in reality, when an alpha particle approaches a nucleus, the charge would be the product of their charges, which we did as 2e and 79e. So that's correct.

Another thing: Maybe I should have used the exact value of e, like 1.602e-19 C? Because sometimes using more precise values can change the result a tiny bit. Let me recalculate with e=1.602e-19.

So Q1 = 2 *1.602e-19 =3.204e-19 C.

Q2 =79 *1.602e-19 = let's compute 79 *1.602. 70 *1.602 is 112.14, 9 *1.602 is 14.418, so total 126.558e-19 C =1.26558e-17 C.

Product Q1*Q2 =3.204e-19 *1.26558e-17 = (3.204 *1.26558) e^(-36) = let's compute 3.204 *1.26558.

3 *1.26558 is 3.79674, 0.204 *1.26558 is approximately 0.2583. So total around 4.055.

So 4.055e-36 C².

Then F = (8.988e9) *4.055e-36 / (9e-26).

Compute numerator:8.988e9 *4.055e-36 = (8.988 *4.055) *1e9 *1e-36 = let's compute 8.988 *4.055.

Approximately, 8*4.055 is 32.44, 0.988*4.055 is around 4.007. So total 36.447. So 36.447e-27.

Divide by 9e-26: 36.447e-27 /9e-26 = 36.447/(9) * (1e-27 /1e-26) )= 4.049 * 0.1 = 0.4049 N.

Hmm, that's 0.4049 N, which is about 0.405 N. So the option F is 0.405 N, which is a match.

But wait, another thing: I remember that sometimes in these problems, the distance is given as the closest approach, but perhaps the question is about the impact parameter or something else. Oh, no, the question says "passing at a distance of 0.00300 Å". So r is that value.

So I think F is the correct answer, 0.405 N.

To calculate the force on an alpha particle passing a gold atomic nucleus at a distance of \( 0.00300 \, \text{Å} \), we use Coulomb's law:

\[
F = k \cdot \frac{|Q_1 \cdot Q_2|}{r^2}
\]

### Step 1: Convert the distance
The distance \( r \) is given as \( 0.00300 \, \text{Å} \). Since \( 1 \, \text{Å} = 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \), we have:

\[
r = 0.00300 \cdot 10^{-10} \, \text{m} = 3.00 \cdot 10^{-13} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 2: Determine the charges
- The alpha particle has a charge of \( Q_1 = 2e \), where \( e = 1.6 \cdot 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \). Thus:

\[
Q_1 = 2 \cdot 1.6 \cdot 10^{-19} \, \text{C} = 3.2 \cdot 10^{-19} \, \text{C}.
\]

- The gold nucleus has an atomic number of 79, so its charge is \( Q_2 = 79e \). Thus:

\[
Q_2 = 79 \cdot 1.6 \cdot 10^{-19} \, \text{C} = 1.264 \cdot 10^{-17} \, \text{C}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the product of the charges
The product of the charges is:

\[
Q_1 \cdot Q_2 = (3.2 \cdot 10^{-19}) \cdot (1.264 \cdot 10^{-17}) = 4.0448 \cdot 10^{-36} \, \text{C}^2.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( r^2 \)
The square of the distance is:

\[
r^2 = (3.00 \cdot 10^{-13})^2 = 9.00 \cdot 10^{-26} \, \text{m}^2.
\]

### Step 5: Apply Coulomb's law
The Coulomb constant is \( k = 8.988 \cdot 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \). Substituting into Coulomb's law:

\[
F = \frac{(8.988 \cdot 10^9) \cdot (4.0448 \cdot 10^{-36})}{9.00 \cdot 10^{-26}}.
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
(8.988 \cdot 10^9) \cdot (4.0448 \cdot 10^{-36}) = 36.354 \cdot 10^{-27}.
\]

Now divide by the denominator:

\[
F = \frac{36.354 \cdot 10^{-27}}{9.00 \cdot 10^{-26}} = 0.404 \, \text{N}.
\]

### Step 6: Match the closest option
The calculated force is approximately \( 0.404 \, \text{N} \), which is closest to option **F: 0.405 N**.

Answer: F
