Question:

Semir rolls a six-sided die every morning to determine what he will have for breakfast. If he rolls a 1 or 2, he takes time to cook himself a big breakfast. If he rolls a 3 or larger he grabs a quick lighter breakfast. When he cooks himself a big breakfast, there is a 15% chance he will be late for school. If he has a lighter breakfast, there is a 6% chance he will be late for school. What is the probability Semir will be on time for school any given day?

Options:

A: 0.85
B: 0.1
C: 0.5
D: 0.99
E: 0.91
F: 0.94
G: 0.09
H: 0.75
I: 0.8
J: 0.21

Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

So, Semir rolls a six-sided die every morning. The outcome determines his breakfast, which in turn affects his chance of being late to school. The question is asking for the probability that he will be on time any given day.

First, let me outline the scenarios. When he rolls a 1 or 2, he cooks a big breakfast. Rolling a 3 or higher means a lighter breakfast. So, the die has six sides, right? So the probability of each outcome is 1/6.

Wait, but for the breakfast choice, it's grouped. So rolling a 1 or 2 is two outcomes, and 3-6 is four outcomes. So the probability he cooks a big breakfast is 2/6, which simplifies to 1/3. And the probability he grabs a quick breakfast is 4/6, which is 2/3.

Now, when he cooks a big breakfast, there's a 15% chance he's late. So that's 0.15 probability of being late. Conversely, the chance he's on time in that case is 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

If he has a quick breakfast, his chance of being late is 6%, so 0.06. So the chance he's on time is 1 - 0.06 = 0.94.

Wait, no. Wait. The problem is asking for the probability he is on time, so I need to calculate that correctly.

So, the total probability he's on time is the sum of two probabilities: (1) the probability he cooks a big breakfast and is on time, plus (2) the probability he has a quick breakfast and is on time.

So let's compute each part.

First part: Probability big breakfast and on time.

Probability big breakfast is 1/3. Probability on time given big breakfast is 0.85. So 1/3 * 0.85.

Second part: Probability quick breakfast and on time.

Probability quick breakfast is 2/3. Probability on time given quick breakfast is 0.94. So 2/3 * 0.94.

Wait, wait. Let me check the numbers. 1 - 0.15 is 0.85, that's correct. And 1 - 0.06 is 0.94. Yeah.

So let's compute each part numerically.

First part: (1/3) * 0.85.

1/3 is approximately 0.3333. So 0.3333 * 0.85 = let me calculate that. 0.3333 * 0.8 is about 0.2666, and 0.3333 * 0.05 is 0.016665. Adding them gives approximately 0.2833.

Second part: (2/3) * 0.94.

2/3 is about 0.6667. 0.6667 * 0.94. Let me compute this. 0.6667 * 0.9 is 0.6, 0.6667 * 0.04 is about 0.026668. So adding them gives 0.626668.

Now, summing both parts: 0.2833 + 0.6267 â‰ˆ 0.91.

Wait, because 0.2833 + 0.6267 is 0.91. So the total probability he is on time is 0.91, or 91%.

Looking at the options, option E is 0.91. So the correct answer should be E.

To determine the probability that Semir will be on time for school any given day, we analyze the two scenarios based on his breakfast choice:

1. **Big Breakfast (rolls 1 or 2):**  
   - Probability of rolling a 1 or 2: \( \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} \).  
   - Probability of being on time after a big breakfast: \( 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 \).  
   - Combined probability for this scenario: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 0.85 = 0.2833 \).

2. **Light Breakfast (rolls 3 or higher):**  
   - Probability of rolling a 3, 4, 5, or 6: \( \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \).  
   - Probability of being on time after a light breakfast: \( 1 - 0.06 = 0.94 \).  
   - Combined probability for this scenario: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 0.94 = 0.6267 \).

The total probability that Semir will be on time is the sum of the probabilities from both scenarios:  
\[
0.2833 + 0.6267 = 0.91
\]

Thus, the probability that Semir will be on time for school any given day is **0.91**.
