Okay, so I've got this problem here about a radio's price change, and I need to find the percentage markup. Hmm, let's see. The original price was $2.25, and now it's sold for $2.50. I remember that markup percentage is calculated based on the original price, not the selling price. 

Wait, so markup is the amount added to the original price, right? So first, I should find the difference between the new price and the original. Let me subtract: $2.50 minus $2.25 equals $0.25. So the markup amount is 25 cents.

Now, to find the percentage, I think the formula is (markup amount divided by original price) multiplied by 100. So that's ($0.25 / $2.25) * 100. Let me compute that. 

0.25 divided by 2.25. Hmm, 2.25 goes into 0.25 how many times? Well, 2.25 times 0.111 is about 0.25, because 2.25 * 0.1 is 0.225, and 2.25 * 0.11 is 0.2475, which is close to 0.25. So approximately 11.11%. 

Looking at the options, I see D is 11%, which is close to my calculation. Wait, but let me double-check the math. Maybe I should do it more precisely. 

So 0.25 divided by 2.25 equals... Let's write it as a fraction: 25/225. Simplifying that, both numerator and denominator are divisible by 25. 25 divided by 25 is 1, and 225 divided by 25 is 9. So it's 1/9. What's 1/9 as a percentage? 1 divided by 9 is approximately 0.1111, which is 11.11%. So that's about 11.11%, which would round to 11%. 

So the correct answer should be 11%, which is option D. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't confuse markup with markdown or anything. No, markup is when the price is increased, so yes, that's correct. The markup is based on the original price, so yes, the formula is right.

The original price of the radio was $2.25, and it was sold for $2.50. To find the markup percentage, first calculate the markup amount: 

\[
\text{Markup Amount} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Original Price} = \$2.50 - \$2.25 = \$0.25
\]

Next, use the formula for markup percentage:

\[
\text{Markup Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Markup Amount}}{\text{Original Price}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{0.25}{2.25} \right) \times 100 \approx 11.11\%
\]

Rounding to the nearest whole number gives approximately 11%. Among the options provided, the closest match is 11%, which corresponds to option D.
