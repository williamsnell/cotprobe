Okay, so I've got this differential equation problem here. Let me see what it's about. The equation is dy/dt equals the square root of t, and the initial condition is y(1) equals 1. I need to find y(4). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my calculus, but let's try to work through this step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with a differential equation like dy/dt equals some function of t, the solution involves integrating both sides. So I think I should integrate dy/dt = sqrt(t) with respect to t.

Wait, right. The equation is dy/dt = sqrt(t). So to find y as a function of t, I need to integrate sqrt(t) dt. The integral of sqrt(t) is something I should recall. Oh yeah, sqrt(t) is t^(1/2), and the integral of t^n is (t^(n+1))/(n+1), right? So for n=1/2, that would be (t^(3/2))/(3/2) which simplifies to (2/3) t^(3/2).

So integrating both sides, the left side becomes y, and the right side is (2/3) t^(3/2) plus a constant. So y = (2/3) t^(3/2) + C.

Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When t=1, y=1. Plugging in, 1 = (2/3)(1)^(3/2) + C. Since 1^(3/2) is just 1, this becomes 1 = (2/3) + C. Solving for C, subtract 2/3 from both sides: C = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.

So the function y(t) is (2/3) t^(3/2) + 1/3.

Now, I need to find y(4). Plugging t=4 into the equation: y(4) = (2/3)*(4)^(3/2) + 1/3.

Wait, let me compute 4^(3/2). The square root of 4 is 2, and then raising that to the 3rd power, so 2^3=8. So 4^(3/2) is 8. So (2/3)*8 is 16/3. Then add 1/3: 16/3 + 1/3 = 17/3. Oh wait, 17 divided by 3 is approximately 5.666... So 5.666... which is 5.6667 when rounded to four decimal places.

Looking at the options, option G is 5.667. That seems to match. But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, another thought: sometimes when integrating, it's easy to mix up the exponents. Let me confirm the integral of t^(1/2). Yes, it's (t^(3/2))/(3/2) = (2/3) t^(3/2). That's correct.

And plugging in the initial condition: when t=1, y=1. So 1 = (2/3)(1) + C. Yes, so C=1-2/3=1/3.

So y(t) = (2/3) t^(3/2) + 1/3.

At t=4, 4^(3/2) is indeed (sqrt(4))^3=2^3=8. So (2/3)*8 is 16/3, which is 5 and 1/3. Then adding 1/3 gives 5 and 2/3, which is 5.666..., so 5.667 when rounded to three decimal places.

Looking back at the options, G is 5.667. So that's the right answer.

To solve the differential equation \( \frac{dy}{dt} = \sqrt{t} \) with the initial condition \( y(1) = 1 \), we integrate \( \sqrt{t} \) with respect to \( t \). 

1. The integral of \( \sqrt{t} = t^{1/2} \) is:
   \[
   \int t^{1/2} \, dt = \frac{t^{3/2}}{3/2} = \frac{2}{3} t^{3/2}.
   \]
   Thus, the general solution is:
   \[
   y(t) = \frac{2}{3} t^{3/2} + C,
   \]
   where \( C \) is the constant of integration.

2. Apply the initial condition \( y(1) = 1 \):
   \[
   1 = \frac{2}{3} (1)^{3/2} + C.
   \]
   Since \( (1)^{3/2} = 1 \), this simplifies to:
   \[
   1 = \frac{2}{3} + C \implies C = 1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}.
   \]

   Therefore, the specific solution is:
   \[
   y(t) = \frac{2}{3} t^{3/2} + \frac{1}{3}.
   \]

3. To find \( y(4) \), substitute \( t = 4 \) into the solution:
   \[
   y(4) = \frac{2}{3} (4)^{3/2} + \frac{1}{3}.
   \]
   Compute \( (4)^{3/2} \):
   \[
   (4)^{3/2} = (\sqrt{4})^3 = 2^3 = 8.
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   y(4) = \frac{2}{3} (8) + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{16}{3} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{17}{3}.
   \]
   Converting \( \frac{17}{3} \) to a decimal gives approximately \( 5.667 \).

4. Comparing this result to the options provided, the closest match is **G: 5.667**.
