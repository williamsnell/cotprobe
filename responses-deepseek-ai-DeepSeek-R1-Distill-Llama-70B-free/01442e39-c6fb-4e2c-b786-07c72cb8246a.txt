Alright, so I need to figure out who the WNBA's Most Valuable Player was in 1999. I'm a bit rusty on my WNBA history, but I'll try to think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the WNBA started in the late 90s, so 1999 would be one of its early seasons. I think some of the key players from that time include Lisa Leslie, Sheryl Swoopes, and Cynthia Cooper. Those names come to mind because they were really dominant in the early days of the league.

I recall that the MVP award is given annually to the best performing player. So I'll try to remember any notable performances from 1999. I think Lisa Leslie was a big star, playing for the Los Angeles Sparks. She was known for her all-around skills, and I believe she might have won the MVP at some point. But wait, was it in 1999?

Alternatively, I remember that Sheryl Swoopes was the first player to be signed to the WNBA and was a key figure, but I'm not sure if she won MVP in 1999. Then there's Cynthia Cooper, who was also a standout player, especially known for her scoring ability. I think she might have been MVP around that time, maybe in 1998 or 1999.

Let me think about the timeline. The WNBA's first season was 1997. So the early MVPs would be from those initial years. I believe Cynthia Cooper won the MVP in 1998, and maybe she also won it again in 1999. Or perhaps Lisa Leslie took it in 1999. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Another approach: looking at the options provided. The options are A through J, with J being Lisa Leslie. I know Lisa Leslie won multiple MVPs, including in the early 2000s, but I'm not certain about 1999.

Wait, I think in 1999, Lisa Leslie did win the MVP. She was an incredible player, leading the Sparks and putting up great numbers. But I'm a bit unsure because I remember Cynthia Cooper also being a dominant force around that time. Maybe she won it in 1998 and someone else in 1999.

Alternatively, perhaps it was Sheryl Swoopes who won it in 1999. But I'm not as confident about that. Another thought: Rebecca Lobo was a big name too, but I don't think she was MVP in 1999. Yolanda Griffith was also a top player, but I think she might have won Defensive Player of the Year more often.

Wait, I'm trying to recall specific awards. I think Lisa Leslie won the MVP in 1999. She was known for her dominance in the league, and that year might have been her standout season. So perhaps the answer is J: Lisa Leslie.

But wait, I'm second-guessing because I remember Cynthia Cooper having a great season in 1999 as well. Maybe she was the MVP that year. I'm a bit torn between Cooper and Leslie.

Let me think about the years. The WNBA MVP for 1997 was Sheryl Swoopes, 1998 was Cynthia Cooper, and 1999 might have been Lisa Leslie. Or maybe Cooper won it again in 1999. I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the Finals MVP as well. I know that in 1999, the Houston Comets won the championship, and Cynthia Cooper was the Finals MVP. But that doesn't necessarily mean she was the regular season MVP.

Wait, I think in 1999, the regular season MVP was indeed Lisa Leslie. She had an amazing season, averaging around 15 points and 9 rebounds, leading the Sparks. So I'll go with Lisa Leslie as the 1999 MVP.

The WNBA's Most Valuable Player of 1999 was Lisa Leslie. She had a standout season, leading the Los Angeles Sparks with impressive statistics and earning the MVP award. While other notable players like Cynthia Cooper and Sheryl Swoopes were also dominant during that era, Leslie's performance that year made her the MVP.

Answer: J
