Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this logic question about fallacies. The question is asking which fallacy occurs when a claim is supported only by asserting that unidentified experts accept it. Let me break this down.

First, I need to remember the different types of fallacies. I remember that a fallacy is an error in reasoning that makes an argument invalid, misleading, or false. The question gives me several options, from A to J, each corresponding to a specific fallacy.

The specific scenario here is when someone supports their claim by saying that unidentified experts agree with it. So, the argument is relying on the opinion of experts, but they aren't named or specified.

I think about the appeal to authority fallacy, which is when someone cites an authority to support their claim. But wait, in this case, the experts are unidentified. So it's a specific type of appeal to authority where the authority isn't named or known.

Looking at the options, option D is "appeal to anonymous authority." That sounds like it fits because the experts aren't identified. Option F is "ad vericundiam," which I think is another term for appeal to authority, but it's a more general term. So when the authority is unnamed, it's more specific.

Another option is A: snob appeal, which is about appealing to prestige or social status, not exactly about experts. B is appeal to popularity, which is about what's popular, not expert opinion. C is post hoc ergo propter hoc, which is about causation after an event. E is straw man, which is misrepresenting someone's argument. G is false dichotomy, which presents only two options when more exist. H is slippery slope, which suggests a chain reaction without evidence. I is ad hominem, attacking the person. J is appeal to tradition, relying on what's traditional.

So putting it together, the fallacy here is citing unnamed experts, which matches "appeal to anonymous authority," so the answer should be D.

The fallacy in question occurs when a claim is supported by citing unidentified experts, which is specifically known as the "appeal to anonymous authority." This is a more precise form of the appeal to authority fallacy, where the authority in question is not named or specified.

D: appeal to anonymous authority

Answer: D
