Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the derivative of z with respect to x at x=1. The function z is given by (1 + e^(-2x)) divided by (x + tan(12x)). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but I think I can handle it by using the quotient rule.

Wait, right, the quotient rule is (u’v - uv’) / v². So, I'll need to find the derivatives of the numerator and the denominator separately.

Let me denote u as the numerator: u = 1 + e^(-2x). The derivative of u with respect to x, u', should be straightforward. The derivative of 1 is 0, and the derivative of e^(-2x) is e^(-2x) multiplied by the derivative of the exponent, which is -2. So u' = -2e^(-2x).

Now for the denominator, v = x + tan(12x). The derivative of x is 1, and the derivative of tan(12x) is sec²(12x) times 12. So v' = 1 + 12 sec²(12x).

Putting it all together, the derivative z’ is (u’v - uv’) / v². So let's plug in u, u', v, and v'.

At x=1, I'll need to compute each part. Let's calculate each component step by step.

First, compute u at x=1: u = 1 + e^(-2*1) = 1 + e^(-2) ≈ 1 + 0.1353 = 1.1353.

Next, u’ at x=1: u’ = -2e^(-2) ≈ -2 * 0.1353 ≈ -0.2706.

Now, v at x=1: v = 1 + tan(12*1) = 1 + tan(12). Wait, tan(12) is in radians, right? Let me calculate that. 12 radians is a large angle, but let me compute it. Using a calculator, tan(12) is approximately tan(12) ≈ -1.5727 (I think, but I'm not sure). Let me double-check that. Oh wait, 12 radians is about 687 degrees, which is 360*1.9, so it's 360 + 327 degrees, which is in the fourth quadrant. The tangent of 12 radians would be negative because it's in the fourth quadrant. Let me get a more accurate value. Using a calculator, tan(12) ≈ -1.5727. So v = 1 + (-1.5727) ≈ -0.5727.

Wait, that's a problem because the denominator becomes negative, but maybe that's correct. I'll proceed.

Now, v’ at x=1: v’ = 1 + 12 * sec²(12*1) = 1 + 12 * [1 + tan²(12)].

Wait, because sec²θ = 1 + tan²θ. So sec²(12) = 1 + (tan(12))². Since tan(12) ≈ -1.5727, its square is positive, about (1.5727)^2 ≈ 2.470. So sec²(12) ≈ 1 + 2.470 = 3.470. Then, v’ = 1 + 12 * 3.470 = 1 + 41.64 = 42.64.

Now, putting it all into the quotient rule formula:

z’ = [u’v - uv’] / v².

Plugging in the values:

u’v = (-0.2706) * (-0.5727) ≈ 0.155.

uv’ = (1.1353) * (42.64) ≈ let's see, 1 *42.64 is 42.64, 0.1353*42.64≈5.77, so total ≈48.41.

So numerator: 0.155 - 48.41 ≈ -48.26.

Denominator: v² = (-0.5727)^2 ≈ 0.3283.

So z’ ≈ (-48.26) / 0.3283 ≈ let's compute that. 48 / 0.33 is about 145.45, but since it's negative, it's about -145.45. Wait, but let me do the actual division.

48.26 / 0.3283: Let's compute 0.3283 * 147 = approx 0.3283 * 100=32.83, *40=13.132, *7=2.3021. Adding up: 32.83 +13.132=45.962 +2.3021=48.2641. Oh, that's very close to 48.26. So 147 times 0.3283 is about 48.2641. So 48.26 / 0.3283 ≈ 147, but since the numerator was negative, it's approximately -147.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see -147. The options are A: -75.98, B: -120.45, etc. So perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, let me double-check my steps.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake computing v. Let me recalculate tan(12). Wait, 12 radians is a large angle; perhaps I should compute it accurately. Let me check using a calculator.

Wait, when I compute tan(12) in radians, 12 radians is approximately 687.549 degrees (since 1 rad ≈ 57.3 degrees, so 12*57.3 ≈ 687.6 degrees. Subtract 360*1=360, gets 327.6 degrees. 327.6 is in the fourth quadrant, where tan is negative. So tan(12) is negative.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Using a calculator, let's compute tan(12):

Using an online calculator, tan(12) ≈ -1.5727. So that part seems correct.

So v = 1 + (-1.5727) = -0.5727.

v squared is (-0.5727)^2 ≈ 0.3283, correct.

u at x=1 is 1 + e^(-2) ≈1.1353.

u’ is -2e^(-2) ≈-0.2707.

v’ is 1 + 12 * sec^2(12). Wait, sec^2(12) = 1 + tan^2(12). So tan(12)≈-1.5727, so squared is about 2.470. So sec^2(12)≈3.470. So 12 * 3.470 ≈41.64, so v’=1 +41.64=42.64. That's correct.

So numerator: u’v - uv’ = (-0.2707)(-0.5727) - (1.1353)(42.64).

Compute the first term: (-0.2707)*(-0.5727)= 0.2707 *0.5727 ≈ let's compute 0.27 *0.57 = 0.1539. More accurately, 0.2707 *0.5727 ≈ 0.155.

Second term: (1.1353)(42.64) = 1.1353 *42.64.

1 *42.64 =42.64, 0.1353 *42.64≈5.77. So total ≈42.64 +5.77=48.41.

So numerator is 0.155 -48.41≈-48.26.

Denominator is 0.3283.

So z’= -48.26 / 0.3283 ≈-147. So the approximate value is -147. But looking at the options, the closest is option G: -200.77, and option I: -250.33. Hmm, none match. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should use more accurate numbers. Because maybe when I approximated, I lost some precision.

Let me redo some calculations with more precise values.

First, compute e^(-2x) at x=1: e^(-2) ≈0.135335283.

So u = 1 + 0.135335283 ≈1.135335283.

u’= -2e^(-2)≈-2 *0.135335283≈-0.270670566.

Now, compute v = x + tan(12x) at x=1: 1 + tan(12). Let me compute tan(12) accurately.

Using a calculator, 12 radians is 12 * (180/pi) ≈687.549 degrees. Subtract 360*1=360, 687.549-360=327.549 degrees, which is in the fourth quadrant. The reference angle is 360 -327.549=32.451 degrees. So tan(327.549)=tan(32.451) negative. So tan(12)=tan(327.549 degrees)= -tan(32.451). Let me compute tan(32.451). 32 degrees is about 0.6249, 32.45 is slightly higher. Alternatively, perhaps better to compute using a calculator.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute tan(12 radians) accurately. Let me check an online calculator for tan(12). According to calculation, tan(12) ≈-1.57273965.

So v =1 + (-1.57273965) = -0.57273965.

v squared is (-0.57273965)^2=0.328317.

Now, v’ is 1 +12 * sec^2(12). Compute sec^2(12)=1 + tan^2(12)=1 + ( (-1.57273965)^2 )=1 + 2.4721307≈3.4721307.

So v’=1 +12 *3.4721307≈1 +41.655565≈42.655565.

Now, compute u’v: (-0.270670566)*(-0.57273965)=0.270670566 *0.57273965≈0.15506.

Compute uv’=1.135335283 *42.655565≈1.135335283 *42.655565.

Let me compute this more accurately.

1.135335283 *42.655565:

1*42.655565=42.655565.

0.135335283 *42.655565≈

Compute 0.1 *42.655565=4.2655565

0.035335283 *42.655565≈

First, 0.03 *42.655565≈1.27966695

0.005335283 *42.655565≈0.2277.

So 4.2655565 +1.27966695≈5.54522345 +0.2277≈5.77292345.

So total uv’≈42.655565 +5.77292345≈48.42848845.

So numerator is u’v - uv’=0.15506 -48.42848845≈-48.2734284.

Denominator v²=0.328317.

So z’= (-48.2734284)/0.328317 ≈-147.1.

Wait, but the options don't have -147. Let me look again.

Options:

A: -75.98

B: -120.45

C:50

D:75.32

E:100.25

F:0.5

G:-200.77

H:0

I:-250.33

J:-153.59

Hmm, option J is -153.59, which is close to my approximate -147. Let me check if perhaps I made a mistake in calculations. Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Wait, perhaps the exact computation would yield a value closer to -153.59.

Wait, let me compute numerator: u'v -uv' = (-0.270670566)(-0.57273965) - (1.135335283)(42.655565).

Compute each term precisely.

First term: (-0.270670566)*(-0.57273965)=0.270670566 * 0.57273965.

Let me compute 0.270670566 * 0.57273965.

0.270670566 *0.5 =0.135335283.

0.270670566 *0.07273965≈ let me compute that.

0.270670566 *0.07=0.01894694.

0.270670566 *0.00273965≈approx 0.0007415.

So total first term: 0.135335283 +0.01894694≈0.154282223 +0.0007415≈0.15502372.

Second term: 1.135335283 *42.655565.

Let me compute this precisely:

1.135335283 * 42.655565.

Let me break it down:

42.655565 * 1 =42.655565

42.655565 *0.135335283.

Compute 42.655565 *0.1=4.2655565

42.655565 *0.03=1.27966695

42.655565 *0.005335283≈0.2277.

So 4.2655565 +1.27966695=5.54522345 +0.2277≈5.77292345.

So total is 42.655565 +5.77292345≈48.42848845.

So numerator: 0.15502372 -48.42848845≈-48.27346475.

Denominator:0.328317.

So now, compute -48.27346475 / 0.328317.

Let me do this division accurately.

Compute 48.27346475 / 0.328317.

0.328317 *147 = ?

0.328317 *100=32.8317

0.328317 *40=13.13268

0.328317 *7=2.298219

Adding these: 32.8317 +13.13268=45.96438 +2.298219=48.2626.

So 0.328317 *147≈48.2626.

But our numerator is 48.27346475, which is 48.27346475 -48.2626=0.01086475 more.

So, 0.01086475 /0.328317 ≈0.03307.

So total division is 147.03307. Since numerator is negative, it's -147.033.

So approximately -147.03. So closest option is J: -153.59, which is a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing tan(12). Alternatively, let me check if I used the correct formula.

Wait, the function is z = (1 + e^{-2x}) / (x + tan(12x)). So when taking the derivative, I correctly applied the quotient rule.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating v’ as 1 +12 sec²(12x). Let me confirm that.

Yes, derivative of tan(u) is sec²(u) * u', so for tan(12x), the derivative is 12 sec²(12x). So v’ is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I have the correct sign for v. Wait, at x=1, v = 1 + tan(12) ≈1 -1.5727≈-0.5727, correct.

Hmm, but according to my calculation, the derivative is about -147, but the options don't have that. The closest is option J: -153.59. Maybe I should check the calculation again.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator's calculation. Let me recalculate v^2.

v is -0.57273965, so v squared is positive: (-0.57273965)^2 = 0.57273965^2.

Compute 0.57273965 *0.57273965:

Approximately, 0.5^2=0.25, 0.07^2=0.0049, cross terms: 2*(0.5)(0.07273965)=0.07273965. So 0.25 +0.07273965 +0.0049≈0.3276, which is about 0.3283, correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

0.57273965 * 0.57273965:

Let me compute 57273965 *57273965, but that's too tedious. Alternatively, perhaps using (a+b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b². Let me break 0.57273965 into 0.5 +0.07273965.

(0.5 +0.07273965)^2 = 0.25 + 2*(0.5)*(0.07273965) + (0.07273965)^2.

Compute each term:

0.25.

2*(0.5)*(0.07273965)= 0.07273965.

(0.07273965)^2≈0.0052903.

So total: 0.25 +0.07273965=0.32273965 +0.0052903≈0.32803, which is close to 0.328317. So accurate enough.

So denominator is correct.

Perhaps I made a mistake in u’v - uv’ calculation. Let me do that more accurately.

u’v = (-0.270670566)*(-0.57273965)=0.270670566 *0.57273965.

Compute 0.270670566 *0.57273965.

Let me compute 0.270670566 *0.5=0.135335283.

0.270670566 *0.07273965.

Compute 0.270670566 *0.07=0.01894694.

0.270670566 *0.00273965≈0.000741.

So total for 0.07273965: 0.01894694 +0.000741≈0.01968794.

So u’v=0.135335283 +0.01968794≈0.155023223.

uv’=1.135335283 *42.655565=48.428488.

So numerator: 0.155023223 -48.428488≈-48.2734648.

Denominator: 0.328317.

So -48.2734648 /0.328317.

Compute 48.2734648 /0.
