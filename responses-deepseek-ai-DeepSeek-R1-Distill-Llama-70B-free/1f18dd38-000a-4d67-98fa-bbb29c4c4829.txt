Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a camera photographing a sodium lamp. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my physics, but let's try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says the lamp is 120-W, and it's 100 meters away. The camera's exposure is 1/100th of a second, and the aperture diameter is 4 cm. We need to find out how many photons enter the camera during that exposure. Oh, and the wavelength is given as 5893 Å (angstroms), which I think I need to convert into meters.

Wait, the first thing I remember is that power is energy per unit time. So the lamp's power is 120 W, which is 120 Joules per second. But since the exposure time is 1/100 s, the energy emitted during that time would be power multiplied by time. Let me write that down: Energy (E) = Power (P) * time (t). So E = 120 J/s * 0.01 s = 1.2 Joules. So the lamp emits 1.2 J in that time.

But wait, that's the total energy emitted. But the camera is 100 meters away. So we need to find out how much of that energy actually reaches the camera. Because the light spreads out, right? So the energy is spread over a sphere with a radius of 100 m.

The surface area of a sphere is 4πr². So the area is 4 * π * (100)^2. Let me calculate that: 4 * π * 10,000 = 40,000π m². Approximately, π is about 3.1416, so 40,000 * 3.1416 ≈ 125,664 m².

So the total energy emitted is 1.2 J, and the energy per unit area (the intensity) at 100 m would be E divided by area. So intensity I = E / area = 1.2 J / 125,664 m² ≈ 0.00955 J/m². Wait, but wait, that's the energy per square meter. But the camera's aperture is a certain area, so the energy that enters the camera is I multiplied by the aperture area.

The aperture diameter is 4 cm, so radius is 2 cm, which is 0.02 m. The area of the aperture is πr² = π*(0.02)^2 = π*0.0004 ≈ 0.0012567 m².

So the energy entering the camera is I * area ≈ 0.00955 J/m² * 0.0012567 m² ≈ let's compute that. 0.00955 * 0.0012567 ≈ 1.20e-5 J. Hmm, that's 1.2e-5 Joules.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the initial steps. Let me double-check. Oh wait, no, the 1.2 J is the energy emitted by the lamp in 1/100th of a second. So that's correct.

Now, each photon carries energy. The energy of a single photon is given by E_photon = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

Let me plug in the numbers. h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, c is 3e8 m/s, and λ is 5893 Å. Oh wait, converting angstroms to meters: 1 Å = 1e-10 m, so 5893 Å = 5893e-10 m = 5.893e-7 m.

So E_photon = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (3e8 m/s) / (5.893e-7 m) 

Let me compute the numerator first: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide that by 5.893e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 5.893e-7 ≈ 3.37e-19 J per photon.

So each photon has about 3.37e-19 J.

Now, the total energy entering the camera is 1.2e-5 J. So the number of photons is total energy divided by energy per photon.

Number of photons N = 1.2e-5 J / 3.37e-19 J/photon ≈ let's compute that. 1.2e-5 / 3.37e-19 = approximately 3.56e13 photons. Wait, that's 3.56e13. Wait, but looking at the options, the highest I see is 1.02e11. Hmm, I must have made a mistake.

Wait a second, let me go back. Did I compute the intensity correctly? Let me double-check.

The lamp emits 120 W, which is 120 J/s. Exposure time is 1/100 s, so energy emitted is 120 * 0.01 = 1.2 J. That's correct.

The surface area at 100 m is a sphere with radius 100 m. So area is 4πr² = 4 * π * (100)^2 = 4 * π * 10,000 = 40,000π ≈ 125,663.7 m².

Intensity I = E / area = 1.2 / 125,663.7 ≈ 0.00955 J/m². That's correct.

Camera aperture area: radius 0.02 m. Area = π*(0.02)^2 = π*0.0004 ≈ 0.0012567 m².

So energy entering camera: I * area = 0.00955 * 0.0012567 ≈ 1.2e-5 J. Wait, but 0.00955 * 0.0012567 equals approximately 1.2e-5? Let me compute 0.00955 * 0.0012567.

0.00955 * 0.0012567 = (9.55e-3) * (1.2567e-3) = 9.55 * 1.2567e-6 ≈ let's compute 9.55 * 1.2567.

9 * 1.2567 = 11.3103, 0.55 *1.2567≈0.690, so total ≈11.3103+0.690≈12.0003e-6 → 1.20003e-5 J. So that's correct.

Then each photon's energy: hc/λ.

h=6.626e-34, c=3e8, λ=5.893e-7 m.

So 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25.

Divide by 5.893e-7: 1.9878e-25 / 5.893e-7 = 3.37e-19 J per photon.

So number of photons N = 1.2e-5 / 3.37e-19 = (1.2 / 3.37) * 1e14 → 0.356 * 1e14 → 3.56e13.

Wait, that's 3.56e13 photons. But looking at the options, the highest is 1.02e11, which is way lower. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me think again. Oh wait, the power is 120 W, but that's the total power emitted in all directions. So the energy emitted in 1/100 s is 120 * 0.01 = 1.2 J. So that's correct.

But wait, what if the lamp emits light in all directions, so the intensity at the camera is I = P/(4πr²), but wait, no, because the power is emitted over time. Let me think: Power is energy per time, so the intensity is power per area. So I = P / (4πr²) → yes, that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should compute it differently. Let me think: the power is 120 W, so in one second, 120 J is emitted. The intensity at 100 m is P/(4πr²) = 120 / (4π*(100)^2) → 120/(4*π*10000) → 120 / (40000π) ≈ 120 / 125663.7 ≈ 0.000955 J/(s·m²). 

So the intensity is 0.000955 J/(s·m²). Now, during the exposure time of 0.01 s, the energy per area is I * t = 0.000955 * 0.01 = 0.00000955 J/m².

Wait, earlier I had 0.00955 J/m², because I thought E = P*t. So that's where I might have messed up. Because if I use P for intensity calculation, I should calculate I as P/(4πr²) → units of W/m².

Wait, so let's try that approach.

So, correct approach: the intensity I is power per unit area, so I = P / (4πr²), and that's in W/m², which is J/(s·m²).

So I = 120 W / (4π*(100)^2) → 120/(4*π*10000) → 120/(40000π) → 120/(125663.7) ≈ 0.000955 J/(s·m²).

Now, the exposure time is 0.01 s, so the energy per unit area is I * t → 0.000955 * 0.01 = 0.00000955 J/m² → 9.55e-6 J/m².

Ah, so earlier I had 0.00955 J/m², which was wrong. It should be 9.55e-6 J/m².

Then, the energy entering the camera is I*t * area.

Area of the aperture is π*(0.02)^2 = 0.0012567 m².

So energy E = 9.55e-6 J/m² * 0.0012567 m² → 9.55e-6 * 0.0012567 ≈ (9.55 * 1.2567) e-9 → approximately 12e-9 J → 1.2e-8 J.

Wait, let me compute 9.55e-6 * 0.0012567:

9.55e-6 = 0.00000955

0.00000955 * 0.0012567 = ?

Multiply 9.55e-6 by 1.2567e-3: 9.55 * 1.2567 = approx 12. So 12e-9 → 1.2e-8 J.

Now, the energy per photon is still 3.37e-19 J.

So the number of photons N = 1.2e-8 J / 3.37e-19 J/photon → (1.2 / 3.37) * 1e11 → approximately 0.356 * 1e11 → 3.56e10 photons. So about 3.56e10 photons.

Looking at the options: option G is 3.55e10, which is very close to my result. So I think the correct answer is G.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any other mistakes. Let me recalculate the intensity:

I = P/(4πr²) = 120 / (4 * π * 100^2) → 120 / (4 * π * 10,000) = 120 / (40,000 * π) → 120 / 125,663.7 ≈ 0.000955 J/(s·m²).

Exposure time t=0.01 s, so energy per m² is I*t = 0.000955 * 0.01 = 0.00000955 J/m².

Aperture area A = π*(0.02)^2 = π*0.0004 ≈ 0.0012567 m².

Energy E = I*t * A = 0.00000955 * 0.0012567 ≈ 1.2e-8 J.

Photon energy E_photon = hc/λ = (6.626e-34)(3e8)/(5.893e-7) = (1.9878e-25)/(5.893e-7) ≈ 3.37e-19 J.

Number of photons N = E / E_photon = 1.2e-8 / 3.37e-19 ≈ 3.56e10.

Yes, that's correct. So the closest option is G: 3.55 × 10^10.

To determine how many photons enter the camera during the exposure, we proceed as follows:

1. **Energy Emitted by the Lamp**:  
   The lamp's power is 120 W, and the exposure time is \( t = 0.01 \, \text{s} \). The total energy emitted by the lamp during this time is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{total}} = P \cdot t = 120 \, \text{J/s} \cdot 0.01 \, \text{s} = 1.2 \, \text{J}.
   \]

2. **Intensity at 100 m**:  
   The light spreads out over the surface of a sphere with radius \( r = 100 \, \text{m} \). The surface area of the sphere is:  
   \[
   A_{\text{sphere}} = 4 \pi r^2 = 4 \pi (100)^2 = 40,000 \pi \, \text{m}^2 \approx 125,664 \, \text{m}^2.
   \]  
   The intensity at 100 m is the energy per unit area:  
   \[
   I = \frac{E_{\text{total}}}{A_{\text{sphere}}} = \frac{1.2}{125,664} \approx 0.00000955 \, \text{J/m}^2.
   \]

3. **Energy Entering the Camera**:  
   The camera's aperture has a diameter of \( 4 \, \text{cm} \), so its radius is \( 2 \, \text{cm} = 0.02 \, \text{m} \). The area of the aperture is:  
   \[
   A_{\text{aperture}} = \pi r^2 = \pi (0.02)^2 = \pi (0.0004) \approx 0.0012567 \, \text{m}^2.
   \]  
   The energy entering the camera is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{camera}} = I \cdot A_{\text{aperture}} = 0.00000955 \cdot 0.0012567 \approx 1.2 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{J}.
   \]

4. **Energy of a Single Photon**:  
   The energy of a single photon is given by \( E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \lambda = 5893 \, \text{Å} = 5.893 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \).  
   \[
   E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{5.893 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 3.37 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]

5. **Number of Photons**:  
   The number of photons entering the camera is the total energy divided by the energy per photon:  
   \[
   N = \frac{E_{\text{camera}}}{E_{\text{photon}}} = \frac{1.2 \times 10^{-8}}{3.37 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.56 \times 10^{10}.
   \]

6. **Closest Option**:  
   The closest option to \( 3.56 \times 10^{10} \) is **G: \( 3.55 \times 10^{10} \)**.

Answer: G
