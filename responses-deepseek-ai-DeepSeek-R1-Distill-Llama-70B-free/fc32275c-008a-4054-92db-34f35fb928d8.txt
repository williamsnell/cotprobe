Okay, so I've got this problem here with three parts, a, b, and c, and I need to calculate each one and match the results to the given options. The options are labeled A to J, each providing answers for all three parts. Hmm, let's tackle each part one by one.

Starting with part a: 3652_8 multiplied by 24_8. Oh wait, both numbers are in octal, so base 8. I remember that multiplying in another base can be tricky, but maybe converting them to decimal, doing the math, and then converting back to octal would be easier.

First, let's convert 3652_8 to decimal. Each digit represents a power of 8. So from right to left, the digits are 2,5,6,3. Calculating:

3 * 8^3 = 3 * 512 = 1536
6 * 8^2 = 6 * 64 = 384
5 * 8^1 = 40
2 * 8^0 = 2
Adding them up: 1536 + 384 = 1920; 1920 +40=1960; 1960+2=1962. So 3652_8 is 1962 in decimal.

Next, 24_8 to decimal. 4*8^0=4, 2*8^1=16. Total is 20.

Now multiply 1962 by 20. That's 39240 in decimal.

Now convert 39240 back to octal. How do I do that? Divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

39240 ÷8 = 4905, rem 0
4905 ÷8 = 613, rem 5
613 ÷8 = 76, rem 5
76 ÷8 =9, rem4
9 ÷8=1, rem1
1 ÷8=0, rem1.

Reading the remainders from bottom up: 1 1 4 5 5 0. So 114550_8.

Wait, let me double-check that. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the division steps. Let me try another way. 8^5 is 32768. 39240 ÷32768 is 1, remainder 6472. Then 6472 ÷4096 (8^4)=1, remainder 2376. 2376 ÷512 (8^3)=4, remainder 404. 404 ÷64 (8^2)=6, remainder 20. 20 ÷8=2, rem4. So the octal digits are 1 1 4 6 2 4. So 114624_8? Wait, this conflicts with my earlier result. Hmm, maybe I messed up the initial division.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe a better approach is to write it step by step.

Wait, 8^5 is 32768. 39240 ÷32768 is 1, remainder 39240-32768=6472.

Now 6472 ÷ 4096 (8^4) is 1, remainder 6472-4096=2376.

2376 ÷ 512 (8^3) is 4 (512*4=2048), remainder 2376-2048=328.

328 ÷64 (8^2)=5 (64*5=320), remainder 8.

8 ÷8=1, remainder 0. So now, the digits from highest to lowest:

1 (8^5), 1 (8^4), 4 (8^3), 5 (8^2), 1 (8^1), 0 (8^0). So that would be 114510_8? Wait, but 114510 in octal is 1*8^5 +1*8^4 +4*8^3 +5*8^2 +1*8 +0.

Wait, let's calculate that back to decimal to confirm:

1*32768=32768
1*8192=8192
4*512=2048
5*64=320
1*8=8
0*1=0
Adding: 32768+8192=40960; +2048=43008; +320=43328; +8=43336. Oh wait, but 1962*20=39240, which is less than 43336. So I must have made a mistake in my conversion.

Hmm, maybe I should try a different method. Let's divide 39240 by 8 step by step:

39240 ÷8 = 4905, remainder 0
4905 ÷8 = 613, rem 5
613 ÷8=76, rem 5 (since 76*8=608; 613-608=5)
76 ÷8=9, rem 4 (9*8=72;76-72=4)
9 ÷8=1, rem1
1 ÷8=0, rem1.

So the remainders, read from last to first, are 1 1 4 5 5 0. So 114550_8.

Wait, but 114550 in octal is 1*8^5 +1*8^4 +4*8^3 +5*8^2 +5*8 +0.

Calculating that: 1*32768=32768, 1*8192=8192, 4*512=2048, 5*64=320, 5*8=40.

Adding: 32768 +8192=40960, +2048=43008, +320=43328, +40=43368. Hmm, but 39240 is less than that. So I must have made a mistake in my conversion.

Wait, perhaps I should try a different approach. Let me calculate 8^5 =32768, 8^6=262144 which is larger than 39240. So the highest power is 8^5.

39240 ÷32768=1, remainder 39240-32768=6472.

Now 6472 ÷8^4 (4096) is 1, rem 6472-4096=2376.

2376 ÷8^3 (512)=4, rem 2376-2048=328.

328 ÷8^2 (64)=5, rem 328-320=8.

8 ÷8^1=1, rem 0.

So the octal digits are 1 1 4 5 1 0 → 114510_8.

Wait, but earlier when I did the step-by-step division, I got 114550. Now I'm getting 114510. So perhaps I made a mistake in my initial step-by-step division steps. Let me try that again.

39240 ÷8: Let's see, 8 × 4905 = 39240, so remainder 0.

4905 ÷8: 8 ×613=4904, so rem 1.

613 ÷8: 8 ×76=608, rem5.

76 ÷8:9×8=72, rem4.

9 ÷8:1×8=8, rem1.

1 ÷8:0, rem1.

So reading remainders from last to first: 1 1 4 5 1 0 → 114510_8.

So yes, 114510_8. Let me check what 114510_8 is in decimal.

1*8^5 = 32768
1*8^4=8192
4*8^3=4*512=2048
5*8^2=5*64=320
1*8^1=8
0*1=0.

Adding: 32768+8192=40960; +2048=43008; +320=43328; +8=43336. Wait, but 1962 *20 is 39240, which is not 43336. So something's wrong here. Oh wait, no. Because 3652_8 is 1962, 24_8 is 20. 1962*20=39240. But converting 39240 to octal gives 114510, which is 1*32768 + 1*8192 +4*512 +5*64 +1*8 +0 → 32768+8192=40960; 4*512=2048; 40960+2048=43008; 5*64=320 → 43328; +8 →43336. That's way bigger than 39240, so I must have messed up the conversion.

Hmm, maybe I should try a different approach. Let me calculate 39240 /8 = 4905 rem 0.

4905 /8 = 613 rem 1 (since 613 *8=4904; 4905-4904=1).

613 /8=76 rem 1 (76*8=608; 613-608=5? Wait, 76*8 is 608, so 613-608=5. So remainder is 5, not 1. Oh! I see, I made a mistake in the step.

Wait, 613 ÷8: 8*76=608, which is less than 613. So 613-608=5, so remainder is 5. So the second digit (from the right) is 5, not 1.

Continuing:

76 ÷8=9 rem4.

9 ÷8=1 rem1.

1 ÷8=0 rem1.

So the remainders from last to first are 1 (from 1/8), 1 (from 9/8), 4 (76/8), 5 (613/8), 1 (4905/8), 0 (39240/8). So the octal number is 1 1 4 5 1 0 → 114510_8.

Wait, but 114510_8 is 43336 in decimal, which doesn't match 39240. So I'm definitely making a mistake here. Maybe I should use a different method. Let's try subtracting powers of 8.

Let me see:

The number is 39240 in decimal.

What's the largest power of 8 less than 39240?

8^0 =1, 8^1=8, 8^2=64, 8^3=512, 8^4=4096, 8^5=32768, 8^6=262144 which is too big.

So start with 8^5=32768.

How many times does 32768 go into 39240? Once (1×32768=32768). Subtract: 39240-32768=6472.

Next is 8^4=4096. How many times does 4096 go into 6472? Once (1×4096=4096). Subtract: 6472-4096=2376.

Next is 8^3=512. 2376 ÷512=4. So 4×512=2048. Subtract: 2376-2048=328.

Next is 8^2=64. 328 ÷64=5. So 5×64=320. Subtract: 328-320=8.

Next is 8^1=8. 8 ÷8=1. Subtract: 0.

So the coefficients are:

8^5:1, 8^4:1, 8^3:4, 8^2:5, 8^1:1, 8^0:0.

So the octal number is 114510_8. But wait, converting that back gives 43336, which is more than 39240. So I'm definitely doing something wrong here. Maybe the initial conversion was incorrect. Let me double-check the multiplication.

Wait, 3652_8 is 3*512=1536, 6*64=384 (1536+384=1920), 5*8=40 (1920+40=1960), 2*1=2 → 1962.

24_8 is 2*8=16 +4=20. 1962 *20=39240. That's correct.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the conversion. Maybe I should try to find 39240 in octal correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use another method: write 39240 in binary and then group into 3 bits.

Wait, let's convert 39240 to binary.

But that might take longer. Alternatively, perhaps I should just accept that I'm making a mistake in the conversion and try to find which option matches.

Looking at the options, part a in each option is:

A:235761_8

B:305214_8

C:172340_8

D:987654_8

E:451236_8

F:123456_8

G:731642_8

H:114510_8

I:654321_8

J:146253_8

So the result I got is 114510_8, which matches option H's part a: 114510_8.

Wait, but earlier when I thought I was getting 114550, which isn't any of the options, but now after correcting, I get 114510, which is option H's a.

But wait, I thought the correct conversion was 114510, which is option H, but let me double-check: 114510_8 is 1*32768 +1*8192 +4*512 +5*64 +1*8 +0 = 32768 +8192=40960; +2048=43008; +320=43328; +8=43336. But 39240 is less than that. So something's wrong here.

Wait, maybe I did the multiplication wrong. Let me recalculate 3652_8 × 24_8.

Alternatively, perhaps I should perform the multiplication directly in octal without converting.

3652_8 ×24_8.

Let me write it down in octal multiplication:

    3652_8
  ×   24_8
  ----------

First, multiply 3652 by 4_8. 4 in octal is 4 in decimal.

2 ×4 =8 → in octal, 8 is 10. So write 0, carryover 1.

5 ×4=20 → 20 in octal is 24 (since 2×8=16, 20-16=4). So 4, plus carryover 1 →5. So write 5, carryover 0.

6 ×4=24 → 24 in octal is 30 (3×8=24). So write 0, carryover 3.

3 ×4=12 →12 in octal is 14 (1×8=8, 12-8=4). So 4 + carryover 3 →7, carryover 0.

So first partial product is 7050_8.

Wait, wait, let me write it correctly:

3652 ×4:

Starting from the right:

2 ×4 =8 → 10_8 → 0 with carryover1.

5 ×4=20 → 24_8 →4, carryover2? Wait, no, 20 in decimal is 24 in octal? Wait, 2×8=16, 20-16=4, so yes, 24 in octal. So 4, carryover 2? Wait, no: 5 ×4=20 (decimal). 20 ÷8 is 2, remainder 4. So it's 24_8, so digit is 4, carryover 2.

Then 6 ×4=24 (decimal). 24 ÷8=3, rem 0 → 30_8. So digit 0, carryover 3. But we have the previous carryover of 2, so 3+2=5? Wait, no, in multiplication, each digit is multiplied, and carryover is added to the next digit's product.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating. Let me do it step by step.

Multiplying 3652_8 by 4_8:

- 2 ×4 = 8 → in octal, 10. So write 0, carryover 1.
- 5 ×4 =20 → 24 in octal. So write 4, carryover 2.
- 6 ×4 =24 → 30 in octal. So write 0, carryover 3.
- 3 ×4 =12 → 14 in octal (since 12=8+4). So write 4, carryover1.

Then, after 3 ×4, we add the carryover1, so it becomes 4 +1=5. So the partial product is 5 0 4 0 → 5040_8? Wait, no, the digits are written in order, so it's 5 (leftmost), then 0, 4, 0. So 5040_8.

Wait, but earlier when I converted to decimal, the result was 1962 ×20=39240, which in octal is supposed to be 114510_8, which is option H's a. But when doing octal multiplication, I get 5040_8 as the first partial product.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because 3652_8 ×4_8 is 3652 ×4 in octal, which is 3652_8 × 4_8 = ?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try the second part of the multiplication: 3652_8 × 24_8 is the same as 3652_8 × (20_8 +4_8) = 3652_8 ×4_8 shifted one position plus 3652_8 ×20_8.

Wait, maybe it's easier to break it down as 3652_8 × 24_8 = 3652_8 × (2×8^1 +4×8^0) = 3652_8 ×2×8 + 3652_8 ×4.

But perhaps I should proceed step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just accept that my initial conversion to decimal is correct, and that the octal result is 114510_8, which is option H's a. So part a is H's 114510_8.

Moving on to part b: 11.01_2 × 1.01_2.

These are binary numbers. Multiplying in binary. Let me convert them to decimal, multiply, then convert back.

11.01_2 is equal to:

The integer part: 1×2^1 +1×2^0 =2+1=3.

The fractional part: 0×2^-1 +1×2^-2 →
