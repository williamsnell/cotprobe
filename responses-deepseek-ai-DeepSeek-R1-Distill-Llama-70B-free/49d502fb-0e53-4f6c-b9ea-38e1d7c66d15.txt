The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A dance student worked very hard to strengthen her legs, including performing additional activities such as leaping and bounding up multiple flights of stairs in her apartment building. While she was performing her exercises, one of the janitors in the building warned her that "she was bound to get hurt if she keeps it up, because there are problems with the floor." After falling and breaking a leg due to a loose floorboard, she brought suit against the building owner. The building owner wants to testify that: "The janitor told me 'I told her that running too fast is dangerous and she was bound to get hurt.' ". Is the building owner's statement likely to be held admissible?

Options:

A: No, because it is hearsay, the janitor's statement is not a public record.
B: Yes, because it is an exception to hearsay as a recorded recollection.
C: Yes, because it is an exception to hearsay as a statement made for medical diagnosis or treatment.
D: Yes, because it is as an exception to hearsay as a spontaneous declaration to an opponent-party.
E: No, because it is hearsay and the building owner is not a credible source.
F: Yes, because it is an exception to hearsay as a statement of then-existing mental, emotional, or physical condition.
G: No, because it is hearsay within hearsay, and there are no hearsay exceptions that apply.
H: Yes, because the building owner can testify and be questioned about what the janitor told him.
I: No, because it is irrelevant and immaterial.
J: No, because it is hearsay and there are no exceptions that would allow for the janitor's statement to be admissible.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically hearsay exceptions. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The scenario is about a dance student who was doing intense exercises, like leaping and bounding up stairs. A janitor warned her that she was bound to get hurt because of problems with the floor. Then she fell because of a loose floorboard and broke her leg. She's suing the building owner, and now the building owner wants to testify about what the janitor told him. The statement is: "I told her that running too fast is dangerous and she was bound to get hurt."

So the question is whether the building owner's statement is admissible. The options are A through J, each giving a different reason based on hearsay rules.

First, I need to recall what hearsay is. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. If the building owner is testifying about what the janitor told him, that's an out-of-court statement (unless the janitor is testifying now, but I don't think that's the case here).

So, the building owner's statement would be hearsay if it's being offered for the truth—that the janitor did warn her, which might relate to the building owner's knowledge or the student's negligence.

Wait, but the building owner is testifying about what the janitor said to him. So the statement is being offered to show that the janitor communicated a warning, perhaps to indicate that the building owner had knowledge of the dangerous condition. Or maybe to show that the student was warned, which could relate to assumption of risk or contributory negligence.

But the key is whether this statement falls under a hearsay exception. Let's look at the options.

Option A says it's not admissible because it's hearsay and not a public record. Public records are an exception under FRE 803(8), but I don't think the janitor's statement qualifies as a public record. So that might be a consideration, but the option is saying it's inadmissible because it's not a public record. Wait, but the building owner's statement is about what the janitor told him. The janitor's statement would be hearsay, but maybe it falls under another exception.

Option B says it's admissible as a recorded recollection. Recorded recollection under FRE 803(5) requires that the witness made the record when the event was fresh and has no present memory. But here, the building owner is just testifying about what the janitor said, not referring to a record. So B doesn't seem right.

Option C: Exception for medical diagnosis or treatment. That's FRE 803(4). The statement here is about a warning, not related to medical treatment, so C is out.

Option D: Spontaneous declaration to an opponent-party. Spontaneous declarations are under FRE 803(2)—excited utterance. But for that, the statement must be made under stress of the event. Also, the statement is made by the janitor to the building owner. Wait, but the building owner is the opponent in the lawsuit. So if the janitor made a statement to the building owner, perhaps that could qualify as a statement by a party opponent under FRE 801(d)(2). Wait, but the building owner is the one testifying, and the statement is from the janitor, who is an employee, perhaps. So maybe it's a vicarious admission by a party opponent.

Wait, no. The building owner is testifying about the janitor's statement. If the janitor is an employee of the building owner, then under the admissions by a party opponent exception, statements by the party's employees concerning a matter within their authority and during the employment relationship are admissible. So the janitor's statement to the building owner would be an admission by a party opponent, making it non-hearsay under 801(d)(2)(D). So that would make the statement admissible as non-hearsay, not needing an exception.

But wait, the option D says it's a spontaneous declaration to an opponent-party. I'm not sure that's accurate. Spontaneous declarations are a different exception. Alternatively, perhaps it's an admission under 801(d)(2). So if the building owner is testifying to the janitor's statement, and the janitor is his employee, then it's an admission, so not hearsay at all. So the statement would be admissible.

But looking at the options, option D says it's an exception as a spontaneous declaration to an opponent-party. That doesn't sound right. Because the exception would be under 801(d)(2), making it non-hearsay, not an exception. So perhaps D is incorrect.

Option E says it's inadmissible because it's hearsay and the owner isn't credible. But credibility goes to weight, not admissibility. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Statement of existing mental condition. FRE 803(3). This allows statements showing the declarant's then state of mind, emotion, etc. But the janitor's statement was a warning, which might indicate his belief about the danger, so perhaps it's admissible under 803(3). But I'm not sure if that applies here. The purpose would be to show the building owner had knowledge of the dangerous condition. Wait, but the janitor's statement to the owner would be offered to prove that the owner knew about the problem, right? So the janitor's statement that "she was bound to get hurt because of floor problems" would indicate that the owner was aware of the dangerous condition. So if the janitor told the owner that, it's being offered to show the owner's knowledge.

But under 803(3), the statement must be about the declarant's current mental state. So the janitor's statement about the floor being dangerous would be about his belief, which could be relevant. But I'm not sure if that's the best fit.

Option G: Hearsay within hearsay, no exceptions. So the building owner's testimony includes the janitor's statement, which is hearsay. If the janitor's statement itself is hearsay, and there's no exception, then the whole thing would be inadmissible. But if there's an exception for the janitor's statement, then G is wrong.

Option H: Yes, because the building owner can testify and be questioned. But that's not addressing the hearsay issue. The owner can testify, but what he's saying is hearsay unless an exception applies.

Option I: No, because it's irrelevant. But the statement is about a warning, which is relevant to the case—whether the owner knew about the dangerous condition, whether the student was warned. So I is probably incorrect.

Option J: No, because it's hearsay and no exceptions apply. If there's an exception, J is wrong.

So, going back, the main issue is whether the janitor's statement to the building owner falls under a hearsay exception or is non-hearsay.

The building owner is testifying about what the janitor told him. If the janitor is an employee, then the statement could be an admission by a party opponent under 801(d)(2)(D). Because the janitor was acting within the scope of his employment when he made the statement, perhaps. So the statement would be admissible as a party admission, making it non-hearsay. So the building owner's testimony about the janitor's statement would be admissible.

Looking at the options, which one aligns with this. None of the options explicitly mention party admissions. Let me check the options again.

Option D says it's a spontaneous declaration to an opponent. That's a different exception, but perhaps the janitor's statement isn't spontaneous. It was a warning given during his duties, perhaps.

Wait, but if the statement is offered as a party admission, then it's not hearsay at all. So the correct reasoning would be that the statement is admissible under 801(d)(2)(D), making it non-hearsay. But none of the options directly state this.

Looking at the options:

Option D refers to a spontaneous declaration to an opponent. That's not exactly right, but perhaps the janitor's statement was a present sense impression or excited utterance. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the janitor's statement is hearsay, but falls under another exception. Let's think about present sense impressions. FRE 803(1) allows statements describing an event made while the declarant was perceiving it or immediately thereafter. But the janitor's warning was about a dangerous condition, which may not be a present sense impression.

Alternatively, the janitor's statement could be a statement against interest under 804(b)(3), but that would require the statement to be against the janitor's interest. Telling the owner about a dangerous floor might not be against the janitor's interest.

Wait, maybe the janitor's statement is being offered to show that the building owner had knowledge of the dangerous condition. So the content is that the floor has problems. The janitor's statement is "I told her that running too fast is dangerous and she was bound to get hurt because of the floor problems." So the janitor is telling the owner that the floor is dangerous, which is being offered to prove that the owner knew about the floor issues.

In that case, the janitor's statement is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth, so hearsay. Unless it's covered by an exception.

Alternatively, if the janitor's statement is considered a statement by the building owner's employee concerning a matter within the scope of employment and during employment, then it's an admission under 801(d)(2)(D). So it's not hearsay.

So if that's the case, then the building owner's testimony about the janitor's statement is admissible because it's a party admission, not hearsay. So the correct answer would be that it's admissible, so looking for an option that says it's admissible because it's a party admission.

But looking at the options, none of them mention 801(d)(2)(D). Let's check the options again:

Option D: Spontaneous declaration to opponent. That's 803(2), excited utterance. Not the same.

Option H says yes because the owner can testify and be questioned. But that's not addressing the hearsay issue.

Wait, perhaps the janitor's statement is hearsay, but the building owner's testimony about it is hearsay within hearsay. So two layers: the owner's testimony about what the janitor said. So the janitor's statement is hearsay, and the owner's statement about it is hearsay as well. Unless both layers fall under exceptions.

But I don't think that's the case here. Alternatively, if the janitor's statement is admissible under a hearsay exception, and the building owner's testimony is not hearsay because he's testifying directly about what he was told.

Wait, no. The building owner's statement is about what the janitor told him, so it's the janitor's statement that's hearsay.

So, to sum up, the building owner's testimony includes the janitor's out-of-court statement. If the janitor's statement is an admission by a party opponent, then it's not hearsay. So the statement is admissible.

Looking back at the options, none of them directly state that it's a party admission. So perhaps the correct answer is that it's admissible because it's non-hearsay under 801(d)(2)(D). But looking at the options, option H says the owner can testify and be questioned, but that's about the right to testify, not the hearsay issue.

Wait, perhaps the statement is admissible as a present sense impression. If the janitor made the statement while perceiving the event or immediately after, then it could be admissible under 803(1). But in this scenario, the janitor was giving a warning during his duties, so maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement is not hearsay because it's being offered to show that the janitor made the statement, not for the truth of the matter asserted. But no, because the purpose is to show that the owner knew about the floor problem, which is the truth.

Wait, but if the statement is offered to show that the owner knew, then it's for the truth, so it's hearsay. Unless it's covered by an exception or is non-hearsay.

So perhaps the correct answer is that it's inadmissible because it's hearsay within hearsay. Let me think about that. If the building owner is testifying about what the janitor told him, that's one level of hearsay (the janitor's statement). If the janitor's statement itself is hearsay, then it's hearsay within hearsay, which would require both layers to have exceptions. But in this case, the janitor's statement is being offered for its truth, so it's hearsay. Unless the janitor's statement falls under an exception.

Alternatively, if the janitor's statement is a party admission, then it's not hearsay. So the building owner's testimony about it is admissible.

But looking at the options, none of the options mention party admissions. So perhaps the answer is that it's inadmissible because it's hearsay within hearsay, and no exceptions apply. That would be option G.

Wait, but if the janitor's statement is a party admission, then it's not hearsay, so it's only one level. So perhaps the building owner's testimony is admissible because the janitor's statement is a party admission.

But I need to check the options again. Let's see:

Option D: Yes, because it's a spontaneous declaration to an opponent. That would be if the janitor's statement was made in the heat of the moment. But the janitor was giving a warning, perhaps not spontaneous.

Option H: Yes, because the building owner can testify and be questioned. But that's about the right to testify, not hearsay.

Wait, perhaps the statement is admissible under the residual exception, but that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, maybe the building owner's statement is hearsay, but the janitor's statement is admissible under another exception, making the entire statement admissible.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement is not hearsay because it's being offered to show that the building owner took action, but that's not relevant here.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of it another way. The building owner is trying to testify that the janitor told him that he warned the student. So the purpose is to show that the janitor did warn the student, which might relate to the student's knowledge or assumption of risk.

But the issue is whether the janitor's statement is hearsay. If the janitor's statement is offered to prove that he warned the student (truth), then it's hearsay. Unless an exception applies.

What exceptions could apply? Let's think:

- Present sense impression: If the janitor's warning was made while perceiving the event or immediately after, but the scenario doesn't specify timing.

- Excited utterance: If the janitor was under stress when he made the statement, but the scenario doesn't indicate that.

- Statement against interest: If the janitor's statement was against his interest, but warning someone about a dangerous floor might not be against his interest.

Alternatively, the statement might be admissible as a statement of a then-existing mental state. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if the janitor's statement is a business record, but that's not the case here.

Wait, the building owner is the party, and the janitor is his employee. So under FRE 801(d)(2)(D), a statement is not hearsay if it's offered against an opposing party and was made by the party's employee on a matter within the scope of employment and during the employment relationship.

So the janitor's statement to the building owner would be an admission by a party opponent, making it non-hearsay. Thus, the building owner can testify about the janitor's statement because it's not hearsay.

Looking at the options, none directly mention this. So perhaps the correct answer is that it's admissible, but none of the options correctly state the reason. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that it's inadmissible because it's hearsay within hearsay, but that would only be the case if the janitor's statement is hearsay and there's another layer, which I don't think applies here.

Wait, the building owner is testifying about the janitor's statement. That's one level of hearsay. If the janitor's statement itself is not hearsay because it's a party admission, then it's admissible. So the correct answer would be that it's admissible, but the options don't clearly state this.

Looking again, option H says yes because the building owner can testify and be questioned. But that's more about the right to testify, not the hearsay issue. So perhaps the answer is that it's admissible under a hearsay exception, but the only applicable exception is that it's a party admission, which none of the options mention.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again.

Option G says it's hearsay within hearsay with no exceptions. So if the building owner's statement includes the janitor's statement, and the janitor's statement is hearsay, then it's hearsay within hearsay. Unless the janitor's statement falls under an exception.

So, if the janitor's statement is hearsay, and there's no exception, then the entire statement is inadmissible. Alternatively, if the janitor's statement is a party admission, then it's not hearsay, making the building owner's testimony admissible.

But without an option that states it's a party admission, perhaps the answer is that it's inadmissible as hearsay within hearsay. So option G would be correct.

Wait, but if the janitor's statement is a party admission, then it's not hearsay. So the building owner's testimony would only be hearsay if the janitor's statement is hearsay. If it's a party admission, then the building owner's testimony is not hearsay.

So perhaps the answer is that it's admissible, but the options don't include that reasoning. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that it's admissible under a different exception.

Wait, perhaps the janitor's statement is a statement for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment. No, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, the janitor's statement could be a statement of present state of mind under 803(3), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the janitor's statement is being offered to show the effect on the building owner, i.e., that the owner knew about the dangerous floor. So it's about the owner's state of mind, which would make it admissible under 803(3). But the statement is about the floor being dangerous, not directly about the owner's thoughts.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to approach it differently. The building owner wants to testify about the janitor's statement. The janitor's statement is hearsay unless an exception applies.

If the janitor's statement is an admission by a party opponent (the building owner's employee), then it's not hearsay. So the building owner's testimony is admissible
