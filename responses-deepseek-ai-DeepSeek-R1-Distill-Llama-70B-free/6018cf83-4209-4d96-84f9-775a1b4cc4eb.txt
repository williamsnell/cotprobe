Okay, so I've got this question about pricing strategies when introducing a new and unique product. Hmm, I remember that pricing strategies are different based on the product's lifecycle and market conditions. Let me think through each option.

The question is asking which is the most appropriate strategy when introducing a new and unique product. So, I need to consider what each strategy entails.

Option A: Bundle pricing. That's when you sell multiple products together at a discounted price. But if the product is new and unique, maybe bundling isn't the first step. Usually, bundling is used to sell related items together, not really for introducing a single new product.

Option B: Psychological pricing. This involves pricing to influence consumer psychology, like setting a price at $9.99 instead of $10. It's more about perception. Not sure if that's the main strategy for a new product launch, though.

Option C: Price skimming. I think this is when you set a high price initially because the product is new and unique. The idea is to skim off the top of the marketâ€”the early adopters who are willing to pay more. Then, as competition comes in, you might lower the price. This sounds like a good fit for a unique product because you can capture high willingness to pay early on.

Option D: Cost-plus pricing. This method adds a markup to the cost of production. It's straightforward, but it doesn't consider market demand or competition. If the product is unique, you might not know the costs yet or the value perceived by customers, so this might not be the best approach initially.

Option E: Penetration pricing. This is about setting a low price to quickly gain market share. It's often used when you want to enter a competitive market and attract customers fast. But if the product is unique and there's little competition, penetration pricing might not maximize profits early on.

Option F: Economy pricing. This is used for low-cost, high-volume products. It's no-frills, like budget airlines or store brands. Doesn't seem right for a unique, possibly premium product launch.

Option G: Promotional pricing. This involves temporary discounts or special offers to boost sales. More of a short-term tactic, maybe during holidays or special events. Not necessarily the main strategy for a new product introduction.

Option H: Competitive pricing. Setting prices based on what competitors charge. But if the product is unique, there might not be direct competitors, making this strategy less applicable.

Option I: Premium pricing. This is setting a higher price to convey high quality or exclusivity. It's similar to price skimming in that it targets customers willing to pay more. But I think premium pricing is more about the brand image and ongoing strategy, whereas skimming is a temporary strategy during introduction.

Option J: Value-based pricing. This sets prices based on the value perceived by the customer. It can be effective, but when introducing a new product, the perceived value might not be clear yet, especially if it's unique and customers haven't seen it before.

So, putting it all together, when a product is new and unique, the company can charge a higher price because there's no competition, and early adopters are willing to pay more. This is price skimming. Premium pricing is similar, but skimming is specifically about capturing that initial high price before others enter the market. Penetration is the opposite, low price to gain share quickly, which might not be needed if the product is unique and in demand.

Therefore, the answer should be C: Price skimming.

The most appropriate pricing strategy when introducing a new and unique product is **price skimming**. This strategy involves setting a high initial price to capture the willingness to pay among early adopters, especially when the product has no direct competition. It allows the company to maximize profits before potential competitors enter the market and before the need to lower prices arises. Other strategies like penetration pricing focus on gaining market share quickly, which may not be necessary for a unique product, or like premium pricing, which is more about brand image and less about the introductory phase. Therefore, price skimming is the best fit.

Answer: C
