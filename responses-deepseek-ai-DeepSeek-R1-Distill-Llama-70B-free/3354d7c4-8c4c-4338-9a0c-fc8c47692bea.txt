Okay, so I have this problem about a compound DC generator and I need to find its efficiency and input horsepower. Hmm, I remember that efficiency is the ratio of output power to input power, and input horsepower is related to the input power. But wait, what's the exact formula again? Oh right, efficiency η = (output power) / (input power) × 100%. And input power would be the output plus all the losses.

The problem gives me a 125-kW generator. So the output power is 125,000 watts. But wait, the output is the load, right? So output is 125 kW. But I need to find the input, which is output plus losses.

The generator is a cumulative compound, long-shunt connected. Oh wait, in a long-shunt, the shunt field winding is in parallel with both the series and armature. So the shunt current is I_shunt = V / R_shunt. Here, R_shunt is the field resistance, R_f, which is given as 30 ohms. The terminal voltage V is 250 V, so I_shunt = 250 / 30 ≈ 8.333 A. Wait, but the question says that at rated conditions, the shunt-field current is 5A. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, wait. Oh, maybe that's because in a compound machine, the series winding also carries current, but in a long-shunt connection, the shunt is across the armature and series combined. So the shunt field current is determined by the terminal voltage divided by R_shunt. But in this case, the shunt current is given as 5A. So maybe the terminal voltage is less than 250 V? Or perhaps I'm not considering something else.

Wait, the problem says when operated at rated speed, load, and terminal voltage, the shunt-field current is 5A. So V is 250 V, and I_shunt is 5A. So using I = V/R_shunt, R_shunt would be 250/5 = 50 ohms. But wait, the problem states R_f is 30 ohms. That's a contradiction. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. Or perhaps it's a different configuration. Alternatively, maybe the shunt field current is 5A under these conditions, perhaps because the series winding affects it? Or maybe the shunt current is 5A when considering the entire circuit, including series resistance.

Wait, perhaps the shunt field resistance is 30 ohms, so normally I_shunt would be 250/30 ≈ 8.33 A, but under these conditions, it's 5 A. That doesn't add up. Maybe the series field is contributing to the excitation, so the shunt current is lower. Because in a compound machine, the series field adds flux, so the shunt doesn't have to provide as much current.

Wait, in a cumulative compound generator, the series and shunt fields aid each other. So the total flux is the sum of shunt flux and series flux. So when the load current increases, the series flux increases, which increases the total flux. So the shunt current would be lower than what it would be in a simple shunt generator because the series field is helping.

So in this case, maybe the shunt field current is 5A, and the series field current is higher. Because the shunt field only needs to supply part of the excitation.

But maybe I should first list all the given data:

- Output power (P_out): 125 kW = 125,000 W
- Rated voltage (V): 250 V
- Speed (n): 1800 rev/min
- Winding resistances:
  - Armature resistance (r_a): 0.025 ohms
  - Series field resistance (r_se): 0.010 ohms
  - Shunt field resistance (r_f): 30 ohms
- Stray power loss (P_stray): 5000 W at rated voltage and speed
- Shunt-field current (I_f) under operating conditions: 5 A

Wait, the shunt current is given as 5 A. So I can calculate the shunt field loss as I_f² * R_f. So 5² *30 = 25 *30=750 W.

Then, the series field current (I_se) is the same as the load current because in a long-shunt compound generator, the series field is in series with the armature, so I_se = I_a, the armature current.

Wait, no. Wait, the series field is in series with the armature. So the current through the series field is the same as the armature current, which is the load current plus the shunt field current. Because the armature current I_a is equal to I_load + I_shunt.

Wait, no. Wait, in a generator, the armature current supplies the load and the shunt field. So I_a = I_load + I_shunt.

Wait, but in a long-shunt connection, the shunt field is across the armature plus series field. So the shunt current is I_shunt = V / (R_shunt). But in this case, V is across R_shunt, which would be 250 V. So normally, I_shunt = 250 /30 ≈8.33 A. But the problem states that under operating conditions, I_shunt is 5 A. That suggests that perhaps the terminal voltage is not 250 V when calculating the shunt current, but that doesn't make sense because the problem states the terminal voltage is 250 V.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's proceed step by step.

First, find all the losses.

Stray power loss is given as 5000 W. That's fixed.

Then, the shunt field copper loss: I_shunt² * R_shunt = 5² *30 = 750 W.

The series field copper loss: I_series² * r_se. But I_series is the same as the armature current (I_a), which is I_load + I_shunt.

Wait, what's I_load? I_load is the output current. Since output power is 125 kW at 250 V, P = VI, so I_load = 125,000 /250 = 500 A.

So I_a = I_load + I_shunt = 500 +5 =505 A.

So series field current is 505 A. Thus, series loss is (505)^2 *0.010 = let's compute that.

505 squared: 500²=250000, 2*500*5=5000, 5²=25. So 250000 +5000 +25=255025. Multiply by 0.01: 2550.25 W.

Then, armature copper loss is I_a² * r_a =505^2 *0.025.

505 squared is 255025, multiplied by 0.025: 255025 *0.025=6375.625 W.

So total copper losses are shunt loss + series loss + armature loss.

Wait, no: the armature resistance is r_a. So the armature copper loss is I_a² * r_a. The series field is a separate resistance, so its loss is I_series² * r_se. And the shunt loss is I_shunt² * R_shunt.

So summing them up:

Shunt loss:750 W

Series loss:2550.25 W

Armature loss:6375.625 W

Total copper loss: 750 +2550.25 +6375.625 = let's compute:

750 +2550.25 =3300.25; 3300.25 +6375.625=9685.875 W.

Plus the stray power loss of 5000 W. So total losses are 9685.875 +5000 =14685.875 W.

So total input power is P_out + losses: 125,000 W +14,685.875 W =139,685.875 W.

Efficiency is (P_out / P_in) *100 = (125000 /139685.875) *100.

Let me compute that. 125000 /139685.875 ≈0.8953 or about 89.53%.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, the output is 125,000 W. The losses are:

- Shunt:5^2 *30=750 W.

- Series:505^2 *0.01=2550.25 W.

- Armature:505^2 *0.025=6375.625 W.

Total copper:750+2550.25=3300.25+6375.625=9685.875 W.

Plus stray:5000 W.

Total loss:9685.875 +5000=14685.875 W.

So input P = 125,000 +14,685.875 = 139,685.875 W.

Efficiency: 125000 /139685.875 = approximately 0.8953, so 89.53%.

But wait, looking at the options, the highest efficiency is 92% (option I) and 90% (A). So 89.5% is option E. But let's check the input power and efficiency again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the armature current. Let me think again.

Wait, in a compound generator, when it's long-shunt, the shunt field is across the armature and series field. So the shunt current is determined by V/(R_shunt). But under these conditions, the shunt current is given as 5A. So V is 250 V, so R_shunt is 250/5=50 ohms. But the problem says R_f is 30 ohms. That's conflicting. So maybe I'm miscalculating the shunt current.

Wait, perhaps the shunt field is connected across the armature, so the voltage across it is V + I_se * r_se? Or wait, no, the shunt is connected across the armature. So the voltage is V = I_shunt * R_shunt + I_se * r_se?

Wait, no. Let me correct. In a long-shunt connection, the shunt field is connected across the armature, which has the series field in series with it. So the voltage across the shunt field is equal to the terminal voltage (V) minus the voltage drop in the series field (I_se * r_se). Because the series field is in series with the armature, so the series field's voltage drop is I_se * r_se.

So V_shunt = V - I_se * r_se. And since the shunt is a resistor, V_shunt = I_shunt * R_shunt.

Therefore, I_shunt = (V - I_se * r_se) / R_shunt.

But wait, in this problem, we have I_shunt given as 5 A. Hmm, perhaps we can use that to find I_se.

Wait, I_se is the same as I_a, the armature current, right? Because the series field is in series with the armature. So I_se = I_a.

I_a is the sum of load current and shunt current: I_a = I_load + I_shunt.

I_load is 500 A (from 125 kW /250 V). So I_a =500 +5=505 A.

But then, according to the equation:

I_shunt = (V - I_se * r_se) / R_shunt.

V is 250 V. So substituting:

5 = (250 - 505 * 0.010) /30.

Compute denominator: 505 *0.01=5.05.

So numerator:250 -5.05=244.95.

Then, 244.95 /30 ≈8.165 A.

But the given I_shunt is 5 A, which is not matching. So perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the voltage across the shunt wrong. Let me think again.

In a long-shunt connection, the shunt field is connected across the armature, which has the series field in series. So the voltage across the shunt field is the same as the terminal voltage minus the voltage drop in the series field.

So V_shunt = V - (I_se * r_se) → I_shunt = (V - I_se * r_se)/ R_shunt.

But I_se is the same as I_a, which is I_load + I_shunt.

So substituting I_se = I_a = I_load + I_shunt.

So:

I_shunt = [ V - (I_load + I_shunt) * r_se ] / R_shunt.

Let me plug in the numbers:

V=250 V, I_load=500 A, r_se=0.010 ohms, R_shunt=30 ohms.

So,

I_shunt = [250 - (500 + I_shunt)*0.010 ] /30.

Multiply both sides by 30:

30 I_shunt =250 -0.010*(500 + I_shunt).

Compute 0.010*(500 + I_shunt)=5 +0.010 I_shunt.

So,

30 I_shunt =250 -5 -0.010 I_shunt →30 I_shunt +0.010 I_shunt =245 →30.010 I_shunt=245 →I_shunt=245 /30.010 ≈8.1667 A.

But wait, the problem says I_shunt is 5 A. So this is a contradiction. That suggests that perhaps the given I_shunt is 5 A is incorrect, but the problem states it's 5 A under these conditions. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the generator is operating in a different condition. Maybe the series field resistance is considered differently.

Wait, maybe the series field resistance is included in the armature resistance? Hmm, the problem lists the resistances separately: r_a is armature resistance, r_se is series field resistance. So the armature resistance is just r_a, and the series field is separate.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the induced voltage and then find the armature current. Hmm, maybe that's a better approach.

In a DC generator, the induced voltage E is equal to V + I_a r_a + I_se r_se. Because the voltage drop in the armature and series field resistances reduces the induced voltage to the terminal voltage.

Wait, no, actually, the terminal voltage V is equal to E - (I_a r_a + I_se r_se).

Wait, no. Wait, for a generator, the induced voltage E is higher than the terminal voltage V, because of the voltage drops in the armature and series resistances.

The formula is:

E = V + I_a r_a + I_se r_se.

But in a long-shunt compound generator, the series field's current is the same as the armature current, so I_se = I_a.

So E = V + I_a (r_a + r_se).

But in a compound generator, the generated voltage E depends on the flux, which is a combination of the shunt and series fields.

Hmm, but perhaps I can find E using the shunt field current.

Wait, the shunt field resistance is R_shunt=30 ohms. The shunt current is 5 A. So the voltage across the shunt field is V_shunt = I_shunt * R_shunt =5 *30=150 V.

But in a long-shunt connection, the shunt field is across the armature, so the voltage across it should be equal to the terminal voltage minus the series field's voltage drop.

Wait, that's what I thought earlier. But according to this, V_shunt =5*30=150 V.

But V_shunt is also supposed to be V - I_a r_se.

So:

150 =250 - I_a *0.010.

So I_a = (250 -150)/0.010 =100/0.010=10,000 A. That's way too high. That can't be right. So something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the polarity wrong. In a generator, the voltage drop would be such that E is higher than V. So E = V + I_a (r_a + r_se).

But wait, in the shunt field, the voltage is V_shunt = I_shunt * R_shunt.

But V_shunt is also equal to the terminal voltage V minus the voltage drop in the series field. So:

V_shunt = V - I_se r_se.

But I_se = I_a, so:

I_shunt R_shunt = V - I_a r_se.

So:

I_shunt = [V - I_a r_se ] / R_shunt.

Given that I_shunt is 5 A, V=250 V, r_se=0.010, R_shunt=30.

So:

5 = [250 - I_a *0.010 ] /30.

Multiply both sides by30: 150 =250 -0.010 I_a.

→0.010 I_a =250 -150=100 →I_a=100 /0.010 =10,000 A.

That's impossible because the armature current can't be 10,000 A. That suggests that perhaps the initial approach was wrong. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the shunt field is connected across the armature plus series field, so the voltage across the shunt is V + I_se r_se? No, that doesn't make sense. Or maybe it's V plus the series voltage drop? Hmm, I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, maybe the shunt field is in parallel with the series field and armature combined. So the voltage across the shunt is the same as the voltage across the series plus armature. So:

V_shunt = V + I_se r_se.

Wait, that would make more sense for a long-shunt connection. So:

I_shunt R_shunt = V + I_se r_se.

Because the shunt is connected across the entire armature-series combination. So the voltage across the shunt would be V + the drop in the series field.

Wait, but that would mean:

I_shunt = (V + I_se r_se) / R_shunt.

But in this case, I_se is I_a, which is I_load + I_shunt.

So substituting I_se = I_a = I_load + I_shunt.

So,

I_shunt = [ V + (I_load + I_shunt) r_se ] / R_shunt.

Let me plug in the numbers.

V=250, I_load=500, r_se=0.010, R_shunt=30.

So,

I_shunt = [250 + (500 + I_shunt)*0.010 ] /30.

Compute numerator:

250 + (500 + I_shunt)*0.010 =250 +5 +0.010 I_shunt =255 +0.010 I_shunt.

So,

I_shunt = (255 +0.010 I_shunt)/30.

Multiply both sides by30:

30 I_shunt =255 +0.010 I_shunt.

30 I_shunt -0.010 I_shunt =255 →29
