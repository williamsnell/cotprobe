Okay, so I've got this problem here about Mr. Thomas buying a lawn mower on an installment plan. Hmm, I need to find out the monthly payment and the true interest rate. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the lawn mower costs $190, and he's paying it off in 6 equal monthly payments. There's a service charge of 8% per year, which is a flat fee. Wait, so is that 8% annually or monthly? I think it's annual because it says per year. But wait, since he's paying monthly, I might need to adjust the rate.

Wait, so the service charge is 8% per year. So that's the annual interest rate? Or is that just a fee? Hmm, I might be getting confused here. Let me clarify. The problem says it's a service charge, so perhaps that's the interest rate. So the interest is 8% per annum.

But wait, when you pay in installments, the interest calculation might be different. Maybe it's a simple interest? Or is it something else like amortized? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify, so I might have to assume simple interest. Or perhaps it's using the installment method where each payment includes both principal and interest.

Wait, the question is about the true interest rate. Oh, right, sometimes the rate given isn't the true rate because of compounding or the way payments are structured. So the 8% might be the nominal rate, but the true rate could be higher because he's paying back over six months.

Wait, no, the payment is monthly, but the service charge is annual. So perhaps the 8% is the annual rate, and we need to calculate the effective rate based on monthly payments.

But wait, maybe the 8% is a flat rate. So the total interest charged is 8% of $190. Let me calculate that. 8% of 190 is 0.08 * 190 = $15.20. So the total amount he has to pay is 190 + 15.20 = $205.20. Then, this amount is divided into 6 equal payments. So each payment would be 205.20 / 6 = $34.20. Wait, but looking at the options, option A is $34.17 and 14.5%. Hmm, that's close. But wait, why is there a slight difference?

Alternatively, maybe the interest is calculated differently. Maybe it's not a simple interest. Perhaps it's being amortized. Let me think about that.

When you have an installment plan, each payment includes both principal and interest. The interest is calculated on the outstanding balance each month. So the total amount would be higher than just adding 8% upfront. Or wait, no—because the 8% is a flat fee, maybe that's the total interest, not compounded. So the total amount would be 190 + (0.08 * 190) = $205.20 as before.

Wait, but then why is the monthly payment $34.20, which is approximately $34.17 in option A? Because when I divide 205.20 by 6, I get exactly 34.20. So why is option A $34.17? Maybe I'm missing something in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest is not a flat rate but an 8% annual rate, and we have to compute the true interest rate considering the monthly payments. So the true interest rate would be higher than 8% because each payment reduces the principal, so the effective rate increases.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try another approach.

The true interest rate (also known as the effective annual rate) is calculated when payments are made more than once a year. Since he's paying monthly, the effective rate would be higher than the nominal 8%.

The formula for effective annual rate is: (1 + (r/n))^n - 1, where r is nominal rate, n is number of payments per year.

But wait, in this case, he's paying monthly, so n=12, but the loan is only for 6 months. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, we can model this as a simple interest loan, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, let's model it as an installment loan. For an installment loan, the monthly payment (PMT) can be calculated using the present value of an annuity formula. The formula is:

PMT = P * [ i(1+i)^n ] / [ (1+i)^n - 1 ]

Where:
P = principal ($190)
i = monthly interest rate (annual rate divided by 12)
n = number of payments (6)

But wait, the service charge is 8% annually. So if this is the annual interest rate, then the monthly rate i would be 8% / 12 = 0.006666...

Wait, but if that's the case, then let's plug in the numbers.

PMT = 190 * [ 0.0066667*(1+0.0066667)^6 ] / [ (1+0.0066667)^6 - 1 ]

Let me compute that step by step.

First, compute (1 + 0.0066667)^6.

0.0066667 is approximately 1/150, but let me compute it numerically.

(1.0066667)^6 ≈ let's see:

1.0066667^1 = 1.0066667
^2 = approx 1.0133778
^3 ≈ 1.020045
^4 ≈ 1.02673
^5 ≈ 1.033435
^6 ≈ 1.040134

So approximately 1.040134.

Now, the numerator inside the brackets: 0.0066667 * 1.040134 ≈ 0.0069325.

The denominator: 1.040134 - 1 = 0.040134.

So the fraction is 0.0069325 / 0.040134 ≈ 0.1728.

So PMT ≈ 190 * 0.1728 ≈ 32.832. So approximately $32.83 per month.

But looking at the options, F is $32.93 and 13.7%. Hmm, that's pretty close. But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the exponent.

Wait, let me compute (1 + 0.0066667)^6 more accurately.

Using a calculator approach:

(1.0066667)^6:

Compute each step:

1.0066667^1 = 1.0066667
^2 = 1.0066667 * 1.0066667 ≈ 1.0133778
^3 = 1.0133778 * 1.0066667 ≈ 1.020046
^4 = 1.020046 * 1.0066667 ≈ 1.026726
^5 = 1.026726 * 1.0066667 ≈ 1.033417
^6 = 1.033417 * 1.0066667 ≈ 1.040112

So the value is approximately 1.040112.

So numerator: 0.0066667 * 1.040112 ≈ 0.006932

Denominator: 1.040112 - 1 = 0.040112

So 0.006932 / 0.040112 ≈ 0.17285.

So PMT = 190 * 0.17285 ≈ 190 * 0.17285.

190 * 0.1 is 19, 0.07 is 13.3, 0.00285 is approx 0.5415. So 19 + 13.3 = 32.3 + 0.54 is 32.84. So about $32.84 per month.

Looking at the options, F is $32.93, which is very close. The slight difference might be due to more precise calculations.

Now, what about the true interest rate? Wait, the question asks for the true interest rate he was charged. So the 8% is the nominal annual rate, but the true rate (effective annual rate) is higher because the interest is compounded more frequently (monthly in this case, but the loan is only for 6 months).

Wait, but he's paying over 6 months, so maybe the effective rate is calculated differently. Alternatively, perhaps the true interest rate is the rate that, when applied to the principal, gives the total interest paid as a percentage.

So the total amount paid is 6 * PMT. Using PMT ≈ $32.84, total is 6 * 32.84 ≈ $197.04. So total interest is 197.04 - 190 = $7.04. So the interest rate would be (7.04 / 190) * 100 ≈ 3.7% for six months. To find the annual rate, we can double it, which would be 7.4%, but wait, that doesn't make sense because the nominal rate was 8%.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing simple interest with something else. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the effective annual rate based on the true interest rate.

Wait, the true interest rate (effective) can be calculated using the formula:

( (1 + (r/n))^n ) - 1, where r is the nominal rate and n is the number of periods.

But wait, in this case, the loan is for 6 months, so n=6. Wait no—n would be the number of compounding periods per year, but since we're paying monthly, it's 12. Hmm, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the effective annual rate (EAR) is the rate that would give the same return as the nominal rate compounded more frequently. So if the nominal rate is 8% annually, and it's compounded monthly, the EAR would be (1 + 0.08/12)^12 - 1 ≈ 8.3%. But that's the EAR when compounding monthly over a year.

But in this case, the loan is only for half a year, so perhaps the EAR isn't the same as the full year. Alternatively, perhaps the true interest rate is considering the effective rate for the 6-month period.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The question is about the true interest rate he was charged. So the 8% is the nominal annual rate, but the effective rate considering he's paying monthly would be higher. Alternatively, since the loan is only for 6 months, perhaps the effective rate is calculated over that period.

Wait, maybe another approach: the total interest he's paying is $7.04 (from earlier calculation of 6 * 32.84 = 197.04; 197.04 - 190 = 7.04). So the interest for 6 months is $7.04. So the annual interest would be 7.04 * 2 = $14.08. So the annual interest rate would be (14.08 / 190) * 100 ≈ 7.42%, but that doesn't align with any of the options.

Hmm, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the true interest rate is calculated as the internal rate of return (IRR) of the payments.

Wait, the IRR would be the monthly interest rate that makes the present value of the payments equal to the principal.

Using the PMT we calculated earlier (~$32.84), let's compute the monthly rate.

The present value (PV) formula is:

PV = PMT * [1 - (1 + i)^-n ] / i

Here, PV is $190, PMT is ~32.84, n=6.

So 190 = 32.84 * [1 - (1 + i)^-6 ] / i

Let me rearrange this to solve for i.

Hmm, this might be a bit tricky without a calculator, but perhaps I can estimate.

Let's try i=0.006 (0.6% monthly):

(1 + 0.006)^-6 ≈ 0.964.

So [1 - 0.964] / 0.006 ≈ 0.036 / 0.006 = 6.

So 32.84 * 6 = 197.04, which is higher than 190. So the interest rate must be higher.

Wait, perhaps i=0.007 (0.7%):

(1.007)^-6 ≈ approx 0.957.

[1 - 0.957]/0.007 ≈ 0.043/0.007 ≈ 6.14.

32.84 * 6.14 ≈ 201. That's higher than 190, so the rate must be higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. If the monthly payment is $32.84, and we're trying to find the monthly interest rate, which when used to discount the payments gives $190.

Let me use the present value formula again.

190 = 32.84 * [ (1 - (1 + i)^-6 ) / i ]

Let me denote (1 + i)^-6 as v^6, where v is the present value factor.

So,

190 = 32.84 * (1 - v^6)/i

I can rearrange this to solve for i numerically. Alternatively, perhaps I can estimate using trial and error.

Let me try i = 0.65% per month (0.0065):

(1.0065)^6 ≈ let's compute it step by step.

1.0065^1 = 1.0065

^2 ≈ 1.0065 * 1.0065 ≈ 1.0130

^3 ≈ 1.0130 * 1.0065 ≈ 1.0196

^4 ≈ 1.0196 * 1.0065 ≈ 1.0263

^5 ≈ 1.0263 * 1.0065 ≈ 1.0330

^6 ≈ 1.0330 * 1.0065 ≈ 1.0397

So v^6 = 1/(1.0397) ≈ 0.9619.

So (1 - v^6)/i = (1 - 0.9619)/0.0065 ≈ 0.0381 / 0.0065 ≈ 5.864.

So 32.84 * 5.864 ≈ 192.5, which is higher than 190. So the actual i must be a bit higher than 0.65%.

Let me try i=0.66% (0.0066):

(1.0066)^6: Let me compute.

1.0066^2 ≈ 1.0132

^3 ≈ 1.0132 * 1.0066 ≈ 1.0199

^4 ≈ 1.0199 * 1.0066 ≈ 1.0267

^5 ≈ 1.0267 * 1.0066 ≈ 1.0334

^6 ≈ 1.0334 * 1.0066 ≈ 1.0401.

v^6 = 1/1.0401 ≈ 0.9610.

(1 - 0.9610)/0.0066 ≈ 0.039 / 0.0066 ≈ 5.909.

32.84 * 5.909 ≈ 194.0, which is higher than 190. Hmm, that's not right. Wait, no, because when i increases, the denominator increases, so the factor decreases. So when i is 0.0066, the factor is 5.909, so 32.84 * 5.909 ≈ 194. Wait, but that's higher than 190, which can't be right because a higher i would require lower present value. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong.

Wait, the present value is 190 = PMT * (1 - v^6)/i.

So if i increases, (1 - v^6)/i decreases, so the product would be lower. So when I tried i=0.0065, I got 192.5, which is higher than 190. So to get 190, I need a higher i, which would lower the present value.

Wait, perhaps I should try i=0.67% (0.0067).

Compute (1.0067)^6:

1.0067^2 ≈ 1.0134

^3 ≈ 1.0134 * 1.0067 ≈ 1.0201

^4 ≈ 1.0201 * 1.0067 ≈ 1.0269

^5 ≈ 1.0269 * 1.0067 ≈ 1.0337

^6 ≈ 1.0337 * 1.0067 ≈ 1.0405.

v^6 = 1/1.0405 ≈ 0.9606.

(1 - 0.9606)/0.0067 ≈ 0.0394 / 0.0067 ≈ 5.88.

32.84 * 5.88 ≈ 193, which is still higher than 190. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use the rule of 78 or another method, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should instead calculate the total interest paid and then find the effective rate. So each payment is approximately $32.84, so 6 payments = $197.04. So total interest is $7.04 over 6 months. So the annual rate would be (7.04 / 190) * 200% = (7.04/190)*2 ≈ 7.4% annually. But that's lower than the 8% nominal rate. That doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the true interest rate is the rate that makes the present value of the payments equal to $190. So using the same formula, but I'm not making much progress.

Wait, looking back at the options, option F is $32.93 monthly and 13.7% true interest rate. That seems plausible because the monthly payment I calculated was about $32.84, which is close to $32.93. So maybe the true interest rate is higher than 8% because it's compounded monthly, so the effective annual rate (EAR) is higher.

The EAR formula is (1 + r/n)^n - 1, where r is the nominal rate and n is the number of times compounded. If the nominal rate is 8% and compounded monthly, the EAR would be (1 + 0.08/12)^12 -1 ≈ 8.3%. But that's not matching any of the options here.

Wait, but in this case, the loan is only for 6 months, so maybe the effective rate is calculated over that period. Alternatively, perhaps the true interest rate is the rate that, when applied to the principal, would yield the total interest over 6 months, then annualized.

Wait, the total interest is $7.04 over 6 months. So the 6-month interest rate is 7.04/190 = 0.037, which is
