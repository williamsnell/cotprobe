Question:

A package of paper towels has 12 rolls of paper towels in it. Mr. Kelly wants to put an equal number of rolls of paper towels into 4 rooms. He uses the number sentence below to find the number of rolls of paper towels, t, he should put into each room. 12 ÷ t = 4 Which number sentence shows another way Mr. Kelly can find the number of rolls of paper towels, t, he should put into each room?

Options:

A: 12 – t = 4
B: 4 ÷ 12 = t
C: 4 × t = 12
D: t – 4 = 12
E: 4 + 12 = t
F: 4 – t = 12
G: t + 4 = 12
H: t ÷ 4 = 12

Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully. 

So, there's a package of paper towels with 12 rolls. Mr. Kelly wants to put an equal number of these rolls into 4 rooms. He uses the equation 12 ÷ t = 4 to find out how many rolls (t) each room should get. Now, the question is asking which other number sentence can be used to find the same t. The options are from A to H, each with different equations.

Hmm, let's break it down. Mr. Kelly has 12 rolls and wants to split them equally into 4 rooms. So each room gets the same number of rolls. That means we're dividing the total rolls by the number of rooms. 

The original equation given is 12 ÷ t = 4. Wait, that doesn't look right to me. Because if 12 divided by t equals 4, then t would be 3, since 12 divided by 3 is 4. But wait, that would mean each room gets 3 rolls. But wait, that can't be right because 4 rooms with 3 rolls each would be 12 rolls, which matches the total. So t is 3 in that case. 

Wait, maybe I got that backwards. Let me think again. The equation is 12 ÷ t = 4. So solving for t, you can rearrange it. If 12 divided by t equals 4, then t must be 12 divided by 4, which is 3. So each room gets 3 rolls. So t equals 3. 

But the question is asking for another way to write the equation. So the original is 12 ÷ t =4. What's another way? Well, division can be represented as multiplication by the reciprocal. So 12 ÷ t =4 is the same as 12 =4 * t. Because if you divide 12 by t and get 4, then multiplying 4 by t gives 12. 

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches that. Option C is 4 × t =12. Yes, that looks right. Because 4 times t equals 12, so t would be 3. 

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let's go through the other options. 

Option A: 12 – t =4. That would mean t is 8 (12-4=8), which doesn't make sense because 4 rooms with 8 rolls each would be 32 rolls, way more than 12. So A is out. 

Option B:4 ÷12 =t. That would make t 1/3, which is 0.333, but you can't have a fraction of a roll in each room. So that's not possible. 

Option C is 4 × t =12. As I thought earlier, that gives t=3, which is correct. 

Option D: t –4=12 → t=16. Again, 4 rooms with 16 rolls each would be 64 total, which is way more than 12. So no. 

Option E:4 +12 =t → t=16. Same problem as D. 

Option F:4 –t=12 → t= -8. Negative rolls? No way. 

Option G:t +4=12 → t=8. Again, same issue as A and D. 

Option H:t ÷4=12 → t=48. That can't be right because 4 rooms with 48 rolls each is 192 rolls, which is way more than 12. 

So the only option that makes sense is C, which is 4 × t =12. That correctly represents the problem because you're finding how many groups of 4 (the number of rooms) fit into 12, which gives the number of rolls per room. 

Wait, but another thought: sometimes when you have division, you can express it as a multiplication problem. So 12 divided by t equals 4 is the same as 12 equals 4 times t. So yes, that's exactly option C. 

I think that's solid. So the answer should be C.

The problem involves distributing 12 rolls of paper towels equally into 4 rooms. Mr. Kelly uses the equation \( 12 \div t = 4 \) to find the number of rolls, \( t \), per room. Solving this, \( t = 3 \), as \( 12 \div 3 = 4 \). The task is to identify an alternative number sentence that represents the same relationship.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: \( 12 - t = 4 \) implies \( t = 8 \), which is incorrect because 4 rooms with 8 rolls each would total 32 rolls, not 12.
- **Option B**: \( 4 \div 12 = t \) implies \( t = \frac{1}{3} \), which is not practical since rolls cannot be fractional.
- **Option C**: \( 4 \times t = 12 \) is correct because \( t = 3 \), and \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \), matching the total number of rolls.
- **Option D**: \( t - 4 = 12 \) implies \( t = 16 \), which is incorrect because 4 rooms with 16 rolls each would total 64 rolls.
- **Option E**: \( 4 + 12 = t \) implies \( t = 16 \), which is also incorrect for the same reason as D.
- **Option F**: \( 4 - t = 12 \) implies \( t = -8 \), which is nonsensical as rolls cannot be negative.
- **Option G**: \( t + 4 = 12 \) implies \( t = 8 \), which is incorrect for the same reason as A.
- **Option H**: \( t \div 4 = 12 \) implies \( t = 48 \), which is incorrect because 4 rooms with 48 rolls each would total 192 rolls.

The correct answer is **Option C**, as \( 4 \times t = 12 \) accurately represents the problem and yields \( t = 3 \).
