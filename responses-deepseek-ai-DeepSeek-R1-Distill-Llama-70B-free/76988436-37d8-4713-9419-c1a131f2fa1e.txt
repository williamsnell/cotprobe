Okay, so I have this economics question here about the market for denim jeans. I'm a bit rusty on my supply and demand concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that the market for denim jeans is in equilibrium. Then, the price of polyester pants, which are a substitute good, rises. I need to figure out what happens in the jean market.

Hmm, substitute goods... Substitute goods are products that can be used in place of each other. So if the price of polyester pants goes up, people might look for alternatives. Denim jeans are a substitute for polyester pants, right?

When the price of a substitute increases, the demand for the original good should increase. Because if polyester pants are more expensive now, people might buy more jeans instead. So the demand for jeans would rise.

Wait, let me visualize the graph. So in the jeans market, the demand curve would shift to the right. Because at every price level, more jeans are demanded now. So, when demand increases, what happens to price and quantity?

In a market, when demand increases, the price of jeans should go up. And as price goes up, quantity supplied also increases because suppliers are willing to sell more at higher prices. So the equilibrium quantity would increase.

So putting it together: the demand for jeans rises, leading to an increase in price and an increase in the quantity supplied. Wait, but the question asks about the quantity in the market. So in equilibrium, higher demand leads to higher price and higher quantity.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one says demand rises, price increases, and quantity increases.

Let's check the options:

Option F says demand rises, increasing the price and increasing the quantity. That seems right.

Option B says demand rises, but price decreases and quantity increases. No, because if demand increases, price should go up, not down.

Option C says demand rises, price increases, but quantity decreases. That doesn't make sense because higher price usually leads to higher quantity supplied.

So the correct answer must be F.

The market for denim jeans is in equilibrium, and the price of polyester pants, a substitute good, rises. Substitute goods are products that can be used in place of each other, so when the price of polyester pants increases, consumers are likely to shift their demand to denim jeans. This shift increases the demand for jeans. 

As demand rises, the demand curve shifts to the right. At every price level, more jeans are now demanded. With higher demand, the price of jeans increases. As the price rises, suppliers are incentivized to produce more, leading to an increase in the quantity supplied. Therefore, the equilibrium price and quantity both increase in the jean market.

Analyzing the options, the correct choice is the one that states: demand rises, increasing the price and increasing the quantity. This matches **Option F**.

Answer: F
