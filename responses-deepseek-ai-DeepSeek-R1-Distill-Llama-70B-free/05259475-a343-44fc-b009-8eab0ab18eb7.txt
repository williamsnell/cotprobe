Question:

This question refers to the following information.
The following quote is from Voltaire in response to the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.
My dear sir, nature is very cruel. One would find it hard to imagine how the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds. A hundred thousand ants, our fellows, crushed all at once in our ant-hill, and half of them perishing, no doubt in unspeakable agony, beneath the wreckage from which they cannot be drawn. Families ruined all over Europe, the fortune of a hundred businessmen, your compatriots, swallowed up in the ruins of Lisbon. What a wretched gamble is the game of human life! What will the preachers say, especially if the palace of the Inquisition is still standing? I flatter myself that at least the reverend father inquisitors have been crushed like others. That ought to teach men not to persecute each other, for while a few holy scoundrels burn a few fanatics, the earth swallows up one and all.
â€”Voltaire, in a letter, 1755

Okay, I need to figure out which option correctly represents the ideas expressed by Voltaire in his letter regarding the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. Let me read through the quote again to understand his perspective.

Voltaire is reacting to the earthquake, which was a devastating event. He talks about how nature is cruel and questions how such a disaster could happen in what is supposed to be the "best of all possible worlds." This phrase reminds me of the philosophical optimism of thinkers like Leibniz, who argued that this world is the best possible one created by God. Voltaire seems to be criticizing this view, suggesting that the suffering caused by the earthquake contradicts the idea of a benevolent universe.

He mentions the destruction of human life, families ruined, and the economic impact on businessmen. He also takes a swipe at the Inquisition, hoping that their palace was destroyed and that the inquisitors were crushed. This indicates his opposition to religious persecution and organized religion's power. He suggests that such events should teach people not to persecute each other, which aligns with Enlightenment values of tolerance and reason over dogma.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Many believed in preserving traditional religious doctrines. But Voltaire is critical here, so this doesn't fit.

Option B: Most rejected religion and became atheists. While he's critical of organized religion, not all Enlightenment thinkers were atheists. Some were deists or just critical of the church, not necessarily rejecting all religion.

Option C: Disconnected from common people. His letter seems to empathize with the suffering, so probably not disconnected.

Option D: Endorsed absolute monarchy. No, Enlightenment thinkers often criticized absolute power and advocated for reforms.

Option E: Suffering is inevitable and justified. Voltaire is questioning this, not endorsing it.

Option F: Rejected impact of science on society. No, the Enlightenment was about applying reason and science to society.

Option G: Abolish all governance. No, they wanted reforms, not necessarily abolition.

Option H: Used salons and pamphlets. Yes, Enlightenment thinkers used these methods to spread ideas. But does this relate to Voltaire's letter content? His letter is more about his critique of suffering and religion, not the method of communication.

Option I: New discoveries justify tolerance and objective approaches. This aligns with Voltaire's emphasis on reason and questioning religious dogma, promoting a more tolerant society.

Option J: Were accomplished scientists. While some were, Voltaire was more of a philosopher and writer, so this might not directly apply here.

So, the letter is about challenging the optimistic view of the world and religious persecution, promoting tolerance and reason. Option I seems to fit because Voltaire uses the disaster to argue for a more tolerant and rational approach, possibly influenced by scientific or rational thinking. Also, his critique implies that human suffering isn't justified, which ties into the broader Enlightenment ideas about using reason to improve society and challenge traditional authority.

The quote from Voltaire reflects his critique of the philosophical optimism that the world is the "best of all possible worlds," as he questions how such immense suffering could occur. He also criticizes religious persecution and the power of the Inquisition, advocating for a more tolerant and rational approach to societal issues. This aligns with the Enlightenment emphasis on reason, challenging traditional authority, and promoting tolerance. Among the options, the best fit is that many Enlightenment intellectuals believed new discoveries and rational thinking justified a more tolerant and objective approach to social and cultural issues.

Answer: I
