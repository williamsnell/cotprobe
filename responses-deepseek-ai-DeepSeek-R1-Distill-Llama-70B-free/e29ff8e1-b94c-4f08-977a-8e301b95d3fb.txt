Okay, so I've got this problem about compound interest, and I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

Mr. Josephson put $200 in a savings account that gives 4% interest, compounded semiannually. I need to find the present value after 2 years. Hmm, wait, present value usually refers to the current value, but in this context, I think they mean the future value after the 2 years. Or maybe present value as in the amount after the interest has been added over time. Either way, I think the formula for compound interest will help here.

I remember the formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt). Let me break that down. A is the amount after time t, P is the principal amount (initial investment), r is the annual interest rate (decimal), n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.

So in this problem, the principal P is $200. The interest rate r is 4%, which as a decimal is 0.04. It's compounded semiannually, so n is 2. The time t is 2 years.

Plugging these into the formula: A = 200*(1 + 0.04/2)^(2*2). Let me compute each part step by step.

First, 0.04 divided by 2 is 0.02. So 1 + 0.02 is 1.02. Then, the exponent is 2*2=4, so I have 1.02 raised to the 4th power.

Wait, how do I calculate 1.02 to the 4th? Let me think. I can compute this step by step. 1.02 squared is 1.0404. Then, 1.0404 squared again would be (1.0404)^2. Let me compute that.

1.0404 * 1.0404: Let's do it manually.

1.0404 * 1.0404:
Multiply 1.04 * 1.04 first. Hmm, 1.04 * 1.04 is 1.0816. But since it's 1.0404, maybe it's a bit more.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1.02^4 exactly. Another approach is to calculate each compounding step.

First, after the first compounding period (6 months), the amount becomes 200 * 1.02 = 204.

Second period: 204 * 1.02 = 208.08.

Third period: 208.08 * 1.02. Let me compute that. 208.08 * 0.02 is 4.1616, so 208.08 + 4.1616 = 212.2416.

Fourth period: 212.2416 * 1.02. 212.2416 * 0.02 is 4.244832. Adding that gives 212.2416 + 4.244832 = 216.486432.

Wait, but I'm getting approximately 216.49, which is one of the options. Let me check the options again. Option E is $216.49.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a calculation mistake. Alternatively, I could use the exponent approach.

So 1.02^4 is how much? Let me compute it accurately. 1.02^4.

1.02^1 = 1.02

1.02^2 = 1.02 * 1.02 = 1.0404

1.02^3 = 1.0404 * 1.02. Let's compute that.

1.0404 * 1.02: 1.04 * 1.02 is 1.0608, but since it's 1.0404, I think it's a bit more. Let me compute it precisely.

Multiply 1.0404 by 1.02:

1.0404 * 1.02 = (1 + 0.0404) * (1 + 0.02) = 1*1 + 1*0.02 + 0.0404*1 + 0.0404*0.02 = 1 + 0.02 + 0.0404 + 0.000808 = 1.061208.

Then 1.02^4 is 1.061208 * 1.02. Let me compute that.

1.061208 * 1.02: Let's break it down.

1.061208 * 1 = 1.061208

1.061208 * 0.02 = 0.02124316

Adding them together: 1.061208 + 0.02124316 = 1.08245116.

Wait, that can't be right because earlier step-by-step, I got to about 216.48 which is 200*(1.02)^4=200*1.08245116= 216.490232, which rounds to 216.49, so option E.

But wait, wait a second. When I calculated step by step, I got 216.4864, which is the same as 216.49. So that's correct.

Alternatively, I can think about the formula again. A = 200*(1 + 0.04/2)^(2*2) = 200*(1.02)^4. As I calculated, (1.02)^4 is approximately 1.0824516.

So 200 * 1.0824516 = 216.49032, which is $216.49. Looking at the options, option E is $216.49.

Wait, but I'm looking at the options, and option E is $216.49, which matches my calculation. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me calculate 1.02^4 again.

1.02 * 1.02 = 1.0404.

1.0404 * 1.02: Let's compute that. 1.04 * 1.02 is 1.0608, but 1.0404 is a bit more.

1.0404 * 1.02:

1.0404 * 1 = 1.0404

1.0404 * 0.02 = 0.020808

Adding them: 1.0404 + 0.020808 = 1.061208.

Then, 1.061208 * 1.02.

1.061208 * 1 = 1.061208

1.061208 * 0.02 = 0.02124316

Total is 1.061208 + 0.02124316 = 1.08245116.

So (1.02)^4 = 1.08245116.

So 200 * 1.08245116 = 216.490232, which is 216.49 when rounded to the nearest cent. So the correct answer is E: $216.49.

To solve the problem, we use the compound interest formula:

\[
A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}
\]

Where:
- \(P = 200\) (principal amount),
- \(r = 0.04\) (annual interest rate),
- \(n = 2\) (compounded semiannually),
- \(t = 2\) (time in years).

Substituting the values:

\[
A = 200 \left(1 + \frac{0.04}{2}\right)^{2 \cdot 2}
\]

First, calculate \(\frac{0.04}{2} = 0.02\), so:

\[
A = 200 \left(1.02\right)^4
\]

Next, compute \((1.02)^4\). Breaking it down:

\[
(1.02)^2 = 1.0404, \quad (1.0404)^2 = 1.08245116
\]

Thus:

\[
A = 200 \cdot 1.08245116 = 216.490232
\]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the amount after 2 years is:

\[
A = 216.49
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**E: $216.49**
