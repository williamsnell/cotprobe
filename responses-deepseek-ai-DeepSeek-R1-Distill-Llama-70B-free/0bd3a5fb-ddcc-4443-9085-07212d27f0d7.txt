Okay, so I've got this equation to solve: |x - 4| - 10 = 2. Hmm, I remember that absolute value equations can have two solutions because the expression inside can be positive or negative. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should probably isolate the absolute value part. So I'll add 10 to both sides of the equation. That would give me |x - 4| = 12. Yeah, that makes sense because 2 plus 10 is 12.

Now, the absolute value of something equals 12 means that the something itself can be either 12 or -12. So I'll split this into two separate equations.

The first case: x - 4 = 12. Solving for x, I just add 4 to both sides. So x = 12 + 4, which is 16. Okay, one solution is 16.

The second case: x - 4 = -12. Again, I'll add 4 to both sides. That gives x = -12 + 4, which is -8. So the other solution is -8.

Now the question asks for the product of all possible values of x. So I multiply the two solutions together: 16 * (-8). Let me calculate that. 16 times 8 is 128, and since one is negative, the product is -128.

Wait, let me double-check my steps. Starting from |x-4| -10 = 2. Adding 10 gives |x-4|=12. Splitting into two cases: x-4=12 and x-4=-12. Solving both gives x=16 and x=-8. Multiplying them: 16*(-8) = -128. Yep, that's correct.

Looking at the options, option J is -128. So the answer should be J.

The equation given is \(|x - 4| - 10 = 2\). To solve for \(x\), first isolate the absolute value by adding 10 to both sides:

\[
|x - 4| = 12
\]

This absolute value equation splits into two cases:

1. \(x - 4 = 12\)  
   Solving for \(x\):  
   \[
   x = 12 + 4 = 16
   \]

2. \(x - 4 = -12\)  
   Solving for \(x\):  
   \[
   x = -12 + 4 = -8
   \]

The two solutions are \(x = 16\) and \(x = -8\). The product of these values is:

\[
16 \times (-8) = -128
\]

Thus, the product of all possible values of \(x\) is \(-128\).
