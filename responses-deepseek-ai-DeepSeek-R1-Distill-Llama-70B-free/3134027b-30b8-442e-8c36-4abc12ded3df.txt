Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about a toroidal coil. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on toroids, but I think I can figure it out. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem is asking for the magnetic field of a toroidal coil using flux densities and then checking it with Ampere's law. The given parameters are: 500 turns, cross-sectional area is 6 cm², mean radius is 15 cm, and the current is 4A. I need to find the magnetic field.

Wait, I remember that the magnetic field inside a toroid can be calculated using a specific formula. Oh right, the formula is B = (μ₀ * N * I) / (2πr), where μ₀ is the permeability of free space, N is the number of turns, I is the current, and r is the mean radius. But wait, wait. Alternatively, I think sometimes it's written as B = (μ₀ * N * I) / (2 * π * R), where R is the mean radius. Yeah, that makes sense.

So first, I should note down all the given values. Let me convert them into SI units because the formulas in physics typically use meters, kilograms, etc. 

Cross-sectional area A is 6 cm², which is 6e-4 m². But wait, for the magnetic field formula I just mentioned, the cross-sectional area doesn't directly come into play for B. Oh wait, but if I'm using Ampere's law, perhaps it does? Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think.

Wait, no. Ampere's law for a toroid... Right, for a toroid, the magnetic field outside the coils is zero, and the field inside is given by that formula I mentioned. So the cross-sectional area might come into play when calculating the flux, but for B, it's given by that formula.

So let me proceed with the first method, using the formula. Let me plug in the numbers:

μ₀ is 4π × 10^-7 T·m/A.

N is 500 turns.

I is 4A.

Mean radius r is 15 cm, which is 0.15 meters.

So plugging into B = (μ₀ * N * I) / (2πr):

Wait, let me compute the numerator first. μ₀ is 4πe-7, times N (500) is (4πe-7 * 500) = 2000πe-7. Then multiply by I (4A): 2000πe-7 *4 = 8000πe-7.

Denominator is 2πr: r is 0.15 m. So denominator is 2π * 0.15 = 0.3π.

So B = (8000πe-7) / (0.3π).

Simplify. The π cancels out. So 8000e-7 / 0.3.

8000e-7 is 8e3 *1e-7 = 8e-4. So 8e-4 / 0.3 is (8/0.3) *1e-4.

8 divided by 0.3 is approximately 26.666... So 26.666e-4 T. Which is 2.6666e-3 T. Hmm, 2.6666e-3 Tesla. Wait, that's about 2.667 mT.

Wait, but let me check my steps again. Let me compute the numerator again:

μ₀ * N * I = 4πe-7 * 500 *4.

4pi *500 = 2000 pi. 2000 pi *4 = 8000 pi. So 8000 pi e-7. That's correct.

Denominator: 2 pi r, r=0.15 m. So 2 * pi * 0.15 = 0.3 pi.

So 8000 pi e-7 / 0.3 pi = (8000 / 0.3) * (pi / pi) *e-7.

8000 /0.3 is same as 80000/3, which is approximately 26666.666... So 26666.666e-7 = 2.6666e-3 T, yes.

Wait, but let me compute 8000 / 0.3 accurately. 0.3 is 3e-1. So 8000 / 0.3 = 8000 * (1/0.3) = 8000 * 3.333... = 26666.666...

So 26666.666e-7 T is 2.66666e-3 T.

So B is approximately 2.666e-3 T, which is 2.666 mT.

But wait, let me think. Alternatively, perhaps I should express it using exact fractions.

8000 / 0.3 = 8000 * 10/3 = 80000/3 ≈ 26666.6667.

So 26666.6667e-7 T is 26666.6667 * 1e-7 = 2.66666667e-3 T.

So B ≈ 2.6667e-3 T.

Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see this value. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: 1.9 × 10^-6 A-T/m

B: 1,250 A-T/m

C: 1,500 A-T/m

D: 4,400 A-T/m

E: 850 A-T/m

F: 2,000 A-T/m

G: 2,700 A-T/m

H: 3,200 A-T/m

I: 2,120 A-T/m

J: 1.6 × 10^-6 A-T/m

Wait, none of these options are close to 2.666e-3 T. That's about 0.002666 T, which is 2.666 mT.

Hmm, but the options are in the range of hundreds to thousands of A-T/m. Wait, A-T/m? Wait, that's Ampere-Turn per meter. Oh wait, maybe I'm confusing the units here.

Wait, the magnetic field B is in Tesla. But the options are in A-T/m. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, perhaps the question is actually asking for the field in terms of magnetic flux density, which is Tesla, but the options are given in A-T/m which is the unit for H field (magnetic field intensity), not B. Or perhaps the question is mistyped.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again.

"Find the magnetic field of the toroidal coil using flux densities and check by Ampere's law."

Hmm, magnetic field is B, which is measured in Tesla. But the options are in (A-T)/m. Wait, that's the unit for H, the magnetic field strength.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: The formula for B in a toroid is indeed (μ₀ N I)/(2π r). So let's compute that.

Given:

N = 500 turns.

I = 4A.

r = 0.15 m.

μ₀ = 4πe-7 H/m (henrys per meter).

So B = (4πe-7 * 500 *4) / (2 * π * 0.15).

Simplify numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 4πe-7 *500 *4 = 4 *500 *4 * πe-7 = 8000 πe-7.

Denominator: 2 * π * 0.15 = 0.3 π.

So B = (8000 πe-7) / (0.3 π ) = 8000e-7 / 0.3.

As before, 8000e-7 is 8e-4, so 8e-4 / 0.3 = 2.666...e-3 T.

Which is 2.666 mT, or 0.002666 T.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe I should use the flux approach.

Wait, another approach: The magnetic flux Φ is given by B * A, where A is the cross-sectional area. But how does that relate to the magnetic field?

Wait, the total flux linkage in a toroid is Φ = B * A, and the total flux Φ is also equal to (μ₀ N I A ) / (2π r), because Φ = B * A = [ (μ₀ N I ) / (2π r) ] * A.

Wait, but I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the formula again. The formula I used earlier should be correct. So why are the options so different?

Wait, looking at the options, they are all in the order of hundreds or thousands of A-T/m, except options A and J, which are 1e-6. So my calculation is giving me 2.666e-3 T, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait. Let me recompute the numbers.

μ₀ = 4πe-7 T·m/A.

N=500, I=4, r=0.15 m.

So numerator: 4πe-7 *500 *4.

Compute 4 *500 = 2000.

2000 *4 =8000.

So 8000 πe-7.

Denominator: 2 * π * 0.15 = 0.3 π.

So B = (8000 πe-7) / (0.3 π) = 8000e-7 / 0.3.

8000e-7 is 8e-4.

8e-4 / 0.3 = (8 / 0.3) * 1e-4.

8/0.3 is 26.666..., so 26.666e-4 T = 2.6666e-3 T.

Hmm, I think that's correct. So why are the options so different?

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Maybe the question is asking for the H field instead of B? Because the options are in A-T/m, which is the unit for H.

H is given by H = (N I ) / (2 π r), in A-T/m.

So let me compute H.

H = (N I) / (2 π r).

N=500, I=4, r=0.15.

So H = (500 *4 ) / (2 π * 0.15 )

= 2000 / (0.3 π )

2000 /0.3 = 6666.666...

6666.666... / π ≈ 2120.19 A-T/m.

Looking at the options, option I is 2120 A-T/m. So that would be the H field. But the question is about the magnetic field, which is B, which we calculated as 2.666e-3 T. But none of the options match B. So perhaps the question intended to ask for H, not B.

Wait, the question says "find the magnetic field of the toroidal coil using flux densities and check by Ampere's law."

Wait, magnetic field is B, but Ampere's law would relate to H. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using an alternative formula, considering the cross-sectional area in some way. Let me think.

Wait, another thought: The formula for B in a toroid is indeed (μ₀ N I )/(2 π r). So perhaps the question is correct, but I'm missing a factor. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me go through the calculation again with the correct units.

N=500, I=4A, r=0.15 m.

μ₀=4pi ×1e-7.

So B = (4pi ×1e-7) * 500 *4 / (2 pi *0.15 )

Simplify: 4pi cancels with 2 pi in the denominator, leaving 2.

So 4pi *500 *4 = 8000 pi.

Denominator: 2 pi *0.15 = 0.3 pi.

So 8000 pi / (0.3 pi ) = 8000 / 0.3 = 26666.666... then multiplied by 1e-7.

Wait, 1e-7 comes from μ₀, right? So 26666.666... *1e-7 = 2.6666e-3 T.

Same result as before. So I'm confident that B is 2.666e-3 T.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the question intended to ask for H, the magnetic field strength, which is 2120 A-T/m, which is option I.

Wait, but the question explicitly asks for the magnetic field B. So perhaps the options are incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use flux densities, as the question suggests. Let me think about that approach.

Flux density is B. The total flux Phi is B * A. The mean length of the toroid is 2 pi r_mean, which is the circumference, 2 pi *0.15 m.

The formula for Phi is also (mu_0 * N * I * A ) / (l_mean), where l_mean is the mean length.

So Phi = (mu_0 N I A) / (2 pi r).

Then, since Phi is also B * A, we can write B = (mu_0 N I ) / (2 pi r ), which is the same as before.

So again, same result.

Hmm. None of the options match 2.666e-3 T. So perhaps the problem is that the options are in A-T/m instead of Tesla. But then, the correct approach would have me compute H, which is 2120 A-T/m, which is option I.

But the question is asking for B, the magnetic field. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check the given values again.

Number of turns N =500, cross-sectional area A=6 cm² =6e-4 m², mean radius r=15 cm=0.15 m, current I=4A.

Wait, could I have mixed up radius and diameter? No, the problem says mean radius is 15 cm, so 0.15 m.

Wait, perhaps I should check Ampere's law approach. Let's see.

Ampere's law states that the closed loop integral of H · dl = I_encircled.

For a toroid, the H field is circular and has magnitude H = (N I) / (2 pi r).

So H = (500 *4 ) / (2 pi *0.15 ) ≈ 2000/(0.3 pi ) ≈ 2120 A-T/m, which matches option I.

But again, that's H, not B. So B would be mu_0 times H, which is 4pi ×1e-7 *2120.

Let me compute that: 4pi *2120e-7.

4 *2120 = 8480.

8480 * pi ≈ 8480 *3.1416 ≈ 26,645.28.

Multiply by 1e-7: 26,645.28e-7 = 2.6645e-3 T, which matches our earlier calculation of B.

So B is about 2.6645e-3 T.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer was H, which is option I (2120 A-T/m).

But the question says 'find the magnetic field', which is B. So this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, but I can't see where.

Wait, perhaps the cross-sectional area is involved in another way. Let me think about the formula again.

Wait, another approach: The magnetic field in the toroid can also be found using B = mu_0 mu_r (N I ) / (2 pi r ), where mu_r is the relative permeability. But since it's an air core, mu_r is 1, so it doesn't affect the calculation.

Hmm, same result.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different formula, like B = (mu_0 I N )/(2 r ), but without pi? No, that's not correct.

Wait, alternative formula: B = (mu_0 I N )/(2 pi r ). That's what I used.

So I think my calculation is correct. But the options don't have it. So perhaps the intended answer is option I, the H field.

But the question specifically asks for B. So I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, looking back at the options, option B is 1250 A-T/m. Option I is 2120 A-T/m. Let me compute H as 500*4/(2 pi *0.15) = 2000/(2 pi *0.15) = 2000/(0.3 pi ) ≈ 2000/(0.9425) ≈ 2120. Which matches option I.

So H is 2120 A-T/m, which is option I.

But the question asks for B. So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps the question intended to ask for H, not B, and the options are correct. But the question says 'magnetic field', which is B. So perhaps the options are wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in units somewhere.

Wait, another thought: Let me check if the formula is correct. I'm using B = mu_0 (N I) / (2 pi r ). Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to use the formula B = (mu_0 N I A )/(2 pi r ), which would be incorrect because A is area, which isn't in the formula. So no, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps the formula is B = (mu_0 I )/(2 pi r ). Then, with N=500, that would be B = mu_0 * I * N / (2 pi r ), which is the same as before.

So I think my approach is correct, and the answer should be approximately 2.666e-3 T.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is option I, the H field, even though the question asks for B. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute everything again step by step.

Compute B = (mu_0 * N * I )/(2 pi r )

mu_0 = 4pi ×1e-7 T·m/A.

N=500 turns.

I=4 A.

r=0.15 m.

So:

B = (4pi ×1e-7) * 500 *4 / (2 pi
