Question:

On December 30, a restaurant entered into a written contract with a bakery to supply the restaurant with all of its bread needs for the next calendar year. The contract contained a provision wherein the restaurant promised to purchase "a minimum of 100 loaves per month at $1 per loaf. " On a separate sheet, there was a note stating that any modifications must be in writing. The parties signed each sheet. Both sides performed fully under the contract for the first four months. On May 1, the president of the bakery telephoned the manager of the restaurant and told him that, because of an increase in the cost of wheat, the bakery would be forced to raise its prices to $1. 20 per loaf. The manager said he understood and agreed to the price increase. The bakery then shipped 100 loaves (the amount ordered by the restaurant) to the restaurant, along with a bill for $120. The restaurant sent the bakery a check for$100 and refused to pay any more. Is the restaurant obligated to pay the additional $20?

Options:

A: Yes, because the May 1 modification was enforceable even though it was not supported by new consideration.
B: No, because the bakery failed to provide written notice of the price increase as stipulated in the original contract.
C: No, because the price increase was due to external factors and not a decision by the bakery.
D: Yes, because the bakery detrimentally relied on the modification by making the May shipment to the restaurant.
E: No, because the original contract did not specify a price adjustment clause.
F: No, because the modifying contract was not in writing; it was, therefore, unenforceable under the UCC.
G: Yes, because the restaurant was aware of the price increase before the delivery was made.
H: No, because there was no consideration to support the modification.
I: Yes, because the restaurant manager verbally agreed to the price increase.
J: Yes, because the price increase is minimal and doesn't significantly affect the restaurant's expenses.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this contract law question. Let me read it carefully.

So, the restaurant and the bakery had a written contract on December 30. The contract says the restaurant will buy a minimum of 100 loaves per month at $1 each. There's a separate sheet noting that any modifications must be in writing, and both parties signed each sheet. They performed the contract fully for the first four months.

Then on May 1, the bakery's president called the restaurant manager. They said they have to raise the price to $1.20 because of increased wheat costs. The manager agreed. Then the bakery shipped 100 loaves and billed $120. The restaurant only paid $100 and refused to pay more. The question is whether the restaurant is obligated to pay the extra $20.

Hmm. So, the main issues here are about contract modification. I remember that under the UCC, which governs sales contracts, there are rules about modifying contracts. 

Wait, the contract had a clause saying any modifications must be in writing. So that's a no-oral-modification (NOM) clause. Under UCC § 2-209, such clauses are generally enforceable, but there are exceptions. 

UCC 2-209(2) says that a signed agreement which excludes modification except by a signed writing can't be otherwise modified, but except as between merchants, such a clause can be waived by conduct. However, when both parties are merchants, which they probably are here (restaurant and bakery), the clause is enforceable unless there's a waiver.

So, if the NOM clause is in place, any modification needs to be in writing. Here, the modification was oral—the manager agreed over the phone. But under 2-209(4), although an attempt at modification which doesn't satisfy the writing requirement may still operate as a waiver.

Wait, but in this case, the bakery didn't just propose a modification; the manager agreed. So perhaps the restaurant is bound by that, despite the NOM clause. Or maybe not?

Alternatively, even if the NOM clause is present, there's the issue of consideration. Modifications under UCC don't require consideration to be valid, unlike common law. So pre-existing duty rule doesn't apply. So even if there's no new consideration, the modification can still be enforceable.

Wait, but the NOM clause is about the form, not the consideration. So if the parties have a NOM clause, any modification without writing isn't enforceable unless an exception applies.

So the bakery tried to modify orally. The NOM clause requires writing, so the modification isn't enforceable unless the restaurant waived the NOM clause.

Waiver can be by conduct. So if the restaurant accepted the goods after the oral modification, that might indicate waiver.

In this case, the restaurant accepted the 100 loaves and paid $100. But they refused to pay the extra $20. So did their conduct indicate waiver? 

Wait, the modification was about the price. The bakery shipped the same quantity as before, just at a higher price. The restaurant accepted the shipment, but only paid the original price. Does that mean they accepted under the original terms, rejecting the modification?

Alternatively, by agreeing orally, the manager might have waived the NOM clause. Because waiver can be oral, I think. So if the manager agreed, that could be a waiver of the NOM clause.

But another point is that the UCC allows for waiver even without consideration. So even if the manager agreed orally, that could be a waiver of the NOM clause.

So putting it together, the NOM clause requires modifications to be in writing. The bakery tried to modify orally. But the restaurant manager agreed. So, under 2-209, the oral agreement might be a waiver of the NOM clause. 

Wait, but the NOM clause says modifications must be in writing. So if the manager agreed orally, that could be a waiver of that clause. Because waiver can be oral, even if the contract says otherwise. So the modification would be effective because the NOM was waived.

Alternatively, the restaurant could argue that the oral agreement wasn't sufficient because the NOM clause requires a writing. But I think that under UCC 2-209, even with a NOM clause, the parties can waive it by their conduct. So the oral agreement might suffice as a waiver.

But wait, what about the consideration? Under UCC, modifications don't require consideration. So even if there's no new consideration, the modification is valid if it's enforceable.

So in this case, the bakery increased the price. The restaurant agreed. But is that modification enforceable despite the NOM clause? Because the NOM clause was waived by the oral agreement.

Alternatively, without a writing, the modification isn't enforceable unless the NOM is waived. So the real issue is whether the restaurant's oral agreement constitutes a waiver of the NOM clause.

Yes, because waiver can be established by conduct, and the manager agreed. So the NOM is waived. Therefore, the modification is valid, and the restaurant has to pay the extra.

Wait, but looking at the answer options:

Option A says yes, because the modification was enforceable without consideration. But that's about consideration, not the NOM clause.

Option F says no because the modifying contract wasn't in writing, making it unenforceable under UCC. But F would be correct if the NOM wasn't waived.

Option H says no because no consideration. But under UCC, consideration isn't required, so H is incorrect.

Option I says yes because the manager verbally agreed. So that's about the waiver of the NOM.

Option B says no because no written notice as per the contract. But if the NOM was waived, B is incorrect.

So the key is whether the oral agreement waived the NOM clause.

Yes, because under UCC 2-209(4), a waiver can be retracted unless it causes detriment. But here, the bakery relied on it by shipping the goods. So the restaurant can't now retracts the waiver.

Wait, so the restaurant accepted the goods. So they can't now claim that the NOM wasn't waived because they accepted the goods under the modified terms.

Wait, but the restaurant only paid the original amount. So maybe that indicates that they didn't accept the modification.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me think. The bakery shipped the goods after the oral modification. The restaurant accepted them but only paid the original price. So perhaps they're treating it as if the modification never happened.

But the manager agreed on the phone. So that's a problem. Did the manager have authority to agree? I assume so, as they're the manager.

So the restaurant is bound by the manager's agreement to the modification. Because the manager agreed, the NOM clause is waived, so the modification is valid.

Therefore, the restaurant has to pay the extra $20. So the answer would be either A or I.

Option A says yes, because no new consideration is needed. That's correct under UCC.

Option I says yes because the manager agreed. But the real issue is waiver of the NOM, which is allowed by oral agreement.

So the correct answer is either A or I. Alternatively, maybe F is wrong because the NOM was waived, making the oral modification enforceable.

Wait, but without a writing, can the modification be enforced? Because the NOM clause requires writing, but the parties waived that by oral agreement.

So the answer is A or I.

Wait, the question is about whether the restaurant is obligated to pay. So the bakery is trying to enforce the higher price. The issue is whether the modification is enforceable.

Under UCC, the modification without consideration is enforceable, even without consideration, so the bakery can enforce it if the NOM clause was waived.

So the answer is yes. So the options are A, D, G, I, or J.

Looking again:

Option A: Yes, because the May 1 modification was enforceable even without new consideration. Correct because UCC doesn't require consideration.

Option I: Yes, because the manager verbally agreed. So that would be about waiver of NOM.

But the point is that the NOM was waived by the oral agreement, so the modification is valid.

So the correct reason is either A or I.

But the question is about whether the restaurant is obligated to pay. The reason is that the modification was enforceable despite the NOM because it was waived.

So the correct answer would be A or I.

Wait, but the initial contract required modifications in writing. The oral agreement could be a waiver of that requirement. So under 2-209(5), a party who has made a waiver may retract it, unless the retraction would be unjust in view of a detriment suffered by the other party.

Here, the bakery relied on the waiver by shipping the goods. So the restaurant can't retract the waiver. Therefore, the modification is enforceable.

So the reason is that the modification is enforceable despite the NOM clause because the restaurant waived it. So the answer is I, because the manager agreed, thereby waiving the NOM.

Wait, but option A says it's enforceable even without consideration. Which is true, but the main issue here is the NOM clause. So without the waiver, the modification wouldn't be enforceable. So the key is the waiver.

So the correct answer is I: Yes, because the restaurant manager verbally agreed to the price increase.

Alternatively, option F says no because the modifying contract wasn't in writing, but that's incorrect because the NOM can be waived orally.

Wait, but another angle: Under UCC 2-209(2), a NOM clause is enforceable between merchants, but can be waived by conduct. So the manager's oral agreement could be conduct indicating waiver.

So yes, the NOM was waived, so the modification is enforceable. Therefore, the restaurant must pay the extra.

So looking at the options, the correct answer is either A or I.

Another thought: Option F says no because the modifying contract wasn't in writing. But under UCC 2-209, the NOM can be waived orally, so F is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer is A: Yes, because the modification was enforceable even without new consideration.

Wait, but the reason isn't about consideration; it's about the NOM. Hmm.

Wait, the question is about whether the restaurant is obligated to pay. The reason the bakery can enforce the modification is that the NOM was waived. But another reason is that under UCC, consideration isn't needed for modification.

Wait, the presence of a NOM clause doesn't affect the consideration issue. So even if the NOM wasn't waived, the modification could be enforced without consideration. But in this case, the NOM was waived, so the modification is valid.

So the fact that no consideration is needed makes the modification enforceable, but that's separate from the NOM issue.

So the correct answer would be A, because even without consideration, the modification is enforceable.

Alternatively, I think the main obstacle is the NOM clause, but once that's waived, the modification stands, regardless of consideration.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me try to outline the issues:

1. Contract has NOM clause, so modifications must be in writing.

2. The parties orally agreed to modify.

3. Under UCC 2-209, NOM can be waived by conduct, even if the contract says otherwise.

4. The manager's agreement could be considered a waiver.

5. Therefore, the modification is enforceable despite the NOM clause.

6. Additionally, under UCC, no consideration is needed for the modification.

So the restaurant is obligated to pay because the modification is valid.

Looking at the options, A says yes because no new consideration is needed. That's correct because UCC 2-209(1) allows modifications without consideration.

But the NOM clause is an obstacle unless waived. So the reason the modification is enforceable is because the NOM was waived, but even if it wasn't, the lack of consideration wouldn't matter.

Wait, no. The NOM is about the form, not the consideration. So even if the modification didn't meet the form requirement, it could still be unenforceable regardless of consideration.

So the correct reason is that the NOM was waived. So the answer would be I: Yes, because the restaurant manager verbally agreed.

But I'm not sure. Another approach is to think about the UCC rules:

- NOM clause: requires writing for modification.

- Waiver of NOM: can be oral.

- Even if NOM wasn't waived, under UCC, the modification is enforceable without consideration.

So the answer is A, because the modification is enforceable regardless of consideration, but the NOM could have been a problem. But since the parties waived NOM, it's a secondary point.

Alternatively, the correct answer is A.

Wait, the question is whether the restaurant is obligated to pay. The answer is yes because the modification is enforceable under UCC without consideration, and the NOM was waived by oral agreement.

But looking at the options, the best fit is A.

Hmm, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to think of this as a student would.

The contract has a NOM clause, so any changes must be in writing. The parties try to change it orally. Normally, that's not allowed, but under UCC, oral modifications can be enforceable if the NOM is waived.

So, the manager agreed, which could be a waiver. Therefore, the modification is valid, and the restaurant has to pay.

But the options don't perfectly capture this. Option I says yes because the manager agreed, which is about the waiver. Option A is about no consideration needed.

I think the correct answer is A, because under UCC, the modification doesn't require consideration, so it's enforceable. The NOM is a separate issue, but if it's waived, then the modification stands.

Wait, but without the waiver, the modification wouldn't be enforceable because of the NOM. So the NOM is the main issue here. Therefore, the correct answer is I: Yes, because the manager agreed, which waived the NOM.

Wait, but the manager's agreement was part of the waiver, making the modification enforceable. So the reason is the waiver, not the lack of consideration.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck, but I think the correct answer is A, because the modification is enforceable without consideration, and the NOM was waived.

Wait, perhaps the best way is to eliminate the options.

Option F: No, because modifying contract wasn't in writing. But UCC allows waiver of NOM by conduct, so F is incorrect.

Option H: No, because no consideration. But UCC doesn't require consideration, so H is incorrect.

Option B: No, because no written notice. But waiver can be oral, so B is incorrect.

Option E: No, because no price adjustment clause. But the contract's NOM is about form, not content, so E is incorrect.

Option C: No, because external factors. But that's not a defense; businesses can change prices, so C is incorrect.

Option D: Yes, because detrimental reliance. The bakery shipped after the agreement, so maybe that's a factor, but I think waiver is more direct. So D could be a reason, but not the main one.

Option G: Yes, because restaurant knew before delivery. Well, they did agree, so that's part of it, but again, the main issue is the waiver.

Option J: Yes, because minimal increase. That's not a legal reason, just a practical one, so J is incorrect.

So, between A and I.

Option A: Yes, because modification enforceable without consideration.

Option I: Yes, because manager agreed.

I think the main point is that the NOM was waived, so the answer is I. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, the modification is enforceable under UCC without consideration, so A is correct.

Wait, the NOM clause requires writing, but if it's waived, the oral modification is allowed. So the reason is waiver, making I correct.

But I'm a bit torn. Another approach: in the UCC, a modification without consideration is enforceable unless the NOM clause prevents it. Here, the NOM was present, but waived by the oral agreement. So the modification is valid.

So the correct answer is A because the modification is enforceable without consideration, and the NOM was waived, making the modification valid.

Alternatively, the answer could be A, but I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, no. The NOM clause is about the form. If the NOM is waived, the oral modification is allowed. So the enforceability comes from the waiver, not the lack of consideration.

So the correct answer is I: Yes, because the restaurant manager verbally agreed to the price increase.

But some might argue that the NOM wasn't waived because the agreement was oral, but under UCC, waiver can be oral.

I think the correct answer is A, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, it's I.

Wait, another way: the original contract requires writing for modification. The parties orally modified. Without waiver, this isn't allowed. But the manager agreed, so waiver. Therefore, the modification is valid. So the reason is waiver, not consideration.

So the answer is I.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe looking for the most correct answer.

I think the correct answer is A: Yes, because the modification was enforceable even without new consideration.

Because under UCC, even without consideration, the modification is valid, and the NOM was waived by the oral agreement.

So the restaurant has to pay.

The question revolves around the enforceability of a contract modification under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). The restaurant and the bakery entered into a written contract with a no-oral-modification (NOM) clause, requiring any modifications to be in writing. The bakery attempted to modify the contract orally by increasing the price, and the restaurant manager verbally agreed. The bakery then shipped the goods at the new price, but the restaurant only paid the original amount, refusing to pay the additional $20.

### Key Issues:
1. **No-Oral-Modification (NOM) Clause**: The contract included a NOM clause, which generally requires modifications to be in writing. Under UCC § 2-209, such clauses are enforceable, but they can be waived by conduct or oral agreement.
2. **Waiver of NOM Clause**: The restaurant manager's verbal agreement to the price increase could constitute a waiver of the NOM clause. Under UCC § 2-209(4), waiver can be established by conduct, and the bakery relied on this waiver by shipping the goods.
3. **Consideration**: Under UCC § 2-209(1), modifications do not require new consideration to be enforceable, unlike common law. Thus, the lack of consideration does not invalidate the modification.
4. **Detrimental Reliance**: The bakery relied on the oral agreement by shipping the goods, making it unjust for the restaurant to retract the waiver.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Correct. The modification is enforceable under UCC § 2-209(1), as no new consideration is required for a valid modification.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. While the NOM clause requires written modifications, it can be waived orally, as occurred here.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The price increase due to external factors (e.g., wheat costs) does not invalidate the modification.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. While detrimental reliance is a factor, the primary reason for enforceability is the waiver of the NOM clause.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The absence of a price adjustment clause does not affect the enforceability of the oral modification.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The modifying contract does not need to be in writing if
