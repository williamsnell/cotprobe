Question:

Large deficits of water can be only partly compensated for by renal conservation; drinking is the ultimate compensatory mechanism. What stimulates the subjective feeling of thirst which drives one to drink water?

Options:

A: Decreased blood sodium levels
B: Low plasma osmolarity
C: Low body temperature
D: High blood pressure
E: Low levels of antidiuretic hormone (ADH)
F: A high intracellular fluid volume
G: A low extracellular fluid volume and a high plasma osmolarity
H: High extracellular fluid volume
I: Increased saliva production
J: High glucose levels in the blood

Okay, so I've got this question about what stimulates the feeling of thirst. Hmm, I remember that thirst is related to the body's need to balance fluids. Let me think about the factors involved.

The question says that when there's a large water deficit, the kidneys can only do so much, so drinking is the main way to compensate. So, what makes us feel thirsty?

I recall that the body monitors the osmotic pressure of the blood. Osmotic pressure is about the concentration of solutes in the blood. When blood gets too concentrated, that's high plasma osmolarity. That should trigger thirst.

Wait, there's also the role of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). ADH helps the kidneys reabsorb water. So when the body is dehydrated, ADH increases to reduce water loss. But does ADH directly cause thirst, or is it something else?

Oh right, the sensation of thirst is mainly triggered by high plasma osmolarity and low blood volume. The body has osmoreceptors, probably in the hypothalamus, which detect when the blood is too concentrated. When that happens, the hypothalamus sends signals to the brain, making us feel thirsty.

Looking at the options, option G says a low extracellular fluid volume and high plasma osmolarity. That sounds right because both factors contribute. Low ECF volume means less blood plasma, which can happen with dehydration. High osmolarity is the high concentration of solutes, which occurs when there's not enough water.

Wait, but are both conditions necessary? I think either low ECF volume or high osmolarity can trigger thirst. Or maybe it's the combination. Oh, I think when ECF volume drops and osmolarity is high, that's a strong stimulus for both ADH release and thirst.

So looking at the options:

A: Decreased sodium. No, because lower sodium would mean lower osmolarity, which wouldn't trigger thirst.

B: Low plasma osmolarity. That's the opposite. When osmolarity is low, you don't feel thirsty.

C: Low body temp. Not related to thirst.

D: High BP. Maybe related to fluid volume, but not directly the cause of thirst.

E: Low ADH. ADH is released when you're dehydrated, so low levels would mean more water in urine, but that's not causing thirst.

F: High intracellular fluid. I don't think that's the main trigger.

G: Low ECF volume and high plasma osm. Yes, that makes sense.

H: High ECF volume. That's the opposite, you wouldn't be thirsty then.

I: Increased saliva. That's more about mouthfeel, maybe, but not the main driver.

J: High glucose. Like in diabetes, which can cause excessive thirst. But the question is about the direct stimulation of the feeling. High glucose does increase osmolarity, which ties into G.

Wait, so high glucose levels can lead to high plasma osmolarity because glucose is an osmotic solute. But the question is asking what directly stimulates thirst, so the direct cause would be the high plasma osmolarity. But option J isn't just about glucose; it's the effect of high glucose on osmolarity.

So in the options, G says both low ECF volume and high plasma osm. So that's the most accurate answer.

Thirst is a critical mechanism that drives water intake to maintain fluid balance in the body. It is primarily stimulated by two factors: a low extracellular fluid (ECF) volume and a high plasma osmolarity. Low ECF volume occurs when there is a deficit of water in the body, such as during dehydration, while high plasma osmolarity refers to an increased concentration of solutes in the blood. Both conditions signal the hypothalamus, which contains osmoreceptors, to trigger the sensation of thirst. This ensures that the body can replenish water and restore fluid balance.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Decreased blood sodium levels would lower plasma osmolarity, which does not stimulate thirst.  
- **B**: Low plasma osmolarity is the opposite of what triggers thirst.  
- **C**: Low body temperature is unrelated to thirst.  
- **D**: High blood pressure is not a direct cause of thirst.  
- **E**: Low levels of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) would lead to increased water loss, but ADH itself does not directly stimulate thirst.  
- **F**: High intracellular fluid volume is not a primary driver of thirst.  
- **G**: Low extracellular fluid volume and high plasma osmolarity are the correct triggers for thirst.  
- **H**: High extracellular fluid volume would reduce the need for water intake.  
- **I**: Increased saliva production is not a primary stimulus for thirst.  
- **J**: High glucose levels can indirectly lead to high plasma osmolarity, but the direct stimulus for thirst is the high osmolarity itself, not glucose levels specifically.

The most accurate answer is **G**, as it directly addresses the two key factors that stimulate the sensation of thirst.
