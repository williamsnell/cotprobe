Question:

Briefly describe the six major categories of abnormal behavior as given in the 1968 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-II) of the American Psychiatric Association.

Options:

A: DSM-II outlines the categories as personality patterns and disorders, specific childhood disorders, transient situational disturbances, physical conditions, psychotic disorders, and neurotic disorders.
B: DSM-II divides abnormal behavior into organic brain syndromes, mental disorders, psychoses, neuroses, personality disorders, and sociocultural disorders.
C: The six major categories of abnormal behavior in DSM-II are mental retardation, organic brain syndromes, psychoses not attributed to physical conditions, neuroses, personality disorders and other nonpsychotic mental disorders, and psychophysiological disorders.
D: The six categories are psychoses, neuroses, personality disorders, mental retardation, organic brain syndromes, and mood disorders.
E: The six major DSM-II categories are anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, factitious disorders, dissociative disorders, sexual dysfunctions, and sleep disorders.
F: DSM-II categorizes abnormal behavior into neuroses, personality disorders, psychoses, cognitive disorders, mood disorders, and anxiety disorders.
G: DSM-II identifies the categories as adjustment disorders, developmental disorders, impulse control disorders, factitious disorders, sexual and gender identity disorders, and somatoform disorders.
H: The six categories defined by DSM-II include psychophysiological disorders, personality disorders, sexual deviations, alcoholism and substance misuse, disorders of character and behavior, and intellectual disabilities.
I: Abnormal behavior is classified into substance-related disorders, schizophrenia spectrum disorders, neurodevelopmental disorders, bipolar and related disorders, depressive disorders, and trauma- and stressor-related disorders according to DSM-II.
J: The six categories are anxiety disorders, dissociative disorders, mood disorders, schizophrenia and other psychoses, personality disorders, and eating disorders.

Okay, so I need to figure out the six major categories of abnormal behavior as outlined in the DSM-II. I remember that the DSM has gone through several editions, with each making changes to how mental disorders are classified. The DSM-II was published in 1968, and I think it had a different structure compared to the current DSM-5.

From what I recall, the DSM-II was more psychoanalytically oriented and grouped disorders into broader categories. I think it included categories like neuroses and psychoses, which are terms that were more commonly used back then. Neuroses typically referred to less severe disorders, while psychoses were more severe, often involving breaks from reality.

Looking at the options, I see that option A mentions categories like personality patterns and disorders, specific childhood disorders, transient situational disturbances, etc. That seems a bit too detailed, and I'm not sure if that's how DSM-II categorized them. Option B talks about organic brain syndromes and others, but I'm not certain if that's accurate for DSM-II.

Option C lists mental retardation, organic brain syndromes, psychoses not due to physical conditions, neuroses, personality disorders, and psychophysiological disorders. That sounds plausible because I remember that DSM-II did include categories like organic brain syndromes and distinguished between different types of psychoses and neuroses.

Option D includes mood disorders, which I think came later in the DSM-III. So probably not D. Option E lists anxiety disorders and others, which again might be more specific than what DSM-II used. Option F mentions cognitive disorders, which I don't think were a major category in DSM-II.

Option H includes sexual deviations and alcoholism, which I believe were part of DSM-II. It also mentions intellectual disabilities, which might correspond to mental retardation in older terminology. So H could be a contender.

Option I and J seem to include categories that were introduced in later editions, like trauma- and stressor-related disorders, which I don't think were a separate category in DSM-II.

Wait, so if I'm trying to remember, DSM-II had categories like neuroses (e.g., anxiety neurosis, depressive neurosis), psychoses (like schizophrenia), personality disorders, and perhaps some others. Also, I think it had a section for mental retardation and organic brain syndromes. Oh, and maybe something about transient situational disturbances, which were stress-related.

Looking back at the options, option C includes mental retardation, organic brain syndromes, psychoses not attributed to physical conditions, neuroses, personality disorders, and psychophysiological disorders. That seems to fit what I was thinking.

Alternatively, option H includes psychophysiological disorders, which I think were in DSM-II as well. Option H's categories are psychophysiological, personality, sexual deviations, alcoholism, disorders of character, and intellectual disabilities.

Wait, I'm a bit confused now. Did DSM-II have psychophysiological disorders as a separate category? I think that might have been the case. Also, I remember that in DSM-II, homosexuality was classified as a sexual deviation, so that would fit into option H's sexual deviations category.

But then, what about the other categories? Option C has mental retardation, organic brain syndromes, psychoses, neuroses, personality disorders, and psychophysiological. Option H has psychophysiological, personality, sexual deviations, alcoholism, disorders of character, and intellectual disabilities.

I'm trying to recall the exact six categories. I think in DSM-II, the major categories were:

1. Mental Retardation
2. Organic Brain Syndromes
3. Psychoses (excluding those due to physical conditions)
4. Neuroses
5. Personality Disorders
6. Psychophysiological Disorders

That would match option C. Alternatively, I might be mixing up some details. But I'm pretty sure that option C includes neuroses and psychoses as separate categories, which makes sense for DSM-II.

Wait, another point: the DSM-II didn't have as many specific categories as later editions. It grouped disorders more broadly. So the six major categories would likely be broader, such as those in option C.

So I think the correct answer is C.

The DSM-II, published in 1968, categorized abnormal behavior into six major categories that were broader and more psychoanalytically oriented compared to later editions. These categories included:

1. **Mental Retardation**: Reflecting older terminology for intellectual disabilities.
2. **Organic Brain Syndromes**: Disorders attributable to physical brain conditions.
3. **Psychoses Not Attributed to Physical Conditions**: Severe mental disorders involving breaks from reality, such as schizophrenia.
4. **Neuroses**: Less severe disorders, including anxiety neurosis and depressive neurosis.
5. **Personality Disorders**: Long-standing patterns of maladaptive behavior.
6. **Psychophysiological Disorders**: Physical symptoms influenced by psychological factors.

Among the provided options, **Option C** accurately lists these six categories, aligning with the structure and terminology used in the DSM-II.

Answer: C
