Question:

A defendant was booked on a commercial airline flight. When the defendant arrived at the airport, two undercover police narcotics agents observed him. His appearance and actions led the police to believe that he fit the description of a predetermined profile of a drug courier. The officers approached the defendant and told him they wanted to detain him for questioning. The defendant asked what for, and the police explained that they were narcotics agents assigned to the airport and that he fit the profile of a drug courier. They then asked the defendant to hand over his overnight bag. The defendant refused. The officers then explained that he wouldn't be permitted to board the plane unless they inspected the contents of his bag. The defendant told the officers that he changed his mind and decided not to fly today after all. The officers still requested that the defendant turn his overnight bag over to them. The defendant did so, and then he was given permission to leave the airport. The next day, the police had a dog sniff the defendant's bag for narcotics. The results of this search gave police suspicion to believe that the bag contained narcotics. They opened the defendant's bag and found heroin inside. The defendant was subsequently arrested and charged with unlawful possession of narcotics. At trial, the defendant's attorney moves to prevent introduction of the heroin into evidence. This motion will most likely be

Options:

A: granted, because the police did not have probable cause to hold the bag overnight for the search.
B: denied, because the police had reasonable suspicion to believe that the bag contained narcotics.
C: denied, because the search was conducted with the help of a narcotics detection dog.
D: denied, because the defendant fit the predetermined profile of a narcotics courier.
E: granted, because the police did not have the right to prevent the defendant from boarding the plane.
F: denied, because the defendant voluntarily handed over his bag to the police.
G: denied, because the search resulted from a lawful airport detention.
H: granted, because the heroin was discovered as a result of an unlawful airport detention.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about criminal procedure, specifically dealing with searches and seizures. Let me go through it step by step.

First, the scenario: A defendant is booked on a commercial flight. Undercover police narcotics agents observe him and think he fits a drug courier profile. They approach him, tell him they want to detain him for questioning. He asks why, and they explain they're narcotics agents and he fits the profile. They ask for his overnight bag, which he refuses. Then they say he can't board unless they inspect the bag. He says he's changed his mind about flying, and then they still ask for the bag. He hands it over, they let him leave. The next day, they use a dog to sniff the bag, get a positive result, open it, find heroin, and arrest him. His lawyer moves to suppress the evidence.

The question is whether this motion will be granted or denied. The options are A through H, with various reasons.

I remember that in airport stops, the Supreme Court has dealt with this in cases like Florida v. Royer. In Royer, the Court said that police can stop someone if they have reasonable suspicion, which can be based on a drug courier profile. But they can't detain the person longer than necessary or under conditions that are more restrictive than necessary.

In this case, the officers had reasonable suspicion because he fit the profile. So they could approach and ask questions. But when the defendant refused to hand over the bag, the officers told him he couldn't board unless they inspected it. He then decided not to fly, so the officers still took the bag. The next day, they did a dog sniff.

I think the key issue here is whether the police could detain the bag overnight. Under what authority? I remember that in some cases, if the police have reasonable suspicion, they can detain luggage for a reasonable time to conduct a search, like a dog sniff. But if the detention becomes too long without probable cause, it might be unreasonable.

Wait, the case of United States v. Place comes to mind. In that case, the police had reasonable suspicion that Place's luggage contained drugs. They detained the luggage for 90 minutes to do a dog sniff, which the Court found was too long because they didn't have probable cause. However, if the dog sniff is done promptly, it's okay.

In our scenario, the police took the bag and did the sniff the next day. So that's at least 24 hours later. That seems like a long time. Without a warrant, detaining the bag that long would probably require probable cause, which they didn't have yet. They had reasonable suspicion, but not probable cause. So detaining it overnight might be an unreasonable seizure.

Alternatively, if the defendant abandoned the bag, but in this case, he handed it over to the police, which might be considered a consent. Wait, but he was told he couldn't board unless he handed it over. So was the consent voluntary? Or was it coerced?

In Florida v. Bostick, the Court said that police approaching a bus passenger and asking to search their luggage was consensual because the person was free to refuse. But in this case, the officers told him he couldn't board unless they inspected the bag. That sounds more coercive than Bostick. So maybe the consent wasn't voluntary. So the police didn't have consent to take the bag.

If the consent wasn't voluntary, then the police needed either a warrant or probable cause with exigent circumstances to search the bag. They didn't have probable cause yet, just reasonable suspicion. So holding the bag overnight wouldn't be allowed unless they had probable cause.

Alternatively, maybe the police could have detained the bag under the doctrine of reasonable suspicion for a short time. But a day seems too long. So the detention of the bag was longer than allowed without probable cause, making the evidence inadmissible.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Granted, because police didn't have probable cause to hold the bag overnight. That sounds right because they didn't have PC, only RS, and holding it too long without a warrant is a problem.

Option B: Denied because RS. But RS isn't enough for an extended detention without a warrant.

Option E: Granted because police couldn't prevent him from boarding. That might be another angle. The police can't detain someone by threatening to prevent boarding unless they comply. If they didn't have the authority to prevent him from boarding, then their action was unlawful. So when the defendant tried to leave, the police had no right to stop him, making the initial detention and the bag seizure unlawful.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The officers approached him, told him he fit the profile, asked for the bag. He refused. Then they said he can't board unless he lets them inspect. He then decided not to fly. So, by conditioning boarding on the search, was that a constitutional violation?

In the case where police condition letting someone go on their way on submitting to a search, that's not permissible. Because that would essentially be forcing the person to consent, which isn't voluntary. So the police can't say you can't board unless we search. That would likely make the consent invalid.

So the defendant's handing over the bag wasn't voluntary because he was under the duress of not being allowed to board. Therefore, the police didn't have consent. Without consent, they needed either probable cause and a warrant or reasonable suspicion and a limited detention.

Since they had RS, they could have detained the bag for a short time to conduct a dog sniff. But they held it overnight, which might be longer than necessary. So the detention was unreasonable, making the evidence inadmissible.

So the motion to suppress would be granted because the police didn't have probable cause to hold the bag overnight, or because the initial detention was unlawful, making the evidence tainted.

Looking back at the options, option A says granted because no probable cause to hold the bag overnight. Option E says granted because police had no right to prevent boarding.

Hmm. The initial issue might be whether the officers could condition boarding on the search. If that's an unlawful detention, then everything that follows is tainted.

In the case where the police unlawfully detain the person, any evidence obtained from that detention would be suppressed under the exclusionary rule.

So, the defendant tried to leave after deciding not to fly, but the officers still took the bag. If the initial stop was unlawful, then the taking of the bag is fruit of the poisonous tree.

Alternatively, if the initial stop was lawful (based on RS), but the detention became unlawful when they wouldn't let him leave unless he handed over the bag. So the police's actions in preventing him from leaving might constitute an unlawful seizure, making the subsequent consent to hand over the bag invalid.

So the key point is whether the police had the authority to prevent him from boarding. They don't have the authority to detain someone just based on RS beyond a certain point. Once the defendant decided not to fly, the police couldn't hold him further. So taking the bag after he decided not to fly might be an unlawful seizure.

Wait, but the police didn't hold him; they let him leave after he handed over the bag. So the issue is whether the police could condition the return of his bag on him allowing a search. Or perhaps, once he decided not to fly, the police had no right to retain his bag unless they had probable cause.

I think the main issue is that the police didn't have probable cause to search the bag, and they detained it longer than allowed under reasonable suspicion. So option A would be correct.

Alternatively, the problem is that the initial detention was unlawful because they couldn't prevent him from boarding. So option E would be correct.

But I'm a bit torn between A and E.

In the case where the police tell him he can't board unless he allows the search, that's akin to an unlawful detention because they're not allowing him to leave unless he complies. So the consent isn't voluntary. So the taking of the bag is unlawful.

So the initial seizure of the bag was unlawful, making the evidence inadmissible. Therefore, the motion would be granted, and the heroin would be suppressed.

Looking at the options, option H says granted because the heroin was discovered due to unlawful airport detention. That seems to fit because the detention of the defendant was unlawful, leading to the bag being taken.

Alternatively, option E says granted because police didn't have the right to prevent him from boarding. That's another way to look at it.

Wait, but if the police didn't have the authority to prevent him from boarding, then their action of conditioning boarding on the search was a violation. So the defendant was effectively under detention when he was not free to leave. So the detention became unlawful because it was based solely on RS, and they couldn't extend it further without PC.

But I think the key here is that once the defendant decided not to fly, the police's basis for detaining him (to prevent him from boarding) no longer applied. So they had no right to keep his bag. Therefore, holding the bag overnight was an unlawful seizure because they didn't have probable cause.

So the correct reason would be that the police didn't have probable cause to hold the bag overnight, making option A the answer.

Alternatively, the problem could be that the initial detention was unlawful because they prevented him from boarding, which they couldn't do without probable cause. So option E.

But I'm a bit unsure. Let me think of the case law again. In Florida v. Royer, the police had RS, so they could ask for ID and ask questions, but when the defendant tried to leave, the police couldn't further detain him without probable cause. In this case, the police went beyond reasonable detention by conditioning boarding on the search, which would require probable cause.

So the police's actions in preventing him from boarding unless he handed over the bag would be an unlawful extension of the detention beyond what is permitted under RS. So the defendant's decision to hand over the bag was not voluntary because he was under duress.

Therefore, the police didn't have consent to take the bag, and without probable cause, they couldn't detain the bag overnight. So option A is correct because they lacked probable cause to hold the bag, and option H is about the unlawful detention leading to the search.

Wait, but the detention of the bag overnight was the problem. So the police didn't have probable cause to seize the bag and hold it for a day. Therefore, the evidence is tainted, so the motion is granted.

So I think option A is the correct answer.

The scenario involves a defendant who was stopped at an airport by undercover narcotics agents based on a drug courier profile. The officers asked to inspect his overnight bag, and when he refused, they told him he could not board the plane unless he complied. The defendant decided not to fly, but the officers still requested the bag, which he handed over. The police detained the bag overnight, conducted a dog sniff the next day, found heroin, and charged the defendant with unlawful possession.

The key legal issues are:

1. **Reasonable Suspicion and Detention**: The police had reasonable suspicion based on the drug courier profile, allowing them to approach and question the defendant. However, detaining him beyond a brief period or conditioning his ability to leave on surrendering his bag likely exceeded the bounds of reasonable suspicion.

2. **Voluntariness of Consent**: The defendant's decision to hand over the bag was not voluntary because the police implicitly coerced him by conditioning his ability to leave on compliance. This makes the consent invalid.

3. **Detention of the Bag**: Without probable cause, the police could not detain the bag overnight. Under *United States v. Place*, reasonable suspicion allows only a short detention for a dog sniff, not an extended period without probable cause or a warrant.

4. **Exclusionary Rule**: Since the police lacked probable cause to detain the bag overnight and the initial detention was likely unlawful, the evidence obtained from the search is tainted and should be suppressed.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Correct. The police did not have probable cause to hold the bag overnight, making the detention unreasonable.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Reasonable suspicion alone does not justify an extended detention without probable cause.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. While the police likely had no right to prevent boarding, the primary issue is the unlawful detention of the bag.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The issue is not the initial detention but the unlawful detention of the bag.

The motion to suppress will most likely be granted because the police did not have probable cause to hold the bag overnight.
