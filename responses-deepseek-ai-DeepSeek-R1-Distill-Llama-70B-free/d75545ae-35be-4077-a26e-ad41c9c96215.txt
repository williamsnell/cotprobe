Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

A 100-kg man jumps into a swimming pool from a height of 5 meters. It takes 0.4 seconds for the water to reduce his velocity to zero. I need to find the average force the water exerted on him. The options are from A to J.

Hmm, alright, let's think about the physics involved here. When the man jumps into the pool, he's going to have some initial velocity downward, right? But when he hits the water, the water exerts an upward force to decelerate him, bringing him to a stop. So I think I should use some kinematics equations here, maybe involving velocity, acceleration, and force.

Wait, the question is about average force. Oh right, Newton's second law, F equals mass times acceleration. But wait, I might need to find the acceleration first, or maybe use the impulse-momentum theorem. Because impulse is the change in momentum, which equals the average force multiplied by the time.

Oh yeah, impulse equals change in momentum. The formula is J = F_avg * Δt = Δp. And Δp is mΔv. So F_avg = (mΔv) / Δt.

Right, so I need to find the change in velocity first. Let me see, when the man jumps from 5 meters, what's his velocity when he enters the water?

Wait, to find the initial velocity upon entering the water, I can use the equation for free fall. The velocity when he hits the water is v = sqrt(2gh), where g is 9.8 m/s² and h is 5 m.

Calculating that: v = sqrt(2 * 9.8 * 5) = sqrt(98) ≈ 9.899 m/s. So approximately 9.9 m/s downward.

Wait, but the problem says it takes 0.4 seconds for the water to reduce his velocity to zero. So his initial velocity is 9.9 m/s downward, and final velocity is 0 m/s. So Δv is v_final - v_initial = 0 - 9.9 = -9.9 m/s. The negative sign indicates direction, which I'll have to consider for the force.

Now, the mass of the man is 100 kg. So the change in momentum Δp is mΔv = 100 kg * (-9.9 m/s) = -990 kg·m/s.

Impulse J is F_avg * Δt, where Δt is 0.4 seconds. So F_avg = Δp / Δt = (-990) / 0.4.

Let me calculate that: 990 / 0.4 is 2475. So F_avg would be -2475 N. Hmm, looking at the options, I'm not seeing 2475 exactly. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: -2000 N

B: 1200

C:2000

D:-2500

E:-3480

F:-1500

G:1000

H:500

I:980

J:3000.

So D is -2500 N, which is close to -2475. But wait, why isn't it exactly 2475? Oh wait, maybe I approximated the velocity wrong.

Wait, let me recalculate the initial velocity. Maybe I did it too quickly.

The formula is v = sqrt(2gh). Let me compute it more accurately. 2 * 9.8 is 19.6, multiplied by 5 is 98. So sqrt(98) is approximately 9.8994949366 m/s.

So Δv is approximately -9.8995 m/s. Then Δp is 100 kg * (-9.8995) = -989.95 kg·m/s.

Then F_avg = (-989.95) / 0.4 = -2474.875 N. Approximately -2475 N.

Looking back at the options, D is -2500 N, which is very close to -2475. But wait, maybe I should check if I used the correct signs. Because the force exerted by the water is upward, so the direction is opposite to the initial velocity (which was downward). So the impulse should be in the upward direction, making the force negative if I'm taking downward as positive.

Wait, let me clarify the directions. Let's say downward is positive. So the initial velocity is positive, and the final velocity is zero. So the change in velocity is -9.9 m/s. The impulse is negative, meaning the force is upward (since force is opposite to the direction of motion). But wait, the question asks for the average force the water exerts on the man. Water exerts an upward force, so in our coordinate system, that would be negative.

So the force calculated is -2475 N. The closest option is D: -2500 N. But wait, another thought: maybe I should have considered the man's velocity when he hits the water more accurately. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another approach: using work and energy. The gravitational potential energy converted into kinetic energy upon falling.

Wait, but the question is about the force during the 0.4 seconds. So maybe the first approach is correct. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial velocity isn't 9.9 m/s. Wait, let's compute it precisely.

v^2 = u^2 + 2gh. Since he starts from rest, u=0, so v= sqrt(2gh) = sqrt(2 * 9.8 *5) = sqrt(98) ≈9.899 m/s.

So that seems correct. Then the change in momentum is 100 kg * (-9.899) = -989.9 kg·m/s.

Divide by 0.4 s: F_avg = -989.9 / 0.4 ≈ -2474.75 N.

So approximately -2475 N. The options don't have this exact number, but D is -2500, which is 25 N off. Hmm, perhaps I should check if I'm using the right signs.

Wait, another point: the time of 0.4 seconds is the time to stop. So the average acceleration a is (v_final - v_initial)/Δt = (0 - 9.899)/0.4 ≈ -24.7475 m/s².

Then F = m*a = 100 kg * (-24.7475) ≈ -2474.75 N. Same result.

So the average force is about -2475 N. The options don't have that, but D is -2500 N. Perhaps the question expects an approximate value, and 2475 is closer to 2500 than to 2000 (option A is -2000). So I would choose D.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me think about the possibility of using the equation without considering the direction. Let me try calculating the magnitude.

Average force magnitude is 2475 N. The options include D as -2500, which is negative. Since the question asks for the force the water exerts on the man, which is upward, so in the opposite direction to his motion, so the force would be negative if we take downward as positive. So yes, the correct answer would be approximately -2500 N, which is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider significant figures. Let me see. The given values: mass is 100 kg (probably 3 sig figs), height 5 m (1 sig fig), time 0.4 s (1 sig fig). So the least number of sig figs is 1 (from 5 and 0.4). But 5 m could be considered as 5.0, which is two sig figs. Hmm, but 0.4 is one. So maybe the answer should be reported to one sig fig. But 2500 has two, 2000 is ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore sig figs and just choose the closest option.

Another thought: perhaps the initial velocity is taken as 10 m/s for simplicity, making calculations easier. If v =10 m/s, then Δv is -10. Δp= -1000. F_avg= -1000 /0.4= -2500 N, which is exactly option D.

Ah, I see. The problem might be using v²=2gh with g=10 m/s² to simplify calculations. Let me check that.

If g=10 m/s², then v= sqrt(2*10*5) = sqrt(100) =10 m/s. So that makes the calculation easier. Then delta v is -10 m/s. delta p is 100 kg * (-10) = -1000 kg·m/s. F_avg = (-1000)/0.4 = -2500 N. So that would exactly match option D.

So perhaps in the problem, g is taken as 10 m/s² for simplification. That would make the answer D: -2500 N.

Okay, so I think the correct answer is D.

To determine the average force the water exerts on the man, we use the relationship between impulse and momentum. Impulse is given by:

\[
J = F_{\text{avg}} \cdot \Delta t = \Delta p = m \cdot \Delta v
\]

Here, \( m = 100 \, \text{kg} \), \( \Delta t = 0.4 \, \text{s} \), and \( \Delta v = v_{\text{final}} - v_{\text{initial}} \). The man's initial velocity upon entering the water can be calculated using the kinematic equation for free fall:

\[
v = \sqrt{2gh}
\]

Substituting \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) and \( h = 5 \, \text{m} \):

\[
v = \sqrt{2 \cdot 9.8 \cdot 5} = \sqrt{98} \approx 9.899 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

Thus, \( \Delta v = 0 - 9.899 = -9.899 \, \text{m/s} \). The change in momentum is:

\[
\Delta p = m \cdot \Delta v = 100 \cdot (-9.899) = -989.9 \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

The average force is then:

\[
F_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} = \frac{-989.9}{0.4} \approx -2475 \, \text{N}.
\]

The closest option to this value is \( -2500 \, \text{N} \), which corresponds to option D. It is likely that the problem simplifies \( g \) to \( 10 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) for easier calculations, leading to \( v = 10 \, \text{m/s} \), \( \Delta p = -1000 \, \text{kg·m/s} \), and \( F_{\text{avg}} = -2500 \, \text{N} \). This matches option D exactly.

Thus, the average force the water exerts on the man is:

**D: -2500 N**
