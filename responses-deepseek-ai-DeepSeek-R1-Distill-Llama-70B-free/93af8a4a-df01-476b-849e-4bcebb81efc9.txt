Question:

After being passed over for a promotion, an aeronautic engineer became a whistleblower. He contacted a government agency to state that the company for which he worked was submitting false safety reports on newly built aircraft. When the company learned that the engineer was leaking this information to the government agency, he was fired from his job. Afterward, the engineer sued the company for wrongful termination of employment. During the discovery stage of litigation, the engineer was deposed by the company's attorney. In his deposition, the engineer stated that the company submitted false safety reports to the government agency to cover up structural defects in its aircraft. A pilot was injured when one of the company'sairplanes he was piloting crashed. The pilot asserteda strict products liability tort against the company. At thal, the pilot seeks to introduce into evidence portions of the engineer's deposition from his wrongful termination lawsuit against the company. Assume that the engineer is unavailable to testify at trial. Upon objection by the company, the trial court judge should rule the engineer's deposition testimony

Options:

A: admissible as former testimony.
B: inadmissible as hearsay within the business records exception.
C: inadmissible due to the engineer's unavailability.
D: admissible as a statement against interest.
E: admissible as a vicarious admission.
F: inadmissible, because the company did not have the opportunity to cross-examine the engineer on the liability issue for which the statement is now being offered.
G: admissible as a dying declaration.
H: inadmissible because the engineer's deposition is biased.
I: inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.
J: admissible as a statement of personal or family history.

Okay, let's try to figure out this evidence question. So, the scenario is about an aeronautic engineer who became a whistleblower. He reported his company for submitting false safety reports, got fired, sued for wrongful termination, and during his deposition, he stated that the company was submitting false reports to cover up structural defects.

Now, a pilot was injured because one of the company's planes crashed, and the pilot is suing under strict products liability. The pilot wants to use parts of the engineer's deposition testimony from the previous lawsuit. The engineer is unavailable for trial, and the company objects. The question is whether the deposition is admissible.

I remember that depositions can be used as evidence under certain conditions. Let's go through the possible options.

Option A: Admissible as former testimony. I think former testimony applies when the testimony was given at a prior proceeding, like a trial or hearing, and the witness is unavailable. But a deposition is a different situation. I'm not sure if deposition counts as former testimony for this exception. Maybe not, because depositions are more like prior statements.

Option B: Inadmissible as hearsay within the business records exception. Hmm, business records require that the record be made in the regular course of business, at or near the time of the event. A deposition is a legal document, not a business record, so this doesn't fit. So B is probably incorrect.

Option C: Inadmissible due to unavailability. But unavailability alone doesn't make it inadmissible; there are exceptions. So C might not be correct.

Option D: Admissible as a statement against interest. Statements against interest are admissible if they were against the declarant's interest when made. The engineer's statements in the deposition were that the company submitted false reports, which would be against his interest as an employee, potentially subjecting him to retaliation. But wait, when he made the statement, he was already fired and suing for wrongful termination. So maybe the statement was in his interest to support his own case. Hmmm, not sure. Maybe not a statement against interest because the statement was made during his own lawsuit, so it might have been self-serving.

Option E: Admissible as a vicarious admission. Vicarious admissions are statements by an employee concerning a matter within the scope of employment, during employment. But the engineer made this statement during his deposition in a lawsuit against the company, which was after he was fired. So he wasn't an employee anymore. Therefore, this doesn't fit the vicarious admission rule. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Inadmissible because the company didn't have the chance to cross-examine on the liability issue now. Wait, in the deposition, the company's attorney was present and could have asked questions. So the opportunity for cross was there. But if the deposition was taken in a different case, maybe the cross wasn't on the same issues as the pilot's case. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think that for deposition testimony to be admissible under the former testimony rule, the same parties must have had the opportunity to cross-examine. But in this case, the pilot wasn't a party in the earlier wrongful termination case, so the company's attorney was cross-examining in that context. So maybe the company didn't get a chance to cross on the specific points the pilot is using it for. So F might be a valid objection.

Option G: Dying declaration. The engineer isn't dead, so G is out.

Option H: Inadmissible because biased. I don't think bias alone makes it inadmissible. The judge might consider weight, but it's not a hearsay exception issue. So H isn't the right reason.

Option I: Inadmissible as hearsay not within any exception. If none of the exceptions apply, then it would be inadmissible. So if the deposition doesn't fit any exception, I would be correct.

Option J: Admissible as personal or family history. That doesn't make sense here. So J is out.

So, back to the main issue. The engineer's deposition is being offered by the pilot. It's hearsay because it's a statement made out of court, offered to prove the truth of the matter. So we need a hearsay exception.

The possible exceptions here could be former testimony or statement against interest.

Wait, the deposition was taken in a prior case. The engineer is unavailable. So under FRE 804(a), if the declarant is unavailable, certain exceptions apply. Let's think about whether the deposition falls under any of these.

FRE 804(b)(1) is former testimony. But former testimony applies when the testimony was at a trial, hearing, or other proceeding, and the party against whom it's now offered had an opportunity to develop the testimony through direct, cross, or redirect. Here, the deposition was in a different case, between the engineer and the company. The pilot wasn't a party there, so the company's attorney in that case would have been representing the company, which is the same as the defendant here. But the issue is whether the company had the chance to cross-examine on the specific matters now at issue.

Wait, in the prior case, the company's attorney took the deposition, so they had the opportunity to cross-examine the engineer. So the former testimony exception under 804(b)(1) requires that the party against whom it's offered (here, the company) had an opportunity to examine the witness. Since the company did conduct the deposition, they had that opportunity. But wait, the former testimony exception applies when the testimony was given in a proceeding. Depositions are not proceedings in the same sense as a trial or hearing. So maybe former testimony doesn't apply to depositions. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, there's another exception under 804(b)(7), which is for statements made by a party's agent or employee on a matter within the scope of employment and during employment. But the engineer was fired before making the statement, so that might not apply.

Wait, another angle: the engineer's statement in the deposition was that the company submitted false reports. If the company was the employer, and the statement was made during the employment (but wait, he was fired, so it's after employment). So maybe that's not applicable.

So perhaps the only applicable exception is if the statement is a statement against interest under 804(b)(3). But when the engineer made the statement, he was suing the company for wrongful termination. So his statement that the company submitted false reports would support his own case against the company. Therefore, it was in his interest to make that statement, not against his interest. So it might not qualify as a statement against interest.

If that's the case, then the deposition testimony doesn't fall under any hearsay exception. So it's inadmissible. So option I would be correct.

Wait, but what about the hearsay exception for former testimony? If the deposition was taken in a different case, but the same party (the company) was present and could cross-examine, then maybe it's admissible under the former testimony exception. Let me check the rules.

FRE 804(b)(1) says that former testimony is admissible if the witness is unavailable, and the party against whom it's offered had an opportunity to examine the witness. So, in this case, the deposition was in a prior case between engineer and company. The company had the opportunity to examine him through their attorney. Now, the pilot wants to use his prior testimony against the company. So the company is the same party, so they had the chance to cross. Therefore, it might qualify as former testimony.

Wait, but depositions are not considered "testimony" in a prior "proceeding." I'm not sure. Some sources say that depositions can be used as former testimony if the conditions are met.

So if that's the case, then option A would be admissible as former testimony.

But wait, the question says the company objects. So if the court decides whether it's admissible, and the company had the opportunity to cross, then it's admissible under former testimony.

Alternatively, if the deposition isn't considered former testimony because it wasn't in a trial, then the only other option is whether it's a statement against interest, which it's not, so it's inadmissible.

I'm a bit stuck between options A and I.

Another thought: the deposition was taken in a different case, but the same party (the company) was there. So the company had the chance to cross-examine. Therefore, under FRE 804(b)(1), the former testimony exception applies, making it admissible. So option A would be correct.

Wait, but option A says "admissible as former testimony." So if the deposition counts as former testimony, then yes.

Alternatively, some might argue that depositions are not "former testimony" because they're not from a trial. But I think that under the rules, deposition testimony can qualify as former testimony if the conditions are met.

So I'm leaning towards option A being correct.

But wait, another angle: when the engineer made the statement in the deposition, it was in his own lawsuit against the company. So the statement was made by a party to that litigation. But in this case, the pilot is a different party. So does that affect anything?

Hmm, maybe not, because the company is the same party in both cases.

So, putting it all together, I think option A is the correct answer. The deposition is admissible as former testimony because the company had the opportunity to cross-examine the engineer in the prior case, even though it was a deposition.

The question revolves around the admissibility of an engineer's deposition testimony in a pilot's strict products liability case against the company. The engineer, who was fired after whistleblowing, is unavailable for trial, and the pilot seeks to introduce portions of the engineer's deposition from a prior wrongful termination lawsuit. The company objects, and the trial court must decide whether the deposition testimony is admissible.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Admissible as former testimony**  
   Under Federal Rule of Evidence (FRE) 804(b)(1), former testimony is admissible if the witness is unavailable and the party against whom it is offered had an opportunity to examine the witness in a prior proceeding. Here, the company had the opportunity to cross-examine the engineer during the deposition in the wrongful termination case. Although depositions are not traditionally considered "testimony" from a trial, they can qualify as former testimony if the conditions are met. Since the company had the chance to cross-examine the engineer, this option is plausible.

2. **Option B: Inadmissible as hearsay within the business records exception**  
   The business records exception applies to records made in the regular course of business, not to deposition testimony. Since the deposition is a legal document, it does not qualify under this exception. This option is incorrect.

3. **Option C: Inadmissible due to the engineer's unavailability**  
   Unavailability alone does not make evidence inadmissible; hearsay exceptions can still apply. This option does not address the specific admissibility of the deposition testimony and is therefore incorrect.

4. **Option D: Admissible as a statement against interest**  
   A statement against interest under FRE 804(b)(3) must be against the declarant's interest at the time it was made. Here, the engineer's statement in the deposition was made during his wrongful termination lawsuit, where it served his interest to support his case. Thus, it was not against his interest, and this option is incorrect.

5. **Option E: Admissible as a vicarious admission**  
   Vicarious admissions apply to statements made by an employee within the scope of employment and during employment. Since the engineer was fired before making the statement in the deposition, this option is inapplicable.

6. **Option F: Inadmissible because the company did not have the opportunity to cross-examine the engineer on the liability issue for which the statement is now being offered**  
   The company had the opportunity to cross-examine the engineer during the deposition in the wrongful termination case. While the specific liability issue in the pilot's case may differ, the company still had the chance to question the engineer about the false safety reports. This objection is without merit, making this option incorrect.

7. **Option G: Admissible as a dying declaration**  
   The engineer is not deceased, so this option is inapplicable.

8. **Option H: Inadmissible because the engineer's deposition is biased**  
   Bias affects the weight of evidence, not its admissibility. This option does not address the hearsay issue and is therefore incorrect.

9. **Option I: Inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception**  
   If no hearsay exception applies, the deposition testimony would be inadmissible. However, the former testimony exception under FRE 804(b)(1) likely applies, making this option incorrect.

10. **Option J: Admissible as a statement of personal or family history**  
    This exception is irrelevant to the facts of the case, making this option incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The engineer's deposition testimony is admissible under the former testimony exception because the company had the opportunity to cross-examine the engineer during the prior wrongful termination case. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: admissible as former testimony.**
