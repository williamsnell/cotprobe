The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A man is the owner of record of a parcel of land designated as "A. " It is the highest of three neighboring properties on a mountain. The man's friend is the owner of parcel "B," which is situated lower than "A" on the mountainside. The man's cousin owns parcel "C," which lies below parcels "A" and "B" on the mountain slope. In 2000, the man who originally owned all three parcels of land constructed a private drainage system. This system consisted of an underground pipeline that extended across all three parcels of land. Sewage from parcel "A" drained through the system to a municipal sewer, which was located at the bottom of the mountain. In 2005, the man sold parcel "B" to his friend. The following year, the cousin purchased parcel "C" from the man. The deeds to the friend and the cousin did not contain any mention of the man's drainage system. Located on each of the parcels are large ranch-style homes occupied by the respective owners. From the standpoint of the friend and the cousin, thedrainage system would most likely be defined as a(an)

Options:

A: easement by necessity.
B: profit à prendre.
C: easement by implication.
D: easement in gross.
E: express easement.
F: license.
G: equitable servitude.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about easements, which I remember is a property law concept. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the scenario. There are three parcels of land: A, B, and C. The man owns A, his friend owns B, and his cousin owns C. A is the highest on the mountain, then B, then C at the bottom. 

In 2000, the original owner (who I think is the man, since he's the one selling the parcels later) built a private drainage system. It's an underground pipeline that goes across all three parcels. The purpose is to drain sewage from parcel A to the municipal sewer at the bottom of the mountain.

Then, in 2005, the man sells parcel B to his friend, and the next year sells C to his cousin. The deeds to B and C don't mention the drainage system. Now, each parcel has a large ranch-style home, occupied by each owner.

The question is, from the friend and cousin's standpoint, what type of easement is the drainage system?

I need to figure out the type of easement. Let me recall the types:

1. **Easement by Necessity**: Usually arises when a parcel is landlocked and needs access. It's based on necessity, like having no other way out.

2. **Profit à prendre**: This is the right to take something from the land, like cutting timber or mining. Doesn't seem to apply here because it's about drainage, not taking resources.

3. **Easement by Implication**: These are easements that are not explicitly stated in the deed but are implied based on the circumstances when the property was divided. They usually require that the easement was apparent and continuous when the division happened.

4. **Easement in Gross**: This is an easement that benefits a person or company, not attached to land. Like utility companies having easements over properties.

5. **Express Easement**: This is explicitly stated in the deed. But here, the deeds didn't mention it, so it's not this.

6. **License**: A personal right to use land, revocable. Not an easement, so probably not.

7. **Equitable Servitude**: More related to covenants running with the land, like in an HOA. Not directly about easements here.

8. **Easement Appurtenant**: Benefits a particular piece of land (the dominant estate) and burdens another (the servient estate). Must have two properties: dominant and servient.

9. **Natural Easement**: Based on the natural situation of the land, like water flow. Not sure, but this might relate to drainage.

10. **Prescriptive Easement**: Acquired through long-term use without permission. Doesn't fit because the system was installed by the original owner.

Now, let's apply this. The drainage system was built in 2000 by the original owner, who owned all three parcels at the time. He then sold B and C later. The system benefits parcel A by allowing drainage to the municipal sewer. But does it benefit the other parcels? Maybe not directly, but the system runs through all three.

Wait, the system starts at A and goes through B and C to reach the sewer. So A is the dominant estate because it needs the drainage. B and C are the servient estates because the pipeline runs through them.

When the man sold B and C, the question is whether the new owners (friend and cousin) are burdened by this easement. Since the system was in place before the sale, the easement would likely run with the land.

Since the man owned all parcels when he built the system, and it was used for drainage (apparent and continuous), I think this is an easement by implication. Because when he sold the parcels, the necessity of the easement for parcel A's use would imply that the easement exists for the benefited land (A) over the burdened lands (B and C).

Alternatively, could it be an easement appurtenant? Because it benefits A (dominant) and burdens B and C (servient). But the key here is how the easement was created. Since it was created before the sale, and the use was apparent, it's more likely an easement by implication. Easement by implication is based on the circumstances at the time the property was divided.

Easement by necessity requires strict necessity, like land being landlocked. Here, the drainage is necessary, but it's more about the system already being in place when the parcels were sold, so implication fits better.

So the answer would be C: easement by implication.
</think>

The question revolves around determining the type of easement that applies to a drainage system installed across three parcels of land (A, B, and C) before they were sold to different owners. The drainage system, built in 2000, benefits parcel A by allowing sewage to flow to a municipal sewer at the bottom of the mountain. The deeds to parcels B and C, sold in 2005 and 2006 respectively, did not mention the drainage system. The task is to identify the nature of the easement from the perspective of the current owners of parcels B and C.

To analyze this, several types of easements were considered:

1. **Easement by Necessity**: This applies when a parcel is landlocked and requires access. However, the drainage system does not involve physical access but rather the flow of sewage, so this does not apply.

2. **Profit à Prendre**: This involves the right to take resources from the land, which is irrelevant here as the case concerns drainage.

3. **Easement by Implication**: This arises when an easement is implied due to the circumstances at the time of the property division. Since the drainage system was installed before the parcels were sold and was apparent and continuous, this is a strong candidate.

4. **Easement in Gross**: This benefits a person or entity rather than a specific parcel of land. While the drainage system benefits parcel A, it is tied to the land, making this less likely.

5. **Express Easement**: This is explicitly stated in the deed, but since the deeds to B and C did not mention the drainage system, this does not apply.

6. **License**: A revocable permission to use land, which does not apply here as the drainage system creates a permanent burden on the land.

7. **Equitable Servitude**: Relates to covenants running with the land, which is not directly relevant to the drainage system.

8. **Easement Appurtenant**: Benefits a dominant estate (parcel A) and burdens a servient estate (parcels B and C). While this could apply, the key is how the easement was created. Since it was installed before the sale and was apparent, easement by implication is more fitting.

9. **Natural Easement**: Based on the natural flow of water, but this is not the primary factor in this scenario.

10. **Prescriptive Easement**: Acquired through long-term use without permission, which does not apply as the system was installed by the original owner.

The drainage system was installed before the parcels were sold, and its existence was apparent and continuous. This aligns with the criteria for an easement by implication, which is created when the circumstances at the time of the property division imply the necessity of the easement. Therefore, the drainage system would most likely be defined as an **easement by implication** from the standpoint of the friend and the cousin.
