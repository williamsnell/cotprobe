Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about natural monopolies and socially optimal pricing. Hmm, I remember from my economics class that natural monopolies are industries where one big company can supply the entire market more efficiently than multiple smaller firms. That's usually because of high fixed costs and economies of scale.

The question is asking what price the government should set to achieve a socially optimal price. I think the socially optimal price is where the benefits to society as a whole are maximized, meaning the point where the marginal cost equals marginal benefit. Wait, but in this context, marginal benefit is probably the demand curve, which represents the consumers' willingness to pay. So, if MC equals demand, that's the socially optimal point, right?

Looking at the options, option E says "the marginal cost curve intersects the demand curve." That sounds like it matches what I was thinking. Because when MC equals demand, we're producing the quantity where each additional unit adds as much benefit as it costs to produce it. That's efficient.

Wait, but wait. I also remember that for a natural monopoly, the government often uses cost-based regulations. There's something about average total cost. Oh right, sometimes they set the price where average revenue equals average total cost, which is the break-even point. But that's more for ensuring the company covers its costs without making excessive profits. That's called the fair-return price. But the question is about the socially optimal price, not just covering costs.

So, social optimality is about allocative efficiency, so MC should equal demand. Let me look at the options again. Option E is MC intersects demand, which would mean MC equals demand. That makes sense.

Wait, another thought: for a monopoly, the supply curve is the marginal cost curve. So, if supply is MC, then setting where MC intersects demand would be where supply meets demand, which in a competitive market is the equilibrium. But in a natural monopoly, the government wants to set the price where it's as if it's a competitive market. So that's probably why E is the correct answer.

Alternatively, option I says average total cost equals demand. That would mean setting the price at the point where ATC meets demand. But that's more about covering costs, not necessarily the optimal price for society in terms of resource allocation.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be option E: the marginal cost curve intersects the demand curve.

To determine the socially optimal price for a natural monopoly, the government should aim to maximize societal welfare by ensuring allocative efficiency. This occurs when the marginal cost (MC) of production equals the marginal benefit to consumers, which is represented by the demand curve. Setting the price at this point ensures that each additional unit produced provides as much benefit as it costs to produce, leading to an efficient allocation of resources.

Option E, which states that the price should be set where "the marginal cost curve intersects the demand curve," aligns with this principle. This is because MC equals demand at this point, achieving the socially optimal outcome.

Other options, such as setting the price where average total cost (ATC) equals demand (Option I), focus on covering costs rather than achieving allocative efficiency. Therefore, the correct answer is:

E
