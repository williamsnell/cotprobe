Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the sedimentation coefficient of the tobacco mosaic virus. Hmm, I remember that the sedimentation coefficient, S, is related to how fast a particle moves under centrifugation. I think the formula involves the velocity of the boundary, the angular velocity of the centrifuge, and maybe some conversion factors.

Wait, the formula I think is S = (v)/(ω² r), but wait, no, let me think again. I think the correct formula is S = (v) / (ω² r), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact terms. Oh wait, no, I think the formula is S = (v)/(a² r), where a is the angular velocity in radians per second. Or maybe it's S = v/(ω² r), where ω is the angular velocity.

Wait, another approach: The basic equation for sedimentation is S = (v)/(ω² r), where v is the velocity of the boundary, ω is the angular velocity, and r is the distance from the axis. But wait, no, I think I'm mixing up some terms. Let me recall. Oh right, the formula is S = (v) / (ω² r), but I need to make sure about the units here.

Wait, actually, I think the correct formula is S = v / (ω² r), but I should double-check. Alternatively, I've heard of the Svedberg equation, which relates S to other factors. The Svedberg equation is S = (v) / (ω² r), where v is the velocity, ω is the angular velocity, and r is the distance. But wait, no, I think another version of the equation might involve the acceleration due to gravity, but that doesn't seem right here.

Wait, maybe I should start by figuring out the angular velocity ω. The centrifuge is running at 10,000 rpm, which is revolutions per minute. To convert that to radians per second, since ω is in rad/s. So, 10,000 rpm means 10,000 revolutions per minute. Each revolution is 2π radians, so that's 10,000 * 2π rad per minute. 

Wait, so per minute. To get per second, divide by 60. So ω = (10,000 * 2π) / 60. Let me compute that. 10,000 divided by 60 is approximately 166.6667. So 166.6667 * 2π is about 333.3333 * π. So ω ≈ 333.333 * π rad/s. Let me compute that: π is about 3.1416, so 333.333 * 3.1416 ≈ 1047.2 rad/s.

Wait, but wait, let me calculate it more accurately. 10,000 rpm is 10^4 rpm. So 10^4 rpm = 10^4 * (2π rad) / (60 s) ) = (2π *10^4) /60 rad/s. Simplifying, 10^4 /60 is 10000/60 ≈ 166.6667. So 166.6667 * 2π = 333.3333 * π. Which is about 1047.197551 rad/s.

So ω is approximately 1047.2 rad/s.

Now, the velocity v is given as 0.454 cm/hr. Wait, but I need to make sure the units are compatible. The velocity in cm per hour. I should probably convert this into cm per second because the angular velocity is in per second.

So 0.454 cm/hr is equal to 0.454 / 3600 cm/s, because there are 3600 seconds in an hour. Let me compute that: 0.454 / 3600 ≈ 0.000126111 cm/s.

Wait, but wait, no. Actually, let me think again. The velocity v is given as 0.454 cm per hour. So to get cm per second, divide by 3600. So 0.454 / 3600 ≈ 0.000126111 cm/s. Alternatively, in meters per second, but I think using cm is fine as long as the units are consistent.

The distance r is given as 6.5 cm. So r = 6.5 cm.

Now, the formula S = v/(ω² r). But wait, let me make sure. I think the correct formula for the sedimentation coefficient is S = (v) / (ω² r), where v is the sedimentation velocity, ω is the angular velocity, and r is the distance from the axis. So plugging the numbers in.

So S = v / (ω² r) = (0.454 cm/hr) / ( (ω in rad/s )² * 6.5 cm )

Wait, but wait, because v is in cm/hr, and ω is in rad/s, so the units might not match. Hmm, that's a problem. Because the velocity in cm/hr needs to be converted to cm/s to match the time units of ω.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. I should convert v from cm/hr to cm/s. So 0.454 cm/hr = 0.454 / 3600 cm/s ≈ 0.000126111 cm/s.

So now, plug in the numbers:

v = 0.000126111 cm/s

ω ≈ 1047.2 rad/s

r = 6.5 cm

So S = (0.000126111 cm/s) / [ (1047.2 rad/s )² * 6.5 cm ]

Wait, let's compute the denominator first. (1047.2)^2 = ?

1047.2 squared: 1000^2 is 1e6, 47.2^2 is about 2227. So 1047.2^2 ≈ (1000 +47.2)^2 = 1e6 + 2*1000*47.2 + (47.2)^2 = 1e6 + 94,400 + 2,227.84 = around 1,096,627.84.

Wait, but let me compute it accurately: 1047.2 * 1047.2.

Let me compute 1000 * 1000 = 1,000,000.

1000 * 47.2 = 47,200; so 1000 * 1047.2 = 1,047,200.

47.2 * 1000 = 47,200.

47.2 * 47.2: let's compute 47^2 is 2209, and 0.2^2 is 0.04, and cross terms 2*47*0.2 = 18.8. So 47.2^2 = 47^2 + 2*47*0.2 + 0.2^2 = 2209 + 18.8 + 0.04 = 2227.84.

Now, adding all together:

(1000 + 47.2)^2 = 1000^2 + 2*1000*47.2 +47.2^2 = 1,000,000 + 94,400 + 2,227.84 = 1,096,627.84.

So (ω)^2 = (1047.2)^2 ≈ 1,096,627.84 rad²/s².

Then, the denominator is ω² * r = 1,096,627.84 * 6.5.

Let me compute that: 1,096,627.84 * 6 = 6,579,767.04, and 1,096,627.84 * 0.5 = 548,313.92. So total is 6,579,767.04 + 548,313.92 = 7,128,080.96.

So denominator is 7,128,080.96 cm·rad²/s².

Now, the numerator is v = 0.000126111 cm/s.

So S = 0.000126111 / 7,128,080.96.

Let me compute that. Let's write the denominator in scientific notation: approx 7.12808096e6.

So S ≈ 1.26111e-4 / 7.12808096e6.

Wait, wait, 0.000126111 is 1.26111e-4.

So 1.26111e-4 divided by 7.12808e6 is equal to (1.26111 / 7.12808) * 1e-10.

Compute 1.26111 /7.12808 ≈ 0.1768.

So 0.1768e-10 = 1.768e-11 s.

Wait, but looking at the options, option J is 1.76 × 10^-11 sec, which is very close to this number.

Wait, but let me double-check the computation because sometimes I might have made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. The formula is S = v/(ω² r), but I think I might have mixed up the formula. Another thought: the Svedberg equation is S = (v)/(ω² r), but wait, another source I remember says S = (v)/(a), where a is the centrifugal acceleration, which is ω² r. So yes, that's consistent.

So S is in seconds, as the units are seconds. Because v is in cm/s, ω² is in rad²/s², r in cm. So the denominator has (rad²/s²) * cm. So overall, S has units of (cm/s) / ( (rad²/s²) * cm ) ) = (1/s) * (s² / rad²) ). Wait, but rad is dimensionless, so the units become s²/(s²) → no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

But from the calculation, I get S ≈ 1.76e-11 seconds, which is option J.

Wait, but let me check the numbers again because the options include other possibilities. Let me recalculate the denominator.

Wait, v is 0.000126111 cm/s.

Denominator is ω² * r = (1047.2)^2 * 6.5.

(1047.2)^2 = 1,096,627.84.

Multiply by 6.5: 1,096,627.84 * 6.5.

Compute 1,096,627.84 * 6 = 6,579,767.04.

1,096,627.84 * 0.5 = 548,313.92.

Adding gives 6,579,767.04 + 548,313.92 = 7,128,080.96 cm·rad²/s².

So 0.000126111 cm/s divided by 7,128,080.96 cm·rad²/s².

Wait, but 0.000126111 cm/s is 1.26111e-4 cm/s.

So 1.26111e-4 / 7.12808e6 = 1.26111e-4 / 7.12808e6 = (1.26111 / 7128.08 ) * 1e-10.

Wait, wait, 7.12808e6 is 7,128,080, so 1.26111e-4 divided by 7.12808e6 is (1.26111e-4) / (7.12808e6) ) = (1.26111 / 71280.8) * 1e-10.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent. Let me compute 1.26111e-4 / 7.12808e6.

Which is (1.26111 / 7.12808) ) * 1e-10.

1.26111 ÷ 7.12808 ≈ 0.1768.

So 0.1768 * 1e-10 = 1.768e-11 s.

Which matches option J: 1.76 × 10^-11 sec.

Wait, but looking at the options, option J is 1.76e-11, which is very close. So the correct answer should be J.

But wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in converting rpm to rad/s.

10,000 rpm is 10,000 revolutions per minute. Each revolution is 2π radians. So per minute, that's 10,000 * 2π rad. Per second, divide by 60: (10,000 * 2π ) /60 = (20000π)/60 = (200π)/3 rad/s. Let me compute that more accurately.

200π/3 ≈ 200 * 3.1416 /3 ≈ 628.32 /3 ≈ 209.44 rad/s.

Wait wait, wait a second. Earlier I thought ω was about 1047 rad/s, but now I'm getting 209.44 rad/s. That's a big discrepancy. Where did I go wrong?

Oh no! I think I made a mistake in calculating ω.

Wait, 10,000 rpm. To convert to rad/s: 10,000 rev/min * (2π rad/rev) * (1 min/60 s) ) = 10,000 * 2π /60 = 200π/3 ≈ 209.4395 rad/s.

Wait, so earlier I had 1047 rad/s, which is about 5 times larger. That's a mistake. So I must have miscalculated earlier.

Ah, I see, I think I messed up the conversion. Because 10,000 rpm is 10,000/60 = 166.6667 Hz, but no, wait, no. Hz is cycles per second. So 10,000 rpm = 10,000/60 ≈ 166.6667 cycles per second, and each cycle is 2π radians, so ω = 166.6667 * 2π ≈ 333.3333 * π ≈ 1047.197 rad/s.

Wait, no, wait, no. Because 10,000 rpm is 10,000 revolutions per minute. So per second, it's 10,000 /60 = 166.6667 revolutions per second. Each revolution is 2π radians. So ω = 166.6667 * 2π ≈ 333.3333 * π ≈ 1047.1975 rad/s. So earlier calculation was correct. So ω is about 1047.2 rad/s.

Wait, but now I'm confused. Let me recheck: 10,000 rpm is 10,000/60 = approx 166.6667 rps (revolutions per second). Each revolution is 2π rad, so ω = 166.6667 * 2π ≈ 333.3334 * π ≈ 1047.1975 rad/s. So the initial calculation of ω was correct. So the denominator calculation of 7.12808e6 was correct.

So the S comes out to 1.76e-11 s, which is option J.

So the correct answer is J.

To calculate the sedimentation coefficient \( S \) of the tobacco mosaic virus, we use the formula:

\[
S = \frac{v}{\omega^2 r}
\]

where:
- \( v \) is the velocity of the boundary (in cm/s),
- \( \omega \) is the angular velocity (in rad/s),
- \( r \) is the distance from the axis of the centrifuge rotor (in cm).

### Step 1: Convert \( v \) from cm/hr to cm/s
The velocity \( v \) is given as 0.454 cm/hr. To convert to cm/s:

\[
v = \frac{0.454}{3600} \approx 0.000126111 \, \text{cm/s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \omega \) in rad/s
The centrifuge speed is 10,000 rpm (revolutions per minute). To convert to rad/s:
\[
\omega = \frac{10,000 \times 2\pi}{60} = \frac{20,000\pi}{60} \approx 1047.2 \, \text{rad/s}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \omega^2 \)
\[
\omega^2 = (1047.2)^2 \approx 1,096,627.84 \, \text{rad}^2/\text{s}^2.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the denominator \( \omega^2 r \)
The distance \( r \) is 6.5 cm. Thus:
\[
\omega^2 r = 1,096,627.84 \times 6.5 \approx 7,128,080.96 \, \text{cm} \cdot \text{rad}^2/\text{s}^2.
\]

### Step 5: Calculate \( S \)
Substitute the values into the formula:
\[
S = \frac{v}{\omega^2 r} = \frac{0.000126111}{7,128,080.96}.
\]

Performing the division:
\[
S \approx 1.768 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Final Answer
The sedimentation coefficient \( S \) is approximately \( 1.76 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{s} \), which corresponds to option **J**.
