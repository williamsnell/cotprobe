Okay, so I've got this question here about probability, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is: What is the probability of throwing a "six" with a single die? And there are several options to choose from, labeled A through I.

Hmm, let me think. I remember that when it comes to probability, the basic idea is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, I need to determine both for this scenario.

First, the die. A standard die has six faces, right? Each face has a number from 1 to 6. So when you throw it, each face has an equal chance of landing face up. That means the total number of possible outcomes here is 6. Got that down.

Now, the favorable outcome is throwing a six. Since the die only has one six, there's only one favorable outcome. So the number of favorable outcomes is 1.

Putting it together, the probability should be the favorable over the total, which is 1 divided by 6. So that's 1/6. Let me double-check that. Yeah, each number has an equal chance, so each has a probability of 1/6.

Looking at the options, option C is 1/6. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The die is fair, right? The question doesn't say anything about it being unfair or loaded. So each outcome is equally likely, so yes, 1/6 is correct. I don't think any of the other options make sense. Option A is 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2. That would be if there were three favorable outcomes. But we only want one, so that's not right. Option F is 1/3, which would be if there were two favorable outcomes, but again, no. So yeah, C makes sense.

The probability of throwing a "six" with a single die is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes (throwing a six) by the total number of possible outcomes. A standard die has 6 faces, so there are 6 possible outcomes. Since there is only one favorable outcome (throwing a six), the probability is 1/6. Among the given options, option C corresponds to 1/6.

Answer: C
