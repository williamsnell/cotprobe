Okay, so I need to estimate the zero-point entropy of NO. Hmm, I remember that zero-point entropy is the entropy that a substance has at absolute zero, which is due to the presence of multiple microstates even at that temperature. This usually comes into play when there's some disorder or multiple ways the molecules can arrange themselves, even when they're as cold as possible.

Wait, zero-point entropy isn't zero because of quantum mechanical effects, right? Like, even at absolute zero, the molecules can't all be in the exact same quantum state if they have some kind of disorder. So for molecules with different possible states, like different nuclear spin states or other forms of degeneracy, this would contribute to the zero-point entropy.

Now, NO is nitric oxide. I think it's a diatomic molecule. Oh wait, diatomic molecules can have certain symmetries. Nitrogen monoxide, NO, has an odd number of electrons? No, wait, nitrogen has 7 electrons, oxygen has 8. So 7 +8 =15 electrons in NO. So it's a molecule with an unpaired electron, making it a paramagnetic molecule. But how does that relate to entropy?

Wait, but for entropy, especially zero-point, it's more about the possible states the molecule can be in without any thermal energy. So maybe the spin states or something else. Oh, maybe it's about the spin isomerism or nuclear spin.

I remember that oxygen, O2, has a significant zero-point entropy because of its nuclear spin. O2 is a homonuclear diatomic molecule with a certain nuclear spin that leads to different possible states. Similarly, N2 has a different spin state. For NO, since it's a heteronuclear diatomic, maybe it behaves differently.

Wait, no, because NO isn't the same as O2. Let me think: for homonuclear diatomic molecules like O2 and N2, the Pauli exclusion principle affects their nuclear spin states, leading to different possible configurations which contribute to the entropy. But NO is not symmetric because N and O have different atomic numbers, so their nuclei aren't the same. So maybe the nuclear spin considerations don't apply the same way.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the electronic ground state. NO is a molecule with a certain multiplicity. Its ground state is a doublet, I think, because it has an unpaired electron. The multiplicity is 2S+1, where S is the spin. So S=1/2, so multiplicity is 2. That means the ground state is a doublet, with two possible states (m_s = +1/2 and -1/2). So that would contribute a degeneracy of 2.

Wait, the zero-point entropy comes from the number of possible microstates. So if each molecule can be in one of two states, then the entropy would be related to the number of ways the system can be arranged.

The formula for entropy from degeneracy is S = R ln(g), where g is the degeneracy. But wait, that's when all states are equally populated. So for each molecule, if there are g possible internal states, then the molar entropy is R ln(g).

Wait, but wait: the zero-point entropy is calculated using the internal partition function at zero temperature. So the partition function q would be the degeneracy, since all thermal contributions are zero. So for distinguishable particles, the entropy is S = R ln(q). But for indistinguishable particles, it's S = R (ln(q) + ...), but I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Alternatively, considering that for a system with degeneracy g, the entropy at zero K would be S = R ln(g), but since it's per mole, R is the gas constant. But wait, the gas constant R is 1.987 cal/(mol·K), approximately 2 cal/(mol·K).

So if the degeneracy g is 2, then S would be R ln(2) ≈ 1.987 * 0.693 ≈ 1.38 cal/(mol·K). So that would be approximately 1.38, which is option J.

But wait, let me make sure. If the molecule has a degeneracy of 2, like from electronic states, then the zero-point entropy is R ln(2) ≈ 1.38 cal/(mol·K). So that would be option J.

Alternatively, if NO has some other form of degeneracy. Wait, what about the nuclear spin? Nitrogen has a nuclear spin I=1 (for ^14N), and oxygen has I=0 (for ^16O). So in NO, the nitrogen's nuclear spin is 1, which has a degeneracy of 3 (m_I = -1, 0, +1). But since oxygen's I is 0, it doesn't contribute. So the total nuclear spin degeneracy is 3.

Wait, but wait! The overall wavefunction for the molecule must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. But NO is a heteronuclear molecule, so the wavefunction doesn't have to be symmetric or antisymmetric under exchange of nuclei, unlike O2 or N2. So perhaps the nuclear spin degeneracy doesn't impose any restrictions, so all possible spin states are allowed.

Wait, but then considering that, the nuclear spin degeneracy would be 3 for NO. Then the entropy would be R ln(3) ≈ 1.987 * 1.0986 ≈ 2.18 cal/(mol·K). But that's not one of the options, so maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the zero-point entropy is determined by the electronic degeneracy. Since the ground state is a doublet, with g=2, then S is R ln(2) ≈1.38, which is option J.

Wait, but is that the case? I think for molecules, the zero-point entropy is usually dominated by the nuclear spin degeneracy when it's present. But for something like NO, which is heteronuclear, and where the nuclei have different spins, perhaps the nuclear spin doesn't contribute as much as in the homonuclear case.

Wait, the zero-point entropy arises from the degeneracy in the ground state. For diatomic molecules, the main contributions come from electronic, vibrational, rotational, and nuclear spin degeneracies. At zero K, the vibrational and rotational modes are in their ground states, so their contributions are minimal. So the main contributions are electronic and nuclear spin.

In the case of NO, the electronic ground state has a degeneracy of 2 (doublet). So that contributes a factor of 2. If there's any nuclear spin degeneracy, that would multiply the total degeneracy.

Wait, but for NO, since the nuclei are different (N and O), the nuclear spin doesn't lead to any symmetry considerations. So the nuclear spin states are independent and don't affect the overall wavefunction symmetry. So for each molecule, the total degeneracy would be the product of electronic and nuclear spin degeneracies.

Nitrogen has I=1, so 3 states, and O has I=0, so 1 state. So the nuclear spin degeneracy is 3. So the total degeneracy is 2 (electronic) *3 (nuclear spin) =6.

Then the entropy would be R ln(6) ≈ 1.987 *1.792 ≈ 3.56 cal/(mol·K). But none of the options are near that. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. I remember that for O2, the zero-point entropy is about 2 cal/(mol·K), which is option A or H. Let me think: O2 has a triplet ground state (g=3) and nuclear spin I=0 for ^16O (so degeneracy 1). So the total degeneracy is 3. So the entropy is R ln(3) ≈ 2.18 cal/(mol·K). But wait, looking at the options, option A is 1.98, which is close. But I think O2's zero-point entropy is actually around 2 cal/(mol·K). So for NO, which has a doublet (g=2 for electronic), but what about the nuclear spin.

Wait, perhaps the nuclear spin doesn't contribute because the nuclei are different. So the degeneracy is just from the electronic state, which is 2. So the entropy would be R ln(2) ≈1.38 cal/(mol·K), which is option J.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: zero-point entropy can arise from the number of possible distinguishable orientations or states of the molecule. For example, in CO, which is heteronuclear, I don't think the zero-point entropy is significant because the nuclei are different, so each molecule is distinguishable in terms of orientation.

Wait, but for NO, perhaps the same applies. If the molecule is polar, then flipping it would result in a different molecule, so perhaps the rotational state doesn't contribute as much. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, maybe I should recall some actual values. I remember that O2 has a zero-point entropy of about 2 cal/(mol·K) because of its triplet electronic state and nuclear spin. N2 has a lower entropy because its ground state is singlet. Wait, no, N2's ground state is actually a singlet or triplet? Wait, nitrogen molecule (N2) has a ground state that is a singlet state because it has all electrons paired. So its electronic degeneracy is g=1. But wait, O2 has a ground state with two unpaired electrons, so it's a triplet state (g=3). So O2 has higher zero-point entropy.

Wait, but then what about NO? NO has an unpaired electron, so its electronic ground state is a doublet (g=2). So maybe for NO, the zero-point entropy is R ln(2) = 1.38 cal/(mol·K), which would be option J.

Alternatively, do other factors contribute? For example, the rotational states. But at zero K, the molecule would be in the lowest rotational state, which for diatomic molecules is J=0 or J=1, depending on nuclear spin. Wait, for NO, the rotational state depends on the nuclei. Since NO is a heteronuclear diatomic, the rotational wavefunctions don't have to be symmetric under exchange, so the rotational quantum number can be any integer. But at zero K, the lowest state is J=0. So the rotational degeneracy is 2J+1 =1. So that doesn't contribute to the entropy.

So the main contribution would be from the electronic state. So g=2, so S= R ln(2) = ~1.38 cal/(mol·K), which is option J.

Wait, but I thought that for homonuclear diatomics, the nuclear spin contributes because of the exchange symmetry. But for heteronuclear, that doesn't apply, so perhaps the nuclear spin degeneracy doesn't add to the entropy. So in NO, the only degeneracy is the electronic one.

So the entropy would be about 1.38, option J.

To estimate the zero-point entropy of NO, we consider the degeneracy of its ground state. Zero-point entropy arises from the number of microstates available to the system at absolute zero, which is determined by the degeneracy of the ground state. For NO, the ground state is a doublet due to the presence of an unpaired electron, resulting in a degeneracy factor \( g = 2 \).

The formula for zero-point entropy is:

\[
S = R \ln(g)
\]

where \( R \) is the gas constant (\( 1.987 \, \text{cal mol}^{-1} \text{K}^{-1} \)). Substituting \( g = 2 \):

\[
S = 1.987 \ln(2) \approx 1.987 \times 0.693 \approx 1.38 \, \text{cal mol}^{-1} \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

This matches option J. Other potential contributions, such as nuclear spin degeneracy, are less significant for NO because it is a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, and nuclear spin does not impose symmetry constraints on the wavefunction. Therefore, the dominant contribution to the zero-point entropy comes from the electronic degeneracy.
