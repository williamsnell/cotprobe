Question:

Two competing department stores have a radio whose cost is $10.82. Both stores advertise that they sell the radio on a 70% markup. However, store A bases the markup on the selling price, while store B bases it on the cost price. What is the selling price of the radio in the two stores?

Okay, so I have this problem about two stores selling a radio with a 70% markup, but they calculate it differently. Hmm, I need to figure out the selling prices for both stores.

Let me start by understanding what markup means. Markup is the amount added to the cost price to get the selling price. But wait, there are two ways to calculate it: based on cost or based on selling price. Oh right, that's the key here.

Store A uses markup based on the selling price. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says Store A bases the markup on the selling price, while Store B bases it on the cost price. Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, the question says Store A bases the markup on the selling price, and Store B on the cost. Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me read the question again.

The question states: Store A bases the markup on the selling price, Store B on the cost price. Because the question says, "Store A bases the markup on the selling price, while Store B bases it on the cost price."

Wait no, the question says: "Store A bases the markup on the selling price, while Store B bases it on the cost price." Oh right, that's correct. So the way they calculate markup differs.

So for Store A: Markup is 70% of the selling price. Wait, no, wait. Wait, when markup is based on cost price, the formula is Selling Price (SP) = Cost Price (CP) + Markup. And markup is a percentage of CP. So if markup is 70% on cost, then SP = CP * (1 + 70/100) = 1.7 * CP.

But in Store A's case, the markup is based on the selling price. So the markup is 70% of SP. Wait, no, that can't be right because if markup is a percentage of SP, then the formula would be different.

Wait, let me think. Normally, markup is added to the cost. So when a store says they have a 70% markup on cost, SP = CP + (70% of CP) = CP * 1.7.

But Store A is marking up based on SP. That means the markup amount is 70% of the SP. So, the cost is CP, and the markup is 0.7 * SP. So, SP = CP + 0.7 SP. Let me rearrange that.

SP - 0.7 SP = CP
0.3 SP = CP
So SP = CP / 0.3.

Wait, does that make sense? Let me plug in the numbers.

CP is $10.82.

Store A: SP = 10.82 / 0.3. Let me calculate that. 10.82 divided by 0.3. 0.3 times 36 is 10.8, so 10.82 / 0.3 is approximately 36.066..., so about $36.07.

Wait, that seems high. But let's make sure. So when the markup is based on SP, the formula is different. So Store A's selling price is higher than Store B's.

Store B's markup is based on cost, so it's the usual way. So Store B's SP is CP * (1 + 0.70) = 10.82 * 1.7. Let me calculate that: 10 * 1.7 is 17, 0.82 * 1.7 is approx 1.394. So 17 + 1.394 is 18.394, which is about $18.39.

So Store A's SP is about $36.07, Store B's is $18.39.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option J says Store A: $36.07, Store B: $18.39. Oh wait no, option J says Store A: $36.07, Store B: $18.39? Wait no, looking at the options:

Option J: Store A: $36.07, Store B: $18.39.

Wait, let me check the options:

Looking back:

Options:

A: Store A: $23.95, Store B: $18.39

B: Store A: $10.82, Store B: $7.57

C: Store A: $18.39, Store B: $23.95

D: Store A: $15.00, Store B: $20.00

E: Store A: $30.00, Store B: $25.00

F: Store A: $18.39, Store B: $36.07

G: Store A: $25.00, Store B: $30.00

H: Store A: $7.57, Store B: $10.82

I: Store A: $20.57, Store B: $25.72

J: Store A: $36.07, Store B: $18.39

So yes, option J is Store A: 36.07, Store B: 18.39.

Wait, but I thought Store A was the one with higher price because when markup is on SP, the price is higher. So that makes sense.

So the correct answer should be option J.

To determine the selling prices of the radio in both stores, we need to understand how each store calculates the 70% markup:

1. **Store A (Markup based on Selling Price):**  
   When the markup is based on the selling price (SP), the formula is:  
   \[
   \text{SP} = \frac{\text{Cost Price (CP)}}{1 - \text{Markup Percentage}}
   \]  
   Given the cost price (CP) is $10.82 and the markup is 70% of SP, the formula becomes:  
   \[
   \text{SP} = \frac{10.82}{1 - 0.70} = \frac{10.82}{0.30} \approx 36.07
   \]  
   Thus, Store A's selling price is approximately **$36.07**.

2. **Store B (Markup based on Cost Price):**  
   When the markup is based on the cost price (CP), the formula is:  
   \[
   \text{SP} = \text{CP} \times (1 + \text{Markup Percentage})
   \]  
   Given the cost price (CP) is $10.82 and the markup is 70% of CP, the formula becomes:  
   \[
   \text{SP} = 10.82 \times (1 + 0.70) = 10.82 \times 1.70 \approx 18.39
   \]  
   Thus, Store B's selling price is approximately **$18.39**.

From the given options, the correct answer is **Option J**, where Store A's selling price is $36.07 and Store B's selling price is $18.39.

**Answer: J**
