Okay, so I need to figure out the ergs loss per cycle using Steinmetz law. Hmm, Steinmetz law relates to the hysteresis loss in magnetic materials, right? I remember that the formula for hysteresis loss per cycle is given by W_h = η * B_max^(n) * V, where η is a material constant, B_max is the maximum flux density, and V is the volume. Wait, but I might be mixing up some variables here.

Wait, I think the standard Steinmetz formula is W_h = η * B_max^something * V. Oh right, the exponent is 1.6 for many materials, but the problem gives a specific η, so maybe I don't need to worry about the exponent? Or wait, in some cases, the formula is written as W = k * B^m * f * V, but when frequency isn't involved, perhaps it's just W = η * B_max^n * V.

Wait, the question states that η is 0.004 for sheet iron. And the maximum flux density is 8,000 gauss. Oh wait, I remember that in the CGS unit system, 1 tesla is 10^4 gauss, so 8,000 gauss is 0.8 tesla? Or maybe that's not relevant here because the formula uses the units as they are.

Wait, Steinmetz's original formula was for loss per cycle, and I think it uses B in gauss. So the formula is W = η * (B_max)^1.6 * V. Wait, no, wait: Steinmetz's formula as I recall is W = k * B_max^m * V, where k is a material constant, and m is typically around 1.6 to 2.0 for different materials. Alternatively, I've seen it written as W = η * (B_max)^n * V, perhaps with n being 1.6.

But wait, in the problem, η is given as 0.004. So maybe the formula they expect me to use is W = η * (B_max)^1.6 * V. Or is it W = η * (B_max)^2 * V? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another thought: Steinmetz's law is often written as P_h = k * f * (B_m)^n * V, where P_h is power loss (per unit time), f is frequency, B_m is max flux density, and V is volume. But since this is per cycle, not per second, maybe we can ignore the frequency because per cycle would mean W = P_h / f, which would eliminate the f. So then W = k * (B_m)^n * V.

But wait, the problem gives the value of η as 0.004. So perhaps η is the same as k in this formula, and n is a certain value. I think for sheet iron, n is about 1.6. So maybe the formula is W = η * (B_max)^1.6 * V.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck because I'm not entirely sure of the exact formula they're using here. Let me think. Another approach: perhaps in the form W = η * B_max^2 * V, but I'm not certain.

Wait, in the question, the options are in joules per cycle. Oh, but wait, ergs are different from joules. 1 joule is 10^7 ergs. So the answer needs to be in ergs per cycle, but the options are given in joules. Wait, looking at the options, they are all in joules per cycle. But the question asks for ergs loss per cycle. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Oh wait, perhaps I misread. Let me check the question again. Oh, wait, the question says "determine the ergs loss per cycle" but the options are given in joules per cycle. That's a problem. Alternatively, maybe the question actually wants the answer in joules but misstates it. Or perhaps the options are in ergs but labeled as joules. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the question has a typo, but for now, I'll proceed, keeping in mind the unit conversion.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses ergs. So, V is given in cubic centimeters, which is appropriate because 1 cm³ is 1 ml, but in terms of volume for magnetic calculations. So, if V is 40 cm³, then in the CGS system, that's 40 cm³.

So, let's proceed. Let me outline the steps:

1. Identify the formula to use. I think it's W = η * (B_max)^n * V, with n being 1.6 for sheet iron.

2. Plug in the values: η is 0.004, B_max is 8,000 Gauss, V is 40 cm³.

But wait, I'm not sure about the exponent. Maybe the formula uses B_max squared. Alternatively, perhaps the exponent is 1.6.

Wait, I think for Steinmetz, the exponent is typically 1.6 for many steels. So n=1.6.

So W = 0.004 * (8000)^1.6 * 40.

Wait, but the units might be an issue here. Let me make sure. Let's think in terms of CGS units.

In the CGS system, B is in Gauss, V in cm³, and the loss would be in ergs. So, yes, because 1 erg is 1 g·cm²/s².

But wait, what is the unit of η? Let's see: the formula W = η * (B_max)^n * V.

So, η would have units of ergs per (Gauss^n * cm³), perhaps. But maybe not necessary to get into that right now.

So let's compute numerically.

Compute (8000)^1.6 first.

Wait, 8000 is 8e3, and 8e3^1.6. Let me compute that.

Wait, 8^1.6 is approximately? Let's compute.

Log(8) = 0.9031, so log(8^1.6) = 1.6 * 0.9031 ≈ 1.445.

So 10^1.445 ≈ 27.88.

Because 10^1.4 is about 25.11, 10^1.45 is about 28.18, so 1.445 is around 27.8.

So 8^1.6 ≈ 27.8.

Now, 1e3^1.6 is (10^3)^1.6 = 10^(4.8) = 10^4 * 10^0.8 ≈ 10000 * 6.3096 = 63,096.

So 8e3^1.6 = 8^1.6 * (1e3)^1.6 ≈ 27.8 * 63,096.

Let me compute 27.8 * 63,096.

Compute 27 * 63,096 = ?

Wait, 27 * 60,000 = 1,620,000.

27 * 3,096 = 27*(3000 + 96) = 81,000 + 2,592 = 83,592.

So total 1,620,000 +83,592 = 1,703,592.

Then 0.8 * 63,096 = 50,476.8.

So 27.8 * 63,096 ≈ 1,703,592 +50,476.8 = 1,754,068.8.

So (8000)^1.6 ≈ 1.754e6.

Now, W = η * B^1.6 * V = 0.004 * 1.754e6 *40.

Compute 0.004 *1.754e6 = 0.004 * 1,754,000 = 7,016.

Then multiply by 40: 7,016 *40 = 280,640 ergs.

Wait, because 1 erg is 1 g·cm²/s², but the options are in joules. Wait, wait, 1 joule is 10^7 ergs.

So 280,640 ergs is 280,640 / 1e7 joules = 0.028064 joules.

That's approximately 0.0281 joules.

Looking at the options, option E is 0.0281 joules per cycle.

So the answer would be E.

To determine the energy loss per cycle in the given sheet iron core using Steinmetz's law, the formula is:

\[
W = \eta \cdot B_{\text{max}}^n \cdot V
\]

where:
- \( \eta = 0.004 \) (material constant for sheet iron),
- \( B_{\text{max}} = 8000 \, \text{Gauss} \),
- \( n = 1.6 \) (exponent for sheet iron),
- \( V = 40 \, \text{cm}^3 \).

### Step 1: Compute \( B_{\text{max}}^{1.6} \)
The value of \( B_{\text{max}}^{1.6} \) is calculated as follows:
\[
B_{\text{max}}^{1.6} = (8000)^{1.6} = 8^{1.6} \cdot (10^3)^{1.6}
\]
- \( 8^{1.6} \approx 27.8 \),
- \( (10^3)^{1.6} = 10^{4.8} \approx 63,096 \),
- \( B_{\text{max}}^{1.6} \approx 27.8 \cdot 63,096 = 1,754,068.8 \).

### Step 2: Compute the loss per cycle
Substitute the values into the formula:
\[
W = \eta \cdot B_{\text{max}}^{1.6} \cdot V
\]
\[
W = 0.004 \cdot 1,754,068.8 \cdot 40
\]
- \( 0.004 \cdot 1,754,068.8 = 7,016 \),
- \( 7,016 \cdot 40 = 280,640 \, \text{ergs} \).

### Step 3: Convert to joules
Since \( 1 \, \text{joule} = 10^7 \, \text{ergs} \):
\[
W = \frac{280,640}{10^7} = 0.028064 \, \text{joules}.
\]

### Final Answer
The energy loss per cycle is approximately \( 0.0281 \, \text{joules} \), which corresponds to option **E**.
