Okay, I'm trying to figure out this question about variance decomposition analysis in VARs. Hmm, I remember that VAR stands for Vector Autoregressive model. I think variance decomposition is a tool used to analyze the relationships between the variables in the model.

So, the question has four statements, and I need to determine which are true. Let me go through each one by one.

Statement i: Variance decompositions measure the impact of a unit shock to each of the variables on the VAR. Wait, I think I remember that variance decomposition is about how much each variable contributes to the forecast error variance of another variable. Oh wait, but maybe statement i is talking about impulse response functions instead? Because impulse responses do show the impact of a unit shock. Or maybe variance decomposition is related to that. I'm a bit confused here. I'll come back to this.

Statement ii: Variance decompositions measure the proportion of the forecast error variance attributable to each variable. Yes, that rings a bell. I think this is correct. Variance decomposition breaks down the error variance into parts caused by each variable's shocks. So ii is true.

Statement iii: The ordering of variables is important for impulse responses but not for variance decompositions. Oh right, in VAR models, the ordering affects the impulse response functions because of the Cholesky decomposition â€” the ordering determines the direction of causality. But for variance decomposition, I think it's also affected by the ordering because the way you orthogonalize the shocks depends on the order. Wait, no, wait. Or is variance decomposition order-invariant? I'm not sure. I recall that some decomposition methods might be sensitive to ordering, but others aren't. Or maybe variance decomposition is also order-dependent because it's based on the same orthogonalization as impulse responses. So if ordering matters for impulse responses, it might also matter for variance decompositions. So statement iii might be wrong because it says ordering doesn't matter for variance decomposition. Hmm, I'm a bit shaky on this. Need to think more.

Statement iv: It's usual that most of the forecast error variance is due to shocks to the variable itself. That makes sense. Typically, a variable's own shocks explain most of its forecast error variance because it's often the biggest driver of its own changes. So iv is true.

Now, going back to statement i. Variance decompositions are about forecast error variance proportions, not the impact of shocks. Wait, no, maybe statement i is correct because each variable's shock contributes to the variance. Or wait, no, variance decomposition shows how each variable's shocks explain the variance of another variable. So the impact is more about impulse responses. So statement i is incorrect? Or perhaps statement i is correct because it's talking about each variable's own shock. Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Statement i says it measures the impact of a unit shock to each variable on the VAR. Hmm, that sounds more like the impulse response, which traces the dynamic impact. But variance decomposition assesses the proportion of variance explained by each shock. So statement i might not be correct.

Wait, no. Wait, variance decomposition does look at the contribution of each variable's shocks to the variance of another variable's forecast error. So, for each variable, the shocks to each of the variables (including itself) contribute to its forecast error variance. So statement i says each variable's unit shock is measured in terms of impact. But maybe statement i is correct because variance decomposition is about the impact in terms of variance contribution. Or perhaps statement i is incorrect because it's the impulse response that measures the impact of a shock over time.

Hmm, perhaps I should clarify. Impulse response answers: if you give a unit shock to variable A, how does variable B respond over time? Variance decomposition answers: what proportion of the forecast error variance of variable B is due to shocks in A, B, etc. So statement i is talking about the impact of a shock, which is more like the impulse response. So statement i is incorrect. So i is false.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is about which statements are true. So, statement i: does variance decomposition measure the impact of a unit shock? Or does it measure the proportion of variance. So i is incorrect because it's the impulse response that measures the impact. So ii is correct, i is incorrect.

So now let's reevaluate each statement:

i: Incorrect. It's the impulse response that measures the impact of a unit shock.

ii: Correct. Variance decompositions measure the proportion.

iii: The statement says ordering doesn't matter for variance decomposition. But I thought ordering does matter because the Cholesky decomposition is order-dependent. So variance decompositions are sensitive to the ordering. Therefore, statement iii is incorrect because it claims ordering isn't important, but it actually is. So iii is false.

iv: Correct. Most variance is usually from own shocks.

So the true statements are ii and iv. So looking at the options, option E is (ii) and (iv) only. Option E is E: (ii) and (iv) only.

Wait, but what about statement iii again. Some sources say that variance decomposition is also order-dependent because the way you orthogonalize the shocks depends on the ordering. So the proportions can change with different orderings. So statement iii is incorrect because it says ordering isn't important for variance decompositions. So iii is false.

So overall, statements ii and iv are correct. So the correct option is E.

To analyze the question regarding variance decomposition in VAR models, let us evaluate each statement:

1. **Statement i**: "Variance decompositions measure the impact of a unit shock to each of the variables on the VAR."  
   This is incorrect. Variance decompositions measure the proportion of forecast error variance attributable to each variable's shocks, not the dynamic impact of a unit shock over time. The latter is the role of impulse response functions.

2. **Statement ii**: "Variance decompositions can be thought of as measuring the proportion of the forecast error variance that is attributable to each variable."  
   This is correct. Variance decomposition breaks down the forecast error variance of a variable into the contributions of shocks from all variables in the system.

3. **Statement iii**: "The ordering of the variables is important for calculating impulse responses but not variance decompositions."  
   This is incorrect. The ordering of variables affects both impulse responses and variance decompositions because the Cholesky decomposition, used to orthogonalize shocks, is order-dependent. Therefore, variance decompositions are also sensitive to the ordering of variables.

4. **Statement iv**: "It is usual that most of the forecast error variance for a given variable is attributable to shocks to that variable."  
   This is correct. Typically, a variable's own shocks explain the largest proportion of its forecast error variance, as a variable is often the primary driver of its own changes.

Based on this analysis, the correct statements are **ii** and **iv**. Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**E: (ii) and (iv) only.**
