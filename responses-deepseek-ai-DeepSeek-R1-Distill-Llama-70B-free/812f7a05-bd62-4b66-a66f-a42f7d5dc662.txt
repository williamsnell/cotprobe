Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about real estate law, specifically dealing with conveyances and future interests. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says that a man conveys property to his wife's cousin "to cousin and the heirs of his body." Then, he conveys the same property to his niece in fee simple. The question is asking what interest, if any, the niece has under modern real estate laws.

First, I need to understand the first conveyance. When the man conveys to the cousin "to cousin and the heirs of his body," that sounds like a fee tail. Fee tail is an estate that passes to the grantee's heirs of their body, typically creating a future interest in someone else if the grantee dies without heirs. But wait, under modern law, fee tail is often converted to a fee simple unless the grant specifically states it's a fee tail. So in most states today, if a conveyance is to someone and their heirs, it's usually a fee simple absolute, not a fee tail.

Wait, but the wording here is "heirs of his body." That's the traditional language for fee tail. However, many modern jurisdictions have abolished fee tail, so the conveyance would instead be a fee simple. But I'm not 100% sure about that. Alternatively, if the jurisdiction still recognizes fee tail, then the cousin gets a fee tail, and the man (the grantor) retains a reversion. Because in fee tail, if the cousin dies without heirs of their body, the property reverts back to the grantor or his heirs.

So, if the first conveyance is fee tail, then the cousin has a fee tail, and the grantor has a reversion. Then the man conveys the same property to his niece in fee simple. But wait, can he convey a fee simple if he's already given a fee tail? Because in a fee tail, the grantor's interest is a reversion, which is a future interest. So if he tries to convey the property again, does he have the authority?

Hmm, the first conveyance gave the cousin a fee tail. If the grantor then tries to convey the same property to his niece in fee simple, what happens? Well, the grantor only has a reversion at that point. So when he conveys to the niece, he can only convey what he has, which is the reversion. So the niece would receive the reversion, which is a future interest. But what kind of future interest?

If the cousin has a fee tail, then the grantor's reversion is a possibility of reverter. But wait, in fee tail, the future interest is a reversion in the grantor. So when the grantor conveys to the niece, he's giving her his reversion. So the niece gets a reversion.

But wait, the second conveyance is "to niece in fee simple." So does that mean the niece gets the fee simple? Or does she get the reversion?

Wait, maybe I should break it down:

1. First conveyance: "to cousin and heirs of his body." This is a fee tail in jurisdictions that recognize it, so cousin has fee tail, grantor has a reversion.

2. Second conveyance: grantor conveys "to niece in fee simple." Since the grantor only has the reversion, he can only convey that. So the niece gets the reversion, which is a future interest. But the second conveyance says "in fee simple," which is a present estate. So there's a conflict.

Wait, maybe the first conveyance is actually a fee simple. Because under modern law, the words "heirs of his body" could be interpreted as "heirs" generally, making it a fee simple. Some states have statutes that convert fee tail into fee simple unless specified otherwise.

If the first conveyance is a fee simple, then the cousin has fee simple absolute. Then the grantor, having already given away the entire estate, has nothing left to convey to the niece. So the second conveyance would be ineffective, and the niece gets nothing. That would make option A correct.

But wait, the initial conveyance said "to cousin and the heirs of his body," which traditionally is fee tail. So in states that haven't abolished fee tail, the cousin would have a fee tail, and the grantor retains a reversion. Then, the second conveyance to the niece would be of the grantor's reversion. So the niece would get a reversion, which is a type of future interest.

But what's the reversion in this case? Since the cousin has a fee tail, the grantor's future interest is a reversion. So the grantor conveys that reversion to the niece. But the second conveyance says "in fee simple," which suggests a present estate, not a future interest. That could be a problem because you can't convey a fee simple if you don't have it.

Wait, maybe the grantor only has a reversion, so he can't convey a fee simple. So the second conveyance would only transfer the reversion, which is a future interest, even if the conveyance says "fee simple." So the niece would have a reversion, but since the grantor only had a reversion to give, that's what she gets.

But the options don't have a reversion as an option. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A: Nothing, because already conveyed to cousin in fee simple.

B: Executory interest.

C: Fee simple.

D: Vested remainder.

E: Leasehold.

F: Partial right with cousin's heirs.

G: Contingent remainder.

H: Life estate.

I: Reversion if cousin has no heir.

So if the first conveyance was a fee tail, the grantor has a reversion. He conveys that reversion to the niece. So the niece has a reversion, which would take effect if the cousin dies without heirs of his body. So I think option I says she gets a reversion in case the cousin has no heir of his body at death. That sounds right.

But wait, some states have done away with fee tail, converting it to fee simple. So if the first conveyance is a fee simple, then the grantor has nothing left to give, and the niece gets nothing. So option A would be correct.

But the question says "under modern real estate laws and practice in most states today." So I need to know whether most states today still recognize fee tail or have converted it to fee simple.

From what I remember, many states have abolished the fee tail, so the conveyance to "A and the heirs of his body" would be a fee simple, not fee tail. So the first conveyance would give the cousin fee simple absolute. Then, the grantor has no remaining interest to convey. So when he tries to convey to the niece in fee simple, he can't, because he's already given away the entire estate. So the niece gets nothing, making option A correct.

Wait, but some sources say that in modern law, when the grant is to "A and his heirs," it's fee simple, but when it's "heirs of his body," it could still be fee tail unless the state has abolished it. So this is a bit tricky.

If the state still allows fee tail, then the first conveyance is fee tail, and the grantor has a reversion. Then the second conveyance would transfer the reversion to the niece, giving her a reversion (option I).

But if the state has abolished fee tail, the first conveyance is fee simple, and the niece gets nothing (option A).

The question is about "most states today." So which is more common?

I think the majority of states have abolished fee tail, so the first conveyance would be fee simple. Therefore, the niece gets nothing because the property was already conveyed in fee simple to the cousin.

So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but let me think again. If the first conveyance was a fee tail, the cousin's estate is determinable (fee tail), and the grantor has a reversion. Then the grantor conveys his reversion to the niece. So the niece has a reversion, which is a type of future interest. So when the cousin dies without heirs, the property goes back to the grantor, but since the grantor conveyed that interest to the niece, it would go to her. So option I says she gets a reversion in case the cousin has no heir at his death. That seems correct if the first conveyance was a fee tail.

But under modern law, if fee tail is abolished, the first conveyance is fee simple, so the niece gets nothing. So which applies here?

The question says "under modern real estate laws and practice in most states today." So I think most states have abolished fee tail, making the first conveyance a fee simple. Therefore, the niece gets nothing, so option A is correct.

But wait, another angle: the first conveyance is to the cousin and the heirs of his body. If that's fee tail, then the grantor has a reversion. He then conveys to the niece in fee simple. But he can't convey a better interest than he has. So he can only convey his reversion, which is a future interest. But the conveyance says "fee simple," which is a present estate. So does that mean the second conveyance is ineffective as to the present estate (since he already conveyed it), but he can convey the reversion.

Alternatively, the second conveyance could be considered as an attempt to convey the reversion, which is a future interest. So the niece would have a reversion, which is option I.

But I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to clarify:

Fee tail is an estate that ends when the grantee dies without heirs of their body. The future interest is a reversion, which goes back to the grantor. So if the grantor conveys that reversion to the niece, then the niece holds a reversion.

So in the first conveyance, cousin gets fee tail, grantor has a reversion. Then grantor conveys reversion to niece. So niece has a reversion, which is a type of future interest.

Now, the second conveyance says "to niece in fee simple." That could be a problem because the grantor is trying to convey the reversion, which is not a fee simple. But perhaps the conveyance to the niece is of the reversion, so she gets a fee simple absolute upon the termination of the cousin's estate. Or does she have a reversion?

Wait, the reversion is a future interest. So the niece would have a reversion, which is a type of future interest. So when the cousin's estate ends (if he dies without heirs), the property reverts to the niece.

In that case, the niece's interest is a reversion, which is a future interest, not a present fee simple. But the second conveyance says "in fee simple," which is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the grantor only had a reversion to give, so when he conveys to the niece, he's giving her that reversion. So the niece's interest is a reversion, which is option I.

So if the first conveyance is fee tail, the answer is I. If it's fee simple, the answer is A.

But under modern law, most states treat "heirs of his body" as fee simple, so the answer would be A.

Wait, but wait again. Some states have statutes that say that any conveyance that would create a fee tail is instead a fee simple. So in those states, the first conveyance is fee simple, and the niece gets nothing. So the answer would be A.

But other states might still allow fee tail, so the answer would be I.

The question is about "most states today," so I think the majority have abolished fee tail, making the first conveyance a fee simple. Therefore, the niece gets nothing, so option A is correct.

But I'm a bit unsure because the wording "heirs of his body" is classic fee tail language. Maybe in modern law, that's still treated as fee tail unless the state has abolished it.

Wait, I think the Uniform Probate Code and various state laws have done away with fee tail, so the first conveyance would be fee simple. Thus, the answer is A.

Alternatively, if the state still recognizes fee tail, then the answer is I.

But since the question is about "most states," I think the answer is A.
</think>

Under modern real estate laws and practice in most states today, the first conveyance to the cousin "to cousin and the heirs of his body" is analyzed as follows: 

1. Traditionally, this language creates a fee tail, but many jurisdictions have abolished fee tail, converting such conveyances into a fee simple absolute unless explicitly stated otherwise. 
2. If the jurisdiction has abolished fee tail, the cousin receives a fee simple absolute, and the grantor retains no interest to convey further. 
3. The second conveyance to the niece in fee simple would therefore be ineffective, as the grantor has already transferred the entire estate to the cousin. In this case, the niece would receive nothing.

Given that the question specifies "most states today," it is reasonable to assume that fee tail has been abolished in the relevant jurisdiction. Consequently, the first conveyance is treated as a fee simple absolute, leaving the grantor with no interest to convey to the niece. 

Thus, the correct answer is:

**A: The conveyance gives the niece nothing because the property was already conveyed in fee simple to his wife's cousin.**
