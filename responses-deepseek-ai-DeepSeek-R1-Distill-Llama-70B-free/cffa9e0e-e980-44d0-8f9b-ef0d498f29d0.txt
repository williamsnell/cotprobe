Question:

Berg offered to sell a parcel of land to Jones for $75,000 cash. The offer was in writing on March 1 and made by sending an e-mail to Jones' web site. Jones responded by mailing a letter on March 10 which stated "I accept but would like to request that I can pay $25,000 in three equal installments over the next three years." Berg received the letter on March 15. A contract was

Options:

A: Not formed because the addition of the three year request was, in effect, a rejection.
B: Formed on March 10.
C: Formed on March 1.
D: Not formed because Jones' response was a counter-offer.
E: Not formed because the installment request constitutes a new offer.
F: Formed on March 15, but not binding due to the installment request.
G: Not formed because Jones' addition of the three year payment request was a condition that Berg had to agree should be included.
H: Formed on Match 15.
I: Formed but invalid because the offer was made via e-mail.
J: Not formed because Jones' response was not immediate.

Okay, so I've got this question about contract formation, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what I remember from my studies.

Alright, the scenario is Berg offering to sell land to Jones for $75,000 cash. The offer was made via email on March 1. Then Jones responds by mailing a letter on March 10, saying he accepts but wants to pay $25k in three installments over three years. Berg gets this letter on March 15.

The question is whether a contract was formed and when. The options are from A to J.

Hmm, I think the key here is understanding the offer and acceptance process in contract law. So, an offer is a promise to do something in exchange for performance, and acceptance is agreeing to those terms. But sometimes, when someone purports to accept but changes the terms, it's not really an acceptance—it's a counter-offer, which would reject the original offer.

In this case, Berg's offer was for $75k cash. Jones says he accepts but wants to pay only $25k over three years. So he's changing the payment terms. That doesn't seem like a straightforward acceptance; it's adding a new condition.

Wait, but wait—let me think. The original offer was for cash, so Jones is changing that term. Under the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) for goods, there's something called the "battle of the forms," but I'm not sure if this situation involves goods or real estate. Since it's a parcel of land, it's real estate, so common law applies, not UCC.

Under common law, if the offeree changes the terms in their acceptance, it's a counter-offer, which means the original offer is rejected. So Jones' response on March 10 isn't an acceptance; it's a new offer. Therefore, no contract is formed when Jones sends that letter.

Wait, but when does the offer get accepted? Or is it that the offer gets rejected and a counter-offer is made? So Berg's original offer would have to be accepted as is for a contract to form. Since Jones didn't do that, there's no contract.

Looking at the answer options, let's go through them:

Option A says not formed because the addition was a rejection. That seems possible because changing terms can be a rejection.

Option B says formed on March 10, which is when Jones sent the letter. But if that letter wasn't a valid acceptance, then no contract on that date.

Option D says not formed because it's a counter-offer. That's another way to look at it. Jones' response was a counter-offer, so the original offer is terminated, and there's no contract.

Option E says not formed because the installment is a new offer. That's similar to D.

So I'm a bit torn between A, D, and E. Let me clarify the concepts.

In contract law, when an offeree responds with additional terms, it's considered a counter-offer, which has the effect of rejecting the original offer. So the original offer is no longer on the table unless the offeror agrees to the new terms.

So in this case, Jones' letter on March 10 is a counter-offer. Berg's offer was on March 1. So when Jones sends a counter-offer, Berg's offer is no longer open unless Berg accepts the counter-offer.

But did a contract form when Jones sent the counter-offer? No, because a counter-offer doesn't accept the original offer. So no contract was formed.

Looking again at the options:

Option A: Not formed because addition is a rejection. That's correct because the addition changes the terms, acting as a rejection.

Option D: Not formed because it's a counter-offer. That's also correct because a counter-offer doesn't accept the original terms.

Wait, so both A and D could be correct. But let me think about the exact reasoning.

Option A says the addition was a rejection. So Jones' response was a rejection because he added a condition. Option D says it's a counter-offer. So is a counter-offer considered a rejection, or is it a new offer?

I think a counter-offer is both a rejection of the original offer and a new offer. So when Jones sends the counter-offer, the original offer is rejected, and a new offer is made. So in that case, whether it's considered a rejection (A) or a counter-offer (D), the result is the same: no contract formed.

Wait, but the options are mutually exclusive. So which one is the correct reasoning?

In the context of the question, the issue is whether a contract was formed. Since Jones didn't accept the original offer, no contract. The reason is that his response was a counter-offer, which terminates the original offer. So the answer would be either A or D.

Wait, let's check the exact option wording.

Option A: Not formed because the addition of the three-year request was, in effect, a rejection.

Option D: Not formed because Jones' response was a counter-offer.

So both could be correct, but the reasoning might differ slightly.

Another point: the original offer was for cash payment. Jones wants to pay in installments, which is a material change. Under common law, any material change in the terms by the offeree constitutes a counter-offer, which means the original offer is rejected.

So, when Jones sends his letter on March 10, that's a counter-offer. Therefore, the original offer is no longer open. So Berg's offer is revoked by Jones' counter-offer. Thus, no contract was formed.

So looking back at the options, options A, D, E, and G are possibilities.

Option E says it's a new offer. Well, a counter-offer is a type of new offer, so E is similar to D.

Wait, but the question is about whether a contract was formed. So if Jones' response was a counter-offer, then the original offer isn't accepted, so no contract. So the contract isn't formed because the response wasn't an acceptance but a counter-offer.

So the correct answer would be either D or E.

Wait, but I think D is more accurate because a counter-offer is when the offeree responds with different terms, which terminates the original offer. So the answer would be D.

Wait another thought: under the UCC, even if the acceptance is by adding terms, it can still be an acceptance, but under common law, it's a counter-offer. Since this is real estate, it's under common law. So the response is a counter-offer, so no contract.

So the correct answer is D: Not formed because Jones' response was a counter-offer.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. The offer was made via email, and the response was via mail. Does that affect anything? I don't think so because the method of communication doesn't affect whether it's an acceptance or a counter-offer.

So putting it all together, the correct answer is D.

The question revolves around whether a contract was formed between Berg and Jones based on the offer and response. Berg offered to sell land for $75,000 cash via email on March 1. Jones responded by mailing a letter on March 10, stating acceptance but requesting to pay $25,000 in three installments over three years. Berg received this letter on March 15.

Under common law, an acceptance must mirror the terms of the offer. If the offeree changes the terms, it constitutes a counter-offer, which rejects the original offer and terminates it. In this case, Jones' request to pay in installments materially altered the payment terms of Berg's original offer. Therefore, Jones' response was not an acceptance but a counter-offer, which means no contract was formed.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Correct in stating that the addition of the installment request acted as a rejection, but the reasoning is less precise compared to Option D.
- **Option B**: Incorrect because a contract cannot form on March 10, as Jones' response was not a valid acceptance.
- **Option C**: Incorrect because no contract was formed on March 1.
- **Option D**: Correct because Jones' response was a counter-offer, which rejected the original offer and terminated it.
- **Option E**: Similar to D but less specific. While the installment request could be seen as a new offer, the precise term "counter-offer" better fits the scenario.
- **Option F**: Incorrect because no contract was formed, regardless of the installment request.
- **Option G**: Incorrect because the addition of terms does not necessarily require Berg's agreement; it simply constitutes a counter-offer.
- **Option H**: Incorrect because no contract was formed on March 15.
- **Option I**: Incorrect because the method of communication (email) does not invalidate the offer.
- **Option J**: Incorrect because the timing of the response does not affect the analysis.

The most accurate answer is **Option D**, as it correctly identifies that Jones' response was a counter-offer, which prevented the formation of a contract.

**Answer: D**
