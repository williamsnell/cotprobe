Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the correct Fourier cosine series representation for a given function f(x) defined on the interval 0 ≤ x ≤ π. The function f(x) is 0 when x is between 0 and π/2, and 1 when x is between π/2 and π. Hmm, I remember that Fourier series can represent such piecewise functions as a sum of sines and cosines, but since the function is defined on 0 to π and we're looking for a cosine series, I think this might involve extending the function as an even function or something like that.

Wait, right, the Fourier cosine series usually comes into play when we extend a function into an even function. So for x in [0, π], if we want a cosine series, we can consider the function extended as even about x=0. But in this case, the function is defined from 0 to π, and perhaps the series is constructed over that interval with only cosine terms.

I recall that the general form of the Fourier series in terms of cosines for a function f(x) on [0, L] is f(x) = a0/2 + sum from n=1 to infinity of an cos(nπx/L), where an are the Fourier cosine coefficients. In this case, L would be π, so the terms would involve cos(n x), since L=π makes the argument nπx/π = nx.

So, the function f(x) is 0 for x in [0, π/2) and 1 for x in (π/2, π]. To find the Fourier cosine series, I need to compute the coefficients a0 and an.

The formula for a0 is (2/π) times the integral of f(x) from 0 to π. But wait, since we're doing a cosine series, I think the formula is a0 = (2/π) ∫0^π f(x) dx. And an would be (2/π) ∫0^π f(x) cos(nx) dx.

Let me compute a0 first. The integral of f(x) from 0 to π is the integral from 0 to π/2 of 0 dx plus the integral from π/2 to π of 1 dx. So that's 0 + (π - π/2) = π/2. Therefore, a0 = (2/π) * (π/2) ) = 1. So a0 is 1, but wait, the general form for the Fourier series includes a0/2. So in the series, the a0 term would be (1)/2.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Because for the Fourier series expressed as a sum of cosines, the formula is f(x) = (a0/2) + sum (an cos(nx)). So if a0 is 1, then a0/2 is 1/2. So the first term in the series would be 1/2.

Now for the an coefficients. Each an is (2/π) ∫0^π f(x) cos(nx) dx. Since f(x) is 0 on [0, π/2) and 1 on (π/2, π], the integral becomes (2/π) times the integral from π/2 to π of cos(nx) dx.

Computing that integral: ∫ cos(nx) dx from π/2 to π. The antiderivative of cos(nx) is (1/n) sin(nx). So evaluating from π/2 to π:

(1/n)[sin(nπ) - sin(n π/2)].

Wait, let's think about sin(nπ). That's zero for all integer n. Because sin(kπ)=0 for any integer k. So the first term is zero. The second term is sin(n π/2). So the integral becomes (1/n) [0 - sin(n π/2)] = - sin(n π/2) / n.

So putting this into an: an = (2/π) * [ - sin(n π/2) / n ] * (π/2 to π) integral. Wait, no. Wait, wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me go through it again.

Wait, the integral from π/2 to π of cos(nx) dx is [ (1/n) sin(nx) ] evaluated from π/2 to π.

At x=π: sin(nπ) = 0.

At x=π/2: sin(n π/2).

So the integral is (1/n)(0 - sin(n π/2)) = - sin(n π/2)/n.

So an = (2/π) * ( - sin(n π/2 ) / n ) for n ≥ 1.

Wait, but wait: the integral is from π/2 to π. So the integral is (1/n)(sin(n π) - sin(n π/2)) = (0 - sin(n π/2))/n = - sin(n π/2)/n.

So an = (2/π) * [ - sin(n π/2) / n ].

But wait, no. Wait, the integral is (2/π) * [ ∫ (π/2 to π) cos(nx) dx ].

So an = (2/π) * [ - sin(n π/2) / n ].

Hmm, but this is for each n starting from 1 to infinity.

Now, let's think about sin(n π/2). For integer n, sin(n π/2) cycles through 0, 1, 0, -1, etc., depending on n mod 4.

So for n=1: sin(π/2)=1

n=2: sin(π)=0

n=3: sin(3π/2)= -1

n=4: sin(2π)=0

n=5: sin(5π/2)=1, and so on.

So the pattern is that for even n, sin(n π/2) is zero. For odd n, it alternates between 1 and -1.

Let me write n as 2k+1, where k starts from 0. So n is odd when n=2k+1.

So sin(n π/2) = sin( (2k+1) π/2 ) = (-1)^k.

Therefore, for even n, an is zero, so only odd terms contribute.

So an can be written as (2/π) * [ - ( (-1)^k ) / (2k+1) ), but wait, let me check.

Wait, when n=2k+1, an = (2/π) * [ - sin( (2k+1) π/2 ) / (2k+1) ) ].

But sin( (2k+1) π/2 ) = (-1)^k, as I said.

So an = (2/π) * [ - ( (-1)^k ) / (2k+1) ) ].

Wait, but let's plug in:

sin(n π/2) = sin( (2k+1) π/2 ) = (-1)^k.

So,

an = (2/π) * [ - ( (-1)^k ) / (2k+1) ) ]

Which simplifies to (2/π) * [ (-1)^{k+1} ) / (2k+1) )

But wait, let's compute this again.

Wait, the integral is from π/2 to π of cos(nx) dx. So when n is even, say n=2m, then sin(n π/2) = sin(m π) = 0. So an becomes zero for even n. So only odd n contribute.

Thus, for n = 2k+1 (k starts at 0), sin(n π/2) = (-1)^k.

So an = (2/π) * ( - ( (-1)^k ) / (2k+1) )

Which is (2/π) * ( (-1)^{k+1} ) / (2k+1 )

So, combining this, the Fourier series is:

f(x) = a0/2 + sum_{n=1}^∞ an cos(n x)

We found a0 = 1, so a0/2 = 1/2.

Then, the sum becomes sum_{k=0}^∞ [ (2/π) * ( (-1)^{k+1} ) / (2k+1) ) ] cos( (2k+1) x )

Wait, because n=2k+1, so cos(nx) = cos( (2k+1)x ). So the sum is over k from 0 to infinity.

So putting it all together, f(x) = 1/2 + sum_{k=0}^∞ [ (2/π) * ( (-1)^{k+1} ) / (2k+1) ) ] cos( (2k+1)x )

Alternatively, this can be written as:

f(x) = 1/2 - (2/π) sum_{k=0}^\infty [ (-1)^k / (2k+1) ) ] cos( (2k+1) x )

Because (-1)^{k+1} = - (-1)^k.

So, the series becomes:

1/2 - (2/π) sum_{k=0}^\infty [ (-1)^k cos( (2k+1)x ) / (2k+1) )

Hmm, now looking at the options, let's see which one matches.

Option A: (1/2) - (2/π) sum_n=0^infty (-1)^n [ sin(n) / (2n +1) ]

Wait, that's using sin(n), which doesn't make sense because n is an integer, and sin(n) is just a number. Plus, in our expression, we have cos((2k+1)x), so the argument is (2n+1)x, and the denominator is (2n+1). But in option A, the numerator is sin(n), which is a constant, but in our case, the numerator is cos((2n+1)x).

So option A is incorrect.

Option B: (1/2) - (2/π) sum_n=1^infty (-1)^n [ cos(2n) / (2n + 1) ]

Hmm, the denominator is 2n+1, and the numerator is cos(2n), but in our case, we have cos( (2k+1)x ), so this doesn't match.

Option C: (1/2) - (2/pi) sum_n=0^infty (-1)^n [ sin(2n+1) / (2n+1) ]

Again, sin(2n+1) is a number, but our series involves cos((2n+1)x). So no match.

Option D: (1/2) - (1/pi) sum_n=0^infty (-1)^n [ cos(n) / n ]

Wait, the denominator is n, but in our case, it's 2n+1. Also, the numerator is cos(n), but in our case, it's cos( (2n+1)x ). So no match.

Option E: (1/2) - (2/pi) sum_n=0^infty (-1)^n [ tan(2n+1) / (2n+1) ]

Tan is a function, and here it's evaluated at (2n+1), which is a number. So this doesn't make sense in the context of a series involving x.

Option F: (1/2) - (2/pi) sum_n=0^infty (-1)^n [ cos(2n+1) / (2n+1) ]

Wait, but in our series, the argument is (2n+1)x, so cos( (2n+1)x ), but this option has cos(2n+1), which is a number, not a function of x. So that's incorrect.

Option G: (1/2) + (2/pi) sum_n=1^infty (-1)^n [ cos(2n) / (2n) ]

Hmm, the denominator is 2n, and the numerator is cos(2n), which again doesn't match our case where we have cos( (2n+1)x ) and denominator (2n+1). So not matching.

Option H: (1/2) - (2/pi) sum_n=0^infty [ cos(2n+1) / (2n) ]

Wait, denominator is 2n, which is different, and the numerator is cos(2n+1), which is a number. So no.

Option I: (1/2) - (4/pi) sum_n=0^infty (-1)^n [ sin(2n) / (2n + 1) ]

Here, sin(2n) is a number, and the denominator is 2n+1, but in our series, we have cos( (2n+1)x ), which is a function of x. So this doesn't match.

Option J: (1/2) - (2/pi) sum_n=0^infty (-1)^n [ cos(2n+1) / (2n+2) ]

Again, the numerator is cos(2n+1), which is a number, and the denominator is 2n+2, which is different from our case of 2n+1.

Wait, none of the options seem to match what I derived. Did I make a mistake?

Let me double-check my calculation. So I found that f(x) is represented as 1/2 minus a sum involving cos((2n+1)x) terms.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the sum. Let me think again about the series.

The sum is sum_{k=0}^\infty [ (-1)^k cos( (2k+1)x ) / (2k+1) ) ], multiplied by (2/pi).

So the general term is [ (-1)^k cos( (2k+1)x ) ] / (2k+1), and the sum starts at k=0, so n=2k+1 goes 1,3,5,...

But none of the options have cos( (2k+1)x ), except perhaps option F, but there the argument is 2n+1, which is a number, not a function of x.

Wait, no, looking again, option F is written as cos(2n +1), which is a number, not a function of x. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the computation of an. Let me try another approach.

Wait, the function f(x) is 0 on [0, π/2) and 1 on (π/2, π]. So when extending as a cosine series, perhaps the function is extended as an even function about x=0, but defined on [-π, π]. But wait, the problem says to represent f(x) in 0 ≤ x ≤ π, so it's a half-range expansion, using only cosine terms. So yes, the formula would be f(x) = sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n cos(n x), where a_n are the Fourier cosine coefficients.

Wait, perhaps I should compute a0 and an again more carefully.

a0 is (2/pi) * integral from 0 to pi of f(x) dx.

Which is (2/pi) * [ integral from 0 to pi/2 of 0 dx + integral from pi/2 to pi of 1 dx ].

That's (2/pi) * (pi/2) ) = (2/pi)*(pi/2) = 1.

So a0 is 1. Then, the first term is a0/2, which is 1/2.

Now, an for n ≥ 1 is (2/pi) * integral from 0 to pi of f(x) cos(n x) dx.

Which is (2/pi) * [ integral from 0 to pi/2 of 0 * cos(nx) dx + integral from pi/2 to pi of 1 * cos(nx) dx ].

So that's (2/pi) * integral from pi/2 to pi of cos(nx) dx.

The integral of cos(nx) dx is (1/n) sin(nx).

Evaluated from pi/2 to pi:

(1/n) [ sin(n pi) - sin(n pi/2) ].

But sin(n pi) is zero for integer n. So it's (1/n) [ 0 - sin(n pi/2) ] = - sin(n pi/2)/n.

Thus, an = (2/pi) * [ - sin(n pi/2) / n ].

So,

an = - (2/(n pi)) sin(n pi/2).

As before.

Now, let's consider n as even and odd.

If n is even, say n=2m, then sin(n pi/2) = sin(m pi) = 0. So an=0 for even n.

If n is odd, say n=2m+1, then sin(n pi/2) = sin( (2m+1) pi/2 ) = (-1)^m.

So, for n=2m+1,

an = - (2/( (2m+1) pi )) * (-1)^m.

Thus,

an = (2 (-1)^{m+1} ) / ( (2m+1) pi ).

So, the Fourier series is:

f(x) = (a0)/2 + sum_{n=1}^\infty an cos(n x) = 1/2 + sum_{m=0}^\infty [ (2 (-1)^{m+1} ) / ( (2m+1) pi ) ) ] cos( (2m+1) x )

We can rewrite this as:

1/2 - (2/pi) sum_{m=0}^\infty [ (-1)^m cos( (2m+1)x ) / (2m+1) )

Which is the same as:

1/2 - (2/pi) sum_{n=0}^\infty [ (-1)^n cos( (2n+1)x ) / (2n+1) )

Now, looking back at the options, I need to find which one matches this expression.

Looking at the options:

Option A: ... sin(n) ... no.

Option B: sum starts at n=1, and uses cos(2n), which doesn't fit.

Option C: uses sin(2n+1) as numerator, no.

Option D: denominator is n, and cos(n), no.

Option E: uses tan, no.

Option F: cos(2n+1) as a number, not function of x.

Option G: cos(2n), no.

Option H: denominator 2n, and cos(2n+1) as number.

Option I
