Okay, so I've got this question about autocorrelation functions (ACF) and partial autocorrelation functions (PACF) for different models. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question has four statements, i to iv, and I need to figure out which are true. The options then give different combinations of these statements. Let's go through each statement one by one.

Statement i: The ACF and PACF will always be identical at lag one whatever the model. Wait, I remember that ACF at lag 1 is just the correlation between a term and the one before it. PACF at lag 1 is the partial correlation, which also considers the effect of intermediate terms. But wait, for lag 1, there are no intermediate terms, so PACF(1) should be equal to ACF(1). Because for the first lag, partialing out any other variables isn't applicable—there's nothing between them. So that makes sense, statement i should be true.

Statement ii: The PACF for an MA(q) model will in general be non-zero beyond lag q. MA stands for Moving Average. I remember that for MA(q), the ACF cuts off after q lags. But what about PACF? I think for MA models, the PACF tends to have a more extended tail. Like, for a pure MA model, the ACF is zero beyond q, but the PACF might not be. So PACF beyond lag q would be non-zero. So statement ii is true.

Statement iii: The PACF for an AR(p) model will be zero beyond lag p. AR is Autoregressive. For AR(p), the PACF should cut off at lag p. So beyond p, it's zero. I'm pretty sure that's correct. So statement iii is true.

Statement iv: The ACF and PACF will be the same at lag two for an MA(1) model. Hmm, MA(1) is a simple moving average model. Let's think. Let's say we have an MA(1): X_t = e_t + θ e_{t-1}. The ACF at lag 1 is θ/(1+θ²), and at lag 2, it's θ²/(1+θ²)², I think. What about PACF at lag 2? For MA(1), the PACF at lag 2 might involve some calculation. Wait, for an MA(1), the ACF at lag 2 is θ squared over (1+θ^2) squared. But what about the PACF?

I think for an MA(1), the PACF at lag 2 is... Maybe it's non-zero? Or perhaps not. Wait, for an MA(1), the ACF at lag 1 is non-zero, and at lag 2 is some value. But the PACF at lag 2—since PACF is about the correlation after removing the effect of lag 1. For MA(1), the process only has one term, so maybe the PACF at lag 2 would be zero. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, PACF(2) for MA(1): Let's model it. The PACF is the correlation between X_t and X_{t-2}, after adjusting for X_{t-1}. But in MA(1), X_t depends on e_t and e_{t-1}, X_{t-2} depends on e_{t-2} and e_{t-3}. So the PACF(2) should be zero because, after accounting for X_{t-1}, X_t and X_{t-2} are independent? Or wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, I remember that for MA(q), the ACF cuts off at q, but the PACF doesn't necessarily. But in this case, the question is about lag two for an MA(1), which has q=1. So the PACF at lag 2—would it be the same as ACF at lag 2? I'm not so sure. Let me think again: ACF(2) is non-zero for MA(1) because it's θ squared over something. PACF(2) for MA(1) might be zero because once you account for the first lag, the second lag doesn't add anything. Or perhaps not.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should consider an example. Let's say MA(1) with θ=0.5. Then ACF(1)=0.5/(1+0.25)=0.4. ACF(2)=0.5^2/(1+0.25)^2=0.16/0.5625≈0.2844. What about PACF(2)? Hmm, the PACF(2) for an MA(1) process is actually zero. Because the PACF is the correlation between x_t and x_{t-2}, controlling for x_{t-1}. But in an MA(1), x_t only depends on e_t and e_{t-1}, and x_{t-2} depends on e_{t-2} and e_{t-3}. So once you control for x_{t-1}, x_t and x_{t-2} are independent. That would mean PACF(2) is zero. So in that case, ACF(2) is about 0.284, and PACF(2)=0. So they're not the same. So statement iv is false.

Wait, but another approach: PACF for MA(q) models beyond q may not necessarily be zero. But in the case of MA(1), PACF at lag 2 is zero because the process is of order 1. So statement iv claims that ACF and PACF are the same at lag two for MA(1). If ACF at 2 is non-zero and PACF is zero, then they aren't the same. So statement iv is false.

So reviewing the statements:

i: True.

ii: True.

iii: True.

iv: False.

Now the options:

Looking at the options, which options have i, ii, iii as true, and iv as false.

Looking through the options:

Option A: (i), (ii), and (iii) only. So that would be all three being true.

Option G says all four are true, which we don't think.

So the correct statements are i, ii, iii.

Wait wait, wait a minute. Let me double-check statement ii. Statement ii says the PACF for MA(q) is non-zero beyond q. So for an MA(q), is the PACF beyond q non-zero?

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. I thought that for MA(q), the ACF is zero beyond q, but the PACF might not be. But actually, wait, for an MA(q), the PACF does not necessarily become zero beyond q. I think in MA(q) models, the PACF can have significant values beyond q, but it's more about how the model is structured. Because in an MA model, the process is such that the PACF can have a longer tail, whereas in AR models, the PACF cuts off.

Wait, perhaps I was correct before. So statement ii says the PACF for MA(q) will in general be non-zero beyond lag q. So is that true? Let me think: For a pure MA(q), the ACF is zero beyond q, but the PACF can have non-zero values beyond q. So statement ii is correct.

So statements i, ii, iii are true, iv is false. So the correct option is A.

But wait, what about statement iii: PACF for AR(p) is zero beyond p. Yes, that's correct. Because in AR(p), the PACF should cut off at p. So statement iii is correct.

So the correct statements are i, ii, iii. So looking at the options, option A is (i), (ii), (iii) only. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but looking back at the options, let me check:

Options:

A: (i), (ii), and (iii) only

So the correct answer is A.

To determine which statements about the autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) are true, let us analyze each statement:

### Statement (i): 
"The ACF and PACF will always be identical at lag one whatever the model."  
At lag 1, both ACF(1) and PACF(1) measure the correlation between a term and the preceding term. Since there are no intermediate terms to adjust for at lag 1, ACF(1) and PACF(1) are indeed identical. This statement is **true**.

---

### Statement (ii): 
"The PACF for an MA(q) model will in general be non-zero beyond lag q."  
For a moving average (MA) model of order \( q \), the ACF is zero beyond lag \( q \), but the PACF does not necessarily become zero beyond lag \( q \). This is because the PACF captures more complex dependencies in the data. Therefore, this statement is **true**.

---

### Statement (iii): 
"The PACF for an AR(p) model will be zero beyond lag p."  
For an autoregressive (AR) model of order \( p \), the PACF will indeed be zero beyond lag \( p \), as the partial autocorrelation function cuts off at the order of the model. This statement is **true**.

---

### Statement (iv): 
"The ACF and PACF will be the same at lag two for an MA(1) model."  
For an MA(1) model, the ACF at lag 2 is non-zero (it depends on the parameter \( \theta \)), but the PACF at lag 2 is zero. This is because, after accounting for the first lag, there is no additional correlation at lag 2. Thus, ACF(2) and PACF(2) are not the same for an MA(1) model. This statement is **false**.

---

### Conclusion:  
The correct statements are (i), (ii), and (iii). Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**A: (i), (ii), and (iii) only.**
