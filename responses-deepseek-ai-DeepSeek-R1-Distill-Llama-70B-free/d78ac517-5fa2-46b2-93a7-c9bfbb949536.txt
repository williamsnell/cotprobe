Okay, so I need to solve this cube problem. Let me read the question again carefully.

Six positive integers are written on the faces of a cube. Each vertex is labeled with the product of the three numbers on the adjacent faces. The sum of all the vertex numbers is 1001. I need to find the sum of the numbers on the faces. The options are A to J, with various numbers like 36, 31, etc.

Hmm, let's break this down. A cube has 6 faces and 8 vertices. Each face has a number, and each vertex is the product of three faces that meet at that vertex.

Wait, so each vertex product is the product of three adjacent faces. But each face is adjacent to multiple vertices. For example, the top face is adjacent to four vertices (the four corners of the top face). So each face's number contributes to multiple vertex products.

I think there's a pattern or formula here. Let me try to model this.

Let me label the faces of the cube. Let's say the cube has faces: front (F), back (B), left (L), right (R), top (T), bottom (Bot). So six faces, each with a number: F, B, L, R, T, Bot.

Now, each vertex is where three faces meet. For example, the top front right vertex would be T * F * R. Similarly, the top front left is T * F * L, and so on.

Wait, but when you look at all eight vertices, each vertex corresponds to a unique combination of the faces. Let me list all the vertices and their product terms.

1. T, F, R → T*F*R
2. T, F, L → T*F*L
3. T, B, R → T*B*R
4. T, B, L → T*B*L
5. Bot, F, R → Bot*F*R
6. Bot, F, L → Bot*F*L
7. Bot, B, R → Bot*B*R
8. Bot, B, L → Bot*B*L

Now, the sum of all these products is 1001. So:

TFR + TFL + TBR + TBL + BotFR + BotFL + BotBR + BotBL = 1001.

Let me factor this expression. Hmm, maybe factor by grouping.

Looking at terms 1 and 2: TFR + TFL = TF(R + L)
Similarly, terms 3 and 4: TBR + TBL = TB(R + L)
Terms 5 and 6: BotFR + BotFL = BotF(R + L)
Terms 7 and 8: BotBR + BotBL = BotB(R + L)

So the sum becomes:

TF(R + L) + TB(R + L) + BotF(R + L) + BotB(R + L)

Factor out (R + L):

(TF + TB + BotF + BotB) * (R + L)

Hmm, let's see. TF + TB is T(F + B), and BotF + BotB is Bot(F + B). So:

T(F + B) + Bot(F + B) = (T + Bot)(F + B)

So the sum becomes:

(T + Bot)(F + B)(R + L)

Because:

Sum = (T + Bot)(F + B)(R + L)

And we know that this sum equals 1001.

So, (T + Bot)(F + B)(R + L) = 1001.

Wait, 1001 is a specific number. I should factorize 1001 to see possible combinations.

I remember that 1001 factors into primes. Let me see:

1001 ÷ 7 = 143 (because 7*143=1001)
143 ÷ 11 =13 (because 11*13=143)
So 1001 = 7 × 11 × 13.

So, the product of three factors equals 1001. That suggests that (T + Bot), (F + B), and (R + L) are 7, 11, and 13 in some order, because all are primes.

So, each of these sums (T + Bot), (F + B), (R + L) must be 7, 11, 13 in some permutation.

But wait, the problem says that the numbers on the faces are positive integers. So T, Bot, F, B, R, L are all positive integers, meaning that their sums would be at least 2 each (since 1+1=2).

So, each sum is one of 7, 11, 13.

Now, the question asks for the sum of the numbers on the faces. That is, F + B + L + R + T + Bot.

Which can be written as (F + B) + (L + R) + (T + Bot).

Which is exactly the sum of the three factors we have: (7 + 11 + 13).

Wait, wait a second. Because (F + B) is one factor, (L + R) is another, and (T + Bot) is the third. So their sum is 7 + 11 +13 = 31.

So the sum of the numbers on the faces is 31. Looking at the options, option B is 31.

So the answer should be B.

To solve the problem, we start by noting that a cube has 6 faces and 8 vertices. Each face has a positive integer written on it, and each vertex is labeled with the product of the three numbers on the adjacent faces. The sum of the numbers on all 8 vertices is given as 1001. We need to find the sum of the numbers written on the 6 faces.

### Key Observations:
1. **Structure of the Cube**: Label the faces of the cube as follows:
   - Front (F), Back (B), Left (L), Right (R), Top (T), Bottom (Bot).
   - Each vertex is the product of three adjacent faces. For example, the top front right vertex is \( T \cdot F \cdot R \).

2. **Sum of Vertex Products**: The sum of the numbers on the 8 vertices can be expressed as:
   \[
   T(F + B)(R + L) + \text{Bot}(F + B)(R + L)
   \]
   Factoring further, this simplifies to:
   \[
   (T + \text{Bot})(F + B)(R + L)
   \]
   This product equals 1001.

3. **Factorization of 1001**: The number 1001 factors into primes as:
   \[
   1001 = 7 \times 11 \times 13
   \]
   Therefore, the sums \((T + \text{Bot})\), \((F + B)\), and \((R + L)\) must correspond to 7, 11, and 13 in some order.

4. **Sum of Face Numbers**: The sum of the numbers on the 6 faces is:
   \[
   F + B + L + R + T + \text{Bot}
   \]
   This can be rewritten as:
   \[
   (F + B) + (L + R) + (T + \text{Bot})
   \]
   Substituting the values from the factorization, we get:
   \[
   7 + 11 + 13 = 31
   \]

### Conclusion:
The sum of the numbers written on the faces of the cube is **31**.
