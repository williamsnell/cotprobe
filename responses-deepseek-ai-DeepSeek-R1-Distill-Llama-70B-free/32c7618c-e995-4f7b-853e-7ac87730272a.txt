Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

Fred Lowes is a typewriter salesman. He gets $15 for each typewriter he sells. The question is, if he sells 12 typewriters, what's his commission? The options are A through J, each with a different dollar amount.

Alright, so the first thing I need to do is understand what's being asked. Commission in this context probably means the total amount Fred earns from selling those typewriters. So, it's like calculating his total earnings based on the number he sold and the rate per typewriter.

So, Fred earns $15 per typewriter. He sold 12 of them. To find the total commission, I think I need to multiply the amount he gets per typewriter by the number he sold. That makes sense because each sale gives him $15, so 12 sales would be 12 times that.

Let me write that out. Commission = number of typewriters sold × rate per typewriter. So, Commission = 12 × $15.

Now, calculating that. 12 times 15. Hmm, I should make sure I do this right. Let's break it down. 10 times 15 is 150, and 2 times 15 is 30. So adding those together, 150 + 30 = 180. So, 12 × 15 equals 180.

Wait, but let me double-check that multiplication to be sure. Alternatively, I could think of 15 as 10 + 5. So 12 × 10 is 120, and 12 × 5 is 60. Adding those together also gives 180. Yep, that checks out.

So Fred's commission would be $180. Now, looking back at the options provided, I need to find which one corresponds to $180.

The options are:
A: $210
B: $200
C: $225
D: $175
E: $195
F: $150
G: $255
H: $240
I: $180
J: $165

Looking through these, option I is $180. So the correct answer should be I.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through it again. 15 times 12. Another way to compute it is to multiply 15 by 10, which is 150, and 15 by 2, which is 30. 150 plus 30 is indeed 180. So yes, that's correct.

So the answer is I: $180.

To determine Fred Lowes' commission after selling 12 typewriters at a rate of $15 per typewriter, multiply the number of typewriters sold by the commission per typewriter:

\[
\text{Commission} = 12 \times 15 = 180
\]

Thus, Fred's commission is $180, which corresponds to option I.

Answer: I
