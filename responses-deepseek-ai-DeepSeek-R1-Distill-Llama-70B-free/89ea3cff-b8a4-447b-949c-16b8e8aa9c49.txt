Alright, let's try to figure this problem out. Okay, so Jane Carpov held a 60-day note for $4200 with 5% interest. She discounted it 25 days before maturity at 6%. I need to find the proceeds she got from discounting it.

Hmm, I remember that when you discount a note, you're basically getting the present value of the note before it matures. The formula for the present value (PV) of a note is usually PV = FV / (1 + r*t), where FV is the face value, r is the discount rate, and t is the time in years.

Wait, but wait, notes can have different interest calculations. Let me think—this is probably using simple interest since the time here is in days and it's a short period (60 days). So the formula for the discount would be based on simple interest.

Right, the discounting formula for simple interest is: Proceeds = Face Value - (Face Value * discount rate * time). Or alternatively, since the discount is the interest on the face value for the unexpired time, the proceeds would be FV minus the discount.

Alternatively, I've heard of the formula using the present value factor, which is 1/(1 + rt), but I think that applies more to when you're calculating the present value of a single sum. Since this is a note, which is a single sum, that method should work.

Wait, but the note is bearing interest at 5%. Oh, wait, but when you discount a note, the interest on the note itself is separate from the discount. So maybe the interest on the note isn't directly needed here because the proceeds are about the present value of the note, considering the discount rate. Or perhaps the 5% is the interest rate on the note, but the discounting is done at a different rate (6%).

So let's clarify. The note is for $4200, 60 days, 5% interest. But Jane discounted it 25 days before maturity, so there's 25 days left. The discount rate is 6%. 

Wait, but when you discount a note, you're getting the present value, which means you're calculating how much the note is worth today. So the formula would be:

Proceeds = Face Value / (1 + (discount rate * time in years))

But wait, time here is 25 days. Since the rate is given as 6%, I need to convert 25 days into years. 

There are 360 days in a year usually for such calculations. So 25 days is 25/360 years. 

So the discount rate per year is 6%, so the rate for the time is 6% * (25/360) = (0.06 *25)/360.

Let me calculate that: 0.06 *25 is 1.5. 1.5 divided by 360 is 0.004166667.

So the denominator is 1 + 0.004166667 = 1.004166667.

So proceeds = 4200 / 1.004166667.

Let me compute that. Alternatively, I can compute it as 4200 * (1/(1 + (0.06*(25/360)))).

Wait, another approach: the discount amount is FV * rate * time. So discount = 4200 * 0.06 * (25/360).

Compute that: 4200 * 0.06 is 252. 252 * (25/360) = (252*25)/360.

252 *25 is 6300. 6300 /360 is 17.5. So the discount is $17.5.

So proceeds = face value - discount = 4200 -17.5 = 4182.5.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 4182.50. The options are A to J, with E being 4160.75, etc.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the interest rate on the note affects the calculation. Oh wait, the note itself has 5% interest. So perhaps I should calculate the interest accrued on the note and then discount that amount.

Wait, the note is for 60 days at 5% interest. So the total interest on the note when it matures would be 4200 * 0.05 * (60/360). Because 60 days is 1/6 of a year.

Wait, 0.05 * (60/360) is 0.05 * (1/6) = 0.0083333. So 4200 * 0.00833333 is about 35. So the note would pay $4200 + $35 = $4235 at maturity.

But Jane is discounting it 25 days before maturity. So she's getting the present value of $4235, but at a 6% discount rate for 25 days.

Wait, that makes more sense. So the face value (FV) is the maturity value of the note. So FV = 4200 + interest, which is 4200 * (1 + 0.05*(60/360)).

Yes, that's correct. So FV is 4235.

Now, the discount is for the remaining 25 days at 6%.

So the present value (proceeds) would be FV / (1 + r*t), where r is 6%, t is 25/360.

So FV is 4235.

r * t = 0.06 * (25/360) = 0.004166667.

So denominator is 1.004166667.

Proceeds = 4235 / 1.004166667.

Let me compute that. 4235 divided by 1.004166667.

Alternatively, compute 4235 * (1 / (1 + 0.06*(25/360))).

Let me compute 1.004166667 as approximately 1.00416667.

So 4235 / 1.00416667.

Let me try to calculate this division.

First, approximate:

1.00416667 ≈ 1.0041667.

Let me compute 4235 divided by 1.0041667.

Well, 4235 * (1/1.0041667) ≈ 4235 * 0.9958333.

Wait, because 1/1.0041667 ≈ 0.9958333.

Wait, 1.0041667 is approximately 1 + 0.0041667. So 1/(1 + 0.0041667) ≈ 1 - 0.0041667 + (0.0041667)^2 - ... Using the approximation for small x, 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 -x.

So 4235 * (1 - 0.0041667) = 4235 - (4235 * 0.0041667).

Calculate 4235 * 0.0041667.

4235 * 0.004 is 16.94. 4235 * 0.0001667 is approximately 4235 * 0.0001667 ≈ 0.706. So total is about 16.94 + 0.706 = 17.646.

So 4235 - 17.646 ≈ 4217.354.

Looking at the options, option G is $4217.35.

So the correct answer would be G.

To determine the proceeds from discounting the note, we first calculate the maturity value of the note, which includes the face value and the interest accrued over the 60-day period. The interest is calculated using simple interest:

\[
\text{Interest} = 4200 \times 0.05 \times \frac{60}{360} = 4200 \times 0.05 \times 0.1667 = 35
\]

Thus, the maturity value of the note is:

\[
\text{Maturity Value} = 4200 + 35 = 4235
\]

Next, we discount this maturity value back to its present value using the discount rate of 6% for the remaining 25 days. The time in years is:

\[
\text{Time (in years)} = \frac{25}{360}
\]

The discount factor is calculated as:

\[
\text{Discount Factor} = 1 + (0.06 \times \frac{25}{360}) = 1 + 0.0041667 = 1.0041667
\]

The present value (proceeds) is then:

\[
\text{Proceeds} = \frac{4235}{1.0041667}
\]

Using approximations for simplicity, we find:

\[
\text{Proceeds} \approx 4235 \times (1 - 0.0041667) = 4235 - (4235 \times 0.0041667)
\]

Calculating the discount:

\[
4235 \times 0.0041667 \approx 17.646
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{Proceeds} \approx 4235 - 17.646 = 4217.354
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, the proceeds are approximately $4217.35. Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:

**G: $4217.35**
