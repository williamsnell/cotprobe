Options:

A: The subroutine procedure checks if each length value is between 0 and 100
B: The subroutine procedure returns the length value to the main program
C: The subroutine procedure is called only once in the program
D: The subroutine procedure is called at the beginning and end of the main program to validate the length
E: The subroutine procedure is called multiple times, each time incrementing the length value by 1
F: The subroutine procedure is called from three different points in the program, checks if each length value is between 0 and 90, and returns control to the main program.
G: The subroutine procedure is used to exit the main program if the length is within the specified range
H: The subroutine procedure is called recursively within itself to handle multiple length values
I: The subroutine procedure generates a list of length values from 0 to 90
J: The subroutine procedure is a loop that continues until the length value is outside the range of 0 to 90

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this programming question. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a procedure called VERIFY_TEST_VALUES, which includes a subroutine procedure within itself. The subroutine is GET_AND_TEST_INPUT. I need to understand what this code does and then select the correct option from A to J.

Looking at the code structure, I see that VERIFY_TEST_VALUES calls GET_AND_TEST_INPUT multiple times. There are these bullet points with CALL GET_AND_TEST_INPUT, so maybe it's called three times? Wait, let me count. The main procedure starts, then there's a CALL, then some bullets, another CALL, and then after label L, another CALL. So maybe it's called three times in total.

Now, looking into the GET_AND_TEST_INPUT subroutine. It has a label AGAIN, and then a GETLIST(LENGTH). So GETLIST probably gets a value into LENGTH. Then there's an IF statement: if LENGTH is 0, it goes to L. Next, if LENGTH is less than 0 or greater than 90, it does something: puts an error message and goes back to AGAIN. So this is a loop that keeps asking for input until LENGTH is between 0 and 90, inclusive. Because if LENGTH is outside that range, it shows an error and loops again.

So the subroutine is called from the main procedure multiple times. Each time it's called, it gets a LENGTH value and checks if it's within 0 to 90. If not, it loops until it gets a valid value. Once valid, it returns control back to the main program.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the subroutine checks if each length is between 0 and 100. But the code checks for LENGTH >90, so it's up to 90, not 100. So A is incorrect.

Option B says the subroutine returns the length to the main program. Well, yes, but that's not the primary action; the main point is validation and looping. So maybe B is part of it, but not the whole picture.

Option C claims it's called once. No, I think it's called three times as per the main procedure.

Option D says it's called at beginning and end. I don't see that; it's called three times in the middle, maybe.

Option E says each call increments length by 1. The code doesn't show that; it just gets a new value each time.

Option F: Subroutine is called three times, checks if each length is between 0 and 90, returns control. That sounds right. Because each call would handle one input, checking the range, and then returns. So F looks correct.

Option G says it's used to exit if length is within range. No, because it loops until it's within range, then returns, not exits the main program.

Option H suggests recursion. But the subroutine calls itself? No, the main procedure calls it multiple times, not the subroutine calling itself.

Option I says it generates a list from 0 to90. No, it just validates input.

Option J: It's a loop until length is outside 0-90. Wait, no, the loop continues until LENGTH is within 0-90. Because if it's outside, it loops again. So J says it continues until outside, which is the opposite. So J is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be F.

The subroutine procedure `GET_AND_TEST_INPUT` is called three times from the main procedure `VERIFY_TEST_VALUES`. Each time it is called, it prompts for a `LENGTH` value using `GETLIST(LENGTH)`. The subroutine then checks if the input is within the range of 0 to 90. If the input is outside this range, it displays an error message and loops back to collect the input again. Once a valid value is entered, the subroutine returns control to the main program. This behavior matches the description in option F.

**Answer: F**
