Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about magnesium metal being oxidized by a solution of chromium (III) nitrate. I'm a bit rusty on my redox reactions, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that when metals react, they usually lose electrons (oxidation), and something else gains electrons (reduction). So magnesium is probably going to oxidize, and the chromium is going to reduce.

The question is about writing the net ionic equation. Net ionic equations show only the species that change, leaving out the spectators. So I need to figure out what's happening in the reaction.

Magnesium metal is in its elemental form, so Mg(s). The chromium is in solution as Cr(NO3)3. I think the nitrate ion might be a spectator here, but I'm not sure yet.

Let me break it down. The oxidation half-reaction would be Mg losing electrons. So Mg(s) → Mg²+ + 2e⁻. Each magnesium atom loses two electrons.

The reduction half-reaction would involve the chromium ions. Chromium is in +3 oxidation state in Cr³+. It's going to gain electrons to form Cr metal. So Cr³+ + 3e⁻ → Cr(s). Each Cr³+ gains three electrons.

Now, to balance the electrons, I need to make sure the number of electrons lost equals the number gained. So for each Mg, 2 electrons are lost. For each Cr³+, 3 electrons are gained. So I need a common multiple, which is 6 electrons.

So I'll multiply the Mg reaction by 3 and the Cr reaction by 2. That way, 3 Mg atoms lose 6 electrons total, and 2 Cr³+ gain 6 electrons total.

Putting them together:

3 Mg(s) → 3 Mg²+ + 6 e⁻
2 Cr³+ + 6 e⁻ → 2 Cr(s)

Adding these gives:

3 Mg + 2 Cr³+ → 3 Mg²+ + 2 Cr

So the net ionic equation is 3 Mg(s) + 2 Cr³+ → 3 Mg²+ + 2 Cr(s).

Looking at the options, I need to find which one matches this.

Option E: 3 Mg(s) + 2 Cr³+ → 3 Mg²+ + 2 Cr(s). That looks exactly like what I derived.

Wait, what about the other options? Let me make sure. Option E is the one that matches the balanced equation without any extra ions. Some of the other options include nitrate ions, which I think are spectators and shouldn't be in the net ionic equation. For example, option C has Cr3+ but the wrong stoichiometry maybe. Option H has a 1:1 ratio, which isn't balanced for electrons. So yeah, E seems correct.

To determine the correct net ionic equation for the reaction where magnesium metal is oxidized by a solution of chromium (III) nitrate, we analyze the redox processes involved. Magnesium undergoes oxidation, losing electrons as it forms Mg²⁺, while chromium (Cr³⁺) undergoes reduction, gaining electrons to form elemental chromium (Cr). 

The oxidation half-reaction is:
\[
\text{Mg(s)} \rightarrow \text{Mg²⁺} + 2e⁻
\]
The reduction half-reaction is:
\[
\text{Cr³⁺} + 3e⁻ \rightarrow \text{Cr(s)}
\]

To balance the electrons, the oxidation reaction is multiplied by 3, and the reduction reaction is multiplied by 2, resulting in:
\[
3 \text{Mg(s)} \rightarrow 3 \text{Mg²⁺} + 6e⁻
\]
\[
2 \text{Cr³⁺} + 6e⁻ \rightarrow 2 \text{Cr(s)}
\]

Adding these together gives the balanced net ionic equation:
\[
3 \text{Mg(s)} + 2 \text{Cr³⁺} \rightarrow 3 \text{Mg²⁺} + 2 \text{Cr(s)}
\]

Among the options provided, only **Option E** matches this equation. Other options either include spectator ions (e.g., nitrate ions) or have incorrect stoichiometry. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**E: 3Mg(s) + 2Cr³⁺ → 3Mg²⁺ + 2Cr(s)**

Answer: E
