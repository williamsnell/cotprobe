Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Cerenkov radiation. Hmm, I remember that Cerenkov radiation is when a charged particle moves through a medium faster than the speed of light in that medium, creating a shockwave kind of effect, like a sonic boom but for light. The problem is comparing it to a speed boat causing a bow wave in shallow water.

The question gives me the boat's speed as 60 km/hr, and the bow wave has an apex angle of 30 degrees. I need to find the depth of the water, h. The options are from A to J, with various meters.

Wait, right. I think the key here is relating the boat's speed to the phase velocity of the water waves. Oh right, the phase velocity v_ph is given by the square root of (g*h), where g is the acceleration due to gravity. So v_ph = sqrt(gh).

But wait, the boat's speed is 60 km/hr. I should probably convert that into meters per second because the standard unit for gravity is in m/s². Let me do that conversion. 

60 km/hr is equal to 60,000 meters per hour. Since there are 3600 seconds in an hour, dividing 60,000 by 3600 gives me 16.666... m/s. So approximately 16.67 m/s.

Now, the bow wave. The apex angle is 30 degrees. I think this relates to the angle of the bow wave, which is formed because the boat is moving faster than the wave speed in the water. So the bow wave forms a cone-like shape with an angle at the apex. 

I remember that the angle of the bow wave is related to the ratio of the boat's speed to the phase velocity of the water waves. Specifically, the sine of half the apex angle is equal to the phase velocity divided by the boat's speed. 

Wait, let me think. The formula I remember is sin(theta/2) = v_ph / v_boat. Because the phase velocity is the speed at which the waves are moving, and when the boat exceeds that, the waves form a cone with angle theta. So theta is the apex angle, which is 30 degrees here. So theta/2 is 15 degrees.

So sin(15°) = v_ph / v_boat.

I can compute sin(15°) using the exact value. I think sin(15) is (sqrt(6) - sqrt(2))/4. Let me calculate that. 

sqrt(6) is approximately 2.449, sqrt(2) about 1.414. So 2.449 - 1.414 is about 1.035. Divided by 4, that's approximately 0.2588. So sin(15°) ≈ 0.2588.

So 0.2588 = v_ph / v_boat.

But v_boat is 16.67 m/s, which I calculated earlier. So v_ph = 0.2588 * 16.67 ≈ 4.32 m/s.

But wait, v_ph is sqrt(gh). So sqrt(gh) = 4.32 m/s.

Solving for h, I can square both sides: gh = (4.32)^2. So h = (4.32)^2 / g.

g is approximately 9.81 m/s². So 4.32 squared is... let's see, 4 squared is 16, 0.32 squared is about 0.1024, and cross terms 2*4*0.32=2.56. So (4 + 0.32)^2 = 16 + 2.56 + 0.1024 = 18.6624.

So h = 18.6624 / 9.81 ≈ let's calculate that. 9.81 goes into 18.66 about 1.9 times, because 9.81 * 1.9 = 18.639. That's very close. So h ≈ 1.9 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are I: 2m, D:4m, etc. The closest is I:2m.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because 1.9 is close to 2. Maybe the approximation is why it's 2. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, let me re-express the formula:

v_boat = 60 km/h = 60,000 m / 3600 s = 16.6667 m/s.

apex angle θ = 30°, so θ/2 =15°, sin(15)=0.2588.

v_ph = v_boat * sin(θ/2) = 16.6667 * 0.2588 ≈ 4.32 m/s.

v_ph = sqrt(gh) → h = (v_ph)^2 / g = (4.32)^2 / 9.81 ≈ 18.6624 /9.81 ≈ 1.902 m.

So approximately 1.9 m, which is about 2 m. So the closest option is I:2m.

But wait, the options don't have I:2m as an option? Wait, looking back, the options are:

A:3m, B:5m, C:8m, D:4m, E:9m, F:6m, G:10m, H:7m, I:2m, J:12m.

Yes, option I is 2m. So the answer should be I.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because another approach could be considering the relation using the Mach number. Because in Cerenkov radiation, the condition is v > c/n, where n is the refractive index. But in the water case, perhaps the phase velocity is analogous to the speed of light in the medium.

Wait, the phase velocity v_ph = c/n_medium, but in this case, the water waves have phase velocity sqrt(gh). And the boat's speed is v_boat = 60 km/h. So, in terms of Mach number, it's v_boat / v_ph.

Wait, but in the case of the bow wave, the condition for a bow wave (like a shockwave) is when the boat's speed exceeds the phase velocity of the water waves. So the angle would be determined by that ratio.

So yes, the approach I took earlier should be correct. So h is approximately 1.9 meters, so the correct answer is I:2m.

To solve the problem, we compare the boat's motion to the phase velocity of water waves, given by \( v_{\text{ph}} = \sqrt{gh} \), where \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity and \( h \) is the water depth. The boat's speed is \( 60 \, \text{km/hr} \), which is converted to meters per second:

\[
v_{\text{boat}} = \frac{60 \times 10^3}{3600} \approx 16.67 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

The bow wave's apex angle is \( 30^\circ \), and the relationship between the boat's speed, the phase velocity, and the apex angle is given by:

\[
\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \frac{v_{\text{ph}}}{v_{\text{boat}}}.
\]

Here, \( \theta = 30^\circ \), so \( \theta/2 = 15^\circ \). Using \( \sin(15^\circ) \approx 0.2588 \), we solve for \( v_{\text{ph}} \):

\[
v_{\text{ph}} = v_{\text{boat}} \cdot \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = 16.67 \cdot 0.2588 \approx 4.32 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

Since \( v_{\text{ph}} = \sqrt{gh} \), we solve for \( h \):

\[
h = \frac{v_{\text{ph}}^2}{g} = \frac{(4.32)^2}{9.81} \approx \frac{18.66}{9.81} \approx 1.90 \, \text{m}.
\]

The closest option to \( h \approx 1.90 \, \text{m} \) is \( 2 \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to option I.
