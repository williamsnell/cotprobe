C: women's susceptibility to stress depended on their levels of social support
D: men and women have drastically different levels of diagnosed depression
E: men's susceptibility to stress depended on their levels of social support
F: depression is more common in women due to hormonal differences

Okay, I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about the Brown & Harris (1978) study on depression. I remember that Brown and Harris did some important work on the social factors related to depression, especially focusing on women. Let me think about what I learned from that study.

So, the question is asking what they found. The options are A through J, each making a different claim about their findings. I think Brown and Harris looked into the role of life events and social support in the context of depression. From what I recall, they found that women were more likely to experience depression than men. But why was that?

Wait, wasn't it because of the social factors rather than biological ones? I think they suggested that women's higher rates of depression were due to their social roles and lack of social support, not necessarily hormonal differences. So any option that talks about hormonal differences (like option F) is probably incorrect.

Looking at the options, option C says women's susceptibility to stress depended on their levels of social support. That sounds familiar. Brown and Harris might have found that women with lower social support were more susceptible, which would fit with option C. Also, I remember that they looked at how having a confiding relationship, like a partner, could protect against depression. So women without such support were more at risk.

Option I says self-reported depression is highest among women and the economically disadvantaged. I'm not sure about the specifics on economic status. I think their study focused more on social support rather than economic factors. So maybe I is not the right choice.

Option B says depression is less likely with high social support regardless of gender. That makes sense because social support helps buffer stress. But the question is specifically about Brown & Harris's findings. I think they focused more on women in their study, maybe? Or perhaps they found this applies across genders, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another point. Brown and Harris proposed that vulnerability factors, such as having three or more children under 14, lack of a confiding relationship, and unemployment, increased the risk of depression in women when they faced a severe life event. So it's about how certain factors, including social support, make women more susceptible.

So looking back, option C says women's susceptibility depends on social support. That fits because if a woman has good social support, she's less likely to get depressed when facing stress. Option B is about high social support reducing depression regardless of gender, but I'm not sure if that's exactly what they found or if they focused specifically on women.

Another thought: I remember that their study found that among women, the presence of a confiding relationship (a form of social support) was a protective factor. So without that support, women were more susceptible. So option C aligns with that.

Option I mentions self-reported depression being highest in women and the economically disadvantaged. I'm not sure about the economic part. Their study might not have focused on economic status as much as on social support and life events.

So between options B, C, and I. Let me think about what the question is asking. The question is about what Brown and Harris found. So if they found that women's susceptibility to stress (like life events) depended on their social support, that's option C. If they found that high social support in general reduces depression, that's option B, but I'm not sure if that's what they concluded.

Wait, I think Brown and Harris's model included both provoking agents (like life events) and vulnerability factors (like lack of social support). So the presence of these factors made women more susceptible. So option C is pointing out that women's susceptibility depends on their social support levels.

So the correct answer should be option C.

Brown & Harris (1978) conducted a study on depression and found that women's susceptibility to stress and depression was influenced by their levels of social support. Specifically, they identified that women without a confiding relationship or other forms of social support were more vulnerable to depression when facing severe life events. This aligns with option C, which states that women's susceptibility to stress depended on their levels of social support. 

Option B, while plausible, is broader and less specific to the findings of Brown & Harris, who focused particularly on women's experiences. Option I mentions economic disadvantage, which was not a primary focus of their study. Therefore, the most accurate answer is:

C: women's susceptibility to stress depended on their levels of social support.

Answer: C
