Okay, so I've got this problem about the decomposition of hydrogen iodide, HI, and I need to find the second-order rate constant using collision theory. Hmm, I remember that the Arrhenius equation relates the rate constant to temperature and activation energy, but wait, the question says to use collision theory instead. Right, collision theory involves the kinetic molecular theory and factors like collision frequency and orientation.

The given data: the temperature is 393.7°C. Oh wait, I need to convert that to Kelvin because all the gas laws and collision theory formulas use absolute temperature. So, 393.7 + 273.15 gives me 666.85 K. Let me double-check that calculation. Yes, 393 + 273 is 666, and the 0.7 makes it 666.85 K.

The activation energy (Ea) is given as 45.6 kcal/mol. Wait, I remember that in gas constant terms, Ea is often in J/mol. So I need to convert that. 1 kcal is 4184 J, so 45.6 kcal is 45.6 * 4184 = let's calculate that. 45 * 4184 is 188,280 and 0.6 *4184 is 2510.4, so total 190,790.4 J/mol. Oh wait, wait, 45.6 is 45 + 0.6, so 45*4184= (40*4184=167,360) + (5*4184=20,920) → 188,280. Then 0.6*4184=2510.4, so 188,280 + 2,510.4 = 190,790.4 J/mol. So Ea is 190,790.4 J/mol.

The molecular weight (Mw) of HI is 127.9 g/mol. I'll need that to find the molar mass in kg/mol for calculations. So 127.9 g/mol is 0.1279 kg/mol.

The collision diameter (σ) is 3.5 Å, which is 3.5e-10 meters. The orientation factor P is given as 1, so that's easy.

I think the formula for the rate constant from collision theory is k = (P * sqrt(2) * π * d^2 * sqrt( (3RT)/(M) )) * e^(-Ea/(RT)) ) / (Ne^3). Wait, no, wait. The collision theory formula for a bimolecular reaction (which I think second-order implies) is k = (P * π * d² * sqrt( (8k_B T)/(π μ) )) ) * e^(-Ea/(RT)), but I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, the formula is k = (collision frequency) * (steric factor) * (exponential term).

Wait, perhaps it's better to recall the specific formula. The second-order rate constant for a bimolecular reaction can be expressed using the collision theory as:

k = (P * sqrt(2) * π * d^2 * sqrt( (3RT)/(M)) )) / (N_A * h) ) * (1/(c^*) ) )

Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think again. The collision theory formula for the rate constant k is given by:

k = (P * Z ) * e^(-Ea/(RT))

Where Z is the collision frequency. But wait, Z is the number of collisions per unit time per unit volume. Oh wait, no, Z is the collision frequency per molecule. Hmm, perhaps I should look up the exact formula.

Wait, I recall that for a reaction A + A → products (which would be second-order), the rate is k[A]^2, and k is given by:

k = (sqrt(2) * π d² * sqrt( (8k_B T)/(π μ) )) * P * e^(-Ea/(RT)) ) / (N_A)

Wait, maybe I'm getting mixed up between the terms. Alternatively, the collision theory expression for a bimolecular elementary reaction is:

k = ( (π d^2) * sqrt(8 k_B T / (π μ)) ) * P * (1/N_A) ) * e^(-Ea/(RT))

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact formula. Let's try to break it down.

The collision frequency Z for a single molecule is given by Z = sqrt(2) * π d² n * sqrt( (3 k_B T) / (m) ), where n is the number density, m is the mass of a molecule. But for the rate constant, since it's per unit concentration, perhaps we need to express it in terms of concentrations.

Alternatively, the rate constant k is given by:

k = (P * (sqrt(2)) * π d²) / (N_A^2 h^3) ) * ( (8 m π k_B T)^(1/2) ) * e^(-Ea/(RT)) )

Wait, perhaps another approach. The formula I'm thinking of is:

k = ( (sqrt(2) * π * d^2 * sqrt( (8 k_B T) / (π μ) )) ) * P ) / (N_A^2) ) * e^(-Ea/(RT))

Wait, μ is the reduced mass, but since both reactants are the same (HI decomposing into H and I, perhaps), so μ = m/2, where m is the mass of HI.

Let me try to structure the formula properly.

The collision theory rate constant for a second-order reaction (A + A → products) is:

k = (sqrt(2) * π * d^2 * sqrt( (8 k_B T) / (π μ) )) ) * (1/N_A^2) ) * P * e^(-Ea/(RT))

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact expression. Let me try to find the correct formula.

Another approach: the rate constant from collision theory is given by:

k = (P * Z ) / (N_A) ) * e^(-Ea/(RT))

Where Z is the collision frequency per molecule per second. Wait, no, Z is the number of collisions per unit time per unit volume. So, for a second-order reaction, the rate is k[A]^2 = (collision rate) * [A]^2. The collision rate is Z * [A]^2 * V, but maybe I'm confusing terms.

Alternatively, the collision frequency Z (per unit volume) is given by Z = sqrt(2) * π d² * sqrt( (8 k_B T) / (π m) )) * [A]^2, where m is the mass of a molecule. Then, the rate constant is k = (P * Z ) / [A]^2 = (P * sqrt(2) * π d² * sqrt( (8 k_B T) / (π m) )) ) / (1), but that can't be right because it would leave [A]^2, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, no. The rate is rate = k [A]^2 = Z * P * [A]^2 / (N_A^2 V) ), but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for the second-order rate constant is:

k = (P * π d² * sqrt(8 k_B T / (π μ)) ) / (N_A^2 h^3 (2)^{1/2}) )) * e^(-Ea/(RT)) )

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach.

Wait, I recall the formula for the collision theory rate constant as:

k = (sqrt(2) * π * d^2 * sqrt( (3 R T) / (M) )) * P * (1 / (N_A^2)) )) * e^(-Ea/(R T))

Wait, M is the molar mass. So let's try to plug in the numbers.

Breaking it down:

Compute the terms step by step.

Given:

d = 3.5 Å = 3.5e-10 m

M = 0.1279 kg/mol (since Mw is 127.9 g/mol)

R = 8.314 J/mol·K

T = 666.85 K

P = 1

N_A = Avogadro's number = 6.022e23 mol^-1

Ea = 190790.4 J/mol

Let me compute the pre-exponential factor first, which is the part without the exponential.

So the pre-exponential factor A = (sqrt(2) * π * d² * sqrt( (3 R T) / M )) * P ) / (N_A^2 )

Wait, but wait, for a second-order reaction, the rate constant has units of M^-1 s^-1. Let me check the units to see if this formula makes sense.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed step by step.

Compute each part:

First, compute sqrt(2): approximately 1.4142.

Then, π is about 3.1416.

d squared is (3.5e-10 m)^2 = 12.25e-20 m².

sqrt( (3 R T)/M ) → compute (3 *8.314 * 666.85) / 0.1279.

Let me compute numerator: 3 *8.314 =24.942; 24.942 *666.85 ≈ 24.942 * 667 ≈ let's compute 24 * 667 = 16008, 0.942 *667≈628. So total ≈ 16636.

So (3 R T) ≈ 16636 J/mol.

Then divide by M: 16636 / 0.1279 ≈ let me compute 16636 / 0.1279.

0.1279 is approximately 0.128. 16636 / 0.128 → 16636 * (1/0.128) = 16636 * 7.8125 ≈ let's compute 16636 * 7 = 116,452; 16636 * 0.8125 = approx 13,517.5. So total about 129,969.5 J·mol^{-1}.

Wait, but wait, 3RT has units J/mol, M is kg/mol, so (3RT)/M has units (J/mol)/(kg/mol) )= J/kg.

Wait, but J is kg·m²/s², so J/kg is (m²/s²). So sqrt( (3RT)/M ) will have units sqrt(m²/s² )= m/s.

So sqrt( (3 R T)/M ) = sqrt(16636 / 0.1279 ) J^0.5 kg^-0.5 ? Hmm, maybe I should recheck units.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. The term inside the square root is (3RT)/M, which when R is in J/mol·K, T in K, M in kg/mol, gives (J/(mol·K) * K) / (kg/mol) )= (J/mol) * (mol/kg) )= J/kg. Since J = kg·m²/s², J/kg = m²/s². So sqrt(m²/s²) is m/s.

So sqrt( (3 R T)/M ) = m/s.

Putting it all together:

So, the term sqrt( (3 R T)/M ) = sqrt(16636 / 0.1279 ) ≈ sqrt(129,969.5) ≈ 360.5 m/s.

Wait, let me compute 16636 / 0.1279 accurately.

0.1279 is approximately 0.1279. Let me compute 16636 ÷ 0.1279.

Compute 16636 ÷ 0.1279:

0.1279 * 130,000 = 0.1279 *130,000 = 16,627. So 0.1279 * 130,000 = 16,627, which is just under 16,636. The difference is 16,636 -16,627=9. So 9 / 0.1279 ≈70. So 130,070 → approximately 130,070 → wait, no, 0.1279 * x =16636 → x =16636 /0.1279 ≈130,000 + (9/0.1279)= approx 130,070.

Wait, but earlier I think I made a mistake, because 3RT is 3 *8.314 *666.85.

Wait, 3 *8.314 =24.942; 24.942 *666.85: Let me compute it accurately.

Compute 24 *666.85= 16004.4; 0.942 *666.85≈628. So total 16004.4 +628 = 16,632.4 J/mol.

So 16,632.4 /0.1279 kg/mol.

So 16,632.4 /0.1279 ≈ Let me compute 0.1279 * 130,000 =16,627. So 16,632.4 -16,627=5.4. So 5.4 /0.1279 ≈42.2. So total is 130,000 +42.2 =130,042.2.

So sqrt(130,042.2) ≈ 360.6 m/s.

So that term is approximately 360.6 m/s.

Now, putting all into the pre-exponential factor:

A = sqrt(2) * π * d² * (360.6) * P / (N_A^2 )

Compute each part:

sqrt(2)=1.4142

π=3.1416

d²= (3.5e-10)^2 =12.25e-20 m²

So 1.4142 *3.1416 ≈4.4429

4.4429 *12.25e-20 = let's compute 4.4429 *12.25 = approx 54.43, so 54.43e-20.

Then multiply by 360.6 m/s: 54.43e-20 *360.6 ≈ (54.43 *360.6 )e-20 → 54.43 *360 ≈19,600 (exactly 54.43 *360.6 is 54.43 * 360=19,590.8 plus 54.43*0.6=32.658 → total 19,623.46). So 19,623.46e-20 m²·m/s.

Wait, but wait, the units for d² is m², and 360.6 is m/s. So 1.4142 * π * d² * (sqrt(3RT/M )) → units would be m²*(m/s) → m³/s. Wait, but I'm not sure about the units here.

Now, multiply by P, which is 1, so no change.

Then divide by N_A^2: (6.022e23)^2 = approx 3.627e47.

So A = (19,623.46e-20 m³/s) / (3.627e47) → 19,623.46e-20 /3.627e47 → 5.41e-67 (since 19,623.46 /3.627 is about 5.41).

Wait, but wait, let me compute 19623.46e-20 /3.627e47 = 19623.46 /3.627 = approx 5.41 → 5.41e-67 (because 1e-20 /1e47 =1e-67). So A ≈5.41e-67 m³/(s·mol²) ?

Wait, but the rate constant has units of M^-1 s^-1, which is (mol^-1 L) s^-1, or (mol^-1 m^3) s^-1. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula because I'm getting m³/(s·mol²), which doesn't match the units of k (which should be m^3/(mol·s)).

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, the correct formula might actually be:

k = (sqrt(2) * π * d² * sqrt( (8 k_B T) / (π μ) )) * P * (1/(N_A^2)) )) * e^(-Ea/(R T))

Where μ is the reduced mass of the reactants. Since it's HI decomposing, perhaps we're considering HI molecules colliding with each other. So μ = (m * m)/(2m) )= m/2.

Wait, m is the mass of one HI molecule. M is the molar mass, so m = M / N_A. So μ = (M/(2 N_A)).

Let me compute μ.

M =0.1279 kg/mol. So m = 0.1279 /6.022e23 kg.

μ= m/2 =0.1279/(2 *6.022e23) kg.

So, now, compute sqrt( (8 k_B T) / (π μ) )

k_B is Boltzmann's constant=1.380649e-23 J/K.

Compute numerator: 8 *1.380649e-23 *666.85.

8 *1.380649e-23 ≈1.1045e-22. Multiply by 666.85: 1.1045e-22 *666.85 ≈7.37e-20.

Denominator: π * μ = π * 0.1279/(2 *6.022e23)

Compute denominator: 0.1279/(2 *6.022e23) →0.1279/(1.2044e24) ≈1.062e-25 kg.

Multiply by π: 3.1416 *1.062e-25 ≈3.345e-25.

So, (8k_B T)/(π μ) =7.37e-20 /3.345e-25 ≈2.204e5.

Take square root: sqrt(2.204e5 )= approx 469.4 m/s.

So now, the pre-exponential part is:

sqrt(2) * π * d² * (469.4) * P / (N_A^2 )

Compute each part:

sqrt(2)=1.4142

π=3.1416

d²=3.5e-10^2=12.25e-20 m²

So 1.4142 *3.1416 =4.4429

4.4429 *12.25e-20 =54.43e-20

Multiply by 469.4 →54.43e-20 *469.4 ≈2.557e-17.

Multiply by P=1, so 2.557e-17.

Now divide by N_A^2: 6.022e
