Okay, so I've got this problem here about Robert Rogers and his earnings as a real estate salesman. I'm a bit rusty on some of these calculations, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, let's see. The question is asking about Robert's gross earnings, standard deductions, and net earnings. The options are given from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one. 

First, the problem states that Robert's commission is 3.5% of his sales. His sales last month were $256,225. So, his gross earnings would be that commission, right? Because commission is part of his earnings before any deductions. So I think I can calculate that by multiplying 3.5% by the sales amount.

Let me do that calculation. 3.5% of 256,225. Hmm, 3.5% is 0.035 in decimal. So 256,225 times 0.035. Let me compute that. Let's break it down: 256,225 * 0.035. 

Wait, 256,225 times 0.03 is 7,686.75. And 0.005 of 256,225 is 1,281.125. So adding those together, 7,686.75 + 1,281.125 equals 8,967.875. So, rounding to the nearest cent, that's $8,967.88. So that's his gross earnings. 

Looking at the options, let's see which ones have $8,967.88 as the first number. Scanning through the options, option A has that as the first value. Option C has $8,967.88 as the first, but wait, actually looking again: Option C's first value is $8,967.88 but the second is $2,586.84. Wait, I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's proceed.

Next, the standard deductions. The problem says he's married and claims three exemptions. I remember that the standard deduction depends on filing status and the number of dependents or exemptions. Wait, no, actually, the standard deduction is a fixed amount based on filing status, and exemptions are different. Wait, I might be confusing terms here. Let me think.

Wait, I think the standard deduction is just a fixed amount for each filing status. For example, for married filing jointly, it's a certain amount. But wait, the number of exemptions (like personal exemptions) would reduce the taxable income. So perhaps the standard deduction is separate from the exemptions.

Wait, but in tax calculations, the standard deduction is subtracted from the gross income, along with personal exemptions, to get the taxable income. Or is it that the standard deduction is an alternative to itemizing deductions, and personal exemptions are separate? I think that's right. So in this case, Robert's standard deduction would be based on his filing status. Since he's married, I believe the standard deduction for married filing jointly is higher than for single. 

Wait, but I might need to recall the exact amounts. I'm a bit unsure about the exact numbers for the standard deduction. I think for the 2022 tax year, the standard deduction for married filing jointly was $25,900. But wait, that seems high for this problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using older figures. Or maybe I'm mixing it up with the personal exemption. Wait, personal exemptions were eliminated in recent tax reforms, but maybe this problem is using older rules. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the problem says he claims three exemptions. So perhaps each exemption is a certain amount, like $4,300 each in older tax laws. So for three exemptions, that would be 3 times $4,300, which is $12,900. But wait, standard deductions and exemptions are different. The standard deduction is a fixed amount based on filing status, and exemptions are subtracted per person.

Wait, let's clarify: the standard deduction is a fixed amount you can subtract from your income. Exemptions are additional amounts you can subtract, based on the number of people in your household. So for each exemption, you subtract a certain amount, like $4,050 per person in some years.

But I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again. The problem says he's married and claims three exemptions. So that's himself, his spouse, and one dependent? Or is it three dependents? Wait, no, the number of exemptions would be the number of people he's claiming. So if he's married, that's two people, and then one more dependent, making three. So each exemption might be $4,050, so total exemptions would be 3 * $4,050 = $12,150.

But wait, the question is about standard deductions, not exemptions. Oh, wait, maybe I'm mixing up terms. The standard deduction is a fixed amount for your filing status. So for married filing jointly, in recent years, it's been around $25,000 or so. But perhaps in the problem's context, it's a lower amount, or maybe it's using older numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps the standard deduction in this problem is calculated as a certain amount per exemption. No, that's not right. Let me think. Wait, perhaps the standard deduction is a fixed number, and the exemptions are separate. So for example, if the standard deduction is $6,300 for married filing jointly, and then he can subtract $4,050 per exemption. But wait, in that case, the total deductions would be standard deduction plus exemptions. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.

Alternatively, maybe the standard deduction includes the exemptions. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Wait, maybe I should look at the options to see which ones make sense. The options list the standard deductions as varying amounts, like $2,586.84, $2,075.67, etc. So perhaps the standard deduction here isn't the large number I was thinking, maybe it's something else.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the standard deduction refers to the total of standard deductions and exemptions. Or perhaps it's state taxes, or something else. Wait, no, the question is about federal income taxes, I think.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the steps to calculate net earnings. Typically, you start with gross earnings, subtract deductions and exemptions to get taxable income, then calculate taxes, and subtract that from gross to get net earnings.

So, if Robert's gross earnings are $8,967.88, then we need to calculate his standard deduction and any exemptions. Wait, but perhaps the standard deduction is a lump sum, and the exemptions are per person. So standard deduction for married filing jointly might be, say, $6,300, and then each exemption is $4,050. So three exemptions would be 3 * $4,050 = $12,150. So total deductions would be $6,300 + $12,150 = $18,450. But I'm not sure if that's correct, because I think the standard deduction is in lieu of itemizing, and the exemptions are separate. But perhaps in this problem, it's considering the standard deduction as a different thing, maybe state or local taxes, but that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach. Wait, let's think about the options. Option A has standard deductions of $2,586.84, option C also has that. Option B same. Option E has $2,075.67. So perhaps the standard deduction here is calculated as a percentage or some other factor.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the standard deduction as a percentage of gross earnings. Let me check the numbers. For example, $8,967.88 as gross. If standard deduction is 28.8% of that, then 8,967.88 * 0.288 = let's see, 8967.88 * 0.288. Hmm, 8967.88 * 0.2 is 1,793.58. 8967.88 * 0.08 is 717.43. 8967.88 * 0.008 is 71.74. So adding those: 1,793.58 + 717.43 = 2,510.01 + 71.74 = 2,581.75. That's close to $2,586.84, perhaps due to rounding. So maybe the standard deduction is 28.8% of gross earnings. But why 28.8%? I'm not sure. Maybe it's the tax bracket or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the standard deduction is a certain amount per month, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, like a flat rate for deductions.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. The problem gives sales of $256,225, and commission is 3.5%, so gross earnings are $8,967.88 as I calculated earlier. So the first part is correct.

Now, for the standard deductions, perhaps it's a flat rate. Looking at the options, the standard deduction is either $2,586.84, $2,075.67, $3,000, etc. So let's see. If standard deduction is $2,586.84, then perhaps that's 28.8% of gross. Wait, 28.8% of 8,967.88 is 2,586.84, exactly. So that seems to fit. So perhaps the standard deduction is 28.8% of gross earnings. But that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, perhaps it's a specific tax bracket or something else, but without more information, I can't be sure.

Wait, but let's proceed. So if standard deduction is $2,586.84, then the taxable income would be gross minus standard deduction. So 8,967.88 - 2,586.84 = 6,381.04. Then, we need to calculate the taxes on that taxable income.

Wait, but then there's also the exemptions. Wait, I thought exemptions were separate and subtracted after standard deductions. Or is it that the standard deduction includes the exemptions? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

In the US tax system, the standard deduction is a fixed amount based on filing status. Exemptions are additional amounts you can subtract per person. So for example, if you're married filing jointly, your standard deduction is X, and then you subtract Y per exemption. But in 2018, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) approximately doubled the standard deductions and eliminated personal exemptions. But some states still have their own rules. But perhaps this problem is using older rules where both standard deduction and exemptions apply.

So, assuming that's the case, the total deductions would be standard deduction plus exemptions. So standard deduction for married filing jointly, let's say it's $6,300 (as an example from older tax years), and each exemption is $4,050. So three exemptions would be 3 * 4,050 = 12,150. So total deductions would be 6,300 + 12,150 = 18,450. But that seems way too high given the options provided, which only have standard deductions around $2,500.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering only the standard deduction, not including exemptions, or vice versa. Alternatively, maybe the problem is using state income tax, but that's just a guess.

Wait, perhaps the standard deduction in this problem refers to something else. Let me look at the options again. Option A has standard deduction of $2,586.84, which is exactly 28.8% of the gross. So maybe the problem is using a standard deduction rate of 28.8%. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo and the intended calculation is different.

Alternatively, maybe the standard deduction is calculated based on the number of exemptions. Like, for each exemption, a certain deduction is allowed. But I'm not sure. Let's think differently. If Robert has three exemptions, perhaps each exemption is worth a certain deduction. For example, if each exemption is $858.95, then three would be 2,576.85, which is close to $2,586.84. That's probably a coincidence, but maybe that's the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the standard deduction is calculated as a percentage of the gross earnings. Let's see, 8,967.88 minus 28.8% gives us the taxable income. Wait, 28.8% of 8,967.88 is 2,586.84. So subtracting that gives 6,381.04. Then, perhaps the tax is calculated on that amount.

Wait, but then what about the exemptions? Oh, wait, maybe the standard deduction already includes the exemptions. So perhaps the standard deduction is $2,586.84, which accounts for both the filing status and the number of exemptions. That would make sense if, for example, the standard deduction for married with three exemptions is $2,586.84.

Assuming that's the case, then the taxable income would be 8,967.88 - 2,586.84 = 6,381.04. Then, we calculate the income tax on $6,381.04.

Wait, but what tax rate applies here? Since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps it's using a flat rate. Alternatively, maybe it's using a percentage based on the tax brackets. But without knowing the exact tax brackets, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the tax is 24%, or another rate.

Wait, let's look at the options for net earnings. Option A: net is $7,381.04. If we subtract the tax from gross, which is 8,967.88 - tax = 7,381.04. So tax would be 8,967.88 - 7,381.04 = 1,586.84. So the tax is $1,586.84. What's the tax rate here? 1,586.84 / 6,381.04 = approximately 24.87%. So around 24.87%, which is roughly 24.8%, close to 25%. So perhaps the tax rate is 25%.

Alternatively, perhaps it's using a different approach. Let me see. If the taxable income is $6,381.04, and the tax is calculated at a certain rate. Let's see, what's 25% of 6,381.04? That would be 1,595.26. But in option A, the tax is $1,586.84, which is a bit less than 25%. Hmm, perhaps it's using a lower rate.

Alternatively, maybe the tax brackets apply. Let me recall the 2023 tax brackets. For single filers, the 12% bracket goes up to $11,000. For married filing jointly, the 12% bracket goes up to $22,000. So if taxable income is $6,381.04, that would fall into the 12% bracket. So the tax would be 12% of 6,381.04, which is 765.725, approximately $765.73. But then the net earnings would be 8,967.88 - 765.73 = 8,202.15, which doesn't match any of the options. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, maybe the problem is using a different approach, perhaps a flat tax rate of 18% or something else. Let me calculate 18% of 6,381.04. That would be 1,148.59. So net would be 8,967.88 - 1,148.59 = 7,819.29, which isn't an option either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's go back. The problem states that Robert is a real estate salesman and his commission is 3.5% of his sales. So his gross earnings are 3.5% of 256,225, which we've determined is $8,967.88. So that's correct.

Now, the standard deductions. Let's think differently. Maybe the standard deduction here refers to federal income tax withheld, and it's calculated using a certain percentage. For example, using the single filer's tax table, but he's married, which might lower the withholding.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying and using a flat 25% tax rate for federal income tax. So 25% of $8,967.88 is 2,241.97. But that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, looking back at the options, the standard deductions vary. Option A has $2,586.84 as standard deduction. Then, net earnings are $7,381.04. So the tax would be 8,967.88 - 7,381.04 = 1,586.84. So the tax rate is 1,586.84 / 8,967.88 ≈ 17.7%. That doesn't correspond to any standard tax bracket I know.

Alternatively, perhaps it's not income tax, but perhaps other deductions like Social Security and Medicare. Wait, Social Security is 6.2% for employer and employee each, but for self-employed, it's 12.4%. Medicare is 2.9% for self-employed. But wait, Robert is a real estate salesman; is he considered self-employed or an employee? The problem says he's a salesman, so perhaps he's an employee, so Social Security would be 6.2% and Medicare 1.45%, totaling 7.65%.

But the problem doesn't mention any of that, so perhaps it's only considering federal income tax. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a 18% flat tax rate on the gross earnings. 18% of 8,967.88 is 1,614.22. So net would be 8,967.88 - 1,614.22 = 7,353.66, which is close to option C's net of 6,381.04, but not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the deductions include other factors. Let's see, the options have standard deductions of $2,586.84, which is exactly 28.8% of the gross. So 28.8% of 8,967.88 is 2,586.84. So perhaps the standard deduction is 28.8%, and then the net earnings are calculated after subtracting that and perhaps other taxes.

Wait, but if standard deduction is 2,586.84, and that's subtracted from gross, then the taxable income is 8,967.88 - 2,586.84 = 6,381.04. Then, if we apply a tax rate on that, say 18%, that would be 1,148.59. So net earnings would be 8,967.88 - 2,586.84 (standard deduction) - 1,148.59 (tax) = 5,232.45. But that's not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the standard deduction is the only deduction, and the tax is calculated on the gross minus standard deduction. Let's see, if standard deduction is 2,586.84, then taxable income is 6,381.04. If the tax on that
