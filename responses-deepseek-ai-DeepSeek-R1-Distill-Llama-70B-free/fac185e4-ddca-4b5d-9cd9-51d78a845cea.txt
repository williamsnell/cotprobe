Okay, I've got to figure out the maturity dates for these four drafts. Let's take each part one by one.

Starting with part (a): The draft is dated November 12 and is payable 60 days after date. So I need to add 60 days to November 12. November has 30 days. So from November 12, adding 30 days would bring us to December 12. Then, adding another 30 days gets us to January 11. Wait, no, wait: 60 days total. So November has 30 days, so from Nov 12, adding 30 days is Dec 12. Then adding the next 30 days: Dec has 31 days. So from Dec 12 to Dec 31 is 19 days. So 30 days after Dec 12 would be January 10 (because 30-19=11, so Dec 31 +11 days into January). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 60 days after Nov 12: Nov 12 to Nov 30 is 18 days (including the 12th?), no, wait. Wait, when you count days after, the starting day is day 0. So Nov 12 is day 0, then day 1 is Nov 13. So 60 days later would be... Let me think. Maybe it's easier to count each month. So from Nov 12, adding 60 days:

November: 30 days total. So from Nov 12 to Nov 30 is 18 days (including the 12th as day 0, so 19 days left in Nov after the 12th). Wait, no, the draft is dated Nov 12, and it's payable 60 days after that. So day 1 is Nov 13. So 60 days later is... Let's see. From Nov 13 to Nov 30: 17 days (since Nov has 30 days). So 17 days in Nov, then 60-17=43 days left. December has 31 days, so 31 in Dec. 43-31=12 days left. So that's 12 days into January. So Nov 13 + 17 days is Nov 30. Then Dec 31 is 31 days, so total 17+31=48, 60-48=12. So 12 days into January is January 12. Oh wait, because after Dec 31 comes Jan 1 as the next day. So adding 12 days to Jan 1 would be Jan 12. So the maturity date is January 12.

Wait, but I thought maybe it's Jan 11. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recount. Starting from Nov 12 as day 0, the next day is day 1 (Nov 13). So 60 days later would be day 60. Let's calculate:

From Nov 13 (day 1) to Nov 30: 30 -13 +1 = 18 days (including Nov 13 and Nov 30). Wait, maybe that's complicating. Alternatively, using a date calculator approach. Let's see:

Adding 60 days to Nov 12. November has 30 days, so from Nov 12, adding 30 days brings us to Dec 12 (since Nov 12 + 30 days is Dec 11? Wait, no. Wait, Nov 12 plus 1 day is Nov 13. So Nov 12 plus 30 days would be Dec 11, because 30 days in Nov after the 12th is 18 days (since Nov has 30 days, and 30-12=18, but wait, including the 12th as day 0, perhaps not. Maybe I'm confusing the count. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that adding 1 month to Nov 12 would be Dec 12, but that's for months, not days. Wait, no, adding 60 days is a fixed period.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of adding months and days. So 60 days is about 2 months. But let's think month by month.

From Nov 12, adding 60 days:

- November: from Nov 12 to Nov 30: 18 days (including the 12th? Or 19? Wait, no, because if today is day 0, then the next day is day 1. So Nov 12 is day 0. So 18 days in Nov after the 12th would be Nov 30 (since 30-12=18). So adding 18 days gets us to Nov 30 (day 18). Then we have 60-18=42 days left.

December: 31 days.

42-31=11 days left. So into January. So 11 days after Dec 31 is January 11.

Wait, that would make the maturity date January 11. But earlier I thought it was Jan 12. Hmm. Now I'm getting conflicting results. Which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I should think that the 60 days after Nov 12 is day 60.

Let me think of it as:

Nov 12 is day 0.

Day 1: Nov 13

Day 18: Nov 30 (18 days after Nov 12, because 13-30 is 18 days including both)

Then, December has 31 days, so adding 31 days to day 18 brings us to day 49 (18+31=49), which is Dec 31.

Then, the remaining days are 60-49=11 days. So add 11 days to Dec 31.

Dec 31 +1 day = Jan 1 (day 50)

Jan 1 + 11 days = Jan 12 (since day 50 + 11 = day 61? Wait, no, wait: day 49 is Dec 31. Then day 50 is Jan 1, day 51: Jan 2, and so on up to day 60: which is Jan 11 (because 50+11=61, but wait no, day 50 is Jan 1, so 11 days after is Jan 11. Because 50+11=61, but wait, the total days are 60, so starting from day 0 (Nov 12), day 60 would be the 60th day. So let me recount:

From Nov 12 (day 0), the next day is day 1 (Nov13).

So day 60 is the 60th day after Nov12.

Using this method, let's count:

Nov: 30 days. So from Nov12 (day 0) to Nov30 is 18 days (since Nov12 is day 0, Nov13 is day1, so Nov30 is day 18).

Then, December has 31 days. So from day19 (Dec1) to day49 (Dec31).

Then, January: day50 is Jan1.

So, day60 is Jan11 (since 50+11=61, but wait, that's day61. Wait, no: day50 is Jan1, so day51 is Jan2, ..., day60 is Jan11.

Wait, then the 60th day is Jan11. So the maturity date is Jan11.

But earlier, I thought it was Jan12. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. So for part (a), the correct date is January 11.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think differently. Let me check with a date calculator. Suppose today is Nov12, and I add 60 days. Let me count:

Nov12 + 60 days.

November has 30 days, so Nov12 + 30 days is Dec11 (because Nov12 to Nov30 is 19 days (including Nov12?), wait no, Nov12 is day 0, Nov13 is day1, Nov30 is day18. So 30 days from Nov12 is Dec11 (because Nov12 +30 days is Dec11). Then, adding another 30 days would be Jan10 (Dec11 +30 days). Wait, that's 60 days. So 30 days from Nov12 is Dec11, another 30 days is Jan10. So 60 days from Nov12 is Jan10. But that can't be right because 30+30=60, but depending on the months, it's different.

Wait, no. 60 days after Nov12 is...

Alternatively, perhaps using the approach:

Start with Nov12.

Add 60 days:

November: 30 days. So from Nov12, subtract the days left in November. Nov12 to Nov30 is 19 days (including Nov12). Wait, no: Nov has 30 days. So from Nov12, there are 30 -12 = 18 days left (not including Nov12). So wait: from Nov12, the next day is the 13th. So Nov12 is day0, Nov13 is day1.

So 60 days later:

November: 30 days, so Nov12 +18 days is Nov30 (day18).

Then, December: 31 days (day19 to day49).

So 49 days total, 60-49=11 days into January.

So Jan1 is day50, Jan11 is day60.

So the maturity date is Jan11.

So for part (a), the date is January 11.

Wait, but earlier, I thought it might be Jan12. Hmm. Well, I think Jan11 is correct because Nov12 to Jan11 is 60 days.

Wait, no, wait: 60 days after Nov12 would be Jan11. Because if I count 60 days starting from Nov12 as day0, then day60 is Jan11.

But some sources might count the due date as inclusive, but I think in this context, it's 60 days after, so it's Jan11.

So for part (a), the answer is January 11.

Moving on to part (b): Draft dated June 10, payable 3 months after date. So adding 3 months to June10.

June has 30 days. So June10 +3 months would be September10. Because June to July is 1 month, July to August another, August to September the third. So the maturity date is September10.

Wait, but sometimes, when adding months, if the day doesn't exist in the next month, it's adjusted. But June10 +3 months is September10, which is a valid date. So part (b) is September10.

Now part (c): Draft dated March3, payable 30 days after sight. It's accepted on March15. So the maturity date is 30 days after March15.

March15 is the acceptance date, so we add 30 days to that.

March has 31 days, so from March15, adding 30 days:

March15 to March31 is 16 days (since 31-15=16 days left in March, but including March15 as day0, the next day is day1. So from March15, adding 30 days.

March15 +30 days:

March: 31 days. So from March15, adding 16 days gets us to March31 (day16).

Then, the remaining 14 days (30-16=14) are in April. So April1 to April14 is 14 days. So adding 14 days to March31 brings us to April14.

So part (c) is April14.

Wait, let me double-check:

March15 +30 days:

March15 to March31: 16 days (including March15 as day0, so March16 is day1, up to March31 as day16).

Then, 30-16=14 days left. So April1 is day17, April14 is day30. So the 30th day is April14. Yes.

So part (c) is April14.

Now part (d): Draft dated October4, payable 6 months after sight. It's accepted on October25. So the maturity is 6 months after October25.

So adding 6 months to October25.

October has 31 days. So adding 6 months:

October to April is 6 months. So October25 +6 months is April25.

Wait, because October25 +6 months is April25. Because each month advances by one. So January, February, March, Aprilâ€”wait, no. Wait, adding 6 months to October:

October +1 month is November, +2 is December, +3 is January, +4 is February, +5 is March, +6 is April. So yes, adding 6 months to October25 brings it to April25.

Wait, but let me check: October25 +6 months is April25, yes.

So part (d) is April25.

Now, compiling all four parts:

(a) January 11

(b) September10

(c) April14

(d) April25

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches these dates.

Looking through the options:

Option J: (a) Jan11, (b) Sep10, (c) Apr14, (d) Apr25. Yes, that's exactly what I have.

Wait, let me check each option:

Option A: (a) Jan12, (b) Sep10, (c) Apr14, (d) Apr26. No, because (a) is Jan12, which I think is wrong.

Option B: (a) Jan12, (b) Sep8, (c) Apr14, (d) Apr23. No.

Option C: (a) Jan10, (b) Sep11, (c) Apr15, (d) Apr26. No.

Option D: (a) Jan12, (b) Sep9, (c) Apr13, (d) Apr24. No.

Option E: (a) Jan11, (b) Sep12, (c) Apr15, (d) Apr26. No, because (b) and (c) are wrong.

Option F: (a) Jan13, (b) Sep10, (c) Apr16, (d) Apr27. No, (a) and (c) wrong.

Option G: (a) Jan11, (b) Sep11, (c) Apr13, (d) Apr24. No, (b) and (c) wrong.

Option H: (a) Jan10, (b) Sep9, (c) Apr15, (d) Apr25. No, (a) and (b) wrong.

Option I: (a) Jan13, (b) Sep12, (c) Apr16, (d) Apr27. No.

Option J: (a) Jan11, (b) Sep10, (c) Apr14, (d) Apr25. Yes, all match.

So the correct option is J.

To determine the maturity dates for the given drafts, we analyze each part as follows:

### (a) Draft dated November 12, payable 60 days after date:
- Starting from November 12 (day 0), we add 60 days.  
- November 12 to November 30 is 18 days.  
- December contributes 31 days, leaving 60 - 18 - 31 = 11 days.  
- Adding 11 days to January 1 brings us to **January 11**.

### (b) Draft dated June 10, payable 3 months after date:
- Adding 3 months to June 10:  
  - June â†’ July (1 month), July â†’ August (2 months), August â†’ September (3 months).  
  - The maturity date is **September 10**.

### (c) Draft dated March 3, payable 30 days after sight, accepted on March 15:
- Starting from March 15 (day 0), we add 30 days.  
- March 15 to March 31 is 16 days.  
- The remaining 14 days fall in April, bringing us to **April 14**.

### (d) Draft dated October 4, payable 6 months after sight, accepted on October 25:
- Starting from October 25 (day 0), we add 6 months.  
- October â†’ November (1 month), November â†’ December (2 months), December â†’ January (3 months), January â†’ February (4 months), February â†’ March (5 months), March â†’ April (6 months).  
- The maturity date is **April 25**.

### Final Maturity Dates:
- (a) January 11  
- (b) September 10  
- (c) April 14  
- (d) April 25  

### Matching with Options:
The only option that matches all four dates is **Option J**:  
- (a) January 11
