Question:

How are whales adapted for their life in cold waters?

Options:

A: They produce heat through rapid movement and have a layer of reflective scales
B: They utilize a bio-antifreeze in their blood to prevent ice crystal formation
C: They have fins for swimming and excrete a special anti-freezing substance
D: They have gills and a streamlined body
E: They have a temperature regulating system and a tremendous amount of subcutaneous fat serving an insulating function.
F: They have specialized lungs that warm incoming cold water
G: They migrate to warmer waters during colder seasons to maintain body temperature
H: They have fur and hibernate in winter

Okay, let's tackle this question about whales and their adaptations to cold water. So, the question is asking how whales are adapted for their life in cold waters. The options are from A to H, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that whales are mammals, not fish. That's an important starting point. Mammals have certain features like being warm-blooded, having hair (though whales don't have much), and producing milk for their young. Since they live in cold environments, their adaptations probably relate to retaining heat.

Looking at the options:

Option A: They produce heat through rapid movement and have reflective scales. Wait, whales don't have scales. They have a thick layer of fat called blubber. So this option is probably wrong because of the scales part.

Option B: Utilize bio-antifreeze in blood. I think some fish have antifreeze proteins to prevent their blood from freezing in icy waters. Do whales have that? I'm not sure. I remember that whales, being mammals, rely more on insulation rather than changing their biochemistry for antifreeze. So maybe B is incorrect.

Option C: Fins for swimming and excrete anti-freeze. Again, excreting anti-freeze doesn't sound right. Plus, I don't think whales excrete such substances. They have fins, but that's not directly an adaptation for cold. So C is probably not correct.

Option D: Gills and streamlined body. No, whales don't have gills. They have lungs and come up to the surface to breathe. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Temperature regulating system and subcutaneous fat for insulation. This sounds plausible. Whales have a thick layer of blubber (which is subcutaneous fat) to keep warm. Also, as mammals, they have a system to regulate their body temperature, maintaining it despite the cold environment. So E looks like a strong candidate.

Option F: Specialized lungs that warm incoming water. I don't think whales take in water. They breathe air, so their lungs warm the air they breathe, not water. So F is probably wrong.

Option G: Migrate to warmer waters. Some whales do migrate to warmer areas for breeding or giving birth, so this is a possible adaptation. But the question is about how they are adapted, not their behavior. So G might be a correct point, but maybe the question is more about physiological adaptations rather than behavioral ones.

Option H: Fur and hibernation. Whales don't have fur beyond maybe some hairs when they're young, and they don't hibernate. Hibernation is more common in land mammals. So H is incorrect.

Now, considering the options, E seems correct because it mentions both a temperature regulating system and subcutaneous fat (blubber) for insulation. G is also a valid point about migration, but the question might be focusing on physiological adaptations rather than migratory behavior.

So the best answer should be E.

The correct answer is E. Whales are adapted to cold waters through a temperature regulating system and a thick layer of subcutaneous fat (blubber) that provides insulation.

Answer: E
