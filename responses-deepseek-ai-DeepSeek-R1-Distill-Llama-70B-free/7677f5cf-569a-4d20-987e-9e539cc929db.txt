Okay, let's tackle this question. Hmm, so we have two identical containers, each filled with a different gas: hydrogen in container 1 and nitrogen in container 2. They're both on a lab table and have reached thermal equilibrium with the room. So the question is about comparing properties of these two gases under these conditions.

First, I need to recall what thermal equilibrium means. Oh right, when two systems are in thermal equilibrium, their temperatures are the same. So both gases are at the same temperature as the room. That's an important point.

Now, looking at the options. The question is about which comparison is correct. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: The pressures can't be compared without knowing the number of molecules. Wait, but the containers are identical. If they're the same size and same temperature, and assuming they have the same amount of gas (like same number of moles), then the pressure would be the same according to the ideal gas law, PV=nRT. But the problem doesn't state that the number of molecules is the same. Oh, but wait, the containers are identical and if they're each filled with their respective gases, maybe they have the same volume. But without knowing n (moles), we can't say the pressures are the same. So A might be correct in saying that you can't compare pressures without knowing n.

Option B: Pressures can't be compared without knowing the temperature. But wait, they're in thermal equilibrium, so the temperature is the same for both. So if we know the temperature, but without knowing n (moles), we can't determine the pressure. So B might not be necessary because the temperature is known to be same, so B could be incorrect.

Option C: Thermal conductivity: I think hydrogen has lower thermal conductivity than nitrogen. Wait, no, wait. I remember that hydrogen has a higher thermal conductivity. Or is it lower? Wait, metals have high thermal conductivity, but for gases, hydrogen has a higher thermal conductivity than nitrogen. Because hydrogen molecules are lighter and maybe move faster, carrying heat better. So if that's the case, C says hydrogen's thermal conductivity is less than nitrogen. That can't be right. So C is incorrect.

Option D: The average force on the container by hydrogen is greater than nitrogen. Force on the container relates to pressure. Since pressure is force per area. If pressure is higher, force would be higher. But earlier, without knowing moles, we can't say P is higher. So D is making a comparison about force without knowing n. So maybe D is incorrect.

Option E: Viscosity of hydrogen is greater than nitrogen. I think lighter gases have lower viscosity. Hydrogen has lower molecular weight than nitrogen, so its viscosity should be lower. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Diffusion rate of hydrogen is less than nitrogen. No, Graham's law says lighter gases diffuse faster. So hydrogen diffuses faster than nitrogen. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Average speed of hydrogen molecules is less than nitrogen. Wait, average speed depends on molecular weight and temperature. Since both are at same T, lighter molecules (H2) should have higher average speed. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Density of hydrogen is less than nitrogen. Yes, because H2 is lighter (lower molecular weight). So H is correct. Because at same T and volume, if n is same, the mass would be lower for H2, so density (mass/volume) would be lower. So H is correct.

Wait, but wait. The question doesn't state that the number of moles is the same. The containers are identical but maybe filled to same pressure? Or same volume? Hmm, the containers are filled but it's not specified whether they're filled to same pressure or same amount. Oh, the problem says each container is filled with a different gas, but it doesn't say anything about the number of moles. So in the absence of that information, maybe we can't compare pressure (as in option A) but for other properties, some can be determined.

Wait, let's think again. The question is about which option correctly compares the properties. So if the containers are identical, perhaps they have the same volume. But the amount (moles) of each gas is not given. So pressure comparison (options A) would require knowing n. So without knowing n, pressure can't be compared. So A is correct.

Wait, but other options may not depend on n. Like density at same T and P would be inversely proportional to molar mass. Because density is (PM)/(RT), with M being molar mass. So if pressure P is same, then since M of H2 is less than N2, density of H2 is less. But wait, are the pressures same? If the containers are filled to same pressure, but the problem doesn't say that. They just say each is filled and allowed to reach thermal equilibrium.

Wait, perhaps the containers are rigid, so same volume, and since T is same, for ideal gases, P is proportional to n. So without knowing n, we can't compare P. So A is correct in that the pressures can't be compared without knowing number of molecules.

But option H: density of H2 is less than N2. Well, density is (mass)/volume. Suppose the volume is same for both containers. Then mass is moles * molar mass. If n is same, then molar mass of H2 is lower, so mass is lower, so density lower. But if n is higher for H2, perhaps the density could be similar. Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify the amount of gas in each container. So without knowing n, can we say anything about density?

Wait, but in the scenario, maybe each container is filled to the same pressure? Because when you fill a container, maybe it's filled to the same pressure as the room? No, that's not stated. So I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the containers are sealed, and the amount of gas is whatever was put in, but we don't know. So without n, can we compare density?

Wait, but regardless of pressure, if the temperatures are same, and assuming ideal gas behavior, the density is (P M)/(R T). So if we don't know P, but for each container, density would be (P1 M1)/(R T) for H2 and (P2 M2)/(R T) for N2. Since T is same, density is proportional to P*M. But without knowing P1 and P2, we can't say. So H's statement that density of H2 is less than N2 may not always be true unless P1 = P2.

Hmm, so perhaps H isn't necessarily correct if the pressures are different.

Wait, but the problem states that each container is set on the table and allowed to reach thermal equilibrium. So the temperature is same. But nothing is said about pressure. So if the containers are sealed, and each filled with a different number of moles, their pressures could be different when they reach room temperature.

So in that case, without knowing more, perhaps the only correct statement is H: the density of hydrogen is less than nitrogen, but wait, that depends on whether the pressure is same. If pressure is same, then yes. Otherwise, not sure.

Alternatively, think about the average kinetic energy. Since both gases are at same T, the average kinetic energy per molecule is same, because kinetic energy depends on temperature. So options I and J are about average kinetic energy. I says H2 has higher kinetic energy, J says N2 does. But both are same. So I and J are incorrect.

Options C, E, F, G might be properties that depend on molar mass. So for thermal conductivity (C), hydrogen's is higher. So C is incorrect. Viscosity (E) is lower for H2, so E is incorrect. Diffusion rate (F) higher for H2, incorrect. Average speed (G) higher for H2, so G is incorrect.

So looking back, which options are left? Option A says pressure can't be compared without knowing moles. Since P = nRT/V. If V is same (containers are identical) and T same, then P is proportional to n. Without knowing n, can't compare P. So A is correct.

But another option, H, says density of H2 is less than N2. Well, if the containers are filled to same pressure, then H would be correct. But if they're filled to same volume and same T, but different moles, then density is (n M)/V. So if n is same, H is correct. But without knowing n, can't say for sure. So perhaps A is the correct answer because without knowing n, we can't compare pressures.

Wait, but the question is about which option is correct. So looking again:

Option A: pressures can't be compared without knowing number of molecules. That's correct because without n, we can't find the pressure. Because P = nRT/V. Since V is same, T is same, so P depends on n. Without knowing n, can't compare.

So the correct answer is A.

Wait, but looking back, the options: option H says the density of H2 is less than N2. If the pressure is same, then yes, because M of H2 is 2 g/mol and N2 is 28, so H2 would have lower density. But if the pressure isn't same, then we can't say. So without knowing P, can't say about density. So H's correctness depends on P being same.

So the only option that is definitely correct is A, because it's about pressure comparison requiring knowing n.

So the answer is A.

To compare the properties of hydrogen and nitrogen gases in two identical containers that have reached thermal equilibrium with the room, we analyze each option carefully:

### Key Analysis of Each Option:
1. **Option A**: The pressures of the gases cannot be compared without knowing the number of molecules in each container.  
   - This is correct because pressure depends on the number of moles (n) of gas, as shown by the ideal gas law \( P = \frac{nRT}{V} \). Since the number of molecules (moles) is not specified, the pressures cannot be directly compared.  

2. **Option B**: The pressures of the gases cannot be compared without knowing the temperature of the room.  
   - This is incorrect because the containers are in thermal equilibrium with the room, meaning both gases are at the same temperature. Thus, temperature is not a limiting factor for comparing pressures.  

3. **Option C**: The thermal conductivity of the hydrogen gas is less than the nitrogen gas.  
   - This is incorrect. Hydrogen has a higher thermal conductivity than nitrogen, as lighter molecules like hydrogen can transfer heat more efficiently.  

4. **Option D**: The average force exerted on the container by the hydrogen gas is greater than the nitrogen gas.  
   - This is incorrect because the average force exerted by a gas is related to pressure, and without knowing the number of moles, the pressures (and thus forces) cannot be compared.  

5. **Option E**: The viscosity of the hydrogen gas is greater than the nitrogen gas.  
   - This is incorrect. Hydrogen, being lighter, has a lower viscosity than nitrogen.  

6. **Option F**: The diffusion rate of the hydrogen gas is less than the nitrogen gas.  
   - This is incorrect. According to Graham's law, lighter gases like hydrogen diffuse faster than heavier gases like nitrogen.  

7. **Option G**: The average speed of the hydrogen gas molecules is less than the nitrogen gas molecules.  
   - This is incorrect. At the same temperature, lighter molecules (hydrogen) have a higher average speed than heavier molecules (nitrogen).  

8. **Option H**: The density of the hydrogen gas is less than the nitrogen gas.  
   - This is conditionally correct. At the same temperature and pressure, hydrogen has a lower density than nitrogen due to its lower molar mass. However, since the problem does not specify whether the pressures are the same, this option is not universally applicable.  

9. **Option I**: The average kinetic energy of the hydrogen gas is greater than the nitrogen gas.  
   - This is incorrect. At the same temperature, the average kinetic energy per molecule is the same for both gases, as kinetic energy depends only on temperature.  

10. **Option J**: The average kinetic energy of the nitrogen gas is greater than the hydrogen gas.  
    - This is also incorrect for the same reason as Option I.  

### Conclusion:
The only option that is definitively correct is **Option A**, as it accurately reflects the limitation of comparing pressures without knowing the number of molecules (moles) in each container.
