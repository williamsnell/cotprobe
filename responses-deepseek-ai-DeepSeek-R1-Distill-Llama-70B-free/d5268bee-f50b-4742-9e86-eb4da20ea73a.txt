Okay, so I've got this probability question here, and I need to figure out which statement about two events A and B is true. I'm a bit rusty on my probability concepts, but let's try to break it down step by step.

The question is asking which of the options (A through J) correctly states something about the probability of events A and B. The options involve various probability expressions and what they imply about the relationship between A and B, specifically whether they're independent or mutually exclusive.

First, I remember that two fundamental concepts in probability are independence and mutual exclusivity. Let me recap:

- **Independent Events**: Two events A and B are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the occurrence of the other. Mathematically, this is expressed as P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B). So if A and B are independent, knowing that A happened doesn't change the probability of B, and vice versa.

- **Mutually Exclusive Events**: Two events A and B are mutually exclusive if they cannot happen at the same time. This means that P(A ∩ B) = 0. So if A occurs, B cannot occur, and vice versa.

Now, looking at the options provided, each option relates a probability statement to a conclusion about independence or mutual exclusivity. I'll go through each option one by one.

Option A: P(A ∪ B) implies events A and B are independent.
Hmm, wait. P(A ∪ B) is the probability that either A or B occurs. The formula for this is P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B). But just knowing P(A ∪ B) doesn't tell us anything specific about whether A and B are independent. Independence is about the product of probabilities, not directly about the union. So I don't think A is correct.

Option B: P(A ∪ B) = 0 implies events A and B are mutually exclusive.
Wait, if P(A ∪ B) is 0, that would mean the probability that either A or B happens is zero. But probabilities can't be negative, and the only way for their union to be zero is if both A and B individually have zero probability. Because if either had a non-zero probability, their union would have at least that probability. So if P(A ∪ B)=0, then both P(A)=0 and P(B)=0. But mutual exclusivity is when P(A ∩ B)=0, not necessarily about their individual probabilities. So this statement doesn't directly imply mutual exclusivity. So B is probably incorrect.

Option C: P(A ∩ B) implies events A and B are independent.
Wait, P(A ∩ B) is just the probability of both A and B occurring. But for independence, we need P(A ∩ B) = P(A)P(B). So just knowing P(A ∩ B) exists doesn't tell us if they're independent unless we know P(A) and P(B) as well. So C is likely incorrect.

Option D: P(A ∪ B) implies events A and B are mutually exclusive.
No, because P(A ∪ B) being a certain value doesn't necessarily mean they're mutually exclusive. For example, if A and B are independent but not mutually exclusive, their union's probability would still be calculable. So D doesn't make sense.

Option E: P(A ∩ B) = 0 implies events A and B are mutually exclusive.
Yes, that sounds right. Because mutual exclusivity is defined as P(A ∩ B) = 0. So if the probability of both happening is zero, they can't happen together. So E looks correct. But let me check the other options to be sure.

Option F: P(A ∩ B) = 1 implies events A and B are independent.
Wait, if P(A ∩ B) is 1, that would mean that both A and B always happen together. So if A happens, B must happen, and vice versa. But independence requires P(A ∩ B) = P(A)P(B). If A and B always happen together, then P(A ∩ B) = P(A) (assuming P(B|A)=1). Unless P(A)=1 and P(B)=1, which would make them trivially independent, but generally, events that always occur together are dependent, not independent. So F is incorrect.

Option G: P(A ∪ B) = 1 implies events A and B are independent.
Hmm, P(A ∪ B) =1 means that either A or B must happen. But that doesn't tell us anything about their independence. They could be dependent or independent. For example, if A and B are the same event, their union is just their individual probability, which could be 1. But they wouldn't be independent in that case. So G is incorrect.

Option H: P(A ∩ B) = 1 implies events A and B are mutually exclusive.
Wait, no. If P(A ∩ B)=1, that means whenever A occurs, B must also occur, and vice versa. So they can't be mutually exclusive because mutual exclusivity requires that they can't both happen. So H is incorrect.

Option I: P(A ∪ B) =1 implies events A and B are mutually exclusive.
No, that's not necessarily true. For example, if A and B are not mutually exclusive but cover all possibilities, their union can still be 1. Like, if you roll a six-sided die, A could be even numbers and B could be odd numbers. But they are mutually exclusive. Wait, but that's a case where P(A ∪ B)=1 and they are mutually exclusive. But another example: suppose A is rolling a 1, 2, or 3, and B is rolling a 2, 3, or 4. Then P(A ∪ B) would include 1,2,3,4, so if 5 and 6 aren't possible, then P(A ∪ B) could be 1, but A and B are not mutually exclusive because 2 and 3 are in both. So in this case, their union is 1, but they're not mutually exclusive. So I is incorrect.

Option J: P(A ∩ B) = 0 implies events A and B are independent.
Wait, earlier I thought that mutual exclusivity is when P(A ∩ B)=0. But does that make them independent? I think not. Let's think: if two events are mutually exclusive and not zero probability, they can't be independent. Because if A happens, B can't happen, so the probability of B given A is zero, which is not equal to P(B) unless P(B)=0. So if both events have non-zero probability, mutual exclusivity implies dependence. So J is incorrect.

Wait, but option E says if P(A ∩ B)=0, then they're mutually exclusive, which is correct. So E is correct.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't misread any options. So the correct answer should be E.

To determine which statement about two events \( A \) and \( B \) is true, we analyze each option based on the concepts of independence and mutual exclusivity:

- **Independent Events**: \( P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B) \). The occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other.
- **Mutually Exclusive Events**: \( P(A \cap B) = 0 \). The events cannot occur simultaneously.

### Analysis of Each Option:

**A**: \( P(A \cup B) \) implies events \( A \) and \( B \) are independent.  
This is incorrect. \( P(A \cup B) \) only gives the probability of either \( A \) or \( B \) occurring, calculated as \( P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) \). It does not provide information about independence.

**B**: \( P(A \cup B) = 0 \) implies events \( A \) and \( B \) are mutually exclusive.  
This is incorrect. If \( P(A \cup B) = 0 \), it means both \( P(A) = 0 \) and \( P(B) = 0 \). Mutual exclusivity is defined by \( P(A \cap B) = 0 \), not \( P(A \cup B) = 0 \).

**C**: \( P(A \cap B) \) implies events \( A \) and \( B \) are independent.  
This is incorrect. \( P(A \cap B) \) alone does not determine independence unless compared to \( P(A) \cdot P(B) \).

**D**: \( P(A \cup B) \) implies events \( A \) and \( B \) are mutually exclusive.  
This is incorrect. \( P(A \cup B) \) does not provide information about mutual exclusivity, which requires \( P(A \cap B) = 0 \).

**E**: \( P(A \cap B) = 0 \) implies events \( A \) and \( B \) are mutually exclusive.  
This is correct. By definition, if \( P(A \cap B) = 0 \), \( A \) and \( B \) cannot occur simultaneously, making them mutually exclusive.

**F**: \( P(A \cap B) = 1 \) implies events \( A \) and \( B \) are independent.  
This is incorrect. If \( P(A \cap B) = 1 \), \( A \) and \( B \) always occur together, making them dependent, not independent.

**G**: \( P(A \cup B) = 1 \) implies events \( A \) and \( B \) are independent.  
This is incorrect. \( P(A \cup B) = 1 \) means \( A \) or \( B \) must occur, but it does not imply independence.

**H**: \( P(A \cap B) = 1 \) implies events \( A \) and \( B \) are mutually exclusive.  
This is incorrect. If \( P(A \cap B) = 1 \), \( A \) and \( B \) always occur together, contradicting mutual exclusivity.

**I**: \( P(A \cup B) = 1 \) implies events \( A \) and \( B \) are mutually exclusive.  
This is incorrect. \( P(A \cup B) = 1 \) does not imply mutual exclusivity, as \( A \) and \( B \) can overlap.

**J**: \( P(A \cap B) = 0 \) implies events \( A \) and \( B \) are independent.  
This is incorrect. If \( P(A \cap B) = 0 \), \( A \) and \( B \) are mutually exclusive, not necessarily independent.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **E**, as \( P(A \cap B) = 0 \) directly implies that \( A \) and \( B \) are mutually exclusive.
