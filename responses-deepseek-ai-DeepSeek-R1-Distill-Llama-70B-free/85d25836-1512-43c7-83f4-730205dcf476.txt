Okay, so I have this question about real GDP increasing and what we can conclude from that. Hmm, I remember that GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product, and real GDP is adjusted for inflation, right? So when real GDP goes up, it means the economy is producing more goods and services in real terms.

The question is asking what we can conclude without a doubt. The options are A through I. Let me go through each one.

Option A says the average wage is higher. Wait, does an increase in GDP necessarily mean wages go up? I'm not sure. I think GDP growth could come from various factors like productivity increases or more workers, but wages might not rise immediately or at all. So A might not be a definite conclusion.

Option B: the national debt is lower. National debt is about government borrowing, right? GDP increasing doesn't directly affect the debt. The government could have a higher GDP but still have high debt if they're borrowing more. So B doesn't necessarily follow.

Option C: production is higher. Oh, that makes sense. GDP measures production, so if real GDP increases, production must be higher. That seems like a direct relationship. So C is a strong candidate.

Option D: prices are higher. Wait, real GDP is adjusted for inflation. So if prices were higher but production didn't increase, nominal GDP would go up, but real GDP might not. So an increase in real GDP doesn't imply higher prices because it's already accounting for inflation. So D isn't necessarily true.

Option E: employment is higher. I think GDP growth often correlates with more employment, but is it a sure thing? Maybe not always. There could be cases where productivity increases lead to higher GDP without more jobs, like through automation. So E isn't a definite conclusion.

Option F: the stock market is higher. The stock market can be influenced by many factors, not just GDP. So even if GDP is up, other factors might cause the market to go down. So F isn't a certain conclusion.

Option G: the trade deficit is lower. Trade deficit depends on imports and exports. GDP includes all domestic production, but an increase in GDP could be due to more exports or more domestic consumption, which might not directly affect the trade deficit. So I don't think G is a sure thing.

Option H: inflation is lower. Real GDP accounts for inflation, so if inflation were higher, real GDP might not increase as much. But an increase in real GDP doesn't directly tell us about inflation rates. It could be that inflation is low, or it could be that high inflation is offset by high real growth. So H isn't a definite conclusion.

Option I: interest rates are higher. Interest rates can be influenced by economic conditions, but they're also controlled by central banks. So higher GDP might lead to higher rates if the economy is overheating, but it's not a certainty. So I isn't a given.

So, putting it all together, the only option that must be true when real GDP increases is C: production is higher.

When real GDP increases, it directly indicates that the economy's production of goods and services has risen in real terms, as real GDP is adjusted for inflation. Among the given options, only Option C ("production is higher") can be conclusively determined without doubt. Other factors like wages, national debt, prices, employment, stock market performance, trade deficit, inflation, and interest rates are influenced by various factors and are not guaranteed to follow from an increase in real GDP.

Answer: C
