Alright, so I've got this question about how many calories a woman should eat each day during pregnancy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Okay, I remember that when a woman is pregnant, her body needs more calories to support the growth of the baby, placenta, and the changes in her body. But I'm not exactly sure how much more.

I think it's not the same for all trimesters. Like, maybe in the beginning, the first trimester, she doesn't need as many extra calories as later on. So maybe the calorie increase happens more in the second and third trimesters.

Wait, I've heard something about an additional 300 calories a day. But when does that start? I think it's not right from the start. So perhaps in the first three months, her calorie needs are similar to before pregnancy, and then they go up.

Looking at the options, option D says an additional 300 kCal in the second and third trimesters only. That sounds familiar. Another option, I think, was 200 extra calories throughout, but I'm not sure if that's accurate.

Wait, no, I think the general recommendation is that during the second and third trimesters, women need about 300 more calories per day. So in the first trimester, they don't need the extra yet. So that would point to option D.

But wait, let me make sure. Some sources might say it's 300 calories in the second and third. Others might have different numbers. Oh, another thoughtâ€”maybe it's 200 calories in the second and 300 in the third? No, I think it's the same amount for both.

So looking back at the options, option D is an additional 300 kCal in the second and third. Does that match what I remember? I think so. So the answer should be D.

The recommended calorie intake for a pregnant woman varies by trimester. In the first trimester, calorie needs are similar to pre-pregnancy levels. During the second and third trimesters, an additional 300 calories per day are typically recommended to support the baby's growth and the mother's bodily changes. 

Option D aligns with this guideline, stating an additional 300 kCal in the second and third trimesters only.
