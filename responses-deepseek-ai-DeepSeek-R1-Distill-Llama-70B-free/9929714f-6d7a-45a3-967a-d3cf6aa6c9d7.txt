Okay, so I've got this question here about a couple who made a deposit on an apartment and then found a better deal. I'm a bit confused about what exactly I'm supposed to do here, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the situation is that the couple put down a non-refundable deposit of $1,000 for the first month's rent on a 6-month lease. The next day, they find another apartment they like just as well, but it's cheaperâ€”$900 a month. They plan to stay for 6 months. The question is whether they should switch to the new apartment.

Hmm. So I think the key here is to compare the total costs of both options and see which one is cheaper. But wait, the first deposit is non-refundable. That means if they switch, they lose that $1,000. So I need to factor that in.

Let's break it down. The original apartment costs $1,000 per month for 6 months. But they've already paid the first month's rent as a deposit. So for the remaining 5 months, they'd pay 5 * $1,000 = $5,000. Plus the initial deposit, the total is $6,000.

Wait, no. Wait. The deposit is for the first month, so they've already paid $1,000. So for the next five months, they pay five times $1,000, which is $5,000. So total is $6,000.

The new apartment is $900 a month, and they're planning to stay for 6 months. So 6 * $900 is $5,400. But they have to consider the $1,000 they already paid for the first place. So if they switch, they lose that $1,000. So the total cost for switching would be the $1,000 (lost deposit) plus $5,400 (new apartment) = $6,400.

Wait, wait a second. Wait, no. Because in the new apartment, they'll have to pay a deposit as well? Or is the $900 just monthly rent without any deposit? The question doesn't mention a deposit on the new place, so maybe we can assume it's just the monthly rent. So the total for the new place is 6 months at $900 each, so $5,400. But they lose the $1,000 they already paid. So total cost would be $5,400 + $1,000 = $6,400.

Comparing the two options: staying in the original apartment costs $6,000, and switching would cost $6,400. So staying is cheaper by $400. So they shouldn't switch because it would cost them more in total.

But wait, is there another way to look at it? Maybe considering the difference per month? Let's see. The original is $1,000 a month, new is $900. So each month, they save $100. Over 5 months remaining (since they've already paid the first month in the original), that's 5 * $100 = $500 saved. But they lose $1,000 by switching. So net loss would be $500 (savings) minus $1,000 (lost deposit) = -$500. So they lose money if they switch.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the initial $1,000 is a sunk cost. Wait, in economics, a sunk cost is money already spent that can't be recovered. So when making decisions, you shouldn't let sunk costs influence you; you should consider future costs only.

So if they switch, they lose the $1,000 but pay less each month. So the future rent for original is 5 months * $1,000 = $5,000. For the new place, it's 6 months * $900 = $5,400. But wait, no. Wait, because they've already paid the first month, so for the original, only 5 months left. But for the new place, they have to pay all 6 months, which is 6*$900 = $5,400. So the difference in future costs is $5,400 (new) versus $5,000 (original). So $5,400 - $5,000 = $400 more if they switch. So the future cost is higher by $400 if they switch.

Therefore, considering only the future costs, staying is better because they save $400. So they should not switch.

But wait, some people might think that since the deposit is non-refundable, it's a loss either way. So the decision is whether the savings over 5 months outweigh the loss of the deposit.

Wait, in this case, the savings per month after the first month is $100. Over 5 months, that's $500. But the deposit is $1,000. So $500 savings vs $1,000 loss. So net loss of $500. So it's not worth switching because the savings aren't enough to cover the loss.

So in both approaches, switching leads to higher total cost. Therefore, they should not switch.

Looking back at the options. The options are labeled A-J with some numbers. The question is asking whether they should switch. But the options don't have yes/no; instead, the options are numerical. Wait, what's the question exactly? Oh, wait, the question says "Should they switch to the new apartment?" but the options are numerical. Wait, perhaps the options represent the net gain or loss if they switch.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the net financial impact of switching. Let's see.

If they switch, their total cost is:

- They lose the $1,000 deposit.

- They pay 6 months at $900: 6*900=5400.

So total cost is 1000 + 5400 = 6400.

If they stay, they have:

- The $1,000 deposit already paid, and 5 more months at $1000: 5*1000=5000.

Total: 1000 +5000=6000.

So, switching would cost 6400, staying 6000. So the difference is 6400-6000=400. So switching costs $400 more.

So the net effect of switching is a loss of $400.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are labeled with various numbers, including negative. Let's read the options again.

Options:

A: 0.0

B: -200.0

C: -100.0

D:50.0

E:100.0

F:1.0

G:-1.0

H:-50.0

I:2.0

J:200.0

Wait, perhaps the question is asking what is the net gain (or loss) if they switch. So in that case, the net would be (new total) minus (original total). So 6400 (switch) vs 6000 (stay). So 6400-6000=400. So switching is more expensive by $400, so the net change is -400.

But none of the options is -400. Hmm. So maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the difference in total rent without considering the sunk cost. Wait, but the sunk cost is real here because it's a non-refundable deposit. So if they switch, they lose that money.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the difference in rent for the remaining 5 months. Let's see.

Original rent per month: $1000.

New rent: $900.

Difference per month: $100.

For 5 months: 5*100=500 saved.

But they lose the $1000 deposit. So net loss is 500 -1000= -500.

So the net financial impact is -$500 if they switch.

Looking at the options, option B is -200, C is -100, etc. None of the options is -500. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me go through it again.

Staying:

- Deposit: $1000 (already paid).

- Remaining 5 months: 5 *1000=5000.

Total: 6000.

Switching:

- Lose deposit: 1000.

- Pay 6 months at 900: 6*900=5400.

Total: 6400.

Difference: 6400 -6000=400. So switching costs an extra $400, so the net change is -400.

But none of the options is -400. So perhaps the question is being approached differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the rent difference for the same period. Let's say they're moving after the first month.

Wait, no. The initial deposit was for the first month, and they've found the new apartment the next day. So they haven't lived there yet. So perhaps for the 6 months, they have to choose between:

Option 1: Pay 6 months at $1000, having already paid the first month as deposit. So total 6000.

Option 2: Switch, lose 1000, pay 6 months at 900: 5400 + 1000=6400.

So difference is 6400-6000=400. So switching is worse by 400.

But options don't have 400. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the question is considering only the monthly difference over the 6 months, without the deposit.

Wait, if the deposit is non-refundable, it's a sunk cost, but perhaps the question is treating it as such. So if we ignore sunk costs, the future rent for the original apartment is 5 months at 1000=5000. The new apartment is 6 months at 900=5400. So the difference is 5400-5000=400. So switching would cost an extra 400 in the future. So net change is -400.

But again, that's not an option.

Wait, could the initial deposit be considered as part of the cost? Like, the original plan was 6 months at 1000, total 6000. The new plan is 6 months at 900, but they lose the 1000 deposit. So total for new is 5400 +1000=6400. So difference is 6400-6000=400.

So the net is a loss of 400. So the correct answer would be the option that represents a loss of 400. But looking at the options, I don't see -400. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the difference in total rent payments excluding the deposit. Let me think.

Original: 6 months at 1000 = 6000.

New: 6 months at 900 = 5400.

Difference: 6000 -5400=600. So if they switch, they save $600. But they lose the $1000 deposit. So net loss: 600-1000= -400.

So again, same as before.

But the options don't have -400. So perhaps the options are considering something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the difference in monthly rent, multiplied by the number of months. So new is cheaper by 100 per month, over 6 months: 6*100=600. But they lose 1000, so net loss is 600-1000= -400.

So maybe the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking back, perhaps the initial deposit is considered as the first month's rent, and the lease is 6 months, so if they switch, they're breaking the lease. But the question doesn't mention any penalties beyond the deposit. So the deposit is the only loss.

Wait, perhaps the question is simpler. They have a 6-month lease, but they've only paid the first month's deposit. So the initial cost is 1000. If they switch, they pay 900 per month for 6 months, but lose the 1000. So total cost: 6*900=5400 +1000=6400.

If they stay, they have 1000 (deposit) +5*1000=5000, total 6000.

So the difference is 6400-6000=400. So switching is worse by 400. So the net change is a loss of 400.

But none of the options is -400. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking what is the amount they should not lose, or perhaps it's considering only the difference in rent.

Wait, another approach: The new apartment is cheaper by 100 per month. Over 6 months, that's 600 saved. But they lose 1000. So net loss is 400. So the correct answer would be -400, but that's not an option.

Looking at the options again, the closest is option B: -200. But that would be if the loss was 200. So perhaps I'm missing a factor here.

Wait, perhaps the lease is 6 months, but they've already paid the first month. So if they switch, they're only paying 5 months in the new place. Let me recalculate.

Wait, no. The new apartment would require a 6-month lease as well, I suppose. So they have to pay all 6 months. So that would be 6*900=5400 plus losing the 1000, total 6400.

But if they stay, they've already paid 1000 and pay 5*1000=5000, total 6000.

So the difference is 400. So the net is -400.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck because none of the options match -400. Wait, perhaps I'm not considering that the deposit is for the first month, so in the original plan, the total is 6000. The new plan is 6*900=5400, but they lose the 1000, so 6400.

Wait, 6400-6000=400. So the net loss is 400. So the correct answer would be -400, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the monthly difference. 100 per month, so 6 months would be 600 saved, but losing 1000. So net loss is 400. So again, same result.

Wait, perhaps the question is only considering the next 5 months, not the initial deposit. Let me check.

If they switch, for the next 5 months, they pay 5*900=4500, plus the initial 1000 lost. So 5500. If they stay, they pay 5*1000=5000. So the difference is 5500 vs 5000: 500 more expensive to switch. So net change is -500.

But again, none of the options is -500.

Wait, maybe the question is simply looking for the difference between the two options in terms of the deposit and the monthly savings. Let's see:

They lose 1000 but save 100 per month for 6 months. So 6*100=600 saved, but losing 1000. So net loss is 400.

So the correct answer would be -400, but it's not an option.

Wait, looking at the options again, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me list all the options:

A:0.0

B:-200.0

C:-100.0

D:50.0

E:100.0

F:1.0

G:-1.0

H:-50.0

I:2.0

J:200.0

Hmm. None of these is 400 or -400.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the deposit is for the first month, so when they switch, that month is already paid, so they don't have to pay the first month in the new apartment. So the new apartment would be 5 months at 900, which is 4500, plus the 1000 lost. So total 5500.

Comparing to staying, which is 6000.

So the difference is 6000-5500=500. So switching saves them 500. So the net gain is 500, but that would mean the answer is E:100.0, but that's not matching.

Wait, no. Wait, if they switch, the first month is already paid in the original apartment, so for the new apartment, they only need to pay 5 months. So 5*900=4500, plus losing the 1000. So total 5500.

Staying: 6000.

So 6000-5500=500 saved by switching. So net gain is 500.

But none of the options is 500. So perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering the rent difference, not the deposit. So 100 per month for 6 months is 600 saved. So the net gain is 600. But again, the options don't have 600.

I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe I should consider that the deposit is non-refundable, so it's a sunk cost and shouldn't be considered. So the future rent is 5 months at 1000=5000 versus 6 months at 900=5400. So 5400>5000, so switching would cost more in the future. So net loss is 400.

But again, no option with 400.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the difference in rent per month on average. 1000 vs 900, so 100 less. So over 6 months, 600 saved. But considering the deposit, net loss is 400.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the net gain or loss if they switch, considering the deposit as a cost. So the net loss would be 400, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it another way: the couple has two options.

Option 1: Stay. They have the initial $1000 deposit and will pay 5 more months at $1000 each. Total: 1000 + (5*1000)=6000.

Option 2: Switch. They lose the $1000 deposit, and pay 6 months at $900 each. Total: 1000 + (6*900)=6400.

So the difference is 6400 -6000=400. So switching costs them an extra $400.

So the net change is a loss of $400. So the answer would be -400, but it's not in the options. So perhaps the options are considering a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the net present value or something else, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the average monthly difference. 100 less per month times 6 months is 600, minus 1000 deposit loss, net loss 400. So again, same result.

I'm not seeing the correct option here. Wait, perhaps the question is simpler and I'm overcomplicating. Let me read it again.

The question is whether they should switch. The options are labeled A-J but with numerical values. So perhaps the correct answer is the one that represents the net loss if they switch. So from the earlier calculation,
