Okay, so I need to solve this thermodynamics problem. Hmm, let's see what the question is asking. 

The problem says that heat is transferred to steam in a cylinder. The pressure is constant, so this must be a constant-pressure process. The volume is given as 2 ft³, and the pressure is 50 lbf/in². Oh wait, wait, lbf or lbf per square inch? The question says 50 lbf in a cylinder, so maybe it's 50 lbf total force? No, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, no, in steam tables, pressure is in lbf/in², so maybe it's 50 lbf/in². That makes more sense. So P = 50 psi.

The temperature rises from 300°F to 500°F. So it's a heating process at constant pressure. Since the system is closed, the mass doesn't change, but the steam can expand or contract, doing work.

Part (a) is the heat transfer, (b) the work done, and (c) the change in internal energy. I remember that for a constant pressure process, the heat transfer Q is equal to the change in enthalpy (ΔH), because Q = ΔU + W, and W = PΔV. But for constant pressure, ΔH = Q = ΔU + PΔV. 

Wait, no, wait. The first law is ΔU = Q - W, where W is work done by the system. So Q = ΔU + W. And for a constant pressure process, the work done W is PΔV. Also, the enthalpy change ΔH is equal to Q when pressure is constant because ΔH = Q when the process is isobaric.

So, for part (a), the heat transfer Q would be the change in enthalpy of the steam. So I need to find the enthalpy per pound of steam at the initial and final states, multiply by the mass, and take the difference.

Wait, but I don't know the mass. Since the volume is given, I can find the mass using the specific volume. Because at a given pressure and temperature, the specific volume (v) is known from the steam tables. So v = V/m, so m = V/v.

So first, I need to find the specific volume at the initial state (50 psi, 300°F) and the final state (50 psi, 500°F). Then, calculate the mass m = V/v. But wait, wait, the volume might change because the temperature increases. But since it's a closed system, the mass remains the same. So for the initial state, the specific volume v1 is at 50 psi and 300°F. And the final state's specific volume v2 is at 50 psi and 500°F.

Wait, but wait, in a constant pressure process in a closed system, does the volume change? Oh yes, because when you heat the steam, it expands. But since the system is closed, the mass is fixed, so the volume would increase because specific volume increases.

Wait no, in a closed system, the mass is fixed, but the volume can change if it's a piston or something. So the volume changes from V1 to V2, but the pressure remains constant. So the work done is P*(V2 - V1). But the problem gives the volume as 2 ft³. Wait, wait, the volume is given as 2 ft³. So is that the initial volume? Because the process is from 300°F to 500°F, so the initial volume is 2 ft³.

So, initial state: P = 50 psi, T1 = 300°F, V1 = 2 ft³.

Final state: P = 50 psi, T2 = 500°F, V2 = ?

So, first, find the specific volume at initial and final states.

Looking up steam tables for P=50 psi. I don't remember exact values, but I'll try to think. At 50 psi (which is about 35 kPa? Wait, no, 50 psi is approximately 345 kPa because 1 psi is about 6.89 kPa). So in steam tables, 50 psi is a higher pressure than atmospheric.

At 50 psi, saturated steam (boiling point) is at around 281°F. So when the temperature is 300°F, it's superheated. Similarly, 500°F is also superheated.

So for the initial state: P=50 psi, T=300°F. Looking up superheated steam tables at 50 psi.

Hmm, I think at 50 psi, the saturation temperature is about 281.5°F. So 300°F is superheated. Let me try to recall the values.

At 50 psi, superheated steam at 300°F:

v1 (specific volume) is about 4.23 ft³/lbm? Wait, no, wait that doesn't sound right. Wait, specific volume is volume per unit mass. For steam, it's usually in cubic feet per pound mass. So at 50 psi, 300°F, I think v is around 4.23 ft³/lbm. Wait, but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's 0.0177? No, that's for liquid. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think: at 50 psi, the specific volume of saturated vapor is about 26.8 ft³/lbm (I think), but at higher temperatures, it's larger.

Wait, I'm probably mixing up units. Let me try to think more clearly. The specific volume of saturated vapor at 50 psi is around 4.43 ft³/lbm? Or is it higher? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look up the exact values, but since I can't do that, I'll need to proceed with my best estimates. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the ideal gas equation, but steam doesn't behave ideally, especially at lower pressures. But at 50 psi, it's a moderate pressure, so maybe the ideal gas is a decent approximation.

Wait, but the problem gives us the volume as 2 ft³, so perhaps it's better to calculate m (mass) using the ideal gas law? Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's accurate for steam.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the steam behaves as an ideal gas. Let's try that approach. The ideal gas law is PV = mRT.

Wait, but I need to use consistent units. Let's see: P is 50 psi, which is 50 lbf/in². To convert that to pounds-force per square foot, since 1 ft² = 144 in², so 50 psi = 50 * 144 = 7200 lbf/ft².

Volume V is 2 ft³.

Temperature T is in absolute units, so for the initial state, T1 = 300°F = 460 + 300 = 760 R.

R is the gas constant. For air or ideal gas, R = 53.35 ft·lbf/(lbm·R). But steam has a different R. The specific gas constant R for steam (molecular weight 18) is R = 53.35 / 18 ≈ 2.96 ft·lbf/(lbm·R).

So applying ideal gas law: PV = mRT.

So m = PV/(RT).

Plugging in the numbers:

P = 7200 lbf/ft².

V = 2 ft³.

R = 2.96 ft·lbf/(lbm·R).

T1 = 760 R.

So m = (7200 * 2) / (2.96 * 760).

Calculate denominator: 2.96 *760 ≈ 2249.6.

Numerator: 7200 * 2 = 14400.

m ≈ 14400 / 2249.6 ≈ approximately 6.4 lbm.

Wait, but this is under the initial state. Now, the specific volume v is V/m. So v1 = 2 ft³ / 6.4 lbm ≈ 0.3125 ft³/lbm.

Wait, that seems low for steam at 50 psi and 300°F. Because earlier I thought v is about 4.23 ft³/lbm. Hmm, that's a big discrepancy. So perhaps the ideal gas assumption isn't valid here. Maybe I should use steam table values.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the ideal gas approach and see where that takes me. Let's try to proceed.

So initial mass m ≈ 6.4 lbm.

Now, for the final state, T2 is 500°F, which is 500 + 460 = 960 R.

Using the same pressure, P = 7200 lbf/ft².

Now, using PV = mRT for the final state, we can find V2.

V2 = m R T2 / P.

Plugging in the numbers:

V2 = (6.4 lbm) * (2.96 ft·lbf/(lbm·R)) * 960 R) / 7200 lbf/ft².

Calculate numerator: 6.4 * 2.96 = approx 18.944. 18.944 * 960 ≈ 18174.  So numerator ≈ 18174 ft·lbf.

Divide by denominator 7200 lbf/ft²: 18174 /7200 ≈ 2.525 ft³.

So V2 ≈ 2.525 ft³.

So the change in volume ΔV = V2 - V1 = 2.525 - 2 = 0.525 ft³.

So work done W = PΔV. But wait, in the first law, work done by the system is W = P_ext ΔV. Since the pressure is constant, W = P (V2 - V1).

But wait, the units for work would be in foot-pounds. Let's compute:

P = 7200 lbf/ft².

ΔV = 0.525 ft³.

So W = 7200 * 0.525 = 3780 ft·lbf.

But we need to convert that to Btu. I remember that 1 Btu is approximately 778 ft·lbf. So:

W = 3780 / 778 ≈ approx 4.86 Btu.

Wait, but wait, the options don't have a 4.86 Btu for part (b). Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating m. Let me recalculate m.

Calculating m again with P=7200 lbf/ft², V=2 ft³, T=760 R, R=2.96.

m = (7200 * 2) / (2.96 * 760).

7200 * 2 = 14400.

2.96 *760: 2.96 *700 = 2072, 2.96 *60= 177.6. Total 2072 +177.6= 2249.6.

So m=14400 /2249.6≈6.4 lbm. That seems correct.

Then, V2 = (6.4 *2.96 *960) /7200.

6.4 *2.96 = 18.944.

18.944 *960 = let's compute:

18 *960 = 17280,

0.944 *960 ≈ 905. So total ≈18185.

Divide by 7200: 18185/7200 ≈2.526 ft³.

ΔV=0.526 ft³.

W=7200 *0.526 = 3787.2 ft·lbf.

Convert to Btu: 3787.2 /778 ≈4.867 Btu. Approximately 4.87 Btu.

Looking at the options, option E has (b) 5.54, option B (b)4.12, option A (5.34), option H (4.34). Hmm, none of them exactly match 4.87. So maybe the ideal gas approach isn't the intended method here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use steam table data. Let me think about that.

Steam tables provide enthalpy (h) and specific volume (v) at given states.

At 50 psi, let's find the superheated steam properties.

Wait, but without the exact table, I have to rely on memory. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the values.

At 50 psi (absolute?), but usually steam tables are in absolute pressure. Wait, no, 50 psi could be gauge or absolute, but I think in this case, it's absolute because that's standard in steam tables.

Wait, no, sometimes in practice, it's gauge pressure. But in thermodynamics, absolute pressure is standard. So 50 psi would be 50 psi above vacuum, so absolute.

At 50 psi (abs), T=300°F: superheated steam.

Looking up steam tables for 50 psi, 300°F.

I think the specific volume v1 is around 4.23 ft³/lbm.

Similarly, at 50 psi, 500°F, v2 would be higher, say around 5.03 ft³/lbm.

So the specific volume increases with temperature at constant pressure.

So then, the mass m can be found from the initial state. V1 = 2 ft³ = m * v1.

So m = V1 / v1 = 2 /4.23 ≈0.473 lbm.

Wait, that's much less than the 6.4 lbm I calculated earlier. Hmm, but this makes sense because steam at higher specific volume (v) would mean less mass. So perhaps the ideal gas approach was wrong, and the correct approach is to use steam tables.

So proceeding with steam tables:

m = V1 / v1 = 2 ft³ / 4.23 ft³/lbm ≈ 0.473 lbm.

Similarly, at the final state, v2 =5.03 ft³/lbm.

So the final volume V2 = m * v2 = 0.473 *5.03 ≈2.379 ft³.

So ΔV = V2 - V1 =2.379 - 2 =0.379 ft³.

Then, work done W = P ΔV.

But P is 50 psi, which is 50 lbf/in². To convert to lbf/ft²: 50 *144=7200 lbf/ft².

ΔV in ft³:0.379 ft³.

So W =7200 *0.379 =2736.8 ft·lbf.

Convert to Btu: 2736.8 /778 ≈3.518 Btu.

Hmm, but looking at the options, part (b) is work done. Let's see the options:

Option B: (b)4.12

Option A: (b)5.34

Option E: (b)5.54

Option H: (b)4.34

Hmm, 3.5 is not matching any. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in specific volume values.

Wait, maybe I should recheck the specific volumes.

Wait, I'm a bit unsure about the exact values. Let me think again: at 50 psi, 300°F.

From steam tables, the saturation temperature is about 281.5°F. So at 300°F, it's superheated.

Looking up superheated steam table at 50 psi:

At 300°F, v ≈ 4.23 ft³/lbm.

At 500°F, v ≈5.03 ft³/lbm.

So these seem correct.

Then, m=2/4.23≈0.473 lbm.

V2=0.473 *5.03≈2.379 ft³.

ΔV=0.379 ft³.

W= PΔV=50 psi *0.379 ft³.

But wait, 50 psi is 7200 psf, so 7200 lb/ft² * 0.379 ft³ = 7200 *0.379 = 2730 lb·ft.

Convert to Btu: 2730 /778 ≈3.51 Btu.

But the options don't have 3.51. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in approach.

Wait, but the problem states that the system is closed, so mass is constant. So perhaps the process is a constant volume process? No, because the volume changes as the steam expands. Wait, no, in a closed system, the volume can change if it's a cylinder with a piston that can move. So the system's volume can expand, so it's a constant pressure process, but the volume isn't fixed.

So, maybe I need to calculate the work done as P*(V2 - V1), which I did as 3.51 Btu, but this isn't matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the change in internal energy and heat transfer using steam tables.

So, part (a) is Q, which is the change in enthalpy ΔH, since Q = ΔH at constant pressure.

Wait, no, no. For a constant pressure process, Q is the heat added, which is ΔH. So Q = m (h2 - h1).

So I need to find h1 and h2 from the steam tables.

At 50 psi, 300°F: h1 is the enthalpy.

Similarly, at 50 psi, 500°F: h2.

Looking up the values.

At 50 psi, 300°F: h1 ≈ 1205.3 Btu/lbm.

At 50 psi, 500°F: h2≈1300.7 Btu/lbm.

So Δh = h2 - h1 = 1300.7 -1205.3 =95.4 Btu/lbm.

So Q = m * Δh =0.473 lbm *95.4 ≈45.17 Btu.

Wait, that's way higher than any of the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the h values are actually in the thousands. Wait, no, 1200 Btu/lbm seems high, but maybe that's correct.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think: at 50 psi, the saturation enthalpy is around h_f = 298.6 Btu/lbm, h_g=  2648.1 Btu/lbm. But since the steam is superheated, the h is higher than h_g.

Wait, but wait that doesn't make sense. At 50 psi, the saturation temperature is 281.5°F. So at 300°F, it's superheated, so h would be higher than h_g=2648.1? Wait, no. Wait, I'm getting this wrong. Wait, no, higher temperature beyond saturation point in superheated region, so h is higher than h_g.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up the enthalpy values. Let me try again.

In steam tables, for saturated steam at 50 psi:

h_f = 298.6 Btu/lbm (enthalpy of saturated liquid),

h_fg = 888.5 Btu/lbm (latent
