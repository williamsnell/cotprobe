Okay, so I have this question about brief crisis-oriented therapy, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that crisis therapy is usually short-term and focused on resolving immediate problems. The goal is to help the client get through the crisis quickly rather than explore long-term issues. So the therapy is time-limited and goal-oriented.

Looking at the options, I should consider what each option is suggesting and whether it aligns with what I know about crisis therapy.

Option A: Avoid setting any specific goals to maintain flexibility. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. I thought crisis therapy is more structured, with clear goals because it's time-limited. So probably not A.

Option B: Focus on developing a deep understanding of the crisis before setting goals. Wait, if they focus too much on understanding before setting goals, that might take too long. Crisis therapy is supposed to be brief, so maybe B isn't correct because it suggests spending more time on understanding before acting.

Option C: Try to ensure the client becomes calm and relaxed. While making the client calm might be part of it, I don't think that's the defining characteristic. It's more about solving the immediate problem, not just relaxation.

Option D: Agree upon clear-cut goals and keep sessions focused on these goals. This sounds more accurate. Since it's brief and crisis-oriented, having clear goals makes sense to stay on track and resolve the issue quickly.

Option E: Primarily use medication. I don't think crisis therapy relies mainly on meds. It's more about psychological intervention. So E is probably not correct.

Option F: Encourage clients to disregard issues until later. That seems counterproductive. Crisis therapy is about addressing the immediate problem, not putting it off.

Option G: Focus on building long-term coping mechanisms. Since it's brief, the focus is more on the immediate crisis, not long-term strategies. So G doesn't fit.

Option H: Rely on group therapy. I'm not sure, but I think crisis therapy is often individual, especially in the initial stages. Group might not be the primary approach here.

Option I: Explore early childhood experiences. That sounds more like long-term psychotherapy, not brief crisis intervention. So I isn't right.

Option J: Be open and nondirective. Crisis therapy is usually more directive because there's a specific problem to solve quickly. So J doesn't fit either.

Putting it all together, the most characteristic feature of brief crisis-oriented therapy is agreeing on clear goals and keeping sessions focused on those. So the correct answer should be D.

The correct answer is D: agree upon clear-cut goals and keep the sessions focused on these goals. This aligns with the nature of brief crisis-oriented therapy, which is structured, time-limited, and focused on resolving immediate issues efficiently.

Answer: D
