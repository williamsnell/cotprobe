Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the sum of an infinite series. The series is 1/2^1 + 2/2^2 + 3/2^3 + ... and so on. Hmm, I remember that this is a type of arithmetic-geometric series because each term is a combination of an arithmetic sequence (the numerator) and a geometric sequence (the denominator).

Wait, right, an arithmetic sequence increases by a constant difference, which here is 1 each time (like 1, 2, 3, ...), and the geometric part has a common ratio, here 1/2 because each term is multiplied by 1/2. So the general term is k/(2^k).

I think the standard approach for such series is to use generating functions or maybe a clever algebraic manipulation. Let me try the algebraic method because I think it's more straightforward for me.

Let's denote the sum as S. So,

S = 1/2 + 2/2² + 3/2³ + 4/2⁴ + ... 

I remember that if we multiply both sides by the common ratio, which is 1/2 here, we get:

(1/2) S = 1/2² + 2/2³ + 3/2⁴ + 4/2⁵ + ... 

Now, if I subtract this new equation from the original S, what happens?

S - (1/2)S = (1/2 + 2/2² + 3/2³ + ...) - (1/2² + 2/2³ + 3/2⁴ + ...)

On the left side, that's (1 - 1/2) S = (1/2) S.

On the right side, let's subtract term by term. The first term is 1/2, then the rest: 2/2² - 1/2² = (2-1)/2² = 1/2². Similarly, 3/2³ - 2/2³ = 1/2³, and so on. So each term after the first becomes 1/(2^k) where k starts from 2.

So,

(1/2) S = 1/2 + 1/2² + 1/2³ + 1/2⁴ + ... 

Wait, that's a geometric series. The first term is 1/2, and each subsequent term is multiplied by 1/2. The sum of an infinite geometric series is a/(1 - r), where a is the first term and r is the common ratio.

So the sum on the right is (1/2) / (1 - 1/2) ) = (1/2) / (1/2) ) = 1.

Therefore, (1/2) S = 1, so S = 2.

Wait, but let me double-check that. So S is 2. Looking at the options, option A is 2, so that should be the correct answer.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the algebra. Let me go through the steps again.

Start with S = sum from k=1 to infinity of k/(2^k).

Multiply both sides by 1/2:

(1/2) S = sum from k=1 to infinity of k/(2^{k+1})}.

Which can be rewritten as sum from k=1 to infinity of k/(2^{k} * 2) ) = sum from k=1 to infinity of k/(2^{k+1}) ).

Alternatively, shifting the index: Let m = k+1, but maybe that's complicating. Alternatively, subtract.

When I subtract (1/2 S) from S, I get:

S - (1/2 S) = (1/2) S = [1/2 + 2/4 + 3/8 + ...] - [1/4 + 2/8 + 3/16 + ...].

Subtracting each corresponding term:

1/2 remains as is.

Then, 2/4 - 1/4 = 1/4.

3/8 - 2/8 = 1/8.

4/16 - 3/16 = 1/16.

So the right side becomes 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + ... which is a geometric series with a=1/2 and r=1/2.

Sum is (1/2)/(1 - 1/2) ) = 1.

So (1/2) S = 1 → S=2. Yep, that seems correct.

So the answer should be option A: 2.

To evaluate the sum 

\[
S = \frac{1}{2^1} + \frac{2}{2^2} + \frac{3}{2^3} + \cdots + \frac{k}{2^k} + \cdots,
\]

we start by recognizing that this is an arithmetic-geometric series, where the numerator forms an arithmetic sequence and the denominator forms a geometric sequence. Let the sum be denoted as \( S \). Then:

\[
S = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{2^2} + \frac{3}{2^3} + \frac{4}{2^4} + \cdots.
\]

Next, multiply both sides by the common ratio \( \frac{1}{2} \):

\[
\frac{1}{2}S = \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{2}{2^3} + \frac{3}{2^4} + \cdots.
\]

Now subtract this new equation from the original \( S \):

\[
S - \frac{1}{2}S = \frac{1}{2} + \left(\frac{2}{2^2} - \frac{1}{2^2}\right) + \left(\frac{3}{2^3} - \frac{2}{2^3}\right) + \left(\frac{4}{2^4} - \frac{3}{2^4}\right) + \cdots.
\]

Simplifying the left side gives:

\[
\frac{1}{2}S.
\]

On the right side, subtracting term by term results in:

\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{2^3} + \frac{1}{2^4} + \cdots.
\]

This is an infinite geometric series with the first term \( \frac{1}{2} \) and common ratio \( \frac{1}{2} \). The sum of this geometric series is:

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{2}}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{1}{2}} = 1.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{2}S = 1 \implies S = 2.
\]

Therefore, the sum of the series is \( 2 \), and the correct answer is:

**A: 2**
