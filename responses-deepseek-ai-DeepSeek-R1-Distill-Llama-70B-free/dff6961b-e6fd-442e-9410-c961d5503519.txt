Okay, so I've got this question about the atomic nucleus and electrical forces. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. Alright, the question is asking what electrical forces tend to do in the nucleus. The options are A to J.

I remember that the nucleus is made up of protons and neutrons. Protons are positively charged, right? So when you have positive charges close together, what happens? Oh yeah, like charges repel each other. That's Coulomb's law. So the electrical force between protons would push them apart. But wait, the nucleus doesn't fly apart, so there must be another force holding it together. Oh right, the strong nuclear force. But the question is specifically about electrical forces.

So looking at the options, let's go through them. Option G says "push particles apart". That makes sense because the protons are positively charged and would repel each other. So electrical forces would cause them to push apart.

Wait, are there any other options that might fit? Let me check the others quickly. Option I says "hold particles together"â€”no, that's the strong force. Option J is about attracting, which isn't right because protons repel. Option F is charge particles, but protons are already charged. Option G seems correct.

In the atomic nucleus, protons are positively charged particles. According to Coulomb's law, like charges repel each other, meaning the electrical forces between protons tend to push them apart. While the strong nuclear force is responsible for holding the nucleus together, the question specifically asks about electrical forces. Therefore, the correct answer is that electrical forces push particles apart.

Answer: G
