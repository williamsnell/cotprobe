Question:

The managers of Disney World are considering changing the amount charged on their Humpty Dumpty ride. Presently they charge 25 cents a mile and this results in about 6,000 passengers each day. The managers believe the number of daily passengers will rise by 400 for each 1 cent decrease in the admission charge and drop by 400 for each 1 cent increase. What is the admission charge which maximizes the daily revenue?

Options:

A: 30 cents
B: 22 cents
C: 18 cents
D: 10 cents
E: 12 cents
F: 25 cents
G: 15 cents
H: 35 cents
I: 20 cents
J: 28 cents

Okay, so I've got this problem about Disney World's Humpty Dumpty ride, and I need to find the admission charge that maximizes daily revenue. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on some of these economics concepts, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the current situation is that they charge 25 cents per ride, and they get about 6,000 passengers each day. Now, the managers think that if they decrease the price by 1 cent, the number of passengers goes up by 400. Conversely, if they increase the price by a cent, the passengers drop by 400. So, I guess the relationship between price and quantity is linear here.

My goal is to find the price that maximizes revenue. Revenue, as I remember, is the product of price and quantity. So Revenue (R) = Price (P) * Quantity (Q). 

Let's define the variables. Let’s let x be the number of cents they change the price. So, the new price P would be 25 + x cents. Wait, no. Because if x is positive, that means they increased the price by x cents, and if x is negative, it's a decrease. So, P = 25 + x.

Now, the quantity Q depends on x too. Currently, at x=0, Q is 6,000. For each 1 cent decrease (x negative), Q increases by 400. For each 1 cent increase (x positive), Q decreases by 400. So, the change in quantity is -400 times x, right? Because if x is positive (price up), Q goes down by 400x. If x is negative (price down), Q goes up by 400|x|. So, Q = 6000 - 400x.

Wait, let me make sure. If x is +1 (price increases by 1 cent), Q would drop by 400, so Q=6000-400*(1) = 5600. If x is -1 (price drops by 1 cent), Q would be 6000 +400*(1)=6400. Yes, that makes sense. So, Q = 6000 - 400x.

So, putting it all together, Revenue R = P * Q = (25 + x) * (6000 - 400x).

I need to express R in terms of x and find its maximum. So, expand this:

R = (25 + x)(6000 - 400x) 
= 25*6000 + 25*(-400x) + x*6000 + x*(-400x)
= 150000 - 10000x + 6000x -400x²
Combine like terms: 
-10000x +6000x = -4000x
So, R = 150000 -4000x -400x²

Alternatively, R = -400x² -4000x +150000.

This is a quadratic equation in terms of x, and since the coefficient of x² is negative (-400), the parabola opens downward, meaning the vertex is the maximum point.

The vertex of a parabola given by ax² + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a). So, in this case, a = -400, b = -4000.

Plugging into the formula:

x = -b/(2a) = -(-4000)/(2*(-400)) ) 

Calculate that. So numerator is 4000, denominator is 2*(-400) = -800.

So, x = 4000 / (-800) = -5.

Wait, so x is -5. That means the price change is -5 cents. So the optimal price is 25 + (-5) = 20 cents.

So the admission charge that maximizes revenue is 20 cents.

Looking back at the options, option I is 20 cents. So the answer should be I.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to be sure. Let me recalculate R as a function of x and find where it's maximum.

Another way to approach this is to find the derivative of R with respect to x and set it to zero. Since R is a quadratic function, the derivative would be a linear function, and setting it to zero gives the maximum.

R = -400x² -4000x +150000.

dR/dx = -800x -4000. Setting this to zero:

-800x -4000 = 0
=> -800x = 4000
=> x = 4000 / (-800) = -5.

Same result. So x=-5. So optimal price is 25 -5 = 20 cents.

Yes, that confirms it. So option I is correct.

To determine the admission charge that maximizes daily revenue for Disney World's Humpty Dumpty ride, we start by defining the variables. Let \( x \) represent the number of cents by which the price is changed. The current price is 25 cents, so the new price \( P \) is:

\[
P = 25 + x
\]

The quantity of passengers \( Q \) is currently 6,000 when \( x = 0 \). For each 1-cent decrease in price (\( x < 0 \)), \( Q \) increases by 400, and for each 1-cent increase in price (\( x > 0 \)), \( Q \) decreases by 400. Thus, the relationship for \( Q \) is:

\[
Q = 6000 - 400x
\]

Revenue \( R \) is the product of price and quantity:

\[
R = P \cdot Q = (25 + x)(6000 - 400x)
\]

Expanding this equation:

\[
R = (25)(6000) + (25)(-400x) + (x)(6000) + (x)(-400x)
\]
\[
R = 150000 - 10000x + 6000x - 400x^2
\]
\[
R = 150000 - 4000x - 400x^2
\]

This is a quadratic equation of the form \( R = -400x^2 - 4000x + 150000 \), where the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is negative, indicating that the parabola opens downward and the vertex represents the maximum revenue. The vertex of a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c \) occurs at:

\[
x = -\frac{b}{2a}
\]

Here, \( a = -400 \) and \( b = -4000 \). Substituting these values:

\[
x = -\frac{-4000}{2(-400)} = -\frac{4000}{-800} = -5
\]

Thus, \( x = -5 \), meaning the optimal price change is a decrease of 5 cents. The new price is:

\[
P = 25 + (-5) = 20 \, \text{cents}
\]

Verifying this result using calculus, the derivative of \( R \) with respect to \( x \) is:

\[
\frac{dR}{dx} = -800x - 4000
\]

Setting \( \frac{dR}{dx} = 0 \):

\[
-800x - 4000 = 0
\]
\[
-800x = 4000
\]
\[
x = \frac{4000}{-800} = -5
\]

This confirms that \( x = -5 \), leading to the same optimal price of 20 cents.

From the given options, the admission charge that maximizes daily revenue is **20 cents**, which corresponds to option **I**.
