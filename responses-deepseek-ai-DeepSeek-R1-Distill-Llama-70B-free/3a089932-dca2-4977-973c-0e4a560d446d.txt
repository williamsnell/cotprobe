Okay, I have this multiple-choice question about which of the given options is a state. The options are A through H, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I'll go through each option one by one to understand their status. Let's start by recalling what a state is in the context of international law. A state is typically defined as a sovereign entity with defined territory, permanent population, a government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other states. So, the key here is sovereignty.

Option A: American Samoa. I remember that American Samoa is a territory of the United States. It's not independent; the US government has jurisdiction over it. So it's not a state but a territory.

Option B: Hong Kong. Hong Kong is a Special Administrative Region of China. It has a high degree of autonomy but is not an independent country. It operates under the "one country, two systems" principle, so it's not a state on its own.

Option C: Gibraltar. Gibraltar is a British Overseas Territory. It's under the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom. While it has some self-governance, it doesn't have full sovereignty, so it's not a state.

Option D: Greenland. Greenland is a bit tricky. It's an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark. It has self-rule in most areas except defense and foreign affairs, which are handled by Denmark. So, it's not fully independent and thus not a state.

Option E: Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is a Commonwealth of the United States. It's a US territory with some autonomy, but it doesn't have the status of an independent state. Residents are US citizens, but Puerto Rico doesn't have sovereignty.

Option F: Bermuda. Bermuda is another British Overseas Territory. It has a certain level of self-governance but remains under British jurisdiction. So, it's not a state.

Option G: Antarctica. Antarctica isn't a country or a state. It's a continent governed by the Antarctic Treaty System, which doesn't recognize any country's sovereignty there. So, no state status here.

Option H: Egypt. Egypt is a country located in northeastern Africa. It's fully recognized as a sovereign state by the international community. It has defined borders, a permanent population, a government, and the ability to engage in diplomatic relations.

Putting it all together, the only option that fits the definition of a state is H: Egypt. All the others are territories, regions, or have some form of governance that doesn't equate to full state sovereignty.

The only entity among the options that is a state is Egypt, as it is a fully recognized sovereign country with defined territory, permanent population, a government, and the capacity to engage in international relations.

Answer: H
