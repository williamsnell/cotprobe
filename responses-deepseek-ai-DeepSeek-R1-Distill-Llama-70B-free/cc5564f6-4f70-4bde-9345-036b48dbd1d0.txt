Okay, so I have this problem about thermometers and temperature scales. Hmm, the question is about finding the temperature when both a Fahrenheit and Celsius thermometer show the same numerical reading, and another part where Fahrenheit is twice the Celsius. Then I have to express the results in Rankine and Kelvin.

Let me start with part a. So, when the numerical readings are the same. That means the temperature in Celsius equals the temperature in Fahrenheit. But wait, that's only possible at a specific point I remember. I think it's around -40 degrees because that's a common point where both scales meet. So, Tc equals Tf. Yeah, I remember that at -40°C, it's also -40°F. That makes sense because the conversion formula between them is F = (9/5)C + 32. So if F = C, then I can set them equal.

Let me write that equation out. So, F = C. Substituting into the formula: C = (9/5)C + 32. Wait, that can't be right. Let me rearrange. Let me subtract (9/5)C from both sides. So, C - (9/5)C = 32. That's (-4/5)C = 32. Multiply both sides by (-5/4), so C = 32*(-5/4) = -40. So yeah, -40 degrees. So that's part a.

Now, converting that to Rankine and Kelvin. I remember that Rankine is Fahrenheit plus 459.67. So, -40 F + 459.67 = 419.67. Wait, but the options have 420, 400, etc. So probably rounding, so 420 Rankine. For Kelvin, it's Celsius plus 273.15. So, -40 + 273.15 is 233.15, which would be 233.33 when rounded. So part a's answer should be -40°C or -40°F, with T_R=420 and T_K=233.33.

Now part b: Fahrenheit is twice Celsius. So, F = 2C. And I need to find the temperature. Let's use the conversion formula again. F = (9/5)C +32. But since F is 2C, substitute that in: 2C = (9/5)C +32.

Let me solve for C. Subtract (9/5)C from both sides: 2C - (9/5)C = 32. Let's convert 2C to fifths: 10/5 C - 9/5 C = (1/5)C =32. So C = 32 *5 = 160°C. Then F would be 2 *160 = 320°F.

Now convert these to Rankine and Kelvin. Rankine is F + 459.67, so 320 + 459.67 is 779.67, which rounds to 780. Kelvin is C + 273.15, so 160 +273.15= 433.15, which is 433.33 when rounded.

So looking at the options, let's see.

Option A: a) -40, T_R=420, T_K=233.33; b) TC=160, TF=320, T_R=780, T_K=433.33. That matches what I got. So option A looks correct.

I should check the other options quickly. Option B for part a has -30, which is wrong. Option C's part a is correct, but part b has TC=170, which doesn't match. Option D's part a has T_R=400, which is lower than our 420, so wrong. So yes, the correct option is A.

To solve the problem, we analyze the two conditions separately:

### Part (a): Identical Numerical Readings in Fahrenheit and Celsius
When the numerical readings in Fahrenheit (°F) and Celsius (°C) are identical, we set \( T_F = T_C \). Using the conversion formula \( T_F = \frac{9}{5}T_C + 32 \), substituting \( T_F = T_C \) gives:

\[
T_C = \frac{9}{5}T_C + 32
\]

Rearranging and solving:

\[
T_C - \frac{9}{5}T_C = 32 \quad \Rightarrow \quad -\frac{4}{5}T_C = 32 \quad \Rightarrow \quad T_C = -40
\]

Thus, \( T_F = T_C = -40 \). Converting to Rankine (°R) and Kelvin (°K):

\[
T_R = T_F + 459.67 = -40 + 459.67 = 419.67 \approx 420
\]
\[
T_K = T_C + 273.15 = -40 + 273.15 = 233.15 \approx 233.33
\]

### Part (b): Fahrenheit Reading is Twice the Celsius Reading
Here, \( T_F = 2T_C \). Using the conversion formula \( T_F = \frac{9}{5}T_C + 32 \), substitute \( T_F = 2T_C \):

\[
2T_C = \frac{9}{5}T_C + 32
\]

Rearranging and solving:

\[
2T_C - \frac{9}{5}T_C = 32 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{1}{5}T_C = 32 \quad \Rightarrow \quad T_C = 160
\]

Thus, \( T_F = 2T_C = 320 \). Converting to Rankine and Kelvin:

\[
T_R = T_F + 459.67 = 320 + 459.67 = 779.67 \approx 780
\]
\[
T_K = T_C + 273.15 = 160 + 273.15 = 433.15 \approx 433.33
\]

### Evaluating the Options
- **Option A**: Matches the calculations for both parts.
- **Option B**: Incorrect for part (a), as it states \( T = -30 \).
- **Option C**: Incorrect for part (b), as it states \( T_C = 170 \).
- **Option D**: Incorrect for part (a), as it states \( T_R = 400 \).

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**.
