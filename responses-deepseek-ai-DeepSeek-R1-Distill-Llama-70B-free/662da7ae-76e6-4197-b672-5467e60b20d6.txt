Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about the energy emitted by a tungsten filament in a light bulb. The question is asking me to calculate the percentage of energy emitted in the visible spectrum, which is between 0.4 micrometers and 0.7 micrometers. They mentioned treating it as a grey body, so I think that means we'll use the blackbody radiation equations but with an emissivity less than 1. But wait, I'm a bit confused because the problem doesn't give me the emissivity. Hmm, maybe I'm supposed to assume it's a perfect blackbody? Or perhaps the emissivity cancels out somehow in the calculations? I'll need to think about that.

First, I remember that the energy distribution of blackbody radiation is given by Planck's law. The total power emitted by a blackbody is calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is P = σ * A * ε * T^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, A is the surface area, ε is emissivity, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. But wait, the temperature given here is in Rankine. Oh right, I need to convert that to Kelvin because all the physics formulas use absolute temperatures.

So, 6000 degrees Rankine. I remember that to convert Rankine to Kelvin, you subtract 459.67 and then divide by 5/9. Wait, no, wait. The conversion between Kelvin and Rankine is that they are both absolute scales, so 0 K is equal to 0 R, and the size of a degree is the same. So wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, Kelvin and Rankine have a 1:1 scale but different zero points. Oh wait, no, actually, Kelvin is Celsius + 273.15, and Rankine is Fahrenheit + 459.67. So to convert from Rankine to Kelvin, I think you subtract 459.67 and then multiply by 5/9. Because Rankine is like Fahrenheit's absolute version, so each degree Rankine is 5/9 Kelvin.

So T = 6000 R. To get Kelvin, it's (6000 - 459.67) * 5/9. Let me calculate that: 6000 - 459.67 is 5540.33. Multiply by 5/9: 5540.33 * 5 = 27701.65, divided by 9 gives approximately 3078.85 K. Wait, but wait, let me double-check that. Oh wait, no, because 1 Rankine is 5/9 Kelvin. So 6000 R is 6000 * (5/9) K? Or is it the other way around when converting from R to K. Wait, no, to convert from Rankine to Kelvin, the formula is K = (R − 459.67) × 5/9. So yeah, as I did before. So 5540.33 *5/9 ≈ 5540.33 * 0.555555... Let's see: 5000 *0.5555 is 2777.77, 540.33 *0.5555 is about 300. So total is approximately 3077.77 K. Let's just call it approximately 3078 K for simplicity.

Now, the next step is to calculate the energy emitted in the visible range. Since the bulb is considered a grey body, I think we can use the blackbody spectrum and then apply the emissivity, but since the question is about the percentage of energy emitted in the visible range relative to the total, the emissivity would cancel out. Because when calculating the ratio, ε cancels in numerator and denominator. So maybe I can just use blackbody equations.

The energy emitted per unit wavelength (u) is given by Planck's law:

Bλ(T) = (2 h c²) / (λ^5) * 1/(e^{hc/(λ k T)} - 1)

But integrating this over a range of wavelengths isn't straightforward. Instead, I think I should use the fraction of power emitted in a certain wavelength range. I remember that the total power is σ T^4, and the fractional power in a range can be found using the radiative flux per wavelength divided by the total flux.

Alternatively, I remember that there's something called the Wien's displacement law, which tells me the peak wavelength. But that's probably not directly helpful here. Instead, I should probably compute the integral of the Planck function from 0.4 to 0.7 micrometers, then divide by the total integral over all wavelengths to find the percentage.

But wait, integrating Planck's law is complicated because it involves an integral that doesn't have an elementary antiderivative. However, I remember that there's an approximate method or perhaps a table of values for the fractional emissive power of a blackbody within certain wavelength ranges. Alternatively, I think the problem might be using an approximation where we can calculate the fraction of the total energy emitted in the visible range using the blackbody formula.

Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to use the formula for the energy density in terms of wavelength and integrate it from 0.4 to 0.7 micrometers, then divide by the total energy density, which is the Stefan-Boltzmann law.

Wait, another approach: the fractional emissive power P between λ1 and λ2 is P = ( π^4 * (k T)^4 )/(2 h^3 c^2) ) * [ F(λ2 T) - F(λ1 T) ], where F is a function involving integrals of the Planck distribution. But I'm not sure about the exact form. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Wien's law approximation or the Rayleigh-Jeans law, but those are approximations and only valid in certain regimes.

Alternatively, I might remember that the fraction can be determined using the formula involving the integral of x^3/(e^x -1) dx from x1 to x2, where x = h c/(λ k T). Wait, that sounds right.

So the Planck function per unit wavelength is proportional to λ^-5 / (e^{h c/(λ k T)} - 1). If I make a substitution x = h c/(λ k T), then λ = h c/(x k T), so dλ = -(h c/(x^2 k T)) dx. Then, the integral over λ becomes an integral over x.

So the energy per unit wavelength is:

u = (8 π h c)/(λ^5) * 1/(e^{h c/(λ k T)} - 1) )

But the total energy emitted per unit area per unit time (the flux) is the integral of u over all λ, which is σ T^4 / π (the Stefan-Boltzmann law divided by pi because u is per unit area per steradian, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that). Hmm, perhaps better to think in terms of the total emissive power, P_total = σ ε A T^4, but again, since we're taking a ratio, the ε and A will cancel. So perhaps I can compute the integral from λ1 to λ2 of u(λ) dλ, and then divide by the integral from 0 to infinity of u(λ) dλ, which is σ T^4.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck on the exact expressions. Let me think again. The fractional power emitted between λ1 and λ2 is the integral from λ1 to λ2 of u(λ) dλ, divided by the integral from 0 to infinity of u(λ) dλ.

So, F = [∫ (from λ1 to λ2) u(λ) dλ ] / [∫ (0 to ∞) u(λ) dλ ]

And since u(λ) is (2 h c^2)/(λ^5) * 1/(e^{h c/(λ k T)} - 1), then:

F = [∫ (λ1 to λ2) (2 h c^2)/(λ^5) * 1/(e^{h c/(λ k T)} - 1) dλ ] / [∫ (0 to ∞) same ]

But I can factor out constants. Let me define x1 = h c/(λ1 k T) and x2 = h c/(λ2 k T). Then, substituting λ = h c/(x k T), so dλ = - (h c)/(x^2 k T) dx.

Let me change variables for the integral. So:

∫ (λ=λ1 to λ=λ2) [2 h c^2/(λ^5)] * 1/(e^{h c/(λ k T)} - 1) dλ

= 2 h c^2 ∫ (x=x1 to x=x2) [1/( (h c/(x k T))^5 ) ] * 1/(e^x - 1) * (- (h c)/(x^2 k T)) dx )

Wait, but the limits would switch because as λ increases, x decreases. So when λ = λ1 (smaller), x is larger, and when λ = λ2 (larger), x is smaller. So the integral becomes from x2 to x1, but with a negative sign, which swaps the limits back to x1 to x2.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute each substitution:

λ = h c/(x k T) → dλ = - (h c)/(x^2 k T) dx

So, substituting into the integral:

∫ [2 h c^2 / (λ^5) ] * [1/(e^{x} - 1)] dλ

= 2 h c^2 ∫ [1/( (h c/(x k T))^5 ) ] * [1/(e^x - 1)] * [ (h c)/(x^2 k T) ) dx ]

Wait, but the dλ is negative, so when I change the limits, the negative sign will flip the integration bounds.

Wait, maybe it's easier to proceed without worrying about the sign and just adjust the limits accordingly.

Let me compute the substitution:

Let me write this as:

= 2 h c^2 ∫ [ (x k T / h c )^5 ] * [1/(e^x -1)] * [ (h c) / (x^2 k T) ) dx ]

Simplify each part:

(x k T / h c )^5 → x^5 (k T)^5 / (h c)^5

Multiply by (h c)/(x^2 k T) → (h c) / (x^2 k T)

So overall, the terms inside the integral become:

[ x^5 (k T)^5 / (h c)^5 ) ] * [ (h c) / (x^2 k T) ) ] = x^3 (k T)^4 / (h c)^4 )

So the integral becomes:

2 h c^2 * ∫ [ x^3 (k T)^4 / (h c)^4 ) ] * [1/(e^x -1) ] dx

Simplify the constants:

2 h c^2 * (k T)^4 / (h c)^4 ) = 2 h c^2 * (k^4 T^4) ) / (h^4 c^4 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

h^4 c^4 in denominator. So,

2 * h c^2 * k^4 T^4 ) / (h^4 c^4 ) ) = 2 k^4 T^4 / (h^3 c^2 )

So the integral becomes:

(2 k^4 T^4 )/(h^3 c^2 ) ∫ [ x^3 / (e^x -1) ] dx from x1 to x2.

Now, the integral of x^3/(e^x -1) dx from x1 to x2 is a known function, but it doesn't have an elementary form. However, I remember that the definite integral from 0 to infinity of x^3/(e^x -1) dx is equal to π^4 /15. So the total integral for F would be:

F = [ (2 k^4 T^4 )/(h^3 c^2 ) ∫_{x1}^{x2} x^3/(e^x -1) dx ) ] / [ (2 k^4 T^4 )/(h^3 c^2 ) ∫_0^∞ x^3/(e^x -1) dx ) ]

Wait, but the denominator is the total power, which is σ T^4. Hmm, because the total power per unit area is σ T^4. Let me check:

σ = (2 h c^2 k^4 π^4 )/(15 h^3 c^2 ) ) Wait, wait, let me think. The Stefan-Boltzmann constant σ is (2 π^4 k^4 )/(15 h^3 c^2 )). So indeed, the denominator would be σ T^4.

But in the expression for F, the (2 k^4 T^4 )/(h^3 c^2 ) terms in numerator and denominator would cancel, so F becomes:

[ ∫_{x1}^{x2} x^3/(e^x -1) dx ] / [ ∫_0^∞ x^3/(e^x -1) dx ] ) 

And the denominator integral is π^4 /15, so F = [ ∫_{x1}^{x2} x^3/(e^x -1) dx ] / (π^4 /15 )

Alternatively, F = 15/(π^4) * ∫_{x1}^{x2} x^3/(e^x -1) dx

So, I can compute F as 15/π^4 times the integral from x1 to x2 of x^3/(e^x -1) dx.

So the problem now reduces to calculating this integral between x1 and x2 where x = h c/(λ k T), for λ1=0.4 μm and λ2=0.7 μm.

Let me compute x1 and x2.

First, compute constants:

h = Planck's constant = 6.62607015e-34 J·s
c = speed of light = 3e8 m/s
k = Boltzmann constant = 1.380649e-23 J/K

T is approximately 3078 K.

So, λ1 = 0.4 μm = 0.4e-6 m
λ2 = 0.7e-6 m

Compute x1 = h c/(λ1 k T)
x1 = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (0.4e-6 * 1.38e-23 * 3078)

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25

Denominator: 0.4e-6 *1.38e-23 *3078 ≈ 0.4e-6 *1.38e-23 ≈ 5.52e-29; 5.52e-29 * 3078 ≈ 1.7e-25.

So x1 ≈ 1.9878e-25 / 1.7e-25 ≈ approx 1.168.

Similarly, x2 = h c/(λ2 k T) = same numerator, denominator with λ2=0.7e-6.

Denominator: 0.7e-6 *1.38e-23 *3078 ≈ 0.7e-6 *1.38e-23 ≈ 9.66e-29; 9.66e-29 *3078 ≈ 2.97e-25.

x2 = 1.9878e-25 / 2.97e-25 ≈ approx 0.669.

So x1 ≈ 1.168, x2 ≈ 0.669.

So the integral is from x=0.669 to x=1.168 of x^3/(e^x -1) dx.

I need to compute this integral. Since I don't have an exact analytical solution, I might need to use a table or approximate it numerically. Alternatively, I can remember that this function is related to the Riemann zeta function, but perhaps for the purpose of this problem, I can use approximate values or a series expansion.

Wait, but I think that in practice, for such problems, you either use a table of values for the integral of x^3/(e^x -1) between certain limits or approximate it using numerical integration methods.

Alternatively, I can use the fact that the integral from a to b of x^3/(e^x -1) dx can be approximated by summing over small intervals, using methods like the trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule.

But without doing actual integration, perhaps there's a smarter way. I remember that for these types of problems, sometimes the visibility of the wavelength range can be looked up, or perhaps using the fact that the visible spectrum corresponds to certain x ranges.

Alternatively, I can use the fact that the integral of x^3/(e^x -1) dx from 0 to ∞ is π^4/15 ≈ 6.4939.

But I need the definite integral from 0.669 to 1.168. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can use a calculator or an online integral calculator to approximate this. But since I'm doing this manually, I might need to make an approximation.

Let me think: The function x^3/(e^x -1) is highest near x=1, and decreases on either side. So between x=0.669 and 1.168, the function will have a peak somewhere in between.

Alternatively, I can use series expansion. The integral of x^3/(e^x -1) dx can be expressed as the sum over n=1 to infinity of x^3 e^{-n x}/(1 - e^{-x}) ), but that might not help much. Alternatively, note that 1/(e^x -1) = e^{-x} + e^{-2x} + e^{-3x} + ..., so the integral becomes sum_{n=1}^\infty ∫ x^3 e^{-n x} dx from 0.669 to 1.168.

But integrating term by term:

∫ x^3 e^{-n x} dx = e^{-n x} [ (x^3)(-1/(n)) + 3 x^2 (1/n^2) - 6 x (1/n^3) + 6 (1/n^4) ) ] + C

But this would require evaluating each term from 0.669 to 1.168, which is tedious.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a table of the function F(x) = ∫_0^x (t^3)/(e^t -1) dt. Then
