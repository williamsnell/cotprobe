Okay, so I've got this question about lateral communication in an organization. Hmm, I need to figure out what lateral communication means. Let me think. I remember that organizational communication can flow in different directions: downward, upward, and lateral. 

Downward communication is when information flows from the top management to the lower levels, like when bosses tell employees what to do. Upward is the opposite, where employees communicate to their managers or higher-ups, like feedback or reports.

But what about lateral? I think it's when information is shared between people on the same level. Like, between different departments or teams that are at the same hierarchical level. Oh right, so it's not going up or down, but sideways. That helps with coordination between different functions or departments.

Looking at the options, option J says "Information passes between different departments and functions." That sounds right because lateral communication is about sharing info across departments, not up or down.

Wait, let me check other options to make sure. Option A is about official meetings only, which might not necessarily be lateral. B restricts info within a single department, which is the opposite. C is external stakeholders, so that's outside the organization. D is only through the head, which is more like downward or upward. E is public announcements, which is probably downward. F is upwards only, G is downwards. H is two-way, but that could be any direction. I is diagonal, which might involve different levels, so that's different from lateral. 

So the correct answer should be J.

The correct answer is J. Lateral communication occurs when information is shared between different departments and functions at the same hierarchical level, facilitating coordination without involving the higher-ups.

Answer: J
