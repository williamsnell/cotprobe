Question:

A newborn infant is examined by a doctor, who determines that the child has syphilis. Explain how the child con-tracted syphilis .

Options:

A: The baby contracted it from a contaminated surface.
B: The baby acquired the infection through kissing or close contact with an infected person.
C: The infant contracted the disease from another infant.
D: The child inherited the disease as an autosomal recessive trait from the parents.
E: The child contracted the disease from a blood transfusion shortly after birth.
F: The infant was vaccinated with a contaminated needle.
G: An infected mother can transmit the organism by placental transfer to the fetus during the first four months of pregnancy or as the fetus passes through the infected vagina during birth.
H: The infant developed the disease due to exposure to the bacterium in the hospital environment after birth.
I: The baby contracted it through breastfeeding from an infected mother.
J: The baby was born with it due to a genetic mutation.

Okay, so I've got this question about a newborn with syphilis, and I need to figure out how the baby got it. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. But wait, how does that apply to a newborn? I mean, babies can't get STIs through sexual contact, right? So it must be another way.

I think congenital syphilis is when the baby gets it from the mother. But how exactly does that happen? I recall that during pregnancy, certain infections can pass from mother to fetus. So maybe the mother had syphilis and passed it on.

Looking at the options, option G says the mother can transmit it via placental transfer during the first four months or during birth through the vagina. That makes sense because the placenta is the connection between mother and fetus. So if the mother is infected, the bacteria could cross the placenta.

Other options don't seem right. Option A suggests contaminated surfaces, but syphilis isn't really spread that way. It's more through direct contact with sores. Option B is kissing or close contactâ€”probably not the main way a newborn gets it. They wouldn't have been kissing anyone yet.

Option C is from another infant, which seems unlikely at birth. D says it's inherited autosomal recessive, but syphilis is an infection, not a genetic disease. So D is out.

E is blood transfusion, but that's rare, especially right after birth. F talks about a contaminated needle for vaccination, which I guess is possible, but not the most common way a newborn would get it.

H is hospital exposure after birth. Maybe, but the question says the doctor determined the child has it, implying it's from birth, not after. I is through breastfeeding. I'm not sure if syphilis can be transmitted that way. I think the main risk is during pregnancy.

J is genetic mutation, which doesn't fit because it's a bacterial infection, not genetic.

So putting it all together, the most likely answer is G. The mother passed it via the placenta or during delivery.

The correct answer is G. Syphilis in a newborn is typically caused by congenital transmission, where the infected mother passes the bacterium Treponema pallidum to the fetus via the placenta during pregnancy or through the vagina during childbirth.
