Question:

A shop owner domiciled in State A sued a distributor in a federal district court in State A for breach of a contract. The shop owner sought $100,000 in damages for allegedly defective goods that the distributor had provided under the contract. The distributor is incorporated in State B, with its principal place of business in State C. The distributor brought in as a third-party defendant the wholesaler that had provided the goods to the distributor, alleging that the wholesaler had a duty to indemnify the distributor for any damages recovered by the shop owner. The wholesaler is incorporated in State B, with its principal place of business in State A. The wholesaler has asserted a $60,000 counterclaim against the distributor for payment for the goods at issue, and the distributor has moved to dismiss the counterclaim for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Should the motion to dismiss be granted?

Options:

A: No, because the distributor and the wholesaler conduct business in different states.
B: Yes, because there is no diversity of citizenship between the distributor and the wholesaler.
C: Yes, because the wholesaler's counterclaim is not directly related to the distributor's claim.
D: No, because the wholesaler's and the distributor's principal places of business are diverse.
E: No, because the distributor has invoked the jurisdiction of the court.
F: Yes, because the amount in controversy does not meet the jurisdictional limit.
G: Yes, because the wholesaler's counterclaim is not a compulsory counterclaim.
H: No, because the wholesaler and distributor are incorporated in the same state.
I: No, because there is supplemental jurisdiction over the wholesaler's counterclaim.
J: Yes, because there is no diversity of citizenship between the shop owner and the wholesaler.

Okay, so I've got this question about federal jurisdiction, specifically dealing with diversity and supplemental jurisdiction. Let me try to unpack it step by step.

First, the setup: A shop owner in State A sued a distributor in federal court in State A for breach of contract, seeking $100k. The distributor is incorporated in State B, principal place of business in State C. Then, the distributor brings in a third-party defendant, the wholesaler, claiming the wholesaler should indemnify them for any damages the shop owner gets. The wholesaler is incorporated in State B but has its principal place in State A. Now, the wholesaler has a $60k counterclaim against the distributor for payment of the goods. The distributor moves to dismiss this counterclaim for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. The question is whether the motion should be granted.

So, the main issue here is whether the federal court has jurisdiction over the wholesaler's counterclaim. The options suggest it's about diversity jurisdiction, supplemental jurisdiction, and other related concepts.

I remember that for a federal court to have jurisdiction under diversity, the parties must be citizens of different states, and the amount in controversy must exceed $75,000. But wait, the wholesaler's counterclaim is only $60k, which is below that threshold. Hmm, that could be a problem.

Wait, but there's also the idea of supplemental jurisdiction. Under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1367, when a court has original jurisdiction over a claim, it can exercise supplemental jurisdiction over other claims that are part of the same case or controversy, as long as they aren't frivolous or unrelated. But there's an exception when the original claim is based on diversity. If the state law claims would otherwise require diversity, and the court would drop them if the original claim is dismissed. Also, if the counterclaim is not supported by diversity, but the court can still hear it under supplemental jurisdiction only if it's part of the same case or controversy.

Wait, but the initial claim is the shop owner suing the distributor. The distributor's third-party claim against the wholesaler is probably within the same transaction or occurrence, so that's why it's brought in. But when the wholesaler brings a counterclaim against the distributor, is that considered part of the same case or controversy?

Wait, the wholesaler's counterclaim is for payment for the goods. So, the main issue is whether the court has jurisdiction over this counterclaim.

Let me think about the parties involved. The shop owner is from State A. The distributor is incorporated in B, principal place in C. The wholesaler is incorporated in B, principal place in A.

So, the main suit is based on diversity between the shop owner (A) and the distributor (B and C). Since the distributor is a corporation, its citizenship is in State B (where incorporated) and State C (principal place). So, the shop owner is in A, and the distributor is in B and C. So, diversity exists because A is different from B and C. The amount is over $75k, so diversity jurisdiction is proper.

Now, the third-party claim: the distributor sues the wholesaler. The wholesaler is in State B (incorporated) and A (principal place). So, the wholesaler's citizenship is B and A. The distributor is B and C. So, between the distributor and wholesaler, the distributor is citizen of B and C, wholesaler is B and A. So, there's no diversity between them because both are citizens of B. So, diversity jurisdiction doesn't exist between distributor and wholesaler.

But wait, the main case is already in federal court under diversity. So, the third-party claim is part of the same case. The court can exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the third-party claim as it's part of the same controversy.

But what about the wholesaler's counterclaim against the distributor? The counterclaim is by the wholesaler against the distributor for $60k. The issue is whether the court can hear that.

So, the counterclaim is a separate claim, but it's part of the same lawsuit. The court has original jurisdiction over the main claim (shop owner v. distributor) based on diversity. So, under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1367(a), the court can exercise supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are part of the same case or controversy.

But there's a catch. If the court's original jurisdiction is based solely on diversity, then for any state law claims that are not within the court's diversity jurisdiction, the court can only exercise supplemental jurisdiction if they are so related. However, if the counterclaim would require diversity jurisdiction, but the parties aren't diverse, then the court can't exercise jurisdiction over it unless it's under supplemental.

Wait, but the counterclaim is for $60k, which is below the $75k requirement. So even if diversity existed, the amount wouldn't meet the threshold. But the court can still hear it under supplemental jurisdiction because it's part of the same case.

Wait, but to apply supplemental jurisdiction, the court must have original jurisdiction. The main claim is properly before the court under diversity. The third-party claim (distributor v. wholesaler) may not meet diversity, but the court can take it under supplemental. Similarly, the counterclaim is part of the same case, so it's covered.

Alternatively, if the counterclaim is compulsory, then it's part of the same controversy, and the court can exercise jurisdiction. But even if it's not compulsory, if it's related, the court can still hear it.

Wait, but the problem is the amount in controversy. The main claim is over $75k, so the court's jurisdiction is based on that. The counterclaim is $60k, which on its own wouldn't meet the diversity requirement. However, under supplemental jurisdiction, the court can hear it if it's part of the same case.

So, the wholesaler's counterclaim is for $60k. Since the main claim is already in federal court, the counterclaim is part of that case. So the court can exercise supplemental jurisdiction over it, regardless of whether the amount is below $75k.

Wait, but 28 U.S.C. ยง 1367(b) says that the court shall not exercise supplemental jurisdiction over claims where the jurisdiction would be based on diversity if the matter is so related that they form part of the same case or controversy, but the court can if the claim raises a federal question. Wait, no, the exception is when the original claim is based on diversity and the state law claim would undermine diversity jurisdiction. So, if the original claim is diversity, the court may decline supplemental jurisdiction if the state law claim would require diversity and the parties aren't diverse. But in this case, the counterclaim is not between the original plaintiff and the third-party defendant, but between the third-party plaintiff (distributor) and the third-party defendant (wholesaler).

Wait, no, the counterclaim is the wholesaler's claim against the distributor. So, the parties are the distributor and the wholesaler. As I thought earlier, their citizenship is in B and A for the wholesaler, and B and C for the distributor. So, they share B as a state of citizenship, meaning no diversity between them. So, the court can't exercise diversity jurisdiction over their claims. But since the main claim is in federal court, and the counterclaim arises from the same transaction (the contract and the goods), the court can exercise supplemental jurisdiction.

So, the motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction should be denied because the court has supplemental jurisdiction over the counterclaim.

Looking at the options:

Option I says: No, because there is supplemental jurisdiction over the wholesaler's counterclaim.

So, the motion should not be granted, meaning the answer is I.

Wait, let me check other options. Option H is No because they are incorporated in same state. No, because the wholesaler is in B and A, and the distributor is in B and C. So their citizenship overlaps in B, so no diversity.

Option B says Yes because no diversity between distributor and wholesaler. But the court can still have jurisdiction under supplemental, so B is incorrect.

Option F says Yes because the amount is below limit. But that's only if the court's jurisdiction is based solely on diversity. Since it's based on the main claim's diversity, the counterclaim can be heard through supplemental, regardless of the amount.

So, the correct answer is I.

The question revolves around whether the federal court has subject-matter jurisdiction over the wholesaler's $60,000 counterclaim against the distributor. The main lawsuit is based on diversity jurisdiction, as the shop owner (citizen of State A) sued the distributor (citizen of State B and State C), and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. The distributor, as a third-party plaintiff, brought in the wholesaler (citizen of State B and State A) as a third-party defendant, and the wholesaler asserted a counterclaim against the distributor for $60,000.

Key points of analysis:

1. **Diversity Jurisdiction**: For diversity jurisdiction, the parties must be citizens of different states, and the amount in controversy must exceed $75,000. Here, the distributor and the wholesaler share citizenship in State B, so there is no diversity between them. Additionally, the wholesaler's counterclaim is for $60,000, which is below the jurisdictional threshold for diversity jurisdiction.

2. **Supplemental Jurisdiction**: Under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1367(a), a federal court with original jurisdiction over a claim can exercise supplemental jurisdiction over other claims that are part of the same case or controversy. The main claim (shop owner v. distributor) is properly before the court under diversity jurisdiction. The wholesaler's counterclaim arises from the same transaction (the contract and the goods) and is therefore part of the same case or controversy. Thus, the court can exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the counterclaim, even though it does not independently satisfy the diversity requirements.

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The fact that the distributor and wholesaler conduct business in different states is irrelevant to the jurisdictional analysis.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. While there is no diversity between the distributor and the wholesaler, the court can still exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the counterclaim.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The wholesaler's counterclaim is directly related to the distributor's claim and arises from the same transaction.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. The principal places of business are irrelevant to the diversity analysis between the distributor and the wholesaler, as both are citizens of State B.
   - **Option E**: Incorrect. The distributor's invocation of jurisdiction does not automatically confer jurisdiction over the counterclaim.
   - **Option F**: Incorrect. The amount in controversy is only relevant for diversity jurisdiction, not for supplemental jurisdiction.
   - **Option G**: Incorrect. The counterclaim is part of the same case or controversy and does not need to be a compulsory counterclaim to fall under supplemental jurisdiction.
   - **Option H**: Incorrect. The wholesaler and distributor are not incorporated in the same state; both are incorporated in State B, but the wholesaler also has its principal place of business in State A.
   - **Option I**: Correct. The court has supplemental jurisdiction over the wholesaler's counterclaim because it arises from the same transaction as the main claim.
   - **Option J**: Incorrect. The relationship between the shop owner and the wholesaler is irrelevant to the jurisdictional analysis between the distributor and the wholesaler.

The motion to dismiss should not be granted because the court has supplemental jurisdiction over the wholesaler's counterclaim.
