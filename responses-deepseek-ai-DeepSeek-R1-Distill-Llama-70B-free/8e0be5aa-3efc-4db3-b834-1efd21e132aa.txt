Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the maximum kinetic energy of a beta-minus particle emitted when He-6 undergoes radioactive decay. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that in beta-minus decay, a neutron in the nucleus converts into a proton, an electron (beta particle), and an antineutrino. The general equation for beta decay is something like:

n → p + e⁻ + ν̄_e

But for the specific case of He-6 decaying, I guess the isotope must be changing. He-6 has 2 protons and 4 neutrons. So, when it undergoes beta decay, a neutron turns into a proton, so the new nucleus will have 3 protons and 3 neutrons. What element has 3 protons? Oh right, that's lithium. So He-6 (which is an isotope of helium with 6 nucleons) becomes Li-6.

So the decay equation would be:

He-6 → Li-6 + e⁻ + ν̄_e (plus any other particles, but I think that's the main ones).

Wait, but in terms of atomic number, He has Z=2, so after decay, Li has Z=3, which makes sense.

Now, to find the maximum kinetic energy of the beta particle, I need to look into the energy released in this decay. The maximum kinetic energy is the total energy released minus any energy carried away by other particles, but wait, in beta decay, the total energy comes from the mass difference between the parent and daughter atoms.

But how do I calculate that? I remember that the Q value of the decay gives the maximum kinetic energy of the beta particle. The Q value is the energy released, and it's calculated using the masses of the parent, daughter, and the emitted particles.

Wait, in beta decay, the Q value is given by the mass difference between the parent and the daughter, multiplied by c squared. So the formula is:

Q = [M_parent - M_daughter - m_e] * c²

But wait, I think I need to account for the masses properly. Let me think again.

The parent is He-6, which is a neutral atom. After decay, it becomes Li-6, which is also neutral, and emits an electron and an antineutrino. So the mass of the parent is M_He6, and the mass of the daughter is M_Li6. The electron is created in the decay, so its mass is included in the calculation.

Wait, no, maybe the correct formula includes the mass of the electron because in the decay, a neutron (mass m_n) converts into a proton (m_p), an electron (m_e), and an antineutrino (which has negligible mass). So the mass difference would be m_n - m_p - m_e, but on the atomic level, we have to consider the atomic masses.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this by using the atomic masses. The atomic mass of He-6 is M(He6), and after decay, it becomes Li-6 and an electron is emitted. So the Q value is the rest mass difference between the parent and the daughter, but considering that the daughter is an ion because it gains a proton.

Wait, no, the He-6 atom is neutral, so when it decays, the Li-6 will have a +1 charge because it's gained a proton. But the emitted electron brings the charge back to neutral for the system. So maybe the atomic masses should include the electrons around the nucleus.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the masses of the neutral atoms. So, the parent is He-6 (mass M_He6), and the daughter is Li-6 (mass M_Li6), and the emitted electron comes from the decay.

So the Q value would be:

Q = (M_He6 - M_Li6) * c²

Wait, but that might not include the electron mass. Because in the decay, a neutron turns into a proton, electron, and antineutrino. So the mass of the He-6 is the mass of the nucleus plus the electrons. Similarly for Li-6.

Wait, maybe I should use the atomic masses because electrons are included in the atomic mass. So He-6 has 2 electrons, and Li-6 has 3. So when He-6 decays into Li-6, the number of electrons increases by one. So perhaps in the decay, an electron is emitted, so the atomic mass of Li-6 would have one more proton and one more electron than He-6.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

Q = [M_Parent - (M_Daughter + m_e)] * c²

But I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should look up the general formula for beta decay Q value.

I recall that for beta-minus decay, the Q value is calculated as:

Q = (M_Parent - M_Daughter) * c²

But wait, I think that's when the parent and daughter are both considered as neutral atoms. Let me think about it. For example, if a nucleus X decays into Y plus an electron and antineutrino, the atomic masses include the electrons. So the parent has Z electrons, and the daughter has Z+1 electrons. So when the decay happens, the daughter (Y) would have Z+1 protons and thus in its neutral state, Z+1 electrons. The parent had Z electrons. So in the decay, an extra electron is emitted, so the mass M_Parent = mass of X nucleus + Z electrons.

M_Daughter = mass of Y nucleus + (Z+1) electrons.

Wait, but the Y nucleus has a charge of + (Z+1)e, so it would attract Z+1 electrons. So when considering the mass of Y as an atom, it's Y nucleus plus Z+1 electrons.

So the mass difference is M_Parent - M_Daughter = [X nucleus + Z e] - [Y nucleus + (Z+1) e] = (X nucleus - Y nucleus) - e.

But X nucleus is the parent, and Y is the daughter nucleus. So in terms of atomic masses, perhaps the formula becomes:

Q = [M_X_atom - M_Y_atom + m_e] * c²

Wait, let me think again. Let me write the decay equation clearly.

The parent atom is He-6, which has 2 protons and 4 neutrons, and 2 electrons. The daughter is Li-6, which has 3 protons, 3 neutrons, and 3 electrons. So the decay is:

He-6 → Li-6 + β⁻ + ν̄_e

But the Li-6 atom has 3 electrons, while He-6 had 2. So the emitted β⁻ is an additional electron. So the mass of He-6 includes 2 electrons, and the mass of Li-6 includes 3. Therefore, when He-6 decays, the mass lost is (He-6 mass) - (Li-6 mass) = (mass of He-6 nucleus + 2m_e) - (mass of Li-6 nucleus + 3m_e)

= (He-6 nucleus - Li-6 nucleus) - m_e

But the He-6 nucleus and Li-6 nucleus have different masses because He-6 has 2 protons and 4 neutrons, and Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look up the formula for calculating the Q value of beta decay. From what I remember, the Q value is given by:

Q = (M_parent - M_daughter - m_e) * c²

But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, it's the mass of the parent atom minus the mass of the daughter atom times c squared, because the emitted electron comes from the decay, so the daughter's mass includes one more proton and one more electron, while the parent had one less.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

Q = [M_Parent - M_Daughter] * c²

But because the daughter has an extra proton and one more electron, and the parent had the original configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

Q = (M_Parent - (M_Daughter - m_e)) ) * c²

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, I think the correct approach is to compute the mass difference between the parent and the daughter nuclei, considering that a neutron is converted into a proton, electron, and antineutrino.

The mass of a neutron is m_n = 939.565 MeV/c²

The mass of a proton is m_p = 938.272 MeV/c²

The mass of an electron is m_e = 0.511 MeV/c²

So, the mass difference for the decay is m_n - (m_p + m_e) = 939.565 - (938.272 + 0.511) = 939.565 - 938.783 = 0.782 MeV/c²

So that's the mass difference that's converted into energy. But wait, in the decay, the antineutrino carries away some energy, so the maximum kinetic energy of the beta particle would be when the antineutrino has negligible kinetic energy. Therefore, the maximum KE of the beta is equal to the Q value.

Wait, no, the Q value is the total energy available, which is the sum of the kinetic energies of the beta, the antineutrino, and any recoil of the daughter nucleus. But in the case of maximum beta energy, the antineutrino and daughter nucleus are at rest, so all the Q value goes into the beta's kinetic energy.

But wait, I'm confusing between the decay Q value and the actual energy released. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum kinetic energy of the beta is equal to the Q value, which is the mass difference as I calculated.

Wait, but the mass difference I calculated is 0.782 MeV/c². But looking at the options, the answers are around 2 MeV or higher. So maybe I'm doing something wrong here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the atomic masses instead of the nuclear masses because the beta decay involves the atomic masses.

So I need to find the atomic masses of He-6 and Li-6.

I remember that the atomic mass unit (u) is 931.5 MeV/c² per u.

The atomic mass of He-6 is approximately 6.018887 u.

The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.015122 u.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact values. Let me think. Helium-6 has 2 protons, 4 neutrons, and 2 electrons. Its atomic mass should be the sum of the protons, neutrons, and electrons. But no, atomic mass is the mass of the entire atom, including electrons.

Wait, perhaps I can look up the atomic masses. But since I can't actually look them up, I'll have to proceed with approximate values.

Alternatively, I can use the mass defect formula. The mass of He-6: Z=2, so 2 protons, 4 neutrons, and 2 electrons. Similarly, Li-6 has Z=3, so 3 protons, 3 neutrons, and 3 electrons.

So the mass of He-6 atom is: 2*(m_p + m_e) + 4*m_n - binding_energy_He6

Similarly, the mass of Li-6 atom is: 3*(m_p + m_e) + 3*m_n - binding_energy_Li6

Wait, but this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the atomic masses directly.

Assuming that the atomic mass of He-6 is M_He6 and Li-6 is M_Li6. Then the Q value would be:

Q = (M_He6 - M_Li6) * c²

But since He-6 decays into Li-6 plus an electron and an antineutrino, I think the correct equation is:

He-6 → Li-6 + β⁻ + ν̄_e

So the mass of He-6 is M_He6.

The mass of Li-6 plus the emitted electron is M_Li6 + m_e.

Wait, because Li-6 has one more proton and one more electron than He-6. So the mass of He-6 is equal to the mass of Li-6 plus an electron plus the mass difference that's converted into energy.

Wait, no, let me think again. The decay equation in atomic masses should be:

M_He6 = M_Li6 + m_e + (energy terms)

But energy terms include the kinetic energy of the beta and the antineutrino. The maximum kinetic energy of the beta is when the antineutrino's energy is zero. So the Q value is the mass difference between He-6 and (Li-6 + m_e), multiplied by c squared.

So Q = [M_He6 - (M_Li6 + m_e)] * c²

Wait, but that would mean that the Q value is the energy available. So if I can find the atomic masses of He-6 and Li-6, I can compute this.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the following approach:

The atomic mass of He-6 is approximately 6.018887 u.

The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.015122 u.

Wait, so M_He6 = 6.018887 u

M_Li6 = 6.015122 u

And m_e is 0.00054858 u (since 1 u = 931.5 MeV/c², and m_e c² is 0.511 MeV, so m_e = 0.511 / 931.5 ≈ 0.0005486 u)

So the mass difference is:

M_He6 - (M_Li6 + m_e) = 6.018887 - (6.015122 + 0.00054858) = 6.018887 - 6.01567058 = 0.00321642 u

Convert that to energy: 0.00321642 u * 931.5 MeV/u = ?

Let me compute that:

0.00321642 * 931.5 ≈ 

Let's see: 0.003 * 931.5 = 2.7945

0.00021642 * 931.5 ≈ 0.2015

Adding them gives approximately 2.7945 + 0.2015 ≈ 2.996 MeV

So Q ≈ 3.0 MeV

But wait, the options don't have exactly 3.0 MeV. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A:7.51

B:2.01

C:2.51

D:1.51

E:0.51

F:4.51

G:3.51

H:6.51

I:4.01

J:5.51

Hmm, I don't see a 3.0 MeV option. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the mass values.

Wait, I think the actual atomic mass of He-6 is about 6.018885 u.

Li-6 is about 6.015122 u.

So He-6 minus Li-6 is 6.018885 - 6.015122 = 0.003763 u.

Then adding m_e: 0.00054858 u.

Wait, wait, no. Because the formula is He-6 → Li-6 + e⁻ + ν̄_e.

So the mass of He-6 should equal the mass of Li-6 plus the mass of the emitted electron plus the energy (including rest mass of neutrino, but neutrino's mass is negligible, so we can ignore it).

Wait, perhaps the correct mass difference is M_He6 - M_Li6 = m_e + (Q)/c².

Wait no, the Q value is [M_He6 - (M_Li6 + m_e)] * c².

Wait, so the mass difference is M_He6 - M_Li6 - m_e.

Wait, no, He-6 has 2 electrons, Li-6 has 3. So when He-6 decays, it emits an electron. So the mass of He-6 is equal to the mass of Li-6 (which includes 3 electrons) plus the emitted electron? No, that can't be right because He-6 has 2 electrons, and Li-6 has 3. So when He-6 decays, it emits an electron, so the total electrons would be 3 (2 from He-6 and 1 emitted). But Li-6 as a neutral atom has 3 electrons, so that makes sense.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

M_He6 = M_Li6 + m_e + (energy terms)

So the energy terms would be the Q value: Q = (M_He6 - M_Li6 - m_e) * c²

So plugging in the numbers:

M_He6 = 6.018885 u

M_Li6 = 6.015122 u

m_e = 0.00054858 u

So M_He6 - M_Li6 - m_e = 6.018885 - 6.015122 - 0.00054858 = (6.018885 - 6.015122) = 0.003763 u; then subtract m_e: 0.003763 - 0.00054858 = 0.003214 u

Convert 0.003214 u to energy: 0.003214 * 931.5 MeV/u ≈ 

0.003 * 931.5 = 2.7945

0.000214 * 931.5 ≈ 0.1995

So total ≈ 2.7945 + 0.1995 = 2.994 MeV, approximately 3.0 MeV.

But the options don't have 3.0. The closest is option G:3.51 and option B:2.01, C:2.51.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass values. Let me check more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the actual Q value for He-6 beta decay.

Wait, I recall that He-6 undergoes beta decay to Li-6, and the Q value is about 3.5 MeV or so, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct calculation leads to around 3.5 MeV.

Wait, another approach: the beta decay Q value can be found using the atomic masses.

The formula is:

Q = (M_Parent - M_Daughter - m_e) * c²

So M_Parent is He-6's atomic mass, M_Daughter is Li-6's atomic mass.

Wait, but earlier when I tried that, I got about 3.0 MeV.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the nuclear masses instead. Because the
