Okay, so I have this economics question here about closing an expansionary gap. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my macroeconomics, but let me think through this.

First, I remember that an expansionary gap occurs when the economy is beyond its long-run potential, right? Like, when aggregate demand is higher than the long-run aggregate supply. So, in this situation, the economy is probably experiencing inflation because there's too much demand chasing limited resources.

Wait, the question is about how to close that gap. So the goal would be to bring the economy back to its long-run potential. How do we do that? I think it's about shifting the curves. The two main curves are aggregate demand (AD) and aggregate supply (AS), specifically the long-run AS which is vertical at the potential output level.

So, if we're in an expansionary gap, AD is to the right of LRAS. To close the gap, we need to reduce AD or increase AS. Because if AD shifts left, the excess demand goes away. Alternatively, if AS shifts right, the supply increases to meet the demand. But wait, shifting AS right would mean more productive capacity, but in the short run, AS might be more relevant. Or wait, noâ€”when we're talking about closing the gap, we're probably considering the short run adjustments.

Wait, no. The long-run AS is fixed based on resources, technology, etc. So in the long run, if AD is too high, the only way to close the gap is probably to reduce AD. Because AS can't shift in the long run; it's fixed. So, to close an expansionary gap, the government or central bank would implement policies to shift AD to the left.

What kind of policies would do that? Maybe contractionary fiscal policies, like reducing government spending or increasing taxes. Or monetary policies, like higher interest rates to reduce investment and consumption.

So looking at the options, the correct action would be to shift the aggregate demand curve to the left. Let's look at the options.

Option G says the aggregate demand curve should be shifted to the left. That makes sense. Option E says shift AS right and AD left, but I don't think shifting AS right is necessary because in the long run it doesn't move much. Also, shifting AS right in the short run might be possible, but if the economy is already at the long-run potential, increasing AS further isn't the solution. So probably shifting AD left is the way to go.

Other options: Option B is shifting AD right, which would make the gap worse. Option C is shifting AS left, which would also worsen the gap. Option G seems correct.

To close an expansionary gap, the economy needs to reduce the excess demand that exists when aggregate demand (AD) exceeds long-run aggregate supply (LRAS). This can be achieved by shifting the AD curve to the left. Policies such as contractionary fiscal measures (e.g., reducing government spending or increasing taxes) or contractionary monetary policies (e.g., raising interest rates to reduce investment and consumption) can accomplish this. Shifting the AD curve to the left reduces demand and aligns it with the economy's long-run potential, eliminating the inflationary pressures caused by the gap.

Option G, which suggests shifting the aggregate demand curve to the left, is the correct choice. Other options, such as shifting AD to the right (Option B) or shifting AS to the left (Option C), would exacerbate the gap. Shifting AS to the right (Option E or F) is not necessary because LRAS is fixed in the long run and does not shift in response to short-term demand changes.

Answer: G
