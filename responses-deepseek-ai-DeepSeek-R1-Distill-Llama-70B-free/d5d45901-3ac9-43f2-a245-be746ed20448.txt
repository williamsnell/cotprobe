Question:

After his 16th birthday, a youth decided to purchase a new sports car from a dealership for the sales price of $36,000. The youth thereafter entered into a written contract with the dealership, which provided that the youth would make monthly payments of $1,000 for three years. During the first year of the contract, the youth made 12 monthly payments totaling $12,000. However, the youth failed to make any payments during the second year of the contract. The dealership repeatedly threatened to sue the youth for the remaining balance that it claimed was due under the contract. Finally, in order to avoid litigation, the youth sent the dealership the following letter:"The car I purchased from you is a real lemon. I have spent a considerable sum of money during the last two years in repair work. I don't believe that the car is worth $36,000, but I am willing to pay you $10,000 if I find ajob in the next month. "The youth had just turned 18 when he sent this letter to the dealership. The day after mailing this letter, the youth was involved in an automobile accident, and the sports car was totally demolished. Following the accident, the youth remained unemployed, and he refused to make any payments to the dealership. At the time of the accident, the sports car was worth $18,000. In this jurisdiction, the age of majority is18 years of age. If the dealership brings suit against the youth for breach of contract, what, if any, is the plaintiff's proper recovery?

Options:

A: $36,000.00
B: $10,000. 00
C: $18,000. 00
D: The cost of repair work the youth has done on the car.
E: $30,000.00
F: Nothing.
G: $12,000.00
H: The cost of the car at the time of purchase minus the payments made so far.
I: $6,000.00

Okay, so I've got this contract law question to tackle, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

From what I understand, a youth bought a sports car when he was 16. The contract was for $36,000, with monthly payments of $1,000 over three years. So that's 36 payments totaling $36,000. He made 12 payments in the first year, totaling $12,000. Then he didn't pay anything in the second year, so he's in breach. The dealership is threatening to sue.

Now, the youth sent a letter offering $10,000 if he gets a job, but then he had an accident, the car was demolished, and he didn't pay. The question is about the dealership's proper recovery if they sue.

First, I need to think about contract law basics. A contract requires offer, acceptance, consideration. The youth was 16 when he entered the contract, so he's a minor. In most places, minors can disaffirm contracts, meaning they can choose to void the contract. But once a minor turns 18, they can ratify the contract either expressly or by implication.

Wait, but when did he turn 18 here? The letter was sent when he just turned 18. So after the contract was made, he became an adult and could ratify it. But did he do that?

The letter he sent said the car was a lemon and he'd pay $10k if he got a job. That might be an attempt to modify the contract or a new offer, but I'm not sure if that affects the original contract.

Also, after the letter, the car was demolished in an accident. The car was worth $18k at that time.

So, let's think about the possible claims.

The dealership is suing for breach of contract. So what's the measure of damages?

In a breach of contract case, the non-breaching party can recover damages equal to the contract price minus the amount already paid, adjusted for any mitigation.

But wait, the youth made 12 payments of $1k each, so $12k total. The contract was for $36k, so the remaining would be $24k. But since the car was destroyed, maybe the dealership can only recover the value of the car at the time of the accident, which was $18k, minus the payments made.

Wait, no, that might not be right. Because the car was destroyed, maybe the youth's obligation is to pay the remaining balance, but perhaps the dealership can't recover more than the actual loss.

Alternatively, the car's value might be relevant if the dealership can only recover the loss, which is the value of the car minus any payments received.

Wait, but the contract is for a sports car, so it's a goods contract under the UCC. When a buyer breaches, the seller can recover the contract price minus the market value at the time of breach, or they can recover the difference between the contract price and the market value.

Wait, no, let me think again. Under UCC Article 2, which governs sales of goods, when a buyer breaches, the seller can recover damages equal to the contract price minus the market price at the time and place for tender, plus any incidental damages, minus any payments made.

Wait, but in this case, the seller (dealership) is suing the buyer (youth) for non-payment. So the youth failed to pay the remaining $24k. But the car was destroyed in an accident after the breach occurred.

Hmm, but when the youth breached by not paying, the dealership could choose to cancel the contract and sue for damages. The measure would be the difference between the contract price and the market value of the goods at the time of breach, plus any incidental damages, minus any payments received.

Wait, but the youth had already taken possession of the car. So when he failed to pay, the dealership might have a claim for the unpaid balance, but perhaps subject to mitigation.

Alternatively, if the car was destroyed, maybe the dealership can't recover the full contract price because the car's value is lost. But I'm not sure about that. Let me think.

Wait, the contract was for the sale of the car. The youth took delivery, so the risk of loss would typically pass to the buyer once the contract is completed. So if the car was destroyed, the loss is on the buyer, unless the contract states otherwise.

So the dealership's claim would be for the unpaid balance under the contract, minus any payments made, but considering if the car's destruction affects this.

Wait, but the youth made 12 payments of $1k, so $12k. The contract is $36k, so $24k remains. But the car was worth $18k when it was destroyed. So perhaps the dealership can only recover the $18k minus the $12k already paid, which would be $6k.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the contract was for $36k. Alternatively, maybe the dealership can recover the full $24k because that's what's owed under the contract, regardless of the car's current value.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline the possible steps.

1. The youth entered into a contract as a minor. When he turned 18, he could ratify the contract. By making payments and using the car, he probably ratified it.

2. He breached the contract by not paying the second year's payments.

3. The dealership is suing for the unpaid balance.

4. The issue is whether the dealership can recover the full unpaid amount, or if the value of the car affects this.

Wait, but when the buyer breaches by non-payment, the seller can sue for the price. Under UCC ยง2-709(1), the seller can recover the price of the goods, minus any payments made, plus incidental damages, minus the market price if the seller could mitigate by selling the goods elsewhere.

But in this case, the car was destroyed, so the market value at the time of breach was $18k. So the dealership's damages would be the contract price ($36k) minus the payments made ($12k) minus the market value at the time of breach ($18k). So 36k -12k -18k = 6k. So the dealership can recover $6k.

Wait, but that's if they choose to sue under that section. Alternatively, they might have other options, but I think that's the main one.

Looking at the options, option I is $6,000. So that might be the answer.

But wait, what about the letter the youth sent? He offered $10k if he found a job. Does that affect the contract? Maybe it's a new offer, but the dealership didn't accept it. So it might not impact the original contract.

Also, the youth was 18 when he sent the letter, so the original contract was already ratified. So the letter doesn't change the terms unless both parties agree.

So putting it all together, the dealership can recover $6k, which is option I.

The youth purchased a sports car for $36,000 when he was 16, making it a minor's contract. Minors can disaffirm contracts, but upon turning 18, they can ratify the contract either expressly or by implication. Here, the youth ratified the contract by making 12 monthly payments of $1,000, totaling $12,000, and using the car. When he failed to make payments in the second year, he breached the contract.

The dealership is suing for breach of contract. Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) ยง2-709(1), the seller can recover damages equal to the contract price minus any payments made, plus incidental damages, minus the market value of the goods at the time of breach. At the time of the breach, the car was worth $18,000. The youth had already paid $12,000, leaving a remaining balance of $24,000. The dealership's recovery would be the contract price ($36,000) minus payments made ($12,000) minus the market value of the car at the time of breach ($18,000), resulting in $6,000.

The letter the youth sent offering $10,000 does not affect the original contract since it was not accepted by the dealership. The destruction of the car in an accident does not alter the dealership's right to recover damages for the breach of contract. Therefore, the dealership can properly recover $6,000.
