Question:

How would Maslow differentiate between an individual who was motivated by lower needs and one who was motivated by self-actualization needs ?

Options:

A: Lower needs motivated people are externally driven, while self-actualizing people are internally driven
B: Those motivated by lower needs often experience anxiety and stress when their needs are not met, while individuals focused on self-actualization maintain a sense of peace and contentment regardless of circumstances.
C: People motivated by lower needs are self-centered and focused on satisfying their own needs, while those motivated by self-actualization are growth-oriented and concerned with the nature of the world and other people.
D: Individuals motivated by lower needs require external validation, whereas those motivated by self-actualization needs find satisfaction from within themselves regardless of external recognition.
E: People motivated by lower needs are always in a state of deficiency, while those motivated by self-actualization are always in a state of abundance
F: Individuals motivated by lower needs are more likely to conform to societal expectations, while those pursuing self-actualization needs are more likely to challenge norms and pursue unconventional paths.
G: Lower needs motivated individuals prioritize social status and material wealth, whereas those motivated by self-actualization prioritize personal growth and meaningful experiences.
H: People motivated by lower needs are more likely to be individualistic, while those motivated by self-actualization are more likely to be communal
I: People driven by lower needs seek to maintain their basic comfort and security, while those driven by self-actualization seek to fulfill their potential and purpose in life.
J: People motivated by lower needs are primarily concerned with avoiding pain and discomfort, while those motivated by self-actualization embrace challenges and discomfort as opportunities for growth.

Okay, so I've got this question about Maslow's hierarchy of needs. I remember that Maslow proposed different levels of needs, starting from the most basic like physiological needs up to self-actualization. The question is asking how Maslow would differentiate between someone motivated by lower needs versus someone motivated by self-actualization.

Let me think about what each term means. Lower needs are the basic ones: physiological (like food, water), safety (security, protection), love and belongingness, and esteem. These are the foundational levels that must be met before higher needs can be addressed. Self-actualization is the highest level, where people seek to realize their full potential, pursue personal growth, and find purpose.

So the question is about the motivation sources. Lower needs are probably more about external factors or deficits. Like, if you're hungry, you're motivated by that lack, right? Whereas self-actualization is more internal, about fulfilling one's potential.

Looking at the options:

Option A says lower needs are externally driven, self-actualization is internally driven. That makes sense because lower needs are about external factors like getting food or safety, which come from outside. Self-actualization is about internal desires and personal growth.

Option B talks about anxiety when lower needs aren't met and peace otherwise. I think lower needs being unmet would cause anxiety, but self-actualization people might still feel peace. But I'm not sure if that's Maslow's main point.

Option C: Lower needs people are self-centered, self-actualizing are growth-oriented. Maybe, but lower needs could be about survival, not necessarily being self-centered. It's possible, but not sure.

Option D: External vs internal validation. I think lower needs might require external things, but self-actualization is internal satisfaction. So D could be right too.

Option F: Lower needs lead to conforming, self-actualization challenges norms. That sounds plausible because self-actualizers might be more independent.

Option I: Lower needs about basic comfort, self-actualization about fulfilling potential. That directly relates to the hierarchy, so I is a strong candidate.

Option J: Lower needs avoid pain, self-actualization embraces challenges. That aligns with deficit vs growth motivations.

So, the question is about differentiation in motivation source. I think A, D, F, I, J are all possible. But the key is what Maslow specifically said.

Wait, Maslow talked about lower needs as deficit needs. When they're not met, people feel anxious or tense. Self-actualization is about growth, so it's about internal drive. So when lower needs are unmet, people are motivated to resolve the deficit, which is external.

So A says lower needs are external, self-actualization internal. That seems correct.

But wait, option I says lower needs are about basic comfort, self-actualization about potential. That's also accurate but perhaps more about the content than the source of motivation.

The question is about how they are motivated. So the source is whether it's external or internal.

So A is about being driven by external factors (like needing food, which is outside) versus internal drives (like personal growth).

Alternatively, J says lower needs avoid pain, while self-actualization seeks growth through challenges. That also makes sense because lower needs are about avoiding discomfort (deficit), while higher needs are about embracing challenges.

Hmm. So both A and J seem relevant.

I think the key differentiation Maslow made was between deficiency motivation (lower) and growth motivation (self-actualization). Deficiency is about avoiding lack, growth about pursuing potential.

So J's description aligns with that: lower needs are about avoiding pain, self-actualization about growth through discomfort.

But wait, the question is about the source of motivation. So perhaps A is about the source being external vs internal.

I'm a bit torn. Let me think again.

Maslow's hierarchy: the lower needs (deficiency) are about external factors. Once those are met, people move to internal growth. So the motivation shifts from external (to get what's lacking) to internal (to grow).

So option A says lower needs are externally driven, self-actualization internally. That fits.

So the answer should be A. Or is it I?

Wait, option I says lower needs are about basic comfort, self-actualization about fulfilling potential. That's more about what the needs are, not the source.

So the differentiation is in the source of the motivation. So A is correct.

Wait, but I've also heard that self-actualization is about internal satisfaction, so D might also be a contender. D says lower needs require external validation, while self-actualization finds satisfaction within.

That's another angle. But the question is about the motivation, not the source of satisfaction.

Alternatively, F talks about societal expectations. Lower needs make people conform, self-actualization makes them challenge norms.

I think the main point is whether the motivation is from external (lower) or internal (self-actualization). So A is the best fit.
</think>

Maslow's hierarchy of needs differentiates between lower (deficiency) needs and self-actualization (growth) needs. Lower needs, such as physiological, safety, love, and esteem, are externally driven, as they arise from external factors like the need for food, security, or social approval. In contrast, self-actualization is internally driven, focusing on personal growth, realizing potential, and pursuing purpose. This distinction highlights that lower needs are motivated by external deficits, while self-actualization is fueled by internal aspirations for growth and fulfillment.
