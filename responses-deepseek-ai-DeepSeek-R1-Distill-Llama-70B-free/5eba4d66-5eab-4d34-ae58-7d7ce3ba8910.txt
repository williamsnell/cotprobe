Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the number of coulombs of positive charge in 250 cm³ of neutral water. Hmm, let me break this down step by step. 

First, I remember that water is H₂O, so each molecule has two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. The hint says that each hydrogen has one proton and oxygen has eight. So, each water molecule has 2*(1) + 8 = 10 protons in total. Wait, but wait, each hydrogen has one proton, right? So yeah, 2 from hydrogen and 8 from oxygen, that's 10 protons per molecule.

Now, since water is neutral overall, the number of electrons equals the number of protons, so the charge is balanced. But the question is about positive charge, which comes from the protons. So each molecule contributes 10 positive charges, each charge being +e, where e is the elementary charge, approximately 1.6×10⁻¹⁹ coulombs.

Next, I need to find out how many water molecules are in 250 cm³. To do that, I should probably calculate the number of moles of water in that volume. I remember that the density of water is about 1 g/cm³, so 250 cm³ is 250 grams of water.

The molar mass of water is approximately 18 grams per mole because H is about 1 each and O is 16. So 18 g/mol. So, moles of water would be mass divided by molar mass: 250 g / 18 g/mol ≈ 13.89 moles.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that calculation. 250 divided by 18. Let me compute: 18 *13 is 234, 18*14 is 252. So 250 is just under 14, so 250/18 is approximately 13.888... moles, yes.

Now, each mole has Avogadro's number of molecules, which is about 6.022×10²³ molecules/mol. So the total number of molecules is 13.888 mol * 6.022e23 molecules/mol. Let me compute that: 13.888 *6.022e23.

Let me approximate 13.888 as about 13.89 for easier calculation. So 13.89 *6.022e23 = let's compute 13 *6.022e23 is about 7.8286e24, and 0.89 *6.022e23 is about 5.36e23. Wait, no, perhaps it's better to just multiply 13.89 *6.022 first and then add the exponent.

13.89 *6.022 = Let's see, 10 *6.022=60.22, 3.89*6.022≈ around 23.44, so total about 83.66. So 83.66e23, which is 8.366e24 molecules.

Each molecule has 10 protons, so total protons would be 8.366e24 molecules *10 = 8.366e25 protons.

Each proton has a charge of +e, which is 1.6e-19 C. So total positive charge is 8.366e25 *1.6e-19 C.

Let me compute that: 8.366e25 *1.6e-19 = (8.366 *1.6) *1e6. 8 *1.6 is 12.8, 0.366*1.6≈0.5856, so total approximately 13.3856. So 13.3856e6 C, which is 1.33856e7 C.

Looking at the options, the choices are A: 1.3e7, B:7.8e6, etc. So 1.3e7 is option A.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let's go through again.

Volume: 250 cm³ = 250 mL. Density of water is 1g/cm³, so 250g. Molar mass H2O is 18 g/mol, so 250/18 ≈13.8889 moles.

Each mole has 6.022e23 molecules. So 13.8889 *6.022e23 = ?

Let me compute 13.8889 *6.022 = 

Well, 13 *6 =78, 13*0.022=0.286, so 78 +0.286=78.286.

0.8889 *6.022: 0.8 *6.022=4.8176, 0.0889 *6.022≈0.5348. So 4.8176 +0.5348≈5.3524.

Adding to 78.286, 78.286 +5.3524≈83.6384.

So 83.6384e23, which is 8.36384e24 molecules.

Each has 10 protons, so 8.36384e24 *10 =8.36384e25 protons.

Charge per proton is 1.6e-19 C, so total charge is 8.36384e25 *1.6e-19 = (8.36384 *1.6) *1e6.

8 *1.6=12.8, 0.36384 *1.6≈0.582. So 12.8 +0.582=13.382.

So 13.382e6 C, which is 1.3382e7 C. So approximately 1.34e7 C.

Looking back at the options, option A is 1.3e7, which is 1.3×10^7 C. So that's the closest.

But wait, let me check if I forgot any steps. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of protons per molecule. Wait, each H has one proton, O has 8, so per molecule, 2*(1) +8=10 protons. Yep, that's correct.

Another thing to check: did I correctly calculate the number of moles? 250g /18g/mol is approximately 13.888... yes.

Hmm, why isn't option A exactly 1.3e7? Because my calculation gives 1.338e7, which is about 1.34e7, but the option is 1.3e7. But perhaps the approximated values caused this. Let me see if the exact calculation gives a closer figure.

Let me compute without approximating so quickly. Let's compute 250/18 more accurately: 18 *13=234, so 250-234=16. 16/18=0.8888... So 13.8888... moles.

Each mole of H2O has 6.022e23 molecules, so 13.8888... *6.022e23.

Let me compute 13.8888 *6.022.

13 *6.022 =78.286.

0.8888 *6.022 = Let me compute 0.8 *6.022=4.8176, 0.08*6.022=0.48176, 0.008*6.022=0.048176, 0.0008*6.022=0.0048176. Wait, no, 0.8888 is 0.8 + 0.08 +0.008 +0.0008?

Wait, 0.8888 is 0.8 +0.08 +0.0088, perhaps. Maybe a better approach: 0.8888 *6.022 = ?

Let me compute 6.022 *0.8 =4.8176.

6.022 *0.08 =0.48176.

6.022 *0.0088= Approximately 6.022 *0.008=0.048176, and 6.022 *0.0008=0.0048176. So 0.048176 +0.0048176=0.0529936.

Adding all together: 4.8176 +0.48176=5.29936, plus 0.0529936=5.35235.

So 78.286 +5.35235=83.63835.

So 83.63835e23 molecules, which is 8.363835e24 molecules.

Multiply by 10 (protons per molecule): 8.363835e25 protons.

Each proton charge is 1.602176634e-19 C (exact value, but I'll use 1.6e-19 for approximation).

So 8.363835e25 *1.6e-19 = (8.363835 *1.6) *1e6.

8 *1.6=12.8, 0.363835 *1.6= approx 0.582136. So total 12.8 +0.582136=13.382136.

So 13.382136e6 C =1.3382136e7 C.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.3e7, which is 1.3×10^7 C. The next option higher is G:2.0e7, which is higher. So my calculated value is approximately 1.34e7, which is closer to 1.3e7 than any other option. So the answer should be option A.

Wait, but wait another thing. Wait, 250 cm³ is 0.25 liters. Did I miscalculate the grams? Because 1 cm³ is 1 mL, which weighs 1 gram. So 250 cm³ is 250 grams. Correct.

Yes, seems right. So the answer is option A.

To calculate the number of coulombs of positive charge in 250 cm³ of neutral water, we proceed as follows:

1. **Determine the number of protons per water molecule**:  
   Water (H₂O) contains 2 hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom. Each hydrogen atom has 1 proton, and oxygen has 8 protons. Thus, each water molecule has:  
   \[
   2 \times 1 + 8 = 10 \, \text{protons}.
   \]

2. **Calculate the mass of water in 250 cm³**:  
   The density of water is \(1 \, \text{g/cm}^3\), so \(250 \, \text{cm}^3\) corresponds to \(250 \, \text{g}\) of water.

3. **Determine the number of moles of water**:  
   The molar mass of water is \(18 \, \text{g/mol}\). The number of moles is:  
   \[
   \frac{250 \, \text{g}}{18 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 13.89 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of water molecules**:  
   Each mole contains Avogadro's number of molecules, \(6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{molecules/mol}\). The total number of molecules is:  
   \[
   13.89 \, \text{mol} \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{molecules/mol} \approx 8.366 \times 10^{24} \, \text{molecules}.
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of protons**:  
   Each molecule has 10 protons, so the total number of protons is:  
   \[
   8.366 \times 10^{24} \, \text{molecules} \times 10 \, \text{protons/molecule} = 8.366 \times 10^{25} \, \text{protons}.
   \]

6. **Convert protons to coulombs**:  
   Each proton has a charge of \(1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}\). The total positive charge is:  
   \[
   8.366 \times 10^{25} \, \text{protons} \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C/proton} = 1.338 \times 10^{7} \, \text{C}.
   \]

7. **Compare with the options**:  
   The closest option to \(1.338 \times 10^{7} \, \text{C}\) is \(1.3 \times 10^{7} \, \text{C}\), which corresponds to **option A**.
