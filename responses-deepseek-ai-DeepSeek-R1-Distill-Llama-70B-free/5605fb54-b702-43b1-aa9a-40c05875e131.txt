Question:

A homeowner wished to have his house painted. He contacted a number of house painters in his area and asked them to submit bids to do the work. The homeowner received 10 bids. The first nine offered to paint the house for amounts ranging from $10,000 to $12,500. The 10th bid was sent by telegram and was supposed to be for $10,000. However, the telegraph company made a mistake and transmitted the bid as $1,000. The homeowner immediately accepted the 1 0th bid, but the 1 0 painter refused to perform. The I 0th painter's best defense in an action for breach of contract by the homeowner would be

Options:

A: that the homeowner should have been aware of the mistaken transmission, because of the disparity between its bid and the others.
B: that the telegraph company should be liable as an independent contractor.
C: that the homeowner deliberately exploited the telegraph company's mistake.
D: that the telegraph company's mistake nullifies the contractual agreement.
E: that the homeowner's immediate acceptance of the bid was unreasonable.
F: that the discrepancy between the bid and the actual cost of painting is too large.
G: that the homeowner was under an affirmative duty to investigate all submitted bids.
H: that the bid was not legally binding as it was sent via telegram.
I: that the homeowner failed to provide accurate specifications for the job.

Okay, so I've got this question about contract law, particularly focusing on mistakes in contract formation. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The scenario is that a homeowner wanted his house painted and got 10 bids. The first nine bids were between $10k and $12.5k. The tenth bid was meant to be $10k but was sent as $1k due to a telegraph error. The homeowner accepted the $1k bid, but the painter refused to do the work. Now, the painter is being sued for breach of contract, and we need to figure out the painter's best defense.

Hmm, I remember that contract law deals with offers, acceptances, and consideration. Also, the concept of mistake is crucial here. There are different types of mistakesâ€”like unilateral and mutual. A unilateral mistake is when one party makes a mistake, and the other party knows or should know about it. On the other hand, mutual mistakes are when both parties make a mistake, but that's not the case here.

So the painter sent a bid of $10k, but it was transmitted as $1k. The homeowner jumped on the $1k offer. The painter's defense would probably revolve around the mistake and whether a contract was actually formed.

I think about the rule that if a mistake is so obvious that a reasonable person would realize it's a mistake, then the contract might not be enforceable. Like, if someone offers to sell a car for $100 but meant $10,000, the buyer can't hold them to that if it's a clear mistake.

In this case, the other bids were in the $10k range, so the $1k bid is way off. A reasonable person would probably notice that it's way lower than the others and maybe suspect a mistake. So the homeowner either knew or should have known that there was a mistake in the bid.

Looking at the answer options, option A says that the homeowner should have been aware because of the disparity. That makes sense because $1k is much lower than the other bids. So the painter's defense would be that the homeowner should have recognized the mistake, making the contract voidable or unenforceable.

Option E says the immediate acceptance was unreasonable. Well, the homeowner did accept it quickly, but I think the key is the reasonableness of knowing about the mistake, not just the speed of acceptance.

Option C suggests the homeowner exploited the mistake. That might be true, but the legal point is more about whether the mistake was so obvious that the contract shouldn't hold.

So the best defense would be that the homeowner should have known about the mistake because of the huge difference in the bid compared to others. So the answer would be A.

The scenario involves a homeowner who accepted a painter's bid that was mistakenly transmitted as $1,000 instead of $10,000 due to a telegraph error. The painter refused to perform, and the homeowner sued for breach of contract. The painter's best defense would focus on the doctrine of mistake in contract law, specifically the principle that a contract based on a unilateral mistake (known or reasonably discoverable by the other party) may be unenforceable.

Among the options provided, the strongest defense is that the homeowner should have been aware of the mistake due to the significant disparity between the $1,000 bid and the other bids, which ranged from $10,000 to $12,500. A reasonable person would have recognized such a glaring discrepancy and investigated further before accepting the offer. This aligns with the legal principle that a contract cannot be enforced if the non-mistaken party knew or should have known of the mistake.
