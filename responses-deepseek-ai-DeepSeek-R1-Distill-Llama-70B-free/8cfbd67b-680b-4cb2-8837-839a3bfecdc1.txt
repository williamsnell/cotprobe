Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully. The question is about spreading oil on water and finding the thickness of the oil film in angstroms. Hmm, I remember that this has to do with volume and area, probably using the formula for the volume of a very thin layer.

Alright, the problem states that one cubic millimeter of oil is spread over an area of one square meter. I need to find the thickness in angstroms. I'm a bit rusty on unit conversions, but let's try to break it down step by step.

First, I know that volume is equal to area multiplied by thickness. So if I have the volume and the area, I can solve for the thickness. The formula would be thickness = volume / area.

The given volume is 1 cubic millimeter. Wait, what's a cubic millimeter in other units? Oh right, 1 mm is 0.001 meters, so 1 cubic mm is (0.001 m)^3. Let me calculate that. (0.001)^3 is 1e-9 cubic meters. So that's 1e-9 m³.

The area is 1 square meter. So the thickness should be 1e-9 m³ divided by 1 m². That gives me 1e-9 meters. Wait, that's 1e-9 meters. But we need to convert that to angstroms. I remember that 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters. So 1e-9 meters is 10 angstroms. Oh wait, let me double-check that.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters. So 1e-9 meters is 10 times larger than 1e-10, meaning it's 10 angstroms. Right, so 1e-9 m = 10 Å.

Hmm, so the thickness is 10 angstroms. Let me look at the options. Option H is 10 Å, so that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in unit conversion. Let me go through the steps again. Volume is 1 mm³. Since 1 m = 1000 mm, 1 mm is 1e-3 m. So 1 mm³ is (1e-3)^3 = 1e-9 m³. Area is 1 m². So thickness is 1e-9 m³ / 1 m² = 1e-9 m. Since 1 Å is 1e-10 m, 1e-9 m is 10 Å. Yes, that's right.

So the answer should be H: 10 Å.

To determine the thickness of the oil film in angstroms, we start with the relationship between volume, area, and thickness: 

\[
\text{Thickness} = \frac{\text{Volume}}{\text{Area}}
\]

The given volume of oil is \(1 \, \text{mm}^3\). Converting this to cubic meters:

\[
1 \, \text{mm}^3 = (1 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m})^3 = 1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}^3
\]

The area over which the oil is spread is \(1 \, \text{m}^2\). Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
\text{Thickness} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}^3}{1 \, \text{m}^2} = 1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}
\]

Next, we convert \(1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}\) to angstroms. Since \(1 \, \text{Å} = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\):

\[
1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} = 10 \, \text{Å}
\]

Thus, the thickness of the oil film is \(10 \, \text{Å}\). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**H: 10 Å**

Answer: H
