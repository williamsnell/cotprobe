Okay, so I have this problem about the decomposition of SO₂Cl₂ and I need to find out two things: part (a) is the time it takes for the concentration to reduce to 10% of the original, and part (b) is how much is left after 6.5 hours. It's a first-order reaction, so I remember the equation ln([A]/[A₀]) = -kt. Or wait, actually the equation is ln([A₀]/[A]) = kt, right? Because as time increases, the concentration [A] decreases, so [A₀]/[A] is greater than 1, and the natural log of that would be positive, which matches with kt being positive.

First, I need to find the rate constant k. They give the half-life as 4.00 hours. For a first-order reaction, the half-life formula is t₁/₂ = ln(2)/k. So I can solve for k. Let me write that down: k = ln(2)/t₁/₂. Ln(2) is approximately 0.693. So k = 0.693 / 4.00. Let me calculate that. 0.693 divided by 4 is 0.17325 per hour. So k is about 0.1733 hr⁻¹.

Now, part (a): Time to reduce to 10% of original. So [A] is 10% of [A₀], which means [A]/[A₀] = 0.10. Using the equation, ln([A₀]/[A]) = kt. Substituting 0.10, I get ln(1/0.10) = kt. Wait, ln(10) is about 2.3026. So 2.3026 = kt. I know k is 0.1733, so t = 2.3026 / 0.1733. Let me compute that. 2.3026 divided by 0.1733. Let's see, 0.1733 times 13 is about 2.2529. 2.3026 - 2.2529 is about 0.05, which is roughly 0.1733 * 0.288. So approx 13.288 hours. Wait, but let me calculate it more accurately. 0.1733 is 0.1733, so 2.3026 / 0.1733. Let me do division step by step. 0.1733 * 13 = 2.2529. Subtract that from 2.3026: 0.0497. Now, 0.0497 / 0.1733 ≈ 0.287. So total is 13.287 hours, about 13.29 hours. Let me check the options. Looking at the options, option E is 13.8, option H is 13.3. Hmm, so I got approximately 13.29, which is close to 13.3. So part (a) is about 13.3 hours.

Wait, but maybe let me compute more accurately. Let me calculate 2.302585093 / 0.17325. Let me use a calculator approach. Let's see, 0.17325 * 13 is 2.25225. Subtract that from 2.302585 gives 0.050335. Now, 0.050335 / 0.17325 = approx 0.2906. So 13.2906, so about 13.29 hours, which is approximately 13.3 hours. So option H is 13.3, but wait, looking at the options, option E is 13.8, which is higher. So part (a) is probably 13.3, which is option H's first part. Wait, but I should double-check.

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the equation. Because sometimes the formula is written as ln([A]/[A₀]) = -kt, so let me make sure. Let me restate the first-order equation. The correct equation is ln([A]/[A₀]) = -kt. So when [A] is 0.1 [A₀], it's ln(0.1) = -kt. So ln(0.1) is approximately -2.3026. So, -2.3026 = -kt → 2.3026 = kt. So same as before. So t is 2.3026 / 0.17325 ≈ 13.29 hours. So that's correct.

Now part (b): Starting with 100 mg, how much remains after 6.50 hours. So using the same equation. [A] = [A₀] * e^(-kt). So [A] = 100 mg * e^(-0.17325 * 6.5). Let me compute the exponent: 0.17325 * 6.5. 0.17325 * 6 is 1.0395, and 0.17325 * 0.5 is 0.086625. So total is 1.0395 + 0.086625 = 1.126125. So exponent is -1.126125. e^-1.1261 is approximately... Let me think. e^-1 is about 0.3679. e^-1.1261 is less than that. Let me calculate it. Let me remember that ln(0.324) is about -1.13. Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Alternatively, I can use the formula or a calculator if I were doing this on paper, but since I'm thinking, perhaps I can approximate.

Alternatively, perhaps using a Taylor series, but that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can remember that e^-1.1 is about 0.332, and e^-1.126 is a bit lower. Let me compute 1.126 as 1 + 0.126. So e^-1.126 ≈ e^-1 * e^-0.126. e^-1 is 0.3679, e^-0.126 is approximately 1 - 0.126 + (0.126^2)/2 - ... Let me compute e^-0.126 using the expansion. 

e^x ≈ 1 + x + x²/2 + x³/6 for small x. But since x is negative, e^-0.126 = 1 - 0.126 + (0.126)^2/2 - (0.126)^3/6. Let's compute each term:

x = -0.126:

Term 0: 1

Term 1: -0.126 → sum so far 0.874

Term 2: (0.126)^2 / 2 = 0.015876 / 2 = 0.007938 → sum 0.874 + 0.007938 = 0.881938

Term 3: -(0.126)^3 / 6 → 0.002000 / 6 ≈ 0.000333 → subtract 0.000333 → 0.881938 - 0.000333 ≈ 0.881605

So e^-0.126 ≈ 0.8816. Thus, e^-1.126 ≈ 0.3679 * 0.8816 ≈ Let's compute that. 0.3679 * 0.88 = 0.3233, 0.3679 * 0.0016= 0.000589. So total ≈ 0.3233 + 0.000589 = 0.3239. So approximately 0.3239.

So [A] = 100 mg * 0.3239 ≈ 32.39 mg. Let me check the options for part (b). So looking at the options, for part (b), which is the second value in each option.

Looking at the options, for example, option H is 13.3, 32.6. So 32.39 is close to 32.6. So that makes sense. So part (b) is approx 32.4 mg, which is closest to option H's 32.6 mg. Hmm, but wait, let me see if I made a mistake. Maybe I should compute the exponent more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the exact calculation. Let's compute 0.17325 * 6.5. 0.17325 * 6 is 1.0395. 0.17325 * 0.5 is 0.086625. So sum is 1.0395 + 0.086625 = 1.126125. So exponent is -1.126125. Now, let me calculate e^-1.126125.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that ln(0.324) is about -1.13, as I thought earlier. So if the exponent is -1.126, then e^-1.126 ≈ 0.324 * e^(0.004). Because 1.126 = 1.13 - 0.004. So e^-1.126 = e^-1.13 * e^0.004. e^-1.13 is 0.322, and e^0.004 is approximately 1.004008. So 0.322 * 1.004008 ≈ 0.3233. So that brings back to approximately 0.3233.

So 100 mg * 0.3233 = 32.33 mg. So approx 32.33 mg. So looking at the options, the second part is 32.6 mg in option H. So that's very close. So the correct option would be H: 13.3 hrs, 32.6 mg.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations for any errors. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of k? Let me recalculate k.

Given t₁/₂ = 4.00 hours. k = ln(2) / t₁/₂. ln(2) is 0.693147. So 0.693147 / 4.00 = 0.17328675 per hour. So that's correct.

Then, part (a): t = ln(10) / k. Ln(10) is 2.302585. So 2.302585 / 0.17328675 ≈ Let me compute this accurately. Let me do 0.17328675 * 13.3 = ?

0.17328675 * 13 = 2.25272575

0.17328675 * 0.3 = 0.051986025

So sum is 2.25272575 + 0.051986025 = 2.304711775. That's very close to 2.302585. So 13.3 hours would give a product of k*t = 2.3047, which is a bit higher than 2.302585. So the actual t would be slightly less than 13.3. Let me compute t exactly. t = 2.302585 / 0.17328675.

Let me do the division: 2.302585 ÷ 0.17328675.

Let me compute 0.17328675 * 13.28 = ?

0.17328675 * 13 = 2.25272575.

0.17328675 * 0.28 = ?

0.17328675 * 0.2 = 0.03465735

0.17328675 * 0.08 = 0.01386314

Sum: 0.03465735 + 0.01386314 = 0.04852049

So 13.28 → 2.25272575 + 0.04852049 = 2.30124624

Which is very close to 2.302585. The difference is 2.302585 - 2.30124624 = 0.00133876.

So per 0.17328675, the additional time needed is 0.00133876 / 0.17328675 ≈ 0.00772 hours. So 0.00772 hours is about 0.00772 *60 ≈ 0.463 minutes, about 28 seconds. So t ≈ 13.28 + 0.00772 ≈ 13.2877 hours, which is approx 13.29 hours. So about 13.29, which is close to 13.3, so option H's first part is correct.

For part (b), the calculation was 32.33 mg, which is close to option H's 32.6 mg. So the correct answer is option H: 13.3 hrs, 32.6 mg.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is (13.3 hrs, 32.6 mg). But let me check if any other option has the part (b) close to 32.3. Let me look at the options:

Option B: 14.2, 33.2 → part (b) is 33.2.

Option E: 13.8, 31.5 → part (b) 31.5.

Option H is 32.6, which is closer to 32.3 than 33.2 or 31.5.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate part (b) more precisely. Let me compute e^(-1.126125) again.

Using a calculator approach, but since I can't use a calculator, perhaps I can find a better approximation. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the natural logarithm properties.

Wait, another approach: the formula for first-order is [A] = [A₀] * (1/2)^(t / t₁/₂). So t is 6.5 hours, t₁/₂ is 4. So t/t₁/₂ = 6.5 / 4 = 1.625. So [A] = 100 mg * (1/2)^1.625.

Compute (1/2)^1.625 = 2^(-1.625) = 1/(2^1.625). 2^1 = 2, 2^0.625. 2^0.5 is sqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142. 2^0.625 = 2^(5/8) = the 8th root of 2^5. 2^5 is 32, so 8th root of 32 is 32^(1/8). Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 2^0.625 as e^(0.625 * ln2). Ln2 is 0.6931, so 0.625 * 0.6931 ≈ 0.4332. e^0.4332 is approx 1.542. So 2^0.625 ≈ 1.542. So 2^1.625 = 2 * 1.542 = 3.084. So [A] = 100 / 3.084 ≈ 32.43 mg. So that's 32.43 mg, which is about 32.4 mg. So option H has 32.6 mg, which is very close. The next closest is option B's 33.2, which is a bit off. So H is the best fit.

So the correct answer should be option H.

To solve the problem, we start by determining the rate constant \( k \) using the half-life formula for a first-order reaction:  

\[
t_{1/2} = \frac{\ln(2)}{k} \implies k = \frac{\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}
\]

Given \( t_{1/2} = 4.00 \, \text{hours} \), we calculate:  

\[
k = \frac{0.693}{4.00} = 0.17325 \, \text{hr}^{-1}
\]

### Part (a): Time to reduce concentration to 10% of original  
For a first-order reaction, the equation is:  

\[
\ln\left(\frac{[A]}{[A_0]}\right) = -kt
\]

When \([A] = 0.10[A_0]\), we have:  

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{0.10}\right) = kt \implies \ln(10) = kt
\]

Substituting \( \ln(10) \approx 2.3026 \) and \( k = 0.17325 \):  

\[
t = \frac{2.3026}{0.17325} \approx 13.29 \, \text{hours}
\]

Thus, the time required for the concentration to reduce to 10% is approximately **13.3 hours**.

### Part (b): Weight of SO₂Cl₂ remaining after 6.50 hours  
Using the first-order equation in terms of concentration:  

\[
[A] = [A_0] e^{-kt}
\]

Starting with 100 mg, we calculate:  

\[
[A] = 100 \cdot e^{-0.17325 \cdot 6.50}
\]

First, compute the exponent:  

\[
-0.17325 \cdot 6.50 = -1.126125
\]

Now, calculate \( e^{-1.126125} \). Using approximations, \( e^{-1.126125} \approx 0.3239 \). Thus:  

\[
[A] = 100 \cdot 0.3239 \approx 32.39 \, \text{mg}
\]

This is very close to **32.6 mg**.

### Final Answer  
From the calculations, the correct option is:  

**H: 13.3 hrs, 32.6 mg**
