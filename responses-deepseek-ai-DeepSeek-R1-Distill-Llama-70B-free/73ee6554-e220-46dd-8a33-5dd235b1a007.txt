Okay, so I've got this problem about a four-pole DC generator. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my electric machines, but I'll take it slow.

The question has two parts: part (a) is to find the average generated voltage, and part (b) is about the rated current in each conductor. Let's start with part (a).

From what I remember, the average generated voltage in a DC generator can be calculated using the formula:

E_avg = (P * Φ * Z * N) / (60 * A)

Where:
- P is the number of poles.
- Φ is the flux per pole in maxwells.
- Z is the number of conductors.
- N is the speed in rpm.
- A is the number of parallel paths.

Wait, right, the formula might also be written with some constants. Sometimes I see it as (PΦZN)/(60A) multiplied by something else. Let me think. Oh wait, since flux is given in maxwells and speed in rpm, the formula is correct as I wrote it.

So let's plug in the numbers. The generator has 4 poles (P=4), flux per pole is 0.321e6 maxwells (Φ = 321,000), the armature has 648 conductors (Z=648), and it's rotating at 1800 rpm (N=1800). The armature winding has two parallel paths (A=2).

So substituting into the formula:

E_avg = (4 * 321000 * 648 * 1800) / (60 * 2)

Let me compute the numerator and denominator step by step.

First, calculate the numerator: 4 * 321000 = 1,284,000. Then multiply by 648: 1,284,000 * 648. Hmm, that's a big number. Let me do it in parts. 1,284,000 * 600 = 770,400,000. 1,284,000 * 48 = let's see, 1,284,000 * 40 is 51,360,000 and 1,284,000 * 8 is 10,272,000. Adding those gives 51,360,000 +10,272,000 = 61,632,000. So total numerator so far is 770,400,000 + 61,632,000 = 832,032,000. Then multiply by 1800. Wait wait, no, I think I messed up the order. The formula is (PΦZN), so after PΦ is 4 * 321000 = 1.284e6. Then Z is 648, so 1.284e6 *648 = let's calculate that.

Wait, maybe I should compute 1.284e6 * 648. Let me compute 1.284e6 * 600 = 770,400,000. 1.284e6 *48=61,632,000. So total is 770.4e6 +61.632e6 = 832,032,000. Then multiply by N=1800: 832,032,000 * 1800. Wait that's a huge number. Wait, maybe I'm doing this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute in steps.

Wait no, the formula is E_avg = (PΦZN) / (60A). So the numerator is 4 * 321000 * 648 * 1800. So let me compute each part:

4 * 321000 = 1,284,000.

Now 1,284,000 * 648: Let's calculate that.

1,284,000 * 600 = 770,400,000.

1,284,000 * 48 = 61,632,000.

Sum: 770,400,000 + 61,632,000 = 832,032,000.

Now multiply by 1800: 832,032,000 * 1800. That's 832,032,000 * 1.8e3. Let's compute 832,032,000 * 1e3 is 832,032,000,000. So 832,032,000,000 * 1.8 = ?

Wait, 832,032,000,000 * 1.8 = 1,497,657,600,000.

Now the denominator is 60 * 2 = 120.

So E_avg = 1,497,657,600,000 / 120.

Let me compute that division.

1,497,657,600,000 / 120 = (1,497,657,600,000 ÷ 10) ÷ 12 = 149,765,760,000 ÷ 12.

Dividing 149,765,760,000 by 12:

12 * 12,473,800,000 = 149,765,600,000. Close enough.

So 12,473,800,000 /12 = 1,039,483,333.333... So approximately 1,039,483 volts?

Wait, that can't be right. Volts can't be a million. I must have made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me double-check the formula. Oh wait, I think I forgot a factor. The correct formula is E_avg = (P * Φ * Z * N) / (60 * A). But wait, I think I might be missing a factor of 1e-6 because flux is given in maxwells. Or perhaps not. Wait, maxwell is the unit of flux, so Φ is in maxwells, but in the formula, it's in webers. Oh wait, no—1 maxwell is 1e-8 weber. So I think I need to convert maxwells to webers by multiplying by 1e-8.

Wait wait, I think I messed up the units. Because the formula uses Φ in webers, right? So if the flux per pole is 0.321e6 maxwells, that's 0.321e6 maxwells * 1e-8 Wb/maxwell = 0.321e6 * 1e-8 = 0.321 * 1e-2 = 0.00321 Wb.

Ah! So that's where I went wrong. I used Φ as 321,000 maxwells, but actually, I need to convert it to webers by multiplying by 1e-8.

So let me correct that. So Φ is 0.321e6 maxwells = 0.321e6 *1e-8 = 0.0321 webers.

Wait wait, 0.321e6 is 321,000. 321,000 * 1e-8 = 3.21e-2, which is 0.0321 webers.

So the correct calculation would be:

E_avg = (P * Φ * Z * N) / (60 * A)

So substituting the numbers:

P =4, Φ=0.0321 Wb, Z=648, N=1800 rpm, A=2.

So plug in:

E_avg = (4 * 0.0321 * 648 * 1800) / (60 * 2)

Let me compute each part step by step.

First compute numerator:

4 * 0.0321 = 0.1284.

0.1284 * 648 = Let's calculate that.

648 * 0.1284.

Well, 648 * 0.1 is 64.8.

648 * 0.02 is 12.96.

648 * 0.0084 is approximately 648 *0.008=5.184, 648*0.0004=0.2592. So 5.184+0.2592=5.4432.

Adding them all together: 64.8 +12.96 =77.76 +5.4432=83.2032.

So 0.1284 *648 =83.2032.

Now multiply by 1800: 83.2032 *1800.

83.2032 * 1000 = 83,203.2

83.2032 * 800 = 66,562.56

Adding them: 83,203.2 +66,562.56=149,765.76.

So numerator is 149,765.76.

Denominator is 60 *2=120.

So E_avg = 149,765.76 / 120.

Calculating that: 149765.76 ÷ 120.

Well, 120 * 1248 = 149,760. So 1248 volts would give 149,760, and the remaining 5.76 would be 5.76/120=0.048 volts.

So E_avg ≈1248.048 volts? That can't be right because the options are all in 100-170 volts. I must have made a mistake again.

Wait a second, maybe I made an error in calculating 4 * 0.0321. Let me recalculate.

4 * 0.0321 = 0.1284. That's correct.

Then 0.1284 *648: Let me do this again.

0.1284 * 600 = 77.04.

0.1284 *48: Let's compute 0.1284 *40=5.136, 0.1284*8=1.0272. So 5.136+1.0272=6.1632.

Adding 77.04 +6.1632=83.2032. So that's correct.

Hmm, but when I multiply 83.2032 by 1800, I'm getting 149,765.76. Then divide by 120 gives 1248 volts. But that's way higher than any of the options. So I'm definitely doing something wrong.

Wait, maybe the formula is wrong. Let me double-check the formula for average generated voltage.

The standard formula is E = (PΦZN)/(60A). So that's what I used. But maybe I forgot to account for lap or wave windings. Oh wait, in this problem, the armature has two parallel paths. So A=2, which I correctly used.

Wait, but another thought: the formula for generated voltage is sometimes written as E = (P * Φ * Z * N) / (60 * A). But wait, sometimes it's written as E = (Φ * Z * N * P) / (60 * A * C), where C is the number of conductors in series. Wait, no, maybe I'm confusing with another formula.

Wait, another possibility: the formula might involve the number of conductors per path. But no, the formula I used should be correct.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, the Z is 648 conductors. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the flux conversion. Let me recheck that.

Flux per pole is 0.321 ×10^6 maxwells. Oh wait, 0.321e6 is 321,000 maxwells. Since 1 weber is 1e8 maxwells, so 321,000 maxwells is 321,000 / 1e8 = 0.00321 webers. Oh! Wait, earlier I said 0.321e6 is 321,000, which is correct. So 321,000 maxwells is 0.00321 Wb, not 0.0321. Because 1e6 maxwells is 0.01 Wb, so 0.321e6 maxwells is 0.321e6 * 1e-8 = 0.00321 Wb.

So earlier, I think I used 0.0321 by mistake. Let me correct that.

So Φ is 0.00321 Wb.

So redoing the calculation:

E_avg = (4 * 0.00321 * 648 * 1800) / (60 * 2)

Compute numerator:

4 * 0.00321 = 0.01284.

0.01284 *648: Let's compute that.

648 * 0.01 =6.48.

648 * 0.00284: Let's calculate 648 * 0.002 =1.296; 648 *0.00084=0.54432.

So 1.296 +0.54432=1.84032.

Adding to 6.48: 6.48 +1.84032=8.32032.

So 0.01284 *648=8.32032.

Multiply by 1800: 8.32032 *1800.

8 *1800=14,400.

0.32032 *1800: 0.3*1800=540; 0.02032*1800≈36.576.

So 540+36.576=576.576.

Total: 14,400 +576.576=14,976.576.

Denominator: 60 *2=120.

So E_avg =14,976.576 /120.

Dividing 14,976.576 by 120:

120 *124 =14,880.

14,976.576 -14,880=96.576.

96.576 /120=0.805.

So E_avg=124 +0.805≈124.805 volts.

So approximately 124.8 volts. Looking at the options, the closest is option J: (a) 120 volts, or option I: 150, or option D:130, or option A:110. So 124.8 is between 120 and 130. But wait, maybe I made a miscalculation again.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation of 8.32032 *1800.

Wait, 8 *1800=14,400.

0.32032 *1800: Let's compute 0.3 *1800=540, 0.02032*1800=36.576. So 540+36.576=576.576.

So 14,400 +576.576=14,976.576.

Divide by 120: 14,976.576 ÷ 120 = ?

Let me compute 14,976.576 / 120.

120 * 124 = 14,880.

14,976.576 -14,880 = 96.576.

96.576 /120 = 0.805.

So 124.805 volts. So about 124.8 volts, which is approximately 125 volts. Looking at the options, option B is (a) 125 volts.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option B: (a)125, (b)20 amp. Hmm. So that would fit for part (a).

But let me think again about the calculation. Did I make any error in the steps? For instance, when I calculated 4 * 0.00321, that gives 0.01284, correct. Then 0.01284 *648=8.32032, correct. Multiply by 1800: 8.32032 *1800=14,976.576, correct.

Divide by (60 *2)=120: 14,976.576/120=124.805 V.

So approximately 124.8 V, which can be rounded to 125 V, so option B's part (a) is correct.

Now moving on to part (b): calculate the rated current in each conductor (per path) if the power delivered by the armature is 5 kW.

Wait, each conductor is part of a parallel path. The armature has two parallel paths, so the total current is split between them.

Power P = 5 kW =5000 W.

Power is also equal to E_avg * I_total, where I_total is the total armature current.

So I_total = P / E_avg.

We found E_avg ≈124.8 volts.

I_total =5000 /124.8 ≈40.07 amps.

But wait, since the armature has two parallel paths, each path carries I_total /2. So current per path I_path= I_total /2.

I_path =40.07 /2 ≈20.035 amps.

So each parallel path carries about 20 amps.

Wait, but each conductor is in a path. Wait, the question says, "rated current in each conductor (per path) if the power delivered by the armature is 5 kw."

Wait, so each parallel path has several conductors. So the current per conductor would be I_path divided by the number of conductors per path? Or perhaps I'm confusing something.

Wait, the armature winding has a total of 648 conductors in two parallel paths. So each path has 648/2=324 conductors in series.

Wait, no, parallel paths mean that the current divides. If each path has 324 conductors in series, then each conductor in a path carries the same current as the path current, since they're in series. Wait, no, conductors in series don't split current. So in each path, the current is the same through each conductor in that path.

Wait, but that would mean that each conductor carries the same current as the path's total current. So if each path is carrying 20.035 amps, each conductor in that path has 20.035 amps.

But that can't be right because the options for part (b) are in the 15-33 amp range. Option B's part (b) is 20 amp, which matches our calculation.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The power delivered is 5 kW. The average voltage is about 125 V. So total current is 5000/125=40 A. Since there are two parallel paths, each path carries 20 A. Since each conductor is in one of the two paths, each conductor would carry 20 A. So that's correct.

So part (a) is 125 V, part (b) is 20 A. So option B is the answer.
</think>

To solve the problem, we calculate the average generated voltage and the rated current in each conductor using the given data:

### Part (a): Average Generated Voltage
The formula for the average generated voltage in a DC generator is:

\[
E_{\text{avg}} = \frac{P \cdot \Phi \cdot Z \cdot N}{60 \cdot A}
\]

Where:
- \( P = 4 \) (number of poles),
- \( \Phi = 0.321 \times 10^6 \, \text{maxwells} = 0.00321 \, \text{Wb} \) (flux per pole, converted to webers),
- \( Z = 648 \) (total number of conductors),
- \( N = 1800 \, \text{rpm} \) (speed of rotation),
- \( A = 2 \) (number of parallel paths).

Substituting the values:

\[
E_{\text{avg}} = \frac
