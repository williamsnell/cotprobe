Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
I have, in conformity without resolve, put together some few points concerning the reformation of the Christian estate, with the intent of placing the same before the Christian nobility of the German nation. . . . It is not out of mere arrogance and perversity that I, an individual poor man, have taken upon me to address your lordships. The distress and misery that oppress all the Christian estates, more especially in Germany, have led not only myself, but every one else, to cry aloud and to ask for help. . . . These Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls around themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly. . . . That the Temporal Power Has no Jurisdiction over the Spirituality . . . That No One May Interpret the Scriptures but the Pope . . . That No One May Call a Council but the Pope. . . . Let us now consider the matters which should be treated in the councils, and with which popes, cardinals, bishops, and all learned men should occupy themselves day and night. . . . It is a distressing and terrible thing to see that the head of Christendom, who boasts of being the vicar of Christ and the successor of St. Peter, lives in a worldly pomp that no king or emperor can equal. What is the use in Christendom of the people called "cardinals"? I will tell you. In Italy and Germany there are many rich convents, endowments, fiefs, and benefices, and as the best way of getting these into the hands of Rome, they created cardinals, and gave them the sees, convents, and prelacies, and thus destroyed the service of God.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Martin Luther's letter, Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation. I'm a bit rusty on Protestant Reformation stuff, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which topic Luther avoided speaking about in his letter. The options are A to J, each covering different aspects like church wealth, indulgences, political nature, etc.

Let me first recall what I know about this letter. I remember that Luther wrote this to address the German nobles, urging them to take action against the corruption in the Catholic Church. He criticized several practices and structures within the Church.

Looking at the passage provided, he talks about three walls the Romanists (Catholic Church) built. The first is that the temporal power has no jurisdiction over spirituality. The second is that only the Pope can interpret Scriptures. The third is that only the Pope can call a council. So he's definitely talking about the role of the Pope (option D) and the power of the clergy (F), as well as the interpretation of Scriptures by the Pope (I).

He also discusses the worldly pomp of the Pope, comparing it to kings and emperors, which relates to the wealth of the church (A) and the head's lifestyle (H). The creation of cardinals (E) is mentioned as a way for Rome to gain control over riches in Italy and Germany, so that's covered.

He mentions that the distress and misery in Christendom led him to cry out, which implies he's talking about corruption within the church (J). The reformation of the Christian estate (G) is the main theme of the letter, so he definitely covers that.

Wait, the question is about what he avoided. Let's go through the options again. Option B is the sale of indulgences. From the passage, I don't see Luther mentioning indulgences here. He talks about the structures like cardinals and the Pope's power but not specifically about indulgences. I think his 95 Theses were more about that, but this letter seems to focus on the hierarchy and their corruption, not the sale of indulgences directly.

So, the letter avoids discussing the sale of indulgences. Therefore, the answer should be B.
