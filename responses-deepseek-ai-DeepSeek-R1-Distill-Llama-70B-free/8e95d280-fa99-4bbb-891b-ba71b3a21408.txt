Okay, so I've got this problem here about a virus spreading in a town, and I need to figure out the earliest date when everyone would be infected. Let me break it down step by step.

Alright, the situation is that the number of people with the virus doubles every 3 days. The town has 1,000 people, and on January 1st, 10 people are infected. I need to find out when the entire town (all 1,000) would be infected.

Hmm, so starting from January 1st with 10 cases. Since it's doubling every 3 days, I guess I can model this growth using exponential growth. The formula for exponential growth is N(t) = N0 * 2^(t/doubling_time), where N0 is the initial number.

Wait, but I should probably think in terms of how many doublings are needed to reach 1,000 from 10. Let me calculate that.

So, starting with 10 people:

- After 3 days: 20
- After 6 days: 40
- 9 days: 80
- 12 days: 160
- 15 days: 320
- 18 days: 640
- 21 days: 1280

Wait, 1280 is more than 1000, so that would mean on the 21st day, the number of infected people exceeds the town's population. But wait, the town only has 1000 people. So the earliest date when everyone is infected would be when the number reaches or surpasses 1000.

But wait, let's do this more accurately. Let me use the exponential formula to find the exact time when N(t) >=1000.

We have N(t) =10 * 2^(t/3). We need N(t) >=1000.

So, 2^(t/3) >= 100.

Taking logarithms on both sides. Let's use natural log for simplicity. ln(2^(t/3)) >= ln(100)
That simplifies to (t/3)*ln(2) >= ln(100)
So, t >= (ln(100) / ln(2)) *3

Calculating that:

ln(100) is approximately 4.605, and ln(2) is about 0.693.

So, 4.605 / 0.693 ≈ 6.644. Multiply by 3 gives t ≈19.93 days. So approximately 20 days.

Wait, so around 20 days after January 1st.

But wait, let's recount because initially I thought by day 21, it's 1280, which is over 1000. So 20 days would be when? Let me see.

Wait, the doubling times are every 3 days. Let me list each step in days:

Day 0: 10
Day 3: 20
Day 6:40
Day9:80
Day12:160
Day15:320
Day18:640
Day21:1280

So on day 21, it's 1280. But 1280 is more than 1000, so the infection reaches 1000 before day 21. Because on day 18, it's 640, which is less than 1000, and then on day 21, it's 1280.

Wait, so maybe the exact time is between day 18 and 21. Let me find when it crosses 1000.

At day 18: 640
At day 21: 1280

So the growth between days 18 and 21 is from 640 to 1280. So it's doubling once in 3 days.

We can model this as:

At day t (where t is between 18 and 21), the number of infected is 640 * 2^((t-18)/3).

We need this to be >=1000.

So 640 * 2^((t-18)/3) >=1000.

Divide both sides by 640:

2^((t-18)/3) >= 1000/640 = 1.5625

Take natural log:

((t-18)/3)*ln(2) >= ln(1.5625)

ln(1.5625) ≈ 0.444.

So (t-18)/3 >= 0.444 / 0.693 ≈ 0.64.

Multiply both sides by 3:

t-18 >= 1.92 days.

So t >= 18 +1.92 = 19.92 days. So approximately 19.92 days after Jan 1.

So that's about 19 days and 22 hours. So 20 days.

Wait, but let me count the days starting from January 1st as day 0.

Wait, no, wait. January 1st is the starting point, which is day 0. So day 3 is January 4th, day 6 is Jan 7th, etc.

Wait, let me clarify the dates.

January has 31 days, so I can map the days to dates.

Let me count each 3-day interval:

Day 0: Jan 1 → 10 infected.

Day 3: Jan 4 → 20.

Day 6: Jan 7 →40.

Day 9: Jan 10 →80.

Day 12: Jan 13 →160.

Day 15: Jan 16 →320.

Day 18: Jan 19 →640.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 18 days after Jan 1 is Jan 19, because day 0 is Jan 1.

So day 18 is Jan 19.

At day 18: 640 cases.

Then, day 21 would be Jan 22 (because 18+3=21; Jan 19 +3 days is 22nd).

Wait, but earlier calculation shows that at day 21 (Jan 22), it's 1280.

But wait, our calculation said that the number reaches 1000 around day 19.92, which is about day 20, so Jan 21.

So when is 1000 reached?

Wait, perhaps using a different approach.

The number of cases on any day can be determined by 10 * 2^(t/3), where t is days since Jan 1.

We need to find t when 10*2^(t/3) =1000 → 2^(t/3)=100 → t=3*log2(100).

As before, log2(100)= approx 6.644, so t=3*6.644≈19.93 days.

So 19.93 days after Jan 1st.

Now, how to convert 19.93 days into a date.

January has 31 days. So adding 19 days to Jan 1 brings us to Jan 20th (since Jan 1 is day 0, day 1 is Jan 2nd, etc.? Wait, maybe I'm getting the day count wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of day 0 is Jan 1.

So:

- Day 0: Jan 1

- Day 1: Jan 2

- ...

- Day 19: Jan 20

- Day 20: Jan 21

But wait, the exact time is 19.93 days, which is 19 days and about 22.3 hours. So that would be Jan 21st at around 10:16 AM.

But the question asks for the earliest date when the entire town is infected. So if on day 19.93 (approx Jan 21st), the infection reaches 1000, then the date would be January 21st.

Looking at the options, option H is January 21st.

But wait, let me double-check the progression.

Let me list the dates and the number of infected:

- Jan 1 (Day 0): 10

- Jan 4 (Day 3): 20

- Jan 7 (Day 6):40

- Jan 10 (Day9):80

- Jan13 (Day12):160

- Jan16 (Day15):320

- Jan19 (Day18):640

- Jan22 (Day21):1280

Wait, so on Jan 19, 640. Then each day after, it's growing exponentially, but not doubling until the next 3 days.

Wait, no, the doubling happens every 3 days. So between Jan19 (640) and Jan22 (1280). So from Jan19 to Jan22, it's 3 days, and the number doubles.

So the number of infected on any day between Jan19 and Jan22 can be calculated as 640 * 2^((t-18)/3), where t is days since Jan1.

Wait, so for Jan20, t=19. So 640 * 2^( (19-18)/3 ) = 640 * 2^(1/3) ≈ 640 *1.26 ≈806.

Jan21: t=20 → 640 * 2^(2/3) ≈ 640 *1.587≈1017.

Ah, so on Jan21, the number is approximately 1017, which is over 1000.

So the earliest date when the entire town is infected is Jan21.

Looking back at the options, option H is January 21st.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.

Another approach: the time to reach 1000 is when N(t) =1000.

Using N(t) =10 * 2^(t/3).

So 10 * 2^(t/3) =1000 → 2^(t/3)=100 → t =3 * log2(100).

log2(100)= ln(100)/ln(2)≈4.605/0.693≈6.644.

t=3 *6.644≈19.93 days.

So 19.93 days after Jan 1.

Now, adding 19 days to Jan1: Jan1 +19 days= Jan20 (since Jan1 is day 0, Jan2 is day1, ..., Jan20 is day19).

Then, 0.93 of a day is about 0.93*24≈22.3 hours. So Jan20 22:00 is when it reaches 1000.

But the question is about the earliest date, which would be Jan21, because on Jan20, it's not yet 1000. But wait, on Jan21 at some point in the day, it crosses 1000.

But when the question asks for the earliest date, it's the first date when the infection reaches or surpasses 1000. So that would be Jan21.

Alternatively, perhaps we should consider that on Jan21, the total reaches 1017, which is when the entire town is infected.

So looking at the options, option H is Jan21st.

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem says that the number doubles every 3 days. So the growth is stepwise every 3 days. So perhaps I should model it as it doubles exactly on those days, not continuously.

In that case, on each 3-day mark, the number doubles.

So:

Jan1:10

Jan4:20

Jan7:40

Jan10:80

Jan13:160

Jan16:320

Jan19:640

Jan22:1280

So 1280 is on Jan22. But wait, the town only has 1000 people. So the infection can't be more than 1000. So the latest date when the number reaches 1000 would be the first day when the number is >=1000.

But in the stepwise model, on Jan19 (day18), it's 640. Then the next doubling is on Jan22 (day21) to 1280. But 1280 is more than 1000, so the infection would have reached 1000 before Jan22.

But in the stepwise doubling model, the number doesn't increase between the 3-day intervals. So in reality, the number would reach 1000 partway between Jan19 and Jan22.

Wait, but in the stepwise model, you can't have partial days. So perhaps the infection count only updates every 3 days.

Wait, no, that's not realistic. The question says the number doubles every 3 days, which implies continuous growth, not stepwise.

So perhaps my initial continuous approach is correct, and the answer is Jan21st.

So the correct option is H: January 21st.
</think>

To determine the earliest date when the entire town of 1,000 people is infected, we start with the given information:

- On January 1st, 10 people are infected.
- The number of infected people doubles every 3 days.

Using the exponential growth formula:

\[
N(t) = N_0 \cdot 2^{t/3}
\]

where \(N_0 = 10\) (initial number of infected people) and \(t\) is the time in days since January 1st. We need to find \(t\) when \(N(t) \geq 1000\).

1. Set up the equation:

\[
10 \cdot 2^{t/3} \geq 1000
\]

2. Divide through by 10:

\[
2^{t/3} \geq 100
\]

3. Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\frac{t}{3} \cdot \ln(2) \geq \ln(100)
\]

4. Solve for \(t\):

\[
t \geq 3 \cdot \frac{\ln(100)}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using approximations \(\ln(100) \approx 4.605\) and \(\ln(2) \approx 0.693\):

\[
t \geq 3 \cdot \frac{4.605}{0.693} \approx 19.93 \, \text{days}
\]

Thus, approximately 19.93 days after January 1st, the number of infected people reaches 1,000.

Next, convert 19.93 days into a date:

- January has 31 days, so January 1st is day 0.
- Adding 19 days to January 1st brings us to January 20th.
- The remaining 0.93 days corresponds to about 22 hours, meaning the infection reaches 1,000 people on January 21st.

To confirm, we track the growth in 3-day intervals:

- January 1 (Day 0): 10
- January 4 (Day 3): 20
- January 7 (Day 6): 40
- January 10 (Day 9): 80
- January 13 (Day 12): 160
- January 16 (Day 15): 320
- January 19 (Day 18): 640
- January 22 (Day 21): 1280

By January 19th (Day 18), 640 people are infected. The next doubling occurs by January 22nd (Day 21), when the number reaches 1280. However, the infection surpasses 1,000 people before January 22nd. Using the continuous growth model, the infection reaches 1,000 people on January 21st.

Thus, the earliest date when the entire town is infected is **January 21st**.
