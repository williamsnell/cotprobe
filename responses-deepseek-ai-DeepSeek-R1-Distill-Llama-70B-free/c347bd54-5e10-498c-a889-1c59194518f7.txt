Okay, so I have this problem about depreciation cost per mile for a truck. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

John's-Rent-A-Truck bought a van for $4,500. The truck is expected to last 100,000 miles and then have a trade-in value of $500. I need to find the cost of depreciation per mile.

Hmm, depreciation is basically the decrease in value of the asset over its useful life. So, I think I need to calculate the total depreciation first and then divide that by the total miles to get the cost per mile.

The formula for depreciation might be something like (Purchase Price - Salvage Value) divided by useful life. Oh right, that's straight-line depreciation. So, the salvage value here is the trade-in value, which is $500.

So, the total depreciation would be $4,500 minus $500, which equals $4,000. That makes sense because after 100,000 miles, the van is worth $500, so it's lost $4,000 in value.

Now, to find the depreciation per mile, I take that $4,000 and divide it by the total miles, which is 100,000. Let me do the math: 4000 divided by 100,000. Well, 4000 divided by 100,000 is 0.04. So, $0.04 per mile.

Wait, let me double-check. 100,000 miles is a big number, so the per-mile cost should be a small number. 4000 divided by 100,000 is indeed 0.04. So the cost is 4 cents per mile.

Looking at the options, option J is $0.04 per mile. So the answer should be J.

To calculate the cost of depreciation per mile for John's-Rent-A-Truck, we first determine the total depreciation by subtracting the salvage value from the purchase price:  
**Total Depreciation = $4,500 - $500 = $4,000.**  

Next, we divide the total depreciation by the expected useful life of the truck in miles:  
**Depreciation per Mile = $4,000 รท 100,000 = $0.04 per mile.**  

Thus, the cost of depreciation per mile is **$0.04**, which corresponds to option **J**.
