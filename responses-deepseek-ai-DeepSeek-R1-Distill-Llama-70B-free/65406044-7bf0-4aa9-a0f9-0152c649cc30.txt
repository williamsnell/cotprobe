Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, there are three particles on the x-axis. Particle 1 has a charge of +q, particle 2 is +4q, and particle 3 has an unknown charge q3. They're placed at certain points, and I need to find where particle 3 should be so that all three stay in place when released. So, essentially, the net force on each particle should be zero.

Wait, but how? Because each particle exerts forces on the others. Since all are charges, the forces are electrical. Since they're at rest, the forces must balance out.

Hmm. Let me visualize this. Particles 1 and 2 are fixed? Or are all three free to move? Oh, the problem says when released, they remain in place. So, they must each experience zero net force.

Wait, but if they're released and remain in place, that implies the forces acting on each are balanced. So each particle feels forces from the other two, and those forces must cancel out for each.

I think I need to consider the forces on each particle.

Let me denote the positions. Let's say particle 1 is at some point x1, particle 2 at x2, and particle 3 at x3. From the problem, it seems that particles 1 and 2 are fixed at certain positions, and I need to find where particle 3 should be placed so that all three are in equilibrium.

Wait, the problem says particle 1 and 2 are held at a separation of L = 9.00 cm on the x-axis. So, maybe particle 1 is at x=0 and particle 2 is at x=9 cm? Or maybe they're placed at some other positions, but the separation is 9 cm. But the exact initial positions aren't given. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says particles 1 and 2 are held at separation L=9 cm. So perhaps particle 1 is at some point, and particle 2 is 9 cm apart from it. But without loss of generality, perhaps I can place them at x=0 and x=9 cm. Let's assume that for simplicity.

So, particle 1: x1 = 0 cm, charge +q.

Particle 2: x2 = 9 cm, charge +4q.

Particle 3 is somewhere on the x-axis, at x3, charge q3.

Now, the setup after release must have each particle in equilibrium. So, for each particle, the net force must be zero.

Wait, but particle 3 is a charge that we can choose; we're to find its position such that the system is in equilibrium. Alternatively, maybe only the net force on particle 3 is zero, but that doesn't seem right because all particles are supposed to remain in place.

Wait no, the problem states that the three particles remain in place when released. So each must experience zero net force.

Wait, but particles 1 and 2 are fixed in place? Or are they free to move as well? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read again.

"If particle 3 of charge q3 is to be located such that the three particles remain in place when released..."

Ah, so when released, they stay in their positions. So each particle must be in a position where the net force on it is zero. Because if there were a net force, they would accelerate, and thus not remain in place.

So, for each particle, the forces from the other two charges must balance.

Therefore, I need to set up equations for each particle where the net force is zero.

Let's start with particle 1.

The forces on particle 1 are from particle 2 and particle 3.

Similarly, the forces on particle 2 are from particle 1 and particle 3.

And the forces on particle 3 are from particle 1 and 2.

Wait, but this could get complicated because each force depends on the positions and charges of the others.

But perhaps there's a symmetry or a way to find the position of particle 3 that makes everything balance.

Alternatively, perhaps particle 3 is placed between 1 and 2, or outside of them.

Wait, let's think about the forces.

Since particles 1 and 2 are both positively charged, they repel each other. But when particle 3 is introduced, it's going to exert forces on both, and vice versa. For the system to be in equilibrium, the forces must balance.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the position of particle 3, not its charge. Wait, no, I'm being asked for the x-coordinate of particle 3. Oh, right, the question is about where to place it.

Wait, but what about the charges? Oh, no, we don't know the charge of particle 3. But the question is only about the position, so perhaps the charge is determined by the position.

Wait, but the question is only asking for the x-coordinate. Hmm. Let me read the question again.

"In Fig. 21-26, particle 1 of charge +q and particle 2 of charge +4.00 q are held at separation L=9.00 cm on an x axis. If particle 3 of charge q3 is to be located such that the three particles remain in place when released, what must be the x coordinate of particle 3?"

Oh, so we're to find x3, the position, not q3. So, perhaps the charge q3 can be determined, but the position is what's being asked.

Wait, but to find x3, perhaps the system must have each particle in equilibrium. So, for each, the net electric force must be zero.

But this seems like a system of equations. Let me try to outline the forces.

First, let's denote:

- x1 = 0 cm (position of particle 1)
- x2 = 9 cm (position of particle 2)
- x3 = ? (position of particle 3, which we need to find)

Forces on particle 1:

The forces from particle 2 and particle 3.

F12 is the force on 1 due to 2. Since both are positive, it's a repulsion. So F12 is directed to the left (since particle 2 is at x=9, particle 1 feels a force to the left).

Similarly, F13 is the force on 1 due to 3. Depending on where 3 is, this could be to the left or right.

Wait, but since all particles are positive (if q3 is positive), then the forces would be repulsive. But if q3 is negative, the forces could be attractive.

Wait, but we don't know the sign of q3 yet. Hmm, but perhaps from the setup, we can figure it out.

Wait, but the problem doesn't state whether particle 3 is positive or negative. So maybe that's something we can determine.

But let's think about the net force on each particle.

For particle 1 to stay in place, the net force must be zero. So F12 (force from 2) + F13 (force from 3) = 0.

Similarly for particle 2: F21 (force from 1) + F23 (force from 3) = 0.

And for particle 3: F31 (force from 1) + F32 (force from 2) = 0.

But this seems like a lot of equations. But perhaps the symmetry can help.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to consider that the net force on particle 3 must be zero. Alternatively, perhaps the forces on 1 and 2 must also be zero.

Wait, but the way the problem is phrased, all three particles will remain in place, so all must experience zero net force.

Alternatively, perhaps particles 1 and 2 are fixed in place, and only particle 3 is free to move. But the question is a bit unclear. But I think the intended setup is that all three particles are free, and each experiences zero net force.

So, let's proceed with that.

So, for particle 1:

F12 (force from 2 on 1) + F13 (force from 3 on 1) = 0.

Similarly, for particle 2:

F21 (force from 1 on 2) + F23 (force from 3 on 2) = 0.

And for particle 3:

F31 (force from 1 on 3) + F32 (force from 2 on 3) = 0.

Wait, but since the forces are between pairs, F12 = -F21, etc.

Let me write the equations with Coulomb's law.

The force between two point charges is F = k * |q1*q2| / rÂ², and the direction depends on the signs.

Since particle 1 is at x=0, particle 2 at x=9 cm, and particle 3 at x3.

Let's define the positions:

x1 = 0,

x2 = 9 cm,

x3 = ? Let's say it's at x = x, which could be anywhere on the x-axis.

Now, let's write the net force on each particle.

For particle 1 (at x=0):

The forces are from 2 and 3.

Force from 2 on 1: F12.

Since 2 is at x=9 cm, the distance between 1 and 2 is 9 cm. Both charges are positive, so the force on 1 is to the left (negative x direction).

F12 = k * (q * 4q) / (0.09 m)^2, direction to the left.

Similarly, the force from 3 on 1, F13: depends on where 3 is.

If 3 is to the right of 1 (x>0), then the force from 3 on 1 could be to the right (if q3 is negative) or to the left (if q3 is positive).

Wait, but the charges of 1 and 3 would determine the direction.

Wait, but the net force on 1 must be zero, so F12 + F13 = 0.

So F13 must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to F12.

So F13 must be to the right, which would mean that particle 3 is attracting particle 1. Since particle 1 is positive, particle 3 must have a negative charge to cause an attractive force.

So, q3 is negative.

Wait, that's a key point. So particle 3 must be negative because it needs to attract particle 1 to balance the repulsion from particle 2.

Now, let's write the equations.

For particle 1:

F12 (to the left) + F13 (to the right) = 0.

So F13 = -F12.

Similarly, for particle 2:

The forces from 1 and 3.

F21 (to the right, since 1 is at 0 and 2 is at 9 cm, and both positive) plus F23 (which could be to the left or right, depending on where 3 is and its charge).

But since particle 2 must have zero net force, F21 + F23 = 0.

So F23 must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to F21.

But F21 is equal to F12, because F21 = F12 in magnitude (Newton's third law). So F23 must be equal to F12.

Wait, but F23 is the force on 2 due to 3. So for F23 to be equal and opposite, let's think about the direction.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write expressions.

Let me proceed step by step.

1. For particle 1:

F12 is the force from 2 on 1: k*(q)(4q)/(0.09)^2, direction to the left (negative x-direction).

F13 is the force from 3 on 1: k*(q)(q3)/(d1)^2, where d1 is the distance between 1 and 3.

The direction of F13 depends on the sign of q3. If q3 is negative, F13 is to the right (positive direction), which would cancel F12.

So equation for particle 1:

F12 (left) + F13 (right) = 0.

So, k*q*(4q)/(0.09)^2 * (-i) + [k*q*q3/(d1)^2] * (+i) = 0.

The i-components sum to zero.

So,

k*q*(4q)/(0.09)^2 = k*q*|q3|/(d1)^2.

Wait, but since q3 is negative, the force from 3 on 1 is to the right, which is a positive direction, so the equation would have the terms with opposite signs.

Wait, wait, the direction matters. Let me clarify.

Let me write the magnitudes.

The magnitude of F12 is (k * q *4q)/(0.09)^2.

The magnitude of F13 must be equal to F12 for the net force on 1 to be zero.

So,

k * q * |q3| / (d1)^2 = k * q *4 q / (0.09)^2.

We can cancel k and q from both sides.

|q3| / (d1)^2 = 4 q^2 / (0.09)^2.

So,

|q3| = [4 q^2 (d1)^2 ] / (0.09)^2.

But I don't know d1, which is the distance between 1 and 3. d1 = |x3 - 0| = |x3| cm, but let's convert to meters: d1 = |x3| * 0.01 m.

Wait, but I don't know x3 yet. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write similar equations for particle 2 and see if I can find a relation.

For particle 2, the forces are F21 and F23.

F21 is the force from 1 on 2, which is to the right (since 1 and 2 are positive, so repulsion). The magnitude is same as F12: (k * q *4q)/(0.09)^2.

F23 is the force from 3 on 2. Its direction depends on where 3 is located and the sign of q3.

But since q3 is negative, and particle 2 is positive, the force from 3 on 2 would be attractive. So if 3 is to the right of 2 (x>9 cm), then F23 would be to the left. If 3 is between 1 and 2 (0 <x3 <9), F23 would be to the right. If 3 is to the left of 1 (x3 <0), F23 would be to the right.

Wait, but considering that for particle 2 to have zero net force, F21 (to the right) + F23 (from 3) must equal zero. So F23 must be to the left with the same magnitude as F21.

Thus, F23 must be to the left, meaning the force from 3 on 2 is to the left. So, the particle 3 must be to the right of 2, because then the attractive force (since q3 is negative) would pull 2 towards 3, which is to the right. Wait, no, wait: if 3 is to the right of 2, then 2 would be attracted towards 3, which is to the right, so the force F23 on 2 would be to the right. But F21 is also to the right, so their sum can't be zero. That would mean F23 should be to the left, so that F21 (right) and F23 (left) can cancel.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

If q3 is negative, then 3 attracts 2. So the direction of F23 (force on 2 due to 3) depends on where 3 is located relative to 2.

If 3 is to the left of 2 (x3 <9 cm), then the force on 2 from 3 would be to the left (towards 3). That would mean F23 is to the left.

If 3 is to the right of 2, then the force on 2 from 3 would be to the right (towards 3), so F23 is to the right.

But for the net force on 2 to be zero, F21 (right) + F23 (left) =0. So F23 must be to the left, with magnitude equal to F21.

So, F23 must be to the left, which implies that 3 is to the left of 2, i.e., x3 <9 cm.

Wait, but earlier we thought that 3 must be to the right of 1, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps 3 is between 1 and 2.

Wait, but let's proceed.

So, for particle 2:

F21 (to the right) + F23 (to the left) = 0.

So,

F21 = F23.

The magnitudes must be equal.

So,

k*(4q)*q/(0.09)^2 = k*(4q)*|q3|/(d2)^2,

where d2 is the distance between 2 and 3.

Wait, because the force on 2 due to 3 is F23 = k*(4q * |q3|)/(d2)^2, and it's directed to the left, as required.

So,

From particle 1: |q3| = [4 q^2 (d1)^2 ] / (0.09)^2.

From particle 2: |q3| = [ (4q * q) (d2)^2 ] / ( (4q) * 0.09^2 ) )? Wait, maybe I should write the equations again.

Wait, for particle 2:

F21 = k*(q)(4q)/(0.09)^2 to the right.

F23 = k*(4q)(|q3|)/(d2)^2 to the left.

So,

F21 = F23,

so,

k*q*4q/(0.09)^2 = k*4q*|q3|/(d2)^2.

Cancel terms:

q*4q/(0.09)^2 = 4q*|q3|/(d2)^2.

Divide both sides by 4q:

q/(0.09)^2 = |q3|/(d2)^2.

So,

|q3| = q * (d2)^2 / (0.09)^2.

Now, from particle 1's equation:

|q3| = [4 q^2 (d1)^2 ] / (0.09)^2.

So, setting the two expressions for |q3| equal:

q * (d2)^2 / (0.09)^2 = [4 q^2 (d1)^2 ] / (0.09)^
