Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with gas laws and molecular weight calculations. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem says: An 11-liter flask contains 20 grams of neon and an unknown weight of hydrogen. The gas density is found to be 0.002 g/cc at 0°C. I need to find the average molecular weight, the grams of hydrogen present, and the pressure. The options are given from A to J.

First, I remember that density is mass over volume. Oh wait, wait, but here they give the gas density as 0.002 g/cc. Wait, at 0°C, which is 273 K, and standard pressure is 1 atm, but wait, maybe that's not the case here. Hmm.

Wait, the density of a gas can be related to its molar mass using the ideal gas law. I think the formula is density (d) equals (PM)/(RT), where P is pressure, M is molar mass, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature. Oh right, because PV = nRT, and n is mass (m) divided by M. So density d = mass/volume = (n*M)/V = (PM)/(RT). So rearranged, M = (dRT)/P.

But wait, I might be mixing up something. Let me think again. Alternatively, I remember that for ideal gases, the density is (mass)/(volume) = (n*M)/(V) = (PM)/(RT), because n = m/M and m is the mass. So yes, d = (P M) / (R T). So M = (d R T) / P.

But wait, here we're given the density, but what about the pressure? Oh wait, the problem doesn't specify that it's at standard pressure. Hmm. Oh wait, but the problem says the density is given at 0°C, which is 273 K. But without knowing the pressure, how can I find the molecular weight? Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the flask is under standard pressure? Or maybe the pressure is the same as the surrounding, but I'm not told that. Oh wait, maybe the density is given under certain conditions, and perhaps we can assume standard temperature and pressure (STP), which is 0°C and 1 atm. Because at STP, certain gases have known densities.

Alternatively, perhaps more accurately, if the temperature is 0°C (273 K), but the pressure isn't given, but since the gas is in the flask, perhaps the pressure is such that the density is as given. Wait, I think I need to approach this differently.

Wait, the problem gives the density, and the temperature. So perhaps I can find the molar mass of the mixture using the density formula. Because the gases are neon and hydrogen, so the average molar mass would be based on their mole fractions.

Wait, let me outline the steps I think I need to take.

1. Find the average molar mass of the gas mixture using the density and temperature provided.
2. Use the masses of neon and hydrogen to find their moles and then the mole fractions to compute the average molar mass.
3. Set the two expressions for average molar mass equal and solve for the unknown mass of hydrogen.
4. Once the mass of hydrogen is known, calculate the total pressure using the ideal gas law.

Let me start with step 1.

The formula I was thinking of earlier: d = (P M) / (R T)

Wait, but I need to make sure the units are consistent. Let's see:

Density d is given as 0.002 g/cm³. Let's convert that to kg/m³ for SI units. Wait, 1 g/cm³ is 1000 kg/m³, so 0.002 g/cm³ is 2 kg/m³. Wait, wait: 0.002 g/cm³ = 0.002 * 1000 kg/m³ = 2 kg/m³. Wait no, wait. 1 g is 0.001 kg, and 1 cm³ is 1e-6 m³. So 0.002 g/cm³ equals 0.002 * 0.001 kg / (1e-6 m³) ) = 0.002 * 0.001 / 1e-6 = 0.002 * 1000 kg/m³ = 2 kg/m³. Hmm, okay, that's right.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to use units that match the gas constant R. I think R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K, and when using R as 0.0821, pressure should be in atm, volume in liters, etc.

But wait, the density is given in g/cm³. Let's see: 1 g/cm³ is 1000 kg/m³, but perhaps another approach is better.

Wait, alternatively, since the gas is at 0°C (273 K), and we can use R = 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K. Let me write the formula again:

d = (P M) / (R T)

We can solve for M: M = (d R T) / P

But wait, I don't know the pressure P yet. Hmm. Unless the pressure is 1 atm, but I don't think that's stated. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the pressure inside the flask is the same as the atmospheric pressure, but that's an assumption. The problem doesn't say it's open, so maybe it's under some pressure. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, maybe the given density is the density under the conditions inside the flask, which has volume 11 L. So perhaps we can find the total mass, and then find the average molar mass.

Wait, the density is 0.002 g/cm³. Let me compute the total mass of the gas in the flask.

The volume is 11 L. Let me convert that to cm³ because density is in g/cm³. 1 L is 1000 cm³, so 11 L is 11,000 cm³.

Mass of gas = density * volume = 0.002 g/cm³ * 11,000 cm³ = 22 grams. Oh, that makes sense.

So the total mass of the gas is 22 grams. Because the flask contains neon and hydrogen, and the mass of neon is 20 grams, the mass of hydrogen must be 22 - 20 = 2 grams. Oh wait, that's a key point!

Wait, let me verify: total mass is d * V = 0.002 g/cm³ * 11,000 cm³ = 22 g. So if the flask has 20g of neon, then hydrogen must be 2 grams. Because 20 + H_mass = 22 → H_mass = 2 grams.

Wait, that seems straightforward. So the mass of hydrogen is 2 grams. Let me check the options. Option G and I have 2.5 grams, option G says 2 grams. Wait, looking back, option G says 2 grams of H, 11 g/mol, 4.07 atm. Hmm.

Wait, but this is just based on the total mass. So then, the average molecular weight can be found from the molar masses of the components.

So, the next step is to find the average molecular weight (M_avg) of the gas mixture.

M_avg is calculated as (total mass) / (total moles).

Total mass is 22 grams. Now, moles of each gas:

Neon is 20 grams. Its molar mass is given as 20 g/mol, so moles of Ne = 20 g / 20 g/mol = 1 mole.

Hydrogen is 2 grams. Its molar mass is about 2 g/mol (H2 is 2.016 g/mol, but I'll approximate as 2). So moles of H2 = 2 g / 2 g/mol = 1 mole.

So total moles = 1 + 1 = 2 moles.

Thus, average molecular weight M_avg = total mass / total moles = 22 g / 2 mol = 11 g/mol.

So M_avg is 11 g/mol.

Looking at the options, option G says 11 g/mol, which matches. Let's see what other parameters are in option G: 2 grams of H, 11 g/mol, and 4.07 atm. So that seems promising.

Now, the third part is to find the pressure. Using the ideal gas law: PV = nRT.

We have:

P = ?
V = 11 L
n = total moles = 2 mol
R = 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K
T = 0°C = 273 K

So, P = (n R T) / V = (2 mol * 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K * 273 K) / 11 L

Let me compute that.

First, 2 * 0.0821 = 0.1642

0.1642 * 273 ≈ Let's compute that:

0.1642 * 200 = 32.84

0.1642 *73 ≈ 12.0 (approx more accurately: 0.1642 *70 = 11.494; 0.1642*3=0.4926 → total 11.9866)

So total ≈32.84 +11.9866 ≈44.8266

Then, 44.8266 / 11 ≈4.0751 atm. So approximately 4.08 atm. The option G says 4.07 atm, which is close, considering rounding during calculation.

So, putting it all together:

Mass of H: 2 grams

Average M: 11 g/mol

Pressure: approx 4.07 atm.

Which matches option G.

To solve the problem, we start by calculating the total mass of the gas mixture using the given density and volume of the flask. The density is 0.002 g/cm³, and the volume is 11 L, which is equivalent to 11,000 cm³. The total mass of the gas is:

\[
\text{Mass of gas} = \text{density} \times \text{volume} = 0.002 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \times 11,000 \, \text{cm}^3 = 22 \, \text{g}.
\]

The flask contains 20 g of neon, so the mass of hydrogen is:

\[
\text{Mass of hydrogen} = \text{total mass} - \text{mass of neon} = 22 \, \text{g} - 20 \, \text{g} = 2 \, \text{g}.
\]

Next, we calculate the average molecular weight (\(M_{\text{avg}}\)) of the gas mixture. The total mass is 22 g, and the total moles of gas are the sum of the moles of neon and hydrogen. Neon has a molar mass of 20 g/mol, so:

\[
\text{Moles of neon} = \frac{\text{mass of neon}}{\text{molar mass of neon}} = \frac{20 \, \text{g}}{20 \, \text{g/mol}} = 1 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Hydrogen has a molar mass of approximately 2 g/mol, so:

\[
\text{Moles of hydrogen} = \frac{\text{mass of hydrogen}}{\text{molar mass of hydrogen}} = \frac{2 \, \text{g}}{2 \, \text{g/mol}} = 1 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total moles of gas are:

\[
\text{Total moles} = \text{moles of neon} + \text{moles of hydrogen} = 1 \, \text{mol} + 1 \, \text{mol} = 2 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The average molecular weight is then:

\[
M_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\text{total mass}}{\text{total moles}} = \frac{22 \, \text{g}}{2 \, \text{mol}} = 11 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

Finally, we calculate the pressure using the ideal gas law:

\[
PV = nRT \quad \Rightarrow \quad P = \frac{nRT}{V}.
\]

Here, \(n = 2 \, \text{mol}\), \(R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)}\), \(T = 273 \, \text{K}\), and \(V = 11 \, \text{L}\). Substituting:

\[
P = \frac{(2 \, \text{mol})(0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)})(273 \, \text{K})}{11 \, \text{L}}.
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
2 \times 0.0821 \times 273 = 44.8266.
\]

Then, divide by 11:

\[
P = \frac{44.8266}{11} \approx 4.07 \, \text{atm}.
\]

Thus, the mass of hydrogen is 2 g, the average molecular weight is 11 g/mol, and the pressure is approximately 4.07 atm. These values match the parameters given in option G.
