Question:

A heavy object can sink into the ground during an earthquake if the shaking causes the ground to undergo liquefaction, in which the soil grains experience little friction as they slide over one another. The ground is then effectively quicksand. The possibility of liquefaction in sandy ground can be predicted in terms of the void ratio $e$ for a sample of the ground:
$$
e=\frac{V_{\text {voids }}}{V_{\text {grains }}} .
$$
Here, $V_{\text {grains }}$ is the total volume of the sand grains in the sample and $V_{\text {voids }}$ is the total volume between the grains (in the voids). If $e$ exceeds a critical value of 0.80 , liquefaction can occur during an earthquake. What is the corresponding sand density $\rho_{\text {sand }}$ ? Solid silicon dioxide (the primary component of sand) has a density of $\rho_{\mathrm{SiO}_2}=2.600 \times 10^3 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^3$.

Options:

A: 1.4 $10^3 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^3$
B: 1.2 $10^3 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^3$
C: 3.0 $10^3 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^3$
D: 1.6 $10^3 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^3$
E: 2.4 $10^3 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^3$
F: 1.8 $10^3 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^3$
G: 2.8 $10^3 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^3$
H: 2.2 $10^3 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^3$
I: 1.0 $10^3 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^3$
J: 2.6 $10^3 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^3$

Okay, so I have this physics problem about soil liquefaction during an earthquake. Hmm, I remember that liquefaction happens when the ground shakes so much that the soil grains lose friction and start behaving like a liquid. The question is about the void ratio and the corresponding sand density when the void ratio exceeds a critical value.

Alright, let's read the problem again. The void ratio e is given by e = V_voids / V_grains. If e is above 0.80, liquefaction can occur. I need to find the sand density when e is at this critical point.

Wait, the sand is made of silicon dioxide, and its density is 2600 kg/m³. So solid SiO₂ has that density, but when it's in the form of sand, the density will be lower because of the voids between the grains.

So, sand's overall density ρ_sand would depend on how much of the volume is occupied by the grains versus the voids. Let me think about how to relate the void ratio to density.

The total volume of the sand sample would be V_total = V_grains + V_voids. The mass of the sand is just the mass of the grains, which is (V_grains) * (density of SiO₂) because the voids are just empty space (or air, which I guess we can ignore in terms of mass).

So, the density of the sand, ρ_sand, is mass divided by total volume. Mass is V_grains * ρ_SiO2. Total volume is V_grains + V_voids.

Putting that together: ρ_sand = (V_grains * ρ_SiO2) / (V_grains + V_voids).

But wait, the void ratio e is V_voids / V_grains. So V_voids = e * V_grains.

Substituting that into the equation: ρ_sand = (V_grains * ρ_SiO2) / (V_grains + e V_grains) = (ρ_SiO2) / (1 + e).

Ah, okay, that simplifies things. So ρ_sand = ρ_SiO2 / (1 + e).

Given that e is 0.80, let's plug in the numbers. ρ_SiO2 is 2600 kg/m³.

So ρ_sand = 2600 / (1 + 0.80) = 2600 / 1.8.

Let me do that division. 2600 divided by 1.8. Hmm, 1.8 times 1444 is 2600? Wait, 1.8 * 1444 = let's see. 1.8 * 1400 = 2520, and 1.8 *44=79.2, so 2520+79.2=2599.2. Close enough. So 1444 is approximately the result.

Wait, wait, 2600/1.8 = (26000 / 18) = let's compute that. 18 * 1444 = 25992, as I thought. So 26000/18 is approximately 1444.44 kg/m³.

Looking at the options, option E is 2.4e3 kg/m³ which is 2400, which is lower than 1444? Wait, no, 1444 is 1.444e3. Hmm, but wait, the options don't have 1.444e3. Wait, maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, the options are A:1.4e3, B:1.2e3,... E is 2.4e3, F is 1.8e3, etc. So 1444 kg/m³ is 1.444e3, which would be closest to option A:1.4e3. But wait, let me double-check the formula.

Wait, the formula I derived was ρ_sand = ρ_SiO2 / (1 + e). So when e is 0.8, 1+e is 1.8, so 2600 / 1.8 = approx 1444 kg/m³, which is 1.444e3. So the closest option is A:1.4e3. But let me look again at the options.

Wait, the options: option A is 1.4e3, which is 1400. But my calculation is 1444, which is closer to 1.4e3 than 1.5e3 (which isn't even an option). So perhaps the intended answer is 1444 kg/m³, but the options don't have that exact value. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should express the density in terms of the void ratio correctly. Let me rederive.

The void ratio e is V_voids / V_grains. So if I have V_grains = V, then V_voids = e*V. The total volume is V + eV = V(1+e).

The mass of the sand is the mass of the grains, which is V * ρ_SiO2. So density is mass/total volume: (V * ρ_SiO2) / (V (1 + e)) ) = ρ_SiO2 / (1 + e). That's correct.

So when e=0.8, 1+e=1.8. 2600 /1.8 = 1444.44 kg/m³.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.4e3 (1400), which is less than 1444. Option D is 1.6e3, which is 1600. Hmmm, but 1444 is closer to 1400 than 1600, but perhaps in the context, the options are rounded. Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait 1.8 * 1444 = 2599.2, as before. 1.8 * 1444.44 = 2600 exactly. So 1444.44 kg/m³ is the exact value. So the options don't have this; the closest is option A at 1400, but that's 44 kg/m³ less than the calculated value.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the void ratio formula. Let me think again. Another approach: perhaps the bulk density formula is (1 + e) * density of grains? No, wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, wait another thought. Maybe I should consider the relationship between the void ratio and the porosity. Porosity n is V_voids/(V_total). So n = e/(1 + e). But in terms of density, ρ_sand = ρ_grain * (1 - n), because n is the fraction of voids. So, since n = e/(1+e), then 1 - n = 1/(1+e). So ρ_sand = ρ_grain * (1/(1+e)), which matches what I had earlier.

So no, I think the calculation is correct. So the answer should be approximately 1444 kg/m³, which is 1.444e3 kg/m³. But none of the options match exactly. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A:1.4e3

B:1.2e3

C:3.0e3

D:1.6e3

E:2.4e3

F:1.8e3

G:2.8e3

H:2.2e3

I:1.0e3

J:2.6e3

So 1.444e3 is not present. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for when e is 0.8, which is the threshold. So perhaps the calculation leads to 1444 kg/m³, but the options don't have that exact value. Alternatively, maybe the calculation is done with e=0.8, but perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, let me compute 2600 /1.8 again. 1.8 goes into 2600 how many times?

1.8 * 1000 = 1800

1.8 * 1400 = 2520

2600-2520=80

1.8 * 44 = 79.2

So 1400 +44= 1444, with 0.8 left (80 -79.2=0.8). So 0.8/(1.8)= approx 0.444. So 1444.444 kg/m³.

Hmm, perhaps the intended answer is 1.4e3, option A, but that's 1400. Alternatively, maybe the question expects me to round differently. Wait, perhaps I should think of the reciprocal.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is actually ρ_sand = ρ_SiO2 * (V_grains / V_total) ) = ρ_SiO2 * (1/(1 + e)).

Wait, yes, that's what I did. So maybe the options are expecting it in terms of 2.6e3 divided by 1.8, which is 1444, but the options don't have that, so perhaps the intended choice is not present. But that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. Maybe I should consider that the density is (1 + e) times the grain density? No, that doesn't make sense because higher e would lower the density.

Wait, another approach. Let me think in terms of mass and volume.

Suppose the total volume is V. Then V_grains is (V * (1)) / (1 + e), because V_grains = V_total * (1/(1+e)).

Because V_grains = V_total * (1/(1+e)).

Then, the mass is V_grains * ρ_SiO2 = (V/(1+e)) * 2600.

So density is mass / V_total = (2600/(1+e)) kg/m³.

So when e=0.8, it's 2600/1.8 ≈1444 kg/m³.

Hmm, so the correct answer is approximately 1444 kg/m³, which is 1.444e3. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is inverted. Maybe the sand density is (V_grains / V_total) times ρ_SiO2.

Wait, V_grains is the volume of grains. So (V_grains) / (V_total) = 1/(1+e). So yes, same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the relative density or something else. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another way to think about it: the void ratio e is 0.8, so V_voids = 0.8 V_grains.

So total volume V = V_grains + V_voids = V_grains (1 + 0.8) = 1.8 V_grains.

Mass of sand is mass of grains: m = V_grains * ρ_SiO2.

Density ρ_sand = m / V = (V_grains * ρ_SiO2) / (1.8 V_grains) ) = ρ_SiO2 / 1.8.

So again, same result, 2600/1.8=1444 kg/m³.

Hmm, the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look again at the problem statement.

Wait, the question says "the corresponding sand density" when e exceeds 0.80, so when e=0.80. So the calculation is correct.

Looking at the options, perhaps the intended answer is option A, 1.4e3, but why is that? Wait, 1444 is about 1.444e3, which is closer to 1.4e3 (1400) than to 1.6e3 (1600). So perhaps option A is the intended choice.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to use e = V_voids / V_total, which would be a different approach, but that's not the definition of void ratio. Because the void ratio is V_voids / V_grains.

Wait, if someone mistakenly took e as V_voids / V_total, then e would be (V_voids)/(V_grains + V_voids) = e/(1+e), with e being the actual void ratio. But that's not the case here.

No, the problem clearly defines e as V_voids / V_grains, so the approach is correct.

So, perhaps the answer is not among the options, but that's impossible. Looking again, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 2600 divided by 1.8. Let me compute it more accurately.

1.8 times 1444 is 2599.2, which is approximately 2600, so 1444.44 kg/m³.

Hmm, perhaps the options expect me to compute it as 2600 / (1 + 0.8) = 2600/1.8 = 1444 kg/m³. So the correct answer should be 1.444e3 kg/m³, but that's not an option. Wait, perhaps I'm looking at the options incorrectly.

Looking again, the options are:

A:1.4 ×10³ → 1400

B:1.2 ×10³ → 1200

C:3.0 ×10³ → 3000

D:1.6 ×10³ →1600

E:2.4 ×10³ →2400

F:1.8 ×10³ →1800

G:2.8 ×10³ →2800

H:2.2 ×10³ →2200

I:1.0 ×10³ →1000

J:2.6 ×10³ →2600

Wait, none of these are 1444. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the formula is the other way around. Let me think: if e is the void ratio, then the porosity n is e/(1+e). The density would be (1 - n) * ρ_grain.

So, 1 - n = 1/(1 + e). So same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the sand density is the product of the grain density and (1 + e). No, that would make it higher, which doesn't make sense because higher e (more voids) should lower the density.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the density relative to water or something else. But the question clearly states that the density is ρ_sand, which is what we're calculating.

Wait, maybe I should invert the formula. Suppose ρ_sand = ρ_grain * (V_grains / (V_grains + V_voids)), which is the same as before.

Hmm, I'm stuck. My calculation gives 1444 kg/m³, but the options don't have that. Unless I made a mistake in the initial formula.

Wait, perhaps the void ratio is e = V_voids / V_grains, so if e=0.8, V_voids = 0.8 V_grains. So the total volume is V_grains (1 + 0.8) = 1.8 V_grains.

So, the mass is V_grains * 2600 kg/m³.

So density is (V_grains * 2600) / (1.8 V_grains) ) = 2600 / 1.8 = 1444 kg/m³.

So the correct answer is 1.444e3 kg/m³, which isn't among the options. But looking back, perhaps I should check if the question specifies the density in terms of the critical value, perhaps it's when the void ratio equals 0.8, which is the threshold. So perhaps the calculation is correct, but the options don't have it. But that can't be, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I read the question incorrectly. The question says that if e exceeds 0.80, liquefaction occurs. So when e is 0.80, it's the threshold. So the calculation is correct for e=0.80.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the options again. Oh wait, option A is 1.4e3, which is 1400, and option F is 1.8e3, which is 1800. Hmm, my calculation is 1444, which is between 1400 and 1600. So perhaps the closest is option A, but it's not very close. Alternatively, perhaps the options are expecting an exact value when e=0.8, but perhaps I should compute 2600/(0.8 +1) =2600/1.8= 1444.44 kg/m³. So perhaps the intended answer is 1.444e3, but since that isn't present, perhaps the question expects option E, 2.4e3, which is higher than SiO2's density, which doesn't make sense. So that can't be.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the question is about the dry density, which is mass of solids divided by total volume. So, same as what I calculated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different formula. Wait, perhaps the relative density is involved. Or maybe the formula is inverted.

Wait, perhaps if the void ratio is e, then the sand's density is (1/(1 + e)) * ρ_SiO2. Which is exactly what I did.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is asking for the density in g/cm³, but no, the units in the options are kg/m³.

Hmm, perhaps the intended answer is option A, 1.4e3, but that would require 2600/(1.8) to be approximately 1444, which is close to 1400. But perhaps the options are rounded, so 1444 would round to 1.4e3. Or perhaps the options have a typo, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the critical void ratio as e=0.8, so maximum e before liquefaction is 0.8, and the sand density is when e=0.8, which is 1444 kg/m³, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 2600 divided by 1.8 again.

1.8 times 1.444 equals 2.6 (since 1.8 ×1=1.8, 1.8×0.4=0.72, 1.8×0.044≈0.0792; adding 1.8 +0.72=2.52 +0.0792≈2.6). So 1.8 × 1.444 ≈2.6. So 2600
