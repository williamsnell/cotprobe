Okay, so I've got this problem here about Reeves Corporation paying dividends. Hmm, I remember that dividends are payments made to shareholders, and they have preferred and common stock here. Let me think about what I know.

The company is paying a total dividend of $50,000 for the year. They have two types of stock: preferred and common. The preferred stock is 6%, $50 par value, and there are 1,000 shares outstanding. The common stock has 5,000 shares.

Wait, so I think the process is to calculate the dividend for each class first. For preferred stock, the dividend is usually calculated as a percentage of the par value. So for each share of preferred stock, it's 6% of $50. Let me compute that: 0.06 * 50 = $3 per share. So each preferred share gets $3.

Since there are 1,000 shares, the total preferred dividend would be 1,000 * $3 = $3,000. That leaves the rest for common stock, I guess. So the total dividend is $50,000, subtract the preferred part, which is $3,000. So 50,000 - 3,000 = $47,000 left for common.

Now, common stock dividends are usually based on what's left after paying preferred. So for each common share, it's the remaining $47,000 divided by the number of common shares, which is 5,000. 47,000 / 5,000 = $9.40 per share.

Wait, so the preferred is $3 per share and common is $9.40. Let me check the options. Looking at option J: $3 for preferred and $9.40 for common. Yeah, that matches. So the answer should be option J.

To determine the dividends per share for each class of stock, we start by calculating the dividend for the preferred stock. The preferred stock has a 6% dividend rate and a $50 par value. The dividend per share for preferred stock is:

\[
\text{Dividend per share (preferred)} = 0.06 \times 50 = \$3
\]

With 1,000 shares of preferred stock outstanding, the total dividend for preferred stock is:

\[
\text{Total preferred dividend} = 1,000 \times 3 = \$3,000
\]

The remaining dividend for common stock is the total dividend minus the preferred dividend:

\[
\text{Remaining for common stock} = 50,000 - 3,000 = \$47,000
\]

The common stock has 5,000 shares outstanding, so the dividend per share for common stock is:

\[
\text{Dividend per share (common)} = \frac{47,000}{5,000} = \$9.40
\]

Thus, the dividends per share are $3 for preferred stock and $9.40 for common stock. Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:

**J: $3 for preferred stock, $9.40 for common stock**
