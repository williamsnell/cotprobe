Okay, I need to solve this chemistry problem. It's about pH and hydrogen ion concentration. So there are two parts, A and B.

Part A says: Determine the pH of a solution with a hydrogen ion concentration of 3.5 × 10^-4. I remember that pH is calculated using the formula pH = -log[H+]. So I need to find the negative logarithm of 3.5e-4.

Let me think about logarithms. The log of 3.5 is about 0.544 because log(3)=0.477 and log(4)=0.602. So 3.5 is right in between, maybe around 0.544. But wait, the number is 3.5e-4, which is 3.5 × 10^-4. So the log is log(3.5) + log(1e-4). Log(1e-4) is -4 because 10^-4 is 0.0001.

So the log of 3.5e-4 is approximately 0.544 -4 = -3.456. Then pH is -log[H+], so pH = -(-3.456) = 3.456. Wait, but that's 3.456. Looking at the options, let me check each option's part A.

Option E: A) 3.54. Oh wait, 3.456 is approximately 3.46. So which option has A as ~3.46? Option A has 3.46, but let me look at the options.

Wait let me list the options:

Option A: A)3.46, B)5.6e-5.

Option B: A)4.16, B)6.9e-5.

Option C: A)4.54, B)7.6e-5.

Option D: A)3.16, B)5.1e-5.

Option E: A)3.54, B)5.0e-5.

Option F: A)2.96, B)4.4e-5.

Option G: A)3.24, B)3.5e-5.

Option H: A)2.46, B)4.6e-5.

Option I: A)4.46, B)6.6e-5.

Wait, so my calculation for part A was approximately 3.456, so 3.46. So part A's answer would be 3.46. Looking at the options, option A has A as 3.46, and option E has A as 3.54. So A's part A is correct.

Now part B: If a solution has a pH of 4.25, what is the hydrogen ion concentration? I recall that [H+] = 10^-pH. So pH is 4.25, so [H+] = 10^(-4.25).

Calculating 10^-4.25. Let's break it down. 10^-4 is 1e-4, which is 0.0001. 10^-0.25 is the same as 1/(10^0.25). What's 10^0.25? The square root of the square root of 10. Square root of 10 is about 3.16, so square root of 3.16 is about 1.778. So 10^0.25 is approximately 1.778. So 1/1.778 is about 0.562. So 10^-0.25 ≈ 0.562.

So 10^-4.25 is (10^-4) * (10^-0.25) = 1e-4 * 0.562 = 5.62e-5. So [H+] is approximately 5.62e-5 M.

Looking at the options for part B. Let's see which options have B as approximately 5.6e-5.

Option A: B)5.6e-5. That's exactly what I got. So part B's answer is 5.6e-5, which is option A's part B.

So for part A, the correct answer is 3.46 (option A's part A), and part B is 5.6e-5 (option A's part B). So the correct overall option is option A.

To solve the problem, we address each part systematically:

### Part A:
The pH is calculated using the formula:  
\[
\text{pH} = -\log[\text{H}^+]
\]  
Given \([\text{H}^+] = 3.5 \times 10^{-4}\), we calculate:  
\[
\log(3.5 \times 10^{-4}) = \log(3.5) + \log(10^{-4}) = 0.544 - 4 = -3.456
\]  
Thus,  
\[
\text{pH} = -(-3.456) = 3.456 \approx 3.46
\]  
From the options, **Option A** has the correct value for Part A: **3.46**.

### Part B:
The hydrogen ion concentration is calculated using the formula:  
\[
[\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}}
\]  
Given \(\text{pH} = 4.25\), we calculate:  
\[
[\text{H}^+] = 10^{-4.25} = 10^{-4} \times 10^{-0.25}
\]  
We know:  
\[
10^{-4} = 1 \times 10^{-4}, \quad 10^{-0.25} \approx 0.562
\]  
Thus,  
\[
[\text{H}^+] = (1 \times 10^{-4}) \times 0.562 = 5.62 \times 10^{-5} \approx 5.6 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{mol/L}
\]  
From the options, **Option A** has the correct value for Part B: **5.6 × 10⁻⁵**.

### Final Answer:
Both Part A and Part B are correctly answered by **Option A**.  

Answer: **A**
