Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about personnel selection and when it's appropriate to ask someone's age. Hmm, let's try to think this through.

The question is asking in what situation is it okay to ask a person's age during the hiring process. I remember that age can be a sensitive topic because of discrimination laws, like age discrimination. So I guess the key here is to figure out when asking about age is legally permissible.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Standardized test results show the incumbent doesn't have all the aptitudes expected for the job. Wait, so if the tests show they're lacking, does that relate to age? Maybe not directly. I think tests are supposed to assess ability, not age, so asking age here might not be appropriate. Probably not the right answer.

Option B: Age is a bona fide occupational requirement. Oh, right, bona fide occupational requirement (BFOR) is a term I remember. It means that certain job requirements are legitimate and necessary for the job. Like, maybe a role that requires a certain physical capability that's age-related. So if the job really needs someone of a certain age, it's okay to ask. This sounds like a valid reason.

Option C: Intelligence and personality tests suggest the person won't perform well. Wait, if tests indicate that, does that mean age is relevant? I don't think so. Intelligence and personality are separate from age. So asking age here wouldn't make sense and could be discriminatory.

Option D: The interviewer is curious. Curiosity isn't a valid reason. That's just personal interest and could lead to discrimination. Definitely not appropriate.

Option E: For company demographics and statistics. I'm not sure about this. Collecting demographic data might be done anonymously, but if they're asking during hiring, it could be problematic. Plus, it's not directly related to job requirements, so might not be allowed.

Option F: The incumbent is nearing retirement age. Hmm, if someone is close to retirement, maybe the company wants to know for planning. But I think asking about retirement plans or age could still be sensitive. Unless it's for pension or benefits purposes, but I'm not certain if that's a BFOR.

Option G: Company policy to hire only certain age groups. That sounds discriminatory. Policies based on age would likely violate laws unless there's a BFOR, which this option doesn't mention. So this is probably not correct.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be B. Because when age is a bona fide occupational requirement, it's legally acceptable to consider it. Other options either don't relate to job necessity or are based on inappropriate reasons.

The correct answer is B: age is a bona fide occupational requirement. This is the only situation where asking about age is appropriate, as it aligns with legal standards allowing age-related inquiries when necessary for the job. Other options involve inappropriate or discriminatory reasons for asking about age.

Answer: B
