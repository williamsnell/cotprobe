Okay, so I've got this insurance question to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Phil LeFranc purchased two types of insurance: bodily injury and property damage. The question is about calculating his premium for each type. The options are given from A to D, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, let's break down the information provided.

For bodily injury, he purchased (25/50) coverage. I think that's a split limit, meaning $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident. But I'm not entirely sure how that affects the premium calculation here. Then, the base premium for bodily injury is $101. The total factor for bodily injury is 1.37.

For property damage, he has $10,000 coverage. The base premium is $48, and the total factor is 1.10.

Wait, so I think the way to calculate the premium is to take the base premium and multiply it by the total factor. Because the total factor might include various adjustments like multipliers for coverage limits, discounts, or other factors.

So for each coverage type, the formula would be:

Premium = Base Premium * Total Factor

Let me test this approach.

Starting with bodily injury: base premium is $101, factor is 1.37.

So 101 * 1.37. Let me calculate that.

Hmm, 100 * 1.37 is 137, and 1 * 1.37 is 1.37, so total is 138.37. So that would be $138.37 for bodily injury.

Now for property damage: base is $48, factor is 1.10.

48 * 1.10 = 52.80. So that's $52.80.

Looking at the options, option C says $138.37 for bodily injury and $52.80 for property damage. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The question mentions he purchased (25/50) for bodily injury. Does that affect the calculation beyond the base premium? Or is the base premium already accounting for that coverage level?

I think the base premium is specific to the coverage amount. So if the base is $101 for (25/50), then the factor is applied on top. So yes, my calculation holds.

Let me just double-check the math:

101 * 1.37: 

Breaking it down, 100 * 1.37 is 137, and 1 * 1.37 is 1.37. Adding them gives 138.37.

48 * 1.1 is indeed 52.8.

Looking at the options again:

Option C: $138.37 and $52.80. Yep, that's what I got.

So the correct answer should be C.

The correct answer is determined by calculating the premium for each type of insurance coverage using the formula:

**Premium = Base Premium Ã— Total Factor**

### Bodily Injury Coverage:
- **Base Premium**: $101
- **Total Factor**: 1.37  
- **Calculation**:  
  \[
  101 \times 1.37 = 138.37
  \]
- **Premium**: $138.37

### Property Damage Coverage:
- **Base Premium**: $48
- **Total Factor**: 1.10  
- **Calculation**:  
  \[
  48 \times 1.10 = 52.80
  \]
- **Premium**: $52.80

### Matching with Options:
- Option **C** states: $138.37 for bodily injury coverage and $52.80 for property damage coverage, which matches the calculated values.

**Answer: C**
