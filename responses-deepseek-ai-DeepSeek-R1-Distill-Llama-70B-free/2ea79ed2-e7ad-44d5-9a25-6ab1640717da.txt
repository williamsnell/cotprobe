Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Addison's Disease. Hmm, I need to figure out which option is correct. Let me think through what I know about Addison's.

Addison's Disease is an endocrine disorder, right? It's related to the adrenal glands. I remember that the adrenal glands produce hormones like cortisol and aldosterone. So, if someone has Addison's, their adrenal glands aren't producing enough of these hormones. That makes sense because cortisol is a stress hormone and helps with metabolism, while aldosterone helps regulate sodium and potassium levels, which affects blood pressure.

Looking at the options now:

Option A: Results in frequent urination and thirst. Wait, isn't that more like diabetes symptoms? Because high blood sugar leads to more urination and thirst. Addison's might cause low blood pressure and dehydration, but I'm not sure if it directly causes frequent urination. Maybe not A.

Option B: Overactive thyroid. No, that's hyperthyroidism. Addison's is about adrenal insufficiency, so B is incorrect.

Option C: High cholesterol. I'm not sure. I think Addison's can cause changes in blood pressure and maybe electrolytes, but high cholesterol as a symptom? I don't recall that being a primary symptom. Maybe not C.

Option D: Recognized cause of hypertension. Wait, hypertension is high blood pressure. But I thought Addison's causes low blood pressure because of the lack of aldosterone, which helps regulate blood pressure. So D doesn't seem right.

Option E: Caused by excessive insulin. No, that's diabetes. Addison's is about adrenal hormones, not insulin. So E is wrong.

Option F: Affects the pituitary gland. No, the pituitary is a different gland. Addison's is about the adrenal glands, so F is incorrect.

Option G: A form of cancer affecting adrenal glands. No, Addison's is not cancer. It's an autoimmune disease or sometimes due to other causes, but not cancer. So G is wrong.

Option H: Diabetes is a complication. Hmm, not sure. Addison's and diabetes are different. Maybe in some cases, but I don't think it's a direct complication. Maybe not H.

Option I: Leads to generalized pigmentation. Oh right! One of the symptoms of Addison's is hyperpigmentation, where the skin darkens, especially in areas exposed to the sun or where friction occurs. So this sounds correct. I think I is a true statement.

Option J: Due to deficiency of prolactin. Prolactin is a hormone from the pituitary gland. Addison's is about adrenal hormones, so J is incorrect.

Wait, so looking back, the correct answer would be I, because it leads to generalized pigmentation changes. But let me think again about option A, because sometimes Addison's can cause dehydration, which might make someone thirsty. But frequent urination isn't a primary symptom. Maybe it's more about low blood volume and low blood pressure.

So I think the correct answer is I.

The correct answer is I. Addison's Disease is characterized by a deficiency of cortisol and aldosterone due to adrenal insufficiency. One of its hallmark symptoms is generalized pigmentation, which manifests as darkening of the skin, particularly in sun-exposed areas or regions subject to friction. This distinguishes it from other conditions such as diabetes or thyroid disorders. 

Answer: I
