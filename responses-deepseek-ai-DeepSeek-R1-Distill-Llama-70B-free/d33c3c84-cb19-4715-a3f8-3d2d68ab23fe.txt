Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about regression analysis, specifically concerning the R-squared value being zero. I'm a bit new to this topic, so I'll need to think through each part carefully.

The question gives four statements (i to iv) and asks which are true when R² is exactly zero. The options are various combinations of these statements.

First, I need to recall what R² represents. R-squared is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance of a dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable or variables in a regression model. So if R² is zero, that means the model explains none of the variance in y. 

Let me go through each statement one by one.

Statement i: All coefficient estimates on the slopes will be zero. Hmm. If R² is zero, does that mean all the slope coefficients are zero? Well, if the model doesn't explain any variability, it suggests that the independent variables don't have any effect on y. So the slopes would be zero because changing x doesn't change y. So I think i is true.

Statement ii: The fitted line will be horizontal with respect to all of the explanatory variables. A horizontal line in regression would mean that the slope is zero. Since the slope coefficients are zero (from statement i), the fitted line doesn't change with x. So yes, it's horizontal. So ii is also true.

Statement iii: The regression line has not explained any of the variability of y about its mean value. That's essentially what R² being zero means. R² is the proportion of variance explained. Zero means none, so iii is definitely true.

Statement iv: The intercept coefficient estimate must be zero. Wait, the intercept is the value of y when all x's are zero. Even if the model explains nothing, the intercept is just the mean of y, right? Because if the model can't explain any variation, the best prediction is the mean. So the intercept shouldn't necessarily be zero. It's the average value of y. So iv is false. Unless the mean of y is zero, but that's not necessarily the case. So iv is not true.

Now, let's look at the options. The question is which of the four statements are true.

So, statements i, ii, iii are true. Statement iv is false.

Looking at the options, option J is (i), (ii), and (iii) only. Option J says all three are correct, which matches my analysis.

Wait, but another thought: If R² is zero, what about the coefficients? Let me double-check. If in a simple regression, R² is zero, then the slope must be zero because R² is the square of the correlation coefficient. So yes, slope is zero. In multiple regression, each slope's coefficient being zero would also result in R² being zero because there's no explanatory power. So all slopes are zero, so i is true.

So the correct answer should include i, ii, iii, but not iv. So the correct option is J: (i), (ii), and (iii) only.

When the value of \( R^2 \) for an estimated regression model is exactly zero, it means that the model does not explain any of the variability in the dependent variable \( y \). Here's an analysis of the given statements:

1. **Statement i**: All coefficient estimates on the slopes will be zero.  
   This is true because if \( R^2 = 0 \), the independent variables do not explain any variation in \( y \), implying that the slope coefficients must be zero.

2. **Statement ii**: The fitted line will be horizontal with respect to all of the explanatory variables.  
   This is also true. A horizontal line in regression means that the slope is zero, which aligns with the fact that the independent variables have no effect on \( y \).

3. **Statement iii**: The regression line has not explained any of the variability of \( y \) about its mean value.  
   This is true by definition of \( R^2 \). A value of \( R^2 = 0 \) indicates that the model explains none of the variability in \( y \).

4. **Statement iv**: The intercept coefficient estimate must be zero.  
   This is false. The intercept represents the mean value of \( y \) when all explanatory variables are zero. It does not have to be zero unless the data specifically dictates it.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer includes statements (i), (ii), and (iii), but not (iv). Therefore, the correct option is:

**J: (i), (ii), and (iii) only.**
