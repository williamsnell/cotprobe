Okay, so I have this question about the shape of a sign outside Bob's Burger Barn. It's a regular octagon, and I need to find out the measure of an interior angle. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my geometry, but let's think this through.

First, I remember that a regular polygon has all sides and angles equal. So a regular octagon must have eight equal sides and eight equal angles. The question is about the interior angle, so I need to find the measure of one of those angles inside the octagon.

I think there's a formula for calculating the sum of interior angles in a polygon. Oh right, the formula is (n-2) multiplied by 180 degrees, where n is the number of sides. So for an octagon, n is 8. Let me calculate that.

Sum of interior angles = (8 - 2) * 180 = 6 * 180 = 1080 degrees. Okay, that makes sense because I remember that the more sides a polygon has, the larger the sum of its interior angles.

But wait, that's the total sum. The question asks for the measure of each interior angle. Since it's a regular octagon, all the interior angles are equal. So I just need to divide the total sum by the number of angles, which is 8.

So each interior angle = 1080 / 8. Let me do that division. 1080 divided by 8. Hmm, 8 times 135 is 1080 because 8*100=800, 8*35=280, 800+280=1080. So each angle is 135 degrees.

Wait, but I should double-check that I didn't mix up interior and exterior angles. I remember that the sum of each exterior angle of any polygon is 360 degrees. So for a regular polygon, each exterior angle is 360/n. So for octagon, that's 360/8=45 degrees per exterior angle.

Wait, so each exterior angle is 45 degrees. And since the interior and exterior angles are supplementary (they add up to 180 degrees because they are adjacent angles forming a straight line), each interior angle would be 180 - 45 = 135 degrees. Oh, that matches what I got earlier with the sum method. So that's good, I cross-verified and got the same answer.

So the measure of each interior angle is 135 degrees. Let me look at the options. Option H is 135. So the correct answer should be H.

To determine the measure of an interior angle of a regular octagon, we start by calculating the sum of its interior angles using the formula:

\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
\]

For a regular octagon (\(n = 8\)):

\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (8-2) \times 180^\circ = 6 \times 180^\circ = 1080^\circ
\]

Since the octagon is regular, all interior angles are equal. To find the measure of one interior angle, divide the total sum by the number of sides:

\[
\text{Each interior angle} = \frac{1080^\circ}{8} = 135^\circ
\]

To verify, we can also use the relationship between interior and exterior angles. The sum of exterior angles for any polygon is \(360^\circ\), so each exterior angle of a regular octagon is:

\[
\text{Each exterior angle} = \frac{360^\circ}{8} = 45^\circ
\]

Since interior and exterior angles are supplementary:

\[
\text{Each interior angle} = 180^\circ - 45^\circ = 135^\circ
\]

Both methods confirm that the measure of each interior angle is \(135^\circ\). From the given options, the correct answer is:

**H: 135**

Answer: H
