Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that in peas, tall (D) is dominant over dwarf (d), yellow (G) is dominant over green (g), and round (W) is dominant over wrinkled (w). We need to find out what fraction of the offspring from the cross GgDdww × GgddWw will be homozygous recessive in all gene pairs.

Hmm, okay. So each of these traits is governed by a separate gene, right? So we can look at each gene pair separately and then multiply the probabilities because they're independent.

Wait, wait. The parents are GgDdww and GgddWw. Let me break this down for each gene.

Starting with the G gene. The parents are Gg and Gg. Oh wait, no, wait. The first parent is Gg for the yellow/green trait, and the second parent is Gg as well? Wait, let me check. The first parent is GgDdww, so for the G locus, it's Gg. The second parent is GgddWw, so for G, it's also Gg. So both parents are Gg for the G gene.

Then for the D gene, the first parent is Dd, and the second is dd. So first is Dd, second is dd.

And for W gene, the first parent is ww, and the second parent is Ww.

Wait, the question is asking for the fraction of offspring that are homozygous recessive in all gene pairs. So that means for each gene, the offspring must be homozygous recessive. So for each gene, determine the chance that the offspring is homozygous recessive.

So, for each gene, calculate the probability, then multiply them together because the events are independent.

Let's handle each gene one by one.

First gene: G (yellow vs green). The parents are Gg × Gg.

Wait, no. Wait the parents are GgDdww × GgddWw. So, for the G gene: parents are Gg (first) and Gg (second). So the cross is Gg × Gg.

What's the probability that an offspring will be homozygous recessive (gg) here?

The possible gametes from each Gg parent are G and g, each with 50% chance.

So for the G gene cross:

Offspring genotypes:
GG (25%)
Gg (50%)
gg (25%)

So the chance of gg is 25% or 1/4.

Wait, wait, but wait. No, wait, the way the parents are set up for each gene:

Wait, no, in the first parent, for G, yes Gg, and second parent Gg. So yeah, cross of Gg × Gg for G.

So 25% chance for gg.

Second gene: D (tall vs dwarf). The parents are Dd (first) and dd (second). So the cross is Dd × dd.

What's the probability of the offspring being homozygous recessive (dd) for this gene.

So Dd × dd:

Each parent can produce gametes. Dd parent can produce D and d gametes, each 50% chance. The dd parent can only produce d gametes, 100%.

So the possible offspring from Dd × dd:

D (50%) from Dd's D and dd's d → Dd
d (50%) from Dd's d and dd's d → dd

Wait, wait, no. Wait, Dd × dd is:

- For each gamete from Dd: D (50%) or d (50%)
- Gamete from dd: d (100%)

So, the possible offspring genotypes:

- D (from D) + d (from dd) → Dd
- d (from Dd) + d (from dd) → dd

So each has 50% chance.

So the chance of being dd is 50% or 1/2.

Wait, but the question is about being homozygous recessive, so for D, it's dd, which occurs with 50% probability.

Now, the third gene: W (round vs wrinkled). The parents are ww (first) and Ww (second). So the cross is ww × Ww.

What's the probability that the offspring is homozygous recessive (ww) for this gene?

Let's look at the possible gametes.

Parent ww can only produce w gametes (100%).

Parent Ww can produce W (50%) or w (50%).

So the possible offspring:

- w (from ww) and W (from Ww) → Ww
- w (from ww) and w (from Ww) → ww

Each occurs 50% of the time.

So the chance of being ww is 50% or 1/2.

Now, to find the overall probability that the offspring is homozygous recessive for all three genes, we need to multiply the probabilities for each gene.

So for G: 1/4, D: 1/2, W: 1/2.

Multiply them together: (1/4) * (1/2) * (1/2) = (1/4) * (1/4) ) = 1/16.

Wait, 1/4 times 1/2 is 1/8, then times another 1/2 is 1/16.

So the fraction is 1/16.

Looking at the options, option E is 1/16.

To determine the fraction of offspring that are homozygous recessive in all gene pairs from the cross **GgDdww × GgddWw**, we analyze each gene separately and then multiply the probabilities, as the genes assort independently.

### Gene 1: **G (Yellow vs Green)**
- Parent genotypes: **Gg × Gg**
- Possible offspring genotypes:
  - **GG** (25%)
  - **Gg** (50%)
  - **gg** (25%)
- Probability of **gg** (homozygous recessive): **1/4**

### Gene 2: **D (Tall vs Dwarf)**
- Parent genotypes: **Dd × dd**
- Possible offspring genotypes:
  - **Dd** (50%)
  - **dd** (50%)
- Probability of **dd** (homozygous recessive): **1/2**

### Gene 3: **W (Round vs Wrinkled)**
- Parent genotypes: **ww × Ww**
- Possible offspring genotypes:
  - **Ww** (50%)
  - **ww** (50%)
- Probability of **ww** (homozygous recessive): **1/2**

### Combined Probability
To find the fraction of offspring homozygous recessive for all three genes, multiply the probabilities for each gene:
\[
\text{Total probability} = \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{16}
\]

### Final Answer
The fraction of offspring that are homozygous recessive in all gene pairs is **1/16**, which corresponds to **option E**.
