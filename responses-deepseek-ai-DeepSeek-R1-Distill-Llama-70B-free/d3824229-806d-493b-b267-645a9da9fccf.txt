Question:

To determine the average number of children living in single-family homes, a researcher picks a simple random sample of 50 such homes. However, even after one follow-up visit the interviewer is unable to make contact with anyone in 8 of these homes. Concerned about nonresponse bias, the researcher picks another simple random sample and instructs the interviewer to keep trying until contact is made with someone in a total of 50 homes. The average number of children is determined to be 1.73. Is this estimate probably too low or too high?

Options:

A: Too high, because the sample size is not large enough.
B: Too low, because nonresponse bias tends to underestimate average results.
C: Too high, because convenience samples overestimate average results.
D: Too low, because of undercoverage bias.
E: Too low, because the sample size is not large enough.
F: Too high, due to the possibility of a skewed sample.
G: Too high, because of undercoverage bias.
H: Too low, because convenience samples overestimate average results.
I: Too low, due to the possibility of a skewed sample.
J: Too high, because nonresponse bias tends to overestimate average results.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the estimate of the average number of children is too high or too low based on the scenario given. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, the researcher is trying to determine the average number of children in single-family homes. They start by taking a simple random sample of 50 homes. But after one follow-up visit, they can't contact anyone in 8 of these homes. That means out of 50, only 42 homes responded. Now, the researcher is worried about nonresponse bias, which makes sense because if some people aren't responding, their data isn't being captured, and this can skew the results.

So, the researcher decides to take another simple random sample and tells the interviewer to keep trying until contact is made with someone in a total of 50 homes. This means that in this new attempt, they successfully contact all 50 homes. They find an average of 1.73 children per home.

The question is whether this estimate is too high or too low. The options suggest various biases and reasons, so I need to think about what each bias means.

Nonresponse bias occurs when the people who don't respond differ from those who do. For example, maybe the 8 homes they couldn't contact have different characteristics. Let's say those 8 homes are more likely to have more children. If they're not included, the average would be lower than the true average because those larger families aren't counted. Alternatively, maybe those 8 homes have fewer children, which would make the average higher than it should be.

Wait, but in the first sample, 8 homes were not contacted. The researcher then took another sample and got 50 responses. So, in the second sample, they made sure to contact all 50. But is the second sample representative?

Alternatively, maybe the initial 8 nonrespondents in the first sample were different. But the question is about the second sample. Or is the problem that in the second sample, they tried harder to get responses, but perhaps the way they did it introduced some bias?

Wait, the second approach was to pick another simple random sample and instruct the interviewer to keep trying until contact is made. So in this case, they managed to get responses from all 50. So the nonresponse rate here is zero. But what if the characteristics of the nonrespondents in the first sample differ from the respondents?

Wait, perhaps the initial 8 nonrespondents are different. For example, maybe those families are busier, have more children, and thus were harder to reach. If they have more children, then excluding them would lower the average. So the first sample's average, based on 42 homes, would be lower than the true average because the 8 nonrespondents have more kids.

But in the second sample, the researcher made sure to contact all 50. So if the second sample is a new random sample, perhaps it's more representative. But wait, the question is about the estimate from the second sample. Or is there another issue?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the second sample is no longer a random sample because the interviewer kept trying until contact was made, but that's not correct because they just took another random sample and ensured all were contacted.

Wait, no, the second sample is another simple random sample, so it's still random. But perhaps the issue is that in the first sample, the nonrespondents were different. But in the second sample, maybe there's still some nonresponse if the researcher only took a new sample without considering the previous nonresponse.

Wait, no, the second sample is a new simple random sample of 50, and the interviewer managed to contact all of them. So this would mean that the second sample is more complete. But how does this relate to the estimate?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The first sample had 8 nonrespondents. If those 8 homes have a higher number of children than average, then their exclusion would make the average lower. So the initial average (from 42 homes) would be lower than the true average. So the researcher was concerned about this nonresponse bias leading to an underestimate.

So to fix this, they took another sample, making sure to get all 50 responses. Now, the new average is 1.73. The question is whether this is too high or too low.

But wait, what if the nonrespondents in the first sample actually had fewer children? Then the initial average would have been higher. But the researcher was concerned about nonresponse bias, which could go either way. However, the researcher is trying to get a more accurate sample by ensuring all 50 respond.

Alternatively, perhaps the second sample is still subject to some bias. Wait, the second sample is another simple random sample, so it should be representative. However, maybe the way they collected data (keeping trying) introduced some bias. For example, perhaps the people who are harder to reach (like those with more children, who are busier) ended up being included. So their data is now part of the sample, which might mean the average is higher than if they had been excluded.

Wait, but in the first scenario, the 8 nonrespondents were excluded, leading to a lower average (if they had more kids). Now, in the second sample, all 50 are included, so it's a more accurate representation. So the new average (1.73) would be higher than the initial estimate from the first sample (which was based on 42 homes with possible lower average).

But the question is whether the estimate of 1.73 is too high or too low. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the issue is undercoverage bias. Undercoverage occurs when some members of the population have no chance of being selected in the sample. For example, if some homes are not listed in the sampling frame. But in this case, the researcher is using a simple random sample, so undercoverage might not be the issue here unless the sampling frame is incomplete.

Wait, but in the second approach, they took another simple random sample and got all 50. So if the initial nonrespondents were part of the population but just harder to reach, then ensuring they are included would give a better estimate.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the second sample is a convenience sample. But no, the question says the researcher picked another simple random sample, so it's still random.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option B: Too low, because nonresponse bias tends to underestimate average results.

Option J: Too high, because nonresponse bias tends to overestimate average results.

But wait, nonresponse bias could go either way. It depends on whether the nonrespondents have higher or lower values than the respondents.

In the first sample, if the 8 nonrespondents had more children, then the average would be lower in the initial sample. So when the researcher took a second sample and got 50 responses, perhaps the new average is higher than the initial, but is it higher or lower than the true average?

Alternatively, perhaps the second sample's average is correct, but the question is whether it's biased. Wait, the question is about the estimate from the second sample. Wait, no, the question is whether the estimate from the second sample is too high or too low.

Wait, the second sample's estimate is 1.73. The concern is whether this is accurate. But if in the first sample, nonresponse led to an underestimate (because nonrespondents had more children), then the second sample's average, which includes all 50, would be higher and closer to the true average.

But the question is about whether the second sample's estimate is too high or too low. If the nonrespondents in the first sample had more children, then the initial sample's average was too low. The second sample, with all responding, would have a higher average, which is more accurate.

But the question is whether the second sample's estimate (1.73) is too high or too low. So if the nonrespondents in the first sample had more children, then the second sample's average is higher than the initial sample, but is it over or under the true average?

Wait, perhaps the second sample is less biased. Because in the first sample, nonrespondents were excluded, leading to a lower average. The second sample includes all, so the average would be higher, which could be closer to the true average. So if the true average is higher than 1.73, then the estimate would be too low. Or is it the other way around?

Alternatively, perhaps the nonresponse in the first sample was leading to an underestimate, so the second sample corrects that, making the estimate higher. So if the second sample's average is 1.73, it's a more accurate estimate. But the question is whether this estimate is too high or too low, implying that the researcher is concerned about whether it's biased.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key is that nonresponse can cause bias if the nonrespondents differ from respondents. The initial sample had 8 nonrespondents. If those nonrespondents have more children, then the initial sample average (from 42) would be lower than the true average. So the researcher decided to get a new sample with no nonresponse, so the new average would be higher. But is the new average an overestimate or underestimate?

Wait, the new sample is a separate simple random sample. So if the nonrespondents in the first sample were not representative, but the second sample is fully responded, the new estimate should be unbiased.

But the question is whether the estimate is probably too low or too high. The options suggest various reasons.

Wait, another angle: when nonresponse occurs, and you don't adjust for it, your sample may be biased. If you make efforts to include the nonrespondents, you get a more accurate sample. So if the initial nonrespondents had higher values (more children), then the initial sample's average was too low. The second sample, by including all, would have a higher average, which is more accurate.

But the question is about the second sample's estimate. If the second sample's average is 1.73, is that higher or lower than the true average?

Alternatively, perhaps the initial nonrespondents have lower averages. Then the initial sample's average would be higher, and the second sample, including them, would bring the average down.

Wait, but without knowing whether the nonrespondents have higher or lower values, it's hard to say. However, the question states that the researcher is concerned about nonresponse bias. So perhaps the nonrespondents are different in a way that the average is being underestimated.

Wait, the question says that the researcher is concerned about nonresponse bias. So perhaps the initial sample of 42 had an average that was lower than the true average because the 8 nonrespondents had more children. Thus, when the researcher takes a new sample and gets all 50, the average is 1.73, which is higher. But the question is whether this new estimate is too high or too low.

Wait, no, the question is asking whether the estimate is too high or too low, not compared to the initial but in general. So perhaps the second sample's estimate is unbiased, but maybe it's not, due to other biases.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option D: Too low, because of undercoverage bias.

Option B: Too low, because nonresponse bias tends to underestimate.

Option J: Too high, because nonresponse bias tends to overestimate.

Wait, nonresponse bias can cause either, but the question is about the direction in this case. The researcher took a new sample and got a higher response rate. So if in the first sample, nonresponse caused the average to be lower, then the second sample would correct that, leading to a higher average. But is that average now higher than the true average?

No, the second sample is a new random sample, so it should be unbiased. Wait, but the question is whether the estimate is too high or too low. If the second sample's average is 1.73, and the true average is higher, then the estimate is too low. Or if the true average is lower, then it's too high.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a key point. The initial sample had 8 nonrespondents, and the researcher took another sample. But what if the second sample's nonrespondents (if any) are still not representative? No, because the interviewer kept trying until contact was made, so there are no nonrespondents in the second sample.

So the second sample is a simple random sample with no nonresponse. Therefore, it's an unbiased estimate. So why is the question implying that the estimate might be too high or low?

Wait, maybe the problem is that the second sample replaced the initial nonrespondents, but in reality, the nonrespondents in the first sample were part of the same population. But the second sample is a new random sample, so it's a different set of 50 homes. So the second sample's average is an unbiased estimate of the population average.

But the question is about whether the estimate is too high or too low. If the nonrespondents in the first sample had higher values, then the initial average was too low. The second sample's average, being unbiased, would be higher than that initial average. But compared to the true average, it's accurate.

Wait, but the question is whether the estimate from the second sample is too high or too low. If the second sample is unbiased, then it's neither too high nor too low. But the options don't have that choice.

Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the scenario. Let's read it again.

The researcher picks an initial sample of 50, but can't contact 8. Then, picks another sample of 50 and ensures contact. The average from the second sample is 1.73. Is this estimate too high or too low?

Wait, maybe the issue is that the second sample is a new sample, so it's a different set of homes. But the problem is that the population may have homes that are harder to contact (like those with more children), which are underrepresented in the first sample but properly represented in the second. So the second sample's average is higher than the first but accurate.

Wait, but the question is about the second sample's estimate compared to the true average. If the second sample is unbiased, then the estimate is accurate. But perhaps the question is implying that the second sample is overcounting or undercounting.

Alternatively, perhaps the second sample's data collection introduced some bias. For example, maybe the interviewer kept trying until contact was made, which could mean that the sample is skewed towards homes where people are available during certain times, which might not represent the whole population. But that's more about nonresponse again.

Wait, but the key point is the nonresponse bias in the first sample. The researcher was concerned that the initial sample's average was too low because the nonrespondents had more children. So to correct this, they took a new sample with no nonresponse, which should give a more accurate (higher) average. So the second sample's average of 1.73 is probably higher than the initial, but is it too high or too low compared to the true average?

Wait, the true average would depend on the population. If the nonrespondents in the first sample had higher values, then the second sample's average would be closer to the true average, making the initial sample's average too low. But the question is about the second sample's average, which should be unbiased.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that by taking another sample, the researcher is not accounting for the fact that some homes are harder to reach, but in this case, they made sure to contact all, so it's a proper sample.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Option B: Too low, because nonresponse bias tends to underestimate average results.

If nonresponse bias leads to underestimation, then the initial sample's average was too low. The second sample's average is higher and more accurate. So the second sample's estimate should be correct, not too low. So option B would be incorrect.

Option J: Too high, because nonresponse bias tends to overestimate average results.

No, because nonresponse bias can go either way. If nonrespondents have higher values, then the average is underestimated. If they have lower, the average is overestimated.

But in this case, the researcher was concerned about nonresponse bias leading to an underestimate, so they took a new sample. So the second sample's average is more accurate, so the estimate is correct, not too high or too low.

Wait, but the question is whether the estimate is probably too high or too low. So perhaps the second sample's average is unbiased, but that's not one of the options. So maybe I'm missing something else.

Another angle: perhaps the second sample's average is 1.73, but the true average is higher. Why? Because maybe the nonrespondents in the first sample were part of the same population, but in the second sample, which is a new random sample, the nonrespondents are different. But no, in the second sample, all 50 were contacted.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the initial sample's nonresponse was due to the homes having more children, and the second sample's nonresponse (if any) was different. But in the second sample, there was no nonresponse.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that by replacing the initial sample with a new one, the researcher introduced another form of bias. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial nonresponse led to an underestimate, but the second sample's average is now accurate, so the estimate of 1.73 is correct. But the question is whether it's too high or too low, implying that it's biased.

Wait, I'm going in circles. Let me think of it this way: nonresponse bias occurs when the nonrespondents differ from respondents. If the nonrespondents have more children, then the average from respondents is lower. So the initial sample's average was too low. The researcher then took a new sample with no nonresponse, so the new average is higher and more accurate.

But the question is about the new estimate. If the new estimate is accurate, then it's neither too high nor too low. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is implying that the new estimate is biased in some way.

Wait, another thought: maybe the second sample's average is based on a different group of people, so the estimate is not comparable. But no, it's a simple random sample from the same population.

Alternatively, perhaps the second sample's data was collected differently, introducing measurement bias. But the question doesn't mention that.

Wait, looking at the options again, perhaps the correct answer is B: Too low, because nonresponse bias tends to underestimate average results. But wait, that would apply to the initial sample, not the second.

Alternatively, perhaps the second sample's average is still too low because of some other bias. Maybe the undercoverage bias, where certain groups are not covered in the sampling frame. For example, if some single-family homes are not listed, then the sample is biased. But the question doesn't mention that.

Option D says too low because of undercoverage bias. Undercoverage occurs when some population members are not in the sampling frame. If that's the case, the sample would miss those people, leading to a biased estimate. But the question doesn't indicate that; it's about nonresponse, not undercoverage.
