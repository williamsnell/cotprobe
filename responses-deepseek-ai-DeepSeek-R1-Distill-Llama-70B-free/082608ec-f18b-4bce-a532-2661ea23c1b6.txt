Okay, so I have this chemistry question in front of me, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's read it again: "A reaction that includes energy as one of its reactants is called a(n)..." with options A through J.

Hmm, I remember that in chemistry, reactions can be classified based on various factors. One of them is whether they absorb or release energy. Oh right, endergonic and exergonic reactions. Endergonic reactions absorb energy, right? Because 'ender' means inside, so energy goes into the system. Exergonic reactions release energy, so 'exo' meaning outside.

Wait, the question says the reaction includes energy as a reactant. So the reactants are consuming energy. Which type of reaction is that? Oh, endergonic. Because in endergonic reactions, energy is required for the reaction to proceed. So the reaction uses energy, meaning energy is a reactant.

Alternatively, exergonic reactions release energy, so energy isn't a reactant there. So looking at the options, option A is endergonic reaction. Option E is exergonic, which would be the opposite.

Wait, maybe I should think about other options too. Let me go through them one by one. Catabolic reactions are about breaking down molecules, like in metabolism, and they usually release energy. So probably exergonic. Anabolic reactions build up, which require energy, so they are endergonic. That's another way to remember: anabolic is 'building up' needing energy, so endergonic.

But the question is specifically about the reaction including energy as a reactant. So it's not about the broader classification of anabolic versus catabolic. It's about whether the reaction itself takes in energy.

So the correct term is endergonic reaction. Looking back, option A is endergonic. So the answer should be A.

The correct answer is A: endergonic reaction. Endergonic reactions are those that require energy as a reactant to proceed, as opposed to exergonic reactions, which release energy.

Answer: A
