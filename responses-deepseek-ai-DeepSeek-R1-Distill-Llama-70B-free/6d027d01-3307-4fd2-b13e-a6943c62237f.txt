Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about blackbody radiation and the Earth's temperature. Hmm, I remember something about blackbody radiation from my classes. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says the mean temperature of the Earth's surface is 288 K. I need to find the maximum wavelength of the Earth's blackbody radiation. Oh right, blackbody radiation has a peak wavelength that depends on temperature. There's a law related to this, I think it's Wien's Law or something like that.

Wait, Wein's Law... yes, Wien's Displacement Law. I remember the formula. I think it's lambda_max equals some constant divided by the temperature. Let me recall the exact formula. Oh yeah, lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact value of b. Wait, I think it's approximately 2.9 × 10^-3 m·K. Yeah, that sounds right.

So the temperature given is 288 K. Plugging that into the formula, lambda_max = (2.9e-3 m·K) / 288 K. Let me calculate that. Wait, let me make sure I'm doing the math right. 

First, 2.9 times 1e-3 is 0.0029. Dividing that by 288. Let me do 0.0029 divided by 288. Alternatively, I can write it as 2.9e-3 / 288.

Hmm, let's compute it. 2.9 divided by 288. Let's see, 288 goes into 2.9 how many times? 288 is about 2.88e2. So 2.9 is roughly 2.9e-3, so 2.9e-3 / 2.88e2 equals approximately 1.007e-5 meters. Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 2.9e-3 divided by 288. Let me convert 288 to scientific notation, which is 2.88 × 10^2. So 2.9e-3 is 2.9 × 10^-3. So when you divide, (2.9 / 2.88) × 10^(-3-2) = (approximately 1.007) × 10^-5. So that's about 1.007e-5 meters. 

Wait, 1e-5 meters is 1e-5 m, which is 1.0 ×10^-5 m. Looking at the options, let me see which one matches this. Let me look at the options again.

Options are:

A: 0.7 x10^-5 m

B: 1.2 10^-5 m

C: 2.5 x10^-5 m

D:3.0 x10^-5 m

E:2.0 x10^-5 m

F:0.9 x10^-5 m

G:1.01 x10^-5 m

H:1.6 x10^-5 m

I:1.5 x10^-5 m

J:0.5 x10^-5 m

So my calculation gave approximately 1.007e-5 m, which is very close to option G, which is 1.01e-5 m. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I get the formula right? Wien's law states lambda_max * T = b. Yes, and b is about 2.9e-3 m·K. So yes, 2.9e-3 / 288 should be correct.

Wait, let me compute it more precisely. 2.9 divided by 288 equals approximately 0.010069444... So 0.010069e-2 meters? Wait, no. Wait, 2.9e-3 m·K divided by 288 K is (2.9/288) × 1e-3 m. Oh wait, wait, no. Let me do it correctly.

Let me compute 2.9e-3 divided by 288. 2.9e-3 is 0.0029. 0.0029 divided by 288. Let me compute 0.0029 / 288.

Well, 288 goes into 0.0029 how many times? 

288 * 1e-5 is 0.00288. So 0.0029 is just a bit more than that. So 0.0029 - 0.00288 = 0.00002. So that would be 1e-5 plus 0.00002 / 288. 

Wait, 0.00002 divided by 288 is approximately 6.94e-8. So total lambda_max is approximately 1.00694e-5 m, which is 1.00694 ×10^-5 m. So about 1.007e-5 m. So the closest option is G: 1.01e-5 m. So the answer is G.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 2.9e-3 / 288 numerically.

Compute 2.9 / 288 = ?

288 * 0.01 is 2.88. So 2.88 is 288 * 0.01. 2.9 is 0.02 more than 2.88, so 2.9 = 288*(0.01) + 0.02. So 2.9/288 = 0.01 + 0.02/288. 0.02/288 is 0.000069444... So 0.01 + 0.000069444 = 0.010069444...

So 2.9e-3 / 288 = 0.010069444e-3 m? Wait, no. Wait, 2.9e-3 is 0.0029. 0.0029 / 288 = 0.00001006944 m, which is 1.006944e-5 m, which is 1.00694e-5 m, so about 1.007e-5 m.

Looking at the options, G is 1.01e-5 m. That's very close. So yes, the correct answer should be G.

To determine the maximum wavelength of the Earth's blackbody radiation, we use **Wien's Displacement Law**, which states:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}
\]

where:
- \( b \) is Wien's displacement constant, approximately \( 2.9 \times 10^{-3} \, \mathrm{m \cdot K} \),
- \( T \) is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.

Given \( T = 288 \, \mathrm{K} \), we substitute into the formula:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{2.9 \times 10^{-3}}{288}
\]

Performing the calculation:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{2.9}{288} \times 10^{-3} \approx 0.01006944 \times 10^{-3} \, \mathrm{m} = 1.006944 \times 10^{-5} \, \mathrm{m}
\]

This value is approximately \( 1.007 \times 10^{-5} \, \mathrm{m} \), which is closest to option **G: \( 1.01 \times 10^{-5} \, \mathrm{m} \)**.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**G**
