Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So the question is about finding the maximum number of acute angles in a convex 10-gon. Hmm, a convex polygon means all its interior angles are less than 180 degrees, right? So each angle is between 0 and 180, but not including 180.

An acute angle is one that's less than 90 degrees. So we're trying to figure out, in a 10-sided convex polygon, what's the largest number of angles that can be less than 90 degrees.

Wait, but I remember that the sum of the interior angles of an n-gon is (n-2)*180 degrees. For a decagon (10-gon), that would be (10-2)*180 = 8*180 = 1440 degrees. So all ten angles add up to 1440.

The challenge is to have as many angles as possible be acute (each less than 90), while ensuring the polygon remains convex. But wait, if too many angles are acute, the sum might not add up to 1440. Because the other angles would have to compensate by being larger, but not exceeding 180 since it's convex.

Let me think about this. Let's say we have 'k' acute angles. Each of these is less than 90, so let's approximate each as 90 for the maximum case, but actually, since they're less than 90, maybe we can model their sum as 90k. Then the remaining (10 - k) angles must be greater than 90 but less than 180.

So the total sum would be less than 90k + 180*(10 -k). But we know the actual sum is 1440. Hmm, but wait, the actual sum is exactly 1440. So the condition is that:

Sum(acute angles) + Sum(other angles) = 1440.

But each acute angle is less than 90, so Sum(acute) < 90k.

Each of the other (10 -k) angles is convex, so less than 180, so Sum(other) < 180*(10 -k).

Putting it together: Sum(acute) + Sum(other) < 90k + 180(10 -k).

But the actual sum is 1440, which is equal to (10-2)*180 = 1440. So we have:

1440 < 90k + 180(10 -k).

Wait, that can't be right. Because 90k + 180(10 -k) = 90k + 1800 -180k = 1800 -90k.

So 1440 < 1800 -90k.

Let me solve for k:

1800 -90k > 1440.

Subtract 1440 from both sides: 360 -90k > 0.

So 360 >90k → 4 >k. So k must be less than 4. So the maximum possible k is 3.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me check that again because I might have messed up.

The sum of the interior angles is exactly 1440. So the sum of the acute angles (each <90) plus the sum of the remaining angles (each <180) must equal 1440.

But if I model the acute angles as exactly 90, and the others as exactly 180, the sum would be 90k + 180(10−k) = 90k + 1800 −180k = 1800 −90k.

But the real sum is 1440, so 1800−90k must be greater than 1440 because each acute is less than 90 and each other is less than 180, making their sum less than 90k + 180(10−k) = 1800−90k. Therefore, 1800−90k > 1440 → which gives 90k < 360 → k <4.

So k must be less than 4, so the maximum k is 3.

Wait, but another approach: Suppose we have 'k' acute angles. Each acute angle is at most just under 90, say approaching 90 from below. Then the sum of all angles is 1440.

So suppose we have k angles of 90 degrees (even though they have to be less, but to find maximum k, we can model them as 90, because if 90k is too large, then with angles less than 90, the sum would be even larger. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, if the acute angles are less than 90, their sum would be less than 90k. So if I model with 90, that's the maximum they can be. So the sum of the other angles would then be 1440 - sum(acute) > 1440 -90k.

But the other angles are each less than 180, so their sum is less than 180*(10 -k).

So 1440 - 90k < 180(10 -k).

Let me compute that:

1440 -90k < 1800 -180k.

Add 180k to both sides:

1440 +90k < 1800.

Subtract 1440:

90k < 360 → k <4.

So again, k must be less than 4, which means maximum of 3.

So the maximum number of acute angles is 3, which is option A:3.

Wait, but I've heard somewhere that in a convex quadrilateral, you can have at most 3 acute angles. So maybe in a pentagon, can you have more? Hmm, but in this case, for a 10-gon, the maximum is 3.

So the answer should be A.
</think>

To determine the maximum number of acute angles in a convex 10-gon, we start by noting that a convex polygon has all interior angles less than \(180^\circ\), and an acute angle is one that is less than \(90^\circ\). The sum of the interior angles of a 10-gon is given by \((n-2) \cdot 180^\circ = 1440^\circ\).

Let \(k\) represent the number of acute angles. Each acute angle is less than \(90^\circ\), so the sum of the \(k\) acute angles is less than \(90k\). The remaining \(10-k\) angles must be greater than \(90^\circ\) but less than \(180^\circ\), so their sum is less than \(180(10-k)\). The total sum of all angles is:

\[
\text{Sum of acute angles} + \text{Sum of other angles} = 1440.
\]

We can model the sum of the acute angles as \(90k\) (their maximum possible value) and the sum of the other angles as \(180(10-k)\) (their maximum possible value). Thus:

\[
90k + 180(10-k) > 1440.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
90k + 1800 - 180k > 1440,
\]

\[
-90k + 1800 > 1440,
\]

\[
-90k > -360,
\]

\[
k < 4.
\]

This means the maximum number of acute angles \(k\) is 3. If \(k = 4\), the sum of the angles would exceed \(1440^\circ\), violating the condition for a convex 10-gon.

Thus, the maximum number of acute angles in a convex 10-gon is **3**.
