Question:

Bob Wilson borrowed $20,000 from Ted Lamar to open a hardware store. Ted's only interest in the business was the repayment of his 5-year unsecured loan. Bob was so grateful for the loan that he named his business "Wilson and Lamar Hardware" and purchased signs and advertising displaying this name. He also listed Bob Wilson and Ted Lamar as "partners" on his stationery. When Ted found out, he was flattered to the point that he voluntarily reduced Bob's interest rate from 9 percent to 8 percent per annum. A few weeks later, Pete Smith, who had assumed that both Wilson and Lamar were operating the hardware store and was not familiar with the true situation, sold goods to Wilson and Lamar Hardware. Pete Smith has been unable to collect for the goods and he seeks your advice. Your advice to Pete is

Okay, so I've got this question here about business organizations and liability. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on partnership law, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

So, the situation is that Bob Wilson borrowed $20,000 from Ted Lamar to start a hardware store. Ted's only interest was getting his loan back with some interest. Bob was really grateful, so he named the business "Wilson and Lamar Hardware" and put their names on signs, ads, and stationery as "partners." 

Then, Ted found out about this and felt flattered, so he reduced the interest rate from 9% to 8%. Later, Pete Smith sold goods to the store, thinking both were partners, and now he can't collect. He's asking for advice on who is liable.

The question is about whether Bob, Ted, or both are liable for the debts of the business, specifically the goods Pete sold.

Hmm, so the key here is to figure out whether Ted Lamar is considered a partner, making him liable for the business's debts. Partnerships can be a bit tricky because there are different types, like general partnerships, limited partnerships, and even de facto or de jure partnerships.

So, Ted only loaned money to Bob. He didn't participate in the business's management, right? His only interest was repayment. But Bob made it look like Ted was a partner by putting their names together as partners on signs and stationery.

I remember that when a person allows their name to be used as a partner, even if they're not actually a partner, they can be held liable as a partner. This is called "apparent partnership" or "ostensible partnership." So, if someone holds themselves out as a partner, or allows another to do so, and a third party relies on that, the apparent partner can be liable.

In this case, Bob held Ted out as a partner, and Ted didn't correct that. In fact, when Ted found out, he was flattered and reduced the interest rate. Wait, but does that action affect anything? Maybe not directly, but the fact that Ted didn't object or take steps to correct the public perception might be important.

So, when Pete Smith sold goods, he did so under the assumption that both were partners because of the name and the stationery. Therefore, under the doctrine of apparent authority or apparent partnership, Ted might be liable even though he's not an actual partner.

Wait, but was Ted's only involvement the loan? He didn't share profits or manage the business. So, in the eyes of the law, if a third party reasonably believes someone is a partner, that person can be held liable for the partnership debts, even if there's no actual partnership.

So, in this scenario, Pete would be able to hold both Bob and Ted liable because Ted appeared to be a partner. Therefore, Ted could be jointly liable with Bob for the debts incurred by the business, like the goods Pete sold.

But wait, what about the initial agreement between Bob and Ted? They had a loan agreement, not a partnership. Partnerships require mutual intent to be partners and share in profits and losses. Here, Ted wasn't sharing in the profits; he was just getting interest on his loan. So, in reality, they weren't partners. But to outsiders, it looked like they were.

So, the concept here is "apparent partnership." Under the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA), a person can be held liable as a partner if they knowingly allow another to represent them as a partner, and a third party relies on that representation to their detriment.

In this case, Ted allowed Bob to represent him as a partner by not objecting to the use of their names on the business. So, Ted could be estopped from denying partnership status when Pete relied on that representation.

Therefore, both Bob and Ted would be jointly liable for the debts of the business. That would mean Pete can go after both of them.

Looking at the options, option C says Bob and Ted are liable jointly. Option E says Bob is liable for the entire amount, and Ted is only liable if Bob can't pay. Option E sounds like it's talking about a general partner and a limited partner, but Ted isn't a limited partner here because he didn't agree to that. He was just a lender.

Option B says neither is liable, which can't be right because Bob is clearly liable as the business owner. Option A says the business is solely liable, but if Bob is the sole proprietor, then he is personally liable. If it's a partnership, both are liable. So, the business's liability would depend on the structure.

Wait, wait. Bob's business is a sole proprietorship, but he's holding out Ted as a partner. So, in the eyes of the law, if someone deals with the business thinking Ted is a partner, Ted becomes liable as if he were a partner. So, both would be personally liable for the debts incurred, even though it's not a real partnership.

Yeah, so the correct answer is that Bob and Ted are jointly liable. So, option C.

The question revolves around determining the liability of Bob Wilson and Ted Lamar for debts incurred by "Wilson and Lamar Hardware." Bob borrowed $20,000 from Ted Lamar to start the business, and their agreement was a loan with interest. However, Bob represented Ted as a partner by naming the business "Wilson and Lamar Hardware" and listing both names on signs, stationery, and advertisements. Ted, upon discovering this, did not object and even reduced the interest rate, which could imply acquiescence to being perceived as a partner.

Under partnership law, a person who knowingly allows themselves to be represented as a partner, and a third party relies on this representation to their detriment, may be held liable as an ostensible or apparent partner. In this case, Pete Smith, a third party, sold goods to the business under the belief that both Bob and Ted were partners. Therefore, Ted Lamar, despite not being an actual partner, may be held liable for the debts of the business due to the doctrine of apparent partnership.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The business entity is not solely liable because the structure appears to be a sole proprietorship, and Bob, as the owner, is personally liable.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Bob is clearly liable as the business owner, and Ted may also be liable under the doctrine of apparent partnership.
- **Option C**: Correct. Both Bob and Ted are jointly liable because Ted's inaction and Bob's actions created the appearance of a partnership, making Ted liable for the debts incurred.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. There is no indication that liability is limited to the amount of the loan or divided in such a manner.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. This option suggests a general partner and limited partner relationship, which does not apply here since Ted was only a lender.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Ted is not solely liable; Bob, as the business owner, is also liable.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. A de jure partnership requires mutual intent to form a partnership, which is absent here.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. While both may be liable, they are not independently liable but rather jointly liable due to the apparent partnership.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. A de facto partnership also requires mutual intent, which is not present in this case.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. Bob is not the only liable party; Ted may also be liable due to the apparent partnership.

The correct answer is that Bob Wilson and Ted Lamar are jointly liable for the debts of the business. 

Answer: C
