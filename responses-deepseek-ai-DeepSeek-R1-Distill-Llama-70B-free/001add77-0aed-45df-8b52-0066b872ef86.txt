Okay, so I have this question about English law and jurisdiction, specifically regarding extra-territorial abduction. Hmm, I need to figure out whether such an abduction is a ground for refusing jurisdiction in English courts. The options are A through I, and I have to pick the right one.

First, I should understand what extra-territorial abduction means. I think it refers to when someone is kidnapped or taken from another country and brought to the jurisdiction where the court is, in this case, England. So, if someone is abducted from, say, France and brought to the UK, does that affect the English court's ability to hear the case?

I remember something about the process of how courts handle cases where the defendant was brought there unlawfully. I think this might relate to the concept of "abuse of process." There's a legal principle where if the court's process is abused, the court can stay the proceedings. So, if someone was abducted and brought to face trial, the court might consider that an abuse because it's an unlawful way to get jurisdiction over the person.

Wait, I think the case of R v. Horseferry Road Magistrates' Court, ex parte Bennett [1994] might be relevant here. In that case, a person was abducted from South Africa and brought to the UK to face trial. The House of Lords held that the English court should exercise its discretion to stay the proceedings because the abduction was a violation of international law and the UK's sovereignty. So, the court considered it an abuse of process and stayed the proceedings.

So, in that situation, the English court refused to hear the case because of the unlawful abduction. But does that mean it's an automatic refusal, or is it discretionary?

Looking at the options:

Option H says that such abduction constitutes abuse of process and leads to a stay of proceedings. That aligns with what I remember about the Bennett case. The court has the discretion to stay the proceedings if it's an abuse of process.

Option F says the abduction gives rise to liability but doesn't lead to a stay. But in Bennett, the proceedings were stayed, so F doesn't seem correct.

Option E says the court's jurisdiction is nullified. No, because jurisdiction isn't nullified; the court still has jurisdiction but chooses to exercise its discretion not to proceed.

Option G says courts will always refuse jurisdiction. But I think it's not always; it's a discretionary decision based on the circumstances.

Option H seems to fit because it's about abuse of process leading to a stay.

So, the correct answer should be H.

The question concerns whether extra-territorial abduction is a ground for refusing jurisdiction in English courts. Extra-territorial abduction refers to the unlawful removal of a person from another country to face legal proceedings in England. English law addresses this issue under the principle of "abuse of process." 

In the case of *R v. Horseferry Road Magistrates' Court, ex parte Bennett* [1994], the House of Lords ruled that if a defendant is abducted and brought to the UK unlawfully, the court may exercise its discretion to stay the proceedings. This is because such an abduction constitutes an abuse of process, violating international law and the principles of justice. However, the decision to stay proceedings is not automatic; it is discretionary and depends on the specific circumstances of the case.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option H** correctly states that extra-territorial abduction constitutes an abuse of process and may lead to a stay of proceedings, aligning with the *Bennett* case.
- **Option F** is incorrect because the *Bennett* case shows that a stay of proceedings can occur due to the abuse of process.
- **Option E** is incorrect as jurisdiction is not nullified; the court retains jurisdiction but may choose to stay proceedings.
- **Option G** is incorrect because the refusal of jurisdiction is not automatic but discretionary.
- Other options either encourage unlawful conduct, ignore the influence of abduction, or misstate the legal consequences.

Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: H
