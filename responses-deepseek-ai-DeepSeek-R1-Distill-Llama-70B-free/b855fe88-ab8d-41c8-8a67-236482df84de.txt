Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about amino acids, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think through this step by step. The question is asking which of the given options lists amino acids that are all essential components of the diet. 

First, I need to remember which amino acids are essential. Essential amino acids are those that the human body can't synthesize on its own, so they must be obtained from the diet. I recall that there are nine essential amino acids for humans. Let me list them out: histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. Wait, wait, I think that's rightâ€”nine of them.

Now, looking at the options, each one gives three amino acids, and I need to check if all three in a particular option are essential. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: leucine, methionine, and threonine. All three are in my essential list. Leucine is essential, methionine definitely is, and threonine too. So A could be a contender.

Option B: leucine, cysteine, glycine. Leucine is essential, but what about cysteine and glycine? Oh wait, I think cysteine is considered semi-essential or can be synthesized from methionine. Glycine, I believe, is non-essential because the body can make it from other compounds. So B has at least one non-essential, so it's out.

Option C: proline, tyrosine, serine. Hmm. Proline is a non-essential amino acid, right? Because the body can synthesize it. Tyrosine is interesting. I think tyrosine is conditionally essential. Normally, it's made from phenylalanine, which is essential. So if someone can't get phenylalanine, tyrosine becomes essential. But under normal circumstances, it's not required in the diet. Serine is non-essential as well. So C probably isn't the right answer.

Option D: valine, glycine, arginine. Valine is essential, but glycine is non-essential. Arginine is considered semi-essential or conditionally essential, especially in infants. So this option has some non-essentials, so D is out.

Option E: methionine, serine, tyrosine. Methionine is essential, but serine and tyrosine aren't. Both can be synthesized, so E isn't correct.

Option F: isoleucine, alanine, glycine. Isoleucine is essential, but alanine and glycine are not. So F is wrong.

Option G: lysine, tyrosine, cysteine. Lysine is essential. Tyrosine, as before, is not essential unless under certain conditions. Cysteine is semi-essential. So G has at least two that aren't fully essential, so it's out.

Option H: aspartate, valine, threonine. Wait, aspartate isn't one of the essential amino acids. Valine and threonine are essential, but aspartate (aspartic acid) is non-essential. So H isn't correct.

Option I: phenylalanine, arginine, isoleucine. Phenylalanine is essential, isoleucine is essential. What about arginine? I think arginine is semi-essential. So in normal circumstances, it's not required, but under certain conditions (like infancy or stress), it becomes essential. So if the question is about essential components under normal circumstances, arginine isn't. So I's option has two essential and one semi-essential. But the question says 'all essential components', so if all are essential, then this might not fit because arginine isn't always essential.

Wait, but wait another thought: Let me double-check the essential list. The nine are histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. So arginine isn't in that list. So Option I has phenylalanine (essential), arginine (non-essential normally), and isoleucine (essential). So two are essential, and one isn't. So I isn't correct.

Option J: lysine, proline, arginine. Lysine is essential; proline and arginine are not. So J is out.

Wait, going back to Option I: the third amino acid is isoleucine, which is essential. So in I, phenylalanine and isoleucine are essential, arginine is semi-essential. So not all three are essential in the strict sense.

So which options have all three as essential? Let me recap:

Only option A had all three as essential: leucine, methionine, threonine. All three are in the essential list. So the correct answer should be A.

To determine which option lists amino acids that are all essential components of the diet, we need to identify the essential amino acids. There are nine essential amino acids for humans: histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. These cannot be synthesized by the body and must be obtained from the diet.

Now, let us evaluate each option:

- **Option A**: Leucine, methionine, and threonine. All three are essential amino acids. This option is correct.
- **Option B**: Leucine is essential, but cysteine is semi-essential (can be synthesized from methionine), and glycine is non-essential. This option is incorrect.
- **Option C**: Proline is non-essential, tyrosine is conditionally essential (synthesized from phenylalanine), and serine is non-essential. This option is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Valine is essential, but glycine is non-essential, and arginine is semi-essential. This option is incorrect.
- **Option E**: Methionine is essential, but serine is non-essential, and tyrosine is conditionally essential. This option is incorrect.
- **Option F**: Isoleucine is essential, but alanine and glycine are non-essential. This option is incorrect.
- **Option G**: Lysine is essential, but tyrosine is conditionally essential, and cysteine is semi-essential. This option is incorrect.
- **Option H**: Valine and threonine are essential, but aspartate (aspartic acid) is non-essential. This option is incorrect.
- **Option I**: Phenylalanine and isoleucine are essential, but arginine is semi-essential. This option is incorrect.
- **Option J**: Lysine is essential, but proline and arginine are non-essential. This option is incorrect.

The only option where all three amino acids are essential is **Option A**.
