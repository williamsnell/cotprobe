Alright, so I've got this question here about a pro wrestler in the movie Rocky III. I'm not super familiar with all the details, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see... Rocky III came out in the 80s, right? I remember that the Rocky movies are about boxing, but this one might involve a wrestler because the question is about a wrestler in the film.

Wait, I think Rocky III is where Rocky faces a new challenger. I remember there's a scene where he's fighting someone really tough. Wasn't there a wrestler involved? Maybe someone famous from the WWF (now WWE) back then. I'm trying to recall the cast. Sylvester Stallone is Rocky, of course.

Oh, I think Hulk Hogan was in Rocky III. Yeah, that's right! He played a character named Thunderlips, an arrogant wrestler who has a fight against Rocky. I remember the scene where they have a boxing match, but I think it's more of a show or an exhibition. So Hulk Hogan's character is the pro wrestler in the movie.

Looking at the options, J is Hulk Hogan. So the answer should be J.
