Question:

A 37-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 45 minutes after she was found unconscious on her apartment floor. Her coworkers became concerned when she did not arrive for work. On arrival, she is unable to provide a history. Her pulse is 96/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 124/58 mm Hg. Examination shows erythema, warmth, and induration of the upper back, buttocks, and posterior thighs. Her serum creatine kinase activity is 10,300 U/L. Urine toxicology screening is positive for opiates and cocaine. Urine dipstick is strongly positive for blood. Microscopic examination of the urine shows pigmented granular casts and rare erythrocytes. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following conditions over the next 24 hours?

Options:

A: Pulmonary embolism
B: Acute liver failure
C: Myocardial infarction
D: Septic shock
E: Acute respiratory distress syndrome
F: Cerebral edema
G: Cerebral hemorrhage
H: Pancreatitis
I: Acute tubular necrosis

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this medical question. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I get all the details right.

So, there's a 37-year-old woman who was found unconscious on her apartment floor. She came to the emergency department 45 minutes after being found. Her coworkers were worried because she didn't show up for work. On arrival, she can't provide a history, which makes sense because she's unconscious. Her vital signs are pulse 96/min, which is a bit high, respirations 12/min (that's normal), and blood pressure 124/58 mmHg. So the BP isn't super low but the diastolic is on the lower side.

Physical exam shows erythema, warmth, and induration of the upper back, buttocks, and posterior thighs. Hmm, erythema is redness, warmth suggests inflammation or infection, and induration is hardening of tissue. So maybe she's lying on those areas for a long time, causing pressure sores or rhabdomyolysis? Or maybe an infection?

Her serum creatine kinase (CK) activity is 10,300 U/L. That's really high. CK is an enzyme found in the heart, brain, and skeletal muscle. High levels usually indicate muscle damage, like in rhabdomyolysis. So that's probably what's going on here.

Urine toxicology is positive for opiates and cocaine. So she used these drugs recently. Cocaine is a stimulant and can cause vasoconstriction, which might affect blood flow to muscles, leading to ischemia and muscle breakdown. Opiates can cause respiratory depression, but in this case, her respirations are normal. But being unconscious might be due to the drugs.

The urine dipstick is strongly positive for blood, but the microscopic exam shows pigmented granular casts and rare erythrocytes. So the dipstick positive for blood could be because of myoglobinuria. Myoglobin from muscle breakdown can cause the urine to test positive for blood, but when you look under the microscope, you don't see many red blood cells. Instead, there are pigmented casts, which are consistent with acute kidney injury, specifically acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Because when muscles break down, they release myoglobin which can damage the kidneys.

Putting this together, the patient likely has rhabdomyolysis. Rhabdomyolysis can lead to acute kidney injury (ATN) because the myoglobin is toxic to the renal tubules. The question is asking what she's at increased risk for over the next 24 hours.

Looking at the options:

A: Pulmonary embolism. That's possible in immobilized patients but not directly linked here unless she's been lying still for a long time, but her main issue seems to be muscle breakdown.

B: Acute liver failure. She's using cocaine and opiates, which can affect the liver, but her CK is more indicative of muscle issues, and liver failure usually takes longer.

C: Myocardial infarction. Cocaine can cause heart issues, including MI, but she's young and the context here points more to muscle and kidney issues.

D: Septic shock. There's no clear sign of infection mentioned. The erythema and warmth could be from pressure, not infection.

E: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Possible in severe cases, but I'm not sure if that's the immediate risk here.

F: Cerebral edema. Maybe due to hypoxia or other causes, but not directly linked to her current condition.

G: Cerebral hemorrhage. Cocaine can cause this, but again, the main issue is her muscle and kidney situation.

H: Pancreatitis. Not directly related to the given information.

I: Acute tubular necrosis. Yes, because of rhabdomyolysis leading to ATN.

So the patient is at increased risk for acute tubular necrosis over the next 24 hours. The other options don't fit as well with the given data.

The patient is a 37-year-old woman presenting with unconsciousness, tachycardia, and physical examination findings of erythema, warmth, and induration on her upper back, buttocks, and posterior thighs. Her serum creatine kinase (CK) is significantly elevated at 10,300 U/L, indicating muscle damage, likely due to rhabdomyolysis. Urine toxicology is positive for opiates and cocaine, which may have contributed to her condition. The urine dipstick is strongly positive for blood, but microscopic examination reveals pigmented granular casts and rare erythrocytes, suggesting myoglobinuria rather than actual blood in the urine. This is consistent with acute kidney injury (AKI), specifically acute tubular necrosis (ATN), which is a common complication of rhabdomyolysis.

Among the options provided, the patient is at the highest risk for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) over the next 24 hours due to the release of myoglobin from muscle breakdown, which is toxic to the renal tubules. Other conditions, such as pulmonary embolism, acute liver failure, or myocardial infarction, are less directly related to the clinical findings and the acute presentation of rhabdomyolysis.
