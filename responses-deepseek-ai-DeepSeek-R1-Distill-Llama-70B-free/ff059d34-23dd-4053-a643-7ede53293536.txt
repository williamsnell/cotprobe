Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with nozzles and efficiency stuff. But let's try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says air is flowing through a nozzle with 90% efficiency. The expansion rate is 2.0 kg/s. Inlet conditions are P = 550 kPa and T = 680 K. Exit pressure is 120 kPa. I need to find the actual exit area, velocity, and enthalpy. The options are given from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that nozzles are devices where a fluid accelerates, so the velocity increases. Since it's a nozzle, the mass flow rate should remain the same, assuming steady flow. Oh wait, the expansion rate is given as 2.0 kg/s—so that's the mass flow rate, right? So m_dot = 2 kg/s.

First, I think I need to find the exit state, considering the efficiency. Nozzle efficiency is the ratio of actual enthalpy drop to the ideal (isentropic) enthalpy drop. So efficiency η = (h_inlet - h_actual)/(h_inlet - h_exit_isentropic). Or wait, is it the other way around? Oh right, for nozzles, efficiency is (actual work)/(ideal work). Since work in a nozzle is the enthalpy drop, so η = (h_in - h_actual) / (h_in - h_exit_s). So the actual enthalpy drop is less than the ideal, meaning that the actual exit velocity is less than the ideal.

Wait, but maybe I should think about the ideal case first. So assuming isentropic flow, find the exit conditions, then adjust for efficiency.

So for the ideal case, the exit pressure P_exit_s and actual P_exit are the same, right? Because the actual exit pressure can't be higher than the ambient, and here it's given as 120 kPa. So in the ideal case, the exit state is at P_exit_s = 120 kPa.

So I can use the isentropic relations to find the exit temperature and velocity for the ideal case, then correct them with the efficiency.

The specific heat ratio K is given as 1.4, which is typical for air.

I think the steps are:

1. Calculate the stagnation temperatures and Mach numbers for the inlet and exit (ideal case).
2. Find the ideal exit velocity.
3. Use nozzle efficiency to find the actual exit velocity.
4. Use the mass flow rate equation to find the exit area.

Wait, or maybe another approach. Let's think in terms of energy. For a nozzle, the specific energy equation is:

h_in + (V_in)^2 / 2 = h_exit + (V_exit)^2 / 2

But since it's a nozzle, the inlet velocity is usually small compared to the exit, so sometimes V_in is neglected. But perhaps I shouldn't make that assumption unless told otherwise.

Wait, the problem doesn't mention the inlet velocity, so maybe we can assume it's negligible. Hmm, but in that case, the energy equation simplifies to h_in = h_exit + (V_exit^2)/2.

But wait, that's for the actual case. For the ideal case, assuming isentropic, the exit velocity would be higher.

Wait, maybe I should first compute the ideal exit state, then apply efficiency.

So, for the isentropic case, the exit pressure is 120 kPa. Let's find the exit temperature T_exit_s.

We can use the isentropic relation for temperature in terms of pressure:

T_exit_s = T_in * (P_exit / P_in) ^ [(K-1)/K]

Given K=1.4, so (K-1)/K = 0.4/1.4 = 2/7 ≈ 0.2857.

So T_exit_s = 680 K * (120 / 550) ^ 0.2857

Calculating 120/550 = 0.21818.

Now, 0.21818^0.2857. Let me compute that. Hmm, I might need to approximate this. Let's see:

Take natural logs: ln(0.21818) ≈ -1.525.

Multiply by 0.2857: -1.525 * 0.2857 ≈ -0.4357.

Exponentiate: e^(-0.4357) ≈ 0.646.

So T_exit_s ≈ 680 * 0.646 ≈ 439 K.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check that exponent. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for specific heat.

Wait, alternatively, using the relation for enthalpy. Since for air, assuming constant specific heats, h = c_p * T.

So, for the ideal case, the enthalpy at exit is h_exit_s = c_p * T_exit_s.

But what's c_p for air? I think at standard conditions, c_p is about 1005 J/kg·K, or 1.005 kJ/kg·K. But since the values in the options are in kJ/kg, I'll use 1.005 kJ/kg·K.

Wait, so h_in = c_p * T_in = 1.005 * 680 = let's calculate that.

1.005 * 680 = 1.005 * 600 = 603, 1.005 *80 = 80.4 → total 683.4 kJ/kg.

Wait, but that's specific enthalpy at inlet.

Now, for the isentropic case, the exit enthalpy h_exit_s = 1.005 * 439 ≈ 439 *1.005 ≈ let's compute that.

439 *1 =439, 439 *0.005=2.195 → total 441.195 kJ/kg.

So the ideal enthalpy drop is h_in - h_exit_s = 683.4 - 441.195 ≈ 242.205 kJ/kg.

But the actual enthalpy drop is less because the efficiency is 90%. Wait, the efficiency η is the actual enthalpy drop divided by the ideal. So η = (h_in - h_actual)/(h_in - h_exit_s) → 0.9 = (683.4 - h_actual)/(242.205).

So solving for h_actual:

0.9 * 242.205 = 683.4 - h_actual → 217.885 ≈ 683.4 - h_actual → h_actual = 683.4 - 217.885 ≈ 465.515 kJ/kg.

Wait, so the actual exit enthalpy is about 465.5 kJ/kg.

Looking at the options, option D has Enthalpy 465.8 KJ/kg, which is very close. So that gives a hint that the correct answer is D.

But let's not jump to conclusions yet. Let's proceed.

So the actual exit enthalpy is h_actual = 465.5 kJ/kg.

Wait, but we can also compute the exit velocity using the energy equation.

The energy equation for the nozzle is:

h_in + (V_in^2)/2 = h_actual + (V_actual^2)/2.

But if we neglect the inlet velocity (as it's often small), then:

h_in ≈ h_actual + (V_actual^2)/2.

So, solving for V_actual:

V_actual = sqrt(2*(h_in - h_actual)).

But wait, h_in is 683.4 kJ/kg, and h_actual is 465.5 kJ/kg. So their difference is 683.4 -465.5 = 217.9 kJ/kg.

But wait, 1 kJ/kg is 1000 J/kg, so 217.9 *1000 = 217900 J/kg.

So V_actual = sqrt(2 * 217900) = sqrt(435800) ≈ ?

What's the square root of 435800? Let me think. 600^2 is 360000, 700^2 is 490000. So it's between 660 and 660^2=435600.

Wait, 660^2 = 435600. So 435800 is 200 more. So sqrt(435800) ≈ 660 + (200)/(2*660) ) → 200/1320≈0.15. So approximately 660.15 m/s.

Wait, that's 660 m/s. Let me see the options. Option D has a velocity of 658 m/s, which is very close. So that might be the correct option.

But wait, let's make sure about the steps. Alternatively, perhaps the actual exit velocity isn't calculated that way. Because earlier, I thought of the isentropic case and then using efficiency to find the actual velocity. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: for the isentropic case, we can find the exit velocity, then the actual velocity would be lower due to efficiency.

In the isentropic case, the exit velocity can be found using the Stagnation pressure and the exit pressure.

Wait, I remember that the exit velocity for an isentropic nozzle can be calculated using V_exit_s = sqrt(2*(h_in - h_exit_s)).

Which is similar to what I did earlier. So V_exit_s = sqrt(2*(683.4 - 441.195)*1000) → sqrt(2*242205*1000) → wait, no, wait. Wait, 242.205 kJ/kg is 242205 J/kg.

So V_exit_s = sqrt(2 * 242205) = sqrt(484410) ≈ 696 m/s.

Wait, because 696^2 = 484,416, which is close. So the ideal exit velocity is about 696 m/s.

But with 90% efficiency, the actual velocity would be V_actual = η * V_exit_s ? Or is it based on kinetic energy? Wait, the efficiency for nozzles is often defined as the ratio of actual kinetic energy to the ideal kinetic energy.

So η = (KE_actual)/(KE_ideal) → KE_actual = η * KE_ideal.

So KE_ideal is (V_exit_s)^2 / 2, and KE_actual is (V_actual)^2 / 2.

So η = (V_actual^2 / 2) / (V_exit_s^2 / 2) → η = (V_actual / V_exit_s)^2.

So V_actual = V_exit_s * sqrt(η).

So with η=0.9, sqrt(0.9)= approx 0.9487.

So V_actual = 696 * 0.9487 ≈ 696 * 0.9487.

Let me compute that: 696 *0.9 is 626.4, 696 *0.0487≈33.87. So total ≈626.4 +33.87≈660.27 m/s.

Which aligns with the previous calculation of about 660 m/s, and option D has 658 m/s. Close enough.

So now, moving on to find the exit area.

The mass flow rate m_dot = ρ * A * V.

We have m_dot=2 kg/s.

We need to find the actual exit area A. So A = m_dot / (ρ_actual * V_actual).

But to find ρ_actual, we need the actual exit conditions. Since the exit pressure is given as 120 kPa, and the actual exit enthalpy is known, we can find the exit temperature and then use the ideal gas law to find density.

Wait, for the actual exit state, we have P_exit = 120 kPa, h_actual = 465.5 kJ/kg.

But how do we find the temperature T_actual? Well, since h = c_p * T, T_actual = h_actual / c_p = 465500 J/kg / 1005 J/kg·K ≈ let's compute that.

465500 / 1005 → Let me compute 1005 * 463 = let's see, 1005 * 400=402,000. 1005*63=63,315 → total 402,000 +63,315=465,315. So 1005 *463=465,315. The h_actual is 465,500, so 465,500 -465,315=185. So 463 + 185/1005 → 463 + approx 0.184 → 463.184 K.

So T_actual ≈463.2 K.

Now, using ideal gas law, P = ρ R T → ρ = P/(R T).

What's R for air? R = 287 J/kg·K.

So ρ_actual = (120,000 Pa) / (287 J/kg·K * 463.2 K).

Let me compute denominator: 287 *463.2 → 287 *400=114,800; 287 *63.2≈18,154.4 → total ≈114800 +18,154.4=132,954.4.

So ρ_actual ≈120,000 / 132,954.4 ≈0.9027 kg/m³.

Now, the mass flow rate is m_dot = ρ * A * V → A = m_dot / (ρ * V).

We have m_dot=2 kg/s, ρ=0.9027, V=660.15 m/s.

So A = 2 / (0.9027 * 660.15) → compute denominator: 0.9027 *660 ≈ 596.0.

So A ≈2 / 596 → approx 0.00336 m².

Looking at the options, let's check option D: exit area 3.37e-3 m², which is 0.00337 m². Our calculation is 0.00336, which is very close. So that matches.

So the exit area is approximately 3.37e-3 m², velocity is 658 m/s, and enthalpy is about 465.8 KJ/kg, which matches option D.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation for the exit area.

Wait, 0.9027 kg/m³ multiplied by 660 m/s → 0.9027 *660 = ?

Compute 0.9 *660 = 594, 0.0027*660=1.782 → total 595.782. So denominator is 595.782.

So A=2 /595.782 → approx 0.00336 m², which is 3.36e-3 m². Option D has 3.37e-3, which is a close match.

Hence, the correct answer should be option D.

To solve the problem, we analyze the nozzle flow with the given conditions:

1. **Mass Flow Rate**: The expansion rate is given as \( \dot{m} = 2.0 \, \text{kg/s} \).

2. **Inlet Conditions**: The inlet pressure is \( P_{\text{in}} = 550 \, \text{kPa} \) and inlet temperature \( T_{\text{in}} = 680 \, \text{K} \). The specific heat ratio \( K = 1.4 \) and \( c_p = 1.005 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \).

3. **Exit Pressure**: The exit pressure is \( P_{\text{exit}} = 120 \, \text{kPa} \).

4. **Nozzle Efficiency**: The efficiency is \( \eta = 0.9 \).

---

### Step 1: Ideal Exit Conditions (Isentropic Flow)
Using isentropic relations:

\[
T_{\text{exit,s}} = T_{\text{in}} \left( \frac{P_{\text{exit}}}{P_{\text{in}}} \right)^{\frac{K-1}{K}}
\]

Substituting values:

\[
T_{\text{exit,s}} = 680 \left( \frac{120}{550} \right)^{\frac{0.4}{1.4}} = 680 \cdot (0.21818)^{0.2857} \approx 439 \, \text{K}
\]

The ideal exit enthalpy is:

\[
h_{\text{exit,s}} = c_p \cdot T_{\text{exit,s}} = 1.005 \cdot 439 \approx 441.2 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]

The ideal enthalpy drop is:

\[
h_{\text{in}} - h_{\text{exit,s}} = 683.4 - 441.2 = 242.2 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]

Using nozzle efficiency:

\[
\eta = \frac{h_{\text{in}} - h_{\text{actual}}}{h_{\text{in}} - h_{\text{exit,s}}}
\]

Solving for \( h_{\text{actual}} \):

\[
0.9 = \frac{683.4 - h_{\text{actual}}}{242.2} \implies h_{\text{actual}} = 683.4 - 0.9 \cdot 242.2 \approx 465.5 \, \text{kJ/kg}
\]

---

### Step 2: Actual Exit Velocity
Using the energy equation for the nozzle:

\[
h_{\text{in}} = h_{\text{actual}} + \frac{V_{\text{actual}}^2}{2}
\]

Rearranging for \( V_{\text{actual}} \):

\[
V_{\text{actual}} = \sqrt{2 \cdot (h_{\text{in}} - h_{\text{actual}})}
\]

Substituting values:

\[
V_{\text{actual}} = \sqrt{2 \cdot (683.4 - 465.5) \cdot 1000} = \sqrt{2 \cdot 217.9 \cdot 1000} \approx 660 \, \text{m/s}
\]

---

### Step 3: Actual Exit Area
The mass flow rate is related to the exit area by:

\[
\dot{m} = \rho_{\text{actual}} \cdot A \cdot V_{\text{actual}}
\]

The density \( \rho_{\text{actual}} \) is calculated using the ideal gas law:

\[
\rho_{\text{actual}} = \frac{P_{\text{exit}}}{R \cdot T_{\text{actual}}}
\]

Here, \( R = 287 \, \text{J/kg·K} \) and \( T_{\text{actual}} = \frac{h_{\text{actual}}}{c_p} = \frac{465.5}{1.005} \approx 463.2 \, \text{K} \). Substituting:

\[
\rho_{\text{actual}} = \frac{120,000}{287 \cdot 463.2} \approx 0.9027 \, \text{kg/m}^3
\]

Now,
