Okay, so I've got this math problem here about finding the simplest form of a ratio. The question is asking for the ratio of 96 runners to 216 swimmers. Hmm, ratios can sometimes trip me up, but I think I remember that simplifying them involves finding the greatest common divisor or something like that.

Let me start by writing down the ratio as it is. So, 96 to 216. I think that's the same as 96/216. Now, I need to simplify this fraction. To do that, I should find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 96 and 216. 

Wait, how do I find the GCF again? Oh right, one way is to list the factors of each number and find the largest one they have in common. But that might take a while with such big numbers. Alternatively, I remember there's a method using prime factorization. Let me try that.

Breaking down 96 into primes: 96 divided by 2 is 48, divided by 2 again is 24, again to 12, again to 6, and once more to 3. So, 2^5 * 3^1.

Wait, let me double-check that. 2^5 is 32, but 32 times 3 is 96. Oh right, 2^5 * 3.

Now for 216. Let's break it down. 216 divided by 2 is 108, divided by 2 is 54, divided by 2 is 27. So that's three 2s. Then 27 is 3^3. So putting it together, 2^3 * 3^3.

Now, the GCF is the product of the lowest powers of the common primes. So for 2, the lower exponent is 3 (since 96 has 5 and 216 has 3). For 3, the lower exponent is 1 (96 has 1, 216 has 3). So GCF is 2^3 * 3^1. Let's compute that: 8 * 3 is 24. So the GCF is 24.

Wait, that makes sense because 24 is a common factor. Let me check: 96 divided by 24 is 4, and 216 divided by 24 is 9. So 4 and 9. So the simplified ratio is 4:9, or 4 over 9.

Looking back at the options, option H is 4 over 9. So that must be the correct answer. But just to make sure, I'll go through the other options to see if any others could be simplified to the same.

Option A is 16/36. Simplifying that by dividing numerator and denominator by 4 gives 4/9, same as H. Wait, so A is also 4/9? But no, wait, 16/36 reduces to 4/9, so A is equivalent but not in the simplest form. So the question asks for the simplest form, so H would be the correct choice because it's already 4/9.

Wait no, option A is 16/36, which simplifies to 4/9, but the question is asking for the simplest form. So the correct ratio is 4/9, which is option H, not A. So yeah, H is the right choice.

To simplify the ratio of 96 runners to 216 swimmers, we start by expressing it as the fraction 96/216. To reduce this fraction to its simplest form, we find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 96 and 216. 

Using prime factorization:
- 96 = \(2^5 \times 3\)
- 216 = \(2^3 \times 3^3\)

The GCF is the product of the lowest powers of the common prime factors:
- For \(2\), the lowest power is \(2^3\).
- For \(3\), the lowest power is \(3^1\).

Thus, the GCF is \(2^3 \times 3 = 8 \times 3 = 24\).

Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 24:
- \(96 รท 24 = 4\)
- \(216 รท 24 = 9\)

This simplifies the ratio to \(4/9\). Among the given options, the simplest form of the ratio is represented by option H: 4 over 9.
