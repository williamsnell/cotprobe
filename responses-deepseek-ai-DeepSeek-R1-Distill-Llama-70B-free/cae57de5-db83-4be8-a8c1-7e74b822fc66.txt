Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about finding the capacity of a channel using Fano's inequality. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on information theory, but let's see if I can work through this.

The problem says that a train is moving out of the station at a constant velocity, and the received signal energy falls off with time as 1/i². So, each time i increases, the energy is getting weaker, like 1 over i squared. 

The received signal at time i is given by Y_i = (1/i) X_i + Z_i, where Z_i are i.i.d. and drawn from a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1. So, each Z_i is N(0,1), which is standard Gaussian noise.

The transmitter has a constraint on the average power. The constraint is (1/n) sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2(w) ≤ 2 for each w in {1,2,...,2^{nR}}. So, the average power per symbol is at most 2. That's an important constraint because it limits how much the transmitter can send.

The question is asking to use Fano's inequality to find the capacity of this channel. Fano's inequality relates the probability of decoding error to the conditional entropy, which in turn gives a lower bound on the rate. But I'm a bit confused about how Fano's inequality directly gives capacity. Oh wait, Fano's inequality is often used in conjunction with other techniques to bound the capacity.

Let me recall Fano's inequality. It says that H(p) + p log(|Y| - 1) ≥ H(Y|X), where H is the entropy function, p is the probability of error, and |Y| is the size of the output alphabet. But in this case, the output is continuous because it's a Gaussian channel. Hmm, maybe Fano is being used in a different way here, perhaps as part of the converse proof for channel capacity.

Wait, the channel here is a bit unusual. Each time i, the received signal is scaled by 1/i and added to noise. So, the SNR for each symbol is ( (1/i)^2 x_i^2 ) / 1, since the noise variance is 1. But the average power constraint is sum x_i^2 ≤ 2n, so each x_i is bounded in power.

Wait, the SNR for each symbol would be (x_i/(i))^2 / 1. But since the power is constrained, perhaps we can model this as a channel with time-varying SNR. So, each symbol's SNR is (x_i^2)/(i²), but x_i² is part of the sum that averages to 2. 

Wait, so the average power is 2, meaning that the sum of x_i^2 is up to 2n. So, each x_i has an average power of 2. Therefore, the expected value of x_i^2 is 2. So, E[x_i^2] = 2 for all i.

But for each i, the coefficient is 1/i, so the received amplitude for X_i is scaled by 1/i. So, the received SNR for each i is ( (x_i / i )^2 ) / 1. The expected value of (x_i^2) is 2, so the expected received SNR per symbol is 2/(i²). 

Wait, but the SNR varies with i. So, for each symbol i, the SNR is 2/(i²). But since the symbols are sent over n uses, and i ranges from 1 to n, the SNR decreases as i increases.

Hmm, but when calculating channel capacity, each symbol's contribution depends on its SNR. For a Gaussian channel, the capacity per symbol is (1/2) log(1 + SNR). But here, each symbol's SNR is different.

Wait, but wait—this is a memoryless channel, right? Because each Y_i depends only on X_i and Z_i. So, it's a channel with varying SNR per symbol. So the total capacity would be the sum over each symbol's capacity, but wait, no. The capacity is the maximum mutual information over the joint distribution. Wait, maybe each symbol is independent, so the mutual information is the sum of each individual mutual information.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The channel is Y_i = (1/i) X_i + Z_i, where Z_i ~ N(0,1), and X_i is such that (1/n) sum X_i^2 ≤ 2. So, the average power is 2, but each x_i is scaled by 1/i. 

So, for each i, the received SNR is ( (x_i^2) )/(i^2) * 1/(noise variance), but noise variance is 1, so it's (x_i^2)/(i^2). But E[X_i^2] = 2, so the expected SNR for each symbol is 2/(i²). 

Wait, but that's per symbol. So, each symbol's SNR is 2/(i²). So, the capacity for each symbol would be (1/2) log(1 + 2/(i²)) bits per channel use. So, the total capacity over n symbols would be the sum from i=1 to n of (1/2) log(1 + 2/(i²)).

But wait, that's not right, because capacity is in bits per channel use, and n is the block length. So, the total capacity C would be (1/n) sum_{i=1}^n (1/2) log(1 + 2/(i²)).

Wait, but as n becomes large, we can approximate the sum. Because for large n, sum_{i=1}^n 1/(i²) is approximately π²/6. But wait, the sum of 1/i² from i=1 to infinity is π²/6 ≈ 1.6449.

So, the sum (1/n) sum_{i=1}^n (1/2) log(1 + 2/(i²)) would approach zero as n increases because each term is 1/n times something that's roughly log terms. Hmm, but that doesn't make sense because capacity should be positive.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think again. The channel is Y = (1/i) X + Z, with Z ~ N(0,1), and E[X^2] ≤ 2. So, for each symbol, the maximum mutual information is I(X;Y) = (1/2) log(1 + E[(X/(i))²]/1) ) = (1/2) log(1 + E[X²]/(i²)) ). Since E[X²] ≤ 2, the maximum for each symbol is (1/2) log(1 + 2/(i²)).

But when n is large, the sum over i=1 to n of (1/2) log(1 + 2/(i²)) divided by n would approach zero because each term is O(1/i²), and the sum converges to a finite value as n increases, so (1/n) times a convergent sum tends to zero. But that would imply that the capacity is zero, which would be option D. But that seems counterintuitive because the channel isn't completely useless.

Wait, but I'm probably missing something. Because the scaling here is 1/i, so for each symbol, the received power is decreasing as 1/i². So, the early symbols (i=1,2,...) have higher SNR, while the later ones have very low SNR. But as the block length n increases, the number of symbols with significant SNR becomes a smaller fraction of the total.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal strategy is to stop using symbols beyond a certain point, where the SNR becomes too low to be useful. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the capacity is determined by the minimum SNR, but I don't think that's correct.

Wait, another approach: Maybe model the channel as a set of parallel Gaussian channels, each with SNR 2/(i²). Then, the capacity is the sum over each channel's capacity, but since each channel is used once, the total capacity per unit time is the sum divided by n. Hmm, but for large n, this sum would be dominated by the early terms, but each term is (1/2) log(1 + 2/i²). The sum from i=1 to infinity of (1/2) log(1 + 2/i²) converges because 1/i² is summable. Let me compute that sum numerically.

Wait, for i=1: (1/2) log(1+2/1) = (1/2) log(3) ≈ 0.5 * 1.0986 ≈ 0.5493

i=2: (1/2) log(1 + 2/4) = (1/2) log(1.5) ≈ 0.5 * 0.4055 ≈ 0.2027

i=3: (1/2) log(1 + 2/9) = (1/2) log(11/9) ≈ 0.5 * 0.1178 ≈ 0.0589

i=4: (1/2) log(1 + 2/16) = (1/2) log(1.125) ≈ 0.5 * 0.1178 ≈ 0.0589 (Wait, 2/16 is 0.125, so 1.125. ln(1.125) is about 0.1178, so log2(1.125) is 0.1699, so 0.5 * that is ~0.08495)

Wait, maybe I should calculate these terms more accurately.

But regardless, the sum converges because each term is O(1/i²), and the sum of 1/i² converges. So the total sum S = sum_{i=1}^\infty (1/2) log(1 + 2/i²) is a finite number.

Then, the capacity would be S / n as n approaches infinity. But wait, no, that's not correct. Because for each n, the sum is up to n, and then divided by n. So as n approaches infinity, the sum approaches S, and S/n approaches zero. So the capacity per channel use would be zero. That would suggest option D: 0.0.

But that seems odd because even though the later symbols contribute very little, the early ones contribute significantly. But when averaged over n, the contribution diminishes.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's consider the mutual information I(X_i; Y_i) for each symbol. For each i, I(X_i; Y_i) = (1/2) log(1 + (E[X_i^2]/i²)/1) ) = (1/2) log(1 + 2/(i²)). So, each symbol's contribution to the mutual information is (1/2) log(1 + 2/i²).

The total mutual information over n symbols is sum_{i=1}^n (1/2) log(1 + 2/i²). The rate R is then this sum divided by n, so R = (1/n) sum_{i=1}^n (1/2) log(1 + 2/i²).

Now, as n becomes very large, what's the behavior of this sum? The sum from i=1 to n of log(1 + 2/i²) behaves like the integral from 1 to n of log(1 + 2/x²) dx. Let's see, as x becomes large, log(1 + 2/x²) ≈ 2/x² (using the approximation log(1+a) ≈ a for small a). So the integral from 1 to n of 2/x² dx is 2 [ -1/x ] from 1 to n = 2(1 - 1/n) ≈ 2 as n approaches infinity.

Wait, but then the sum sum_{i=1}^n log(1 + 2/i²) ≈ integral from 1 to n of log(1 + 2/x²) dx + some constant. Hmm, but earlier, for large x, log(1 + 2/x²) ~ 2/x², and the sum of 1/x² converges to π²/6, so sum_{i=1}^\infty log(1 + 2/i²) converges to some finite value S. Therefore, as n approaches infinity, the sum approaches S, so R = (1/n) * S approaches zero.

So the capacity would be zero. That would correspond to option D: 0.0.

But wait, that seems counterintuitive. Because even if the SNR for each symbol is going down as 1/i², the early symbols have good enough SNR to send information. But when you average over n, the rate per symbol tends to zero. So for any finite n, the rate is positive, but as n approaches infinity, the rate approaches zero. So the capacity, which is the supremum of achievable rates as n approaches infinity, would be zero.

Hmm, but does Fano's inequality lead us here? Fano's inequality gives a lower bound on the rate based on the error probability and the conditional entropy. So perhaps using Fano, we can bound the achievable rate and show that it tends to zero.

Alternatively, maybe I should model this as a channel where each symbol is transmitted with a certain SNR, and the capacity is the sum of the capacities of each sub-channel. But since each symbol's contribution diminishes as 1/i², the sum converges, so per symbol, the rate goes to zero as n increases.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the optimal way is to only use the first few symbols where the SNR is significant and ignore the rest. For example, if we only use the first M symbols, then as M increases, the sum of their capacities would approach a limit, but since the block length n is going to infinity, M could be a function of n, perhaps M = sqrt(n), such that M² ~ n. Then, the number of symbols used is M, each with SNR ~ 2/(M²), and the total rate would be M * (1/2) log(1 + 2/M²) / n ≈ M * (2/(M²)) / (2 ln 2) ) /n, since for small x, log(1+x) ≈ x / ln 2. So that becomes (M * 2/(M²)) ) / (2 ln 2 n) ) = (2/(M)) / (2 ln 2 n) ) = 1/(M ln 2 n). If M = sqrt(n), then this is 1/(sqrt(n) ln2 n) ) = 1/(n^{3/2} ln2 ), which goes to zero as n approaches infinity. So even with this approach, the rate tends to zero.

So, combining all these thoughts, it seems that the capacity is zero because as the block length n increases, the achievable rate R tends to zero. Therefore, the correct answer would be D: 0.0.

The problem involves a channel where the received signal energy falls off with time as \(1/i^2\), and the received signal at time \(i\) is given by \(Y_i = \frac{1}{i}X_i + Z_i\), where \(Z_i \sim N(0,1)\). The transmitter constraint is \(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 \leq 2\), meaning the average power per symbol is at most 2. The goal is to find the channel capacity using Fano's inequality.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Channel Model**: The received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for each symbol \(i\) is proportional to \((x_i / i)^2 / 1\), where \(x_i\) is the transmitted symbol. Given the power constraint \(E[x_i^2] \leq 2\), the expected SNR for each symbol is \(2 / i^2\).

2. **Capacity Contribution per Symbol**: For a Gaussian channel, the capacity per symbol is \((1/2) \log(1 + \text{SNR})\). Substituting the SNR for this channel, the capacity for symbol \(i\) is \((1/2) \log(1 + 2 / i^2)\).

3. **Total Capacity Over \(n\) Symbols**: The total capacity over \(n\) symbols is the sum of the capacities of all symbols, divided by \(n\) (to express capacity per channel use):
   \[
   R = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{2} \log\left(1 + \frac{2}{i^2}\right).
   \]

4. **Behavior as \(n \to \infty\)**: As \(n\) becomes large, the sum \(\sum_{i=1}^n \log(1 + 2 / i^2)\) converges to a finite value because \(\sum_{i=1}^\infty 1 / i^2\) converges (to \(\pi^2 / 6\)). Therefore, the total capacity \(R\) scales as \((1/n) \times \text{constant}\), which approaches zero as \(n \to \infty\).

5. **Conclusion**: Since the capacity per channel use \(R\) tends to zero as \(n \to \infty\), the channel capacity is zero.

### Final Answer:
The capacity of the channel is **0.0**, corresponding to option **D**.
