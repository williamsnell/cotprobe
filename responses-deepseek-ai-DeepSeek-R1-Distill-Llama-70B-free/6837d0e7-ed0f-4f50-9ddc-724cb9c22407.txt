Okay, so I have this problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. It says, "It takes a machine 12 minutes to fill 200 bottles of soda. At this rate, how many minutes will it take the machine to fill 500 bottles of soda?" The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

Alright, so the first thing I think is, this is a rate problem. I remember that rate is usually something like work done over time, or maybe time per unit of work. Hmm, in this case, the machine is filling bottles, so the rate would probably be bottles per minute or minutes per bottle.

Let me think. The machine takes 12 minutes to fill 200 bottles. So, the rate could be 200 bottles in 12 minutes. To find out how long it takes to fill 500 bottles, I can set up a proportion or find the rate per minute and then multiply.

Wait, maybe it's easier to find out how many bottles the machine fills in one minute. So if it's 200 bottles in 12 minutes, then per minute it's 200 divided by 12. Let me calculate that. 200 divided by 12 is approximately 16.666... So about 16.67 bottles per minute.

Now, if the machine fills 16.67 bottles each minute, how long would it take to fill 500 bottles? Well, time is equal to the number of bottles divided by the rate. So 500 divided by 16.666... Let me do that division. 

Alternatively, maybe it's better to use ratios. If 200 bottles take 12 minutes, then 500 bottles would take X minutes. So setting up the proportion: 200/12 = 500/X. Solving for X would give me the time needed.

Let me write that down as an equation. 200/12 = 500/X. To solve for X, I can cross-multiply. So 200 * X = 12 * 500. Let's calculate both sides. 

200 * X = 6000. Then, X = 6000 / 200. 6000 divided by 200 is 30. So X equals 30 minutes. Hmm, so that would mean it takes 30 minutes to fill 500 bottles.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when dealing with proportions, it's easy to mix up which way to set it up. So if 200 bottles take 12 minutes, that's the rate. So for 500 bottles, which is more than 200, the time should be longer than 12, which makes sense. 30 is longer than 12, so that seems right.

Alternatively, I can think in terms of units. The rate is 200 bottles / 12 minutes, which simplifies to 50/3 bottles per minute. Then, time equals amount divided by rate, so 500 / (50/3) = 500 * (3/50) = (500/50)*3 = 10*3 =30 minutes. Yep, same result.

Let me check the answer options. Option E is 30 minutes. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. I remember sometimes these problems can be tricky. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the setup. Is it possible that I should calculate how many minutes per bottle and then multiply by 500? Let's try that approach too.

So, 12 minutes for 200 bottles. So per bottle, it's 12/200 minutes. 12 divided by 200 is 0.06 minutes per bottle. Then, for 500 bottles, it's 500 * 0.06 = 30 minutes. Same answer. Okay, so that confirms it.

I think I'm confident now that the correct answer is 30 minutes, which is option E.

The problem involves determining how long it takes a machine to fill 500 bottles of soda, given that it takes 12 minutes to fill 200 bottles. 

First, calculate the machine's rate. The machine fills 200 bottles in 12 minutes, so its rate is:

\[
\text{Rate} = \frac{200 \, \text{bottles}}{12 \, \text{minutes}} = \frac{50}{3} \, \text{bottles per minute}.
\]

Next, use this rate to find the time required to fill 500 bottles. Time is calculated as:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Number of bottles}}{\text{Rate}} = \frac{500}{\frac{50}{3}} = 500 \times \frac{3}{50} = 30 \, \text{minutes}.
\]

Thus, it will take the machine 30 minutes to fill 500 bottles. The correct answer is:

E: 30 minutes
