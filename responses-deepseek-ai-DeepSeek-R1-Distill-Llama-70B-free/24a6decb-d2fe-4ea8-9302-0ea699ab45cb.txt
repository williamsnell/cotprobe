Question:

An entrepreneur from State A decided to sell hot sauce to the public, labeling it ÒBest Hot Sauce.Ó A company incorporated in State B and headquartered in State C sued the entrepreneur in federal court in State C. The complaint sought $50,000 in damages and alleged that the entrepreneur's use of the name ÒBest Hot SauceÓ infringed the company's federal trademark. The entrepreneur filed an answer denying the allegations, and the parties began discovery. Six months later, the entrepreneur moved to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Should the court grant the entrepreneur's motion?

Options:

A: Yes, because although there is diversity, the amount in controversy is not satisfied.
B: No, because the entrepreneur waived the right to chal-lenge subject-matter jurisdiction by not raising the issue initially by motion or in the answer.
C: No, because the company's headquarters are in the same state as the court.
D: Yes, because the complaint is about a product, not a legal matter.
E: No, because the entrepreneur's product is being sold to the public.
F: No, because the entrepreneur has been participating in the case for six months.
G: Yes, because the entrepreneur is not from the same state as the company.
H: Yes, because the entrepreneur is not a resident of the state where the court is located.
I: No, because the company's claim arises under federal law.
J: Yes, because although the claim arises under federal law, the amount in controversy is not satisfied.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about subject-matter jurisdiction. Let me break it down step by step.

The question is about a lawsuit where an entrepreneur from State A is being sued by a company incorporated in State B and headquartered in State C. The company sued in federal court in State C. The claim is about trademark infringement, and they're seeking $50,000 in damages.

The entrepreneur filed an answer and they went through discovery for six months. Then, the entrepreneur moved to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. The question is whether the court should grant that motion.

So, first, I need to remember how subject-matter jurisdiction works in federal courts. Federal courts can hear cases under two main types of jurisdiction: diversity jurisdiction and federal question jurisdiction.

Diversity jurisdiction requires that the parties are citizens of different states and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. Federal question jurisdiction applies when the case involves a federal issue, like a claim under federal law.

Here, the complaint is about federal trademark infringement, which is a federal question. So the court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331. That means the court doesn't need to rely on diversity; the federal question is enough.

But wait, the entrepreneur is moving to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. So I need to see if there's any reason why the court wouldn't have jurisdiction.

Looking at the options, option I says no because the company's claim arises under federal law. That makes sense because federal question jurisdiction exists here. So the court should have jurisdiction regardless of the amount in controversy, right? Wait, no, because for federal question cases, there's no amount requirement. Unlike diversity, which needs over $75k, federal question cases can have any amount. So even if the damages are $50k, as here, the court can still hear it under federal question jurisdiction.

Wait, but looking at the answer choices, option I is about federal law, so that would mean the court has jurisdiction, so the motion should not be granted. Let me check the other options.

Option A: Yes, because diversity isn't met. But wait, the case is based on federal question, so diversity isn't necessary. So A is incorrect.

Option B: No, because the entrepreneur waived the challenge. Wait, subject-matter jurisdiction can be raised at any time, even on appeal. So the entrepreneur didn't waive it by not raising it earlier. So B is incorrect.

Option G: Yes, because they're not from the same state. But again, since it's a federal question, diversity isn't the basis. So G is wrong.

Option J: Yes, because the amount isn't met. But in federal question cases, the amount doesn't matter. So J is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be I: No, because the claim arises under federal law. Therefore, the court has subject-matter jurisdiction, and the motion to dismiss should be denied.

The court should deny the entrepreneur's motion to dismiss because the case involves a federal trademark infringement claim, which falls under federal question jurisdiction. Federal courts have jurisdiction over such cases regardless of the amount in controversy. 

Answer: I
