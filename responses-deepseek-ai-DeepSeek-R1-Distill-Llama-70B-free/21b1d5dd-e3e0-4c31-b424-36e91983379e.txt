Alright, let's tackle this physics problem. Okay, so I have a sonar device emitting waves. The frequency given is 40,000 cycles per second, which is 40 kHz. Hmm, right, that's the frequency in air, I think. Because when the question mentions the velocities in air and water, the frequency probably stays the same when the medium changes, only the wavelength changes. So the frequency in air is 40,000 Hz.

Next, I need to find the wavelengths in air and water. Oh wait, the formula I remember is wavelength equals velocity divided by frequency. Yeah, λ = v/f. So for air, velocity is 1100 ft/s. Let me calculate that. 1100 divided by 40,000. Let me do the math: 1100 / 40000 equals 0.0275 feet. Wait, how do I express that in scientific notation? Oh right, 2.75e-2 ft. So wavelength in air is 2.75 × 10^-2 ft.

Now, for water, the velocity is 4200 ft/s. Using the same formula, 4200 divided by 40,000. Let's see: 4200 / 40000 is 0.105. So that's 1.05e-1 ft, or 1.05 × 10^-1 ft. Wait, but looking at the options, some have 9e-2 which is 0.09. Hmm, did I do that right? Let me recalculate. Oh wait, 4200 divided by 40,000 is indeed 0.105, which is 1.05e-1 ft. But wait, maybe I made a mistake... No, 4200 ÷ 40,000 equals 0.105, yeah, that's correct.

Wait a second, but none of the options seem to have 0.105 as the wavelength in water. Let me look at the options. Oh wait, option G says wavelength in water is 10.5e-2, which is 0.105, right? Because 10.5e-2 is 0.105. So that matches.

Wait, but another option, option A has 9.00e-2, which is 0.09. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong. Let me check again: 4200 divided by 40,000. 4200 / 40,000. Let me compute that as (4200 / 1000) / (40,000 / 1000) ) which is 4.2 /40 = 0.105. So yes, 0.105 ft is correct, which is 1.05e-1, or 10.5e-2 ft. So that's option G.

Wait, but let me check all the options. Option E has wavelength in water as 12e-2, which is 0.12. No, that's not matching. Option A has 9e-2. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about if the frequency changes. Wait, no, the frequency should remain the same because it's the same wave. The medium changes, so velocity and wavelength change, but frequency remains the same. So the frequency in air is definitely 40,000 Hz.

Now, the next part is the echo. The sonar emits a signal, and the echo returns after 0.8 seconds. The device is fixed to the ship's bottom, so the sound travels down to the ocean bed and back. So the time is for the round trip.

So the total time is 0.8 seconds. That means the time down is 0.4 seconds, and the time back is another 0.4 seconds. Wait, no, actually, the total distance is D (depth) for going down and another D for coming back, so the total distance is 2D.

But wait, the velocity in water is 4200 ft/s, right? Because the wave is traveling through water when it's going down and coming back. So the total distance is 2D = velocity × time. So 2D = 4200 ft/s * 0.8 s. Let me compute that: 4200 * 0.8 = 3360 ft. So 2D = 3360, so D = 1680 ft. Oh, so the ocean depth is 1680 ft.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option G has the ocean depth as 1680 ft. So that matches.

Now, looking at the options, option G's details are:

Frequency in air: 40,000 cycles/s (matches),

Wavelength in air: 2.75e-2 ft (matches),

Wavelength in water: 10.5e-2 ft (which is 0.105 ft, correct),

Ocean depth: 1680 ft (which is what I calculated).

So option G would be the correct choice.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me recalculate the wavelengths:

In air: v_air = 1100 ft/s, f =40,000 Hz.

λ_air = v/f = 1100 / 40000 = 0.0275 ft. That's 2.75e-2 ft. Correct.

In water: λ_water = 4200 / 40000 = 0.105 ft → 1.05e-1 ft or 10.5e-2 ft. So correct.

Echo time: 0.8 s round trip. So distance down and back is 4200 * 0.8 = 3360 ft. Depth D is half of that, so 3360 / 2 = 1680 ft. So depth 1680 ft.

Looking back at the options, option G matches all these values. So the answer should be option G.

To solve the problem, we analyze the given data and apply the relevant physics principles:

1. **Frequency in Air**: The frequency of the wave remains constant at 40,000 cycles/s, as frequency does not change when the medium changes. This matches the given frequency in air.

2. **Wavelength in Air**: Using the formula \( \lambda = \frac{v}{f} \), where \( v \) is the velocity of the wave in air (1100 ft/s) and \( f \) is the frequency (40,000 Hz):
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{air}} = \frac{1100}{40,000} = 0.0275 \, \text{ft} = 2.75 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{ft}.
   \]

3. **Wavelength in Water**: Again using \( \lambda = \frac{v}{f} \), where \( v \) is the velocity of the wave in water (4200 ft/s) and \( f \) is the frequency (40,000 Hz):
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{water}} = \frac{4200}{40,000} = 0.105 \, \text{ft} = 1.05 \times 10^{-1} \, \text{ft} = 10.5 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{ft}.
   \]

4. **Ocean Depth**: The sonar signal travels to the ocean bed and back, taking a total time of 0.8 seconds. The total distance traveled is:
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = v_{\text{water}} \times \text{Total Time} = 4200 \times 0.8 = 3360 \, \text{ft}.
   \]
   Since this is a round trip, the one-way distance (ocean depth) is:
   \[
   \text{Depth} = \frac{3360}{2} = 1680 \, \text{ft}.
   \]

5. **Matching with Options**: Comparing the calculated values with the options:
   - Frequency in air: 40,000 cycles/s (matches).
   - Wavelength in air: \( 2.75 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{ft} \) (matches).
   - Wavelength in water: \( 10.5 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{ft} \) (matches).
   - Ocean depth: 1680 ft (matches).

Thus, the correct answer is **Option G**.
