Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out how much farther I walked my dog in the morning compared to the afternoon. Let me try to break this down step by step.

So, the problem says I walked 7 over 9 miles in the morning and 5 over 12 miles in the afternoon. I need to find the difference between these two distances to see how much farther the morning walk was.

First, I remember that to subtract fractions, they need to have the same denominator. Right now, the denominators are 9 and 12. I need to find a common denominator for these two. The least common denominator would be the least common multiple of 9 and 12. Let me think, 9 times 12 is 108, but maybe there's a smaller number. Hmm, wait, 9 factors into 3² and 12 into 2²×3. So the LCM would be 2²×3² which is 4×9=36. Oh wait, 36 is the LCD because 36 is divisible by both 9 and 12.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake. Because 9 goes into 36 four times, and 12 goes into 36 three times. So yes, 36 is the LCD.

So I need to convert both fractions to have 36 as the denominator.

Starting with 7/9: To get from 9 to 36, I multiply the denominator by 4. So I have to do the same to the numerator. 7 times 4 is 28. So 7/9 is equivalent to 28/36.

Next, 5/12: To get from 12 to 36, I multiply the denominator by 3. So the numerator becomes 5 times 3, which is 15. So 5/12 is 15/36.

Now, I subtract the afternoon distance from the morning distance. So 28/36 minus 15/36. Since the denominators are the same, I just subtract the numerators: 28 -15 equals 13. So the difference is 13/36 miles.

Looking at the options, option G is 13/36. So that must be the correct answer.

To determine how much farther the morning walk was compared to the afternoon, subtract the afternoon distance from the morning distance. 

1. Convert both fractions to have a common denominator. The least common denominator of 9 and 12 is 36.  
   - \( \frac{7}{9} = \frac{28}{36} \)  
   - \( \frac{5}{12} = \frac{15}{36} \)  

2. Subtract the fractions:  
   \( \frac{28}{36} - \frac{15}{36} = \frac{13}{36} \).  

The difference is \( \frac{13}{36} \) miles.  

Answer: G
