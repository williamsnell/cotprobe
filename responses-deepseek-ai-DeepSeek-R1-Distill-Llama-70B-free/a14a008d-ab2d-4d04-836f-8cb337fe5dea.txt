Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about handling medical records and confidentiality. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The scenario is that I'm treating a teenage male who might have neurological issues. I informed his parents and suggested a neurologist evaluation. Later, the neurologist contacts me asking for my progress notes. The question is what should I do next.

I remember that medical records are protected under laws like HIPAA in the US. So, confidentiality is a big deal here. But since the patient is a teenager, I have to think about who has the authority to consent to releasing records. Minors typically have their parents or legal guardians making decisions for them, right?

The options are A through J. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Ask the client's parents to send the records. Hmm, that might not be necessary. I mean, if the neurologist is requesting them, maybe I should handle it directly. Also, the parents might not have the records themselves.

Option B: Ask the neurologist to sign a confidentiality agreement before sending. I don't think that's standard practice. Usually, a release form from the patient (or their guardian) is what's needed, not an agreement from the requester.

Option C: Inform the neurologist that a release signed by the parents is needed. This sounds right. Since the patient is a minor, the parents can authorize the release of information. Without that, I can't just send the records.

Option D: Request the neurologist to get the records from the hospital. Wait, my notes are probably not at the hospital unless I'm affiliated with one. So this might not apply here.

Option E: Send the records with verbal consent. I'm not sure if verbal consent is sufficient. I think a written release is typically required, especially for medical records.

Option F: Refuse to send, citing confidentiality. That might be too strict. The neurologist is part of the treatment team, so sharing might be appropriate with proper authorization.

Option G: Ask the client if he wants to release the records. Since he's a minor, his parents would be the ones to make that decision. So this might not be the correct approach.

Option H: Tell the neurologist the parents need to request the records. That could work, but maybe it's better to handle it by asking for the release directly.

Option I: Send a summary but not the full records. I'm not sure if that's necessary. The question is about whether I can send the records, not how much to send.

Option J: Send the records as requested. Without a release, this would violate confidentiality, so I shouldn't do this.

So putting it all together, the correct action is to inform the neurologist that a release signed by the parents is needed. That's option C.

The correct course of action is to inform the neurologist that a release of information signed by the client's parents is required before sending the records. This ensures compliance with confidentiality laws, as the patient is a minor and parental consent is necessary.

Answer: C
