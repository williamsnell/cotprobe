Question:

A defendant and his friend were down on their luck. They decided they would make some extra cash by robbing the local liquor store. The friend didn't like guns and decided to use a toy gun, which looked like a real gun, but only shot water. The defendant was aware that the gun was not real. Their plan fixed, they walked into the liquor store late one afternoon when few customers were in the store. The friend produced the toy pistol and pointed it at the customers and the clerk. The defendant ordered everyone to the floor, and the clerk began to rummage behind the counter for the key to the register. While his head was ducked, the clerk pulled a shotgun from behind the counter and fired it at the defendant and his friend. The defendant dived to the side, but his friend was shot and killed. If the defendant is subsequently charged with his friend's death he should be found

Options:

A: guilty of felony murder.
B: not guilty, because the clerk was justified in killing the friend.
C: not guilty, because the defendant did not intend to kill his friend.
D: guilty, because a felon may be convicted of the murder of a co-felon.
E: guilty of involuntary manslaughter.
F: guilty of second degree murder.
G: guilty of voluntary manslaughter.
H: guilty of first degree murder.
I: guilty, because the defendant was involved in the commission of a felony when his friend was killed.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question. Let me read it carefully.

So, the situation is that a defendant and his friend planned to rob a liquor store. The friend didn't like real guns, so he used a toy gun that looked real but only shot water. The defendant knew it wasn't a real gun. They went into the store, the friend pointed the toy gun at people, and the defendant ordered everyone to the floor. The clerk, while ducking, got a shotgun and fired, killing the friend. Now, the defendant is charged with his friend's death. The question is, what's the correct verdict?

I need to think about the legal principles here. I remember that felony murder is a doctrine where a person can be held liable for a murder that occurs during the commission of a felony, even if they didn't intend for the killing to happen. But there's also the idea that this applies even if the killing was done by a third party, like a bystander or victim, as long as it's a foreseeable consequence of the felony.

Wait, but wait. I think there's an exception when the killing is done by a law enforcement officer or someone acting in self-defense. So, if the clerk was justified in using deadly force, maybe that affects the felony murder charge.

So in this case, the friend was using a toy gun that looked real. So from the clerk's perspective, it would seem like a real robbery with a real gun. The clerk might have reasonably feared for his life or others' lives, so he might have been justified in using deadly force.

But for felony murder, the key is that the death occurs during the commission of a felony, and the defendant was part of that felony. But if the clerk was justified, then the killing isn't considered murder, but justifiable homicide. So does that mean the defendant can't be guilty of felony murder because the killing wasn't unlawful?

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Some jurisdictions have the felony murder rule where any death during a felony can lead to murder charges, but others have limitations, like the "merger rule" which excludes deaths caused by the victim or police. Or maybe it's the idea that the clerk's action was a lawful response, so the death isn't part of the felony murder.

Alternatively, I remember something called the "felony murder doctrine" where if a co-felon is killed during the commission of the felony, the other felon can be held liable. Like, for example, if two people rob a store and the police shoot and kill one robber, the other robber can be charged with felony murder.

But wait, in this case, the clerk isn't a police officer, just a regular person. So does the same rule apply? I think it does because the doctrine can apply regardless of who the killer is, as long as the killing is a direct result of the felony.

But another angle: The friend used a toy gun, but the defendant knew it was fake. So when the friend pointed it, the clerk might have had a reasonable belief that it was real, thus acting in self-defense. So the clerk's action was lawful, meaning the friend's death was legally justified.

If the clerk's action is justified, then the death isn't murder. So, can the defendant be guilty of felony murder in that case? I think that depends on whether the killing was unlawful. If the clerk was justified, then the killing isn't unlawful, so felony murder wouldn't apply. Because felony murder requires that the death be a murder, which is unlawful killing.

So, if the clerk's act was lawful, then the death isn't a murder, so the defendant can't be guilty of felony murder.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Some jurisdictions might say that regardless of the justification, if the death occurred during the felony, the defendant is guilty. But I think the majority rule is that if the killing was justified, then it's not murder, so felony murder doesn't apply.

Alternatively, maybe the defendant can be guilty under a different theory, like involuntary manslaughter, if their actions were reckless or negligent and caused the death, even if it was an accident.

Let's look at the options:

A: guilty of felony murder. Possibly, but depends on the clerk's justification.

B: not guilty because clerk was justified. That could be possible if the clerk's action negates the felony murder charge.

C: not guilty because no intent to kill. But felony murder doesn't require intent, so this might not apply.

D: guilty because a felon can be convicted of a co-felon's murder. This is the felony murder idea, but again, depends on if the killing was justifiable.

E: guilty of involuntary manslaughter. Maybe, if the death was due to criminal negligence.

I think the key here is whether the clerk was justified in shooting. If yes, then the killing isn't murder, so the defendant can't be guilty of felony murder. But if the clerk wasn't justified, then felony murder applies.

Wait, but the friend had a toy gun. So the clerk saw what looked like a real gun being pointed at him. From his perspective, he might have reasonably believed there was an imminent threat of death or serious harm, so his use of deadly force was justified. But wait, in some states, the use of deadly force in self-defense requires an actual threat. If the gun was fake, but the clerk didn't know that, he might still be justified.

So, if the clerk's actions were lawful, then the death isn't a murder. Therefore, the defendant can't be guilty of felony murder because that requires an unlawful killing.

But wait, another point: Was the clerk a willing participant? No, he was a victim. So, the defendant and friend were committing a robbery, which is a felony. The clerk, acting in self-defense, killed the friend. Since the clerk's action was lawful, the death isn't a murder. Therefore, the defendant can't be guilty of felony murder because the killing wasn't a murder.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Felony murder applies when a death occurs during a felony, regardless of who causes it, as long as it's a natural and probable consequence. But if the killing is justified, then it's not a murder, so felony murder wouldn't apply. So in this case, since the clerk was justified, the friend's death isn't murder, so the defendant can't be guilty of felony murder.

So, looking at the options, option B says "not guilty, because the clerk was justified in killing the friend." That would make sense if the clerk's justification means the killing wasn't a murder, so the defendant isn't guilty of felony murder.

But wait, I think some jurisdictions have a different approach. There's the idea that if the victim (or someone else) kills a co-felon, the other felon can still be guilty of felony murder. Because the co-felon's actions created the situation that led to the death. But I think that's more about the merger rule, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think again about the felony murder rule. It's typically when a death occurs during the commission of a felony, and the defendant is part of that felony. The key is whether the killing was done by someone else, like a co-felon, a bystander, or the victim.

In this case, the clerk is the victim, so if the clerk's actions were justified, then the death is not a murder, so the defendant can't be guilty of felony murder. But if the clerk's actions were not justified, then the death is a murder, and the defendant is guilty under felony murder.

So, the question is, was the clerk justified in shooting?

The friend pointed a toy gun that looked real. The clerk, in the heat of the moment, might have reasonably believed that the gun was real and that there was an imminent threat. So, the clerk's use of force would be justified under self-defense or defense of others.

Therefore, the clerk's action was lawful, so the killing isn't a murder. Thus, the defendant can't be guilty of felony murder, because that requires the death to be a murder, which it's not in this case.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option D says "guilty, because a felon may be convicted of the murder of a co-felon." That's the idea that if a co-felon dies during the commission, the other is guilty, regardless of who did the killing.

But I think that's only if the killing was unlawful. If the clerk was justified, then the co-felon's death is lawful, so the defendant isn't guilty of murder.

Alternatively, if the clerk's action was not justified, then it's murder, and the defendant is guilty of felony murder.

So, the key is whether the clerk's action was justified.

In many jurisdictions, a business owner can use deadly force if they reasonably believe it's necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm during a robbery.

In this case, the friend pointed a toy gun that looked real, so the clerk's belief that he was in danger was reasonable. Thus, the clerk was justified, so the killing isn't murder.

Therefore, the defendant can't be guilty of felony murder because the killing wasn't a murder.

Looking at the options, option B says "not guilty, because the clerk was justified in killing the friend." That would apply here.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because some sources say that the felony murder rule applies even if the killing was done by a third party, including the victim, as long as it's a foreseeable result of the felony.

Wait, let me think again. The felony murder rule can apply when a death occurs during a felony, even if the killer was someone else, like a co-felon or a victim. But the key is whether the killing was a foreseeable result of the felony.

But if the clerk's action was justified, then the killing isn't a murder, so the felony murder rule doesn't apply. Because felony murder requires that the death be a murder, which is an unlawful killing.

So, if the clerk's killing was lawful, then it's not a murder, so the defendant isn't guilty of felony murder.

So, the correct answer would be option B: not guilty, because the clerk was justified.

But wait, I'm seeing conflicting information. Some sources say that the felony murder rule applies regardless of whether the killing was justified or not, because the focus is on the defendant's actions in committing the felony, not on whether the killer was justified.

Hmm, this is confusing. Let me try to find a clear approach.

The felony murder rule holds that if a death occurs during the commission of a felony, the felon can be guilty of murder, regardless of intent. But this applies when the death is a result of the felony and is a natural and probable consequence.

However, if the death is caused by a third party, like a victim, the rule applies only if the victim's actions were a foreseeable consequence of the felony. But if the victim's actions were justified, then the killing isn't a murder, so the felony murder rule wouldn't apply.

Wait, but I'm getting more confused. Let me look for a case example. For instance, in People v. Knoller, the California Supreme Court held that a defendant could be guilty of murder under the felony murder rule even if the killing was done by a co-felon. But that's when the co-felon is acting in a way that's part of the felony.

In another case, if a store clerk shoots a robber, and that's a justified act, then the robber's death isn't murder, so the other robber can't be guilty of felony murder for that death.

So, in our case, the clerk was justified, so the friend's death isn't a murder. Therefore, the defendant isn't guilty of felony murder.

So, the answer would be option B.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option B is "not guilty, because the clerk was justified in killing the friend."

Alternatively, option D says "guilty, because a felon may be convicted of the murder of a co-felon." That would apply if the clerk's action wasn't justified, but in our case, the clerk was justified.

So, I think the correct answer is B.

The defendant and his friend attempted to rob a liquor store, with the friend using a toy gun that looked real. The clerk, believing the gun was real, shot and killed the friend. The question is whether the defendant can be held liable for his friend's death.

The key legal issue is the application of the felony murder rule, which holds that a defendant can be guilty of murder if a death occurs during the commission of a felony, regardless of intent. However, for felony murder to apply, the killing must be unlawful. If the clerk's actions were justified (e.g., in self-defense), the killing is not unlawful, and felony murder does not apply.

In this case, the friend used a toy gun that looked real, creating a situation where the clerk could reasonably believe there was an imminent threat of harm. This reasonable belief would justify the clerk's use of deadly force under self-defense principles. Since the clerk's actions were lawful, the friend's death is not considered murder. Therefore, the defendant cannot be guilty of felony murder because the killing was not unlawful.

Option B correctly reflects this reasoning: "not guilty, because the clerk was justified in killing the friend." Other options, such as those suggesting guilt under felony murder or other homicide charges, do not account for the clerk's justification, which negates the unlawful nature of the killing required for felony murder.
