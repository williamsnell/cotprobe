Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The point (3,6) is on the graph of y = g(x). So that means when x is 3, y is 6. So g(3) equals 6, right?

Then h(x) is defined as (g(x)) squared for all x. So h(x) = [g(x)]². I'm supposed to find a point that must be on the graph of y = h(x) and then find the sum of the coordinates of that point.

Wait, so since h(x) depends on g(x), and we know a specific value of g(x) at x=3, we can find h(3) using that.

So let's plug in x=3 into h(x). h(3) = [g(3)]². We know g(3) is 6, so h(3) is 6 squared, which is 36.

So the point on the graph of y=h(x) would be (3, 36). Now, the question asks for the sum of the coordinates of that point. So that's 3 plus 36, which equals 39.

Looking at the options, option C is 39. So the answer should be C.

Wait, let me double-check. Did I make any mistakes here? g(3)=6, so h(3)=6²=36. Point is (3,36), sum is 3+36=39. Yep, that seems right.
</think>

The point \((3, 6)\) is on the graph of \(y = g(x)\), meaning \(g(3) = 6\). Since \(h(x) = (g(x))^2\), substituting \(x = 3\) gives \(h(3) = (g(3))^2 = 6^2 = 36\). Therefore, the point \((3, 36)\) must be on the graph of \(y = h(x)\). The sum of the coordinates of this point is \(3 + 36 = 39\).

The correct answer is **C**.

C
