Okay, so I need to find the rate of inventory turnover for Kane's Record Store. Hmm, I remember that inventory turnover is a measure of how many times a company sells and replaces its inventory in a given period. But wait, what's the exact formula again?

Oh right, I think the formula is Cost of Goods Sold divided by the average inventory. Or was it something else? Wait, another thoughtâ€”sometimes they use ending inventory as a proxy if average inventory isn't known. Or maybe the formula is just sales divided by average inventory, but I'm a bit confused now.

Let me think. The question gives me beginning inventory, purchases, and ending inventory. Oh, right, so to find the cost of goods sold, I probably need to calculate it first. Because without COGS, I can't find the turnover rate.

So, the formula for COGS is typically: Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory. Yeah, that makes sense because you add what you had at the start plus what you bought, and then subtract what's left at the end to get what you sold.

Let me plug in the numbers. Beginning inventory is $16,000, purchases are $58,000, and ending inventory is $14,000. So COGS would be 16,000 + 58,000 minus 14,000. Let me calculate that: 16k +58k is 74k, minus 14k is 60k. So COGS is $60,000.

Now, the inventory turnover is COGS divided by average inventory. Wait, or is it divided by ending inventory? I'm a bit mixed up. Oh wait, no, average inventory is (beginning + ending)/2. So average inventory would be (16k +14k)/2. Let me compute that: 30k divided by 2 is 15k. So average inventory is $15,000.

So then, inventory turnover rate is COGS ($60,000) divided by average inventory ($15,000). 60k /15k is 4. So the rate is 4 times. Looking at the options, option A is 4 times. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but sometimes I've heard that some people just use ending inventory instead of average. Let me check what would happen if I did that. COGS is 60k, ending inventory is 14k. 60/14 is about 4.285... which is roughly 4.29, but that's not an option here. So probably the correct approach is to use average inventory, so the answer is 4 times.

To calculate the rate of inventory turnover for Kane's Record Store, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Inventory Turnover} = \frac{\text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}}{\text{Average Inventory}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate COGS
COGS is determined as:

\[
\text{COGS} = \text{Beginning Inventory} + \text{Purchases} - \text{Ending Inventory}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{COGS} = \$16,000 + \$58,000 - \$14,000 = \$60,000
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Average Inventory
Average inventory is calculated as:

\[
\text{Average Inventory} = \frac{\text{Beginning Inventory} + \text{Ending Inventory}}{2}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{Average Inventory} = \frac{\$16,000 + \$14,000}{2} = \$15,000
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Inventory Turnover
Using the formula for inventory turnover:

\[
\text{Inventory Turnover} = \frac{\$60,000}{\$15,000} = 4 \text{ times}
\]

### Conclusion
The inventory turnover rate for Kane's Record Store is **4 times**, which corresponds to option **A**.
