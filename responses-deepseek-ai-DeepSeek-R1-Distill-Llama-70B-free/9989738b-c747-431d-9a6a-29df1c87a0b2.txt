Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a conducting sphere and finding the net charge on it. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, the question says it's a uniformly charged conducting sphere with a diameter of 1.2 meters. The surface charge density is 8.1 microcoulombs per square meter. I need to find the net charge. Oh right, I remember that charge on a conductor resides entirely on the surface, so the charge distribution is uniform here.

Wait, surface charge density (σ) is given by the charge (Q) divided by the surface area (A). So the formula should be σ = Q/A. Oh right, I can rearrange this to solve for Q: Q = σ * A.

But wait, the sphere is a conductor, so the charge is on the surface. So calculating the surface area is key here. The sphere is perfectly symmetrical, so the surface area of a sphere is 4πr². Oh, right, the radius is half the diameter, so diameter is 1.2 m, so radius r is 0.6 m.

Let me compute the surface area first. Plugging in the radius: A = 4 * π * (0.6)^2. Let's calculate that. 0.6 squared is 0.36. So 4 * π * 0.36. 4 * 0.36 is 1.44, so A = 1.44 * π. I can leave it in terms of π for now.

Now, the surface charge density σ is 8.1 μC/m². So Q is σ multiplied by A. So Q = 8.1e-6 C/m² * 1.44π m². Wait, let me compute that. 8.1 multiplied by 1.44.

Let me do 8 * 1.44 first. 8 * 1 is 8, 8 * 0.44 is 3.52, so together that's 11.52. Then 0.1 * 1.44 is 0.144. So 8.1 * 1.44 is 11.52 + 0.144 = 11.664. So that's 11.664, but remember the π?

So Q = 11.664 * π μC. Wait, because σ is in μC/m², so when multiplied by m², the units become μC. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. σ is 8.1 μC/m², A is in m², so when you multiply, μC/m² * m² = μC. So my Q is 11.664 * π microcoulombs.

Wait, but π is approximately 3.1416. So 11.664 multiplied by 3.1416. Let me calculate that.

11 * 3.1416 is about 34.5576. 0.664 * 3.1416. Let's compute that. 0.6 * 3.1416 is 1.88496. 0.064 * 3.1416 is approximately 0.20106. So adding those: 1.88496 + 0.20106 = 2.08602. So total is 34.5576 + 2.08602 = 36.6436, roughly 36.64 microcoulombs.

Wait, but wait a second, let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake. Let me redo the multiplication more accurately.

So 8.1 * 1.44: 8 * 1.44 is 11.52, 0.1 *1.44=0.144. So 11.52 +0.144=11.664. So 11.664 * π. Let's use more precise steps. π is about 3.14159265.

So 11.664 * 3 = 34.992, 11.664 *0.14159265. Let's compute 11.664 * 0.1 is 1.1664, 11.664 *0.04 is 0.46656, 11.664 *0.00159265 is approximately 0.01856. Adding those: 1.1664 + 0.46656 = 1.63296 + 0.01856 ≈ 1.65152.

So total is 34.992 +1.65152=36.64352 microcoulombs. So approximately 36.64 μC.

Looking at the options, option B is 37 μC, which is the closest. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the surface area.

Wait, the diameter is 1.2 m, so radius is 0.6 m. Surface area of a sphere is 4πr², so 4 * π * (0.6)^2. 0.6 squared is 0.36. 4 * 0.36 is 1.44. So yes, 1.44 π m². So that part's correct.

Then 8.1 μC/m² * 1.44π m². So 8.1 *1.44 = 11.664. So 11.664 * π. Let me compute it again with more precision.

11.664 * 3.1416. Let's break it down:

11.664 * 3 = 34.992

11.664 * 0.1416 = ?

Compute 11.664 * 0.1 = 1.1664

11.664 * 0.04 = 0.46656

11.664 * 0.0016 = approx 0.0186624

Adding those: 1.1664 + 0.46656 = 1.63296 + 0.0186624 ≈ 1.6516224.

So total is 34.992 +1.6516224=36.6436224 μC. Approximately 36.64, which is about 36.6 microcoulombs, so the closest option is 37 μC, which is option B.

Wait, but let me check: did I miss anything? Oh, wait, sometimes in these problems, people make mistakes with diameter vs radius. Let me double-check that.

Diameter is 1.2 m, so radius is 0.6 m. So A = 4π(0.6)^2 = 4π*0.36=1.44π. Correct.

So the charge is 8.1 * 1.44π. So 8.1 *1.44=11.664. So 11.664 * π. Let me compute it numerically:

π is approximately 3.1416.

11.664 * 3 = 34.992

11.664 * 0.1416 = 1.65162 (as before)

So 34.992 + 1.65162 = 36.64362 μC. So approximately 36.64 μC.

Looking at the options, the closest is B:37 μC. But wait, another thought: perhaps I should carry more precise calculations or use exact fractions.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. Let's compute 11.664 multiplied by π.

11.664 * π = ?

Using a calculator would help, but since I don't have one, I can compute it as:

π = 3.1415926535

11.664 *3 =34.992

11.664 *0.1415926535 = Let's compute 11.664 * 0.1 =1.1664; 11.664 *0.04=0.46656; 11.664 *0.0015926535= approx 0.01856.

Adding these: 1.1664+0.46656=1.63296 +0.01856=1.65152.

So total is 34.992 +1.65152=36.64352 μC.

So it's about 36.64 μC. The options are in whole numbers, so 36.64 is approximately 37 μC. So option B is the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me check 8.1 *1.44:

8 *1.44 is indeed 11.52, and 0.1 *1.44 is 0.144, so 11.664. So that's correct.

So the answer should be B:37 μC.

To find the net charge on a uniformly charged conducting sphere, we use the relationship between surface charge density (σ), charge (Q), and surface area (A):  

\[
Q = \sigma \cdot A
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the surface area of the sphere
The sphere has a diameter of \(1.2 \, \mathrm{m}\), so its radius is:  
\[
r = \frac{\text{diameter}}{2} = \frac{1.2}{2} = 0.6 \, \mathrm{m}
\]

The surface area of a sphere is given by:  
\[
A = 4 \pi r^2
\]

Substituting \(r = 0.6 \, \mathrm{m}\):  
\[
A = 4 \pi (0.6)^2 = 4 \pi (0.36) = 1.44 \pi \, \mathrm{m}^2
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the net charge
The surface charge density is given as:  
\[
\sigma = 8.1 \, \mu \mathrm{C/m}^2
\]

Using \(Q = \sigma \cdot A\):  
\[
Q = 8.1 \cdot 1.44 \pi \, \mu \mathrm{C}
\]

First, calculate \(8.1 \cdot 1.44\):  
\[
8.1 \cdot 1.44 = 11.664
\]

Now multiply by \(\pi \approx 3.1416\):  
\[
Q = 11.664 \cdot 3.1416 \approx 36.64 \, \mu \mathrm{C}
\]

### Step 3: Match the closest option
The calculated charge is approximately \(36.64 \, \mu \mathrm{C}\), which is closest to \(37 \, \mu \mathrm{C}\). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B: \(37 \, \mu \mathrm{C}\)**
