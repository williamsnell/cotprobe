Okay, I need to figure out the maximum amount a home buyer can borrow given their monthly mortgage payment limit. Let's see, the problem says they can spend no more than $800 per month. The interest rate is 9%, and the mortgage term is 20 years. Oh wait, and both the interest and payments are compounded continuously. Hmm, I remember that continuous compounding and continuous payments are a bit different from the standard formulas I've used before.

So, the standard mortgage formula I know is the one for fixed-rate loans, which usually uses the present value of an annuity formula. The formula is something like PV = PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n)/r], where PV is the present value (the loan amount), PMT is the monthly payment, r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of payments. But wait, that's when payments are made monthly and interest is compounded monthly. But in this case, both are continuous, so I probably need to use a different approach.

I think when payments are continuous and interest is compounded continuously, we use calculus, specifically integrating over the term of the loan. The formula for the loan amount when payments are continuous is based on the equation where the present value of all payments equals the loan amount. So the formula should be PV = integral from 0 to T of PMT * e^(-rt) dt, where T is the term in years, r is the annual interest rate, and PMT is the annual payment.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the payments are monthly, but made continuously. So maybe I need to adjust PMT correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the continuous approach uses a different formula. Let me think. Oh right, when dealing with continuous compounding and continuous payments, the present value of the mortgage is calculated using the formula for a continuous annuity. The formula is PV = (PMT/r)(1 - e^(-rT)), where PMT is the annual continuous payment rate.

Wait a second, but wait. The monthly payment here is $800. So since the payments are made monthly, but continuously, I might need to adjust the PMT to an annual rate. Or, alternatively, since the compounding is continuous, the effective rate is a bit different. Hmm, maybe I should convert the annual interest rate to a continuous rate. Wait, no, the interest is already given as 9%, and it's compounded continuously, so r is 0.09 per year.

Wait, but the payment is monthly. So maybe I should convert the monthly payment into an annual continuous payment. Oh, but wait, payments are made continuously, so perhaps the PMT here is the total annual payment, but since the payments are spread out continuously, the formula uses that.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of annual payments. The monthly payment is $800, so annual would be 12 * 800 = $9600 per year. But wait, wait no, because the payments are continuous. So perhaps the formula uses PMT as the continuous payment rate, which could be the annual payment rate. Let me clarify.

The formula for the present value of a continuous annuity (where payments are made continuously over the period) is:

PV = (PMT) * (1 - e^(-r*T)) / r

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The present value is the integral from 0 to T of PMT * e^(-rt) dt. Which would be PMT * [ (1 - e^(-rT)) / r ]

So in this case, PMT is the continuous payment rate per year. But our payment is $800 per month. So to find the annual continuous payment rate, we need to convert $800 per month into a continuous rate.

Wait, no. If the person is paying $800 every month, but in a continuous manner, that would actually be equivalent to paying a continuous rate of (800 per month). But I think I need to convert that into an annual payment rate. So 800 * 12 = 9600 per year, but since payments are spread out continuously, the effective payment per year is 9600.

Wait, no, wait. No, perhaps not. Because in continuous compounding, the payment is spread out over the year, so the present value is calculated using the continuous formula. So perhaps I should first find the equivalent annual continuous payment from the monthly payment.

Wait, let me think differently. The person can afford $800 per month. Since payments are continuous, each month they are effectively paying continuously, so the monthly payment as a continuous rate would be 800 dollars per month. But to find the total annual payment rate, I'd multiply by 12, so 800 * 12 = 9600 per year. But wait, that's the total annual payment, but in the continuous model, the payment is spread out evenly over the year.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the payment as a continuous stream. So the payment per year is 800 * 12, and the payment rate (PMT) is 800*12 per year.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe I should approach it step by step.

The formula for the maximum loan amount (PV) when payments are made continuously is:

PV = (PMT_annual) * [ (1 - e^(-rT)) / r ]

Where:
- PMT_annual is the annual payment amount (if payments were made once a year), but since payments are made monthly, we need to adjust PMT_annual accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about what the monthly payment implies in terms of an annual continuous payment.

Since the payment is $800 per month, and payments are made continuously, each month's $800 is spread out over the month. So over the course of a year, the total payment would be 12 * 800 = $9600. But since each payment is continuous, the present value would be calculated differently.

Wait, no, I think that's not the correct way. Because when payments are continuous, the PV is calculated as the integral of payment rate over time. So perhaps PMT in the formula is the payment per unit time. So if the person pays $800 each month, but continuously, then the monthly payment rate is $800 per month. But since the interest is compounded continuously, we need to express this in annual terms.

So let me think: the payment per year is 12 * 800 = 9600 dollars per year. But since payments are spread out continuously, the payment rate is 9600 per year. So in the formula, PMT_annual would be 9600.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the payment is $800 per month, so the continuous payment rate is 800 per month, which is 800 * 12 = 9600 per year. So the PMT in the formula is 9600.

Wait, but that would make the PV = (9600) * (1 - e^(-0.09*20)) / 0.09

Wait, let me compute that step by step.

First, calculate the exponent: 0.09 * 20 = 1.8, so e^-1.8 is approximately e^-1.8 ≈ 0.1653.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. e^1.8 is about 6.05, so 1/e^1.8 ≈ 0.1653.

So 1 - e^(-1.8) ≈ 1 - 0.1653 = 0.8347.

So (1 - e^(-rT)) / r = 0.8347 / 0.09 ≈ 9.272.

Then, multiplying by PMT_annual (9600): 9600 * 9.272 ≈ let's see, 9600 * 9 = 86400, and 9600 * 0.272 = approx 9600 * 0.25=2400, 9600 * 0.022=211.2 → 2400+211.2=2611.2 → total ≈ 86400 + 2611.2 = 89011.2.

Wait, but that's giving me around $89,011, but looking at the options, option F is 89,034.79, which is very close. But perhaps my approximation of e^-1.8 is off. Let me compute it more precisely.

The value of e^-1.8: Let me recall that ln(6) is approximately 1.7918, so e^1.7918 ≈ 6. So e^1.8 is about 6.05. So 1/6.05 is approximately 0.165289.

So 1 - 0.165289 = 0.834711.

Then, 0.834711 / 0.09 = let's compute 0.834711 ÷ 0.09. 0.834711 * (1/0.09) = approx 9.264567.

So 9600 * 9.264567 = let's compute that.

9600 * 9 = 86400.

9600 * 0.264567 ≈ 9600 * 0.25 = 2400, 9600 * 0.014567 ≈ 9600 * 0.01 = 96, 0.004567 * 9600 ≈ 43.8272. So 2400 + 96 = 2496 + 43.8272 ≈ 2539.8272.

So total PV ≈ 86400 + 2539.8272 = 88939.8272, approximately $88,939.83.

But wait, let me compute this more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact formula with precise exponentials.

Wait, maybe I should use a calculator approach, but since I can't do that right now, perhaps I can adjust.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in determining PMT_annual.

Wait, perhaps the monthly payment is $800, and because the payments are continuous, the effective annual payment is calculated differently. Because in continuous compounding, the payment per month is $800, and each payment is spread out, so the present value of each month's payment is the integral over that month.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should think in terms of monthly payments with continuous compounding. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem states that the interest is compounded continuously and payments are made continuously. So the formula for the present value of a continuous income stream is PV = PMT * (1 - e^(-rT)) / r, where PMT is the continuous payment rate per period.

Wait, but in this case, the payment is $800 per month. So perhaps the PMT in the formula is in annual terms. So PMT would be 800 dollars per month, but over a year, so 800 * 12 = 9600 per year. So that's the annual continuous payment rate.

So using that, the formula gives PV = 9600 * (1 - e^(-0.09*20)) / 0.09.

As before, this gives approximately 9600 * 0.8347 / 0.09 → 9600 * 9.272 → which was around 89000, but my approximation gave me about 88,939. However, the option F is 89,034.79, which is very close. Perhaps the exact calculation gives 89,034.79.

Wait, perhaps the exponent is more accurately calculated. Let me compute e^-1.8 more accurately.

Let me try to compute e^-1.8:

We can compute it using the Taylor series expansion:

e^x = 1 + x + x^2/2! + x^3/3! + x^4/4! + ...

But since x is negative here, e^-1.8 = 1 / e^1.8.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute e^1.8 more accurately.

Compute e^1.8:

1.8 is between 1.609 (ln(5)=1.6094) and 1.7918 (ln(6)=1.7918).

e^1.8: Let me compute it using the Taylor series around x=1.6.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that e^1.8 = e^(1 + 0.8) = e * e^0.8.

We know e ≈ 2.71828.

e^0.8: Let's compute that. 0.8 is 4/5.

Compute e^0.8:

e^0.8 ≈ 1 + 0.8 + 0.8²/2 + 0.8^3/6 + 0.8^4/24 + 0.8^5/120 + 0.8^6/720.

Compute each term:

0.8^1 = 0.8 → 0.8

0.8^2 = 0.64 → 0.64 / 2 = 0.32 → total so far: 1 + 0.8 + 0.32 = 2.12

0.8^3 = 0.512 → 0.512 /6 ≈ 0.0853 → total ≈ 2.2053

0.8^4 = 0.4096 → 0.4096 /24 ≈ 0.01707 → total ≈ 2.22237

0.8^5 = 0.32768 → 0.32768 / 120 ≈ 0.00273 → total ≈ 2.2251

0.8^6 = 0.262144 → 0.262144 /720 ≈ 0.000364 → total ≈ 2.22546

So e^0.8 ≈ 2.2255 (actual value is about 2.225540928).

So e^1.8 = e * e^0.8 ≈ 2.71828 * 2.2255 ≈ Let's compute that.

2.71828 * 2 = 5.43656

2.71828 * 0.2255 ≈ 0.6131

So total e^1.8 ≈ 5.43656 + 0.6131 ≈ 6.04966.

So e^1.8 ≈ 6.04966, so e^-1.8 ≈ 1/6.04966 ≈ 0.16527.

So 1 - e^(-1.8) ≈ 1 - 0.16527 = 0.83473.

Thus, (1 - e^(-rT))/r = 0.83473 / 0.09 ≈ 9.2759.

So PV = 9600 * 9.2759 = ?

Compute 9600 * 9 = 86400.

9600 * 0.2759 = let's compute:

0.2 * 9600 = 1920

0.07 * 9600 = 672

0.0059 * 9600 = 56.64

So 1920 + 672 = 2592 + 56.64 = 2648.64.

So total PV ≈ 86400 + 2648.64 = 89048.64.

Wait, that's around $89,048.64. The option F is $89,034.79, which is very close but slightly less. Hmm, maybe I made a small error in calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a more accurate value for e^-1.8. Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that I'm using annual payments, but the actual formula expects the monthly payment to be treated as a continuous rate. Wait, maybe I should model it differently.

Wait, perhaps I should not convert the monthly payment to annual but use the monthly rate in the formula, adjusting for the time period. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: Treat the payment as a continuous monthly payment, so the payment rate is 800 per month. Then, the total period is 20 years, which is 240 months. But since the payments are continuous, perhaps the formula should use the monthly rate and monthly interest rate.

Wait, maybe that's the better approach. Let's try that.

So, r is the annual interest rate, 9%, compounded continuously. So the monthly interest rate would be r/12, but since it's continuous, actually, the effective monthly rate is (e^(r/12) - 1), but perhaps I'm complicating.

Wait, no, if it's compounded continuously, the formula remains the same regardless of the time unit. So the formula for the present value would be:

PV = (PMT_monthly) * (1 - e^(-r*T)) / r

But PMT_monthly is 800 per month. Wait, no, because in the continuous payment model, the payment rate is per unit time. So the payment rate PMT would be 800 per month, but over a year, that's 9600 per year. So perhaps the approach I took earlier is correct, and the present value is approximately $89,048.64, which is very close to option F: $89,034.79.

But why the slight discrepancy? Perhaps because I approximated e^-1.8 as 0.16527, but maybe the exact value is a little different, or perhaps the formula requires a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should use a different formula. Another approach is that when payments are made continuously, the present value of each payment is the integral of the payment stream. So for a 20-year mortgage with continuous payments at a rate of $800 per month, the present value would be:

PV = ∫ (from 0 to 20) 800 * e^(-0.09*t) dt

Wait, but wait, 800 is per month, so we need to express it in annual terms. So 800 per month is 800 * 12 = 9600 per year, so the payment rate is 9600 per year. Thus, the integral becomes:

PV = ∫ (0 to 20) 9600 * e^(-0.09 t) dt

Which is 9600 * [ (1 - e^(-0.09*20)) / 0.09 ].

Which is exactly what I did earlier. So the calculation should be correct, leading to approximately $89,048.64, but the option F is $89,034.79.

Hmm, perhaps I made a calculation error in the multiplication.

Wait, let me compute 9600 * 9.2759 again.

Compute 9600 * 9.2759:

Break it down:

9600 * 9 = 86400

9600 * 0.2759 = ?

Compute 0.2 * 9600 = 1920

0.07 * 9600 = 672

0.0059 * 9600 = 56.64

Adding those: 1920 + 672 = 2592; 2592 + 56.64 = 2648.64

So 9600 * 9.2759 = 86400 + 2648.64 = 89048.64. So approximately $
