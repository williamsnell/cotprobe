C: 32
D: 64
E: 192
F: 2
G: 24
H: 8
I: 96

Okay, so I've got this question here about chromosomes and meiosis. Hmm, let's see what it says. The organism has a diploid number (2n) of 96. And the question is asking how many chromosomes the cells will have after meiosis. 

Wait, I remember that meiosis is the process that reduces the chromosome number by half. So normally, in humans, 2n is 46, and after meiosis, gametes have 23, which is n. So for this organism, 2n is 96, meaning n would be 48. So after meiosis, each gamete should have 48 chromosomes. 

But wait, the question says the cells after meiosis. Oh, right, meiosis produces four cells, each with n chromosomes. So regardless of the initial 2n being 96, after meiosis it's 48 per cell. 

Looking at the options, I see option J is 48. So the answer must be J.

Wait, did I miss anything? Let me think again. 2n is the diploid state, so meiosis I reduces it to n, which is 48. Then meiosis II divides the sister chromatids, but the number of chromosomes stays at 48. So yes, each cell ends up with 48. So the correct answer is J.

The organism has a diploid chromosome number (2n) of 96. During meiosis, the chromosome number is halved, resulting in haploid cells (n) with 48 chromosomes each. 

After meiosis I, each cell has 48 chromosomes, and meiosis II does not change the chromosome number further. Therefore, the cells after meiosis will each have 48 chromosomes. 

The correct answer is **J: 48**.
