Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the payback period for insulating a copper pipe. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on heat transfer, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the problem says the pipe is carrying steam at 212°F through a room that's 60°F. So the temperature difference is pretty big, which probably means a lot of heat loss if not insulated. The pipe's dimensions are given: 1 inch outer diameter and 0.88 inch inner diameter. The thermal conductivity of copper is 220 Btu/hr-ft-°F. Oh wait, so copper is a good conductor, so the heat will transfer through it easily.

The insulation is 85% magnesia, which I think is a type of insulation material. Its thickness is 0.57 inches, and its thermal conductivity (k) is 0.038 Btu/hr-ft-°F. The cost of the insulation is $3.25 per foot. The heating cost of steam is 0.05 cents per Btu. So we need to find the payback period, which is the time it takes for the savings from insulation to pay for the initial cost.

The options are given as various hours, so the payback period is in hours. Hmm, that's interesting because payback periods are usually in years or months, but maybe in this case, the costs and savings are so significant that the payback is quick.

The problem also says to assume a constant fluid film resistance of 0.95 hr-ft²-°F/Btu and neglect the outer surface film resistance. So I think I can ignore the outside convection resistance since it's not mentioned, but the inside has this film resistance.

So the approach here is probably to calculate the heat loss per foot of the pipe without insulation and with insulation, then find the energy savings per foot, convert that into cost savings, and then find how long it takes for the savings to equal the insulation cost.

Let me get the formula for heat transfer. For a cylindrical pipe, the heat transfer rate (Q) is given by:

Q = (2π * L * (T_infinity_inner - T_infinity_outer)) / ( (1/(h_i * r_i)) + ln(r_o/r_i) / k_pipe + (1/(h_o * r_o)) )

But wait, in this problem, the pipe is first bare (without insulation), and then insulated. So I need to compute Q for both cases: the bare pipe and the insulated pipe, then find the difference, which is the heat saved by insulating.

Wait, but maybe I should compute Q with and without insulation. The heat loss without insulation would be higher, so the difference would be the heat saved, which translates into cost saved.

Wait, but the problem says to calculate the payback period of the insulation cost. So the insulation reduces heat loss, so the cost saved is from not losing that heat.

So first, let's compute the heat loss without insulation, then with insulation, subtract to get the heat saved per foot, then find the cost saved per hour, and then divide the insulation cost by the cost saved per hour to get the payback time.

But wait, the problem gives the cost of steam as 0.05 cents per Btu. So we can calculate how much money is saved per Btu saved, then per hour, etc.

Let me structure this:

1. Calculate the heat loss per foot for the bare pipe (without insulation).
2. Calculate the heat loss per foot with insulation.
3. Find the difference (heat saved per foot per hour).
4. Convert that to Btu saved per foot per hour.
5. Multiply by the cost per Btu to get $ saved per foot per hour.
6. Divide the insulation cost per foot ($3.25) by the $ saved per hour to get the payback period in hours.

But wait, the insulation cost is $3.25 per foot. So if I'm doing per foot, then the payback is in hours per foot. Or maybe the problem is for one foot, so the payback is how long it takes for one foot of insulation to pay for itself.

Alternatively, maybe it's for the entire pipe, but since the problem gives per foot costs, perhaps we can just calculate per foot.

So let's start with calculating Q for the bare pipe.

For the bare pipe, the resistances involved are the inside film resistance and the outside film resistance. But the problem says to neglect the outer surface film resistance, so I can ignore that. So the total resistance is just the inside film resistance.

Wait, the problem says "assume a constant fluid film resistance (0.95 hr-ft²-°F/Btu)" and "neglect outer surface film resistance." So the total resistance R_total is just the fluid film resistance, which is 0.95.

So for the bare pipe, the heat transfer per foot would be:

Q_bare = (T_steam - T_room) / R_total

Because for a cylindrical wall, if we ignore the conduction through the pipe (since copper's k is very high, so the conduction resistance is negligible), the heat transfer would be primarily through the inside film.

Wait, but wait, the pipe's own resistance is (ln(r_o/r_i))/(2π k L). Let me compute that.

r_i is the inner radius: 0.88 in / 2 = 0.44 in. Similarly, r_o is 1 in /2 = 0.5 in.

Wait, let's convert inches to feet because the units are in ft. So 0.44 inches is 0.44/12 = 0.3667 ft? Wait no, 1 ft is 12 inches. So yes, 0.44 in is 0.44/12 = 0.03667 ft. Similarly, 0.5 in is 0.04167 ft.

So the pipe's conduction resistance R_pipe is ln(r_o/r_i)/(2π k L). Hmm, but for a 1-foot length, L=1 ft.

So R_pipe = ln(0.04167/0.03667) / (2π * 220 * 1)

Calculating the natural log of (0.04167/0.03667) is ln(1.136) ≈ 0.126.

So R_pipe ≈ 0.126 / (2 * π * 220) ≈ 0.126 / (1382) ≈ 0.0000911 hr-ft²-°F/Btu.

That's a very small resistance compared to the film resistance of 0.95. So yes, we can neglect the pipe's conduction resistance. So the total resistance for the bare pipe is just R_total_bare = R_film = 0.95.

So Q_bare = (212 - 60) / 0.95 = 152 / 0.95 ≈ 160 Btu/hr.

Wait, let's compute that exactly. 152 ÷ 0.95: 0.95 * 160 = 152, so yes, exactly 160 Btu/hr per foot.

Wait, but wait, the formula for Q is (T_infinity_inner - T_infinity_outer) / R_total, and the units would be Btu per hour per foot.

So that's the heat loss without insulation.

Now, with the insulation. Now, the insulation adds another layer of resistance. So now, the total resistance R_total_insulated is R_film (inside) + R_insulation + R_outside.

But the problem says to neglect the outer surface film resistance, so R_outside is zero. So R_total_insulated = R_film + R_insulation.

What's R_insulation? It's the conduction resistance through the insulation.

The insulation's thickness is 0.57 inches, so the outer radius after insulation would be r_o_ins = r_o_pipe + insulation thickness.

Wait, the insulation is 0.57 inches thick. So the insulation's outer radius is the pipe's outer radius plus 0.57 inches. Wait, but in what direction? Let me think: the insulation goes around the pipe, so the insulation's inner radius is the pipe's outer radius (0.5 in), and the insulation's outer radius is 0.5 in + 0.57 in = 1.07 in.

So converting to feet: 0.5 inches is 0.04167 ft, 1.07 inches is 1.07/12 = 0.08917 ft.

So the insulation's inner radius r_i_ins = 0.04167 ft, outer r_o_ins = 0.08917 ft.

So the conduction resistance through insulation is R_insulation = ln(r_o_ins / r_i_ins) / (2π k_insulation * L).

k_insulation is 0.038 Btu/hr-ft-°F.

So R_insulation = ln(0.08917 / 0.04167) / (2π * 0.038 * 1).

Let me compute that.

First, 0.08917 / 0.04167 ≈ 2.14. So ln(2.14) ≈ 0.76.

Then denominator: 2 * π * 0.038 ≈ 0.2388.

So R_insulation ≈ 0.76 / 0.2388 ≈ 3.18 hr-ft²-°F/Btu.

So R_total_insulated = R_film + R_insulation = 0.95 + 3.18 ≈ 4.13 hr-ft²-°F/Btu.

Then, the heat loss with insulation is Q_insulated = (212 - 60) / 4.13 ≈ 152 / 4.13 ≈ 36.8 Btu/hr.

So the heat saved per foot is Q_bare - Q_insulated = 160 - 36.8 = 123.2 Btu/hr.

Wait, but let me double-check these numbers because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, 0.08917 / 0.04167 is approximately 2.14, correct. ln(2.14) is about 0.76.

Denominator: 2π*0.038*1 = 0.2388. So 0.76 / 0.2388 is approximately 3.18, yes.

So R_insulated is 0.95 +3.18=4.13.

Then, Q_insulated is 152 /4.13. Let me compute that more accurately.

4.13 * 36 = 148.68, which is 148.68. 152 is 3.32 more. 3.32 /4.13 ≈ 0.8. So 36.8 is correct.

So heat saved is 160 -36.8=123.2 Btu/hr per foot.

Now, the cost saved per hour per foot is 123.2 Btu/hr * 0.05 cents/Btu.

Wait, 0.05 cents is $0.0005 per Btu.

So 123.2 * 0.0005 = $0.0616 per hour per foot.

The insulation cost is $3.25 per foot. So the payback period is 3.25 / 0.0616 ≈ 52.8 hours.

Looking at the options, option D is 52 hours, option G is 58, and option F is 48. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, let me check the calculations again.

First, Q_bare: (212-60) / 0.95 = 152 /0.95 = 160, correct.

Then, for the insulation:

r_i_ins = 0.04167 ft, r_o_ins=0.08917 ft.

ln(0.08917/0.04167)=ln(2.14)=approx 0.76.

R_insulation=0.76/(2π*0.038*1) = 0.76 / (0.2388) ≈3.18, correct.

So R_total_insulated=0.95+3.18=4.13.

Q_insulated=152/4.13=approx 36.8, correct.

So heat saved per foot: 160-36.8=123.2 Btu/hr.

Cost saved: 123.2 * 0.0005 = $0.0616 per hour.

Payback period: 3.25 /0.0616 ≈ 52.8 hours.

So the closest option is D:52 hours.

Wait, but let me check if I considered all resistances correctly. Oh wait, in the insulated case, do I have any other resistances? The problem says to neglect the outer surface film resistance. So yes, only R_film inside and R_insulation.

Wait, another thought: when the pipe is insulated, the outer radius increases, so the area for heat loss increases. Does that affect the calculation? Because in the original Q, I used the same formula, but perhaps the area changes, so maybe I should compute Q using the outer radius.

Wait, no, the formula I used for Q is correct for each case because in the formula, Q is calculated as (delta T) / R_total, where R_total is the sum of all thermal resistances in the path. So that's correct.

So I think the calculation is accurate. So the payback period is approximately 52.8 hours, which rounds to 53, but the closest option is D:52 hours. Alternatively, let me see if the options have 53; looking back, the options are A:65, B:77, C:70, D:52, E:84, F:48, G:58, H:75, I:61, J:90.

So D is 52, which is the closest. So I think the answer is D.

### Step 1: Heat loss for the bare pipe
For the bare pipe, the total resistance is dominated by the fluid film resistance, as the pipe's conduction resistance is negligible:
\[
R_{\text{total, bare}} = R_{\text{film}} = 0.95 \, \text{hr-ft}^2\text{-°F/Btu}.
\]
The heat loss per foot is:
\[
Q_{\text{bare}} = \frac{T_{\text{steam}} - T_{\text{room}}}{R_{\text{total, bare}}} = \frac{152}{0.95} \approx 160 \, \text{Btu/hr}.
\]

---

### Step 2: Heat loss for the insulated pipe
The total resistance for the insulated pipe includes the fluid film resistance and the insulation's conduction resistance:
\[
R_{\text{total, insulated}} = R_{\text{film}} + R_{\text{insulation}}.
\]
The insulation's conduction resistance is calculated as:
\[
R_{\text{insulation}} = \frac{\ln(r_{\text{o, insulation}} / r_{\text{i, insulation}})}{2 \pi k_{\text{insulation}} L},
\]
where \( r_{\text{i, insulation}} = 0.04167 \, \text{ft} \) (pipe's outer radius) and \( r_{\text{o, insulation}} = 0.08917 \, \text{ft} \) (outer radius with insulation). Substituting:
\[
R_{\text{insulation}} = \frac{\ln(0.08917 / 0.04167)}{2 \pi (0.038)(1)} = \frac{\ln(2.14)}{0.2388} \approx \frac{0.76}{0.2388} \approx 3.18 \, \text{hr-ft}^2\text{-°F/Btu}.
\]
Thus:
\[
R_{\text{total, insulated}} = 0.95 + 3.18 = 4.13 \, \text{hr-ft}^2\text{-°F/Btu}.
\]
The heat loss with insulation is:
\[
Q_{\text{insulated}} = \frac{T_{\text{steam}} - T_{\text{room}}}{R_{\text{total, insulated}}} = \frac{152}{4.13} \approx 36.8 \, \text{Btu/hr}.
\]

---

### Step 3: Heat saved and cost savings
The heat saved per foot is:
\[
Q_{\text{saved}} = Q_{\text{bare}} - Q_{\text{insulated}} = 160 - 36.8 = 123.2 \, \text{Btu/hr}.
\]
The cost saved per hour is:
\[
\text{Cost saved} = Q_{\text{saved}} \times \text{cost of steam} = 123.2 \times 0.0005 \approx 0.0616 \, \text{\$/hr}.
\]

---

### Step 4: Payback period
The payback period is the time required for the insulation cost to be recovered through savings:
\[
\text{Payback period} = \frac{\text{Insulation cost}}{\text{Cost saved per hour}} = \frac{3.25}{0.0616} \approx 52.8 \, \text{hours}.
\]

---

### Final Answer:
The payback period is approximately **52 hours**, which corresponds to option **D**.
