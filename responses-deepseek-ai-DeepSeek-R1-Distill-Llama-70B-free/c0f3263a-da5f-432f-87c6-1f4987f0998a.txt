Question:

Intestinal motility is a complex process, orchestrated by nerves, hormones and the presence of food in the stomach. Which statement about this process is correct?


Options:

A: At the start of a meal, the stomach increases its "tone" in order to develop pressure which will lead to expulsion of its contents, via the pylorus
B: The presence of partially digested fat and starch in the duodenum, speeds up intestinal motility
C: The migrating motor complex is chiefly responsible for the absorption of nutrients after a meal has been consumed
D: The migrating motor complex is chiefly responsible for peristaltic movement of food after a meal has been consumed
E: The release of glucagon after eating a meal will speed up the emptying of the stomach
F: The stomach decreases its "tone" at the end of a meal to develop pressure which will lead to expulsion of its contents, via the pylorus
G: The presence of partially digested fat and starch in the duodenum, slows intestinal motility
H: The release of insulin after eating a meal will speed up the emptying of the stomach
I: The presence of partially digested protein and fiber in the duodenum, speeds up intestinal motility

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about intestinal motility, and I'm trying to figure out the correct answer. Let's start by breaking down the question and the options.

The question states that intestinal motility is a complex process involving nerves, hormones, and the presence of food in the stomach. I need to pick the correct statement about this process.

I remember that intestinal motility refers to the movement of the digestive system and the transit of its contents through the digestive tract. It's regulated by various factors, including the enteric nervous system, hormones, and reflexes.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: At the start of a meal, the stomach increases its "tone" to develop pressure which will lead to expulsion of its contents via the pylorus. Hmm, I think when the stomach starts receiving food, it relaxes to accommodate more, not necessarily increase tone right away. I'm not sure. Wait, tone refers to the muscle's state; increased tone could mean more contraction. Maybe this is related to the gastric contractions that help mix food. But expulsion via the pylorus... I'm not certain. Maybe I'll come back to this.

Option B: Presence of partially digested fat and starch in the duodenum speeds up intestinal motility. Wait, I remember that the presence of certain substances in the duodenum can influence motility. Like, when the duodenum detects food, especially fats, it releases hormones that slow gastric emptying. So maybe fat in the duodenum slows down the stomach's emptying and also affects motility. But does it speed up or slow down intestinal movement? I think it might slow down because the body wants more time to process the nutrients, so maybe this option is incorrect.

Option C: The migrating motor complex is responsible for nutrient absorption after a meal. No, I think the migrating motor complex (MMC) is more about clearing the upper tract during fasting. It helps move residual contents into the colon and prevents the backflow of bacteria into the small intestine. So during a meal, the MMC is less active. Therefore, C is probably incorrect.

Option D: The migrating motor complex is responsible for peristaltic movement after a meal. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. The MMC is more active during fasting. After a meal, it's the fed motility patterns that dominate, not the MMC. So D might be incorrect.

Option E: Glucagon release speeds up stomach emptying. I'm a bit fuzzy on glucagon's role here. Glucagon is released when blood glucose is low, typically between meals. I think it might slow down gastric emptying to prevent too much glucose entering the system too quickly. Or wait, maybe it's the opposite. Alternatively, maybe after eating, when insulin is high, glucagon is low. I'm not sure, so I'll have to think about this more.

Option F: The stomach decreases its tone at the end of a meal to expel contents via the pylorus. Tone decrease would mean the stomach is more relaxed. Wait, when the stomach is full, it's in a state of receptive relaxation, so that's at the beginning. But towards the end, when it's time to empty, maybe the tone increases. So F might be incorrect.

Option G: Partially digested fat and starch slow intestinal motility. This sounds familiar. I think when the duodenum detects fat, it releases hormones like cholecystokinin (CCK), which slows gastric emptying and also slows down intestinal motility so that nutrients can be absorbed properly. So G could be correct.

Option H: Insulin speeds up stomach emptying. I thought insulin doesn't directly affect this much. Or maybe it's the opposite. Wait, after eating, insulin is released, and high insulin might slow down gastric emptying to manage blood sugar. Or perhaps it's glucagon that affects it. Not too sure, might need to think more.

Option I: Partially digested protein and fiber speed up motility. I'm not certain. Protein might stimulate some hormonal responses. Fiber tends to increase motility, but I'm not sure if it's the same when it's in the duodenum. Alternatively, maybe presence of certain nutrients speeds up or slows down depending on what they are.

Now, let's reconsider the options. The question asks which statement is correct.

Option G says fat and starch slow motility. I remember that when food enters the small intestine, especially if it's high in fat, the body releases hormones to slow down the movement so that absorption can occur properly. So this would slow down motility, making G correct.

Alternatively, option I says protein and fiber speed up motility. I'm not as sure about that. I think maybe proteins might cause a moderate response, but I donâ€™t recall it speeding up as much as fat slows it down.

So looking back at the options, G seems correct. Let me check other options again.

Option E: Glucagon. I think glucagon might slow stomach emptying. So E would be incorrect because it says it speeds up.

Option A: At the start of a meal, stomach increases tone. I think when you start eating, the stomach relaxes to accommodate the food (receptive relaxation), so the tone decreases, not increases. So A is wrong.

Option B: Fat and starch speed up. That's incorrect; they slow down.

Option C: MMC responsible for absorption. No, MMC is for clearing.

Option D: MMC responsible for peristalsis after meal. No, the MMC is more between meals.

Option F: Stomach decreases tone at end of meal. I'm not sure. If the stomach is expelling, maybe the tone increases. So F is probably incorrect.

Option H: Insulin speeds up emptying. I'm not certain. Maybe the opposite. High insulin after a meal might slow emptying. So H is probably incorrect.

Option I: Protein and fiber speed up. I'm not sure. I think it's more about the type of food. Maybe if the duodenum detects something, it might trigger more contractions, but I'm not certain.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer is G: The presence of partially digested fat and starch in the duodenum slows intestinal motility.

Intestinal motility is a complex process regulated by nerves, hormones, and the presence of food in the stomach. To determine the correct statement, each option was analyzed:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. At the start of a meal, the stomach relaxes to accommodate food (receptive relaxation), so tone decreases rather than increases.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The presence of partially digested fat and starch in the duodenum slows intestinal motility, as the body needs time for proper absorption.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The migrating motor complex (MMC) is primarily active during fasting to clear residual contents, not for nutrient absorption after a meal.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The MMC is not responsible for peristaltic movement after a meal; it is more active during fasting.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. Glucagon, released when blood glucose is low, typically slows gastric emptying rather than speeding it up.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The stomach decreases tone at the start of a meal for receptive relaxation, not at the end.
- **Option G**: Correct. The presence of partially digested fat and starch in the duodenum slows intestinal motility to allow time for nutrient absorption.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. Insulin, released after a meal, may slow gastric emptying to manage blood sugar rather than speeding it up.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. While fiber can increase motility, protein and fiber in the duodenum do not necessarily speed up motility in this context.

The correct answer is **G**, as the presence of partially digested fat and starch in the duodenum slows intestinal motility to facilitate proper absorption.

Answer: G
