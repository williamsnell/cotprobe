Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about machine learning concepts, specifically dealing with kernels, nearest neighbors, and VC dimensions. Hmm, I need to figure out whether the two statements are true or false and then choose the correct option from A to J.

Let me break down each statement one by one.

**Statement 1:** After mapping into feature space Q through a radial basis kernel function, 1-NN using unweighted Euclidean distance may be able to achieve better classification performance than in original space (though we can’t guarantee this).

Wait, radial basis kernel functions are used to map data into a higher-dimensional space where the data might be linearly separable. The 1-NN algorithm relies on the distance metric to find the nearest neighbor. In the original space, if the data isn't well-separated, 1-NN might not perform well. But when you map it to a higher-dimensional space using a kernel like RBF, the data could be more spread out or have a structure that allows for better separation. So 1-NN might perform better because it's operating in a space where the features are more informative. But the statement says "may be able" and "can't guarantee", which makes sense because it depends on the data and the kernel parameters. So I think this statement is true.

**Statement 2:** The VC dimension of a Perceptron is smaller than the VC dimension of a simple linear SVM.

Wait, I remember that VC dimension is a measure of the capacity of a model. Perceptron is a linear classifier, same as linear SVM. But wait, the VC dimension for a linear classifier in d dimensions is d+1. So for both Perceptron and linear SVM, the VC dimensions should be the same if they're in the same space. But wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no. Wait, the Perceptron is a specific algorithm that finds a linear separator, and so does the linear SVM. But the VC dimension for both would be the same because they're both linear models. Unless there's something I'm missing about SVMs. Oh wait, wait! When using kernels, SVMs can have higher VC dimensions because they can operate in higher-dimensional spaces implicitly. But the statement says "simple linear SVM" which implies no kernel or the linear kernel. So in that case, both have the same VC dimension. So the statement that Perceptron's VC is smaller than linear SVM's would be false. Because they're the same.

Wait, but wait another thought. The VC dimension of a linear classifier is d+1, where d is the input dimension. So if both Perceptron and linear SVM are in the same d, their VC dimensions are the same. So statement 2 is false.

Wait, but another angle: maybe the Perceptron's VC dimension is actually the same as the linear SVM's. So statement 2 says it's smaller, which would be false.

So putting it together: Statement 1 is true, statement 2 is false.

Now looking at the options, the correct option would be where the first part is true and the second is false. Looking at the options:

Option C: True, False.

Option F: True, True. No, because statement 2 is false.

Option I: Partly True, False. No, because statement 1 is fully true as per my analysis.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check statement 1. The statement says that after mapping into feature space Q via RBF kernel, 1-NN may perform better. Is that always possible? Well, using a kernel can allow the data to be more separable, so 1-NN might find better neighbors. But it's not guaranteed because it depends on the data. So the statement is correct in saying that it may be better, which is why I think statement 1 is true.

So, if statement 1 is true and statement 2 is false, the correct option is C: True, False.

**Analysis of the Statements:**

1. **Statement 1:** After mapping into feature space Q through a radial basis kernel function, 1-NN using unweighted Euclidean distance may be able to achieve better classification performance than in original space (though we can’t guarantee this).  
   - Radial basis kernel functions map data into a higher-dimensional space where it may become more separable. In this space, 1-NN can potentially perform better due to the improved structure of the data. However, this is not guaranteed as it depends on the specific data and kernel parameters. Therefore, this statement is **True**.

2. **Statement 2:** The VC dimension of a Perceptron is smaller than the VC dimension of a simple linear SVM.  
   - Both the Perceptron and a simple linear SVM are linear classifiers with the same VC dimension in the same input space. The VC dimension for a linear classifier in \(d\)-dimensional space is \(d+1\). Since the statement specifies a "simple linear SVM," it implies no kernel, meaning the VC dimensions are equal. Thus, the claim that the Perceptron's VC dimension is smaller is **False**.

**Conclusion:**  
- Statement 1 is **True**, and Statement 2 is **False**.  
- The correct option is **C: True, False**.
