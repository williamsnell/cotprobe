Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about length contraction in special relativity. Hmm, let me think. I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, they experience length contraction in the direction of motion. The formula for length contraction is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where L is the contracted length, L0 is the proper length (the length at rest), v is the velocity, and c is the speed of light.

Wait, the problem says the observer is moving past a meter stick at half the speed of light. So the observer is moving relative to the meter stick. Wait, no, wait. Actually, in special relativity, it's the object that's moving relative to the observer that contracts. So in this case, the observer is moving, so the meter stick is at rest in his frame, or is the meter stick moving?

Wait, no. Wait, the observer is moving past the meter stick. So from the observer's point of view, the meter stick is moving. So the length he measures would be contracted. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, in the observer's frame, the meter stick is moving, so it should be length-contracted. But wait, the question says the observer is moving past the meter stick at a velocity that's half the speed of light. So, the observer is moving, and the meter stick is stationary in the lab frame, I guess.

Wait, but from the observer's perspective, he's stationary and the meter stick is moving towards him at v = 0.5c. So he would measure the length of the moving meter stick. So yes, length contraction applies here.

So the proper length L0 is 1 meter, which is 100 cm. The velocity v is (1/2)c. Plugging into the formula: L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 100 cm * sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2/c²) = 100 cm * sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 100 cm * sqrt(0.75).

Wait, sqrt(0.75) is approximately 0.866. So 100 cm * 0.866 is about 86.6 cm. So the correct answer would be F:86.6 cm.

Wait, wait, but I should double-check the formula. Length contraction formula is correct. Because the moving observer measures the length of the object (meter stick) as contracted. So yes, L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Alternatively, maybe I'm getting it backwards. Wait, another way: the observer is moving at 0.5c relative to the meter stick. So the meter stick is moving at 0.5c in the observer's frame. The meter stick's proper length is 1m, so the moving length is contracted. So yes, same calculation.

So the answer should be F:86.6 cm.

To determine the length of the meter stick measured by the observer moving past it at half the speed of light, we apply the concept of length contraction from special relativity. The formula for length contraction is:

\[
L = L_0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( L_0 \) is the proper length of the meter stick (1 meter or 100 cm),
- \( v \) is the velocity of the observer relative to the meter stick (\( 0.5c \)),
- \( c \) is the speed of light.

Substituting the values:

\[
L = 100 \, \text{cm} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{0.5c}{c}\right)^2} = 100 \, \text{cm} \cdot \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = 100 \, \text{cm} \cdot \sqrt{0.75}.
\]

The square root of 0.75 is approximately 0.866, so:

\[
L \approx 100 \, \text{cm} \cdot 0.866 = 86.6 \, \text{cm}.
\]

Thus, the observer measures the length of the meter stick to be approximately **86.6 cm**.
