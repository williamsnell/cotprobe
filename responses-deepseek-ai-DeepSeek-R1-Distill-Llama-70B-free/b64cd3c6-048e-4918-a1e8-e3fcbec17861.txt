Okay, so I've got this question about the pH of two lakes. I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says Lake A has a pH of 8.0 and Lake B has a pH of 6.0. I know pH is a measure of how acidic or basic a solution is. The pH scale goes from 0 to 14, right? So, a pH of 7 is neutral. Below 7 is acidic, and above is alkaline or basic.

So Lake A is at 8.0. That's slightly above 7, so it's alkaline. Lake B is at 6.0, which is below 7, so it's acidic. That's the first thing I notice.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Lake B is alkaline. Wait, no. Lake B is acidic because its pH is 6. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Lake B is 100 times more alkaline than Lake A. Hmm. Wait, I'm confused. If Lake B is more alkaline, that would mean a higher pH, but 6 is lower than 8. Oh wait, but wait. The statement says "more alkaline," which would be higher pH, but Lake B is lower. So B is incorrect. Also, the pH difference is 2 units. Since pH is logarithmic, each step is a tenfold change. So 2 steps would mean 100 times difference in hydrogen ion concentration. But wait, which way? Since Lake A is higher pH, it's more alkaline. So Lake B is more acidic, not alkaline. So B is wrong because Lake B isn't more alkaline; it's more acidic.

Option C: The hydrogen ion concentration of Lake B is 10^-4 M. Let me think. pH is the negative log of [H+]. So pH = -log[H+]. So [H+] = 10^(-pH). For Lake B, pH is 6. So 10^-6 M. Oh wait, 10^-6, which is 0.000001 M. So C says 10^-4, which is 0.0001 M. So that's incorrect. So option C is wrong.

Option D: The pH of both lakes will decrease in response to acid rain. Acid rain is acidic, so it adds H+ ions. If you add acid to a lake, the pH would decrease because the solution becomes more acidic. So if both lakes experience acid rain, their pH would go down. For example, if Lake A was 8, adding acid would make it lower, maybe 7 or less. Lake B is already 6, so adding acid would take it to, say, 5 or lower. So D seems correct. Both lakes' pH would decrease.

Wait, but what if one of the lakes is buffered? For example, if the lake has a high concentration of bicarbonate or other buffering agents, the pH might not decrease as much. But the question is about the general statement, not considering specific conditions. So the general effect of acid rain is to lower the pH, so D is correct.

So the correct answer is D.
</think>

The pH of Lake A is 8.0, making it slightly alkaline, while Lake B has a pH of 6.0, making it acidic. Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Lake B is acidic, not alkaline.  
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Lake B is more acidic, not more alkaline, than Lake A. A pH difference of 2 units means Lake A is 100 times more alkaline than Lake B, not the other way around.  
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The hydrogen ion concentration of Lake B is \(10^{-6} \, \text{M}\), not \(10^{-4} \, \text{M}\).  
- **Option D**: Correct. Acid rain lowers the pH of a solution by adding hydrogen ions (\(H^+\)), making both lakes more acidic over time.

Thus, the correct answer is **D**.
