Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the ratio of specific heats for air. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my thermodynamics, but let me try to work through this step by step.

The question says that air is considered an ideal gas, and we're given some data. At STP (standard temperature and pressure), the velocity of sound in air is 334 m/s. The molecular weight of air is 28.8 g/mol. We need to find the ratio of specific heats, which is gamma (γ), the ratio of the specific heat at constant pressure (Cp) to the specific heat at constant volume (Cv). So γ = Cp/Cv.

I remember that the speed of sound in an ideal gas is given by the formula v = sqrt(γRT/M), where R is the universal gas constant, T is the temperature, and M is the molar mass. Oh wait, right, because at STP, the temperature is 273 K, I think. Or wait, sometimes STP is considered 273.15 K and 1 atm pressure.

So, let's write down what we know:

v = 334 m/s
M (molar mass) = 28.8 g/mol = 0.0288 kg/mol (since 1 kg = 1000 g)
R is the universal gas constant. I remember R is 8.314 J/(mol·K).

We can rearrange the formula to solve for γ. Starting with v^2 = γRT/M.

So γ = (v^2 * M) / (R*T).

Wait, wait. What's the temperature here? At STP, it's 0 degrees Celsius, which is 273.15 K. So T = 273 K approximately.

Let me plug in the numbers:

v = 334 m/s → v^2 = 334^2 = let's calculate that. 300^2 is 90,000, 34^2 is 1,156, and the cross term is 2*300*34=20,400. So 90,000 + 20,400 + 1,156 = 111,556 m²/s².

M is 0.0288 kg/mol.

R is 8.314 J/(mol·K).

T is 273 K.

So putting it all together:

γ = (111556 * 0.0288) / (8.314 * 273)

Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

First, numerator: 111556 * 0.0288.

Let me compute 111556 * 0.0288. Let's break this down. 111556 * 0.02 is 2,231.12. 111556 * 0.008 is 892.448. 111556 * 0.0008 is 89.2448. So adding 2,231.12 + 892.448 = 3,123.568 + 89.2448 = 3,212.8128.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, wait, 0.0288 is 0.02 + 0.008 + 0.0008? No, that's 0.0288. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it as 111556 * 28.8 * 1e-3, since 0.0288 = 28.8e-3.

So 111556 * 28.8e-3 = (111556 * 28.8) / 1000.

Let me compute 111556 * 28.8.

Hmm, 111556 * 28 = 3,123,568. Because 111556 * 20 = 2,231,120; 111556 *8= 892,448. Sum is 2,231,120 + 892,448 = 3,123,568.

Then 111556 *0.8 = 89,244.8.

So 111556 * 28.8 = 3,123,568 + 89,244.8 = 3,212,812.8.

Now divide by 1000 → 3,212,812.8 / 1000 = 3,212.8128.

So the numerator is approximately 3,212.8128.

Denominator: 8.314 * 273.

8 * 273 = 2,184. 0.314 * 273 = let's see, 0.3 *273=81.9, 0.014*273=3.822 → total 85.722. So 2,184 + 85.722 = 2,269.722.

So denominator is 2,269.722.

So γ = 3,212.8128 / 2,269.722 ≈ Let me compute that.

Dividing 3,212.8 by 2,269.7.

Approximate: 2,269.7 * 1.4 is 3,177.58. Because 2,269.7 *1=2,269.7; *0.4=909.88 → sum 3,179.58.

Wait, 1.4 times 2,269.7 is 3,177.58.

Our numerator is 3,212.8, which is 35.22 higher than 3,177.58.

So 35.22 / 2,269.7 ≈ approximately 0.0155.

So γ ≈ 1.4 + 0.0155 = 1.4155.

Hmm, that's about 1.415 or so. Looking at the options, option G is 1.415, which is exactly what I got.

Wait, but wait a second. I remember that for diatomic gases like air (which is mostly N2 and O2), the gamma is around 1.4. So 1.4 is a common value. So why am I getting 1.415 here?

Ah, but the calculation I did gives 1.415, which is very close to 1.4 but a bit higher. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me double-check the numbers.

Compute v squared: 334^2.

334 *334: Let me compute 330^2=108900, 4^2=16, and 2*330*4=2640. So (330+4)^2=330^2 + 2*330*4 +4^2= 108900 + 2640+16= 111556. So that's correct.

M is 28.8 g/mol → 0.0288 kg/mol. Correct.

R is 8.314 J/mol·K. Correct.

T is 273 K.

So the calculation:

γ = (111556 * 0.0288) / (8.314 * 273) 

Numerator: 111556 * 0.0288 = let me compute more accurately.

Let me compute 111556 * 0.0288:

111556 * 0.02 = 2,231.12

111556 * 0.008 = 892.448

111556 * 0.0008 = 89.2448

Adding these: 2,231.12 + 892.448 = 3,123.568. Then +89.2448 → 3,212.8128.

Denominator: 8.314 *273 = let me compute 8*273=2184, 0.314*273.

0.3 *273 =81.9; 0.014*273=3.822. So 81.9+3.822=85.722.

2184 + 85.722=2269.722.

So 3,212.8128 / 2269.722 → let me compute this division more accurately.

2269.722 * 1.4 = 2269.722 * 1 =2269.722; 2269.722 *0.4=907.8888. Sum is 3177.6108.

Our numerator is 3212.8128, which is bigger than 3177.6108 by 35.202.

So 35.202 /2269.722 ≈ 0.0155.

So γ ≈1.4 +0.0155=1.4155.

So γ≈1.4155, which is approximately 1.416. Looking at the options, option G is 1.415, which is very close.

But wait, I also remember that the exact value for air is about 1.4, but perhaps the calculation here leads to 1.415. So is that one of the options?

Looking back, options are:

A:1.32, B:1.10, C:1.50, D:1.38, E:1.67, F:1.60, G:1.415, H:1.05, I:1.25, J:1.48.

Yes, G is 1.415. So that's the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if I made any mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: the formula for the speed of sound is v = sqrt(γRT/M), which is correct for an ideal gas, right? So that part is correct.

Another thing: sometimes, the molar mass is taken in kg/kmol. Wait, no, because R is in J/(mol·K), so the units should be consistent.

Wait, M is in kg/mol, right? Because R is in J/(mol·K), which is m²·kg/(s²·mol·K). So when you multiply by M (kg/mol), the units work out.

So the approach should be correct.

So I think the correct answer is G, 1.415.
</think>

To calculate the ratio of specific heats (γ) of air, we use the relationship between the speed of sound in an ideal gas and the formula:

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma R T}{M}}
\]

Rearranging for γ:

\[
\gamma = \frac{v^2 M}{R T}
\]

### Given Data:
- Speed of sound in air: \( v = 334 \, \text{m/s} \)
- Molar mass of air: \( M = 28.8 \, \text{g/mol} = 0.0288 \, \text{kg/mol} \)
- Universal gas constant: \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \)
- Temperature at STP: \( T = 273 \, \text{K} \)

### Step 1: Compute \( v^2 \)
\[
v^2 = 334^2 = 111556 \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2
\]

### Step 2: Compute the numerator (\( v^2 \cdot M \))
\[
v^2 \cdot M = 111556 \cdot 0.0288 = 3212.8128
\]

### Step 3: Compute the denominator (\( R \cdot T \))
\[
R \cdot T = 8.314 \cdot 273 = 2269.722
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( \gamma \)
\[
\gamma = \frac{3212.8128}{2269.722} \approx 1.415
\]

### Final Answer:
The calculated value of \( \gamma \) is approximately \( 1.415 \), which matches option **G**. This is consistent with the expected range for diatomic gases like air, where \( \gamma \) is typically around 1.4.
