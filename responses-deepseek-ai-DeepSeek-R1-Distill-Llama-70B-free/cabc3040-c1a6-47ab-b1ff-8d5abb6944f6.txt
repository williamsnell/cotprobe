Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because calculus isn't my strongest subject, but I'll give it a shot. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says that c is greater than 0, and the function f(x) is e^x minus c times x for all real numbers x. They're asking for the minimum value of f, and there are several options given as different expressions involving c and the function f evaluated at those points.

Hmm, right. So I remember that to find the minimum of a function, especially when dealing with calculus, I should probably find its derivative and then set the derivative equal to zero to find critical points. Once I have those, I can determine which one gives the minimum value.

Let me start by writing down the function again: f(x) = e^x - c x. The derivative of this function with respect to x is f'(x) = d/dx(e^x) - d/dx(c x). I know that the derivative of e^x is e^x, and the derivative of c x is just c, since c is a constant. So f'(x) = e^x - c.

To find critical points, set f'(x) = 0. So e^x - c = 0. Solving for x, I get e^x = c. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives x = ln(c). Okay, so x equals the natural log of c is where the function could have a minimum or maximum. Since the function is defined for all real numbers and e^x is always positive and increasing, I think this critical point is a minimum.

Wait, but wait. How do I know it's a minimum? I should probably check the second derivative to confirm. The second derivative of f(x) is f''(x) = derivative of f'(x), which is derivative of e^x, so f''(x) = e^x. Since e^x is always positive for any real x, the function is concave upward everywhere. That means the critical point at x = ln(c) is indeed a minimum.

So the function f(x) has its minimum at x = ln(c). Now, I need to evaluate f at this point to find the minimum value.

Let's compute f(ln(c)). Plugging into f(x), we get e^(ln(c)) - c * ln(c). Simplify that. e to the natural log of c is just c. So it becomes c - c ln(c), which factors to c(1 - ln(c)).

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see an option that directly says c(1 - ln c). The options are all in terms of f evaluated at various points. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. No, wait, the question asks for the minimum value of f, which is f at x=ln(c). So which option is that?

Looking at the options:

A: f(e^-c)
B: f(sqrt(c))
C: f(log c)
Wait, hold on. Wait, in my calculation, the critical point is x = ln(c). But in option C, it's f(log c). Wait, is log c the same as ln c? Well, in math, sometimes log without base is considered natural log, but sometimes it's base 10. Oh wait, in calculus contexts, log is often the natural logarithm, which is ln. So maybe option C is f(ln c), which would be the correct point.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option C is f(log c), which in this context is f(ln c), which is exactly where the minimum occurs.

But wait, wait another thing. Let me double-check the options to make sure. Let me list them again:

The options are:

A: f(e^-c)
B: f(sqrt(c))
C: f(log c)
D: f(-c)
E: f(e^c)
F: f(2c)
G: f(0)
H: f(c)
I: f(c^2)
J: f(1/c)

So option C is indeed f(log c). So the minimum occurs at x = log c (natural log), so the minimum value is f(log c), which is option C.

Wait, but no, wait. Wait, the question is asking for the minimum value of f, which is a value, not the x at which it occurs. So the options are giving expressions for where to evaluate f, and the correct one is the one that gives the minimal value.

So the minimal value is f(ln c), which is option C. But let me check each option to make sure.

Wait, option C is f(log c). If log is natural log, then yes. But in some contexts, log is base 10. But in the context of calculus, ln is natural log, and log is often used as natural log. So I think it's safe to assume that option C is correct.

Wait, wait another thought. Oh wait, in the problem statement, the function is f(x) = e^x - c x. So when x is ln(c), which is the natural logarithm, then f(ln c) is c - c ln c, as I found earlier. So that's the minimal value.

Looking back at the options, the options are all about which point to plug in. So the minimal value is f at x = ln(c), which is option C.

So the correct answer is C.

To find the minimum value of the function \( f(x) = e^x - cx \) for \( c > 0 \), we start by taking the derivative of \( f(x) \) with respect to \( x \):

\[
f'(x) = e^x - c.
\]

Setting \( f'(x) = 0 \) to find the critical points:

\[
e^x - c = 0 \implies e^x = c \implies x = \ln(c).
\]

To confirm that this critical point corresponds to a minimum, we compute the second derivative:

\[
f''(x) = e^x.
\]

Since \( e^x > 0 \) for all \( x \), the function is concave upward everywhere, and \( x = \ln(c) \) is indeed a minimum.

Next, we evaluate \( f(x) \) at \( x = \ln(c) \):

\[
f(\ln(c)) = e^{\ln(c)} - c \ln(c).
\]

Simplifying \( e^{\ln(c)} \) gives \( c \), so:

\[
f(\ln(c)) = c - c \ln(c) = c(1 - \ln(c)).
\]

This is the minimum value of \( f(x) \). The question asks for the minimum value of \( f \), which occurs at \( x = \ln(c) \). Among the given options, \( f(\ln(c)) \) corresponds to option **C**, assuming \( \log c \) refers to the natural logarithm in this context.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**C**
