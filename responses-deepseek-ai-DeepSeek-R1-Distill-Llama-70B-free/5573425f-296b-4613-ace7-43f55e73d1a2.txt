Okay, so I have this question about English law and custom. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is asking about the fundamental prerequisite for the incorporation of custom under English law. The options are from A to J. I remember that under common law systems, like England's, custom can become part of the law if certain conditions are met.

Wait, so what do I know about custom in English law? I think custom has to meet specific criteria to be recognized. One key point is that custom must not conflict with existing statutes. Oh right, because if there's a statute on the matter, the statute takes precedence. So if a custom is against an existing law, it won't be incorporated.

Looking at the options, option D says "Custom is incorporated if it is not in conflict with existing legislation." That sounds right. But wait, another thoughtâ€”there's also something about the common law. So does custom have to not conflict with common law or with legislation? I think it's both, but the main point is that if there's a statute, custom can't override it.

Option I says "Custom is incorporated if it is not in conflict with the common law." Hmm, that's a possibility too. But wait, isn't the requirement more about not conflicting with legislation? Because the common law is judge-made, and custom is a source of common law. So perhaps the main issue is legislation.

Wait, another angle: for custom to be part of the law, it must be recognized by the courts. And the courts will only recognize it if it doesn't go against any statutes. So the fundamental prerequisite is that it's not conflicting with existing legislation. So D would be correct.

But wait, what about option J? It says incorporation happens with implementing legislation. No, I don't think that's right. Custom is part of the common law, which doesn't require legislation. It's the courts that recognize it.

Option H suggests Parliament must recognize it first. No, that's not necessary. Custom can be recognized by the courts without Parliament's prior approval.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be D: Custom is incorporated if it is not in conflict with existing legislation.

The fundamental prerequisite for the incorporation of custom under English law is that the custom must not conflict with existing legislation. This ensures that customs, which can become part of the common law, do not override statutory laws passed by Parliament. While custom is recognized by the courts and does not require prior approval from Parliament or implementing legislation, its validity depends on its compatibility with the statutory framework. Therefore, the correct answer is:

D: Custom is incorporated if it is not in conflict with existing legislation.

Answer: D
