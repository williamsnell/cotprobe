Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about vapor pressure and enthalpy change. Hmm, the question gives me the vapor pressures of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) at two different temperatures. At 23°C, it's 0.132 atm, and at 58°C, it's 0.526 atm. I need to find the ∆H' in this temperature range.

Wait, I remember that vapor pressure is related to temperature and enthalpy of vaporization through the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. The equation is ln(P2/P1) = -ΔH/(R) [1/T2 - 1/T1], right? Or wait, maybe it's (1/T1 - 1/T2) in the denominator. Let me think. Oh yeah, the equation is usually written as ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2)/(1), assuming that ΔH is constant over the temperature range.

Wait, but wait. I've also seen it written as ln(P2/P1) = -(ΔH/R)(1/T2 - 1/T1). Let me get the exact formula right. I think the correct form is ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2) / (1), because when T increases, P increases, so the slope is positive. So higher P at higher T. So the equation should reflect that.

So the formula I should use is ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap / R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2). And since we're dealing with vaporization, ΔH should be positive. Oh wait, but wait, the question says ∆H'—maybe it's the enthalpy of vaporization, which is ΔHvap.

So the variables here are:
P1 = 0.132 atm at T1 = 23°C
P2 = 0.526 atm at T2 = 58°C

First, I need to convert the temperatures to Kelvin. So T1 = 23 + 273.15 = 296.15 K, and T2 = 58 + 273.15 = 331.15 K.

R is the gas constant. I think R is 8.314 J/mol·K.

So plugging into the equation:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH / R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2)

Let me calculate each part step by step.

First, compute P2/P1. P2 is 0.526, P1 is 0.132.

0.526 / 0.132 ≈ 3.9848. Let me compute that more accurately. 0.526 divided by 0.132. Hmm, 0.132 times 4 is 0.528, which is a bit more than 0.526, so 3.9848 is about right.

So ln(3.9848) is approximately... Let me think. ln(4) is about 1.386. But since 3.9848 is just a bit less than 4, maybe around 1.383 or so. Alternatively, using a calculator would be better, but since I'm just thinking, I'll proceed.

Next, calculate the term (1/T1 - 1/T2). So T1 is 296.15 K, T2 is 331.15 K.

Compute 1/296.15 ≈ 0.003376 (since 300 is 0.003333, so 296 is a bit higher, so reciprocal is a bit lower). Similarly, 1/331.15 ≈ 0.003021.

So the difference is 0.003376 - 0.003021 = 0.000355.

Wait, wait, 1/T1 is bigger than 1/T2 because T1 is lower. So 1/296.15 = 0.003376, 1/331.15 ≈ 0.003021. Subtracting the smaller from the larger: 0.003376 - 0.003021 = 0.000355 (per K).

So now, the equation becomes:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH/R) * 0.000355

Wait, but wait—wait, the equation is (1/T1 - 1/T2), which is positive because T2 > T1. So the term is positive.

So, we have ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH/R) * (positive number). Since P2 > P1, ln(...) is positive, so ΔH must be positive, which makes sense.

So, rearranging to solve for ΔH:

ΔH = [ln(P2/P1) * R] / (1/T1 - 1/T2)

Wait, no. Wait the equation is ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2). So solving for ΔH:

ΔH = [ln(P2/P1) * R] / (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

Wait, but 1/T1 -1/T2 is 0.000355, which is positive. So let's compute that.

Compute ln(0.526/0.132). Wait, P2 is higher, so ratio is greater than one, so ln is positive. Let's compute ln(3.9848). Let me get a better approximation. Let's think: e^1.386 is about 4, because ln(4) is approximately 1.386. So 3.9848 is just a tiny bit less than 4. So maybe 1.383.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator. Let me think, since I can't compute exact logs here. Let me think of e^1.38. e^1 is 2.718, e^0.38 is about 1.462, so 2.718 * 1.462 = approx 4. So 1.38 gives e^1.38 ≈ 3.98. So ln(3.9848) is approximately 1.38.

So ln(P2/P1) ≈ 1.38.

So plugging into the equation:

ΔH = (1.38 * 8.314) / (0.000355)

Let me compute the numerator first: 1.38 * 8.314 ≈ let's see. 1 * 8.314 is 8.314, 0.38 *8.314 is about 3.16. So total ≈ 11.474.

Wait, 8.314 * 1.38:

8 * 1.38 = 11.04
0.314 * 1.38 = let's compute 0.3 *1.38=0.414, 0.014*1.38=0.01932. So 0.414 +0.01932 = 0.43332. So total 11.04 + 0.43332=11.47332.

So numerator is approximately 11.47 J/mol.

Wait wait, no, R is in J/(mol·K), so the units would be correct.

So denominator is 0.000355 K^-1.

So ΔH = 11.47 / 0.000355 = ?

Compute 11.47 divided by 0.000355.

Hmm, 0.000355 is 3.55e-4. So 11.47 / 3.55e-4 = ?

Let me compute step by step.

11.47 / 0.000355 = 11.47 * (1 / 0.000355) = 11.47 * approx 2816.901 (since 1/0.000355 ≈ 2816.9).

So 11.47 * 2816.9 ≈ ?

Compute 10 *2816.9 =28,169.

1.47 *2816.9 ≈ let's compute 1 *2816.9 =2816.9, 0.47 * 2816.9 ≈ 1323. So total 2816.9 +1323=4139.9.

So total is 28,169 +4,139.9 =32,308.9 J/mol.

Which is about 32,309 J/mol, which is 32.3 kJ/mol.

Wait, the options are in the range of 20,000 to 40,000 J/mol, which is 20 to 40 kJ. So 32,309 is approximately 32,000 J/mol.

Looking at the options, option I is 32,000 J/mol. But wait, let me check the calculations again, because sometimes I might have made a mistake in the approximations.

Wait, let me go back. Let me recheck the steps.

1. Compute P2/P1: 0.526 / 0.132 = 3.9848. Correct.

2. ln(3.9848)= approx 1.383. Let me think again: let me remember that ln(3) is about 1.0986, ln(4)=1.386. So 3.9848 is 3.9848= about 4-0.0152. So ln(4) is 1.386, but since 3.9848 is 0.0152 less than 4. So the ln would be a bit less than 1.386. Maybe 1.383 or 1.382?

3. 1/T1 and 1/T2: T1=296.15, T2=331.15. So 1/296.15=0.003376, 1/331.15≈0.003021. So the difference is 0.000355. Correct.

4. Then, the equation: 1.383 = (ΔH /8.314) * 0.000355.

Wait, no. Wait the equation is 1.383 = (ΔH /8.314) * 0.000355? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, wait the equation is ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH/R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2). So (ΔH/R) = ln(...)/(1/T1 -1/T2).

Wait, no, I think I had it right the first time. Let me re-arrange.

ΔH = [ ln(P2/P1) * R ] / (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

Yes, that's correct. So plug in the numbers.

So [1.383 * 8.314 ] / 0.000355.

Compute 1.383 *8.314:

1 *8.314=8.314.

0.3 *8.314=2.4942.

0.08*8.314=0.66512.

0.003 *8.314=0.024942.

Adding them up: 8.314 +2.4942=10.8082; +0.66512=11.4733; +0.024942=11.4982.

So numerator is approximately 11.4982.

Denominator is 0.000355.

So 11.4982 / 0.000355 ≈ let's compute 11.4982 / 0.000355.

Same as 11.4982 * (1/0.000355) = 11.4982 * approx 2816.901.

So 11.4982 *2816.901.

Compute 10 *2816.901=28,169.01.

1.4982 *2816.901: Let's compute 1 *2816.901 =2816.901.

0.4982 *2816.901 ≈ compute 0.4 *2816=1126.4, 0.09 *2816≈253.44, 0.0082*2816≈23.07. Sum: 1126.4+253.44=1379.84 +23.07=1402.91.

So 1.4982 *2816.901≈2816.901 +1402.91=4219.81.

So total is 28,169.01 +4,219.81=32,388.82 J/mol.

So approximately 32,389 J/mol, which is about 32,400 J/mol. Looking at the options, option I is 32,000. But wait, let me check the options again.

The options are:

A:37,000
B:22,000
C:26,500
D:35,000
E:40,000
F:30,000
G:20,000
H:28,000
I:32,000
J:25,000

So the closest is option I:32,000. But wait, let me think if I made any miscalculations. Oh wait, wait another thing. The equation I used assumes that the vaporization is reversible, and that we're using the enthalpy of vaporization at the correct temperature. Also, in some sources, the Clausius-Clapeyron equation is written as ln(P2/P1) = -(ΔHvap/R)(1/T2 -1/T1), which would be the same as (ΔH/R)(1/T1 -1/T2). So that part seems correct.

Wait another thing. Let me double-check the calculation for 11.4982 / 0.000355.

Wait, 0.000355 is 3.55e-4. So 11.4982 / 3.55e-4 = 11.4982 / 0.000355.

Let me compute it as 11.4982 / 0.000355.

Let me write it as 11.4982 divided by 0.000355.

Alternatively, I can multiply numerator and denominator by 1e6 to eliminate decimals.

So (11.4982 *1e6) / (0.000355 * 1e6) )= 11,498,200 /355 = ?

Compute 11,498,200 /355.

355 *32,000 = 355 *32,000 = let's compute 355 *30,000=10,650,000. 355 *2,000=710,000. So total 11,360,000.

Subtracting from 11,498,200: 11,498,200 -11,360,000=138,200.

Now, 355 * 390= 355*(400-10)=142,000 -3,550=138,450.

But we have 138,200, which is 250 less than 138,450.

So 32,000 +390=32,390. But since 355*390=138,450, which is 250 more than 138,200, so it's 32,390 - (250/355)= approx 32,390 -0.704=32,389.3.

So about 32,389 J/mol.

So approx 32,400 J/mol, which is 32.4 kJ/mol.

Looking at the options, option I is 32,000 J/mol, which is very close. So the correct answer should be I.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me recheck the numbers.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the ln(P2/P1). Let's compute it more accurately. Let me think of it as ln(3.9848).

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator if I can. But since I can't, I'll have to approximate. Let's think of ln(3.9848) as follows.

We know that ln(4) is approximately 1.386294.

But 3.9848 is 4*(1 - 0.0038), because 4 -0.0152=3.9848. So 3.9848=4*(1-0.0038).

So ln(3.9848)=ln(4*(1-0.0038))=ln(4) + ln(1-0.0038).

We can use the approximation ln(1-x) ≈ -x -x²/2 -x³/3 ... for small x.

So x=0.0038. So ln(1-0.0038)= -0.0038 - (0.0038)^2/2 - ... ≈ -0.0038 - (0.00001444)/2 ≈ -0.0038 -0.00000722≈ -0.00380722.

So ln(3.9848)=1.386294 -0.00380722≈1.382487.

So more accurately, ln(P2/P1)=1.3825.

So using that number, let's recompute.

ΔH = (1.3825 *8.314) / (0.000355)

Compute numerator: 1.3825 *8.314.

1 *8.314=8.314.

0.3 *8.314=2.4942.

0.08 *8.314=0.66512.

0.0025 *8.314=0.020785.

Adding all: 8.314 +2.4942=10.8082; +0.66512=11.47332; +0.020785=11.494105.

So numerator is 11.4941.

Denominator is 0.000355.

So 11.4941 / 0.000355 =11.4941 * (1/0.000355)=11.4941 *2816.901.

As before, 11.4941 *2816.901.

We can compute 11 *2816.901=30,985.911.

0.4941 *2816.901≈ let's compute 0.4 *2816.901=1,126.76; 0.09 *2816.901=253.52; 0.0041*2816.901≈11.54.

So sum: 1,126.76 +253.52=1,380.28 +11.54≈1,391.82.

So total 30,985.911 +1,391.82≈32,377.73 J/mol.

So approximately 32,378 J/mol, which is about 32,400 J/mol, so 32,000 is the closest option, which is option I.

Wait, but let me make sure about the sign. Since vapor pressure increases with temperature, the enthalpy of vaporization should be positive, which matches our calculation.

So I think the answer is I:32,000 J/mol.
</think>

To determine the enthalpy change (∆H) for the vaporization of carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄) in the given temperature range, we use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right) = \frac{\Delta H}{
