Okay, so I've got this question here about finding the capital of a firm based on some given numbers. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that in accounting, the basic equation is Assets = Liabilities + Equity. Oh wait, capital is part of equity, right? So the capital here probably refers to the owner's equity or the firm's equity.

The question gives me total assets as $240,000, total liabilities as $100,000, and an income of $40,000 for one year. Hmm, wait, income is profit, right? So that's the net income for the year.

Wait, but how does income factor into the capital? I think I need to consider that the net income would increase the equity unless it's distributed as dividends. But the question doesn't mention dividends, so I guess we'll assume that the net income is retained.

So initially, the firm's equity before considering the income would be Assets minus Liabilities. Let me calculate that first. Assets are $240k, liabilities are $100k. So 240,000 - 100,000 equals $140,000. That's the equity before adding the net income.

But then the firm made $40,000 in income, so that profit would add to the equity. So the new equity, which is the capital, would be 140,000 + 40,000 = $180,000.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing things up. Oh wait, no, because the net income for the year increases the equity. So yes, that makes sense. So the total capital now is $180k.

Looking at the options, option H is $180,000. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me check if I made a mistake. Did I confuse revenue with net income? The question says income, which I'm assuming is net income. So yes, that's correct. So the calculation is right.

The capital of a firm is calculated using the accounting equation: 

\[
\text{Assets} = \text{Liabilities} + \text{Equity (Capital)}.
\]

Given:
- Total Assets = $240,000
- Total Liabilities = $100,000
- Net Income for the year = $40,000.

First, calculate the initial equity before adding the net income:

\[
\text{Initial Equity} = \text{Assets} - \text{Liabilities} = 240,000 - 100,000 = \$140,000.
\]

Next, add the net income to the initial equity to determine the total capital:

\[
\text{Total Capital} = \text{Initial Equity} + \text{Net Income} = 140,000 + 40,000 = \$180,000.
\]

Thus, the capital of the firm is **$180,000**.
