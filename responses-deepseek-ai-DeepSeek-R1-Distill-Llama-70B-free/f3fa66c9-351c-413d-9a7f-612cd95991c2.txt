The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

What is mutualism? Give three examples of this type of relationship.

Options:

A: Mutualism is a relationship where one species benefits and the other is harmed. Examples include: the clownfish and sea anemone, oxpeckers and rhinos, and honeybees and flowers.
B: Mutualism is a relationship where one species benefits and the other is unaffected. Examples include: barnacles on whales, remoras on sharks, and orchids growing on trees.
C: In the mutualistic type of relationship, both species benefit from each other. Examples include: Nitrogen-fixing bacteria of the genus Rhizobium and legumes, lichens which are a combination of fungi and algae, and ants and aphids or scale insects.
D: Only one species benefits in mutualism
E: Mutualism is a relationship where both species are harmed. Examples include: parasitic wasps and caterpillars, mistletoe and trees, and tapeworms and mammals.
F: Mutualism is a type of relationship where both species compete for resources. Examples include: different tree species in a forest, coral and algae, and various species of scavengers on a carcass.
G: Mutualism does not occur in plants
H: Mutualism refers to the relationship between predator and prey. Examples include: cheetahs and gazelles, wolves and deer, and hawks and rodents.
I: Examples of mutualism include lion and gazelle, cat and mouse, wolf and rabbit
J: Examples of mutualism include sharks and remoras, crocodiles and plover birds, and humans and domesticated animals.

Okay, so I've got this question about mutualism and examples of it. Hmm, mutualism... I remember that in biology, there are different types of symbiotic relationships. Let me think. Symbiosis is when two different species live together in close association. The types are mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism.

Wait, mutualism is when both species benefit, right? So both organisms gain something from each other. Yeah, that's mutualism. Commensalism is when one benefits and the other isn't affected. Like barnacles on a whale maybe. And parasitism is when one benefits and the other is harmed, like tapeworms in a host.

So the question is asking what mutualism is and gives three examples. Let me look at the options.

Option A: Says mutualism is where one benefits and the other is harmed. No, that's parasitism. So A is incorrect.

Option B: One benefits, the other unaffected. That's commensalism. B is wrong.

Option C: Both benefit. Yes, that's mutualism. The examples given are Rhizobium bacteria and legumes. Oh right, Rhizobia fix nitrogen for the plant, and the plant provides carbohydrates. Then lichens, which are fungi and algae together. The fungi provide structure, the algae do photosynthesis. And ants and aphids... I think ants protect aphids from predators, and aphids secrete honeydew which the ants eat. So yes, all mutualistic examples. So C seems correct.

Option D: Only one benefits. No, that's not mutualism. D is incorrect.

Option E: Both are harmed. That doesn't make sense. Maybe that's competition? Or maybe an incorrect statement. E is wrong.

Option F: Both compete. No, mutualism isn't competition. F is wrong.

Option G: Mutualism doesn't occur in plants. That's not true. Like the Rhizobium and legumes example. So G is wrong.

Option H: Predator-prey relationship. No, that's not mutualism. Predators benefit, prey are harmed. So H is wrong.

Option I: Lion and gazelle? That's predator-prey, not mutualism. I is wrong.

Option J: Sharks and remoras. Remoras clean the shark's teeth, so the remora gets food, shark gets cleaned. That's mutualism. Crocodiles and plover birds—birds eat leftover food in the crocodile's mouth, so both benefit. Humans and domesticated animals—like dogs helping with tasks and getting food/shelter. So J's examples fit mutualism. Wait, but what's the definition in J? The question is about mutualism, so the definition has to be correct.

Looking back, the first part of each option is the definition. Option C says mutualism is where both species benefit, which is correct, and gives good examples. Option J gives correct examples but what does it say? Let me check the question again. The options are A-J, each giving a definition and examples.

Wait, looking again. Option C's examples are Rhizobium and legumes, lichens, and ants and aphids. All correct mutualism examples. Option J's examples are sharks/remoras, crocodiles/plover, humans/domesticated animals—all mutualistic. So both C and J have correct examples, but what about their definitions?

Option C's definition is correct—both species benefit. Option J's first line isn't provided in the options, but looking back, the user's message shows the options. Oh, wait in the options, option J just lists examples. Wait no, the options are each a full statement. Let me read the options again.

Wait, the question is 'What is mutualism? Give three examples.' So each option starts with a definition, followed by examples.

So Option C starts correctly, stating mutualism is where both species benefit. And the examples are correct.

Option J's first part says, "Examples of mutualism include...", but wait, the actual option J starts with "Examples of mutualism..." but that's not a definition. Wait, no, looking back:

The options are:

A: Mutualism is a relationship where one species benefits and the other is harmed... (wrong, that's parasitism)

B: Mutualism is a relationship where one benefits, the other unaffected... (commensalism)

C: Correct definition and examples.

J: "Examples of mutualism include..." So J doesn't provide a definition, it just gives examples. But the question asks what mutualism is, so the correct option must both define it correctly and provide correct examples.

So option C is correct because it defines mutualism properly and has accurate examples. Option J doesn't define it, only gives examples, so it doesn't answer the question fully.

So the answer should be C.

Mutualism is a type of symbiotic relationship where both species involved benefit from each other. The correct definition is provided in option C, which states: "In the mutualistic type of relationship, both species benefit from each other." The examples given in option C—Nitrogen-fixing bacteria of the genus Rhizobium and legumes, lichens (a combination of fungi and algae), and ants and aphids—are all accurate representations of mutualism. 

Option J lists examples of mutualism, such as sharks and remoras, crocodiles and plover birds, and humans and domesticated animals, which are also correct. However, option J does not provide a definition of mutualism, whereas the question explicitly asks for both a definition and examples. Therefore, option C is the most complete and accurate answer.

Answer: C
