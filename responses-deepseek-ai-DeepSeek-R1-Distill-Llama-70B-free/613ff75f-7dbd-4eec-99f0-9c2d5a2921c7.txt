Okay, so I've got this question about which company holds an annual self-named 'Bake-Off'. The options are from A to J, with various food companies listed. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, I remember that a Bake-Off is a competition where people bake things, and sometimes companies host these events. I think I've heard of the Pillsbury Bake-Off before. Pillsbury is a well-known brand, especially for things like flour and baking products. They've been around for a long time, so it makes sense they might have a long-standing event like this.

Wait, but I should make sure I'm not mixing it up with Betty Crocker. Betty Crocker is another big name, and they're associated with baking too. But I think Betty Crocker is more about the recipes and maybe the mixes, not necessarily the Bake-Off. Or wait, is Betty Crocker a brand under General Mills? I think that's right. So maybe General Mills has the Bake-Off? No, I think the Bake-Off is specifically called the Pillsbury Bake-Off. 

Let me think of other companies. Duncan Hines is known for cake mixes and maybe some baking products, but I don't recall them hosting a major Bake-Off. Pepperidge Farm does cookies and bread, but not sure about a Bake-Off. Sara Lee is more into baked goods like bread and pastries, but again, not the Bake-Off. Quaker Oats is more about oats and cereals, so probably not. Kellogg's is cereals, Keebler is cookies, Nabisco is snacks like Oreos and Chips Ahoy. 

So narrowing it down, Pillsbury fits because I definitely remember hearing about the Pillsbury Bake-Off as a major event. They have contests where people submit recipes, and there's a prize, like the famous Pillsbury Doughboy. I think the grand prize is like a lot of money and maybe a kitchen makeover or something. 

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is Pillsbury. So that's the one. I think that's the correct answer. The other options don't seem to fit as well. Like Betty Crocker is a brand, but I don't think they have their own Bake-Off named after them. Or wait, maybe I'm confusing it. No, I'm pretty sure it's Pillsbury that hosts the Bake-Off.

The Pillsbury Bake-Off is a well-known annual event hosted by Pillsbury, where participants submit their baking recipes to compete for prizes. This event is distinctively named after the company, making H: Pillsbury the correct answer.
