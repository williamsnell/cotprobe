Okay, so I have this math problem here: Simplify −4 + 7 • 3². Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can figure this out. 

First, I remember that in math problems, the order of operations is really important. I think it's often remembered by PEMDAS—Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction. So I should follow that order here.

Looking at the problem, there are no parentheses, so the next thing is exponents. The exponent here is 3 squared. So 3² is 3 multiplied by itself. That would be 3 * 3, which is 9. So I can rewrite the problem as −4 + 7 • 9.

Next up in the order of operations is multiplication. So I need to do 7 multiplied by 9. Let me calculate that. 7 times 9 is 63. So now the problem simplifies to −4 + 63.

Now, I just have to add −4 and 63. Wait, adding a negative number is the same as subtracting. So this is like 63 minus 4. 63 minus 4 is 59. So the result should be 59.

Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting again: 3 squared is 9. 7 times 9 is 63. Then adding -4 is the same as 63 - 4, which is 59. Yeah, that seems right.

Looking at the options provided, option G is 59. So that's the correct answer.

The problem requires simplifying −4 + 7 • 3² using the order of operations (PEMDAS). 

1. Calculate the exponent first: 3² = 9.  
2. Perform the multiplication: 7 • 9 = 63.  
3. Finally, add −4 to 63: 63 + (−4) = 59.

The correct answer is option G: 59.
