Question:

A man owned a piece of land with a run-down log cabin on it. He lost interest in it, letting tax bills pile up and failing to maintain it. In 1990, a homeless couple occupied the crumbling cabin. They restored it, fenced the perimeter, and maintained the grounds. They started paying the taxes, despite knowing there was an absentee owner. In 2000, the owner appeared and demanded that they pay rent. They agreed but stopped the payments two years later after consulting an attorney. The required statutory period in the state is 20 years. In 2011 the owner filed an ejectment action, asserting his ownership rights. Leaving aside any other theories or equities, can the couple prevail on a theory of adverse possession?

Options:

A: No, because the statutory period had not been met when the owner filed for ejectment.
B: Yes, because they maintained the grounds of the property.
C: Yes, because they had exclusive possession of the property.
D: Yes, because they were on the land for over 20 years.
E: Yes, because they owned the property due to paying the taxes on it.
F: No, because they missed some of the tax payments during that 20-year period.
G: No, because they knew there was an absentee owner.
H: Yes, because they made improvements to the property.
I: No, because the hostile possession was interrupted for two years when they paid rent.
J: No, because they did not have a legal claim to the property.

Okay, so I've got this question about adverse possession. Hmm, I remember that adverse possession is a legal doctrine that allows someone to gain title to a property if they meet certain conditions over a period of time. The key elements I think are that the possession has to be open, notorious, exclusive, hostile, and continuous for the statutory period.

The scenario here is about a man who owns a piece of land with a cabin. He lost interest, so taxes piled up, and the place wasn't maintained. Then in 1990, a homeless couple moves in. They restore the cabin, fence the perimeter, maintain the grounds, and start paying taxes even though they know there's an absentee owner. So they've been there since 1990, right?

In 2000, the owner shows up and asks for rent. They agree to pay but stop after two years because their attorney told them to. The statutory period in the state is 20 years. Then in 2011, the owner files an ejectment action. The question is whether the couple can prevail on adverse possession.

So, looking at the timeline: they started possession in 1990. The statutory period is 20 years, so that would end in 2010. But the owner filed the action in 2011. So, does that mean the 20-year period was met?

Wait, but what about the period when they paid rent. From 2000 to 2002, they were paying rent. That's two years. Does that interrupt the adverse possession?

I remember that for adverse possession, the possession must be continuous and without interruption. If they started paying rent, that might change the nature of their possession. Renting implies a landlord-tenant relationship, which is inconsistent with adverse possession. Because in adverse possession, the possessor must hold the property in a way that's hostile to the true owner's rightsâ€”like, without permission.

So from 1990 to 2000, they were there without permission. But from 2000 to 2002, they had the owner's permission by paying rent. That would break the continuity. So the period from 1990 to 2000 is 10 years, and then from 2002 to 2010 is 8 years. So that's a total of 18 years, which is less than the required 20.

Wait, but let me think again. They started in 1990, so 20 years would be up to 2010. But the time from 2000 to 2002 was when they were paying rent, so that period wouldn't count towards adverse possession. So their adverse possession was interrupted.

So the total time without interruption would be from 1990 to 2000 (10 years) and then from 2002 to 2011 (9 years), totaling 19 years. But the statutory period is 20 years, so they haven't met it yet when the owner filed in 2011.

Wait, no, the owner filed in 2011, so the last year would be 2011. But the statutory period is 20 years. So from 1990 to 2010 is 20 years. But their adverse possession was interrupted in 2000-2002. So the periods before and after that interruption wouldn't add up because the interruption breaks the continuity.

So the total time they had adverse possession is 10 years (1990-2000) plus 8 years (2002-2010) equals 18 years. So when the owner files in 2011, they've only had 18 years of adverse possession, which is less than the 20 required.

Alternatively, maybe the period after 2002 resumes the adverse possession. But I think once they paid rent, that's a break. So the continuity is lost, and they'd have to start over after 2002.

Wait, but actually, paying rent implies that they acknowledged the owner's title, so that's not hostile anymore. So from 2000 to 2002, their possession was permissive, not adverse. So that period doesn't count, and they can't tack it on to the earlier period because the permission breaks the continuity.

So their adverse possession is only 1990-2000 (10 years) and 2002-2011 (9 years). But that's 19 years total, but since the time from 2000-2002 was with permission, the periods aren't continuous. So in 2011, they haven't met the 20-year requirement because the time isn't continuous.

Wait, but the statutory period is 20 years. If they started in 1990, adding 20 years would take us to 2010. So by 2010, they would have had 20 years. But wait, their period was interrupted. So let me think again.

From 1990 to 2000: 10 years adverse.

2000-2002: paying rent, so that's 2 years where it's not adverse.

2002-2010: 8 more years adverse.

So total adverse time is 18 years. The statutory period is 20, so they haven't met it yet. Thus, when the owner sues in 2011, the 20-year period hasn't been satisfied because of the interruption.

So looking at the options. The question is whether the couple can prevail on adverse possession.

Option A: No, because the statutory period had not been met when the owner filed for ejectment.

Wait, the time they were paying rent interrupted their adverse possession. So their total adverse time is 18 years when the owner sues in 2011. So the statutory period of 20 hasn't been met.

So the answer would be A: No, because the statutory period had not been met.

But wait, another point: adverse possession requires that the possession be hostile. If they knew there was an absentee owner, does that affect the hostility?

In some jurisdictions, good faith belief in ownership can negate hostility, but in others, knowledge that the owner is absent might not matter as long as they're possessing without permission. So in this case, they knew there was an absentee owner, but they didn't have permission. So their possession was hostile.

But that's not the main issue here. The main issue is the interruption in the statutory period. Because they paid rent for two years, their adverse possession was interrupted, so they can't add the periods together.

So the statutory period is 20 years, and they didn't meet it when the owner filed in 2011.

So the correct answer is A.

To determine whether the couple can prevail on a theory of adverse possession, we must analyze the elements of adverse possession: the possession must be open, notorious, exclusive, hostile, and continuous for the statutory period of 20 years. 

The couple began possessing the property in 1990 without the owner's permission, restoring the cabin, fencing the perimeter, and paying taxes. This possession was hostile, as they knowingly occupied the property without the owner's consent. However, in 2000, the owner demanded rent, and the couple agreed to pay rent from 2000 to 2002. During this period, their possession became permissive, as paying rent establishes a landlord-tenant relationship, which is inconsistent with adverse possession. This interruption breaks the continuity of their adverse possession.

The statutory period requires continuous adverse possession for 20 years. Here, the couple's adverse possession occurred from 1990 to 2000 (10 years) and then from 2002 to 2011 (9 years). However, the interruption from 2000 to 2002 means the periods cannot be combined to meet the 20-year requirement. By 2011, when the owner filed the ejectment action, the couple had only accumulated 19 years of adverse possession, which is insufficient to meet the statutory period.

Thus, the couple cannot prevail on a theory of adverse possession because the statutory period had not been met when the owner filed the action.
