Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about the wavelengths of a photon and an electron, each having a kinetic energy of 1 eV. Hmm, I remember that photons and electrons have different relationships between their energy and wavelength.

Let's break it down. For the photon part, I think the energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by the equation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. Oh wait, right, E is in joules, but here the energy is given in electron volts (eV), so I might need to convert that.

Wait, I remember there's a conversion factor where 1 eV is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 joules. So for a photon with 1 eV, E = 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

Planck's constant h is about 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is 3.00 x 10^8 m/s. Plugging these into E = hc/λ, I can solve for λ.

So rearranging, λ = hc/E. Let's compute that. Let me calculate the denominator first: E is 1.602e-19 J.

So hc is 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then divide that by E, which is 1.602e-19 J.

So λ = (1.9878e-25) / (1.602e-19) ≈ approximately 1.24e-6 meters. Wait, converting meters to nanometers, since 1 nm is 1e-9 m. So 1.24e-6 m is 1240 nm. Oh right, I've heard that 1 eV corresponds roughly to a wavelength of about 1240 nm for photons. So the photon's wavelength should be around 1240 nm.

Now, for the electron, it's a bit trickier. Electrons have mass, so their kinetic energy is related to their momentum, and hence their wavelength via de Broglie's equation: λ = h / p, where p is momentum.

The kinetic energy (KE) for the electron is given by KE = (1/2)mv². But it's easier to relate KE to momentum. Since p = mv, then v = p/m. Substitute into KE: KE = p²/(2m). So solving for p, p = sqrt(2m KE).

Wait, but the KE is in eV, so I need to convert that to joules again. KE = 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

The mass of the electron m is about 9.109e-31 kg.

So p = sqrt(2 * m * KE) = sqrt(2 * 9.109e-31 kg * 1.602e-19 J).

Let me compute that step by step. 2 * 9.109e-31 is approximately 1.8218e-30. Multiply by 1.602e-19: 1.8218e-30 * 1.602e-19 = about 2.921e-49.

Taking the square root of 2.921e-49 gives sqrt(2.921e-49) ≈ 5.405e-25 kg·m/s.

Now, de Broglie wavelength λ = h/p = 6.626e-34 / 5.405e-25.

Calculating that: 6.626e-34 / 5.405e-25 ≈ 1.226e-9 meters, which is 1.226 nanometers. Wait, no, wait: 1.226e-9 m is 1.226 nm? Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, 1e-9 meters is 1 nm. So 1.226e-9 m is 1.226 nm. Wait, no, wait: no, wait! 1e-9 m is 1 nm, so 1.226e-9 m is 1.226 nm. Hmm, but I thought the electron wavelength was in the order of angstroms, which are 0.1 nm. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the numbers. Let me recalculate p.

KE = 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

p = sqrt(2 * m * KE) = sqrt( 2 * 9.109e-31 kg * 1.602e-19 J )

So 2 * 9.109e-31 = 1.8218e-30.

1.8218e-30 * 1.602e-19 = let's compute 1.8218 * 1.602 = approximately 2.92, and exponents: e-30 * e-19 = e-49. So 2.92e-49.

Square root of 2.92e-49 is sqrt(2.92) * 1e-24.5. Wait, sqrt(1e-49) is 1e-24.5, which is 3.16e-25. So sqrt(2.92) is about 1.708, so 1.708 * 3.16e-25 = approx 5.40e-25 kg m/s.

So p ≈ 5.4e-25 kg m/s.

Then λ = h/p = 6.626e-34 / 5.4e-25 = (6.626 /5.4 ) * 1e-9.

6.626 /5.4 is approximately 1.227. So λ ≈ 1.227e-9 m, which is 1.227 nm. Wait, that's 1.227 nanometers. But wait, that can't be right because I thought electrons with 1 eV have much shorter wavelengths. Hmm, maybe I messed up the exponent.

Wait, wait, let me redo the calculation of p more carefully.

Compute 2 * m * KE:

m = 9.10938356e-31 kg

KE = 1.602176634e-19 J.

So 2 * 9.10938356e-31 = 1.82187671e-30.

Multiply by KE: 1.82187671e-30 * 1.602176634e-19 = ?

1.82187671e-30 * 1.602176634e-19 = (1.82187671 * 1.602176634) * 1e-49.

Calculate 1.82187671 * 1.602176634.

Let me compute 1.82187671 * 1.602176634:

Approximately 1.82187671 * 1.602176634.

1.8 * 1.6 = 2.88, 0.02187671 * 1.6 is about 0.035, and 1.8 * 0.002176634 is about 0.0039, and 0.02187671 * 0.002176634 is negligible.

So sum is about 2.88 + 0.035 + 0.0039 = ~2.9189.

So the product is approximately 2.9189e-49.

So p = sqrt(2.9189e-49) = sqrt(2.9189) * sqrt(1e-49) = 1.7087 * 1e-24.5.

Wait, 1e-49 is (1e-24.5)^2. Because 24.5 *2 is 49. So sqrt(1e-49) is 1e-24.5, which is 3.1623e-25.

So p = 1.7087 * 3.1623e-25 = approx 5.40e-25 kg m/s.

So p ≈ 5.40e-25 kg m/s.

Then λ = h / p = 6.62607015e-34 / 5.40e-25.

6.62607e-34 / 5.40e-25 = (6.62607 /5.40) * 1e-9.

6.62607 /5.4 ≈ 1.2268.

So λ ≈ 1.2268e-9 meters, which is 1.2268 nanometers.

Wait, that's 1.2268 nm. But wait, I thought for 1 eV, the electron wavelength is about 1.2 nm? Or was it 0.12 nm? No, wait, 1 eV is a low energy; higher energy electrons have shorter wavelengths. So for 1 eV, the wavelength should be longer than for higher energies. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing the numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the formula λ (in Ångströms) ≈ sqrt(150/(Voltage)). Wait, wait, there's a shortcut formula. I remember that the electron wavelength can be approximated using λ (Å) ≈ 12.3 / sqrt(V), where V is the accelerating voltage in volts. But wait, that's when the kinetic energy is equal to eV, right?

So if V is 1 V, then λ ≈ 12.3 / 1 = 12.3 Å. Oh wait, but 1 Å is 0.1 nm. So 12.3 Å is 1.23 nm. Hmm, which matches the earlier calculation of approximately 1.2268 nm.

So that's about 1.23 nm for the electron.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option E says photon wavelength is 1239.8 nm, electron is 0.01239 nm. That can't be right because 0.01239 nm is 0.012 nm, which is 1.2 Angstrom, which would be for a higher voltage, like 100 V or something.

Option I says photon 1240 nm, electron 0.012 nm. Again, that's 0.012 nm, which is way too small for 1 eV.

Wait, option H: photon 1239.8 nm, electron 1.226 nm. Oh, that's in line with our calculations. Photon about 1240 nm, electron about 1.226 nm.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option E: photon 1239.8 nm (close to our 1240), electron 0.01239 nm. That's 0.012 nm, which is 1.2 Angstrom, which doesn't match. Wait, no, that can't be. Because 1 eV would give a longer wavelength.

Wait, looking again. Option E's electron wavelength is 0.01239 nm, which is 0.012 nm, which is 1.239 Angstrom. That's way too small, as the approximation gives about 12.3 Angstrom (1.23 nm) for 1 eV.

So looking at the options:

Option H: photon 1239.8 nm, electron 1.226 nm. That seems correct.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option H: Photon wavelength = 1239.8 nm, Electron wavelength = 1.226 nm.

Yes, that fits our calculations. So the correct answer should be option H.

But wait, let me check the other options.

Option I: Photon 1240 nm, Electron 0.012 nm. That's 0.012 nm, which is 1.2 Angstrom, which is way off. So not option I.

So the correct option is H.

To determine the wavelengths of a photon and an electron, each having a kinetic energy of 1 eV, we use the following relationships:

### Photon Wavelength
The energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by the equation:

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

Where:
- \( E \) is the energy in joules,
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) is Planck's constant,
- \( c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) is the speed of light,
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength in meters.

For \( E = 1 \, \text{eV} \), we convert to joules:  
\[
1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

Rearranging for \( \lambda \):  
\[
\lambda = \frac{hc}{E}.
\]

Substituting the values:  
\[
\lambda = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3.00 \times 10^8)}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 1.24 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} = 1240 \, \text{nm}.
\]

Thus, the photon wavelength is approximately **1240 nm**.

### Electron Wavelength
The wavelength of an electron is determined using de Broglie's equation:

\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{p},
\]

Where \( p \) is the momentum of the electron. The momentum can be derived from the kinetic energy:

\[
p = \sqrt{2mE},
\]

Where:
- \( m = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \) is the mass of the electron,
- \( E = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \) is the kinetic energy in joules.

Substituting:  
\[
p = \sqrt{2(9.109 \times 10^{-31})(1.602 \times 10^{-19})}.
\]

First, calculate \( 2mE \):  
\[
2mE = 2(9.109 \times 10^{-31})(1.602 \times 10^{-19}) \approx 2.92 \times 10^{-49}.
\]

Taking the square root:  
\[
p = \sqrt{2.92 \times 10^{-49}} \approx 5.40 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

Now, calculate \( \lambda \):  
\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{5.40 \times 10^{-25}} \approx 1.226 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} = 1.226 \, \text{nm}.
\]

Thus, the electron wavelength is approximately **1.226 nm**.

---

### Matching with Options
From the calculations:
- Photon wavelength = 1240 nm,
- Electron wavelength = 1.226 nm.

The correct option is **H**:  
- Photon wavelength = 1239.8 nm,  
- Electron wavelength = 1.226 nm.

This matches our results closely.

**Answer: H**
