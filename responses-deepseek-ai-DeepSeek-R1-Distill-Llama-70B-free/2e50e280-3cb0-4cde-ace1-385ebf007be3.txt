Question:

Johnstown Mills manufactures cotton fabrics. Overhead is allocated to each department according to the ratio of total overhead to the total prime cost. During February, total direct labor costs came to $216,000 and the cost of materials to $84,000. The total overhead for the month was $45,000. Find the overhead percent of prime cost to be charged to each department. Then find the amount of overhead to be charged to the Design Department with a prime cost of $18,500.

Options:

A: 20%, $3,700
B: 22%, $4,070
C: 18%, $3,330
D: 30%, $5,550
E: 10%, $1,850
F: 25%, $4,625
G: 28%, $5,180
H: 15%, $2,775
I: 35%, $6,475
J: 12%, $2,220

Okay, so I've got this accounting problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The company is Johnstown Mills, and they make cotton fabrics. The question is about overhead allocation based on the ratio of total overhead to total prime cost. 

Alright, I remember that prime cost is the sum of direct materials and direct labor. So first, I need to calculate the total prime cost for the month. The problem gives me the direct labor costs as $216,000 and materials as $84,000. So, adding those together should give me the prime cost.

Let me do that math: 216,000 plus 84,000. Hmm, 216 + 84 is 300, so $300,000 total prime cost. Got it.

Next, the total overhead for the month is $45,000. So the overhead percentage is calculated by dividing the total overhead by the total prime cost, right? So that would be 45,000 divided by 300,000. Let me compute that. 45 divided by 300 is 0.15, which is 15%. So the overhead percent is 15% of the prime cost.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Oh wait, the question says the overhead is allocated according to the ratio of total overhead to total prime cost. So yes, that's the overhead percentage. So 15% makes sense.

Now the second part is finding the amount of overhead to charge to the Design Department. Their prime cost is $18,500. So I need to apply the 15% overhead rate to this amount.

Let me calculate 15% of 18,500. 15% is 0.15. So 18,500 * 0.15. Hmm, 18,000 * 0.15 is 2,700, and 500 * 0.15 is 75. So adding those together, 2,700 +75 is 2,775. So the overhead charged is $2,775.

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches. The overhead percent is 15%, and the amount is $2,775. That would be option H. Let me check the options again to be sure.

Options:
H: 15%, $2,775. Yep, that's the one.

The total prime cost is calculated by adding direct labor ($216,000) and direct materials ($84,000), resulting in $300,000. The overhead percentage is determined by dividing total overhead ($45,000) by total prime cost ($300,000), which equals 15%. For the Design Department, with a prime cost of $18,500, the overhead charged is 15% of $18,500, amounting to $2,775. 

The correct answer is:

H: 15%, $2,775.
