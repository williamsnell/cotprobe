Okay, so I have to calculate the entropy of vaporization of chloroform at its normal boiling point. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, entropy of vaporization... I remember that entropy change (ΔS) is related to the enthalpy change (ΔH) and temperature (T) by the formula ΔS = ΔH / T. Oh right, that's for a phase change at the boiling point, where the process is reversible.

So the given data here is the enthalpy of vaporization (ΔHvap) as 29.4 kJ/mol. Oh wait, the units are in kJ, but I need the entropy in J, so I should convert that to J by multiplying by 1000. So 29.4 kJ is 29400 J.

The temperature is given as 334.88 K. That's the normal boiling point, so that's the temperature at which this process occurs. So I can plug these into the formula.

Let me write that out: ΔS = 29400 J/mol / 334.88 K. Let me calculate that.

Wait, let me do the division. 29400 divided by 334.88. Hmm, let me see. Maybe approximate it. 334.88 is roughly 335. So 29400 divided by 335. Let me do that:

335 * 87 = let's see, 335*80=26800, 335*7=2345. So 26800+2345=29145. Oh, that's close to 29400. The difference is 29400-29145=255. So 255/335 is about 0.76. So total is 87.76, approximately 87.8.

Wait, but wait, the exact calculation might be a bit different. Let me use a calculator approach.

29400 / 334.88 → Let's compute this.

Well, 334.88 goes into 29400 how many times? Let me do it step by step.

334.88 * 87 = ?

Let me compute 334 * 87 first. 300*87=26100, 34*87=2958 → 26100+2958=29058. Then, 0.88*87 is 76.56. So total is 29058 +76.56=29134.56. So 334.88 *87=29134.56, which is less than 29400.

The difference is 29400 -29134.56=265.44.

Now, how many times does 334.88 go into 265.44? It's less than once, so 265.44 /334.88 ≈ 0.792.

So total ΔS is 87 + 0.792 ≈ 87.792 J/(K·mol), which is approximately 87.8 J/(K·mol).

Looking at the options, option C is +87.8 J K^-1 mol^-1. So that's the answer. But wait, are there any other considerations?

Oh, wait, entropy is positive when a substance goes from liquid to gas because the disorder increases. So the value should be positive, which all the options are, but I just wanted to make sure.

Another thing to check: units. The enthalpy was given in kJ, which I converted to J by multiplying by 1000. Temperature is in Kelvin. So the units should work out to J/(K·mol), which matches the options.

So I think the correct answer is option C.

To calculate the entropy of vaporization of chloroform at its normal boiling point, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta S = \frac{\Delta H}{T}
\]

Here, the enthalpy of vaporization (\(\Delta H_{\text{vap}}\)) is given as \(29.4 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}\), which is converted to \(29400 \, \mathrm{J/mol}\). The temperature (\(T\)) is the boiling point, \(334.88 \, \mathrm{K}\). Substituting these values:

\[
\Delta S = \frac{29400 \, \mathrm{J/mol}}{334.88 \, \mathrm{K}}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\Delta S \approx 87.8 \, \mathrm{J \, K^{-1} \, mol^{-1}}
\]

This matches option C. The entropy of vaporization is positive, as expected, since the process involves an increase in disorder during the transition from liquid to gas. The units are consistent with the given data.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**C: +87.8 \(\mathrm{J \, K^{-1} \, mol^{-1}}\)**
