Question:

On September 1, a buyer contracted to purchase10,000 widgets from a seller for $1 per widget, delivery to be made no later than September 30. On September 15, a worldwide shortage of widgets caused a steep increase in the market price for widgets, so the seller decided not to deliver the widgets to the buyer. The seller sent a letter to the buyer, stating that the widgets would not be delivered. The buyer received the seller's letter on September 20. On October 15, the buyer filed suit against the seller for breach of contract. In determining the damages to which the buyer is entitled, which of the following would be taken as the market price of widgets?

Options:

A: The market price on September 15.
B: The market price on the date of filing the lawsuit.
C: The highest market price recorded between September 1 and October 15.
D: The average market price between September 1 and September 30.
E: The market price on October 15.
F: The market price on September 1.
G: The market price on September 20.
H: The market price on September 30.
I: The market price on the date the widgets were supposed to be delivered.
J: The market price on the date the contract was signed.

Okay, so I've got this question about contract law, specifically dealing with damages when a seller breaches a contract by not delivering goods. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The scenario is that a buyer contracted to buy 10,000 widgets at $1 each, with delivery by September 30. Then, on September 15, there's a worldwide shortage, causing prices to spike. The seller decides not to deliver and informs the buyer by letter, which the buyer receives on September 20. The buyer sues on October 15.

The question is about determining the market price for calculating damages. I remember that when a seller breaches a contract, the buyer can recover damages based on the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time and place for delivery. So the key here is to figure out when that market price is determined.

Wait, the contract says delivery by September 30. So the delivery was supposed to happen by that date. When the seller breaches, the buyer is entitled to cover the loss by purchasing substitute goods. The measure of damages is usually the difference between the market price at the time and place for delivery and the contract price.

So the seller refused to deliver on September 15, but the contract required delivery by September 30. The buyer received the letter on September 20, but I think the key date for determining the market price is the time when the goods should have been delivered, which is by September 30.

Hmm, but wait. Under the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code), which applies here because it's a sale of goods, the proper measure is the market price at the time and place for delivery. So even if the seller repudiated the contract earlier, the market price is assessed as of the delivery date. That makes sense because the buyer would have to go into the market at that time to buy replacement widgets.

So looking at the options:

Option H is the market price on September 30. That aligns with the delivery date specified in the contract. Option I says the market price on the date delivery was supposed to be made, which is the same as September 30, so that's essentially H.

Wait, looking back at the options, option I says "the date the widgets were supposed to be delivered." Since the delivery was to be made no later than September 30, that's the same as H, which is September 30.

But wait, another thought: I remember that when the seller anticipatorily repudiates the contract, the buyer can treat the breach as occurring when the repudiation is received. But in terms of measuring damages, the market price is still determined as of the time the goods were supposed to be delivered, not when the repudiation was received or when the lawsuit was filed.

So regardless of when the seller told the buyer they wouldn't deliver, the market price is assessed at the contracted delivery time. So September 30 is the correct date.

Looking at the options, option H is September 30, and option I is the same. Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

H: The market price on September 30.

I: The date the widgets were supposed to be delivered.

Wait, that's the same as H because the delivery was due by September 30. So H and I are the same. But looking back, the options are labeled A to J, so perhaps I misread. Let me check:

Looking again, the options are:

H: September 30.

I: The date the widgets were supposed to be delivered, which is September 30.

Wait, but perhaps the answer is H, because that's the specific date, whereas I is a general statement. But both H and I would point to the same date. Wait, no, the options are separate. So perhaps the correct answer is H.

Wait, but in the UCC, the relevant section is UCC §2-708, which deals with seller's remedies. For a buyer's damages when a seller breaches, it's under §2-709 or §2-710. Wait, no, for a buyer, when the seller breaches, the buyer's remedy is under §2-712, which talks about the measure of damages as the difference between market price and contract price.

Yes, UCC §2-712(2) says that the measure of damages is the market price at the time and place for tender, minus the contract price. So the time is when the goods were supposed to be delivered, which is September 30.

So the correct answer should be H, the market price on September 30.

So looking at the options, H is the market price on September 30, and I is the same, but phrased differently. Wait, no, looking back, option I says "the date the widgets were supposed to be delivered," which is September 30, so that's the same as H.

Wait, but the options are:

H: The market price on September 30.

I: The market price on the date the widgets were supposed to be delivered.

So both H and I are referring to the same date. But that can't be, because each option is a choice. So perhaps I made a mistake in the options. Let me recheck the user's question.

Looking back, the options are:

Options are A to J, with H being September 30, and I being the date delivery was supposed to be made.

Wait, perhaps in the question, option I says "the date the widgets were supposed to be delivered," which is the same as H. So both H and I would be correct, but that's impossible. Alternatively, perhaps I misread.

Wait no, looking again:

The options are:

H: The market price on September 30.

I: The market price on the date the widgets were supposed to be delivered.

Wait, that's the same as H because the supposed delivery date is September 30.

So that suggests that both H and I are correct, but that's not possible, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the options are as follows:

Option H: September 30.

Option I: The date the widgets were supposed to be delivered.

Wait, but that's the same. So perhaps the correct answer is H.

Wait, but perhaps the question is trying to get at the point that the market price is determined at the time of delivery, regardless of when the breach is communicated.

So the correct answer is H, September 30.

Alternatively, if the option I is present, perhaps that's the correct one because it's phrased as the intended delivery date.

Wait, but in the options presented, H is September 30, and I is the same. So perhaps the answer is H.

But wait, another thought: If the seller repudiated the contract on September 15, and the buyer received it on September 20, does that affect the measurement date? I think it doesn't because the UCC says the market price is determined as of the time the goods were to be delivered, not when the repudiation occurred.

Therefore, the correct market price is on September 30.

In contract law, when a seller breaches a contract by failing to deliver goods, the buyer is entitled to damages based on the difference between the contract price and the market price of the goods at the time and place the goods were supposed to be delivered. This principle is codified in the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) §2-712(2), which states that the measure of damages is the market price at the time and place for tender, minus the contract price.

In this scenario, the contract required delivery by September 30. The seller's repudiation on September 15 and the buyer's receipt of the letter on September 20 do not change the fact that the market price is determined as of the delivery date specified in the contract. The UCC explicitly ties the market price to the time and place of delivery, not to the date of repudiation or the filing of the lawsuit.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option H**: The market price on September 30. This aligns with the delivery date specified in the contract and is consistent with UCC §2-712(2).
- **Option I**: The market price on the date the widgets were supposed to be delivered. This is essentially the same as Option H, as the delivery date was September 30.

Both Options H and I refer to the same date, but since each option is distinct, the correct answer is **Option H**, as it directly specifies the market price on September 30.

Answer: H
