Okay, so I have this question about distinguishing between money wages and real wages. Hmm, I remember from my economics class that these terms are related but different. Let me think through what each means.

Money wages, I think, are the actual amount of money a worker receives for their work. Like, if someone earns $20 per hour, that's their money wage. It's the nominal value, right? So it's just the cash amount they get before considering any other factors.

Real wages, on the other hand, must be different. I recall that real wages take into account the purchasing power of the money. So it's not just how much money you have, but what you can actually buy with it. If prices go up, the same amount of money buys fewer goods, so real wages decrease even if money wages stay the same.

Wait, the question gives four options, A to D. Let me look at each one.

Option A says money wages are the value of work, real wages the cash received. No, that doesn't sound right. Money wages are the cash, and real wages are about purchasing power, not the value of work per se.

Option B claims they're the same, which can't be right. They're definitely different concepts.

Option C says money wages are what workers spend, real wages what they save. That doesn't make sense. Both terms relate to earnings, not spending or saving.

Option D states money wages are the cash per unit time, real wages the purchasing power. That matches what I was thinking. Money is the nominal amount, real is the actual value considering prices.

So the correct answer should be D.

The correct answer is:

D: Money wages are the amount of cash workers receive per unit of time on the job, while real wages indicate the actual value of the money wages or their purchasing power.
