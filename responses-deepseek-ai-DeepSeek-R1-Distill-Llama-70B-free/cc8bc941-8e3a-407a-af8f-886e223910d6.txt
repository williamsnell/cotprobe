Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking.

The setup is a container with an airtight piston. Initially, the pressure is 100 psia, and the temperature is 70°F. Then, 100 Btu of heat is transferred, and the piston moves, changing the volume from 0.5 ft³ to 2.0 ft³. We're assuming the gas behaves perfectly, so ideal gas laws apply. The questions are to find a) the change in internal energy, b) the final temperature, and c) the heat capacity of the process. The options are given from A to J.

Hmm, first, I think I should recall the first law of thermodynamics, which states that the change in internal energy (ΔU) is equal to the heat added (Q) minus the work done (W) by the system. So, ΔU = Q - W.

Wait, right. In this case, heat is being transferred into the system (since it's 100 Btu of heat), so Q is positive. Work done by the system is when the system expands against an external pressure, so the piston moving up implies the gas is doing work on the surroundings.

So I need to calculate the work done to find ΔU. Once I have that, I can find the final temperature using the ideal gas law, maybe. And for the heat capacity, I think it's the ratio of heat added to the temperature change, but I'm not sure about the exact definition here.

Let me jot down the given data:

Initial pressure, P1 = 100 psia.
Initial temperature, T1 = 70°F. I should convert this to absolute temperature, right? Because in gas laws, temperature needs to be in absolute units.
So, T1 = 70°F + 459.67 = 529.67°R.

Initial volume, V1 = 0.5 ft³.
Final volume, V2 = 2.0 ft³.
Heat added, Q = 100 Btu.

Assuming ideal gas, so PV = nRT. But since the amount of gas (n) isn't given, maybe it's constant, and we can work with specific variables, but perhaps I don't need n here.

Wait, but for work done during expansion, the formula is W = P_ext * ΔV, where P_ext is the external pressure. But wait, in this case, the pressure might not be constant. Hmm, but the process isn't stated, so I have to assume. The problem doesn't specify whether it's isobaric, isothermal, adiabatic, etc. So I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, the piston is moving, so I think it's a quasi-static process where the external pressure is almost equal to the internal pressure. But wait, the initial pressure is 100 psia, but what about the final pressure? Since the volume changes, the pressure must change as well. So perhaps I need to find the work done using integration, but that might be complicated without knowing the process.

Alternatively, maybe I can assume that the expansion is against a constant external pressure. But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the process is such that the external pressure is equal to the initial pressure. Or perhaps the process is a constant pressure process? Wait, but if the pressure stays constant, then the work would be PΔV. Let me think.

Wait, the problem doesn't specify the process, so perhaps I should proceed with the information given, assuming that the work can be calculated as P_ext * (V2 - V1). But what is P_ext here?

Alternatively, perhaps since the piston is moving, the external pressure is just slightly less than the system's pressure, allowing expansion. But without knowing the process, I might have to assume that the pressure is constant during expansion. Maybe the pressure remains at 100 psia throughout? Or perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the work using the initial pressure as the external pressure. Hmm, that could make sense.

So, if I take the external pressure to be the initial pressure, then the work done by the gas is W = P1 * (V2 - V1). Let me calculate that.

P1 = 100 psia. But wait, the units for work in the English system are typically in ft-lbf or Btu. Since 1 Btu is about 778 ft-lbf.

Wait, but the volume is in cubic feet, and pressure in psi. So the product P*V would be in psi*ft³, which can be converted to ft-lbf because 1 psi = 144 psig * (1 ft²) → Wait, no, 1 psi is 1 lbf per square inch. So 1 psi * 1 ft³ = 1 lbf * (144 in²)⁻¹ * 1 ft³. Wait, let me think again.

Actually, 1 cubic foot is 12 inches * 12 inches * 12 inches = 1728 cubic inches. So 1 ft³ = 1728 in³.

So, 1 psi = 1 lbf/in². So 1 psi * 1 ft³ = (1 lbf/in²) * (1728 in³) ) = 1728 lbf·in. Since 1 ft = 12 inches, 1 ft·lbf = 12 in·lbf. So 1728 in·lbf is 1728 / 12 = 144 ft·lbf.

So, 1 psi*ft³ = 144 ft·lbf. But 1 Btu is about 778.169 ft·lbf. So to convert psi·ft³ to Btu, I can do (P*V in psi-ft³) * 144 ft·lbf/(1 psi·ft³)) ) / 778.169 ft·lbf/Btu.

So, for this problem, W = P1*(V2-V1) = 100 psia * (2.0 - 0.5) ft³ = 100 * 1.5 = 150 psi·ft³.

Each psi·ft³ is 144 ft·lbf, so 150 * 144 = 21,600 ft·lbf. Now, convert that to Btu: 21,600 / 778.169 ≈ let's calculate.

21,600 / 778 ≈ 27.8 Btu. Wait, let me compute more accurately:

778.169 * 27 = 20,980.563 → 778.169*27.8 ≈ 778*27=20, 778*0.8=622.72 → total 20,980.72 + 622.72 = 21,603.44. So 27.8 * 778 ≈ 21,603, which is about what we have (21,600), so W ≈ 27.8 Btu.

Wait, but wait: the system is expanding, so work done by the system is positive. So W = 27.8 Btu. But in the first law, ΔU = Q - W. So Q is 100 Btu, W is 27.8 Btu. So ΔU = 100 - 27.8 = 72.2 Btu.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option E says ΔU is 72.2 Btu, which matches. So that's part a) done.

Next, part b), the final temperature. Since it's an ideal gas, internal energy depends only on temperature. So ΔU = n Cv (T2 - T1). But since we don't know n or Cv, perhaps we can find T2 using the work done and the first law.

Wait, but we can also use the ideal gas law. The process is such that the gas expands, so we can write the initial and final states.

Wait, but the pressure isn't constant, so maybe I should use the relation between internal energy and temperature. Since for an ideal gas, ΔU = n Cv ΔT.

But without knowing the number of moles, perhaps I can find the final temperature by using the ideal gas law and the work done.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the final pressure and then use the ideal gas law to find T2.

Wait, but without knowing the process, it's hard to find P2. Hmm.

Wait, but in the first part, I calculated the work as if the external pressure was constant at P1. But in reality, the external pressure might not be the same as the system's pressure during expansion. Hmm, but without knowing the process, perhaps the problem assumes that the expansion is against a constant external pressure equal to the initial system pressure. That is, the pressure drops as the system expands, but the external pressure is P1. So the work is P_ext * (V2 - V1) = 100 psia * 1.5 ft³ = 150 psi·ft³, which we already calculated as 27.8 Btu.

But if the process is isobaric (constant pressure), then the work would be PΔV, and the heat transfer would be Q = ΔU + W, but that's not the case here because the pressure must change as volume increases.

Wait, perhaps I should use the ideal gas law for the initial and final states. Let's denote n as the number of moles, which remains constant.

Initial state: P1 V1 = n R T1.

Final state: P2 V2 = n R T2.

But I have two equations and two unknowns (P2 and T2). But I also have the first law, which relates Q, ΔU, and W.

Wait, but I already calculated ΔU as 72.2 Btu. So ΔU is also equal to n Cv (T2 - T1).

But without knowing Cv, I'm stuck. Unless I can find another way. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate the work done to the internal energy change.

Wait, the work done by the system is W = 27.8 Btu. So Q = ΔU + W → 100 = ΔU + 27.8 → ΔU = 72.2 Btu, which we have.

But to find T2, I need another approach. Let's think about the ideal gas law again.

From the initial state:

n = (P1 V1) / (R T1).

Similarly, final state:

n = (P2 V2) / (R T2).

Since n is the same, set them equal:

(P1 V1) / (R T1) = (P2 V2) / (R T2).

Simplify R cancels:

P1 V1 / T1 = P2 V2 / T2 → P2 = P1 V1 T2 / (V2 T1).

But I don't know P2 yet. Alternatively, maybe I can express P2 in terms of T2 and substitute into another equation.

Wait, but I also have the first law, which gives ΔU in terms of T2. So perhaps I can combine these.

Wait, for an ideal gas, the internal energy change is ΔU = n Cv (T2 - T1).

But I can express n from the initial conditions: n = P1 V1 / (R T1).

So ΔU = (P1 V1 / (R T1)) * Cv * (T2 - T1).

Hmm, but I don't know Cv. Unless I can assume it's a monatomic gas or diatomic, but the problem doesn't specify. Wait, but perhaps Cv is given in terms of R. For example, for a monatomic ideal gas, Cv = (3/2) R, and for diatomic, Cv = (5/2) R. But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the work done using the ideal gas law and the process.

Wait, but without knowing the process (like isothermal, adiabatic, etc.), it's challenging. So maybe I should proceed with the assumption that the external pressure is constant at P1, so the work is P1ΔV, which I've calculated as 27.8 Btu.

Wait, but let me check the units again. I think I made a mistake in the unit conversion earlier.

Wait, P is in psia (pounds per square inch absolute), V in cubic feet. The product P*V gives units of psi·ft³, which can be converted to BTUs.

As I figured earlier, 1 psi·ft³ equals 144 ft·lbf, and 1 Btu is 778.169 ft·lbf. So 144 / 778.169 ≈ 0.1852 Btu per psi·ft³.

So, W = 100 psia * (2.0 - 0.5) ft³ = 100 * 1.5 = 150 psi·ft³.

Now, converting to Btu: 150 * 0.1852 ≈ 27.78 Btu. So W ≈ 27.78 Btu.

Thus, ΔU = Q - W = 100 - 27.78 ≈ 72.22 Btu. So that's the change in internal energy.

Now, for part b, finding the final temperature T2.

Since ΔU = n Cv (T2 - T1), and n can be expressed from the ideal gas law.

n = (P1 V1) / (R T1).

But I need Cv. Wait, perhaps I can express everything in terms of R. For an ideal gas, Cv = (f/2) R, where f is the degrees of freedom. But without knowing the type of gas, perhaps I should proceed differently.

Wait, perhaps I can use the ideal gas law in terms of U. Since U is a function of temperature only, maybe I can relate the initial and final states another way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the final pressure P2 using the ideal gas law and then relate it to the work done. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: since the process involves expansion and heat addition, perhaps I can use the combined first law and ideal gas equations.

Wait, let's think about the work done in a more precise way. If the process is reversible and the pressure varies, the work done is the integral of P dV from V1 to V2. But without knowing P as a function of V, that's not possible. So perhaps the earlier assumption of constant external pressure is the way to go.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the process is such that the pressure is constant. But in that case, the work would be PΔV, which is what I calculated earlier.

Wait, but if the process is at constant pressure, then Q would be the enthalpy change, but I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is adiabatic, but no, because heat is being added.

Hmm, maybe I should proceed with the data I have. I have ΔU = 72.2 Btu. So:

ΔU = n Cv (T2 - T1).

But n = (P1 V1)/(R T1) from the initial state.

So substituting:

ΔU = (P1 V1)/(R T1) * Cv * (T2 - T1).

But I don't know Cv. Alternatively, perhaps I can express Cv in terms of R for a specific gas model. Let's assume it's a monatomic gas, so Cv = (3/2) R. Or maybe diatomic, Cv = (5/2) R.

Wait, but without knowing, perhaps the problem assumes a specific value. Alternatively, perhaps the work done is related to the heat capacity.

Wait, another approach: the heat capacity at constant volume is Cv = (ΔU)/ (n ΔT). But without n, I can't proceed directly.

Wait, maybe using the relation between Cp and Cv. For ideal gases, Cp = Cv + R.

But I'm stuck. Maybe I can find T2 by using the work done and the ideal gas law.

Wait, but I'm not seeing a clear path here. Let me think differently.

If I can find n from the initial conditions:

n = (P1 V1) / (R T1).

Once I have n, I can find T2 from ΔU = n Cv (T2 - T1).

But without Cv, I can't proceed. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can express the work done in another way. The work done by the system is W = integral from V1 to V2 of P dV. For an ideal gas, P = n R T / V. But without knowing T as a function of V, this seems difficult.

Wait, but if the process is such that T changes in a certain way, perhaps I can relate it. Alternatively, perhaps it's an isothermal process, but no, because then ΔU would be zero, which contradicts our earlier calculation.

Wait, let me try assuming that the process is polytropic, but without knowing the exponent, that's not helpful.

Alternative approach: Let's think about the ideal gas law for both states.

Initial: P1 V1 = n R T1.

Final: P2 V2 = n R T2.

Divide the two equations: (P2 V2)/(P1 V1) = T2 / T1 → T2 = T1 * (P2 V2) / (P1 V1).

But I don't know P2. So I need another equation to relate P2 and T2.

From the first law, ΔU = Q - W. We have ΔU = 72.2 Btu, and W = 27.78 Btu.

But ΔU is also equal to n Cv (T2 - T1).

So, 72.2 Btu = n Cv (T2 - T1).

But n is from initial conditions: n = (P1 V1)/(R T1).

So substituting:

72.2 = (P1 V1 / (R T1)) * Cv * (T2 - T1).

Hmm, but I still have two unknowns, Cv and T2, unless I can express Cv in terms of R.

Wait, perhaps the gas is diatomic, so Cv = (5/2) R, but I can't be certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's monatomic, Cv = (3/2) R.

Wait, let's try monatomic first. So Cv = (3/2) R.

Then, 72.2 = (100 psia * 0.5 ft³ / (R * 529.67°R)) * (3/2 R) * (T2 - 529.67).

Simplify the terms. Let me compute each part.

First, compute n = (P1 V1)/(R T1) = (100 * 0.5) / (R * 529.67).

But R in what units? In the English system, R is 10.7316 psia·ft³/(lbmol·°R).

So, R = 10.7316 psia·ft³/(lbmol·°R).

So n =
