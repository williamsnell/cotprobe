Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the suitable diameter for a shaft under certain conditions. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question states that a shaft is distributing 160 horsepower at 400 rpm. It's subjected to sudden loading and heavy shock, with a maximum bending moment of 32,000 lbs-in. I need to find the diameter considering the ASME code and that there's a keyway involved.

First, I remember that the power transmitted by a shaft is related to the torque. The formula for power in horsepower is P = (Torque * rpm) / 5252. So I can rearrange that to find the torque. Let me calculate that.

Torque (T) = (P * 5252) / rpm. Plugging in the numbers: T = (160 hp * 5252) / 400 rpm. Let me compute that. 160 times 5252 is... 160 * 5000 is 800,000, and 160 * 252 is 40,320. So total is 840,320. Divided by 400 gives 2100 lb-in. Wait, torque is 2100 lb-in?

Wait, but the bending moment is 32,000 lb-in. That's way higher than the torque. So the bending moment is the main concern here.

I think the shaft's design is governed by both the torsional load (from the torque) and the bending moment. But since the bending moment is much larger, maybe the bending is the critical factor here. But I'm not entirely sure.

The ASME code probably provides some guidelines or formulas for calculating the required diameter. I recall that for shafts under combined torsion and bending, the equivalent stress is calculated using the formula: equivalent stress (σ) = sqrt( (16*T/(πd³))² + (32*M/(πd³))² ). But wait, that might be for combined loading. Alternatively, for a shaft with a keyway, there might be stress concentration factors to consider.

Wait, another approach: the ASME code might suggest using the maximum shear stress theory or another failure criterion. For power transmission shafts, sometimes the torsional shear stress is considered, and sometimes bending stress is considered if bending is significant.

The torque T is 2100 lb-in. The bending moment M is 32,000 lb-in. I need to find the diameter d that ensures the maximum stress (from both torsion and bending) is within allowable limits.

Alternatively, since the shaft is under sudden loading and shock, the design should account for that, which might mean using a higher factor of safety.

Wait, I think the formula for the diameter considering bending is d = (32*M/(π*σ))^(1/3). And for torsion, d = (16*T/(π*τ))^(1/3). But I'm not sure which one to use here. Since the bending moment is much larger, perhaps the bending stress will dominate.

But wait, the shaft has a keyway. The presence of a keyway increases the stress concentration, so I need to account for that. For a keyway, the stress concentration factor (K) for bending is around 2.5 to 3, and for torsion, it's about 1.5 to 2.5. But I'm not exactly sure about the exact values.

Wait, another thing: the ASME code might specify allowable stresses for shafts. For example, the allowable shear stress might be around 6000 psi for steady loads, but for shock loads, it's lower, maybe 3000 psi. Or perhaps it's based on the material's endurance limit.

Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me try to structure this.

1. Calculate torque from power and speed.
2. Consider both torque and bending moment.
3. Determine the equivalent stress considering both, including stress concentration from the keyway.
4. Find the diameter that keeps the stress within allowable limits.

So, step 1: Torque T is 2100 lb-in, as I calculated earlier.

Step 2: Bending moment M is 32,000 lb-in.

Now, the shaft is subjected to both torsion and bending. The maximum shear stress occurs when both are present. So the equivalent stress is the square root of the sum of squares of the shear stress from torsion and the bending stress.

Wait, but shear stress from torsion is different from bending stress. Torsion causes shear stress, and bending causes tensile (or compressive) stress. So they are different types of stress and might not simply add up in the same way.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider each separately and ensure that neither exceeds the allowable stress.

For torsional shear stress, the formula is τ = 16*T/(π*d³). For bending stress, σ = 32*M/(π*d³).

But wait, stress concentration factors come into play. So the actual stress would be multiplied by K for each.

So for torsion: τ_actual = K_torsion * (16*T)/(π*d³).
For bending: σ_actual = K_bending * (32*M)/(π*d³).

Now, what are the K values? For a keyway, in bending, K might be around 2 to 2.5 (I think it's about 2.5 for a standard keyseat). For torsion, K is lower, maybe around 1.5 to 2.

I'm a bit unsure, but let's proceed with K_bending = 2.5 and K_torsion = 1.5.

So the bending stress (σ) would be 2.5 * (32*M) / (π*d³).
The torsion shear stress (τ) would be 1.5 * (16*T) / (π*d³).

But since these are different types of stress, I'm not sure if I should combine them or treat them separately. Maybe the shaft's strength is limited by whichever is higher.

Wait, but in reality, when a shaft is subjected to both torsion and bending, the total stress can be found using the distortion energy theory, treating them as orthogonal stresses. So the equivalent stress would be sqrt(τ² + σ²). But since they are different types of stress, I'm not entirely sure if this is the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the ASME code allows considering the worst-case scenario between the two.

But maybe the key factor here is the bending moment because it's much larger than the torque. The torque is 2100 lb-in, and the bending moment is 32,000 lb-in, which is about 15 times larger. So bending might be the dominant factor.

So perhaps I should focus on the bending stress, applying the stress concentration factor.

Let's proceed with that.

The formula for bending stress is σ = (32*M) / (π*d³). But with a stress concentration factor K, it's σ = K*(32*M)/(π*d³).

Now, the allowable stress σ_allowable would depend on the material. But since the problem doesn't specify the material, I might have to assume a standard value. For shafts under shock loading, the allowable stress is typically lower. Let's say σ_allow = 20,000 psi. But I'm not entirely sure about this value; perhaps it's 30,000 psi. Wait, no, for shock or impact loads, the allowable stress is usually lower. For example, in machinery's handbook, for shafts under shock, the allowable stress might be around 6000-8000 psi. Wait, that seems too low. Alternatively, perhaps the allowable stress is based on the endurance limit of the material, but without knowing the material, I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the ASME code's formula without specific material properties, which might have default values.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is expecting me to use the horsepower and rpm to compute the torque, then compute the required diameter based on either torsion or bending, choosing the larger diameter.

But the bending moment is so much larger, so that would dictate a larger diameter.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the required diameter from both torsion and bending and take the larger one.

So let's compute the required diameter for each case.

First, for bending:

σ_bending = (32*M) / (π*d³). But with K=2.5, so σ = (32*32,000 * 2.5)/(π*d³).

Wait, no, the formula is K*(32*M)/(π d³). So plugging in M=32,000 lb-in, K=2.5.

So σ = (2.5 * 32 * 32,000) / (π d³).

Wait, wait, no, the formula is σ = (32*M) / (π d³) multiplied by K.

So σ = (32 * 32,000) / (π d³) * 2.5.

Compute numerator: 32 *32,000 = 1,024,000. Then multiply by 2.5: 2,560,000.

So σ = 2,560,000 / (π d³).

Now, if the allowable stress is σ_allow, then:

d³ = 2,560,000 / (π σ_allow).

Similarly, for torsion:

τ = (16*T)/(π d³) * K_torsion.

T is 2100 lb-in, K_torsion is 1.5.

So τ = (16 * 2100) / (π d³) *1.5.

16*2100 = 33,600. Multiply by 1.5 gives 50,400.

So τ = 50,400 / (π d³).

Now, if the allowable shear stress is τ_allow, then:

d³ = 50,400 / (π τ_allow).

But without knowing σ_allow and τ_allow, I can't proceed. So perhaps the problem expects me to use a single allowable stress value, combining both, or maybe the problem is designed so that one is the limiting factor.

Wait, perhaps the ASME code provides a formula that combines both, but I'm not remembering it correctly. Alternatively, maybe the problem simplifies it by considering only bending because it's the dominant load.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the torque to find the diameter for torsion, ignoring bending, but that doesn't make sense because the bending moment is much larger.

Wait, maybe I should compute the equivalent diameter considering both.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants me to use the formula for shaft diameter under power transmission, which is d = ( (16 * T) / (π τ) )^(1/3).

But again, without knowing τ, I can't proceed. Unless the problem assumes a certain allowable stress.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the standard allowable shear stress for shafts under shock loading. From what I remember, for shafts, the allowable shear stress can vary, but a common value for shock or heavy loads is around 6000 psi. But I'm not certain.

Assuming τ_allow = 6000 psi, then for torsion:

d³ = (16*T*K_torsion) / (π τ_allow).

Plugging in T=2100, K=1.5:

16*2100=33,600. Multiply by 1.5 gives 50,400.

So d³ = 50,400 / (π *6000).

Compute denominator: π*6000≈18,849.56.

So d³≈50,400 / 18,849.56 ≈2.676.

So cube root of 2.676 is about 1.4 inches. That seems too small, especially considering the bending moment.

Alternatively, maybe I'm using the wrong allowable stress. Perhaps for bending, the allowable stress is higher.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem expects me to use the combined stress approach.

So the equivalent stress would be sqrt( (16T/(π d³))² + (32M/(π d³))² ).

But with stress concentration factors:

So sqrt( (K_t * 16T/(π d³))² + (K_b *32M/(π d³))² ) <= σ_allow.

Assuming K_t=1.5 (for torsion) and K_b=2.5 (for bending).

So let's plug in the numbers.

The expression becomes sqrt( (1.5*16*2100/(π d³))² + (2.5*32*32,000/(π d³))² ) <= σ_allow.

Compute each term:

First term inside sqrt:

1.5*16*2100 = 1.5 * 33,600 = 50,400. So (50,400/(π d³))².

Second term:

2.5 *32 *32,000 = 2.5 * 1,024,000 = 2,560,000. So (2,560,000/(π d³))².

So the expression is sqrt( (50,400^2 + 2,560,000^2) ) / (π d³) ) <= σ_allow.

Compute numerator inside sqrt:

50,400^2 = 2,540,160,000.

2,560,000^2 = 6,553,600,000,000.

Adding them: 6,553,600,000,000 + 2,540,160,000 ≈6,556,140,160,000.

Square root of that is sqrt(6.55614016e12) ≈2,560,400 (approximately, because 2,560,000^2 is 6.5536e12, so this would be a bit more, say ~2,560,500).

So sqrt(6.556e12) ≈2,560,500.

So the expression becomes 2,560,500 / (π d³) <= σ_allow.

Solving for d³: d³ >= 2,560,500 / (π σ_allow).

But again, without knowing σ_allow, I'm stuck. Maybe I should assume a certain allowable stress.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the bending moment as the primary consideration. Let's try that.

Using the bending formula with stress concentration:

σ = K * (32 M) / (π d³).

Let me assume that the allowable stress σ_allow is, say, 30,000 psi. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes a certain value, maybe 20,000 psi.

Plugging in M=32,000 lb-in, K=2.5:

σ = 2.5 *32 *32,000 / (π d³).

Compute numerator: 2.5 *32 =80, 80 *32,000=2,560,000.

So σ = 2,560,000 / (π d³) <= σ_allow.

If I set σ_allow to 30,000 psi:

2,560,000 / (π d³) =30,000.

Solving for d³: d³ = 2,560,000 / (30,000 * π) ≈2,560,000 / (94,247.78) ≈27.15.

So d ≈ cube root of 27.15 ≈3 inches.

But wait, the options don't have 3 inches. The closest is option D:3½ in. or others. But let's double-check.

Wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation.

Wait, 30,000 psi is the allowable stress. But maybe for shock loading, the allowable is lower, say 20,000 psi.

So d³ = 2,560,000 / (20,000 * π) =2,560,000 /62,831.85 ≈40.76.

Cube root of 40.76 is about 3.43 inches. So around 3.43 inches. None of the options exactly match that, but let's look.

The options are:

A:5, B:4, C:3 7/8 (~3.875), D:3½ (3.5), H:3¾ (3.75), etc.

Wait, 3.43 is closest to 3.5 in., which is option D. But wait, maybe the allowable stress is higher. Let me try with 40,000 psi.

d³=2,560,000/(40,000 * π)=2,560,000/(125,663.7)=~20.36.

Cube root of 20.36 is ~2.72 in. That's way below the options, so perhaps 20,000 psi is too low.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the shaft is under both bending and torsion, so the equivalent stress must be considered.

Earlier, I had the equivalent stress expression as sqrt( (50,400/(π d³))² + (2,560,000/(π d³))² ) <= σ_allow.

Which simplifies to sqrt( (50,400² + 2,560,000²) ) / (π d³) ) <= σ_allow.

As before, the numerator inside the sqrt is about 2,560,500, so the expression becomes 2,560,500/(π d³) <= σ_allow.

Assuming σ_allow is, say, 40,000 psi:

2,560,500/(π d³) =40,000 → d³=2,560,500/(40,000 * π)=2,560,500/(125,663.7)=~20.36 → d≈2.72 in. But the options don't go that low except maybe option H is 3¾, but that's 3.75, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate.

Wait, the bending moment is 32,000 lb-in. So M=32,000.

The formula for bending stress is σ = (32*M)/(π d³) * K_bending.

So σ = (32 *32,000) * 2.5 / (π d³) = (1,024,000) *2.5 / (π d³) =2,560,000/(π d³).

If I set this equal to σ_allow, say 30,000 psi:

2,560,000/(π d³)=30,000 → d³=2,560,000/(30,000 * π)=2,560,000/(94,247.78)=~27.14 → d≈3 in.

But the options don't have 3 in. The closest is option D:3½ in.

Alternatively, maybe the allowable stress is lower, say 25,000 psi.

Then d³=2,560,000/(25,000 * π)=2,560,000/(78,539.82)=~32.62 → d≈3.2 in.

So about 3.2 inches. Looking at the options, option C is 3 7/8 in. (3.875), option D is 3.5 in., option H is 3.75 in.

Hmm, 3.2 is closer to 3.25, but that's not an option. The closest is 3.5 in. (option D).

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something else. Maybe the
