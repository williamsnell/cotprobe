Okay, so I've got this problem here about a store selling two items, each for $10. One item costs $5.25 and the other is $6.50. I need to find the ratio in which they should be purchased so that the average markup based on the selling price is 40%. Hmm, markup... I remember that markup is the difference between the selling price and the cost, right? So, the selling price is $10 for both items.

Wait, the question is about the average markup being 40% of the selling price. So, the average markup across both items should be 40% of $10, which is $4. Because 40% of 10 is 0.4 *10 = 4.

So, the average markup per item should be $4. Now, each item has its own markup. Let me calculate the markup for each.

The first item costs $5.25 and sells for $10. So, markup is 10 - 5.25 = $4.75.

The second item costs $6.50, so markup is 10 - 6.50 = $3.50.

Wait, but we need the average markup to be $4. So, how do we find the ratio of the quantities of these two items to achieve that average?

I think I should model this as a weighted average problem. Like, the total markup divided by the total number of items should equal $4.

Let me denote the number of the first item (cost $5.25) as x, and the second (cost $6.50) as y.

Each x contributes a markup of $4.75, and each y contributes $3.50.

So, the total markup is 4.75x + 3.50y.

The total number of items is x + y.

We want the average markup to be 4, so:

(4.75x + 3.50y) / (x + y) = 4

Multiply both sides by (x + y):

4.75x + 3.50y = 4(x + y)

Expand the right side: 4x +4y

So, 4.75x +3.5y =4x +4y

Let me subtract 4x and 3.5y from both sides:

4.75x -4x = 4y -3.5y

0.75x = 0.5y

Divide both sides by 0.5:

(0.75 / 0.5) x = y

0.75 divided by 0.5 is 1.5, so 1.5x = y

Which I can write as y = (3/2)x → y:x = 3:2

Wait, that would be the ratio of y to x. So y is 3 parts, x is 2 parts. So the ratio of item x to item y is 2:3.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes ratios can get confusing.

So, if I have y = 1.5x, then for every 2 units of x, there are 3 units of y. So x:y is 2:3.

So the ratio of the cheaper item (x, which is $5.25) to the more expensive one (y, $6.50) is 2:3. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't mix them up.

Wait, in my initial setup, x is the number of items at $5.25, y is the number at $6.50. So the ratio of x to y is 2:3. So the answer would be 2 to 3.

Looking at the options, option E is 2 to 3, which would be the correct ratio.

Wait, but let me think again. Because I had 4.75x +3.5y =4(x+y), which gave me 0.75x =0.5y → 3x=2y → y=(3/2)x → so the ratio is x:y = 2:3.

Yes, that's correct. So the store needs to purchase 2 of the cheaper item for every 3 of the more expensive one to get an average markup of 40%. 

Therefore, the correct answer is E: 2 to 3.

To determine the ratio of items at each price that must be purchased to achieve an average markup of 40% based on the selling price, we start by calculating the markup for each item:

1. The first item costs $5.25 and sells for $10, so its markup is:
   \[
   \$10 - \$5.25 = \$4.75
   \]

2. The second item costs $6.50 and sells for $10, so its markup is:
   \[
   \$10 - \$6.50 = \$3.50
   \]

The goal is to achieve an average markup of 40% of the selling price, which is:
\[
0.4 \times \$10 = \$4
\]

Let \(x\) represent the number of the first item and \(y\) represent the number of the second item. The total markup is given by:
\[
4.75x + 3.50y
\]
The total number of items is \(x + y\). The average markup is therefore:
\[
\frac{4.75x + 3.50y}{x + y} = 4
\]

Multiplying through by \(x + y\) to eliminate the denominator:
\[
4.75x + 3.50y = 4(x + y)
\]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[
4.75x + 3.50y = 4x + 4y
\]
\[
0.75x = 0.5y
\]

Dividing through by 0.5:
\[
1.5x = y
\]

This implies:
\[
y = 1.5x \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{x}{y} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

Thus, the ratio of the first item to the second item is \(2:3\). This means the store must purchase 2 of the cheaper item (costing $5.25) for every 3 of the more expensive item (costing $6.50) to achieve the desired average markup.

The correct answer is **E: 2 to 3**.
