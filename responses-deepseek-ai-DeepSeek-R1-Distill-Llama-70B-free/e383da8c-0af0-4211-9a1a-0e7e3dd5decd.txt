Question:

"The price level generally begins to rise before full employment is reached. At full employment , ad-ditional spending tends to be purely inflationary ".

Options:

A: Prices rise as economy approaches full employment because resources are not fully employed simultaneously in all industries
B: Resources are fully employed simultaneously in all industries
C: At full employment, additional spending leads to increased production rather than inflation
D: Full employment causes a decrease in overall spending and lowers inflation
E: Prices remain constant at full employment due to government intervention
F: Prices rise only after surpassing full employment due to resource scarcity
G: Prices are unaffected by employment levels and depend solely on monetary policies
H: Full employment guarantees equal distribution of resources across all industries
I: Prices drop when economy approaches full employment
J: There is no price increase when demand increases

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics question. The question is about when the price level starts to rise and what happens at full employment. Let me break it down.

The question states, "The price level generally begins to rise before full employment is reached. At full employment, additional spending tends to be purely inflationary." So, the key points here are that prices start rising before full employment, and once full employment is reached, any extra spending just causes inflation, not more production.

Now I need to look at the options and see which one aligns with this statement.

Option A says, "Prices rise as economy approaches full employment because resources are not fully employed simultaneously in all industries." Hmm, so this is suggesting that as the economy nears full employment, some resources might be used up before others, leading to price increases. That makes sense because maybe some industries hit full capacity before others, causing shortages and thus higher prices.

Option B states, "Resources are fully employed simultaneously in all industries." That doesn't seem right because full employment doesn't mean every single industry is at 100% capacity at the same time. It's more about the overall economy being near full employment, but some sectors might still have slack while others are maxed out.

Option C claims, "At full employment, additional spending leads to increased production rather than inflation." But wait, the question says the opposite. It says additional spending at full employment is purely inflationary, so this must be incorrect.

Option D, "Full employment causes a decrease in overall spending and lowers inflation." That doesn't fit because full employment usually means people have jobs and might spend more, not less. Plus, the question says more spending causes inflation, not lower.

Option E, "Prices remain constant at full employment due to government intervention." I don't think the question mentions government intervention, and generally, prices don't stay constant when spending increases beyond full employment. So probably not E.

Option F, "Prices rise only after surpassing full employment due to resource scarcity." The question says prices rise before full employment, so this is the opposite. So F is incorrect.

Option G, "Prices are unaffected by employment levels and depend solely on monetary policies." That's not right because the question clearly ties price changes to employment levels, so G is wrong.

Option H, "Full employment guarantees equal distribution of resources across all industries." That's not necessarily true. Full employment just means most people are working; it doesn't mean every industry is perfectly balanced. So H is incorrect.

Option I, "Prices drop when economy approaches full employment." No, the question says prices rise as we approach full employment, so I is wrong.

Option J, "There is no price increase when demand increases." That's definitely wrong because the question says prices do rise when demand increases, especially as the economy approaches full employment.

So going back, the correct answer should be A. It explains that as the economy approaches full employment, not all industries have their resources fully employed at the same time. So some might hit capacity sooner, causing prices to rise before the entire economy is at full employment. And once full employment is reached, any more spending can't increase production, so it just causes inflation.

The correct answer is A. This is because as the economy approaches full employment, resources are not simultaneously fully employed in all industries. Some industries may reach full capacity before others, leading to price increases. Once full employment is achieved, additional spending cannot increase production further and becomes inflationary.
