Okay, so I've got this limit problem here, and I'm supposed to find the value of c that makes the limit exist. Let me think about how to approach this.

The problem is the limit as x approaches 1 of (1/(x - 1) - c/(x³ - 1)). Hmm, right. I remember that when dealing with limits that result in indeterminate forms like 0/0, we can use L’Hospital’s Rule or try to simplify the expression by factoring.

First, maybe I should try to simplify the expression. Let me break it down. The denominators are (x - 1) and (x³ - 1). Oh wait, x³ - 1 is a difference of cubes, so it can be factored. The formula for a³ - b³ is (a - b)(a² + ab + b²), so x³ - 1 = (x - 1)(x² + x + 1). That's helpful.

So substituting that in, the expression becomes:

1/(x - 1) - c/[(x - 1)(x² + x + 1)]

I can factor out (x - 1) from both terms. Let me write it as:

[1*(x² + x + 1) - c] / [(x - 1)(x² + x + 1)]

Wait, no. Let me see. Let me get a common denominator for the two fractions. The denominators are (x-1) and (x-1)(x² + x + 1). So the common denominator is (x-1)(x² + x + 1). So I can rewrite the first term as (x² + x +1) over that denominator.

So the combined fraction is [ (x² + x +1) - c ] / [ (x - 1)(x² + x + 1) ]

So the numerator becomes (x² + x +1 - c), and the denominator is (x-1)(x² +x +1). 

Now, when x approaches 1, both the numerator and denominator approach 0 if the numerator also approaches 0. Let's check. Substitute x=1 into the numerator:

1² + 1 +1 - c = 3 - c. So for the numerator to approach 0, c must be 3. Because 3 - c =0 implies c=3.

Wait, but let me think again. If c is 3, then the numerator becomes x² + x +1 -3 = x² + x -2. Let me factor that. x² + x -2 = (x+2)(x-1). Oh wait, that's (x -1)(x + 2). So the numerator is (x -1)(x +2).

So substituting back into the fraction:

[(x -1)(x +2)] / [ (x -1)(x² +x +1) ]

We can cancel the (x -1) terms, as long as x ≠1, which is fine because we're taking the limit as x approaches 1. So after canceling, we have (x + 2)/(x² + x +1).

Now, taking the limit as x approaches 1:

(1 + 2)/(1 +1 +1) = 3/3 =1.

So the limit exists and is equal to 1.

But wait, the question only asks for the value of c. So in this case, c must be 3, which is option J.

Let me double-check. If c is not 3, what happens? Suppose c isn't 3, then the numerator as x approaches 1 would be 3 - c. So if c isn't 3, then the numerator approaches 3 - c, which isn't zero. Then the denominator approaches 0 (since x approaches 1), so the whole expression would approach either positive or negative infinity, depending on the sign. Therefore, for the limit to exist, the numerator must approach zero, so c must be 3. That makes sense.

So the correct answer is J:3.

To determine the value of \( c \) that ensures the limit 

\[
\lim_{x \to 1} \left( \frac{1}{x - 1} - \frac{c}{x^3 - 1} \right)
\]

exists, we start by simplifying the expression. First, factor \( x^3 - 1 \) as a difference of cubes:

\[
x^3 - 1 = (x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1).
\]

Substituting this into the expression, we rewrite it as:

\[
\frac{1}{x - 1} - \frac{c}{(x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1)}.
\]

Combining the two terms over a common denominator, we get:

\[
\frac{(x^2 + x + 1) - c}{(x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1)}.
\]

For the limit to exist, the numerator must approach zero as \( x \to 1 \), ensuring the expression does not lead to an indeterminate form. Substituting \( x = 1 \) into the numerator:

\[
1^2 + 1 + 1 - c = 3 - c.
\]

To make the numerator zero, we require:

\[
3 - c = 0 \implies c = 3.
\]

If \( c = 3 \), the numerator becomes \( x^2 + x - 2 \), which factors as \( (x - 1)(x + 2) \). Substituting this back into the expression:

\[
\frac{(x - 1)(x + 2)}{(x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1)}.
\]

Canceling \( (x - 1) \) from the numerator and denominator (valid since \( x \neq 1 \)), we are left with:

\[
\frac{x + 2}{x^2 + x + 1}.
\]

Taking the limit as \( x \to 1 \):

\[
\frac{1 + 2}{1^2 + 1 + 1} = \frac{3}{3} = 1.
\]

Thus, the limit exists and is finite when \( c = 3 \). If \( c \neq 3 \), the numerator does not approach zero, and the expression would diverge to infinity. Therefore, the correct value of \( c \) is:

**J: 3**
