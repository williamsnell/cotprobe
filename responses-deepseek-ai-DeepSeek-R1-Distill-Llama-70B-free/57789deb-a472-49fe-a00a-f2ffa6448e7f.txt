Okay, so I have this question about reflex arcs and the pathway of an impulse. Hmm, I remember that a reflex arc is the pathway that an impulse takes through the nervous system to produce a response. Let me try to recall the components involved.

So, reflex arcs have a few key parts. First, there's the receptor, which is like the sensor that detects the stimulus. Then, the impulse travels along the afferent neuron, which I think carries the signal towards the central nervous system. Once it's in the CNS, it might go through an interneuron, which is an intermediate neuron that processes the information. After that, the signal goes along the efferent neuron, which carries it away from the CNS to the effector. The effector is the muscle or gland that responds.

Wait, let me make sure I got the order right. So the sequence should be: receptor → afferent → interneuron → efferent → effector. Looking at the options, I need to find which option matches this order.

Let's go through each option quickly. Option A starts with interneuron, which doesn't make sense because the impulse starts at the receptor. Option B starts with effector, which is the end point, so that's wrong. Option C has sensory neuron first, but I think the correct term here is afferent neuron, not sensory. Wait, are they the same? Maybe sometimes it's called sensory. Hmm, but the standard terms I remember are afferent and efferent.

Option D: sensory, afferent, interneuron, efferent, receptor? No, that ends with receptor, which is the start. So that's mixed up. Option E starts with receptor, but then goes efferent, which is wrong because after receptor comes afferent. So E is incorrect. Option F starts with efferent, which is wrong.

Option G: receptor, afferent, efferent, interneuron, effector. Wait, that would mean afferent goes to efferent without the interneuron in the middle? Or maybe I got the order wrong. Oh wait, no, the correct order after afferent is interneuron, then efferent. So G has afferent then efferent, skipping interneuron, which is wrong.

Option H: receptor, efferent, afferent... No, that's mixing it up. I is afferent first, which isn't right. J is receptor, afferent, interneuron, efferent, effector. That looks exactly like the order I was thinking! So J must be the correct answer.

The correct sequence of a reflex arc is: receptor → afferent neuron → interneuron → efferent neuron → effector. This order ensures the impulse travels from the receptor through the nervous system and results in a response from the effector. Among the options provided, only option J matches this sequence.

Answer: J
