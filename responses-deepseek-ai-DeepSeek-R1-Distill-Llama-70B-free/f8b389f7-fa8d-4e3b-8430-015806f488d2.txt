Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the minimum photon energy required to create a real electron-positron pair. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, I remember that electron-positron pair production is a process where a photon creates an electron and a positron. But for that to happen, the photon must have enough energy. And I think the minimum energy is when the photon's energy is just enough to create the rest mass of the two particles, right?

Each electron has a rest mass energy, which is like the energy equivalent of their mass. Oh right, Einstein's E=mc². So for an electron, the rest energy is about 0.511 MeV. But wait, since we're creating both an electron and a positron, we need to double that. So 0.511 times 2 equals 1.022 MeV. That makes sense because they have the same mass but opposite charges.

Wait, MeV is mega-electron volts, so 1 MeV is 1e6 eV. So 1.022 MeV is 1.022e6 eV. Looking at the options, option J is 1.022 ×10^6 eV. That seems to fit.

But wait, let me make sure. I've heard that sometimes pair production needs the energy to be a bit higher because of conservation of momentum. Oh right, in the center-of-mass frame, the photon's energy must be at least twice the rest mass energy. Because if the photon has just the right energy, it's when it's at rest, but photons can't be at rest. So maybe the minimum is actually when the photon's energy is equal to twice the rest energy, but that might be when it's in a specific frame. Or perhaps for the photon's energy in the lab frame, you need to consider the threshold.

Wait no, the minimum energy for pair production is when the photon's energy is exactly twice the electron's rest energy, but only when it's in a frame where the photon is at rest. Oh wait, photons can't be at rest because they always move at the speed of light. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, I remember that pair production requires the photon to have energy at least equal to the combined rest mass energy of the electron and positron. Which is 2 * 0.511 MeV, so 1.022 MeV. So that's 1.022e6 eV.

Looking back at the options, option J is exactly that. So the correct answer must be J.

Wait, just to make sure I'm not missing anything. The question is about the minimum photon energy. So it's when the kinetic energy is zero, meaning all the energy goes into the rest mass. So yes, the minimum is 1.022 MeV, which is 1.022e6 eV. So the correct choice is J.

To calculate the minimum photon energy required to create a real electron-positron pair, we need to consider the rest mass energy of the particles. Each electron and positron has a rest energy of approximately 0.511 MeV (million electron volts). Since an electron-positron pair consists of both particles, the total minimum energy required is the sum of their rest energies:

\[
E_{\text{minimum}} = 2 \times 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 1.022 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Converting this to electron volts:

\[
1 \, \text{MeV} = 10^6 \, \text{eV}, \quad \text{so} \quad 1.022 \, \text{MeV} = 1.022 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV}.
\]

Among the given options, the one that matches this value is **J: 1.022 × 10⁶ eV**. This represents the minimum photon energy required for the process of pair production, where the photon's energy is entirely converted into the rest mass energy of the electron and positron.

Answer: J
