Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's asking. The question is about calculating the change in Gibbs free energy at a different temperature using the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation. 

The reaction given is 2 CO(g) + O2(g) → 2 CO2(g). They're asking for ΔrG° at 375 K, and they provide ΔrG° and ΔrH° at 298 K, but wait, the question doesn't give specific numbers, so I must assume that I'm supposed to remember some standard values or perhaps the question is part of a set where these values were given earlier. Hmm, but since the options are given, maybe I can work through it with variables.

Wait, I remember the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation relates the change in Gibbs free energy at two different temperatures. The equation is ΔG2 = ΔH - TΔS, but wait, I think it's more precise. Oh right, the formula is ΔG2 = ΔH - T2ΔS, where ΔS is the entropy change at temperature T1, but wait, no, because entropy can vary with temperature. But perhaps in this problem, it's assumed that ΔH and ΔS are temperature-independent, which is an approximation.

So the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation is often written as ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. But wait, that's at the same temperature as the ΔH and ΔS. Oh, but when the temperature changes, we can use the relation assuming ΔH and ΔS are constant over the temperature range. So the equation would be ΔG(T2) = ΔH - T2 * ΔS.

Wait, but we need to calculate ΔG at 375 K, and we have ΔG at 298 K. Let me think. Alternatively, another approach is to use the van 't Hoff equation, but that relates to the equilibrium constant. Maybe I should stick to the Gibbs-Helmholtz approach here.

Wait, the standard Gibbs free energy change at T1 (298 K) is given as ΔG1°. We need to find ΔG2° at T2 (375 K). So the equation would be:

ΔG2° = ΔH° - T2 * ΔS°, but wait, no, because ΔH° is the enthalpy change at T1. So maybe I should use the relation between the two temperatures.

Alternatively, since ΔG° at T is given by ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°, but wait, that's only correct when ΔH° and ΔS° are taken at the same temperature as T. Since we're moving from T1 to T2, perhaps it's better to calculate ΔS° first using T1, then use it in the equation for T2.

So, let's break it down. At 298 K, ΔG1° = ΔH° - T1 * ΔS°. We can solve for ΔS°: ΔS° = (ΔH° - ΔG1°) / T1.

Once I have ΔS°, I can plug it into the equation for T2: ΔG2° = ΔH° - T2 * ΔS°.

Wait, but wait, are ΔH° and ΔS° temperature-dependent? In reality, yes, but for small temperature changes, we often assume they are constant. So this approach should be acceptable.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Use ΔG1° = ΔH° - T1 * ΔS° to find ΔS°.
2. Then, use ΔG2° = ΔH° - T2 * ΔS°.

But wait, do I have values for ΔG1° and ΔH°? The problem states that they are given, but since I don't have the exact numbers, maybe the problem expects me to proceed as if I have them. Alternatively, perhaps it's a standard reaction where I can look up these values, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ΔS° from the given data.

Wait, perhaps I can think of this in terms of the Gibbs equation. Let me write down the variables:

Given:
T1 = 298 K
T2 = 375 K
ΔG1° = ? (But the problem must have provided it, perhaps earlier in a table or something. Since I don't have that, maybe I should think of it in terms of an example.)

Wait, perhaps the problem is part of a set where the values are given elsewhere. Since I don't have that, perhaps I should proceed with sample numbers, but I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it as a hypothetical scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate using the relation between ΔG at two temperatures. Let me try that.

Suppose ΔG1° at T1 is known, say, for the reaction. Let's say, for example, that at 298 K, ΔG1° is X kJ/mol, and ΔH° is Y kJ/mol. Then ΔS° would be (Y - X)/T1.

Then, at T2, ΔG2° = Y - T2*(Y - X)/T1.

But without the actual numbers, it's hard to proceed. Wait, perhaps the options can give me a clue. Let me look at the options. The options are:

A: -560
B: -525
C: -475
D: -501
E: -600
F: -650
G: -700
H: -550
I: -450
J: -550.5

These are all in the -450 to -700 range. So, the reaction is spontaneous at both temperatures, as the ΔG is negative.

Wait, I remember that the standard Gibbs free energy of formation for CO2 is about -394.4 kJ/mol. For CO, it's -110.5 kJ/mol, and O2 is zero. So let's calculate ΔG° at 298 K.

ΔrG°(298) = [2 * (-394.4)] - [2*(-110.5) + 0].

So that's 2*(-394.4) = -788.8, and 2*(-110.5) = -221. So ΔrG = -788.8 - (-221) = -567.8 kJ/mol.

But wait, that's a rough calculation. Let me do it more accurately. So 2* (-394.4) is -788.8, and for the reactants, 2*(-110.5) is -221. So ΔrG = (-788.8) - (-221) = -788.8 + 221 = -567.8 kJ/mol. So approximately -568 kJ/mol. Hmm, but let's see the given data. Wait, perhaps the problem states that at 298 K, the ΔrG is -567 kJ/mol, and ΔrH is, say, something else.

Alternatively, if I can't get the exact numbers, perhaps I should proceed with the formula.

Wait, perhaps the problem gives ΔrG°(298) as -560 kJ/mol. Let me check the options. Option A is -560, so perhaps that's the value at 298 K. But the problem says that's the value to use.

Wait, but the question isn't clear whether the given ΔrG° and ΔrH° are for the reaction. Let me re-read the question.

The question says: Calculate ΔrG°(375 K) for the reaction from the values of ΔrG°(298 K) and ΔrH°(298 K), and the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation.

So, okay, I have ΔrG1° (at 298 K) and ΔrH° (at 298 K). So I can calculate ΔS° using ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. Then use that ΔS° to find ΔG at 375 K.

So, let's write the steps.

Step 1: Calculate ΔS° at 298 K.

ΔG1° = ΔH° - T1 * ΔS° → ΔS° = (ΔH° - ΔG1°) / T1.

Step 2: Use ΔS° to find ΔG2° at T2.

ΔG2° = ΔH° - T2 * ΔS°.

But wait, in the formula, ΔS is the entropy change of the reaction, which is ΔS° = S°(products) - S°(reactants).

But in terms of the reaction, that's correct.

So, let's plug in the numbers. But I need the values. Hmm, perhaps I should assume that the given ΔrG°(298 K) is, say, -560 kJ/mol, as in option A. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use a specific approach without needing the exact numbers.

Wait, perhaps the problem provides specific values, but since I don't have them, I'm stuck. Alternatively, maybe I can make up numbers for the sake of calculation, but that's not helpful.

Wait a minute, perhaps I can find the standard values. Let me think: For the reaction 2 CO(g) + O2(g) → 2 CO2(g), the standard ΔH° is about -566.8 kJ/mol (I recall that the enthalpy of formation of CO2 is about -393.5 kJ/mol, CO is about -110.5 kJ/mol, so the reaction's ΔH° is 2*(-393.5) - [2*(-110.5) + 0] = -787 + 221 = -566 kJ/mol. Similarly, the standard ΔG° is about -567.8 kJ/mol as I calculated earlier.

But okay, let's take ΔrG°(298) as approximately -567.8 kJ/mol, and ΔrH° as -566.8 kJ/mol. Then, using these, I can compute ΔS°.

So,

ΔS° = (ΔH° - ΔG°) / T.

Plugging in the numbers:

ΔH° = -566800 J/mol (since I'm converting kJ to J for the temperature in K).
ΔG° = -567800 J/mol.
T = 298 K.

So ΔS° = (-566800 - (-567800)) / 298 = (1000) / 298 ≈ 3.356 J/(mol·K).

Hmm, that's a small positive entropy change. Let me check the units. Yes, I converted kJ to J correctly. So, 1000 J / 298 K ≈ 3.356 J/(mol·K).

Now, to find ΔG2° at T2 = 375 K.

ΔG2° = ΔH° - T2 * ΔS°.

Plugging the numbers:

ΔH° = -566800 J/mol.
T2 = 375 K.
ΔS° = 3.356 J/(mol·K).

So,

ΔG2° = (-566800) - (375 * 3.356).

Calculate 375 * 3.356:

3.356 * 375 = let's compute. 3 * 375 = 1125, 0.356 * 375 = 133.5, so total is 1125 + 133.5 = 1258.5 J/mol.

So,

ΔG2° = (-566800 J) - (1258.5 J) = -568058.5 J ≈ -568,059 J ≈ -568.059 kJ/mol.

Wait, that's approximately -568 kJ/mol. But wait, that's very close to the ΔG at 298 K. So, because the entropy change is small, the Gibbs free energy doesn't change much with temperature.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A: -560, but that's higher than -568. Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the numbers because I assumed specific values.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact approach without plugging in numbers. Let's try that.

We have:

ΔG2° = ΔH° - T2 * [(ΔH° - ΔG1°)/T1].

So,

ΔG2° = ΔH° - (T2/T1) * (ΔH° - ΔG1°).

Factor ΔH°:

ΔG2° = ΔH° [1 - (T2/T1)] + ΔG1° * (T2/T1).

Alternatively,

ΔG2° = ΔG1° + (ΔH° - ΔG1°) * (T2/T1).

Wait, perhaps that's an alternative way to write it. Let me verify.

Starting from ΔG1° = ΔH° - T1 * ΔS°, so ΔS° = (ΔH° - ΔG1°)/T1.

Then, ΔG2° = ΔH° - T2 * ΔS° = ΔH° - T2*(ΔH° - ΔG1°)/T1.

Expanding:

ΔG2° = ΔH° - [T2*(ΔH°) - T2*(ΔG1°)] / T1.

= [ΔH° * T1 - T2 ΔH° + T2 ΔG1° ] / T1.

= [ΔH° (T1 - T2) + T2 ΔG1° ] / T1.

Hmm, or perhaps I can factor it differently.

Alternatively, let's write it as:

ΔG2° = (ΔH°)(1 - T2/T1) + (ΔG1°)(T2/T1).

So, using this formula, I can plug in the values.

But without the actual numbers for ΔG1° and ΔH°, it's tricky. So perhaps the problem expects me to use the given values, but since I don't have them, I can't proceed numerically.

Wait, let me think again. The problem says "from the values of ΔrG°(298 K) and ΔrH°(298 K)", which implies that I must have those values. But since I'm a student, perhaps in the actual exam, those values would be provided, perhaps in a table or earlier in the problem set.

Wait, maybe I can make up numbers based on standard values. Let's proceed with that.

Assume that for the reaction at 298 K:

ΔrG°(298) = -560 kJ/mol (option A is -560, perhaps that's the given value at 298 K).

ΔrH°(298) = -560 kJ/mol as well? Or maybe different. Wait, earlier when I calculated ΔH°, I got about -566.8 kJ/mol. So perhaps the problem uses ΔrH° = -560 kJ/mol and ΔrG° = -560 kJ/mol, but that can't be because then the entropy change would be zero.

Wait, no, if ΔG = ΔH - TΔS, then if ΔG = ΔH, then ΔS would be zero. So, perhaps in the problem, ΔrG° and ΔrH° are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the given ΔrG°(298) is -560 kJ/mol, and ΔrH°(298) is some other value.

Wait, perhaps it's better to proceed with the formula and see what the options are. Let me consider that:

Given ΔG1 = -560 kJ/mol, T1 = 298 K, T2 = 375 K, and ΔH = ?

Wait, but without knowing ΔH, I can't proceed. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express ΔG2 in terms of ΔG1 and ΔH.

Wait, another approach: the change in Gibbs free energy with temperature is given by the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation, which can be written as:

dG = -S dT.

But that's in terms of dG, so integrating from T1 to T2:

ΔG2 = ΔG1 - ∫(from T1 to T2) S dT.

But if S is assumed constant, then ΔG2 = ΔG1 - S*(T2 - T1).

But S is calculated from ΔG1 = ΔH - T1 S → S = (ΔH - ΔG1)/T1.

So substituting, ΔG2 = ΔG1 - [(ΔH - ΔG1)/T1] * (T2 - T1).

Hmm, perhaps that's the way to proceed.

Expanding this:

ΔG2 = ΔG1 - (ΔH - ΔG1)(T2 - T1)/T1.

= ΔG1 - (ΔH (T2 - T1) - ΔG1 (T2 - T1))/T1.

= [ΔG1 T1 - ΔH (T2 - T1) + ΔG1 (T2 - T1)] / T1.

Hmm, perhaps this can be simplified.

Alternatively, let me factor it:

ΔG2 = [ΔG1 (T1 + T2 - T1) ) - ΔH (T2 - T1) ] / T1.

Wait, maybe that's not the right way. Alternatively, perhaps I can plug in the numbers.

Let me assume that ΔG1 is -560 kJ/mol (option A), and ΔH is, say, -550 kJ/mol. But I'm just making up these numbers; I don't know the actual values.

Wait, perhaps the problem provides that ΔrG°(298) is -560 kJ/mol and ΔrH°(298) is -501 kJ/mol, which is option D. Wait, that's a possible scenario.

Wait, but without the exact numbers, I can't proceed accurately. So perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, another approach: the reaction is 2CO + O2 → 2CO2.

The Gibbs free energy change can be calculated using the standard Gibbs of formation. At 298 K, I can calculate ΔrG°, which I did earlier as approximately -568 kJ/mol.

But if the problem states that at 298 K, ΔrG° is, say, -560 kJ/mol, and ΔrH° is, perhaps, -525 kJ/mol (option B), then I can compute ΔS°.

Wait, let's try with hypothetical numbers.

Suppose:

ΔG1° = -560 kJ/mol (298 K)
ΔH° = -525 kJ/mol (298 K)

Then, ΔS° = (ΔH - ΔG1) / T1.

Wait, but wait, ΔG = ΔH - TΔS → ΔS = (ΔH - ΔG)/T.

So, plugging in:

ΔS° = ( (-525,000 J) - (-560,000 J) ) / 298 K.

= (35,000 J) / 298 K ≈ 117.45 J/(mol·K).

Then, at T2 = 375 K,

ΔG2° = ΔH° - T2 * Δ
