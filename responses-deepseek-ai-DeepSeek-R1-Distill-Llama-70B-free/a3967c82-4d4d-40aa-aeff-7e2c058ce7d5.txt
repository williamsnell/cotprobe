Question:

Why are the elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen (C, H, O, N) of immense importance in living matter ?

Options:

A: These elements make up the majority of non-living matter.
B: Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen are the four most abundant elements in living organisms, make up about 99 percent of the mass of most cells, and can readily form covalent bonds by electron pair sharing.
C: These elements are rare and precious.
D: They are noble gases that are crucial for maintaining the structure of proteins.
E: These elements are responsible for the magnetic properties of living organisms.
F: These elements are heavy metals that are essential for building DNA and RNA structures.
G: These elements cannot form covalent bonds.
H: Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen are the only elements that organisms need for survival.
I: These elements are only important for their radioactive properties.
J: Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen are the only elements that can form ionic bonds.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out why the elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen are so important in living matter. The question gives me multiple choices, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember from my biology classes that these four elements are the building blocks of life. They're found in all living organisms in significant amounts. So, I'm guessing the answer has something to do with their abundance and how they form the structures necessary for life.

Looking at the options:

Option A says they make up most of non-living matter. Well, non-living matter's composition is different. For example, the Earth's crust has a lot of oxygen, silicon, etc., but I think in living organisms, these four are dominant. So A might not be the right reason.

Option B states that these four are the most abundant in living organisms, make up about 99% of the mass of most cells, and can form covalent bonds. That rings a bell. I remember that carbon is especially good at forming long chains and rings because of its ability to bond with itself and other elements, especially through covalent bonds. Hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen also participate in these bonds, forming molecules like water, carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids. So B seems like a strong candidate.

Option C claims they're rare and precious. That doesn't make sense because if they were rare, they wouldn't be so abundant in living things. So C is probably wrong.

Option D says they're noble gases crucial for proteins. Wait, noble gases like helium and neon are inert and don't typically form compounds. But C, H, O, N are not noble gases. So D must be incorrect.

Option E suggests they're responsible for magnetic properties. I don't recall biology emphasizing magnetic properties as a key factor in life processes. So E is likely not the answer.

Option F states they're heavy metals essential for DNA and RNA. Heavy metals are typically metals with high atomic weights, like mercury or lead. But C, H, O, N are not heavy metals. Plus, while they are part of DNA and RNA, calling them heavy metals is incorrect. So F isn't right.

Option G says they can't form covalent bonds. But I know that's wrong because these elements do form covalent bonds extensively in biomolecules. So G is incorrect.

Option H claims they're the only elements needed for survival. That's not true because other elements like phosphorus, sulfur, potassium, etc., are also essential in smaller amounts. So H is wrong.

Option I talks about radioactive properties. None of these elements are radioactive in their common isotopes, so I is incorrect.

Option J says they're the only ones that form ionic bonds. That's not right because while they can form ionic bonds (like Na+ with Cl-), many other elements can as well. Plus, in biological molecules, covalent bonds are more prevalent. So J isn't the answer.

Putting it all together, the most accurate answer is B. It correctly states that these elements are abundant, make up most of the cell's mass, and can form covalent bonds, which is crucial for the molecules of life.

The elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen (C, H, O, N) are of immense importance in living matter because they are the most abundant elements in living organisms, comprising about 99% of the mass of most cells. These elements are crucial for forming the molecules essential for life, such as water, carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids. Their ability to readily form covalent bonds through electron pair sharing allows for the creation of complex structures necessary for biological functions. 

Among the options provided:

- **A** is incorrect because these elements are primarily significant in living matter, not non-living matter.
- **B** is correct as it accurately describes their abundance, their contribution to cellular mass, and their role in forming covalent bonds.
- **C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J** are all incorrect for various reasons, such as misrepresenting their properties or biological roles.

Thus, the correct answer is:

B

Answer: B
