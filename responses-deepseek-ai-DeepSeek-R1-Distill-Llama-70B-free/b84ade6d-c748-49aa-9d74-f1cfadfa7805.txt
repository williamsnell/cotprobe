Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about identifying which compounds don't contain a covalent bond. The options given are KCl, PH3, GeCl4, H2S, and CsF. The possible answers are combinations of these compounds. 

Hmm, I remember that covalent bonds are between nonmetals, right? And ionic bonds are between metals and nonmetals. So the key here is to figure out which of these compounds are ionic, meaning they don't have covalent bonds. Because if a compound is ionic, it doesn't contain covalent bonds, right?

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. KCl: K is potassium, a metal, and Cl is chlorine, a nonmetal. So KCl is an ionic compound because it's between a metal and a nonmetal. Therefore, it doesn't have covalent bonds.

2. PH3: P is phosphorus, a nonmetal, and H is hydrogen, also a nonmetal. So PH3 is a covalent compound. So it does have covalent bonds.

3. GeCl4: Ge is germanium. I'm a bit fuzzy on whether germanium is a metal or nonmetal. Wait, germanium is a metalloid, right? But for bonding purposes, when it forms compounds with nonmetals, it usually forms covalent bonds. Cl is a nonmetal. So GeCl4 would be covalent, I think. So it has covalent bonds.

4. H2S: H is hydrogen (nonmetal), S is sulfur (nonmetal). So H2S is a covalent compound. Covalent bonds here.

5. CsF: Cs is cesium, a metal, and F is fluorine, a nonmetal. So CsF is ionic. No covalent bonds here.

So the compounds without covalent bonds are KCl and CsF because they're ionic. Which means the question is asking which compounds do not contain a covalent bond. So we need to pick the pair that includes KCl and CsF.

Looking at the options:

Option G is KCl and CsF. That must be the correct answer because both are ionic, hence no covalent bonds.

Wait, wait a second. Let me double-check the options. The question says which compounds do NOT contain a covalent bond. So the correct answer should be the pair of ionic compounds.

Looking at the options again:

- Option G: KCl, CsF. Both ionic. So they don't have covalent bonds. So they are the compounds that don't contain a covalent bond.

Other options: 

Option A: CsF and PH3. CsF is ionic, PH3 is covalent. So PH3 does contain covalent bonds, so this pair includes one that does and one that doesn't, so it's not the correct answer.

Option D: KCl and GeCl4. KCl is ionic, GeCl4 is covalent. So only KCl doesn't have covalent bonds. So this pair isn't correct.

Option F: GeCl4 and KCl. Same as D; only KCl is ionic.

Option G is the correct one.

To determine which compounds do not contain a covalent bond, we analyze the bonding nature of each compound:

1. **KCl**: Potassium (K) is a metal, and chlorine (Cl) is a nonmetal. This is an ionic compound, so it does not contain covalent bonds.  
2. **PH₃**: Phosphorus (P) and hydrogen (H) are both nonmetals. This is a covalent compound, so it contains covalent bonds.  
3. **GeCl₄**: Germanium (Ge) is a metalloid, and chlorine (Cl) is a nonmetal. This is a covalent compound, so it contains covalent bonds.  
4. **H₂S**: Hydrogen (H) and sulfur (S) are both nonmetals. This is a covalent compound, so it contains covalent bonds.  
5. **CsF**: Cesium (Cs) is a metal, and fluorine (F) is a nonmetal. This is an ionic compound, so it does not contain covalent bonds.  

The compounds that do not contain covalent bonds are **KCl** and **CsF**, as both are ionic. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**G: KCl, CsF**

Answer: G
