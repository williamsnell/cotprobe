Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the expected rate of return for a stock. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, I remember something about the CAPM model from my finance class. Oh right, CAPM stands for Capital Asset Pricing Model. It's used to determine the expected return on an investment based on its risk and the cost of capital.

The question gives me a few key pieces of information. The stock is listed on the London Stock Exchange and operates in Europe. But I'm not sure if the location affects the calculation directly. The main points are probably the UK 10-year treasury yield, the stock's historical earnings, and its Beta.

Wait, the yield on the UK 10-year treasury is 2.8%. I think that's the risk-free rate (Rf) in the CAPM formula. The Beta (β) is 1.4, which means the stock is more volatile than the market. The market return part is where I might get stuck. The question says the stock earned 8.6% historically, but I'm not sure if that's the market return or the stock's actual return.

Oh wait, the CAPM formula is: Expected return = Rf + β*(Market return - Rf). So I need to know the market return. But the question doesn't directly give me that. It only gives the stock's historical return. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the market return is the same as the stock's historical return, but that doesn't make sense because Beta is relative to the market.

Wait, maybe the 8.6% isn't the market return. Oh, perhaps the question is implying that the market's expected return is 8.6%? Or is that the stock's average return? I'm a bit confused here. Let me reread the question.

The question states that the stock will earn 8.6% as per historical data. So that's the stock's return, not the market. But to use CAPM, I need the expected market return. Oh wait, maybe the question assumes that the market return is the same as the risk-free rate plus some equity premium, but I don't have that information. Hmm, this is tricky.

Wait, perhaps the 8.6% is the market return. But that doesn't align with Beta. Let me think. If the market return is, say, Rm, then the formula is E(R) = Rf + β(Rm - Rf). If the market return is higher than Rf, which it usually is.

Wait, the problem doesn't give the market return. Oh wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The question might be using the historical return of the stock as the expected return. But that doesn't fit with the CAPM approach. Alternatively, perhaps the 8.6% is the expected market return. Or maybe it's a different approach altogether.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me clarify the data given:

- Risk-free rate (Rf) = 2.8% (from the 10-year UK treasury)
- Stock's Beta (β) = 1.4
- The stock's historical return is 8.6%, but that's probably its actual past performance, not the expected return we're calculating.

Wait, but the question is asking for the expected rate of return. So I need to use CAPM. Therefore, I need the expected market return. But the question doesn't provide the market's expected return. Hmm, that's a problem. Unless there's an assumption here that the market return is the same as the risk-free rate, which doesn't make sense because the market is riskier than the risk-free asset.

Wait, maybe the question is actually using the stock's historical return as the market return. That can't be right because the market's return is broader. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to assume that the market return is the same as the risk-free rate, but that's unlikely because beta would then not make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me think again. The question gives the stock's historical return as 8.6%, but the CAPM model uses the expected return, which is calculated from Rf, Beta, and the market return. So without the market return, I can't compute it. That suggests that perhaps the question is using the historical return as the market return. But that's not standard.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the question is using the historical return of the stock as the expected return. But that wouldn't involve Beta or the risk-free rate. So that can't be it.

Wait, perhaps the question is a trick. Let me reread it: It says the stock has earned 8.6% as per historical data. But the question is asking for the expected rate of return, which would be based on CAPM. So I need the CAPM formula.

So, if I have Rf = 2.8%, Beta = 1.4, but I don't have Rm. Hmm, unless the question is implying that the market return is 8.6%, which would make the calculation:

E(R) = 2.8% + 1.4*(8.6% - 2.8%) 

Let me compute that. 8.6% minus 2.8% is 5.8%. Multiply by 1.4 gives 8.12%. Add 2.8% gives 10.92%. So that would make the expected return 10.92%, which is option D.

Wait, but why would the market return be 8.6%? Because the question says the stock earned 8.6%, not the market. So perhaps I'm making a wrong assumption here. Alternatively, maybe the question is using the 8.6% as the market return, but that's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the stock's historical return as the expected return, but that would ignore the Beta and Rf, which doesn't make sense because the question provides them.

Wait, maybe the question is using the CAPM model but using the stock's past return as the expected return. But that's not how CAPM works. CAPM calculates the expected return based on systematic risk.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a bit ambiguous, but I think the intended approach is to use CAPM with the given data. So perhaps the 8.6% is the market's return. If that's the case, then the calculation is as before, giving 10.92%, which is option D.

But I'm not entirely confident because the question states that the stock's return is 8.6%, not the market's. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, maybe the 8.6% is the expected return, making option H correct. But that doesn't use the CAPM inputs.

Wait, going back, the question asks: What is the expected rate of return? So using CAPM would be the way to go, which requires Rf, Beta, and Rm.

But without Rm, I can't compute it. Unless the question provides Rm in another way. Wait, maybe the 8.6% is Rm. Because the stock is listed on the London exchange and operates in Europe, perhaps the market return is the 8.6% from the stock's historical data. That could be a stretch, but maybe that's what is intended.

Alternatively, perhaps the 8.6% is the average market return for the European market, but the question doesn't state that. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: If the market return is equal to the risk-free rate, which would be a very odd scenario, then Beta wouldn't matter, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is actually using the Gordon Growth Model, but that requires dividend growth rate, which isn't given.

No, I think the intended approach is CAPM. So going back, if I take Rm as 8.6%, then:

E(R) = Rf + Beta*(Rm - Rf) = 2.8 + 1.4*(8.6 - 2.8) = 2.8 + 1.4*5.8 = 2.8 + 8.12 = 10.92%.

So the expected return would be 10.92%, which is option D.

Alternatively, if the market return isn't given, perhaps the question assumes that the expected market return is equal to the risk-free rate, but that would make the market return 2.8%, which is lower than the risk-free rate, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, no. The market return is typically higher than the risk-free rate because it includes a risk premium. So if the market return is 8.6%, then the calculation works. But the question says the stock's return is 8.6%, not the market.

I'm a bit stuck here. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the required rate of return, which would be using CAPM, but without the market return, I can't compute it.

Wait, perhaps the question is missing some data, but assuming that the market return is the same as the stock's historical return, which is 8.6%, then the calculation gives option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the 8.6% is the expected return, making option H correct, but that would ignore the Beta and Rf, which are given for a reason.

Wait, another thought: The 8.6% could be the required rate of return, but that's what we're trying to find. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the Dividend Discount Model, but without dividend information, that's not possible.

I think I have to proceed under the assumption that the market return Rm is 8.6%, which is the same as the stock's historical return. So using that:

E(R) = 2.8 + 1.4*(8.6 - 2.8) = 2.8 + 1.4*5.8.

Calculating that: 1.4 *5.8 = 8.12. So 2.8 +8.12=10.92%. So the answer is D.

Alternatively, if the market return is not given, perhaps the expected return is simply the historical return, which would be 8.6%, making option H correct. But that seems to ignore the CAPM inputs, which are provided.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the historical return, but the question says "expected rate of return", which implies it's using CAPM.

In that case, without Rm, I can't compute it. But since the options include 10.92%, which is the result when Rm is 8.6%, perhaps that's the intended approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the market return is the risk-free rate. No, that can't be because the market's return is higher.

Wait, if the market return is 8.6%, then the calculation is correct. So I think the answer is D: 10.92%.

To calculate the expected rate of return for the stock, the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is used. The CAPM formula is:

\[
E(R) = R_f + \beta \cdot (R_m - R_f)
\]

Where:
- \( R_f \) is the risk-free rate (given as 2.8%, the yield on a UK 10-year treasury).
- \( \beta \) is the stock's Beta (given as 1.4).
- \( R_m \) is the expected market return.

The question does not explicitly provide the market return (\( R_m \)), but it states that the stock has historically earned 8.6%. Assuming this historical return represents the market return (\( R_m \)), the calculation proceeds as follows:

1. Subtract the risk-free rate from the market return:
   \[
   R_m - R_f = 8.6\% - 2.8\% = 5.8\%
   \]

2. Multiply this result by the stock's Beta:
   \[
   \beta \cdot (R_m - R_f) = 1.4 \cdot 5.8\% = 8.12\%
   \]

3. Add the risk-free rate to this result to find the expected rate of return:
   \[
   E(R) = 2.8\% + 8.12\% = 10.92\%
   \]

Thus, the expected rate of return for the stock is **10.92%**, which corresponds to option **D**.
