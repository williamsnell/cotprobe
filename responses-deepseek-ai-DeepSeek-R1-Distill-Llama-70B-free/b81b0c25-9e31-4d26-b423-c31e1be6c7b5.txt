Okay, let me try to figure out this dividend problem. So, the question is about calculating Mr. Schwartz's total dividend from the Neighborhood Cooperative Market. Hmm, dividends can be a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step.

First, I remember that dividends are usually calculated based on two things: investment and patronage. Oh right, in this case, there are two different dividend rates: 6% on investment and 4.5% on patronage. So I need to calculate both and add them together for the total.

Let me start with the investment part. The question says Mr. Schwartz owns 5 shares, each with a par value of $50. Par value is the face value of each share, right? So each share is worth $50, and he has 5 of them. To find the total investment, I multiply the number of shares by the par value per share. That would be 5 * $50 = $250. Got that.

Now, the dividend on investment is 6%. So I need to calculate 6% of $250. To find that, I multiply 250 by 0.06. Let me do the math: 250 * 0.06 = 15. So the dividend from investment is $15.

Next up is the patronage dividend. The rate here is 4 and a half percent, which is 4.5%. The receipts for the year are $983. I think receipts mean the amount he spent as a patron of the cooperative, so that's the basis for the patronage dividend. So I need to calculate 4.5% of $983.

Calculating that: 983 * 0.045. Let me break it down. 983 * 0.04 is 39.32, and 983 * 0.005 is 4.915. Adding those together: 39.32 + 4.915 = 44.235. Hmm, but let me double-check that multiplication. Alternatively, I can compute it as 983 * 4.5% directly. Either way, 4.5% of 983 is approximately $44.235. Maybe I should round it to two decimal places since we're dealing with dollars and cents. So that would be $44.24.

Wait, but let me make sure I did that correctly. Let me compute 983 * 0.045. 983 * 45 is ... wait, no, 0.045 is 45/1000. So 983 * 45 = let's see, 983 * 40 is 39,320 plus 983*5 which is 4,915. So 39,320 + 4,915 = 44,235. Then divide by 1000, so 44.235. Yep, so $44.24 when rounded.

So now I have both dividends: $15 from investment and $44.24 from patronage. Adding them together gives the total dividend. 15 + 44.24 = 59.24. So that's $59.24 in total.

Looking at the options, option G is $59.24. So the correct answer should be G.

Wait, let me just make sure I didn't mix up the two. Investment is 6% of $250 which is correct, and patronage is 4.5% of $983. Yep, that's right. So adding those gives $59.24. Yep, that's option G.

The total dividend is calculated by summing the dividends from investment and patronage. 

1. **Investment Dividend**:  
   Mr. Schwartz owns 5 shares with a par value of $50 each, so the total investment is:  
   \( 5 \times 50 = 250 \).  
   The dividend rate on investment is 6%, so:  
   \( 250 \times 0.06 = 15 \).  

2. **Patronage Dividend**:  
   The patronage dividend rate is 4.5%, and the receipts for the year are $983.  
   The patronage dividend is:  
   \( 983 \times 0.045 = 44.235 \), which rounds to \( 44.24 \).  

3. **Total Dividend**:  
   Adding the two dividends together:  
   \( 15 + 44.24 = 59.24 \).  

Thus, the total dividend is **$59.24**, which corresponds to option **G**.
