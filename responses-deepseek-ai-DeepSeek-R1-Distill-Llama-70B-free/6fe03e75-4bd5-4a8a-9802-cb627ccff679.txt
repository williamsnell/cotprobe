Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this psychology question about the Big Five personality traits and hypnotizability. The question is asking which dimension people who are easily hypnotized would score high on. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the Big Five personality traits are Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. Wait, but the options include some other terms like assertiveness and self-efficacy, so I need to make sure I'm matching the right terms.

Hypnotizability... I think it's related to how open someone is to experiences. People who are more open to experiences might be more imaginative and receptive to suggestions. So, the Openness dimension comes to mind. Openness includes traits like being imaginative, open to ideas, and having a rich inner life. That makes sense because hypnosis often involves visualizing scenarios and being receptive to the hypnotist's suggestions.

Looking at the options, E is Openness. But wait, I should check the other options to make sure. Let's go through each one.

A: Agreeableness. That's about being cooperative and compassionate. I don't see a direct link to hypnotizability. Maybe agreeable people are more willing, but I'm not sure if that's the main factor.

B: Emotional stability. This is the opposite of neuroticism. Emotionally stable people handle stress better. Hypnotizable people might need to be calm, but I don't think this is the key trait.

C: Assertiveness. This is part of Extraversion, I think. Assertive people are outgoing and confident. But being easily hypnotized might require the opposite, like being more submissive or open to direction. So maybe not this one.

D: Neuroticism. This is about being sensitive to stress and experiencing negative emotions. I don't think neuroticism is directly related to being hypnotized easily. Maybe high neuroticism could make someone more anxious, which might interfere with hypnosis.

E: Openness. As I thought earlier, this seems to fit. Openness to experiences, imaginative, etc., would make someone more susceptible to hypnosis.

F: Ambition. That's more about drive and achievement, which doesn't seem related.

G: Altruism. That's part of Agreeableness, so same as option A.

H: Extraversion. This includes being sociable and assertive. I don't think extraversion directly ties into hypnotizability, unless extroverts are more easily influenced, but I'm not certain. I think Openness is a stronger candidate.

I: Conscientiousness. This is about organization and responsibility. Doesn't seem relevant here.

J: Self-efficacy. That's about believing in your own abilities. Not sure how that connects to hypnosis.

So, putting it all together, the best fit seems to be Openness, which is option E. People high in Openness are more imaginative and open to new experiences, which probably makes them more easily hypnotized.

The question asks which Big Five personality dimension people who are easily hypnotized are likely to score high on. The Big Five traits are Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. Hypnotizability is often linked to traits like imagination and receptivity to suggestions, which align with the Openness dimension. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Agreeableness**: Involves cooperation and compassion, not directly related to hypnotizability.
- **B: Emotional stability**: Refers to calmness and stress management, not a key factor for hypnosis.
- **C: Assertiveness**: Part of Extraversion, involving confidence and outgoingness, which may not correlate with being easily hypnotized.
- **D: Neuroticism**: Involves sensitivity to stress and negative emotions, unlikely to enhance hypnotizability.
- **E: Openness**: Includes imagination and openness to experiences, making it the most relevant trait for hypnotizability.
- **F: Ambition**: Relates to drive and achievement, unrelated to hypnosis.
- **G: Altruism**: Part of Agreeableness, similar to option A.
- **H: Extraversion**: Involves sociability and assertiveness, not directly tied to hypnotizability.
- **I: Conscientiousness**: Pertains to organization and responsibility, irrelevant here.
- **J: Self-efficacy**: Involves belief in one's abilities, not directly connected to hypnosis.

The best fit is **Openness (E)**, as it encompasses traits like imagination and receptivity, which are key for hypnotizability.

Answer: E
