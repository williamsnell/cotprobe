Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the solubility of barium sulfate (BaSO4) in water at 25°C. They give me the Ksp value, which is 1e-10. Hmm, right, Ksp is the solubility product constant, which tells me about the solubility of a sparingly soluble salt.

Alright, I remember that when a sparingly soluble salt like BaSO4 dissolves in water, it dissociates into its ions. The formula for BaSO4 is Ba²+ and SO4^2- ions. So the dissolution equation should be BaSO4(s) ⇌ Ba²+(aq) + SO4^2-(aq). 

Now, the solubility product Ksp is the product of the concentrations of the ions, each raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients. In this case, both ions have a coefficient of 1, so Ksp = [Ba²+][SO4^2-].

Let me denote the solubility of BaSO4 as 's'. That means when BaSO4 dissolves, it produces 's' moles per liter of Ba²+ and 's' moles per liter of SO4^2-. So, [Ba²+] = s and [SO4^2-] = s. 

Putting that into the Ksp expression: Ksp = s * s = s². So, s² = Ksp = 1e-10. To find s, I take the square root of 1e-10. 

Wait, what's the square root of 1e-10? Let me think. 1e-10 is the same as 10^-10. The square root of 10^-10 is 10^(-10/2) = 10^-5. So s = 1e-5 M. 

Wait, but let me double-check that. Because Ksp is 1e-10, which is a really small number, so the solubility should be low. If s is 1e-5, that makes sense because when you square it, you get 1e-10. 

Looking at the options, option A is 1e-5, which matches what I got. But wait, let me check the other options to be sure. Option J is 1e-6, which is smaller, but that would give a Ksp of 1e-12, which doesn't match. Option B is 1e-4, which squares to 1e-8, which is bigger than 1e-10, so that's not right. 

So the correct solubility should be 1e-5 M, which is option A. 

Wait, but another thought: sometimes when the stoichiometry is different, you have to adjust the exponents. Like if the formula was something like AB3, then Ksp would be s*s^3 = s^4. But in this case, BaSO4 dissociates into two ions each with a 1:1 ratio, so the exponents are both 1. So my initial approach is correct. 

Yes, so I'm confident that the solubility is 1e-5 M, so the answer is A.

To determine the solubility of BaSO₄ in water at 25°C, we start with the dissolution equation:

\[
\text{BaSO}_4(s) \leftrightharpoons \text{Ba}^{2+}(aq) + \text{SO}_4^{2-}(aq)
\]

Let the solubility of BaSO₄ be \( s \) (in mol/L). From the stoichiometry of the reaction, the concentrations of \(\text{Ba}^{2+}\) and \(\text{SO}_4^{2-}\) are both equal to \( s \). The solubility product constant (\(K_{sp}\)) is given as:

\[
K_{sp} = [\text{Ba}^{2+}][\text{SO}_4^{2-}] = s \cdot s = s^2
\]

Substituting \( K_{sp} = 1 \times 10^{-10} \):

\[
s^2 = 1 \times 10^{-10}
\]

Taking the square root of both sides:

\[
s = \sqrt{1 \times 10^{-10}} = 1 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the solubility of BaSO₄ is \( 1 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M} \). Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**A: 1 × 10⁻⁵ M**
