Okay, so I've got this math problem here: 123 divided by 8. Hmm, I need to find out what the quotient and remainder are. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that division is about seeing how many times the divisor (which is 8 here) can fit into the dividend (123) completely, and what's left over is the remainder. So I need to figure out how many times 8 goes into 123 without exceeding it.

Let me start by estimating. I know that 8 times 10 is 80, which is less than 123. But I need a larger number. Maybe 15 times 8? Let me calculate that. 15 times 8 is 120. Oh, because 10 times 8 is 80, and 5 times 8 is 40, so 80+40=120. That's pretty close to 123.

So 15 times 8 is 120. Subtracting that from 123 gives me 123 - 120 = 3. So the remainder is 3. That would mean the answer is 15 with a remainder of 3.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe there's a bigger multiple of 8 that fits into 123. Let's try 16 times 8. 16 times 8 is 128. Oh wait, that's more than 123, so that's too big. So 15 is the largest whole number where 8 fits into 123.

So putting it together, 123 divided by 8 is 15 with a remainder of 3. Now I need to look at the options provided.

Looking at the options, option B is 15 remainder 3. That matches what I just calculated. Let me make sure none of the other options fit. Option A is 15 rem 1, which is too low. Option C is 15 rem7, which is higher than I got. Option D is 16 rem1, which doesn't fit because 16*8 is 128, which is more than 123. So option B must be correct.

The correct answer is B: 15 remainder 3.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. Divide 123 by 8 to find how many whole times 8 fits into 123.
2. Calculate 15 ร 8 = 120, which is the largest multiple of 8 less than 123.
3. Subtract 120 from 123 to find the remainder: 123 - 120 = 3.
4. Therefore, 123 รท 8 equals 15 with a remainder of 3.

The correct option is B.
