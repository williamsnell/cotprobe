Okay, so I have this problem here about mixing silver alloys. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. So the question is, how many ounces of a 28% silver alloy must be mixed with 24 ounces of an 8% silver alloy to get a new alloy that's 20% silver. The options are from A to J, but I'll focus on understanding the problem first.

Alright, so let me break it down. There are two alloys being mixed. The first one is 28% silver, but I don't know how much of it I'm using. Let's call that amount x ounces. The second alloy is 8% silver, and I'm using 24 ounces of that.

The goal is to find x such that when I mix these two, the resulting alloy is 20% silver. So I need to set up an equation that represents the total silver before and after mixing.

Wait, right, the total silver in the mixture should equal the sum of silver from each part. So the silver from the first alloy (28% of x ounces) plus the silver from the second alloy (8% of 24 ounces) should equal 20% of the total mixture.

Let me write that out in math terms. So for the first alloy, silver is 0.28 * x ounces. The second alloy contributes 0.08 * 24 ounces. The total mixture will be x + 24 ounces, and 20% of that is the total silver.

Putting it all together, the equation would be:

0.28x + (0.08 * 24) = 0.20 * (x + 24)

Okay, let me compute each part. 0.08 times 24 is... 24 * 0.08 equals 1.92 ounces. So the second alloy contributes 1.92 ounces of silver.

The right side is 0.20*(x +24). Let me expand that: 0.20x + 4.8.

So putting it back into the equation:

0.28x + 1.92 = 0.20x + 4.8

Now I need to solve for x. Let me subtract 0.20x from both sides to get the x terms on one side.

0.28x - 0.20x +1.92 = 4.8
0.08x +1.92 =4.8

Now subtract 1.92 from both sides:

0.08x = 4.8 -1.92
0.08x = 2.88

So x is 2.88 divided by 0.08. Let me calculate that: 2.88 / 0.08 equals... Hmm, 0.08 goes into 2.88 how many times? Well, 0.08 times 36 is 2.88 because 0.08 *30 is 2.4, and 0.08*6 is 0.48. 2.4 + 0.48 is 2.88. So x is 36 ounces.

Wait, so the answer is 36 ounces of the 28% alloy. Looking at the options, let me check. Option F is 36 ounces. So the correct answer should be F.

But wait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me double-check the equation.

So, 28% of 36 ounces is 0.28 *36 = 10.08 ounces of silver. The 24 ounces at 8% gives 1.92 ounces. Total silver is 10.08 +1.92 =12 ounces. The total mixture is 36 +24 =60 ounces. 12/60 is 0.20, which is 20%. Yep, that checks out. So I did it right.

To determine how many ounces of a 28% silver alloy (let this amount be \( x \)) must be mixed with 24 ounces of an 8% silver alloy to produce a new alloy that is 20% silver, we set up the following equation:

\[
0.28x + (0.08 \times 24) = 0.20 \times (x + 24)
\]

First, calculate the contribution of silver from the 8% alloy:
\[
0.08 \times 24 = 1.92 \, \text{ounces}.
\]

Next, expand the right-hand side of the equation:
\[
0.20 \times (x + 24) = 0.20x + 4.8.
\]

Substitute these values into the equation:
\[
0.28x + 1.92 = 0.20x + 4.8.
\]

Rearrange to isolate \( x \):
\[
0.28x - 0.20x + 1.92 = 4.8,
\]
\[
0.08x + 1.92 = 4.8.
\]

Subtract 1.92 from both sides:
\[
0.08x = 2.88.
\]

Solve for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{2.88}{0.08} = 36 \, \text{ounces}.
\]

Thus, 36 ounces of the 28% silver alloy must be mixed with 24 ounces of the 8% silver alloy to produce a 20% silver alloy. Verifying, the total silver in the mixture is:
\[
0.28 \times 36 + 0.08 \times 24 = 10.08 + 1.92 = 12 \, \text{ounces}.
\]
The total mixture is \( 36 + 24 = 60 \) ounces, and \( 12 / 60 = 0.20 \), confirming the result is correct.

The correct answer is **F: 36 ounces**.
