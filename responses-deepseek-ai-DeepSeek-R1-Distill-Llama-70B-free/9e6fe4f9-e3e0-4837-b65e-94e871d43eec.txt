Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Piaget's theory of cognitive development. Hmm, I remember Piaget proposed different stages, each with specific concepts. Let me think through each option one by one.

The question asks which concept and stage are correctly matched. The options are from A to J. 

First, I need to recall the stages and the concepts associated with each. Piaget's stages are: sensorimotor (0-2 years), preoperational (2-7), concrete operational (7-11), and formal operational (11 and up).

Now, let's go through each term:

A: Centration—sensorimotor stage. Centration is when a child focuses on one aspect and ignores others. I think centration is more about the preoperational stage, like in the conservation tasks. Sensorimotor is more about sensory experiences and motor skills. So A might not be correct.

B: Conservation—sensorimotor. Conservation is the understanding that quantities remain the same despite changes in appearance. I believe conservation is achieved in the concrete operational stage, around 7 years old. Sensorimotor is too early for that, so B is wrong.

C: Object permanence—concrete operational. Object permanence is the understanding that objects continue to exist even when out of sight. I think that's from the sensorimotor stage, like when infants start understanding it around 6-9 months. So C is incorrect.

D: Egocentrism—formal operational. Egocentrism is the child's inability to see things from others' perspectives. It's a feature of the preoperational stage, not formal. So D is wrong.

E: Egocentrism—sensorimotor. Sensorimotor is before egocentrism, which is more preoperational. So E is wrong.

F: Object permanence—preoperational. No, object permanence is earlier, so F is incorrect.

G: Conservation—formal. Conservation happens in concrete, so G is wrong.

H: Hypothetical-deductive reasoning—formal. Yes, formal operational stage is where abstract thinking and hypothetical reasoning develop. So H looks correct.

I: Hypothetical-deductive—preoperational. Preoperational is more about intuitive thinking, not deductive reasoning. So I is wrong.

J: Centration—concrete. Centration is part of the preoperational stage, like when kids focus on one aspect in conservation tasks. So J is wrong.

Wait, let me double-check. Centration is indeed a part of the preoperational stage. So J, which links it to concrete operational, isn't right.

So the correct answer should be H: Hypothetical-deductive reasoning in formal operational stage.

The correct answer is H. According to Piaget's theory, hypothetical-deductive reasoning is a hallmark of the formal operational stage, where individuals develop the ability to think abstractly and reason logically about abstract concepts.

Answer: H
