Okay, so I've got this problem about neutron flux and cobalt activity. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

Alright, the problem says that a slow neutron flux of 10^12 neutrons per cm² bombards a cobalt sample for six months. The cross section of ^59Co is 21.7 barns, and ^60Co has a half-life of 5.26 years. I need to find the net activity of the cobalt sample from the given options.

Wait, wait, activity calculations. Right, activity depends on the number of decays per second. But first, I think I need to find out how much of ^60Co is produced here.

So, the process is probably that ^59Co absorbs a neutron to become ^60Co. Because when you bombard with neutrons, neutron capture is common. So the reaction is ^59Co + n → ^60Co.

But wait, do I know the initial amount of ^59Co? The problem doesn't say, but maybe I'm supposed to assume that the sample is pure ^59Co and that the amount is 1 mole or something. Wait, no, the activity is per gram, so maybe I can find the specific activity.

Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that all the cobalt is ^59Co and that after irradiation, some of it becomes ^60Co. But wait, the question is about the activity after six months. So I think I need to calculate the activity of ^60Co produced.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the number of neutrons that bombarded the sample. The flux is given as 10^12 neutrons/cm² per second? Wait, the units are per cm², but what's the time? Oh, the flux is for six months. Wait, no, the flux is the number per cm², but the duration is six months. So I think the total number of neutrons is flux multiplied by time.

Wait, actually, flux is typically given in neutrons per cm² per second. So if the flux is 1e12 neutrons/cm², that's per second? Wait, no, in nuclear physics, flux Φ is often in neutrons per cm² per second. So if Φ is 1e12 cm^-2 s^-1, then over time t, the total is Φ * t.

Wait, the problem says the flux is 10^12 neutrons per cm², but it doesn't specify the time unit. Wait, no, no, the flux is given as 10^12 neutrons per cm². Oh wait, no, the problem states: "a slow neutron flux of 10^12 neutrons per cm² bombards a sample... for a period of six months." So does that mean the total number is 1e12 neutrons/cm² over six months? Or is the flux 1e12 per cm² per second, and the time is six months? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, no, more accurately, neutron flux is usually the number per area per time. So for example, if the flux is Φ neutrons/cm²/s, then over time t, the total number is Φ * t. But the problem says the flux is 1e12 neutrons/cm². That's probably per second. Or wait, perhaps the total number of neutrons per cm² during the entire six months is 1e12. Let me think about the units.

Wait, the problem states "a slow neutron flux of 10^12 neutrons per cm^2 bombards a sample of cobalt for a period of six months." So perhaps the flux is 1e12 neutrons per cm² per second, and the time is six months. Or wait, no, maybe the total number is 1e12 per cm² over the six months. Hmm. Wait, that doesn't make much sense because flux is per unit time.

Wait, I think I need to clarify this. Let's think: neutron flux is Φ = n / (cm² * s), so the total number that hit the sample per cm² is Φ * t, where t is the time in seconds. So if the flux is 1e12 neutrons/cm² per second, and the time is six months, then the total is 1e12 * t.

Wait, but the problem says the flux is 1e12 neutrons per cm². So maybe that's the total number, not per second. So if the flux is 1e12 neutrons/cm² over six months, then the flux per second would be (1e12) / (t in seconds). Hmm, but that seems more complicated.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the total number of neutrons that have bombarded the sample. So the flux is 1e12 neutrons per cm², and the time is six months. So I think the total number of neutrons per cm² is 1e12 multiplied by the number of seconds in six months.

Wait, no, that would be if the flux was per second. Let me think again. Flux Φ is in neutrons per cm² per second. So the total number hitting the sample is Φ * t, where t is in seconds.

Wait, but the problem states that the flux is 1e12 neutrons/cm². So perhaps that's per second. So then, the total number is 1e12 * t, where t is the time in seconds.

Wait, no, it's possible that the problem is using "bombards for six months" as the duration, so the flux is 1e12 per cm² per second, and the time is six months. So let's compute the total neutron exposure as Φ * t.

Wait, but actually, the formula for neutron capture is N = σ * Φ * N0 * (1 - e^(-λt)), but since the irradiation time is long compared to the half-life, maybe it's just σ * Φ * N0. Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating things.

Wait, the standard formula for activity after irradiation is A = λ * N, where N is the number of radioactive atoms. So to find N, the number of ^60Co atoms, we can calculate the number of ^59Co atoms that captured a neutron.

The number of captures is given by N_captured = N_initial * σ * Φ_total, where σ is the cross-section in cm², Φ_total is the total neutron flux (neutrons per cm²). Wait, is that right?

Wait, the reaction rate is given by the product of neutron flux (Φ), cross-section (σ), and the number of target nuclei (N). So the total number of captures is N_captured = N_initial * σ * Φ_total, where Φ_total is the total number of neutrons per cm².

Wait, but wait, Φ is usually in neutrons per cm² per second. So if Φ is the flux (neutrons/cm²/s), then the total fluence (neutrons/cm²) is Φ * t.

So the number of captures is N_captured = N_initial * σ * Φ * t.

Wait, but σ is in barns, and 1 barn is 1e-24 cm². So we'll need to convert the cross-section from barns to cm².

So the steps:

1. Convert the cross-section σ from barns to cm². 21.7 barns = 21.7e-24 cm².

2. Calculate the total neutron fluence Φ_total = Φ * t, where Φ is 1e12 neutrons/cm²/s, and t is the time in seconds.

Wait, wait, the problem states the flux is 1e12 neutrons/cm², and the irradiation is for six months. So perhaps Φ is 1e12 neutrons/cm² per second, and t is six months in seconds.

Wait, but actually, that would be a huge number. Let me compute t in seconds.

Six months is approximately 6 * 30 days = 180 days. One day is 86400 seconds, so 180 * 86400 = 15,552,000 seconds. Wait, wait, 6 months is about 183 days. So 183 * 86400 ≈ 15,805,200 seconds.

Wait, but if the flux is 1e12 neutrons/cm²/s, and the time is ~1.58e7 seconds, then Φ_total would be 1e12 * 1.58e7 = 1.58e19 neutrons/cm². That seems way too high. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the flux.

Alternatively, perhaps the flux is 1e12 neutrons/cm² over the entire six months. So the total fluence is 1e12 neutrons/cm².

Wait, that would make more sense. So Φ_total = 1e12 neutrons/cm². Then the calculation is N_captured = N_initial * σ * Φ_total.

But wait, what's N_initial? The number of ^59Co atoms in the sample. But the problem doesn't give the mass of the sample. Wait, the question is asking for activity per gram. Oh, so maybe we can express everything per gram.

So, the number of ^59Co atoms per gram. Let me compute that.

The atomic weight of Co is about 59 g/mol. Wait, ^59Co has a molar mass of 59 g/mol. So the number of atoms per gram is Avogadro's number divided by 59 g/mol.

Avogadro's number is ~6.022e23 atoms/mol. So per gram, that's 6.022e23 / 59 ≈ 1.02e22 atoms/g.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 6.022e23 / 59 = approximately 1.02e22 atoms per gram.

So N_initial = 1.02e22 atoms/g.

Now, the cross-section σ is 21.7 barns = 21.7e-24 cm².

So N_captured per gram is N_initial * σ * Φ_total.

Φ_total is 1e12 neutrons/cm².

So N_captured/g = (1.02e22 atoms/g) * (21.7e-24 cm²) * (1e12 neutrons/cm²).

Calculating that:

1.02e22 * 21.7e-24 = (1.02 * 21.7) * 1e-2.

1.02 *21.7 ≈ 22.134, so 22.134e-2 = 0.22134.

Multiply by 1e12: 0.22134 * 1e12 = 2.2134e11 atoms captured per gram.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, let me redo that calculation.

Wait, N_captured = N_initial * σ * Φ_total.

N_initial per gram is 1.02e22 atoms/g.

σ is 21.7e-24 cm².

Φ_total is 1e12 neutrons/cm².

So multiplying all together:

1.02e22 * 21.7e-24 * 1e12 = let's compute the exponents first.

1e22 * 1e-24 = 1e-2.

Then, 1e-2 * 1e12 = 1e10.

So the numbers without exponents: 1.02 *21.7 = approx 22.134.

So total is 22.134 * 1e10 = 2.2134e11 atoms of ^60Co per gram.

Wait, 2.2e11 atoms per gram.

Now, the activity A is λ*N, where λ is the decay constant.

The half-life T½ is 5.26 years. Let's convert that to seconds.

One year is ~3.154e7 seconds, so 5.26 years is 5.26 * 3.154e7 ≈ 1.658e8 seconds.

The decay constant λ = ln(2)/T½ ≈ 0.693 / 1.658e8 ≈ 4.176e-9 s^-1.

So, A = λ * N.

N is 2.2134e11 atoms/g.

So A = 4.176e-9 s^-1 * 2.2134e11 atoms/g = ?

Multiply 4.176e-9 * 2.2134e11.

4.176e-9 * 2.2134e11 = 4.176 * 2.2134 * 1e2.

4.176 * 2.2134 ≈ let's compute:

4 * 2.2134 = 8.8536,

0.176 * 2.2134 ≈ 0.390.

So total ≈ 9.2436.

Multiply by 1e2 → 924.36 decays per second per gram.

Wait, but 1 curie is 3.7e10 decays per second. So to convert to curies, divide by 3.7e10.

So 924.36 / 3.7e10 ≈ 2.498e-8 curies/g.

Wait, that's way too low. That can't be right. None of the options are that low.

Hmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me check my steps again.

Wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents. Let me recalculate N_captured.

N_captured = 1.02e22 atoms/g * 21.7e-24 cm² * 1e12 neutrons/cm².

Let me compute the exponents step by step.

1e22 * 1e-24 = 1e-2.

Then multiply by 1e12: 1e-2 * 1e12 = 1e10.

Now the coefficients: 1.02 * 21.7 = 22.134.

So N_captured = 22.134 * 1e10 = 2.2134e11 atoms/g.

Wait, that seems correct.

Then λ: T½ is 5.26 years = 5.26 * 365.25 days = let's compute that more accurately.

Wait, 5.26 * 365.25 = 5*365.25 = 1826.25, 0.26*365.25 ≈ 94.875, so total ≈ 1921.125 days.

Each day is 86400 seconds, so 1921.125 * 86400 ≈ let's compute:

1921 * 86400 = ?

Well, 2000 *86400 = 172,800,000.

Minus 79 *86400.

79 *86400 = approx 79 *8.64e4 = 6.816e6.

So 172.8e6 - 6.816e6 = 166.0e6 seconds.

Wait, that's roughly 1.66e8 seconds.

So λ = 0.693 / 1.66e8 ≈ 4.17e-9 s^-1. That part seems correct.

So A = λ*N = 4.17e-9 * 2.2134e11 = let's compute: 4.17e-9 * 2.2134e11 = (4.17 * 2.2134) * 1e2.

4.17 *2.2134 ≈ let's calculate:

4*2.2134=8.8536,

0.17 *2.2134 = ~0.3762,

Total ≈ 9.2298.

So 9.2298e2 decays/s = 922.98 Bq.

Convert to curies: 1 Ci = 3.7e10 Bq.

So 922.98 / 3.7e10 = approx 2.495e-8 Ci/g.

Wait, that's about 0.0249 microCuries per gram. But the options are all around 0.6 to 1.5 Ci/g. That's way off. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe I got the cross-section conversion wrong. Let me check.

Cross-section σ is 21.7 barns. 1 barn is 1e-24 cm², so 21.7 barns = 21.7e-24 cm². That seems correct.

Wait, but perhaps the flux is 1e12 neutrons per cm² per second, and the time is six months, so the total fluence is 1e12 * t, where t is in seconds.

Wait, that would make Φ_total = 1e12 * 1.66e8 s ≈ 1.66e20 neutrons/cm².

Hmm, that's a higher number.

Wait, perhaps the flux is 1e12 per cm² per second, so over six months, the fluence is 1e12 * 1.66e8 = 1.66e20 neutrons/cm².

Then, N_captured = N_initial * σ * Φ_total.

N_initial is 1.02e22 atoms/g.

σ is 21.7e-24 cm².

Φ_total is 1.66e20 neutrons/cm².

So N_captured = 1.02e22 * 21.7e-24 * 1.66e20.

Calculating the exponents first: 1e22 * 1e-24 = 1e-2, then 1e-2 *1e20 = 1e18.

Coefficients: 1.02 * 21.7 * 1.66.

Compute 1.02 *21.7 = 22.134.

22.134 * 1.66 ≈ 36.742.

So N_captured ≈ 36.742 * 1e18 = 3.6742e19 atoms/g.

Wait, that can't be right because you can't have more atoms than you started with. Wait, no, if it's per gram, and you have 1e22 atoms/g, but N_captured is 3.67e19 atoms/g. So that's about 0.0367 of the initial atoms being converted, which is possible.

Now, compute the activity.

λ is the same as before, 4.17e-9 s^-1.

A = λ * N = 4.17e-9 * 3.6742e19 = (4.17 *3.6742) * 1e10.

4.17 *3.6742 ≈ let's compute: 4 *3.6742=14.6968, 0.17*3.6742=0.6245. Total ≈15.3213.

So 15.3213e10 decays/s → 1.53213e11 Bq.

Convert to curies: 1.53213e11 / 3.7e10 ≈ 4.14 Ci/g.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options either. So I'm getting confused here. Maybe my initial approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering secular
