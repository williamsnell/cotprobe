Okay, so I have this math problem here: 145 plus 281 plus 62. I need to find the exact sum and choose the correct option from A to J. Let me think about how to approach this. 

First, maybe I can add the numbers step by step. Let's start by adding 145 and 281. Hmm, 145 plus 200 would be 345, but wait, 281 is 200 plus 80 plus 1. So, 145 plus 200 is 345, then add 80 which makes it 425, and then add 1, so 426. So, 145 + 281 equals 426.

Now, I need to add 62 to that result. So 426 plus 62. Let me break it down again. 426 plus 60 is 486, and then plus 2 makes 488. So the total sum should be 488.

Looking back at the options, A is 488. So that should be the correct answer. But wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Another way to add them all together might be to align them vertically:

  145
+281
+ 62
------
Let's add the units place: 5 + 1 + 2 = 8.
Then the tens place: 4 + 8 + 6 = 18. So I write down 8 and carry over 1.
Hundreds place: 1 + 2 + 0 (since 62 doesn't have a hundreds digit) plus the carried 1 makes 4.

So that gives us 488 again. Yep, that's correct. So the answer must be option A.

The sum of 145, 281, and 62 is calculated step by step. Adding 145 and 281 gives 426, then adding 62 results in 488. Verifying through vertical addition confirms the result.
