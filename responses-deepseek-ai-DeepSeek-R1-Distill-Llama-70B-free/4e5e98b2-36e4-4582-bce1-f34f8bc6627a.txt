Okay, so I have this question about corporations and their characteristics. I'm a bit rusty on my business law, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says: A corporation is ________ from its managers, employees, investors, and customers. It therefore has _______ succession and also ________. The options are from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that one of the key features of a corporation is its separate legal personality. So the corporation is a separate entity from the people involved with it. That means it's independent or distinct from its managers, employees, etc. So the first blank should be something like 'independent' or 'separate'.

Wait, looking at the options, let's see. Option E says "Independent, Perpetual, Owns its own assets." That sounds familiar. Another option is B: "Independent, Limited, Owns its own assets." Wait, what's the difference between 'limited' and 'perpetual'?

Oh right, I think the concept here is perpetual succession. Corporations have perpetual succession, meaning that the corporation continues to exist even if the people involved change. So the second blank is 'perpetual succession'.

Wait, no, the question says it "has ______ succession." So the second blank would be filled with 'perpetual' because that's a key feature. So the second part is 'perpetual succession'.

Now, the third blank: does the corporation own its own assets? I remember that because it's a separate legal entity, the corporation owns its assets, not the shareholders or managers. So the third part should be something like 'owns its own assets'.

Putting it together: The first blank is 'independent', second is 'perpetual', third is 'owns its own assets'.

Looking at the options, option E is "Independent, Perpetual, Owns its own assets." That fits.

Wait, let me double-check. Another option is B, which says 'Limited' for the second blank. No, that doesn't fit because 'limited' usually refers to liability, not succession. So the second blank is definitely 'perpetual'.

So the correct answer should be option E.

The question asks about the characteristics of a corporation in relation to its stakeholders, its succession, and its asset ownership. A corporation is recognized as a separate legal entity, making it independent from its managers, employees, investors, and customers. This separation grants the corporation perpetual succession, meaning it continues to exist regardless of changes in its stakeholders. Additionally, as a separate entity, the corporation owns its own assets. 

Analyzing the options, the correct choice is E: Independent, Perpetual, Owns its own assets.

E
