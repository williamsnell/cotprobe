Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the volume of oxygen needed to burn butane completely. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on stoichiometry, but let's see if I can work through it.

The problem states the equation: 2 C4H10 + 13 O2 → 8 CO2 + 10 H2O. I need to find out how much O2 is needed to burn 1000 cubic feet of butane. The options are given from A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I remember that stoichiometry involves using the mole ratios from the balanced equation. But wait, the volumes here are in cubic feet. Oh right, at the same temperature and pressure, the volume of gases is proportional to moles. So I can treat the volumes directly as if they were moles because the ratio would stay the same.

Looking at the balanced equation: 2 moles (or volumes) of C4H10 react with 13 moles (or volumes) of O2. So the ratio is 2 C4H10 : 13 O2.

I have 1000 cubic feet of C4H10. I need to find out how much O2 is needed. Let me set up a proportion or maybe use the ratio directly.

So for every 2 units of C4H10, you need 13 units of O2. That means the amount of O2 needed is (13/2) times the amount of C4H10.

Wait, let me make sure. If 2 C4H10 requires 13 O2, then 1 C4H10 would need 13/2 O2. So for 1000 C4H10, it would be 1000 * (13/2) = ?

Let me calculate that. 13 divided by 2 is 6.5. So 1000 multiplied by 6.5 is 6500. So that would be 6500 cubic feet of O2 needed.

Wait, but I should double-check my steps. Let me write it out again. The reaction is 2 C4H10 + 13 O2 → products. So the mole ratio is 2:13 (C4H10 to O2). So for each mole of C4H10, the moles of O2 needed are 13/2.

So for 1000 moles (volumes) of C4H10, O2 needed is 1000 * (13/2) = 1000*6.5=6500. That seems right.

Looking at the options, option B is 6500. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me think again. Another way to approach it is to set up a proportion. If 2 C4H10 requires 13 O2, then X O2 is needed for 1000 C4H10.

So cross-multiplying: 2 * X = 13 * 1000 → X = (13 * 1000)/2 = 6500. Yep, same result.

I think I've got it right. So the answer is B: 6500 cubic feet.

To calculate the volume of oxygen required to completely burn 1000 cubic feet of butane gas, we use the balanced chemical equation:

\[
2 \, \text{C}_4\text{H}_{10} + 13 \, \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 8 \, \text{CO}_2 + 10 \, \text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]

From the equation, 2 volumes of butane (\(\text{C}_4\text{H}_{10}\)) react with 13 volumes of oxygen (\(\text{O}_2\)). Therefore, the ratio of \(\text{C}_4\text{H}_{10}\) to \(\text{O}_2\) is \(2:13\).

For 1000 cubic feet of \(\text{C}_4\text{H}_{10}\), the required volume of \(\text{O}_2\) is:

\[
\text{Volume of O}_2 = 1000 \times \frac{13}{2} = 1000 \times 6.5 = 6500 \, \text{cubic feet}.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**B: 6500 cubic feet.**
