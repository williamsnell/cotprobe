Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again.

The question says that a particular character in a species is always transmitted from the mother to the offspring, but never from the father. I need to conclude the mode of inheritance. The options are from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that in genetics, the way traits are passed down can be influenced by various factors like the type of chromosome they're on, epigenetics, or even things like mitochondrial DNA.

First, let's think about where the trait is located. If it's always from the mother, maybe it's something to do with mitochondria. Mitochondria have their own DNA, and I remember that in most animals, mitochondria are passed down maternally. When a sperm fertilizes an egg, the mitochondria from the sperm don't usually make it into the embryo. So, mitochondrial DNA comes from the mother. So if this trait is in the mitochondrial DNA, then it would only come from the mother.

Looking at the options, option G says an extrachromosomal trait is only transmitted by the mother. Extrachromosomal would refer to things like mitochondrial DNA or maybe chloroplast DNA in plants. So G seems relevant here.

But wait, are there other possibilities? Let me think. Another possibility is genomic imprinting. That's when the gene's expression depends on the parent of origin. For example, some genes are imprinted and only active if inherited from the mother or father. If a gene is imprinted and only the maternal allele is active, then the trait would appear regardless of the father's contribution. So option A says it's a result of genomic imprinting favoring maternal alleles. That could also explain it.

Wait, but if the question says the trait is always transmitted from the mother, but never from the father, that could mean that the father's allele isn't passed on. Or it might mean that the father's allele is passed but not expressed. So in imprinting, the gene might be present but silenced. So the trait would show up if the mother passes it, but not if the father does, because the paternal allele is imprinted (silenced).

On the other hand, mitochondrial DNA is only passed from the mother. So if the trait is mitochondrial, the father's DNA doesn't contribute. So the trait would always come from the mother.

So both options A and G could be possibilities. Let me think about the exact wording of the question. It says the character is always transmitted from the mother, but never from the father. So if it's mitochondrial, the father can't pass it on. But if it's imprinting, the father could pass the gene, but it's not expressedâ€”so the trait wouldn't show up from the father.

Wait, but the question is about transmission. If the character is always transmitted from the mother, it's about the presence of the trait, not just the gene. So in imprinting, the father's allele is transmitted (the gene is there), but it's not expressed. So the offspring would receive the allele from the father but not show the trait. So the trait is transmitted only maternally in terms of expression.

But the question is about transmission, not expression. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Let me think again. The trait is always transmitted from the mother. So every offspring gets the trait if the mother has it. But the father cannot transmit it. So if the mother has it, the offspring always has it. If the father has it, the offspring never gets it. That sounds more like mitochondrial inheritance because the father doesn't contribute mitochondria. So in that case, the trait is only transmitted maternally.

Alternatively, if it's an imprinted gene, then the father can pass the gene, but it's silenced. So the offspring would have the gene from both parents, but only the maternal allele is active. So the trait would show up only when the mother passes it. But the father's allele is passed but doesn't express. So the presence of the trait depends on the mother's transmission.

Wait, but the question says the character is transmitted from the mother. So perhaps it's about the trait being present, not just the gene. So in mitochondrial, the trait is only present when the mother passes it. In imprinting, the father's allele is present but not expressed, so the trait is only from the mother.

But the question is phrased in terms of transmission, not expression. So if the father can't transmit the trait, it's more about where the DNA comes from. So mitochondrial would fit because the father's DNA isn't there.

But another thought: there's also something called cytoplasmic inheritance, which includes mitochondria. So G says extrachromosomal, which would include mitochondrial DNA. So G would be correct.

Option A is about genomic imprinting. Imprinting affects whether the gene is expressed, not whether it's transmitted. So the gene is transmitted, but whether it's active depends on the parent.

So in the scenario, the trait is always transmitted from the mother but not the father. So if it's mitochondrial, the father can't transmit it because he doesn't contribute mitochondria. So G fits.

Wait, but could it be something else? Like X-linked? No, because X-linked traits can come from the father if it's an X-linked recessive, for example. Fathers pass the X to daughters. But that doesn't fit because the question says the trait is never transmitted from the father. So an X-linked dominant would affect sons if the father passes it, but wait, fathers can only give X to daughters and Y to sons.

Wait, if the trait is on the X chromosome, fathers can pass it to daughters (since they give X), but not to sons (they give Y). So in that case, the trait could come from the father, but only to daughters. So it's possible for the father to transmit the trait. So option E (sex-linked) wouldn't fit the scenario because the father can transmit it to daughters.

So that's not the case here.

What about Y-linked? If it's Y-linked, only males can pass it to their sons. So in that case, fathers can transmit it only to sons. But the question says the trait is never transmitted from the father. So Y-linked would only go to sons, but in that case, the father does transmit it. So that doesn't fit.

So Y-linked (option C) is not the right answer.

Autosomal dominant (option D) would mean that if the father has it, he can pass it to offspring regardless of gender, so that doesn't fit.

Autosomal with maternal environmental factors (F) would mean that the mother's environment affects the trait. But the question is about genetic transmission, not environment, I think. So F is probably not the answer.

Option B is polygenic with maternal bias. Not sure, but that might involve multiple genes and perhaps environmental factors, but it's not specific to maternal transmission.

Option H is paternal mitochondrial DNA. Wait, but I thought paternal mitochondria don't typically make it into the embryo. So H says the trait is from paternal mitochondrial DNA, which is unlikely. So H is probably not right.

Option J is about paternal epigenetic modifications. If the father's genes are modified epigenetically, but the transmission is only from the mother, then this wouldn't explain it because the question is about the trait being transmitted only from the mother.

So back to options A and G. The key is whether the trait is transmitted (i.e., the DNA is passed) or just expressed.

If it's mitochondrial, the DNA comes only from the mother. So the trait is transmitted only maternally. So G would be correct.

If it's genomic imprinting, the DNA from the father is present but not expressed. So the father can transmit the gene, but it's not active. So the trait wouldn't show up from the father. So the trait is maternally inherited in terms of expression, but the transmission is possible from both parents.

But the question says the trait is transmitted from the mother, not the father. So it's about transmission, not expression. So G seems correct.

Wait, but option A is about genomic imprinting. If the gene is imprinted and only the maternal allele is active, then the father can pass the gene, but the offspring won't express it. So the trait is only seen when the mother passes it. But the gene is transmitted from both parents. So the question is about the transmission of the trait, meaning the expression. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing transmission and expression.

The question says the character is transmitted from the mother. So in imprinting, the gene is transmitted from both, but only the maternal allele is expressed. So the trait is maternally inherited in terms of expression, but the gene is transmitted by both. So the correct answer would be A?

Wait, but the question is about the mode of inheritance. So the mode could be either mitochondrial (extrachromosomal) or imprinted.

Which one fits the scenario better? If the trait is always transmitted from the mother, meaning that all offspring of an affected mother have the trait, but affected fathers don't pass it. That scenario is more consistent with mitochondrial inheritance, because fathers don't contribute mitochondria. So if the mother has the trait in her mitochondria, all her offspring will have it, regardless of the father. And fathers cannot pass it because they don't contribute mitochondria.

On the other hand, if it's imprinting, the father could pass the gene, but it's silenced. So the offspring would have the gene, but not express it. So the trait would not appear when inherited from the father. But the gene is transmitted.

The question is about the transmission of the trait, not the gene. So I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the question says the character is transmitted from the mother but not the father. So if the father can't pass the trait, it's about whether the trait appears in the offspring. So in mitochondrial, the father can't pass the trait because he doesn't contribute that DNA. So if the mother has it, the offspring have it. If the father has it, but doesn't pass it, then the offspring can't get it from him.

In imprinting, the father can pass the gene, but the offspring won't express it. So the trait isn't transmitted from him because it's not expressed, even though the gene is.

So both could fit, but the question is about the mode of inheritance.

In the case of mitochondrial, it's an extrachromosomal (non-nuclear DNA) mode of inheritance. So option G says "an extrachromosomal trait could only be transmitted by the mother." That fits, because mitochondria are extrachromosomal and passed maternally.

Option A is genomic imprinting, which affects gene expression but not transmission.

So the correct answer would be G.

Wait, but looking back, the question is phrased as "the character in a certain species of animal were always transmitted from the mother to the offspring, but never from the father to the offspring." So the trait is transmitted, which I think refers to the presence of the trait, not the gene. So if the father can't pass the trait, perhaps because the gene isn't transmitted, that suggests mitochondrial.

So I think the correct answer is G.

The question asks about the mode of inheritance of a trait that is always transmitted from the mother to the offspring but never from the father. To determine the correct answer, we analyze the options:

1. **Option A (genomic imprinting favoring maternal alleles):** Genomic imprinting involves the silencing of an allele based on its parental origin. If a gene is imprinted and only the maternal allele is active, the trait would appear when inherited from the mother but not from the father. However, this explanation focuses on gene expression, not transmission, as the gene itself could still be transmitted by the father.

2. **Option B (polygenic inheritance with maternal bias):** Polygenic inheritance involves multiple genes, and a maternal bias could influence the trait. However, this does not specifically explain why the trait is never transmitted by the father.

3. **Option C (Y-linked):** Y-linked traits are passed from father to son via the Y chromosome. This contradicts the scenario where the trait is never transmitted by the father.

4. **Option D (autosomal dominant):** Autosomal dominant traits can be transmitted by either parent, which does not fit the scenario where the trait is never transmitted by the father.

5. **Option E (sex-linked):** Sex-linked traits, such as those on the X chromosome, can be transmitted by the father to daughters. This does not align with the scenario where the trait is never transmitted by the father.

6. **Option F (autosomal but influenced by maternal environmental factors):** This option suggests environmental factors influence the trait, but the question focuses on genetic transmission, not environmental effects.

7. **Option G (extrachromosomal trait transmitted only by the mother):** Extrachromosomal inheritance, such as mitochondrial DNA, is passed exclusively from the mother, as paternal mitochondria are typically not transmitted during fertilization. This fits the scenario perfectly, as the trait would always be transmitted by the mother and never by the father.

8. **Option H (paternal mitochondrial DNA):** Paternal mitochondrial DNA is rarely transmitted due to the biology of fertilization, making this option unlikely.

9. **Option I (autosomal recessive):** Autosomal recessive traits can be transmitted by either parent, which does not fit the scenario.

10. **Option J (influenced by paternal epigenetic modifications):** This option focuses on epigenetic changes, which do not explain why the trait is never transmitted by the father.

The most plausible explanation is **Option G**, as mitochondrial DNA is an extrachromosomal trait that is transmitted exclusively by the mother. This aligns with the scenario where the trait is always transmitted by the mother and never by the father.
