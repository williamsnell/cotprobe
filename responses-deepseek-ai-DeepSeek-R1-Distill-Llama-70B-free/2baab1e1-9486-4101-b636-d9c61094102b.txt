Okay, so I've got this biology question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. The question is about which piece of evidence most strongly supports the common origin of all life on Earth. The options are A through J, and I have to choose the correct one. 

First, I'll start by recalling what I know about the common origin of life. From what I remember, the theory of evolution suggests that all life on Earth shares a common ancestor. So the evidence that supports this would be something that shows a deep connection between all living organisms.

Let me look at the options one by one. 

Option A: All organisms reproduce. Well, reproduction is a common feature, but I don't think it's the strongest evidence. I mean, different organisms reproduce in very different ways—some sexually, some asexually. So while it's a shared trait, it's not the most convincing evidence for a single origin.

Option B: All organisms are capable of evolving. Evolution is about change over time, and all life does evolve. But this is more about the process that occurs after life exists, not necessarily the origin itself. So maybe not the best option.

Option C: All organisms require energy. That's true, but again, the ways they obtain energy vary a lot—like photosynthesis vs. respiration. It's a fundamental need, but doesn't directly tie to a common origin.

Option D: All organisms have DNA. Wait, not all. Viruses don't have DNA; some have RNA. So this can't be right because there are exceptions. Plus, DNA is common but the presence alone might not be the strongest evidence.

Option E: All organisms are composed of cells. Hmm, that's a good point. All life is cellular, but again, viruses aren't considered cells. So this doesn't apply universally, which weakens it as evidence for a common origin.

Option F: All organisms respire. Respiration is how organisms produce energy, but again, not all do it the same way. Also, some might not even respire in the traditional sense. So this doesn't seem like the best choice.

Option G: All organisms use essentially the same genetic code. Oh, this rings a bell. The genetic code is nearly universal across all life—same codons for the same amino acids. This suggests that all life has a common ancestor because it's unlikely such a specific system would develop multiple times. This seems like a strong candidate.

Option H: All organisms show heritable variation. Well, this is true, but it's more about the mechanism of evolution (natural selection) rather than the origin. It doesn't directly indicate a common origin as much as it supports how life changes over time.

Option I: All organisms can move. Definitely not. Plants can't move like animals do. So this is incorrect.

Option J: All organisms require water to survive. While many do, there are some organisms that can survive without water for long periods, like certain extremophiles or those in a dormant state. Plus, not all life forms necessarily require water, so this isn't a universal trait.

So, after evaluating each option, option G stands out. The fact that all organisms use the same genetic code strongly suggests a common origin because it's highly unlikely that different life forms would coincidentally develop the same complex system independently. It points to a single origin where this code was established and then passed down through generations.

The question asks which piece of evidence most strongly supports the common origin of all life on Earth. To determine this, it is important to identify a trait that is shared universally across all life forms and suggests a deep connection to a single ancestral source.

- **Option A**: Reproduction is a common feature of life, but it occurs in vastly different ways (e.g., sexual vs. asexual), making it less convincing as evidence for a common origin.  
- **Option B**: The ability to evolve is a fundamental aspect of life, but it describes a process that occurs over time rather than directly supporting a common origin.  
- **Option C**: The need for energy is universal, but the methods of obtaining energy vary significantly, reducing its strength as evidence.  
- **Option D**: Not all organisms have DNA (e.g., RNA viruses), so this cannot be the strongest evidence.  
- **Option E**: While most life is cellular, viruses are not, making this option incomplete.  
- **Option F**: Respiration is not universally consistent across all life forms.  
- **Option G**: The near-universal genetic code, where the same codons correspond to the same amino acids across all life, strongly suggests a common origin. This is highly unlikely to have arisen independently multiple times.  
- **Option H**: Heritable variation is tied to evolution but does not directly indicate a common origin.  
- **Option I**: Not all organisms can move (e.g., plants), so this is incorrect.  
- **Option J**: Not all life requires water to survive, as some extremophiles can exist without it.  

The strongest evidence is **Option G**, as the universality of the genetic code is a compelling indicator of a shared ancestral origin for all life on Earth.
