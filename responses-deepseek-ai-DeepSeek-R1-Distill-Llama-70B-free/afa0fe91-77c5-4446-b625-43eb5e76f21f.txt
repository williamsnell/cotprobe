Okay, so I have this economics question here about the spending multiplier and what lessens its effect. Hmm, I remember that the spending multiplier has to do with how an initial change in spending leads to a larger change in aggregate demand. But there are factors that can make this multiplier effect smaller. I think it's something to do with the economy not being able to increase production as much as the demand increases. 

Wait, the spending multiplier is usually discussed in the context of Keynesian economics. The basic idea is that when there's an increase in spending, it leads to more income for businesses and workers, who then spend more, and so on. But if the economy is already at or near full employment, businesses can't just increase production easily. So instead of producing more, they might raise prices. 

Oh right, the multiplier effect is stronger when the economy has unused resources, like high unemployment or idle factories. But when the economy is close to full capacity, firms respond to increased demand by raising prices rather than increasing output. So if the price level rises when aggregate demand increases, that would make the multiplier smaller because the higher prices reduce the real amount of goods and services being purchased. 

Looking at the options, I need to find a situation where the price level rises as aggregate demand increases. Let me go through the options:

Option C: the price level rises with an increase in aggregate demand. That sounds exactly like what I'm thinking. Because if AD increases and prices go up, the multiplier effect is dampened.

Wait, what about other options? Let me check others to be sure. 

Option E says the price level is constant with an increase in AD. If prices don't change, then the multiplier would be larger because output can increase without price hikes. So that's the opposite of what the question is asking.

Option H: price level is constant with an increase in long-run AS. That's about supply, not directly about demand. 

Option I: price level decreases with a decrease in AD. That's related to deflationary situations, maybe, but not directly about when AD is increasing.

So the correct answer should be option C because when AD increases and prices rise, the multiplier effect is lessened since higher prices reduce the real purchasing power, limiting the increase in output and employment. Therefore, the effect of the spending multiplier is lessened in this scenario.

The spending multiplier is lessened when the price level rises with an increase in aggregate demand. This occurs because, as aggregate demand increases, businesses may respond by raising prices rather than increasing production, especially if the economy is near full employment. Higher prices reduce the real purchasing power of consumers, dampening the multiplier effect. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option C** correctly describes this scenario: the price level rises with an increase in aggregate demand, reducing the multiplier effect.
- Other options, such as **E** (price level constant with an increase in AD), describe situations where the multiplier effect would be stronger, not weaker.
- Options like **H**, **I**, and **J** focus on supply or deflationary scenarios, which are not directly relevant to the question.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**.

Answer: C
