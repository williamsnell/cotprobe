Question:

Describe the two major physiological theories of depression.

Options:

A: The first theory is based on immune system dysfunction, and the second on abnormalities in circadian rhythms.
B: The first theory revolves around genetic predispositions and the second theory focuses on environmental factors.
C: The first theory connects depression to thyroid gland dysfunction, and the second to oxidative stress within neurons.
D: The first theory involves cognitive processes and the second entails behavioral responses.
E: The first theory is concerned with hormonal imbalances and the second with neurotransmitter deficiencies.
F: The first theory suggests an overactivity of the frontal lobe, while the second associates depression with a lack of physical activity.
G: The first theory attributes depression to excessive neuronal cell death, and the second to the malfunctioning of the reward system in the brain.
H: The first theory links depression to a deficiency in vitamin D levels, and the second to fluctuations in blood sugar levels.
I: The first theory implicates disruptions in the gut-brain axis, while the second focuses on deficits in social interaction.
J: The first theory is concerned primarily with electrolyte metabolism and the second with the chemicals involved in neural transmission.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about the two major physiological theories of depression. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that depression is a complex condition, and there are several theories trying to explain its causes. The question is asking specifically about physiological theories, so I should focus on biological factors rather than psychological ones.

I think the two big physiological theories I've heard about are the monoamine hypothesis and something related to neuroendocrine factors, maybe involving hormones. Or wait, maybe one is about neurotransmitters and the other about the brain's reward system or stress response.

Wait, another angle: I remember something about hormonal imbalances, like with cortisol or thyroid hormones. Oh, right, the monoamine theory suggests that low levels of neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine contribute to depression. That's the neurotransmitter deficiency part.

Then, there's the neuroendocrine theory, which involves hormonal imbalances. For example, abnormal levels of cortisol (linked to stress) or maybe issues with thyroid function. Oh wait, I think the HPA (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal) axis is involved here. When the HPA axis is dysregulated, it can lead to increased cortisol, which might contribute to depression.

So looking at the options, I need to find one that mentions both hormonal imbalances and neurotransmitter issues.

Let me go through the options:

A: Immune system and circadian rhythms. I know immune issues might be linked, but I'm not sure if that's a primary theory. Maybe not the two major ones.

B: Genetics and environment. Those are more risk factors than physiological theories explaining the mechanism.

C: Thyroid and oxidative stress. Thyroid issues can cause depression-like symptoms, but I'm not sure if that's one of the two main theories.

D: Cognitive and behavioral. Those are psychological theories, not physiological.

E: Hormonal imbalances and neurotransmitter deficiencies. This sounds right. Monoamine theory is neurotransmitters, and hormonal issues like cortisol would be the other.

F: Frontal lobe overactivity and physical activity. I haven't heard this as a major theory.

G: Neuronal cell death and reward system. Maybe, but I think the reward system is part of neurotransmitter theories, and neuronal death is more related to neurodegenerative diseases.

H: Vitamin D and blood sugar. I don't think these are the primary theories.

I: Gut-brain axis and social interaction. Gut-brain is a newer area, but social interaction is more psychological.

J: Electrolytes and neural chemicals. Not the main theories I recall.

So the correct answer should be E: The first theory is concerned with hormonal imbalances and the second with neurotransmitter deficiencies.

The two major physiological theories of depression are best described by option E. The first theory focuses on hormonal imbalances, such as dysregulation of the HPA axis leading to increased cortisol levels. The second theory revolves around neurotransmitter deficiencies, particularly the monoamine hypothesis, which implicates low levels of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine in the development of depression.

Answer: E
