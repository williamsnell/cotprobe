Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about accounting procedures during a review of financial statements for a nonissuer. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, the question is asking which procedure an accountant would least likely perform during such a review. The options are A through I, and I need to figure out the correct answer.

I remember that reviews are less in depth than audits. So in a review, the accountant's main goal is to provide limited assurance that there are no material modifications needed for the financial statements to be in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework. They do this by performing analytical procedures, making inquiries, and other review activities.

Looking at the options one by one:

A: Assessing the company's risk management procedures. Wait, isn't risk assessment more of an audit thing? In a review, the accountant might make inquiries about risks, but maybe not assess the entire risk management system as thoroughly as in an audit. So this might be something they don't do as much.

B: Making inquiries about actions taken at board meetings. That sounds like something they would do. Management would know what decisions were made, and the accountant would ask about that as part of their inquiries.

C: Identifying internal control activities to prevent or detect misstatements. Internal controls are more thoroughly evaluated in an audit. In a review, the focus is less on internal controls, so maybe this isn't a primary activity. Or wait, maybe they do some limited procedures related to internal controls. I'm a bit fuzzy here.

D: Studying relationships in financial statements that should follow predictable patterns. That sounds like analytical procedures, which are definitely part of a review. So this is something they would do.

E: Reviewing tax returns. I'm not sure. In a review, maybe they look at the tax returns to check for consistency with the financial statements, but I'm not certain if this is a standard procedure or not.

F: Interviewing employees about their job responsibilities. This seems more like an audit procedure where they assess internal controls by understanding each employee's role. In a review, they might make some inquiries, but perhaps not as detailed as interviewing employees about their specific responsibilities.

G: Evaluating compliance with regulations. Compliance is more of an audit thing, especially for nonissuers. In a review, the accountant isn't expected to evaluate compliance as thoroughly. So maybe this isn't done in a review.

H: Checking mathematical accuracy in ledgers. That's more of a detailed audit procedure, like in substantive testing. Reviews don't typically involve such detailed checks, so this might not be done.

I: Comparing financial statements with budgets and forecasts. That's definitely an analytical procedure, so yes, they would do this in a review.

Wait, the question is which one they least likely do. So let's think about each.

In a review engagement, the accountant performs:

- Analytical procedures: So D and I are likely done.

- Inquiries: So B, E, F, G might be varying degrees.

- Internal control: For an audit, they assess internal controls. In a review, they might not perform tests of controls, but they might make inquiries about changes in internal controls, but not identify internal control activities in depth. So C might not be done.

Wait, but option C says "Identify internal control activities that are likely to prevent or detect material misstatements." That sounds more like what's done in an audit. In a review, the accountant isn't required to assess internal controls. So C is something they wouldn't do in a review.

Looking at the options again, the question is about which procedure is least likely.

Option E: Reviewing tax returns. Do they do that? I'm not so sure. Tax returns are part of the accounting records, but a review might not necessarily involve a detailed review of tax returns unless there's a specific reason. But I'm not certain.

Option G: Evaluating compliance. That's more of an audit thing, especially for nonissuers. Reviews don't typically include compliance evaluation unless it's specifically part of the engagement.

Option H: Checking math in ledgers. That's more detailed testing, which is more audit-like. So in a review, they probably don't do H.

So the options that are least likely are C, E, F, G, H.

Wait, the question is about which one is least likely. So I need to pick the one that's least likely among all.

The correct answer is probably H or E or G.

Wait, another approach: What procedures are typically performed in a review?

In a review, the primary procedures are analytical procedures, making inquiries, and possibly some limited procedures like recalculations or inspections if needed.

So, checking mathematical accuracy (H) is more of a substantive test in an audit, so the accountant wouldn't do that in a review.

Similarly, evaluating compliance (G) is more of an audit procedure. So G is unlikely.

Assessing risk management (A) might be done at a high level, but perhaps not in depth.

So looking back at the options, the least likely would be H, because checking mathematical accuracy is a detailed test. Or maybe G, because compliance evaluation is part of an audit.

Wait, let me think about each option.

Option A: Assessing risk management procedures. In a review, the accountant might discuss with management about risks, but a detailed assessment of risk management is more of an audit. So A is less likely.

Option B: Inquiries about board meetings. Definitely done.

Option C: Internal control activities. Not done in a review.

Option D: Analytical procedures. Done.

Option E: Reviewing tax returns. Maybe done, maybe not, depending on the situation.

Option F: Interviewing employees. Maybe in a review, they make some inquiries, but perhaps not as detailed as in an audit. So maybe F is less likely.

Option G: Evaluating compliance. Unlikely, as it's more of an audit.

Option H: Checking math. Unlikely, more audit.

Option I: Comparing to budgets. Definitely done.

So the question is which is least likely.

So among the options, G and H are more audit-like. Which one is less likely?

I think H is less likely because checking ledgers for math accuracy is a specific test that's more substantive in nature, which is beyond the scope of a review.

Similarly, G is evaluating compliance, which is more involved.

So the procedures an accountant would least likely perform are G and H.

Wait, the options are A to I, so which one is the correct answer?

Looking back at the question, the correct answer is E, G, or H?

I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recall what's included in a review.

In a review engagement for nonissuers, the accountant performs:

- Inquiries of management (so B is done)
- Analytical procedures (so D, I are done)
- Might make some inquiries about internal controls, but not in depth (so C is not done)
- Might not perform detailed tests like checking ledgers (so H is not done)
- Evaluating compliance is not part of a review unless specifically engaged (so G is not done)
- Reviewing tax returns (E) might not be a standard procedure unless relevant.

So, which of these is least likely to be performed.

The options are:

Which would the accountant least likely perform.

So the least likely is either C, E, F, G, H.

I think the answer is H because checking ledgers for math accuracy is a substantive procedure, which is more in line with an audit.

Alternatively, some sources say that in a review, the accountant might perform limited recalculations, but I'm not sure if that's the same as checking for mathematical accuracy in ledgers.

Wait, another approach: the accountant in a review would not perform tests of transactions or balances, which are more detailed.

So, checking mathematical accuracy in the ledgers (H) is a test of transactions, which is not done in a review.

So H is the least likely procedure.

In a review engagement of financial statements for a nonissuer, the accountant's primary focus is on providing limited assurance through analytical procedures, inquiries, and other high-level review activities. The accountant does not perform detailed substantive testing or in-depth evaluations typically associated with audits. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Assessing the company's risk management procedures**  
  While some high-level discussions about risks may occur, detailed risk assessments are more characteristic of audits. This is less likely in a review.

- **B: Making inquiries of management about actions taken at board of directors' meetings**  
  This is a standard procedure in a review, as inquiries of management are a key component.

- **C: Identifying internal control activities that are likely to prevent or detect material misstatements**  
  Internal control evaluations are more thorough in audits. In a review, the focus is not on identifying internal control activities in detail.

- **D: Studying the relationships of financial statement elements expected to conform to predictable patterns**  
  This is an analytical procedure, which is a core part of a review engagement.

- **E: Reviewing the company's tax returns for the period**  
  While tax returns may be reviewed for consistency with financial statements, this is not a standard procedure in all reviews.

- **F: Interviewing employees about their job responsibilities**  
  This is more detailed and typical of audits. In a review, inquiries are generally limited to management.

- **G: Evaluating the company's compliance with regulations**  
  Compliance evaluation is more extensive in audits and not typically part of a review unless specifically engaged.

- **H: Checking for mathematical accuracy in the company's ledgers**  
  This is a detailed substantive test more aligned with audits. Reviews do not typically involve such detailed checks.

- **I: Comparing the financial statements with anticipated results in budgets and forecasts**  
  This is an analytical procedure and a standard part of a review.

The least likely procedure in a review is **H: Checking for mathematical accuracy in the company's ledgers**, as this is a detailed substantive test characteristic of audits, not reviews.

Answer: H
