Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find how many triangles there are with integer side lengths where the maximum side is exactly 11. Hmm, triangles with integer sides and a max side of 11. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that for a set of three sides to form a triangle, they must satisfy the triangle inequality. That is, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. So if the sides are a, b, and c, and let's say c is the maximum (so c is 11 here), then a + b > c, and also a + c > b, and b + c > a. But since c is the maximum, the other two conditions (a + c > b and b + c > a) are automatically satisfied because c is larger than both a and b. So the main condition I need to worry about is a + b > c, which in this case is a + b > 11.

Wait, but in this problem, the maximum side is exactly 11. So all sides must be less than or equal to 11, and at least one side must be exactly 11. Because if all were less than 11, the maximum wouldn't be 11. So the triangles we're counting must have at least one side equal to 11, and the other sides can be from 1 up to 11, but they have to satisfy the triangle inequality.

So how do I count these? Maybe I can think in terms of combinations. Let's say the sides are a, b, and 11, where a and b are integers such that a ≤ b ≤ 11. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because a and b could be in any order, but to avoid double-counting, it's better to consider a ≤ b ≤ 11. But in reality, a and b can each range from 1 to 11, but they have to satisfy a + b > 11, and also a and b must be ≤ 11.

Wait, but since 11 is the maximum, at least one side must be 11. So the triangles can either have one side of 11 and the other two sides less than or equal to 11, or two sides of 11, etc. But I need to ensure that the maximum is exactly 11, so all sides can't be 12 or more.

Wait, no, the problem says the maximum is exactly 11, so all sides are <=11, and at least one side is 11.

So perhaps the approach is to count all possible triples (a, b, c) where c=11, and a and b are positive integers such that a <= b <= 11, and a + b >11.

Wait, but another way is to consider all possible a and b, with a <= b <=11, and a + b >11. Because in a triangle, the two smaller sides must add up to more than the largest side.

Wait, but since c is the maximum, the two other sides a and b must satisfy a + b > c, which is 11. So the problem reduces to finding all pairs (a, b) where a <= b <=11, and a + b >11, and then for each such (a, b), the triplet is (a, b, 11). But wait, that would count each triangle once, assuming a <= b <=11. But what about cases where a is 11 and b is 11? Well, that's allowed.

Wait, but another thing: when a is 11 and b is 11, the third side (c) would be 11 as well, which is allowed. So maybe I should think of it as the triplet (a, b, 11), but with a and b being any positive integers such that a and b are <=11, and a <= b, and a + b >11.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think without fixing the order. Let me think about it: the number of integer-sided triangles with maximum side length exactly 11 is equal to the number of triplets (a, b, c) where a, b, c are positive integers, c=11, and a and b are positive integers such that a <= b <=11 and a + b >11.

Wait, but wait: in the triplet (a, b, c), c is the maximum, so a and b can be anything up to 11, but with a + b >11. Also, since a and b can be arranged in any order, but since I'm considering a <= b, that should cover all unique triplets without duplication.

So the approach would be:

1. Enumerate all possible pairs (a, b) where a ≤ b ≤11.

2. For each such pair, check if a + b >11.

3. Count the number of such pairs.

But wait, is that all? Because in that case, each triplet is (a, b, 11), but what about cases where two of the sides are 11? Like (11, x, 11), where x can vary. But in this approach, a and b include 11 as possibilities.

Wait, let me clarify. For a ≤ b ≤11, and a + b >11. So a can be from 1 to 11, as can b, but a ≤ b.

Let me think of how to count these pairs.

An alternative approach is to fix the maximum side as 11, and the other two sides can be any positive integers a and b where a ≤ b ≤11 and a + b >11.

So the problem reduces to finding the number of pairs (a, b) with a ≤ b ≤11 and a + b >11.

So, how can I compute this?

Let me think about varying a from 1 to 11, and for each a, determine the possible values of b.

For a given a, what is the minimum b that satisfies a + b >11?

Since a ≤ b, for each a, b must be >= a and >= (12 - a). Because a + b >11 => b >11 -a.

But since b must be an integer, b >= (12 -a) if (12 -a) is greater than a, else b can be >= a.

Wait, let me think again.

For each a, b must satisfy two conditions:

1. b >= a (since a <= b)

2. b >= (12 - a) (since a + b >11 => b >11 -a => b >=12 -a)

So for each a, the lower bound on b is the maximum of a and (12 - a).

But since a can vary, let's consider different ranges of a.

Let me consider a from 1 to 11.

For a in 1 to 5:

Because when a <=5, 12 -a >=7. Because for a=1, 12-1=11; a=2, 12-2=10; a=3, 9; a=4,8; a=5,7.

Wait, but for a <=5, 12 -a >=7, which is greater than a (since a is up to 5). So for a from 1 to 5, the lower bound for b is 12 - a.

But also, since b must be <=11, the upper bound is 11.

But wait, but for each a, the values of b must satisfy b >= max(a, 12 -a) and b <=11.

So for a from 1 to 5, max(a, 12 -a) is 12 -a.

So for each a in 1-5, the number of possible b is from (12 -a) to 11, inclusive.

The number of possible b for each a is 11 - (12 -a) +1 = a.

Wait, let me compute that: for a=1, 12-1=11, so b starts at 11, up to 11. So 1 value.

For a=2: 12-2=10, so b from 10 to11: 2 values.

a=3: 12-3=9, b from9-11:3 values.

a=4:12-4=8, b from8-11:4 values.

a=5:12-5=7, b from7-11:5 values.

So for a=1 to 5, the number of b's is 1,2,3,4,5 respectively. Summing these gives 1+2+3+4+5=15.

Now, for a from6 to 11:

In this case, 12 -a is less than a.

Because for a=6, 12-6=6, which is equal to a.

For a=7, 12-7=5 <7.

a=8:12-8=4 <8.

Same for a=9,10,11.

So in this case, the lower bound for b is a, because it's greater than 12 -a.

So for a=6, b must be >=6 and <=11. So number of b's:11-6 +1=6.

a=6:6,7,8,9,10,11: 6 values.

a=7: b from7 to11:5.

a=8:4.

a=9:3.

a=10:2.

a=11:1.

So the counts for a from6 to11 are 6,5,4,3,2,1.

Adding those up:6+5=11, +4=15, +3=18, +2=20, +1=21.

Wait, wait, let me calculate again.

6+5=11, 11+4=15, 15+3=18, 18+2=20, 20+1=21.

So from a=6 to a=11, there are 21 possible (a,b) pairs.

Adding the earlier 15 gives a total of 15+21=36.

Wait, but wait, that's 36 possible pairs (a,b) where a <= b <=11 and a + b >11.

But each pair corresponds to a unique triangle with sides a, b, 11.

So the total number of such triangles is 36.

Looking at the options, option B is 36.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations.

For a=1 to5:

a=1: b from11 to11 → 1.

a=2:10-11 →2.

a=3:9-11→3.

a=4:8-11→4.

a=5:7-11→5.

Total 1+2+3+4+5=15.

For a=6:

b starts at6, so 6,7,8,9,10,11 →6.

a=7:7-11→5.

a=8:8-11→4.

a=9:9-11→3.

a=10:10 and11→2.

a=11:11→1.

Adding 6+5+4+3+2+1=21.

15+21=36.

Yes, that makes sense.

So the answer should be 36, which is option B.

To determine the number of triangles with integer side lengths where the maximum side length is exactly 11, we need to count all valid triangles (a, b, 11) such that:

1. \( a \leq b \leq 11 \) (since 11 is the maximum side).
2. \( a + b > 11 \) (triangle inequality).

### Step 1: Counting pairs \((a, b)\) for \( a \leq b \leq 11 \) and \( a + b > 11 \)
For each \( a \), the minimum value of \( b \) is \( \max(a, 12 - a) \), and \( b \) must also satisfy \( b \leq 11 \). We calculate the number of valid \( b \) values for each \( a \):

- **For \( a = 1 \):** \( b \geq 11 \), so \( b = 11 \). Number of \( b \): 1.
- **For \( a = 2 \):** \( b \geq 10 \), so \( b = 10, 11 \). Number of \( b \): 2.
- **For \( a = 3 \):** \( b \geq 9 \), so \( b = 9, 10, 11 \). Number of \( b \): 3.
- **For \( a = 4 \):** \( b \geq 8 \), so \( b = 8, 9, 10, 11 \). Number of \( b \): 4.
- **For \( a = 5 \):** \( b \geq 7 \), so \( b = 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 \). Number of \( b \): 5.

Total for \( a = 1 \) to \( a = 5 \): \( 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 \).

- **For \( a = 6 \):** \( b \geq 6 \), so \( b = 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 \). Number of \( b \): 6.
- **For \( a = 7 \):** \( b \geq 7 \), so \( b = 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 \). Number of \( b \): 5.
- **For \( a = 8 \):** \( b \geq 8 \), so \( b = 8, 9, 10, 11 \). Number of \( b \): 4.
- **For \( a = 9 \):** \( b \geq 9 \), so \( b = 9, 10, 11 \). Number of \( b \): 3.
- **For \( a = 10 \):** \( b \geq 10 \), so \( b = 10, 11 \). Number of \( b \): 2.
- **For \( a = 11 \):** \( b \geq 11 \), so \( b = 11 \). Number of \( b \): 1.

Total for \( a = 6 \) to \( a = 11 \): \( 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 21 \).

### Step 2: Total number of triangles
Adding the counts from both ranges of \( a \), the total number of valid triangles is:

\[
15 + 21 = 36
\]

### Final Answer:
The number of triangles with integer sides and maximum side length 11 is **36**.
