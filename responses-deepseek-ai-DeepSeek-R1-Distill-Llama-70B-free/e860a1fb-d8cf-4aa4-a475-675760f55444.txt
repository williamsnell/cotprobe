Okay, so I've got this question about forward contracts, and I need to find the forward price F. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says it's a forward contract on a non-dividend paying stock. The contract matures in 6 months. The current stock price is $50, and the 6-month interest rate is 4% per annum. I need to calculate the forward price.

Wait, okay, I remember that for forward contracts, the forward price is determined by the no-arbitrage principle. The idea is that you can't make a risk-free profit, so the forward price adjusts to avoid that.

So the formula for the forward price F is based on the spot price S, the risk-free rate r, and the time to maturity T. Since the stock doesn't pay dividends, the formula should be simpler. I think the formula is F = S * e^(r*T), but wait, sometimes it's presented as F = S * (1 + r*T) when using simple interest. Or was it compounded?

Wait no, the standard formula for forward price when there are no dividends is F = S * e^(r*T), where r is the continuously compounded interest rate. But wait, sometimes it's written with (1 + r*T), but that's for simple interest. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, let me get this straight. The interest rate given is 4% per annum, and the time is 6 months, which is 0.5 years. So if the rate is 4% annual, the 6-month rate would be 2% if compounded annually, but perhaps it's 4% as a 6-month rate? Wait, no, the question says the 6-month interest rate is 4% per annum. Oh, wait, that's a bit ambiguous. Usually, when it's per annum, it's the annual rate. So for 6 months, if it's compounded annually, it would be 2% for half a year. But if it's a 6-month rate in an annualized term, that might be different. Wait, maybe it's 4% annual, so 2% for 6 months.

Wait, maybe I should clarify the interest rate part. The question says the 6-month interest rate is 4% per annum. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because 4% per annum for 6 months would typically be 2%, right? Because 4% is the annual rate, so half a year would be half of that. So the 6-month rate is 2%.

Wait no, maybe the interest rate is 4% for 6 months. Because sometimes, when people say the 6-month rate is 4% per annum, it's 4% annualized, so for 6 months, the rate is 2%. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think about how the formula applies.

The general formula for forward price when no dividends are paid is F = S * e^(r*T), where r is the risk-free rate applicable for the period. So if T is 6 months, which is 0.5 years, and the rate is 4% per annum, then r would be 4% or 0.04.

So plugging in the numbers: F = 50 * e^(0.04 * 0.5). Let's compute that exponent. 0.04 times 0.5 is 0.02. So e^0.02 is approximately 1.02020134. So 50 multiplied by that is 50 * 1.02020134 ≈ 51.010067. So around 51.01.

Looking at the options, option B is 51.0 and option J is 53.0. Wait, but if the interest rate is 4% per annum, but for 6 months, perhaps the correct rate is 2%, because 4% is annual. So T would be 0.5, and r is 4% annual, so the rate for 6 months would be 2%, or 0.02. So then F would be 50 * e^(0.02) ≈ 50 * 1.02020134 ≈ 51.01, so option B is 51.0.

Wait, but another approach is to consider the present value. The forward contract's price is such that borrowing to buy the stock and delivering it in the future costs the forward price. So the cost of carry is the interest cost. Since there are no dividends, the forward price should be S*(1 + r*T). So S=50, r=4% per annum, T=0.5 years. So 1 + (0.04 * 0.5) = 1 + 0.02 = 1.02. So F = 50 * 1.02 = 51.0.

So that's option B.

Alternatively, sometimes people use continuous compounding, which would be F = S * e^(r*T). But with the numbers, 50 * e^(0.04*0.5) is about 51.01, which is approximately 51.0, so option B.

Alternatively, if the rate given is 4% for 6 months, not annualized, then r would be 8% per annum, but that's not the case here. The question says the 6-month interest rate is 4% per annum, meaning 4% annual rate, so for 6 months, it's 2%.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. If the 6-month interest rate is 4% per annum, that would mean that the rate for 6 months is 4%, but annualized. So for 6 months, the effective rate is 4%, so the annual rate would be 8%? No, that can't be right. Wait, maybe the question is stating that the rate is 4% per annum, and it's a 6-month contract.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think again. The formula for the forward price when there are no dividends is F = S * e^(r*T), where r is the continuously compounded risk-free rate.

Alternatively, if using simple interest, F = S * (1 + r*T).

But wait, the interest rate given is 4% per annum. So for a 6-month period, the simple interest would be 4% * 0.5 = 2%. So F = 50 * (1 + 0.02) = 51.

Or, if it's continuously compounded, r is 4%, so F = 50 * e^(0.04 * 0.5) ≈ 51.01, which is approximately 51.0.

So either way, the forward price is approximately 51.0, which is option B.

Looking at the options, option B is 51.0. So the answer should be B.

To determine the forward price \( F \) of a non-dividend-paying stock, we use the formula derived from the no-arbitrage principle:

\[
F = S \cdot e^{r \cdot T}
\]

where:
- \( S \) is the current stock price (\$50),
- \( r \) is the continuously compounded risk-free interest rate (4% per annum or 0.04),
- \( T \) is the time to maturity in years (6 months or 0.5 years).

### Step 1: Calculate the exponent
\[
r \cdot T = 0.04 \cdot 0.5 = 0.02
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( e^{0.02} \)
Using the approximation \( e^{0.02} \approx 1.02020134 \).

### Step 3: Calculate the forward price
\[
F = 50 \cdot 1.02020134 \approx 51.01
\]

Thus, the forward price is approximately \$51.01, which rounds to \$51.0.

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **B: 51.0**.
