Okay, so I have this problem about Grey's Truck Rental Service, and I need to figure out the price that will maximize their revenues. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the current situation is that they charge $180 per week for a truck, and they rent out an average of 200 trucks per week. Now, if they raise the price by $1, the demand drops by 1 truck per week. So, the question is asking what price would maximize their revenues.

Wait, revenue is calculated as price multiplied by quantity, right? So Revenue = Price × Quantity. So I need to find the price point where this product is the highest possible.

Let me think about how to model this. Let's denote the price increase as 'x' dollars. So the new price would be 180 + x. And for each dollar increase, the quantity demanded decreases by x trucks. So the new quantity would be 200 - x.

So the revenue function R would be (180 + x) multiplied by (200 - x). Let me write that out:

R = (180 + x)(200 - x)

Hmm, to find the maximum revenue, I need to find the value of x that maximizes R. So I should expand this equation and then find its maximum point.

Expanding it:
R = 180*(200 - x) + x*(200 - x)
R = 36,000 - 180x + 200x - x²
Simplify that:
R = 36,000 + 20x - x²

So the equation is R = -x² + 20x + 36,000.

This is a quadratic equation in terms of x, and since the coefficient of x² is negative (-1), the parabola opens downward. That means the vertex of this parabola is the maximum point.

The vertex of a quadratic equation ax² + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a). In this case, a = -1 and b = 20.

So x = -20/(2*(-1)) = -20 / (-2) = 10.

So x equals 10. That means the optimal price increase is $10. So the new price would be the original $180 plus $10, which is $190.

Wait, but let me double-check. If x is 10, then the price is 190, and the quantity is 200 - 10 = 190 trucks. So revenue is 190 * 190 = 36,100. Let me see if that's the maximum.

Let me try x=9: price 189, quantity 191. Revenue is 189 * 191. Let's calculate that. 189 * 200 is 37,800, minus 189*9=1,701. So 37,800 - 1,701 = 36,099. That's a bit less than 36,100.

What about x=11? Price 191, quantity 189. 191*189. Let's see, 200*189=37,800. Subtract 9*189=1,701. So 37,800 - 1,701 = 36,099 again. So yes, x=10 gives the maximum.

Wait, but look at the options given. The options are A to J. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: $210

B: $180

C: $200

D: $220

E: $205

F: $230

G: $215

H: $190

I: $195

J: $175

So according to my calculation, the optimal price is $190, which is option H. But wait, I thought when x=10, the price is 180 +10=190. So yes, H is $190.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. Am I modeling this correctly? The way I set up the problem was that for each $1 increase, quantity drops by 1. So, the relationship is linear. So the revenue function is as I derived.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider marginal revenue and set it equal to zero. Hmm, but I think the approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of calculus. Taking the derivative of the revenue function with respect to x and setting it to zero to find max.

The revenue function is R = -x² + 20x + 36,000.

Derivative dR/dx = -2x + 20. Setting this to zero gives -2x +20=0 → 2x=20 → x=10. So same result.

So, yes, the price should be 180+10=190, which is option H.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option H is 190, which is what I found. So why is the initial thought process questioning it? Maybe I made a mistake, but I don't see where.

Wait, let me check with another approach. Maybe using the formula for the vertex when you have linear demand and cost structures. Oh wait, in this case, it's a monopolist's problem where demand is linear, and you calculate the revenue-maximizing price.

Wait, another way: if demand is Q = 200 - x, and price P = 180 +x, then R = P*Q.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model demand as a function of price. Let me think.

Let me express quantity as a function of price. Let P be the price. Then for each $1 increase, Q decreases by 1. So when P increases by x, Q =200 -x. So P =180 +x → x= P -180. So Q=200 - (P-180) → Q= 200 - P +180 → Q=380 - P.

So Q = 380 - P.

Wait, that seems different. Wait, if P is the price, then Q = 380 - P. So when P=180, Q=200, which matches the initial condition. If P increases by 1, Q decreases by 1, which also matches.

So Revenue R = P * Q = P*(380 - P) → R = 380P - P².

To find maximum R, take derivative dR/dP = 380 - 2P. Setting to zero: 380-2P=0 → P=190.

So same result: P=190. So yeah, the correct answer is H, $190.

To determine the price that maximizes revenues for Grey's Truck Rental Service, we start by defining the relationship between price and quantity demanded. Let the price increase be denoted as \( x \) dollars. The new price becomes \( 180 + x \), and the quantity demanded decreases by \( x \), becoming \( 200 - x \). The revenue function is then:

\[
R = (180 + x)(200 - x)
\]

Expanding this equation:

\[
R = 180(200 - x) + x(200 - x) = 36,000 - 180x + 200x - x^2 = 36,000 + 20x - x^2
\]

This is a quadratic equation of the form \( R = -x^2 + 20x + 36,000 \), where the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is negative, indicating that the parabola opens downward and the vertex represents the maximum revenue. The vertex of a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c \) occurs at \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \). Here, \( a = -1 \) and \( b = 20 \), so:

\[
x = -\frac{20}{2(-1)} = 10
\]

Thus, the optimal price increase is $10. Adding this to the original price of $180 gives a new price of $190. To confirm, substituting \( x = 10 \) into the revenue equation yields:

\[
R = (180 + 10)(200 - 10) = 190 \times 190 = 36,100
\]

Checking values of \( x \) slightly above and below 10 confirms that \( x = 10 \) indeed maximizes revenue. Therefore, the price that maximizes revenues is $190, which corresponds to option H.
