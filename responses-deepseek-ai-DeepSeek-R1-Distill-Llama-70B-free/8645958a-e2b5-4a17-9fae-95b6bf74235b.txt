Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here about Freon-12 in a rigid vessel. Hmm, I need to find the heat transfer when it's heated until it becomes fully saturated vapor. Alright, let's start breaking this down.

The vessel's volume is 0.5 m³. It's filled with Freon-12 at 0.5 MPa and 50°C initially. Then it's heated until it's saturated vapor. So, the process is heating from an initial state (State 1) to a final state (State 2), which is saturated vapor at some temperature.

Wait, since the vessel is rigid, the volume doesn't change. So this is a constant volume process. Oh right, for such processes, the heat transfer can be calculated using Q = m (u2 - u1), where u is the specific internal energy. Alternatively, we might use enthalpy or other properties, but I think internal energy is the way to go here because volume is constant.

First, I need to find the mass of Freon-12 in the vessel. To find mass, I can use the specific volume. Specific volume is volume per unit mass, v = V/m. So m = V/v.

But I need to find the specific volume at the initial state (State 1). The initial pressure is 0.5 MPa (which is 500 kPa) and temperature is 50°C. I should look up the Freon-12 tables to find the specific volume here.

Looking at the Freon-12 tables, at 500 kPa, I'll check the saturation temperatures. Wait, at what temperature does Freon-12 boil at 500 kPa? Let me see. Oh, right, the saturation temperature at 500 kPa is probably around... I think it's like 26.69°C. So, the initial temperature is 50°C, which is higher than the saturation temperature at that pressure. So, the initial state is superheated vapor.

Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure. At 500 kPa, the saturation temp is about 26.69°C. Since the initial temp is 50°C, which is higher, yes, it's superheated vapor. So, State 1 is superheated vapor at 500 kPa and 50°C.

So, from the superheated tables for Freon-12 at 500 kPa and 50°C, I can find the specific volume v1 and the specific internal energy u1.

Looking up v1: At 500 kPa, 50°C, I think the specific volume is about 0.04159 m³/kg. Wait, let me double-check. Oh, wait, no, maybe it's 0.041 m³/kg? Or perhaps higher? Hmm, I might need to be precise here. Alternatively, maybe it's 0.04159 m³/kg. I'll go with that for now.

Then, the mass m is V/v1. V is 0.5 m³. So m = 0.5 / 0.04159 ≈ 12.016 kg. Approximately 12 kg.

Now, the internal energy at State 1, u1: From the table, at 500 kPa and 50°C, u1 is around 270.5 kJ/kg. Wait, or was it 270.5? Or maybe 270. Hmm, I think it's 270.5 kJ/kg.

Wait, I'm a bit unsure about these exact values. Let me think again. The superheated vapor tables for Freon-12 at 500 kPa and 50°C. Oh wait, another approach: maybe using the ideal gas law, but wait, Freon doesn't behave ideally. But since it's superheated vapor, perhaps specific heats could be used. Alternatively, it's easier to look up the exact values.

Wait, maybe I should outline the steps clearly.

1. Determine the state of Freon-12 at initial conditions (500 kPa, 50°C). Since 50°C is above the saturation temperature at 500 kPa (26.69°C), it's superheated vapor.

2. Find specific volume v1 from the superheated table at 500 kPa and 50°C. Let's say v1 = 0.04159 m³/kg.

3. Calculate mass m = V / v1 = 0.5 / 0.04159 ≈ 12.016 kg.

4. Find u1 from the same table: u1 = 270.5 kJ/kg.

5. Now, when the vessel is heated until it's saturated vapor. So, the final state is saturated vapor at some pressure. Since the vessel is rigid, the specific volume remains the same as the initial, v2 = v1 = 0.04159 m³/kg.

Wait, no. Because when you heat it, if the volume is fixed, the pressure will increase, right? Wait, no. Wait, the vessel is rigid, so volume doesn't change. But when you heat a substance in a rigid container, the pressure can change. So, the specific volume v is V/m, which is constant since V is fixed and m is fixed.

Wait, but the process is heating until it becomes saturated vapor. So, the final state is the saturated vapor state at a higher pressure, where the specific volume equals the initial v1. Because the mass is the same, and V is same, so v2 = v1.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. The process is heating the Freon until it's saturated vapor. So, when it's fully saturated vapor, the specific volume will be v_g at that pressure. But since the vessel's volume is fixed, the specific volume is v = V/m, which is the same as initial v1.

So, in the final state, the specific volume v2 must equal v1. So, the final state is the saturated vapor state where v_g equals v1. Therefore, we need to find the pressure at which the saturated vapor specific volume v_g is equal to 0.04159 m³/kg.

Looking at the saturation tables for Freon-12, I need to find the pressure where v_g = 0.04159 m³/kg.

Looking at the table, for example:

At 700 kPa, v_g is 0.0355 m³/kg.

At 600 kPa, v_g is 0.0393 m³/kg.

Wait, but our v1 is 0.04159, which is higher than v_g at 600 kPa. So perhaps we need to go lower than 600 kPa?

Wait, wait, no. Wait, at higher pressures, the v_g decreases. So as pressure increases, v_g decreases. So, at lower pressures, v_g is higher.

Wait, let me think. Let's look at the saturation table:

For Freon-12:

At P = 400 kPa, Tsat = 15.6°C, v_g ≈ 0.0542 m³/kg.

At P=500 kPa, Tsat=26.69°C, v_g=0.04159 m³/kg. Wait, that's the same as our v1.

Wait, hold on. At 500 kPa, the saturated vapor specific volume is 0.04159 m³/kg, which matches our v1. Wait, but the initial state was superheated vapor at 500 kPa, 50°C. So, when we heat it, maybe the pressure will stay the same? Or perhaps not. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Because when you add heat to a closed system, depending on the circumstances, pressure can change. Since the vessel is rigid and the process is heating, the pressure will increase until the Freon becomes saturated vapor. Wait, but if the initial state is already at 500 kPa, but it's superheated, then when you heat it, perhaps the pressure increases beyond 500 kPa until it becomes saturated vapor again at a higher pressure.

Wait, no. Let me try to clarify:

The process starts at State 1: 500 kPa, 50°C (superheated vapor).

It is heated until it's fully saturated vapor. So, during heating, the pressure will rise because the volume is fixed, and temperature increases beyond 50°C. At some point, the temperature and pressure reach a point where the Freon is at the saturated vapor state. So, the final state is at a higher pressure where v_g = v1.

Wait, but v1 is the specific volume at State 1. So, State 2 has v2 = v1, because V is fixed and m is fixed. So, v2 = v1 = 0.04159 m³/kg.

Looking at the saturation table, v_g at 500 kPa is 0.04159 m³/kg. So, if I'm finding the state where v_g equals 0.04159, that's at 500 kPa. But that can't be right because that's the initial pressure. But the initial state was superheated vapor, not saturated.

Wait, so perhaps the final state is at 500 kPa, but as saturated vapor? But that's the same pressure as the initial state. That doesn't make sense because when you heat a gas at constant volume, the pressure would increase. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the process.

Alternatively, maybe the final state is at the same pressure but higher temperature, but that can't be because the vessel is rigid. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, let's try this again. The vessel is rigid, so volume doesn't change. So, when we heat the Freon, the pressure increases. The process continues until the Freon is a saturated vapor, which would be at a higher pressure. At this point, the specific volume is the same as the initial because V and m are the same, so v2 = v1. So, I need to find the pressure P2 where the saturated vapor specific volume v_g equals v1 = 0.04159 m³/kg.

Wait, but looking at the saturation table, at 500 kPa, v_g is exactly 0.04159 m³/kg. So, that would imply that the final pressure is 500 kPa. But that's the same as the initial pressure, which doesn't make sense because heating at constant volume should raise the pressure.

Hmm, now I'm getting stuck. Maybe I made a mistake in identifying the initial specific volume. Let me re-examine that.

Wait, initial state: 500 kPa, 50°C. From the superheated tables, what's the specific volume there. I thought it was 0.04159 m³/kg, but perhaps that's actually the saturated vapor value at 500 kPa. Let me check.

Wait, no. The saturated vapor specific volume at 500 kPa is 0.04159 m³/kg. So, if the initial state is superheated vapor at 500 kPa and 50°C, the specific volume would be higher than v_g. Wait, no, because at higher temperatures, the specific volume increases for superheated vapor. So, wait, at 500 kPa, 50°C, what's v?

Looking up the table: At 500 kPa, the saturation temperature is 26.69°C. So, at 50°C, which is higher, it's superheated. So, looking up the superheated table for 500 kPa, 50°C. What's the specific volume?

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. If at 500 kPa, 50°C, the specific volume is higher than v_g. Because superheated vapor at same pressure has higher specific volume than saturated vapor.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. At a given pressure, as temperature increases beyond the saturation point, the specific volume increases. So, v1 is higher than v_g at 500 kPa.

Wait, but earlier I thought that v1 was 0.04159, which is the v_g at 500 kPa. That can't be right because the initial state is superheated. So perhaps I need to correct this.

Let me get the correct specific volume at 500 kPa and 50°C. Let's say from the superheated table, at 500 kPa (500 kPa = 5 bar), 50°C, the specific volume v1 is approximately 0.043 m³/kg. Hmm, okay, so v1 is 0.043 m³/kg.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look up exact values. Alternatively, perhaps I can proceed with the correct approach, even if the numbers are estimates.

So, initial specific volume v1 is higher than v_g at 500 kPa because it's superheated. Then, when heated at constant volume, the pressure increases until it reaches a state where the specific volume equals v1, but as saturated vapor. Wait, no, because during heating, the pressure increases, so the saturated vapor specific volume at that higher pressure would be lower.

Wait, no, perhaps I should find the pressure P2 where v_g(P2) = v1. Because in the final state, the Freon is saturated vapor, so its specific volume is v_g at P2. But since the vessel's volume is fixed, v2 = V/m = v1.

So, v_g(P2) = v1.

Therefore, I need to find the pressure P2 where the saturated vapor specific volume v_g equals v1, which is the specific volume at the initial state.

So, let's say I have v1 = 0.043 m³/kg. Now, I look into the saturation table for Freon-12 and find the pressure where v_g is 0.043.

Looking at the table:

At P = 400 kPa, v_g ≈ 0.0542 m³/kg.

At P = 500 kPa, v_g = 0.04159.

Wait, so v_g decreases as pressure increases. So, if v1 is 0.043, which is between v_g at 500 kPa and 600 kPa?

Wait, no, wait. Let's look again.

Wait, at 500 kPa, v_g is 0.04159.

At 600 kPa, v_g is 0.0393.

Wait, so higher pressure means lower v_g.

But if v1 is 0.043, which is higher than v_g at 500 kPa, then the pressure P2 must be lower than 500 kPa. Because at lower pressures, v_g is higher.

Wait, but the initial pressure was 500 kPa. So, when you heat it, the pressure would increase, not decrease. Hmm, this seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing something up. The initial state is superheated vapor at 500 kPa. When you heat it at constant volume, the pressure increases because temperature increases. So, the final state must be at a higher pressure than 500 kPa, but as a saturated vapor. So, the specific volume in the final state is v_g at that higher pressure, which must be equal to v1.

Wait, but higher pressure implies lower v_g. So, if v1 is higher than v_g at 500 kPa, then to have v_g = v1, the pressure would have to be lower than 500 kPa, which can't be the case because heating at constant volume increases pressure.

This is getting confusing. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let's think about the process.

The vessel is rigid, so V is constant. Initially, it's at 500 kPa, 50°C (superheated). Then, heat is added until it becomes saturated vapor. So, the final state is saturated vapor at a higher pressure.

Wait, but the specific volume in the final state is v_g at P2, which must be equal to the initial specific volume v1, because V = m*v, and V and m are constant. So, v2 = v1.

So, to find P2, we look for where v_g = v1.

But if v1 is higher than v_g at 500 kPa, then P2 must be less than 500 kPa. But that would imply that the pressure decreased, which can't be because heating at constant volume increases pressure.

Hmm, this suggests that my initial assumption that v1 is higher than v_g at 500 kPa is incorrect. So perhaps I have to reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining v1. Let me recheck. At 500 kPa and 50°C, what's the specific volume v1?

Looking at the superheated table for Freon-12 at 500 kPa:

At 500 kPa (500 kPa = 5 bar), temperatures above 26.69°C are superheated.

So, at 50°C, v1 = 0.043 m³/kg? Or perhaps 0.04159 is correct because that's the v_g at 500 kPa, but that can't be, because at 50°C it's superheated, so v should be higher.

Wait, no, let me clarify. The specific volume of saturated vapor at 500 kPa is v_g = 0.04159 m³/kg. So, if the initial state is superheated at 500 kPa and 50°C, the specific volume v1 must be greater than 0.04159.

So, v1 is higher than 0.04159. So, when you heat the Freon, the pressure increases, and the specific volume when it becomes saturated vapor (v2 = v_g at P2) must equal v1, which is higher than v_g at 500 kPa. But as pressure increases, v_g decreases, so v_g at P2 would be lower than at 500 kPa. Therefore, v2 would be lower than 0.04159, but v1 is higher than that. So, this doesn't add up. There's a contradiction here.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the process is isobaric instead? No, the vessel is rigid, so it's not isobaric. Alternatively, maybe I should use the ideal gas law for the initial state.

Wait, assuming Freon behaves as an ideal gas, which might not be the case, but let's try. The ideal gas law is Pv = RT. So, v1 = RT/P.

At State 1, P1 = 500 kPa = 500,000 Pa, T1 = 50°C = 323.15 K.

R for Freon-12 is 34.4 J/kg·K.

So, v1 = (34.4 * 323.15) / 500,000 = (11078.16) / 500,000 ≈ 0.02216 m³/kg.

Wait, that can't be right because that would imply a much lower specific volume than the saturated vapor at 500 kPa, which is 0.04159 m³/kg. So, that suggests that using ideal gas assumption is incorrect here. Because Freon-12 doesn't behave ideally at these conditions.

So, I have to use the actual specific volume from the tables. So, back to the tables.

At 500
