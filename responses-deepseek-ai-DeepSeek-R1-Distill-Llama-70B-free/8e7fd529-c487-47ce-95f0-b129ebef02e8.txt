Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a ball being thrown upward. Hmm, let's see. The question has three parts: a, b, and c. I'll need to tackle each one, but maybe starting with part a since it's the first step.

Part (a) asks, what speed must the ball be thrown upward to stay in the air for 10 seconds. Wait, I remember that when you throw something straight up, its time in the air is determined by its initial velocity and gravity. Oh right, the time to reach the peak is when the velocity becomes zero. So the total time up and down would be twice that time.

So, the time to reach the maximum height is half of the total time. Since the total time is 10 seconds, each way (up and down) takes 5 seconds. So, using the equation for velocity under constant acceleration. The formula I think is v = u + at. At the peak, the final velocity v is 0. The acceleration a is gravity, which is -32 ft/s² (negative because it's acting downward).

So, 0 = u + (-32)*t. Wait, t here is the time to reach the peak, which is 5 seconds. So rearranging for u: u = 32 * 5. 32 times 5 is 160 ft/s. So the initial velocity must be 160 ft/sec upwards.

Looking at the options, option B says 160 ft/sec for part a. That makes sense. Let me double-check. If you throw it at 160 ft/s upward, it would take 5 seconds to reach the top, then 5 seconds to come back down, totaling 10 seconds in the air. Yep, that checks out.

Moving on to part (b): What's the speed when it hits the ground? Hmm. When the ball is thrown upward and comes back down, the speed when it hits the ground should be the same magnitude as when it was thrown but in the opposite direction because of the symmetry (assuming no air resistance). So if it was thrown at 160 ft/s up, it should come down at 160 ft/s down. So the speed is -160 ft/sec. Let me think if that's correct.

Alternatively, I can use the kinematic equation: v² = u² + 2as. Here, the displacement s is zero because it starts and ends at the same height. So 0 = u² + 2*(-32)*0? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. The displacement when it returns to the ground is zero. So initial velocity is 160 upwards, final velocity is what?

Alternatively, the equation can be written as v = u + at. The time here is 10 seconds, because the total time in the air is 10 seconds. So v = 160 + (-32)(10). Let me calculate that. 32*10 is 320, so 160 - 320 is -160 ft/s. Yep, so the final velocity is -160 ft/s. So part (b) is -160. Looking at the options, option B has (b) -160. So that's correct.

Now part (c): How high does the ball rise? To find the maximum height, I can use the formula for maximum height when initial velocity is known. The formula is (u²)/(2g), because at the peak, all kinetic energy is converted to potential energy. So u is 160 ft/s, g is 32 ft/s².

So (160)^2 / (2*32) = (25600)/(64) = 400 ft. So the maximum height is 400 feet. Checking the options, option B says (c) 400 ft. So that fits too.

So all three parts point to option B being the correct answer. Let me just make sure I didn't mix any numbers. Oh, wait, the possible answers: option B is (a) 160, (b) -160, (c)400. Yep, all correct.

To solve the problem, we analyze each part systematically:

**(a) Speed required to keep the ball in the air for 10 seconds:**  
When a ball is thrown straight upward, the total time in the air is determined by its initial velocity and gravity. The time to reach the peak is half the total time, so for 10 seconds, the ball takes 5 seconds to ascend and 5 seconds to descend. Using the kinematic equation \( v = u + at \), where \( v = 0 \) at the peak, \( a = -32 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \) (gravity), and \( t = 5 \, \text{s} \), we solve for \( u \):  
\[
0 = u - 32 \cdot 5 \implies u = 160 \, \text{ft/s}.
\]  
Thus, the ball must be thrown upward at \( 160 \, \text{ft/s} \).

**(b) Speed when the ball hits the ground:**  
When the ball returns to the ground, its speed will have the same magnitude as the initial velocity but in the opposite direction (assuming no air resistance). Using the kinematic equation \( v = u + at \), where \( u = 160 \, \text{ft/s} \), \( a = -32 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \), and \( t = 10 \, \text{s} \):  
\[
v = 160 - 32 \cdot 10 = 160 - 320 = -160 \, \text{ft/s}.
\]  
The speed when it hits the ground is \( -160 \, \text{ft/s} \).

**(c) Maximum height the ball rises:**  
The maximum height can be calculated using the formula \( h = \frac{u^2}{2g} \), where \( u = 160 \, \text{ft/s} \) and \( g = 32 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \):  
\[
h = \frac{160^2}{2 \cdot 32} = \frac{25600}{64} = 400 \, \text{ft}.
\]  
The ball rises to a height of \( 400 \, \text{ft} \).

From the given options, the correct answer is **B**:  
(a) \( 160 \, \text{ft/s} \), (b) \( -160 \, \text{ft/s} \), (c) \( 400 \, \text{ft} \).
