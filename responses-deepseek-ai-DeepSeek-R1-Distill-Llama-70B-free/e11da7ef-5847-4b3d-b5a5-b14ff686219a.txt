Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about finding the sum of three real numbers that are not in the domain of the function f(x). The function given is f(x) = 1/(1 + 1/(1 + 1/x)). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated with all the fractions nested inside each other.

Alright, so the domain of a function includes all the real numbers x for which the function is defined. Since this function has a lot of denominators, I need to make sure that none of them are zero because division by zero is undefined. So, I should find all the values of x that make any of the denominators zero and exclude them from the domain. Then, sum those excluded x values.

Let me break down the function step by step. The function f(x) is a complex fraction. Let me rewrite it for clarity:

f(x) = 1 / [1 + (1 / (1 + (1/x))) ]

Wait, maybe I should simplify this step by step. Let's start from the innermost part and work our way out.

The innermost part is 1/x. So, the first thing to note is that x cannot be zero because 1/x would be undefined. So, x=0 is definitely not in the domain. That's one of the three numbers we're looking for.

Next, let's look at the next layer: 1 + 1/x. So, the denominator here is 1 + (1/x). Wait, no, actually, the structure is f(x) = 1 divided by [1 + (1 divided by (1 + (1/x)))]. So, the denominators are:

1. x (in 1/x)
2. 1 + 1/x (in the denominator of the middle fraction)
3. 1 + [1/(1 + 1/x)] (the outer denominator)

So, each denominator must not be zero.

Let me tackle each denominator one by one.

First denominator: x. So, x cannot be zero. Got that.

Second denominator: 1 + 1/x. So, 1 + (1/x) can't be zero. Let's set that equal to zero and solve for x.

1 + (1/x) = 0
=> 1/x = -1
=> x = -1

So, x cannot be -1, because that would make the second denominator zero. So that's the second number, x = -1.

Third denominator: 1 + [1/(1 + 1/x)]. Let's call this D for short. So, D = 1 + [1/(1 + 1/x)].

Wait, so D is the denominator of the entire function. So, D can't be zero either. Let's write an equation where D equals zero and solve for x.

So,

1 + [1/(1 + 1/x)] = 0

Hmm, let's solve this. Let me simplify this expression.

Let me denote A = 1 + 1/x. Then, the equation becomes 1 + (1/A) = 0.

So,

1 + (1/A) = 0
=> 1/A = -1
=> A = -1

But A is 1 + 1/x, so:

1 + (1/x) = -1
=> 1/x = -2
=> x = -1/2

So, x cannot be -1/2 because that would make the third denominator zero. That's the third number, x = -1/2.

Wait, so the three excluded x values are x = 0, x = -1, and x = -1/2. So, their sum is 0 + (-1) + (-0.5) = -1.5.

Wait, but let me double-check these calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Let me go through each denominator again.

First, x can't be zero, correct.

Second, 1 + 1/x = 0 → x = -1. Correct.

Third, 1 + [1/(1 +1/x)] = 0.

Let me re-solve that step.

Set D = 1 + [1/(1 +1/x)] = 0.

Compute 1 + [1/(1+1/x)] = 0.

Let me compute 1/(1+1/x) first. Let me call that term B.

B = 1/(1 + 1/x) = 1/( (x +1)/x ) ) = x/(x+1), provided that x +1 ≠ 0 and x ≠0.

So, substituting back into D: D = 1 + B = 1 + x/(x+1).

So, D = [ (x+1) + x ] / (x+1 ) = (2x +1)/(x+1).

Set D = 0: (2x +1)/(x+1) = 0.

A fraction is zero when the numerator is zero (and denominator isn't). So, 2x +1 = 0 → x = -1/2.

But we also need to ensure that x+1 ≠0, which means x ≠ -1. But we're already excluding x=-1, so that's okay.

So, yes, x=-1/2 is the third excluded value.

So, the three x values not in the domain are 0, -1, and -1/2.

Adding them up: 0 + (-1) + (-0.5) = -1.5.

Looking at the options, option C is -1.5. So, the answer should be C.

To determine the sum of the three real numbers not in the domain of the function 

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{x}}},$$

we need to identify the values of \(x\) that make any denominator in the function equal to zero, as division by zero is undefined. The function has three denominators:

1. **Innermost denominator**: \(x\). For \(1/x\) to be defined, \(x \neq 0\). Thus, \(x = 0\) is excluded.

2. **Middle denominator**: \(1 + \frac{1}{x}\). Setting \(1 + \frac{1}{x} = 0\), we solve:
   \[
   1 + \frac{1}{x} = 0 \implies \frac{1}{x} = -1 \implies x = -1.
   \]
   Thus, \(x = -1\) is excluded.

3. **Outer denominator**: \(1 + \frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{x}}\). Let \(A = 1 + \frac{1}{x}\). Then the denominator becomes \(1 + \frac{1}{A}\). Setting \(1 + \frac{1}{A} = 0\), we solve:
   \[
   1 + \frac{1}{A} = 0 \implies \frac{1}{A} = -1 \implies A = -1.
   \]
   Substituting \(A = 1 + \frac{1}{x}\), we get:
   \[
   1 + \frac{1}{x} = -1 \implies \frac{1}{x} = -2 \implies x = -\frac{1}{2}.
   \]
   Thus, \(x = -\frac{1}{2}\) is excluded.

The three values excluded from the domain are \(x = 0\), \(x = -1\), and \(x = -\frac{1}{2}\). Their sum is:

\[
0 + (-1) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = -1.5.
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**C: -1.5**
