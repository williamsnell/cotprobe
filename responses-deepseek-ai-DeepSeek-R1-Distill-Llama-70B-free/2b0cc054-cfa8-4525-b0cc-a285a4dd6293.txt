Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the current through a capacitor at time t=0 for three different voltage scenarios. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my circuit analysis, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the current in a capacitor is related to the voltage across it. The formula I think is i = C * dv/dt, where C is capacitance and dv/dt is the derivative of the voltage with respect to time. Oh right, because the current is the capacitance multiplied by the rate of change of voltage.

The capacitor given is 0.01 microfarads. Oh wait, micro is 10^-6, so 0.01 microfarads is 0.01e-6 farads, which is 1e-8 F. Got that.

Now, there are three parts: (a), (b), and (c). I'll tackle them one by one.

Starting with part (a): The voltage is 2 sin(2π * 10^6 t) volts. So I need to find the derivative of this voltage with respect to time and then multiply by the capacitance to get the current at t=0.

The derivative of sin(ωt) with respect to t is ω cos(ωt). So here, ω is 2π*10^6. So dv/dt = 2 * (2π*10^6) cos(2π*10^6 t). 

At t=0, cos(0) is 1. So dv/dt at t=0 is 2 * 2π*10^6 *1 = 4π*10^6 V/s.

Then the current i = C * dv/dt = 1e-8 F *4π*1e6 V/s. Let's calculate that: 1e-8 *4e6 is 4e-2, and π is about 3.1416, so 4e-2 *3.1416 = approximately 0.12566 A. So about 0.1256 A.

Wait, but looking at the options, some have 0.1256 as the first value. So that's part (a) done.

Moving on to part (b): The voltage is -2e^(-10^7 t) volts. Wait, wait, is it 10^7? Because in the problem statement, for parts (b) and (c), it's written as -2e-(10)7 t V. Oh, I think that's a typo or formatting issue. Probably, it's -2e^(-10^7 t). So exponent is negative 10^7 times t.

So I need to find the derivative of v with respect to t again.

v(t) = -2 e^(-10^7 t). So dv/dt is the derivative of that. The derivative of e^(kt) is k e^(kt). So here, k is -10^7.

So dv/dt = -2 * (-10^7) e^(-10^7 t) = 2 * 10^7 e^(-10^7 t).

At t=0, e^0 is 1. So dv/dt = 2e7 *1 = 2e7 V/s.

Then current i = C * dv/dt = 1e-8 F * 2e7 V/s. Let me calculate that: 1e-8 * 2e7 = (1e-8)*(2e7) = 2e-1 = 0.2 A.

So part (b)'s current is 0.2 A.

Wait, but I should double-check the signs. The original voltage is negative, but the derivative is positive 2e7 because the negative times the negative 10^7 gives positive. So the current is positive 0.2 A.

Now part (c): The voltage is -2e^(-10^7 t) sin(2π 10^6 t) V. So this is a product of an exponential and a sine function. To find dv/dt, I'll need to use the product rule.

The product rule states that the derivative of u*v is u'v + uv'.

Let me set u = -2 e^(-10^7 t), so du/dt = (-2)(-10^7) e^(-10^7 t) )= 20,000,000 e^(-10^7 t).

Wait, wait, let's compute it correctly. The derivative of u with respect to t: u = -2 e^(-a t), where a =1e7.

du/dt = (-2) * (-a) e^(-a t) )= 2a e^(-a t) )= 2e7 e^(-1e7 t).

And v = sin(2π1e6 t). So dv/dt = 2π1e6 cos(2π1e6 t).

So putting it all together, dv/dt = u' v + u v'

At t=0, let's compute each part.

u at t=0: -2 e^0 = -2 *1 = -2.

v at t=0: sin(0) = 0.

u' at t=0: 2e7 e^0 = 2e7 *1 = 2e7.

v' at t=0: 2πe6 cos(0) = 2πe6 *1 = 2πe6.

So now, the derivative at t=0 is:

u'(0)*v(0) + u(0)*v'(0) )

= (2e7)(0) + (-2)(2πe6) )

= 0 + (-4 π e6 )

So dv/dt at t=0 is -4 π 1e6 V/s.

Then current i = C * dv/dt = 1e-8 F * (-4πe6) V/s.

Calculating that: 1e-8 * (-4e6 π) = (-4e-2) * π = approximately -0.12566 A.

Wait, but let me compute that more accurately.

4e6 is 4,000,000. 1e-8 *4e6 = (1e-8)*(4e6) = 4e-2 = 0.04.

Wait wait, wait, wait. Wait, 1e-8 multiplied by 4e6 is (1e-8)*(4e6) = 4e-2 = 0.04. So 0.04 times π is about 0.1256. So 0.04 * π is 0.1256637... So with the negative sign, it's about -0.1256 A.

So the current for part (c) is approximately -0.1256 A.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see.

Our three results are:

a) ~0.1256 A

b) 0.2 A

c) ~-0.1256 A

Now, looking at the options, I need to find which option has these three values.

Looking through the options:

Option A: 0.1256, 0.2, 0.1256. Hmm, but part (c) is negative, so no.

Option B: 0.1256, 0.3, 0.1256. No, because (b) is 0.2, not 0.3.

Option C: 0.2345, 0.1, -0.4567. No.

Option D: 0.2, 0.1, 0.2. No.

Option E: 0, 0.1, 0. No.

Option F: 0.1256, 0.2, -0.1256. Oh wait, that looks right.

Wait, option F is (a)=0.1256, (b)=0.2, (c)= -0.1256. So that's exactly what we've calculated. So the correct answer should be option F.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck part (b). Oh, because in part (b), the current was 0.2 A. So yes, the options in F match.

So the correct option is F.

To determine the current through the capacitor at \( t = 0 \) for the given voltage scenarios, we use the formula for current in a capacitor:

\[
i = C \frac{dv}{dt}
\]

where \( C = 0.01 \, \mu\text{F} = 1 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{F} \). The voltage expressions are differentiated with respect to time, and the derivatives are evaluated at \( t = 0 \). The results for each part are as follows:

---

### (a) \( v(t) = 2 \sin(2\pi 10^6 t) \, \text{V} \)

The derivative of \( v(t) \) is:

\[
\frac{dv}{dt} = 2 \cdot (2\pi 10^6) \cos(2\pi 10^6 t)
\]

At \( t = 0 \), \( \cos(0) = 1 \), so:

\[
\frac{dv}{dt} \bigg|_{t=0} = 4\pi 10^6 \, \text{V/s}
\]

The current is:

\[
i = C \frac{dv}{dt} = (1 \times 10^{-8}) \cdot (4\pi 10^6) = 0.12566 \, \text{A}
\]

Thus, \( i \approx 0.1256 \, \text{A} \).

---

### (b) \( v(t) = -2e^{-(10^7)t} \, \text{V} \)

The derivative of \( v(t) \) is:

\[
\frac{dv}{dt} = -2 \cdot (-10^7) e^{-(10^7)t} = 2 \cdot 10^7 e^{-(10^7)t}
\]

At \( t = 0 \), \( e^0 = 1 \), so:

\[
\frac{dv}{dt} \bigg|_{t=0} = 2 \cdot 10^7 \, \text{V/s}
\]

The current is:

\[
i = C \frac{dv}{dt} = (1 \times 10^{-8}) \cdot (2 \cdot 10^7) = 0.2 \, \text{A}
\]

Thus, \( i = 0.2 \, \text{A} \).

---

### (c) \( v(t) = -2e^{-(10^7)t} \sin(2\pi 10^6 t) \, \text{V} \)

Using the product rule, the derivative of \( v(t) \) is:

\[
\frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}[-2e^{-(10^7)t}] \cdot \sin(2\pi 10^6 t) + (-2e^{-(10^7)t}) \cdot \frac{d}{dt}[\sin(2\pi 10^6 t)]
\]

1. \( \frac{d}{dt}[-2e^{-(10^7)t}] = 2 \cdot 10^7 e^{-(10^7)t} \)
2. \( \frac{d}{dt}[\sin(2\pi 10^6 t)] = 2\pi 10^6 \cos(2\pi 10^6 t) \)

At \( t = 0 \):

- \( e^0 = 1 \), \( \sin(0) = 0 \), and \( \cos(0) = 1 \)

Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{dv}{dt} \bigg|_{t=0} = (2 \cdot 10^7 \cdot 1) \cdot 0 + (-2 \cdot 1) \cdot (2\pi 10^6 \cdot 1) = -4\pi 10^6 \, \text{V/s}
\]

The current is:

\[
i = C \frac{dv}{dt} = (1 \times 10^{-8}) \cdot (-4\pi 10^6) = -0.12566 \, \text{A}
\]

Thus, \( i \approx -0.1256 \, \text{A} \).

---

### Final Results

- (a) \( i \approx 0.1256 \, \text{A} \)
- (b) \( i = 0.2 \, \text{A} \)
- (c) \( i \approx -0.1256 \, \text{A} \)

Comparing these results with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**Option F: 0.1256 A, 0.2 A, -0.1256 A**

F
