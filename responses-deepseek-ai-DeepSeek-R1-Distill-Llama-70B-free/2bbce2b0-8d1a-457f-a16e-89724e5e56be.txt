Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the specific heat of brass. Hmm, specific heat is the amount of heat per unit mass required to raise the temperature by one degree Celsius or Kelvin, right? Oh wait, but the units here are in Fahrenheit and pounds, so I need to make sure I handle the units correctly.

Alright, let's read the problem again. We have 2.00 pounds of brass at 2120°F dropped into 5.00 pounds of water at 35.00°F. The resulting temperature is 41.2°F. I need to find the specific heat of the brass. Oh, and I should neglect the effect of the container, so no heat loss to the surroundings.

Wait, I remember that when two substances exchange heat, the heat lost by the hotter one equals the heat gained by the cooler one. But wait, wait, I think it's heat lost by the hotter equals heat gained by the cooler. So in this case, the brass is hotter than the water, so the brass will lose heat, and the water will gain heat. But wait, wait, the initial temps: brass is at 212°F, water at 35°F. After mixing, it's 41.2°F. So yeah, the brass cools down, water heats up.

So the formula I think is: mass of brass * specific heat of brass * (initial temp of brass - final temp) equals mass of water * specific heat of water * (final temp - initial temp of water).

Wait, but I need to be careful with the temperatures. Because the change in temperature for brass is higher than for water. Let me note down the variables.

Given:
Mass of brass (m_b) = 2.00 lb
Initial temp of brass (T_b_initial) = 212.0°F
Mass of water (m_w) = 5.00 lb
Initial temp of water (T_w_initial) = 35.00°F
Final temp (T_f) = 41.2°F

We need to find the specific heat of brass (s_b). The specific heat of water (s_w) is a known value. I think it's around 1 Btu/lb°F, right? Because I remember that water has a specific heat of 1 calorie per gram per degree Celsius, but we're using Btu here. Oh wait, 1 Btu is about 778 foot-pounds, but for specific heat, water is 1 Btu/lb°F. So I'll use 1.0 Btu/lb°F for water.

So the heat lost by brass (Q_b) equals the heat gained by water (Q_w). So Q_b = Q_w.

Q_b = m_b * s_b * (T_b_initial - T_f)
Q_w = m_w * s_w * (T_f - T_w_initial)

So setting them equal: m_b * s_b * (T_b_initial - T_f) = m_w * s_w * (T_f - T_w_initial)

I can solve for s_b:

s_b = [m_w * s_w * (T_f - T_w_initial)] / [m_b * (T_b_initial - T_f)]

Plugging in the numbers:

m_w = 5.00 lb
s_w = 1.0 Btu/lb°F
T_f = 41.2°F
T_w_initial = 35.00°F
m_b = 2.00 lb
T_b_initial = 212.0°F

Calculating numerator: 5.00 * 1.0 * (41.2 - 35.00) = 5 * (6.2) = 31.0

Denominator: 2.00 * (212.0 - 41.2) = 2 * 170.8 = 341.6

So s_b = 31.0 / 341.6 ≈ let's calculate that.

Hmm, 31 divided by 341.6. Let me compute that. Let's see:

341.6 is approximately 340. 31/340 is about 0.091. More accurately:

341.6 * 0.09 = 30.744. That's close to 31.

Wait, 0.09 * 341.6 = 30.744. So 31 is a bit higher. 30.744 is 0.09, so 31-30.744=0.256.

0.256 / 341.6 ≈ approx 0.00075. So total is 0.09075, approximately 0.0908. So around 0.091 Btu/lb°F.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.091. Let me check the options:

Option C: 0.091 Btu/lbF0 — I think that's a typo, probably supposed to be °F. So the correct answer would be C.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation. Maybe I made a mistake in the math.

Compute numerator: 5 * (41.2 -35) = 5 *6.2=31.

Denominator: 2*(212-41.2)=2*(170.8)=341.6.

31 / 341.6 = ?

Let me compute it step by step.

31 ÷ 341.6.

Well, 341.6 × 0.09 = 30.744.

31 - 30.744 = 0.256.

Now 0.256 / 341.6 = 0.0007485.

So total is 0.09 + 0.0007485 = 0.0907485 ≈ 0.0907.

So approximately 0.091, which matches option C.

So the correct answer would be option C: 0.091 Btu/lb°F.

To determine the specific heat of brass, we use the principle of conservation of energy: the heat lost by the brass equals the heat gained by the water. The formula is:

\[
Q_b = Q_w
\]

where:
- \( Q_b = m_b \cdot s_b \cdot (T_{b,\text{initial}} - T_f) \) (heat lost by brass),
- \( Q_w = m_w \cdot s_w \cdot (T_f - T_{w,\text{initial}}) \) (heat gained by water).

Rearranging for \( s_b \), the specific heat of brass:

\[
s_b = \frac{m_w \cdot s_w \cdot (T_f - T_{w,\text{initial}})}{m_b \cdot (T_{b,\text{initial}} - T_f)}
\]

Given:
- \( m_b = 2.00 \, \text{lb} \),
- \( T_{b,\text{initial}} = 212.0 \, ^\circ\text{F} \),
- \( m_w = 5.00 \, \text{lb} \),
- \( T_{w,\text{initial}} = 35.00 \, ^\circ\text{F} \),
- \( T_f = 41.2 \, ^\circ\text{F} \),
- \( s_w = 1.0 \, \text{Btu/lb} \cdot ^\circ\text{F} \) (specific heat of water).

Substituting the values:

\[
s_b = \frac{5.00 \cdot 1.0 \cdot (41.2 - 35.00)}{2.00 \cdot (212.0 - 41.2)}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
5.00 \cdot 1.0 \cdot (41.2 - 35.00) = 5.00 \cdot 6.2 = 31.0
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
2.00 \cdot (212.0 - 41.2) = 2.00 \cdot 170.8 = 341.6
\]

Now, divide:

\[
s_b = \frac{31.0}{341.6} \approx 0.0907 \, \text{Btu/lb} \cdot ^\circ\text{F}
\]

This rounds to \( 0.091 \, \text{Btu/lb} \cdot ^\circ\text{F} \), which matches option C.
