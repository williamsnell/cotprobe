Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to find the frequency of oscillatory motion for a system of two masses connected by a spring on a frictionless track. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, the problem states that there are two masses, m1 is 100 grams and m2 is 200 grams. They're sliding on a horizontal, frictionless track connected by a spring with a force constant k of 0.5 N/m. I need to find the frequency of their oscillations.

Wait, I remember that when two masses are connected by a spring, the system oscillates with a certain frequency. But I think each mass doesn't oscillate independently; instead, the system as a whole has a reduced mass that determines the frequency. Oh right, the concept of reduced mass comes into play here.

So the formula for the frequency of a two-body oscillator is similar to the simple harmonic oscillator, but using the reduced mass of the system. The formula for frequency f is (1/(2π)) times the square root of (k divided by μ), where μ is the reduced mass.

The reduced mass μ is given by (m1 * m2) / (m1 + m2). Right, because when the masses are connected by a spring, the effective mass that the spring "feels" is this reduced mass.

Let me plug in the numbers. First, I'll convert the masses to kilograms since the standard unit for mass in physics is kg. So m1 is 100 grams, which is 0.1 kg. m2 is 200 grams, so 0.2 kg.

Calculating the reduced mass μ: (0.1 kg * 0.2 kg) / (0.1 + 0.2) kg. Let me compute that. 0.1 * 0.2 is 0.02. The denominator is 0.3 kg. So μ = 0.02 / 0.3, which is approximately 0.066666... kg. Hmm, that's 1/15 kg.

Wait, 0.02 divided by 0.3. Let me double-check that: 0.3 goes into 0.02 how many times? 0.3 * 0.066666 is 0.02. So yes, μ is 0.066666 kg.

Now, the angular frequency ω is the square root of (k/μ). K is 0.5 N/m. So let's plug that in: ω = sqrt(0.5 / 0.066666). Let me compute 0.5 divided by (1/15). Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so 0.5 * 15 equals 7.5. So ω is sqrt(7.5).

What's the square root of 7.5? Let me think. 7.5 is 15/2, so sqrt(15/2) is sqrt(7.5). Well, sqrt(9) is 3, sqrt(6.25)=2.5, sqrt(7.5) is somewhere around 2.7386, because 2.7386 squared is approximately 7.5.

So ω is approximately 2.7386 rad/s. Wait, but what's the question asking? It's asking for the frequency, not the angular frequency. Oh wait no, in the options, the choices are in rad/s, which is angular frequency. Oh wait, no, wait, the question says "find the frequency of oscillatory motion", which usually refers to the regular frequency f, measured in Hz (which is 1/s). But the options are given in rad/s; that suggests that the question is actually asking for the angular frequency, omega.

Wait, the question says "frequency of oscillatory motion". So perhaps I should double-check. Because sometimes, people might refer to f as the frequency, and ω as angular frequency. So in that case, the formula would be f = ω/(2π), and the units would be Hz.

Wait, but looking at the options, they're all in rad/s, which is the unit for angular frequency (omega). So perhaps the question is actually asking for the angular frequency, not the regular frequency. Or maybe it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the question is correct in asking for frequency but the options are in terms of omega.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me read the question again. It says, "Find the frequency of oscillatory motion for this system." The options are all in rad/s, which is the unit for angular frequency, not regular frequency (which is Hz, 1/s). So perhaps the question is incorrectly wording it, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, but in physics, sometimes "frequency" is used to mean angular frequency, especially in equations like ω = 2πf, where ω is the angular frequency and f is the regular frequency. So perhaps the question is using "frequency" in the sense of angular frequency. Alternatively, perhaps it's a mistake, and the correct term is angular frequency.

But looking at the answer options, they all have units of rad/s, so I think the intended answer is the angular frequency. So I'll proceed with that.

So I calculated ω as approximately 2.7386 rad/s. Looking at the options, option H is 2.74 rad/s, which is very close to what I calculated. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any errors in calculation. Let me redo the steps.

Masses: m1 = 0.1 kg, m2 = 0.2 kg.

Reduced mass μ = (0.1 * 0.2)/(0.1 + 0.2) = 0.02 / 0.3 = 0.066666 kg.

k is 0.5 N/m.

ω = sqrt(k/μ) = sqrt(0.5 / 0.066666) = sqrt(7.5) ≈ 2.7386 rad/s.

Yes, that's correct. So the closest option is H: 2.74 rad/s.

To determine the angular frequency of oscillatory motion for the system, we use the formula:

\[
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{\mu}}
\]

where \( \mu \) is the reduced mass of the system, given by:

\[
\mu = \frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2}
\]

### Step 1: Convert masses to kilograms
The masses are given as \( m_1 = 100 \, \mathrm{g} = 0.1 \, \mathrm{kg} \) and \( m_2 = 200 \, \mathrm{g} = 0.2 \, \mathrm{kg} \).

### Step 2: Calculate the reduced mass
\[
\mu = \frac{(0.1)(0.2)}{0.1 + 0.2} = \frac{0.02}{0.3} \approx 0.066666 \, \mathrm{kg}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the angular frequency
The spring constant is \( k = 0.5 \, \mathrm{N/m} \). Substituting into the formula for \( \omega \):

\[
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{\mu}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.5}{0.066666}} = \sqrt{7.5} \approx 2.7386 \, \mathrm{rad/s}
\]

### Step 4: Match the closest option
The calculated angular frequency \( \omega \approx 2.74 \, \mathrm{rad/s} \) matches option **H**.
