Question:

Wilshire Street is a public thoroughfare, designated as a one-way street for northbound traffic. Wilshire and Figueroa Streets intersect at right angles. The intersection is controlled by traffic lights. A businessman was driving his car east on Figueroa Street and did not see the traffic light. He entered the intersection at a time when the light was red for eastbound traffic and green for northbound traffic. A woman, in violation of statute, was proceeding south on Wilshire Street, and she entered the intersection without looking for any cross traffic and struck the businessman's car. The businessman suffered damages in the amount of $5,000. The woman, on the other hand, suffered damages in the amount of $1,000. The businessman brought suit against the woman to recover his damages. The woman denied liability and filed a counterclaim against the businessman for her damages. Both drivers were negligent with 30 percent of the negligence attributable to the woman and 70 percent of the negligence attributable to the businessman. A statute in the jurisdiction provides: "A failure to exercise ordinary care, which contributes to personal injury or property damage, shall not bar recovery of damages by the injured party, but damages shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the person injured. There shall be no set-off of damages between the respective parties. " Which of the following is the appropriate judgment in the case?

Options:

A: The businessman recovers $1,000 from the woman, and the woman recovers $900 from the businessman.
B: The businessman recovers $5,000 from the woman, and the woman recovers $1,000 from the businessman.
C: The businessman recovers $3,500 from the woman, and the woman recovers $300 from the businessman.
D: The businessman recovers $800 from the woman, and the woman recovers nothing from the businessman.
E: The businessman recovers $5,000 from the woman, and the woman recovers nothing from the businessman.
F: The businessman recovers nothing from the woman, and the woman recovers $1,000 from the businessman.
G: The businessman recovers $1,500 from the woman, and the woman recovers $700 from the businessman.
H: The businessman recovers $2,000 from the woman, and the woman recovers $500 from the businessman.
I: The businessman recovers $3,000 from the woman, and the woman recovers $600 from the businessman.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about tort law, specifically dealing with negligence and damages. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step.

First, let me read the question carefully. So, there's an intersection with traffic lights. Wilshire is a one-way street going northbound. Figueroa is another street they intersect at right angles. So, if someone is on Figueroa, they can go east or west, I guess.

The businessman was driving east on Figueroa and didn't see the traffic light. He entered the intersection when the light was red for eastbound traffic and green for northbound. So, the light was red for him, meaning he shouldn't have gone. That's negligence on his part because he didn't obey the traffic signal.

Then, the woman was going south on Wilshire, which is a one-way street for northbound traffic. So she was going the wrong way, which is a violation of statute. She entered without looking and hit the businessman's car. So she's also negligent because she's going the wrong direction and not looking.

Damages: businessman has $5k, woman has $1k. Both are suing each other.

Now, the key part is the statute in the jurisdiction. It says that if you fail to exercise ordinary care and it contributes to injury or damage, you can still recover damages, but the damages are diminished in proportion to your own negligence. Also, there's no set-off between the parties.

Wait, so this sounds like a modified comparative negligence system. So each party's recovery is reduced by their percentage of negligence. But no set-off, so their claims are separate.

The negligence is 30% attributable to the woman and 70% to the businessman.

So, the businessman is 70% at fault, the woman 30% at fault.

So the statute says that each party can recover from the other, but their damages are reduced by their own percentage of negligence. But wait, the statute says "the injured party" — so each is an injured party in their own claim.

Wait, no, the way the statute is phrased, each party's recovery is diminished by their own percentage. So when the businessman sues the woman, his recovery is reduced by his own 70% negligence. Similarly, when the woman sues him, her recovery is reduced by her 30% negligence.

Wait, but the statute says "the injured party" — does that refer to the plaintiff in each case? So, for example, when the businessman is the plaintiff suing the woman, his damages are reduced by his own 70% negligence. And when the woman is the plaintiff suing the businessman, her damages are reduced by her 30% negligence.

But the problem says that the statute does not allow any set-off between the parties. So their claims are treated separately, not offsetting each other's damages.

So let's compute each party's recovery.

Businessman's claim against the woman:
His total damage is $5k. But he is 70% at fault, so his recovery is diminished by 70%. So he can recover 30% of $5k. 30% of 5k is $1,500. So he gets $1,500 from the woman.

Woman's claim against the businessman:
Her total damage is $1k. She is 30% at fault, so her recovery is reduced by 30%. So she can recover 70% of $1k, which is $700.

But wait, the options don't have 1.5k and 0.7k. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Biz recovers 1k, woman 900. That doesn't match.

Option C: Biz 3.5k (70% of 5k?), Woman 300 (30% of 1k). Hmm, no.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the statute. Let me read it again.

"A failure to exercise ordinary care, which contributes to personal injury or property damage, shall not bar recovery of damages by the injured party, but damages shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the person injured. There shall be no set-off of damages between the respective parties."

Ah, so the injured party's damages are diminished by their own percentage of fault. So the plaintiff's recovery is reduced by their own percentage of negligence.

So in the businessman's case against the woman: he is the plaintiff, and his own negligence is 70%, so his recovery is 5k minus 70% of 5k, which is 1.5k.

In the woman's case against the businessman: she is the plaintiff, her own negligence is 30%, so her recovery is 1k minus 30% of 1k, which is 700.

So the total would be the businessman gets 1.5k from the woman, and the woman gets 700 from the businessman.

But looking at the options, none of them have 1.5k and 0.7k. Wait, let me look again.

Option G says businessman recovers 1.5k, woman 700. So that would be G.

Wait, let me read the options again:

Option G: The businessman recovers $1,500 from the woman, and the woman recovers $700 from the businessman.

Yes, that's what I calculated. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but wait a second. Some jurisdictions apply comparative negligence where the plaintiff's recovery is reduced by their percentage of fault, but if the plaintiff is more than 50% at fault, they can't recover. But in this case, the statute doesn't mention that; it's a pure comparative negligence approach because it says "diminished in proportion". So even if the plaintiff is 70% at fault, they can still recover 30% of their damages.

So yes, the calculation stands.

Looking at the options, G is the correct one. So the answer is G.

The question involves a car accident at an intersection where both drivers were negligent. The businessman was driving east on Figueroa Street and entered the intersection when the light was red for eastbound traffic, making him 70% at fault. The woman was driving south on Wilshire Street, which is a one-way street for northbound traffic, in violation of the law, making her 30% at fault. The businessman suffered $5,000 in damages, while the woman suffered $1,000 in damages.

The jurisdiction follows a modified comparative negligence system, where damages are diminished in proportion to the plaintiff's own negligence, and there is no set-off of damages between the parties. This means each party's recovery is reduced by their percentage of fault, but their claims are treated separately.

For the businessman's claim against the woman:
- The businessman's total damages are $5,000, but he is 70% at fault. His recovery is reduced by 70%, leaving him with 30% of $5,000, which is $1,500.

For the woman's claim against the businessman:
- The woman's total damages are $1,000, but she is 30% at fault. Her recovery is reduced by 30%, leaving her with 70% of $1,000, which is $700.

Thus, the appropriate judgment is that the businessman recovers $1,500 from the woman, and the woman recovers $700 from the businessman.

The correct answer is **G**. 

Answer: G
