Okay, so I've got this question about Ross and his critique of utilitarianism. I'm a bit rusty on my ethics, but I'll try to work through this step by step.

First, I remember that Ross was a philosopher who discussed ethical theories, particularly utilitarianism. Utilitarianism is the idea that actions are right if they promote the greatest happiness for the greatest number. But Ross had some issues with that approach.

I think Ross was part of the non-consequentialist camp. He believed that there's more to morality than just the outcomes of actions. I recall something about prima facie duties. Yeah, Ross argued that there are various moral duties or obligations that we should consider. These include things like keeping promises, not harming others, and so on. He thought that these duties are important regardless of the consequences.

So the question is about what Ross saw as the essential defect of utilitarianism. The options are A through J. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: the significance of moral intentions. Hmm. I think that's more of a Kantian point. Kant focused on the intentions behind actions, like the categorical imperative. So maybe not Ross's main point here.

Option B: epistemological responsibility. Not too sure what that refers to. Maybe something about knowledge and belief, but I don't think that's what Ross was focusing on.

Option C: the role of virtue in morality. Virtue ethics is another approach, but Ross was more about duties and obligations rather than virtues. So probably not C.

Option D: the value of pleasure. Wait, utilitarianism actually emphasizes pleasure. So this can't be what Ross is criticizing because he's against utilitarianism, but the option says it ignores it. So not D.

Option E: the importance of individual rights. This rings a bell. I think some critics argue that utilitarianism can override individual rights for the greater good. Ross might have pointed this out. But I'm not entirely sure if this is his main argument.

Option F: the potential consequences of actions. Wait, utilitarianism is all about consequences. So it can't be ignoring them. So F is not correct.

Option G: the concept of justice. Not sure. Justice can be a part of various ethical theories, but I'm not certain if Ross's main critique was about justice specifically.

Option H: moral obligations. Oh, right! Ross's theory is about prima facie duties or moral obligations. He believed that utilitarianism doesn't account for these because it focuses solely on outcomes. So H seems like a strong candidate.

Option I: the personal character of duty. Maybe related to H, but I'm not as sure about this phrasing. 

Option J: autonomy. That's more of a Kantian concept again. Autonomy refers to self-governance and acting according to one's own will. Not sure if Ross focused on that.

So narrowing it down, the main issue Ross had was that utilitarianism doesn't consider our various moral obligations, like keeping promises or not harming others, because it's solely focused on overall happiness. So the essential defect would be ignoring moral obligations, which is option H.

Wait, but another thought: there's another point I remember. Ross, in his book "The Right and the Good," argues that utilitarianism fails to account for the plurality of moral duties. He lists several prima facie duties, like fidelity (keeping promises), gratitude, justice, beneficence, self-improvement, and non-maleficence (not harming others). He thinks that these are distinct obligations that can't be reduced to just promoting pleasure or happiness.

So yes, the problem with utilitarianism, according to Ross, is that it ignores these moral obligations because it's too focused on the consequences. Therefore, the answer should be H: moral obligations.

Ross's critique of utilitarianism centers on its failure to account for moral obligations. Utilitarianism prioritizes outcomes, particularly the promotion of happiness, over the consideration of specific moral duties. Ross argued that there are prima facie duties—such as fidelity, gratitude, justice, and non-maleficence—that should be upheld regardless of their consequences. These obligations, he believed, are essential to morality and cannot be reduced to the utilitarian focus on overall happiness. Therefore, the essential defect of utilitarianism, according to Ross, is its disregard for moral obligations.

Answer: H
