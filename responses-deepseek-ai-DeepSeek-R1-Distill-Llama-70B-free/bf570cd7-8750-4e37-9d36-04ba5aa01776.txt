Okay, so I have this differential equation problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem is about an initial value problem, and I'm supposed to find the smallest beta where the solution has no minimum point. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but I'll take it slow.

The equation given is 2y'' + 3y' - 2y = 0. The initial conditions are y(0) = 1 and y'(0) = -beta, with beta being positive. So, the goal is to find the smallest beta so that the solution doesn't have any minimum points. Wait, so a minimum point is where the function stops decreasing and starts increasing, right? That would mean the first derivative is zero there, and the second derivative is positive (since it's a minimum).

First, I should probably solve the differential equation. It's a linear homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients, so the standard approach is to find the characteristic equation.

The equation is 2y'' +3y' -2y =0. So the characteristic equation would be replacing y'' with r^2, y' with r, and y with 1. So, 2r² +3r -2 =0.

Let me solve that quadratic equation. The quadratic formula is r = [-b ± sqrt(b²-4ac)]/(2a). Here, a=2, b=3, c=-2.

Calculating discriminant: b² -4ac = 9 + 16 = 25. Oh, that's a perfect square, so the roots will be real and distinct.

So the roots are r = [ -3 ± 5 ]/(4). Let's compute both:

First root: (-3 +5)/4 = 2/4 = 1/2.

Second root: (-3 -5)/4 = -8/4 = -2.

So the general solution is y(t) = C1 e^( (1/2) t ) + C2 e^(-2 t).

Now, I need to apply the initial conditions to find C1 and C2. The initial conditions are at t=0: y(0)=1, y'(0)=-beta.

First, compute y(0). Plugging t=0 into the general solution:

y(0) = C1 * e^0 + C2 * e^0 = C1 + C2 =1. So equation 1: C1 + C2 =1.

Next, find y'. Let's differentiate y(t):

y'(t) = (1/2) C1 e^( (1/2) t ) + (-2) C2 e^(-2 t).

At t=0: y'(0) = (1/2) C1 + (-2) C2 = -beta.

So equation 2: (1/2) C1 - 2 C2 = -beta.

Now I have two equations:

1. C1 + C2 =1.

2. (1/2)C1 -2 C2 = -beta.

I can solve these for C1 and C2. Let's rearrange equation 1: C1 =1 - C2.

Substitute into equation 2:

(1/2)(1 - C2) - 2 C2 = -beta.

Multiply through:

1/2 - (1/2) C2 - 2 C2 = -beta.

Combine like terms:

1/2 - ( (1/2) + 2 ) C2 = -beta.

Wait, 2 is like 4/2, so 1/2 +4/2 =5/2. So:

1/2 - (5/2) C2 = -beta.

Let me rearrange this:

(5/2) C2 = 1/2 + beta.

Multiply both sides by 2/5:

C2 = (1/2 + beta) * (2/5) )= (1 + 2 beta)/5.

Now, since C1 =1 - C2, we have C1 =1 - (1 + 2 beta)/5 = (5 -1 -2 beta)/5 = (4 - 2 beta)/5.

So the constants are C1=(4-2β)/5 and C2=(1+2β)/5.

Now, the solution is y(t) = C1 e^(t/2) + C2 e^(-2t).

Plugging in the constants:

y(t) = [(4-2β)/5] e^{t/2} + [ (1 + 2β)/5 ] e^{-2t}.

Now, the problem is to find the smallest beta where the solution has no minimum point. So, the function y(t) should have no minima. A minimum would occur where y'(t) =0 and y''(t) >0.

Wait, but in ODE terms, the minima of y(t) are critical points where the first derivative is zero and the second derivative is positive. So, if y'(t) =0 has no solution, then there are no critical points, so no minima. Alternatively, maybe the function is always increasing or something. Or perhaps the function is such that y' is always negative, so it's always decreasing, so no minima.

Wait, but the function is a combination of exponentials, one growing and one decaying. Hmm. Let me think about the behavior.

Wait, since e^{t/2} grows as t increases, and e^{-2t} decays. So depending on the coefficients, the solution might first decrease and then increase, leading to a minimum. Or perhaps for certain beta values, it doesn't have a minimum.

So, the first derivative is y'(t) = (1/2) C1 e^{t/2} - 2 C2 e^{-2t}.

We can set this equal to zero and see if it has real solutions.

So, set y'(t) =0:

(1/2) C1 e^{t/2} - 2 C2 e^{-2t} = 0.

Multiply both sides by e^{2t} to eliminate the denominator:

(1/2) C1 e^{t/2} e^{2t} - 2 C2 = 0.

Wait, e^{t/2} * e^{2t} = e^{(5t/2)}.

So, (1/2) C1 e^{(5t/2)} = 2 C2.

So, e^{(5t/2)} = (4 C2)/C1.

Taking natural log on both sides:

(5t/2) = ln(4 C2 / C1).

So, t = (2/5) ln(4 C2 / C1).

Hmm, so for real t, the argument of ln must be positive. So 4 C2 / C1 must be positive.

But we can have a solution only if 4 C2/C1 >0.

So, 4 C2/C1 >0 → C2/C1 >0 → C2 and C1 have the same sign.

Wait, let's think about C1 and C2 in terms of beta.

C1 = (4 -2β)/5.

C2 = (1 + 2β)/5.

We need to determine when 4 C2 / C1 is positive. Let's compute the ratio:

4 C2 / C1 = 4 * [ (1 + 2β)/5 ] / [ (4 - 2β)/5 ] = 4 (1 + 2β) / (4 - 2β).

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Denominator: 2(2 - β).

Numerator: 2(2β +1) * 2 → wait, 4(1+2β) is 4 +8β. Or perhaps it's better to factor. Let me see:

4 C2/C1 = [4*(1 + 2β)] / (4 - 2β) = [4(1+2β)] / [2(2 -β)] ) = [2(1+2β)] / (2 - β).

So, 4 C2/C1 = [2(1 + 2β)] / (2 - β).

We need this ratio to be positive for y'(t)=0 to have a real solution. Because if the ratio is positive, then the ln is defined. If it's negative, the equation y'=0 would have no real solution.

So, let's find when 2(1+2β)/(2 - β) >0.

The denominator is (2 - β). The numerator is 2*(1 +2β), which is positive when 1+2β >0 → β > -0.5. But since β>0, numerator is always positive.

So the sign of 4 C2/C1 depends on the denominator (2 - β).

So, when is (2 - β) positive? When β <2.

When β>2, denominator is negative, so 4 C2/C1 is negative.

If 4 C2/C1 is negative, then ln is undefined, so the equation y'=0 has no real solution.

Wait, but wait, if 4 C2/C1 is negative, then equation y'=0 has no real solution because e^{5t/2} is always positive. So in that case, y' is never zero, which would mean the function is either always increasing or always decreasing.

Wait, but the function is a combination of exponentials. Let me think about the behavior as t approaches infinity and negative infinity.

As t approaches infinity:

e^{t/2} dominates, so the term with C1 e^{t/2} will dominate. The coefficient C1 is (4 - 2β)/5. So, if C1 is positive, as t→infty, y(t) tends to infinity. If C1 is negative, y(t) tends to negative infinity.

Similarly, as t approaches negative infinity, e^{-2t} becomes large because t is negative, so -2t is positive. So, e^{-2t} grows as t→-infty. So the term C2 e^{-2t} dominates, and since C2 is (1 + 2β)/5, which is positive (since β>0), as t→-infty, y(t) tends to positive infinity if C2 is positive.

Wait, but for t very negative, e^{-2t} is e^{positive}, so it's huge. So y(t) would go to positive infinity as t→-infty, because C2 is positive.

At t=0, y(0)=1. So the function comes down from +infty at t=-infty to y(0)=1, and then depending on C1, either goes to +infty or -infty as t→infty.

Wait, but if C1 is positive, then as t→infty, y(t)→infty. If C1 is negative, y(t)→-infty.

So, let's think about the derivative. For y'(t)=0 to have a solution, the function must have a critical point. But when 4 C2/C1 is negative, that would require (2 - β) <0 → β>2. So when β>2, the equation y'=0 has no real solution, meaning y'(t) doesn't cross zero. So y'(t) would have a consistent sign.

But what's the sign of y'(t) when β>2?

Let me think about the derivative function. Let me see at t=0, y'(0) = -beta. So when β>0, y'(0) is negative. So at t=0, the function is decreasing.

If y'(t) never crosses zero, then y'(t) remains negative for all t>0. So the function is always decreasing. It starts at y=1, and keeps decreasing, approaching either a limit or negative infinity as t→infty, depending on C1.

Wait, but with C1 = (4 - 2β)/5. If β>2, then 4 -2β is negative. So C1 is negative. So as t→infty, y(t) tends to negative infinity. So the function would be decreasing from y=1, going downward without ever turning around. So no minimum point because it's always decreasing.

Wait, but wait, a minimum point would require a local minimum, which is a point where the function stops decreasing and starts increasing. So if the function is always decreasing (y' always negative), there's no minimum point.

So for beta >2, there are no minima.

But the question is, what's the smallest beta where the solution has no minimum point. So the smallest beta where the solution is always decreasing, i.e., when y' is always negative, so when equation y'=0 has no solution.

From earlier, that occurs when 4 C2/C1 is negative, which happens when 2 - beta <0 → beta>2.

So the minimal beta is 2. So the answer would be option E, which is 2.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Wait, suppose beta is exactly 2. Then 4 C2/C1 would be zero, because denominator 2 - beta is zero. But that would cause division by zero, which is undefined. So when beta=2, the denominator in 4 C2/C1 is zero.

Wait, wait, let me compute C1 and C2 when beta=2.

C1 = (4 - 2*2)/5 = (4-4)/5=0.

C2 = (1 + 2*2)/5 =5/5=1.

So y(t) becomes 0 * e^{t/2} + 1 *e^{-2t} = e^{-2t}.

Then y'(t) = -2 e^{-2t}, which is always negative. So the solution is always decreasing, with y(t)=e^{-2t}, so no minimum points.

So for beta=2, the solution has no minima. And for beta>2, as we saw, same situation.

Wait, but earlier analysis said that when beta>2, 4 C2/C1 is negative, making the equation y'=0 have no solution, thus the derivative doesn't cross zero, so y' is always negative.

Wait, but when beta=2, C1 is zero, so the solution is just e^{-2t}, which is always decreasing.

So the minimal beta where the solution has no minimum is beta=2. So the answer is E: 2.

To solve the initial value problem 

$$
2 y'' + 3 y' - 2 y = 0, \quad y(0) = 1, \quad y'(0) = -\beta,
$$

we first find the general solution of the differential equation. The characteristic equation is 

$$
2r^2 + 3r - 2 = 0.
$$

Using the quadratic formula, the roots are 

$$
r = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 16}}{4} = \frac{-3 \pm 5}{4}.
$$

This gives the roots \( r_1 = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( r_2 = -2 \). Thus, the general solution is 

$$
y(t) = C_1 e^{t/2} + C_2 e^{-2t}.
$$

Applying the initial conditions:

1. \( y(0) = 1 \) gives \( C_1 + C_2 = 1 \).
2. \( y'(0) = -\beta \) gives \( \frac{1}{2}C_1 - 2C_2 = -\beta \).

Solving these equations:

From \( C_1 + C_2 = 1 \), we get \( C_1 = 1 - C_2 \). Substituting into \( \frac{1}{2}C_1 - 2C_2 = -\beta \), we find:

$$
\frac{1}{2}(1 - C_2) - 2C_2 = -\beta \implies \frac{1}{2} - \frac{5}{2}C_2 = -\beta \implies C_2 = \frac{1 + 2\beta}{5}.
$$

Then, \( C_1 = 1 - C_2 = \frac{4 - 2\beta}{5} \). The solution becomes:

$$
y(t) = \frac{4 - 2\beta}{5} e^{t/2} + \frac{1 + 2\beta}{5} e^{-2t}.
$$

To determine when the solution has no minimum point, we analyze the first derivative:

$$
y'(t) = \frac{1}{2}C_1 e^{t/2} - 2C_2 e^{-2t}.
$$

Setting \( y'(t) = 0 \) gives:

$$
\frac{1}{2}C_1 e^{t/2} = 2C_2 e^{-2t} \implies e^{5t/2} = \frac{4C_2}{C_1}.
$$

For this equation to have no real solution, the ratio \( \frac{4C_2}{C_1} \) must be non-positive. Substituting \( C_1 = \frac{4 - 2\beta}{5} \) and \( C_2 = \frac{1 + 2\beta}{5} \), we find:

$$
\frac{4C_2}{C_1} = \frac{4 \cdot \frac{1 + 2\beta}{5}}{\frac{4 - 2\beta}{5}} = \frac{4(1 + 2\beta)}{4 - 2\beta} = \frac{2(1 + 2\beta)}{2 - \beta}.
$$

The denominator \( 2 - \beta \) determines the sign. For \( \frac{4C_2}{C_1} \) to be negative, \( 2 - \beta < 0 \), which occurs when \( \beta > 2 \). Thus, for \( \beta > 2 \), \( y'(t) \) has no real roots, meaning \( y(t) \) is always decreasing and has no minimum points.

The smallest \( \beta \) where the solution has no minimum point is \( \beta = 2 \).
