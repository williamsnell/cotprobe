Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. 

Alright, the question says there are four machines in a factory—A, B, C, and D—each producing the same product but in different proportions. Machine A makes 10% of the output, B 20%, C 30%, and D 40%. Now, each machine also has its own rate of producing defective items. The defective rates are: A is 0.001 (which is 0.1%), B is 0.0005 (0.05%), C is 0.005 (0.5%), and D is 0.002 (0.2%). 

The problem is asking: if I pick a defective item at random, what's the probability that it was made by each machine? So I need to find P(A|defective), P(B|defective), and so on for each machine.

Hmm, this sounds like a classic case for Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. The formula is P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B). In this case, A is the machine, and B is the event that the item is defective.

So, first, I think I need to calculate the total probability of selecting a defective item, which is P(defective). That should be the sum of the probabilities that each machine produces a defective item multiplied by the proportion of items each machine makes.

Let me break it down. For each machine:

- P(defective | A) = 0.001, and P(A) = 0.1 (since 10% is 0.1)
- P(defective | B) = 0.0005, P(B) = 0.2
- P(defective | C) = 0.005, P(C) = 0.3
- P(defective | D) = 0.002, P(D) = 0.4

Wait, wait. Oh, no, wait, I think I got that reversed. The 10%, 20%, etc., are the proportions of output, so they are P(A), P(B), etc. So P(A) is 0.1, P(B) 0.2, and so on.

So the joint probabilities P(defective and A) = P(defective|A) * P(A) = 0.001 * 0.1 = 0.0001.

Similarly, for each machine:

Machine A: 0.001 * 0.1 = 0.0001
Machine B: 0.0005 * 0.2 = 0.0001
Machine C: 0.005 * 0.3 = 0.0015
Machine D: 0.002 * 0.4 = 0.0008

Now, the total probability of a defective item, P(defective), is the sum of these values. Let's calculate that.

Adding them up:

0.0001 (A) + 0.0001 (B) = 0.0002
Plus 0.0015 (C) → 0.0017
Plus 0.0008 (D) → 0.0025

So P(defective) = 0.0025.

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem for each machine:

P(A | defective) = [P(defective|A) P(A)] / P(defective) = (0.0001) / 0.0025.

Let me compute that. 0.0001 divided by 0.0025. Let's see, 0.0001 is 1e-4, 0.0025 is 2.5e-3. So 1e-4 / 2.5e-3 = (1/2.5) * 1e-1 = 0.4 * 0.1 = 0.04. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 1e-4 divided by 2.5e-3 is (1/25) = 0.04? No, wait, 1e-4 is 0.0001, 2.5e-3 is 0.0025. So 0.0001 / 0.0025 = 0.04. So 4% is 0.04.

Wait, but 0.0001 is 0.01% of 1. Hmm, maybe another way: 0.0001 / 0.0025 = (0.0001 * 10000) / (0.0025 * 10000) = 1 / 25. Because 0.0025 * 10000 is 25. So 1/25 is 0.04. So yes, 0.04.

Similarly, for each machine:

P(A|defective) = 0.04 → 4% → 1/25.

P(B|defective) = (0.0005 * 0.2) / 0.0025 = 0.0001 / 0.0025 = same as A, so 0.04 → 1/25.

Wait, no, wait. Let me recheck:

Wait, for machine B, P(defective|B) is 0.0005, P(B)=0.2. So 0.0005 * 0.2 = 0.0001.

So P(B|defective) is 0.0001 / 0.0025 = 0.04. Same as A.

For machine C: P(defective|C)=0.005, P(C)=0.3. So 0.005 * 0.3 = 0.0015. Then 0.0015 / 0.0025 = 0.6. So 60%, which is 3/5.

For machine D: P(defective|D)=0.002, P(D)=0.4. So 0.002 * 0.4 = 0.0008. Then 0.0008 / 0.0025 = 0.32 → 32%.

Wait, 0.0008 / 0.0025 → 0.32? Let me compute: 0.0008 /0.0025 → 0.32. Yes, because 0.0025 is 1/400, so 0.0008 *400=0.32.

Wait, 0.32 is 8/25, since 8*4=32, 25*4=100. So 8/25 is 0.32.

Wait, but let's make sure: 0.0008 divided by 0.0025 equals (0.0008 * 10000)/(0.0025 * 10000) → 8/25 → 0.32.

So putting it all together:

P(A|defective) = 1/25 → 0.04 (4%)
P(B|defective) = 1/25 → 4%
P(C|defective) = 3/5 → 60%
P(D|defective) = 8/25 → 32%.

Wait, wait, wait a minute. Let me double-check the calculations because the sum should equal 1.

1/25 + 1/25 + 3/5 +8/25.

1/25 is 0.04, so 0.04 + 0.04 = 0.08. 3/5 is 0.6, and 8/25 is 0.32. Sum: 0.08 + 0.6 is 0.68, plus 0.32 is 1.0. So that checks out.

Now, looking at the options, let's see which one matches these values.

Option E: P(M1|defective) =1/25, P(M2)=1/25, P(M3)=3/5, P(M4)=8/25.

Yes, that matches what I calculated.

Looking at the options:

Option E: P(M1)=1/25, P(M2)=1/25, P(M3)=3/5, P(M4)=8/25.

So the correct answer is option E.

To solve the problem, we use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability that a defective item was produced by each machine. The given data includes the proportion of output for each machine (P(A) = 0.1, P(B) = 0.2, P(C) = 0.3, P(D) = 0.4) and the probability of producing a defective item for each machine (P(defective|A) = 0.001, P(defective|B) = 0.0005, P(defective|C) = 0.005, P(defective|D) = 0.002).

### Step 1: Calculate the joint probabilities
The joint probability of a machine producing a defective item is the product of the machine's output proportion and its defect rate:
- **P(defective and A)** = P(defective|A) * P(A) = \( 0.001 \times 0.1 = 0.0001 \)
- **P(defective and B)** = P(defective|B) * P(B) = \( 0.0005 \times 0.2 = 0.0001 \)
- **P(defective and C)** = P(defective|C) * P(C) = \( 0.005 \times 0.3 = 0.0015 \)
- **P(defective and D)** = P(defective|D) * P(D) = \( 0.002 \times 0.4 = 0.0008 \)

### Step 2: Calculate the total probability of a defective item
The total probability of selecting a defective item, \( P(\text{defective}) \), is the sum of the joint probabilities:
\[
P(\text{defective}) = 0.0001 + 0.0001 + 0.0015 + 0.0008 = 0.0025
\]

### Step 3: Apply Bayes' Theorem
Using Bayes' Theorem, the probability that a defective item was produced by a specific machine is:
\[
P(\text{Machine} | \text{defective}) = \frac{P(\text{defective and Machine})}{P(\text{defective})}
\]

- **P(A | defective)** = \( \frac{0.0001}{0.0025} = \frac{1}{25} \)
- **P(B | defective)** = \( \frac{0.0001}{0.0025} = \frac{1}{25} \)
- **P(C | defective)** = \( \frac{0.0015}{0.0025} = \frac{3}{5} \)
- **P(D | defective)** = \( \frac{0.0008}{0.0025} = \frac{8}{25} \)

### Step 4: Verify the results
The probabilities sum to 1:
\[
\frac{1}{25} + \frac{1}{25} + \frac{3}{5} + \frac{8}{25} = 1
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The calculated probabilities match **Option E**:
- \( P(A | \text{defective}) = \frac{1}{25} \)
- \( P(B | \text{defective}) = \frac{1}{25} \)
- \( P(C | \text{defective}) = \frac{3}{5} \)
- \( P(D | \text{defective}) = \frac{8}{25} \)
