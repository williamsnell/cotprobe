Okay, so I've got this question here about a woman trying to cash a Social Security check at a convenience store. The owner says he can't cash it, and then she threatens to blow up the store if he doesn't give her money. But here's the thing: she didn't actually have a bomb. The owner wasn't fooled but still gave her the money because he felt sorry for her. Then she leaves without endorsing the check. The question is asking what crime, if any, she's committed.

Alright, let's break this down. I'm a bit rusty on criminal law, but let's try to think it through step by step. So the key elements here are the threat and the obtaining of money through that threat.

First, let's consider robbery. Robbery typically involves the taking of property from a person using force or the threat of force, with the intent to deprive them of it. Here, the woman threatened to blow up the store, which is a pretty serious threat. But wait, she didn't actually have a bomb, so was the owner in immediate fear? The question says the owner wasn't deceived, so he didn't believe there was a bomb. But does that matter? I think for robbery, the threat has to be such that it instills fear in the victim. If the owner wasn't actually afraid because he knew she didn't have a bomb, then maybe it's not robbery.

Hmm, but wait, some jurisdictions might consider whether a reasonable person would feel threatened, not just the actual victim's state of mind. So if a reasonable person would feel threatened by the bomb claim, even if the owner wasn't, maybe it still counts. But I'm not sure. I think the traditional view is that the victim must be placed in immediate fear. So if the owner wasn't scared, perhaps it's not robbery.

Next, let's think about attempted robbery. Attempt requires specific intent to commit the crime and a substantial step towards it. She made the threat, which could be an attempt. But again, if the owner wasn't actually in fear, does that affect whether the attempt was successful? I think attempt doesn't require the crime to be completed, just the intent and action toward it. So maybe she's guilty of attempted robbery because she intended to take the money through the threat, even if the threat didn't work as intended.

Wait, but she did get the money. So the owner gave her the money because he felt sorry for her, not because he was scared. So perhaps the threat wasn't the reason he complied. If the threat didn't cause the owner to give the money, then maybe she didn't actually commit robbery. Because robbery requires the threat to be the means by which the property is obtained. If the owner gave the money out of sympathy, then the threat wasn't the cause. So she might not have committed robbery in that case.

But then, what about attempted robbery? She made the threat with the intent to take the money, but it wasn't successful in causing the owner to give it. Wait, no, she did get the money. So maybe the fact that she got the money through the threat, regardless of the owner's motivation, counts. But if the owner wasn't actually afraid, then perhaps the threat wasn't effective, so she didn't complete the robbery. But she still took the money, so I'm a bit confused here.

Let me think about the elements again. For robbery, the taking must be accomplished through force or threat of force that puts the victim in fear. If the victim wasn't in fear, maybe it's not robbery. But she still took the money under false pretenses, perhaps. Wait, but she used a threat, so it's more like robbery than fraud or false pretenses.

Wait, another angle: she made a false statement about having a bomb to get the money. So that's a threat. But the owner wasn't deceived. So maybe she's guilty of making a criminal threat, but that's not one of the options. The options given are things like blackmail, fraud, conspiracy, robbery, etc.

Looking at the options, A is blackmail. Blackmail involves threatening to reveal a secret or something unless money is given. Here, she's threatening to blow up the store. That's more of a direct threat of violence, so maybe not blackmail.

B is fraud. Fraud requires deception with intent to deprive. She lied about having a bomb, but the owner wasn't deceived. So maybe there's no fraud because the owner didn't rely on the false statement. So fraud might not apply here.

C is conspiracy to commit robbery. There's no indication she was working with anyone else, so probably not.

D is robbery. As discussed earlier, that depends on whether the owner was in fear. If he wasn't, then maybe not.

E is false pretenses. Similar to fraud, where you obtain title through a false representation. Again, if the owner wasn't deceived, then false pretenses wouldn't apply.

F is no crime. That seems unlikely because she did make a threat, even if the owner wasn't scared.

G is assault. Assault requires intentional act that causes apprehension of imminent harmful contact. She didn't touch him or make any movement towards him, just verbal threat. So maybe not assault.

H is attempted robbery. So if she intended to commit robbery but didn't complete it because the threat didn't work, then maybe attempted robbery applies.

I is threatening behavior. That could be a possibility, but it's a more general offense. But looking at the options, H is attempted robbery. So perhaps that's the better fit.

Wait, but she did get the money. So if the owner gave her the money because of her threat, even if he wasn't scared, does that still count as robbery? Or does the owner's state of mind matter?

In some jurisdictions, robbery doesn't require the victim to actually be afraid, just that the threat is such that a reasonable person would be in fear. So if a reasonable person would feel threatened by a bomb, then it's robbery, regardless of the owner's actual reaction. So maybe she did commit robbery because the threat was sufficient to cause fear in a reasonable person, even if this particular owner wasn't scared.

But if the owner wasn't scared and gave the money out of sympathy, then perhaps the threat wasn't the cause of him giving the money. So without the causal link, it's not robbery. So maybe she only attempted robbery because she tried to use the threat to get the money, but didn't succeed in causing fear. But she still got the money, so I'm a bit stuck.

Alternatively, maybe she committed theft by threat, which would be robbery. But again, the issue is whether the threat was effective in causing fear. If the owner wasn't in fear, maybe it's not robbery. But she did take the money through a threat, so perhaps it's robbery regardless.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to outline the elements:

Robbery: the unlawful taking and carrying away of someone's property with the intent to permanently deprive them of it, accomplished by force or threat of force, which puts the victim in immediate fear of harm.

So, the threat must be such that the victim is in fear. If the owner wasn't in fear, then maybe it's not robbery. But she did make a threat, so perhaps it's attempted robbery.

But she did get the money. So if the owner gave her the money because of the threat, even if he wasn't scared, maybe it's still robbery because the threat was the means. But if the owner gave the money for another reason (sympathy), then the threat wasn't the cause, so it's not robbery.

Wait, the question says the owner "agreed to cash the check" after she made the threat, but he felt sorry for her. So perhaps the threat wasn't the reason he gave the money. If that's the case, then she didn't obtain the money through the threat, so robbery wouldn't apply. But she still made the threat, which could be attempted robbery.

So, attempted robbery would require that she intended to take the money through the threat, and took a substantial step towards it. She made the threat, which is a substantial step. So even if the owner didn't comply because of fear, but she intended to make him comply through fear, then she's guilty of attempted robbery.

So the answer would be H: Attempted robbery.

Wait, but another angle: she obtained the money through a false threat. So maybe she's guilty of larceny by trick. But that's similar to false pretenses. But the owner wasn't deceived, so that wouldn't apply.

Alternatively, could it be extortion? Extortion is obtaining property through a threat. But extortion usually involves threats to accuse of a crime, or harm, etc. So maybe that's another possibility, but it's not one of the options listed. The options are A to I, and H is attempted robbery.

So, putting it all together, I think the answer is H: Attempted robbery.

The question revolves around determining the crime committed by an elderly woman who threatened to blow up a convenience store to cash her Social Security check. The key elements to analyze are the threat, the owner's reaction, and the outcome.

1. **Robbery**: Robbery requires the taking of property through force or threat of force that places the victim in immediate fear. Although the woman made a threatening statement, the owner was not deceived or fearful. However, some jurisdictions consider whether a reasonable person would feel threatened, regardless of the victim's actual fear. If the threat is deemed sufficient to cause fear in a reasonable person, robbery could apply. However, if the owner gave the money out of sympathy rather than fear, the threat may not have been the cause of the money transfer, weakening the case for robbery.

2. **Attempted Robbery**: Attempted robbery involves the intent to commit robbery and a substantial step toward it. The woman made a threat and intended to obtain money through it, which could qualify as a substantial step. Even if the owner was not fearful, the intent and action might still satisfy the elements of attempted robbery.

3. **Blackmail, Fraud, False Pretenses, and Conspiracy**: These crimes involve deception or collaboration. Since the owner was not deceived by the threat, fraud and false pretenses do not apply. Blackmail typically involves threats to reveal secrets, which is not the case here. Conspiracy requires collaboration, which is absent.

4. **Assault and Threatening Behavior**: Assault requires an act that causes apprehension of imminent harm, which was not present here. Threatening behavior is a broader category, but attempted robbery is a more specific and fitting charge.

5. **No Crime**: This is unlikely, as the woman made a threat, even if the owner was not fearful.

Given the analysis, the most fitting charge is **attempted robbery**, as the woman intended to use the threat to obtain money and took a substantial step toward that goal, even if the threat did not cause fear or directly result in the money transfer.

Answer: H
