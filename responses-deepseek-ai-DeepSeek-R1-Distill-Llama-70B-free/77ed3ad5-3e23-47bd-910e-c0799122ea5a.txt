Question:

A male bacterium conjugates with a female bacterium. After conjugation, the female becomes a male. Account for this "sexchange".

Options:

A: The female bacterium becomes a male as a result of nutrient deficiency
B: The female becomes a male by receiving one copy of the F factor
C: The female bacterium becomes a male through the process of osmosis
D: The female bacterium becomes a male through gene mutation
E: The female bacterium becomes a male after receiving multiple copies of non-F factor genes
F: The female bacterium becomes a male through binary fission
G: The female bacterium becomes a male by incorporating a plasmid unrelated to the F factor
H: The female bacterium becomes a male after exposure to antibiotics
I: The female bacterium becomes a male due to a viral infection
J: The female bacterium becomes a male due to environmental factors

Okay, so I've got this biology question in front of me about bacterial conjugation. Hmm, I remember that bacterial conjugation involves the transfer of genetic material between bacteria, usually through a structure called a pilus. Let me think about what I learned before.

The question says a male bacterium conjugates with a female. After that, the female becomes a male. I need to explain why. So, why would the female change into a male?

Wait, in bacterial terms, "male" and "female" aren't really accurate, but in conjugation, they refer to the F+ and F- strains. The F+ (male) has the F plasmid, which allows them to act as donors. The F- (female) lacks this plasmid and acts as the recipient.

So during conjugation, the F+ bacterium transfers the F plasmid to the F- bacterium. Oh wait, but the F plasmid is a circular piece of DNA that can replicate itself. So the F- would receive this plasmid and become F+. That would make it a "male" now.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option B says the female becomes male by receiving one copy of the F factor. That sounds right because the F factor is the plasmid. So when the female (F-) gets the F plasmid, she becomes F+, hence a male.

Wait, any other options that might fit? Let's check. Option G talks about an unrelated plasmid, which doesn't make sense. Option E is multiple copies of non-F genes, not relevant. Option D is mutation, but conjugation is about gene transfer, not mutation. So B seems correct.

Other options: A is nutrient deficiency, which I don't think relates. C is osmosis, which is about water and solutes, not DNA transfer. F is binary fission, which is how bacteria reproduce but not related to conjugation. H is antibiotics, no connection here. I is viral infection, that's transduction, not conjugation. J is environmental factors, maybe, but the direct cause is the F factor transfer.

So the correct answer must be B.

The question involves bacterial conjugation, where a male bacterium (F+) transfers genetic material to a female bacterium (F-). In this process, the male transfers the F plasmid, a circular DNA molecule, to the female. This plasmid allows the female to become F+, effectively turning it into a "male." Among the options, the correct explanation is that the female becomes male by receiving one copy of the F factor, as this directly accounts for the transfer of the plasmid during conjugation. Other options, such as nutrient deficiency, osmosis, or environmental factors, do not explain this specific genetic transfer.

Answer: B
