Okay, so I've got this algebra problem here, and I need to find the other solution to an equation. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says: (x - p)(x - q) = (r - p)(r - q), and one solution is x = r. I need to find the other solution in terms of p, q, and r. The options are given from A to J.

Hmm. Let's think about what this equation represents. On the left side, expanding (x-p)(x-q) gives x² - (p+q)x + pq. The right side is just a constant because it's (r-p)(r-q). So the equation is a quadratic equation in x.

Wait, if one solution is x = r, then when I plug r into the left side, it equals the right side. That makes sense because the right side is (r-p)(r-q), so substituting x=r gives (r-p)(r-q) on both sides. So r is definitely a root.

In a quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0, the sum of the roots is -b/a, and the product is c/a. So if one root is r, the other root, let's call it s, should satisfy r + s = (p + q) because when we expand the left side, the coefficient of x is -(p+q), so the sum of roots is p + q.

Wait, let me double-check that. The equation is (x-p)(x-q) = (r-p)(r-q). Expanding the left side gives x² - (p+q)x + pq. So the equation becomes x² - (p+q)x + pq = (r-p)(r-q). Let me bring everything to one side: x² - (p+q)x + pq - (r-p)(r-q) = 0.

So the quadratic equation is x² - (p+q)x + [pq - (r-p)(r-q)] = 0.

Now, the sum of the roots of this quadratic equation is (p + q). Because for ax² + bx + c = 0, sum is -b/a. Here a is 1, so sum is (p+q).

We know one root is r, so let the other root be s. Then r + s = p + q. So s must be (p + q) - r.

Wait, that makes sense. So the other solution is p + q - r, which is option B.

Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let's also think about the product of the roots. The product is c/a, which in this case is [pq - (r-p)(r-q)] divided by 1, so pq - (r-p)(r-q).

So the product of the roots r and s is pq - (r-p)(r-q). Let me expand (r-p)(r-q) to check:

(r-p)(r-q) = r² - rq - pr + pq.

So pq - (r² - rq - pr + pq) = pq - r² + rq + pr - pq = -r² + rq + pr.

So r * s = -r² + rq + pr. Let me factor out r: r(s) = r(-r + q + p). Since s is (p + q - r), then:

r*(p + q - r) = r(p + q) - r² = rp + rq - r². Which matches the product we found earlier. So that checks out.

So yes, the other solution is p + q - r.

The given equation is \((x - p)(x - q) = (r - p)(r - q)\), where \(x = r\) is one solution. To find the other solution, we first recognize that this is a quadratic equation in \(x\). Expanding the left-hand side gives \(x^2 - (p+q)x + pq\), and the right-hand side is a constant \((r-p)(r-q)\). Rewriting the equation as:

\[
x^2 - (p+q)x + pq - (r-p)(r-q) = 0,
\]

we see that the sum of the roots of this quadratic equation is given by \(-(b/a)\), where \(a = 1\) and \(b = -(p+q)\). Thus, the sum of the roots is \(p + q\).

Since one root is \(x = r\), let the other root be \(s\). Then:

\[
r + s = p + q \implies s = p + q - r.
\]

To verify, the product of the roots is given by \(c/a\), where \(c = pq - (r-p)(r-q)\). Expanding \((r-p)(r-q)\) gives \(r^2 - rq - pr + pq\), so:

\[
pq - (r^2 - rq - pr + pq) = -r^2 + rq + pr.
\]

The product of the roots \(r \cdot s\) should equal this expression. Substituting \(s = p + q - r\):

\[
r \cdot (p + q - r) = rp + rq - r^2,
\]

which matches the earlier result. Thus, the other solution is indeed \(p + q - r\).

The correct answer is:

**B: \(p + q - r\)**
