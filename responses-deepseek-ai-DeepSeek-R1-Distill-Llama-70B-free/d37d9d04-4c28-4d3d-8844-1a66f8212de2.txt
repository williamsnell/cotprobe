Question:

In 1888, a landowner owned a dairy farm. The landowner conveyed this real property to his son in1938. In 1953, the son conveyed the dairy farm to his friend. This deed was not recorded until after the son's death in 1957. In 1956, the son mortgaged the dairy farm to the bank. The mortgage instrument, which was recorded in 1956, recited that it was subordinate to a mortgage on the same land given by the son to an investor in 1936 and recorded in 1936. In that instrument the son purported to grant the investor a mortgage on the dairy farm. In 1979, the friend conveyed the dairy farm to a farmer. This deed was duly recorded, but did not mention any mortgage. In 2008, a buyer entered into an agreement with the farmer, whereby the farmer would convey the dairy farm in fee simple to the buyer for the sum of $75,000. The closing date was set for January 15, 2009. All of the deeds mentioned in the aforementioned transactions are general warranty deeds. In addition, this jurisdiction has a notice-type recording statute and follows a title theory for mortgages. On January 15, 2009, the sale of the dairy farm is finalized and the buyer paid the farmer $75,000. The fanner executed a general warranty deed. The deed contains the following covenants of title:(1) Covenant for seisin. (2) Covenant of the right to convey. (3) Covenant against encumbrances. After the buyer takes possession of the dairy farm, he learns of the son investor 1936 mortgage, which was not satisfied, and seeks monetary damages for breach of the covenant against encumbrances. Judgment should be for

Options:

A: the farmer, unless the covenantee is disturbed in his actual enjoyment of the land thereby conveyed.
B: the buyer, if the farmer knew about the mortgage to the investor but did not disclose it.
C: the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances protects against future claims on the property.
D: the buyer, because the covenant of the right to convey was breached.
E: the farmer, because the son's mortgage to the investor was not mentioned in the deed.
F: the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances is a guarantee to the grantee that the property is not subject to outstanding rights or interests.
G: the farmer, if the mortgage to the investor was satisfied before the sale to the buyer.
H: the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances would be breached at the time the deed was delivered, thereby entitling the covenantee to recover damages.
I: the farmer, because the buyer did not perform a thorough title search before purchasing the property.
J: the farmer, because the covenant against encumbrances may only be breached, if at all, at the time of conveyance.

Okay, so I have this real property question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem starts in 1888 with a landowner who has a dairy farm. Over the years, the property changes hands several times through various conveyances. The key issue seems to revolve around mortgages and whether they were properly recorded, and how that affects the covenants in the deeds.

Let me outline the timeline to get a clearer picture:

1. 1888: Landowner owns the dairy farm.
2. 1938: Landowner conveys the farm to his son. I'm assuming this is a valid conveyance, probably by a deed.
3. 1953: The son conveys the farm to his friend. However, this deed isn't recorded until after the son's death in 1957. So there's a delay in recording here.
4. 1956: The son mortgages the farm to the bank. The mortgage is recorded in 1956. The mortgage instrument says it's subordinate to a mortgage given to an investor in 1936, which was recorded in 1936. So the investor's mortgage is senior to the bank's mortgage.
5. 1979: The friend conveys the farm to a farmer. The deed is recorded but doesn't mention any mortgage.
6. 2008: The farmer agrees to sell the farm to a buyer for $75,000, with a closing on Jan 15, 2009. The farmer uses a general warranty deed. The deed includes covenants of title: seisin, right to convey, and against encumbrances.

After the sale, the buyer discovers the 1936 mortgage from the son to the investor, which wasn't satisfied. The buyer is suing for breach of the covenant against encumbrances.

The question is about who should get the judgment, the buyer or the farmer.

First, I need to understand the covenants. In a general warranty deed, the grantor typically makes several covenants, including the covenant against encumbrances. This covenant promises that the property is free of any liens or encumbrances except as stated in the deed.

In this case, the deed from the farmer to the buyer didn't mention any mortgages. But there's an outstanding mortgage from 1936. Wait, but when was that mortgage created? It was in 1936 by the son, and it was recorded then.

So, let's think about the chain of title and who had the property when. The landowner conveyed to the son in 1938. The son then got a mortgage in 1936? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, the son got the mortgage in 1936, but he only got the property in 1938. That seems impossible because you can't mortgage property you don't own yet. Hmm, maybe I misread that.

Wait, looking again: in 1938, the landowner conveyed to the son. Then in 1953, the son conveys to the friend, but the deed is recorded in 1957. In 1956, the son mortgages to the bank, and the mortgage says it's subordinate to the 1936 mortgage. Wait, so the son gave a mortgage to the investor in 1936, but he didn't own the property until 1938. That seems problematic because he couldn't mortgage property he didn't own yet. So perhaps that's a mistake in the question, or maybe I'm misunderstanding it. Alternatively, maybe the investor's mortgage was given when the son took ownership in 1938 but the mortgage was created in 1936. Hmm, that doesn't make sense either.

Wait, maybe the 1936 mortgage was from the landowner to the investor before he conveyed the property to the son. So the landowner owned the property, mortgaged it to the investor in 1936, then conveyed it to the son in 1938. Then, when the son mortgaged to the bank in 1956, that mortgage was subordinate to the 1936 one. That makes more sense. So the investor's mortgage would have been on the property when the son got it, and the son's mortgage to the bank would be junior to that.

So, the investor's mortgage was recorded in 1936, before the son owned the property. Then, in 1938, the landowner (who presumably had the mortgage) conveys to the son. Wait, but if the landowner had a mortgage, he might have had to satisfy it upon conveyance. Alternatively, the mortgage would encumber the property even after the conveyance to the son.

Wait, but this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to think differently. The key issue is the covenant against encumbrances. The farmer conveyed the property to the buyer with a general warranty deed that included a covenant against encumbrances. The buyer later found out about the 1936 mortgage, which was not satisfied.

So, does the existence of this mortgage constitute a breach of the covenant against encumbrances?

In a notice-type recording jurisdiction, a subsequent purchaser who takes without notice of a prior unrecorded conveyance is protected. But here, the 1936 mortgage was recorded in 1936, so anyone who did a title search would find it.

Wait, but in 1979, the friend conveyed to the farmer. The deed didn't mention any mortgage, but the mortgage was recorded. So when the farmer bought the property, the mortgage was already on record. Then, the farmer sold to the buyer in 2009. The buyer's deed didn't mention the mortgage, but the mortgage was still on record.

Wait, but when the farmer took the property in 1979, did he take it subject to the existing mortgages? Or were those mortgages extinguished somehow?

Wait, the son conveyed to the friend in 1953, but the deed wasn't recorded until 1957. So when the son mortgaged to the bank in 1956, was that mortgage valid? Because at that time, the son had already conveyed to the friend in 1953, albeit the deed wasn't recorded until 1957.

In a notice jurisdiction, when a deed is not recorded, a subsequent bona fide purchaser for value without notice can take the property free of that prior conveyance. So if the son conveyed to the friend in 1953 but didn't record it until 1957, and then in 1956, the son mortgaged to the bank, the bank might have had no notice of the prior conveyance to the friend. So the bank's mortgage could be valid against the friend if the bank was a BFP.

Wait, but the friend's deed was recorded in 1957, which is after the bank's mortgage was recorded in 1956. So the bank's mortgage was recorded before the friend's deed. But in a notice jurisdiction, the bank, when taking the mortgage in 1956, would have done a title search. If the friend's deed wasn't recorded until 1957, the bank, in 1956, wouldn't have had notice of it. So the bank's mortgage would take priority over the friend's ownership, making the friend's ownership subject to the bank's mortgage. Wait, but the friend's deed was from the son in 1953, which wasn't recorded until 1957. So when the bank took the mortgage in 1956, the bank's search would have shown the son as owner, because the friend's deed wasn't recorded yet. So the bank's mortgage is valid, and when the friend's deed is recorded in 1957, the friend takes subject to the bank's mortgage.

But wait, the bank's mortgage was subordinate to the 1936 mortgage. So the 1936 mortgage from the landowner to the investor was recorded in 1936. Then, in 1938, the landowner conveyed to the son, so the son took the property subject to that mortgage. Then, in 1956, the son gave a mortgage to the bank, which was subordinate to the 1936 mortgage. So the investor's mortgage is senior to the bank's.

So, when the son conveyed to the friend in 1953, the friend took the property subject to both the 1936 and 1956 mortgages. But when the friend's deed was recorded in 1957, after the bank's mortgage was recorded in 1956, the bank's mortgage is still valid, as the friend's deed was not recorded until after.

Wait, but the friend's deed was from 1953, so when the bank took the mortgage in 1956, the bank had no notice of the friend's deed because it wasn't recorded until 1957. So the bank's mortgage would be a lien against the property, even after the friend's deed is recorded. So the friend's ownership is subject to both mortgages.

Then, in 1979, the friend conveys to the farmer. The deed is recorded but doesn't mention any mortgages. So the farmer would take the property subject to any existing mortgages, unless they were satisfied.

In 2008, the farmer sells to the buyer. The farmer's deed includes a covenant against encumbrances. The buyer later finds out about the 1936 mortgage, which wasn't satisfied. So the buyer is suing for breach of that covenant.

The covenant against encumbrances is a present covenant, meaning it is breached if, at the time of conveyance, there are encumbrances. So, if the 1936 mortgage was still outstanding at the time the farmer conveyed to the buyer, that would breach the covenant.

But wait, let's think about whether the 1936 mortgage is still valid. The original mortgage was from the landowner to the investor in 1936. The landowner conveyed the property to the son in 1938, so the son took the property subject to that mortgage. Then, the son conveyed to the friend in 1953, who then took subject to that mortgage. The friend conveyed to the farmer in 1979, so the farmer took subject to it as well.

The farmer then sold to the buyer in 2009, but the covenant against encumbrances would require that, at the time of conveyance, the property is free of encumbrances except as noted. Since the deed didn't mention the 1936 mortgage, and it's still outstanding, the farmer would be in breach.

Wait, but the farmer might argue that the mortgage was paid off or satisfied, but the question says it wasn't. So the buyer is correct in suing.

Now, looking at the options:

Option H says: the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances would be breached at the time the deed was delivered, thereby entitling the covenantee to recover damages.

Option F says: the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances is a guarantee that the property is not subject to outstanding rights or interests.

Option J says: the farmer, because the covenant against encumbrances may only be breached, if at all, at the time of conveyance.

Wait, but the covenant against encumbrances is a present covenant, so it's breached when the deed is delivered, if there's an encumbrance at that time. So the buyer can sue immediately upon discovering the encumbrance, even if they aren't disturbed because the covenant is breached at the time of conveyance.

So, option H says that the breach occurs at the time the deed was delivered, so the buyer can recover damages. That makes sense.

Option F is also about the covenant being a guarantee against encumbrances. That's correct, but the question is about when the breach occurs.

Option J says the farmer is liable only if the mortgage was present at the time of conveyance, which it was. So J says the farmer is liable only if the breach occurred at conveyance. But J is phrased as "may only be breached, if at all, at the time of conveyance," which is correct. So the breach occurs then, making the farmer liable.

Wait, but the question is, who is judgment for? The options:

H says buyer because breach at conveyance.

J says farmer only if breach at conveyance.

Wait, but option J says "the farmer, because the covenant against encumbrances may only be breached, if at all, at the time of conveyance." So that would mean that if the breach occurred at conveyance, then the farmer is liable, but J's option is that the farmer is only liable if it's breached at conveyance, but the buyer is suing for that.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The covenant against encumbrances is a present covenant, so it's breached when the deed is delivered if there's an encumbrance. Therefore, the buyer can sue for that breach, regardless of whether they've been disturbed. So the correct answer would be that the buyer can recover because the covenant was breached at the time of conveyance.

Looking at the options, option H says that. Option H: the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances would be breached at the time the deed was delivered, thereby entitling the covenantee to recover damages.

Option J says the farmer is liable only if breach at conveyance, but that's not exactly right because the breach did occur at conveyance. So the buyer would win.

Wait, but the question is, does the existence of the encumbrance at the time of conveyance automatically entitle the buyer to damages, regardless of whether the buyer was actually harmed by it (like if the mortgage is foreclosed upon). The covenant against encumbrances is breached upon conveyance, even if the buyer hasn't suffered any disturbance yet. So the buyer can sue for damages immediately.

So the correct answer is either H or F. Option F says it's a guarantee against outstanding rights or interests, which is correct, but the timing is also important. Option H focuses on the time of breach, which is key here.

So the judgment should be for the buyer because the covenant was breached when the deed was delivered, as the encumbrance existed then.

The question revolves around a chain of title involving a dairy farm and the breach of the covenant against encumbrances in a general warranty deed. The key issue is whether the buyer can recover damages from the farmer for the existence of an outstanding mortgage from 1936 that was not satisfied or mentioned in the deed.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Covenant Against Encumbrances**: This is a present covenant, meaning it is breached if there are any outstanding liens or encumbrances on the property at the time of conveyance. The farmer's deed to the buyer did not mention the 1936 mortgage, and the mortgage was still outstanding when the property was conveyed to the buyer in 2009.

2. **Timing of the Breach**: The covenant against encumbrances is breached at the time the deed is delivered, provided an encumbrance exists at that moment. The buyer does not need to suffer actual disturbance or harm (e.g., foreclosure) to recover damages. The mere existence of the encumbrance at the time of conveyance is sufficient to establish a breach.

3. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option H**: Correctly states that the covenant against encumbrances is breached at the time the deed is delivered, entitling the buyer to recover damages. This aligns with the principle that the covenant is a present covenant.
   - **Option J**: Incorrectly suggests that the farmer may only be liable if the breach occurred at the time of conveyance. However, the breach did occur at the time of conveyance, making the farmer liable.
   - Other options either misstate the nature of the covenant or introduce irrelevant factors (e.g., the buyer's failure to perform a title search).

### Conclusion:
The judgment should be for the buyer because the covenant against encumbrances was breached at the time the deed was delivered, as the 1936 mortgage was still outstanding and not mentioned in the deed. The buyer is entitled to recover damages for this breach.
