Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that we have a sample of 3.00 moles of a diatomic perfect gas. It's being compressed reversibly and adiabatically, and its temperature increases from 200 K to 250 K. We're given that the molar heat capacity at constant volume, Cv,m, is 27.5 J/K/mol. The question is asking for the change in enthalpy, ΔH.

Hmm, right. Enthalpy change... I remember that for a process, the change in enthalpy (ΔH) is calculated using the formula ΔH = n * Cv,m * (T2 - T1) + something... Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, that's not right. Oh wait, no—enthalpy is a state function, and for an ideal gas, the enthalpy change depends only on the temperature change because the enthalpy of an ideal gas is a function of temperature alone. So ΔH should be n * Cp,m * ΔT, right?

Wait, but wait another moment. Wait, in an adiabatic process, no heat is exchanged (Q=0). But the process here is adiabatic and reversible, so it's an isentropic process. But the question isn't directly about entropy, it's about enthalpy change.

So, for an ideal gas, the enthalpy change is given by ΔH = n * Cp,m * (T2 - T1). Because H is a function of temperature only for ideal gases. So I think that's the way to go here.

But wait, wait a minute. Cp and Cv are related. For diatomic gases, the degrees of freedom are more, so Cv is higher. Oh, right, the Cv given is 27.5 J/K/mol. Wait, for diatomic gases, the molar specific heat at constant volume, Cv,m, is (5/2)R, right? Let me check: R is 8.314 J/mol·K. So (5/2)*8.314 is about 20.785 J/mol·K. But wait, the given Cv is 27.5, which is higher. Oh, wait, maybe at higher temperatures, diatomic gases have more degrees of freedom. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is polyatomic? Wait, but the problem says diatomic. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The problem gives a specific value, so I should use that.

Anyway, the main point is to find ΔH. So, since the process is adiabatic and for an ideal gas, the work done is related to the temperature change. But since the question is about ΔH, it's independent of the path and depends only on initial and final states.

So, let's compute it. The formula is ΔH = n * Cp,m * ΔT.

But wait, wait. What is Cp in terms of Cv? Cp = Cv + R, that's the Mayer relation. So Cp,m = Cv,m + R.

Given Cv,m is 27.5 J/K/mol. So Cp,m = 27.5 + 8.314 ≈ 35.814 J/K/mol.

Now, n is 3.00 mol. The temperature change, ΔT, is T2 - T1 = 250 K - 200 K = 50 K.

So, ΔH = 3.00 mol * 35.814 J/K/mol * 50 K.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 3 * 35.814 = 107.442 J/K.

Then, multiply by 50 K: 107.442 * 50 = 5372.1 J.

Convert that to kJ: 5372.1 J = 5.3721 kJ. So approximately +5.37 kJ.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option H is +5.4 kJ. That's very close. So that's probably the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, n is 3.00, correct. Cv,m is 27.5, so Cp is 27.5 + 8.314 ≈ 35.814. Correct.

3 * 35.814 = let me compute that again. 35 *3 is 105, 0.814*3 is ~2.442. So total is about 107.442. Then 107.442 *50 = 5372.1 J, which is 5.372 kJ. So that's approximately 5.37 kJ, which would round to 5.4 kJ. So option H is +5.4 kJ.

But wait another thought: the process is adiabatic, so Q=0. For an adiabatic process in an ideal gas, the work done is related to the temperature change. The formula for work is W = n Cv,m (T2 - T1). But that's for the work done by the system when it's expanding. Wait, in this case, the gas is being compressed, so work is done on the system. Hmm, but the question is about enthalpy change, not about work or internal energy change.

So, the process being adiabatic doesn't affect the calculation of ΔH because H only depends on T. So whether the process is adiabatic or not, ΔH is the same as long as the initial and final temperatures are the same.

So, my approach is correct. So the answer should be H, +5.4 kJ.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option H is +5.4 kJ, yes. So that's the one.

To calculate the change in enthalpy, ΔH, for the given process, we use the fact that for an ideal gas, enthalpy is a function of temperature only. The formula for ΔH is:

\[
\Delta H = n \cdot C_{p,m} \cdot \Delta T
\]

Here:
- \( n = 3.00 \, \text{mol} \) (number of moles),
- \( C_{p,m} \) is the molar heat capacity at constant pressure,
- \( \Delta T = T_2 - T_1 = 250 \, \text{K} - 200 \, \text{K} = 50 \, \text{K} \).

The problem gives \( C_{V,m} = 27.5 \, \text{J/K/mol} \), and using the Mayer relation \( C_{p,m} = C_{V,m} + R \), we calculate:

\[
C_{p,m} = 27.5 + 8.314 = 35.814 \, \text{J/K/mol}.
\]

Substituting into the formula for ΔH:

\[
\Delta H = 3.00 \cdot 35.814 \cdot 50 = 5372.1 \, \text{J} = 5.3721 \, \text{kJ}.
\]

Rounding to one decimal place, \( \Delta H \approx +5.4 \, \text{kJ} \).

Among the given options, the closest match is **H: +5.4 kJ**.
