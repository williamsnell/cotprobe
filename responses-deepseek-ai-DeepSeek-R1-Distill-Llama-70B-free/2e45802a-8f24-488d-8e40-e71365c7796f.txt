The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

In what ways did strategic circumstances have an effect on environmental security perspectives?

Options:

A: The end of the Cold War created the space for security policy and security studies to be re-considered in light of growing environmental consciousness underlined by multilateralism in policy action.
B: In 1973 the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) restricted oil supplies which underlined the industrial capacity of the military leaving a profound psychological impact requiring that security be linked to national interests: the securing of energy deals and the environment became related to military capability diplomacy.
C: Ideologically driven military security was replaced by a need to preserve territorial integrity in wake of the collapse of communism. Military security was a high priority given the threat of spill-over. The environment remained a peripheral concern to the security institutions occupied with the new security environment post-Cold War.
D: The end of the Cold War order created the intellectual space for the broadening of security issues beyond Cold War military mentalities. Research among political and environmental scientists discussed ways in which new security issues could be addressed. The plethora of publications produced, however, had little effect on policy.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about how strategic circumstances affected environmental security perspectives. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand the question. It's asking about the ways in which strategic circumstances influenced environmental security perspectives. So, I'm looking for an option that connects changes in the strategic environment (like political or military shifts) to how people or policies started considering environmental security.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The end of the Cold War allowed security policies to be reconsidered because of growing environmental consciousness and multilateralism. That makes sense because after the Cold War, there was a shift from military-focused security to other areas like the environment. The 90s had a lot of environmental summits and agreements, so this seems plausible.

Option B: Talks about the 1973 OPEC oil embargo and how it linked energy security to military capability. The oil crisis did make countries focus on energy security, but I'm not sure how directly that ties to environmental security. It's more about resource security than environmental issues like climate change or conservation.

Option C: Says that after the Cold War, military security remained high priority because of potential spillover threats, so the environment remained peripheral. Wait, that seems contradictory to what I thought earlier. If the Cold War ended, maybe military security became less dominant, allowing environmental issues to rise. But option C suggests the opposite, that environment was still not a focus because of new military concerns. I'm not sure about this one.

Option D: The end of the Cold War allowed security issues to broaden beyond military, leading to research but little policy effect. So, while the intellectual space opened up, policies didn't change much. This might be accurate because while there was more discussion, actual policy changes might have been slow. But I'm not certain.

So, evaluating each option:

Option A links the end of the Cold War to a shift in security policies, including environmental consciousness and multilateral actions. This fits with historical context like the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, which was shortly after the Cold War ended.

Option B is about the 1973 oil crisis. While important, it's more about energy security and economic impacts rather than environmental security specifically.

Option C suggests the environment remained peripheral, which might be the case in some areas, but I think the end of the Cold War actually allowed environmental issues to gain more attention, not less.

Option D mentions that while discussions happened, policies didn't change much. That's possible, but I'm not sure if that's the primary effect.

So, I'm leaning towards Option A because it directly ties the end of the Cold War to a shift in security perspectives that included the environment, supported by multilateral actions which were a big part of the 90s environmental policies.

The end of the Cold War created an opportunity for security policies to expand beyond traditional military concerns, allowing environmental issues to gain prominence. This period saw increased environmental consciousness and multilateral efforts, such as the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, which reflected a broader shift in security perspectives.

Answer: A
