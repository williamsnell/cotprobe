Question:

An orange grove and a vineyard are adjoining tracts of land located in a county. In 2006, a farmer purchased the orange grove, a 10-acre tract, in fee simple absolute. The vineyard, a 20-acre tract situated to the north of the orange grove, was owned by a rancher in fee simple absolute. A remote predecessor of the farmer had granted to a shepherd a way for egress and ingress across the orange grove under such terms and circumstances that an easement appurtenant to the vineyard was created. This right-of-way was executed by deed and properly recorded. The shepherd, however, never made any actual use of the right-of-way. In 2010, the rancher conveyed the vineyard to the farmer. The next year, the farmer conveyed the vineyard by deed to an investor for a consideration of $200,000, receipt of which was acknowledged. Neither the rancher farmer deed nor the farmer  investor deed contained any reference to the easement for right-of-way. The investor has now claimed that she has a right-of-way across the orange grove. The farmer, on the other hand, has informed the investor that no such easement exists. Assume that the orange grove abuts a public highway. The only access to that public highway for the vineyard is across the orange grove. If the investor initiates an appropriate action to determine her right to use the right-of-way across the orange grove, she should

Options:

A: prevail, because once an easement is properly recorded, it remains in effect ad finem until expressly released.
B: prevail, because the farmer was aware of the easement when he purchased the vineyard.
C: not prevail, because any easements were extinguished by merger when the farmer acquired a fee simple in the vineyard.
D: prevail, because the vineyard has no other access to the public highway.
E: not prevail, because the easement was never actually used by the shepherd.
F: prevail, because an easement by implication arose from the farmer's conveyance to the investor.
G: prevail, because the right-of-way was granted by a remote predecessor and not the farmer.
H: not prevail, because the farmer has the right to revoke the easement at any time.
I: not prevail, because the deed of conveyance from the farmer to the investor failed to contain any mention of the right-of-way.
J: not prevail, because the right-of-way was not included in the farmer-investor deed.

Okay, so I've got this property law question here about easements, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the setup: there's an orange grove and a vineyard next to each other. The farmer bought the orange grove in 2006, and the vineyard was owned by a rancher. A long time ago, someone (a remote predecessor of the farmer) granted a shepherd an easement appurtenant to the vineyard. This easement was for a right-of-way across the orange grove, and it was properly recorded. But the shepherd never actually used it.

Then, in 2010, the rancher sold the vineyard to the farmer. So now the farmer owns both the orange grove and the vineyard. Then, in 2011, the farmer sold the vineyard to an investor for $200k, and the deed didn't mention the easement. Now, the investor is claiming she has the right to use the right-of-way across the orange grove, but the farmer says no.

The question is whether the investor will prevail in her claim. The options are A through J, each giving a different reason.

I remember that easements can be appurtenant or in gross. Appurtenant easements benefit a particular piece of land (the dominant estate) and burden another (the servient estate). For an easement appurtenant to exist, the two parcels must be under separate ownership at the time of creation.

Here, the easement was created when the shepherd got the right-of-way across the orange grove, which was appurtenant to the vineyard. So the vineyard is the dominant estate, and the orange grove is the servient. But when the farmer bought the vineyard in 2010, he then owned both the dominant and servient estates. 

Wait, what happens when the same person owns both estates? I think that can cause the easement to be extinguished by something called "merger." Merger happens when the same person gains ownership of both the dominant and servient estates, which can terminate the easement because the necessity for the easement no longer exists. But I'm not 100% sure about the rules here.

So when the farmer bought the vineyard, he owned both properties. Then he sold the vineyard to the investor. The question is whether the easement was extinguished when he acquired both, making it so that when he sold the vineyard, the easement wasn't included anymore.

Looking at the options:

Option C says the investor won't prevail because the easements were extinguished by merger when the farmer acquired the vineyard. That sounds plausible. Because once the farmer owned both, the easement might have ended.

But wait, someone told me that merger only applies if the two estates are owned by the same person without any intervening interests. So if the farmer bought the vineyard, he now owns both, so the easement is extinguished. Then, when he sells the vineyard again, the easement isn't revived because it was already gone.

But another thought: does the merger automatically extinguish the easement, or does it just suspend it until the properties are separated again? I think it's the former; once merged, the easement is gone unless it's re-created.

So if that's the case, when the farmer sold the vineyard to the investor, the easement no longer existed because it was extinguished when the farmer acquired the vineyard. Therefore, the investor doesn't have the right-of-way.

Looking at the answer options, option C is "not prevail, because any easements were extinguished by merger when the farmer acquired a fee simple in the vineyard." That seems correct.

Other options: option A says once recorded, it's in effect until released. But merger would end it regardless. Option B says the farmer knew about it, but that doesn't matter if merger happened. Option D says because the vineyard has no other access, but that's about necessity for an easement by necessity, but the original easement was already created, so maybe that's not relevant here. Option E says because it wasn't used, but non-use doesn't extinguish an easement, only abandonment does, and that requires intent. Option F implies an easement by implication, but the original was by deed. Option G says because it was a remote predecessor; I don't think that affects it. Option H says farmer can revoke, but easements are property rights and can't be unilaterally revoked. Option I and J say because the deed didn't mention it, but once an easement is recorded, subsequent deeds don't need to mention it—it's already part of the property. So those are wrong.

So the correct answer should be C.

The question revolves around whether an easement appurtenant created for the vineyard's benefit across the orange grove survives after changes in ownership. The easement was properly recorded but never used. In 2010, the farmer acquired the vineyard, thereby owning both the dominant (vineyard) and servient (orange grove) estates. This creates a situation where the easement could be extinguished by "merger," as the same person owns both properties, eliminating the necessity for the easement. When the farmer later sold the vineyard to the investor, the easement had already been extinguished and was not revived.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. While a recorded easement generally remains in effect, merger can extinguish it regardless of recording.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The farmer's knowledge of the easement is irrelevant if it was extinguished by merger.
- **Option C**: Correct. Merger extinguished the easement when the farmer acquired both estates, so the investor cannot claim it.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The lack of alternative access might support an easement by necessity, but the original easement was already extinguished.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. Non-use does not extinguish an easement; abandonment requires intent.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. An easement by implication was not created here; the original easement was by deed.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The easement's creation by a remote predecessor does not affect its extinguishment by merger.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. Easements cannot be unilaterally revoked; they are property rights.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. A deed's failure to mention an easement does not extinguish it if it was properly recorded.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The same reasoning as Option I applies here.

The correct answer is **C**, as the easement was extinguished by merger when the farmer acquired the vineyard.
