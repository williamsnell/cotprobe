Question:

A state has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor for any person to smoke a cigarette, cigar, or pipe in any restaurant, bar, cafe, or other establishment within the state. A defendant was tried in state court for violating the anti-smoking statute. The prosecution's evidence consisted of testimony regarding the defendant's cigarette smoking at a restaurant. During the prosecution's case-in-chief, they called a witness who testified to a prior conviction of the defendant that had been excluded by the judge in a pretrial hearing. The judge immediately granted a mistrial and excused the jury. The state prosecutor appealed the ruling under a statute that permitted prosecutorial appeals in such circumstances. The state won the appeal, but the prosecutor decided not to re-prosecute the defendant. However, the city attorney from the city in which the restaurant was located then sought to prosecute the defendant for the same incident under the city's anti-smoking ordinance, which was identical to the state statute. The city attorney planned to call as her only witness a man who testified at the defendant's first trial. The defendant moved to dismiss on the grounds that the prosecution of the city charge would violate his rights against double jeopardy. The court should

Options:

A: deny the motion, because the judge granted a mistrial.
B: grant the motion, because it is the same incident being prosecuted.
C: grant the motion, because the city attorney is using the same witness.
D: deny the motion, because the first trial resulted in a mistrial.
E: grant the motion, because the law and the evidence will be identical at the second trial.
F: deny the motion, because the city's anti-smoking ordinance is separate from the state statute.
G: grant the motion, because jeopardy attached in the first prosecution.
H: deny the motion, because the city has its own jurisdiction.
I: grant the motion, because the defendant was not re-prosecuted by the state.
J: deny the motion, because the city and the state are separate sovereigns.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about double jeopardy. Hmm, I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again.

So, the situation is about a defendant who was tried in state court for violating an anti-smoking statute. During the prosecution's case, they called a witness who testified about a prior conviction that had been excluded in a pretrial hearing. The judge granted a mistrial and excused the jury. Then, the state prosecutor appealed and won, but decided not to re-prosecute. Now, the city attorney wants to prosecute the same incident under the city's identical anti-smoking ordinance. The defendant is moving to dismiss, citing double jeopardy.

The question is whether the court should grant or deny the motion. The options are A to J, each giving a different reason.

Alright, so double jeopardy is about being tried twice for the same offense after jeopardy has attached. But wait, there are some exceptions and considerations here.

First, I remember that double jeopardy doesn't just apply between the same sovereigns. So, if the state and the city are separate sovereigns, they can each prosecute. But wait, sometimes municipalities aren't considered separate sovereigns from the state. I think that depends. Like, if the city is a political subdivision of the state, then they might not be separate sovereigns.

In this case, the state and the city are prosecuting under their own laws. The state statute and the city ordinance are identical. So, the question is, are the city and state considered the same sovereign for double jeopardy purposes?

I recall the Double Jeopardy Clause applies to prevent multiple prosecutions by the same sovereign. So, if the city is part of the state government, then prosecuting in both state and city courts might be considered the same sovereign. But if the city is an independent sovereign, like a separate municipality with its own powers, then it might be allowed.

Wait, but in reality, cities derive their power from the state, so they're not separate sovereigns. So, the state and city would be considered the same sovereign, right? That would mean that if the state prosecutes and then the city prosecutes, it's the same sovereign and double jeopardy applies.

But wait, in this case, the state didn't actually prosecute to a conclusion. The first trial ended in a mistrial because of prosecutorial misconduct—introducing evidence that was excluded. So, the state prosecutor appealed the mistrial, won, but then decided not to re-prosecute. So, the first trial was a mistrial without a conviction or acquittal.

In double jeopardy, if a mistrial is granted without the defendant's consent, and it's due to prosecutorial misconduct, then double jeopardy might still bar retrial, depending on whether the prosecutor intended to provoke a mistrial. But if the mistrial is granted with the defendant's consent or because of some other reason, maybe retrial is allowed.

Wait, but in this scenario, the state is the one who appealed and won, meaning that they might have the right to retry. However, the state chose not to retry, so the first trial ended without a verdict.

Now, the city wants to prosecute the same offense. If the city is part of the same sovereign as the state, then the double jeopardy would apply, and the city can't prosecute. But if they're separate sovereigns, then it's allowed.

I think the key here is whether the city and the state are the same sovereign. Since the city is a political subdivision of the state, they are not separate sovereigns. Therefore, prosecuting the same offense in both state and city courts would be considered the same sovereign, and thus double jeopardy would apply.

Wait, but wait. There's a case where if the state prosecutes and the city prosecutes, and both are under the same sovereign, then it's double jeopardy. But I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I think that in some cases, like if a city ordinance and a state statute are for the same offense, prosecuting in both may be barred.

Alternatively, I remember the concept of dual sovereignty, where state and federal governments can each prosecute for the same act because they're separate sovereigns. But that doesn't apply between a state and its own cities because cities aren't separate sovereigns.

So, in this case, the city's prosecution would be under the same sovereign as the state. Therefore, double jeopardy would prevent the city from prosecuting again.

Wait, but let me think again. The first prosecution was by the state, which ended in a mistrial. Then the state decided not to re-prosecute. Now, the city is prosecuting under its own ordinance. Since both the state and city are within the same sovereign (the state), the city's prosecution would be barred by double jeopardy.

So, the defendant's motion should be granted because it's the same sovereign prosecuting again for the same offense. So, the court should grant the motion to dismiss.

Looking at the options:

Option B: Grant because same incident being prosecuted.

Option E: Grant because law and evidence are identical.

Option G: Grant because jeopardy attached in first prosecution.

Option J: Deny because city and state are separate sovereigns.

Wait, I thought J is incorrect because they are not separate sovereigns. So, J would be wrong. So, the correct answer would be G, because jeopardy had attached in the first prosecution, so the city can't prosecute again.

Wait, but another angle: If the first trial ended in a mistrial, does that mean that jeopardy was attached but then ended without a verdict? So, can the same sovereign retry? Typically, if a mistrial is granted without the defendant's consent and without a manifest necessity, then double jeopardy would prevent retrial. But here, the mistrial was due to prosecutorial error—the witness testified about the prior conviction that was excluded. So, was that a mistrial with prejudice?

In the case where the mistrial was due to prosecutorial misconduct, like introducing inadmissible evidence, if the prosecutor did it intentionally to provoke a mistrial, then retrial is barred. But if it was an honest mistake, then it's a question of whether manifest necessity required the mistrial.

But in this case, the judge granted a mistrial, and then the state appealed and won the right to re-prosecute, but then decided not to. So, perhaps the state could have retried, but chose not to. So, the city's attempt to prosecute would be under the same sovereign, so it's barred.

So, the defendant's double jeopardy rights would prevent the same sovereign from prosecuting again. Therefore, the court should grant the motion.

Looking at the options again:

Option G says grant because jeopardy attached. Yes, because once the jury was sworn in, jeopardy attached. So, the state's first trial had jeopardy attached, and since the city is part of the same sovereign, they can't prosecute again.

So, the correct answer is G.

The question revolves around whether the city's prosecution of the defendant under its anti-smoking ordinance violates the Double Jeopardy Clause after the state's initial prosecution ended in a mistrial. The key issue is whether the city and the state are considered the same sovereign for double jeopardy purposes.

Double jeopardy prevents a defendant from being tried twice for the same offense by the same sovereign after jeopardy has attached. In this case, jeopardy attached when the jury was sworn in during the first trial. The state's prosecution ended in a mistrial due to prosecutorial error, and although the state initially appealed and won the right to re-prosecute, it ultimately decided not to do so. Now, the city seeks to prosecute the same incident under its own ordinance, which is identical to the state statute.

Since the city is a political subdivision of the state, it is not a separate sovereign. Therefore, the city and the state are part of the same sovereign for double jeopardy purposes. This means that prosecuting the defendant again under the city's ordinance would constitute double jeopardy, as it would be the same sovereign prosecuting the same offense after jeopardy had already attached in the first trial.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option G** is correct because jeopardy attached during the first prosecution, and the city, being part of the same sovereign as the state, cannot prosecute the defendant again for the same offense.
- Other options, such as **Option J**, are incorrect because the city and state are not separate sovereigns, and thus the dual sovereignty doctrine does not apply.

The court should grant the defendant's motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds.
