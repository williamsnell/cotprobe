Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Clovis points and where they're not found. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Clovis points are a type of stone tool. They're associated with the Clovis culture, which I think was one of the earliest human cultures in the Americas. So, these points are important in archaeology for understanding early human migration.

The question is asking where Clovis points are NOT found. The options are Canada, Mexico, the continental United States, and Alaska.

Wait, so I need to figure out which of these regions doesn't have Clovis points. Let me break it down.

I know that Clovis points were widespread across North America. They're named after the town in New Mexico where they were first discovered, so the continental US definitely has them. That rules out option C.

What about Canada? I think Canada has had several Clovis finds. Maybe in the southern parts, like Alberta or Saskatchewan. So option A is probably a place where they are found, so not the answer.

Alaska is interesting. I remember that the Bering Land Bridge connected Asia and Alaska during the last ice age. Early migrants probably came through that area. But wait, I'm not sure if Clovis points are found in Alaska. I think the earliest Alaskan cultures might have had different tools or maybe the environment preserved things differently. Or perhaps the migration routes went further south.

Mexico is another option. I'm pretty sure Clovis points have been found in Mexico. There's been research showing that humans moved southward through the Americas, so Mexico would have them. So option B is out.

So that leaves option D, Alaska, as the place where Clovis points are not found. But wait, I'm a bit unsure. Did some groups stay in Alaska, or did they all move south? Maybe the climate in Alaska made it hard to find artifacts. Or perhaps the tool styles were different there because of the adaptation to the local environment.

Alternatively, maybe the initial migration through Alaska didn't use Clovis points, or maybe they were used but not found yet. But I think the general consensus is that Clovis points are found in the lower 48 states, Canada, and Mexico, but not in Alaska. Or waitâ€”another thought: maybe the earliest points in Alaska are different because the people there developed other tools suited to their needs, so Clovis points aren't common there.

Wait, another angle. Clovis culture is from around 13,500 to 12,800 years ago. The migration into the Americas might have come in waves. The initial migration might have been along the coast, so perhaps the interior of Alaska wasn't populated then. Or maybe the inland areas were covered in ice, so people moved south through the eastern parts, avoiding the icy regions.

I'm starting to lean more towards the idea that Clovis points aren't found in Alaska. So the answer would be D: Alaska.

Clovis points are associated with the Clovis culture, one of the earliest human cultures in the Americas, and are typically found across much of North America. They were first discovered in New Mexico, so the continental United States (option C) is definitely a region where they are found. Similarly, Canada (option A) has had several Clovis finds, particularly in southern regions like Alberta and Saskatchewan. Mexico (option B) also has evidence of Clovis points, as humans migrated southward through the Americas.

Alaska (option D), however, stands out as the region where Clovis points are not commonly found. While early migrants likely passed through Alaska via the Bering Land Bridge, the archaeological record suggests that the tools used in Alaska during this period were different, possibly due to adaptation to the local environment or preservation challenges. Thus, Clovis points are not typically associated with Alaska.
