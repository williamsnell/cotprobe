Question:

A toy collector had purchased 10 antique toys over the last several years and had had them restored by an expert in toy restoration. On June 1, the collector sent the 11th antique toy to the expert with a signed note that read: "Here is another toy for you to restore. As with all prior jobs, I will pay $500 for the work, but no more." On June 4, after receipt of the collector's June 1 note and the toy, the expert began restoring the toy. On June 6, the collector unexpectedly died. On June 7, unaware of the collector's death, the expert sent the collector a note that stated that the restoration work had begun on June 4. The following day, the expert learned of the collector's death. Does a contract exist that binds the expert and the collector's estate?

Options:

A: Yes, because the expert sent the June 7 note before learning of the collector's death.
B: Yes, because the previous successful contracts set a precedent for this one.
C: No, because the collector died before the expert sent the June 7 note.
D: No, because the contract was not formally written and signed.
E: No, because the expert was not aware of the collector's death before starting the restoration.
F: No, because the offer lapsed when the collector died.
G: Yes, because the expert had already accepted the work and payment terms.
H: Yes, because the offer was accepted before the collector's death.
I: No, because the collector's estate did not confirm the contract.

Okay, so I've got this contract law question here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, I remember that contract formation usually requires offer, acceptance, and consideration. So let's see what's going on in this scenario.

The collector sent the 11th toy with a note saying he'll pay $500 as with all prior jobs. So this sounds like an offer from the collector to the expert. The expert received this on June 4, right? Wait, no, the collector sent it on June 1, and the expert started restoring on June 4. So the expert began work after receiving the offer. 

Now, the collector died on June 6. Then, on June 7, the expert sent a note saying the work had begun. But the expert didn't know about the collector's death until June 8. So when did the contract form?

I think about when the acceptance happens. The expert started the work on June 4. So by beginning the restoration, did the expert accept the offer? Or was the June 7 note the acceptance? Because the offer was to pay $500 as before, which implies that the expert's action (restoring) is the acceptance. 

Wait, in contract law, acceptance can be by conduct. So if the expert started restoring the toy, that could be considered acceptance. So when the expert began on June 4, that might be the point of acceptance. But wait, the offer was made on June 1, and the expert started on June 4. So by starting, they accepted.

But then the collector died on June 6. So the expert started work on June 4, which is before the collector's death. So if the contract was formed when the expert started the work, then the contract exists even if the collector died later. Because the contract was already formed before the death.

Wait, but the note sent on June 7 was after the collector's death. But the expert didn't know that yet. So the note was sent on June 7, which is after the collector's death on June 6. So does that matter?

I think the key is when the contract was formed. If the expert accepted by starting work on June 4, then the contract was formed on June 4, before the collector died. So the estate would be bound because the contract existed before the death.

Looking at the options, option H says yes because the offer was accepted before the collector's death. That makes sense. Option F says no because the offer lapsed when the collector died. But if the acceptance happened before the death, the offer wouldn't lapse.

Option B talks about prior contracts setting a precedent, which might relate to course of dealing, but I don't think that's the main issue here. The main issue is when the acceptance happened.

So the correct answer should be H. Yes, because the offer was accepted before the collector's death.

The question revolves around contract formation, which requires an offer, acceptance, and consideration. The collector sent an offer on June 1, which the expert received. The expert began restoring the toy on June 4, which constitutes acceptance by conduct. This acceptance occurred before the collector's death on June 6, meaning the contract was already formed. The expert's note sent on June 7, after the collector's death, does not affect the contract's validity since the acceptance had already occurred. Therefore, the estate is bound by the contract.
