Okay, so I have this problem here about Good-day Tire Company wanting to find their cost per tire. Hmm, I remember that cost per unit is usually calculated by dividing the total costs by the number of units produced. Let me think.

Alright, the problem says that their expenses over the past 6 months were $820,600, and they produced 110,000 tires. So I need to find the cost per tire. That should be straightforward.

Wait, so the formula should be total expenses divided by the number of tires. So that's 820,600 divided by 110,000. Let me do that calculation step by step.

First, I can write it as 820600 ÷ 110000. Maybe I can simplify this division. Let me see, both numbers end with zeros, so I can remove some to make it easier. 820600 divided by 110000 is the same as 8206 divided by 110, because I divided numerator and denominator by 100 each.

So 8206 ÷ 110. Let me see, 110 times 7 is 770. Hmm, because 110*7=770. So subtracting 770 from 8206 gives me 8206-770=7436? Wait, no, that can't be right because 8206 is less than 770. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. 110 times 74 is... 74*100=7400, 74*10=740, so 7400+740=8140. Oh, wait, 74*110 is 8140. So 8140 is less than 8206. Then 8206 minus 8140 is 66. So the result would be 74 with a remainder of 66.

So 74 and 66/110. 66 divided by 110 is 0.6. So 74.6? Wait, no, wait, 66/110 is 0.6, so the total is 74.6. Wait, that can't be right because looking at the answer options, the highest is $9.00, and 74 is way higher. Oh wait, I think I messed up the decimal places somewhere.

Wait a second, I think I forgot that when I divided both numerator and denominator by 100, the actual division is 820600 ÷ 110000, which is the same as 8206 ÷ 110, which equals 74.6. Wait, but that's $74.6 per tire, which isn't among the options. That can't be right. Did I do something wrong here?

Oh wait, maybe I should check my division again. Let me try a different approach. Let's see, 820600 divided by 110000.

Alternatively, I can write this as (820600 ÷ 1000) / (110000 ÷ 1000) = 820.6 / 110. Now, 110 goes into 820.6 how many times?

Let me calculate 110 times 7 is 770. 110 * 7 = 770. So 770 is less than 820.6. So 7 times. Subtract 770 from 820.6 gives 50.6 left. Now, bring down a zero (since we're dealing with decimals now), making it 506.0.

110 goes into 506.0 four times because 4*110 is 440. Subtract 440 from 506, we get 66. Bring down another zero, making it 660.

110 goes into 660 exactly 6 times because 6*110=660. So now we have 7.46. So the cost per tire is $7.46.

Looking at the options, option J is $7.46. So that's the correct answer.

To calculate the cost per tire for Good-day Tire Company, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Cost per tire} = \frac{\text{Total expenses}}{\text{Number of tires produced}}
\]

Given that the total expenses are $820,600 and the number of tires produced is 110,000, the calculation becomes:

\[
\text{Cost per tire} = \frac{820,600}{110,000}
\]

Simplifying the division:

1. Divide numerator and denominator by 100:  
   \[
   \frac{8206}{110}
   \]

2. Perform the division:  
   \[
   8206 \div 110 = 74.6
   \]

However, this result is inconsistent with the answer options, so rechecking the calculation is necessary. Breaking it down further:

- \( 110 \times 7 = 770 \), subtract from 820.6:  
  \[
  820.6 - 770 = 50.6
  \]

- Bring down a zero: \( 506.0 \). \( 110 \times 4 = 440 \), subtract:  
  \[
  506 - 440 = 66
  \]

- Bring down a zero: \( 660 \). \( 110 \times 6 = 660 \), subtract:  
  \[
  660 - 660 = 0
  \]

Thus, the cost per tire is:

\[
7.46
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**J: $7.46**
