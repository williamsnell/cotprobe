Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I need to figure out the phenotypic results of crossing two pea plants. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem states that in peas, tall (D) is dominant over dwarf (d), and yellow cotyledons (G) are dominant over green (g). So, we're dealing with two traits here, each with two alleles.

The parents are a tall, heterozygous pea plant with green cotyledons and a dwarf pea plant that's heterozygous for yellow cotyledons. Wait, let's get their genotypes clear.

The first parent is tall and heterozygous. Since tall is dominant (D), and it's heterozygous, that means its genotype for the height gene is Dd. Oh wait, but wait, the cotyledon trait: the plant has green cotyledons. Green is recessive (g), right? So for the cotyledon trait, since the plant is green, it must be homozygous recessive. So gg. So the first parent's genotype is Ddgg.

The second parent is a dwarf plant. Dwarf is recessive (d), so its genotype for the height gene is dd. And it's heterozygous for yellow cotyledons. Yellow is dominant (G), so the genotype is Gg. So the second parent is ddGg.

Now, we need to cross these two. Let's do a Punnett square maybe, or at least figure out the gametes each parent can produce.

Starting with the first parent (Ddgg). Let's separate the two traits.

For the Dd gene (height), gametes can be D or d, each with 50% chance.

For the gg gene (cotyledon), since it's homozygous, gametes will all be g.

So the gametes from the first parent are Dg and dg, but wait no, wait—each gamete has one allele for each gene. Oh wait, for two genes, the gametes are combinations of alleles. So for Dd and gg, the gametes would be:

D from Dd, and g from gg. So Dg.

Wait, but wait, no, the plant has Dd for height and gg for cotyledon. So the possible gametes for each gene are:

Height: 50% D, 50% d.

Cotyledon: 100% g.

So the gametes are Dg and dg. Each with 50% chance.

Now the second parent is ddGg.

Height gene: dd, so can only produce d gametes.

Cotyledon gene: Gg, so can produce G or g gametes, 50% each.

So gametes from the second parent are dG and dg, each 50%.

Now, let's set up the Punnett square.

Parent 1 gametes: Dg (50%) and dg (50%).

Parent 2 gametes: dG (50%) and dg (50%).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think of all possible combinations.

Each gamete from parent 1 can combine with each of parent 2's gametes.

So possible combinations:

Dg (P1) + dG (P2) → Dd Gg

Dg (P1) + dg (P2) → Dd gg

dg (P1) + dG (P2) → dd Gg

dg (P1) + dg (P2) → dd gg

Wait, but let me formalize this:

The possible combinations would be:

1. Dg x dG → Dd (for height) and Gg (cotyledon)
2. Dg x dg → Dd and gg
3. dg x dG → dd and Gg
4. dg x dg → dd and gg

Each of these four possibilities is equally likely, so 25% each.

Now, let's figure out the phenotypes for each.

1. Dd Gg: For height, D is dominant, so tall. For cotyledon, G is dominant, so yellow.
2. Dd gg: D is dominant (tall), gg is recessive (green).
3. dd Gg: dd is recessive (dwarf), Gg is yellow (dominant).
4. dd gg: dwarf, green.

So the four possible phenotypic outcomes are:

- Tall, yellow
- Tall, green
- Dwarf, yellow
- Dwarf, green

Each with 25% chance.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the probabilities. Because each gamete combination is 25% chance, so each of these four phenotypes would be 25% each. So the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, each 25%.

Looking at the options, option F is:

F: (1/4) tall, yellow; (1/4) tall, green; (1/4) dwarf, yellow; (1/4) dwarf, green

So that would be F.

But wait, I should make sure. Alternatively, maybe the parents aren't Ddgg and ddGg.

Wait, the first parent is tall and heterozygous, which is Dd. But for cotyledon, green (g), and since it's homozygous, gg. So yes, Ddgg.

The second parent is dwarf (dd) and heterozygous for yellow cotyledons (Gg), so ddGg. So that's correct.

So the cross is Ddgg × ddGg.

Another approach could be to consider each trait separately, using the multiplication principle.

For height:

Parent 1: Dd × parent 2: dd.

Dd × dd: The possible offspring genotypes are Dd (50%) and dd (50%).

So for height:

50% Dd (tall), 50% dd (dwarf).

For cotyledons:

Parent 1: gg × parent 2: Gg.

gg × Gg → all offspring will be Gg? Wait, no.

Wait, parent 1's gametes are all g (since gg) and parent 2's gametes are G and g.

So the offspring for cotyledon will be Gg (when parent 1's gamete g combines with parent 2's G) or gg (when g combines with g).

So 50% Gg and 50% gg.

So for cotyledon:

50% Gg (yellow) and 50% gg (green).

So, combining both traits, the four possible phenotypes are:

Tall, yellow (Dd and Gg)

Tall, green (Dd and gg)

Dwarf, yellow (dd and Gg)

Dwarf, green (dd and gg)

Each occurs 25% of the time.

So the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, each 25%.

Looking again at the options, F is the one that matches.

In peas, tall (D) is dominant to dwarf (d), and yellow cotyledons (G) are dominant to green (g). The first parent is tall and heterozygous with green cotyledons, so its genotype is **Ddgg**. The second parent is dwarf and heterozygous for yellow cotyledons, so its genotype is **ddGg**. To determine the phenotypic results of their progeny, we analyze the gametes produced by each parent.

### Gametes:
1. **Parent 1 (Ddgg):**
   - Height: 50% **D**, 50% **d**
   - Cotyledons: 100% **g**
   - Possible gametes: **Dg** (50%) and **dg** (50%).

2. **Parent 2 (ddGg):**
   - Height: 100% **d**
   - Cotyledons: 50% **G**, 50% **g**
   - Possible gametes: **dG** (50%) and **dg** (50%).

### Punnett Square:
Combining the gametes from both parents, the following offspring genotypes are possible:
1. **Dd Gg**: Tall, yellow
2. **Dd gg**: Tall, green
3. **dd Gg**: Dwarf, yellow
4. **dd gg**: Dwarf, green

Each of these genotypes occurs with equal probability (25%).

### Phenotypic Results:
- **Tall, yellow**: 25%  
- **Tall, green**: 25%  
- **Dwarf, yellow**: 25%  
- **Dwarf, green**: 25%  

This matches option **F**, which states:  
**(1/4) tall, yellow; (1/4) tall, green; (1/4) dwarf, yellow; (1/4) dwarf, green**.

ANSWER: F
