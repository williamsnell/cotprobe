Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what "acts jure gestionis" means. I remember from my international law class that there's a distinction between acts done by the state in a public capacity (jure imperii) and those done in a private capacity (jure gestionis). 

Wait, jure imperii refers to sovereign acts, like making laws or enforcing them, right? And jure gestionis is when the state acts like a private entity, doing things that any person or company might do. So, for example, if the government buys supplies or enters into a contract, that's probably jure gestionis.

Looking at the options:

Option A says all state actions in public capacity are jure gestionis. That doesn't sound right because public capacity would be jure imperii.

Option B talks about government officials in their free time. I don't think it's about the officials' personal actions, but rather the state's actions.

Option C states jure gestionis are state actions in a private capacity. That matches what I was thinking. So C seems correct.

Option D mentions international treaties. Treaties are definitely sovereign acts, so jure imperii, not jure gestionis.

Option E is about court decisions. Courts are part of the judiciary, which is a public function, so probably jure imperii.

Option F is legislative decisions, again a public function.

Option G says all purchases by the state are jure gestionis. Purchasing goods might be a private act, but does it apply to all purchases? Maybe most, but not sure if 'all' is correct. But I'm leaning towards C being the correct definition.

Option H is diplomatic missions. That's a sovereign function, so jure imperii.

Option I is military actions, definitely jure imperii.

Option J says all acts by state corporations are jure gestionis. Well, state corporations might perform both types of acts. For example, a state railway might buy trains (jure gestionis) but also have regulatory roles (jure imperii). So J is probably incorrect.

So the best answer seems to be option C.

The correct answer is:

C: Acts jure gestionis are those undertaken by States in a private capacity.

This is because acts jure gestionis refer to actions taken by the state in a private capacity, akin to those of a private individual or entity, such as entering into contracts or making purchases. In contrast, acts jure imperii involve sovereign or public functions, such as legislative decisions or diplomatic missions.

Answer: C
