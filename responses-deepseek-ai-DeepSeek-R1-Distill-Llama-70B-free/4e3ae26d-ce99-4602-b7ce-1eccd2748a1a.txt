Question:

Find the quotient of 16.1 รท 0.14.

Options:

A: 0.115
B: 0.00115
C: 0.1150
D: 115
E: 1150
F: 1.15

H: 11.50
I: 11.5
J: 1.150

Answer:
    <think>


To find the quotient of \( 16.1 \div 0.14 \), we can simplify the division by eliminating the decimal in the divisor. 

First, multiply both the dividend and the divisor by 100 to convert \( 0.14 \) into a whole number:
\[
16.1 \div 0.14 = \frac{16.1 \times 100}{0.14 \times 100} = \frac{1610}{14}
\]

Next, perform the division:
\[
\frac{1610}{14} = 115
\]

Thus, the quotient is \( 115 \).

From the given options:
- **D: 115** is the correct answer.
