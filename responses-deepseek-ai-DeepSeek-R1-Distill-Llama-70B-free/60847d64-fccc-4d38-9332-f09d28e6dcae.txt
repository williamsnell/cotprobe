Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I need to figure out the correct symbolization of the given sentence. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The sentence is: "Either England's importing beef is a sufficient condition for France's subsidizing agriculture or China's promoting human rights is a necessary condition for South Africa's supplying diamonds."

Hmm, first I need to understand what each part means in terms of logical connectives. Let's parse the sentence into two parts connected by 'or', which in logic is the disjunction symbol ∨.

The first part is: "England's importing beef is a sufficient condition for France's subsidizing agriculture." So, if England imports beef (let's call this E), then France subsidizes agriculture (let's call this F). In logic, a sufficient condition A for B is represented as A → B. So this part would be E → F.

Wait, no, actually, I think I might have that backwards. Let me think. A sufficient condition means if A happens, then B must happen. So yes, A is sufficient for B translates to A → B. So England importing beef (E) being sufficient for France's action (F) would be E → F.

The second part is: "China's promoting human rights is a necessary condition for South Africa's supplying diamonds." A necessary condition means that for B to happen, A must happen. In logic, a necessary condition for B is A ← B, which is the same as B → A. So if South Africa supplying diamonds (let's say S) requires China promoting human rights (C), then S → C.

Putting it all together, the entire sentence is an OR between these two conditions. So the structure is (E → F) ∨ (S → C).

Now I need to look at the answer options to see which one matches this structure.

Let me list what each option is:

A: (F ⊃ E) ∨ (S ⊃ C)
B: (F ⊃ E) ∨ (C ⊃ S)
C: (F ⊃ C) ∨ (E ⊃ S)
D: (S ⊃ E) ∨ (F ⊃ C)
E: (E ⊃ F) ∨ (C ⊃ S)
F: (E ⊃ S) ∨ (C ⊃ F)
G: (E ⊃ F) ∨ (S ⊃ C)
H: (C ⊃ F) ∨ (S ⊃ E)
I: (S ⊃ F) ∨ (E ⊃ C)
J: (C ⊃ S) ∨ (F ⊃ E)

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Because in the second condition, the necessary condition is China promoting human rights (C) for South Africa supplying diamonds (S). So as a necessary condition, it's S → C, which is option E's second part, (C ⊃ S) is the converse, so that's not right. Wait no, actually, let me clarify.

Wait no, S → C is the same as C being a necessary condition for S. So the correct implication is S → C, which is written as (S ⊃ C). So the second part should be (S → C), which is (S ⊃ C).

Looking at the options, which ones have (E → F) as the first part and (S → C) as the second part, connected by ∨?

Looking at option G: (E ⊃ F) ∨ (S ⊃ C). Yes, that's exactly what we derived. So the correct formula is option G.

Wait, but let me double-check the other options to make sure. Option E is (E ⊃ F) ∨ (C ⊃ S). That would mean E→F OR C→S, which is different because the second part should be S→C, not C→S.

Option G is (E→F) OR (S→C), which matches our analysis. So the correct answer should be G.

The sentence to symbolize is: "Either England's importing beef is a sufficient condition for France's subsidizing agriculture or China's promoting human rights is a necessary condition for South Africa's supplying diamonds."

1. **First Part**: "England's importing beef is a sufficient condition for France's subsidizing agriculture."  
   - Let E = England's importing beef.  
   - Let F = France's subsidizing agriculture.  
   - A sufficient condition translates to E → F.

2. **Second Part**: "China's promoting human rights is a necessary condition for South Africa's supplying diamonds."  
   - Let C = China's promoting human rights.  
   - Let S = South Africa's supplying diamonds.  
   - A necessary condition translates to S → C.

3. **Combining the Two Parts**: The sentence is an OR (∨) connecting the two conditions: (E → F) ∨ (S → C).

4. **Matching with Options**:  
   - Option G matches the derived formula: (E ⊃ F) ∨ (S ⊃ C).

Thus, the correct answer is **G**.

G
