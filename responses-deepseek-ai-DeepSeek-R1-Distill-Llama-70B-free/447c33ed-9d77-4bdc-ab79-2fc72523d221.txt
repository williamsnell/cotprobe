Okay, so I've got this question about nearsightedness, which I think is also called myopia. I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but I'll try to think it through.

From what I remember, the eye has parts like the cornea, lens, retina, and others. Nearsightedness is when you can see things up close clearly, but distant objects are blurry. So, what causes that?

I think it has to do with the shape of the eye. Maybe the eyeball is too long or too short. Oh wait, if the eyeball is too long, the light might focus in front of the retina instead of directly on it. That would make distant objects seem blurry because the focus isn't right.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the curvature of the cornea or lens. The cornea and lens bend the light as it enters the eye. If they're too curved, maybe that changes where the light focuses. So, if the cornea or lens is too curved, the focal point moves forward, leading to the same issue.

Wait, so nearsightedness is when the eye is longer than normal, or the cornea is too steep. Both could cause the light to focus before reaching the retina. So, the problem is that there's too much curvature in the cornea and lens. Or wait, is it just one of them? Or maybe the overall shape of the eye?

Looking at the options, option C says "too much curvature of the cornea and lens." Another thought: if the cornea is more curved, it bends light more, making the focal point closer. So that would cause the image to form before the retina, hence myopia.

Wait, but I also remember that myopia can be due to the eyeball being longer. But the question is about the curvature. So the question is about the cornea and lens having too much curvature. So the correct answer would relate to that.

Looking at the options again:

Option C is "too much curvature of the cornea and lens." That sounds right. Because if both are too curved, the light bends more, focusing too early.

Other options like E are about incorrect alignment, but I think that's more about other issues like astigmatism, which is from irregular curvature causing multiple focal points.

So I'm leaning towards option C as the correct answer.

Nearsightedness, or myopia, occurs when light entering the eye focuses in front of the retina rather than directly on it. This can happen due to an eyeball that is too long or excessive curvature of the cornea and lens, which causes the light to bend too much and focus prematurely. Among the options provided, the one that accurately describes this condition is "too much curvature of the cornea and lens."

Answer: C
