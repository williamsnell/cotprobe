Question:

A 19-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because, she says, "I'm burning up." Medical history is significant for intravenous drug use. Physical examination discloses a systolic heart murmur over the precordium. An expected physical finding will be which of the following?

Options:

A: Decreased intensity of the murmur with deep inspiration
B: Increased intensity of the murmur with forced expiration
C: Increased intensity of S1
D: Decreased intensity of the murmur with forced expiration
E: Positive JVP (rise in jugular venous pulse) with expiration
F: No change in the intensity of the murmur with breathing changes
G: Positive Kussmaul sign (rise in jugular venous pulse with inspiration)
H: Increased intensity of the murmur with deep inspiration
I: Negative Kussmaul sign (no rise in jugular venous pulse with inspiration)
J: Decreased intensity of S1

Okay, so I'm looking at this medical question, and I need to figure it out. Let's break it down step by step.

The patient is a 19-year-old woman who comes to the emergency department saying she's burning up, which probably means she's feeling feverish. Her medical history is significant for intravenous drug use. That makes me think of potential complications related to IV drug use, like endocarditis or infections from unsterile needles.

On physical examination, there's a systolic heart murmur over the precordium. Systolic murmurs occur during systole, the contraction phase of the heart. The location is the precordium, which is the area over the heart and lower chest.

So, thinking about heart murmurs, common causes include valvular problems. In someone with a history of IV drug use, infective endocarditis is a high suspicion. Endocarditis often affects the heart valves, causing murmurs. The most commonly affected valve is the tricuspid, followed by the mitral and aortic.

Tricuspid valve issues can lead to specific physical findings. For example, in tricuspid regurgitation, blood flows back from the right ventricle into the right atrium during systole. So, the murmur would be systolic.

Now, the question is about the expected physical finding. The options are various changes in heart sounds with breathing or other maneuvers.

I remember that certain murmurs change with respiration due to changes in intrathoracic pressure affecting venous return. For example, in tricuspid regurgitation, inspiration increases venous return to the right heart, which can increase the intensity of the murmur. Because when you inhale, intrathoracic pressure decreases, so blood is drawn into the thoracic veins, increasing right-sided preload. This would make the tricuspid regurgitation murmur louder.

Wait, but let me think again. The classic association is that in tricuspid valve disease, the murmur intensity increases with inspiration. So, during inspiration, the murmur becomes louder. That would mean that when the patient takes a deep breath in, the murmur's intensity increases.

Looking at the options:

Option H says increased intensity with deep inspiration. That fits with tricuspid regurgitation.

Other options: Let's see. Options A and D are about decreased intensity with inspiration or expiration. If the murmur increases with inspiration, those wouldn't apply.

Options B, E, G, I, J, F, etc. E is about JVP with expiration, G is Kussmaul's sign which is about JVP rising with inspiration. Kussmaul's is typically associated with constrictive pericarditis or right heart failure, where inspiration causes increased venous return and thus JVD becomes more prominent. But the question is about the murmur, not JVP.

So the question is which change in murmur intensity occurs with breathing. So if it's tricuspid regurgitation, the murmur increases with inspiration. So option H would be correct.

Wait, what about the other options related to S1? Option C says increased intensity of S1. S1 is the first heart sound, due to closing of the mitral and tricuspid valves. In conditions where there's increased flow across the valve, like in mitral stenosis, S1 might be louder. But in tricuspid regurgitation, I'm not sure if S1 is affected. Alternatively, in mitral valve prolapse, S1 can be normal, but that's a different situation. So maybe C and J aren't the right choices.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be H: increased intensity of the murmur with deep inspiration.

The patient is a 19-year-old woman with a history of intravenous drug use, presenting with fever and a systolic heart murmur over the precordium. This clinical picture raises suspicion for infective endocarditis, particularly involving the tricuspid valve, as IV drug use is a risk factor for right-sided endocarditis. Tricuspid regurgitation, a common complication, results in a systolic murmur that classically increases in intensity with deep inspiration due to increased venous return to the right heart during inhalation.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option H** correctly describes the expected finding of increased murmur intensity with deep inspiration, consistent with tricuspid regurgitation.
- Other options (A, B, D, E, F, G, I, J) do not align with the typical presentation of tricuspid regurgitation or are unrelated to the murmur's behavior with respiration.

Thus, the correct answer is:

H: Increased intensity of the murmur with deep inspiration.

Answer: H
