Okay, so I've got this question about the rib and the intercostal nerve. Hmm, I remember that the intercostal nerves are related to the ribs, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me try to think it through.

I know that each intercostal nerve runs along a rib, right? But where exactly? So, the question is asking about the position of the intercostal nerve in relation to the rib. The options are about the position relative to the rib's borders—superior, inferior, medial, lateral—and whether it's deep or superficial to that border.

Wait, I think the intercostal nerves are located just below the ribs. Oh wait, no, each nerve is associated with the space between two ribs, the intercostal space. So the nerve runs along the lower edge of the rib? Or the upper edge?

I remember something about the nerve being protected by the rib. So maybe it's located along the inferior border. Or was it the superior? Another thought: the intercostal vessels (artery and veins) are along the costal groove of the rib. So the nerve is usually near the artery and vein.

Wait, the structure of the intercostal space: each has three muscles—the external, internal, and innermost intercostals. The intercostal nerve runs between the internal and innermost layers. But where is that in relation to the rib?

Oh! I think the intercostal nerve lies in the costal groove, which is on the inferior aspect of the rib. So the rib has a groove along its lower border, and the nerve and vessels lie there. So if the groove is on the inferior border, then the nerve is deep to that, right?

But wait, when you say "deep to" the border, that would mean it's below the inferior border? Or maybe the nerve is within the groove, which is on the inferior side. So from the perspective of the rib, the nerve is along its inferior border, in the groove.

So the question is asking where the intercostal nerve lies relative to the rib. So the options are about medial or lateral to the borders or deep/superficial.

Wait, the options: for example, option A is medial to its inferior border. So the inferior border is the lower edge. Medial would be towards the midline of the body. Hmm, but the intercostal nerve runs along the length of the rib, so it's not medial or lateral to the border, but rather along the border itself. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps I got the position wrong. Let me visualize the rib. The rib has a superior and inferior border. The intercostal nerve runs along the inferior border, in the costal groove. So the nerve is located along the inferior border, deep within the groove. So looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is that the intercostal nerve is deep to the inferior border.

Wait, but what do the options say? Let me check the options:

Option A: medial to its inferior border. So, on the inner side of the lower edge.

Option B: medial to superior border.

Option C: lateral to inferior.

Option D: deep to lateral border.

Option E: superficial to lateral.

Option F: deep to superior.

Option G: lateral to superior.

Option H: superficial to superior.

Option I: superficial to inferior.

Option J: deep to inferior.

So, if the nerve is in the costal groove, which is along the inferior border, then the position is deep to the inferior border. Because the groove is a channel on the lower side, and the nerve is inside that channel, so it's deep relative to the inferior border. So that would be option J.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the terminology here. Let me think again. The rib's inferior border is the lower edge. The costal groove is on the inner surface of the rib, running along the inferior border. So when the question says the corresponding intercostal nerve lies where relative to the rib, the nerve is in the groove, which is along the inferior border. So the nerve is deep to the inferior border, because the groove is a depression, so the nerve is inside that depression. So the position is deep to the inferior border.

So looking at the options, that's option J: deep to its inferior border.

The intercostal nerve is located in the costal groove, which runs along the inferior border of the rib. This groove is a depression on the inner surface of the rib, and the nerve lies within this channel. Since the groove is situated along the inferior border, the nerve is considered deep to the inferior border of the rib. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The nerve is not medial to the inferior border but rather along it.
- **B**: Incorrect. The nerve is not related to the superior border in this context.
- **C**: Incorrect. The nerve is not lateral to the inferior border.
- **D**: Incorrect. The nerve is not deep to the lateral border.
- **E**: Incorrect. The nerve is not superficial to the lateral border.
- **F**: Incorrect. The nerve is not deep to the superior border.
- **G**: Incorrect. The nerve is not lateral to the superior border.
- **H**: Incorrect. The nerve is not superficial to the superior border.
- **I**: Incorrect. The nerve is not superficial to the inferior border.
- **J**: Correct. The nerve is deep to the inferior border, as it lies within the costal groove.

Thus, the correct answer is:

J
