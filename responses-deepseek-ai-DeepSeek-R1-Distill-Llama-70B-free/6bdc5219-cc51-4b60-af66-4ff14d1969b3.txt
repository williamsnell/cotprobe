Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and charge distributions. Hmm, let me think. The question says that there's a spherical charge distribution where the volume charge density rho is given by rho equals a times r. Oh wait, and a is a positive constant. The distribution goes out to radius R. I need to find out what's true about the electric field strength E at a distance r from the center.

I remember that for charge distributions, especially spherical ones, Gauss's Law is super useful. Gauss's Law says that the electric flux through a closed surface is equal to the charge enclosed divided by the permittivity of free space. The formula is Φ = Q_enclosed / ε₀. And the flux is E times the area of the Gaussian surface when the field is uniform and perpendicular, which is the case for a sphere.

So, the first thing I should do is figure out the charge enclosed for two cases: when r is less than R (inside the distribution) and when r is greater than R (outside).

Starting with r < R: the charge enclosed is the integral of rho dV from 0 to r. Since rho is a function of r, I need to integrate a*r over the volume. The volume element in spherical coordinates is 4πr² dr, right? So the integral becomes ∫ (a r) * 4π r² dr from 0 to r. That's a*4π ∫ r^3 dr from 0 to r. The integral of r^3 is r^4/4, so plugging in, Q_enclosed = a*4π (r^4/4) = a π r^4.

Wait wait, let me check the integration. Oh wait, no, the integral of r^3 dr is (r^4)/4. So a times 4π times (r^4/4) would be a π r^4. That seems right.

Then, using Gauss's Law, Φ = E * 4π r² = Q_enclosed / ε₀. So E = Q_enclosed/(ε₀ 4π r²). Plugging in Q_enclosed, E becomes (a π r^4) / (ε₀ 4 π r²) ). The pi cancels, and r^4/r² is r². So E = (a r²) / (4 ε₀). Oh wait, no, wait. Let me compute that again. Q_enclosed is a π r^4. So E = (a π r^4) / (ε₀ 4 π r²) ) = (a r^4) / (4 ε₀ r²) ) = (a r²) / (4 ε₀). So E is proportional to r squared inside the sphere. That means as r increases inside the sphere, E increases with r squared. So inside the sphere, E increases as r increases. So for r < R, E is increasing, but not linearly. It's proportional to r², so it's a nonlinear increase. So for r < R, E increases non-linearly.

Now what about when r is greater than R? Then the entire charge is enclosed, so Q_total is the integral from 0 to R. So Q_total = a π R^4. So when r > R, E is given by E = (Q_total)/(4 π ε₀ r²). Since Q_total is a constant once R is fixed, E decreases with 1/r² for r > R. So as r increases beyond R, E decreases, following an inverse square law.

Looking at the options now. Let me go through each.

Option A: It increases as r approaches infinity. Well, for r > R, E decreases as 1/r², so as r approaches infinity, E approaches zero. So A is wrong.

Option B: It increases exponentially for r > R. No, because E decreases with 1/r². So B is incorrect.

Option C: It increases linearly for r > R. No, because it's decreasing. So C is wrong.

Option D: It decreases non-linearly for r < R. Wait, wait, no. For r < R, E increases. So D is about r < R. D says it decreases, which is not right. So D is incorrect.

Option E: It decreases exponentially for r < R. No, for r < R, E increases. So E is incorrect.

Option F: It increases non-linearly for r < R. Yes, because E is proportional to r², which is a nonlinear increase. So F seems correct.

Option G: It decreases linearly for r > R. No, it decreases as 1/r², so it's a nonlinear decrease. So G is incorrect.

Option H: It remains constant for r < R. No, because E increases with r². So H is wrong.

Option I: It remains constant for r > R. No, E decreases with 1/r², so I is wrong.

So the correct answer should be F: It increases non-linearly for r < R.

Wait, but let me double-check. The options are:

F: It increases non-linearly for r < R.

Yes. Because for r < R, E is proportional to r squared, which is a nonlinear relationship. So the electric field strength increases as r increases, but not linearly, so F is true.

Looking at the other options, let me make sure. For r > R, E is (a π R^4)/(4 ε₀ r²). So as r increases beyond R, E decreases as 1/r², so it's a nonlinear decrease. But none of the options say that except perhaps G and I, which are incorrect. 

So the correct option is F.

To analyze the electric field \( E \) due to a spherical charge distribution where the volume charge density is given by \( \rho = ar \) (with \( a > 0 \)) and the distribution extends to a radius \( R \), we use **Gauss's Law**. The electric flux through a Gaussian surface is related to the enclosed charge \( Q_{\text{enc}} \) by:

\[
\Phi = E \cdot 4\pi r^2 = \frac{Q_{\text{enc}}}{\epsilon_0}.
\]

### Case 1: \( r < R \) (Inside the sphere)
The enclosed charge \( Q_{\text{enc}} \) is obtained by integrating \( \rho \) over the volume of the sphere of radius \( r \):
\[
Q_{\text{enc}} = \int_0^r \rho \, dV = \int_0^r (ar) \cdot 4\pi r^2 \, dr = 4\pi a \int_0^r r^3 \, dr = 4\pi a \left[\frac{r^4}{4}\right]_0^r = \pi a r^4.
\]

Using Gauss's Law, the electric field becomes:
\[
E = \frac{Q_{\text{enc}}}{4\pi \epsilon_0 r^2} = \frac{\pi a r^4}{4\pi \epsilon_0 r^2} = \frac{a r^2}{4\epsilon_0}.
\]

Thus, for \( r < R \), \( E \) is proportional to \( r^2 \), meaning the electric field increases **non-linearly** as \( r \) increases.

### Case 2: \( r > R \) (Outside the sphere)
For \( r > R \), the entire charge is enclosed, so \( Q_{\text{total}} \) is:
\[
Q_{\text{total}} = \int_0^R \rho \, dV = \pi a R^4.
\]

Using Gauss's Law, the electric field becomes:
\[
E = \frac{Q_{\text{total}}}{4\pi \epsilon_0 r^2} = \frac{\pi a R^4}{4\pi \epsilon_0 r^2} = \frac{a R^4}{4\epsilon_0 r^2}.
\]

Thus, for \( r > R \), \( E \) decreases as \( 1/r^2 \), following an inverse-square law.

### Analysis of the Options
- **A**: Incorrect. For \( r > R \), \( E \) decreases as \( 1/r^2 \), so it does not increase as \( r \to \infty \).
- **B**: Incorrect. For \( r > R \), \( E \) decreases as \( 1/r^2 \), not exponentially.
- **C**: Incorrect. For \( r > R \), \( E \) decreases, not increases.
- **D**: Incorrect. For \( r < R \), \( E \) increases, not decreases.
- **E**: Incorrect. For \( r < R \), \( E \) increases, not decreases.
- **F**: Correct. For \( r < R \), \( E \) increases non-linearly with \( r^2 \).
- **G**: Incorrect. For \( r > R \), \( E \) decreases as \( 1/r^2 \), not linearly.
- **H**: Incorrect. For \( r < R \), \( E \) increases with \( r^2 \), so it is not constant.
- **I**: Incorrect. For \( r > R \), \( E \) decreases as \( 1/r^2 \), so it is not constant.

### Final Answer
The correct option is **F**: It increases non-linearly for \( r < R \).
