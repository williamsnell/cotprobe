Question:

Ms. Susan Wane and Ms. Dolly Watson invested $35,000 and $20,000 respectively, in a corkscrew factory. They decided to share the profits equally, after each receives 8% interest on her investment. Show the distribution of income if the business earns $24,200.

Options:

B: Ms. Wane receives $14,700 and Ms. Watson receives $9,500
C: Ms. Wane receives $12,500 and Ms. Watson receives $11,700
D: Ms. Wane receives $12,700 and Ms. Watson receives $11,500

Okay, so I've got this problem about Susan and Dolly investing in a corkscrew factory. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

First, Susan invested $35,000 and Dolly $20,000. They're sharing profits equally, but first each gets 8% interest on their investment. The total earnings are $24,200. I need to determine how this is split between them.

Hmm, let's break it down. The 8% interest comes first. So I'll calculate each person's interest.

Susan's interest: 8% of 35,000. Let me calculate that. 0.08 * 35,000 equals... 0.08 times 35 is 2.8, so 2.8 * 1000 is $2,800.

Dolly's interest: 8% of 20,000. 0.08 * 20,000 is 1,600. So that's $1,600.

Wait, but how does this affect the profit sharing? I think the total interest they get before sharing is $2,800 and $1,600 respectively. But the problem says they share the profits equally after each receives 8% interest. Oh, wait, the profit is $24,200. So the 8% is part of that profit distribution.

Wait, maybe the $24,200 is the total profit before any distributions. So first, each gets their 8% interest, and then the remaining profit is split equally.

Wait, that makes sense. So the 8% is a return on investment, and then the remaining profit is split equally.

So the total interest to be paid out is Susan's $2,800 and Dolly's $1,600. That adds up to 4,400. So total interest is 4,400.

Now, subtract that from the total profit to find the remaining profit to split equally. So 24,200 minus 4,400 equals 19,800. 

Wait, no, wait a second. Let me think again. Are they each taking out their 8% as a first step, and then the remaining is split equally? Or is the 8% part of their share?

No, the question says they share the profits equally after each receives 8% interest. So the 8% is a guaranteed return, and the remaining is split equally.

So the total business earns 24,200. First, each gets their 8% interest, which is 2,800 and 1,600. So that's 4,400 in total. The remaining profit is 24,200 - 4,400 = 19,800.

Now, this remaining 19,800 is split equally between them. So each gets half of that. 19,800 divided by 2 is 9,900.

So now, let's compute each person's total.

Susan gets her 8% (2,800) plus half of the remaining (9,900), which totals 12,700.

Dolly gets her 8% (1,600) plus half (9,900), which is 11,500.

So Susan gets 12,700 and Dolly gets 11,500.

Looking at the options, option D says exactly that: Ms. Wane (Susan) receives $12,700 and Ms. Watson (Dolly) receives $11,500.

To determine the distribution of income, we start by calculating the 8% interest on each investment:

- **Susan's interest**: \( 0.08 \times 35,000 = 2,800 \)
- **Dolly's interest**: \( 0.08 \times 20,000 = 1,600 \)

The total interest paid out is \( 2,800 + 1,600 = 4,400 \). Subtracting this from the total profit of $24,200 gives the remaining profit to be split equally:

\[
24,200 - 4,400 = 19,800
\]

This remaining profit is split equally between Susan and Dolly:

\[
19,800 \div 2 = 9,900
\]

Adding the 8% interest to their respective shares:

- **Susan's total**: \( 2,800 + 9,900 = 12,700 \)
- **Dolly's total**: \( 1,600 + 9,900 = 11,500 \)

Thus, Ms. Wane receives $12,700 and Ms. Watson receives $11,500.
