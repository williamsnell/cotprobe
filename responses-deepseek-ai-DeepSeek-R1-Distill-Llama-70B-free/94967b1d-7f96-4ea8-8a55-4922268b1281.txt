Okay, so I've got this question here about which function declines the most with age. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my psychology, but let me think through this.

The options are A through J. Let me go through each one and see what I remember about how aging affects different abilities.

Option A is physical strength. I know that as people age, their muscles mass decreases, which would make sense that physical strength declines. But I'm not sure if it's the most significant compared to other functions.

Option B is the ability to learn new languages. I remember something about it being harder for adults to learn new languages than children, but I think it's more about the brain's plasticity and not necessarily a steep decline. Adults can still learn, just maybe not as quickly.

Option C is the ability to process information rapidly. Processing speed does slow down with age. I think this is a well-known cognitive change, where older adults might take longer to react or make decisions. But is it the most significant decline?

Option D is attention span. I'm not too sure about this. I think attention can be affected, but maybe it's more about the ability to focus amidst distractions rather than a significant decline in the span itself.

Option E is taste and smell sensitivity. Oh right, the senses do decline with age. Taste and smell can diminish, which is why older people might use more spices or salt. But compared to cognitive functions, I'm not sure if this is the biggest decline.

Option F is the ability to multitask. Multitasking is related to executive functions, which do decline. But again, is it the most significant? I think some cognitive functions decline more sharply.

Option G is crystallized intelligence. From what I remember, crystallized intelligence is the accumulated knowledge and skills, which actually stays stable or even increases with age. So this probably doesn't decline much.

Option H is implicit memory. Implicit memory is the unconscious type, like skills and habits. I think this remains more intact compared to explicit memory. So maybe it doesn't decline as much.

Option I is short-term memory. Short-term memory capacity does decrease with age. Older adults might have more trouble remembering recent events or details, which is a common complaint.

Option J is visual acuity. Vision does decline, with presbyopia and other issues, but again, not sure if it's the biggest decline.

Now, considering all of this. Physical strength (A) definitely declines, but the question is about functions. Processing speed (C) is a big one in cognitive aging. I've read that processing speed is a major factor that affects other cognitive tasks. The speed at which we can process information slows down, which in turn affects things like problem-solving and learning.

Short-term memory (I) also declines, but I think processing speed decline is more pronounced because it affects so many other areas. Also, crystallized intelligence (G) doesn't decline, so that's out. So between C and I, which is more significant? I think processing speed is the key factor because slower processing affects a wide array of cognitive functions, leading to declines in other areas as a result.

Wait, but what about the ability to learn new languages (B)? Language learning is more about explicit memory and new information, which might be tied to processing speed. If processing slows, learning new things becomes harder.

So, putting it all together, the function that tends to decline the most with age is probably the ability to process information rapidly. So the answer should be C.

The function that tends to decline the most with age is the ability to process information rapidly. This decline affects many other cognitive tasks and is a significant factor in aging. 

Answer: C
