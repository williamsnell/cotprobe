Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about the money rate of interest when the inflation rate is 6%. The goal is to find what rate would make people hold the same proportion of their assets in money as they would when prices are stable. The real rate of interest is given as 5%, and it's not affected by inflation.

Hmm, I remember there's something about the Fisher equation here. Fisher's equation relates the nominal interest rate to the real interest rate and inflation. The formula is something like (1 + nominal rate) = (1 + real rate) * (1 + inflation rate). Or wait, is it the other way around? Oh right, the nominal rate is approximately equal to the real rate plus the inflation rate.

Wait, no, wait. The Fisher equation is: nominal interest rate = real interest rate + expected inflation rate. So if the real rate is r and inflation is π, then the nominal i is approximately r + π. But wait, there's a more precise formula. Oh right, the exact formula is (1 + i) = (1 + r) * (1 + π). But for small values, the approximation holds.

But wait, let's think again. The question is about the proportion of assets held in money. When prices are stable, the demand for money should be a certain amount. When there's inflation, the nominal money needed increases, but people adjust their holdings.

Wait, but the question is about inducing people to hold the same proportion as they would with stable prices. So, the real money supply must remain the same. Because if prices rise, the real value of money decreases unless the nominal amount increases proportionally. So, the idea is that the real quantity of money (M/P) remains constant, meaning that the nominal quantity M must increase with the price level P.

But how does this relate to interest rates? Oh, right, the demand for money is also influenced by the opportunity cost, which is the interest rate. The higher the interest rate, the more expensive it is to hold money (since you could earn interest instead), so people hold less money.

So, when inflation is present, the nominal interest rate has to adjust to keep the real quantity of money the same. Oh wait, because if inflation is higher, the real value of money holdings decreases unless nominal balances increase. But in terms of interest rates, the nominal rate must compensate for inflation so that the real rate remains the same.

Wait, the real rate is given as 5%, and it's not affected by inflation. So the real rate r is 5%. The nominal rate i must satisfy the Fisher equation: i ≈ r + π.

So, plugging in numbers: i = 5% + 6% = 11%. So the nominal rate needs to be 11% when inflation is 6% to keep the real rate at 5%.

Looking at the options, option G is 11%. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check. Because the question says that the real rate isn't affected by inflation. So when inflation is 6%, the real rate is still 5%. So the nominal rate would be 5% + 6% = 11%, which is option G.

Yes, that makes sense. I think that's correct.

To determine the money rate of interest at an inflation rate of 6% that would induce people to hold the same proportion of their assets in the form of money as they would with stable prices, we use the Fisher equation. The Fisher equation states:

\[
(1 + i) = (1 + r) \cdot (1 + \pi)
\]

Where:
- \(i\) is the nominal interest rate,
- \(r\) is the real interest rate (5% in this case),
- \(\pi\) is the inflation rate (6%).

Since the real rate of interest is not affected by inflation, we can simplify the equation for small values:

\[
i \approx r + \pi
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
i = 5\% + 6\% = 11\%
\]

Thus, the nominal interest rate must be 11% to maintain the same proportion of assets in money. Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

G: 11%

Answer: G
