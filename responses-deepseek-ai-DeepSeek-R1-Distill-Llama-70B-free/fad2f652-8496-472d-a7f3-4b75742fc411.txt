Okay, so I have this question about a resistor and voltage. Hmm, let me think. The question says a 10-Ω resistor carries 10 A. I'm supposed to find the voltage across it.

Wait, I remember Ohm's Law. Ohm's Law is V = I * R, right? So voltage equals current multiplied by resistance. Let me plug in the numbers here. The resistance R is 10 ohms, and the current I is 10 amps. So V should be 10 * 10, which is 100 volts. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 100 V as one of them. Did I do something wrong?

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Oh, wait, the options given don't have 100 V. Let me check the options again. The options are A through J. Option A is exactly 20 V. Hmm, 20 is 10 times 2, but wait, I thought it's 10 times 10. Did I mix up the values? Oh wait, no—the question says 10 Ω resistor and 10 A. So 10 * 10 is 100. But the options don't have that. Oh wait, maybe I read the question wrong.

Wait, let me read the question again. Oh, maybe the resistor is not the only component? Or perhaps it's part of a different circuit? No, the question only mentions the resistor. So I think I should stick to Ohm's Law here.

Looking back at the options, option G is greater than 20 V. Well, 100 V is greater than 20, so that would fit. So if the calculation is correct, the voltage is 100 V, which is way more than 20. So the correct answer would be option G: Greater than 20 V.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Ohm's Law applies here only if the resistor is not in a situation where other factors like inductance or capacitance are involved. But the question doesn't mention anything like that, so it's a straightforward DC case. So yeah, V = I * R = 10 * 10 = 100 V. So the voltage is definitely greater than 20 V. So the answer should be G.

To determine the voltage across the resistor, we use Ohm's Law: 

\[
V = I \cdot R
\]

Here, the resistance \( R \) is \( 10 \, \Omega \), and the current \( I \) is \( 10 \, \text{A} \). Substituting these values:

\[
V = 10 \cdot 10 = 100 \, \text{V}
\]

The calculated voltage is \( 100 \, \text{V} \), which is greater than \( 20 \, \text{V} \). Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**G: Greater than 20 V**

Answer: G
