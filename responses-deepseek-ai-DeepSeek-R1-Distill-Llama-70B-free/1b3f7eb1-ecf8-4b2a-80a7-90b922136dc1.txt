The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A town had been experiencing a rash of bank robberies. All the witnesses at each bank had described a man with a gun who said, "Get down on the floor and no one has to die today!" Following a series of leads, the detectives in the case finally made an arrest. At the police station, the suspect was placed in a lineup. One of the victims observed the lineup, and after each of the six participants stated, "Get down on the floor and no one has to die today," the victim identified the suspect as the perpetrator. The defendant's attorney subsequently moved to suppress the out-of-court identification, arguing that because the defendant was forced to speak, this violated his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, which had been invoked previously by the defendant. The police requirement that the defendant state at the lineup, "Get down on the floor and no one has to die today"

Options:

A: was a permissible police procedure as the statement was not incriminating.
B: violated the defendant's right to a fair trial.
C: was an infringement on the defendant's right to counsel.
D: was not a violation because the defendant had already invoked his right to remain silent.
E: would not prohibit the defendant's lineup identification from being introduced at trial.
F: would make the defendant's lineup identification admissible only if corroborated by other evidence.
G: invalidated the lineup.
H: tainted the victim's identification of the defendant.
I: was an acceptable method of identification because the defendant was not under oath.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about criminal procedure, specifically dealing with the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

Let me read the question again. So, there's a town with a bunch of bank robberies. Witnesses describe a man with a gun saying, "Get down on the floor and no one has to die today!" Detectives arrest a suspect and put him in a lineup. The victim is brought in, and each of the six people in the lineup says that same phrase. The victim then identifies the suspect as the perpetrator. 

The defense attorney is moving to suppress the out-of-court identification because the defendant was forced to speak, violating his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, which he had previously invoked.

The question is about whether the police's requirement for the defendant to state that phrase during the lineup is a violation.

The options are A through J, each giving a different legal take.

Alright, so I remember that the Fifth Amendment protects against self-incrimination. But in the context of a lineup, what's the rule here? I think the key cases are Schmerber v. California and United States v. Wade, maybe others.

Wait, Schmerber was about blood tests, right? The court said that the Fifth Amendment doesn't protect against the production of physical evidence, like blood, because it's not testimonial. So, it's about whether the evidence is testimonial or not.

In the case of a lineup, when the suspect is asked to speak, is that considered testimonial? Because they're using their own voice to make statements. So, unlike just standing in a lineup or providing a fingerprint, speaking involves the content of their voice, which could incriminate them.

In the case of United States v. Wade, the Supreme Court held that a lineup is a critical stage of prosecution, so the defendant has the right to counsel. But that's more about the setup of the lineup, not about speaking.

Wait, but then there's Doyle v. Ohio, which says that post-Miranda silence can't be used against the defendant. But that's a different issue.

Another case I'm trying to recall is when the suspect is forced to give a voice exemplar. So, the court has held that the Fifth Amendment doesn't prevent the government from obtaining a voice exemplar because it's not testimonial. Wait, no, is that right? Or is it that it's considered non-testimonial, so it's allowed.

Wait, in the case of United States v. Dionisio, 410 U.S. 1 (1973), the court held that compelling a person to give a voice sample is not a violation of the Fifth Amendment because it doesn't compel testimonial communication. Similarly, in United States v. Mara, the court said that providing a handwriting sample isn't testimonial.

So, in that line of thinking, making a defendant speak in a lineup, especially a phrase that could link them to the crime, would that be considered testimonial? Because the content of the statement could incriminate them.

Wait, but in the problem, the defendant was forced to say the exact words used in the robbery. So, if the defendant says that, and it's the same as what the robber said, it could incriminate him because it connects him to the crime.

So, if the police make him say those words, is that compelled self-incrimination? Or is it just a physical act, like a voice sample, which isn't protected.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's think again. The Fifth Amendment protects a person from being compelled to be a witness against themselves. So, if the government compels someone to make a statement that could incriminate them, that's a problem.

In the case of a lineup, the defendant is part of it. If they make him say something that only the perpetrator would know, that's more like a statement that could incriminate. For example, in some cases, courts have held that forcing a defendant to provide a voice exemplar of a specific phrase used in a crime could be problematic if it's the functional equivalent of testimony.

But wait, in Brooks v. Florida, 469 U.S. 445 (1985), the court held that a defendant could be required to utter certain words in a lineup because it served a legitimate police purpose and didn't violate the Fifth Amendment. So, the idea is that it's not testimonial because it's used for identification purposes, not for obtaining evidence of guilt.

Alternatively, in some cases, courts have found that making a defendant repeat specific words that are incriminating could violate the Fifth Amendment. So, it's a bit of a line. 

In this problem, the defendant was required to say, "Get down on the floor and no one has to die today!" which are the exact words used in the robbery. So, if the suspect says that, it could be seen as an admission. But the police are doing it for identification purposes, not to get a confession.

The Supreme Court in Schmerber distinguished between physical evidence and testimonial evidence. So, physical acts, like giving blood, aren't protected. Testimony that's used to prove guilt is protected.

So, in this case, making the defendant speak those words is more like a physical act, not testimony. Because it's about the voice, the way he sounds, not the content. Wait, but the content is the same as the crime. So, does that matter?

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think about the options. The defense is arguing that making the defendant speak violated his Fifth Amendment rights because he had invoked them.

Option A says it's permissible because the statement wasn't incriminating. But the statement itself is the same as the robber's, so it could incriminate. So I don't think A is correct.

Option E says it wouldn't prohibit the identification from being used. So, the lineup ID would still be admissible. But if the lineup was tainted by the compelled statement, maybe the ID is suppressed.

Option G says it invalidated the lineup. If the procedure was improper, the lineup could be considered suggestive, leading to suppression.

Wait, but the issue here is the Fifth Amendment, not the suggestiveness of the lineup. So, if the lineup was conducted in a way that violated the defendant's rights, the identification might be tainted.

But I'm trying to remember if courts have held that making a defendant speak in a lineup violates the Fifth Amendment. I think in some cases, it's allowed because it's not considered testimonial.

Wait, in the case of United States v. Wade, the court said lineups are subject to scrutiny under the Fifth Amendment, but more about due process and counsel's presence. But when it comes to compelled statements, I think the key case is whether it's testimonial.

In Doyle v. Ohio, the issue was using post-Miranda silence against the defendant, which the court said was a Fifth Amendment violation. But that's different.

Wait, another angle: when a defendant is compelled to make a statement, like in a lineup, is it considered compelled testimony? I think that the courts have held that requiring a defendant to utter certain words for identification purposes doesn't violate the Fifth Amendment because it's not testimonial in nature. It's more of a physical act, akin to providing a fingerprint or a voice exemplar.

So, in that case, the police's requirement would not be a Fifth Amendment violation, meaning the lineup identification wouldn't be suppressed on those grounds.

Looking at the options, option A says it's permissible because the statement wasn't incriminating. But the statement was exactly what the robber said, so it could be incriminating. So maybe A isn't correct.

Option E says it wouldn't prohibit the lineup ID from being introduced. So, even if there's a Fifth Amendment issue, maybe the identification is still admissible. Wait, but if the lineup procedure was unconstitutional, the identification might be suppressed as tainted.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the Fifth Amendment was invoked, so the defendant couldn't be compelled to speak. But once Miranda rights are invoked, the police can't interrogate. But a lineup isn't interrogation, right? Because it's not questioning; it's more about identification.

Wait, but in this case, the defendant was forced to speak. So, is that a form of interrogation? Probably not in the traditional sense, since it's about identification, not asking questions that would lead to incriminating statements.

So, putting it all together, I think the police's action of requiring the defendant to speak in the lineup did not violate the Fifth Amendment because it's not considered testimonial. Therefore, the lineup identification would still be admissible, so the attorney's motion to suppress would fail. So, the correct answer would be E: would not prohibit the defendant's lineup identification from being introduced at trial.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure. Another angle: the Fifth Amendment protects against compelled self-incrimination. If the defendant is forced to speak the exact words used in the robbery, that could be self-incriminating because it proves he can speak those words, which the robber did. But is that really incriminating? Or is it just a physical act?

I think courts have held that voice exemplars are permissible. So, in this case, making the defendant say the phrase is similar. Therefore, it's permissible, so the identification stands.

The question revolves around whether requiring the defendant to speak specific words during a lineup violates the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The defendant was forced to repeat the phrase, "Get down on the floor and no one has to die today!"—the same words used during the robbery. The defense argues that this violated the defendant's Fifth Amendment rights, which had been invoked.

Key considerations include whether the compelled speech constitutes testimonial evidence or a physical act. The Fifth Amendment protects against compelled testimonial evidence but not physical acts like fingerprints or voice exemplars. Courts have held that requiring a defendant to utter specific words for identification purposes, such as in a lineup, does not violate the Fifth Amendment because it is not considered testimonial. Instead, it is treated as a physical act akin to providing a voice exemplar, which serves a legitimate police purpose.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The statement could be incriminating because it links the defendant to the crime.
- **Option E**: Correct. The lineup identification would not be prohibited from being introduced at trial because the compelled speech is not considered testimonial and does not violate the Fifth Amendment.
- Other options (B, C, D, F, G, H, I) are incorrect because they mischaracterize the legal implications or fail to align with established precedent.

Thus, the police's requirement for the defendant to speak during the lineup was permissible, and the identification would not be suppressed on Fifth Amendment grounds.
