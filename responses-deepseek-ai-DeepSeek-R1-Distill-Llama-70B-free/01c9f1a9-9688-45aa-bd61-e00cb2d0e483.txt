Okay, so I have this problem where a homebuyer wants to finance a $95,000 mortgage over 20 years, and they don't want their monthly payments to exceed $900. I need to find the maximum interest rate they can afford. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on mortgage calculations, but I think I can figure this out.

First, I remember that mortgage payments are calculated using the amortization formula. The formula for the monthly payment (M) is M = P[r(1+r)^n]/[(1+r)^n -1], where P is the principal, r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of payments.

Let me plug in the numbers I have. The principal P is $95,000, the monthly payment M is $900, and the term is 20 years, which means n is 20*12 = 240 months.

So the equation becomes:
900 = 95,000 [ r(1 + r)^240 ] / [ (1 + r)^240 - 1 ]

Hmm, solving for r here might be tricky because it's in an exponent and also multiplied out front. I don't think there's a straightforward algebraic way to solve for r here. I remember that usually, people use financial calculators or iterative methods to solve for the interest rate in such cases.

Alternatively, I could try plugging in the options given and see which one gets closest to the $900 payment without exceeding it. Let me list out the options again:

A: 10.00%
B:12.80%
C:7.50%
D:11.99%
E:8.27%
F:5.45%
G:9.73%
H:8.95%
I:6.35%
J:10.85%

Wait, but these are annual interest rates, right? So I need to convert them to monthly rates by dividing by 12.

Let me try one by one.

Starting with option A: 10% annual. Monthly rate is 10/12 ≈ 0.008333.

Plugging into the formula:

Calculate numerator: 0.008333 * (1 + 0.008333)^240

Wait, (1.008333)^240. I think that's going to be a large number. Let me approximate it. Since 240 months is 20 years, at 10% annually, the future value factor is (1.1)^20. Wait, but that's for annual compounding. Oh wait, but since we're calculating monthly, it's (1 + 0.1/12)^240.

Alternatively, I can use the formula in a calculator, but since I don't have one here, maybe I can approximate or think about what the payment would be.

Wait, let's think about the general idea. At higher interest rates, the monthly payment increases, so the maximum rate is the one where M equals 900. So I need to find the rate where the payment is exactly 900.

I think the correct approach is to use trial and error with the given options.

Let me try option G: 9.73% annual rate. So monthly r = 9.73/1200 ≈ 0.008108.

Compute the denominator: (1 + 0.008108)^240 - 1.

Wait, calculating (1.008108)^240. Hmm, I don't know this off the top of my head, but perhaps I can estimate.

Wait, perhaps I can use the rule of 72 or other quick approximations, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I can think about the present value of an annuity formula.

Alternatively, maybe I can remember that for a 20-year mortgage, the factor for PVIFA (present value interest factor of annuity) is PVIFA = [1 - (1 + r)^-n] / r.

But wait, in the payment formula, M = P * [r / (1 - (1 + r)^-n)].

So for each option, I can compute M and see if it's close to 900.

Let me try option E: 8.27% annual. Monthly r = 8.27/1200 ≈ 0.006908.

n=240.

Compute denominator: 1 - (1 + 0.006908)^-240.

Wait, (1.006908)^-240 is 1/(1.006908)^240. Let me think, at 8.27% annual, over 20 years, the factor (1 + 0.0827/12)^240.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate (1.006908)^240. Let me approximate this. Let me compute ln(1.006908) = approx 0.006888. Multiply by 240 gives about 1.653. So e^1.653 ≈ 5.24. So (1.006908)^240 ≈ 5.24, so 1/5.24≈0.1909.

So denominator is 1 - 0.1909 = 0.8091.

So [r / denominator] is 0.006908 / 0.8091 ≈ 0.00853.

So M = 95,000 * 0.00853 ≈ 95,000 * 0.00853.

Wait, 95,000 * 0.008 is 760, 0.00053 is about 50. So total approx 760 + 50.35 = 810.35. But that's way below 900. So option E's payment is around $810, which is under $900. So the interest rate can be higher.

Wait, but that might not be accurate because my estimation of (1.006908)^240 as 5.24 might be off. Alternatively, maybe I should try a higher rate.

Let me try option H: 8.95% annual. Monthly r = 8.95/1200 ≈ 0.007458.

Compute denominator: 1 - (1.007458)^-240.

Again, compute (1.007458)^240.

Take natural log: ln(1.007458) ≈ 0.007414. Multiply by 240: 0.007414 * 240 ≈ 1.779.

e^1.779 ≈ 5.914. So (1.007458)^240 ≈ 5.914, so 1/5.914 ≈ 0.1692.

Denominator: 1 - 0.1692 = 0.8308.

So [r / denominator] = 0.007458 / 0.8308 ≈ 0.00897.

M = 95000 * 0.00897 ≈ 95000 * 0.009 = 855, but 0.00897 is slightly less, so maybe 853. So that's still below 900.

Hmm, so option H gives around 853, which is still under 900. So we need a higher rate.

Next, option G: 9.73% annual. Monthly r = 9.73/1200 ≈ 0.008108.

Compute denominator: 1 - (1.008108)^-240.

Let me compute (1.008108)^240.

ln(1.008108) ≈ 0.008078. Multiply by 240: 1.93872.

e^1.93872 is approximately e^1.9 is around 6.7, since e^1.6 is 4.95, e^1.8≈6.05, e^1.9≈6.7, e^2=7.389. So 1.93872 is close to e^1.93, which is about 6.89.

So (1.008108)^240 ≈ 6.89, so 1/6.89 ≈ 0.145.

Denominator: 1 - 0.145 = 0.855.

So [r / denominator] = 0.008108 / 0.855 ≈ 0.00948.

M = 95000 * 0.00948 ≈ 95000 * 0.0095 ≈ 902.5. Oh, that's very close to 900. So maybe that's the right rate. But let's check the exact calculation because my estimations might be a bit off.

Wait, but according to this, option G gives a payment of approximately $902.50, which is just over $900. So perhaps the correct answer is just below that rate.

Wait, but the question asks for the maximum rate that doesn't exceed $900. So if option G gives a payment slightly over, maybe the correct option is a rate just below G.

Wait, let me see the options:

G is 9.73%, and H is 8.95%, which we saw gives 853. So between H and G, perhaps the correct rate is around 9.73% because that's when the payment hits 900.

Wait, but I thought G gives 902.5, which is just over. So maybe the correct rate is a little lower than G, but perhaps among the options, G is the closest without going over.

Wait, perhaps I should try another option. Let's try option D: 11.99% annual. Monthly r = 11.99/1200 ≈ 0.009991.

Compute denominator: 1 - (1.009991)^-240.

Compute (1.009991)^240. Taking ln(1.009991) ≈ 0.00996. Multiply by 240: 2.3904. e^2.3904 ≈ 10.92. So 1/10.92 ≈ 0.0916.

Denominator: 1 - 0.0916 = 0.9084.

So [r / denominator] = 0.009991 / 0.9084 ≈ 0.01099.

M = 95000 * 0.01099 ≈ 95000 * 0.011 ≈ 1045. That's way over 900, so option D is too high.

What about option A: 10% annual. Monthly r = 0.008333.

Compute (1.008333)^240. Let's compute ln(1.008333) ≈ 0.0083. Multiply by 240: 2. So e^2 ≈ 7.389. So (1.008333)^240 ≈ 7.389, so 1/7.389≈0.1353.

Denominator: 1 - 0.1353 = 0.8647.

So [r/denominator] = 0.008333/0.8647 ≈0.00963.

M = 95000 * 0.00963 ≈ 915. That's over 900. So option A gives $915, which is above the limit. So the rate must be lower than 10%.

Wait, but earlier with option G, I calculated around 902, which is just over 900. So perhaps the correct answer is G, but let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I should try option C: 7.5%. Monthly r = 0.0075.

Compute (1.0075)^240. Let's compute ln(1.0075)=approx 0.007472. Multiply by 240: 1.793. e^1.793≈ about 6.03.

So 1/6.03≈0.1659.

Denominator: 1 - 0.1659=0.8341.

[r/denominator]=0.0075/0.8341≈0.008997.

M=95000 *0.008997≈ 855. So that's under 900.

Hmm, so between option C (7.5%) and G (9.73%), the payment goes from 855 to 902. So the maximum rate would be just where the payment is 900. So perhaps the correct option is G, because at G, the payment is 902, which is just over, but maybe in the actual calculation, it's closer.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my approximations. Maybe I should try to compute more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula correctly.

The formula is M = P * [r(1+r)^n]/[(1+r)^n -1]

Let me try option G: 9.73% annual.

r = 9.73 / 1200 ≈ 0.008108333.

n=240.

Compute (1 + r)^n = (1.008108333)^240.

I can compute this more accurately. Let me use logarithms.

ln(1.008108333)= approximately 0.008078.

Multiply by 240: 0.008078 *240 ≈ 1.93872.

e^1.93872 ≈ 6.89 as before.

So (1.008108)^240 ≈ 6.89.

So numerator: r*(1+r)^n = 0.008108333 * 6.89 ≈ 0.0558.

Denominator: (1+r)^n -1 = 6.89 -1 = 5.89.

So M = 95000 * (0.0558 / 5.89) = 95000 * 0.00947 ≈ 95000 * 0.00947 = let's compute.

95000 * 0.009 = 855.

95000 * 0.00047 = approx 44.65.

So total is 855 +44.65≈ 899.65, which is about $899.65, which is just under $900.

Wait, that's a much better approximation. So M≈899.65, which is under $900. So option G would be acceptable.

Wait, so earlier I thought it was 902, but perhaps a more accurate calculation gives around 899.65, which is under 900. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (1.008108)^240 more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the rule that (1 + r)^n = e^(n*ln(1+r)).

Let me compute more accurately:

r = 0.008108333.

ln(1.008108333) = ?

Using a calculator, but since I don't have one, I can approximate.

The Taylor series for ln(1+x) around x=0 is x - x²/2 + x³/3 - x^4/4 +...

x=0.008108333.

So ln(1.008108333) ≈ 0.008108333 - (0.008108333)^2 / 2 + (0.008108333)^3 /3.

Compute:

0.008108333 squared is approximately 0.00006573.

0.00006573 / 2 = 0.00003286.

0.008108333 cubed is approx 0.000000534.

Divide by 3: 0.000000178.

So ln ≈ 0.008108333 - 0.00003286 + 0.000000178 ≈ 0.00807565.

Multiply by 240: 0.00807565 *240 = 1.938156.

e^1.938156 ≈ ?

We know that e^1.936 is around 6.89 because earlier approximation, but let's see.

Wait, e^1.9 is about 6.7, e^1.93 is e^(1.9 +0.03) = e^1.9 * e^0.03 ≈6.7 *1.03045≈6.905.

So e^1.938156 ≈ approximately 6.905.

So (1.008108)^240 ≈6.905.

So numerator: 0.008108333 *6.905 ≈0.0560.

Denominator: 6.905 -1 =5.905.

So M=95000*(0.0560/5.905)=95000*(0.009478) ≈95000*0.009478.

Compute 95000 *0.009478:

95000 *0.009 =855.

95000 *0.000478= approx 45.41.

So total ≈855 +45.41= 900.41.

Ah, so with more accurate calculation, the payment is approximately $900.41, which is just over $900. So option G gives a payment of about $900.41, which is slightly above the limit. Therefore, the maximum allowable rate is just below this, but among the given options, the next lower option would be H, which was 8.95% and gave a payment of around $853, which is way under. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because there's a big gap between 8.95% and 9.73%.

Wait, perhaps I missed an option in between. Let me check the options again:

Options:
E:8.27%, H:8.95%, G:9.73%.

So perhaps the correct rate is between 9.73% and a lower rate, but in the options, G is the highest before the payment exceeds 900.

Wait, but according to the calculation, G gives a payment of $900.41, which is just over. So the maximum rate is just below 9.73%. Since the options don't include a rate just below 9.73%, perhaps the correct answer is G, as it's the closest without going over, but in reality, it's just over.

Wait, but the question asks for the maximum rate such that the payment does not exceed $900. So if G gives $900.41, which is over, then G is too high. So the correct rate must be lower than 9.73%. So perhaps the correct option is not G. Let me check another option between 8.95% and 9.73%. Are there any options in between? Let's see:

Options are up to J, which is 10.85%. So between H (8.95%) and G (9.73%), there's nothing. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use a better method to approximate the exact rate.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is G, and the approximation was a bit off. Or perhaps I should consider that the exact calculation might bring it under $900.

Wait, perhaps using a financial calculator would be more accurate, but since I can't do that, maybe I can try another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can set up the equation and solve for r numerically.

The equation is:

900 = 95000 * [ r (1 + r)^240 ] / [ (1 + r)^240 - 1 ]

Let me denote x = (1 + r)^240.

Then the equation becomes:

900 = 95000 * r x / (x -1)

Simplify:

900 (x -1) = 95000 r x

Divide both sides by 100:

9 (x-1) = 950 r x

But I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, I can write it as:

(x - 1) / (r x) = 95000 / 900 = 950/9 ≈105.555...

So (x -1
