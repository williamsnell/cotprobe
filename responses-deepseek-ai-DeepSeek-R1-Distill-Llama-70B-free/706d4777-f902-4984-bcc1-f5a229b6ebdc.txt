Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the determinant of a 3x3 matrix. The matrix given is A = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]. Hmm, I remember that the determinant is a scalar value computed from the elements of a square matrix and it's useful in various linear algebra applications, like determining if a matrix is invertible.

Wait, right, the determinant for a 3x3 matrix can be calculated using the rule of Sarrus or the general method of expansion by minors. I'm a bit rusty on Sarrus, so maybe I'll go with the expansion method.

The formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix:

det(A) = a(ei − fh) − b(di − fg) + c(dh − eg)

Where the matrix is:
[a b c]
[d e f]
[g h i]

So applying this to the given matrix:

The elements are:
a=1, b=2, c=3
d=4, e=5, f=6
g=7, h=8, i=9

Plugging into the formula:

det(A) = 1*(5*9 - 6*8) - 2*(4*9 - 6*7) + 3*(4*8 - 5*7)

Let me compute each part step by step.

First part: 1*(5*9 - 6*8)
5*9 is 45, 6*8 is 48. So 45-48 = -3. Multiply by 1: -3.

Second part: -2*(4*9 -6*7)
4*9 is 36, 6*7 is 42. 36-42 = -6. Multiply by -2: -2*(-6) = 12.

Third part: 3*(4*8 -5*7)
4*8 is 32, 5*7 is 35. 32-35 = -3. Multiply by 3: 3*(-3) = -9.

Now sum all three parts: (-3) + 12 + (-9) = (-3 -9) +12 = (-12) +12 = 0.

Wait, so the determinant is 0? That means the matrix is singular, and it doesn't have an inverse. Oh right, I remember that if the determinant is zero, the matrix is singular.

Looking at the options, option A is 0. So the correct answer should be A.

The determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{det}(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)
\]

For the given matrix \( A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 4 & 5 & 6 \\ 7 & 8 & 9 \end{bmatrix} \), the elements are \( a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4, e=5, f=6, g=7, h=8, i=9 \). Substituting these into the formula:

1. First term: \( 1 \cdot (5 \cdot 9 - 6 \cdot 8) = 1 \cdot (45 - 48) = -3 \)
2. Second term: \( -2 \cdot (4 \cdot 9 - 6 \cdot 7) = -2 \cdot (36 - 42) = -2 \cdot (-6) = 12 \)
3. Third term: \( 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 8 - 5 \cdot 7) = 3 \cdot (32 - 35) = 3 \cdot (-3) = -9 \)

Adding these terms together:

\[
\text{det}(A) = -3 + 12 - 9 = 0
\]

Thus, the determinant of the matrix is \( 0 \), indicating that the matrix is singular and does not have an inverse. The correct answer is:

A: 0
