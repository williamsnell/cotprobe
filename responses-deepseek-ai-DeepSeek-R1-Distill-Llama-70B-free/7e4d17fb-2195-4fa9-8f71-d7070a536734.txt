Okay, so I have this physics problem here about mirrors and images. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is in two parts, (a) and (b). Let's start with part (a).

So, the situation is: there's a headlight lamp filament that's 10 cm in front of a mirror. The image of this filament needs to be formed on a wall that's 3 meters away from the mirror. I need to determine what type of mirror is required for this setup.

Wait, mirrors can be concave, convex, or plane. Each type forms images differently. I remember that concave mirrors can form real images, which can be projected onto a screen. Convex mirrors and plane mirrors usually form virtual images, which can't be projected on a screen.

In this case, the image needs to be on a wall, which means it must be a real image. So, the mirror should be a concave mirror. Because convex can't form real images in this scenario, and plane mirrors only form virtual images at the same distance as the object, I think.

Wait, wait. Wait, plane mirrors can form images, but they're virtual and located behind the mirror. So if the object is in front, the image is behind. But the wall is on the same side as the object, I suppose. Because the filament is in front of the mirror, and the wall is 3 meters from the mirror on the opposite side. So, the image must be real and on the opposite side of the mirror from the object.

So, the mirror must be concave. So for part (a), the answer is concave mirror.

Now, part (b): the height of the image when the object's height is 5 mm. I need to find the magnification to determine if the image is upright or inverted and its size.

Wait, I think the magnification formula is m = - (di)/ (do), where di is image distance and do is object distance. But wait, I remember for mirrors, the magnification is given by m = height of image / height of object = - (di) / (do).

Wait, in this case, the object is 10 cm in front of the mirror, so do is 0.1 meters. The image is formed at 3 meters from the mirror, so di is 3 m.

So plugging into m = - di/do = -3 /0.1 = -30. So the magnification is -30 times. The negative sign indicates that the image is inverted.

So the height of the image is m multiplied by the object's height. Object height is 5 mm. So 5 mm * 30 = 150 mm. But wait, the sign is negative, which just tells us it's inverted, not the size. So the image height is 150 mm.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. Object distance is 10 cm, which is 0.1 m. Image distance is 3 m. So m = - (3)/(0.1) = -30. So the image is 30 times larger than the object. Since the object is 5 mm, the image is 5 *30 =150 mm.

So the height is 150 mm, and it's inverted, but the question only asks for the height, not orientation.

So putting it together: part (a) requires a concave mirror, part (b) the image is 150 mm high.

Looking at the options, let's see. The options are A to J.

Option C is Concave mirror, 150 mm. So that's the correct choice for both (a) and (b). Let me make sure there are no other options that match. Let's scan the options.

Option C: Concave mirror, 150 mm. Yep. So the answer should be C.

To determine the type of mirror required and the height of the image:

(a) The problem specifies that the image must be formed on a wall 3 meters from the mirror. Since the image is projected onto a wall, it must be a **real image**. Concave mirrors can form real images when the object is placed within the focal length, making them suitable for this setup. Convex mirrors and plane mirrors cannot form real images, so they are not appropriate. Thus, a **concave mirror** is required.

(b) The height of the image can be calculated using the magnification formula for mirrors:  
\[
m = -\frac{d_i}{d_o}
\]  
where \(d_i = 3 \, \text{m}\) (image distance) and \(d_o = 0.1 \, \text{m}\) (object distance). Substituting these values:  
\[
m = -\frac{3}{0.1} = -30
\]  
The negative sign indicates the image is inverted, but the magnification factor is 30. The height of the object is \(5 \, \text{mm}\), so the height of the image is:  
\[
\text{Height of image} = m \times \text{Height of object} = 30 \times 5 \, \text{mm} = 150 \, \text{mm}
\]

From the given options, the correct choice is **C: Concave mirror, 150 mm**.
