Question:

A pharmacist was employed by a drug store. A long-time customer of the drug store presented a prescription to the pharmacist for the medication Clinoril, which was prescribed by her physician to treat her arthritic condition. The pharmacist was in a rush that day because of a backlog of prescriptions to fill, and he misread the customer's prescription. He filled her prescription with Clinitest, a caustic substance not for internal use. He labeled the container with the instructions for Clinoril: "Take one tablet twice a day. "The customer followed the instructions, consumed the Clinitest, and suffered severe injuries to her stomach and esophagus. If the customer brings a strict liability in tort action against the pharmacist, what is his best defense?

Options:

A: It was the cashier and not he who personally received the money for the medication.
B: He was not a seller of the product upon whom strict liability may be imposed.
C: He exercised reasonable care under the circumstances.
D: The drug store was not the manufacturer upon whom ultimate liability falls.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about tort law, specifically strict liability. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a pharmacist who made a mistake filling a prescription. The customer gave a prescription for Clinoril, which is a medication for arthritis. But the pharmacist was in a rush and misread it, giving her Clinitest instead. Clinitest is a caustic substance not meant to be taken internally. He labeled it with the wrong instructions, telling her to take it twice a day. She followed them and got really hurt.

Now, the customer is suing the pharmacist under strict liability in tort. The question is asking what the pharmacist's best defense would be.

First, I need to remember what strict liability means. Strict liability, or sometimes called products liability, doesn't require proof of negligence. It's about the defendant being responsible for certain actions or products that are inherently dangerous. It often applies to manufacturers or sellers of products.

In this case, the pharmacist filled the wrong medication. So, did he sell a defective product? Or was he just negligent?

I think the key here is whether the pharmacist is considered a "seller" under strict liability law. Typically, strict liability applies to commercial sellers in the chain of distribution. Pharmacists are usually seen as sellers because they sell prescription drugs. So, if the pharmacist is a seller, he could be strictly liable for selling a defective product.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it was the cashier who took the money, not him. But strict liability isn't about who took the money; it's about who sold the product. The pharmacist filled the prescription, so he's the seller. So A doesn't seem right.

Option B says he wasn't a seller. Wait, but I just thought pharmacists are sellers. So maybe B is incorrect. Unless there's a reason why he isn't considered a seller here. Hmm.

Option C says he exercised reasonable care. But strict liability doesn't require negligence. Even if he was careful, if the product was defective and caused harm, he could still be liable. So C probably isn't a good defense.

Option D says the drug store wasn't the manufacturer. That's true, but under strict liability, each seller in the chain can be liable. The manufacturer, distributor, and retailer can all be sued. So just because the drug store isn't the manufacturer doesn't mean they're not liable. So D might not be a good defense either.

Wait, but let me think again about Option B. The question is whether the pharmacist is a seller. Pharmacists are generally considered part of the distribution chain. They sell the drugs to the consumer. So if that's the case, B's argument that he's not a seller wouldn't hold. So B would not be a valid defense.

Wait, but maybe there's a nuance here. Strict liability typically applies to the commercial sale of goods. Pharmacists are selling goods (the medication) as part of their business. So the pharmacist would be a seller, making B incorrect as a defense.

So the only possible defenses left are whether strict liability applies to him. If he's a seller, then he can be strictly liable. But if for some reason he isn't considered a seller, like if he's just an employee and not the actual seller, but generally, the employer (the drug store) would be the seller. But the question is about the pharmacist being sued individually.

Wait, the question says the pharmacist was employed by the drug store. So perhaps the pharmacist isn't the seller; the store is. So maybe the pharmacist isn't a commercial seller, but an employee. In that case, strict liability might not apply to him as an individual because he's not the seller. The store would be the seller. So maybe B is the correct answer.

But wait, another angle: some jurisdictions might impose strict liability on pharmacists when they fill prescriptions. Because they have a duty to ensure the correct medication is dispensed. But I'm not sure about that. I think generally, pharmacists can be held strictly liable for dispensing the wrong drug because it's a breach of their duty of care, but that's more about negligence.

Wait, no, strict liability doesn't require negligence. It's about the product being defective. In this case, the product was Clinitest, which is a caustic substance not meant to be ingested. So it's a defective product because it's not suitable for its intended use as prescribed. The pharmacist provided the wrong product, which is a defect.

So under strict liability, the pharmacist, as the seller, would be liable. So the best defense would be if he's not a seller. So option B could be correct if he's not considered a seller.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The pharmacist is selling the medication, so he's part of the distribution chain. Thus, he is a seller. So he can't use B as a defense because it's not true. So the best defense would be something else.

Wait, but maybe the fact that he's a pharmacist and not a commercial seller? No, pharmacists are commercial sellers. So that doesn't help.

Looking back at the options, option C is about exercising reasonable care. But strict liability doesn't care about due care. So even if he was careful, if the product was defective, he's liable. So C isn't a defense.

Option D says the drug store isn't the manufacturer. But as a seller, the store can still be liable. So D isn't a defense.

So if all other options are incorrect, the only one left is B, but I thought B would be incorrect because he is a seller. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding option B.

Option B says "He was not a seller of the product upon whom strict liability may be imposed." So if he's not a seller, then strict liability doesn't apply. But is he a seller?

In some cases, employees aren't considered sellers. The employer is. So if the pharmacist is an employee, then the employer (drug store) is the seller. So the pharmacist himself isn't a seller, and strict liability wouldn't apply to him. So option B would be his best defense.

Ah, that makes sense. Because strict liability is typically against the business entity selling the product, not the individual employee, unless the employee was somehow independently a seller. So the pharmacist, being an employee, isn't the seller. Therefore, option B would be correct.

In this case, the pharmacist misfilled a prescription, leading to the customer's injuries. The customer is suing under strict liability in tort, which typically applies to commercial sellers of defective products. The key issue is whether the pharmacist qualifies as a "seller" for the purposes of strict liability.

Strict liability generally applies to those in the chain of distribution, such as manufacturers, distributors, and retailers. Pharmacists, as professionals who dispense medication, are often considered part of this chain and can be held strictly liable for dispensing defective products. However, the pharmacist in this scenario is an employee of the drug store, and strict liability typically applies to the business entity (the employer) rather than the individual employee unless the employee is independently a seller.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: The fact that the cashier, not the pharmacist, received the money is irrelevant. Strict liability focuses on who sold the product, not who handled the payment. This is not a valid defense.
- **Option B**: If the pharmacist is not considered a seller because he is an employee, strict liability may not apply to him individually. This could be a valid defense if the court determines that the pharmacist, as an employee, is not the seller.
- **Option C**: Strict liability does not require proof of negligence. Even if the pharmacist exercised reasonable care, strict liability could still apply if the product was defective. This is not a valid defense.
- **Option D**: The drug store, as a seller, could still be liable under strict liability even if it is not the manufacturer. This is not a valid defense.

The best defense is **Option B**, as it highlights the possibility that the pharmacist, as an employee, is not the seller upon whom strict liability may be imposed. The liability would likely fall on the drug store as the employer and seller of the product.

Answer: B
