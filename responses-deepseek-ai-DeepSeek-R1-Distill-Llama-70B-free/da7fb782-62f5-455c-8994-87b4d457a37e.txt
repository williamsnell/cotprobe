Question:

A 70-year-old woman comes to the office because of worsening tremor of her hands. The tremor has been present for most of her life and initially was mild and would occur only when she was tired or stressed. During the past month the shaking has become more noticeable and frequent. She is now embarrassed to eat with other people because of how obvious the tremor has become. The patient has been taking fluoxetine for the past 3 weeks to help her to cope with the death of her husband 2 months ago. Medical history is also remarkable for essential hypertension controlled with lisinopril and hyperlipidemia controlled with atorvastatin. Her only other medication is occasional ibuprofen for joint pain. She used to drink one to two alcoholic beverages monthly but now drinks one glass of wine daily because, she says, it reduces her tremor. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (155 lb); BMI is 25 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 36.4°C (97.6°F), pulse 80/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 130/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a moderate tremor of both hands that is not present at rest. Complete blood count, serum chemistry profile, and serum thyroid function tests are ordered and results are pending. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's worsening tremor?

Options:

A: Early Parkinson disease
B: Adverse effect of fluoxetine therapy
C: Adverse effect of atorvastatin therapy
D: Adverse effect of ibuprofen therapy
E: Increase in alcohol consumption
F: Hyperthyroidism
G: Bereavement reaction
H: Adverse effect of lisinopril therapy
I: Essential tremor exacerbated by stress
J: Onset of multiple sclerosis

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this medical question. Let me read it carefully.

So the patient is a 70-year-old woman with a worsening tremor in her hands. The tremor has been present most of her life, but it's gotten worse over the past month. Initially, it was mild and only happened when she was tired or stressed. Now it's more noticeable and frequent, which makes her embarrassed to eat with others.

She's been taking fluoxetine for three weeks because she's coping with her husband's death two months ago. Her medical history includes essential hypertension controlled with lisinopril and hyperlipidemia with atorvastatin. She occasionally takes ibuprofen for joint pain. She used to drink one to two alcoholic beverages a month but now has one glass of wine daily because it helps reduce her tremor.

Her physical exam shows a moderate tremor in both hands, not present at rest. They've ordered some blood tests, but results are pending.

The question is asking for the most likely cause of her worsening tremor.

Hmm. So first, considering her history, she's had a tremor for most of her life. That makes me think it's probably essential tremor, which is a common condition that often starts in early adulthood. Essential tremor is usually an action tremor, meaning it's present when the person is doing something, like eating, and not at rest. That fits with her symptoms—the tremor isn't present at rest.

Now, why has it worsened recently? Let's look at potential factors. She's started fluoxetine three weeks ago. Fluoxetine is an SSRI, and I remember that SSRIs can sometimes cause tremors as a side effect. So that's a possibility.

She's also increased her alcohol consumption. She now drinks a glass of wine daily. I know that alcohol can have a short-term effect of reducing essential tremor, which is why some people might use it. But chronic use can lead to dependence, and maybe the effect wears off, or perhaps it's contributing in another way. But in this case, she's only been drinking more for a month, so maybe the initial benefit is still there, but the tremor is worse. Or perhaps it's not the alcohol but another factor.

Her medications include lisinopril, which is an ACE inhibitor. I don't recall ACE inhibitors commonly causing tremors. Atorvastatin is a statin, and I don't think statins are known for causing tremors either. Ibuprofen is an NSAID, and I don't think that's linked to tremors. So maybe the fluoxetine is the culprit here.

She's also grieving, which can cause stress. Stress and anxiety can exacerbate essential tremor. So her bereavement might be making it worse. But the question is about the worsening over the past month, which coincides with starting fluoxetine.

Let me think about the timeline. She started fluoxetine three weeks ago, and the tremor worsened over the past month. Well, three weeks is a part of that month, so it's possible that the fluoxetine started the problem. But sometimes, it can take a few weeks for side effects to become noticeable.

Other possibilities: Could it be hyperthyroidism? That can cause tremors, but the blood tests would show that. Since the results are pending, but she's had this tremor her whole life, which makes me think it's more likely related to her existing condition rather than a new onset like hyperthyroidism.

Parkinson's disease usually presents with a resting tremor, which she doesn't have. So probably not early Parkinson's.

Multiple sclerosis can cause tremors, but it's usually accompanied by other neurological symptoms, and at her age, it's less likely. So probably not that.

Bereavement reaction is more about mood, but stress from grieving could worsen her existing essential tremor. But the question is about the cause of the worsening, which is more likely a medical factor.

So putting it all together. She has a history of essential tremor, which is an action tremor. The recent worsening could be due to the addition of fluoxetine, which can cause or exacerbate tremors as a side effect. Alternatively, it could be stress from bereavement, but the more likely medical cause is the medication.

Wait, but the options include both: option B is adverse effect of fluoxetine, and option I is essential tremor exacerbated by stress. So which is more likely?

She's been on fluoxetine for three weeks, and the tremor has been worsening for a month. So the timing lines up. Fluoxetine can cause tremors, especially in the initial period. So it's possible that the fluoxetine is making her existing essential tremor worse.

Alternatively, the stress from her husband's death could be making her tremor worse. But the question is about the 'most likely' cause.

I think in this scenario, the addition of a medication known to cause tremors is a strong contender. So the most likely cause is the adverse effect of fluoxetine.

But wait, another thought. Essential tremor can also be exacerbated by certain medications, including SSRIs. So yes, if she has essential tremor, starting an SSRI like fluoxetine could make it worse.

So the answer would be either B or I. But the question is about the cause of the worsening, so it's either due to the drug or stress.

But given that she's started a new medication with a known side effect of causing tremors, that's probably the main factor here. So I would lean towards option B.

The patient is a 70-year-old woman with a long-standing tremor, consistent with essential tremor, which is typically an action tremor that worsens with stress or certain medications. She has experienced a recent exacerbation of her tremor over the past month, coinciding with the initiation of fluoxetine, an SSRI known to cause or exacerbate tremors as a side effect. While stress from bereavement could also contribute to worsening tremor, the temporal association with fluoxetine makes it the most likely cause. Other medications, such as lisinopril, atorvastatin, and ibuprofen, are not commonly associated with tremors, and there is no evidence of hyperthyroidism or other conditions like Parkinson’s disease or multiple sclerosis. Therefore, the worsening tremor is most likely due to an adverse effect of fluoxetine therapy.
