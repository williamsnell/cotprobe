Okay, so I've got this economics problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is about wage guidelines when productivity is increasing and inflation is a factor. Hmm.

The question says productivity is increasing by a uniform 2 percent in all industries. So, productivity growth is 2%. I remember that productivity growth relates to how much output increases per worker. So if productivity is up, companies can produce more without needing more workers, which should mean higher wages or lower prices maybe?

Now, the goal is to hold inflation at 6 percent. Wait, how does wage increase relate to inflation? I think there's a formula or guideline here. Oh right, I remember something about the wage guideline being the sum of productivity growth and the target inflation rate. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, let's think about it. If wages increase by a certain percentage, that can affect inflation because higher wages might lead to higher costs for companies, which could then increase prices. So to keep inflation in check, the wage increase should account for productivity gains and the desired inflation.

I think the formula is something like: wage increase = productivity increase + inflation target. Or is it the other way around? Or maybe it's the sum of productivity and expected inflation.

Wait, no, wait. I think the idea is that if workers are more productive, companies can afford to pay higher wages without raising prices. But if they pay too much, it could cause inflation. So the guideline is to set wages such that the increase is equal to productivity plus the desired inflation rate.

Wait, so the formula would be: Wage Increase = Productivity Growth + Target Inflation Rate.

So in this case, productivity is 2%, target inflation is 6%. So 2 + 6 = 8%? That would make the wage guideline 8%.

Looking at the options, option F is 8%, which would be the correct choice.

Wait, but is that the right approach? Let me think again. Sometimes I get confused between the different guidelines. I recall the idea that nominal wage changes should equal productivity growth plus the inflation target. This is to ensure that real wages grow in line with productivity, and prices don't rise more than the target.

Alternatively, another approach is that the wage increase should be the sum of productivity and the expected inflation rate. So if productivity is 2% and expected inflation is 6%, then wages should go up by 8% to keep up with both.

Yes, that makes sense. So the wage guideline should be 8%, which is option F.

To determine the appropriate wage guideline when productivity is increasing by 2% and inflation is to be held at 6%, we can use the formula:

\[
\text{Wage Increase} = \text{Productivity Growth} + \text{Target Inflation Rate}
\]

Here, productivity growth is 2%, and the target inflation rate is 6%. Adding these together:

\[
\text{Wage Increase} = 2\% + 6\% = 8\%
\]

This ensures that real wages grow in line with productivity while keeping inflation at the target rate. Among the given options, 8% corresponds to option F.
