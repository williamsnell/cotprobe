Okay, so I have this finance question here about calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

The question says that a company has $100,000 in total capital assets. Out of this, $60,000 is equity and $40,000 is debt. The cost of equity is 10%, and the cost of debt is 5%. The corporate tax rate is 21%. I need to find the WACC.

Hmm, I remember that WACC is a formula that combines the cost of equity and the cost of debt, weighted by their proportions in the company's capital structure. But wait, I think the cost of debt is tax-deductible, so I need to account for that.

The formula for WACC, as far as I can recall, is something like:

WACC = (E/V)*Re + (D/V)*Rd*(1 - Tc)

Where:
- E is the market value of equity,
- D is the market value of debt,
- V is E + D,
- Re is the cost of equity,
- Rd is the cost of debt,
- Tc is the corporate tax rate.

Oh wait, right, because interest on debt is tax-deductible, so we multiply Rd by (1 - Tc) to get the after-tax cost of debt.

So in this case, E is 60,000, D is 40,000. Total V is 100,000.

Calculating each part:

First, compute the proportion of equity: E/V = 60,000 / 100,000 = 0.6

Then, the proportion of debt: D/V = 40,000 / 100,000 = 0.4

Now, Re is 10%, which is 0.10. Rd is 5%, so 0.05.

The tax rate Tc is 21%, so 0.21.

So plugging into the formula:

WACC = (0.6 * 0.10) + (0.4 * 0.05 * (1 - 0.21))

Let me compute each term.

First term: 0.6 * 0.10 = 0.06

Second term: Calculate (1 - 0.21) first. 1 - 0.21 is 0.79. Then 0.05 * 0.79 = 0.0395. Then multiply by 0.4: 0.4 * 0.0395 = ?

Wait, wait. Let me compute 0.4 * 0.0395.

0.4 * 0.0395: 0.4 * 0.03 is 0.012, and 0.4 * 0.0095 is 0.0038. So 0.012 + 0.0038 = 0.0158.

So now, the second term is 0.0158.

Adding both terms: 0.06 + 0.0158 = 0.0758.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me check the calculation again. Because 0.4 * 0.0395 is 0.0158. So 0.06 + 0.0158 is 0.0758, which is 7.58%.

Looking at the options, E is 0.0758, which would be the answer. But wait, let me double-check in case I messed up any steps.

Wait another thing, perhaps I missed the tax shield correctly. Let me recompute the after-tax cost of debt.

After-tax Rd = Rd * (1 - Tc) = 0.05 * 0.79 = 0.0395, correct.

Then (D/V) * after-tax Rd: 0.4 * 0.0395 = 0.0158, correct.

Equity part is 0.6 * 0.10 = 0.06, correct.

0.06 + 0.0158 = 0.0758, so 7.58%, which is option E.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 0.0758, so that's the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. I think I might have miscalculated. Because sometimes I get confused whether the formula uses (1-Tc) or Tc. Let me just confirm: the interest is tax-deductible, so it's a shield. So the after-tax cost is Rd*(1-Tc). So yes, I did that correctly.

Hmm, so the calculation seems correct. So the WACC is 7.58%, which is option E.

To calculate the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) for the e-commerce software company, we use the formula:

\[
\text{WACC} = \left(\frac{E}{V}\right)R_e + \left(\frac{D}{V}\right)R_d(1 - T_c)
\]

Where:
- \( E = \$60,000 \) (equity),
- \( D = \$40,000 \) (debt),
- \( V = E + D = \$100,000 \) (total capital),
- \( R_e = 10\% = 0.10 \) (cost of equity),
- \( R_d = 5\% = 0.05 \) (cost of debt),
- \( T_c = 21\% = 0.21 \) (corporate tax rate).

### Step 1: Calculate the proportions of equity and debt
\[
\frac{E}{V} = \frac{60,000}{100,000} = 0.6, \quad \frac{D}{V} = \frac{40,000}{100,000} = 0.4
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the after-tax cost of debt
\[
R_d(1 - T_c) = 0.05 \times (1 - 0.21) = 0.05 \times 0.79 = 0.0395
\]

### Step 3: Compute the weighted costs
\[
\text{Cost of equity component} = 0.6 \times 0.10 = 0.06
\]
\[
\text{Cost of debt component} = 0.4 \times 0.0395 = 0.0158
\]

### Step 4: Add the components to find WACC
\[
\text{WACC} = 0.06 + 0.0158 = 0.0758
\]

### Final Answer:
The WACC of the company is 7.58%, which corresponds to option **E**.
