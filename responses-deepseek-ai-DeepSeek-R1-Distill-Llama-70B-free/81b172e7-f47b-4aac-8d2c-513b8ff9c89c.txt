Okay, so I've got this problem about a three-phase rectifier connected to delta-star transformers. Hmm, I remember that in such configurations, the transformers are usually connected in a way that the secondary is star (Y) connected. But wait, the question says they're delta-star, so primary is delta and secondary is star. Oh right, but the key here is that each Y-leg has an equivalent leakage reactance of 0.25 ohms.

The effective voltage from one secondary leg is 100 volts. I think effective voltage usually refers to the RMS value. So each secondary phase is delivering 100 V RMS. The load current is 100 amperes. I need to calculate the drop due to overlap and the angle of overlap.

Wait, what's the deal with overlap in rectifiers? Oh right, when the current commutates from one phase to another, there's an overlap period where both phases conduct. This causes a voltage drop. The drop increases with the load current and the leakage inductance (reactance in this case).

I remember that the drop voltage (ΔV) is given by ΔV = (I * X) / (tan(θ/2)), where θ is the overlap angle. Or wait, maybe it's ΔV = I * X * (θ in radians), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the formula might involve the angle in some other way.

Wait, another formula comes to mind. The drop due to overlap is I * X * (θ in radians), but when θ is in radians. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the reactance causing a voltage drop as the current changes during the overlap.

Alternatively, I think the formula for the drop is ΔV = I * X * (θ) where θ is in radians. But I'm a bit confused about the exact formula. Let me think.

Wait, I recall that the voltage drop caused by overlap in a three-phase rectifier is given by ΔV = (I * X) * (θ) where θ is the angle in radians. So I need to compute that, but I don't know θ yet. Hmm.

Wait, maybe there's another approach. The angle of overlap (θ) can be found using the formula:

θ = (2 * arccos(V1/V)) ) ... Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, I remember that when there's overlap, the average voltage is lower than the ideal no-load voltage. But in this case, we're given the effective voltage, so maybe that's the secondary voltage under load.

Wait, maybe I should consider the relationship between the on-load voltage and the overlap. The formula for the average voltage when considering overlap is V_avg = V_no_load * (1 - (θ/(2π)) ) ... Or maybe that's for a different configuration. Hmm.

Alternatively, I think there's a formula that relates the drop ΔV to the product of current, reactance, and the overlap angle. Maybe ΔV = I * X * θ, with θ in radians.

Wait, let me try to think about the derivation. During overlap, two phases are conducting, and the current is transferring from one to the other. The voltage across the reactance (X) is I * X, but this is during the overlap period, which is θ radians.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is ΔV = (I * X) * (θ/(2π)) * something. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, I remember that the voltage drop can be determined by the equation ΔV = (I * X) * (θ) where θ is in radians. Wait, but that might not be correct because sometimes the formula considers the time during which the current flows, which would involve the angle.

Alternatively, the formula might be ΔV = (I * X) * (θ/(2π)) * (something else). Wait, perhaps I should use the approximate formula for small angles, where sinθ ≈ θ. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. The overlap angle θ can be found using the formula:

θ = 2 * arccos( (V_avg) / (V_max) )

But I'm not sure if that applies here. Alternatively, the voltage drop is given by ΔV = I * X * (θ) , where θ is in radians.

Let me try to proceed with what I think.

Given:
- X = 0.25 ohms per Y-leg
- Load current I = 100 A
- Effective (secondary) voltage V = 100 V RMS

Wait, maybe I should consider the peak voltage. Since the secondary is star connected, the phase voltage is V_phase = 100 V RMS. So the peak voltage would be V_peak = V_phase * sqrt(2) ≈ 141.42 V.

But wait, the effective voltage is probably the RMS value. So the peak voltage is about 141.4 V.

The voltage drop due to overlap would be ΔV = I * X * (θ) in radians? Or maybe ΔV = I * X * (θ/ (2π)) ) * 2π or something. Hmm.

Wait, I think I'm getting mixed up. Maybe I should use the formula for the drop in voltage due to overlap in a three-phase rectifier, which is ΔV = (I * X) * (θ) where θ is in radians.

But I also need to find θ. How?

Wait, another formula I came across is:

The angle of overlap θ (in radians) is given by:

θ = (2 * I * X) / V_peak

Wait, but that doesn't make sense dimensionally. Because I * X would be volts, and V_peak is volts, so the ratio is dimensionless, but θ is in radians, which is dimensionless. So maybe it's:

θ = (2 * I * X) / V_peak

Wait, let's plug in the numbers.

I is 100 A, X is 0.25 ohms.

So I * X = 100 * 0.25 = 25 V.

V_peak is 100 * sqrt(2) ≈ 141.42 V.

So θ = (2 * 25) / 141.42 ≈ 50 / 141.42 ≈ 0.3535 radians.

Convert radians to degrees: 0.3535 * (180/π) ≈ 20.26 degrees. But wait, that's less than any of the options given. The options have angles around 36 to 41 degrees. So maybe I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for θ is:

θ = (2 * I * X) / V_phase_peak

Wait, wait. The phase voltage is 100 V RMS, so peak is 141.42 V. But in a star connection, each phase's voltage is that.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm thinking of is:

θ = (2 * I * X) / (V_phase_peak * √3) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the general approach.

In a three-phase rectifier, the overlap occurs when two phases are conducting. The reactance between the two phases causes a voltage drop. The voltage on each phase is V = V_max * sin(ωt), and during overlap, the difference in these voltages causes a current change, which in turn causes a voltage drop across the reactances.

The voltage drop is given by ΔV = I * X * (θ), where θ is in radians.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let's see. The average voltage drop would be the product of current, reactance, and the angle in radians. So ΔV = I * X * θ.

Wait, but I need to find θ as well. So perhaps I can relate ΔV and θ through another equation.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the drop is ΔV = (I * X) * (θ) in radians.

But without knowing θ, how can I calculate it?

Wait, another approach: the overlap angle can be determined by the equation:

V_avg = V_peak * (1 - θ/(2π)) 

But I'm not sure if that's accurate. Alternatively, maybe the average voltage is reduced by the drop, so V_avg = V_ideal - ΔV.

Wait, but I'm not sure about this either.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula for the voltage drop in terms of the overlap angle.

Wait, in three-phase rectifiers, the voltage drop due to overlap is given by ΔV = (I * X) * (θ) where θ is the angle in radians.

So, if I can find θ, I can compute the drop. But since I don't know θ, maybe I can find it using the relationship between the applied voltage and the resulting drop.

Wait, perhaps the effective voltage V is related to the drop. Hmm, the effective voltage is 100 V, which is the RMS of the output voltage including the drop.

Wait, no, the effective voltage from one secondary leg is 100 volts. So that's the secondary phase voltage, which is the RMS voltage without considering the drop. But when current flows, the voltage at the rectifier terminals drops due to the reactance.

Wait, perhaps the voltage after the drop would be V_terminal = V_secondary - ΔV.

But I'm not sure if that's the right way to model it.

Alternatively, considering that the secondary voltage is 100 V RMS, but due to the reactance, the voltage drops, leading to a lower output.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to look up the formula.

Alternatively, I remember that the angle of overlap θ can be found using:

θ = 2 * arccos( (V_avg) / (V_max) )

But I'm not certain about this. If that's the case, then I need to find V_avg, which would be the average voltage under load.

Wait, but I don't know the average voltage. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the effective voltage given (100 V) is the RMS voltage on the secondary, which is the same as the RMS voltage at the rectifier input. But when current flows, the voltage drops due to the reactance, so the actual RMS voltage at the terminals is lower.

Wait, but in a rectifier, the output is DC, but the question is about the drop in the voltage due to overlap. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is ΔV = (I * X) * (θ) where θ is in radians.

So, to find θ, perhaps I can relate it to the secondary voltage.

Wait, the secondary phase voltage is V = 100 V RMS, which is V_rms = V_peak / sqrt(2). So V_peak = 100 * sqrt(2) ≈ 141.42 V.

The maximum possible voltage without any drop would be V_max. But the drop ΔV is I * X * θ.

Wait, but without knowing θ, I can't find ΔV. Hmm. So perhaps I need to find θ in terms of known quantities.

Another approach: The overlap occurs when the current is commutating between two phases. The reactance X causes a voltage drop as the current changes. The time (or angle) during which this happens is the overlap angle θ.

The voltage across the reactance during overlap is L * (di/dt), but since we're dealing with reactance X = ωL, and ω = 2πf, but without frequency given, maybe it's not the right path.

Wait, perhaps I can model the current during overlap. The current starts at zero and rises to the load current I during the overlap angle θ. So the change in current is I, and the time for this change is θ/(ω) = θ/(2πf). But without frequency, this seems tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the voltage drop is given by ΔV = I * X * (θ/(2π)) * (something). Wait, I'm getting stuck.

Maybe I should try to look for some example problems or standard formulas.

Wait, I found a formula in my notes: The drop in voltage due to overlap in a three-phase rectifier is ΔV = (I * X) * (θ) where θ is in radians.

So, if I can find θ, I can compute ΔV.

But how to find θ?

Another formula I remember is:

θ = (2 * I * X) / (V_peak)

Wait, let's try that.

V_peak is 100 * sqrt(2) ≈ 141.42 V.

I = 100 A, X = 0.25 Ω.

So θ = (2 * 100 * 0.25) / 141.42 = (50) / 141.42 ≈ 0.3535 radians.

Convert to degrees: 0.3535 * (180/π) ≈ 20.26 degrees.

But looking at the options, the angles are all above 35 degrees. So this can't be right. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is θ = (I * X) / (V_peak) * 180/π ?

Wait, (100 * 0.25) / (141.42) ≈ 25 / 141.42 ≈ 0.1768 radians. Which is about 10.1 degrees. Even smaller.

Hmm, maybe I should think differently. Perhaps I need to consider that the reactance is per leg, and each phase is connected in a certain way.

Wait, the transformers are delta-star connected, so each secondary leg is star-connected. The reactance per Y-leg is 0.25 ohms, which I think is the leakage reactance from the transformer.

Wait, in a star connection, each phase's voltage is V_phase, and the current flows through the reactances. So perhaps the reactance seen by each phase is X = 0.25 ohms.

So, when current flows, the voltage drop is I * X, but this is instantaneous. But during overlap, the drop is more involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is ΔV = (I * X) * (θ/(2π)) * π. Because the overlap occurs over θ radians, which is a fraction of the total 2π cycle.

Wait, maybe the average drop is (I * X) * (θ/(2π)) ), but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the drop is ΔV = (I * X) * (θ/(2π)) * (2π/3) ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is ΔV = I * X * (θ) in radians.

But earlier that gave a lower angle than the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in that approach.

Wait, another thought: The reactance per leg is 0.25 ohms, but in a three-phase system, the line-to-line voltage is higher. Since the secondary is star-connected, the phase voltage is 100 V, but the line voltage would be 100 * sqrt(3) ≈ 173.2 V.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that plays into the calculation here.

Alternatively, perhaps the voltage across each reactance is the phase voltage, so V = 100 V RMS, which is 141.42 V peak.

Wait, let's think in terms of the inductance. The reactance X = ωL, where ω is 2πf. But without knowing the frequency, maybe that's not helpful.

Wait, maybe the formula for the angle of overlap θ is given by:

θ = (2 * I * X) / (V_phase_peak)

So plugging in:

I=100, X=0.25, V_phase_peak=141.42 V.

θ = (2 * 100 * 0.25) / 141.42 → (50)/141.42 ≈ 0.3535 radians → approx 20 degrees.

But again, that's lower than the options given.

So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Maybe the correct formula is:

θ = (I * X) / (V_phase_peak) ) * (180/π)

Wait, (100 * 0.25) / 141.42 → 25 / 141.42 ≈ 0.1768 radians → 10.1 degrees. That's even worse.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to think of another approach.

Wait, perhaps the drop is given by ΔV = (I * X) * (θ) in radians, and the angle θ can be found using the formula θ = (2 * I * X)/(V_phase_peak).

Wait, but that gives θ ≈ 0.3535 radians, as before.

So, if ΔV = I * X * θ → 100 * 0.25 * 0.3535 ≈ 8.8375 V.

Looking at the options, option H is 9.8 V, which is close but not exact. Option J is 10.5 V. Hmm.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the correct formula is ΔV = (I * X) * (θ), but θ is in radians.

Wait, but if the angle is small, as I calculated, the drop would be about 8.8 volts. But the options don't have that.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the reactance is per leg, and in a three-phase system, each phase's reactance is in the path, so perhaps the effective reactance is different. Or maybe it's the line reactance that's important.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is missing a factor. Let's see. Maybe the correct formula is ΔV = (I * X) * (θ/π), where θ is in radians.

Wait, if θ is 0.3535 radians, then ΔV would be 100 * 0.25 * (0.3535/π) ≈ 25 * 0.1124 ≈ 2.81 V. No, that's too low.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the average voltage drop instead of the peak. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The overlap causes a drop in the voltage, and the formula for the drop is ΔV = (I * X) * (θ) in radians. So, I need to compute θ, but I don't know it yet. However, perhaps I can find another equation involving ΔV and θ.

Wait, perhaps the maximum possible voltage is when there's no overlap (θ=0), which would be V_max. The actual voltage is V_actual = V_max - ΔV.

But without knowing V_max, I can't proceed.

Wait, but given that the effective voltage is 100 V RMS, perhaps that's the actual voltage after the drop. So V_actual = 100 V RMS.

Wait, but then V_max is higher, and the drop is the difference. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the effective voltage includes the drop, so I need to calculate the drop based on the overlap, which depends on the current and reactance.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another way.

I found a formula in some notes: The angle of overlap θ is given by:

θ = (2 I X) / V_m

where V_m is the maximum voltage per phase.

So, V_m is 100 * sqrt(2) ≈ 141.42 V.

So
