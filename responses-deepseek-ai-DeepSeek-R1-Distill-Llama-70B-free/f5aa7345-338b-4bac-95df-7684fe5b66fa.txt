Alright, let me try to figure out this life insurance question. Okay, so the question is about comparing the cost of a $5,000 20-payment life insurance policy for two men: one is 25 years old, and the other is 45. They both live for the term of the policy, so we don't have to worry about early death or anything like that. 

Hmm, I remember that life insurance policies can be term life or whole life, but this one says "20-payment," which makes me think it's a whole life policy where you pay premiums for 20 years, and then it's paid up. Or maybe it's a term policy that covers 20 years. Either way, the key is that it's a 20-year payment plan.

Wait, the question is about the total cost. So the cost would be the sum of all the premiums paid over those 20 years. But wait, I'm not sure if the policy's structure affects that. Oh, right, the policy might have different premium structures based on age, but usually, for whole life, the premium is level, meaning you pay the same amount each year.

But wait, the question doesn't specify whether the premium is level or not. Oh, but in a 20-payment life insurance policy, I think the premiums are usually paid level, so each payment is the same amount each year for 20 years. So the total cost would be 20 times the annual premium.

But wait, the question is comparing two people of different ages. So the cost depends on the premium each pays. Younger people typically have lower premiums because they're less likely to die, so the insurance company takes on less risk. So the 25-year-old would have a lower premium than the 45-year-old.

Wait, but the question is about the total cost. So the 25-year-old's policy would cost less in total over 20 years because each premium is lower. So the total cost for the younger man is less than for the older man.

Looking at the options, I should look for an option where the first number is lower than the second. Let me scan the options.

Option A: $3649 and $2207. Wait, that's 2207 higher for the second. No, because the first is higher. So 25-year-old has 3649, 45 has 2207. That can't be right because the older should pay more.

Option B: 2207 and 5000. Hmm, 2207 is less than 5000. So 25-year-old pays 2207, 45 pays 5000. That makes sense because the older pays more. But wait, are the policies the same? Both are $5,000 policies, so the death benefit is same, but the premium varies with age.

Option C: $110.35 and $182.45. This seems like monthly payments, but the question is about total cost. So 20 years is 240 months. So 110.35*240= let's see, 110*240=26400, which is way higher than the options. So maybe these are annual payments? 110.35 *20= $2207, 182.45*20= approx $3649. So then the total would be 2207 and 3649. Which would correspond to 25-year-old paying 2207 and 45 paying 3649. So the totals would be 2207 and 3649, but looking at the options, that's option H, which is 2207 and 3649. So that would mean the 25-year-old's total is 2207, the 45-year-old's is 3649. So the answer would be H. But wait, the way the options are presented, the first number is for the 25-year-old, right? So the question is comparing the cost for the young man (25) versus the older (45). So the young man's total is 2207, the older is 3649. So the correct pair is 2207 and 3649, which is option H.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option H is 2207 and 3649, which is correct. So the 25-year-old pays less in total because each premium is lower.

Alternatively, some might think that the present value of the payments matters, but the question says "assuming each lived for the term of the policy," which implies that the total cost is just the sum of the premiums, not considering the time value of money. So we don't need to calculate present values, just the total amount paid over 20 years.

So the correct answer is H: $2207 and $3649.

To determine the total cost of a $5,000 20-payment life insurance policy for a 25-year-old man and a 45-year-old man, we compare the premiums paid over the 20-year term. Life insurance premiums are typically higher for older individuals due to increased mortality risk. Therefore, the 25-year-old will pay a lower total amount compared to the 45-year-old.

The total cost is calculated by summing the premiums paid over 20 years. The question does not specify the time value of money, so we assume the total cost is the sum of level annual premiums. Based on the options provided, the correct comparison is:

- The 25-year-old pays a total of **$2,207**.
- The 45-year-old pays a total of **$3,649**.

This corresponds to **Option H: $2,207 and $3,649**.
