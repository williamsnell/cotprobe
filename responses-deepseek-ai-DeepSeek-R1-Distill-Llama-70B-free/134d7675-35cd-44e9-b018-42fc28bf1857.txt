Okay, so I've got this problem about Ted Logan's medical expenses and Medicare coverage. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

So, Ted was in the hospital for 72 days at $52 a day. Then he spent 30 days in a convalescent home at $13 a day. After that, a visiting nurse came three times a week for ten weeks, costing $12 each call. Plus, he has doctor's bills totaling $1335. 

He's covered by Medicare, and I need to find his total expenses, what Medicare pays, and what he has to pay out of pocket.

First, let's break down each expense and calculate the total without considering Medicare. Then I'll apply the Medicare coverage to each part to see how much is covered and what's left for Ted.

Let's start with the hospital stay. 72 days at $52 per day. So 72 * 52. Hmm, 70*52 is 3640, and 2*52 is 104, so total $3744.

Next, the convalescent home: 30 days at $13 each. 30 *13 is 390.

Visiting nurse: three times a week for ten weeks. So that's 3*10=30 visits. Each visit is $12, so 30*12=360.

Doctor's bills are $1335.

Adding all these up: 3744 (hospital) + 390 (convalescent) = 4134. Then 360 (nurse) +1335 (doctors) = 1695. So total is 4134 + 1695 = 5829. Wait, but let me check the numbers again because I might have misread.

Wait, the options don't have 5829 as an option. Hmm. Let me recheck the math.

Wait, 72 days *52: Let's calculate that again. 72 *50 is 3600, and 72 *2 is 144. So 3600+144=3744. That's correct.

30 days *13: Yeah, 390. Correct.

Visiting nurse: 3 times a week for 10 weeks is 30 visits. 30*12=360. Correct.

Doctors: $1335. So total is 3744 + 390 = 4134, plus 360 = 4494, plus 1335 = 5829. But the options don't have 5829. Wait, looking at the options, option E is total $5985. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated something. Let's see:

Hospital: 72 *52 = 3744.

Convalescent: 30 *13 = 390.

Nurse: 3 * 10 weeks =30, 30 *12 =360.

Doctors:1335.

So 3744 +390 is 4134, +360 is 4494, +1335 is 5829. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the days in the hospital are 72 days, but maybe the calculation is different. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something, but let's proceed and see.

Now, let's go through each expense and see what Medicare covers.

Medicare Coverage Schedule:

1. Hospitalization: $0 for first $72 of expense. Wait, no, I think it's the first 72 dollars? Or the first 72 days? Wait, no, the wording is "$0 for first $72 of expense." Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's a typo, and they mean the first 72 days at $0? Or perhaps the first 72 dollars are covered at no cost. Hmm, let me read it again.

The coverage says:

Hospitalization: $0 for first $72 of expense. Up to $75 per day for up to 60 days thereafter, and up to $34 per day thereafter.

Wait, that wording is a bit confusing. So, the first $72 of expense is covered at $0, meaning Ted pays nothing for the first $72. Then, after that, for the next 60 days, Medicare pays up to $75 per day. After that, up to $34 per day.

So, for hospitalization, Ted's cost is 72 days at $52 each. Let's compute the total hospital bill first: 72 *52 =3744.

Now, Medicare's coverage:

- First $72: Ted pays nothing, Medicare covers.

But wait, that would mean the first $72 is free, but the hospital bill is per day, so perhaps it's the first 72 dollars, not days. Oh, I think that's how it's worded: first $72 of expense, so the first $72 is free, regardless of days.

So, the first $72 is covered by Medicare, so Ted pays nothing for that part. The remaining hospital bill is 3744 -72 = $3672.

Now, for the remaining days, which I think is 72 days, but after the first $72, the next part is up to 60 days with Medicare paying up to $75 per day. Wait, but the total days are 72. So, after the first $72, which is the initial part, the remaining days are 72 days, but perhaps the 60 days apply after that.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the coverage again.

Hospitalization:

- $0 for first $72 of expense.

Then, up to $75 per day for up to 60 days thereafter.

And up to $34 per day thereafter.

Wait, perhaps it's structured in terms of days, not dollars. Maybe the first 72 days are covered at $0, but that seems unlikely because the first part says "$0 for first $72 of expense." Hmm, perhaps it's a cost-based coverage, not day-based.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the first 72 dollars, then up to 60 days at $75 per day, and beyond that, $34 per day.

Wait, let's think in terms of the total hospital bill. Ted's bill is $3744.

Medicare's coverage:

- First $72: Ted pays $0.

Then, for the next part, up to $75 per day for 60 days. So that's 60 days at $75 each, which is 60*75=4500.

So, the first $72 is covered, then Medicare covers up to $75 per day for the next 60 days. So the total Medicare coverage for the hospital would be 72 + (60*75) = 72+4500=4572. But wait, that's in dollars, not days. Ted's total is 3744, which is less than 72 + 60*75 = 4572. So, the total hospital bill is 3744. So, the first 72 is covered by Medicare, and the remaining is 3744-72=3672. Now, for the next 60 days, which would be 60*52=3120. But wait, that's days, but the coverage is per day up to $75. So, for each day beyond the first $72, Medicare pays up to $75, but Ted's cost per day is $52, which is less than $75. So, for each day beyond the first $72, Medicare would pay the full $52, because that's what Ted is charged, but up to the $75 limit.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach this differently.

Hospital bill: 72 days * $52/day = $3744.

Medicare's hospital coverage:

- First $72 of the expense is covered (Ted pays $0).

- Then, for the next 60 days (so days 2 to 61?), Medicare pays up to $75 per day.

But wait, Ted's hospital stay is 72 days. So, the first $72 is covered. Then, for days beyond that, up to 60 days, Medicare pays up to $75 per day. Wait, but the total days are 72, so the first day is $52, which is part of the first $72. So the first $72 is day 1's $52 and maybe part of day 2? Because 52 + next day's 52 would be $104, which exceeds $72. Hmm, perhaps the first $72 is a deductible, so Ted pays the first $72, and then Medicare starts paying. Or wait, the coverage says "$0 for first $72 of expense", meaning Ted doesn't pay anything for the first $72; Medicare covers it.

Wait, no, the way it's phrased is a bit confusing. Let me think again: Coverage is "$0 for first $72 of expense." So Ted's first $72 of hospital bills are free, paid by Medicare. Then, for the next 60 days, Medicare pays up to $75 per day. After that, up to $34 per day.

So, let's compute Ted's hospital cost and Medicare's payment.

Total hospital bill: $3744.

Medicare pays:

- First $72: so that's covered.

- Then, for the next 60 days: each day Medicare pays up to $75. Ted's cost per day is $52, so Medicare would pay $52 per day for those days, since it's less than $75. So for 60 days, Medicare pays 60 *52 = 3120.

Wait, but wait, the total days after the first $72 is 72 days minus however many days the first $72 covers. Wait, perhaps the first $72 is a flat amount, not per day. So, the first $72 of the total bill is covered by Medicare. So, the total bill is $3744. So, Medicare covers $72, and then for the remaining $3744 -72 = $3672, they cover up to 60 days at $75 per day.

Wait, but that approach may not align with the days. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the coverage is structured as:

- First, any hospital stay: the first $72 is paid by Medicare, so Ted owes nothing for that part.

- Then, for days 1-60: Medicare pays up to $75 per day, but since Ted's per day is $52, they pay $52/day for up to 60 days.

- Beyond 60 days, they pay up to $34/day.

Wait, but Ted's stay is 72 days. So, let's break it down.

First $72 of the total bill is covered by Medicare, so Ted doesn't pay that. The remaining is 3744 -72 = 3672.

Now, for the first 60 days (but wait, the first $72 may cover part of that), perhaps it's better to think in terms of days beyond the deductible.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

- The first $72 is a deductible: Ted pays $72, and then Medicare starts paying.

Wait, but the way the problem is phrased, it's "coverage", so it's what Medicare pays. So:

1. Hospitalization: 

   - Medicare pays $0 for the first $72 of expense.

   - Then, up to $75 per day for up to 60 days.

   - Then, up to $34 per day beyond that.

Wait, perhaps the first $72 is what Ted has to pay out of pocket. So, Ted pays the first $72, then Medicare pays up to $75 per day for the next 60 days, and beyond that, up to $34 per day.

Wait, but the problem says "Coverage" which is what Medicare pays, so perhaps:

- For the first $72 of the hospital bill, Medicare pays nothing, so Ted pays that.

- Then, for the next 60 days, Medicare pays up to $75 per day.

- Beyond that, up to $34 per day.

So, let's compute that.

Ted's hospital bill: $3744.

Medicare's payment:

- First $72: Ted pays this.

- Days 1-60: Medicare pays up to $75 per day. Since Ted's daily rate is $52, which is less than $75, Medicare pays $52/day for 60 days: 60 *52 = 3120.

- Days 61-72: 12 days. Medicare pays up to $34/day. Ted's rate is $52, so Medicare pays $34 for each of these 12 days: 12*34=408.

So, total Medicare payment for hospital: 3120 +408 = 3528.

But wait, wait: the first $72 is a part of the total bill. So, the total bill is 3744. Ted pays the first 72, and Medicare pays the rest as per the rates.

Wait, perhaps it's better to structure it as:

Total hospital bill: 3744.

Ted's payment:

- First 72: Ted pays 72.

- Then, for days 1-60: Medicare pays up to 75/day, so Ted's cost is 0 for those days beyond the first 72.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should approach it step by step.

Let me model it as:

1. Hospitalization:

   a. First $72: Medicare pays nothing, so Ted pays $72.

   b. Next 60 days: Medicare pays up to $75 per day. Ted's cost per day is $52, so Medicare pays the full $52 for each day. So, for 60 days, Medicare pays 60 *52=3120.

   c. Days beyond 60: Ted stayed 72 days, so 72-60=12 days. Medicare pays up to $34 per day. So 12*34=408.

   So, total Medicare payment for hospital: 3120 +408=3528.

   Ted's payment for hospital: 72 (from part a) plus any days beyond 60 where Medicare's payment is less than Ted's cost.

Wait, no, because in part b and c, Medicare is paying the amounts, so Ted doesn't pay anything beyond the first $72. So, Ted's total cost for hospital is $72, and Medicare pays 3528. But wait, the total hospital bill is 3744. So, 72 (Ted) +3528 (Medicare) = 3600, which is less than 3744. So, there's a discrepancy here. Hmm, that can't be right.

Wait a minute, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the coverage. Let me re-examine the coverage description.

The coverage says:

1. Hospitalization:

   - $0 for first $72 of expense.

   So, Medicare pays nothing for the first $72; Ted pays that.

   - Up to $75 per day for up to 60 days thereafter.

   So, after the first $72, for the next 60 days, Medicare pays up to $75 per day.

   - Up to $34 per day thereafter.

So, the structure is:

- Ted pays the first $72.

- Then, Medicare pays for the next 60 days at up to $75/day.

- Beyond that, Medicare pays up to $34/day.

So, let's compute this.

Ted's hospital bill: 72 days *52 =3744.

Ted's payment:

- First $72.

Medicare's payment:

- Next 60 days: 60 *52 =3120 (since 52 <=75)

- Then, days 61-72: 12 days. 12 *34=408.

So, Medicare pays 3120 +408=3528.

Total payments: Ted pays 72, Medicare pays 3528. 72+3528=3600. But the total bill is 3744, so 3744-3600=144. So, there's an uncovered amount of $144. Does Ted pay that?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Because the total after Ted's $72 and Medicare's 3528 is 3600, which is less than 3744. So, the remaining 3744-3600=144 would be Ted's responsibility. But why?

Wait, perhaps the days beyond 60 are covered at $34 per day, but Ted's daily cost is $52, so for those 12 days, Medicare pays 34, Ted pays the remaining 52-34=18 per day. So, 12 days *18=216.

Wait, that makes more sense. Let me try that approach.

Hospital bill: 72 days *52=3744.

Ted's payment:

- First $72.

- Days 61-72: 12 days. Each day, Medicare pays $34, so Ted pays 52-34=18 each day. So 12*18=216.

Total Ted pays:72+216=288.

Medicare's payment:

- Days 1-60: 60 days *52=3120.

- Days 61-72:12 days *34=408.

So, Medicare pays 3120+408=3528.

Total covered: 3528. Ted's payments:288.

Total:3528+288=3816. But the total bill is 3744, which is less than 3816. That can't be right. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the initial $72 is a deductible that Ted must pay, and then Medicare covers the rest according to their rates.

So, the hospital bill is 3744.

Ted pays the first 72.

The remaining is 3744-72=3672.

Now, for the first 60 days after the deductible, Medicare pays up to 75 per day. But wait, the 60 days may include all days except the first part. Alternatively, perhaps the 60 days are after the deductible.

Wait, perhaps the deductible is $72, which is the first part Ted pays. Then, for the next 60 days, Medicare pays up to $75 per day, but since Ted's daily rate is 52, which is less than 75, Medicare pays 52 per day for 60 days. Beyond that, 34 per day.

So, let's see:

Total days:72.

First, Ted pays $72 (the deductible). So, that's 72/52 ≈1.384 days. So, about 1 day and some. So, the remaining 72 -1.384 ≈70.616 days are covered by Medicare.

But this is getting too complicated. Maybe a better approach is to think in terms of the total cost beyond the deductible.

Alternatively, perhaps the Medicare coverage is structured as:

- The first $72 is Ted's responsibility.

- Then, for the next 60 days, Medicare pays up to $75 per day. So, the next 60 days would cost 60*75=4500, but Ted's actual cost is 60*52=3120. So, Medicare would pay 3120.

- Then, any days beyond that (72-60=12 days), Medicare pays up to 34 per day, so 12*34=408.

So, total Medicare payment:3120 +408=3528.

Ted's payment:72 (deductible) + any amount beyond what Medicare covers for days beyond 60.

Wait, for days beyond 60, the hospital charges 52 per day, but
