Okay, so I've got this question about how marital discord affects children's behavior. Let me think through it. The question is about Carol and Jim, who are having marital difficulties, and they have two school-aged kids, a boy and a girl. The question is asking, based on meta-analyses of research, what's expected regarding the children's behavior problems.

Hmm, I remember reading that marital problems can affect children, but I'm not sure about the specifics, like if it affects boys and girls differently. I think that in general, kids from high-conflict homes might have more behavior issues, but does it vary by gender?

Wait, I recall something about gender differences. I think girls and boys might manifest problems differently. Like, maybe boys act out more externally, while girls might internalize their issues. But does that mean one is more likely than the other to have immediate problems?

So the options are from A to J. Let me look at the options:

Option A says the girl is more likely than the boy to have an immediate problem. Option E says the opposite, the boy is more likely. Option I says both are equally likely. Others talk about less likely or neither.

I think research suggests that boys might be more likely to show externalizing behaviors, like acting out, which are immediate. Girls might show internalizing issues, like anxiety or depression, which might not be as immediately noticeable or might develop later.

So, in the context of the question, which is about immediate behavior problems, maybe the boy is more likely to manifest these than the girl. So that would point to option E.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Another thought: some studies say that overall, children from discordant marriages have more behavior issues, but gender differences might vary. But the meta-analysis would pool all studies, so maybe it's more about whether there's an overall effect regardless of gender.

Alternatively, if the meta-analysis found that both genders are affected but in different ways, the question is about immediate problems. So if boys show more external (immediate) issues, then E makes sense.

So looking at the options, E says the boy is more likely than the girl to have an immediate problem. That seems right based on what I remember about externalizing vs internalizing behaviors.

The question examines the relationship between marital discord and child behavior problems, focusing on gender differences. Research suggests that children from high-conflict homes are more likely to exhibit behavior problems, with boys often showing externalizing behaviors (e.g., acting out) and girls internalizing issues (e.g., anxiety). Since the question specifically asks about immediate behavior problems, boys are more likely to manifest these due to their tendency toward externalizing behaviors. 

Option E aligns with this reasoning, as it states that the boy is more likely than the girl to exhibit immediate behavior problems.

Answer: E
