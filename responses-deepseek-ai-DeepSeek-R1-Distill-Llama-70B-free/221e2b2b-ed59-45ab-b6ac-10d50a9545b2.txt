Options:

Okay, so I have this question about the influence of the five early schools of thought on modern psychology, and I need to choose the correct answer from options A to J. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the five early schools are Structuralism, Functionalism, Behaviorism, Psychoanalysis, and Gestalt Psychology. Each of these had different focuses and methodologies. For example, Structuralism was about breaking down the mind into basic components, while Functionalism focused on the purpose of mental processes. Behaviorism looked at observable behaviors, Psychoanalysis at the unconscious mind, and Gestalt on the whole of experiences.

Now, the question is about their influence on modern psychology. I should consider whether each of these schools is completely obsolete or if they've contributed in some way. I know that modern psychology is an integration of various approaches. For example, cognitive psychology, which is huge today, came out of the ashes of Behaviorism when they started looking at internal processes again. So Behaviorism's emphasis on observable behavior and scientific methods probably influenced the development of more rigorous research methods in modern psychology.

Psychoanalysis, while maybe not as dominant, still affects areas like counseling and certain therapeutic approaches. Gestalt principles are used in perception studies and design. Functionalism's emphasis on function and purpose relates to modern studies on how the mind adapts and solves problems.

So looking at the answer options:

Option E says each early school had some beneficial effect. That sounds right because each contributed something, even if their original forms aren't dominant now.

Options A and D suggest they're irrelevant or rejected, which doesn't fit. Option C says all are obsolete, but that's not true since their ideas evolved. Option G says replaced by a unified theory, which isn't the case—psychology has many theories and approaches. Option H says three dominate, but I'm not sure which three, and it's possible more than three have influences. Option I and J limit it to one or two, which seems too narrow.

So the correct answer is E.

The five early schools of thought—Structuralism, Functionalism, Behaviorism, Psychoanalysis, and Gestalt Psychology—each contributed uniquely to the development of modern psychology. While their original forms may not dominate today, their principles and methodologies have evolved and influenced various areas of psychological research and practice. For example, Behaviorism's emphasis on scientific methods and observable behavior shaped modern research practices, while Psychoanalysis continues to impact therapeutic approaches. Similarly, Gestalt principles inform studies on perception, and Functionalism's focus on mental processes' purposes aligns with modern cognitive psychology. Thus, each school has had a beneficial effect on shaping psychology as we know it today.

Answer: E
