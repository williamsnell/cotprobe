Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about two motorcycles. Let me try to break it down step by step. Okay, the setup is that both motorcycles are at rest initially, and they're separated by 24.5 feet. They start moving in the same direction at the same time. The one in the back (so the faster one) has an acceleration of 3 ft/s², and the front one has a slower acceleration of 2 ft/s². There are three parts to the question: (a) the time it takes for the faster cycle to overtake the slower one, (b) how far the faster one goes before catching up, and (c) their speeds at that time.

Hmm, I remember that when two objects are moving with constant accelerations, their positions can be described using the equation of motion. The general equation is s = ut + (1/2)at², where u is the initial velocity, which is zero here because both start from rest. So the position equations will be based on their accelerations.

Let me denote the position of each motorcycle as a function of time. Let's say t is the time until overtaking happens.

For the faster motorcycle (the one catching up), the position would be s1 = 0.5 * a1 * t². Here, a1 is 3 ft/s², so s1 = 0.5 * 3 * t² = 1.5 t².

For the slower motorcycle (in front), its position is s2 = 0.5 * a2 * t², where a2 is 2 ft/s². So s2 = 0.5 * 2 * t² = t².

Wait, but wait, the slower motorcycle is initially ahead by 24.5 feet. Oh right, so the faster one starts behind. So the initial separation is 24.5 ft. That means that at time t=0, s2 is 24.5 ft, but wait, no. Wait, no, both start from rest, but the front one is already ahead by 24.5 ft. So the position equations must account for that initial separation.

Ah, right. So the position of the front motorcycle is s2 = 24.5 + (1/2)*a2*t². Wait, no. Wait, if both start at the same time, but the front one is already ahead, so at t=0, s2 =24.5 ft, and s1=0. Then, as they accelerate, their positions change.

Wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. Oh wait, wait, no. Let me think again. Both start from rest, but they're separated by 24.5 ft. So the front motorcycle is at position 24.5 ft, and the back one is at position 0. So their positions as functions of time are:

s1 = 0.5 * a1 * t² = 0.5 * 3 * t² = 1.5 t².

s2 = 24.5 + 0.5 * a2 * t² = 24.5 + 0.5 * 2 * t² = 24.5 + t².

When the faster overtakes the slower, their positions are equal. So s1 = s2. Therefore:

1.5 t² = 24.5 + t².

Subtracting t² from both sides gives 0.5 t² =24.5. Then t² =49, so t=7 seconds. Oh wait, that's part (a): 7 seconds. Let me check the options. Option B says (a)7, (b)75, etc. Option E also (a)7, but part (b) is 73.5. Hmm.

Wait, okay, so (a) is 7 seconds. That's part (a).

Now part (b): how far does the faster machine go before it catches up? That's s1 at t=7. So s1 =1.5*(7)^2. 7 squared is 49, times 1.5 is 73.5 feet. Wait, but looking at the options, let's check. Option B says (b)75, option E says 73.5. So that would suggest that (b) is 73.5, but wait, let me make sure. Hmm, wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Because the front motorcycle is moving, so maybe I should calculate the distance each has moved and sum it, but no, wait, the position of the faster is s1, which is 1.5 t². At t=7, that's 1.5*49=73.5 ft. So (b) is 73.5 ft.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the initial separation is 24.5 ft. So when the faster catches up, they've covered the initial 24.5 ft plus whatever the front has moved. Maybe another way to think: the faster's distance is s1, the front's is s2. So s1 = s2 when they meet. So s1 is 73.5. So (b) is 73.5 ft. So in the options, looking for (a)7, (b)73.5. Let me look. Option E has (a)7, (b)73.5, and (c) 21 and 14 ft/s. But wait, what's part (c)?

Part (c): How fast is each cycle going at that time. So their velocities at t=7 seconds. Velocity is v = a*t. So the faster cycle (back one) has a=3, so v =3*7=21 ft/s. The front one has a=2, so v=2*7=14 ft/s. So part (c) is 21 and 14. So option E has (c) 21 and 14, which matches.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because I'm seeing that the options might have other answers. Let me review the options again. Option E: (a)7, (b)73.5, (c)21 and 14. That's correct according to my calculations. But wait, let me make sure about the setup again.

Wait, the initial separation is 24.5 ft. So s2 =24.5 + (1/2)*2*t² =24.5 + t². s1= 1.5 t². Setting them equal: 1.5 t² =24.5 + t². 0.5 t²=24.5 → t²=49 → t=7. So yes, that's correct.

So (a) is 7, (b) is 73.5, (c) 21 and 14. Looking at the options, option E is (a)7, (b)73.5, (c)21 and 14. So that should be the correct answer.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because another option, like option J, has (a)7.5, which is not matching my calculation. So I think the correct option is E.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, in these problems, the initial position is considered differently. Did I assign s1 and s2 correctly? Let me think again. The back motorcycle is s1, which starts at 0, and the front is at 24.5. So yes, s1 would have to cover 24.5 plus the distance the front motorcycle moves. So yes, the setup is correct.

So the correct answer should be option E.

To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the two motorcycles using their equations of motion. Both start from rest, so their positions as functions of time are given by:

- **Faster motorcycle (rear):**  
  \( s_1 = \frac{1}{2} a_1 t^2 = 1.5 t^2 \), where \( a_1 = 3 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \).

- **Slower motorcycle (front):**  
  \( s_2 = 24.5 + \frac{1}{2} a_2 t^2 = 24.5 + t^2 \), where \( a_2 = 2 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \).

The faster motorcycle overtakes the slower one when \( s_1 = s_2 \). Setting the equations equal:

\[
1.5 t^2 = 24.5 + t^2
\]

Subtracting \( t^2 \) from both sides:

\[
0.5 t^2 = 24.5
\]

Solving for \( t^2 \):

\[
t^2 = 49 \quad \Rightarrow \quad t = 7 \, \text{seconds}.
\]

Thus, the time it takes for the faster motorcycle to overtake the slower one is \( t = 7 \, \text{seconds} \).

Next, we calculate how far the faster motorcycle travels before overtaking. Substituting \( t = 7 \, \text{seconds} \) into \( s_1 \):

\[
s_1 = 1.5 t^2 = 1.5 (7)^2 = 1.5 (49) = 73.5 \, \text{ft}.
\]

So, the faster motorcycle travels \( 73.5 \, \text{ft} \) before catching up.

Finally, we determine the speeds of both motorcycles at \( t = 7 \, \text{seconds} \). The velocity of an object under constant acceleration is given by \( v = a t \):

- **Faster motorcycle:**  
  \( v_1 = a_1 t = 3 (7) = 21 \, \text{ft/s} \).

- **Slower motorcycle:**  
  \( v_2 = a_2 t = 2 (7) = 14 \, \text{ft/s} \).

Thus, at the time of overtaking, the faster motorcycle is traveling at \( 21 \, \text{ft/s} \), and the slower motorcycle is traveling at \( 14 \, \text{ft/s} \).

Comparing these results with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**Option E:**  
(a) \( 7 \, \text{seconds} \), (b) \( 73.5 \, \text{ft} \), (c) \( 21 \, \text{ft/s} \) and \( 14 \, \text{ft/s} \).
