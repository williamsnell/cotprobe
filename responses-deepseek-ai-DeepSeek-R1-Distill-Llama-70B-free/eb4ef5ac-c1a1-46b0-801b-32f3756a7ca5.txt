Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about characteristics of a developed country. I need to figure out which option is correct. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I should remember what defines a developed country. From what I've studied, developed countries are typically those with high-income economies, advanced infrastructure, and a high standard of living. They usually have a high Human Development Index (HDI), which includes factors like life expectancy, education, and income.

Looking at the options provided:

Option A: Over 50% of workforce engaged in agriculture. Hmm, I think in developed countries, most people work in services or industry, not agriculture. So this might be more typical of developing or underdeveloped countries where agriculture is a major part of the economy. So A is probably not the right answer.

Option B: High levels of political instability. Developed countries usually have stable political systems. Political instability is more common in developing nations. So B doesn't seem right either.

Option C: Majority of the population lives in rural areas. I remember that developed countries have more urbanization. People move to cities for better jobs and services. So the majority would live in urban areas, making C incorrect.

Option D: Women held in inferior place in society. Developed countries generally promote gender equality and women's rights. They have laws against discrimination and higher female participation in the workforce and politics. So D is probably not a characteristic of a developed country.

Option E: Lower levels of literacy and education. No, developed countries have high literacy rates and invest heavily in education. They often have compulsory education and high-quality universities. So E is incorrect.

Option F: High birth and death rates. Developed countries usually have lower birth and death rates. High birth rates are more common in developing countries. So F is not the right choice.

Option G: Main disease related to age and lifestyle. That sounds familiar. In developed countries, people tend to live longer, so diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and cancers, which are related to age and lifestyle factors, are more prevalent. This contrasts with developing countries where infectious diseases are more common. So G might be the correct answer.

Option H: Dominance of the subsistence economy. Subsistence economies are where people produce just enough to meet their basic needs, typical of less developed areas. Developed countries have market-based economies with a focus on industry and services. So H is not correct.

Option I: Limited access to clean water and sanitation. Developed countries usually have good infrastructure, providing clean water and sanitation to most of their population. Lack of access is more of a problem in developing countries. So I is incorrect.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be G because it aligns with the characteristics of a developed country where lifestyle and age-related diseases are more common due to higher life expectancy and different lifestyles compared to less developed nations.

The correct answer is G. In developed countries, the main diseases are often related to age and lifestyle, such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancers, due to higher life expectancy and lifestyle factors.

G
