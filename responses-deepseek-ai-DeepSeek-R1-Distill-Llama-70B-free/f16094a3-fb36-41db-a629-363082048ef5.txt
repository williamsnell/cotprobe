Okay, so I've got this problem here about a record that sells for $3.24, and there's a 35% markup based on the selling price. I need to find the cost of the record. Hmm, markups can be a bit tricky, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that markup can be based on cost or selling price. In this case, it's based on the selling price, so the markup is calculated as a percentage of the selling price, not the cost. I've heard that sometimes people get confused between markup and margin, so I need to be careful here.

So the formula when markup is based on selling price is: Selling Price = Cost + (Markup Percentage * Selling Price). Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. If the markup is 35% of the selling price, then the cost would be the selling price minus that markup. Because the selling price includes the cost plus the markup.

Wait, another approach: the selling price is the cost plus the markup amount. Since the markup is 35% of the selling price, that means the selling price is 100% plus 35% markup, making it 135% of the cost. Or wait, no. Let me clarify.

Wait, no. If the markup is 35% of the selling price, then the cost is selling price minus 35% of selling price. Because the markup is added to the cost to get the selling price.

So mathematically, Cost = Selling Price - (Markup% * Selling Price). Let me write that as an equation.

Let me denote the selling price as SP, cost as C, and markup percentage as M.

So, M = 35% = 0.35. The formula would be: C = SP - (M * SP). Alternatively, C = SP * (1 - M).

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because if the markup is on the selling price, then the cost is SP minus the markup amount. The markup amount is M * SP, so yes, C = SP - (M * SP) = SP*(1-M).

Wait, but another way to think about it is that the markup is added to the cost to get the selling price. So if the markup is 35% of SP, then the selling price is cost plus 35% of SP. So SP = C + 0.35*SP. Solving for C, we get C = SP - 0.35*SP = 0.65*SP.

So in this case, SP is $3.24. So cost is 0.65 * 3.24.

Let me calculate that. 3.24 multiplied by 0.65.

Hmm, 3 * 0.65 is 1.95, and 0.24 * 0.65 is 0.156. Adding those together: 1.95 + 0.156 = 2.106. So approximately $2.106.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see exactly $2.11. Let me check the options again.

Options are: A:1.13, B:3.59, C:2.70, D:2.00, E:2.40, F:2.90, G:3.00, H:4.37, I:2.11, J:1.89.

Oh, option I is $2.11. So that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculation. 3.24 * 0.65.

Alternatively, breaking it down: 3.24 * 0.6 is 1.944, and 3.24 *0.05 is 0.162. Adding them gives 1.944 + 0.162 = 2.106. Yes, so $2.106, which is $2.11 when rounded to the nearest cent.

So the cost should be $2.11, which is option I.

To determine the cost of the record, we know the selling price (SP) is $3.24 and the markup is 35% of the selling price. Since the markup is based on the selling price, the cost (C) can be calculated as:

\[
C = SP - (Markup \times SP)
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
C = 3.24 - (0.35 \times 3.24)
\]

First, calculate the markup amount:

\[
0.35 \times 3.24 = 1.134
\]

Now, subtract the markup from the selling price:

\[
C = 3.24 - 1.134 = 2.106
\]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the cost is approximately $2.11. Comparing this to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**I: $2.11**
