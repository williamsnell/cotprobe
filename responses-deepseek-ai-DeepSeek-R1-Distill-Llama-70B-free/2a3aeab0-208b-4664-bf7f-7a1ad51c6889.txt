Okay, so I have this optics question here about eyes and spectacle lenses. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question has two parts. The first part is about the near point of an eye that's prescribed a +2 diopter lens. The second part is about the far point of an eye with a -0.5 diopter lens. I need to figure out both and match the options given.

Let me start by recalling some basic concepts. I remember that the power of a lens is the reciprocal of its focal length, measured in meters. So Power (D) = 1/f, where f is in meters.

For the near point: When a person's near point is at a certain distance, they can't focus on objects closer than that. I think spectacle lenses are used to correct this. A converging lens (+ power) is used for hyperopia (farsightedness), which means the eye can't focus on near objects. The lens helps to converge the light so that the eye can focus on closer objects.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the near point is the closest point where the eye can focus without any lens. If a person's near point is too far away (say, 50 cm instead of the normal 25 cm), they would need a corrective lens. The lens's power would be determined based on that distance.

The formula for the near point correction is 1/f = 1/near_point, but wait, I think I might have that mixed up. Oh right, the focal length of the spectacle lens is such that when the object is at the near point, the image is formed at the eye's far point. Wait, no, wait. Maybe I should think in terms of the lens formula.

Alternatively, for the near point, the lens is used to take objects at the near point and make them appear at the eye's far point. So the lens's power is determined by the distance of the near point. The formula I think is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di, but I might be mixing that up. Alternatively, for the near correction, the focal length of the lens is equal to the near point distance. Oh wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think that for the near point, the lens's power is calculated as the reciprocal of the near point distance in meters. Because the lens should be able to focus light from that near point. So, if a lens has a power of +2 diopters, then the focal length f is 1/2 meters, which is 0.5 meters or 50 cm. So the near point would be at 50 cm. Because when the object is at the near point, the lens forms an image that the eye can see. So the near point is 50 cm.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. The near point is the closest point the eye can focus without accommodation. For a myopic eye, the near point is farther away, but that requires a different lens. Wait, the question is about the near point for a +2 diopter lens. No, the question is about the near point when a +2 diopter lens is prescribed.

Wait, no. The first part is: where is the near point of an eye that's prescribed a +2 diopter lens. So the lens is correcting the near point.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the lens formula. When an object is placed at the near point, the lens creates an image at the far point. The power of the lens is determined by the near point distance.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the formula. The formula for the power of the corrective lens is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di. But in the case of the near point, the object is at the near point (do), and the image has to be formed at the far point of the eye (di). But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, the lens is used to take the image from the near point to infinity, but that doesn't sound right either.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the near point distance as being related to the focal length of the lens. For the near point, the object is at the near point, and the lens is used so that the image is at infinity. Or wait, no, that can't be right because the lens would have a certain power to focus it. Let me think again.

Wait, the near point is the closest point the eye can focus without strain. So when the object is at the near point, the eye's maximum accommodation brings the image into focus. So the corrective lens is used to make sure that when the object is at the near point, the image is formed at a point where the eye can focus it. So perhaps the lens's focal length is set so that when the object is at the near point, the image is at the eye's far point.

Wait, maybe the formula is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di, where do is the near point (the object distance from the lens) and di is the far point (the image distance from the lens). But I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, I think the correct approach is that the power of the lens is the reciprocal of the near point distance. So for a +2 diopter lens, the near point is 1/2 meters, which is 50 cm. So the near point would be 50 cm. That would match option F, D, or others.

Wait, let me see. Power is in diopters, which is 1/m, so 2 diopters is 1/(0.5 m) → 0.5 m =50 cm. So the near point is 50 cm.

Now the second part: the far point of an eye with a -0.5 diopter lens. So a negative lens is for myopia (nearsightedness), where the eye can't focus on distant objects. The far point is the farthest point the eye can see clearly without the lens. So the lens corrects this by diverging the light so that distant objects are focused on the retina.

The formula for the far point would be the reciprocal of the lens power. So for a -0.5 diopter lens, the focal length is 1/(-0.5) = -2 meters, which is -200 cm.

Wait, but wait. The far point is the distance beyond which the eye cannot focus. So when you wear the corrective lens, the lens takes light from objects at infinity (far point) and forms an image at the far point of the uncorrected eye.

Wait, I think the formula is that the far point is at the focal length of the lens. So for a -0.5 diopter lens, f = -2 meters → -200 cm. So the far point is at -200 cm. But looking at the options, let me see which option has 50 cm near point and -200 cm far point.

Looking at the options:

Option F: 50 cm, -200 cm. So that's the one.

Wait, but let me cross-verify. For the near point calculation, if the lens is +2 diopters, then the near point is 50 cm. For the far point, the lens is -0.5 diopters, so the far point is at -2 meters → -200 cm. So yes, that's option F.

So the answer should be F.

To determine the correct answer, we analyze the two parts of the question:

1. **Near Point of an Eye with a +2 Diopter Lens**:  
   The power of a lens is the reciprocal of its focal length in meters. For a lens with a power of +2 diopters, the focal length is:  
   \[
   f = \frac{1}{\text{Power}} = \frac{1}{2} \, \text{meters} = 0.5 \, \text{meters} = 50 \, \text{cm}.
   \]  
   This means the near point of the eye is at **50 cm**, as the lens is used to focus objects at this distance.

2. **Far Point of an Eye with a -0.5 Diopter Lens**:  
   For a lens with a power of -0.5 diopters, the focal length is:  
   \[
   f = \frac{1}{\text{Power}} = \frac{1}{-0.5} \, \text{meters} = -2 \, \text{meters} = -200 \, \text{cm}.
   \]  
   This means the far point of the eye is at **-200 cm**, as the lens is used to focus distant objects at this virtual point.

Matching these values to the options provided, the correct answer is **Option F: 50 cm, -200 cm**.

Answer: F
