Okay, so I'm trying to solve this TV signal problem. The question is about finding the carrier swing and the frequency deviation, Δf, given that the percentage modulation of the audio portion is 80%. Hmm, I remember that in TV systems, audio is usually modulated using frequency modulation (FM), right? But wait, the question is about the carrier swing and frequency deviation, which makes me think it's related to how much the carrier frequency changes.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. So, I think carrier swing refers to the total deviation in the carrier frequency, which is twice the maximum frequency deviation. Because when the audio is modulated, the carrier frequency shifts above and below the center frequency. So maximum deviation is one side, and swing is the total change from peak to peak.

But wait, the percentage modulation is given as 80%. Oh right! In AM (Amplitude Modulation), the percentage modulation is the ratio of the modulated amplitude to the unmodulated carrier. But in FM, modulation is about frequency deviation. So maybe I'm mixing things up here.

Wait, the question is about a TV signal. TV audio is typically transmitted using FM. So the audio (sound) is FM modulated onto the carrier. The percentage modulation here... wait, in FM, the modulation index is the ratio of the frequency deviation to the audio frequency. But percentage modulation is different. Or is it referring to the modulation index as a percentage?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. Oh wait, in AM, the percentage modulation is (modulation index) x 100%. So 80% modulation in AM means the modulation index μ is 0.8. But in FM, the modulation index is β = Δf / fa, where Δf is the frequency deviation and fa is the audio frequency. But wait, the question is about the audio portion, so perhaps the audio is AM modulated? Wait no, in TV systems, the audio is FM modulated.

Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up. Let me clarify. In TV systems, the video is AM modulated, and the audio is FM modulated. So the question is about the audio portion, which is FM. So the percentage modulation here probably refers to the modulation index for FM. But wait, I'm not sure if percentage modulation applies the same way in FM as it does in AM.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the carrier swing. I remember that in FM, the total carrier swing is twice the maximum frequency deviation. So if the maximum deviation is Δf, then the swing is 2Δf.

Wait, but what's the relation between percentage modulation and frequency deviation? Oh, perhaps in this context, the percentage modulation is the modulation index expressed as a percentage. So if it's 80%, then the frequency deviation is 80% of something. But what's the relation?

Wait, I think I'm confusing AM and FM terms here. Let me try to find a way out. Let's approach it step by step.

1. The question is about the audio portion of a TV signal. TV audio uses FM, so this is an FM problem.

2. The percentage modulation is 80%. I'm not entirely sure how this translates to FM terms. In AM, 80% modulation would mean the amplitude is varying by 80% of the carrier. But in FM, modulation is about frequency deviation. So perhaps the 80% refers to the ratio of Δf to some reference.

Wait, in FM, the modulation index β is given by β = Δf / fa, where fa is the audio frequency. But without knowing the audio frequency, perhaps that's not directly applicable here.

Alternatively, maybe the percentage modulation refers to the swing. For example, 100% modulation in FM would mean the frequency deviation is equal to the maximum allowed, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach. I think for TV audio, the maximum frequency deviation is typically 25 kHz on each side of the carrier. Or maybe it's 50 kHz total swing. Wait, but if the maximum deviation is 25 kHz, then the total swing (from max to min) would be 50 kHz. Or is that for the video carrier?

Wait, no. Let's think about TV standards. In the NTSC system, for example, the audio is FM modulated with a peak deviation of 25 kHz. So if the modulation is 80% of that, then Δf would be 0.8 * 25 kHz = 20 kHz. Then the carrier swing would be 2 * Δf, so 40 kHz.

So if the maximum possible deviation is 25 kHz, 80% of that is 20 kHz. So the frequency deviation Δf is 20 kHz, and the carrier swing is 40 kHz (20 each side).

Looking at the options, option A is 20 kHz and 40 kHz. So that would fit. But wait, let me make sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the percentage modulation refers to the ratio of the actual frequency deviation to the maximum possible, which is 25 kHz. So 80% would be 20 kHz for Δf, and swing is 40 kHz.

So the answer would be A: 20 kHz, 40 kHz.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 20 kHz, 40 kHz. That fits.

Another thought: I might have mixed up which is which. Let me think. The carrier swing is the total change in frequency, so from (fc - Δf) to (fc + Δf), the swing is 2Δf. So if the percentage modulation is 80%, then Δf is 80% of max, which is 25 kHz, so 20 kHz, swing is 40 kHz. Yes, that makes sense.

So the correct answer is A.

To solve the problem, we analyze the given scenario involving the audio portion of a TV signal, which uses Frequency Modulation (FM). The percentage modulation of 80% is provided, and we need to determine the carrier swing and frequency deviation, Δf.

1. **Understanding Key Concepts**:
   - In FM, the carrier frequency deviates in response to the modulating signal (audio). The frequency deviation, Δf, is the maximum shift in the carrier frequency.
   - The carrier swing is the total deviation, which is twice the maximum frequency deviation (2Δf).

2. **Relating Percentage Modulation to Frequency Deviation**:
   - Percentage modulation in this context likely refers to the modulation index, expressed as a percentage. For FM, a 100% modulation corresponds to the maximum allowable frequency deviation.
   - In TV systems, the maximum frequency deviation for audio is typically 25 kHz. Therefore, 80% modulation corresponds to 80% of this maximum deviation:  
     \[
     \Delta f = 0.8 \times 25 \, \text{kHz} = 20 \, \text{kHz}.
     \]

3. **Calculating Carrier Swing**:
   - The carrier swing is the total frequency deviation, which is twice the maximum frequency deviation:  
     \[
     \text{Carrier Swing} = 2 \times \Delta f = 2 \times 20 \, \text{kHz} = 40 \, \text{kHz}.
     \]

4. **Matching with Options**:
   - From the calculations, the frequency deviation is 20 kHz, and the carrier swing is 40 kHz. This matches option A.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**A: 20 kHz, 40 kHz.**
