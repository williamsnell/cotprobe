Question:

A previously healthy 14-year-old girl is brought to the physician because of a 2-day history of fever and pain and swelling of the right knee. She remembers injuring the knee while playing soccer last week, but she was able to finish the game. She has no history of rash or joint pain. Her sister has inflammatory bowel disease. The patient's temperature is 39째C (102.2째F), blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 20/min. Examination of the right knee shows swelling, tenderness, warmth, and erythema; range of motion is limited. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:

A: MRI of the right knee
B: X-ray of the right knee
C: Surgical intervention
D: Physiotherapy
E: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy
F: Nuclear scan of the right knee
G: Antibiotic therapy
H: Corticosteroid injection
I: Application of a knee brace
J: Arthrocentesis

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best next step for this patient. Let's see, she's a 14-year-old girl with a fever and right knee pain and swelling for two days. She had a recent injury playing soccer but finished the game. No history of rash or joint pain, but her sister has inflammatory bowel disease. 

Her vitals are temp 39째C, which is pretty high, BP normal, pulse a bit elevated, and respirations normal. On exam, the knee is swollen, tender, warm, erythematous, and limited range of motion. 

So, the main concerns here are the acute presentation with fever and joint inflammation. Since she had a trauma (the soccer injury) but continued playing, I'm thinking maybe it's either a traumatic injury or an infection. The high fever makes me lean towards an infectious cause, like septic arthritis. 

Septic arthritis is an emergency because the joint can be quickly damaged. So, the priority is to confirm the diagnosis. How do we do that? Arthrocentesis, which is joint aspiration, allows us to get synovial fluid for analysis. They can check the white blood cell count, culture for bacteria, and maybe crystals if they suspect gout, though that's rare in a 14-year-old. 

Other options: X-ray might show fractures or other bone issues, but if there's no suspicion of fracture beyond a possible trauma, it might not be the first step. MRI is detailed but usually for chronic issues or when X-rays are inconclusive. 

NSAIDs or corticosteroids would be bad in septic arthritis because they can worsen the condition. Surgical intervention might be needed if arthrocentesis confirms infection and irrigation is needed, but that's not the first step. 

Nuclear scan is more for osteomyelitis or stress fractures perhaps. Physiotherapy and knee braces are for recovery, not initial management. 

So the most appropriate next step is arthrocentesis to get the fluid and check for infection. That's option J.

The patient is a 14-year-old girl presenting with fever, knee pain, swelling, and limited range of motion following a soccer injury. Her high fever (39째C) and signs of inflammation (swelling, tenderness, warmth, erythema) suggest a potential infectious cause, such as septic arthritis. Septic arthritis is a medical emergency requiring prompt diagnosis and treatment to prevent joint damage.

The most appropriate next step is arthrocentesis (joint aspiration) to obtain synovial fluid for analysis. This procedure allows for the determination of white blood cell count, bacterial culture, and other tests to confirm or rule out infection. Other imaging or therapeutic options, such as X-ray, MRI, or antibiotic therapy, may follow based on the results of the arthrocentesis.

Answer: J
