Question:

A patient comes into the hospital after being bit by a dog who he stated was “acting crazy”. The wound is open and bleeding. Animal control captured the dog and said that it was foaming at the mouth and extremely aggressive. Suspecting a rabies infection, the patient is given a serum that contains rabies antibodies that were grown inside a horse. This is an example of what kind of immunity?

Options:

A: Passive
B: Acquired
C: Passive natural
D: Natural
E: Active artificial
F: Passive artificial
G: Active natural
H: Artificial
I: Innate
J: Active

Alright, let me try to work through this question. Okay, so the scenario is a patient who was bitten by a dog that was acting crazy. The dog was foaming at the mouth and aggressive, which makes me think of rabies. The patient's wound is open and bleeding, so they're probably at high risk of infection.

The key point here is the treatment given. The patient received a serum containing rabies antibodies that were grown inside a horse. I remember that antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system to fight specific antigens. So, in this case, the antibodies are from a horse, which means they're not the patient's own.

Now, the question is about what kind of immunity this represents. I've studied that there are two main types of immunity: active and passive. Active immunity is when the body produces its own antibodies, either through infection or vaccination. This provides long-term protection because the immune system remembers the pathogen. On the other hand, passive immunity involves receiving pre-made antibodies from an external source, which gives immediate but temporary protection since the body doesn't produce the antibodies itself.

Looking at the options, the patient received antibodies directly. That means it's passive immunity. Now, is it natural or artificial? Natural passive immunity usually comes from mother to child, like through breast milk or the placenta. Artificial would be when it's administered through treatments, like in this case with the serum from a horse. So this must be passive artificial immunity.

Wait, let me double-check. The serum is an external source, not produced by the patient, so it's passive. And it's given as a treatment, so it's artificial. That should be option F: Passive artificial.

I think I got it right. So the answer is F.

The patient was bitten by a dog suspected of having rabies and was treated with a serum containing rabies antibodies produced in a horse. This treatment provides immediate protection by transferring pre-made antibodies, which is characteristic of passive immunity. Since the antibodies were administered externally as a medical intervention, it is classified as artificial. Therefore, the correct answer is passive artificial immunity.
