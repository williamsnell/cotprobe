Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the energy stored in a nonlinear capacitor. Hmm, I remember that capacitors store energy, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formulas, especially for nonlinear ones. Let me think.

The problem gives me g(t) = 0.5 ν²(t), and ν(t) is 1 + 0.5 sin t, for t from 0 to 1 second. Wait, wait. Oh right, g(t) is the charge as a function of time, right? So Q = g(t) = 0.5 ν²(t). That makes sense because for a nonlinear capacitor, the charge isn't just a simple C times V like in linear cases.

Energy stored in a capacitor is usually found by integrating the product of voltage and the differential charge, right? The formula I remember is W = ∫ V dQ from 0 to Q_max. But since we're dealing with time here, maybe I should express it in terms of time.

So since Q = 0.5 ν², I can find dQ/dt. Let's compute that. The derivative of Q with respect to t is dQ/dt = 0.5 * 2ν * dν/dt = ν(t) * dν/dt.

Wait, but voltage is ν(t), so V(t) = 1 + 0.5 sin t. And dQ is (dQ/dt) dt, which is ν(t) dν/dt dt. Hmm, putting this together, the energy W is the integral from t=0 to t=1 of V(t) dQ. So substituting, it's ∫ V(t) * ν(t) dν/dt dt from 0 to 1.

Wait, but dν/dt is the derivative of ν with respect to t. Let me compute that. ν(t) is 1 + 0.5 sin t, so dν/dt = 0.5 cos t. So putting it all together:

W = ∫ (from t=0 to t=1) [1 + 0.5 sin t] * [1 + 0.5 sin t] * (0.5 cos t) dt.

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-express. V(t) is 1 + 0.5 sin t, and dQ is ν(t) dν/dt dt. So the integral becomes ∫ [V(t)] * [ν(t) dν/dt] dt from 0 to 1. Wait, that's not right. Wait, no, V(t) is just the voltage, which is ν(t). So the energy is ∫ V(t) dQ(t). Since dQ(t) is dQ/dt dt, which is ν(t) dν/dt dt. So the integral becomes ∫ V(t) * (ν(t) dν/dt) dt. But wait, V(t) is ν(t), so that's ν(t) squared times dν/dt dt.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think of energy as the integral from 0 to Q of V dQ. But since Q is a function of ν, and ν is a function of time, maybe it's easier to express everything in terms of ν and integrate over ν.

Wait, let me clarify. The charge Q is 0.5 ν². So ν = sqrt(2 Q). But energy is ∫ V dQ from 0 to Q_total. So V is (1 + 0.5 sin t), but I'm not sure about expressing V in terms of Q. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express everything in terms of time t and integrate over t.

Alternatively, perhaps express the energy as the integral from t=0 to t=1 of power, where power is V(t) * I(t), and I(t) is dQ/dt.

Wait, I think that's a good approach. The power at any instant is V(t) multiplied by the current I(t), which is dQ/dt. So energy is the integral of power over time, which in this case is ∫ (V(t) * I(t)) dt from 0 to 1.

But I(t) is dQ/dt. And since Q(t) = 0.5 ν²(t), dQ/dt = ν(t) * dν/dt. So I(t) = ν(t) * dν/dt.

So putting it all together, the energy W is ∫ (V(t) * I(t)) dt from 0 to 1. Substituting, that's ∫ [ν(t) * (ν(t) dν/dt)] dt, which is ∫ ν(t)^2 * dν/dt dt.

Wait, but ν(t) is given as 1 + 0.5 sin t. So dν/dt is 0.5 cos t. So substituting, we have:

W = ∫ (from t=0 to t=1) [ (1 + 0.5 sin t )^2 ] * (0.5 cos t) dt.

Wait, but perhaps I can make a substitution here. Let me set u = 1 + 0.5 sin t. Then du/dt = 0.5 cos t, so du = 0.5 cos t dt. That means that the integral becomes ∫ u^2 du, but I need to adjust the limits.

Wait, when t=0, u = 1 + 0.5 sin(0) = 1. When t=1, u = 1 + 0.5 sin(1). So the integral becomes ∫ (from u=1 to u=1 + 0.5 sin(1)) u^2 du.

Computing that integral, the antiderivative of u^2 is (u^3)/3. So evaluating from 1 to 1 + 0.5 sin(1):

W = [ ( (1 + 0.5 sin(1))^3 ) /3 ] - [ (1^3)/3 ].

So W = [ (1 + 0.5 sin(1))^3 - 1 ] / 3.

Now I need to compute this value numerically.

First, calculate sin(1). Since 1 radian is approximately 57.3 degrees, sin(1) is about 0.84147.

So 0.5 * sin(1) ≈ 0.420735.

Adding 1 gives 1.420735.

Then (1.420735)^3 is approximately let's compute that step by step.

1.42^3 = ?

1.42 * 1.42 = 2.0164. Then 2.0164 * 1.42 ≈ 2.863 (exact value? Let me compute more accurately.)

Wait, 1.420735^3:

Compute 1.420735 * 1.420735:

1.420735 * 1.420735 ≈ 2.0203 (since 1.42^2 is 2.0164, so a bit higher).

Then multiply by 1.420735 again:

2.0203 * 1.420735 ≈ let's compute 2 * 1.420735 = 2.84147, and 0.0203 * 1.420735 ≈ 0.0288. So total is approximately 2.84147 + 0.0288 = 2.87027.

So (1.420735)^3 ≈ 2.87027.

So W = (2.87027 - 1) /3 = (1.87027)/3 ≈ 0.62342 J.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.623 J. So the answer should be D.

To find the energy stored in the nonlinear capacitor, we start with the given charge-voltage relationship \( Q(t) = 0.5 \nu^2(t) \) and the voltage as a function of time \( \nu(t) = 1 + 0.5 \sin t \). The energy stored in a capacitor is given by:

\[
W = \int_0^{Q_{\text{max}}} V \, dQ
\]

Since \( Q(t) \) is expressed in terms of \( \nu(t) \), and \( \nu(t) \) is a function of time, it is convenient to express the energy in terms of time \( t \). Substituting \( Q(t) = 0.5 \nu^2(t) \), we compute \( dQ/dt = \nu(t) \cdot d\nu/dt \). The energy becomes:

\[
W = \int_0^1 V(t) \cdot \frac{dQ}{dt} \, dt = \int_0^1 \nu(t) \cdot \nu(t) \cdot \frac{d\nu}{dt} \, dt = \int_0^1 \nu^2(t) \cdot \frac{d\nu}{dt} \, dt
\]

Substituting \( \nu(t) = 1 + 0.5 \sin t \), we have \( \frac{d\nu}{dt} = 0.5 \cos t \). Thus, the integral becomes:

\[
W = \int_0^1 \left( 1 + 0.5 \sin t \right)^2 \cdot 0.5 \cos t \, dt
\]

To simplify, use the substitution \( u = 1 + 0.5 \sin t \), so \( du = 0.5 \cos t \, dt \). The limits of integration change as follows:
- When \( t = 0 \), \( u = 1 + 0.5 \sin(0) = 1 \),
- When \( t = 1 \), \( u = 1 + 0.5 \sin(1) \).

The integral becomes:

\[
W = \int_1^{1 + 0.5 \sin(1)} u^2 \, du
\]

The antiderivative of \( u^2 \) is \( \frac{u^3}{3} \). Evaluating this at the limits:

\[
W = \frac{\left( 1 + 0.5 \sin(1) \right)^3}{3} - \frac{1^3}{3}
\]

First, compute \( \sin(1) \approx 0.84147 \), so \( 0.5 \sin(1) \approx 0.420735 \). Adding 1 gives \( 1 + 0.420735 = 1.420735 \). Now, \( \left( 1.420735 \right)^3 \approx 2.87027 \). Substituting:

\[
W = \frac{2.87027 - 1}{3} = \frac{1.87027}{3} \approx 0.62342 \, \text{J}
\]

Comparing this result to the options, the closest match is **D: 0.623 J**.
