Question:

 To evaluate an organization's Strategic Business Units (SBU), the Boston Consulting Group developed a portfolio performance framework that characterizes some of the SBUs as:

Options:

A: Cash outs.
B: Silver bullets.
C: Question marks.
D: Risky ventures.
E: Charging bulls.
F: Quick winners.
G: Steady performers.
H: Golden geese.
I: Slow starters.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the Boston Consulting Group's portfolio performance framework for evaluating Strategic Business Units (SBUs). I remember that BCG came up with a matrix to categorize business units based on market growth and relative market share. The question is asking which of the options correctly identifies some of the SBUs as per this framework.

The options are A through I. Let me think about each option and see which ones fit.

I think the BCG matrix has four main categories. The first one is Stars, which are high growth and high market share. Then there's Cash Cows, which are low growth but high market share. The third category is Question Marks, which are high growth but low market share. And the last one is Dogs, which are low in both.

Looking at the options given:

Option C is Question marks. That definitely fits because that's one of the categories. So that's a correct term.

Option H is Golden geese. Hmm, I think that might be another term used for Stars. Wait, no, the actual term is Stars. I'm not sure about Golden geese. Maybe it's another way to refer to them, but I'm not certain.

Option G is Steady performers. That sounds like Cash Cows because they provide steady income. So G might be correct.

Wait, but the question says "characterizes some of the SBUs as" and the options are each individual terms. So the correct answers would be the ones that match the BCG categories.

So, from the options, I can spot Question Marks (C) as correct. Now, checking the others:

Option A: Cash outs. That doesn't ring a bell. Cash Cows are one category, but Cash outs isn't a term I remember.

Option B: Silver bullets. Not sure, maybe not part of the standard BCG terms.

Option D: Risky ventures. That sounds more like a general term, not specific to BCG's framework.

Option E: Charging bulls. Doesn't seem familiar.

Option F: Quick winners. Not part of the standard categories. Maybe a made-up term.

Option I: Slow starters. Again, not matching the standard terms.

So, among the options, the correct ones would be C (Question Marks) and possibly another term. Wait, the question is phrased as "characterizes some of the SBUs as:", which probably means more than one correct option. But looking at the options, the ones that match are C and G? Because G is Steady performers, which could be Cash Cows.

Wait, but the options are single-answer, so the question is probably asking which of the options is a correct term used by BCG. So the correct answers would be C and G. But the options are given as A-J, each being a single choice. Wait, no, the question is asking which of the options correctly identifies some of the SBUs. So the correct options would be C, G, and maybe others if they match.

Wait, the options given are each individual terms. So the correct answers among the options are C (Question marks), G (Steady performers, i.e., Cash Cows), and H (Golden geese, which I'm not sure about). Alternatively, perhaps the BCG matrix uses different terms.

Wait, another thought: I've heard the terms Stars, Cash Cows, Question Marks, and Dogs. So in the options, C is Question Marks, which is correct. Are there any others? Let me see the options again.

Option G is Steady performers. That could be Cash Cows. So G would be correct as well.

Wait, but the question is a multiple-choice question with options A-J, each being a single term. So the correct answers would be the ones that match the BCG categories. So in the provided options, C (Question Marks) and G (Steady performers) are correct.

But looking back, the options are single choices, so perhaps the question is looking for all correct terms among the options. Wait, no, the question says "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen," implying it's a single correct answer. So perhaps the question is asking which of the options is a correct term.

So if the options are each possible terms, the correct ones would be C and G. But since it's a single-choice question, perhaps the answer expects multiple correct options, but in the given format, I have to pick one.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking which of the options is a correct term, not all. So looking at the options, C is definitely correct as Question Marks.

I think the correct answer is C and G, but since it's a single-choice, perhaps the intended answer is C. Alternatively, the question may have more than one correct option, but in the setup, each option is a single choice.

Wait, perhaps the options are each individual terms, and the question is which ones are correct. But the way the question is phrased, it's asking which of the options correctly identifies some of the SBUs. So the correct terms would be C, G, and possibly others. But looking at the options, only C and G seem to match.

Wait, the initial BCG matrix terms are Stars, Cash Cows, Question Marks, and Dogs. So the correct terms would be:

- Stars
- Cash Cows
- Question Marks
- Dogs

Looking at the options:

C: Question Marks → correct.

G: Steady performers → probably Cash Cows.

So, the correct options are C and G.

But the question asks which of the options (each being a single term) is correct. So perhaps the answer is C and G. But in the multiple-choice setup provided (options A-J each being single terms), the correct answers would be C and G.

Wait, but the user instruction says to reply directly with the chosen letter. So perhaps the question expects multiple correct answers, but in the format, you can only choose one. Alternatively, perhaps the question is only testing one correct term.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C, G, and H. Wait, H is Golden geese. I'm not sure about that term. I think the correct terms are Stars, Cash Cows, Question Marks, and Dogs. So Golden geese isn't a standard term. So H is incorrect.

So, from the options, the correct terms are C (Question Marks) and G (Steady performers, which is Cash Cows).

But the question gives options A-J, and we have to choose which are correct. Since it's a single-answer question, perhaps the intended correct answer is C and G, but I can only select one. Hmm, perhaps the question is testing for all the correct terms, but in the given options, only C and G are correct.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, it's asking which of the options (each being a single term) are correct. So perhaps the correct answers are C and G, but as it's a single-choice, maybe the question expects the selection of all correct terms. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is likely testing for the four categories, and among the options, C (Question Marks) is one of them. So the correct answer is C.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the options include G as Steady performers, which I think is Cash Cows. So perhaps the correct answers are both C and G. But the question is structured as a single-choice, so I'm a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C and G, but since the options are single letters, perhaps the answer expects multiple letters, but in the given setup, I can only choose one. Hmm.

Wait, looking back, the question says "characterizes some of the SBUs as:", so perhaps more than one option is correct. But the way the question is presented, each option is a single term, so the correct answer would include all the correct terms among the options. But since it's a multiple-choice with single answers, perhaps the intended correct answers are C and G.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: I'll try to recall the BCG matrix terms.

1. Stars: High market share, high growth.
2. Cash Cows: High market share, low growth.
3. Question Marks: Low market share, high growth.
4. Dogs: Low market share, low growth.

So the terms are Stars, Cash Cows, Question Marks, Dogs.

Looking at the options:

C: Question Marks → correct.

G: Steady performers → likely Cash Cows, correct.

So both C and G are correct. But the question expects a single answer, so perhaps the intended answer is C and G. But the options are separate, so maybe the question is looking for all correct terms, but the user can only select one letter.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking which option is correct, meaning any one of them. So the correct answers would be C and G, but if I have to choose, perhaps the intended answer is C.

Wait, but the options are A to J, each being a single term, and the question is which of the options correctly identifies some of the SBUs. So the correct options are C and G, but perhaps the question expects both. However, since the user instruction says to reply with a single letter, I think the intended answer is C and G, but I'm to pick all correct letters. But the setup doesn't allow that. So perhaps the question is only testing for Question Marks, which is option C.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the answer elsewhere. I recall that the BCG matrix uses the terms Stars, Cash Cows, Question Marks, and Dogs. So in the options, C is Question Marks, and G is Steady performers (which is Cash Cows). So both are correct.

But the question is phrased as a multiple-choice with single answers. So perhaps the correct answer includes both C and G, but since I can't select both, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the correct answer is option C and G, but in the given format, I have to pick one. But the user instruction says to reply with the letter, so perhaps the intended answer is C and G, but since I can't, perhaps the question expects both to be correct, but I can only choose one.

Wait, perhaps the answer is both C and G, but the options are single letters. So perhaps the correct answer is C and G, but the question expects multiple selections. But in the setup, it's a single choice.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only testing for Question Marks, so the answer is C.

I think I'll go with option C as the correct answer because it's definitely one of the categories, and perhaps the question expects that. Alternatively, if both C and G are correct, but I can only select one, I'm a bit torn. But since the question asks which of the options is correct, and both C and G are correct, but I can only choose one, perhaps the intended answer is C.

Wait, perhaps the answer is C, G, and another. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the terms. The BCG matrix's four categories are Stars, Cash Cows, Question Marks, and Dogs. So the correct terms among the options are C (Question Marks) and G (Steady performers, which is Cash Cows).

So both C and G are correct. But in the given options, each is a separate choice, so perhaps the correct answer includes both C and G. However, since the user can only select one letter, perhaps the question expects the selection of all correct options, but in the given setup, it's not possible. Therefore, I think the intended answer is C and G, but since I can't select both, I'll choose C as the answer.

The Boston Consulting Group's portfolio performance framework categorizes Strategic Business Units (SBUs) into four main categories based on market growth and relative market share: Stars, Cash Cows, Question Marks, and Dogs. Among the provided options:

- **Option C: Question Marks** corresponds to SBUs with high market growth but low relative market share, making it a correct term.  
- **Option G: Steady performers** aligns with Cash Cows, which are SBUs with low market growth but high relative market share, also making it correct.  

While both C and G are correct based on the BCG framework, the question appears to be structured as a single-choice question. Therefore, the most definitive and unambiguous correct answer is **C: Question Marks**.

Answer: C
