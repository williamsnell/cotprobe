Okay, so I've got this problem here about Handy Dandy Speakers selling to Tech High-Fi. The question is about finding the net price Tech High-Fi is paying after a trade discount. Alright, let's break this down.

The speaker is sold for $299.50 each, and there's a trade discount of 36%. I remember that a trade discount reduces the price, so the net price is the original price minus the discount amount. But wait, how exactly do I calculate that?

So, the formula I think is: Net Price = Original Price * (1 - Discount Rate). Or maybe it's Original Price minus (Original Price multiplied by the discount rate). Both should give the same result. Let me write that down. The discount is 36%, which is 0.36 in decimal form.

So, the discount amount would be 299.50 * 0.36. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 299.50 times 0.36. Let me do this step by step. 300 * 0.36 is easy, that's 108. But wait, it's 299.50, so 0.50 less than 300. So, 0.36 * 0.50 is 0.18. So, 108 minus 0.18 is 107.82. So the discount is $107.82.

Now, subtract that discount from the original price to get the net price. So, 299.50 minus 107.82. Let me calculate that. 299.50 minus 100 is 199.50. Then subtract 7.82 more. 199.50 minus 7 is 192.50, and then minus 0.82 gives 191.68. Wait, but let me double-check that subtraction because I sometimes make errors there.

Wait another way: 299.50 - 107.82. Let me line it up:

299.50
-107.82
--------
Starting from the right:
0-2, can't do, borrow. So 10-2=8, but the next digit is 5 (after borrowing), so 5 becomes 4. Then 4-8? Hmm, wait, maybe I should do it another way. Maybe 299.50 is the same as 299.5, and 107.82 is the same. Let me subtract 107.82 from 299.50.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the discount calculation. Let me check that again. 299.50 * 0.36. Let me calculate it properly.

Another approach: 299.50 * 0.36.

Break it down: 300 * 0.36 = 108. But since it's 299.50, which is 0.5 less than 300, I need to subtract 0.5 * 0.36, which is 0.18. So 108 - 0.18 = 107.82. That part seems correct.

So subtracting 107.82 from 299.50 gives 191.68. Looking at the options, option E is $191.68. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the subtraction.

Wait another way: 299.50 minus 100 is 199.50. Then subtract 7.82. 199.50 -7 is 192.50, then minus 0.82 is 191.68. That seems right.

So the net price should be $191.68, which is option E.

Wait, but some of the options are much higher, like option B is 215.64. Did I do the formula correctly? Because if the trade discount is 36%, then the net price is 64% of the original. Oh wait, that's another way to calculate it: 299.50 * (1 - 0.36) = 299.50 * 0.64.

Let me compute 299.50 * 0.64. Let me break it down: 300 * 0.64 is 192. So 299.50 is 0.50 less than 300. So 0.50 * 0.64 is 0.32. So 192 - 0.32 = 191.68. Yep, same result. So I think option E is correct.

But wait, looking at the options again, the options are A through J. Let me scan them:

A: $251.55

B: $215.64

C: $391.82

D: $299.50

E: $191.68

F: $383.64

G: $89.70

H: $107.82

I: $179.70

J: $239.60

So E is $191.68, which matches my calculation. So the answer should be E.

The problem involves calculating the net price Tech High-Fi pays for each speaker after applying a 36% trade discount on the original price of $299.50. The formula used is:

\[
\text{Net Price} = \text{Original Price} \times (1 - \text{Discount Rate})
\]

1. **Convert the discount percentage to a decimal**:  
   \[
   36\% = 0.36
   \]

2. **Calculate the discount amount**:  
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = 299.50 \times 0.36 = 107.82
   \]

3. **Subtract the discount from the original price**:  
   \[
   \text{Net Price} = 299.50 - 107.82 = 191.68
   \]

Thus, the net price Tech High-Fi pays for each set is **$191.68**, which corresponds to option **E**.

**Answer: E**
