Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about monatomic ions of representative elements and their common characteristics. Let me think about what I remember from my classes.

Monatomic ions are ions formed from single atoms, right? Like Na+ or Cl-. Representative elements are those in the s and p blocks of the periodic table, excluding the transition metals and the like. So these include elements like alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, halogens, and noble gases.

The question is asking what's a common property of their monatomic ions. The options are A to J. Let me go through each option.

Option A: very electronegative. Hmm. Well, electronegativity is a property of atoms, not ions. Plus, ions can have different behaviors. For example, Na+ is less electronegative than Na, but I'm not sure if this is the right path. Maybe not the best choice.

Option B: typically metallic. Wait, monatomic ions — metallic usually refers to the solid state. I know metals form cations, but the ions themselves aren't metallic in the traditional sense. So maybe B isn't the right answer.

Option C: highly colored. That sounds more like transition metal ions, which form colored compounds because of d-electrons. Representative elements' ions are usually colorless. For example, NaCl solution is colorless. So C is probably incorrect.

Option D: mostly gases at room temp. Well, elements like noble gases are gases, but their ions? I don't think ions are typically gaseous at room temp. They might be in compounds, but as ions, they’re usually in ionic solids or solutions. So D might not be right.

Option E: often very reactive with water. Let me think. Some ions react with water, like Na+ doesn't really react with water, but the metal Na does. Wait, but the question is about ions. For example, some ions like N3- might react, but I'm not sure if this is a common trait. Maybe some do, but not most? Not sure.

Option F: extremely large in size. Ions can vary in size. For example, anions are usually larger than their parent atoms. But whether they're extremely large... I'm not certain. Some are, like S^2- is bigger than S, but is that a general rule? Maybe not all monatomic ions are extremely large.

Option G: isoelectronic with a noble gas. Oh, right! Many monatomic ions have the same electron configuration as noble gases. Like Na+ has the same as Ne, and Cl- as Ar. The formation of ions often leads to a noble gas electron configuration because that's stable. So this seems like a strong candidate.

Option H: often found in liquid state. No, ions are usually in solids (like in ionic compounds) or in aqueous solutions, which are liquid, but the ions themselves are solvated, not liquid themselves. So H doesn't seem right.

Option I: usually very magnetic. Magnetic properties usually come from unpaired electrons. Noble gas-like ions have full electron shells, so no unpaired electrons. So their ions are typically diamagnetic, not magnetic. So I is probably incorrect.

Option J: very soluble. Solubility depends on the compound. For example, NaCl is soluble, but something like BaSO4 isn't. It's more about the specific compound than the ion itself. So J might not be the general case.

Putting it all together, the best fit seems to be G: isoelectronic with a noble gas. Because when elements form monatomic ions, they usually gain or lose electrons to reach the electron configuration of the nearest noble gas. So ions like Cl- (same as Ar), Mg^2+ (same as Ne), etc., are all examples of this.

Monatomic ions of representative elements are atoms that have gained or lost electrons to form ions with a single atomic structure. Representative elements belong to the s and p blocks of the periodic table, excluding transition metals. The question asks about a common property of these ions.

- **Option A**: Electronegativity is a property of atoms, not ions, so this is not relevant.  
- **Option B**: While metals form cations, the term "metallic" typically refers to the solid state of elements, not their ionized forms.  
- **Option C**: Highly colored ions are characteristic of transition metals due to d-electrons, not representative elements.  
- **Option D**: Ions are not typically gaseous at room temperature; they are usually found in ionic solids or solutions.  
- **Option E**: Reactivity with water varies, but it is not a universal property of monatomic ions.  
- **Option F**: While some ions are larger than their parent atoms, "extremely large" is not a general rule.  
- **Option G**: Many monatomic ions are isoelectronic with noble gases, as they gain or lose electrons to achieve a stable noble gas electron configuration (e.g., Na⁺ is isoelectronic with Ne, Cl⁻ with Ar). This is a common property.  
- **Option H**: Ions are not typically in a liquid state; they are usually in solids or solutions.  
- **Option I**: Noble gas-like ions have full electron shells, so they are not magnetic.  
- **Option J**: Solubility depends on the compound, not the ion itself, so this is not a general property.

The best answer is **G**, as monatomic ions of representative elements often achieve the same electron configuration as noble gases, making them isoelectronic.
