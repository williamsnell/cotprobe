Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the OLS estimator's properties—specifically about consistency, unbiasedness, and efficiency. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through step by step.

The question is asking which assumptions are required to show that the OLS estimator has these three properties: consistency, unbiasedness, and efficiency. The options given are combinations of four different assumptions (i to iv). 

Let me recall what each of these properties requires.

First, I remember that OLS estimators are unbiased if certain conditions are met. For unbiasedness, the key assumptions are that the errors have an expected value of zero (E(u_t)=0), that the errors are uncorrelated with each other (Cov(u_t, u_{t-j})=0 for all j), and that there's no perfect multicollinearity. Also, I think exogeneity is crucial here, but that's part of the same set of assumptions. So, I think that covers points i and iii. Wait, what about variance? Oh, right, for unbiasedness, the variance being constant (homoscedasticity, which is assumption ii) isn't strictly necessary. So maybe assumption ii isn't required for unbiasedness, but is for efficiency.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The Gauss-Markov theorem tells us that under certain conditions, OLS is the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE). The conditions for BLUE are: 

1. Linearity in parameters (the model is linear).
2. Strict exogeneity (E(u_t|X_t) = 0, which is a bit stronger than E(u_t)=0 perhaps).
3. No multicollinearity.
4. Homoscedasticity (Var(u_t)=σ²).
5. No serial correlation (Cov(u_t, u_{t-j})=0).

Wait, so for BLUE, we need assumptions i, ii, and iii. And the conclusion is that OLS is unbiased and efficient (BLUE). But wait, the question is about unbiasedness, consistency, and efficiency.

Wait, but hold on—what about consistency? Consistency is a property that refers to the estimator approaching the true parameter as the sample size increases. For consistency, I think we need certain conditions, like the regressors being sufficiently varied, but in terms of the error assumptions, perhaps stationarity and some form of independence.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to break it down.

Unbiasedness: OLS is unbiased if E(u_t)=0 and if the regressors are exogenous (which includes no autocorrelation, right? Or is that a separate condition?). Wait, no—exogeneity is E(u_t|X_t)=0, which implies that u_t is uncorrelated with X_t. But for unbiasedness, the key is that the expected error is zero and that the errors are uncorrelated with the regressors. So assumption i is crucial. But I'm not sure about the others.

Efficiency: This is about OLS having the lowest variance among all unbiased estimators. For this, I think we need the errors to be homoscedastic (assumption ii) and no serial correlation (assumption iii). So ii and iii are needed for efficiency.

Consistency: This requires that as the sample size increases, the estimator converges in probability to the true parameter. For consistency, I believe that the main requirements are that the model is correctly specified, including E(u_t)=0, and that the necessary laws of large numbers apply. Serial correlation (violation of iii) can affect consistency, but I think that under certain conditions, consistency can still hold even with some autocorrelation if it's not too severe. Wait, no—actually, in the presence of autocorrelation, the OLS estimator remains consistent as long as the other assumptions hold, but the standard errors may be incorrect. So for consistency, perhaps only E(u_t)=0 is needed. Hmm, wait no—consistency also requires that the regressors are not correlated with the errors. So perhaps exogeneity is needed, which again brings in other assumptions.

Wait, I'm getting myself mixed up. Let me try a different approach. Let me list out each property and which assumptions they require.

1. Unbiasedness:
   - OLS is unbiased if E(u_t) = 0 and if the errors are uncorrelated with the regressors (exogeneity). But in the standard setup, exogeneity is part of the model assumptions, which would include that the errors have mean zero and are uncorrelated with the regressors. So E(u_t) = 0 is definitely needed. But do we need the other assumptions for unbiasedness? I think not directly. So for unbiasedness, I think only i and perhaps iii (since exogeneity may require that u_t is uncorrelated with X_t, but perhaps iii refers to serial correlation, not correlation with X). Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things.

Wait, perhaps I should separate the assumptions. Assumption iii is about serial correlation; that is, the errors are uncorrelated with each other across time. Assumption i is about the mean being zero. Assumption ii is about homoscedasticity.

So for unbiasedness, the key is E(u_t)=0. So i is needed. Serial correlation (iii) being zero affects other properties, maybe efficiency, but not unbiasedness. So for unbiasedness, i is sufficient.

Wait, but if the errors are serially correlated, does that make OLS biased? No, I think OLS remains unbiased as long as the errors have zero mean and are uncorrelated with the regressors. So for unbiasedness, i is necessary, but iii is not required. Hmm, maybe I was wrong earlier.

Now, efficiency: For OLS to be the most efficient among unbiased estimators, we need the errors to be homoscedastic (ii) and no serial correlation (iii). So ii and iii are needed for efficiency.

Consistency: OLS is consistent under more general conditions. For consistency, I think the key is that the expected error is zero (i), and that certain regularity conditions are met (like the design matrix X having full rank and certain limits as n grows). It doesn't require homoscedasticity or no serial correlation. So for consistency, only i is needed. But wait, if the errors are serially correlated, does that affect consistency? I think no, because consistency is about convergence to the true parameter as n increases. So even with autocorrelated errors, the OLS estimator remains consistent as long as E(u_t)=0 and the model is correctly specified.

So putting this together:

- For unbiasedness: i is needed.

- For efficiency: ii and iii are needed.

- For consistency: i is needed, others not required.

Wait, but in the question, they're asking which assumptions are required to show all three properties—unbiasedness, consistency, and efficiency.

So, the OLS estimator is unbiased if i holds.

It's efficient if ii and iii hold.

It's consistent if i holds, but perhaps others as well, but I think for consistency, only i is needed.

Wait, but to have the estimator be BLUE (which is unbiased and efficient), we need i, ii, and iii. So maybe that's what the question is about.

Wait, the question is about three properties: unbiasedness, consistency, and efficiency.

Wait, I thought that OLS is unbiased under i and exogeneity, which includes more than just i, but perhaps the given options only include i, ii, iii, and iv.

Wait, another approach: the standard assumptions for OLS are often presented as:

1. Linearity in parameters.

2. Random sampling.

3. No perfect multicollinearity.

4. E(u_t) = 0 (unbiased errors).

5. Homoscedasticity (Var(u_t)=σ²).

6. No autocorrelation (Cov(u_t, u_{t-j})=0).

7. Normality of errors (u_t ~ N(0, σ²)) [optional for some properties].

Under these, OLS is unbiased (due to 4), efficient (due to 5 and 6), and consistent (due to 4 and others like random sampling). So the assumptions needed for all three properties would be i, ii, and iii. iv is needed for normality, which is required for the estimators to be normally distributed, but not for consistency, unbiasedness, or efficiency. So iv is not needed for those three properties.

So the assumptions required are i, ii, and iii. Looking at the options, option D is (i), (ii), and (iii) only.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. For unbiasedness, do we need ii and iii? No, I think only i is needed. For efficiency, we need ii and iii. For consistency, i is needed. So in total, to have all three properties (unbiased, efficient, consistent), we need i, ii, and iii.

So the correct answer would be option D.

To determine which assumptions are required to show the consistency, unbiasedness, and efficiency of the OLS estimator, we analyze the properties as follows:

1. **Unbiasedness**: The OLS estimator is unbiased if the expected value of the error term is zero, i.e., \( E(u_t) = 0 \). This corresponds to assumption (i). Assumptions (ii) and (iii) are not strictly necessary for unbiasedness.

2. **Efficiency**: For the OLS estimator to be efficient, it must have the lowest variance among all unbiased estimators. This requires the errors to be homoscedastic (\( \text{Var}(u_t) = \sigma^2 \)) and serially uncorrelated (\( \text{Cov}(u_t, u_{t-j}) = 0 \, \forall j \)). Thus, assumptions (ii) and (iii) are needed for efficiency.

3. **Consistency**: The OLS estimator is consistent if it converges in probability to the true parameter as the sample size increases. For consistency, the key requirement is that the expected error is zero (\( E(u_t) = 0 \)), which corresponds to assumption (i). Assumptions (ii) and (iii) are not necessary for consistency.

4. **Normality of Errors**: Assumption (iv) (\( u_t \sim N(0, \sigma^2) \)) is not required to show consistency, unbiasedness, or efficiency. It is only needed for the estimator to be normally distributed.

To summarize, the assumptions required to ensure the consistency, unbiasedness, and efficiency of the OLS estimator are (i), (ii), and (iii). Assumption (iv) is not necessary for these properties.

The correct answer is:

**D: (i), (ii), and (iii) only**
