Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the entropy change when an ideal gas expands under constant pressure. Hmm, I remember that entropy change, ΔS, is involved when there's heat transfer in a reversible process. Oh right, the formula for entropy is ΔS = Q_rev / T, where Q is the heat and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the process here is at constant pressure. Oh right, when pressure is constant, the work done is PΔV. So for an ideal gas, the internal energy change ΔU is nCvΔT, but since it's at constant pressure, maybe I should think in terms of enthalpy, H. Because H = U + PV, and at constant pressure, Q = ΔH.

Wait, let me think again. For an ideal gas, the entropy change can be calculated using ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1) + nCv ln(T2/T1), but that's when both temperature and volume change. Or wait, maybe when it's a reversible process at constant pressure, the formula simplifies.

Wait another approach: When a gas expands isobarically (constant pressure), the entropy change can be calculated using the relation ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1) + nCp ln(T2/T1). But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, I remember that for an ideal gas, the entropy change when going from state 1 to state 2 is ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1) + n Cv ln(T2/T1). But wait, no, that's when the process is not necessarily at constant pressure. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about using the formula for entropy change when pressure is constant. Since P is constant, the process is isobaric, so the work done is PΔV = nRT, but I'm not sure. Oh wait, for an ideal gas undergoing an isobaric expansion, the work done is W = P(V2 - V1) = nRT ln(V2/V1), because PV = nRT, so at constant P, V is proportional to T.

Wait, maybe I should approach it using the first law. The heat transferred in a reversible process at constant pressure is Q = n Cp ΔT. Because Cp is the heat capacity at constant pressure. And since entropy is Q_rev / T, we can write ΔS = Q / T = n Cp ΔT / T.

But I also know that for an ideal gas, Cp = (5/2) R for monatomic gases, but the question doesn't specify, so maybe I should keep it as Cp. Alternatively, perhaps I can express ΔT in terms of volume change.

Since the process is isobaric, using the ideal gas law, P V = n R T, so T = (P V)/(n R). So if the volume changes from V1 to V2, the temperature changes from T1 to T2 = (P V2)/(n R). So the ratio of temperatures would be T2/T1 = V2/V1. Because T1 = (P V1)/(n R), so T2/T1 = V2/V1.

Wait, that's an important relation: at constant pressure, T2/T1 = V2/V1. So, going back to the entropy formula: ΔS = n Cp ln(T2/T1). But since T2/T1 = V2/V1, we can substitute that in. So ΔS = n Cp ln(V2/V1).

Wait, but what is Cp in terms of R? For an ideal gas, Cp = (γ/(γ-1)) R, where γ is the heat capacity ratio, Cp/Cv = γ. For monatomic, γ is 5/3, so Cp would be (5/3)/(2/3) R = (5/2) R. But the problem doesn't specify whether it's monatomic or diatomic, so perhaps the formula is general.

But looking at the answer choices, I see options with terms like (5/2) Nk, etc. Wait, but in the problem statement, the gas has N molecules, so n would be N/NA. But in the options, it's just Nk, so perhaps the formula uses n as the number of moles, but the options express in terms of molecules. So let me adjust.

Wait, I think I might have confused n as moles. Let me clarify. The problem states N molecules. So n = N / Avogadro's number, N_A. So R = k N_A, where k is Boltzmann's constant. So, using n in terms of N, n = N/(N_A). So, any term with n R would be (N/(N_A)) * (k N_A) ) = Nk.

So, going back to ΔS = n Cp ln(V2/V1). Substituting n as N/(N_A), and R as k N_A. So, Cp for one mole is (5/2) R, so for n moles, it's n*(5/2 R) = (5/2) n R. But wait, n is N/(N_A), so substituting:

ΔS = [N/(N_A)] * (5/2 R) * ln(V2/V1)

But R is k N_A, so substituting R = k N_A:

ΔS = [N/(N_A)] * (5/2 * k N_A) ) * ln(V2/V1)

The N_A terms cancel out, so ΔS = N (5/2 k) ln(V2/V1) = (5/2) Nk ln(V2/V1).

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is (5/2) Nk ln(V2/V1), which would be (5/2) Nk times the natural log of (V2/V1). But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here.

Wait another thought: Alternatively, the entropy change when expanding at constant pressure is ΔS = n R ln(V2/V1) + n Cv ln(T2/T1). But since at constant pressure, T2 = T1 * (V2/V1), as derived earlier. So substituting T2/T1 = V2/V1, we get:

ΔS = n R ln(V2/V1) + n Cv ln(V2/V1) = n (R + Cv) ln(V2/V1).

But wait, for an ideal gas, Cv is (f/2) R, where f is degrees of freedom. For monatomic, f=3, so Cv=(3/2) R. Then R + Cv = R + (3/2 R) = (5/2) R. So ΔS = n (5/2 R) ln(V2/V1), which matches what I got earlier.

So, substituting n as N/(N_A), R = k N_A, so:

ΔS = (N/(N_A)) * (5/2) * k N_A * ln(V2/V1) = (5/2 Nk) ln(V2/V1).

Looking back at the options, option D is (5/2)Nk1n (V2/V1). Wait, but in the options, it's written as 1n which I think is a typo, probably meant ln. So option D is (5/2) Nk ln(V2/V1), which matches.

But wait, let me check the other options just to be sure. Option H is (6/2) Nk ln(V2/V1) which is 3 Nk ln(V2/V1), which would be if Cp were 3 R, but that's not correct. Option G is (3/2) Nk ln(V2/V1), which would be if Cp were (3/2 R), but that's Cv for monatomic, not Cp. So D seems correct.

Wait, but another thought: when the process is at constant pressure, the heat Q is given by Q = n Cp ΔT. And since ΔS = Q / T, but T changes, so we have to integrate. Wait, let me do that properly.

The entropy change for a reversible process is the integral of dQ_rev / T. At constant pressure, dQ = n Cp dT. So ΔS = ∫ (n Cp dT) / T from T1 to T2.

Since Cp is constant (ideal gas), it comes out of the integral. So ΔS = n Cp ∫ (dT/T) from T1 to T2. This gives n Cp ln(T2/T1).

But from the ideal gas law, since P is constant, T2/T1 = V2/V1. So substituting, ΔS = n Cp ln(V2/V1).

As before, since Cp is (5/2 R) for monatomic, so for N molecules, n = N/Avogadro. So substituting gives (5/2) Nk ln(V2/V1), which is option D.

To determine the entropy rise ∆S of an ideal gas of N molecules expanding from volume \( V_1 \) to \( V_2 \) under constant pressure, we use the thermodynamic relation for entropy change:

\[
\Delta S = n C_p \ln\left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right),
\]

where \( C_p \) is the molar heat capacity at constant pressure, and \( n \) is the number of moles of the gas. For an ideal gas, \( C_p = \frac{5}{2}R \), where \( R \) is the universal gas constant. Since the problem specifies \( N \) molecules, the number of moles is \( n = \frac{N}{N_A} \), where \( N_A \) is Avogadro's number. Substituting \( R = k N_A \), where \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, we find:

\[
\Delta S = \left(\frac{N}{N_A}\right) \left(\frac{5}{2} k N_A\right) \ln\left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right).
\]

Simplifying, the \( N_A \) terms cancel out, leaving:

\[
\Delta S = \frac{5}{2} Nk \ln\left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right).
\]

This matches the form of option D. The other options are inconsistent with the derived formula. For example:

- Option G corresponds to \( \frac{3}{2} Nk \ln\left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right) \), which would apply if \( C_p \) were \( \frac{3}{2}R \), but this is incorrect for an ideal gas.
- Option H corresponds to \( 3Nk \ln\left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right) \), which would imply \( C_p = 3R \), also incorrect.
- Option E involves \( \ln\left(\frac{V_1}{V_2}\right) \), which is the inverse of the correct volume ratio.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**D: \( \frac{5}{2} Nk \ln\left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right) \)**.
