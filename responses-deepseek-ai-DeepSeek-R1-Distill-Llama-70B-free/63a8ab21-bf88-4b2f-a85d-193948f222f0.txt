Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics question about the demand deposit multiplier and the total addition to demand deposits when a certain amount is deposited into a bank. Let me start by recalling what I know about this topic.

I remember that the demand deposit multiplier is related to the reserve requirement ratio. The formula I think is involved here is the multiplier, which is 1 divided by the reserve ratio. So if the reserve ratio is r, then the multiplier is 1/r. But wait, am I mixing that up with something else? Let me think again. Oh right, when a bank has to keep a certain percentage of deposits as reserves, the multiplier tells us how much the money supply increases due to fractional reserve banking.

So the question says that the required reserve ratio is 100%. That means the bank has to keep all of its deposits as reserves and can't lend any of it out. Because if the reserve ratio is 100%, the bank can't make any loans, right? So the multiplier would be different in this case.

Wait, if the reserve ratio is 100%, then the multiplier must be 1. Because the multiplier is 1/(reserve ratio). So 1 divided by 1 is 1. That makes sense because if the bank can't lend anything, the initial deposit just stays as is. So the demand deposit multiplier is 1.

Now, the total addition to demand deposits. If I deposit $100 into the bank, and the reserve ratio is 100%, the bank can't use any of that for loans. So the total demand deposits only increase by the initial $100. So the total addition is $100.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one has a multiplier of 1 and an addition of $100. Let's look through the options:

Option J says 1 and $100. That matches what I concluded. So the correct answer should be option J.

The demand deposit multiplier is calculated as the reciprocal of the reserve ratio. With a 100% reserve ratio, the multiplier is \( \frac{1}{1} = 1 \). This means the banking system cannot create additional money through lending, so the total addition to demand deposits is equal to the initial deposit of $100. 

Among the options provided, only option J correctly states the multiplier as 1 and the total addition to demand deposits as $100.

Answer: J
