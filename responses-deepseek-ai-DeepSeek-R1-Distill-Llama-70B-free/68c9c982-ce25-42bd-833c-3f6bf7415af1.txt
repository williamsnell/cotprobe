Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about geography terms, specifically regarding latitude and longitude coordinates. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking what kind of example latitude and longitude are. The options are A to J. I remember that latitude and longitude are specific measurements that pinpoint exact locations on Earth. So, I think they're related to absolute location because that's a fixed point, not relative.

Wait, what's the difference between absolute and relative location again? Absolute location is the exact spot, like using coordinates, whereas relative is more about where it is in relation to other places, like saying it's near a river or a mountain. So latitude and longitude must be absolute.

Looking at the options, I see option H is "an absolute location." That makes sense because those coordinates give precise, exact locations without needing references. Option E is "a formal region," which I think refers to areas defined by specific boundaries, like countries. That's not quite the same as coordinates. Option I is "a geospatial location," which sounds technical but I'm not sure if that's a standard term taught in geography basics.

So I'm pretty confident the answer is H. But wait, another thought: sometimes absolute location is also called a geospatial location. Or is that a different term? I think geospatial might be more about data related to geographic space, maybe a broader term. The question specifically mentions coordinates, which are exact points, so H still seems correct.

Another angle: formal regions are defined by homogeneous characteristics, like a country. So that's not it. Relative location is about position relative to other features. So no. Then there's option I, which I'm not sure about. Maybe it's a trick option. But I think the primary term is absolute location for coordinates.

So yeah, I'll go with H.

The latitude and longitude coordinates of a place are an example of an absolute location because they provide precise, fixed points on Earth's surface, independent of other references. 

Answer: H
