Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem says that a mass of 34.05 grams of H2O(s) at 273 K is dropped into 185 grams of H2O(l) at 310 K in an insulated container at 1 bar pressure. I need to find the equilibrium temperature once everything settles. The options are from A to J, with various temperatures.

Hmm, I remember that when substances are mixed, heat transfer occurs until thermal equilibrium is reached. Since the container is insulated, there's no heat exchange with the surroundings, so the heat lost by the warmer substance should equal the heat gained by the cooler one.

Wait, but here we have both solid and liquid water. Oh right, so the solid (ice) will probably absorb heat and melt, and the liquid water will release heat as it cools down. But wait, the ice is at the melting point, 273 K (0°C), right? Because that's its temperature.

So the ice will start to melt, absorbing heat. But the surrounding liquid water is at a higher temperature (310 K), so it will lose heat, cooling down. But wait, in an insulated container, the heat lost by the liquid equals the heat gained by the ice plus the heat needed to melt the ice. But wait, no—the initial ice is at 273 K, so when it melts, it turns into water at 273 K, and then that water will warm up to the final temperature.

Wait, but the final temperature should be somewhere between 273 K and 310 K. But considering the ice is melting, the final temp could be at 273 K if not enough heat is available to raise the temp beyond that. Or maybe not, because the liquid is hotter.

Wait, but if the ice is at 273 K and the liquid is at 310 K, the heat from the liquid will cause the ice to melt, and the melted water will then mix with the original liquid water, possibly raising the temperature. But wait, no, because the melted ice is at 273 K, so when it mixes with warmer water, the system will reach a temp somewhere in between.

Alternatively, perhaps the heat from the liquid water will melt the ice, and then the melted water (now at 273 K) will absorb more heat to raise its temperature. Meanwhile, the original liquid water will cool down, releasing heat.

But wait, the system is at 1 bar, so the melting point is 273 K. So when the ice melts, it stays at 273 K until all the ice is melted. But once melted, the water can then either stay at 273 K or possibly go higher if there's extra heat.

Wait, but the initial mass of ice is 34.05 grams, and the liquid is 185 grams. Let me calculate the heat involved.

First, let me think about the heat that the liquid water can lose. The formula for heat is q = m * c * ΔT, where m is mass, c is specific heat, and ΔT is change in temperature.

But the ice will first absorb heat to melt. The heat of fusion (ΔH_fus) for water is about 334 J/g (I think that's right). So melting 34.05 g of ice would require q = 34.05 g * 334 J/g. Let me compute that.

34.05 * 334 = let's see, 34 * 334 is 34*300=10,200 and 34*34=1,156, so total 11,356. 0.05 *334 is about 16.7, so total is approximately 11,372.7 J, which is 11,373 J or about 11.373 kJ.

Now, the liquid water will lose heat as it cools down. Let's say the final temperature is T. The initial temp of the liquid is 310 K. So the heat released by the liquid when cooling from 310 K to T is q = m * c * (310 - T).

The mass of the liquid is 185 g, which is 0.185 kg. The specific heat of liquid water is about 4.184 J/g·K, so 4184 J/kg·K.

So the heat released by the liquid is 0.185 kg * 4184 J/kg·K * (310 - T). That's 0.185 * 4184 * (310 - T). Let me compute the constants first: 0.185 * 4184 ≈ (0.2 *4184) is 836.8, but since it's 0.015 less, 0.015*4184≈62.76, so 836.8 - 62.76 = 774.04. So approximately 774 J/K * (310 - T).

Wait, but the heat from the liquid (q_liq) must provide the heat to melt the ice and then raise the temperature of the melted ice to T, plus the heat to cool the original liquid from 310 K to T. Or wait, no: the ice first melts at 273 K, then the melted water (now at 273 K) will be heated to T. So the heat required for the ice is in two parts: heat to melt it (q1) and heat to raise the temp of the melted water to T (q2).

So total heat gained by ice and melted water is q1 + q2.

q1 = mass_ice * ΔH_fus = 34.05 g * 334 J/g = 34.05 *334 = 11,372.7 J.

q2 = mass_ice * c_water * (T - 273) = 0.03405 kg * 4184 J/kg·K * (T-273).

The heat lost by the liquid water is q_liq = mass_liq * c_water * (310 - T) = 0.185 kg * 4184 J/kg·K * (310 - T).

Since the system is insulated, the heat lost by the liquid equals the heat gained by the ice and melted water.

So equation:

q_liq = q1 + q2.

Which is:

0.185 *4184*(310 - T) = 34.05*334 + (0.03405 *4184)*(T -273)

Let me compute the numbers.

First, compute each term:

Compute 34.05 *334 = 11,372.7 J.

Compute 0.03405 *4184 = approx 0.03405 *4000 = 136.2, but more accurately: 4184 * 0.03405 = let's compute 4184 *0.03 = 125.52; 4184 *0.00405 = approx 4184 *0.004 = 16.736, plus 4184 *0.00005=0.2092, so total 125.52 +16.736+0.2092≈142.465.

So 142.465 J/K (for q2's coefficient).

So the equation is:

0.185 *4184*(310 - T) = 11372.7 + 142.465*(T -273)

Compute 0.185 *4184 first. 0.185 *4000=740, 0.185*184= approx 34. So 740 +34=774 (exactly 774.04 as I had before). So 774.04*(310 - T) = 11372.7 +142.465*(T-273)

Let me expand both sides.

Left side: 774.04*(310 - T) = 774.04*310 - 774.04*T

Right side: 11372.7 +142.465*T -142.465*273

Calculate each term.

Compute 774.04 *310: Let's see, 700*310=217,000. 74.04*310: 70*310=21,700; 4.04*310≈1,252.4. So 21,700 +1,252.4=22,952.4. So total 217,000 +22,952.4=239,952.4 J.

So left side becomes 239,952.4 - 774.04 T.

Right side: 11,372.7 plus (142.465*T) minus (142.465*273).

Compute 142.465 *273: Let's approximate 140*273=38,220, 2.465*273≈673. So total approx 38,893 J.

So right side: 11,372.7 +142.465 T -38,893 = (11,372.7 -38,893) +142.465 T = (-27,520.3) +142.465 T.

Putting it all together:

239,952.4 -774.04 T = -27,520.3 +142.465 T.

Bring all terms to left side:

239,952.4 +27,520.3 = 774.04 T +142.465 T.

Compute left side: 239,952.4 +27,520.3 = 267,472.7.

Right side: (774.04 +142.465) T = 916.505 T.

So 267,472.7 =916.505 T.

Solve for T: T=267,472.7 /916.505 ≈ let's compute this.

Compute 916.505 * 292 = ?

Well, let's approximate.

916.5 * 290 = 916.5 *200=183,300; 916.5*90=82,485 → total 265,785.

Then 916.5 *2=1,833 → 265,785 +1,833=267,618.

But our numerator is 267,472.7, which is less than 267,618.

So 292 *916.5=267,618. Our numerator is 267,472.7, which is 267,618 - 145.3 less.

So 267,472.7 /916.5 ≈ 292 - (145.3/916.5). 145.3/916.5≈0.158. So T≈292 -0.158≈291.84 K.

Wait, but wait, because I think I made a mistake in the approximation. Let me compute more accurately.

Let me compute 916.505 * 292 = ?

916.505 * 292 = let's break it down:

916.505 * 200 = 183,301
916.505 *90 = 82,485.45
916.505 *2 = 1,833.01

Adding them: 183,301 +82,485.45 =265,786.45 +1,833.01=267,619.46.

Our left side is 267,472.7, which is less than 267,619.46 by 267,619.46 -267,472.7=146.76.

So 146.76 /916.505 ≈ 0.16.

So T=292 -0.16=291.84 K. Approximately 291.8 K, which is about 291.8 K.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is option H:292 K. But let me double-check my calculations because perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should carry out the division more accurately.

267,472.7 ÷916.505.

Let me compute 916.505 × 292 = 267,619.46 as above.

The difference is 267,472.7 -267,619.46 = -146.76.

So 146.76 /916.505 = approximately 0.16.

So 292 -0.16 =291.84 K, which is approximately 291.8 K. But none of the options exactly match. The options are A:298, B:290, C:300, D:275, E:280, F:285, G:305, H:292, I:315, J:273.

So option H is 292 K, which is very close to the calculated 291.8 K, so the correct answer should be H.

Wait, but wait a second. I assumed that all the ice melts, but maybe that's not the case. What if there's not enough heat from the liquid water to melt all the ice?

Ah, that's a possibility. Because if the heat released by the liquid water when cooling to 273 K is less than the heat required to melt the ice, then not all the ice would melt, and the final temperature would remain at 273 K.

So I need to check whether the heat that the liquid can release when cooling from 310 K to 273 K is enough to melt all the ice. If not, then the final temp is 273 K.

So let me compute the heat available when the liquid cools from 310 to 273 K.

q_liq_max = m * c * (310 -273) = 0.185 kg *4184 J/kg·K *37 K.

Compute that: 0.185 *4184 =774.04 J/K. Then multiply by 37 K: 774.04 *37.

Calculate 700*37=25,900; 74.04 *37≈2,739.48. So total≈25,900 +2,739.48=28,639.48 J.

The heat required to melt all the ice is 11,372.7 J, which is less than 28,639.48 J. So yes, the liquid can provide enough heat to melt all the ice, and there will be remaining heat to raise the temperature beyond 273 K.

Thus, the initial assumption holds, and the final temperature is approximately 292 K, which is option H.
</think>

To determine the equilibrium temperature of the system, we analyze the heat transfer between the ice and the liquid water in the insulated container. The system involves 34.05 g of ice at 273 K and 185 g of liquid water at 310 K. The heat lost by the liquid water as it cools will be used to melt the ice and then raise the temperature of the resulting water to the final equilibrium temperature.

### Key Steps:
1. **Heat required to melt the ice**:
   The heat of fusion for water is approximately \( \Delta H_{\text{fus}} = 334 \, \mathrm{J/g} \). The heat required to melt 34.05 g of ice is:
   \[
   q_1 = m_{\text{ice}} \cdot \Delta H_{\text{fus}} = 34.05 \, \mathrm{g} \cdot 334 \, \mathrm{J/g} = 11,372.7 \, \mathrm{J}.
   \]

2. **Heat released by the liquid water**:
   The liquid water cools from 310 K to the final temperature \( T \). The specific heat of liquid water is \( c_{\text{water}} = 4.184 \, \mathrm{J/g \cdot K} \). The heat released is:
   \[
   q_{\text{liq}} = m_{\text{liq}} \cdot c_{\text{water}} \cdot (310 - T),
   \]
   where \( m_{\text{liq}} = 185 \, \mathrm{g} = 0.185 \, \mathrm{kg} \). Substituting:
   \[
   q_{\text{liq}} = 0.185 \, \mathrm{kg} \cdot 4184 \, \mathrm{J/kg \cdot K} \cdot (310 - T) = 774.04 \, \mathrm{J/K} \cdot (310 - T).
   \]

3. **Heat required to warm the melted ice**:
   After melting, the 34.05 g of ice becomes water at 273 K. This water must then be heated to the final temperature \( T \). The heat required is:
   \[
   q_2 = m_{\text{ice}} \cdot c_{\text{water}} \cdot (T - 273),
   \]
   where \( m_{\text{ice}} = 34.05 \, \mathrm{g} = 0.03405 \, \mathrm{kg} \). Substituting:
   \[
   q_2 = 0.03405 \, \mathrm{kg} \cdot 4184 \, \mathrm{J/kg \cdot K} \cdot (T - 273) = 142.465 \, \mathrm{J/K} \cdot (T - 273).
   \]

4. **Energy balance**:
   In the insulated system, the heat lost by the liquid water equals the heat gained by the ice and the melted water:
   \[
   q_{\text{liq}} = q_1 + q_2.
   \]
   Substituting the expressions for \( q_{\text{liq}} \), \( q_1 \), and \( q_2 \):
   \[
   774.04 \cdot (310 - T) = 11,372.7 + 142.465 \cdot (T - 273).
   \]

5. **Solve for \( T \)**:
   Expanding and simplifying:
   \[
   239,952.4 - 774.04T = 11,372.7 + 142.465T - 38,893,
   \]
   \[
   267,472.7 = 916.505T.
   \]
   Solving for \( T \):
   \[
   T = \frac{267,472.7}{916.505} \approx 291.84 \, \mathrm{K}.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The equilibrium temperature is approximately \( 292 \, \mathrm{K} \), which corresponds to option **H**.
