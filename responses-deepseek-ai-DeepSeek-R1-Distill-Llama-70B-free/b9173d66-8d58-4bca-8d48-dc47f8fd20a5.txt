Okay, so I've got this question about the velocity of money, and I'm trying to figure it out. Hmm, I remember that velocity of money is a concept in economics that relates to how often money is spent in the economy. But wait, what's the exact formula again? I think it's something like velocity equals total transactions divided by the money supply, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think.

Oh right, the formula is Velocity (V) = Total Value of Transactions (PT) divided by Money Supply (M). So V = PT/M. That makes sense because if the money supply is high but transactions are low, the velocity would be lower, meaning money isn't moving around much.

In this problem, the total value of all transactions is $100,000. That's the PT part. And the money supply is $10,000, which is M. So plugging those numbers in, V should be 100,000 divided by 10,000. Let me do that math. 100,000 divided by 10,000 is 10, right? So V equals 10.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the formula. Sometimes I get confused between different formulas. Oh wait, another way to look at it is using GDP instead of total transactions. The formula using GDP is V = GDP/M. But since the question gives the total value of transactions, which I'm assuming is like the GDP or aggregate spending, it should work the same way.

So plugging in the numbers again: 100,000 divided by 10,000 equals 10. So the velocity is 10. Looking at the options, J is 10, so the correct answer should be J.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The formula seems straightforward, and the numbers are simple. Yeah, I'm confident that J is the right choice.

The velocity of money is calculated using the formula:

\[ V = \frac{\text{Total Value of Transactions (PT)}}{\text{Money Supply (M)}} \]

Given:
- Total Value of Transactions = \$100,000
- Money Supply = \$10,000

Plugging in the values:

\[ V = \frac{100,000}{10,000} = 10 \]

Thus, the velocity of money is 10.

The correct answer is **J**.
