Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the acceleration due to gravity on Mars for a robotic lander. Hmm, I remember that the acceleration due to gravity on a planet depends on the planet's mass and radius. Oh right, the formula for gravitational acceleration is g = G*M/(r²), where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the planet, and r is the radius of the planet.

Wait, I think the lander's weight on Earth is given as 3430 N. But wait, weight is mass times gravity, so maybe I can find the mass of the lander first. Oh wait, but no, in this problem, I don't think I need the lander's mass because the question is asking for the acceleration due to gravity on Mars, not the weight there. So maybe that 3430 N is a red herring, or perhaps it's just extra info. Let me double-check the question. Oh yeah, the question is asking for the acceleration, so I can ignore the weight part. Whew, that's a relief.

So, I need to calculate Mars' gravity. The given data are:
- Radius of Mars, R_M = 3.40e6 meters (that's 3.4 million meters)
- Mass of Mars, m_M = 6.42e23 kg
And I know the gravitational constant G is 6.674e-11 N·m²/kg².

Alright, let's plug these numbers into the formula. So g = G * M / R².

Wait, wait, I should make sure about the units. Let me see, G is in N·m²/kg², M is in kg, R is in meters. So when I multiply G*M, the units become N·m²/kg. Then dividing by R squared (m²) gives N/kg, which is equivalent to m/s². So the units will work out correctly.

Let me compute each part step by step. First, calculate R squared. R is 3.40e6 meters, so R squared is (3.4e6)^2.

3.4 squared is about 11.56, and (1e6)^2 is 1e12, so R² is 11.56e12 m², which is 1.156e13 m².

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 3.4 * 3.4 = 11.56. So yeah, (3.4e6)^2 = (3.4)^2 * (1e6)^2 = 11.56 * 1e12 = 1.156e13 m².

Next, calculate G*M. G is 6.674e-11 N·m²/kg², and M is 6.42e23 kg. So multiply them: 6.674e-11 * 6.42e23.

Let me compute 6.674 * 6.42 first. 6 times 6 is 36, but let's be precise. 6.674 *6 = 40.044. Then 6.674 * 0.42 is approximately 2.803. So total is 40.044 +2.803 = 42.847. So approximately 42.847e( -11 +23 ) = 42.847e12.

Wait, exponents: 6.674e-11 *6.42e23 = (6.674*6.42) * 1e(-11+23) )= 42.847e12, which is 4.2847e13.

Hmm, so G*M is approximately 4.2847e13 N·m²/kg.

Wait, let me double-check that multiplication. Actually, 6.674 *6.42: 6 *6 is 36, 6 *0.42 is 2.52, 0.674*6 is ~4.044, and 0.674 *0.42 is ~0.283. Wait, maybe I should do it properly.

Alternatively, 6.674 *6.42 = ?

Let me compute 6 * 6.42 = 38.52. Then 0.674 *6.42.

0.674 *6 =4.044, 0.674 *0.42=0.282. So 4.044 +0.282=4.326. So total is 38.52 +4.326=42.846. So yeah, 42.846. So 42.846e12, which is 4.2846e13.

Then, G*M = 4.2846e13.

Now, we have G*M / R² = 4.2846e13 / 1.156e13.

Wait, 4.2846e13 divided by 1.156e13 is 4.2846 /1.156.

Let me compute that division. Let's see, 4.2846 /1.156.

Hmm, 1.156 *3.7 = ?

1.156 *3 =3.468, 1.156 *0.7=0.8092 → sum is 3.468+0.8092=4.2772. Oh, that's very close to 4.2846. So 3.7 gives us 4.2772, but our numerator is 4.2846. So the difference is 4.2846 -4.2772=0.0074.

So 0.0074/(1.156) ≈ 0.0064. So the total is approximately 3.7 +0.0064≈3.7064.

Wait, that's around 3.7 m/s². But let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

Wait, another approach: 3.7 *1.156 = 4.2772, as before. So 4.2846 is 0.0074 higher than 4.2772. So 3.7 + (0.0074/1.156).

0.0074/1.156 = approximately 0.0064, so 3.7064.

So approximately 3.706 m/s². Let me check the options. The options are A:3.3, B:2.4, C:7.1, D:6.0, E:6.5, F:4.1, G:3.7, H:5.2, I:4.9, J:5.9.

So option G is 3.7. But wait, my calculation gives 3.706, which is approximately 3.71, which is closer to 3.7. So the answer should be G.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, G is 6.674e-11, M is 6.42e23.

So 6.674e-11 *6.42e23 = (6.674 *6.42) *1e( -11 +23 )= 42.846 *1e12 =4.2846e13.

R is 3.4e6 m, so R squared is (3.4e6)^2= 11.56e12=1.156e13 m².

So 4.2846e13 /1.156e13 = 4.2846/1.156 ≈3.706.

So 3.706 m/s². So the closest option is G:3.7.

Wait, but sometimes when I compute, I might have made an error in the exponents. Let me recheck.

Yes, 3.4e6 is 3,400,000 meters. Squared is 3.4^2=11.56, times (1e6)^2=1e12, so 11.56e12 which is 1.156e13 m².

G*M: 6.674e-11 *6.42e23 = 6.674 *6.42 = 42.84 approx, and exponents: 1e-11 *1e23 =1e12. So 42.84e12 =4.284e13.

Divide that by 1.156e13 gives 4.284 /1.156 ≈3.706.

So the correct answer is G, 3.7.

Wait, but wait, I remember that Mars' gravity is about 3.71 m/s², which matches this. So yeah, the correct option is G.

To determine the acceleration due to gravity on Mars, we use the formula:

\[
g = \frac{G \cdot M}{R^2}
\]

where:
- \( G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{kg}^2 \) (gravitational constant),
- \( M = 6.42 \times 10^{23} \, \text{kg} \) (mass of Mars),
- \( R = 3.40 \times 10^6 \, \text{m} \) (radius of Mars).

### Step 1: Calculate \( R^2 \)
\[
R^2 = (3.40 \times 10^6)^2 = 3.4^2 \cdot (10^6)^2 = 11.56 \cdot 10^{12} = 1.156 \times 10^{13} \, \text{m}^2
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( G \cdot M \)
\[
G \cdot M = (6.674 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot (6.42 \times 10^{23}) = 42.846 \cdot 10^{12} = 4.2846 \times 10^{13} \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{kg}
\]

### Step 3: Divide \( G \cdot M \) by \( R^2 \)
\[
g = \frac{4.2846 \times 10^{13}}{1.156 \times 10^{13}} = \frac{4.2846}{1.156} \approx 3.706 \, \text{m/s}^2
\]

### Step 4: Match the result to the closest option
The calculated value of \( g \) is approximately \( 3.706 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), which is closest to option **G: 3.7**.

### Final Answer:
G
