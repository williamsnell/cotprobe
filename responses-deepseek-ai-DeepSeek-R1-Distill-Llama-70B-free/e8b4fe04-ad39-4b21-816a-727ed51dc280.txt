Question:

A city imposes a municipal excise tax of $200 per year on commercial artists' studios in that city. It also imposes an excise tax of $100 per year on every itinerant commercial figure drawer for the privilege of using the streets and sidewalks. A credit is allowed against this latter tax for any excise tax paid to the city by the drawer or his employer in respect to the maintenance of an artist's studio in the city. A gallery, located in a neighboring state, has been sending two itinerant artists into the city. Their practice is to draw a picture of a pedestrian, ask him to order a finished painting, and collect a payment of $2. 00. The drawing is sent to a studio, which frames it and mails the framed painting to the customer. The neighboring state does not impose a tax on artists' studios. The gallery challenges the constitutionality of the $100 per year excise tax that is imposed upon its itinerant artists in the city. The court will most likely declare this tax

Options:

A: constitutional, as a valid ad valorem tax on interstate commerce.
B: unconstitutional, as a discriminatory privilege tax.
C: constitutional, as it is a valid usage fee for public property.
D: constitutional, as the tax is a valid exercise of the city's power to regulate commerce.
E: unconstitutional, as it violates the principle of equal protection under the law.
F: constitutional, since the tax was levied not on the commercial art business as a whole but on the local activity of drawing pictures.
G: unconstitutional, since the tax unfairly burdens out-of-state businesses.
H: unconstitutional, since a state or municipality may not impose a license tax on orders for goods or services to be perfonned in another state.
I: unconstitutional, since it amounts to double taxation.

Okay, so I have this law question here about municipal excise taxes and their constitutionality. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's break it down step by step.

Alright, the scenario is that a city imposes two taxes. First, a $200 annual excise tax on commercial artists' studios. Second, a $100 annual tax on itinerant commercial figure drawers for using streets and sidewalks. There's a credit allowed against the latter tax if the drawer or employer has paid the studio tax.

Now, a gallery in a neighboring state sends two artists into the city. These artists draw pictures of pedestrians, ask them to order a painting, collect $2, and then the drawing is sent to a studio where it's framed and mailed. The neighboring state doesn't tax studios. The gallery is challenging the $100 tax on the itinerant artists.

So, the question is whether this tax is constitutional. The options are A through I, each giving different reasons.

I remember that taxes on interstate commerce can be tricky. The Constitution's Commerce Clause comes into play here. States and municipalities can't impose taxes that unduly burden or discriminate against interstate commerce.

Looking at the tax structure: The city taxes local studios at $200 and itinerant artists at $100, but with a credit if they've already paid the studio tax. So, if an artist is part of a studio in the city, they don't have to pay the $100. But if they're from out of state, like the gallery here, their artists don't have a city studio, so they have to pay the $100.

Wait, the gallery is in a neighboring state, so their artists don't maintain a studio in the city. Therefore, they can't claim the credit. So they have to pay the full $100.

Is this tax discriminatory? Let me think. The tax applies to all itinerant drawers, whether from in-state or out-of-state. But the credit is only for those connected to a local studio. So out-of-state businesses can't get the credit because they don't have a local studio. So effectively, they're paying more than local businesses.

This sounds like a possible discrimination against interstate commerce. Because the tax is the same for everyone, but the credit benefits only local studios. So the out-of-state itinerant artists end up paying more.

Wait, but the tax is imposed on the activity of using streets and sidewalks. Is that a valid basis? Or does it matter because the effect is to tax interstate commerce?

I recall the case of Toxel v. McGillin, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, cases about municipal taxes on peddlers or itinerant vendors.

Another point: the tax is on the privilege of using the streets and sidewalks. So maybe it's a valid usage fee. But if it's applied in a way that discriminates against out-of-state businesses, it could be unconstitutional.

Wait, in the case of New York v. United States, the Supreme Court has held that states can't tax in a way that discriminates against interstate commerce. So if the tax here creates a differential burden, it's a problem.

So the itinerant artists from out of state have to pay $100, while local artists (if they have a studio) pay nothing because of the credit. That's a disparate impact. So it's a discriminatory tax.

Looking at the options, option B says unconstitutional as a discriminatory privilege tax. Option G says unconstitutional because it burdens out-of-state businesses.

Wait, option B is about being a privilege tax that's discriminatory. Option G is about the burden on out-of-state businesses. Which is it?

The tax is a privilege tax on the activity, but it's applied in a way that only out-of-state businesses end up paying it, since in-state can get the credit. So perhaps it's a discriminatory tax against interstate commerce.

Alternatively, option F says it's constitutional because it's on the local activity of drawing. But the issue is whether that's a valid basis to tax without discriminating.

Wait, the tax is on the activity conducted within the city (using streets). So it's a local activity, but the problem is the credit which effectively favors local businesses.

So the tax itself is on a local activity, but the credit creates an unequal burden. Therefore, the tax might be found unconstitutional because of the credit, making it discriminatory.

So the correct answer would be either B or G. Let me think again.

Option B: unconstitutional as a discriminatory privilege tax. Because the tax is the same, but the credit makes it so that only out-of-state pay it, thus it's discriminatory.

Option G: unconstitutional because it burdens out-of-state businesses. It's about the effect, not the structure.

I think the correct reasoning is that the tax is discriminatory. So option B is the right choice.

The city imposes a $200 annual excise tax on commercial artists' studios and a $100 annual tax on itinerant commercial figure drawers for using streets and sidewalks. A credit is available against the latter tax if the drawer or employer has paid the studio tax. A gallery in a neighboring state challenges the $100 tax on its itinerant artists, who do not maintain a studio in the city and thus cannot claim the credit.

The issue revolves around whether the tax violates the Commerce Clause by discriminating against interstate commerce. While the tax is imposed on a local activity (using streets and sidewalks), the credit disproportionately benefits local businesses with studios in the city. Out-of-state businesses, like the gallery, cannot claim the credit and thus bear the full $100 tax, creating a disparate burden on interstate commerce.

This differential treatment makes the tax discriminatory, as it effectively penalizes out-of-state businesses. The tax structure violates the principle of nondiscrimination under the Commerce Clause, making it unconstitutional. The correct answer is:

**B: unconstitutional, as a discriminatory privilege tax.**
