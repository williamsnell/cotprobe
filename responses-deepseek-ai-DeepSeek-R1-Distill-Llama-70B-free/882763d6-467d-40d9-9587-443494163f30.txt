Question:

A 16-year-old male is brought to the emergency department with sudden-onset swelling of the right knee. He denies any trauma. Past medical history reveals cystic fibrosis. Examination of the knee reveals fluctuance on palpation of the joint but no increased warmth; mild restriction in range of motion due to the swelling is also noted. Numerous bruises are noted in various stages of resolution. Further history reveals easy bruising and bleeding from the gums over the past month. The most likely explanation for these findings is

Options:

A: acquired factor VIII deficiency
B: diffuse intravascular coagulation secondary to infection
C: hypocomplementemia
D: malabsorption of vitamins A, D, E, and K

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this medical question. Let me read it carefully and break it down step by step. 

The patient is a 16-year-old male who comes to the emergency department with sudden swelling in his right knee. He says there was no trauma involved. His past medical history includes cystic fibrosis. On examination, the knee has fluctuance when palpated, which suggests there's fluid in the joint, like a effusion. There's no increased warmth, so maybe it's not an acute inflammatory or infectious process. He also has some restriction in moving the knee because of the swelling.

Additionally, the patient has numerous bruises in various stages of healing. He reports easy bruising and bleeding from the gums for the past month. So, this makes me think about a bleeding disorder.

Looking at the possible options:

Option A: Acquired factor VIII deficiency. Factor VIII is involved in blood clotting. A deficiency here would cause bleeding issues, like hemophilia A. But acquired usually means something like an autoimmune condition where antibodies against factor VIII are present. I'm not sure if this is linked to cystic fibrosis.

Option B: Diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC) secondary to infection. DIC is when there's widespread clotting and bleeding in the small blood vessels. It can happen due to infections, trauma, etc. It leads to both thrombosis and bleeding as clotting factors get consumed. But would this cause joint swelling without trauma? Also, the patient's history of cystic fibrosis might make him prone to infections, but I'm not sure if this is the primary issue here.

Option C: Hypocomplementemia. This refers to low levels of complement proteins in the blood. Complements are part of the immune system, involved in fighting off infections. Low levels can be seen in conditions like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or chronic infections. But how does this relate to the bleeding and joint findings here? I'm not sure. Maybe SLE can cause joint issues, but the bleeding gums don't fit as well.

Option D: Malabsorption of vitamins A, D, E, and K. Cystic fibrosis often affects the pancreas, leading to fat malabsorption. These vitamins are fat-soluble, so if he's not absorbing them properly, that could cause deficiencies. Vitamin K is crucial for blood clotting. A deficiency in vitamin K would lead to bleeding problems because clotting factors (like prothrombin and others) depend on it. So if he's malabsorbing vitamin K, he might have easy bruising, gum bleeding, and possibly bleeding into joints, causing the swelling.

The knee swelling could be due to a hemorrhosis, which is bleeding into the joint space. This is common in bleeding disorders like hemophilia, but since the patient has a history of cystic fibrosis, which can cause malabsorption, maybe he's not getting enough vitamin K. That would impair clotting, causing these symptoms.

So putting it together: cystic fibrosis leads to malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins, including K. Without enough vitamin K, the body can't make clotting factors, leading to easy bleeding and bruising. The knee swelling is likely due to bleeding into the joint from minor trauma or spontaneous bleeding because of the clotting issue.

The patient is a 16-year-old male with cystic fibrosis who presents with sudden-onset knee swelling, fluctuance on palpation, and no warmth, suggesting a non-inflammatory joint effusion. He also has a history of easy bruising, gum bleeding, and multiple bruises in various stages of healing, indicating a bleeding disorder. The key to this case lies in the patient's cystic fibrosis, which often causes pancreatic insufficiency and subsequent malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamin K. Vitamin K is essential for the production of clotting factors, and its deficiency can lead to bleeding manifestations such as easy bruising, gum bleeding, and hemorrhosis (bleeding into joints), which explains the knee swelling.

Option A, acquired factor VIII deficiency, typically involves autoimmune mechanisms and is not directly linked to cystic fibrosis or malabsorption. Option B, DIC secondary to infection, is unlikely as there are no signs of infection or systemic inflammation. Option C, hypocomplementemia, is more associated with immune disorders like SLE and does not explain the bleeding symptoms. Option D, malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins, aligns with the patient's cystic fibrosis and the observed bleeding manifestations due to vitamin K deficiency.

The most likely explanation is malabsorption of vitamins A, D, E, and K, particularly vitamin K, leading to a bleeding disorder.
