Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Oh right, it's about work done against friction and converting that into watts and horsepower. Hmm, I remember some of this from my classes.

Alright, the problem says: A mass of 100 kilograms is pushed along the floor at a constant rate of 2 m/sec. The coefficient of sliding friction is 0.25. I need to find the rate at which work is being done, in watts and horsepower. The options are A through J.

First, I think I need to calculate the force of friction because the work done against friction would relate to that. Friction is the opposing force here. The formula for friction force is F_friction = μ * N, where μ is the coefficient of friction and N is the normal force.

Wait, the normal force N is equal to the weight of the object when it's on a flat surface, right? So N = m * g, where m is mass and g is the acceleration due to gravity. Let me plug in the numbers. The mass is 100 kg, so N = 100 kg * 9.8 m/s². Let me calculate that: 100 * 9.8 is 980 Newtons.

So now the friction force F is μ (0.25) times 980 N. Let me do that multiplication: 0.25 * 980. 0.25 is a quarter, so a quarter of 980 is 245. So F_friction is 245 Newtons.

Now that I have the force, I need to find the power. Power is the rate at which work is done, and since the object is moving at a constant velocity, the power is just the force times the velocity. The formula is P = F * v.

The velocity given is 2 m/s. So P = 245 N * 2 m/s. Let's compute that: 245 * 2 is 490. So the power is 490 watts. Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 490 watts, 0.66 hp. Option I is 500, 0.67. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, let me double-check the friction calculation. Oh wait, wait. The normal force is m * g, which is 100 kg * 9.8. 100*9 is 900, 100*.8 is 80, so 980. Correct. Then 0.25 times 980 is 245. That seems right.

Then 245 N times 2 m/s is 490 W. So 490 watts. Now, converting watts to horsepower. I remember that 1 horsepower (hp) is equal to 745.7 watts. So to find how many hp 490 watts is, I divide 490 by 745.7.

Let me do that division. 490 / 745.7. Hmm, let's approximate. Let's see, 745.7 is about 746. 490 divided by 746 is approximately 0.657. So roughly 0.657 hp. Looking at the options, option A is 0.66 hp. That matches.

But wait, let me check the options again. Option A is 490 watts, 0.66 hp. Option I is 500 watts, 0.67. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the division.

Let me calculate 490 divided by 745.7 more accurately. Let's see:

745.7 is approximately 745.7. So 490 ÷ 745.7.

Well, 745.7 * 0.66 is 745.7 * (2/3)= approx 497. So 0.66 *745.7 is about 492. So 490 is a bit less than that. So 490 would be a little less than 0.66 hp. Wait, but that can't be right because 490 is less than 492. So 0.66 would give 492, so 490 would be about 0.658, which is approximately 0.66 when rounded to two decimal places.

So the answer should be 490 watts and approximately 0.66 hp, which is option A.

Wait, but some of the other options have higher wattage. Did I make a mistake in calculating the friction force? Let me check again.

Wait, another thought: the mass is 100 kg, but is the normal force really m*g? Yes, because the object is on a flat horizontal surface, so N equals mg. So that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider using 9.81 instead of 9.8 for g? Let's recalculate with g=9.81.

N = 100 * 9.81 = 981 N. Then F_friction is 0.25 * 981 = 245.25 N. Then power is 245.25 * 2 = 490.5 W. So about 490.5 W, which is about 490.5, which is still close to 490. So when converted to hp, it's still approximately 490.5 / 745.7 = let me compute that.

Let me compute 490.5 ÷ 745.7.

I can write it as 490.5 /745.7 = ?

Let me compute 745.7 × 0.66 = ?

0.66 × 700 = 462

0.66 × 45.7 = 30.162

So 462 +30.162=492.162. So 745.7 ×0.66 is about 492.16.

But 490.5 is less than that. So 490.5 is 492.16 minus about 1.66.

So 490.5 is 745.7 × (0.66 - (1.66/745.7)).

1.66 /745.7 is approximately 0.00223. So 0.66 - 0.00223 = 0.65777.

So around 0.6578 hp, which is approximately 0.66 hp when rounded to two decimal places.

So the answer should be 490 watts and 0.66 hp, which is option A.

But wait, looking at the options again, option A is 490 watts, 0.66 hp. Option B is 500, 0.68. Option I is 500, 0.67.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps. Let me think again.

Wait, is the formula for power correct? Power is indeed force times velocity when the force is applied in the direction of motion. Since we're pushing against friction, yes, that's correct.

Wait, another possibility: did I forget to convert the mass into something else? No, because kg is correct in SI units.

Wait, but wait another thing: when you have work done against friction, the work per unit time (power) is force * velocity. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, maybe the question is about the rate at which work is done in watts and in horsepower. So the calculations seem right.

So why do some options have higher values? Maybe because of rounding during the calculation steps.

Wait, perhaps when calculating the friction force, using more precise values for g would change things.

Wait, if g is exactly 9.80665 m/s², then N = 100 *9.80665=980.665 N.

F_friction = 0.25 * 980.665 =245.16625 N.

Power is 245.16625 *2=490.3325 W, which is about 490.33 W.

In hp: 490.33 /745.7 ≈0.6577 hp.

So 0.6577 is approximately 0.66 hp.

So that's still option A.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the velocity is in miles per hour or something else? No, the question says 2 m/s, so velocity is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to calculate the power in a different way, like considering kinetic energy? No, because when moving at constant velocity, power is simply F*v.

Hmm, perhaps I should look if any of the other options are close to my calculation. Let me see the options again.

Option A: 490, 0.66.

Option B:500, 0.68.

Option I:500, 0.67.

Option E:520, 0.70.

So, why is option B 500 W? Let me see if I missed something. Maybe I miscalculated the friction force.

Wait, maybe I should recalculate F_friction.

Wait, 100 kg *9.8 m/s² is 980 N. 0.25 *980 =245 N. That's correct.

Power is 245 *2=490 W. So 490 W is correct.

So unless I made a mistake in the calculation, the correct answer should be option A.

But wait, looking at the options, option I has 500 W and 0.67 hp. How would someone get 500 W?

Ah, perhaps if they used g as exactly 10 m/s² for simplicity. Let's try that.

If g=10, then N=100*10=1000 N.

Friction F=0.25 *1000=250 N.

Power P=250 *2=500 W.

Ah, there we go. So if someone approximates g as 10 instead of 9.8, then they get 500 W.

In that case, 500 W would be the power.

Then, converting 500 W to hp: 500 /745.7 ≈0.6706 hp, which is approximately 0.67 hp. So that would correspond to option I: 500 W, 0.67 hp. But wait, option I has 0.67, but option B has 0.68.

Wait, let me compute 500/745.7.

745.7 goes into 500 how many times?

745.7 *0.67= let's calculate 0.67*745.7.

0.6 *745.7=447.42.

0.07 *745.7=52.199.

Adding them: 447.42 +52.199= 499.619. So 0.67 hp is about 499.62 W.

But 500 W is 500/745.7 ≈0.6706 hp.

So 0.6706 is approximately 0.67 hp when rounded to two decimal places.

So with g=10, the answer would be 500 W and 0.67 hp, which is option I.

But the precise calculation with g=9.8 gives 490 W and 0.6577 hp, which is approximately 0.66 hp, option A.

So which one is correct? Well, in physics problems, unless stated otherwise, it's more accurate to use g=9.8 m/s². So the correct answer should be option A.

But wait, the options don't have that. Let me look again.

Wait, the options are:

A:490,0.66

B:500,0.68

I:500,0.67

So if the question uses g=9.8, the answer is A.

If it uses g=10, the answer is I.

Which approach is correct? Typically, in exams, sometimes g is taken as 10 for simplicity, but in more precise problems, 9.8 is used.

In the question, the given values are quite precise—coefficient is 0.25, velocity is 2.00 m/s, mass is 100 kg. So perhaps the expectation is to use g=9.8.

Wait, but in that case, option A is correct. So why isn't option A the choice? But let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the conversion from watts to horsepower. Let me recheck that.

1 hp = 745.7 W.

So 490 W divided by 745.7 W/hp equals approximately 0.6577 hp.

So 0.6577 is approximately 0.66 when rounded to two decimal places. So option A states 0.66 hp, which is correct.

But another thought: perhaps there's a miscalculation in the power. Let me recheck.

F=245 N, v=2 m/s.

Power P= F*v =245 *2=490 W. Correct.

So unless I made a mistake, option A is correct.

Wait, but looking back at the options, I just noticed that option I is 500 W, 0.67 hp. That's what you get if you take g=10.

So maybe the question expects you to use g=10. But that's not clear. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects to use F = μ * m * g, which when g=9.8 gives 245 N, leading to 490 W, as before.

So I think the correct answer is option A.

But wait, looking at the options again, perhaps option I is an alternative.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is about the work done by friction, but the work done by the applied force? No, the question says "work being done in watts", and in the context of pushing, it's the power expended to overcome friction.

So I think I'm confident that option A is correct.
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the rate at which work is being done in watts and then convert it to horsepower. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Calculate the normal force**:  
   The normal force \( N \) is equal to the weight of the object, given by:  
   \[
   N = m \cdot g
   \]  
   Substituting \( m = 100 \, \text{kg} \) and \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \):  
   \[
   N = 100 \cdot 9.8 = 980 \, \text{N}
   \]

2. **Calculate the friction force**:  
   The friction force \( F_{\text{friction}} \) is given by:  
   \[
   F_{\text{friction}} = \mu \cdot N
   \]  
   Substituting \( \mu = 0.25 \) and \( N = 980 \, \text{N} \):  
   \[
   F_{\text{friction}} = 0.25 \cdot 980 = 245 \, \text{N}
   \]

3. **Calculate the power in watts**:  
   Power \( P \) is the product of force and velocity:  
   \[
   P = F_{\text{friction}} \cdot v
   \]  
   Substituting \( F_{\text{friction}} = 245 \, \text{N} \) and \( v = 2 \, \text{m/s} \):  
   \[
   P = 245 \cdot 2 = 490 \, \text{W}
   \]

4. **Convert power to horsepower**:  
   Using the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{hp} = 745.7 \, \text{W} \):  
   \[
   P_{\text{hp}} = \frac{P}{745.7} = \frac{490}{745.7} \approx 0.6577 \, \text{hp}
   \]  
   Rounding to two decimal places:  
   \[
   P_{\text{hp}} \approx 0.66 \, \text{hp}
   \]

5. **Match the results to the options**:  
   The calculated values are \( 490 \, \text{W} \) and \( 0.66 \, \text{hp} \), which correspond to **Option A**.

If \( g \) were approximated as \( 10 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), the calculations would yield \( 500 \, \text{W} \) and \( 0.67 \, \text{hp} \), corresponding to **Option I**. However, since the problem does not specify using \( g = 10 \), the more precise value of \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) should be used, making **Option A** the correct choice.

**Final Answer**:  
A: 490 watts, 0.66 hp  

Answer: A
