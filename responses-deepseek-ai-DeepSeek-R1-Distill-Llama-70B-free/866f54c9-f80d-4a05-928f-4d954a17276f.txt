Okay, so I've got this transmission line problem to solve. Hmm, the question is about finding the characteristic impedance and phase velocity at a specific frequency. The given constants are R, G, L, C. Wait, let me jot those down.

So the parameters are R = 10^-2 ohm/m, G = 1e-6 mho/m, L = 1e-6 Henry/m, and C = 1e-9 Farad/m. The frequency is 1590 Hz. 

I remember that the characteristic impedance Z0 of a transmission line is given by the square root of (R + jωL) divided by (G + jωC). Oh right, but wait, when ω is much larger than R/L and G/C, the terms jωL and jωC dominate, so we can approximate. But I'm not sure if that's the case here. Let me check the values.

Calculating ω first. ω = 2πf. So 2 * π * 1590 ≈ 10000 radians per second. 

So R is 0.01 ohm/m. Let's compute R/(jωL). R is 0.01, ωL is 1e4 * 1e-6 = 0.01. So R/(jωL) is 0.01 / j0.01 = 1/j, which is -j. Hmm, interesting. So R is equal to ωL at this frequency. So R + jωL becomes 0.01 + j (0.01) * j? Wait, wait, no. Wait, jωL is j * 0.01. So R is 0.01, and jωL is j * 0.01. So R + jωL is 0.01 + j0.01. So magnitude is sqrt( (0.01)^2 + (0.01)^2 ) = 0.01414 ohms. Hmm, not negligible.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. R is 0.01, ωL is 0.01. So the real part is 0.01, the imaginary part is 0.01. So the ratio R/(ωL) is 1. So they are of the same magnitude. So this isn't a case where R is negligible compared to ωL, or vice versa. So I can't ignore R or G in this case. So I need to compute the exact expression.

Same for G and ωC. G is 1e-6. ωC is 1e4 *1e-9 = 1e-5. So G/(ωC) is (1e-6)/(1e-5) = 0.1. So G is 0.1 times ωC. So G is 0.1 of ωC, meaning jωC is larger, but not so much that G can be ignored. Hmm, so perhaps we can't make approximations here, and have to calculate the actual values.

So the formula for Z0 is sqrt( (R + jωL) / (G + jωC) ). Let me compute the numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: R + jωL = 0.01 + j * 0.01. So that's a complex number with real and imaginary parts both 0.01.

Denominator: G + jωC = 1e-6 + j * 1e-5. So G is 1e-6, jωC is 1e-5. So the real part is 0.000001, and the imaginary part is 0.00001.

So the numerator is 0.01 + j0.01. The denominator is 0.000001 + j0.00001.

Wait, but when taking the square root, it's easier to compute the magnitude and the angle first.

The characteristic impedance magnitude is sqrt( (R^2 + (ωL)^2) / (G^2 + (ωC)^2) ) ).

R^2 is (0.01)^2 = 1e-4.

(ωL)^2 is (0.01)^2 = 1e-4.

So numerator of magnitude squared is 1e-4 + 1e-4 = 2e-4.

Denominator: G^2 is (1e-6)^2 = 1e-12. (ωC)^2 is (1e-5)^2 = 1e-10.

So denominator is 1e-12 + 1e-10 = 1.01e-10.

So the magnitude squared is (2e-4) / (1.01e-10) ) ≈ (2e-4)/(1e-10) )= 2e6. So square root is sqrt(2e6) ≈ sqrt(2)*1e3 ≈ 1414 Ohms. Wait, that can't be right because the options are all around 30-40. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait wait, let me double-check. Oh wait, I think I messed up the units. Wait, the given parameters are per meter, but when calculating Z0, we don't have any length because it's per unit length. So the units should be Ohms.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the magnitude calculation. Let me recalculate.

Numerator: (R^2 + (ωL)^2) = (0.01)^2 + (0.01)^2 = 0.0001 + 0.0001 = 0.0002.

Denominator: (G^2 + (ωC)^2) = (1e-6)^2 + (1e-5)^2 = 1e-12 + 1e-10 = 1.01e-10.

So the magnitude of Z0 is sqrt( (0.0002) / (1.01e-10) ) ).

Wait, 0.0002 is 2e-4. So 2e-4 / 1.01e-10 = (2/1.01) * 1e6 ≈ 1.98e6. sqrt(1.98e6) = approx 1407 Ohms. But that's way higher than any of the options. So something's wrong here.

Wait, maybe I should think again. Oh, wait! Because ω is 1e4 rad/s, but R is 1e-2, so ωL is 1e4 * 1e-6 = 0.01. Same as R. So R + jωL is 0.01 + j0.01, which has a magnitude of sqrt(0.01^2 +0.01^2 )= ~0.01414. Similarly, the denominator is G + jωC: 1e-6 + j (1e4 * 1e-9 )= 1e-6 + j 1e-5. So the magnitude is sqrt( (1e-6)^2 + (1e-5)^2 )= sqrt(1e-12 +1e-10 )= sqrt(1.01e-10 )≈ 1e-5. 

So the overall magnitude of Z0 is (0.01414) / (1e-5 ) ≈ 1414 Ohms. But the options are around 30-40 Ohms. So what's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the numerator and denominator. Because Z0 is sqrt( (R + jωL)/(G + jωC) ). So Z0 is sqrt( (0.01 + j0.01) / (1e-6 + j1e-5) ). So let's compute this as a complex division.

Let me write the numerator as 0.01(1 + j1), and the denominator as 1e-6 + j1e-5 = 1e-6 (1 + j10).

So the ratio is [0.01(1 + j)] / [1e-6 (1 + j10) ) ].

That simplifies to (0.01 / 1e-6) * (1+j)/(1 + j10).

0.01 /1e-6 = 10^4 * 0.01 = 10000 *0.01=100? Wait, 0.01 is 1e-2, 1e-2 /1e-6 = 1e4. Oh right, 1e4 is 10000.

So the ratio is 10000 * (1 +j )/(1 + j10).

Now, let's compute (1 +j)/(1 +j10).

Multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator:

(1 +j)(1 -j10) / [ (1)^2 + (10)^2 ) ] = [ (1)(1) + (1)(-j10) + j(1) + j(-j10) ) ] / (1 + 100).

Simplify numerator:

1 -j10 +j -j^2 10.

j^2 is -1, so -j^2 10 is +10.

So 1 +10 + (-j10 +j ) = 11 -j9.

Denominator is 101.

So the ratio becomes (11 -j9)/101 = (11/101) -j (9/101).

So now, the overall ratio is 1e4 * [ (11 -j9)/101 ) ] = (1e4 /101 ) * (11 -j9).

1e4 is 10000, 10000/101 ≈ 99.0099.

So 99.0099 * (11 -j9 ) ≈ 99*(11) = 1089, and 99*(-j9)= -891j. But wait, no, wait. Wait, 99.0099 * 11 is about 1089.11, and 99.0099 * (-j9) is about -891.09j.

Wait, so the numerator of the ratio is approximately (1089.11 - j891.09). So the ratio (R+jωL)/(G+jωC) is approximately (1089 -j891).

Wait, but that's the ratio before taking the square root for Z0. So Z0 is sqrt( (1089 -j891) ). Hmm, but wait, I think I made a mistake because the ratio is 1e4 * (1+j)/(1 + j10) which came to 99*(11 -j9) approximately. So 11 -j9 has a magnitude of sqrt(11^2 +9^2 )= sqrt(202)=~14.2, and angle arctan(9/11)= about 39.8 degrees. So the ratio is (1e4 /101 ) * 14.2 e^{j (-39.8)}.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute the magnitude and angle separately.

Wait, the numerator (1+j) has magnitude sqrt(2) ≈1.414, angle 45 degrees. The denominator (1 +j10) has magnitude sqrt(1 +100)=sqrt(101)≈10.05, angle arctan(10/1)= 84.26 degrees.

So the ratio is (1.414 /10.05 ) * e^{j (45 -84.26)} = (0.1407) * e^{-j39.26°}.

Multiply by 1e4: 0.1407 *1e4 = 1407. e^{-j39.26° }.

So Z0 is the square root of this. So the magnitude is sqrt(1407) ≈37.54 Ohms. The angle becomes half of -39.26, so about -19.63 degrees. So approximately 37.5 Ohms at an angle of -20 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is Z0=37.5 angle -20 Ohms, and phase velocity u=2.96e7 m/s.

Now part (b), phase velocity. Phase velocity v_p is 1 / sqrt( LC ), but wait, in a lossy line, it's more complicated. Wait, no—the phase velocity is ω / β, where β is the phase constant. For a lossy line, the phase velocity is given by v_p = ω / (α imaginary part?), no, wait, the general formula for phase velocity is ω divided by the imaginary part of the propagation constant γ. Oh wait, γ is α + jβ, so the phase velocity is ω/β. But I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, in a lossless line, v_p is 1/sqrt(LC). But in this case, we have losses, so it's more complicated.

Hmm. Alternatively, the phase velocity can be found as v_p = ω / (sqrt( (GL - (ω^2 LC)) ) ), but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps using the relation for wave speed in a transmission line considering losses. Alternatively, the phase velocity can be approximated for low loss lines. But perhaps a better approach is to use the formula for phase velocity when the line is not lossless.

Wait, the general expression for phase velocity is:

v_p = ω / β,

where β is the imaginary part of the propagation constant γ. The propagation constant γ is sqrt( (R + jωL)(G + jωC) ). So γ = sqrt( (R + jωL)(G + jωC) ) ). So β is the imaginary part of γ.

Alternatively, phase velocity can be expressed as v_p = (ω * λ) , but λ is wavelength, which is 2π/β.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute the phase velocity using the expression:

v_p = 1 / sqrt( (L (G^2 + (ω C)^2 ) + ... ) Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it.

Wait, from the characteristic impedance, Z0, and the propagation constant γ, the phase velocity is v_p= ω / β, and β is the imaginary part of γ.

Alternatively, I remember that in the lossless case, v_p = 1/sqrt(LC). But with losses, it's different.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the propagation constant γ first. γ is sqrt( (R + jωL)(G + jωC) ).

Wait, but I've already computed (R + jωL)/(G + jωC) when finding Z0. Let me think.

Wait, in part (a), I found Z0 as sqrt( (R + jωL)/(G + jωC) ) ≈ 37.5 Ohms at -20 degrees.

Wait, but the product (R + jωL)(G + jωC) would be (0.01 + j0.01)(1e-6 + j1e-5) = Let's compute this.

Multiply (0.01)(1e-6) = 1e-8.

(0.01)(j1e-5)= j1e-7.

(j0.01)(1e-6) = j1e-8.

(j0.01)(j1e-5) = j^2 (1e-7) = -1e-7.

So adding all terms:

Real parts: 1e-8 -1e-7 = -9e-8.

Imaginary parts: 1e-7 +1e-8 = 1.1e-7.

So (R + jωL)(G + jωC) = (-9e-8) + j1.1e-7.

The magnitude is sqrt( (9e-8)^2 + (1.1e-7)^2 ) = sqrt(8.1e-15 + 1.21e-14 ) = sqrt(1.01e-14 )= approx 1e-7.

So γ is sqrt( (-9e-8 + j1.1e-7) ). Let me compute this square root.

Expressed in polar form: the complex number is -9e-8 +j1.1e-7. The magnitude is sqrt( (9e-8)^2 + (1.1e-7)^2 )= sqrt(8.1e-15 + 1.21e-14 )= sqrt(1.2901e-14 )= approx 1.136e-7.

The angle θ is arctan( (1.1e-7)/(-9e-8) )= arctan( -1.1/0.9 )= arctan(-1.222)≈ -50.7 degrees. But since the real part is negative and imaginary positive, it's in the second quadrant. So theta is 180 -50.7=129.3 degrees.

So sqrt( complex number ) would have magnitude sqrt(1.136e-7 )= approx 1.066e-3.5? Wait, sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5, but the exact value is sqrt(1.136e-7)= approx 1.066e-3.5? Wait, 1e-7 is (1e-3.5)^2, so sqrt(1e-7)=1e-3.5= about 3.16e-4. So 1.136e-7's square root is approx 1.066e-4.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it properly. The magnitude is sqrt(1.136e-7 )= let's compute 1.136e-7 = 1.136 * 1e-7.

Square root of 1.136 is approx 1.066. So sqrt(1.136e-7 )= 1.066e-3.5 ≈ 1.066e-3.5? Wait, 1e-7 is (1e-3.5)^2 so 1e-3.5 is 3.16e-4, so 1.066e-3.5 would be 1.066 *3.16e-4 ≈ 3.37e-4.

The angle for the square root would be half of 129.3, so about 64.65 degrees. So γ is approximately 3.37e-4 e^{j64.65°}.

So the propagation constant γ has real part (attenuation) and imaginary part (phase). The phase constant β is the imaginary part of γ. So β= 3.37e-4 * sin(64.65° ). Sin(60)= ~0.866, 65 is about 0.906. So 3.37e-4 * 0.906 ≈ 3.06e-4 rad/m.

Wait, no, wait. The phase velocity v_p is ω / β. So ω is 1e4 rad/s.

So v_p= 1e4 / (3.06e-4) )= approx 1e4
