Okay, so I've got this math problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says again: When a certain number is divided by 4, the answer is 160 with a remainder of 2. I need to find that number from the given options.

Hmm, right. So division with remainder. I remember that when you divide a number by another, you get a quotient and a remainder. The formula I think is something like: dividend equals divisor multiplied by quotient plus the remainder. Yeah, that sounds right.

So in this case, the divisor is 4, the quotient is 160, and the remainder is 2. So the number we're looking for is 4 times 160 plus 2. Let me calculate that.

4 times 160... let's see, 4 times 100 is 400, and 4 times 60 is 240. So adding those together, 400 + 240 is 640. Then add the remainder, which is 2, so 640 + 2 equals 642.

Wait, but let me double-check that because sometimes I get mixed up with the multiplication. Maybe I should do it another way. 160 divided by 4 is 40, but wait, no, that's not relevant here. Or wait, no, actually, in this problem, 4 is the divisor, so 4 times 160 is definitely 640. Adding 2 gives 642.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one is 642. Let's check the options:

A: 638
B: 602
C: 38
D: 632
E: 646
F: 660
G: 642
H: 42
I: 652
J: 640

Oh, option G is 642. So that must be the correct answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Sometimes I might add wrong or multiply wrong. Let me calculate 4*160 again. 160*4: 100*4=400, 60*4=240; 400+240=640. Add 2 gives 642. Yep, that's correct. So the number is 642, which is option G.

The problem involves finding a number that, when divided by 4, gives a quotient of 160 and a remainder of 2. Using the formula for division: 

\[
\text{Number} = (\text{Divisor} \times \text{Quotient}) + \text{Remainder}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{Number} = (4 \times 160) + 2 = 640 + 2 = 642
\]

From the options provided, the correct answer is **G: 642**.
