Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"The greatest contribution that Africa can make to the peace of the world is to avoid all the dangers inherent in disunity, by creating a political union which will also by its success, stand as an example to a divided world. A Union of African states will project more effectively the African personality. It will command respect from a world that has regard only for size and influence. The scant attention paid to African opposition to the French atomic tests in the Sahara, and the ignominious spectacle of the U.N. in the Congo quibbling about constitutional niceties while the Republic was tottering into anarchy, are evidence of the callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers."
Kwame Nkrumah, Ghanian leader, 1961
Which of the following explains why Nkrumah feels Africa must "avoid all the dangers inherent in disunity"?

Options:

A: Disunity might lead to the failure of political unions within the African continent.
B: African nations will not achieve independence without unity.
C: Disunity is what originally led many African nations into disarray.
D: The world community sees power as a function of size and influence.
E: The African continent has already experienced its share of civil wars.

Okay, so I have this question about Kwame Nkrumah's quote from 1961. I need to figure out why he thinks Africa must avoid disunity. Let me read the passage again to understand the context.

He says that the greatest contribution Africa can make to world peace is to avoid dangers from disunity by creating a political union. This union would serve as an example to a divided world. He mentions that a united Africa would project the African personality better and command respect because the world respects size and influence. He gives examples like the French atomic tests in Sahara and the UN's handling of the Congo situation, which show that African independence isn't taken seriously by the Great Powers.

So, the question is asking why Nkrumah feels Africa must avoid disunity. The options are A to E, and I need to pick the correct one.

Let me look at each option:

Option A: Disunity might lead to the failure of political unions within Africa. Hmm, that sounds a bit circular. The failure of unions is a possible effect, but is that why he's saying they must avoid disunity?

Option B: African nations won't achieve independence without unity. Wait, the quote is from 1961, and many African countries were already gaining independence around that time. So maybe this isn't the main point here.

Option C: Disunity led many African nations into disarray. The quote doesn't explicitly say that disunity caused past problems, but more about the current and future dangers.

Option D: The world community sees power as a function of size and influence. This directly relates to what Nkrumah said. He mentions that the world respects size and influence, so without unity, Africa isn't taken seriously.

Option E: Africa has had civil wars because of disunity. The passage doesn't mention civil wars specifically, so this might not be the right reason.

So putting it together, the key point is that the world respects size and influence. If Africa is disunited, each country is small and lacks influence, so they're ignored, as seen in the examples he gave. Therefore, avoiding disunity would make Africa a stronger, more respected entity on the world stage.

So the correct answer should be D.

The correct answer is D because Nkrumah emphasizes that the world respects size and influence. African disunity leads to a lack of both, making the continent's nations less influential and less respected globally.
