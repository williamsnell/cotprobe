Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about fallacies. The question is asking about a specific type of fallacy where someone determines the conclusion they want first and then only accepts evidence that supports it, or interprets all evidence as backing that conclusion. I need to figure out which option correctly names this fallacy.

First, I'll recall what I know about common logical fallacies. One that comes to mind is "confirmation bias," but I don't think that's one of the options here. Wait, the question is probably referring to a Latin term since some of the options are in Latin.

Looking at the options:

A: ad ignorantium – I think that's the appeal to ignorance fallacy, where someone argues that because something isn't proven, it's either true or false. So that's probably not it.

B: a priori – This is a term from philosophy meaning "from the beginning" or knowledge independent of experience. It's not a fallacy but more of a type of reasoning or knowledge. So B doesn't seem right.

C: plurium interrogationum – I'm not too familiar with this one. Breaking it down, "plurium" means "of many" and "interrogationum" relates to questions. Oh wait, I think this is the fallacy of many questions, where a question assumes multiple things that haven't been proven. But the question here is about selecting evidence to fit a conclusion, so maybe not.

D: Extension – Hmm, not sure. I don't recall an "extension" fallacy. Maybe it's related to generalization, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: the fallacy described sounds like "confirmation bias," but in terms of logical fallacies, it's sometimes referred to as "selective evidence presentation" or "cherry-picking." But none of the options match that.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the terms. The process described is where someone starts with a conclusion and then seeks only supporting evidence, ignoring contradictory evidence. Isn't that called "a priori" reasoning? No, a priori is about knowledge not based on experience. Or perhaps it's the "appeal to ignorance," but that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: "begging the question." That's when the conclusion is assumed in the premise. But that's not exactly what's described here. The scenario here is more about evidence selection.

Wait, maybe it's not one of the standard named fallacies. Let me think again. Oh, wait, perhaps it's the "confirmation bias fallacy." But that's not one of the options.

Looking back, the options given are A to D, and the choices are ad ignorantium, a priori, plurium interrogationum, and extension.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options. Let me think again about each option:

A: ad ignorantium – Appeal to ignorance. If someone argues that a claim is true because it hasn't been proven false, that's this fallacy. Doesn't fit here.

B: a priori – As I thought earlier, not a fallacy but a type of reasoning.

C: plurium interrogationum – Fallacy of many questions. This occurs when a question is asked that makes multiple assumptions that haven't been established. For example, "When did you stop beating your wife?" assumes that you used to beat your wife. So this doesn't match the scenario described.

D: Extension – I'm not sure. Maybe it's a distractor.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing another fallacy. The scenario describes someone who decides on a conclusion first and then only accepts evidence that supports it. That sounds like "confirmation bias," but in formal fallacy terms, I think it's called "selective evidence fallacy" or "cherry-picking." But none of the options here match that.

Alternatively, maybe it's the "a priori" fallacy, but I don't think a priori is considered a fallacy. It's more of a method of reasoning.

Wait, another thought: the fallacy might be called "argumentum ad Ignoram," but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps it's "circulus in probando," but that's circular reasoning, which is different.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. Let me re-read the question.

The question states: the fallacy where you determine the conclusion first and then accept only supporting evidence or interpret all evidence to support it.

Wait, I think this is called the "confirmation bias fallacy," but the term in Latin might be something else. Oh wait, I think the correct term is "a priori," but no, that's not exactly it.

Wait, another angle: the fallacy where someone starts with a conclusion and works backward is sometimes called "assuming the conclusion" or "petitio principii," which is the Latin term for begging the question. But that's when the premise includes the conclusion, not necessarily about evidence selection.

Wait, perhaps the answer is B: a priori. Because a priori reasoning is independent of experience and can involve reaching conclusions without evidence, but I'm not sure that's the exact fallacy described.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C: plurium interrogationum, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think differently. The question describes a scenario where the conclusion is determined first, and evidence is selected to fit. This is the definition of confirmation bias, but in logical fallacies, I think it's called "selective evidence" or "cherry-picking." However, none of the options here directly state that.

Wait, perhaps the term is "a priori" in a different sense. For example, if someone decides on a conclusion a priori (before considering evidence), then they might only accept evidence that fits. So maybe B is the answer.

Alternatively, I might be confusing the terms. Another possibility is that the fallacy is called "argumentum a priori," but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A: ad ignorantium. No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me try to think of the options again.

The options are:

A: ad ignorantium – Appeal to ignorance.

B: a priori – Not a fallacy.

C: plurium interrogationum – Fallacy of many questions.

D: Extension – Not familiar.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B: a priori. Because if someone decides a priori, they might ignore evidence.

Alternatively, perhaps it's none of these. But that's unlikely.

Wait, another thought: the fallacy where you interpret all evidence to support your conclusion is called "the Texas sharpshooter fallacy," but that's not listed.

Alternatively, perhaps it's "affirming the consequent," but that's a different logical error.

Wait, maybe I should look up the options to see which one matches.

Wait, the question is in the style of a philosophy exam, so perhaps the correct term is "a priori." But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C: plurium interrogationum. But no, that's about multiple questions in one.

Wait, I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the definition again: determining the conclusion first and then accepting only supporting evidence. That's confirmation bias, but in formal terms, it's called "selective evidence" or "cherry-picking." None of the options match, but perhaps the closest is B: a priori.

Wait, another approach: the fallacy is called "a priori knowledge" when you have knowledge independent of experience. But the process described is about reasoning, not knowledge.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B: a priori, because it's about reasoning from a predetermined conclusion without evidence.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C: plurium interrogationum, but that doesn't fit.

I think I'm stuck, but I'll have to make a choice based on what I know. The fallacy described sounds most like confirmation bias, but since that's not an option, I have to choose from the given ones. None of the options directly match, but perhaps B: a priori is the intended answer because it involves reasoning from a preconceived conclusion.

Wait, no, a priori is more about the type of reasoning (independent of experience) rather than the fallacy of selecting evidence. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is A: ad ignorantium, but that doesn't fit either.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the terms. Let me think of another angle: the fallacy is sometimes called "the fallacy of circular reasoning," but that's when the premise and conclusion are the same.

Wait, I think I'm going to have to make a guess here. Based on the description, the fallacy is about selecting evidence to fit a preconceived conclusion, which is confirmation bias. Since that's not an option, I might have to reconsider.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C: plurium interrogationum. No, that's about multiple questions. So I'm back to square one.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. The correct answer is B: a priori. Because a priori reasoning starts with a conclusion and works backward, ignoring evidence.

Wait, no, a priori isn't a fallacy. It's a type of reasoning. But perhaps in this context, the question is referring to it as a fallacy. So I think the intended answer is B.

Wait, no, I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is A: ad ignorantium.

Wait, I'm really stuck. Let me try to think of the options again.

The fallacy is about accepting only evidence that supports a preconceived conclusion. This is confirmation bias. But the options don't include that. So perhaps the answer is B: a priori.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C: plurium interrogationum, but I don't think so.

Wait, another thought: the fallacy where someone assumes the conclusion and then argues in a way that supports it is called "petitio principii" or "begging the question." But that's not one of the options either.

Wait, perhaps the answer is D: Extension. But I'm not familiar with that term in this context.

I'm really not sure, but I think the closest is B: a priori. So I'll go with B.

The question asks about a fallacy where the conclusion is determined first, and only evidence supporting it is accepted or interpreted to fit it. This description aligns with confirmation bias, but since that term is not an option, the analysis turns to the provided choices:

- **A: ad ignorantium** refers to the appeal to ignorance fallacy, where a claim is accepted as true because it hasn't been proven false. This doesn't match the scenario.
- **B: a priori** involves knowledge or reasoning independent of experience. While it isn't typically a fallacy, it could describe reasoning that starts with a preconceived conclusion and ignores evidence, which somewhat fits the description.
- **C: plurium interrogationum** refers to the fallacy of many questions, where a question assumes multiple unproven premises. This doesn't align with the scenario.
- **D: Extension** isn't a recognized fallacy and doesn't fit the description.

Given the options, **B: a priori** is the closest match, as it can describe reasoning that begins with a predetermined conclusion and ignores evidence. While not a perfect fit, it aligns more closely than the other choices.

Answer: B
