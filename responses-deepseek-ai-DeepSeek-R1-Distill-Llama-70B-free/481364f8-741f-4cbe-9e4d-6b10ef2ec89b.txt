Okay, so I've got this problem about tire pressure and volume. Let me try to wrap my head around it. Hmm, the question says that an automobile tire has a volume of 1500 cubic inches. The current pressure is 20.0 lb per square inch, and we need to find out how much air at standard pressure must be added to bring it up to 35.0 lb per square inch. 

Wait, standard pressure—oh right, I think that's usually around 14.7 psi, but wait, does that matter here? Because the problem says the air is at standard pressure when it's being forced in. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the tire's initial pressure is 20 psi, and the air we're adding is at some standard condition, but no, wait, perhaps I should think in terms of ideal gas law.

So the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. But maybe we can use it in a simpler way since we're dealing with pressure and volume changes. Wait, but the volume of the tire itself doesn't change, right? Because the tire's volume is given as 1500 in³. So we're adding air into this fixed volume to increase the pressure.

Wait, but how does that work? Let me think. So initially, the tire has some amount of air at 20 psi. Then we add more air (at standard pressure, which I think is 14.7 psi, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here) until the pressure goes up to 35 psi. So the question is, how much volume of air at standard pressure is needed to be added to achieve this.

Wait, wait a minute. Let's clarify. The initial state is the tire at 20 psi with volume 1500 in³. The final state is the same tire at 35 psi, so same volume, but more air. So the problem is about the additional air that needs to be pumped in.

But wait, the air being forced in is at standard pressure. So perhaps the air we're adding is measured at standard pressure (like atmospheric pressure) and then when it's inside the tire, it's compressed to a higher pressure. So we need to find the volume of this additional air as it would be at standard pressure before being compressed into the tire.

Wait, that makes sense. So the process is: take some amount of air at standard pressure (say, 14.7 psi) and push it into the tire, which is at a higher pressure. So the added air is compressed into the tire's volume, contributing to the increase in pressure.

So, maybe we can model this using the ideal gas law, assuming temperature is constant. Because if the temperature doesn't change, then PV is proportional to n. So perhaps we can set up a ratio of initial and final states.

Wait, the initial state of the tire is P1 = 20 psi, V = 1500 in³. The final pressure is P2 = 35 psi. The number of moles initially is n1 = (P1 V)/(RT). After adding air, the total number of moles is n2 = (P2 V)/(RT). So the amount of air added is n2 - n1.

But the air we add is at standard pressure. Let me call that P0 = 14.7 psi. Wait, but wait—does the problem specify what standard pressure is? Hmm, the problem says "air (at standard pressure)" must be forced in. So perhaps the air is measured at standard pressure, which is 14.7 psi. So the volume of the added air, when it's at 14.7 psi, is what we're looking for.

Wait, let me try to model this. Let me denote:

- V_tire = 1500 in³ (volume of the tire)
- P_initial = 20 psi
- P_final = 35 psi
- P_standard = 14.7 psi (assuming standard atmospheric pressure)
- V_added_standard: the volume of air at standard pressure that needs to be added.

So the idea is that the added air, when compressed into the tire, increases the pressure from 20 to 35 psi. So the total number of moles in the tire after adding is n_final = (P_final * V_tire)/(R T). The initial moles were n_initial = (P_initial * V_tire)/(R T). So the moles added are delta_n = n_final - n_initial = (P_final - P_initial) * V_tire / (R T).

But the added moles come from the air at standard pressure, which is at P_standard. So the volume of that air at standard pressure would be V_added_standard = (delta_n * R T) / P_standard.

Wait, but since temperature is constant, R T is a constant, so maybe we can find the ratio without knowing R and T.

Alternatively, since the added air's volume at standard pressure is V_added_standard, when it's forced into the tire, it occupies a different volume, but the number of moles is the same. So the moles of added air is (P_standard * V_added_standard)/(R T).

Wait, maybe it's easier to think about the total moles before and after. So initially, the tire has n1 = (P_initial * V_tire) / (R T). After adding, the total moles are n2 = (P_final * V_tire) / (R T). So the added moles are delta_n = n2 - n1 = [ (P_final - P_initial) * V_tire ] / (R T ).

But the added moles delta_n must also equal the moles in the added air at standard pressure, which is (P_standard * V_added_standard) / (R T). So setting them equal:

delta_n = (P_standard * V_added_standard) / (R T )

Substituting delta_n from above:

[ (P_final - P_initial) * V_tire ] / (R T ) = (P_standard * V_added_standard) / (R T )

The R T terms cancel out, so:

(P_final - P_initial) * V_tire = P_standard * V_added_standard

So solving for V_added_standard:

V_added_standard = [ (P_final - P_initial) * V_tire ] / P_standard

Plugging in the numbers:

P_final = 35 psi
P_initial = 20 psi
V_tire = 1500 in³
P_standard = 14.7 psi

So V_added_standard = (35 - 20) * 1500 / 14.7

Calculating numerator: 15 * 1500 = 22500

Divide by 14.7: 22500 / 14.7 ≈ let's see.

14.7 times 1500 is 22050, which is a bit less than 22500. So 22500 / 14.7 = approximately 1529.59 in³. Wait, but wait, let me calculate that more accurately.

Wait, 14.7 * 1529 ≈ ?

Wait, 14.7 * 1500 = 22050.

14.7 * 29.59 ≈ let me compute 14.7 * 29 = 426.3 and 14.7 * 0.59 ≈ 8.673. So total ≈ 434.973.

So 22050 + 434.973 ≈ 22484.973, which is close to 22500, so 1529.59 in³ is approximately the value.

Wait, but the options don't have 1529. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: 450
B:600
C:2000
D:1050
E:1500
F:2500
G:300
H:750
I:1800
J:1200

Hmm, 1529 is closest to 1500, which is option E, but let me double-check my calculations. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait another thought: perhaps instead of considering the added air at standard pressure, the problem is treating the entire volume of air as being at standard pressure. But another approach could be using Boyle's Law, assuming temperature is constant.

Wait, Boyle's Law says P1 V1 = P2 V2, but that's for a fixed amount of gas. But in this case, we're adding more gas, so the amount isn't fixed, so Boyle's Law may not apply directly.

Wait, another approach: the initial pressure is 20 psi, and we need to reach 35 psi. The pressure increase is 15 psi. So perhaps the volume needed is (15/20) * 1500? Wait, that would be 1125 in³, but that's not an option either. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the ideal gas law. The number of moles in the tire before adding air is n1 = P1 V / (RT). After adding, it's n2 = P2 V / (RT). So the added moles are n2 - n1 = (P2 - P1) V / (RT).

But the added air comes from a source at standard pressure P0. The volume of that added air at P0 is V_add = n_added * RT / P0 = [ (P2 - P1) V / RT ) ] * (RT / P0 ) = (P2 - P1) V / P0.

So V_add = (35 - 20) * 1500 / 14.7

Which is the same as before: 15 * 1500 = 22500, divided by 14.7 gives approximately 1529.59 in³.

But the options don't have that. So maybe I'm making a mistake. Let me check if I've misunderstood the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the air being added is at atmospheric pressure, but when it's added into the tire, it's compressed into the tire's volume, so the amount of air to add is based on the difference in pressure relative to the tire's volume.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to consider the total pressure needed and how much volume needs to be added at standard pressure to achieve that.

Wait, maybe another approach: The total pressure after adding is 35 psi. The initial pressure is 20 psi. So the added pressure is 15 psi. But how does that relate to the volume of air added?

Wait, maybe the way to think about it is that the added air, when compressed into the tire, adds to the pressure. So the added air's contribution to the pressure is 15 psi. So if the volume of the tire is 1500 in³, then the volume of air needed at standard pressure (14.7 psi) would be such that when compressed into 1500 in³, it adds 15 psi.

So, using P1 V1 = P2 V2, where P1 is 14.7 psi, V1 is the volume we're looking for, P2 is 15 psi (the added pressure), and V2 is 1500 in³.

Wait, that might make sense. So 14.7 * V1 = 15 * 1500.

Wait, that would give V1 = (15 * 1500) / 14.7 ≈ (22500) /14.7 ≈ 1529.59, same as before. But again, this isn't one of the options.

Wait, maybe the standard pressure isn't 14.7 psi? The problem says "standard pressure"—perhaps it's 0 psi gauge, meaning absolute pressure is 14.7 psi, but sometimes standard pressure is considered as 14.7 psi absolute. Alternatively, maybe the problem is assuming standard pressure is 15 psi? No, that doesn't make much sense.

Wait the problem says "air (at standard pressure) must be forced in." So perhaps the pressure of the air being added is at standard atmospheric pressure, but maybe the tire's initial pressure is gauge pressure, not absolute. Oh! That could change things.

Wait, in the real world, tire pressure is usually measured as gauge pressure, which is pressure above atmospheric. So if the initial tire pressure is 20 psi gauge, then the absolute pressure is 20 + 14.7 = 34.7 psi. Similarly, the desired final pressure is 35 psi gauge, so absolute is 35 + 14.7 = 49.7 psi.

Wait, that's a different approach. Let me think again.

So, if the initial absolute pressure P1 is 20 + 14.7 = 34.7 psi.

The final absolute pressure P2 is 35 + 14.7 = 49.7 psi.

So, the initial moles in the tire: n1 = P1 V / RT.

The final moles: n2 = P2 V / RT.

So delta_n = n2 - n1 = (P2 - P1) V / RT.

The added air comes from standard pressure, which is 14.7 psi absolute. So the volume of this added air at standard pressure is V_added = delta_n * RT / P_standard.

So V_added = (P2 - P1) V / P_standard.

Plugging in the numbers:

P2 = 49.7 psi
P1 = 34.7 psi
V = 1500 in³
P_standard = 14.7 psi

So P2 - P1 = 15 psi.

So V_added = (15 * 1500) / 14.7 = 22500 / 14.7 ≈ 1529.59 in³.

Again, same result, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the volume of air needed at standard pressure to raise the pressure in the tire by 15 psi (from 20 to 35). So perhaps the formula is V_add = (P_increase * V_tire) / P_standard.

Which would be (15 * 1500) / 14.7 ≈ 1529.59, same as before. But no option matches.

Looking back at the options, the closest is option E: 1500. But perhaps the problem is approximating 14.7 as 15, which would make the calculation 22500 /15=1500 exactly. So maybe that's it.

If that's the case, then V_added = (35-20)*1500/15 = 15*1500/15=1500 in³. So the answer would be E:1500.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the initial pressure is 20 psi absolute and the final is 35 psi absolute, with standard pressure being 14.7 psi. But that would change the numbers again.

Wait, let's try that approach. If the initial pressure is 20 psi absolute, final is 35 psi absolute.

Then delta_P = 15 psi.

V_added = (15 * 1500)/14.7 ≈ 1529.59. Still same issue.

But maybe the problem is not accounting for absolute pressure, treating everything as gauge pressure. So initial P is 20 psi, final 35 psi, so delta P is 15 psi.

Then V_added = (15 * 1500)/P_standard.

If P_standard is 14.7, it's 1529.59, but if the problem assumes P_standard is 15 psi, then it's exactly 1500. So perhaps that's the intended approach.

In that case, the answer would be E:1500 in³.

Looking back at the options, E is 1500, which matches this approximation.
</think>

To determine how much air at standard pressure (14.7 psi) must be forced into the tire to increase its pressure from 20.0 psi to 35.0 psi, we can use the ideal gas law and the relationship between pressure, volume, and the number of moles of air. The tire's volume is fixed at 1500 in³, and the problem assumes temperature is constant.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial and Final States**:
   - Initial pressure: \( P_{\text{initial}} = 20.0 \, \text{psi} \)
   - Final pressure: \( P_{\text{final}} = 35.0 \, \text{psi} \)
   - Volume of the tire: \( V_{\text{tire}} = 1500 \, \text{in}^3 \)
   - Standard pressure: \( P_{\text{standard}} = 14.7 \, \text{psi} \)

2. **Pressure Increase**:
   The pressure increase required is:
   \[
   \Delta P = P_{\text{final}} - P_{\text{initial}} = 35.0 - 20.0 = 15.0 \, \text{psi}
   \]

3. **Volume of Air to be Added**:
   The volume of air at standard pressure that must be added to achieve this pressure increase can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   V_{\text{added}} = \frac{\Delta P \cdot V_{\text{tire}}}{P_{\text{standard}}}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   V_{\text{added}} = \frac{15.0 \cdot 1500}{14.7} \approx 1529.59 \, \text{in}^3
   \]

4. **Approximation**:
   The calculated value of \( V_{\text{added}} \) is approximately \( 1529.59 \, \text{in}^3 \). However, none of the provided options match this exact value. The closest option is **1500 in³**, which likely assumes a simplified calculation where \( P_{\text{standard}} \) is approximated as \( 15.0 \, \text{psi} \) instead of \( 14.7 \, \text{psi} \). Using \( P_{\text{standard}} = 15.0 \, \text{psi} \), the calculation becomes:
   \[
   V_{\text{added}} = \frac{15.0 \cdot 1500}{15.0} = 1500 \, \text{in}^3
   \]

### Conclusion:
The problem likely assumes \( P_{\text{standard}} = 15.0 \, \text{psi} \) for simplicity, leading to \( V_{\text{added}} = 1500 \, \text{in}^3 \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**E: 1500 in³**
