Okay, so I've got this problem here about a model rocket's trajectory, and I'm supposed to find its maximum height. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

The trajectory is given by the function c(t) = (80t, 200t - 4.9t²). I remember that in kinematics, the trajectory of a projectile under gravity can be described by parametric equations. The first part, 80t, is the horizontal position, and the second part, 200t - 4.9t², is the vertical position as a function of time t.

The question is about maximum height, so I'm focusing on the vertical component, which is 200t - 4.9t². I think maximum height occurs when the vertical velocity becomes zero because that's the peak before the rocket starts falling back down.

Wait, velocity is the derivative of the position with respect to time. So I should find the derivative of the vertical position function. Let me do that. The derivative of 200t is 200, and the derivative of -4.9t² is -9.8t. So the vertical velocity is v(t) = 200 - 9.8t.

To find when the velocity is zero, I set v(t) = 0: 200 - 9.8t = 0. Solving for t gives t = 200 / 9.8. Let me compute that. 200 divided by 9.8. Hmm, 9.8 times 20 is 196, so 20 seconds would give 196. 200-196 is 4, so 4/9.8 is about 0.408. So t ≈ 20.408 seconds.

Wait, no, wait. Let me calculate that more accurately. 200 divided by 9.8. 9.8 times 20 is 196, subtract 196 from 200, you get 4. So 4 / 9.8 = 0.408... So t is 20.408... seconds.

Now that I have the time when the rocket is at maximum height, I need to plug this back into the vertical position equation to find the height at that time.

So the vertical position is s(t) = 200t - 4.9t². Plugging in t ≈ 20.408.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula to avoid plugging in the time. Oh wait, there's a formula for maximum height in projectile motion. The maximum height H can be found by H = (v₀²) / (2g), where v₀ is the initial vertical velocity.

Wait, let's see. The initial vertical velocity here is 200 m/s, right? Because when t=0, the velocity is 200 m/s upwards. So plugging that into the formula, H = (200)^2 / (2 * 9.8).

Calculating that: 200 squared is 40,000. Divided by (2*9.8)=19.6. So 40000 / 19.6. Let me compute that.

Well, 19.6 times 2000 is 39,200. Because 19.6 * 2000 = 39,200. Then, 40,000 minus 39,200 is 800. Now, 800 / 19.6 is approximately 40.816... So H ≈ 2040.816... meters. So approximately 2041 meters.

Looking at the options, option C is 2041. That must be the correct answer.

Wait, just to make sure, I'll try plugging the time into the original equation. So t is about 20.408. Let me compute s(t) = 200*(20.408) -4.9*(20.408)^2.

First, 200 * 20.408 = 4081.6 meters.

Now, (20.408)^2. Let me compute that. 20 squared is 400, 0.408 squared is about 0.166, and the cross term is 2*20*0.408=16.32. So 400 + 16.32 + 0.166 ≈ 416.486.

So 20.408 squared is approximately 416.486.

Now, 4.9 * 416.486 is about 4.9 * 400 = 1960, 4.9*16.486 ≈ 80.6574. So total is approximately 2040.6574.

So s(t) = 4081.6 - 2040.6574 ≈ 2040.94 meters, which is approximately 2041. So yes, option C is correct.

To determine the rocket's maximum height, we analyze the vertical component of its trajectory, given by \( s(t) = 200t - 4.9t^2 \). The maximum height occurs when the vertical velocity becomes zero. The vertical velocity is the derivative of \( s(t) \), which is \( v(t) = 200 - 9.8t \). Setting \( v(t) = 0 \), we solve for \( t \):

\[
200 - 9.8t = 0 \implies t = \frac{200}{9.8} \approx 20.408 \, \text{seconds}.
\]

At this time, the rocket reaches its maximum height. To find the maximum height, we substitute \( t \approx 20.408 \) into \( s(t) \):

\[
s(t) = 200t - 4.9t^2.
\]

First, calculate \( t^2 \):

\[
t^2 \approx (20.408)^2 \approx 416.486.
\]

Now substitute into \( s(t) \):

\[
s(t) = 200(20.408) - 4.9(416.486).
\]

Compute each term:

\[
200(20.408) \approx 4081.6, \quad 4.9(416.486) \approx 2040.657.
\]

Thus:

\[
s(t) \approx 4081.6 - 2040.657 \approx 2040.94 \, \text{meters}.
\]

This result is consistent with the formula for maximum height in projectile motion, \( H = \frac{v_0^2}{2g} \), where \( v_0 = 200 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \):

\[
H = \frac{200^2}{2(9.8)} = \frac{40000}{19.6} \approx 2040.816 \, \text{meters}.
\]

Both methods confirm that the maximum height is approximately \( 2041 \, \text{meters} \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: 2041**
