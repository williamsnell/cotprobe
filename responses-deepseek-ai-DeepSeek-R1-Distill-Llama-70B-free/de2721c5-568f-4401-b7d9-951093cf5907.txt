Okay, so I've got this multiple choice question here about sequences and limits. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, let's look at Statement 1. It says that if we have two sequences of complex numbers, {s_n} and {t_n}, and they both converge to s and t respectively, then the limit of their product s_n t_n should be st. Hmm, I remember from my analysis class that when dealing with limits of products, if both limits exist, then the limit of the product is the product of the limits. So that should be true. But wait, are there any conditions where this might not hold? Like, maybe if the limits aren't finite? But the statement specifies complex numbers, which include real numbers as a subset, so I think it's safe. So Statement 1 should be true.

Now, moving on to Statement 2. It says there exists a bounded sequence of real numbers with no convergent subsequence. Wait, I thought that every bounded sequence in real numbers has a convergent subsequence. Oh right, that's the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem! So if a sequence is bounded and in the real numbers, it must have a convergent subsequence. So Statement 2 must be false because such a sequence can't exist.

Putting it together: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false. Now looking at the options, option A is "True, False", which matches my analysis. So the correct answer should be A.

The correct answer is determined by evaluating the two statements:

1. **Statement 1**: If two sequences of complex numbers {s_n} and {t_n} converge to s and t respectively, then the product sequence s_n t_n converges to st. This is true because the limit of a product of convergent sequences is the product of their limits.

2. **Statement 2**: There exists a bounded sequence of real numbers with no convergent subsequence. This is false due to the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, which states that every bounded sequence of real numbers has a convergent subsequence.

Thus, Statement 1 is true, and Statement 2 is false. The correct option is **A**.
