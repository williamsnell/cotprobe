Okay, so I have this problem here about inductive reactance, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me remember what I learned. Inductive reactance is the resistance that a coil (inductor) presents to an alternating current (AC) circuit. I think the formula for inductive reactance is X_L equals 2π times the frequency times the inductance. Wait, or was it X_L equals 2πfL? Yeah, that sounds right.

The problem says the inductance is 20 millihenries. Oh wait, millihenries is 1e-3 henries. So 20 mH is 0.02 henries. And the frequency is 60 cycles, which I think is 60 Hz, right? So f is 60.

Putting it into the formula: X_L = 2 * π * 60 * 0.02. Let me calculate that step by step. First, 2 times π is about 6.283. Then multiply by 60, so 6.283 * 60 is approximately 376.98. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 6.283 * 60 is 376.98? Let me double-check that. Oh, wait, 6 times 60 is 360, and 0.283 times 60 is about 16.98, so together that's 376.98. Then multiply that by 0.02? Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the formula is 2πfL. So f is 60, L is 0.02.

Wait, maybe I should compute it in a different order. Let's see: 60 Hz times 0.02 H. 60 * 0.02 is 1.2. Then multiply that by 2π. So 2π is about 6.283. So 1.2 * 6.283 is... Let me compute that. 1 times 6.283 is 6.283, 0.2 times 6.283 is about 1.2566. So adding them together, 6.283 + 1.2566 is approximately 7.5396 ohms. That's around 7.54 ohms.

Looking at the choices, option B is 7.5 ohms. That's the closest. So the answer should be B.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a calculation mistake. Maybe I should do it again. So 2π * 60 * 0.02. Let me compute 2π first. So 2 * 3.1416 is 6.2832. Multiply by 60 gives 6.2832 * 60. Let's do 6*60 is 360, 0.2832*60 is 16.992. So 360 + 16.992 is 376.992. Now multiply that by 0.02 H. 376.992 * 0.02 is... 376.992 divided by 50, because 0.02 is 1/50. 376.992 divided by 50, let's see. 50 times 7 is 350, so subtract 350 from 376.992 gives 26.992. 50 goes into 26.992 about 0.539 times. So total is 7.53984 ohms. So yeah, approximately 7.54. So the closest option is B:7.5 ohms.

To calculate the inductive reactance \( X_L \) of the coil, we use the formula:

\[
X_L = 2 \pi f L
\]

Where:
- \( f = 60 \, \text{Hz} \) (the frequency of the AC source),
- \( L = 20 \, \text{mH} = 0.02 \, \text{H} \) (the inductance of the coil).

Substituting the values:

\[
X_L = 2 \pi (60)(0.02)
\]

First, calculate \( 2 \pi \):
\[
2 \pi \approx 6.2832
\]

Then multiply by \( f \):
\[
6.2832 \times 60 = 376.992
\]

Finally, multiply by \( L \):
\[
376.992 \times 0.02 = 7.53984 \, \Omega
\]

The closest option to \( 7.53984 \, \Omega \) is \( 7.5 \, \Omega \), which corresponds to option **B**.
