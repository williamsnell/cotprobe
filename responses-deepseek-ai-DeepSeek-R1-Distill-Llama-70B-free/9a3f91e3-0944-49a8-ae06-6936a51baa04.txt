Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Earth's rotation and objects becoming weightless. Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step.

The question is: What would be the period of rotation of the Earth about its axis if its rotation speed increased until an object at the equator became weightless? The options are from A to J.

Alright, so I remember that when something is weightless, it's essentially in free fall. Like, when you're in an elevator that's dropping, you feel weightless for a moment. So in this case, the Earth's rotation is causing the object at the equator to feel weightless. That must mean that the centripetal force required to keep the object moving in a circular path (which is the Earth's rotation) is equal to the gravitational force pulling it towards the center. Because if the required centripetal force exceeds gravity, the object would fly off, right?

Wait, no. Wait, when the object is weightless, the normal force (which is what we feel as weight) becomes zero. So the gravitational force must be providing the necessary centripetal force. Oh, right! Because normally, the weight (mg) is balanced by the normal force (N) from the ground. But when the object is in free fall, N becomes zero, so mg equals the centripetal force needed for circular motion.

So the equation would be: mg = (m v²)/r.

Wait, but let me get that right. The gravitational force on the object is F_gravity = G * (M * m) / r², where M is Earth's mass, m is the object's mass, r is Earth's radius, and G is the gravitational constant.

The centripetal force needed is F_centripetal = m * v² / r.

So when the object is weightless, the gravitational force provides the centripetal force. So:

G * (M * m) / r² = m * v² / r.

Oh, I can cancel out the m on both sides, so that leaves G*M / r² = v² / r.

Multiplying both sides by r: G*M / r = v².

So v² = G*M / r → v = sqrt(G*M / r).

Wait, but what's v in terms of Earth's rotation? Oh right, v is the tangential velocity at the equator, which is equal to 2πr / T, where T is the rotational period (the time for one full rotation).

So substituting v:

(2πr / T)^2 = G M / r.

Expanding that:

4 π² r² / T² = G M / r.

Multiply both sides by T² and divide by (4 π² r²):

1 = (G M T²) / (4 π² r^3).

Wait, no, let's rearrange:

T² = (4 π² r^3) / (G M).

So T = sqrt( (4 π² r^3) / (G M) ) = 2 π sqrt( r³/(G M) )

Wait, but I remember that the current orbital period of the Earth around the Sun is such that the formula T² = (4 π² r³)/(G M) holds, but in that case, M is the Sun's mass. Wait, no, wait: that's Kepler's third law, which for Earth's orbit, T is the orbital period around the Sun. But here, we're dealing with Earth's rotation, so the same formula applies but with different values.

Alternatively, I think I've heard that the Earth's rotational period when objects become weightless is related to the Earth's gravitational parameters.

Wait, but maybe I can approach this differently. The current rotational period of Earth is about 24 hours, but if it spins so fast that the centripetal acceleration equals g, then the period would be shorter. So I need to find T at which point the centripetal acceleration equals the gravitational acceleration on the surface.

The centripetal acceleration a is v²/r, which equals (4 π² r)/T². Because v = 2πr / T → v squared is 4 π² r² / T², so a = (4 π² r² / T²) / r = 4 π² r / T².

And the gravitational acceleration at the surface is g = G M / r².

So setting them equal: 4 π² r / T² = G M / r².

Multiply both sides by T²:

4 π² r = (G M / r²) T².

Then T² = (4 π² r^3) / (G M).

Wait, that's the same expression I had earlier. So T is the square root of (4 π² r^3 / (G M)).

But I can relate this to the current Earth's parameters. Let me think: do I know the current value of G*M for Earth? Or perhaps I can use the formula for the current gravitational acceleration.

Wait, on Earth's surface, g = G M / r² → G M = g r².

So substitute that into the T equation:

T² = (4 π² r^3) / (g r²) ) = (4 π² r) / g.

So T = sqrt( (4 π² r) / g ) = 2 π sqrt( r/(g) )

So T = 2 π sqrt(r/g).

Hmm, that's a manageable formula. Let's plug in the numbers.

What's the value of r (Earth's radius)? Approximately 6378 km, which is 6.378e6 meters.

g is approximately 9.8 m/s².

So let's compute sqrt(r/g):

r/g = 6.378e6 m / 9.8 m/s² = about 650,816.33 seconds.

Wait, no, wait: 6.378e6 / 9.8 ≈ Let me compute that.

6.378e6 / 9.8:

6e6 / 10 is 6e5, but 9.8 is 0.8 less than 10, so 6e6 /9.8 ≈ 612,244.9 seconds.

Wait, 6.378e6 /9.8 = 6.378e6 / 9.8 → 6.378e6 ÷ 9.8 ≈ 650,816.3265 seconds.

Wait no, 6.378e6 /9.8 = 6.378e6 ÷ 9.8 = 6.378e6 ÷ 9.8 ≈ 6.378e6 / 1e1 is 6.378e5, but since 9.8 is 0.2 less than 10, we can approximate with a slight increase. Let me compute exactly:

Compute 6,378,000 ÷ 9.8:

Well, 9.8 times 650,000 is 6,370,000. Because 650,000 *10=6,500,000, minus 650,000 *0.2=130,000 → 6,500,000 -130,000=6,370,000.

So 650,000 *9.8=6,370,000. But we have 6,378,000.

So the difference is 8,000. So 8,000 /9.8 ≈ 816.3267 seconds.

So total is 650,000 + 816.3267 ≈ 650,816.3267 seconds.

So sqrt(650,816.3267) → let's compute that.

What's the square root of 6.5e5?

Wait, sqrt(650,816.3267) is approximately 806.78 seconds.

Because 800² is 640,000. 806² is (800+6)² = 800² + 2*800*6 +6²=640,000+9,600+36=649,636. Hmm, but 649,636 is less than 650,816. Let's compute 806.78^2.

Wait, perhaps I can compute it more accurately.

We have:

806 *806 = ?

Compute 800²=640000, 2*800*6=9600, 6²=36. So 640000 +9600=649600 +36=649636.

But we have 650,816, which is 650,816 -649,636=1,180 more.

Each increment of x by 1 increases x² by approximately 2x +1.

At x=806, the next number would be 807: 806^2 =649,636.

807^2= (806+1)^2=806² + 2*806 +1=649636 +1612 +1=651,249.

Wait, but 651,249 is larger than 650,816. So the square root is between 806 and 807.

Compute 806.78^2:

Let me compute 806.78^2.

Well, (806 + 0.78)^2 = 806² + 2*806*0.78 + (0.78)^2.

Compute each term:

806² = 649,636.

2*806*0.78 = 1612 *0.78 = let's compute 1600*0.78=124.8, 12*0.78=9.36 → 124.8+9.36=134.16.

(0.78)^2=0.6084.

So total is 649,636 +134.16 +0.6084 = 649,636 +134.7684=649,770.7684.

But 649,770 is less than 650,816. So the actual sqrt is higher than 806.78.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on precise calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I can note that the actual value is approximately 806.78 seconds.

But wait, 806 seconds is 806/60 ≈ 13.433 minutes. Because a minute is 60 seconds.

Wait, but 806.78 seconds is about 13.44 minutes.

Wait, but that's sqrt(r/g) in seconds. So T is 2 π multiplied by that.

So T = 2 * π * 806.78 s ≈ 2 * 3.1416 * 806.78.

Compute 2 *3.1416≈6.2832.

6.2832 * 806.78 ≈ Let's compute 6 * 806.78 = 4,840.68, and 0.2832 *806.78 ≈ 228.5. So total is approximately 4,840.68 + 228.5 =5,069.18 seconds.

Wait, 5,069 seconds. Let's convert that into hours.

There are 3600 seconds in an hour. So 5,069 / 3600 ≈ 1.408 hours.

Which is approximately 1.41 hours. So the period T would be about 1.41 hours.

Looking at the options, option E is 1.41 hr.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a miscalculation. Let me double-check the steps.

We set the centripetal acceleration equal to g, which gives us the condition for weightlessness.

Centripetal acceleration a_c = v² / r = (4 π² r)/ T².

Set a_c = g → 4 π² r / T² = G M / r² → T² = (4 π² r^3)/(G M).

But using g = G M /r², so T² = (4 π² r^3) * (r²)/(g r^3)) )? Wait, no. Let me correct this.

Wait, T² = (4 π² r^3 )/(G M). And since G M = g r², substitute that in.

So T² = (4 π² r^3) / (g r²) ) → simplifies to (4 π² r )/g → T = sqrt( (4 π² r)/(g) ) → which is 2 π sqrt( r/(g) ).

Yes, that's correct.

So, plugging in r = 6.378e6 m, g=9.8 m/s².

r/g = 6.378e6 /9.8 ≈ 650,816 s².

Wait, no, wait: r is in meters, g in m/s², so r/g is in seconds squared? No, wait: r is meters, g is m/s², so r/g is (m) / (m/s²) )= s². So sqrt(r/g ) would be in seconds.

Wait, but in the formula, T is 2 π sqrt( r/(g) ), so the sqrt(r/g) is in seconds, and T would be in seconds as well.

Wait, earlier calculation said sqrt(r/g) is about 806.78 seconds.

So T = 2 * π * 806.78 ≈ 5,069 seconds.

Convert that to hours: 5,069 / 3600 ≈ 1.408 hours. So 1.41 hours, which matches option E.

So the correct answer should be E: 1.41 hr.

To determine the period of rotation of the Earth about its axis when an object at the equator becomes weightless, we analyze the condition where the centripetal force equals the gravitational force. 

When the object is weightless, the gravitational force provides the necessary centripetal force for circular motion. The equations are:

1. Gravitational force:  
   \[
   F_{\text{gravity}} = \frac{G M m}{r^2}
   \]

2. Centripetal force:  
   \[
   F_{\text{centripetal}} = \frac{m v^2}{r}
   \]

Equating the two forces:  
\[
\frac{G M m}{r^2} = \frac{m v^2}{r}
\]

Canceling \(m\) and simplifying:  
\[
\frac{G M}{r^2} = \frac{v^2}{r} \implies v^2 = \frac{G M}{r}
\]

The tangential velocity \(v\) at the equator is related to the rotational period \(T\) by:  
\[
v = \frac{2 \pi r}{T} \implies v^2 = \frac{4 \pi^2 r^2}{T^2}
\]

Substituting \(v^2 = \frac{G M}{r}\) into the equation for \(v^2\):  
\[
\frac{4 \pi^2 r^2}{T^2} = \frac{G M}{r}
\]

Rearranging for \(T^2\):  
\[
T^2 = \frac{4 \pi^2 r^3}{G M}
\]

Taking the square root:  
\[
T = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{r^3}{G M}}
\]

Using the relationship \(g = \frac{G M}{r^2}\), we substitute \(G M = g r^2\):  
\[
T = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{r}{g}}
\]

Substituting Earth's radius \(r = 6.378 \times 10^6 \, \text{m}\) and \(g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2\):  
\[
\frac{r}{g} = \frac{6.378 \times 10^6}{9.8} \approx 650,816 \, \text{s}^2
\]

Taking the square root:  
\[
\sqrt{\frac{r}{g}} \approx 806.78 \, \text{s}
\]

Thus:  
\[
T = 2 \pi \times 806.78 \approx 5,069 \, \text{s}
\]

Converting to hours:  
\[
T = \frac{5,069}{3,600} \approx 1.41 \, \text{hours}
\]

The period of rotation when an object at the equator becomes weightless is approximately **1.41 hours**. 

**Correct Answer: E**
