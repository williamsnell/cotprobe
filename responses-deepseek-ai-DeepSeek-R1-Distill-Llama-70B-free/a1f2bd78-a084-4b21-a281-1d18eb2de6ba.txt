Okay, so I've got this problem about an ideal gas and how its pressure changes when temperature and volume are adjusted. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my gas laws, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question says that the temperature is increased by a factor of 2 and the volume is increased by a factor of 8. I need to find out what happens to the pressure P.

I remember that the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. Since the problem doesn't mention the number of moles changing, I guess n is constant here, along with R being the gas constant. So the equation should help relate the changes in P, V, and T.

Wait, but since both T and V are changing, I need to see how these affect P. Let me think. Let's say initially the pressure is P1, volume V1, and temperature T1. After the changes, the pressure becomes P2, volume V2 = 8V1, and temperature T2 = 2T1.

Using the ideal gas law, for the initial state:
P1 * V1 = nRT1

And for the final state:
P2 * V2 = nRT2

Since n and R are constants, I can set the two equations equal to each other. So,

P1 * V1 = P2 * V2

Wait, no, because T is changing too. Let me correct that. The initial equation is P1 V1 = n R T1. The final equation is P2 V2 = n R T2. So I can write P1 V1 / (n R T1) = 1, same for the final state.

To find the ratio P2/P1, I can divide the two equations. Let me set them up:

(P2 V2) / (P1 V1) ) = (n R T2) / (n R T1)

The n R cancels out, so (P2 V2)/(P1 V1) ) = T2 / T1.

Wait, no, because both T and V are changing. Let me rearrange the equation correctly. Let's see:

From initial: P1 V1 = n R T1
From final: P2 V2 = n R T2

Divide final by initial:

(P2 V2) / (P1 V1) ) = T2 / T1

Yes, that makes sense because the n R terms cancel out.

So, P2 / P1 = (T2 / T1) * (V1 / V2)

Because when I rearrange the equation, P2 = (T2 V1) / (T1 V2) * P1.

Wait, let me make it clearer.

Let me rearrange (P2 V2)/(P1 V1) = T2/T1

So, P2 = (P1 V1 T2) / (V2 T1)

Yeah, that's right.

Now plug in the changes. T2 is 2*T1, so T2 = 2 T1. V2 is 8 V1, so V2 = 8 V1.

Substituting:

P2 = (P1 * V1 * 2 T1) / (8 V1 * T1)

Let's simplify this step by step.

First, V1 appears in numerator and denominator, so V1 cancels out.

Similarly, T1 cancels out.

So, P2 = (P1 * 2) / 8

Which simplifies to P2 = P1 * (2/8) = P1 * (1/4)

So P2 is P1 divided by 4. That means the pressure decreases by a factor of 4.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't flip anything. So, when T increases, pressure tends to increase, but when volume increases, pressure tends to decrease. Which effect is stronger here?

In this case, the volume increased much more. So the pressure should decrease.

So the new pressure is 1/4th of the original. So pressure decreases by a factor of 4.

Looking at the options, option G is "P decreases by a factor of 4." So that's the correct answer.

To determine how the pressure, \( P \), of an ideal gas changes when the temperature is increased by a factor of 2 and the volume is increased by a factor of 8, we use the ideal gas law:

\[
PV = nRT
\]

Since \( n \) (the number of moles) and \( R \) (the gas constant) are constant, we can relate the initial and final states of the gas. Let the initial pressure, volume, and temperature be \( P_1 \), \( V_1 \), and \( T_1 \), respectively, and the final pressure, volume, and temperature be \( P_2 \), \( V_2 \), and \( T_2 \). The equations for the initial and final states are:

\[
P_1 V_1 = nRT_1 \quad \text{and} \quad P_2 V_2 = nRT_2
\]

Dividing the final equation by the initial equation gives:

\[
\frac{P_2 V_2}{P_1 V_1} = \frac{T_2}{T_1}
\]

Rearranging to solve for \( P_2 \):

\[
P_2 = P_1 \cdot \frac{T_2}{T_1} \cdot \frac{V_1}{V_2}
\]

Substituting the given changes:
- \( T_2 = 2T_1 \) (temperature increases by a factor of 2),
- \( V_2 = 8V_1 \) (volume increases by a factor of 8),

we get:

\[
P_2 = P_1 \cdot \frac{2T_1}{T_1} \cdot \frac{V_1}{8V_1}
\]

Simplify:
- \( T_1 \) cancels out,
- \( V_1 \) cancels out,

\[
P_2 = P_1 \cdot \frac{2}{8} = P_1 \cdot \frac{1}{4}
\]

Thus, \( P_2 = \frac{P_1}{4} \), meaning the pressure decreases by a factor of 4.

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**G: P decreases by a factor of 4.**
