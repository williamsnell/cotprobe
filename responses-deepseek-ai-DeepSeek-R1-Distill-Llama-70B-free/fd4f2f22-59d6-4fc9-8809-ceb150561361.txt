Okay, so I have this problem about a loan being made on December 17th for a period of 120 days, and I need to figure out when it's due. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that when calculating due dates, you have to count each month's days carefully, especially around the end of the year. December has 31 days, so I should start there.

The loan starts on December 17th. So from December 17th to the end of December, how many days are left? Well, December has 31 days total. Subtracting the 17th, that leaves 31 - 17 = 14 days left in December.

Wait, but the total period is 120 days. So I'll subtract those 14 days from 120, which gives me 120 - 14 = 106 days remaining after December.

Now, moving into January. January has 31 days. Subtracting that from the remaining 106 days: 106 - 31 = 75 days left.

Next is February. Since it's not a leap year, February has 28 days. So subtracting that: 75 - 28 = 47 days remaining.

Then comes March with 31 days. Subtracting March from the remaining 47: 47 - 31 = 16 days left.

So now, the remaining 16 days would be in April. Since the question is asking for the due date, I add 16 days to April 1st. That would land on April 16th because April 1st is day 1, so adding 15 more days gets me to the 16th.

Wait, let me double-check that. If I start counting from April 1st as day 1, then adding 15 days would be April 16th. Yeah, that makes sense.

So putting it all together: 14 days in December, 31 in Jan, 28 in Feb, 31 in Mar, and then 16 in April. That adds up to 14+31=45, +28=73, +31=104, +16=120. Perfect, that matches the 120 days needed.

Looking at the options, option E is April 16th. So the correct answer should be E.

The loan is made on December 17th for 120 days. Breaking it down:

- From December 17 to December 31: 14 days remain in December.
- Subtracting these from 120 leaves 106 days.
- January has 31 days, leaving 75 days.
- February (28 days in a non-leap year) leaves 47 days.
- March has 31 days, leaving 16 days.
- These 16 days fall in April, making the due date April 16th.

Thus, the correct answer is **E: April 16**.
