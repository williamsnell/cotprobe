Okay, so I need to figure out the net price of a typewriter after applying a series of discounts. Let's see, the typewriter is priced at $80, and there are three discounts: 20%, 10%, and 5%. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about how these discounts are applied. Are they applied one after another, or is it some kind of combined discount?

Wait, I remember that when discounts are applied in series, each subsequent discount is applied to the price after the previous discount has been subtracted. So the process is step by step, each time taking a percentage off the current price. Let me break it down.

First, the original price is $80. The first discount is 20%. So I need to calculate 20% of 80 and subtract that from 80. 20% of 80 is 0.2 * 80 = $16. So subtracting that gives 80 - 16 = $64. 

Next, the second discount is 10%, but this is applied to the new price of $64, not the original $80. So I calculate 10% of 64, which is 0.1 * 64 = $6.4. Subtracting that from 64 gives 64 - 6.4 = $57.6. 

Then, the third discount is 5%, applied to the latest price of $57.6. So 5% of 57.6 is 0.05 * 57.6. Let me calculate that: 0.05 * 57.6 equals 2.88. Subtracting this gives 57.6 - 2.88 = $54.72.

So the net price after all three discounts would be $54.72. Let me check the options to see which one matches this. Looking at the options, option E is $54.72. So I think that's the correct answer.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me go through each step again.

First discount: 20% off $80. 20% is 0.2, so 80 * 0.2 = 16 off. 80 -16 =64. Correct.

Second discount: 10% off 64. 10% is 0.1, so 64 * 0.1 =6.4. 64-6.4=57.6. Yes.

Third discount: 5% off 57.6. 5% is 0.05, so 57.6 *0.05=2.88. 57.6-2.88=54.72. Yep, that seems right.

So the correct answer should be E: $54.72.

The net price is calculated by applying each discount sequentially to the reduced price after each step. 

1. **First discount (20%):**  
   20% of $80 is $16.  
   $80 - $16 = $64.

2. **Second discount (10%):**  
   10% of $64 is $6.40.  
   $64 - $6.40 = $57.60.

3. **Third discount (5%):**  
   5% of $57.60 is $2.88.  
   $57.60 - $2.88 = $54.72.

Thus, the net price is **$54.72**, which corresponds to option **E**.
