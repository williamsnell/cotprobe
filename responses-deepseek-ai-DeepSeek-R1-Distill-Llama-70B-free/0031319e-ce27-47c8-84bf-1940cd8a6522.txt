Question:

In 1888, a landowner owned a dairy farm. The landowner conveyed this real property to his son in1938. In 1953, the son conveyed the dairy farm to his friend. This deed was not recorded until after the son's death in 1957. In 1956, the son mortgaged the dairy farm to the bank. The mortgage instrument, which was recorded in 1956, recited that it was subordinate to a mortgage on the same land given by the son to an investor in 1936 and recorded in 1936. In that instrument the son purported to grant the investor a mortgage on the dairy farm. In 1979, the friend conveyed the dairy farm to a farmer. This deed was duly recorded, but did not mention any mortgage. In 2008, a buyer entered into an agreement with the farmer, whereby the farmer would convey the dairy farm in fee simple to the buyer for the sum of $75,000. The closing date was set for January 15, 2009. All of the deeds mentioned in the aforementioned transactions are general warranty deeds. In addition, this jurisdiction has a notice-type recording statute and follows a title theory for mortgages. On January 15, 2009, the sale of the dairy farm is finalized and the buyer paid the farmer $75,000. The fanner executed a general warranty deed. The deed contains the following covenants of title:(1) Covenant for seisin. (2) Covenant of the right to convey. (3) Covenant against encumbrances. After the buyer takes possession of the dairy farm, he learns of the son investor 1936 mortgage, which was not satisfied, and seeks monetary damages for breach of the covenant against encumbrances. Judgment should be for

Options:

A: the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances is a guarantee to the grantee that the property is not subject to outstanding rights or interests.
B: the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances would be breached at the time the deed was delivered, thereby entitling the covenantee to recover damages.
C: the farmer, because the covenant against encumbrances may only be breached, if at all, at the time of conveyance.
D: the farmer, unless the covenantee is disturbed in his actual enjoyment of the land thereby conveyed.

Okay, so I've got this real property question here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

So the situation involves a series of conveyances of a dairy farm. Let's map out the timeline first because that always helps me understand who owned what when.

Starting in 1888, the landowner owns the farm. Then in 1938, he conveys it to his son. So the son is now the owner. Next, in 1953, the son conveys it to his friend, but the deed isn't recorded until after the son's death in 1957. Hmm, recording after the son's death—interesting. I remember that recording statutes determine the priority of interests, right? Since this is a notice-type jurisdiction, I think that means that a later purchaser who has no notice of prior unrecorded interests can take priority. But I'm not sure how that plays into this scenario yet.

In 1956, the son mortgages the farm to the bank. The mortgage instrument is recorded in 1956 and states it's subordinate to a mortgage given to an investor in 1936, which was recorded then. So the investor's mortgage is senior to the bank's mortgage. Wait, but the son conveyed the farm to his friend in 1953, so when he mortgages it in 1956, does he still have an interest to mortgage? That's a point I need to think about.

Then in 1979, the friend conveys the farm to a farmer, and this deed is recorded but doesn't mention any mortgage. The farmer then sells it to a buyer in 2008, with the closing in 2009. The buyer pays $75k and gets a general warranty deed. The deed includes covenants of seisin, right to convey, and against encumbrances.

After taking possession, the buyer discovers the 1936 mortgage from the son to the investor, which wasn't satisfied. He's suing for breach of the covenant against encumbrances.

So the issue is whether the farmer (the seller) is liable for breaching the covenant against encumbrances because of this outstanding mortgage.

I remember that the covenant against encumbrances typically warrants that there are no outstanding liens or encumbrances except those noted in the deed. If the buyer finds an encumbrance, they can sue for damages. But when does the breach occur?

The key here is when the covenant is breached. I think in title theory states, the covenant against encumbrances is made as of the time of the conveyance. So if the farmer conveyed the property with an outstanding mortgage (the 1936 one), that's a breach because the covenant says there are no encumbrances except as noted.

Wait, but let's think about the chain of title. The son conveyed to the friend in 1953, but the deed wasn't recorded until 1957, after the son's death. So before 1957, does the friend's interest have priority? Or does the 1956 mortgage by the son still affect the title?

Wait, in 1953, the son conveyed to the friend. If that's a valid conveyance, then the son no longer owns the property, so when he mortgages it in 1956, does that mortgage attach to anything? Because if he no longer owns it, he can't mortgage it. But the friend's deed wasn't recorded until after the son's death. So before recording, the friend's ownership isn't on record. So when the son mortgages it in 1956, a subsequent purchaser might not have notice of the friend's ownership. But since the friend's deed was recorded in 1957, after the mortgage.

Wait, but the mortgage was recorded in 1956. The friend's deed was recorded in 1957. In a notice jurisdiction, a subsequent purchaser without notice can take free of prior unrecorded interests. But here, the friend's deed was unrecorded until 1957, so when the son mortgages to the bank in 1956, the bank would have no notice of the friend's interest, right? So the bank's mortgage would take priority over the friend's interest because the friend's deed wasn't recorded yet. But then the friend's deed is recorded in 1957, which is after the son's death.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to sort out the ownership:

- 1938: Son owns the farm.
- 1953: Son conveys to friend. Deed not recorded until 1957.
- 1956: Son mortgages to bank, which is recorded. It's subordinate to the 1936 mortgage to investor.
- 1957: Son dies. Friend's deed is recorded.

So up until 1957, the friend's interest isn't recorded. So when the son mortgages to the bank in 1956, the bank has no notice of the friend's ownership. So the bank's mortgage would take priority, right? But wait, the friend's deed was delivered in 1953, so he's the rightful owner, but because it's not recorded, the bank's mortgage, which is recorded, would have priority as a subsequent bona fide purchaser.

Wait, but in a notice jurisdiction, the rule is that a subsequent purchaser who pays value and has no notice of a prior unrecorded conveyance takes priority. So the bank in 1956, when they take the mortgage, would they have had notice of the friend's ownership? Since the friend's deed wasn't recorded until 1957, the bank didn't have notice, so their mortgage would take priority over the friend's unrecorded deed. Hmm, that seems possible.

But wait, the son conveyed to the friend in 1953, so the friend is the owner from that point. The son no longer owns the property, so when he mortgages it in 1956, does that even create a valid lien? Because you can't mortgage what you don't own. So maybe the 1956 mortgage isn't valid because the son didn't own the property anymore after 1953.

Wait, that's a good point. If the son conveyed the farm to the friend in 1953, then the son doesn't have title anymore. So any mortgage he gives in 1956 wouldn't attach to the property because he's not the owner. Therefore, the bank's mortgage wouldn't be valid against the friend's ownership.

But then why would the bank's mortgage be recorded in 1956, subordinate to the 1936 mortgage? Because the son was purporting to mortgage the farm, but he didn't own it. So that's a problem. So perhaps the 1956 mortgage isn't valid, but the 1936 mortgage is still there.

Wait, the 1936 mortgage was from the son to the investor. So if the son owned the property in 1936, then that mortgage was valid. But when the son conveyed to the friend in 1953, did he convey subject to that mortgage? Because the friend's deed is a general warranty deed, which typically includes covenants against encumbrances, but wait, the friend didn't record until 1957. So when the friend got the deed in 1953, he took subject to any encumbrances that the son had, unless the deed warranties say otherwise.

Wait, but the son's deed to the friend was a general warranty deed. So in that deed, the son would have covenanted against encumbrances, meaning he warrants that there are no outstanding liens or encumbrances except as stated. But the son had the 1936 mortgage to the investor. So when the son conveyed to the friend in 1953, he would have breached the covenant against encumbrances because the 1936 mortgage was still on the property. But since the friend didn't record until 1957, and the bank took a mortgage in 1956 without notice, perhaps the bank's mortgage is still valid against the friend.

Wait, no, because the son didn't own the property after 1953, so he couldn't mortgage it. So the 1956 mortgage to the bank wouldn't be valid, but the 1936 mortgage would still be on the property when the son conveyed to the friend in 1953. So the friend would take the property subject to that mortgage, unless the son's deed to the friend addressed it.

Wait, in the son's deed to the friend, which is a general warranty deed, the covenant against encumbrances would be breached because of the 1936 mortgage. So the friend could have sued the son for that breach. But the son's deed was in 1953, so any claim would be against him. But when the friend later sells to the farmer in 1979, the farmer gets a general warranty deed as well, which includes the covenant against encumbrances. So the farmer is warranting that there are no encumbrances except as noted. But the 1936 mortgage is still there, so that would be a breach.

Then the farmer sells to the buyer in 2009 with a general warranty deed, again including the covenant against encumbrances. So when the buyer discovers the 1936 mortgage, which was never satisfied, he can sue the farmer for breach.

Wait, but the farmer didn't create that mortgage; it was from the son to the investor in 1936. So does the farmer have any liability? Because the farmer's deed warranted against encumbrances, so if the property is still encumbered by that mortgage, the farmer breached the covenant.

Wait, but the chain of title: son to friend in 1953, friend to farmer in 1979, farmer to buyer in 2009. Each time with general warranty deeds. So each prior grantor covenanted against encumbrances. So when the buyer sues, he can sue the farmer because the farmer's deed included that covenant.

Wait, but in some cases, the covenant against encumbrances is a present covenant, meaning it's breached at the time of conveyance if there's an encumbrance. So if the farmer conveyed the property with an existing mortgage, that's a breach at the time of conveyance, regardless of whether the buyer is disturbed.

Other covenants, like the covenant of quiet enjoyment, might require actual disturbance, but the covenant against encumbrances is about the state of the title at the time of the conveyance.

So when the farmer conveyed to the buyer, the 1936 mortgage was still on the property. Therefore, the farmer breached the covenant against encumbrances at the time of the conveyance, entitling the buyer to damages.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Buyer wins because covenant is a guarantee against encumbrances. That seems correct, but let's check others.

Option B: Buyer wins because breach at delivery, so damages. This also seems correct.

Option C: Farmer, because breach only at conveyance. Wait, no, because the breach is at conveyance. So if the covenant is breached then, the buyer can recover.

Option D: Farmer unless buyer is disturbed. That relates more to future covenants, I think.

Wait, but I might be getting the present and future covenants mixed up. Present covenants (like seisin, right to convey, against encumbrances) are breached at the time of conveyance, so the buyer can sue immediately. Future covenants (like quiet enjoyment, warranty) require the buyer to be disturbed.

In this case, the covenant against encumbrances is a present covenant, so the breach occurs at the time of the deed delivery. Therefore, the buyer can sue for damages without waiting to be disturbed.

So the correct answer would be B: the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances is breached at delivery, so damages are due.

Wait, but let me think again. The 1936 mortgage was on the property when the son conveyed to the friend in 1953. The friend's deed was a general warranty, so the son was in breach then. But the friend didn't record until 1957, so when the son mortgages to the bank in 1956, the bank's mortgage would be valid only if the bank had no notice. But since the friend's deed wasn't recorded, the bank didn't have notice, so their mortgage would take priority. But the son didn't own the property anymore, so could he mortgage it? Probably not, so the 1956 mortgage wouldn't be valid. So the only encumbrance is the 1936 mortgage.

So when the friend conveys to the farmer in 1979, the farmer's deed includes the covenant against encumbrances, which is breached because of the 1936 mortgage. Then the farmer conveys to the buyer, again with the same covenant, which is breached.

So each subsequent grantor (friend, farmer) is breaching the covenant against encumbrances because the mortgage is still there. So when the buyer sues, it's the farmer who is the immediate grantor and thus liable.

So the judgment should be for the buyer because the farmer's covenant was breached when the deed was delivered, so the buyer can recover damages regardless of whether they've been disturbed.

Looking back at the options, option B says: the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances would be breached at the time the deed was delivered, so the covenantee can recover damages. That aligns with what I'm thinking.

So the answer should be B.

The question revolves around a series of conveyances of a dairy farm and the breach of the covenant against encumbrances. The key issue is whether the farmer, as the grantor, is liable for the outstanding 1936 mortgage when they conveyed the property to the buyer in 2009.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Chain of Title and Encumbrances**:
   - In 1938, the landowner conveyed the farm to his son, who then mortgaged it to an investor in 1936. This mortgage was recorded and remained unsatisfied.
   - In 1953, the son conveyed the farm to his friend, but the deed was not recorded until 1957, after the son's death. At the time of the conveyance, the 1936 mortgage was still an encumbrance on the property.
   - In 1956, the son attempted to mortgage the farm to the bank, but since the son no longer owned the property after conveying it to the friend in 1953, this mortgage was invalid and could not attach to the property.

2. **Covenant Against Encumbrances**:
   - The covenant against encumbrances is a present covenant, meaning it is breached at the time of conveyance if the property is subject to any outstanding liens or encumbrances not noted in the deed.
   - When the farmer conveyed the farm to the buyer in 2009 via a general warranty deed, the 1936 mortgage was still an encumbrance. This constituted a breach of the covenant against encumbrances at the time of the conveyance.

3. **Liability of the Farmer**:
   - The farmer, as the immediate grantor, is liable for the breach of the covenant against encumbrances. The breach occurred when the deed was delivered, and the buyer is entitled to damages regardless of whether they were disturbed in their enjoyment of the property.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: While correct that the covenant against encumbrances guarantees the property is free of outstanding rights or interests, it does not emphasize the timing of the breach.
- **Option B**: Correct. The covenant against encumbrances is a present covenant, breached at the time of conveyance. The buyer is entitled to damages because the property was encumbered by the 1936 mortgage when the deed was delivered.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The covenant against encumbrances is breached at the time of conveyance, and the buyer does not need to be disturbed to recover damages.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. This applies to future covenants, such as the covenant of quiet enjoyment, which require actual disturbance. The covenant against encumbrances is a present covenant.

### Conclusion:
The judgment should be for the buyer because the covenant against encumbrances was breached when the deed was delivered, entitling the buyer to recover damages. The correct answer is:

**B: the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances would be breached at the time the deed was delivered, thereby entitling the covenantee to recover damages.**
