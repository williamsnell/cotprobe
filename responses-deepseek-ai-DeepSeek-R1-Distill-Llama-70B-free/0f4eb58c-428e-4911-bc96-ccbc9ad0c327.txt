Question:

Doug Dogman had a domesticated golden retriever named Rover. Rover was a good, friendly dog who loved to run and chase cars but had never hurt anyone. One dark evening before the street lights turned on, Rover was chasing cars in the street, and Ginny Grandmother, aged 85, swerved to avoid hitting the dog. As she swerved, Ginny hit a parked car and suffered a head injury. If Ginny brings suit against Doug Dogman under a strict liability theory, the court will likely find for

Options:

A: Doug, unless a statute or ordinance bans unleashed dogs on public streets.
B: Doug, because Retriever is a domesticated animal.
C: Ginny, because Rover was not on a leash and was not supervised.
D: Doug, because Ginny was responsible for maintaining control of her vehicle.
E: Ginny, because Rover was chasing cars, a potentially dangerous activity.
F: Ginny, because Doug's dog was a cause in fact of Ginny's injuries.
G: Doug, because the strict liability rule for dogs would not include dogs not displaying vicious propensities.
H: Doug, because Rover was not known to be a dangerous dog.
I: Doug, because Ginny was negligent in hitting a parked car.
J: Ginny, because Doug was not present when the incident occurred.

Okay, so I've got this question about tort law, specifically strict liability and dogs. Let me try to work through this step by step. 

The scenario is about Doug Dogman and his golden retriever, Rover. Rover is described as friendly, never hurt anyone, but he likes to chase cars. One evening, Ginny, an 85-year-old woman, swerves to avoid hitting Rover and ends up hitting a parked car, getting a head injury. She's suing Doug under strict liability.

I remember that strict liability for dogs usually applies when the dog has a known vicious propensity. So, if the dog has a history of being dangerous or aggressive, the owner can be held strictly liable for any injuries caused by the dog. But if the dog is not known to be dangerous, like in this case where Rover is a golden retriever and friendly, maybe the rule is different.

Wait, but the question says Ginny is suing under a strict liability theory. So I need to think about when strict liability applies. I think the general rule is that for most dogs, the owner isn't strictly liable unless the dog has a known tendency to cause harm. So if Rover had bitten someone before, Doug would be liable, but since he's just chasing cars, maybe not.

Looking at the options, let's go through them. Option A says Doug wins unless there's a statute or ordinance banning unleashed dogs. So if the law says dogs must be on leashes and Rover wasn't, maybe Doug would be liable. But the question doesn't mention any such statute, so I'm not sure if that's the key here.

Option B says Doug wins because Retrievers are domesticated. I don't think that's right. All dogs are domesticated, so that can't be the determining factor.

Option C says Ginny wins because Rover wasn't on a leash and unsupervised. But I thought strict liability is more about the dog's behavior, not just being unleashed. Unless there's a negligence per se situation, where breaking a leash law is negligence, but the question is about strict liability, not negligence.

Option D says Doug wins because Ginny should control her vehicle. That seems more like a comparative negligence argument, but the question is about strict liability, so maybe not relevant here.

Option E says Ginny wins because Rover was chasing cars, which is dangerous. But if Rover isn't known to be dangerous, does the activity alone make Doug liable? I'm not sure. Maybe if chasing cars is an abnormally dangerous activity, but I don't think so. It's more of a nuisance maybe.

Option F says Ginny wins because Rover was a cause in fact. Cause in fact is about actual cause, which is part of both negligence and strict liability, but the issue is whether strict liability applies regardless of fault. So this might be true, but I don't think it's the deciding factor here.

Option G says Doug wins because strict liability doesn't apply to dogs without vicious propensities. That aligns with what I was thinking earlier. If Rover isn't known to be dangerous, strict liability might not apply. So the court would probably side with Doug unless there's a statute involved.

Option H says Doug wins because Rover isn't known to be dangerous. This seems similar to G, and I think that's the correct approach.

Option I says Doug wins because Ginny was negligent. Again, that's a negligence argument, but the question is about strict liability.

Option J says Ginny wins because Doug wasn't present. I don't think that matters. Strict liability is about the dog's tendencies, not the owner's presence.

So putting it together, the key is whether Rover had any known vicious propensities. Since he's a friendly golden retriever who just likes to chase cars, there's no indication he's dangerous. Therefore, strict liability wouldn't apply unless there's a statute making the owner liable for unleashed dogs. But in the absence of such a statute, the court would likely find for Doug.

Looking at the options, both G and H are about the dog not having vicious propensities. G says the strict liability rule wouldn't include such dogs, H says because Rover wasn't known to be dangerous. Either could be correct, but the traditional rule is that without vicious propensities, strict liability doesn't apply. So I think G or H is the answer.

Wait, the question asks what the court will likely find. So if the rule is that strict liability applies only when the dog has known vicious tendencies, and since Rover doesn't, the court would find for Doug. So the correct answer would be G or H.

But looking at the options again, option G says "the strict liability rule... would not include dogs not displaying vicious propensities." That's the general rule. So the answer should be G.

Alternatively, option H says "because Rover was not known to be a dangerous dog." That's similar, but G is more about the rule, H is about the specific case. Since the question is about the application of strict liability, I think G is more accurate.

Wait, but another thought: Some jurisdictions might have statutes that impose strict liability on owners for any injury caused by their dogs, regardless of the dog's history. But the question doesn't mention any such statute. So without a statute, the common law applies, which requires the dog to have known vicious propensities.

So the answer depends on whether the jurisdiction applies strict liability only when the dog has such propensities. Since the question doesn't state any statute, the answer would be that Doug isn't strictly liable because Rover isn't known to be dangerous. So between G and H, I think G is the better answer because it's about the rule not applying to such dogs.

But wait, another angle: In some places, the mere act of a dog being at large (not leashed) could impose liability under a statute, but again, the question doesn't mention any such law. So without that, the strict liability doesn't apply, and the court would find for Doug. So the correct answer is G.

The question revolves around whether Doug Dogman can be held strictly liable for injuries caused by his dog, Rover, under the circumstances described. Strict liability for dogs typically applies when the dog has a known vicious propensity or dangerous tendencies. In this case, Rover is described as a friendly golden retriever who had never hurt anyone, and his behavior of chasing cars does not indicate any known dangerous tendencies.

Option A suggests that Doug would win unless there is a statute or ordinance banning unleashed dogs. However, the question does not mention such a statute, so this is not the decisive factor. Option B incorrectly assumes that strict liability applies simply because Rover is a domesticated animal, which is not the standard for strict liability. Option C argues that Ginny would win because Rover was unleashed and unsupervised, but strict liability is not solely based on a dog being unleashedâ€”it depends on the dog's known behavior. Option D shifts blame to Ginny for not controlling her vehicle, which is a negligence argument and not relevant to strict liability. Option E claims Ginny would win because Rover was chasing cars, but chasing cars alone does not establish dangerousness unless Rover had a known history of such behavior causing harm. Option F focuses on causation, which is a factor but not sufficient to impose strict liability without evidence of dangerous tendencies. Option G correctly states that strict liability does not apply to dogs without known vicious propensities, aligning with the general rule. Option H also supports Doug because Rover was not known to be dangerous, which is consistent with the facts. Option I introduces negligence, which is not the issue here, and Option J incorrectly focuses on Doug's absence, which is irrelevant to strict liability.

The key issue is whether Rover had known vicious propensities, and since he did not, strict liability does not apply. The most accurate answer is Option G, as it directly addresses the rule that strict liability does not include dogs without known dangerous tendencies.

Answer: G
