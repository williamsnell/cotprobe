Question:

Late one night, an accountant walked into a bar and ordered a whiskey sour. The bartender served the drink, even though the accountant looked and acted as though he was already very intoxicated. The accountant soon had consumed five more cocktails, which the bartender served, despite the accountant's obviously and unmistakably drunken condition. After finishing his sixth drink in the bar, the accountant said good night to the bartender, staggered out of the bar, got into his car, and drove away. After weaving back and forth across the road for several blocks, the accountant crashed his car into a pedestrian who was walking on the sidewalk next to the road. The pedestrian suffered serious injuries to his back and legs. The bartender's act of serving drinks to the accountant would most likely be viewed as the

Options:

A: nominal cause of the pedestrian's injuries.
B: intervening cause of the pedestrian's injuries.
C: contributing cause of the pedestrian's injuries.
D: remote cause of the pedestrian's injuries.
E: proximate cause of the pedestrian's injuries.
F: superseding cause of the pedestrian's injuries.
G: incidental cause of the pedestrian's injuries.
H: secondary cause of the pedestrian's injuries.
I: underlying cause of the pedestrian's injuries.
J: direct cause of the pedestrian's injuries.

Okay, so I've got this question here about tort law, specifically dealing with causation. Let me try to break it down. 

The scenario is that an accountant goes into a bar, orders a whiskey sour, and the bartender serves him even though he looks really drunk. Then he has five more cocktails, and the bartender keeps serving despite the accountant being obviously intoxicated. After six drinks, he leaves, drives, weaves across the road, and hits a pedestrian, causing serious injuries. The question is about how the bartender's actions are viewed in terms of causation for the pedestrian's injuries.

I remember that in tort law, especially negligence, there's the concept of proximate cause and foreseeability. The idea is that the defendant's action must be a substantial factor in causing the harm, and the harm must be a foreseeable result of that action.

So the options are about different types of causation. Let me go through each option.

Option A: nominal cause. Nominal cause is usually something trivial, not really contributing. But here, serving multiple drinks clearly contributed, so probably not A.

Option B: intervening cause. An intervening cause is an event that breaks the chain of causation. If the cause is unforeseeable, it might be a superseding cause. But the accountant getting drunk and driving isn't an intervening cause because it's a foreseeable result of serving someone who's already intoxicated. So B might not be right.

Option C: contributing cause. Contributing cause means it's one of the factors that leads to the harm. Serving the drinks definitely contributed. But the question is about how the law views the bartender's act. I'm not sure if contributing cause is the specific legal term here.

Option D: remote cause. A remote cause is too far removed from the injury. If the cause is not a direct enough link, it's called remote. But serving alcohol to someone visibly drunk is directly linked to their intoxication and subsequent actions, so D doesn't seem right.

Option E: proximate cause. Proximate cause means it's the primary cause, not too remote or unforeseeable. Since serving a drunk person who then drives and causes an accident is a foreseeable event, the bartender's action is a proximate cause. So E is a possibility.

Option F: superseding cause. A superseding cause is an unforeseeable event that breaks the chain. If the accountant's driving was so reckless that it's beyond what's expected, maybe that's a superseding cause, but I think the initial serving is still a proximate cause because the harm is foreseeable.

Option G: incidental cause. Incidental is more like a minor factor, which doesn't fit here.

Option H: secondary cause. I'm not as familiar with this term in this context. Secondary might mean not the main cause, but the main cause here is the drunk driving, which is a result of the bartender's actions.

Option I: underlying cause. Underlying might refer to a pre-existing condition, which isn't the case here.

Option J: direct cause. Direct cause implies no intervening steps. Here, the injury is a result of the accountant's driving, which is a step beyond the serving. So J might not be the right term.

Wait, but in tort law, the concept of proximate cause includes foreseeability. If it's foreseeable that serving a visibly intoxicated person would lead to them driving and causing harm, then the bartender's action is a proximate cause. So the answer would be E.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes when the injury is a result of someone else's action (like the drunk driving), it might be seen as a superseding cause. However, in many jurisdictions, serving alcohol to an intoxicated person who then causes harm is considered a foreseeable event, making the bartender liable under dram shop acts or negligence. So the serving is a proximate cause, making E the correct answer.

Alternatively, could it be a contributing cause (C)? But contributing cause isn't a specific legal term in the same way as proximate cause. The question asks how the act is "most likely viewed", so the legal term would be proximate cause.

Wait, another angle: The question is about the bartender's act being the type of cause. So the act (serving drinks) is a cause, but not the direct cause. The direct cause is the accountant's driving. So the bartender's action is a proximate cause because it's a substantial factor leading to the injury, even though it's not the immediate cause.

Yes, so E is the correct answer.

The question revolves around the legal concept of causation in tort law, specifically focusing on the bartender's act of serving alcohol to an intoxicated accountant who later caused harm to a pedestrian. The key issue is determining how the bartender's actions are viewed in terms of causation.

1. **Nominal Cause (A):** This refers to a trivial or insignificant cause, which does not apply here since serving alcohol to an intoxicated person clearly contributed to the harm.

2. **Intervening Cause (B):** An intervening cause breaks the chain of causation, but the accountant's drunk driving is a foreseeable result of being served alcohol while intoxicated. Thus, this is not an intervening cause.

3. **Contributing Cause (C):** While the bartender's actions contributed to the harm, "contributing cause" is not the specific legal term used to describe the relationship between the bartender's actions and the pedestrian's injuries.

4. **Remote Cause (D):** A remote cause is too far removed from the harm. Here, the bartender's actions are directly linked to the accountant's intoxication and subsequent driving, making this option incorrect.

5. **Proximate Cause (E):** Proximate cause refers to a cause that is a substantial factor in leading to the harm and is foreseeable. Serving alcohol to a visibly intoxicated person who then drives and causes an accident is a foreseeable event, making this the correct answer.

6. **Superseding Cause (F):** A superseding cause is an unforeseeable event that interrupts the chain of causation. The accountant's drunk driving is a foreseeable result of being served alcohol, so this does not apply.

7. **Incidental Cause (G):** This refers to a minor or indirect factor, which does not fit the circumstances here.

8. **Secondary Cause (H):** This implies a lesser cause, but the bartender's actions are a primary factor in the chain of events leading to the harm.

9. **Underlying Cause (I):** This typically refers to a pre-existing condition, which is irrelevant in this context.

10. **Direct Cause (J):** A direct cause involves no intervening steps, but the harm resulted from the accountant's driving, which is an intervening step.

The bartender's actions are best described as the **proximate cause** of the pedestrian's injuries because they were a substantial factor leading to the harm and the outcome was foreseeable.
