Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this investment question for Mr. James. Let me read it again. He's in a 50% income tax bracket and can choose between two types of bonds: corporate bonds yielding 8% or municipal bonds yielding 4.5%. The question is which is the wiser investment.

Hmm, I remember that the tax implications can really affect the return on investments. Corporate bonds are taxable, right? So the interest from them would be subject to income tax. On the other hand, municipal bonds are usually tax-exempt. So I think that means the interest from them isn't taxed.

Wait, let me think. If Mr. James buys corporate bonds, he gets 8% interest, but he's in the 50% tax bracket. So he has to pay half of that interest in taxes. That would leave him with 4% after taxes, right? Because 8% times 0.5 is 4%.

Now, the municipal bonds yield 4.5%, and since they're tax-exempt, he doesn't have to pay any taxes on that interest. So he gets the full 4.5%. Comparing that to the 4% after-tax from the corporate bonds, the municipal bonds give a better return.

So the wiser choice would be the municipal bonds because their after-tax yield is higher. Let me double-check the options. Option D is municipal bonds, and option G is corporate bonds. So the answer should be D.

Wait, are there any other factors? Like state taxes? Oh, the question doesn't mention state taxes, so I guess we can ignore that. Also, the question says they're bought at par value, so no discounts or premiums to consider.

I think that's it. Municipal bonds give a better after-tax return, so D is the correct answer.

The wiser investment for Mr. James, considering his 50% tax bracket, is municipal bonds. Corporate bonds yield 8%, but after paying 50% in taxes, the effective return is 4%. Municipal bonds yield 4.5%, which is tax-exempt, resulting in a higher after-tax return of 4.5%. 

Answer: D
