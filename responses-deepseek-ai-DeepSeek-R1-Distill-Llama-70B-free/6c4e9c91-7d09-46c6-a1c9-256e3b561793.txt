Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about classifying different hydrocarbons into their respective series: methane (alkane), ethylene, or acetylene. I remember that each series has a general formula based on the number of hydrogen atoms they have.

Hmm, the compounds given are C₁₂H₂₆, C₉H₁₆, C₇H₁₄, and C₂₆H₅₄. I need to determine each one's series.

I think I should start by recalling the general formulas for each series. 

Methane series (alkanes) have the formula CnH2n+2. Ethylene series (alkenes) are CnH2n. Acetylene series (alkynes) are CnH2n-2. Wait, wait. No, I think I got that wrong. Let me think again. For alkanes, it's CnH2n+2. Alkenes have one double bond, so they have two less hydrogens than alkanes, so their formula is CnH2n. Alkynes have a triple bond, so they have four less hydrogens, making it CnH2n-2. Or wait, maybe it's CnH2n-2. I think that's correct.

So for each compound, I'll calculate what 2n+2, 2n, and 2n-2 would be, and see which formula matches.

Let's take the first compound, C₁₂H₂₆.

For alkanes: 2n+2. n is 12, so 2*12 + 2 = 26. Oh, so H is 26, which matches. So C₁₂H₂₆ is an alkane (methane series). Got that.

Next, C₉H₁₆. Let's calculate the possible H for each series.

Alkane: 2n+2 = 2*9 +2 = 20. But the compound has 16 H. So not alkane.

Alkene: 2n = 2*9 = 18. Hmm, our compound has 16, which is two less than 18. Wait, that doesn't fit. Or maybe I should think in terms of general formula. For alkenes, the formula is CnH2n. So for n=9, 2*9=18. The compound has 16, which is 2 less. Wait, but wait, maybe I miscalculated. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe I should rearrange the formula to find n.

Wait, another approach: For each compound, find the value of 2n+2, 2n, 2n-2 and see which one matches.

Wait, let's take C₉H₁₆. So the number of H is 16. Let's set up equations for each series.

Assuming it's an alkane: 2n +2 =16 → 2n=14 →n=7. But the compound has n=9. Doesn't fit.

If it's an alkene: 2n =16 →n=8. But the compound has n=9. Doesn't fit.

If it's an alkyne: 2n-2=16 →2n=18 →n=9. Oh, that fits! Because n=9, which is exactly the number of carbons in the compound. So C₉H₁₆ is an alkyne (acetylene series). Wait, wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. Because acetylene series (alkynes) have the formula CnH2n-2. So for n=9, 2n-2 is 16, which matches. So yes, C₉H₁₆ is an alkyne, so acetylene series.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because sometimes the general formula for alkenes is CnH2n, but for each double bond. So if the molecule has one double bond, it's 2n. If more than one, it's less. Similarly, for alkynes, each triple bond reduces H by 2. So C₉H₁₆: the general formula for alkenes is 2n, which for n=9 would be 18. H is 16, which is two less than 18. So that would imply two double bonds or one triple bond. Because each double bond reduces H by 2, two double bonds would reduce by 4, making 18-4=14. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So perhaps it's better to stick with the initial method.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the degree of unsaturation. That's another approach. The degree of unsaturation can help determine whether it's an alkane, alkene, alkyne, or maybe something else like a ring.

The formula for degree of unsaturation is: Degrees = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X (halogens) or N here, it's (2C +2 - H)/2.

So for C₉H₁₆: C=9, H=16.

Degrees = (2*9 +2 -16)/2 = (20-16)/2=4/2=2. So two degrees of unsaturation. Which could be two double bonds, one double bond and one ring, or one triple bond. 

Wait, but if the formula for alkenes is CnH2n, then for n=9, 2n=18. H is 16, which is 2 less than 18. So that would mean one double bond plus another double bond (since each double bond reduces H by 2). That would require two double bonds, which would give 18-2*2=14 H. But the compound has 16, which is only 2 less than 18. So that would mean one double bond and one ring. Because a ring also counts as a degree of unsaturation.

Wait, but the formula for the ethylene series is CnH2n, which is for alkenes with one double bond. So if C₉H₁₆ has 16 H, perhaps it's an alkyne. Because for n=9, alkyne is C9H16, which fits.

Wait, wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's go back to the initial approach.

So C₉H₁₆: Does it fit any of the series?

Methane: for n=9, 2*9 +2=20. H is 16, so no.

Ethylene (alkene): 2*9=18. H is 16, which is less by 2. So that would imply maybe one ring and one double bond. But the formula for ethylene series is CnH2n, implying exactly one double bond. So in that case, the formula would be CnH2n, but the compound has 16, which is 2 less than 18. So that would mean it's not a simple alkene. Wait, but alternatively, perhaps it's an alkyne.

Because the alkyne formula is CnH2n-2. So for n=9, 2*9-2=16. So yes! So C9H16 is an alkyne, so acetylene series.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the degree of unsaturation is 2, which could mean either two double bonds or one triple bond. So it fits for one triple bond, which would make it an alkyne.

So that's the second compound classified as acetylene series.

Wait, but looking at the options, the second compound is C9H16. Let's see what the options say. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are A-J, each giving classifications for the four compounds. But maybe I can come back to that after classifying all four.

Moving on to C7H14.

Again, let's calculate.

Methane (alkane): 2n+2. n=7 →2*7+2=16. But the compound has 14 H. So not alkane.

Ethylene (alkene): 2n=14 →n=7. So yes, that fits. So C7H14 is an alkene, so ethylene series.

Wait, let me check the degree of unsaturation. (2*7 +2 -14)/2 = (16-14)/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation. That can be a double bond, so it fits as an alkene.

So third compound is ethylene series.

Now the last one, C26H54.

Let's calculate.

Methane (alkane): 2n+2. Let's solve for n.

H=54.

So 2n+2=54 →2n=52 →n=26. Oh, that fits exactly. So C26H54 is an alkane (methane series).

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. For n=26, 2n+2=54, yes. So yes, it's an alkane.

Wait, but let me think about that. If n=26, then 2n+2=54, which is exactly the H here. So yes, that's correct.

So now, to summarize:

C12H26 → alkane (methane series)
C9H16 → alkyne (acetylene series)
C7H14 → alkene (ethylene series)
C26H54 → alkane (methane series)

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check each.

C12H26: 2n+2=26 →n=12. Correct.

C9H16: 2n-2=16 →n=9. Correct.

C7H14: 2n=14 →n=7. Correct.

C26H54: 2n+2=54 →n=26. Correct.

So the four compounds are in the following series:

C12H26: methane (alkane)
C9H16: acetylene (alkyne)
C7H14: ethylene (alkene)
C26H54: methane (alkane)

Now, I need to look at the options and see which one matches this.

Looking at the options, each option (A-J) gives four classifications in order: C12H26, C9H16, C7H14, C26H54.

So in order, the correct classifications are:

C12H26: methane (alkane) → alkane series
C9H16: acetylene → acetylene series
C7H14: ethylene → ethylene series
C26H54: methane → alkane series

So the order is: alkane, acetylene, ethylene, alkane.

Wait, wait, no. Let me re-express.

Wait, the four compounds, in order, are:

1. C12H26 → alkane (methane series)
2. C9H16 → acetylene series
3. C7H14 → ethylene series
4. C26H54 → alkane series

So looking for the option where:

First is alkane, second acetylene, third ethylene, fourth alkane.

Looking at the options:

Option E: Let me see.

Option E says:

C12H26: alkane series,

C9H16: ethylene,

C7H14: acetylene,

C26H54: ethylene.

No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I should look for each option.

Option A:

C12H26: alkane,

C9H16: ethylene,

C7H14: alkane,

C26H54: ethylene.

No, because C9H16 should be acetylene.

Option B:

C12H26: acetylene,

C9H16: ethylene,

C7H14: alkane,

C26H54: alkane.

No, because first should be alkane.

Option C:

C12H26: acetylene,

C9H16: ethylene,

C7H14: alkane,

C26H54: ethylene.

Nope.

Option D:

C12H26: ethylene,

C9H16: alkane,

C7H14: acetylene,

C26H54: ethylene.

No, not correct.

Option E:

C12H26: alkane,

C9H16: ethylene,

C7H14: acetylene,

C26H54: ethylene.

No, because C9H16 should be acetylene.

Option F:

C12H26: ethylene,

C9H16: acetylene,

C7H14: alkane,

C26H54: acetylene.

Nope, first should be alkane, second acetylene, third ethylene.

Option G:

C12H26: alkane,

C9H16: ethylene,

C7H14: acetylene,

C26H54: alkane.

No, because C9H16 is acetylene, not ethylene.

Option H:

C12H26: ethylene,

C9H16: acetylene,

C7H14: alkane,

C26H54: alkane.

No, first is wrong.

Option I:

C12H26: alkane,

C9H16: acetylene,

C7H14: ethylene,

C26H54: alkane.

Wait, yes, this matches exactly what I have. So option I.

Wait, let me check again. Option I:

C12H26: alkane,

C9H16: acetylene,

C7H14: ethylene,

C26H54: alkane.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but let me look again. The options are:

Option I: C12H26: alkane series,

C9H16: acetylene series,

C7H14: ethylene series,

C26H54: alkane series.

Yes, that's exactly the result I got.

So the correct answer is option I.

   - Methane series: \( 2n+2 = 54 \) → \( n = 26 \). Matches \( C_{26}H_{54} \).
   - Classification: **Methane series (alkane)**.

### Final Classification:
- \( C_{12}H_{26} \): Methane series (alkane)
- \( C_9H_{16} \): Acetylene series (alkyne)
