Okay, so I have this statistics problem in front of me. Let's try to break it down step by step. The question is about approximating a probability involving the sample mean from an exponential distribution. Hmm, I remember that the exponential distribution is a continuous probability distribution, right? And it's often used to model the time between events in a Poisson process.

The problem says that the mean of the exponential distribution is 3. So, if I recall correctly, the mean (μ) of an exponential distribution is related to its rate parameter (λ) by μ = 1/λ. Wait, no, wait. I think it's the other way around. Oh right, for an exponential distribution, the probability density function is f(x) = λe^(-λx) for x ≥ 0, and the mean is 1/λ. So if the mean is 3, then λ must be 1/3. Yeah, that makes sense.

Now, the sample size is 36. The question is asking for P(2.5 ≤ X̄ ≤ 4), where X̄ is the sample mean. I remember that when dealing with the sample mean from an exponential distribution, the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) applies, especially since the sample size is large (n=36, which is pretty decent). So the CLT tells us that the distribution of X̄ will be approximately normal, regardless of the original distribution's shape, as long as n is large enough.

So, the first thing I need to find is the mean and standard deviation of X̄. For the sample mean, the expected value E[X̄] is just the population mean, which is 3 in this case. That's straightforward.

Next is the standard deviation of X̄, which is the population standard deviation divided by the square root of n. Wait, what's the variance of an exponential distribution? Oh right, the variance is (1/λ)^2. Since λ is 1/3, the variance would be (3)^2 = 9. So the standard deviation (σ) is sqrt(9) = 3.

So the standard deviation of X̄ is σ / sqrt(n) = 3 / sqrt(36) = 3/6 = 0.5. Got that.

Now, I can model X̄ as approximately normal with mean 3 and standard deviation 0.5. So, X̄ ~ N(3, 0.5^2). Now, I need to find P(2.5 ≤ X̄ ≤ 4). To find this probability, I should convert the values to Z-scores and use the standard normal distribution table or calculator.

Let's compute the Z-scores for both 2.5 and 4. The Z-score formula is Z = (X - μ) / σ. So:

For X = 2.5:
Z = (2.5 - 3) / 0.5 = (-0.5) / 0.5 = -1.

For X = 4:
Z = (4 - 3) / 0.5 = 1 / 0.5 = 2.

Wait, wait, no, that's not right. Let me double-check. Oh wait, no, the standard deviation of X̄ is 0.5, correct. So 4-3 is 1, divided by 0.5 is 2. That's right. And 2.5-3 is -0.5, divided by 0.5 is -1.0. So the Z-scores are -1 and +2.

So I need to find P(-1 ≤ Z ≤ 2) where Z is the standard normal variable. To find this, I can compute the cumulative distribution function (CDF) at 2 and subtract the CDF at -1.

Looking at standard normal tables or using a calculator, the CDF at Z=2 is about 0.9772, and at Z=-1, it's about 0.1587. So subtracting gives 0.9772 - 0.1587 = 0.8185. So the probability is approximately 0.8185.

Looking at the options, option I is 0.8185. So the correct answer should be I.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Let me recheck the steps.

1. Exponential distribution with mean 3 → λ=1/3.
2. Sample size n=36 → large enough for CLT.
3. E[X̄] = 3, Var(X̄) = Var(X)/n = (9)/36 = 0.25 → so SD is 0.5.
4. X̄ ~ N(3, 0.25).
5. Compute P(2.5 ≤ X̄ ≤4) → Z-scores: (2.5-3)/0.5=-1; (4-3)/0.5=2.
6. P(-1 ≤ Z ≤ 2) = Φ(2) - Φ(-1) = 0.9772 - 0.1587 = 0.8185.
7. So the answer is I: 0.8185.

Yes, that seems correct.

To approximate \( P(2.5 \leq \bar{X} \leq 4) \), we start by noting that the population follows an exponential distribution with mean 3. For an exponential distribution, the rate parameter \( \lambda \) is the reciprocal of the mean, so \( \lambda = \frac{1}{3} \). The variance of the exponential distribution is \( \text{Var}(X) = \frac{1}{\lambda^2} = 9 \), and the standard deviation is \( \sigma = 3 \).

Since the sample size \( n = 36 \) is large, the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) applies, and the sample mean \( \bar{X} \) is approximately normally distributed with mean \( \mu_{\bar{X}} = 3 \) and standard deviation \( \sigma_{\bar{X}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{36}} = 0.5 \). Thus, \( \bar{X} \sim N(3, 0.5^2) \).

To find \( P(2.5 \leq \bar{X} \leq 4) \), we convert the bounds to Z-scores using the formula \( Z = \frac{X - \mu_{\bar{X}}}{\sigma_{\bar{X}}} \):

- For \( X = 2.5 \): \( Z = \frac{2.5 - 3}{0.5} = -1 \).
- For \( X = 4 \): \( Z = \frac{4 - 3}{0.5} = 2 \).

We then calculate \( P(-1 \leq Z \leq 2) \) using the standard normal distribution. From standard normal tables:

- \( P(Z \leq 2) = 0.9772 \),
- \( P(Z \leq -1) = 0.1587 \).

Thus, \( P(-1 \leq Z \leq 2) = 0.9772 - 0.1587 = 0.8185 \).

The correct answer is **I: 0.8185**.
