Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about Sally driving her Mustang, and we're supposed to find the position X where her car reaches maximum velocity in the x-direction.

From what I remember, maximum velocity in an object's motion under acceleration occurs when the acceleration becomes zero. So the first thing I think is, I need to find the time t when the acceleration a_x equals zero. Once I have that time, I can plug it into the position equation to find X.

The acceleration is given as a function of time: a_x = 2.0 m/s² - (0.10 m/s³) * t. So setting a_x to zero gives:

0 = 2.0 - 0.10 * t

Hmm, solving for t. Let's see, moving the 0.10 t to the left:

0.10 t = 2.0

So t = 2.0 / 0.10 = 20 seconds. Oh wait, that seems straightforward. So the time at which the velocity is maximum is 20 seconds.

Now, to find the position X at this time, I need to integrate the acceleration to get velocity, and then integrate velocity to get position. But wait, maybe there's a more direct way. I recall that when acceleration is given, the position can be found by integrating the acceleration twice, considering initial conditions.

So let's start from the beginning. The acceleration as a function of time is given. The initial conditions might be important here. I think the problem states that Sally is moving in the positive x-direction when she passes the signpost. But wait, the problem says 'when she is moving at in the positive x-direction, she passes a signpost at...' Oh wait, maybe I misread that. The problem says, "At when she is moving at in the positive x-direction, she passes a signpost at..." Hmm, maybe that's a typo or unclear. Wait, perhaps the intended statement is that she passes a signpost at a certain position, say x=0, at a certain time, perhaps t=0. Oh, I think the signpost is at x=0 when t=0, making it the starting point.

Assuming that at t=0, the position x is 0. Also, the initial velocity: I think we are to assume that at t=0, Sally is moving with some initial velocity, maybe zero? But the problem doesn't specify. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Wait, the problem says she passes the signpost when moving in the positive x-direction, so perhaps at t=0, her position is x=0, and her velocity is, I guess, not zero. Or maybe it's zero. Wait, the problem doesn't specify the initial velocity, so perhaps we can assume that at t=0, the velocity is zero. Or perhaps not. Hmm, this is a bit tricky.

Wait, let's read the problem again. It says: "At when she is moving at in the positive x-direction, she passes a signpost at..." Oh, perhaps that was a typo, and they meant she passes a signpost at x=0 at t=0, moving in the positive x-direction. So perhaps the initial position x(0) = 0, and initial velocity v(0) = some value. But the problem doesn't specify v(0), so maybe it's zero. Alternatively, maybe the initial velocity is not zero, but the problem doesn't say. Hmm, this is a bit of a problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is missing some information. Oh wait, the problem says, "At when she is moving at in the positive x-direction, she passes a signpost at..." Maybe it's a typo, and the intended statement is that she passes a signpost at a certain position, say X meters. But wait, that's what we're trying to find, so perhaps the initial position is not zero. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial conditions are as follows: at time t=0, Sally is at position x=0, and she's moving with some initial velocity. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe the initial velocity is zero. So let's proceed with that assumption.

Wait, but when I integrate the acceleration to get velocity, and then position, I'll have constants of integration. Without initial conditions, those constants could be anything, but perhaps the problem gives enough info to determine them.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, acceleration a_x = 2.0 - 0.10 t.

To find velocity v(t), we integrate a_x with respect to time:

v(t) = ∫ a_x dt = ∫ (2.0 - 0.10 t) dt = 2.0 t - (0.10 / 2) t² + C, where C is the constant of integration.

Similarly, position x(t) is the integral of velocity:

x(t) = ∫ v(t) dt = ∫ [2.0 t - 0.05 t² + C] dt = (2.0 / 2) t² - (0.05 / 3) t³ + C t + D, where D is another constant of integration.

Now, applying initial conditions. Let's assume that at time t=0, the position x is x_0, which I think is zero. So when t=0, x(0)=0. Plugging into x(t):

x(0) = 0 + 0 + C*0 + D = D = 0 → D = 0.

So x(t) = t² - (0.05/3) t³ + C t.

But wait, we also need to find C, which comes from the initial velocity. If at t=0, the velocity is v_0, then v(0) = 0 + C = v_0. But the problem doesn't specify v_0. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial velocity is zero. Let's assume that. So v(0) = 0 → C = 0. So then:

v(t) = 2.0 t - 0.05 t².

x(t) = t² - (0.05/3) t³.

Wait, but the problem states that she is moving in the positive x-direction when she passes the signpost at X meters. So perhaps when she passes the signpost, she's at X meters. But wait, I thought x=0 at t=0. Maybe the signpost is at X meters, so perhaps x(t) = X when the velocity is maximum, which is at t=20 seconds.

Wait, no. The question is, "At X meters, the car reaches maximum x-velocity." So X is the position where the maximum velocity occurs, which is at t=20 seconds. So we can plug t=20 into x(t) to find X.

So, x(20) = (20)^2 - (0.05/3)*(20)^3.

Wait, 20 squared is 400. 20 cubed is 8000. So:

x = 400 - (0.05/3)*8000.

Calculating that: 0.05 * 8000 = 400. Then, 400/3 ≈ 133.333.

So x = 400 - 133.333 ≈ 266.667 meters. But looking at the options, none match that. So maybe my assumption about initial velocity is wrong.

Hmm, that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the integration. Let me double-check.

Wait, when I integrated a_x = 2.0 - 0.10 t, I got v(t) = 2t - 0.05 t² + C. Correct. Then integrating v(t), x(t) = t² - (0.05/3) t³ + C t + D. Correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider that the initial velocity v(0) is not zero. Because, in reality, when she passes the signpost, she's moving in the positive direction, so her initial velocity must be positive. But the problem didn't specify, so perhaps I need to find the initial velocity from some other condition.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm missing the fact that when she passes the signpost, that's at x=0, but that's at t=0. Alternatively, maybe the signpost is at some other position. Wait, but the question is asking for X, the position where maximum velocity occurs. So perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, another approach: the maximum velocity occurs when a_x = 0, which is at t=20s as we found earlier. The velocity as a function of time is v(t) = 2t - 0.05 t² + v_0, but without knowing v_0, we can't proceed. Alternatively, maybe I should find v_0 by some other condition.

Wait, perhaps the signpost is at x=0 at t=0, and she's moving with an initial velocity. So her position as a function of time is x(t) = (v_0) t + (1/2) a_x t². Wait, but that's not correct because a_x is not constant; it's a function of time. Oh right, because a_x is changing with time, so I can't use the constant acceleration equations. Hmm, this complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this by finding the general solution and then apply initial conditions.

So, a_x = 2.0 - 0.10 t.

Integrate a_x to get v(t):

v(t) = ∫ a_x dt = 2t - (0.10/2) t² + C = 2t - 0.05 t² + C.

The initial condition at t=0 is v(0) = v_0. So v(0) = 0 + 0 + C → C = v_0.

So, v(t) = 2t - 0.05 t² + v_0.

Now, the maximum velocity occurs when a_x = 0, which is at t=20s as before. So at t=20s, v = 2*20 - 0.05*(20)^2 + v_0.

v = 40 - 0.05*400 + v_0 → 40 - 20 + v_0 → 20 + v_0.

Wait, but without knowing v_0, I can't find the actual maximum velocity, but perhaps I don't need it because the question is about position, not velocity.

So, to find position x(t), integrate v(t):

x(t) = ∫ v(t) dt = ∫ (2t - 0.05 t² + v_0) dt

= t² - (0.05/3) t^3 + v_0 t + D.

At t=0, x(0) = 0 → D=0. So x(t) = t² - (0.05/3) t^3 + v_0 t.

But again, without knowing v_0, I can't compute x(20). So perhaps I've missed something.

Wait, perhaps the question implies that when Sally passes the signpost, she is at x=0, t=0, and her velocity is zero. That would make sense if the signpost is at the starting point. So let's assume that v_0 = 0 at t=0.

So then, v(t) = 2t - 0.05 t².

Then, x(t) = t² - (0.05/3) t^3.

At t=20s, x(20) = (20)^2 - (0.05/3)(20)^3.

Calculating that:

20^2 = 400.

20^3 = 8000.

So (0.05/3)*8000 = (0.05 * 8000)/3 = 400/3 ≈ 133.333.

So x(20) = 400 - 133.333 = 266.667 meters.

But looking at the options, the closest is not present. The options are 350, 420, 450, etc. So this suggests that perhaps my assumption that v_0=0 is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial conditions. Let me think again. Maybe when she passes the signpost, her velocity is not zero. So perhaps the signpost is at a position x=0, but she's moving with some initial velocity v_0 at t=0. But without knowing v_0, how can I proceed?

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the velocity at the signpost is zero. Alternatively, perhaps the question states that she passes the signpost when moving in the positive x-direction, but it doesn't say anything about her velocity. So maybe her initial velocity is zero, and she starts from x=0.

Wait, but then I get x=266.667 meters at t=20s, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the integration. Let me double-check.

Wait, a_x = 2.0 - 0.10 t.

v(t) = ∫ a_x dt = 2t - (0.10/2) t² + C = 2t - 0.05 t² + C.

Yes, that's correct.

x(t) = ∫ v(t) dt = ∫ (2t - 0.05 t² + C) dt = t² - (0.05/3) t^3 + C t + D.

Yes, correct.

If at t=0, x=0, then D=0.

So x(t) = t² - (0.05/3) t^3 + C t.

But if the initial velocity is zero, then C=0, so x(t) = t² - (0.05/3) t^3.

At t=20, x(20) ≈ 266.667 m, which isn't an option. So perhaps the initial velocity isn't zero. Alternatively, perhaps the signpost isn't at x=0.

Wait, maybe the signpost is at some other position, and I need to adjust for that. Let me think. Suppose that the signpost is at position X_sign, and at t=0, Sally is at X_sign, moving with some velocity. But without knowing X_sign or her velocity, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem provides the initial position and velocity, but I'm not seeing it. Let me read the problem again.

The problem states: "Sally is driving along a straight highway in her 1965 Mustang. At when she is moving at in the positive x-direction, she passes a signpost at Her x-acceleration as a function of time is a_x = 2.0 m/s² - (0.10 m/s³) t. At X meters, the car reaches maximum x-velocity? What is X?"

Wait, perhaps the problem is missing a word, and the correct sentence is: "At the moment when she is moving at [some speed] in the positive x-direction, she passes a signpost at [position X] meters." But the way it's written is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the intended setup is that when she passes the signpost (position X), she's moving in the positive x-direction, and we need to find X where her velocity is maximum. But that doesn't make sense because the maximum velocity occurs at t=20s, which would correspond to a specific X.

Wait, perhaps the question is that the signpost is at a certain position, say X meters, which is where she is when her velocity is maximum. So, the question is asking for that X.

Wait, but how would that work? Because her position at the time of maximum velocity is X, which is the value we're calculating. So perhaps the problem is correct as is, and the initial position is X_sign = 0, but with initial velocity v_0.

Wait, perhaps the initial velocity isn't zero. Let me think: perhaps I can find the initial velocity by using another condition, but I don't have any other information. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the maximum velocity occurs when the acceleration is zero, and then find the position at that time. So, as before, t=20s.

If I can't find X because I don't know the initial velocity, perhaps the problem assumes that the initial position is X_sign = 0, and that the initial velocity is zero. But as I saw earlier, that gives X=266.667m, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the position correctly. Let me recompute x(20) with the assumption that v_0=0.

x(20) = (20)^2 - (0.05/3)*(20)^3.

Calculating:

20^2 = 400.

20^3 = 8000.

0.05 * 8000 = 400.

400/3 ≈ 133.333.

So x = 400 - 133.333 = 266.667 meters, which is approximately 266.67 m.

Looking at the options, I don't see that. The options start at 350 (option D), then 420 (I), 450 (A), etc. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I should integrate the acceleration correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the equation of motion for variable acceleration.

Wait, another approach: the position as a function of time can be found by integrating the acceleration function twice.

Let me try that again.

Given a_x = 2.0 - 0.10 t.

Integration to velocity:

v(t) = ∫ a_x dt = ∫ (2.0 - 0.10 t) dt = 2.0 t - 0.05 t² + C.

At t=0, v(0) = C. So if the initial velocity is v_0, then C = v_0.

Now, integrating velocity to get position:

x(t) = ∫ v(t) dt = ∫ (2.0 t - 0.05 t² + v_0) dt = t² - (0.05/3) t³ + v_0 t + D.

At t=0, x(0) = D. The problem says she passes a signpost at X meters. Wait, perhaps X is the position where she is at t=0. So, x(0) = X. But the problem states that she's moving in the positive x-direction when she passes the signpost. So perhaps X is the initial position, which would be x(0) = X, so D = X.

Wait, but then in that case, the position as a function of time would be x(t) = X + v_0 t + t² - (0.05/3) t³.

But without knowing v_0, I can't proceed. Alternatively, maybe X is the position
