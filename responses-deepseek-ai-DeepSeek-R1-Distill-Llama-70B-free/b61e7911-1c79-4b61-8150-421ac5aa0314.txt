Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the number of coils in a helical spring. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see, what do I remember about springs and their design?

The question says that the deflection shouldn't exceed 1.5 inches under a certain load. The mean diameter is 2.25 inches, and the wire diameter is 0.15 inches. The allowable shear stress is 50,000 psi, and the shear modulus is 12e6 psi. I need to find the number of coils.

Wait, right, for helical springs, there are a couple of key formulas. One relates shear stress to the number of coils, and another relates deflection to the number of coils. Oh yeah, because the spring's behavior under load depends on both the stress it's subjected to and how much it deflects.

First, I think I should calculate the shear stress to ensure it's within the allowable limit, which will give me the minimum number of coils needed. Then, I also need to check the deflection to make sure it doesn't exceed 1.5 inches, which will give another condition on the number of coils. The actual number of coils must satisfy both conditions.

Let me jot down the formulas I remember. For shear stress in a helical spring, the formula is:

τ = (8 * W * D) / (π * d³)

Where:
- τ is the shear stress (here, allowable is 50,000 psi)
- W is the load (but wait, the problem doesn't give W directly. Hmm, maybe I need to express it in terms of W?)
Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Another formula for shear stress also involves the number of coils, but I think that's when you already know the stress or the load.

Alternatively, the formula I have is τ = (8 * W * D) / (π * d³), and this should be equal to the allowable shear stress. So I can solve for W in terms of τ, D, and d.

But wait, the problem doesn't give me W. Oh, but maybe I don't need to find W directly. Because the problem is about the number of coils, and for that, I think another formula is used which relates the number of coils (n), the deflection (δ), the load (W), the shear modulus (G), the diameter (D), and the wire diameter (d).

The formula for deflection is δ = (8 * W * D³ * n) / (G * d⁴)

But again, without knowing W, this seems tricky. Hmm. Wait, maybe I can relate the two formulas to eliminate W.

From the shear stress equation, I can solve for W.

τ = (8 W D) / (π d³)
=> W = (τ π d³) / (8 D)

Then plug this W into the deflection equation.

So δ = (8 * [(τ π d³) / (8 D)] * D³ * n) / (G d⁴ )

Let me simplify that step by step.

The 8 cancels with the denominator 8, so:

δ = (τ π d³ * D³ * n) / (G d⁴ D )

Wait, D³ divided by D gives D². d³ divided by d⁴ gives 1/d. So:

δ = (τ π D² n ) / (G d )

So now, I can solve for n.

n = (δ G d) / (τ π D² )

Putting in the numbers:

δ is 1.5 inches.
G is 12e6 psi.
d is 0.15 inches.
τ is 50,000 psi.
D is 2.25 inches.

Plugging in:

n = (1.5 * 12e6 * 0.15) / (50,000 * π * (2.25)^2 )

Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 1.5 * 12e6 = 18e6. 18e6 * 0.15 = 2.7e6.

Denominator: 50,000 * π is approximately 157,079. Then multiply by (2.25)^2 = 5.0625. So 157,079 * 5.0625 ≈ let's see, 157,079 *5= 785,395 and 157,079 *0.0625≈9,817. So total approximately 795,212.

So n ≈ 2.7e6 / 795,212 ≈ let's compute that.

2.7e6 is 2,700,000.

2,700,000 / 795,212 ≈ let's divide both by 1000: 2700 / 795.212 ≈ around 3.39.

Wait, that would give n≈3.39. But that can't be right because looking at the options, the smallest is 7.5. Hmm, did I make a mistake in the formula?

Wait, perhaps I confused the formula. Let me double-check the deflection formula. Oh wait, the formula I used was δ = (8WD³n)/(Gd^4). But I think I might have missed a factor, like maybe it's (8WD³n)/(Gd^4) multiplied by something else.

Wait, another thought: The formula for deflection in a helical spring is often given as δ = (8 W D³ n) / (G d^4 ), but maybe I should verify the exact formula.

Alternatively, another source says the formula for deflection is δ = (8 W (D/2)^3 n ) / (G d^4 ), but wait, D is the mean diameter, so the radius R is D/2. So perhaps the correct formula is δ = (8 W R³ n)/(G d^4 ), which would be (8 W (D/2)^3 n)/(G d^4 ) = (8 W D³ n)/(8 G d^4 ) ) = (W D³ n)/(G d^4 )

Wait, conflicting with what I had earlier. So I'm a bit confused now. Let me get this straight.

Wait, another approach: The general formula for the deflection of a helical spring under axial load is δ = (8 W D³ n) / (G d^4 ). Or is it (8 W D³ n)/(G d^4 ) ?

I think I might have made a mistake earlier when substituting. Because when I substituted W from the shear stress formula into the deflection equation, perhaps I messed up the factors.

Let me try that substitution again, but carefully.

Shear stress τ = (8 W D) / (π d^3 )

So solving for W:

W = (τ π d^3 ) / (8 D )

Now, substitute W into the deflection formula δ = (8 W D^3 n ) / (G d^4 )

So:

δ = (8 * [ (τ π d^3 )/(8 D) ] * D^3 * n ) / (G d^4 )

Let me compute this step by step.

The 8 in numerator and denominator (8 D) cancels, so:

δ = [ τ π d^3 * D^3 * n ] / (G d^4 D )

Wait, D^3 divided by D is D^2, and d^3 in numerator over d^4 denominator is 1/d.

So:

δ = (τ π D² n ) / (G d )

Which is the same as before. So my earlier substitution was correct.

So then, n = (δ G d ) / ( τ π D² )

Plugging the numbers again:

δ =1.5 in., G=12e6 psi, d=0.15 in., τ=50,000 psi, D=2.25 in.

n = (1.5 * 12e6 * 0.15 ) / (50,000 * π * (2.25)^2 )

Compute numerator: 1.5 * 12e6 = 18e6, 18e6 *0.15=2.7e6.

Denominator: 50,000 * π ≈157,079.62. Then multiply by (2.25)^2=5.0625.

So 157,079.62 *5.0625 ≈ 157,079.62 *5 =785,398.1, plus 157,079.62 *0.0625=9,817.49. So total ≈ 795,215.6.

So numerator 2.7e6 divided by denominator 795,215.6 → 2700000 / 795215.6 ≈ approx 3.39.

Wait, 3.39? But the options start at 7.5. So that can't be right. Something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor in the formula. Let me check another source or my notes.

Ah! Oh wait, I think I might have forgotten that in the deflection formula, the number of coils is actually the number of active coils, but perhaps I'm not accounting for something else. Alternatively, maybe I should have used the formula where the deflection is δ = (8 W D³ n) / (G d^4 ), but I think I did that.

Wait, another consideration: The wire diameter is d, and mean diameter is D. So the spring index, which is D/d, is 2.25 / 0.15 =15. That's a high spring index, which is good because it means lower stress for the same load.

But maybe I'm missing something else. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, let's recalculate the substitution again.

τ = (8 W D) / (π d³ )

So W = (τ π d³ ) / (8 D )

Then deflection δ = (8 W D³ n ) / (G d^4 )

Substituting W:

δ = (8 * (τ π d³ ) / (8 D) * D^3 * n ) / (G d^4 )

Simplify numerator: 8 cancels, so (τ π d^3 * D^3 * n ) / D = τ π d^3 D² n.

Divide by denominator G d^4 → (τ π D² n) / (G d )

So δ = (τ π D² n ) / ( G d )

Wait, so solving for n:

n = (δ G d ) / ( τ π D² )

Yes, that's correct. So the calculation I did earlier was right.

Wait, but getting 3.39, which isn't matching any options. That suggests I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the formula for shear stress considering the number of coils. Another approach: Find the required number of coils based on the allowable shear stress, then check if the deflection is within the limit.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the formulas. Let me look up the correct formula for the number of coils.

Wait, another thought: The formula for the shear stress in a spring is:

τ = (8 W D) / (π d^3 )

But this is for a given load W. But if I don't know W, perhaps I can express W in terms of the allowable shear stress.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify a load; it's about making sure that under a certain load (which would cause the allowable shear stress), the deflection doesn't exceed 1.5 inches.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that the number of coils affects both the stress and the deflection. So I need to find the minimum n that satisfies both τ ≤ 50,000 psi and δ ≤1.5 in.

But since the problem states "the deflection may not exceed 1.5 in under a certain load", perhaps the load is the one that causes the allowable shear stress. So W is determined by the allowable shear stress, and then using that W, find the n that makes δ=1.5.

Wait, but I think I tried that earlier, and it's giving me n≈3.39, which is too small.

Alternatively, maybe I inverted the formula somewhere. Let me re-express the formula.

From the shear stress equation:

W = (τ π d³) / (8 D )

From the deflection equation:

δ = (8 W D³ n ) / (G d^4 )

Substituting W:

δ = (8 * (τ π d^3 / (8 D )) * D^3 * n ) / (G d^4 )

Simplify:

The 8 cancels, so:

δ = (τ π d^3 D^3 n ) / ( D G d^4 )

Simplify D^3 / D → D², d^3 / d^4 → 1/d.

So δ = (τ π D² n ) / ( G d )

Solving for n:

n = (δ G d ) / ( τ π D² )

Plugging the numbers:

δ=1.5, G=12e6, d=0.15, τ=5e4, D=2.25.

n = (1.5 * 12e6 * 0.15) / (5e4 * π * (2.25)^2 )

Compute numerator: 1.5 *12e6 =18e6; 18e6 *0.15=2.7e6.

Denominator:5e4 * π ≈ 157,079.6327; (2.25)^2=5.0625; 157,079.6327 *5.0625 ≈795,215.8.

So 2.7e6 /795,215.8 ≈3.39.

Hmm, but this can't be right because the options are much higher.

Wait, maybe I made a calculation mistake. Let me compute the denominator again.

Compute denominator: 5e4 * π =50,000 *3.1416≈157,079.6.

(2.25)^2=5.0625.

Multiply 157,079.6 *5.0625.

Let me compute 157,079.6 *5 =785,398.

157,079.6 *0.0625= approx 157,079.6 * (1/16) )= approx 9,817.475.

So total denominator ≈785,398 +9,817.475≈795,215.475.

So 2.7e6 /795,215.475 → let me compute that.

2,700,000 ÷ 795,215.475.

Let me see, 795,215 *3=2,385,646. So 3 times 795,215 is about 2.385 million.

2.7 million is 2.7e6, so 2.7e6-2.385e6=315,000 left.

315,000 /795,215.475 ≈0.396.

So total n≈3.396, approximately 3.4.

But the options don't have anything close. So perhaps I did something wrong, or perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, maybe I should have used the formula for the number of coils based on the stress first, and then checked the deflection.

Wait, another approach: The number of coils can be found from the allowable shear stress and then ensure that the deflection is within the limit.

Wait, but without knowing the load, perhaps I'm conflating two different aspects. Alternatively, maybe I should be using the Wahl factor for shear stress, considering the spring index.

Wait, the Wahl factor is used when the wire is under torsion, and for springs, the shear stress is given by τ = (8 W D)/(π d³) multiplied by the Wahl factor. But the Wahl factor for a spring with a high spring index (D/d > 10) is approximately 1.0. Since D/d here is 15, the Wahl factor is 1. So perhaps I didn't need to adjust for that.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the formula where the number of active coils is related to the shear modulus and such.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula for deflection. Let me double-check.

Another source says that the deflection (δ) of a helical spring is given by:

δ = (8 W D³ n) / (G d^4 )

But I've also seen another formula where δ = (128 W D³ n)/(G d^4 ). Wait, that's a big difference. Did I miss a factor of 16?

Wait, why the discrepancy? Let me think. The formula for a helical spring under axial load is:

δ = (8 W D³ n) / (G d^4 ) * (1 + Q^2/2 ), where Q is the spring index (D/d). But for large Q, like 15, the term 1 + (225/2 )=1 +112.5=113.5, which would be a huge factor. That can't be right because that would make the deflection way too big.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the formulas for different types of loading. Alternatively, maybe the correct formula is δ = (8 W D³ n)/(G d^4 ), and that's it. Or perhaps I'm forgetting a 4 somewhere.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me look up the correct formula for the deflection of a helical spring under axial load.

Upon checking, the standard formula for deflection δ is:

δ = (8 W D³ n) / (G d^4 ) 

But wait, another source says δ = (128 W D³ n)/(G d^4 ), which is 16 times larger. That's a big difference. Where is this discrepancy coming from?

Ah, perhaps it's because sometimes the formula uses the radius R instead of diameter D. Let's clarify.

If R is the radius, then D = 2R. So let's express the formula in terms of R.

δ = (8 W (2R)^3 n ) / (G d^4 )

Which is 8 W 8 R^3 n / (G d^4 ) = 64 W R^3 n / (G d^4 )

Alternatively, another formula may express it as δ = (128 W R³ n )/(G d^4 ), which would make sense if the formula uses a factor that includes 16 from somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is δ = (128 W R³ n)/(G d^4 ). If that's the case, then when expressed in terms of D, it's δ = (128 W (D/2)^3 n )/(G d^4 ) = (128 W D^3 n )/(8 G d^4 ) = (16 W D³ n )/(G d^4 )

Wait, that would make the formula δ = (16 W D³ n )/(G d^4 )

But I'm getting more confused now because different sources seem to have different factors.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is δ = (8 W D³ n )/(G d^4
