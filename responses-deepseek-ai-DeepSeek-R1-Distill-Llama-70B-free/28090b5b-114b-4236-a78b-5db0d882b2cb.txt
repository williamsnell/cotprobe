Okay, so I have this question about study designs and their relation to evidence on sugars and dental caries. The question is asking which type of study provides the best evidence for an association between sugar intake and the risk of getting dental caries.

Hmm, I remember that different study designs have different strengths when it comes to establishing causation or association. Let me think about each option.

Option A is case-control study. I think case-control studies are good for looking at risk factors by comparing people with a condition (cases) to those without it (controls). They're often retrospective, so they can identify associations but might be subject to recall bias. Not the strongest for proving causation.

Option B is longitudinal study. Longitudinal studies follow people over time. They can be either prospective or retrospective. They can show how variables change and might help establish temporal relationships. But I'm not sure if they're the best for this specific question.

Option C is non-randomised controlled. These are studies where participants are assigned to groups without randomization. They can provide some evidence but are weaker than randomized controlled trials because of potential biases.

Option D is cross-sectional observational. These studies look at a population at a single point in time. They can find correlations but can't establish causation because they don't show the timeline. For example, they can say that people with more cavities eat more sugar, but not which causes which.

Option E is experimental study. Experiments, especially randomized controlled trials (RCTs), are the gold standard for determining causation because they can control variables and minimize bias. But wait, the question is about the best available evidence for association, not necessarily causation. Also, doing an RCT on sugar intake and dental caries might be feasible, but I'm not sure if that's the most common study type used for this evidence.

Option F is meta-analysis. A meta-analysis combines data from multiple studies to find a consensus. It's powerful but depends on the quality of the included studies. It's more about synthesizing evidence rather than being a study design itself.

Option G is qualitative study. These focus on understanding experiences and perspectives rather than measuring variables. Not relevant for quantifying an association between sugar and caries.

Option H is randomized controlled. This is similar to E, I think. RCTs are great for proving causation. But the question is about association evidence, so maybe a different design is better suited for that.

Option I is cohort study. Cohort studies are a type of longitudinal study where you follow a group over time, exposed vs. not exposed to a potential cause. They can show incidence and temporal relationships, making them good for establishing associations, especially in chronic diseases. So cohort studies might be a strong candidate.

Option J is ecological study. Ecological studies look at populations rather than individuals. They can show correlations between variables at a group level, but they can't confirm individual associations. They're often used for generating hypotheses.

Now, considering the question again: the best evidence for an association. Cohort studies (option I) allow for observing the development of disease over time, making temporal association stronger. They can show that higher sugar intake precedes more caries, which supports an association. 

But wait, I also remember that RCTs are considered better for establishing causality. However, the question is asking about association evidence, not causation. So for association, cohort studies are better because they can track exposure and outcome over time in a more natural setting.

Alternatively, experimental studies (E or H) could provide strong evidence of causation but might not be the best for showing association in the population, especially if the study is in a controlled environment, which might not reflect real-world exposure levels.

So, putting it all together, the best available evidence for an association (as opposed to causation) would likely come from a cohort study, which is option I.

The best available evidence for an association between the amount of sugars and the risk of dental caries comes from a **cohort study**. Cohort studies are a type of longitudinal study that follows a group of individuals over time, allowing researchers to observe the development of outcomes (e.g., dental caries) in relation to exposures (e.g., sugar intake). This design is particularly strong for establishing temporal relationships and associations because it tracks individuals prospectively, providing insights into how exposure precedes the outcome. While randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard for establishing causation, the question specifically focuses on association evidence, making cohort studies the most appropriate choice.
