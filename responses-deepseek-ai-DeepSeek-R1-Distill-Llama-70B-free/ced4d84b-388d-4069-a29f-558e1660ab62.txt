Okay, so I've got this finance problem here about dividend growth and stock pricing. Let me see if I can figure it out. Hmm, the question says a company last paid a dividend of $3. The expected return on equity is 12%, and the shares are currently priced at $75. I need to find the dividend growth rate that makes the price consistent with a growing perpetuity. The options are from A to J, but I shouldn't just jump to the options yet; I should think through the problem.

Wait, what's a growing perpetuity? Oh right, that's the Gordon Growth Model. It's used to value stocks that pay dividends which are expected to grow indefinitely at a constant rate. The formula for the stock price is P = D1 / (r - g), where D1 is next year's dividend, r is the required rate of return, and g is the growth rate of dividends.

So the current dividend, D0, is $3. That means next year's dividend, D1, would be D0 multiplied by (1 + g), right? So D1 = 3*(1 + g).

The stock price P is given as $75. The required return r is 12% or 0.12.

Putting it all into the formula: 75 = [3*(1 + g)] / (0.12 - g).

Wait, let me write that equation step by step. So,

75 = [3*(1 + g)] / (0.12 - g)

I need to solve for g.

First, multiply both sides by (0.12 - g) to get rid of the denominator.

75*(0.12 - g) = 3*(1 + g)

Let me compute 75*0.12. 75 times 0.12 is 9, right? So 75*(0.12 -g) = 9 -75g.

So the equation becomes:

9 - 75g = 3*(1 +g)

Expanding the right side, 3*1 is 3 and 3*g is 3g. So,

9 -75g = 3 + 3g

Now I'll bring all terms to one side. Subtract 3 from both sides:

6 -75g = 3g

Then, add 75g to both sides:

6 = 78g

So, g = 6/78. Let me compute that. 6 divided by 78 is 0.076923... which is approximately 7.69% but looking at the options, that's not one of them. Wait, let me check my calculations again because that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, let me go through the steps again. Maybe I made a mistake in the algebra.

Starting with the equation:

75 = [3*(1 + g)] / (0.12 -g)

Multiply both sides by (0.12 -g):

75*(0.12 -g) = 3*(1 +g)

Compute 75*0.12: yes, 9. So,

9 -75g = 3 +3g

Bring variables to one side:

9 -3 = 75g +3g

6 = 78g

So g=6/78= 0.0769... which is about 7.69%. Hmm, but none of the options are 8%—wait, option G is 8%. Oh wait, 7.69 is approximately 8%, so maybe that's the intended answer. Or perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me double-check the setup. The formula uses D1, which is next year's dividend. So D1 is 3*(1+g). The current price is the present value of D1/(r-g). So the equation is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the last dividend is D0, and D1 is the next dividend, so perhaps I should model D0 as the current dividend, and D1 = D0*(1+g). So the setup is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should solve the equation more accurately. Let's do the division properly.

6 divided by 78 equals 0.076923..., which is 7.6923%. So that's approximately 7.7%, but the options given are 8% (option G) and 6% (option B). Hmm, that's a problem. Because 7.7% isn't one of the options. So perhaps I made an error.

Wait, let me check the original question again. Oh wait, the current stock price is $75, the last dividend was $3, and the required return is 12%. Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be set up as P = D0*(1+g)/(r -g). Because sometimes the formula is written with D0 instead of D1. Wait, no, because D1 is D0*(1+g), so P = D1/(r -g) is the same as D0*(1+g)/(r -g). So the setup was correct.

Wait a minute, perhaps I messed up the equation when expanding.

Wait, 75*(0.12 -g) = 3*(1 +g)

Let me compute 75*(0.12 -g):

75 * 0.12 = 9, 75*(-g) = -75g. So left side is 9 -75g.

Right side: 3*(1 +g) = 3 + 3g.

So equation is 9 -75g = 3 +3g.

Subtract 3 from both sides: 6 -75g = 3g.

Add 75g to both sides: 6 = 78g.

So, g = 6/78 = 2/26 = 1/13 ≈ 0.0769 or 7.69%.

But none of the options are exactly 7.69%. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the formula uses the current dividend as D0, and the next period's dividend is D1 = D0*(1+g). So P = D1/(r -g) = D0*(1+g)/(r -g).

So, in this case, D0 is $3, so P = 3*(1+g)/(0.12 -g) = 75.

So 3*(1+g) = 75*(0.12 -g).

Wait, 3*(1+g) = 75*(0.12 -g).

Ah, wait, maybe I should write it as:

3*(1+g) = 75*(0.12 -g).

Wait, that's the same as before. So same equation, same result.

Hmm, but the options don't have 7.69%. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement.

Wait, the question says the shares are quoted at $75. So P is 75.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation again. Let me recompute 6/78.

6 divided by 78: 78 goes into 6 zero times. Add a decimal point, 78 goes into 60 0 times. 78 goes into 600 7 times (7*78=546), subtract 546 from 600 gives 54. Bring down a zero: 540. 78 goes into 540 6 times (6*78=468). Subtract 468 from 540 gives 72. Bring down a zero: 720. 78 goes into 720 9 times (9*78=702), remainder 18. Bring down zero: 180. 78 goes into 180 2 times (2*78=156), remainder 24. Bring down zero: 240. 78 goes into 240 3 times (3*78=234), remainder 6. Now it's repeating.

So 6/78 is 0.076923..., which is approximately 7.69%.

Looking back at the options: option G is 8%, which is the closest. But wait, the options don't have 7.69%, so perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, let me check the formula again. The Gordon Growth Model is P = D1/(r - g). So with D1 = 3*(1+g), and P=75, r=0.12.

So 75 = 3*(1+g)/(0.12 -g).

Yes, that's correct. So solving gives g ≈7.69%. But the options don't have exactly that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question expects us to approximate, but 7.69 is closer to 8% than to 6%, so option G (8%) would be the answer. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula as P = D0/(r - g). But wait, that's the formula for a perpetuity with no growth, but when there's growth, it's P = D1/(r -g) = D0*(1+g)/(r -g).

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the current dividend as D1, but that doesn't make sense because the last dividend was $3, so D1 is next year's.

Wait, maybe the question uses the formula differently. Let me check the formula again.

Another approach: the required rate of return is the dividend yield plus the growth rate. So, in equilibrium, the expected return r = (D1/P) + g.

So, r = (D1 / P) + g.

D1 is next year's dividend, which is 3*(1+g).

So, 0.12 = [3*(1+g)/75] + g.

Let me write that equation: 0.12 = [3(1+g)]/75 + g.

Simplify [3(1+g)]/75: 3/75 is 0.04, so 0.04*(1+g) = 0.04 + 0.04g.

So equation becomes:

0.12 = 0.04 + 0.04g + g.

Combine like terms: 0.04g + g = 1.04g.

So, 0.12 = 0.04 + 1.04g.

Subtract 0.04 from both sides:

0.08 = 1.04g.

So, g = 0.08 / 1.04 ≈ 0.076923 or 7.69%.

Same result as before. So again, around 7.69%, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I should choose the closest option. The closest option is G:8%. But why isn't that an option? Let me check the options again.

Options are A:0%, B:6%, C:4%, D:10%, E:-4%, F:-8%, G:8%, H:20%, I:16%, J:12%.

Ah, yes, option G is 8%, which is the closest to 7.69%. So the intended answer must be G:8%.

But wait, sometimes in such problems, they might expect an exact answer, but perhaps I made an error in the setup. Let me think if there's another way.

Wait, perhaps the formula is being used differently. What if instead, the current dividend is D0=$3, and the next year's dividend is D1= D0*(1+g) =3(1+g). Then, the value of the stock today is the present value of all future dividends, which is D1/(r -g) =75.

So, 3(1+g)/(0.12 -g)=75.

Which brings us back to the same equation, leading to g=7.69%.

Hmm, perhaps the options are rounded, and 8% is the correct choice.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should use the formula as P = D0/(r -g). But that's the case when dividends are constant, not growing. In that case, with D0=3, P=75, so 75=3/(r -g). But that would be a different approach and not the growing perpetuity. So that's probably not the right way.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the wrong formula, but I think I'm using the correct one.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute the equation.

From 75 = 3(1+g)/(0.12 -g).

Multiply both sides by (0.12 -g):

75*(0.12 -g) =3(1+g)

Compute 75*0.12=9, so 9 -75g=3(1+g)=3+3g.

Bring variables to one side: 9-3=75g +3g → 6=78g → g=6/78=1/13≈0.0769, which is 7.69%.

So, no mistake here. So the correct answer isn't among the options except G:8%, which is the closest.

Wait, perhaps the question had a typo, but assuming the options are correct, I have to choose from them. So perhaps the intended answer is 8%, which is option G.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me think: is the current price equal to the present value of next year's dividend and the growth? Yes, that's correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the formula for the expected return. The expected return (r) is equal to the dividend yield plus the growth rate.

So, r = (D1/P) + g.

We have r=12%, D1=3(1+g), P=75.

So, 0.12 = [3(1+g)/75] + g.

Compute [3(1+g)]/75 → (3/75)(1+g) = 0.04(1+g) = 0.04 + 0.04g.

So, 0.12 = 0.04 + 0.04g + g → 0.12 =0.04 + 1.04g.

Subtract 0.04: 0.08 =1.04g → g=0.08/1.04≈0.0769, same as before.

So, same result. Therefore, the correct growth rate is approximately 7.69%, but the closest option is G:8%.

I think that's the intended answer.

To determine the dividend growth rate \( g \) that ensures the stock price is consistent with the pricing of a growing perpetuity, we use the Gordon Growth Model. The formula for the stock price \( P \) is:

\[
P = \frac{D_1}{r - g}
\]

Where:
- \( P = 75 \) (current stock price),
- \( D_1 = 3(1 + g) \) (next year's dividend, based on the last dividend \( D_0 = 3 \)),
- \( r = 0.12 \) (required rate of return).

Substituting the known values into the formula:

\[
75 = \frac{3(1 + g)}{0.12 - g}
\]

First, multiply both sides by \( 0.12 - g \) to eliminate the denominator:

\[
75(0.12 - g) = 3(1 + g)
\]

Expanding both sides:

\[
9 - 75g = 3 + 3g
\]

Rearranging terms to isolate \( g \):

\[
9 - 3 = 75g + 3g
\]

\[
6 = 78g
\]

Solving for \( g \):

\[
g = \frac{6}{78} \approx 0.0769 \, \text{or} \, 7.69\%
\]

The calculated growth rate is approximately \( 7.69\% \). However, this value is not one of the provided options. The closest option to \( 7.69\% \) is \( 8\% \), which corresponds to option \( G \).

Thus, the dividend growth rate that ensures the stock price is consistent with the pricing of a growing perpetuity is approximately \( 8\% \).
