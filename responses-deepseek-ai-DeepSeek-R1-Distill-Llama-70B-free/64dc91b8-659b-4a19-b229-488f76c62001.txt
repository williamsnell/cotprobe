Okay, so I've got this problem here about making soda-lime glass for wine bottles. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The manufacturer wants to make 5000 wine bottles, each weighing 400 grams. I need to find out how many grams of sand (SiO2) are required.

Wait, the chemical equation is given. It's Na2CO3 + CaCO3 + 6SiO2 → Na2O·CaO·6SiO2 + 2CO2. So the products are soda-lime glass and carbon dioxide. I'm guessing the glass is the Na2O·CaO·6SiO2 part.

So each bottle is made of this glass, and each weighs 400g. I need to find the total weight of the glass needed for 5000 bottles. Then, from the chemical equation, figure out how much SiO2 is needed per mole of glass, and then calculate the mass.

First, let's find the total mass of glass needed. 5000 bottles times 400g each. 5000 * 400 = 2,000,000 grams. So 2e6 grams of glass.

Now, what's the molar mass of the glass compound? The glass is Na2O·CaO·6SiO2. Let me break that down.

Na2O: Sodium has a molar mass of about 23, so 2*23 = 46. Oxygen is 16, so 16. So Na2O is 46 + 16 = 62 g/mol.

CaO: Calcium is 40, oxygen 16. So 56 g/mol.

6SiO2: Each SiO2 has a molar mass of (28 for Si) + (16*2)=32. So 60 g/mol per SiO2. Multiply by 6, that's 6*60=360 g/mol.

Adding them all together: 62 (Na2O) +56 (CaO) +360 (6SiO2) = 62+56=118, 118+360=478 g/mol.

So each mole of glass weighs 478 grams.

Wait, but I need to find how many moles are in 2e6 grams of glass. Moles = mass / molar mass. So 2e6 g / 478 g/mol. Let me calculate that.

Wait, let me compute 2,000,000 divided by 478. Let me approximate. 478 is about 480. 480 * 4 = 1920, which is 4000 moles would be 1,920,000 grams. Hmm, maybe exact calculation is better.

Let me do 2e6 / 478.

Well, 478 * 4184 = let's see. 478 * 4000 = 1,912,000. 478 * 184 = let's see. 478 * 100=47,800; 478*80=38,240; 478*4=1,912. So 47,800+38,240=86,040 +1,912=87,952. So 1,912,000 +87,952=2,000, (wait 1,912,000 +87,952 is 1,999,952. So approximately 4184 moles, because 4184 *478 = 1,999,952, which is nearly 2e6. So about 4184 moles.

Now, looking back at the chemical equation, for each mole of glass produced, how many moles of SiO2 are used? The equation shows 6 moles of SiO2 are used per mole of glass. Because the reactants are 1 Na2CO3, 1 CaCO3, 6 SiO2, producing 1 mole of glass and 2 moles of CO2.

So per mole of glass, 6 moles of SiO2 are needed. So total moles of SiO2 needed is 6 * 4184 ≈ 25,104 moles.

Wait, but wait, no, actually, I think I messed up. Because the glass is made from 6SiO2 in the reactants. So for each mole of glass, 6 moles of SiO2 are consumed. So yes, correct.

Now, calculate the mass of SiO2 needed. The molar mass of SiO2 is 28 (Si) + 16*2 (O) = 60 g/mol.

So 25,104 moles * 60 g/mol = ?

Let me compute that.

25,104 * 60. Let's see, 25,104 * 6 = 150,624, so 60 is 10 times that, so 1,506,240 grams. Wait, wait, 25,104 * 60 = (25,104 * 6) *10.

Wait 25,104 *6: 25,000 *6=150,000; 104*6=624. So 150,624. Multiply by 10 gives 1,506,240 grams.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are in terms of 1e5 or 1e6. Let's see, 1.5e6 grams is 1,500,000, which is close to 1,506,240. So the closest option would be option F: 1.75e6, or maybe option D: 1.51e6.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 2e6 grams of glass divided by 478 g/mol gives 2e6/478 = approximately 4183.78 moles.

Then, 4183.78 moles multiplied by 6 = 25,102.7 moles of SiO2.

Each mole of SiO2 is 60 g, so 25,102.7 * 60 = ?

Let me compute 25,102.7 *60.

25,000 *60 = 1,500,000.

102.7 *60 = 6,162.

So total is 1,506,162 grams.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.51e6, which is 1,510,000. My calculation is 1,506,162, which is about 1.506e6, so 1.51e6 would be option D. Wait, but wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 1.0 ×10^6 g

B:3.5 ×10^5

C:5.0 ×10^5

D:1.51 ×10^6

E:2.51 ×10^4

F:1.75 ×10^6

G:2.5 ×10^5

H:3.0 ×10^6

I:2.0 ×10^6

J:4.18 ×10^3

So my calculation is approximately 1.506e6, which is very close to option D (1.51e6). So the correct answer should be D.

Wait, but wait another step. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in calculations. Let me recheck.

Total glass mass: 5000 * 400 = 2,000,000 g.

Molar mass of glass: Na2O·CaO·6SiO2.

Na2O: 2*23 +16=62.

CaO:40 +16=56.

6SiO2:6*(28+32)=6*60=360.

Total:62+56=118 +360=478 g/mol.

Moles of glass: 2e6 /478 = approx 4183.78.

Moles of SiO2: 6 * moles of glass = 6 *4183.78 ≈25,102.68.

Mass of SiO2: 25,102.68 *60 = 1,506,160.8 grams.

Which is approximately 1.506e6 grams. So the closest option is D:1.51e6.

So the answer is D.

To determine how many grams of sand (SiO₂) are required to make 5000 wine bottles, each weighing 400 g, we start by calculating the total mass of glass needed:

\[
\text{Total mass of glass} = 5000 \, \text{bottles} \times 400 \, \text{g/bottle} = 2,000,000 \, \text{g}.
\]

The chemical equation for the reaction is:

\[
\text{Na}_2\text{CO}_3 + \text{CaCO}_3 + 6\text{SiO}_2 \rightarrow \text{Na}_2\text{O} \cdot \text{CaO} \cdot 6\text{SiO}_2 + 2\text{CO}_2.
\]

From the equation, 1 mole of soda-lime glass (\(\text{Na}_2\text{O} \cdot \text{CaO} \cdot 6\text{SiO}_2\)) is produced, and 6 moles of SiO₂ are required. The molar mass of the glass is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Molar mass of glass} = \text{Na}_2\text{O} + \text{CaO} + 6\text{SiO}_2 = 62 + 56 + 360 = 478 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

The number of moles of glass required is:

\[
\text{Moles of glass} = \frac{\text{Total mass of glass}}{\text{Molar mass of glass}} = \frac{2,000,000}{478} \approx 4183.78 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Since 6 moles of SiO₂ are needed per mole of glass, the total moles of SiO₂ required are:

\[
\text{Moles of SiO}_2 = 6 \times 4183.78 \approx 25,102.68 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The molar mass of SiO₂ is:

\[
\text{Molar mass of SiO}_2 = 28 + (16 \times 2) = 60 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

The total mass of SiO₂ required is:

\[
\text{Mass of SiO}_2 = 25,102.68 \, \text{mol} \times 60 \, \text{g/mol} = 1,506,160.8 \, \text{g}.
\]

This value is approximately \(1.51 \times 10^6 \, \text{g}\), which corresponds to option **D**.
