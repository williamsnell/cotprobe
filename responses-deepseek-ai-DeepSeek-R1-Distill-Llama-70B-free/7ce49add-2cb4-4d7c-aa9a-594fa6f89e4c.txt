Question:

Diagnosis of iron deficiency can be complicated by concurrent infection since many markers of iron status are altered by infection. Which of the following combinations of iron status markers is likely to be found in a person with both iron deficiency and a severe infection?


Options:

A: Low haemoglobin, low ferritin, normal serum transferrin receptors, high hepcidin
B: Low haemoglobin, high ferritin, low serum transferrin receptors, low hepcidin
C: Normal haemoglobin, high ferritin, high serum transferrin receptors, low hepcidin
D: Low haemoglobin, high ferritin, normal serum transferrin receptors, low hepcidin
E: Low haemoglobin, low ferritin, high serum transferrin receptors, low hepcidin
F: High haemoglobin, high ferritin, high serum transferrin receptors, high hepcidin
G: Low haemoglobin, high ferritin, high serum transferrin receptors, high hepcidin
H: Low haemoglobin, low ferritin, low serum transferrin receptors, high hepcidin
I: High haemoglobin, low ferritin, low serum transferrin receptors, high hepcidin
J: Normal haemoglobin, low ferritin, high serum transferrin receptors, high hepcidin

Okay, so I have this question about iron deficiency and infection. Hmm, I remember that when someone has an infection, it affects iron status markers. Let me think through this.

Iron deficiency usually shows low ferritin because ferritin reflects body stores. But in infection, especially inflammation, ferritin goes up because it's an acute phase reactant. So ferritin is high when there's inflammation regardless of iron status. That might complicate things.

Hemoglobin would be low in iron deficiency anemia, but infection can cause anemia too, like anemia of chronic disease. So the person's Hb is probably low here.

Serum transferrin receptors (sTfR) are typically high in iron deficiency because the body tries to absorb more iron. But wait, in cases where there's inflammation, does that affect sTfR? I think sTfR isn't affected much by inflammation, so it remains a good marker for iron deficiency even when someone is sick. So if the person has iron deficiency, their sTfR should be high.

Hepcidin is a hormone that regulates iron absorption. In infection or inflammation, hepcidin levels go up. High hepcidin means less iron is absorbed and less is released from stores. So in this case, hepcidin would be high because of the infection.

Putting it together: the person has both iron deficiency and severe infection.

Iron deficiency would cause low ferritin if it's pure deficiency, but infection increases ferritin. So which effect is stronger? Wait, no: in iron deficiency, ferritin is low, but when there's an infection, ferritin is high. But if someone is already iron deficient, maybe their ferritin doesn't go as high as someone with adequate stores. Wait, no: ferritin is an acute phase reactant, so even if someone is iron deficient, inflammation can cause ferritin to rise. So when both are present, ferritin might be high because of the infection, masking the iron deficiency.

Wait, but if the body's iron stores are low (iron deficiency), ferritin would be low. But infection causes ferritin to increase. So what happens when both are present? I think in such cases, ferritin might be within normal or elevated. So the correct scenario would have high ferritin because of infection, regardless of iron deficiency.

So the markers:

- Hemoglobin is low (because of iron deficiency and possible anemia of chronic disease).
- Ferritin is high (due to infection).
- sTfR is high (because iron deficiency is present, as the body is trying to absorb more iron).
- Hepcidin is high (due to infection).

Looking at the options, which one matches this?

Option G: Low Hb, high ferritin, high sTfR, high hepcidin.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option G is: Low haemoglobin, high ferritin, high serum transferrin receptors, high hepcidin.

Yes, that fits. So the correct answer should be option G.

Wait, but another thought: some sources say that in anemia of chronic disease, sTfR is normal or low, but when there's concurrent iron deficiency, sTfR is high. So yeah, sTfR serves to distinguish between the two.

So the scenario here is both conditions: the ferritin is high (due to infection), but the sTfR is high (due to iron deficiency), so G is correct.

When diagnosing iron deficiency in the presence of a severe infection, it is important to consider how infection alters iron status markers. Ferritin, an acute phase reactant, increases during inflammation, which can mask iron deficiency. Hemoglobin is typically low in both iron deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease. Serum transferrin receptors (sTfR) are less affected by inflammation and remain elevated in iron deficiency, making them a reliable marker. Hepcidin, which regulates iron absorption, is also elevated during infection due to inflammation.

In this scenario, the combination of markers would be:

- **Low hemoglobin**: Due to anemia from iron deficiency and/or infection.
- **High ferritin**: Due to the acute phase response caused by infection.
- **High serum transferrin receptors**: Reflecting iron deficiency.
- **High hepcidin**: Due to inflammation from infection.

The correct option that matches these findings is:

**G: Low haemoglobin, high ferritin, high serum transferrin receptors, high hepcidin.**
