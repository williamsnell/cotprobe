Question:

The principal of a school is interested in estimating the average income per family of her students. She selects a random sample of students and collects information about their family income. A 95 percent confidence interval computed from this data for the mean income per family is ($35,095, $45,005). Which of the following provides the best interpretation of this confidence interval?

Options:

A: 95 percent of the students in her school are from families whose income is between $35,095 and $45,005.
B: If we were to take another sample of the same size and compute a 95 percent confidence interval, we would have a 95% chance of getting a different interval.
C: If we were to take another sample of the same size and compute a 95 percent confidence interval, we would have a 95% chance of getting the interval ($35,095, $45,005).
D: There is a 95% probability that the mean income per family in the school is between $35,095 and $45,005.
E: 95 percent of the income per family in the school falls between $35,095 and $45,005.
F: There is a 95% probability that the median income per family in the school is between $35,095 and $45,005.
G: There is a 95% probability that the sample mean income per family in the school is between $35,095 and $45,005.
H: The average income per family of all the students in the school is definitely between $35,095 and $45,005.
I: There is a 95% probability that the minimum income per family in the school is between $35,095 and $45,005.
J: There is a 95% probability that the families of all the students in this school have an income of between $35,095 and $45,005.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this confidence interval question. Let me start by recalling what a confidence interval means. I remember that a confidence interval gives a range of values which is likely to include the true population parameter. The number before the percent (here, 95%) is the confidence level, which is the probability that the interval will contain the parameter if we were to take many samples.

The question says the principal took a random sample of students and computed a 95% CI for the mean income, which is ($35,095, $45,005). I need to pick the correct interpretation from the options A to J.

Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: 95% of students have income in that range. Wait, no. The CI is about the mean income, not individual data points. So it's not about each student's family income, but the average. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: If we take another sample, 95% chance of a different interval. Hmm. I think each sample would give a different CI, but the 95% is about capturing the true mean, not the probability of the interval changing. So B doesn't seem right. Because each new sample's CI could be different, but the confidence is about the mean, not the interval itself.

Option C: 95% chance of getting the exact same interval again. That doesn't sound right. Each time you sample, the CI will vary. The 95% is about the mean being in the interval, not the interval being the same each time. So C is incorrect.

Option D: 95% probability that the mean is between those values. This sounds correct because the CI is a range estimated to contain the population mean. So D looks good.

Option E: 95% of families' income in the school is between those numbers. No, that's similar to A. The CI is for the mean, not individual family incomes. So E is wrong.

Option F: 95% probability for the median. No, the CI was computed for the mean, not the median. So F is incorrect.

Option G: 95% probability that the sample mean is in that range. Wait, no. The sample mean is a single value from the sample data. The CI is about the population mean, not the sample. So G is wrong.

Option H: The average is definitely in that range. No, because it's a probability, not a certainty. So H is incorrect.

Option I: 95% for the minimum income. No, the CI is about the mean, not the minimum. So I is wrong.

Option J: 95% that all families have income in that range. No, that's the same mistake as A and E. It's about the mean, not each family. So J is wrong.

So the correct answer should be D. It correctly states that there's a 95% probability the true mean falls within that interval.

The question asks for the correct interpretation of a 95% confidence interval ($35,095, $45,005) for the mean income per family in the school. A confidence interval provides a range of values within which the true population parameter is likely to lie, based on the confidence level (95% in this case). This means there is a 95% probability that the true population mean falls within the specified range, assuming repeated sampling.

Letâ€™s analyze the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The confidence interval pertains to the mean income, not individual family incomes. It does not imply that 95% of students are from families within that income range.
- **B**: Incorrect. While it is true that different samples produce different confidence intervals, the 95% probability refers to the likelihood of the interval containing the true population mean, not the probability of obtaining a different interval.
- **C**: Incorrect. The 95% probability refers to the interval containing the true mean, not the likelihood of obtaining the exact same interval again.
- **D**: Correct. This option accurately states that there is a 95% probability that the true mean income per family in the school lies between $35,095 and $45,005.
- **E**: Incorrect. Similar to A, this misinterprets the confidence interval as applying to individual family incomes rather than the mean.
- **F**: Incorrect. The confidence interval was computed for the mean, not the median.
- **G**: Incorrect. The sample mean is a single value and is not the focus of the confidence interval, which is about the population mean.
- **H**: Incorrect. The confidence interval does not provide certainty; it provides a probabilistic range.
- **I**: Incorrect. The confidence interval pertains to the mean, not the minimum income.
- **J**: Incorrect. This misinterprets the confidence interval as applying to all families, rather than the mean income.

The correct interpretation is **D**, as it accurately reflects the probabilistic nature of the confidence interval for the population mean. 

Answer: D
