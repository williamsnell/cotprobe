Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about residuals in a standard regression model. I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

Residuals, as I remember from my statistics class, are related to the differences between observed and predicted values. Let me try to recall. In regression analysis, we have a model that tries to predict the value of Y based on X. So for each data point, we calculate the predicted Y, which is often denoted as y-hat.

Now, the residual is the difference between what actually happened (the actual Y value) and what the model predicted (y-hat). So residual = y - y-hat. That makes sense because residuals show how far off each prediction was from the actual value.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's the difference between actual y and y-hat. That matches what I was just thinking.

Option B is the square of that difference. Wait, isn't that the squared residual? I think squared terms are used in calculating things like the sum of squared residuals, which is part of the ordinary least squares method. But the residual itself isn't squared, just the difference.

Option C is the square between y-hat and y-bar. Y-bar is the mean of the actual Y values. That sounds more like something related to the total sum of squares or maybe something else, but not the residual.

Option D is the difference between y-hat and y-bar. Again, that doesn't sound right for a residual. That's more about how the predicted value compares to the mean, maybe in some other context.

Option E is the sum of y and y-hat. That doesn't make sense for a residual; residuals are about the error, so adding them wouldn't fit.

Option F talks about standard deviation and y-hat. I don't think residuals involve standard deviation directly. Standard deviation is more of a spread measure, not the residual itself.

Option G is the difference between y and y-bar. Oh wait, that's the deviation from the mean. That's used in calculating variance and standard deviation. But that's not the residual because the residual is model-dependent, comparing y to y-hat, not to the mean.

Option H is the difference between y and the median. That's not right either. The median is a measure of central tendency, but residuals are about each point's difference from the model's prediction.

Option I is the square root of the difference between y and y-hat. That would be the absolute value of the residual, but residuals themselves can be positive or negative, right? So taking the square root would just give the magnitude, but they're not defined that way.

So putting it all together, the residual is simply the actual value minus the fitted value. So the correct answer should be option A.

The residual in a standard regression model is the difference between the actual observed value \( y \) and the value predicted by the model \( \hat{y} \). This is mathematically expressed as:

\[
\text{Residual} = y - \hat{y}
\]

Analyzing the options provided:

- **Option A** correctly defines the residual as the difference between the actual value \( y \) and the fitted value \( \hat{y} \).
- **Option B** refers to the squared residual, which is used in calculations like the sum of squared residuals but is not the definition of the residual itself.
- **Option C** involves the square of the difference between \( \hat{y} \) and the mean \( \bar{y} \), which is unrelated to the residual.
- **Option D** describes the difference between \( \hat{y} \) and \( \bar{y} \), which is not the residual.
- **Option E** suggests the sum of \( y \) and \( \hat{y} \), which is incorrect.
- **Option F** mentions standard deviation and \( \hat{y} \), which is unrelated to the residual.
- **Option G** refers to the deviation from the mean, not the residual.
- **Option H** involves the median, which is irrelevant to the definition of a residual.
- **Option I** describes the square root of the difference, which would represent the absolute value of the residual, not the residual itself.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**.
