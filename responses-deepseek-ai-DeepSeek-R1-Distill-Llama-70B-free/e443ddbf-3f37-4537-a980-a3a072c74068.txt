Question:

A 15-year-old girl is brought to the physician 3 months after she had a blood pressure of 150/95 mm Hg at a routine examination prior to participation in school sports. She is asymptomatic and has no history of serious illness. Twelve months ago, she was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection and treated with oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She currently takes no medications. Subsequent blood pressure measurements on three separate occasions since the last visit have been: 155/94 mm Hg, 145/90 mm Hg, and 150/92 mm Hg. She is at the 50th percentile for height and 95th percentile for weight. Her blood pressure today is 150/90 mm Hg confirmed by a second measurement, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 12/min. Examination shows no other abnormalities. Her hematocrit is 40%. Urinalysis is within normal limits. Cardiac and renal ultrasonography shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:

A: Measurement of serum potassium levels
B: Measurement of urine corticosteroid concentrations
C: Exercise and weight reduction program
D: Captopril therapy
E: Initiate diuretic therapy
F: Referral for psychiatric evaluation
G: Initiate calcium channel blocker therapy
H: Measurement of urine catecholamine concentrations
I: Measurement of plasma renin activity
J: Initiate beta-blocker therapy

Okay, so I have this question about a 15-year-old girl with elevated blood pressure. Let me try to break it down step by step.

So, the girl is asymptomatic and had a blood pressure of 150/95 mm Hg three months ago during a routine exam for school sports. They took her again on three separate occasions and her BP was 155/94, 145/90, and 150/92 mm Hg. Today, it's 150/90, confirmed with a second measurement. Her pulse is 80, respirations 12, which seem normal. She's at the 50th percentile for height but 95th for weight, so she's a bit overweight.

Her lab work: hematocrit is 40%, which is normal. Urinalysis is normal, so no issues there like protein or blood. Cardiac and renal ultrasounds are normal, so no structural issues with kidneys or heart. She doesn't take any medications now but had trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole a year ago for a UTI.

So the question is about the next step in management. The options are various tests or treatments.

I remember that in pediatric patients, high blood pressure can be primary (essential) or secondary. Since she's in the 95th percentile for weight, maybe her weight is contributing. But her age is 15, so she could be in the early stages of hypertension.

The first thing that comes to mind is that in children, especially if they're overweight, the first approach is often lifestyle modifications rather than jumping into medications. Because medications have side effects and lifestyle changes can sometimes manage the issue effectively.

Looking at the options:

A: Serum potassium. That's often checked in cases of suspected secondary hypertension, like renal issues or hormonal causes. Her urinalysis is normal, but maybe if they suspect something like hyperaldosteronism, they'd check potassium. But she doesn't have any symptoms pointing to that right now.

B: Urine corticosteroid concentrations. That's more for Cushing's syndrome or other adrenal issues. Again, unless there are signs like weight gain, buffalo hump, etc., which aren't mentioned here.

C: Exercise and weight reduction. This seems relevant because she's overweight, and lifestyle changes are first-line for hypertension, especially in adolescents without severe symptoms.

D: Captopril. That's an ACE inhibitor, used in hypertension, but usually after lifestyle changes unless BP is very high. Her BP is around 150/90, which is stage 1 hypertension in adults, but for adolescents, the thresholds are different. Wait, I think in pediatrics, the BP percentiles matter. Let me recall: For adolescents, the 95th percentile is considered elevated, and above that is stage 1 or 2. Her BP is 150/90, but what's the normal for her age and height?

Hmm, normal BP for a 15-year-old girl—I think it's lower. For example, for a 15-year-old, systolic around 120 or less is normal. So 150 would be elevated. But I'm not certain about the exact percentiles. Anyway, moving on.

E: Diuretic therapy. That's another medication option, but again, more for when lifestyle fails.

F: Psychiatric evaluation. Unless she's having mental health issues causing stress, but nothing in the history suggests that. She's asymptomatic.

G: Calcium channel blocker. Another medication option. But again, probably not the first step.

H: Urine catecholamines. That's for pheochromocytoma or other catecholamine excess. If she had episodes of hypertension with headaches or palpitations, maybe. But she's asymptomatic, so less likely.

I: Plasma renin activity. That's used in diagnosing causes of hypertension, like Renal artery stenosis or other renin-related issues. But without other signs, maybe it's not the first step.

J: Beta-blocker. Again, a medication option.

So putting it all together. The girl's BP is consistently elevated, but she's asymptomatic. Her workup so far shows no signs of secondary causes—urinalysis normal, renal ultrasound normal, no meds. She's overweight, which could be contributing. 

In pediatrics, the first approach to hypertension, especially if it's primary or related to obesity, is lifestyle modification. So option C is likely the correct next step.

Wait, but what about the possibility of white coat hypertension? Well, she had multiple measurements over three visits, so it's likely sustained hypertension, not white coat.

So the management would be lifestyle changes: weight loss, exercise, low-sodium diet, etc. So the next step is initiating an exercise and weight reduction program.

The 15-year-old girl has consistently elevated blood pressure (BP) measurements, including 150/90 mm Hg today, confirmed on multiple occasions. She is asymptomatic, overweight (95th percentile for weight), and has no history of serious illness or current medications. Her urinalysis, hematocrit, and cardiac and renal ultrasonography are all normal, indicating no evidence of secondary hypertension or structural abnormalities. Given her age and weight status, her elevated BP is likely related to her weight, and she does not exhibit symptoms suggestive of secondary causes of hypertension.

In pediatric patients with hypertension, particularly when it is likely related to weight, the first-line approach is lifestyle modification rather than immediate pharmacotherapy. This includes an exercise and weight reduction program, dietary changes, and other non-pharmacological interventions. While further diagnostic testing (e.g., serum potassium, urine catecholamines) could be considered if secondary hypertension were suspected, there are no specific indicators of such conditions in this case. Similarly, initiating medications like ACE inhibitors, diuretics, calcium channel blockers, or beta-blockers would not be appropriate as the first step without attempting lifestyle changes.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to recommend an exercise and weight reduction program to address her elevated blood pressure.
