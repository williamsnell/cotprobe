Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again.

The problem says that we have a one-particle, one-dimensional system with a given state function Ψ. The state is a combination of two terms, each involving sine and cosine functions of time. The variables a and c are given, with c being 2.000 Å. The question is about finding the probability of the particle's position being between 2.000 Å and 2.001 Å when measured at t=0.

Alright, so first, I need to recall some basic concepts about wave functions and probabilities. The probability of finding a particle in a certain region is the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over that region. Since the position is measured at t=0, I should evaluate Ψ at t=0 and then find the probability density there.

Let me look at the given Ψ:

Ψ = (sin a t) * [2/(π c²)]^{1/4} e^{-x²/c²} + (cos a t) * [32/(π c^6)]^{1/4} x e^{-x²/c²}

At t=0, sin(a*0)=0 and cos(a*0)=1. So, the first term becomes zero, and the second term simplifies. So Ψ(t=0) is just the second part.

So Ψ(0) = [32/(π c^6)]^{1/4} * x e^{-x²/c²}

I can rewrite this for clarity. Let me compute the coefficients.

First, let's compute the normalization factors. The first term's coefficient is [2/(π c²)]^{1/4}. Wait, but at t=0, the first term is zero, so I don't need to worry about it. The second term's coefficient is [32/(π c^6)]^{1/4}.

Let me compute [32/(π c^6)]^{1/4}. Let's plug c=2.000 Å.

Wait, c is 2.000 Å. So c^2 is (2)^2 =4, and c^6 is 64.

So 32/(π c^6) = 32/(π *64) = (32/64)/π = (1/2)/π = 1/(2π).

So [1/(2π)]^{1/4} is the coefficient.

Wait, wait a second. Let me compute that correctly. So 32/(π c^6) when c=2 is 32/(π*(64)) )= 32/(64 π) )= 1/(2 π).

So the coefficient is [1/(2π)]^{1/4}.

Hmm. Then the wavefunction at t=0 is [1/(2π)]^{1/4} * x * e^{-x²/c²}.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the probability density at x between 2 and 2.001 Å. So I need to compute |Ψ(0)|² dx over that interval.

But wait, the probability is the integral of |Ψ|² dx from 2.000 to 2.001 Å. Since the interval is very narrow (only 0.001 Å wide), I can approximate this by |Ψ(2)|² multiplied by the width (0.001 Å). That is, the probability ≈ |Ψ(2)|² * Δx.

So, first, compute |Ψ(0)|². That's [ (32/(π c^6))^{1/4} * x e^{-x²/c²} ] squared.

Wait, Ψ is a sum of two terms, but at t=0, only the second term remains. So |Ψ|² is the square of the second term.

So |Ψ|² = [ (32/(π c^6))^{1/4} ]^2 * x² * e^{-2x²/c²}.

Simplify that: [32/(π c^6)]^{1/2} * x² e^{-2x²/c²}.

Wait, [ (a)^{1/4} ]^2 is a^{1/2}.

So that's sqrt(32/(π c^6)) ) * x² e^{-2x²/(c^2)}.

Wait, but let me compute that coefficient. 32/(π c^6) is 32/(π*(2)^6) = 32/(64 π) = 1/(2 π) as before. So sqrt(1/(2 π)) is 1/sqrt(2 π).

So the coefficient is 1/sqrt(2 π).

So |Ψ(0)|² = [1/sqrt(2 π)] * x² e^{-2x²/(c²)}.

But wait, c is 2. So c²=4. So the exponent is -2x²/(4)= -x²/2.

So |Ψ(0)|² = (1/sqrt(2 π)) * x² e^{-x²/(2)}.

But wait, let me double-check that. Oh wait, because 2x²/c² where c²=4 is 2x²/(4) = x²/2. So the exponent is -x²/(2).

Wait, no, wait again. The original exponent in the second term is -x²/c². So when squared, because |a e^{-b}|² = a² e^{-2b}, so the exponent becomes -2x²/(c²). So yes, with c=2, that's -2x²/(4) = -x²/2. So yes, the exponent is correct.

So the probability density is (1/sqrt(2 π)) x² e^{-x²/(2)}.

Now, I need to evaluate this at x = 2.000 Å. Then multiply by the interval width, which is 0.001 Å, to approximate the integral.

Wait, but the interval is from 2.000 to 2.001. So the midpoint is at 2.0005, but since the interval is small, the variation is negligible, so evaluating at x=2.000 is a good approximation.

So let me compute the value at x=2.

Compute x²: (2)^2 =4.

e^{-x²/2} = e^{-4/2}=e^{-2} ≈ 0.1353.

So then the probability density is (1/sqrt(2 π)) *4 * 0.1353.

Compute 4 * 0.1353 = 0.5412.

Now, 1/sqrt(2 π) is approximately 1/(2.5066) ≈ 0.3989.

So 0.3989 * 0.5412 ≈ 0.216.

Wait, 0.3989 * 0.5412. Let me compute that. 0.4 * 0.54 is 0.216. But more accurately:

0.3989 * 0.5412 = let's compute 0.3989 * 0.5 is 0.19945, and 0.3989 * 0.0412 ≈ 0.0164, so total approx 0.2158.

So the probability density at x=2 is approximately 0.2158 per Å.

Now, the width is 0.001 Å, so the probability is roughly 0.2158 * 0.001 = 0.0002158.

Looking at the options, option H is 0.000216, which is very close.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, when I calculated |Ψ|^2, I considered the square of the coefficient. Let me recheck:

The coefficient before x e^{-x²/c²} is [32/(π c^6)]^{1/4}.

At c=2, 32/(π*(2)^6) =32/(64 π)=1/(2 π).

So [1/(2 π)]^{1/4} is the coefficient. So when squared, it's [1/(2 π)]^{1/2} = 1/sqrt(2 π), which is correct.

Then, the term x e^{-x²/c²} squared becomes x² e^{-2x²/c²}.

At x=2, c=2. So x² is 4, e^{-2*(4)/(4)}=e^{-2}.

So 4 e^{-2} is correct.

So the coefficient is (1/sqrt(2 π)) * 4 e^{-2}.

Wait another point: when I compute 1/sqrt(2 π), that's approximately 0.3989, yes.

So 0.3989 *4 =1.5956, then multiply by e^{-2} ≈0.1353.

So 1.5956 * 0.1353 ≈ 0.216, yes.

So yes, the approximate probability is 0.000216 when multiplied by 0.001.

Looking back at the options, option H is 0.000216. So that's the answer.

To determine the probability of finding the particle between \( x = 2.000 \, \text{Å} \) and \( x = 2.001 \, \text{Å} \) at \( t = 0 \), we start by analyzing the given wave function:

\[
\Psi = (\sin a t) \left( \frac{2}{\pi c^2} \right)^{1/4} e^{-x^2 / c^2} + (\cos a t) \left( \frac{32}{\pi c^6} \right)^{1/4} x e^{-x^2 / c^2}.
\]

At \( t = 0 \), \( \sin(0) = 0 \) and \( \cos(0) = 1 \), so the wave function simplifies to:

\[
\Psi(0) = \left( \frac{32}{\pi c^6} \right)^{1/4} x e^{-x^2 / c^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute the normalization coefficient
The coefficient is given by \( \left( \frac{32}{\pi c^6} \right)^{1/4} \). Substituting \( c = 2.000 \, \text{Å} \), we find:

\[
\frac{32}{\pi c^6} = \frac{32}{\pi (2)^6} = \frac{32}{64 \pi} = \frac{1}{2 \pi}.
\]

Thus, the coefficient becomes:

\[
\left( \frac{1}{2 \pi} \right)^{1/4}.
\]

### Step 2: Probability density
The probability density is \( |\Psi(0)|^2 \), which is the square of the wave function:

\[
|\Psi(0)|^2 = \left( \frac{1}{2 \pi} \right)^{1/2} x^2 e^{-2x^2 / c^2}.
\]

Substituting \( c = 2.000 \, \text{Å} \), we have \( c^2 = 4 \), so the exponent becomes \( -2x^2 / 4 = -x^2 / 2 \). Therefore:

\[
|\Psi(0)|^2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} x^2 e^{-x^2 / 2}.
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate at \( x = 2.000 \, \text{Å} \)
At \( x = 2.000 \, \text{Å} \), \( x^2 = 4 \), and \( e^{-x^2 / 2} = e^{-2} \approx 0.1353 \). Substituting these values:

\[
|\Psi(0)|^2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} (4) (0.1353).
\]

First, compute \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \approx 0.3989 \). Then:

\[
|\Psi(0)|^2 \approx 0.3989 \cdot 4 \cdot 0.1353 \approx 0.216.
\]

### Step 4: Approximate the probability
The probability of finding the particle in the narrow interval \( [2.000, 2.001] \, \text{Å} \) is approximately:

\[
P \approx |\Psi(0)|^2 \cdot \Delta x = 0.216 \cdot 0.001 = 0.000216.
\]

### Final Answer
Comparing this result to the options provided, the closest match is:

**H: 0.000216**

\boxed{H}
