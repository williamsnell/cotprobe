Okay, so I've got this question about the global prevalence of untreated dental caries. Hmm, I remember that dental caries is a pretty common issue worldwide. But I'm not exactly sure about the exact percentage. Let me think.

I recall that dental caries, also known as tooth decay, is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases globally. I think the World Health Organization (WHO) has some data on this. I remember reading that a significant portion of the population has untreated caries. 

Wait, was it around 60% or so? Or maybe higher? I'm trying to remember. Oh, right, I think it's something like 60-90% of schoolchildren and a large portion of adults. But the question is about the global prevalence overall, not just children.

So, if I'm considering the entire global population, including both children and adults, what's the estimate? I think it's around 35-40%, but wait, that doesn't match the options given. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options: A is 30%, B 10%, C 70%, D 60%, E 20%, F 50%, G 100%, H 90%, I 40%, J 80%. So the options are in 10% increments.

Wait, I think the global prevalence is estimated to be about 35-40%, but maybe the commonly cited figure is around 30-40%. But looking at the options, 30% is A, 40% is I. So which one is closer?

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing it up with another statistic. I remember that over 90% of adults have some form of dental caries, treated or untreated, but the question is specifically about untreated cases.

Oh, right! The global prevalence of untreated dental caries is estimated to be around 35% or so. But I'm not sure if that's the exact figure. Alternatively, I might have read that it's about 30% of the global population. Wait, no, that might be for another condition.

Alternatively, perhaps it's higher. Let me think again. I remember a study or report stating that approximately 2.4 billion people have untreated caries in their permanent teeth, and another 500 million children have them in their primary teeth. So that's a total of around 3 billion people. The global population is about 7.9 billion, so 3/7.9 is roughly 38%. That's close to 40%, so option I is 40%.

Wait, but the question says "estimated global prevalence," so it's a percentage. So if 3 billion out of 7.9 billion have untreated caries, that's about 38%, which would round to 40% as option I.

But I'm a bit unsure because sometimes the statistics can vary. Another thought: I've heard that in many low-income countries, the prevalence is higher, while in high-income countries, it's lower but still significant. So the global average might be around 35-40%.

Wait, but I'm looking at the options again. Option I is 40%, which is close to my calculation. Alternatively, option F is 50%, which would be higher than my estimate.

Wait, perhaps I'm conflating total caries (treated and untreated) with untreated. Because if 90% have caries, but many are treated, then the untreated might be lower. So maybe the untreated is around 35-40%, which would point to option I, 40%.

Alternatively, I've read somewhere that globally, about 30% of the population has untreated caries. That would be option A. Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Wait, I think the correct figure is approximately 35%, but the options don't have 35, so the closest would be 30% or 40%. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 60%, but I don't think that's right.

Wait, another angle: the global burden of untreated dental caries is a major issue. I think the WHO says that 2.4 billion people have untreated caries in permanent teeth, and 486 million children have untreated caries in primary teeth. Adding those together gives about 2.88 billion people. Let's calculate the percentage: 2.88 billion out of 7.9 billion is roughly 36.5%. So around 36.5%, which would be closest to 40% (option I), but perhaps the options are rounded. Or maybe the question refers to a different statistic.

Alternatively, perhaps the global prevalence is around 30%, making option A correct. I'm a bit torn here.

Wait, another thought: I remember that the prevalence of untreated caries in permanent teeth is about 31% globally, according to the Global Burden of Disease Study. So that would be around 30%, which is option A. But wait, that's only for permanent teeth, and the question doesn't specify, so maybe the total is higher.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should go with the option that's closest to the 36.5% I calculated earlier, which would be 40% (option I). But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 60%, which is option D. No, that seems high. I think I've heard more around 35-40%.

Wait, looking back, the question is about untreated caries. So if 2.4 billion have untreated in permanent teeth and 486 million in primary, that's about 2.88 billion total. Let me compute that as a percentage.

7.9 billion is roughly 7,900 million. 2,880 million is about 2,880 / 7,900 â‰ˆ 0.365, so 36.5%. So the closest option is 40% (option I).

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using an older estimate, which might have been 30%. So I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, I think the correct answer is around 35%, which would round to 40% as the closest option. So I'm leaning towards option I: 40%.

But I'm not 100% certain. Another possibility is that the question refers to the prevalence in the permanent teeth only, which was about 31%, so 30% (option A). But the question doesn't specify, so it's probably including both.

In conclusion, I think the answer is I:40%. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's higher, but I think 40% makes sense based on the numbers I calculated.

The estimated global prevalence of untreated dental caries is a significant public health issue. Dental caries, or tooth decay, affects a large portion of the global population. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Global Burden of Disease Study, approximately 2.4 billion people have untreated caries in their permanent teeth, and an additional 486 million children have untreated caries in their primary teeth. This totals around 2.88 billion people globally. 

To calculate the prevalence, this number is divided by the global population of approximately 7.9 billion, resulting in a prevalence of roughly 36.5%. Among the provided options, the closest figure is 40% (option I). While there might be slight variations depending on the source or specific criteria, 40% aligns most closely with the estimated global prevalence of untreated dental caries.
