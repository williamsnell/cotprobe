Okay, so I have this bond question to solve. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it my best shot.

Alright, the problem says a state issues a 15-year $1000 bond that pays $25 every six months. The current market interest rate is 4%. I need to find the fair market value of the bond.

Hmm, I remember that bonds are priced based on the present value of their future cash flows. So I think I need to calculate the present value of all the interest payments and the return of the principal.

Wait, the bond pays $25 every six months. Since it's semiannual, that means there are two payments each year. The bond's face value is $1000, and the maturity is 15 years.

Wait, so the annual coupon payment would be $25 * 2 = $50 per year. But since the payments are semiannual, I should probably treat this as a series of semiannual periods. Oh right, because the market interest rate is given as 4%, which is an annual rate. But since the bond pays interest semiannually, I think I need to convert that 4% into a semiannual rate.

So the semiannual interest rate would be 4% divided by 2, which is 2% per period. Got that.

Now, the number of periods. The bond is 15 years, and each period is six months, so 15 * 2 = 30 periods.

The present value of the bond is the sum of the present value of all the coupon payments plus the present value of the face value at maturity.

Each coupon payment is $25. So I need to find the present value of an annuity of $25 for 30 periods at 2% per period.

The formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity is P = PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n)/r], where PMT is the payment, r is the rate per period, and n is the number of periods.

So plugging in the numbers, PMT is $25, r is 0.02, n is 30.

Calculating the numerator first: 1 - (1 + 0.02)^-30. Let me compute that.

(1.02)^30 is approximately... I remember that (1.02)^30 is about 1.806. So 1 divided by 1.806 is roughly 0.5537. So 1 - 0.5537 is 0.4463.

So the numerator is 0.4463. Then we divide that by 0.02, which gives us 22.315.

So 25 * 22.315 equals... 25 * 22 is 550, and 25 * 0.315 is about 7.875. So together, 557.875 approximately. So the present value of the coupons is about $557.88.

Next, the present value of the face value, which is $1000 received in 30 periods at 2% per period.

The formula is PV = FV / (1 + r)^n. So FV is 1000, r is 0.02, n is 30.

Again, (1.02)^30 is about 1.806, so 1000 / 1.806 is approximately 553.68.

So the present value of the face value is about $553.68.

Adding the two present values together: 557.88 (coupons) + 553.68 (face) = 1111.56.

Wait, but let me check my calculations more accurately. Maybe I approximated too much.

Wait, let's recalculate (1.02)^-30 more accurately. Alternatively, I can use the present value factor for an annuity.

Let me try to compute it more precisely.

The present value annuity factor (PVIFA) for r=0.02 and n=30. I can compute it as [1 - (1 + 0.02)^-30]/0.02.

Using a calculator, (1.02)^30 is approximately 1.805856. So 1/1.805856 ≈ 0.553681.

So 1 - 0.553681 = 0.446319. Divide by 0.02 gives 22.31595.

Multiply by 25: 25 * 22.31595 = 558.79875, which is about $558.80.

Then the present value of the face value: 1000 / (1.02)^30.

We've already determined that denominator is 1.805856, so 1000 / 1.805856 = approximately 553.681.

So total present value: 558.80 + 553.68 = 1,112.48.

Looking at the options, I see option G is 1111.97 and option E is 1085.65. Hmm, my calculation is around 1,112.48, which is close to 1,111.97.

Wait, perhaps I made a slight error in the exponents. Let me try to compute (1.02)^30 more accurately. Alternatively, maybe I should use the exact formula without approximating.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the present value using the exact formula.

Wait, another approach: the bond is priced at the present value of all cash flows. So each coupon is $25, every six months, for 30 periods. The face value is $1000 at period 30.

So the present value (PV) is 25/(1.02)^1 + 25/(1.02)^2 + ... +25/(1.02)^30 + 1000/(1.02)^30.

Alternatively, the formula for the PV of the coupon payments is 25 * [1 - (1.02)^-30 ] / 0.02.

Which is 25 * (1 - 1/(1.02)^30 ) / 0.02.

I can compute 1/(1.02)^30 accurately. Let me use a calculator for this.

1.02^30: Let's compute it step by step.

1.02^10: 1.2190.

1.02^20: (1.2190)^2 ≈ 1.48896.

1.02^30: 1.48896 * 1.2190 ≈ 1.8167.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 1.805856, perhaps more accurately. Let me compute it more accurately.

Using a calculator, 1.02^30 is approximately 1.80289, so 1/(1.02^30) is approximately 0.55347.

So 1 - 0.55347 = 0.44653. Divide by 0.02: 0.44653 / 0.02 = 22.3265.

Multiply by 25: 25 * 22.3265 = 558.1625.

Then the present value of the face value: 1000 / (1.02)^30 = 1000 * 0.55347 = 553.47.

Adding together: 558.1625 + 553.47 = 1,111.6325.

So approximately $1,111.63.

Looking at the options, option G is 1111.97, which is very close. So I think the correct answer is G.

But wait, perhaps in the options, the numbers are precise. Let me check if I missed any steps.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the present value of the bond, which is:

PV = (C / 2) / (r/2) * [1 - (1 + r/2)^-2n ] + F / (1 + r/2)^(2n)

Wait, no, that's perhaps more complicated. Alternatively, since it's semiannual, the formula can be written as:

PV = (C / (2)) * [ (1 - (1 + r/2)^-n ) / (r/2) ) ] + (F) / (1 + r/2)^n

Wait, where n is the number of years multiplied by 2 for semiannual payments. Actually, n is the number of periods. Wait, perhaps I should express it as:

PV = (C / 2) * [1 - (1 + r/2)^-n ] / (r/2) + F / (1 + r/2)^n

Where C is the annual coupon, which is $50, so C/2 is 25. n is 30 periods.

So plugging in:

(25) * [1 - (1 + 0.02)^-30 ] / 0.02 + 1000 / (1.02)^30.

Which is the same as I did earlier. So same result.

So the value comes to approximately $1,111.63, which is closest to option G: 1111.97.

Wait, but why is there a slight discrepancy? Perhaps because of rounding in intermediate steps. Let me compute it more accurately.

Calculating 1.02^30 precisely:

Using a calculator, 1.02^30 is approximately 1.8028563.

So 1/(1.02^30) = 0.553469.

So the present value of the face value: 1000 * 0.553469 ≈ 553.469.

Now, the present value of the coupons:

PMT = 25.

PVIFA = [1 - (1/(1.02^30))]/0.02 = [1 - 0.553469]/0.02 = 0.446531 / 0.02 = 22.26555.

So 25 * 22.26555 = 558.13875.

Adding to the face value PV: 558.13875 + 553.469 ≈ 1,111.60775.

So approximately $1,111.61. The closest option is G: 1,111.97. Hmm, but why is there a difference of about 0.39? Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate each part more accurately.

Wait, let me compute 25 * [ (1 - v^30) / 0.02 ] + 1000 * v^30, where v = 1/(1.02).

v^30 = 1/(1.02)^30 ≈ 0.553469.

So 1 - v^30 = 0.446531.

Divide by 0.02: 0.446531 / 0.02 = 22.26555.

Multiply by 25: 25 * 22.26555 = 558.13875.

Add 1000 * v^30: 1000 * 0.553469 = 553.469.

Total: 558.13875 + 553.469 = 1,111.60775.

So approximately $1,111.61. The option closest to this is G: 1,111.97. But wait, that's not exact. Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the number of periods or the rate.

Wait, the bond is 15 years, so 30 periods. The coupon is $25 each period, which is correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the market interest rate is 4% annually, but the bond pays semiannually. So perhaps I should use the effective annual rate approach.

Wait, the effective annual rate (EAR) for 4% semiannual compounding is (1 + 0.04/2)^2 - 1 = (1.02)^2 -1 = 1.0404, or 4.04%.

But no, wait, in bond valuation, the market interest rate is given as a nominal annual rate, and when the bond pays coupons semiannually, the discounting is done at the nominal rate divided by 2 each period. So I think the approach I took earlier is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the price of a bond:

Price = (C × (1 - (1 + r)^-n)) / r + F / (1 + r)^n

But wait, that's for annual payments. Since this bond has semiannual payments, I should adjust the formula.

Let me think. The formula for semiannual payments would be:

Price = (C/2) × [ (1 - (1 + r/2)^-n ) / (r/2) ) ] + F × (1 + r/2)^-n

Where n is the number of periods (30), and r is the annual market rate (4%).

So plugging in, C is $1000, but wait no, C is the annual coupon. The annual coupon is $50, as it's $25 every six months.

So C = $50, so C/2 = $25.

r = 4% = 0.04, so r/2 = 0.02.

n = 15 years * 2 = 30 periods.

So Price = 25 * [ (1 - (1.02)^-30 ) / 0.02 ] + 1000 * (1.02)^-30

Which is exactly the same as before.

So the calculation remains the same, leading to approximately $1,111.61.

Looking back at the options, option G is 1111.97. Hmm, that's very close. Maybe the difference is due to more precise calculation of (1.02)^30.

Wait, perhaps I can compute (1.02)^30 more accurately. Let me calculate it step by step.

Compute 1.02^1 = 1.02

^2 = 1.0404

^3 = 1.061208

^4 ≈ 1.082432

^5 ≈ 1.10408

^6 ≈ 1.12616

^7 ≈ 1.14869

^8 ≈ 1.17166

^9 ≈ 1.19509

^10 ≈ 1.21902

^11 ≈ 1.24363

^12 ≈ 1.26876

^13 ≈ 1.29456

^14 ≈ 1.32092

^15 ≈ 1.34785

^16 ≈ 1.37548

^17 ≈ 1.40363

^18 ≈ 1.43253

^19 ≈ 1.46235

^20 ≈ 1.49282

^21 ≈ 1.52414

^22 ≈ 1.55630

^23 ≈ 1.58976

^24 ≈ 1.62420

^25 ≈ 1.65970

^26 ≈ 1.69609

^27 ≈ 1.73363

^28 ≈ 1.77211

^29 ≈ 1.81168

^30 ≈ 1.85176? Wait, I thought earlier it was around 1.8028, but this step-by-step seems to get higher. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in manual calculation. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use a calculator for (1.02)^30.

Alternatively, perhaps I should trust the earlier calculation where (1.02)^30 is approximately 1.802856.

Wait, perhaps I confused the exponent. Let me check with a calculator function.

Using a calculator: 1.02 raised to 30 equals approximately 1.802856.

So 1/(1.02)^30 = 0.553469.

Thus, the present value calculations as before give us approximately $1,111.61.

But the option G is 1111.97, which is very close. Perhaps due to rounding during the calculation steps, the precise answer is 1111.97.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the number of periods. Let me double-check: 15 years, semiannual payments. So 15 * 2 = 30 periods. Correct.

Another thought: perhaps the question is using the simple present value formula without considering semiannual compounding correctly. But that's unlikely, because the coupon is paid semiannually.

Wait a moment, perhaps I should compute the present value using the formula for each cash flow.

But that would be tedious, but perhaps more precise.

Each coupon payment is $25 at periods 1 through 30, and $1000 at period 30.

So the present value is sum from t=1 to 30 of 25/(1.02)^t + 1000/(1.02)^30.

But the sum of the coupons is an annuity, which we've already calculated.

So the calculation remains the same.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the price using the formula for each period.

Wait, but that's what I did earlier.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused why the exact calculation gives me approximately 1,111.61, but the option is 1,111.97. Perhaps the answer is G, and the slight difference is due to rounding in intermediate steps.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the present value of the annuity. Let me recheck that.

PVIFA = [1 - (1.02)^-30]/0.02.

We have (1.02)^-30 = 1 / 1.802856 ≈ 0.553469.

So 1 - 0.553469 = 0.446531.

Divided by 0.02 gives 22.26555.

Multiply by 25: 25 * 22.26555 = 558.13875.

Plus the present value of face value: 553.469.

Total: 558.13875 + 553.469 = 1,111.60775.

So approximately $1,111.61.

Looking at the options, the closest is G: 1,111.97.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation gives 1,111.97.

Wait, maybe I should use more precise factors.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the present value using the formula for each cash flow.

Wait, but that's time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can accept that the closest option is G.
</think>

To determine the fair market value of the bond, we calculate the present value of all future cash flows, including the semiannual coupon payments and the return of the principal at maturity. The bond has a face value of $1,000, a 15-year maturity, and pays $25 every six months. The current market interest rate is 4%, which is semiannual, so the periodic interest rate is 2% (4% divided by 2).

### Key Calculations:
1. **Number of Periods**:  
   Since the bond pays interest semiannually, the total number of periods is:  
   \[
   n = 15 \times 2 = 30
   \]

2. **Present Value of Coupon Payments**:  
   The bond pays $25 every six months, which is an ordinary annuity. The present value of the coupon payments is calculated using the formula for the present value of an annuity:  
   \[
   PV_{\text{coupons}} = PMT \times \left[\frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r}\right]
