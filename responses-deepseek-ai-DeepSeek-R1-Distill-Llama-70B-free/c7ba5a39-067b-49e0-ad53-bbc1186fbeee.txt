Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the question is about allele frequencies in a population and how they change when immigrants are introduced. Hmm, I remember that allele frequencies can change due to several factors like selection, mutation, genetic drift, and gene flow. Oh right, gene flow is the movement of individuals with different genes into a population, which can definitely change allele frequencies.

The problem gives me some numbers. So the isolated population has 100 individuals, and the frequency of allele S is 0.65. Then, immigrants are introduced at a rate of one new immigrant per population per generation. These immigrants have a frequency of S at 0.85. I need to find the frequency of S after one generation.

Wait, let me clarify. The original population is 100, and each generation, one new immigrant is added. So after one generation, the population size changes? Or is the immigrant replacing someone? No, I think it's adding to the population. So the initial population is 100, and then one immigrant joins, making it 101? Or is the population size kept constant?

Wait, the problem says "one new immigrant per population per generation." So perhaps each existing population (maybe the initial 100) is getting one immigrant. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently.

Wait, maybe it's about the calculation of allele frequency after migration. I think the formula for gene flow is something like:

p' = (p * (N) + (m * p_m)) / (N + m)

Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again. Oh wait, no, the formula for the new allele frequency when migrants are added would be the weighted average of the original population and the migrants.

So, the original population has N individuals, each contributing their alleles, and the immigrants contribute their alleles based on their own frequency.

Wait, but if it's one immigrant, then perhaps the calculation is:

New frequency = (original population's S count + immigrant's S count) / (original population size + number of immigrants).

But wait, each individual has two alleles, right? So for diploid organisms, each individual contributes two copies of the gene. So the total allele count is 2N.

Wait, but the question says the population is 100, so perhaps N is 100. But each has two alleles, so the total alleles for S in the original population are 100 * 2 * 0.65.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The frequency of allele S is 0.65 in the population. So the total number of S alleles is 0.65 * 2N, where N is the number of individuals. But wait, the population size is 100, so N=100.

Wait, but if one immigrant comes in, the new population size is 101. So the new S frequency would be:

[ (Original S count) + (Immigrant's S count) ] / [Total alleles in new population]

Original S count: 100 individuals, each has 2 alleles, so 200 total alleles. 65% are S, so 0.65 * 200 = 130 S alleles.

The immigrant has two alleles as well, and since the immigrant's S frequency is 0.85, that's 2 * 0.85 = 1.7 S alleles. Wait, but you can't have a fraction of an allele. Oh, but in the context of population genetics, we're dealing with frequencies, so fractional values are okay.

So the total S alleles after immigration would be 130 (original) + 1.7 (immigrant) = 131.7.

The total alleles in the population now are 200 (original) + 2 (immigrant) = 202.

So the new frequency p' is 131.7 / 202.

Let me calculate that. 131.7 divided by 202. Hmm, 202 is about 200, and 131.7 is about 130. So 130/200 is 0.65. But precise calculation:

131.7 / 202. Let me do it step by step.

202 * 0.65 = 131.3. So 202 * 0.652 = let's see, 0.652 * 202.

Wait, 202 * 0.6 is 121.2; 202 * 0.05 is 10.1; 202 * 0.002 is 0.404. So 121.2 +10.1=131.3 + 0.404=131.704. So 0.652 *202=131.704. But our numerator is 131.7, which is a bit less than 131.704. So 131.7/202 is approximately 0.6517, which is about 0.652.

Wait, but the options are given as C: 0.652, E: 0.66, etc.

Wait, let me check my approach again. Another way to approach it is using the formula for gene flow, which is:

p' = p + m(p_m - p)

Where m is the proportion of immigrants in the population.

Wait, but in this case, the population increases. So the initial population is 100. After adding one immigrant, it's 101. So the proportion of immigrants is 1/101.

So p' = p*(1 - m) + m*p_m.

Hmm, let's plug in the numbers.

p is 0.65, p_m is 0.85, m is 1/101.

So p' = 0.65*(100/101) + (1/101)*0.85.

Calculate each term:

100/101 is approximately 0.990099.

So 0.65 * 0.990099 ≈ 0.643564.

And 1/101 is approx 0.00990099.

0.85 * 0.00990099 ≈ 0.00841508.

Adding them together: 0.643564 + 0.00841508 ≈ 0.651979, which is approximately 0.652, so option C.

Alternatively, using the count method:

Original alleles: 100 diploid → 200 alleles. 65% S → 130 S.

After adding 1 immigrant: 101 diploid →202 alleles.

Immigrant's S count: 2 alleles, 85% S → 1.7 S.

Total S: 130 +1.7=131.7.

131.7 / 202 = 0.65198… ≈0.652, so option C.

But wait, the initial population is 100, and one immigrant. So N was 100, now it's 101. So in the count method, the total alleles are 202.

Wait, but the other way, if I think about the gene flow formula, perhaps the population size remains 100, but one individual is replaced by an immigrant. Wait, the problem says "one new immigrant per population per generation." So perhaps each generation, one immigrant is added, so population size increases by one each time.

So for one generation, the population goes from 100 to 101. So yes, my initial approach is correct.

So the new frequency is approximately 0.652, which is option C.

Looking at the options:

A: 0.95 → too high.

B: 1.00 → way too high.

C:0.652 → matches.

D:0.70 → higher than 0.65, but our result is just a slight increase.

E:0.66 → 0.66 is higher than 0.652, but close. Let me check the exact calculation.

Wait, 131.7 / 202.

Let me compute this precisely.

Calculate 131.7 ÷ 202.

Let me do long division.

202 goes into 1317 how many times?

202 *6=1212 → 202 *6=1212. Subtract from 1317: 1317-1212=105.

Bring down a zero: 1050.

202 *5=1010. So 5 times. Subtract: 1050-1010=40.

Bring down zero: 400.

202*1=202. Subtract: 400-202=198.

Bring down zero: 1980.

202*9=1818 → 1980-1818=162.

Bring down zero: 1620.

202*8=1616 → 1620-1616=4.

So up to this point, the division is 6.518... So 0.6518 approximately.

So 0.6518 is approximately 0.652, which is option C.

Another approach: the change due to immigration is small. Since only one individual is added, the change in allele frequency shouldn't be too big.

The initial frequency is 0.65. With one immigrant, the new S is 0.65*(200/202) + 0.85*(2/202).

Calculate each term:

200/202 ≈0.990099, so 0.65 * 0.990099 ≈0.64356.

2/202 ≈0.00990099, so 0.85 *0.00990099≈0.008415.

Adding them: 0.64356 + 0.008415≈0.651975, which is 0.652, so option C.

So the correct answer should be C:0.652.

To calculate the frequency of allele S after one generation of immigrants, we use the concept of gene flow. The original population has 100 individuals, and the frequency of allele S is 0.65. Each individual is diploid, so there are 200 alleles in total. The number of S alleles in the original population is:

\[
\text{Original S count} = 0.65 \times 200 = 130.
\]

One immigrant is added, and the immigrant's frequency of S is 0.85. Since the immigrant is also diploid, the number of S alleles contributed by the immigrant is:

\[
\text{Immigrant S count} = 0.85 \times 2 = 1.7.
\]

The total number of S alleles after immigration is:

\[
\text{Total S count} = 130 + 1.7 = 131.7.
\]

The total number of alleles in the new population is:

\[
\text{Total alleles} = 200 + 2 = 202.
\]

The new frequency of allele S is:

\[
p' = \frac{\text{Total S count}}{\text{Total alleles}} = \frac{131.7}{202}.
\]

Performing the division:

\[
p' \approx 0.652.
\]

Thus, the frequency of allele S after one generation is approximately 0.652. Among the given options, the closest match is:

**C: 0.652.**
