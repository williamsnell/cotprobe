Okay, so I have this problem here where I'm supposed to find F(3.02) approximately, given that F(3) is 8 and F'(3) is -4. Hmm, I remember from calculus that when you have a function and its derivative at a point, you can use a linear approximation to estimate the function's value near that point. I think this is called the tangent line approximation or something like that.

Wait, right, the formula for linear approximation is F(x) ≈ F(a) + F’(a)(x - a), where a is the point we know, which in this case is 3. So here, a is 3, x is 3.02, F(a) is 8, and F’(a) is -4.

Let me plug those numbers in. So F(3.02) ≈ 8 + (-4)*(3.02 - 3). Let me calculate that. 3.02 minus 3 is 0.02. So the change in x is 0.02. Multiply that by the derivative, which is -4: -4 * 0.02 equals -0.08. Then add that to F(3), which is 8. So 8 + (-0.08) is 7.92.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. 3.02 is two hundredths above 3, so the delta x is 0.02. The derivative is the slope, so it's -4 per unit change in x. So over 0.02 change, it's -4 * 0.02 = -0.08. So subtracting that from 8 gives 7.92. 

Looking at the options, the options are A:7.92, B:8.00, etc. So the answer should be A, 7.92. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculation. Oh wait, 0.02 times -4 is indeed -0.08. So 8 minus 0.08 is 7.92. Okay, that makes sense.

Alternatively, I could think about units. The derivative is the rate of change, so for a small change in x, the function changes by F’(x) times delta x. So yes, that's the approach. So I think A is the correct answer.

To approximate \( F(3.02) \) given \( F(3) = 8 \) and \( F'(3) = -4 \), we use the linear approximation formula:

\[
F(x) \approx F(a) + F'(a)(x - a),
\]

where \( a = 3 \), \( x = 3.02 \), \( F(a) = 8 \), and \( F'(a) = -4 \). Substituting these values:

\[
F(3.02) \approx 8 + (-4)(3.02 - 3).
\]

The change in \( x \) is \( 3.02 - 3 = 0.02 \). Thus:

\[
F(3.02) \approx 8 + (-4)(0.02) = 8 - 0.08 = 7.92.
\]

From the given options, the closest value is:

**A: 7.92**
