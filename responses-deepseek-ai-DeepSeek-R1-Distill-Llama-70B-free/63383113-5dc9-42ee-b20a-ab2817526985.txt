Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a car starting from rest and accelerating uniformly. I need to find out how long it takes to cover 200 meters. Hmm, let's think about this step by step.

Alright, the car starts from rest, so its initial velocity is zero. It's accelerating at 5 m/s². I remember that when dealing with constant acceleration, there are some kinematic equations that can help. The basic ones are the equations of motion, like the one that relates distance, initial velocity, time, and acceleration.

Wait, the equation I think I need here is s = ut + (1/2) a t². Oh right, because s is the displacement, u is the initial velocity, a is acceleration, and t is time. Since the car starts from rest, u is zero, so that simplifies the equation. So the equation becomes s = (1/2) a t².

The problem gives s as 200 meters and a as 5 m/s². Plugging those in, I get 200 = (1/2) * 5 * t². Let me do the math here. Half of 5 is 2.5, so 200 equals 2.5 times t squared. To solve for t squared, I divide both sides by 2.5. So t² equals 200 divided by 2.5. Let me calculate that: 200 / 2.5 is... 80. So t squared is 80. Taking the square root of both sides, t equals the square root of 80. 

What's the square root of 80? Well, 8 times 10 is 80. So sqrt(80) is sqrt(16*5) which is 4 times sqrt(5). I know sqrt(5) is approximately 2.236. So 4 times 2.236 is about 8.944 seconds. Let me double-check that because sometimes I might mix up the calculations.

Wait, 8.944 squared is (approx) 80. Yep, because 8 squared is 64 and 0.944 squared is around 0.89, but when you cross multiply, it's roughly 80.

Looking at the options, I see option C is 9.0 s, which is the closest to my calculation. Then there's option D at 8.0 s, which is a bit lower, but my approximation was around 8.944, which is almost 9. So I think option C is the correct answer.

Alternatively, maybe I should check if I used the right equation. Another way to approach this is using v² = u² + 2as. Since u is 0, v² = 2as. Solving this for time would require finding v first, but then I'd need to find t using v = u + at. Let me try that method as a double-check.

So, using v² = 2as: v² = 2 *5 *200. That's 2000, so v is sqrt(2000). Which is sqrt(100*20) = 10*sqrt(20). Wait, sqrt(20) is approx 4.472, so 10 *4.472 is 44.72 m/s. 

Now, using v = u + at. u is 0, so v = a t. So t = v/a. 44.72 divided by 5 is approx 8.944 seconds. Same result as before. So this confirms it's about 8.944, so 9.0 seconds when rounded to one decimal place. So option C, 9.0 s.

I think that's solid. So the answer should be C.

To determine how long it takes for a car starting from rest and accelerating uniformly at 5 m/s² to cover a distance of 200 m, we use the kinematic equation:

\[
s = ut + \frac{1}{2} a t^2
\]

Since the car starts from rest (\(u = 0\)), the equation simplifies to:

\[
s = \frac{1}{2} a t^2
\]

Substituting the given values (\(s = 200 \, \text{m}\) and \(a = 5 \, \text{m/s}^2\)):

\[
200 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 5 \cdot t^2
\]

\[
200 = 2.5 \cdot t^2
\]

Solving for \(t^2\):

\[
t^2 = \frac{200}{2.5} = 80
\]

Taking the square root of both sides:

\[
t = \sqrt{80} \approx 8.944 \, \text{s}
\]

This value is approximately \(8.944 \, \text{s}\), which rounds to \(9.0 \, \text{s}\). Comparing this result to the provided options, the closest match is:

**C: 9.0 s**

Thus, the correct answer is:
