Question:

Five years after being shot in the right thigh, a 21-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of a buzzing sensation adjacent to the scar. At the time of the initial wound, he was discharged after 6 hours of observation with no fractures or soft-tissue swelling. A loud murmur is heard on auscultation; there is a thrill. He has dilated varicose veins with incompetent valves in the lower leg. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:

A: Occlusion of the superficial femoral artery
B: Venous ulcer
C: Superficial venous thrombosis
D: Arteriovenous fistula
E: Lymphedema
F: Chronic venous insufficiency
G: Arterial spasm
H: Pulmonary embolism
I: Deep venous thrombosis
J: Peripheral artery disease

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this medical question. Let me read it again carefully.

The patient is a 21-year-old man who was shot in the right thigh five years ago. After the injury, he was observed for six hours and discharged without any fractures or soft tissue swelling. Now, he comes to the ED with a buzzing sensation near the scar. On exam, there's a loud murmur and a thrill. He also has dilated varicose veins with incompetent valves in the lower leg.

Hmm. So, the key points here are the history of a gunshot wound, current symptoms of a buzzing sound (which might indicate some abnormal blood flow), and the physical findings of murmur and thrill. Also, the varicose veins with incompetent valves suggest some venous issue.

I remember that a thrill is a vibration felt on the skin overlying a vascular structure, often indicating turbulent blood flow, like in a stenotic area or maybe an arteriovenous fistula. The murmur would likely be a bruit, which is a sound heard over an artery indicating turbulent flow.

Arteriovenous fistula (AV fistula) comes to mind. An AV fistula is an abnormal connection between an artery and a vein. Since he was shot, it's possible that the injury caused such a fistula. The symptoms of an AV fistula include a bruit or murmur heard over the area, a thrill, and signs of increased venous pressure downstream. That would explain the varicose veins because the high-pressure arterial blood flows directly into the veins, leading to their dilation and incompetence over time.

Looking at the options:

A: Occlusion of the superficial femoral artery. That would cause ischemic symptoms, maybe claudication, but probably not a murmur or thrill. Plus, it's more about arterial blockage, not venous issues.

B: Venous ulcer. That's a possible complication of chronic venous insufficiency, but it doesn't explain the murmur and thrill.

C: Superficial venous thrombosis. Thrombosis would cause pain and swelling, maybe warmth, but not a bruit or thrill.

D: Arteriovenous fistula. This fits because a fistula can cause a bruit, thrill, and the venous changes like varicosities.

E: Lymphedema. That's swelling from lymphatic issues, but it doesn't explain the vascular sounds.

F: Chronic venous insufficiency. This leads to varicose veins and possibly ulcers, but again, no murmur or thrill.

G: Arterial spasm. That would cause pain and maybe decreased pulses, but no bruit.

H: Pulmonary embolism. That's a blockage in the lungs, presenting with sudden shortness of breath, not related to these symptoms.

I: Deep venous thrombosis. Similar to option C, DVT would cause swelling and pain, but not bruit or thrill.

J: Peripheral artery disease. That's more about atherosclerosis and decreased blood flow, leading to claudication, not the findings here.

So the most likely diagnosis is D: Arteriovenous fistula. The gunshot caused an abnormal connection between an artery and vein, leading to the murmur, thrill, and venous dilation.

The patient is a 21-year-old man with a history of a gunshot wound to the right thigh five years prior. He now presents with a buzzing sensation near the scar, a loud murmur, a thrill, and dilated varicose veins with incompetent valves in the lower leg. These findings suggest turbulent blood flow and venous hypertension, which are characteristic of an arteriovenous fistula (AV fistula). An AV fistula is an abnormal connection between an artery and a vein, which can result from penetrating trauma like a gunshot wound. The murmur (bruit) and thrill are due to turbulent arterial blood flowing directly into the venous system, bypassing the capillary network. This high-pressure flow leads to venous dilation and incompetence, causing varicose veins.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Occlusion of the superficial femoral artery** would cause ischemic symptoms, not a murmur or thrill.
- **B: Venous ulcer** is a complication of chronic venous insufficiency but does not explain the bruit or thrill.
- **C: Superficial venous thrombosis** would cause pain and swelling, not turbulent flow sounds.
- **D: Arteriovenous fistula** fits the clinical findings, including the bruit, thrill, and venous changes.
- **E: Lymphedema** involves lymphatic swelling, unrelated to the vascular findings here.
- **F: Chronic venous insufficiency** leads to varicose veins but does not cause a murmur or thrill.
- **G: Arterial spasm** would cause pain and decreased pulses, not turbulent flow sounds.
- **H: Pulmonary embolism** presents with respiratory symptoms, not relevant here.
- **I: Deep venous thrombosis** causes swelling and pain, not bruit or thrill.
- **J: Peripheral artery disease** involves atherosclerosis and ischemia, not the findings described.

The most likely diagnosis is **D: Arteriovenous fistula**, as it explains the murmur, thrill, and venous changes due to the abnormal arterial-venous connection caused by the gunshot wound.
