Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about psychology methods, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question asks to list and describe the important methods of investigation in psychology. The options are from A to J, each giving different methods.

I remember that psychology uses various research methods to study behavior and mental processes. The main methods I can think of include experiments, case studies, surveys, and observations. Oh wait, there's also longitudinal studies and maybe some others.

Looking at the options:

Option A mentions placebo-controlled studies, double-blind experiments, and longitudinal research. Those sound familiar, especially in fields like medicine and psychology. Placebo-controlled and double-blind are common in experiments to reduce bias.

Option B lists introspection, dream analysis, and free association. Introspection is an older method where participants report their thoughts. Dream analysis and free association are more related to Freudian psychoanalysis, so maybe more specific to that approach rather than general psychology methods.

Option C has telepathy, astrology, phrenology. Wait, those don't sound like psychology methods. Telepathy is about reading minds, astrology is about zodiac signs, and phrenology is the discredited study of skull shapes. So C is probably wrong.

Option D says the major methods are case study, naturalistic observation, tests, interviews, surveys, experimentation. That sounds comprehensive. Case studies look at individuals, naturalistic observation is observing in natural settings, tests and interviews/surveys are data collection methods, and experimentation is a big one.

Option E includes case law review, cross-examination, and witness testimony. Those are legal terms, not psychology research methods. So E is out.

Option F: evaluation, observation, statistical analysis. Observation is a method, but evaluation and statistical analysis are more data analysis techniques rather than investigation methods themselves.

Option G: deduction, induction, analogy. These are reasoning methods, not specific research methods in psychology.

Option H: brain scanning, genetic mapping, evolutionary tracking. Brain scanning like fMRI is used, but genetic mapping and evolutionary tracking might be more biology or genetics methods, not primary in psychology research.

Option I: psychoanalysis, behaviorism, humanistic approaches. These are theoretical perspectives or schools of thought in psychology, not specific research methods.

Option J: hypothesis testing, qualitative analysis, correlation studies. Hypothesis testing is part of experimentation, qualitative analysis is a data method, and correlation studies are a type of research design. But they might not cover all the main methods.

So, going back, the question asks for the important methods. Option D lists several key ones: case studies, naturalistic observation, tests, interviews, surveys, experimentation. That seems to cover a broad range of methods used in psychology. For example, experiments are a cornerstone, case studies for in-depth analysis, naturalistic observation for natural behavior, and surveys/interviews for self-reported data.

Option A also mentions some experimental methods but misses others like case studies or observations. Option D seems more inclusive of different approaches.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is D.

The correct answer is D.

D: The major methods of psychology are: the individual case study, naturalistic observation, tests, interviews and surveys, and experimentation.

Answer: D
