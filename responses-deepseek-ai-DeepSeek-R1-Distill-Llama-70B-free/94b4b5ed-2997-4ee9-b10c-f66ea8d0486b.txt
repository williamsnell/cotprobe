Question:

A city has adopted the following ordinance which provides:"Section 1: It shall be unlawful for any person, group, or organization to hold a meeting of 50 persons or more in any city park without first securing a city permit;Section 2: The application shall specify the day and hours for which the permit is sought. The fee shall be $10 per hour, with a maximum fee of $50;Section 3: Permits shall be issued on a first come basis; provided that the chief of police shall deny any application if, after hearing the applicant, it is his considered judgment that (a) the meeting would create serious traffic congestion, or (b) interfere with public enjoyment of the park, or (c) speakers at the meeting would advocate the commission of crime. "A religious fundamentalist who believes that other religions should be violently resisted, planned to hold a protest demonstration against other religions at a city park on July 25. Although his previous anti-religion protest rallies attracted fewer than 25 demonstrators, he decided to apply for a permit pursuant to the city's ordinance. After meeting with the fundamentalist, the chief of police denied his permit application because he believed that the demonstration would incite the protestors and threaten imminent violence or serious disorder. On July 25, the fundamentalist and his fellow demonstrators staged their protest at a city park. The rally attracted only about 20 protestors and was conducted peacefully. As he was making his final remarks to the gathering, the city police arrived at the park and arrested him and his fellow demonstrators charging them with violating the city ordinance. If the fundamentalist now brings suit to challenge the constitutionality of Section 3 of the city ordinance, his best argument would be that

Options:

A: the section does not fall within the area of compelling state interest.
B: the section is content based.
C: the section permits the police chief to exercise unbridled discretion in approving or disapproving permits.
D: the section imposes undue financial burden on applicants.
E: the section does not specify a clear process for appeal against permit denial.
F: the section discriminates against certain religious beliefs.
G: the section violates the right to peaceful assembly.
H: the section does not provide specific criteria for denial of permits.

Okay, I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about constitutional law, specifically dealing with freedom of speech and assembly. Let me break it down step by step.

So, the question revolves around a city ordinance that regulates meetings in city parks. The ordinance has three sections. The fundamentalist applied for a permit but was denied by the police chief, who thought the demonstration would incite violence or disorder. Despite the denial, they held a peaceful rally with 20 people and got arrested for violating the ordinance. Now, the fundamentalist is challenging the constitutionality of Section 3.

The question is asking what his best argument would be. The options are A through H, each pointing out a different constitutional issue.

First, I need to understand the key points of the ordinance and the situation. Section 3 allows the police chief to deny a permit if he believes the meeting would cause traffic congestion, interfere with public enjoyment, or if speakers would advocate crime. The fundamentalist was denied because the chief thought it would incite violence, but the actual event was peaceful.

So, looking at the options, the main issue here is probably about the constitutionality of the permit denial criteria. The ordinance is a type of prior restraint, which requires careful scrutiny under the First Amendment.

I remember that content-neutral regulations are usually subject to intermediate scrutiny, while content-based ones are subject to strict scrutiny. Also, if the regulation gives too much discretion to the authorities without clear guidelines, it might be considered unconstitutional because it could lead to arbitrary censorship.

Looking at Section 3, the denial is based on the content of the speech. The police chief is making a judgment about what the speakers will say and whether it might lead to violence. That sounds like it's based on the content of the message, which could make it a content-based regulation.

Option B says the section is content-based. That could be a problem because content-based restrictions are subject to strict scrutiny, and the government must show a compelling interest and that the law is narrowly tailored.

Another option is C, which argues that the police chief has too much discretion. This relates to the concept of "unbridled discretion," which the Supreme Court has warned against because it can lead to arbitrary suppression of speech. For example, in cases like Hague v. CIO, the Court struck down ordinances that gave too much power to officials without clear standards.

Option H suggests the section doesn't provide specific criteria for denial. This ties into the same idea as option C. If the criteria are too vague, the official's discretion isn't properly limited, leading to potential First Amendment violations.

So, the fundamentalist's best argument would likely focus on the fact that Section 3 is content-based or that it allows too much discretion without clear guidelines.

I think content-based is a stronger argument here because the denial is specifically based on the anticipated speech content (advocating crime or causing violence). This could be seen as the government suppressing speech it deems dangerous, which is a classic First Amendment issue.

Wait, but in the case of Brandenburg v. Ohio, the Supreme Court held that speech can be restricted if it incites imminent lawless action. However, the ordinance here might be broader than that standard, potentially violating the First Amendment by allowing prior restraint based on content.

Alternatively, the issue could be that the ordinance doesn't have narrow enough criteria, allowing the chief too much leeway to deny permits based on subjective judgments about the content of the speech.

So, options B, C, and H are all possible. But which is the best argument?

Option B is about content-based regulation. If the section is content-based, it's subject to strict scrutiny, which is harder to meet. The city would need a compelling interest and the law must be narrowly tailored. Here, the denial was based on the content (potential to incite violence), so it's content-based.

Option C argues that the police chief has unbridled discretion. This is also a concern because without clear standards, the official might discriminate against certain viewpoints. But in the ordinance, there are specific criteria: traffic congestion, public enjoyment, and advocating crime. So maybe the discretion isn't completely unbridled, but it's still based on content.

Option H says the section doesn't provide specific criteria. But Section 3 does list specific reasons, like traffic, public enjoyment, and crime advocacy. So perhaps H isn't the best, because the criteria are there.

Therefore, the best argument might be that it's content-based (Option B) or that it allows too much discretion (Option C). But since the denial was based on the content of the speech (inciting violence), the content-based argument seems stronger. 

Wait, another thought: the Supreme Court has held that when the government's licensing scheme is content-neutral and leaves ample alternative channels of communication, it's more likely to be upheld. But if it's content-based, it's more problematic.

In this case, the denial was based on the content (speech that may incite violence), so it's content-based. Therefore, the ordinance is a content-based restriction, making Option B the best argument.

Alternatively, if the criteria are too vague, it could be that the ordinance is unconstitutional as applied, but the better argument is that it's content-based.

So, I think the answer is B: the section is content-based.

The question revolves around a city ordinance regulating meetings in city parks, specifically Section 3, which allows the police chief to deny permits based on certain criteria, including whether the meeting would incite violence or disorder. The fundamentalist was denied a permit under this section, despite holding a peaceful rally, and is now challenging its constitutionality.

The key issue is whether Section 3 violates the First Amendment, particularly regarding freedom of speech and assembly. The denial of the permit was based on the content of the speech, as the police chief judged that the fundamentalist's message might incite violence. This makes the regulation content-based, which is subject to strict scrutiny under the First Amendment. Content-based restrictions must meet a compelling government interest and be narrowly tailored, which Section 3 likely fails to do.

While other options, such as the police chief having too much discretion (Option C) or the lack of specific criteria (Option H), are relevant, the strongest argument is that Section 3 is content-based. This is because the denial was directly tied to the anticipated speech content, raising concerns about government suppression of speech based on its message.
