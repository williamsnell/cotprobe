Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about international law, specifically about the formal sources and their relationships. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking about the relationship between the formal sources of international law. The options are from A to J. I remember that the sources of international law are outlined in the Statute of the International Court of Justice, Article 38. Let me recall what that says.

Article 38 lists the sources as:
1. Treaties (or international conventions) as the primary source.
2. International custom, which is the general practice accepted as law.
3. The general principles of law recognized by civilized nations.
4. Judicial decisions and the teachings of qualified publicists as subsidiary means.

Wait, but the question is about the hierarchy among these sources. So do they have a specific order of importance, or is it more nuanced?

I think the traditional view is that treaties are considered the most important. Treaties are like contracts between states, so they're binding on the parties. Then comes custom, because it's based on long-standing practice and opinio juris. The general principles of law are more abstract and might fill in gaps, but they're probably lower in the hierarchy. Judicial decisions and teachings are subsidiary, so they help in applying the law but aren't primary sources themselves.

But wait, some argue that there isn't a strict hierarchy among treaties, custom, and general principles. It might depend on the context of each case. For example, a treaty might take precedence over custom if it's more specific, but custom can also be a basis for certain norms.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Treaties supersede custom. That seems too absolute. Because sometimes custom can be superior, like in cases of peremptory norms (jus cogens), which can't be derogated by treaties.

Option B: Treaties and General Principles are equal and supersede custom. Not sure about that. Treaties and custom are both primary, but I don't think general principles are higher than custom.

Option C: General Principles supersede both. That doesn't sound right. I think treaties and custom are more primary.

Option D: Judicial decisions and teachings are the only sources. No, that's wrong because the question is about formal sources, and judicial decisions are subsidiary.

Option E: Judicial decisions and teachings supersede others. Definitely not, same as D.

Option F: Custom and General Principles are equal and above treaties. That doesn't align with my understanding; treaties are usually primary.

Option G: Hierarchy varies by case. Hmm, that makes sense because the application can depend on the situation. But I'm not entirely certain if that's the accepted view.

Option H: Custom supersedes treaties. I think it's the opposite in most cases, but not always.

Option I: Treaties and custom are equal, but General Principles are higher. No, I don't think so.

Option J: No hierarchy between formal sources. That might be the case, but I thought treaties were primary.

Wait, according to Article 38, the order is treaties first, then custom, then general principles, and then judicial decisions. But in practice, the hierarchy isn't always clear-cut. It might depend on the specific circumstances. So for example, a rule of jus cogens (which is a type of custom) can't be changed by a treaty. So in that case, custom would override a treaty.

So perhaps the hierarchy isn't fixed but depends on the situation. So the answer would be G, that the hierarchy varies from case to case.

Alternatively, I've heard that there's no strict hierarchy, and sources can interact in a complementary way. So maybe J is the correct answer, that there's no hierarchy.

Wait, but I thought the ICJ statute lists them in order of priority, implying a hierarchy. But in reality, does that hold?

I think the better understanding is that while Article 38 lists them in order, it's not a strict hierarchy. Courts may prioritize different sources based on the context. So the correct answer would be either G or J.

Looking back at the options:

Option G says "there is a hierarchy, but it varies from case to case."

Option J says "there is no hierarchy between the formal sources."

I'm a bit confused. I remember reading that there's no clear hierarchy, and the sources are considered in conjunction. So perhaps J is correct.

Wait, but another thought: Treaties are considered primary because they are specific agreements between states. Custom is more general. So when a treaty and custom conflict, which one prevails? It might depend on which one is more specific or later in time, but there's no hard rule. So maybe that's why the hierarchy isn't fixed, making G correct.

Alternatively, if the question is about the formal sources as per Article 38, perhaps the answer is that there's no hierarchy, as the ICJ can apply them as needed. But I'm not entirely certain.

I think the correct answer is that there's no hierarchy; the sources are considered together. So J would be correct.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Another angle: in practice, if a treaty and custom conflict, which takes precedence? There's no clear rule, so it varies by case, which points to G.

Hmm. I'm torn between G and J. But the question is about the relationship between the formal sources. Some sources say that treaties are the primary source, but others, like custom, can be equally authoritative. So perhaps there is no strict hierarchy, making J the answer.

Wait, I think the correct answer is J: There is no hierarchy between the formal sources of international law.

Wait, but I've also heard that treaties are considered the primary source. So maybe that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that there is no hierarchy, so J.

Wait, let me think again. The formal sources are treaties, custom, and general principles. The ICJ may apply them as needed, and there isn't a strict hierarchy. So the answer is J.

The question concerns the relationship between the formal sources of international law, as outlined in Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice. These sources include treaties, international custom, general principles of law, and judicial decisions and teachings of qualified publicists (the latter being subsidiary means). The key issue is whether there is a strict hierarchy among these sources or if their priority depends on the context.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Treaties supersede custom. This is too absolute, as custom, particularly peremptory norms (jus cogens), can take precedence over treaties in certain cases.
- **Option B**: Treaties and General Principles of Law are of equal importance, but both supersede custom. This is incorrect because treaties and custom are generally considered primary sources, while general principles are more abstract and secondary.
- **Option C**: General Principles of Law supersede both custom and treaties. This is incorrect, as treaties and custom are primary sources, while general principles are subsidiary.
- **Option D**: Judicial decisions and teachings of the most highly qualified publicists are the only sources of international law. This is incorrect, as these are subsidiary means, not primary sources.
- **Option E**: Judicial decisions and teachings of the most highly qualified publicists supersede both custom and treaties. This is also incorrect for the same reason as D.
- **Option F**: Custom and General Principles of Law are of equal importance, but both supersede treaties. This is incorrect, as treaties are generally considered the primary source.
- **Option G**: There is a hierarchy, but it varies from case to case. This is plausible because the application of sources can depend on the specific context, such as the specificity of a treaty or the nature of a custom.
- **Option H**: Custom supersedes treaties. This is not universally true, as treaties are often primary, though custom can prevail in certain cases (e.g., jus cogens).
- **Option I**: Treaties and custom are of equal importance, but General Principles of Law supersede both. This is incorrect, as general principles are not superior to treaties or custom.
- **Option J**: There is no hierarchy between the formal sources of international law. This is a strong contender, as the ICJ often applies sources in a complementary manner without a strict hierarchy.

While Article 38 lists the sources in a specific order, suggesting a hierarchy, the reality is that the ICJ and international law often approach these sources flexibly, considering them together rather than adhering to a rigid hierarchy. Thus, the most accurate answer is that there is no strict hierarchy between the formal sources of international law.

Answer: J
