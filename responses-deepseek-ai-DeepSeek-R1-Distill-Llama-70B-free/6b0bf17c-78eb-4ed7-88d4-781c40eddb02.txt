Okay, so I've got this problem about heat loss through a plane wall of an oven. Hmm, I remember that this has to do with heat transfer, specifically conduction through walls. Let me think about what I learned in my classes.

The wall is made up of two layers: the first is refractory brick, 6 inches thick, with a thermal conductivity (k) of 0.08 Btu/hr-ft-°F. The second layer is common brick, 9 inches thick, with a k of 0.8 Btu/hr-ft-°F. The temperatures at the inner and outer surfaces are 1800°F and 200°F, respectively. I need to find the rate of heat loss per unit area through this wall.

Wait, so the formula for heat transfer through a series of layers is to consider each layer's thermal resistance and add them up. Oh right, the overall thermal resistance R_total is R1 + R2 + ... for each layer. Then, the heat flux (q/A) is (ΔT) / R_total.

Each R for a layer is (thickness L) divided by (k). But wait, I need to make sure the units are consistent. Oh yeah, because the problem gives the thickness in inches, and k is in ft units. So I should convert inches to feet.

Let me get this straight. The first layer is 6 inches. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, 6 inches is 0.5 feet. Similarly, the second layer is 9 inches, which is 0.75 feet.

So for the first layer, R1 = L1/k1 = 0.5 ft / 0.08 Btu/hr-ft-°F. Let me calculate that. 0.5 divided by 0.08 equals... 6.25 °F·hr·ft²/Btu. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me do the calculation again. 0.5 / 0.08 is 6.25. So R1 is 6.25.

Then the second layer, R2 = L2/k2 = 0.75 / 0.8. Let's see, 0.75 divided by 0.8 is 0.9375. So R2 is 0.9375.

Adding R1 and R2 together gives the total resistance. R_total = 6.25 + 0.9375 = 7.1875 °F·hr·ft²/Btu.

Now, the temperature difference ΔT is T_inner - T_outer. That's 1800°F - 200°F = 1600°F.

The heat flux q/A is ΔT divided by R_total. So q/A = 1600 / 7.1875. Let me compute this. 1600 divided by 7.1875.

Hmm, 7.1875 * 222 is about 1600? Let's see, 7.1875 * 222. Let's compute 7 * 222 = 1554, and 0.1875 * 222 is about 41.625. So total is 1554 + 41.625 = 1595.625. Oh, that's close to 1600. So approximately 222.61. Wait, but wait, wait. Let me do it more accurately.

7.1875 is equal to 7 + 3/16, since 0.1875 is 3/16. So 1600 / (7 + 3/16) = 1600 * (16/111) ) because 7*16=112, 3/16 adds 3, so 115? Wait no, wait. Wait, 7.1875 is 7 + 3/16, which is (7*16 +3)/16 = (112 +3)/16=115/16. So 1600 divided by (115/16) ) is 1600 * (16/115).

Calculate 1600 *16 = 25600. 25600 divided by 115. Let's see, 115 * 222 = 25530. Because 115*200=23,000; 115*22=2530. 23000+2530=25530. So 25600 - 25530 =70. So 222 with a remainder of 70. 70/115 = 0.6087. So 222.6087, approximately 222.61. So q/A is about 222.61 Btu/hr-ft².

Looking at the options, option I is 222.61. So the answer should be I.

To determine the rate of heat loss per unit area through the oven wall, we use the formula for heat transfer through a series of layers:

\[
\frac{q}{A} = \frac{\Delta T}{R_{\text{total}}}
\]

where \( \Delta T \) is the temperature difference across the wall, and \( R_{\text{total}} \) is the total thermal resistance of the wall. The total thermal resistance is the sum of the thermal resistances of the two layers:

\[
R_{\text{total}} = R_1 + R_2
\]

The thermal resistance of each layer is given by:

\[
R = \frac{L}{k}
\]

### Step 1: Convert thickness to consistent units
The thickness of the refractory brick layer is 6 inches, which is \( L_1 = 0.5 \, \text{ft} \). The thickness of the common brick layer is 9 inches, which is \( L_2 = 0.75 \, \text{ft} \).

### Step 2: Calculate thermal resistances
For the refractory brick layer (\( k_1 = 0.08 \, \text{Btu/hr-ft-°F} \)):

\[
R_1 = \frac{L_1}{k_1} = \frac{0.5}{0.08} = 6.25 \, \text{°F·hr·ft}^2\text{/Btu}
\]

For the common brick layer (\( k_2 = 0.8 \, \text{Btu/hr-ft-°F} \)):

\[
R_2 = \frac{L_2}{k_2} = \frac{0.75}{0.8} = 0.9375 \, \text{°F·hr·ft}^2\text{/Btu}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate total thermal resistance
\[
R_{\text{total}} = R_1 + R_2 = 6.25 + 0.9375 = 7.1875 \, \text{°F·hr·ft}^2\text{/Btu}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate temperature difference
The temperature difference across the wall is:

\[
\Delta T = T_{\text{inner}} - T_{\text{outer}} = 1800 \, \text{°F} - 200 \, \text{°F} = 1600 \, \text{°F}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate heat flux
The heat flux per unit area is:

\[
\frac{q}{A} = \frac{\Delta T}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1600}{7.1875}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\frac{q}{A} = 222.61 \, \text{Btu/hr-ft}^2
\]

### Final Answer:
The rate of heat loss per unit area through the wall is approximately **222.61 Btu/hr-ft²**, which corresponds to option **I**.
