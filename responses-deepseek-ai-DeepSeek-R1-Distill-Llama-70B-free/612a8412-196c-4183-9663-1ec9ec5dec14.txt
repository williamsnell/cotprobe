Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out which statement is true. Let me go through each option one by one to understand them better. 

First, I'll recall what each shape is. A trapezoid has at least one pair of parallel sides. A rectangle has four right angles and four sides, all angles 90 degrees. A square is a special kind of rectangle where all sides are equal. A pentagon has five sides, a hexagon six, heptagon seven, octagon eight. A parallelogram has two sets of parallel sides. A rhombus has four sides of equal length, but angles aren't necessarily 90 degrees. A triangle has three sides, and a polygon is any shape with at least three sides. Circles and ovals are different; circles are perfectly round, while ovals are more like stretched circles.

Now, let me look at each option:

Option A: All trapezoids are rectangles because they have at least one pair of parallel sides.
Wait, no. Trapezoids can have just one pair of parallel sides, but rectangles have two pairs (all sides are right angles). So this is incorrect because not all trapezoids meet the criteria for rectangles.

Option B: All pentagons are heptagons because they have more than 4 sides.
No, that doesn't make sense. A pentagon has five sides, a heptagon seven. Just because a shape has more than four sides doesn't change it into a different type. So B is wrong.

Option C: All hexagons are triangles because they have at least 3 sides.
No, a hexagon has six sides, so it's definitely not a triangle, which has three. Having at least three sides doesn't make a hexagon a triangle. C is incorrect.

Option D: All triangles are polygons because they have less than 4 sides.
Wait, a triangle has exactly three sides, which fits the definition of a polygon (at least three sides). So this statement is true. But I'll check the other options just to be sure.

Option E: All rectangles are squares because they have 4 right angles.
No, because a square requires all sides to be equal, whereas a rectangle only needs four right angles. So E is false.

Option F: All octagons are polygons because they have at least 3 sides.
Well, an octagon has eight sides, which is more than three. So yes, this is true. So F is a correct statement.

Option G: All circles are ovals because they have no straight sides.
Hmm, I'm not sure. I think circles are a specific type of oval, but some definitions treat them as distinct. Wait, an oval typically refers to an ellipse, which is a circle stretched out. So a circle is a special case of an oval? Or is it considered different? I might need to think more about this. But I'm not certain, so I'll note that G might be correct or not.

Option H: All parallelograms are rectangles because they have 2 sets of parallel sides.
No, because a parallelogram only needs two sets of parallel sides, but the angles don't have to be 90 degrees. So unless it's a rectangle, which is a special case, H is incorrect.

Option I: All rhombi are squares because they have 4 sides that are all the same length.
No, a rhombus has equal sides but angles that aren't necessarily 90 degrees. A square is a rhombus with right angles. So I is false.

Option J: All squares are quadrilaterals because they have 4 sides.
Yes, because a quadrilateral is a four-sided polygon. Squares fit that definition, so J is correct.

Wait, now I have multiple options that seem correct: D, F, J, and maybe G. But let me go back.

Option D: Triangles are polygons. Yes, because polygon is any shape with at least three sides. So D is correct.

Option F: Octagons (8 sides) are polygons. Definitely correct, as 8 is more than 3.

Option J: Squares are quadrilaterals. Yes, because quadrilaterals have four sides. So J is also correct.

Wait, but the question asks which statement is true, so perhaps more than one option is correct, but looking back at the question, it says "which statement is true," implying only one correct answer. Hmm, but the options are from A to J, and each is a separate statement.

Wait, let me re-examine the options.

Wait, the options are exclusive, so only one is correct.

Looking again:

Option D: All triangles are polygons because they have less than 4 sides. Wait, "less than 4"? Wait, a triangle has exactly 3 sides. So "less than 4" is correct. So D is correct.

Option F: All octagons are polygons because they have at least 3 sides. Yes, octagons have 8 sides, which is ≥3, so F is correct.

Option J: All squares are quadrilaterals because they have 4 sides. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, so now I have D, F, and J as correct statements. But the question says only one is correct. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking at option D: "All triangles are polygons because they have less than 4 sides." Wait, "less than 4" would mean 3 or fewer. But a triangle has exactly 3. So yes, 3 is less than 4. So the statement is correct.

Wait, but some might interpret "less than 4" as excluding 4, but 3 is included. So D is correct.

Similarly, F says octagons are polygons because they have at least 3 sides. That's correct.

J: Squares are quadrilaterals because they have 4 sides. Correct.

So now I'm confused because I have three correct statements, but the options are A-J, and the question asks which is true, implying only one is correct. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting some options.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake with option D. Let me check.

Option D: "All triangles are polygons because they have less than 4 sides."

Wait, a triangle has exactly 3 sides, which is less than 4. So yes, it's a polygon. So D is correct.

But what about option F: "All octagons are polygons because they have at least 3 sides." Since an octagon has 8 sides, which is ≥3, so yes, F is correct.

Option J: "All squares are quadrilaterals because they have 4 sides." Quadrilaterals have four sides, so yes, J is correct.

Wait, this suggests that D, F, and J are correct, but the question must have only one correct answer. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options. Let me review the question again.

Wait, the question says: "Which statement is true?" So perhaps only one of the options is correct. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the exact wording of each option.

Option D says: "All triangles are polygons because they have less than 4 sides." Wait, less than 4 means 3 or fewer. But a triangle has exactly 3, so yes. But wait, "less than 4 sides" includes 3, which is correct. So D is correct.

Option F: "All octagons are polygons because they have at least 3 sides." Yes, since octagons have 8, which is ≥3. So F is correct.

Option J: "All squares are quadrilaterals because they have 4 sides." Yes, because quadrilaterals have four sides. So J is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the answer is only F or J or D.

Wait, the options are A to J, each is a separate statement, so perhaps more than one is correct, but the question is which is true, so perhaps all three are correct. But that can't be because the options are presented as single choice.

Wait, but looking back, perhaps I'm wrong about option D. Wait, the wording is "they have less than 4 sides." So a triangle has exactly 3, which is less than 4. So yes, D is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the question is testing another aspect. For example, in option J, squares are a subset of quadrilaterals, so yes, all squares are quadrilaterals. Similarly, all octagons are polygons. So perhaps the correct answers are D, F, J.

But the question requires me to choose one, so perhaps the intended answer is J. Or maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps some of these options are not correct. Let me think again.

Option D: Triangles are polygons because they have less than 4 sides. Well, a polygon is a plane figure with at least three sides. So yes, triangles qualify. So D is correct.

Option F: Octagons are polygons because they have ≥3 sides. Correct.

Option J: Squares are quadrilaterals because they have four sides. Correct.

So all three are correct, but the question must have only one correct answer. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the options are exclusive, and only one is correct. Let me re-examine each statement.

Wait, perhaps in option D, the reason given is incorrect. The statement says "because they have less than 4 sides." But the definition of a polygon is having at least 3 sides, not less than 4. So a polygon can have 3, 4, 5, etc. So the reason in D is incorrect. Because having less than 4 sides (i.e., 3) makes them polygons, but the reasoning is accurate. Wait, because having 3 sides (which is less than 4) qualifies as a polygon. So the reasoning is correct. So D is correct.

Hmm, this is getting tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is F because it's more universally correct, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think: in the options, perhaps J is the most clearly correct. Because a square is a quadrilateral by definition. Quadrilaterals have four sides, and squares have four. So J is definitely correct.

Similarly, F is correct because octagons have 8 sides, which is ≥3, so they are polygons.

D is correct because triangles have 3 sides, which is ≥3, so they are polygons.

Wait, but the question asks which statement is true, so all three D, F, J are correct. But that can't be the case because the options are A-J, and the user expects a single answer. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding some definitions.

Wait, perhaps in option D, the reason is phrased incorrectly. The statement says "because they have less than 4 sides." But a polygon must have at least 3, so the reason is correct. So D is correct.

Similarly, F and J are correct.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is J because it's the most specific and clearly correct without any ambiguity.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's see the options again:

The correct statements are D, F, J.

But the options are A through J, and the question is multiple-choice, so perhaps more than one is correct, but the options don't allow that. Alternatively, perhaps only one is correct, and I have to choose.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option D. Let me read it again. It says, "All triangles are polygons because they have less than 4 sides." Wait, no, that's not accurate. Because the reason is that they have less than 4, but the actual reason is that they have at least 3. So perhaps the reasoning is incorrect, making the statement incorrect. Because the reason given is not the correct reason for triangles being polygons.

Wait, no. The statement is asserting that triangles are polygons because they have less than 4 sides. But having less than 4 sides isn't the defining feature; it's having at least 3. So the reasoning is correct in that having 3 sides (less than 4) qualifies them as polygons. So D's reasoning is correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think about each option again.

Option J: All squares are quadrilaterals because they have 4 sides. This is definitely correct because quadrilaterals are defined as four-sided polygons, and squares fit that.

Option F: All octagons are polygons because they have at least 3 sides. Correct.

Option D: All triangles are polygons because they have less than 4 sides. Correct.

But the question seems to expect only one correct answer. So perhaps I need to look for other possible errors.

Wait, perhaps in option F, the reasoning is correct, but the statement is more general. So all octagons are indeed polygons, making F correct.

But perhaps the intended answer is J because it's a more specific and clearly correct statement without any ambiguity.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is F because octagons are clearly polygons, and that's a broader statement.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the options that are definitely correct and see which one is among the choices.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is J because it's the most unambiguously correct.

Wait, another approach: sometimes in multiple-choice questions, only one option is correct. So perhaps only one of D, F, J is correct, and the others have subtle errors.

Wait, in option D: The statement says "because they have less than 4 sides." But a triangle has exactly 3 sides, which is less than 4. So the reasoning is correct, and the statement is true.

In option F: Correct.

In option J: Correct.

So all three are correct. But this can't be the case. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is J because it's the only one that's correct, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the answer is F because it's the only one that's correct. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps option J is correct because it's the only one without any ambiguity. Alternatively, perhaps the others have issues.

Wait, perhaps the answer is J. Because squares are indeed quadrilaterals, and that's a fundamental definition.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach this systematically.

Let me list each option and assess its validity:

A: All trapezoids are rectangles. No, because trapezoids only need one pair of parallel sides.

B: All pentagons are heptagons. No, because they have different numbers of sides.

C: All hexagons are triangles. No, hexagons have six sides.

D: All triangles are polygons (because they have less than 4 sides). Yes, correct.

E: All rectangles are squares. No, because rectangles don't need equal sides.

F: All octagons are polygons (because they have ≥3 sides). Yes, correct.

G: All circles are ovals. Maybe, depending on definition, but often circles are considered a type of oval, or not.

H: All parallelograms are rectangles. No, because angles don't have to be right angles.

I: All rhombi are squares. No, because rhombi don't need right angles.

J: All squares are quadrilaterals. Yes, correct.

So options D, F, J are correct. But the question asks which statement is true, implying only one is correct. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the question allows for multiple correct answers, but the options are presented as single letters. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing some options.

Wait, perhaps option D is incorrect because the reason given is not accurate. The statement says "because they have less than 4 sides." But the correct reason is that they have at least 3 sides. So the reasoning in D is incorrect, making the statement incorrect.

Wait, no. Because having less than 4 sides includes 3, which is exactly what a triangle has. So the reasoning is correct, even though the phrasing is "less than 4." So D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question considers that "less than 4" is 1 or 2, but that's not correct. "Less than 4" includes 3, which is correct for a triangle.

Hmm, I'm stuck. But given that the options are presented as single choices, and I have to pick one, perhaps the intended answer is J.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F because it's more universally applicable, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the question is from an educational source, and the intended answer is J because it's a fundamental property.

In conclusion, I think the correct answer is J: All squares are quadrilaterals because they have 4 sides.

To determine which statement is true, let's analyze each option carefully:

**Option A:** "All trapezoids are rectangles because they have at least one pair of parallel sides."  
This is incorrect because a trapezoid only requires one pair of parallel sides, whereas a rectangle requires two pairs of parallel sides and four right angles.

**Option B:** "All pentagons are heptagons because they have more than 4 sides."  
This is incorrect because a pentagon has exactly five sides, while a heptagon has seven sides. The number of sides determines the type of polygon, and they are not interchangeable.

**Option C:** "All hexagons are triangles because they have at least 3 sides."  
This is incorrect because a hexagon has six sides, whereas a triangle has exactly three sides. Having at least three sides does not make a hexagon a triangle.

**Option D:** "All triangles are polygons because they have less than 4 sides."  
This is correct. A polygon is defined as a shape with at least three sides, and a triangle has exactly three sides, which satisfies the definition of a polygon. The reasoning is accurate.

**Option E:** "All rectangles are squares because they have 4 right angles."  
This is incorrect because a rectangle requires four right angles but does not necessarily have all sides of equal length, which is a defining feature of a square.

**Option F:** "All octagons are polygons because they have at least 3 sides."  
This is correct. An octagon has eight sides, which satisfies the definition of a polygon (a shape with at least three sides). The reasoning is accurate.

**Option G:** "All circles are ovals because they have no straight sides."  
This is debatable. While circles and ovals are both curved shapes, a circle is a special case of an oval where the curvature is constant. However, in some definitions, circles are considered distinct from ovals. This makes the statement ambiguous.

**Option H:** "All parallelograms are rectangles because they have 2 sets of parallel sides."  
This is incorrect because a parallelogram requires two sets of parallel sides but does not necessarily have four right angles, which is required for a rectangle.

**Option I:** "All rhombi are squares because they have 4 sides that are all the same length."  
This is incorrect because a rhombus has four sides of equal length but does not necessarily have four right angles, which is required for a square.

**Option J:** "All squares are
