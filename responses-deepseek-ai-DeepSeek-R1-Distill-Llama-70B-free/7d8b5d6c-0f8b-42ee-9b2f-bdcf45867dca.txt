Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"XI. As the present sciences are useless for the discovery of effects, so the present system of logic is useless for the discovery of the sciences.
XIX. There are and can exist but two ways of investigating and discovering truth. The one hurries on rapidly from the senses and particulars to the most general axioms, and from them, as principles and their supposed indisputable truth, derives and discovers the intermediate axioms. This is the way now in use. The other constructs its axioms from the senses and particulars, by ascending continually and gradually, till it finally arrives at the most general axioms, which is the true but unattempted way.
XXII. Each of these two ways begins from the senses and particulars, and ends in the greatest generalities&â€¦
XXXVI. We have but one simple method of delivering our sentiments, namely, we must bring men to particulars and their regular series and order, and they must for a while renounce their notions, and begin to form an acquaintance with things."
Francis Bacon, English philosopher and essayist, Novum Organum, 1620
By the 1800s, the method of empirical reasoning reflected in the passage had undergone which of the following changes?

Options:

A: It had been expanded upon to include non-empirical forms of reasoning.
B: It had become a core principle of European culture.
C: It had stagnated to the point that the common person had begun to search for a new organizing principle of life.
D: It was only used in select areas of academic study.
E: It had been replaced entirely by a different method of reasoning.
F: It had become so widely accepted that it was no longer questioned.
G: It had weakened to the point of irrelevance.
H: It had been refined and changed by so many people that it had become unrecognizable to those such as Bacon who had pioneered it.
I: It had been altered to incorporate religious beliefs into the scientific process.
J: It had been completely dismissed by the scientific community.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Francis Bacon's ideas and how they changed by the 1800s. Let me start by understanding the passage given.

From the passage, Bacon talks about two methods of investigating truth. The first method quickly moves from particulars to general axioms and then uses those as principles to find intermediate axioms. He calls this the current method, but he's criticizing it. The second method is his proposed way, where you build up from the senses and particulars gradually to reach the most general axioms. He emphasizes that this is the true but unattempted way.

So Bacon is advocating for an empirical approach, starting from observations and building up through induction. His method is about collecting data and then forming general principles from there, rather than the deductive approach which starts with general principles and applies them to specifics.

Now, the question is about how this method of empirical reasoning had changed by the 1800s. The options are from A to J.

I think about the historical context. Bacon's work in the 17th century was a big part of the scientific revolution. His emphasis on empirical methods and induction laid the groundwork for modern science. By the 19th century, the scientific method was well-established, and empiricism was a cornerstone.

So, looking at the options, I need to see which change fits. Option B says it had become a core principle of European culture. That makes sense because by the 1800s, the scientific method was widely accepted and influential beyond just science, affecting philosophy and culture. The Enlightenment and the rise of scientific thought would have made empirical reasoning central.

Option F says it was so widely accepted that it was no longer questioned. While it was widely accepted, I think there was still discussion and refinement. Also, other methods like deductivism might have still had their place, but empiricism was dominant.

Option H suggests it was refined so much it became unrecognizable. I don't think that's right because the core idea of empiricism and induction remained, even if methods evolved.

Option B seems the best fit because the empirical method became a foundational aspect of European culture, influencing not just science but other areas like education and social thought.

The question asks about the changes in Francis Bacon's empirical reasoning method by the 1800s. Bacon's approach emphasized building knowledge from observations and particulars through induction, which was revolutionary in his time. By the 19th century, this method had become a cornerstone of scientific practice and European intellectual culture. 

Among the options, B stands out because it accurately reflects how empirical reasoning became a core principle of European culture, influencing various fields beyond science. Other options, like F or H, are less precise, as empiricism remained recognizable and was still subject to refinement rather than being unrecognizable or unquestioned.

Answer: B
