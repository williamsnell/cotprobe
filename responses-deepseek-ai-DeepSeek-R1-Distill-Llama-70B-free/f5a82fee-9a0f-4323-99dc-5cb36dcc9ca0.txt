Alright, so I have this question about who was the first First Lady to run for political office. Hmm, okay, I need to think through this step by step. Let me start by recalling what I know about the First Ladies and their involvement in politics.

First, I remember that Hillary Clinton was very politically active. She was the First Lady when her husband Bill Clinton was president. After that, she went on to have her own political career. I think she became a Senator and then Secretary of State. So she definitely ran for office, but was she the first?

Wait, the question is asking who was the first. So maybe someone before her did that. Let me think about other First Ladies. Eleanor Roosevelt comes to mind. She was very influential, but I don't recall her running for office herself. She was more of a spokesperson and advocate, but maybe she held some positions? I'm not sure.

Then there's Jacqueline Kennedy. She was a First Lady known for her style and restoring the White House, but I don't think she ever ran for office. Same with Nancy Reagan; she was involved in the 'Just Say No' campaign but didn't run for office herself.

What about the others? Barbara Bush, Laura Bush, Michelle Obama—they were all First Ladies but I don't think any of them ran for office. Rosalynn Carter was also quite active in mental health issues, but did she run for office? I'm not sure. Bess Truman—she was the wife of Harry Truman, but I don't think she ran for anything after being First Lady.

Wait, I think I remember something about Hillary Clinton being the first First Lady to run for office. She was elected as a Senator from New York in 2000, which was after her time as First Lady ended in 1999. So she was the first to do that. But the question is, was there a First Lady before her who ran for office?

Let me think again. Maybe someone from earlier times. Oh, wait—Eleanor Roosevelt. She was a delegate to the United Nations, which is an appointed position, not an elected one. So that doesn't count as running for office.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up some facts. There's a First Lady who actually ran for office before Hillary. Oh, wait, no, maybe not. Let me try to think of others. There's also Pat Nixon, but I don't think she ran. Then there's Lady Bird Johnson, but she didn't run either.

Wait, I think the answer is Hillary Clinton. She was the first First Lady to run for and win public office. So looking at the options, option I is Hillary Clinton.
