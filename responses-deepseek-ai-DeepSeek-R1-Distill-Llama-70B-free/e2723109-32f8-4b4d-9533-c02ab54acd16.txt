Okay, so I have this question about Raggedy Ann's doll brother. I'm not super familiar with all the details about Raggedy Ann, but I remember she's a classic doll character. Let me think. Raggedy Ann is a beloved character, and I think she has a brother. I'm trying to recall the name—it's something with Raggedy, I believe. 

Wait, I've heard of Raggedy Andy before. Or was that another character? Maybe I'm confusing it with something else. Let me break it down. Raggedy Ann is the sister, so her brother would logically have a similar name. Raggedy something. 

I remember that Raggedy Andy is a character in some stories or maybe even in the toys. So, if the options include Andy, that might be it. Looking at the options, option G is Andy. But I should check the other options to be sure. 

Let me go through each option:

A: Raggedy Sam – doesn't ring a bell.
B: Randy – possible, but I don't recall.
C: Red – no, that's too short and common.
D: Raggedy Bob – no, not sure.
E: Raggedy Ed – maybe, but I think it's Andy.
F: Raggedy Ken – sounds like Barbie's Ken, but not related.
G: Andy – this seems right because I've heard Raggedy Andy mentioned.
H: Raggedy Jim – nope.
I: Raggedy Tom – that's a different character, maybe a cat.
J: Freckles – doesn't fit.

So, the correct answer should be G: Andy. I think that's Raggedy Ann's brother. I'm pretty confident because I remember seeing Raggedy Andy in some context, maybe in a toy store or a story.

The correct answer is G: Andy, as Raggedy Andy is the known brother of Raggedy Ann.
