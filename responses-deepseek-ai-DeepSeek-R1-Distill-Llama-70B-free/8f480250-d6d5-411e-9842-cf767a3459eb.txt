Alright, so I've got this problem here where Minnie Morello is trying to decide between investing in savings bonds or mutual funds. Let me try to break this down step by step.

Okay, first, she's considering investing $5,000. The savings bonds are for 5 years with an interest rate of 5 and a half percent. I think that's 5.5%. So, I need to calculate how much she'd make from the bonds over five years.

Wait, wait. Savings bonds typically accrue interest annually, right? So I should probably use the formula for compound interest. The formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:
- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- P is the principal amount ($5,000 here).
- r is the annual interest rate (decimal form, so 0.055).
- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year (I think for savings bonds, it's usually annually, so n=1).
- t is the time the money is invested for in years (5 years).

So plugging in the numbers: A = 5000*(1 + 0.055/1)^(1*5). Let me compute that. 1 + 0.055 is 1.055. 1.055 to the power of 5... Hmm, I'm not exactly sure of the exact value, but I can approximate it. Alternatively, maybe I should just compute each year's interest.

Wait, another approach: since it's compound interest, each year's interest is calculated on the principal plus any previously accumulated interest. So for each year, the amount would be multiplied by 1.055. So over 5 years, it's 5000 * (1.055)^5.

Let me calculate (1.055)^5. Let me think, 1.055 squared is about 1.113. Then 1.113 * 1.055 is approximately 1.173 after three years. Fourth year: 1.173 * 1.055 ≈ 1.238. Fifth year: 1.238 * 1.055 ≈ 1.308. So after 5 years, the amount would be 5000 * 1.308, which is $6,540. So the interest earned is 6,540 - 5,000 = $1,540.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I multiplied correctly. Let me try a different approach. Maybe using the rule of 72 or another estimation. Alternatively, maybe I should just use the formula directly. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the total interest and see what rate the mutual fund needs to match that.

Alternatively, maybe the question is simpler. The projected return from the bonds is 5.5% per annum, but the mutual fund has a fee. So we need to find the rate that after paying the fee, the return equals the bond's return.

Wait, no, the problem says that the mutual fund charges a fee of 5 and 8/10 percent. Wait, 5.8%? Because 8/10 is 0.8, so 5.8% fee. So when she invests, she pays 5.8% of the amount as a fee. So she's paying that upfront, I suppose.

So, the mutual fund requires an initial fee of 5.8% of the investment. So she's investing $5,000, but the fee is 5.8% of that. Let me calculate that. 5.8% of 5000 is 0.058 * 5000 = $290. So she pays $290 as a fee, and the remaining amount is invested. So the amount she actually invests in the mutual fund is 5000 - 290 = $4,710.

Now, the mutual fund needs to generate the same return as the savings bonds. So the $4,710 needs to grow to the same future value as the $5,000 in the bonds.

The bonds' future value is $6,540 as I calculated earlier. So the mutual fund's investment must also reach $6,540 in 5 years.

So, let me denote the mutual fund's rate as r. The formula for compound interest again is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt). Here, P is $4,710, A is $6,540, n=1 (annual compounding), t=5.

Plugging in the numbers: 6540 = 4710*(1 + r)^5.

Divide both sides by 4710: 6540/4710 = (1 + r)^5.

Compute 6540 ÷ 4710. Let me see, 4710 * 1.38 is roughly 4710*1.3=6113, 4710*0.08=376.8, so 6113+376.8=6489.6. Close to 6540. So approximately 1.385.

Wait, exact calculation: 6540 ÷ 4710 = let me compute 4710 × 1.385 is 4710*1=4710, 4710*.3=1413, 4710*.08=376.8, 4710*.005=23.55. So 4710 + 1413=6123, +376.8=6499.8, +23.55=6523.35. Hmm, that's close to 6540. So maybe the ratio is about 1.385, but maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, let me calculate 6540 / 4710.

Let me do the division step by step.

4710 goes into 6540 once (4710), subtract, remainder is 1830.

Bring down a zero: 18300. 4710 ×3=14130, so 3 times, remainder 18300-14130=4170.

Bring down zero: 41700. 4710 ×8=37680, which is less than 41700. 41700-37680=4020.

Bring down zero: 40200. 4710 ×8=37680 again. Subtract: 40200-37680=2520.

Bring down zero: 25200. 4710 ×5=23550. Subtract: 25200-23550=1650.

So the division is approximately 1.3857.

So, (1 + r)^5 = 1.3857.

To find r, take the fifth root of 1.3857.

I know that (1.055)^5 is about 1.308, which was the bond's growth. But we need 1.3857.

So, let's compute what rate r would make (1 + r)^5 = 1.3857.

Let me try r = 0.07 (7%).

(1.07)^5 = ?

1.07^2 = 1.1449
1.07^3 = 1.1449 * 1.07 ≈ 1.2250
1.07^4 ≈ 1.2250 * 1.07 ≈ 1.3108
1.07^5 ≈ 1.3108 * 1.07 ≈ 1.4025.

Hmm, 1.4025 is higher than 1.3857. So 7% gives a higher value than needed.

What about 6.77%? That's option F.

Wait, let me compute 1.0677^5.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use logarithms.

Taking natural logs on both sides:

ln(1.3857) = 5 * ln(1 + r).

So, ln(1.3857) ≈ 0.3263.

So, 0.3263 /5 ≈ 0.06526.

Then, exponentiate: e^0.06526 ≈ 1.0672.

Wait, wait. Let me compute this more accurately.

Wait, let me calculate ln(1.3857). Let me use a calculator approach.

I know that ln(1.3) ≈ 0.2624, ln(1.35)=0.3001, ln(1.386)=0.3263 (since e^0.326 ≈1.385).

Wait, yes, e^0.326 is approximately 1.385. So ln(1.3857) is about 0.3263.

So, 0.3263 divided by 5 is 0.06526.

Then, e^0.06526 is approximately 1.0672, because e^0.06 is about 1.0618, e^0.07 is about 1.0725. So 0.06526 is between 0.06 and 0.07.

Let me compute 0.06526.

We can use the Taylor series for e^x around x=0.06.

Alternatively, perhaps use linear approximation between 0.06 and 0.07.

e^0.06 ≈1.0618

e^0.07≈1.0725

The difference is 0.0107 over 0.01 change in x.

We have x=0.06526, which is 0.06526 -0.06=0.00526 above 0.06.

So the fraction is 0.00526 /0.01 = 0.526.

So e^0.06526 ≈1.0618 + 0.526*(0.0107) ≈1.0618 + 0.00563 ≈1.0674.

So approximately 6.74%. Hmm, but let me check the options. Option F is 6.77%. Close to this.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the fee. Let me double-check that.

The fee is 5 and 8/10 percent. 8/10 is 0.8, so 5.8%. So fee is 5.8% of $5000. So 0.058*5000= $290. So the amount invested is 5000-290=4710. Correct.

The future value from the bond is 5000*(1.055)^5. Let me compute that more accurately.

Compute (1.055)^5:

1.055^1 = 1.055

1.055^2 = 1.055 *1.055 = let's compute this.

1.055 * 1.055:

1 *1 =1

1 *0.055=0.055

0.055*1=0.055

0.055*0.055=0.003025

Adding up: 1 + 0.055 +0.055 +0.003025 = 1.113025.

So 1.055^2 = 1.113025.

1.055^3 = 1.113025 *1.055.

Compute 1.113025 *1.055:

Let me compute 1.113025 *1 = 1.113025

1.113025 *0.05 = 0.05565125

1.113025 *0.005=0.005565125

Adding together: 1.113025 +0.05565125=1.16867625 +0.005565125=1.174241375.

So 1.055^3 ≈1.174241.

1.055^4 = 1.174241 *1.055.

Compute 1.174241 *1.055:

1.174241 *1 =1.174241

1.174241 *0.05 =0.05871205

1.174241 *0.005=0.005871205

Adding up: 1.174241 +0.05871205=1.232953 +0.005871205≈1.238824.

So 1.055^4≈1.238824.

1.055^5 =1.238824 *1.055.

Compute 1.238824 *1.055:

1.238824 *1 =1.238824

1.238824 *0.05=0.0619412

1.238824 *0.005=0.00619412

Total:1.238824 +0.0619412=1.3007652 +0.00619412≈1.306959.

So 1.055^5≈1.306959.

So the future value is 5000*1.306959≈5000*1.306959= $6534.795, approximately $6,534.80.

Wait, earlier I thought it was 6,540, but more accurately, it's about 6,534.80.

So mutual fund's future value must reach $6,534.80.

Mutual fund's principal after fee: 4710.

So 4710*(1 + r)^5 =6534.80.

Divide both sides by 4710: (6534.80 /4710) = (1 + r)^5.

Compute 6534.8 /4710. Let's do that:

4710 *1=4710, subtract from 6534.8 gives 1824.8.

Bring down a zero: 18248. 4710 *3=14130, subtract, remainder 4118.

Bring down zero: 41180. 4710 *8=37680, subtract, remainder 3500.

Bring down zero: 35000. 4710 *7=32970, subtract, remainder 2030.

So the division is approximately 1.385, same as before.

Wait, so same as before, 1.385. So (1 + r)^5=1.385.

Taking natural logs: ln(1.385)≈0.3263.

So 0.3263=5*ln(1 + r) => ln(1 +r)=0.06526.

e^0.06526≈1.0672, so r≈6.72%.

Looking at the options, option F is 6.77%, which is close but a bit higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mutual fund's future value. Let me check again.

Wait, the mutual fund's investment is 4710, and it needs to grow to 6534.80 in 5 years.

So 4710 * (1 + r)^5 =6534.80.

Compute (6534.80 /4710) = approx 1.385.

So (1 + r)^5=1.385.

Let me compute 1.385^(1/5):

I can try calculating 1.067^5.

1.067^2 = 1.067 *1.067 = 1.138889.

1.067^3 = 1.138889 *1.067 ≈1.138889 +0.076666≈1.21555.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

1.138889 *1.067:

1.138889 *1 =1.138889

1.138889 *0.06=0.068333

1.138889 *0.007=0.007967.

Adding: 1.138889 +0.068333=1.207222 +0.007967≈1.215189.

So 1.067^3≈1.21519.

1.067^4=1.21519 *1.067.

Compute 1.21519 *1=1.21519

1.21519 *0.06=0.07291

1.21519 *0.007=0.008505.

Adding: 1.21519 +0.07291=1.2881 +0.008505≈1.296605.

So 1.067^4≈1.2966.

1.067^5=1.2966 *1.067.

Compute 1.2966 *1=1.2966

1.2966 *0.06=0.077796

1.2966 *0.007=0.009076.

Adding: 1.2966 +0.077796=1.374396 +0.009076≈1.383472.

So 1.067^5≈1.3835, which is just a bit less than 1.385. So r=6.67% would give approximately 1.3835. We need 1.385, which is a bit higher.

What about r=6.77%? Let's compute 1.0677^5.

Compute step by step:

1.0677^2 = 1.0677 *1.0677.

Let me compute:

1.0677 *1.0677:

1*1=1

1*.0677=0.0677

.0677*1=0.0677

.0677*.0677≈0.004583.

So adding up:

1 +0.0677 +0.0677=1.1354 +0.004583≈1.139983.

So 1.0677^2≈1.139983.

1.0677^3=1.139983 *1.0677.

Compute:

1.139983 *1 =1.139983

1.139983 *0.06=0.06839898

1.139983 *0.0077≈0.008773.

Adding:

1.139983 +0.068399=1.208382 +0.008773≈1.217155.

So 1.0677^3≈1.217155.

1.0677^4=1.217155 *1.0677.

Compute:

1.217155 *1=1.217155

1.217155 *0.06=0.0730293

1.217155 *0.0077≈0.009379.

Adding: 1.217155 +0.0730293=1.290184 +0.009379≈1.299563.

1.0677^4≈1.299563.

1.0677^5=1.299563 *1.0677.

Compute:

1.299563 *1=1.299563

1.299563 *0.06=0.0779738

1.299563 *0.0077≈0.010000.

Adding: 1.299563 +0.0779738=1.3775368 +0.010000≈1.3875368.

So 1.0677^5≈1.3875, which is just a bit above 1.385. So that suggests that at 6.77%, the mutual fund's investment would grow to about $4,710 * 1.3875 ≈4,710 *1.3875.

Wait, 4,710 *1.3875. Let me compute that.

4,710 *1 =4,710.
