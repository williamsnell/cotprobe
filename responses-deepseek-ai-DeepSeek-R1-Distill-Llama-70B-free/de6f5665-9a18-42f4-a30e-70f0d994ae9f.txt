Okay, so I need to figure out which dwarf planet is closest to the Sun. Hmm, I remember that dwarf planets are a category of celestial bodies in our solar system, and they include Pluto, which I know is the most famous one. But I'm not sure about their distances from the Sun.

Wait, I think Ceres is a dwarf planet too. Oh right, Ceres is the only one in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. That's probably closer to the Sun than the others, which are in the outer solar system or the Kuiper Belt. Let me think about the others.

Eris is another dwarf planet, I believe, and I think it's beyond Pluto's orbit, so it's probably farther from the Sun. Pluto is in the Kuiper Belt, so it's pretty far out. Then there's Haumea, Makemake, and others like that, which are also in the Kuiper Belt, so they're definitely not the closest.

Sedna has a very elongated orbit, but I'm not sure if it's closer than Ceres. No, wait, Sedna is way out there, way beyond Pluto. So that's not it either.

Wait, Ceres is much closer. Let me see, the order of planets from the Sun is Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, then the asteroid belt where Ceres is. Then comes Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and beyond that, the Kuiper Belt with Pluto and other dwarf planets.

So among the dwarf planets, Ceres is in the asteroid belt, which is between Mars and Jupiter. That's much closer to the Sun than all the others. So the closest dwarf planet to the Sun must be Ceres.

Looking at the options, option G is Ceres. So the answer should be G.

The dwarf planet closest to the Sun is Ceres, which resides in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Other dwarf planets like Pluto, Eris, and Haumea are located in the outer solar system or the Kuiper Belt, making Ceres the closest.
