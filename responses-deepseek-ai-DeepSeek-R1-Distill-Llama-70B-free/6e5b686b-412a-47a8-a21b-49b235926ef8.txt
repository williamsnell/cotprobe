Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I need to figure out which formula correctly symbolizes the given sentence. The sentence is, "If Beth rides her bike, she gets to work earlier." Hmm, let's break this down.

Alright, first, I should identify the propositions involved. Let me assign some variables. Let's say B stands for "Beth rides her bike," and W stands for "she gets to work earlier." So the original sentence is saying that if B happens, then W happens. That sounds like a conditional statement.

In logic, a conditional is usually written as B → W. But I don't see that symbol in the options. Wait, I remember that in propositional logic, the implication B → W is equivalent to ¬B ∨ W. So I can look for that form in the options.

Looking at the options provided:

Option A: W ∨ B. That would mean either she gets to work earlier or she rides her bike. But the original statement is about if she rides, then she gets to work earlier. So this might not capture the correct implication.

Option B: B ⊃ W. Oh wait, in logic, ⊃ is the symbol for implication, so B ⊃ W is exactly B → W. That looks promising because the sentence is in the form "if B then W."

Option C: B ∨ W. Similar to A, but without the negation. That's just B or W, which doesn't represent the conditional.

Option D: ¬B ⊃ W. This would mean if Beth does not ride her bike, then she gets to work earlier. That doesn't match the original statement, which is about when she does ride.

Option E: W ⊃ B. This flips the implication. It would mean if she gets to work earlier, then she rides her bike. But the original is the other way around.

Option F: ¬W ⊃ B. This would be "if she doesn't get to work earlier, then she rides her bike." That's the contrapositive, but not the direct implication we're looking for.

Option G: B ≡ ¬W. Equivalence between B and not W. That would mean riding her bike is the same as not getting to work earlier, which contradicts the original statement.

Option H: B ≡ W. This suggests that riding her bike is equivalent to getting to work earlier. But the original is a one-way implication, not an equivalence.

Option I: B & W. This is a conjunction, meaning both B and W are true. But the original statement doesn't say both happen; it's about the implication.

Option J: Both A and B. So this would mean both W∨B and B→W are correct. But from earlier, I thought B→W is the correct symbolization, which is option B. Option A is W∨B, which might not be the same as B→W unless considering the equivalence.

Wait a second, I remember that B→W is logically equivalent to ¬B∨W. So if the options include that, that would be the same as B⊃W. Looking back, option B is B⊃W, which is exactly the implication. So the correct answer should be B, right?

But wait, let me check the options again. Oh, option A is W∨B, which is W∨B, not ¬B∨W. So that's different. So option B is the correct one as it directly represents the implication.

The sentence "If Beth rides her bike, she gets to work earlier" is a conditional statement. Letting **B** represent "Beth rides her bike" and **W** represent "she gets to work earlier," the sentence can be symbolized as **B → W**. 

In propositional logic, the implication **B → W** is equivalent to **¬B ∨ W**. However, the options provided do not include **¬B ∨ W**, so we look for the closest match. The symbol **⊃** represents implication, and **B ⊃ W** directly captures the meaning of the sentence. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A: W ∨ B** — This represents "she gets to work earlier or she rides her bike," which does not capture the conditional relationship.
- **B: B ⊃ W** — This is the correct symbolization of "If B, then W."
- **C: B ∨ W** — Similar to A, this does not represent the conditional.
- **D: ¬B ⊃ W** — This means "If Beth does not ride her bike, she gets to work earlier," which is incorrect.
- **E: W ⊃ B** — This flips the implication, meaning "If she gets to work earlier, she rides her bike," which is not the original statement.
- **F: ¬W ⊃ B** — This is the contrapositive and not the direct implication.
- **G: B ≡ ¬W** — This suggests equivalence between riding her bike and not getting to work earlier, which is incorrect.
- **H: B ≡ W** — This implies equivalence between riding her bike and getting to work earlier, which is not the case.
- **I: B & W** — This represents a conjunction, meaning both B and W are true, which is not the original statement.
- **J: Both A and B** — This is incorrect because A does not symbolize the conditional.

The correct answer is **B: B ⊃ W**, as it directly represents the conditional statement "If Beth rides her bike, she gets to work earlier."

Answer: B
