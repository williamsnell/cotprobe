Question:

The state has the following statutes regarding liquor sales in effect:"Section 1212. Whoever sells intoxicating liquor to any person who is intoxicated or inebriated is guilty of a misdemeanor. This section shall not apply in the case of sales of intoxicating liquor by a hotel, motel, or inn to any person registered and resident as a guest in such hotel, motel, or inn for consumption upon the premises thereof. ""Section 1213. It shall be unlawful for any vendor with a valid state liquor license to sell intoxicating beverages on Sunday. Anyone in violation of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and fined not less than $100 or more than $1,000. "The state authorities have regularly enforced the aforementioned dram shop statute and "blue law" prohibiting Sunday liquor sales. At 12:30 a. m. on Sunday morning, a customer entered a liquor store and purchased a bottle of wine. The clerk who made the sale, thought the time was 11:30 p. m. Saturday night because that was the time shown on the store's wall clock. Unknown to the clerk, the clock was malfunctioning and was running an hour behind. Thus, the clock displayed the wrong time when the clerk sold the wine to the customer. When the clerk made the sale, the customer did not appear to be visibly inebriated. After making the purchase, the customer drank the entire bottle of wine. He then drove off in his car and struck a pedestrian, injuring him. At the time of the accident, the customer was intoxicated from drinking the wine. If the pedestrian asserts a claim against the liquor store, will the plaintiff prevail?

Options:

A: Yes, because the accident would not have occurred but for the sale of the wine to the customer.
B: No, because the clerk did not violate the dram shop statute, and his violation of the "blue law" resulted from the clock's malfunctioning.
C: No, because the customer did not appear to be visibly inebriated when he purchased the wine.
D: Yes, because the liquor store was negligent per se by selling the wine in violation of the "blue law" prohibiting Sunday liquor sales.
E: No, because the purpose of the "blue law" prohibiting Sunday liquor sales was not to prevent accidents caused by drivers driving while intoxicated.
F: Yes, because the clerk should have been aware of the correct time regardless of the store's clock.
G: Yes, because the store should have a system in place to ensure the accuracy of the time.
H: No, because the pedestrian was not the direct victim of the violation of the "blue law."
I: Yes, because the clock's malfunctioning is not a valid excuse for violating the "blue law."
J: No, because the customer was already intoxicated before the purchase was made.

Okay, so I have this legal question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about liquor sales statutes and a possible dram shop liability. There are two sections mentioned: 1212 and 1213.

Section 1212 makes it a misdemeanor to sell liquor to an intoxicated person, but it doesn't apply to hotels, motels, or inns selling to their guests for on-premises consumption. So, that's the dram shop law.

Section 1213 is a blue law prohibiting liquor sales on Sundays. Violating this can lead to a fine. The state enforces both laws.

Now, the scenario: A customer enters a liquor store at 12:30 a.m. on Sunday morning and buys wine. The clerk thought it was 11:30 p.m. Saturday because the store's clock was malfunctioning and was an hour behind. So, the clerk didn't know it was already Sunday.

The customer didn't appear visibly intoxicated when buying the wine. After buying, he drank the whole bottle, then drove and hit a pedestrian, injuring them. At the time of the accident, the customer was intoxicated from the wine.

The question is whether the pedestrian can successfully sue the liquor store.

I need to think about the possible causes of action here. The main ones would be under the dram shop act (section 1212) and possibly negligence per se from violating the blue law (section 1213).

First, looking at the dram shop statute. The clerk sold to the customer who wasn't visibly intoxicated at the time, so section 1212 doesn't apply because the sale wasn't to an intoxicated person. So, the store might not be liable under the dram shop law.

Next, the blue law. The clerk sold the wine on Sunday, which is prohibited. But wait, the clerk thought it was Saturday night because the clock was wrong. So, the clerk didn't intend to break the law. But does intent matter here? The blue law seems to be a strict liability offenseâ€”meaning that intent doesn't matter; just the act of selling on Sunday is enough.

If the sale was in violation of section 1213, then the store could be negligent per se. Negligent per se means that the statute was violated, which establishes a duty and breach, and if the harm is what the statute was meant to prevent, then liability follows.

What's the purpose of the blue law? Historically, blue laws were for religious reasons, but in modern times, sometimes they're about public safety. But the question is whether the statute's purpose was to prevent drunk driving accidents. I'm not sure. The blue law here just prohibits Sunday sales. The dram shop law is more about preventing sales to intoxicated people to prevent harm.

So, if the store violated the blue law, and that led to the customer buying the wine, then getting intoxicated, and causing an accident, does that mean the blue law's purpose was to prevent such accidents? Or was it just to enforce a day of rest or religious observance?

If the statute's purpose was not to prevent drunk driving, then the store's violation wouldn't support a claim of negligence per se. Because for negligence per se, the plaintiff's harm must be the type the statute was intended to prevent.

Alternatively, if the store sold the liquor illegally on Sunday, and that sale caused the customer to drink and drive, then maybe the store is liable under negligence per se.

Wait, but the blue law's purpose isn't necessarily to prevent drunk driving. It's more about controlling when liquor is sold. So, maybe the store's violation doesn't directly relate to the harm caused by the intoxicated driver.

Another angle: The customer was not intoxicated when he bought the wine, so the store isn't liable under the dram shop law. But selling on Sunday was a violation, which led to the sale, which led to the accident. But the problem is whether the blue law's purpose was to prevent such accidents. If not, then the store isn't negligent per se because the statute doesn't speak to that harm.

So, the options are looking at whether the store is liable under either law.

Looking at the options:

A: But-for sale caused the accident. But but-for is about causation, but the question is about whether the store is liable, which depends on the statutes.

B: Clerk didn't violate dram shop (correct, customer wasn't intoxicated), and blue law violation was due to clock malfunction. But strict liability, so intent doesn't matter. So, B might not be correct because the clerk's mistake of fact (clock) might not excuse the violation.

C: Customer not visibly intoxicated, so dram shop doesn't apply. But the question is about whether the store is liable under another theory, like blue law.

D: Store negligent per se for violating blue law. But if the statute's purpose isn't to prevent such accidents, this might not apply.

E: Purpose of blue law wasn't to prevent accidents, so no liability. This could be a possible correct answer.

F: Clerk should have known the correct time regardless of the clock. Maybe, but if the clock was the only timepiece, maybe not. But blue law is strict liability, so mistake of fact might not matter.

G: Store should have a system for accurate time. Again, strict liability, so maybe not an excuse.

H: Pedestrian not direct victim. Not sure what this means. The blue law's violation affects the sale, which led to the accident. The pedestrian is an injured third party.

I: Clock malfunction is no excuse. Because blue law is strict liability, so yes, this would make the store liable. So I says yes.

J: Customer was already intoxicated. But the scenario says the customer didn't appear intoxicated when buying, and only became intoxicated after drinking the wine bought.

So, the possible options are D, E, I, maybe others.

Wait, the question is about whether the pedestrian will prevail. So, if the store is found liable under negligence per se, the pedestrian would win. But if the blue law's purpose isn't to prevent drunk driving, then negligence per se doesn't apply. So the store's only violation is the blue law, but that doesn't necessarily lead to liability for the accident.

In that case, the answer would be E: No, because the purpose wasn't to prevent accidents. So the store isn't liable under negligence per se.

Alternatively, some might argue that the blue law contributes to reducing the availability of alcohol, thus reducing drunk driving, so the purpose could be seen as related. But I'm not sure; blue laws are more about the day of sale than about preventing intoxication.

So, perhaps the correct answer is E.

Wait, but another thought: If the store wasn't allowed to sell on Sundays, then the sale wouldn't have happened. So, but for the blue law violation, the accident wouldn't have occurred. But if the blue law's purpose isn't to prevent such accidents, then the store isn't liable under negligence per se.

So, the pedestrian can't claim under the dram shop act because the customer wasn't intoxicated at purchase, and can't claim under the blue law because the law wasn't meant to prevent this type of harm.

Therefore, the pedestrian's claim would fail.

Looking at the options, E says no because the blue law's purpose wasn't to prevent accidents. So the answer would be E.

Wait, but the options: Option D says yes because negligent per se. So if the blue law's purpose was to prevent such harm, D would be correct. But if not, E is correct.

I think the blue law's purpose is more about controlling the days of sale, not specifically preventing drunk driving. Drunk driving prevention is more the purpose of the dram shop law.

So, the store's violation of the blue law led to the sale, but since the blue law's purpose isn't to prevent the resulting harm (the accident), the store isn't negligent per se. Therefore, the pedestrian can't recover.

Thus, the correct answer would be E.

The question revolves around whether the pedestrian can prevail in a claim against the liquor store based on the state's dram shop statute (Section 1212) and blue law (Section 1213). The key analysis focuses on whether the store can be held liable under either statute.

1. **Dram Shop Statute (Section 1212):** This statute imposes liability for selling liquor to an intoxicated person. However, the customer did not appear visibly intoxicated at the time of the sale, so the store did not violate this statute. Therefore, the store cannot be held liable under the dram shop law.

2. **Blue Law (Section 1213):** The store violated this statute by selling liquor on Sunday. The clerk's mistaken belief about the time due to a malfunctioning clock does not excuse the violation, as the blue law is a strict liability offense. However, for the store to be liable under negligence per se, the harm caused (the pedestrian's injury) must be the type of harm the statute was intended to prevent.

3. **Purpose of the Blue Law:** The blue law's primary purpose is to regulate the days on which liquor can be sold, often rooted in historical or religious reasons, rather than specifically to prevent accidents caused by intoxicated drivers. Since the statute's purpose does not align with the harm in this case, the store cannot be held liable under negligence per se.

4. **Causation and Strict Liability:** While the sale on Sunday led to the accident, the blue law's purpose was not to prevent such accidents. Therefore, the store's violation of the blue law does not establish liability for the pedestrian's injuries.

Given this analysis, the pedestrian cannot prevail in their claim against the liquor store.

**Answer: E**
