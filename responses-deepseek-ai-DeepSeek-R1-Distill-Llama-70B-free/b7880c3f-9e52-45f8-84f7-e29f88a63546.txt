Okay, so I have this logic problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to predicate logic, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is: "Some CEO is wealthier than everyone." And I need to translate that into predicate logic using the given symbols. The options are from A to J.

The predicates given are:
- Cx: x is a CEO
- Px: x is a person
- Wxy: x is wealthier than y

Hmm, so the sentence is saying that there exists a CEO who is wealthier than every person. Wait, but the wording is "everyone," so I think that refers to every person. So, the structure should involve an existential quantifier for the CEO and a universal quantifier for the people.

Let me break it down. The original statement is "Some CEO is wealthier than everyone." So, in logic terms, that would be: There exists an x such that x is a CEO, and for every y, if y is a person, then x is wealthier than y.

Wait, but does 'everyone' include the CEO himself? Because if x is a CEO and also a person, then y would include x as well. So, the statement would mean that this CEO is wealthier than themselves, which doesn't make sense. But in logic, I think we can proceed as per the structure, and maybe the problem assumes that CEOs are people, so perhaps it's okay.

So, putting it together: ∃x (Cx ∧ ∀y (Py → Wxy)). Let's see if any of the options match this structure.

Looking at the options:

Option C: (∃x)[Cx • (∀y)(Py ⊃ Wxy)] — That looks exactly like what I have. So that's a possible answer.

Wait, let me check the other options to make sure.

Option A: (∀x)[Px • (∃y)(Cy • Wxy)] — This says for every person x, there's a CEO y who is wealthier than x. That's different because it's saying each person has some CEO wealthier than them, which isn't the same as one CEO being wealthier than all.

Option B: (∃x)[Px • (∀y)(Cy • Wxy)] — This says there's a person x, and for every CEO y, x is wealthier than y. That doesn't fit because it's about a person being wealthier than all CEOs, not a CEO being wealthier than all people.

Option C: As before, matches our structure.

Option D: (∀x)[Cx • (∃y)(Py ⊃ Wxy)] — This would mean every CEO has someone who, if they're a person, the CEO is wealthier than them. That seems off because it's not a universal statement about all people, but rather for each CEO, some person.

Option E: (∃x)[Px ⊃ (∀y)(Cy ⊃ Wxy)] — This seems to say there exists an x such that if x is a person, then for every CEO y, x is wealthier than y. That's not right because it's about a person being wealthier than all CEOs.

Option F: (∃x)[Cx ⊃ (∀y)(Py • Wxy)] — This would be "There exists an x, if x is a CEO, then for every y, y is a person and x is wealthier than y." But the structure is a bit off because it's using a conjunction instead of an implication. Wait, but in our case, we have ∀y (Py → Wxy), which is different from ∀y (Py ∧ Wxy). So F is incorrect.

Option G: (∃x)[Cx ⊃ (∀y)(Py ⊃ Wxy)] — This is similar to option C, but with the implication reversed. Wait, no, in G it's Cx implies the universal statement. So this would mean "There exists an x such that if x is a CEO, then for every person y, x is wealthier than y." But we want to assert that x is a CEO and x is wealthier than everyone. So G is not the same as C because in G, the Cx is in the antecedent of the implication, not conjoined.

Option H: (∀x)[Cx ⊃ (∃y)(Py ⊃ Wxy)] — This says for every CEO x, there exists a y such that if y is a person, then x is wealthier than y. That's not the same as x being wealthier than all people.

Option I: (∀x)[Px ⊃ (∃y)(Cy ⊃ Wxy)] — For every person x, there exists a CEO y such that if y is a CEO, then y is wealthier than x. Not the same as our statement.

Option J: (∃x)[Cx • (∀y)(Py • Wxy)] — This would mean there's a CEO x and for every person y, y is a person and x is wealthier than y. Wait, but the inner part is Py ∧ Wxy, which is different from Py → Wxy. Because in logic, when you have ∀y (Py → Wxy), it's equivalent to ∀y (¬Py ∨ Wxy). But J has ∀y (Py ∧ Wxy), which would require that every y is a person and x is wealthier than them. But that's not correct because y could be something else, like a non-person. So J is wrong.

So the correct option is C: (∃x)[Cx • (∀y)(Py ⊃ Wxy)]

The question requires translating the statement "Some CEO is wealthier than everyone" into predicate logic using the given symbols: 

- \( Cx \): x is a CEO  
- \( Px \): x is a person  
- \( Wxy \): x is wealthier than y  

The correct translation involves asserting the existence of a CEO who is wealthier than every person. This can be expressed as:  

\[
(\exists x)(Cx \land (\forall y)(Py \to Wxy))  
\]

This formula states that there exists an \( x \) such that \( x \) is a CEO (\( Cx \)) and for every \( y \), if \( y \) is a person (\( Py \)), then \( x \) is wealthier than \( y \) (\( Wxy \)).  

Analyzing the options:  

- **Option A**: Incorrect. It states that for every person, there exists a CEO wealthier than them, which is different from one CEO being wealthier than all.  
- **Option B**: Incorrect. It claims there is a person wealthier than all CEOs, which is the opposite of the intended meaning.  
- **Option C**: Correct. It matches the structure \( (\exists x)(Cx \land (\forall y)(Py \to Wxy)) \).  
- **Option D**: Incorrect. It suggests that for every CEO, there exists someone they are wealthier than, which is not the same as one CEO being wealthier than all.  
- **Option E**: Incorrect. It implies a person is wealthier than all CEOs, which is not the statement.  
- **Option F**: Incorrect. It uses a conjunction (\( \land \)) instead of an implication (\( \to \)) for the universal quantifier, which is not the correct structure.  
- **Option G**: Incorrect. It places \( Cx \) in the antecedent of an implication, which does not assert that \( x \) is a CEO.  
- **Option H**: Incorrect. It states that for every CEO, there exists someone they are wealthier than, which is not the same as one CEO being wealthier than all.  
- **Option I**: Incorrect. It suggests that for every person, there exists a CEO wealthier than them, which is not the intended meaning.  
- **Option J**: Incorrect. It uses a conjunction (\( \land \)) instead of an implication (\( \to \)) for the universal quantifier, which is not the correct structure.  

Thus, the correct answer is:  

**C: \( (\exists x)(Cx \land (\forall y)(Py \to Wxy)) \)**
