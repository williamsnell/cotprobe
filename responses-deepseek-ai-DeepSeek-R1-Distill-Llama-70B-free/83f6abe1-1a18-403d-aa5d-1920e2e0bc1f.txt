Question:

Rainmaking Lawfirm regularly purchased its office supplies from catalogs. Marty Manager saw an advertising catalog from Costco offering 10,000 envelopes for $1,000 CIF. He immediately sent a purchase order which stated "our law firm accepts your $1,000 offer for 10,000 envelopes for $1,000 CIF."¬ù Costco then sent Rainmaking an order confirmation which stated "Envelope order acceptance conditional upon a loading charge of $50 per thousand envelopes." If the parties disagree on the proper contract relationship, a court would likely rule:

Options:

A: A contract at $1,000 because the offer terms CIF means cost, insurance and freight including all loading charges.
B: A contract at $1,500 because the loading charges are to be included.
C: No contract because the order confirmation was a counteroffer which was not accepted.
D: No contract because the purchase order was the offer and, under the mirror image rule, can not be deviated from.

Okay, so I've got this contract law question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's start by breaking down the scenario step by step. 

First, the setup: Rainmaking Lawfirm buys office supplies from catalogs. Marty Manager, who's in charge, sees an ad from Costco offering 10,000 envelopes for $1,000 CIF. Marty sends a purchase order accepting the offer as stated. Then Costco sends back an order confirmation adding a $50 per thousand loading charge, making the total $1,500. Now, the question is about whether a contract exists and under what terms.

The options are A through D. I remember that in contract law, the mirror image rule is important. The mirror image rule says that the acceptance must mirror the offer exactly; any deviation makes it a counteroffer instead of an acceptance. So if the original offer (from Costco) was $1,000 CIF, and Rainmaking accepted that, but then Costco added a condition, that might change things.

Wait, but let me think about what "CIF" means. CIF stands for Cost, Insurance, and Freight. So that typically includes all costs up to delivery, including loading charges. So if the original offer was CIF $1,000, then adding a loading charge might be an extra term not covered by the original offer.

So Marty's purchase order was an acceptance of the offer. But then Costco's confirmation added a loading charge. Under the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code), which applies to the sale of goods, there's something about confirmations and additional terms. Normally, in UCC 2-207, additional terms become part of the contract unless they're material and the offeror objects. But wait, here the situation might be a bit different.

Wait, but the initial offer was from Costco, right? No, wait: Marty saw the catalog, which is an offer (usually, catalogs are invitations to treat, but sometimes they can be offers). But in this case, Marty sent a purchase order, which would be an acceptance if the catalog was an offer. Alternatively, the catalog is an invitation to offer, and the purchase order is the offer, which Costco then accepted with a confirmation.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify: generally, a catalog is an invitation to treat, so when Marty sends a purchase order, that's the offer. Then Costco's confirmation is their acceptance. But in this case, the confirmation added a new term. So under UCC 2-207, when a buyer sends an offer and the seller's acceptance includes additional terms, those terms are considered unless they're material and the buyer objects.

Wait, but the question is about whether a contract exists. So if the additional term is a loading charge, which is $50 per thousand, making the total $1,500 instead of $1,000. That's a significant change. So the question is, does this additional term make the confirmation a counteroffer instead of an acceptance?

Under the common law mirror image rule, any deviation in the acceptance makes it a counteroffer. But under UCC 2-207, which applies to goods, additional terms are generally accepted unless they are material. But wait, 2-207 says that if the parties are both merchants, the additional terms become part of the contract unless they are objected to. But if the additional terms are material, like a price change, then it's a counteroffer.

Wait, in this case, the original offer from Costco was $1,000 CIF. So the CIF includes loading charges. So when Costco adds a loading charge, that's actually an extra $500. So that's changing the price, which is a material term. Therefore, the confirmation by Costco would be a counteroffer, not an acceptance. So Marty's purchase order was an offer, and Costco's response was a counteroffer. Since Marty didn't accept that, there's no contract.

Alternatively, if the purchase order was an acceptance of Costco's offer, then adding a condition would be a counteroffer. But if the original offer was in the catalog, which is an invitation to treat, then Marty's purchase order is the offer. So Costco's response is an acceptance with an additional term.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think through this again.

Scenario:
1. Costco's catalog says 10,000 envelopes for $1,000 CIF. Generally, a catalog is an invitation to treat, not an offer. So when Marty sends a purchase order, that's the offer.

2. Marty sends a purchase order accepting the terms, but since the catalog was an invitation, the purchase order is the offer. So Costco's response is an acceptance.

3. Costco's acceptance adds a loading charge, which is $50 per thousand (so $500 total), making the total $1,500.

Under UCC 2-207, when a buyer (Rainmaking) sends an offer, and the seller (Costco) accepts with additional terms, those terms are part of the contract unless they are material and the buyer objects. But in this case, adding $500 is a material change to the price. So, under 2-207, the additional terms would not automatically become part of the contract. But wait, 2-207(2) says that the additional terms are treated as proposals for addition, and between merchants, they become part of the contract unless they are objectionable.

Wait, but the original offer (from Rainmaking) was for $1,000. So when Costco says they accept but with an extra $500, that's a material change. So under 2-207, this would not be considered an acceptance but a counteroffer. Because the additional terms here are proposing a higher price, which is a material term.

So, if the additional terms are material, like changing the price, then the response is a counteroffer, not an acceptance. Therefore, there's no contract yet because the parties haven't agreed on the same terms.

Alternatively, if the original offer (from Costco's catalog) was an offer, then Marty's purchase order would be the acceptance. But in that case, the offer was $1,000 CIF, which includes loading charges. So when Costco sends a confirmation adding a loading charge, that's a new term which wasn't in the offer. So the issue is whether that term is part of the contract.

If the original offer was from Costco at $1,000 CIF, and Marty accepted, then Costco's confirmation adding a loading charge is trying to modify the contract. But under UCC 2-209, a contract can be modified with mutual agreement, but if it's a unilateral attempt, it's not valid unless the other party agrees.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up who made the offer and who accepted. Let me clarify:

If the catalog is an offer, which is rare, then Marty's purchase order would be the acceptance. But usually, a catalog is an invitation to treat, so Marty's purchase order is the offer. So the original offer would be from Marty's firm, and Costco's response is an acceptance with additional terms.

So, under UCC 2-207, when the buyer (Rainmaking) sends an offer, and the seller (Costco) responds with an acceptance plus additional terms, those terms become part of the contract unless:

1. The terms are material (like price, quantity, etc.), and 
2. The buyer (Rainmaking) is a merchant and objects to the terms.

In this case, the additional term is a price increase. So it's a material term. Therefore, the additional term (loading charge) would not automatically become part of the contract. So the contract would be based on the original offer, which was $1,000, unless the buyer agreed to the new terms.

But wait, in this scenario, Rainmaking hasn't agreed to the new terms. So the contract would not include the loading charge. But then, does that mean there's a contract at $1,000?

Alternatively, because the additional term is a material change, Costco's response is a counteroffer. So, Rainmaking would have to accept that counteroffer for a contract to be formed at $1,500. Since they didn't, there's no contract.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to outline it:

1. Catalog (Costco) -> Invitation to treat.
2. Purchase Order (Rainmaking) -> Offer to buy at $1,000.
3. Order Confirmation (Costco) -> Acceptance with additional term (loading charge, total $1,500).

Under UCC 2-207, when a buyer sends an offer, and the seller responds with an acceptance plus additional terms, those terms are considered a proposal. If the additional terms are material, like a price increase, then the response is treated as a counteroffer, not an acceptance. Therefore, there's no contract yet because the buyer hasn't accepted the counteroffer.

So, in this scenario, since the additional term is a material change (price increase), the court would likely find that there's no contract because the order confirmation was a counteroffer that wasn't accepted.

Looking at the options:

A: Contract at $1,000 because CIF includes loading. But wait, if the original offer was $1,000 CIF, and the acceptance adds a loading charge, that's a problem. But in this case, since the purchase order was the offer (from Rainmaking), and the confirmation tried to add a term, it's a counteroffer.

So, option C says no contract because the order confirmation was a counteroffer not accepted. That fits.

Option D says no contract because the purchase order was the offer and mirror image rule applies. But mirror image is more common law, and UCC 2-207 relaxes that. But in this case, the additional term was material, so it's a counteroffer regardless.

So the correct answer should be C: No contract because the order confirmation was a counteroffer which was not accepted.
</think>

To determine whether a contract exists and under what terms, we analyze the sequence of events and apply principles of contract law, particularly the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) 2-207, which governs the sale of goods.

1. **Initial Offer**: Costco's catalog offering 10,000 envelopes for $1,000 CIF (Cost, Insurance, and Freight) is typically considered an invitation to treat, not a binding offer. However, Marty's purchase order, which "accepts" the $1,000 offer, constitutes an offer under the UCC.

2. **Response from Costco**: Costco's order confirmation adds a loading charge of $50 per thousand envelopes, increasing the total price to $1,500. Under UCC 2-207, when a seller responds to a buyer's offer with an acceptance that includes additional terms, those terms are treated as proposals for addition to the contract. However, if the additional terms are material (e.g., a price increase), the response is considered a counteroffer rather than an acceptance.

3. **Materiality of the Additional Term**: The loading charge constitutes a material change to the original offer because it increases the total price. Under UCC 2-207, such a material change means Costco's response is a counteroffer, not an acceptance. Since Rainmaking Lawfirm did not accept this counteroffer, no contract has been formed.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. While "CIF" typically includes loading charges, the issue here is not whether CIF covers loading charges but whether Costco's additional term constitutes a counteroffer, which it does.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. There is no contract at $1,500 because Rainmaking did not accept the counteroffer.
   - **Option C**: Correct. The order confirmation was a counteroffer that was not accepted, so no contract exists.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. While the mirror image rule applies under common law, UCC 2-207 relaxes this rule for the sale of goods. The key issue is that the additional term was material, making the response a counteroffer.

Thus, the court would likely rule that no contract exists because Costco's order confirmation was a counteroffer that Rainmaking did not accept.
