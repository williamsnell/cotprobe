Okay, so I've got this question about electric circuits and critical frequencies. Hmm, I remember that critical frequency has something to do with the point where the impedance of a circuit changes, maybe in filters? 

The question says the lowest critical frequency is due to zero and it's present at the origin or near it. Wait, zero what? Oh, right, I think it's about poles and zeros in the transfer function of a circuit. Poles are where the function goes to infinity, like resonance points, and zeros are where it goes to zero, so no output there.

So the question is about a network type where the lowest critical frequency is a zero near the origin. I'm trying to recall which type of circuit has a zero at the origin. Oh, right! In RC circuits. Because in an RC circuit, the transfer function has a zero at the origin. Like, for a simple high-pass RC circuit, the transfer function is (jωRC)/(1 + jωRC). So when ω is zero, the numerator is zero, making the whole function zero. That means at DC (zero frequency), the output is zero, so the low frequencies are attenuated. So the zero is at the origin.

Wait, but the question is about the lowest critical frequency being due to a zero. So that zero is the first critical frequency point. Which network would that be? So the options are various combinations of R, L, C.

Looking at the options, option B is RC circuit. Option I is LC circuit. Wait, an LC circuit has both a zero and a pole, but I'm not sure. No, wait, an LC circuit's transfer function has a pole at resonance, but maybe zeros elsewhere? Or maybe in certain configurations.

Wait, no. Let me think again. In an RL circuit, the transfer function is like (R)/(R + jωL), which has a pole at infinity, I think. Or maybe at zero? Wait, no. Wait, for an RL circuit, the impedance is R + jωL. The transfer function for voltage across R is (R)/(R + jωL). At ω approaching infinity, the R becomes negligible, so the function approaches 1. At ω zero, it's R/(R) = 1. So no zero at the origin.

In an RC circuit, the transfer function for the capacitor voltage is (jωRC)/(1 + jωRC), which as I said, is zero at ω=0. So that's a zero at the origin.

But wait, the question says the lowest critical frequency is due to a zero. So the first critical frequency is a zero, implying it's a high-pass characteristic because the zero is at low frequencies. So the network must have a zero at the origin.

So which option is that? The options are A: RL, B: RC, C: CL (I don't think CL is a standard term, maybe a typo for LC?), D: CR (maybe same as RC?), E: RCL, etc.

Wait, option B is RC circuit. So in an RC circuit, the zero is at the origin, which would be the lowest critical frequency. So that would make the type of network an RC circuit.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. What about LC circuits? An LC circuit has a resonant frequency where the impedance is zero (for series) or infinite (for parallel), but does it have a zero in the transfer function at the origin? No, I think LC circuits have their poles at the resonant frequency, but the zeros would be elsewhere. For example, a series LC circuit's voltage across the capacitor would have a zero at DC because at ω=0, the capacitor is open, so no voltage. So maybe the zero is at the origin as well. Wait, but that's more about the specific configuration.

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the concepts. Let's think about the general case. The presence of a zero at the origin in the transfer function implies that at DC, the output is zero. So in an RC circuit, like a high-pass filter, the output is zero at DC and starts to rise as frequency increases. So the first critical frequency is at zero, which is a zero.

So the correct answer would be an RC circuit, which is option B.

The question asks about the type of network where the lowest critical frequency is due to a zero, which may be present at the origin or near it. This implies the network has a zero at the origin in its transfer function, corresponding to a high-pass characteristic where the output is zero at DC (zero frequency) and increases as frequency rises.

In an RC circuit, the transfer function for the voltage across the capacitor is given by:

\[
\frac{V_C}{V_S} = \frac{j\omega RC}{1 + j\omega RC}
\]

At \(\omega = 0\), the numerator becomes zero, making the entire function zero. This indicates a zero at the origin, which is the lowest critical frequency. The RC circuit exhibits this behavior, making it the correct choice.

Other options, such as RL or LC circuits, do not have a zero at the origin. For example, in an RL circuit, the transfer function does not have a zero at \(\omega = 0\), and LC circuits typically have poles at their resonant frequencies rather than a zero at the origin.

Thus, the network type that satisfies the condition is the RC circuit.
