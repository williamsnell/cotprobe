Question:

A: 3 bounces
B: 8 bounces
C: 6 bounces
D: 7 bounces
E: 10 bounces
F: 4 bounces

Okay, let's try to solve this problem. So, a boy drops a rubber ball from 4 feet, and each bounce the ball loses 10% of its energy. We need to find out after how many bounces the ball will only rise to 2 feet.

Hmm, so the ball is dropped from 4 feet. When it bounces, it doesn't reach the same height because it loses energy. Each time it loses 10% of its energy due to friction or compression. Wait, but how does energy loss translate to height loss? I think energy is related to the height because the potential energy at a certain height determines how high it bounces back.

So, the initial potential energy is proportional to the height, right? So when the ball drops, it converts potential energy to kinetic, and when it bounces back, some energy is lost. Since it loses 10% each bounce, that means after each bounce, it retains 90% of its previous height?

Wait, no. Because energy and height aren't directly proportional in a linear way. Oh wait, wait. Potential energy is proportional to height, but kinetic energy depends on velocity squared. But in the case of a bounce, assuming it's an elastic collision (but with some loss), the height after each bounce would be determined by the energy retained.

So, if the ball loses 10% of its energy on each bounce, that means it retains 90% of its energy each time. Since energy is proportional to height (because PE = mgh, so E proportional to h), each bounce the height should be 90% of the previous height. So the height after each bounce is multiplied by 0.9.

Wait, but wait—does that mean the height is 90% each time? Let me think. If it loses 10% energy, then the remaining energy is 90% of previous. So yes, the height would be 0.9 times the previous height each bounce.

So the initial height is 4 feet. After the first bounce, it reaches 4 * 0.9 = 3.6 feet. Second bounce: 3.6 * 0.9 = 3.24 feet. Third: 3.24 *0.9 ≈2.916 feet. Fourth: 2.916 *0.9 ≈2.6244. So after four bounces, it's about 2.624 feet, which is above 2. So it hasn't reached 2 feet yet. The fifth bounce would be 2.6244 *0.9 ≈2.362, which is still above 2. Sixth: 2.362 *0.9 ≈2.1258. Seventh: 2.1258 *0.9 ≈1.913. Oh wait, that's below 2 feet. So the seventh bounce is when it rises to about 1.913 feet, which is less than 2. 

Wait, but the question is how many bounces until it only rises to 2 feet. So the first time it's below 2 is after the seventh bounce. So the answer would be seven bounces.

Wait, let me count again step by step. The initial drop is from 4 feet. Then each bounce height is:

1st bounce: 4*0.9 = 3.6 → above 2.

2nd: 3.6*0.9=3.24 → yes.

3rd: 3.24*.9=2.916 → yes.

4th: 2.916*.9≈2.624 → yes.

5th: 2.624*.9≈2.362 → yes.

6th: 2.362*.9≈2.1258 → yes.

7th: 2.1258*.9≈1.913 → no, below 2.

So it's after the 7th bounce that it doesn't reach 2 feet. So the number of bounces needed is 7.

Looking at the options, option D is 7, so the answer should be D.

To determine how many bounces it will take for the ball to rise only 2 feet, we analyze the energy loss and its effect on the height after each bounce. The ball loses 10% of its energy on each bounce, meaning it retains 90% of its energy (and thus 90% of its height) after each bounce. The height after each bounce can be calculated as:

- **Initial height**: 4 feet  
- **1st bounce**: \( 4 \times 0.9 = 3.6 \, \text{feet} \)  
- **2nd bounce**: \( 3.6 \times 0.9 = 3.24 \, \text{feet} \)  
- **3rd bounce**: \( 3.24 \times 0.9 \approx 2.916 \, \text{feet} \)  
- **4th bounce**: \( 2.916 \times 0.9 \approx 2.624 \, \text{feet} \)  
- **5th bounce**: \( 2.624 \times 0.9 \approx 2.362 \, \text{feet} \)  
- **6th bounce**: \( 2.362 \times 0.9 \approx 2.1258 \, \text{feet} \)  
- **7th bounce**: \( 2.1258 \times 0.9 \approx 1.913 \, \text{feet} \)  

After the 7th bounce, the ball rises to approximately 1.913 feet, which is below 2 feet. Therefore, it takes 7 bounces for the ball to rise only 2 feet above the ground.

The correct answer is **D: 7 bounces**.
