Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a car rounding a curve, and I need to find the centripetal force. Hmm, centripetal force... I remember that's the force needed to keep an object moving in a circular path. The formula for centripetal force is F = (m*v²)/r, right? But wait, I should make sure I remember it correctly.

The problem states the car's weight is 3200 pounds, and it's moving at 60 miles per hour. The radius of the curve is 484 feet. Wait, but pounds is a unit of force, not mass. Oh right, because in the English system, weight is mass times gravity. So I need to convert that weight into mass. Because the formula requires mass, not weight.

So, weight (W) equals mass (m) times gravity (g). So m = W/g. What's the value of g in ft/s²? I think it's 32 ft/s². So m = 3200 lb / 32 ft/s². Let me calculate that. 3200 divided by 32... 32 times 100 is 3200, so 100. So the mass is 100 slugs. Because slug is the unit of mass in the English system. Okay, that makes sense.

Next, the velocity is given in miles per hour. I need to convert that into feet per second because the radius is in feet and the standard unit for these calculations would be in feet and seconds. How do I convert 60 mph to ft/s? 

I remember that 1 mile is 5280 feet, and 1 hour is 3600 seconds. So 60 miles per hour is 60 * 5280 feet per 3600 seconds. Let me compute that. 60 divided by 3600 is 1/60. So 5280 * (1/60) = 5280/60. Let's see, 5280 divided by 60: 60*88 is 5280, right? So 5280/60 is 88. So the speed is 88 feet per second. Got it.

Now, plugging everything into the centripetal force formula: F = (m*v²)/r. So m is 100 slugs, v is 88 ft/s, and r is 484 ft.

Let me calculate v squared first. 88 squared is... 80 squared is 6400, 8 squared is 64, and then cross terms 2*80*8=1280. So 6400 + 1280 +64 = 7744. So v² is 7744.

Then, m*v² is 100 * 7744 = 774,400.

Now, divide that by the radius, which is 484 ft. So 774400 / 484. Let me do that division. Hmm, 484 times 1600 is 774,400 because 484 * 1000 is 484,000, and 484 * 600 is 290,400. Wait, 484 * 1600 = 484 * (1000 + 600) = 484,000 + 290,400 = 774,400. Oh, so 774400 /484 is 1600. So F is 1600 pounds? Wait, no, wait, because the units. The formula gives force in pounds since we started with pounds for weight after converting. Wait, centripetal force is in the same units as the weight here, so pounds.

Wait a second, let me double-check the steps. Because sometimes when converting units, things can go wrong. So, mass is 3200 lb / 32 ft/s² = 100 slugs. Velocity is 88 ft/s. Radius is 484 ft. So F = (100 * 88²) / 484.

88 squared is 7744, correct. 100 * 7744 is 774400. 774400 divided by 484: Let me do that division again. 484 * 1000 is 484000. 774400 -484000 = 290400. 484 *600 is 290400. So 1000 + 600 =1600. So yes, 1600. So the centripetal force is 1600 pounds. Looking back at the options, option J is 1600 lb. So the answer should be J.

To determine the centripetal force acting on the car as it rounds the curve, we use the formula for centripetal force:

\[
F = \frac{m v^2}{r}
\]

### Step 1: Convert weight to mass
The car's weight is given as 3200 lb. In the English system, weight \( W \) is related to mass \( m \) by the formula:

\[
W = m g
\]

where \( g = 32 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \). Solving for \( m \):

\[
m = \frac{W}{g} = \frac{3200}{32} = 100 \, \text{slugs}
\]

### Step 2: Convert velocity to feet per second
The car's speed is given as 60 mph. To convert this to feet per second:

\[
1 \, \text{mile} = 5280 \, \text{feet}, \quad 1 \, \text{hour} = 3600 \, \text{seconds}
\]

\[
v = 60 \, \text{mph} \times \frac{5280 \, \text{ft}}{3600 \, \text{s}} = 88 \, \text{ft/s}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate centripetal force
Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
F = \frac{m v^2}{r}
\]

\[
m = 100 \, \text{slugs}, \quad v = 88 \, \text{ft/s}, \quad r = 484 \, \text{ft}
\]

First, calculate \( v^2 \):

\[
v^2 = 88^2 = 7744 \, \text{ft}^2/\text{s}^2
\]

Then, calculate \( m v^2 \):

\[
m v^2 = 100 \times 7744 = 774400 \, \text{slug-ft}^2/\text{s}^2
\]

Finally, divide by \( r \):

\[
F = \frac{774400}{484} = 1600 \, \text{lb}
\]

### Final Answer:
The centripetal force required is **1600 lb**, which corresponds to option **J**.
