Okay, so I've got this question here about atoms, and I'm supposed to figure out which statement is not true. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question is asking which statement about an atom is not true. The options are A to F. Let me go through each option one by one and think about what I know.

Starting with option A: "A neutral atom always has equal numbers of electrons and protons." Hmm. I remember that in a neutral atom, the number of electrons equals the number of protons. Because protons are positive and electrons are negative, so they balance each other out, making the atom neutral. So A sounds correct. So A is true, so not the answer.

Option B: "The electrons can only orbit at particular energy levels." I think this is about the quantum model of the atom. Electrons don't orbit the nucleus in any random path but are found in specific energy levels or shells. So yes, B is a true statement. So B is correct, not the answer.

Option C: "Electrons and protons in a neutral atom are always equal in number." Wait, this sounds similar to option A. Oh right, because if it's neutral, electrons equal protons. So C is saying the same thing as A, so C is also true. So C isn't the answer either.

Option D: "Electrons can orbit at any energy level." Wait, that seems off. I thought electrons can't just be at any energy level. They have specific quantized levels. So D is saying the opposite of B, which was correct. So D must be false. So D is a possible candidate for the incorrect statement.

Option E: "A neutral atom always has equal numbers of neutrons and protons." Hmm. Wait, no. The number of neutrons doesn't have to equal the number of protons in a neutral atom. For example, carbon-12 has 6 protons, 6 neutrons, but carbon-14 has 6 protons and 8 neutrons. Both are neutral but have different neutron numbers. So E is not true. So E is a false statement.

Option F: "The nucleus contains most of the atom’s mass but almost none of its volume." Yeah, the nucleus is tiny compared to the atom. Most of the mass comes from protons and neutrons, which are in the nucleus. But the nucleus takes up almost no space compared to the electron cloud. So F is correct.

Wait, but I need to find the statement that is not true. So looking back, the false statements are D and E. Let me double-check the options.

The question is asking which statement is NOT true, so I need to pick the false one.

So, D says electrons can orbit at any energy level. That's incorrect because they're restricted to specific levels. So D is false. E says a neutral atom always has equal neutrons and protons. That's also incorrect because, for example, in chlorine-35, there are 17 protons, 18 neutrons, and it's neutral. So E is also false.

Wait, but looking at the options, the question is which statement is not true. So if both D and E are false, but the options only have one correct answer, I must have made a mistake.

Wait no, the options are A-F. Let me go through each:

A: True, because neutral means equal protons and electrons.

B: True, energy levels are quantized.

C: True, same as A but wording is about electrons and protons.

D: False, electrons can't orbit any level.

E: False, because neutrally charged atoms don't have to have same number of neutrons as protons.

F: True, nucleus has most mass, little volume.

So the statements that are not true are D and E. But the question is, which statement is not true. So the options would have both D and E as possible answers, but the question expects one choice.

Wait, perhaps I should read the options again.

Looking back, the question is: "Which statement about an atom is not true." So I need to find the false one. So which options are false.

So D and E are both false. But looking at the options, the choices are options A to F, each as separate options.

Wait, but let me look at the options again:

The answer options are A to F.

The question is to choose which statement is not true, so the incorrect statement is either D or E.

Wait, perhaps I should read each option carefully.

Option E says: "A neutral atom always has equal numbers of neutrons and protons." No, that's incorrect. The number of neutrons can vary (isotopes), but as long as protons=electrons, the atom is neutral. So E is false.

So the false statements are D and E.

But the options are from A to F, and the question is which one is not true. So perhaps both D and E are not true, but looking at the options, only one can be the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the question is about which is not true. So among the options, which is not a true statement.

Wait, the options are each separate statements, so the question is which one is false.

So the question is, which statement is FALSE.

So the false statements are D and E.

But the answer choices are options A to F, each is a statement.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Let me think again.

Which options are false.

Option D: Electrons can orbit at any energy level. This is not true because they can only be at specific levels. So D is false.

Option E: A neutral atom always has equal numbers of neutrons and protons. That's not true because the number of neutrons can be different, as in isotopes. So E is false.

So both D and E are false statements. But the question is asking which statement is not true, so the correct answer should be either D or E.

Wait, but the options are multiple-choice, and only one option is correct. So perhaps only one of them is in the provided options as the correct answer.

Wait, looking at the options again, the options are:

A: Neutral atom has equal electrons and protons. True.

B: Electrons orbit at particular energy levels. True.

C: Electrons and protons equal in number in neutral. True.

D: Electrons can orbit any energy level. False.

E: Neutral atom has equal neutrons and protons. False.

F: Nucleus has most mass, little volume. True.

So both D and E are false. But the question is which statement is not true; perhaps the question is giving only one option as the correct answer. Wait, perhaps in the options given, the answer is E.

Wait, looking back at the question, the options are:

The options are:

A: A neutral atom always has equal numbers of electrons and protons.

B: The electrons can only orbit at particular energy levels.

C: Electrons and protons in a neutral atom are always equal in number.

D: Electrons can orbit at any energy level.

E: A neutral atom always has equal numbers of neutrons and protons.

F: The nucleus contains most of the atom’s mass but almost none of its volume.

So the question is to choose which statement is NOT true. So the false statements are D and E.

But the choices are A-F, so only one is correct. Maybe the question only lists one of them as an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is looking for any one of the false statements. So the correct answer would be either D or E.

But looking back, perhaps the correct answer is E because the question is about the number of neutrons and protons in a neutral atom.

Wait, but E is definitely false. So among the options, the statements that are not true are both D and E. But the possible answers are A to F, so I must choose which one is the correct choice.

Wait, the actual question is which is not true. So either D or E is the correct answer.

Wait, looking at the options, the question is which is not true. So perhaps the intended answer is E.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is designed so that only one option is false.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is phrased as "which statement about an atom is not true." So I need to find the false statement.

So, considering each option:

A is true because neutral atoms have equal protons and electrons.

B is true because electrons are in specific energy levels.

C is same as A, so true.

D is false because electrons can't be at any energy level.

E is false because neutral atoms don't need equal neutrons and protons.

F is true.

So the options have two false statements, D and E. But the question expects one answer. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting some point.

Wait, re-reading the options.

Option D: Electrons can orbit at any energy level. No, that's incorrect because of quantum mechanics; they're restricted to specific levels. So D is false.

Option E: A neutral atom always has equal numbers of neutrons and protons. No, that's not correct. The number of neutrons can vary; for example, isotopes have the same number of protons but different neutrons, but the atom remains neutral as electrons equal protons. So E is false.

So both D and E are incorrect. But in the provided options, perhaps only one is among the choices, but in our case, both are options.

Wait, but the question is given as options A to F, each being a statement, and only one is the correct answer. So perhaps the intended answer is E. Or D.

Wait, perhaps the question is in the context of the early models. Let me think again.

Electrons can orbit only at specific energy levels (B is true, D is false), and neutral atoms don't have to have equal numbers of neutrons and protons (so E is false).

So the false statements are D and E.

But the question is asking which statement is not true, so I must choose between D and E.

Wait, looking at the actual question, perhaps the correct answer is E. Because the other options are about energy levels, which I know are correct.

Wait, but the question is in the options, and the correct answer is either D or E.

Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is E.

Wait, perhaps the question is designed so that E is the correct answer, but I might have to pick which one isn't true.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. I think I should remember that electrons are restricted to certain energy levels, so D is false. And E is false because neutral atoms can have varying neutrons.

So the statements that are not true are D and E. But the question only allows selecting one option, so perhaps the correct answer is E.

Wait, but the question is which statement is not true. So perhaps the correct answer is E because it's about neutrons and protons, which isn't necessarily equal in a neutral atom.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects D to be the correct answer because it's talking about energy levels.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct answer from the options given. Since both D and E are incorrect, but the question expects one answer, perhaps the intended answer is E.

Wait, but the way the options are presented, perhaps E is the correct answer. Because statement E is not necessarily true, while D is definitely false.

Wait, no, both D and E are false. But perhaps the intended answer is E.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of each option.

So the question is which is not true. So the false statements are D and E.

But looking back, perhaps the correct answer is E.

Wait, perhaps I should go with E as the answer. Because some people might think that in a neutral atom, the number of neutrons equals protons, but that's not the case.

So the correct answer is E, and the statement that's not true is E.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D because it's about energy levels. So I'm a bit confused.

Wait, if I had to choose between the two, I think the intended answer is E. Because the question is about the composition of the atom, while D is about energy levels, which is a different concept.

Wait, but in reality, both D and E are false. But the question must have only one correct answer, so perhaps I should look for which is the more obviously incorrect statement.

Hmm, perhaps the answer is E because it's a common misconception that atoms have equal protons and neutrons, but that's not necessarily the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D because it's directly contradicting the quantum model.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is not true. So D is definitely false, as electrons can't orbit at any energy level. They have specific levels. So D is false.

E is also false because a neutral atom doesn't require equal neutrons and protons.

So both D and E are correct answers. But the options only allow for one choice. Therefore, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is a trick. Let me read all options again.

Option E says "A neutral atom always has equal numbers of neutrons and protons." That's incorrect because, as I said, isotopes have varying neutrons but same protons. So E is false.

Option D says "Electrons can orbit at any energy level." That's false because of the quantized energy levels.

So both are false, but the options don't allow for multiple choices. So perhaps the intended answer is E, or perhaps D.

But given that, I think I should go with E as the correct answer because I'm more confident about that one being incorrect.

Wait, but then again, D is also incorrect. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E, which is statement E.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it this way: the question is which is not true.

So the correct answer is either D or E. Looking at the options, perhaps the intended answer is E.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to think of each option.

Option D is definitely false because electrons can't be at any energy level. So D is incorrect.

Option E is also incorrect because neutral atoms don't have equal neutrons and protons.

So both D and E are false. But the question allows only one choice. So perhaps the intended answer is E.

Wait, but the question is which statement is not true. So I'm to pick one. Let me check the options again.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the one that's definitely false, regardless of the others.

Well, I think I'm getting stuck because both D and E are incorrect. But perhaps I should go with E because that's a more basic fact.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, and the intended choice is E.

I think I've thought enough, and I'll settle on E being the correct answer.

To determine which statement about an atom is not true, let us analyze each option:

- **Option A**: "A neutral atom always has equal numbers of electrons and protons."  
  This is true because, in a neutral atom, the number of electrons equals the number of protons to balance the positive and negative charges.

- **Option B**: "The electrons can only orbit at particular energy levels."  
  This is true as electrons occupy specific, quantized energy levels according to quantum mechanics.

- **Option C**: "Electrons and protons in a neutral atom are always equal in number."  
  This is true and is essentially the same as Option A.

- **Option D**: "Electrons can orbit at any energy level."  
  This is false because electrons are restricted to specific, quantized energy levels and cannot occupy any arbitrary energy level.

- **Option E**: "A neutral atom always has equal numbers of neutrons and protons."  
  This is false because the number of neutrons in an atom can vary (isotopes), even though the atom remains neutral as long as the number of electrons equals the number of protons.

- **Option F**: "The nucleus contains most of the atom’s mass but almost none of its volume."  
  This is true because the nucleus is extremely small compared to the atom but contains most of its mass due to the protons and neutrons.

Both **Option D** and **Option E** are false. However, since the question asks for a single statement that is not true, **Option E** is the more appropriate choice because it directly addresses a common misconception about the composition of neutral atoms.
