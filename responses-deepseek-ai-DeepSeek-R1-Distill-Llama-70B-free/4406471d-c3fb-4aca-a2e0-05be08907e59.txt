Okay, so I have this question about Jaina traditions and the term "caityavasis." I'm a bit rusty on my Jainism, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Jainism has a strong ascetic tradition. There are monks and nuns who renounce worldly life and follow strict rules. The terms for different types of ascetics might vary, but I think there are different categories based on where they live or their practices.

The question is asking about caityavasis. The word "caitya" comes to mind. I think in Jainism, caitya refers to a shrine or a temple. So, "caityavasi" would mean someone who lives in a temple or shrine.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Monks who lived in forests. I know that some ascetics live in forests, but I'm not sure if they're called caityavasis. Forest-dwelling monks might be called something else, maybe aranyavasis?

Option B: Jain kings. That doesn't seem right. Kings are laypeople, not ascetics.

Option C: Orthodox interpreters. That sounds more like scholars or priests, not necessarily ascetics living in temples.

Option D: Monks who perform public penance. Public penance might be a practice, but I don't think it's specific to temple-dwellers.

Option E: Women ascetics. There are women ascetics, but again, the term would probably specify gender, and I'm not sure if they're linked to temples specifically.

Option F: Lay followers in cities. Lay people are different from ascetics, so this doesn't fit.

Option G: Temple-dwelling renouncers. This seems to align with "caityavasi" because "caitya" is temple. So, renouncers living in temples would be caityavasis.

Option H: Ascetics in isolation. That's more like hermits or those practicing severe asceticism, maybe the "shatkhandagatas" or something else.

Option I: Household supporters. These are laypeople who support the ascetics, so they're not the ones living in temples.

Option J: Highest asceticism practitioners. This might refer to those who follow the most stringent rules, but not necessarily tied to living in temples.

So putting it together, the term "caityavasi" likely refers to ascetics who live in temples. So the correct answer should be G.

The term "caityavasi" in Jaina traditions refers to temple-dwelling renouncers, as "caitya" signifies a temple or shrine. Among the options, the most accurate description is:

G: Temple-dwelling renouncers.

Answer: G
