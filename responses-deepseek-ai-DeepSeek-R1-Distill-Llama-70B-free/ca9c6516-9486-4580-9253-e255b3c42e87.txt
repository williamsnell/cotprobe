Okay, so I've got this problem about a transformer connected as an autotransformer, and I need to find the voltage regulation and efficiency. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on transformers, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, let's understand the problem. The transformer is a two-winding type, rated 2.2 kVA, 220/110 volts, 60 Hz. Winding A is the 220V side with impedance 0.24 + j0.40 ohms, and Winding B is 110V with impedance 0.05 + j0.09 ohms. Core loss is 28 watts at rated voltage and frequency. Now, it's connected as an autotransformer to supply a load at 220V from a 330V source. The load current is 30A at 0.9 power factor lagging. We need to find the voltage regulation and efficiency.

Alright, let's break this down. Autotransformers have a single winding with a tap, so part of the winding is used. The connections are different from a standard step-up or step-down transformer. Since the transformer is now used as an autotransformer, the configuration changes how the voltages and currents are related.

I remember that in an autotransformer, the voltage is applied across a portion of the winding. The primary (source) is connected across a part of the winding, and the secondary (load) is across another part. The ratio of the source and load voltages determines the tap points.

Wait, the source is 330V, and the load is 220V. So the autotransformer is stepping down 330V to 220V. That means the source is connected to a part of the winding, and the load is connected across the entire winding or a different part. Let me think about how the turns ratio works here.

In a normal transformer, the turns ratio a = N1/N2 determines voltage ratio V1/V2 = a. But in an autotransformer, part of the same winding is used, so the ratio is (N1)/(N1 - N2) or something like that. Alternatively, the ratio could be (N_total)/(N_total - N_part).

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the effective turns ratio based on the voltage. The supply voltage is 330V, and the load voltage is 220V. So the ratio is 330/220 = 1.5. So the autotransformer steps down 330V to 220V, meaning the source is connected across the entire winding, and the load is connected across a portion. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think again.

Wait, in an autotransformer, the source is connected between one end of the winding and a tap, and the load is connected between the tap and the other end. So the total number of turns is N. Let's say the source is connected to the full winding (N turns) to get higher voltage, but here the source is 330V, which is higher than the original rating of 220V. Hmm, maybe I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, the original transformer has two windings. When used as an autotransformer, one of the windings (or a part of it) is used. Let me think about the configuration. Since the load is 220V, which is the same as Winding A's original rating. So perhaps in the autotransformer setup, Winding A is being used as the common winding.

Alternatively, maybe Winding A is the one connected to the source, and a tap is taken somewhere along Winding A to provide the lower voltage for the load. Or perhaps the other way around.

Wait, maybe I should model the autotransformer as a single winding with a tap. Let's say the transformer has a total of N turns. The source is connected between the line and the tap, which is at, say, kN turns from one end. The load is connected across the remaining (1−k)N turns. The voltage ratios would then be V_source / V_load = (kN) / ((1−k)N) ) = k/(1−k). So the turns ratio (a) is a = V_source / V_load = 330/220 = 1.5. So a = 1.5 = k/(1−k). Solving for k: 1.5(1−k) =k →1.5 -1.5k =k →1.5=2.5k →k=0.6. So the source is connected across 60% of the winding, and the load across 40%. So the turns ratio a is 1.5, which is source to load.

Wait, but in this case, the transformer is being used in a way that the source is 330V, which is higher than the original 220V of Winding A. So perhaps Winding A is the one being used as the autotransformer winding. Because the original Winding A is 220V, but now the source is 330V. Hmm, but the transformer's original winding A has an impedance, and that might come into play.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the equivalent circuit of the transformer when used as an autotransformer. But I'm getting a bit stuck on the configuration. Let me try to approach this step by step.

First, let's find the equivalent impedance as seen from the source side. Since it's an autotransformer, the impedance will be different than in the standard transformer configuration.

Wait, maybe the first thing to do is to determine the per unit values or to adjust the impedances based on the new voltage levels.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the load current and the source current, considering the turns ratio.

Wait, the load is 30A at 0.9 pf lagging. The load voltage is 220V. So the load power is VL * IL * pf = 220 * 30 * 0.9 = let's see: 220*30=6600, times 0.9 is 5940 W. So the load is 5940 W.

But in an autotransformer, the power is shared between the source and the load via the transformer's windings. Wait, no, actually, in an autotransformer, part of the power comes directly from the source to the load through the windings, and the rest is transformed.

Wait, perhaps the equivalent way is to model the autotransformer as a two-winding transformer with one winding having N1 turns and the other N2 turns, where N1 is the total number of turns, N2 is the tapped part.

Wait, maybe the ratio a is such that a = (N1)/(N2). So for the autotransformer, a = V1/V2 = (330)/(220) = 1.5. So a = 1.5.

Wait, but in a normal transformer, a = V1/V2 = N1/N2. But in an autotransformer, the configuration is such that the source is connected across N1, and the load is connected across (N1 - N2), where N2 is the tapped section. So perhaps the ratio is a = (N1)/(N1 - N2) = 1.5. Hmm, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, considering the autotransformer's voltage ratio, the source voltage is V1 = 330V, and the load voltage is V2 = 220V. So the ratio is V1/V2 = 1.5. The current ratio would be inverse, I2/I1 = 1.5, because in an ideal transformer, power is conserved: V1*I1 = V2*I2 → I2 = (V1/V2)*I1 = 1.5*I1.

Wait, but in an autotransformer, the current in the windings isn't just that. Because part of the current flows directly, and part goes through the transformer. Let me think again.

In an autotransformer, the source current I1 is equal to the difference between the load current I2 and the current in the secondary I2'. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps I should model the problem using the given impedances. The transformer has two windings, each with their own impedance. Now, when connected as an autotransformer, the effective impedance seen from the source would be a combination of these impedances, adjusted by the turns ratio.

But I'm not exactly sure how to approach this. Let's try to model the problem.

First, the transformer's original ratings are 220/110 volts. So Winding A is 220V, Winding B is 110V. So the turns ratio as a normal transformer would be 220/110 = 2:1. So a = 2 when used normally.

But now it's used as an autotransformer, so the configuration changes. The source is 330V, the load is 220V. So the ratio is 330/220 = 3/2 or 1.5:1.

Wait, perhaps the transformer is being used in such a way that the 220V winding is connected as the autotransformer's common winding. So the source is 330V, and the load is 220V, so the ratio is 330/220 = 1.5. So the autotransformer uses part of the 220V winding.

Wait, the original transformer has a 220V winding (A) and a 110V winding (B). When connected as an autotransformer, perhaps the 220V winding is split into two parts. Let me think: the source is connected between the line and a tap on the 220V winding, and the load is connected between the tap and the neutral end. So the source voltage is the voltage across the entire 220V winding, but wait, no, the source is 330V, which is higher than 220V. So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe the source is connected to Winding A (220V) and a tap, and the load is connected across a part of Winding A. But the original Winding A is 220V, and the source is 330V, which would require a higher voltage than the winding's rating. Hmm, maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the transformer is being used with Winding B as the autotransformer's winding. Winding B is rated 110V. So the source is 330V, which is 3 times 110V. So the ratio would be 330/110 = 3. So the autotransformer would consist of the full Winding B plus a tap, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the equivalent circuit. Let me try to model the autotransformer setup.

In an autotransformer, the total voltage is applied across the entire winding, and a portion is tapped. So the voltage per turn is V_total / N_total. Let's say the total number of turns in the autotransformer winding is N. The source is connected across the entire N turns, giving V1 = N * (V_per_turn). Then, the load is connected across k*N turns, so V2 = k*N * (V_per_turn) = k*V1.

Wait, but in our case, V1 is 330V, V2 is 220V. So 220 = k *330 → k = 220/330 = 2/3. So the load is connected across 2/3 of the winding. So the turns ratio a = V1/V2 = 330/220 = 1.5.

So the source current I1 is related to the load current I2 by I1 = I2*(1 - k) / k. Wait, maybe it's better to use the formula for current in autotransformers: I1 = I2*(1 - 1/a), where a is the voltage ratio.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think again. The voltage ratio a is V1/V2 = 330/220 = 1.5.

In an autotransformer, the current ratio is I2/I1 = a/(a-1). Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, in an ideal autotransformer, the current in the windings would be such that I1 (source) is equal to (I2)(a-1)/a, because part of the current flows directly.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in an autotransformer, the source current I1 is equal to the load current I2 multiplied by (a-1)/a. Because the load current is I2 = (a/(a-1)) * I1. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, the current in the common winding is the difference between the source current and the load current. Let me think in terms of the equivalent circuit.

In an autotransformer, the source current I1 flows into the common winding, and the load current I2 flows out from the load side. The current through the transformer windings is the difference between these two: I_winding = I1 - I2.

Wait, perhaps that's correct. Because the source supplies I1, and the load takes I2. The current that flows through the transformer's internal windings is I1 - I2. So the current in the windings would be I1 - I2.

But I'm not entirely confident about this. Let me try to think with numbers. If the voltage ratio a is 1.5, then the current ratio would be I1/I2 = (a - 1)/a or something like that. Maybe I should look for a formula, but since I can't, I'll have to derive it.

In an ideal autotransformer (no losses), the power input equals the power output. So V1*I1 = V2*I2 + (I1 - I2)*V1*(k), where k is the ratio of the tapped voltage to the total voltage. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, since V1 = a*V2, and power in is V1*I1, power out is V2*I2. Since it's ideal, V1*I1 = V2*I2. Also, I1 = I2*(1 - 1/a). Let me plug in a = 1.5.

I1 = I2*(1 - 2/3) = I2*(1/3). So I1 = I2/3.

Given that the load current I2 is 30A, then I1 would be 10A. So the current through the windings would be I1 =10A, and the load current is 30A. So the current in the transformer's windings is 10A, and the source current is 10A, while the load current is 30A.

Wait, that makes sense because the source only needs to supply 10A, and the load gets 30A, with 20A coming directly from the source through the autotransformer's tapped connection.

So, with that, the current through the transformer's windings is 10A. Now, the next step is to find the voltage drop in the windings due to their impedance.

But the transformer's windings have their own impedances given. However, when connected as an autotransformer, the effective impedance seen by the source would be different. I think I need to adjust the impedances based on the turns ratio.

Wait, the transformer's original impedances are given for their respective windings. Winding A (220V) has impedance 0.24 + j0.40 ohms, and Winding B (110V) has 0.05 + j0.09 ohms.

But when connected as an autotransformer, perhaps only one of the windings is used. Or maybe both are used in a series or parallel configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the autotransformer uses the series connection of both windings. Wait, no, the problem states it's a two-winding transformer connected as an autotransformer, so maybe only one winding is used, and the other is perhaps unused or shorted? Or maybe the two windings are combined in a certain way.

Wait, perhaps the autotransformer uses the 220V winding (Winding A) in such a way that part of it is used for the tap. So the total number of turns would be N, and the tap is at kN turns, where k is 2/3 as calculated earlier.

In that case, the impedance of the autotransformer's winding would be based on Winding A's impedance, adjusted by the square of the ratio of the tapped turns to the total turns.

Wait, in a transformer, the impedance seen at the terminals is (impedance) * (turns_ratio)^2, where turns_ratio is the ratio of the tapped turns to the total turns.

So, the total turns are N, and the tapped portion is kN (k=2/3). So the impedance seen from the source would be (Z) * (k)^2, where Z is the impedance of the entire winding.

Wait, but Winding A's impedance is given as 0.24 + j0.40 ohms when connected to 220V. So, the total impedance of Winding A at that voltage is 0.24 + j0.40 ohms.

If the autotransformer uses a portion of Winding A, say kN turns (k=2/3), then the impedance seen from the source (connected across kN turns) would be Z_A * (k)^2. Because the impedance scales with the square of the turns ratio.

Wait, that makes sense. So the impedance per turn is (0.24 + j0.40)/(N^2), so for kN turns, it would be (0.24 + j0.40) * (k^2).

So, for k=2/3, the impedance would be (0.24 + j0.40) * (4/9) = 0.24*(4/9)=0.1067, and j0.40*(4/9)=0.1778. So approximately 0.1067 + j0.1778 ohms.

Wait, but the source is connected to the entire Winding A, which is 220V, but the source voltage is 330V. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because Winding A is only rated for 220V. So perhaps I've made a wrong assumption.

Wait, maybe the autotransformer isn't using Winding A but Winding B. Because Winding B is 110V, and 330V is three times that. So a = 3, and k= (220/330)= 2/3. So the autotransformer would use Winding B, with a tap at 2/3 of its turns.

So the total impedance of Winding B is 0.05 + j0.09 ohms at 110V. If the tap is at 2/
