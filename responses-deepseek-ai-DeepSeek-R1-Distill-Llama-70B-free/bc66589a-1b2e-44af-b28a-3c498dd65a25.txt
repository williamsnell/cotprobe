Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about solubility and precipitation. Hmm, let me think. The question is about finding the minimum concentration of Br- ions needed to precipitate AgBr from a solution where the Ag+ concentration is 1e-5 M. The Ksp for AgBr is 4e-13. 

Wait, Ksp is the solubility product, right? So AgBr dissociates into Ag+ and Br- ions. The Ksp expression would be Ksp = [Ag+][Br-]. Oh yeah, and when the product of their concentrations exceeds Ksp, precipitation happens. So here, we're to find when precipitation just begins, which is when [Ag+][Br-] equals Ksp.

So the given [Ag+] is 1e-5 M. Let me plug that into the equation. Ksp = (1e-5) * [Br-] = 4e-13. Oh wait, I need to solve for [Br-]. So rearranging that, [Br-] = Ksp / [Ag+]. 

Calculating that: 4e-13 divided by 1e-5. Hmm, 4e-13 / 1e-5 = 4e-8? Let me see, because 1e-5 is 10^-5. So 4e-13 divided by 1e-5 is 4e-8. Wait, yes, because when you divide exponents with the same base, you subtract them. So 10^-13 divided by 10^-5 is 10^(-13+5) = 10^-8. So 4 * 10^-8. 

Now looking at the options: Option I is 4e-8 M, which matches my calculation. So the answer should be I. 

Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Oh right, because to reach the Ksp, that's the minimum [Br-] needed. Because if [Br-] is lower than that, the product would be below Ksp, and no precipitation. So yeah, 4e-8 M is the correct minimum concentration.

To determine the minimum concentration of Br⁻ ions required to precipitate AgBr, we use the solubility product constant (Ksp) expression:

\[
K_{sp} = [\text{Ag}^+][\text{Br}^-]
\]

Given:
- \([\text{Ag}^+] = 1 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}\)
- \(K_{sp} = 4 \times 10^{-13}\)

Rearranging the equation to solve for \([\text{Br}^-]\):

\[
[\text{Br}^-] = \frac{K_{sp}}{[\text{Ag}^+]} = \frac{4 \times 10^{-13}}{1 \times 10^{-5}}
\]

Performing the calculation:

\[
[\text{Br}^-] = 4 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}
\]

This matches option **I**. The minimum concentration of Br⁻ ions required to bring about precipitation is \(4 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\).

Answer: I
