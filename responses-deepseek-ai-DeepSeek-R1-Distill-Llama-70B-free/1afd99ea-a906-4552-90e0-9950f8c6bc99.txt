Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about a child's temperament based on a scenario. The question is about a 3-year-old on her first day of preschool. Let's break it down.

The child is holding her mother's hand tightly and watching other kids play. Then, after a few minutes and some coaxing from the teacher, she starts helping another child with a puzzle. The question is asking what temperament style this child has according to Thomas and Chess.

I remember that Thomas and Chess proposed nine temperament traits, but they also categorized children into three broad groups: easy, difficult, and slow to warm up. Wait, no, actually, the three main categories are easy, difficult, and slow to warm up. The nine traits are more specific, like activity level, adaptability, etc.

So the main types are based on how the child adapts to new situations. The easy child is adaptable, approaches new situations positively. The difficult child is more challenging, maybe resistant. The slow to warm up child takes time to adjust, might be shy at first but warms up gradually.

In the scenario, the child is initially hesitant, clinging to her mother, and observing. But after some coaxing, she starts to participate. So she didn't immediately join in but needed some time and encouragement. That sounds like a slow to warm up temperament because she's not immediately comfortable but does adapt after a bit.

Looking at the options, option I is "Slow to warm up." That makes sense. The other options don't fit as well. "Easy" would mean she adapts quickly, which she didn't. "Difficult" implies more resistance or negative reactions, which isn't shown here. So I think the correct answer is I.

The child in the scenario exhibits behavior consistent with the "slow to warm up" temperament style. After initial hesitation and needing encouragement, she gradually adapts and engages. 

Answer: I
