Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because probability sometimes confuses me, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a segment of length 10. Points A and B are chosen randomly on this segment. These points divide the segment into three smaller segments. The question is asking for the probability that these three smaller segments can form the sides of a triangle. The options are given from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Alright, so first, I remember that for three lengths to form a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. That's the triangle inequality theorem. So each of the three segments must satisfy this condition with the other two.

Let me visualize this. Imagine a straight line segment of length 10. Points A and B are somewhere along this line, dividing it into three parts. Let's call the lengths of these parts x, y, and z. So the total is x + y + z = 10.

But wait, actually, how are the points arranged? Are A and B placed in any order, or is there a specific arrangement? Oh, right, because points A and B are chosen randomly, I guess they can be anywhere along the segment. So the positions of A and B can vary, which means the lengths x, y, z can vary too.

But wait, when choosing two points randomly on a line, the order matters. Or does it? Hmm. Let me think. Suppose the segment is from 0 to 10. Let's say point A is at position a and point B is at position b, where a and b are between 0 and 10. But since they are chosen randomly, a and b could be in any order. So to avoid confusion, I can assume that a is less than b, and then consider the cases where a is less than b and the other way around. But perhaps it's easier to fix a and b such that a is always less than b. Since the problem is symmetric, I can just consider a < b and calculate the probability for that case, then it would apply to the reverse scenario as well.

Wait, but actually, when choosing two points at random on a line segment, the probability space is usually modeled by picking two independent random variables between 0 and 10. So the positions a and b could be anywhere, and the order doesn't matter because the segments are just the distances between them.

But for the purpose of calculation, I can assume that a is less than b, which would make the three segments as a, (b - a), and (10 - b). Then, I can calculate the conditions under which these three lengths satisfy the triangle inequality.

So the three lengths are: a, b - a, and 10 - b.

Wait, but if a can be anywhere from 0 to 10, and similarly for b, then perhaps the standard approach is to model this using a unit square where a and b are points within the square [0,10] x [0,10]. But to simplify, since a and b are two points, sometimes it's easier to fix a ≤ b to avoid double-counting, so the area of the sample space where a < b would be a triangle with area (10^2)/2 = 50. Then, the probability would be the favorable area divided by the total area.

Wait, but in the problem, points A and B are chosen such that they divide the segment into three parts. So perhaps the order of A and B doesn't matter, so a and b can be anywhere, and we can consider all possible positions.

But let me get back to the triangle conditions. For the three lengths to form a triangle, each length must be less than the sum of the other two.

So for the three lengths x, y, z:

x + y > z
x + z > y
y + z > x

But since x + y + z = 10, we can substitute. Let's pick one condition, say x + y > z. But since x + y = 10 - z, the condition becomes 10 - z > z → 10 > 2z → z < 5.

Similarly, the same condition applies to x and y. So each of x, y, z must be less than 5.

Wait, that's a key insight. Because each of them must be less than 5 for all three conditions to hold. Because if any of them is 5 or more, say z ≥5, then x + y =10 - z ≤5, so x + y would be less than or equal to z, violating the triangle condition.

So the problem reduces to finding the probability that all three segments are less than 5.

So the condition is that a <5, (b - a) <5, and (10 - b) <5.

Wait, let me check that again. Because the three segments are a, (b - a), and (10 - b). So each of these must be less than 5.

So the conditions are:

1. a <5
2. (b - a) <5 → b < a +5
3. (10 - b) <5 → b >5

Wait, condition 3: 10 - b <5 → 10 -5 < b → b>5.

So combining all three conditions:

a <5,

b >5,

and b < a +5.

Wait, but a and b are positions along the segment, with a and b each between 0 and 10. Also, considering that a and b can be in any order, but perhaps to simplify, we can assume a < b as earlier, but the conditions might change.

Wait, perhaps I should model this without assuming a < b. Let me think.

Let me represent the possible positions of a and b as points in a 10x10 square, where the x-axis is a and y-axis is b. The total area is 100.

But since a and b are chosen independently and uniformly, the probability is the area of the region where all three conditions are satisfied divided by 100.

But the three conditions are:

a <5,

b < a +5,

and b >5.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should approach this by considering that for the three segments to each be less than 5, the two points A and B must lie in such a way that no two points are more than 5 units apart, and the ends are also within 5 units from the points.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to model the problem by considering the positions a and b, with a < b. So the three segments would be a, b - a, and 10 - b. Each of these must be less than 5.

So the conditions are:

a <5,

b - a <5 → b < a +5,

10 - b <5 → b>5.

So in this case, since a < b, and a is less than 5, and b must be greater than 5, but also less than a +5.

Wait, but a is less than 5, so a +5 is less than 10. So the condition is that b is between 5 and a +5, and a <5.

Let me try to visualize the area in the a-b plane.

In the a-b plane, a ranges from 0 to10, and b ranges from 0 to10. The region where a <b is the area above the diagonal a = b.

So the conditions are:

a <5,

b>5,

b < a +5.

So with a <5, b must be between 5 and a +5, but a +5 can't exceed 10 since a is less than 5.

Wait, when a is less than 5, a +5 is less than 10 only when a is less than 5, which it is. So for each a from 0 to5, b must be between 5 and a+5.

But in the a <b region, so that's where b is greater than a but less than a+5, and also greater than 5.

Wait, no, because in the a <b region, the condition is that a <b, but the other conditions are b>5 and b <a+5.

So the region is defined by:

a <5,

5 <b <a +5,

and a <b.

So combining these, for each a from 0 to5, b must be between max(a,5) and a+5.

Wait, because since a can be less than 5, but b has to be greater than 5, and also greater than a. So when a is greater than 5, but in our case a is less than 5, so max(a,5) is 5.

Wait no, a is from 0 to5, so when a is less than 5, then 5 is the lower limit for b.

So for each a in [0,5), b must be in [5, a+5), but also since a <b, and a is less than5, so 5 is greater than a when a <5. So for a <5, b must be in [5, a+5), but also a <b. So the lower limit for b is 5, but the upper limit is a+5.

But wait, let's check that with a specific value. Let's say a=3. Then b must be between5 and 8 (since a+5=8). And since a <b is already satisfied because 3 <5, that's okay.

Similarly, when a is 4, b must be between5 and9.

When a is 0, b must be between5 and5 (since a +5=5). But wait, that can't be right because a=0, then a+5=5. So for a=0, b would have to be between5 and5, which is only b=5. But that's a single point, which has zero area. So perhaps the region is a bit more nuanced.

Wait, maybe I should sketch the region in the a-b plane.

In the a-b plane, the square is from (0,0) to (10,10). The line a + b is irrelevant; the conditions are a <5, b>5, and b <a+5, with a <b.

So the region is where a is between 0 and5, and for each a, b runs from 5 to a +5, but also b must be greater than a, because a <b.

Wait, but when a is less than5, and b is greater than5, then for a <5, 5 is greater than a if a is less than5. So for a <5, b can start at5, which is greater than a. So for a from0 to5, b ranges from5 to a +5.

Wait, but when a approaches5, a +5 approaches10, so for a=5, b would be from5 to10. But in our case, a is strictly less than5, so a+5 is strictly less than10.

So the region is a triangle? Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of integration. The area where a is in [0,5], and b is in [5, a+5], with a <b.

Wait, but in the a <b region, which is the upper triangle of the square.

So the boundaries for a are from 0 to5.

For each a in [0,5], b starts at max(a,5). Since a <5, max(a,5) is 5.

And b goes up to a +5.

So the area would be the integral from a=0 to a=5 of (a+5 -5) da, because from b=5 to b=a+5, the length is (a+5) -5 =a.

So the integral becomes ∫ from 0 to5 of a da = [ (1/2)a² ] from 0 to5 → (1/2)(25) -0 =12.5.

Wait, but wait a second. Because in the a <b region, the area where a is between0 and5 and b is between5 and a+5 is a region that's a kind of parallelogram or triangle.

Wait, but if I'm calculating the area as ∫ (a+5 -5) da from a=0 to5, that's ∫a da from0 to5, which is 12.5.

But the total area of the sample space where a <b is (10*10)/2=50.

Wait, but wait, no. Because the condition applies to the entire square, but we're considering a <b, which is half the square, area=50.

So if the favorable area in this region is 12.5, then the probability would be 12.5 /50 =0.25, which is 25%.

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Because the favorable area is 12.5, which is 25% of 50. Hmm.

But wait, let me think again. So the favorable area is the area where a <5, b>5, and b <a+5, with a <b. So in the a <b region, the area is 12.5.

But wait, let me visualize it again. So in the a-b plane, a goes from0 to5, and for each a, b goes from5 to a+5.

But when a is 0, b goes from5 to5, which is zero length. When a is5, b goes from5 to10, which is length5.

So the region is a triangle with vertices at (0,5), (5,5), and (5,10). So the area of this triangle is (base * height)/2. The base along a=5 is from b=5 tob=10, which is5 units. The height along a is from0 to5.

Wait, but that's a right triangle with base5 and height5, so area is (5*5)/2=12.5, which matches the integral result.

So the favorable area is12.5.

But wait, because in the a <b region, the total area is50, so the probability would be12.5 /50=0.25, which is25%.

But wait, the problem didn't specify whether a and b are ordered or not. Oh wait, I think I considered a <b, so the area is12.5 in that region. But since the total possible area is100 (the entire square), then maybe I should calculate the probability differently.

Wait no, because when considering all possible a and b, including a >b, the favorable area would be double the area I calculated, because the same conditions apply when a >b.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to consider the problem without assuming a <b. Let me try that.

So, without assuming a <b, the three segments are |a -b| (the distance between A and B), the distance from0 to the smaller of a and b, and the distance from the larger of a and b to10.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as follows: the three segments are min(a, b), |a - b|, and 10 - max(a, b).

So for the three segments to form a triangle, each must be less than5.

So the conditions are:

min(a, b) <5,

|a -b| <5,

and 10 - max(a, b) <5 → max(a, b) >5.

So combining these, both min(a, b) <5 and max(a, b) >5, and |a -b| <5.

Wait, but if max(a, b) >5, then at least one of a or b is greater than5. And min(a, b) <5, so the smaller of the two is less than5.

So the two points a and b are on either side of5, and the distance between them is less than5.

So the region where a and b satisfy these conditions.

Let me try to model this in the a-b plane.

The condition max(a, b) >5 means that either a >5 or b >5.

The condition min(a, b) <5 means that a <5 or b <5. Wait, no, min(a, b) <5 is always true unless both a and b are >=5, but since we have max(a, b) >5, then one is >=5 and the other can be anything.

Wait, perhaps it's better to split into cases where a >5 and b <5, or b >5 and a <5.

Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, let's think of the region where one variable is greater than5 and the other is less than5, and their difference is less than5.

So the region in the a-b plane is where (a >5 and b <5 and a - b <5) OR (b >5 and a <5 and b -a <5).

These are two symmetrical regions, each contributing the same area.

Let's compute the area for one case, say a >5 and b <5, and a -b <5.

So in this case, a ranges from5 to10, and b ranges from max(0, a -5) to5.

Wait, because a - b <5 → b >a -5.

Since a is greater than5, a -5 is greater than0. So for a from5 to10, b ranges from (a -5) to5.

So the area for this case is the integral from a=5 to10 of (5 - (a -5)) da = ∫ (10 -a) da from5 to10.

Calculating that integral:

∫ (10 -a) da from5 to10 is [10a - (1/2)a²] from5 to10.

At a=10: 10*10 - 0.5*100 =100 -50=50.

At a=5: 10*5 -0.5*25=50 -12.5=37.5.

So the difference is50 -37.5=12.5.

So the area for one case is12.5. Since there are two symmetrical cases (a >5, b <5 and vice versa), the total favorable area is12.5 *2=25.

Wait, but wait, no, because in each case, the area is12.5, so together they make25.

Wait, but the total area of the sample space is10*10=100, so the probability is25/100=0.25, which is25%.

Wait, that's the same result as before. So this makes sense.

So the probability is25%, which is option A.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other conditions. Because earlier I thought of the three conditions as each segment being less than5, but perhaps there's a more efficient way to think about it.

Alternatively, another approach: imagine the two points A and B are placed
