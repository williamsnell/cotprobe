Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a lead bullet melting when it hits a steel slab. I'm a bit rusty on thermodynamics, but let's try to think this through step by step.

The question is asking for the speed v of the bullet. The given data includes the initial temperature T0 = 300 K, melting point T1 = 700 K, heat of melting q = 5 cal per gram, and specific heat c = 0.03 cal per gram per Kelvin. 

Hmm. I remember that when a bullet strikes something, it's subject to a lot of friction, which generates heat. This heat energy probably causes the temperature of the bullet to rise. If enough heat is generated, the bullet's temperature will increase to its melting point and beyond, causing it to melt.

Wait, but how does the speed tie into this? Oh right, the kinetic energy of the bullet is converted into heat upon impact. So the kinetic energy (KE) must provide enough heat to first raise the bullet's temperature to its melting point and then to melt it.

So the formula I think I need is the kinetic energy equation. The kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², where m is mass and v is velocity. But wait, I don't know the mass of the bullet. Hmm, maybe the mass cancels out somehow?

Let's think about the heat required. There are two parts: heating the bullet from T0 to T1, and then melting it. The heat for temperature rise is Q1 = m c (T1 - T0), and the heat for melting is Q2 = m q. So the total heat Q = Q1 + Q2 = m [c(T1 - T0) + q].

This heat Q must come from the kinetic energy of the bullet. So (1/2)m v² = m [c(T1 - T0) + q]. Oh wait, the mass m appears on both sides, so they can cancel out. That makes sense because the required speed shouldn't depend on the mass of the bullet.

So after canceling m, I get (1/2) v² = c (T1 - T0) + q.

Plugging in the numbers: T1 is 700 K, T0 300 K. So T1 - T0 is 400 K.

c is 0.03 cal/(g·K), and q is 5 cal/g.

So c*(T1-T0) is 0.03 * 400 = 12 cal/g. Adding q, which is 5, gives 17 cal/g.

So (1/2) v² = 17 cal/g. Wait, but units. Oh wait, I need to make sure all units are consistent. Because in SI units, kinetic energy is in joules, but here everything is in calories and grams.

Wait, calories and grams might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I should convert the calorie units into joules. But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can remember that 1 calorie is about 4.184 joules, but I'm not sure if I need to convert here.

Wait no, the equation I have is (1/2) v^2 equals the sum of the terms which are in cal/g. But wait, (1/2) v^2 would be in (m/s)^2, but how does that equate to cal/g? I think maybe I'm missing a step.

Wait, I think I'm mixing energy units. Let me think again. The kinetic energy is (1/2) m v², and that equals the heat energy, which is m times [c (T1-T0) + q]. So when we divide both sides by m, we get (1/2) v² = c (T1-T0) + q.

Wait, but no, because c is in cal/(g·K), and T is in K. So c*(T1-T0) is cal/g. Similarly, q is cal/g. So adding them gives cal/g. Then (1/2) v² must be in cal/g as well. Hmm, but v is in m/s. So how do we get cal/g from (m/s)^2?

Ah, I think I need to relate energy units. Let's see: kinetic energy in calories. Because 1 calorie is 4.184 joules, and 1 joule is 1 kg·m²/s². So perhaps I should express everything in terms of calories.

Wait, but maybe I can find a way to relate v² in m²/s² to calories per gram. Let me think about the units. Let's see.

The equation is:

(1/2) v² = [c (ΔT) + q] 

The left side is in (m²/s²), and the right side is in cal/g. So to make the units match, I need to convert (m²/s²) into cal/g.

How?

I think I need to use the conversion factor between energy units. Let's see: 1 calorie is approximately 4.184 joules. 1 joule is kg·m²/s². So 1 cal = 4.184 kg·m²/s².

Wait, but we're dealing with grams, not kilograms. So 1 cal = 4.184 * 10^3 g * m²/s²? Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think: 1 kg is 1000 g, so 1 joule (which is kg·m²/s²) is 1000 g * m²/s². So 1 cal is 4.184 * 1000 g·m²/s². So 1 cal = 4184 g·m²/s².

So, 1 cal/g = 4184 (g·m²/s²) / g = 4184 m²/s².

So going back to the equation:

(1/2) v² = [c ΔT + q] (cal/g)

But [c ΔT + q] is in cal/g, which is equal to 4184 m²/s².

So,

(1/2) v² = [ (0.03 cal/(g·K) * 400 K) + 5 cal/g ] * (4184 m²/s² / 1 cal/g )

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The right-hand side is [c (T1 - T0) + q], which is in cal/g. So when we multiply by 4184 m²/(s² cal/g) , we get m²/s². Because cal/g multiplied by (m²/s² per cal/g) gives m²/s².

So, (1/2) v² = (17 cal/g) * (4184 m²/(s²·cal/g)) )

Because 17 cal/g multiplied by 4184 m²/s² per cal/g gives 17 * 4184 m²/s².

So (1/2) v² = 17 * 4184.

Let me compute that. 17 * 4000 is 68,000. 17 * 184 is... 17*180=3060, 17*4=68 → 3060+68=3128. So total is 68,000 + 3128 = 71,128 m²/s².

So (1/2) v² =71,128 → v² = 2 *71,128 = 142,256 → v is sqrt(142256).

What's the square root of 142256? Let's see. 300² is 90,000. 400² is 160,000. So it's between 300 and 400. Let me compute 378²: 378 * 378. 300²=90k, 78²=6,084, and cross terms: 2 * 300 *78=46,800. So 90,000 +46,800 +6,084= 142,884. Oh wait, that's larger than 142,256.

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me try 376². 376 = 300 +76. So (300+76)^2=300² + 2*300*76 +76².

300²=90,000. 2*300*76= 45,600. 76²=5,776.

So 90,000 +45,600=135,600; +5,776=141,376. That's less than 142,256.

So 376²=141,376 and 377²= (376+1)^2=376² + 2*376 +1=141,376 + 752 +1=142,129.

Wait, our target is 142,256. So 377²=142,129 <142,256. Next, 378²=142,884 as earlier.

So 142,256 is between 377 and 378. Let's compute 377.5². 377.5 = (377 +378)/2.

377.5² = (377 + 0.5)^2 = 377² + 2*377*0.5 + 0.25 = 142,129 + 377 +0.25 =142,506.25. Wait, that's higher than 142,256. So our target is between 377 and 377.5.

Wait, but perhaps I can approximate. The exact value is sqrt(142256)= approx 377.2 m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are E:400, D:380, etc. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: 420

B:450

C:500

D:380

E:400

F:300

G:350

H:275

I:320

J:340.

Hmm. 377 is closest to D:380 m/s. But wait, my calculation of 17 cal/g gave me 142,256 m²/s², so v is about 377 m/s. So the closest option is D:380.

Wait, but wait a second, did I make any mistake in the calculations?

Let me go through the steps again.

First, the heat required is Q = m c ΔT + m q.

Kinetic energy (1/2 m v²) must equal Q, so (1/2 m v²) = m (c ΔT + q). Mass m cancels out, so (1/2) v² = c ΔT + q.

c is 0.03 cal/g.K, ΔT is 400 K. So 0.03 *400=12 cal/g.

q is 5 cal/g. So total 17 cal/g.

Then, 1 cal/g is 4184 m²/s². So 17 *4184 = 71,128.

So (1/2) v² =71,128 → v²=142,256 → v= sqrt(142256)= approx 377 m/s.

So the correct answer should be around 377 m/s. Looking at the options, the closest is D:380 m/s. But wait, maybe I messed up the conversion factor?

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the conversion from cal to m²/s².

1 calorie is 4.184 joules. 1 joule is 1 kg·m²/s².

So 1 cal =4.184 kg·m²/s² =4184 g·m²/s². So 1 cal/g =4184 m²/s², correct.

So 17 cal/g =17 *4184 m²/s² =71,128 m²/s².

So the calculation seems correct. So v is about 377 m/s. But the options don't have 377. The closest is D:380, which is 3 m/s higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in arithmetic.

Wait another thought. Did I compute 17 *4184 correctly?

17 *4000=68,000.

17 * 184=?

17 *100=1700.

17 *84= 1428.

So 1700 +1428= 3128.

So 68,000 +3,128=71,128. That's correct. So yes, 71,128.

So v squared is 142,256. Let me compute the square root more accurately.

We can write 142256 as (377.2)^2.

Because, as I said, 377^2 is 142,129, and 377.2^2 is 377^2 + 2*(377)*(0.2) + (0.2)^2 =142129 + 150.4 + 0.04=142279.44. Oh wait, that's higher than 142256.

Wait, perhaps 377.1^2. Let's compute:

377 + 0.1. So (377.1)^2 =377² + 2*377*0.1 + (0.1)^2 =142129 +75.4 +0.01=142204.41.

Still lower than 142256.

377.2^2 is 142204.41 + 2*377*(0.1) +0.01 = wait, no, perhaps better to compute directly.

Wait, 377.1^2=142204.41.

So 142204.41 + (377.1 *2 +1)*0.1 + ... Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 377.2^2 as follows:

377.2 *377.2:

Let me compute 377 *377 = 142,129.

Then, 377 *0.2 =75.4.

0.2 *377 =75.4.

0.2 *0.2=0.04.

Wait, perhaps using (a + b)^2 formula.

(377 + 0.2)^2 =377^2 + 2*377*0.2 + 0.2^2= 142,129 + 150.8 +0.04=142,129+150.8=142,279.8 +0.04=142,279.84.

So 377.2^2=142,279.84.

Our target is 142,256. So it's between 377.1 and 377.2.

At 377.1: 142,204.41.

At 377.15: let's compute.

377.15^2= (377.1 +0.05)^2=377.1^2 + 2*377.1 *0.05 +0.05^2=142204.41 +37.71 +0.0025=142204.41+37.71=142242.12 +0.0025=142242.1225.

Still less than 142,256.

Next, 377.175^2.

But maybe this is getting too detailed. The point is, the exact value is around 377 m/s, but the options don't have this exact value. The closest option is D:380 m/s, which is 3 m/s higher.

Wait, but another thought. Did I mix up grams and kilograms somewhere?

Wait, in the conversion from cal to m²/s², I think I did it right. 1 cal is 4184 g·m²/s², so 1 cal/g is 4184 m²/s².

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in treating the units earlier. Let me double-check.

The equation is (1/2)v² = [c (T1-T0) + q] * (4184 m²/s² per cal/g).

So [c (T1-T0) + q] is 17 cal/g.

So 17 cal/g * 4184 m²/(s² cal/g) )=17 *4184 m²/s²=71,128 m²/s².

So (1/2) v² =71128 → v²=142256 →v= sqrt(142256)= approx 377 m/s.

Hmm. So why isn't 380 an exact match? Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere. Let me recheck the numbers.

Wait, the heat of melting q is 5 cal/g. Specific heat c is 0.03 cal/(g·K). So c*(T1-T0)=0.03*400=12. 12 +5=17. That's correct.

So the calculation seems right, but perhaps the options don't have 377. Let me look again at the options.

Options are:

A:420

B:450

C:500

D:380

E:400

F:300

G:350

H:275

I:320

J:340.

So D is 380, which is the closest. But wait, the exact calculation gives about 377, which is 3 less than 380. So perhaps the intended answer is D:380. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial steps.

Wait another thought: perhaps the initial KE equation should include the gravitational conversion factor. Wait, no, because we're dealing with SI units here. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used a different value for the conversion between cal and joules?

Wait, I'm pretty sure 1 cal is 4.184 J. So 1 cal = 4.184 J. But wait, perhaps in some contexts, like thermochemistry, calories are defined differently, but I think that's the standard conversion.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the use of a different value, such as 1 cal = 4.18 J, but that's roughly the same.

Wait, let me recalculate with 4.18 J/cal instead of 4.184.

So 1 cal =4.18 J =4.18 kg·m²/s².

So 1 cal/g =4180 m²/s² (since 4.18 *1000 g=4180 g, but wait, no, 1 cal=4.18 J, which is 4.18 kg·m²/s². So 1 cal/g is 4.18 *1000 m²/s², because 1 kg=1000 g. So 1 cal/g =4180 m²/s².

So then 17 cal/g =17 *4180=71,060 m²/s².

So (1/2) v² =71,060 →v²=142,120 →v= sqrt(142120) ≈377.0 m/s.

Same result as before, so the slight difference in the 4th decimal place doesn't affect the result.

So I think my calculation is correct, giving v≈377 m/s. Since the options don't have this exact number, but D is 380, which is very close, perhaps that's the intended answer.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again.

Wait, the bullet is striking a steel slab. Is all the kinetic energy converted into heat? Well, the problem probably assumes that all the KE is converted into heat, so the setup is correct.

Another possibility: perhaps the specific heat is per gram per Kelvin,
