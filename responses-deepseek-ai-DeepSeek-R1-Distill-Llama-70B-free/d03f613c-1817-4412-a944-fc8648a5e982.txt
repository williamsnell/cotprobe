Question:

Suppose you discovered a new species of bioluminescent worm . How could you prove that it was the worm itself and not some contaminating bacteria that was producing the light ?

Options:

A: Feed the worm with special food
B: Place the light-producing substance in complete growth media or examine it under a microscope
C: Observe the worm in a dark environment
D: Expose the worm to sunlight
E: Treat the worm with antibiotics to eliminate potential bacteria

Okay, so I have this question about a bioluminescent worm, and I need to figure out how to prove it's the worm itself producing the light, not bacteria. Hmm. Let's think through this.

The question gives me a scenario where a new species of worm that glows has been discovered. But the challenge is determining whether the light is coming from the worm or from bacteria that might be contaminating it. So, I need an experiment or method to confirm the source of the bioluminescence.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Feed the worm with special food. I'm not sure how that would help. Maybe if the food affects the bacteria, but I don't see a direct link to proving it's the worm.

Option B: Place the light-producing substance in complete growth media or examine under a microscope. Hmm, placing the substance in media might allow bacteria to grow, but I'm not sure. Or maybe examining the worm under a microscope could show if the light comes from within the worm's cells.

Option C: Observe the worm in a dark environment. Well, that would just make the glow more noticeable, but it doesn't really test the source.

Option D: Expose the worm to sunlight. Maybe to see if the light affects it, but again, not directly proving the source of the bioluminescence.

Option E: Treat the worm with antibiotics to eliminate potential bacteria. Oh, that's interesting. If you use antibiotics and the worm stops glowing, that suggests bacteria were causing it. But wait, if the worm's glow remains after antibiotics, then it's the worm producing light. That makes sense because antibiotics would kill bacteria but not the worm. So if the glow is still there, it's the worm.

Wait, but how does that work exactly? Let me think. Bioluminescence in organisms like fireflies or certain plankton is usually produced by the organism itself, often involving specific genes or chemicals. If there's a possibility of contamination with bacteria that emit light (like certain marine bacteria), treating with antibiotics would kill the bacteria. If the glow goes away, bacteria were the cause. If it remains, it's the worm.

So the correct approach would be to eliminate bacteria and see if the bioluminescence stops. That points to option E.

But wait, option B says placing the substance in media. Maybe that's a culture medium. If you take the substance (like the worm's extract) and put it in media, if bacteria grow and produce light, that's contamination. But if the light is only from the worm, maybe not. Alternatively, examining under a microscope might show if the light is coming from the worm's cells or from bacteria on its surface.

Hmm, but I think option E is more direct. Treating with antibiotics should specifically target bacteria. If after treatment, the worm still glows, then it's the worm producing the light. That seems like a solid test.

So the answer should be E.

To determine whether the bioluminescence is produced by the worm itself or by contaminating bacteria, the most effective approach is to treat the worm with antibiotics. Antibiotics specifically target and eliminate bacteria while leaving the worm unaffected. If the worm stops glowing after treatment, it indicates that bacteria were the source of the light. Conversely, if the worm continues to glow, it confirms that the bioluminescence is produced by the worm itself. This method directly isolates the source of the bioluminescence and provides a clear answer.
