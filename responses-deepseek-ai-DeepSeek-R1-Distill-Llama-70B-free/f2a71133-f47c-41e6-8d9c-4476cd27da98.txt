Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"The Chinese are all infidels: they worship images, and burn their dead just like the [Hindus]. The King of China is a Tartar, and one of the descendants of [Ghenghis] Khan…In all the Chinese provinces, there is a town for the [Muslims], and in this they reside. They also have cells, colleges, and mosques, and are made much of by the Kings of China…
When we approached this city [of Hangzhou] we were met by its judge, the [elders] of Islamism, and the great merchants. The [Muslims] are exceedingly numerous here. This whole city is surrounded by a wall: each of the six [districts of Hangzhou] is also surrounded by a wall. In the first reside the guards, with their commander. I was told that, in the muster-rolls, these amount to twelve thousand…In the second division are the Jews, Christians, and the Turks who worship the sun: these are numerous, their number is not known: and theirs is the most beautiful city. Their streets are well disposed, and their great men are exceedingly wealthy. There are in the city a great number of [Muslims], with some of whom I resided for fifteen days; and was treated most [honorably]…"

Okay, I need to figure out the correct answer to this question about changes in Chinese trade policies under the Ming Dynasty. Let me start by understanding the question and the provided information.

The question is referring to Ibn Battuta's travels, which took place in the 14th century. He describes the presence of Muslims, Jews, Christians, and Turks in Hangzhou, noting that each group resides in specific areas. The city is divided into six districts, each with its own walls. Ibn Battuta was treated well and stayed with some Muslims for a while.

So the question is asking which policy change regarding trade occurred under the Ming Dynasty. The options are from A to J, each describing a different policy.

First, I should recall what I know about the Ming Dynasty's trade policies. I remember that the Ming Dynasty, which came after the Yuan (Mongol) Dynasty, had a different approach to foreign trade. Initially, the Ming were more isolationist compared to the Yuan, who were more open to foreign trade and cultural exchanges.

One of the key policies I remember is the "haijin," which was a sea ban. The Ming government restricted maritime trade, especially during certain periods. They also had a system where foreign merchants were allowed to trade only at specific ports and under strict regulations. For example, they might have been limited to certain areas in the ports to control their activities and movements.

Looking at the options:

Option B says the government restricted foreign merchants to specific sites in coastal cities. That sounds familiar because I think the Ming had designated areas like the "foreign quarters" where merchants from outside could live and conduct their business. This would fit with the description in Ibn Battuta's account, where different groups were in separate districts.

Option A suggests a complete ban on foreign trade, but I don't think that's correct because while the Ming did restrict trade, they didn't eliminate it entirely. They still allowed some trade, especially through official channels like the tribute system.

Option C talks about requiring foreign merchants to adopt Chinese customs. I'm not sure about this. While there might have been expectations, I don't recall this being a major policy change specifically under the Ming regarding trade.

Option D mentions endorsing Chinese merchants to go abroad. The Ming actually discouraged private overseas trade and focused more on internal trade or state-controlled external trade through the tribute system.

Option E is about Confucian principles and merchants in government. I don't think the Ming abandoned Confucianism; in fact, they reinforced it. Also, merchants weren't typically given greater roles in local government during the Ming.

Option F suggests eliminating all trade restrictions, which contradicts what I know about the Ming's restrictive policies.

Option G says unrestricted trade throughout the country, which doesn't fit with the Ming's tendency towards control and restriction.

Option H is about prominent roles for foreign merchants in government. That doesn't seem right because the Ming were more likely to restrict foreigners' influence rather than give them government roles.

Option I is about heavy taxes on foreign merchants. I'm not certain, but it's possible. However, the more prominent policy I remember is the restriction to specific areas rather than just taxing.

Option J refers to monopolizing production and sale of resources like salt and iron. That's something the Ming did, but it's more about internal economic policies rather than trade policies with foreigners.

So putting it all together, the key change under the Ming was the restriction of foreign merchants to specific sites in coastal cities. This matches option B.

The Ming Dynasty implemented several policies regarding foreign trade, but the most relevant change was the restriction of foreign merchants to specific sites in coastal cities. This approach allowed the government to control and monitor trade activities more effectively, fitting with historical accounts like Ibn Battuta's description of separate districts for different groups. Other options, such as a complete ban on trade or unrestricted trade, do not align with the Ming's policies, which were more about regulation than elimination or full openness.

Answer: B
