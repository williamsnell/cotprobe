Okay, so I have this physics problem here about circuits and critical damping. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says that there's a series circuit with a capacitor and an inductor. The capacitor has a capacitance C of 0.8 microfarads, which is 0.8e-6 farads. The inductor has an inductance L of 0.2 henrys. I need to find the resistance R so that the circuit is critically damped. The options are given from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Wait, what's critical damping again? Oh right, critical damping is when the system returns to equilibrium as quickly as possible without oscillating. It's the boundary between underdamped (which oscillates) and overdamped (which doesn't oscillate but returns slowly). In electrical terms, for a series RLC circuit, critical damping occurs under a specific condition related to the resistance, inductance, and capacitance.

I remember that for critical damping in an RLC circuit, the resistance R must be such that the damping factor meets a certain criterion. I think the formula involves the square root of (4L/C). Or wait, maybe it's when the damping factor equals twice the square root of (L/C). Let me get this straight.

Oh right, in a series RLC circuit, the condition for critical damping is when the resistance R is equal to 2 times the square root of (L/C). Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The damping coefficient comes into play. Oh right, the characteristic equation for the circuit is s² + (R/L)s + (1/(LC)) = 0. For critical damping, the discriminant must be zero. The discriminant for a quadratic equation as² + bs + c is b² - 4ac. So setting that to zero gives the condition for critical damping.

So, let's set up the equation. The discriminant D is (R/L)^2 - 4*(1/L)*(1/C) = 0. Because the equation is s² + (R/L)s + (1/(LC)) = 0. Comparing to as² + bs + c = 0, a is 1, b is R/L, and c is 1/(LC). So D = (R/L)^2 - 4*(1/(LC))*(1) = 0.

Wait, wait, actually, the equation for the RLC circuit is s² + (R/(L)) s + (1/(LC)) = 0. So the discriminant D is [R/(L)]² - 4*(1/(LC))*(1) = 0. Let me compute that.

So setting D=0:
(R/(L))² - 4*(1/(L C)) ) = 0
Multiply both sides by L² to eliminate denominators:
R² - 4 L/(C) * L²? Wait, no. Let me see.

Wait, expanding [R/(L)]² is R²/L². The second term is 4*(1/(L C)). So the equation is R²/L² = 4/(L C). Multiply both sides by L²:
R² = 4 L/(C) * L²? Wait, no. Wait, 4*(1/(L C)) is 4/(L C). So,

R²/(L²) = 4/(L C)
Multiply both sides by L²:
R² = (4 L²) / (L C) )
Simplify denominator: L² / L is L, so R² = 4 L / C.

Wait, that can't be right because the units don't seem to fit. Let me check the math again.

Wait, the discriminant equation is:

(R/(L))² - 4*(1/(LC)) = 0
So,

R²/(L²) = 4/(L C)

Multiply both sides by L²:

R² = (4/(L C)) * L²
Which simplifies to R² = 4 L / C.

Ah, okay. So R squared equals (4 L) / C.

So R = sqrt( (4 L) / C )

Wait, no, because 4L/C is under the square root, so R equals the square root of (4 L / C).

Wait, wait, no. Let me correct that. No, wait:

Wait, R squared is 4 L / C. So R is the square root of (4 L / C). So,

R = sqrt( (4 * L) / C )

Now, plugging in the values given.

C is 0.8e-6 F, and L is 0.2 H.

So,

4 * L = 4 * 0.2 = 0.8.

C is 0.8e-6.

So (4 L)/C = 0.8 / (0.8e-6) = 1 / 1e-6 = 1e6.

Wait, 0.8 divided by 0.8e-6 is 1e6? Let me compute that.

Yes, because 0.8 / 0.8 = 1, and 1e6 is because we have 1 / 1e-6. So 0.8 / (0.8e-6) = 1e6.

So R squared is 1e6. Therefore, R is sqrt(1e6) = 1000 ohms.

Wait, that would make R equal to 1000 ohms. Looking at the options, option E is 1000 Ω. So the answer should be E.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me compute (4 * L) / C again.

L is 0.2 H. 4 * 0.2 is 0.8. C is 0.8e-6 F.

So 0.8 / 0.8e-6 = (0.8 / 0.8) ) / 1e-6 = 1 / 1e-6 = 1e6. Oh yes, correct.

So R squared is 1e6, so R is 1e3, which is 1000 Ω. So option E.

Wait, but another thought: I've seen another formula where the condition is R = 2 * sqrt(L/C). Let me check that.

Because sometimes, perhaps the formula for critical damping is R = 2 sqrt(L/C). Let me compute that.

So sqrt(L/C) is sqrt(0.2 / 0.8e-6).

Compute 0.2 / 0.8e-6 = (0.2 / 0.8) ) / 1e-6 = 0.25 / 1e-6 = 2.5e5.

Wait, 0.2/0.8 is 0.25, and 0.25 / 1e-6 is 2.5e5.

So sqrt(2.5e5) is sqrt(250000) which is 500.

So 2 times that is 1000. So that brings me back to the same answer, R=1000 Ω.

Yes, so both approaches give the same result. Therefore, the correct answer is E, 1000 Ω.

To determine the resistance \( R \) for critical damping in a series RLC circuit, we use the condition for critical damping:

\[
R = 2 \sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}
\]

### Given:
- Inductance \( L = 0.2 \, \mathrm{H} \)
- Capacitance \( C = 0.8 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{F} \)

### Step 1: Compute \( \frac{L}{C} \)
\[
\frac{L}{C} = \frac{0.2}{0.8 \times 10^{-6}} = \frac{0.2}{0.8} \times 10^6 = 0.25 \times 10^6 = 250,000
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \sqrt{\frac{L}{C}} \)
\[
\sqrt{\frac{L}{C}} = \sqrt{250,000} = 500
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( R \)
\[
R = 2 \times 500 = 1000 \, \Omega
\]

### Final Answer:
The resistance \( R \) for critical damping is \( 1000 \, \Omega \), which corresponds to option **E**.
