Question:

A woman took her car to a mechanic to be serviced. After doing a thorough inspection of the car, the mechanic told the woman that her car needed extensive work and that he could do all that was needed for $1,000. The parties then entered into a written contract to have the car serviced for $1,000. As the woman remembers it, at the time the written contract was formed, the parties orally agreed that if the car required any additional servicing above that detailed in the contract, it would be included in the $1,000 fee. The mechanic, however, has no recollection of any such oral agreement. While servicing the car, the mechanic discovered that a belt was severel' worn and need to be replaced. The belt replacement was not listed as work to be performed in the written contract. The mechanic telephoned the woman and told her he had found the worn belt and felt he should replace it. The woman told him to do so. When the mechanic was finished, he presented the woman with a bill for $1,100, representing the $1,000 called for by the contract and $100 for the replacement of the worn belt, which is a reasonable amount. The woman refused to pay any more than$1,000. The mechanic sued the woman to collect the $100 for the replacement of the worn belt. If the court rules in favor of the mechanic, which of the following is the most likely cause for such a ruling?

Options:

A: The mechanic had a legal obligation to replace the worn belt in order to ensure the car's safety.
B: The parties entered into a collateral oral agreement for the replacement of the worn belt that was excludable from the integrated writing.
C: The written contract was not specific about what services were included in the $1,000 fee.
D: The mechanic performed an action beyond the agreed contract and hence has the right to additional compensation.
E: An implied-in-law contract was created at the moment the mechanic replaced the worn belt.
F: The woman verbally agreed to the extra work and therefore should cover the additional costs.
G: The oral agreement was not legally binding as it was not included in the written contract.
H: The writing was construed as a complete integration of the parties' agreement.
I: The writing was construed as a partial integration of the parties' agreement.
J: The mechanic could reasonably assume that the woman would want the worn belt replaced.

Okay, so I need to figure out which answer is correct for this legal question. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The situation is about a woman and a mechanic who have a written contract for car servicing. The written contract is for $1,000. The woman claims there was an oral agreement that any additional work would be included in that $1,000. The mechanic doesn't remember such an agreement. Then, while servicing, the mechanic finds a worn belt that needs replacement, which isn't in the written contract. He calls the woman, tells her, and she says to do it. Now he's charging an extra $100, and she refuses to pay, so he sues.

The question is, if the court rules for the mechanic, why is that? I need to pick the correct option from A to J.

First, I remember that when there's a written contract, it's often considered an integrated agreement, meaning it includes all the terms and excludes prior or contemporaneous oral agreements. This is under the parol evidence rule. So if the written contract is a complete integration, any oral agreements made at the same time as the written contract can't contradict it. But wait, what if the oral agreement was made after the written contract was formed? That might be a different situation.

In this case, the written contract was formed first, and then the mechanic called about the belt. The woman agreed over the phone to replace it. So that's a subsequent oral agreement. I think that subsequent agreements can modify a written contract if they meet certain conditions. But if the written contract was a complete integration, maybe it's not so straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe the original written contract wasn't detailed enough about what was included. If the $1,000 was for a list of specific services, and the belt wasn't on that list, then the mechanic could charge extra for it. But the woman claims there was an oral agreement that any additional work would be included. If the court believes that, then the mechanic shouldn't be able to charge extra. But since the mechanic doesn't remember it, the court might not accept that there was such an agreement.

Wait, but the woman agreed orally when the mechanic called about the belt. So that's a new agreement after the original contract. So that could be a separate contract or an amendment to the original. So the mechanic could argue that she agreed to the extra work when he called. If that's the case, option F says the woman verbally agreed to the extra work and should cover the cost. But I'm not sure if that's the strongest argument.

Another angle: the written contract's terms. If it's a complete integration, the oral agreements at the time of contracting can't be used. But if the written contract isn't specific, maybe the court would allow evidence of the oral agreement. But in this case, the mechanic is trying to charge extra for work done after the contract was formed, with the woman's verbal consent.

So, if the court rules for the mechanic, the reasoning might be that the written contract didn't include the belt replacement, and the woman's subsequent verbal agreement to do the work allows the mechanic to charge for it. But I'm trying to think about the legal principles here.

Option H says the writing was a complete integration. If that's the case, any prior oral agreements (like the woman's claim about including extra work) would be excluded. But the subsequent oral agreement about the belt would be a separate issue. So if the original contract was completely integrated, the mechanic's charge would stand because the belt wasn't included, and the woman agreed to it later.

Alternatively, option B suggests a collateral oral agreement that's excludable. But I think collateral agreements are treated differently; they're not necessarily excluded by the parol evidence rule if they don't contradict the written terms.

Wait, the original written contract was for $1,000, but maybe the description of the work was not specific. So if the contract just says "$1,000 for necessary servicing," without listing each item, perhaps the court would consider whether the belt replacement was included or not. If the contract was for a "thorough servicing" and the belt was part of that, maybe the mechanic should have included it without extra charge. But if the contract listed specific parts, and the belt wasn't on the list, then the mechanic could charge extra.

Alternatively, if the written contract was a complete integration, any prior oral agreements about including extra work would be unenforceable. So the mechanic didn't have to do the extra work for free. But then, the woman's verbal agreement when he called about the belt would be a new contract or an amendment, allowing the extra charge.

So, the court might find that the written contract was a complete integration, so the prior oral agreement isn't valid. Then, the mechanic could charge for the extra work because the woman agreed to it when he called. But wait, the question is why the court ruled in favor of the mechanic, so the ruling is that he can charge the extra $100.

Looking at the options, option H says the writing was a complete integration. If that's the case, the original oral agreement isn't part of the contract. So the mechanic wasn't obliged to include extra work for free. But then, the woman later agreed to the belt replacement, so that's a separate agreement. Therefore, the mechanic can charge for it.

Alternatively, option F says the woman verbally agreed, so she should pay. But I'm not sure if the court would rely on that as the main reason, given that contracts can be modified orally in some cases.

Wait, but the original contract was written and may or may not have been a complete integration. If it was, then any prior oral agreements (like including extra work) are excluded. But the subsequent oral agreement (when the mechanic called) would be a separate agreement. So the court could find that the written contract didn't include the belt, and the woman later agreed to pay for it, so the mechanic is entitled to the extra $100.

So which option aligns with that reasoning? Option H says the writing was a complete integration. That would mean the original oral agreement about including extra work isn't part of the contract. Then, the woman's later agreement to the extra work would be a separate agreement, allowing the mechanic to charge.

Alternatively, option I says the writing was a partial integration. If that's the case, some prior oral agreements could still be valid. But the woman's claim about including extra work would still be in question.

Wait, but the question is why the court ruled in favor of the mechanic. So the mechanic is allowed to charge the extra $100 because either (1) the original written contract didn't cover it, and the woman agreed to the extra work, or (2) the original written contract was completely integrated, so the prior oral agreement isn't valid, and the woman's later agreement is a separate contract.

Looking at the options, option F is about the woman's verbal agreement. Option H is about the written contract being a complete integration. So which is more likely?

If the court rules that the written contract was completely integrated, then the prior oral agreement (about including extra work) isn't part of the contract. So the mechanic didn't have to include the belt for free. Then, when he called and she agreed, that's a new agreement. So the mechanic can charge extra.

Alternatively, if the written contract wasn't specific, the court might find that the belt replacement was part of the servicing and should be included, but that's not the case here because the written contract had specific work listed, I assume. But the facts don't specify whether the written contract was detailed or not.

Wait, the written contract was for $1,000, but the problem doesn't say whether it listed specific services or was more general. If it was specific, then the belt wasn't included, so extra charge applies. If it was general, maybe the belt was included.

But the key point is that the woman agreed to the extra work when the mechanic called. So even if the original contract was ambiguous, the subsequent agreement would allow the extra charge.

So perhaps the court ruled that the woman verbally agreed to the extra work, thus she's liable for the extra $100. That would correspond to option F.

Alternatively, if the written contract was a complete integration, the prior oral agreement isn't valid. Then, the subsequent oral agreement is a separate contract. So the reason would be H.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn here. The fact that the woman agreed when he called seems like a separate agreement. But the original contract's terms would determine whether the belt was included.

Wait, the original written contract's terms: the woman's version is that any additional work was included. The mechanic doesn't remember that. So if the court believes her, then the belt should be included. But if the written contract was completely integrated, her testimony about the oral agreement is inadmissible.

So if the court finds that the written contract was a complete integration (option H), then the oral agreement about including extra work is excluded. Therefore, the belt replacement wasn't part of the original contract, and the mechanic can charge extra, especially since the woman agreed when he called.

Alternatively, the court might find that the written contract wasn't completely integrated, so the oral agreement could be considered, but since the woman later agreed, she's bound anyway.

I think the strongest reasoning is that the written contract was a complete integration, so the prior oral agreement is excluded. Therefore, the mechanic wasn't obliged to include the belt. Then, when he called and she agreed, that's a new agreement. So the court would allow the extra charge because the original contract didn't cover it, and she agreed to the extra work.

So the correct option would be H: The writing was construed as a complete integration of the parties' agreement.

Wait, but option H is about the written contract being a complete integration, which would exclude any prior oral agreements. Then, the subsequent oral agreement (when the woman agreed over the phone) is a separate agreement. So the mechanic can charge for that extra work.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer would be H.
</think>

The question revolves around a written contract between a woman and a mechanic for car servicing, with the woman claiming an oral agreement that any additional work would be included in the $1,000 fee. The mechanic later discovered a worn belt, called the woman for approval to replace it, and charged an extra $100. The woman refused to pay, and the mechanic sued. The court's ruling in favor of the mechanic suggests that the written contract was the final and complete agreement (a complete integration), excluding any prior oral agreements. This means the woman's claim about an oral agreement to include extra work is inadmissible under the parol evidence rule. The subsequent oral agreement—where the woman approved the belt replacement over the phone—constitutes a separate agreement, allowing the mechanic to charge for the extra work. Therefore, the most likely reason for the court's ruling is that the written contract was construed as a complete integration of the parties' agreement.
