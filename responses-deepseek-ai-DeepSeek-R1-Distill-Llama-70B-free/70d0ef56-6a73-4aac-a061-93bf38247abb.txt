Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

An object of mass 100 grams is at rest. A net force of 2000 dynes is applied for 10 seconds. I need to find the final velocity and how far the object moves in those 10 seconds. The options are labeled A to J.

Hmm, right. I remember that when a force is applied, it causes acceleration. Oh wait, Newton's second law says F equals m times a. So F = ma. I can use this to find the acceleration first.

Wait, the mass is given in grams—100 grams. I think I need to convert that into kilograms because standard SI units are kg for mass. Oh wait, no, wait. Newtons are kg·m/s², but in this case, the force is given in dynes. Oh right, dynes are the CGS unit. Let me think—dynes and centimeters and grams. So maybe I should work in CGS units to make it simpler.

Because, in CGS units, acceleration would be in cm/s². Let me make sure. So 1 dyne equals 1 gram·cm/s². So F in dynes equals m (grams) times a (cm/s²). So yeah, that makes sense.

So the force F is 2000 dynes, mass m is 100 grams. So a = F/m. So a = 2000 / 100 = 20 cm/s². Okay, got the acceleration.

Wait, the initial velocity is zero because the object is at rest. So the final velocity after time t can be found with v = u + at. Since u is zero, v = a*t. Let's compute that.

a is 20 cm/s², t is 10 seconds. So 20 * 10 = 200 cm/s. So the final velocity is 200 cm/s. Hmm, that's one of the options. Let me check the options.

Looking through the options, option E is 200 cm/sec and 10 m. Option J is 300 cm/sec and 15 m. So for velocity, E and J have 200 and 300. Hmm, but I'm getting 200 cm/s. So velocity would be 200 cm/s.

Now, the next part is the distance moved in 10 seconds. Since the object starts from rest and accelerates uniformly, I can use the kinematic equation: s = (1/2) a t².

But wait, I'm in CGS units. So a is 20 cm/s², t is 10 seconds.

So s = 0.5 * 20 * (10)^2.

Calculating that: 0.5 *20 =10, 10 squared is 100. So 10 * 100 = 1000 cm. Wait, 1000 cm is 10 meters. Because 100 cm is 1 meter, so 1000 cm is 10 meters.

So the distance is 10 meters. So the velocity is 200 cm/s and the distance is 10 m.

Looking back at the options, option E is exactly that: 200 cm/sec and 10 m. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make any unit conversion mistakes. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, I can solve this using SI units. Let's see if I get the same result.

Mass is 100 grams, which is 0.1 kg. Force is 2000 dynes. 1 dyne equals 0.0001 kg·m/s², or 1e-4 kg m/s². So 2000 dynes is 2000 * 1e-4 kg m/s² = 0.2 kg m/s².

So F=0.2 N. Then a=F/m = 0.2 / 0.1 = 2 m/s².

Then final velocity v = a*t = 2 *10 = 20 m/s. Wait, that's 200 cm/s. Oh yeah, same as before.

Distance: s = 0.5 *a t². So 0.5 *2 *10^2 = 0.5 *2 *100 = 100 meters? Wait wait, wait, no. 10 squared is 100, 0.5 *2 is 1, so 1*100=100 meters? That can't be right because earlier I got 10 meters.

Wait, that's conflicting. Oh wait, no, wait a minute. Because when I calculated in SI units, I got s = 0.5 *2 * (10)^2 = 0.5 *2 *100 = 100 meters. That's way more than the 10 meters I got earlier. There's a discrepancy here. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, no, wait. I think I messed up the calculation in SI units. Let me recalculate.

Wait, in SI units, a = 2 m/s², t=10 s. 

s = 0.5 * a * t² = 0.5 * 2 * (10)^2 = 0.5 *2 *100 = 100 m. But that's 100 meters. But earlier in CGS, I got 10 meters. That's a big difference.

Hmm, that's a problem. Because I'm getting conflicting answers based on the unit system. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, let's check the CGS approach again. In CGS units, a was 20 cm/s². t=10 s.

s = 0.5 *20 * (10)^2 = 0.5 *20 *100 = 10 *100 = 1000 cm, which is 10 meters.

So when I use SI units, I get 100 meters, but when I use CGS, I get 10 meters. That can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in one of the approaches.

Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion for force. Because 2000 dynes is 2000 g·cm/s². So F = ma in CGS units: m in grams, a in cm/s².

But when using SI, F is in Newtons, which is kg·m/s².

So, to convert 2000 dynes to Newtons: since 1 dyne = 1e-5 Newtons (because 1 kg = 1000 g, 1 m=100 cm. So 1 dyne = (1g)(1 cm/s²) = (0.001 kg)(0.01 m/s²) )= 0.00001 kg·m/s² = 1e-5 N.

So 2000 dynes = 2000 *1e-5 N = 0.02 N.

Wait, earlier I said 2000 dynes is 0.2 N, but that's incorrect. Wait:

Wait 1 dyne = 1e-5 N. So 2000 dynes = 2000 *1e-5 = 0.02 N. So F=0.02 N.

Then, mass m is 100 g = 0.1 kg.

So a=F/m = 0.02 /0.1 = 0.2 m/s².

Then, v = a*t = 0.2 *10 = 2 m/s, which is 200 cm/s. That matches the CGS approach.

Then, s = 0.5*a*t² = 0.5 *0.2 * (10)^2 = 0.5 *0.2 *100 = 0.5 *20 =10 meters.

Ah, okay, that makes sense now. Earlier, I incorrectly converted 2000 dynes to 0.2 N, but it's actually 0.02 N. So the SI approach gives the same as CGS: 10 meters.

So the final velocity is 2 m/s (200 cm/s), and the distance is 10 meters. Which matches option E.

Hence, the correct answer is E.

To solve the problem, we start by using Newton's second law, \( F = ma \), where \( F \) is the net force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration. The mass is given as \( 100 \, \text{g} \), and the force is \( 2000 \, \text{dynes} \). In CGS units, \( 1 \, \text{dyne} = 1 \, \text{g·cm/s}^2 \), so the acceleration can be calculated as:

\[
a = \frac{F}{m} = \frac{2000 \, \text{dynes}}{100 \, \text{g}} = 20 \, \text{cm/s}^2.
\]

The object starts from rest (\( u = 0 \)), and the final velocity \( v \) after \( t = 10 \, \text{s} \) is given by:

\[
v = u + at = 0 + 20 \, \text{cm/s}^2 \cdot 10 \, \text{s} = 200 \, \text{cm/s}.
\]

Next, to find the distance traveled, we use the kinematic equation for constant acceleration:

\[
s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2.
\]

Since \( u = 0 \), this simplifies to:

\[
s = \frac{1}{2}at^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 20 \, \text{cm/s}^2 \cdot (10 \, \text{s})^2 = 0.5 \cdot 20 \cdot 100 = 1000 \, \text{cm} = 10 \, \text{m}.
\]

Thus, the final velocity is \( 200 \, \text{cm/s} \), and the distance traveled is \( 10 \, \text{m} \). Comparing these results with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**E: 200 cm/sec and 10 m.**
