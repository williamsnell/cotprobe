Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about sulfurous acid, H2SO3, in an aqueous solution. I'm a bit rusty on my acid-base chemistry, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking about the concentrations of different ions in the solution. The options are A through J, each giving a different order of concentrations for H2SO3, HSO3^-, and SO3^2-.

I remember that sulfurous acid is a diprotic acid, which means it can donate two protons. So it should dissociate in two steps. The first dissociation is when H2SO3 loses a proton to become HSO3^- and H+. The second step is HSO3^- losing another proton to form SO3^2- and another H+.

Wait, but wait. Diprotic acids can be strong or weak in each step. I think sulfurous acid is a weak acid, so both dissociations are incomplete. That means the first step's dissociation is more than the second. So the concentration of H+ from the first step is higher than from the second.

So, in solution, H2SO3 is the undissociated form. When it dissociates, it forms HSO3^- and H+. Then, some of the HSO3^- will further dissociate into SO3^2- and H+.

But since the second dissociation is less than the first, the concentration of HSO3^- should be higher than SO3^2-. Because there's more of the first dissociation happening than the second.

Wait, but wait again. Let me think about the concentrations. The first dissociation step (H2SO3 → H+ + HSO3^-) has an equilibrium. The second step (HSO3^- → H+ + SO3^2-) is another equilibrium. Since the first step is more likely, the concentration of HSO3^- will be higher than that of SO3^2-.

So in the solution, the undissociated H2SO3 is the most concentrated, then HSO3^-, and the least is SO3^2-.

Wait, no. Wait, the first dissociation: the initial H2SO3 is the main component. Once it dissociates, it forms H+ and HSO3^- ions. But because it's a weak acid, the majority of H2SO3 remains undissociated. So [H2SO3] is greater than [HSO3^-]. Then, the second dissociation of HSO3^- is even less, so [SO3^2-] is the smallest.

So the order should be [H2SO3] > [HSO3^-] > [SO3^2-].

Looking at the options, let me see. Option G is [H2SO3] > [HSO3^-] > [SO32-]. So that's the one.

Wait, but wait another thing. Some sources might say that for diprotic acids, if the first dissociation is more, then the first conjugate base is more prevalent than the second. So yes, HSO3^- is more than SO3^2-, and H2SO3 is the highest because it's the undissociated form.

So the correct order is H2SO3 concentration is higher than HSO3^-, which is higher than SO3^2-.

Looking back at the options, option G says [H2SO3] > [HSO3^-] > [SO32-]. That matches what I'm thinking.

So I think the correct answer is G.

Sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃) is a weak diprotic acid, meaning it can donate two protons in two successive dissociation steps. The first dissociation, H₂SO₃ → H⁺ + HSO₃⁻, is more significant than the second dissociation, HSO₃⁻ → H⁺ + SO₃²⁻, because the second step has a smaller equilibrium constant. As a result, the concentration of HSO₃⁻ is greater than that of SO₃²⁻. Additionally, since H₂SO₃ is a weak acid, the majority of it remains undissociated in solution, making [H₂SO₃] the highest concentration among the three species.

Given this, the correct order of concentrations is:

\[
[H_2SO_3] > [HSO_3^-] > [SO_3^{2-}]
\]

This corresponds to option **G**.

Answer: G
