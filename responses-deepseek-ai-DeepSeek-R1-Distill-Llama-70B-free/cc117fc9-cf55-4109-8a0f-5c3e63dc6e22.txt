Okay, so I have this math problem here: 4 ÷ 2 • 2 + 8 − 4. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the order of operations here. I remember that in math problems, especially when there are multiple operations, I need to follow PEMDAS—Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the expression: 4 ÷ 2 • 2 + 8 − 4. There are no parentheses or exponents, so I should start with multiplication and division. Oh wait, but multiplication and division are at the same level in PEMDAS, so I do them from left to right as they appear.

So the first operation is 4 ÷ 2. Let me calculate that. 4 divided by 2 is 2. Now, the expression becomes 2 • 2 + 8 − 4. Next, I move to the multiplication part, which is 2 multiplied by 2. That equals 4. So now the expression is 4 + 8 − 4.

After handling multiplication and division, I move on to addition and subtraction, again from left to right. So first, 4 plus 8 is 12. Then, subtract 4 from that. 12 minus 4 is 8. Wait, but looking at the answer options, 8 is option G. But I think I might have made a mistake because I thought the answer would be higher.

Let me double-check the steps. Starting again:

4 ÷ 2 is 2. Then 2 • 2 is 4. Then 4 + 8 is 12, minus 4 gives 8. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, maybe I misread the original problem. Let me check again: 4 ÷ 2 • 2 + 8 − 4. No, that's what it says. So according to this, the answer would be 8, which is G.

But wait, wait a second. Maybe I'm grouping the operations incorrectly. Let me think about the order again. Oh, perhaps I should consider that division and multiplication are at the same precedence, so I do them left to right. So 4 ÷ 2 is 2, then 2 • 2 is 4. So yes, same result. Then adding 8 and subtracting 4 gives 8. So that would be correct.

Alternatively, sometimes people might interpret it differently, but according to PEMDAS, I think I did it right. So the answer should be 8, which is option G.

The expression to solve is 4 ÷ 2 • 2 + 8 − 4. Following PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right):

1. **Division**: 4 ÷ 2 = 2  
   Expression becomes: 2 • 2 + 8 − 4  

2. **Multiplication**: 2 • 2 = 4  
   Expression becomes: 4 + 8 − 4  

3. **Addition**: 4 + 8 = 12  
   Expression becomes: 12 − 4  

4. **Subtraction**: 12 − 4 = 8  

Thus, the final result is 8. The correct answer is **G**.
