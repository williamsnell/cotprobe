Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about electrochemical cells. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on electrochemistry, but let's see.

The question is about what happens when a cell made of Zn and Cu runs down completely. The cell notation is Zn | Zn²+ || Cu²+ | Cu, and the standard cell potential is 1.10 volts. They're asking about the relative concentrations of Zn²+ and Cu²+ when the cell has fully discharged.

Wait, so when the cell has run down, that means it's reached equilibrium, right? The cell can't produce any more current because the concentrations have adjusted so that the driving force is gone.

I remember that in a galvanic cell, the anode is where oxidation happens, and the cathode is where reduction occurs. Zinc is more reactive than copper, so in this cell, Zn is the anode, and Cu is the cathode.

At the anode (Zn), zinc metal oxidizes to Zn²+ ions and releases electrons. The reaction would be: Zn(s) → Zn²+ (aq) + 2e⁻.

At the cathode (Cu), Cu²+ ions gain electrons and deposit onto the Cu electrode as metallic copper. The reaction is: Cu²+ (aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s).

So, during the operation of the cell, Zn²+ is produced, and Cu²+ is consumed. But wait, until when? The cell stops when the concentrations are such that the cell potential becomes zero. 

Oh right, the cell potential (E) depends on the concentrations of the ions. The Nernst equation comes into play here. The standard cell potential E° is given, but as the cell runs, the concentrations change, altering the actual cell potential E.

The Nernst equation for a cell at 25°C is E = E° - (0.0592/n) log Q, where Q is the reaction quotient. For the cell to stop, E must be zero. So, 0 = E° - (0.0592/n) log Q. Rearranging, log Q = (E° * n) / 0.0592.

Wait, but what's the overall reaction? Let's write that. The oxidation of Zn and reduction of Cu²+ combine to give:

Zn(s) + Cu²+ (aq) → Zn²+ (aq) + Cu(s).

So the reaction quotient Q is [Zn²+]/[Cu²+], because the products are Zn²+ and Cu(s) (which is a solid, so it doesn't appear in Q), and the reactants are Zn(s) (also solid, so not in Q) and Cu²+.

So Q = [Zn²+]/[Cu²+].

Now, substituting into the Nernst equation at equilibrium (E=0):

0 = 1.10 - (0.0592/2) * log([Zn²+]/[Cu²+]).

Multiply both sides by 2/0.0592 to isolate log Q:

log([Zn²+]/[Cu²+]) = (1.10 * 2) / 0.0592.

Calculating that: 1.10 * 2 = 2.20. 2.20 / 0.0592 ≈ 37.17.

So log([Zn²+]/[Cu²+]) = 37.17 → [Zn²+]/[Cu²+] = 10^37.17.

Wait, that's a huge number. So [Zn²+] is much, much larger than [Cu²+]. Because 10^37 is a massive ratio.

So when the cell runs down, the concentration of Zn²+ is far greater than that of Cu²+.

Looking back at the options:

Option G says the concentration of Zn²+ is far greater than Cu²+. That matches our conclusion.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because when the cell runs down, the reaction goes until it can't proceed. So all the Cu²+ would have been used up to make Cu metal, and Zn would have dissolved into Zn²+ as much as possible until the potential drops to zero. So yeah, the Zn²+ would accumulate a lot more.

So the correct answer should be G.
</think>

When the Zn | Zn²+ || Cu²+ | Cu cell has completely run down, it means the cell potential has dropped to zero, and equilibrium has been reached. In this cell, Zn is oxidized at the anode to Zn²+, and Cu²+ is reduced at the cathode to Cu(s). The overall reaction is:

\[
\text{Zn(s)} + \text{Cu}^{2+} \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+} + \text{Cu(s)}.
\]

The Nernst equation is used to determine the equilibrium condition:

\[
E = E^\circ - \frac{0.0592}{n} \log Q,
\]

where \( Q = \frac{[\text{Zn}^{2+}]}{[\text{Cu}^{2+}]} \), \( n = 2 \), and \( E^\circ = 1.10 \, \text{V} \). At equilibrium, \( E = 0 \), so:

\[
0 = 1.10 - \frac{0.0592}{2} \log \left( \frac{[\text{Zn}^{2+}]}{[\text{Cu}^{2+}]} \right).
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\log \left( \frac{[\text{Zn}^{2+}]}{[\text{Cu}^{2+}]} \right) = \frac{1.10 \cdot 2}{0.0592} \approx 37.17.
\]

This gives:

\[
\frac{[\text{Zn}^{2+}]}{[\text{Cu}^{2+}]} = 10^{37.17}.
\]

This extremely large ratio indicates that the concentration of Zn²+ is far greater than that of Cu²+ at equilibrium. This occurs because the cell operation produces Zn²+ and consumes Cu²+, continuing until the concentrations reach this equilibrium ratio.

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**G: The concentration of Zn²+ is far greater than Cu²+.**
