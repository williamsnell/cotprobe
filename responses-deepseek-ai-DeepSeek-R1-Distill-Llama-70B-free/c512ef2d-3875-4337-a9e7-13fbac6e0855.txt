Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about heat transfer by radiation in a thermos bottle. Hmm, I remember that heat transfer through radiation involves some formulas. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law maybe? Yeah, that's the one which says the power radiated is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature, but also involves emissivity.

Wait, the question is about the factor by which the heat transfer increases when the reflectance changes. Reflectance... right, reflectance (ρ) is the same as emissivity but emissivity is emissive, so emissivity (ε) is 1 - ρ. Oh wait no, emissivity is the ability to emit radiation, while reflectance is the ability to reflect. So I think they are related by ε = 1 - ρ, but I'm not 100% sure. Oh wait, no, that's for metals maybe. For non-conductors, emissivity equals absorptivity, but for metals, emissivity is lower. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think.

The formula for the net rate of heat transfer by radiation between two surfaces is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, considering emissivity and reflectance. Oh wait, when two surfaces are facing each other, the heat transfer depends on their emissivities. If each wall has a certain emissivity, the net radiation heat transfer can be calculated.

Wait, the formula might be something like Q = (σ A (T1^4 - T2^4)) / ( (1/ε1) + (1/ε2) - 1 ) or something like that. Or maybe when the two surfaces are similar, like in a thermos where the walls are similar, perhaps it's a different approach.

Alternatively, I've heard about the concept of emissivity and how it affects heat transfer. If the walls are more reflective, they emit less radiation. So the emissivity is lower when reflectance is higher because emissivity ε = 1 - ρ. So if the reflectance decreases, emissivity increases, leading to more heat transfer.

Wait, the problem states that each wall's reflectance is reduced from 0.9 to 0.3. So initially, the reflectance ρ was 0.9, so emissivity ε_initial = 1 - 0.9 = 0.1. Then, when ρ drops to 0.3, ε_final = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

But wait, the thermos probably has two walls (like an inner and outer wall) facing each other. So each wall's emissivity is ε. So the heat transfer between them would depend on both ε1 and ε2. But since both are the same, ε1 = ε2 = ε.

I think the formula for the net radiation heat transfer between two surfaces is Q = (σ A (T1^4 - T2^4)) / ( (1/ε1) + (1/ε2) - 1 ). Or wait, maybe it's 1/(ε1) + 1/(ε2) - 1 in the denominator. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Alternatively, when two surfaces are each other's only exchange partners, the formula might simplify.

Wait, wait. Another approach: the heat transfer coefficient for radiation is given by (ε σ (T1^2 + T2^2)(T1 + T2)) ). But perhaps that's not the right approach here.

Alternatively, for two parallel surfaces facing each other, the effective emissivity is given by 1/( (1/ε1) + (1/ε2) ) - 1. No, wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula for the heat transfer rate between two surfaces is Q = (σ A (T1^4 - T2^4)) / ( (1 - ε1) + (1 - ε2) + (ε1 ε2)/(1 - ε1 - ε2 + ε1 ε2) )) Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's easier to approach this using the concept that each surface's emissivity affects the total heat transfer.

Wait, another approach: the emissivity of each surface affects how much they emit. The total heat transfer would be the sum of the heat emitted by each surface minus the heat reflected back. Or maybe it's better to model each surface's contribution.

Wait, let's think about when two surfaces are facing each other. The heat leaving surface 1 is ε1 σ T1^4, but some of that is reflected back by surface 2. Similarly, surface 2 emits ε2 σ T2^4, and some is reflected by surface 1.

Wait, the net heat transfer from surface 1 to surface 2 would be:

Q = (ε1 ε2 σ A (T1^4 - T2^4)) / (1 - ε1 ε2)

Wait, no, that doesn't sound quite right. Alternatively, the net heat transfer can be modeled as:

The heat emitted by surface 1 is ε1 σ T1^4. Surface 2 reflects a fraction ρ2 = (1 - ε2) of that. So the heat absorbed by surface 2 from surface 1 is ε1 * ε2 σ T1^4. Similarly, surface 2 emits ε2 σ T2^4, and surface 1 absorbs ε2 * ε1 σ T2^4.

Wait, but wait: the net heat transfer from 1 to 2 would be the heat emitted by 1 that's absorbed by 2 minus the heat emitted by 2 that's absorbed by 1. So Q = A σ (ε1 ε2 (T1^4 - T2^4)).

Hmm, but perhaps that's not the exact formula. Alternatively, the formula could be Q = (σ A (T1^4 - T2^4) * ε1 ε2) / (1 - ε1 ε2) ). No, maybe that's not right either.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that the heat transfer between two surfaces is given by the formula Q = (σ A (T1^4 - T2^4)) / (1/ε1 + 1/ε2 - 1). I remember seeing something like this before. So if ε1 and ε2 are the emissivities of the two surfaces, then the denominator is (1/ε1 + 1/ε2 - 1).

So, in this problem, both walls have the same emissivity ε. So ε1 = ε2 = ε. So the formula becomes Q = (σ A (ΔT^4)) / (2/ε - 1) )

Wait, but the problem states that the walls' reflectance is reduced from 0.9 to 0.3. So initially, each ε was 0.1, and then becomes 0.7.

So the initial Q_initial is (σ A ΔT^4) / (2/(0.1) - 1) ) = (σ A ΔT^4) / (20 - 1 ) = (σ A ΔT^4) /19

The final Q_final is (σ A ΔT^4) / (2/(0.7) -1 ) = (σ A ΔT^4) / ( approx 2.857 -1 ) = (σ A ΔT^4) /1.857

Wait, but wait, 2/0.7 is approximately 2.857. So denominator is 2.857 -1 = 1.857.

So the factor by which Q increases is Q_final / Q_initial.

So that's ( (1/1.857) ) / (1/19) ) = (19) / 1.857 ≈ let's calculate that.

19 divided by 1.857. Let me compute: 1.857 times 10 is 18.57, which is just under 19. So 1.857 * 10.2 ≈ 19. So 19 / 1.857 ≈ about 10.23.

Wait, but let me compute it accurately.

1.857 times 10 is 18.57. 19 - 18.57 = 0.43. 0.43 / 1.857 = approximately 0.2315. So total is 10 + 0.2315 ≈ 10.2315.

Looking back at the options, option G is 10.2, which is close. So the factor is approximately 10.2.

Wait, but wait another moment. Did I get the formula right? Because sometimes the formula for two surfaces facing each other can be written as Q = σ A (T1^4 - T2^4) * (ε1 ε2) / (1 - ε1 ε2) ). Wait, is that another possible formula?

If that's the case, then Q_initial would be (σ A (ΔT^4) ) * (ε1 ε2) / (1 - ε1 ε2 )

Since ε1 = ε2 = 0.1 initially, ε1 ε2 = 0.01.

So Q_initial = σ A ΔT^4 * 0.01 / (1 - 0.01) = 0.01/0.99 * σ A ΔT^4 ≈ 0.010101 σ A ΔT^4.

After the change, ε1 = ε2 = 0.7, so ε1 ε2 = 0.49.

Q_final = σ A ΔT^4 * 0.49 / (1 - 0.49) ) = 0.49 / 0.51 ≈ 0.9608 σ A ΔT^4.

So the factor is Q_final/Q_initial = (0.9608) / (0.010101) ≈ 95.16. That's way higher than any of the options given. So that can't be right. So perhaps this formula isn't the correct one.

Hmm, maybe I should stick to the first formula I had. So using the first approach, the factor was about 10.2, which is option G.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Q = (σ A (T1^4 - T2^4 )) * (ε) / (2 - ε), where ε is the emissivity of both surfaces. Wait, that's possible. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: for two very large plates facing each other, the net heat transfer can be modeled as Q = (ε σ A (T1^4 - T2^4 )) / (2 - ε )^2. I'm not sure. I think I might be getting mixed up with different formulas.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Q = (σ A (T1^4 - T2^4 )) * (ε1 ε2) / (1 - ε1 ε2). Wait, that's another possibility. Let me test that.

So initially, ε1 = ε2 = 0.1. So ε1 ε2 = 0.01. Then Q_initial = σ A (ΔT^4) * 0.01 / (1 - 0.01) ) = 0.01/0.99 * σ A ΔT^4 ≈ 0.0101 σ A ΔT^4.

After change, ε1 = ε2 = 0.7. So ε1 ε2 = 0.49. Then Q_final = σ A (ΔT^4) * 0.49 / (1 - 0.49) ) = 0.49/0.51 * σ A ΔT^4 ≈ 0.9608 σ A ΔT^4.

So the factor is (0.9608)/(0.0101) ≈ 95.13. Again, this gives a factor way beyond the given options, which only go up to about 15.4. So that can't be correct.

Hmm, perhaps I'm using the wrong approach. Let me think again. Maybe the formula is simpler. The rate of heat transfer by radiation between two surfaces is proportional to the emissivity of each surface and inversely proportional to (2 - ε_avg), or something.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is that the heat transfer is inversely proportional to (1/ε1 + 1/ε2 - 1). So Q is proportional to 1/(1/ε1 + 1/ε2 -1 ). Since both ε1 and ε2 are the same, let's say ε, then it's 1/(2/ε -1 ). 

So initially, ε = 0.1. So denominator is 2/0.1 -1 = 20 -1 =19. So Q_initial ∝ 1/19.

After the change, ε becomes 0.7. Denominator is 2/0.7 -1 ≈ 2.857 -1 = 1.857. So Q_final ∝ 1/1.857.

The factor is (1/1.857) / (1/19) ) = 19/1.857 ≈ 10.23.

That's matching what I got earlier, and option G is 10.2. So this must be the correct approach.

Therefore, the answer should be G: 10.2.

To determine the factor by which the heat transfer by radiation increases when the reflectance of each wall of a thermos bottle is reduced from 0.9 to 0.3, we start by relating reflectance (ρ) to emissivity (ε). The relationship is given by:

\[
\varepsilon = 1 - \rho
\]

Initially, when \(\rho = 0.9\), the emissivity is:

\[
\varepsilon_{\text{initial}} = 1 - 0.9 = 0.1
\]

After the reflectance is reduced to \(\rho = 0.3\), the emissivity becomes:

\[
\varepsilon_{\text{final}} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7
\]

The heat transfer by radiation between two surfaces is proportional to the emissivity of the surfaces and can be modeled using the formula:

\[
Q \propto \frac{1}{\frac{1}{\varepsilon_1} + \frac{1}{\varepsilon_2} - 1}
\]

Since both walls of the thermos have the same emissivity (\(\varepsilon_1 = \varepsilon_2 = \varepsilon\)), the formula simplifies to:

\[
Q \propto \frac{1}{\frac{2}{\varepsilon} - 1}
\]

### Initial Heat Transfer (\(Q_{\text{initial}}\)):
Substituting \(\varepsilon_{\text{initial}} = 0.1\):

\[
Q_{\text{initial}} \propto \frac{1}{\frac{2}{0.1} - 1} = \frac{1}{20 - 1} = \frac{1}{19}
\]

### Final Heat Transfer (\(Q_{\text{final}}\)):
Substituting \(\varepsilon_{\text{final}} = 0.7\):

\[
Q_{\text{final}} \propto \frac{1}{\frac{2}{0.7} - 1} = \frac{1}{2.857 - 1} = \frac{1}{1.857}
\]

### Factor of Increase:
The factor by which the heat transfer increases is the ratio of \(Q_{\text{final}}\) to \(Q_{\text{initial}}\):

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{Q_{\text{final}}}{Q_{\text{initial}}} = \frac{\frac{1}{1.857}}{\frac{1}{19}} = \frac{19}{1.857} \approx 10.23
\]

### Closest Option:
The closest value to 10.23 among the given options is **10.2**, which corresponds to **Option G**.
