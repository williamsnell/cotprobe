Question:

Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how many times a clock chimes between 5:10 and 7:35 PM. Hmm, the clock chimes in two scenarios: every hour, the same number of times as the hour, and once for every 15-minute increment between hours. So I have to consider both the hourly chimes and the quarter-hour chimes.

Wait, the time frame is from 5:10 to 7:35. So I should break this down into each hour and the quarters in between.

First, the clock chimes on the hour. Let's list the hours between 5:10 and 7:35. Well, the next hour after 5:10 is 6 PM, then 7 PM, and the next would be 8 PM, but since we're stopping at 7:35, we don't reach 8 PM. So the on-the-hour chimes occur at 6 PM and 7 PM.

At 6 PM, it chimes 6 times. At 7 PM, it chimes 7 times. So that's 6 +7=13 chimes from the hours.

Wait, but what about 5 PM? Because 5:10 is just after 5 PM. So does the 5 PM chime count? Oh, no, because the clock only chimes on the hour. Since we're starting at 5:10, the 5 PM chime has already happened, so we don't include it.

Now for the 15-minute increments. The clock chimes once each at :15, :30, :45, and :00 of each hour. Wait, but :00 is the top of the hour, which we already counted as the hourly chime. So I think the quarter chimes are at :15, :30, and :45.

So for each hour, there are three quarter chimes.

But wait, let's think about the start and end times. From 5:10 PM to 7:35 PM. So we need to count the 15-minute marks that fall within this period.

Let's break it down hour by hour:

Starting at 5:10 PM. The next quarter is 5:15, then 5:30, 5:45. Then in the next hour (6 PM), the quarters are at 6:15, 6:30, 6:45. Then at 7 PM, the quarters would be 7:15, 7:30, but 7:35 is the end, so 7:45 isn't counted. Wait, but 7:45 is after 7:35, so we don't include it.

Wait, but the period is up to 7:35, so 7:30 is included (7:30 is before 7:35), but 7:45 is after. So for each hour, how many quarters are included?

Looking at each hour:

1. 5 PM hour: from 5:10 to 5:59:59.

The 15-minute marks here are 5:15, 5:30, 5:45. All three are after 5:10, so they are included. So 3 chimes.

2. 6 PM hour: from 6:00 to 6:59:59.

The 15-minute marks are 6:15, 6:30, 6:45. All within the period, so 3 chimes.

3. 7 PM hour: from 7:00 to 7:35.

The 15-minute marks here would be 7:15, 7:30. Because 7:45 is beyond 7:35, so only two chimes here.

Wait, but wait. The initial and end times: the period is from 5:10 to 7:35. So 5:15 is within, yes. 7:35 is the end, so 7:30 is included, 7:45 is not. So in 7 PM hour, only two quarter chimes.

So total quarter chimes: 3 (5 PM) +3 (6 PM) +2 (7 PM) = 8.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. From 5:10 to 7:35.

So for the 5 PM hour, starting at 5:10, the chimes are at 5:15, 5:30, 5:45. So yes, three.

6 PM hour: 6:15, 6:30, 6:45. All are before 7:35, so three.

7 PM hour: 7:15, 7:30. Because 7:45 is after 7:35. So two.

So 3+3+2=8 quarter chimes.

And the on-the-hour chimes at 6 PM (6 chimes) and 7 PM (7 chimes) total 13.

So total chimes would be 13 +8=21.

Wait, but wait, let me recount. Because the on-the-hour chimes happen at 6 PM and 7 PM. So that's 6+7=13.

The quarter chimes: 3 (5 PM) +3 (6 PM) +2 (7 PM) =8.

So total 13+8=21.

Looking at the options, option G is 21.

To determine the total number of chimes between 5:10 and 7:35 P.M., we need to account for both the hourly chimes and the quarter-hour chimes.

### Hourly Chimes:
- At **6 P.M.**, the clock chimes **6 times**.
- At **7 P.M.**, the clock chimes **7 times**.
- Total hourly chimes = \(6 + 7 = 13\).

### Quarter-Hour Chimes:
The clock chimes once at each 15-minute increment (:15, :30, :45). We analyze each hour within the given time frame:

1. **5 P.M. hour (5:10 to 5:59):**
   - Chimes at 5:15, 5:30, and 5:45.
   - Total = \(3\) chimes.

2. **6 P.M. hour (6:00 to 6:59):**
   - Chimes at 6:15, 6:30, and 6:45.
   - Total = \(3\) chimes.

3. **7 P.M. hour (7:00 to 7:35):**
   - Chimes at 7:15 and 7:30 (7:45 is after 7:35 and not included).
   - Total = \(2\) chimes.

- Total quarter-hour chimes = \(3 + 3 + 2 = 8\).

### Total Chimes:
- Hourly chimes + Quarter-hour chimes = \(13 + 8 = 21\).

Thus, the total number of chimes between 5:10 and 7:35 P.M. is **21**.
