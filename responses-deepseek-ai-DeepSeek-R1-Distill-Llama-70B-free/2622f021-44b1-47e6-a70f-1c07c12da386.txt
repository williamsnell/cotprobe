Okay, so I've got this NMR question here. Let me think about it. Hmm, the question is about calculating the linewidth based on the T2 value. I remember that in NMR, the linewidth is related to the relaxation time T2. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Oh right, I think the formula is something like linewidth (Δν) equals 1 divided by T2 times a constant factor. Wait, but wait, I might be mixing up T1 and T2. No, T2 is the spin-spin relaxation time, which affects the linewidth. Oh, right, the relationship is Δν = 1/(2π T2). Or is it 1/(π T2)? Wait, no, wait. Let me recall: the natural linewidth comes from the uncertainty principle, and the formula is Δν = (1/(2π)) * (1/T2). Or is that from T2*? Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think again. The line width in NMR is given by the equation Δν = 1/(π T2), but I'm not entirely sure. Or is it 1/(2π T2)? Wait, I think I'm mixing up the conversion between radians and units. Oh wait, in the context of NMR, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) is given by the relation Δν = 1/(π T2). Or wait, no—some sources say that the linewidth is (1/(2π)) * (1/T2), but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, I remember that the energy-time uncertainty principle says ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here. Alternatively, the relation between the relaxation time and the line width is given by Δν = 1/(2π T2). Oh wait, I think that's correct. Because T2 is the relaxation time, which is the inverse of the linewidth in terms of frequency.

Wait, but I'm getting mixed up. Let me think of the units. T2 is in seconds, and the linewidth is in Hz (which is 1/seconds). So the formula must be something like Δν = 1/(some factor) * (1/T2).

So, if T2 is given in seconds, then 1/T2 would give Hz (since 1/s is Hz). But wait, no, T2 is in seconds, so 1/(T2) would be in 1/s, which is Hz. But is there a factor like π or 2π involved?

I think the correct formula is Δν = (1/(2π)) * (1/T2). Because the line width is inversely proportional to T2, and considering the Fourier transform relationship. Because T2 is the time constant for the decay of the signal, and the frequency domain (linewidth) would be the inverse in terms of Fourier transform. Oh right, in Lorentzian lineshape, the FWHM is given by 2Δν, where Δν is the half width at half maximum. Wait, no, wait.

Wait, the Lorentzian line shape has a peak height proportional to 1/Δν squared, and the width at half height is Δν. So the FWHM is Δν. And the relation to T2 is Δν = 1/(π T2). Or is it 1/(2π T2)? Hmm.

Wait, I found conflicting information in my notes. Let me think. In NMR, the relation between the transverse relaxation time T2 and the linewidth is Δν = 1/(π T2). Or is it 1/(2π T2)? I'm getting myself confused.

Wait, another approach. The time domain signal is an exponential decay with time constant T2. The Fourier transform of an exponential decay is a Lorentzian. The width of the Lorentzian is related to the time constant. The FWHM in the frequency domain (the linewidth) is 2/(T2). But wait, no, because the Fourier transform pairs the exponential decay e^(-t/T2) with a Lorentzian of width 1/(T2) in angular frequency (ω). So converting to frequency (ν), we have ω=2πν, so ν = ω/(2π). So the width in ν would be 1/(2π T2).

Ah, that makes sense. So the FWHM of the line is 1/(π T2) because in terms of angular frequency, it's 2/(T2), but when converted to frequency ν, it's (2/(T2))/(2π) )= 1/(π T2). Wait, no, wait. Let's take it step by step.

The FWHM in the frequency domain is given by the relation:

Δν = 1/(π T2)

Wait, that's what I thought earlier. Alternatively, some sources say Δν = 1/(2π T2). Hmm. Maybe I should look for an example.

Wait, if T2 is 1 second, then 1/(2π) is about 0.159 Hz. So the linewidth would be about 0.159 Hz. Does that make sense? Because a longer T2 means a narrower line.

Wait, in the problem, T2 is 15 ms, which is 0.015 seconds. So using the formula Δν = 1/(2π T2), that would be 1/(2 * π * 0.015) = 1/(0.0942) ≈ 10.61 Hz. But looking at the options, let's see. Option H is 66.7 Hz, which is 1/(0.015) * (1/(2π)) * something. Wait, let me compute that.

Wait, wait, 1/(2π * 0.015) = 1/(0.0942) ≈ 10.61 Hz. But none of the options seem to match that exactly. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: 30.1 Hz

B: 0.0471 Hz

C:42.4 Hz

D:100.1 Hz

E:84.8 Hz

F:52.8 Hz

G:21.2 Hz

H:66.7 Hz

I:15.7 Hz

J:10.5 Hz

Wait, 10.61 is close to option J (10.5 Hz), but why isn't that an option? Or perhaps I have the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Δν = 1/(π T2). So for T2=15 ms=0.015 s,

Δν=1/(π * 0.015) ≈ 1/(0.0471) ≈ 21.2 Hz. Hmm, option G is 21.2 Hz. That seems plausible.

Wait, which is correct? Let me think again. The FWHM in the Lorentzian line is given by Δν = 1/(π T2). Or is it 1/(2π T2)?

Wait, another thought. The relation between T2 and the linewidth is given by Δν = (1/π) * (1/T2). That would be when T2 is in seconds and Δν in Hz.

So for T2=15 ms=0.015 s,

Δν ≈ 1/(3.1416 * 0.015) ≈ 1/(0.0471) ≈ 21.2 Hz.

Which matches option G. But earlier, I thought it might be 1/(2π T2), which would be about 10.6 Hz, but that's not one of the options. So perhaps I was mistaken earlier.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the formula. From what I remember, the relation is Δν = 1/(π T2). Because when T2 is measured in seconds, and you compute 1/(π T2), you get Hz.

Wait, let's think with another example. Suppose T2 is 1 second. Then 1/(π *1)≈0.318 Hz. So the linewidth would be about 0.318 Hz. That seems reasonable. If T2 is shorter, like 0.1 s (100 ms), then Δν≈3.18 Hz. So that makes sense.

Wait, another way: The time-energy uncertainty says ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2. But ΔE is related to the frequency via E=h ν. So ΔE= h Δν. Δt is the relaxation time, which is T2. So,

h Δν * T2 ≈ ħ/2

But ħ = h/(2π), so substituting:

h Δν * T2 ≈ h/(2π * 2)

Cancel h from both sides:

Δν * T2 ≈ 1/(4 π )

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2.

Wait, ΔE is the energy uncertainty, which is related to the linewidth. Let's say ΔE = ħ ω, where ω is the angular frequency (2π ν). And Δt is the relaxation time, which is T2.

So ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ ω * T2 ≈ ħ (since ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2).

Wait, I'm getting myself more confused. Maybe it's better to rely on the formula I thought before.

So, if the formula is Δν = 1/(π T2), then for T2=15 ms=0.015 s,

Δν=1/(π * 0.015) ≈ 21.2 Hz, which is option G.

Alternatively, if the formula is Δν=1/(2π T2), then 1/(2π *0.015)=approx 10.61 Hz. But that's not one of the options. So perhaps the correct formula is 1/(π T2).

Wait, but looking online (if I could), I remember that the correct relation is Δν = 1/(π T2). Or wait, no, in the notes I have, the formula is Δν = (1/π) * (1/T2). For example, when T2 is in seconds, you get Hz.

So, in this problem, 15 ms is 0.015 s.

Δν = 1/(3.1416 * 0.015) ≈ 1/0.0471 ≈ 21.2 Hz.

Which is option G.

So the correct answer should be G:21.2 Hz.
</think>

The linewidth in NMR is related to the spin-spin relaxation time \( T_2 \) by the formula:

\[
\Delta \nu = \frac{1}{\pi T_2}
\]

Here, \( T_2 \) is given as 15 ms, which is equivalent to \( 0.015 \, \text{s} \). Substituting this value into the formula:

\[
\Delta \nu = \frac{1}{\pi \cdot 0.015} \approx \frac{1}{0.0471} \approx 21.2 \, \text{Hz}
\]

This matches option **G: 21.2 Hz**. The other options are inconsistent with the correct formula or the given \( T_2 \) value. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**G: 21.2 Hz**
