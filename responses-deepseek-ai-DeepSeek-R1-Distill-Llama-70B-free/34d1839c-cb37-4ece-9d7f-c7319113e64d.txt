Okay, so I have this physics problem here about interference patterns from two slits. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The problem says there are two narrow slits separated by 0.10 mm, and they're illuminated by light with a wavelength of 600 nm. I need to find the angular position of the first maximum and then the distance between the central maximum and the first maximum on a detector 2.00 meters away.

Wait, I remember that for double-slit interference, the formula is d sin(theta) = m lambda, where d is the slit separation, theta is the angle, m is the order of the maximum, and lambda is the wavelength. Right, because when the path difference between the two slits is an integer multiple of the wavelength, you get constructive interference, which means a bright spot or maximum.

So for the first maximum, m would be 1. Let me plug in the numbers. The slit separation d is 0.10 mm, which I should convert to meters because the wavelength is in nanometers. Oh wait, let me make all units consistent. 0.10 mm is 1.0e-4 meters (since 1 mm is 1e-3 m, so 0.1 mm is 1e-4 m). The wavelength lambda is 600 nm, which is 600e-9 meters.

So the equation becomes: (1e-4 m) * sin(theta) = 1 * 600e-9 m. I need to solve for sin(theta). Let's rearrange that: sin(theta) = (600e-9) / (1e-4). Let me compute that.

600e-9 is 6e-7. Dividing by 1e-4 gives 6e-3, which is 0.006. So sin(theta) = 0.006. Now I need to find theta. Taking the inverse sine, theta ≈ sin⁻¹(0.006). Since 0.006 is a small angle, I can approximate using the small-angle formula where sin(theta) ≈ theta in radians.

So theta ≈ 0.006 radians. To convert that into degrees, since 1 radian is about 57.3 degrees, 0.006 * 57.3 ≈ 0.344 degrees. But wait, the question asks for the angular position, so maybe they just want it in radians or in terms of the formula. Alternatively, perhaps I don't need to compute the angle numerically because the second part of the question is about the distance on the detector.

The next part is the distance between the central maximum and the first maximum on a detector 2 meters away. I think this is where the formula y = L tan(theta) comes into play, where y is the distance from the central maximum, L is the distance to the screen, and theta is the angle we found.

But wait, when theta is small, tan(theta) is approximately equal to sin(theta), which we already have as 0.006. So y ≈ L * theta (since tan(theta) ≈ theta in radians for small angles).

So y = 2.00 m * 0.006 rad = 0.012 meters. Wait, 0.012 meters is 12 millimeters. Oh, so the distance is 12 mm.

Looking at the options, option F is 12 mm. So the answer should be F.

Wait a minute, but let me double-check the calculations. Did I get the units right?

d = 0.10 mm = 1.0e-4 m, correct. lambda = 600e-9 m, correct. So d sin(theta) = m lambda: 1e-4 * sin(theta) = 600e-9. So sin(theta) is 600e-9 / 1e-4 = 6e-3. Yes, 0.006. So the angle is about 0.006 radians.

Then y = L tan(theta) ≈ L theta because theta is small. L is 2 m, so 2 * 0.006 = 0.012 m = 12 mm. Yep, that makes sense.

So the first maximum is at 12 mm from the center. So the correct answer is F.

To determine the angular position of the first maximum in the interference pattern and the distance between the central maximum and the first maximum on a detector, we use the double-slit interference formula:

\[
d \sin(\theta) = m \lambda
\]

Here:
- \(d = 0.10 \, \text{mm} = 1.0 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m}\) (slit separation),
- \(\lambda = 600 \, \text{nm} = 600 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}\) (wavelength),
- \(m = 1\) (first maximum).

Rearranging for \(\sin(\theta)\):
\[
\sin(\theta) = \frac{m \lambda}{d} = \frac{600 \times 10^{-9}}{1.0 \times 10^{-4}} = 6 \times 10^{-3} = 0.006
\]

For small angles, \(\sin(\theta) \approx \tan(\theta) \approx \theta\) (in radians). Thus, \(\theta \approx 0.006 \, \text{rad}\).

Next, to find the distance \(y\) between the central maximum and the first maximum on a detector located \(L = 2.00 \, \text{m}\) away, we use:
\[
y = L \tan(\theta) \approx L \theta
\]

Substituting:
\[
y = 2.00 \, \text{m} \times 0.006 \, \text{rad} = 0.012 \, \text{m} = 12 \, \text{mm}
\]

Thus, the distance between the central maximum and the first maximum is \(12 \, \text{mm}\).

The correct answer is **F: 12 mm**.
