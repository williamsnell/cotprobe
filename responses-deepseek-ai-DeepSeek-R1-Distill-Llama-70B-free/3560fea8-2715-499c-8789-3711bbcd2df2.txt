Okay, so I've got this question about an experiment with an ideal gas. The question is about plotting data where temperature is the independent variable and volume is the dependent variable. I need to figure out what the slope and y-intercept of the graph represent.

Hmm, I remember the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. Since we're dealing with temperature and volume, I should probably rearrange this equation to see the relationship between V and T.

Let me see, if I solve for V, the equation becomes V = (nR/P) * T. So that's in the form of V = m*T + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.

Wait, in this case, the equation is V = (nR/P) * T + 0. Because when T is zero, V would be zero too, right? So the graph should be a straight line passing through the origin, meaning the y-intercept is zero.

So the slope m is nR divided by P. Since R is a constant, the slope is proportional to n/R, but wait, wait. Wait, the slope is (nR)/P. So that would mean the slope is proportional to 1/P. Because n and R are constants in this case, assuming the amount of gas doesn't change and we're talking about the same gas (so n is fixed).

So the slope is inversely proportional to the pressure of the gas. Because if P increases, the slope decreases, and vice versa.

Now, looking at the options. Let's go through them.

Option A: Slope proportional to pressure, intercept 0. No, because our slope is inversely proportional to P, not directly.

Option B: Slope inversely proportional to volume. Wait, no, the slope's relation is with pressure, not volume. So B is out.

Option C: Slope inversely proportional to P, intercept not zero. But earlier I thought intercept is zero because when T is zero, V is zero. So C's intercept part is wrong.

Option F: Slope inversely proportional to P, intercept 0. That fits with what I thought. Let me check the others.

Option E: Slope proportional to P, which is wrong.

Option D: Slope proportional to V, incorrect.

So the correct option is F. Because slope is inversely proportional to pressure and the intercept is zero.

The experiment involves an ideal gas where temperature (in K) is the independent variable and volume (in m³) is the dependent variable. Using the ideal gas law, \( PV = nRT \), and solving for \( V \), we get:

\[
V = \frac{nR}{P}T
\]

This equation is in the form \( V = mT + b \), where \( m \) is the slope and \( b \) is the y-intercept. Here, the slope \( m \) is \( \frac{nR}{P} \), meaning the slope is **inversely proportional to the pressure** (\( P \)) of the gas. Additionally, when \( T = 0 \), \( V = 0 \), so the y-intercept \( b \) is **0 m³**.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The slope is inversely proportional to pressure, not directly proportional.  
- **B**: Incorrect. The slope is related to pressure, not volume.  
- **C**: Incorrect. While the slope is inversely proportional to pressure, the intercept is 0, not non-zero.  
- **D**: Incorrect. The slope is not proportional to volume.  
- **E**: Incorrect. The slope is not proportional to pressure.  
- **F**: Correct. The slope is inversely proportional to pressure, and the intercept is 0.  
- **G**: Incorrect. The slope is related to pressure, not volume, and the intercept is 0.  
- **H**: Incorrect. The slope is not zero, and the intercept is not equal to pressure.  
- **I**: Incorrect. The slope is not equal to pressure, and the intercept is not equal to volume.  
- **J**: Incorrect. The slope is not proportional to volume, and the intercept is 0.

The correct answer is **F**: The slope will be inversely proportional to the pressure of the gas and the intercept will be 0 m³.

Answer: F
