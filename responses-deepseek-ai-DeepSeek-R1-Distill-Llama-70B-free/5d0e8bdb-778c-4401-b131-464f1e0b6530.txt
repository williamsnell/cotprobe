Okay, so I've got this question here about demonstrating that amino acids are used to build proteins in cells, while the existing proteins are used in catabolism. Hmm, I need to figure out which technique would show that. Let's break it down.

The question is asking about showing the use of amino acids for protein synthesis and proteins being broken down in catabolism. So, I'm thinking about methods that can track where amino acids go in the cell.

I remember that autoradiography involves using radioactive isotopes. If you label amino acids with a radioactive tracer, like 14C or 3H, you can track their incorporation into proteins over time. When the cell uses these amino acids to build proteins, the proteins would become radioactive. Then, by using autoradiography, you can detect where that radioactivity is in the cell. So, new proteins would show up as radioactive spots, showing that amino acids are being used for synthesis.

Now, for catabolism—proteins being broken down. If the existing proteins in the cell are labeled, maybe using a different isotope or a pulse-chase experiment, then you could track their breakdown. But wait, the question is about demonstrating both processes. So, maybe the same method applies. If you see the proteins being broken down (catabolism), that's another part.

Looking at the options, option E is Autoradiography. Other options: ELISA is for detecting specific proteins using antibodies. PCR is for DNA amplification. X-ray crystallography is for determining protein structures. Mass spectrometry identifies proteins based on mass. Western blotting detects specific proteins too. Microscopy is for imaging cells. Chromatography separates molecules. FISH is for DNA or RNA in cells. Spectroscopy is for chemical analysis.

So, autoradiography seems the best fit because it can show the incorporation of labeled amino acids into new proteins. If you see the radioactivity in the proteins, it shows they've been synthesized. And if proteins are being broken down, maybe their label would appear in other places, like in amino acid pools or excreted. Alternatively, you could do a pulse-chase experiment where you first label the amino acids (pulse) and then see over time (chase) how the proteins are made and maybe broken down.

Wait, but how does this show catabolism? Maybe by seeing the decrease in labeled proteins over time, indicating they're being broken down. Or perhaps using different labels for existing proteins. But regardless, autoradiography can track the movement and incorporation of amino acids into proteins, demonstrating their role in building them. So I think E is the right answer.

To demonstrate that amino acids are used to build proteins in cells, while the proteins already present are used in catabolism, the most appropriate technique is autoradiography. This method involves labeling amino acids with a radioactive isotope, such as ¹⁴C or ³H, and tracking their incorporation into proteins over time. Autoradiography can detect the radioactivity in newly synthesized proteins, showing that amino acids are being used for protein synthesis. Additionally, by observing changes in the labeled proteins over time, such as their breakdown or disappearance, autoradiography can also provide insights into catabolism, where existing proteins are degraded.

Among the options provided:

- **A: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)** is used to detect specific proteins using antibodies, not for tracking amino acid incorporation.
- **B: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)** is for DNA amplification and unrelated to protein synthesis or catabolism.
- **C: X-ray crystallography** determines protein structures, not their synthesis or breakdown.
- **D: Mass spectrometry** identifies proteins based on their mass but does not track amino acid incorporation.
- **E: Autoradiography** is the correct choice, as it can track the fate of labeled amino acids and proteins.
- **F: Western blotting** detects specific proteins but does not track their synthesis or breakdown dynamically.
- **G: Microscopy** is for imaging cells and does not directly demonstrate protein synthesis or catabolism.
- **H: Chromatography** separates molecules but does not track amino acid incorporation into proteins.
- **I: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)** is used for detecting DNA or RNA, not proteins.
- **J: Spectroscopy** is for chemical analysis and does not directly demonstrate protein synthesis or catabolism.

Thus, autoradiography is the most suitable technique for this purpose.
