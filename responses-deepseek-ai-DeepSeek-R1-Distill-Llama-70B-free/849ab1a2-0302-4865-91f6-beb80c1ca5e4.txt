Okay, so I've got this question about the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM), and I'm trying to remember what I learned about it. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking when a person is most likely to rely on the "central route" of processing information. From what I recall, the ELM was developed by Petty and Cacioppo, right? It's about how people process persuasive messages. The model suggests two main routes: central and peripheral.

The central route involves careful, thoughtful consideration of the message arguments. People engage in this when they have the motivation and ability to think deeply about the issue. On the other hand, the peripheral route is more superficial, where people might rely on cues like the speaker's appearance or the number of arguments presented, rather than the actual content.

So the question is about when the central route is used. The options are A through I, and I need to pick the correct one.

Let's look at the options one by one.

Option A: "the message is within his 'latitude of acceptance.'" Hmm, I think the latitude of acceptance refers to the range of attitudes a person finds acceptable. If the message falls within this range, they might be more open to it, but does that mean they use the central route? I'm not entirely sure. I remember that when a message is within the latitude of acceptance, it's more likely to be accepted without much thought, maybe through the peripheral route. Or wait, maybe it's the opposite. If the message is within their acceptable range, they might not feel the need to think critically because it aligns with their existing views. So maybe in that case, they might rely less on the central route.

Option B: "he is in a neutral or slightly negative mood." Mood can influence processing. I think a positive mood might make people more likely to use the peripheral route because they're in a good mood and might not feel the need to think deeply. A neutral or negative mood might make them more likely to engage in central processing because they're more critical or analytical. But I'm not certain about this. Maybe it's the opposite; perhaps a negative mood could lead to more processing if the issue is relevant.

Option C: "the message is outside his 'latitude of acceptance.'" This would mean the message is something he doesn't agree with. I think when a message is outside the latitude of acceptance, people might be more motivated to counterargue, which would involve more elaborate processing. So if the message is outside, they might engage more in the central route because they're analyzing why they disagree. Or is it that if it's outside, they might dismiss it without much thought, using the peripheral route? I'm a bit confused here.

Option D: "everyone else in the group disagrees with the message." Social pressure can influence processing. If everyone else disagrees, the person might feel the need to think more carefully before deciding, perhaps using the central route. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, they might just go along with the group without much thought, using the peripheral route because of social cues.

Option E: "everyone else in the group agrees with the message." Similar to D, if everyone agrees, the person might follow the majority without deep thinking, using peripheral cues. So this might not be the case where central processing happens.

Option F: "he strongly disagrees with the message." If someone strongly disagrees, they might be more motivated to think critically about the message, perhaps counterarguing, which is part of the central route. So this could be a candidate.

Option G: "the message is irrelevant to his current situation." If the message doesn't matter to him, he's less likely to engage in deep processing. So he'd use the peripheral route, if at all. So this doesn't fit.

Option H: "he thinks the message is boring." If it's boring, he might not pay much attention, leading to peripheral processing. So central route is less likely here.

Option I: "he is distracted while receiving the message." Distractions would reduce the ability to process deeply, so he'd rely more on peripheral cues. Thus, this isn't when central route is used.

Now, let's piece this together. The central route is used when the person is motivated and able to process the information deeply. So factors that increase motivation and ability would lead to central processing.

Looking again at the options, the "latitude of acceptance" is a concept from Social Judgment Theory, right? Messages within the latitude of acceptance are more likely to be accepted, but perhaps without much deep thinking. Messages outside this latitude might prompt more thinking because the person is considering why they don't agree. Alternatively, if the message is within their acceptance range, they might agree without much thought, using the peripheral route.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Let me think again. The ELM suggests that when people are highly motivated (like when the issue is personally relevant or important), they engage in more central processing. So the question is, which option indicates high motivation or personal relevance.

Option C says the message is outside his latitude of acceptance. That might mean it's something he doesn't currently agree with. So if he's considering a message that's outside his current views, he might be more motivated to think about it, especially if it's important to him. So in that case, he might engage in central processing.

Option F says he strongly disagrees with the message. If he's already decided he disagrees, he might be more likely to engage in counterarguments, which is part of the central route.

Wait, but the question is about when a person is most likely to use the central route. So which condition leads to that.

Another thought: The central route is more likely when the person has both the ability and motivation to think about the message. So, for example, if the message is relevant to them, they might be more motivated.

Looking back at the options, perhaps option A is when the message is within his latitude of acceptance. So if a message is within that range, he's more likely to agree without much thought, relying on the peripheral route. Conversely, if it's outside (option C), he might be more likely to engage in central processing because he's considering whether to change his views.

Alternatively, if the message is outside, he might dismiss it without much thought, but I think the ELM would suggest that if the message is outside but the person is still considering it, they might engage more deeply.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to recall some examples or key points. Petty and Cacioppo's model says that central route processing is more likely when the person is highly involved or motivated by the topic. So, for instance, if the issue is very important or relevant to them, they'll think more deeply about it.

Looking at the options, none directly mention personal relevance or importance, but perhaps the closest is when the message is outside their latitude of acceptance. Because if the message is outside, but they're considering it, it might mean it's something they care about and thus process more deeply.

Wait, but another thought: the latitude of acceptance is the range of positions a person considers acceptable. If a message is within that range, they might not feel the need to think much because it's already acceptable. If it's outside, they might either reject it without thought or, if motivated, think more about it.

But the question is about when they're most likely to use the central route. So perhaps when the message is within their latitude of acceptance, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about option A: message within latitude of acceptance. If the message is within what they already accept, maybe they don't need to process it deeply—so peripheral route. If it's outside, they might process it more, using the central route to see if they should accept it or not.

So, I think option C might be the correct answer. Because when the message is outside their latitude of acceptance, they might engage in more central processing to evaluate whether to accept it or not.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me try to think of it another way. Suppose someone presents an argument that's against your current beliefs. If you're motivated to understand why they're wrong, you'll engage in central processing, analyzing the arguments. So, that's when the message is outside your latitude of acceptance.

So the correct answer would be C: the message is outside his "latitude of acceptance."

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Another angle: the ELM's central route is about systematic, thoughtful processing. So, if the message is outside the latitude of acceptance, the person might be more likely to engage in counterarguing, which is a part of central processing.

Yes, that makes sense. So when the message is outside their current views, they are more likely to think deeply about it, using the central route.

The Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM), developed by Petty and Cacioppo, describes two routes of processing persuasive messages: the central route and the peripheral route. The central route involves careful, thoughtful consideration of the message's arguments and is more likely to occur when individuals are motivated and able to engage in deep processing. The peripheral route, in contrast, is more superficial and relies on cues like speaker appearance or the number of arguments presented.

To determine when a person is most likely to rely on the central route, we analyze the options:

- **Option A**: If the message is within the person's "latitude of acceptance," it aligns with their existing beliefs, making them less likely to engage in deep processing. They might accept the message without much thought, relying on the peripheral route.
  
- **Option B**: A neutral or slightly negative mood might influence processing, but there is no clear indication that this directly leads to central route processing. Mood effects are less central to the ELM.

- **Option C**: If the message is outside the person's "latitude of acceptance," it is more likely to prompt central processing. When a message contradicts their beliefs, individuals are motivated to evaluate it critically, engage in counterarguing, and think deeply about the arguments.

- **Option D**: If everyone else in the group disagrees with the message, social pressure might lead to peripheral processing, as individuals might follow the group without deep analysis.

- **Option E**: If everyone else in the group agrees with the message, individuals might also rely on peripheral cues, such as social consensus, rather than engaging in central processing.

- **Option F**: If the person strongly disagrees with the message, they might engage in counterarguing, which is part of central processing. However, this is not the most direct indicator of central route use compared to Option C.

- **Option G**: If the message is irrelevant to the person's current situation, they are less likely to engage in deep processing, making peripheral route processing more likely.

- **Option H**: If the person finds the message boring, they are less likely to engage in central processing and more likely to rely on peripheral cues.

- **Option I**: If the person is distracted while receiving the message, their ability to engage in deep processing is impaired, making peripheral route processing more likely.

The central route is most likely when the message is outside the person's "latitude of acceptance," as this motivates them to carefully evaluate the arguments and consider whether to change their beliefs. This aligns with the ELM's emphasis on motivation and ability to process information deeply.

**Answer: C**
