Question:

Assume that the charge of the proton is distributed uniformly throughout the volume of a sphere of radius $10^{-13} \mathrm{~cm}$. Use perturbation theory to estimate the shift in the ground-state hydrogen-atom energy due to the finite proton size. The potential energy experienced by the electron when it has penetrated the nucleus and is at distance $r$ from the nuclear center is $-e Q / 4 \pi \varepsilon_0 r$, where $Q$ is the amount of proton charge within the sphere of radius $r$. The evaluation of the integral is simplified by noting that the exponential factor in $\psi$ is essentially equal to 1 within the nucleus.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the shift in the ground-state hydrogen atom energy due to the finite size of the proton. Hmm, I remember that in perturbation theory, we treat small disturbances to the system. The proton is usually considered a point charge, but here it's a sphere with a radius of 1e-13 cm. 

The problem says the charge of the proton is distributed uniformly. So when the electron is inside the nucleus (r less than the proton radius), the potential it experiences is different from the point charge case. The potential inside is given as -eQ/(4πε₀ r), where Q is the charge within radius r.

Wait, I think I remember that for a uniformly charged sphere, the electric field inside increases linearly with r. Oh right, the charge enclosed Q would be (r^3 / R^3) times the total charge, where R is the radius of the proton (1e-13 cm). So Q = e*(r^3)/(R^3), since the total charge is e.

So substituting Q into the potential, the potential energy inside becomes -e * [e (r³/R³)]/(4πε₀ r). Simplifying that, the r in the denominator cancels one r from r³, leaving r². So the potential energy inside is -e² r²/(4πε₀ R³) * (1/3?), wait no, let me compute it correctly.

Wait, let me redo that substitution. Q is (e r³)/(R³), so the potential is -e * Q/(4πε₀ r) = -e*(e r³/(R³)) / (4πε₀ r) ). Oh wait, the denominator is r, so this becomes -e² r²/(4 π ε₀ R³). So the potential energy inside is proportional to r². Interesting.

In the ground state, the electron's wavefunction is ψ_100, which is spherically symmetric. The perturbation is the change in potential energy when the electron is inside the proton. So the first-order energy shift ΔE is the expectation value of this perturbing potential.

So ΔE = integral of ψ* V_pert ψ d³r, where V_pert is the difference between the actual potential and the point charge potential inside the nucleus. Wait, no, wait. The potential when inside is different. So the perturbation is V = V_finite - V_point. But wait, in the region r < R, V_finite is as given, and V_point is -e²/(4πε₀ r). So the perturbation is V = [(-e² r²)/(4 π ε₀ R³)] - [(-e²)/(4 π ε₀ r)].

Wait, wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, the perturbation is the change in the potential when the charge is spread out. So for r < R, the potential isn't -e²/(4π ε₀ r) anymore. It's given by -eQ/(4π ε₀ r) where Q is proportional to r³. So perhaps the perturbing potential is the difference between the finite case and the point charge.

Wait, maybe I should model the perturbation as the difference between the actual potential and the point charge potential. So for r < R, the actual potential is V(r) = -e Q/(4 π ε₀ r) = -e*(e r³/(R³)) / (4 π ε₀ r) ) = -e² r²/(4 π ε₀ R³). The point charge potential is V_point(r) = -e²/(4 π ε₀ r). So the perturbation V_pert is V(r) - V_point(r) = [ -e² r²/(4 π ε₀ R³) ] - [ -e²/(4 π ε₀ r) ] = e²/(4 π ε₀) [ -r²/R³ + 1/r ].

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the finite size effect is considered as a small correction, so the perturbation is the difference in potential. So maybe the perturbing potential is the actual potential minus the point charge potential. But because the point charge potential goes as 1/r, and the actual goes as r², their difference would be significant only within the nucleus.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact form of the perturbation. Maybe a better approach is to model it as follows: The potential energy outside the nucleus (r > R) is the same as the point charge, so the perturbation is only non-zero inside the nucleus. So for r < R, the potential is different.

So the perturbation is V_pert(r) = [ -e Q/(4 π ε₀ r) ] - [ -e^2/(4 π ε₀ r) ].

Wait, because Q is the charge inside radius r, which is (r³/R³) e. So substituting that, V_pert(r) = [ -e ( (r³ e)/(R³) )/(4 π ε₀ r) ) ] - [ -e^2/(4 π ε₀ r) ].

Simplify that: [ -e^2 r²/(4 π ε₀ R³) ) ] - [ -e^2/(4 π ε₀ r) ].

So V_pert(r) = (e²/(4 π ε₀)) [ (-r²/R³) + 1/r ].

Wait, but this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the finite potential is a correction to the point charge, so the perturbation is the finite part minus the point inside. Wait, but perhaps I should just consider that within the nucleus, the potential is different, and thus the perturbation is the difference between the actual potential and the point charge potential.

Wait, but for the region r < R, the point charge potential would be -e²/(4 π ε₀ r), but the actual potential is -e² r²/(4 π ε₀ R³). So the perturbation is the difference between the two: V_pert(r) = [ -e² r²/(4 π ε₀ R³) ] - [ -e²/(4 π ε₀ r) ].

Wait, but that would give V_pert(r) = e²/(4 π ε₀) [ 1/r - r²/(R³) ].

Wait, but wait, that might not be the right approach. Because the perturbation is the change in potential energy due to the finite size. So the original potential is V0(r) = -e²/(4 π ε₀ r) for all r. The actual potential is V(r) = V0(r) when r>R, and V(r) = -e Q/(4 π ε₀ r) when r < R. So the perturbation is V_pert(r) = V(r) - V0(r) for r < R, and zero otherwise.

So for r < R, V_pert(r) = [ -e Q/(4 π ε₀ r) ] - [ -e²/(4 π ε₀ r) ].

But wait, Q is the charge enclosed, which is (r³ / R³) e. So substituting, we get:

V_pert(r) = [ -e * (e r³ / R³) / (4 π ε₀ r) ) ] - [ -e²/(4 π ε₀ r) ].

Simplify that: the first term is -e² r²/(4 π ε₀ R³), the second term is + e²/(4 π ε₀ r). So V_pert(r) = e²/(4 π ε₀) [ - r²/(R³) + 1/r ].

Hmm, but integrating this might be tricky. Wait, but in the problem statement, it says that the exponential factor in ψ is essentially 1 within the nucleus. The ground state wavefunction is ψ_100(r) = (1/(√π a³))^(1/2) e^{-r/a}, where a is the Bohr radius. Since the proton radius R is 1e-13 cm, which is much smaller than the Bohr radius (about 0.5e-8 cm), the exponential e^{-r/a} is approximately e^0 = 1 for r << a. So we can approximate ψ(r) as constant, ψ(r) ≈ (1/(√π a³))^(1/2) * 1.

So the wavefunction squared is |ψ|^2 ≈ 1/(π a³). So the expectation value of V_pert is the integral from 0 to R of V_pert(r) * |ψ|^2 * 4 π r² dr.

So ΔE = ∫ (from 0 to R) [V_pert(r)] * |ψ|^2 * 4 π r² dr.

Plugging in V_pert(r):

ΔE = (e²/(4 π ε₀)) ∫ [ (-r²/R³ ) + 1/r ] * [1/(π a³)] * 4 π r² dr.

Simplify the constants:

( e²/(4 π ε₀) ) * (1/(π a³)) ) * 4 π = e²/(4 π ε₀) * 4 π / (π a³) ) = e²/( (4 π ε₀) * (π a³) )) *4 π ) → Wait, let me compute step by step.

The constants:

(e²/(4 π ε₀)) * (1/(π a³)) * 4 π = e²/(4 π ε₀) * (4 π) / (π a³) ) = [e² *4 π ] / [4 π ε₀ * π a³ ].

Wait, 4 pi in numerator and denominator cancels, so it's e²/( ε₀ * π a³ ).

So the integral becomes:

ΔE = [e²/( ε₀ π a³ ) ] * ∫ (from 0 to R) [ (-r²/R³ ) + 1/r ] * r² dr.

Wait, because the integrand is [ (-r²/R^3) + 1/r ] * r². So let's distribute that:

Each term multiplied by r²:

First term: (-r²/R^3)*r² = -r^4/R^3.

Second term: (1/r) * r² = r.

So the integral becomes ∫ [ -r^4/R³ + r ] dr from 0 to R.

Compute the integral term by term.

Integral of -r^4/R³ dr: 

-1/R³ ∫ r^4 dr = -1/R³ * (r^5 /5) evaluated from 0 to R → - (R^5)/(5 R³) ) = - R²/(5).

Integral of r dr: 

∫ r dr from 0 to R → (r²/2) from 0 to R → R²/2.

So total integral is [ -R²/5 + R²/2 ] = R² ( (-1/5) + (1/2) ) ) = R² ( ( -2 +5 ) /10 ) = R² (3/10 ) = (3 R²)/10.

Putting it back into ΔE:

ΔE = [e²/( ε₀ π a³ ) ] * (3 R² / 10 ).

Wait, but wait: when I computed the integral, I think I have to be careful. Let me recheck:

Integral from 0 to R of [ -r^4/R^3 + r ] dr.

So ∫ (-r^4/R^3) dr = -1/(R^3) * [r^5/5] from 0 to R → - (R^5)/(5 R^3) )= - R^2/5.

∫ r dr = [r^2/2] from 0 to R → R^2/2.

So sum is (-R²/5 + R²/2) = R² ( -1/5 + 1/2 ) = R² ( 3/10 ).

So the integral is (3 R²)/10.

So ΔE = [e²/( ε₀ π a³ ) ] * (3 R² /10 )

Now, substituting the known values.

Constants:

e (proton charge) is 1.6e-19 C.

ε₀ is 8.85e-12 C²/(N·m²).

a (Bohr radius) is about 5.29e-11 meters, or 5.29e-9 cm. Wait, wait, the question gives R as 1e-13 cm. So I need to make sure units are consistent. Let's convert R to meters: 1e-13 cm = 1e-15 meters. Because 1 cm is 1e-2 meters, so 1e-13 cm is 1e-15 m.

Wait, but in calculations, perhaps it's easier to keep in cm first, then convert to meters. Alternatively, let's work in meters.

So R = 1e-13 cm = 1e-15 m.

Wait, but let me double-check unit consistency.

Let me write all the constants in SI units.

e = 1.6e-19 C.

ε₀ = 8.85e-12 F/m (C²/(N·m²)).

a = Bohr radius = ~5.29e-11 m.

Wait, but the expression has a^3 in the denominator, so let me compute each term.

Compute numerator: e² = (1.6e-19)^2 ≈ 2.56e-38 C².

Denominator: ε₀ π a^3.

Compute a^3: (5.29e-11 m)^3 ≈ (5.29)^3 * 1e-33 m^3 ≈ 148.0 * 1e-33 m³ → 1.48e-31 m³.

So denominator: ε₀ π a³ = 8.85e-12 * 3.1416 * 1.48e-31 ≈ Let's compute this:

8.85e-12 * 3.1416 ≈ 27.8e-12.

27.8e-12 * 1.48e-31 ≈ 4.11e-42.

So denominator is approx 4.11e-42 (units: F·m³, which is C²·s²/(kg·m³)·m³ → but perhaps not necessary for dimensional analysis here).

So numerator / denominator: 2.56e-38 / 4.11e-42 → approx 6.23e3.

Wait, 2.56e-38 /4.11e-42 → (2.56/4.11) * 1e4 → approx 0.623 * 1e4 → 6230.

So 6230, but then we have the factor (3 R^2)/(10).

R is 1e-15 m. R squared is 1e-30 m².

So (3/(10)) * R² = (0.3) * 1e-30 m² = 3e-31 m².

So multiplying this with the 6230:

6230 * 3e-31 m² → 6230 *3 = 18690 → 1.869e4 * 1e-31 → 1.869e-27 J·m²? Wait, wait, perhaps I'm getting the units wrong, but let me proceed with the numbers.

Wait, wait. Let me re-express the entire expression:

ΔE = (e² / (ε₀ π a³)) * (3 R² / 10 )

So substituting the numbers:

e² = (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38 C².

ε₀ = 8.85e-12 C²/(N·m²).

a^3 = (5.29e-11 m)^3 ≈ 1.48e-31 m³.

R^2 = (1e-15 m)^2 = 1e-30 m².

So plug in:

ΔE = [2.56e-38 / (8.85e-12 * 3.1416 * 1.48e-31) ] * (3 * 1e-30 /10 )

Wait, let me compute denominator first: 8.85e-12 * π * 1.48e-31.

8.85e-12 * 3.1416 ≈ 27.8e-12.

27.8e-12 * 1.48e-31 ≈ 4.11e-42.

So denominator is 4.11e-42.

So [2.56e-38 / 4.11e-42 ] = (2.56 /4.11 ) * 1e4 ≈ 0.623 * 1e4 → ~6230.

Now, the second term: (3 * 1e-30 ) /10 → (3e-30)/10 = 3e-31.

Multiply 6230 by 3e-31: 6230 *3e-31 = 1.869e-27.

Wait, but wait, the units. The entire expression is [e²/( ε₀ a³ ) ] * [ R² ].

e² has units of C².

ε₀ has units of C²·s²/(kg·m³).

a^3 is m³.

R² is m².

So e²/( ε₀ a³ ) → (C²) / [ (C² s²)/(kg m³) ) * m³ ] → (1) / (s²/(kg)) ) → kg s².

Multiply by R² (m²) → kg s² * m² → which is Joule (since 1 J = 1 kg m²/s² → so kg s² m² is J).

So the entire expression is in Joule. But the options are in eV. So I need to convert from Joule to eV.

So 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J. So ΔE in eV is ΔE (J) / 1.6e-19.

So ΔE is approximately 1.869e-27 J.

So in eV: 1.869e-27 / 1.6e-19 ≈ (1.869 /1.6 ) * 1e-8 → approx 1.168e-8 eV.

Looking at the options, option C is 1.2e-8, option J is 1.6e-8, option A is 1.4e-8.

Wait, my approximate calculation gives ~1.17e-8 eV. So option C is 1.2e-8, which is the closest. But perhaps I made some approximation errors.

Wait, let me verify the calculation again more accurately.

Let me compute each step with more precision.

First, e²/(4 pi epsilon_0 a) is known as
