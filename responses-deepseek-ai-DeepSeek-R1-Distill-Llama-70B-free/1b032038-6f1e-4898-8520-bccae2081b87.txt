Okay, so I have this physics problem about prisms and their refraction. Hmm, let me think. I remember that prisms bend light, and this has to do with the index of refraction and something called prism diopters. 

The problem says a prism with a refracting angle of 1°25' bends a light beam through 1°15'. I need to find the index of refraction and the power of the prism. The options are A to J, each giving two values. 

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formulas here. I think when light passes through a prism, it gets refracted twice—once when entering and once when exiting. So the total deviation is the sum of both refractions. Oh right, the formula for the deviation by a prism is given by Δ = (n - 1) * α, where α is the apex angle of the prism, and n is the refractive index. Or wait, is it the other way around? Let me make sure.

Wait, no. The deviation δ for a small angle can be approximated by δ ≈ (n - 1) * α, where α is the apex angle. But wait, the problem gives the angle of bending as 1°15'. So I think that in this case, the bending angle is the deviation δ. 

Wait, maybe I should think about this more carefully. The total deviation δ caused by a prism is given by δ = 2 * (α/2) * (n - 1). No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the deviation when the prism is placed in a way that the light hits symmetrically is δ = (n - 1)*α. So if the apex angle is α, and the light is entering and exiting symmetrically, then the deviation is (n-1)*α. 

So in this problem, the prism's refracting angle (apex angle) is 1°25', which is 1 degree and 25 minutes. I think I need to convert that into decimal degrees. Since 1 minute is 1/60 of a degree, so 25' is 25/60 ≈ 0.4167 degrees. So α = 1.4167 degrees.

The beam is bent through 1°15', which is 1.25 degrees. So the deviation δ is 1.25 degrees.

So according to the formula δ = (n-1)*α, we can solve for n.

So rearranging, n = (δ / α) + 1.

Plugging in the numbers: δ is 1.25°, α is 1.4167°.

Let me calculate δ/α: 1.25 / 1.4167. Let me compute that. 1.25 divided by approximately 1.4167. Hmm. Let's see, 1.4167 * 0.88 is roughly 1.25? Because 1.4167 * 0.8 is 1.1333, 0.88 would be 1.4167 * 0.08=0.1133, so total 1.2466. Oh wait, that's close to 1.25. So 0.88, approximately. So 1.25/1.4167 ≈ 0.88. So n ≈ 0.88 + 1 = 1.88.

Wait, that's the index of refraction. So n is approximately 1.88. 

Now, the power of the prism is given in prism diopters. I think the formula for prism power (in diopters) is the deviation in minutes divided by 10. Because 1 prism diopter is the deviation of 1 cm per meter, which is 1 minute of arc (since 1 meter is 100 cm, 1 cm/m is 1/100, which is tan(1'), approximately). So 1 prism diopter equals 1 minute of deviation.

Wait, no. Wait, actually, I think the prism diopter (Δ) is calculated as Δ (in diopters) = deviation in minutes / 10. Because 1 diopter is 1 m^-1, and for small angles, 1 diopter corresponds to a deviation of about 1/60 degrees, which is 1 minute. So if the deviation is δ minutes, then the prism diopter is δ / 10.

Wait, wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Prism power is defined as the deviation in centimeters per meter. So if a prism causes a deviation of δ cm per meter, then the power is δ diopters. But for small angles, the deviation in cm/m is approximately equal to the tangent of the angle in radians. So δ (in cm/m) ≈ tan(θ), where θ is the deviation angle in radians. 

But for small angles, tan θ ≈ θ in radians. So to convert θ to cm/m, we can compute θ in radians and multiply by 100 (since 1 m = 100 cm). So, for example, θ in radians is (θ_deg * π/180). So cm/m = (θ_deg * π/180) * 100 cm/m. 

Wait, let me see: 1 radian is about 57.3 degrees. So for θ in degrees, radians are θ * π / 180. So tan θ ≈ θ in radians for small angles.

So cm/m = θ (radians) * 100 cm/m. So cm/m = (θ_deg * π/180) * 100.

But prism diopter is cm/m, so Δ (diopters) = (θ_deg * π/180) * 100.

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, I've heard that 1 diopter is approximately 1/60 of a degree. Wait, 1 degree is 60 minutes, so 1 minute is 1/60 degree. So when the deviation is 1 minute, that's approximately 1 diopter? No, wait. Because 1 diopter is 1 m^-1, which is 1 cm per meter. So for small angles, tan(theta) ≈ theta in radians. So theta = deviation in radians. So tan(theta) = opposite/adjacent = 0.01 m (1 cm) / 1 m = 0.01. So theta ≈ 0.01 radians. 

Convert that to degrees: 0.01 radians * (180/pi) ) ≈ 0.01 * 57.3 ≈ 0.573 degrees. Wait, that can’t be right because 1 diopter would cause about half a degree of deviation. But in the problem, the deviation is 1.25 degrees, which would be more than 2 diopters. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing something up.

Wait, maybe the formula is simpler. I remember that the prism power in diopters is equal to the deviation in minutes divided by 10. So if the deviation δ is in minutes, then diopters = δ / 10.

In this problem, the deviation is 1°15', which is 75 minutes (since 1 degree is 60 minutes, so 60+15=75). So prism diopter would be 75 / 10 = 7.5? But wait, that doesn't match any of the options. Hmm, that suggests I'm wrong here. Because looking at the options, the highest power is 2.18, like in option A and D.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Another approach: the formula for prism diopter is the deviation in degrees multiplied by 100 and divided by (n-1), but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe another way. I think the power of a prism (in prism-diopters) is given by the formula: Power (Δ) = (n - 1) * α, where α is in degrees. Wait, but earlier we used that formula for the deviation. Oh wait, no, that formula gives the deviation in degrees when the prism is made of index n and has apex angle α. So the deviation is (n-1)*α, which in this case is 1.25 degrees. So that gives us the (n-1) * 1.4167 = 1.25, which we used to find n≈1.88.

Wait, but for prism diopters, I think the formula is different. I think the definition is that 1 prism diopter is the deviation of 1 cm per meter, which as we discussed earlier relates to the tangent of the angle. So if the deviation angle is θ degrees, then tanθ = (0.01 m) / (1 m) )= 0.01. But for small angles, tanθ ≈ θ in radians. So θ ≈ 0.01 radians. To convert to degrees, 0.01 * (180/pi) ≈ 0.5729 degrees, which is about 34.37 minutes. Wait, that's confusing. So 1 diopter is a deviation of about 34.37 minutes of arc. So to find the diopter, we have θ in degrees, convert to minutes, and divide by 34.37?

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the exact formula. The prism power D in diopters is given by D = 100 * tan(θ), where θ is in degrees. Because tan(theta) is the deviation in cm/m (since tan(theta) = opposite/adjacent = (0.01 m)/(1 m) )= 0.01 for 1 diopter. Wait, no, 0.01 m is 1 cm. So tan(theta) = (deviation in cm) / (adjacent in m). So for 1 diopter, deviation is 1 cm per m, so tan(theta) = 0.01 m / 1 m = 0.01. So theta = arctan(0.01) ≈ 0.57 degrees, which is about 34.2 minutes. So 1 diopter corresponds to about 34.2 minutes of arc.

So if the deviation is θ minutes, then the diopter D is θ / 34.2 ≈ θ / 34.2.

Wait, no, because 34.2 minutes is 1 diopter. So for θ minutes, D = θ / 34.2.

In our case, the deviation is 1°15' which is 75 minutes (60+15=75). So D = 75 / 34.2 ≈ 2.19 prism-diopters. 

Wait, but let me compute that accurately. 75 divided by 34.2. Let's see, 34.2 * 2 = 68.4. 75 -68.4=6.6. So 6.6 /34.2 ≈ 0.193. So total D≈2.193, approximately 2.19 prism diopters.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option A says Power of the prism is 1.88 prism diopters. Option D says 2.18. Option I has 2.18 for power but n is 1.88. Hmm, my calculation gives D≈2.19. So looking at the options, the closest is option D, which has power 2.18. Or option A has 1.88, which is lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the calculation. Let me recalculate. Let's see: the deviation is 75 minutes. So D = 75 / 34.2.

Compute 75 ÷ 34.2. Let me do that division. 34.2 × 2 is 68.4. Subtracting from 75 gives 6.6. 6.6 / 34.2 ≈ 0.1929. So total is about 2.1929, which is approximately 2.19. So the closest option is D, which has power 2.18. 

Wait, but wait another thing. I think I might have mixed up the formulas. Another approach: sometimes, the prism power is calculated as (n-1) * (apex angle in degrees) / (1 degree). Or another way, because the apex angle is in degrees, and (n-1)*α gives the deviation in degrees. So the deviation is δ = (n-1)*α. So in this case, δ is 1.25 degrees, and α is 1.4167 degrees. So (n-1) = 1.25 / 1.4167 ≈ 0.88, so n≈1.88.

So that's correct for the index of refraction.

Now, for the prism power, I think it's best to use the formula that power in diopters is (n-1)*α, but wait, no, that gives the deviation in degrees. So perhaps that's not the right approach.

Wait, another formula I found elsewhere: the prism power (in diopters) is the deviation in minutes divided by 10. So δ is 75 minutes, so 75 /10 = 7.5 diopters. But that's not matching any of the options here. So perhaps that formula isn't correct. Alternatively, maybe the formula is the deviation in degrees multiplied by some factor.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Power (prism diopters) = (n-1) * (apex angle in degrees) * 100. Because 1 diopter is 1 m^-1, which is 100 cm/m. So (n-1) * (apex in degrees) * (pi/180) gives the deviation in radians, which is tan(theta) ≈ theta. So tan(theta) = (n-1) * (alpha) * (pi/180). Then, tan(theta) is the deviation in cm/m. So prism diopters D = (n-1) * alpha * (pi/180) * 100, since 1 cm is 0.01 m, so cm/m is 0.01 D, where D is diopters.

Wait, maybe it's better to approach it this way. Prism power D is defined as the deviation in cm per meter. So, D = deviation (cm) / (adjacent side, m). Since the deviation is small, tan(theta) ≈ theta in radians. So tan(theta) = (deviation in cm) / (1 m) ) = D / 100, because 1 m is 100 cm. So D = 100 * tan(theta). But theta is in radians. So theta (radians) = D / 100.

Alternatively, to find D in prism diopters, D = 100 * tan(theta), where theta is the deviation angle in radians.

So, in our case, theta is 1.25 degrees. Let me convert that to radians. 1.25 degrees * (pi/180) ≈ 0.0218 radians. So tan(theta) ≈ 0.0218 (since for small theta, tan(theta) ≈ theta). So D = 100 * 0.0218 ≈ 2.18 prism diopters.

Ah! So that makes sense. So D is approximately 2.18 prism diopters.

So putting it all together: the index of refraction is about 1.88, and the prism power is about 2.18 diopters.

Looking at the options, option A says index 2.18 and power 1.88. No, that's the opposite. Option D says index 2.18, power 2.18. No, our index was 1.88, so that doesn't fit. Option I: index 1.88, power 2.18. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, option I: index of refraction 1.880, power 2.18 prism diopters. Yes, that matches our calculations. So the correct answer would be option I.

To solve the problem, we start by using the formula for the deviation caused by a prism:

\[
\delta = (n - 1) \cdot \alpha
\]

where:
- \( \delta \) is the deviation angle (1°15' = 1.25°),
- \( \alpha \) is the refracting angle of the prism (1°25' = 1.4167°),
- \( n \) is the index of refraction.

Rearranging the formula to solve for \( n \):

\[
n = \frac{\delta}{\alpha} + 1
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
n = \frac{1.25}{1.4167} + 1 \approx 0.88 + 1 = 1.88
\]

Thus, the index of refraction is approximately \( n = 1.88 \).

Next, to calculate the power of the prism in prism-diopters, we use the relationship between the deviation angle and prism power. The deviation angle is given as 1°15', which is 75 minutes. The formula for prism power is:

\[
\text{Power (prism-diopters)} = \frac{\text{Deviation in minutes}}{34.2}
\]

Substituting the deviation in minutes:

\[
\text{Power} = \frac{75}{34.2} \approx 2.19 \, \text{prism-diopters}
\]

This rounds to approximately \( 2.18 \, \text{prism-diopters} \).

Finally, comparing the calculated values (\( n = 1.88 \), Power = 2.18) with the given options, the correct match is:

**Option I: Index of refraction = 1.880, Power of the prism = 2.18 prism-diopters.**
