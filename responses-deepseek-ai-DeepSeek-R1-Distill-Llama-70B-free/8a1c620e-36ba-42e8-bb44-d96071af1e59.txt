Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem is about an ideal gas undergoing expansion against a constant external pressure. The chemist found that the volume changes from 50 to 150 liters, and 1.55 Kcal of heat was absorbed. We're supposed to find the internal energy change.

Hmm, I remember that internal energy change (ΔU) is related to heat (q) and work (w) by the first law of thermodynamics: ΔU = q + w. Wait, wait, no, wait. I think the first law is ΔU = q - w, where w is the work done by the system. Because when the system does work on the surroundings, it loses energy. So if work is done by the system, it's positive work, so ΔU decreases by that amount.

But wait, I'm a bit confused about the sign conventions. Let's clarify. The formula I remember is ΔU = q - PΔV when the process is at constant pressure. Oh wait, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here. Alternatively, the work done by the system is P_ext * ΔV, but only when the pressure is constant.

Wait, the problem states that the gas expands against a constant external pressure of 700 mmHg. So the work done by the system (the gas) is P_ext multiplied by the change in volume.

Right, so the formula for work is w = -P_ext * ΔV. Wait, but why the negative sign? Oh, because when the system does work on the surroundings (expansion), the work is considered negative from the system's perspective. But I think in the first law, ΔU = q + w, where w is the work done on the system. Wait, I'm getting myself mixed up.

Wait, let's clarify the conventions. In physics, work done by the system is taken as negative, so w would be negative. But in chemistry, sometimes w is the work done on the system, so if the system does work, it's negative. Hmm.

Wait, in the first law, the formula is ΔU = q + w, where w is work done on the system. So if the system does work on the surroundings (like expansion), then w is negative.

Alternatively, sometimes, especially in engineering, the formula is written as ΔU = q - PΔV. Wait, no, that's for when the pressure is constant. Oh, no, wait, that's when the process is at constant pressure. But in this problem, the external pressure is constant, but the system's pressure might be changing. Hmm.

Wait, no. In expansion against a constant external pressure, the work done by the system is P_ext multiplied by the change in volume, right? So the work done by the system is P_ext * (V_final - V_initial). But in terms of the system's internal energy, since the system is doing work, the internal energy decreases, so the work is negative.

Wait, but let's think again. The first law is ΔU = q + w, where w is the work done on the system. So if the system does work, w is negative. So in expansion, the system is doing work, so w is negative.

So the work done by the system is P_ext * ΔV (since ΔV is positive when expanding). So w (work done on the system) is - P_ext * ΔV.

So, in this case, the external pressure is 700 mmHg. But wait, the gas constant R is in terms of atmospheres, so I might need to convert mmHg to atm.

Wait, 1 atm is 760 mmHg, right? So 700 mmHg is 700/760 atm. Let me calculate that. 700 divided by 760 is approximately 0.92105 atm.

The change in volume ΔV is 150 L - 50 L = 100 L.

So, the work done by the system is P_ext * ΔV = (700/760 atm) * 100 L.

Wait, but the conversion factor given is 24.217 cal = 1 liter·atm. So to find the work in calories, I can calculate (P in atm) * (ΔV in L) and then multiply by 24.217 cal/(L·atm) to get the work in cal.

Wait, but since work done by the system is positive, but from the system's perspective, it's losing energy, so w would be negative.

So here, the work done on the system is negative, so w = - P_ext * ΔV.

Wait, let me proceed step by step.

First, calculate P_ext in atm:

700 mmHg * (1 atm / 760 mmHg) = 700/760 atm ≈ 0.92105 atm.

ΔV = 150 L - 50 L = 100 L.

Work done by the system, w_system = P_ext * ΔV = 0.92105 atm * 100 L = 92.105 L·atm.

But since the system is doing work on the surroundings, the work done on the system is negative. So, work w = -92.105 L·atm.

Now, convert L·atm to calories. Given that 1 L·atm = 24.217 cal.

So, work in calories: -92.105 L·atm * 24.217 cal/(L·atm) ≈ let me compute that.

Hmm, 92.105 * 24.217.

Let me approximate this.

92 * 24 is 2208, but let's do it more accurately.

92.105 * 24.217.

Compute 92 * 24 = 2208.

But perhaps it's better to compute 92.105 * 24.217.

Let me compute 92.105 *24 = ?

92 *24=2208, 0.105 *24=2.52 → 2208 +2.52=2210.52.

Now compute 92.105 *0.217.

Hmm, 92 *0.217= let's see: 90*0.217=19.53, 2*0.217=0.434 → 19.53+0.434=19.964.

0.105 *0.217≈0.0228.

So total for 92.105 *0.217 is ≈19.964 +0.0228≈19.9868.

So total 2210.52 +19.9868≈2230.5068 cal.

So the work is approximately -2230.5068 cal.

But wait, the work done on the system is negative, so w = -2230.5 cal.

Wait, but the first law is ΔU = q + w, where w is work done on the system. So if the system does work, w is negative.

So now, the heat absorbed is given as 1.55 Kcal, which is 1550 cal. Because Kcal is kilocalories, so 1 Kcal = 1000 cal.

So q is positive because heat is absorbed by the system.

So now, ΔU = q + w = 1550 cal + (-2230.5 cal) = 1550 -2230.5 = -680.5 cal.

Wait, that's in calories. But the answer options are in Kcal. So converting, -680.5 cal is -0.6805 Kcal.

Looking at the options, option I is -0.68 Kcal. That's very close to what we have.

Wait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, the work done by the system is P_ext * ΔV, so:

P_ext =700 mmHg =700/760 atm ≈0.92105 atm.

ΔV =100 L.

Work in L·atm: 0.92105 *100=92.105 L·atm.

Convert to cal: 92.105 *24.217 = ?

Let me compute that more accurately.

24.217 *92.105.

Compute 24 *92 = 2208.

24 *0.105=2.52.

0.217*92= let's see: 92*0.2=18.4, 92*0.017=1.564 → 18.4+1.564=19.964.

0.217 *0.105: 0.022785.

So adding all contributions:

2208 (from 24*92) + 2.52 (from 24*0.105) +19.964 (from 0.217*92) +0.022785 (from 0.217*0.105).

Wait, but wait, perhaps a better way is to just compute 92.105 *24.217.

Compute 92.105 *24 = 2210.52.

92.105 *0.217:

Let's calculate 92.105 *0.2 =18.421, 92.105 *0.017=1.5658 (since 92.105 *17=1565.8, so divided by 1000 is 1.5658). So 18.421 +1.5658 =19.9868.

So total is 2210.52 +19.9868=2230.5068 cal.

So yes, that's correct. So the work done by the system is 2230.5068 cal, so the work done on the system is -2230.5068 cal.

q is +1550 cal.

So ΔU =1550 -2230.5068 =-680.5068 cal, which is -0.6805 Kcal.

Looking at the options, option I is -0.68 Kcal, which matches.

Wait, but let me make sure about the formula. I used ΔU = q + w, where w is work done on the system. So when the system does work (expansion), w is negative, which reduces ΔU.

Yes, that makes sense. So the internal energy change is negative, indicating a decrease.

So the correct answer should be I.
</think>

To determine the internal energy change (ΔU) for the given process, we use the first law of thermodynamics:

\[
\Delta U = q + w
\]

where \( q \) is the heat absorbed by the system and \( w \) is the work done on the system. The problem specifies that 1.55 Kcal of heat is absorbed (\( q = +1550 \, \text{cal} \)) and the gas expands against a constant external pressure of 700 mmHg, with a volume change from 50 L to 150 L (\( \Delta V = 100 \, \text{L} \)).

### Step 1: Convert external pressure to atm
The external pressure is given as 700 mmHg. Converting to atm:

\[
P_{\text{ext}} = \frac{700}{760} \, \text{atm} \approx 0.92105 \, \text{atm}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate work done on the system
The work done on the system is given by:

\[
w = -P_{\text{ext}} \cdot \Delta V
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
w = -(0.92105 \, \text{atm}) \cdot (100 \, \text{L}) = -92.105 \, \text{L·atm}.
\]

Convert \( \text{L·atm} \) to calories using the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{L·atm} = 24.217 \, \text{cal} \):

\[
w = -92.105 \cdot 24.217 \, \text{cal} \approx -2230.5 \, \text{cal}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate internal energy change
Using the first law of thermodynamics:

\[
\Delta U = q + w
\]

Substitute \( q = +1550 \, \text{cal} \) and \( w = -2230.5 \, \text{cal} \):

\[
\Delta U = 1550 - 2230.5 = -680.5 \, \text{cal}.
\]

Convert to kilocalories:

\[
\Delta U \approx -0.6805 \, \text{Kcal}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with the closest option
The closest option to \( \Delta U \approx -0.6805 \, \text{Kcal} \) is **I: -0.68 Kcal**.
