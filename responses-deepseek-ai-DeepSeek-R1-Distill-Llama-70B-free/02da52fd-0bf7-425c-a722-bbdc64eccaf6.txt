Question:

This question refers to the following information.
In fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.
British journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860
Violence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a "humanness"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.
Rudrangshu Mukherjee, "The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857," 1990

Okay, so I've got this question about the Cawnpore massacres during the Indian Revolt of 1857. I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking about the perspective of the first passage regarding the death of British citizens at Cawnpore. There are four options: A, B, C, D.

First, I need to understand the first passage. It's from William Howard Russell's "My Indian Mutiny Diary" in 1860. The passage describes the Cawnpore massacres as particularly aggravating because the deeds were done by a subject race—black men shedding the blood of their masters, including women and children. It mentions that this wasn't just a servile war but also involved religion, race, revenge, hope, and national promptings to overthrow the stranger's yoke and re-establish native chiefs and religions.

So Russell is emphasizing that the mutiny involved multiple factors: race, religion, and a desire for self-rule. He points out that the leaders' strategy was the destruction of every white person they could find.

Now, the options are about how Russell views the deaths. Option A says it marks a betrayal of a "higher" race by a "lesser" race. That sounds like it's highlighting the racial aspect, which Russell does mention—he talks about the masters and the subject race. So this could fit.

Option B suggests it's a regrettable mistake. But Russell doesn't seem to express regret; he's more emphasizing the severity and the multiple factors driving the violence. So B might not be the right choice.

Option C says the British brought it on themselves. The passage doesn't explicitly state that; it's more about the nature of the mutiny and the reasons behind it, like race and religion, not that the British were responsible. So C might not be correct.

Option D says the killers saw it as a religious duty. The passage does mention that the mutiny was a war of religion, so maybe the perpetrators felt it was their duty. But Russell's focus is more on the fact that it's a subject race rising against their masters, which ties into race and hierarchy.

So putting it together, Russell's perspective seems to focus on the racial dynamic—how a subordinate race dared to kill their superiors. That fits with option A, which talks about a betrayal of a higher race by a lesser one.

I think the answer is A.
</think>

The first passage emphasizes the racial and social dynamics of the Cawnpore massacres, highlighting that the violence was perpetrated by a "subject race" against their British masters. This underscores a betrayal of the perceived racial hierarchy, where the "lesser" race defied the "higher" race. 

A: Correct. The passage portrays the killings as a breach of the racial order, where the subordinate race acted against their superiors.  
B: Incorrect. The passage does not frame the violence as a regrettable mistake but as a significant act driven by multiple factors.  
C: Incorrect. There is no indication that the British were responsible for the violence.  
D: Incorrect. While religion is mentioned, the focus is on race and the hierarchy, not on religious duty.  

Answer: A
