Okay, so I've got this problem about gas effusion, and I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but I'll try to work through it.

Alright, the question says we have a gaseous mixture that's 90% hydrogen and 10% deuterium by moles. It's at 25°C and 1 atm. It's effusing through a small pinhole. I need to find the composition of the initial gas that passes through.

Hmm, I remember that effusion relates to Graham's law. Graham's law says that the rate of effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass. So lighter gases effuse faster.

Wait, but the problem is about the composition of the gas that comes out first. Oh right, the lighter molecules will escape quicker, so the initial gas should be richer in hydrogen. But wait, the options don't seem to have a higher H2 concentration. Wait the initial question says the mixture is 90% H2 and 10% D2. So the initial effusion would have more H2 than the original mixture? No, wait, wait. No, the initial gas that passes through would be more H2-rich because H2 is lighter. But the options are about the mole percentages. Let me think.

Wait, wait. No, wait, the initial gas that comes through has a higher proportion of the lighter gas. So since H2 is lighter, the first gas should have more H2. But wait, H2 is already 90% in the mixture. So how can the initial gas have even more H2? Or does the initial gas's H2 percentage go down? No, because the H2 comes out faster, so the initial gas is richer in H2. So the mole percent of D2 would decrease, meaning H2 increases beyond 90% in the effused gas.

Wait no, that can't be right. Wait, because the original is 90% H2 and 10% D2. Let me think again. The initial effusion would be richer in H2 because it's lighter. So the D2 would be less in the initial gas. So the mole percent of D2 in the effused gas is lower than 10%, so the mole percent of H2 is higher than 90%.

Looking at the options, the possible answers would have H2 above 90% and D2 below 10%. Looking at the options:

Option C: D2=7.3% → H2=92.7%. That fits.

Option I: D2=8% → H2=92%? Wait, 8+92 is 100, but the original is 90-10. So I’s H2 is 92, D2 8. So that's higher H2 than original.

Wait, but according to the calculation, the lighter gas comes out more, so D2 would be less.

Wait, but Graham's law in terms of mole fractions. Let me think about the formula.

The formula for effusion is based on the rate. The rate is proportional to (1/sqrt(M)). So for each gas, the rate is Rate = (P * A) / (sqrt(M)) ), but wait, pressure is same since it's the same system.

Wait, perhaps the mole fraction in the effused gas is determined by the ratio of their rates.

So, for two gases, H2 and D2, their rates of effusion are proportional to 1/sqrt(M). So the ratio of their rates is sqrt(M2/M1).

Wait, M for H2 is 2 g/mol, D2 is 4 g/mol. So the ratio Rate H2 / Rate D2 = sqrt(4/2) = sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414.

So the H2 is effusing faster than D2 by a factor of sqrt(2). So in the initial effusion, the proportion of H2 in the effused gas is higher.

Wait, but wait. The initial gas mixture is 90% H2 and 10% D2. So the mole fractions are 0.9 and 0.1 respectively.

The rate of effusion for each is proportional to their mole fraction times the inverse sqrt of M. So the effusion rate for H2 is 0.9 * (1/sqrt(2)) ), and D2 is 0.1 * (1/sqrt(4)) = 0.1*(1/2).

Wait, maybe I should compute the ratio of their rates.

The rate of H2: Rate_H2 = (mole fraction) * (1/sqrt(M))

Similarly Rate_D2 = (mole fraction) * (1/sqrt(M))

So the ratio Rate_H2 / Rate_D2 = (0.9 / sqrt(2)) ) / (0.1 / sqrt(4)) )

Simplify that:

= (0.9 / sqrt(2)) ) * (sqrt(4)/0.1 )

= (0.9 * 2 ) / (0.1 * sqrt(2) )

= (1.8) / (0.1 * 1.4142 )

= 1.8 / 0.14142 ≈ 12.727.

So the ratio of H2 to D2 in the effused gas is about 12.727:1.

Wait, but wait, the initial question is about the mole percentages in the effused gas. So the mole fraction of H2 is (12.727/(1 + 12.727)) ) ≈ (12.727 /13.727 ) ≈ 0.927 → 92.7% H2, and 7.3% D2.

So looking at the options, option C says mole% D2=7.3%, H2=92.7%. So that's option C.

But wait, let me double-check. Because the question is about the initial gas that passes through. So the initial effusion would be richer in the lighter component, which is H2. So the D2 would be less than its original 10%, so 7.3% is less than 10% → correct.

So the correct answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we use Graham's law of effusion, which states that the rate of effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass. Since hydrogen (H₂) is lighter than deuterium (D₂), it will effuse faster. The initial gas that passes through the pinhole will therefore be richer in H₂ and poorer in D₂ compared to the original mixture.

The original mixture is 90% H₂ and 10% D₂ by mole. The molar masses of H₂ and D₂ are 2 g/mol and 4 g/mol, respectively. According to Graham's law, the ratio of the effusion rates of H₂ to D₂ is given by:

\[
\text{Rate ratio} = \sqrt{\frac{M_{\text{D}_2}}{M_{\text{H}_2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{4}{2}} = \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414
\]

This means H₂ effuses approximately 1.414 times faster than D₂. To calculate the mole fractions in the effused gas, we use the ratio of their rates. Let the mole fraction of H₂ in the effused gas be \( x \), and the mole fraction of D₂ be \( 1-x \). The ratio of their mole fractions is proportional to the ratio of their effusion rates:

\[
\frac{x}{1-x} = \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{1 + \sqrt{2}} \approx \frac{1.414}{1 + 1.414} \approx 0.927
\]

Thus, the mole fraction of H₂ in the effused gas is approximately 92.7%, and the mole fraction of D₂ is:

\[
1 - x \approx 1 - 0.927 = 0.073 \, \text{or} \, 7.3\%
\]

Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C: mole % D₂ = 7.30%, mole % H₂ = 92.70%**

This matches the calculated composition of the initial gas that passes through the pinhole.
