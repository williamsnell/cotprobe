Okay, so I've got this waveguide problem to solve. Hmm, let's see. The waveguide is air-filled and rectangular, with dimensions a=0.9 inches and b=0.4 inches. I need to find the cutoff frequencies for the dominant mode and the next higher-order mode, and then the attenuation factor for the next mode at a certain frequency.

Wait, first, I should remember what the dominant mode is in a rectangular waveguide. Oh right, the dominant mode is the TE10 mode, which has the lowest cutoff frequency. The next mode would be either TE20 or TE11, depending on the dimensions. Since a is larger than b, because a=0.9 and b=0.4, I think the TE20 mode comes next after TE10. Or wait, maybe TE11? Let me think. The cutoff frequency formula is fc = c/2 * sqrt((m/a)^2 + (n/b)^2), where c is speed of light, but wait, it's actually f_c = (1/2√(με)) * sqrt( (mπ/a)^2 + (nπ/b)^2 ) ). Since it's air-filled, μ and ε are μ0 and ε0, so the speed is c, so f_c = c/(2) * sqrt( (m/a)^2 + (n/b)^2 ), but wait, actually the formula is f_c (in Hz) = (1/2π√(μ ε)) ) * sqrt( (mπ/a)^2 + (nπ/b)^2 )). Hmm, maybe it's easier to use the speed of light as c = 3e8 m/s.

Wait, but another approach is to calculate the cutoff frequencies using the standard formula:

f_c = c/(2) * sqrt( (m/a)^2 + (n/b)^2 )

Wait no, actually, the correct formula is:

f_{c} = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{\mu \epsilon}} \sqrt{ \left( \frac{m\pi}{a} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{n\pi}{b} \right)^2 }

But since we're dealing with air, μ=μ0 and ε=ε0, so sqrt(μ ε) is sqrt(μ0 ε0) = 1/c, so substituting:

f_c = (1/(2π)) * sqrt( (m π /a )^2 + (n π /b )^2 ) * c.

Wait, let me compute this correctly. Let's see:

Wait, 1/(2π√(μ ε)) is 1/(2π*(1/c)) )= c/(2π). So:

f_c = (c/(2π)) ) * sqrt( (m π /a )^2 + (n π /b )^2 )

Simplify that:

= (c/(2π)) ) * π sqrt( (m/a)^2 + (n/b)^2 )

The π cancels:

= c/(2) * sqrt( (m/a)^2 + (n/b)^2 )

So yes, the cutoff frequency is (c/2) multiplied by the square root of (m/a)^2 + (n/b)^2.

So for the dominant mode TE10, m=1, n=0.

So f_c1 = (3e8 m/s) / 2 * (1/0.9 in) [Wait, but units here, inches need to be converted to meters.]

Wait, a is 0.9 inches. I need to convert inches to meters. 1 inch is approximately 0.0254 meters.

So a = 0.9 * 0.0254 m. Let me compute that:

0.9 * 0.0254 = 0.02286 meters.

Similarly, b = 0.4 inches = 0.4 * 0.0254 = 0.01016 meters.

So for TE10 mode:

f_c1 = (3e8 / 2 ) * sqrt( (1/0.02286)^2 + (0/0.01016)^2 )

Since n=0, the second term is zero.

So f_c1 = (3e8 / 2 ) * (1/0.02286 )

Calculating that:

1 / 0.02286 ≈ 43.74 per meter.

So 3e8 m/s is 300,000,000 m/s.

300e6 / 2 = 150e6.

150e6 * 43.74 ≈ Let's compute 150e6 * 43.74.

Wait, 150e6 * 43.74 = 150 * 43.74 * 1e6.

150 * 43.74 = Let's see, 100*43.74=4374, 50*43.74=2187. So total 4374+2187=6561.

So 6561e6 Hz = 6.561 GHz.

Wait, but that's for TE10. Now, what about the next higher-order mode? The next mode after TE10 would be either TE20 or TE11, depending on which has a lower cutoff frequency.

Wait, let's compute their cutoff frequencies.

For TE20: m=2, n=0.

f_c2 = (3e8 / 2 ) * sqrt( (2/0.02286)^2 + 0 )

= (3e8 / 2 ) * (2 / 0.02286 )

= (3e8 / 2 ) * (87.48 ) [since 2 / 0.02286≈ 87.48 ]

So 3e8 /2 = 1.5e8.

1.5e8 * 87.48 ≈ Let's calculate 1.5e8 * 87.48.

1.5 * 87.48 = 131.22.

So 131.22e8 Hz = 13.122 GHz.

Now, for TE11 mode: m=1, n=1.

f_c3 = (3e8 / 2 ) * sqrt( (1/0.02286)^2 + (1/0.01016)^2 )

Compute each term:

1/a = 1/0.02286 ≈ 43.74 m^-1.

1/b = 1/0.01016 ≈ 98.36 m^-1.

So (43.74)^2 = approx (43.74)^2 = Let's compute 40^2=1600, 3.74^2≈14, 2*40*3.74= 298.4. So (43.74)^2 ≈ 1600 + 298.4 +14 = 1912.4.

Similarly, (98.36)^2 = approx (100)^2 is 10,000, but 98.36 is about 1.64 less. So (98.36)^2= (100 -1.64)^2 = 10000 - 2*100*1.64 + (1.64)^2 = 10000 - 328 + 2.69= 9674.69.

So sqrt(1912.4 + 9674.69) = sqrt(11587.09) ≈ 107.65.

So f_c3 = (3e8 / 2 ) * 107.65.

3e8 is 300,000,000. Divided by 2 is 150,000,000.

150e6 * 107.65 ≈ 150e6 *100=15e9, 150e6 *7.65=1.1475e9.

So total approx 16.1475e9 Hz, which is 16.1475 GHz.

Wait, but wait, TE20's cutoff is about 13.122 GHz, which is lower than TE11's 16.147 GHz. So the next higher mode after TE10 is TE20, since 13 GHz is lower than 16 GHz.

Wait, but wait, wait, wait. Because the dominant mode is TE10, but the next mode is the one with the next lowest cutoff frequency, which could be TE20 or TE01, or TE11. Since TE10's cutoff is 6.56 GHz, then TE20 is 13.12 GHz, which is next. TE01 would have a cutoff of (3e8 / 2) * (1/0.01016 ), which is (3e8 / 2 ) * 98.36.

3e8 m/s is 300 million, divided by 2 is 150 million. 150e6 * 98.36 ≈ 14.754e9 Hz, which is about 14.75 GHz. So TE01's cutoff is higher than TE20's. So the next mode after TE10 is TE20, with cutoff at 13.12 GHz.

Wait, but then part (a) of the problem asks for the cutoff of the dominant mode and the next higher-order mode. So dominant is TE10 at ≈6.56 GHz, next is TE20 at ≈13.12 GHz.

Wait, but I should check my calculations again because the options don't exactly match 6.56 GHz and 13.12 GHz. Let's see the options:

Option J is 6.56 GHz and 13.1 GHz, which looks close. Let me see if the calculations are precise.

Wait, perhaps I made approximations. Let me compute more accurately.

Calculating TE10 cutoff:

a=0.9 in = 0.02286 m.

f_c10 = c/(2a) * sqrt(1^2 + 0^2) = (3e8 m/s) / (2 * 0.02286 m) )

So 3e8 / (2 * 0.02286) = 3e8 / 0.04572 ≈ let's calculate this.

3e8 / 0.04572 = 3e8 / 4.572e-2 = (3 / 4.572) * 1e10.

3 / 4.572 ≈ 0.6568.

So 0.6568e10 Hz = 6.568 GHz, which is approximately 6.57 GHz. But looking at the options, option J is 6.56 GHz, so that's very close.

Now TE20:

f_c20 = c/(2a) * sqrt( (2)^2 + 0 ) = (3e8) / (2 * 0.02286 ) * 2.

Wait, let's compute it correctly.

f_c20 = (3e8 / 2 ) * sqrt( (2/0.02286)^2 + 0 )

Which is (3e8 / 2 ) * (2 / 0.02286 )

= (3e8 * 2 ) / (2 * 0.02286 )

The 2s cancel, so (3e8 ) / 0.02286 ≈ 3e8 / 0.02286.

3e8 is 300,000,000.

300,000,000 / 0.02286 ≈ Let's compute 300e6 / 0.02286 = 300e6 * (1/0.02286) ≈ 300e6 *43.74 ≈ 300e6 *43.74.

Wait, 300e6 is 3e8, so 3e8 *43.74e-2 (Wait, 1/0.02286 is approx 43.74, which is 4.374e1.)

Wait, perhaps better to compute 3e8 / 0.02286 = ?

0.02286 meters is 2.286e-2 m.

So 3e8 / 2.286e-2 = (3 / 2.286 )e10.

3/2.286 ≈ 1.313.

So 1.313e10 Hz = 13.13 GHz. So the cutoff for TE20 is approximately 13.13 GHz.

So part (a) is TE10 at ~6.56 GHz, TE20 at ~13.13 GHz.

Now part (b): attenuation factor for the next higher-order mode (TE20) at a frequency midway between the two cutoffs.

Midway between 6.56 and 13.13 would be (6.56 +13.13)/2 = 19.69/2 ≈9.845 GHz.

Wait, no, wait, the next higher-order mode after TE10 is TE20, so the two cutoff frequencies are 6.56 GHz (TE10) and 13.13 GHz (TE20). So midway between them is (6.56 +13.13)/2 = approx 9.845 GHz.

Wait, but the attenuation factor applies when the frequency is below the cutoff frequency. Because attenuation occurs when the operating frequency is below the cutoff frequency for that mode. Wait, but wait, the next higher mode's cutoff is at 13.13 GHz, so if the operating frequency is above 13.13 GHz, the TE20 mode can propagate. But in this case, the frequency is 9.845 GHz, which is below 13.13 GHz, so the TE20 mode would be evanescent (attenuated). But wait, the problem says "attenuation factor associated with the next higher-order mode at a frequency midway between the two cutoff frequencies."

Wait, but the two cutoff frequencies are for the two modes. Wait, no, the two cutoff frequencies are for the dominant mode and the next higher mode, which are TE10 and TE20. So the midway frequency is (6.56 +13.13)/2 = 9.845 GHz.

So at 9.845 GHz, the TE20 mode is operating below its cutoff (since 9.845 <13.13), so it's attenuated.

The attenuation factor (attenuation constant) for TE modes is given by:

α = (1/√(μ ε)) * sqrt( (m π /a )^2 + (n π /b )^2 - (ω μ ε )^2 )

But another expression is:

α = (π√(μ ε)) * sqrt( (ω_c / ω )^2 -1 )

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

α = (1/√(μ ε)) ) * sqrt( (ω_c)^2 - ω^2 )

Wait, no, more accurately, the attenuation constant for a waveguide operating below cutoff is:

α = (sqrt( (ω_c)^2 - ω^2 )) / (c)

But wait, let me get the exact formula right. For TE modes, the attenuation constant is:

α = (1/√(μ ε)) ) * sqrt( (ω_c)^2 - ω^2 )

But since μ ε = 1/c^2, 1/√(μ ε) = c.

So α = c * sqrt( (ω_c^2 - ω^2) )

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again.

The general expression for the attenuation constant is:

α = (sqrt( ( (m π / a )^2 + (n π /b )^2 ) ) ) * √(μ ε ) * sqrt(1 - (ω/ω_c )^2 )

Wait, no. Let me look it up in my notes (well, imagine I'm doing that). The attenuation constant α for TE modes is given by:

α = ( ( (m π /a )^2 + (n π /b )^2 )^(1/2) ) * sqrt(μ ε) * sqrt(1 - (f/f_c)^2 )

But wait, sqrt(μ ε) is 1/c. So:

α = ( (sqrt( (m/a)^2 + (n/b)^2 ) ) * π ) * (1/c) ) * sqrt(1 - (f/f_c)^2 )

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula:

For a waveguide, when the operating frequency f is below the cutoff frequency f_c, the attenuation constant α is given by:

α = (π√(μ ε)) * sqrt( (f_c / f )^2 -1 )

But I'm getting myself confused. Let me approach it differently. The phase constant β becomes imaginary below cutoff, and the attenuation constant α is given by:

α = (1/√(μ ε)) ) * sqrt( ( (m π / a )^2 + (n π /b )^2 ) - (ω μ ε )^2 )

Wait, but ω is 2π f. Hmm, perhaps it's better to express everything in terms of f and f_c.

Alternatively, α can be written as:

α = (π / c) * sqrt( (f_c)^2 - f^2 )

Wait, let me check the units. α should be in Np/m. Let me see.

So, if I have f_c in Hz, and f in Hz, then (f_c^2 - f^2 ) would be in Hz^2. Taking the square root gives Hz. Then π/c (c in m/s), so (s/m) * Hz (which is 1/s) ) gives 1/m. So units would be 1/m, but α is in Np/m, which is dimensionless per meter. So that formula can't be right because it would have units of 1/m, but to get Np/m, which is unitless per meter, so perhaps the formula includes a factor that's unitless.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

α = (π / (c)) * sqrt( (f_c)^2 - f^2 )

But that would have units of (1/(m/s)) * sqrt(Hz^2) ) → (s/m) * Hz → (s/m)*(1/s) )= 1/m → which is correct for α in 1/m, but we need to convert to Np/m. Since 1 Np = ln(e) ≈ 2.3026, so 1/m = (1/2.3026) Np/m. Hmm, that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of c somewhere.

Wait, another approach: The cutoff occurs when the frequency is such that the guide wavelength is infinite. Below cutoff, the wave becomes evanescent, and the fields decay exponentially. The attenuation constant α is given by:

α = (π√(μ ε)) * sqrt( (f_c / f )^2 - 1 )

Since μ=μ0 and ε=ε0 for air, √(μ ε)=1/c.

So:

α = (π / c) * sqrt( (f_c / f )^2 -1 )

Now, f is 9.845 GHz, and f_c is 13.13 GHz.

So let's compute f_c / f = 13.13 / 9.845 ≈ 1.334.

So (f_c/f)^2 = approx (1.334)^2 ≈ 1.779.

Then (1.779 -1 ) = 0.779.

sqrt(0.779) ≈ 0.8825.

So
