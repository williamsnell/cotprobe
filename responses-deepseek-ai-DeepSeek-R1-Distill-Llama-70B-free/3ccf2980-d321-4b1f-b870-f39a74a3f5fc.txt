Okay, so I've got this PL/I question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about how PL/I assigns default attributes to variables when explicit declarations aren't provided. There are five variables given, each with different parts, and I need to figure out their attributes based on default rules.

First, let me recall what I know about PL/I. PL/I is a programming language that's quite flexible with variable declarations. If you don't declare a variable explicitly, the compiler tries to infer its type and other attributes based on the context and certain default rules.

So the variables given are:
a) PERCENT (1:8)
b) AMOUNT FIXED
c) NUMBER COMPLEX
d) TOTAL BINARY
e) INCANT

I think I remember that in PL/I, the way you declare variables can affect their type, precision, and other attributes. For example, the presence of certain keywords like FIXED, FLOAT, COMPLEX, or BINARY can influence the variable's type.

Let's tackle each variable one by one.

Starting with a) PERCENT(1:8). The syntax here looks like a substring, but wait, in PL/I, when you have something like variable(1:n), I think it's an array, right? But if it's just a scalar variable, maybe that's not the case. Hmm, wait no, PERCENT(1:8) would be a reference to a substring if PERCENT is a string variable. But if PERCENT hasn't been declared, the compiler would look at this reference to determine its attributes.

Wait, in PL/I, when you use a variable in a certain way, the compiler infers its type. For example, if you write something like X(1:5), the compiler would assume X is a character string of sufficient length. So in this case, PERCENT(1:8) suggests that PERCENT is a character string variable. The (1:8) indicates a substring, so the variable is probably a character string, and the length would be at least 8. But wait, the default for a variable declared as a string without explicit length would be 1, but since it's being used as (1:8), the length must be at least 8. So the compiler would assign it a length of 8. So PERCENT would be a character string of length 8. But looking at the options, the first option for a) in each choice starts with PERCENT(1:something) DEC, REAL, etc. Wait, that can't be right because PERCENT is a string, so maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps the variables are declared as varying strings or something else. Alternatively, maybe the question is not about strings but about other attributes like fixed or float.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in PL/I, when you have a variable name followed by a parenthesized expression, like PERCENT(1:8), it's treated as an array. But without a declaration, the compiler would assume it's a one-dimensional array. So PERCENT would be an array of some type, perhaps numeric, with 8 elements. But wait, that doesn't fit with the options presented.

Wait, looking at the options, for part a, the options have PERCENT(1:8) DEC, REAL, etc. Wait, no, for example, option A for a) says PERCENT(1:8) DEC, REAL, FLOAT(6). So that suggests that PERCENT is a decimal floating-point variable with a precision of 6. But wait, how does that make sense when using (1:8)?

Hmm, maybe I'm confusing the syntax. Alternatively, perhaps PERCENT(1:8) is a substring operation, implying PERCENT is a character string of length at least 8. So the variable would be declared as CHAR(8), but the options don't mention CHAR, they mention DEC, REAL, etc. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again about the default rules. In PL/I, if a variable is used in an expression that suggests it's a certain type, the compiler assigns it accordingly. For example, if you have a variable used in a context that requires it to be numeric, then it's declared as a fixed or float. But if it's used as a string, it's a char.

Wait, perhaps the variables in the question are not declared, so the compiler infers their type based on their usage elsewhere in the program. But in this question, we don't have that context. So perhaps the question is testing the default variable attributes based on the variable's name and any modifiers provided.

Wait, maybe the variables are being declared with certain attributes. For example, "FIXED" would make it a fixed-point (integer) variable, "FLOAT" would make it floating-point, etc.

Let me go through each variable again.

a) PERCENT (1:8). Hmm, the (1:8) is confusing me. Wait, perhaps it's a variable with a subscript, implying it's an array. But without more context, perhaps the base variable is a decimal floating-point. Or maybe the (1:8) is part of the declaration. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the syntax. Maybe it's PERCENT being declared with a certain precision and scale. Like, PERCENT is a decimal float with a certain number of digits.

Wait, I think I remember that in PL/I, when you declare a variable without specifying the type, the compiler uses certain default rules. For example, if the variable is used in a way that suggests it's a decimal, it might be declared as a fixed decimal. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the variables are using certain keywords that determine their type. For example:

b) AMOUNT FIXED: So the keyword FIXED would imply that AMOUNT is a fixed-point (integer) variable. So its type would be FIXED. But what's the default size? I think the default for FIXED is 18 bits, which is 6 decimal digits (since 2^18 is about 262144, so 6 digits). Or wait, maybe it's 31 bits for fixed, which is 9 decimal digits. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, I think in PL/I, the default for a FIXED variable is the smallest number of decimal digits that can hold the values the variable will take. But without any further info, perhaps the default is FIXED(15) or something. Wait, perhaps when you declare FIXED without a size, it's 15 decimal digits? Or maybe it's machine-dependent. Hmm, this is getting tricky.

Similarly, for c) NUMBER COMPLEX: The keyword COMPLEX would make it a complex number. The default size for COMPLEX is typically the same as REAL, which is 4 bytes ( FLOAT(4) ), but I'm not certain.

d) TOTAL BINARY: BINARY would indicate binary data, which I think is a bit string. But in PL/I, perhaps it's treated as a BIT variable, which is a bit string. But the options are showing BINARY REAL, which is confusing because BINARY might refer to fixed-point binary, but perhaps it's being treated as a real number in binary format. Alternatively, maybe BINARY is a type where the variable is treated as a fixed-point number in binary, but the default size would be the machine's word size, perhaps 32 bits, which is FLOAT(4). But I'm not sure.

e) INCANT: This variable has no modifiers, so the default would be FIXED. Because in PL/I, if you don't specify, the variable is assumed to be FIXED. But wait, no, I think the default is actually FIXED if it's not specified, but perhaps it's better to check. Wait, no, I think the default is actually that variables are assumed to be FIXED if they are not declared otherwise. So INCANT would be a FIXED variable. What's the default size for FIXED? I think it's 18 decimal digits, but that might not be accurate. Alternatively, the default size could be 15 decimal digits, which is 32 bits perhaps.

Wait, but looking at the options, for example, option E for e) says INCANT FIXED(14) BIN, REAL. So BIN might be binary, but that's conflicting. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me think about each part and the possible options.

Starting with a) PERCENT(1:8):

I'm a bit stuck on this one. The (1:8) part could be an array subscript, implying PERCENT is an array. But without a declaration, the compiler would infer it's an array of some type. Alternatively, perhaps the (1:8) is part of a declaration, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's a decimal floating-point number with a certain scale. For example, (1:8) might be the precision, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the variable is of type DECIMAL with a certain number of digits.

Wait, perhaps the variable is being declared as a decimal with a certain number of digits. For example, if it's PERCENT(1:8), maybe it's a DECIMAL with 8 digits, so scale 0, making it a fixed decimal.

But I'm not certain. Let's move on and perhaps come back.

b) AMOUNT FIXED: Since it's declared as FIXED, it's a fixed-point variable. The default size for FIXED is machine-dependent, but I think it's typically 18 decimal digits. Wait, no, 18 bits would be 2^18 = 262,144 which is about 6 digits. So perhaps 6 digits, scale 0. So the attributes would be FIXED(6) DEC.

But looking at the options, for example, option A for b) says AMOUNT FIXED (5) DEC, REAL. Wait, that can't be right because FIXED is an integer, but REAL is a float. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps when you declare a variable as FIXED, it's a decimal integer, so it's a fixed-point number. So AMOUNT would be FIXED, and the default size is 15 digits? Or 18 bits, which is 6 digits. So perhaps the size is 5, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the default for a FIXED variable without a specified size is 15 decimal digits, which would be represented in 32 bits. So the size would be 15. Let me check the options. For example, option A's b) is FIXED(5), option B's b) is FIXED(9), etc. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the default depends on the usage. If a variable is used in arithmetic operations, it might be treated as a float. But without that context, it's hard to say.

Moving on to c) NUMBER COMPLEX: The keyword COMPLEX would make it a complex number. The default size for a complex number is the same as REAL, which is typically 4 bytes (FLOAT(4)). So COMPLEX would imply a complex number with two REAL(4) components. So the attributes would be COMPLEX, with each part being FLOAT(4).

d) TOTAL BINARY: BINARY in PL/I usually refers to binary data, perhaps a bit string. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, BINARY could imply a fixed-point binary number, but that's more of a low-level type. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and should be BINARY as a type, but the options are showing BINARY REAL, which is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps BINARY is being treated as a fixed-point number with a certain size, like 32 bits (FLOAT(4)).

e) INCANT: No modifiers, so the default is FIXED. What's the default size? I think it's 15 decimal digits, which would be FIXED(15). But looking at the options, each option has INCANT with a different size. For example, option A says FIXED(15), option E says FIXED(14), etc.

Wait, perhaps the default for a variable without any declaration is FIXED with a certain size, maybe 15 digits. So INCANT would be FIXED(15) DEC.

Now, to put this all together, I need to match each variable's attributes to what the options provide.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A:
a) PERCENT(1:8) DEC, REAL, FLOAT(6)
b) AMOUNT FIXED(5) DEC, REAL
c) NUMBER FIXED(5) DEC COMPLEX
d) TOTAL FLOAT(21) BINARY REAL
e) INCANT FIXED(15) BIN, REAL

Hmm, that doesn't seem to fit. For example, variable c) is declared as COMPLEX, but option A says NUMBER is FIXED(5) DEC COMPLEX. Wait, that's not correct because COMPLEX is a separate type.

Option E:
a) PERCENT(1:9) DEC, REAL, FLOAT(5)
b) AMOUNT FIXED(4) DEC, REAL
c) NUMBER FIXED(6) DEC COMPLEX
d) TOTAL FLOAT(20) BINARY REAL
e) INCANT FIXED(14) BIN, REAL

Hmm, not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on each variable's type and size.

For a) PERCENT(1:8): If it's a string, it would be CHAR(8), but the options don't have that. So maybe it's a numeric variable. The (1:8) could indicate a scale and precision. Wait, maybe it's a decimal float with precision 8, so FLOAT(8). But the options have a) as PERCENT(1:8) DEC, REAL, FLOAT(6) in option A. So perhaps it's a decimal float, which is REAL, with FLOAT(6) meaning 6 digits of precision.

Wait, perhaps the variable is a real (floating-point) with a certain precision. So PERCENT would be a REAL, with FLOAT(6) precision, which is 6 decimal digits.

b) AMOUNT FIXED: So it's a fixed-point variable. The default size might be 15 decimal digits, but perhaps it's smaller. Looking at the options, option A has FIXED(5), option E has FIXED(4). I'm not sure.

c) NUMBER COMPLEX: So it's a complex number, which in PL/I is two REAL numbers. The default size for COMPLEX is the same as REAL, which is FLOAT(4). So the attributes would be COMPLEX with each component as FLOAT(4).

d) TOTAL BINARY: BINARY might indicate a binary number, perhaps FLOAT(4) since that's common. So TOTAL would be a FLOAT(4) BINARY REAL? Not sure, but looking at the options, for d) in option E, it's FLOAT(20) BINARY REAL, which seems too large.

e) INCANT: Default is FIXED. Size? If not specified, perhaps it's 15 digits. So FIXED(15) DEC.

Looking at the options, which option has e) as FIXED(15)?

Looking through the options:

Option A: e) INCANT FIXED(15) BIN, REAL → So size 15, but BIN and REAL don't make sense for a FIXED variable.

Option B: e) INCANT FIXED(11) BIN, REAL → No.

Option C: e) INCANT FIXED(13) BIN, REAL → No.

Option D: e) INCANT FIXED(18) BIN, REAL → 18 seems too big.

Option E: e) INCANT FIXED(14) BIN, REAL → 14.

Option F: e) INCANT FIXED(16) BIN, REAL → No.

Option G: e) INCANT FIXED(12) BIN, REAL → No.

Option H: e) INCANT FIXED(10) BIN, REAL → No.

Option I: e) INCANT FIXED(17) BIN, REAL → No.

Option J: e) INCANT FIXED(19) BIN, REAL → No.

Wait, none of the options have e) as FIXED(15) except option A and perhaps none. Wait, option A's e) is FIXED(15), but it says BIN, REAL, which might not fit.

Wait, perhaps the default for a variable without a type is FIXED, but if it's used in a certain way, it's treated differently. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Another approach: Let's think about each variable and what the default would be.

a) PERCENT(1:8): If this is a variable being used as a decimal float, perhaps the (1:8) refers to the scale and precision. Wait, in PL/I, a decimal number can have a precision and scale. For example, DECIMAL(5,2) would mean 5 digits with 2 after the decimal. But if it's PERCENT(1:8), maybe it's a substring, but that would imply a CHAR type. Alternatively, perhaps it's a decimal number with a certain number of digits.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the default rules for PL/I variables.

From what I remember, in PL/I, if you don't declare a variable, the compiler infers its type and attributes based on how it's used. For example, if a variable is used in an arithmetic operation, it's considered numeric. If it's used in a string operation, it's considered a string.

But without any usage context, the compiler would apply default rules. For example, if the variable is used in a context that requires it to be a string, it's a string. Otherwise, it's numeric.

Wait, perhaps that's not accurate. I think in PL/I, if you don't declare the variable at all, it's an error unless it's declared in a surrounding scope or via a default. But in this question, the variables are being declared with certain attributes, perhaps implicitly.

Wait, perhaps the variables are being declared with certain types based on their modifiers.

Let me think again for each variable.

a) PERCENT (1:8): If PERCENT is a variable and (1:8) is part of its declaration, perhaps it's an array. But without more info, maybe it's a scalar. Alternatively, perhaps the (1:8) is indicating a certain precision or scale. Alternatively, perhaps the variable is a decimal with 8 digits. So PERCENT would be a DECIMAL(8) variable. But looking at the options, the a) parts have PERCENT with attributes like DEC, REAL, FLOAT(6) or similar.

Wait, perhaps the (1:8) is part of a substring operation, implying PERCENT is a CHAR(8) variable. But the options don't have CHAR; they have DEC, REAL, etc. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the (1:8) is part of the variable's name, but that seems unlikely. So perhaps PERCENT is a decimal floating-point variable with a certain precision.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on a), so perhaps I should move on and see if the other parts can help.

b) AMOUNT FIXED: So it's a fixed-point variable. The default size for FIXED is 15 decimal digits, I think. So AMOUNT would be FIXED(15) DEC.

But looking at the options, for example, option A's b)
