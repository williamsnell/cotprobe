Question:

A 15-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents because of a 2-hour history of confusion and agitation. He also has had fever, headache, stiff neck, and vomiting since he returned from summer camp 2 days ago. His parents say he does not use illicit drugs. On arrival, he is combative and there is evidence of hallucinations. His temperature is 40°C (104°F), pulse is 80/min, respirations are 17/min, and blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg. A lumbar puncture is performed. Results of cerebrospinal fluid analysis show cysts and trophozoites. The most likely portal of pathogen entry into this patient's central nervous system is which of the following?

Options:

A: Mastoid sinus
B: Frontal sinus
C: Nasal cavity
D: Olfactory nerve
E: Vertebral canal
F: Oral cavity
G: Optic nerve
H: Eustachian tube
I: Auditory canal
J: Facial nerve

Okay, so I've got this medical question here about a 15-year-old boy with some serious symptoms. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The patient was brought to the ED with confusion, agitation, fever, headache, stiff neck, and vomiting. These symptoms started after he returned from summer camp two days ago. His parents say he doesn't use illicit drugs, so that's probably a hint to look for something else, maybe an infection.

On arrival, he's combative and hallucinating. His vital signs: temp is 40°C, which is pretty high, pulse 80, respirations 17, BP 100/70. So the fever is significant, and the other symptoms suggest maybe meningitis because of the stiff neck and headache.

They did a lumbar puncture, and the CSF analysis shows cysts and trophozoites. Hmm, okay, so what causes that? I remember that in CSF, seeing cysts and trophozoites is indicative of Naegleria fowleri infection, which causes primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). That's a rare but serious condition.

So the question is about the portal of entry. How does Naegleria get into the CNS? From what I recall, Naegleria is a free-living ameba found in warm water. It infects humans when contaminated water enters through the nasal passages. The ameba then travels up the olfactory nerve to reach the brain. So the entry point is the nasal cavity, and the pathway is via the olfactory nerve.

Looking at the options:

C: Nasal cavity
D: Olfactory nerve

Wait, the question is about the portal of entry. So the pathogen enters through the nasal cavity. The olfactory nerve is the route it uses to get into the CNS, but the actual entry is through the nose.

So the correct answer would be C: Nasal cavity.

Let me double-check. Naegleria infections typically occur when someone swims in warm, stagnant water, like a lake or poorly chlorinated pool. The amoeba enters through the nose, then migrates along the olfactory nerve to the brain. So the entry is the nasal cavity, option C.

The patient is a 15-year-old boy presenting with symptoms of confusion, agitation, fever, headache, stiff neck, and vomiting, which are suggestive of meningitis. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis reveals cysts and trophozoites, which is characteristic of Naegleria fowleri infection, a cause of primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). This amoeba is commonly acquired through exposure to warm, contaminated water, entering the body via the nasal cavity. From there, it migrates along the olfactory nerve to the central nervous system. Since the question specifically asks for the portal of entry, the correct answer is the nasal cavity.

Answer: C
