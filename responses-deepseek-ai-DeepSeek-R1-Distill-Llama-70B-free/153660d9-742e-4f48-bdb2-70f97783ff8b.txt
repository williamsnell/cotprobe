Okay, so I have this probability problem to solve. The question is about finding the density function of Y, given that Y equals X squared, and X has a certain given density function. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that when we have a transformation of variables like Y = g(X), we can find the density of Y by using the method of transformation. The general formula I think is h(y) = f(g⁻¹(y)) * |d/dy [g⁻¹(y)]|, right? So I'll need to apply this here.

The given density function for X is f(x) = 1/(π(1 + x²)) for all real x. That looks familiar—it's the standard Cauchy distribution, which is symmetric around zero. So X can take any real value, positive or negative.

Now Y is defined as X squared. That means Y is always non-negative because squaring any real number gives a positive result or zero. So Y ranges from 0 to infinity.

To find the density h(y) of Y, I need to find the inverse transformation. Since Y = X², solving for X gives X = sqrt(Y) and X = -sqrt(Y). But since Y is just the square, for each y > 0, there are two corresponding x values: positive and negative square roots. That's important because when we change variables, we might have multiple branches contributing to the density.

So the inverse functions are x = sqrt(y) and x = -sqrt(y). Now, I need to compute the derivative of x with respect to y for each inverse function.

Let's calculate the absolute value of the derivative. For x = sqrt(y), dx/dy is (1/(2*sqrt(y))). The same derivative applies for x = -sqrt(y) because the derivative of -sqrt(y) is -1/(2*sqrt(y)), but taking absolute value gives the same 1/(2*sqrt(y)).

Now, applying the transformation formula: h(y) = sum over all x that map to y of [f(x) * |dx/dy|].

Since there are two x values (sqrt(y) and -sqrt(y)) that map to each y, we sum their contributions. But looking at f(x), since it's symmetric around zero, f(sqrt(y)) and f(-sqrt(y)) are the same. So each term in the sum is [f(sqrt(y)) * (1/(2*sqrt(y)))], and since the two terms are identical, we have 2 * [f(sqrt(y)) * (1/(2*sqrt(y))))].

Wait, let me clarify that. The formula would be f(g⁻¹(y)) multiplied by the absolute derivative, but since there are two points mapping to y, we add the contributions. So it's [f(sqrt(y)) * (1/(2*sqrt(y)))] + [f(-sqrt(y)) * (1/(2*sqrt(y)))].

But since f is even (f(x) = f(-x)), this simplifies to 2 * f(sqrt(y)) * (1/(2*sqrt(y))) ), which simplifies further to f(sqrt(y)) / sqrt(y).

So substituting f(sqrt(y)) into that, f(sqrt(y)) is 1/(π(1 + (sqrt(y))²)). Since (sqrt(y))² is y, that becomes 1/(π(1 + y)).

So putting it all together, h(y) = [1/(π(1 + y))] * (1/sqrt(y)) ) * 1/2? Wait, no. Wait, let me check again. Oh wait, no, because in the previous step, when I added the two terms, each had a 1/(2 sqrt(y)) factor. So 2*(1/(2 sqrt(y))) )= 1/sqrt(y). So h(y) = [1/(π(1 + y))] * (1/sqrt(y)).

Wait, let me make sure. Let's go through it again.

f(x) = 1/(π(1 + x²)), and for Y = X², the transformation is x = sqrt(y) and x = -sqrt(y). The derivative dx/dy is 1/(2 sqrt(y)) for each branch. Since both branches contribute, we sum the two. So h(y) = f(sqrt(y)) * (1/(2 sqrt(y))) + f(-sqrt(y)) * (1/(2 sqrt(y))).

But because f(sqrt(y)) = f(-sqrt(y)) = 1/(π(1 + y)), each term is [1/(π(1 + y))] * [1/(2 sqrt(y))]. So adding them together gives 2 * [1/(π(1 + y)) * 1/(2 sqrt(y)))] = [1/(π(1 + y))] * (1/sqrt(y)).

Wait, that would be h(y) = [1/(π(1 + y))] * (1/sqrt(y)).

Wait, but looking at the answer options, I don't see that exact form. Let me check the options again.

Option B says h(y) = [2/(π sqrt(y)(1 + y))] for y>0. Wait, that's 2/(π sqrt(y)(1 + y)). Hmm, but what I have is 1/(π sqrt(y)(1 + y))).

Wait, did I miss a factor of 2 somewhere? Let me think again.

Wait, when I have Y = X², and X can be positive or negative, each contributes a term. So the sum is 2 * [f(sqrt(y)) * (1/(2 sqrt(y)))]. Because each term is f(x) * |dx/dy|, and since both x = sqrt(y) and x=-sqrt(y) contribute, each with 1/(2 sqrt(y)).

So 2 * [f(sqrt(y)) * (1/(2 sqrt(y)))] = f(sqrt(y)) * (1/sqrt(y)).

Yes, that's correct. So h(y) = [1/(π(1 + y))] * (1/sqrt(y)).

Wait, but looking back, the options given:

Option B: [2/(π sqrt(y)(1 + y))] for y>0.

Option G: [1/(π sqrt(y)(1 + y))] for y>0.

Hmm, so according to my calculation, the correct expression would be 1/(π sqrt(y)(1 + y)), which would match option G.

Wait, but let me check the initial steps again. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the transformation.

Alternate approach: using cumulative distribution functions.

The CDF approach: For Y = X², P(Y ≤ y) = P(X² ≤ y) = P(-sqrt(y) ≤ X ≤ sqrt(y)).

So the CDF of Y, Fy(y) = Fx(sqrt(y)) - Fx(-sqrt(y)), where Fx is the CDF of X.

Then, the density h(y) is the derivative of Fy(y) with respect to y.

So h(y) = d/dy [Fx(sqrt(y)) - Fx(-sqrt(y))] = f(sqrt(y)) * (1/(2 sqrt(y))) + f(-sqrt(y)) * (1/(2 sqrt(y))) ).

Again, because the derivative of sqrt(y) is 1/(2 sqrt(y)), and the derivative of -sqrt(y) is -1/(2 sqrt(y)), but when applying the chain rule with the CDF's derivative (which gives f(x)), we get f(sqrt(y))*(1/(2 sqrt(y))) + f(-sqrt(y))*(1/(2 sqrt(y))).

Since f is even, the two terms are equal, so this becomes 2 * [f(sqrt(y)) * (1/(2 sqrt(y)))) ] = [f(sqrt(y)) / sqrt(y)].

Which is the same as before. So h(y) = [1/(π(1 + y))] * (1/sqrt(y)).

Looking at the options, that's option G: [1 / (π sqrt(y)(1 + y))] for y>0.

So the correct answer should be option B if I made a mistake and included an extra factor of 2, but according to this, it's option G.

Wait, wait. Let me check my calculations again. Did I forget to include the factor of 2 somewhere?

Wait, when Y = X², the inverse mapping is X = sqrt(Y) and X = -sqrt(Y). So when you compute h(y), you have to account for both possibilities. So the density is f(sqrt(y)) * |d/dy sqrt(y)| + f(-sqrt(y)) * |d/dy (-sqrt(y))|.

Which is f(sqrt(y)) * (1/(2 sqrt(y))) + f(-sqrt(y)) * (1/(2 sqrt(y))).

But since f(sqrt(y)) = f(-sqrt(y)) because f is even, this is 2 * [f(sqrt(y)) * (1/(2 sqrt(y)))] = f(sqrt(y)) * (1/sqrt(y)).

Which gives h(y) = [1/(π(1 + y))] * (1/sqrt(y)).

So looking at the options:

Option B: [2/(π sqrt(y)(1 + y))]

Option G: [1/(π sqrt(y)(1 + y))]

So according to this, the correct answer is option G. But wait, looking back at the initial problem, the options are labeled A to J. Let me check again.

The options are:

A: [2 / (π(1 + sqrt(y)))] for y > 0.

B: [2 / (π sqrt(y)(1 + y))] for y > 0.

C: [1 / (π(1 + y²))] for y > 0.

D: [1 / (2 π(1 + sqrt(y)))] for y > 0.

E: [1 / (2 π(1 + y²))] for y > 0.

F: [e^(-y) / (2 π sqrt(1 + y))] for y > 0.

G: [1 / (π sqrt(y)(1 + y))] for y > 0.

H: [1 / (π(2 + sqrt(y)))] for y > 0.

I: [1 / (2 π sqrt(y)(1 + y))] for y > 0.

So option G matches h(y) = [1/(π sqrt(y)(1 + y))] for y>0.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the correct answer would have a 2 in the numerator. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the transformation approach.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute this using Jacobians. The transformation is Y = X², so X can be written as sqrt(Y) or -sqrt(Y). So for each y, there are two x's: x1 = sqrt(y) and x2 = -sqrt(y). The density h(y) is the sum over all x that map to y of f(x) * |dx/dy|.

So h(y) = f(x1) * |dx1/dy| + f(x2) * |dx2/dy|.

Since x1 = sqrt(y) → dx1/dy = 1/(2 sqrt(y)).

x2 = -sqrt(y) → dx2/dy = -1/(2 sqrt(y)), but taking absolute value gives 1/(2 sqrt(y)).

So h(y) = f(sqrt(y)) * (1/(2 sqrt(y))) + f(-sqrt(y)) * (1/(2 sqrt(y))).

But since f is even, f(sqrt(y)) = f(-sqrt(y)).

So h(y) = 2 * [f(sqrt(y)) * (1/(2 sqrt(y)))] = [f(sqrt(y)) / sqrt(y)].

So substituting f(sqrt(y)) = 1/(π(1 + (sqrt(y))²)) = 1/(π(1 + y)).

Thus, h(y) = [1/(π(1 + y))] * (1/sqrt(y)).

Which is 1/(π sqrt(y)(1 + y)).

So this matches option G.

But wait, I thought earlier that option B had 2 in the numerator. Let me check option B again.

Option B: [2 / (π sqrt(y)(1 + y))] for y>0.

Ah, so option B has 2 in the numerator, whereas according to the calculation, it's 1. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, could there be a miscalculation? Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the density of Y = X² when X has density f(x). There's a standard formula for this.

If X has density f(x), then Y = X² has density h(y) = [f(sqrt(y)) + f(-sqrt(y))] * (1/(2 sqrt(y))).

But since f is even, f(sqrt(y)) = f(-sqrt(y)), so h(y) = 2 f(sqrt(y)) * (1/(2 sqrt(y))) ) = f(sqrt(y)) / sqrt(y).

Which again gives h(y) = [1/(π(1 + y))] * (1/sqrt(y)) = 1/(π sqrt(y)(1 + y)).

So that's option G.

But looking at the options, option B is 2/(π sqrt(y)(1 + y)), which would be twice what I have here. So perhaps I missed a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, could it be that in the initial steps, the sum of the two terms gives 2 f(sqrt(y)) * (1/(2 sqrt(y))) ), which would be f(sqrt(y)) / sqrt(y). So no, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the original f(x) is [1/(π(1 + x²))], which is correct for the Cauchy distribution. So when I plug in x = sqrt(y), I get 1/(π(1 + y)).

So h(y) = [1/(π(1 + y))] * (1/sqrt(y)).

Which is 1/(π sqrt(y)(1 + y)).

So the correct option is G.

But wait, looking at the options, option B has 2 in the numerator. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another thought: the standard Cauchy distribution has f(x) = 1/(π(1 + x²)). When Y = X², the density is h(y) = [f(sqrt(y)) + f(-sqrt(y))] * (1/(2 sqrt(y))).

But since f(sqrt(y)) = f(-sqrt(y)) = 1/(π(1 + y)), adding them gives 2/(π(1 + y)).

Then multiply by 1/(2 sqrt(y)):

h(y) = [2/(π(1 + y))] * [1/(2 sqrt(y))] = [1/(π(1 + y))] * [1/sqrt(y)].

So that's the same result as before, 1/(π sqrt(y)(1 + y)).

So that's option G.

Wait, so why does option B have 2 in the numerator? Maybe I'm mixing up something else.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute the integral of h(y) from 0 to infinity to check if it equals 1.

For option G: h(y) = 1/(π sqrt(y)(1 + y)).

Integral from y=0 to ∞: ∫ [1/(π sqrt(y)(1 + y))] dy.

Let me make substitution: Let t = sqrt(y), so y = t², dy = 2t dt.

Then the integral becomes ∫ [1/(π t (1 + t²))] * 2t dt from t=0 to ∞.

The t terms cancel, giving ∫ [2/(π (1 + t²))] dt from 0 to ∞.

The integral of 1/(1 + t²) dt from 0 to ∞ is π/2, so 2/(π) * (π/2) = 1. So the integral is 1. So option G is a valid density.

Option B has h(y)=2/(π sqrt(y)(1 + y)).

Integral of option B would be ∫ [2/(π sqrt(y)(1 + y))] dy.

Again, substitute t = sqrt(y), so y = t², dy=2t dt.

Integral becomes ∫ [2/(π t (1 + t²))] * 2t dt = ∫ [4/(π (1 + t²))] dt from 0 to ∞.

Which is 4/π * (π/2) ) = 2. So the integral would be 2, which can't be a density since it must integrate to 1. So option B's integral is 2, which is invalid. So option B cannot be correct.

So that confirms that option G is correct, as its integral is 1.

So the correct answer is option G.

To find the density function of \( Y = X^2 \), where \( X \) has the density function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{\pi(1 + x^2)} \) for \( -\infty < x < \infty \), we use the method of transformation of variables. 

### Key Steps:
1. **Transformation and Inverse Mapping**:  
   Since \( Y = X^2 \), the inverse mapping is \( X = \sqrt{Y} \) and \( X = -\sqrt{Y} \). For each \( Y = y > 0 \), there are two corresponding \( X \) values: \( \sqrt{y} \) and \( -\sqrt{y} \).

2. **Derivative of the Inverse Transformation**:  
   The derivative of \( X = \sqrt{Y} \) with respect to \( Y \) is \( \frac{d}{dy} \sqrt{y} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{y}} \). Similarly, the derivative of \( X = -\sqrt{Y} \) is \( \frac{d}{dy} (-\sqrt{y}) = -\frac{1}{2\sqrt{y}} \). Taking the absolute value, the magnitude of the derivative is \( \frac{1}{2\sqrt{y}} \) for both cases.

3. **Density Transformation Formula**:  
   The density function of \( Y \), \( h(y) \), is given by summing the contributions from both branches of the inverse transformation:  
   \[
   h(y) = f(\sqrt{y}) \cdot \left| \frac{d}{dy} \sqrt{y} \right| + f(-\sqrt{y}) \cdot \left| \frac{d}{dy} (-\sqrt{y}) \right|.
   \]  
   Since \( f(x) \) is even (\( f(\sqrt{y}) = f(-\sqrt{y}) \)), this simplifies to:  
   \[
   h(y) = 2 \cdot f(\sqrt{y}) \cdot \frac{1}{2\sqrt{y}} = \
