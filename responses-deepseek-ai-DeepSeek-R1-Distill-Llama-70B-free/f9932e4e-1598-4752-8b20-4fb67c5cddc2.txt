Question:

A property owner who owner her property in fee simple leased a three-story house and the 21 -acre tract upon which it stood to a friend for a term of 10 years. By the terms of the lease, the friend expressly covenanted to pay a monthly rental of $300 and to pay the taxes on the premises during the term of the lease. The lease also stipulated that the friend, as lessee, may not assign or sublease the said premises. The friend and his family lived in the house for two years. Then the friend assigned his leasehold interest in the property to a cousin, who was unaware of the prohibition against assignments. This written assignment expressly provided that the cousin would pay the owner the monthly rental of $300, but was silent concerning the payment of taxes. The owner never objected to this assignment. Six months after the assignment, the owner conveyed her property interest in the premises to a developer. During the cousin's tenancy, the State Highway Authority filed proceedings to condemn two acres of the tract for the purpose of highway construction. As a result, the cousin contacted the developer and informed him that he should be entitled to an apportioned reduction in the rental. After the developer refused to reduce the rent, the cousin brings an action to have his rent apportioned pro tanto. Judgment should be for

Options:

A: the cousin, because eminent domain operates as an apportionment of rent.
B: the developer, because the cousin would be held to the original leasehold contract.
C: the developer, because the cousin was not a party to the original lease agreement.
D: the cousin, because the friend violated the terms of the lease by assigning it without permission.
E: the cousin, because the developer did not have the authority to refuse a rent reduction.
F: the developer, as the prohibition against assignments was not known by the cousin.
G: the cousin, because the condemnation proceedings effectively changed the terms of the lease.
H: the developer, although the cousin would be entitled to terminate the lease.
I: the cousin, because the value of his leasehold interest was reduced pro tanto.
J: the developer, because the cousin failed to pay the taxes as stipulated in the original lease.

Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down.

So, the situation is about a property owner who leased her property to a friend for 10 years. The lease includes a few key points: the friend must pay $300 monthly and the taxes on the premises. Also, the lease says the friend can't assign or sublease without permission. 

The friend lived there for two years, then assigned the lease to his cousin without permission. The assignment was in writing, and the cousin agreed to pay the $300 rent but didn't mention taxes. The owner didn't object to this assignment. Later, the owner sold the property to a developer. Now, the state is condemning two acres for a highway. The cousin wants a reduction in rent because part of the land is taken. The developer refuses, so the cousin sues for an apportioned reduction.

The question is whether the rent should be apportioned. The options are A through J.

First, I think about the lease terms. The original lease prohibits assignment, but the friend did it anyway. However, the owner didn't object. So, does that mean the assignment is valid despite the prohibition? I remember that if a lessor doesn't object to an assignment, it might be considered accepted, even if the lease says no assignments without permission.

Next, the cousin is now the lessee, but he didn't agree to pay taxes, only the rent. But the original lease required the friend to pay taxes. So, does the cousin have to pay taxes? Or does that obligation stay with the friend? Because the assignment was of the leasehold interest, typically, the assignee (cousin) takes on all the terms, including paying taxes. But in this case, the assignment was silent on taxes. Hmm, maybe that's a point, but the question is about rent apportionment, not taxes.

The main issue here is the condemnation. When part of the leased property is taken through eminent domain, does the rent get reduced proportionally? I think the general rule is that if a part of the property is condemned, the rent apportions. So, the tenant pays rent only for the part they can still use. But does that apply here?

Wait, but the lease was assigned. The original lessee (friend) assigned to the cousin without permission, but the owner didn't object. So, the cousin is in possession. Now, when part of the land is taken, the cousin is affected. The developer, as the new owner, is the lessor now.

I remember that when a partial taking occurs, the tenant is entitled to an apportionment of the rent. The tenant doesn't have to pay for the part taken. So, the cousin should get a reduction.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the cousin wins because eminent domain apportions rent. That sounds right.

Option B says the developer wins because the cousin is bound by the original lease. But the lease terms about assignment might not affect the apportionment right.

Option C says the developer wins because the cousin wasn't a party to the original lease. But the cousin is now the assignee, so he's a party now, even if the assignment wasn't allowed. But the owner didn't object, so maybe the assignment is effective.

Option D says the cousin wins because the friend violated the lease by assigning. But the question is about the rent, not about whether the assignment was valid.

Option E says the cousin wins because the developer can't refuse a reduction. But why would the developer not have authority? They are the new owner, so they should have the authority unless the lease says otherwise.

Option F says the developer wins because the cousin didn't know about the assignment prohibition. But the cousin's knowledge might not matter because the lease's terms are still in effect.

Option G says the cousin wins because condemnation changed the lease terms. I'm not sure if condemnation changes the lease terms automatically; perhaps it's more about the apportionment right.

Option H says the developer wins, but the cousin can terminate. I don't think termination is the issue here; the cousin wants to stay but pay less.

Option I says the cousin wins because his leasehold value is reduced. That makes sense because the value is diminished, so rent should be apportioned.

Option J says the developer wins because the cousin didn't pay taxes. But the question is about the rent, not the taxes. Unless the lease terms require the tenant to pay taxes, and the cousin didn't, but the assignment didn't mention that, so maybe the cousin is still responsible. But the issue here is rent apportionment, so maybe J isn't the right reason.

Wait, the original lease required the friend to pay taxes. When the friend assigned to the cousin, the cousin only agreed to pay rent. So, is the cousin liable for taxes? Or does the original lessee (friend) remain liable? Because in assignments, the assignee usually takes on all the obligations, but here the assignment was silent on taxes. So perhaps the cousin isn't paying taxes, which could be a breach. But the question is about rent apportionment, so maybe J is a possible answer if the cousin isn't paying taxes, but the question doesn't say the developer is enforcing that. It's more about the condemnation.

So, back to the main issue: when part of the property is taken, the rent can be apportioned. So, the cousin should get a reduction. So the answer should be either A or I.

Option A says eminent domain operates as apportionment. Option I says because the leasehold value was reduced. Both seem similar. I think the rule is that when there's a partial taking, the lease is apportioned, and the tenant pays only for the part remaining. So the answer would be A or I.

But I'm trying to recall the exact rule. In property law, when the government takes part of the leased premises through eminent domain, the rent abates proportionally. So the tenant doesn't have to pay for the part taken. So the cousin is entitled to an apportionment.

So, looking at the options, A says "because eminent domain operates as an apportionment of rent." That sounds correct.

But wait, the lease was assigned without permission. Does that affect the cousin's right to apportionment? The lease prohibits assignment, but the owner didn't object. So, the assignment might be effective. If the assignment was invalid, the cousin might be a tenant at will or something, but I think the owner's inaction might mean the assignment is accepted.

So, the cousin is the current tenant, and the partial taking entitles him to reduced rent. So the judgment should be for the cousin, options A or I.

Between A and I, I think A is the right reasoning because it's about the eminent domain causing apportionment. Option I is about the value being reduced, which is a result of the condemnation, but the legal reason is the eminent domain.

So, the answer should be A.

The question revolves around a lease agreement and the apportionment of rent following a partial condemnation of the property through eminent domain. The property owner leased a three-story house and a 21-acre tract to a friend for 10 years. The lease prohibited assignment or subleasing without permission and required the friend to pay $300 monthly rent and taxes. The friend assigned the lease to a cousin without permission, and the assignment was silent on taxes but promised to pay the rent. The owner did not object to the assignment. Later, the owner sold the property to a developer. During the cousin's tenancy, the State Highway Authority condemned two acres for highway construction, and the cousin sought an apportioned reduction in rent, which the developer refused.

The key issue is whether the cousin is entitled to a reduction in rent due to the partial condemnation. Under property law, when part of a leased property is taken through eminent domain, the rent is typically apportioned, and the tenant is only required to pay for the portion of the property that remains in their possession. This principle applies regardless of whether the lease explicitly addresses condemnation, as the partial taking diminishes the value of the leasehold interest.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** correctly states that eminent domain operates as an apportionment of rent, aligning with the legal principle that the tenant is entitled to a reduction in rent proportionate to the value of the property taken.
- **Option B** is incorrect because the cousin, as the assignee, is bound by the lease terms, but this does not negate the right to apportionment due to condemnation.
- **Option C** is incorrect because the cousin, as the current lessee, is effectively a party to the lease, even if the assignment was initially prohibited.
- **Option D** is irrelevant to the issue of rent apportionment.
- **Option E** is incorrect because the developer, as the new owner, has the authority to negotiate or refuse rent adjustments unless the lease specifies otherwise.
- **Option F** is irrelevant because the cousin's knowledge of the assignment prohibition does not affect the right to apportionment.
- **Option G** is incorrect because condemnation does not unilaterally change the lease terms; it merely entitles the tenant to apportionment.
- **Option H** is incorrect because the issue is not about lease termination but rent reduction.
- **Option I** is close but less precise than Option A, as it focuses on the reduction in leasehold value rather than the specific legal principle of eminent domain causing apportionment.
- **Option J** is incorrect because the issue of tax payment is unrelated to the question of rent apportionment.

The correct answer is **Option A**, as it directly addresses the legal principle that eminent domain operates to apportion rent when part of the leased property is taken.
