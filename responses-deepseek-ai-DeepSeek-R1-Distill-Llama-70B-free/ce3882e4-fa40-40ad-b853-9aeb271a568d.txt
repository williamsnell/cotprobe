Okay, so I have this legal question about evidence admissibility, specifically dealing with hearsay exceptions. Let me try to break it down.

The scenario is a defendant on trial for bribing a government procurement officer. The defendant provided the officer with free vacation facilities. When approached by an FBI investigator, the defendant made two statements. First, she said the invitation was just a favor to a friend and unrelated to his government job. Second, she offered to reveal some "hot" information about a large-scale fraud in exchange for the investigator dropping the vacation issue.

The question is whether the investigator's testimony about the defendant's offer to give information is admissible.

I remember that hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted. If a statement is hearsay, it's generally inadmissible unless there's an exception.

Looking at the options, I need to figure out if the defendant's offer falls under any hearsay exceptions or if it's admissible for another reason.

Option A: No, because the statement was made under duress. I'm not sure if this applies. Duress can sometimes relate to confessions, but the defendant wasn't necessarily confessing here. She was trying to negotiate, so maybe not.

Option B: No, because she wasn't under oath. I don't think being under oath is a requirement for admissibility. Statements can be admissible even if not sworn, especially if they're party admissions.

Option C: No, because it's part of a negotiation for settlement. Wait, I remember that statements made during plea negotiations are inadmissible under FRE 410. But here, she's not negotiating a plea, just trying to exchange information to stop an investigation. Not sure if that's covered under 410, which might be more about offers to plead guilty.

Option D: Yes, as a statement of a party's agent. I don't think this applies because the defendant is the party, not an agent or servant of someone else.

Option E: Yes, because voluntary. It's voluntary, but that alone doesn't make it non-hearsay. It just means it's not coerced, but it's still hearsay unless an exception applies.

Option F: No, hearsay without exception. If this is correct, then the statement is inadmissible. But I need to check the exceptions.

Option G: Yes, as an opposing party's statement. Oh, right! Under FRE 801(d)(2)(A), a statement is not hearsay if it's offered against an opposing party and was made by the party's agent or the party himself. Since the defendant is the party, her own statement would qualify under this. Wait, but 801(d)(2) applies to admissions by a party-opponent. So yes, the defendant's own statement would be an admission and thus not hearsay.

Option H: Yes, because the investigator had a duty. I don't think this applies. The duty to report might affect whether it's hearsay, but I'm not sure. Maybe not relevant here.

Option I: Yes, as a statement against penal interest. That exception (FRE 804(b)(3)) applies when the declarant is unavailable and the statement is against their interest. But the defendant is available, so this doesn't apply.

Option J: No, because of right to counsel. Miranda rights might be an issue, but the defendant wasn't under arrest, so maybe Miranda doesn't apply. I'm not sure if the right to counsel affects admissibility here, but I think this isn't the main issue.

So, putting it together: the defendant's offer to exchange information is a statement made by the defendant herself. It's an admission by a party-opponent. Under FRE 801(d)(2), this is not hearsay. So the statement is admissible.

Wait, but the offer to exchange information—does that count as an admission? She's offering to provide information in exchange for leniency. That might not be an admission of guilt, but more of a negotiation tactic. But the key is that it's a statement by the defendant being offered against her. So it's an admission regardless of whether it's an actual confession.

Therefore, the correct answer would be G: Yes, as a statement of an opposing party.
</think>

The question revolves around the admissibility of the defendant's statement to an FBI investigator, specifically her offer to reveal "hot" information about a large-scale fraud in exchange for the investigator dropping the investigation into the vacation issue. The key issue is whether this statement constitutes hearsay and, if so, whether it falls under any exception.

Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted. However, under Federal Rule of Evidence (FRE) 801(d)(2)(A), a statement is not considered hearsay if it is an admission by a party-opponent. Here, the defendant’s statement is being offered against her in a criminal trial, making it an admission by a party-opponent. This exception applies because the defendant is the opposing party, and her statement is being used against her.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. There is no indication the statement was made under duress.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Being under oath is not a requirement for admissibility.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. While FRE 410 excludes statements made during plea negotiations, this situation involves an attempt to exchange information, not a formal plea negotiation.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. This applies to statements by an agent or servant, which is not relevant here.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. While the statement was voluntary, voluntariness alone does not resolve the hearsay issue.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The statement is admissible under the party-opponent admission exception.
- **Option G**: Correct. The statement qualifies as an admission by a party-opponent under FRE 801(d)(2)(A).
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The investigator’s duty to report does not directly affect the admissibility of the statement.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The statement against penal interest exception does not apply because the defendant is available to testify.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The right to counsel is not a central issue here.

The defendant’s statement is admissible as a party-opponent admission under FRE 801(d)(2)(A).
