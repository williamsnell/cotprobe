Okay, so I have this physics problem here about Tesla units, and I'm a bit rusty on my electromagnetism, but I'll try to work through it. The question is asking which of the given options is NOT equal to one tesla. The options are A through F.

Hmm, Tesla is the unit of magnetic field strength. I remember that one tesla equals one weber per square meter. Oh wait, Weber is the unit of magnetic flux, so that's option E: 1 Wb/m². So E is equal to one tesla, so it's not the answer.

Now, I need to check the other options. Let me think about the units for each.

Starting with option A: 1 A·N/V. Wait, Newton is kg·m/s², and Volt is J/C, which is (kg·m²/s³)/C. So let's break this down.

A is (A * N) / V. Substituting the units: (A * (kg·m/s²)) / ( (kg·m²/s³)/C ) ). Simplify denominator: kg·m²/(s³·C). So the whole thing becomes (A·kg·m/s²) * (s³·C)/(kg·m²). The units here: A is current, which is C/s. So substituting A with C/s, that gives ( (C/s) * kg·m / s² ) * ( s³ * C ) / ( kg * m² ). Let me compute that step by step.

Multiply the numerators: C/s * kg·m/s² = kg·m·C/(s³). Multiply by s³·C from the denominator part: kg·m·C/(s³) * s³·C = kg·m·C².

Denominator: kg·m². So overall, (kg·m·C²) / (kg·m²) ) = C²/(m). Hmm, not sure if that's getting me anywhere. Maybe I'm complicating it. Let me think differently.

Another approach: Tesla can be expressed in terms of other units. I recall that Tesla equals kg/(s²·A). Wait, no, more accurately, from Maxwell's equations, the units of B (magnetic field) are kg/(s^2·A). Let's see.

If I look at each option:

Option B: 1 kg·m/(A·s²). Let's see the units. kg·m/(A·s²). That would be (kg·m) / (A s²). Hmm, Tesla is kg/(A s²), so B has an extra meter in the numerator. So kg·m/(A s²) would be Tesla multiplied by meter? Or wait, no, Tesla is kg/(A s²), so B is kg m/(A s²) = (kg/(A s²)) * m = T·m. So this is meters times tesla. So option B is not equal to one tesla. Or wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Because the units for B (tesla) are kg/(A·s²). So option B is kg·m/(A s²) → that would be kg/(A s²) multiplied by m, so that's T·m. So B is T·m, which is not the same as T. So B is not equal to one tesla. But wait, I'm not sure yet. I need to check all options.

Option C: 1 N/(A·m). Newton is kg·m/s². So (kg·m/s²) / (A·m) ) = kg/(s²·A). Which is kg/(A s²), which is the unit of tesla. So option C is equal to T. So C is correct, not the answer.

Option D: 1 J/(A·s). Joule is kg·m²/s². So (kg·m²/s²) / (A·s) ) → kg·m²/(A s³). That doesn't look like tesla's units. But wait, maybe I can relate it through other terms. Hmm, I'm not sure. Let's think about the units again. J is energy, so J/(A s) would be (energy)/(current·time) → energy per ampere per second. Not sure how that relates to tesla. Maybe I should move on and come back.

Option F: 1 J/(A·m²). J is kg·m²/s². So (kg·m²/s²) / (A·m²) → kg/(A s²). Oh, that's the same as tesla. Because kg/(A s²) is T. So F is equal to one tesla.

Wait, so F is correct, not the answer. So the option that is not equal is one of the others.

Wait, let me recount.

Weber is T·m². So 1 Wb/m² is T, so E is correct, not the answer.

Option A was 1 A·N/V, which I tried but got stuck. Let me think again.

A · N / V → (A) * (kg m/s²) / (V). Volt is J/C = (kg m²/s²)/(C). So V = (kg m²)/(s² C). So A is (A * kg m/s²) / (kg m²/(s² C)) )

Simplify numerator: A * kg m / s² → (C/s) * kg m/s² → kg m C / s^3.

Denominator is kg m²/(s² C). So overall, (kg m C / s^3) / (kg m²/(s² C)) ) → (kg m C s² C) ) / ( s^3 kg m² ) )

Wait, denominator is kg m²/(s² C), so when you invert and multiply, it's kg m C * s² C / (s^3 kg m² ) )

Hmm, the kg cancels, m cancels with m² to leave 1/m. s² in numerator and s^3 gives 1/s. So units: (C²) / (m·s).

Wait, but Tesla is kg/(A s²) → and since A is C/s, so kg/( (C/s) s² ) → kg s/(C s² ) → kg/(C s). Hmm, not sure if that's matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should find expressions for each option and see which is different.

I know that 1 T = 1 Wb/m² (E is correct), 1 T = 1 kg/(A s²) (so C is correct), 1 T = 1 N·s/(A·m²) ?? Wait, maybe not.

Wait, N is kg m/s². So N/(A m) is option C: (kg m/s²)/(A m) → kg/(A s²), which is T. So C is correct.

Option B: kg m/(A s²) → which is kg/(A s²) * m → T * m, so B is T·m, which is larger unit than T. So B is not equal to T.

Wait no, wait. Wait a second, let me think. Because units can sometimes be tricky. Let's take another approach. Let's recall that 1 T = 1 kg/(A·s²). So if any option's unit doesn't reduce to kg/(A s²), then it's not equal.

Option A: A·N/V → A is C/s, N is kg m/s², V is J/C = (kg m²/s²)/C. So V = kg m²/(s² C).

So A's units: (C/s) * (kg m/s²) / (kg m²/(s² C)) )

Let's compute this step by step.

Multiply numerator: (C/s) * (kg m/s²) → (C kg m) / s^3.

Denominator: kg m²/(s² C). So overall:

[ (C kg m) / s^3 ] / [ kg m²/(s² C) ) ] = [ C kg m * s² C ) ] / [ s^3 * kg m² ]

Simplify:

C^2 kg m s² / ( s^3 kg m² )

Cancel kg: C^2 m s² / ( s^3 m² )

Simplify m: C² s² / ( s^3 m )

Which is C²/(s m).

Hmm, not sure how that relates. Alternatively, perhaps I should express everything in base SI units.

Let me try to express all options in terms of kg, m, s, A, and C (since C is same as A s).

Option A: A·N/V.

N is kg m/s².

V is J/C. J is kg m²/s², so V is (kg m²/s²) / (A s) → since C is A s.

So V = kg m²/(A s^3).

Thus, A·N/V = (A) * (kg m/s²) / (kg m²/(A s^3)) )

Simplify:

A * kg m/s² * A s^3 / (kg m²)

Which is (A^2 kg m s^3) ) / ( kg m² s² )

Cancel kg: (A² m s^3) / (m² s² )

Simplify m: (A² s) / m

So units are (A² s) / m. Hmm, not sure.

But Tesla is kg/(A s²). Let's see if this matches.

I think I'm getting stuck, perhaps I should try another option.

Option D: 1 J/(A s). J is kg m²/s². So (kg m²/s²) / (A s) → kg m²/(A s^3). So the unit is kg m²/(A s^3).

Compare to Tesla's unit kg/(A s²). Not the same. So D is not equal to T.

Wait, but earlier I thought F is equal. Let me recheck F.

Option F: J/(A m²) → (kg m²/s²) / (A m²) → kg/(A s²), which is T. Yes, F equals T.

So D's unit is kg m²/(A s^3), which is (kg/(A s²)) * (1/s) → T*(1/s). So D is T per second, which is not T.

Wait, but the question is which is NOT equal to T. So if D is T/s, it's not equal to T.

Wait, but earlier I thought option B's unit was T·m, so it's also not equal.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Let me recheck option B.

Option B: kg m/(A s²). Tesla's unit is kg/(A s² ). So B has an extra m in the numerator. So the unit is (kg/(A s² )) * m → T·m. So B is T·m, which is larger than T.

So both B and D have units different from T. But wait, that can't be right because the question says one of them is not equal. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, the options given are A to F. The question is to find which is NOT equal to T.

Wait, I thought E was T, correct. C is T. F is T.

Let me recount which options are T.

E is Wb/m² → T.

C is N/(A m) → N is kg m/s², A m is A m. So (kg m/s²)/(A m) → kg/(A s² ) → T. So C is T.

F is J/(A m²) → J is kg m²/s². So (kg m²/s^2 )/(A m² ) → kg/(A s^2) → T. So F is T.

A is 1 A*N/V. Let me compute it again.

A = (A) * (kg m/s²) / V.

V is kg m²/(A s^3 ). So:

A = (A * kg m/s²) / (kg m²/(A s^3 )) → (A * kg m/s²) * (A s^3)/(kg m²)

Simplify:

A² kg m s^3 / ( kg m^2 s² )

kg cancels, m in numerator and m^2 in denominator leaves 1/m.

s^3 / s² is s.

So A² s / m.

Hmm, with units A² s/m. Since A is C/s, substituting:

(C/s)^2 * s/m → C²/(s m). Not sure how that compares to T.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express in terms of base units:

A is current (A = C/s).

So A*N/V = (C/s) * (kg m/s²) / (V).

But V = J/C = (kg m²/s²)/C. So:

A*N/V = (C/s) * (kg m/s²) / ( (kg m²/s²)/C )

Which is (C kg m) / (s^3) ) * (C s² ) / (kg m² )

Multiply numerators: C kg m * C s² → C² kg m s².

Denominator: s^3 kg m².

So overall: C² kg m s² / (s^3 kg m² ) → C²/(s m).

Hmm, I'm getting stuck again. Let's move to option D.

Option D: J/(A s) → (kg m²/s²) / (A s) → kg m²/(A s^3).

Tesla is kg/(A s²). So D has kg m²/(A s^3) → (kg/(A s²)) * (m²/s) → T*(m²/s). So D is not T.

So now, I'm seeing that options B, D, and A may not be T, but wait, earlier I thought E, C, F are correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option A. Let me try to think differently. Perhaps there's an alternative way to express Tesla.

I recall that force on a current-carrying wire is F = I L × B. So F is in Newtons, I in Amperes, L in meters, B in Tesla.

So F = I L B → B = F/(I L) → units are N/(A m) → which is option C, which we've established is T.

Alternatively, another formula: B = (μ0 I)/(2π r), but that involves permeability of free space, which is in T m/A. So that might not help directly.

Another approach: The unit of magnetic flux Φ is Wb = T·m². So E is Wb/m² → T.

What about option A: A·N/V.

Wait, let's think about the units of V. V is the unit of electromotive force (EMF), which is energy per charge. J/C. So V = J/C.

So A·N/V = (A) * (N) / (V) → (A) * (kg m/s²) / ( (kg m²/s²)/C ) )

Wait, because V = (kg m²/s²) / (C).

So denominator becomes (kg m²)/(s² C).

So (A * kg m/s²) divided by (kg m²/(s² C)) → (A kg m /s² ) * (s² C) / (kg m² )

Simplify:

A C (kg m s² ) / (s² kg m² )

Cancel kg, s²:

A C / (m)

A is C/s, so:

( C/s * C ) / m → C²/(s m).

Hmm, not sure. Maybe another approach: think of A·N/V in terms of base units.

But perhaps I should consider each option's unit and see which doesn't match T (kg/(A s²)).

Option A: Let me compute the units again.

A is A (current).

N is kg m/s².

V is J/C, and J is kg m²/s². So V = (kg m²/s²) / C.

So A*N/V is (A) * (kg m/s²) / (kg m²/(s² C)).

Multiply numerator: A * kg m/s² → (C/s) * kg m/s² = C kg m / s³.

Denominator: kg m²/(s² C).

So overall:

(C kg m / s³) / (kg m²/(s² C)) ) = (C kg m * s² C) ) / ( s³ kg m² )

Cancel kg, m in numerator with m^2 gives 1/m.

s² in numerator, s³ in denominator gives 1/s.

So units become (C²) / (m s).

But C is A s, so substitute:

(A s )² / (m s ) → A² s² / (m s ) → A² s / m.

Hmm, not sure how that compares to T.

Tesla's unit is kg/(A s²). So if option A's unit is A² s/m, that's different.

Wait, but how is that possible? Because I thought only one option was not equal to T.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in evaluating option B. Let me recheck.

Option B: kg m/(A s² ). So units are kg m/(A s² ). Tesla is kg/(A s² ). So B is T multiplied by m. So B is T·m, which is not equal to T.

So that's another option that's not equal.

Wait, but how can there be two options not equal? The question states only one is not equal. So I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps some of these options are actually equal through different unit relationships.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this by recalling the units in different forms.

Tesla can be expressed as:

1 T = 1 kg/(A s²)
1 T = 1 Wb/m² (E is correct)
1 T = 1 N/(A m) (C is correct)
1 T = 1 J/(A m²) (F is correct)
1 T = 1 H·A/m² (henrys per area, but not sure if that's relevant here)
Hmm, so I think I've covered E, C, F as correct.

Looking at option B again: kg·m/(A s²) → which is kg/(A s²) * m → T·m. So this is not equal to T.

Option D: J/(A s) → (kg m²/s²) / (A s) → kg m²/(A s^3) → which is (kg/(A s²)) * (m²
