Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to calculate the standard deviation of a sample. The data given is 5, 8, 2, 1. Hmm, wait, let me make sure I understand what each step involves.

First, I remember that standard deviation measures how spread out the numbers are in a dataset. The formula for sample standard deviation is a bit different from population standard deviation because it uses n-1 instead of n in the denominator. Oh right, that's the sample variance, which then gets squared rooted to get the standard deviation.

So the steps I think are: find the mean of the sample, then subtract the mean from each data point, square those differences, average them (with n-1), and then take the square root of that average.

Let me jot down the numbers: 5, 8, 2, 1. So four numbers, meaning n is 4. Therefore, when calculating variance, I'll divide by 3 (n-1).

First step: calculate the mean. Mean is (5+8+2+1)/4. Let's compute that. 5+8 is 13, plus 2 is 15, plus 1 is 16. So 16 divided by 4 is 4. So the mean is 4.

Next step is to find each deviation from the mean. So for each number, subtract the mean.

5 - 4 = 1
8 - 4 = 4
2 - 4 = -2
1 - 4 = -3

Now square each of these differences:

1^2 = 1
4^2 = 16
(-2)^2 = 4
(-3)^2 =9

So the squared differences are 1, 16, 4, 9.

Next, sum these squared differences. 1 +16 is 17, plus 4 is 21, plus 9 is 30. So sum is 30.

Now, since this is a sample, I'll use n-1 which is 3. So the variance is 30 divided by 3, which is 10.

Wait, wait. Wait a minute. Oh wait, no. Variance is the average of the squared differences. So 30 divided by 3 is 10. So variance is 10.

Standard deviation is the square root of the variance. So sqrt(10). Let me calculate that. Sqrt(9) is 3, sqrt(10) is about 3.162... but wait, none of the options I'm seeing seem to match that. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options: A is 2.74, B is 4, C 6.08, D 5.12, E 3.92, F 2, G 1.28, H 4.5, I 1.5, J 3.25.

Hmm, sqrt(10) is approximately 3.16, but none of the options exactly match that. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.

Let me go through each step again to make sure.

Calculating the mean: (5+8+2+1) = 16, divided by 4 gives 4. That's correct.

Subtracting the mean from each data point:

5-4=1, 8-4=4, 2-4=-2, 1-4=-3. Correct.

Squaring each: 1, 16, 4, 9. Correct.

Sum of squares: 1+16=17, +4=21, +9=30. That's correct.

Variance: 30/(4-1) = 30/3=10. So variance is 10. So standard deviation is sqrt(10), which is approximately 3.162.

Wait, but the options don't have 3.16. The closest is E:3.92, J:3.25. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the sum of squares. Let me check again.

5: (5-4)=1, squared is 1.

8: (8-4)=4, squared is 16.

2: (2-4)=-2, squared is 4.

1: (1-4)=-3, squared is 9.

Summing 1+16+4+9 = 30. That's correct.

Hmm, maybe I used the wrong formula? Oh wait, another thought. Wait, sometimes people get confused between population standard deviation and sample. Oh wait, in the question, it says 'sample' so yes, I used n-1, which is correct.

Wait, but maybe the question wants the population standard deviation? No, because it says 'sample'. So I think I did it right.

Wait, perhaps the initial data was written differently. Let me check the question again. Oh, the data is 5, 8, 2, 1, 'lf'? Wait, that can't be. Oh wait, no. Wait, perhaps I misread the data. Let me check.

Wait, the question says: "From the sample of data 5, 8, 2, 1, lf..." Oh, no, wait, perhaps it's a typo. Oh, wait, maybe the last number is 1, and 'lf' is a typo. Because otherwise, 'lf' doesn't make sense as a number. So perhaps the data is 5,8,2,1. So four numbers, which I used. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I forgot a number. Let me check the question again: "data 5,8,2,1, lf..." Wait, wait, perhaps the data is 5,8,2,1, and then 'lf'. That would make five numbers, but 'lf' isn't a number. Oh, perhaps 'lf' is a typo, maybe the number is 1, then maybe another number. Alternatively, perhaps the data is 5,8,2,1, and 'lf' is actually a typo for 'lf' as in 'line feed' or something else, but that doesn't make sense. So perhaps it's a typo, and the data is just four numbers: 5,8,2,1.

So with that, I think my calculation is correct, giving a standard deviation of sqrt(10)=~3.16, but the options don't have that. Wait, looking again at the options, option E is 3.92, which is higher, and option J is 3.25, which is a bit higher than 3.16.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute.

Mean is 4.

Each data point:

5: 5-4=1 → 1²=1

8: 8-4=4 → 16

2: 2-4=-2 → 4

1: 1-4=-3 → 9

Sum of squares: 1+16=17, plus 4 is 21, plus 9 is 30.

Variance: 30/(4-1)=10.

sqrt(10)=3.162... So that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I was supposed to compute the population standard deviation, which would be sqrt(30/4)=sqrt(7.5)=~2.738, which is approximately 2.74, which is option A.

Ah! So that's a possibility. Because if I treated the data as the entire population, the standard deviation would be 2.74, which is option A. But the question says it's a sample, so I should use n-1.

Wait, but perhaps the question is asking for the population standard deviation, even though it's called a sample? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question says: "compute the standard deviation of the sample." So that would be the sample standard deviation, which uses n-1. So I think my initial approach is correct, leading to sqrt(10)=~3.16, but that's not among the options.

But the options don't include 3.16. So perhaps I made a mistake in the mean? Let me check.

Wait, sum is 5+8+2+1=16. Divided by 4 is 4. Correct.

Hmm, maybe the data is 5,8,2,1, and another number that I missed. Let me check the question again. Oh wait, the data is written as "5, 8, 2, 1, lf". Oh wait, perhaps that's a typo and the data is five numbers. Let me see: 5,8,2,1, and then 'lf'—maybe that's supposed to be another number, perhaps 3, or maybe it's a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the data is 5,8,2,1, and 'lf' is a typo for 3 or some other number. Let me try adding another data point. Suppose the data is 5,8,2,1,3. Then n=5.

Mean would be (5+8+2+1+3)=19. 19/5=3.8.

Then each data point minus mean:

5-3.8=1.2 → (1.2)^2=1.44

8-3.8=4.2 → 17.64

2-3.8=-1.8 → 3.24

1-3.8=-2.8 →7.84

3-3.8=-0.8 →0.64

Sum of squares: 1.44+17.64=19.08, +3.24=22.32, +7.84=30.16, +0.64=30.8.

Variance (sample) is 30.8/(5-1)=30.8/4=7.7.

Standard deviation is sqrt(7.7)=~2.774, which is about 2.77, which is close to option A:2.74, but not exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps 'lf' is a typo for 1, making the data 5,8,2,1,1. Then n=5.

Sum is 5+8+2+1+1=17. Mean is 17/5=3.4.

Each data point minus mean:

5-3.4=1.6 →2.56

8-3.4=4.6→21.16

2-3.4=-1.4→1.96

1-3.4=-2.4→5.76

1-3.4=-2.4→5.76

Sum of squares: 2.56+21.16=23.72, +1.96=25.68, +5.76=31.44, +5.76=37.2.

Variance (sample) is 37.2/(5-1)=37.2/4=9.3.

Standard deviation is sqrt(9.3)=~3.05, which is not matching any options.

Hmm, maybe the data is just four points, and the 'lf' is a typo, and the correct data is 5,8,2,1. So I think I'm back to the original calculation, which gives a sample standard deviation of sqrt(10)=3.16, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the sum of squares again.

For data 5,8,2,1:

Deviations from mean 4:

1 →1²=1

4→16

-2→4

-3→9

Sum is 1+16=17+4=21+9=30. Correct.

So variance is 30/3=10. So standard deviation is sqrt(10)=3.162...

Looking at the options, the closest is E:3.92, which is higher, and J:3.25. Hmm, but neither is close to 3.16.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me try calculating the squared differences again.

5: (5-4)=1 →1²=1.

8: (8-4)=4 →16.

2: (2-4)=-2 →4.

1: (1-4)=-3 →9.

Sum is 1+16+4+9=30. Correct.

Wait, maybe the formula I'm using is wrong. Oh wait, wait! Oh no, I think I confused sample and population standard deviation. Wait, no, the formula I used is correct for sample.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is asking for the sample standard deviation but using a different divisor, like n instead of n-1. Let me try that.

If I calculate variance as 30/4=7.5. Then standard deviation is sqrt(7.5)=~2.738, which is approximately 2.74, which is option A.

Ah, so perhaps the question is mistakenly asking for the population standard deviation, or perhaps it's a trick question where they want the population's standard deviation despite saying sample.

So in that case, option A is 2.74, which matches sqrt(7.5).

So perhaps the correct answer is A.

But wait, the question specifically says it's a sample, so I think the correct approach is to use n-1, which gives sqrt(10)=3.16, which is not an option. So this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial data. Let me check again: data is 5,8,2,1.

Wait, perhaps the data is 5,8,2,1, and another number that I missed. Oh wait, the original question says '5, 8, 2, 1, lfcomputethe standard...' Oh wait, perhaps the data is 5,8,2,1, and 'lf' is a typo, but perhaps it's a number, maybe 12? Like 5,8,2,1,12? Let me try that.

So n=5, data:5,8,2,1,12.

Sum is 5+8=13+2=15+1=16+12=28.

Mean is 28/5=5.6.

Deviations:

5-5.6=-0.6 →0.36

8-5.6=2.4→5.76

2-5.6=-3.6→12.96

1-5.6=-4.6→21.16

12-5.6=6.4→40.96

Sum of squares: 0.36+5.76=6.12+12.96=19.08+21.16=40.24+40.96=81.2.

Variance (sample) is 81.2/(5-1)=81.2/4=20.3.

Standard deviation is sqrt(20.3)=~4.506, which is close to option H:4.5.

Hmm, that's an option. But I'm not sure if that's the intended data because the question didn't specify any number after 'lf'. Maybe 'lf' is a typo for '12' or something else. But without knowing, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the data is 5,8,2,1, and that's it. So four numbers, sample standard deviation sqrt(10)=3.16, not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is A, 2.74, which would be if they treated it as population.

Alternatively, maybe I made an error in the sum. Let me check again.

Wait, the data is 5,8,2,1. Sum is 16, mean 4.

Squares:1,16,4,9. Sum is 30.

Sample variance:30/3=10. Sample SD: sqrt(10)=3.16.

So unless I'm missing something, perhaps the intended answer is A:2.74, which would be if they used n=4 instead of n-1.

Wait, but that would be incorrect for a sample. So perhaps the question has a typo, and the correct answer isn't among the options. But that can't be, as it's a multiple-choice.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the closest option. Since 3.16 isn't present, perhaps the intended answer is E:3.92, but that's higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, perhaps the data is 5,8,2,1, and 'lf' is the fifth number. Oh, but 'lf' isn't a number. Alternatively, maybe it's 'l' and 'f' as separate numbers, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should think that 'lf' is a typo, and the data is 5,8,2,1. So four numbers, n=4.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the data is 5,8,2,1, and another number, say 3. Let me try that.

n=5, sum=5+8+2+1+3=19. Mean=3.8.

Deviations:

5-3.8=1.2 →1.44

8-3.8=4.2→17.64

2-3.8=-1.8→3.24

1-3.8=-2.8→7.84

3-3.8=-0.8→0.64

Sum of squares:1.44+17.64=19.08+3.24=22.32+7.84=30.16+0.64=30.8.

Sample variance:30.8/4=7.7. SD=sqrt(7.7)=~2.774, which is close to option A:2.74.

But again, this is speculative because the data isn't clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to proceed with the given data as four numbers, giving a sample standard deviation of sqrt(10)≈3.16, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is A:2.74, assuming population standard deviation.

But in that case, the correct answer would be A.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the question intended to present the data as 5,8,2,1, and 'lf' is a typo, perhaps meaning 1, making it five numbers:5,8,2,1,1.

Let me recalculate with that.

n=5, sum=5+8+2+1+1=17. Mean=3.4.

Deviations:

5-3.4=1.6→2.56

8-3.4=4.6→21.16

2-3.4=-1.4→1.96

1-3.4=-2.4→5.76

1-3.4=-2.4→5.76

Sum of squares=2.56+21.16=23.72+1.
