Question:

A condominium development consists of two buildings, one with balconies attached to each unit, and one withno balconies. For safety concerns, the condominium association amended the covenants and restrictions toprohibit future sales of balcony units to families with minor children. The amendment did not affect families withchildren already living in balcony units. The amendment was promptly recorded. The condominium associationhad a valid covenant providing that all sales had to be approved by the association. Subsequent to the effective date of the amendment, the owner of a balcony unit contracted to sell it to a familywith minor children. Before the closing, the association told the buyers that because they had minor children,they could not buy the unit. The association further told the buyers that numerous units were available in thebuilding without balconies. After receiving this notification, the buyers complained to a fair housing agency, claiming that the amendmentwas unenforceable because it violated federal fair housing laws. Is there reasonable cause to believe that a violation has occurred?

Options:

A: Yes, because families with children are already living in units with balconies.
B: No, because the amendment was promptly recorded and is legally binding.
C: Yes, because families with children cannot be segregated within the condominium development.
D: No, because the association is acting in the best interests of child safety.
E: No, because families with children are allowed to purchase units in the building without balconies.
F: No, because the association has the right to approve all sales.
G: No, because the amendment is based on legitimate safety issues.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about condominium associations and fair housing laws. Let's break it down step by step.

The scenario is about a condo development with two buildings. One has balconies, and the other doesn't. The condo association amended their covenants to prohibit selling balcony units to families with minor children, citing safety concerns. They recorded this amendment, and they had a rule that all sales must be approved by the association.

So, after this amendment, a seller under contract to sell a balcony unit gets told by the association that the buyers can't purchase because they have minor children. The buyers then complain to a fair housing agency, claiming this violates federal laws.

The question is whether there's reasonable cause to believe a violation occurred. The options are from A to G.

I remember that fair housing laws, specifically the Fair Housing Act (FHA), prohibit discrimination based on certain protected characteristics. One of those is familial status, which includes families with children under 18. So, housing providers can't refuse to sell or rent based on having kids, with some exceptions.

But wait, there's an exception for certain housing for older persons, like 55+ communities, but that's not the case here. The amendment here is targeting families with children for safety reasons related to balconies.

So, the association is trying to prohibit the sale of balcony units to families with kids. But does this violate the FHA? I think it might because it's discriminatory based on familial status. Even if the reason is safety, singling out families with children could be seen as discrimination.

Looking at the options:

A: Yes, because families are already there. I'm not sure if that's the right reason. The fact that some families are already present doesn't necessarily make the rule illegal, but the rule itself might be.

B: No, because recorded and binding. The recording makes it enforceable under property law, but that doesn't mean it's compliant with federal law.

C: Yes, because it's segregating. The rule prevents families with kids from buying in one building, which could be seen as segregation. That might be a violation.

D: No, because of child safety. While the intent is safety, the method is discriminatory. So this might not hold up.

E: No, because they can buy elsewhere. The FHA doesn't allow steering or saying they can live elsewhere. It's still discrimination if they're being excluded from certain units based on having kids.

F: No, because approval right. Having approval rights doesn't mean they can discriminate. The approval can't be based on protected characteristics.

G: No, because of safety. Similar to D, the justification doesn't make the discrimination legal.

So, the correct answer seems to be C, because it's segregating families with children within the development, which violates the FHA. Alternatively, A might be a consideration, but I think C is more directly on point.

The correct answer is C. The condominium association's amendment prohibiting the sale of balcony units to families with minor children likely violates federal fair housing laws, specifically the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination based on familial status. Although the amendment was recorded and the association has the right to approve sales, these factors do not justify discrimination. The rule effectively segregates families with children, which is unlawful under the FHA. 

Answer: C
