Okay, so I've got this problem here about heat loss from a pipe due to free convection. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through. Let me see what the question says.

The pipe is horizontal with an outside diameter of 12 inches. The temperature of the outer surface is 110°F, and the surrounding air is at 90°F with 1 atm pressure. They want the rate of heat loss per unit length, so per foot I guess.

I remember that for free convection, the heat transfer coefficient (h) is calculated using some correlations. Oh right, the formula involves the Grashof number and Prandtl number. Or maybe it's the Nusselt number? Wait, the Nusselt number (Nu) relates to the heat transfer coefficient, right. So Nu = h*L/k, where L is the characteristic length.

But wait, for a horizontal cylinder, the characteristic length is the diameter, I think. Oh wait no, for a cylinder in free convection, the characteristic length is actually the diameter times some factor. Or maybe it's the radius? I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recall.

Oh, right, for horizontal cylinders, the correlation for the Nusselt number is different than for vertical ones. I think the formula is something like Nu = some constant multiplied by (Gr * Pr)^n, where Gr is the Grashof number and Pr is the Prandtl number. But I don't remember the exact values of the constants and the exponents.

Wait, maybe it's more precise. I think for a horizontal cylinder, the Nusselt number can be approximated using the equation: Nu = 0.53 * (Gr * Pr)^0.25, but only when the product Gr*Pr is between certain ranges, like maybe 10^4 to 10^9 or something. I'm not entirely sure about the exact range, but maybe that's the right formula.

So first, I need to calculate the Grashof number. Gr is defined as (g * β * ΔT * L^3) / ν². Wait, what's β? Oh right, β is the volume expansion coefficient, which is 1/T for gases, where T is the absolute temperature. But wait, in this case, the fluid is air, so yes, β = 1/T.

But wait, the temperatures are given in Fahrenheit. Oh, right, I need to convert them to absolute temperatures in Rankine because the formula uses absolute temperatures. So T_s is the surface temperature, 110°F. To convert to Rankine, I add 459.67. So 110 + 459.67 is 569.67 R. Similarly, the air temperature T_inf is 90°F, which is 90 + 459.67 = 549.67 R.

Wait wait, no. Wait, wait, the film temperature is usually the average of the surface and ambient temperatures. Oh right, because properties are often evaluated at the film temperature. So T_film = (T_s + T_inf)/2. Let's compute that.

T_film = (110 + 90)/2 = 100°F, which is 460 + 100 = 560 R? Wait no, wait, 100°F is 460 + 100 = 560 R? Wait, no, 100°F is 37.78°C, but in Rankine, it's 100 + 459.67 = 559.67 R.

Wait, no. Wait, 32°F is 0°C, which is 273.15 K. So 1°F is 0.55556 K. So 110°F is (110-32)*0.55556 + 273.15 = 43.333 * 0.55556 ≈ 24.04°C, which is 297.19 K, which is 297.19 * 9/5 ≈ 534.34 R. Wait, maybe I should double-check that.

Wait, to convert Fahrenheit to Rankine: °R = °F + 459.67. So 110°F is 569.67 R, 90°F is 549.67 R. The film temperature is their average: (569.67 + 549.67)/2 = (1119.34)/2 = 559.67 R.

Wait, that makes sense. So T_film is 559.67 R.

Now, I need the properties of air at this temperature. The properties are: kinematic viscosity ν, thermal conductivity k, and Prandtl number Pr. Or wait, I can get β from T_film because β=1/T for ideal gases.

So, β = 1 / T_film = 1 / 559.67 ≈ 0.001787 R^-1.

The temperature difference ΔT is T_s - T_inf, which is 110 - 90 = 20°F. Wait, but in absolute terms, since the formula uses ΔT in the same units as T, which is Rankine. Wait, no—wait, when you take ΔT as T_s - T_inf, and since T is in R, then ΔT in R is 569.67 - 549.67 = 20 R. So same as 20°F because each degree F is same as each degree R in size, so 20°F = 20 R. So ΔT is 20 R.

The characteristic length L for a horizontal cylinder is the diameter, right? Or wait, for a cylinder, maybe the diameter is the length. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Wait, the Grashof number is Gr = (g β ΔT L^3)/ν². For a horizontal cylinder, the characteristic length L is the diameter, D. So D is 12 inches, which is 1 foot. So L is 1 ft.

So, now I need to find the air properties at T_film=559.67 R. What are the values for ν (kinematic viscosity), k (thermal conductivity), and Pr (Prandtl number)?

I think at around 100°F, the properties of air are approximately:

ν ≈ 0.0000172 ft²/s (but I'm not sure, maybe I should recall typical values. Alternatively, I can remember that at 60°F (around 520 R), ν for air is about 0.0000167 ft²/s. Since temperature increases, ν increases. So maybe around 0.000017 ft²/s at 100°F.

Similarly, thermal conductivity k is around 0.015 BTU/(hr·ft·°F) at 100°F. Wait, maybe 0.0145 or 0.015. And the Prandtl number Pr is about 0.7, roughly. I think for air, Pr is around 0.7 across a range of temperatures.

So, let's plug in some approximate values:

ν ≈ 0.000017 ft²/s.

k ≈ 0.015 BTU/(hr·ft·°F).

Pr ≈ 0.7.

Now, compute Grashof number Gr:

Gr = (g * β * ΔT * L^3) / ν².

g is the acceleration due to gravity, 32.174 ft/s².

Plugging in the numbers:

Gr = (32.174 ft/s²) * (0.001787 R^-1) * (20 R) * (1 ft)^3 / (0.000017 ft²/s)^2.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute numerator:

32.174 * 0.001787 = let's see, 32 * 0.0018 is approximately 0.0576. More accurately, 32.174 * 0.001787 ≈ 0.0575 (exact: 32.174 * 0.001787 ≈ 0.0575).

Then multiply by 20: 0.0575 * 20 ≈ 1.15.

Multiply by L^3, which is 1: so 1.15.

Denominator: (0.000017)^2 = 0.000000000289 (since (17e-6)^2 = 289e-12 = 0.000000000289).

So Gr = 1.15 / 0.000000000289.

Let me compute that. 1.15 / 2.89e-10 ≈ (1.15 / 2.89) * 1e10 ≈ 0.3978 * 1e10 ≈ 3.978e9.

So Gr ≈ 3.978e9.

Wait, but wait, wait. Did I compute that correctly? Let me double-check.

Wait, 0.000017 squared is (1.7e-5)^2 = 2.89e-10. So denominator is 2.89e-10.

Numerator is 32.174 * 0.001787 = approximately 32 * 0.001787 is 0.0571. Then 0.0571 * 20 = 1.142. Multiply by 1^3 is 1.142.

So Gr is 1.142 / 2.89e-10 = (1.142 / 2.89) * 1e10 ≈ 0.3955 * 1e10 ≈ 3.955e9.

So Gr ≈ 3.955e9.

Now, the product Gr * Pr is 3.955e9 * 0.7 ≈ 2.7685e9.

Wait, but the formula I thought of is Nu = 0.53*(Gr*Pr)^0.25. So first compute (Gr*Pr)^(0.25).

Compute (2.7685e9)^(0.25):

Well, 1e9 is (1e3)^3, so (1e9)^(0.25)= (1e3)^(3/4)= 1e^(9*(1/4))=1e^(2.25)= approx 177.8279.

So 2.7685e9 = 2.7685 * 1e9, so (2.7685e9)^(0.25)= (2.7685)^(0.25) * (1e9)^(0.25) = approx (1.305) * (177.83) ≈ 232.0.

Because 2.7685^(1/4) is around 1.305. Let me check: 1.3^4= 2.8561, which is close to 2.7685. So 1.3^4 is 2.8561, which is a bit higher, so maybe around 1.29 or so.

Wait, let me compute 1.3^4: 1.3*1.3=1.69, 1.69*1.3=2.197, 2.197*1.3≈ 2.856. So 1.3^4≈2.856, which is higher than 2.7685. So perhaps 1.29^4: 1.29*1.29=1.664, *1.29= 2.152, *1.29≈2.778. Oh, that's very close to 2.7685. So (2.7685)^(0.25)≈1.29.

So, (Gr*Pr)^(0.25)≈1.29 * 177.83 ≈ 229.7.

Then, Nu = 0.53 * 229.7 ≈ 121.7.

Wait, but Nu is h*L/k. So h = Nu * k / L.

Wait, L is 1 ft, so h = Nu * k.

Wait, but I think I might have mixed up the formula. Let me double-check: Nu = h * L / k → h = (Nu * k)/L.

Wait, but in this case, since L is 1 ft, then h = Nu * k. Because h = (Nu * k) / L → if L is 1, h = Nu * k.

So k is 0.015 BTU/(hr·ft·°F).

So h ≈ 121.7 * 0.015 ≈ 1.8255 BTU/(hr·ft²·°F).

Wait, but that seems low. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, the correlation: for a horizontal cylinder, I think the correct Nusselt number correlation is Nu = 0.53*(Gr*Pr)^0.25, for the case where Gr*Pr is between 1e4 and 1e9 or something. But wait, I'm not sure if that's the exact formula. Another source I recall says that for horizontal cylinders, the Churchill and Chu correlation might be more accurate, which is Nu = 0.36*(Gr*Pr)^(0.21)/(1 + 0.481*(Pr)^(-0.19)*(Gr/(0.0001*10^12))^(1/24)) ). Wait, that's more complicated, but perhaps more accurate. Hmm, but that might be too involved for an approximate calculation.

Alternatively, I think for Gr*Pr between 1e-5 and 1e10, the correlation varies. Wait, perhaps the initial approach is sufficient for an approximate calculation.

So proceeding with h ≈ 121.7 * 0.015 → 1.8255 BTU/(hr·ft²·°F).

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the Gr calculation. Let me recheck the Gr calculation.

Gr = (g * β * ΔT * L^3) / ν².

g=32.174 ft/s².

β=1/559.67≈0.001787 R^-1.

ΔT=20 R.

L=1 ft.

ν=0.000017 ft²/s.

So:

32.174 * 0.001787 ≈ 0.0575.

0.0575 * 20 = 1.15.

1.15 * 1 = 1.15.

Denominator: (0.000017)^2 = 0.000000000289.

So Gr=1.15 / 0.000000000289 ≈ 3.98e9.

Then Gr*Pr=3.98e9 * 0.7=2.786e9.

So (Gr*Pr)^(0.25)= (2.786e9)^(0.25)= (2.786)^(0.25) * (1e9)^(0.25)= approx 1.29 * 177.8= 229.5.

Then Nu=0.53*229.5≈ 121.6.

h=Nu *k / L= 121.6 *0.015 / 1= 1.824 BTU/(hr·ft²·°F).

Wait, but that seems low. Because typical h values for free convection are maybe around 1-5 BTU/(hr·ft²·°F), but I'm not sure. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, I think I might have messed up the units somewhere. Let me check the units in the Grashof number.

The Grashof number is dimensionless, so all the units should cancel out. Let me confirm the units:

g has units ft/s².

β is in 1/R.

ΔT is in R.

L is in ft.

ν is in ft²/s.

So:

[g] = ft/s².

[β]= 1/R.

[ΔT]= R.

[L]^3= ft^3.

ν^2= (ft²/s)^2= ft^4/s².

So numerator: (ft/s²) * (1/R) * R * ft^3 = ft^4/s².

Denominator: ft^4/s².

So overall, Gr is dimensionless. That checks out.

Hmm, so perhaps the calculation is correct. So h=1.824, which is about 1.82 BTU/(hr·ft²·°F).

Wait, but wait. Then the heat loss per unit length is q, which for a cylinder is given by q = 2πrL h (T_s - T_inf), but wait, wait, for a unit length, L=1 ft, so q per unit length would be:

q = 2πr h (T_s - T_inf).

Wait, but r is the radius, which is 6 inches, so 0.5 ft.

So, q = 2 * π * 0.5 ft * h * (110 - 90)°F.

Wait, but wait, T_s and T_inf are in Fahrenheit, but when using h in BTU/(hr·ft²·°F), the temperature difference should be in °F, which it is (20°F).

So, q = 2π * 0.5 ft * h * 20°F.

Simplify: 2 * π * 0.5 = π, so q = π * h * 20.

h is 1.824, so:

q ≈ 3.1416 * 1.824 * 20.

Let me compute that: 3.1416 *1.824 ≈ 5.73, then 5.73 * 20 ≈ 114.6 BTU/(hr·ft).

Wait, but that's way higher than any of the options. The options are like 24, 28, 30, up to 50. So 114 is way over. Hmm, that can't be right. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, wait, I think I messed up the formula for the heat transfer. Let me think again. The correct formula for heat loss from a cylinder is q = 2πrLh (T_s - T_inf). Since we have unit length, L=1 ft, so it's q = 2πr h (T_s - T_inf).

Wait, r is 6 inches, which is 0.5 ft.

So, q = 2 * π * 0.5 * h * 20.

That's π * h * 20.

h is 1.824, so π *1.824≈5.73, times 20 is 114.6. Hmm, but that's 114.6 BTU/hr-ft, which is not among the options. The highest option is C:50.

So, I must have made a mistake in calculating h. Let me go back and check.

Wait, maybe I confused the formula for h. Let me reevaluate the Nusselt number calculation.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong correlation. Let me check the correct formula for the Nusselt number for a horizontal cylinder in free convection.

I think another correlation is Nu = 0.4*(Gr*Pr)^0.25 for 1e4 < Gr*Pr < 1e6. Or perhaps another exponent.

Wait, another source I remember says that for a horizontal cylinder, the Nusselt number can be calculated with Nu = C*(
