Okay, so I've got this question about PCM and channel bandwidth. Hmm, I remember that PCM stands for Pulse Code Modulation. It's a method used to convert analog signals into digital signals. The question has two parts, (a) and (b). Let me try to break them down step by step.

Starting with part (a). The problem gives me that the number of quantization levels M is 16. Wait, quantization levels are the different possible values the signal can take after sampling. So M being 16 means each sample is encoded into one of 16 levels. But how does that relate to the word length or the channel bandwidth?

Oh right, the word length here probably refers to the duration of each PCM word, which is the time taken to transmit each coded sample. The word length is given as 400 microseconds. So I need to find the minimum channel bandwidth required to transmit this binary PCM signal.

I think the formula related to this is the bandwidth being equal to the bit rate divided by 2. Because the Nyquist theorem says that the bandwidth must be at least half the bit rate to avoid interference between adjacent pulses. Or wait, is it the bit rate divided by 2? Or maybe it's the bit rate divided by the number of bits per sample?

Wait, let me think. The PCM process involves sampling, quantizing, and encoding. The bit rate (R) would be the number of bits per sample multiplied by the sampling rate. But wait, the sampling rate isn't given here directly. Instead, the word length is given.

Wait, the word length is the time per code word. So each code word is a certain number of bits. Since M is 16, the number of bits per sample would be log2(M). Because to represent 16 levels, you need 4 bits (since 2^4 =16). So each sample is 4 bits.

So the bit rate R would be the number of bits per second. The word length is the time for each code word, so the time per code word is 400 microseconds, which is 400e-6 seconds. So the bit rate R would be the number of bits per code word divided by the word length. Wait, number of bits per code word is 4, so R = 4 bits / 400e-6 seconds. Let me compute that.

4 / 400e-6 = 4 / 0.0004 = 10,000 bits per second. So R is 10^4 bps.

Now, the minimum channel bandwidth required is related to the bit rate. I remember that for a binary PCM signal, the bandwidth (f_c) needed is at least R/2. Oh wait, no, wait. The bandwidth is typically the highest frequency component of the signal. For binary signals, the bandwidth is R/2 because the maximum frequency is half the bit rate. Or wait, is it R? Because the bit rate is the number of bits per second, and each bit is a pulse. So the highest frequency component would be at R/2. So the bandwidth needed is R/2.

So f_c = R / 2 = 10^4 / 2 = 5,000 Hz. Wait, but none of the options for part (a) have 5e3 Hz. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: 1.26e3 Hz and 8

B: 6.12e3 and 12

C: 2e3 and 16

D:3e3 and 3

E:1.53e3 and 2

F:4e3 and 1

G: 3.56e3 and 6

H:4.53e3 and 8

I:2.53e3 and 4

J:5.06e3 and 2

Wait, none of the a options have 5e3. Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let's go back.

Wait, the word length is 400 microseconds, which is the time for one code word. So the code word is the number of bits per sample. Since M=16, bits per sample is 4. So the bit rate is (number of bits per sample) / (word length in seconds). So R = 4 / 400e-6 = 10,000 bits per second.

But wait, another approach is that the bit rate is the sampling rate multiplied by the number of bits per sample. But I don't have the sampling rate given. Alternatively, perhaps the word length is the time per bit. Wait, no, the term 'word length' in PCM usually refers to the duration of each code word, i.e., the time taken to send all the bits of one sample. So if a code word is 4 bits, then the time per code word is 400e-6 seconds, so each bit takes 100e-6 seconds.

So the bit rate R would be 1 / (bit duration) = 1 / (100e-6) = 10,000 bps. Same as before.

So the bandwidth required is R / 2, so 5,000 Hz, which is 5e3 Hz. But looking at the options, I don't see 5e3. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different.

Wait another thought: The minimum bandwidth for a PCM signal is given by the formula f_c = (n * f_s)/2, where n is the number of bits per sample and f_s is the sampling frequency.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the sampling rate. Let me think again.

The sampling rate f_s is the number of samples per second. The bit rate R is n * f_s, where n is bits per sample.

In this problem, word length is 400e-6 seconds. Word length is the time per code word, which is 1/f_s, because f_s is samples per second.

So f_s = 1 / (400e-6) = 2500 samples per second.

Wait, that would make f_s 2500 Hz. Because 1/400e-6 is 2500.

Then, the number of bits per sample is log2(M) = 4 bits.

So the bit rate R = n * f_s = 4 * 2500 = 10,000 bps, same as before.

The minimum bandwidth needed is the bit rate divided by 2, so 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 Hz, which is 5e3 Hz. But again, the options don't have 5e3 for (a). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Let me double-check the formula. Oh wait, maybe the bandwidth is R, not R/2. Because sometimes for binary PCM, the bandwidth is taken as R, but I thought it was R/2 because each bit is a pulse of certain width, but I might be getting confused with other modulation schemes.

Alternatively, maybe the question is using a different approach. Let me think: the minimum bandwidth required for a binary PCM signal without distortion is R, because the highest frequency component in a binary signal (like a square wave) is R/2, so the bandwidth must be at least R/2.

Wait, but in that case, 10,000 bps / 2 = 5,000 Hz. But none of the options match this for part (a). So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, looking at the options, the closest is option J, which is 5.06e3 and 2, but that's part (b).

Wait, let me think again. Maybe the formula is f_c = (R * 2), but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is f_c = R / (2 * log2(M)) ), but that would complicate things.

Wait, maybe the formula is f_c = (n * f_s) / 2. So n is 4, f_s is 2500, so (4*2500)/2 = 5000. So same as before.

Hmm, but none of the options for part (a) have 5e3. Let's check the options again.

Wait, looking at part (a) options:

Option C is 2e3 and 16.

Option D is 3e3 and 3.

Option G is 3.56e3 and 6.

Option H is 4.53e3 and 8.

Wait, none have 5e3. So perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe the word length isn't the same as the sample duration. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, the word length is the time for each PCM code word. So the code word is the number of bits representing a sample. So if M=16, bits per sample is 4. So each code word is 4 bits, and the time per code word is 400e-6 seconds. So the bit rate R is 4 bits / 400e-6 s = 10,000 bps.

Now, the minimum bandwidth is R/2 = 5000 Hz.

But the options don't have 5e3. So perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the minimum bandwidth is R, not R/2.

In that case, f_c = R = 10,000 Hz = 1e4 Hz, which is 10 kHz. But again, no option lists that.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f_c = (R) / (2 * log2(M)). Let's try that.

R is 1e4, log2(16)=4.

So f_c = 1e4/(2*4) )= 1e4/8 = 1250 Hz. That's 1.25e3 Hz. Looking at options, option A starts with 1.26e3, but that's close. Wait, perhaps I should calculate more accurately.

Wait, if R=1e4, then 1e4/(2*4) = 1e4/8 = 1250 Hz. So 1.25e3 Hz. Option A is 1.26e3, which is very close. But why would the formula be R/(2*log2(M))?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the formula. Maybe the formula for the minimum bandwidth is (number of bits per second) / 2. So 1e4/2 = 5e3, which is 5 kHz.

But I'm stuck because none of the options have 5e3 for part (a). So perhaps I need to look at the options again.

Wait, looking at the answer options, each option has two parts: the first is Hz, the second is the number of levels for part (b). So maybe for part (a), the correct answer is 5e3, but in the options, it's not present, which suggests I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the word length is the time per bit, not per code word. Oh wait, that's a possibility I didn't consider. Maybe I confused the terms. Let me think again.

If the word length is the time for each bit, then the bit duration is 400e-6 seconds. Then the bit rate R would be 1 / 400e-6 = 2500 bits per second. Then the number of bits per sample is 4 (since M=16), so the sampling rate f_s would be R / n = 2500 /4 = 625 samples per second.

Wait, that can't be right because 625 samples per second is very low. But let's compute the bandwidth. If R is 2500 bps, then the bandwidth would be R/2 = 1250 Hz, which is 1.25e3 Hz. That matches option A's first part, 1.26e3 Hz, which is approximately 1.25e3.

So perhaps I made a mistake earlier in assuming that the word length was the time per code word, but perhaps it's the time per bit. Hmm. What defines the word length? The term can be ambiguous, but in PCM, the word length usually refers to the duration of the entire code word, which is the time for all bits of a sample. So if a code word is 4 bits, then the time per code word is 400e-6 s, so each bit takes 100e-6 s. Hence, R is 1e4 bps.

But if the word length is the time per bit, then each bit is 400e-6 s, so R would be 2500 bps.

So this leads me to two possibilities. How can I determine which is correct?

Looking back at the question, it says "word length is 400 μsec". Word length in PCM is typically the duration of the code word, which is the time to send all the bits of one sample.

So with M=16, each sample is 4 bits, and the time per sample (code word) is 400e-6 s. So the bit rate R is 4 / 400e-6 = 1e4 bps.

Bandwidth is R/2 = 5e3 Hz. But none of the options have 5e3.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe the bandwidth is (n * f_s) / 2, where f_s is the sampling frequency.

f_s is 1 / (400e-6) = 2500 Hz.

n is 4.

So (4 * 2500) / 2 = 5000 Hz. Again, same result.

So I'm confident that part (a) requires a bandwidth of 5e3 Hz. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to the transmission bandwidth, which might involve some overhead or other factors. Or perhaps it's considering the signal as a pulse train with a certain rise time, but that's getting more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for minimum bandwidth is (number of bits per second) / 2. So 1e4 / 2 = 5e3 Hz.

But the options don't have this. So maybe I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the relationship between the bit rate and the bandwidth. The minimum bandwidth required for a binary signal is indeed the bit rate divided by 2. So 1e4 bps would require 5e3 Hz. But in the options, the closest I see is option G:3.56e3 and 6, but that's not 5e3.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the bandwidth is determined by the sampling rate, not the bit rate. Because the sampling rate is 2500 Hz, so the bandwidth would be at least the sampling rate. But that would be 2500 Hz, which is 2.5e3 Hz. Looking at the options, option C is 2e3, which is close but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the bandwidth is determined by the number of levels and the bit rate. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: The minimum bandwidth for PCM is given by:

Bandwidth (f_c) = (R + 1) / 2,

where R is the bit rate in bits per second. But I'm not sure about this formula. Alternatively, I've heard that sometimes the bandwidth is considered as R/2. So perhaps I'm correct in that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating R. Let me re-calculate.

If the word length is 400e-6 seconds, that's the time for each code word. Each code word is 4 bits, so the bit rate is 4 bits / 400e-6 s = 10,000 bps. So R=1e4.

So f_c = R / 2 = 5e3 Hz.

But I don't see 5e3 in the options. Hmm. Maybe the question intended the word length to be the bit duration, not the code word duration.

If that's the case, then each bit is 400e-6 s, so R=1/400e-6 = 2500 bps.

Then f_c = 2500/2 = 1250 Hz, which is 1.25e3 Hz. Looking at the options, option A is 1.26e3 Hz and 8. That's close.

So perhaps the correct answer for part (a) is 1.25e3 Hz, but it's approximated as 1.26e3, so option A.

Wait, but the number of quantization levels in part (b) would be M=16 initially, but when the bandwidth is halved, what happens?

Wait, part (b) says that the channel has a bandwidth half of what was found in (a). So if part (a)'s bandwidth was 5e3 Hz, then part (b)'s bandwidth would be 2.5e3 Hz. Alternatively, if part (a) was 1.25e3, then part (b) would be 625 Hz.

But let's assume for part (a), the correct answer is option A:1.26e3 Hz and 8.

Wait, but why 8? Because in part (b), when the bandwidth is halved, the number of quantization levels would change. Let's think.

In part (b), the new bandwidth is half of part (a)'s bandwidth. So if part (a) found 1.25e3 Hz, then part (b) would have 625 Hz.

Now, we need to find the new number of quantization levels M' that allows the PCM signal to pass through the channel with this reduced bandwidth.

The bit rate R is determined by the bandwidth. Since the minimum bandwidth is R/2, then R = 2 * f_c.

In part (a), R was 1e4 bps. But if part (a) was 1.25e3 Hz, then R would be 2.5e3 bps.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to clarify.

If in part (a), we've determined that f_c is 1.25e3 Hz, then the bit rate R would be 2.5e3 bps.

In part (b), the new bandwidth is half of part (a), so 625 Hz. Then, the new bit rate R' would be 2 * 625 = 1250 bps.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because if the bandwidth is halved, the bit rate would be halved. So from 2.5e3 to 1.25e3.

But how does that affect the number of quantization levels?

The bit rate R is the product of the number of bits per sample (n) and the sampling rate (f_s).

So R = n * f_s.

In part (a), with M=16, n=4 bits. The word length is 400e-6 s, so f_s = 1 / (400e-6) = 2500 Hz.

So R = 4 * 2500 = 1e4 bps.

But if in part (a), the f_c was calculated as 1.25
