Question:

What does it mean if the heritability index for a particular trait ishigh?

Options:

A: The trait will be the same across all individuals regardless of their environment
B: 90% of the variance found in the scores in the population are attributable to environmental factors
C: The trait is entirely determined by environmental factors and has no genetic basis
D: Heritability index indicates that the trait cannot be passed down from generation to generation
E: Heritability index has no connection with genetic factors
F: 70% of the variance found in the scores in the population are attributable to genetic factors
G: The trait is not influenced by any external factors and is solely determined by genetics
H: Heritability index indicates the degree of modifiability of the trait
I: 50% of the variance found in the scores in the population is due to genetic factors and the other 50% to environmental factors
J: The heritability index for the trait is a fixed value and does not vary across populations

Okay, so I have this question about heritability index, and I need to figure it out. Hmm, I remember that heritability has to do with genetics and how much traits are influenced by genes versus the environment. But wait, what exactly does the heritability index mean? I think it's a measure of how much of the variation in a trait in a population is due to genetic differences. Oh right, it's often expressed as a percentage, like 0 to 100%.

The question is asking what a high heritability index implies. So if it's high, say like 70% or 80%, that would mean most of the variation is due to genetics. But wait, I should be careful. Heritability is specific to a particular population in a specific environment. So it doesn't mean that environment doesn't play a role at all, just that in this context, genetics are a bigger factor.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The trait is the same across all individuals regardless of environment. No, that doesn't sound right. Even if heritability is high, there can be some variation due to environment, plus identical twins might still have some differences because of environmental factors. Plus, high heritability just means genetics account for a large portion of the variance, not that environment has zero effect.

Option B: 90% variance due to environment. Wait, no. High heritability would mean most is genetic. So if the index is high, say 90%, then 90% is genetic, not environment. So option B is the opposite, so it's incorrect.

Option C: The trait is entirely determined by environment, no genetics. That's the opposite of high heritability, so wrong.

Option D: The trait can't be passed down. No, heritability being high would mean it's influenced by genetics, so it can be passed on. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Heritability has no connection to genetics. That's wrong because heritability is all about the genetic contribution.

Option F: 70% variance due to genetics. So if heritability is high, say 70%, that fits. But I'm not sure if F is correct, because the question says "high" in general. Like, does high mean like 70% or more? I think F is a possible correct option.

Option G: Trait is solely determined by genetics. No, that's not right. High heritability means a large genetic influence, but environment still plays a part. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Heritability indicates modifiability. Hmm, I don't think so. Modifiability would relate to how much the environment can change the trait. But heritability is about the sources of variation, not how modifiable it is. So H is probably wrong.

Option I: 50% genetic, 50% environment. That would be a moderate heritability, not high. So I is incorrect.

Option J: Heritability is fixed across populations. No, heritability can vary in different environments. For example, in a more varied environment, the environmental influence might be higher, changing the heritability. So J is wrong.

So the correct answer should be F, because a high heritability index means a large portion (like 70%) of variance is due to genetics. But wait, what if the heritability index is 80%? Does F still apply? The question doesn't specify a particular percentage, just that it's high. So the correct statement is that a high heritability means most variance is genetic. Looking back at the options, F says 70%, which would be a high value. So F is the right choice.

A high heritability index indicates that a large portion of the variance in a trait within a population is attributable to genetic factors. This means that genetics play a significant role in the variation observed for that trait. Among the options provided, the one that aligns with this understanding is:

**F: 70% of the variance found in the scores in the population are attributable to genetic factors.**

This option correctly reflects the concept of high heritability, where a substantial percentage of the trait's variation is due to genetic influence, while still acknowledging that environmental factors may also contribute to a lesser extent.

Answer: F
