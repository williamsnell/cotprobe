Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to think it through. Alright, the question is about a proton falling through a potential, and its de Broglie wavelength. Hmm, I remember that the de Broglie wavelength is related to the momentum of a particle. Let me see.

The problem states that a proton is initially at rest and falls through a potential, which I suppose means it gains kinetic energy because it's accelerating. The de Broglie wavelength is given as 1.0e-10 meters. I need to find the potential required for that.

Wait, de Broglie wavelength formula is lambda = h / p, right? Where h is Planck's constant and p is momentum. So lambda = h/(m*v), since p is mass times velocity. But the proton starts from rest, so it's being accelerated through a potential difference, which gives it kinetic energy.

Oh right, when a charge falls through a potential V, it gains kinetic energy equal to qV. For a proton, the charge q is the elementary charge, e, which is about 1.6e-19 coulombs. The kinetic energy (KE) would then be (1/2)mv² = eV, since it starts from rest.

So I can write KE = eV = (1/2)mv². From this, I can solve for v, the velocity. Once I have v, I can plug it into the de Broglie equation to find the required potential V.

But wait, let me get all the equations straight.

First, the de Broglie wavelength: λ = h / (m*v). We can rearrange this to solve for v: v = h/(λ*m).

Then, the kinetic energy equation: KE = (1/2)mv² = eV.

So substituting v from the first equation into the second, we get:

(1/2)m*(h/(λ*m))² = eV.

Simplify that. Let's see:

(1/2) m (h²)/(λ² m²) ) = eV.

The m in the numerator cancels with one m from the denominator, so we have:

(1/2) (h²) / (λ² m) ) = eV.

Then, solving for V:

V = (h²) / (2 e m λ²).

Wait, no, let me make sure. Let me redo that substitution.

So v = h/(λ m), so v squared is h²/(λ² m²).

Then (1/2) m v² is (1/2) m * (h²/(λ² m²)) ) = (h²)/(2 λ² m).

Set that equal to eV: (h²)/(2 λ² m) ) = eV.

So solving for V: V = h² / (2 e m λ²) * (1/e) ? Wait, no. Wait, equation is:

eV = (h²) / (2 λ² m).

So V = h²/(2 e m λ²).

Wait, that makes sense. So I need to plug in the values now.

Let me get all the constants right.

h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J·s.

e is the elementary charge, 1.602e-19 C.

m is the mass of the proton, about 1.673e-27 kg.

λ is given as 1e-10 m.

So substituting:

V = ( (6.626e-34)^2 ) / ( 2 * 1.602e-19 C * 1.673e-27 kg * (1e-10 m)^2 )

Wait, let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute h squared: (6.626e-34)^2.

6.626 squared is approx (6.626)^2 ≈ 43.9. So 43.9e-68 (since (1e-34)^2 is 1e-68).

Wait, 6.626 *6.626: let me compute that more accurately. 6 *6 is 36, 0.626^2 is about 0.391, and cross terms 2*6*0.626 = 7.512. So total is approximately 36 +7.512 +0.391 = 43.903. So yeah, about 43.9e-68.

Then denominator: 2 * e * m * λ^2.

Compute 2 * 1.602e-19 *1.673e-27 = 2 * (1.602 *1.673 )e-46.

1.602 *1.673 is approx 2.68. So 2 * 2.68e-46 is 5.36e-46.

Wait, no: 1.602 *1.673: let's compute it more accurately. 1.6 *1.673 is 2.6768, plus 0.002 *1.673=0.003346. So total 2.680146. So 2.680e-19 *1e-27 is 2.68e-46, multiplied by 2 gives 5.36e-46.

Wait, no, wait. The denominator is 2 * e * m * (lambda)^2.

Wait, no, lambda is 1e-10 m, so lambda squared is (1e-10)^2 = 1e-20 m².

So the denominator is 2 * e * m * lambda^2 = 2 * (1.602e-19 C) * (1.673e-27 kg) * (1e-20 m²).

Wait, let's compute that step by step.

Compute 2 * 1.602e-19 * 1.673e-27 = 2 * (1.602 * 1.673) )e-46.

1.602 *1.673 = let's calculate this.

1.6 *1.673 = 2.6768.

0.002 *1.673 = 0.003346.

So total 2.6768 + 0.003346 = 2.680146.

So 2 * 2.680146e-46 = 5.3603e-46.

But wait, we also have the lambda squared term, which is 1e-20 m².

So the denominator becomes 5.3603e-46 * 1e-20 = 5.3603e-66.

Wait, no, because the lambda squared is (1e-10)^2 = 1e-20. So the denominator is 2*e*m*(lambda^2) = 2 * 1.602e-19 * 1.673e-27 *1e-20.

So putting the exponents together: 1e-19 *1e-27 =1e-46, multiplied by 1e-20, gives 1e-66.

So 2 * 1.602e-19 *1.673e-27 = 2 * (1.602 *1.673) *1e-46 ≈ 5.36e-46.

Then multiply by 1e-20 gives 5.36e-66.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try again.

Denominator is 2 * e * m * lambda². So:

e = 1.602e-19 C.

m =1.673e-27 kg.

lambda = 1e-10 m. So lambda squared is 1e-20 m².

So 2 * e * m * lambda^2 = 2 * (1.602e-19) * (1.673e-27) * (1e-20).

Multiply the terms:

1.602e-19 *1.673e-27 = (1.602 *1.673) * 1e-46 ≈ 2.68e-46.

Then multiply by 1e-20: 2.68e-46 *1e-20 = 2.68e-66.

Then multiply by 2: 5.36e-66.

So denominator is 5.36e-66.

Now, the numerator is h squared, which is (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 43.9e-68, which is 4.39e-67.

Wait, 6.626e-34 squared is (6.626)^2 = ~43.9, and 1e-34 squared is 1e-68. So 43.9e-68 = 4.39e-67.

So V = numerator / denominator = (4.39e-67) / (5.36e-66) ) volts.

Let me compute that division.

4.39e-67 /5.36e-66 = (4.39/5.36) * 1e-1.

Because 1e-67 /1e-66 is 1e-1.

So 4.39 divided by 5.36 is approximately 0.819.

Multiply by 1e-1 gives 0.0819 volts.

Wait, that's about 0.082 V. Looking at the options, option J is 0.082 V.

So the answer should be J.

To determine the potential through which a proton must fall to have a de Broglie wavelength of \( \lambda = 1.0 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m} \), we use the following relationships:

1. **De Broglie wavelength**:  
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{h}{mv}
   \]  
   Rearranging for velocity \( v \):  
   \[
   v = \frac{h}{\lambda m}
   \]

2. **Kinetic energy**:  
   The proton starts from rest and gains kinetic energy as it falls through the potential difference \( V \):  
   \[
   \text{KE} = eV = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
   \]  
   Substituting \( v = \frac{h}{\lambda m} \) into the kinetic energy equation:  
   \[
   eV = \frac{1}{2}m \left( \frac{h}{\lambda m} \right)^2
   \]

3. **Solving for \( V \)**:  
   Simplify the equation:  
   \[
   V = \frac{h^2}{2e m \lambda^2}
   \]

4. **Substitute constants**:  
   - Planck's constant: \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \mathrm{J \cdot s} \)  
   - Elementary charge: \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C} \)  
   - Proton mass: \( m = 1.673 \times 10^{-27} \, \mathrm{kg} \)  
   - De Broglie wavelength: \( \lambda = 1.0 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m} \)

   Compute \( h^2 \):  
   \[
   h^2 = (6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2 = 4.39 \times 10^{-67} \, \mathrm{J^2 \cdot s^2}
   \]

   Compute the denominator:  
   \[
   2e m \lambda^2 = 2 (1.602 \times 10^{-19}) (1.673 \times 10^{-27}) (1.0 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 5.36 \times 10^{-66} \, \mathrm{C \cdot kg \cdot m^2}
   \]

   Divide numerator by denominator:  
   \[
   V = \frac{4.39 \times 10^{-67}}{5.36 \times 10^{-66}} = 0.082 \, \mathrm{V}
   \]

Thus, the potential required is approximately \( 0.082 \, \mathrm{V} \), which corresponds to option **J**.
