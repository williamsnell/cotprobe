Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a chemist dissolving a protein in water and measuring the osmotic pressure. From that, we need to find the molecular weight of the protein and then calculate the freezing point depression and boiling point elevation. Hmm, I remember that osmotic pressure is related to molarity, so that should help find the molecular weight. Then, using molality for freezing and boiling points. Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, the problem states that 10 grams of an unknown protein is dissolved in a liter of water at 25°C. The osmotic pressure is 9.25 mmHg. I need to find the molecular weight. Oh right, the formula for osmotic pressure is π = iMRT, where π is osmotic pressure, i is the van 't Hoff factor, M is molarity, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature in Kelvin.

Wait, but for proteins, which are large and usually don't dissociate much in solution, i is probably 1. So I can ignore it or set it to 1. So the formula simplifies to π = MRT.

But wait, the osmotic pressure units are given in mmHg. I need to convert that to atmospheres because R is usually in L·atm/(mol·K). Right, because 1 atm is 760 mmHg. So 9.25 mmHg is 9.25 / 760 atm. Let me calculate that: 9.25 divided by 760 is approximately 0.01216 atm.

Next, temperature T is 25°C, which is 298.15 K (since 25 + 273.15). R is given as 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), so that's handy.

So plugging into π = MRT, we can solve for M. Molarity M is moles per liter. So M = π/(RT). Let's plug in the numbers: M = 0.01216 atm / (0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) * 298.15 K).

Calculating the denominator first: 0.0821 * 298.15. Let me compute that. 0.0821 * 300 is about 24.63, but since it's 298.15, a bit less. Let's compute accurately: 0.0821 * 298 = 0.0821*(300-2) = 24.63 - 0.1642 = 24.4658. So around 24.466. So M = 0.01216 / 24.466 ≈ 0.000498 mol/L. Hmm, that's about 4.98e-4 M.

Wait, but wait, the solution is 10 grams in 1 liter. So the molarity is (mass / molecular weight) / volume. So M = (10 g) / (MW * 1 L) ) = 10 / MW. So 10 / MW = 4.98e-4. Solving for MW: MW = 10 / (4.98e-4) ≈ 10 / 0.000498 ≈ 20,080 g/mol. Hmm, approximately 20,100 g/mol.

Wait, but let me redo the calculation more accurately. Let me recalculate π in atm: 9.25 mmHg * (1 atm/760 mmHg) = 9.25 /760 = approximately 0.01215789 atm.

Then M = π/(RT) = 0.01215789 / (0.0821 * 298.15). Let's compute 0.0821 *298.15 first. 0.0821 * 300 is 24.63, but minus 0.0821 *1.85 (since 298.15 is 300 -1.85). Wait, alternatively, let me do it step by step.

298.15 * 0.0821: Let me compute 298 *0.0821. 300 *0.0821 is 24.63, but 2 less? So 298 is 2 less than 300. 2 *0.0821 is 0.1642. So 24.63 - 0.1642 = 24.4658. Then add 0.15 *0.0821, which is 0.012315. So total is 24.4658 + 0.012315 ≈ 24.4781. So M = 0.01215789 / 24.4781 ≈ 0.0004973 mol/L, which is 4.973e-4 M.

Now, M is 10 g / (MW * 1 L) ) → M = 10 / MW → MW = 10 / 0.0004973 ≈ 20,120 g/mol. So around 20,100 g/mol. Looking at the options, option H is 20,100, which fits. So the molecular weight is H.

Now, the next part: calculating freezing point depression (ΔT_f) and boiling point elevation (ΔT_b). The formulas for these are ΔT_f = i * k_f * m and ΔT_b = i * k_b * m. For dilute solutions, i is 1, since the protein doesn't dissociate. So I can ignore i.

First, m is the molality, which is moles per kilogram of solvent. The solution is 10g protein in 1 L water. Assuming the density is roughly 1 kg/L, so the mass of solvent is about 1 kg. So molality m = moles solute / kg solvent. Moles solute is 10g / MW. So m = (10 / MW) / 1 kg = 10 / MW. Since MW is 20,100 g/mol, m = 10 / 20100 ≈ 0.0004973 mol/kg.

So m ≈ 4.973e-4 m.

Now, k_f is 1.86 °C/m, so ΔT_f = 1 * 1.86 * m → 1.86 * 4.973e-4 ≈ let's compute this. 1.86 * 0.0004973 ≈ 0.000925 °C. Wait, but looking at the options, H says ΔT_f is 9.3e-4 °C. Let me compute precisely:

4.973e-4 m *1.86 = (4.973 *1.86) e-4. 4.973 *1.86 → let's compute: 4 *1.86 =7.44, 0.973 *1.86 = approx 1.808. So total approximately 7.44 +1.808=9.248 → 9.248e-4 °C. So 9.25e-4, which is about 9.3e-4 when rounded, as option H says. So ΔT_f is about 9.3e-4.

Similarly, ΔT_b = 1 * 0.52 * m → 0.52 * 4.973e-4 = 0.52 * 0.0004973 ≈ 0.0002585 °C, which is 2.585e-4. Wait, but option H says 2.59e-4, which matches. So that's correct.

So the molecular weight is about 20,100, which is option H. The ΔT_f is 9.3e-4 and ΔT_b 2.59e-4. So the correct answer is H.

To solve the problem, we start by using the osmotic pressure formula:

\[
\pi = MRT
\]

where:
- \( \pi \) is the osmotic pressure in atm,
- \( M \) is the molarity in mol/L,
- \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \),
- \( T \) is the temperature in Kelvin.

### Step 1: Convert osmotic pressure to atm
The osmotic pressure is given as \( 9.25 \, \text{mmHg} \). Converting to atm:

\[
\pi = \frac{9.25}{760} \approx 0.01216 \, \text{atm}.
\]

### Step 2: Solve for molarity (\( M \))
The temperature is \( 25^\circ \text{C} \), which is \( 298.15 \, \text{K} \). Substituting into \( \pi = MRT \):

\[
M = \frac{\pi}{RT} = \frac{0.01216}{0.0821 \times 298.15}.
\]

First, calculate the denominator:

\[
0.0821 \times 298.15 \approx 24.4781.
\]

Thus:

\[
M = \frac{0.01216}{24.4781} \approx 0.0004973 \, \text{mol/L}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate molecular weight (\( MW \))
The molarity is related to the molecular weight by:

\[
M = \frac{\text{mass}}{MW \times \text{volume}}.
\]

Here, the mass of the protein is \( 10 \, \text{g} \), and the volume is \( 1 \, \text{L} \). Solving for \( MW \):

\[
MW = \frac{\text{mass}}{M \times \text{volume}} = \frac{10}{0.0004973} \approx 20,100 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate freezing point depression (\( \Delta T_f \))
The freezing point depression is given by:

\[
\Delta T_f = i \cdot k_f \cdot m,
\]

where:
- \( i = 1 \) (no dissociation),
- \( k_f = 1.86^\circ \text{C/m} \),
- \( m \) is the molality.

Molality \( m \) is calculated as:

\[
m = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{kilograms of solvent}} = \frac{M \times \text{volume}}{1 \, \text{kg}} = 0.0004973 \, \text{mol/kg}.
\]

Substituting into \( \Delta T_f \):

\[
\Delta T_f = 1 \cdot 1.86 \cdot 0.0004973 \approx 0.000925^\circ \text{C} \approx 9.3 \times 10^{-4} \, ^\circ \text{C}.
\]

### Step 5: Calculate boiling point elevation (\( \Delta T_b \))
The boiling point elevation is given by:

\[
\Delta T_b = i \cdot k_b \cdot m,
\]

where:
- \( i = 1 \),
- \( k_b = 0.52^\circ \text{C/m} \),
- \( m = 0.0004973 \, \text{mol/kg} \).

Substituting:

\[
\Delta T_b = 1 \cdot 0.52 \cdot 0.0004973 \approx 0.0002585^\circ \text{C} \approx 2.59 \times 10^{-4} \, ^\circ \text{C}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The molecular weight of the protein is approximately \( 20,100 \, \text{g/mol} \), with a freezing point depression of \( 9.3 \times 10^{-4} \, ^\circ \text{C} \) and a boiling point elevation of \( 2.59 \times 10^{-4} \, ^\circ \text{C} \). This matches option **H**.
