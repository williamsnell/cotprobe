Question:

The probability that there will be an accident on Highway 48 each day depends on the weather. If the weather is dry that day, there is a 0.2% chance of an accident on Highway 48; if the weather is wet that day, there is a 1.0% chance of an accident. Today, the weather station announced that there is a 20% chance of the weather being wet. What is the probability that there will be an accident on Highway 48 today?

Options:

A: 0.006
B: 0.009
C: 0.0016
D: 0.007
E: 0.008
F: 0.005
G: 0.004
H: 0.0004
I: 0.0036
J: 0.002

Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the problem is about the probability of an accident on Highway 48 depending on the weather. The question gives me two scenarios: one when the weather is dry and another when it's wet. On a dry day, the chance of an accident is 0.2%, and on a wet day, it's 1.0%. Then, I'm told that today, there's a 20% chance the weather will be wet. I need to find the overall probability of an accident today.

Hmm, I remember that when events are dependent on conditions like this, we might have to use conditional probabilities. Wait, maybe it's about the law of total probability? Yeah, that sounds right. The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of each scenario multiplied by the probability of the scenario itself.

So, let me break it down. There are two possible weather conditions: wet and dry. Since the weather can't be both wet and dry at the same time, these are mutually exclusive and exhaustive cases. That means the total probability is just the sum of the probabilities of each case leading to an accident.

First, the probability that it's wet today is 20%, which is 0.2. And the probability of an accident given wet weather is 1.0%, so that's 0.01. So for the wet case, the combined probability is 0.2 multiplied by 0.01. Let me calculate that: 0.2 * 0.01 equals 0.002.

Next, the dry weather case. Since there's a 20% chance of wet, the chance of dry must be 100% - 20% = 80%, which is 0.8. The probability of an accident on a dry day is 0.2%, which is 0.002. So the combined probability for the dry case is 0.8 multiplied by 0.002. Let me do that math: 0.8 * 0.002 equals 0.0016.

Wait, so now I have two probabilities: 0.002 for wet days and 0.0016 for dry days. To get the total probability of an accident today, I just add these two together. So 0.002 + 0.0016 equals 0.0036.

Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. 0.2 times 0.01 is indeed 0.002. And 0.8 times 0.002 is 0.0016. Adding them together gives 0.0036. That seems correct.

Looking at the answer options, option I is 0.0036. So I think that's the correct answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up any numbers. Another way to think about it is to convert the percentages to decimals correctly. 20% is 0.2, and 80% is 0.8. Accident probabilities are 1% (0.01) and 0.2% (0.002). Yep, that's right.

Alternatively, I could write the formula for total probability. Let me denote:

P(A) = probability of accident = P(A|wet) * P(wet) + P(A|dry) * P(dry)

So plugging in the numbers: P(A) = (0.01)(0.2) + (0.002)(0.8) = 0.002 + 0.0016 = 0.0036.

Yes, that confirms it. So the correct answer is option I.

The probability of an accident on Highway 48 today depends on the weather conditions. On a wet day, the probability of an accident is 1.0% (0.01), and on a dry day, it is 0.2% (0.002). The weather station predicts a 20% (0.2) chance of wet weather and an 80% (0.8) chance of dry weather. Using the law of total probability, the overall probability of an accident is calculated as:

\[
P(\text{Accident}) = P(\text{Accident | Wet}) \cdot P(\text{Wet}) + P(\text{Accident | Dry}) \cdot P(\text{Dry})
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
P(\text{Accident}) = (0.01 \cdot 0.2) + (0.002 \cdot 0.8) = 0.002 + 0.0016 = 0.0036
\]

Thus, the probability of an accident on Highway 48 today is **0.0036**, which corresponds to option **I**.
