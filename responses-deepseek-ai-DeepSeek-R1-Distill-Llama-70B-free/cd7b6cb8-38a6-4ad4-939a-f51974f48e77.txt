Question:

A man decided to stop at a drive-through hamburger stand for a late snack. As he drove up to the drive- through line, the manager of the hamburger stand informed him through the intercom system that the restaurant was closing and no further orders would be accepted. She told the man that the last car to be served was the one directly in front of him. The man became angry and yelled into the intercom machine, "Listen, babe, I am hungry. I want two cheeseburgers, a large order of fries, and a Coke. " The manager retorted, "I'm terribly sorry, but we cannot accept your order. "Shortly thereafter, the manager handed the food order to the passengers in the car immediately in front of the man's. When the man saw the manager serving that car, he became very angry, drove his automobile up to the service window and shouted at the manager, "You can't do this to me. " When the manager laughed, the man suddenly reached into the car's glove compartment and pulled out a gun. He aimed at the manager and fired the weapon, intending to hit her. The bullet missed the manager but hit a customer, wounding him in the head. In an action by the customer against the man for battery, the customer will be

C: unsuccessful, because the manager could have prevented the situation by accepting the man's order.
D: successful, because the man was acting recklessly and created a dangerous situation.
E: unsuccessful, because the man could not foresee that the bullet would hit anyone other than the manager.
F: unsuccessful, because the man was provoked by the manager's refusal to serve him.
G: unsuccessful, because the man did not intend to shoot the customer.
H: successful, because there was a "substantial certainty" that the customer would be hit by the bullet.
I: successful, because the man intended to shoot the manager.
J: successful, because the bullet from the man's gun directly caused the customer's injury.

Okay, so I've got this question about tort law, specifically battery. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The situation is a man gets angry at a drive-through because they won't take his order. He ends up shooting at the manager but misses and hits another customer, wounding him. The customer is suing the man for battery.

First, I remember that battery is an intentional tort. The elements are intentional act, harmful or offensive contact, and causation. So the key here is intent. The man intended to shoot the manager, but he hit the customer instead.

Wait, but in tort law, there's something called "transferred intent." I think that's when the intent to harm one person transfers to another who is actually harmed. So if I aim at person A but hit person B, the intent transfers, making me liable for battery against B.

So in this case, the man intended to shoot the manager, but the bullet hit the customer. So under transferred intent, the intent to harm the manager would transfer to the customer. That would mean the man is liable for battery against the customer, even though he wasn't aiming at him.

Looking at the options:

Option A says successful because harm was caused regardless of intent. But battery requires intent, so this might not be right.

Option B says unsuccessful because he wasn't aiming at the customer. But transferred intent says that's not necessary.

Option D mentions recklessness. While reckless conduct can lead to negligence, battery is about intent. So maybe not the best fit.

Option G says unsuccessful because he didn't intend to shoot the customer. But transferred intent makes that irrelevant.

Option I says successful because he intended to shoot the manager. That's exactly the transferred intent scenario.

Option H talks about substantial certainty, which is more about recklessness and maybe negligent battery, but I think transferred intent applies here.

So the correct answer should be I. Because even though he was aiming at the manager, the intent transfers to the customer he actually hit.

The question revolves around tort law, specifically the concept of battery. Battery requires an intentional act, harmful or offensive contact, and causation. The man intended to shoot the manager but missed and hit the customer. Under the doctrine of transferred intent, the intent to harm one person (the manager) transfers to the person actually harmed (the customer). This makes the man liable for battery against the customer, even though he was not aiming at them.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. Battery requires intent, which is present here through transferred intent.
- **B**: Incorrect. Transferred intent applies even if the man wasn't aiming at the customer.
- **D**: Incorrect. Battery is about intent, not recklessness.
- **G**: Incorrect. Intent is present through transferred intent.
- **I**: Correct. The intent to shoot the manager transfers to the customer.
- **H**: Incorrect. This relates to recklessness, not transferred intent.
- **J**: Incorrect. Causation is present, but the key is the intent, which is addressed by transferred intent.

The correct answer is **I**, as the man's intent to shoot the manager transfers to the customer under the doctrine of transferred intent.

Answer: I
