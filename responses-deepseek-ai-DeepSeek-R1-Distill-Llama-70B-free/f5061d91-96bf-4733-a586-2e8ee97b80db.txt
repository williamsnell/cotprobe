Okay, so I've got this question about T4 phages and E. coli strains. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, let's read the question again. So, the setup is that T4 phages with mutations in the rII region can lyse E. coli strain B but not strain K. Wait, no, wait. If the phage has a mutation in rII, they can't infect K? Or is it the other way around? Wait, I remember that the rII mutants can infect strain B but not K. Because the rII region is about host range. So wild-type phages can infect both B and K, but mutants in rII can't infect K. So if a phage has a mutation in rII, it can't lyse K, only B.

So the experiment is: They infect a plate of E. coli B with two types of mutant phage. So both phages have mutations in rII, but I guess they're different mutations. The resulting lysate is split in half. One half is diluted 1e7 and plated on B. The other half is diluted 1e5 and plated on K. On K, they found 4 plaques, on B, 40.

We need to find the amount of recombination between the two mutations.

Wait, so this must be about phage crosses. When two phages infect the same bacterium, they can undergo recombination. So the two parent phages are mutants in rII, let's say one is rIIA and the other is rIIB. When they infect E. coli B (which they can), they can recombine. The recombinants would have a functional rII gene, allowing them to infect E. coli K.

So the initial lysate has phages that are either parental (rIIA or rIIB) or recombinant (wild-type rII). The lysate is split into two. One part is diluted more (1e7) and plated on B. The other is less diluted (1e5) and plated on K.

Wait, but why would they plate on K? Because only the recombinants can form plaques on K. Because the parental phages can't infect K. So the number of plaques on K should correspond to the number of recombinant phages in the lysate.

Similarly, when they plate on B, both the parental and the recombinant can infect, so the number of plaques there would be higher.

Let me think about the calculations.

So, let's say the total lysate has N phages. After dilution, the amount on each plate reflects the concentration.

But perhaps a better approach is to think in terms of the number of phages in each case.

Wait, the lysate is split in half. Let's say each half is volume V. Then, one half is diluted 1e7, so the concentration becomes (number of phages in half lysate) / (1e7 * V). Similarly, the other is diluted 1e5, so concentration is (number in half lysate) / (1e5 * V).

But when they plate, they spread a certain volume. Let's say they plate all of the diluted sample. The number of plaques is determined by the number of phages in the sample.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to find the ratio of recombinant phages in the lysate. Because the number of plaques on K gives the number of wild-type (recombinant) phages, while the number on B gives total phages (since all can infect B).

Wait, but the two halves are from the same lysate but diluted differently. So when you plate on K, you only see the recombinants. On B, you see all phages.

Wait, no. Wait. Let me clarify:

The lysate after infection contains three types of phages: parental type 1 (rIIA), parental type 2 (rIIB), and recombinant (rII+). The recombinant can infect both B and K, the parents can only infect B.

So when you plate the lysate on B, you get all the phages — parents and recombinants. When you plate on K, you only get the recombinants.

So the number of plaques on K is the number of recombinant phages in that diluted sample. Similarly, the number on B is the number of total phages in that diluted sample.

So let's think about the dilutions. Let me denote:

Total lysate volume is V. Each half is V/2.

Half is diluted 1e7. The other half is diluted 1e5.

When you dilute 1e7, the concentration becomes (number of phages in half lysate) / (V/2 * 1e7). But when you plate, you spread a certain volume. Let's assume they plate 1 ml or some volume, but perhaps the exact volume cancels out.

But perhaps a better approach is to compute the number of phages in each diluted sample.

Wait, suppose that the total number of phages in the lysate is P.

So each half has P/2 phages.

Wait, no. The lysate is split into two halves. Each half has (number of phages) / 2.

But when they dilute, the concentration changes. So when they take half the lysate and dilute it 1e7 times, the number of phages per ml is (original concentration) * (1/1e7).

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the diluted samples.

Let me denote:

Let T be the total number of phages in the entire lysate.

So each half has T/2 phages.

When you dilute the first half by 1e7, the concentration becomes (T/2) / (1e7 * V), where V is the volume after dilution. But to find the number of phages in the volume that is plated, say, assuming the same volume is plated each time, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of phages per plate.

Wait, perhaps another approach: let's say the first half is diluted 1e7. So the number of phages in the diluted sample is (T/2) / 1e7. Then, when plated on B, the number of plaques is (T/2)/(1e7) * efficiency, but wait, all phages can infect B, so the count is (T/2)/(1e7) * volume? Hmm, perhaps not. Maybe the number of phages applied is (T/2) / (1e7) multiplied by the volume plated. But the question states that 40 plaques were found on B, and 4 on K.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio of recombinant phages to the total.

Wait, let me think again. Let's define R as the number of recombinant phages in the entire lysate. So the total phages are T = P1 + P2 + R, where P1 and P2 are the two parental types. But since they started with two parent phages, the total would be the sum of both parents plus any recombinants. But perhaps the initial number of each parent is the same because they were infected with equal amounts, but I'm not sure. Hmm.

Wait, but in the lysate, the number of each parent should be roughly equal, assuming equal input. But when they infect, each infection can lead to lysis and release of phages. But the exact numbers might not matter if we're looking for the proportion that's recombinant.

So when you plate on K, only R phages can form plaques. On B, all phages can form plaques.

But the lysate is split into two: one part is diluted 1e7 and plated on B, giving 40 plaques. The other is diluted 1e5 and plated on K, giving 4 plaques.

So for the sample plated on K: the number of phages in that sample is (R / 2) / 1e5. Because the lysate is split in half, so each half has R/2 recombinant phages. Then, when diluted 1e5 times, the concentration becomes (R/2)/(1e5 * V), but assuming they plate a volume V, the number of phages would be (R/2)/(1e5) * V_plated, but perhaps V_plated is the same for both plates.

Wait, but the actual number of plaques on K is 4. So 4 = (R/2) / (1e5) * (volume plated). Similarly, on B, 40 = (T/2) / (1e7) * (volume plated).

Wait, but if the volume plated is the same for both, then we can set up a ratio.

Let me write the equations.

Let’s let N be the number of phages in the entire lysate. So N = P1 + P2 + R, where P1 and P2 are the two parents, and R is the recombinant.

But perhaps more accurately, when you have two parent phages infecting, the number of each parent in the lysate will be approximately equal because you start with similar numbers. So P1 ≈ P2. Let's say each is about (N - R)/2 each.

But perhaps N is the total phages in the lysate.

So when we take half the lysate, we have N/2 total phages. The number of recombinants in that half is R/2.

When you dilute by 1e7 and plate on B, you get 40 plaques. The number of phages in that diluted sample is (N/2) / 1e7. But when you plate, you get 40 plaques, which equals the number of phages you applied, assuming each phage makes a plaque.

Wait, but wait. The number of plaques on B is 40. So 40 = (N/2) / (1e7) * volume_plated. Similarly, the number on K is 4 = (R/2) / (1e5) * volume_plated.

But the volume plated is the same for both, let's call it V_p.

So we can write:

40 = (N/2) * V_p / 1e7

4 = (R/2) * V_p / 1e5

Let me solve for V_p from the first equation.

V_p = (40 * 1e7) / (N/2) ) → V_p = (40 * 2e7) / N → V_p = 8e8 / N

Wait, no. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, 40 = ( (N/2) / 1e7 ) * V_p

So → V_p = (40 * 1e7) / (N/2) ) → V_p = (40 * 1e7 * 2) / N → V_p = 8e8 / N

Similarly, from the second equation:

4 = ( (R/2) / 1e5 ) * V_p

So → V_p = (4 * 1e5) / (R/2) ) → V_p = (4 * 1e5 * 2) / R → V_p = 8e5 / R

Now, since both expressions equal V_p, set them equal:

8e8 / N = 8e5 / R → 8e8 R = 8e5 N → R = (8e5 /8e8) N → R = (1e-3) N → R = 0.1% N

Wait, that's 0.1% of the total phages are recombinant. So the recombination frequency is 0.1%.

Looking at the options, D is 0.1 percent.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations. Because 8e8 / N = 8e5 / R → (8e8 * R) = (8e5 * N) → R = (8e5 /8e8) N → 8e5 is 8*1e5, 8e8 is 8*1e8. So 8e5 /8e8 = 1e5/1e8 = 1e-3 → 0.001 → 0.1% → yes, D.

But wait, another way to think. The number of recombinants is R. The total is N. So R/N = 0.001 → 0.1% recombination.

So the answer should be D.

To determine the amount of recombination between the two mutations in the rII region of the T4 genome, we analyze the experimental setup:

1. **Key Observations**:  
   - T4 phages with mutations in the rII region can infect E. coli strain B but not strain K.  
   - Recombinant phages (with a functional rII gene) can infect both strains.  
   - The lysate contains three types of phages: two parental mutants (rIIA and rIIB) and recombinants (rII+).  
   - When plated on K, only recombinants form plaques. When plated on B, all phages (parents and recombinants) form plaques.  

2. **Experimental Data**:  
   - The lysate is split into two halves.  
   - One half is diluted 1:10⁷ and plated on B, yielding 40 plaques.  
   - The other half is diluted 1:10⁵ and plated on K, yielding 4 plaques.  

3. **Analysis**:  
   - Let \( T \) represent the total number of phages in the entire lysate, and \( R \) represent the number of recombinant phages.  
   - When plated on B, the number of plaques reflects the total phages in the diluted sample:  
     \[
     40 = \frac{T/2}{10^7} \implies T = 40 \times 2 \times 10^7 = 8 \times 10^8 \, \text{phages}.
     \]  
   - When plated on K, the number of plaques reflects only the recombinant phages in the diluted sample:  
     \[
     4 = \frac{R/2}{10^5} \implies R = 4 \times 2 \times 10^5 = 8 \times 10^5 \, \text{phages}.
     \]  

4. **Recombination Frequency**:  
   The recombination frequency is the ratio of recombinant phages to the total phages:  
   \[
   \text{Recombination Frequency} = \frac{R}{T} \times 100 = \frac{8 \times 10^5}{8 \times 10^8} \times 100 = 0.1\%.
   \]  

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The amount of recombination between the two mutations in the rII region is **0.1%**.
