Question:

A 43-year-old man with a history of self-mutilation comes to the emergency department because of pain in his right thigh and shaking chills during the past 3 days. He says he intentionally burned his right thigh several times with a cigarette lighter 6 days ago. This morning he soaked his thigh in a tub of hot water and massaged it, after which a large amount of "greenish fluid" drained from the wound sites. The patient normally takes lithium carbonate but stopped 3 months ago after he lost his job. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable. Vital signs are temperature 39.2°C (102.5°F), pulse 170/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows an edematous right lateral thigh with multiple burn sites with a white exudative appearance. There is erythema surrounding the burn areas with red streaks extending up the thigh. Palpation of the burn sites discloses fluctuance. Results of laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 14 g/dL and a leukocyte count of 19,000/mm3 . In addition to beginning antibiotic therapy, which of the following is the most appropriate next step?

Options:

A: Application of a pressure bandage
B: Intravenous fluid resuscitation
C: Recommencement of lithium carbonate treatment
D: Transfer to a burn center
E: Thrombolytic therapy
F: Immediate surgical amputation
G: Physical therapy consultation
H: Psychiatric consultation
I: Topical silver sulfadiazine
J: Incision and drainage

Alright, let's tackle this question step by step. Okay, so the patient is a 43-year-old man with a history of self-mutilation. He comes to the ED with thigh pain and chills for the past three days. He burned his thigh with a cigarette lighter six days ago. This morning, after soaking and massaging, greenish fluid drained. He was on lithium but stopped three months ago.

Looking at his vital signs: high fever at 39.2°C, tachycardia with pulse 170, which is really high. Respirations are 18, and BP is 120/60. Physical exam shows edema, multiple burns with white exudate, erythema, red streaks, and fluctuance on palpation. Labs show elevated leukocytes at 19k, so he's definitely got an infection.

So, what's going on here? He's got burns, but he's also been treating them himself by soaking and massaging, which probably made things worse. The greenish fluid suggests pus, and the fluctuance indicates an abscess. Red streaks might mean cellulitis or lymphangitis. His vitals show he's septic—high fever, tachycardia, maybe hypotension.

The question is about the next appropriate step after starting antibiotics. The options are from A to J.

Let's go through the options:

A: Pressure bandage. Hmm, not sure. Pressure might not help if there's an abscess. Maybe not the first step.

B: IV fluids. He's septic, so fluid resuscitation is important. But the question is what's the next step besides antibiotics.

C: Restart lithium. He stopped because he lost his job, but he's in acute distress now. Restarting lithium isn't the immediate concern here. Probably not the answer.

D: Transfer to burn center. Maybe, but let's see other options first.

E: Thrombolytic therapy. That's for clots, not abscess or infection. Not relevant here.

F: Immediate amputation. That's a big step. He's got an infection, but unless it's life-threatening, maybe not.

G: Physical therapy. Not relevant in acute setting.

H: Psychiatric consult. His history is important, but the immediate issue is the infection. Maybe later, not next step.

I: Topical silver sulfadiazine. That's for burns to prevent infection, but he already has an infection. Plus, if there's an abscess, topical won't help.

J: Incision and drainage. Since the burns have fluctuance, that's an abscess. He's septic, so source control is crucial. So, I&D is necessary.

So, the most appropriate next step after starting antibiotics is to drain the abscess. So the answer is J.
</think>

The patient presents with signs of a severe infection, including fever, tachycardia, leukocytosis, and physical findings consistent with an abscess (fluctuance) and cellulitis. The history of self-inflicted burns and subsequent drainage of greenish fluid further supports the presence of an infected abscess. While antibiotics are necessary, source control is critical in managing septic patients. Incision and drainage (I&D) of the abscess is the most appropriate next step to remove the infectious source and improve the patient's condition.

The answer is J.
