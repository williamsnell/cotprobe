Question:

A psychologist conducts an experiment in which subjects are asked to learn a series of “facts” which are actually statements that have been fabricated by the research team. The subjects consist of undergraduate students at the university where the experiment is being conducted. The subjects are randomly assigned to groups that are compensated either $10 or $20 for their participation, are given either 15 minutes or 30 minutes to learn the facts, and are asked to recall the facts either in the same room in which they learned the facts or in a very different, unfamiliar setting. Which of the following are dependent variables in this experiment?
I. The amount the subjects were compensated.
II. The room in which the subjects were asked to recall facts.
III. The number of facts the subjects can recall.
IV. The time the subjects were given to learn the facts.

Options:

A: I and II only
B: III only
C: I, II, and III only
D: II, III, and IV only
E: I and IV only
F: I and III and IV only
G: I, III, and IV only
H: II and IV only
I: II only
J: I, II, and IV only

Okay, so I've got this question about experimental design, specifically identifying dependent variables. Hmm, let me think through this. 

Alright, the scenario is a psychology experiment where subjects learn fabricated facts. The subjects are undergrads from the university. They're assigned randomly to different groups. The variables being changed are compensation amount ($10 or $20), time to learn (15 or 30 minutes), and the recall setting (same room or different). The question is asking which of the options are dependent variables.

Wait, dependent variables are the outcomes measured, right? They're the results that we're observing because of the independent variables. Independent variables are the ones the experimenter changes to see the effect.

Looking at the options I to IV:

I. The amount compensated. That's an independent variable because the experimenter is changing it to see if higher pay affects something. So I is independent, not dependent.

II. The room where recall happens. Again, the experimenter is varying this condition, so it's another independent variable. So II is independent.

III. The number of facts recalled. Oh, this is definitely what we're measuring as the outcome. So this must be the dependent variable. So III is dependent.

IV. The time given to learn. That's also something the experimenter sets, so it's an independent variable. IV is independent.

So the question is which are dependent variables. The only one is III. So the correct options should include only III. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option B says III only. So the answer should be B.

The question involves identifying the dependent variables in an experiment where subjects learn fabricated facts under varying conditions. Dependent variables are the outcomes measured, while independent variables are the factors manipulated by the experimenter.

- **I. The amount the subjects were compensated**: This is an independent variable because it is manipulated by the experimenter.
- **II. The room in which the subjects were asked to recall facts**: This is also an independent variable as it is varied by the experimenter.
- **III. The number of facts the subjects can recall**: This is the dependent variable because it is the outcome being measured.
- **IV. The time the subjects were given to learn the facts**: This is an independent variable as it is set by the experimenter.

The only dependent variable is **III**, so the correct answer is **B: III only**.

B
