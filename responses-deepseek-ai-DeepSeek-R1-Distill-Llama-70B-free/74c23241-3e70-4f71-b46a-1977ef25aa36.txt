Okay, so I've got this question about statistical significance and power, and I'm a bit rusty on my stats, but let's see if I can work through it. The question says that a researcher set the criterion for statistical significance at 0.05 and the statistical power at 0.85. I need to pick the correct statement from the options A to J.

First, I remember that in hypothesis testing, there are two types of errors. Type I error is when you reject a true null hypothesis, and Type II error is when you fail to reject a false null hypothesis. The probability of Type I error is denoted by alpha (α), and Type II error by beta (β). 

The significance level, alpha, is set by the researcher. In this case, it's 0.05. So the probability of a Type I error is 0.05. That's a common cutoff used because it means there's a 5% chance of making that error.

Then there's statistical power, which is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it's false. Power is denoted as 1 - β. So if the power is 0.85, that means β (Type II error) is 1 - 0.85 = 0.15 or 15%.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the statistical power is less than the significance criterion. But 0.85 is greater than 0.05, so A is wrong.

Option B says the probability of Type II error is 0.85. Wait, no. Because power is 0.85, which is 1 - β. So β is 0.15. So B is incorrect.

Option C claims Type II error is 0.05. No, that's the Type I error. So C is wrong.

Option D says we can't compute the errors from the info given. But we were given alpha (0.05) and power (0.85), so we can find both Type I (alpha) and Type II (beta=0.15) errors. So D is wrong.

Option E says Type I and II errors are equal. That would mean alpha equals beta, but 0.05 isn't equal to 0.15. So E is wrong.

Option F says Type I error is 0.85. No, Type I is 0.05, so F is incorrect.

Option G says Type I error is lower than Type II. Wait, Type I is 0.05, Type II is 0.15. So 0.05 is lower than 0.15. So G would be correct. Let me check the options again.

Wait, option H says Type II error is higher than Type I. Yes, since 0.15 > 0.05. So H is correct. Wait, but I thought G said the opposite? Let me read again.

Option G: The probability of making a type I error is lower than the probability of making a type II error.

H says Type II is higher than Type I. Both are correct statements. Wait, no. Because Type I is 0.05, Type II is 0.15, so Type II is higher. So both G and H are correct in what they're saying, but looking at the options, which one is presented.

Wait, let me re-read the options.

Option G: The probability of making a type I error is lower than the probability of making a type II error. So yes, because 0.05 < 0.15. So G is correct.

Option H: The probability of making a type II error is higher than the probability of making a type I error. Which is also correct because 0.15 > 0.05.

Wait, so both G and H are correct? That can't be right because they're different options. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait no, in the question, the power is 0.85, so beta is 0.15. So Type II error is 0.15, Type I is 0.05. So Type II is higher than Type I. So H is correct. G is also correct because Type I is lower than Type II.

Wait, but that would mean both G and H are correct, which can't be the case because it's a multiple-choice with single answer. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, no, the question is which statement is correct. So let me look at the options again.

Option B: Probability of Type II error is 0.85. No, because power is 0.85, so Type II is 0.15.

Option H says Type II error is higher than Type I. Which is correct because 0.15>0.05.

So H is correct.

Wait, but in the options, option B is incorrect. So looking back:

The question is, which of the options is correct?

So the correct statements would be:

- Type I error (alpha) is 0.05.

- Type II error (beta) is 0.15.

So looking at the options, which one matches.

Looking at the options:

Option B: Probability of Type II error is 0.85 → No, it's 0.15.

Option H: Probability of Type II error is higher than Type I → Yes, 0.15>0.05.

So H is correct.

Wait, but another option: Option A is about power less than significance, which is wrong.

Option D: Can't compute errors. No, because we have both.

So the correct answer should be H.

Wait, but let me check the other options again. Option H is correct.

The question involves understanding the relationship between statistical significance, power, Type I errors, and Type II errors. The criterion for statistical significance (α) is set to 0.05, meaning the probability of making a Type I error is 0.05. Statistical power is given as 0.85, which represents the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis. Power is calculated as \( \text{Power} = 1 - \beta \), where \( \beta \) is the probability of making a Type II error. Thus, \( \beta = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15 \).

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Statistical power (0.85) is greater than the significance criterion (0.05).
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The probability of a Type II error (\( \beta \)) is 0.15, not 0.85.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The probability of a Type II error is 0.15, not 0.05.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Both Type I (\( \alpha = 0.05 \)) and Type II (\( \beta = 0.15 \)) errors can be computed from the given information.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. Type I and Type II errors are not equal (\( \alpha \neq \beta \)).
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The probability of a Type I error is 0.05, not 0.85.
- **Option G**: Correct. The probability of a Type I error (0.05) is lower than the probability of a Type II error (0.15).
- **Option H**: Correct. The probability of a Type II error (0.15) is higher than the probability of a Type I error (0.05).
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The probability of a Type I error is 0.05, not 0.15.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. Statistical power (0.85) is not equal to the significance criterion (0.05).

Both **Option G** and **Option H** are valid, but since the question requires selecting only one correct answer, **Option H** is the most appropriate because it directly compares the probabilities of Type I and Type II errors.

Answer: H
