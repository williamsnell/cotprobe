Okay, so I'm trying to solve this combustion problem, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the steps. But I'll give it a shot. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about the combustion of a hydrocarbon. The air used is at 25°C and 100 kPa with 48% relative humidity. We need to find two things: (a) the carbon/hydrogen ratio of the fuel on a mass basis and (b) the percent theoretical air employed. The products of combustion are given as CO2 13.0%, O2 3.1%, CO 0.3%, and N2 83.6% on a dry basis.

Hmm. I remember that when a hydrocarbon burns, the products are typically CO2, H2O, O2 (if there's excess air), N2 (from the air), and maybe some CO if it's incomplete combustion. Since the problem gives the dry basis, that means the water vapor has been removed, so I don't have to deal with H2O in the analysis.

First, I think I should determine the actual air used in the combustion process. But wait, the question is about the percent theoretical air, so I need to compare the actual air used to the theoretical (stoichiometric) air required.

Wait, but the air is provided with humidity—48% relative humidity. So the air isn't dry. That might affect the calculations because part of the air's mass or volume is water vapor.

Let me outline the steps I think I should take:

1. **Determine the composition of the combustion products on a dry basis.**
   The given data is already on a dry basis, so I can work with that. The products are CO2 (13%), O2 (3.1%), CO (0.3%), and N2 (83.6%). So the sum is 13 + 3.1 + 0.3 +83.6 = 100%, which checks out.

2. **Assume the hydrocarbon is CxHy.**
   The general combustion equation for a hydrocarbon is:
   CxHy + (a) O2 + (b) N2 → (c) CO2 + (d) H2O + (e) O2 + (f) N2 + (g) CO

   Wait, but in this case, H2O is not in the products because it's a dry analysis, so maybe it's condensed? Or perhaps it's considered separately. Hmm, not sure. Maybe I should approach this using mole balances.

3. **Using mole balances:**
   Let's consider the combustion reaction. The fuel is CxHy. The air is supplied with some humidity, so the air is a mixture of dry air and water vapor.

   But wait, the problem gives the air's humidity. So the air is not dry. That might complicate things because the moisture in the air will contribute to the H2O in the products. But since the product analysis is on a dry basis, perhaps I should account for the H2O from both the fuel and the air's humidity.

   Alternatively, maybe it's easier to work on a dry air basis for the combustion and then adjust for the humidity.

   Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the amount of water in the air first.

   Wait, the question is about the mass of fuel and the air used. Since the air has humidity, the total mass of the air includes water vapor.

4. **Calculate the actual moles of each product.**
   Let me think. Let's say the total moles in the dry products are 100% (as given), so I can assume a basis of 100 moles of dry products.

   So, in that case:
   - CO2: 13 moles
   - O2: 3.1 moles
   - CO: 0.3 moles
   - N2: 83.6 moles

   Now, the total moles of dry products are 100.

   Wait, but the combustion also produces H2O, which isn't in the dry products. So maybe I need to account for the H2O separately. Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky.

5. **Carbon and Hydrogen balances:**
   The carbon in the fuel goes into CO2 and CO. So the moles of C in the fuel (CxHy) would be x = moles of CO2 + moles of CO.

   Similarly, the hydrogen in the fuel goes into H2O. But since the product analysis is dry, the H2O isn't included. So how can I find the H?

   Alternatively, maybe I can consider the combustion equation more carefully.

   Let me write the general combustion equation for CxHy:

   CxHy + ( (x + (y/4)) * O2 ) → x CO2 + (y/2) H2O )

   But in reality, when air is involved, it's O2 and N2. So the stoichiometric air would have O2 and N2 in the ratio of 1:3.76 (since air is about 21% O2 and 79% N2, so 1 mole O2 comes with 3.76 moles N2).

   But in this problem, the actual air might be more or less than stoichiometric because there's excess O2 (3.1% in the products). So the combustion is in excess air.

6. **Calculating the stoichiometric air:**
   Wait, perhaps I should first calculate the actual air used, then find the stoichiometric air needed, and then compute the percentage as (actual/stoichiometric)*100.

   Alternatively, maybe I can use the dry air composition to find the air-fuel ratio.

   Let me try to approach this step by step.

   First, from the product composition, I can find the moles of O2 consumed, the moles of CO2 produced, etc.

7. **Mole Balance Approach:**
   Let's consider that all the C in the fuel ends up as CO2 and CO. Similarly, all the H ends up as H2O, but since H2O isn't in the dry products, I might need to find it through another way.

   Let me proceed with the dry products. So, in the dry products:

   - Moles of CO2 = 13
   - Moles of CO = 0.3
   - Moles of O2 = 3.1
   - Moles of N2 = 83.6

   Now, the total moles of dry products are 100.

   Let me think about the moles in the products that come from the air and the fuel.

   The N2 in the products comes from the air. So the moles of N2 in the products should equal the moles of N2 in the air supplied.

   So, moles of N2 in products = 83.6 = moles of N2 in air.

   Since air is 79% N2 by volume, so moles of N2 in air = 0.79 * moles of air.

   Wait, but the air isn't dry because of the humidity. So the air supplied has some H2O in it.

   Wait, but perhaps I can first calculate the moles of air (dry) from the N2.

   Because the N2 in the products comes from the air, and if the combustion doesn't consume N2, then the moles of N2 in the products equal the moles of N2 in the air.

   So, moles of N2 in air = moles of N2 in products = 83.6.

   Since air contains 79% N2 by volume, the total moles of air (dry) would be 83.6 / 0.79.

   Let me compute that: 83.6 / 0.79 ≈ 105.7 moles of dry air.

   But wait, the air supplied is not dry; it's at 48% relative humidity. So the actual air has more mass because of the water vapor.

   But I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me clarify.

   The air as supplied has a certain amount of water vapor due to humidity. So the total moles of air (wet) would be more than the dry moles because of the water.

   Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the actual moles of air supplied, considering the humidity.

   Let me think about the humidity first. At 25°C and 100 kPa, the saturation pressure of water can be found. Then, using relative humidity, the partial pressure of water vapor in the air can be determined.

   The saturation pressure of water at 25°C is about 3.169 kPa. So at 48% relative humidity, the partial pressure of H2O is 0.48 * 3.169 ≈ 1.521 kPa.

   The total pressure is 100 kPa, so the partial pressure of dry air (N2, O2, etc.) is 100 - 1.521 = 98.479 kPa.

   Now, the mole fraction of water vapor in the air is (1.521 / 100) ≈ 0.01521, and the mole fraction of dry air is 0.98479.

   So, if the total moles of air (wet) is n_air, then moles of dry air = n_air * 0.98479, and moles of H2O = n_air * 0.01521.

   But how does this tie into the combustion?

   Maybe I should first find the moles of dry air from the N2 in the products. As I thought before, moles of N2 in products = 83.6 = moles of N2 in dry air.

   Since N2 is 79% of dry air by mole, moles of dry air = 83.6 / 0.79 ≈ 105.7 moles.

   So dry air is 105.7 moles. Therefore, the total moles of wet air (n_air) can be found from dry air moles = n_air * (dry air mole fraction).

   Wait, dry air mole fraction is (98.479 / 100) ≈ 0.98479.

   So, 105.7 = n_air * 0.98479 → n_air ≈ 105.7 / 0.98479 ≈ 107.4 moles.

   So the total moles of air supplied (wet) is about 107.4. Of these, moles of H2O in the air is 107.4 * (1.521/100) ≈ 107.4 * 0.01521 ≈ 1.633 moles.

   I think that's correct.

8. **Now, back to the combustion products.**

   The dry products are 100 moles, but the H2O comes from both the fuel and the moisture in the air.

   Let me write the combustion reaction considering both the fuel and the air's moisture.

   The fuel is CxHy. The combustion equation would be:

   CxHy + (a) O2 + (b) N2 → x CO2 + (y/2) H2O + (other products) + (b) N2.

   Wait, but in the products, we have CO2, CO, O2, and N2. So the H2O is not in the dry products, which means it's been condensed or removed. So in the dry products, the H2O is gone, and only other gases remain.

   Hmm, that complicates things because the H2O from the fuel and the air's moisture is not accounted for in the dry products. So perhaps I need to include it in the overall mole balance.

   Alternatively, maybe I can approach this by considering the entire system, including the H2O from the fuel and the air.

   Let me try to model the combustion process.

   Let me denote:

   - 1 mole of fuel: CxHy
   - moles of O2 supplied: ?
   - moles of N2 supplied: 105.7 (from earlier calculation)
   - moles of H2O in air: 1.633 (from earlier)

   The combustion products are:

   - CO2: 13 moles
   - CO: 0.3 moles
   - O2: 3.1 moles
   - N2: 83.6 moles
   - H2O: ? (from fuel and air)

   But since the product analysis is dry, the H2O is not present, so perhaps it's condensed or otherwise removed. For the purpose of mole balances, I need to account for all the H2O produced.

   So the total moles of H2O produced would be from the fuel and the moisture in the air.

   Wait, the fuel's H would become H2O, and the moisture in the air contributes H2O as well.

   So let's write the mole balances.

   Carbon balance: moles of C in fuel = moles of CO2 + moles of CO.

   So 1*x = 13 + 0.3 → x = 13.3.

   So the fuel is C13.3Hy? Wait, but x has to be an integer, so maybe I'm missing something here. Alternatively, perhaps I can express it as fractions.

   Wait, maybe the fuel is considered as CxHy, and the moles of the fuel is not necessarily 1. Maybe I should assume the fuel is 'm' moles. Wait, perhaps it's better to take the fuel as 1 mole for simplicity.

   So, assuming 1 mole of CxHy.

   Then:

   Carbon: x = 13 + 0.3 → x=13.3 → C13.3H_y.

   Now, the Hydrogen comes from the fuel and goes into H2O.

   The moles of H2O produced from the fuel would be (y/2) moles.

   Additionally, the air contributes 1.633 moles of H2O.

   So the total H2O in the products is (y/2) + 1.633.

   But wait, in the dry products, we don't have H2O, so perhaps all of it is condensed. So in the dry products, H2O is absent, so the total moles of H2O is (y/2 +1.633), but they're not part of the dry analysis.

   Now, the O2 balance.

   The O2 consumed comes from the air and any O2 in the products.

   Let me write the O2 balance.

   Moles of O2 supplied = moles of O2 consumed + moles of O2 in products.

   Moles of O2 supplied: from the air, which is 21% of dry air. Since dry air is 105.7 moles, O2 is 0.21 * 105.7 ≈ 22.20 moles.

   Moles of O2 consumed: goes into CO2, CO, and H2O.

   Let me compute the moles of O2 consumed.

   Each mole of CO2 uses 2 moles O2, each mole of CO uses 1 mole O2, and each mole of H2O uses 0.5 moles O2.

   So total O2 consumed = (13 * 2) + (0.3 *1) + ((y/2 +1.633) * 0.5 )

   Let me compute each part:

   CO2: 13 *2 =26
   CO: 0.3 *1=0.3
   H2O: (y/2 +1.633) * 0.5 = (y/2)*0.5 + 1.633 *0.5 = y/4 +0.8165

   So total O2 consumed =26 +0.3 + y/4 +0.8165 =26.3 + y/4 +0.8165 → 27.1165 + y/4.

   Moles of O2 supplied =22.20.

   Moles of O2 in products =3.1.

   So according to O2 balance:

   O2 supplied = O2 consumed + O2 in products.

   22.20 = (27.1165 + y/4) +3.1 → 22.20 =30.2165 + y/4 → y/4= 22.20 -30.2165= -8.0165.

   Wait, that can't be right because y can't be negative. Hmm, did I make a mistake somewhere?

   Oops, I think I messed up the O2 balance equation. Let me re-express it correctly.

   The O2 supplied is equal to the O2 consumed in the combustion plus the O2 remaining in the products.

   So O2 supplied = O2 in CO2 + O2 in CO + O2 in H2O + O2 in products.

   Alternatively, the O2 used is for forming CO2, CO, and H2O, and the excess is in the products.

   So the moles of O2 used in products is:

   For CO2: each molecule uses 2 O2 → 13 *2 =26
   For CO: each uses 1 O2 → 0.3 *1=0.3
   For H2O: each uses 0.5 O2 → (y/2 +1.633)*0.5 = (y/4 +0.8165)

   So total O2 used =26 +0.3 + y/4 +0.8165 =26.3 + y/4 +0.8165=27.1165 + y/4.

   But the O2 supplied is 22.20 moles, and the O2 remaining is 3.1 moles.

   So the equation should be:

   O2 supplied = O2 used + O2 remaining.

   So 22.20 = (27.1165 + y/4) +3.1 → 22.20 =30.2165 + y/4 → y/4=22.20 -30.2165= -8.0165 → y= -32.066.

   That's impossible because y can't be negative. So something's wrong here. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the O2 supplied.

   Wait, the O2 supplied is part of the dry air. So the dry air is 105.7 moles, with 21% O2 → 0.21*105.7≈22.20 moles O2. That's correct.

   Hmm, but according to the O2 balance, this leads to a negative y, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

   Wait, maybe I should include the O2 in the products as part of the total O2.

   Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this differently. Maybe using the concept of excess air.

   Let me think: the total moles of O2 in the products
