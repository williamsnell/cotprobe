The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Sea divers are aware of a danger known as the "bends". Explain the physiological mechanism of the bends.

Options:

A: Carbon dioxide bubbles forming in the blood causing acidosis
B: Rapid increase in barometric pressure causing the bends
C: Formation of helium bubbles in the bloodstream due to rapid ascent
D: Increased salinity in the water leading to dehydration and joint pain
E: Oxygen bubbles forming in the blood leading to hypoxia
F: Lack of oxygen while breathing under high pressure leading to the bends
G: Accumulation of lactic acid in muscles due to strenuous activity underwater
H: Sudden decrease in water temperature causing muscle cramping and disorientation
I: Rise in blood pressure due to underwater currents, resulting in the bends
J: Bubbles of nitrogen gas form in the blood and other tissue fluids when the barometric pressure drops below the total pressure of all gases dissolved in the body fluids, causing dizziness, paralysis, and unconsciousness, known as the bends.

Okay, so I have this question about the bends in sea divers. I remember the bends are a condition that happens when divers surface too quickly. But wait, what exactly causes it?

I think it's something to do with gases in the body. When a diver is underwater, the pressure is higher, right? So gases dissolve in their bloodstream and tissues because of that pressure. But when they come up too fast, the pressure drops quickly. I guess that makes the gases come out of solution, forming bubbles.

Which gas is it though? I remember that nitrogen is a big part of the air we breathe, so maybe that's the main one. So when the pressure decreases, the nitrogen can't stay dissolved anymore and forms bubbles in the blood and tissues. That must be why it's called the bendsâ€”because the bubbles cause joint pain and other symptoms like dizziness or even paralysis.

Looking at the options, option J says that nitrogen bubbles form when barometric pressure drops below the total gas pressure in body fluids. That sounds exactly like what I was thinking. The other options don't seem right. Like option C talks about helium, but I don't think that's the main gas involved unless the diver is using a special mixture. But the bends are more commonly associated with nitrogen.

Option A is about carbon dioxide and acidosis, which doesn't fit. The bends are about gas bubbles, not CO2 levels. Option E mentions oxygen bubbles causing hypoxia, but oxygen isn't the gas that's the problem here. Plus, hypoxia is lack of oxygen, but the bends are about gas formation.

So yeah, the correct answer should be J.

The bends, a condition experienced by sea divers, occur when they ascend too quickly. Underwater, high pressure allows gases like nitrogen to dissolve in the bloodstream and tissues. Upon rapid ascent, the pressure drops, causing these gases to form bubbles. This process leads to symptoms such as joint pain, dizziness, and potentially severe complications. Among the options, only J accurately describes this mechanism involving nitrogen bubbles forming due to decreased barometric pressure.

Answer: J
