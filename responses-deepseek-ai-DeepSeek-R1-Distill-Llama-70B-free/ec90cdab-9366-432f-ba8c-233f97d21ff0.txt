Okay, so I need to figure out how long the school year would be with a 5% increase from the current 180 days. Hmm, let's see. I remember that percentage increases involve multiplying the original number by (1 + the percentage as a decimal). 

Wait, so 5% as a decimal is 0.05. So I should calculate 180 days plus 5% of 180. Or maybe I can just multiply 180 by 1.05. That sounds right because 1.05 is 100% +5%, which is the total after the increase.

Let me do the math. 180 times 1.05. Hmm, 180 times 1 is easy, that's 180. Then 180 times 0.05 is... wait, 0.05 is the same as 5%, so 5% of 180. To find 5% of 180, I can divide 180 by 20 because 5% is 1/20th. So 180 divided by 20 is 9. Oh okay, so 5% of 180 is 9. 

So adding that to the original 180 days gives 180 + 9 = 189 days. Wait, but let me double-check that multiplication to be sure. Maybe I should do it the long way. 180 * 1.05. Let's break it down: 180 * 1 = 180, and 180 * 0.05 is 9. So 180 + 9 equals 189. Yep, that's correct.

Looking at the options, option G is 189 days. So the answer should be G.

The school year would be 189 days after a 5% increase from 180 days.
