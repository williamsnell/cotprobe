Okay, let's see. I have this problem about heat transfer and condensation. Hmm. So, the question is about a cylinder used for condensing steam. The cylinder has an outer diameter of 1 inch and is 6 feet long. The wall temperature is 140°F. The steam is at 7 psia. I need to find the unit-surface conductances in both horizontal and vertical positions. The options are given as A to J.

Wait, unit-surface conductance is probably the U-factor, right? Or wait, no, surface conductance... Maybe it's referring to the heat transfer coefficient? Oh, right, the unit surface conductance is the heat transfer coefficient, which is usually denoted as h. But wait, sometimes people call it U the overall heat transfer coefficient, but U is for the combined resistance, including both sides. Here, since it's the surface conductance, maybe it's just the individual h values for each position.

So, the cylinder is either horizontal or vertical. I think the orientation affects the condensation process. I remember that for film condensation, the heat transfer coefficient depends on whether the surface is vertical or horizontal. Oh right, because the condensate drips down differently, changing the film thickness and thus the heat transfer.

The formula for the heat transfer coefficient in film condensation varies with orientation. For a vertical surface, the formula is h = (4 * k^3 * ρ^2 * g * (T_sat - T_wall)) / (μ * (μ^2 * (ρ - ρ_vapor) * g)^{-1/3} * D)) ) Wait, maybe I should think of the standard correlations.

Wait, the standard formula for vertical surfaces is h = (0.943) * ((k^3 * ρ^2 * g (T_sat - T_w)) / (μ * D))^(1/4). Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Or is it for horizontal cylinders? Let me think.

Alternatively, the Nusselt theory for film condensation gives h as a function of the geometry. For a vertical plate, it's h = ( (4 * k * ρ^2 * g (T_sat - T_w) ) / ( μ * (μ/(ρ)) * ( (ρ - ρ_vapor) g D)^{-1/3} )) )) Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the Nusselt number for a vertical plate is Nu = (h L)/(k) = (4/(3) * (Re)^{1/3}) ) where Re is the Reynolds number. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, I remember that for vertical surfaces, the heat transfer coefficient is given by h = ( (k^3 * ρ^2 * g (T_sat - T_w) ) / ( μ * D )) )^{1/4} * some constant.

Wait, maybe better to look up the exact formula. Oh wait, I can't. So I have to think. Okay, I think for a vertical plate, the formula is h = 0.943 [ (k³ ρ² g (T_sat - T_w)) / (μ D) ]^(1/4). And for a horizontal cylinder, it's h = 0.725 [ (k³ ρ² g (T_sat - T_w) * D ) / (μ) ]^(1/4). Or wait, maybe the formula for horizontal is h = 0.725 [ (k³ ρ (ρ - ρ_v) g (T_sat - T_w) D ) / μ ]^(1/4). Hmm.

Wait, but the cylinder is 1 inch in outer diameter. So D is 1 inch, which I need to convert into feet because the units in the options are in ft². So 1 inch is 1/12 ft.

First, I need to find the saturation temperature for steam at 7 psia. Because the steam is condensing at that pressure. I remember that at 7 psia, the saturation temperature is about 146.3°F. Wait, but wait, let me think: at 1 atm (14.7 psia), boiling point is 212°F, so lower pressure would have lower T_sat. So 7 psia, what is the T_sat? Let me try to recall: maybe around 146°F. Let me double-check in my mind. Yes, 7 psia is about 146.3°F. So T_sat is 146.3°F, and the wall temperature is 140°F. So T_sat - T_wall is 6.3°F.

Wait, but in heat transfer, we usually use absolute temperatures. Oh, but since it's a temperature difference, it's okay to use °F, as it's a delta.

Now, I need the properties of the condensate (saturated liquid) at 7 psia. So I need to find: thermal conductivity k, density ρ, viscosity μ, and maybe surface tension, but I think in the formula it's not used.

Let me think about the properties. At 7 psia, the saturation temperature is about 146.3°F. So the saturated liquid (water) properties at this state are approximately:

- ρ (density) ≈ 52.4 lbm/ft³? Wait, no, at higher temps, water density decreases. Let's see, at 100°F, it's about 53.3 lbm/ft³. At 200°F, about 47.8. So 146.3°F is between 100 and 200, so maybe around 50 lbm/ft³? Alternatively, perhaps I should remember exact values. Wait, I think at 7 psia (which is just a bit below atmospheric), the density of the liquid is about 52 lbm/ft³. Let me confirm: yes, around 52 lbm/ft³.

Viscosity μ: for water at around 140°F, viscosity is about 0.3 centiPoise. Wait, 1 centiPoise = 0.000672 lbm/(ft·h). So 0.3 cP is 0.3 * 0.000672 = 0.0002016 lbm/(ft·h).

Thermal conductivity k: for water around 140°F, it's about 0.38 BTU·in/(hr·ft²·°F). Wait, but wait, the units. Because in the formula, we're using feet, so let me convert it properly. 1 BTU·in/(hr·ft²·°F) is equal to 0.14422789 BTU/(hr·ft·°F) because 1 inch is 1/12 ft. So 0.38 * 0.144227 ≈ 0.0548 BTU/(hr·ft·°F). Wait, no, wait: 1 BTU·in/(hr·ft²·°F) = (1/12) BTU/(hr·ft·°F). So 0.38 * (1/12) ≈ 0.03167 BTU/(hr·ft·°F).

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Thermal conductivity k is in BTU/(hr·ft·°F). So 1 W/m·K is approximately 0.57782 BTU/(hr·ft·°F). But for water, at 140°F, k is around 0.38 W/m·K. So 0.38 * 0.57782 ≈ 0.2192 BTU/(hr·ft·°F). Wait, I'm getting confused between W/m·K and BTU/(hr·ft·°F). Let me clarify.

Alternatively, I can use the following approach:

Given that for water at 100°C (which is 212°F), the thermal conductivity is about 0.379 W/m·K. Since 140°F is 60°C, which is similar to 100°F (38°C), but wait, 140°F is 60°C. So at 60°C, thermal conductivity of water is around 0.650 W/m·K. Wait, no: wait, no, I'm getting mixed up. Let me think.

Wait, no, wait, no: at higher temperatures, the thermal conductivity of water decreases. Because at 20°C, it's about 0.598 W/m·K, and at 100°C, it's 0.379. So at 60°C, it's somewhere in between. Let's say approximately 0.45 W/m·K.

Wait, but I think I'm overcomplicating. Maybe it's better to use the exact values. Let's list out the properties:

At 7 psia, saturation temp Tsat = 146.3°F.

Properties of saturated liquid water at 7 psia:

- Density (ρ) ≈ 52.4 lbm/ft³
- Viscosity (μ) ≈ 0.3 cP = 0.3 * 0.000672 lbm/(ft·h) = 0.0002016 lbm/(ft·h)
- Thermal conductivity (k) ≈ 0.38 W/m·K. Wait, no, wait: wait, in BTU units.

Wait, maybe I should look for properties in consistent units. Let me try to find the values in English units.

Alternatively, I can use an online source but since I can't, I'll proceed with approximate values.

So, let's proceed.

So, for a vertical cylinder (or vertical surface), the heat transfer coefficient h_vertical is given by:

h_vertical = 0.943 * [ (k^3 * ρ^2 * g * (Tsat - Tw)) / (μ * D) ]^(1/4)

Wait, for a vertical plate, yes, but for a vertical cylinder, does the formula change? Hmm. Alternatively, for a vertical cylinder, the formula is similar to a vertical plate because the length is much larger than the diameter.

Wait, but the cylinder is 6 ft long. The diameter is 1 inch, so 0.0833 ft. So length is 72 times the diameter. So it's a long cylinder, so the formula for a vertical plate should be applicable, treating the cylinder as a vertical surface.

Similarly, for a horizontal cylinder, the formula is:

h_horizontal = 0.725 * [ (k^3 * ρ^2 * g * (Tsat - Tw) * D ) / μ ]^(1/4)

Wait, I think that's correct.

So, let me compute each term.

First, compute the temperature difference: Tsat - Tw = 146.3°F - 140°F = 6.3°F.

But wait, in calculations, we might better convert these to absolute temperatures if necessary, but since it's a difference, it's the same in °F and °R. Because 6.3°F difference is 6.3 °R. So perhaps no need to convert.

Now, let's compute the terms for the vertical case.

Compute each variable:

k is thermal conductivity in BTU/(hr·ft·°F). Let me get the exact value. I think at 140°F (60°C), k is approximately 0.38 W/m·K. Let's convert that to BTU/(hr·ft·°F).

1 W/m·K = 0.57782 BTU/(hr·ft·°F). So 0.38 W/m·K * 0.57782 ≈ 0.2196 BTU/(hr·ft·°F).

Alternatively, I remember that the thermal conductivity of water at 100°C is about 0.379 W/m·K, which would be about 0.379 * 0.57782 ≈ 0.219 BTU/(hr·ft·°F). So at 140°F (60°C), it's a bit higher than that, maybe 0.225? Let's take k = 0.225 BTU/(hr·ft·°F).

ρ = 52.4 lbm/ft³.

μ = 0.3 cP = 0.3 * 0.000672 lbm/(ft·h) = 0.0002016 lbm/(ft·h).

g is 32.174 ft/s². But in these formulas, g is in ft/s², but I need to make sure the units are consistent.

D = 1 inch = 1/12 ft ≈ 0.08333 ft.

So for vertical:

h_vertical = 0.943 * [ (k^3 * ρ^2 * g * (Tsat - Tw)) / (μ * D) ]^(1/4)

Let's compute the numerator inside the brackets first.

k^3 = (0.225)^3 ≈ 0.0114 (BTU^3)/(hr^3·ft^3·°F^3)

ρ^2 = (52.4)^2 ≈ 2745 lbm²/ft^6

g = 32.174 ft/s²

(Tsat - Tw) = 6.3 °F = 6.3 °R (since it's a difference)

So numerator: 0.0114 * 2745 * 32.174 * 6.3.

Let me compute step by step.

0.0114 * 2745 ≈ 31.29

31.29 * 32.174 ≈ Let's compute 31 *32 = 992, 0.29*32≈9.28, total ≈ 1001.28.

1001.28 *6.3 ≈ 6308.

Denominator: μ * D = 0.0002016 lbm/(ft·h) * 0.08333 ft ≈ 0.0000168 lbm/(h)

So the term inside the brackets is 6308 / 0.0000168.

Wait, 6308 divided by 0.0000168.

Let me compute 6308 / 0.0000168.

6308 / 1.68e-5 = 6308 * (1 / 1.68e-5) )

1/1.68e-5 ≈ 59523.8

So 6308 * 59523.8 ≈ ?

Wait, 6300 * 59524 ≈ 6300 *6e4 = 3.78e8, but more accurately:

6308 * 59523.8 → Let's approximate it as 6.3e3 * 5.95e4 = 6.3*5.95= ~37.485 → 37.485e7 = 3.7485e8.

So the term inside is approximately 3.7485e8.

Now take the fourth root: (3.7485e8)^(1/4).

Hmm. Let's compute the logarithm.

ln(3.7485e8) ≈ ln(3.7485) + ln(1e8) → ≈ 1.32 + 18.42 = 19.74.

Divide by 4: 19.74 /4 ≈4.935.

Exponentiate: e^4.935 ≈ around 138 (since e^4 is 54.6, e^5≈148.4, so 4.935 is close to 5. Maybe around 140? Let me compute 4.935.

e^4.935 = e^(5 - 0.065) = e^5 * e^(-0.065) ≈ 148.413 * 0.9375 ≈ 139.1.

So (3.7485e8)^(1/4) ≈ 139.1.

Then multiply by 0.943: 0.943 * 139.1 ≈ 131.2 BTU/(hr·ft²·°F).

Wait, but wait, let me check the units. Because all the units in the terms should result in h having units BTU/(hr·ft²·°F). Let me make sure the calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Because the vertical case calculation is giving me around 131 h, but the options are all higher, like 1600 and so on. So perhaps I messed up the units somewhere.

Wait, wait, wait, wait. Oh no! Because I think I forgot that the formula might require the properties to be in different units. Because in the denominator, we have μ in lbm/(ft·h), but the numerator has terms in lbm²/(ft^6) etc. So perhaps the units don't cancel properly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that in the formula, the units for h are BTU/(hr·ft²·°F), so perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to compute each term in SI units and then convert h to English units. Let me try that.

Wait, but let me think again about the formula. The Nusselt number for vertical surface is:

Nu = (h D)/(k) = 0.943 [ ( (ρ^2 g (Tsat - Tw) D^3 ) / ( μ^2 ) ) * ( ( μ (ρ - ρ_vapor) g D^3 )^{-1} ) ]^(1/4) ?

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula correctly. The correct formula for vertical surface is:

h = 0.943 * [ (k³ ρ² g (T_sat - T_w) ) / ( μ D ) ]^(1/4 )

Wait, I think that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should recheck the exponents. Let me compute the units.

In the term inside the brackets:

k has units W/(m·K) → BTU/(hr·ft·°F).

ρ is kg/m³ → lbm/ft³.

g is m/s² → ft/s².

(Tsat - Tw) is °C or °F, which as a difference is same as K or °R.

μ has units Pa·s → lbm/(ft·h).

D is in meters → feet.

So let me write the units for each term.

[k]^3 → (BTU/(hr·ft·°F))^3.

[ρ]^2 → (lbm/ft³)^2.

[g] → ft/s².

[ (Tsat - Tw) ] → °F (or K, but as a difference, same as °R).

Denominator: [μ] → lbm/(ft·h), [D] → ft.

So putting it all together:

(k^3) * (ρ^2) * (g) * (ΔT) / (μ * D )

Units:

( (BTU/(hr·ft·°F))^3 ) * ( (lbm/ft³)^2 ) * (ft/s²) * (°F) ) / ( (lbm/(ft·h)) * ft )

Simplify numerator:

BTU^3/(hr^3·ft^3·°F^3) ) * lbm^2/(ft^6) ) * ft/(s²
