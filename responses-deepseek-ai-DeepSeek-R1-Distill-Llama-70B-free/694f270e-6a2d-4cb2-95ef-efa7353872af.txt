Question:

Ms. Ling has been living in her home for exactly 4 years. She knows that there are 12 months in each year. She found the total number of months, m, she has been living in her home by using the number sentence below. 4 × 12 = m Which number sentence shows another way to find the total number of months, m, Ms. Ling has been living in her home?

Options:

A: 12 ÷ m = 4
B: m ÷ 4 = 12
C: m × 4 = 12
D: 12 × m = 4
E: m - 12 = 4
F: 4 × m = 12
G: 4 + m = 12
H: 12 – m = 4
I: m - 4 = 12

Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's asking.

Ms. Ling has been living in her home for exactly 4 years. She knows there are 12 months in each year. She found the total number of months, m, by using the equation 4 × 12 = m. Now, the question is asking which other number sentence can be used to find the same total number of months, m. The options are from A to I.

Hmm, so the original equation is 4 multiplied by 12 equals m. So m is 48 because 4 times 12 is 48. Now, I need to find another way to express this same calculation. Let me think about the operations involved.

Multiplication and division are inverses of each other. So if 4 × 12 = m, then maybe using division could give me another way. But how? Let me look at the options.

Option A: 12 ÷ m = 4. If I divide 12 by m and get 4, then m would be 3, which doesn't make sense because 4 years is 48 months. So that's not right.

Option B: m ÷ 4 = 12. Oh, wait, if m divided by 4 equals 12, then m must be 48 because 48 divided by 4 is 12. That makes sense because 4 years times 12 months per year is 48. So this seems like a valid equation.

Option C: m × 4 = 12. If I multiply m by 4 to get 12, m would be 3, which is wrong. So no.

Option D: 12 × m =4. That would mean m is 4/12, which is 1/3, definitely not the right answer.

Option E: m - 12 =4. Subtracting 12 from m gives 4, so m would be 16. But 4 years is 48 months, so that's not it.

Option F: 4 × m =12. So m would be 3, which is wrong.

Option G:4 + m =12. m would be 8, which isn't right either.

Option H: 12 – m =4. Solving for m gives m=8. Again, not correct.

Option I: m –4=12. So m would be 16. No, that's not right.

So looking through all the options, option B seems correct because m divided by 4 equals 12, which when solved gives m=48, the same as the original calculation.

The correct answer is option B, as it provides an alternative way to find m by dividing 48 by 4 to get 12.
