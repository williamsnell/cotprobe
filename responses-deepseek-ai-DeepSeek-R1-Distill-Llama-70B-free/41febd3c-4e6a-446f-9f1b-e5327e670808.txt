Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about utilitarianism and what Brandt's version says about rightness. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me start by recalling what I know about utilitarianism in general.

Utilitarianism is a theory in ethics that suggests the rightness or wrongness of an action is determined by its consequences, particularly the amount of happiness or utility it produces. The main idea is the greatest happiness for the greatest number. So, right actions are those that maximize overall happiness, and wrong ones minimize it.

Now, the question is specifically about the version defended by Brandt. I'm not too familiar with Brandt's specific take, but I think he might have a particular approach to utilitarianism. Wait, I remember that Brandt was a proponent of a more rule-based utilitarianism, but I'm not entirely sure. Or was it something else?

Wait, no. I think Brandt's utilitarianism might focus on the actual consequences of individual acts rather than rules. Let me think. Traditional utilitarianism, like Bentham's, is act utilitarian, which looks at each action's consequences. Then there's rule utilitarianism, like Mill perhaps, which focuses on whether the action conforms to a rule that, if followed, would maximize utility.

But I'm trying to remember Brandt's view. Oh right, Brandt proposed a version called "ideal utilitarianism," but wait, no, that's another philosopher. Maybe it's the other way around. Alternatively, I think Brandt's theory is more about the consequences of particular acts. So, he's an act utilitarian, meaning each action is judged on its own consequences.

Looking at the options, let's go through them.

Option A: the amount of harm caused by an action. That seems more like a harm principle, maybe related to negative utilitarianism, but not sure if that's what Brandt focuses on.

Option B: whether one's maxim can be universalized. That's Kant's categorical imperative, so not related to Brandt's utilitarianism.

Option C: the moral character of the person. That's virtue ethics, not utilitarianism.

Option D: distribution of wealth. That's more about justice or economic systems, not directly about rightness in utilitarian terms.

Option E: the consequences of particular acts. This sounds like act utilitarianism, which would align with Brandt if he's an act utilitarian.

Option F: intentions behind the action. Utilitarianism is more about outcomes than intentions, so probably not.

Option G: ideal rules. That's rule utilitarianism, which considers rules that would maximize utility if universally followed.

Option H: preferences of the individual. Maybe preference utilitarianism, which considers the satisfaction of preferences, but I'm not certain if that's Brandt.

Option I: total happiness in society. That's classic utilitarianism, but the question is about Brandt's version.

Option J: actual and recognized rules of society. That seems more like a social contract or cultural relativism approach.

So, if Brandt is an act utilitarian, then the rightness would be based on the consequences of particular acts, which is option E. But wait, I'm a bit confused because I think Brandt might have a different approach. Another thought: Brandt's version might be about the actual and recognized rules. No, I think that's more like Hare or someone else.

Wait, another angle. I remember that Brandt talked about "rule utilitarianism" but with a twist. Or perhaps his version is about the moral rules that would be accepted by rational people. Wait, but the question asks about what rightness is a function of. So, in rule utilitarianism, rightness is about whether the action conforms to a justified rule, which in turn is based on the consequences of having that rule.

But I thought Brandt's view was more about the consequences of individual actions. So, I'm leaning towards E: the consequences of particular acts.

Alternatively, if the question refers to "ideal rules," then G would be the answer. But I'm not certain.

Wait, let me try to remember. Brandt's "Theory of the Good and the Right" (I think that's the title) presents a form of rule utilitarianism. But wait, no, I think he actually proposed a form of utilitarianism that focuses on the consequences of individual actions, making him an act utilitarian. Or perhaps he combined elements.

Alternatively, I've heard that Brandt's version is called "multiplicative utilitarianism," but I'm not sure how that works. Alternatively, perhaps he focuses on the actual and recognized rules of society, but that doesn't fit with traditional utilitarianism.

Wait, another thought: I think Brandt's version is a form of rule utilitarianism where rightness is determined by whether the action is in accordance with the set of rules that would be best. So, if that's the case, then perhaps the answer is G: ideal rules.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. I think I need to clarify.

Utilitarianism can be divided into act and rule. Act looks at each act's consequences. Rule looks at whether the act conforms to a rule that, if followed, would produce the best outcomes.

If Brandt is a rule utilitarian, then the rightness is a function of whether the action follows such a rule. So, the rightness is determined by the rule, not the individual act's consequences.

But I'm not entirely sure if Brandt is a rule utilitarian. Alternatively, I think he might propose a form of rule utilitarianism where the rules are those that rational people would agree to under certain conditions.

Wait, I think Brandt's theory is called "rule utilitarianism," but perhaps his specific formulation is about the rules that would be accepted by rational individuals, which would be ideal rules.

In that case, the rightness would depend on the ideal rules, making option G the correct answer. But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, if Brandt is an act utilitarian, then it's option E.

I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think of another approach. The question says Brandt's version makes rightness a function of... So, what is the function? If it's consequences of particular acts (E), that's act utilitarian. If it's the rules (G), then rule utilitarian.

I think I remember that Brandt's version is a form of rule utilitarianism, perhaps called "ideal rule utilitarianism." Therefore, rightness is determined by whether the action conforms to an ideal rule, which is part of the optimal set of rules.

So, the answer would be G: ideal rules.

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up Brandt with another philosopher like Hare, who I think does discuss ideal rules.

Wait, another angle: the question gives the options, and one of them is about consequences of particular acts (E), and another about ideal rules (G). I need to select between these.

If Brandt's version is act utilitarian, E is correct. If rule, then G.

I think I recall that Brandt actually was a proponent of rule utilitarianism, so the answer would be G.

But I'm not 100% sure, so perhaps I should cross-check.

Wait, another thought: I think Brandt's theory is called "rule utilitarianism," and he argues that an action is right if it conforms to a set of rules whose acceptance would create more utility than other possible sets of rules.

So, rightness is a function of the rules, making the answer G: ideal rules.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, if the question says "the consequences of particular acts," that's act utilitarianism, which is more about each action's own consequences.

I think I'm going to have to make a decision here. I'll go with option E: the consequences of particular acts, because I think that's more in line with act utilitarianism, which Brandt might have defended.

Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again. Maybe Brandt's view is that rightness is determined by the consequences of individual actions, making it act utilitarian, so the answer is E.

Alternatively, if it's about rules, G is correct. I'm not entirely sure, but I think the more likely answer is E.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the options again. Option E is "the consequences of particular acts," which fits act utilitarianism. Option G is "ideal rules," which is rule utilitarian.

I think Brandt's version is a form of rule utilitarianism, so the answer would be G.

Wait, no, I think I've confused Brandt with someone else. Let me try to recall: Brandt's 1979 book "A Theory of the Good and the Right" presents a form of rule utilitarianism, but he calls it "ideal rule utilitarianism," where the moral rules are those that would be accepted by rational individuals under certain conditions.

So, in that case, rightness is a function of ideal rules. Therefore, the correct answer is G.

Yes, I think that's right. So, I'll go with option G.

The question asks about the version of utilitarianism defended by Brandt and what rightness is a function of. Utilitarianism generally determines the rightness or wrongness of an action based on its consequences, particularly the happiness or utility it produces. The question specifies Brandt's version, and the options include act utilitarianism (focusing on the consequences of particular acts) and rule utilitarianism (focusing on whether actions conform to rules that maximize utility).

Brandt's theory, as outlined in his 1979 book *A Theory of the Good and the Right*, is a form of rule utilitarianism. He argues that an action is right if it conforms to a set of ideal rules that rational individuals would accept under certain conditions. These rules are considered "ideal" because they are the ones that would maximize overall utility if universally followed. Therefore, rightness in Brandt's version is determined by adherence to these ideal rules, rather than the consequences of individual actions.

Given this analysis, the correct answer is **G: ideal rules**.

Answer: G
