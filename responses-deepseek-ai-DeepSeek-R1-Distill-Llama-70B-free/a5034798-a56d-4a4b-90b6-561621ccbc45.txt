Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about nonprofit sector practitioners conducting audience research. The question is asking what proportion of them do this. The options are from A to I, with various percentages.

Hmm, I remember that in the nonprofit sector, audience research isn't always a top priority. Nonprofits often focus more on their mission and services rather than market research. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact figures.

Wait, I think I've heard somewhere that a significant portion of nonprofits don't conduct much audience research. Maybe it's because they lack resources or don't see the immediate benefit. So perhaps the number is lower than I might expect.

Looking at the options, let's see: A is one-half, which is 50%. B is less than 10%, which is quite low. C says nearly all, which seems unlikely. D is more than 80%, that also seems high. E is 90%, which is even higher. F is three quarters, so 75%, G is one-quarter (25%), H is one-third (about 33%), and I is two-thirds (66%).

I think in the past, maybe around a third or so of nonprofits engaged in audience research. Or was it lower? I'm a bit confused now. Another thoughtâ€”nonprofits sometimes rely on anecdotal evidence or donor feedback rather than formal research. So maybe the number isn't that high.

Wait, I recall a study or report mentioning that only a small percentage, like around 10%, actually conduct regular audience research. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe it's around a quarter or a third. 

If I have to choose between the options, and considering that many nonprofits are small and resource-constrained, it's plausible that less than 10% conduct audience research. That would make option B the answer. But I'm not entirely certain because sometimes larger nonprofits might have the capacity, which could skew the numbers a bit higher.

Alternatively, maybe it's around one-third. So option H. But I'm not sure. I think the correct answer is B: Less than 10%, but I'm a bit doubtful. Another angle: the question says "approximately," so it's looking for a rough estimate. If I remember correctly, it's actually about a third of nonprofits that do audience research. So maybe H is the right choice.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Some sources say that a significant number don't do it. For example, maybe two-thirds don't, so one-third do. So the answer would be H: One third.

But then again, I thought it was lower. Maybe I should think about which option makes more sense. If it's less than 10%, that's a very small number. But perhaps it's more than that. Maybe around a quarter or a third.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. I'll go with option B: Less than 10%, because I have a faint memory of that figure being cited in some nonprofit management literature.

The correct answer is based on the understanding that a small proportion of nonprofit sector practitioners conduct audience research, likely due to resource constraints and priorities focused elsewhere. While there might be some uncertainty, the reasoning leans towards a lower percentage. 

Answer: B
