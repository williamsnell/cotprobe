Okay, let's see. I have this question about depreciation. Hmm, I remember that straight-line depreciation is a method where the cost of an asset is spread out evenly over its useful life. So the farmer buys a tractor for $40,000 and expects to use it for 20 years. After that, the tractor will have a salvage value of $10,000. I need to find the depreciation for the first year.

Wait, depreciation is calculated by taking the cost minus the salvage value, right? So the cost here is $40,000, and the salvage is $10,000. Subtracting those gives me $30,000. That's the total amount that will be depreciated over the 20 years.

So straight-line method means each year's depreciation is the same. I think the formula is (Cost - Salvage) / Useful Life. So that's 30,000 divided by 20. Let me do that math: 30,000 divided by 20 equals 1,500. So the depreciation each year is $1,500.

Wait, but let me double-check. The question asks for the first year's depreciation. Since it's straight-line, each year is the same, so the first year is also $1,500. Looking at the options, option A is 1500. That should be the correct answer.

I don't think I made any mistakes. The key is subtracting the salvage value first before dividing by the years. If I had forgotten to subtract the salvage, I would have gotten a higher number, like 40k/20=2k, which is option C. But that's not right because salvage value is the amount the asset is worth at the end, so it's not depreciated. So yeah, 1500 is correct. The answer should be A.

The straight-line depreciation for the first year is calculated by subtracting the salvage value from the cost and dividing by the useful life. 

\[
\text{Depreciation} = \frac{\text{Cost} - \text{Salvage Value}}{\text{Useful Life}} = \frac{40,000 - 10,000}{20} = \frac{30,000}{20} = 1,500
\]

Thus, the correct answer is **A: 1500**.
