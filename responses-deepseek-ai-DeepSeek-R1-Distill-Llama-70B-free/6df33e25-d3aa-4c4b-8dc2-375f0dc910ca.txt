Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about factors that account for individual differences in problem solving. Hmm, let's break it down. The question is asking what factors cause people to vary in how they solve problems. I remember from my psychology classes that problem-solving abilities can be influenced by several things.

First, I think about motivation. If someone is really motivated, they might tackle problems more effectively. Then there's personality—like, some people might be more persistent or have traits that help them approach problems differently. Intelligence also comes to mind because higher cognitive abilities probably make problem-solving easier. 

Background knowledge must play a role too. If you know more about a subject, you're better equipped to solve related problems. Memory is another factor because being able to recall information can help in finding solutions. Oh, and the application of knowledge, meaning how well someone can use what they know in real situations, that's important too.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one includes all these elements. Option H says "Motivation and personality, intelligence, background knowledge, memory, and application of knowledge." That sounds exactly like what I was thinking. 

Let me quickly check the other options to make sure. Option A is age and gender, but I don't think those are the main factors. B is birth order and marital status, which don't directly relate. C is sleep and diet, which affect overall health but maybe not specifically problem-solving differences. D is astrology and time of day—those seem more like external factors and not direct personal traits. E is about screen time, which might affect habits but not necessarily problem-solving ability. F is physical strength, which is unrelated. G is language proficiency, which could help in some cases but isn't a comprehensive answer. I is height and weight, which don't relate. J is handwriting and art, which are specific skills but not the broad factors we're looking for.

So, yeah, I'm confident that option H is the correct answer because it covers the main psychological factors that influence problem-solving individual differences.

The factors that account for individual differences in problem solving include motivation, personality, intelligence, background knowledge, memory, and the application of knowledge. These elements collectively influence how individuals approach and solve problems, making option H the most comprehensive and accurate choice.
