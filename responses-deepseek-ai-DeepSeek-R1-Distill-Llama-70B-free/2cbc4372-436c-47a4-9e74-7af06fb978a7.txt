Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the question says that a force of 0.20 newtons acts on a mass of 100 grams. I need to find the acceleration. Hmm, right, I remember from class that there's a formula involving force, mass, and acceleration. Oh wait, Newton's second law! Yeah, the formula is F equals m times a. So F = ma.

Wait, but wait, F is the force, m is mass, and a is acceleration. So to find acceleration, I need to rearrange the formula. Oh right, a equals F divided by m. So a = F/m.

But wait, the units here might be tricky. The force is given in newtons, and the mass is in grams. Oh right, I should convert grams to kilograms because the standard unit for mass in physics is kilograms. So 100 grams is 0.1 kilograms because 1 kilogram is 1000 grams. Dividing 100 by 1000 gives 0.1 kg.

Alright, so plugging the numbers into the formula: F is 0.20 N, m is 0.1 kg. So a = 0.20 / 0.1. Let me do that calculation. 0.2 divided by 0.1 is 2. So the acceleration would be 2 m/s².

Wait, but let me double-check my units to make sure I didn't mess up. Force in newtons is correct because F = ma, and newtons are kg·m/s². So when I divide N by kg, the kg cancels out, leaving m/s². Yep, that makes sense.

So looking at the options, option C is 2.0 m/s². So that must be the correct answer.

To solve the problem, we use Newton's second law, which states that force equals mass multiplied by acceleration:  

\[
F = ma
\]

Rearranging the formula to solve for acceleration gives:  

\[
a = \frac{F}{m}
\]

The given force is \( F = 0.20 \, \text{N} \), and the mass is \( m = 100 \, \text{g} \). Since the standard unit for mass in physics is kilograms, we convert \( 100 \, \text{g} \) to kilograms:  

\[
m = 0.1 \, \text{kg}
\]

Substituting the values into the formula:  

\[
a = \frac{0.20}{0.1} = 2.0 \, \text{m/s}^2
\]

Thus, the acceleration is \( 2.0 \, \text{m/s}^2 \). Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C: 2.0 m/sec²**
