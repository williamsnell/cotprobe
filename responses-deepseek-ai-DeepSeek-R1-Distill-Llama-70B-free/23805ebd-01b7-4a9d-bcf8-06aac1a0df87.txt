Okay, so Mrs. Ash wants to set up a savings account for her daughter's education. She needs to figure out how much she should deposit annually for 17 years at a 5% interest rate to end up with $20,000. Hmm, I remember this has something to do with compound interest, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, I think it's an annuity problem. Annuities involve regular payments to accumulate a future sum. Oh right, the formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity is FV = PMT * [(1 + r)^n - 1] / r. So FV is what she wants, which is $20,000. PMT is the annual deposit we're trying to find. r is the annual interest rate, 5%, so that's 0.05. n is the number of periods, which is 17 years.

Let me plug in the numbers. So FV is 20,000, r is 0.05, n is 17. The formula rearranged to solve for PMT would be PMT = FV / [(1 + r)^n - 1) / r].

Wait, calculating the denominator first. Let's compute (1 + 0.05)^17. 1.05 to the power of 17. Hmm, I don't have a calculator here, but I can approximate it. Alternatively, maybe I can remember that 1.05^17 is about 2.317. Let me check that. So 1.05^10 is about 1.6289, then 1.05^7 is approximately 1.4071. Multiplying those gives roughly 2.317. So (1.05)^17 ≈ 2.317.

So the denominator becomes (2.317 - 1) / 0.05. That's 1.317 / 0.05, which is about 26.34.

So PMT = 20,000 / 26.34. Let's calculate that. 20,000 divided by 26.34. Let me see... 20,000 / 26.34. 26.34 * 750 is 19,755. Because 26 * 750 is 19,500, and 0.34*750 is 255, so total 19,755. That's pretty close to 20,000. So 750 would give about 19,755, which is a bit less than 20,000. So maybe the PMT is a bit higher than 750.

Wait, let me do more precise calculation. 26.34 * 758 = ? Let's see, 26 * 758 = 19,708. 0.34 *758 is about 257.72. So total is 19,708 + 257.72 = 19,965.72. Still a little short of 20,000. Maybe 758. Let's try 760. 26.34 *760. 26*760=19,760. 0.34*760=258.4. So total 19,760 +258.4=20,018.4. Oh, that's just over 20,000. So the PMT needed is around 760. But wait, the options don't have 760. Let me check the options again.

Looking back, the options are A:600, B:773.98, C:800, D:850, E:925, F:700, G:650, H:500, I:750, J:900.

Hmm, I got approximately 759, but the closest option I have is B:773.98 or I:750. Wait, maybe my approximation of (1.05)^17 was off. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps I should compute (1.05)^17 more accurately.

Let me compute it step by step. 

1.05^1 = 1.05
^2 = 1.1025
^3 ≈1.1576
^4≈1.2155
^5≈1.2763
^6≈1.3401
^7≈1.4071
^8≈1.4775
^9≈1.5513
^10≈1.6289
^11≈1.7103
^12≈1.7959
^13≈1.8856
^14≈1.9799
^15≈2.0789
^16≈2.1829
^17≈2.2920

Wait, so 1.05^17 is approximately 2.2920, not 2.317 as I thought earlier. So that changes the calculation.

So the denominator is (2.2920 -1)/0.05 = (1.292)/0.05 = 25.84.

So PMT = 20,000 /25.84 ≈ ?

20,000 /25.84. Let's compute that. 25.84 * 773 = let's see, 25 *773=19,325, 0.84*773=approx 649. So total 19,325+649=19,974. That's close to 20,000. So PMT is about 773. 

Looking at the options, option B is $773.98. That must be the correct answer.

To determine how much Mrs. Ash needs to deposit annually for 17 years at a 5% interest rate to accumulate $20,000, we use the formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity:

\[
FV = PMT \cdot \frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r}
\]

Where:
- \( FV = \$20,000 \) (the desired future value),
- \( r = 0.05 \) (the annual interest rate),
- \( n = 17 \) (the number of years),
- \( PMT \) is the annual deposit to be calculated.

Rearranging the formula to solve for \( PMT \):

\[
PMT = \frac{FV}{\frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r}}
\]

First, calculate \( (1 + r)^n \), which is \( (1.05)^{17} \). Using precise calculations, \( (1.05)^{17} \approx 2.2920 \). Substituting this into the formula:

\[
PMT = \frac{20,000}{\frac{2.2920 - 1}{0.05}} = \frac{20,000}{\frac{1.2920}{0.05}} = \frac{20,000}{25.84} \approx 773.98
\]

Thus, Mrs. Ash needs to deposit approximately **$773.98** annually. Among the given options, the closest match is:

**B: $773.98**
