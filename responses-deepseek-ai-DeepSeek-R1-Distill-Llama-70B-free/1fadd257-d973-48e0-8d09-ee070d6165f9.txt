Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about the oldest permanent European settlement in the United States. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on my history, but I'll try to think it through.

The options are A through J, with places like Charlotte, San Juan, Savannah, Santa Fe, Jamestown, St Augustine, Newport News, New York, Plymouth, and Philadelphia. I remember that the early European settlements were mostly on the East Coast, so the answer is probably one of those.

I think Jamestown was the first successful English settlement. Wasn't that in Virginia around 1607? But wait, there's also St. Augustine in Florida. I've heard that it's older than Jamestown. Let me recall. St. Augustine was founded by the Spanish, right? I think it was established in 1565, which would make it older than Jamestown by about 40 years.

Wait, but the question is about the oldest permanent European settlement in the United States. So if St. Augustine was Spanish and Jamestown was English, which one came first? I'm pretty sure St. Augustine was earlier. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes people talk about Jamestown as the first, but that's from the English perspective.

Then there's Plymouth, which was the landing place of the Pilgrims in 1620. That's later than both Jamestown and St. Augustine. Santa Fe, New Mexico, I think was founded by the Spanish too, but I'm not sure of the exact date. Maybe around the early 1600s? So after St. Augustine.

San Juan, Puerto Rico, is another option. Puerto Rico was a Spanish colony, but I'm not certain when it was established. I think it's older than Jamestown, but is it older than St. Augustine? I'm not sure, but I think St. Augustine was the first in what's now the continental US.

So putting it all together: St. Augustine, Florida, was founded in 1565 by the Spanish, making it the oldest permanent European settlement in the US. Jamestown came later in 1607. So the correct answer should be F: St Augustine Florida.

The oldest permanent European settlement in the United States is St. Augustine, Florida. Established by the Spanish in 1565, it predates Jamestown, Virginia, which was founded in 1607.
