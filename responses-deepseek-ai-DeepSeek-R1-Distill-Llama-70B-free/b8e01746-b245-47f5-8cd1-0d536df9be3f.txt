Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the change in energy (ΔE) for a nuclear reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The reaction given is Boron-11 plus a proton (Hydrogen-1) forming Carbon-12, which then breaks down into three Helium-4 nuclei. So, the overall reaction is:

^11_5B + ^1_1H → ^12_6C → 3 * ^4_2He.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the intermediate step with Carbon-12 matters for the energy calculation. I think the key is to consider the initial reactants and the final products. So the net reaction is probably: ^11B + ^1H → 3 ^4He.

Now, I remember that in nuclear reactions, the mass of the reactants and products is important because mass loss (or gain) corresponds to energy release (or absorption) via Einstein's equation E=mc². So I need to calculate the mass defect to find ΔE.

The given atomic masses are:

^11B: 11.00931 u

^4He: 4.00260 u

^1H: 1.00783 u

So, the reactants are one Boron-11 and one proton. Wait, but the proton is Hydrogen-1, which is just a hydrogen atom without the electron, right? So the initial mass is 11.00931 (Boron) + 1.00783 (proton) = let me add those. 11.00931 + 1.00783 equals 12.01714 u.

The products are three Helium-4 nuclei. Each is 4.00260 u, so three would be 3 * 4.00260. Let me calculate that: 4.0026 *3 = 12.0078 u.

Wait, so the initial mass is 12.01714 u, and the final mass is 12.0078 u. So the mass loss is initial minus final: 12.01714 - 12.0078 = 0.00934 u.

Since mass is lost, energy is released, so ΔE should be negative because the reaction is exothermic.

Now, I need to convert this mass loss into energy. The conversion factor is 1 u = 931.5 MeV/c². So ΔE is the mass defect multiplied by 931.5 MeV per u.

So 0.00934 u * 931.5 MeV/u = let's compute that. 0.00934 * 931.5 ≈ let me calculate step by step.

0.009 * 931.5 = 8.3835, and 0.00034 *931.5≈0.3165. So total is approximately 8.3835 + 0.3165 = 8.7 MeV.

Wait, wait. Let me do it more accurately. 0.00934 * 931.5.

Let me compute 934 * 931.5, but since it's 0.00934, it's 934e-5 * 931.5e6 eV? Hmm, maybe it's easier to compute 0.00934 * 931.5.

0.009 * 931.5 = 8.3835

0.00034 * 931.5 = 0.31641.

Adding together: 8.3835 + 0.31641 = 8.69991 MeV. So approximately 8.7 MeV.

But wait, the question asks for the energy per mole. Oh right, because the options are in kcal per mole. So I need to convert from MeV per reaction to kcal per mole.

First, I need to find out how many reactions occur per mole. One mole is Avogadro's number, 6.022e23 reactions.

Each reaction releases 8.7 MeV, so per mole: 8.7e6 eV * 6.022e23 eV/mol.

Wait, 1 MeV is 1e6 eV, so 8.7 MeV is 8.7e6 eV.

So total energy per mole is 8.7e6 eV/reaction * 6.022e23 reactions/mol = 8.7e6 * 6.022e23 = let's compute that.

But wait, I think I should calculate it step by step.

Wait, actually, the energy per mole is (energy per reaction) * (Avogadro's number).

So, 8.7 MeV per reaction * 6.022e23 reactions/mol = 8.7 * 6.022e23 MeV/mol.

But wait, I need to convert MeV to kcal. Because the answer options are in kcal per mole.

What's the conversion between MeV and kcal?

I remember that 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. And 1 MeV is 1e6 eV. So 1 MeV = 1.602e-13 J.

But I also need to know how many MeV are in a kcal. Let me think: 1 kcal is approximately 4184 joules.

So 1 kcal = 4184 J.

So 1 MeV is 1.602e-13 J. So how many MeV are in one kcal?

Number of MeV per kcal = (4184 J) / (1.602e-13 J/MeV) ) 

So 4184 / 1.602e-13 = approx 2.613e16 MeV per kcal.

Wait, that seems high. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1 J = 1 kg m²/s². Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look up the conversion factor. I think 1 eV is 1.60218e-19 J. So 1 MeV = 1.60218e-13 J.

So to convert MeV to kcal, we can use the relation:

1 kcal = 4184 J.

So 1 MeV = 1.60218e-13 J = 1.60218e-13 /4184 kcal.

Which is approximately 3.827e-17 kcal per MeV.

Wait, so 1 MeV = 3.827e-17 kcal.

So to convert from MeV to kcal, multiply by 3.827e-17.

Wait, so the energy per mole is 8.7e6 eV * 6.022e23 reactions/mol * (1 MeV/1e6 eV) ) * (3.827e-17 kcal/MeV).

Wait, perhaps I should structure it more clearly.

Energy per reaction is 8.7 MeV.

Per mole, it's 8.7 MeV * 6.022e23 mol^-1.

So 8.7 * 6.022e23 = 5.24154e24 MeV/mol.

Convert MeV to kcal: multiply by 3.827e-17 kcal/MeV.

So 5.24154e24 * 3.827e-17 = let's compute that.

5.24154e24 * 3.827e-17 = (5.24154 * 3.827) * 1e(24-17) ) = (approx 20.05) * 1e7 = 2.005e8 kcal/mol.

Wait, but wait, that's positive 2e8 kcal per mole. But the mass was lost, so energy is released, so ΔE should be negative. So the answer would be approximately -2.005e8 kcal/mol.

Looking at the options:

Option F is -2.10e8

Option E is -2.01e8

Option D is -3.02e8

Wait, but my calculation is about -2.005e8, which is approximately -2.01e8. So that would be option E.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Sometimes I might make a mistake in the exponents.

Let me recompute the per mole energy:

Each reaction releases 8.7 MeV. So per mole, that's 8.7e6 eV * 6.022e23 reactions.

Wait, no: 1 MeV is 1e6 eV, so 8.7 MeV is 8.7e6 eV.

So per mole: 8.7e6 eV * 6.022e23 = 8.7e6 *6.022e23 = 5.2415e30 eV/mol.

But wait, that's a huge number. Now, convert eV to kcal.

Since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, and 1 kcal = 4184 J.

So 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J = 1.602e-19 /4184 kcal ≈ 3.827e-23 kcal.

So each eV is 3.827e-23 kcal.

So 5.2415e30 eV is equal to 5.2415e30 * 3.827e-23 kcal.

Compute 5.2415e30 *3.827e-23 = (5.2415 *3.827) * 1e7.

5.2415 *3.827 ≈ 20.05. So 20.05e7 = 2.005e8 kcal/mol.

So yes, that's 2.005e8 kcal, but since it's exothermic, it's -2.005e8.

Looking at the options, option E is -2.01e8, which matches.

But wait, let me check the exact mass calculation again to be precise. The initial mass was 11.00931 + 1.00783 = 12.01714 u.

The product is 3 *4.00260 = 12.0078 u.

Difference is 12.01714 -12.0078 = 0.00934 u. So that's the mass defect. So 0.00934 u converted to energy.

0.00934 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 0.00934 *931.5 = let's compute that accurately.

0.009 *931.5 = 8.3835.

0.00034 *931.5 = 0.31641.

So total is 8.3835 +0.31641= 8.69991 MeV. So approximately 8.7 MeV, which is what I used before.

So the calculation seems correct, leading to about -2.01e8 kcal/mol. So option E.

To calculate the change in energy (\( \Delta E \)) for the given nuclear reaction:

\[
^{11}_5\text{B} + ^{1}_1\text{H} \rightarrow ^{12}_6\text{C} \rightarrow 3 \, ^{4}_2\text{He},
\]

we use the atomic masses provided:

- \( ^{11}\text{B} = 11.00931 \, \text{u} \),
- \( ^{1}\text{H} = 1.00783 \, \text{u} \),
- \( ^{4}\text{He} = 4.00260 \, \text{u} \).

### Step 1: Calculate the initial and final masses
The initial mass of the reactants is:
\[
\text{Initial mass} = 11.00931 + 1.00783 = 12.01714 \, \text{u}.
\]

The final mass of the products is:
\[
\text{Final mass} = 3 \times 4.00260 = 12.00780 \, \text{u}.
\]

The mass defect (\( \Delta m \)) is:
\[
\Delta m = \text{Initial mass} - \text{Final mass} = 12.01714 - 12.00780 = 0.00934 \, \text{u}.
\]

### Step 2: Convert the mass defect to energy
Using Einstein's equation \( E = \Delta m \cdot c^2 \), where \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), the energy released is:
\[
\Delta E = 0.00934 \cdot 931.5 = 8.7 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Step 3: Convert energy to kcal per mole
To convert \( \Delta E \) from MeV per reaction to kcal per mole, we use Avogadro's number (\( N_A = 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{mol}^{-1} \)) and the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{MeV} = 3.827 \times 10^{-17} \, \text{kcal} \).

The energy per mole is:
\[
\Delta E = 8.7 \cdot 10^6 \, \text{eV} \cdot 6.022 \times 10^{23} \cdot 3.827 \times 10^{-17} \, \text{kcal}.
\]

First, calculate:
\[
8.7 \cdot 6.022 = 52.4154.
\]

Then:
\[
52.4154 \cdot 3.827 = 200.5 \, \text{kcal/mol}.
\]

Thus:
\[
\Delta E = -2.005 \times 10^8 \, \text{kcal/mol}.
\]

### Step 4: Match the closest option
The calculated value of \( \Delta E \) is approximately \( -2.01 \times 10^8 \, \text{kcal/mol} \), which corresponds to **Option E**.
