Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about relative speeds of two electrons. Hmm, they're moving at 0.90c and 0.80c. I remember that when objects are moving at speeds comparable to the speed of light, you can't just subtract their speeds like you normally would. Oh right, it's because of special relativity. So I need to use the velocity addition formula.

Wait, the question has two parts: (a) when they're moving in the same direction and (b) when they're moving in opposite directions. I think for same direction, I subtract their speeds, but adjusted with that formula. And for opposite, maybe I add them?

The formula I remember is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)), where u is the velocity of object A in the frame of object B, I think. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think. Oh wait, the formula is used when you have two velocities in the same frame, and you want the velocity of one as seen from the other's frame.

Wait, let me get this straight. Suppose electron A is moving at speed v_A = 0.90c, and electron B at v_B = 0.80c. But wait, the direction matters. If they're moving in the same direction, like both in the positive x direction, then the relative speed of A as seen from B would be different than if they're moving towards each other.

So for part (a), same direction. Let's say A is moving faster than B. So in B's frame, what's A's speed? I think the formula applies here. So u is v_A, and v is v_B, but wait, no. Wait, the formula is when you have a frame S and a frame S' moving at velocity v relative to S. Then the velocity u in S is observed as u' in S'.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think of it this way: if I'm in the rest frame of B, what is the speed of A?

So B is at rest in his own frame, and A is moving. So to find the speed of A relative to B when both are moving in the same direction in the lab frame, I use the velocity addition formula.

The formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). So in this case, u is 0.90c, v is 0.80c, since B is moving at 0.80c in the lab frame. Wait no, wait. Let's clarify. If in the lab frame, B is moving at 0.80c, and A is moving at 0.90c in same direction. So the speed of A in B's frame is u' = (0.90c - 0.80c)/(1 - (0.90c * 0.80c)/(c²)).

Calculating numerator: 0.10c. Denominator: 1 - (0.72 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.72 = 0.28.

So u' = (0.10c)/0.28 ≈ 0.3571c. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 0.357c as an option. Let me check the options again. The options are only for same direction and opposite.

Oh wait, the options are pairs. Let's see. Option J is 0.36c and 0.99c. 0.36 is close to 0.357, right? Hmm. So part (a) would be 0.36c. But wait, let me recalculate.

Wait, 0.10c / 0.28 is 0.10 / 0.28 = 1/2.8 ≈ 0.357. So 0.357c approximately. So 0.36c, which matches option J's first part.

Now for part (b), when moving in opposite directions. So in the lab frame, A is moving at 0.90c, say to the right, and B is moving to the left at 0.80c. So in B's frame, what's the speed of A? Or wait, maybe I should think of it as B moving in the opposite direction, so relative to A.

Wait wait, no. Wait, if the electrons are moving in opposite directions, then their velocities in the lab frame are in opposite directions. So I think the velocities are u = 0.90c, and v = -0.80c (since it's opposite direction). But wait, when using the velocity addition formula, do I take v as negative?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is that when moving towards each other, the relative speed is higher. So the formula would be u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c² ). Wait, because if they're moving towards each other, one velocity is positive and the other is negative. So, for example, if in the lab frame, A is moving at u = 0.90c to the right, and B is moving at v = 0.80c to the left, so v = -0.80c.

So applying the formula u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Wait, no, because in this case, the velocity of A in B's frame would be calculated as (u - v_B)/(1 - (u v_B)/c²). Wait, perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong.

Wait, the formula is for transforming velocities. If frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to S, then the velocity u' of an object in S' is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²).

So in our case, for part (b), if B is moving in the opposite direction, then in the lab frame, B's velocity is v = -0.80c. So to find the speed of A as seen from B's frame, we plug into the formula.

u is 0.90c, v is -0.80c.

So u' = (0.90c - (-0.80c)) / (1 - (0.90c * (-0.80c))/c² )

Calculate numerator: 0.90c + 0.80c = 1.70c.

Denominator: 1 - [ (0.90 * (-0.80) ) c² ] / c². So 0.90 * (-0.80) = -0.72. So denominator is 1 - (-0.72) = 1 + 0.72 = 1.72.

So u' = 1.70c / 1.72 ≈ 0.988c. Hmm, but looking at the options, which one matches this?

Looking at option J, part (b) is 0.99c. So 0.988 is close to 0.99c. So in this case, part (a) is 0.36c, part (b) is ~0.99c. So the correct option would be J: 0.36c and 0.99c.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option J: 0.36c and 0.99c.

Yes, that's what I got. So the answer should be J.

To solve the problem, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

where \( u \) and \( v \) are the velocities of the objects in the lab frame, and \( u' \) is the relative velocity of one object as seen from the other's frame.

### Part (a): Same Direction
If both electrons are moving in the same direction, with \( u = 0.90c \) and \( v = 0.80c \), the relative velocity of A with respect to B is:

\[
u' = \frac{0.90c - 0.80c}{1 - \frac{(0.90c)(0.80c)}{c^2}}
\]

1. Numerator: \( 0.90c - 0.80c = 0.10c \)
2. Denominator: \( 1 - \frac{(0.90)(0.80)}{1} = 1 - 0.72 = 0.28 \)

\[
u' = \frac{0.10c}{0.28} \approx 0.357c
\]

This rounds to \( 0.36c \), which matches the first part of option J.

---

### Part (b): Opposite Directions
If the electrons are moving in opposite directions, we treat one velocity as negative. Let \( u = 0.90c \) and \( v = -0.80c \). The relative velocity of A with respect to B is:

\[
u' = \frac{0.90c - (-0.80c)}{1 - \frac{(0.90c)(-0.80c)}{c^2}}
\]

1. Numerator: \( 0.90c + 0.80c = 1.70c \)
2. Denominator: \( 1 - \frac{(0.90)(-0.80)}{1} = 1 + 0.72 = 1.72 \)

\[
u' = \frac{1.70c}{1.72} \approx 0.988c
\]

This rounds to \( 0.99c \), which matches the second part of option J.

---

### Final Answer
The relative speeds are \( 0.36c \) (same direction) and \( 0.99c \) (opposite directions), corresponding to option J.
