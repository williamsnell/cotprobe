Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have an ensemble of a mole of particles, and each particle has two energy levels separated by 1000 cm^-1. We need to find the temperature at which the internal energy equals 3.00 kJ. The options are given from A to J.

Hmm, right. I remember that for a two-level system, the internal energy depends on the temperature and the energy gap between the levels. Oh wait, the two-level system model is something like each particle can be in the ground state or the excited state. The energy difference is given by delta E, which here is 1000 cm^-1. But wait, I need to convert that into joules because the internal energy is given in kJ.

Wait, how do I convert cm^-1 to joules? I think 1 cm^-1 is approximately 1.986e-23 J. Or wait, maybe it's 1.986e-23 J per cm^-1? Let me double-check. Oh right, because energy E = h c / lambda, and when lambda is in cm, 1 cm^-1 corresponds to hc/(1 cm) which is around 1.986e-23 J.

So for 1000 cm^-1, delta E = 1000 * 1.986e-23 J ≈ 1.986e-20 J per particle.

Wait, but wait, the particles are in a mole, so Avogadro's number comes into play. Oh wait, the ensemble is a mole of particles, so N is Avogadro's number, roughly 6.022e23 particles.

But wait, the internal energy U is given as 3.00 kJ. So U = 3000 J.

The formula for internal energy for a two-level system... I think it's U = (N * delta E) * (1 / (e^{(delta E)/(k T)} + 1)).

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The average energy per particle in a two-level system is given by (delta E) * (probability of being in the excited state). The probability is given by the Boltzmann distribution, right? So the average energy is (delta E) * (1 / (e^{(delta E)/(k T)} + 1)).

Therefore, the total internal energy U is N * (delta E) * [1 / (e^{(delta E)/(k T)} + 1)].

Wait, but wait: if the energy levels are E1 and E2, with E2 > E1, then the energy difference is delta E = E2 - E1. But in the two-level system, each particle can be in either E1 or E2. So the average energy per particle is E1 + (E2 - E1) * (probability of being in E2).

Wait, no. Alternatively, the partition function for two levels is Z = 1 + e^{-beta delta E}, where beta is 1/(k T). So the average energy per particle is (0 * 1 + delta E * e^{-beta delta E}) / Z. So that would be delta E * e^{-beta delta E} / (1 + e^{-beta delta E}).

Which can be rewritten as delta E / (e^{beta delta E} + 1), right? Because e^{-x} = 1/e^x. So yeah, the average energy per particle is delta E / (e^{(delta E)/(k T)} + 1). Therefore, U = N * delta E / (e^{(delta E)/(k T)} + 1).

So, putting it all together, we have:

U = (N delta E) / (e^{(delta E)/(k T)} + 1)

We need to solve for T when U=3000 J, N is Avogadro's number (6.022e23), delta E is 1000 cm^-1 converted to J, which is 1.986e-20 J.

So let's plug in the numbers.

First, compute N delta E: 6.022e23 * 1.986e-20 J.

Calculating that: 6.022e23 * 2e-20 is roughly 1.2e4 J, but let me be precise.

6.022e23 * 1.986e-20 = 6.022 * 1.986 * 1e3 = let's compute 6.022 * 2 is about 12.044, but 1.986 is a little less than 2, so maybe 12 * 1e3 = 12,000 J? Wait, 6.022 * 1.986 is approximately: 6*2 is 12, but 0.022*1.986 is about 0.0437. So total is roughly 12.0437, times 1e3 is 12,043.7 J. So N delta E is about 12,044 J, or approximately 12 kJ.

Wait, but our U is 3000 J, which is 3 kJ. So U is 3000 J, which is 1/4 of N delta E.

Wait, because N delta E is approximately 12,044 J, so 3000 J is about 0.25 of that. So 3000 = (12,044) / (e^{(delta E)/(k T)} + 1 )

So 3000 = 12044 / (e^{x} +1 ), where x = delta E/(k T).

Wait, let me write the equation:

U = (N delta E) / (e^{(delta E)/(k T)} +1 )

We have U = 3000 J, N delta E ≈ 12044 J.

So 3000 = 12044 / (e^x +1 ), where x = delta E/(k T)

Rearranging:

e^x +1 = 12044 / 3000 ≈ 4.0147

So e^x ≈ 4.0147 -1 = 3.0147

Take natural log of both sides: x ≈ ln(3.0147) ≈ 1.102.

So x = delta E/(k T) = 1.102.

We can solve for T:

T = delta E/(k x)

But wait, delta E is 1000 cm^-1 converted to J: 1.986e-20 J.

k is Boltzmann's constant, which is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So T = (1.986e-20 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K * 1.102 )

Let me compute the denominator first: 1.38e-23 * 1.102 ≈ 1.38 * 1.102 = approx 1.52076, so 1.52076e-23 J/K.

So T = (1.986e-20) / (1.52076e-23) K.

Compute that division:

1.986e-20 / 1.52076e-23 = (1.986 / 1.52076) * 1e3 ≈ (approx 1.306) * 1e3 ≈ 1306 K.

Hmm, looking at the options, J is 1310 K, which is very close. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to be precise.

First, the exact value of delta E: 1000 cm^-1 is 1000 * (hc)/ (1 cm). Let's compute it accurately.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
c = 3e8 m/s = 3e6 cm/s.

So E = h c / lambda => 6.626e-34 * 3e6 cm/s / (1 cm) = 6.626e-34 * 3e6 = 1.9878e-27 J·cm, so 1 cm^-1 is 1.9878e-27 J. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 1 cm is 1e-2 m, but I think the standard conversion is 1 cm^-1 is approximately 1.986e-23 J. Oh wait, I think I might have made a mistake there earlier.

Wait, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. And 1 cm^-1 is about 0.00126 eV, because 1 eV ≈ 8065.54 cm^-1. So 1 cm^-1 ≈ 1.2398e-4 eV, which in J is 1.2398e-4 * 1.602e-19 ≈ 1.986e-23 J. So yes, 1000 cm^-1 is 1.986e-20 J. So that part was correct.

So N delta E: Avogadro's number is 6.022e23 mol^-1. So 6.022e23 * 1.986e-20 = let's compute that exactly.

6.022e23 * 1.986e-20 = (6.022 * 1.986) * 1e3.

6.022 * 2 is 12.044, but 1.986 is 2 - 0.014. So 6.022 * 1.986 = 6.022*(2 - 0.014) = 6.022 * 2 = 12.044 minus 6.022 * 0.014 = 0.084308. So 12.044 - 0.084308 = 11.95969. So approximately 11.95969e3 J, which is 11,959.69 J, roughly 11,960 J.

So U = 3000 J = 11,960 J / (e^{x} +1 )

So 3000 = 11960 / (e^x +1 )

Rearranged, e^x +1 = 11960 / 3000 ≈ 3.9866667.

So e^x = 3.9866667 -1 = 2.9866667.

Take ln: x ≈ ln(2.9866667) ≈ 1.0953.

So x = delta E/(k T) = 1.0953.

Then T = delta E/(k x) = (1.986e-20 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K * 1.0953)

Compute denominator: 1.38e-23 * 1.0953 ≈ let's compute 1.38 * 1.0953.

1.38 * 1 = 1.38, 1.38 * 0.0953 ≈ 0.1315. So total ≈ 1.38 + 0.1315 = 1.5115.

So denominator is 1.5115e-23 J/K.

So T = 1.986e-20 / 1.5115e-23 ≈ (1.986 / 1.5115) * 1e3.

1.986 / 1.5115 ≈ let's see: 1.5115 * 1.3 is about 1.964, which is close to 1.986. So 1.3 times 1.5115 is 1.964. The difference is 1.986 -1.964 = 0.022. So 0.022 / 1.5115 ≈ 0.0145. So total is approximately 1.3145.

So T ≈ 1.3145e3 K, which is 1314.5 K.

Hmm, looking at the options, option J is 1310 K, which is very close. So the correct answer should be J.

To solve the problem, we analyze the two-level system where the energy difference between the levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1000 \, \mathrm{cm}^{-1} \). Converting this to joules using \( 1 \, \mathrm{cm}^{-1} \approx 1.986 \times 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{J} \), we find:

\[
\Delta E = 1000 \times 1.986 \times 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{J} = 1.986 \times 10^{-20} \, \mathrm{J}.
\]

The ensemble consists of \( N = 6.022 \times 10^{23} \) particles (one mole). The internal energy \( U \) of the system is related to the temperature \( T \) by the formula:

\[
U = \frac{N \Delta E}{e^{\Delta E / (k T)} + 1},
\]

where \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{J/K} \) is the Boltzmann constant. Substituting \( U = 3000 \, \mathrm{J} \), \( N \Delta E = 6.022 \times 10^{23} \times 1.986 \times 10^{-20} \, \mathrm{J} \approx 11,960 \, \mathrm{J} \), and solving for \( T \), we rewrite the equation as:

\[
3000 = \frac{11,960}{e^{\Delta E / (k T)} + 1}.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
e^{\Delta E / (k T)} + 1 = \frac{11,960}{3000} \approx 3.987,
\]

\[
e^{\Delta E / (k T)} \approx 2.987.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k T} = \ln(2.987) \approx 1.095.
\]

Solving for \( T \):

\[
T = \frac{\Delta E}{k \cdot 1.095}.
\]

Substituting \( \Delta E = 1.986 \times 10^{-20} \, \mathrm{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{J/K} \):

\[
T = \frac{1.986 \times 10^{-20}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23} \cdot 1.095} \approx \frac{1.986}{1.38 \cdot 1.095} \times 10^3 \, \mathrm{K}.
\]

First, calculate the denominator:

\[
1.38 \cdot 1.095 \approx 1.511.
\]

Then:

\[
T \approx \frac{1.986}{1.511} \times 10^3 \approx 1.314 \times 10^3 \, \mathrm{K} \approx 1314 \, \mathrm{K}.
\]

The closest option to this value is \( 1310 \, \mathrm{K} \), which corresponds to option J.
