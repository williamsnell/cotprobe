Okay, so I need to figure out the correct answer to this question about a school psychologist and a non-custodial parent's request for test results. Let me start by understanding the scenario.

The question says that Dr. Maxine Miller is a school psychologist who administered some tests to a 5th-grade student, the son of a non-custodial father. The father is asking for the test results. The question is about whether Dr. Miller's compliance is ethical, legal, within her professional rights, or a combination of these.

I remember that in the U.S., there's a federal law called FERPA, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. FERPA protects the privacy of students' educational records, including test results. Generally, schools can't disclose these records without parental consent. But wait, this is about a non-custodial parent. Does FERPA apply the same way?

I think FERPA allows schools to disclose records to both custodial and non-custodial parents unless there's a court order or some other restriction. So the school might be legally required to provide the records to the father upon request, unless certain exceptions apply.

But wait, I might be mixing things up. There's also the consideration of professional ethics. As a school psychologist, Dr. Miller would be bound by ethical standards, probably the NASP (National Association of School Psychologists) Principles for Professional Ethics. 

NASP's ethical code talks about confidentiality and informed consent. Psychologists must protect the confidentiality of students' information and only disclose it with proper authorization. But in schools, the rules can be a bit different because parents (or legal guardians) have certain rights. However, if the parent is non-custodial, do those rights still apply?

I'm a bit unsure here. So, under FERPA, schools can provide records to non-custodial parents, but sometimes there are state laws that might affect this. For example, if the custodial parent has a court order restricting access, the school might not be allowed to share the information. But if there's no such order, FERPA would require the school to provide the records when requested by a parent, including non-custodial ones.

So, legally, Dr. Miller would be required to provide the test results to the father. But from an ethical standpoint, I need to consider her professional obligations. The NASP ethics code would require her to respect confidentiality, but she also has to comply with legal requirements. If the law requires disclosure, she might have to do so, but she should inform the student and the custodial parent if possible.

Wait, but in this case, the question is about whether she acted ethically and legally if she complies. So, if FERPA says she must provide the records, then complying is legal. As for ethics, as long as she's following the law, which allows disclosure to parents, she's acting ethically because she's adhering to legal standards that protect student privacy but also honor parental rights.

So, putting it together: if she complies, she's acting legally because FERPA requires it (assuming no court order preventing it), and ethically because she's following both the law and professional guidelines that require her to respect parental access to their child's records.

Therefore, the correct answer would be that she acted legally and ethically. Looking at the options, option J says "legally and ethically," which would be the correct choice.

The correct answer is based on the analysis that Dr. Miller, as a school psychologist, is subject to both legal and ethical standards. Under FERPA, schools are generally required to provide educational records, including test results, to parents upon request, including non-custodial parents, unless restricted by a court order. Ethically, Dr. Miller must adhere to confidentiality but also comply with legal obligations, which in this case align with professional ethical standards.
