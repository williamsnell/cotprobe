Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about jurisprudence, and I need to figure it out. The question is asking about who recognized the distinction between general and particular jurisprudence. The options are from A to I, with various legal theorists and philosophers listed.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to remember. Let me think about each option one by one. 

First, I know that jurisprudence is the philosophy of law, dealing with fundamental questions about the nature of law. The terms 'general' and 'particular' jurisprudence probably refer to different approaches or scopes within this field.

Option A: Kelsen. Hans Kelsen was known for his pure theory of law. I think he focused more on the structure and hierarchy of legal norms, but I'm not sure if he specifically discussed general vs. particular jurisprudence.

Option B: Hart. H.L.A. Hart was a key figure in analytical jurisprudence. His work, like "The Concept of Law," deals with understanding the structure of legal systems. He talked about primary and secondary rules, but again, not sure about the general vs. particular part.

Option C: Roscoe Pound. Pound was an American jurist who developed sociological jurisprudence. He emphasized the role of law in society and the need for law to adapt to social needs. I'm not certain if he made this specific distinction.

Option D: Dworkin. Ronald Dworkin is known for his theory of law as integrity and the concept of rights as trumps. His work is more about the interpretation of law, so maybe not the one here.

Option E: Austin. John Austin was a utilitarian and one of the early legal positivists. He defined law as the command of a sovereign, backed by sanctions. Not sure about the general/particular here.

Option F: Holland. Thomas Erskine Holland was a legal scholar who wrote about the elements of jurisprudence. Wait, I think he might have discussed different branches of jurisprudence, perhaps making this distinction. I recall that general jurisprudence deals with universal principles across all legal systems, while particular looks at specific systems. Maybe Holland talked about this.

Option G: Blackstone. William Blackstone wrote the famous Commentaries on the Laws of England. His work is more descriptive of English law rather than theoretical, so probably not him.

Option H: Holmes. Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. was a proponent of legal realism. He talked about law as a prediction of court decisions. Not sure if he made this distinction.

Option I: Salmond. John William Salmond wrote about jurisprudence and the theory of law. I think he might have categorized types of jurisprudence, perhaps into general and particular.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to remember the specific terms. I think that the distinction between general and particular (or universal and particular) jurisprudence was discussed by Thomas Erskine Holland in his work "The Elements of Jurisprudence." General jurisprudence would focus on the principles common to all legal systems, while particular jurisprudence would look at the specific laws and structures of a particular country or system.

Alternatively, Salmond might have also discussed this. I'm a bit torn between F and I. Another thought: Salmond's work is titled "Jurisprudence: The Theory of Law," and in it, he does talk about different kinds of jurisprudence. But I'm not certain if he specifically used the terms general and particular.

Wait, I think the correct answer is F: Holland because I remember that he made a clear distinction between general and particular. General deals with universal principles, while particular focuses on specific legal systems or contexts.

So I'll go with F.

The question asks about who recognized the distinction between general and particular jurisprudence. After analyzing the options:

- **Kelsen (A)** focused on the structure of legal norms but didn't specifically address this distinction.
- **Hart (B)** discussed primary and secondary rules but not general vs. particular jurisprudence.
- **Pound (C)** emphasized sociological jurisprudence, not this specific distinction.
- **Dworkin (D)** focused on law as integrity and rights, unrelated to this distinction.
- **Austin (E)** defined law as a sovereign's command, not relevant here.
- **Holland (F)**, in "The Elements of Jurisprudence," clearly distinguished between general (universal principles) and particular (specific legal systems) jurisprudence.
- **Blackstone (G)** wrote descriptive works on English law, not theoretical distinctions.
- **Holmes (H)** discussed legal realism, not this distinction.
- **Salmond (I)** wrote on jurisprudence but didn't specifically use these terms.

The correct answer is **F: Holland**, as he explicitly made this distinction in his work.

Answer: F
