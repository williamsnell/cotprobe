Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a magnifying glass. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on optics, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says: A magnifying glass with a focal length of 6 cm is used by someone whose smallest distance of distinct vision is 25 cm. He holds the glass close to his eye. I need to find the best position of the object from the options given.

Wait, so I remember that a magnifying glass is used in two different ways. One is when the object is placed at the focal point, creating a virtual image at infinity, which is useful for someone with normal vision. But wait, in this case, the person's near point is 25 cm. Oh right, because normally, the near point for humans is about 25 cm, but some might have it different. So maybe that's a clue here.

When you use a magnifying glass, you usually hold it so that the object is within the focal length, because that's how you get a magnified virtual image. Oh right, the lens formula is 1/f = 1/v + 1/u. But wait, in this case, the image is formed at the near point since the person is holding the glass close to their eye. So the image distance v should be equal to the near point, which is 25 cm. Or wait, no, because when the magnifying glass is used, the image is formed at infinity when the object is at the focal point. But maybe in this scenario, the image is formed at the near point because the person is holding it close, so perhaps they're accommodating the image formation at their near point.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify. When you use a magnifying glass properly, the object is placed just inside the focal point, so that the image is virtual and on the same side as the object, and the image is at infinity. But if someone can't see distant objects clearly, perhaps because they're myopic or have some other vision problem, the image needs to be formed at their near point instead. Oh, right, because for a myopic person, their near point is closer than normal.

Wait, no. Wait, the near point is the closest point where they can see objects clearly. So if the person's near point is 25 cm, that's actually farther than the typical 25 cm, wait no, wait. Wait, typical near point is about 25 cm for a normal human. So if this person's near point is 25 cm, that's normal. So maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, wait, the magnifying glass is a convex lens. When used as a magnifying glass, the object is placed just inside the focal point, so the image is virtual, upright, and enlarged. The image is formed at infinity when the object is at f. But if the person's eye is placed close to the lens, then perhaps the image is formed at their near point, which is 25 cm.

So in this case, the image distance v would be the near point, but since the image is virtual, the sign conventions come into play. I think in optics, the object distance is usually positive when it's on the same side as the incoming light, and the image distance is positive when it's on the opposite side (real image). But for virtual images, the image distance is negative.

Wait, the sign conventions can be tricky. Let me think: using the standard Cartesian sign convention, the object distance u is positive if the object is on the same side as the incoming light (which it usually is). The focal length f is positive for converging lenses. The image distance v is positive if the image is on the opposite side (real image) and negative if on the same side as the object (virtual image).

So in this case, the image is virtual, so v is negative. The near point is 25 cm, but since it's a virtual image, v would be -25 cm.

Wait, no. Wait, the near point is the closest distance where the eye can focus. So when the object is placed at the near point, the eye can see it clearly. But when using a magnifying glass, the virtual image is formed at the near point, so the image distance is at v = -25 cm.

Wait, but when the magnifying glass is used, the image is formed at infinity if the object is at the focal point. But in this problem, the person is holding the glass close to their eye, so perhaps the image is formed at their near point instead. So the image is at v = -25 cm, because it's a virtual image on the same side as the object.

So the focal length f is 6 cm. So using the lens formula: 1/f = 1/v + 1/u. We can plug in f=6 cm, v=-25 cm, and solve for u, the object distance.

Let me compute that. 1/6 = 1/(-25) + 1/u. Let's solve for 1/u.

1/u = 1/6 - 1/(-25) = 1/6 + 1/25.

Calculating that: 1/6 is approximately 0.1667, 1/25 is 0.04. Sum is 0.2067. So 1/u is about 0.2067, so u is 1 / 0.2067 ≈ 4.837 cm. So approximately 4.84 cm.

Looking at the options, option C is 4.84 cm, which is the closest. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake with signs. Let me recheck.

The formula: 1/f = 1/v + 1/u.

If the image is virtual and on the same side as the object, then v is negative. So in this case, v is -25 cm.

So 1/u = (1/f) - (1/v) → because 1/v is negative.

Wait, 1/f is positive (f is positive, converging lens). 1/v is negative because v is negative. So 1/u = 1/f - (1/v) → wait, no, 1/u = (1/f) - (1/v) because 1/v is negative, so subtracting a negative becomes adding.

Wait, wait, let me do it more carefully.

1/f = 1/v + 1/u → 1/u = 1/f - 1/v.

But wait, v is -25, so 1/v is -0.04. So 1/u = (1/6) - (-1/25) → 1/6 + 1/25.

Yes, that's correct. So 1/u = (25 + 6) / (6*25) ) → 31 / 150 → approximately 0.2067.

So u is 150/31 ≈ 4.8387 cm, which is approximately 4.84 cm.

So the correct answer is option C: 4.84 cm.

To determine the best position of the object when using a magnifying glass with a focal length of 6 cm, we need to calculate the object distance \( u \) such that the virtual image is formed at the person's near point of 25 cm. 

The lens formula is:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{v} + \frac{1}{u}
\]

Here:
- \( f = 6 \, \text{cm} \) (focal length of the magnifying glass),
- \( v = -25 \, \text{cm} \) (image distance, negative because the image is virtual and on the same side as the object).

Rearranging the formula to solve for \( \frac{1}{u} \):

\[
\frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{f} - \frac{1}{v}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{6} - \frac{1}{-25} = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{25}
\]

Calculating:

\[
\frac{1}{6} \approx 0.1667, \quad \frac{1}{25} = 0.04, \quad \frac{1}{u} \approx 0.2067
\]

Thus:

\[
u = \frac{1}{0.2067} \approx 4.84 \, \text{cm}
\]

This means the object should be placed approximately 4.84 cm from the lens for the virtual image to be formed at the person's near point. Among the given options, the closest value is **4.84 cm**, which corresponds to option **C**.
