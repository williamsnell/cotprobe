Okay, so I've got this question about gravitational redshift, and I'm trying to figure it out. Hmm, gravitational redshift is when light or a photon escapes a gravitational well and shifts to a longer wavelength, right? I remember the formula for gravitational redshift is something like z = (GM)/(Rc²), but wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact expression. Let me think. Oh right, the gravitational redshift formula is given by (1 + z) = sqrt(1 - (2GM)/(Rc²)), but for weak fields, like around the Sun, this can be approximated. Oh wait, yeah, because when the gravitational potential is weak, the approximation is z ≈ GM/(Rc²). So that's the formula I should use here.

The question is asking for the magnitude of the gravitational redshift for a photon traveling from the Sun to the Earth. So the photon is moving from the Sun's surface to a distant point, which in this case is Earth's orbit. 

I need to calculate z, which is the redshift parameter. The formula is z = (GM)/(Rc²). Okay, but wait, M is the mass of the Sun, and R is the radius of the Sun, right? Because the photon is escaping from the Sun's gravity. So we'll use the Sun's mass and radius in the calculation.

Let me jot down the values I need. The gravitational constant G is 6.674×10^-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2. The mass of the Sun, M, is about 1.989×10^30 kg. The radius of the Sun, R, is approximately 6.96×10^8 meters. And the speed of light c is 3×10^8 m/s.

Plugging these into the formula: z = (G*M)/(R*c²). Let's compute each part step by step.

First calculate the numerator: G*M. So 6.674e-11 * 1.989e30. Let me compute that. 6.674 * 1.989 is approximately 13.28, and the exponents are 10^-11 * 10^30 = 10^19. So that's 13.28e19, which is 1.328e20.

Now the denominator is R*c². R is 6.96e8 m, c squared is (3e8)^2 = 9e16. Multiply 6.96e8 *9e16. 6.96 *9 is 62.64, and 10^8 *10^16 is 10^24. So denominator is 62.64e24, which is 6.264e25.

So now z is numerator divided by denominator: 1.328e20 / 6.264e25. Let me compute that. 1.328 /6.264 is approximately 0.212, and 10^20 /10^25 is 10^-5. So 0.212e-5, which is 2.12e-6. Wait, but wait a second, that gives z as about 2.12e-6, which is 0.00000212.

Looking at the options, option E is 0.0000021, which is very close. So are there any factors I might have missed?

Wait, let me double-check the calculation. Let me compute G*M/(R c^2) again more accurately.

G = 6.67430e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²
M = 1.9885e30 kg
R = 6.957e8 m
c = 3e8 m/s

Compute numerator: G*M = 6.6743e-11 * 1.9885e30

6.6743 * 1.9885 ≈ let's calculate that: 6 *1.9885 is about 11.931, 0.6743*1.9885≈1.341. So total approx 13.272. So 13.272e19, which is 1.3272e20.

Denominator: R c² = 6.957e8 * (3e8)^2 = 6.957e8 *9e16 = 6.957 *9 = 62.613e24 = 6.2613e25.

So z = 1.3272e20 / 6.2613e25 = (1.3272 /6.2613) * 1e-5.

1.3272 /6.2613 ≈ 0.212.

So 0.212e-5 is 2.12e-6, which is 0.00000212. So that's about 0.0000021, which matches option E.

Wait, but some sources say that the observed value is about 2.12e-6, which is 0.00000212. So yeah, option E is 0.0000021, which fits.

I think that's correct. So the answer should be E.

To calculate the magnitude of the gravitational redshift for a photon traveling from the Sun to the Earth, we use the formula for gravitational redshift in a weak gravitational field:

\[
z \approx \frac{GM}{Rc^2}
\]

Here:
- \( G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \, \text{kg}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-2} \) (gravitational constant),
- \( M = 1.989 \times 10^{30} \, \text{kg} \) (mass of the Sun),
- \( R = 6.96 \times 10^8 \, \text{m} \) (radius of the Sun),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light).

### Step 1: Compute the numerator \( GM \)
\[
GM = (6.674 \times 10^{-11}) \times (1.989 \times 10^{30}) = 1.3272 \times 10^{20}
\]

### Step 2: Compute the denominator \( Rc^2 \)
\[
Rc^2 = (6.96 \times 10^8) \times (3 \times 10^8)^2 = (6.96 \times 10^8) \times (9 \times 10^{16}) = 6.2613 \times 10^{25}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( z \)
\[
z = \frac{GM}{Rc^2} = \frac{1.3272 \times 10^{20}}{6.2613 \times 10^{25}} = (1.3272 / 6.2613) \times 10^{-5} \approx 0.212 \times 10^{-5} = 2.12 \times 10^{-6}
\]

Thus, the gravitational redshift magnitude is approximately \( z = 0.00000212 \).

### Step 4: Match with the options
The closest option to \( 0.00000212 \) is **E: 0.0000021**.
