E: The contractor dies before the home owner accepts but the contractor's son intends to continue the business.
F: The home owner tells the contractor they have found another contractor who will do the job for $90,000.
G: The home owner states "I accept your offer but the price is to be $97,000."

Okay, so I've got this question about contract law, specifically about what doesn't terminate an offer. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me start by recalling what I know about offers and their termination.

An offer is a promise to do something in exchange for performance, and it can be revoked or terminated in several ways. The key here is which communication does NOT terminate the offer, meaning the offer remains open so a subsequent acceptance would still be effective.

The question is about a contractor and a homeowner negotiating the price for building a house. The contractor offered $100k, and we're looking at which of the options doesn't terminate that offer.

Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Homeowner says they've decided to build themselves. That sounds like a rejection. If the offeree (homeowner) rejects the offer, does that terminate it? I think rejection doesn't terminate the offer; it just means they're not accepting. So the offer could still be open unless it's been revoked or lapsed.

Option B: Contractor says materials cost more, needs renegotiation. So the contractor is the offeror. I think this might be a revocation because they're indicating they don't want to proceed on the original terms. So this would terminate the offer.

Option C: Homeowner asks if contractor would do it for $95k. That's a counteroffer, right? Making a counteroffer usually rejects the original offer and terminates it. But wait, is it a counteroffer or just an inquiry? Because asking if they'd be willing could be a counteroffer, but sometimes it's seen as just a question. Hmm, I think it's a counteroffer, which would terminate the original offer.

Option D: Homeowner asks if they can finish in six months. That's just a question about terms, not an acceptance or rejection. So this doesn't terminate the offer. It's just seeking information. So the offer remains open. This might be the correct answer.

Option E: Contractor dies, son continues business. If the offeror dies, the offer is revoked because the contractor can no longer perform. Unless the son is taking over, but I think the offer is revoked upon death unless the business continues seamlessly, but I'm not sure. Some sources say that if the offeror dies, the offer is terminated unless it's a firm offer or the business continues. But this might be a termination, so the offer is no longer valid.

Option F: Homeowner found another contractor for $90k. This is a rejection, right? So the offer isn't terminated, but the homeowner isn't accepting. So the offer could still be open unless the offeror revokes it.

Option G: Homeowner accepts but changes the price to $97k. That's a counteroffer, which terminates the original offer. So this wouldn't allow a subsequent acceptance because the original is terminated.

Option H: Contractor withdraws the offer. That's a clear revocation. So the offer is terminated.

Option I: Contractor increases the offer to $105k. That's a revocation of the original offer and making a new one. So the original offer is terminated.

Option J: Contractor's business goes bankrupt. That would likely terminate the offer because they can't perform. So the offer is revoked.

Wait, so the question is which communication does NOT terminate the offer. So the one that doesn't terminate is the correct answer.

Looking back at the options, option D: Homeowner asks about the time to complete. That's just an inquiry, so the offer remains open. So if the homeowner later accepts, it would be effective because the offer wasn't terminated.

Wait, but let me think again. Does option C terminate the offer? If the homeowner asks if they'd do it for $95k, that's a counteroffer, which terminates the original offer. So in that case, the offer is terminated, and a subsequent acceptance wouldn't be possible because the offer was revoked.

So in option D, the inquiry about time doesn't affect the offer. Therefore, the correct answer is D.

To determine which communication does not terminate the contractor's offer, we analyze each option:

- **Option A**: The homeowner deciding to build themselves is a rejection, but rejection does not terminate the offer. The offer remains open unless revoked or lapsed.

- **Option B**: The contractor mentioning increased material costs and needing renegotiation likely terminates the offer, as it indicates a desire to revoke the original terms.

- **Option C**: The homeowner asking if the contractor would build for $95,000 constitutes a counteroffer, which terminates the original offer.

- **Option D**: The homeowner asking about completing the job within six months is merely an inquiry about terms and does not terminate the offer. The offer remains open.

- **Option E**: The contractor's death typically terminates the offer unless the business continues seamlessly, which is unclear here.

- **Option F**: The homeowner finding another contractor for $90,000 is a rejection, but it does not terminate the offer.

- **Option G**: The homeowner "accepting" with a price change of $97,000 is a counteroffer, terminating the original offer.

- **Option H**: The contractor explicitly withdrawing the offer clearly terminates it.

- **Option I**: The contractor increasing the offer to $105,000 revokes the original offer and makes a new one, terminating the original.

- **Option J**: The contractor's bankruptcy likely terminates the offer, as they can no longer perform.

The only communication that does not terminate the offer is **Option D**, as it is a mere inquiry and leaves the offer open for subsequent acceptance.

**Answer: D**
