Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about logical behaviorism and commonsense intuition regarding mental states. Hmm, I remember that behaviorism is a theory in philosophy of mind, right? Logical behaviorism, specifically, I think it's the idea that mental states can be explained entirely through behavior.

The question is about how logical behaviorism contradicts our commonsense intuition about mental states. So, what do I know about this? Commonsense tells us that we have internal mental states like thoughts, feelings, and intentions, and these cause our behaviors. Like, when I decide to pick up a pen, my decision (a mental state) causes the action.

Logical behaviorism, on the other hand, would say that mental states are just a way of describing behavior. So, instead of having a mental state causing behavior, the mental state is equivalent to the behavior. For example, saying someone is angry isn't about an internal feeling but just about the behavior they exhibit, like yelling or hitting things.

So the question is, what does our intuition say that mental states do, which behaviorism would deny? The options are from A to J. Let's look at each option.

Option A: cause behavior. That's the intuition. Commonsense says mental states cause behavior. But behaviorism would say that they don't; instead, the mental state is the behavior. So behaviorism is at odds with this intuition. So the answer would be A.

Wait, let me check other options to be sure. Option B: are the same as behavioral states. That's what behaviorism says, so the intuition would be against that. So the question is about what the intuition says, which is that mental states do cause behavior. So A is correct.

Option C: exist. Commonsense says they exist, behaviorism might argue they don't exist as separate entities. But the question is about the intuition that behaviorism is at odds with. So C is possible, but the question is about the aspect of causing behavior.

Wait, but the question is about what the intuition is. The intuition is that mental states cause behavior, which behaviorism denies. So the answer is that the intuition says mental states cause behavior, which behaviorism is at odds with.

So the correct option is A.

Logical behaviorism is at odds with our commonsense intuition that mental states cause behavior. Commonsense suggests that internal mental states, such as thoughts or intentions, lead to observable actions. In contrast, logical behaviorism posits that mental states are equivalent to behavioral patterns, denying the idea that mental states act as causal agents for behavior. Among the options provided, the intuition that mental states "cause behavior" directly conflicts with behaviorist views, making this the correct choice.

Answer: A
