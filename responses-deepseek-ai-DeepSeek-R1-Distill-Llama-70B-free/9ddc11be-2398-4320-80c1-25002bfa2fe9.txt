Okay, so I have this problem here about a function f that's differentiable on the interval [0, infinity). They told me that f(0) is 0, and for all x >= 0, the absolute value of the derivative f’(x) is less than or equal to the absolute value of f(x). The question is asking for the values of f(2687) and f(35). The options are given from A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, let's think about this step by step. So, f is differentiable, which means it's also continuous in the domain [0, ∞). The condition given is |f’(x)| ≤ |f(x)| for all x ≥ 0, and f(0) is 0.

I remember that differential inequalities can sometimes be approached using integrating factors or by solving differential equations. Since the absolute value is involved, maybe I should consider the possible cases where f’(x) is positive or negative.

Wait, but let's think about the general case. Suppose we have a function where |f’(x)| ≤ |f(x)|. This reminds me of the differential equation f’(x) = k f(x), where |k| ≤ 1. The solution to that is f(x) = C e^{k x}. But since |k| ≤ 1, the function could be growing or decaying exponentially, but within certain bounds.

Oh wait, but since f(0) = 0, let's plug that into the solution. If x is 0, f(0) = C e^{k*0} = C*1 = C. But f(0) is 0, so C must be 0. That would make f(x) = 0 for all x. So does that mean f is identically zero on [0, ∞)?

Wait, but let's check if that's the case. Suppose f is not zero somewhere. Let's assume that there exists some x where f(x) is not zero. Then, because f is differentiable, and the derivative is bounded by |f(x)|, maybe we can use some kind of comparison theorem or Gronwall's inequality.

Alternatively, another approach: Let's square both sides of the inequality. Since |f’(x)| ≤ |f(x)|, squaring gives (f’(x))^2 ≤ (f(x))^2. But I'm not sure if that helps directly. Alternatively, maybe we can consider the function g(x) = |f(x)|. Then, the derivative of g(x) would be f’(x) * sign(f(x)) if f(x) is not zero. But using the given condition, maybe we can bound g’(x).

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to consider the maximum possible growth of f(x). Suppose f(x) is non-zero. Let's take the maximum possible case where |f’(x)| = |f(x)|. Then, the solutions to f’(x) = f(x) would be exponential growth, and f’(x) = -f(x) would be exponential decay. But given that f(0)=0, if we have f’(0) = f(0)=0, so integrating, f(x) remains zero.

Wait that makes sense. Because if f(0)=0, and |f’(x)| ≤ |f(x)|, then f’(0) = 0, because f(0) is zero. Then, locally around zero, the function can't grow because the derivative is zero. So maybe f(x) is zero everywhere.

Let me test this idea. Suppose f is zero at x=0, and the derivative is zero there. Let's pick a small h>0. Since |f’(h)| ≤ |f(h)|, and the function is continuous, maybe near zero f(x) is close to zero. If I consider the Taylor expansion, f(x) ≈ f(0) + f’(0) x + ... which is zero plus zero, so f(x) is zero in some neighborhood around zero. Then, by induction, f(x) remains zero for all x >=0.

Wait, but how about a non-zero function that starts at zero and satisfies |f’(x)| ≤ |f(x)|? For example, f(x) = e^{k x} with |k| ≤1. But if f(0)=0, then C must be zero, so f(x) is zero. So yes, the only solution is f(x) = 0 for all x.

Alternatively, think about the differential inequality |f’(x)| ≤ |f(x)|. This can be rewritten as -|f(x)| ≤ f’(x) ≤ |f(x)|. But since f(0)=0, and the derivative is zero at x=0, perhaps f(x) can't escape from zero.

So, if f is zero everywhere, then f(2687)=0 and f(35)=0. Looking at the options, option H is [0, 0], which would be the correct answer.

Given that \( f \) is differentiable on \([0, +\infty)\) with \( f(0) = 0 \), and the condition \( |f'(x)| \leq |f(x)| \) for all \( x \geq 0 \), we analyze the possible behavior of \( f(x) \).

1. **Initial Condition**: Since \( f(0) = 0 \), we know the function starts at zero.

2. **Differential Inequality**: The condition \( |f'(x)| \leq |f(x)| \) suggests that the growth of \( f(x) \) is bounded by its current value. This is reminiscent of exponential functions, but with \( f(0) = 0 \), any non-zero solution would violate the initial condition.

3. **Uniqueness of Solution**: Considering the differential inequality and the initial condition, the only function that satisfies both is \( f(x) = 0 \) for all \( x \geq 0 \). This is because if \( f(x) \) were non-zero at some point, it would contradict the fact that \( f(0) = 0 \) and the bounded growth rate.

4. **Conclusion**: Since \( f(x) = 0 \) for all \( x \geq 0 \), it follows that \( f(2687) = 0 \) and \( f(35) = 0 \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**H: [0, 0]**
