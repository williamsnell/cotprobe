Okay, so I've got this question about the development of a complex society at Caral in South America. I'm a bit rusty on my ancient civilizations, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Caral is one of the oldest cities in the Americas, located in what's now Peru. It's part of the Norte Chico civilization, if I'm not mistaken. Complex societies usually develop because of certain needs or factors that require organization and hierarchy.

The options given are from A to J. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Construction of canals for irrigation. Irrigation is a big deal because it allows for agriculture, which supports larger populations. But does Caral have evidence of extensive canal systems? I think they might have had some, but was that the main reason for the complex society?

Option B: Creation of a trade network for llama products. Llamas were used more in the Andean highlands, like by the Incas. Caral is on the coast, so maybe they traded fish or other coastal goods. Not sure if llamas were their main trade item.

Option C: Need to collect large quantities of shellfish. Shellfish would have been a food source, but collecting them doesn't necessarily require a complex society. People can gather shellfish in smaller groups.

Option D: The building of the Piramide Mayor. That's a major structure, indicating a complex society. But does the building of the pyramid cause the complexity, or is it a result of it? I think the pyramid is a sign of an already complex society with specialized labor and leaders.

Option E: Centralized defense against invaders. Defense might lead to some organization, but I'm not sure if that's the main driver for Caral. Early complex societies often arise from more economic or religious factors.

Option F: Establish an astronomical observatory. Observatories are part of complex societies, but do they drive the development? Maybe, but I don't recall Caral being known specifically for that.

Option G: Excavating sunken plazas. These are architectural features that require planning and labor, again a result of complexity rather than a cause.

Option H: Development of a hierarchical religious system. Religion often plays a role in organizing large groups. If Caral had a system where religious leaders controlled resources or labor, that could lead to a complex society.

Option I: Requirement for large-scale stone quarries. Quarrying stone on a large scale would require organization, but again, it's more of a result of existing complexity rather than the cause.

Option J: Invention of a complex writing system. Writing systems usually come after a society is already complex, as they're needed for administration. So J is probably not the reason but a symptom.

So, putting it together. The main drivers for complex societies are often economic (like agriculture), social organization (hierarchy), or religion. Caral is known for its early urbanization without pottery, which is interesting. They likely had a system where leaders could organize people for large projects. That points towards a religious or social hierarchy.

I think the correct answer is either A or H. Wait, I remember reading that Caral's economy was based on fishing and agriculture, supported by irrigation. The canals would have required cooperative effort, which leads to a more organized, complex society. So maybe A is the reason.

Wait, but another thought: Caral is noted for its monumental architecture without evidence of writing or pottery. The construction of such buildings would require a centralized authority, possibly religious in nature. So maybe the hierarchical religious system (H) was the cause.

I'm a bit torn between A and H. Another angle: the initial development of complex societies often starts with the need for collective labor for something like irrigation, which then leads to social hierarchies. So A might be the reason. Alternatively, the religious system could have been the driving force.

Wait, another point: Caral is part of the Norte Chico civilization, which had no pottery, which is unusual. Their economy was based on fishing, but they also had agriculture. The presence of large mounds and plazas suggests a high level of organization. So perhaps the religious system was the reason, as these structures were likely ceremonial centers.

So maybe H is the correct answer. But I'm not entirely certain. Another approach: what do experts say about Caral? From what I recall, the development of complex societies in that region is often attributed to the emergence of a religious hierarchy that organized labor for constructing temples and plazas.

Therefore, I think the answer is H: the development of a hierarchical religious system.

The development of a complex society at Caral in South America is believed to be linked to the emergence of a hierarchical religious system. Caral, part of the Norte Chico civilization, is known for its monumental architecture, including pyramids and sunken plazas, which suggest a high level of organization and centralized authority. These structures were likely ceremonial centers, indicating that religious leaders played a significant role in organizing labor and resources. While factors like irrigation (A) and trade (B) may have contributed to the society's growth, they are more likely outcomes of an already complex society rather than the primary driver. The construction of major structures (D, G) and the need for defense (E) also point to existing complexity. However, the hierarchical religious system (H) is the most plausible reason for the initial development of this complexity, as it would have provided the social and organizational framework necessary for such achievements.

Answer: H
