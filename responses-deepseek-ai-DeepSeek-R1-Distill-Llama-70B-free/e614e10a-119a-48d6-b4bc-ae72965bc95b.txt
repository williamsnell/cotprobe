Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says that between 1886 and 2000, on average, there are 8.7 tropical cyclones per year, and out of those, 5.1 become hurricanes. So, each cyclone has a certain probability of becoming a hurricane. They mention that the probability is independent for each cyclone. 

The setup is that in a given year, there are five cyclones. We need to find the probability that at least three of them become hurricanes. The options are from A to J, with some decimal values.

Hmm, okay. So, first, I think I need to find the probability that a single cyclone becomes a hurricane. Since on average, 5.1 out of 8.7 cyclones become hurricanes each year, the probability p for a cyclone becoming a hurricane would be p = 5.1 / 8.7. Let me calculate that. 

Calculating 5.1 divided by 8.7. Let me see, 5.1 ÷ 8.7 equals approximately 0.586. So p ≈ 0.586. Wait, that's one of the answer options (Option A). But wait, that's just the probability for one cyclone. But the question is about five cyclones and at least three becoming hurricanes.

So, this sounds like a binomial probability problem. Because each cyclone is an independent trial with two outcomes: becomes a hurricane (success) or doesn't (failure). We're looking for the probability of having at least three successes in five trials.

The binomial probability formula is P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k), where C(n,k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time.

Since we're looking for at least three hurricanes, that means three, four, or five hurricanes. So, I'll need to calculate the probabilities for k=3, k=4, and k=5, and then sum them up.

Let's get into the calculations. First, let me compute p, which I already have as approximately 0.586, and (1-p) would be 1 - 0.586 = 0.414.

Now, for each k (3,4,5), compute the combination C(5,k), multiply by p^k and (1-p)^(5-k), then sum them all.

Let's start with k=3:
C(5,3) is 10. Because 5 choose 3 is 10. Then, p^3 is (0.586)^3. Let me calculate that. 0.586 * 0.586 is approximately 0.343, then times 0.586 again is about 0.201. (I'll double-check that calculation: 0.586^3. Let me compute it more accurately. 0.586 * 0.586 = 0.343 (exact?), so 0.343 * 0.586. 0.343 * 0.5 is 0.1715, 0.343 * 0.086 is approx 0.0295. Adding them gives 0.201. So yeah, about 0.201.

Then (1-p)^(5-3) is (0.414)^2. 0.414 squared is 0.171. So, for k=3, the probability is 10 * 0.201 * 0.171.

Wait, no. Wait, the formula is C(n,k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k). So for k=3, it's 10 * (0.586)^3 * (0.414)^2.

Wait, I think I messed up the order earlier. Let me recalculate that.

So, (0.586)^3 = 0.586 * 0.586 * 0.586. Let me compute each step:

0.586 * 0.586: Let me compute 586 * 586, then adjust the decimal.

586 * 586: 500*500=250000, 500*86=43,000, 86*500=43,000, 86*86=7,396. So adding up:

250,000 + 43,000 + 43,000 + 7,396 = 343,396. So 586^2 is 343,396, so 0.586^2 is 0.343396. Then, multiply by 0.586 again:

0.343396 * 0.586. Let me compute 343396 * 586, then adjust the decimal places.

But maybe it's easier to approximate. Let's compute 0.343396 * 0.5 = 0.1717, 0.343396 * 0.08 = 0.02747, 0.343396 * 0.006 = 0.00206. Adding those together: 0.1717 + 0.02747 = 0.19917 + 0.00206 = 0.20123. So (0.586)^3 ≈ 0.2012.

Then, (0.414)^2 is 0.414 * 0.414. 400 * 400 is 160,000, but with decimals, 0.4^2 is 0.16, 0.014^2 is small. Alternatively, 0.414 * 0.414 = (0.4 + 0.014)^2 = 0.16 + 2*(0.4)(0.014) + 0.014^2 = 0.16 + 0.0112 + 0.000196 = 0.171396. So approximately 0.1714.

So, P(k=3) = 10 * 0.2012 * 0.1714. Let's compute that: 10 * 0.2012 = 2.012, then multiply by 0.1714.

2.012 * 0.1714. Let me compute 2 * 0.1714 = 0.3428, 0.012 * 0.1714 = 0.0020568. So total is 0.3428 + 0.0020568 ≈ 0.344857. So P(k=3) ≈ 0.3449.

Now, moving on to k=4. C(5,4) is 5. Because 5 choose 4 is 5.

p^4 is (0.586)^4. I already have (0.586)^3 ≈ 0.2012, so multiply by 0.586 again: 0.2012 * 0.586.

Let me compute 0.2 * 0.586 = 0.1172, 0.0012 * 0.586 = 0.0007032. So total is about 0.1172 + 0.0007032 = 0.1179032. So (0.586)^4 ≈ 0.1179.

(1-p)^(5-4) = (0.414)^1 = 0.414.

So, P(k=4) = 5 * 0.1179 * 0.414.

5 * 0.1179 is 0.5895. Multiply by 0.414: 0.5895 * 0.4 is 0.2358, 0.5895 * 0.014 is approximately 0.008263. So total is 0.2358 + 0.008263 = 0.244063. So P(k=4) ≈ 0.2441.

Now, for k=5: C(5,5) is 1.

p^5 is (0.586)^5. I'll compute it as (0.586)^4 * 0.586. We have (0.586)^4 ≈ 0.1179, so 0.1179 * 0.586.

Compute 0.1 * 0.586 = 0.0586, 0.0179 * 0.586: Hmm, 0.01 * 0.586=0.00586, 0.0079 *0.586 is about 0.004627. So 0.00586 + 0.004627 = 0.010487. So total 0.0586 + 0.010487 = 0.069087. So (0.586)^5 ≈ 0.0691.

(1-p)^(5-5) is (0.414)^0 = 1. So P(k=5) = 1 * 0.0691 * 1 = 0.0691.

Now, summing up the probabilities for k=3,4,5:

P(at least 3) = P(3) + P(4) + P(5) = 0.3449 + 0.2441 + 0.0691.

Let me add them step by step.

0.3449 + 0.2441 = 0.589. Then, 0.589 + 0.0691 = 0.6581.

So the total probability is approximately 0.6581.

Looking back at the options, option I is 0.658, so that must be the correct answer.

To solve the problem, we first determine the probability of a single cyclone becoming a hurricane. Given that an average of 5.1 out of 8.7 cyclones become hurricanes, the probability is:

\[
p = \frac{5.1}{8.7} \approx 0.586
\]

This is a binomial probability problem where we are tasked with finding the probability of at least three hurricanes out of five cyclones. The binomial probability formula is:

\[
P(k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
\]

Here, \(n = 5\), \(p = 0.586\), and we calculate \(P(k)\) for \(k = 3, 4, 5\), then sum the results.

### For \(k = 3\):
\[
\binom{5}{3} = 10, \quad p^3 = (0.586)^3 \approx 0.201, \quad (1-p)^2 = (0.414)^2 \approx 0.171
\]
\[
P(3) = 10 \cdot 0.201 \cdot 0.171 \approx 0.3449
\]

### For \(k = 4\):
\[
\binom{5}{4} = 5, \quad p^4 = (0.586)^4 \approx 0.118, \quad (1-p)^1 = 0.414
\]
\[
P(4) = 5 \cdot 0.118 \cdot 0.414 \approx 0.2441
\]

### For \(k = 5\):
\[
\binom{5}{5} = 1, \quad p^5 = (0.586)^5 \approx 0.069, \quad (1-p)^0 = 1
\]
\[
P(5) = 1 \cdot 0.069 \cdot 1 \approx 0.0691
\]

### Total Probability:
\[
P(\text{at least 3}) = P(3) + P(4) + P(5) = 0.3449 + 0.2441 + 0.0691 \approx 0.6581
\]

The closest option to the calculated probability is **0.658**, which corresponds to **Option I**.
