Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here about Drosophila laying eggs. I need to calculate the mean, variance, standard deviation, and standard error for the sample given. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the data is a list of 25 numbers, each representing the number of eggs laid by a female Drosophila in 24 hours. The numbers are: 97, 79, 88, 91, 88, 86, 104, 89, 91, 92, 103, 96, 101, 94, 91, 92, 94, 95, 88, 89, 90, 93, 84, 87, 93.

So part (a) is to find the mean. The mean is calculated by summing all the numbers and then dividing by the number of observations, which is 25 here. Let me add them up.

Let me list them and add step by step:

Start with 97, add 79: 176
Add 88: 264
Add 91: 355
Add another 88: 443
Add 86: 529
Add 104: 633
Add 89: 722
Add 91: 813
Add 92: 905
Add 103: 1008
Add 96: 1104
Add 101: 1205
Add 94: 1299
Add 91: 1390
Add 92: 1482
Add 94: 1576
Add 95: 1671
Add 88: 1759
Add 89: 1848
Add 90: 1938
Add 93: 2031
Add 84: 2115
Add 87: 2202
Add 93: 2295.

Wait, wait, let me check those additions again because it's easy to make a mistake.

Wait, no, that can't be right because 25 samples can't sum to 2295. Let me recount the additions more carefully.

Let me do it in pairs or groups to make it easier.

Group 1: 97 + 79 = 176
Group 2: 88 +91= 179
Group 3: 88 +86=174
Group 4: 104 +89=193
Group 5: 91 +92=183
Group 6: 103 +96=199
Group 7: 101 +94=195
Group 8: 91 +92=183
Group 9: 94 +95=189
Group 10: 88 +89=177
Group 11: 90 +93=183
Group 12: 84 +87=171
Group 13: 93. Wait, wait, I think I'm grouping wrong. Let me count the numbers: 25 numbers, so 12 pairs and one single.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to just add each number step by step.

Let me try adding each number as I go:

Start with 0.

Add 97: 97
Add 79: 176
Add 88: 264
Add 91: 355
Add 88: 443
Add 86: 529
Add 104: 633
Add 89: 722
Add 91: 813
Add 92: 905
Add 103: 1008
Add 96: 1104
Add 101: 1205
Add 94: 1299
Add 91: 1390
Add 92: 1482
Add 94: 1576
Add 95: 1671
Add 88: 1759
Add 89: 1848
Add 90: 1938
Add 93: 2031
Add 84: 2115
Add 87: 2202
Add 93: 2295.

Wait, 25 numbers. So sum is 2295.

Mean is sum divided by 25. So 2295 /25. Let's compute that.

25 * 90 = 2250. So 2295 -2250 =45. So 90 + (45/25) =90 +1.8=91.8. So the mean is 91.8.

Looking at the options, option D (a) is 91.8, option A is 92.3, etc. So (a) should be 91.8.

Now moving to part (b): variance and standard deviation. Variance is the average of the squared differences from the mean. For sample variance, we use n-1 in the denominator. So first, I'll calculate each (x_i - mean)^2, sum them, and divide by 24.

But calculating this manually is time-consuming. Maybe I can approximate.

Wait, the data is 25 numbers, so n=25. Sum of squares will be needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the fastest way is to compute the squared differences.

But let's think: since the mean is 91.8, each number's deviation from the mean is (x -91.8), and then squared.

Let me list each x and calculate (x -91.8)^2.

1. 97: (97-91.8)=5.2 → 5.2²=27.04
2.79: (79-91.8)= -12.8 → (-12.8)^2=163.84
3.88: (88-91.8)= -3.8 →14.44
4.91: (91-91.8)= -0.8 →0.64
5.88: same as 3:14.44
6.86: (86-91.8)= -5.8 →33.64
7.104: 104-91.8=12.2 →148.84
8.89: (89-91.8)= -2.8 →7.84
9.91: same as 4:0.64
10.92: (92-91.8)=0.2 →0.04
11.103: 103-91.8=11.2 →125.44
12.96: 96-91.8=4.2 →17.64
13.101: 101-91.8=9.2 →84.64
14.94: 94-91.8=2.2 →4.84
15.91: same as 4:0.64
16.92: same as 10:0.04
17.94: same as 14:4.84
18.95: 95-91.8=3.2 →10.24
19.88: same as 3:14.44
20.89: same as 8:7.84
21.90: 90-91.8= -1.8 →3.24
22.93: 93-91.8=1.2 →1.44
23.84: same as 6:33.64
24.87: 87-91.8= -4.8 →23.04
25.93: same as 22:1.44

Now, let me list all these squared values:

27.04, 163.84, 14.44, 0.64,14.44,33.64,148.84,7.84,0.64,0.04,125.44,17.64,84.64,4.84,0.64,0.04,4.84,10.24,14.44,7.84,3.24,1.44,33.64,23.04,1.44.

Now, sum all these.

Let me add them step by step.

Start with 0.

Add 27.04 →27.04

+163.84 →190.88

+14.44 →205.32

+0.64 →205.96

+14.44 →220.4

+33.64 →254.04

+148.84 →402.88

+7.84 →410.72

+0.64 →411.36

+0.04 →411.40

+125.44 →536.84

+17.64 →554.48

+84.64 →639.12

+4.84 →643.96

+0.64 →644.60

+0.04 →644.64

+4.84 →649.48

+10.24 →659.72

+14.44 →674.16

+7.84 →682.00

+3.24 →685.24

+1.44 →686.68

+33.64 →720.32

+23.04 →743.36

+1.44 →744.80.

So the sum of squared differences is 744.8.

Now, sample variance is sum/(n-1) =744.8 /24.

Calculating 744.8 /24. Let's see: 24 *30=720. 744.8-720=24.8. 24.8/24 =1.0333. So variance is 30 +1.0333 ≈31.0333.

Wait, wait, 744.8 divided by 24: 24*31=744, so 744.8 is 744 +0.8. So 744 is 24*31, so 744.8 is 31 + 0.8/24 → 31.0333...

So variance is approximately 31.0333.

Standard deviation is the square root of variance. So sqrt(31.0333) ≈ about 5.57.

Wait, sqrt(25)=5, sqrt(30)=5.477, sqrt(31)=5.5678, sqrt(32)=5.6568. So 31.03 is about 5.57.

So variance ≈31.03, standard deviation ≈5.57.

Now, part (c) is the standard error of the mean. Standard error is the standard deviation divided by sqrt(n). So n=25, sqrt(25)=5.

So standard error =5.57 /5 ≈1.114.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option D: (b) variance=31.17, stdev=5.58, standard error=1.11.

Hmm, our calculated variance is 31.03, option D says 31.17, which is close but a bit higher. Maybe I miscalculated the sum of squares.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in adding the squared terms. Let me double-check the sum.

Let me recount the squared differences:

List again:

1. 27.04
2. 163.84
3.14.44
4.0.64
5.14.44
6.33.64
7.148.84
8.7.84
9.0.64
10.0.04
11.125.44
12.17.64
13.84.64
14.4.84
15.0.64
16.0.04
17.4.84
18.10.24
19.14.44
20.7.84
21.3.24
22.1.44
23.33.64
24.23.04
25.1.44.

Wait, let me add them in pairs to make it easier.

Pair 1 and 2: 27.04 +163.84 =190.88

Pair3 and4:14.44 +0.64=15.08 → total 205.96

Pair5 and6:14.44 +33.64=48.08 → total 205.96 +48.08=254.04

Pair7 and8:148.84 +7.84=156.68 →254.04 +156.68=410.72

Pair9 and10:0.64 +0.04=0.68 →411.4

Pair11 and12:125.44 +17.64=143.08 →411.4 +143.08=554.48

Pair13 and14:84.64 +4.84=89.48 →554.48 +89.48=643.96

Pair15 and16:0.64 +0.04=0.68 →644.64

Pair17 and18:4.84 +10.24=15.08 →644.64 +15.08=659.72

Pair19 and20:14.44 +7.84=22.28 →659.72+22.28=682.0

Pair21 and22:3.24 +1.44=4.68 →682.0 +4.68=686.68

Pair23 and24:33.64 +23.04=56.68 →686.68 +56.68=743.36

Plus the last term, 1.44 →743.36 +1.44=744.8.

So the sum is correct, 744.8.

So variance is 744.8 /24 =31.0333...

So 31.03 in variance.

Looking at the options, option D's variance is 31.17, which is a bit higher. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, let me check one more time. Maybe when I calculated each (x-mean)^2, I made a mistake.

Let me pick a few numbers and verify.

For example, x=79: (79 -91.8)= -12.8 → 12.8^2=163.84. That's correct.

x=104: 104-91.8=12.2 →12.2^2=148.84. Correct.

x=93: 93-91.8=1.2 →1.44.

x=84:84-91.8= -7.8? Wait wait, 84 is less than 91.8, so 84-91.8= -7.8 → (-7.8)^2=60.84. Oh wait, earlier I said it was 33.64. Oh no, I think I made a mistake there.

Wait, let's go back to the calculation for x=84.

Wait the 23rd number is 84. So, (84 -91.8) = -7.8 → (-7.8)^2 is 60.84. But earlier I wrote 33.64 for x=84. That's a mistake. Oh wait, I think I confused 84 with another number.

Let me go back to the list of squared differences. The 23rd term is 84. So in the list, the 23rd squared value is 33.64. But that's incorrect. It should be 60.84.

Similarly, for x=93 (25th term), (93-91.8)=1.2 →1.44. That's correct.

So, the error is in the squared value for x=84. I had written 33.64, but it should be 60.84.

So that changes the sum. Let me recalculate the sum of squared differences.

Earlier, the sum was 744.8, but we have an error in the 23rd term. So the correct squared value for x=84 is 60.84, not 33.64.

So in the list, the 23rd term was 33.64. So the correct sum would be:

744.8 (original) -33.64 (wrong) +60.84 (correct) = 744.8 -33.64=711.16 +60.84=772.

Wait, that's a big difference. So the sum should be 772 instead of 744.8.

Wait, but wait, what about the 23rd term? Let me recount.

Wait, the 23rd term in the data is 84, correct? Let me check the data list again.

Yes, the data is:

1.97, 2.79,3.88,4.91,5.88,6.86,7.104,8.89,9.91,10.92,11.103,12.96,13.101,14.94,15.91,16.92,17.94,18.95,19.88,20.89,21.90,22.93,23.84,24.87,25.93.

So yes, the 23rd is 84, which we miscalculated earlier.

So the squared difference for 84 is (84-91.8)= -7.8 →60.84.

So the sum of squared differences is 744.8 -33.64 +60.84=744.8 +27.2=772.0.

So variance is 772.0 /24 =32.1666...

Wait, 772 ÷24: 24 *32=768. 772-768=4 →32 +4/24=32.1666...

So variance is approximately 32.1666...

Wait, but that's different from before. So where did I go wrong earlier? I think I made a mistake in calculating the squared terms for some other data points as well. Maybe I should recheck another term.

Wait, how about x=87 (24th term). (87-91.8)= -4.8 →(-4.8)^2=23.04. That was correct.

x=93 (25th term): 93-91.8=1.2 →1.44. Correct.

Wait, no, the only error was in the 23rd term, right? So the sum should be 772.

So variance is 772 /24=32.166666..., which is approximately 32.17.

Then, standard deviation is the square root of 32.17. Let's calculate that. sqrt(32.17) is approximately 5.67. Because 5.67^2=32.1489, which is about 32.15. So 5.67 is close.

Wait, 5.67^2=32.1489, 5.67^2= approx 32.15.

So variance is 32.17, standard deviation is ~5.67.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D says variance 31.17, stdev 5.58. So perhaps I made another mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made another error in the squared terms. Let me check another term.

Looking back, when I calculated x=86, which is the 6th term. 86-91.8= -5.8 →33.64. Correct.

What about x=95 (18th term): 95-91.8=3.2 →10.24. Correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the 24th term, x=87.
