Okay, so I've got this question about Erik Erikson's theory of psychosocial development. I remember that Erikson proposed eight stages, each with a specific conflict or challenge that a person must face. The question is about someone looking back at their life with regrets and a sense of unfulfillment. I need to figure out which stage that relates to.

Let me think about each stage. The first one is trust versus mistrust during infancy. If a baby doesn't develop trust, they might have issues later, but that's not about looking back at life's end. Next is autonomy versus shame and doubt, which is toddlerhood. That's about exploring and making choices safely. Then initiative versus guilt in early childhood, where kids take on responsibilities. Industry versus inferiority comes next, around elementary school age, dealing with competence.

The fifth stage is identity versus role confusion, which is during adolescence. Teens explore who they are and their place in the world. If they don't resolve this, they might feel confused about their identity. Then comes intimacy versus isolation in young adulthood. People seek meaningful relationships here. If they fail, they might feel isolated.

The seventh stage is generativity versus stagnation in middle adulthood. Generativity is about contributing to society, raising a family, or creating something that will outlast them. If someone doesn't feel they've made a meaningful contribution, they might stagnate, feeling unproductive.

The eighth and final stage is integrity versus despair. This is in late adulthood. People reflect on their lives. If they feel satisfied with their accomplishments, they achieve integrity. But if they have regrets and feel unfulfilled, it's because they didn't successfully resolve this stage. They might despair, thinking about what they could have done differently.

So the question says the person feels their life lacked fulfillment. That sounds like the integrity versus despair stage. They're looking back and seeing regrets, so they didn't achieve integrity. Therefore, the correct answer should relate to that stage.

The question asks which of Erikson's psychosocial stages is associated with individuals who look back on their lives with regret and a sense of unfulfillment. Erikson's eighth stage, **integrity versus despair**, occurs in late adulthood, where individuals reflect on their lives. If they feel satisfied with their accomplishments, they achieve integrity. However, if they experience regret and a lack of fulfillment, it indicates unresolved despair from this stage.
