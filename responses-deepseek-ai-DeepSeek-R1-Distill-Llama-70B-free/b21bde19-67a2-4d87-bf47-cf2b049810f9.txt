Okay, so I've got this legal question here about mortgages, deeds, and liability. I'm a bit rusty on property law, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, let's break down the facts. There are four events listed in order:

1. In 1993, a woman mortgages land to a mortgage company for $25k, due Dec 31, 1993, with 9.5% interest.
2. In 1996, the mortgage company records the mortgage.
3. In 2007, the woman signs a writing delivered to her daughter, promising to convey the land via quitclaim deed and pay the mortgage debt when due.
4. In 2008, the woman gives the daughter a quitclaim deed that doesn't mention the mortgage.

Now, the woman defaults on the mortgage debt. The question is about who has a cause of action against whom.

First, let's recall some key concepts. A mortgage is a lien on the property. When a grantor (here, the woman) mortgages property, the mortgagee (mortgage company) has a right to the property as security. If the grantor defaults, the mortgagee can foreclose.

A quitclaim deed transfers whatever interest the grantor has but doesn't guarantee anything about that interest. So when the woman gave the quitclaim deed to her daughter, she transferred her interest as of that point. But if there's a mortgage, the daughter takes the property subject to that mortgage, unless the mortgage is paid off.

Wait, but the woman promised in 2007 to pay the mortgage debt when it came due. So she made a contractual promise to her daughter. Then in 2008, she delivered the deed without mentioning the mortgage. So the daughter now owns the land, but with the mortgage still attached, right?

If the woman defaults on the mortgage, the mortgage company can foreclose. But what about the daughter's liability? Because the mortgage was recorded in 1996, which is before the daughter got the deed in 2008. So the daughter takes the property subject to the mortgage.

But the woman also promised to pay the mortgage debt. So if the woman defaults, the mortgage company can go after her, right? Because she's the one who took the loan. The daughter didn't assume the mortgage, I think. Because the deed didn't mention it. So the daughter isn't personally liable for the mortgage debt. She just holds the property subject to the mortgage.

Wait, but in the 2007 agreement, the woman promised to pay the debt. So if she defaults, can the daughter sue her for breaching that promise? Because the daughter might have relied on that promise when accepting the deed.

So the daughter might have a cause of action against the woman for breach of contract. Because the woman didn't pay the mortgage as promised, causing the daughter to potentially lose the property or have to pay it herself.

On the other hand, the mortgage company can still go after the woman because she's the mortgagor. The mortgage is still in effect, and her default means the mortgage company can enforce the lien against the property, which is now owned by the daughter. But the mortgage company probably can't go after the daughter personally because she didn't assume the debt.

Wait, but if the mortgage company forecloses, the daughter would lose the property, but she might have a claim against her mother for the loss because the mother didn't fulfill her promise to pay the mortgage. So the daughter could sue the mother for damages resulting from the foreclosure.

Looking at the options:

A: The mortgage company has a cause of action against both the woman and the daughter.

Wait, can the mortgage company go after the daughter? I don't think so, because the daughter didn't take on the mortgage debt. Unless the daughter explicitly assumed it, which she didn't. The quitclaim deed didn't mention it. So the mortgage company can only go after the woman.

B: The daughter has a cause of action against the mortgage company.

I don't see why. The mortgage company is just enforcing their rights against the property, which the daughter holds subject to the mortgage. So perhaps the daughter can't sue the mortgage company.

C: Neither the daughter nor the mortgage company has a cause of action against the woman.

No, that's not right. The mortgage company does have a cause of action against the woman because she defaulted on the mortgage.

D: Only the mortgage company has a cause of action against the woman.

But what about the daughter? The woman promised to pay the mortgage, so the daughter might have a cause of action against her for breach of contract.

E: Both the daughter and the mortgage company have causes of action against the woman.

Yes, that sounds right. The mortgage company can sue the woman for the debt, and the daughter can sue her for breaching the 2007 promise to pay the mortgage.

F: The woman has a cause of action against the mortgage company.

I don't think so. The mortgage company is just enforcing their rights.

G: The mortgage company and the daughter share a cause of action against the woman.

I'm not sure if they 'share' it; each has their own separate claims. So maybe G is not the best choice.

H: Only the daughter has a cause of action against the woman.

No, because the mortgage company also has a cause of action.

I: Both the woman and the daughter have causes of action against the mortgage company.

No, the woman is the mortgagor; the mortgage company is acting properly.

J: The woman has a cause of action against the daughter.

I don't see why; the daughter didn't do anything wrong.

So looking back, option E says both the daughter and the mortgage company have causes of action against the woman. That seems correct because the mortgage company can enforce the mortgage debt against her, and the daughter can sue for breach of the 2007 agreement.

In this scenario, the woman mortgaged the property in 1993, and the mortgage was recorded in 1996, giving the mortgage company a valid lien on the property. In 2007, the woman promised her daughter in writing to convey the property via quitclaim deed and pay the mortgage debt when due. In 2008, she delivered the quitclaim deed, which transferred her interest in the property to the daughter without referencing the mortgage. The daughter therefore took the property subject to the existing mortgage. When the woman defaulted on the mortgage, the mortgage company, as the mortgagee, has a cause of action against the woman to enforce the mortgage lien.

Additionally, the woman’s 2007 promise to pay the mortgage debt constitutes a contractual obligation to her daughter. By failing to pay the mortgage as promised, the woman breached this contract, giving the daughter a cause of action against her for breach of contract.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The mortgage company cannot have a cause of action against the daughter because she did not assume the mortgage debt.
- **B**: Incorrect. The daughter has no cause of action against the mortgage company, as the mortgage company is simply enforcing its rights under the mortgage.
- **C**: Incorrect. Both the mortgage company and the daughter have causes of action against the woman.
- **D**: Incorrect. While the mortgage company has a cause of action against the woman, so does the daughter due to the breach of the 2007 agreement.
- **E**: Correct. The mortgage company can enforce the mortgage lien against the woman, and the daughter can sue the woman for breaching her promise to pay the mortgage debt.
- **F**: Incorrect. The woman has no cause of action against the mortgage company, as the mortgage company is acting within its rights.
- **G**: Incorrect. While both the mortgage company and the daughter have causes of action against the woman, their claims are separate and not shared.
- **H**: Incorrect. Only the daughter having a cause of action against the woman ignores the mortgage company’s valid claim.
- **I**: Incorrect. Neither the woman nor the daughter has a cause of action against the mortgage company.
- **J**: Incorrect. The woman has no cause of action against the daughter.

Thus, the correct answer is **E**: Both the daughter and the mortgage company have causes of action against the woman.

**Answer: E**
