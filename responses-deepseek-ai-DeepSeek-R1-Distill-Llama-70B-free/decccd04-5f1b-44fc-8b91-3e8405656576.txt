Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a spring-mass-dashpot system. Hmm, I remember that these kinds of problems involve oscillations and damping. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem says that a spring is stretched 6 inches by a mass that weighs 8 lb. Wait, weight is mass times gravity. Oh right, so weight in pounds is mass in slugs multiplied by 32 ft/s². So the mass m is weight divided by 32. So 8 lb would mean m = 8 / 32 = 0.25 slugs. Okay, but wait, the question is about replacing this mass with another mass m, and we need to find m for which the amplitude is maximum.

The dashpot has a damping constant of 0.25 lb·s/ft. Oh right, damping force is proportional to velocity, so F = b * velocity. The damping coefficient is b = 0.25 here.

There's also an external force of 4 cos(2t) lb. So this is a harmonic external force. The system is under forced vibrations.

I think the amplitude of the steady-state response in a forced vibration depends on the frequency of the external force relative to the natural frequency of the system. The amplitude is maximum when the frequency of the external force is equal to the natural frequency of the system. Wait, but isn't that only when the damping is low? Or maybe in resonance condition?

Wait, no, resonance in a damped system occurs when the frequency of the external force equals the damped natural frequency. Or wait, the maximum amplitude occurs when the frequency ratio is such that... Oh right, I think the maximum amplitude occurs when the denominator of the amplitude expression is minimized. The formula for the amplitude in forced damped motion is (F0 / k) * 1 / sqrt( (1 - (ω²/ωn²))² + (2βω/ωn)² ), where β is the damping ratio. So the maximum happens when the denominator is smallest.

Alternatively, the maximum amplitude can be found when the derivative of the amplitude squared with respect to ω is zero. But I'm getting a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe the maximum occurs when the forcing frequency equals the natural frequency, but I'm not sure because of damping.

Wait, in a damped system, the peak of the frequency response curve doesn't occur exactly at the natural frequency. It's shifted a bit. But I think for the purposes of this problem, especially if damping is relatively small, perhaps resonance is near the natural frequency. Alternatively, I remember that the peak amplitude occurs when the magnitude of the impedance is minimized, which in turn happens when the denominator is minimized, which would correspond to when the system's frequency matches the forcing frequency. Hmm.

Wait, the system's natural frequency is sqrt(k/m). But wait, in this problem, the spring constant k isn't given yet. Oh wait, the spring is stretched 6 inches by the mass. So using Hooke's law, F = kx. The mass is 8 lb, which gives F = 8 lb, x = 6 inches which is 0.5 feet. So k = F/x = 8 lb / 0.5 ft = 16 lb/ft. So k is 16 lb/ft.

But wait, the original mass is 8 lb weight, which is m_initial = 8 / 32 = 0.25 slugs. But this system is being replaced by a mass m, so the new mass is m, and we're to find m for which the amplitude is maximum.

The external force is 4 cos(2t). So the forcing frequency ω is 2 rad/s.

Wait, I think the natural frequency of the system when mass is m would be ωn = sqrt(k/m). So the natural frequency for the new system is sqrt(16/m).

The amplitude of the steady-state response is given by X = (F0 / k) * 1 / sqrt( (1 - (ω/ωn)^2 )^2 + (2 ζ (ω/ωn) )^2 ), where ζ is the damping ratio. The damping ratio ζ is c/(2 m ωn), where c is the damping coefficient. Oh wait, c is given as 0.25 lb·s/ft. So ζ = (0.25) / (2 m ωn) ).

But the maximum amplitude occurs when the denominator is minimized. Let me think: when is the denominator sqrt( (1 - (ω/ωn)^2 )^2 + (2 ζ (ω/ωn) )^2 ) the smallest? That would make X the largest.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the formula for X.

Wait, let me write the expression for X.

X = (F0/k) * 1 / sqrt( (ωn² - ω²)^2 + (2 c ω)^2 ) / (ωn² * k²) )

Wait, perhaps I should rederive it more accurately.

Wait, the standard formula is:

The amplitude X is given by (F0 / k) * 1 / sqrt( (1 - (ω/ωn)^2 )^2 + (2 ζ (ω/ωn) )^2 )

Wait, yes, because ζ is c/(2 m ωn), and in the expression, the denominator involves the damping term.

So to maximize X, we need to minimize the denominator.

So let me represent this denominator as D = sqrt( (1 - (ω/ωn)^2 )^2 + (2 ζ (ω/ωn) )^2 )

We need to find the value of m that makes D as small as possible, given ω, which is 2 rad/s.

But wait, ωn is sqrt(k/m), so ωn = sqrt(16/m) = 4 / sqrt(m). Because k is 16 lb/ft.

So ωn = 4 / sqrt(m). So (ω/ωn) = (2) / (4 / sqrt(m)) ) = (2 * sqrt(m)) /4 = sqrt(m)/2.

So let's let r = ω/ωn = sqrt(m)/2. Then, the denominator D becomes sqrt( (1 - r^2)^2 + (2 ζ r )^2 ). We need to find r such that D is minimized, but m is what we're solving for, so we'll have to express everything in terms of m.

But wait, ζ is c/(2 m ωn). Let's compute ζ.

c is 0.25 lb·s/ft. m is the mass in slugs, and ωn is 4/sqrt(m) rad/s.

So ζ = c/(2 m ωn) ) = 0.25 / (2 m * (4 / sqrt(m)) ) ) = 0.25 / (8 m^(1) / m^(1/2)) ) 

Wait, m * (4/sqrt(m)) = 4 m^(1 - 0.5) ) = 4 m^0.5. So denominator is 8 m^(1) / m^(0.5) )=8 m^0.5.

Wait, wait, let me compute denominator correctly.

Denominator inside ζ: 2 m ωn = 2 * m * (4 / sqrt(m)) ) = 8 m / sqrt(m) = 8 m^(1 - 0.5) ) = 8 m^0.5.

So ζ = 0.25 / (8 m^0.5 ) ) = (0.25 /8 ) * 1/m^0.5 = (1/32) / m^0.5.

So ζ = 1/(32 m^0.5 ) = 1/(32 sqrt(m)).

Now, substitute into the denominator D.

D = sqrt( (1 - r^2)^2 + (2 ζ r )^2 ), where r = sqrt(m)/2.

So substituting r and ζ:

(1 - r^2) = 1 - (m/4 )

(2 ζ r ) = 2 * [1/(32 sqrt(m))] * [sqrt(m)/2 ].

Wait, let's compute that.

Compute 2 ζ r:

ζ is 1/(32 sqrt(m)), r is sqrt(m)/2.

So 2 * (1/(32 sqrt(m))) ) * (sqrt(m)/2 ) ) = 2 * (1/(32 sqrt(m)) * sqrt(m)/2 ) )

The sqrt(m) cancels, 2 and 2 cancel, so we have 1/(32 * 1) ) = 1/32.

So the second term is (1/32)^2 = 1/1024.

So D becomes sqrt( (1 - m/4)^2 + (1/32)^2 )

Wait, wait, because (2 ζ r) is 1/32, so when squared, it's 1/1024.

Wait, but (1 - m/4) is squared, so the first term is (1 - m/4)^2.

So D = sqrt( (1 - m/4)^2 + (1/32)^2 )

Wait, but we're looking for the value of m that makes D minimal.

So the denominator D is sqrt( (1 - m/4)^2 + (1/32)^2 )

To minimize D, we need to minimize the expression under the square root, which is (1 - m/4)^2 + (1/32)^2.

Since (1/32)^2 is a constant, the minimum occurs when (1 - m/4)^2 is as small as possible, which is zero. So set 1 - m/4 =0 → m=4.

Wait, that would make (1 - m/4)=0, so the first term is zero. Then D would be sqrt(0 + (1/32)^2 ) = 1/32. Which is the minimal possible D.

Wait, but wait, that's only if when m=4, the system is such that r= sqrt(4)/2 = 2/2=1. So r=1, which is when the frequency ratio is 1, meaning resonant condition. But wait, earlier calculation shows that when m=4, the denominator D is minimized, making X maximum.

But wait, I thought that in damped systems, the peak isn't exactly at resonance, but perhaps this is a special case where the peak is exactly at resonance.

Wait, but according to our calculation, the minimal D occurs when m=4, regardless of the damping, because the (1 - m/4) term disappears. But that doesn't seem right because if there's damping, the maximum should be near resonance, but not exactly.

Wait, but in this particular setup, when we substituted everything, the second term in the denominator ended up being a constant (1/1024), and the first term became dependent on m. So when m=4, the first term is zero, making D as small as possible, hence X as large as possible.

But wait, let me go back to the substitution.

Wait, when I computed 2 ζ r, I thought it became 1/32. So, (2 ζ r)^2 is 1/1024.

But wait, was that correct?

Because ζ = 1/(32 sqrt(m)).

r = sqrt(m)/2.

So 2 ζ r = 2 * (1/(32 sqrt(m))) ) * (sqrt(m)/2 )

The 2 and 2 in the numerator and denominator cancel, leaving (1/(32 sqrt(m))) * sqrt(m) ) = 1/32.

So yes, indeed, (2 ζ r ) = 1/32.

So the second term in the denominator is (1/32)^2 = 1/1024.

Therefore, the expression under the square root is (1 - m/4)^2 + (1/32)^2.

To minimize this, we set 1 - m/4 =0 → m=4.

So the maximum amplitude occurs when m=4 slugs.

Looking back at the options, option F is 4 slugs.

To determine the value of \( m \) for which the amplitude of the steady-state response is maximum, we analyze the forced vibration of the spring-mass-dashpot system. The system parameters are as follows:

- The spring constant \( k \) is calculated using Hooke's law: \( k = \frac{F}{x} = \frac{8 \, \text{lb}}{0.5 \, \text{ft}} = 16 \, \text{lb/ft} \).
- The damping constant \( c \) is given as \( 0.25 \, \text{lb·s/ft} \).
- The external force is \( F(t) = 4 \cos(2t) \, \text{lb} \), so the forcing frequency is \( \omega = 2 \, \text{rad/s} \).

The amplitude \( X \) of the steady-state response is given by:

\[
X = \frac{F_0 / k}{\sqrt{\left(1 - \frac{\omega^2}{\omega_n^2}\right)^2 + \left(2 \zeta \frac{\omega}{\omega_n}\right)^2}}
\]

where \( \omega_n = \sqrt{k / m} \) is the natural frequency of the system, and \( \zeta = \frac{c}{2 m \omega_n} \) is the damping ratio. The amplitude is maximized when the denominator of this expression is minimized.

### Step 1: Express \( \omega_n \) and \( \zeta \) in terms of \( m \)
- The natural frequency is \( \omega_n = \sqrt{k / m} = \sqrt{16 / m} = 4 / \sqrt{m} \).
- The damping ratio is \( \zeta = \frac{c}{2 m \omega_n} = \frac{0.25}{2 m (4 / \sqrt{m})} = \frac{0.25}{8 \sqrt{m}} = \frac{1}{32 \sqrt{m}} \).

### Step 2: Simplify the denominator
The denominator of the amplitude expression is:

\[
D = \sqrt{\left(1 - \frac{\omega^2}{\omega_n^2}\right)^2 + \left(2 \zeta \frac{\omega}{\omega_n}\right)^2}
\]

Substituting \( \omega_n = 4 / \sqrt{m} \) and \( \zeta = 1 / (32 \sqrt{m}) \), we compute:

- \( \frac{\omega}{\omega_n} = \frac{2}{4 / \sqrt{m}} = \frac{\sqrt{m}}{2} \).
- \( 1 - \frac{\omega^2}{\omega_n^2} = 1 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{m}}{2}\right)^2 = 1 - \frac{m}{4} \).
- \( 2 \zeta \frac{\omega}{\omega_n} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{32 \sqrt{m}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{m}}{2} = \frac{1}{32} \).

Thus, the denominator becomes:

\[
D = \sqrt{\left(1 - \frac{m}{4}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{32}\right)^2}
\]

### Step 3: Minimize \( D \)
To maximize the amplitude, \( D \) must be minimized. Since \( \left(\frac{1}{32}\right)^2 \) is a constant, the term \( \left(1 - \frac{m}{4}\right)^2 \) must be minimized. This occurs when:

\[
1 - \frac{m}{4} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad m = 4 \, \text{slugs}
\]

### Conclusion
The amplitude of the steady-state response is maximized when the mass \( m \) is \( 4 \, \text{slugs} \). This corresponds to option **F**.
