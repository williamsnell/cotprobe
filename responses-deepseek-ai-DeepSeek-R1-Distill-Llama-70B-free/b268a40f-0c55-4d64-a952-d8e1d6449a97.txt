Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a straight wire carrying a current. Hmm, the question is asking for the total power entering a unit length of the wire. Alright, let me think about what I remember from my studies.

So, the wire is along the Z-axis and has a radius r_0. The current is steady, so it's DC, I think. Power in a wire... I remember that power is related to current and resistance. Oh right, the formula P = I² R, where I is the current and R is the resistance. That makes sense because higher current or higher resistance would mean more power.

Wait, but the question is about a unit length of the wire. So I need to find the power per unit length. So maybe I should think about the resistivity and the geometry of the wire.

The resistance R of a wire is given by R = ρ (L/A), where ρ is the resistivity, L is the length, and A is the cross-sectional area. But since we're looking for power per unit length, L would be 1, so R for unit length is ρ / A.

The cross-sectional area A of the wire is π r_0², right? Because the wire is cylindrical. So substituting that in, R = ρ / (π r_0²).

Now, plugging R into the power formula: P = I² * R. Since R is ρ / (π r_0²), then P = I² * (ρ / (π r_0²)).

Wait, but I don't see ρ in the answer options. Oh, maybe I should express the resistivity in terms of something else. Alternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, another approach: Ohm's law is J = σ E, where J is current density, σ is conductivity, and E is electric field. But maybe that's complicating things. Let me think again.

Wait, resistance per unit length is R = ρ/(π r_0²). So the power per unit length would be P = I² R, which is I² * (ρ/(π r_0²)).

But none of the answer options have ρ in them. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps the question is considering the power dissipated in the wire, which would be the same as the power entering it, assuming steady current.

Wait, the options given are E: I² R, H: I²/R, etc. So perhaps I need to express R in terms of the given variables. Let me see.

Wait, the options have R as a variable. So maybe R is the resistance per unit length. So R = ρ/(π r_0²). Then, the power per unit length is P = I² R.

Looking at the options, E is I² R, which would be correct if R is the resistance per unit length. So the answer would be E.

But wait, let me double-check. The power is P = I² R, and R here is per unit length. So yeah, E is the option.

To determine the total power entering a unit length of a straight wire carrying a steady current \( I \), we start with the formula for power dissipated in a resistor: 

\[
P = I^2 R
\]

Here, \( R \) is the resistance of the wire. For a unit length of the wire, the resistance \( R \) can be expressed in terms of the wire's resistivity \( \rho \) and its cross-sectional area \( A \). The cross-sectional area of the wire is:

\[
A = \pi r_0^2
\]

Thus, the resistance per unit length is:

\[
R = \frac{\rho}{A} = \frac{\rho}{\pi r_0^2}
\]

Substituting this into the power formula, the power per unit length becomes:

\[
P = I^2 \cdot R = I^2 \cdot \frac{\rho}{\pi r_0^2}
\]

However, none of the answer options explicitly include \( \rho \). This suggests that \( R \) in the answer options is already interpreted as the resistance per unit length. Therefore, the power per unit length simplifies to:

\[
P = I^2 R
\]

From the given options, the correct one that matches this expression is:

**E: \( I^2 R \)**.

Answer: E
