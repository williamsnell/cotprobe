Question:

What is a One-to-One Assembler?

Options:

A: A One-to-One assembler translates each line of a machine word into an assembler language program
B: A One-to-One assembler translates two lines of an assembler language program into two machine words during assembly
C: A One-to-One assembler translates each line of an assembler language program into multiple machine words
D: A One-to-One assembler translates each line of an assembler language program into one machine word during assembly
E: A One-to-One assembler translates each machine word into multiple lines of an assembler language program
F: A One-to-One assembler requires manual intervention for each line of assembly to machine code translation
G: A One-to-One assembler compiles entire assembler language programs into a single executable machine word
H: A One-to-One assembler generates one line of machine code for every two lines of assembler language program
I: A One-to-One assembler translates each line of an assembler language program into a corresponding line in a high-level programming language
J: A One-to-One assembler translates multiple lines of an assembler language program into a single machine word

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about One-to-One Assemblers. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my assembly language concepts, but let's try to think it through.

First, I remember that assemblers translate assembler code into machine code. There are different types of assemblers, like one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-one. Wait, no, maybe it's more about how each line translates. Oh right, I think a one-to-one assembler means that each line of assembly code corresponds to exactly one machine instruction. So each line in the source code becomes a single machine code instruction.

Looking at the options:

Option A says each line of machine word is translated into assembler. That sounds backwards because assemblers go from assembly to machine code, not the other way around. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: Translates two lines of assembler into two machine words. Well, that would imply a two-to-one ratio, but the question is about one-to-one. So B is not right.

Option C: Each line of assembler becomes multiple machine words. That doesn't fit one-to-one. Maybe that's a one-to-many assembler. So C is out.

Option D: Each line becomes one machine word. That aligns with what I was thinking earlier. Each line of assembly code results in one machine instruction. So D seems correct.

Option E: Translates machine word into multiple lines of assembler. Again, that's the reverse process, so probably not.

Option F: Manual intervention for each line. I don't think that's what one-to-one means. Assemblers are supposed to automate this process, so F doesn't fit.

Option G: Compiles entire programs into a single machine word. That doesn't make sense because a program is usually multiple instructions. So G is unlikely.

Option H: One line of machine code for every two lines of assembler. That would be a two-to-one ratio, not one-to-one. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Translates to a high-level language line. That's not the job of an assembler; maybe a disassembler or something else. So I is wrong.

Option J: Multiple lines into one machine word. That's a many-to-one scenario, like a macro assembler perhaps. But the question is about one-to-one, so J is incorrect.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be D: Each line translates into one machine word during assembly.

The correct answer is D because a One-to-One Assembler translates each line of an assembler language program into one machine word during assembly.

D
