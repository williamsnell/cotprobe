Okay, so I've got this question about Euler circuits in undirected graphs. Hmm, I remember that an Euler circuit is a path that uses every edge exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. Oh right, Euler circuits are also called Eulerian circuits sometimes.

The question asks which of the given graphs must have an Euler circuit. The options are I, II, III, and then various combinations. Let me think about each one.

First, I need to recall the conditions for an undirected graph to have an Euler circuit. I think it's two main things: the graph must be connected, and every vertex must have an even degree. Because if all vertices have even degrees, then it's possible to traverse each edge exactly once and end up where you started.

So, let's look at each case.

I. A complete graph with 12 vertices. Complete graphs have every pair of vertices connected by an edge. So for a complete graph with n vertices, each vertex has degree (n-1). So for 12 vertices, each has degree 11. Wait, 11 is an odd number. So each vertex has odd degree. But for an Euler circuit, all must be even. So I think this graph doesn't have an Euler circuit because all vertices have odd degrees.

Wait wait, but wait a second. Wait, no. Wait, in a complete graph with an even number of vertices, is the degree even or odd? Let's see. For n vertices, each has degree n-1. So if n is even, then n-1 is odd. Oh, so for a complete graph with an even number of vertices, each vertex has odd degree. So if n is even, then the complete graph has all vertices of odd degree. So for I, n=12, so each vertex has degree 11, which is odd. So all degrees are odd. So it doesn't satisfy the condition for an Euler circuit. Because Euler requires all even degrees.

Wait, but wait, does the graph have an Euler circuit or trail? Oh right, an Euler trail is when exactly two vertices have odd degrees, allowing you to start and end at those. But the question is about a circuit, which requires all even.

So I. Complete graph with 12 vertices: all degrees odd. So no Euler circuit. So I doesn't have it.

II. Complete graph with 13 vertices. n=13. Each vertex has degree 12, which is even. So all degrees even, and the graph is connected. So yes, it has an Euler circuit.

III. A tree with 13 vertices. Oh wait, trees are connected by definition, but they have no cycles. Wait, but for Euler circuits, the graph needs to be connected and all vertices have even degrees. Wait, but in a tree, all vertices except the leaves have degrees, but trees have a lot of leaves. Wait, a tree with n vertices has n-1 edges. So in a tree, leaves have degree 1, which is odd. So how many leaves does a tree have? Well, in a tree, the number of leaves is at least two, right? Because a tree is a connected acyclic graph, so it must have at least two leaves.

Wait, so a tree with 13 vertices would have several leaves, each with degree 1 (odd). So the degrees are a mix of even and odd. Wait, but for an Euler circuit, all vertices must have even degrees. So a tree can't have an Euler circuit because it has multiple (at least two) vertices with odd degrees, and even if it had exactly two, that would allow an Euler trail, not a circuit. So since a tree is connected but has leaves, which are odd degrees, it can't have an Euler circuit.

So putting it all together:

I: No (all degrees 11, which is odd)
II: Yes (all degrees 12, even)
III: No (has leaves with degree 1, odd)

So the question is which of the graphs must have an Euler circuit. Only II does.

Looking at the options:

Options are:

A: Complete graph with 11 vertices. So n=11, each degree 10, which is even. So yes, it would have an Euler circuit. But the question is about the given options I, II, III, not option A.

Wait, the question is numbered I, II, III. The options A through J are about including I, II, III.

So among I, II, III, only II has an Euler circuit.

Looking at the choices:

Which options say II only? Let's see the choices.

Looking at the options:

A: A complete graph with 11 vertices. Not part of the question but option A is about it. So the question is about which of I, II, III must have.

Wait the question asks which of the following graphs must have an Euler circuit. The graphs are I, II, III. So the options are A-J, which are combinations.

So the correct answer would be the option that includes only II.

Looking at the options, option H is "II only." So the correct answer is H.

But wait, let me double-check. Did I miss anything?

Option II is a complete graph with 13 vertices. n=13, each vertex degree is 12, which is even. So yes, connected and all even degrees. So II has an Euler circuit.

I: n=12, degree 11 (odd). So no.

III: tree with 13. Trees have leaves, which have degree 1 (odd). So no.

So only II is correct. So the correct option is H: II only.

To determine which of the given undirected graphs must have an Euler circuit, we recall the necessary conditions for an Euler circuit: the graph must be connected, and all vertices must have even degrees.

### Analysis of Each Case:

1. **I. A complete graph with 12 vertices**  
   In a complete graph with \( n \) vertices, each vertex has degree \( n-1 \). For \( n = 12 \), each vertex has degree \( 11 \), which is odd. Since all vertices must have even degrees for an Euler circuit, this graph does not have an Euler circuit.

2. **II. A complete graph with 13 vertices**  
   For \( n = 13 \), each vertex has degree \( 12 \), which is even. Additionally, the graph is connected. Since all vertices have even degrees and the graph is connected, this graph has an Euler circuit.

3. **III. A tree with 13 vertices**  
   A tree is a connected acyclic graph. In a tree with \( n \) vertices, there are \( n-1 \) edges, and the number of leaves (vertices with degree 1) is at least 2. Since leaves have odd degrees, a tree cannot satisfy the condition that all vertices have even degrees. Therefore, this graph does not have an Euler circuit.

### Conclusion:
Among the given graphs, only **II** (a complete graph with 13 vertices) satisfies the conditions for an Euler circuit. Thus, the correct answer is:

**H: II only**
