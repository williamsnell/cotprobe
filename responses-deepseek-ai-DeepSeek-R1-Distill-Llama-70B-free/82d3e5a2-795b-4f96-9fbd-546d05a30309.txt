Okay, so I need to find the maximum distance of Halley's comet from the sun. The question gives me some parameters about its orbit, which is an ellipse with the sun at one focus. Let me jot down the given information:

- Eccentricity (e) = 0.97
- Major axis length = 36.18 AU
- The orbit is an ellipse, so the standard polar form should apply here.

Wait, I remember that for an ellipse with one focus at the origin (which is the sun in this case), the polar equation is r = (a*(1-e²))/(1 + e*cosθ), where 'a' is the semi-major axis. Oh wait, wait, no, actually, the formula is r = (ed)/(1 + e*cosθ), where ed is the directrix or something else. Hmm, maybe I should think this through more carefully.

Wait, no, I think the correct polar form when one focus is at the origin is r = (a*(1-e²))/(1 + e cosθ). Because I remember that for an ellipse, the semi-major axis is related to the distance from the center to the focus. But in polar coordinates, when you have one focus at the origin, the equation uses the semi-latus rectum, I think.

Wait, the standard form might be r = (l) / (1 + e cosθ), where l is the semi-latus rectum. And l is given by l = a*(1-e²). Oh, right, that's correct. So putting that together, r = (a*(1-e²)) / (1 + e cosθ).

So I need to find 'a' first. The major axis length is given as 36.18 AU, so the semi-major axis is half of that, so a = 36.18 / 2 = 18.09 AU.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the major axis is 2a, so yes, a is 18.09 AU. So l = a*(1 - e²). Let me compute that.

e is 0.97. So e squared is 0.9409. So 1 - e² is 1 - 0.9409 = 0.0591. Then l = 18.09 * 0.0591 = Let me compute that.

18 * 0.0591 is about 1.0638, and 0.09 * 0.0591 is approximately 0.0053. So adding those together, approximately 1.0638 + 0.0053 = 1.0691 AU. Wait, let me do it more accurately:

18.09 * 0.0591 = Let's calculate 18 * 0.0591 = 1.0638. Then 0.09 * 0.0591 = 0.005319. So total is 1.0638 + 0.005319 = 1.069119 AU. So l is approximately 1.0691 AU.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the maximum distance from the comet to the sun. I'm trying to find the maximum r. So in the polar equation, when would r be maximum? Because for an ellipse, the maximum distance from the focus is when the comet is at the farthest point, which occurs when cosθ is -1, right? Because as e is positive, when cosθ is -1, the denominator becomes 1 - e, so 1 - 0.97 = 0.03. So r would be (a*(1-e²)) / (1 - e).

Wait, let me think. The minimum distance (perihelion) occurs when cosθ = 1, so denominator 1+e. So r_min = l/(1+e) = (a*(1-e²))/(1+e) = a*(1-e), since (1-e²) = (1-e)(1+e). So r_min is a*(1-e).

Similarly, maximum distance (aphelion) is when cosθ = -1, so denominator 1 - e. So r_max = l/(1-e) = (a*(1-e²))/(1-e) = a*(1+e). Because (1-e²) = (1-e)(1+e), so (1-e²)/(1-e) = (1+e).

So r_max = a*(1+e). Because a is 18.09 AU, and e is 0.97. So 18.09 * (1 + 0.97) = 18.09 * 1.97.

Let me compute that. 18 * 1.97 is 35.46, and 0.09 * 1.97 is about 0.1773. So adding them together, 35.46 + 0.1773 = 35.6373 AU. Hmm, looking at the options, J is 35.64 AU. So the maximum distance should be approximately 35.64 AU.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes, I might have mixed up the major axis. Wait, the major axis is the longest diameter of the ellipse, so the sum of the distances from the two foci is 2a. So the maximum distance from one focus is a*(1+e), yes.

So a is 18.09 AU, so 18.09 * 1.97 = ?

Let me compute that more precisely. 18.09 * 1.97.

First, 18 * 1.97 = 35.46. Then 0.09 * 1.97 = 0.1773. So 35.46 + 0.1773 = 35.6373 AU, which is approximately 35.64 AU. So the correct answer is J.

Alternatively, another approach: Since the major axis is 36.18 AU, the semi-major axis is 18.09 AU. The distance from the center to each focus is c = a*e. So c = 18.09 * 0.97. Let me calculate that: 18 * 0.97 = 17.46, 0.09 * 0.97 = 0.0873. So c ≈ 17.46 + 0.0873 = 17.5473 AU.

The maximum distance from the sun (which is at one focus) would be the distance from the focus to the far end of the major axis. So that's a + c. Because the center is at a distance c from the focus, and the far end is at a distance a from the center on the other side. Wait, no. Actually, the center is at a distance c from the focus. The maximum distance from the focus is a + c. Because the far end is a units from the center in the opposite direction of the focus. So a + c = a + a*e = a(1+e), which is the same as before.

So a = 18.09, e=0.97, so 18.09 * (1+0.97) = 18.09 * 1.97 = 35.64 AU. So the maximum distance is 35.64 AU, which is option J.

To determine the maximum distance of Halley's comet from the sun, we start with the given parameters:

- Eccentricity \( e = 0.97 \)
- Length of the major axis \( = 36.18 \, \mathrm{AU} \)

The semi-major axis \( a \) is half the major axis, so:

\[
a = \frac{36.18}{2} = 18.09 \, \mathrm{AU}.
\]

For an elliptical orbit, the maximum distance from the focus (the sun) occurs at aphelion, which is given by:

\[
r_{\text{max}} = a(1 + e).
\]

Substituting \( a = 18.09 \, \mathrm{AU} \) and \( e = 0.97 \):

\[
r_{\text{max}} = 18.09 \times (1 + 0.97) = 18.09 \times 1.97.
\]

Calculating \( 18.09 \times 1.97 \):

\[
18.09 \times 1.97 = 35.6373 \, \mathrm{AU}.
\]

This rounds to \( 35.64 \, \mathrm{AU} \), which corresponds to option J.

Thus, the maximum distance from the comet to the sun is:

**J: 35.64 AU**
