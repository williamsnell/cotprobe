Question:

On May 2, a woman mailed the following letter to a man:"May 1I have two tickets to the concert on July 1 at the auditorium in town. I'll sell them to you for $60 per ticket, which is $10 above face value. Since the concert has been sold out for months, I think that is a good deal. You have 15 days from the above date to decide whether to accept this offer. "The man received the letter on May 4, but did not read it until May 6. On May 18, the man went to the woman's home and attempted to accept the offer. The woman replied:"Too late! I sold the tickets last week for $75 each. "Assume that the woman's letter created in the man a valid power of acceptance. Was that power terminated by lapse of time before the man went to the woman's home on May 17?

Options:

A: Yes, because the letter was mailed on May 2.
B: Yes, because the letter was dated May 1.
C: No, because the man received the letter on May 4.
D: No, because the man did not read the letter until May 6.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this contracts question. Hmm, let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly.

So, a woman sent a letter to a man on May 2. The letter was dated May 1. In the letter, she offers to sell him two concert tickets for $60 each, which is $10 above face value. She mentions that the concert is sold out and thinks it's a good deal. She gives him 15 days from the date of the letter (May 1) to decide whether to accept the offer. The man receives the letter on May 4 but doesn't read it until May 6. Then, on May 18, he goes to her home to accept the offer, but she says it's too late because she sold the tickets for $75 each the previous week.

The question is whether the power of acceptance lapsed before the man tried to accept on May 17. Wait, wait, the man went on May 18, but the question says "before the man went on May 17." Maybe that's a typo, but I'll go with what's written.

So, the key here is to determine when the offer expires. The offer says he has 15 days from May 1 to accept. So, the expiration date would be May 1 plus 15 days. Let me count that. May has 31 days. So May 1 plus 15 days is May 16 (since May 1 is day 1, then 2, ..., 16 would be the 15th day after). Wait, no, wait: If the offer is made on May 1, the 15 days would start counting from May 2. So day 1 is May 2, day 15 would be May 16. So the offer expires on May 16.

But the man didn't know about the offer until he read the letter on May 6. However, the question is about the termination of the power of acceptance. The offer's time limit is 15 days from May 1, so regardless of when the man receives or reads it, the offer should expire on May 16.

So when the man tried to accept on May 18, that's two days after the offer expired. But the question is whether the power was terminated before he went on May 17. Wait, May 17 is the day after the offer expired on May 16. So the power would have lapsed by May 17.

Wait, the options are about whether the power terminated before May 17. So if the 15 days ended on May 16, then on May 17, the power is already terminated. So the man's attempt on May 18 is too late, but the termination happened before May 17.

Wait, the question is: Was the power terminated by lapse of time before the man went on May 17? So before May 17, which would be up to May 16, the offer was still open. Wait, no. Wait, the offer expires on May 16. So on May 17, the power has already lapsed. So the termination happened before May 17? No, the termination happened on May 16. So up until May 16, the power was still in effect. So if he tried to accept on May 17, that would be after the offer expired.

Wait, the question is a bit confusing. Let me restate it. The man went to accept on May 18, but the question is whether the power was terminated before May 17. So the time frame is before May 17. So if the offer expires on May 16, then by May 17, the power has already terminated. Therefore, the power was terminated before May 17? No, because the termination occurred on May 16, which is before May 17. So the power was terminated before May 17. Wait, no. The power terminates at the end of the 15th day, which is May 16. So on May 17, it's already terminated. So the termination happened before May 17? Wait, May 16 is before May 17. So the power was terminated by May 16, which is before the man went on May 17.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The offer's time limit is 15 days from May 1, which is May 16. So the power of acceptance ends on May 16. So if the man tried to accept on May 17, the offer is already expired. Therefore, the power was terminated by lapse of time before May 17. So the answer would be yes, the power was terminated before May 17.

But looking at the options:

Option A: Yes, because the letter was mailed on May 2. But the time starts from May 1, the date in the letter, not when it's mailed.

Option B: Yes, because the letter was dated May 1. That would make the 15 days start on May 1, so the offer ends on May 16. So the man's attempt on May 18 is after, but the termination was by May 16, which is before May 17. So yes, the power was terminated before May 17. So option B would be correct.

Option C: No, because the man received the letter on May 4. But the time isn't based on receipt; it's based on the offer's terms, which start from May 1. So C is incorrect.

Option D: No, because the man didn't read it until May 6. Again, the time runs from the offer's date, not from when the offeree learns of it. So D is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer should be B: Yes, because the letter was dated May 1. So the 15 days started on May 1, ending on May 16, so the power was terminated before May 17.

The woman's letter, dated May 1, granted the man 15 days to accept the offer. The 15-day period began on May 1, and the offer expired on May 16. The man attempted to accept the offer on May 18, which was after the expiration date. The question asks whether the power of acceptance was terminated by lapse of time before May 17. Since the offer expired on May 16, the power of acceptance was indeed terminated before May 17.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The mailing date (May 2) is irrelevant because the offer's terms are based on the date of the letter (May 1).
- **Option B**: Correct. The letter was dated May 1, and the 15-day period ran from that date, expiring on May 16. Thus, the power of acceptance was terminated before May 17.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The date the man received the letter (May 4) does not affect the expiration date, which is determined by the offer's terms.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The date the man read the letter (May 6) is also irrelevant, as the offer's expiration is based on the date of the letter, not the offeree's knowledge of it.

The correct answer is **B**.
