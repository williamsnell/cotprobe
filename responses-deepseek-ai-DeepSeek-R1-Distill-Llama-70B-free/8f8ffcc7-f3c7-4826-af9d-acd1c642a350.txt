Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a block of wood floating in water. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on buoyancy, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question is asking what volume of the block will be above the water when it's floating. They gave me the density of the wood, which is 0.80 g/cm³, and the mass of the block is 1.0 kg. Wait, mass is in kg, so I should probably convert that to grams for consistency since the density is in grams per cm³. Right, 1.0 kg is 1000 grams.

I remember that when an object floats, it displaces a volume of water equal to its own mass. Oh wait, because the weight of the displaced water equals the weight of the object. So the mass of the displaced water is the same as the mass of the block, which is 1000 grams.

So the displaced water volume would be mass divided by the density of water. The density of water is 1.00 g/cm³, so that's easy. Volume = 1000 g / 1.00 g/cm³ = 1000 cm³. So the submerged volume is 1000 cm³.

Now, the block's own volume is mass divided by its density. The mass is 1000g, density 0.80 g/cm³. So volume = 1000 / 0.8 = 1250 cm³. Oh wait, that's the total volume of the block.

So if the submerged part is 1000 cm³, the part above water would be the total volume minus submerged. So 1250 - 1000 = 250 cm³. That means 250 cm³ is above the water.

Looking at the options, option B is 250 cm³. So the answer should be B.

To determine the volume of the block of wood above the water surface, we start by noting that the block floats, meaning it displaces a volume of water equal to its own weight. The mass of the block is given as 1.0 kg, which is equivalent to 1000 g. Since the density of water is 1.00 g/cm³, the submerged volume of the block is:

\[
\text{Submerged Volume} = \frac{\text{Mass of Block}}{\text{Density of Water}} = \frac{1000 \, \text{g}}{1.00 \, \text{g/cm}^3} = 1000 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

Next, we calculate the total volume of the block using its mass and density. The density of the block is 0.80 g/cm³, so:

\[
\text{Total Volume of Block} = \frac{\text{Mass of Block}}{\text{Density of Block}} = \frac{1000 \, \text{g}}{0.80 \, \text{g/cm}^3} = 1250 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

The volume of the block above the water surface is the total volume minus the submerged volume:

\[
\text{Volume Above Water} = \text{Total Volume} - \text{Submerged Volume} = 1250 \, \text{cm}^3 - 1000 \, \text{cm}^3 = 250 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

Thus, the volume of the block above the water surface is **250 cm³**, which corresponds to option **B**.
