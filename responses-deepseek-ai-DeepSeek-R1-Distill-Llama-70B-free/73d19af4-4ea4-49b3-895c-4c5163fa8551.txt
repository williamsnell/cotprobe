Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Burgess's concentric zone model. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is asking in which zone of Burgess's model you'd find better houses, single-family homes, and higher-rent apartments. The options are labeled A through J, but each corresponds to a zone or area in the model.

I remember that Burgess's model divides the city into five concentric zones. The first zone is the Central Business District (CBD), right? That's where all the commercial activities are, like shops, offices, and maybe some industries. So option A is CBD, which is zone 1, I think.

Then moving outward, the second zone is the industrial zone. I think that's where factories and warehouses are located. So option J is Industrial Zone, which should be zone 2. Wait, but looking at the options, the options are labeled A to J, each with a different part of the model. So A is CBD (zone 1), J is Industrial (zone 2).

Next, the third zone is what I'm trying to remember. I think it's the zone of working-class residential areas. Maybe that's where lower-income people live, in apartments or tenements. So better housing wouldn't be here. Option C is Second, but that's zone 2, which is industrial, so that's probably not it.

Zone 4, I believe, is the residential zone for higher-income people. So this would be where you find single-family homes and better-quality housing. Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recount the zones as per Burgess.

Burgess's model has five zones:

1. Central Business District (CBD)
2. Industrial zone
3. Working-class residential
4. Middle-class residential
5. Commuter zone (suburbs with higher-income homes)

Wait, no, the fifth zone is the outermost, which is the commuter zone or the suburbs. So in the fifth zone, you have the highest-income residential areas, single-family homes, and maybe even some luxury apartments. So the better houses and higher-rent apartments would be in the fifth zone.

Looking at the options, option E is labeled as Sixth. Wait, but Burgess only has five zones. Hmm, maybe the options are mislabeled, or perhaps I'm misremembering. Let me check again.

Wait, the options are A through J, each being a different zone. Let me list them:

A: Central Business District → Zone 1
B: Fifth → Zone 5
C: Second → Zone 2
D: Fourth → Zone 4
E: Sixth → Hmm, but Burgess only has five zones. So maybe option E isn't a Burgess zone. Or perhaps the options are using different labels. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to a different model, but I think it's Burgess's.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. The zones are:

1. CBD
2. Industrial
3. Working-class residential
4. Middle-class residential (better housing)
5. Suburbs/commuter zone (highest-income, single-family homes)

Wait, no, I think I might have mixed up zones 4 and 5. Because in some models, the fourth zone is the middle-class and the fifth is the commuter zone with higher-class homes.

So if the question is about better houses, single-family homes, higher-rent apartments, that would be in the commuter zone, which is the fifth zone.

Looking at the options, option B is Fifth. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes the model is presented with the commuter zone as the outermost. So in that case, the fifth zone would be the highest-income area.

Alternatively, I might have mixed up the numbering. Let me visualize the model:

- Center: Zone 1 (CBD)
- Next ring: Zone 2 (Industrial)
- Then Zone 3 (Working-class homes, maybe apartments)
- Zone 4: Middle-class, better single-family homes
- Zone 5: Suburbs, highest-income, more spacious.

So the fifth zone would have the best housing. So the question is asking where better houses and higher-rent apartments are, which would be in the fifth zone.

So the correct answer would be option B: Fifth.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option B is Fifth, which would be zone 5.

So the answer is B.

In Burgess's concentric zone model, the city is divided into five zones, with the Central Business District (CBD) at the center and progressively outward zones representing different land uses. The fifth zone, the outermost ring, is characterized as the commuter zone, where higher-income residential areas, single-family homes, and higher-rent apartments are typically found. This aligns with the description in the question, making the correct answer the fifth zone.

Answer: B
