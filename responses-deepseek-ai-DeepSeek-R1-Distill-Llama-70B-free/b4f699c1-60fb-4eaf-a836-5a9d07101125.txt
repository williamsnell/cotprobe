Okay, so I've got this problem about radioactive decay and half-lives. Hmm, I remember that a half-life is the time it takes for half of a radioactive substance to decay. The problem says the material has a half-life of 36 minutes, and we start with 10 grams. We need to find out how much is left after 2 hours.

Wait, wait. 2 hours is 120 minutes, right? So I should figure out how many half-lives have passed in that time. Let me divide 120 by 36. Let's see, 36 times 3 is 108, which leaves 12 minutes left. So 120 divided by 36 is 3 and 1/3, which is approximately 3.333... So that's 3.333 half-lives?

Now, each half-life reduces the quantity by half. So starting with 10 grams:

After the first half-life (36 min), it's 5 grams.

Second half-life (72 min), 2.5 grams.

Third half-life (108 min), 1.25 grams.

Wait, but 2 hours is 120 minutes, which is 12 minutes beyond 3 half-lives (which is 108 minutes). So the time is a bit more than three half-lives. Hmm, but the question is about 2 hours exactly, so maybe I should treat it as exactly 10/ (2^3.333) or something like that.

Wait another approach: The formula for radioactive decay is N = N0 * (1/2)^(t / t_half). Here, N0 is 10 grams, t is 120 minutes, and t_half is 36. So t/t_half is 120 /36 = 10/3 ≈ 3.333.

So N = 10 * (1/2)^(10/3).

Calculating that... Let's see, 2^(10/3) is the same as 2^3 * 2^(1/3) = 8 * cube root of 2. Cube root of 2 is about 1.26. So 8 * 1.26 is around 10.08.

Wait wait, wait. So (1/2)^(10/3) is 1/(2^(10/3)) which is 1/(8 * 1.26) ≈ 1/10.08 ≈ 0.0992. So N is 10 * 0.0992 ≈ 0.992 grams.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of the options are around 1 gram except option E, which is 1 gram. Hmm, but wait, maybe my approximation is off because 2^(1/3) is approximately 1.26, but perhaps the exact calculation would be better.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me think. Let's write the exponent as a fraction: 10/3 is 3 and 1/3. So 2^(1/3) is approximately 1.2599. So 2^(10/3) = 2^3 * 2^(1/3) = 8 * 1.2599 ≈ 10.0792.

So (1/2)^(10/3) = 1 /10.0792 ≈ 0.09921. Multiply by 10 grams gives 0.9921 grams, approximately 1 gram. Looking back at the options, option E is 1.00 grams. So is that the right answer?

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me check the initial approach again. Because in each half-life, the amount halves. So after 3 half-lives (108 minutes), the amount is 10 / (2^3) = 10/8 = 1.25 grams. Then, the remaining 12 minutes is a third of a half-life (since each half-life is 36 min). So for that 12 minutes, how much more decay happens?

Hmm, perhaps instead of approximating, I can calculate using the formula. Let me do that.

The number of half-lives (n) is t / t_half = 120 / 36 = 3.333333...

So the remaining amount is 10 * (1/2)^3.3333.

Alternatively, I can write this as 10 * (2^(-10/3)).

Wait, 2^(1/3) is the cube root of 2, which is about 1.25992105. So 2^(10/3) is 8 * 1.25992105 ≈ 10.07937. So 1/10.07937 ≈ 0.099206. Multiply by 10 gives 0.99206 grams, which is approximately 0.99 grams. So about 1 gram.

Looking at the options, option E is 1.00 grams. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me recheck the calculation because sometimes using the formula can be a bit tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use natural logarithms with the decay constant. The decay formula can also be written as N = N0 * e^(-kt), where k is the decay constant.

The decay constant k is ln(2) / t_half. So k = 0.6931 / 36 per minute.

Then, for t=120 minutes:

N = 10 * e^(- (0.6931/36) * 120 )

Simplify the exponent: (0.6931 * 120 ) / 36 = (0.6931 * 10 ) /3 = 6.931 /3 ≈ 2.3103.

So N = 10 * e^(-2.3103). e^(-2.3103) is approximately e^(-2.3026) is about 0.1, since e^(-2.3026)=1/e^2.3026 ≈ 1/10. So e^(-2.3103) is a little less than 0.1. Let me calculate it more accurately.

e^2.3103: Let's compute 2.3103.

e^2 is about 7.389. e^0.3103 is approximately e^0.3 is about 1.34986. So e^2.3103 ≈7.389 * 1.34986 ≈ 9.97. So 1/e^2.3103 ≈ 0.1003.

So N ≈10 * 0.1003 = 1.003 grams, which is about 1.00 grams. So again, option E.

Wait, but I'm a little confused because when I did the initial step-by-step with three half-lives, it gave me 1.25 grams. Adding another 12 minutes would decrease it further, but according to the formula, it's about 1 gram. So maybe my initial approach was wrong because I thought 120 min is 3 and 1/3 half-lives, but perhaps the formula is more accurate.

So the correct answer should be approximately 1.00 grams, which is option E.

To determine how many grams of the radioactive material remain after 2 hours, we use the concept of half-lives. The material has a half-life of 36 minutes, meaning every 36 minutes, half of the material decays. 

First, calculate the number of half-lives that pass in 2 hours (120 minutes):

\[
\text{Number of half-lives} = \frac{\text{Total time}}{\text{Half-life}} = \frac{120}{36} = 3.\overline{3} \, \text{(or 3 and 1/3)}.
\]

The formula for radioactive decay is:

\[
N = N_0 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\text{Number of half-lives}},
\]

where \(N_0 = 10 \, \text{grams}\) is the initial amount, and \(N\) is the remaining amount. Substituting the values:

\[
N = 10 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{3.\overline{3}}.
\]

To simplify, \(3.\overline{3}\) can be expressed as \(10/3\), so:

\[
N = 10 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{10/3}.
\]

Using the property of exponents, \((1/2)^{10/3} = 1 / 2^{10/3}\). The value of \(2^{10/3}\) is:

\[
2^{10/3} = 2^3 \cdot 2^{1/3} = 8 \cdot \text{cube root of 2}.
\]

The cube root of 2 is approximately \(1.26\), so:

\[
2^{10/3} \approx 8 \cdot 1.26 = 10.08.
\]

Thus:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{10/3} \approx \frac{1}{10.08} \approx 0.0992.
\]

Finally:

\[
N = 10 \cdot 0.0992 \approx 0.992 \, \text{grams}.
\]

This is approximately \(1.00 \, \text{gram}\). Comparing this result to the options provided, the closest match is:

**E: 1.00 grams.**
