Okay, so I've got this problem about LSAT scores and normal distribution. Hmm, I remember that the normal distribution is bell-shaped and that most of the data falls around the mean. The mean here is 650, and the standard deviation is 45. So, the question is about applicants with scores above 700 being considered, and we need to find what percentage of them have scores below 740.

Wait, so first, only applicants scoring above 700 are considered. That means we're dealing with the part of the distribution above 700. But within this group, how many have scores below 740?

I think I need to calculate the z-scores for both 700 and 740. Z-score is (X - μ)/σ. So for 700, z = (700-650)/45. Let me calculate that: 50/45 is approximately 1.111. For 740, z = (740-650)/45 = 90/45 = 2. So the z-scores are about 1.11 and 2.

Now, since we're looking at the area above 700, which is a z of 1.11, and within that area, up to 740 (z=2), I think I need to find the proportion between these two z-scores.

Wait, maybe I should draw this out. The mean is 650. 700 is one standard deviation above? Wait, no, because 45*1 is 45, so 650 +45=695. So 700 is a bit above one sigma. And 740 is two sigma above the mean.

But the question is about the applicants above 700. So the group we're considering is those with scores above 700. From that group, what percentage have scores below 740?

So, in terms of probabilities, it's P(X < 740 | X >700). Which is equal to P(700 < X <740) / P(X>700).

To find this, I'll calculate the z-scores for 700 and 740, find the area between them, and then divide by the area above 700.

So for z=1.11, the area to the left is... let me think. I remember standard normal tables. At z=1.0, the area to the left is about 0.8413. At z=1.1, it's about 0.8665. Wait, maybe I should use a calculator. Alternatively, maybe I can approximate it.

Wait, I think using a z-table is the way to go. So for z=1.11, what's the cumulative probability? Let me recall that for z=1.1, it's 0.8665. For z=1.11, maybe it's about 0.8665 + (0.1*(difference between 1.1 and 1.2)). Wait, at z=1.1, it's 0.8665, and at z=1.2, it's 0.8841. So for each 0.01 increase in z, the area increases by (0.8841 -0.8665)/0.1 = 0.0176 per 0.1, so 0.00176 per 0.01.

So for z=1.11, it's 0.8665 + 0.00176 *1 = 0.86826. Let me check that. Alternatively, I might have a more precise way, but perhaps I can just remember that z=1.11 is approximately 0.8686 probability.

Wait, maybe I should just use the exact values. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the empirical rule, but that's only for multiples of sigma. Alternatively, using the standard normal distribution table online, but since I can't access that, I'll proceed with my approximations.

So, the area to the left of z=1.11 is approximately 0.868, and the area to the left of z=2 is about 0.9772.

So the area between z=1.11 and z=2 is 0.9772 - 0.868 = 0.1092. But wait, that's the area between 700 and 740 in the entire distribution. But since we're considering only the area above 700, we have to find what proportion of that area is up to 740.

So the area above 700 is 1 - 0.868 = 0.132, approximately.

Wait, wait, no. Because the area to the left of z=1.11 is 0.868, so the area to the right is 1 - 0.868 = 0.132. So the group we're considering is that 13.2% of the total.

Now, the area between 700 and 740 is 0.9772 - 0.868 = 0.1092.

Wait, no, because 0.9772 is the area up to 740, and 0.868 is up to 700. So the area between 700 and 740 is 0.9772 - 0.868 = 0.1092. So that's 10.92% of the entire distribution.

But in the context of the applicants above 700, which is 13.2%, the proportion that is below 740 is (10.92%) / (13.2%) ) *100.

So 10.92 /13.2 = approximately 0.827. So 82.7%. Looking at the options, let me check. The options are A:75%, B:86.7%, C:50%, D:80%, E:13.3%, F:60.5%, G:90%, H:67.2%, I:82.9%, J:17.1%.

Hmm, 82.7% is close to option I, which is 82.9%. But wait, perhaps my approximations were off. Let me recalculate more accurately.

Let me think again about the z-scores. z1 = (700-650)/45 = 50/45 ≈1.1111. z2 = (740-650)/45 = 90/45=2.

Looking up z=1.11 in the standard normal table: Let me recall that for z=1.10, the cumulative is 0.8665. For z=1.11, it's 0.8665 + (0.0019) = 0.8684? Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, using a more precise method.

The exact area for z=1.11 can be found using the standard normal table. Let's say for z=1.11, the area to the left is approximately 0.8686. So the area above 700 is 1 - 0.8686 = 0.1314 (about 13.14%).

The area up to z=2 is 0.9772. So the area between 700 and 740 is 0.9772 - 0.8686 = 0.1086, which is 10.86% of the total.

So the proportion within the group above 700 that is below 740 is 10.86 /13.14 approximately.

Calculating that: 10.86 /13.14 = let's see, 10.86 ÷13.14 ≈0.827, so 82.7%.

Looking at the options, option I is 82.9%, which is very close. So probably the correct answer is I.

Wait, but wait a second, perhaps I should double-check the z-scores and the areas.

Another approach: instead of using the entire distribution, perhaps I should use the conditional probability. So P(X <740 | X>700) = P(700 < X <740) / P(X>700).

We've computed P(X>700) as 1 - Φ(1.1111) ≈ 1 - 0.8686 = 0.1314.

P(X <740) is Φ(2) = 0.9772. P(X <700) is Φ(1.1111) = 0.8686. So P(700 < X <740) is 0.9772 - 0.8686 = 0.1086.

So the conditional probability is 0.1086 / 0.1314 ≈0.826, which is 82.6%. The closest option is I:82.9%.

Wait, but perhaps the exact calculation would give a slightly different value. Maybe using more precise z-scores.

Wait, let me compute z1 more accurately. 700-650=50. 50/45=1.1111... So z=1.1111.

Looking up z=1.11 in the standard normal table. From tables I remember:

z=1.10: 0.8665

z=1.11: approx 0.8686.

Wait, wait, in reality, for z=1.11, the cumulative is about 0.8686. So 1 - 0.8686=0.1314.

And as before, the area between is 0.1086.

So 0.1086 /0.1314 = let me compute this exactly.

0.1086 ÷ 0.1314 ≈

Well, 0.1314 *0.826 = approximately 0.1086.

But let me do the division more accurately.

0.1086 ÷ 0.1314 = (1086/10000) ÷ (1314/10000) )= 1086/1314.

Let me compute 1086 ÷1314.

Divide numerator and denominator by 6: 181 / 219.

Hmm, 219 ×0.826 is approximately 219*(0.8 +0.026) = 175.2 +5.694=180.894. Which is very close to 181. So 181/219 is approximately 0.826.

So 82.6%, which is very close to 82.9% in option I.

Wait, but perhaps the exact value is 82.9%, so why the slight discrepancy?

Alternatively, perhaps using more precise z-scores. Let me think about using a calculator approach.

Alternatively, using the empirical rule: for a normal distribution, 68% within 1σ, 95% within 2σ, 99.7% within 3σ. But since 700 is above 1σ (which is 650+45=695), and 740 is exactly 2σ.

Wait, the area above 700 would be the area above z=1.1111, which is less than 2.5%? Wait, no, because 2σ is about 2.28% in one tail. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no, for z=2, the area beyond is about 2.28%, so for z=1.11, the area beyond is larger. Let me think: for z=1, it's about 15.87% in the upper tail. For z=1.1, it's about 13.59%. For z=1.11, it would be a bit less than that. Wait, perhaps I should recall that the standard normal table gives the area to the left. So for z=1.11, area to left is 0.8686, so area to the right is 0.1314, as before.

Hmm, perhaps the exact calculation would require integrating the normal distribution between these two z-scores, but perhaps the initial approximation is sufficient.

So based on the calculation, the percentage is approximately 82.6%, which is closest to option I:82.9%.

So the answer should be I.

To solve the problem, we start by noting that LSAT scores are normally distributed with a mean (μ) of 650 and a standard deviation (σ) of 45. The question asks for the percentage of applicants with scores above 700 who also have scores below 740. This requires calculating conditional probabilities using the properties of the normal distribution.

### Step 1: Calculate z-scores
The z-scores for the given LSAT scores are calculated as:
- For 700:  
  \[
  z_1 = \frac{700 - 650}{45} = \frac{50}{45} \approx 1.111
  \]
- For 740:  
  \[
  z_2 = \frac{740 - 650}{45} = \frac{90}{45} = 2
  \]

### Step 2: Find the probabilities
Using the standard normal distribution table:
- The area to the left of \( z_1 = 1.111 \) is approximately \( 0.8686 \), so the area to the right of \( z_1 \) is:
  \[
  P(X > 700) = 1 - 0.8686 = 0.1314
  \]
- The area to the left of \( z_2 = 2 \) is approximately \( 0.9772 \), so the area between \( z_1 = 1.111 \) and \( z_2 = 2 \) is:
  \[
  P(700 < X < 740) = 0.9772 - 0.8686 = 0.1086
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate the conditional probability
The conditional probability \( P(X < 740 | X > 700) \) is given by:
\[
P(X < 740 | X > 700) = \frac{P(700 < X < 740)}{P(X > 700)} = \frac{0.1086}{0.1314} \approx 0.826
\]
This corresponds to approximately \( 82.6\% \).

### Step 4: Match with the closest option
The closest option to \( 82.6\% \) is \( 82.9\% \), which corresponds to option **I**.
