Question:

The frequency of the gene for sickle-cell anemia in African-Americans is less than that found in the people living in their ancestral home in Africa. What factors might account for this difference?

Options:

A: Sickle-cell disease is more deadly in America
B: Sickle-cell disease has been completely eradicated in America
C: The sickle-cell gene mutates at a lower rate in America
D: Genetic drift has led to a decrease in the frequency of the sickle-cell gene in African-Americans
E: Increased medical intervention in America allows individuals with sickle-cell disease to live longer and reproduce more
F: There is no difference in the frequency of the sickle-cell gene between African-Americans and their African ancestors
G: In America, the incidence of malaria is insignificant, sickle-cell genes are being diluted by normal genes and interracial marriages.
H: There is a higher survival rate for sickle-cell carriers in America
I: Sickle-cell allele is more dominant in Africa
J: The sickle-cell allele is being actively selected against in the African-American population

Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about sickle-cell anemia frequencies in African-Americans versus their ancestral African populations. Hmm, I remember that sickle-cell anemia is a genetic disorder, and it's related to malaria somehow. Let me think through this.

The question is asking why the frequency of the sickle-cell gene is lower in African-Americans compared to their ancestors in Africa. I remember that in Africa, the sickle-cell trait actually offers some protection against malaria. So in areas where malaria is prevalent, having the sickle-cell allele (HbS) can be beneficial because it provides a survival advantage, especially in heterozygotes (carriers).

Wait, but in the US, the situation might be different. I think the US doesn't have much malaria anymore because of better healthcare and mosquito control. So in Africa, where malaria is a big problem, the HbS allele is selected for. But in the US, without that selective pressure, maybe the allele isn't as common.

Also, when populations migrate, their gene pool can change. African-Americans are a diaspora population. Maybe there's something about the environment in the US that affects the allele frequency. Oh, right, genetic drift could play a role, but I'm not sure if that's the main factor here. Or perhaps it's natural selection against the allele in the US.

Wait, another angle: in Africa, carriers (heterozygotes) have a higher chance of survival because of malaria resistance, so the allele stays frequent. In the US, without that advantage, the allele might decrease. Also, maybe there's more medical intervention for sickle-cell disease in the US, but that would help individuals survive, which might allow them to pass on the gene. But the question says the frequency is lower, so that doesn't explain it.

Oh, another point: in the US, the population might have more mixing with groups that don't have the sickle-cell allele. So through interracial marriages or a more diverse gene pool, the frequency could dilute. So if African-Americans intermarry with people of European or other descent where the HbS allele is rare, the frequency would drop in the African-American population over generations.

So putting it together, the factors could be that in the US, there's less malaria, so the selective advantage of the HbS allele is gone. Without that, the allele isn't maintained at the same frequency. Also, genetic dilution from a more diverse population mixing could lower the frequency.

Looking at the options:

Option G says that in America, malaria incidence is low, so the sickle-cell genes are being diluted by normal genes and interracial marriages. That seems to fit because without malaria, the HbS doesn't have the same advantage, and mixing with other populations would introduce more normal alleles.

Option J says the allele is being actively selected against. That's possible too. If being homozygous recessive (SS) is selected against because the disease is severe, but in the US, maybe the selection is against it. But wait, in Africa, SS individuals have lower survival, but the heterozygotes are protected against malaria. So in the US, without the protective effect, the allele might be selected against because the carriers don't have the advantage, but still have some issues. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the main point.

Another possibility is that in the US, the allele isn't beneficial, so it's more subject to negative selection. But I think the main reason is the lack of malaria pressure and gene dilution through mixing. So option G seems better.

The frequency of the sickle-cell gene is lower in African-Americans compared to their ancestral African populations due to several factors. In Africa, the sickle-cell allele (HbS) is maintained at a higher frequency because heterozygotes (carriers) have a survival advantage in malaria-endemic regions. However, in the United States, malaria is virtually absent, so the selective advantage of the HbS allele is lost. Without this protective effect, the allele is no longer favored, and its frequency decreases.

Additionally, in the U.S., there is greater genetic diversity due to interracial marriages and mixing with populations where the HbS allele is rare. This genetic dilution further reduces the frequency of the sickle-cell allele in the African-American population. These factors collectively explain the lower frequency of the sickle-cell gene in African-Americans compared to their ancestral home in Africa.

The best answer is **G**.
