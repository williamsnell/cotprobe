Okay, so I need to answer this multiple-choice question about Alan Dershowitz's views on torture methods. Hmm, I remember Dershowitz is a legal scholar and has written about this topic. The question is asking which method he believes is appropriate when torture is permissible.

Wait, I think Dershowitz is known for his argument that in extreme cases, like a "ticking time bomb" scenario, torture might be justifiable. But I'm not exactly sure which specific method he suggests. Let me think. I recall that he proposed something called "torture warrants," where the authorities would get judicial approval before using torture in such emergency situations.

As for the methods, I remember he was specific about a particular technique. Wasn't it something that causes pain but isn't lethal? Oh right, I think he mentioned using a needle under the fingernails. Or was it something else? Wait, no, that might be another person's idea. Alternatively, I think he talked about non-lethal methods like submerging someone in water, which is waterboarding. Or maybe it was something like sleep deprivation or psychological tactics.

Wait, let me clarify. Dershowitz, in his book "Why Terrorism Works," discusses the need for a legal framework for torture in extreme cases. He specifically mentions a method involving a sterilized needle being inserted under the nails. Oh, but wait, that sounds really painful. Or was it another method, like forcing someone to stand for long periods? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this confused with other authors.

Wait, another thought: Dershowitz is often associated with the idea of non-lethal but very painful methods. Oh, I think he suggested using a needle under the fingernail as a form of torture that's controlled and doesn't cause permanent damage. But looking at the options, option H is about a sterilized needle under the nails. Alternatively, option C is waterboarding, which is submerging so the person feels like they're drowning.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. I might have mixed up Dershowitz with others. Let me try to remember. I think he proposed a method that's both painful and non-lethal, something that doesn't leave marks. The needle under the nail would be very painful but maybe not leave lasting damage. So option H says "having a sterilized needle shoved under the victim's fingernails." That sounds like what I'm thinking of.

Alternatively, I might be confusing it with something else. Another point I remember is that Dershowitz argued against more severe forms of torture, advocating for methods that are less invasive. So maybe he suggested something like sleep deprivation or psychological methods. But looking at the options, option G is psychological manipulation, which could fit. But I'm not sure if that's what he specifically said.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to recall. Dershowitz's main point was about the necessity of having a legal framework for torture in extreme cases. He discussed the idea of a "torture warrant," similar to a search warrant, where a judge would have to approve the use of torture. As for the method, I think he suggested something that's both effective and doesn't cause permanent harm. The needle under the nail, while extremely painful, would be such a method. So that points to option H.

But I'm not 100% certain. Another angle: the question asks which is a method Dershowitz believes is appropriate when torture is permissible. From what I've read, he was critical of methods that cause severe physical harm and preferred more controlled, non-lethal techniques. So maybe he suggested something like sensory deprivation or psychological techniques, which are options D and G. Or perhaps he didn't specify a method but rather the legal process, making the answer F, none of the above.

Wait, now I'm getting more confused. Let me think again. The options are A to J. The question is about a specific method he approves. I think Dershowitz, in his discussions, did mention the needle under the nail as an example of a non-lethal method that could be used under a warrant system. So option H would be the answer.

Alternatively, I might be mixing this up with another scholar or a different context. Another thought: Dershowitz has also discussed the difference between torture and "torture lite," where the latter includes methods like sleep deprivation and psychological tactics. So maybe he supports those. Looking at the options, A is prolonged sleep deprivation, which could be considered "torture lite." But I'm not sure if he specifically endorses that as appropriate.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. From what I remember, Dershowitz's example was the sterilized needle under the nails. So the answer should be H.

But another possibility: in some of his debates, he's argued against waterboarding, saying it's torture. So option C is waterboarding, which he might not support. So if that's the case, then H remains the choice.

Wait, I'm still a bit unsure. Alternatively, if none of the options are correct, the answer would be F. But I think H is the correct option based on what I remember.

The question asks which method of torture Alan Dershowitz believes is appropriate in cases where torture is permissible. Dershowitz, a legal scholar, has argued that in extreme scenarios, such as a "ticking time bomb" situation, torture might be justifiable under a legal framework, such as a "torture warrant." He has specifically discussed the use of non-lethal, controlled methods of torture that cause pain without permanent harm. Among the options provided, the method involving a sterilized needle being shoved under the victim's fingernails (option H) aligns with Dershowitz's arguments about using painful yet non-lethal techniques in extreme cases.

Answer: H
