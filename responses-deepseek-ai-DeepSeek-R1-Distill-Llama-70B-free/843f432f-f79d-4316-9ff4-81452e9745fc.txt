Question:

On May 1, a homeowner and a painter entered into a contract whereby the painter was to paint the homeowner's home in exchange for $10,000. The contract stated:"The painting is to be done during the month of June, and payment is to be made within one week after the painting is completed. The rights under this contact are not to be assigned. "The painter started the painting on June 1. On June 10, the painter assigned to his nephew the right to receive payment on the painter's contract with the homeowner. Which of the following statements is most accurate with regard to the painter's assignment to his nephew?

Options:

A: The assignment would constitute a novation, relieving the homeowner of liability.
B: The assignment would be valid only if the homeowner consents to it.
C: The assignment would be effective only after the painting is completed.
D: The assignment would be revocable even if it were reduced to writing and signed by the painter.
E: The assignment would be irrevocable if it were reduced to writing and signed by the painter.
F: The assignment would not constitute a novation, relieving the homeowner of liability.
G: Since personal service contracts of this nature are nonassignable, the homeowner would be under no duty to pay the nephew.
H: The homeowner would not be obligated to pay the nephew, since the contract was nonassignable.
I: The homeowner would be obligated to pay the nephew, since the contract was assignable.

Okay, so I've got this contract law question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the question is about a contract between a homeowner and a painter. The contract is for painting the home in exchange for $10,000. The key points in the contract are:

1. The painting must be done during June.
2. Payment is to be made within one week after completion.
3. The rights under this contract are not to be assigned.

So the painter starts painting on June 1st. Then, on June 10th, he assigns his right to receive payment to his nephew. The question is about the validity of this assignment.

Hmm, I remember that contracts can sometimes prohibit assignment. The general rule is that contractual rights are assignable unless the contract specifically says they can't be. But there are exceptions, especially in personal service contracts where the individual's performance matters a lot.

Wait, in this case, the contract explicitly states that the rights are not to be assigned. So that's a clear clause against assignment. But I also recall that even if a contract says rights are nonassignable, an assignment might still be possible, but it could be revoked under certain conditions.

The painter assigned the right to receive payment. Payment is usually considered a right, not a duty. So the painter is assigning the right to get the money, not the duty to paint. So the nephew would be the one entitled to payment, but the painter is still obligated to perform the painting.

I think that the assignment of payment rights is generally allowed unless the contract prohibits it. But here, the contract does prohibit assignment of rights. So does that mean the assignment is invalid?

Wait, but the prohibition on assignment is in the contract. So the homeowner and painter agreed that rights can't be assigned. If the painter tries to assign despite that, what happens?

I remember that an anti-assignment clause can prevent the assignment. But sometimes, such clauses only prevent the assignment of duties, not rights. Or maybe when the rights are personal in nature.

In this case, the painter is assigning the right to receive payment. Since the contract says rights cannot be assigned, that would likely make the assignment ineffective. But wait, I also remember that some jurisdictions might treat such clauses as not completely barring assignment but making them revocable.

Wait, the general rule is that a clause prohibiting assignment doesn't make the assignment invalid; it just means the obligor (here, the homeowner) can choose to treat it as a breach if they wish. Or maybe it allows the obligor to withhold payment until the assignment is revoked.

Wait, no, I think that an express prohibition against assignment in the contract makes any assignment a breach. So if the painter assigns despite the clause, it's a breach, but does that render the assignment ineffective?

Alternatively, maybe the assignment is valid, but the obligee (homeowner) can choose to terminate the contract because of the breach. Or perhaps the assignment is void.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The UCC and common law have different rules. For service contracts, which this seems to be, the assignment of payment rights is generally allowed unless the contract prohibits it. But even then, some say that such a clause only makes the assignment revocable, not outright invalid.

Wait, the question is about the assignment of the right to receive payment. So it's an assignment of a right, not a delegation of duty. The painter is still responsible for painting, which is a personal service. So the key is whether the right to payment can be assigned despite the clause.

In general, an anti-assignment clause in a contract can prevent the assignment of the right to receive payment. So if the contract says rights cannot be assigned, the painter can't assign them. So the assignment to the nephew would not be valid, and the homeowner doesn't have to pay the nephew.

But wait, another angle: some courts hold that even with an anti-assignment clause, an assignment is effective, but it's revocable. So the assignor (painter) can revoke it, but once it's made, the assignee (nephew) has rights unless revoked.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me look at the options.

Option G says that since it's a personal service contract, the homeowner doesn't have to pay the nephew. That makes sense because personal service contracts are typically nonassignable. But wait, the assignment here is of the payment right, not the duty to perform. So maybe this doesn't apply.

Option H says the homeowner doesn't have to pay because the contract was nonassignable. That seems to align with the idea that the assignment is prohibited.

Option I says the homeowner is obligated to pay the nephew because the contract was assignable. But the contract explicitly says rights cannot be assigned, so I think this is wrong.

Options A and F talk about novation. A novation would replace the original contract with a new one, requiring the homeowner's consent. But the question is about assignment, not novation. So A and F are probably not correct.

Options B and E: Assignment being valid only with consent or being irrevocable if written. But if the contract prohibits assignment, even a written assignment might not be valid.

Option C says assignment is effective after painting is completed. But the assignment happened on June 10, before completion. So maybe the assignment can't take effect until the painting is done. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, the assignment of the right to receive payment can be made even before the payment is due. So the timing (June 10) might not invalidate it unless the contract prohibits it.

Putting it all together, the contract prohibits assignment of rights. So the painter's assignment to his nephew would likely be ineffective. Therefore, the homeowner isn't obligated to pay the nephew. So the correct answer would be either G or H.

Option G says personal service contracts are nonassignable, so homeowner has no duty. Option H says because the contract was nonassignable, the homeowner isn't obligated.

Wait, the contract's clause says rights are not to be assigned. So the assignment is prohibited, making the assignment invalid. So the homeowner doesn't have to pay the nephew. So H would be correct.

But wait, another thought: some jurisdictions allow the assignment despite the clause, but make it revocable. So the assignment is effective until revoked. So the nephew would have a right unless the painter revokes it.

But the question is about the validity of the assignment. If the contract prohibits assignment, the assignment is ineffective, so H would be correct.

Alternatively, if the assignment is revocable, then the homeowner could choose to pay the original painter. But in this case, the question is whether the assignment is valid. Since the contract prohibits it, the assignment is not valid, so the nephew has no right.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Let me recall: under the common law, a clause in the contract prohibiting assignment makes any assignment of rights a breach. So the assignment is not automatically invalid, but the obligor (homeowner) can choose to treat it as a breach and perhaps withhold performance.

Wait, but the assignment itself may not be rendered invalid by the clause; it's just that the obligor can choose to terminate the contract because of the breach.

Alternatively, if the assignment is made despite the prohibition, the obligee (homeowner) can ignore the assignment and pay the original obligor (painter), and if they do pay the assignee (nephew), they might still be liable to the painter.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to look at the options again.

Option H: The homeowner would not be obligated to pay the nephew, since the contract was nonassignable.

If the contract prohibits assignment, then the assignment is ineffective, so the homeowner doesn't have to pay the nephew. So H would be correct.

But wait, another point: in some cases, even if the contract prohibits assignment, the assignment can still be effective, but the assignor can revoke it. So the nephew would have a right unless the painter revokes it. But the question doesn't mention revocation, just the initial assignment.

Wait, option E says the assignment is irrevocable if written and signed. But I don't think that's the case. Generally, assignments can be revoked unless there's consideration for the assignment or it's made in a way that's intended to be irrevocable (like in a trust).

So in this case, the painter's assignment to his nephew is likely revocable, even if written. So option D says it's revocable even if written, which would be correct if the assignment is otherwise valid.

Wait, but if the contract prohibits assignment, then even if the assignment is made, it's ineffective. So the assignment doesn't transfer any rights, so it's not about being revocable, but that it's invalid from the start.

Alternatively, perhaps the assignment is valid but the homeowner can choose to treat it as a breach. But the question is about the duty to pay the nephew.

Wait, let's think of it this way: the contract says rights cannot be assigned. Painter assigns to nephew. So, under the contract's terms, the painter has breached by assigning. Does this mean the assignment is invalid, or does it just give the homeowner the option to terminate or withhold payment?

If the assignment is invalid, the nephew has no right to payment. If it's a breach, the homeowner can choose to accept the assignment or not.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the options again.

Option G: Personal service contracts are nonassignable, so no duty to pay nephew.

Option H: Nonassignable contract, so no duty.

If the contract's clause prohibits assignment, then the assignment is ineffective. So H would be correct.

But wait, the nature of the contract is for personal services (painting), which are generally not assignable. So even without the clause, the right to payment might not be assignable because the service is personal. So G might be correct.

Wait, but the assignment is of the payment right, not the performance. So maybe it's still assignable unless the contract prohibits it.

Wait, some sources say that the right to receive payment (a chose in action) is assignable unless the contract prohibits it, even in personal service contracts. So the contract's clause is crucial here.

If the contract says no assignment, then the assignment is prohibited, making it ineffective. So the nephew can't collect, so the homeowner doesn't have to pay him.

Therefore, the correct answer would be H.

Alternatively, if the contract's clause only makes the assignment revocable, not invalid, then perhaps the nephew can still collect unless the painter revokes it.

Wait, but if the contract prohibits assignment, it's a breach, but the assignment might still be effective. So the homeowner could choose to recognize it or not.

This is getting tricky. Let me try to recall the rules.

Under UCC §2-210, a contractual provision prohibiting assignment is enforceable, but it doesn't necessarily make the assignment invalid. It just allows the obligor to refuse payment to the assignee and pay the assignor instead, unless the assignee is a holder in due course.

Wait, but this is a service contract, not a sale of goods, so common law applies.

At common law, an assignment of a right under a contract is effective unless the contract prohibits it. But even with a prohibition, the assignment may still be effective, but the obligor can treat it as a breach and perhaps withhold performance. Or the obligor can recognize the assignment but have the right to terminate.

Wait, I'm getting myself more confused. Let me try to find a clear approach.

In this scenario, the contract prohibits assignment of rights. Painter assigns to nephew. The question is whether the assignment is valid.

If the contract prohibits assignment, the assignment is ineffective. So the nephew has no right to payment, and the homeowner must pay the painter.

Therefore, the correct answer would be H: The homeowner would not be obligated to pay the nephew, since the contract was nonassignable.

Alternatively, if the assignment is effective despite the clause, then the homeowner must pay the nephew unless they object. But I think the presence of the clause makes the assignment ineffective.

So the answer is H.
</think>

The question revolves around a contract between a homeowner and a painter, where the painter assigns the right to receive payment to his nephew despite a clause in the contract stating that "the rights under this contract are not to be assigned." The key issue is whether this assignment is valid and whether the homeowner is obligated to pay the nephew.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Contract Terms and Anti-Assignment Clause**: The contract explicitly prohibits the assignment of rights. Under common law, such a clause generally makes any assignment of rights ineffective unless the obligee (homeowner) consents to it.

2. **Nature of the Contract**: The contract involves personal services (painting), which are typically considered nonassignable because the performance depends on the individual's skill and efforts. However, the assignment here is of the right to receive payment, not the duty to perform the painting.

3. **Effect of the Anti-Assignment Clause**: The clause prohibits the assignment of rights, making the painter's assignment to his nephew ineffective. As a result, the nephew has no right to payment, and the homeowner remains obligated to pay the painter.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A and F**: These involve novation, which is irrelevant here because the question is about assignment, not replacing the original contract.
   - **Option B and E**: These focus on consent or irrevocability, but the contract's anti-assignment clause makes the assignment ineffective regardless of these factors.
   - **Option C**: The assignment's timing (before completion) does not affect its validity; the key issue is the anti-assignment clause.
   - **Option D**: While assignments are typically revocable, the clause here makes the assignment ineffective from the start.
   - **Option G**: Personal service contracts are generally nonassignable, but the assignment here is of payment rights, not duties. The anti-assignment clause is the decisive factor.
   - **Option H**: This correctly reflects that the homeowner is not obligated to pay the nephew because the contract prohibits assignment of rights.
   - **Option I**: Incorrect, as the contract explicitly prohibits assignment, making the assignment invalid.

### Conclusion:
The anti-assignment clause in the contract renders the painter's assignment to his nephew ineffective. Therefore, the homeowner is not obligated to pay the nephew. The correct answer is:

**H: The homeowner would not be obligated to pay the nephew, since the contract was nonassignable.**
