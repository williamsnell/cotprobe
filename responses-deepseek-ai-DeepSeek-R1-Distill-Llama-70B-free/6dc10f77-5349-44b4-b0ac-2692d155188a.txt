Okay, so I've got this fluid mechanics problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it my best shot.

The problem is about calculating pressure loss in a pipeline system with different valves. The setup is a liquid flowing through a horizontal pipe with various fittings. The data given includes the liquid's temperature, flow rate, pipe dimensions, and the types of fittings involved. I need to find the pressure loss when using gate valves and then globe valves.

First, I'll list out all the given data to keep things clear:

- Liquid temperature: 90°F
- Flow rate (Q): 40 gal/min
- Pipe inner diameter (D): 1.61 inches
- Pipe length (L): 50 feet
- Fittings: two 90° standard elbows, two valves (gate and globe), and a tee joint across the flow.
- Density (ρ): 53 lb_m/ft³
- Viscosity (μ): 0.5 centipoise (cp)

Wait, centipoise is 0.01 Poise, right? And 1 Poise is 1 dyn·s/cm². But for calculations here, I think I'll need to convert it to lb·s/ft² because the units in the problem are in the English system.

Wait, another thought: I remember that 1 cp = 0.01 Poise, and 1 Poise = 0.06719685 lb·s/ft². So 0.5 cp would be 0.5 * 0.0006719685 lb·s/ft², which is approximately 0.00033598 lb·s/ft². I'll keep that in mind.

The main formula I think I need here is the Darcy-Weisbach equation for pressure loss due to friction in a pipe, but since we have multiple fittings, I should also consider the minor losses from each fitting.

The Darcy-Weisbach equation is:

h_f = (f * L * v²) / (2 * g * D)

But wait, h_f is the head loss due to friction. Since the question asks for pressure loss, and pressure is force per unit area, I'll need to convert head loss to pressure using the formula:

ΔP = ρ * g * h_f

But maybe there's a more straightforward approach using units that are compatible.

Alternatively, the formula for pressure drop considering both friction and minor losses is:

ΔP_total = ΔP_friction + ΣΔP_minors

ΔP_friction is the pressure loss due to the pipe's length, and the minor losses come from elbows, valves, tees, etc.

Each minor loss is calculated using the K-value (resistance coefficient) for each fitting, multiplied by the velocity head (v²/(2g)).

So, the total pressure loss would be:

ΔP_total = (f * L * v²)/(2 * g * D) + (K_total * v²)/(2g)

Where K_total is the sum of all the K-values from the fittings.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused about whether to use the Darcy-Weisbach factor or the Hazen-Williams equation. Oh, right, Darcy-Weisbach is for any flow, and since we have the Reynolds number, maybe I should first calculate that to find the friction factor f.

So, first, I need to find the velocity of the fluid in the pipe. The flow rate Q is 40 gal/min. Let me convert that to cubic feet per second (ft³/s) because the other units are in the English system.

Wait, let's see. 1 gallon is approximately 0.133681 ft³. So 40 gal/min is 40 * 0.133681 ft³/min. Then, to get ft³/s, divide by 60.

So, Q = 40 gal/min = 40 * 0.133681 / 60 = (5.34844) / 60 ≈ 0.08914 ft³/s.

Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, 1 ft³ is 7.4805 gallons. So 1 gallon = 1/7.4805 ft³ ≈ 0.13368 ft³. So 40 gal = 40 * 0.13368 ≈ 5.347 ft³. Per minute, so 5.347 ft³/min. To get ft³/s, divide by 60: 5.347 /60 ≈ 0.08912 ft³/s.

The cross-sectional area of the pipe is π*D²/4. But wait, D is in inches, so I need to convert that to feet. 1.61 inches is 1.61/12 = 0.13417 feet.

So, area A = π*(0.13417)^2 /4 ≈ let's compute that.

0.13417 squared is about 0.01799. Multiply by π gives approximately 0.05653, then divide by 4: about 0.01413 ft².

Wait, no, wait, A = π D² /4. Let me compute D in ft: 1.61 in = 1.61/12 = 0.134166667 ft.

So D = 0.134166667 ft.

A = π * (0.134166667)^2 /4.

Compute 0.134166667 squared: (0.134166667)^2 ≈ 0.01799.

Multiply by π: 0.01799 * π ≈ 0.05653.

Divide by 4: 0.05653 /4 ≈ 0.01413 ft².

So, A ≈ 0.01413 ft².

Velocity v is Q/A. So v = 0.08912 ft³/s / 0.01413 ft² ≈ approximately 6.3 ft/s.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

0.08912 / 0.01413 ≈ Let's see: 0.01413 * 6 = 0.08478, which is less than 0.08912. The difference is 0.08912 - 0.08478 = 0.00434. 0.00434 / 0.01413 ≈ 0.307. So about 6.307 ft/s. Let's say approximately 6.31 ft/s.

Now, I need to calculate the Reynolds number (Re) to find the friction factor f.

Re = (ρ * v * D) / μ.

Wait, the units must be consistent. Let's make sure all are in the English system.

Density ρ is given as 53 lb_m/ft³. Wait, no, wait, the problem says "density and viscosity of the fluid flowing at 90°F are 53 lb_m/ft³ and 0.5 cp respectively."

Wait, 53 lb_m per cubic foot. So ρ = 53 lb_m/ft³.

Viscosity μ is 0.5 cp. As I calculated earlier, 0.5 cp is 0.00033598 lb·s/ft².

So Re = (ρ * v * D) / μ.

Plugging in the numbers:

ρ = 53 lb_m/ft³
v ≈ 6.31 ft/s
D ≈ 0.134166667 ft
μ ≈ 0.00033598 lb·s/ft².

So Re = (53 * 6.31 * 0.134166667) / 0.00033598.

Let me compute the numerator first: 53 *6.31 = 53 *6 is 318, 53*0.31≈16.43, so total ≈ 334.43. Then multiply by 0.134166667: 334.43 * 0.134166667 ≈ let's compute 334.43 * 0.13 = 43.4759, and 334.43 * 0.004166667 ≈ 1.392. So total approx 44.8679.

So numerator ≈ 44.8679.

Denominator: 0.00033598.

So Re ≈ 44.8679 / 0.00033598 ≈ Let's compute that.

Dividing 44.8679 by 0.00033598: 44.8679 / 0.00033598 ≈ approximately 133,500.

Wait, because 0.00033598 * 133500 = 0.00033598 * 1e5 is 33.598, and 0.00033598 * 33000 = approx 11.097, so 33.598 + 11.097 ≈ 44.695, which is close to 44.8679. So Re ≈ 133,500. That's in the turbulent flow regime, so the friction factor f can be determined using the Colebrook-White equation or perhaps an approximation like the Moody diagram.

Wait, but for a Re around 1.3e5, and assuming the pipe is steel, which is a common material. But wait, the problem doesn't mention the pipe material. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a smooth pipe? Or maybe we can assume a certain relative roughness.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give the pipe's roughness, so perhaps I should proceed with the assumption of smooth pipe. Alternatively, maybe the pipe's relative roughness is considered negligible, or perhaps it's a copper or PVC pipe, which are smoother.

In the Moody diagram, for a Re of ~1.3e5, and assuming a smooth pipe (ε/D ≈ 0), the friction factor f is around 0.016 to 0.018.

Alternatively, using the Colebrook equation for smooth pipes:

1/sqrt(f) = 2 log(Re * sqrt(f)) - 0.8

But that's a bit tricky without knowing f. Alternatively, for high Re (like Re > 1e5), f can be approximated as 0.0014 * (20000 + Re)^(-1/4) ? No, perhaps a better approach is to remember that for Re between 1e4 and 1e6, f for smooth pipes is approximately 0.016 for Re=1e5, decreasing slightly as Re increases.

Wait, maybe I can use the approximation that for Re between 1e5 and 1e6, f is about 0.017.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to use the formula for f in the turbulent region when the pipe is smooth:

f = 0.0014 + (0.125)/(Re^(1/3))

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Haaland equation, which is an approximation of the Colebrook equation and works for any relative roughness.

The Haaland equation is:

1/sqrt(f) = -0.782 * ln( (ε/(3.7 D)) + (5.74)/(Re * sqrt(f)) )

But since I don't know ε, the roughness, perhaps I should proceed with f=0.017 as an estimate, given that Re is 1.3e5 and assuming a smooth pipe.

Alternatively, perhaps the friction loss is negligible compared to the minor losses, especially since the pipe is quite short (50 ft). Let's think: in many cases, minor losses can be more significant than major losses, especially in short pipes with many fittings.

So maybe the major loss is not the dominant factor here, but I still need to calculate it.

So, the major loss (friction) is:

h_f = (f * L * v²)/(2 * g * D)

But since I need pressure loss, ΔP = h_f * ρ * g.

Wait, because h_f is in feet of liquid, and ΔP = rho * g * h_f.

So, ΔP_friction = (f * L * v² * ρ) / (2 * D)

Wait, let me re-express this correctly.

h_f = (f * L * v^2) / (2 * g * D)

Then, ΔP_friction = rho * g * h_f = rho * g * [f L v^2/(2 g D)] ) → The g cancels out.

So ΔP_friction = (f * L * v² * rho ) / (2 * D )

Alright, so let's calculate that.

But first, I should compute f accurately. Since I estimated Re as ~133,500, and for a smooth pipe, let's check the Moody diagram. At Re=1e5, f is about 0.0168. For Re=2e5, f is about 0.0156. So at 1.3e5, perhaps f is around 0.0165.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find f using the formula for smooth pipes.

Wait, another approach is to use the approximation for f in the turbulent region for smooth pipes as f = 0.0014 + 0.125 * (Re/1e6)^(-0.32)

Wait, perhaps I should use the Colebrook equation. Let me try that.

The Colebrook equation is:

1/sqrt(f) = 2 * log( (ε/(3.7 D)) + (2.51)/(Re * sqrt(f)) )

But without knowing ε, the relative roughness, it's hard to proceed. Maybe I can assume a very small ε/D, so the first term is negligible, which would make the equation:

1/sqrt(f) ≈ 2 * log( (2.51) / (Re * sqrt(f)) )

But this is an iterative equation because f appears on both sides.

Let me assume an initial f, say f_initial = 0.018.

Compute the right-hand side:

RHS = 2 * log( (2.51)/(Re * sqrt(f_initial)) )

Re is 133500, sqrt(f_initial) is sqrt(0.018) ≈ 0.13416.

So denominator: 133500 * 0.13416 ≈ 133500 * 0.13 = 17,355; 133500 * 0.00416 ≈ 555. So total ≈ 17,355 + 555 = 17,910.

So (2.51)/(17910) ≈ approximately 0.0001403.

Then, log(0.0001403) is log(1.403e-4). log(1e-4) is -4, and 1.403 is about 0.147, so log(1.403e-4) ≈ -3.852.

Multiply by 2: 2 * (-3.852) ≈ -7.704.

So 1/sqrt(f_initial) = 1/0.13416 ≈ 7.456.

But according to RHS, it's -7.704. That's not matching, so my initial guess is way off. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe I should use the Moody diagram approach instead. Since without knowing ε, it's hard, but perhaps I can proceed with an approximate f of 0.017.

Let me proceed with f = 0.017 for now.

Now, calculating ΔP_friction:

f = 0.017

L = 50 ft

v = 6.31 ft/s

rho = 53 lb_m/ft³

D = 0.134166667 ft

So ΔP_friction = (0.017 * 50 * (6.31)^2 * 53) / (2 * 0.134166667)

Compute numerator step by step:

0.017 * 50 = 0.85

v squared: 6.31^2 ≈ 39.8

Multiply 0.85 * 39.8 ≈ 33.83

Multiply by 53: 33.83 *53 ≈ let's compute 33*53=1749, 0.83*53≈43.99, so total ≈ 1749 + 43.99=1792.99, approximately 1793.

Denominator: 2 * 0.134166667 ≈ 0.26833333.

So ΔP_friction ≈ 1793 / 0.268333 ≈ let's compute 1793 / 0.2683 ≈ approximately 6683 psi? That can't be right, because that's way too high, and the options are around a few psi. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I missed a conversion somewhere. Let me double-check the units.

Wait, the formula for ΔP is in lb_f/in², so perhaps I missed a conversion from lb_m to lb_f or something. Because the density is given in lb_m/ft³, but pressure is in lb_f/in². So I probably need to use the conversion factor between mass and force.

Ah, right! Because in the English system, weight (force) is mass times g_c, where g_c is 32.174 lb_m·ft/(lb_f·s²).

So, when using ΔP = rho * g * h_f, the rho needs to be in slugs/ft³, where 1 slug = 1 lb_f·s²/ft.

So, I think I made a mistake by not converting rho from lb_m/ft³ to slugs/ft³.

Wait, to convert lb_m to slugs, since 1 slug = 32.174 lb_m, then rho in slugs/ft³ is rho (lb_m/ft³) divided by 32.174.

So, rho = 53 lb_m/ft³ → 53 / 32.174 ≈ 1.647 slugs/ft³.

Ah, that's where I went wrong. I used rho in lb_m/ft³, but it should be in slugs/ft³. So let me correct that.

So, rho = 53 / 32.174 ≈ 1.647 slugs/ft³.

Now, let's recalculate ΔP_friction.

ΔP_friction = (f * L * v² * rho) / (2 * D)

Plugging in the numbers:

f = 0.017

L = 50 ft

v ≈ 6.31 ft/s

rho ≈ 1.647 slugs/ft³

D ≈ 0.134166667 ft

Compute numerator: 0.017 * 50 = 0.85

v^2 = 6.31² ≈ 39.8

So 0.85 * 39.8 ≈ 33.83

Multiply by rho: 33.83 * 1.647 ≈ let's compute 33 *1.647=54.351, 0.83*1.647≈1.368, so total≈54.351+1.368≈55.719.

Multiply by L? Wait, wait, no, the formula already has L as 50 ft, which was included in the 0.85 (0.017 *50=0.85). Oh wait, no, let me re-express:

ΔP_friction = (0.017) * (50) * (6.31)^2 * (1
