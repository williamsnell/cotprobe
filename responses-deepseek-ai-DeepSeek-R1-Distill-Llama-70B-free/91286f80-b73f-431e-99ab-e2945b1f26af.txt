Okay, so I've got this problem here about a dress that's on sale, and I need to figure out the total price after the discount and tax. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

Alright, the original price is $47.50. That's the starting point. The dress is marked down by 30% in a clearance sale. Hmm, so I need to calculate what 30% of $47.50 is and then subtract that from the original price to get the discounted price.

Wait, wait. Let me think. 30% off means the customer pays 70% of the original price, right? Because 100% minus 30% is 70%. Maybe calculating it that way is easier. So, 70% of 47.50. Let me do that calculation.

So, 47.50 multiplied by 0.7. Let me grab a calculator in my head. 47.5 times 0.7. Hmm, 40 times 0.7 is 28, and 7.5 times 0.7 is 5.25. So 28 + 5.25 is 33.25. Oh wait, no, wait. Because 47.50 is 47.5, right? So 47.5 * 0.7. Let me think again. 47 * 0.7 is 32.9, and 0.5 * 0.7 is 0.35. So adding those together, 32.9 + 0.35 = 33.25. So the discounted price is $33.25. 

Wait a second, but I thought the options had something like that. Let me check the options. Option J is $33.25. But wait, the question also says that there's a 6% sales tax paid on the dress. Oh, right, I almost forgot about the tax. So after the discount, we have to add 6% tax on the discounted price.

So the discounted price is $33.25. Now, calculate the tax on that. 6% of 33.25. Let me compute that. 33.25 * 0.06. Hmm, 33 * 0.06 is 1.98, and 0.25 * 0.06 is 0.015. So adding those together, 1.98 + 0.015 is 1.995. Which is approximately $2.00 when rounded. 

Wait, but let me do it more accurately. 33.25 * 6% = (33 + 0.25) * 0.06 = 33*0.06 + 0.25*0.06. 33*0.06 is 1.98, and 0.25*0.06 is 0.015. So total is 1.98 + 0.015 = 1.995. So exactly $1.995, which is $1.995. So when we add that to the discounted price, $33.25 + $1.995 = $35.245. Hmm, but that's a bit tricky because we usually round to two decimal places. So 35.245 becomes $35.25 when rounded to the nearest cent.

Wait, but let me make sure. Because sometimes when you calculate tax, the exact amount is computed. So perhaps I should calculate it more precisely. Let me think again. 33.25 * 1.06 (which includes the tax) is the same as adding 6% tax. So 33.25 * 1.06.

Let me compute that. 33.25 * 1.06. Hmm, 33 * 1.06 is 34.98, and 0.25 *1.06 is 0.265. So 34.98 + 0.265 = 35.245. So yes, the total is $35.245, which is $35.25 when rounded.

Looking back at the options, option F is $35.25. So that would be the answer. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake.

Original price $47.50. Discount is 30%, so the price after discount is 47.50 * 0.7 = 33.25. Then, tax is 6%, so 33.25 * 0.06 = 1.995. Adding 33.25 and 1.995 gives 35.245, which rounds to 35.25. So yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, I could compute it as (47.50 * 0.7) * 1.06. Let's see: 47.50 * 0.7 is 33.25 as before. Then 33.25 * 1.06 is 35.245, which is 35.25.

So the correct total price is $35.25, which is option F.

The original price of the dress is $47.50, and it is marked down by 30%. To calculate the discounted price, we find 70% of the original price (since 100% - 30% = 70%):

\[
47.50 \times 0.7 = 33.25
\]

Next, a 6% sales tax is applied to the discounted price. To calculate the tax:

\[
33.25 \times 0.06 = 1.995
\]

Adding the tax to the discounted price gives the total price:

\[
33.25 + 1.995 = 35.245
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, the total price is $35.25. Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:

**F: $35.25**
