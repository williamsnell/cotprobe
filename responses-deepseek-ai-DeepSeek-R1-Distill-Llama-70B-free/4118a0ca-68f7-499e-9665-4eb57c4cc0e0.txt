Okay, so I've got this problem here about heat loss from a panel. Hmm, let's see. The panel is 3 ft square, so its area is 3x3=9 square feet, right? Oh wait, but the question is asking per square foot, so maybe the area cancels out in calculations, so I don't have to worry about the total area. 

The surface temperature is maintained at 200°F. The surrounding room is at 80°F. The emissivity (epsilon) is 0.9 for the panel. We have two cases: one where the panel is attached to the ceiling facing downward, and another attached to the floor facing upward. 

I think this is a radiation heat transfer problem. The formula for radiative heat transfer is the Stefan-Boltzmann law, right? The formula is Q = εσA(T_surface^4 - T_surroundings^4). But wait, is that all? Because sometimes, when a surface is facing another surface, you have to consider the configuration. Like, if it's facing a much larger surrounding, you can assume the surroundings are at a uniform temperature, which is probably the case here.

Wait, but when you attach the panel to the ceiling facing down, the surroundings would be the rest of the room. Similarly, when it's on the floor facing up, the surroundings are the same. Or does the position affect the calculation? Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe the problem is considering natural convection as well? Because if the panel is hot and facing downward, the air near it might be heated and rise, which could affect the convective heat loss. Alternatively, if it's facing upward, cooler air might come in. But wait, the question says to neglect the conditions through the back of the panel. Oh, so only consider the front side. So I think it's purely radiative heat transfer, no convection involved here because the question doesn't mention it. Or maybe it's a combined effect? Wait, the question doesn't specify, so I'm a bit confused.

Wait, looking back, the question says to calculate the heat lost by the panel. So probably using radiation only, as the problem gives the emissivity and the temperatures. So I should go with the radiative heat transfer formula.

So the formula for heat loss per unit area would be q = εσ(T_surface^4 - T_surroundings^4). The Stefan-Boltzmann constant σ is 0.1714×10^-8 Btu/hr·ft²·°F. Or wait, I think I might have that number wrong. Let me think: in SI units, σ is about 5.67×10^-8 W/m²·K^4, but in imperial units, I think it's approximately 0.1714×10^-8 Btu/hr·ft²·R^4. Oh wait, right, because in Fahrenheit, it's per Rankine, so when using Fahrenheit, you have to convert temperatures to Rankine by adding 459.67.

Wait, so the temperatures here are in Fahrenheit, so I need to convert them to Rankine. T_surface is 200°F, so T1 = 200 + 459.67 = 659.67 R. T_surroundings is 80°F, so T2 = 80 + 459.67 = 539.67 R.

So plugging into the formula, the heat flux q is εσ (T1^4 - T2^4). Let's compute that.

First, compute T1^4 and T2^4. Hmm, let me calculate each step.

T1 = 659.67 R
T1^4 = (659.67)^4. Let me compute that. Alternatively, I can compute it step by step.

But wait, maybe I can find the values using a calculator approach. Alternatively, perhaps approximate.

Wait, I think I should compute 659.67^4 and 539.67^4. Let me think in terms of (T1^4 - T2^4) = (659.67^4 - 539.67^4). But I don't have a calculator here, so maybe I can compute each term.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the difference as (T1^2 + T2^2)(T1 + T2)(T1 - T2). Because a^4 - b^4 = (a² + b²)(a + b)(a - b). Yeah, that might be easier.

So let me compute each factor:

a = T1 = 659.67
b = T2 = 539.67

Compute a - b: 659.67 -539.67 = 120.

a + b = 659.67 +539.67 = 1199.34

a² = (659.67)^2. Let's compute that. 660^2 is 435600, but subtract (0.33)^2 and adjust. Wait, 659.67 is approximately 660 - 0.33. So (660 - 0.33)^2 = 660² - 2*660*0.33 + 0.33² = 435600 - 435.6 + 0.1089 = approx 435600 - 435.6 is 435164.4 + 0.1089=435164.5089.

Similarly, b² = 539.67². Let's approximate 540^2 is 291600. Subtract 0.33 from 540: (540-0.33)^2=540² - 2*540*0.33 +0.33²= 291600 - 356.4 + 0.1089= 291243.7089.

So a² + b² = 435164.5089 + 291243.7089 = 726408.2178.

Now, a^4 - b^4 = (a² + b²)(a + b)(a - b) = 726408.2178 * 1199.34 * 120.

Wait, that's a big number. Let me compute each multiplication step.

First, compute 726408.2178 * 1199.34.

But wait, that's going to be a very large number. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor this as 726408.2178 * 1199.34 = 726408.2178 * (1200 - 0.66) = 726408.2178 *1200 - 726408.2178 *0.66.

Compute 726408.2178 *1200 = 726,408.2178 *1.2e3 = let's see, 726,408 *1000=726,408,000. 726,408 * 200=145,281,600 → total 871,689,600. Then 0.2178 *1200 = 261.36. So total approx 871,689,600 + 261.36 = 871,689,861.36.

Then subtract 726,408.2178 *0.66 = 726,408 *0.66 = let's compute 726,408 *0.6 = 435,844.8 and 726,408 *0.06=43,584.48. So 435,844.8 +43,584.48=479,429.28. Then 0.2178 *0.66= approx 0.1437. So total is about 479,429.28 + 0.1437=479,429.4237.

So subtracting: 871,689,861.36 - 479,429.4237 ≈ 871,210,431.94.

Now multiply this by 120:

871,210,431.94 *120 = 871,210,431.94 *100=87,121,043,194 + 871,210,431.94 *20=17,424,208,638 → total 104,545,251,832.

Wait, that's a huge number. Let me think, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe I should use exponents in terms of thousands.

Wait, but perhaps I can compute the difference in the fourth powers more efficiently. Alternatively, perhaps remembering that the formula for radiative flux is εσ (T1^4 - T2^4), and the units for σ are in Btu/hr·ft²·°R^4. So the calculation would give Btu/hr·ft².

Wait, let me think of the formula again. Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the heat flux q is:

q = ε * σ * (T1^4 - T2^4)

Where:
ε = 0.9
σ = 0.1714e-8 Btu/hr·ft²·°R^4
T1 = 200°F = 659.67 R
T2 = 80°F = 539.67 R

So compute T1^4 and T2^4.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula with the temperatures in F and then using a conversion factor. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, I can compute each term step by step.

Wait, maybe I can use the values in Rankine and calculate each to the fourth power.

Let me compute T1^4:

659.67^4.

Hmm, but without a calculator, this is a bit tough. Alternatively, perhaps I can note that 659.67 R is 200 F, and 539.67 R is 80 F.

Wait, I can compute the ratio of T1 and T2. But perhaps a better approach is to compute each term numerically.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Stefan-Boltzmann formula using converted temperatures.

Wait, let me try computing T1^4 and T2^4 numerically.

Compute T1 = 659.67 R

T1^4 = (659.67)^4.

I can compute this as (660 - 0.33)^4.

But even that is a bit time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the values using a calculator approach.

Wait, perhaps I can compute 659.67^2 first:

659.67 * 659.67. Let me approximate 660^2 is 435600. Then subtract the small part.

But perhaps it's easier to compute 660 * 660 = 435600.

So 659.67 is 660 - 0.33.

So (a - b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b².

So (660 - 0.33)^2 = 660² - 2*660*0.33 + 0.33² = 435600 - 435.6 + 0.1089 = 435600 - 435.6 is 435164.4, plus 0.1089 is 435164.5089.

So that's (659.67)^2 = approx 435164.5089.

Now, (659.67)^4 is (435164.5089)^2. That's a huge number, but let me compute it step by step.

435,164.5089 * 435,164.5089.

Wait, that's about 435,000 squared, which is 1.9e11, but I'm not sure about the exact value. Alternatively, perhaps I can note that 4.351645089e5 squared is (4.351645089)^2 * 1e10.

4.3516^2 is approximately 18.93. So 18.93e10 → 1.893e11.

But I'm not confident in this approach without a calculator. Maybe I should think of another way. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that (a^2 - b^2)(a^2 + b^2) = a^4 - b^4, but that doesn't seem helpful here.

Wait, maybe I can compute the difference as (T1^4 - T2^4) = (659.67^4 - 539.67^4). Let me compute each term.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute T1^4 and T2^4 using exponents.

Wait, another approach: since the problem gives options, maybe I can compute the difference and see which option matches.

Wait, the formula is q = εσ (T1^4 - T2^4).

Given that ε is 0.9, σ is 0.1714e-8.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute T1^4:

T1 = 659.67 R.

Compute 659.67^4:

I know that 600^4 = 1296e8 (since 6^4=1296, so 600^4=1296*(1e2)^4=1296e8=12,960,000,000).

Similarly, 700^4 = 7^4=2401, so 700^4=2401e8=24,010,000,000.

So 659.67 is between 600 and 700, so 659.67^4 would be between 12.96e9 and 24.01e9. Let me compute 660^4.

660^4 = (6.6e2)^4 = (6.6)^4 * 1e8.

6.6^4 is 6.6 * 6.6 = 43.56; 43.56 *6.6= 287.5; 287.5 *6.6≈ 1897.25.

So 6.6^4 ≈ 1897.25 → 660^4 = 1897.25e8 = approx 1.89725e11.

But 659.67 is a little less than 660, so maybe 659.67^4 is approximately 1.896e11.

Similarly, T2 = 539.67 R.

Compute 540^4:

540 = 5.4e2 → (5.4)^4 = 5.4 *5.4=29.16, *5.4=157.464, *5.4≈850.3 → 850.3e8 = 8.503e10.

But 539.67 is slightly less than 540, so 539.67^4 ≈ 8.5e10.

Now, T1^4 - T2^4 ≈ 1.896e11 - 8.5e10 = (1.896 - 0.85) e11 = 1.046e11.

Wait, but 1.896e11 is 18.96e10, so 18.96e10 -8.5e10 = 10.46e10 = 1.046e11.

Now, q = ε * σ * (T1^4 - T2^4) → 0.9 * 0.1714e-8 * 1.046e11.

Compute 0.9 * 0.1714e-8 = 0.15426e-8.

Multiply by 1.046e11: 0.15426e-8 * 1.046e11 = 0.15426 * 1.046 * 1e3.

Because 1e-8 *1e11=1e3.

Compute 0.15426 *1.046 ≈ 0.15426 *1 = 0.15426; 0.15426 *0.046≈0.0071. So total ≈0.16136.

Multiply by 1e3 → 161.36 Btu/hr·ft².

Wait, but looking at the options, the highest value is option F at 330.5, but that's for part (b). Hmm, but wait, let me recheck my calculations because that's not matching any options. Maybe I made a mistake in the T1^4 - T2^4 calculation.

Wait, perhaps my approximation for T1^4 is too low. Let me think again. Since 659.67 is 200 F, and 539.67 is 80 F. Maybe I should compute more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I can use the formula with the exact values.

The formula: q = εσ (T1^4 - T2^4).

Let me compute each part precisely.

Compute T1^4:

T1 = 200°F = 659.67 R.

Compute 659.67^4:

Let me compute 659.67^2 first. 659.67 * 659.67.

= (660 - 0.33)^2 = 660^2 - 2*660*0.33 + 0.33^2.

= 435600 - 435.6 + 0.1089.

= 435600 - 435.6 = 435164.4.

Adding 0.1089: 435164.5089.

So 659.67^2 = 435164.5089 R².

Now, (659.67^2)^2 = (435164.5089)^2.

Compute 435,164.5089 * 435,164.5089.

Hmm, let's approximate 435,000^2 = (4.35e5)^2 = 18.9225e10 = 1.89225e11.

But considering the exact value would be a bit higher due to the 164.5089. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it as (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b², where a=435000, b=164.5089.

So (435000 + 164.5089)^2 = (435000)^2 + 2*435000*164.5089 + (164.5089)^2.

Compute each term:

(435000)^2= 1.89225e11.

2*435000*164.5089= 2*435000=870000; 870000 *164.5089 = ?

Well, 870000 * 160,000 = 139,200,000,000. Wait, no, wait, 870,000 * 164.5089 is:

870,000 * 164 = 142,680,000.

870,000 *0.5089= approx 442,613.

So total ≈142,680,000 + 442,613 = 143,122,613.

Now, (164.5089)^2≈ (164)^2=26896, plus 2*164*0.5089 + (0.5089)^2.

=26896 + 166.5 + 0.259≈27062.76.

So adding all three terms:

1.89225e11 + 143,122,613 + 27,062.76 ≈1.89225e11 + 143,149,675.76.

Wait, 143,149,675.76 is 1.4314967576e8. So 1.89225e11 + 1.4314967576e8 = approximately 1.89225e11 + 0.001431
