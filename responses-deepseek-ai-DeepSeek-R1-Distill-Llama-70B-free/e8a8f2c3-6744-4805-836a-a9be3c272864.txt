Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about auditing and illegal acts. I'm a bit rusty on my auditing concepts, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question asks which discovery during an audit would most likely raise a question about possible illegal acts. The options are A through J. I need to figure out which one is the red flag for potential illegality.

First, I remember that during an audit, the auditor has a responsibility to be aware of any indicators that might suggest illegal acts. These could relate to fraud, non-compliance with laws and regulations, or other unethical activities. So the key here is to identify which option suggests something illegal or non-compliant.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The entity has been consistently late in paying its taxes for the year. Hmm, late tax payments might indicate cash flow problems or poor financial management, but is it necessarily illegal? I think there might be penalties for late payment, but if it's just consistent lateness, it's more about inefficiency than illegality. Unless it's a pattern that suggests they're avoiding taxes, but I'm not sure if this alone is a red flag for illegal acts.

Option B: The entity prepared several large checks payable to cash during the year. Oh, cash transactions can be a big red flag. Large checks to cash could indicate embezzlement, theft, or perhaps even money laundering. Cash is untraceable, so this definitely raises suspicions about possible illegal activities. This seems like a strong candidate.

Option C: The entity has a high turnover rate for its CFO position. High turnover in key positions might indicate poor management or an unstable work environment, but does it point to illegal acts? Maybe if the CFOs are leaving because they discovered something wrong, but without more context, it's not directly indicative of illegality. So probably not the best answer.

Option D: The entity was a campaign contributor to several local political candidates during the year. Political contributions, if legal and properly disclosed, are normal business practices. Unless the contributions are bribes or exceed legal limits, this wouldn't necessarily indicate an illegal act. So probably not D.

Option E: Material internal control weaknesses previously reported to management were not corrected. This is a significant issue because unaddressed control weaknesses can lead to material misstatements in financial statements. It could indicate negligence or even fraud if management is ignoring the issues. This might not directly point to an illegal act, but it's a serious audit concern. I'm not sure if it's the most indicative of illegality, though.

Option F: The entity has made several large donations to non-profit organizations. Large donations could be legitimate charitable contributions. Unless the non-profits are shells for other activities, this doesn't inherently suggest illegality. So probably not F.

Option G: The entity's financial statements show a consistent decrease in revenue over the year. A decrease in revenue could be due to various business reasons like market downturns or increased competition. It's a business performance issue but not necessarily related to illegal acts. So G is unlikely.

Option H: The entity has recently changed its accounting firm multiple times. Changing accounting firms can happen for many reasons, like service issues or cost. While frequent changes might raise some eyebrows, it doesn't directly indicate illegal activities. So H is probably not the answer.

Option I: The entity has a significantly higher expenditure on office supplies than usual. High office expenses could indicate waste or misuse of funds, but unless it's tied to something specific, it's more about operational efficiency. Might not be an illegal act unless, for example, the supplies are being stolen or sold, but that's not directly stated here.

Option J: Related party transactions, although properly disclosed, were pervasive during the year. Related party transactions can be a concern because they may lead to conflicts of interest or fraudulent activities. Even if they're disclosed, if they're pervasive, it might indicate that the company is engaging in transactions that could be detrimental to other stakeholders. But does this necessarily imply illegal acts? It could, but I'm not as sure as I am with option B.

Now, comparing the options, B stands out because large checks to cash can facilitate illegal activities like embezzlement or money laundering. It's a direct indicator of potential fraud. While E is a serious issue, it's more about internal controls and possible misstatements rather than direct illegality. So I think B is the correct answer.

The discovery most likely to raise a question concerning possible illegal acts is **Option B: The entity prepared several large checks payable to cash during the year**. Large cash transactions are a red flag for potential illegal activities such as embezzlement, theft, or money laundering, as cash is untraceable and can facilitate fraudulent behavior. While other options like E (unaddressed internal control weaknesses) and J (pervasive related party transactions) are concerning, they are less directly indicative of illegality compared to the suspicious nature of large cash checks.

Answer: B
