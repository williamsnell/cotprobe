Question:

Third-year student is studying contracts. He has learned that generally all contractual rights may be assigned, but there are some exceptions. Which of the following is not an exception?

Options:

A: An assignment that substantially changes obligor's duty or risk.

C: An assignment that continues the obligor's duty or risk.
D: An assignment that transfers rights to an incapable party.
E: An assignment that causes undue hardship or loss to the obligor.
F: An assignment that reduces the value of the contract to the obligor.
G: An assignment of future rights from future contracts.
H: An assignment that is made without the consent of the other party.
I: An assignment not allowed by law.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this contracts question. Let me start by breaking down what I know. The question is about which option is NOT an exception to the general rule that all contractual rights may be assigned. So, the general rule is that you can assign contractual rights, but there are exceptions where you can't.

I remember that some contracts can't be assigned because it would change the risk or duties of the obligor (the person who has to perform). For example, if I assign a contract where the obligor's duties become significantly different or more burdensome, that might not be allowed. So, let's look at the options.

Option A: Assignment that substantially changes obligor's duty or risk. I think this is an exception because changing the obligor's duties would make it unfair to them. So this is an exception, meaning the assignment isn't allowed. So this is not the correct answer since the question is about which is NOT an exception.

Option B: Changes the nature of the contract. That sounds similar to A. If the assignment changes the nature, like from a service contract to something else, that's probably an exception. So B is an exception, not the answer.

Option C: Assignment that continues the obligor's duty or risk. Wait, so if the assignment doesn't change the duty or risk, maybe that's allowed. So this would not be an exception because the assignment is acceptable. So C might be the correct answer because it's not an exception.

Option D: Transfers to an incapable party. Like if the assignee can't perform or is a minor or something. Assigning to someone who can't take on the obligations might be an exception. So D is an exception, not the answer.

Option E: Causes undue hardship to the obligor. That makes sense as an exception. If the assignment makes things much harder for the obligor, it's not allowed. So E is an exception, not the answer.

Option F: Reduces the value to the obligor. Hmm, maybe this is about the obligee assigning their rights. Like if I'm the obligee and I assign my right to receive payment to someone else, but the obligor's duties remain the same. Wait, but if the assignment reduces the value, does that matter? Or is it more about the nature of the duty? I'm a bit confused here. Maybe F is an exception because it affects the obligor negatively in terms of value, but I'm not entirely sure. I'll have to think more about this.

Option G: Assignment of future rights from future contracts. I remember that you can assign future rights, like in a contract that hasn't been made yet but is expected. So this is generally allowed. So G is not an exception, making it a possible correct answer. Wait, but the question is about which is NOT an exception. So if G is allowed, then it's not an exception. But wait, can you assign future rights? I think the rule is that you can assign future rights as long as they are sufficiently described. So G would not be an exception, making it a possible correct answer.

Option H: Assignment made without consent of the other party. Some contracts require the consent of the obligor for assignment. For example, if the contract says that assignment is not allowed without consent, then it's an exception. So H is an exception, not the answer.

Option I: Assignment not allowed by law. Obviously, if the law prohibits it, it's an exception. So I is an exception, not the answer.

Wait, going back to options C and G. Let me re-examine them. So the question is which is NOT an exception. So the correct answer is the one that is allowed, meaning it's not an exception.

Option C says the assignment continues the obligor's duty or risk. So if the assignment doesn't change the obligor's duties, it's allowed. So C is not an exception, meaning it's the correct answer.

Option G is about assigning future rights. I think that's allowed, so G is also not an exception. Wait, but the options say "assignment of future rights from future contracts." So does that mean the rights don't exist yet? I believe that's possible. Like, you can assign your future rights under a contract that will be entered into later. So G is not an exception, making it a possible correct answer.

Wait, now I'm confused because both C and G seem correct. Let me think again.

The general exceptions to assignment include:

1. Assignment that materially changes the risk or duties of the obligor (so A, B, E, F might be exceptions).
2. Assignment to someone incapable (D).
3. Where the contract prohibits assignment (H).
4. Where assignment is prohibited by law (I).
5. Personal service contracts where the obligor's performance depends on the individual's unique skills (like a famous singer), then assignment is not allowed because it changes the nature.

So, which of the options is not an exception.

Option C: Assignment that continues the obligor's duty or risk. So this is allowed, so C is NOT an exception. So C is a correct answer because it's not an exception.

Option G: Assignment of future rights from future contracts. I think this is allowed. So G is also not an exception. Wait but the question asks which is NOT an exception, so both C and G are possible.

Wait, looking at the options again. The question is which is NOT an exception, so the correct answer is one that is allowed, meaning it's not prohibited.

So the options:

The question is which is not an exception, so the correct answer is an assignment that is allowed.

Looking back, the options:

A: Exception (prohibited)
B: Exception
C: Not exception (allowed)
D: Exception
E: Exception
F: Maybe exception, but I'm not sure.
G: Not exception (allowed)
H: Exception
I: Exception.

So the question is, which of these is not an exception. So the correct answers would be C and G.

Wait, but the available options are A to I, and the correct answer must be one of them. So I need to see which one is the correct answer.

The question is: Which of the following is not an exception?

So, which is allowed.

Looking at option G: Assignment of future rights from future contracts. So, can you assign future rights from contracts not yet made? Yes, I think so. The law allows the assignment of future rights, as long as they are adequately described. So G is allowed, so it's not an exception.

Option C: Assignment that continues the obligor's duty or risk. So if the assignment doesn't change the obligor's duties, it's allowed. So C is not an exception.

Wait, but the options are given as possible exceptions. So the question is, which is not an exception, meaning which is allowed.

So the correct answer would be both C and G, but since only one option is correct, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, the initial options in the question: the options are labeled A to I, and the answer must be one letter.

So, the question is which is not an exception.

So, the correct answer is either C or G.

Wait, let me think again. The main exceptions are when the assignment would materially alter the obligor's duties or risk. So, if the assignment doesn't change that (option C), then it's allowed, so C is not an exception.

Option G: Assignment of future rights. Yes, that's allowed, so G is not an exception.

Wait, but the question gives only one correct answer. So perhaps the intended correct answer is C.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because both C and G are possible. Let me think again.

Wait, the question says "Which of the following is not an exception?"

So, the correct answer is the one that is allowed, meaning it's not an exception.

Looking back, the options:

A: Exception (prohibited)
B: Exception
C: Not exception (allowed)
D: Exception
E: Exception
F: Exception
G: Not exception (allowed)
H: Exception
I: Exception.

So, both C and G are correct? But the options don't have both as correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in understanding option G.

Wait, option G says "assignment of future rights from future contracts." So, does that refer to assigning rights that don't yet exist because the contract hasn't been made yet? Or is it assigning future rights from existing contracts?

Wait, the wording is "future rights from future contracts." So, the rights are in the future, and the contracts are future. So, you can't assign rights from contracts that don't exist yet. Or can you?

I think that the general rule is that you can assign future rights, even from future contracts, as long as they are sufficiently described. So, for example, if I expect to enter into a contract next year, I can assign my rights under that future contract now. So, G is allowed, making it not an exception.

So, the options C and G are both not exceptions. But that can't be because the question expects one answer. Hmm.

Wait, looking back, the question gives us options from A to I, and the correct answer is one of them. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps option C is not an exception. Let's think about the general rule: assignments are allowed unless they materially change the obligor's duties. So, if the assignment doesn't change the duties, it's allowed. So option C is allowed, not an exception.

Option G is allowed, so it's also not an exception.

Wait, but the question only gives one correct answer. So perhaps the intended answer is C, and I'm overcomplicating with G.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is G.

Wait, perhaps the confusion comes from the wording of the options. Let me re-examine each option carefully.

Option C: An assignment that continues the obligor's duty or risk. So, the obligor's duties remain the same, so it's allowed. So, this is not an exception.

Option G: An assignment of future rights from future contracts. As I understand, this is allowed, so it's not an exception.

But the question is which option is not an exception, so both C and G would be correct. But that's impossible because the question expects one answer.

Wait, perhaps the way the options are phrased matters. Let me read them again.

Option A: An assignment that substantially changes obligor's duty or risk. (Exception)

Option B: An assignment that changes the nature of the contract. (Exception)

Option C: An assignment that continues the obligor's duty or risk. (No change, so allowed, not exception)

Option D: Transfer to an incapable party. (Exception)

Option E: Undue hardship. (Exception)

Option F: Reduces value to obligor. (Possibly an exception, but I'm not certain.)

Option G: Assignment of future rights from future contracts. (Allowed, not exception)

Option H: Assignment without consent. (Exception if the contract requires consent)

Option I: Not allowed by law. (Exception)

So, the correct answer should be either C or G. But the options only have one correct answer, so perhaps I'm missing a nuance.

Wait, the question is asking which is NOT an exception. So the correct answer is the one that is allowed, i.e., not prohibited.

So, looking at the options, both C and G describe situations where assignment is allowed.

But in the given options, perhaps the intended correct answer is C. Because G might refer to something else. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is G.

Wait, another approach: the general exceptions include assignments that would change the obligor's duties. So, assignments that don't change duties are allowed, making option C correct as not an exception.

As for option G, perhaps it's allowed, but maybe some jurisdictions don't allow assignments of future rights from future contracts, but I think generally they do, as long as they are described with reasonable specificity.

So, the two options that are not exceptions are C and G.

But since the options only allow for one correct answer, perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, looking back, the question is from a student studying, so perhaps the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the intended answer is G, because the others are more clearly exceptions.

Wait, let me think about the rules again. The main exceptions are when the assignment would materially alter the obligor's risk or duties, assignments to someone incapable, assignments that are prohibited by the contract or law, and perhaps assignments of personal service contracts where the obligor's performance is personal.

So, the fact that option G is about future rights, which are assignable, so G is not an exception.

So, the correct answer would be either C or G.

But the question only gives one correct answer. So perhaps the intended answer is C, because it directly relates to not changing the obligor's duties, which is a key exception.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is G because it's about future rights, which are assignable, so it's not an exception.

Wait, I think I've read that future rights can be assigned. So G is allowed, making it not an exception.

So, if the question is which is NOT an exception, the correct answers would be C and G. But since only one option is correct, perhaps the intended answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is G. I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, looking at the options again, perhaps the answer is G because the other options are all clear exceptions, and G is the only one that's allowed.

So, I'm a bit torn, but I'll go with option C as the correct answer.

To determine which option is **not an exception** to the general rule that contractual rights may be assigned, we analyze each option based on the principle that assignments are allowed unless they materially alter the obligor's duties or risk, or are otherwise prohibited by law or contract.

### Analysis of Each Option:
1. **Option A**: An assignment that substantially changes the obligor's duty or risk is a well-known exception. If the assignment materially alters the obligor's obligations, it is prohibited. **Exception**.

2. **Option B**: An assignment that changes the nature of the contract is also an exception. This often applies to personal service contracts where the obligor's performance depends on unique personal skills or traits. **Exception**.

3. **Option C**: An assignment that continues the obligor's duty or risk does not change the obligor's obligations. Since the assignment does not alter the obligor's duties or risk, it is **not an exception** and is allowed.

4. **Option D**: An assignment that transfers rights to an incapable party is an exception. If the assignee lacks the capacity to perform or take on the obligations, the assignment is prohibited. **Exception**.

5. **Option E**: An assignment that causes undue hardship or loss to the obligor is an exception. If the assignment unfairly burdens the obligor, it is not allowed. **Exception**.

6. **Option F**: An assignment that reduces the value of the contract to the obligor could be considered an exception, as it may indirectly affect the obligor's interests. However, this is less clear and depends on the specific circumstances. **Likely an exception**.

7. **Option G**: An assignment of future rights from future contracts is generally allowed. The law permits the assignment of future rights, provided they are sufficiently described. This is **not an exception**.

8. **Option H**: An assignment made without the consent of the other party is an exception if the contract explicitly requires consent for assignment. **Exception**.

9. **Option I**: An assignment not allowed by law is, by definition, an exception. **Exception**.

### Conclusion:
Both **Option C** and **Option G** describe situations where assignment is allowed and are therefore **not exceptions**. However, since the question requires selecting only one correct answer, **Option C** is the most direct and clear choice, as it directly addresses the continuation of the obligor's duty or risk without any change.
