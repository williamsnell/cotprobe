Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question here with options A through J. I'm a bit new to relations and their properties, but I'll try to work through each option step by step.

The question is asking which statement is true. Let me go through each option one by one.

First, let me recall some key concepts about relations:

A relation R on a set A is called reflexive if every element is related to itself, i.e., for all a in A, (a, a) ∈ R. If even one element doesn't have this, the relation isn't reflexive.

An irreflexive relation is one where no element is related to itself. So, for all a in A, (a, a) ∉ R.

Symmetric means if (a, b) is in R, then (b, a) must also be in R. Anti-symmetric is a bit different; for all a, b, if (a, b) and (b, a) are in R and a ≠ b, then R is not anti-symmetric. Wait, no, actually, for anti-symmetry, if (a, b) and (b, a) are both in R, then a must equal b. So only when a = b can both (a, b) and (b, a) be in R.

An equivalence relation is one that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. A partial order is reflexive, anti-symmetric, and transitive. So, equivalence relations and partial orders are different because one requires symmetry and the other anti-symmetry.

Now, the number of relations from set A to set B: the number is equal to the number of subsets of the Cartesian product A × B. Since each relation is a subset of A × B. The formula is 2^(|A| × |B|).

Let's look at each option:

Option A: Empty relation _ is not reflexive.
Wait, the empty relation is a relation where no elements are related. For reflexivity, all elements must be related to themselves. So if A is non-empty, the empty relation can't be reflexive. But if A is empty, then the empty relation is trivially reflexive, I think. But the option doesn't specify the set. Hmm. Wait, the question probably assumes A is non-empty. So if A has elements, then the empty relation isn't reflexive. So A says it's not reflexive. That would be correct if A is non-empty. But I'm not sure about the specifics here.

Option B: Number of relations from A = {x, y, z} to B = {1, 2, 3} is 64.
The size of A is 3, B is 3. So A × B has 9 elements. The number of subsets is 2^9 = 512. So 64 is 2^6, which doesn't match. So B is wrong.

Option C: Properties of a relation being symmetric and being un-symmetric are positive of each other. I'm not sure what 'positive' means here. Maybe opposites? Or complementary? Wait, 'positive' might not be the right term. Maybe it's a translation issue. Alternatively, perhaps it's saying they are each other's complements. But symmetric and 'un-symmetric' (which I think is the same as not symmetric) are indeed complementary in a sense. But being 'un-symmetric' isn't a standard term. So perhaps this is confusing because a relation can be symmetric, or not symmetric. So C is saying that being symmetric and being un-symmetric are positives, which I'm not sure about. Maybe this is incorrect because a relation can be neither symmetric nor anti-symmetric, but perhaps in some contexts, the terms are used differently.

Option D: Empty relation _ is reflexive. Well, if A is empty, then the empty relation is reflexive because there are no elements to violate reflexivity. But if A is non-empty, like in the earlier example, the empty relation isn't reflexive. But the option doesn't specify, so it's probably not correct in general. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Properties of a relation being symmetric and being un-symmetric are negative of each other. Again, 'negative' is unclear. If 'un-symmetric' means not symmetric, then a relation either is symmetric or isn't. So in that sense, they're opposites. So E could be correct, but I'm not entirely certain because I'm not familiar with 'un-symmetric' being a standard term.

Option F: Number of relations from A = {x, y, z} to B = {1, 2} is 64. The size of A is 3, B is 2, so A×B has 6 elements. The number of subsets is 2^6 = 64. So F is correct. Because 2^6 is 64. So F is a true statement.

Option G: Every equivalence relation is a partial-ordering relation. No, because equivalence relations are symmetric, while partial orders are anti-symmetric. So they can't be the same unless the relation is both symmetric and anti-symmetric, which would only allow relations where a = b if (a, b) is present. So equivalence relations are not partial orders unless very restrictive. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Every partial-ordering relation is an equivalence relation. No, because partial orders are anti-symmetric and equivalence are symmetric. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Number of relations from A = {x, y, z} to B = {1, 2} is 32. Wait, earlier I thought it's 64. Because 3 elements in A, 2 in B, so 6 ordered pairs, 2^6=64. So I is wrong.

Option J: Properties of a relation being symmetric and being anti-symmetric are negative of each other. Hmm, symmetric is when (a, b) implies (b, a). Anti-symmetric is when (a, b) and (b, a) imply a = b. So they're not direct negatives. In fact, a relation can be both symmetric and anti-symmetric only if it's the identity relation (only diagonal elements, like (a,a)). So they're not negatives of each other. So J is incorrect.

So reviewing the options, F is correct. Because from a set of size 3 to a set of size 2, the number of relations is 2^(3×2) = 64.

To determine which statement is true, let's analyze each option based on the properties of relations and related concepts:

- **Option A**: The empty relation is not reflexive. For a non-empty set \( A \), reflexivity requires that every element is related to itself, i.e., \((a, a) \in R\) for all \( a \in A \). The empty relation lacks these pairs, so it is not reflexive. This statement is **true** if \( A \) is non-empty, which is likely assumed here.

- **Option B**: The number of relations from \( A = \{x, y, z\} \) to \( B = \{1, 2, 3\} \) is 64. The Cartesian product \( A \times B \) has \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) elements, and the number of subsets of \( A \times B \) is \( 2^9 = 512 \). Thus, 64 is incorrect. This statement is **false**.

- **Option C**: Properties of a relation being symmetric and being "un-symmetric" are positives of each other. Symmetric means \((a, b) \in R \implies (b, a) \in R\), while "un-symmetric" is not a standard term. If interpreted as "not symmetric," the two properties are complements, not positives. This statement is **false**.

- **Option D**: The empty relation is reflexive. For a non-empty set \( A \), the empty relation cannot be reflexive because it lacks the required pairs \((a, a)\). This statement is **false**.

- **Option E**: Properties of a relation being symmetric and being "un-symmetric" are negatives of each other. If "un-symmetric" means "not symmetric," the two properties are indeed opposites. This statement is **true**.

- **Option F**: The number of relations from \( A = \{x, y, z\} \) to \( B = \{1, 2\} \) is 64. The Cartesian product \( A \times B \) has \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) elements, and the number of subsets is \( 2^6 = 64 \). This statement is **true**.

- **Option G**: Every equivalence relation is a partial-ordering relation. Equivalence relations are symmetric, while partial orders are anti-symmetric. They are distinct unless the relation is trivial. This statement is **false**.

- **Option H**: Every partial-ordering relation is an equivalence relation. Partial orders are anti-symmetric, while equivalence relations are symmetric. This statement is **false**.

- **Option I**: The number of relations from \( A = \{x, y, z\} \) to \( B = \{1, 2\} \) is 32. The correct number is \( 2^6 = 64 \), so this statement is **false**.

- **Option J**: Properties of a relation being symmetric and being anti-symmetric are negatives of each other. Symmetric requires \((a, b) \in R \implies (b, a) \in R\), while anti-symmetric requires \((a, b) \in R \land (b, a) \in R \implies a = b\). These properties are not direct negatives. This statement is **false**.

**Conclusion**: The correct answer is **F**, as the number of relations from \( A = \{x, y, z\} \) to \( B = \{1, 2\} \) is indeed 64.
