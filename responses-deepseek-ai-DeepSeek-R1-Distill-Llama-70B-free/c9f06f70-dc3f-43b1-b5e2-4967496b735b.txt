Question:

A baker made 232 muffins. He sent 190 of the muffins to a local hotel. He will put the rest of the muffins in boxes. Each box can hold 6 muffins. Which equation can be used to find 6, the number of boxes the baker will need?

Options:

A: (232 - 190)x6=b
B: (232 + 190)/6x190=b
C: (232 - 190)x6+190=b
D: (232 - 190)x6/190=b
E: 6/(232 - 190)=b
F: (232 - 190)/6=b
G: (232 x 190)/6=b
H: (232 + 190)x6=b
I: (232 + 190)/6=b
J: (232 x 190)x6=b

Okay, so here's this math problem I'm trying to solve. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's going on.

A baker made 232 muffins. He sent 190 of them to a local hotel. Now, he's going to put the rest of the muffins into boxes. Each box can hold 6 muffins. The question is asking which equation can be used to find 'b', the number of boxes the baker will need.

Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, the baker starts with 232 muffins. He sends away 190. So the number of muffins left is 232 minus 190. Let me calculate that real quick. 232 - 190 is 42. So he has 42 muffins left to box.

Now, each box holds 6 muffins. To find out how many boxes he needs, I think I should divide the remaining muffins by the number each box can hold. So that's 42 divided by 6. 42 ÷ 6 equals 7 boxes. So, the answer should be 7 boxes. But the question isn't asking for the numerical answer; it's asking which equation represents this situation.

Let me look at the options. The options are labeled A to J, each with a different equation. I need to find the one that correctly represents the number of boxes, which is (muffins left) divided by (muffins per box).

So, muffins left is 232 - 190. Muffins per box is 6. So the equation should be (232 - 190) divided by 6 equals b. Let me write that out: (232 - 190)/6 = b.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: (232 - 190)x6=b → That's 42 * 6, which would give 252. That's not the number of boxes needed, so A is wrong.

Option B: (232 + 190)/6x190=b → Adding first, then dividing and multiplying, which complicates things. Not what we need.

Option C: (232 - 190)x6 +190 =b → Again, multiplying, and then adding 190. Doesn't make sense for boxes.

Option D: (232 - 190)x6/190 =b → This is mixing operations, probably not right.

Option E: 6/(232 - 190) =b → That's 6/42, which is 0.142... Not the number of boxes.

Option F: (232 - 190)/6 =b → This is exactly what I thought earlier. 42 divided by 6 is 7, which is correct.

Option G: (232 x 190)/6 =b → Multiplying the two numbers first. 232*190 is a huge number, way more than needed. So wrong.

Option H: (232 +190)x6 =b → Adding and then multiplying, which would give a big number, not boxes.

Option I: (232 +190)/6 =b → Adding first, then dividing. But the total muffins are 232. He sent some away, so we shouldn't be adding.

Option J: (232 x 190)x6 =b → Again, way too big, and incorrect operations.

So the correct equation is option F: (232 - 190)/6 =b.
</think>

The baker starts with 232 muffins and sends 190 to a hotel, leaving 42 muffins. To find the number of boxes needed, divide the remaining muffins by 6. The equation is (232 - 190)/6 = b.

F: (232 - 190)/6 = b

Answer: F
