Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about breast cancer detection methods and which one involves radiation. Hmm, let me think this through.

The question is asking which method exposes the patient to radiation. The options are A through J. I remember that some medical imaging techniques use radiation, while others don't. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A is Biopsy. I think a biopsy involves taking a sample of tissue, right? So that's more of a procedure where they might use a needle or surgery, but I don't think it uses radiation on the patient. Unless it's a guided biopsy, like using X-ray to help take the sample. But the question is about the method itself, not necessarily the guidance. So maybe not A.

Option B is Ductal lavage. I'm not too familiar with that, but I think it's a procedure where they flush out cells from the milk ducts to check for abnormal cells. I don't believe that involves radiation. So B probably isn't the answer.

Option C is Ultrasound. I know ultrasounds use sound waves, not radiation. They're often used during pregnancy as well. So C doesn't involve radiation.

Option D is Physical examination. That's just a doctor feeling the breasts for lumps or abnormalities. No radiation there. So D isn't it.

Option E is Thermography. I think that's using heat sensors to detect temperature variations in the breast tissue. Doesn't use radiation. So E is out.

Option F is Mammography. Oh, right, mammograms are X-rays of the breast. So they definitely use radiation. I've heard that mammograms are the primary screening method and involve compressing the breast between plates to take X-ray images. So F uses radiation.

Option G is Needle aspiration. That's when they use a needle to draw out fluid or tissue, like for testing a cyst. I don't think it uses radiation. Unless again, it's guided, but the method itself doesn't involve radiation. So G isn't the answer.

Option H is Breast MRI. MRI uses magnetic fields and radio waves, not ionizing radiation like X-rays. So H doesn't involve radiation.

Options I and J are Lumpectomy and Mastectomy. Those are surgical procedures to remove part or all of the breast. They're treatments, not detection methods, and they don't involve radiation during the detection phase. Maybe radiation therapy after, but that's a different context.

So putting it all together, the method that uses radiation is mammography, which is option F.

The method of detecting breast cancer that involves exposure to radiation is mammography. Mammography uses X-rays to produce images of the breast tissue, making it the correct answer.

Answer: F
