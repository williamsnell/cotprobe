Okay, so I have this question about the history of the study of social behavior, and I need to choose the correct option from A to J. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that the study of social behavior has evolved over time, right? Like, different periods probably focused on different approaches or methods. I think the earliest period might have been philosophical, where people like Aristotle or Plato thought about society in a more theoretical way. Then, later on, maybe with the Enlightenment, things became more empirical, using statistics and such.

Wait, so perhaps the periods are divided based on the methodologies used. Let me try to break it down:

1. **Philosophical Period**: This would be the earliest, where thinkers used reason and philosophy to understand society. So, ancient Greek philosophers, maybe up through the Middle Ages.

2. **Statistical Period**: I think this came later, maybe during the Enlightenment or Industrial Revolution. People started using data and statistics to analyze social issues. Comte, the father of sociology, comes to mind here, as he emphasized positivism and scientific methods.

3. **Analytical Period**: This might be more modern, where they use more advanced methods, perhaps even computational tools. So, maybe from the 20th century onwards, with the rise of computers and data analysis.

Wait, but some options have more periods. Let me look at the options again.

Option I says three periods: philosophical, statistical, and analytical. That seems to fit what I was thinking. But let me check others.

Option F has four periods: philosophical, statistical, analytical, and modern. Hmm, but I'm not sure what the 'modern' period would entail beyond analytical methods.

Option J has three periods: pre-scientific, scientific, and digital. The digital era is a good point, but I'm not sure if that's a commonly defined period in the study of social behavior.

Option E has seven periods, starting from mythological to computational. That seems too detailed, and I don't think the study is divided into that many.

Option B has five, including post-modern, which I'm not certain about. I think the main shifts are philosophical to statistical to analytical.

So, putting it together, the study likely started with philosophical thought, moved into using statistics and empirical data, and then advanced analytical methods. So three distinct periods: philosophical, statistical, and analytical. That matches option I.

The study of social behavior can be broken down into three main periods based on the methodologies employed:

1. **Philosophical Period**: This was the earliest phase, where thinkers like Aristotle and Plato used philosophical reasoning to understand society. It spanned from ancient times through the Middle Ages.

2. **Statistical Period**: Emerging during the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution, this era saw the introduction of empirical data and statistical analysis, with figures like Auguste Comte influencing the shift toward scientific methods.

3. **Analytical Period**: In the 20th century and beyond, advanced analytical techniques and computational tools became central to studying social behavior, marking a more modern approach.

Option I correctly identifies these three distinct periods.
