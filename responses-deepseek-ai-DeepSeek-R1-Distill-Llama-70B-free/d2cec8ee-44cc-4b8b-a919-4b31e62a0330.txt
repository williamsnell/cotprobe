Okay, so I have this question about the Inuit and their origins based on genetic evidence. Hmm, I remember from my history classes that the Inuit are the indigenous people living in the Arctic regions, like Canada, Alaska, and Greenland. But where did they come from? The question is asking about their descendants, so I need to think about the different groups that might have been their ancestors.

The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Mi'kmaq. I think the Mi'kmaq are an indigenous group living in the eastern parts of Canada, like the Maritimes. They're not Inuit; they belong to a different linguistic and cultural group. So probably not A.

Option B: Norse. The Norse were the Vikings who settled in places like Greenland and Vinland (which is now Canada). There's some history about the Vikings having contact with the Inuit, but I don't think the Inuit are descendants of the Norse. The genetic evidence would show more European influence if that were the case, but the Inuit are more closely related to other Arctic peoples.

Option C: Beothuk. The Beothuk were an indigenous group in Newfoundland, but I believe they're now extinct. They were part of the Beothuk people, but again, I think they were distinct from the Inuit. So C is probably not the right answer.

Option D: Dorset. The Dorset culture refers to an earlier Paleo-Eskimo culture in the Arctic. They were there before the Inuit. I remember that the Dorset people were known for their distinct tools and culture, but the Inuit migrated into their areas later. So the Inuit might have replaced the Dorset people, but are they descendants? I don't think so. They might have had some interaction, but genetically, the Inuit are a separate group.

Option E: Nootka. The Nootka are an indigenous group on the west coast of Canada, like Vancouver Island. They're part of the Wakashan-speaking peoples and are not Inuit. So E is out.

Option F: Clovis. The Clovis culture is one of the earliest known cultures in the Americas, dating back thousands of years. They're associated with big game hunting and the Clovis points. But the Inuit are much more recent, so F doesn't seem right.

Option G: Tuniit. Tuniit... I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think the Tuniit might have been another name for the Dorset people, or perhaps a subgroup. If the Dorset are option D, and Tuniit are G, then maybe G is another way to refer to the same people. But as I thought earlier, the Inuit aren't descendants of the Dorset.

Option H: Vinland. Vinland is the name the Vikings gave to a place they settled in North America, probably around modern-day Canada. So H is more of a place than a people, so it's not the right answer.

Option I: Paleo-Eskimos. Paleo-Eskimos is a broader term that includes various early groups, like the Dorset and others. The Inuit are not Paleo-Eskimos; they came later. So I don't think I is correct.

Option J: Thule. Oh, the Thule people! I remember that the Thule migrated from Alaska across the Arctic regions, displacing the Dorset culture. They were more advanced in terms of technology, like using whalebone for houses and developing the kayak. The modern Inuit are descendants of the Thule people. That makes sense because the Thule migration happened around 1000 AD, moving eastward across Canada and Greenland.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be J: Thule.

The modern Inuit are descendants of the Thule people, who migrated from Alaska across the Arctic regions around 1000 AD, displacing earlier cultures like the Dorset. The Thule were known for their advanced technology and adaptation to the Arctic environment, and their migration laid the foundation for the modern Inuit population.

Answer: J
