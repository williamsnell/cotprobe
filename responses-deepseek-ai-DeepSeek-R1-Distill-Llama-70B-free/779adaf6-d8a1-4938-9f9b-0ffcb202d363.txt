Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the equilibrium constant for a chemical reaction. The reaction given is H₂ + I₂ ⇌ 2HI. They've provided the equilibrium concentrations of each substance: H₂ is 0.9 moles per liter, I₂ is 0.4 moles per liter, and HI is 0.6 moles per liter.

Wait, right, the equilibrium constant K is calculated using the formula K = [products]^coefficients / [reactants]^coefficients. So for this reaction, the products are HI, and the reactants are H₂ and I₂. 

The balanced equation is H₂ + I₂ → 2HI. So the coefficients are 1 for H₂, 1 for I₂, and 2 for HI. So the formula for K should be ( [HI]^2 ) / ( [H₂][I₂] ), because each concentration is raised to the power of its coefficient.

Let me plug in the numbers. The given concentrations are [H₂] = 0.9, [I₂] = 0.4, and [HI] = 0.6.

So substituting into the formula, K = (0.6)^2 / (0.9 * 0.4). Let me compute that step by step.

First, (0.6)^2 is 0.36. Then, the denominator is 0.9 multiplied by 0.4. 0.9 times 0.4 is 0.36. So K = 0.36 / 0.36, which equals 1.0.

Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. 0.6 squared is indeed 0.36. 0.9 times 0.4 is 0.36. So 0.36 divided by 0.36 is 1. So K is 1.0.

Looking at the options, the choice B is 1.0. So the correct answer should be B.

Wait, but just to make sure I didn't mix up the products and reactants. Since the reaction is H₂ + I₂ forming HI, the products are HI, so their concentration is in the numerator. Yes, that's right.

Alternatively, if the reaction was written in reverse, say 2HI ⇌ H₂ + I₂, the K would be the inverse, but in this case, the reaction as given is correct, so we proceed with the initial calculation.

Hmm, another thought: sometimes the units for K are not the same as the concentrations, but I think for this problem, since all concentrations are given in moles per liter and the exponents are correct, the calculation is straightforward.

So yes, the equilibrium constant K is 1.0, which is option B.

To determine the equilibrium constant \( K \) for the reaction \( \text{H}_2 + \text{I}_2 \rightleftharpoons 2\text{HI} \), we use the formula:

\[
K = \frac{[\text{HI}]^2}{[\text{H}_2][\text{I}_2]}
\]

The equilibrium concentrations are given as:
- \([\text{H}_2] = 0.9 \, \text{M}\),
- \([\text{I}_2] = 0.4 \, \text{M}\),
- \([\text{HI}] = 0.6 \, \text{M}\).

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
K = \frac{(0.6)^2}{(0.9)(0.4)} = \frac{0.36}{0.36} = 1.0
\]

Thus, the equilibrium constant \( K \) is 1.0. Comparing this result with the provided options, the correct answer is:

**B: 1.0**
