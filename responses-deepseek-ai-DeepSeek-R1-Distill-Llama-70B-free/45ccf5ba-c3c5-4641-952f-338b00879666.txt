Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about Word2Vec and activation functions. Let's see what it's asking.

The question has two statements. Statement 1 says that Word2Vec parameters were not initialized using a Restricted Boltzmann Machine. Statement 2 claims that the tanh function is a nonlinear activation function. I need to determine if each statement is true or false and then choose the correct option from A to D.

Starting with Statement 1: Word2Vec and RBM. I remember that Word2Vec is a technique for creating word embeddings. There are two main architectures, CBOW and Skip-Gram. I think Word2Vec uses neural networks but not RBMs. RBMs are part of another approach, like maybe WordNet or something else. Wait, RBMs are used in things like DBNs (Deep Belief Networks), but Word2Vec uses shallow neural networks. So Word2Vec's parameters aren't initialized with RBMs. So Statement 1 is True.

Now Statement 2: Tanh as a nonlinear activation function. Tanh, or hyperbolic tangent, is definitely a nonlinear function. It maps inputs to values between -1 and 1. Nonlinear because it's not a straight line; it's S-shaped. So yes, Statement 2 is True.

So both statements are True. Looking at the options, option D is True, True. So the answer should be D.

Statement 1 is true because Word2Vec does not use Restricted Boltzmann Machines for parameter initialization. Statement 2 is also true as the tanh function is nonlinear. 

Answer: D
