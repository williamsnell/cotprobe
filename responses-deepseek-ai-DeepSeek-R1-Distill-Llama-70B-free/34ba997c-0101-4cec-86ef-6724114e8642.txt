Okay, so I have this question about the spin quantum number of electrons in the ground state of neutral nitrogen. Hmm, I remember from my chemistry class that the spin quantum number has to do with the electrons' spin. Oh wait, spin is a form of angular momentum, right?

The question is asking for the total spin quantum number. Wait, does that mean the sum of the individual spins of all the electrons? Or is it something else? Oh right, the total spin quantum number is S, and the spin multiplicity is 2S + 1. But here, they're directly asking for S, the total spin.

Nitrogen has an atomic number Z of 7, so it's neutral, meaning it has 7 electrons. I need to write out the electron configuration for nitrogen in its ground state. Let me think, the order of filling is based on the Aufbau principle. So filling up electrons in order of increasing energy levels.

The ground state configuration for nitrogen would be 1s² 2s² 2p³. Oh wait, because after the s orbitals (which hold 2 electrons each), the p orbitals come next. For p, each can hold up to 6 electrons, but since nitrogen is in period 2, it's 2p³.

Now, the 2p orbital has three electrons. Each p orbital can hold a maximum of 2 electrons, one with spin up and one with spin down. So in the p³ case, each of the three p orbitals (px, py, pz) has one electron each. Because according to Hund's rule, electrons will fill each orbital singly before pairing up. So each of the three p electrons is in a separate orbital with parallel spins.

Wait, so each electron has a spin of 1/2. Since all three are unpaired and their spins are aligned (because Hund's rule says maximum multiplicity), their spins would add up.

So the total spin S is the sum of each individual spin. Since all spins are in the same direction, I can just add them. Each is 1/2, so 3 * 1/2 = 3/2. Oh wait, but wait a minute. Spin is a vector quantity, so when you add them, you have to consider the right way to add. But in the case of all spins being parallel, the maximum total spin is when they all add up.

So for three electrons each with s = 1/2, maximum S is (1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2) = 3/2. So the total spin quantum number S is 3/2. But wait, the multiplicity is 2S+1, which would be 2*(3/2)+1 = 4. So the multiplicity is 4, but that's not what the question is asking.

The question is asking for the total spin quantum number, which is S. So S is 3/2. Looking at the options, let me check:

Options are:

A:1

B:5/2

C:3

D:2

E:4 1/2

F:1/2

G:0

H:2 1/2

I:4

J:3/2

So option J is 3/2. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I'm not confusing total spin with anything else. Some sources might calculate the total spin as the vector sum, but in this case, all the electrons are unpaired and spins are parallel, so the total spin is indeed 3*(1/2) = 3/2.

Another way to think about it: each unpaired electron contributes 1/2 to the total spin. Since there are three unpaired electrons, 3*(1/2) = 3/2.

So yeah, I'm confident the answer is J.

To determine the total spin quantum number \( S \) of the electrons in the ground state of neutral nitrogen (\( Z = 7 \)), we start by writing its electron configuration. Neutral nitrogen has 7 electrons, and the ground state configuration is \( 1s^2 2s^2 2p^3 \). The \( 2p \) orbital contains three electrons, and according to Hund's rule, these electrons will occupy the three degenerate \( p \)-orbitals (\( p_x, p_y, p_z \)) singly, with their spins aligned (parallel) to maximize multiplicity.

Each electron has a spin quantum number \( s = \frac{1}{2} \). Since all three electrons in the \( 2p \) orbital are unpaired and their spins are aligned, the total spin quantum number \( S \) is calculated as:

\[
S = s_1 + s_2 + s_3 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2}.
\]

Thus, the total spin quantum number \( S \) for the electrons in the ground state of neutral nitrogen is \( \frac{3}{2} \).

From the given options:

- **A: 1**
- **B: \( \frac{5}{2} \)**
- **C: 3**
- **D: 2**
- **E: \( \frac{9}{2} \)**
- **F: \( \frac{1}{2} \)**
- **G: 0**
- **H: \( \frac{5}{2} \)**
- **I: 4**
- **J: \( \frac{3}{2} \)**

The correct answer is **J: \( \frac{3}{2} \)**.
