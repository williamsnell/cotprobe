Question:

A medical research team tests for tumor reduction in a sample of patients using three different dosages of an experimental cancer drug. Which of the following is true?

Options:

A: There are three levels of a single explanatory variable.
B: There are three explanatory variables and one response variable.
C: There is one explanatory variable with three levels of response.
D: There is one explanatory variable and three corresponding response variables.
E: There are three separate explanatory variables, each with a single level of response.
F: There are three response variables and one explanatory variable.
G: Tumor reduction is the only response variable, but there are three explanatory variables corresponding to the different dosages.
H: Tumor reduction is the only explanatory variable, but there are three response variables corresponding to the different dosages.
I: There are three response variables, each corresponding to a different level of a single explanatory variable.
J: There is one response variable with three levels of explanation.

Okay, so I have this question about a medical research study, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's take it step by step. 

The question says a team is testing tumor reduction in patients using three different dosages of an experimental cancer drug. I'm supposed to determine which of the options A through J is correct based on that scenario.

Hmm, I remember that in experiments, there are explanatory variables and response variables. The explanatory variable is what the researchers are changing or applying to see if it affects something. The response variable is what they measure as a result.

In this case, the drug's dosage is being varied. So the three different dosages are the explanatory variable. That makes sense because the researchers are probably testing if higher dosages lead to more tumor reduction. So the explanatory variable is the dosage, and it has three levels: low, medium, and high, perhaps.

The response variable here is tumor reduction. They're measuring how much the tumor size decreases, right? So there's only one response variable measured across all the different dosage groups.

Wait, so looking at the options, I need to find the one that says there's one explanatory variable with three levels and one response variable.

Looking at each option:

Option A: Three levels of a single explanatory variable. That fits because dosage is the single variable with three levels. So this could be correct.

Option B: Three explanatory variables and one response. No, because the only variable they're changing is dosage, so only one explanatory variable.

Option C: One explanatory variable and three levels of response. No, because the response is tumor reduction, which is a single variable measured, not three.

Option D: One explanatory variable and three response variables. No, the response is one variable, tumor reduction, not three.

Option E: Three separate explanatory variables. That's not right because they're just varying the dosage.

Option F: Three response variables and one explanatory. No, again, only one response variable.

Option G: Tumor reduction is the response, three explanatory variables (like different drugs maybe). No, because it's one drug with different dosages, so only one explanatory variable.

Option H: Tumor reduction as the explanatory variable? That doesn't make sense. They're measuring it as the outcome.

Option I: Three response variables, each for a level of one explanatory. No, only one response variable.

Option J: One response variable with three levels of explanation. Hmm, not sure. The explanatory variable has three levels, so maybe. But wait, the response is a single variable, so this might be mixing things.

Wait, let me clarify. The explanatory variable is dosage, which has three levels. The response is tumor reduction, which is one variable. So the correct setup is: one explanatory variable with three levels (dosage levels) and one response variable (tumor reduction).

Looking again, option A says "three levels of a single explanatory variable." So that's correct in terms of the explanatory part. But what about the response? The question is about the setup, which includes both variables.

Wait, the question is asking which statement is true about the setup. So the correct option should mention one explanatory variable with three levels and one response variable.

Looking at the options again, option A only mentions the explanatory variable, not the response. Do any options mention both?

Option G says tumor reduction is the only response variable (so one response variable), and three explanatory variables. But that's incorrect because dosage is a single variable with three levels, not three separate variables.

Option I says three response variables, which is wrong.

Wait, perhaps none of the options mention both correctly. Let me re-examine each option.

Option A: "There are three levels of a single explanatory variable." Does this imply that the response is something else? I think this is correct because the explanatory variable is the dosage with three levels. The response is tumor reduction, which is a single variable.

Option J: "One response variable with three levels of explanation." Hmm, that wording is a bit off. The response doesn't have levels of explanation; the explanatory variable has levels. So J might be incorrect.

Wait, so the correct answer is A? Because it correctly states that there's one explanatory variable with three levels, which fits the dosage. And the response is implied to be the tumor reduction, which is a single variable.

So the correct answer would be A.

The question involves a medical research study testing tumor reduction in patients using three different dosages of an experimental cancer drug. In this context, the dosage is the explanatory variable, which has three levels (low, medium, high), and tumor reduction is the single response variable being measured.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Correctly states that there are three levels of a single explanatory variable (dosage). This aligns with the study's design.
- **Option B**: Incorrect because there is only one explanatory variable (dosage), not three.
- **Option C**: Incorrect because the response variable (tumor reduction) is a single variable, not three levels.
- **Option D**: Incorrect because there is only one response variable, not three.
- **Option E**: Incorrect because there is one explanatory variable (dosage), not three separate ones.
- **Option F**: Incorrect because there is only one response variable, not three.
- **Option G**: Incorrect because there is one explanatory variable (dosage), not three.
- **Option H**: Incorrect because tumor reduction is the response variable, not the explanatory variable.
- **Option I**: Incorrect because there is only one response variable, not three.
- **Option J**: Incorrect because the wording is misleading; the response variable does not have "levels of explanation."

The correct answer is **Option A**, as it accurately describes the study's design with one explanatory variable (dosage) having three levels.

Answer: A
