Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about mirrors. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about an individual using a concave mirror to view his face. The mirror is 20 cm away from his face, and he wants the image to be 40 cm from the mirror. I need to find the radius of curvature, focal length, and the magnification.

Wait, I remember that concave mirrors can form both real and virtual images depending on where the object is placed. Since the person is looking at their face, the image is probably virtual, right? Because with concave mirrors, when the object is within the focal length, the image is virtual and upright.

So first, let's get the given values straight. The object distance, which is the distance from the object (his face) to the mirror, is given as 20 cm. So u = 20 cm. The image distance, v, is 40 cm. Wait, but wait, in mirror equations, the sign conventions matter. For concave mirrors, the focal length is positive.

Mirror formula is 1/f = 1/v + 1/u. Oh wait, no, the correct formula is 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. Or is it 1/f = 1/v + 1/u? Wait, no, I think it's 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. No, wait, I think I might have that backwards. Let me think. Oh right, the mirror formula is 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. But wait, wait, no, it's 1/f = 1/v + 1/u. Oh wait, no, no, the correct formula is 1/f = 1/v + 1/u, but I get confused sometimes because different sources might present it differently. Wait, no, I think the correct formula is 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, I think it's 1/f = 1/v + 1/u. Because when the object is at infinity, the image is at f. So if u is infinity, 1/u is zero, so 1/f = 1/v, so v would be f. That makes sense. So yes, the formula is 1/f = 1/v + 1/u.

But wait, wait. Let me get this right. The standard mirror formula is 1/f = 1/u + 1/v, but sometimes I've seen it written as 1/f = 1/v + 1/u. Oh, wait, same thing. So addition is commutative. So the order doesn't matter. So 1/f is the sum of 1/u and 1/v.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me make sure. Oh yeah, the correct formula is 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. So u is the object distance, v is the image distance.

So plugging in the numbers: u is 20 cm, v is 40 cm.

So 1/f = (1/20) + (1/40). Let's calculate that. 1/20 is 0.05, 1/40 is 0.025. Adding them gives 0.075. So 1/f = 0.075, so f = 1 / 0.075 = approximately 13.333 cm. Wait, that can't be right because the options don't have 13.33 cm as the focal length. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, wait a second. The problem says the mirror is 20 cm from the face. So u is 20 cm. The image is 40 cm from the mirror, so v is 40 cm. But wait, in mirror conventions, the object distance is u, and the image distance is v. But for concave mirrors, the focal length is positive. So the formula is 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. So 1/f = (1/20) + (1/40) = (2 +1)/40 = 3/40. So f = 40/3 ≈13.33 cm. But none of the options have this. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, maybe I got u and v wrong. Because if the person is looking at the image, which is behind the mirror, then the image distance would be negative? Wait, no, the mirror equation uses signs based on the Cartesian convention. In that case, for concave mirrors, the focal length is positive. The object distance u is positive if it's in front of the mirror. The image distance v is positive if it's real (in front), negative if virtual (behind the mirror).

Wait, wait, this might be the mistake. Because if the image is virtual, then v is negative. So in the given problem, the image is formed 40 cm from the mirror, but is it in front or behind? Since the person is using a concave mirror as a magnifying mirror, which typically forms a virtual image behind the mirror when the object is within the focal length.

So, if the image is virtual, then v should be negative. So in this case, v is -40 cm.

So let's recalculate with v = -40 cm.

So 1/f = 1/u + 1/v = 1/20 + 1/(-40) = (1/20) - (1/40) = (2/40 -1/40) )= 1/40. So 1/f = 1/40 → f =40 cm. Wait, that can't be right because that would make the radius of curvature 80 cm.

Wait wait, no. Because the radius of curvature R is twice the focal length. So if f is 20 cm, R is 40 cm. Or if f is 40 cm, R is 80 cm.

Wait, but according to this calculation, 1/f = 1/40 → f=40 cm. So R would be 80 cm.

Wait, but let me make sure. So u = 20 cm (positive, because object is in front). v = -40 cm (negative, because image is behind the mirror).

So 1/f = (1/20) + (1/-40) = (2 -1)/40 = 1/40 → f =40 cm. So R = 2f =80 cm.

So the focal length is 40 cm, radius of curvature 80 cm.

Now, the magnification m is given by m = -v/u. So v is -40 cm, u is 20. So m = - ( (-40) ) /20 = 40/20 = 2. So magnification is 2.

Looking at the options, which one matches R=80 cm, f=40 cm, m=2? Let's see.

Option H: Radius 80, Focal 40, Magnification 2. So that's option H.

Alternatively, let me check other options. Option D: Radius 80, Focal 40, Magnification 3. No, because m here is 2. Option H matches.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes signs can be tricky.

So u =20 cm (positive), v =-40 cm (because virtual image). So mirror equation:

1/f = 1/v + 1/u → 1/f = (1/-40) + (1/20) = (-1 + 2)/40 = 1/40 → f=40 cm. Correct.

Magnification m = -v/u → m= - ( (-40) ) /20 → 40/20=2. So m=2, which is positive, meaning image is upright, which makes sense for a virtual image in a concave mirror.

So R =2f=80 cm. So the correct choice is option H. Checking the options:

Option H: Radius 80 cm, Focal 40 cm, Magnification 2. So yes, that's correct.

To solve the problem, we use the mirror equation and the magnification formula. The given values are:

- Object distance, \( u = 20 \, \text{cm} \) (positive, as the object is in front of the mirror).
- Image distance, \( v = -40 \, \text{cm} \) (negative, as the image is virtual and behind the mirror).

### Step 1: Mirror Equation
The mirror equation is:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{20} + \frac{1}{-40} = \frac{2}{40} - \frac{1}{40} = \frac{1}{40}
\]

Thus:

\[
f = 40 \, \text{cm}
\]

### Step 2: Radius of Curvature
The radius of curvature \( R \) is related to the focal length \( f \) by:

\[
R = 2f
\]

Substituting \( f = 40 \, \text{cm} \):

\[
R = 2 \times 40 = 80 \, \text{cm}
\]

### Step 3: Magnification
The magnification \( m \) is given by:

\[
m = -\frac{v}{u}
\]

Substituting \( v = -40 \, \text{cm} \) and \( u = 20 \, \text{cm} \):

\[
m = -\frac{-40}{20} = \frac{40}{20} = 2
\]

### Final Answer
The radius of curvature is \( 80 \, \text{cm} \), the focal length is \( 40 \, \text{cm} \), and the magnification is \( 2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**H: Radius of curvature: 80 cm, Focal length: 40 cm, Magnification: 2**
