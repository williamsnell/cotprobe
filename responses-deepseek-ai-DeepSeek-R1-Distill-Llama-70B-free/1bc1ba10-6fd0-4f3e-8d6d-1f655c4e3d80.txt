Question:

A husband and his passenger were killed in an auto collision involving a defendant. The husband's wife now brings an action to recover damages for loss of society and companionship. The wife testified that she and her husband had a close relationship and that they were happily married for over 15 years. Then on cross-examination, defendant's counsel asked her if she "was aware of the affair that her husband was having with his passenger?"The wife's attorney immediately objected to this question. The judge should rule that the question is

Options:

A: objectionable, because it is irrelevant to the case at hand.
B: unobjectionable, because it could potentially influence the jury's perception of the wife's claim.
C: objectionable, because it could be seen as an attempt to tarnish the reputation of the deceased.
D: objectionable, because it was highly prejudicial.
E: unobjectionable, because it was relevant on the issue of negligence.
F: unobjectionable, because plaintiff's knowledge of such an affair was probative of the value to be placed on her loss.
G: objectionable, because the question is beyond the scope of direct examination.
H: objectionable, because it infringes on the privacy of the deceased.
I: unobjectionable, because it provides a potential motive for the accident.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence question for my law studies. Let's see what the question is about.

The scenario is that a husband and his passenger were killed in a car accident. The wife is suing to recover damages for loss of society and companionship. She testified that they had a close, happy marriage of over 15 years. Then on cross-examination, the defendant's lawyer asks if she knew about an affair her husband was having with the passenger. Her attorney objected, and now we need to decide if the judge should overrule or sustain the objection.

Hmm, I remember that in tort cases, especially wrongful death, the plaintiff can recover for loss of companionship and society. But I also recall that certain evidence is inadmissible if it's irrelevant or prejudicial.

So the question here is about the admissibility of the affair. Why would the defendant bring this up? Maybe to suggest that the marriage wasn't as good as the wife claims, which would reduce the damages because the loss isn't as significant if they weren't close. But is that relevant?

Wait, evidence is relevant if it tends to make a fact of consequence more or less probable. Here, the fact is the value of the wife's loss. If the marriage was troubled, maybe the loss of companionship isn't as great. So the affair could be relevant to the damages.

But then again, there's the issue of prejudice. The mention of an affair could be very prejudicial against the deceased, making the jury think less of him and maybe affecting their judgment on the wife's claim. But the affair's relevance is about the state of the marriage, which directly relates to the damages claimed.

I also remember something about the "eggshell plaintiff" rule, but that's more about the plaintiff's condition before an injury. Not sure if that applies here.

Another point is whether the affair is within the scope of direct. On direct, the wife testified about their close relationship. So on cross, the defendant can ask about things that would contradict that testimony. So the affair is within the scope because it challenges the closeness of the marriage.

But wait, is the affair's existence probative? If the husband was having an affair, does that mean the marriage was unhappy? Maybe, but it's possible the wife didn't know, so her testimony was truthful. But if she did know, it might show the marriage was troubled.

Alternatively, maybe the question is trying to impeach the wife's credibility by suggesting she's lying about their happy marriage. But if she didn't know about the affair, then her testimony is still truthful, so the affair wouldn't necessarily impeach her.

I'm a bit torn. On one hand, the affair could be relevant to show the marriage wasn't as strong as claimed, thus reducing damages. On the other hand, bringing up an affair could be highly prejudicial, especially if the jury might hold it against the deceased or the wife.

Wait, the options are about whether the question is objectionable or not. Let me look at the options again.

Option A says it's objectionable because irrelevant. But I think it's relevant because it goes to the value of the loss. So A might not be correct.

Option B says it's unobjectionable because it could influence the jury's perception of the wife's claim. That seems to align with the idea that the affair affects the damages calculation.

Option C says it's objectionable because it tarnishes the deceased's reputation. But evidence about a person's character can sometimes be admissible, especially if it's relevant. Though I'm not sure if this is a character evidence issue.

Option D says it's objectionable because it's highly prejudicial. Prejudice is a concern, but if the evidence is relevant, sometimes it's allowed despite being prejudicial, unless the prejudice outweighs the probative value.

Option E says it's unobjectionable because relevant to negligence. Wait, the question is about loss of companionship, not about who was negligent. So E seems off.

Option F says it's unobjectionable because the plaintiff's knowledge of the affair affects the value of loss. That makes sense because if she knew, maybe the marriage was troubled, reducing her loss. But if she didn't know, it's a different story.

Option G says objectionable because beyond the scope of direct. But on direct, the wife testified about their close relationship. So cross can challenge that, making the affair within scope. So G might not be the right reason.

Option H says objectionable because it infringes on the deceased's privacy. Privacy isn't a major concern in evidence law in this context, especially in a civil trial where the deceased's actions might be relevant.

Option I says unobjectionable because it provides a motive for the accident. I don't see how the affair gives a motive for the accident. It might relate to the husband's behavior, but not directly to the accident's cause.

So, considering all this, I think the affair is relevant because it could impact the damages. Therefore, the question might be unobjectionable. But wait, is there a rule against introducing specific instances of conduct to prove character? Like, under FRE 405, character evidence is usually not allowed except in certain cases.

Wait, in this case, the defendant isn't trying to prove the husband's character, but rather the state of the marriage. The affair is about the relationship, not the husband's character per se. So it's more about the circumstances of the marriage than the husband's character traits.

Also, FRE 412 deals with evidence of a victim's sexual behavior, but that's usually in criminal cases, especially sexual assault. Not sure if that applies here.

So, if the affair is relevant to the damages, then the question is unobjectionable. So looking back at the options, F says it's unobjectionable because plaintiff's knowledge is probative of the loss's value. That seems correct.

Wait, but does the wife's knowledge matter? If she didn't know about the affair, then her testimony about a happy marriage stands. But if she did, maybe the marriage was troubled. So the question is whether she knew, which could affect the damages. So the question is relevant.

Therefore, the correct ruling would be that the question is unobjectionable because it's relevant to the issue of damages. So option F.

The question revolves around the admissibility of evidence regarding an alleged affair between the deceased husband and his passenger in a wrongful death case where the plaintiff (the wife) seeks damages for loss of society and companionship. The wife testified to a close and happy marriage, and the defendant's counsel asked on cross-examination whether she knew about the affair. The issue is whether this question is objectionable or not.

Relevant evidence is defined as evidence that tends to make a fact of consequence more or less probable. Here, the affair could be relevant because it might impact the calculation of damages by suggesting the marriage was not as strong as claimed, thereby reducing the value of the loss of companionship. However, the question also raises concerns about prejudice, as introducing the affair could unfairly tarnish the deceased's reputation or influence the jury's perception of the wife's claim.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The affair is not irrelevant; it could be probative of the marriage's quality and thus relevant to damages.
- **Option B**: Plausible. The affair could influence the jury's perception of the wife's claim by suggesting the marriage was troubled, but this does not necessarily make it unobjectionable.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. While the affair might tarnish the deceased's reputation, this is not the primary basis for exclusion under evidence rules.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. While prejudice is a concern, the affair's relevance to damages likely outweighs its prejudicial impact.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The affair is unrelated to the issue of negligence.
- **Option F**: Correct. The plaintiff's knowledge of the affair is probative of the value of the loss of companionship, as it could indicate the marriage was troubled, thereby reducing damages.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The affair is within the scope of cross-examination because it directly challenges the wife's testimony about the marriage.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. Privacy concerns are not a primary basis for exclusion in this context.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The affair does not provide a motive for the accident.

The most accurate ruling is that the question is unobjectionable because the plaintiff's knowledge of the affair is relevant to the value of the loss of companionship.
