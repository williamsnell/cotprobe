Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to break it down step by step. The question is about a function f(x) whose graph, when shifted and stretched, remains the same. Hmm, interesting.

So the problem says that when the graph of f(x) is shifted 2 units to the right and stretched vertically by a factor of 2, the resulting figure is identical to the original graph. Oh right, so after these transformations, it looks the same as before. That must mean the function has some kind of periodicity or a specific form that makes it invariant under these changes.

Let me think about what shifting and stretching does to a function. Shifting a graph 2 units to the right would replace x with (x-2) in the function. So f(x) becomes f(x-2). Then, stretching vertically by a factor of 2 would multiply the function by 2, making it 2*f(x-2). So the transformed function is 2*f(x-2).

But wait, the problem states that after these transformations, the graph is identical to the original. That means for all x, 2*f(x-2) = f(x). So the equation we get is:

2*f(x - 2) = f(x)

This looks like a functional equation. I remember that functional equations often describe functions with exponential behavior because they can have properties where scaling and shifting lead to similar forms.

Let me write this equation more clearly:

f(x) = 2 * f(x - 2)

This suggests that every time x increases by 2, the function's value doubles. Oh, so this is a kind of recursive relation. Let me see: for each step of 2 in x, f multiplies by 2. So f(x) is an exponential function, perhaps of the form f(x) = A * (2)^(x/2), where A is a constant. Wait, because if each step of 2 in x (each step of 2) multiplies f by 2, then the base would be 2^(x/2), since each 2 units correspond to a multiplication by 2.

But let me test this. Let's suppose f(x) = A * (2)^(x/2). Then f(x-2) would be A * (2)^((x-2)/2) = A * 2^(x/2 -1) ) = A * 2^(x/2) * 2^(-1) ) = f(x) * (1/2). Then 2*f(x-2) would be 2*(f(x)/2) ) = f(x). So yes, that works. So the general form is f(x) = A * 2^(x/2) = A * sqrt(2)^x. Alternatively, since 2^(x/2) is the same as sqrt(2)^x.

But wait, another approach: maybe f(x) = A * e^(k x). Let's plug into the equation f(x) = 2 f(x-2). Then:

A e^(k x) = 2 A e^(k(x-2)) )

Divide both sides by A e^(k(x-2)):

e^(2k) = 2

So 2k = ln(2), so k = (ln 2)/2. So f(x) = A e^{(ln2/2) x} = A (e^{ln2})^{x/2} ) = A 2^{x/2}, which is the same as before.

So f(x) is an exponential function with base sqrt(2) or 2^{1/2}.

Now, the problem gives us a specific value: f(0) = 0.1. Let's use that to find A. At x=0:

f(0) = A * 2^(0/2) = A * 1 = A. So A = 0.1.

Therefore, the function is f(x) = 0.1 * (2)^(x/2).

Now, the question is asking for f(10). Let me compute that.

f(10) = 0.1 * 2^(10/2) = 0.1 * 2^5.

2^5 is 32, so 0.1 *32 is 3.2.

Wait, but let me double-check. 2^5 is indeed 32. 0.1 times 32 is 3.2. So f(10) =3.2.

Looking at the options, option C is 3.2, so the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the function's form. Because the functional equation is f(x) = 2 f(x-2), which suggests that each step of 2 in x doubles the function. So for x=0, f(0)=0.1.

Then for x=2, f(2)=2*f(0)=0.2. x=4: f(4)=2*f(2)=0.4. x=6: 0.8, x=8:1.6, x=10:3.2. So yes, f(10)=3.2, which matches option C.

So I think the correct answer is C.

The problem involves a function \( f(x) \) whose graph remains unchanged when shifted 2 units to the right and stretched vertically by a factor of 2. This implies the functional equation:

\[
f(x) = 2 \cdot f(x - 2)
\]

This indicates that the function doubles in value every 2 units along the \( x \)-axis, suggesting an exponential form. Solving the functional equation, we find that \( f(x) \) can be expressed as:

\[
f(x) = A \cdot 2^{x/2}
\]

where \( A \) is a constant. Using the given value \( f(0) = 0.1 \), we determine \( A = 0.1 \). Thus, the function becomes:

\[
f(x) = 0.1 \cdot 2^{x/2}
\]

To find \( f(10) \), substitute \( x = 10 \) into the function:

\[
f(10) = 0.1 \cdot 2^{10/2} = 0.1 \cdot 2^5 = 0.1 \cdot 32 = 3.2
\]

Thus, the value of \( f(10) \) is 3.2, which corresponds to option C.
