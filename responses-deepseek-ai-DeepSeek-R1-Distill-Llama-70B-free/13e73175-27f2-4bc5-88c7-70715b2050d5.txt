Okay, so I need to find the time it takes for a particle to return to its starting position after being projected up a slope. Alright, let's see. The problem gives me the initial velocity v0 and the angle alpha of the slope. Oh, and it's frictionless, so I don't have to worry about any energy loss due to friction.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with projectile motion up a slope, it's often easier to break the velocity into components parallel and perpendicular to the slope. Since the slope is at an angle alpha, the components would be along the incline and perpendicular to it.

Wait, the particle is projected up the slope. So the initial velocity v0 can be resolved into two components: one parallel to the slope (v0x) and one perpendicular (v0y). But wait, wait a second. No, because the slope is inclined, the direction of the velocity is along the slope, right? Oh wait, no—the particle is projected up the slope, so the initial velocity is along the incline. So the components would be in the direction of the slope and perpendicular to it.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The particle is moving up a slope inclined at alpha. So the direction of projection is along the slope. Therefore, the initial velocity has two components: one along the slope (v0_parallel = v0 cos(theta), but wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, when the projectile is moving along the slope, which is at an angle alpha with the horizontal. So the initial velocity is directed along the slope.

Oh wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the coordinate system. Let me set up a coordinate system where the x-axis is along the slope and the y-axis is perpendicular to the slope. So the initial velocity v0 is along the x-axis. Then, the acceleration components would be along the x and y directions.

Wait, but gravity acts downward. So in this coordinate system, the acceleration will have components along both x and y. Let me calculate that. The component of gravity along the slope (x-direction) is g sin(alpha), acting opposite to the direction of the initial velocity. The component perpendicular to the slope (y-direction) is g cos(alpha), acting downward.

Wait, so in the x-direction, the particle has an initial velocity v0, and a deceleration of g sin(alpha). So the motion up the slope will eventually stop when the velocity in the x-direction becomes zero. Then, the particle will start sliding back down.

But wait, the problem says the particle returns to its starting position. So the time taken to go up and come back down. But wait, if it's a frictionless slope, the particle would oscillate between the starting point and the highest point. Wait, no, because the particle is moving along the slope, not in a vertical plane. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing projectile motion with this.

Wait, no, in this scenario, the particle is moving along the incline. So, when it's projected up, it goes up the slope, slows down, stops, and then comes back down. So the time to return to the starting point is the total time for going up and coming back.

So the time up the slope would be the time it takes for the velocity in the x-direction to drop from v0 to zero. Then, the time coming back down would be the same, because the acceleration is constant. So the total time is twice the time it takes to reach the highest point.

Wait, correct. So I can compute the time to reach maximum height, multiply by two, and that's the total time.

So, for the x-direction, the initial velocity is v0, final velocity at the top is 0, acceleration is -g sin(alpha) (since it's acting opposite to the initial direction).

Using the kinematic equation: v = u + a t.

At the top, v=0, u=v0, a= -g sin(alpha).

So 0 = v0 - g sin(alpha) * t_up.

Solving for t_up: t_up = v0 / (g sin(alpha)).

Since the time up and down is symmetric (since the acceleration is constant), the total time is 2*t_up = 2 v0/(g sin(alpha)).

Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the entire motion as projectile motion, but in this case, the motion is constrained along the slope. Wait, but no, the particle is moving along the incline, not through the air as a projectile. So the earlier approach makes sense.

So the total time is (2 v0)/(g sin(alpha)).

Looking at the options:

Option A is (4 v0)/(g sin alpha) → too big.

Option E is 2 v0/(g sin alpha) → that's what I have.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because the initial velocity is along the slope, so when the particle goes up and comes back, the time is 2*v0/(g sin alpha).

But let me check: the time up is t_up = v0/(g sin alpha), and same for time down, so total 2 t_up. So correct, that would be option E.

Wait, but let me look at the options again.

Option E: 2*(v0)/(g sin alpha) → yes, that's 2v0/(g sin α).

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A: 4v0/(g sin α)

Option E: 2v0/(g sin α)

So the correct answer would be E.

Wait, but looking back, the question gives specific numbers: v0=2.4 m/s and alpha=26 degrees. But the options are all in terms of variables, so the problem is general, not specific to the numbers. So perhaps I can compute the time using the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the direction.

Wait, another approach: the particle is moving along the slope, so the motion is 1-dimensional along the incline. The net acceleration along the incline is a = -g sin(alpha) (opposing the initial direction). The displacement for the round trip is zero.

Wait, but wait, no. The displacement up and then back down is a round trip, but the net displacement is zero. So perhaps using the equation:

s = ut + (1/2) a t^2.

For the entire motion, the displacement s is zero. So:

0 = v0 * T + (1/2)*(-g sin alpha) * T^2.

Because the initial velocity is v0, and acceleration is negative.

So, 0 = v0 T - (1/2) g sin(alpha) T^2.

Factor out T:

T (v0 - (1/2) g sin(alpha) T) ) = 0.

Solutions are T=0 (the initial time) and T= (2 v0)/(g sin alpha).

Which again gives the same result: T= 2 v0/(g sin alpha), so option E.

Therefore, the correct answer should be E.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option E is written as 2(v0/(g sin alpha)), which is the same as 2v0/(g sin alpha).

Yes, that's correct. So the answer is E.

To determine the time required for a particle to return to its starting position after being projected up a frictionless slope inclined at an angle $\alpha$ with the horizontal, we analyze the motion along the slope. The initial velocity $v_0$ is directed along the slope, and the acceleration along the slope is $-g \sin(\alpha)$ (opposing the initial direction).

The particle moves up the slope, slows down, stops momentarily at the highest point, and then slides back down. The total time for the round trip is twice the time it takes to reach the highest point. Using the kinematic equation:

\[
v = u + a t,
\]

where $v = 0$ at the highest point, $u = v_0$, and $a = -g \sin(\alpha)$, we solve for $t_{\text{up}}$:

\[
0 = v_0 - g \sin(\alpha) \cdot t_{\text{up}} \implies t_{\text{up}} = \frac{v_0}{g \sin(\alpha)}.
\]

The total time for the round trip is:

\[
T = 2 \cdot t_{\text{up}} = \frac{2 v_0}{g \sin(\alpha)}.
\]

This matches the expression in **Option E**. Verifying with the kinematic equation for the entire motion:

\[
s = u t + \frac{1}{2} a t^2,
\]

where $s = 0$ (net displacement), $u = v_0$, and $a = -g \sin(\alpha)$, we get:

\[
0 = v_0 T - \frac{1}{2} g \sin(\alpha) T^2.
\]

Factoring out $T$:

\[
T \left(v_0 - \frac{1}{2} g \sin(\alpha) T\right) = 0.
\]

The non-trivial solution is:

\[
T = \frac{2 v_0}{g \sin(\alpha)}.
\]

Thus, the total time for the particle to return to its starting position is given by **Option E**:

\[
\boxed{2 \frac{v_0}{g \sin \alpha}}.
\]
