Okay, so I have this question about socialist or communist economic theory, specifically about something called Libermanism. I'm not too familiar with it, but I'll try to think through it. 

The question is asking what Libermanism is, and the options are A through J. Let me start by recalling what I know. I remember that in socialist systems, especially the Soviet Union, there were various economic reforms. Libermanism rings a bell as being related to one of those reforms.

Wait, wasn't there an economist named Evsei Liberman who proposed some changes to the Soviet economic system? I think he suggested using profit as a measure of efficiency for enterprises. That makes sense because in a centrally planned economy, sometimes there's a lack of incentives for efficiency since the state controls everything. So, maybe Libermanism introduced some market mechanisms or profit indicators to improve efficiency without fully moving to capitalism.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's without any centralization. That doesn't sound right because socialist systems usually have some central planning; Libermanism was a reform, not a complete shift to no centralization.

Option B talks about competitive markets in all sectors. I'm not sure. I think Libermanism allowed for some market elements, but maybe not all sectors. It was more about using profit as a criterion within the existing system.

Option C mentions state allocation based on social welfare. That sounds like a different approach, perhaps more aligned with socialism's focus on welfare, but I'm not sure if that's Libermanism.

Option D is laissez-faire capitalism. Definitely not, since Libermanism is within a socialist framework.

Option E is environmental sustainability. I don't recall that being the focus, so probably not.

Option F is universal basic income. That's a different concept, more related to social policies rather than enterprise efficiency.

Option G is about international trade and free markets. Doesn't seem relevant here.

Option H is eliminating state-owned enterprises, which doesn't fit because Libermanism was about making state enterprises more efficient, not getting rid of them.

Option I says it's evaluating efficiency using profit within a centralized economy. That aligns with what I remember about Libermanism. They introduced profit as a measure to judge how well state enterprises were doing, which was a way to boost efficiency without abandoning central planning.

Option J is a purely profit-driven system, which would be more capitalist, not part of a socialist theory.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be I: Libermanism is the evaluation of enterprise efficiency using the 'profit' criterion within a centralized command economy.

The correct answer is:

I: Libermanism is the evaluation of enterprise efficiency using the 'profit' criterion within a centralized command economy.
