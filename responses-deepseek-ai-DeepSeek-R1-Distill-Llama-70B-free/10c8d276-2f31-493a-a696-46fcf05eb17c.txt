Question:

A rancher, being owner in fee simpleconveyed the property by warranty deed to a woman. The woman gave her niece a mortgage on the ranch to secure a loan from the niece to the woman in the amount of $500,000. The mortgage was recorded immediately. Two years later, the woman conveyed the ranch to a farmer by quitclaim deed. The woman then defaulted on the mortgage, and the niece brought an in personam action against the farmer to recover the amount of the mortgage due. Assume that the woman's quitclaim deed to the farmer made no reference to the mortgage. The woman then defaulted on the mortgage, and the niece brought an in personam action against the farmer to recover the amount of the mortgage due. The mortgagee will probably

Options:

A: succeed, because the mortgage was recorded immediately.
B: not succeed, because the quitclaim deed did not reference the mortgage.
C: succeed, because an implied delegation of duties resulted from the woman's conveyance to the farmer.
D: succeed, because the quitclaim deed does not absolve the farmer of the mortgage debt.
E: not succeed, unless the farmer had constructive notice of the existence of the mortgage.
F: succeed, because the niece was a third-party beneficiary under the conveyance between the woman and the farmer.
G: not succeed, because the woman was still legally responsible for the mortgage debt.
H: not succeed, because the farmer did not promise to pay the mortgage debt.
I: succeed, because the farmer implicitly accepted responsibility for the mortgage by accepting the quitclaim deed.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here about mortgages and deeds. I'm a bit rusty on property law, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, let me read the problem again. A rancher conveyed property via warranty deed to a woman. Then the woman got a mortgage from her niece for $500k, and the mortgage was recorded immediately. Two years later, the woman conveyed the ranch to a farmer with a quitclaim deed, and the deed didn't mention the mortgage. She then defaulted on the mortgage, and the niece sued the farmer in personam to get the mortgage money.

So the question is whether the niece (the mortgagee) will succeed against the farmer.

Hmm. Let me think about the key concepts here. First, I remember that when a property is mortgaged, the mortgagee has a lien on the property. But when the mortgagor (the woman) sells the property, what happens depends on whether the new owner (farmer) takes the property subject to the mortgage or assumes the mortgage debt.

Wait, but the woman used a quitclaim deed. Quitclaim deeds convey whatever interest the grantor has, without any warranties. So if the woman had a mortgage, and she quitclaims the property, does that affect the mortgage?

I think that when a mortgagor sells the property, the buyer can either take it subject to the mortgage or assume it. If the buyer assumes the mortgage, they become personally liable for the debt. But if they take it subject to the mortgage, the debt remains with the original mortgagor, and the buyer's liability is limited to the property.

In this case, the deed didn't mention the mortgage. So the farmer didn't explicitly assume it. Now, the question is whether the farmer is still liable for the mortgage debt.

Wait, but the mortgage was recorded. So when the farmer took the deed, they had constructive notice of the mortgage because it was recorded. But does that mean they're liable?

I recall the concept of "in personam" liability versus "in rem." The niece is suing the farmer in personam, meaning she's trying to hold the farmer personally liable for the debt. For that to happen, the farmer needs to have assumed the mortgage debt.

But if the farmer didn't assume the debt—either explicitly or implicitly—then the farmer isn't personally liable. However, the property itself is still subject to the mortgage lien. So the niece could foreclose on the property, but can she go after the farmer personally?

Wait, the question is about an in personam action. So it's about personal liability, not just the property.

In most cases, when a buyer takes a property subject to a mortgage, they don't become personally liable unless they've agreed to assume the mortgage. Since the quitclaim deed didn't mention it, it's unlikely the farmer assumed it. So the farmer wouldn't be personally liable, only the woman would be. But the niece is suing the farmer.

So the mortgagee's options are either to go after the original mortgagor (the woman) or to foreclose on the property. But if the woman defaults, and the property is sold, the proceeds go to the mortgage. But if the farmer didn't assume the debt, they aren't personally liable.

Wait, but what about the recording of the mortgage? Does that affect the farmer's liability? Because if the mortgage was recorded, the farmer had constructive notice. But notice doesn't make them liable; it just means they can't claim they didn't know about the mortgage. So the property remains encumbered, but the farmer's personal liability depends on whether they assumed the debt.

So in this case, the farmer didn't assume the mortgage. Therefore, the farmer isn't personally liable. The niece can still foreclose on the property, but she can't hold the farmer personally responsible unless there's an assumption.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Succeed because mortgage recorded. Well, recording affects priority and notice, but doesn't make the grantee liable. So A might not be correct.

Option B: Not succeed because deed didn't reference mortgage. Hmm, but the deed's reference isn't required if the mortgage is recorded. The farmer is charged with knowledge. But again, that affects the property's status, not personal liability.

Option C: Succeed because implied delegation. Implied delegation would require some basis, like if the farmer assumed the mortgage. But the deed didn't mention it, so it's not clear.

Option D: Succeed because quitclaim doesn't absolve farmer of debt. Not sure, because the farmer wasn't a party to the mortgage. The debt is the woman's unless assumed.

Option E: Not succeed unless farmer had constructive notice. Wait, but the mortgage was recorded, so farmer had constructive notice. But does that make the farmer liable? No, constructive notice just means the farmer can't ignore the mortgage lien, but doesn't make them personally liable.

Option F: Succeed because third-party beneficiary. I don't think so. The mortgage was between woman and niece; the farmer isn't a beneficiary.

Option G: Not succeed because woman still liable. This makes sense because the woman is the mortgagor, and the farmer didn't assume the debt. So the niece can go after the woman, but not the farmer in personam.

Option H: Not succeed because farmer didn't promise. Yes, that aligns with what I was thinking. The farmer didn't assume the debt, so no personal liability.

Option I: Succeed because quitclaim implies acceptance. I don't think so. Quitclaim doesn't imply assumption of mortgages unless specified.

So I think the correct answer is either G or H.

Wait, so the question is about in personam liability. The woman is still responsible because she didn't transfer the personal liability to the farmer. The farmer only has the property, which is subject to the mortgage, but isn't personally liable.

So the niece can't recover from the farmer in personam. Therefore, the answer would be that the mortgagee (niece) does not succeed.

Looking at the options, option G says "not succeed, because the woman is still legally responsible." Option H says "not succeed because farmer didn't promise to pay."

Which is correct? Well, the in personam action is against the farmer. The farmer didn't assume the debt, so there's no personal liability. Therefore, the niece can't recover from the farmer. So the correct reason would be H: because the farmer didn't promise to pay.

Wait, but the mortgage is a debt from the woman. When the farmer buys the property, unless he assumes, he isn't liable. So H is correct.

But another angle: when a grantee takes property subject to a mortgage, they become personally liable if they agree to assume. Otherwise, they are not. If the mortgage is a lien on the property, the grantee's liability is limited to the property's value. So the niece can foreclose but can't get a personal judgment against the farmer.

So the answer should be H: not succeed because farmer didn't promise to pay the mortgage debt.

The question revolves around whether the niece, as the mortgagee, can hold the farmer personally liable for the mortgage debt after the woman defaulted. The key issue is whether the farmer assumed the mortgage debt when the woman conveyed the property via a quitclaim deed that did not reference the mortgage.

1. **Mortgage and Recording**: The mortgage was recorded, which means the farmer had constructive notice of its existence. However, constructive notice alone does not create personal liability for the debt unless the farmer assumed the mortgage.

2. **Quitclaim Deed**: A quitclaim deed transfers whatever interest the grantor (the woman) has in the property at the time of conveyance, without warranties. Since the deed did not reference the mortgage, there is no explicit assumption of the debt by the farmer.

3. **Personal Liability**: Personal liability for a mortgage debt arises only if the grantee (the farmer) explicitly or implicitly assumes the debt. In this case, there is no indication that the farmer assumed the mortgage. Therefore, the farmer is not personally liable for the debt.

4. **Options Analysis**:
   - **A**: Incorrect. Recording the mortgage ensures the lien is enforceable against the property but does not create personal liability for the farmer.
   - **B**: Incorrect. The absence of a reference to the mortgage in the deed does not determine personal liability; the key factor is whether the farmer assumed the debt.
   - **C**: Incorrect. There is no basis for implying a delegation of duties, as the deed did not reference the mortgage.
   - **D**: Incorrect. A quitclaim deed does not absolve the farmer of the mortgage debt only if the farmer assumed it, which did not occur here.
   - **E**: Incorrect. Constructive notice of the mortgage does not equate to personal liability for the debt.
   - **F**: Incorrect. The farmer is not a third-party beneficiary of the mortgage agreement.
   - **G**: Incorrect. While the woman remains legally responsible for the debt, this does not address the farmer’s personal liability.
   - **H**: Correct. The farmer did not promise to pay the mortgage debt, and without an assumption, there is no personal liability.
   - **I**: Incorrect. Accepting a quitclaim deed does not imply acceptance of the mortgage debt unless explicitly stated.

The correct answer is **H**: The mortgagee will not succeed because the farmer did not promise to pay the mortgage debt.
