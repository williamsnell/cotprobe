Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which option correctly lists Schelling's necessary conditions for the success of compellence. I remember that Schelling wrote about this in the context of international relations and game theory. Compellence is about using threats to make someone do something they wouldn't otherwise do. 

From what I recall, Schelling identified a few key conditions. First, the threat must be credible. The adversary has to believe that the coercer will actually carry out the threat if they don't comply. If the threat isn't credible, the adversary has no reason to give in.

Another point I remember is that the threat must be sufficient. That means the potential punishment for non-compliance should be so severe that it makes non-compliance not worth it. So the threat has to make non-compliance unbearable, not just a little bad. That rules out options where the threat is just sufficient to make non-compliance bearable, like option A. 

Then there's the time factor. The adversary needs enough time to comply. If the ultimatum is too short, they might not have the chance to respond, or it could lead to miscalculations. So options that say the adversary is given insufficient time, like option J, are probably wrong.

Also, Schelling talked about the need to assure the adversary that complying won't lead to more demands in the future. Otherwise, the adversary might think, why bother complying now if they'll just get more demands later? So the coercer needs to provide some assurance that this is a one-time thing. Options that don't include this, or say the opposite (like option D where compliance leads to future demands), are out. 

Another condition is that the conflict shouldn't be seen as a zero-sum game. That means both sides can find a way to benefit or at least not lose everything. If it's zero-sum, the adversary might resist more because they think any gain for the coercer is a loss for them. So all options that don't mention this are incorrect.

Looking at the options, let's go through them. 

Option A says the threat is sufficient to make non-compliance bearable. No, that's the opposite; it should make it unbearable. So A is wrong.

Option B talks about not unduly threatening and legitimacy of demands. I don't remember Schelling emphasizing legitimacy, so maybe B is incorrect.

Option C seems to fit. It says the threat is sufficient to make non-compliance unbearable, the threat is credible, time is enough, assurance against future demands, and conflict not zero-sum. That matches what I remember.

Option D has the assurance part wrong, saying compliance will lead to future demands. That would undermine the assurance, so D is out.

Option E lacks the sufficient threat part and perhaps others.

Option F says insufficient time, which is wrong.

Option G includes not using fear, which doesn't align with Schelling's points.

Option H mentions undue threat and legitimacy again, which I don't think are Schelling's points.

Option I says threat must not include military intervention, which I don't recall as a condition.

Option J has insufficient time, which is wrong.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be option C.

The correct answer is the option that aligns with Schelling's conditions for successful compellence. These include a credible threat, sufficient severity to make non-compliance unbearable, adequate time for compliance, assurance against future demands, and avoiding a zero-sum perception. 

- **Option C** satisfies all these conditions, making it the correct choice.

Answer: C
