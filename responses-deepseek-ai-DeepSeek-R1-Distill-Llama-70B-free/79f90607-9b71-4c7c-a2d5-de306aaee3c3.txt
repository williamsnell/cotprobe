Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question about Stern's theory in the nature-nurture controversy. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through what I remember.

The question is asking about Stern's 1956 theory. I remember that the nature-nurture debate is about whether behavior and traits are primarily influenced by genetics (nature) or environment and experiences (nurture). So Stern's theory must fit into one of these camps.

I think Stern was a psychologist. I recall something about him proposing that traits have a certain range of expression, which is determined by genetics. So like, a person's genetic makeup sets the boundaries within which their traits can develop based on the environment. This sounds familiar—it's like a range or a limit set by genes, and the environment determines where within that range the trait actually falls.

Wait, I think the term for this is the "rubber-band" hypothesis. Because it's like a rubber band that can stretch within certain limits but can't go beyond them. So the genetic part sets the limits, and the environment pulls it to a certain point within those limits.

Looking at the options, option I is the "Rubber-band" hypothesis. That must be the correct answer. Let me double-check the other options to make sure I'm not mixing things up.

Option A is "Genetic blueprint" which sounds more like a strict nature approach, maybe someone like Jensen. Option B is "Innate potential"—that could be related but I think it's more about innate abilities, not the range idea. Option E is "Blank slate," which is nurture all the way, like Locke or Skinner. So Stern's theory is a middle ground, combining both nature and nurture. So yes, I'm confident it's the rubber-band hypothesis, option I.

The theory proposed by Stern (1956) in the nature-nurture controversy is best described as the "Rubber-band" hypothesis. This theory suggests that genetic factors set a range of potential for trait development, while environmental influences determine where within that range the traits actually manifest. It represents a balanced view that combines both genetic and environmental contributions.
