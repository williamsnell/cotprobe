The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A man was driving his car when he suddenly hit a pedestrian as she was crossing the street. Following the accident, an ambulance was summoned and the pedestrian was taken to a nearby hospital. The man, who also drove to the hospital, approached the pedestrian in the emergency room while she was being treated for her injuries. When the pedestrian saw the man, she told him, "You went through that red light. You could have killed me. " She then asked the man for $5,000 to cover her anticipated medical expenses. The man replied that he would have to think about it. Shortly thereafter, the man sent a letter to the pedestrian in which he wrote, "I realize I drove through the red light. Naturally, I would like to settle this without any litigation. I'm willing to pay all your medical expenses and give you $2,000 if you don't sue me. " The pedestrian did not accept the man's offer and brought suit against him. At trial, the pedestrian's attorney offers the first sentence of the letter into evidence, and the man objects. The trial judge should rule the evidence

Options:

A: inadmissible as an admission made in connection with settlement negotiations.
B: inadmissible, because the man was not under oath when he wrote the letter.
C: inadmissible, as the pedestrian did not accept the man's offer.
D: inadmissible as it infringes on the man's privacy rights.
E: admissible as it is a written document.
F: admissible as it was not part of formal litigation.
G: inadmissible as an admission made in connection with an offer to pay medical expenses.
H: admissible as an admission.
I: inadmissible, because documents must be offered in their entirety.
J: admissible as it is a direct confession of the man's guilt.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence question. Let's see what the scenario is.

Alright, so a man hit a pedestrian with his car. After the accident, the man went to the hospital and offered the pedestrian $5,000 for her medical expenses. She didn't accept and sued him. Now, at trial, the pedestrian's attorney is trying to get a sentence from a letter the man wrote into evidence. The sentence is, "I realize I drove through the red light." The man objects, and we need to determine if the evidence is admissible.

Hmm, I remember something about settlement negotiations being inadmissible. Oh right, Federal Rule of Evidence 408. It says that evidence of conduct or statements made in compromise negotiations is inadmissible to prove liability. So if the man made that statement while trying to settle, it shouldn't be admissible.

Wait, the letter was part of a settlement offer. He said he'd pay medical expenses and give her $2,000 if she doesn't sue. So that's definitely a settlement negotiation. The first sentence where he admits to running the red light is part of that negotiation.

So the issue is whether that admission can be used against him. Normally, admissions are admissible under FRE 801(d)(2) because they're statements by a party-opponent. But wait, if the statement was made during settlement talks, FRE 408 would exclude it. Unless there's an exception.

I think FRE 408 excludes such statements unless they're for certain purposes like perjury or something else, but in this case, it's just offered to prove liability. So the statement shouldn't come in.

Looking at the options, option A says it's inadmissible as an admission made in connection with settlement negotiations. That sounds right. Option H says it's admissible as an admission, but that's probably incorrect because of Rule 408.

Other options don't seem to fit. Option B is about being under oath, which isn't relevant here. Option C is about the offer not being accepted, but the admissibility is about the nature of the statement, not acceptance. Option D is privacy rights, which I don't think applies. E is about being a written document, but that's not enough if it's excluded by another rule. F talks about formal litigation, but settlement offers can be part of litigation. G is about offering to pay medical expenses, but the admission itself is the issue. I is about entirety of documents, but the question is about a single sentence. J is about confession, but again, the rule excludes it.

So the correct answer should be A.

The correct answer is A. Under Federal Rule of Evidence 408, statements made during settlement negotiations are inadmissible to prove liability. The man's admission in the letter was part of an attempt to settle the case without litigation, so it is protected under this rule and cannot be admitted as evidence.

Answer: A
