Okay, so I've got this question about arbitrage-free securities market models. Hmm, I remember that in such models, the risk-free interest rate is a key parameter. The question gives me two stock price processes, S1(t) and S2(t), both expressed in terms of an exponential function involving time and a Brownian motion Z(t).

Wait, the formula for each stock is S(t) = S(0) * exp[rt + σZ(t)], right? Oh wait, no, maybe it's more like S(t) = S0 * exp[(mu - 0.5 σ²) t + sigma Z(t)], but I'm not sure. Or maybe in the risk-neutral framework, the drift is the risk-free rate.

Wait, the problem states that the risk-free interest rate is constant, and the model is arbitrage-free. So in an arbitrage-free model, under the risk-neutral measure, the drift of each stock should equal the risk-free rate, right? Because if it didn't, there would be arbitrage opportunities.

Looking at the given processes:

S1(t) = S1(0) exp(0.1 t + 0.2 Z(t))
S2(t) = S2(0) exp(0.125 t + 0.3 Z(t))

So the exponents have terms 0.1 t and 0.125 t. In the risk-neutral measure, the drift should be r, the risk-free rate. So does that mean that 0.1 and 0.125 are the risk-neutral drifts? But wait, if that's the case, how can both have different drifts? Because under the risk-neutral measure, all assets (assuming no dividends) should have a drift equal to the risk-free rate.

Wait, but wait. The problem says it's an arbitrage-free market model, which means that the model must satisfy the condition that the drifts of the stocks under the risk-neutral measure are equal to r. But the given processes are presumably under the real-world measure, unless stated otherwise.

Wait, no, the question doesn't specify whether these are under the physical measure or the risk-neutral measure. Hmm, but the question is about the risk-free rate. So perhaps in the risk-neutral measure, the drifts must be r.

Wait, but the model is given as arbitrage-free, so it's likely that these are the risk-neutral dynamics. Because in that case, the drift would be r for both stocks, but that's not what's given. Because S1 has 0.1 and S2 has 0.125.

Wait, that can't be, because in the risk-neutral measure, both should have drift r. So perhaps the given processes are under the physical measure, and we need to find the risk-neutral measure by adjusting the drifts so that they equal r.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let's think again. The general form for a stock in the physical measure is S(t) = S0 exp[(mu - 0.5 sigma²) t + sigma W(t)], where W(t) is Brownian motion. In the risk-neutral measure, the drift becomes r, so the process would be S(t) = S0 exp[(r -0.5 sigma²) t + sigma W(t)], assuming the same volatility.

But in the given problem, the drift terms are 0.1 and 0.125. So if the model is expressed under the risk-neutral measure, then these drifts should be equal to r. But wait, they can't be, because 0.1 and 0.125 are different. So that suggests that the given processes are under the physical measure, and the model being arbitrage-free requires that we can find a risk-neutral measure where the drifts are r.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The problem states that the model is arbitrage-free, implying that all assets have the same risk-neutral drift, which is the risk-free rate. So perhaps the given processes already satisfy drift r, making the coefficients of t equal to r.

Wait, but S1(t) has 0.1 t and S2 has 0.125 t. If the model is arbitrage-free, then under the risk-neutral measure, both drifts must be r. So maybe the given processes are under the physical measure, and we need to adjust them to the risk-neutral measure.

Wait, another approach: in the risk-neutral measure, the expected return of any stock is the risk-free rate. So the given S1 and S2 must have their expected growth rates under the risk-neutral measure equal to r. So perhaps the drifts given are under the physical measure, and we need to adjust them.

But the question is, what is the risk-free rate? It might be that the given processes are already under the risk-neutral measure, so the drifts would be r. But that can't be, because they have different drifts. So perhaps the given processes are under the physical measure, and the risk-neutral measure requires that the drifts are adjusted to r by changing the measure, i.e., changing the drift of the Brownian motion.

Wait, but in the risk-neutral measure, the drift of the Brownian motion is adjusted by the market price of risk. So for each stock, the physical drift is mu, and under risk-neutral it becomes r = mu - sigma * lambda, where lambda is the market price of risk.

But the problem states that the model is arbitrage-free, so it must be possible to find such a lambda that equates the drifts to r for both stocks.

Wait, but perhaps each stock's drift under the physical measure is given, and we can use that to find r. Because the market is arbitrage-free, there must exist a risk-neutral measure where both stocks have the same drift r.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think differently. For each stock, the expected growth rate under the physical measure is mu. Since the model is arbitrage-free, the risk-neutral measure exists, and under that measure, the drift is r.

But the given processes are expressed in terms of Brownian motion with drift coefficients 0.1 and 0.125. So perhaps these are the physical drifts. The risk-neutral measure will adjust these by some amount, so that the new drifts become r.

Alternatively, perhaps the given processes already represent the risk-neutral dynamics. But that can't be, because then both would have the same drift r, which isn't the case.

Wait, perhaps the question is simpler. Since it's an arbitrage-free model, the risk-neutral measure exists, and all non-dividend-paying assets must grow at the risk-free rate. So the given S1 and S2 must have their expected values under the risk-neutral measure equal to S0 e^{rt}.

So, if we take the expectation under the risk-neutral measure Q, E^Q[S1(t)] = S1(0) e^{rt}, and similarly for S2(t).

Looking at the given S1(t): S1(t) = S1(0) exp(0.1 t + 0.2 Z(t)). Assuming that under Q, Z(t) is a Brownian motion with drift, or perhaps the drift is adjusted.

Wait, no. Under the risk-neutral measure, the Brownian motion is adjusted by the market price of risk. So for S1, the process would be:

dS1/S1 = (r) dt + sigma dZ(t), where sigma is 0.2.

But wait, the given S1(t) is in the form exp(0.1 t + 0.2 Z(t)). So perhaps this is under the physical measure, where the drift is 0.1. So under the physical measure, the expected return is 0.1 for S1 and 0.125 for S2.

But in an arbitrage-free model, we can find a risk-neutral measure where the expected returns are r for both.

So under the risk-neutral measure, the drift would change. So the physical drift mu1 = 0.1, and the risk-neutral drift is r = mu1 - sigma1 * lambda, where lambda is the market price of risk.

Similarly, for S2: r = mu2 - sigma2 * lambda.

So we have two equations:

r = 0.1 - 0.2 * lambda

r = 0.125 - 0.3 * lambda

So setting them equal: 0.1 - 0.2 lambda = 0.125 - 0.3 lambda

Solving for lambda:

0.1 - 0.125 = -0.3 lambda + 0.2 lambda

-0.025 = -0.1 lambda

lambda = (-0.025)/(-0.1) = 0.25.

So lambda is 0.25. Now substitute back into one of the equations to find r.

Using the first equation: r = 0.1 - 0.2 * 0.25 = 0.1 - 0.05 = 0.05.

Wait, so r is 0.05? Let me check with the second equation: r = 0.125 - 0.3 * 0.25 = 0.125 - 0.075 = 0.05. Yep, same result.

So the risk-free rate is 0.05, which is option H.
</think>

In an arbitrage-free securities market model, the risk-neutral measure ensures that the expected return of all assets equals the risk-free interest rate, denoted as \( r \). The given stock price processes are:

\[
S_1(t) = S_1(0) e^{0.1t + 0.2Z(t)}
\]
\[
S_2(t) = S_2(0) e^{0.125t + 0.3Z(t)}
\]

where \( Z(t) \) is a standard Brownian motion. The coefficients of \( t \) in the exponents represent the drifts of the stocks under the physical measure. To satisfy the no-arbitrage condition, the risk-neutral measure must adjust these drifts such that both stocks have the same risk-neutral drift, equal to the risk-free rate \( r \).

The relationship between the physical drift (\( \mu \)), the risk-neutral drift (\( r \)), and the market price of risk (\( \lambda \)) is given by:

\[
r = \mu - \sigma \lambda
\]

For \( S_1 \), the physical drift is \( \mu_1 = 0.1 \) and the volatility is \( \sigma_1 = 0.2 \). For \( S_2 \), the physical drift is \( \mu_2 = 0.125 \) and the volatility is \( \sigma_2 = 0.3 \). Using these, we can write two equations:

\[
r = 0.1 - 0.2 \lambda
\]
\[
r = 0.125 - 0.3 \lambda
\]

Setting these equal to each other:

\[
0.1 - 0.2 \lambda = 0.125 - 0.3 \lambda
\]

Solving for \( \lambda \):

\[
0.1 - 0.125 = -0.3 \lambda + 0.2 \lambda
\]
\[
-0.025 = -0.1 \lambda
\]
\[
\lambda = 0.25
\]

Substituting \( \lambda = 0.25 \) back into one of the equations to find \( r \):

\[
r = 0.1 - 0.2(0.25) = 0.1 - 0.05 = 0.05
\]

Verifying with the second equation:

\[
r = 0.125 - 0.3(0.25) = 0.125 - 0.075 = 0.05
\]

Both equations confirm that the risk-free interest rate is \( r = 0.05 \).

The correct answer is **H: 0.05**.
