Question:

A man was under custodial interrogation as a suspect in the murder of a child. The police initially gave him a written list of his Miranda rights. They told him to read the list out loud, which he did. They then asked him if he understood the right to remain silent and to have a lawyer present and he nodded affirmatively. He refused to sign the writing but did not ask for an attorney. During the next three hours they interrogated him and got few answers; he was largely silent but did respond at times with a "no" or "yes" or a nod of the head. Then one of the detectives asked him if he was ready to ask God for forgiveness for killing the child. His eyes welled with tears and he said "yes." This opened further questioning leading to his admission of guilt. He would not sign a written confession or a waiver of the right to remain silent. He was arrested for murder and moved to suppress the confession. Will the court suppress the confession as being involuntarily given?

Options:

A: No, the suspect's emotional response and admission of guilt indicates a voluntary confession.
B: Yes, the confession is considered involuntary because he did not sign a written waiver of his right to remain silent.
C: Yes, the suspect's refusal to sign the written confession and waiver of rights indicates the confession was involuntary.
D: No, the suspect's engagement in the questioning, although minimal, demonstrates an understanding and voluntary waiver of his rights.
E: No, the confession is not considered involuntary as the suspect voluntarily answered the questions without the presence of an attorney.
F: Yes, the confession must be suppressed because the suspect was largely silent during the interrogation, indicating a lack of willingness to participate.
G: Yes, the use of religious deception to get a suspect to admit to crime renders the confession involuntary.
H: No, the circumstances indicate that he understood that he could stop the questioning and get a lawyer but he did not do so.
I: Yes, the confession must be suppressed because he was questioned for over three hours, making anything he said essentially involuntary.
J: No, whenever a written list of Miranda warnings is given to a suspect and he doesn't ask for a lawyer, this is proof that the suspect fully understands his rights.

Okay, I need to figure out whether the court will suppress the man's confession as involuntary. Let's break down the scenario step by step.

First, the man is under custodial interrogation, which means Miranda rights apply. The police gave him a written list of his Miranda rights. He read them out loud, so that's a good sign that he was aware of them. Then, the officers asked if he understood his right to remain silent and have a lawyer present, and he nodded affirmatively. That shows he understood.

He refused to sign the waiver, but he didn't ask for an attorney either. So, he didn't invoke his rights. The interrogation lasted three hours, during which he was mostly silent but occasionally responded with yes, no, or nods. That minimal engagement might indicate he wasn't entirely comfortable but didn't outright stop the questioning.

Then, a detective asked if he was ready to ask God for forgiveness for killing the child. His emotional response—teary eyes—and saying "yes" led to further questioning and his admission. The key here is whether this method of questioning made the confession involuntary.

I remember that the voluntariness of a confession depends on whether it was the product of a free and rational choice. If the interrogation techniques used were so coercive that they overbore the suspect's will, the confession could be suppressed.

In this case, using a religious appeal might be seen as a psychological tactic. Courts have found that certain deceptive or manipulative tactics can render a confession involuntary. For example, in some cases, police telling a suspect that a relative died to get a reaction has been deemed coercive.

So, the detective's question about asking God for forgiveness could be a form of psychological manipulation. If the suspect was emotionally vulnerable, this might have induced a false confession or made his statement not truly voluntary.

Looking at the options:

Option G says yes because the use of religious deception made the confession involuntary. That seems to align with the reasoning that such tactics can render the confession involuntary.

Other options don't fit as well. For example, B and C focus on the lack of a signed waiver, but Miranda doesn't require a written waiver—oral is sufficient. So B and C are probably incorrect.

Options A and D suggest the confession was voluntary because he responded. But the issue is the method used, not just his responses. So they might not address the coercion aspect.

Option E mentions no attorney present, but he didn't request one, so that's not the issue. Option F talks about him being largely silent, but he did respond, so it's not about willingness to participate.

Option H says he understood his rights, which is true, but the coercion could still make the confession involuntary despite understanding.

Option I is about the three-hour interrogation, but the key issue is the method, not just the duration.

Option J is incorrect because a written waiver isn't required; he just needs to understand, which he did by nodding.

So the best option is G: Yes, because the use of religious deception (like implying he should seek forgiveness) made the confession involuntary.

The court is likely to suppress the confession as involuntary. The key issue is the use of psychological manipulation through religious themes, which can render a confession involuntary if it overbears the suspect's free will. Although the suspect understood his Miranda rights and did not request an attorney, the detective's question about seeking God's forgiveness could be seen as coercive, especially given the suspect's emotional response. This tactic likely undermined the voluntariness of the confession. 

Option G correctly identifies that the use of religious deception to elicit the confession makes it involuntary.
