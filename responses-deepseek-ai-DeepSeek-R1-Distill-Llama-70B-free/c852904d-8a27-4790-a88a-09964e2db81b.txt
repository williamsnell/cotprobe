Okay, so I need to find the Fourier transform of the function f(t) = e^(-2t) sin(6t - 18) u(t - 3). Hmm, I remember that Fourier transforms can sometimes be tricky, especially when dealing with time-shifted functions and exponentials multiplied by sine functions. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, let's break down the function. The function is multiplied by u(t - 3), which is the unit step function. That means the function f(t) is zero for t < 3. So the function actually starts at t = 3. Also, the sine term has a phase shift: sin(6t - 18). Wait, I can rewrite this sine function using a trigonometric identity. Oh right, sin(A - B) can be expressed as sin(A)cos(B) - cos(A)sin(B). But maybe that's not the best approach here. Alternatively, I can factor out the 6t: sin(6(t - 3)). Oh wait, because 6t - 18 is 6(t - 3), yeah. So sin(6t - 18) = sin(6(t - 3)). That might be helpful because the function is also multiplied by u(t-3), which shifts the signal to start at t=3.

So, substituting τ = t - 3, then when t >=3, τ >=0. So f(t) can be rewritten in terms of τ. Let's see: Let τ = t - 3, so t = τ +3. Then for t >=3, f(t) becomes e^(-2(τ +3)) sin(6(τ +3 -3)) u(τ). Simplifying that, e^(-2τ -6) sin(6τ). And u(τ) is 1 when τ >=0, so that's our new function in terms of τ.

So f(t) for τ >=0 is e^(-2τ -6) sin(6τ). Wait, no: the exponent was e^(-2t), which with t=τ+3 is e^(-2(τ+3)) = e^(-2τ -6). So altogether, f(τ) = e^(-2τ) * e^(-6) sin(6τ) for τ >=0.

Wait, but wait: the original function is e^(-2t) sin(6t-18) u(t-3). So when I make the substitution τ = t-3, then t = τ +3, and f(t) becomes e^(-2(τ+3)) sin(6(τ)) u(τ). So yes, that's correct.

So f(t) can be written as e^(-6) e^(-2τ) sin(6τ) u(τ). So the function is a product of an exponential decay and a sine function, starting at τ=0.

Now, I remember that the Fourier transform of e^(-α t) sin(ω0 t) u(t) is given by the formula provided: ω0 / [ (α + jω)^2 + ω0^2 ]. But wait, in our case, the function is e^(-2τ) sin(6τ) multiplied by e^(-6). So the Fourier transform would involve that formula multiplied by e^(-6), perhaps?

Wait, but wait another thing. The time shift in Fourier transforms introduces a phase shift. Because the original function is shifted by 3 units, we have to account for that. The function in the time domain is f(t) = e^(-2t) sin(6t - 18) u(t-3). Alternatively, I can think of it as f(t) = e^(-2(t +3)) sin(6(t)) u(t) shifted by 3? No, maybe I should think in terms of the time shift property.

The time shift property says that if F(t) has Fourier transform F(ω), then F(t - t0) has Fourier transform e^{-j ω t0} F(ω). But wait, in our case, the function is f(t) = e^(-2t) sin(6t -18) u(t-3). Let me think about expressing this as a shifted function. Let me set τ = t -3, so when t >=3, τ >=0.

So f(t) = e^(-2(t)) sin(6(t) -18) u(t-3) = e^(-2(τ +3)) sin(6(τ +3) -18) u(τ).

Simplify inside the sine: 6(τ +3) is 6τ +18. So 6τ +18 -18 = 6τ. So sin(6τ). So f(t) = e^(-2(τ +3)) sin(6τ) u(τ) = e^(-6) e^(-2τ) sin(6τ) u(τ).

So in terms of τ, f(τ) = e^(-6) * [e^(-2τ) sin(6τ) u(τ)]. 

Wait, but when taking the Fourier transform, the function is in terms of t, so perhaps I should consider that f(t) is equal to e^(-6) multiplied by a function g(τ)=e^(-2τ) sin(6τ) u(τ), but τ is t-3. So in terms of Fourier transforms, the function is f(t) = g(t -3), but multiplied by u(t-3). Or wait, perhaps f(t) is a shifted version of g(t), but only existing for t >=3.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider that f(t) is g(t -3) u(t-3), where g(t) = e^(-2t) sin(6t) e^(6) or something? Wait, no, because when I expressed f(t) in terms of τ, I had e^(-6) times [e^(-2τ) sin(6τ) u(τ)]. So that's the same as e^(-6) g(τ), where g(τ) is e^(-2τ) sin(6τ) u(τ). So the function we're dealing with is, in terms of τ, e^(-6) g(τ).

So to find the Fourier transform of f(t), which is the same as the Fourier transform of g(τ) multiplied by e^(-6), but wait, no, because f(t) is a shifted version. Hmm, maybe I need to account for the time shift in the Fourier transform. So the time-shift property states that if you have a function h(t) = g(t - a), then its Fourier transform is e^{-jω a} G(ω), where G(ω) is the Fourier transform of g(t).

Wait, but in our case, the function is f(t) = e^(-6) g(t-3) u(t-3). Because when τ = t-3, and τ >=0, it's g(τ) = e^(-2τ) sin(6τ) u(τ). So in terms of t, g(t) = e^(-2t) sin(6t) u(t). So f(t) is e^(-6) g(t-3) u(t-3). So f(t) is a shifted and scaled version of g(t).

So using the time-shift property, the Fourier transform of f(t) would be e^(-6) multiplied by e^{-jω (3)} times the Fourier transform of g(t). Because f(t) = e^(-6) g(t -3) for t >=3.

Wait, no. Let me think again. g(t) is e^(-2t) sin(6t) u(t). So f(t) = e^(-6) g(t -3) u(t-3). So the function f(t) is the same as e^(-6) times g(t -3). So the Fourier transform would be e^(-6) times e^{-j ω (3)} G(ω). Because when you shift a function by t0, its Fourier transform is multiplied by e^{-j ω t0}.

So that's the plan. Now, I need to compute G(ω), the Fourier transform of g(t) = e^(-2t) sin(6t) u(t). 

Looking at the formula given in the problem: F[e^{-α t} sin ω0 t u(t)] = [ω0 / ( (α + jω)^2 + ω0^2 )]. So in this case, α is 2 and ω0 is 6. So G(ω) would be 6 / [ (2 + jω)^2 + 6^2 ].

Wait, let me compute that denominator: (2 + jω)^2 + 36. Expanding (2 + jω)^2: 4 + 4jω + (jω)^2. (jω)^2 is -ω^2. So 4 +4jω - ω^2. Adding 36 gives 40 +4jω - ω^2. So denominator is ( -ω^2 +4jω +40 ), which can also be written as ( (jω +2)^2 + (6)^2 ), since (jω +2)^2 = j^2 ω^2 +4jω +4 = -ω^2 +4jω +4. Adding 36 gives -ω^2 +4jω +40, which is the same as before. So yes, the denominator is (jω +2)^2 +36.

So G(ω) = 6 / [ (jω +2)^2 +36 ].

Now, putting it all together. The Fourier transform F(ω) of f(t) is e^(-6) * e^{-j ω 3} * G(ω). Substituting G(ω):

F(ω) = e^(-6) * e^{-j 3ω} * [6 / ( (jω +2)^2 +36 ) ].

Wait, but looking at the answer options, they have terms like e^{-3jω} and factors involving e^(-6) or similar exponents. Let's match this.

Wait, e^(-6) is a constant factor, and e^{-j3ω} is another factor. So the expression becomes 6 e^(-6) e^{-j3ω} / [ (jω +2)^2 +36 ].

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is 6e^-6 [e^-3jω / {(jω + 2)^2 + 36}]. Which matches exactly what I have here.

Wait, let me double-check the steps. I had f(t) = e^(-6) g(t-3) u(t-3). So the Fourier transform is e^(-6) * e^{-j3ω} G(ω), correct. And G(ω) is 6 / [ (jω +2)^2 +36 ].

So putting it together, the Fourier transform is 6 e^(-6) e^{-j3ω} / [ (jω+2)^2 +36 ].

Looking at the options:

Option F: 6e^-6 [e^-3jω / {(jω + 2)^2 + 36}]. That's exactly what I have. So the correct answer should be F.

To determine the Fourier transform of the function \( f(t) = e^{-2t} \sin(6t - 18) u(t - 3) \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Rewrite the function**: The given function can be expressed as \( f(t) = e^{-2t} \sin(6(t - 3)) u(t - 3) \). Using the substitution \( \tau = t - 3 \), the function becomes \( f(\tau) = e^{-2(\tau + 3)} \sin(6\tau) u(\tau) \). Simplifying further, \( f(\tau) = e^{-6} e^{-2\tau} \sin(6\tau) u(\tau) \).

2. **Fourier transform of \( g(\tau) = e^{-2\tau} \sin(6\tau) u(\tau) \)**: Using the provided formula for the Fourier transform of \( e^{-\alpha \tau} \sin(\omega_0 \tau) u(\tau) \), which is \( \frac{\omega_0}{(\alpha + j\omega)^2 + \omega_0^2} \), we identify \( \alpha = 2 \) and \( \omega_0 = 6 \). Substituting these values, the Fourier transform of \( g(\tau) \) is:
   \[
   G(\omega) = \frac{6}{(2 + j\omega)^2 + 6^2}.
   \]
   Expanding the denominator, \( (2 + j\omega)^2 + 6^2 = -\omega^2 + 4j\omega + 40 \), which can also be written as \( (j\omega + 2)^2 + 36 \). Thus:
   \[
   G(\omega) = \frac{6}{(j\omega + 2)^2 + 36}.
   \]

3. **Account for the time shift**: The original function \( f(t) \) is shifted by \( t_0 = 3 \). The time-shift property of the Fourier transform states that if \( f(t) = g(t - t_0) u(t - t_0) \), then its Fourier transform is \( e^{-j\omega t_0} G(\omega) \). Therefore, the Fourier transform of \( f(t) \) is:
   \[
   F(\omega) = e^{-6} \cdot e^{-j\omega \cdot 3} \cdot G(\omega).
   \]

4. **Final expression**: Substituting \( G(\omega) \), we get:
   \[
   F(\omega) = e^{-6} \cdot e^{-j3\omega} \cdot \frac{6}{(j\omega + 2)^2 + 36}.
   \]
   Simplifying, this becomes:
   \[
   F(\omega) = \frac{6e^{-6} e^{-j3\omega}}{(j\omega + 2)^2 + 36}.
   \]

5. **Match with the options**: Comparing this result with the given options, we find that it matches **Option F**:
   \[
   F(\omega) = 6e^{-6} \cdot \frac{e^{-j3\omega}}{(j\omega + 2)^2 + 36}.
   \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**F**
