Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the relative maximum value of the function y = (ln x)/x. Hmm, I remember that to find maxima or minima, we take the derivative and set it equal to zero. Right, that's from calculus.

Wait, let me think about the steps. First, I need to find the derivative of y with respect to x. The function is a quotient of two functions, ln x in the numerator and x in the denominator. So I should use the quotient rule for differentiation. Oh wait, or maybe I can simplify it using the product rule by rewriting it as y = ln x * x^(-1). Yeah, that might be easier.

So, using the product rule: if I have u = ln x and v = x^(-1), then the derivative y' is u'v + uv'. 

Let's compute u' and v'. The derivative of ln x is 1/x, so u' = 1/x. For v, which is x^(-1), the derivative is -1 * x^(-2), which is -1/x².

Putting it all together: y' = (1/x)(x^(-1)) + (ln x)(-x^(-2)). Wait, wait, no, let me double-check. Oh wait, no, the product rule is u'v + uv'. So u' is 1/x, v is x^(-1), which is 1/x. So u'v is (1/x)(1/x) = 1/x². Then uv' is (ln x) * (-1/x²). So overall, y' = (1/x²) - (ln x)/(x²).

I can factor out 1/x² from both terms, so y' = (1/x²)(1 - ln x). That's right. 

Now, to find critical points, set y' equal to zero. So (1/x²)(1 - ln x) = 0. Since x² is always positive for x>0 (since ln x is defined for x>0), 1/x² can't be zero. So 1 - ln x must be zero. Solving that gives ln x = 1, so x = e^1 = e.

So the critical point is at x = e. Now, we need to check if this is a maximum or a minimum. For that, I can use the second derivative test or analyze the sign changes of the first derivative around x = e.

Let me think about the first derivative's sign. For x < e: let's pick x = e^0.5, which is sqrt(e), approximately 1.648. Then ln x is about 0.5. So 1 - ln x is 0.5, positive. So y' is positive when x < e, meaning the function is increasing.

For x > e: let's pick x = e^2, which is about 7.389. ln x is 2, so 1 - 2 = -1. So y' is negative, meaning the function is decreasing after x = e. 

So the function increases up to x = e and decreases after, which means x = e is a relative maximum.

Now, what's the value of y at x = e? Plugging in: y = (ln e)/e. Ln e is 1, so y = 1/e. 

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check. Option H is 1/e. So that's the maximum value.

Alternatively, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the derivative. Wait, another approach to differentiate y = (ln x)/x is using the quotient rule: (v' u - u' v)/v², where u = ln x and v = x. So u' is 1/x, v' is 1. So the derivative is ( (1/x)*x - (1/x)*ln x ) / x². Wait, wait: let me compute it correctly.

Wait, the numerator in the quotient rule is (v' u - u' v). So v' is 1, u is ln x: that's 1 * ln x. u' is 1/x, v is x: so minus (1/x * x) which is 1. So numerator is (ln x) - 1. So the derivative is (ln x -1)/x². Wait, wait, I think I messed up earlier. Because the quotient rule is (u’v - uv’)/v², so u’ is 1/x, v is x, so ( (1/x)*x ) is 1. So the numerator is (1 - ln x). Wait no, let me re-do it.

Wait, let me be precise. Quotient rule says d/dx (u/v) = (u’v - uv’)/v².

So u = ln x, so u’ = 1/x.

v = x, so v’ = 1.

So numerator is (1/x * x) - (ln x * 1) = (1) - ln x = 1 - ln x.

Denominator is x².

So y’ = (1 - ln x)/x². Wait, that's different from what I got earlier using the product rule. Oh wait, no, no. Wait, in the product rule approach, I had y’ = (1/x²)(1 - ln x), which is the same as (1 - ln x)/x². So that's correct.

So setting y’ to zero gives 1 - ln x = 0 → x=e, same as before.

So value is y at x=e is (ln e)/e = 1/e.

Looking back at the options, option H is 1/e. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but let me check if any other options are similar. Option J is 1/(2e), which is half of that. Option D is 2/e, which is larger. So H is correct.

To find the relative maximum value of the function \( y = \frac{\ln x}{x} \), we start by finding the first derivative \( y' \). Using the quotient rule or the product rule, we determine that:

\[
y' = \frac{1 - \ln x}{x^2}.
\]

To locate critical points, we set \( y' = 0 \). Since \( x^2 > 0 \) for \( x > 0 \), the equation simplifies to:

\[
1 - \ln x = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \ln x = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = e.
\]

Thus, the critical point is at \( x = e \). To confirm whether this is a maximum, we analyze the sign of \( y' \) around \( x = e \). For \( x < e \), \( \ln x < 1 \), so \( y' > 0 \), meaning the function is increasing. For \( x > e \), \( \ln x > 1 \), so \( y' < 0 \), meaning the function is decreasing. Therefore, \( x = e \) corresponds to a relative maximum.

The value of the function at \( x = e \) is:

\[
y = \frac{\ln e}{e} = \frac{1}{e}.
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is \( \frac{1}{e} \), which corresponds to option H.
