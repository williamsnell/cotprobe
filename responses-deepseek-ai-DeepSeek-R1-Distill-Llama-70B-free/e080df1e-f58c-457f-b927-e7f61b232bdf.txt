Okay, so I have this problem here about stock being sold at a gain, and I need to find the percentage that the selling price is of the original cost. Hmm, let's break it down.

Alright, so the stock was sold with a gain of 13.5 percent on its original cost. Wait, so that means the selling price is higher than the original cost by 13.5%. I remember that when something is sold at a gain, the selling price is calculated as the original cost plus the gain.

So let's think in terms of variables. Let's say the original cost is C. The gain is 13.5% of C. So the gain amount would be 0.135 * C. Therefore, the selling price (which is what we're looking for) would be C plus 0.135C. Oh right, because the gain is added to the original cost.

So adding those together, the selling price SP = C + 0.135C. That's the same as (1 + 0.135) * C. So 1 plus 0.135 is 1.135. Therefore, SP is 1.135 times the original cost.

Wait, the question is asking for the percent the selling price is of the original cost. So that means, SP is what percent of C. So if SP is 1.135C, then as a percentage of C, that's 113.5%.

Looking at the options, option G is 113.5%, so that should be the correct answer. Let me just double-check my reasoning to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Original cost is 100%, gain is 13.5%, so total is 113.5%. Yeah, that makes sense. So the selling price is 113.5% of the original cost.

The stock was sold at a gain of 13.5% on its original cost. To find the percent the selling price is of the original cost, we calculate:

- Let the original cost be \( C \).
- The gain is \( 0.135 \times C \).
- The selling price \( SP \) is \( C + 0.135C = 1.135C \).

Thus, the selling price is 113.5% of the original cost. Comparing this to the options provided, the correct answer is:

G: 113.5%.
