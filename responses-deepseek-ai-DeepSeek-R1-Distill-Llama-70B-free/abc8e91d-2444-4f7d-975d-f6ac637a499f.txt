Okay, so I've got this problem here about Howard Travers and his purchases in St. Louis. I'm supposed to find the average cost per gallon of whatever he bought, and then pick the correct option from A to J. Hmm, let's see.

Alright, the problem says he bought four different quantities, each at a different price per gallon. The data is given as:

- 10 gallons at 33.9 cents
- 14 gallons at 32.9 cents
- 12 gallons at 31.9 cents
- 8 gallons at 29.9 cents

Wait, wait, let me make sure I read that correctly. Oh yeah, each line is quantity @ price per gallon. So I need to calculate the total cost for each purchase, add them all up, and then divide by the total number of gallons to get the average cost per gallon.

First step: Calculate the total cost for each purchase.

Starting with the first one: 10 gallons at 33.9 cents. So 10 * 33.9 = ... Let me do that multiplication. 10 times 33.9 is 339 cents. Because 33.9 *10 is 339.0 cents.

Second purchase: 14 gallons at 32.9 cents. So 14 *32.9. Hmm, 14 times 30 is 420, and 14 times 2.9 is ... 40.6? Wait, wait, 2.9 *14. Let me compute that. 2 *14 is 28, 0.9 *14 is 12.6. So 28 +12.6 is 40.6. So total is 420 +40.6 = 460.6 cents. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 32.9 is 30 +2.9. So 14 *30 is 420 and 14*2.9 is 40.6, so yes, total is 460.6 cents.

Third purchase: 12 gallons at 31.9 cents. So 12 *31.9. Let me think. 10 *31.9 is 319, and 2 *31.9 is 63.8. So 319 +63.8 is 382.8 cents.

Fourth purchase: 8 gallons at 29.9 cents. So 8*29.9. Hmm, 8 *30 is 240, but minus 8*0.1 which is 0.8. So 240 -0.8 = 239.2 cents.

Now, add up all the total costs. So:

339 (first) +460.6 (second) = 799.6

Plus 382.8 (third) = 799.6 +382.8 = 1182.4

Plus 239.2 (fourth) = 1182.4 +239.2 = 1421.6 cents.

Wait, let me check the additions again.

First, 339 +460.6 = 799.6. Correct.

799.6 +382.8: Let's do 799 +382 = 1181, and 0.6 +0.8 =1.4, so total 1182.4. Right.

1182.4 +239.2: 1182 +239 is 1421, and 0.4 +0.2 is 0.6. So 1421.6 cents. Total cost is 1421.6 cents.

Now, total gallons purchased: 10 +14 +12 +8.

10+14 is 24, 12+8 is 20. 24+20 is 44 gallons total.

So average cost per gallon is total cost divided by total gallons.

So 1421.6 cents /44 gallons.

Let me compute that. Hmm, 1421.6 divided by 44.

Let me see, 44 times 32 is 1408. Because 44*30=1320, 44*2=88, so 1320+88=1408.

So 44 *32 =1408. Subtracting that from 1421.6 gives 13.6.

So 32 with a remainder of 13.6. Now, 13.6 divided by 44 is 0.309... So approximately 0.309.

So the average is 32.309... cents per gallon.

Wait, that's 32.309... which is 32.31 when rounded to the nearest hundredth. But the question says to the nearest tenth of a cent, which is the first decimal place. So 32.3 cents?

Wait no, wait, wait. Wait, 0.309 is approximately 0.31 when rounded to two decimal places, but the question asks for the nearest tenth of a cent, which is one decimal place. So 32.3 cents? Because 0.309 is approximately 0.31, but if we're rounding to one decimal place, we look at the second decimal. So 0.309 is 0.3 when rounded to tenths, because the next digit is 0, which is less than 5. Wait, no. Wait, tenths is the first decimal, so 0.3. But wait, 0.309 is 0.31 when rounded to two decimals. But for tenths, it's 0.3.

Wait, no, wait. Let's think: 32.309 cents. To the nearest tenth of a cent, which is the first decimal place. So, 32.3 is the tenths place. The next digit is 0, which is less than 5, so we don't round up. So the average is 32.3 cents.

But wait, let me double-check the division because maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 1421.6 /44 more accurately.

Let me do the division step by step.

44 into 1421.6.

44 *32 =1408, as before. So 32 *44 =1408.

Subtract 1408 from 1421.6: 1421.6 -1408 =13.6.

So now, 13.6 divided by 44. Let's compute:

13.6 /44 = ?

Well, 44 goes into 136 (since 13.6 is 136 tenths) how many times?

44 *3 =132, so 3 times with a remainder of 4. So 3. So 0.309 approximately.

So total is 32.309, which is approximately 32.31, but when rounding to the nearest tenth (one decimal place), it's 32.3 since the next digit is 0.

Wait, but wait again. 32.309 is 32.309... So the first decimal is 3, the second is 0, third is 9. When rounding to one decimal place, look at the second decimal. So 32.309... The second decimal is 0, which is less than 5, so we don't round up. So yes, 32.3.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in adding the costs earlier. Let me recheck each total.

First: 10 *33.9 = 339. Correct.

Second:14 *32.9 =? Let me compute 14 *32 =448 and 14 *0.9=12.6. So 448 +12.6=460.6. Correct.

Third:12 *31.9. 10*31.9=319, 2*31.9=63.8. 319+63.8=382.8. Correct.

Fourth:8 *29.9. 8*30=240, minus 8*0.1=0.8. 240-0.8=239.2. Correct.

Total cost: 339 +460.6 =799.6. Then +382.8=1182.4. Then +239.2=1421.6. Correct.

Total gallons:10+14=24; 12+8=20; total 44. Correct.

So 1421.6 /44 =32.309... So 32.3 when rounded to the nearest tenth.

Looking at the options:

Options are from A to J. Let's list them:

A:33.5

B:30.5

C:32.7

D:35.0

E:30.9

F:32.3

G:31.8

H:31.4

I:34.1

J:33.2

So the correct answer is F:32.3 cents.

To determine the average cost per gallon of Howard Travers' purchases, we calculate the total cost for each purchase, sum them up, and then divide by the total number of gallons purchased.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost for each purchase
1. **10 gallons @ 33.9 cents**:  
   \( 10 \times 33.9 = 339 \) cents.  
2. **14 gallons @ 32.9 cents**:  
   \( 14 \times 32.9 = 460.6 \) cents.  
3. **12 gallons @ 31.9 cents**:  
   \( 12 \times 31.9 = 382.8 \) cents.  
4. **8 gallons @ 29.9 cents**:  
   \( 8 \times 29.9 = 239.2 \) cents.  

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost and total gallons
- **Total cost**:  
  \( 339 + 460.6 + 382.8 + 239.2 = 1421.6 \) cents.  
- **Total gallons**:  
  \( 10 + 14 + 12 + 8 = 44 \) gallons.  

### Step 3: Calculate the average cost per gallon
The average cost per gallon is given by:  
\[
\text{Average cost per gallon} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Total gallons}} = \frac{1421.6}{44} \approx 32.309 \, \text{cents}.
\]

### Step 4: Round to the nearest tenth of a cent
The value \( 32.309 \) cents rounded to the nearest tenth of a cent is \( 32.3 \) cents.

### Step 5: Match the result to the options
The correct answer is **F: 32.3 cents**.

**Answer: F**
