Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the future value of an ordinary annuity. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem says it's an ordinary annuity of $800 per year for 4 years at a 5% rate of return. I remember that an ordinary annuity is one where the payments are made at the end of each period, right? So each year, $800 is paid, and we need to find out what that sum will be worth in four years with a 5% interest rate each year.

I think the formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity is something like FV = PMT Ã— [(1 + r)^n - 1]/r. Let me make sure I remember that correctly. PMT is the annual payment, r is the interest rate, and n is the number of periods. Yeah, that sounds right.

So plugging in the numbers, PMT is $800, r is 5% which is 0.05, and n is 4 years. Let me write that out:

FV = 800 * [(1 + 0.05)^4 - 1] / 0.05

Let me compute the parts step by step. First, (1 + 0.05) is 1.05. Now, raising that to the 4th power. I think 1.05^4 is... let's see. Maybe I should compute it step by step.

1.05^1 is 1.05.
1.05^2 is 1.05 * 1.05 = 1.1025.
1.05^3 is 1.1025 * 1.05. Let me calculate that. 1.1025 * 1.05: 1.1025 * 1 is 1.1025, 1.1025 * 0.05 is 0.055125. Adding them gives 1.157625. So 1.05^3 is 1.157625.
1.05^4 is 1.157625 * 1.05. Let me compute that. 1.157625 * 1 is 1.157625, 1.157625 * 0.05 is 0.05788125. Adding them gives 1.157625 + 0.05788125 = 1.21550625. So 1.05^4 is approximately 1.21550625.

Now, subtracting 1 from that gives 1.21550625 - 1 = 0.21550625.

Then, divide that by 0.05. So 0.21550625 / 0.05. Let me compute that. Well, dividing by 0.05 is the same as multiplying by 20. So 0.21550625 * 20 = 4.310125.

So the factor [(1.05^4 -1)/0.05] is approximately 4.3101.

Now, multiply that by the PMT of $800. So 800 * 4.3101. Let me calculate that. 800 * 4 is 3200, 800 * 0.3101 is 800 * 0.3 is 240, plus 800 * 0.0101 = 8.08. So 240 + 8.08 = 248.08. So total is 3200 + 248.08 = 3448.08.

Wait, but let me do it more accurately. 800 * 4.3101 = 800 * (4 + 0.3101) = 800*4 + 800*0.3101 = 3200 + (248.08). So yeah, 3448.08.

Looking at the options, option F is 3448.1, which matches my calculation. So the answer should be F.

Alternatively, maybe I should check if I used the correct formula. Since it's an ordinary annuity, the payments are at the end, so the formula I used applies. If it were an annuity due (payments at the beginning), the formula would have a (1+r) multiplier. So yes, I think I did it right.

To calculate the future value of an ordinary annuity, we use the formula:

\[
FV = PMT \times \frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r}
\]

Where:
- \(PMT = 800\) (annual payment),
- \(r = 0.05\) (interest rate),
- \(n = 4\) (number of years).

1. Compute \((1 + 0.05)^4\):  
   \[
   1.05^4 = 1.21550625
   \]

2. Subtract 1:  
   \[
   1.21550625 - 1 = 0.21550625
   \]

3. Divide by \(r\):  
   \[
   \frac{0.21550625}{0.05} = 4.310125
   \]

4. Multiply by \(PMT\):  
   \[
   FV = 800 \times 4.310125 = 3448.08
   \]

The calculated future value is approximately **3448.08**, which matches option **F**.
