Okay, so I've got this economics question in front of me, and I need to figure it out. The question is about distinguishing between a change in supply and a change in the quantity supplied. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has three parts, a, b, and c. For each, I need to determine what kind of economic event it is. The options are change in supply, change in quantity supplied, or none of the above.

Let me start by recalling some basic concepts. 

A change in supply refers to a shift in the entire supply curve. This happens when there's a change in factors that affect supply other than the price of the good itself. Factors like production costs, technology, number of suppliers, natural events (like weather), and expectations can cause a change in supply.

On the other hand, a change in quantity supplied is a movement along the supply curve. This happens when the price of the product changes, leading producers to adjust the amount they supply. So, if the price goes up, they produce more, and vice versa, but the supply curve itself doesn't shift.

Now let's tackle each part of the question one by one.

Part a: Cold weather in Florida destroys a great deal of the orange crop. Therefore, there are fewer oranges in the country's supermarkets.

Hmm, cold weather affecting the crop. That sounds like a natural event impacting production. Since the weather has destroyed the oranges, the supply of oranges would decrease. This is a factor other than price affecting supply, so it should be a change in supply. Wait, but the result is fewer oranges in supermarkets. So, the supply curve shifts left because the quantity supplied at every price level is lower. So yes, that's a change in supply. So part a is a change in supply.

Wait, but wait again. The question is phrased as "there are fewer oranges in the supermarkets." So, is that just a reduction in the quantity supplied because, say, the price was too low, or is it a shift in supply? I think it's a shift because the weather caused a reduction in the available supply regardless of the price. So part a is a change in supply.

Part b: The cost of limes increases. As a result, bar owners raise the price of gin and tonics.

Okay, limes are probably an ingredient in gin and tonics. So if lime prices go up, the cost of producing each gin and tonic increases. Now, increased costs would affect the supply of gin and tonics. Higher costs mean that suppliers would need to sell at a higher price to make the same profit, so the supply curve for gin and tonics shifts left (or up, depending on the axis). So this is a change in supply.

Wait, but the result is that bar owners raise the price. So, are they adjusting the quantity supplied? Or is the supply curve shifting because their costs have gone up.

Let me think. If the cost of a component (limes) increases, it's a change in supply because it's a change in production cost. So the supply curve shifts. So for part b, it's a change in supply.

Wait, but the way it's phrased: "As a result, bar owners raise the price." Does that mean they're adjusting the quantity supplied? Because the price is changing in response to higher costs. Wait, but higher costs would cause a shift in supply. So the initial change is in supply, but the result is that at each price, the quantity supplied is less. Alternatively, the bar owners may have to increase the price to maintain profitability, which is a movement along the supply curve. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, when the cost of production (limes) increases, the supply curve shifts left. At any given price level, the quantity supplied decreases. So, the event is a change in supply. However, the action of raising the price could be seen as a change in quantity supplied if the price was adjusted in response to market conditions. But I think the root cause is a change in supply. So part b is a change in supply.

Wait no, another angle. Let's say the price of gin and tonics wasn't changing, but bars are forced to raise their prices because their costs went up. That would imply that they're moving along the supply curve because they're changing the price in response to higher costs. Wait, no, that's not right. The supply curve already takes into account the production costs. So when production costs rise, the supply curve shifts. So the fact that bar owners raise the price is a result of the supply curve shifting, meaning that for the same quantity, the price is higher. So part b is a change in supply.

Alternatively, if the price increased because the bars responded to a higher price of limes, then perhaps it's a change in quantity supplied. But I think it's a change in supply. So I'm a bit torn on part b.

Let me move to part c and then come back.

Part c: The price of leather shoes goes up. This induces manufacturers of leather shoes to increase production.

So, when the price of leather shoes increases, manufacturers produce more. That sounds like a movement along the supply curve. Because the price has gone up, quantity supplied increases. So this is a change in the quantity supplied, not a change in supply.

So part c is a change in quantity supplied.

Wait, but some might confuse this with a change in supply, but no, because it's a change in the price leading to a change in the quantity. So yes, part c is change in quantity supplied.

Now back to part b.

If the cost of limes increases, the cost of producing each gin and tonic goes up. So the supply curve for gin and tonics shifts to the left. So it's a change in supply. But the effect is that, at the previous price, bars can't sell as many, so they raise the price. Or perhaps, the bars are now supplying fewer gin and tonics at the original price, so they raise the price to a level where they can supply the same or adjust quantity.

Wait, perhaps it's a change in supply. So part b is a change in supply.

Wait, but another perspective: if lime prices go up, that's a change in the input price, which affects the supply of gin and tonics. So yes, that's a change in supply. So part b is a change in supply, and the result is that the price of gin and tonics increases because the supply curve shifts left.

So, to recap:

a) Change in supply (cold weather destroys crops, shifting supply left).

b) Change in supply (lime costs up, shifting supply curve left, leading to higher prices).

c) Change in quantity supplied (price of shoes up, so manufacturers increase production along the same supply curve).

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. For part b, when lime prices go up, that affects the cost of producing gin and tonics, so the supply curve shifts. So when the supply curve shifts, at each price, the quantity supplied is lower. So if the price of gin and tonics was P, and the supply curve shifts left, then at P, the quantity supplied would decrease. But the bar owners decide to raise the price. So perhaps the price adjusts to a new equilibrium. So the initial change is a shift in supply (change in supply). The raising of the price is a result of the supply shift, moving along the demand curve, perhaps. So the event is a change in supply.

So, for each of the events:

a) Change in supply.

b) Change in supply.

c) Change in quantity supplied.

Wait, but the options don't have all three correct. Let me look at the options.

Looking at the options, let's see.

Option I says a) Change in supply, b) Change in quantity supplied, c) Change in quantity supplied.

Wait, but according to my analysis:

a) Change in supply.

b) Change in supply.

c) Change in quantity supplied.

Which combination is that? Let me check the options.

Looking at each option:

Option D: a) Change in supply, b) Change in quantity supplied, c) None of the above.

Wait, no. Because I thought c is change in quantity supplied.

Option I: a) Change in supply, b) Change in quantity supplied, c) Change in quantity supplied.

Wait, but I thought part b is change in supply, not quantity.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with part b.

Wait, part b: The cost of limes increases. As a result, bar owners raise the price of gin and tonics.

So, the cost of limes is a resource; when it goes up, the supply of gin and tonics decreases (shifts left). So the supply curve shifts. So the change is in supply. So part b is a change in supply. So the event is causing a shift in supply, which would lead to a higher price if demand remains the same.

But the way the question is phrased, the bar owners raise the price. So are they adjusting the price, which is a movement along the supply curve? Or is the entire supply curve shifting because the cost changed.

I think it's the latter. The change in production cost shifts the supply curve. So part b is a change in supply.

So, my initial analysis was:

a: change in supply.

b: change in supply.

c: change in quantity supplied.

Which option matches this?

Looking at the options:

Option F: a) Change in supply, b) Change in quantity supplied, c) Change in supply.

No, because in my analysis, c is change in quantity supplied. Option F has c as change in supply.

Option I: a) Change in supply, b) Change in quantity supplied, c) Change in quantity supplied.

Hmm, that doesn't match because I thought b was change in supply.

Option G: a) Change in supply, b) Change in supply, c) Change in quantity supplied.

Yes, that matches my analysis.

But wait, let me check option G:

G: a) Change in supply, b) Change in supply, c) Change in quantity supplied.

Yes, that's what I thought.

So the first two parts are changes in supply, and the third is change in quantity supplied.

Looking back at the options, option G is:

a) Change in supply,

b) Change in supply,

c) Change in quantity supplied.

So that's option G.

Wait, but let me make sure.

Another approach: for each event, determine whether it's a change in supply or quantity supplied.

a) Weather destroys orange crop → supply decreases → change in supply.

b) Lime cost ↑ → cost of production ↑ → supply of gin-tonic ↓ → change in supply.

c) Leather shoe price ↑ → producers make more → change in quantity supplied.

Yes, that's correct.

So the correct option should have a and b as change in supply, c as change in quantity.

Looking at the options, option G is the only one that matches this.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option G: a) Change in supply, b) Change in supply, c) Change in quantity supplied.

Yes.

So the correct answer is option G.

To determine whether each economic event represents a change in supply or a change in quantity supplied, we analyze the nature of each scenario:

### Part (a)
Cold weather in Florida destroys a significant portion of the orange crop, leading to fewer oranges in supermarkets. This is a change in supply because the weather event affects the availability of oranges, shifting the supply curve leftward. It is not a change in quantity supplied, as the reduction in oranges is due to a factor other than the price of oranges.

### Part (b)
The cost of limes increases, causing bar owners to raise the price of gin and tonics. This is a change in supply because the increase in lime prices affects the production cost of gin and tonics, shifting the supply curve leftward. While bar owners raising the price might seem like a change in quantity supplied, the root cause is the shift in the supply curve due to higher production costs.

### Part (c)
The price of leather shoes increases, inducing manufacturers to increase production. This is a change in quantity supplied because the higher price leads to an increase in production along the existing supply curve. It is not a change in supply, as no external factors (e.g., production costs or technology) are altering the supply curve itself.

### Matching with Options
- **Part (a):** Change in supply.
- **Part (b):** Change in supply.
- **Part (c):** Change in quantity supplied.

The correct option is **G**, which aligns with this analysis.

**Answer: G**
