Question:

To preserve the appearance and accessibility of its capitol building, a state enacted a law prohibiting "the display of any sign on any portion of the public sidewalk surrounding" the building. A group of five demonstrators who wanted to protest inadequate state funding for children's services applied for a permit to march single file on the sidewalk surrounding the capitol building. Each demonstrator planned to carry a two-foot-square sign that would read, "Our lawmakers do not care about our children." The group's permit application was denied pursuant to the state law, and the group has filed an action challenging the law's constitutionality. Should the court uphold the law's constitutionality?

Options:

A: Yes, because the prohibition against the display of signs is necessary to maintain the aesthetic appeal of the capitol building.
B: No, because the prohibition violates the demonstrators' right to peaceful protest.
C: Yes, because the prohibition against the display of signs is a reasonable restriction in a non-public forum.
D: No, because the prohibition against the display of signs is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest.
E: No, because the sidewalk at issue is a public forum, and the prohibition against the display of signs is not narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest.
F: Yes, because the sidewalk at issue is not a public forum, and the prohibition against the display of signs is reasonable.
G: No, because even though the sidewalk at issue is not a public forum, the prohibition against the display of signs is more restrictive than needed to serve a legitimate government interest. government interest.
H: No, because the prohibition against the display of signs is a violation of the demonstrators' freedom of speech.
I: Yes, because even though the sidewalk at issue is a public forum, the prohibition against the display of signs is necessary to serve a compelling public interest.
J: Yes, because the sidewalk around the capitol building is private property, and the prohibition against the display of signs is a reasonable restriction.

Okay, so I've got this question about constitutional law, specifically dealing with freedom of speech and public forums. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a state law that prohibits displaying any signs on the public sidewalk around the capitol building. A group of demonstrators wants to march single file on that sidewalk, each carrying a two-foot-square sign protesting inadequate funding for children's services. Their permit was denied, and they're challenging the law's constitutionality.

I remember that public sidewalks are generally considered traditional public forums. In such places, the government can't prohibit speech unless it's necessary for a compelling interest and the restriction is narrowly tailored. So the key here is whether the state's law is a valid restriction on speech in a public forum.

The law in question is a blanket ban on any sign displays on the sidewalk. That seems broad. The demonstrators are carrying signs as part of their protest, which is a form of peaceful assembly and free speech.

I think about relevant Supreme Court cases. In United States v. Grace, the Court held that a federal statute banning solicitation on the Supreme Court plaza was unconstitutional because it was too broad and didn't serve a substantial government interest. Similarly, in Hague v. CIO, the Court established that streets and sidewalks are dedicated to public use and are part of the public forum where speech can't be unduly restricted without a compelling reason.

So, the state's law here is a content-neutral restriction because it prohibits all signs, not just specific messages. Content-neutral restrictions in public forums are subject to intermediate scrutiny, meaning they must be narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest.

The state might argue that preserving the aesthetic appeal is a substantial interest. But is a complete ban on signs the least restrictive means to achieve that? Probably not. There are less restrictive ways, like size or placement restrictions, that could maintain aesthetics without completely banning all signs.

Looking at the answer options, I need to find which one correctly states that the law is unconstitutional because it's not narrowly tailored. Option E says the sidewalk is a public forum, and the prohibition isn't narrowly tailored to serve a substantial interest. Option D mentions a compelling interest, but since this is content-neutral, it's substantial, not compelling.

Wait, no, because for content-neutral restrictions, it's substantial government interest and narrow tailoring. So the correct standard is whether the law is narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest.

Option E says it's not narrowly tailored to serve a substantial interest, which aligns with what I was thinking. Option D refers to a compelling interest, which is the higher standard for content-based restrictions.

Therefore, the correct answer should be E.

The question concerns the constitutionality of a state law prohibiting the display of signs on public sidewalks surrounding the capitol building. Public sidewalks are traditionally considered public forums, where the government cannot restrict speech unless it serves a substantial interest and the restriction is narrowly tailored. The law in question is a blanket ban on all signs, which is a content-neutral restriction. Such restrictions must pass intermediate scrutiny, requiring the law to be narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest.

The state's interest in preserving aesthetic appeal is not sufficient to justify a complete ban on signs, as less restrictive alternatives (e.g., size or placement restrictions) could achieve this goal without fully suppressing speech. The correct analysis focuses on whether the law is narrowly tailored to serve a substantial interest, not whether it serves a compelling interest, as the restriction is content-neutral.

Among the options, Option E correctly identifies that the sidewalk is a public forum and that the prohibition is not narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest. Other options either misapply the standard (e.g., Option D refers to a compelling interest) or mischaracterize the forum status (e.g., Option F claims the sidewalk is not a public forum).

Answer: E
