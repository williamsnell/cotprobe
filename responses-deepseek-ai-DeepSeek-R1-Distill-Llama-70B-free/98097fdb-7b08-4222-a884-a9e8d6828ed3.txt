Question:

A woman leased a condo from the owner for a period of one year. After six months, the owner gave the woman a written option to purchase the condo for $100,000 before the expiration of the lease. With the owner's approval, the woman spent $10,000 to have the kitchen remodeled to her personal specifications. One month before the end of the lease, the owner notified the woman that he was revoking the option to purchase the condo. One week later, the woman delivered a written notice of acceptance of the option, but the owner refused to sell. If the woman initiates suit for breach of contract, which of the following is her strongest argument that an enforceable contract was formed between her and the owner?

Options:

A: After the woman paid to have the kitchen remodeled, an option contract resulted, because the owner knew the woman was relying on the offer to her detriment.
B: Because the woman had indicated her intention to stay by remodeling the kitchen, the owner cannot revoke the option to purchase.
C: Because the owner was a merchant, the written offer was irrevocable for a period not exceeding three months.
D: Because the owner's offer invited a return promise as acceptance, the woman manifested her intent to accept by remodeling the kitchen.
E: Because the woman had started using the condo as her own by remodeling it, this signified her acceptance of the purchase option.
F: Because the woman had lived in the condo for more than half the lease period, she has the right to purchase the property.
G: Because the woman had until the expiration of the lease to accept the offer, the owner's revocation would be ineffective.
H: Because the owner had given written option to purchase the condo, the owner cannot revoke it unilaterally.
I: Because the woman had spent a significant amount on remodeling the kitchen, she had vested interest in the property thus forming an enforceable contract.
J: Because the woman had received written approval from the owner for remodeling, this constituted as acceptance of the purchase option.

Okay, so I've got this question about contract law, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the scenario carefully.

So, a woman leased a condo for a year. After six months, the owner gave her a written option to buy the condo for $100k before the lease ended. Then, with the owner's approval, she spent $10k remodeling the kitchen to her specs. A month before the lease ended, the owner revoked the option. A week later, she sent a written acceptance, but the owner refused to sell. Now she's suing for breach of contract.

The question is asking which argument she has that an enforceable contract was formed. The options are A to J.

I remember that an option contract is a type of contract where the offeror (here, the owner) agrees to keep the offer open for a certain period. Normally, offers can be revoked, but option contracts are exceptions. Typically, option contracts require consideration to be binding, meaning the offeree (woman) has to give something of value in exchange for the promise to keep the offer open.

In this case, the woman didn't pay any separate consideration for the option; the offer was just given as part of the lease. But she did spend $10k remodeling the kitchen with the owner's approval. So maybe that spending counts as consideration for the option.

Looking at the options:

Option A says that after she paid for remodeling, an option contract resulted because the owner knew she relied on the offer to her detriment. That sounds like promissory estoppel. Promissory estoppel prevents the revocation of an offer if the offeree relied on it to their detriment. So maybe that applies here.

Option B says that because she intended to stay by remodeling, the owner can't revoke. I'm not sure about this one. Intention to stay doesn't necessarily make the option irrevocable unless there's consideration or a separate option contract.

Option C mentions merchants and a three-month irrevocability. I think that's about the UCC rule for merchants' offers, but the question doesn't say the owner is a merchant or in a mercantile transaction, so maybe C isn't the right choice.

Option D says the offer invited a return promise as acceptance, and remodeling showed her intent. I'm not sure. Offers can be accepted by performance, but in option contracts, the consideration is what makes the offer irrevocable. Here, the remodeling might be seen as part of the consideration.

Option E suggests remodeling signified acceptance. No, remodeling is more about reliance, not acceptance. She hasn't accepted yet; she tried to accept later.

Option F talks about living there for more than half the lease. I don't think that's relevant to option contracts.

Option G states that she had until the lease expired to accept, so revocation was ineffective. Normally, without consideration, the owner can revoke an offer even if it's an option. So if there's no consideration, G might not hold.

Option H says because it was a written option, the owner can't revoke unilaterally. But without consideration, a written option isn't automatically irrevocable. So H might not be correct unless the writing itself counts as consideration, which it usually doesn't.

Option I says her spending created a vested interest. I'm not sure about that. Vested interest might relate to options in a different way, but I think it's more about reliance.

Option J says her approval for remodeling was acceptance. No, approval is about allowing the remodeling, not accepting the offer to purchase.

So, back to the main points. The key issue is whether the option was revocable. Normally, without consideration, the offeror can revoke an option even if it's written. But here, the woman spent money based on the offer, which might count as reliance, allowing promissory estoppel.

In the UCC, under ยง2-205, a merchant's firm offer can't be revoked for a certain period, but that's not applicable here unless the owner is a merchant, which isn't stated.

So the woman's strongest argument is likely under promissory estoppel. The owner made an offer, she relied on it by spending $10k with his approval, so he can't revoke the offer. That would make option A correct.

Wait, but option A says the option resulted because of reliance. Alternatively, option G says she had until the lease ended to accept, so revocation was ineffective. But without consideration, the owner could revoke. So if the remodeling is considered part of the consideration, perhaps making it an option contract.

Wait, the initial option was given without any consideration, but when she spent money with his approval, maybe that acted as consideration for the option, making it irrevocable. So in that case, the option couldn't be revoked.

So is the remodeling expenditure consideration? Yes, because she gave up $10k in exchange for the option to purchase. So that would make the option irrevocable.

In that case, the owner's revocation was ineffective because the option was supported by consideration. Looking back at the options, which one aligns with that.

Option G says she had until the lease expired to accept, so revocation was ineffective. If the option is supported by consideration, then G would make sense because the owner can't revoke once there's consideration.

But wait, the question is about which argument she can make. So her strongest argument is that because she provided consideration (the $10k), the option couldn't be revoked, making the contract enforceable when she accepted.

Option A is about promissory estoppel, which would apply if there wasn't consideration. But if she has consideration, then the option is irrevocable, so her argument would be based on that.

Looking at the options, option G says she had until the lease ended to accept, implying that the revocation was ineffective. That would be the case if the option was irrevocable due to consideration.

But wait, option H says because it was a written option, the owner can't revoke. But written alone doesn't make it irrevocable without consideration. So H is incorrect.

So between A and G. If the option was supported by consideration, then G would be correct. If not, then A under promissory estoppel.

In the scenario, the woman spent $10k with the owner's approval. That could be seen as consideration because it's a detriment to her (she spent money) in exchange for the option. So the option was consideration-supported, making it irrevocable.

Therefore, her strongest argument is that because she had until the expiration of the lease to accept, the revocation was ineffective. So option G is correct.

Wait, but option G says because she had until the lease expired to accept, the revocation was ineffective. That would be true if the option was irrevocable, which it would be if supported by consideration. So G is the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Option A: Reliance (promissory estoppel) makes the option irrevocable. But promissory estoppel applies when there's no consideration. If there's consideration, then the option is already irrevocable, so she wouldn't need to rely on estoppel.

So if the $10k is consideration, then the option is a valid option contract, and the owner can't revoke it. So her argument is that she had until the lease ended to accept, so the revocation was ineffective (option G).

Yes, I think that's right. So the answer is G.

The question revolves around whether an enforceable contract was formed when the woman attempted to exercise her option to purchase the condo after the owner revoked it. The key issue is whether the option was revocable or irrevocable. Normally, offers can be revoked, but option contracts are exceptions. For an option to be irrevocable, it typically requires consideration.

In this case, the woman spent $10,000 remodeling the kitchen with the owner's approval after receiving the written option. This expenditure can be seen as consideration, as she incurred a detriment (spending money) in reliance on the offer. Once consideration is provided, the option becomes irrevocable, and the owner cannot revoke it.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: This relies on promissory estoppel, which applies when there is no consideration but the offeree relies on the offer to their detriment. However, since the remodeling constitutes consideration, promissory estoppel is unnecessary, making this option weaker.
  
- **Option G**: This states that because the woman had until the expiration of the lease to accept, the owner's revocation was ineffective. This aligns with the principle that once consideration is provided, the option becomes irrevocable. Therefore, this is the strongest argument.

Other options, such as **Option H**, are incorrect because a written option alone does not make it irrevocable without consideration. Similarly, **Option A** is less applicable because reliance is secondary to the existence of consideration.

Thus, the woman's strongest argument is that the option was supported by consideration (the $10,000 expenditure), making it irrevocable, and the owner's revocation was therefore ineffective.

**Answer: G**
