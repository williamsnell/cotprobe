Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about corporate law, specifically regarding the removal of directors. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is: In the absence of a provision to the contrary in the articles of incorporation, what happens when the directors of a corporation are elected for a specified term? The options are A through J.

First, I remember that the general rule for corporations is that directors can be removed by shareholders, but the specifics depend on the circumstances and the state laws or the company's bylaws.

In many jurisdictions, if the articles of incorporation don't specify any particular rules about removal, the default is that directors can be removed with or without cause. I think this is something to do with the Model Business Corporation Act (MBCA), which a lot of states follow. Under the MBCA, if the articles don't have any provisions, directors can be removed by the shareholders, and the cause isn't required. So the shareholders can vote to remove a director at a meeting, regardless of whether there's a reason.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one matches this understanding. Let's go through them:

Option A: Requires a two-thirds majority. I don't think the default is a supermajority; I believe it's usually a simple majority unless stated otherwise.

Option B: Talks about failing to attend meetings. I think that's more of a specific cause, not the general rule when there's no provision.

Option C: Says they can't be removed before the term expires. That would be the case if the articles had specific provisions, but the question says there's none, so C is probably wrong.

Option D: Only the board can remove directors. That doesn't sound right because typically, the shareholders have the power to remove directors. Unless the articles say otherwise, I don't think D is correct.

Option E: Can be removed with or without cause. This aligns with my initial thought about the MBCA and default rules.

Option F: Requires a court decree. That seems too extreme and not the default case.

Option G: Needs a unanimous vote. That's a high bar and not the usual default.

Option H: Removal only for cause and after a hearing. I think this is when the articles specify that cause is needed, but the question says there's no such provision.

Option I: Removal only for cause. Again, if the articles don't say anything, cause isn't required, so I think this is wrong.

Option J: Requires a replacement to be identified. I haven't heard of that being a default rule. It's possible in some cases, but not the general rule.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be E: can be removed at a meeting of shareholders, with or without cause.

In the absence of specific provisions in the articles of incorporation, the default rule under the Model Business Corporation Act (MBCA) and many state laws allows shareholders to remove directors with or without cause. This means the shareholders can vote to remove a director at a meeting, regardless of whether there is a specific reason. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. A two-thirds majority is not the default requirement unless specified.  
- **B**: Incorrect. Failure to attend meetings is a specific cause, not the general rule.  
- **C**: Incorrect. Directors can be removed before their term expires if the default rule applies.  
- **D**: Incorrect. Shareholders, not just the board, can remove directors.  
- **E**: Correct. Matches the default rule of removal with or without cause.  
- **F**: Incorrect. Court involvement is not the default for removal.  
- **G**: Incorrect. Unanimous vote is not required unless specified.  
- **H**: Incorrect. Removal for cause and after a hearing applies only if the articles specify it.  
- **I**: Incorrect. Cause is not required under the default rule.  
- **J**: Incorrect. Identifying a replacement is not a default requirement.  

Thus, the correct answer is **E**.

Answer: E
