Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the structure of an atom, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is: The mass of an atom comes mostly from its _ ; and its volume from its _. The options are A through J.

Hmm, I remember that atoms have three main parts: protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons and neutrons are in the nucleus, while electrons orbit around it. 

Wait, so the mass... I think the nucleus is really heavy compared to the electrons. Protons and neutrons each have a mass of about 1 atomic mass unit (amu), while electrons are much lighter, around 1/1836 amu. So most of the atom's mass must come from the protons and neutrons together. Oh right, nucleons is the term that includes both protons and neutrons. So the first blank should be nucleons.

And the volume part... Atoms are mostly empty space. The nucleus is super tiny compared to the size of the atom. The electrons are spread out in electron clouds or orbitals around the nucleus, so the volume of the atom is mainly due to the electrons. Because the nucleus is so tiny, the size comes from where the electrons are.

So putting it together, the mass comes mostly from nucleons, and the volume from electrons. Looking at the options, option E says "nucleons; electrons." That seems right.

Wait, let me double-check the options. Option E is nucleons for mass and electrons for volume. I think that's correct.

I don't think any other options fit. Like option B says protons and electrons, but protons alone don't account for all the massâ€”neutrons contribute too. So nucleons make more sense. And the volume definitely isn't from the nucleus, so electrons must be the right choice for the second part.

The mass of an atom comes mostly from nucleons (protons and neutrons), as they reside in the nucleus and contribute significantly more mass compared to electrons. The volume of an atom, however, is primarily due to the electrons, as the nucleus is extremely small, and the electrons occupy the majority of the atom's space.

The correct answer is E: nucleons; electrons.
