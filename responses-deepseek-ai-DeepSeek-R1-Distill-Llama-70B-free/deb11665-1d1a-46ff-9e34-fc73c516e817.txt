Okay, so I've got this question about capacitors connected in parallel. Hmm, I remember that capacitors can be connected in different configurations like series and parallel, and each has a different way of calculating the equivalent capacitance. Let's think about this step by step.

The question says there are four capacitors, each 40 µF, connected in parallel. I need to find the equivalent capacitance of the system. Oh right, when capacitors are in parallel, the formula for the equivalent capacitance is different from when they're in series.

Wait, for capacitors in parallel, the equivalent capacitance (C_eq) is the sum of all the individual capacitances. So if each is 40 µF and there are four of them, I just add them up. Let me write that out: 40 + 40 + 40 +40. That's 160 µF. Oh, but wait, no, wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. No, wait, no, wait, no, no, wait. No, wait, in parallel, yes, you add them because each provides an alternative path for the charge. So each capacitor contributes its full capacitance to the total.

So calculating that, four times forty is 160. Let me check the options. Option F is 160 µF. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but sometimes I get confused between series and parallel. Let me double-check. In series, the reciprocals add up, like 1/C_eq = 1/C1 +1/C2 + ... So for series, each capacitor reduces the overall capacitance. But in parallel, each capacitor adds up. So yeah, four 40s in parallel make 160. So the answer should be F.

When capacitors are connected in parallel, the equivalent capacitance is the sum of the individual capacitances. For four capacitors, each of 40 µF, the calculation is:

\[
C_{\text{eq}} = 40 \, \mu\text{F} + 40 \, \mu\text{F} + 40 \, \mu\text{F} + 40 \, \mu\text{F} = 160 \, \mu\text{F}.
\]

Thus, the equivalent capacitance of the system is **160 µF**.

Answer: F
