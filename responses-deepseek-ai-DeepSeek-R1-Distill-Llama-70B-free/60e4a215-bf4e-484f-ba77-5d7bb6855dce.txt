Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric charges and forces. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. Alright, the question is: there are two point charges, q1 is 50 microCoulombs and q2 is -25 microCoulombs. They're placed 1.0 meter apart. Then there's a third charge, q3, which is 20 microCoulombs placed exactly midway between q1 and q2. The question is asking what the force on q3 is. And the options are from A to J, each with different values.

Alright, I remember that electric force between two charges is given by Coulomb's Law. Coulomb's Law is F = k * |q1 * q2| / r². But wait, since there are three charges here, I think I need to consider the forces from each of the other two charges on q3 separately and then add them up vectorially.

So, q3 is in the middle. That means it's 0.5 meters away from each of q1 and q2. Let me draw a quick mental picture. q1 is positive, q2 is negative. So q3 is between them. Since like charges repel and opposites attract, the force on q3 from q1 would be repulsion, pushing it away from q1. Similarly, the force from q2 would be attraction because q2 is negative and q3 is positive. Wait, no, q3 is positive, right? So q2 is negative, so the force on q3 from q2 would be attractive, meaning towards q2.

Wait, but wait, direction matters here. Let's think about the direction. So if q1 is at position x=0 and q2 at x=1.0 m, then q3 is at x=0.5 m. So from q1's perspective, it's positive, so it will push q3 away. Since q3 is in between, that means the force from q1 on q3 will be to the right, pushing q3 towards q2. From q2's perspective, which is negative, it will attract q3. So the force from q2 on q3 will be towards q2, which is to the right as well. So both forces are in the same direction, adding up.

So first, compute the force from q1 on q3, then the force from q2 on q3, add them together.

Wait, but since we're dealing with vectors, but since both forces are in the same direction, the net force's magnitude is just the sum of the magnitudes.

Let me get the values right. k is Coulomb's constant, which is approximately 8.988×10^9 N·m²/C². But sometimes, when calculating, people use 9e9 for simplicity. Let's see if I need to be precise or if approximation is okay.

q1 is 50 μC, which is 50e-6 C. q3 is 20e-6 C. The distance between q1 and q3 is 0.5 m.

So the force from q1 on q3 is F1 = k * (q1 * q3) / r².

Plugging in the numbers: F1 = (8.988e9) * (50e-6 * 20e-6) / (0.5)^2.

Let me compute that step by step. First, 50e-6 * 20e-6 = 1e-9 * 50*20 = 1e-9 * 1000 = 1e-6 C².

Wait, no: 50e-6 is 5e-5, 20e-6 is 2e-5. So 5e-5 * 2e-5 = (5*2)e-10 = 1e-9 C²? Wait, 50e-6 is 0.00005 C, 20e-6 is 0.00002 C. Multiplying gives 0.00005 * 0.00002 = 0.000000001 C², which is 1e-9 C². So 1e-9 C².

Then, r squared is (0.5)^2 = 0.25 m².

So F1 = 8.988e9 * (1e-9) / 0.25 = (8.988e9 * 1e-9) ) / 0.25.

8.988e9 * 1e-9 is 8.988. Then divide by 0.25: 8.988 / 0.25 = 35.952 N. So F1 is approximately 35.952 N.

Wait, but wait: the charges are q1 and q3. But the force on q3 due to q1 is in the same direction as the force due to q2. Because q1 is positive, so it repels q3, pushing it to the right. q2 is negative, so it attracts q3, pulling it to the right as well. So yes, both forces add up.

Now, the force from q2 on q3. q2 is -25e-6 C. So F2 = k * |q2 * q3| / r², but since q2 is negative, the force is attractive, so the magnitude is same as if they were positive.

So F2 = 8.988e9 * (25e-6 * 20e-6) / (0.5)^2.

Wait, same as before? Let's compute.

25e-6 is 2.5e-5, 20e-6 is 2e-5. So 2.5e-5 * 2e-5 = 5e-10 C².

Wait, 25e-6 is 25 * 1e-6, 20e-6 is 20 *1e-6. So 25e-6 * 20e-6 = 500e-12 = 5e-10 C².

So F2 = 8.988e9 * 5e-10 / 0.25.

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 *5e-10 = (8.988 *5) * 1e-1 = 44.94 * 0.1 = 4.494.

Then divide by 0.25: 4.494 / 0.25 = 17.976 N.

So F2 is approximately 17.976 N.

Wait, but wait, the signs: F1 is pushing to the right (from q1's repulsion), F2 is pulling to the right (because q2 is negative, so it's attracting q3). So the total force is F1 + F2 = 35.952 + 17.976 = 53.928 N, approximately 53.93 N.

Looking at the options: Option I is 53.94 N. So that's the closest.

Wait the options are:

A:65.32

B:60.12

C:30.47

D:10.00

E:80.25

F:35.78

G:25.50

H:75.58

I:53.94

J:45.00

Yes, I is 53.94 N. So the answer should be I.

To determine the force on the third charge \( q_3 = 20 \, \mu C \) placed midway between \( q_1 = 50 \, \mu C \) and \( q_2 = -25 \, \mu C \), we use Coulomb's Law:

\[
F = k \cdot \frac{|q_1 \cdot q_2|}{r^2}
\]

### Step 1: Forces on \( q_3 \) due to \( q_1 \) and \( q_2 \)
1. **Force due to \( q_1 \):**
   - \( q_1 = 50 \, \mu C = 50 \times 10^{-6} \, C \)
   - \( q_3 = 20 \, \mu C = 20 \times 10^{-6} \, C \)
   - Distance \( r = 0.5 \, \text{m} \)
   - \( F_1 = k \cdot \frac{|q_1 \cdot q_3|}{r^2} \)
   - \( F_1 = (8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot \frac{(50 \times 10^{-6}) \cdot (20 \times 10^{-6})}{(0.5)^2} \)
   - \( F_1 = (8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot \frac{1 \times 10^{-9}}{0.25} = 35.952 \, \text{N} \)

2. **Force due to \( q_2 \):**
   - \( q_2 = -25 \, \mu C = -25 \times 10^{-6} \, C \)
   - \( q_3 = 20 \, \mu C = 20 \times 10^{-6} \, C \)
   - Distance \( r = 0.5 \, \text{m} \)
   - \( F_2 = k \cdot \frac{|q_2 \cdot q_3|}{r^2} \)
   - \( F_2 = (8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot \frac{(25 \times 10^{-6}) \cdot (20 \times 10^{-6})}{(0.5)^2} \)
   - \( F_2 = (8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot \frac{5 \times 10^{-10}}{0.25} = 17.976 \, \text{N} \)

### Step 2: Net Force on \( q_3 \)
Since both forces act in the same direction (to the right), the net force is the sum of their magnitudes:
\[
F_{\text{net}} = F_1 + F_2 = 35.952 + 17.976 = 53.928 \, \text{N}
\]

### Step 3: Match with Options
The closest option to \( 53.928 \, \text{N} \) is **53.94 N**, which corresponds to **Option I**.

**Answer: I**
