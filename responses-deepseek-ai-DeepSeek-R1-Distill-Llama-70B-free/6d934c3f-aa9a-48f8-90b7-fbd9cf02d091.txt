Question:

A 45-year-old woman has a 2-week history of increased anxiety, abdominal discomfort, irritability, and difficulty concentrating; she was robbed at knifepoint in a parking lot 3 weeks ago. She takes levothyroxine for hypothyroidism and uses an over-the-counter inhaler as needed for exercise-induced asthma. Her blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg, and pulse is 100/min. Examination shows dry skin and hair. She is cooperative but appears anxious, glancing around quickly when a loud noise is heard outside the office. Leukocyte count is 12,000/mm3 , and serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration is 5.0 μU/mL. An ECG shows sinus tachycardia. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:

A: Generalized anxiety disorder
B: Social anxiety disorder
C: Obsessive-compulsive disorder
D: Adjustment disorder
E: Post-traumatic stress disorder

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about. 

The question is about a 45-year-old woman who's been having some symptoms for the past two weeks. The symptoms include increased anxiety, abdominal discomfort, irritability, and difficulty concentrating. Oh, and she was robbed at knifepoint three weeks ago. That's a pretty traumatic event. She's on levothyroxine for hypothyroidism and uses an inhaler for exercise-induced asthma. 

Looking at her physical examination, her blood pressure is 140/80, which is a bit on the higher side but not dangerously so. Her pulse is 100, which is tachycardia. The exam shows dry skin and hair, which could be related to her hypothyroidism, but her TSH is 5.0 μU/mL. Wait, what's normal for TSH? I remember that the normal range is usually between 0.4 and 4.5 or so. So her TSH is a bit elevated, which might indicate that her hypothyroidism isn't well controlled. But she's on levothyroxine, so maybe she's not taking it properly or needs a dose adjustment.

Her leukocyte count is 12,000/mm³, which is slightly elevated. That could be due to stress or maybe an infection, but her other symptoms don't point to an infection. The ECG shows sinus tachycardia, which is consistent with anxiety or stress causing an increased heart rate.

Now, considering her history, she was robbed at knifepoint three weeks ago. That's a traumatic event. The symptoms she's experiencing started after that event. So I'm thinking this might be related to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or acute stress disorder.

Wait, what's the difference between acute stress disorder and PTSD? I think acute stress disorder has a shorter duration, typically up to a month, and if it persists beyond that, it's considered PTSD. Her symptoms started two weeks ago, so that's within the timeframe for acute stress disorder, which usually lasts from 3 days to a month after the trauma.

But wait, the options given include both E (PTSD) and J (Acute stress disorder). So I need to figure out which one fits better.

PTSD symptoms last more than a month, right? The question says her symptoms started two weeks ago, so if it's been three weeks since the robbery, her symptoms are two weeks old. So it's still within the acute stress disorder timeframe.

But let me think again. The criteria for acute stress disorder require that the symptoms occur within a month of the trauma and last for at least 3 days. So in this case, since it's been three weeks, and her symptoms started two weeks ago, that fits. However, the duration is important. If it's been three weeks since the trauma, the symptoms can't have been present for more than a month. So if she's had them for two weeks, it's still within the acute stress disorder window.

Alternatively, if the question had said her symptoms have been present for two months, then PTSD would be more likely. But here, it's only two weeks, so I think acute stress disorder is the better fit.

But wait, looking at the other symptoms. She's anxious, has abdominal discomfort, irritability, difficulty concentrating. She's cooperative but appears anxious and glances around when a noise happens. That sounds like hypervigilance, which is a symptom of both acute stress disorder and PTSD. 

What about other options? Let's go through the choices.

Option A: Generalized anxiety disorder. That's possible, but her symptoms are more recent and tied to a specific traumatic event. Generalized anxiety is more chronic and not linked to a trauma.

Option B: Social anxiety disorder. No, that's fear of social situations, which doesn't fit here.

Option C: Obsessive-compulsive disorder. She doesn't have the compulsions or obsessions mentioned.

Option D: Adjustment disorder. This is for emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable stressor, but it doesn't include the specific symptoms of dissociation or hypervigilance. Plus, adjustment disorders are typically in response to less severe stressors than a robbery.

Option E: PTSD. It's possible, but since it's only been two weeks, acute stress disorder is more accurate.

Option F: Hypothyroidism. Her TSH is 5.0, which is slightly high, indicating maybe under-treated hypothyroidism. But her symptoms like anxiety and tachycardia could be due to both hypothyroidism and stress. However, dry skin and hair are more consistent with hypothyroidism, but her other symptoms don't fully align. Also, her pulse is 100, which could be due to either. But I think her main issue is psychological given the recent trauma.

Option G: Panic disorder. She might have panic attacks, but the question doesn't mention discrete panic attacks, just anxiety and difficulty concentrating.

Option H: Agoraphobia. That's fear of places or situations where escape might be difficult, leading to avoidance. Not indicated here.

Option I: Specific phobia. No specific object or situation causing fear mentioned.

So the main contenders are E (PTSD) and J (Acute stress disorder). Given the time frame, it's J.

Wait, but some sources say that acute stress disorder is diagnosed when symptoms occur within one month of the trauma and last for at least 2 days and up to 4 weeks. So yes, her two weeks of symptoms fit into that window.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Acute stress disorder, which is option J.

The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a 2-week history of anxiety, abdominal discomfort, irritability, difficulty concentrating, and hypervigilance, which began after being robbed at knifepoint 3 weeks ago. She is on levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, with a TSH of 5.0 μU/mL (slightly elevated), and uses an inhaler for exercise-induced asthma. Physical examination reveals dry skin, hair, and tachycardia (pulse 100/min). Her leukocyte count is 12,000/mm³, and the ECG shows sinus tachycardia. She appears anxious and hypervigilant, glancing around at loud noises.

The key to this case is the temporal relationship between the traumatic event (robbery) and the onset of symptoms. Acute stress disorder (ASD) is characterized by symptoms such as anxiety, hypervigilance, and avoidance of trauma-related stimuli, occurring within one month of the trauma and lasting for at least 2 days and up to 4 weeks. The patient’s symptoms started 2 weeks ago and have persisted for 2 weeks, fitting the timeframe for ASD. While post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a consideration, it is diagnosed only if symptoms persist beyond one month. Therefore, ASD is the most appropriate diagnosis.

Other options are less likely: generalized anxiety disorder is chronic and not tied to a specific trauma; adjustment disorder is for responses to less severe stressors; panic disorder requires discrete panic attacks; and hypothyroidism, while possible, does not fully explain her psychological symptoms.

The most likely diagnosis is **acute stress disorder**.
