Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about the dissociation of phosgene (COCI₂) at a certain temperature, 395 K. The reaction given is CO(g) + Cl₂(g) ⇌ COCl₂(g). Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, the question is about the dissociation of phosgene. Oh, right, so the reverse reaction. Because the way the question is phrased, it's about the dissociation, so the reaction should probably be written as COCl₂ decomposing into CO and Cl₂.

So the reaction for dissociation is COCl₂(g) ⇌ CO(g) + Cl₂(g). That makes sense because the question is about the equilibrium constant for the dissociation. So K_p for this reaction.

The problem gives me the equilibrium partial pressures: P_COCl₂ is 0.334 atm, P_CO is 0.116 atm, and P_Cl₂ is 0.128 atm. Wait, no, wait. Let me check the problem again. It says the equilibrium partial pressures are P_COCl₂ = 0.334 atm, P_CO = 0.116 atm, and P_Cl₂ is 0.128 atm. Oh wait, no, I think I might have gotten that wrong. Let me read again: "the equilibrium partial pressures are P_COCl₂ = 0.128atm, P_CO = 0.116atm, and P(Cl₂)= 0.334atm." Wait, no, the user wrote: "the equilibrium partial pressures are PCI_2 = 0.128atm, P_CO = 0.116atm, and P(COCl)2= 0.334atm."

Wait, that can't be right. Because in the reaction, COCl₂ is one of the products. Wait, no. Wait, the reaction given is CO + Cl₂ ⇌ COCl₂. So in the forward direction, CO and Cl₂ form COCl₂. But the problem is about the dissociation, which is COCl₂ breaking down into CO and Cl₂. So the K for the dissociation is the reverse of the formation reaction. So the formation K would be K_forward = (P_COCl₂) / (P_CO * P_Cl₂). But the dissociation K would be K_dissociation = 1 / K_forward.

Wait, but the problem says to determine K_p for the dissociation. So I think I should write the dissociation reaction as COCl₂ ⇌ CO + Cl₂, and the equilibrium expression is K_p = (P_CO)(P_Cl₂) / (P_COCl₂).

So let me plug in the given pressures. Wait, but according to the question, the given pressures are at equilibrium. So P_CO is 0.116 atm, P_Cl₂ is 0.128 atm, and P_COCl₂ is 0.334 atm.

Wait, no, wait a minute. Wait, the problem says "the equilibrium partial pressures are PCI_2 = 0.128atm, P_CO = 0.116atm, and P(COCl)2= 0.334atm." So I think that's a typo in the way it's written. Because PCI_2 would be Cl₂, and (COCl)₂ might be COCl₂. So, assuming that, the pressures are P_CO = 0.116 atm, P_Cl₂ = 0.128 atm, and P_COCl₂ = 0.334 atm.

So for the dissociation reaction, the K_p would be (0.116)(0.128) / (0.334). Let me calculate that.

0.116 * 0.128 = let's see: 0.1 * 0.128 is 0.0128, 0.016 * 0.128 is 0.002048. So adding those together, 0.0128 + 0.002048 = 0.014848. Then that's divided by 0.334.

So 0.014848 / 0.334 ≈ let's do the division. Let's approximate. 0.334 times 0.044 is about 0.014696. Hmm, because 334 * 44 = 14,696. So 0.014696 is 0.334 * 0.044. The numerator is 0.014848, which is a bit higher, so 0.044 plus a little. Let's see, 0.014848 - 0.014696 = 0.000152. So 0.000152 / 0.334 = approximately 0.000455. So total K_p ≈ 0.044 + 0.000455 ≈ 0.04445 atm, which is about 0.0444 atm.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is K_p 0.0444 atm, and option E is 0.0144 atm. So that's for the K_p part.

Now, the second part is the degree of dissociation at 395 K under a pressure of 1 atm. Hmm, wait, the degree of dissociation (α) is the extent to which the compound dissociates, right? So if we start with pure COCl₂ under 1 atm, what's the extent it dissociates into CO and Cl₂.

Wait, the initial pressure is 1 atm, and assuming we're starting with pure COCl₂, the initial partial pressure of COCl₂ is 1 atm, and CO and Cl₂ are zero. As it dissociates, let's say 'x' is the degree of dissociation. So the change would be:

COCl₂ ⇌ CO + Cl₂

Initial: 1 atm, 0, 0

Change: -x, +x, +x

Equilibrium: 1 - x, x, x

But wait, the stoichiometry is 1 mole of COCl₂ producing 1 mole of CO and 1 mole of Cl₂. So at equilibrium, the partial pressures would be:

P_COCl₂ = (1 - x) * P_total, but wait, because the total pressure isn't necessarily 1 atm anymore. Because when COCl₂ dissociates, each mole produces two moles (CO and Cl₂), so the total pressure would be (1 - x) + x + x = 1 + x.

Wait, wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let's think again. Let me set up an ICE table for the dissociation.

Let the initial pressure of COCl₂ be 1 atm, and CO and Cl₂ are zero. As it dissociates, let 'x' be the amount in atm that COCl₂ dissociates. So:

Initial:
P_COCl₂ = 1 atm
P_CO = 0
P_Cl₂ = 0

Change:
P_COCl₂ decreases by x → 1 - x
P_CO increases by x → x
P_Cl₂ increases by x → x

At equilibrium, the total pressure is (1 - x) + x + x = 1 + x atm.

But the system is under constant pressure? No, the problem states "under a pressure of 1 atm". Wait, no, the initial setup is at 1 atm, but when the reaction occurs, the pressure changes. Wait, but the question is about the degree of dissociation under 1 atm. So maybe it's under constant volume, but I'm not sure. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is carried out at constant pressure, so that the total pressure remains at 1 atm, but that complicates things because adding more moles would require volume changes.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the dissociation at a constant volume where the initial pressure is 1 atm. Alternatively, maybe it's more straightforward to think in terms of the partial pressures.

Wait, perhaps the degree of dissociation is given by α = (2x)/(1 + x), but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, considering the equilibrium expression in terms of K_p, which we found earlier as approximately 0.0444 atm.

Wait, the reaction is COCl₂ ⇌ CO + Cl₂, and the K_p for this reaction is 0.0444 atm.

So, let's model the dissociation. Let me define the change as x, the amount of COCl₂ that dissociates, so:

At equilibrium,

[COCl₂] = 1 - x (since we started with 1 atm and lost x to dissociation)
[CO] = x
[Cl₂] = x

But wait, no, because for each x of COCl₂ that dissociates, you get x of CO and x of Cl₂. So the total pressure would be (1 - x) + x + x = 1 + x atm.

Wait, but the pressure inside the system would adjust according to the number of moles. So the partial pressures would be:

P_COCl₂ = (1 - x) * (total pressure) / (total moles)

Wait, no, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should approach this using the ideal gas law, considering that the volume and temperature are constant.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the partial pressures in terms of mole fractions and total pressure.

Wait, since the problem states it's under a pressure of 1 atm, perhaps the total pressure at equilibrium is 1 atm. So, let me think again.

At equilibrium, the total pressure P_total = (n_total) RT / V. Since V and T are constant, P_total is proportional to n_total.

Initially, we have 1 mole of COCl₂, so P_initial = 1 atm.

As it dissociates, each mole of COCl₂ produces 1 mole of CO and 1 mole of Cl₂, so the total moles become (1 - x) + x + x = 1 + x moles. Therefore, the total pressure at equilibrium is (1 + x) times the pressure per mole, but wait, perhaps it's better to express the partial pressures in terms of mole fractions.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Another approach: Let's let x be the degree of dissociation. So the mole fractions would be:

n_COCl₂ = 1 - x
n_CO = x
n_Cl₂ = x

Total moles = (1 - x) + x + x = 1 + x

So the partial pressures would be:

P_COCl₂ = (1 - x)/(1 + x) * P_total
P_CO = x/(1 + x) * P_total
P_Cl₂ = x/(1 + x) * P_total

But since the total pressure is 1 atm, then:

P_COCl₂ = (1 - x)/(1 + x)
P_CO = x/(1 + x)
P_Cl₂ = x/(1 + x)

Now, substitute these into the K_p expression:

K_p = (P_CO)(P_Cl₂) / P_COCl₂

Substituting:

K_p = [ (x/(1+x)) * (x/(1+x)) ] / [ (1 - x)/(1 + x) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (x²) / (1 + x)^2
Denominator: (1 - x)/(1 + x)

So K_p = [x²/(1 + x)^2] * [(1 + x)/(1 - x)] ) = [x² (1 + x)] / [ (1 + x)^2 (1 - x) ) ]

Wait, simplifying that:

The (1 + x) terms: numerator has (1 + x), denominator has (1 + x)^2. So overall, it's x² / [ (1 + x) (1 - x) ) ]

Which is x² / (1 - x^2 )

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in simplification. Let me redo it.

K_p = [ (x^2)/(1+x)^2 ) ] / [ (1 - x)/(1 + x) ) ]

Which is equal to (x^2/(1+x)^2) ) * ( (1 + x)/(1 - x) )

So that's x²/(1+x)^2) * (1 + x)/(1 - x) = x²/( (1+x)(1 - x) ) )

Which is x² / (1 - x² )

So, K_p = x² / (1 - x² )

Wait, but K_p is 0.0444 atm, so:

x² / (1 - x² ) = 0.0444

Let me solve for x.

Multiply both sides by (1 - x²):

x² = 0.0444 (1 - x² )

x² = 0.0444 - 0.0444 x²

Bring terms together:

x² + 0.0444 x² = 0.0444

x² (1 + 0.0444) = 0.0444

x² = 0.0444 / 1.0444 ≈ 0.0425

So x ≈ sqrt(0.0425) ≈ 0.2062

So the degree of dissociation α is approximately 0.206, which is about 20.6%.

Looking at the options, option A has K_p 0.0444 atm and degree of dissociation 0.206, which matches our calculations.

Wait, but wait—let me double-check the setup. Because I considered that the total pressure is 1 atm, but the initial pressure is 1 atm of COCl₂, and upon dissociation, the pressure increases. So perhaps the approach is correct.

Alternatively, let me think of it another way. Let's let the initial pressure of COCl₂ be 1 atm, and as it dissociates, x atm of COCl₂ decomposes into x atm of CO and x atm of Cl₂. So the total pressure becomes (1 - x) + x + x = 1 + x atm. But since the problem states that the pressure is 1 atm, that complicates things, because the pressure can't both be 1 atm and change. Therefore, perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Wait, maybe I should think of it in terms of a fixed volume. Let’s say that the reaction occurs in a rigid container, so the volume is fixed. Then, the initial pressure is 1 atm (only COCl₂). As it dissociates, the number of moles increases, so the pressure increases. But the problem states "under a pressure of 1 atm," which suggests that the total pressure is maintained at 1 atm, perhaps by changing the volume. That complicates things, but maybe in this case, we can model it as if the system is under a constant pressure of 1 atm, so the volume adjusts as needed. But that might require more advanced calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually considering the reaction at equilibrium with a total pressure of 1 atm, but that's not how the question is phrased. The question says, "the degree of dissociation at 395 K under a pressure of 1 atm." So perhaps the initial pressure is 1 atm, and we're to find the degree of dissociation under those conditions.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach I took was correct, considering that the total pressure is 1 atm. So I think the setup where K_p = x²/(1 - x²) is accurate, leading to x ≈ 0.206, which is option A.

So the answer should be option A: K_p 0.0444 atm, degree of dissociation 0.206.
</think>

To determine the equilibrium constant \( K_p \) for the dissociation of phosgene and the degree of dissociation at 395 K under a pressure of 1 atm, we analyze the reaction:

\[
\text{COCl}_2(g) \rightleftharpoons \text{CO}(g) + \text{Cl}_2(g)
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( K_p \) for the dissociation
The equilibrium partial pressures are given as:
- \( P_{\text{COCl}_2} = 0.334 \, \text{atm} \)
- \( P_{\text{CO}} = 0.116 \, \text{atm} \)
- \( P_{\text{Cl}_2} = 0.128 \, \text{atm} \)

The equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction is expressed as:

\[
K_p = \frac{P_{\text{CO}} \cdot P_{\text{Cl}_2}}{P_{\text{COCl}_2}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
K_p = \frac{(0.116)(0.128)}{0.334}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
0.116 \cdot 0.128 = 0.014848
\]

Then divide by the denominator:

\[
K_p = \frac{0.014848}{0.334} \approx 0.0444 \, \text{atm}
\]

Thus, \( K_p = 0.0444 \, \text{atm} \).

---

### Step 2: Determine the degree of dissociation (\( \alpha \)) at 1 atm
Assume the initial pressure of pure phosgene is 1 atm. Let \( \alpha \) represent the degree of dissociation. At equilibrium:
- \( P_{\text{COCl}_2} = 1 - \alpha \)
- \( P_{\text{CO}} = \alpha \)
- \( P_{\text{Cl}_2} = \alpha \)

The equilibrium constant expression becomes:

\[
K_p = \frac{P_{\text{CO}} \cdot P_{\text{Cl}_2}}{P_{\text{COCl}_2}} = \frac{\alpha \cdot \alpha}{1 - \alpha}
\]

Substitute \( K_p = 0.0444 \):

\[
0.0444 = \frac{\alpha^2}{1 - \alpha}
\]

Rearrange and solve for \( \alpha \):

\[
\alpha^2 = 0.0444 \cdot (1 - \alpha)
\]

\[
\alpha^2 + 0.0444 \cdot \alpha - 0.0444 = 0
\]

This is a quadratic equation of the form \( \alpha^2 + b\alpha + c = 0 \), where:
- \( a = 1 \)
- \( b = 0.0444 \)
- \( c = -0.0444 \)

Using the quadratic formula:

\[
\alpha = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\alpha = \frac{-0.0444 \pm \sqrt{(0.0444)^2 - 4(1)(-0.0444)}}{2(1)}
\]
