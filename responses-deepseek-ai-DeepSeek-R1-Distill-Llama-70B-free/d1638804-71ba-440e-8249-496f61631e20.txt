Okay, so I've got this statistics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about hypothesis testing, specifically choosing the correct option that gives the greatest power when certain conditions are met.

Alright, the setup is this: We're testing a hypothesis where the null hypothesis H0 is that the population mean μ is 70, and the alternative hypothesis Ha is that μ is less than 70. So this is a one-tailed test, specifically a left-tailed test because we're testing if the mean is less than 70.

The question is asking which combination of significance level (alpha) and sample size (n) will result in the highest power of the test when the true mean μ is 65. Power, as I remember, is the probability that the test correctly rejects the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true. So higher power means a lower probability of Type II errors.

First, I need to recall that the power of a test depends on several factors: the significance level alpha, the sample size n, the effect size, and the variability in the data. But in this question, I don't think variability is given, so I assume it's held constant across all options, or maybe each option has the same standard deviation. Since it's not provided, I'll focus on the variables given: alpha and n.

I remember that for a given significance level, a larger sample size increases the power of the test. Because with more data, the sampling distribution becomes more precise, making it easier to detect a true effect. So, all else being equal, higher n should mean higher power.

But also, the significance level alpha plays a role. A higher alpha means that the critical value is further from the null mean, making it easier to reject H0. Wait, no, actually, wait. Let me think. For a left-tailed test, the critical value is on the left side of the distribution. So if alpha increases, the critical value moves further away from the mean under H0, but actually, no. Wait, alpha is the area in the tail. So for a left-tailed test, a higher alpha means the critical value is further to the left, which makes the rejection region larger. That makes it easier to reject H0 when Ha is true because the sample mean doesn't have to be as extreme.

Wait, no. Correcting myself: The critical value is determined by the alpha level. For a left-tailed test, a larger alpha (like 0.1 instead of 0.05) would result in a critical value that's less extreme because the area to the left is larger. Wait no, that's not right. Let me think again. For a left-tailed test at alpha=0.05, the critical value is the value such that 5% of the distribution lies to its left. If alpha is 0.10, then the critical value is less to the left because 10% of the distribution is to its left. So the critical value is actually greater (closer to the mean) when alpha increases. So for a left-tailed test, a higher alpha makes the critical value higher (closer to the mean under H0), which makes the rejection region include a larger area. So for a given sample size, a higher alpha increases the power because it's easier to reject H0 when the true mean is less than 70.

Wait, yes, that's correct. Because when you have a higher alpha, the critical value moves towards the mean, making it easier to reject H0. So, higher alpha increases power, other factors being equal.

So, to maximize power, you want the highest possible alpha and the largest possible sample size. Because both contribute to a higher probability of rejecting H0 when it's false.

Looking at the options, let's list them out:

A: α=0.05, n=15
B: α=0.01, n=30
C: α=0.05, n=45
D: α=0.01, n=45
E: α=0.05, n=30
F: α=0.1, n=30
G: α=0.01, n=15
H: α=0.02, n=25
I: α=0.1, n=45
J: α=0.1, n=15

We need to find which option has the highest alpha and the highest n. Because higher alpha and higher n both contribute to higher power.

Looking at the options:

Option I: α=0.1, n=45. That's the highest alpha (0.1) and the highest n (45). So that would be the best.

Option F: α=0.1, n=30. Same alpha as I, but lower n.

Option J: α=0.1, n=15. Same alpha as I, but even lower n.

So among these, I is better than F and J because n is higher. So I is the best so far.

Wait, but let's check other options. For example, option C: α=0.05, n=45. So higher n than F, but lower alpha than I. So which contributes more to power—higher alpha or larger n?

Hmm, I think the effect of both factors isn't just additive. So the power function depends on both. But generally, for a given effect size, a larger sample size can have a bigger impact on power than a higher alpha. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, effect size is (μ_Ha - μ_H0)/sigma. Here, μ_Ha is 65, so the effect size is (65-70)/sigma = (-5)/sigma. So it's a moderate effect size, but the exact impact would depend on the sample size and alpha.

In general, increasing sample size increases power more than increasing alpha, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think differently.

At a higher alpha, say 0.1 compared to 0.01, the critical value is higher (closer to the mean). So for a given sample size, a higher alpha makes it easier to reject H0, thus increasing power.

But a larger sample size also increases power because the standard error is smaller, so the sampling distribution is tighter around the true mean.

So, which has a bigger effect, increasing alpha from 0.01 to 0.1, or increasing n from 30 to 45?

I think that the increase in n from 30 to 45 would have a more substantial effect on power than increasing alpha, but maybe not. Alternatively, it could depend on the specific values.

Wait, but in option I, both alpha is higher (0.1) and n is the highest (45). So that's the best possible combination.

So I think option I is the correct answer.

Wait, but let me check all options again. Let's see which options have higher alpha and higher n.

Option I: 0.1, 45.

Option F: 0.1, 30.

Option C: 0.05,45.

So I is better than C because higher alpha, same n.

So among all, I has the highest alpha and highest n. So I think that's the best.

Wait, but let me think about another approach. The power is calculated using the non-central t-distribution, or in the case of large samples, the normal distribution.

The formula for power is P(reject H0 | μ=65). This depends on how far the sample mean falls into the rejection region.

The rejection region for a left-tailed test at significance level α is: sample mean < μ0 - z_(α) * (σ/√n), assuming we're using a z-test. Or if it's a t-test, but for large n, t and z are similar.

Wait, but without knowing the standard deviation, we can't compute exact values. But all options have the same μ0=70, same Ha: μ=65. So the effect size is fixed, but the standard error (σ/√n) varies with n.

So the critical value for each option would be μ0 - z_(alpha) * (σ/√n). So for higher n, the standard error decreases, making the critical value closer to μ0.

Wait, but μ0 is 70, and the true mean is 65. So for the power, the sample mean needs to be less than the critical value.

So, the distance between the true mean (65) and the critical value determines the power. The farther the critical value is from 65, the higher the power (because more of the sampling distribution around 65 would lie below the critical value).

Wait, no. The critical value is on the left side. So the critical value is 70 - z * (σ/√n). So if the critical value is higher (closer to 70), then the area to the left of it (where we reject H0) is larger. So the sample mean must be less than this value to reject H0.

So a higher critical value (i.e., less negative) makes it easier to reject H0 when the true mean is 65. So, for the true mean of 65, the probability that the sample mean is less than the critical value is higher when the critical value is higher.

So, the higher the critical value, the higher the power, because the area under the sampling distribution curve (centered at 65) to the left of the critical value increases.

Thus, the critical value is 70 - z_alpha * (σ/√n).

We can see that for a given n, a higher alpha (which means a lower z_alpha, because z_alpha is the critical value from the standard normal distribution for a left-tail test) would lead to a higher critical value.

Wait, z-scores for left-tailed tests: for α=0.05, z is -1.645, for α=0.10, z is -1.282. So yes, higher alpha means a higher (less negative) z value, which makes the critical value higher.

So, for higher alpha and higher n, (σ/√n) is smaller, so the term z_alpha*(σ/√n) is smaller, making the critical value closer to 70.

Wait, but the critical value is 70 - z_alpha*(σ/√n). So with higher n, the second term is smaller, so the critical value is closer to 70.

So, higher n makes the critical value higher (closer to 70), which is better for detecting a true mean of 65, because the critical value being higher means that more sample means will fall below it, thus higher power.

Similarly, higher alpha makes the critical value higher.

So both higher alpha and higher n lead to higher critical values, which increase power.

Therefore, the option with the highest alpha and highest n will have the highest power.

Looking back, option I has alpha=0.1 (highest) and n=45 (highest). So that's the best.

Wait, but let's make sure. Let's compare with other options.

Option F: alpha=0.1, n=30. So same alpha as I, but smaller n. So I is better.

Option C: alpha=0.05, n=45. So same n as I, but lower alpha. So I is better.

So yes, I is the best.

Therefore, the correct answer is option I.

To determine which combination of significance level (α) and sample size (n) results in the greatest power of the test when μ = 65, we analyze the relationship between α, n, and power. Power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true, and it increases with both higher α and larger n:

1. **Effect of α**: A higher α increases the critical value (closer to the null mean, μ₀ = 70), making it easier to reject H₀ when the true mean is 65. This increases power.
2. **Effect of n**: A larger sample size reduces the standard error (σ/√n), also increasing power by making the sampling distribution more precise.

Given μ₀ = 70, μₐ = 65, and the options provided, the power is maximized when α is highest and n is largest. Among the options:

- **Option I (α = 0.1, n = 45)** has the highest α (0.1) and the largest n (45), making it the best choice.
- Other options with either lower α or smaller n (e.g., F: α = 0.1, n = 30; C: α = 0.05, n = 45) are less optimal.

Thus, the combination in **Option I** provides the greatest power.
