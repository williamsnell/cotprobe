Okay, so I have this question here about nuclear changes, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says: If two protons and two neutrons are removed from the nucleus of neon-20, a nucleus of which element remains? The options are from A to J.

Hmm. So I know that the atomic nucleus consists of protons and neutrons. The number of protons determines the element, right? Like, each element has a specific number of protons in its atoms. For example, hydrogen has 1 proton, helium 2, and so on.

Neon-20 must mean that the neon atom has 20 nucleons (protons + neutrons) in total. So I need to figure out how many protons and neutrons it originally has.

Wait, what's the atomic number of neon? I think it's 10. Because the periodic table says neon is element 10. So that means each neon atom has 10 protons. So in neon-20, the number of neutrons would be 20 - 10 = 10 neutrons.

Now the question says that two protons and two neutrons are removed. So let's calculate the new numbers.

Original protons: 10
After removing 2: 10 - 2 = 8 protons.

Original neutrons: 10
After removing 2: 10 - 2 = 8 neutrons.

So the new nucleus has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. Wait, the total nucleons would be 8 + 8 = 16. So the mass number is 16.

Now, which element has 8 protons? Oh right, oxygen! Because oxygen's atomic number is 8. So the element is oxygen, and the isotope has a mass number of 16.

Looking at the options, let me see. The options are:

A: Magnesium-18 (Mg is 12, so 12 protons)
B: Neon-16 (10 protons)
C: Mg-16 (12)
D: Oxygen-22 (O with 22 mass)
E: Neon-18 (10)
F: Mg-22 (12)
G: Oxygen-20 (O with 20 mass)
H: Mg-20 (12)
I: Oxygen-16 (O with 16 mass)
J: Oxygen-18 (O with 18)

So the nucleus after removal has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, making it oxygen-16. So I'm looking for an option where the element is oxygen and the mass number is 16.

Looking through the options, option I is Oxygen-16. So the correct answer should be I.

Wait, let me double-check. Neon-20 has 10 protons, 10 neutrons. Remove 2 protons and 2 neutrons. 10-2=8 protons (so oxygen). Neutrons 10-2=8. So total nucleons 16. Yep, oxygen-16. So option I is correct.
</think>

To determine the remaining nucleus after removing two protons and two neutrons from neon-20, we start by analyzing its composition. Neon has an atomic number of 10, meaning it has 10 protons. Since the mass number of neon-20 is 20, it also has 10 neutrons (20 - 10 = 10 neutrons).

When two protons and two neutrons are removed:

- The new number of protons becomes \( 10 - 2 = 8 \), which corresponds to oxygen (atomic number 8).
- The new number of neutrons becomes \( 10 - 2 = 8 \).
- The total number of nucleons (mass number) is \( 8 + 8 = 16 \).

Thus, the resulting nucleus is oxygen-16. Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

**I: Oxygen-16**

Answer: I
