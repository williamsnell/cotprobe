Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about Paul maximizing his utility from buying Twinkies and soda. Let me think through this step by step. 

First, I know that utility is given by the function U(t, s) = sqrt(ts). So the utility depends on the square root of the product of Twinkies (t) and soda (s). 

Paul's mom gives him $1 each day. The costs are $0.10 per Twinkie and $0.25 per soda. So I need to figure out how he can spend that dollar to get the most utility.

I remember that to maximize utility, we should look for the combination of goods that gives the highest utility possible given the budget constraint. This usually involves finding the point where the marginal utilities per dollar are equal for both goods.

Let me write down the budget constraint. Each Twinkie costs 0.10 dollars, so 0.10t, and each soda costs 0.25 dollars, so 0.25s. The total can't exceed $1. So the equation is:

0.10t + 0.25s = 1

I think I should express one variable in terms of the other to substitute into the utility function. Let me solve for s in terms of t.

0.25s = 1 - 0.10t  
s = (1 - 0.10t) / 0.25  
s = 4*(1 - 0.10t)  
s = 4 - 0.4t

Wait, wait, let me check that math again. 1 divided by 0.25 is 4, yes. So 0.10t divided by 0.25 is 0.4t. So yes, s equals 4 minus 0.4t.

Now, substitute s into the utility function:

U(t) = sqrt(t * (4 - 0.4t))  
= sqrt(4t - 0.4t^2)

Hmm, that looks right. So now, to find the maximum utility, I should take the derivative of U with respect to t and set it to zero.

But wait, maybe taking the derivative of the utility function squared would be easier because the square root can complicate things. Let me think: since the square root is a monotonically increasing function, maximizing U is the same as maximizing U squared. So I can avoid dealing with the square root in the derivative.

So let me define U_squared = ts = t*(4 - 0.4t) = 4t - 0.4t^2

Now, take the derivative of U_squared with respect to t:

d(U_squared)/dt = 4 - 0.8t

Set this equal to zero for maximization:

4 - 0.8t = 0  
0.8t = 4  
t = 4 / 0.8  
t = 5

Wait, that can't be right. According to this, t is 5. But let me double-check my calculations. The derivative of 4t is 4, and the derivative of -0.4t^2 is -0.8t. So setting 4 - 0.8t = 0 gives t=5. Hmm.

But wait, let's think about the budget. If t is 5, then the cost for Twinkies is 0.10 *5 = $0.50. Then s would be (1 - 0.50)/0.25 = 0.50 / 0.25 = 2. So s=2. So total cost is 0.5 + 0.5 = 1, which fits the budget.

But wait, I'm looking at the options given. Let me check the options again. The options are A:1, B:2, C:9, D:4, E:7, F:8, G:5, H:6, I:3, J:0.

So G is 5, which is the t I calculated. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you maximize utility, you might have to check integer values since you can't buy a fraction of a Twinkie or soda.

Wait, let me make sure that t=5 is indeed the maximum. Let's test t=4 and t=5 and t=6.

At t=5, s=2. So utility is sqrt(5*2)=sqrt(10)= approx 3.16.

At t=4, s=4 -0.4*4=4-1.6=2.4. So utility is sqrt(4*2.4)=sqrt(9.6)= approx 3.098, which is less than at t=5.

At t=6, s=4 -0.4*6=4-2.4=1.6. So utility is sqrt(6*1.6)=sqrt(9.6)= same as t=4, about 3.098.

So t=5 gives higher utility. So the answer should be G:5. But wait, the options include G as 5. So that's the choice.

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me recheck the budget equation.

The budget is 0.10t + 0.25s =1. So s= (1 -0.10t)/0.25. So when t=5, s=(1-0.50)/0.25=0.5/0.25=2, correct. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps we should use marginal utilities. The marginal utility of t (MU_t) is derivative of U with respect to t: (1/(2*sqrt(ts)))*s. Similarly, MU_s is (1/(2*sqrt(ts)))*t.

The optimal condition is MU_t / price_t = MU_s / price_s.

So MU_t = s/(2*sqrt(ts)) = sqrt(s/(2t)).

MU_s = t/(2*sqrt(ts)) = sqrt(t/(2s)).

So the condition is:

MU_t / 0.10 = MU_s / 0.25

Substituting,

[s/(2*sqrt(ts))] / 0.10 = [t/(2*sqrt(ts))] / 0.25

Simplify both sides. The 2*sqrt(ts) denominators cancel out.

So (s/0.10) = (t/0.25)

Because 2*sqrt(ts) cancels, so we have (s)/(0.10) = (t)/(0.25)

Which simplifies to s/(1/10) = t/(1/4) → 10s =4t → 5s=2t → s=(2/5)t.

So s=0.4t.

Now, substitute this into the budget equation.

0.10t + 0.25*(0.4t) = 1

0.10t + 0.10t =1 → 0.20t=1 → t=5.

Yes, same result. So t=5 is correct.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option G is 5. So the correct answer should be G.

Wait a second, but in the initial substitution approach, I found t=5, which is in the options as G. So that's the answer.

But wait, another possibility: sometimes when dealing with discrete goods, the maximum might be at a slightly different point. Let me check t=5 and see what the utility is, and compare it with nearby integers.

At t=5, s=2. Utility is sqrt(5*2)=sqrt(10)=~3.162.

At t=4, s= (1 -0.4)/0.25= (0.6)/0.25=2.4. Utility is sqrt(4*2.4)=sqrt(9.6)=~3.098.

At t=6, s= (1 -0.6)/0.25=0.4/0.25=1.6. Utility sqrt(6*1.6)=sqrt(9.6)=~3.098.

So yes, t=5 gives the highest utility among these. So the correct answer is G:5.

To determine how many Twinkies Paul should buy to maximize his utility, we start with the utility function:

\[
U(t, s) = \sqrt{ts}
\]

subject to the budget constraint:

\[
0.10t + 0.25s = 1
\]

### Step 1: Express \( s \) in terms of \( t \)
From the budget constraint:

\[
0.25s = 1 - 0.10t \quad \Rightarrow \quad s = \frac{1 - 0.10t}{0.25} = 4 - 0.4t
\]

### Step 2: Substitute \( s \) into the utility function
Substituting \( s = 4 - 0.4t \) into \( U(t, s) \):

\[
U(t) = \sqrt{t(4 - 0.4t)} = \sqrt{4t - 0.4t^2}
\]

To simplify maximization, consider the squared utility function:

\[
U_{\text{squared}} = 4t - 0.4t^2
\]

### Step 3: Take the derivative and maximize
Take the derivative of \( U_{\text{squared}} \) with respect to \( t \):

\[
\frac{dU_{\text{squared}}}{dt} = 4 - 0.8t
\]

Set the derivative equal to zero to find the optimal \( t \):

\[
4 - 0.8t = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad t = \frac{4}{0.8} = 5
\]

### Step 4: Verify the budget constraint
If \( t = 5 \), then:

\[
0.10(5) + 0.25s = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 0.50 + 0.25s = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad s = 2
\]

This satisfies the budget constraint.

### Step 5: Check utility for nearby values
To confirm \( t = 5 \) maximizes utility, calculate \( U(t, s) \) for \( t = 4, 5, 6 \):

- At \( t = 5 \), \( s = 2 \): \( U = \sqrt{5 \cdot 2} = \sqrt{10} \approx 3.16 \)
- At \( t = 4 \), \( s = 2.4 \): \( U = \sqrt{4 \cdot 2.4} = \sqrt{9.6} \approx 3.10 \)
- At \( t = 6 \), \( s = 1.6 \): \( U = \sqrt{6 \cdot 1.6} = \sqrt{9.6} \approx 3.10 \)

Thus, \( t = 5 \) provides the highest utility.

### Final Answer:
The optimal number of Twinkies Paul should buy is **5**.
