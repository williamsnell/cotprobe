Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about ethical psychology, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me start by understanding the scenario.

So, the situation is that a colleague, who's a licensed psychologist, tells me that he's just ended a sexual relationship with one of his clients. And I realize that this client is someone I referred to him about 18 months ago. Now, I need to decide what the ethical response should be.

Hmm, I remember that in psychology, there are strict ethical guidelines about therapists having sexual relationships with their clients. It's a big no-no because it can exploit the power dynamic and harm the client. So the colleague has definitely violated ethical standards here.

The question is asking what I, as an ethical psychologist, should do in this situation. Let's look at the options:

Option A: Advise the colleague to inform the Ethics Committee himself. So, telling him to self-report. That could be a possibility, but I'm not sure if that's the most appropriate because it relies on him taking action, and he might not follow through.

Option B: Contact the local authorities and report the colleague. I'm not certain if this is the right step. I think reporting to the Ethics Committee is more standard unless a crime has been committed. Unless the sexual relationship involves some illegality, like if the client was a minor, then authorities would be needed. But the question doesn't specify that, so maybe B isn't the first step.

Option C: Advise the colleague to apologize to the client. Apologizing might be part of the process, but it doesn't address the ethical violation. It's more about damage control rather than addressing the professional misconduct.

Option D: File a complaint against the colleague immediately with the Ethics Committee. This seems like a direct approach. If I'm certain that an ethical violation has occurred, then reporting it would be appropriate. But I should consider if there's any other step I should take first, like confronting the colleague.

Option E: Ignore the matter as it's not your responsibility. Clearly, this is unethical. As a colleague, I have a duty to uphold professional standards, so ignoring it isn't an option.

Option F: Inform the Ethics Committee without notifying the colleague. This is about reporting directly without telling him. I'm not sure if this is better than option D, which is filing a complaint. Filing a complaint is a formal process, so maybe D is the same as F. Or perhaps F is more about informing without the colleague's knowledge.

Option G: Contact the client and discuss the matter with her. I'm not sure if that's appropriate. It might interfere with the client's privacy and could complicate things. Plus, the client might not want to get involved, and it's not my place to intervene directly in their therapeutic relationship.

Option H: Discuss the matter with other colleagues to seek their advice. While consulting others can be helpful, it might delay taking necessary action. It could also lead to breaches of confidentiality if not handled carefully.

Option I: Discuss the matter further with the colleague to see what course of action he plans to take. This seems like a reasonable first step. Maybe the colleague is unaware of the ethical implications or is willing to take responsibility. Talking to him might lead to him self-reporting or taking corrective action. However, if he doesn't take it seriously, then I would need to take further steps.

So, putting this together, the ethical guidelines probably require reporting such violations. But the question is about what I should do as the colleague. The options are between advising him to report himself, filing a complaint, or discussing it with him first.

I think the correct approach is to first talk to the colleague. Maybe he's in a difficult situation and didn't realize the implications. If he's willing to address it, that's better. But if he's not, then I would have to take it further.

So, looking at the options, I is to discuss further with him. But option D is to file a complaint immediately. What's the right step?

In ethical guidelines, if a colleague is violating ethics, you might have a duty to report. But sometimes, informal resolution is possible if the colleague is willing to correct the behavior. However, in cases of serious violations like this, especially involving exploitation, the duty to protect the client and uphold standards may require reporting regardless.

Wait, I think the correct procedure is to first confront the colleague if possible, but if that doesn't lead to appropriate action, then report. Alternatively, some guidelines say that you must report without exception when there's a serious violation.

I'm a bit confused now. Let me think again. The colleague has ended the relationship, but the fact that it happened is a serious breach. So, as an ethical psychologist, I have a duty to report this to the Ethics Committee. So, the appropriate action would be to file a complaint, which is option D.

Alternatively, if I discuss with the colleague first (option I), maybe he would then report himself, which could be better for everyone involved. But if he doesn't, then I have to take action.

But the question is what should I do as the ethical psychologist. So, perhaps the immediate step is to file the complaint because the violation is clear and serious. So, the answer would be D.

Wait, but some might argue that you should try to address it with the colleague first, as in option I, to give them a chance to correct their behavior. But in this scenario, the colleague has already ended the relationship. So, the damage is done. Therefore, the appropriate action is to report to the Ethics Committee.

So, the correct answer is D: file a complaint against the colleague immediately with the Ethics Committee.

The scenario involves a colleague, a licensed psychologist, who has admitted to ending a sexual relationship with a client referred by the respondent 18 months earlier. This constitutes a serious ethical violation, as sexual relationships between therapists and clients are strictly prohibited due to the exploitative nature of the power dynamic. The question asks what the ethical psychologist should do in response.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Advising the colleague to self-report to the Ethics Committee relies on the colleague taking responsibility, but this may not ensure accountability if the colleague does not follow through.
- **Option B**: Contacting local authorities is typically reserved for criminal violations, which are not explicitly mentioned here, making this less appropriate.
- **Option C**: Suggesting an apology to the client does not address the ethical violation or ensure accountability.
- **Option D**: Filing a complaint with the Ethics Committee is a direct and appropriate response to a serious ethical breach, ensuring accountability and protecting future clients.
- **Option E**: Ignoring the matter is unethical, as it fails to uphold professional standards and protect clients.
- **Option F**: Informing the Ethics Committee without notifying the colleague is similar to filing a complaint but may lack the formality of a structured complaint process.
- **Option G**: Contacting the client could interfere with privacy and is not the responsibility of the respondent in this context.
- **Option H**: Consulting other colleagues may delay action and could breach confidentiality.
- **Option I**: Discussing the matter with the colleague first could provide an opportunity for informal resolution but may not be sufficient given the seriousness of the violation.

Given the severity of the ethical breach, the most appropriate and ethical response is to file a formal complaint with the Ethics Committee immediately, ensuring accountability and upholding professional standards.
