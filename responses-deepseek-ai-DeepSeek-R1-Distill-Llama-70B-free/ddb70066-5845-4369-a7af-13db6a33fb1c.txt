Question:

Ultra Co. uses a periodic inventory system. The following are inventory transactions for the month of January: 1/1 Beginning inventory 20000 units at $13 1/20 Purchase 30000 units at $15 1/23 Purchase 40000 units at $17 1/31 Sales at $20 per unit 50000 units Ultra uses the LIFO method to determine the value of its inventory. What amount should Ultra report as cost of goods sold on its income statement for the month of January?

Options:

A: $810,000
B: 1000000
C: $1,030,000
D: $830,000
E: $1,100,000
F: $870,000
G: $750,000
H: $950,000
I: $710,000
J: $910,000

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about calculating the cost of goods sold (COGS) for Ultra Co. using the LIFO method. Hmm, okay, I remember that LIFO stands for Last-In, First-Out, which means the most recent inventory is sold first. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I need to think carefully.

First, let's list out all the transactions given:

1. Beginning inventory on 1/1: 20,000 units at $13 each.
2. Purchase on 1/20: 30,000 units at $15.
3. Purchase on 1/23: 40,000 units at $17.
4. Sales on 1/31: 50,000 units at $20 each.

We're using a periodic inventory system, so we don't track each sale but instead calculate everything at the end of the period. So, the COGS will be based on the units sold and the cost of those units under LIFO.

Let me break this down. The total units available for sale are the beginning inventory plus the two purchases. So, that's 20,000 + 30,000 + 40,000 = 90,000 units.

They sold 50,000 units, so the ending inventory would be 90,000 - 50,000 = 40,000 units.

Under LIFO, the units sold are considered to come from the most recent purchases first. So, to calculate COGS, I need to determine which layers of inventory are being sold.

Let me list the inventory in the order they were purchased:

1. Beginning inventory: 20,000 units @ $13.
2. 1/20 purchase: 30,000 units @ $15.
3. 1/23 purchase: 40,000 units @ $17.

Since sales are 50,000 units, the LIFO method would assume that the first units sold are from the most recent purchase, then the earlier ones.

So, let's see how much is taken from each layer:

- Start with the 1/23 purchase of 40,000 units. Since we sold 50,000, we'll take all 40,000 from this layer. That leaves 50,000 - 40,000 = 10,000 units to be taken from the previous layer.

The next layer is the 1/20 purchase of 30,000 units. We need 10,000 units from here.

So, the COGS will consist of:

- 40,000 units @ $17 = 40,000 * 17 = $680,000
- 10,000 units @ $15 = 10,000 * 15 = $150,000

Adding these together: 680,000 + 150,000 = $830,000.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The beginning inventory is 20,000 units. But since we only needed 10,000 from the 1/20 purchase, the remaining 20,000 from the beginning inventory would still be in stock, right?

So, the total COGS should be $680k + $150k = $830k. Looking at the options, option D is $830,000, so that should be the correct answer.

To calculate the cost of goods sold (COGS) for Ultra Co. using the LIFO method, we analyze the inventory transactions for January:

1. **Beginning Inventory**: 20,000 units at $13.
2. **Purchase on 1/20**: 30,000 units at $15.
3. **Purchase on 1/23**: 40,000 units at $17.
4. **Sales on 1/31**: 50,000 units at $20.

Under LIFO, the most recent inventory is sold first. Total units available for sale are:

\[
20,000 + 30,000 + 40,000 = 90,000 \text{ units.}
\]

After selling 50,000 units, the ending inventory is:

\[
90,000 - 50,000 = 40,000 \text{ units.}
\]

The COGS is calculated by assigning the 50,000 units sold to the most recent purchases:

1. **1/23 Purchase**: 40,000 units are entirely sold.
   \[
   40,000 \times 17 = \$680,000.
   \]

2. **1/20 Purchase**: The remaining 10,000 units are sold.
   \[
   10,000 \times 15 = \$150,000.
   \]

Total COGS:

\[
680,000 + 150,000 = \$830,000.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**D: \$830,000**
