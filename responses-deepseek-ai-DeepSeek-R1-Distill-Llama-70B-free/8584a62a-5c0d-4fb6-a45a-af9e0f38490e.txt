Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Assume this question takes place in a "lien theory" state. A woman and her co-habiting partner share a property as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. He has run up debts that he did not tell her about, and so he uses his interest in the property to secretly get a mortgage from the bank. When he dies, the bank attempts to execute on the mortgage. Can it do so? Apply the majority view on this issue.

Options:

A: No, the mortgage lien could not destroy the joint tenancy, and when the partner dies, the property passes by operation of law to the surviving joint tenant.
B: No, although the mortgage destroyed the joint tenancy, the bank has to get a deed of trust in order to execute on jointly owned property.
C: Yes, the bank got title to the property by virtue of the mortgage, which destroyed the joint tenancy, and it can execute on its lien.
D: Yes, the mortgage was the equivalent of a deed of trust and the joint tenancy was severed by the mortgage lien, giving the bank unfettered legal authority to execute on its mortgage.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about property law, specifically dealing with joint tenancy and mortgages in a lien theory state. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand the scenario. A woman and her cohabiting partner own a property as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. That means they both own the property together, and when one dies, the other automatically gets the deceased's share without going through probate.

The partner has debts he didn't tell her about, and he secretly gets a mortgage from the bank using his interest in the property. Now, when he dies, the bank is trying to execute on the mortgage. The question is whether the bank can do that, under the majority view in a lien theory state.

I remember that in property law, joint tenancy has the four unities: time, title, interest, and possession. If any of these are broken, the joint tenancy can be severed. Also, when one joint tenant mortgages their interest, it can affect the joint tenancy.

In a lien theory state, a mortgage is treated as a lien against the property rather than transferring legal title to the lender. So when the partner took out the mortgage, he was using his interest in the property as collateral. But since it's a lien, it doesn't transfer ownership.

Now, when he dies, under joint tenancy, the woman would normally get his share automatically. But because he mortgaged his interest, the bank might have a claim on that share.

Wait, but the mortgage was only on his interest, right? So when he dies, does the mortgage get extinguished, or does it attach to the woman's interest?

I think that when a joint tenant mortgages their interest, it doesn't sever the joint tenancy entirely but rather affects only their own interest. So upon the death of the mortgaging tenant, the mortgage would still apply to the deceased's interest, but since the woman takes the entire property by survivorship, does the mortgage lien carry over?

Alternatively, if the mortgage severed the joint tenancy, then upon death, the woman and the bank (or the partner's estate) would own the property as tenants in common, and the bank could foreclose on the partner's share.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. In some jurisdictions, a mortgage by one joint tenant severs the joint tenancy, converting it into a tenancy in common. If that's the case, then upon the partner's death, the woman would own half, and the bank could execute on the partner's half.

However, the majority view is that a mortgage by one joint tenant does not sever the joint tenancy but only affects the mortgaging tenant's interest. So when the partner dies, the woman takes the entire property, but the bank can still execute on the deceased's interest, which would require the woman to pay off the mortgage or face foreclosure.

Wait, no, because in a lien theory state, the mortgage is a lien on the title. So when the partner dies, the woman owns the entire property, but the lien would still be on her title. Or does the lien only apply to the deceased's interest, which is now gone?

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again. So in a lien theory state, the mortgage is a lien on the title. If the joint tenant mortgages his interest, upon his death, his interest passes to the survivor. But the mortgage was on his interest while he was alive. So does the lien attach to the survivor's interest now?

I think that in the majority view, when a joint tenant mortgages their interest, the lien attaches only to their own interest. Upon death, the survivor takes the entire property, but the lien would still affect the property because the mortgagee's interest (the bank) is in the property. Alternatively, the lien might only be on the deceased's share, which is now part of the survivor's ownership.

Wait, but if the joint tenancy wasn't severed, then the survivor owns 100%, so the bank's mortgage would have to be satisfied from the entire property. So the bank can execute on the entire property because the lien attached to the title when the mortgage was taken.

Alternatively, maybe the mortgage doesn't affect the survivor's interest because the joint tenancy wasn't severed. So the bank can't execute because the lien only applied to the deceased's interest, which no longer exists.

I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to approach this differently. 

In a lien theory state, when a joint tenant takes a mortgage, it's treated as a lien on their interest. When they die, their interest passes to the survivor. But does the lien survive the death?

I think that the lien would survive because it's attached to the title. So the bank can still enforce the lien against the entire property, even though the ownership has passed to the survivor. Because the lien is on the property, not just the individual's interest.

Wait, but if the mortgage was only on the partner's interest, and that interest ceases to exist upon death, then the bank's lien would only be on that specific interest, which is now gone. So the bank can't enforce against the survivor's interest.

Hmm. I think the majority view is that a mortgage by one joint tenant does not sever the joint tenancy but subjects the entire property to the lien. Because when the mortgaging tenant dies, the survivorship kicks in, but the lien remains on the property.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another angle: In a lien theory state, a mortgage is a lien on the legal title. So when the partner took out the mortgage, he gave the bank a lien on his interest. But upon his death, his interest ceases to exist, and the woman owns the entire property. So the bank's lien would be on the portion that the partner owned, which is now part of the woman's ownership. Therefore, the bank can execute on the entire property because the lien attaches to the whole.

Alternatively, the lien only applies to the partner's share, which is now extinguished, so the bank can't enforce.

I'm getting more confused. Let me try to recall any cases or principles. I remember that when a joint tenant mortgages their interest, the lien is on their interest, but upon death, the survivor takes the entire property, and the lien may still be enforceable against the property because the debt was incurred by the deceased, and the survivor's interest is subject to the lien.

Wait, but in a joint tenancy, the survivor's interest is not separate; they own the entire property. So the bank's lien would have to attach to the entire property, but since the mortgage was only on the partner's interest, I'm not sure.

Perhaps the correct approach is that the mortgage by one joint tenant severs the joint tenancy. If that's the case, then upon the partner's death, the woman would own half, and the bank could execute on the partner's half. But if the majority view is that it doesn't sever, then the bank can't execute because the survivor owns everything, and the lien was only on the partner's interest, which is gone.

Wait, I think the majority view is that a mortgage by one joint tenant does not sever the joint tenancy but only affects their own interest. So when the partner dies, the woman owns the entire property, but the bank can still enforce the mortgage against the property because the lien was attached when the mortgage was taken. So the bank can execute on the entire property.

Alternatively, the majority view might hold that the joint tenancy is severed by the mortgage, making them tenants in common. Then, upon death, the woman and the bank (as holder of the mortgage on the partner's share) would have ownership, and the bank can execute.

But wait, the options say:

Option A: No, the mortgage lien could not destroy the joint tenancy, and when the partner dies, the property passes by operation of law to the surviving joint tenant.

Option C: Yes, the bank got title to the property by virtue of the mortgage, which destroyed the joint tenancy, and it can execute on its lien.

Wait, but the mortgage doesn't transfer title in a lien theory state. So option C might be incorrect because the mortgage is a lien, not a transfer of title.

So perhaps the correct answer is A, because the joint tenancy wasn't severed, and the bank can't execute because the lien only applied to the partner's interest, which is now gone.

But wait, some sources say that a mortgage by one joint tenant does not sever the joint tenancy but does create a lien that can be foreclosed upon the interest of the mortgaging tenant. Upon death, the survivor takes the entire property, but the lien would still encumber the property because the mortgage was on the title.

Wait, but in a lien theory state, the mortgage is a lien on the title. So when the partner took the mortgage, the lien attached to the property. When he dies, the woman owns the entire property, but the lien remains, so the bank can execute on the entire property.

So the answer would be C: Yes, the bank can execute because the mortgage lien was on the property, which the woman now owns entirely but is still subject to the lien.

Wait, but option C says the mortgage destroyed the joint tenancy, which I'm not sure about. If the mortgage didn't sever the joint tenancy, then the lien is still on the property. So perhaps the majority view is that the lien survives, allowing the bank to execute.

Alternatively, some jurisdictions hold that the mortgage does not affect the joint tenancy, so the bank can't execute because the lien only applied to the deceased's interest, which is now part of the survivor's ownership, but perhaps the survivor isn't liable for the debt.

Wait, but the bank's lien is on the property, so even if the survivor isn't personally liable, the lien is on the property, so the bank can foreclose.

I think the majority view is that the mortgage by one joint tenant does not sever the joint tenancy but the lien remains on the property. So when the partner dies, the woman owns the entire property, but the bank can still execute on the lien because it's attached to the property. So the answer would be C.

Wait, but option C says the mortgage destroyed the joint tenancy. So if the mortgage didn't sever it, then option C is incorrect.

Hmm. Maybe the majority view is that the mortgage does not sever the joint tenancy, so the bank can't execute because the lien only applied to the partner's interest, which is now owned by the woman. But the bank can still foreclose on the entire property because the lien is on the title.

Alternatively, I'm getting confused. Let me try to find the correct approach.

In a lien theory state, a mortgage is a lien on the property. When a joint tenant mortgages their interest, the lien attaches to their interest. Upon death, the survivor takes the entire property, but the lien remains on the survivor's title. So the bank can execute on the entire property.

Wait, but that would mean the mortgage didn't sever the joint tenancy, but the lien survives. So the answer would be that the bank can execute, but the reason is that the lien is still on the property, not that the joint tenancy was destroyed.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the mortgage couldn't destroy the joint tenancy, so the property passes to the survivor. But this would imply the bank can't execute, which may not be correct because the lien remains.

Option C says the mortgage destroyed the joint tenancy, giving the bank title. But in a lien theory state, the mortgage doesn't transfer title, so this is incorrect.

Wait, option C says the bank got title, which is incorrect because in a lien theory state, the mortgage is a lien, not a transfer. So option C is wrong.

Then, perhaps the correct answer is A, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the majority view is that the mortgage by one joint tenant does not sever the joint tenancy, so upon death, the survivor takes the entire property, and the bank can't execute because the lien was only on the deceased's interest, which is now gone.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the lien is on the property, not just the interest. So maybe the bank can still execute.

I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of it another way. In a lien theory state, when a joint tenant mortgages their interest, it creates a lien on their interest. Upon death, the survivor takes the entire property, but the lien would still be on the title, meaning the bank can foreclose on the property.

So in that case, the answer would be that the bank can execute, but the options don't directly state that. Let's look again.

Option A: No, mortgage lien couldn't destroy joint tenancy, survivor gets property.

Option C: Yes, mortgage destroyed joint tenancy, bank can execute.

But if the mortgage didn't destroy the joint tenancy, then the survivor owns the entire property, but the lien is still on it. So the bank can execute on the entire property, meaning the answer would be yes, but the reason isn't that the joint tenancy was destroyed.

Wait, but none of the options exactly say that. Option C is about the mortgage destroying the joint tenancy, which may not be accurate in a lien theory state.

Alternatively, perhaps the majority view is that the mortgage by one joint tenant does not sever the joint tenancy, so upon death, the survivor owns the property, but the bank can still execute on the mortgage because the lien is on the property. So the answer would be yes, but the reason is the lien survives, not that the joint tenancy was severed.

But looking at the options, option A says no, the bank can't execute, which would be incorrect if the lien survives.

Wait, perhaps the majority view is that the mortgage does not sever the joint tenancy, so the survivor gets the property, and the bank can't execute because the lien was only on the deceased's interest, which is now part of the survivor's ownership, but the survivor isn't personally liable.

I'm getting more confused. I think I need to remember that in a lien theory state, when a joint tenant mortgages their interest, the lien is on their interest, but upon death, the survivor takes the entire property, and the bank can still execute on the lien against the entire property.

So the answer would be yes, the bank can execute. Looking at the options, that's option C or D.

Option C says the mortgage destroyed the joint tenancy, giving the bank title. But in a lien theory state, the mortgage is a lien, not a transfer, so the bank doesn't get title. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: Yes, the mortgage was equivalent to a deed of trust, severing the joint tenancy, giving the bank authority.

Wait, a deed of trust is different from a mortgage. In a lien theory state, a mortgage creates a lien, while a deed of trust transfers legal title to a trustee. So perhaps option D is incorrect because the mortgage isn't a deed of trust.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is A, because the mortgage didn't sever the joint tenancy, so the survivor takes the property, and the bank can't execute.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the majority view is that the mortgage by one joint tenant does not sever the joint tenancy, so the survivor takes the entire property, but the bank can still enforce the lien against the property because the lien is still attached.

So the answer would be yes, the bank can execute, but the reason is that the lien remains, not that the joint tenancy was severed.

Looking at the options, the only yes options are C and D. But both C and D suggest that the joint tenancy was severed, which may not be accurate.

Wait, perhaps in the majority view, the mortgage by one joint tenant does not sever the joint tenancy, so the survivor takes the property, but the bank's lien is still valid against the property. So the answer would be yes, but none of the options exactly match that.

Wait, perhaps the answer is A: No, the mortgage lien couldn't destroy the joint tenancy, so the survivor gets the property, and the bank can't execute. But that doesn't make sense because the lien is on the property.

I'm really stuck. I think I'll have to go with the majority view that a mortgage by one joint tenant does not sever the joint tenancy, so the survivor takes the entire property, but the bank can still execute on the mortgage because the lien is on the property. So the answer would be yes, but looking at the options, perhaps option C is the closest, even though it mentions destroying the joint tenancy, which might not be accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the majority view is that the mortgage does not affect the joint tenancy, so the bank can't execute because the lien only applied to the deceased's interest, which is now gone. So the answer would be A.

I think I've heard that in a lien theory state, a mortgage by one joint tenant does not sever the joint tenancy, and upon death, the survivor takes the entire property, but the bank can still foreclose on the property because the lien was attached to the title. So the bank can execute, making the answer C or D.

But option C says the bank got title, which isn't correct in a lien theory state. So perhaps the answer is A, but I'm not certain.

I think I'll go with option A: No, the mortgage lien could not destroy the joint tenancy, and when the partner dies, the property passes by operation of law to the surviving joint tenant.

Wait, but that would mean the bank can't execute, which seems incorrect because the lien is still on the property.

I'm really not sure, but I'll go with option A because the majority view is that the mortgage doesn't sever the joint tenancy, so the survivor takes the property, and the bank can't execute because the lien only applied to the deceased's interest, which is now part of the survivor's ownership without the lien.

In a lien theory state, a mortgage creates a lien on the property rather than transferring legal title. When a joint tenant takes out a mortgage, the lien attaches to their interest in the property. However, the majority view is that a mortgage by one joint tenant does not sever the joint tenancy. This means that upon the death of the mortgaging tenant, the surviving joint tenant takes the entire property by operation of law under the right of survivorship.

The key issue is whether the bank can execute on the mortgage after the death of the mortgaging tenant. Since the mortgage lien is on the property, it could theoretically survive the death of the mortgaging tenant and encumber the entire property. However, the majority view holds that the lien does not automatically transfer to the surviving tenant's interest because the mortgage was only on the deceased tenant's interest, which ceases to exist upon death. Therefore, the bank cannot execute on the mortgage.

Option A aligns with this reasoning: the mortgage lien could not destroy the joint tenancy, and the property passes entirely to the surviving joint tenant by operation of law.
