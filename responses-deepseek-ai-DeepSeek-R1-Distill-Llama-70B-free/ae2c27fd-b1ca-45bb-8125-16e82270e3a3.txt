Okay, so I have this question here about compound interest rates. The question is asking for the effective rate when 3% is compounded monthly. Hmm, I remember that compound interest means that the interest is calculated on the initial principal and also on the accumulated interest from previous periods. 

Wait, right, the formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:
- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- P is the principal amount.
- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).
- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- t is the time the money is invested for in years.

But wait, the question isn't asking for the amount after a certain time. It's asking for the effective rate. Oh right! The effective annual rate (EAR) is the rate that would give the same return as compounding more frequently. So the formula for EAR when compounded monthly would be (1 + r/n)^n - 1.

So given that the rate is 3%, which is 0.03 in decimal. Compounded monthly means n is 12. So plugging into the formula: (1 + 0.03/12)^12 - 1.

Let me calculate that. First, 0.03 divided by 12 is 0.0025. Then 1 + 0.0025 is 1.0025. Now I need to raise this to the power of 12. 

Hmm, I don't have a calculator here, but I can approximate it. I remember that (1 + 0.0025)^12 is approximately e^(0.03) when n is large, but since n is 12, maybe I should compute it step by step.

Alternatively, I can think that 0.03 is 3%, so compounding it monthly. The effective rate is a bit higher than 3% because of the compounding effect.

Wait, let's think about the options given. The options are A through J, letters with numbers like 0.027, 0.0304, etc. So the correct answer should be just a bit over 3%, maybe around 3.04% or something.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. So (1.0025)^12. Let me compute this step by step.

I can recall that 1.0025^12 is approximately 1.0304... because each compounding adds a little each month. So the effective rate is 0.0304, which is 3.04%.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.0304. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but wait, did I mix up the numbers correctly? Let me double-check. The rate is 3%, so 0.03. Divided by 12 is 0.0025. Then 1.0025^12.

Another way to think: The formula for effective rate is (1 + r/n)^n - 1. So that's (1.0025)^12 - 1.

I remember that 1.0025^12 is about 1.0304. So 1.0304 minus 1 is 0.0304, so 3.04%, which is option B.

The effective annual rate (EAR) for 3% compounded monthly is calculated using the formula:

\[
EAR = \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^n - 1
\]

Here, \( r = 0.03 \) (the annual interest rate) and \( n = 12 \) (the number of compounding periods per year). Substituting the values:

\[
EAR = \left(1 + \frac{0.03}{12}\right)^{12} - 1
\]

First, calculate \( \frac{0.03}{12} = 0.0025 \). Then, \( 1 + 0.0025 = 1.0025 \). Raising this to the power of 12:

\[
(1.0025)^{12} \approx 1.0304
\]

Subtracting 1 gives:

\[
EAR = 1.0304 - 1 = 0.0304
\]

Thus, the effective rate is 0.0304, which corresponds to option B.
