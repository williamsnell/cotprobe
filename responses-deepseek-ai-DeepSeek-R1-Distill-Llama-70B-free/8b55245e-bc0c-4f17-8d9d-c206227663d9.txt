Okay, so I've got this problem about banking reserves, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. Mr. Jones is the president of a bank, and he wants to check if they're holding too much reserves against their demand deposits. The total deposits are $1,700,000, and the reserve ratio is 20%. The reserves they have are $850,000. The question is about the excess reserves, and the options are various numbers and percentages.

Hmm, I remember that banks are required to keep a certain percentage of their deposits as reserves. The reserve ratio is that percentage. So, required reserves would be the total deposits multiplied by the reserve ratio. Let me calculate that first.

Total deposits are $1,700,000, and the reserve ratio is 20%, which is 0.2 as a decimal. So, required reserves = 1,700,000 * 0.2. Let me do the math: 1,700,000 times 0.2 is 340,000. So the bank is required to hold $340,000 in reserves.

But wait, the bank actually has $850,000 in reserves. That's way more than the required amount. So the excess reserves would be the actual reserves minus the required reserves. So that's 850,000 minus 340,000, which equals 510,000. So the excess is $510,000.

Looking at the options, option F is $510,000. So the answer should be F.

Wait, did I do that right? Let me double-check. If reserves are $850k and required is 20% of 1,700k, which is 340k, then yes, 850-340 is 510. So yes, F is correct.

To determine the excess reserves, we first calculate the required reserves:

Required Reserves = Total Deposits × Reserve Ratio  
Required Reserves = $1,700,000 × 20% = $340,000  

The bank holds $850,000 in reserves. Excess reserves are the difference between actual reserves and required reserves:

Excess Reserves = Actual Reserves − Required Reserves  
Excess Reserves = $850,000 − $340,000 = $510,000  

Thus, the bank has $510,000 in excess reserves.

Answer: F
