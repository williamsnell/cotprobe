Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about the frequency of a gene for widow's peak, which is a dominant trait. The frequency given is 0.07. I need to find the frequencies of three groups: (a) persons homozygous for the trait, (b) those heterozygous, and (c) those who lack the trait.

Hmm, right. Widow's peak is dominant, so I'm dealing with a dominant allele. Let's denote the dominant allele as 'W' and the recessive as 'w'. So the possible genotypes are WW (homozygous dominant), Ww (heterozygous), and ww (homozygous recessive).

The frequency given is the allele frequency. Wait, wait. Oh, wait no, the question says the frequency of the gene for widow's peak is 0.07. Wait, wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, in genetics, the frequency is usually the allele frequency. So if the dominant allele (W) has a frequency of 0.07, then the recessive allele (w) would be 1 - 0.07, which is 0.93.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, that's not right. Wait, the problem says the frequency of the gene for widow's peak is 0.07. Oh, but is that the frequency of the dominant allele or the recessive? Wait, no, widow's peak is dominant, so the presence of the dominant allele (either homozygous or heterozygous) will express the trait.

Wait, but the question gives the frequency of the gene, which is the allele frequency. So if the dominant allele's frequency is 0.07, then the recessive is 0.93. Because allele frequencies must add up to 1.

Wait, but wait another thing. Sometimes people get confused between gene frequency and genotype frequency. Oh wait, no, in this context, the question is stating that the gene's frequency is 0.07. So yes, that's the allele frequency for the dominant allele, W, is 0.07.

So, let me outline what I know:

- p = frequency of dominant allele (W) = 0.07
- q = frequency of recessive allele (w) = 1 - p = 0.93

Now, genotype frequencies under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium are calculated as:

- Homozygous dominant (WW): p²
- Heterozygous (Ww): 2pq
- Homozygous recessive (ww): q²

So, for each part:

a) Persons homozygous for widow's peak (WW): p squared, which is 0.07^2.

Let me calculate that. 0.07 * 0.07 is 0.0049. So 0.0049.

b) Heterozygous (Ww): 2 * p * q.

So 2 * 0.07 * 0.93. Let me calculate that. 0.07 * 0.93 is 0.0651. Multiply by 2 gives 0.1302.

c) Persons lacking widow's peak. Since the trait is dominant, only those with ww genotype don't have it. So that's q squared, 0.93^2.

Calculating 0.93 squared: 0.93 * 0.93 = let's see. 0.9 * 0.9 is 0.81, 0.9 * 0.03 is 0.027, 0.03*0.9 is another 0.027, and 0.03*0.03 is 0.0009. Wait, perhaps a better way. 93 *93 is 8649. So 0.93 squared is 0.8649.

Wait, but wait, no: 0.93 * 0.93 is actually 0.8649, right. So part c is 0.8649.

Now, putting it all together:

a) 0.0049

b) 0.1302

c) 0.8649

Looking at the options:

Option C: (a) 0.0049, (b) 0.1302, (c) 0.8649. So that's a match.

Wait, let me check the other options just to be sure.

Option A: a is 0.0059, which is higher than our 0.0049. So no.

Option B: a is 0.0021, way lower. So no.

Option C is as we found.

Option D: a is 0.0098, which is higher.

Option E: a is 0.0081. No.

Option F: a is 0.0045, which is close but not exact. Also, b is 0.1305, which is a bit higher than 0.1302.

Option G: a is 0.0034. No.

Option H: a is 0.00049, way too small.

Option I: a is 0.0149, way higher.

Option J: a is 0.0064, also higher.

So the correct option is C.

To solve the problem, we use the Hardy-Weinberg principle, which relates allele frequencies to genotype frequencies. The frequency of the dominant allele (W) is given as 0.07, and the frequency of the recessive allele (w) is calculated as:

\[
q = 1 - p = 1 - 0.07 = 0.93
\]

The genotype frequencies are calculated as follows:

1. **Homozygous dominant (WW):**  
   \[
   p^2 = (0.07)^2 = 0.0049
   \]

2. **Heterozygous (Ww):**  
   \[
   2pq = 2(0.07)(0.93) = 0.1302
   \]

3. **Homozygous recessive (ww):**  
   \[
   q^2 = (0.93)^2 = 0.8649
   \]

Thus, the frequencies are:
- (a) Persons homozygous for widow's peak: \(0.0049\)
- (b) Persons heterozygous for widow's peak: \(0.1302\)
- (c) Persons lacking widow's peak: \(0.8649\)

Comparing these values with the options provided, the correct match is:

**Option C: (a) 0.0049, (b) 0.1302, (c) 0.8649**

C
