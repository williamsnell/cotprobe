Question:

A college student and her boyfriend lived together in a one-bedroom apartment in Los Angeles. They were engaged to be married when they purchased an undeveloped parcel of land on a hillside overlooking the Pacific. The deed, which was properly executed and recorded, named the student and the boyfriend as grantees, "not as tenants in common but as joint tenants with right of survivorship. "Thereafter, the boyfriend, who was experiencing financial difficulties, offered to sell the property to his co-worker. Without the student's knowledge, the boyfriend executed a deed that purported to convey the hillside property to the co-worker in fee simple. The boyfriend signed his name and forged the student's name. He then delivered the deed of conveyance to the co-worker, who paid the boyfriend $150,000, which was the fair market value of the property. The co-worker immediately recorded the deed received from the boyfriend. The common law joint tenancy is unmodified by statute. Title to the property in question is now in

Okay, so I've got this property law question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the scenario is about a college student and her boyfriend who bought some undeveloped land. They were engaged to be married and purchased this parcel together. The deed they got was properly executed and recorded, naming them both as grantees "not as tenants in common but as joint tenants with right of survivorship." So, I remember that joint tenancy means they both own the property together, and if one dies, the other gets the entire property automatically.

Then, the boyfriend, who's having financial trouble, decides to sell the property to his co-worker. But here's the catch: he does this without the student's knowledge. He executes a deed that's supposed to convey the property to the co-worker in fee simple. He signs his name and forges the student's name. Then, he delivers the deed to the co-worker, who pays him $150,000, which is the fair market value. The co-worker records the deed immediately.

The question is about who now holds title to the property. The options are from A to J.

Alright, let's break this down. I think the key points here are about joint tenancy and what happens when one joint tenant tries to convey the property without the other's consent.

From what I remember, in a joint tenancy, each joint tenant has an equal and undivided interest in the property. The right of survivorship means that if one dies, the other gets the whole property. But when a joint tenant sells or conveys their interest, it can affect the joint tenancy.

So, if one joint tenant sells their interest without the consent of the other, what happens? I think that in such a case, the joint tenancy is severed. But wait, how does that work exactly?

Wait, when a joint tenant transfers their interest, it can convert the joint tenancy into a tenancy in common as to that person's interest. But since joint tenancy requires all four unities (time, title, interest, possession), transferring an interest breaks one of those, I think. So the joint tenancy becomes a tenancy in common between the remaining parties.

But in this case, the boyfriend is trying to sell the entire property, not just his interest. He's forging the student's name, so he's making it look like both of them are selling. The deed he executed is supposed to convey the property to the co-worker in fee simple. So, the question is whether the co-worker gets the property, or does the student still retain some interest.

Hmm. So, under common law, when a joint tenant sells their interest, it severs the joint tenancy, and the buyer gets the interest of the selling joint tenant. But in this case, the boyfriend is trying to sell the entire property, not just his own interest. But he's doing it without the student's knowledge or consent, and he's forging her name.

Wait, so if the boyfriend forges the student's signature, is that deed valid? Well, a forged signature is not valid, right? So, in reality, only the boyfriend's interest is being transferred. Because the student didn't actually sign the deed, so her interest isn't being conveyed.

Wait, but the co-worker is a bona fide purchaser. He paid full value and recorded the deed. So, does the co-worker get any protection under the bona fide purchaser doctrine?

Wait, the bona fide purchaser (BFP) doctrine protects a purchaser who pays value without notice of prior claims. But in this case, the co-worker is dealing with the boyfriend, who's presenting a forged deed. But the co-worker might not know that the student's signature is forged. So, would the BFP doctrine apply here?

Wait, but the initial ownership was as joint tenants. So, when the boyfriend, as a joint tenant, tries to convey the property without the student's consent, what's the effect?

I think that when a joint tenant conveys their interest, it severs the joint tenancy, and the grantee (here, the co-worker) gets the interest that the joint tenant had. But since the joint tenancy is severed, the remaining interest would be as tenants in common.

Wait, but in this case, the boyfriend is trying to convey the entire property, not just his own interest. So, the deed he's executing is as if both he and the student are conveying. But since the student's signature is forged, only the boyfriend's interest is actually transferred.

So, the co-worker would get the boyfriend's interest, but the student's interest remains. However, because the joint tenancy has been severed, the co-worker and the student would now be tenants in common.

Wait, but how does the forged deed affect this? The co-worker takes the deed, which on its face appears to be a conveyance by both joint tenants. But since one signature is forged, the deed is only effective as to the boyfriend's interest. So, the co-worker gets the boyfriend's half, and the student still holds her half as a tenant in common.

But wait, the co-worker paid the full value of the property, so perhaps he's entitled to the entire property. But that doesn't seem right because he only got a forged deed from one of the joint tenants.

Wait, another angle: in joint tenancy, each has the right to the whole, but when one sells their interest, the buyer steps into their place. But if the buyer thinks they're buying the entire property because the deed says so, but in reality, they're only getting the boyfriend's half. Because the student's signature was forged, so her interest wasn't conveyed.

So, the co-worker would own the boyfriend's half, and the student would retain her half as a tenant in common. So, the title would be held by the co-worker and the student as tenants in common.

Looking at the options, option G is the co-worker and the student as tenants in common. Option D is the co-worker and the boyfriend as tenants in common. But since the co-worker bought from the boyfriend, the co-worker would have the boyfriend's share, so the co-worker and the student would each own half as tenants in common.

Wait, but is the co-worker protected by BFP status? If the co-worker didn't know about the forgery and paid full value, maybe they would take the entire property, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another point: when a joint tenant conveys their interest, the joint tenancy is severed, and the grantee takes as a tenant in common with the remaining joint tenant. So, the co-worker would take the boyfriend's interest, making the co-worker and the student tenants in common.

But if the co-worker thought they were buying the entire property, but in reality only got half, then the student still has her half. So, the co-worker and the student are tenants in common.

So, the correct answer would be G. But wait, let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the co-worker doesn't get anything because the deed was forged. But that doesn't make sense because the co-worker is a BFP. But wait, the BFP doctrine applies when the purchaser is without notice and pays value. But in this case, the problem states that the co-worker recorded the deed immediately. So, if the co-worker had no knowledge of the forgery and paid full value, they might take the property free of the student's interest.

Wait, but joint tenancy requires all four unities. If one joint tenant conveys their interest, the joint tenancy is severed, and the grantee becomes a tenant in common with the remaining joint tenant. So, the co-worker would get the boyfriend's half, making them and the student tenants in common.

But if the co-worker is a BFP, maybe they take the entire property because they have no notice of the student's interest. But wait, the original deed was recorded, so the co-worker would have constructive notice that the property was owned by both the student and the boyfriend as joint tenants. So, when the co-worker receives a deed from both, but one signature is forged, I'm not sure if the BFP doctrine would protect them.

Wait, but the co-worker would see that the deed is from both, and since it's recorded, they might think they have clear title. But if the student's signature was forged, then the deed is invalid as to her. So, the co-worker only gets the boyfriend's half.

So, the title is split between the co-worker (owning the boyfriend's half) and the student (owning her half), as tenants in common. So, option G.

But wait, another possibility: if the boyfriend conveys his interest without the student's consent, the joint tenancy is severed, and the co-worker gets the boyfriend's interest as a tenant in common. So the student and the co-worker become tenants in common. So the answer would be G.

Alternatively, if the co-worker is a BFP without notice, maybe he takes the entire property. But the original ownership was joint tenancy, and the co-worker's deed was from both, so maybe the BFP doctrine would protect him. Wait, but if the co-worker knew that the property was owned by two people, then he might have been on notice that both signatures were required. So, perhaps the BFP doctrine doesn't apply because the co-worker had inquiry notice.

Wait, the co-worker is a BFP because he paid full value and had no knowledge of the forgery. But does that mean he takes the entire property? Or just the boyfriend's interest?

In some states, a forged deed can be valid if the grantee is a BFP. Wait, but at common law, a forged deed is void, so even a BFP can't take. But some jurisdictions have moved away from that under recording acts.

Wait, under the common law, a forged deed is void. So, the co-worker's deed is void because the student's signature was forged. Therefore, the co-worker doesn't get any interest in the property, and the joint tenancy remains.

But that can't be right because the question states that the common law joint tenancy is unmodified by statute. So, perhaps the co-worker gets nothing, and the property is still held by the student and the boyfriend as joint tenants.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the boyfriend did convey his interest. So, perhaps the joint tenancy is severed, and the co-worker gets the boyfriend's interest as a tenant in common with the student.

Wait, but if the deed is void because of the forgery, then the co-worker didn't actually get any interest. So, the student and the boyfriend remain joint tenants.

But that's conflicting. Let me try to recall the rules.

In joint tenancy, if one joint tenant sells their interest, the buyer steps into their place, breaking the joint tenancy. But if the seller forges the other joint tenant's signature, does that make the entire deed invalid? Or does it just mean that the seller's interest is transferred, and the other remains.

I think the latter. Because a joint tenant can convey their own interest, which severs the joint tenancy. The fact that the other signature is forged doesn't affect the transfer of the seller's interest. But wait, the deed was supposed to convey the entire property. So, the co-worker thinks he bought the whole thing, but in reality, he's only getting the boyfriend's interest.

So, the co-worker would own half, and the student owns the other half as tenants in common. So, the answer would be G.

But wait, another angle: when a joint tenant conveys their interest, the joint tenancy is severed, and the grantee takes as a tenant in common. So, in this case, the co-worker receives the boyfriend's interest, and the student's interest remains. So, they become tenants in common.

So, the title is now held by the co-worker and the student as tenants in common. So, option G.

But let me check the options again.

Option G: the co-worker and the student as tenants in common. Yes, that matches.

Wait, but in the initial transfer, the boyfriend and the student were joint tenants. The boyfriend then conveys his interest (unbeknownst to the student) by a forged deed. So, the co-worker gets the boyfriend's interest, severing the joint tenancy. So, the co-worker and the student are tenants in common.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the answer should be G.

The scenario involves a college student and her boyfriend who purchased a parcel of land as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. The boyfriend, facing financial difficulties, forged the student's signature on a deed and sold the property to a co-worker for $150,000, which was the fair market value. The co-worker recorded the deed immediately. The question is about the current title to the property.

Under common law, joint tenancy requires the "four unities" (time, title, interest, and possession). When one joint tenant conveys their interest without the consent of the other, the joint tenancy is severed, and the grantee takes the interest as a tenant in common with the remaining joint tenant. Here, the boyfriend attempted to convey the entire property by forging the student's signature. However, a forged signature is invalid, so only the boyfriend's interest was effectively transferred. The student's interest remains intact.

The co-worker, as a bona fide purchaser (BFP) who paid full value and recorded the deed, might argue for protection under the BFP doctrine. However, the original joint tenancy was properly recorded, which could have put the co-worker on inquiry notice that both signatures were required to convey the entire property. Since the co-worker only received the boyfriend's interest, the joint tenancy is severed, and the co-worker and the student now hold the property as tenants in common.

Thus, the title to the property is now held by the co-worker and the student as tenants in common.
