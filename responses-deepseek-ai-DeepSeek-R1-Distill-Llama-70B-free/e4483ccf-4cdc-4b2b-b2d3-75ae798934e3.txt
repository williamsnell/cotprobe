Okay, so I've got this problem here about market prices and stock exchange ratios. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. 

So the question says that Company X's stock is priced at $45 per share, and Company Y's is $30. Now, X is offering three-fourths of a share of their common stock for each share of Y. I need to find the ratio of exchange of market prices. 

Wait, what's the ratio of exchange here? I think it's about how much one company's stock is valued relative to the other in this exchange. Like, if I'm a shareholder of Y, how much X stock would I get, and how does that compare in market value?

So each share of Y gets me 3/4 of X's share. So for every Y share, I get 0.75 X shares. But I need to find the ratio in terms of their market prices. Maybe I should calculate the market value of what I'm getting compared to what I'm giving up.

So the market price of X is $45 per share, and Y is $30. If I exchange one Y share, I get 0.75 X shares. So the value of what I receive is 0.75 times $45. Let me calculate that: 0.75 * 45 = 33.75. 

So for each Y share ($30), I get X shares worth $33.75. So the exchange ratio in terms of market prices would be Y's price divided by the value received from X. Or wait, is it the other way around? Hmm.

Wait, the question says the ratio of exchange of market prices. So maybe it's the price of X's share received divided by Y's price. Because for each Y share, you get 0.75 X shares. So the value you're getting per Y share is 0.75 * 45 = 33.75. So the ratio would be what multiple you're getting relative to Y's price.

Alternatively, thinking of it as a swap: Y's share is $30, and you get 0.75 shares of X, which are each $45. So the total value from X is 0.75*45 = 33.75. So the ratio is 33.75 / 30. Let's compute that: 33.75 /30 = 1.125. 

Wait, so that's 1.125 times. So the ratio is 1.125:1, meaning for each Y share, you get 1.125 times the value in X terms. But looking at the options, option C is 1.125. So is that the correct answer?

Wait another way: The exchange ratio is the number of X shares per Y share multiplied by the price of X, divided by the price of Y. So (0.75 * 45)/30. Let's compute that: 0.75*45=33.75, 33.75/30=1.125. Yep, same result. So the ratio is 1.125, which is option C.

I think that's correct. So the answer should be C.

The market price of Company X is $45 per share, and Company Y is $30 per share. Company X offers three-fourths (0.75) of a share of its common stock for each share of Company Y. To determine the ratio of exchange of market prices, we calculate the value of the X shares received for one Y share and compare it to the price of Y.

For one share of Y, the value of the X shares received is:

\[
0.75 \times 45 = 33.75
\]

The ratio of exchange is then the value of the X shares received divided by the price of one Y share:

\[
\frac{33.75}{30} = 1.125
\]

Thus, the ratio of exchange of market prices is **1.125**.
