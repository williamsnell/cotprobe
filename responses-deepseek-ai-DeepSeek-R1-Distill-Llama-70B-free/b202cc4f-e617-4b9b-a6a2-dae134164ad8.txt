Okay, I have this multiple-choice question about leadership theories, specifically contingency theory. I'm a bit rusty on my management theories, but let me think through this.

The question is asking who is a leading writer on contingency theory of leadership. The options are A through J, each a different theorist.

First, I remember that contingency theory suggests that there's no one best way to lead and that the effectiveness of a leadership style depends on the situation. So, the leader needs to adapt based on different factors like the task or the group.

Now, looking at the options. Let's go through them one by one to see who fits.

Option A: Abraham Maslow. He's known for the hierarchy of needs, which is a motivation theory, not directly related to contingency leadership. So probably not him.

Option B: Rensis Likert. I think he worked on management styles and leadership behaviors, maybe the linking pin theory or something about systems. Not sure if he's linked to contingency theory.

Option C: Henry Mintzberg. He's famous for his work on managerial roles and the nature of managerial work. Maybe not contingency theory.

Option D: Joan Woodward. She did research on organizational structure and technology, like the Woodward study on technical systems. Not contingency leadership.

Option E: John Adair. He's known for the action-centered leadership model, which is more about tasks, team, and individual. Not contingency.

Option F: Peter Drucker. He's a big name in management, known for concepts like management by objectives and the knowledge worker. Not specifically contingency theory.

Option G: Rosabeth Kanter. She wrote about change management and gender issues in the workplace. Not sure about contingency theory.

Option H: Warren Bennis. He's known for work on leadership, distinguishing between managers and leaders, and the competencies for leadership. Not contingency.

Option I: Fred Fiedler. Oh, wait, I think Fiedler is the one who developed the contingency model. His model suggested that leadership effectiveness depends on the leader's style and the situation. He proposed that task-oriented and people-oriented leaders are effective in different contexts. So, he's the contingency theory guy.

Option J: Douglas McGregor. He proposed Theory X and Theory Y, which are about management assumptions. Not contingency theory.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be I: Fred Fiedler.

The contingency theory of leadership posits that leadership effectiveness depends on the situation, requiring leaders to adapt their style based on factors like task and group dynamics. Among the listed theorists, Fred Fiedler is best known for developing the contingency model, which categorizes leaders as task-oriented or people-oriented and matches them to appropriate situational contexts. 

Answer: I
