Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about Mr. Hicky and the discounted note. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

Alright, so Mr. Hicky received a three-month note for $800 at 4% interest on April 17. Then, on May 17, his bank discounted the note at a 6% interest rate. I need to find his proceeds. 

Wait, I remember that when a bank discounts a note, they're essentially buying it from the holder before its maturity. The discount is based on the interest rate, so the proceeds would be the face value minus the discount. 

First, I think I need to calculate the discount the bank takes. The formula for discount is usually (face value) * (discount rate) * (time in years). But wait, time here is important. The note is three months old, but how much time is left until maturity? 

The note was received on April 17, and it's a three-month note. So it matures on July 17. Then, the bank discounts it on May 17. So from May 17 to July 17 is two months, right? Wait, no. Let's count the days. April has 30 days, so April 17 to April 30 is 13 days. Then May has 31 days, but since it's May 17, that's the end of May? Wait, no, the time from April 17 to May 17 is one month. So the note was issued April 17, and on May 17, two months have passed, leaving one month remaining. Because three months in total, so time remaining is two months minus? Wait, wait. No, wait: from April 17 to May 17 is one month, so the time remaining is two months (May 17 to July 17). Because April is the first month, May the second, and the note is for three months. Wait, no: if it's a three-month note starting April 17, it would mature on July 17. So from April 17 to May 17 is one month. So the remaining time when discounted is two months. But wait, wait, no. Because between May 17 and July 17 is exactly two months. So the time remaining is two months. 

But wait, how do we convert that into years for the discount calculation? Because interest rates are annual. So two months is 2/12 of a year, which is 1/6 or approximately 0.1667 years. 

The discount rate is 6%, so the discount amount would be 800 * 0.06 * (2/12). Let me calculate that. 

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Another approach is to calculate the present value of the note. Oh right, because discounting a note is about finding its present value. So the present value (PV) would be the face value divided by (1 + discount rate * time). Wait, no, that formula is for simple interest? Or is it for compound interest? Hmm, I think for discounting, when banks do it, they usually use simple interest. 

So the present value is face value minus the discount. Or, another way: PV = FV / (1 + (r * t)). But wait, when dealing with simple interest, the discount is I = P*r*t, and PV = FV - I. 

So let's compute the interest (discount) first. 

Face value (FV) = $800.

Time remaining (t) = from May 17 to July 17. That's two months. Which is 2/12 = 1/6 of a year, so approximately 0.1666667 years.

Discount rate (r) = 6% per annum, so 0.06.

So discount (I) = FV * r * t = 800 * 0.06 * (2/12). 

Wait, 2/12 is 1/6, so 800 * 0.06 = 48, then 48 * (1/6) = 8. So the discount is $8. 

Therefore, the proceeds would be FV - discount = 800 - 8 = $792. But wait, looking at the options, I don't see $792. Hmm, perhaps I did something wrong. Let me check the options again.

The options are A: $790.92, B: $798, C: $810, D: $799.92, E: $785.92, F: $795, G: $804.08, H: $792.50, I: $808, J: $800.

Hmm, option H is $792.50, which is close but not exactly what I got. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps the time is calculated in days, using exact days instead of months. Maybe the problem expects using the exact number of days between May 17 and July 17.

Wait, from May 17 to July 17: May has 31 days, so from May 17 to May 31 is 14 days. Then June has 30 days, and then up to July 17 is another 17 days. So total days: 14 + 30 +17 = 61 days.

Wait, but the note was dated April 17, and on May 17, so the time since the note was made is one month (30 days?), but perhaps the remaining time is 61 days. Alternatively, perhaps using 360-day years as is common in some financial calculations.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The note is for three months, which is 90 days (approx). If it's from April 17 to July 17, that's exactly 3 months. So from May 17 to July 17 is two months. But perhaps the bank uses a 360-day year for calculations. 

So, the time in years would be (number of days) / 360. Let's calculate the exact days.

From May 17 to July 17:

May: 31 days in May. So from May 17 to May 31 is 31-17 =14 days.

June: 30 days.

July 1 to July 17: 17 days.

Total: 14+30+17=61 days.

So time t = 61/360 years.

So discount I = 800 * 0.06 * (61/360).

Let me compute that: 800 * 0.06 = 48. Then 48 * (61/360).

61/360 is approximately 0.169444.

48 * 0.169444 ≈ let's compute 48 * 0.169444.

Well, 48 * 0.1 = 4.8, 48 * 0.06 = 2.88, 48 * 0.009444 ≈ 0.453. So total approx 4.8 + 2.88 = 7.68 + 0.453 = 8.133.

So discount is approximately $8.133. 

So proceeds = 800 - 8.133 = $791.867, which is about $791.87. Looking at the options, option A is $790.92, which is close but not exact.

Wait, maybe we should calculate it more accurately.

Let me compute 61/360 exactly. 61 divided by 360: 

61 ÷ 360 = 0.169444444...

So 48 * 0.169444444 = ?

48 * 0.1 = 4.8

48 * 0.06 = 2.88

48 * 0.0094444 = ?

0.0094444 is approximately 9.4444/1000.

So 48 * 9.4444 = 453.333, so 453.333 divided by 1000 is 0.453333.

So adding: 4.8 + 2.88 = 7.68 + 0.453333 = 8.133333.

So I = $8.133333.

Proceeds = 800 - 8.133333 = 791.866667.

Which is approximately $791.87.

Looking at the options, none match exactly, but the closest might be option A: $790.92 or option D: $799.92.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the time period. Maybe the time is only one month, not two? Let me think again. The note is three months, received April 17, so it's due July 17. When the bank discounts it on May 17, the time remaining is two months, as I thought before. So two months is 61 days. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that each month is 30 days, so 2 months is 60 days. So t = 60/360 = 1/6 ≈ 0.1666667.

So I = 800 * 0.06 * (60/360) = 800 * 0.06 * (1/6) = 800 * 0.01 = $8.

Proceeds would be $800 - $8 = $792. So that's $792.

Looking at the options, option H is $792.50, which is very close. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the interest on the note is being considered. The note has 4% interest, but the discount is at 6%. So maybe the present value calculation should include the interest earned so far.

Wait, no, because when the bank discounts the note, they're looking at the remaining period. So perhaps the note's interest isn't involved in the discounting calculation. The discount is based solely on the bank's rate (6%) for the remaining time. So maybe my initial approach was correct.

But then why is the option H $792.50? That's $0.50 more than $792. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the time is 59 days instead of 61, but that's getting into more detailed calculations. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for present value.

Alternatively, perhaps the discount is calculated as (face value) * (rate) * time. But another approach is to compute the present value as face value divided by (1 + rt). Wait, but that's for compound interest, and I think banks use simple interest for discounting.

Wait, let me try that. If using simple interest, the present value (PV) is FV / (1 + rt). So:

PV = 800 / (1 + 0.06*(61/360)).

Compute denominator: 1 + (0.06 * 61/360) = 1 + (3.66/360) = 1 + 0.010166667 = 1.010166667.

So PV = 800 / 1.010166667 ≈ let's compute that.

800 ÷ 1.010166667.

Hmm, let's compute 800 ÷ 1.010166667.

Well, 1.010166667 is approximately 1.0101667.

So 800 ÷ 1.0101667 ≈ 800 * (1/1.0101667).

1/1.0101667 is approximately 0.99008.

So 800 * 0.99008 = 792.064.

So approximately $792.06, which is close to $792.06. So the proceeds would be about $792.06, which rounds to $792.06. But again, the options don't have that. The closest is H: $792.50.

Wait, perhaps the time is being calculated as 60 days instead of 61. Let me try that.

t = 60/360 = 0.1666667.

So discount = 800 * 0.06 * 0.1666667 = 800 * 0.01 = $8.

Proceeds = 800 - 8 = $792.

Alternatively, using the present value formula: 800 / (1 + 0.06*(60/360)) = 800 / (1 + 0.01) = 800 / 1.01 ≈ 792.0392.

So approximately $792.04. Hmm, but that's still not matching any of the options exactly. So perhaps the problem is using a different approach. Wait, maybe the interest on the note itself is being considered. 

Wait, the note has an interest rate of 4%, but the bank is discounting at 6%. So perhaps the proceeds are calculated differently. Let me think: when a note is discounted, the bank pays the present value, which is face value minus the discount. The discount is calculated on the face value, using the discount rate and the remaining time.

I think my initial approach is correct. So perhaps the answer should be approximately $792, but the options don't have that. Wait, looking at the options again, option H is $792.50, which is 50 cents higher. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of time.

Wait, perhaps the time is being calculated as 60 days, and using more precise decimal places. Let me compute it again more accurately.

t = 60 days = 60/360 = 1/6 = 0.166666667.

Discount rate r = 6% = 0.06.

So discount = 800 * 0.06 * (60/360) = 800 * 0.06 * (1/6) = 800 * 0.01 = $8.

Proceeds = 800 - 8 = $792.

But that's exactly $792, which isn't an option. The closest option is H: $792.50.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the time from April 17 to May 17 as 30 days, making the remaining period 60 days, but perhaps including the end date. Wait, May 17 to July 17 is exactly two months, which could be 60 days if each month is considered 30 days. So perhaps that's the assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using 360 days per year, which is standard in some financial calculations. So 2 months is 60 days, which is 60/360 = 1/6 of a year.

So, proceeding again with that:

discount = 800 * 0.06 * (60/360) = 8.

Proceeds: 800 -8=792. So $792. But no option has that. 

Wait, perhaps the initial interest on the note affects it. The note itself has 4% interest. So perhaps the interest accrued from April 17 to May 17 (the first month) is being considered. 

Wait, what's the interest on the note? At 4% for three months. So the note's interest for one month is 800 * (4% / 3). Hmm, but I'm not sure how that would factor into the discounting. Because the bank is discounting the note based on their rate, not the note's rate. So perhaps that's a red herring.

Alternatively, perhaps the proceeds are calculated as the face value minus the discount, where the discount is based on the bank's rate for the remaining period. So that brings us back to the same calculation.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look at the options again. The options are:

A: $790.92

B: $798

C: $810

D: $799.92

E: $785.92

F: $795

G: $804.08

H: $792.50

I: $808

J: $800

In my calculations, I got approximately $792.06 when using exact days. But the option H is $792.50. Alternatively, perhaps the discount is being calculated with more precise time, like 60 days exactly, and perhaps using a different method.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the discount is calculated as (face value) * (bank's discount rate) * (time in years), and the proceeds are face value minus discount.

So, time in years is 60 days, which is 60/360 = 1/6 ≈ 0.1666667.

So discount = 800 * 0.06 * (1/6) = 800 * 0.01 = $8.

Proceeds = 800 -8=792. So again, $792.

Hmm, none of the options match exactly, but option H is $792.50, which is 50 cents more. Maybe the problem is using a different method, like adding the interest accrued on the note up to May 17.

Wait, the note was received on April 17, and on May 17, it's been a month. So the interest accrued on the note at 4% for one month would be 800 * (4% / 12) * 1 month.

Wait, that would be 800 * 0.0044444 ≈ $3.5555.

So the note's value on May 17 would be face value plus accrued interest: 800 + 3.5555 ≈ 803.5555.

But then, when the bank discounts it, they're discounting the note's present value, which includes the accrued interest. Wait, but no, because the note's maturity value is $800. The interest is included in the face value. Wait, no— the face value is $800, and the interest is 4% over three months. So the total amount due at maturity is 800 + (800 * 0.04 * 3/12) ?

Wait, no. Wait, the note is a three-month note at 4% interest. So the interest is 800 * 0.04 * (3/12) = 800 * 0.04 * 0.25 = 800 * 0.01 = $8. So the total due at maturity is 808.

So when Mr. Hicky discounts the note on May 17, the remaining time is two months. So the present value of the note would be the maturity value ($808) discounted at 6% for two months (or 1/6 of a year).

So present value = 808 / (1 + 0.06*(2/12)).

Wait, 2/12 is 1/6, so the denominator is 1.01.

So PV = 808 / 1.01 = approximately 800.

Wait, 1.01 * 800 = 808, so 808 /1.01=800. So the present value is 800.

Wait, that's interesting. So if the note's maturity value is $808, and it's discounted at 6% for the remaining two months, the present value is $800. So Mr. Hicky would receive $800.

But looking at the options, option J is $800. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought the proceeds were $792. So where did I go wrong before? Oh, I think I see now. I didn't account for the interest that's already accrued on the note.

So the note's face value is $800, but the interest is 4% over three months, which
