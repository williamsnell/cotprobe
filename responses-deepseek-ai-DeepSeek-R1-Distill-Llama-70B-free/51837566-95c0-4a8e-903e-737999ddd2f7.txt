Okay, so I have this problem here about transfer functions and two-port networks. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The question gives me a transfer function H(ω) which is the magnitude |H(ω₀)| multiplied by exp(-jφ), and ω is the same as ω₀. Wait, I think that's a typo in the question, maybe H(ω) is given as |H(ω₀)| exp(-jφ). 

The input is v_i which is cos(ω₀ t). I need to find the output as a function of time. So I remember that the transfer function relates the output to the input in the frequency domain. The output voltage should be the transfer function multiplied by the input voltage. 

Wait, the input is a cosine function. In phasor form, cosine can be written using Euler's formula. So cos(ω₀ t) is the real part of exp(jω₀ t). So the phasor representation of the input is 1 at frequency ω₀, I think. 

So the output phasor would be H(ω₀) multiplied by the input phasor. Since H(ω₀) is |H| exp(-jφ), the output phasor is |H| exp(-jφ) multiplied by 1 (since input is 1 in phasor). So the output phasor is |H| exp(-jφ).

To get back to the time domain, I take the real part of the output phasor multiplied by exp(jω₀ t). So that would be the real part of |H| exp(-jφ) exp(jω₀ t). Using Euler's formula, exp(jω₀ t - jφ) is cos(ω₀ t - φ) + j sin(ω₀ t - φ). Taking the real part gives |H| cos(ω₀ t - φ).

Wait, but looking at the options, let me see. Option D says |H| cos(ω₀ t - φ), which matches what I have. Option B and E are using the magnitude times cosine, but with phase or without. Option D seems right.

Wait, another approach. The output in time domain is the transfer function's magnitude times the input function, with a phase shift. So input is cos(ω t), output is |H| cos(ω t - φ). Yeah, that makes sense.

So the correct answer should be option D.

To solve the problem, we start with the given transfer function of the two-port network:

\[
H(\omega) = |H(\omega_0)| e^{-j\phi}.
\]

The input voltage is \( v_i = \cos(\omega_0 t) \). To find the output voltage, we use the fact that the transfer function relates the output to the input in the frequency domain. The phasor representation of the input is \( 1 \) at frequency \( \omega_0 \), so the output phasor is:

\[
V_{\text{out}}(\omega_0) = H(\omega_0) \cdot V_{\text{in}}(\omega_0) = |H(\omega_0)| e^{-j\phi} \cdot 1 = |H(\omega_0)| e^{-j\phi}.
\]

To convert this back to the time domain, we take the real part of the output phasor multiplied by \( e^{j\omega_0 t} \):

\[
v_{\text{out}}(t) = \text{Re} \left[ |H(\omega_0)| e^{-j\phi} e^{j\omega_0 t} \right].
\]

Using Euler's formula, \( e^{j\omega_0 t - j\phi} = \cos(\omega_0 t - \phi) + j\sin(\omega_0 t - \phi) \), and taking the real part gives:

\[
v_{\text{out}}(t) = |H(\omega_0)| \cos(\omega_0 t - \phi).
\]

This matches option D. The other options are incorrect because they either do not include the correct phase shift or use the wrong trigonometric function.

**Answer: D**
