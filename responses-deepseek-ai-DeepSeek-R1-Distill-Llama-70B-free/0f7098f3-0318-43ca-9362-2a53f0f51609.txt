Okay, so I have this psychology question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's read it again to make sure I understand.

The question says: Bu is often late for appointments but says it's because she had more important things on her mind. This is an example of which coping strategy? The options are A through I, each a different psychological term.

Hmm, I remember that coping strategies are the ways people deal with stress, right? So Bu is late and she's making an excuse about more important things. I'm thinking about what defense mechanisms or coping strategies involve making excuses or justifying behavior.

The first term that comes to mind is denial. Denial is when someone refuses to accept reality or facts. Like if someone is sick and they keep saying they're fine, that's denial. But wait, Bu isn't denying that she's late; she's giving a reason. So maybe it's not denial.

Another option is projection. Projection is when you attribute your own negative traits to someone else. Like if you're mad at someone but say they're mad at you. But Bu isn't shifting her fault onto someone else here. She's justifying her lateness by her reasons, so maybe not projection.

Displacement is redirecting emotions to a different target. Like if you're mad at your boss and yell at your kid. Doesn't seem to fit here because she's not redirecting emotions; she's explaining her lateness.

Repression is pushing uncomfortable thoughts or feelings into the unconscious. But Bu is expressing her thoughts, not hiding them, so that's probably not it.

Sublimation is channeling unacceptable impulses into more acceptable behaviors. Like turning aggression into sports. Doesn't fit this scenario.

Avoidance is staying away from situations that cause stress. If Bu were avoiding appointments, maybe, but she's attending them late, not avoiding them.

Regression is reverting to an earlier stage of development, like a child acting baby-like when stressed. Doesn't seem related here.

Immunization, I'm not too sure about. I think it's a term sometimes used in the context of building up resistance, maybe to stress, but I'm not certain how it applies here.

Assimilation is incorporating new information into existing schemas, like learning. Not directly related to coping with stress or emotions.

Accommodation is changing one's behavior or thinking to fit new information. Also part of learning, I think, not a defense mechanism.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up some concepts. Let me think again. The question is about Bu's behavior. She's late but justifies it by saying she had more important things. So she's rationalizing her behavior. Rationalization is a defense mechanism where someone gives a logical excuse to justify behavior that might otherwise be unacceptable.

But looking at the options given, I don't see rationalization as an option. The choices are A: Projection, B: Regression, C: Immunization, D: Assimilation, E: Avoidance, F: Displacement, G: Denial, H: Accommodation, I: Sublimation.

Hmm, so none of these are rationalization. So I must have made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe it's denial. Because she's denying that she's late because of her own disorganization and instead blaming it on having more important things. So she's not accepting her own responsibility for being late. So that could be denial.

Alternatively, she might be using projection if she's saying others are making her late, but in this case, she's saying she had more important things. So it's more about her own priorities rather than blaming others.

So if she's saying she had more important things, she's justifying her lateness. That sounds like denial of her responsibility. So the answer would be G: Denial.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes people use "denial" when they refuse to acknowledge something. But in this case, Bu is acknowledging she's late, but giving a reason. So maybe it's not denial.

Alternatively, it's a form of intellectualization, where she's explaining her behavior with a logical excuse. But that's not one of the options either.

Wait, going back to the options, another option is E: Avoidance. But she's not avoiding the appointment; she's just late. So that's probably not it.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me think about each option again.

Projection: Attributing her own faults to others. Not the case here.

Regression: Acting like a child. Not relevant.

Displacement: Redirecting emotions. Not applicable.

Sublimation: Channeling impulses. Not this.

Avoidance: Not attending. She's attending, just late.

Denial: Refusing to accept reality. If she's late but says she's not, that's denial. But she's not denying being late; she's explaining why.

Wait, perhaps it's not denial. Maybe it's something else. Let me thinkâ€”could it be rationalization? But that's not an option.

Oh wait, the options given include "G: Denial." Maybe the question is considering her denial of the consequences of her lateness. Or perhaps she's denying that her lateness is a problem by justifying it.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is not G, but something else. Let me think of other defense mechanisms.

Wait, another possibility is that she's using "rationalization," but since that's not an option, perhaps the closest is denial.

Alternatively, maybe it's a form of "avoidance" in the sense that she's avoiding responsibility for her lateness.

Wait, no. Avoidance is more about evading the situation, not about making excuses.

So perhaps the correct answer is G: Denial. Because she's denying that her lateness is due to her own failure to manage time, and instead, she's attributing it to more important things. So she's refusing to accept her own responsibility, which is a form of denial.

Yes, I think that's the right approach. So the answer should be G: Denial.
</think>

Bu is often late for appointments but justifies it by saying she had more important things on her mind. This behavior involves refusing to accept responsibility for her lateness and instead attributing it to her priorities. Among the given options, the closest match is "denial," as she is denying her own failure to manage time and the consequences of her lateness. While rationalization might seem applicable, it is not listed as an option. Therefore, the best fit is:

G: Denial.

Answer: G
