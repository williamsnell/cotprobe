Okay, so I've got this problem here about dry ice in a wine bottle. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Alright, let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that a 20 g chunk of dry ice (which is CO2) is placed in a 0.75-liter wine bottle and then corked tightly. I need to find the final pressure after all the CO2 has evaporated and the temperature is 25°C. The options are from A to J, so I have to calculate and pick the correct one.

Hmm, right. So dry ice is solid carbon dioxide. When it's placed in the bottle, it's going to sublime, meaning it turns directly into gas. Since the bottle is sealed, the CO2 gas will build up pressure inside.

First, I think I should find out how many moles of CO2 are in 20 grams. Because once I know the moles, I can use the ideal gas law to find the pressure. Oh wait, the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. Yeah, that's right.

So, the molar mass of CO2. Carbon is about 12 g/mol, and oxygen is 16 g/mol each. So CO2 is 12 + (16 * 2) = 44 g/mol. Got it. So 20 grams divided by 44 g/mol gives the moles.

Let me calculate that. 20 / 44 is approximately 0.4545 moles. Wait, let me double-check that division. 44 times 0.45 is 19.8, so yeah, 0.4545 is about right.

Next, the volume of the bottle is 0.75 liters. But wait, the gas constant R is usually in terms of liters and atmospheres, right? So R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K. But I should make sure about the units.

Temperature is given as 25°C. Oh, I need to convert that to Kelvin. Kelvin is Celsius plus 273.15. So 25 + 273.15 is 298.15 K. Approximately 298 K.

Now, plug all into the ideal gas law. P = nRT / V.

So n is 0.4545 mol, R is 0.0821, T is 298 K, and V is 0.75 L.

Calculating that:

nRT = 0.4545 * 0.0821 * 298.

Let me compute that step by step. 0.4545 multiplied by 0.0821 is approximately... Let me see, 0.45 * 0.08 is 0.036, but a bit more precise. 0.4545 * 0.0821 = ?

Well, 0.4545 * 80 is 36.36, but wait, that's 0.0821 (which is about 8.21 x 10^-2). Let me compute 0.4545 * 0.0821.

0.4545 * 0.08 is 0.03636, and 0.4545 * 0.0021 is about 0.000954. So total is approximately 0.03636 + 0.000954 ≈ 0.037314.

Wait, but that's 0.4545 * 0.0821 = approximately 0.0373. Then multiply by 298 K.

So 0.0373 * 298. Let's see, 0.0373 * 300 is 11.19, but since it's 298, subtract 0.0373 * 2, which is 0.0746. So 11.19 - 0.0746 = 11.1154.

So nRT is approximately 11.1154. Now, divide by V, which is 0.75 L.

11.1154 / 0.75 = let's see, 11.1154 divided by 0.75. 0.75 times 14 is 10.5. 11.1154 minus 10.5 is 0.6154, so 0.6154 / 0.75 is about 0.82. So total is 14.82 atm approximately.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculations because sometimes approximations can cause errors.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise numbers for better accuracy.

Let me recompute n: 20g / 44.01 g/mol = approximately 0.4545 mol.

R is 0.082057 L·atm/mol·K. Let's use that exact value.

T is 298.15 K.

So nRT = 0.4545 * 0.082057 * 298.15.

Compute 0.4545 * 0.082057 first.

0.4545 * 0.082057: Let's calculate this.

0.4 * 0.082057 = 0.0328228.

0.0545 * 0.082057: 0.05 * 0.082057 is 0.00410285, 0.0045 * 0.082057 is approx 0.00036926. So adding 0.00410285 + 0.00036926 = 0.00447211.

So total 0.0328228 + 0.00447211 = 0.03729491.

Then multiply by 298.15 K.

0.03729491 * 298.15 ≈ ?

Well, 0.03729491 * 300 = 11.1884, but subtract 0.03729491 * 1.85 (since 300 -298.15=1.85).

0.03729491 * 1.85 = approximately 0.0373 * 1.85.

0.0373 * 1 = 0.0373.

0.0373 * 0.85 = 0.0317 (approx 0.0317555).

So total 0.0373 + 0.0317555 = 0.0690555.

So 11.1884 - 0.0690555 ≈ 11.1193.

So nRT ≈ 11.1193 L·atm.

Now divide by V=0.75 L: 11.1193 / 0.75 = let's see.

0.75 * 14 = 10.5.

11.1193 -10.5 = 0.6193.

0.6193 /0.75 = 0.826.

So 14.826 atm.

Looking at the options, option A is 14.81 atm, D is 16.81, etc.

Wait but my calculation gives around 14.83 atm, which would match option A (14.81). But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the initial moles.

Wait 20g CO2. Molar mass is 44.01 g/mol, so 20 /44.01 = 0.4545 mol. That part is correct.

Another thought: does the volume include the space taken by the dry ice before it sublimates? Hmm, the problem says the bottle is "empty" except for the dry ice. So the volume is 0.75 L, and the dry ice is solid so it doesn't take up significant volume in the gas phase until it sublimes. So the volume available for the gas is 0.75 L. So that part is correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. The bottle may have air in it initially, but the question says it's "empty". Oh, but in reality, an empty bottle would have air, but perhaps the question is considering that the bottle is evacuated, or perhaps it's just that the CO2 is the only gas. Wait, the problem states the bottle is "empty" and then the dry ice is placed and corked. So perhaps the initial pressure is just atmospheric, but when the CO2 sublimes, the pressure would increase.

Wait, but the question says "after all the CO2 has evaporated and the temperature has reached 25°C". So the initial air in the bottle is probably negligible, or perhaps the question assumes that the bottle is completely empty, meaning a vacuum, except for the CO2. But that seems unlikely. Hmm, that might be a point I'm missing.

If the bottle initially contains air at atmospheric pressure, then when the dry ice sublimes, the pressure would be the sum of the air pressure and the CO2 pressure. But the problem doesn't clarify this. Hmm, tricky.

Wait, the problem states it's an "empty" 0.75 L wine bottle. So perhaps it's a vacuum. But that's not realistic because when you put dry ice in a bottle and cork it, the initial pressure would be atmospheric. Or maybe the initial pressure is atmospheric. So when the dry ice sublimes, the pressure increases due to the CO2.

Wait, let me think again. The problem says the bottle is "empty"—so perhaps it's vacuum. So initial pressure is zero, and then the CO2 sublimes, adding its pressure. But that might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the bottle is filled with air at 1 atm, and then CO2 is added. Hmm, but if the bottle is tightly corked, the initial air would contribute to the final pressure.

Wait, the problem doesn't specify whether the bottle is evacuated or not. So perhaps the proper approach is to assume that the bottle is empty except for the dry ice, implying that initially, there's a vacuum, and the only gas present is the sublimated CO2.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's see. If the bottle is empty and then corked, perhaps the initial pressure is atmospheric. So when you put it in the bottle, but then the CO2 sublimes, the pressure increases. So the total pressure would be the sum of the initial pressure (if any) plus the pressure from CO2.

Wait, but let me read the problem again. It says the bottle is "empty" and tightly corked. So perhaps the initial pressure is 1 atm, but when the CO2 sublimes, it's adding to that pressure. But that seems unlikely because if the bottle is empty, perhaps it's under vacuum. Hmm. Oh wait, no, an empty bottle that's corked would have whatever pressure it had before corking. But if it's simply placed in an empty bottle, the initial pressure inside when you cork it would be atmospheric pressure, because the bottle was open before corking.

Wait, perhaps the initial pressure inside the bottle is 1 atm. Then when the CO2 sublimes, it adds to that pressure. So the total pressure would be 1 atm plus the pressure from the CO2.

But wait, in that case, the calculation would change. Because the CO2's pressure would be on top of the initial 1 atm.

Wait, but the problem says "after all the CO2 has evaporated", so it's only CO2 in the bottle? Or is the initial air present as well?

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think again. The problem says the bottle is "empty", and then the dry ice is placed and tightly corked. So when you put dry ice into an empty bottle and cork it, the initial pressure is whatever is inside. If the bottle was empty, but open, then initial pressure is atmospheric. But when you cork it, the CO2 sublimes, so the pressure increases.

Wait no, the bottle is empty, so when you put the dry ice in, and cork it, the only gas that forms is from the CO2. So perhaps the initial pressure is 1 atm, but that's just the ambient pressure before corking. Once corked, the CO2 sublimes, adding to the pressure.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider only the CO2 contributing to the pressure. Because if the bottle was empty except for the CO2, then all the gas present is CO2. But maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, in the ideal gas calculation, we're assuming that the only gas present is CO2. Because when CO2 sublimes, it's the only gas in the bottle, as the bottle was empty. So perhaps the initial pressure is zero, or maybe 1 atm, but then when CO2 is added, it's the dominant pressure.

Wait, the problem says "after all the CO2 has evaporated", which suggests that only CO2 is present. So perhaps the initial air doesn't contribute because the bottle was evacuated, but that's not stated.

Alternatively, perhaps the bottle is open to the atmosphere until it's corked. So when you put the dry ice in and cork it, the initial pressure is 1 atm, and then as the CO2 sublimes, the pressure increases.

Wait, but in that case, the total pressure would be 1 atm plus the pressure from the CO2. But that complicates things, and none of the options seem to reflect that. Because if the CO2 alone gives 14.8 atm, adding 1 atm would make it 15.8, which is option H (15.81 atm). But let me see the options again.

Options:

A: 14.81 atm

H:15.81 atm

So that's a consideration.

Hmm, but I'm a bit confused. The problem states that the bottle is "empty"—so perhaps it's under vacuum. So initial pressure is zero, and the final pressure is just from the CO2.

In that case, the calculation I did earlier, getting around 14.8 atm, which matches option A.

But another approach is that the bottle was at 1 atm before corking, and the CO2 adds to that, making the final pressure 1 atm + 14.8 atm = ~15.8 atm, which is option H.

Wait, but the problem says the bottle is "empty". So perhaps it's a vacuum, initial pressure is zero, and the final pressure is due solely to the CO2. So the correct answer would be A:14.81 atm.

Alternatively, maybe the bottle had air at 1 atm, and the CO2 adds to that. So the total pressure would be higher.

But how do I decide which assumption is correct?

Well, in chemistry problems, when a container is said to be "empty", it's often assumed that it's under vacuum, or perhaps that any initial gas (like air) is negligible. Alternatively, the question may not consider the initial air because it's focused on the CO2.

Wait, but let me think: when you place dry ice in a bottle and cork it, the initial pressure is atmospheric. The ice starts sublimating, but as it does, the pressure increases, and the temperature drops. But in this problem, the temperature is given as 25°C, which is higher than the sublimation temperature of CO2, so all the CO2 would have sublimated.

Wait, but the problem is in an exam setting, so perhaps the intended approach is to assume that the bottle is evacuated, and only CO2 contributes to the pressure. So the calculation I did earlier of ~14.8 atm would be correct, making option A the answer.

But wait, another thing to consider: the units for pressure in the ideal gas law. Let me make sure.

Yes, R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K, so the calculation gives pressure in atm, which matches the options.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again because 20g is 0.4545 mol, R is 0.0821, T is 298.15, V is 0.75.

So P = (0.4545 * 0.0821 * 298.15) / 0.75.

Let me compute this more accurately.

n = 20 /44.01 = 0.4545 mol.

R = 0.082057 L·atm/mol·K.

T = 298.15 K.

Compute numerator: 0.4545 * 0.082057 = let's compute.

0.4545 * 0.082057.

Breaking it down:

0.4 * 0.082057 = 0.0328228

0.05 * 0.082057 = 0.00410285

0.0045 * 0.082057 = 0.0003692565

Adding them together: 0.0328228 + 0.00410285 = 0.03692565 + 0.0003692565 ≈ 0.0372949.

Now multiply by T =298.15:

0.0372949 * 298.15.

Let me compute 0.0372949 * 300 = 11.18847.

But since it's 298.15, which is 300 - 1.85.

So subtract 0.0372949 * 1.85.

0.0372949 * 1 = 0.0372949.

0.0372949 * 0.85 = 0.031680165.

Total subtraction: 0.0372949 + 0.031680165 = 0.068975065.

So 11.18847 - 0.068975065 ≈ 11.119495.

Now divide by V =0.75 L:

11.119495 / 0.75 ≈ 14.826 atm.

So approximately 14.826 atm. Looking at the options, the closest is option A:14.81 atm. So the answer is A.

But wait, another point: did I account for the fact that CO2 might not behave ideally at high pressures? Well, the problem doesn't mention that, so we have to proceed with the ideal gas law.

So I think the correct answer is A:14.81 atm.
</think>

To determine the final pressure in the bottle after all the CO₂ has evaporated and the temperature has reached 25°C, we use the ideal gas law:

\[
PV = nRT
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the number of moles of CO₂
The molar mass of CO₂ is calculated as:

\[
\text{Molar mass of CO}_2 = 12.01 + (16.00 \times 2) = 44.01 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

Given the mass of CO₂ is 20 g, the number of moles is:

\[
n = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{molar mass}} = \frac{20}{44.01} \approx 0.4545 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 2: Convert temperature to Kelvin
The temperature is given as 25°C. Converting to Kelvin:

\[
T = 25 + 273.15 = 298.15 \, \text{K}
\]

### Step 3: Use the ideal gas law
The ideal gas constant \( R \) is \( 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \), and the volume \( V \) is \( 0.75 \, \text{L} \). Substituting into the ideal gas law:

\
