Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on my physics, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: A baseball pitcher throws a ball weighing 1/3 pound with an acceleration of 480 feet per second squared. How much force does he apply to the ball? The options are from A to J.

Hmm, I remember from my classes that force is related to mass and acceleration. Oh right, Newton's second law! The basic formula is F equals m times a. But wait, the tricky part here might be the units because the mass is given in pounds and the acceleration is in feet per second squared. I think in the English system, we often use pounds for weight, but force is measured in pounds-force, and mass is in slugs. Oh wait, but sometimes people get confused between mass and weight.

So the ball's weight is 1/3 pound. Wait, weight is a force, right? So weight equals mass times gravity. So if weight is 1/3 lb, then mass m = weight / g. What's g in feet per second squared? I remember that g is approximately 32 ft/s².

Let me write that down. Mass m = weight / g. So m = (1/3 lb) / 32 ft/s². Wait, but that would give me something in lb·s² / ft, which I think is a slug. Because 1 slug is 1 lb·s²/ft. Yeah, because F = m a, so m = F/a, and if F is in lb, then m would be in lb·s²/ft, which is slugs.

So m = (1/3) / 32 = 1/(96) slugs.

Wait, let me double-check that. Because weight W = m * g. So m = W / g. So W is 1/3 lb, g is 32 ft/s², so m is (1/3) / 32 = 1/(96) slugs.

Then, the force applied is F = m * a. The acceleration a is 480 ft/s².

So F = (1/96) slugs * 480 ft/s².

Let me compute that. 480 divided by 96 is 5. Because 96 *5 = 480.

So F = 5 lb. Because the units would be (slug * ft/s²) = (lb·s²/ft * ft/s²) )= lb.

Wait, so that would make the force 5 pounds-force. So looking at the options, option G is 5 lbs. of force.

But wait, let me think again. Did I get the mass correctly? Because sometimes I mix up mass and weight. So weight is 1/3 lb, which is a force. Mass is m = weight / g. So m is (1/3)/32 slugs. Then F = ma is (1/96)*480, which is 5 lb.

Alternatively, if I thought the mass was already given as 1/3 lb, then F would be (1/3)*480 = 160 lb, which is option J. But that can't be right because pounds is a unit of force, not mass.

Wait, so the confusion is between mass in pounds (which is incorrect) and pounds as weight. So since weight is given, we have to convert that to mass in slugs before applying F=ma. So the correct approach is to compute mass as weight divided by g, then multiply by acceleration.

So yes, I think option G is correct.

To determine the force applied by the baseball pitcher, we use Newton's second law: **F = m \cdot a**. However, care must be taken with the units. The weight of the ball is given as **1/3 pound**, which is a force, not mass. To find the mass \(m\), we use the relationship \(m = \frac{\text{weight}}{g}\), where \(g = 32 \, \text{ft/s}^2\). 

1. Calculate the mass:  
   \[
   m = \frac{\frac{1}{3} \, \text{lb}}{32 \, \text{ft/s}^2} = \frac{1}{96} \, \text{slugs}.
   \]

2. Use \(F = m \cdot a\) to find the force:  
   \[
   F = \left(\frac{1}{96} \, \text{slugs}\right) \cdot \left(480 \, \text{ft/s}^2\right) = 5 \, \text{lbs}.
   \]

Thus, the pitcher applies **5 lbs. of force** to the ball. The correct answer is **G**.
