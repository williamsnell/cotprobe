Okay, so I've got this problem about a three-phase stator armature, and I need to calculate a few things. Hmm, let's take it step by step.

First, the problem says it's a 72-slot stator wound for six poles. It uses double-layer lap coils with 20 turns per coil and a 5/6 pitch. The flux per pole is 4.8e6 lines, and the rotor speed is 1200 rpm. I need to find five things: (a) the generated effective voltage per coil of a full-pitch coil, (b) the total number of turns per phase, (c) the distribution factor, (d) the pitch factor, and (e) the total generated voltage per phase using those factors and a given equation.

Alright, let's start with part (a): generated effective voltage per coil. For a full-pitch coil, the induced voltage is given by E = φNf/p, where φ is the flux per pole, N is the number of turns per coil, f is the frequency, and p is the number of poles.

Wait, but what's the frequency here? The rotor speed is 1200 rpm. For a six-pole machine, the synchronous speed is n_sync = (120f)/p, so f = (n_sync * p) / 120. Wait, no, n_sync is 1200 rpm, which is the rotor speed. So f = (n_sync * p) / (120 * 2) because for a three-phase machine, the frequency is related to the number of poles. Wait, no, wait—synchronous speed is n = 120f/p. So f = n * p / 120. Right.

So f = (1200 rpm * 6 poles) / 120 = 1200 *6 /120 = 60 Hz. Okay, so the frequency is 60 Hz.

Now, each coil has 20 turns. So for a full-pitch coil, the induced voltage Ecoil is φ * N * f / p. Wait, but wait, the formula for induced voltage in a coil is E = (φ * N * f) / a, where a is the number of parallel paths. Wait, but for a double-layer lap winding, the number of parallel paths a is equal to the number of poles. Hmm, right, for lap windings, a = p. So with p=6, a=6.

Wait, but in part (a), it's about a full-pitch coil. So let me think again. Wait, the problem says these are lap coils with a 5/6 pitch. Oh, but part (a) is about a full-pitch coil, not the actual 5/6 pitch. So in a full-pitch coil, the pitch is such that it spans all the poles, so the number of slots per pole per phase is q = 72/(3*6) = 72/18 = 4. So each phase has 4 slots per pole.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating things. Let's think: for a full-pitch coil, the number of turns per coil is N = 20, but the coil is full-pitch, so it covers all the poles. Hmm, maybe I should use the standard formula for induced voltage per coil.

Alternatively, the formula for voltage induced per coil is E = (φZf)/(p * a), where Z is the number of conductors per coil. Wait, but Z would be 2 * turns per coil, since each turn has two conductors. Oh wait, no, each turn is a loop, so each turn has two conductors. So for N turns, Z = 2*N. So E per coil would be (φ * Z * f) / (p * a) ?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up some formulas. Let me think again. The induced voltage in a single coil is E = (φ * N_c * f) / a, where N_c is the number of turns per coil, and a is the number of parallel paths. Since it's a lap winding, a = p, which is 6. So E = (4.8e6 * 20 * 60) / 6. Let me calculate that.

So 4.8e6 * 20 = 96e6. 96e6 *60 = 5.76e9. Divide by 6 gives 0.96e9, which is 960,000 volts. Wait, that can't be right. That's way too high. Oh wait, perhaps I'm missing some factor here. Oh wait, the formula might be different. Oh wait, maybe it's E = (φ * N_c * f) * (number of conductors per coil?) Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. The induced voltage per phase is E_p = (φ * Z * f * K_w) / a, where K_w is the winding factor, which for a full-pitch coil would be 1. But I'm trying to find the voltage per coil, not per phase.

Alternatively, for a full-pitch, single-layer winding, the voltage per coil would be (φ * N_c * f) / a. So using that, N_c is 20, φ is 4.8e6, f is 60, a=6.

So E = (4.8e6 * 20 * 60) / 6. Let's compute that. 4.8e6 *20 = 96e6. 96e6 *60 = 5.76e9. Divide by 6: 5.76e9 /6 = 0.96e9 V, which is 960,000 V. That's way too high, so I must be doing something wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula is E = (φ * N_c * f) / (a * p). No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the formula is E_coil = (φ * N_t * f * K_p) / a, where N_t is the number of turns per coil? Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, the problem says the stator is wound with double-layer lap coils. So for each slot, there are two coils (double-layer). Wait, no, double-layer means that each slot has two conductors from different coils. Hmm, but maybe that's complicating things. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the key here is that each phase has a certain number of coils, and each coil contributes some voltage. Alternatively, perhaps for a full-pitch coil, the voltage per coil is E = (φ * f * N_c) / a, with a being the number of parallel paths.

Wait, let's compute that again. φ is 4.8e6 Wb, N_c is 20, a=6.

So (4.8e6) *20 =96e6. 96e6 *60 =5.76e9. Divided by 6 gives 0.96e9 V, which is 960,000 V. That seems way too high because the options are around 200-300 V per coil. So I'm definitely missing something here.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in a lap winding, the number of parallel paths a is equal to the number of poles, so a=6. But the formula for induced voltage per coil could be E = (φ * N_c * f) / (a). So that would be (4.8e6 * 20 * 60) / 6.

Wait, 4.8e6 *20 = 96e6. 96e6 *60 =5.76e9. 5.76e9 /6=0.96e9 V. That's 960,000 V. That can't be right because the options are in the 250-310 range.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Let me think: the induced voltage in one turn is E_turn = φ * f / a. Then, for N_c turns, E_coil = E_turn * N_c.

So E_turn = (4.8e6 *60) /6 = 4.8e6 *10 = 48e6 V per turn. Then, per coil, which has 20 turns, E_coil =48e6 *20=96e6 *1e-6? Wait, perhaps units are confusing me.

Wait, 4.8e6 Wb is 4,800,000 Wb. So E_turn = (4.8e6 Wb) *60 Hz /6 paths = 4.8e6 *60 /6 = 4.8e6 *10 = 48,000,000 V per turn? That's 48 million volts per turn, which is impossible. Clearly, I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up Weber and volt-seconds. 1 Weber is 1 volt-second. So the flux is 4.8e6 Wb, which is 4.8e6 V-s per pole.

Wait, then the EMF induced in a single turn is E = dΦ/dt = 2πfΦ = 2π *60 *4.8e6. Wait, that would be EMF per turn. Let me compute that.

E_turn = 2π *60 *4.8e6 = 2 *3.1416 *60 *4.8e6. That would be a huge number, but that's per turn. Wait, but that can't be right because the options are much lower.

Wait, perhaps the formula I should use is E = (Φ * f * N) / (a), where a is the number of parallel paths. So for a full-pitch coil, a = p =6.

So Φ is 4.8e6, f=60, N=20, a=6.

E = (4.8e6 *60 *20) /6.

Calculate that: 4.8e6 *60 =288e6. 288e6 *20=5.76e9. Divided by6: 5.76e9 /6=0.96e9 V. Again 960,000 V per coil. That's way higher than any option given, so I must be doing this wrong.

Wait, maybe I'm not accounting for something else. Oh wait, perhaps the formula is E = (Φ * f * N_c * K_p) / a, where K_p is the pitch factor. But wait, in part (a), it's a full-pitch coil, so K_p would be 1. So that doesn't change anything. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the generated voltage per coil is calculated differently. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the number of coils per phase and the number of turns per phase. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, perhaps each phase has multiple coils, and each coil contributes some voltage. But maybe the voltage per coil is just the same as the voltage per turn multiplied by the number of turns. Wait, but earlier that gave a huge number.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the given flux per pole is 4.8e6 max value, but the RMS value is different. Oh! Wait, flux is given as 4.8e6 lines, but I think that's the maximum flux, so the RMS would be (flux_max)/√2.

Wait, but in electrical machines, the flux per pole is usually the RMS value. Or is it the peak? Hmm, this is a point I'm not certain about. Let me think: when they give flux per pole, is it the peak or RMS? I think it's usually the peak value. So if that's the case, then the RMS flux per pole would be (4.8e6)/√2 ≈ 3.394e6 Wb.

Wait, but if that's the case, then I can recalculate E_coil as (Φ_rms * N_c * f)/a.

So Φ_rms = 4.8e6 /√2 ≈ 3.394e6 Wb.

So E_coil = (3.394e6 *20 *60)/6.

Compute that: 3.394e6 *20 =6.788e7. Multiply by60: 6.788e7 *60=4.073e9. Divided by 6: ~678.83e6 V. That's still way too high. Hmm, something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe I should calculate the voltage per phase first and then find per coil.

Wait, the total number of slots is 72, 6 poles, so slots per pole is 72/6=12. Since it's a three-phase machine, slots per phase per pole is 12/3=4. So q=4.

Wait, the number of conductors per slot is 2 (because double-layer), so each slot has two conductors. The total number of conductors is 72 * 2 = 144. Since it's a three-phase machine, conductors per phase are 144/3=48. Each conductor has two turns, so turns per phase would be 48 * (20 / 2) ? Wait, no, each slot has 20 turns per coil, but wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps each slot has two conductors (double-layer), each conductor is part of a different coil. So each slot has two coils passing through it, each with 20 turns. No, wait, each slot has two layers, each layer being a turn of a coil.

Wait, maybe I should find the number of turns per phase first. That's part (b), but perhaps doing it now will help.

Number of turns per phase: For a lap winding, the number of turns per phase is (number of slots) * (turns per slot) / (a) where a is the number of parallel paths.

Wait, a is 6 (number of poles) for a lap winding. But each slot has two conductors (double-layer), so each slot contributes two turns per phase? Wait, perhaps the number of turns per phase is (number of slots per phase) * (turns per slot per phase).

Wait, the total slots are 72, so each phase has 72/3=24 slots. Each slot has two layers, so each slot contributes two conductors. Each conductor is part of a coil. So for each slot, each phase has two conductors, each with 20 turns, but I'm not sure.

Wait, double-layer lap winding: each slot has two coils, each with a certain number of turns. Wait, perhaps each slot has two conductors, each from a different phase. No, in a three-phase machine, each slot contains conductors from the same phase but different poles. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, in a double-layer winding, each slot has two conductors, each belonging to the same phase but different coils.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of total conductors. Each slot has two conductors (double-layer), so total conductors are 72 *2=144. Each phase has 144/3=48 conductors. Each conductor has N turns, but each coil has 20 turns. Wait, but each conductor is a single-turn, so N would be the number of turns per conductor, which is 20. So total turns per phase would be 48 *20=960 turns. But that's a lot, and the options don't have such a high number.

Wait, perhaps each coil has 20 turns, and each phase has a certain number of coils. The number of coils per phase would be (number of slots per phase) * (number of layers) / number of poles? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: the number of conductors per phase is (total slots * 2) /3 = (72 *2)/3=48. Each conductor is part of a coil with N=20 turns. So the total number of turns per phase is 48 *20=960. But the options are all around 450-520, so I must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps each coil has two conductors (since it's double-layer), so each coil contributes two parallel paths. So the number of turns per phase would be (number of coils per phase) * (turns per coil) * conductors per coil.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should move to part (b) now and see if that helps.

Part (b): total number of turns per phase. Let me try to compute that.

In a lap winding, the number of turns per phase can be calculated as (Z * a)/ (2 * m), where Z is the total number of conductors, a is the number of parallel paths, and m is the number of phases.

Wait, but Z is the total conductors, which is 72 slots *2 (double-layer) =144. So Z=144.

a is the number of parallel paths, which for lap winding is equal to the number of poles, so a=6.

m=3 phases.

So turns per phase = (Z * a) / (2 * m) ) = (144 *6)/(2*3) )= (864)/(6) =144 turns per phase. Hmm, but that's not matching any of the options either. The options for part (b) are around 460-520. So I must be doing something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. In a lap winding, each phase has (number of slots per pole per phase) * number of poles * number of turns per slot. Wait, number of slots per pole per phase is q=72/(3*6)=4. So q=4.

Each slot has two conductors, so per slot per phase, 2 conductors. So the number of conductors per phase is q * number of poles * number of conductors per slot. Wait, that would be 4 *6 *2=48 conductors per phase. Each conductor has 20 turns, so turns per phase would be 48 *20=960. Again, way higher than options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing that in a double-layer winding, the number of turns per phase is (slots * conductors per slot * turns per conductor) / (number of phases * 2). So (72*2*20)/(3*2) = (2880)/(6)=480. That would give 480 turns per phase. That's option B: (b) 480, which matches one of the options.

Wait, let me check that calculation. 72 slots, each with 2 conductors (double-layer), 20 turns per conductor. So total conductors: 72*2=144. Each conductor has 20 turns, so total turns would be 144*20=2880. Since it's a three-phase machine, each phase has 2880/3=960 turns. Wait, that's the same as before, which doesn't match any option except perhaps option B's 480.

Wait, maybe I'm not accounting for the fact that each conductor is part of two turns? No, that
