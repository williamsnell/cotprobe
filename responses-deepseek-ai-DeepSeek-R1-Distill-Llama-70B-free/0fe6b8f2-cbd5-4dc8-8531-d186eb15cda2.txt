Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Assume this question takes place in a "lien theory" state. A woman and her co-habiting partner share a property as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. He has run up debts that he did not tell her about, and so he uses his interest in the property to secretly get a mortgage from the bank. When he dies, the bank attempts to execute on the mortgage. Can it do so? Apply the majority view on this issue.

Options:

A: No, the mortgage lien could not destroy the joint tenancy, and when the partner dies, the property passes by operation of law to the surviving joint tenant.
B: No, although the mortgage destroyed the joint tenancy, the bank has to get a deed of trust in order to execute on jointly owned property.
C: Yes, the bank got title to the property by virtue of the mortgage, which destroyed the joint tenancy, and it can execute on its lien.
D: Yes, the mortgage was the equivalent of a deed of trust and the joint tenancy was severed by the mortgage lien, giving the bank unfettered legal authority to execute on its mortgage.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about property law, specifically regarding joint tenancy and mortgages in a lien theory state. Let me break down what I know and try to figure this out step by step.

First, the question is set in a "lien theory" state. From what I remember, in lien theory states, when a mortgage is created, it's considered a lien on the property rather than transferring legal title to the mortgagee (the bank). This is different from title theory states where the mortgagee holds the legal title until the loan is paid off.

The scenario involves a woman and her cohabiting partner who own a property as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. Joint tenancy means they both own the property together, and upon the death of one, the survivor automatically gets the deceased's share without going through probate. The key here is the right of survivorship.

Now, the partner has debts he didn't tell her about and uses his interest in the property to get a mortgage from the bank secretly. So he mortgages his share. The question is, when he dies, can the bank execute on the mortgage?

I need to think about what happens when a joint tenant mortgages their interest. In a joint tenancy, each tenant has an undivided right to the whole property, but upon mortgage, they're only mortgaging their own interest. But does that mortgage affect the joint tenancy?

I recall that when one joint tenant mortgages their interest, it can potentially sever the joint tenancy. Severance would convert the joint tenancy into a tenancy in common. However, this depends on the specific laws of the state, and the majority view on this issue.

In a lien theory state, a mortgage creates a lien on the property. So when the partner took out the mortgage, he was essentially creating a lien on his interest. But does this action sever the joint tenancy?

Wait, I think that in the majority view, a mortgage by one joint tenant on their interest does not sever the joint tenancy. Instead, the lien attaches only to that tenant's interest. So upon the death of the mortgaging tenant, their interest passes to the survivor through the right of survivorship, but what happens to the mortgage lien?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. If the mortgage is only on the deceased partner's interest, and upon death, that interest ceases to exist because it goes to the survivor, does the lien get extinguished?

Wait, no. The lien would typically attach to the property, so even if the joint tenancy continues, the lien remains. But in this case, the partner died, so the property would transfer to the woman. But wait, the mortgage was on his share. So does the woman take the property subject to the mortgage, or does the mortgage get wiped out because of the right of survivorship?

I think under the majority view, when a joint tenant mortgages their interest, upon their death, the mortgage lien is extinguished because the mortgaged interest is extinguished by the right of survivorship. So the surviving tenant takes the property free of the lien. But wait, that might not be the case in all jurisdictions.

Wait, no, another angle: in some states, a mortgage by one joint tenant only affects their own interest. So upon their death, that interest is gone, and the survivor gets the entire property, but the lien would only apply to the deceased's share, which is now gone. So the bank can't enforce the lien against the entire property because the deceased's share was only a part of it, but in joint tenancy, the shares are undivided.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to recall: in a lien theory state, the mortgage creates a lien on the title. If the mortgaging tenant dies, does the lien survive against the survivor's interest?

I think the majority view is that a mortgage by one joint tenant does not sever the joint tenancy. So when the mortgaging tenant dies, the survivor takes the entire property, and the mortgage lien is extinguished because the mortgaged interest (the deceased's share) no longer exists. Therefore, the bank cannot execute on the mortgage because there's nothing to execute againstâ€”the lien was only on the deceased's share, which has been extinguished.

So applying this to the options:

Option A says no, the mortgage lien couldn't destroy the joint tenancy, and upon death, the property passes to the survivor. That aligns with my conclusion.

Option C and D suggest that the mortgage destroyed the joint tenancy, allowing the bank to execute. But if the majority view is that the joint tenancy isn't severed, then these options might be incorrect.

Option B talks about needing a deed of trust, but that's more about the process of foreclosure, not the lien's validity. So probably not relevant here.

So, the correct answer should be A.

In a lien theory state, a mortgage creates a lien on the property rather than transferring legal title to the mortgagee. When one joint tenant mortgages their interest, the majority view holds that this action does not sever the joint tenancy. Instead, the lien attaches only to the mortgaging tenant's interest. Upon the death of the mortgaging tenant, the right of survivorship causes their interest to pass to the surviving joint tenant. Since the mortgage lien was only on the deceased tenant's interest, which is extinguished by the right of survivorship, the lien is also extinguished. The surviving tenant takes the property free of the lien, and the bank cannot execute on the mortgage.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** correctly reflects the majority view that the mortgage lien does not destroy the joint tenancy, and upon death, the property passes to the surviving joint tenant free of the lien.
- **Option B** incorrectly suggests that the bank needs a deed of trust, which is unrelated to the lien's validity in this context.
- **Options C and D** incorrectly imply that the mortgage destroyed the joint tenancy, allowing the bank to execute on the lien, which contradicts the majority view.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**A**

Answer: A
