Okay, so I have this problem about a screw and torque required to raise a load. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says it's a screw used in translation with a collar. The collar has an inside diameter of 22 mm and an outside diameter of 38 mm. The screw has a mean diameter of 18 mm and a single trapezoidal metric thread with a pitch of 4 mm. The load is 500 kg, and both the collar and threads have a coefficient of friction of 0.3.

I remember that the torque required for a screw is related to the frictional forces acting on the screw. Since there's a collar, it's probably a collar friction scenario, but the threads also have friction. So maybe I need to calculate the torque from both the collar and the threads and add them together.

First, let's break it down. The torque (T) is going to be the sum of the torque due to the collar (T_collar) and the torque due to the thread (T_thread).

Let me start with the collar. The formula for torque due to collar friction is T_collar = (Frictional Force) * radius. The frictional force here would be the normal force multiplied by the coefficient of friction. But wait, the normal force for the collar is the same as the load force, right? Because the collar is bearing the load.

Wait, no, the normal force for the collar is actually the same as the load force because the collar supports the entire load. So the normal force N = m * g, where m is the mass and g is acceleration due to gravity.

So m is 500 kg, so N = 500 kg * 9.81 m/s². Let me calculate that. 500 * 9.81 = 4905 N approximately.

The frictional force for the collar is μ * N. So 0.3 * 4905 N. Let's see, 0.3*4905 is 1471.5 N.

Now, the radius for the collar would be the outside diameter divided by 2, since that's where the frictional contact is. The outside diameter is 38 mm, so radius r_collar = 38/2 = 19 mm. But I need to convert that to meters for the units to be consistent. So 19 mm = 0.019 m.

So T_collar = 1471.5 N * 0.019 m. Let me calculate that. 1471.5 * 0.019 = approx 27.9485 Nm. Let me write that as about 27.95 Nm.

Now, onto the thread torque. The torque due to the threads is a bit different. I think the formula is T_thread = (μ * W * d_mean) / (2 * sin(θ)), but wait, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, I remember that for a screw thread, the torque can be calculated using the lead angle and the normal force.

Wait, maybe the approach is to calculate the frictional torque from the threads. The screw's mean diameter is 18 mm, so radius r_thread = 18/2 = 9 mm = 0.009 m.

The normal force here would be the same as the load, right? Because the threads are also supporting the load. So N = 4905 N same as before.

The frictional force for the thread is μ * N again, so same as collar: 1471.5 N.

Wait no, wait. Wait, no. Because the thread's torque is calculated differently. Because the screw thread's frictional torque comes from the helix angle. Hmm, maybe I should model the screw as an inclined plane.

So the torque due to the thread is related to the lead angle. The lead is the distance the screw advances per revolution, which is the pitch multiplied by the number of threads. Since it's a single thread, the lead is equal to the pitch, which is 4 mm or 0.004 m.

The lead angle θ can be found using tanθ = lead / (π * d_mean). So θ = arctan(0.004 / (π * 0.018)).

Let me compute that. 0.004 divided by (π * 0.018) is 0.004/(0.05655) ≈ 0.0707. So θ is arctan(0.0707) ≈ 4.05 degrees.

Now, the frictional torque on the thread would be the frictional force multiplied by the radius at which it acts. But wait, the frictional force is the same as μ * N, but I think I need to consider how the force is applied along the thread's surface.

Alternatively, another approach is to calculate the torque using the formula T = (μ * N * d_mean) / (2 * cosθ). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Wait, I think the torque due to friction in the threads is given by T_thread = (μ * N * r) / sin(α), where α is the thread angle, but I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, I've heard of the formula T = (F * μ * d) / (2), but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps it's better to model the thread as a wedge. The torque arises from the friction opposing the rotation as the screw is turned.

Wait, another approach: The torque required to overcome friction in the threads can be found by T_thread = (μ * N * r) / (tanθ), where θ is the lead angle.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

The frictional torque for the threads is the product of the frictional force and the moment arm, but perhaps the moment arm is related to the pitch and the lead angle.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the friction in the threads as contributing to the torque. The frictional force along the thread is μ * N. The component of this force that contributes to torque is μ * N * r, where r is the radius. But wait, no, because the direction of the force is along the thread, which is at an angle θ to the radius. So the component of the frictional force that causes torque is μ * N * r * sinθ, maybe?

Wait, perhaps I should consider the torque as T = F_friction * r, but F_friction is μ * N. So T_thread = μ * N * r, but that seems too simple. Wait, but I think this ignores the lead angle, which affects the effective torque.

Wait, no, because when you have a screw thread, the frictional resistance is influenced by the angle of the thread. So perhaps the torque due to the thread is μ * N * r / tanθ. Because the lead angle affects the 'lever arm' of the frictional force.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to calculate the torque from the thread as T_thread = (μ * N * r) / sinθ. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, I've come across the formula for torque on a screw due to friction as T = (μ * W * d) / (2 * sin(θ)), where W is the load and d is the mean diameter, and θ is the thread angle. But I'm not sure about the exact formula.

Wait, let me try to derive it. The frictional force is μ * N. The torque would be the frictional force multiplied by the radius, but adjusted by the angle θ, because the force is applied along the thread, which is at an angle.

So the component of the frictional force that's acting radially (i.e., contributing to torque) would be F_friction * sinθ, where θ is the lead angle. So T_thread = F_friction * r * sinθ.

Wait, but F_friction is μ * N. So T_thread = μ * N * r * sinθ.

Wait, let's plug in the numbers. μ is 0.3, N is 4905 N, r is 0.009 m, and sinθ is sin(4.05 degrees). Let's compute that.

sin(4.05°) ≈ 0.0705.

So T_thread = 0.3 * 4905 * 0.009 * 0.0705.

Let me compute step by step.

0.3 * 4905 = 1471.5.

1471.5 * 0.009 = 13.2335.

13.2335 * 0.0705 ≈ 0.933 Nm.

Wait, that seems really small compared to the collar torque of about 27.95 Nm.

Hmm, adding both torques would give a total of approximately 28.88 Nm. But looking at the options, none of them exactly match that. The closest I see is option H:28.82 Nm.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me double-check the T_thread calculation. Maybe I used the wrong approach.

Another approach I found online suggests that the torque due to thread friction is T_thread = (μ * N * d) / (2 * tanθ), where θ is the lead angle.

So, let me compute tanθ. θ is 4.05 degrees, so tanθ ≈ 0.0707.

So T_thread = (0.3 * 4905 N * 0.018 m) / (2 * 0.0707).

Compute numerator: 0.3 * 4905 = 1471.5. 1471.5 * 0.018 = 26.467 Nm.

Denominator: 2 * 0.0707 = 0.1414.

So 26.467 / 0.1414 ≈ 187.15 Nm. That's way too high, and when added to the collar torque, it's way beyond the options given.

Hmm, that can't be right. I must be mixing up some formulas.

Alternatively, perhaps the torque from the threads is negligible compared to the collar, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the torque due to the threads with the torque required to lift the load, which involves the mechanical advantage of the screw.

Wait, wait a second. The torque required to raise the load without considering friction is T = (F * p) / (2 * π), where p is the pitch. But that's without friction. So when friction is present, both the collar and thread contribute to the total torque.

Wait, let me think again. The total torque is the sum of torque due to collar friction and torque due to thread friction.

I think I made an error in the thread torque calculation earlier. Let me try a different approach. For a screw, the torque required is T = T_collar + T_thread.

T_collar = μ_collar * N * r_collar.

T_thread = μ_thread * N * r_thread / tanθ.

Wait, where θ is the lead angle.

So let's compute T_collar first.

μ_collar is 0.3, N is 4905 N, r_collar is 0.019 m.

T_collar = 0.3 * 4905 * 0.019.

Compute that:

0.3 * 4905 = 1471.5.

1471.5 * 0.019 = 27.9485 Nm ≈ 27.95 Nm.

Now, for T_thread, using the formula T_thread = (μ_thread * N * r_thread) / tanθ.

μ_thread is 0.3, N is 4905, r_thread is 0.009 m.

tanθ is 0.0707 as before.

So T_thread = (0.3 * 4905 * 0.009) / 0.0707.

Compute numerator: 0.3 * 4905 = 1471.5.

1471.5 * 0.009 = 13.2335.

So 13.2335 / 0.0707 ≈ 187.05 Nm.

That's a huge torque. Adding that to T_collar gives about 215 Nm, which is way beyond any of the options provided. So clearly, I'm doing something wrong here.

Wait, perhaps the formula for T_thread is incorrect. Maybe the torque due to thread friction is much smaller. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the torque from the threads as the product of the frictional force and the radius, without dividing by tanθ.

So T_thread = μ * N * r.

So 0.3 * 4905 * 0.009 = 13.2335 Nm.

Then total torque would be 27.95 + 13.2335 ≈ 41.18 Nm.

Looking at the options, option G is 42.82, which is close but not exact. Hmm.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the collar's radius.

Wait, the collar has an inside diameter of 22 mm, so radius is 11 mm, not 19 mm. Because the collar's outside diameter is 38 mm, but the load is supported on the inside, so the radius for the collar's friction is the inside radius.

Oh! That's a big mistake. Earlier, I used 19 mm for the collar's radius, but it's actually the inside diameter that's 22 mm, so radius is 11 mm, 0.011 m.

So let's recalculate T_collar.

T_collar = μ * N * r.

μ is 0.3, N is 4905 N, r is 0.011 m.

So T_collar = 0.3 * 4905 * 0.011.

0.3 * 4905 = 1471.5.

1471.5 * 0.011 = 16.1865 Nm.

Now, T_thread is μ * N * r_thread.

μ is 0.3, N is 4905, r_thread is 0.009 m.

So T_thread = 0.3 * 4905 * 0.009 = 13.2335 Nm.

So total torque T = 16.1865 + 13.2335 ≈ 29.42 Nm.

Looking at the options, the closest is option F:30.82, but it's not exact. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in units or somewhere else.

Wait, let me check the collar's radius again. The collar's inside diameter is 22 mm, so radius is 11 mm, which is 0.011 m. That's correct.

Wait, maybe I should consider the average of the inside and outside diameters for the collar's radius? No, because the collar's contact is on the inside diameter, so the radius should be the inner radius.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck all calculations.

Let me recalculate T_collar:

μ = 0.3, N = 500 kg * 9.81 = 4905 N.

r_collar = 22mm / 2 = 11mm = 0.011 m.

T_collar = 0.3 * 4905 N * 0.011 m.

0.3 * 4905 = 1471.5.

1471.5 * 0.011 = 16.1865 Nm.

T_thread:

μ = 0.3, N =4905 N, r_thread = 18mm/2=9mm=0.009 m.

T_thread = 0.3 * 4905 * 0.009.

0.3*4905=1471.5.

1471.5 * 0.009=13.2335 Nm.

Total T=16.1865 +13.2335=29.42 Nm.

The options don't have exactly 29.42, but let's see the options:

Options are A:45.82, B:35.82, C:25.82, D:55.82, E:50.82, F:30.82, G:42.82, H:28.82, I:39.82, J:60.82.

So 29.42 is closest to option F:30.82, but not exact. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to consider the correct mean diameter for the threads. The mean diameter might not be exactly 18mm. Wait, the screw has a mean diameter of 18 mm, so that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the pitch circle diameter for the threads, which would be the same as the mean diameter, so 18mm.

Wait, another approach is to calculate the torque using the formula that combines both collar and thread friction.

Wait, I found a formula that says the total torque required is T = (μ_collar * N * r_collar) + (μ_thread * N * r_thread) * (1 + (pitch)/(π d_mean)).

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the thread torque is calculated considering the lead angle. Let me think.

Wait, the lead angle θ is tanθ = (pitch)/(π d_mean) = 4 mm / (π * 18 mm) = 4/(56.548) ≈ 0.0707, so θ ≈ 4.05 degrees.

The torque due to thread friction is T_thread = μ * N * r * sinθ, where r is the mean radius.

So T_thread = 0.3 * 4905 * 0.009 * sin(4.05°).

Sin(4.05)≈0.0705.

So 0.3 *4905=1471.5.

1471.5 *0.009=13.2335.

13.2335 *0.0705≈0.933 Nm.

So total T=16.1865 (collar) +0.933≈17.12 Nm. That's even lower than before. None of the options are close to that.

Hmm, I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the torque due to the collar is calculated using the outside diameter because the collar's outer edge is what's in contact with the screw. Wait, the collar is fixed, and the screw rotates inside it. So the radius would be the outer radius of the screw, which is the mean diameter plus half the pitch? Or perhaps the major diameter.

Wait, wait. The collar is fixed, and the screw rotates inside the collar. So the radius for the collar's friction is the outer radius of the screw, which is (outside diameter)/2.

Wait, but the screw has an inside diameter and outside diameter, but I think in the context of a screw with a single thread, the mean diameter is the average of the major and minor diameters.

Wait, but the problem says the screw has a mean diameter of 18 mm. So the major diameter (outside) would be larger than that.

Wait, but the collar's inside diameter is 22 mm, so the screw's outside diameter must be less than or equal to 22 mm, otherwise it wouldn't fit.

Wait, the collar's inside diameter is 22 mm, so the screw's outside diameter must be less than 22 mm. But the problem doesn't
