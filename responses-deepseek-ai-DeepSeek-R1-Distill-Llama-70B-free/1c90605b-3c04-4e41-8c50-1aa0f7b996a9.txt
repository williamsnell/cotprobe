Question:

A monopoly is less efficient than a perfect competitor because

Options:

A: a monopoly can make profit in the short run but not in the long run
B: a monopoly can control the supply and demand of the market
C: a perfect competitor can make profit in the short run but the monopoly cannot
D: a perfect competitor breaks even in the short run and the monopoly does not
E: a monopoly sells for a lower price and produces more output
F: a monopoly produces more output and sells for a higher price
G: a monopoly has no competition, therefore it is less efficient
H: a perfect competitor produces more output and sells for a lower price
I: a perfect competitor breaks even in the long run and the monopoly does not
J: a monopoly produces less output and sells for a higher price

Okay, so I have this question about monopolies and perfect competition. Hmm, I remember from my economics class that monopolies and perfect competition are two different market structures. I think perfect competition is where there are lots of firms producing similar products, so no single firm can influence the market price. Monopolies, on the other hand, are when there's only one seller in the market, so they have a lot of power.

The question is asking why a monopoly is less efficient than a perfect competitor. The options are A through J. I need to figure out the right answer.

First, I should probably recall what efficiency means in this context. I think economic efficiency involves producing at the lowest possible cost and allocating resources effectively. So, a monopoly might not do that as well as a perfectly competitive market.

In perfect competition, firms produce where price equals marginal cost. That's the efficient outcome because it means consumers are paying exactly what it costs to produce the last unit. But in a monopoly, the firm is a price maker. They can set the price higher than marginal cost because there's no competition to undercut them. So, they might produce less and charge more.

Wait, so if a monopoly produces less and sells at a higher price, that's less efficient. Because in perfect competition, more is produced at a lower price, which is better for consumers and more efficient overall.

Looking at the options:

Option J says a monopoly produces less output and sells for a higher price. That sounds right. Option F says a monopoly produces more and sells higher, which doesn't make sense. Monopolies restrict output to maximize profits, so F is wrong.

Option H is about perfect competitors producing more and selling lower. That might be part of the efficient outcome, but the question is about why the monopoly is less efficient.

Option E suggests a monopoly sells lower and produces more, which contradicts what I think. So E is incorrect.

Option G says a monopoly has no competition, so it's less efficient. While it's true they have no competition, is that the direct reason for inefficiency? Or is it the outcome of producing less and higher prices? I think the efficiency loss is specifically because they produce less and charge more, not just because there's no competition.

Options A, C, D, I talk about profits and breaking even. I don't think that's the main point here. The question is about efficiency, which relates more to output and price levels rather than profit in the short or long run.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be J: a monopoly produces less output and sells for a higher price. That leads to allocative inefficiency because they're not producing where price equals marginal cost.

A monopoly is less efficient than a perfect competitor because it produces less output and sells at a higher price, leading to allocative inefficiency. This is in contrast to perfect competition, where firms produce where price equals marginal cost, ensuring a more efficient allocation of resources.

The correct answer is:

J: a monopoly produces less output and sells for a higher price.

Answer: J
