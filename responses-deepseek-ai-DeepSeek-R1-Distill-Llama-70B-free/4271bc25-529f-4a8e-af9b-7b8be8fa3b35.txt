Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the rate of return on this machine purchase. Let me see if I understand the problem correctly. The machine costs $1,000, and it saves me $150 each year for the next 10 years. I need to find the rate of return on this investment.

Hmm, I remember that the rate of return calculations often involve some kind of average or maybe the internal rate of return. Since this seems like a series of equal annual savings, it's probably an annuity problem. Right, the internal rate of return for an annuity might be what I need here.

So, the formula I think I should use is the one for the internal rate of return (IRR) of an annuity. The IRR is the discount rate that makes the net present value (NPV) of the investment zero. That means the present value of the cash inflows equals the initial investment cost.

The formula for the NPV of an annuity is:
NPV = PMT × [(1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r]

Where:
- PMT is the annual payment (savings here, so $150)
- r is the discount rate (what we're solving for)
- n is the number of periods (10 years)

So, setting NPV equal to the initial cost:
$1,000 = $150 × [(1 - (1 + r)^-10) / r]

I need to solve for r. Hmm, this equation doesn't have a straightforward algebraic solution because r is in the denominator and exponent. I think I'll have to use trial and error or an approximation method.

Alternatively, I remember that there's a formula for the internal rate of return for an annuity, but I can't recall it exactly. Maybe I can try plugging in the answer choices to see which one gets me close to the initial investment.

Let me try option A: 14%. Let's see.

Calculate the present value factor for each $1 saved annually at 14% for 10 years. The formula for the present value of an annuity is [1 - (1 + r)^-n] / r.

So, r=0.14, n=10.

First, calculate (1.14)^10. 1.14^10 is approximately 2.9749 (I remember that 1.1^10 is about 2.5937, so 0.14 is higher, so maybe around 3).

Wait, no, let me compute it step by step. 1.14^1 is 1.14. 1.14^2 is 1.2996. 1.14^3 is about 1.4815, 1.14^4 ≈ 1.68896, 1.14^5 ≈ 1.9254, 1.14^6 ≈ 2.19497, 1.14^7 ≈ 2.50239, 1.14^8 ≈ 2.85653, 1.14^9 ≈ 3.26289, 1.14^10≈ 3.72309 (Wait, no, maybe I'm miscalculating. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the present value factor formula.)

Wait, perhaps I should compute the denominator first. Wait, the present value factor for the annuity is [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r.

So for r=14% (0.14), n=10.

(1.14)^10 = let me calculate that correctly. Using exponents, perhaps. Alternatively, use logarithms, but that might get complicated. Alternatively, I can use approximation or perhaps a financial calculator approach in my head.

Wait, I know that at 10%, the present value factor for 10 years is about 6.1446 (since PVIFA(10,10%)=6.1446). At 14%, it's lower because the discount rate is higher.

Alternatively, the present value of $150 per year for 10 years at 14% would be 150 * [1 - (1.14)^-10]/0.14.

Compute denominator 0.14 first.

Calculate (1.14)^-10: 1/(1.14)^10. Let me approximate (1.14)^10. Let's see: 1.14^2 = 1.2996. 1.14^4 = (1.2996)^2 ≈ 1.68896. 1.14^5 = 1.68896 * 1.14 ≈ 1.9254. 1.14^10 is (1.9254) squared, which is about 3.708. So 1/3.708 ≈ 0.2697.

So [1 - 0.2697] = 0.7303. Now divide by 0.14: 0.7303/0.14 ≈ 5.216. Then multiply by 150: 5.216 * 150 = 782.45.

So at 14%, the present value is $782.45, which is less than the $1,000 cost. So the rate must be lower than 14% because the present value is less than the initial investment. So the correct rate should be lower than 14%, so option A is too high.

Let's try option D: 10%. As I mentioned, PVIFA(10,10%)=6.1446. So 150 * 6.1446 = 921.69. That's still less than 1000, so 10% is too low because the present value is 921.69, less than 1000. So the actual rate is higher than 10%.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no, wait a second. If at 10% the present value is 921.69, which is less than 1000, that suggests that the return is higher than 10% because the present value is lower. Because higher discount rates lower the present value. So if at 10%, the PV is 921.69, which is less than 1000, the IRR must be higher than 10%, because when you increase the discount rate, the PV decreases.

Wait, but in this case, the PV is 921.69 at 10%, which is less than the initial outlay of 1000. So that would imply that the rate of return is higher than 10%, because at 10% the present value is less than the cost. Hmm, maybe I got that backwards. Wait, let me think.

The NPV is the PV of inflows minus the initial cost. So if at 10%, PV inflows is 921.69, so NPV is 921.69 - 1000 = -78.31. So the NPV is negative, meaning that the project isn't profitable at 10%. So the IRR must be higher than 10% because higher discount rates will lower the PV further, but wait, no, higher rates would make the PV even lower, so the IRR is the rate where NPV=0. So if at 10% it's negative, and at lower rates it's positive, so the IRR is between 0% and 10%? Wait, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because when the discount rate increases, the PV of the inflows decreases. So when you calculate the IRR, you look for the rate where the PV of inflows equals the initial outlay. So if at 10%, PV is 921.69, which is less than 1000, that suggests that the IRR is less than 10% because a lower discount rate would give a higher PV. For example, at 0% discount rate, the PV would be 150*10=1500, which is way more than 1000. So as the discount rate increases, PV decreases. So the IRR is the point where PV=1000.

So if at 10% it's 921.69, which is below 1000, then the IRR is lower than 10%. Wait, no, that's conflicting with my earlier thought.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of trial and error with the options given. Let me try option I: 7.5%. Let's compute the PVIFA at 7.5% for 10 years.

PVIFA = [1 - (1 + 0.075)^-10 ] / 0.075.

Calculate (1.075)^10. Let me compute 1.075^10.

1.075^2 = 1.075 * 1.075 = 1.1556.

1.075^4 = (1.1556)^2 ≈ 1.3353.

1.075^5 = 1.3353 * 1.075 ≈ 1.3353 * 1.075. Let's compute that: 1.3353 * 1 = 1.3353, 1.3353 * 0.075 ≈ 0.10015. So total ≈ 1.4355.

1.075^10 = (1.4355)^2 ≈ 2.0625.

Wait, that's approximate, but perhaps a better way is to compute (1.075)^10.

Alternatively, I can use the rule of 72 to get a rough idea, but maybe it's easier to proceed.

So (1.075)^10 ≈ 1.075^10 ≈ 1.075^5 squared. Wait, 1.075^5 is approximately 1.4071 (exact value is around 1.4071). Then 1.075^10 is (1.4071)^2 ≈ 1.978.

So 1/(1.075)^10 ≈ 1/1.978 ≈ 0.5057.

So [1 - 0.5057] = 0.4943.

Divide by 0.075: 0.4943 / 0.075 ≈ 6.59.

Multiply by 150: 150 * 6.59 ≈ 988.5.

That's very close to 1000. So the PV is approximately 988.5 at 7.5%. That's just a bit below 1000. So maybe the IRR is a little over 7.5%. Let's try option C: 8.0516%.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is around 7.5%, but let's check.

Wait, at 7.5%, the present value is about 988.5, which is slightly less than 1000. So perhaps the exact IRR is a bit higher than 7.5%.

Wait, but option I is 7.5%, and option C is 8.0516%. Let me try option E: 8.5%.

Wait, maybe I should use a better approach. Let's try to compute the PVIFA at 8%.

PVIFA(10,8%) = [1 - (1.08)^-10 ] / 0.08.

Compute (1.08)^10. I remember that 1.08^10 is approximately 2.1589.

So 1/2.1589 ≈ 0.4632.

So [1 - 0.4632] = 0.5368.

0.5368 / 0.08 = 6.71.

Multiply by 150: 6.71 * 150 = 1006.5.

That's very close to 1000. So at 8%, the present value is about 1006.5, which is just a bit over 1000. So the IRR is around 8%, because at 8% the PV is slightly above 1000, and at 7.5% it's slightly below. So the exact IRR is between 7.5% and 8%.

Wait, but let me check option C: 8.0516%. Let's compute PVIFA at 8.0516%.

Hmm, that might be time-consuming, but perhaps I can use linear approximation. Let's say at 8%, PV is 1006.5, and at 7.5%, it's 988.5.

Wait, no, wait earlier I thought at 7.5% it was 988.5, and at 8% it's 1006.5. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when the discount rate increases, the PV should decrease. So perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier calculation.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, at 7.5%, the PV is 988.5, and at 8% it's 1006.5? That can't be right because higher discount rates should lower the PV.

Wait, no, I must have made a mistake. Let me recalculate.

Wait, when I computed at 7.5%, I thought that (1.075)^10 is approximately 1.978, so (1.075)^-10 is about 0.5057. So [1 - 0.5057] = 0.4943. Divided by 0.075 gives 6.59. Multiply by 150 gives 988.5.

At 8%, (1.08)^10 is approximately 2.1589. So (1.08)^-10 ≈ 0.4632. [1 - 0.4632] = 0.5368. Divided by 0.08 gives 6.71. Multiply by 150 gives 1006.5.

Wait, but this suggests that at a higher discount rate (8%), the present value is higher than at 7.5%. That contradicts what I know. Higher discount rates should lower the present value. So I must have made a mistake in my calculations.

Ah, wait, no. Because when the discount rate increases, the denominator in the PVIFA formula increases, which would decrease the PVIFA. Wait, but in my calculations, when I went from 7.5% to 8%, the PVIFA increased from 6.59 to 6.71, which is the opposite of what should happen.

So I must have made a mistake in calculating (1.08)^10. Let me double-check that.

Wait, (1.08)^10 is actually approximately 2.1589. So (1.08)^-10 is 1/2.1589 ≈ 0.4632.

So [1 - 0.4632] is 0.5368. Divided by 0.08 is 6.71. So yes, that's correct. So the PVIFA at 8% is indeed higher than at 7.5%, which would imply that the present value of the annuity increases as the discount rate decreases. Wait, that makes sense because a lower discount rate gives a higher present value.

So at 7.5%, the PV is 988.5; at 8%, it's 1006.5. Wait, no, that can't be. Because 8% is a higher rate than 7.5%, so the PV should be lower at 8% than at 7.5%. So if at 7.5% the PV is 988.5, and at 8% it's 1006.5, that's impossible. I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I confused the numbers. Let me recompute.

At 7.5%:

(1.075)^10 ≈ let me calculate it more accurately.

1.075^1 = 1.075

1.075^2 = 1.075 * 1.075 = 1.155625

1.075^3 = 1.155625 * 1.075 ≈ 1.24106

1.075^4 ≈ 1.24106 * 1.075 ≈ 1.3344

1.075^5 ≈ 1.3344 * 1.075 ≈ 1.4334

1.075^6 ≈ 1.4334 * 1.075 ≈ 1.5403

1.075^7 ≈ 1.5403 * 1.075 ≈ 1.6548

1.075^8 ≈ 1.6548 * 1.075 ≈ 1.7783

1.075^9 ≈ 1.7783 * 1.075 ≈ 1.9115

1.075^10 ≈ 1.9115 * 1.075 ≈ 2.0567

So (1.075)^10 ≈ 2.0567, so (1.075)^-10 ≈ 1/2.0567 ≈ 0.4862.

So [1 - 0.4862] = 0.5138.

Divide by 0.075: 0.5138 / 0.075 ≈ 6.8507.

Multiply by 150: 6.8507 * 150 ≈ 1027.6.

Wait, that's way higher than before. So at 7.5%, the PV is about 1027.6, which is higher than the initial investment of 1000. So the NPV is positive, which means the rate of return is higher than 7.5%.

At 8%, let's recalculate (1.08)^10 more accurately.

1.08^1=1.08

1.08^2=1.1664

1.08^3=1.2597

1.08^4=1.3605

1.08^5=1.4693

1.08^6=1.5868

1.08^7=1.7138

1.08^8=1.8509

1.08^9=1.9997

1.08^10≈2.1589.

So (1.08)^-10 ≈ 0.4632.

[1 - 0.4632] = 0.5368.

Divide by 0.08: 0.5368 / 0.08 = 6.71.

Multiply by 150: 6.71 * 150 = 1006.5.

So at 8%, the PV is 1006.5, which is higher than 1000. So the NPV is positive.

Wait, but that can't be right because when I increase the discount rate from 7.5% to 8%, the PV decreases from 1027.6 to 1006.5, which is correct. So the IRR is the rate where PV equals 1000.

Between 8% and 7.5%, the PV goes from 1006.5 (at 8%) to 1027.6 (at 7.5%). Wait, no, that's impossible because as the rate increases, PV should decrease.

Wait, wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me clarify:

At 7.5%, the PV is 1027.6, which is higher than 1000.

At 8%, the PV is 1006.5, which is still higher than 1000.

Wait
