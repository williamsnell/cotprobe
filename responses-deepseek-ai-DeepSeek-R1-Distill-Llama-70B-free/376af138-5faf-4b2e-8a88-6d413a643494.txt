Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the cost of operating a lamp. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my electrical calculations, but let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question says the lamp requires 1.0 amp on a 100-volt line, and we need to find the cost of operating it for 24 hours. The cost of electricity is $0.50 per kilowatt-hour. 

Wait, first things first. I remember that power is calculated using voltage and current. Oh right, the formula is P = V * I. But wait, voltage is in volts, current in amps, so the unit would be watts. Right, because 1 watt is 1 volt times 1 amp.

So plugging in the numbers: P = 100 V * 1.0 A = 100 watts. Okay, so the lamp uses 100 watts of power.

But wait, the cost is given in dollars per kilowatt-hour. Hmm, I need to convert watts to kilowatts because the billing is in kWÂ·h. Oh yeah, 1 kilowatt is 1000 watts. So 100 watts is 0.1 kilowatts.

Now, power is energy per unit time, so to find the energy consumed over 24 hours, I need to calculate the total kilowatt-hours used. The formula should be Energy (kWh) = Power (kW) * Time (hours).

So the power is 0.1 kW, and the time is 24 hours. So Energy = 0.1 * 24 = 2.4 kWh. 

Wait, no, wait. 0.1 times 24 is 2.4? Let me double-check that. 0.1 is like 1/10, so 24 divided by 10 is 2.4. Yep, that's right. So 2.4 kWh consumed.

Now, the cost is $0.50 per kWh. So total cost would be 2.4 kWh multiplied by $0.50 per kWh. Let's calculate that: 2.4 * 0.5 = 1.2. So that's $1.20.

Looking at the options, option G is $1.20. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Did I miss a decimal point somewhere? Let me go through the steps again.

Power: 100 V * 1 A = 100 W. Correct. Convert to kW: 100/1000 = 0.1 kW. Right. Time is 24 hours. So 0.1 * 24 = 2.4 kWh. Then 2.4 * 0.5 = 1.2 dollars. Yep, that's $1.20 which is option G.

I think that's solid. No mistakes here.

To determine the cost of operating the lamp for 24 hours, we start by calculating the power consumption using the formula:

\[
P = V \cdot I
\]

Given \( V = 100 \, \text{V} \) and \( I = 1.0 \, \text{A} \), the power is:

\[
P = 100 \cdot 1.0 = 100 \, \text{W}
\]

Next, we convert the power to kilowatts:

\[
P = \frac{100}{1000} = 0.1 \, \text{kW}
\]

The energy consumed over 24 hours is then calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Energy (kWh)} = \text{Power (kW)} \cdot \text{Time (hours)}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Energy} = 0.1 \cdot 24 = 2.4 \, \text{kWh}
\]

Finally, the cost of electricity is given as $0.50 per kWh. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[
\text{Cost} = 2.4 \cdot 0.5 = 1.2 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Thus, the cost of operating the lamp for 24 hours is **$1.20**, which corresponds to option G.

Answer: G
