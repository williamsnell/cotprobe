Alright, I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question about the percentage of children in Ethiopia who reported physical punishment by teachers in 2009. The options given range from as low as 8% to as high as 98%, so I need to narrow this down.

First, I remember that Ethiopia has had issues with corporal punishment in schools, but I'm not sure about the exact statistics. I think in many developing countries, especially in Africa, physical punishment in schools was more common, but there have been efforts to reduce it.

Wait, I recall that UNICEF often conducts surveys on such issues. Maybe they have data from around that time. I think in some countries, the rates were quite high, like over 50%. But I'm not certain about Ethiopia specifically.

I also remember reading that in some East African countries, the percentage of children experiencing physical punishment at school was around 50-60%. But I'm not sure if Ethiopia was one of them.

Another angle: considering the year 2009, maybe the data is from a specific report. I think the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) by UNICEF collect such data. If I recall correctly, Ethiopia's data might have shown a significant percentage, but I'm trying to remember if it was closer to 50% or higher.

Wait, I'm a bit confused between Ethiopia and another country. I'm pretty sure that some countries in sub-Saharan Africa had rates above 70%, but I'm not sure about Ethiopia. Alternatively, maybe it's lower because of cultural or policy differences.

Alternatively, I might be mixing this up with data from other regions. For example, in some Latin American countries, the rates were lower, but in parts of Asia, they could be higher.

Wait, I think I remember a specific statistic: around 68% of children in Ethiopia experiencing physical punishment. That would correspond to option E. But I'm not 100% sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's lower. Let me think again. If the options are A:38%, B:48%, etc., and I'm considering that E is 68%, which is higher than half. I'm trying to remember if Ethiopia was one of the countries with higher rates.

Another thought: physical punishment by teachers might be higher in certain regions within Ethiopia, but the national average could be lower. Or perhaps it's around 50%, making B:48% or D:58% possible.

Wait, I think I'm confusing this with another study. Maybe the correct figure is around 68%, which would make E the answer. But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps it's lower, like 38%. I'm a bit torn between these options. Without more specific knowledge, I have to make an educated guess.

Based on what I think I remember, I'm going to go with E:68%.
