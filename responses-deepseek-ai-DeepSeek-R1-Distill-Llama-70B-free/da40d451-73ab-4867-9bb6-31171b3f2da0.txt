Question:

A plaintiff sued the insurer of her home after the insurer denied coverage for water damage to the home allegedly caused by a frozen plastic pipe that burst. At trial, the insurer called as an expert witness an engineer, who testified that the pipe had burst because of age rather than freezing. On cross-examination, the engineer admitted that five years earlier, he had been convicted of tax fraud, even though he had asserted that it was his accountant's error. In response, the insurer calls a witness, who is well acquainted with the engineer and his reputation, to testify that (1) in the witness's opinion, the engineer is a truthful person, and (2) the engineer's neighbors all describe him as a truthful person. How much, if any, of the witness's testimony is admissible?

Options:

A: None of the testimony is admissible, because it is collateral, having no bearing on the engineer's qualifications as an expert.
B: Only the portion concerning the engineer's reputation is admissible, because where both opinion and reputation evidence are available, only the latter is admissible under a rule of preference.
C: Both portions of the testimony are admissible, but only as they relate to the engineer's truthfulness, not his expertise.
D: None of the testimony is admissible, because character evidence is not relevant to the engineer's expertise.
E: All of the testimony is admissible to support the engineer's credibility.
F: Only the portion concerning the engineer's reputation is admissible, as it is directly relevant to his character for truthfulness.
G: Only the portion concerning the witness's opinion of the engineer's character is admissible, as it directly relates to his credibility.
H: Only the portion concerning the witness's opinion of the engineer's character, because the witness's reporting of the neighbors' comments is hearsay.
I: None of the testimony is admissible, because the witness is biased due to their acquaintance with the engineer.
J: All of the testimony is admissible, but the judge must instruct the jury to consider the engineer's past conviction.

Okay, let's try to work through this evidence question. So, the scenario is a trial where the plaintiff is suing her home insurer because they denied coverage for water damage. The insurer called an engineer as an expert witness, and he testified that the pipe burst due to age, not freezing. On cross-examination, the engineer admitted to a past conviction for tax fraud, though he claims it was his accountant's mistake. Now, the insurer is calling another witness to testify about the engineer's truthfulness.

The witness is going to testify two things: first, their opinion that the engineer is truthful, and second, that the engineer's neighbors describe him as truthful. The question is about the admissibility of this testimony.

Hmm. So, the first thought is about impeachment and rehabilitating a witness's credibility. The engineer's credibility was attacked because of the conviction, which suggests he might not be truthful. So, the insurer wants to counter that by showing he's actually truthful.

I remember that when a witness's character for truthfulness is attacked, the opposing party can offer evidence to rebut that. But there are rules about how you can do that. 

I think under the Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically Rule 405, when character evidence is used, it's usually through reputation or opinion. Also, Rule 608 deals with specific instances of conduct but has limitations.

Wait, in this case, the engineer was convicted of tax fraud, which is a crime of dishonesty. That's a felony, so it's admissible to impeach his credibility under Rule 609. But he claims it was the accountant's fault, so maybe that's a way to mitigate the impact of the conviction.

Now, when a witness's credibility is attacked, the party may offer evidence to support the witness's character. But there are specific ways to do this. For lay witnesses, you can offer opinion or reputation evidence about their character for truthfulness. But for expert witnesses, I'm not sure if the same rules apply because their credibility as experts is more about their qualifications and reliability, not necessarily their truthfulness.

Wait, no, the expert's credibility as a witness is still a factor. So, if the expert's credibility is impeached by a conviction for dishonesty, the party can rebut that by showing that the expert is truthful.

Rule 405 says that in cases where character evidence is admissible, it can be proved by testimony about reputation or opinion. But when? Specifically, (a) says that in cases where a person's character is admissible, it can be proved by testimony about reputation or opinion. But (b) says that when character is an essential element of a charge, claim, or defense, then specific instances can also be used. But here, the engineer's truthfulness isn't an essential element; it's just about his credibility as a witness.

So, to rebut the impeachment, the insurer can offer opinion or reputation evidence about the engineer's truthfulness.

So, the witness is testifying both their opinion and the reputation in the community. Are both admissible?

Wait, but under Rule 405(a), when character evidence is admissible, you can choose either reputation or opinion. So you can use either, but not both. Or can you present both? Wait, no, I think it's that you can use either method, but the rule doesn't prevent using both if allowed.

Wait, no, actually, I think the rule allows for either method. So a witness can testify about their opinion of the person's character, or about their reputation in the community. But both aren't necessary, but if they are offered, both could be admissible as long as they are relevant and not barred by other rules.

Wait, but in the case of expert witnesses, is their character for truthfulness even relevant? Because their testimony is based on their expertise, not their general credibility. Hmm, but wait, the engineer's credibility as a witness was attacked because of the conviction. So, the insurer is trying to rebut that attack by showing he's truthful, which would make his testimony more credible.

But wait, I think that for lay witnesses, you can rebut an attack on their credibility with character evidence, but for expert witnesses, the primary concern is their qualifications and the reliability of their methodology, not their truthfulness. So, maybe the expert's credibility as a truth-teller isn't as critical because their testimony is based on their expertise.

But that doesn't seem right. If an expert is shown to be dishonest, that affects their credibility as a witness, regardless of their expertise. So the insurer should be allowed to rebut that.

So, going back to the evidence. The witness is testifying about two things: their opinion that the engineer is truthful, and that the neighbors say he's truthful, which is about his reputation.

So both would be admissible under Rule 405(a), which allows either opinion or reputation testimony when character is admissible. So, the opinion is admissible, and the reputation is also admissible.

Wait, but wait another thing. There's a rule that when a witness's character has been attacked, the opposing party can offer evidence to support the witness's character, but it's limited to reputation or opinion, not specific instances beyond the conviction.

So, in this case, the insurer is offering both the opinion and reputation evidence. Both should be admissible because Rule 405 allows for either method.

But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on whether both can be presented or if only one is allowed. Because sometimes, the rules might limit you to one method, but I don't think so. I think you can present both if they're relevant.

So, looking at the options:

Option E says all of the testimony is admissible to support the engineer's credibility. So that would mean both the opinion and the reputation parts are allowed.

Option H says only the opinion is admissible because the reputation part is hearsay. Wait, no, reputation evidence isn't hearsay. Reputation is specifically defined under the rules as not being hearsay because it's about the community's opinion, so it's admissible under Rule 803(21) as an exception.

Wait, no. Rule 803(21) includes reputation as to character as a hearsay exception. So, when the witness testifies about the engineer's reputation for truthfulness in the community, that's not hearsay because it falls under the exception.

So, both the opinion and reputation testimony are admissible. Therefore, the answer would be E.

But wait, let me check. Is the reputation testimony about the neighbors' opinions hearsay? Because the witness is reporting what the neighbors say. But reputation is about the community's opinion, so it's not offered for the truth of the matter (that the engineer is truthful) but to show his reputation. So, it's not hearsay because it's covered by the exception.

Therefore, both parts are admissible. So the answer is E.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is about whether the testimony is admissible. So, both the opinion and the reputation are admissible. So, option E says all is admissible to support credibility.

But another thought: the expert's credibility as a witness is at issue, so evidence about his truthfulness is relevant. So yes, both opinion and reputation are admissible.

So, the answer should be E.

The question revolves around the admissibility of testimony offered by the insurer to rehabilitate the credibility of their expert witness, an engineer, after his credibility was impeached before the jury. The engineer was convicted of tax fraud, which suggests a potential lack of truthfulness, and the insurer seeks to counter this by presenting testimony about the engineer's truthfulness. The testimony in question includes two parts: (1) the witness's opinion that the engineer is truthful and (2) the engineer's reputation for truthfulness in his community, as described by his neighbors.

Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically Rule 405(a), when a witness's character for truthfulness has been attacked, the opposing party may offer evidence to rebut the attack. This evidence can take the form of either opinion testimony or reputation testimony. Both methods are explicitly allowed under Rule 405(a). 

- The witness's opinion that the engineer is truthful is admissible under Rule 405(a) as a direct assessment of the engineer's character for truthfulness.
- The testimony about the engineer's reputation for truthfulness in his community is also admissible under Rule 405(a). Reputation evidence is specifically exempt from hearsay under Rule 803(21) because it reflects the community's collective opinion, not the truth of the matter asserted.

Since both the opinion and reputation evidence are admissible to support the engineer's credibility, the insurer's witness can testify to both points. There is no rule prohibiting the use of both methods together, and both are relevant to rebutting the attack on the engineer's credibility.

Thus, all of the testimony is admissible to support the engineer's credibility.
