Okay, so I've got this biology question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about the consequences of intense interspecific competition. Hmm. I remember that interspecific competition is when different species compete for the same resources. So, like if two bird species are after the same type of seeds, they're competing.

The question gives me several options, from A to J. I need to pick the right one. Let me think about what happens when competition is really intense. I think one of the big ideas here is the competitive exclusion principle. Oh right, that's when one species outcompetes another, leading the other to extinction or forcing it into a different niche. So maybe that's part of the answer.

Looking at the options, I see option G says "extinction of rival species, evolution in divergent directions, and the principle of competitive exclusion." That sounds familiar. Wait, maybe also character displacement? Oh, that's when competing species evolve different traits to use different resources, so they diverge. So that's the divergent evolution part.

Another point: if competition is intense, it's hard for both species to coexist. So one might go extinct, or they might evolve to not compete so much anymore. So the consequences would include possible extinction and changes in how they evolve.

Looking at the other options: Option A is increased species diversity. Wait, no, intense competition might actually decrease it because some species can't survive. So A is probably wrong.

Option B is homogenization of species traits. That doesn't sound right. If they compete, wouldn't they become more different, not the same? So B might not be it.

Option C says decreased genetic diversity within species. Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe if a population is under strong competition, it could affect genetics, but I don't think that's the direct consequence here.

Option D is spontaneous generation of new species. That seems unrelated. Speciation is a thing, but I don't think it's a direct result of competition in this context.

Option E talks about identical ecological niches. If they're competing, they might actually diverge to have different niches. So E is probably incorrect.

Option F, creation of new resources. I don't think competition creates new resources; it's more about using existing ones.

Option H suggests unrestricted population growth for both species. That doesn't make sense because competition would limit growth, not allow it to be unrestricted.

Option I is about mutualistic relationships. Those are cooperative, which is the opposite of competition, so I don't think that's right.

Option J mentions enhanced cooperation. Again, competition is about conflict, not cooperation, so J is unlikely.

So circling back to option G. It mentions extinction, divergent evolution, and competitive exclusion. That fits with what I remember about the effects of intense competition. So the answer should be G.

The consequences of intense interspecific competition typically involve the principle of competitive exclusion, where one species may outcompete another, potentially leading to extinction. Additionally, such competition can drive divergent evolution, where species evolve different traits to occupy distinct ecological niches and reduce competition. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J** do not align with the expected outcomes of intense interspecific competition.
- **G** correctly captures the key consequences: extinction of rival species, evolution in divergent directions, and the principle of competitive exclusion.

Answer: G
