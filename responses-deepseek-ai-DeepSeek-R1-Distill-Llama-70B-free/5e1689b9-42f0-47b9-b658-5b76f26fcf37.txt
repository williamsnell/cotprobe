Question:

An experiment was performed to determine the moles of carbon dioxide gas formed (collected over water) when an acid reacts with limestone. To do this, a piece of dry limestone was weighed. Then carbon dioxide was collected until the limestone disappeared. The atmospheric pressure was measured at 0.965 atm. The temperature was 295 K. The volume of CO2 was measured to the nearest mL and corrected for the vapor pressure of water. The student continuously got low results from what was expected. Can you suggest why?

Options:

A: Perhaps there was too much acid, which interfered with the results.
B: The measurement of atmospheric pressure was incorrect.
C: Carbon dioxide is rather soluble in water.
D: The temperature might have affected the reaction.
E: Limestone is Ca(HCO3)2.
F: The limestone did not fully disappear.
G: Limestone is never pure CaCO3.
H: Perhaps there was not enough acid to dissolve all the limestone.
I: The volume of CO2 was not measured correctly.
J: The vapor pressure of water was not correctly accounted for.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the student got low results when measuring the moles of CO2 formed from the reaction of acid with limestone. Let me think about what's happening here.

The setup: They weighed a dry limestone sample. Then, they reacted it with acid until the limestone disappeared, collecting CO2 over water. The atmospheric pressure was 0.965 atm, and the temperature was 295 K. They corrected the CO2 volume for water vapor pressure. But the results were consistently low.

Hmm. Let me go through the possible issues. 

So, the expected result is based on the reaction between acid and CaCO3. The stoichiometry should be 1 mole of CaCO3 producing 1 mole of CO2. If the student's results are lower than expected, maybe they didn't collect all the CO2 they should have.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Too much acid. If there's excess acid, it might cause the reaction to go faster, but I'm not sure how that would lower CO2. Unless it's causing some other issue, but I don't think that's the main problem here.

Option B: Incorrect atmospheric pressure. If the pressure was wrong, the calculations for moles using PV=nRT would be off. But the problem says the pressure was measured, so maybe it was measured wrong. But if they used the wrong value, like a higher pressure, that would make n (moles) seem higher. Wait, but if the actual pressure was higher than recorded, then using a lower pressure in calculations would result in lower n. Hmm, I'm not certain about this.

Option C: CO2 is soluble in water. Oh right, CO2 dissolves in water, especially since it's being collected over water. So some of the CO2 would dissolve, leading to a lower volume collected. If they didn't account for this, but wait the question says they corrected for vapor pressure, but maybe not for solubility. Wait, vapor pressure correction is about the water vapor in the gas. Solubility is a separate issue. So if CO2 dissolves, the volume measured would be less than actual. But wait, in their case, the volume is measured and corrected for vapor pressure. So if CO2 was lost due to solubility, their measured volume would be lower than the actual volume produced. So when they calculate moles, it would be lower than expected. That could explain low results. So option C is a possibility.

Option D: Temperature affecting reaction. The reaction rate might be affected, but the student waited until the limestone disappeared, so maybe temperature doesn't affect the amount of CO2 produced, just the rate. Unless temperature affected the solubility of CO2 in water. Higher temp might make CO2 less soluble. But the temp was 295 K, which is about room temp, so I don't know if that's the issue.

Option E: Limestone is Ca(HCO3)2. I thought limestone is primarily CaCO3. If it's HCO3, that would change the stoichiometry. Ca(HCO3)2 would produce more CO2 perhaps? Let me think: CaCO3 + 2H+ → Ca²+ + CO2↑ + H2O. If it's Ca(HCO3)2, then it's Ca(HCO3)2 + 2H+ → Ca²+ + 2HCO3^- → but wait, HCO3^- can further react with H+ → CO2 and H2O. So perhaps Ca(HCO3)2 would produce 2 moles of CO2 per mole. But in that case, if the student assumed it's CaCO3 (producing 1 mole CO2), but the actual is 2, then their expected would be higher. But the results are lower than expected, so this might not fit. Unless the student thought it's CaCO3, but the limestone actually is Ca(HCO3)2, which produces more CO2, but the student's calculation assumed CaCO3, leading to lower expected. Wait, but the question says the student's results were low. So maybe if the limestone was CaCO3, but the student thought it's something else, but I'm getting confused. Maybe this isn't the right option.

Option F: Limestone didn't fully disappear. If some remained, then not all CO2 was released, leading to lower volume. But the question states that CO2 was collected until the limestone disappeared. So maybe F isn't the issue.

Option G: Limestone isn't pure CaCO3. So if there were impurities, like other minerals that don't react or react differently, then the actual amount of CO2 produced would be less than expected. For example, if the limestone had sand or other carbonates that don't react, then the moles of CO2 would be lower. That could cause low results, making option G a good candidate.

Option H: Not enough acid. If there's not enough acid, the reaction would stop before all the limestone is dissolved. But the question says the limestone did disappear, so the acid was sufficient. So H isn't the issue.

Option I: Volume not measured correctly. If, say, the measuring device was faulty, then the volume would be wrong. But the question says the volume was measured to the nearest mL and corrected for vapor pressure. So perhaps the error is elsewhere.

Option J: Vapor pressure not correctly accounted for. If the vapor pressure was higher than accounted for, then the CO2 volume would be overestimated. For example, if they subtracted too much for vapor pressure, then the measured CO2 would be lower. Wait, wait. Let me think: when you collect gas over water, the total volume includes CO2 and water vapor. The actual volume of CO2 is (total volume) - (volume of water vapor). If the vapor pressure is high, the water contributes more. So if the student didn't correctly account for it, say they didn't subtract enough, then their measured CO2 volume would be higher. But that would lead to higher moles, not lower. Alternatively, if they overcorrected, subtracting more than necessary, then CO2 volume would be lower, leading to lower moles. So if the vapor pressure was higher than what they used, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps they used a wrong vapor pressure value. So if they didn't account for it correctly, perhaps the volume was underestimated.

Wait the question says that the volume was corrected for vapor pressure, so perhaps the correction was done incorrectly. For example, if the actual vapor pressure was higher than what they used, then the measured CO2 would be lower than actual. Let me think: suppose the true vapor pressure at that temperature is, say, 20 mmHg. If the student used 15 mmHg, then they would subtract less, making the CO2 volume appear larger. But that would lead to higher moles, which isn't the case here. Alternatively, if the student used a higher vapor pressure value than actual, they subtract more, making CO2 volume lower, leading to lower moles. So if the student overestimated the vapor pressure, they would undercount CO2. So that's a possibility.

So possible options are C, G, or J.

Now, back to the problem. The student got low results. So they collected less CO2 than expected.

Option C: CO2 is soluble. So if some CO2 dissolves in water, the volume collected is less. But wait, in the setup, they collected CO2 over water. So the collected gas includes water vapor and CO2. But the solubility of CO2 in water would mean that some CO2 dissolves, so the volume of gas collected is less than the actual volume produced. Because when CO2 is bubbled through water, some dissolves, reducing the volume. So if they measured the volume as (total gas) minus (water vapor), but didn't account for the dissolved CO2, then their calculated volume would be less. So the moles would be lower. So that would explain the low results.

Option G: If the limestone wasn't pure, like it had other substances that don't produce CO2, then the moles of CO2 would be lower than expected. For example, if the limestone had silica or other minerals, those wouldn't react with acid to produce CO2. So the actual amount of CO2 would be less than what's calculated based on the mass of pure CaCO3. That would cause low results.

So now I'm considering which one is more likely. The problem says the limestone was weighed when dry. If the limestone had impurities, then the moles of CO2 would be less. But how common is that? I think in experiments, limestone is often considered pure, but in reality, it's not. So option G is a common issue.

Another angle: the student's calculation assumes that all the mass of limestone is CaCO3. If it's not, then the expected moles would be higher than actual, leading to lower results.

So, between C and G.

Wait, but in the reaction, CO2 is produced and collected. If some CO2 dissolves in water (option C), the volume measured would be less than the actual produced. So the student would report less CO2 than was actually produced. But wait, the reaction stoichiometry is based on the mass of limestone. If the limestone is impure, the expected moles (based on mass) would be higher than actual, leading to lower results. So both C and G could cause lower results.

Now, the question: why did the student get low results? Let's think about possible points of error.

If the limestone wasn't pure, then the actual CO2 produced is less, leading to lower results. But if CO2 was soluble, the volume collected is less than the actual CO2 produced, so the student's measurement is low.

Wait, but the problem states that the volume was corrected for vapor pressure. But does that include solubility? I think vapor pressure correction is about the water vapor in the collected gas, not about the solubility of the CO2 itself. So the solubility would lead to some CO2 being dissolved, which isn't accounted for in the vapor pressure correction. Hence, the volume measured would be lower than the actual CO2 produced, leading the student to calculate lower moles. So option C is a possibility.

Alternatively, if the limestone wasn't pure (option G), the moles would be lower, but the student based their expected value on the mass of impure limestone. Wait, no: the student would calculate expected moles based on the mass of the limestone they used, assuming it's pure CaCO3. If it's impure, the actual moles would be less, so the student's results (actual) would be lower than expected. So that's another possibility.

So both C and G are potential answers. But which one is more likely the reason?

In the setup, the student collected the gas until the limestone disappeared, meaning the reaction went to completion. If the limestone had other substances, like CaCO3 and something else, the something else wouldn't react. So the mass of the limestone would include both reacting and non-reacting parts. So when the student weighs it, they calculate moles based on pure CaCO3, but only part of it actually reacts, producing less CO2. So that would lead to lower results.

But if CO2 is soluble, then all the CO2 produced is accounted for in the reaction, but some is lost in the water, leading to lower volume. So the moles would be lower.

So which is more likely the reason for low results?

Hmm. Well, the question gives that the volume was corrected for vapor pressure. So they accounted for the water vapor, but not for the solubility of CO2 in water. Because, in the collection over water, the solubility would reduce the volume of CO2 collected. So in that case, the measured volume would be less than the actual, leading to lower moles.

So the possible answer could be C.

But wait, another thought: when you collect a gas over water, the total pressure is atmospheric pressure. Dalton's law applies. The pressure of CO2 is (atmospheric pressure - vapor pressure of water). So the number of moles is determined by (P_total - P_water) * V / RT.

But if some CO2 dissolves, then the volume decreases. So the collected volume is less than the volume at the gas state. So the moles calculated would be lower than actual.

So for example, suppose x moles of CO2 are produced, but some dissolve, so only y moles are collected. Then, when the student calculates using y, they get lower moles than x.

So if the student didn't account for the solubility (which isn't part of the vapor pressure correction), they would have low results. So option C is correct.

But then, what about the purity of limestone? If the limestone is impure, the actual moles would be lower. But the question states that the limestone was weighed, and CO2 collected until it disappeared. So if the limestone is impure, perhaps not all of it would react. Wait, but the question says the limestone did disappear. So if impurities were present, perhaps they didn't react but were weighed. For example, if the limestone had, say, 90% CaCO3 and 10% SiO2. The SiO2 wouldn't react. So when the student weighs it, they assume 100% CaCO3, but only 90% reacts, producing less CO2. So the expected moles would be higher than actual. But the student's calculation is based on the mass, so they expect n = mass / molar_mass, but only 0.9*mass is CaCO3, leading to 0.9n expected. So their actual result would be lower than expected.

So both C and G could cause low results.

But the question says that the limestone was dry, and the CO2 was collected until the limestone disappeared, so maybe the impurities didn't affect the reaction completion. Wait, no. If the impurities are non-reactive, like SiO2, they wouldn't dissolve. So in that case, the limestone wouldn't fully disappear because the SiO2 would remain. But the question says the limestone did disappear, implying all of it reacted. So perhaps the impurities were reactive, but that's not common. Alternatively, maybe the impurities were small enough that they were carried away or something. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the limestone sample wasn't pure CaCO3 but, say, CaCO3 with some moisture, but the limestone was weighed dry. So moisture wouldn't affect the mass. But if it was other substances, like MgCO3, which reacts differently, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: limestone is often a mixture, but the main component is CaCO3. So if the student assumed it's pure, but it's not, then the moles would be lower. But in the scenario, the limestone did disappear, so perhaps all of it reacted, meaning that the impurities, if any, also reacted. So maybe that's not the issue.

Alternatively, if the limestone had other carbonate salts, like CaCO3 and MgCO3, both would react, producing CO2. So perhaps the moles would be similar. So option G may not necessarily cause lower results.

Wait, but if the limestone had other substances that don't produce CO2, like CaO or other oxides, then those wouldn't produce CO2 when reacted with acid. But I'm not certain.

Hmm. So perhaps the more likely reason is the solubility of CO2 in water, leading to lower measured volume. So option C could be the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the vapor pressure correction was not done properly. If the vapor pressure was higher than accounted for, then the CO2 volume would be lower. For example, if the actual vapor pressure was higher, but the student used a lower value, then the calculated CO2 volume would be (total volume) - (used vapor pressure). So if the actual vapor pressure was higher, say, 30 mmHg, but the student used 20 mmHg, then the CO2 volume would be V_total - 20 instead of V_total -30. So the CO2 volume would be higher than actual. Wait, that would lead to a higher calculation, which doesn't fit the scenario.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify: the volume measured is the volume of the gas collected, which includes CO2 and water vapor. To get the volume of CO2, you subtract the volume contributed by water vapor. So if the student didn't account for the vapor pressure correctly, perhaps they added instead of subtracted, but that's unlikely. Or perhaps they used the wrong vapor pressure value.

Alternatively, if the vapor pressure was higher but they didn't account for it, then the volume of CO2 would be underestimated.

Wait, let's think numerically. Suppose the total volume collected is 200 mL. The vapor pressure at that temperature is, say, 20 mmHg. The atmospheric pressure is 760 mmHg. So the pressure of CO2 is (760-20)=740 mmHg. So the volume of CO2 is (740/760)*200 mL ≈ 194.7 mL.

But if the student didn't correct for vapor pressure, they would take 200 mL as CO2 volume, leading to higher moles. So that's not the case here.

Alternatively, if the student used a vapor pressure value that was too high, say 30 mmHg, then CO2 volume would be (760-30)/760 * 200 = (730/760)*200 ≈ 191.8 mL. But if the actual vapor pressure was 20, the correct CO2 volume is higher (194.7 mL). So the student's calculation would be lower than actual, leading to lower moles. So that could cause low results.

So if the student used a higher vapor pressure than actual, their calculated CO2 volume would be lower. But why would they do that? Because vapor pressure depends on temperature. If the student used a vapor pressure value for a lower temperature than the actual, that would mean using a lower vapor pressure. Wait, no. Wait, vapor pressure increases with temperature. So if the actual temperature was higher than what the student used to get the vapor pressure, the actual vapor pressure would be higher. So if the student used a lower vapor pressure (for a lower temp), then their calculation would be CO2 volume = V_total - (lower vapor pressure), which would be higher than actual. Wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong.

Let me think again. The correct way is to take the vapor pressure at the actual temperature. Suppose the actual temperature is higher than what the student used. Then, the actual vapor pressure is higher. If the student used a lower vapor pressure value, then when they calculate CO2 volume as V_total * (P_total - P_water) / P_total.

Wait, perhaps using the ideal gas equation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the student used the wrong vapor pressure, say, lower than actual, then the CO2 volume would be calculated as higher than actual. Let's say actual vapor pressure is 20 mmHg, but the student used 15 mmHg. So the calculated CO2 volume would be (P_total - 15)/P_total * V_total, which is higher than
