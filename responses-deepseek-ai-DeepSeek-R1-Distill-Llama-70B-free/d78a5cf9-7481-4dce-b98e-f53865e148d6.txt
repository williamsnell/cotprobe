Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the wavelength of light required to ionize sodium atoms. The ionization potential given is 8.17 × 10^-19 J. Hmm, ionization potential is the energy needed to remove an electron from an atom, right?

So I remember that when light provides enough energy to ionize an atom, that energy corresponds to a specific wavelength. Oh right, this relates to the photoelectric effect. The basic idea is that the energy of the incoming photon has to be at least equal to the ionization energy to eject the electron.

I think the formula I need is E = hc/λ. E is the energy, h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. So I need to rearrange this to solve for λ. That would be λ = hc/E.

Wait, what are the values for h and c again? Planck's constant, h, is approximately 6.626 × 10^-34 J·s. And the speed of light, c, is about 3.0 × 10^8 m/s. Oh wait, but the wavelength is usually in angstroms here, and the options are in Å, which is 1e-10 meters. So I need to make sure the units match up.

So plugging in the numbers: E is 8.17e-19 J. Let me calculate hc first. h times c is 6.626e-34 * 3e8. Let me compute that.

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. So hc is about 1.988e-25 J·m.

Now, λ = hc/E. So E is 8.17e-19 J. Plugging in, λ = (1.988e-25) / (8.17e-19) = let's compute that.

Dividing 1.988e-25 by 8.17e-19. Let me think. 1.988 /8.17 is approximately 0.243. Then the exponents: 1e-25 divided by 1e-19 is 1e-6. Wait, wait, no, because when you divide 1e-25 by 1e-19, it's 1e-6. So 0.243e-6 meters? Oh wait, because 1e-25 / 1e-19 is 1e-6. So 0.243e-6 meters is the same as 2.43e-7 meters. Wait, no, wait. 0.243e-6 is 2.43 ×10^-7 meters.

But wait, 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters. So to convert meters to angstroms, I multiply by 1e10. So 2.43e-7 meters is 2.43e-7 * 1e10 = 2.43e3 Å. Wait, wait, that can't be right because 1e-10 is an angstrom. So 2.43e-7 meters is 2430 Å because 1e-7 is 10 Å. Wait, 1e-7 m is 1e3 Å (because 1e-10 m is 1 Å). So 2.43e-7 m is 2430 Å. So λ is approximately 2430 angstroms.

Looking at the options, option C is 2430 Å. But wait, I need to think again because sometimes the ionization potential is given in terms of eV, but here it's given in Joules. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Let me double-check the calculation. E = 8.17e-19 J. hc is 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. So lambda is 1.9878e-25 / 8.17e-19. Let me compute that division more accurately.

Let me write it as (1.9878 / 8.17) × 10^(-25 + 19) = ?

1.9878 ÷8.17 ≈ 0.243. And 10^(-25+19) is 10^-6. So 0.243e-6 meters is 2430 Å. So that's correct.

So the correct answer would be option C:2430 Å.

To determine the wavelength of light required for the ionization of sodium atoms, we use the relationship between energy and wavelength:  

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \quad \text{or rearranged as} \quad \lambda = \frac{hc}{E}
\]

Here:  
- \(E = 8.17 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\) (ionization potential of sodium)  
- \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) (Planck's constant)  
- \(c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\) (speed of light)  

First, calculate \(hc\):  
\[
hc = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \times (3.0 \times 10^8) = 1.9878 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J·m}
\]

Next, solve for \(\lambda\):  
\[
\lambda = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{8.17 \times 10^{-19}}
\]

Perform the division:  
\[
\lambda = 0.243 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} = 2.43 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}
\]

Convert meters to angstroms (\(1 \, \text{Å} = 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\)):  
\[
\lambda = 2.43 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \times 10^{10} \, \text{Å/m} = 2430 \, \text{Å}
\]

Thus, the wavelength of light required to ionize sodium atoms is **2430 Å**, which corresponds to option **C**.
