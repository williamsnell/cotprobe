Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about what to do when universal screening data shows that very few students are meeting school competencies. Hmm. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I need to understand what universal screening means. From what I remember, universal screening is a process where all students are assessed to identify those who might be at risk of not meeting certain academic standards. So if the data shows that very few are succeeding, the school needs to take some action.

The question is asking which of the options must be done. So it's a requirement, not just a suggestion. Let's look at each option.

Option A: Invest in more modern educational technology. That sounds like it could help, but is it a must? Maybe not. It depends on the situation. Some schools might not have the funds, and there's no guarantee that tech alone solves the problem.

Option B: Place students not meeting competencies in lower grades. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Lowering their grade level could be discouraging and might not address the root cause. Plus, it's not a common practice. I think this is probably not the correct answer.

Option C: Give students more time to develop competencies. That makes sense. If they're not meeting them yet, maybe they need an extended period or more time in the school year. But is this a must? I'm not sure. It could be a possible action, but maybe not the required one.

Option D: Hire more teachers to reduce class size. Smaller classes can help, but again, it's a resource issue. Schools might not have the budget, so this isn't necessarily a must-do action.

Option E: Contact parents for meetings. Parental involvement is important, but is it mandatory in this case? It seems like a good step, but I'm not sure if it's the required action when so few are meeting competencies.

Option F: Provide strategic or supplemental instruction. This sounds like targeted help for students who are struggling. I remember something about Response to Intervention (RTI) where students get extra support. So this might be a required step when universal screening shows many aren't meeting competencies.

Option G: Change the core program delivery. If the data shows the core instruction isn't effective for most students, then the school might need to adjust how they're teaching. This could be a necessary change because the current approach isn't working.

Option H: Lower the competency standards. That doesn't seem right. Lowering standards might mask the problem instead of solving it. It's probably not a good approach.

Option I: Evaluate students for learning disabilities. While some students might have disabilities, the question says very few are meeting competencies, which suggests a broader issue rather than individual disabilities. So this might not be the immediate step for all students.

Option J: Increase homework. More homework doesn't necessarily equate to better understanding. It could lead to frustration and isn't a proven solution for all students.

Now, thinking about what's required. If most students aren't meeting the competencies, the problem likely lies in the instruction or the core curriculum. So the school needs to look at the core program. That points to option G.

But wait, option F is about providing extra help. I think that's also a common response. So which one is correct?

In the context of universal screening, if a large number aren't meeting the benchmarks, the school must first ensure that the core instruction is effective. If it's not, then changes to the core program are necessary. Additionally, providing supplemental instruction is part of a multi-tiered system of support.

Wait, but the question says which must be done. So both G and F could be actions, but the question is phrased as "must be done". 

Looking back, I think the correct answer is F. Because when screening shows many aren't meeting competencies, the next step is to provide targeted support, which is strategic or supplemental instruction. But I'm a bit confused because G is about changing the core program, which might also be necessary.

Wait, perhaps both are correct, but the question is asking for which must be done. I think the immediate step is to provide extra help, which is option F. Changing the core program might come after if the problem persists.

Alternatively, maybe the school needs to adjust the core instruction because the current method isn't effective for most students. So G would be the must-do.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about educational policies. I recall that when assessment data shows that a significant number of students aren't meeting standards, schools are required to take certain actions, like revising their instructional strategies or providing additional support. 

In the RTI model, universal screening is the first tier. If students aren't responding, they move to tier 2, which is supplemental instruction. So in this case, since very few are meeting competencies, the school must provide that additional support, making option F correct.

But wait, if the core instruction isn't working for most, then changing it (option G) would be necessary. So now I'm torn between F and G.

The question is asking which must be done. I think both could be correct, but perhaps the question is pointing more towards the supplemental instruction as the next step after screening. So the correct answer would be F.

Wait, but the question says "must be done". So perhaps the school must change the core program because the initial instruction isn't working for most. Therefore, option G is the must-do.

I'm a bit confused, but I think the correct answer is either F or G. Let me try to recall any specific standards. In Response to Intervention, if the universal screening shows that many students are below benchmark, schools implement supplementary interventions. So that would point to F.

Wait, but the core program is the primary instruction. If it's not effective, maybe the school needs to change how they deliver it. So G would be the necessary step.

Alternatively, maybe both F and G are part of the process, but the question is which must be done. I'm not entirely certain, but I think the correct answer is F: Students who are not meeting competencies must be given strategic or supplemental instruction.

When universal screening data indicates that very few students are meeting school competencies, the school must take action to address the issue. Among the options provided, the most appropriate and required step is to provide strategic or supplemental instruction to students who are struggling. This approach aligns with educational frameworks like Response to Intervention (RTI), where targeted support is essential when a significant number of students are not meeting benchmarks. While changing the core program delivery (Option G) might also be necessary, the immediate and required action is to offer additional support to ensure students can meet the competencies.

Answer: F
