Okay, so I've got this problem about a toroidal magnetic core, and I need to find the ampere-turns required to achieve a certain magnetic flux density in the air gap. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the parameters given are:
- l_m = 20 cm (I think this is the mean length of the magnetic path)
- A_m = 2 cm² (the cross-sectional area of the core)
- l_g = 0.1 cm (the air gap length)
- μ_r = 4000 (relative permeability of the core material)
- B_g = 0.1 Wb/m² (the desired flux density in the air gap)
- A_g = 2.31 cm² (area of the air gap)

Wait, the formula I remember for magnetic circuits involves the ampere-turns (NI), which is the product of current and turns. Oh right, the equation is NI = (B_g * l_g) / (μ0) * (l_m + l_g)/(μ_r * A_m). No, wait, maybe I should think in terms of the magnetic flux in the core and the air gap.

Wait another thought: In a magnetic circuit, the total reluctance is the sum of the core's reluctance and the air gap's reluctance. The formula for reluctance is S = l/(μA), where l is the length, μ the permeability, and A the area.

So the total ampere-turns NI should equal the total magnetic flux times the total reluctance. Or wait, no, the total ampere-turns equals the total magnetomotive force (MMF), which is the sum of the MMF in the core and the air gap.

Wait, the MMF is the product of the magnetic flux density B and the length of the path, multiplied by the permeability of free space, I think. Or is it B times length divided by permeability? Let me get this right.

I remember that the MMF (which is NI) is equal to the sum of H times l for each part of the magnetic circuit. Since the core has a relative permeability μ_r, its absolute permeability is μ0*μ_r. The air gap has μ0 as its permeability.

So, the magnetic flux Φ is the same in both the core and the air gap, right? Because it's a series magnetic circuit.

Wait, the flux Φ in the core is B_m * A_m, and in the air gap it's B_g * A_g. But since the core and air gap are in series, the flux must be the same in both. So B_m * A_m = B_g * A_g.

Wait, but the problem gives me B_g, so I can find B_m. Let me compute that.

But wait, the given A_g is 2.31 cm², and A_m is 2 cm². Hmm, so Φ = B_m * A_m = B_g * A_g → B_m = (B_g * A_g) / A_m.

Let me compute that. B_g is 0.1 Wb/m². Wait, units are important. Let me make sure all units are consistent.

Wait, the area A_g is given in cm², so I need to convert that to m². 2.31 cm² is 2.31e-4 m². Similarly, A_m is 2 cm² → 2e-4 m².

So B_m = (0.1 Wb/m² * 2.31e-4 m²) / (2e-4 m²) = (0.231e-4) / (2e-4) → 0.1155 Wb/m². Wait, that's a rough calculation. Let me compute it more accurately.

0.1 * 2.31e-4 = 2.31e-5. Divided by 2e-4 m²: 2.31e-5 / 2e-4 = (2.31 / 20) = 0.1155 T. So B_m is approximately 0.1155 T.

Wait, but is this the correct approach? Because the core's permeability is much higher than that of the air gap, so most of the flux would be in the core, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the flux in the air gap is the same as in the core.

Wait, another approach: The ampere-turns NI can be found using the formula:

NI = (B_g * l_g * (l_m + l_g)) ) / (μ0 * μ_r * A_m)

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think about the magnetic circuit. The total MMF (NI) is equal to the sum of the drops in the core and the air gap.

The formula for H is H = NI / n, but wait, H is magnetic field strength, and in each section, H is different.

Wait, the magnetic field H in the core (H_m) and in the air gap (H_g) can be found. The flux in the core is B_m = μ_r * μ0 * H_m, and in the air gap, B_g = μ0 * H_g.

But since the flux is continuous, Φ = B_m * A_m = B_g * A_g.

So B_m = (B_g * A_g) / A_m.

That's what I did earlier, which gives B_m = 0.1 * 2.31e-4 / 2e-4 = 0.1155 T.

Then, H_m = B_m / (μ_r * μ0) → since B = μH, so H = B/(μ). For the core, μ = μ_r * μ0, so H_m = B_m / (μ_r μ0).

Similarly, H_g = B_g / μ0.

The total MMF is NI = H_m * l_m + H_g * l_g.

So putting it all together, let's compute each part.

Compute H_m first:

B_m = 0.1155 T
μ_r = 4000
μ0 = 4πe-7 H/m.

So H_m = 0.1155 / (4000 * 4πe-7)

Let me compute the denominator: 4000 *4πe-7 = 16000 * π * 1e-7 = 16000πe-7 = 5.0265e-3 approximately (since π≈3.1416, 16000*3.1416≈50265, 50265e-7 = 5.0265e-3).

So H_m ≈ 0.1155 / 0.0050265 ≈ approx 23 (exactly, let me compute 0.1155 / 0.0050265:

0.0050265 * 23 = 0.1156, which is very close to 0.1155. So H_m ≈ 23 A/m.

Now, H_g = B_g / μ0 → 0.1 / (4πe-7) ≈ 0.1 / 1.2566e-6 ≈ 79577.47 A/m.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 4πe-7 is approximately 1.25663706e-6 H/m.

So 0.1 / 1.25663706e-6 = 100,000 / (12.5663706) ≈ 7957.747 A/m.

Wait, no: 0.1 is 1e-1, 1e-1 / 1.2566e-6 = (1e-1) / (1.2566e-6) )= (1/(1.2566)) * 1e5 → approximately 0.79577 * 1e5 → 79577 A/m.

Wait, that's a huge number. Makes sense because air gaps require a lot of H.

Now, compute the MMF contributions:

MMF_core = H_m * l_m = 23 A/m * 0.2 m = 4.6 A.

Wait, wait, l_m is 20 cm, which is 0.2 m.

MMF_gap = H_g * l_g = 79577 A/m * 0.1 cm → wait, 0.1 cm is 0.001 m.

So 79577 * 0.001 = 79.577 A.

So total MMF is 4.6 + 79.577 ≈ 84.177 A.

So NI ≈ 84.177 ampere-turns.

Looking at the options, option I is 84.1, which is very close. So the answer should be I.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations in case I made a mistake.

Wait, when I calculated B_m:

A_g = (2+0.1)(1+0.1) cm² = 2.1 * 1.1 = 2.31 cm². Correct.

A_m is 2 cm². So B_m = (0.1 Wb/m²) * (2.31e-4 m²) / (2e-4 m²) → 0.1 * 2.31e-4 / 2e-4 = (0.1 * 2.31) / 2 → 0.231 / 2 = 0.1155 T. Correct.

H_m = 0.1155 / (4000 * 4πe-7) → 4000 *4πe-7 is 1.6e-3 * π → approx 5.0265e-3. 0.1155 / 0.0050265 ≈ 23, correct.

H_g = 0.1 / (4πe-7) → 0.1 / 1.2566e-6 ≈ 79577 A/m. Correct.

MMF: 23 * 0.2 = 4.6, 79577 * 0.001 = ~79.58. Sum is ~84.18, so 84.1 is the closest option, which is option I.

To determine the ampere-turns \( N_I \) required to realize a magnetic flux density \( B_g = 0.1 \, \text{Wb/m}^2 \) in the air gap, we analyze the magnetic circuit. The total magnetomotive force (MMF) is the sum of the contributions from the magnetic core and the air gap:

\[
N_I = H_m \cdot l_m + H_g \cdot l_g
\]

### Step 1: Magnetic flux in the core and air gap
The magnetic flux \( \Phi \) is continuous in the magnetic circuit, so:

\[
\Phi = B_m \cdot A_m = B_g \cdot A_g
\]

Given:
- \( A_g = 2.31 \, \text{cm}^2 = 2.31 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m}^2 \),
- \( A_m = 2 \, \text{cm}^2 = 2 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m}^2 \),
- \( B_g = 0.1 \, \text{Wb/m}^2 \),

we calculate \( B_m \) as:

\[
B_m = \frac{B_g \cdot A_g}{A_m} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 2.31 \times 10^{-4}}{2 \times 10^{-4}} = 0.1155 \, \text{T}.
\]

### Step 2: Magnetic field strength in the core and air gap
The magnetic field strength \( H \) is related to \( B \) by \( B = \mu H \), where \( \mu = \mu_r \mu_0 \) for the core and \( \mu = \mu_0 \) for the air gap.

1. **Core**:
   \[
   H_m = \frac{B_m}{\mu_r \mu_0} = \frac{0.1155}{4000 \cdot 4\pi \times 10^{-7}}.
   \]
   Compute \( \mu_r \mu_0 = 4000 \cdot 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \approx 5.0265 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{H/m} \):
   \[
   H_m = \frac{0.1155}{5.0265 \times 10^{-3}} \approx 23 \, \text{A/m}.
   \]

2. **Air gap**:
   \[
   H_g = \frac{B_g}{\mu_0} = \frac{0.1}{4\pi \times 10^{-7}}.
   \]
   Compute \( \mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \approx 1.2566 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{H/m} \):
   \[
   H_g = \frac{0.1}{1.2566 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 79577 \, \text{A/m}.
   \]

### Step 3: Total MMF
The total MMF is:

\[
N_I = H_m \cdot l_m + H_g \cdot l_g,
\]
where:
- \( l_m = 20 \, \text{cm} = 0.2 \, \text{m} \),
- \( l_g = 0.1 \, \text{cm} = 0.001 \, \text{m} \).

Substitute the values:
\[
N_I = (23 \cdot 0.2) + (79577 \cdot 0.001) = 4.6 + 79.577 \approx 84.177 \, \text{A}.
\]

### Final Answer
The closest option to \( N_I = 84.177 \, \text{A} \) is **84.1 ampere-turns**, which corresponds to **option I**.
