Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again: What's the slope of the line that passes through the points (5,4) and (-2,3)? The options are A through J, with numbers like 0.1, 0.25, up to 1.5.

Hmm, slope. I remember slope is about steepness, right? And the formula for slope when given two points is something like (y2 - y1) divided by (x2 - x1). Oh wait, yes, the change in y over change in x. So I need to pick which point is which. Let me assign them as (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Does it matter which one I choose as which? I think it doesn't because subtraction is involved, but I should be careful with the signs.

So the two points are (5,4) and (-2,3). Let me take the first point as (x1, y1) and the second as (x2, y2). So x1 is 5, y1 is 4. x2 is -2, y2 is 3.

Wait, no, maybe I should make sure that I'm consistent. Slope formula is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1). So let me plug in the values. y2 is 3, y1 is 4. So 3 minus 4 is -1. x2 is -2, x1 is 5. So -2 minus 5 is -7. So the slope is (-1)/(-7), which is positive 1/7.

Wait, 1/7 is approximately 0.142857... Looking at the options, I see option G is 0.14 and I is 0.33. Hmm, 0.14 is closer to 1/7. Because 1/7 is about 0.142857, which is roughly 0.14 when rounded to two decimal places. So the slope should be 1/7, which is approximately 0.14, so option G.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculation. Maybe I mixed up the points. What if I reverse them? Let me try that. If I take (x1, y1) as (-2,3) and (x2, y2) as (5,4). So y2 - y1 is 4-3=1. x2 - x1 is 5 - (-2) = 7. So slope is 1/7, same as before. Yep, same result. So definitely 1/7.

Looking at the options again, option G is 0.14. That's two decimal places, so 0.14. So the correct answer should be option G.

I think that's it. No other option matches 1/7. Let me just check if I didn't make a mistake in the formula. Slope is rise over run, which is change in y over change in x. So yes, (3-4)/(-2-5) = (-1)/(-7)=1/7. Or (4-3)/(5 - (-2))=1/7. Both ways, same answer.

So the answer is G.

The slope of the line passing through the points (5, 4) and (-2, 3) is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{slope} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
\]

Assigning the points as \((x_1, y_1) = (5, 4)\) and \((x_2, y_2) = (-2, 3)\), we find:

\[
\text{slope} = \frac{3 - 4}{-2 - 5} = \frac{-1}{-7} = \frac{1}{7} \approx 0.14
\]

This matches option G. Reversing the points yields the same result:

\[
\text{slope} = \frac{4 - 3}{5 - (-2)} = \frac{1}{7} \approx 0.14
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

G: 0.14

Answer: G
