Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the volume of a gas under certain conditions. Let's see, the problem gives me the temperature, pressure, and the compression factor. Hmm, I remember that the compression factor is Z, which relates the real gas behavior to the ideal gas law.

The data given is: temperature is 300 K, pressure is 20 atm, and the compression factor Z is 0.86. The amount of gas is 8.2 mmol. I need to find the volume they occupy.

Wait, the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. But since it's not an ideal gas, we use the compression factor Z. So the equation becomes PV = ZnRT, right? Or wait, maybe it's Z = PV/(nRT), so rearranging that would give PV = Z n R T. So yeah, PV = Z n R T. So I can solve for V.

Let me write down what I know:
Z = 0.86
n = 8.2 mmol. Oh wait, I need to convert that to moles because R is usually in terms of moles. 8.2 mmol is 8.2e-3 mol.

R is the gas constant. I think I need to use the right units. Let me recall the units for R. Common values are 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) or 8.314 J/(mol·K). Since the pressure is in atm, maybe using R as 0.0821 would be easier because the units would match better.

So R = 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

Temperature T is 300 K.

Pressure P is 20 atm.

So putting it into the equation:

V = (Z * n * R * T) / P

Plugging the numbers in:

V = (0.86 * 8.2e-3 mol * 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) * 300 K) / 20 atm.

Let me compute the numerator first.

Calculate 0.86 * 8.2e-3.

0.86 * 8.2 is approximately 7.052. So 0.86 *8.2e-3 = 7.052e-3.

Next, multiply by 0.0821:

7.052e-3 * 0.0821 = let's see. 7e-3 is 0.007, 0.007 *0.0821 is about 0.0005747. But more accurately, 7.052e-3 * 0.0821 = 0.0005784 (since 7 * 0.0821 is 0.575, so 7.052 gives a bit more).

Then multiply by 300 K:

0.0005784 * 300 = 0.17352.

Now divide by 20 atm:

0.17352 / 20 = 0.008676 liters.

Wait, 0.008676 liters is the same as 8.676 cm³ because 1 liter is 1000 cm³. So 0.008676 L = 8.676 cm³. But wait, looking at the options, I don't see 8.676. Let me check my calculations again to see if I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me recalculate each step more carefully.

First, Z = 0.86.

n =8.2 mmol = 0.0082 mol.

R =0.0821 L atm/mol K.

T=300 K.

P=20 atm.

So V = (Z * n * R * T) / P.

Compute numerator: Z * n * R * T.

Z * n = 0.86 * 0.0082 = Let's compute that.

0.86 * 0.008 = 0.00688, and 0.86 *0.0002=0.000172. So total is 0.00688 + 0.000172 = 0.007052.

Multiply by R: 0.007052 * 0.0821.

So 0.007 * 0.0821 is 0.0005747, 0.000052 * 0.0821 is 0.000004265. So total is approximately 0.0005747 + 0.000004265 = 0.000578965.

Multiply by T=300: 0.000578965 * 300 = 0.1736895.

Divide by P=20: 0.1736895 / 20 = 0.008684475 liters.

Convert to cm³: 0.008684475 * 1000 = 8.684475 cm³.

Looking at the options, the closest is option H: 8.7 cm³.

Wait, but the options don't have H as 8.7? Let me check the options again.

Options:

H: 8.7 cm³.

Yes, option H is 8.7 cm³.

But wait, let me double-check all steps to make sure I didn't make an error.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe I should have converted mmol to mol correctly. 8.2 mmol is 0.0082 mol, right? Yes.

R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), correct.

Calculations:

0.86 * 0.0082 = 0.007052.

0.007052 * 0.0821 = let's compute 7052e-6 *0.0821.

Wait 7052e-6 is 0.007052.

0.007052 *0.0821 = (0.007 *0.0821) + (0.000052 *0.0821).

0.007 * 0.0821 = 0.0005747.

0.000052 *0.0821 = approximately 0.0000042652.

Adding together: 0.0005747 +0.0000042652 ≈ 0.000578965 L·atm.

Multiply by 300 K: 0.000578965 *300 =0.1736895 L·atm.

Divide by 20 atm: 0.1736895 /20 = 0.008684475 L.

Convert to cm³: 0.008684475 L *1000 mL/L = 8.684475 cm³.

So approximately 8.68 cm³, which is about 8.7 cm³.

So the correct answer would be H: 8.7 cm³.

But wait, looking back at the options provided, option H is 8.7 cm³.

Hmm, but wait the options given in the question are:

Options A through J, with H being 8.7 cm³.

So the correct answer is H.

To calculate the volume occupied by 8.2 mmol of a gas under the given conditions, we use the relationship derived from the ideal gas law modified for real gas behavior:

\[
PV = Z n R T \quad \Rightarrow \quad V = \frac{Z n R T}{P}
\]

### Given Data:
- **Compression factor**: \( Z = 0.86 \)
- **Amount of gas**: \( n = 8.2 \, \text{mmol} = 8.2 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{mol} \)
- **Gas constant**: \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \)
- **Temperature**: \( T = 300 \, \text{K} \)
- **Pressure**: \( P = 20 \, \text{atm} \)

### Calculation:
1. Compute the numerator:
   \[
   Z \cdot n \cdot R \cdot T = 0.86 \cdot (8.2 \times 10^{-3}) \cdot 0.0821 \cdot 300
   \]
   - \( Z \cdot n = 0.86 \cdot 8.2 \times 10^{-3} = 0.007052 \)
   - \( 0.007052 \cdot 0.0821 = 0.000578965 \)
   - \( 0.000578965 \cdot 300 = 0.1736895 \, \text{L·atm} \)

2. Divide by \( P \):
   \[
   V = \frac{0.1736895}{20} = 0.008684475 \, \text{L}
   \]

3. Convert to \( \text{cm}^3 \):
   \[
   V = 0.008684475 \, \text{L} \cdot 1000 = 8.684475 \, \text{cm}^3
   \]

### Final Answer:
The calculated volume is approximately \( 8.7 \, \text{cm}^3 \), which matches option **H**.
