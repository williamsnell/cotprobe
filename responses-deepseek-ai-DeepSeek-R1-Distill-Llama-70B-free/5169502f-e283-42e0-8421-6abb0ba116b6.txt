Question:

A man died in 1985. His will devised his estate in a Midwestern state to his son and daughter "to share and share alike as tenants in common. "At the time of their father's death, the daughter lived in a different part of the Midwestern state (in which the estate was located) while the son resided in a state in the Southwest. After the funeral, the daughter returned to her own residence, but the son decided to occupy the estate. He put his name on the mailbox and has paid the taxes and maintenance expenses. The daughter has been generally aware of this, but because she cared little about the estate, the daughter has never pressed her brother about the property. Since 1985, the daughter has not paid any rent or other compensation to her brother, nor has he requested such payment. In January 2010, a series of disputes arose between the son and daughter for the first time concerning their respective rights to the estate. The state in which the property is located recognizes the usual common law types of cotenancies and there is no applicable legislation on the subject. Now, the son claims the entire fee simple absolute title to the estate and brings an action against his sister to quiet title in himself. If the Midwestern states in which the property is located has an ordinary 20-year adverse possession statute, judgment should be for whom?

Options:

A: The son, because he has paid the taxes and maintenance expenses since 1985.
B: The son, because the acts of the parties indicate the sister's intention to renounce her ownership rights to the estate.
C: The daughter, because there is no evidence that her brother has performed sufficient acts to constitute an ouster.
D: The daughter, because the brother did not take any legal action to claim the property until 2010.
E: Both, because they were given the estate "to share and share alike as tenants in common."
F: The son, because during the past 25 years, the son has exercised the type of occupancy ordinarily considered sufficient to satisfy adverse possession requirements.
G: The daughter, because the brother did not request any rent or other compensation for the past 25 years.
H: The son, because the daughter has not shown any interest in the property.
I: The daughter, because one cotenant cannot acquire title by adverse possession against another.
J: The son, because he has lived in the property for more than 20 years.

Okay, I've got this legal question in front of me about adverse possession and cotenancy. Hmm, I need to figure out who gets the property after all these years. Let me start by breaking down the problem.

So, the man died in 1985 and left his estate to his son and daughter as tenants in common. That means they each own an undivided half-interest in the property. At the time, the daughter lived elsewhere in the same state, and the son lived in the Southwest. After the funeral, the daughter went back to her place, but the son decided to live in the estate. He put his name on the mailbox, paid the taxes, and handled maintenance. The daughter knew about this but didn't care much, so she didn't press her brother about it. She hasn't paid rent or anything, and he hasn't asked for any. 

Then, in 2010, they had their first disputes about their rights. The state has a 20-year adverse possession statute. The son is suing to quiet title, claiming the entire estate. The question is, who wins?

I remember that adverse possession requires certain elements: open and notorious use, exclusive, hostile, continuous, and actual for the statutory period. But when it comes to cotenancy, I think the rules are different because cotenants have rights to the entire property. So, one cotenant can't just take the whole property through adverse possession unless there's an ouster.

Wait, what's ouster? I think it's when one cotenant excludes the others with the intent to do so. Without an ouster, the possession isn't adverse because each has a right to the property. So, if the son just used the property and the daughter didn't object, that might not be enough.

In this case, the son started living there, paid taxes, but didn't ask for rent. The daughter didn't pay any, but she also didn't try to take possession. They didn't have any disputes until 2010, so maybe the son didn't do anything hostile towards her ownership.

I think the key point is whether the son's actions constituted an ouster. Did he do something to exclude her? He changed the mailbox, but that's not necessarily excluding her. If he didn't take any action to prevent her from coming back or claiming her interest, then there's no ouster. Without ouster, the time he spent there doesn't count against her because their possession is considered permissive as cotenants.

So, even though he's been there for 25 years, which is more than the 20-year statute, it doesn't matter because he didn't have hostile possession. Therefore, he can't claim adverse possession against her.

Looking at the options:

A: Son because he paid taxes. But paying taxes alone doesn't necessarily show adverse possession, especially without ouster.

B: Son because sister intended to renounce. But she didn't do anything to show that, just didn't press the issue.

C: Daughter because no ouster. That seems correct because without ouster, adverse possession doesn't apply.

D: Daughter because he waited too long. No, the time is within the statute, but the issue is the nature of possession.

E: Both, but they're tenants in common, but the issue is whether son can take the whole through adverse possession.

F: Son because occupancy sufficient. But as a cotenant, occupancy isn't enough without ouster.

G: Daughter because no rent. But not paying rent isn't the main issue; it's about ouster.

H: Son because sister didn't show interest. But she owns the property; her interest is established.

I: Daughter because one cotenant can't get title by adverse possession against another. Wait, isn't that the case? Because cotenancy implies a unity of possession, so possession by one is possession by all. So without ouster, there's no adverse possession.

J: Son because over 20 years. But again, without ouster, the time doesn't count.

So, the correct answer is either C or I. Let me think again. The general rule is that one cotenant cannot acquire title by adverse possession against another unless there's an ouster. So in this case, since there's no evidence of ouster, the daughter still owns her share, and the son can't take it through adverse possession.

So, the judgment should be for the daughter. Looking back at the options, option C says there's no sufficient acts of ouster. Option I states that one cotenant can't acquire title by adverse possession against another.

Wait, option I is a statement of the general rule. So if that rule applies, then the son can't win, so the daughter would win. So option I is the reason.

But wait, some sources might say that a cotenant can acquire through adverse possession if they exclusionary acts (ouster) for the statutory period. Since here, the son didn't exclude her, the daughter retains her interest.

So, the correct answer seems to be option C or I.

Wait, the options are:

C: Daughter, no evidence of ouster.

I: Daughter, one cotenant can't acquire title by adverse possession against another.

Which is correct? Because I seems to state the general rule, but perhaps in some jurisdictions, cotenants can acquire through adverse possession if they meet the requirements, including ouster.

In this case, the facts don't show an ouster, so even if the rule allows it with ouster, without it, it's not possible. So the daughter wins because there's no ouster (option C) or because cotenants can't do it (option I).

Wait, but the general rule is that without ouster, there's no adverse possession. So option I is correct in stating that one cotenant can't acquire title against another. So the judgment would be for the daughter because of that rule. So option I is the reason.

But looking at the options, option C says "no evidence of sufficient acts to constitute an ouster." So that's a more specific reason, whereas option I is a general rule.

In real property law, the general rule is that a cotenant cannot acquire title by adverse possession against another cotenant unless there's an ouster. So if there's no ouster, the sister still has her interest. Therefore, the correct answer is option C or I.

But wait, in some jurisdictions, a cotenant can acquire through adverse possession if they treat the property as their own to the exclusion of others, even without explicit ouster. But I think that's a minority view. The majority requires an ouster.

In this problem, the sister didn't do anything to assert her rights, but the brother didn't take any actions to exclude her either. So without an ouster, the sister's interest remains.

So, the answer should be option C or I. But which one is correct?

Looking back at the options:

Option I: "The daughter, because one cotenant cannot acquire title by adverse possession against another."

Option C: "The daughter, because there is no evidence that her brother has performed sufficient acts to constitute an ouster."

Which is the correct reason? The fact pattern doesn't show an ouster, so the sister's interest isn't affected. So the judgment is for the daughter because no ouster. So option C.

Wait, but option I is a more general statement, but the reasoning is correct as well. So which one applies here?

I think the better answer is option I because the key point is that as cotenants, one cannot adversely possess against the other without ouster, and the facts don't show ouster. But according to the options, the answer that aligns with the rule is option C.

No, wait. The options are:

A. Son: paid taxes.

B. Son: sister's intent to renounce.

C. Daughter: no ouster.

D. Daughter: brother didn't act until 2010.

E. Both: tenants in common.

F. Son: 25 years occupancy.

G. Daughter: no rent.

H. Son: sister no interest.

I. Daughter: cotenants can't have adverse possession.

J. Son: over 20 years.

So, the correct reasoning is that without ouster, a cotenant can't claim adverse possession. So the daughter wins because there's no ouster (option C), or because the general rule applies (option I).

But which option is correct? In the absence of ouster, the sister's rights remain, so the judgment is for the daughter. So option C is correct.

Wait, but maybe the sister didn't abandon her interest. So the answer is option C.

But I'm a bit confused because I thought the general rule is that cotenants can't adversely possess each other. So option I would apply.

Wait, let me think again. The common law rule is that a cotenant cannot acquire title by adverse possession against another cotenant unless there's an ouster. So without ouster, the sister retains her interest. So the correct reason is that there was no ouster (option C), but the general rule is option I.

So which option is the correct answer? The question is about whether the son can claim adverse possession. Since he can't without ouster, the daughter wins. So the answer is either C or I.

Wait, but let me look up the rule. In cotenancy, each cotenant has an equal right to possession. So if one cotenant is in possession, it's presumed to be on behalf of all. To establish adverse possession, the possessor must show that they excluded the other cotenants with the intent to do so (ouster). Without that, the possession is not adverse.

In this case, the son didn't exclude the sister; she just didn't care. So no ouster. Therefore, option C is correct because there's no evidence of ouster.

So the judgment is for the daughter because there's no ouster.

Alternatively, option I is also correct because it's the general rule, but the specific reason here is the lack of ouster.

Hmm, but the option I says "one cotenant cannot acquire title by adverse possession against another." Which is the general rule. So if that's the case, then it's correct. But I think that's not entirely accurate because some jurisdictions do allow it with ouster.

Wait, no. The majority rule is that a cotenant cannot acquire title through adverse possession unless there's an ouster. So in the absence of ouster, the sister's interest remains.

So the correct answer is option C, because there's no ouster, making the son's possession not adverse.

Alternatively, option I is correct because it's the general rule that one cotenant cannot acquire through adverse possession against another.

Wait, the question says the state recognizes the usual common-law types of cotenancies, so probably the majority rule applies.

So the judgment should be for the daughter because without ouster, the son's possession isn't adverse. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

Wait, but option I is a more general statement. Let me see the options again.

Option I: "The daughter, because one cotenant cannot acquire title by adverse possession against another." So that's the general rule, but in some cases, it's possible with ouster. So the correct answer would be option I, but in this specific situation, the reason is the lack of ouster, so option C.

Wait, but the question is about who wins, not the reasoning. So if the general rule applies, then option I is correct. But if the specific reason is the lack of ouster, option C is correct.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think of what the bar exam would expect. The key issue is that cotenants can't adversely possess each other without ouster. So the answer would be option C because there's no ouster, making the possession not adverse. Therefore, the daughter retains her interest.

Alternatively, some might think that option I is correct because it's the general rule. But I think the more precise answer is option C.

Wait, but let me look at the elements of adverse possession. For a cotenant, the possession must be hostile, which requires ouster. Without that, it's not hostile.

So, the son's possession wasn't hostile because he didn't oust the sister. Therefore, the daughter still has her share. So option C is correct.

So, after all that, I think the correct answer is option C: The daughter, because there's no evidence of ouster.

The question revolves around whether the son can acquire full ownership of the estate through adverse possession after occupying it for over 25 years, while the daughter, as a cotenant, retained her interest but did not actively assert it. The key legal issue is whether the son's actions constitute adverse possession under the applicable law.

Adverse possession requires the following elements: open and notorious use, exclusivity, hostility, continuity, and actual possession for the statutory period (20 years in this case). However, in the context of cotenancy, the general rule is that one cotenant cannot acquire title by adverse possession against another unless there is an "ouster." An ouster occurs when one cotenant excludes the others with the intent to do so. Without an ouster, the possession by one cotenant is presumed to be on behalf of all cotenants, and thus, the possession is not adverse.

In this case, the son lived in the estate, paid taxes, and maintained the property, but there is no evidence that he took any actions to exclude the daughter or assert sole ownership. The daughter's passive disinterest in the property does not constitute abandonment or relinquishment of her ownership rights. Since there is no evidence of an ouster, the son's possession cannot be considered hostile or adverse. Therefore, the daughter retains her interest as a tenant in common.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, D, E, F, G, H, J**: These options are incorrect because they either misapply the law of adverse possession or fail to account for the cotenancy relationship and the requirement of ouster.
- **C**: Correct. The daughter retains her interest because there is no evidence that the son performed sufficient acts to constitute an ouster, which is necessary for adverse possession in a cotenancy.
- **I**: While this option correctly states the general rule that one cotenant cannot acquire title by adverse possession against another, it does not specifically address the absence of ouster in this case. Option C provides a more precise reason tailored to the facts.

The best answer is **C**, as it directly addresses the lack of ouster, which is the critical factor in this case.

Answer: C
