Okay, so I've got this accounting problem here about corporation XY's financials. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question gives me a bunch of figures for the year 197X. Sales are $3,000,000. Then there are various expenses and other items: cost of goods sold is $1,500,000, administrative expenses $300,000, depreciation $800,000, and all other expenses $100,000. Retained earnings are $100,000, and the tax rate is 48%. Then they ask how much dividend is declared. Then, they also ask what it would be if the tax rate fell to 45%. The options are from A to J, each with two numbers.

Hmm, okay, so I think I need to calculate the net income first because that will determine the dividends. But wait, I remember that dividends are declared from the net income after taxes. But I'm not entirely sure how retained earnings play into this.

Let me jot down the figures:

Sales: $3,000,000
Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): $1,500,000
Administrative Expenses: $300,000
Depreciation: $800,000
Other Expenses: $100,000
Retained Earnings: $100,000
Tax Rate: 48% (then 45%)

So, the first step is to calculate the income before taxes. That would be sales minus all the expenses. Let me list the expenses:

COGS is definitely an expense. Administrative expenses too. Depreciation is a non-cash expense but still an expense. Other expenses as well. So total expenses would be COGS + Admin + Depreciation + Other.

Wait, so 1,500,000 + 300,000 + 800,000 + 100,000. Let me add that up.

1,500k + 300k is 1,800k. Plus 800k is 2,600k. Plus 100k makes 2,700,000.

So, total expenses are $2,700,000.

So, income before taxes (EBIT) is Sales - Expenses: 3,000,000 - 2,700,000 = $300,000.

Wait, that seems low. Let me double-check. Oh wait, no, maybe I missed something. 3 million minus 2.7 million is indeed 300k. Okay, moving on.

Now, taxes are calculated on this EBIT. The tax rate is 48%, so taxes would be 48% of 300,000. Let me calculate that: 0.48 * 300,000 = $144,000.

So, net income after taxes would be EBIT minus taxes: 300,000 - 144,000 = $156,000.

But wait, the problem mentions retained earnings. Retained earnings are $100,000. Do I need to add that to net income? Or is that part of the equation for dividends?

Hmm. Retained earnings are the profits reinvested in the company, right? So when a company makes a profit (net income), it can choose to retain some or all of it, or distribute some as dividends.

Wait, but how does this connect? Let me think about the formula for dividends. So, the net income after taxes is the total profit available for distribution as dividends. But the company might not pay out all of it; they might retain some. So, the amount of dividends declared would be net income minus retained earnings.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, retained earnings are the amount kept in the company, so if the company makes $156,000 after taxes, and they decide to retain $100,000, then the dividend would be 156,000 minus 100,000 = $56,000. That sounds right.

So, when the tax rate is 48%, the dividend declared is $56,000.

Now, the second part is if the tax rate falls to 45%. How does that affect the dividend?

So, let's recalculate with the new tax rate. The EBIT is still $300,000. Taxes would now be 45% of that. 0.45 * 300,000 = $135,000.

So, net income after taxes would be 300,000 - 135,000 = $165,000.

Again, the retained earnings are $100,000, so the dividend would be 165,000 - 100,000 = $65,000.

So, the two amounts are $56,000 and $65,000. Looking at the options, option C says $56,000 and $65,000. So the answer should be C.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me recheck the first part:

EBIT: 3,000,000 - (1,500,000 + 300,000 + 800,000 + 100,000) = 300,000. Correct.

Taxes at 48%: 0.48 * 300,000 = 144,000. So net income 156,000. Subtract retained earnings of 100,000, so 56,000 dividend. Correct.

At 45% tax: 0.45 * 300,000 = 135,000. Net income 165,000; minus 100k retained gives 65k. So option C is correct.

To determine the dividend declared by Corporation XY, we first calculate the net income after taxes and then subtract the retained earnings.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Expenses
The total expenses are the sum of the cost of goods sold (COGS), administrative expenses, depreciation, and other expenses:
\[
\text{Total Expenses} = \$1,500,000 + \$300,000 + \$800,000 + \$100,000 = \$2,700,000
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Income Before Taxes (EBIT)
The income before taxes is calculated as sales minus total expenses:
\[
\text{EBIT} = \$3,000,000 - \$2,700,000 = \$300,000
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Net Income After Taxes
Using the given tax rates, we calculate the taxes and then the net income after taxes.

1. **At a tax rate of 48%:**
\[
\text{Taxes} = 0.48 \times \$300,000 = \$144,000
\]
\[
\text{Net Income After Taxes} = \$300,000 - \$144,000 = \$156,000
\]

2. **At a tax rate of 45%:**
\[
\text{Taxes} = 0.45 \times \$300,000 = \$135,000
\]
\[
\text{Net Income After Taxes} = \$300,000 - \$135,000 = \$165,000
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Dividends Declared
Dividends declared are calculated by subtracting retained earnings from the net income after taxes.

1. **At a tax rate of 48%:**
\[
\text{Dividends Declared} = \$156,000 - \$100,000 = \$56,000
\]

2. **At a tax rate of 45%:**
\[
\text{Dividends Declared} = \$165,000 - \$100,000 = \$65,000
\]

### Final Answer
The dividends declared are **\$56,000** at a tax rate of 48% and **\$65,000** at a tax rate of 45%. Comparing these values to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C: $56,000 and $65,000**
