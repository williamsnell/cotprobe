Alright, so I've got this probability problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Okay, the question is about a community where some girls are blondes and some have blue eyes. I need to find out how much additional information is gained when we're told a girl with blue eyes is also a blonde. Hmm, sounds like it's about conditional probabilities and maybe information theory.

Let me jot down the given data:

- 25% of all girls are blondes. So, P(Blonde) = 0.25.
- 50% of all girls have blue eyes. So, P(Blue Eyes) = 0.5.
- 75% of all blondes have blue eyes. So, P(Blue Eyes | Blonde) = 0.75.

Wait, but what about blue-eyed girls who aren't blondes? I think I'll need to find that as well. Because the question is about a girl who has blue eyes, and we want to know if she's a blonde.

I think I should draw a probability tree or maybe a Venn diagram. But let's try to use the probabilities to find the necessary values.

First, let me find the probability that a girl is both blonde and has blue eyes. That's P(Blonde and Blue Eyes). Since 75% of blondes have blue eyes, this would be P(Blonde) * P(Blue Eyes | Blonde) = 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 or 18.75%.

Now, the total probability of a girl having blue eyes is 50%, so P(Blue Eyes) = 0.5. This includes all blue-eyed girls, whether blonde or not. So the remaining blue-eyed girls must be non-blonde. So P(Blue Eyes and not Blonde) = P(Blue Eyes) - P(Blonde and Blue Eyes) = 0.5 - 0.1875 = 0.3125 or 31.25%.

Wait, that doesn't add up because 0.1875 + 0.3125 = 0.5, which makes sense. So, now, given that a girl has blue eyes, what's the probability she's a blonde? That's P(Blonde | Blue Eyes) = P(Blonde and Blue Eyes) / P(Blue Eyes) = 0.1875 / 0.5 = 0.375 or 37.5%.

Similarly, the probability that she's a non-blonde given blue eyes is 1 - 0.375 = 0.625 or 62.5%.

But the question is about information theory. I remember that information is calculated using bits. The formula is something like Information = log2(1/P), where P is the probability. So, if the probability is lower, the information is higher because it's more surprising.

Wait, but here we're looking for the additional information when we're told she's a blonde, given that she has blue eyes. So I think we need to calculate the mutual information or maybe the conditional entropy.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the difference in uncertainty before and after knowing she's a blonde. Let's think. The initial uncertainty when we know she has blue eyes is about whether she's a blonde or not. The additional information gained is how much this reduces the uncertainty.

Wait, when we already know she has blue eyes, the probability she's a blonde is 0.375, as I calculated. So without any additional information, the probability is 0.375. But when we are told she's a blonde, that probability becomes 1. So the information gain is the difference between the initial uncertainty and the final uncertainty.

I think the formula for information gain is the entropy before minus the entropy after. Since after knowing she's a blonde, the entropy is zero (because it's certain), the information gained is just the entropy before knowing.

So the initial entropy H is for a binary variable: blonde or not, given blue eyes. So probabilities are 0.375 and 0.625.

The entropy H is calculated as H = - (p * log2 p + (1-p) * log2 (1-p)).

Plugging in p = 0.375:

H = - (0.375 * log2(0.375) + 0.625 * log2(0.625)).

Let me compute each term:

log2(0.375) is log2(3/8) = log2(3) - log2(8) ≈ 1.58496 - 3 = -1.41504 bits.

So 0.375 * (-1.41504) ≈ -0.53064. But since it's multiplied by -1 in the entropy formula, it becomes positive.

Wait, actually, let me compute each part step by step.

Compute 0.375 * log2(0.375):

0.375 is 3/8. So log2(3/8) = log2(3) - log2(8) ≈ 1.58496 - 3 = -1.41504.

So 0.375 * (-1.41504) = -0.53064.

Similarly, 0.625 is 5/8. log2(5/8) = log2(5) - log2(8) ≈ 2.32193 - 3 = -0.67807.

So 0.625 * (-0.67807) = -0.42380.

Now sum these two: (-0.53064) + (-0.42380) = -0.95444.

Then multiply by -1 to get entropy H: 0.95444 bits.

Wait, but that's the entropy before knowing. So when we are told she's a blonde, the entropy drops to zero. So the information gained is 0.95444 bits.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is phrased as "how much additional information is available if one is told that she is also a blonde." So we start with knowing she has blue eyes, and then we gain information by knowing she's a blonde.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual information between Blonde and Blue Eyes. Or maybe we're considering the information in the event that she is a blonde, given that she has blue eyes.

Wait, another approach: the amount of information can be quantified as the reduction in uncertainty. So before knowing whether she's a blonde, given blue eyes, the uncertainty is H = 0.95444 bits. After knowing she's a blonde, the uncertainty is zero. So the information gained is 0.95444 bits.

But wait, perhaps the question is asking about the mutual information between the two events. Or perhaps it's about the information content of the event "she is a blonde" given that she has blue eyes.

The information content I is usually calculated as log2(1/p), so when p is 0.375, I = log2(1/0.375) = log2(8/3) ≈ log2(2.6667) ≈ 1.415 bits.

Wait, that's about 1.415 bits. So when we are told that she is a blonde, given that she has blue eyes, the information is 1.415 bits. Looking at the options, option I is 1.415 bits.

Wait, but earlier I calculated the entropy as approximately 0.9544 bits. So which one is correct?

Let me clarify. The question is asking, when we're told that a blue-eyed girl is a blonde, how much additional information is available. So perhaps it's the information content of that specific event, not the entropy reduction.

So the probability that a blue-eyed girl is blonde is 0.375. The information content when this event occurs is log2(1/0.375) = as above, approximately 1.415 bits.

So the answer would be I: 1.415 bits.

Alternatively, sometimes the mutual information is calculated as H(B) - H(B|E), where B is blonde and E is blue eyes.

Wait, let me think about that. H(B|E) is the conditional entropy of B given E. Since B can be 0 or 1 (not blonde or blonde), given E, the entropy is H(B|E) = - (P(B|E) log P(B|E) + P(not B|E) log P(not B|E)) ) = which is the same as the 0.9544 bits I calculated earlier.

H(B) is the entropy without any condition. Since P(B) is 0.25, so H(B) = - (0.25 log 0.25 + 0.75 log 0.75 ) ≈ - (0.25*(-2) + 0.75*(-0.415)) ≈ 0.5 + 0.311 = 0.811 bits.

Wait, so mutual information I(B;E) = H(B) - H(B|E) = 0.811 - 0.9544 ≈ negative value, which doesn't make sense. Wait, that can't be right. Because mutual information is always non-negative.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Mutual information is I(B;E) = H(B) - H(B|E). But if H(B|E) is 0.9544 and H(B) is 0.811, then I(B;E) would be negative, which is impossible. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate H(B). Let's compute H(B):

P(B) = 0.25, P(not B) = 0.75.

H(B) = - [0.25 log2(0.25) + 0.75 log2(0.75) ]

Compute each term:

0.25 log2(0.25) = 0.25 * (-2) = -0.5. So 0.25 log2(0.25) is -0.5, but in the entropy formula, it's multiplied by -1, so it becomes +0.5.

0.75 log2(0.75) is 0.75 * (-0.4150) ≈ -0.3113. Multiply by -1 gives +0.3113.

So H(B) = 0.5 + 0.3113 ≈ 0.8113 bits.

H(B|E) as calculated earlier is 0.9544 bits.

So I(B;E) = 0.8113 - 0.9544 ≈ -0.1431 bits. That's negative, which can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps mutual information is H(E) - H(E|B), or maybe I got the formula wrong. Alternatively, maybe I should think differently. Because mutual information measures how much knowing one variable reduces the uncertainty of the other.

Wait, another approach: the mutual information I(B;E) = H(B) + H(E) - H(B,E).

Compute H(B,E): since P(B and E) = 0.1875, P(not B and E) = 0.3125, P(B and not E) = 0.0625 (since P(B)=0.25, and P(E|B)=0.75, so P(not E|B)=0.25. So P(B and not E) = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625), and P(not B and not E) = 1 - (0.1875 + 0.3125 + 0.0625) = 0.4375.

Wait, wait, let me recalculate:

Wait, P(B and E) = 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875.

P(E) = 0.5, so P(B|E) = 0.1875 / 0.5 = 0.375 as before.

So P(not B and E) = 0.5 - 0.1875 = 0.3125.

Now, P(not E) = 0.5, so P(B and not E) = P(B) - P(B and E) = 0.25 - 0.1875 = 0.0625.

Similarly, P(not B and not E) = P(not B) - P(not B and E) = 0.75 - 0.3125 = 0.4375.

So H(B,E) is the entropy of the joint distribution. It's the entropy for four possible outcomes, but since some are zero.

Wait, no, let me list all possibilities:

- B and E: 0.1875
- not B and E: 0.3125
- B and not E: 0.0625
- not B and not E: 0.4375

So H(B,E) = - [0.1875 log(0.1875) + 0.3125 log(0.3125) + 0.0625 log(0.0625) + 0.4375 log(0.4375) ].

Compute each term:

0.1875 = 3/16 → log2(3/16) ≈ log2(0.1875) ≈ -2.415 bits.

So 0.1875 * (-2.415) ≈ -0.4531. Multiply by -1: +0.4531.

0.3125 = 5/16 → log2(5/16) ≈ log2(0.3125) ≈ -1.678 bits.

0.3125 * (-1.678) ≈ -0.524. Multiply by -1: +0.524.

0.0625 = 1/16 → log2(1/16) = -4 → 0.0625 * (-4) = -0.25 → +0.25.

0.4375 = 7/16 → log2(7/16) ≈ log2(0.4375) ≈ -1.23 bits.

0.4375 * (-1.23) ≈ -0.539. Multiply by -1: +0.539.

Sum all these:

0.4531 + 0.524 = 0.9771 → +0.25 → 1.2271 → +0.539 → 1.7661.

So H(B,E) ≈ 1.7661 bits.

Now, H(B) ≈ 0.8113 bits, H(E) is P(E)=0.5, so H(E)=1 bit.

So mutual information I(B;E) = H(B) + H(E) - H(B,E) = 0.8113 + 1 - 1.7661 ≈ 1.8113 - 1.7661 ≈ 0.0452 bits.

Wait, that's about 0.045 bits. That doesn't match any of the options. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, going back to the original question: "how much additional information is available if one is told that she is also a blonde." So given that we know she has blue eyes, and now we're told she's a blonde. So the additional information is the information that she's a blonde, given that she has blue eyes.

That would be the information content of the event P(B|E) = 0.375. So the information is log2(1/0.375) ≈ 1.415 bits. Which is option I.

Alternatively, the mutual information I(B;E) is the expected value of log(P(B|E)/P(B)).

So for each possible value of E, compute log(P(B|E)/P(B)), multiply by P(E), and sum.

Wait, let's see:

When E occurs (which happens with P(E)=0.5), P(B|E) = 0.375. So log(0.375/0.25) = log(1.5) ≈ 0.58496 bits.

When E does not occur (P(not E)=0.5), P(B|not E) = P(B and not E)/P(not E) = 0.0625 / 0.5 = 0.125. So log(0.125 / 0.25) = log(0.5) = -1 bits.

So mutual information I(B;E) = P(E) * log(P(B|E)/P(B)) + P(not E) * log(P(B|not E)/P(B)).

So that's 0.5 * log(0.375/0.25) + 0.5 * log(0.125/0.25).

Compute each term:

log(1.5) ≈ 0.58496 → 0.5 * 0.58496 ≈ 0.2925.

log(0.5) = -1 → 0.5 * (-1) = -0.5.

So sum: 0.2925 - 0.5 = -0.2075 bits. Wait, that can't be right because mutual information can't be negative. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, no, mutual information is always non-negative. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, let me recalculate:

P(B|E) = 0.375, P(B) = 0.25.

So log(P(B|E)/P(B)) = log(0.375/0.25) = log(1.5) ≈ 0.58496 bits.

P(not E) = 0.5, P(B|not E) = 0.125, P(B)=0.25.

So log(P(B|not E)/P(B)) = log(0.125/0.25) = log(0.5) = -1.

Thus, I(B;E) = 0.5 * 0.58496 + 0.5 * (-1) = 0.29248 - 0.5 = -0.20752 bits. Negative again, which is impossible. So I'm definitely making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should have used P(B and E) and P(B) P(E) in the mutual information formula. The correct formula is I(B;E) = log(P(B,E)/ (P(B) P(E)) ) for each outcome, then sum over all outcomes. But that's for each possible pair of B and E.

Alternatively, the mutual information is H(B) - H(B|E), which we saw earlier gives a negative value, which is impossible. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, perhaps H(B|E) was calculated incorrectly. Let me recalculate H(B|E).

H(B|E) is the entropy of B given E. Since given E, P(B|E) is 0.375 and P(not B|E) is 0.625.

So H(B|E) = - (0.375 log2(0.375) + 0.625 log2(0.625)).

Compute each term:

0.375 log2(0.375) ≈
