Okay, so I've got this problem about reflected power and transmission lines. Hmm, I remember from my notes that when a transmission line isn't matched properly, some of the power gets reflected. The question is about finding the ratio of reflected power to incident power when a 75-ohm load is used on a 50-ohm line. Then, if we use a 50-ohm load instead, what happens when the incident power is 50W.

Wait, so the first part is about a 75-ohm load, but the question then changes to using a 50-ohm load. I think I should focus on the second scenario because the options are about the 50-ohm case.

Oh right, when the load impedance matches the line's characteristic impedance, there's no reflection. So if the line is 50-ohm and the load is also 50-ohm, then the reflection coefficient should be zero. That means no power is reflected. So the reflected power ratio would be zero percent.

But wait, the options don't have zero. Let me check the options again. Option H says 4% reflected, but that doesn't make sense if the load matches. Wait, no, option H says 4% reflected and the source supplies all 50W. That doesn't fit because if impedance matches, reflection is zero, so all incident power is absorbed by the load.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option H says 4% reflected, which can't be right for a matched load. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a 75-ohm load on a 50-ohm line. Then, when a 50-ohm load is used, what does it signify for an incident power of 50W.

Ah, so the question is in two parts. First, find the ratio for 75-ohm, but the second part is about 50-ohm load.

But the options are all about the 50-ohm case. So perhaps the question is just about the 50-ohm scenario.

Wait, the way it's phrased is a bit confusing. The initial setup is about 75-ohm on 50-ohm line. Then, when the load is changed to 50-ohm. So perhaps the first part is given, but the question is about the second scenario.

So for the 50-ohm load, the reflection coefficient Γ is (ZL - Z0)/(ZL + Z0). So ZL is 50, Z0 is 50. So (50-50)/(50+50) = 0. So Γ is zero.

If Γ is zero, then the reflected power is zero. So the reflected power ratio is zero. So none of the options match except maybe option H, but option H says 4% reflected, which isn't zero. Wait, did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me recheck the reflection coefficient formula. Oh right, Γ is (ZL - Z0)/(ZL + Z0). So when ZL = Z0, Γ is 0. So no reflection. So all the incident power is delivered to the load.

So the reflection is zero, meaning 0% of the power is reflected. The source would supply all the incident power to the load because there's no reflection. So the source supplies 50W.

Looking at the options, which one matches this? Option H says 4% reflected, which is incorrect. Option A says 2% reflected. Hmm, none of the options say 0% reflected. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the standing wave ratio or the reflection coefficient for the first part. Oh wait, the first part is about 75-ohm on 50-ohm line. Maybe that's needed to compute the reflection, but the question is about when the load changes to 50-ohm.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio when the load is 75, and then what happens when it's 50. But the main point is the second part. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to calculate both, but the options don't directly reference both. Let me read the question again.

The question says: Find the ratio for a 75-ohm load, but suppose a 50-ohm is used instead, what does it signify for an incident power of 50W.

Wait, no. The question is in two parts but the options are about the 50-ohm case. So perhaps the correct answer is that with a 50-ohm load, reflection is zero, so no power is reflected, and the source delivers all 50W to the load.

Looking back at the options:

Option H: 4% reflected; source supplies all 50W. That doesn't make sense because if 4% is reflected, the source would have to supply more than 50W because some is reflected and some is transmitted.

Wait, no. Wait, when the load is 50-ohm, the reflection is zero, so all the incident power is delivered. So the source supplies 50W, and the load receives 50W. So which option reflects this?

Looking through the options:

Option A: 2% reflected; source supplies 49W.

Option H: 4% reflected; source supplies all 50W.

Wait, if 4% is reflected, then the source must supply more than 50W because the power delivered is split between reflected and transmitted.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the power in terms of reflection.

The formula for reflected power is Γ² times the incident power. So if Γ is 0, reflected power is zero. So all incident power is absorbed. So the source would supply 50W, and the load gets 50W.

But looking at the options, none of them say 0% reflected except perhaps option A which says 2% but the source supplies 49W.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Oh wait, the question first asks about a 75-ohm load, but then it changes to a 50-ohm load. So maybe the initial part is a setup, but the question is only about the second case.

So with ZL=50, Γ=0. So reflection is zero. So reflected power is zero, so no power is reflected. So the source just supplies the 50W to the load.

Looking at the options, which one says 0%? None. So perhaps the options are incorrect, but that's unlikely. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the first case, but the options are about the second. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the 75-ohm case, but the options are about the 50-ohm.

Wait, the question is a bit confusing. Let's read it again.

"Find the ratio of reflected power to incident power, for a 75-ohm load on a 50-ohm line. Suppose a 50-ohm load is used instead of the 75-ohm load, what does it signify for an incident power of 50W?"

So first, for 75-ohm, find the ratio. Then, if 50-ohm is used, what does it mean for 50W.

But the options are all about the 50-ohm case. So perhaps the first part is a distraction, and the question is only about the second scenario.

So for the 50-ohm load, Γ=0, so reflected power is 0. So the source supplies all 50W, and 0% is reflected.

But the options don't have 0. So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the question is actually about the 75-ohm case, and when you switch to 50-ohm, what's the new situation.

Wait, maybe I should compute the reflection coefficient for the 75-ohm case first, then for the 50-ohm case, which is zero.

But the options are about the 50-ohm case, so the correct answer should reflect 0% reflection, but none of the options do. Hmm, perhaps the question intended to ask about the 75-ohm case, and the options are about that.

Wait, the question says, what does it signify when using a 50-ohm load. So for a 50-ohm load, the reflection is zero. So the answer is that no power is reflected, so the source delivers all 50W.

Looking at the options, none say 0% reflected except perhaps H, but H says 4%, which is wrong. So perhaps the options are incorrect, but that's unlikely. I must have misread the options.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option H says 4 percent is reflected; source supplies all 50W. But that can't be right because if 4% is reflected, the source's output would need to be higher than 50W because some is reflected. So perhaps the correct answer is that when the load is 50, reflection is zero, so the source supplies 50W, and 0% is reflected.

But none of the options state that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reflection coefficient for both cases. Let me think.

First, for the 75-ohm load on 50-ohm line:

Γ = (75 - 50)/(75 +50) = 25/125 = 0.2. So reflection coefficient is 0.2.

The reflected power ratio would be |Γ|² times the incident power. So 0.04 times the incident power. So 4% of the power is reflected.

Wait, but that's for the 75-ohm case. But the question is about when the load is changed to 50-ohm. So in that case, Γ is 0. So 0% reflected.

But the options don't have 0%. So perhaps the question is only about the 75-ohm case, but the options are about the 50-ohm case.

Wait, the question's phrasing is a bit confusing. Let me read it again.

The first part asks for the ratio when the load is 75-ohm. Then, the second part says, suppose a 50-ohm load is used instead, what does it signify for an incident power of 50W.

Ah, perhaps the question is asking what happens in the 50-ohm load case. So when the load is 50-ohm, reflection is zero, so reflected power is zero.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the 75-ohm case, and when you change to 50-ohm, what's the effect.

Wait, perhaps the 50W is the incident power. So for the 75-ohm case, the reflected power is 4% of 50W, which is 2W. So the power delivered to the load is 50W - 2W = 48W. But when the load is 50-ohm, reflection is zero, so all 50W is delivered.

But the options don't have 0% reflection for the 50-ohm case. Wait, looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is option H, which says 4% reflected, but that's for the 75-ohm case.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's break it down.

The first part of the question is to find the ratio for a 75-ohm load. Then, the question changes the load to 50-ohm and asks what that signifies for an incident power of 50W.

So for the 75-ohm load, Γ is 0.2, so the reflected power is 4% of the incident power. So if the incident power is, say, P, then reflected power is 0.04P.

But when the load is changed to 50-ohm, Γ becomes 0, so reflected power is 0. So in that case, all 50W incident power is delivered to the load.

So the source supplies 50W, with 0% reflected.

But looking at the options, none have 0%. So perhaps the options are incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding which part the options are referring to.

Wait, perhaps the options are about the 75-ohm case. Let me read the options again.

Option H: 4% reflected; source supplies all 50W.

Wait, that can't be right for the 75-ohm case. Because with 4% reflected, the source would have to supply more than 50W. Because some power is reflected back, so the actual power delivered would be less.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the power delivered to the load.

The power delivered to the load when there's reflection is P_incident * (1 - Γ²). Because some is reflected, some is transmitted.

So for Γ = 0.2, the transmitted power is 1 - (0.2)^2 = 0.96 of the incident power.

So if the incident power is 50W, the load gets 48W, and 2W is reflected.

But wait, the question is about when the load is 50-ohm. So in that case, Γ is 0, so all 50W is delivered.

So the options must be considering the 50-ohm case, but none say 0% reflected. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the first part.

Wait, another approach: when the load is 50-ohm, the reflection is zero, so the source sees a matched load, so all power is delivered. So the source's output would be 50W, and the load receives 50W. So the reflected power is zero, so the ratio is zero.

Looking for the option that says 0% reflected and source supplies 50W. But none of the options have that.

Wait, looking at option H: 4% reflected; source supplies all 50W. That doesn't make sense because if 4% is reflected, the source must supply more than 50W because some is reflected and some is transmitted.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the power supplied by the source. The source's output is the sum of the incident power and the reflected power. Wait, no, the source supplies the incident power, and the reflected power is part of that.

Wait, perhaps the source's power is the incident power plus the reflected power. No, that's not right. The incident power is what's sent towards the load. The reflected power comes back, so the source would have to supply the incident power, and any reflected power is subtracted from that.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think about it in terms of voltage and current.

The incident power is P_inc = V_inc^2 / Z0.

The reflected power is P_refl = (Γ V_inc)^2 / Z0.

So the ratio is (P_refl / P_inc) = Γ².

So for Γ = 0.2 (75-ohm case), P_refl/P_inc = 0.04, so 4%.

But in the 50-ohm case, Γ=0, so P_refl=0.

So the options must be about the 50-ohm case, but none have 0%. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased in a way that the initial setup is 75-ohm, and when changed to 50-ohm, but the options are about the 75-ohm case. But the question is about the 50-ohm case.

Wait, perhaps the options are incorrect, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio when the load is 75-ohm, and then when changed to 50-ohm, what's the significance, but the options are about the 50-ohm case.

But given that none of the options have 0%, perhaps the correct answer is option H, but that's for 4% reflection, which is the 75-ohm case.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

The question is asking, when a 50-ohm load is used instead of 75-ohm, what does it signify for an incident power of 50W.

So when the load is 50-ohm, reflection is zero. So all 50W is delivered to the load. So the source supplies 50W, and 0% is reflected.

But the options don't have 0%. So perhaps the intended answer is option H, which says 4% reflected, but that's for the 75-ohm case. So perhaps the options are wrong, or I'm misinterpreting.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the 75-ohm case, and the options are about that.

Wait, let me compute the reflected power for 75-ohm.

Γ = (75-50)/(75+50) = 25/125 = 0.2.

Reflected power ratio is (0.2)^2 = 0.04, so 4%. So reflected power is 4% of incident power.

So for 50W incident, reflected power is 2W, and delivered power is 48W.

But the question is about when the load is 50-ohm, so the delivered power is 50W.

So the options should reflect that for 50-ohm, 0% is reflected, and 50W is delivered.

But none of the options say that. So perhaps the intended answer is option H, but that's incorrect because it says 4% reflected.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are about the 75-ohm case, but the question is about the 50-ohm case.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that for the 50-ohm load, 0% is reflected, so the source supplies 50W, and 0% is reflected. But none of the options match. So perhaps I should pick the closest one, but none match.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the 75-ohm case, and the options are for that. So the question might have a typo.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for which option correctly describes a 50-ohm load scenario.

Looking at the options:

Option H: 4% reflected; source supplies all 50W.

That's wrong because if 4% is reflected, the source must supply more than 50W.

Option A: 2% reflected; source supplies 49W.

Wait, 2% of 50W is 1W reflected, so 49W delivered. But that's for a different Γ.

Option H's scenario would require the source to supply more than 50W because some is reflected. For example, if P_incident is 50W, and P_reflected is 2W (4%), then the load gets 48W. But if the source's output is 50W, then P_incident is 50W, and P_reflected is 2W, so
