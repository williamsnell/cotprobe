Okay, so I have this question about plant tissues and which one is responsible for new growth. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my botany, but I'll try to think it through.

I remember that plants have different types of tissues, each with specific functions. Let me list what I know. There's meristematic tissue, which I think is related to growth. Wait, meristematic cells are like the stem cells of plants, right? They divide to produce new cells, so that must be where growth happens.

But wait, what about apical tissue? Oh, right, the apical meristems are at the tips of roots and shoots. They're responsible for primary growth, making the plant taller or the roots longer. So apical tissue is a specific type of meristematic tissue. But the question just asks in general, so maybe the broader term is needed.

Other options: sclerenchyma is a type of supportive tissue, I think. It's like the hard stuff in plant cell walls, providing structure. So that's not about growth. Ground tissue, that's the general tissue that's not vascular or dermal. It includes parenchyma, which does various functions like storage or photosynthesis, but not primarily growth.

Vascular tissue is about transport, xylem and phloem. So that's not it either. Cork tissue is part of the periderm, which is protective, like the bark. Epidermal tissue is the outer layer, protective as well. Parenchyma is the basic cells, but again, not the growth part.

So the options narrow down to meristematic or apical. The question is asking which tissue is responsible for new growth. Since meristematic is the general term for any tissue that's actively dividing, including apical, lateral, and intercalary meristems, that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, the options are A to J. Let me check: option J is Meristematic tissue, and option A is Apical tissue. So the question is about the general tissue responsible, which would be meristematic. So the answer should be J.

The question asks which tissue in plants is responsible for new growth. To determine the correct answer, it's important to evaluate the functions of each tissue:

- **Meristematic tissue (J)**: This tissue consists of actively dividing cells responsible for plant growth. It is found in areas like apical meristems (tips of roots and shoots) and intercalary meristems (along the stem). Meristematic tissue is the general term for any tissue that drives growth through cell division.

- **Apical tissue (A)**: While apical meristems are indeed responsible for primary growth, this is a specific type of meristematic tissue. The question asks for the general tissue responsible for new growth, making "meristematic tissue" the broader and more accurate term.

- **Other tissues (B to I)**: These include sclerenchyma (supportive), ground tissue (general functions), vascular tissue (transport), cork tissue (protective), parenchyma (storage/photosynthesis), and epidermal tissue (protective). None of these are primarily associated with new growth.

Thus, the correct answer is **meristematic tissue**, as it encompasses all growth-related tissues, including apical meristems. 

Answer: J
