Alright, so I've got this question to answer, and I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about management or organizational behavior, I think. It's asking about a term that refers to ensuring that one individual doesn't end up with the entire workload. 

Let me break it down. The key here is that the task is spread out so no single person is overwhelmed. So, what concepts in management relate to distributing work?

I remember terms like division of labor, which is about breaking tasks into smaller parts for efficiency. But that's more about specialization. Then there's delegation, which is when a manager assigns tasks to subordinates. But delegation doesn't necessarily balance the workload; it's more about assigning responsibility.

Workload balancing sounds familiar. It's about making sure that the work is spread evenly among team members so no one is overburdened. That makes sense. Another term I've heard is work distribution, which might be similar. But I'm not sure if that's the exact term used here. 

Wait, maybe it's workload balancing. So if the question is about preventing one person from carrying the whole task, the method would be to balance the workload across the team. So the term would be workload balancing.

Looking at the options: option B is Workload balancing. Option C is Work distribution. Hmm, are these the same? I think distribution is more about how work is assigned, but balancing is ensuring the distribution is even. So the correct term here is probably workload balancing.

Wait, another angle: work division is another term, option H. Division of labor is different, more about splitting tasks into specialized parts. So that's not it. Delegation is when you assign tasks, but again, it's not specifically about balancing the load.

So putting it all together, the answer should be B: Workload balancing.

The question asks for the term that describes ensuring no single individual bears the entire workload. The correct concept is workload balancing, which refers to distributing tasks evenly to prevent overburdening any one person. 

Answer: B
