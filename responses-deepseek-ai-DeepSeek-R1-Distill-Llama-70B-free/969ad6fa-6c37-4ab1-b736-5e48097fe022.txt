Question:

List and describe the stages of problem solving as proposed by Johnson.

Options:

A: Johnson proposed the stages of conceptualization, experimentation, and reflection for problem solving.
B: Johnson suggested that the stages of problem solving are analysis, implementation, and feedback.
C: The stages of problem solving are production, judgment, and incubation.
D: The three stages of problem solving according to Donald M. Johnson are preparation, production, and judgment.
E: Johnson's stages of problem solving include orientation, negotiation, and verification.
F: The stages of problem solving by Johnson are defined as comprehension, application, and consolidation.
G: Johnson's model includes the stages of recognition, strategy formulation, and monitoring.
H: According to Johnson, the stages of problem solving are preparation, execution, and evaluation.
I: The problem-solving stages outlined by Johnson are identification, exploration, and resolution.
J: According to Johnson, the stages are framing the problem, finding solutions, and assessing outcomes.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the stages of problem solving proposed by Johnson. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that there are several models of problem-solving stages. I think some models have steps like define, design, develop, etc. But the question specifically mentions Johnson, so I need to focus on what Johnson's stages are.

I recall that Johnson's model is one of the earlier ones. I think it's divided into three main stages. Let me try to remember the terms. Preparation, incubation, and something else? Wait, no, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, I think Johnson's stages are preparation, production, and judgment. Preparation is like understanding the problem, production is coming up with solutions, and judgment is evaluating them. That rings a bell. So looking at the options, I should find an option that lists these three.

Looking at the choices:

Option D says: The three stages of problem solving according to Donald M. Johnson are preparation, production, and judgment. That matches what I was thinking.

Let me check the other options to make sure. Option A has conceptualization, experimentation, reflection. That doesn't sound familiar. Option B is analysis, implementation, feedback. No, that's more like a project management approach maybe. Option C is production, judgment, incubation. Incubation is part of the creative problem-solving process, like in Wallas' model, I believe. So that's probably not Johnson.

Option D seems correct. The other options don't fit what I remember about Johnson's stages.

The correct answer is D: The three stages of problem solving according to Donald M. Johnson are preparation, production, and judgment.

Answer: D
