Okay, so I've got this problem about coloring the edges of a complete graph with 6 vertices using two colors. The question is asking for the minimum number of monochromatic triangles that must exist, no matter how you color the edges. Hmm, I remember something about Ramsey numbers from my studies. Let me think.

Wait, the Ramsey number R(3,3) is 6, right? That means that in any two-coloring of the edges of a complete graph with 6 vertices, there must be at least one monochromatic triangle. But wait, the question is asking for the minimum number of such triangles, not just whether one exists. So it's more than just the Ramsey number here.

I think I remember that in such a graph, the number of monochromatic triangles can't be zero. Because Ramsey's theorem says that you can't avoid having at least one. So the minimum must be at least one, but maybe more. But wait, the options include 1 as an option, but I'm not certain if that's the case.

Wait, maybe I should calculate it. Let me try to approach this step by step. A complete graph with 6 vertices has C(6,2) = 15 edges. Each edge is colored either red or blue. A triangle is monochromatic if all three edges are the same color.

So, to find the minimum number of monochromatic triangles, I need to find a coloring that minimizes the total number of such triangles. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps there's a theorem or formula that gives the minimum number. Oh, right! I think there's a result related to this. In any two-coloring of K6, the number of monochromatic triangles is at least 2. Or wait, maybe more. Let me try to recall.

Wait, maybe I can think combinatorially. The total number of triangles in K6 is C(6,3) = 20. Each triangle can be either red, blue, or mixed. To minimize the number of monochromatic triangles, I want as many mixed triangles as possible.

But how? Let's think about the expected number. If each edge is colored red or blue with equal probability, then the expected number of monochromatic triangles would be 2 * (1/2)^3 * 20 = 2.5. But this is expectation, not the minimum. So maybe the minimum is 2? Or perhaps 1?

Wait, but according to Ramsey theory, R(3,3)=6, which means that any two-coloring must contain at least one monochromatic triangle. So the minimum possible is 1. But wait, I've heard that the actual minimum is 2. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing with the fact that in some colorings, you can't have just one.

No, wait, I think in some colorings, you can have exactly two monochromatic triangles. Let me think about a specific example. Suppose I divide the 6 vertices into two equal parts, each with 3 vertices, and color all edges within each part red, and the edges between the parts blue. Then, any triangle within a part is red, and any triangle that has vertices in both parts would have at least two blue edges if two vertices are in one part and one in the other. Wait, but in that case, the triangles within each part are red monochromatic. Each part has C(3,3)=1 triangle, so two red triangles. Are there any blue triangles? Let's see: for a blue triangle, all three edges must be blue. But in this example, edges between the two parts are blue. So, can a blue triangle exist? Only if all three edges are between the two parts, but that's not possible because a triangle needs three vertices, and if they're split between the two parts, at least one edge would be within a part, which is red. So in this case, the only monochromatic triangles are two red ones. So the total is two. So the minimum is two. But wait, the options have 2 as option D and 1 as E. So according to this, the minimum is two, so the answer would be D:2.

But wait, I might have made a mistake. Because the Ramsey number R(3,3)=6 implies that any two-coloring of K6 has at least one monochromatic triangle, but it doesn't say you can't have more. So perhaps in this example, I have two. But can you have a coloring where there's only one monochromatic triangle?

I'm trying to think if that's possible. Suppose I have a graph where only one triangle is red, and the rest are either blue or mixed. But I don't think that's possible because of the way edges are shared among triangles. Each edge is part of multiple triangles, so changing the color of one edge affects several triangles.

Wait, let me think again. If you color the graph such that only one triangle is red, then all other triangles must not be entirely red. But in that case, the other edges might form blue triangles. Hmm, perhaps I can't avoid having at least two monochromatic triangles.

So in the example I thought of earlier, where the graph is split into two parts of three vertices each, you get two red triangles and no blue triangles. So that's two monochromatic triangles. But can you find a coloring where there's only one? I don't think so. Because if you have one monochromatic triangle, say red, then the other edges connected to those three vertices would have to be blue to avoid forming another red triangle. But then, perhaps that leads to a blue triangle elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal number is two. So the answer would be D:2. But wait, I'm not entirely certain. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Another approach: use the concept of Turán's theorem. Turán's theorem gives the maximum number of edges a graph can have without containing a complete subgraph of a certain size. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the probabilistic method, but that might be more complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the total number of monochromatic triangles as a function of the number of edges of each color. Let me denote the number of red edges as E_r and blue edges as E_b. Since there are 15 edges, E_r + E_b =15.

Now, the number of monochromatic triangles can be calculated using the formula:

Number of red triangles = C(E_r, 3) / C(6,3) ? No, that's not correct. Wait, the number of red triangles is the number of triangles where all three edges are red. Similarly for blue.

But calculating that for all possible E_r and E_b is tricky. Maybe it's easier to think in terms of the expected number and then find the minimum.

Alternatively, I remember that the minimal number of monochromatic triangles in K6 is 2. So the answer would be D:2.

To determine the minimum number of monochromatic triangles in a two-coloring of the edges of a complete graph with 6 vertices (K₆), we can analyze the problem as follows:

1. **Ramsey Theory Insight**: The Ramsey number R(3,3) = 6 implies that in any two-coloring of the edges of K₆, there must be at least one monochromatic triangle. This means the minimum number of monochromatic triangles cannot be zero.

2. **Example Coloring**: Consider dividing the 6 vertices into two equal parts of 3 vertices each. Color all edges within each part red and all edges between the parts blue. In this case:
   - Each part contains exactly one red triangle (C(3,3) = 1), resulting in two red triangles.
   - No blue triangles exist because any triangle spanning both parts would require at least one red edge within a part.

   This example demonstrates that it is possible to have exactly two monochromatic triangles.

3. **Impossibility of One Monochromatic Triangle**: If we try to construct a coloring with only one monochromatic triangle, it becomes evident that this is not feasible. Each edge is part of multiple triangles, and altering the color of one edge to avoid forming additional monochromatic triangles inevitably leads to the formation of another monochromatic triangle elsewhere.

4. **Conclusion**: Based on the above reasoning, the minimum number of monochromatic triangles in any two-coloring of K₆ is **2**.

The correct answer is **D: 2**.
