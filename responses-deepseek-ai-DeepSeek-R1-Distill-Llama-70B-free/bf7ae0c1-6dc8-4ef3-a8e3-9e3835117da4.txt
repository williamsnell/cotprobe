Okay, so I've got this accounting problem here about McLevin's Sporting Goods Shop. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that McLevin's started December with an inventory worth $27,300. Then during the month, they bought more skating goods for $3,940 and ski equipment costing $6,340. But wait, some of the ski equipment was damaged, and they returned $210 worth for credit. At the end of the month, their sales totaled $26,800, and their merchandise inventory was valued at $22,300.

The questions are a) to find the cost of goods sold, and b) to find the gross profit. The options are given from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that the cost of goods sold (COGS) is calculated using the formula:

COGS = Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory + Returns (if any)

Wait, no, maybe it's more like:

COGS = Beginning Inventory + Net Purchases - Ending Inventory

Where net purchases would be the total purchases minus any returns or allowances.

So let me break it down. The beginning inventory is $27,300. Then they made purchases: skating goods for $3,940 and ski equipment for $6,340. So total purchases would be 3,940 + 6,340 = $10,280.

But wait, they returned some ski equipment worth $210 for credit. So the net purchases would be total purchases minus the returns. So that's 10,280 - 210 = $10,070.

Then, the ending inventory is $22,300. So plugging into the formula:

COGS = 27,300 + 10,070 - 22,300.

Let me calculate that. 27,300 plus 10,070 is 37,370. Then subtract 22,300 from that: 37,370 - 22,300 = $15,070.

So the cost of goods sold is $15,070. Now, for the gross profit. I think gross profit is calculated as Sales minus COGS.

So sales are $26,800. So gross profit = 26,800 - 15,070 = $11,730.

Looking at the options, option A says COGS $15,070 and Gross profit $11,730. That matches my calculations. So the answer should be A.

Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

1. Beginning inventory: $27,300.
2. Purchases: $3,940 + $6,340 = $10,280.
3. Returns: $210, so net purchases are $10,280 - $210 = $10,070.
4. COGS = 27,300 + 10,070 - 22,300 = 15,070. That looks right.
5. Gross profit: 26,800 - 15,070 = 11,730. Yep.

So I think I'm confident that the correct answer is option A.

To solve the problem, we calculate the cost of goods sold (COGS) and gross profit using the given data:

1. **Beginning Inventory**: $27,300  
2. **Total Purchases**: $3,940 (skating goods) + $6,340 (ski equipment) = $10,280  
3. **Returns**: $210 (damage), so **Net Purchases** = $10,280 - $210 = $10,070  
4. **Ending Inventory**: $22,300  

Using the COGS formula:  
\[
\text{COGS} = \text{Beginning Inventory} + \text{Net Purchases} - \text{Ending Inventory}
\]  
\[
\text{COGS} = 27,300 + 10,070 - 22,300 = 15,070
\]

Next, calculate the **Gross Profit**:  
\[
\text{Gross Profit} = \text{Sales} - \text{COGS}
\]  
\[
\text{Gross Profit} = 26,800 - 15,070 = 11,730
\]

Matching these values with the options, the correct answer is **A**.
