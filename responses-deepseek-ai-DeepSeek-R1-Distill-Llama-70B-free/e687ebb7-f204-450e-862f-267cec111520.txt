Question:

A gardener sued a homeowner for breach of contract. The gardener claims that the homeowner hired him to perform landscape work at his home. After performing the gardening services, the homeowner paid him $100. The gardener, who speaks only English, contends that the homeowner, who speaks only Japanese, originally agreed to pay him $200 for the work. When the parties entered into their agreement, the gardener was accompanied by his friend, who is now deceased, who spoke both English and Japanese. This jurisdiction has a typical Dead Man's Statute in effect. At trial, the gardener now seeks to testify to the terms of his agreement with the homeowner as communicated to him by his friend. Upon objection by the homeowner's attorney, the gardener's proposed testimony is

Options:

A: inadmissible, as it is hearsay and not an exception under the Dead Man's Statute.
B: inadmissible, because the gardener did not have a translator present during the agreement.
C: admissible, as it is relevant to the case and not excluded by the Dead Man's Statute.
D: admissible as non-hearsay to corroborate evidence of a verbal act.
E: inadmissible, because the friend was not an official translator.
F: admissible, because it is a statement of a deceased person.
G: admissible as an admission by a party-opponent.
H: inadmissible, unless it is established that the gardener accepted the friend as the homeowner's agent in communicating the terms of the contract.
I: admissible, as it is a statement made during the course of employment.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence question. Let me break it down step by step. 

The scenario is about a gardener suing a homeowner for breach of contract. The gardener claims they agreed on $200, but only got $100. The issue is about the admissibility of the gardener's testimony regarding the terms of the agreement as communicated by his deceased friend.

First, I need to understand the legal issues here. The main points are the Dead Man's Statute and hearsay exceptions. 

The Dead Man's Statute generally prohibits a party from testifying about conversations they had with a deceased person when the other party is alive. But there are exceptions. So, if the gardener is testifying about what his friend told him, and the friend is deceased, the Dead Man's Statute might apply.

Wait, but the gardener is trying to testify about what the friend (who acted as a translator) told him. So, the friend's statements would usually be hearsay because they're out-of-court statements offered for the truth. But the friend is deceased, so maybe an exception applies.

I remember that statements by deceased persons can sometimes be admissible under certain exceptions, like if they were made in the course of employment or as a party's statement. Alternatively, the translator's statements might be non-hearsay if they're not being offered for the truth but just to show the communication happened.

Wait, another angle: the gardener is testifying about what the friend told him. The friend's statements would be offered to prove the terms of the contract, so that's for the truth, making it hearsay. 

But under the Dead Man's Statute, can the gardener testify about this? Some jurisdictions allow an exception when the deceased was acting as an interpreter. Or maybe the statement falls under another hearsay exception, like statements of personal or family history, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the friend's translation isn't hearsay because it's not a statement offered to prove the truth, but just to show that the communication happened. But I'm not certain about that. 

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's inadmissible as hearsay and not an exception under the Dead Man's Statute. So if the testimony is hearsay and the Dead Man's Statute doesn't allow it, this would be correct.

Option H says it's inadmissible unless the gardener accepted the friend as the homeowner's agent. Hmm, that makes sense because if the friend was acting as the agent of the homeowner, then his statements would be admissions by a party-opponent, which is a hearsay exception. But was the friend the agent? The problem says the friend was the gardener's friend, not necessarily the homeowner's agent. So maybe the friend wasn't acting as the homeowner's agent, so the statement wouldn't qualify as a party admission.

Option D says it's admissible as non-hearsay to corroborate a verbal act. I'm not sure about this. Verbal acts are about the fact that something was said, not the truth of it. So if the gardener is testifying that the friend told him the price was $200, it's about the content, which is for the truth, so it's hearsay. So D might not apply.

Option G suggests it's an admission by a party-opponent. But the friend isn't a party, so their statements wouldn't be party admissions. Unless the friend was acting on behalf of the homeowner, which isn't indicated here.

Option F says it's admissible because it's a statement of a deceased person. But that's too broad; the Dead Man's Statute has specific rules, and just being deceased doesn't automatically make it admissible.

Option C says it's admissible and not excluded by the Dead Man's Statute. I'm not sure. The Dead Man's Statute might prevent the gardener from testifying about his conversations with the deceased friend when the other party (homeowner) is alive. So if the statute applies, the testimony is inadmissible.

Option B says inadmissible because no translator was present. But the friend was the translator, so that's not the issue. The issue is the admissibility based on hearsay and the Dead Man's Statute.

Option I says it's admissible as a statement during employment. The friend wasn't employed, so that doesn't apply.

So, putting it together: The gardener's testimony is about what his deceased friend (translator) told him about the agreement. The friend's statements are hearsay. The Dead Man's Statute would generally prevent the gardener from testifying about conversations with the deceased when the other party is alive, unless an exception applies. 

But wait, the Dead Man's Statute usually applies when the testifying party is the one who had the conversation with the deceased. So in this case, the gardener is testifying about his own conversation with the deceased friend. The Dead Man's Statute in some jurisdictions allows the opposing party to testify about the deceased's statements, but the same party (gardener) can't testify about their own conversations with the deceased because it's considered self-serving.

Alternatively, perhaps the friend's translation is considered part of the contract formation, so the gardener's testimony about what he was told by the translator is necessary. But legally, the friend's statements would still be hearsay unless an exception applies.

Wait, another thought: When a person acts as an interpreter, their translation isn't hearsay because it's not being offered for the truth of the matter, but to show what was communicated. So maybe it's non-hearsay. Or perhaps it's hearsay, but falls under the translation exception.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again. The gardener is testifying to what the friend told him, which is an out-of-court statement. So it's hearsay. The only way it's admissible is if it fits an exception.

If the friend's statement is offered to prove the terms of the contract, it's hearsay. Unless it's a statement by the party's agent or someone with authority, which it's not, since the friend was the gardener's friend, not the homeowner's agent.

So without an exception, the testimony is hearsay and inadmissible. The Dead Man's Statute also applies, preventing the gardener from testifying about his own conversations with the deceased.

So the correct answer would be that the testimony is inadmissible. Looking at the options, option A says it's inadmissible as hearsay and not an exception under the Dead Man's Statute. That seems correct.

Alternatively, option H says it's inadmissible unless the gardener accepted the friend as the homeowner's agent. If the friend wasn't the agent, then the statement isn't admissible. So H could also be correct.

Wait, but the question is about the admissibility. The Dead Man's Statute would prevent the gardener from testifying about the deceased friend's statements because the other party is alive. So even if it's hearsay, the Dead Man's Statute makes it inadmissible. Or is it the other way around?

I think the key is that the Dead Man's Statute applies here, making the testimony inadmissible unless an exception exists. Since the friend wasn't the agent, there's no exception. So the testimony is inadmissible.

Looking at the options, option A says it's inadmissible as hearsay and not an exception under the Dead Man's Statute. So that fits.

Alternatively, option H says it's inadmissible unless the gardener accepted the friend as the agent. If the friend wasn't accepted as the agent, then H would make it inadmissible.

Wait, but the question is about the admissibility of the gardener's testimony. The gardener is trying to testify about what the friend told him. If the friend wasn't the agent, then the statements aren't admissible as party admissions, so they remain hearsay. So H's reasoning is about agency, not about hearsay exceptions.

So in that case, the correct reasoning would be that the testimony is hearsay and not covered by an exception, making it inadmissible. So option A is correct.

Alternatively, if the testimony is allowed under an exception, then it's admissible. But I don't think so because the friend's statements don't fall under a hearsay exception unless it's something like a statement against interest, which it's not.

So I'm leaning towards option A being correct.

The question revolves around the admissibility of the gardener's testimony regarding the terms of the agreement as communicated by his deceased friend, who acted as a translator. The legal issues at play are hearsay and the Dead Man's Statute.

1. **Hearsay Analysis**: The gardener's testimony about what the friend told him is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter (the agreed payment of $200). This makes it hearsay. For it to be admissible, it must fall under a recognized hearsay exception.

2. **Dead Man's Statute**: This statute generally prohibits a party from testifying about conversations with a deceased person when the opposing party is alive. The gardener is testifying about his own conversations with the deceased friend, which would typically be barred under the Dead Man's Statute unless an exception applies.

3. **Exceptions Considered**:
   - The friend's statements do not qualify as admissions by a party-opponent because the friend was not acting as the homeowner's agent.
   - There is no indication that the friend's statements fall under other hearsay exceptions, such as statements against interest or statements made in the course of employment.
   - The friend's role as a translator does not automatically make the statements admissible unless they are non-hearsay or fall under a specific exception.

4. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Correct. The testimony is inadmissible because it is hearsay and does not fall under an exception to the Dead Man's Statute.
   - **Option H**: While it correctly states that the testimony is inadmissible unless the friend was accepted as the homeowner's agent, this reasoning is unnecessary because the primary issue is the inadmissibility under hearsay and the Dead Man's Statute.

Given the analysis, the testimony is inadmissible as hearsay and not covered by an exception under the Dead Man's Statute.
