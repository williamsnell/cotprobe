Okay, so I need to figure out how a photosynthetic plant growing in soil that's deficient in iron and magnesium would look. Hmm, I remember that plants require various nutrients for different functions. Let me think about each nutrient's role.

Iron is important for plants because it's involved in the production of chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is essential for photosynthesis, right? Without enough iron, the plant can't make as much chlorophyll, which would affect its ability to photosynthesize. That probably means the leaves might not be as green as they should be. I've heard of a condition called chlorosis where the leaves turn yellow because of a lack of chlorophyll. So maybe the leaves would be yellowish.

Magnesium is also a key component of chlorophyll. So if the soil is deficient in magnesium, the plant can't produce enough chlorophyll either. This would also lead to chlorosis, making the leaves yellow. But wait, both iron and magnesium are involved in chlorophyll, so a deficiency in either would cause similar symptoms. Oh, but wait, maybe there's more to it. I think magnesium deficiency can cause the older leaves to turn yellow first, while iron deficiency affects the younger leaves. But in this case, the soil is deficient in both, so maybe both sets of leaves would be yellow.

Now, considering growth. Both iron and magnesium are important for overall plant health. If a plant can't photosynthesize efficiently because of low chlorophyll, it won't produce enough energy. That would likely result in stunted growth. The plant might be small, not growing as tall as it should. Also, since it's not getting enough nutrients, the stems might be weak, making the plant look feeble or spindly.

Looking at the options, I need to find one that describes a plant that's yellow, small, and not robust. Let me go through the choices:

A: pale, small, short, weak - Pale could mean not green, but pale might be more like white. Not sure if that's the same as yellow.

B: Dark, small, feeble - Dark doesn't fit because if chlorophyll is low, leaves are lighter, not darker.

C: Purple, robust, average height - Purple plants are usually due to anthocyanins, which I don't think is related to iron/magnesium deficiency.

D: yellow, small, feeble - This fits. Yellow from chlorosis, small and feeble because of poor growth.

E: Green, small, sturdy - If they're green, that would mean they have chlorophyll, which shouldn't be the case here.

F: Pale, tall, spindly - Pale might be due to other issues, like nitrogen deficiency maybe. But tall and spindly could be from lack of light, but not sure if it's linked here.

G: Green, tall, strong - Definitely not, since chlorophyll is low.

H: Yellow, tall, robust - Robust doesn't fit because the plant would be weak.

I: Variegated leaves... that's more like a genetic thing, not nutrient deficiency.

J: Dark, large, robust - Again, dark leaves suggest plenty of chlorophyll, which isn't the case.

So the best fit is D: yellow, small, and feeble.

The plant would likely exhibit chlorosis due to insufficient chlorophyll production from the lack of iron and magnesium. This results in yellow leaves. Additionally, poor nutrient availability impairs growth, leading to a small, feeble appearance.

Answer: D
