Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to round the number .1476 to different decimal places. The question has three parts: (a) to 2 decimal places, (b) to 3 decimal places, and (c) to 1 decimal place. Then I have to choose the correct option from A to J based on my answers.

Let me start by recalling how rounding works. Rounding a number to a certain decimal place means looking at the digit immediately after that place to decide whether to round up or keep it the same. If the next digit is 5 or higher, we round up the previous digit by one. If it's less than 5, we leave it as is.

First, part (a) asks for rounding to two decimal places. The number is .1476. Let's break it down. The first decimal place is 1, the second is 4, the third is 7, and the fourth is 6. So when rounding to two decimal places, I look at the third decimal, which is 7. Since 7 is greater than 5, I need to round the second decimal place up. The second decimal is 4, so adding 1 makes it 5. So .1476 rounded to two decimals becomes .15.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure. The number is .1476. So the two decimal places are the first and second digits after the decimal: 1 and 4. The next digit is 7, which is the third place. Since 7 >=5, we round the second digit up. So 4 becomes 5, making it .15. Yep, that's correct.

Now part (b), rounding to three decimal places. So three decimals are 1,4,7. The next digit is 6, the fourth decimal place. Since 6 is more than 5, we round up the third place. The third digit is 7, adding 1 makes it 8. So .1476 rounded to three decimals is .148.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. The number is .1476. Three decimal places would be up to the 7. The next digit is 6, which is more than 5, so the 7 becomes 8. So yes, .148.

Now part (c), rounding to one decimal place. One decimal is the first digit, which is 1. The next digit is 4, which is the second decimal place. Since 4 is less than 5, we don't round up. So the first decimal stays 1, and everything after is dropped. So it becomes .1.

Wait, but wait. The number is .1476. After the first decimal (1) comes 4. Since 4 is less than 5, we leave the 1 as it is. So .1 is correct.

Now I need to look at the options and find which one matches all three parts.

Let me list my findings:

(a) .15
(b) .148
(c) .1

Looking at the options:

Option A:
(a) .15, (b) .148, (c) .1 → This matches what I have.

Option B:
(a) .15, (b) .147, (c) .14 → (b) is wrong, (c) is .14, which doesn't match.

Option C:
(a) .14, which is wrong.

Option D:
(a) .14, wrong.

Option E:
(a) .15, (b) .149, which is wrong.

Option F:
(a) .14, wrong.

Option G:
(a) .15, (b) .147, which is wrong.

Option H:
(a) .15, (b) .149, wrong.

Option I:
(a) .14, wrong.

Option J:
(a) .14, wrong.

So the correct option should be A.

To solve the problem of rounding the number **.1476** to different decimal places, we follow these steps:

1. **Rounding to 2 decimal places (a):**  
   - The number is **.1476**.  
   - Focus on the first two decimals: **1** (tenths place) and **4** (hundredths place).  
   - The next digit (thousandths place) is **7**, which is greater than 5.  
   - Therefore, we round the hundredths place up: **4** becomes **5**.  
   - Result: **.15**.

2. **Rounding to 3 decimal places (b):**  
   - The number is **.1476**.  
   - Focus on the first three decimals: **1**, **4**, and **7**.  
   - The next digit (ten-thousandths place) is **6**, which is greater than 5.  
   - Therefore, we round the thousandths place up: **7** becomes **8**.  
   - Result: **.148**.

3. **Rounding to 1 decimal place (c):**  
   - The number is **.1476**.  
   - Focus on the tenths place: **1**.  
   - The next digit (hundredths place) is **4**, which is less than 5.  
   - Therefore, we leave the tenths place unchanged.  
   - Result: **.1**.

Now, comparing the results **(a) .15, (b) .148, (c) .1** with the given options:

- **Option A:** (a) .15, (b) .148, (c) .1 → Matches perfectly.  
- **Option B:** (a) .15, (b) .147, (c) .14 → Incorrect for (b) and (c).  
- **Option C:** (a) .14 → Incorrect for (a).  
- **Option D:** (a) .14 → Incorrect for (a).  
- **Option E:** (a) .15, (b) .149 → Incorrect for (b).  
- **Option F:** (a) .14 → Incorrect for (a).  
- **Option G:** (a) .15, (b) .147 → Incorrect for (b).  
- **Option H:** (a) .15, (b) .149 → Incorrect for (b).  
- **Option I:** (a) .14 → Incorrect for (a).  
- **Option J:** (a) .14 → Incorrect for (a).  

The correct answer is **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
