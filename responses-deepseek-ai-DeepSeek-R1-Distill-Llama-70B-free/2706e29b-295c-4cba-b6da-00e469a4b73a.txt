Okay, so I've got this question about the coefficient of compressibility for an ideal gas at constant temperature. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on thermodynamics, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, the coefficient of compressibility... I remember it's also called the isothermal compressibility. Right, because it's about how much the volume changes under pressure at constant temperature. Oh yeah, the formula involves the change in volume with pressure.

The general formula for isothermal compressibility (κ) is the negative of the derivative of volume with respect to pressure, divided by the volume itself. So, κ = - (1/V) * (dV/dP) at constant T.

But wait, for an ideal gas, we can probably express this in terms of the ideal gas law. The ideal gas law is PV = nRT. Since temperature is constant, n and T are fixed, so P and V are inversely related. 

Let me rearrange the ideal gas law to express V in terms of P. So V = nRT / P. Now, I need to find dV/dP. Taking the derivative of V with respect to P, I get dV/dP = -nRT / P². 

Putting that back into the κ formula: κ = - (1/V) * (-nRT / P²). The negatives cancel out. So κ becomes (nRT)/(P² V). But wait, from the ideal gas law, nRT = PV. So substituting that in, κ = (PV)/(P² V) = 1/P. 

Wait, that's interesting. So κ is 1/P. But wait, let's check the options. Option J is 1/p. But wait, why are there other options with nRT in them?

Wait another thought: Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. The coefficient of compressibility is κ_T = - (1/V)(dV/dP)_T. For an ideal gas, dV/dP at constant T is dV/dP = (nRT)/(P²). Oh wait, because V = nRT/P, so dV/dP is -nRT/(P²). 

So κ_T = - (1/V) * (-nRT/P²) = (nRT)/(P² V). But since PV =nRT, V = nRT/P. Substituting V into the expression: (nRT)/(P² * (nRT/P)) ) = (nRT * P)/(P² nRT) ) = 1/P. 

So κ_T is 1/P. Looking at the options, J is 1/p. But wait, let's look at the options again. Option I is (pV)/(nRT), which is 1 because PV =nRT. So I is 1. Option J is 1/p. 

So the correct answer should be J. But wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing up similar terms. Oh wait, another approach: the coefficient of compressibility is sometimes expressed as (1/p), but I might also be confusing it with other coefficients. Alternatively, another way to think about it is using the equation of state.

Alternatively, another approach: The isothermal compressibility is given by κ_T = (1/p) - (p/(something)), but no, that doesn't make sense. No, I think the correct derivation leads to κ_T = 1/p.

So looking back at the options, the correct answer should be J: (1/p).

The coefficient of compressibility (isothermal compressibility) for an ideal gas is defined as:

\[
\kappa_T = -\frac{1}{V} \left( \frac{\partial V}{\partial P} \right)_T
\]

Using the ideal gas law \( PV = nRT \), the volume can be expressed as \( V = \frac{nRT}{P} \). Taking the derivative of \( V \) with respect to \( P \) at constant \( T \), we get:

\[
\left( \frac{\partial V}{\partial P} \right)_T = -\frac{nRT}{P^2}
\]

Substituting this into the expression for \( \kappa_T \):

\[
\kappa_T = -\frac{1}{V} \left( -\frac{nRT}{P^2} \right) = \frac{nRT}{P^2 V}
\]

Using the ideal gas law again (\( V = \frac{nRT}{P} \)), we substitute \( V \) into the equation:

\[
\kappa_T = \frac{nRT}{P^2 \cdot \frac{nRT}{P}} = \frac{1}{P}
\]

Thus, the coefficient of compressibility for an ideal gas at constant temperature is \( \frac{1}{P} \). Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**J: (1/p)**
