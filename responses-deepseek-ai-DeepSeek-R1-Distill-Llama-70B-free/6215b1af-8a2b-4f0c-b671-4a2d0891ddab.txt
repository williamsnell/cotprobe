Question:

You want to cluster 7 points into 3 clusters using the k-Means Clustering algorithm. Suppose after the first iteration, clusters C1, C2 and C3 contain the following two-dimensional points: C1 contains the 2 points: {(0,6), (6,0)} C2 contains the 3 points: {(2,2), (4,4), (6,6)} C3 contains the 2 points: {(5,5), (7,7)} What are the cluster centers computed for these 3 clusters?

Options:

A: C1: (3,3), C2: (6,6), C3: (12,12)
B: C1: (6,6), C2: (12,12), C3: (12,12)
C: C1: (3,3), C2: (4,4), C3: (6,6)
D: C1: (1,1), C2: (4,4), C3: (6,6)
E: C1: (0,0), C2: (4,4), C3: (6,6)
F: C1: (6,0), C2: (4,4), C3: (7,7)
G: C1: (3,3), C2: (2,2), C3: (7,7)
H: C1: (2,2), C2: (5,5), C3: (7,7)

Okay, so I've got this question about k-Means clustering, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question says.

The problem is about clustering 7 points into 3 clusters using the k-Means algorithm. After the first iteration, the clusters are given as follows:

- C1 has 2 points: (0,6) and (6,0)
- C2 has 3 points: (2,2), (4,4), (6,6)
- C3 has 2 points: (5,5) and (7,7)

And the question is asking for the cluster centers computed for these clusters. The options are from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, right. I remember that in k-Means, after assigning the points to clusters, you calculate the centroid of each cluster, which becomes the new cluster center for the next iteration. The centroid is just the average of all the points in the cluster.

So, I should compute the centroid for each of the three clusters.

Let me start with C1. It has two points: (0,6) and (6,0). To find the centroid, I'll average the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates separately.

For the x-coordinates: (0 + 6)/2 = 6/2 = 3
For the y-coordinates: (6 + 0)/2 = 6/2 = 3
So the centroid for C1 is (3,3).

Next, C2 has three points: (2,2), (4,4), and (6,6). Let's compute the average.

x-coordinates: (2 + 4 + 6) = 12. Divide by 3: 12/3 = 4
y-coordinates: (2 + 4 + 6) = 12. Divide by 3: 12/3 = 4
So the centroid for C2 is (4,4).

Now, C3 has two points: (5,5) and (7,7). Let's compute the centroid.

x: (5 +7)/2 = 12/2 =6
y: (5+7)/2 =12/2=6
So centroid is (6,6).

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to be sure.

For C1:
x: 0 +6 =6 → 6/2=3
y:6+0=6 →6/2=3. Correct.

C2:
x: 2+4=6 +6=12 → 12/3=4
y: same as x. So (4,4). Correct.

C3:
x:5+7=12 →12/2=6
y: same. So (6,6). Correct.

So putting it all together, the cluster centers are:
C1: (3,3)
C2: (4,4)
C3: (6,6)

Now, looking at the options:

Option C says C1: (3,3), C2: (4,4), C3: (6,6). That matches exactly.

Wait, but let me check all options in case I'm mixing them up.

Option A: C1 (3,3), C2 (6,6), C3 (12,12). No, C3 is (6,6), not (12,12).

Option C: As above, correct.

Option D: C1 (1,1), which is wrong. So no.

Option E: C1 (0,0), no.

Option F: C1 (6,0), no.

Option G: C1 (3,3), C2 (2,2), which is wrong because C2's centroid is (4,4).

So the correct option is C.

To determine the cluster centers after the first iteration of the k-Means algorithm, we calculate the centroid of each cluster by averaging the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the points within the cluster. Here's the computation for each cluster:

1. **Cluster C1**: Contains points {(0,6), (6,0)}  
   - Centroid x-coordinate: \((0 + 6)/2 = 3\)  
   - Centroid y-coordinate: \((6 + 0)/2 = 3\)  
   - Centroid: \((3, 3)\)

2. **Cluster C2**: Contains points {(2,2), (4,4), (6,6)}  
   - Centroid x-coordinate: \((2 + 4 + 6)/3 = 4\)  
   - Centroid y-coordinate: \((2 + 4 + 6)/3 = 4\)  
   - Centroid: \((4, 4)\)

3. **Cluster C3**: Contains points {(5,5), (7,7)}  
   - Centroid x-coordinate: \((5 + 7)/2 = 6\)  
   - Centroid y-coordinate: \((5 + 7)/2 = 6\)  
   - Centroid: \((6, 6)\)

Thus, the cluster centers are:  
- C1: \((3, 3)\)  
- C2: \((4, 4)\)  
- C3: \((6, 6)\)

From the given options, the correct choice is **C**, as it matches the computed centroids.
