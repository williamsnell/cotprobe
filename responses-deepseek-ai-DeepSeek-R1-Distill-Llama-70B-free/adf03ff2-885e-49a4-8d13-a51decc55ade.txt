Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about group theory, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by breaking down each statement and analyzing them.

The question has two statements:

Statement 1: For finite groups G and H, |G + H| = |G||H|. Here, G + H is the internal direct product.

Statement 2: If r divides m and s divides n, then Z_m + Z_n has a subgroup isomorphic to Z_r + Z_s.

I need to determine if each statement is true or false and then pick the correct option from the choices given.

Starting with Statement 1. I remember that the internal direct product of two groups G and H is when G and H are normal subgroups of a group, say K, such that K is the product of G and H. The order of the direct product should be |G| * |H| if G and H have trivial intersection (only the identity element in common). So for finite groups, if G and H are both subgroups of some group and their intersection is trivial, then |G + H| would indeed be |G||H|. But wait, in the case where G and H are not subgroups of a larger group but are being directly multiplied, like in the external direct product, then yes, the order is |G||H|. But the question specifies it's the internal direct product. So I think Statement 1 is correct. Wait, but wait—could there be a case where the internal product's order isn't the product of the orders? Hmm, no, because for the internal direct product, G and H must intersect trivially, so the order is |G| * |H|. So Statement 1 is true.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. I remember that the internal and external direct products are isomorphic when the groups are finite. So in that case, the order would be the product. So yes, Statement 1 is true. So I think Statement 1 is true.

Wait, but no—wait a second. Wait, what if G and H are both subgroups but their product isn't the entire group? No, no, the internal direct product requires that every element can be uniquely written as a product of an element from G and an element from H. So their orders must multiply. So yes, the order of G + H would be |G||H|. So Statement 1 is correct.

Now moving on to Statement 2. It says that if r divides m and s divides n, then Z_m + Z_n has a subgroup isomorphic to Z_r + Z_s. 

I think this relates to the structure theorem for finite abelian groups. Since Z_m and Z_n are cyclic groups, their direct product Z_m + Z_n is isomorphic to Z_k + Z_l where k divides m and l divides n or something like that. Wait, but in general, the direct product of two cyclic groups can be decomposed into a direct sum of cyclic groups of prime power order.

But wait, the statement is about having a subgroup isomorphic to Z_r + Z_s. So if r divides m and s divides n, then can we find a subgroup in Z_m + Z_n that is isomorphic to Z_r + Z_s?

Let me think. For example, take m = 4 and n = 6. Then r could be 2 and s could be 2. Then Z_4 + Z_6 would have a subgroup isomorphic to Z_2 + Z_2. Is that true?

Alternatively, considering the projection maps. Since Z_r is a subgroup of Z_m when r divides m, perhaps we can take the product of these subgroups. So in Z_m, there's a subgroup of order r, which is Z_r, and similarly in Z_n, a subgroup Z_s. Then the direct product of these two would be a subgroup of Z_m + Z_n, and that product would be Z_r + Z_s. That makes sense because the direct product of subgroups is a subgroup of the direct product.

So Statement 2 is true as long as r divides m and s divides n, which is exactly what the statement says. So Statement 2 is correct.

Wait, but wait—could there be a case where even if r divides m and s divides n, the direct sum doesn't have such a subgroup? I don't think so because the direct product of subgroups is a subgroup. So yes, Statement 2 is true.

Wait, but earlier I thought Statement 1 was true. So if both statements are true, then I need to look at the options. The options are combinations of whether each statement is true or false.

Looking back at the options, option J says both statements are true. Let me check.

Option J: True, True. So that would be correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit uncertain about Statement 1. Let me re-verify. The internal direct product's order is indeed the product of the orders of G and H because they have trivial intersection. So yes, Statement 1 is correct.

So both statements are true. Therefore, the correct answer should be option J.

Statement 1: For finite groups \( G \) and \( H \), the internal direct product \( G + H \) has order \( |G||H| \). This is true because the internal direct product requires that \( G \) and \( H \) intersect trivially, meaning their intersection contains only the identity element. As a result, the order of \( G + H \) is the product of the orders of \( G \) and \( H \). 

Statement 2: If \( r \) divides \( m \) and \( s \) divides \( n \), then \( \mathbb{Z}_m + \mathbb{Z}_n \) has a subgroup isomorphic to \( \mathbb{Z}_r + \mathbb{Z}_s \). This is also true. Since \( \mathbb{Z}_r \) is a subgroup of \( \mathbb{Z}_m \) when \( r \) divides \( m \), and \( \mathbb{Z}_s \) is a subgroup of \( \mathbb{Z}_n \) when \( s \) divides \( n \), the direct product of these subgroups, \( \mathbb{Z}_r + \mathbb{Z}_s \), is a subgroup of \( \mathbb{Z}_m + \mathbb{Z}_n \).

Since both statements are true, the correct answer is:

**J: True, True**
