Okay, so I have this optics problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a corrective lens used for a myopic eye. Myopic means nearsighted, right? So the person can see nearby objects clearly but distant ones are blurry. I remember that myopia is corrected with a concave lens, which has a negative refractive power.

The given lens has a refractive power of -10.00 diopters. Wait, diopters are the unit of refractive power, which is the reciprocal of the focal length in meters. So if the power is -10 diopters, that means the focal length is -0.1 meters, or -10 centimeters. Negative because it's a diverging lens, which is used for myopia.

But the question is, what's the effective power when the lens is 12 mm away from the eye? Hmm. I think this has to do with the vertex of the lens and the eye's position. The vertex is the point from which focal length is measured. Normally, the lens is placed such that this vertex is at the eye's principal point, but if the lens is moved away, the effective power changes.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think when the lens isn't placed exactly at the eye's principal point, there's a calculation to adjust the effective power. Oh right, the formula for effective power when the lens is at a distance 'd' from the eye. The formula must account for the position.

I remember that the effective power (P_eff) is given by P_eff = P / (1 + (d * P)/1000), but I'm not entirely sure. Or wait, maybe it's P_eff = P + (d * P^2)/1000 ? Hmm, I might be mixing up the formulas.

Wait, another approach. The focal length of the lens is f = 1/P, right? So for P = -10 diopters, f = -0.1 m = -10 cm. If the lens is moved 12 mm away, which is 1.2 cm, I think the effective focal length changes.

Wait, perhaps the formula is 1/f_eff = 1/f + d, where d is the distance from the lens to the eye in meters. But wait, that doesn't sound right because units wouldn't match. Let me think again.

Wait, I think the correct formula when the lens is at a distance 'd' (in meters) from the eye is:

1/f_eff = 1/f + d

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense dimensionally. Because f is in meters, d is in meters, so 1/f would be 1/m, and adding d which is m would not have compatible units. So I must be wrong.

Wait, maybe it's the other way around. Because the lens is moved away from the eye, the object distance for the lens changes. So perhaps the effective power is adjusted based on the distance. I'm a bit stuck here.

Let me think in terms of the lens formula. The lens formula is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di. But in this case, the object is at a distance that's changed because the lens is moved. Wait, no, in this scenario, the object is at a different position relative to the lens when the lens isn't at the eye's principal point.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. There's a formula for the effective power when the lens is not at the eye's principal point. I think that formula is:

P_eff = P / (1 + (d * P)/1000)

Where d is the distance in millimeters. Let me double-check that.

Wait, I found online that when a lens is placed at a distance d (mm) from the eye, the effective power is given by:

P_eff = P / (1 + (d * P)/1000 )

But I'm not entirely sure if that's correct. Alternatively, I think when the lens is moved away from the eye by a distance 'd', the effective power changes. For a plus lens (which is for hyperopia), moving the lens away would increase the power, but for a minus lens like this one, moving it away would do the opposite.

Wait, another approach. The formula for the effective power when the distance between the eye and the lens is d mm is:

1/f_eff = 1/f + (d/1000) * P

Wait, that might make more sense. Let me test the units. f is in meters, so 1/f is in m^-1. d is in mm, so d/1000 is in meters. P is in diopters, which is m^-1. So (d/1000)*P has units of (m) * (m^-1) ) = unitless. Then 1/f_eff would be in m^-1, which makes sense.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The correct formula I remember is:

1/f_eff = 1/f + d 

where d is the distance in meters. Wait, but that would have conflicting units again. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's:

P_eff = P + (d * P^2)/1000

Yes, I think that's the correct formula. Let me see. P is in diopters (m^-1), d is in millimeters. So d/1000 is in meters. P^2 is (m^-1)^2, so (m^-2). Multiply by d (in meters) gives m*(m^-2) = m^-1, which is diopters. So P_eff would be in diopters.

So the formula would be:

P_eff = P + (d * P^2)/1000

Plugging in the numbers: P = -10.00 diopters, d = 12 mm.

So:

P_eff = (-10) + (12 * (-10)^2)/1000

Calculating step by step:

(-10)^2 = 100.

12 * 100 = 1200.

1200 / 1000 = 1.2.

So,

P_eff = (-10) + (1.2 * (-10)) ?

Wait wait, no. Because (d * P^2) = 12 * (-10)^2 = 12 * 100 = 1200. Then divided by 1000 gives 1.2. So the equation becomes:

P_eff = P + (1.2) 

But wait, P is -10, so:

P_eff = (-10) + 1.2*(-10) ?

Wait, no, the formula is P_eff = P + (d * P^2)/1000.

Wait, no, let me re-express this. The formula is:

P_eff = P + (d * P^2)/1000 

So substituting:

d=12 mm,

P=-10,

P_eff = (-10) + (12 * (-10)^2 ) / 1000

= (-10) + (12 * 100 ) / 1000 

= (-10) + (1200)/1000 

= (-10) + 1.2 

= -8.8 diopters.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see -8.8. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe the formula is 1/f_eff = 1/f - d, where d is in meters. Let's try that.

f = 1/P = 1/(-10) = -0.1 m.

So 1/f_eff = 1/(-0.1) - (12 mm) 

Wait, 12 mm is 0.012 meters.

So 1/f_eff = (-10) - 0.012 = -10.012 m^-1.

So P_eff = -10.012 diopters.

Wait, that's approximately -10.01 diopters. Looking at the options, option I is -10.00, so that's very close. But that doesn't account for much change. So perhaps this isn't the right approach.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is:

The effective power when the lens is moved a distance 'd' from the eye is given by:

P_eff = P / (1 + (d * P) / 1000 )

So let's plug in the numbers.

d = 12 mm.

P = -10.

So,

P_eff = (-10) / [1 + (12 * (-10))/1000 ]

Calculate denominator:

12 * (-10) = -120.

-120 / 1000 = -0.12.

So denominator is 1 - 0.12 = 0.88.

So,

P_eff = (-10)/0.88 = approximately -11.3636 diopters.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options either. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

P_eff = P * (1 + (d * P)/1000 )

Wait, let's try that.

P_eff = (-10) * [1 + (12*(-10))/1000 ]

= (-10) * [1 - 120/1000 ]

= (-10) * (0.88) 

= -8.8 diopters.

Again, that's -8.8, but the options don't have that exactly. The closest option is G: -8.93, but that's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong. Another approach: the effective power accounts for the position by considering the induced prism or something else, but that's probably more advanced.

Wait, I think I found the correct formula. The effective power when the lens is placed at a distance 'd' millimeters from the eye is:

P_eff = P + (d * P^2) / 1000 

So let's recalculate.

P = -10.00, d=12.

P_eff = (-10) + (12 * (-10)^2 ) / 1000

= (-10) + (12 * 100 ) / 1000 

= (-10) + 1200/1000 

= (-10) + 1.2 

= (-10 + 1.2) = -8.8 diopters.

Hmm, but none of the options match exactly. The options are:

A: -11.00

B: -9.50

C: -10.50

D: -9.00

E: -7.93

F: -8.50

G: -8.93

H: -12.00

I: -10.00

J: -7.50

So -8.8 is not there, but option F is -8.50, G is -8.93. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe the formula is different. Another way: the effective power is calculated using the formula:

1/f' = 1/f + (d / 1000)

Wait, that makes sense. Because d is in millimeters, so converting to meters by dividing by 1000.

So f is in meters.

Given P = -10 diopters, so f = 1/P = -0.1 m.

d is 12 mm = 0.012 m.

So 1/f' = 1/(-0.1) + 0.012 

= (-10) + 0.012 = -9.988 m^-1.

Thus, P_eff = -9.988 diopters, approximately -10.00 diopters. That would be option I.

But that seems too minimal a change, considering the lens is moved by 12 mm. Wait, but 12 mm is 1.2 cm, which is significant compared to the focal length of 10 cm. So maybe the change is more noticeable.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is considering the change in image position. Wait, perhaps I should think about the lens formula, considering the object at infinity.

Wait, for a myopic eye, the lens creates a virtual image at the far point of the eye. So when the lens is moved, the image position changes.

Let me think about this. The corrective lens is supposed to take incoming parallel rays (from distant objects) and focus them at the far point of the myopic eye. The far point is the furthest point the eye can see clearly, which for myopia is closer than infinity.

So the lens must create an image at the far point when the object is at infinity.

The far point V is typically taken as the distance from the cornea to the retina, but in this case, perhaps when the lens is moved, the effective power changes.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try another approach. Maybe the formula I should use is the lens-induced myopia formula, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the effective power is P_eff = P + (d * P^2)/1000, as I thought earlier, but let me recalculate.

P_eff = (-10) + (12 * (-10)^2)/1000

= (-10) + (12 * 100)/1000

= (-10) + (1200/1000) 

= (-10) + 1.2 = -8.8.

But that's not an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check:

(12 * (-10)^2) = 12 * 100 = 1200.

1200 / 1000 = 1.2.

So adding to P: -10 + 1.2 = -8.8.

But the options don't have -8.8. So perhaps my formula is wrong.

Wait, maybe the formula is P_eff = P / (1 - (d * P)/1000 )

Let me try that.

P_eff = (-10) / [1 - (12*(-10))/1000 ]

= (-10) / [ 1 - (-120/1000) ]

= (-10) / [1 + 0.12 ]

= (-10) / 1.12 ≈ -8.9286 diopters.

Ah, approximately -8.93 diopters, which is option G.

That makes sense. So the formula must be P_eff = P / (1 - (d*P)/1000 )

Wait, let me double-check the formula derivation. The formula comes from considering the vertex distance. The standard formula for vertex distance 'd' (in mm) is:

P_eff = P / (1 - (d * P)/1000 )

So when d is positive (lens moved away from the eye), this affects the power.

In this case, P is negative, so the denominator becomes 1 - (12*(-10))/1000 = 1 + 0.12 = 1.12.

So P_eff = (-10) / 1.12 ≈ -8.9286, which is approximately -8.93 diopters. So option G.

Yes, that seems right. So the correct answer would be option G.
</think>

To determine the effective power of the corrective lens when it is moved 12 mm away from the eye, we use the formula for vertex distance correction:

\[
P_{\text{eff}} = \frac{P}{1 - \frac{d \cdot P}{1000}}
\]

Here:
- \( P = -10.00 \, \text{diopters} \) (the nominal power of the lens),
- \( d = 12 \, \text{mm} \) (the distance the lens is moved from the eye).

### Step 1: Calculate the denominator
\[
1 - \frac{d \cdot P}{1000} = 1 - \frac{12 \cdot (-10)}{1000}
\]
\[
1 - \frac{-120}{1000} = 1 + 0.12 = 1.12
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the effective power
\[
P_{\text{eff}} = \frac{-10}{1.12} \approx -8.9286 \, \text{diopters}
\]

### Step 3: Match the result to the closest option
The calculated effective power is approximately \(-8.93 \, \text{diopters}\), which corresponds to **option G**.

### Final Answer:
G: \(-8.93 \, \text{diopters}\)

The correct answer is **G**.
