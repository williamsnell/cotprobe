Okay, so I have this problem where I need to compute the mean molecular speed of radon gas. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember it's related to the kinetic theory of gases. I think the formula involves temperature and molar mass. 

Wait, right, the mean molecular speed is given by the root mean square velocity formula. Or wait, is that the same as the average speed? No, maybe I'm confusing the different types of average speeds. Oh right, there's three kinds: v_rms (root mean square), v_avg (average), and v_p (most probable). So the question is asking for v, which is the mean speed, so that's probably the average speed, right?

I think the formula for the average speed is sqrt(8 * R * T / (π * M)), where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and M is the molar mass in kg/mol. But wait, I'm not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, I remember it might be v_avg = sqrt((3RT)/(M)), but wait, no, that's v_rms. Oh wait no, v_rms is sqrt(3RT/M). So wait, I need to get the correct formula.

Let me think again. The average speed is different. Oh right, I think the formula is v_avg = sqrt( (8 R T) / (π M) ), where M is molar mass in kg/mol. So I need to get all the values right.

So first, I need the molar mass of radon. Radon is Rn, and its atomic weight is around 222 grams per mole. Wait, yeah, radon is a noble gas with atomic number 86, and I think its molar mass is approximately 222 g/mol. So converting that to kg/mol, it's 0.222 kg/mol. 

Wait, because 1 kg is 1000 g, so 222 g is 0.222 kg. Right.

Next, the temperature. Oh wait, the problem statement doesn't specify the temperature. Oh wait, that's a problem. Did I miss something? Wait, the question just says "compute the mean molecular speed v in the heavy gas radon (Rn) in m/s". Oh, but usually, when such a problem is given without a temperature, it's assumed to be at standard temperature, which is 0 degrees Celsius or 273.15 K. But sometimes people use 25°C (298 K). Oh wait, but I'm not sure. Hmm, this could affect the answer a lot.

Wait, perhaps I should look for standard conditions. At standard temperature and pressure (STP), which is 0°C and 1 atm. So T=273 K.

Alternatively, maybe the question expects me to use room temperature, which is around 298 K. But without knowing, this is a problem.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with T=300 K as an approximation, or maybe the question expects T=273 K. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a different default temperature. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can proceed with an assumed temperature, and see which of the answer options fits.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check.

So, the root mean square speed is v_rms = sqrt(3RT/M). The average speed is v_avg = sqrt( (8 R T) / (π M) ), and the most probable speed is v_p = sqrt(2 R T / M).

Since the question asks for the mean molecular speed, that's v_avg, the average speed.

So the variables are R, T, and M.

I have R as 8.314 J/(mol·K). Or wait, sometimes R is used as 8.314 or 8.31 or sometimes 8.315, depending on rounding.

So M is 0.222 kg/mol.

Hmmm.

Wait, but let's see. Let's plug in the numbers.

Assuming T is 300 K.

So, R is 8.314 J/(mol·K).

So v_avg = sqrt( (8 * 8.314 * 300) / (π * 0.222) )

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Compute numerator: 8 * 8.314 = approximately 66.512, multiplied by 300 gives 66.512 * 300 = 19,953.6.

Denominator: π * 0.222 ≈ 3.1416 * 0.222 ≈ 0.697.

So the fraction is 19,953.6 / 0.697 ≈ let's compute that.

19953.6 ÷ 0.697 ≈ let's see.

Well, 0.697 times 28,600 is: 0.697 *28000= 19516, which is less than 19953.6. The difference is 19953.6 - 19516 = 437.6.

So 437.6 / 0.697 ≈ approx 628 more.

So total is 28,600 + 628 ≈ 29,228.

So the square root of 29,228 is approximately sqrt(29,228). Let's see, 170^2 is 28,900. 171^2 is 29,241. Oh, wait, 171^2 is 29,241, which is a bit higher than 29,228. So it's approximately 170.8 m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest are option B:167, option J:175, option D:180.

Hmm, but my approximate calculation gives around 170.8 m/s. So none of the options exactly match. But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, or perhaps the temperature is taken as 273 K.

Wait, let me try T=273 K.

So with T=273 K:

Numerator: 8 * 8.314 =66.512; *273 = ?

Compute 66.512 * 273.

Well, 66 * 273 = 18,018. 0.512 *273 ≈ 139.7. So total ≈ 18,018 + 140 = 18,158.

Denominator: π * 0.222 ≈ 0.697.

So fraction is 18,158 / 0.697 ≈ let's compute.

Let me compute 18,158 ÷ 0.697.

Approximately, 0.697 * 26,000 = 18,122. So 26,000 gives 18,122, which is close to 18,158. The difference is 36. So 36/0.697 ≈ 51.65.

So total is 26,000 + 51.65 ≈ 26,051.65.

Square root of 26,051.65 is approximately sqrt(26,051.65). Let's see, 160^2 is 25,600, 161^2 is 25,921. 162^2 is 26,244. So 161.8^2 is around 26,244. So wait, 26,051 is less than that. Let me compute 161^2=25921, so 26051.65 -25921=130.65. So 130.65/(2*161 +1) approximately. Hmm, so maybe around 161 + 130/(2*161) ) ≈ 161 + 130/322 ≈ 161 + 0.4 = 161.4 m/s.

Hmm, but the options don't have 161. So maybe I'm making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different temperature. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the root mean square speed (v_rms) instead of the average speed. Let me try that.

v_rms = sqrt(3 R T / M)

Plugging in T=300 K.

3 *8.314 = 24.942. *300 = 7,482.6.

Divide by M=0.222: 7,482.6 / 0.222 = approx 33,721.6.

Square root of 33,721 is around 183.7 m/s.

Looking at the options, option H is 190, option G is 220, option D is 180. So 183 is close to 180 (option D) but not exact.

But if T is 273 K, let's try that.

v_rms = sqrt( (3 *8.314 *273) / 0.222 )

Compute 3 *8.314 =24.942, *273= approx 24.942 *270= 6734.34, 24.942 *3=74.826 → total 6809.166.

Divide by 0.222: 6809.166 / 0.222 ≈ 30,678.5.

Square root is approx 175.2 m/s. Looking at options, option J is 175, which is close.

Wait, but the question asks for the mean speed, which is v_avg, not v_rms. So maybe I'm using the wrong formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes v_rms as mean speed, but I thought v_avg was the mean speed.

Hmm, this is confusing. So depending on the formula and temperature, I get different answers.

Another thought: wait, what is the molar mass of Radon? I thought it's about 222 g/mol, so 0.222 kg/mol. But let me double-check. Radon's atomic weight is approximately 222, yes. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for R. Like, sometimes R is given as 8.314 J/mol·K, but sometimes as 8.31, or sometimes 8.315, or maybe 8.317. Let's try with R=8.3145.

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses R as 8314 J/(kmol·K), but that's for kilojoules, but in this case, M is in kg/mol, so R should be in J/(mol·K).

Let me try calculating it again more accurately.

Let me try v_avg with T=300 K.

v_avg = sqrt( (8 R T)/(π M) )

Compute numerator: 8 *8.314 *300 = 8 *8.314 =66.512, 66.512 *300=19,953.6 N·m/mol (since J is N·m).

Denominator: π *0.222 ≈ 0.222 *3.14159265 ≈ 0.697.

So 19,953.6 / 0.697 ≈ let's compute this division accurately.

So 0.697 * 28,600 = 0.697 *28,000=19,516; 0.697*600=417.2 → total 19,516+417.2=19,933.2. Subtract from 19,953.6: 19,953.6-19,933.2=20.4.

So 20.4 /0.697 ≈ approx 29.27. So total is 28,600 + 600 + 29.27 ≈ 29,229.27.

Square root of 29,229 is approximately 170.9 m/s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option J:175, but that's higher. Option B is 167, which is lower.

Hmm, but I don't see 170 in the options. So perhaps the temperature is different.

Wait, if the temperature is 298 K (about 25°C), then let's calculate.

v_avg = sqrt( (8 *8.314 *298) / (π * 0.222) )

Compute numerator: 8 *8.314 =66.512, *298 ≈66.512 *300=19,953.6 minus 66.512 *2=133.024 → 19,953.6 -133.024 ≈19,820.576.

Denominator: same as before, 0.697.

So 19,820.576 / 0.697 ≈ Let's see. 0.697 *28,400 = 0.697 *28,000=19,516; 0.697*400=278.8 → total 19,794.8.

Subtract from 19,820.576: 19,820.576 -19,794.8 =25.776.

25.776 /0.697≈37.

So total is 28,400 + 400 +37 =28,837.

Square root of 28,837: sqrt(28,837) is between 169^2=28561 and 170^2=28900. Let's compute 169.8^2: 169^2=28561, 0.8^2=0.64, 2*169*0.8=270.4 → 28561+270.4+0.64≈28832.04. That's higher than 28,837. So perhaps it's around 169.8 - let's see, 28,837 is 28,837 -28561=276 above 169^2. Since each 0.1 increase in x from 169 adds about 33.8 (since 2*169*.1 + 0.1^2 =33.8 +0.01=33.81) per 0.1. So 276/33.8 ≈8.17. So 0.817 increase. So 169 +0.817≈169.817→approx 169.8 m/s.

Still, none of the options are exactly 169.8. So maybe the temperature is 273 K. Let's try that.

Compute v_avg at T=273 K.

Numerator:8 *8.314 *273 = same as before, which was 18,158.4.

Denominator:0.697.

So 18,158.4 /0.697≈26,050.

Square root is around 161.4, as before.

But the options don't have 161.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try using R=8.314 J/mol·K.

Wait, maybe I should calculate it step by step more accurately.

Let me compute v_avg = sqrt( (8 R T) / (π M) )

Where R=8.314, T=300 K, M=0.222 kg/mol.

So 8 *8.314 =66.512.

66.512 *300 =19,953.6.

Denominator: π *0.222=0.222 *3.14159265=0.697.

19,953.6 /0.697 = let's compute this accurately.

Let me compute 0.697 *28,600 =0.697 *28,000=19,516, 0.697*600=417.2 → 19,516 +417.2=19,933.2.

Subtract from 19,953.6: 19,953.6 -19,933.2=20.4.

So 20.4 /0.697 ≈29.27.

So total is 28,600 +29.27=28,629.27.

Square root of 28,629.27: So sqrt(28,629.27). Let's see, 170^2=28,900 → which is higher. 169^2 is 28,561. 

28,629.27 is 28,561 +68.27 → so 68.27/(2*169 +1) → 68.27/339 ≈0.2015. So sqrt ≈169 +0.2=169.2 m/s.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question uses the molar mass in g/mol without converting to kg/mol. Oh wait wait, that's a mistake I might have made. Because M is in kg/mol, right?

Wait, so M is 0.222 kg/mol.

Wait, but if someone mistakenly uses M in g/mol, that would be 222 g/mol = 0.222 kg/mol. Oh, no, that's correct. So that's not the issue.

Wait, perhaps I should check the formula again. Another way to write the formula is v_avg = sqrt( (8 * R * T) / (pi * M) )

Wait, but another approach: maybe using R as 8.314 but in different units. Wait, no, R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the wrong formula, but I don't think so. 

Wait, maybe the question is referring to the root mean square speed, not the average. Let's compute v_rms at T=300 K.

v_rms = sqrt(3 R T / M)

3 *8.314=24.942, *300=7,482.6.

7,482.6 /0.222 =33,721.

sqrt(33,721)= approx 183.7 m/s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D:180, but it's not exact. Option H is 190, which is a bit higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the temperature is 273 K.

v_rms = sqrt(3*8.314*273 /0.222 )

3*8.314=24.942, *273=6,809.166.

6,809.166 /0.222=30,678.5.

sqrt(30,678.5)= approx 175.2 m/s.

Which is very close to option J:175.0.

But wait, the question asks for the mean speed, which is v_avg, not v_rms. But perhaps the options are based on v_rms. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask for v_avg.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the correct formula.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact formula. Let me try to recall: the mean speed (average speed) is indeed given by v_avg = sqrt(8 R T/(pi M)).

So, if I compute that at T=273 K, I get v_avg ≈161 m/s, but there's no option close to that. At T=300 K, I get ≈170 m/s, which isn't an option either. At T=298 K, I get around 169 m/s, again not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question uses a different value for R. For example, sometimes R is given as 8314 J/(kmol·K), but that's for when M is in kg/kmol. Oh wait, no, because M is in kg/mol, R is 8.314 J/(mol·K).

Alternatively, perhaps using R=8.315 for calculation.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the question uses a different value for M. Wait, Radon's molar mass is 222 g/mol, but perhaps there's a mistake. Let me check: Radon's standard atomic weight is approximately 222, yes. So that's correct.

Hmm. This is confusing
