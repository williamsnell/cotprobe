Okay, so I've got this question about transformational leaders and their thinking and outlook. I'm a bit new to this topic, but I remember that transformational leadership is one of the styles we covered in class. Let me try to break this down.

First, I know that leadership styles can be categorized in different ways. There's the transactional approach, which I think is more about exchanging something for something else, like rewards for work done. But transformational leadership is different. I remember hearing that it's more about inspiring and changing the organization.

The question is asking about their thinking and outlook. So, I'm thinking, what do transformational leaders focus on? They probably have a big-picture view because they're trying to bring about significant changes. They might set long-term goals and think strategically about how to achieve them. 

Looking at the options, I see G is Strategic. That makes sense because if they're planning for the future and guiding the organization towards a vision, they must think strategically. Other options don't seem to fit as well. For example, transactional is more about the present and exchanges, so D doesn't fit. Options like operational or procedural (E and F) are more about day-to-day tasks, which doesn't align with the visionary aspect of transformational leaders. 

I also remember that transformational leaders are developmental, which is option J. But wait, developmental is more about developing their team members, right? So maybe that's part of their approach, but the question is about their outlook, which is broader. So strategic thinking (G) seems more accurate.

So putting it all together, transformational leaders have a strategic outlook because they're focused on the long-term vision and guiding their organization towards it.
