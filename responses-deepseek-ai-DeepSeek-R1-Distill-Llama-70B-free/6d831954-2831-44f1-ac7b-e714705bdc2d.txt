Question:

A testator died and through his will gave his entire estate to charity, but the gift failed because the will was executed 10 days prior to the testator's death. A man then filed a claim against the estate, alleging that he was the son and heir of the testator. At the trial on the man's claim, the man was unable to produce any proof of a ceremonial marriage, but established the following by undisputed evidence: (a) that his mother and the testator had cohabited for a number of years; and (b) that his mother had predeceased the testator by one day. Assume that this jurisdiction has a relevant Dead Man's Statute in effect. At trial, the man's attorney called a clerk at a winter resort hotel. The clerk testified that the testator and the man's mother had come to the hotel for many years and he often saw the testator sign the hotel register as "Mr. and Mrs. Testator. "The trial court should rule the clerk's testimony

Options:

A: inadmissible, under the Dead Man's Statute.
B: inadmissible, because it is a violation of the testator's privacy.
C: admissible as a pedigree exception to the hearsay rule.
D: admissible, as it falls under the exception to the hearsay rule for statements of personal or family history.
E: admissible, because it provides evidence of the couple's public recognition as husband and wife.
F: inadmissible, because the clerk's testimony is not the best evidence.
G: inadmissible, because the clerk's testimony is considered hearsay.
H: admissible, as it provides evidence of a common law marriage.
I: admissible, because the clerk had personal knowledge of the matter.
J: inadmissible, as the hotel register is not a legal document establishing marriage.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence question. Let's see what it's about. The scenario is about a testator who died and left his estate to charity, but the will was executed too close to his death, so the gift failed. Now, a man is claiming to be the testator's son and heir. 

In the trial, the man can't produce proof of a ceremonial marriage between his mother and the testator. But he shows that they cohabited for many years and that his mother died just a day before the testator. The jurisdiction has a Dead Man's Statute in effect. 

The man's attorney called a hotel clerk who testified that the testator and the man's mother came to the hotel for many years, and the testator often signed the register as "Mr. and Mrs. Testator." The question is whether this testimony is admissible.

So I need to think about the rules of evidence here. The Dead Man's Statute, which I think is also known as the Deceased Person's Statute, typically prohibits a party from testifying about a personal transaction or communication with the deceased when the opposing party is the deceased's estate or someone claiming under them. But wait, does that apply here? The clerk is testifying about what he saw the testator do, not about a transaction or communication. So maybe the Dead Man's Statute doesn't bar this testimony because the clerk isn't testifying about a personal transaction or communication with the deceased. 

Next, considering hearsay. The clerk's testimony is about the testator signing the register a certain way. That's an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter (that they were husband and wife). So it's hearsay unless an exception applies.

Looking at the hearsay exceptions, there's the exception for statements concerning personal or family history. I think that's covered under Federal Rule 803(9), which allows statements of fact concerning the declarant's personal history or family history, which are not so ancient as to be beyond the reach of verification. The testator's signing as "Mr. and Mrs." could be a statement about their marital status, which is a family history fact. 

Alternatively, there's the pedigree exception, which allows evidence about family history, like marriage, provided it's not based on hearsay within hearsay. But the clerk is testifying directly about what he observed, so it's not hearsay in that sense. Wait, no, the clerk is recounting the testator's statement, so it's actually hearsay. So the question is whether it falls under an exception.

Another angle is whether the testimony is about reputation or opinion on family history. But the clerk's testimony is about specific instances, not reputation, so that might not fit.

Wait, but in this case, the testator's act of signing "Mr. and Mrs." is being offered to show that they held themselves out as married. That could be admissible as evidence of their marital status, which is relevant to the man's claim of being the testator's son. 

Also, the best evidence rule might come into play. The clerk is testifying about the content of the hotel register. The best evidence rule says that the original writing should be produced if the content is in question. But here, the testimony is about what the clerk saw the testator write, not about the content of the register itself. So maybe the best evidence rule doesn't apply because the testimony is about the act of signing, not the content of the document. So option F, which says it's inadmissible because it's not the best evidence, might not be correct.

Looking at the options:

Option E says it's admissible because it provides evidence of the couple's public recognition as husband and wife. That sounds plausible because it's about their reputation or holding out.

Option D says it's admissible under the exception for statements of personal or family history. That could fit because the testator's statement on the register is about their marital status, a family history fact.

Option G says it's inadmissible as hearsay. But if it falls under an exception, then G is incorrect.

Option C is about pedigree exception. I'm not sure if that applies here because the clerk isn't a family member or someone with knowledge of the family history.

Option I says it's admissible because the clerk had personal knowledge. Well, the clerk does have personal knowledge of seeing the testator sign, so that's a good point. But the issue is whether the statement is hearsay and whether an exception applies.

So putting it together: The clerk's testimony is hearsay because it's the testator's out-of-court statement offered for the truth. But it might fall under the family history exception. Alternatively, it's admissible as evidence of their reputation or holding out as married.

Wait, another thought: The testator's statement on the register is a statement about their marital status. If the testator is deceased, and the testimony is about a personal history fact, then under 803(9), it's admissible. So that would align with option D.

Alternatively, option E says it's about public recognition. That's more about reputation, which is a different exception, perhaps under 803(21) for reputation as to marriage.

Wait, let me think about the hearsay exceptions again. 803(9) allows statements of fact concerning personal history or family history, which are not too ancient. The testator's signing as "Mr. and Mrs." is a statement about their marital status, so it's a family history fact. So under 803(9), it's admissible.

Alternatively, if the testimony is about the testator's reputation in the community as being married, that would be a different exception, but here the clerk is testifying about specific acts (signing the register), not general reputation.

So which exception applies? The clerk's testimony is about the testator's own statements, so it's hearsay. But under 803(9), statements about family history are admissible. So option D would be correct.

Wait, but option E is about public recognition, which might be more about how others viewed them, not necessarily their own statements. So perhaps E is about reputation, which is a different exception.

Alternatively, the testimony could be admissible as evidence of a common law marriage, but I'm not sure if the jurisdiction recognizes that, and the question doesn't specify.

So, considering all this, the testimony is hearsay but falls under the exception for statements of personal or family history, making option D correct. Or maybe option E is correct because it's about their public recognition.

Wait, but option E says it's admissible because it provides evidence of the couple's public recognition as husband and wife. That sounds more like reputation evidence, which would fall under a different exception. But the clerk's testimony is about the testator's own statements, not what others thought.

So perhaps the better fit is option D, as it's a statement about their personal history.

But I'm a bit confused between D and E. Let me think again.

Option D: admissible as statements of personal or family history.

Option E: admissible because it's evidence of public recognition.

The testimony is about the testator's own actions, not others' opinions. So it's about the testator's statement, which is hearsay but falls under 803(9). So D is correct.

Wait, but 803(9) is about a statement concerning the declarant's personal or family history. The declarant here is the testator, so his statement about being married is a family history fact. So yes, D applies.

So the answer should be D.

Wait, but another thought: The Dead Man's Statute. The clerk is testifying about the testator's actions. The Dead Man's Statute typically applies when a party is testifying about a transaction with the deceased. But the clerk isn't a party, so maybe the statute doesn't apply. So option A is incorrect.

So putting it all together, the testimony is admissible under the exception for personal or family history, so option D is correct.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a hotel clerk's testimony regarding a testator's practice of signing a hotel register as "Mr. and Mrs. Testator." The man claiming to be the testator's son is attempting to prove his relationship to the testator, and the clerk's testimony is offered as evidence of the testator's marital status and relationship with the man's mother. The analysis focuses on the Dead Man's Statute, hearsay, and applicable exceptions to the hearsay rule.

1. **Dead Man's Statute**: This statute generally prohibits a party from testifying about personal transactions or communications with the deceased when the opposing party is the deceased's estate or someone claiming under them. However, the clerk is not a party and is testifying about the testator's actions, not a personal transaction or communication. Therefore, the Dead Man's Statute does not bar this testimony.

2. **Hearsay and Exceptions**: The clerk's testimony is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter (that the testator and the man's mother were husband and wife), making it hearsay. However, hearsay exceptions must be considered:
   - **Statements of Personal or Family History (Option D)**: Under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(9), statements of fact concerning the declarant's personal or family history are admissible if they are not too ancient to be verified. The testator's act of signing the register as "Mr. and Mrs. Testator" qualifies as a statement about his marital status, a family history fact. This exception applies, making the testimony admissible.
   - **Public Recognition (Option E)**: While the testimony could also be interpreted as evidence of the couple's public recognition as husband and wife, this is more aligned with reputation evidence under a different exception. The clerk's testimony specifically concerns the testator's own statements, not community reputation.

3. **Best Evidence Rule (Option F)**: The best evidence rule requires the original document when the content of a writing is at issue. Here, the testimony is about the testator's act of signing the register, not the content of the register itself. Thus, the best evidence rule does not apply.

4. **Other Options**: 
   - **Option G**: Incorrect because the testimony falls under a hearsay exception.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect because the pedigree exception does not apply here.
   - **Option I**: While the clerk has personal knowledge, the issue is whether the testimony is hearsay and whether an exception applies.
   - **Option H and J**: Incorrect because the testimony does not establish a common law marriage or rely on the hotel register as a legal document.

The testimony is admissible under the exception for statements of personal or family history.
