Okay, so I have this probability problem here about the lifetime of a device with three components. The question is about finding the probability that the device fails in the first hour. Hmm, I need to think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the device fails when any one of the components fails. Since the components are independent, the probability that the device fails is related to the probability that at least one component fails.

The pdf given is f(x) = (2x / 10²) e^{-(x/10)^2} for x > 0. I think this is a Rayleigh distribution. Right, because the Rayleigh distribution has the pdf f(x) = (x/σ²) e^{-x²/(2σ²)}, but wait, in this case, the denominator in the exponent is (x/10)^2 without the 2. So maybe it's a different form, but I can work with it.

The key here is to find the probability that the device fails in the first hour, which is the probability that at least one component fails in the first hour. Since the device stops working when any component fails, the failure time of the device is the minimum of the three components' lifetimes.

So, the probability that the device fails in the first hour is equal to P(Y ≤ 1), where Y is the minimum of the three lifetimes. Since all components are independent, I can use the formula that P(Y ≤ y) = 1 - P(all components > y). That's the hint provided too.

So, P(Y ≤ 1) = 1 - [P(X > 1)]^3, because each component has the same distribution and they're independent.

Now, I need to find P(X >1 ), which is the probability that a single component's lifetime exceeds 1 hour. To find this, I can integrate the pdf from 1 to infinity. But wait, maybe there's a smarter way since integrating might be tricky.

Wait, the pdf given is f(x) = (2x)/(10^2) e^{-(x/10)^2}. Let's see, the integral of f(x) from 0 to x is the CDF, F(x) = P(X ≤ x). So, P(X >1 ) is 1 - F(1).

So, F(1) is the integral from 0 to 1 of (2x/100) e^{-(x²/100)} dx. Let me compute that integral.

Let me make a substitution. Let u = (x²)/(100). Then du/dx = (2x)/(100). So, du = (2x/100) dx. That means (2x/100) dx = du. So the integral becomes ∫ from u=0 to u=(1/100) of e^{-u} du. Because when x=1, u=(1)^2/100 = 1/100.

The integral of e^{-u} du from 0 to a is [ -e^{-u} ] from 0 to a, which is (1 - e^{-a} ). So here, a is 1/100.

So F(1) = 1 - e^{-(1/100)}.

Wait, wait. Let me check the substitution again. The integral is ∫ (2x/100) e^{-(x²/100)} dx from 0 to 1. With substitution u = x²/100, du = (2x/100) dx. So yes, the integral becomes ∫ e^{-u} du from 0 to 1/100. Which is [ -e^{-u} ] from 0 to 1/100. So that's ( -e^{-1/100} ) - ( -1 ), which is 1 - e^{-1/100}.

So F(1) = 1 - e^{-0.01}. Therefore, P(X>1) = 1 - F(1) = e^{-0.01}.

Wait, wait a second. That can't be right. Because F(1) is P(X ≤1), so P(X>1) = 1 - F(1) = 1 - [1 - e^{-0.01}] = e^{-0.01}.

Yes, that's correct. So [P(X>1)]^3 = [e^{-0.01}]^3 = e^{-0.03}.

So the probability that the device fails in the first hour is 1 - e^{-0.03}.

Now I need to compute 1 - e^{-0.03}. Let's calculate e^{-0.03} approximately. I know that e^{-x} ≈ 1 - x + x²/2 - x^3/6 for small x. Since 0.03 is small, this approximation should be reasonable.

So e^{-0.03} ≈ 1 - 0.03 + (0.03)^2 /2 - (0.03)^3 /6.

Let me compute each term:

1st term: 1

2nd term: -0.03 → 0.97

3rd term: (0.0009)/2 = 0.00045 → 0.97 + 0.00045 = 0.97045

4th term: -(0.000027)/6 ≈ -0.0000045 → 0.97045 - 0.0000045 ≈ 0.9704455

So e^{-0.03} ≈ 0.9704455.

So 1 - e^{-0.03} ≈ 1 - 0.9704455 = 0.0295545, which is approximately 0.02955, or about 0.03.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.03. So the answer should be C.

But wait, let me double-check the integral substitution just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The substitution was u = x² / 100, du = (2x dx)/100. So when x=0, u=0; x=1, u=0.01.

So the integral ∫0^1 (2x/100) e^{-(x²/100)} dx becomes ∫0^{0.01} e^{-u} du. Which is correct. So F(1) is 1 - e^{-0.01}, so P(X>1) is e^{-0.01}.

Wait, wait a minute! Hold on. Because in the substitution, the integral becomes ∫ e^{-u} du from 0 to 0.01. Which is 1 - e^{-0.01}, but that's F(1)=P(X<=1) = 1 - e^{-0.01}.

So P(X>1) is e^{-0.01}. So [P(X>1)]^3 = e^{-0.03}.

So the device's failure probability up to 1 hour is 1 - e^{-0.03}.

Calculating that again: 0.03 is 3% of an hour. Let me compute e^{-0.03} more accurately.

I can use a calculator, but since I don't have one here, perhaps a better approximation can be done.

Alternatively, I can use the expansion e^{-x} ≈ 1 - x + x²/2 - x^3/6 + x^4/24.

So for x=0.03:

e^{-0.03} ≈ 1 - 0.03 + (0.03)^2/2 - (0.03)^3/6 + (0.03)^4/24.

Compute each term:

1 → 1

-0.03 → 0.97

+ (0.0009)/2 → 0.00045 → total 0.97045

- (0.000027)/6 → approximately 0.0000045 → 0.9704455

+ (0.00000081)/24 → about 0.0000000338 → 0.9704455338.

So 1 - e^{-0.03} is approximately 0.029554467.

So that's about 0.02955, which is 0.03 when rounded to two decimal places.

Looking back at the options, option C is 0.03. So the correct answer should be option C.

To determine the probability that the device fails in the first hour of operation, we start by noting that the device fails when any one of its three components fails. The lifetimes of the components are independent and follow the given pdf:

$$
f(x) = \frac{2x}{10^2} e^{-(x/10)^2}, \quad 0 < x < \infty.
$$

The probability that the device fails in the first hour is equivalent to the probability that the minimum lifetime of the three components is less than or equal to 1 hour. This can be expressed as:

$$
P(Y \leq 1) = 1 - P(Y > 1),
$$

where $Y$ is the minimum of the three lifetimes. Since the components are independent, $P(Y > 1)$ is the probability that all three components survive beyond 1 hour:

$$
P(Y > 1) = [P(X > 1)]^3,
$$

where $P(X > 1)$ is the probability that a single component survives beyond 1 hour. To compute $P(X > 1)$, we first find the CDF of $X$ at $x = 1$, $F(1)$, which is given by:

$$
F(1) = \int_0^1 \frac{2x}{10^2} e^{-(x/10)^2} dx.
$$

Using the substitution $u = (x/10)^2$, $du = (2x/100) dx$, the integral simplifies to:

$$
F(1) = \int_0^{0.01} e^{-u} du = 1 - e^{-0.01}.
$$

Thus, $P(X > 1) = 1 - F(1) = e^{-0.01}$. Substituting this into $P(Y > 1)$, we get:

$$
P(Y > 1) = [e^{-0.01}]^3 = e^{-0.03}.
$$

The probability that the device fails in the first hour is therefore:

$$
P(Y \leq 1) = 1 - e^{-0.03}.
$$

To approximate $1 - e^{-0.03}$, we use the Taylor expansion of $e^{-x}$ for small $x$:

$$
e^{-x} \approx 1 - x + \frac{x^2}{2} - \frac{x^3}{6}.
$$

For $x = 0.03$:

$$
e^{-0.03} \approx 1 - 0.03 + \frac{(0.03)^2}{2} - \frac{(0.03)^3}{6}.
$$

Computing each term:

- $1 - 0.03 = 0.97$
- $\frac{(0.03)^2}{2} = 0.00045 \implies 0.97 + 0.00045 = 0.97045$
- $\frac{(0.03)^3}{6} = 0.0000045 \implies 0.97045 - 0.0000045 = 0.9704455$

Thus, $e^{-0.03} \approx 0.9704455$, and:

$$
1 - e^{-0.03} \approx 1 - 0.9704455 = 0.0295545.
$$

This is approximately $0.03$ when rounded to two decimal places. Comparing this result to the provided options, the correct answer is:

**C: 0.03**
