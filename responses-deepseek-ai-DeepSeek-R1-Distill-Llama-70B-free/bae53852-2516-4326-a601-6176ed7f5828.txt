Okay, so I've got this transformer efficiency problem to solve. Hmm, I remember that transformer efficiency depends on both iron losses and copper losses. Let me see. The question says it's a 5 kVA transformer. So the rating is 5 kilovolt-amperes.

The load varies during the day. It operates at full load for 1 hour, half load for 1.5 hours, and no load for the rest of the time. Wait, what's the total time we're considering? Oh, I think it's a normal day, so maybe 24 hours? So the transformer is loaded for 1 + 1.5 = 2.5 hours and unloaded for 21.5 hours? But wait, the problem says during the rest of the day, so I think the total time is 24 hours, but I should confirm. Well, the way it's phrased says that apart from those 1 and 1.5 hours, the rest of the day has no load. So yes, 24 hours in total.

Iron loss is given as 200 watts. Iron loss is also known as core loss, and it's constant whenever the transformer is energized, right? So whether the transformer is loaded or not, if it's on, the iron loss occurs. So for all 24 hours, the iron loss is 200 W.

Copper loss is the I²R loss in the windings. At full load, this is 200 W. So when the transformer is at full load, copper loss is 200 W. At half load, the current is halved, so the copper loss would be (0.5)^2 times the full load value. So that's 0.25 * 200 = 50 W. Oh wait, because copper loss depends on the square of the current.

But wait, the transformer is only under load for 2.5 hours. So for the remaining 21.5 hours, since there's no load, the copper loss is zero. Because I is zero, so I²R is zero. But wait, is the transformer even energized during those 21.5 hours? Because if it's not connected to the power source, then both iron and copper losses would be zero. Hmm, the question says there's no load, but does it mean it's still energized? Or is it switched off?

Wait, the question says 'during the rest of the day there would be no load on the transformer.' So I think it's still connected, just not supplying any current. So iron loss happens whenever it's energized. So for all 24 hours, iron loss is 200 W. But copper loss only happens when current flows, which is during the loaded times.

So let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the output (kWh) during the loaded periods.
2. Calculate the total losses (iron and copper) during the entire day.
3. Efficiency is (output / (output + losses)).

Wait, but efficiency is usually the ratio of output to input. So input is output plus losses. So efficiency = (output) / (output + losses).

Wait, but all-day efficiency is the useful output divided by the total energy consumed, which includes the losses. So yes, that's correct.

So first, find the output. The transformer is supplying a load for 1 hour at full load and 1.5 hours at half load.

What's the full load kVA? 5 kVA. So the output in kW would depend on the power factor. But wait, the problem doesn't mention power factor. Hmm, this is a bit of a problem. I think in such cases, it's often assumed that the load is resistive, so power factor is 1. So kW = kVA * pf = 5 kW at full load.

Wait, but the question says it's a lighting load. Lighting loads are typically resistive, so yes, pf is 1. So at full load, the output is 5 kW. At half load, it's 2.5 kW.

So the output energy (kWh) is:

Full load: 5 kW * 1 h = 5 kWh
Half load: 2.5 kW * 1.5 h = 3.75 kWh
Total output = 5 + 3.75 = 8.75 kWh

Wait, but wait! Transformers are AC devices, and the output in watts would be VA * power factor. But since it's a lighting load and pf is 1, it's correct to take output as 5 kW at full load.

Next, the losses. There are iron losses and copper losses.

Iron losses are 200 W all the time, for 24 hours. So iron loss energy is 200 W * 24 h = 4800 Wh = 4.8 kWh.

Copper losses occur only when current flows, which is for 2.5 hours. Let's calculate the copper loss during each loaded period.

Full load: 200 W for 1 hour → 0.2 kWh
Half load: (0.5)^2 * 200 W = 50 W for 1.5 hours → 50 * 1.5 = 75 Wh → 0.075 kWh
Total copper loss = 0.2 + 0.075 = 0.275 kWh

So total losses (iron + copper) = 4.8 + 0.275 = 5.075 kWh

So total output is 8.75 kWh, and total input is output + losses = 8.75 +5.075 = 13.825 kWh.

Efficiency η = (output / input) * 100 = (8.75 / 13.825) *100

Let me calculate that.

8.75 ÷ 13.825 ≈ 0.6329, so 63.29%, approximately.

Wait, but the options are A:75%, B:90%, C:80%, D:68.5%.

Hmm, 63.29% isn't among them. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the copper loss calculation. Let me recheck.

Full load copper loss is 200 W for 1 hour: 200 *1 = 200 Wh.

Half load is 50 W (since (0.5)^2=0.25, 0.25*200=50 W) for 1.5 hours: 50 * 1.5 =75 Wh. So total copper is 275 Wh, 0.275 kWh.

Iron loss is 200 W *24h = 4800 Wh, 4.8 kWh.

Total losses: 4800 + 275 = 5075 Wh = 5.075 kWh.

Output is 8.75 kWh.

So efficiency is 8.75 / (8.75+5.075) = 8.75 /13.825 ≈ 0.6329 → 63.29%. But the closest option is D:68.5%.

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the way I'm calculating the output or the losses.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the transformer's output is calculated in kVA, but perhaps it's not exactly 5 kW because of some other factors. No, wait, earlier I assumed that the load is purely resistive, so 5 kVA * 1 pf =5 kW. That seems right.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the efficiency as (output) / (input) where input is output plus losses, but maybe I should compute the output and input in terms of kWh for each time period. Let me try that.

Full load period (1h):
Output =5 kWh
Input =5 kWh + 0.2 kWh (copper) + (for 1h, iron loss is 0.2 kWh? Wait no, iron loss is 200 W for 24h, so per hour it's 0.2 kWh.)

Wait, no, that's not correct. The iron loss is 200 W, so in one hour it's 0.2 kWh, but during the full load hour, the iron loss is 0.2 kWh, and copper loss is 0.2 kWh. So input during that hour is 5 + 0.2 +0.2 =5.4 kWh.

Wait, no, because input is the sum of output and all losses during that hour. So during the full load hour: output is 5 kWh, copper loss 0.2 kWh, iron loss 0.2 kWh. So input is 5 +0.2+0.2 =5.4 kWh.

Similarly, during the half load period of 1.5 hours:

Output is 2.5 kW * 1.5 h = 3.75 kWh.

Copper loss is 50 W *1.5 h=75 Wh=0.075 kWh.

Iron loss is 200 W *1.5 h= 300 Wh=0.3 kWh.

So input during half load is 3.75 +0.075 +0.3 =4.125 kWh.

Wait no, wait. Iron loss is 200 W all the time, so during any hour, it's 0.2 kWh. So for the 1.5 hours, it's 0.2 *1.5=0.3 kWh.

So during the 1h full load:

Input = output + copper + iron for that hour.

So input for 1h:5 +0.2+0.2=5.4 kWh.

For 1.5h half load:

Output is 3.75 kWh.

Copper loss:0.075 kWh.

Iron loss:0.3 kWh.

So input for 1.5h: 3.75 +0.075 +0.3=4.125 kWh.

Then, for the remaining 21.5 hours, output is zero, but iron loss is 200 W *21.5h = 4300 Wh=4.3 kWh. No copper loss during these times.

So total input is 5.4 +4.125 +4.3 =13.825 kWh.

Total output is 5 +3.75=8.75 kWh.

So efficiency is 8.75 /13.825= approx 63.29%. Still not matching the options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to compute the efficiency for each time period and then find an average? But that doesn't seem right. Or perhaps the way I'm handling iron loss is wrong.

Wait another thing: Maybe the copper loss during the 1.5 hours is calculated differently. Let's think. At half load, the current is half, so copper loss is (I^2 R) → (0.5 I_full)^2 R → 0.25 (I_full^2 R) → 0.25 * 200 W=50 W. So for 1.5 hours, that's 75 Wh, which is correct as before.

Wait, but perhaps the total copper loss is calculated as (I1^2 R * t1) + (I2^2 R * t2). So I think that's what I did.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering only the loaded periods for the efficiency, but I don't think so. Efficiency is for the entire period, including all losses.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the way I'm summing the inputs. Let me re-calculate.

Total output is 8.75 kWh.

Total losses:

Iron loss: 200 W *24h = 4800 Wh =4.8 kWh.

Copper loss: during 1h, 200 W → 200 Wh.

During 1.5h, 50 W → 75 Wh.

Total copper: 275 Wh → 0.275 kWh.

Total losses: 4.8 + 0.275 =5.075 kWh.

So input is 8.75 +5.075 =13.825 kWh.

Efficiency is 8.75 /13.825 → let me compute this exactly.

8.75 ÷13.825 → Let's see, 13.825 × 0.63 = approx 8.71. So 0.63 approx. So 63%.

But the options don't have 63%. The closest is option D:68.5%.

So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation. Let me try to compute the exact value.

Compute 8.75 /13.825.

Compute 13.825 × 0.6329 = approx 8.75?

Wait, 0.6329 *13.825 = ?

Let me compute 8.75 /13.825.

Let me compute 8.75 ÷13.825.

I can write it as 8750 ÷13825.

Simplify numerator and denominator by dividing by 25:

8750 ÷25=350; 13825 ÷25=553.

So 350/553. Let's compute this as a decimal.

553 ×0.63 = 553 *0.6=331.8; 553 *0.03=16.59 → total 348.39. So 0.63 is 553 *0.63=348.39. 350 is a bit higher, so the value is approximately 0.63 + (1.61/553) → 1.61/553 ≈0.0029. So approx 0.6329, which is 63.29%.

So about 63.3% efficiency. Not matching any of the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumptions.

Wait, perhaps the iron loss is given per day, not per hour? No, the question says iron loss is 200 watts, which is a power. So it's 200 W all the time. So per day, it's 200 *24 =4800 Wh.

Wait another thought: Maybe the transformer isn't energized all the time. Like, it's only on when there's a load. So during the 21.5 hours of no load, the transformer is switched off, so no iron loss during that time.

Wait, but the question says "during the rest of the day there would be no load on the transformer." So does that mean it's still energized with no load? Or is it turned off?

If it's turned off, then iron loss occurs only during the loaded times.

Let me recalculate that scenario.

If the transformer operates for 2.5 hours (1 +1.5) and is off for 21.5 hours.

Iron loss is 200 W only when it's on, so for 2.5 hours: 200 *2.5=500 Wh=0.5 kWh.

Copper loss: same as before, 0.275 kWh.

So total losses: 0.5 + 0.275=0.775 kWh.

Output is 8.75 kWh.

Efficiency: 8.75 / (8.75 +0.775 )=8.75/9.525≈0.9185, which is 91.85%. But options don't have that. Hmm, that's way higher, and option B is 90%.

But the question states, "during the rest of the day there would be no load on the transformer." It doesn't explicitly say whether it's switched off or just idling. Hmm, in real scenarios, transformers are usually left energized, but perhaps sometimes they're switched off when not needed.

If the transformer is off, then the iron loss only happens for 2.5 hours. But I'm not sure. The problem isn't clear. If I proceed with this, the efficiency would be about 91.8%, which is close to option B:90%. But that's a big assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to calculate the average efficiency over the operating periods, but that's not correct because all-day efficiency accounts for all the time.

Wait, let me check the question again. It says, "the all-day efficiency of the transformer." So all-day implies over the entire 24 hours, including when it's not loaded.

So I think the initial approach is correct: iron loss is 200 W for 24h, copper loss is 275 Wh.

So 63.29% efficiency. But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the output calculation.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the output is calculated differently because the transformer's output is in kVA, but perhaps the actual power (kW) is less due to power factor. Wait, but earlier I assumed pf=1. Let me recheck.

The load is a lighting load, which is resistive, so pf=1. So output is 5 kW at full load. So that's correct.

Wait, another thing: Maybe the copper loss at half load is calculated differently. Let me see: Full load current is I, so copper loss is I² R =200 W. At half load, current is I/2, so copper loss is (I² R)/4=200/4=50 W. So that's correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the iron loss only when the transformer is under load. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because iron loss is due to the core being magnetized, which happens whenever the transformer is connected to the supply, regardless of the load. So if it's connected all day, iron loss is 200 W *24h.

But maybe the transformer is only connected during the loaded times. So it's only on for 2.5 hours, thus iron loss is 200 *2.5=500 Wh. Then total losses:500 +275=775 Wh.

Output:8.75 kWh.

Efficiency= 8.75/(8.75+0.775) =8.75/9.525≈91.8%. But again, the options don't have this.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the efficiency differently, considering only the time when the transformer is loaded. But that's not all-day efficiency.

I think I must have made a mistake in the initial approach, but I can't see where. Let's try another approach.

Wait, perhaps the all-day efficiency is calculated as (total output in kWh) / (total input in kWh), where input is sum of output and losses.

So output is 8.75 kWh.

Losses: iron loss is 200 W *24h=4800 Wh=4.8 kWh.

Copper loss: (I1² R * t1) + (I2² R * t2).

I1 is full load current, I2 is half load.

I1² R=200 W. So for t1=1h, it's 200 Wh.

I2=0.5 I1 → I2² R=0.25 *200=50 W. For t2=1.5h, 75 Wh.

Total copper loss=200 +75=275 Wh=0.275 kWh.

Total losses=4.8 +0.275=5.075 kWh.

So input=8.75 +5.075=13.825 kWh.

Efficiency=8.75/13.825= approx 63.3%, which is not in the options.

Wait, perhaps the question uses a different definition, like average efficiency or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I've miscalculated the output.

Wait,
