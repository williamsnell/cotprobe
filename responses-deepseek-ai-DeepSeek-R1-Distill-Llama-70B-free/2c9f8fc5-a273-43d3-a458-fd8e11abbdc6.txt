B: The Classical Economists
C: The Neoclassical Economists
D: The Mercantilists
E: The Chicago School of Economics

I: The Monetarists

Okay, so I have this question about different schools of economists and their views on government intervention. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

The question is asking which school of economists traditionally supports government intervention for two reasons: affecting the level of economic activity and redistributing resources, like from the rich to the poor. The options are A through I, each representing a different school.

I remember that Keynesian economists are big on government intervention, especially during economic downturns. They believe that the government should step in to stimulate the economy through spending and fiscal policies. So that covers the first part about affecting economic activity. But what about redistribution? Keynesians might support some redistribution because their policies often include measures that help lower-income groups, like creating jobs or social programs. So that could fit both reasons.

Let me think about the other options. Supply-side economists (A) focus more on tax cuts and incentives to encourage production. They don't really emphasize redistribution. Classical economists (B) and Neoclassicals (C) usually support laissez-faire, meaning minimal government intervention. So they probably don't fit.

Mercantilists (D) are more about trade balances and state control over the economy for power, not so much about redistribution. The Chicago School (E) is associated with free-market ideas and might oppose a lot of government intervention beyond what's necessary for markets to function.

Institutional economists (F) look at how institutions and social factors influence the economy. They might support some intervention, but I'm not sure if it's specifically for both activity and redistribution as a traditional stance.

Austrian School (H) is very much against government intervention, advocating for free markets and minimal state involvement. So that's probably not it. Monetarists (I), led by Milton Friedman, focus on monetary policy and controlling the money supply. They might support some government intervention in monetary terms but are generally skeptical of fiscal policies and large-scale redistribution.

Putting it all together, the Keynesians (G) seem to be the best fit here because they support government intervention both to manage economic activity and to redistribute resources through policies like progressive taxation and social spending.

The Keynesians have traditionally supported government intervention for both affecting the level of economic activity and redistributing resources. They advocate for fiscal policies to stimulate the economy during downturns and often support measures that benefit lower-income groups, aligning with the two reasons provided in the question.
