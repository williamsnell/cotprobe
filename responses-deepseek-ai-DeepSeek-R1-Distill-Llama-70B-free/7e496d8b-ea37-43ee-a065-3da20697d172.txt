Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about what a value-added tax is, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that a value-added tax, or VAT, is a type of tax that's related to the value added to goods and services as they move through the production and distribution process. I think it's not a tax on just one part of the product, like raw materials, but rather on each stage where value is added.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's a tax only on raw materials. That doesn't sound right because VAT isn't limited to just raw materials. It's applied at each stage, including manufacturing, wholesale, and retail.

Option B mentions it's imposed only on luxury items at the point of sale. I don't think that's correct because VAT usually applies to a broad range of goods and services, not just luxury items. Also, VAT is collected at multiple points, not just at the final sale.

Option C says it's a tax deducted from total sales revenue. That doesn't seem accurate because VAT isn't a direct tax on the company's total sales. Instead, it's charged on the value added at each stage, and the businesses can claim back the VAT they've paid on their inputs.

Option D talks about a progressive tax on corporate profits. VAT isn't a profit tax; it's a consumption tax. So D is probably not the right answer.

Option E states it's a tax on the final selling price. While the final consumer does pay VAT, the tax is actually collected at each stage, not just the final sale. So E might not capture the whole picture.

Option F describes it as a sales tax applied uniformly at a single stage. Wait, no. VAT is applied at multiple stages, not just one. So F is incorrect.

Option G refers to a tax only on imported goods. That's more like a customs duty or tariff. VAT applies to both imported and domestically produced goods, so G isn't right.

Option H is about a flat-rate income tax. That's unrelated to VAT, which is a consumption tax, not an income tax.

Option I says it's collected at each stage based on the value added. That rings a bell. VAT is levied at each production and distribution stage, on the value added at that point. So each business in the chain pays tax on their value addition, and they can reclaim the VAT paid on their inputs. This makes I a strong candidate.

Option J mentions a tax on the total value of a product. That sounds more like a sales tax, which is a single-stage tax on the total price. VAT is different because it's applied incrementally at each stage.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be Option I.

A value-added tax (VAT) is a consumption tax applied at each stage of production and distribution, based on the value added to goods and services at each stage. It is not limited to raw materials, luxury items, or the final sale, nor is it a tax on profits or income. Instead, it is collected incrementally as value is added, and businesses can reclaim the VAT paid on their inputs.

The correct answer is:

I: A tax collected at each stage of production based on the value added.

Answer: I
