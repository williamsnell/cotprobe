Okay, so I've got this question about gluconeogenesis and which amino acid can't be a substrate for it. Hmm, I need to think through this carefully. I remember that gluconeogenesis is the process by which the body makes glucose from non-carbohydrate sources, like amino acids, lactate, and glycerol.

First, I should probably list out the amino acids given and see if I remember which ones are glucogenic. Glucogenic amino acids can be converted into glucose through gluconeogenesis. Alternatively, some are purely ketogenic, meaning they can be turned into ketone bodies but not glucose. But wait, most amino acids are either glucogenic or have both properties.

Let's go through each option:

A: Tryptophan. I think tryptophan is both glucogenic and ketogenic. Because part of its structure can go into the citric acid cycle to produce intermediates that can be used for gluconeogenesis.

B: Methionine. Methionine is a glucogenic amino acid, I believe. It's converted into succinyl-CoA, which can enter the citric acid cycle and contribute to making glucose.

C: Alanine. Alanine is definitely glucogenic. It's converted into pyruvate, which can be a substrate for gluconeogenesis. I remember that alanine is a major gluconeogenic amino acid, especially after muscle breakdown.

D: Glutamine. Glutamine is interesting. I think it's glucogenic because it can be converted into glutamate, then into alpha-ketoglutarate, which is a TCA cycle intermediate. So that can contribute to making glucose.

E: Isoleucine. Isoleucine is a branched-chain amino acid. I recall that it's both glucogenic and ketogenic. It breaks down into acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA. The propionyl part can go into the TCA cycle to make succinyl-CoA, which is glucogenic.

F: Histidine. Histidine is glucogenic. It breaks down into alpha-ketoglutarate, which is part of the TCA cycle and can be used for gluconeogenesis.

G: Threonine. Threonine is glucogenic. It can be converted into glucose via intermediates like glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.

H: Arginine. Arginine is glucogenic. Through the urea cycle, it's converted into alpha-ketoglutarate, which can be used in gluconeogenesis.

I: Leucine. Oh wait, leucine is a purely ketogenic amino acid. It's broken down into acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate, which can't be used to make glucose. So if that's the case, leucine can't be a substrate for gluconeogenesis.

J: Valine. Valine is glucogenic. It breaks down into succinyl-CoA, which is part of the TCA cycle and can support gluconeogenesis.

Wait, so the question is which amino acid cannot provide a substrate. So from this, option I is leucine, which is purely ketogenic. So the correct answer would be I (Leucine).

To determine which amino acid cannot provide a substrate for gluconeogenesis, we analyze the given options:

- **A: Tryptophan** – Both glucogenic and ketogenic. It can contribute to gluconeogenesis.
- **B: Methionine** – Glucogenic, as it is converted into succinyl-CoA, which can enter the TCA cycle.
- **C: Alanine** – Glucogenic, converted into pyruvate, a key substrate for gluconeogenesis.
- **D: Glutamine** – Glucogenic, as it is converted into alpha-ketoglutarate, a TCA cycle intermediate.
- **E: Isoleucine** – Both glucogenic and ketogenic. Its breakdown products can contribute to gluconeogenesis.
- **F: Histidine** – Glucogenic, as it breaks down into alpha-ketoglutarate.
- **G: Threonine** – Glucogenic, converted into intermediates like glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.
- **H: Arginine** – Glucogenic, as it is converted into alpha-ketoglutarate via the urea cycle.
- **I: Leucine** – Purely ketogenic. It is broken down into acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate, which cannot be used for gluconeogenesis.
- **J: Valine** – Glucogenic, as it is converted into succinyl-CoA.

Leucine (I) is the only amino acid listed that cannot provide a substrate for gluconeogenesis, as it is purely ketogenic and cannot be converted into glucose. 

Answer: I
