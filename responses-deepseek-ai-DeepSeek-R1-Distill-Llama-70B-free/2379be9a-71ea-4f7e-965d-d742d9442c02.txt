Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find V_ab(t) given some expressions. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with Laplace transforms, the idea is to convert the given Laplace domain expression into the time domain. The problem gives me V_ab(s) in terms of V(s), so I probably need to find V(s) first, then manipulate it accordingly.

The given equation is V_ab(s) = [3V(s) + 3s + 27] / (s² +6s +8). Hmm. So I need to express V_ab(s) correctly.

Wait, wait. I think I remember that V(s) is the Laplace transform of v(t). The given v(t) is 10e^(-4t)u(t), where u(t) is the unit step function. So to find V(s), I can use the Laplace transform formula for an exponential multiplied by u(t).

The Laplace transform of e^(-at)u(t) is 1/(s + a). So for v(t) =10e^(-4t)u(t), V(s) should be 10/(s +4). Got that.

Okay, so plugging V(s) into the equation for V_ab(s):

V_ab(s) = [3*(10/(s+4)) +3s +27 ] / (s² +6s +8).

Let me compute the numerator first. 3*(10/(s+4)) is 30/(s+4). Then, adding 3s and 27 gives the entire numerator as (30/(s+4) +3s +27).

Hmm, combining these terms. I think I need a common denominator to combine them. Let me find a common denominator, which would be s+4. So I can rewrite each term:

3s becomes 3s*(s+4)/(s+4) = [3s² +12s]/(s+4)
27 becomes 27*(s+4)/(s+4) = [27s +108]/(s+4)
So the numerator becomes [30 + 3s² +12s +27s +108]/(s+4)
Wait, let me add those terms in the numerator:

30 + (3s² +12s +27s) +108 = 3s² + (12+27)s +30 +108
12+27 is 39, and 30+108 is 138. So numerator is [3s² +39s +138]/(s+4)

So V_ab(s) = [ (3s² +39s +138)/(s+4) ] / (s² +6s +8 )

Because the denominator is s² +6s +8, which factors into (s+2)(s+4), since 2*4=8 and 2+4=6.

So putting it all together:

V_ab(s) = (3s² +39s +138) / [ (s+4)(s+2)(s+4) ) ]

Wait, because denominator is (s+4)*(s+2) from s²+6s+8, and the numerator's denominator is (s+4). So overall, the denominator becomes (s+4)^2*(s+2). Hmm, wait. Let me re-express the denominator correctly.

Wait, the denominator of the big fraction is (s²+6s+8) = (s+2)(s+4), and the numerator's term has a denominator of (s+4). So when I divide, it's like:

Numerator: (3s² +39s +138) / (s+4)
Denominator: (s+2)(s+4)

So the overall fraction is (3s²+39s +138) / [ (s+4) * (s+2)(s+4) ) ] = (3s² +39s +138) / [ (s+4)^2 (s+2) ) ]

Hmm, perhaps I can factor the numerator. Let's see: 3s² +39s +138. Let me factor 3 out first: 3(s² +13s +46). Wait, 13*2=26, but 46 isn't a multiple of 13. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait a minute, perhaps instead of trying to combine all terms into a single fraction, I could have split V_ab(s) into partial fractions. Maybe that's the way to go.

Wait, let me re-express V_ab(s) as [3V(s) +3s +27 ] divided by (s²+6s+8). So let me compute 3V(s) +3s +27.

We have V(s) = 10/(s+4). So 3V(s) is 30/(s+4). So 3V(s) +3s +27 = 30/(s+4) +3s +27.

Let me write this as 3s +27 + 30/(s+4). Now, perhaps I can combine the polynomial terms with the fraction.

Expressed as a single fraction: [ (3s+27)(s+4) +30 ] / (s+4).

Expanding numerator:

(3s)(s) + 3s*(4) + 27*s +27*4 +30
= 3s² +12s +27s +108 +30
= 3s² + (12s +27s) + (108 +30)
=3s² +39s +138.

So the numerator is 3s² +39s +138, denominator is s+4. So V_ab(s) becomes [3s² +39s +138]/(s+4) divided by (s² +6s +8) which is (s+2)(s+4).

So V_ab(s) = [3s² +39s +138 ] / [ (s+4)(s+2)(s+4) ) ] = [3s² +39s +138] / [ (s+4)^2 (s+2) ) ]

Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Maybe factor numerator and denominator.

Wait, let's factor numerator 3s²+39s+138. Let me factor 3 out: 3(s² +13s +46). Hmm, checking discriminant of s² +13s +46: D=169 - 184 = -15, so no real roots. That complicates partial fractions.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me double-check.

Wait, wait. Let me go back to 3V(s) +3s +27.

V(s) is 10/(s+4). So 3V(s) is 30/(s+4).

Then, 3V(s) +3s +27 = 30/(s+4) + 3s +27.

To combine these into a single fraction, the denominator is (s+4), so we'll write 3s +27 as (3s+27)(s+4)/(s+4) plus 30/(s+4).

So the numerator becomes (3s+27)(s+4) +30.

Expanding (3s+27)(s+4) = 3s*s +3s*4 +27*s +27*4 = 3s² +12s +27s +108.

Adding 30: 3s² +39s +138. So yes, that's correct.

So V_ab(s) = (3s² +39s +138) / [ (s+4)(s^2+6s+8) ]

Wait, because denominator is (s+4)*(s+2)(s+4) ?

Wait, s² +6s +8 factors into (s+2)(s+4). So denominator is (s+4)*(s+2)(s+4) = (s+4)^2 (s+2).

So V_ab(s) = [3s² +39s +138 ] / [ (s+4)^2 (s+2) ) ]

Hmm. Now, perhaps I can perform partial fraction expansion on this.

Let me write V_ab(s) as [ A/(s+2) ) + (B/(s+4)) + (C/(s+4)^2) ) ]

Wait, because the denominator factors into (s+2)(s+4)^2, the partial fractions would have terms A/(s+2), B/(s+4), and C/(s+4)^2.

So:

[3s² +39s +138 ] / [ (s+2)(s+4)^2 ) ] = A/(s+2) + B/(s+4) + C/(s+4)^2.

Multiply both sides by (s+2)(s+4)^2 to get:

3s² +39s +138 = A (s+4)^2 + B (s+2)(s+4) + C (s+2).

Expanding each term on the right:

First term: A(s+4)^2 = A(s² +8s +16)
Second term: B(s+2)(s+4) = B(s² +6s +8)
Third term: C(s+2) = Cs +2C.

So combining everything:

Right side = A s² +8A s +16A + B s² +6B s +8B + C s + 2C.

Group like terms:

s² terms: (A + B) s²
s terms: (8A +6B + C) s
constants: 16A +8B +2C.

Set equal to left side: 3s² +39s +138.

So we have the equations:

A + B = 3 ...(1)
8A +6B + C = 39 ...(2)
16A +8B +2C = 138 ...(3)

Now, solve this system.

From equation (1): B = 3 - A.

Substitute B into equation (2):

8A +6*(3 - A) + C = 39
8A +18 -6A + C =39
(2A) + C = 21 --> equation (2a)

Substitute B into equation (3):

16A +8*(3 - A) +2C =138
16A +24 -8A +2C =138
8A +2C = 114 --> divide by 2: 4A + C =57 --> equation (3a)

Now, from equation (2a): C =21 -2A.

Substitute into equation (3a):

4A + (21 -2A) =57
2A +21 =57
2A=36 --> A=18.

Wait, 2A=57-21=36? Wait, 57-21=36, yes. So A=18.

Then from equation (1): B=3 -18 = -15.

From equation (2a): C=21 -2*(18)=21-36= -15.

So now, the partial fractions are:

V_ab(s) = 18/(s+2) -15/(s+4) -15/(s+4)^2.

Now, taking the inverse Laplace transform term by term.

The inverse Laplace of 18/(s+2) is 18 e^{-2t} u(t).

The inverse Laplace of -15/(s+4) is -15 e^{-4t} u(t).

The inverse Laplace of -15/(s+4)^2 is -15 * t e^{-4t} u(t), because L^{-1} {1/(s+a)^2} = t e^{-at} u(t).

So combining these:

V_ab(t) = 18 e^{-2t} -15 e^{-4t} -15 t e^{-4t}.

Wait, but wait, let me write it properly.

So V_ab(t) = [18 e^{-2t}] + [ -15 e^{-4t} ] + [ -15 t e^{-4t} ]

Alternatively, factor e^{-4t} terms:

V_ab(t) = 18 e^{-2t} -15 e^{-4t} (1 + t )

Wait, but looking at the options, let me see. Let me write all terms:

18 e^{-2t} -15 e^{-4t} -15 t e^{-4t}.

Wait, let me rearrange:

= -15 t e^{-4t} -15 e^{-4t} +18 e^{-2t}.

Looking at the options:

Option A: -15te^-4t -15e^-4t +18e^-2t
Option B: 15te^-4t -15e^-4t +18e^-2t
Option E: 15te^-4t +15e^-4t -18e^-2t
Option H: -15te^-4t +15e^-4t +18e^-2t

So our expression matches option A exactly.

Wait, but let me check the signs again.

In our calculation, V_ab(s) was broken into 18/(s+2), -15/(s+4), and -15/(s+4)^2. So inverse is 18 e^{-2t} -15 e^{-4t} -15 t e^{-4t}.

Which is the same as -15 t e^{-4t} -15 e^{-4t} +18 e^{-2t}.

Looking at option A: -15te^-4t -15e^-4t +18e^-2t. Yes, that's exactly what we have.

So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but let me cross-check with the options.

Option B has positive 15te^-4t. So no, we have negative.

So yes, the correct answer is option A.

To find \( V_{ab}(t) \), we start with the given relationship:

\[
V_{ab}(s) = \frac{3V(s) + 3s + 27}{s^2 + 6s + 8}.
\]

Here, \( V(s) \) is the Laplace transform of \( v(t) = 10e^{-4t}u(t) \), which is:

\[
V(s) = \frac{10}{s + 4}.
\]

Substituting \( V(s) \) into the expression for \( V_{ab}(s) \):

\[
V_{ab}(s) = \frac{3 \cdot \frac{10}{s + 4} + 3s + 27}{s^2 + 6s + 8}.
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
3 \cdot \frac{10}{s + 4} = \frac{30}{s + 4}, \quad \text{so the numerator becomes: }
\frac{30}{s + 4} + 3s + 27.
\]

To combine these terms, use a common denominator \( s + 4 \):

\[
\frac{30}{s + 4} + \frac{(3s + 27)(s + 4)}{s + 4}.
\]

Expanding \( (3s + 27)(s + 4) \):

\[
(3s + 27)(s + 4) = 3s^2 + 12s + 27s + 108 = 3s^2 + 39s + 138.
\]

Thus, the numerator becomes:

\[
\frac{30 + 3s^2 + 39s + 138}{s + 4} = \frac{3s^2 + 39s + 168}{s + 4}.
\]

Now, \( V_{ab}(s) \) is:

\[
V_{ab}(s) = \frac{\frac{3s^2 + 39s + 168}{s + 4}}{s^2 + 6s + 8}.
\]

The denominator \( s^2 + 6s + 8 \) factors as \( (s + 2)(s + 4) \), so:

\[
V_{ab}(s) = \frac{3s^2 + 39s + 168}{(s + 4)^2(s + 2)}.
\]

Next, perform partial fraction decomposition:

\[
\frac{3s^2 + 39s + 168}{(s + 4)^2(s + 2)} = \frac{A}{s + 2} + \frac{B}{s + 4} + \frac{C}{(s + 4)^2}.
\]

Multiply through by \( (s + 4)^2(s + 2) \):

\[
3s^2 + 39s + 168 = A(s + 4)^2 + B(s + 2)(s + 4) + C(s + 2).
\]

Expanding and equating coefficients:

1. \( A + B = 3 \),
2. \( 8A + 6B + C = 39 \),
3. \( 16A + 8B + 2C = 138 \).

Solving this system:

- From \( A + B = 3 \), we get \( B = 3 - A \).
- Substituting \( B = 3 - A \) into \( 8A + 6B + C = 39 \), we find \( C = 21 - 2A \).
- Substituting \( B = 3 - A \) and \( C = 21 - 2A \) into \( 16A + 8B + 2C = 138 \), we solve for \( A = 18 \), \( B = -15 \), and \( C = -15 \).

Thus:

\[
V_{ab}(s) = \frac{18}{s + 2} - \frac{15}{s + 4} - \frac{15}{(s + 4)^2}.
\]

Taking the inverse Laplace transform:

- \( \mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\{\frac{18}{s + 2}\right\} = 18e^{-2t} \),
- \( \mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\{-\frac{15}{s + 4}\right\} = -15e^{-4t} \),
- \( \mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\{-\frac{15}{(s + 4)^2}\right\} = -15te^{-4t} \).

Combining these:

\[
V_{ab}(t) = 18e^{-2t} - 15e^{-4t} - 15te^{-4t}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
V_{ab}(t) = -15te^{-4t} -
