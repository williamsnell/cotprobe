Question:

In the NoNicks operating system, the time required by a single file-read operation has four nonoverlapping components:
disk seek time-25 msec
disk latency time-8 msec
disk transfer time- 1 msec per 1,000 bytes
operating system overhead-1 msec per 1,000 bytes + 10 msec
In version 1 of the system, the file read retrieved blocks of 1,000 bytes. In version 2, the file read (along with the underlying layout on disk) was modified to retrieve blocks of 4,000 bytes. The ratio of-the time required to read a large file under version 2 to the time required to read the same large file under version 1 is approximately

Okay, so I have this question about the NoNicks operating system and file read times for two different versions. Hmm, I need to figure out the time ratio between version 2 and version 1 when reading a large file. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll list out the given components of the file-read time. There are four parts:

1. Disk seek time: 25 ms.
2. Disk latency time: 8 ms.
3. Disk transfer time: 1 ms per 1,000 bytes.
4. Operating system overhead: 1 ms per 1,000 bytes plus 10 ms.

Wait, so the transfer time and OS overhead both depend on the number of bytes, while seek and latency are fixed per operation.

Now, each version reads a different block size. Version 1 reads 1,000 bytes per block, and version 2 reads 4,000 bytes per block. The question is about reading a large file, so I guess the number of blocks read would be large enough that the per-block times add up significantly.

Let me think about how to model the total time for each version.

For a single read operation, the time is the sum of all four components. But since we're reading a large file, I'm assuming that each version will perform multiple read operations. Wait, no—when a file is read, the system reads it in blocks. So if the file is large, the number of read operations depends on the block size. For example, a file that's 40,000 bytes would require 40 read operations in version 1 (each 1,000 bytes) but 10 in version 2 (each 4,000 bytes).

Wait, but the question is about the time per read. Or is it about the total time to read the entire file? I think it's the total time for the same large file in each version. So I'll need to compare the total time for a large file in version 1 versus version 2.

Let me denote the file size as N bytes. Since it's large, N is much larger than the block sizes. So for version 1, the number of blocks is N / 1000, and for version 2, it's N / 4000. But wait, since each read operation (each block) incurs all four time components, the total time will be the number of blocks multiplied by each component's time per block.

Wait, no. Wait, each read operation is a single block. So each read has its own seek, latency, transfer time, and OS overhead. So the total time is the sum over all reads, each contributing (seek + latency + transfer + OS).

But wait, is the seek time per read operation? Or is it per file read? Hmm, the question says each read operation has four components. So each time the system reads a block, it incurs all four times.

So for a large file, the time is the number of blocks multiplied by the sum of each component per block.

So let me calculate the time per block for each version, then multiply by the number of blocks.

But wait, for a large file, maybe the seek time isn't per block. Because if the blocks are contiguous, then perhaps after the first seek, the next blocks are nearby, so seek time is negligible. But the problem statement doesn't specify anything about that, so I have to go with the given data, which says that each read has a disk seek time of 25 ms. So I think each read operation incurs 25 ms of seek time, regardless of how many blocks are read.

So the time per read (block) is:

seek + latency + transfer + OS.

So for each read operation:

T1_version = 25 ms (seek) + 8 ms (latency) + (transfer time per 1000 bytes) * n_bytes + (OS overhead per 1000 bytes * n_bytes + 10 ms).

Wait, no. Wait, the transfer time is 1 ms per 1000 bytes. So for a block of size B bytes, the transfer time is (B / 1000) * 1 ms.

Similarly, the OS overhead is (B / 1000)*1 ms + 10 ms.

Wait, but the way it's written: "operating system overhead-1 msec per 1,000 bytes + 10 msec". So I think it's 1ms per 1000 bytes plus 10 ms. So for B bytes, OS is (B/1000)*1 + 10 ms.

So for a single read of B bytes, the time is:

seek (25) + latency (8) + (B/1000) *1 (transfer) + ( (B/1000)*1 + 10 ) (OS overhead).

So combining terms, the total per read time is 25 +8 + [ (B/1000) + (B/1000) +10 ].

Wait, because transfer is 1 ms per 1000, and OS is (1 ms per 1000) +10. So transfer is (B/1000)*1, and OS is (B/1000)*1 +10.

So per read, total time is:

25 + 8 + (B/1000) + (B/1000 +10) = 25 +8 + 2*(B/1000) +10.

Wait, 25 +8 is 33, plus 2*(B/1000) plus 10: so 43 + 2*(B/1000) ms per read.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me recompute:

Each read operation has:

- 25 ms (seek)
- 8 ms (latency)
- transfer time: (B/1000) *1 ms
- OS: (B/1000)*1 ms +10 ms

So adding them up:

25 +8 = 33

33 + (B/1000) [transfer] + (B/1000 +10) [OS]

So that's 33 + (B/1000) + B/1000 +10 = 43 + 2*(B/1000)

So yes, per read, time is 43 + 2*(B/1000) ms.

Now, for version 1, B is 1000 bytes. So per read:

43 + 2*(1000/1000) = 43 + 2 =45 ms per read.

In version 1, the number of reads for a file of size N bytes is N / 1000.

So total time for version 1: T1 = (N/1000) * 45 ms.

Similarly, for version 2, B is 4000 bytes. So per read:

43 + 2*(4000/1000) = 43 + 8 =51 ms per read.

Number of reads is N /4000.

So total time for version 2: T2 = (N/4000) *51 ms.

We need to find the ratio T2 : T1.

T2 = (N/4000)*51
T1 = (N/1000)*45

Let me compute T2 / T1.

(N/4000 *51) / (N/1000 *45 ) = (51/4000) / (45/1000) ) = (51 * 1000) / (45 *4000 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

51*1000 =51,000
45*4000=180,000

So 51,000 / 180,000 = 51/180 = 17/60 ≈0.2833.

So T2 is approximately 0.283 times T1, which is the same as T2:T1 =1:3.529, approximately 1:3.5.

Wait, but the options don't have a 1:3.5 ratio as the correct answer. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A:1:4 → 0.25

B:1:2 →0.5

C:1:1 →1

D:1:1.5 →≈0.666

E:1:3.5 →≈0.285

So option E is 1:3.5, which matches our calculation. So the ratio is approximately 1:3.5, which would be option E.

Wait, wait, but the question says the ratio of version 2 to version 1. So T2 / T1 is 17/60 ≈0.283, so the ratio is 0.283, which is approximately 1:3.5. So yes, option E is 1:3.5.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 1:3.5. So that's the correct answer.

But let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating T2 and T1.

Let me recalculate.

For version 1:

Each read is 1000 bytes.

Time per read = 25 +8 + (1000/1000)*1 + (1000/1000)*1 +10.

Wait, wait, the OS overhead is 1 ms per 1000 bytes plus 10 ms. So for 1000 bytes, it's 1 +10 =11 ms.

Transfer time is 1 ms (1000/1000 *1).

So per read: 25 +8 +1 +11 = 45 ms. That's correct.

Number of reads: N /1000.

Total T1: (N/1000)*45 ms.

Version 2:

Each read is 4000 bytes.

Time per read: 25 +8 + (4000/1000)*1 + [ (4000/1000)*1 +10 ]

So 25+8 =33.

4000/1000=4, so transfer is 4 ms.

OS: 4*1 +10 =14 ms.

So total per read: 33 +4 +14 =51 ms. Correct.

Number of reads: N /4000.

Total T2: (N/4000)*51.

So T2 = (51/4000) *N.

T1= (45/1000)*N.

Ratio T2/T1 = (51/(4000)) / (45/(1000)) ) = (51 *1000) / (45*4000) )=51000/(180000)= 0.2833.

So 0.2833 is 17/60, which is approximately 0.2833.

So the ratio T2 : T1 is 0.2833, which is about 1:3.529, which is approximately 1:3.5.

Looking at the options, option E is 1:3.5.

So the correct answer should be E.

To determine the ratio of the time required to read a large file under version 2 of the NoNicks operating system to the time required under version 1, we analyze the total time for each version based on the given components of the file-read operation:

### Components of File-Read Time:
1. **Disk Seek Time**: 25 ms (fixed per read operation).
2. **Disk Latency Time**: 8 ms (fixed per read operation).
3. **Disk Transfer Time**: 1 ms per 1,000 bytes.
4. **Operating System Overhead**: 1 ms per 1,000 bytes + 10 ms.

### Version 1 (Block Size = 1,000 Bytes):
- **Time per read operation**:  
  \[
  25 \, \text{ms} + 8 \, \text{ms} + \left(\frac{1000}{1000} \cdot 1 \, \text{ms}\right) + \left(\frac{1000}{1000} \cdot 1 \, \text{ms} + 10 \, \text{ms}\right) = 45 \, \text{ms}.
  \]
- **Number of read operations for a file of size \(N\) bytes**: \(\frac{N}{1000}\).
- **Total time for version 1**:  
  \[
  T_1 = \left(\frac{N}{1000}\right) \cdot 45 \, \text{ms}.
  \]

### Version 2 (Block Size = 4,000 Bytes):
- **Time per read operation**:  
  \[
  25 \, \text{ms} + 8 \, \text{ms} + \left(\frac{4000}{1000} \cdot 1 \, \text{ms}\right) + \left(\frac{4000}{1000} \cdot 1 \, \text{ms} + 10 \, \text{ms}\right) = 51 \, \text{ms}.
  \]
- **Number of read operations for a file of size \(N\) bytes**: \(\frac{N}{4000}\).
- **Total time for version 2**:  
  \[
  T_2 = \left(\frac{N}{4000}\right) \cdot 51 \, \text{ms}.
  \]

### Ratio of Total Times:
The ratio of the time required under version 2 to version 1 is:
\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \frac{\left(\frac{N}{4000} \cdot 51\right)}{\left(\frac{N}{1000} \cdot 45\right)} = \frac{51 \cdot 1000}{45 \cdot 4000} = \frac{51000}{180000} = \frac{17}{60} \approx 0.2833.
\]
This corresponds to a ratio of approximately \(1:3.5\).

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **E: 1:3.5**.
