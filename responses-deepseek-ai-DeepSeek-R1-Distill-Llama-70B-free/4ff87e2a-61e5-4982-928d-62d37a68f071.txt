Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about three contrasting explanations of anxiety. I'm a bit new to psychology, so I need to think carefully about each option.

The question is asking for three different theories or models that explain anxiety in different ways. I remember that anxiety can be explained through various psychological perspectives, so I should probably go through each option and see which ones fit.

Let's look at the options one by one.

Option A: Psychoanalytic theory, social learning theory, and control theory. Hmm, psychoanalytic I know is Freudian, about unconscious conflicts. Social learning is about observing others, like Bandura's work. Control theory... I'm not too sure, but I think it relates to how people's behavior is controlled by their perceptions of control, maybe like self-efficacy? So these are three different approaches: psychodynamic, behavioral, and maybe cognitive-behavioral or something else. But I'm not certain if all three are commonly used to explain anxiety.

Option B: Cognitive dissonance theory, behavioral perspective, and diathesis-stress model. Cognitive dissonance is more about conflicting thoughts causing discomfort, not sure if it's a primary explanation for anxiety. Behavioral perspective is like classical conditioning, which certainly explains phobias. Diathesis-stress is a model where a person has a vulnerability (diathesis) and stress triggers the disorder. So that's three different angles but I'm not sure if they're all considered main explanations.

Option C: Psychoanalytic, stimulus-response theory, and Maslow's hierarchy. Stimulus-response is behavioral again, like conditioning. Maslow's hierarchy is more about motivation and needs, not directly about anxiety. So maybe not all three are focused on anxiety.

Option D: Fight or flight, psychoanalytic, and control theory. Fight or flight is a biological response, which is part of the body's reaction to danger. Psychoanalytic again is Freudian. Control theory I'm still unsure about, but maybe it's about feeling in control as a factor in anxiety. So that's biological, psychodynamic, and maybe cognitive. But not sure if control theory is a major explanation for anxiety.

Option E: Attachment theory, psychodynamic, and behavioral genetics. Attachment theory is about early relationships and how they affect later behaviors. Psychodynamic is Freudian. Behavioral genetics looks at genetic factors. So these are three different approaches but not sure if all directly explain anxiety as their main focus.

Option F: Social learning theory, existential analysis, and biomedical model. Social learning is about learning from others. Existential is more about meaning and existence, which could tie into anxiety as something inherent to human existence. Biomedical is the biological model, looking for physical causes. So that's three distinct approaches, each from different perspectives.

Option G: Psychoanalytic theory of neurotic anxiety, stimulus-response explanation, and concepts of control and helplessness. Wait, the first is Freud's theory where anxiety is a result of unconscious conflicts. Stimulus-response would be behavioral explanations, like conditioning. Control and helplessness sounds like learned helplessness theory, which is more cognitive-behavioral. So that's three different theories: psychodynamic, behavioral, and cognitive-behavioral. That sounds like a good trio of contrasting explanations.

Option H: Cognitive-behavioral, humanistic, and evolutionary psychology. CBT is about thoughts and behaviors. Humanistic is about self-actualization and personal growth. Evolutionary looks at why anxiety might have evolved as an adaptive response. So these are three distinct approaches as well.

Option I: Evolutionary psychology, biopsychosocial model, and fight or flight. Evolutionary would explain anxiety as an adaptive mechanism. Biopsychosocial looks at the combination of biological, psychological, and social factors. Fight or flight is the body's immediate response. These are all valid, but perhaps fight or flight is more a specific biological response rather than a comprehensive theory.

Option J: Biological perspective, cognitive theory, and existential analysis. Biological would look at brain chemistry and genetics. Cognitive theory is about thought processes. Existential is about human existence and meaning. So that's three different angles.

Now, the question is about three contrasting explanations. So each should be from a different major school of thought in psychology.

Let me think about the main theories of anxiety. There's the psychoanalytic view (Freud), which attributes anxiety to unconscious conflicts or repressed thoughts. Then there's the behavioral view, which explains anxiety through classical conditioning, like phobias. The cognitive view would look at thought patterns and cognitive distortions leading to anxiety. There's also the biological perspective, which looks at genetics and neurotransmitters. Then there's the humanistic perspective, maybe less about anxiety, but more about personal growth. The evolutionary perspective might explain anxiety as an adaptive response.

So the question is asking for three of these. Let's look at the options again.

Option G says psychoanalytic theory of neurotic anxiety (so that's the Freudian), stimulus-response explanation (which is behavioral), and concepts of control and helplessness (which is cognitive-behavioral, like from Seligman's learned helplessness). So that's three different theories: psychodynamic, behavioral, and cognitive-behavioral. That seems to fit.

Option H has cognitive-behavioral, humanistic, and evolutionary. So that's three different approaches, but I'm not sure if humanistic is a primary theory for explaining anxiety.

Option J includes biological, cognitive, and existential. That's also three.

Wait, the question says "three contrasting explanations." So each of the three should be from different schools.

Looking back, the question is asking for three explanations, so each from a different perspective.

Option G includes three distinct perspectives: psychoanalytic (psychodynamic), behavioral (stimulus-response), and cognitive (control/helplessness). So that's three.

Option B has cognitive dissonance, which is a specific concept within cognitive theories, but maybe not the main explanation for anxiety. The diathesis-stress model is more about the cause of disorders in general, combining predisposition and stress.

Option G seems to cover three major perspectives on anxiety. So the correct answer is G.

To address the question of three contrasting explanations of anxiety, it is important to identify theories from distinct psychological perspectives that provide different insights into the phenomenon. Here's an analysis of the options:

- **Option A**: Includes psychoanalytic theory, social learning theory, and control theory. While these represent different approaches, control theory is not a primary explanation for anxiety.
- **Option B**: Features cognitive dissonance theory, behavioral perspective, and diathesis-stress model. Cognitive dissonance is more about conflicting thoughts than anxiety, and while the diathesis-stress model is relevant, it is not exclusively focused on anxiety.
- **Option C**: Includes psychoanalytic theory, stimulus-response theory, and Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Maslow's hierarchy is more about motivation and needs, not directly explaining anxiety.
- **Option D**: Lists fight or flight, psychoanalytic theory, and control theory. Fight or flight is a biological response, but control theory is not a major explanation for anxiety.
- **Option E**: Includes attachment theory, psychodynamic explanation, and behavioral genetics. While these are distinct, they are not all primarily focused on anxiety.
- **Option F**: Features social learning theory, existential analysis, and the biomedical model. These are distinct perspectives, but existential analysis is not a primary explanation for anxiety.
- **Option G**: Includes psychoanalytic theory of neurotic anxiety, stimulus-response explanation, and concepts of control and helplessness. This option covers three well-defined perspectives: psychodynamic (Freudian), behavioral (stimulus-response), and cognitive-behavioral (control/helplessness). These are contrasting and directly relevant to explaining anxiety.
- **Option H**: Includes cognitive-behavioral approach, humanistic perspective, and evolutionary psychology. While these are distinct, the humanistic perspective is less focused on anxiety.
- **Option I**: Features evolutionary psychology, biopsychosocial model, and fight or flight response. Fight or flight is more a specific biological response than a comprehensive theory.
- **Option J**: Includes biological perspective, cognitive theory, and existential analysis. These are distinct, but existential analysis is not a primary explanation for anxiety.

**Option G** stands out as it provides three contrasting explanations directly relevant to anxiety: psychoanalytic theory (psychodynamic), stimulus-response explanation (behavioral), and concepts of control and helplessness (cognitive-behavioral). These perspectives are well-established and provide a comprehensive understanding of anxiety from different angles.
