Okay, so I have this problem about fluid flow and calculating the rate of flow outward through a cylinder. Hmm, I remember that the rate of flow is related to the flux of the velocity field through a surface, right? Oh wait, but wait, since it's a fluid with density, maybe I need to consider mass flow rate instead of just volume flow rate.

The fluid's density is given as 870 kg/m³. The velocity vector v is given in components: v = z i + y² j + x² k. So each component depends on different variables. The cylinder is defined by x² + y² =4, which is a cylinder of radius 2 extending along the z-axis, from z=0 to z=1.

I think I need to compute the mass flow rate. Oh right, mass flow rate is the integral of density multiplied by the velocity flux through the surface. So the formula should be the density times the flux integral of the velocity field over the surface.

Flux integral is the double integral over the surface of v · n dS, where n is the unit normal vector. Since the cylinder is a closed surface, or wait, no, the cylinder here is a side surface, not including the ends. Wait, the cylinder is x²+y²=4, and z ranges from 0 to1. So the surface is just the curved side, not the top and bottom disks.

So for this cylindrical surface, what's the normal vector? Well, in cylindrical coordinates, the outward normal would point radially outward in the x-y plane. So the normal vector would have components in the i and j directions, but I think in cylindrical terms, for a cylinder x²+y²=r², the outward normal vector n is (x i + y j)/r, where r is the radius, which is 2 here.

Wait, let me think. The cylinder equation is x² + y² =4, so the gradient is (2x, 2y, 0), which points in the radial direction. So the normal vector is (x, y, 0) divided by its magnitude. The magnitude of (x,y,0) is sqrt(x²+y²)=2, since on the cylinder x²+y²=4. So the unit normal n is (x/2) i + (y/2) j + 0 k.

So when taking the dot product of v and n, it's (v · n) = [z i + y² j + x² k] · [x/(2) i + y/(2) j + 0 k].

Calculating that, it's z*(x/2) + y²*(y/2) + x²*0. So that's (zx)/2 + (y³)/2.

So the flux integral becomes the surface integral over the cylinder of (zx/2 + y³/2) dS.

But wait, integrating over a cylinder. Maybe it's easier to parametrize the surface. Let's use cylindrical coordinates. Let’s set x = 2 cosθ, y = 2 sinθ, and z goes from 0 to1. The parameterization would have θ from 0 to 2π, and z from 0 to 1.

In cylindrical coordinates, the surface element dS is the product of the circumference element (rdθ) and the height dz, but wait, no, for a cylinder, the surface area element is r dθ dz, where r is the radius, which is 2 here.

So dS = (2) dθ dz.

Wait, yes. Because when you have a parametrization in terms of θ and z, the differential surface element dS is the product of the differentials multiplied by the scaling factors. For a cylinder, moving θ around the circle and z along the height, the scaling factors are r (for θ) and 1 (for z). So dS = r dθ dz = 2 dθ dz.

So the integral becomes ∫∫ [ (zx)/2 + (y³)/2 ] * dS.

But substituting x=2 cosθ, y=2 sinθ, and z is z. So let's compute each term.

First, compute (zx)/2:

z * x /2 = z*(2 cosθ)/2 = z cosθ.

Second term, (y³)/2 = ( (2 sinθ)³ ) / 2 = (8 sin³θ)/2 = 4 sin³θ.

So the integrand becomes z cosθ + 4 sin³θ.

So the integral is ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (z=0 to 1) [z cosθ + 4 sin³θ ] * (2 dz dθ).

Wait, because dS is 2 dθ dz, so the integral is [ integrand ] * 2 dz dθ.

Wait, no, the flux integral is ∫∫ [v · n] dS = ∫∫ [ (zx/2 + y^3/2) ] * (2 dθ dz) ), because dS = 2 dθ dz. So the 2 comes from the surface element.

Wait no, maybe I should re-express the integral correctly.

Wait, the flux integral is the double integral over the surface S of (v · n) dS.

We have (v · n) = (zx)/2 + (y^3)/2.

And dS is the area element on the cylinder, which is 2 dθ dz.

So the integral becomes ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (z=0 to 1) [ (zx)/2 + (y^3)/2 ] * 2 dz dθ.

But substituting x=2 cosθ, y=2 sinθ, we get:

For (zx)/2: (z * 2 cosθ)/2 = z cosθ.

For (y^3)/2: (2 sinθ)^3 /2 = (8 sin^3θ)/2 = 4 sin^3θ.

So the integrand becomes (z cosθ + 4 sin^3θ) multiplied by 2 (from dS), so:

Integral = ∫θ=0 to 2π [ ∫z=0 to1 (z cosθ +4 sin³θ) * 2 dz ] dθ.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should factor out the 2:

= 2 ∫θ=0 to 2π [ ∫z=0 to1 (z cosθ +4 sin³θ) dz ] dθ.

Now, let's compute the inner integral first, integrating with respect to z from 0 to1.

The inner integral is ∫z=0 to1 [ z cosθ +4 sin³θ ] dz.

Split into two terms:

∫z cosθ dz from 0 to1: cosθ * ∫z dz = cosθ * [z²/2] from 0 to 1 = cosθ * (1/2 -0) )= cosθ/2.

And ∫4 sin³θ dz from 0 to1: 4 sin³θ * ∫dz from 0 to1 = 4 sin³θ * (1 -0) )= 4 sin³θ.

So the inner integral becomes (cosθ/2) + 4 sin³θ.

Now, the overall integral is 2 ∫θ=0 to 2π [ (cosθ/2) +4 sin³θ ] dθ.

Let me split this into two terms:

Term 1: 2 ∫ (cosθ/2) dθ from 0 to 2π.

Term 2: 2 ∫4 sin³θ dθ from 0 to 2π.

Compute term 1:

2 * (1/2) ∫ cosθ dθ from 0 to 2π.

The (1/2) comes from cosθ/2. So 2*(1/2) =1.

Integral of cosθ over 0 to 2π is sinθ evaluated from 0 to 2π, which is 0. So term 1 is zero.

Compute term 2:

2 *4 ∫ sin³θ dθ from 0 to 2π =8 ∫ sin³θ dθ from 0 to2π.

Hmm, the integral of sin^3θ over 0 to 2π. Let's think about it.

Wait, sin^3θ is an odd function if you shift it, but over a full period, perhaps the integral is zero? Or wait, sin^3θ is symmetric in a way that its integral over 0 to 2π is zero.

Wait no, more accurately, let me compute ∫ sin³θ dθ from 0 to 2π.

We can use substitution or recall that ∫ sin^n θ dθ over 0 to 2π is zero for odd n. Because sin^3θ is an odd function when considering the interval from -π to π, but from 0 to 2π, it's periodic with period 2π. Wait, actually, over a full period, the integral of sin^3θ is zero. Because sinθ is symmetric around π, and the positive and negative areas cancel.

Wait, let's compute ∫ sin³θ dθ from 0 to 2π.

We can write sin^3θ as sinθ (1 - cos²θ). So the integral becomes ∫ sinθ (1 - cos²θ) dθ.

Let u = cosθ, then du = -sinθ dθ.

So the integral becomes ∫ (1 - u²) (-du) evaluated from u=1 to u=1 (since when θ=0, u=1; when θ=2π, u=1 again). Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, when θ=0, u=1; θ=π, u=-1; θ=2π, u=1.

Wait, no, if I'm integrating from 0 to 2π, then when θ goes from 0 to 2π, u goes from 1, down to -1, and back to 1. So we can split the integral into two parts: 0 to π, and π to 2π.

But perhaps an easier approach is to compute it over 0 to 2π, using substitution.

Alternatively, note that sin^3θ is an odd function around θ=π. So the integral from 0 to 2π is zero. Or, more accurately, the function has a period of 2π, and the integral over any full period is zero. Wait, but wait, that's not quite right. For example, the average value of sinθ over 0 to 2π is zero, but sin^3θ is an odd function in some sense.

Alternatively, perhaps compute the integral:

∫₀^{2π} sin³θ dθ = 0.

Because for every θ in [0, π], there's a corresponding θ' = θ + π in [π, 2π], and sin(θ') = -sinθ. So sin^3(theta') = (-sinθ)^3 = -sin^3 theta. So each pair cancels out, leading to zero.

So the integral of sin^3θ from 0 to 2π is zero.

Therefore, term 2 becomes 8 * 0 = 0.

So the overall flux integral is term1 + term2 =0 +0=0.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, but wait, in the flux calculation, I think I might have made a mistake because I didn't consider the contributions correctly. Alternatively, maybe the flux is zero, implying no net flow through the cylinder.

Wait, but the question is about the rate of flow outward. So if the flux is zero, then the mass flow rate is zero?

Wait, but let's double-check the setup. The velocity field is v = z i + y² j + x² k.

Wait, when I computed v · n, I got (zx/2 + y³/2). Then, after substitution, it became z cosθ +4 sin^3θ. Then, multiplied by 2 (from dS=2 dθ dz), and integrated over θ and z.

Wait, the inner integral over z gave (cosθ/2) +4 sin^3θ, and then when multiplied by 2, the outer integral becomes 2 times the integral of (cosθ/2 +4 sin³θ) dθ.

Wait no, no, earlier steps: No, I think I messed up a step. Let me go back.

Wait, the flux integral is ∫∫ (v · n) dS.

v · n is (zx/2 + y³/2).

dS is the surface element, which for a cylinder is r dθ dz, so 2 dθ dz.

So the integral becomes ∫θ=0 to 2π ∫z=0 to1 [ (zx/2 + y^3/2) ] * 2 dz dθ.

So the 2 from dS multiplies the (zx/2 + y³/2), making it (zx + y³).

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express this.

The integrand is (v · n) * dS = (zx/2 + y³/2) * (2 dθ dz) = (zx + y³) dθ dz.

Ah, yes, because (zx/2 + y^3/2) multiplied by 2 is (zx + y^3).

So the integral simplifies to ∫θ=0 to2π ∫z=0 to1 (zx + y^3) dz dθ.

Wait, no, wait, the substitution is x=2 cosθ, y=2 sinθ.

So substituting x and y, we get:

zx = z * 2 cosθ.

y³ = (2 sinθ)^3 =8 sin^3θ.

So the integrand becomes (2 z cosθ +8 sin^3θ) dz dθ.

So the integral becomes:

∫θ=0 to2π [ ∫z=0 to1 (2 z cosθ +8 sin³θ) dz ] dθ.

Now, compute the inner integral with respect to z.

Inner integral ∫z=0 to1 (2 z cosθ +8 sin³θ) dz.

Break into two terms:

∫ 2 z cosθ dz = 2 cosθ ∫ z dz from 0 to1.

Integral of z is z²/2, from 0 to1: 1/2.

So term1: 2 cosθ * 1/2 = cosθ.

Term2: ∫8 sin³θ dz from 0 to1. Since sin³θ is treated as a constant with respect to z, this becomes 8 sin³θ * (1-0) =8 sin³θ.

So inner integral is cosθ +8 sin³θ.

Now, the overall integral is ∫θ=0 to2π (cosθ +8 sin³θ) dθ.

Split into two integrals:

Integral1: ∫ cosθ dθ from 0 to2π.

Integral2: 8 ∫ sin³θ dθ from 0 to2π.

As before, Integral1 is [sinθ] from 0 to2π, which is 0.

Integral2: 8 times the integral of sin^3θ over 0 to2π, which we determined earlier is zero.

So the total flux is 0 + 0 =0.

Wait, so the flux of the velocity field through the cylinder is zero. Then, the mass flow rate is density (870 kg/m³) multiplied by flux (0), giving zero.

So the rate of flow outward is zero, which is option E.
</think>

To determine the rate of flow outward through the cylinder \( x^2 + y^2 = 4 \), \( 0 \leq z \leq 1 \), we calculate the mass flow rate. The mass flow rate is given by the density of the fluid (\( 870 \, \mathrm{kg/m^3} \)) multiplied by the flux of the velocity field through the surface. The velocity field is \( \mathbf{v} = z \mathbf{i} + y^2 \mathbf{j} + x^2 \mathbf{k} \), and the cylinder is a curved surface with outward normal vector \( \mathbf{n} = \frac{x \mathbf{i} + y \mathbf{j}}{2} \).

### Step 1: Compute \( \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{n} \)
The dot product \( \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{n} \) is:
\[
\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{n} = \frac{z x}{2} + \frac{y^3}{2}.
\]

### Step 2: Parametrize the surface
Using cylindrical coordinates, \( x = 2 \cos\theta \), \( y = 2 \sin\theta \), and \( z \) ranges from \( 0 \) to \( 1 \). The surface element is \( dS = 2 \, d\theta \, dz \), where \( r = 2 \) is the radius of the cylinder.

### Step 3: Substitute into the flux integral
Substituting \( x = 2 \cos\theta \), \( y = 2 \sin\theta \), and \( dS = 2 \, d\theta \, dz \), the flux integral becomes:
\[
\iint_S (\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{n}) \, dS = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^1 \left( \frac{z (2 \cos\theta)}{2} + \frac{(2 \sin\theta)^3}{2} \right) (2 \, dz \, d\theta).
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{n} = z \cos\theta + 4 \sin^3\theta,
\]
and the integral becomes:
\[
\int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^1 \left( z \cos\theta + 4 \sin^3\theta \right) 2 \, dz \, d\theta.
\]

### Step 4: Evaluate the integral
First, integrate with respect to \( z \):
\[
\int_0^1 \left( z \cos\theta + 4 \sin^3\theta \right) 2 \, dz = 2 \left[ \int_0^1 z \cos\theta \, dz + \int_0^1 4 \sin^3\theta \, dz \right].
\]
- For \( \int_0^1 z \cos\theta \, dz \), since \( \cos\theta \) is constant with respect to \( z \):
\[
