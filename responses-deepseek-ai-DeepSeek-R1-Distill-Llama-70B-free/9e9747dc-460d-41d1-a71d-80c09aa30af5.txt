Okay, so I have this question about portfolio standard deviation. Hmm, let's see. I remember from my studies that when you have two assets, their portfolio's standard deviation isn't just the average of their individual standard deviations. It depends on their correlation as well. Oh right, the formula must involve the correlation coefficient.

Wait, the formula for the portfolio variance when you have two assets with equal weights. Since it's equally weighted, each has a weight of 50%, so 0.5 each. The formula is something like variance of portfolio = w1²σ1² + w2²σ2² + 2w1w2σ1σ2ρ. Yeah, that's right. Then the standard deviation is the square root of that.

So the given data: Stock A has a standard deviation of 6%, which is 0.06 in decimal. Stock B is 18%, so 0.18. The correlation between them is 0.2.

Let me plug the numbers in. Weights are both 0.5. So the portfolio variance would be (0.5)^2*(0.06)^2 + (0.5)^2*(0.18)^2 + 2*(0.5)*(0.5)*(0.06)*(0.18)*(0.2).

Calculating each part step by step:

First term: (0.25)*(0.0036) = 0.0009
Second term: (0.25)*(0.0324) = 0.0081
Third term: 2*(0.25)*(0.06*0.18*0.2)
Wait, 0.06 * 0.18 is 0.0108, multiplied by 0.2 gives 0.00216. Then 2 * 0.25 is 0.5, so 0.5 * 0.00216 = 0.00108.

Adding all three terms together: 0.0009 + 0.0081 = 0.009, plus 0.00108 gives 0.01008. So the portfolio variance is 0.01008. To get standard deviation, take the square root. Let's see, sqrt(0.01008) is approximately... let me calculate that. 

Hmm, sqrt(0.01) is 0.1, and 0.01008 is a bit more. Let me compute it precisely. 0.01008 is 1.008% as a decimal. Wait no, 0.01008 is 1.008% in terms of variance? Wait no, wait. Variance is in squared terms, but when converting back, the standard deviation is sqrt(variance). So 0.01008 is the variance, so sqrt(0.01008) is approximately 0.1004, which is 10.04%. Looking at the options, option F is 10%, which is the closest. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Calculating each term again:

First term: 0.5² * 0.06² = 0.25 * 0.0036 = 0.0009
Second term: 0.5² * 0.18² = 0.25 * 0.0324 = 0.0081
Third term: 2 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.06 * 0.18 * 0.2
So that's 0.5 * 0.06 * 0.18 * 0.2 * 2 * 0.5? Wait, no, let me clarify. The third term is 2 * (weight of A) * (weight of B) * σ_A * σ_B * ρ. So that's 2*(0.5)*(0.5)*(0.06)*(0.18)*(0.2). Let's compute that:

2 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.5. 0.5 * 0.06 = 0.03. 0.03 * 0.18 = 0.0054. 0.0054 * 0.2 = 0.00108. So yes, that's correct.

Adding all together: 0.0009 + 0.0081 = 0.009; 0.009 + 0.00108 = 0.01008.

Square root of 0.01008: Let me compute it more accurately. Let's think, 0.1 squared is 0.01. 0.1004^2 is approximately (0.1 + 0.0004)^2 = 0.01 + 2*0.1*0.0004 + (0.0004)^2 = 0.01 + 0.00008 + 0.00000016 = 0.01008016. Which is very close to 0.01008. So sqrt is approximately 0.1004, which is 10.04%, so 10% when rounded to the nearest whole number.

Looking back at the options, option F is 10%. So that's the correct answer.

To calculate the standard deviation of an equally weighted portfolio consisting of Stocks A and B, we use the formula for portfolio variance:

\[
\sigma_p^2 = w_1^2 \sigma_1^2 + w_2^2 \sigma_2^2 + 2 w_1 w_2 \sigma_1 \sigma_2 \rho
\]

Here:
- \( w_1 = w_2 = 0.5 \) (equal weights),
- \( \sigma_1 = 6\% = 0.06 \),
- \( \sigma_2 = 18\% = 0.18 \),
- \( \rho = 0.2 \) (correlation coefficient).

### Step 1: Calculate each term in the formula
1. \( w_1^2 \sigma_1^2 = (0.5)^2 (0.06)^2 = 0.25 \cdot 0.0036 = 0.0009 \)
2. \( w_2^2 \sigma_2^2 = (0.5)^2 (0.18)^2 = 0.25 \cdot 0.0324 = 0.0081 \)
3. \( 2 w_1 w_2 \sigma_1 \sigma_2 \rho = 2 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.06 \cdot 0.18 \cdot 0.2 = 0.5 \cdot 0.00216 = 0.00108 \)

### Step 2: Add the terms to find portfolio variance
\[
\sigma_p^2 = 0.0009 + 0.0081 + 0.00108 = 0.01008
\]

### Step 3: Calculate portfolio standard deviation
The standard deviation is the square root of the variance:
\[
\sigma_p = \sqrt{0.01008} \approx 0.1004 \, \text{or} \, 10.04\%
\]

### Final Answer
The closest option to 10.04% is **10%**, which corresponds to **option F**.
