Question:

A 22-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a 5-day history of sore throat and fever. During the past 3 days, she also has noticed a change in her voice and has had increased pain with swallowing. She has been taking acetaminophen since her symptoms began. Medical history is unremarkable and she takes no routine medications. Vital signs are temperature 40.0°C (104.0°F), pulse 130/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 102/66 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 97%. Examination of the oropharynx shows erythema, edema, and anterior displacement of the right side of the soft palate. The uvula is deviated to the left. There is a white exudate on the right tonsil. Trismus is noted. Palpation of the neck discloses enlarged, tender, mobile anterior cervical lymph nodes. In addition to antibiotic therapy, which of the following is the most appropriate management?

Options:

A: Oral nystatin therapy
B: Tranquilizer therapy
C: Intravenous methylprednisolone therapy
D: Oral pain reliever therapy
E: Intravenous antiviral therapy
F: Incision and drainage
G: Salt water gargle
H: Antacid therapy
I: Oral antifungal therapy
J: Inhaled corticosteroid therapy

Okay, so I have this medical question in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read through it carefully.

The patient is a 22-year-old woman who comes to the emergency department with a 5-day history of sore throat and fever. In the past three days, she's noticed a change in her voice and increased pain when swallowing. She's been taking acetaminophen since her symptoms started. Her medical history is unremarkable, and she's not on any routine medications.

Looking at her vital signs: temperature is 40.0°C, which is pretty high, like 104°F. Her pulse is 130/min, which is elevated, respirations 18/min, and BP 102/66 mmHg. Pulse oximetry is 97% on room air, so her oxygen levels are fine.

Physical exam findings: erythema, edema, and anterior displacement of the right side of the soft palate. The uvula is deviated to the left. There's a white exudate on the right tonsil. Trismus is noted, which means she has difficulty opening her mouth. Neck palpation shows enlarged, tender, mobile anterior cervical lymph nodes.

The question is about the most appropriate management in addition to antibiotic therapy. The options are A through J, each a different treatment.

Hmm. So I'm thinking about possible diagnoses. The symptoms point towards a severe throat infection. The high fever, sore throat, exudate, trismus, and uvular deviation are concerning. The displacement of the soft palate and uvula makes me think of something pushing them, like an abscess.

Wait, peritonsillar abscess maybe? Peritonsillar abscess is a complication of tonsillitis where an abscess forms beside the tonsils. Symptoms include severe sore throat, fever, trismus (difficulty opening the mouth), and a muffled voice (hot potato voice). The uvula might be swollen and displaced.

So if it's a peritonsillar abscess, the management would include antibiotics, but also possibly drainage of the abscess. Because antibiotics alone might not penetrate the abscess well, so draining it would help alleviate symptoms and speed recovery.

Looking at the options, the choices besides antibiotics are things like antifungals, antivirals, steroids, pain relievers, etc. Option F is incision and drainage. That sounds right for an abscess.

Wait, but let me consider other possibilities. Could it be infectious mononucleosis? That can cause exudative tonsillitis, but usually it's bilateral and accompanied by fatigue, lymphadenopathy, maybe hepatosplenomegaly. The unilateral presentation here might make that less likely.

Another thought: retropharyngeal abscess? That can cause similar symptoms, but the uvular deviation and soft palate displacement seem more suggestive of peritonsillar. Also, trismus is more common in peritonsillar abscess because the muscles involved in opening the jaw are affected.

So the main treatment besides antibiotics would be drainage. So the answer would be F: Incision and drainage.

Let me double-check the other options. Option E is antiviral, which would be for something like herpes, but the presentation doesn't fit. A is nystatin, which is antifungal, maybe for thrush, but she has exudate on the tonsil, which is more bacterial. C is IV steroids; sometimes used in severe infections for swelling, but not the primary management here. D is oral pain relievers, which she's already taking (acetaminophen), but that's supportive, not definitive. G is salt water gargle, which is more for mild cases. So yes, the most appropriate is F.

The patient is a 22-year-old woman presenting with a 5-day history of sore throat, fever, and recent changes in voice and increased pain with swallowing. Her vital signs show a high fever (40.0°C) and tachycardia (pulse 130/min). Physical examination reveals erythema, edema, and anterior displacement of the right soft palate, uvular deviation to the left, white exudate on the right tonsil, trismus, and enlarged, tender, mobile anterior cervical lymph nodes. These findings are suggestive of a peritonsillar abscess, a complication of tonsillitis where an abscess forms beside the tonsils. Symptoms such as severe sore throat, fever, trismus, and uvular displacement are consistent with this diagnosis.

The management of peritonsillar abscess typically involves antibiotics to address the infection, but definitive treatment also requires drainage of the abscess to alleviate symptoms and expedite recovery. Among the provided options, incision and drainage (Option F) is the most appropriate next step in addition to antibiotic therapy. Other options, such as antifungal or antiviral therapies, are not indicated here, as the presentation is consistent with a bacterial infection rather than a fungal or viral etiology. Pain relievers and supportive measures like salt water gargles are adjunctive but not definitive treatments.

Answer: F
