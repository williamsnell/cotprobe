Question:

A man and a woman were involved in a car accident that occurred when the man abruptly switched lanes in front of the woman without signaling. Unable to stop, the woman hit the man's car into a median. Immediately after the accident, as the two drivers emerged from their vehicles, a pedestrian, obviously emotional and upset from having just observed an accident, ran up to the man and shouted, "You careless driver, you. Didn't you ever learn that you're supposed to use a turn signal when you switch lanes?" The pedestrian is never identified and is not present at trial. The pedestrian's statement is

Options:

A: inadmissible, because the bystander was not involved in the accident.
B: admissible, because it is relevant to the case.
C: admissible under the excited utterance exception.
D: admissible as non-hearsay.
E: admissible, even though it is hearsay.
F: admissible under the present sense impression exception.
G: inadmissible, because it is an opinion, not a fact.
H: inadmissible, because the bystander cannot be identified and is not present at trial.
I: inadmissible, because it is prejudicial to the defendant.
J: admissible under the spontaneous statement exception.

Okay, so I have this evidence law question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me go through it step by step.

The scenario is about a car accident where a man and a woman were involved. The man switched lanes without signaling, and the woman couldn't stop, hitting his car into a median. After the accident, a pedestrian comes up, clearly emotional and upset, and shouts at the man, calling him a careless driver and mentions that he should have used a turn signal. Now, this pedestrian isn't identified and isn't present at the trial. The question is about whether the pedestrian's statement is admissible.

So, I'm trying to remember the rules of evidence, particularly regarding hearsay and its exceptions. The pedestrian's statement is being offered to prove that the man was careless, I suppose, which would be relevant to determining fault in the accident.

First, I need to determine if the statement is hearsay. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Here, the pedestrian is saying the man is careless and didn't use a turn signal. So, yes, it's being offered to prove the man was careless, which makes it hearsay.

Now, the options are about whether it's admissible under some exception. The possible exceptions I can think of are excited utterance, present sense impression, or maybe spontaneous statement. I think excited utterance applies when the statement is made under the stress of a startling event. Present sense impression is when the statement describes an event made immediately after perceiving it. Spontaneous statement is similar, perhaps under FRE 803(2) or 803(1).

Wait, also, there's the option that it's non-hearsay. If the statement is not being offered for the truth, but just to show the pedestrian was upset, but no, the context here is that it's about the man's actions, so it's for the truth.

So, considering excited utterance: FRE 803(2) says a statement is admissible if it's made under the stress of a startling event or condition. The pedestrian just saw the accident, was emotional, so that fits. The statement relates to the event (the accident) and was made while under the stress, so it's an excited utterance.

Alternatively, present sense impression under 803(1) is when the statement describes an event and is made while the declarant is perceiving it or immediately thereafter. Here, the pedestrian just saw the accident, so maybe that applies too. But the statement is about the man's action, which the pedestrian observed, so perhaps both could apply.

Wait, the key is that the statement is about the cause of the accident, which the pedestrian inferred from what they saw. So the statement is their conclusion that the man was careless. But excited utterance allows for such statements because they're made in the heat of the moment without time to fabricate.

Another option is that it's a spontaneous statement, which is similar. I think spontaneous statement is another term sometimes used for excited utterances.

Looking at the options, option C says admissible under the excited utterance exception. Option F is present sense impression. Option J is spontaneous statement exception. I think excited utterance is the more common term used here.

Alternatively, the statement might be admissible as a present sense impression because it was made immediately after the event. But I'm leaning more towards excited utterance because the declarant was under the stress of the accident.

So the pedestrian's statement would be admissible as an excited utterance, making option C correct.

Wait, but let me think again. The statement is the pedestrian's opinion that the man was careless. Wait, no, the statement is "You careless driver, you. Didn't you ever learn that you're supposed to use a turn signal when you switch lanes?" So, it's an accusation, implying that the man's failure to signal caused the accident.

Hearsay can sometimes include statements of opinion if they meet certain criteria. But excited utterance can include such statements because they're not reflective; they're made in the heat of the moment.

Another angle: the statement is not being offered by a party opponent, so it's not under 801(d)(2). It's a third party's statement.

So, yes, excited utterance applies. So the answer should be C.
</think>

The pedestrian's statement is being offered to prove the man was careless, which makes it hearsay under Federal Rule of Evidence 801. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Here, the pedestrian's statement accuses the man of being careless and failing to use a turn signal, which directly relates to the issue of fault in the accident.

To determine admissibility, we must consider exceptions to the hearsay rule. The statement qualifies as an excited utterance under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(2). Excited utterances are admissible if they are made under the stress of a startling event or condition. The pedestrian, clearly emotional and upset from witnessing the accident, made the statement immediately after the event while still under the stress of it. This fits the criteria for an excited utterance, as the statement relates to the accident and was made without time to fabricate.

Other exceptions, such as present sense impression (FRE 803(1)) or spontaneous statement, could also apply, but excited utterance is the most appropriate and commonly used exception in this context. The statement is not excluded as opinion because it was made in the heat of the moment, making it admissible under the excited utterance exception.

Thus, the pedestrian's statement is admissible under the excited utterance exception.
