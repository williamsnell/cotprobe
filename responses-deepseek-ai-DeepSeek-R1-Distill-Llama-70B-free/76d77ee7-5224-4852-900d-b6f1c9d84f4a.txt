Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a ballistic rocket being launched from the equator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down step by step.

The problem states that the rocket is launched eastward at an angle of 60 degrees from the horizontal. Its initial speed relative to Earth is 6 km/s. The question is asking for the great circle distance around the Earth that the rocket will cover. The options are given from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Wait, what's a great circle distance? Oh right, it's the shortest path on the surface of a sphere, which is the path that a plane cutting through the sphere's center would make. So it's like the distance along the equator if you're going around the Earth.

I think this has to do with orbital mechanics and projectile motion. Since it's a ballistic rocket, it's probably following an elliptical orbit around Earth, with the first part of the ellipse being its trajectory. But wait, if it's a ballistic missile, maybe it's just a suborbital trajectory, meaning it doesn't complete an orbit but re-enters the atmosphere. But the question is about the distance around the Earth it covers, which suggests it's going into orbit.

Wait, but the initial speed is 6 km/s. Oh wait, Earth's orbital speed at the surface is about 7.8 km/s. So 6 km/s is less than that, which would mean it's not achieving orbital velocity. Hmm, that's confusing. But wait, wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh no, wait, the orbital speed for a low Earth orbit is about 7.8 km/s. So 6 km/s is lower than that, which would mean that the rocket doesn't have enough speed to orbit and would instead follow a ballistic trajectory, re-entering the Earth's atmosphere. But the problem is asking about the great circle distance it covers, so maybe it's not about orbiting, but just the range of the projectile.

Wait, but projectiles on Earth usually have a range determined by their initial speed and angle, considering the Earth's curvature. But for such high speeds, like 6 km/s, the usual range equations might not apply because they're derived for much lower speeds where the Earth's curvature doesn't significantly affect the trajectory.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the rocket's motion as a projectile in the Earth's frame, but taking into account the Earth's rotation. Oh, because it's launched eastward. So Earth's rotation would give it an initial boost. Wait, but the initial speed is given with respect to Earth. So Earth's rotational speed at the equator is about 463 m/s. So the rocket's speed relative to an inertial frame would be higher because Earth is rotating eastward.

Wait, but the problem says the initial speed is 6 km/s relative to Earth. So when considering Earth's rotation, the rocket's speed in an inertial frame would be the Earth's rotational speed plus the rocket's speed. But maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps the Earth's rotation isn't directly affecting the calculation, but rather the rocket's speed is given as 6 km/s eastward relative to Earth's surface.

Wait, the problem is about the great circle distance covered. So perhaps we can model this as a projectile motion problem on a non-rotating Earth, but considering the Earth's curvature. But at 6 km/s, the rocket would be in space, so maybe it's better to think in terms of orbital mechanics.

Wait, maybe the approach is to calculate the circumference of the Earth and find out how much distance corresponds to a certain angle around the Earth based on some parameter of the rocket's motion. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the concept of orbital period or velocity to find how far it travels during its flight.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to outline what I know:

- Launch angle: 60 degrees from horizontal (eastward direction).
- Initial speed relative to Earth: 6 km/s.
- The question is about the great circle distance, so the path along the Earth's surface.

Wait, perhaps the rocket's trajectory will take it around part of the Earth, and the great circle distance is the arc length it travels before landing or completing some part of its orbit.

But I'm not sure how to approach this. Let me think about the parameters involved. The Earth's radius is about 6371 km. The rocket's initial speed is 6 km/s, direction 60 degrees from horizontal.

Wait, in projectile motion, the range is given by (v^2 sin(2θ)) / g, but that's for flat Earth approximation. But with such a high speed, the Earth's curvature must be considered. Also, the time of flight would be longer because the projectile would be in space for a while.

Alternatively, maybe we should consider the rocket's orbit. The initial speed is 6 km/s, which is less than the orbital speed at Earth's surface (7.8 km/s), so it's a suborbital trajectory. The rocket would follow an elliptical orbit with the Earth's center as one focus, but it would re-enter the atmosphere.

Wait, but if it's a ballistic missile, it goes up, reaches a peak, then comes back down, hitting a target some distance away. The distance would be the range of the missile.

But with a speed of 6 km/s, that's way higher than typical ICBMs, which have speeds around 6-7 km/s, but let's not get confused there. Wait, maybe the approach is to calculate the maximum distance it can travel, which would be when it's launched at 45 degrees, but in this case, it's 60 degrees. But again, the usual range equation doesn't apply because the speed is so high that the Earth's curvature affects the trajectory.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the rocket's speed as sufficient to reach orbit, but that's not the case. 6 km/s is less than the 7.8 km/s needed for LEO. So it's suborbital, but with an elliptical orbit where it would impact the Earth again after some time.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simpler. Maybe it's about the circumference of the Earth and seeing how much the rocket would circle around during its flight time. But that seems off because the rocket would be moving in an orbit, not along the surface.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the time the rocket is in the air (or in space) and then multiply that time by the Earth's rotational speed to find out how much distance it covers. But wait, Earth's rotation is about 463 m/s at the equator. But that might not directly apply here.

Let me think again. The rocket is fired eastward at 60 degrees with a speed of 6 km/s. The Earth's radius is about 6,371 km. So perhaps the rocket's trajectory will take it into space, and upon re-entry, it'll land somewhere on the Earth's surface, and the distance between launch and impact is the great circle distance.

So to find that, I need to calculate the range of the rocket, considering it's a ballistic missile with a very high initial speed.

But I'm not sure about the exact formula for such a high-speed projectile. Maybe I can model it using orbital mechanics. Let me think: the rocket's initial speed is 6 km/s at 60 degrees inclination from the horizontal.

Wait, in orbital mechanics, the velocity components are important. The horizontal component would contribute to the orbital velocity, and the vertical component would determine the apogee.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to outline the steps I think are needed:

1. Break the initial velocity into horizontal and vertical components.
   - V0x = V1 * cos(60°)
   - V0y = V1 * sin(60°)
   So V0x = 6 * 0.5 = 3 km/s
   V0y = 6 * (√3/2) ≈ 5.196 km/s

2. The horizontal component of velocity would be similar to the circular orbital velocity needed for a certain altitude. The vertical component would determine how high the rocket goes.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum distance is achieved when the rocket's trajectory takes it to the opposite side of the Earth, but that's not necessarily the case.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the time the rocket is in flight. But how?

Wait, another approach: For a projectile launched with speed v at angle θ, the maximum distance (range) on a flat Earth is (v² sin(2θ)) / g. But that's when air resistance is neglected and Earth's curvature is ignored. With v=6 km/s, this would give:

v² = (6,000 m/s)^2 = 36,000,000 m²/s²
sin(120°) = √3/2 ≈ 0.866
So R = (36e6 * 0.866) / 9.81 ≈ (31,176,000) / 9.81 ≈ ~3,177,000 meters, which is about 3,177 km.

But this is the flat Earth approximation, which is not valid here because the Earth's radius is 6,371 km, and the rocket's range is a significant fraction of that. So the flat Earth approximation isn't applicable.

So I need a better approach. Maybe using orbital mechanics.

Wait, when you launch a projectile with some speed, it will follow an elliptical orbit with the Earth's center as one focus. The perigee is the lowest point (Earth's surface), and the apogee is the highest point. The distance along the surface between launch and impact would be the angle subtended by the chord connecting those two points, multiplied by the Earth's radius.

Hmm, but I'm not sure how to calculate that angle. Let me think about the parameters.

The initial speed is 6 km/s at 60 degrees. The horizontal component is 3 km/s. Wait, the Earth's rotational speed at the equator is about 463 m/s (since 2πR/T, where T=24*3600 s, R≈6.371e6 m. So v = 2π*6.371e6 / (86400) ≈ 463 m/s). So the rocket's initial speed relative to Earth's surface is higher in the eastward direction.

Wait, but does that matter? Because the Earth is rotating, the rocket's speed relative to an inertial frame is Earth's rotational speed plus the rocket's launch speed. So in the eastward direction, the total speed would be 463 + 3000 = 3463 m/s? Wait, 3 km/s is 3000 m/s. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the right way to add them. Alternatively, maybe the Earth's rotation gives the rocket an initial boost, so the rocket's speed in inertial frame is 6 km/s + Earth's rotational speed. But I'm not certain if this is necessary for the problem, since the initial speed is given relative to Earth.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the Earth as non-rotating, so we can ignore the Earth's rotation. That might simplify things.

Wait, but the problem says the rocket is launched eastward, so maybe the Earth's rotation does play a role. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to think differently.

In the inertial frame, the rocket's initial velocity is 6 km/s eastward, plus Earth's rotational speed. But wait, the Earth's rotational speed is about 463 m/s at the equator. So the rocket's speed in the inertial frame is 6,000 + 463 = 6,463 m/s eastward. But wait, that's a simplistic approach. Actually, the Earth's rotational speed is a vector, so adding vectors. But since both are in the same direction (eastward), the speeds add up.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering the Earth's rotation, so the rocket's initial speed in the inertial frame is higher. But I'm not sure how that affects the trajectory in terms of the great circle distance. Alternatively, perhaps the Earth's rotation doesn't affect the distance because we're looking for the distance along the surface, which is a geodesic, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is much simpler. The great circle distance is determined by the rocket's speed and the time it takes to go around the Earth. But that would imply the rocket is in orbit, but 6 km/s is less than the 7.8 km/s needed for LEO. So it can't make a full orbit; it would re-enter.

Wait, perhaps we can calculate how much time the rocket is in the air, and then see how much angular distance is covered due to Earth's rotation during that time. Then, the great circle distance would be that angle multiplied by Earth's radius.

But this approach would consider that the rocket is moving eastward, and Earth is rotating eastward. So perhaps during the rocket's flight, Earth rotates some degrees, and the rocket's impact point is ahead in that direction.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me try to outline this approach.

1. Calculate the time of flight for the rocket.
2. During this time, Earth rotates, so the distance moved would be (angular velocity) * (time of flight) * Earth's radius.

But to calculate the time of flight, I need to know how long the rocket is in the air before landing. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the rocket's flight time is determined by its trajectory, which is an ellipse. The time to go from launch to impact would be determined by the orbital period of that ellipse, but that's complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should model the rocket's trajectory as an elliptical orbit where the perigee is at Earth's surface (launch point), and the apogee is the highest point in the trajectory. The time to reach apogee and come back would determine the flight time.

The formula for the period of an elliptical orbit is T = 2π√(a³/μ), where a is the semi-major axis, and μ is Earth's standard gravitational parameter (≈3.986e14 m³/s²).

But to find 'a', the semi-major axis, I can use the vis-viva equation:

v² = μ (2/r - 1/a)

At launch, the rocket is at r = Earth's radius (R = 6.371e6 m), and its speed is v = 6e3 m/s. But wait, the speed is at an angle of 60 degrees, so the direction matters. But perhaps in the vis-viva equation, we can use the speed in the radial direction, but I'm not sure. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating things.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy can help determine the apogee, and from there, find the semi-major axis.

The initial kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², and the gravitational potential energy is -μm/r. The total mechanical energy is E = K + U = (1/2)mv² - μm/r.

The semi-major axis a is related to the energy by:

E = - μm/(2a)

So setting them equal:

(1/2)mv² - μm/r = - μm/(2a)

Divide both sides by m:

(1/2)v² - μ/r = - μ/(2a)

Rearranging:

(1/2)v² = μ/(2a) - μ/r

Multiply both sides by 2:

v² = μ/(a) - 2μ/r

Wait, perhaps I should handle the algebra correctly.

Wait, let me correct that step:

From E = (1/2)v² - μ/r = - μ/(2a)

So,

(1/2)v² - μ/r = - μ/(2a)

Multiply both sides by 2a:

a v² - 2a μ / r = - μ

Bring all terms to one side:

a v² - 2a μ / r + μ = 0

Hmm, this seems messy. Maybe I can factor out μ:

a v² + μ ( - 2a / r + 1 ) = 0

Wait, perhaps it's easier to solve for a.

From E = - μ/(2a) = (1/2)v² - μ/r

So,

- μ/(2a) = (1/2)v² - μ/r

Multiply both sides by 2a:

- μ = a v² - 2a μ / r

Bring all terms to left side:

- μ - a v² + 2a μ / r = 0

Factor:

2a μ / r - a v² - μ = 0

Hmm, perhaps I should solve for a:

Let me rearrange the equation:

(1/2)v² - μ/r = - μ/(2a)

Multiply both sides by -2a:

- a v² + 2a μ / r = μ

Then,

- a v² + (2a μ)/r = μ

Factor a:

a ( -v² + 2μ / r ) = μ

Thus,

a = μ / ( -v² + 2μ / r )

Wait, that can't be right because the denominator would be negative. Let me check my steps again.

Wait, let's start over.

The vis-viva equation is:

v² = μ (2/r - 1/a)

We can solve for 1/a:

1/a = (2/r) - (v²)/μ

So,

a = 1 / [ (2/r) - (v²)/μ ]

Plugging in the numbers:

r = 6.371e6 m

v = 6e3 m/s

μ = 3.986e14 m³/s²

Compute 2/r:

2 / (6.371e6) ≈ 3.138e-7 m^-1

Compute v²/μ:

(6e3)^2 / 3.986e14 = 36e6 / 3.986e14 ≈ 9.035e-9 s²/m²

So,

1/a = 3.138e-7 - 9.035e-9 ≈ 3.129e-7 m^-1

Thus,

a ≈ 1 / 3.129e-7 ≈ 3.195e6 meters, or 3,195 km.

Wait, that's the semi-major axis of the orbit.

Now, the period T is:

T = 2π √(a³/μ)

Compute a³: (3.195e6)^3 ≈ 3.195^3 * 1e18 = approx 32.76 * 1e18 = 3.276e19 m³

Now, μ = 3.986e14 m³/s²

So,

a³/μ = 3.276e19 / 3.986e14 ≈ 8.22e4 s²

√(a³/μ) = √(8.22e4) ≈ 287 s

So,

T = 2π * 287 ≈ 1804 seconds, which
