Okay, I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about a first-order reaction. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So the reaction given is C₂H₄O → CH₄ + CO. It's a first-order reaction, and the specific rate constant is 0.0123 min⁻¹ at 415°C. The question is asking for the percentage of the original C₂H₄O that will be decomposed after heating at 415°C for 1 hour.

Hmm, right. First-order reactions... I remember that the rate depends on the concentration of one reactant. The formula for the concentration of a reactant in a first-order reaction over time is something like ln([A]₀/[A]) = kt, where [A]₀ is the initial concentration, [A] is the concentration at time t, k is the rate constant, and t is time.

Wait, but the question is asking for the percentage decomposed. So I think I can find the remaining concentration and subtract from 100% to get the decomposed part.

Let me think about the steps. First, calculate the remaining [A] after time t, then find the percentage that's decomposed.

So given:
k = 0.0123 min⁻¹
t = 1 hour. Oh wait, I should convert that into minutes because the rate constant is in per minute. 1 hour is 60 minutes.

So t = 60 min.

Using the first-order formula: ln([A]₀/[A]) = kt.

Let me plug in the numbers. [A]₀ is the initial concentration, and [A] is after 60 minutes.

So ln([A]₀/[A]) = 0.0123 * 60 = ?

Calculating that: 0.0123 * 60. Let me compute. 0.0123 * 60 = 0.738.

So ln([A]₀/[A]) = 0.738.

I can rearrange this to find [A]/[A]₀ = e^(-0.738).

Wait, because [A]₀/[A] = e^(0.738), so [A] = [A]₀ * e^(-0.738).

Let me compute e^0.738. I think I remember that e^0.7 is about 2.0138, but let me get a better approximation. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate it more accurately.

Wait, 0.738. Let me see: e^0.7 is about 2.01375, e^0.73 is approximately 2.0789, e^0.735 is around 2.086, and e^0.738 maybe about 2.09. Wait, perhaps a better way is to use a calculator function, but since I'm just thinking, I'll proceed.

Alternatively, using a Taylor series or exact value, but maybe it's easier to remember that ln(2) is about 0.693, so 0.738 is a bit more than ln(2), so e^0.738 is a bit more than 2. So maybe approximately 2.09.

Wait, wait, no, because 0.738 is about 0.693 + 0.045. So e^0.738 = e^(0.693 + 0.045) = e^0.693 * e^0.045. e^0.693 is 2, and e^0.045 is approximately 1.046. So 2 * 1.046 is 2.092. So approximately 2.092.

So e^0.738 ≈ 2.092, so [A] is [A]₀ * (1/2.092) ≈ 0.4785 [A]₀.

Wait, wait no. Wait, because [A] = [A]₀ * e^(-kt) = [A]₀ * e^(-0.738) = [A]₀ / e^(0.738) ≈ [A]₀ / 2.092 ≈ 0.4785 [A]₀.

So after 60 minutes, 47.85% of the original C₂H₄O remains. So the percentage decomposed is 100% - 47.85% = 52.15%.

Wait, but let me check my calculations again. Maybe I made an error in the exponent.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute e^0.738 more accurately. Let me see. Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator. Oh wait, I can't use a calculator, but I can think of it as:

0.738 is approximately 0.7 + 0.038.

We know that e^0.7 is about 2.01375.

e^0.738 = e^(0.7) * e^(0.038).

e^0.038: Let's compute using the Taylor series for e^x around x=0.

e^x = 1 + x + x²/2! + x³/3! + x^4/4! + ...

x=0.038.

So e^0.038 ≈ 1 + 0.038 + (0.038)^2 / 2 + (0.038)^3 /6 + (0.038)^4 /24.

Calculating each term:

0.038 = 0.038

(0.038)^2 = 0.001444; divided by 2: 0.000722

(0.038)^3 = 0.000054872; divided by 6: ~0.000009145

(0.038)^4 = 0.000002085136; divided by 24: ~0.0000000869.

Adding these up:

1 + 0.038 = 1.038

+ 0.000722 → 1.038722

+ 0.000009145 → 1.038731

+ 0.0000000869 → ~1.0387311.

So e^0.038 ≈ 1.03873.

So e^0.738 = e^0.7 * e^0.038 ≈ 2.01375 * 1.03873.

Let me multiply that out.

2.01375 * 1.03873.

Compute 2 * 1.03873 = 2.07746.

0.01375 * 1.03873 ≈ let's compute 0.01 * 1.03873 = 0.0103873, 0.00375 *1.03873 ≈ 0.003897.

So adding those: 0.0103873 + 0.003897 = 0.0142843.

So total is 2.07746 + 0.0142843 ≈ 2.09174.

So e^0.738 ≈ 2.09174.

So [A]/[A]₀ = 1/2.09174 ≈ 0.4785 or 47.85%.

So the percentage decomposed is 100 - 47.85 = 52.15%.

Looking at the options, option A is 52.1%, which matches. Option J is 50%, which is close but not as precise.

Wait, but wait another thing. Wait, perhaps I should calculate the exact value without approximations to be precise. Alternatively, maybe I can recall the exact value or use a better approach.

Wait, another way: using the formula for percentage decomposed.

In a first-order reaction, the fraction remaining is e^(-kt). So the fraction decomposed is 1 - e^(-kt).

So let me compute kt = 0.0123 min⁻¹ * 60 min = 0.738.

So 1 - e^(-0.738) is the fraction decomposed.

Compute e^(-0.738) = 1/e^(0.738) ≈ 1/2.09174 ≈ 0.4785.

So 1 - 0.4785 = 0.5215, or 52.15%, which is approximately 52.1%, so option A.

So the correct answer should be A: 52.1%.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze the first-order reaction using the formula:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{[A]_0}{[A]}\right) = kt
\]

where:
- \(k = 0.0123 \, \text{min}^{-1}\) (rate constant),
- \(t = 60 \, \text{min}\) (1 hour converted to minutes),
- \([A]_0\) is the initial concentration of \(C_2H_4O\),
- \([A]\) is the concentration of \(C_2H_4O\) at time \(t\).

### Step 1: Calculate \(kt\)
\[
kt = 0.0123 \times 60 = 0.738
\]

### Step 2: Solve for the fraction of \(C_2H_4O\) remaining
Rearranging the formula:
\[
\frac{[A]}{[A]_0} = e^{-kt} = e^{-0.738}
\]

Using approximations for \(e^{-0.738}\), we find:
\[
e^{-0.738} \approx 0.4785
\]

Thus, about 47.85% of the original \(C_2H_4O\) remains after 1 hour.

### Step 3: Calculate the percentage decomposed
The percentage of \(C_2H_4O\) decomposed is:
\[
\text{Percentage decomposed} = 100\% - \text{Percentage remaining} = 100\% - 47.85\% = 52.15\%
\]

### Step 4: Match with the closest option
The closest option to 52.15% is **52.1%**, which corresponds to **Option A**.
