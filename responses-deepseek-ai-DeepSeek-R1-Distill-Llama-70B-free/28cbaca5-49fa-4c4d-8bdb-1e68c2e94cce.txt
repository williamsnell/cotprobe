Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"When the Portuguese go from Macao in China to Japan, they carry much white silk, gold, musk, and porcelain: and they bring from Japan nothing but silver. They have a great carrack which goes there every year and she brings from there every year about six hundred coins: and all this silver of Japan, and two hundred thousand coins more in silver which they bring yearly out of India, they employ to their great advantage in China: and they bring from there gold, musk, silk, copper, porcelains, and many other things very costly and gilded.
When the Portuguese come to Canton in China to traffic, they must remain there but certain days: and when they come in at the gate of the city, they must enter their names in a book, and when they go out at night they must put out their names. They may not lie in the town all night, but must lie in their boats outside of the town. And, their time expired, if any man remains there, he is imprisoned."

Okay, so I've got this history question here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about trade patterns in the period between 1450 and 1750 C.E. The passage provided is from Ralph Fitch's account of his travels to the Far East in 1599. The first paragraph talks about the Portuguese trading between Macao, China, and Japan. They bring goods like white silk, gold, musk, and porcelain to Japan and bring back silver. It mentions a great carrack (a type of ship) that goes every year and brings about six hundred coins. Then, in China, they use this silver along with more silver from India to buy other goods like gold, silk, copper, porcelain, etc.

The question is asking which development from that time period most directly undid these trade patterns. The options are A through D: the eastward expansion of Russia, Portuguese conquest of India, the establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate, and the Spanish conquest of Mexico.

Hmm, okay. So I need to figure out what event would disrupt the Portuguese trade as described. The Portuguese are trading between China and Japan, using silver from both Japan and India to buy Chinese goods. So if something happened that stopped this flow, that would undo the trade patterns.

Looking at the options:

A: Eastward expansion of Russia. I'm not sure how that directly affects the Portuguese trade in East Asia. Russia expanding east might affect Siberia and maybe trade routes in that area, but I don't see a direct link to the Portuguese-China-Japan trade.

B: Portuguese conquest of India. Wait, but the Portuguese actually did establish themselves in India, especially Goa, as a major base. But the passage says they bring silver from India as well. So if the Portuguese had already taken India, perhaps that's how they got the silver. But if they lost India, that would affect their trade. But the option is about the Portuguese conquering India, which they did, but that might have been part of establishing their trade, not undoing it. Unless this option refers to something else.

C: Establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate. I remember that the Tokugawa period in Japan was known for sakoku, the closing of the country. They severely limited foreign trade and interaction, expelling most foreigners except for the Dutch who were confined to an island. If the Tokugawa came to power and closed Japan off, that would directly impact the Portuguese trade with Japan. Because if Japan stops allowing the Portuguese to come, the silver from Japan would no longer be available, disrupting the trade pattern described.

D: Spanish conquest of Mexico. The Spanish conquest happened in the early 16th century. Mexico was a major source of silver for Spain. But how does that affect the Portuguese trade? The Portuguese were using their own silver sources, from Japan and India. If the Spanish got more silver from Mexico, maybe it affected global silver supplies, but I'm not sure if that directly undid the Portuguese trade patterns in East Asia. It might have influenced other parts of the world economy, but the question is about what directly undid the Portuguese's specific trade.

So putting it together, the Portuguese were trading with Japan, bringing silver back to China. If Japan closed its ports, which the Tokugawa Shogunate did, that would stop the Portuguese from getting Japanese silver, thus disrupting their ability to trade in China as described. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me think again. The passage says the Portuguese bring silver from Japan and India to China. If the Tokugawa Shogunate stopped Japanese trade, the Portuguese would lose that silver source. But they might still get silver from India. But the question is about what undid the trade patterns, which were bringing silver from both places. So the main disruption would be losing the Japanese silver, which was a significant part.

Yes, I think option C is the right answer.

The question focuses on identifying which development from 1450–1750 C.E. most directly disrupted the Portuguese trade patterns described in the passage. The Portuguese traded between Macao, China, and Japan, using silver from both Japan and India to purchase Chinese goods. The key is to determine which event would directly interfere with this specific trade network.

- **Option A**: The eastward expansion of Russia primarily affected Siberia and trade routes in that region, which does not directly impact the Portuguese trade in East Asia.
- **Option B**: The Portuguese conquest of India was integral to their trade network, as it provided silver for their transactions in China. This event supported, rather than disrupted, their trade patterns.
- **Option C**: The establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate in Japan led to the sakoku policy, which closed Japan to foreign trade and expelled most foreigners. This directly disrupted the Portuguese trade with Japan, cutting off their access to Japanese silver, a critical component of their trade strategy.
- **Option D**: The Spanish conquest of Mexico affected silver production in the Americas but did not directly interfere with the Portuguese trade network in East Asia.

The most direct disruption to the Portuguese trade patterns was the establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate, which closed Japan to foreign trade and severed the Portuguese access to Japanese silver.
