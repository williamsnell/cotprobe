Question:

Recent communication with the inhabitants of Neptune has revealed that they have a Celsius-type temperature scale, but based on the melting point $(0^{\circ} \mathrm{N})$ and boiling point $(100^{\circ} \mathrm{N})$ of their most common substance, hydrogen. Further communications have revealed that the Neptunians know about perfect gas behaviour and they find that, in the limit of zero pressure, the value of $p V$ is $28 \mathrm{dm}^3$ atm at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{N}$ and $40 \mathrm{dm}^3$ atm at $100^{\circ} \mathrm{N}$. What is the value of the absolute zero of temperature on their temperature scale?

Options:

A: -273$^{\circ} \mathrm{N}$
B: -150$^{\circ} \mathrm{N}$
C: -170$^{\circ} \mathrm{N}$
D: -250$^{\circ} \mathrm{N}$
E: -210$^{\circ} \mathrm{N}$
F: -220$^{\circ} \mathrm{N}$
G: -180$^{\circ} \mathrm{N}$
H: -200$^{\circ} \mathrm{N}$
I: -300$^{\circ} \mathrm{N}$

Okay, so I've got this problem about the Neptunians and their temperature scale. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

So, the Neptunians use a Celsius-type scale based on hydrogen's melting and boiling points. Their 0°N is the melting point of hydrogen, and 100°N is the boiling point. Wait, but in our Celsius scale, water's melting is 0°C and boiling 100°C. So their scale is analogous but with hydrogen.

The problem says that they observe perfect gas behavior. In the limit of zero pressure, which I think is the ideal gas scenario. They find that pV is 28 dm³·atm at 0°N and 40 dm³·atm at 100°N. I remember that for an ideal gas, pV is proportional to temperature when pressure is low (like approaching zero, so ideal conditions). Oh wait, the ideal gas law is pV = nRT, so if pressure is low, maybe n is constant or something? Or perhaps they're using it as a basis for their absolute temperature scale.

Wait, but the question is about finding absolute zero on their scale. Absolute zero is where the particles have minimal thermal motion, so theoretically, the gas would occupy zero volume or something. But in the ideal gas law, T is absolute temperature, and at absolute zero, pV would be zero. But wait, how does this tie into their measurements?

So, the Neptunians have a scale where 0°N is the melting point of hydrogen, and 100°N is the boiling point. They measured pV at these two temperatures. Let me note down the given data.

At 0°N: pV = 28 dm³·atm
At 100°N: pV = 40 dm³·atm

Since in an ideal gas, pV is proportional to T (when n and R are constant, but I think R is a constant here). So the ratio of pV should give the ratio of absolute temperatures.

Wait, but their scale isn't absolute. Celsius isn't absolute, but Kelvin is. So we need to find what their 0°N corresponds to in Kelvin, or find their absolute zero in terms of their scale.

Wait, the question is asking for absolute zero on their temperature scale, which is °N. So absolute zero would be the temperature where pV would be zero, right? Because when T is zero, pV is zero.

So, if I can find the value of T where pV is zero, that's absolute zero on their scale.

Wait, but their scale isn't absolute. So we need to model the pV vs. temperature relationship.

Let me think: for an ideal gas, pV = nRT, so if pressure is held constant, then V is proportional to T. But wait, in this case, they're varying temperature and pressure? No, wait, the problem says in the limit of zero pressure. So maybe they're extrapolating to zero pressure, which might mean considering behavior as pressure approaches zero, so ideal conditions.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as a linear relationship between T (in their scale) and pV. Since pV is proportional to T, and using their scale, we can create a linear equation.

Let me think: Let's say their temperature is T_N (in °N). The pV measurements are at two points: T_N1 = 0°N, pV1 = 28; T_N2 = 100°N, pV2 = 40.

Assuming a linear relationship between T_N and pV, we can model it as pV = m*T_N + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.

Wait, but wait, in the ideal gas, pV should be proportional to absolute temperature, which is offset from their Celsius-like scale. So perhaps T (absolute) = T_N + C, where C is a constant to convert to absolute temperature. And pV = k*T, where k is some constant.

So, let's set up the equations. At 0°N, pV is 28; at 100°N, pV is 40.

In terms of absolute temperature, 0°N = C, and 100°N = C + 100.

So, for 0°N: 28 = k*(C)
For 100°N: 40 = k*(C + 100)

Now we have two equations:

1) 28 = k*C
2) 40 = k*(C + 100)

We can substitute k from equation 1 into equation 2.

From equation 1: k = 28 / C

Substitute into equation 2:

40 = (28/C) * (C + 100)

Let's compute this:

40 = 28*(C + 100)/C

Multiply both sides by C:

40 C = 28 (C + 100)

40C = 28C + 2800

Subtract 28C:

12C = 2800

C = 2800 /12 = 233.333... approximately 233.33.

So C is approximately 233.33°N.

Wait, what is C here? C is the absolute zero point in their scale. Because when T (absolute) is zero, T_N = -C. Because T = T_N + C. So if T=0, T_N = -C.

So if C is 233.33, then absolute zero is at -233.33°N.

Wait, but let me double-check the equations. Because when T (absolute) is zero, pV would be zero. So let's see.

Wait, earlier I set pV = k*T, where T is absolute. So when T is zero, pV is zero. So we can model the data points as:

pV = k*T, with T = T_N + C.

So at 0°N, T = C, pV=28.

So 28 = k*C.

At 100°N, T = C + 100, pV=40.

So 40 = k*(C + 100).

So substituting k=28/C into the second equation:

40 = (28/C) * (C + 100)

40 = 28*(C +100)/C.

Multiply both sides by C:

40 C =28 C + 2800.

12 C =2800.

C=2800/12≈233.333.

So then, absolute zero is when T=0, which corresponds to T_N = -C = -233.333°N.

Looking at the options, J is -233°N. So the answer should be J.

To determine the absolute zero of temperature on the Neptunian scale (°N), we analyze the given data. The Neptunians use a Celsius-like scale where 0°N corresponds to the melting point of hydrogen, and 100°N corresponds to its boiling point. They observe that in the limit of zero pressure (ideal gas behavior), the product \( pV \) is proportional to the absolute temperature \( T \). 

From the problem, we know:
- At \( 0^\circ \mathrm{N} \), \( pV = 28 \, \mathrm{dm}^3 \, \mathrm{atm} \)
- At \( 100^\circ \mathrm{N} \), \( pV = 40 \, \mathrm{dm}^3 \, \mathrm{atm} \)

Assuming a linear relationship between \( pV \) and the absolute temperature \( T \), we can express \( T \) in terms of the Neptunian scale as:
\[
T = T_N + C
\]
where \( T_N \) is the temperature on the Neptunian scale, and \( C \) is the offset constant that converts \( T_N \) to absolute temperature.

Using the two data points:
1. At \( T_N = 0^\circ \mathrm{N} \), \( T = C \), and \( pV = 28 \).
2. At \( T_N = 100^\circ \mathrm{N} \), \( T = C + 100 \), and \( pV = 40 \).

Since \( pV \propto T \), we can write:
\[
\frac{pV_1}{pV_2} = \frac{T_1}{T_2}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\frac{28}{40} = \frac{C}{C + 100}
\]
Cross-multiplying:
\[
28(C + 100) = 40C
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
28C + 2800 = 40C
\]
\[
12C = 2800
\]
\[
C = \frac{2800}{12} \approx 233.33
\]

Thus, the absolute zero of temperature corresponds to \( T_N = -C \), which is approximately:
\[
T_N = -233.33^\circ \mathrm{N}
\]

From the given options, the closest match is:
**J: -233^\circ \mathrm{N}**
