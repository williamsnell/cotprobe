Question:

Dr. Carl Carlson is a licensed psychologist and professor in the psychology department at a large university. He is approached by a graduate student, Marla M., age 36, who asks him if he’d like to attend a baseball game on Friday night. Dr. Carlson is divorced and finds Marla to be a very attractive woman. In terms of ethical guidelines, if Dr. Carlson accepts Marla’s invitation, he will be:

Options:

A: acting ethically as long as he discloses the relationship to his colleagues in the psychology department.
B: clearly violating ethical guidelines.
C: acting unethically only if their relationship affects Marla's academic performance.
D: acting ethically as long as Marla is a student in a department other than the psychology department and will not be taking any classes in the psychology department.
E: acting ethically as long as he does not become sexually involved with Marla until she is no longer affiliated with the university.
F: acting ethically since he is not the one who initiated a potential relationship.
G: clearly violating ethical guidelines, unless he has received permission from the university.
H: acting ethically as long as he does not date any other students in the university.
I: acting unethically only if Marla is currently enrolled in one of his classes.
J: acting ethically as long as he maintains a professional relationship with Marla.

Okay, so I have this question about ethical guidelines in psychology, specifically involving a professor and a graduate student. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the scenario: Dr. Carl Carlson is a licensed psychologist and a professor in the psychology department. A graduate student named Marla M., who's 36, asks him to a baseball game. Dr. Carlson is divorced and finds Marla attractive. The question is about the ethics of him accepting her invitation.

I remember that ethical guidelines in academia, especially in psychology, have strict rules about relationships between professors and students. The main concern is power dynamics and potential exploitation. Professors have a position of authority over their students, which can create an unequal relationship.

Looking at the options, I need to figure out which one is correct. Let's go through each option.

Option A: Acting ethically as long as he discloses to colleagues. Hmm, I don't think disclosure to colleagues is sufficient. The issue is more about the inherent power imbalance, not just transparency. Plus, the guidelines probably prohibit such relationships regardless of disclosure.

Option B: Clearly violating ethical guidelines. This seems likely because professors shouldn't date students they have authority over. But I should check other options to be sure.

Option C: Unethical only if it affects Marla's performance. No, the ethical violation is the existence of the relationship itself, not just the consequences. Even if her grades are fine, it's still problematic because of the potential for bias or favoritism, and the power dynamic.

Option D: Ethical if Marla is in another department and won't take psych classes. Wait, if Marla is a graduate student in another department, maybe that's different. But the question says she's in the psychology department, so this doesn't apply. So D might not be the right choice here.

Option E: Ethical if he doesn't get sexually involved until she's no longer affiliated. This sounds like it's following the APA guidelines which might allow relationships after the professional relationship ends. But I think the issue is that even dating (non-sexual) could be problematic while she's a student, especially in the same department.

Option F: Ethical since he didn't initiate. No, the initiation doesn't matter. The position of power does. Whether he initiates or not, accepting an invitation could still be a violation.

Option G: Clearly violating unless permission from university. I don't think universities allow such relationships even with permission. The guidelines are usually strict about no romantic or sexual relationships with students under one's supervision.

Option H: Ethical as long as he doesn't date other students. That doesn't make it ethical. Dating one student is still a problem regardless of others.

Option I: Unethical only if she's in his class. Wait, the question says Marla is a graduate student. If she's in his class, that's a direct supervisory role. But even if she's not in his class but still in the same department, there might be indirect power dynamics, like departmental decisions affecting her. So I'm not sure if I is correct because it narrows it down to being in his class.

Option J: Ethical as long as he maintains a professional relationship. No, because going on a date is not professional. The personal involvement crosses the boundary.

Wait, going back. The question is about whether attending a baseball game is an ethical violation. So, is accepting such an invitation considered a violation?

In many ethical guidelines, any kind of romantic or sexual relationship with a current student is prohibited, especially when there's a supervisory relationship. Even if Marla isn't in his class, as a grad student in the same department, he might have some influence over her academic career, like being on her thesis committee or having departmental meetings where her performance is discussed.

So, attending a baseball game could be seen as the start of a personal relationship, which is not allowed. Therefore, accepting the invitation would be a violation.

Looking back at the options, B says clearly violating, which seems correct. But wait, what about E which talks about not being involved until she's no longer affiliated. If he waits until she's done with the program, maybe that's acceptable. But the question is about accepting the invitation now, so B would be the case.

Wait, another thought. The question is about whether he's violating guidelines by accepting the invitation. It's possible that going to a baseball game is just a friendly gesture, but in the context of a professor-student relationship, any social engagement can blur the lines and create an inappropriate relationship.

So yes, accepting would be a violation. Therefore, the correct answer is B: clearly violating ethical guidelines.
</think>

Dr. Carl Carlson, a licensed psychologist and professor, is approached by Marla M., a 36-year-old graduate student in the psychology department, who invites him to a baseball game. The ethical implications of Dr. Carlson accepting this invitation must be evaluated based on the power dynamics and professional boundaries inherent in the professor-student relationship.

Ethical guidelines in academia, particularly in psychology, strictly prohibit romantic or sexual relationships between professors and students due to the inherent power imbalance and potential for exploitation. Even social engagements like attending a baseball game can blur professional boundaries and create an inappropriate relationship. The initiation of such a relationship, regardless of whether it is sexual or not, violates ethical standards because it risks undermining the professional integrity and objectivity of the professor-student dynamic.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Disclosure to colleagues does not resolve the ethical violation, as the issue lies in the power imbalance, not just transparency.
- **B**: This is correct, as accepting the invitation clearly violates ethical guidelines by crossing professional boundaries.
- **C**: The violation exists regardless of whether Marla's academic performance is affected; the relationship itself is the issue.
- **D**: Marla is in the psychology department, so this option does not apply.
- **E**: While waiting until Marla is no longer affiliated with the university might be acceptable, accepting the invitation now is still a violation.
- **F**: The initiation of the relationship is irrelevant; the power dynamic remains problematic.
- **G**: Universities typically do not permit such relationships, even with permission.
- **H**: Dating one student is still unethical, regardless of whether he dates others.
- **I**: The violation is not limited to Marla being in his class; it applies to any student in the department due to potential indirect influence.
- **J**: Maintaining a professional relationship is not possible if personal involvement begins.

Thus, accepting the invitation to the baseball game is a clear violation of ethical guidelines. 

Answer: B
