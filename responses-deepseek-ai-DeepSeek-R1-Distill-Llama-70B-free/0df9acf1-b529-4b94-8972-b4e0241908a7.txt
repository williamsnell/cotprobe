Okay, so I've got this problem here that asks me to find the smallest positive integer that leaves specific remainders when divided by 3, 5, and 7. Let me see how to approach this.

The problem says:

- When divided by 3, the remainder is 2.
- When divided by 5, the remainder is 3.
- When divided by 7, the remainder is 1.

Hmm, I think this is a Chinese Remainder Theorem problem. But I'm not too familiar with that, so maybe I can solve it step by step.

Let me denote the number we're looking for as N.

So according to the problem:

N ≡ 2 mod 3
N ≡ 3 mod 5
N ≡ 1 mod 7

I need to find the smallest N that satisfies all three conditions.

Maybe I can solve two of the congruences first and then see how it fits with the third.

Let's start with the first two:

N ≡ 2 mod 3 --> So possible numbers are 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29, 32, 35, etc.

N ≡ 3 mod 5 --> So possible numbers are 3, 8, 13, 18, 23, 28, 33, 38, etc.

Looking for the smallest common number in both lists. Let me list them:

From mod 3: 2,5,8,11,14,17,20,23,26,29,32,35...

From mod 5:3,8,13,18,23,28,33,38...

I see that 8 is in both. So the numbers that satisfy both conditions are numbers congruent to 8 mod 15 (since 3 and 5 are coprime, their LCM is 15). So N can be written as 15k + 8, where k is an integer.

So N = 15k + 8.

Now, this N must also satisfy N ≡ 1 mod 7.

So substituting, 15k + 8 ≡ 1 mod 7.

Let me compute 15 mod 7: 15 /7 is 2 with remainder 1, so 15 ≡1 mod7. So 15k ≡k mod7.

So the equation becomes: k + 8 ≡1 mod7.

Simplify: k ≡1 -8 mod7 → 1-8 is -7, which is 0 mod7. So k ≡0 mod7.

Which means k is a multiple of 7, so k=7m, where m is an integer.

So substituting back into N: N=15*(7m) +8=105m +8.

We need the smallest positive integer, so m=0 gives N=8, but let's check if this satisfies all conditions.

Wait, N=8:

8 divided by 3 is 2 with remainder 2. Good.

8 divided by 5 is 1 with remainder 3. Good.

8 divided by 7 is 1 with remainder 1? No, because 7*1=7, 8-7=1. Oh wait, yes! 8 mod7 is 1. So 8 does satisfy all three conditions.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check because I thought the answer might be higher. Let me check the options given.

Looking back, the options include 8 (option A). So is 8 the correct answer?

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the steps.

Wait, I thought N=15k+8. For k=0, N=8. Let's test:

8 mod3=2. Correct.

8 mod5=3. Correct.

8 mod7=1. Correct.

So 8 satisfies all three conditions. So why is the option B 31? Because I thought perhaps I made a mistake somewhere, but according to this, 8 is the smallest.

But looking at the options, option A is 8, which would be the correct answer. So why is the question giving all these other options? Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the solving process. Let me go through it again.

We have:

N ≡2 mod3 --> N=3a +2.

N ≡3 mod5 --> N=5b +3.

Set them equal: 3a+2=5b+3 →3a=5b+1.

Looking for integer a,b.

So 3a =5b+1 → Let's find a solution where a and b are integers. Let's try b=1: 5*1+1=6 →3a=6 →a=2. So a=2, b=1.

So N=3*2+2=8. So that's correct.

Now, check N=8 mod7:8 mod7=1. So it satisfies all conditions. So 8 is the smallest such number.

But wait, let me check the options again:

Options are:

A: 8

B:31

C:10

D:37

E:23

F:12

G:14

H:52

I:15

J:26

So the correct answer should be A:8. But why is 8 an option when I thought it's correct?

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the initial assumption. Let me check the problem again.

Wait the problem says:

"remainder of 2 when divided by 3"

8 divided by3 is 2 with remainder 2. Correct.

"remainder of3 when divided by5": 8/5 is1 remainder3. Correct.

"remainder of1 when divided by7":8/7 is1 remainder1. Correct.

So yes, 8 is correct. So the answer should be option A.

But wait, none of the other options is smaller than 8 except perhaps 8 itself. So 8 is the smallest positive integer that satisfies all three conditions.

Hmm, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when solving congruences, the smallest solution isn't always the first one you find, but in this case, 8 seems correct.

To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( N \) that satisfies the following conditions:

1. \( N \equiv 2 \mod 3 \)
2. \( N \equiv 3 \mod 5 \)
3. \( N \equiv 1 \mod 7 \)

### Step 1: Solve the first two congruences
From \( N \equiv 2 \mod 3 \), the possible values of \( N \) are:
\[ N = 3k + 2 \quad \text{for integer } k. \]

From \( N \equiv 3 \mod 5 \), the possible values of \( N \) are:
\[ N = 5m + 3 \quad \text{for integer } m. \]

Setting these equal to each other:
\[ 3k + 2 = 5m + 3 \implies 3k = 5m + 1. \]

Rearranging:
\[ 3k \equiv 1 \mod 5. \]

The multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 5 is 2, since \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \equiv 1 \mod 5 \). Multiplying both sides by 2:
\[ k \equiv 2 \mod 5 \implies k = 5n + 2 \quad \text{for integer } n. \]

Substituting back into \( N = 3k + 2 \):
\[ N = 3(5n + 2) + 2 = 15n + 8. \]

Thus, \( N \) can be expressed as:
\[ N = 15n + 8. \]

### Step 2: Incorporate the third congruence
We now ensure that \( N \equiv 1 \mod 7 \). Substituting \( N = 15n + 8 \) into this condition:
\[ 15n + 8 \equiv 1 \mod 7. \]

Since \( 15 \equiv 1 \mod 7 \), this simplifies to:
\[ n + 8 \equiv 1 \mod 7 \implies n \equiv -7 \mod 7 \implies n \equiv 0 \mod 7. \]

Thus, \( n = 7p \) for integer \( p \). Substituting back into \( N = 15n + 8 \):
\[ N = 15(7p) + 8 = 105p + 8. \]

The smallest positive integer occurs when \( p = 0 \), giving:
\[ N = 8. \]

### Step 3: Verify the solution
- \( 8 \div 3 = 2 \) with a remainder of 2: \( 8 \equiv 2 \mod 3 \). Correct.
- \( 8 \div 5 = 1 \) with a remainder of 3: \( 8 \equiv 3 \mod 5 \). Correct.
- \( 8 \div 7 = 1 \) with a remainder of 1: \( 8 \equiv 1 \mod 7 \). Correct.

Thus, \( N = 8 \) satisfies all the given conditions, and it is the smallest such positive integer.

### Final Answer
The correct answer is **A: 8**.
