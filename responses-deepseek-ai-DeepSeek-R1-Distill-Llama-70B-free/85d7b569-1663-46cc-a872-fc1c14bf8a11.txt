Alright, so I've got this EPR question about the benzene radical anion, but it's fully deuterated. Hmm, okay, I remember that EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) is all about the interaction between the unpaired electron and nearby nuclei, which causes hyperfine splitting. The hyperfine coupling constant tells us about this interaction.

Wait, the question is about the hyperfine value for C6D6•-. Normally, benzene is C6H6, but here all the H are replaced with D, deuterium. I think deuterium's nuclear properties are different from hydrogen, so that would affect the hyperfine splitting.

In regular benzene radical anion, C6H6•-, each hydrogen contributes to the hyperfine structure. But wait, in the benzene radical anion, the unpaired electron is in a π orbital, right? So, the hyperfine coupling is due to the protons (hydrogen nuclei) in the ring. But when the hydrogens are replaced with deuterium, which has a different nuclear spin.

I remember that the hyperfine coupling constant depends on the nuclear spin and the isotropic coupling constant. The formula I recall is A = a * (nuclear spin) * (gyromagnetic ratio of the nucleus). Or wait, maybe it's more about the ratio of the gyromagnetic ratios between the nucleus and maybe something else.

Wait, the hyperfine splitting in EPR is given by the formula A = (h * γ_e * γ_n * S · I) / (2π), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Alternatively, I think the hyperfine coupling constant for a nucleus is proportional to the nuclear g-factor and the isotropic hyperfine coupling constant, which is determined by the electron-nucleus interaction.

Deuterium has a different gyromagnetic ratio than hydrogen. The gyromagnetic ratio for a nucleus is γ_n = (μ_n)/(I), where μ_n is the nuclear magnetic moment and I is the nuclear spin. For hydrogen, γ_H is about 26.752 x 10^7 rad/(s·T), and for deuterium, γ_D is much smaller. Let me think, I think γ_D is about 4.106 x 10^7 rad/(s·T), so roughly a sixth of hydrogen's.

Since the question is about the hyperfine value, which I believe is the hyperfine coupling constant A. So, if in C6H6•- each H contributes a certain A, then in C6D6•-, each D would contribute A_d = A_h * (γ_D / γ_H). Because the hyperfine coupling scales with the gyromagnetic ratio of the nucleus.

Wait, but what's the original value for the benzene radical anion, like with H? I think in the benzene radical anion, each proton (there are six equivalent protons) contributes a hyperfine splitting. The total splitting is due to all the nuclei. So for H, each H's hyperfine coupling is about a certain value, say A. But when D is substituted, each D's A would be A multiplied by (γ_D / γ_H).

Wait, but wait another point: the nuclear spin of deuterium is I=1, while for hydrogen it's I=1/2. Does that affect the multiplicity? Because the number of lines in the EPR spectrum depends on the nuclear spin. But the question is about the hyperfine value, which is the coupling constant, not the number of lines.

So, the hyperfine coupling constant for D would be (γ_D / γ_H) times that of H. Because A is proportional to γ_n. So, for each D, A_D = A_H * (γ_D / γ_H).

What's the value for A in C6H6•-? I think the hyperfine coupling constant for each proton in benzene radical anion is about 0.375 mT. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. I recall that the proton hyperfine coupling in benzene radical anion is around 0.375 mT per proton, but perhaps I should think in terms of Gauss. Because sometimes values are given in Gauss.

Wait, 1 Tesla is 10^4 Gauss. So 1 mT is 10 Gauss. So 0.375 mT is 3.75 Gauss.

Wait, but I think the hyperfine coupling for each proton in benzene radical anion is about 2.25 G. Or maybe not. Let me think. The benzene radical anion has six equivalent protons, each with a hyperfine coupling of about 0.375 mT (which is 3.75 G). Wait, that would be pretty high, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up different molecules. The benzene radical anion's hyperfine splitting is actually small. I think the hyperfine coupling per proton is about 0.235 mT. Wait, but that's in Tesla. No, wait, let me get this straight.

In EPR, the hyperfine coupling constant A is usually given in Gauss or mT. 1 T = 10^4 Gauss, so 1 mT = 10 Gauss.

Wait, I think the hyperfine coupling for each H in benzene anion is about 0.235 mT. So when we replace H with D, each D's A would be (gamma_D / gamma_H) * 0.235 mT.

Gamma for D is about 0.4106 times that of H, because gamma_H is about 26.752e7 rad/(s*T), and gamma_D is about 10.936e7 rad/(s*T), wait no, wait let me get the exact values.

Wait, the gyromagnetic ratio for proton is γ_H = 26.752 x 10^7 rad/(s*T). For deuterium, γ_D is about 4.106 x 10^7 rad/(s*T). So the ratio γ_D/γ_H is 4.106 / 26.752 ≈ 0.1535.

So A_D = 0.235 mT * 0.1535 ≈ 0.235 * 0.1535 ≈ 0.036 mT? Wait that's about 0.36 Gauss.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me see:

Options are in various units. The options are:

A: 2.35 mT
B: 1.17 G
C: 0.117 mT
D: 0.235 G
E: 5.80 mT
F: 0.58 G
G: 3.75 G
H: 0.0235 G
I: 37.5 mT
J: 0.375 mT

We're looking for the hyperfine value for C6D6^•−.

Wait, wait, but in the benzene radical anion, the hyperfine splitting is due to all six equivalent protons. So in C6H6^•-, the total splitting would be 6 * (A_H/2), but perhaps I'm getting into the number of lines. The hyperfine coupling constant A is per nucleus, but the overall splitting is different. But the question is about the hyperfine value, so A, which is per nucleus.

Wait, but in the case of multiple equivalent nuclei, the hyperfine splitting is given by A_total = A * sqrt(N), where N is the number of equivalent nuclei. Wait, no, wait—no, that's for the linewidth or something else. Alternatively, for a nucleus with spin I, the number of lines is 2I + 1, and the spacing is A. But when you have multiple equivalent nuclei, like N equivalent nuclei each with spin I, the total number of lines is (2I + 1)^N, but the problem here is about the value of A for each nucleus.

Wait, perhaps the hyperfine coupling in C6H6^•− is about 0.235 mT per proton. So when you have six equivalent protons, the overall splitting is determined by that, but the A value per proton is 0.235 mT. So for deuterium, each D would have A = 0.235 mT * (γ_D/γ_H).

As I calculated earlier, γ_D is about 0.1535 times γ_H. So 0.235 mT * 0.1535 ≈ 0.0359 mT, which is about 0.359 Gauss. But looking at the options, I don't see that exact value, but let's check.

Wait, 0.0359 mT is 0.359 G. Looking at the options, option D is 0.235 G, which is 0.235 G. That's a bit lower than 0.359. Hmm, maybe my initial assumption about the H's A value is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the hyperfine coupling in C6H6^•− is 0.117 mT per proton? Let me think. If that's the case, then scaling that by 0.1535 gives 0.117 * 0.1535 ≈ 0.0179 mT, which is 0.179 G. There's an option H: 0.0235 G, which is much lower, and option D: 0.235 G. So perhaps my initial A_H is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the known hyperfine coupling for the benzene radical anion. From what I remember, the benzene radical anion has a hyperfine splitting of about 0.375 mT when all six protons are considered. Wait, no, that's the total splitting, but per proton it would be less.

Wait, perhaps each proton's A is 0.375 mT divided by 6, but that doesn't make sense because hyperfine splitting isn't simply additive like that. Alternatively, for six equivalent protons, each with A, the total hyperfine splitting is A*sqrt(6). Or is it A multiplied by something else?

Wait, I think when you have N equivalent nuclei, each with spin I, the hyperfine splitting can be calculated as A * sqrt(N). So for the benzene anion, with N=6, I=1/2, the total splitting would be A_H * sqrt(6). But wait, the formula I recall is that the splitting for N equivalent nuclei is A * (sqrt(N)), so the observed hyperfine splitting in the EPR spectrum is A_total = A * sqrt(N). So in the case of C6H6^•−, if the observed splitting is, say, 0.375 mT, then the per-proton A would be 0.375 / sqrt(6) ≈ 0.375 / 2.45 ≈ 0.153 mT.

Wait, but perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The hyperfine coupling constant for each proton is A. For N equivalent nuclei, the spin state can lead to a splitting that's A multiplied by the square root of N times (I+1), but I might be confusing this.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to approach this from known data. The benzene radical anion (C6H6^-) has a hyperfine coupling constant of about 0.375 mT per proton, but when you have six equivalent protons, the overall splitting is about 0.375 * sqrt(6) ≈ 0.375 * 2.45 ≈ 0.92 mT. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps I should instead think about the hyperfine splitting due to a single proton. Let me look up some example. For example, in the methyl radical (CH3), each proton has a hyperfine coupling of about 2.3 mT, but that's for three protons, and the splitting would be a triplet with each line spaced by 2.3 mT. Wait, no, in that case, the splitting for each proton is about 2.3 mT, and with three equivalent protons, the splitting would be more complicated. But perhaps that's a different scenario.

Alternatively, in the benzene radical anion, the hyperfine splitting comes from six equivalent protons. So the EPR spectrum would show a septet (since 6 * (1/2) spin → but wait, each proton has spin 1/2, so the total spin state would be a multiplet with 6 + 1 =7 lines? No, that's for nuclei with integer spin, but for spin 1/2 nuclei, it's a bit different.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the wrong approach. Let me try to think differently. The hyperfine coupling constant for a deuterium nucleus in this case would be (γ_D / γ_H) times that of hydrogen. So if the H's A is X, then D's A is X*(γ_D/γ_H).

Assuming that for C6H6^•−, each H's A is 0.235 mT (as in option J, perhaps?), then D's A would be 0.235 * (4.106 / 26.752) ≈ 0.235 * 0.1535 ≈ 0.036 mT, which is 0.36 G. Looking at the options, the closest would be option D: 0.235 G, but that's higher than 0.36 G. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial A_H value.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the hyperfine coupling constant for each proton in C6H6^•− is actually 0.117 mT. Then scaling gives 0.117 * 0.1535 ≈ 0.018 mT, which is 0.18 G. But none of the options match that exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the correct A_H is 0.375 mT, making A_D = 0.375 * 0.1535 ≈ 0.0576 mT or 0.576 G. Looking at the options, F is 0.58 G. That's close.

Wait, option F is 0.58 G, which is 0.058 mT. Wait, no, 0.58 G is 0.058 mT. Wait, no, because 1 mT is 10 G, so 0.58 G is 0.058 mT. So if A_D is approximately 0.0576 mT (from 0.375 mT * 0.1535), that would be about 0.58 G (since 0.0576 mT = 0.576 G). Hmm, but that would round to approximately 0.58 G, which is option F.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me double-check the math. γ_D is 4.106, γ_H is 26.752. 4.106 / 26.752 = approximately 0.1535. So if A_H is 0.375 mT, then A_D would be 0.375 * 0.1535 = 0.0576 mT, which is 0.576 G. So the closest option is F: 0.58 G.

But wait, looking at the options, option J is 0.375 mT, which would be 3.75 G. So if the question is about the hyperfine value for each D, it's 0.576 G. But the options don't have 0.576 G. F is 0.58 G, which is very close. So perhaps the correct answer is F.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the hyperfine coupling for the benzene anion is 0.235 mT per H, leading to D's A being 0.235 * 0.1535 ≈ 0.036 mT, which is 0.36 G. The closest option would be D: 0.235 G, but that's way higher.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the hyperfine coupling for each D is (1/6) of the total splitting observed for H6. So if the total splitting for H6 is, say, 2.35 mT, then each H contributes 2.35 / sqrt(6) ≈ 0.96 mT. Then D would contribute 0.96 * (gamma_D / gamma_H) ≈ 0.96 * 0.1535 ≈ 0.147 mT, which is 1.47 G. But that's not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the hyperfine coupling for each H is 0.117 mT, so for D it's 0.018 mT (0.18 G). But the options don't have that.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of another approach. The hyperfine coupling constant is inversely proportional to the mass of the isotope because the hyperfine splitting is smaller for heavier isotopes. Wait, no, that's for something else. Wait, no, it's the vibrational energy that depends on mass, not hyperfine coupling.

Wait, another thought: deuterium has a lower gyromagnetic ratio than hydrogen, so the hyperfine splitting would be smaller. So if the original hyperfine splitting for H is a certain value, the D would have a smaller value, scaled by the ratio of the gyromagnetic ratios.

In the case of benzene radical anion, each H contributes a hyperfine coupling of A. So for D, each would contribute A * (γ_D/γ_H).

So, if the original A for H is, say, 0.235 mT, then D's A is 0.235 * (4.106/26.752) ≈ 0.235 * 0.1535 ≈ 0.036 mT, which is 0.36 G. Looking at the options, the closest is option D: 0.235 G, but that's higher. Alternatively, option H is 0.0235 G, which is much lower.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the original A for H. Let me see. I think the benzene radical anion's hyperfine splitting is about 0.375 mT when considering all six protons. So for each proton, the A would be that divided by sqrt(6), as the total splitting is A*sqrt(N), where N is the number of equivalent nuclei. So A per H would be 0.375 / sqrt(6) ≈ 0.375 / 2.449 ≈ 0.153 mT.

Then, for D, A would be 0.153 mT * (γ_D/γ_H) ≈ 0.153 * 0.1535 ≈ 0.0235 mT, which is 0.235 G. Wait, 0.0235 mT is 0.235 G, which is option D.

Wait, that makes sense. So if the hyperfine splitting from six H's is 0.375 mT, then each H contributes A = 0.375 / sqrt(6) ≈ 0.153 mT. Then each D would contribute A_D = 0.153 * (4.106/26.752)
