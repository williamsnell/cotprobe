B: Fractional reserve banking permits banks to keep a varying reserve ratio depending on the size of the deposit.
C: Fractional reserve banking is when banks are required to keep 100% of their deposits in cash.

F: Fractional reserve banking is a system where banks are required to keep only a fraction of their deposits in liquid form and can invest the remainder in government bonds only.
G: Fractional reserve banking means that banks keep less than 100% of their deposits in cash, placing the rest in income-earning investments.
H: Fractional reserve banking allows banks to lend out exactly 50% of their deposits and requires them to hold the other 50% in reserve.
I: Fractional reserve banking mandates that banks hold a fixed reserve of 20% of their deposits and are free to use the rest without restrictions.

Okay, so I've got this question about fractional reserve banking. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through. I remember that fractional reserve banking has something to do with how banks manage their deposits and reserves. Let me see.

From what I recall, banks don't keep all the money that people deposit with them as cash in the vault. Instead, they lend out a portion of it. The idea is that not everyone will want to withdraw all their money at the same time. So the bank keeps a fraction, or a reserve, and lends out the rest. That way, they can earn interest on the loans, which is how they make money.

Looking at the options, I'll go through them one by one.

Option A says they keep a fraction in gold reserves. Wait, I think reserves are usually cash or central bank money, not necessarily gold. Plus, modern banking doesn't typically use gold reserves in that way, so I'm not sure about A.

Option B mentions varying reserve ratios based on deposit size. I think the reserve requirement can vary, but is that the definition of fractional reserve banking? Maybe, but I'm not certain. I'll keep it in mind but check others.

Option C says banks keep 100% in cash. No, that's the opposite. Fractional reserve means they don't keep all deposits as reserves, so C is wrong.

Option D says all deposits are kept in cash. Again, that's not right because fractional reserve implies they keep less than all.

Option E claims they lend out all deposits. That can't be right because if they lent everything, they'd have no reserves, which would be risky. So E is incorrect.

Option F says they keep a fraction in liquid form and invest the rest in government bonds only. Hmm, I think the rest can be invested in various things, not just government bonds. So F might be too restrictive.

Option G states that banks keep less than 100% in cash and put the rest in income-earning investments. That sounds right. They keep a fraction (reserve) and invest or lend the rest to earn money. So G looks like a strong candidate.

Option H says they lend exactly 50% and hold 50%. I don't think it's a fixed 50-50 split. The reserve ratio can vary, so H is probably wrong.

Option I says they must hold 20% and can use the rest without restrictions. This might be a specific reserve requirement, but fractional reserve banking isn't about a fixed 20%. It's more general, so I is not the definition.

Option J claims banks can issue loans equal to deposits without any reserves. That sounds like a 0% reserve, which is not fractional. Fractional means a part, not none, so J is incorrect.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be G. It correctly describes that banks keep less than 100% in cash and invest the rest.

Fractional reserve banking is a system in which banks keep less than 100% of their deposits in cash, using the remainder for income-earning investments such as loans. This allows banks to generate revenue through interest while maintaining enough liquidity to meet typical withdrawal demands. Among the options provided, the one that accurately captures this definition is:

**G: Fractional reserve banking means that banks keep less than 100% of their deposits in cash, placing the rest in income-earning investments.**

Answer: G
