Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an airplane's groundspeed. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when an airplane is flying, its speed relative to the ground isn't just its airspeed because wind can affect it. So the question is about finding the groundspeed when there's a crosswind.

Alright, the problem says the airplane's nose is pointing north, and its airspeed is 40 km/h. There's a crosswind blowing at 30 km/h, and it's at right angles. Wait, right angles to what? Oh right, right angles to the airplane's direction. So the crosswind is perpendicular to the airplane's intended path.

Wait, so the airplane is heading north with an airspeed of 40 km/h. But there's a crosswind from, say, the east or west, blowing at 30 km/h. That means the wind is pushing the plane sideways as it moves forward. So the plane's actual path over the ground isn't straight north anymore. Instead, it's a combination of its airspeed and the wind's speed.

So to find the groundspeed, which is the airplane's speed relative to the ground, I think we need to consider the vector addition of the airplane's airspeed and the wind speed. But wait, airspeed is the plane's speed through the air, and the wind is moving the air itself. So the groundspeed would be the vector sum of the airspeed and the wind's velocity.

Wait no, actually, I think it's the other way around. The groundspeed is the result of the airplane's velocity relative to the air plus the wind's velocity relative to the ground. So if the plane is pointing north, but there's a crosswind from the west at 30 km/h, then the plane's ground velocity would be the combination of its northward component and the westward wind component.

So since both velocities are perpendicular, we can model this with a right triangle, where the airplane's airspeed is one leg (north), and the wind's speed is the other leg (west). The groundspeed would be the hypotenuse of this triangle.

Let me visualize this. The plane is moving north at 40 km/h, but the wind is pushing it west at 30 km/h. So the resultant velocity vector is the combination of these two. So the groundspeed is the magnitude of this resultant vector.

So using the Pythagorean theorem, the groundspeed (let's call it G) would be the square root of (40^2 + 30^2). Let me calculate that.

40 squared is 1600, and 30 squared is 900. Adding them gives 2500. The square root of 2500 is 50. So the groundspeed should be 50 km/h.

Wait, but wait a second. Does the crosswind affect the groundspeed like that? Because sometimes I get confused whether it's the wind's speed or the component of wind that's in the direction of motion. Oh, right, because the problem states it's a crosswind at right angles, so the entire wind speed is perpendicular. So the plane's airspeed is entirely in one direction (north), and the wind is entirely perpendicular (say, west). So yes, the two are perpendicular, so their vectors are at right angles. Hence, adding them as perpendicular components.

So the ground speed would be the square root of (40² +30²) =50 km/h.

Looking at the options, option C is 50 km/h. So the answer should be C.

To determine the groundspeed of the airplane, we need to account for both its airspeed and the crosswind. The airplane is heading north with an airspeed of 40 km/h, while a crosswind is blowing at 30 km/h at right angles (perpendicular) to the airplane's direction. 

The groundspeed is the resultant velocity vector of the airplane's airspeed and the wind's velocity. Since the two velocities are perpendicular, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the groundspeed:

\[
\text{Groundspeed} = \sqrt{(\text{Airspeed})^2 + (\text{Wind Speed})^2}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{Groundspeed} = \sqrt{40^2 + 30^2} = \sqrt{1600 + 900} = \sqrt{2500} = 50 \, \text{km/h}.
\]

Thus, the groundspeed of the airplane is 50 km/h. Among the provided options, the correct answer is:

C: 50 km/h.
