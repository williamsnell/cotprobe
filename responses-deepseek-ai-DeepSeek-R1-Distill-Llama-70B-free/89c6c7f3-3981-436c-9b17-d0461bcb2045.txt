Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about the digestive system and which organs secrete digestive enzymes. The question is asking which one does not secrete enzymes. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the digestive system has several organs, each with specific functions. The main ones are the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, liver, pancreas, and gallbladder.

The question gives four options: mouth (A), stomach (B), gall bladder (C), and small intestine (D). I need to determine which of these does not secrete digestive enzymes.

Starting with the mouth. Oh right, the mouth has salivary glands that produce saliva. And in saliva, there's an enzyme called amylase, which breaks down carbohydrates into simpler sugars. So the mouth does secrete enzymes. So option A is not the correct answer.

Next, the stomach. I know the stomach lining secretes several enzymes. One major one is pepsin, which helps break down proteins. So the stomach definitely secretes enzymes. So option B is out.

Now the small intestine. I recall that the small intestine's walls have enzymes, but I think most of the enzymatic action here comes from enzymes secreted by the pancreas into the small intestine. However, the small intestine itself also produces some enzymes, like lactase, sucrase, and maltase, which break down sugars. So yes, the small intestine does secrete enzymes. So option D isn't the right answer.

That leaves the gallbladder. The gallbladder's main role is to store bile that's produced by the liver. Bile contains bile salts which help emulsify fats, making them easier to digest. But does the gallbladder itself produce enzymes? Wait, I think the liver makes bile, which includes bile salts, but not enzymes. The enzymes in the digestive system come from places like the mouth, stomach, pancreas, and small intestine. So the gallbladder doesn't secrete enzymes; it just stores and releases bile. 

So the correct answer should be option C, the gall bladder.

The question asks which organ in the digestive system does not secrete digestive enzymes. Here's the analysis of each option:

- **Mouth (A):** The mouth secretes saliva containing the enzyme amylase, which breaks down carbohydrates. Therefore, it does secrete enzymes.  
- **Stomach (B):** The stomach secretes enzymes like pepsin, which breaks down proteins. Thus, it also secretes enzymes.  
- **Small Intestine (D):** The small intestine secretes enzymes such as lactase, sucrase, and maltase, which break down sugars. Hence, it secretes enzymes.  
- **Gallbladder (C):** The gallbladder stores bile produced by the liver but does not secrete digestive enzymes itself. Bile contains bile salts for fat emulsification, not enzymes.

The organ that does not secrete digestive enzymes is the **gallbladder**.

Answer: C
