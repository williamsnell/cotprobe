Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what it's about. Hmm, it's about a body moving in the positive x direction. The body passes the origin at time t=0. Between t=0 and t=1 second, it has a constant speed of 24 m/s. Then, at t=1 second, it's given a constant acceleration of 6 m/s² in the negative x direction. The question is asking for the position x at t=11 seconds. The options are from A to J.

Alright, let's break this down. I think I need to consider the motion in two parts: the first second (from t=0 to t=1), and then from t=1 to t=11, which is 10 seconds.

First part: from t=0 to t=1. Since the speed is constant at 24 m/s, the position at t=1 can be found using the equation of motion. Oh wait, constant speed means no acceleration, so it's just moving at a steady velocity. The position after 1 second would be x = v * t. So x = 24 m/s * 1 s = 24 meters. So at t=1, the body is at x=24 m.

Now, the second part: from t=1 to t=11, which is 10 seconds. But wait, the acceleration starts at t=1. The acceleration is given as 6 m/s² in the negative x direction. So acceleration a is -6 m/s².

I think I should calculate the position at t=11 using the initial conditions at t=1 as the starting point. Let's denote the initial velocity at t=1 as u. Since the speed was 24 m/s until t=1, and it's moving in the positive x, u = 24 m/s.

So from t=1 to t=11, which is 10 seconds, the body is under constant acceleration. The position can be found using the equation:

x = u*t + (1/2)*a*t²

Wait, but wait. Oh, right, because at t=1, the position is 24 m, so when considering the displacement from t=1, the position at t=11 would be x = x1 + (u*t + 0.5*a*t²). Or perhaps it's better to compute the position from t=0 to t=11, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, since the acceleration starts at t=1, maybe I should compute the position from t=1 onwards.

Let me think. The time between t=1 and t=11 is 10 seconds, so t=10 s for this phase.

So, initial velocity u = 24 m/s, acceleration a = -6 m/s², time t=10 s.

I can use the equation x = ut + 0.5*a*t².

Plugging in the values:

x = (24 m/s)(10 s) + 0.5*(-6 m/s²)(10 s)^2.

Calculate each term:

First term: 24 *10 = 240 m.

Second term: 0.5*(-6) = -3. Then, (10)^2=100, so -3 * 100 = -300 m.

So x = 240 -300 = -60 m.

Wait, but wait. That's the displacement from t=1 to t=11. So the position at t=11 is the position at t=1 plus this displacement. At t=1, position was 24 m, so adding:

24 m + (-60 m) = -36 m.

Hm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake. Because when acceleration is applied, the velocity might change, and perhaps the body comes to a stop and starts moving backward. Let me check that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the velocity at t=11 first and see if the body is moving backward.

The velocity as a function of time when acceleration is present is v = u + a*t.

So u=24, a=-6, t=10.

v=24 + (-6)*10 = 24 -60 = -36 m/s. So at t=11, the velocity is -36 m/s, meaning it's moving in the negative x direction.

Wait, but maybe I should calculate the time when the body comes to rest. Because if the body is decelerating, at some point it might stop and then start moving backward.

So the time taken to reach zero velocity from u=24, a=-6:

v=0 = 24 + (-6)*t.

So 0 = 24 -6t → 6t=24 → t=4 seconds. So at t=1+4=5 seconds, the body comes to rest. Then, after that, it starts moving in the negative x direction.

So the motion from t=1 to t=5 is deceleration until stop, then from t=5 to t=11, it's accelerating in the negative direction.

Wait, but maybe my initial approach didn't account for that. Because when I calculated the displacement from t=1 to t=11, I assumed that the acceleration was applied for the entire 10 seconds, but perhaps that's correct because the acceleration is constant, so the equation of motion would automatically account for the change in direction.

Alternatively, maybe I should split the motion into two parts: from t=1 to t=5 (4 seconds), and then t=5 to t=11 (6 seconds).

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to just calculate the displacement using the equation I used earlier. Let me see.

Wait, when I calculated x = 24*10 + 0.5*(-6)*10², that gave me x = 24*10=240, 0.5*(-6)*100= -300, so total displacement from t=1 to t=11 is 240 -300= -60 m. Then, adding the initial 24 m gives 24 + (-60) = -36 m. So x at t=11 would be -36 m. Looking at the options, option B is -36m, and option G is -60. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in how I'm applying the equations. Maybe I should use the general equation for position as a function of time, considering the acceleration starts at t=1.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think of the total time as 11 seconds, and model the motion in two phases.

So from t=0 to t=1: constant velocity, v=24 m/s.

From t=1 to t=11: constant acceleration a=-6 m/s², initial velocity u=24 m/s.

So the position at time t is:

x(t) = x_0 + v_0 * t if t ≤1.

But for t>1, x(t) = x(1) + u*(t-1) + 0.5*a*(t-1)^2.

So x(1) =24 m, u=24, a=-6.

So for t=11,

x(11) =24 + 24*(10) + 0.5*(-6)*(10)^2.

Which is 24 + 240 + (-300) = 24 + (240-300) = 24 -60 = -36 m.

So that's option B: -36m.

Wait, but let me think again. Another approach: calculate the position at any time t>1.

Alternatively, maybe using the equation x(t) = x(1) + v_1*(t-1) + 0.5 a (t-1)^2.

Which is the same approach as before.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the average velocity during the acceleration phase.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The initial approach gave me x= -36 m, which is option B. But wait, I should make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

Wait, let me re-calculate the displacement from t=1 to t=11:

u=24, a=-6, t=10.

x = u*t + 0.5*a*t².

So 24*10=240.

0.5*(-6)*10^2= 0.5*(-6)*100= (-3)*100= -300.

So 240-300= -60.

Then, add the initial position at t=1, which is 24 m. So 24 + (-60) = -36 m.

Yes, that's correct. So the position at t=11 is -36 m, which is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the position using another method, such as finding the time when the body changes direction and then computing the displacement in each phase.

As I thought earlier, the body comes to rest at t=5 seconds (t=1 +4 s). Then from t=5 to t=11, it's moving in the negative direction.

So from t=1 to t=5 (4 seconds), the displacement is:

x1 = u*t + 0.5*a*t².

u=24, a=-6, t=4.

x1 =24*4 + 0.5*(-6)*(4)^2.

24*4=96.

0.5*(-6)*16= (-3)*16= -48.

So x1=96-48=48 m.

So from t=1 to t=5, the body moves 48 m in the positive direction, so position at t=5 is 24 +48=72 m.

Then, from t=5 to t=11, which is 6 seconds, the body is moving with initial velocity v=0 (since it stopped at t=5), and acceleration a=-6 m/s².

So the displacement in this phase, x2, is:

x2 = u*t + 0.5*a*t^2.

But u=0, because at t=5, velocity is zero.

So x2 =0*6 + 0.5*(-6)*(6)^2.

Which is 0 + 0.5*(-6)*36 = (-3)*36= -108 m.

So the total displacement from t=1 to t=11 is x1 +x2=48 + (-108)= -60 m.

Adding to the initial position at t=1 (24 m), the position at t=11 is 24 + (-60)= -36 m.

So same result as before. So the answer should be B: -36m.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option B is -36m, which is what I got. So I think that's the correct answer.

To determine the position \( x \) of the body at \( t = 11 \) seconds, we analyze the motion in two phases:

### Phase 1: \( t = 0 \) to \( t = 1 \) second
The body moves with a constant velocity of \( v = 24 \, \text{m/s} \) in the positive \( x \)-direction. The position at \( t = 1 \) is:
\[
x(1) = v \cdot t = 24 \cdot 1 = 24 \, \text{m}.
\]

### Phase 2: \( t = 1 \) to \( t = 11 \) seconds
At \( t = 1 \), the body is subjected to a constant acceleration \( a = -6 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) in the negative \( x \)-direction. The motion during this phase can be analyzed using the kinematic equation:
\[
x(t) = x(1) + u \cdot (t - 1) + \frac{1}{2} a \cdot (t - 1)^2,
\]
where \( u = 24 \, \text{m/s} \) is the initial velocity at \( t = 1 \), and \( t - 1 = 10 \, \text{s} \) is the time interval for this phase.

Substituting the values:
\[
x(11) = 24 + (24 \cdot 10) + \frac{1}{2} (-6) \cdot (10)^2,
\]
\[
x(11) = 24 + 240 - 300 = -36 \, \text{m}.
\]

Thus, the position of the body at \( t = 11 \) seconds is \( x = -36 \, \text{m} \).

### Final Answer
The correct option is **B: -36m**.
