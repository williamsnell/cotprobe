Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the last three digits of 2003 raised to the power of 2002^2001. That sounds really complicated, but I remember that when dealing with the last few digits of a number, modular arithmetic is the way to go. Specifically, since we're looking for the last three digits, we should compute the result modulo 1000.

First, I think I should simplify 2003 modulo 1000. Let's see, 2003 divided by 1000 is 2 with a remainder of 3. So 2003 mod 1000 is 3. That means 2003^(anything) mod 1000 is the same as 3^(that same exponent) mod 1000. So the problem reduces to finding 3^(2002^2001) mod 1000.

Now, exponentiating such a huge exponent directly is impossible, but maybe Euler's theorem can help here. Euler's theorem says that if two numbers are coprime, then a^φ(n) ≡ 1 mod n, where φ is Euler's totient function. Since 3 and 1000 are coprime (their GCD is 1), this should apply.

So I need to find φ(1000). Let me calculate that. 1000 is 2^3 * 5^3. φ(n) for n = p1^k1 * p2^k2 * ... is n*(1-1/p1)*(1-1/p2)*..., so φ(1000) = 1000 * (1-1/2) * (1-1/5) = 1000 * 1/2 * 4/5 = 1000 * 2/5 = 400. So φ(1000) is 400.

That means 3^400 ≡ 1 mod 1000. So if I can express the exponent 2002^2001 as a multiple of 400 plus some remainder, then I can simplify the exponent.

So the exponent is 2002^2001. Let's compute this exponent modulo φ(1000)=400. So we need to find 2002^2001 mod 400.

Wait, but 2002 mod 400 is 2002 - 5*400 = 2002-2000=2. So 2002 mod 400 is 2. So 2002^2001 mod 400 is 2^2001 mod 400.

Now, 2^2001 mod 400. Hmm. Let's see. 400 is 16 * 25, so perhaps I can compute modulo 16 and modulo 25 separately and use the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to compute 2^2001 mod 400 directly, or find a pattern.

Wait, 2^4 is 16, and 2^5 is 32, but let's think about higher exponents.

I recall that for modulus 2^k, Euler's theorem can be applied, but since 2 is a prime factor of 400, which is 2^4 *5^2, maybe it's better to compute 2^2001 mod 16 and mod 25, then combine.

Wait, 400 = 16 * 25, and since 16 and 25 are coprime, using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) would help.

So let's compute 2^2001 mod 16 and mod 25.

Starting with mod 16: 2^4 = 16 ≡ 0 mod 16. So any higher power of 2 beyond 4 will also be 0 mod 16. Since 2001 is much larger than 4, 2^2001 mod 16 is 0.

Next, mod 25: Let's compute 2^2001 mod 25. Since 2 and 25 are coprime, Euler's theorem applies. φ(25) is 20 because 25 is 5^2, so φ(5^2)=5^2 -5=20. So 2^20 ≡1 mod25.

So 2001 divided by 20 is 100 with a remainder of 1 (since 20*100=2000, 2001-2000=1). So 2^2001 mod25 is (2^20)^100 * 2^1 mod25. Since 2^20 mod25 is 1, this becomes 1^100 *2 = 2 mod25.

So now, we have:

2^2001 ≡ 0 mod16

2^2001 ≡ 2 mod25

We need to find a number x such that x ≡0 mod16 and x≡2 mod25.

Let x = 16k. Then, substitute into the second equation: 16k ≡2 mod25.

So 16k ≡2 mod25. Let me solve for k.

16k ≡2 mod25

Multiply both sides by the modular inverse of 16 mod25. The inverse of 16 mod25 is a number m such that 16m ≡1 mod25.

Let me find m. Let's try:

16*11=176 → 176 mod25 is 176-7*25=176-175=1. So the inverse is 11.

So multiply both sides by 11:

k ≡ 2*11 mod25 → 22 mod25.

So k=22 +25t for some integer t.

So x=16k=16*(22+25t) = 352 + 400t.

Thus, the smallest positive solution mod400 is 352.

So 2^2001 mod400 is 352.

So the exponent 2002^2001 mod400 is 352. Therefore, 3^(2002^2001) mod1000 is 3^352 mod1000.

Now, we need to compute 3^352 mod1000.

Hmm, computing 3^352 directly is tough, but we can break it down using exponentiation by squaring or looking for patterns.

Alternatively, maybe using Euler's theorem again. Wait, φ(1000)=400, but 352 is less than 400, so perhaps we can compute it more cleverly.

Alternatively, compute 3^352 mod8 and mod125, then use CRT to find mod1000.

Wait, because 1000=8*125, and 8 and 125 are coprime.

Compute 3^352 mod8:

3 mod8 is 3.

3^1 mod8=3

3^2=9 mod8=1

3^3=3^2 *3 → 1*3=3 mod8

3^4=3^2 *3^2 →1*1=1 mod8

So the pattern repeats every 2 exponents. 352 is even, so 3^352 mod8=1.

Next, compute 3^352 mod125.

Since 3 and 125 are coprime, Euler's theorem applies. φ(125)=100, so 3^100 ≡1 mod125.

352 divided by 100 is 3 with remainder 52. So 3^352 = (3^100)^3 *3^52.

So that's 1^3 *3^52 mod125 = 3^52 mod125.

Now, compute 3^52 mod125.

Hmm, perhaps compute this using exponentiation by squaring.

3^1=3

3^2=9

3^4=81

3^8=(81)^2=6561. 6561 mod125: Let me compute 125*52=6500. 6561-6500=61 → 61 mod125 is 61.

3^8 mod125=61.

3^16=(3^8)^2=61^2=3721. 3721 mod125: 125*29=3625. 3721-3625=96 → 96 mod125=96.

3^16 mod125=96.

3^32= (3^16)^2=96^2=9216. 9216 mod125: Let's see, 125*73=9125. 9216-9125=91. So 3^32 mod125=91.

Now, 3^52 = 3^(32 +16 + 4) = 3^32 *3^16 *3^4.

So 91 *96 *81 mod125.

Compute step by step.

First, multiply 91 and 96.

91 *96 = let's compute that: 90*96=8640, 1*96=96 → 8640+96=8736.

8736 mod125: Let's divide 8736 by 125.

125*69=8625. 8736-8625=111. So 8736 mod125 is 111.

So 91*96 mod125 is 111.

Next, multiply by 81.

111 *81 = (100+11)*81=100*81 +11*81=8100+891=8991.

8991 mod125: 125*71=8875. 8991-8875=116 →116 mod125=116.

So 3^52 mod125 is 116.

So putting it all together: 3^352 mod125 is 116.

Now, we have:

3^352 ≡1 mod8

3^352 ≡116 mod125

We need to find x ≡1 mod8 and x ≡116 mod125.

Let me solve this using CRT.

Let x =125k +116. We need this to satisfy x ≡1 mod8.

Compute 125k +116 mod8.

125 mod8: 125 /8 is 15*8=120, 125-120=5 → 5 mod8.

116 mod8: 116 /8=14*8=112 → 116-112=4 →4 mod8.

So 5k +4 ≡1 mod8.

So 5k ≡-3 mod8 → 5k ≡5 mod8.

Multiply both sides by inverse of 5 mod8. The inverse of 5 mod8 is 5, since 5*5=25≡1 mod8.

So k ≡5*5 mod8 →25 mod8=1 →k≡1 mod8.

So k=8m +1 for some integer m.

Therefore, x=125*(8m +1) +116 = 1000m +125 +116= 1000m +241.

So mod1000, x is 241.

Therefore, 3^352 mod1000 is 241.

So the last three digits of 2003^(2002^2001) are 241.
</think>

To find the last three digits of \(2003^{(2002^{2001})}\), we compute \(2003^{(2002^{2001})} \mod 1000\). 

1. **Simplify the base modulo 1000**:  
   Since \(2003 \mod 1000 = 3\), the problem reduces to finding \(3^{(2002^{2001})} \mod 1000\).

2. **Apply Euler's theorem**:  
   Euler's theorem states that if \(a\) and \(n\) are coprime, then \(a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \mod n\), where \(\phi(n)\) is Euler's totient function. For \(n = 1000 = 2^3 \cdot 5^3\),  
   \[
   \phi(1000) = 1000 \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{5}\right) = 400.
   \]  
   Thus, \(3^{400} \equiv 1 \mod 1000\). We need to compute the exponent \(2002^{2001} \mod 400\).

3. **Simplify the exponent modulo 400**:  
   First, \(2002 \mod 400 = 2\), so \(2002^{2001} \mod 400 = 2^{2001} \mod 400\).  
   Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), compute \(2^{2001} \mod 16\) and \(2^{2001} \mod 25\):  
   - \(2^{2001} \mod 16 = 0\) (since \(2^4 = 16\)).  
   - For \(2^{2001} \mod 25\), \(\phi(25) = 20\), so \(2^{2001} = 2^{20 \cdot 100 + 1} = (2^{20})^{100} \cdot 2^1 \equiv 1^{100} \cdot 2 \equiv 2 \mod 25\).  

   Using CRT, solve \(x \equiv 0 \mod 16\) and \(x \equiv 2 \mod 25\). Let \(x = 16k\). Then \(16k \equiv 2 \mod 25\). The modular inverse of 16 modulo 25 is 11, so \(k \equiv 2 \cdot 11 \equiv 22 \mod 25\). Thus, \(x = 16 \cdot 22 = 352\). Therefore, \(2^{2001} \mod 400 = 352\).

4. **Compute \(3^{352} \mod 1000\)**:  
   Using CRT, compute \(3^{352} \mod 8\) and \(3^{352} \mod 125\):  
   - \(3^{352} \mod 8 = 1\) (since \(3^2 = 9 \equiv 1 \mod 8\)).  
   - For \(3^{352} \mod 125\), \(\phi(125) = 100\), so \(3^{352} = 3^{100 \cdot 3 + 52} = (3^{100})^3 \cdot 3^{52} \equiv 1^3 \cdot 3^{52} \mod 125\).  
     Compute \(3^{52} \mod 125\) using exponentiation by squaring:  
     \[
     3^1 = 3, \quad 3^2 = 9, \quad 3^4 = 81, \quad 3^8 = 6561 \equiv 61 \mod 125,
     \]
     \[
     3^{16} = 61^2 = 3721 \equiv 96 \mod 125, \quad 3^{32} = 96^2 = 9216 \equiv 91 \mod 125.
     \]
     Thus, \(3^{52} = 3^{32} \cdot 3^{16} \cdot 3^4 \equiv 91 \cdot 96 \cdot 81 \mod 125\).  
     Compute step-by-step:  
     \[
     91 \cdot 96 = 8736 \equiv 111 \mod 125, \quad 111 \cdot 81 = 8991 \equiv 116 \mod 125.
     \]
     Therefore, \(3^{352} \mod 125 = 116\).

   Using CRT, solve \(x \equiv 1 \mod 8\) and \(x \equiv 116 \mod 125\). Let \(x = 125k + 116\). Then \(125k + 116 \equiv 1 \mod 8\). Since \(125 \equiv 5 \mod 8\) and \(116 \equiv 4 \mod 8\),  
   \[
   5k + 4 \equiv 1 \mod 8 \implies 5k \equiv -3 \equiv 5 \mod 8.
   \]
   The modular inverse of 5 modulo 8 is 5, so \(k \equiv 5 \cdot 5 \equiv 1 \mod 8\). Thus, \(k = 8m + 1\) for some integer \(m\), and  
   \[
   x = 125(8m + 1) + 116 = 1000m + 241.
   \]
   Therefore, \(3^{352} \mod 1000 = 241\).

The last three digits of \(2003^{(2002^{2001})}\) are **241**.
