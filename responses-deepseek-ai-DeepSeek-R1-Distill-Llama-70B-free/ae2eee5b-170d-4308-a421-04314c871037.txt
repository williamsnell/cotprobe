Question:

A department store distributes its overhead based on the direct labor cost. If the overhead for one month was $4,200, and the direct labor cost of the department store was $35,000, find (a) what per-cent overhead is of direct labor and (b) the cost of overhead for thehousewaresdepartment, which has a labor cost of $5,340.

Options:

A: 14%, $747.60

Okay, so I have this problem about department store overhead distribution. Hmm, let me read it again. The store distributes its overhead based on direct labor cost. The total overhead for the month was $4,200, and the direct labor cost was $35,000. I need to find two things: part (a) the percentage that overhead is of direct labor, and part (b) the cost of overhead for the housewares department which has a labor cost of $5,340.

Alright, starting with part (a). So overhead is a percentage of direct labor. The formula for that would be (Overhead / Direct Labor) * 100 to get the percentage. So plugging in the numbers, $4,200 divided by $35,000. Let me calculate that. 4200 divided by 35000. Let's see, 35000 goes into 4200 about 0.12 times, because 0.1 times 35000 is 3500, and 0.12 times 35000 is 4200 exactly. Oh, so that's 12%. So part (a) is 12%.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. 35,000 times 0.12 is 4,200. Yep, that's correct. So the overhead is 12% of direct labor.

Now part (b): finding the overhead cost for the housewares department. They have a labor cost of $5,340. Assuming that the overhead is applied at the same rate across all departments, I can use the 12% rate. So 12% of 5,340. Let me calculate that. 5,340 times 0.12. Hmm, 5,000 times 0.12 is 600, and 340 times 0.12 is 40.8. So 600 +40.8 is 640.8. So $640.80.

Wait, looking at the options, option G is 12% and $640.80. So that must be the correct answer.

Let me check the options again to make sure. Option G says 12%, $640.80. Yep, that's what I got. So the correct answer should be option G.

The problem involves calculating the percentage of overhead relative to direct labor and determining the overhead cost for a specific department. 

(a) To find the percentage of overhead relative to direct labor, the formula used is:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Overhead}}{\text{Direct Labor}} \right) \times 100
\]

Given Overhead = $4,200 and Direct Labor = $35,000:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4,200}{35,000} \right) \times 100 = 12\%
\]

(b) To find the overhead cost for the housewares department, which has a labor cost of $5,340, the same overhead rate of 12% is applied:

\[
\text{Overhead Cost} = 0.12 \times 5,340 = 640.80
\]

Thus, the percentage is 12%, and the overhead cost for the housewares department is $640.80. The correct answer is:

G: 12%, $640.80

Answer: G
