Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating the change in chemical potential of a perfect gas when its pressure is increased isothermally. Hmm, I remember that chemical potential for gases is related to pressure changes. Let me think about what I learned in thermodynamics.

The chemical potential μ of a gas is given by μ = μ° + RT ln(P), where P is the pressure and μ° is the standard chemical potential at 1 atm. Oh wait, but wait, the formula might actually be μ = μ° + RT ln(P/P°), since P° is the standard pressure. Right, because when P = P°, the term becomes ln(1) which is zero, so μ equals μ°.

The problem says the pressure increases from 1.8 atm to 29.5 atm, and the temperature is 40 degrees Celsius. Oh wait, but the question says all data refer to 298.15 K unless stated otherwise. Oh, so maybe the temperature is 298.15 K, not 40°C? Wait, 40°C is 313.15 K, but the question says unless stated otherwise. The problem says the change occurs at 40°C, so I should use that temperature.

But wait, no, wait. The question says that data refer to 298.15 K unless otherwise stated. Oh, but the process here is happening at 40°C, which is different. So the temperature for this process is 40°C, which is 313.15 K.

So the change in chemical potential Δμ is equal to the change as the pressure changes. Since the process is isothermal, the change in μ is given by Δμ = RT ln(P2/P1), because for an ideal gas, at constant T, the change in chemical potential is RT ln(P2/P1).

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. The chemical potential is μ = μ° + RT ln(P). So if pressure changes from P1 to P2 at constant T, then the change in μ is μ2 - μ1 = RT ln(P2/P1). So yes, Δμ = RT ln(P2/P1).

So plugging the numbers in: R is 8.314 J/mol·K, T is 313.15 K. P1 is 1.8 atm, P2 is 29.5 atm.

Wait, but wait, since the ratio is P2/P1, which is 29.5 / 1.8. Let me calculate that. 29.5 divided by 1.8 is about... Let's see, 1.8 times 16 is 28.8, so 29.5 is 16.388... So P2/P1 is approximately 16.388.

Wait, no, wait, 1.8 * 16 = 28.8, which is less than 29.5. 29.5 -28.8 is 0.7. 0.7/1.8 is approximately 0.388. So P2/P1 is 16.388.

So ln(16.388) is approximately... Let me think about ln values. I know ln(10) is about 2.3026, ln(20) is about 2.9957, ln(15) is about 2.708. Hmm, 16 is e^2.77, because e^2 is about 7.389, e^3 is 20.085. So 16 is between e^2.7 and e^2.8. Let me calculate it more precisely.

Alternatively, use the fact that ln(16) is ln(2^4) = 4 ln(2) ≈4 *0.6931 = 2.7724. But 16.388 is a bit more than 16, so maybe around 2.797.

Wait, maybe I should use a calculator approach. Let me think: 16.388 is 16 * (1 + 0.388/16) = 16*(1+0.02425) = approximately, so ln(16.388) = ln(16) + ln(1.02425).

ln(16) is 2.77258. ln(1.02425) is approximately 0.024. So total is about 2.77258 + 0.024 = 2.7966.

So ln(P2/P1) is approximately 2.7966.

Now, RT is 8.314 J/mol·K * 313.15 K. Let me compute that.

8.314 * 313.15. Let me calculate 8 * 313.15 is 2505.2, 0.314 * 313.15: 0.3 *313.15=93.945, 0.014*313.15≈4.384. So 93.945 +4.384=98.329. So total RT is 2505.2 +98.329≈2603.529 J/mol.

So RT is about 2603.5 J/mol. Multiply by ln(P2/P1) which is 2.7966.

So 2603.5 * 2.7966. Let's compute that.

Approximate 2600 *2.8 is 7280, 2600 *0.7966 is about 2600*0.7=1820, 2600*0.0966≈251. So total is 7280 + 1820 + 251 = 8351? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, wait, wait, no: 2603.5 * 2.7966 = ?

Let me compute 2603.5 * 2 = 5207.

2603.5 * 0.7966 is about: Let's break it down.

0.7 * 2603.5 = 1822.45.

0.09 *2603.5 = 234.315.

0.0066 *2603.5 ≈17.163.

So adding those: 1822.45 + 234.315 = 2056.765 +17.163=2073.928.

So total RT ln(P2/P1) is 5207 +2073.928 = 7280.928 J/mol.

Convert that to kJ: 7280.928 J is 7.280928 kJ. Since the change is from lower pressure to higher, the chemical potential increases, so it's positive.

Looking at the options, option B is +7.3 kJ/mol^-1, which is very close to 7.28. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but wait, wait. Did I make any mistake in the calculation? Let me double-check.

RT at 313.15 K: 8.314 *313.15. Let me compute more accurately.

8.314 *300=2494.2, 8.314 *13.15= ? Let's compute 8 *13.15=105.2, 0.314 *13.15= approx 4.1231. So 105.2 +4.1231=109.3231. So total RT is 2494.2 +109.3231 = 2603.523 J/mol.

Right, so that part is correct.

ln(29.5/1.8) is ln(16.388). I approximated it as 2.7966. Let me check with a calculator. Well, e^2.7966 is e^2.79 is about 16.3, which matches 16.388. So that's correct.

So 2603.5 J *2.7966 = 7280 J, which is 7.28 kJ. So the answer should be B, which is +7.3 kJ/mol^-1.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem states that all data refer to 298.15 K unless stated otherwise. Wait, but the process is happening at 40°C, which is 313.15 K. So the temperature is different. So I think using 313 K is correct.

But wait, another thought: the formula for chemical potential is Δμ = nRT ln(P2/P1), but wait, since it's per mole, n is 1, so it's RT ln(P2/P1).

Yes, correct.

Wait, but another thing: when pressure increases, the chemical potential increases, so the change is positive. So the answer is positive, which all the options are.

So I think the correct answer is B, +7.3 kJ/mol^-1.

To calculate the change in chemical potential (Δμ) of a perfect gas when its pressure is increased isothermally from 1.8 atm to 29.5 atm at 40°C, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta \mu = RT \ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)
\]

Here:
- \( R = 8.314 \, \mathrm{J \, mol^{-1} \, K^{-1}} \) (ideal gas constant),
- \( T = 40^\circ \mathrm{C} = 313.15 \, \mathrm{K} \),
- \( P_1 = 1.8 \, \mathrm{atm} \),
- \( P_2 = 29.5 \, \mathrm{atm} \).

### Step 1: Calculate the pressure ratio
\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{29.5}{1.8} \approx 16.388
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the natural logarithm of the pressure ratio
\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right) = \ln(16.388) \approx 2.7966
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( RT \)
\[
RT = 8.314 \times 313.15 \approx 2603.5 \, \mathrm{J \, mol^{-1}}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( \Delta \mu \)
\[
\Delta \mu = RT \ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right) = 2603.5 \times 2.7966 \approx 7280.9 \, \mathrm{J \, mol^{-1}}
\]
Convert to kilojoules:
\[
\Delta \mu \approx 7.28 \, \mathrm{kJ \, mol^{-1}}
\]

### Step 5: Match with the closest option
The closest option to \( +7.28 \, \mathrm{kJ \, mol^{-1}} \) is **B: +7.3 kJ mol\(^{-1}\)**.
