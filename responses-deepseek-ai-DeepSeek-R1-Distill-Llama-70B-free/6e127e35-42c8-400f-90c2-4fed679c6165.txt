Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the heat needed to raise the temperature of lead (Pb) from 20°C to 360°C. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when dealing with phase changes, you have to consider both the heat required to change the temperature of each phase and the heat for the phase change itself.

First, I need to break down the process into steps. The initial temperature is 20°C, and the final is 360°C. The melting point of lead is given as 327°C, so I know that between 20°C and 327°C, the lead is solid. Then from 327°C to 360°C, it's liquid. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait—when you heat something, you go from solid to liquid at the melting point. So, wait, when heating lead, you first heat the solid up to its melting point, then melt it, and then heat the liquid further. So I think that's the case here.

So the steps are:
1. Heating the solid Pb from 20°C to 327°C.
2. Melting the solid Pb at 327°C to liquid Pb.
3. Heating the liquid Pb from 327°C to 360°C.

Each of these steps requires calculating the heat involved.

Let me note down the given values:
- Mass of Pb: 60 grams.
- Specific heat of solid Pb (c_solid): 0.0306 cal/g°C.
- Specific heat of liquid Pb (c_liquid): 0.0375 cal/g°C.
- Heat of fusion (Hf): 5.86 cal/g.
- Melting point: 327°C.

Now, for each step:

1. Heating the solid:
The formula for heat is Q = m * c * ΔT.
ΔT is the change in temperature. So from 20 to 327°C is a change of (327 - 20) = 307°C.
So Q1 = 60 g * 0.0306 cal/g°C * 307°C.

Let me calculate that. 60 times 0.0306 is... 60 * 0.03 is 1.8, and 60*0.0006 is 0.036. So 1.8 + 0.036 = 1.836. Then multiply by 307. Hmm, 1.836 * 300 is 550.8, and 1.836 *7 is about 12.852. So total Q1 is 550.8 +12.852 = 563.652 cal. Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the options don't have that high a value for the first step. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. 60 * 0.0306 = 1.836. Then 1.836 * 307. Let me compute 307 * 1.836. Well, 300 * 1.836=550.8, 7*1.836=12.852. So 550.8 +12.852=563.652 cal. Yeah, that's correct.

2. Melting the solid:
Q2 is the heat of fusion. Q2 = m * Hf. So 60g * 5.86 cal/g. 60 *5 is 300, 60 *0.86 is 51.6, so 300+51.6=351.6 cal.

3. Heating the liquid:
Now, the temperature change is from 327°C to 360°C, which is 33°C. So Q3 = m * c_liquid * ΔT. So 60g * 0.0375 cal/g°C *33°C.

Calculating that: 60 * 0.0375 = 2.25. Then 2.25 *33. Let's see, 2 *33=66, 0.25*33=8.25. So 66+8.25=74.25 cal.

Now, sum all the Qs: Q1 + Q2 + Q3 = 563.652 + 351.6 +74.25.

Adding them up:

563.652 + 351.6 = 915.252. Then adding 74.25 gives 915.252 +74.25 = 989.502 cal, approximately 990 cal.

Looking at the options, option A is 990 cal. So the answer should be A.

To determine the heat needed to raise 60 g of Pb from 20°C to 360°C, we break the process into three steps:

1. **Heating the solid Pb from 20°C to 327°C**:  
   The formula for heat is \( Q = m \cdot c \cdot \Delta T \).  
   - \( m = 60 \, \text{g} \), \( c_{\text{solid}} = 0.0306 \, \text{cal/g°C} \), \( \Delta T = 327 - 20 = 307 \, \text{°C} \).  
   - \( Q_1 = 60 \cdot 0.0306 \cdot 307 = 563.652 \, \text{cal} \).

2. **Melting the solid Pb at 327°C**:  
   The heat of fusion is \( Q = m \cdot H_f \).  
   - \( m = 60 \, \text{g} \), \( H_f = 5.86 \, \text{cal/g} \).  
   - \( Q_2 = 60 \cdot 5.86 = 351.6 \, \text{cal} \).

3. **Heating the liquid Pb from 327°C to 360°C**:  
   Again, \( Q = m \cdot c \cdot \Delta T \).  
   - \( m = 60 \, \text{g} \), \( c_{\text{liquid}} = 0.0375 \, \text{cal/g°C} \), \( \Delta T = 360 - 327 = 33 \, \text{°C} \).  
   - \( Q_3 = 60 \cdot 0.0375 \cdot 33 = 74.25 \, \text{cal} \).

Finally, summing all the heat contributions:  
\[
Q_{\text{total}} = Q_1 + Q_2 + Q_3 = 563.652 + 351.6 + 74.25 = 989.502 \, \text{cal} \approx 990 \, \text{cal}.
\]

From the given options, the closest value is **990 cal**, which corresponds to **option A**.
