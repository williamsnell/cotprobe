Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about enthalpy changes and standard enthalpies of formation. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about finding the standard enthalpy of formation for NaHCO3(s). The reaction given is 2NaHCO3(s) → Na2CO3(s) + CO2(g) + H2O(l), and the ΔH is 30.92 Kcal/mole. Then there are the standard enthalpies of formation for Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O.

Wait, standard enthalpy of formation is the change when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So I remember that for elements, the ΔHf° is zero. Like, for Na(s), H2(g), C(graphite), O2(g), their ΔHf° is zero.

The given reaction is the decomposition of NaHCO3 into Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. The ΔH is positive, 30.92 Kcal/mole, which makes sense because it's an endothermic reaction when you break something down, maybe requiring heat.

So I think I need to write the formation reactions for each substance involved and then relate them to the given reaction.

Let me list what I know:

The standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) are:
- Na2CO3(s): -270.3 Kcal/mol
- CO2(g): -94.0 Kcal/mol
- H2O(l): -68.4 Kcal/mol

And the reaction given is:
2 NaHCO3(s) → Na2CO3(s) + CO2(g) + H2O(l)     ΔH = +30.92 Kcal/mol

I need to find ΔHf° for NaHCO3(s).

I remember that the enthalpy change of a reaction can be calculated using the standard enthalpies of formation of the products minus reactants. So, ΔH°reaction = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants).

But wait, in this case, the reaction given is the reverse of the formation reaction of NaHCO3. So I need to manipulate the equation to get the formation of 2 moles of NaHCO3.

Let me write the formation reaction for NaHCO3. The formation reaction would be:
Na(s) + H2O(l) + CO2(g) → NaHCO3(s)

Wait, no, wait. The standard formation is from elements. So sodium bicarbonate is NaHCO3. Its formation would involve sodium (Na), hydrogen (H2), carbon (C), and oxygen (O2) in their standard states.

So the correct formation reaction for NaHCO3 should be:

Na(s) + H2(g) + C(s) + 3/2 O2(g) → NaHCO3(s)

But perhaps there's another way to approach this. Let's think about the given reaction and how to relate it to the standard enthalpies.

The given reaction is 2 NaHCO3 → Na2CO3 + CO2 + H2O, ΔH = 30.92 Kcal/mol.

I can write this as:
2 NaHCO3(s) → Na2CO3(s) + CO2(g) + H2O(l)

The ΔH for this reaction is given as +30.92 Kcal. So according to the formula, ΔH° = [sum of products' ΔHf°] - [sum of reactants' ΔHf°].

So, ΔH° = [ΔHf°(Na2CO3) + ΔHf°(CO2) + ΔHf°(H2O)] - [2 * ΔHf°(NaHCO3)].

Because the reactants are 2 moles of NaHCO3, which is 2 times its ΔHf°.

I can plug in the values I have:

30.92 = [ (-270.3) + (-94.0) + (-68.4) ] - [2 * (ΔHf° NaHCO3) ]

Wait, let me compute the sum in the products first.

Sum of products:
Na2CO3: -270.3
CO2: -94.0
H2O: -68.4
Total: (-270.3) + (-94.0) + (-68.4) = let's calculate:

-270.3 -94 is -364.3, then -68.4 makes it -432.7 Kcal/mol.

So,

30.92 = (-432.7) - 2ΔHf_NaHCO3.

Wait, let's rearrange the equation:

2ΔHf_NaHCO3 = (-432.7) - 30.92

Because:

30.92 = (-432.7) - 2ΔHf → so 2ΔHf = (-432.7) - 30.92 → 2ΔHf = -463.62 → ΔHf = -463.62 / 2 = -231.81 Kcal/mol.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see -231.81. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in signs.

Wait, let me double-check the equation setup.

The reaction is 2 NaHCO3 → Na2CO3 + CO2 + H2O, ΔH is +30.92.

So according to ΔH° = sum products - sum reactants.

So, [ΔHf Na2CO3 + ΔHf CO2 + ΔHf H2O] - [2 * ΔHf NaHCO3] = ΔH° reaction.

So,

(-270.3) + (-94.0) + (-68.4) - 2x = 30.92.

Wait, no, because the reaction is 2 NaHCO3 → products, so the left side (reactants) is 2 moles of NaHCO3, each with ΔHf x.

So:

[sum products] - [sum reactants] = ΔH° reaction.

Which is:

[ (-270.3) + (-94.0) + (-68.4) ] - [ 2x ] = 30.92.

So, (-432.7) - 2x = 30.92 → -2x = 30.92 + 432.7 → 463.62 → x = -463.62 / 2 → x = -231.81.

Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see this. The options are all multiples like 185, 220, 270, etc. Wait, perhaps I have a sign error.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Because the reaction is written as 2 NaHCO3 → Na2CO3 + CO2 + H2O, which is the same as the decomposition of NaHCO3 into these products.

So the standard enthalpy change for this reaction is +30.92 Kcal/mol. So the reaction is endothermic, meaning that the products have higher enthalpy than the reactants.

Wait, but when I'm calculating, let me ensure I'm using the correct signs.

So the equation is:

ΔH°_rxn = [sum ΔHf° (products)] - [sum ΔHf° (reactants)]

Here, the products are Na2CO3, CO2, H2O. The reactant is NaHCO3.

So:

ΔH°_rxn = [ΔHf°(Na2CO3) + ΔHf°(CO2) + ΔHf°(H2O)] - [2 * ΔHf°(NaHCO3) ]

We know ΔH°_rxn is +30.92.

So plugging in the numbers:

30.92 = [ (-270.3) + (-94.0) + (-68.4) ] - [2x ]

So 30.92 = (-432.7) - 2x → 2x = (-432.7) - 30.92 → 2x = (-463.62) → x = (-463.62)/2 → x = -231.81 Kcal/mol.

Wait, but this isn't matching any of the options. Let me look at the options again.

Options are A: -185, B: -440, C: -94, D: -360.2, E: -270.3, F: -305.6, G: -150, H: -325.4, I: -100, J: -220.

Hmm. None of them is -231.8. So perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup.

Wait, perhaps the reaction should be written in reverse. Because the given reaction is the decomposition of NaHCO3 into Na2CO3, etc. So maybe I should consider the reverse reaction for calculating the formation.

Wait, no. The formation reaction of NaHCO3 would be from its elements, but the given reaction is its decomposition, so I think the approach I took is correct.

Wait, maybe I didn't account for the fact that NaHCO3 is a reactant, so when it's on the reactant side, its ΔHf is subtracted.

Wait no, the formula is [sum products] - [sum reactants].

In this reaction, NaHCO3 is the reactant, so it's on the reactant side, so 2x would be part of the sum for reactants.

Wait, let me double-check the equation.

The reaction is 2 NaHCO3 → Na2CO3 + CO2 + H2O.

So the products are Na2CO3, CO2, H2O.

The reactants are 2 moles of NaHCO3.

So:

ΔH°_rxn = [sum ΔHf°(products)] - [sum ΔHf°(reactants)]

Which is:

[ΔHf Na2CO3 + ΔHf CO2 + ΔHf H2O] - [2 * ΔHf NaHCO3] = ΔH°_rxn.

So 30.92 = [ (-270.3) + (-94.0) + (-68.4) ] - (2x).

Wait, that's correct.

Let me calculate the sum of products:

-270.3 -94.0 = -364.3; -364.3 -68.4 = -432.7.

So,

30.92 = (-432.7) - 2x → 

So 30.92 + 432.7 = -2x → 

463.62 = -2x → x = -463.62 / 2 → x = -231.81.

Hmm, but none of the options match. So maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction should be written as the formation of NaHCO3. That is, the reverse reaction.

Because the given reaction is the decomposition. So if I reverse the reaction, it would be:

Na2CO3(s) + CO2(g) + H2O(l) → 2 NaHCO3(s), ΔH = -30.92 Kcal/mol.

Then, for this reversed reaction, the ΔH would be negative.

So, for this reversed reaction, the equation would be:

ΔH° = [2x] - [sum of products → which are Na2CO3, CO2, H2O.]

Wait, no, wait. Let me write it correctly.

The reversed reaction is:

Na2CO3(s) + CO2(g) + H2O(l) → 2 NaHCO3(s), ΔH = -30.92.

So the sum of the products is 2x (for 2 moles NaHCO3), and the sum of reactants is [ΔHf Na2CO3 + ΔHf CO2 + ΔHf H2O].

So:

ΔH° = [2x] - [ (-270.3) + (-94.0) + (-68.4) ] = -30.92.

Because the ΔH for this reversed reaction is negative.

So,

2x - (-432.7) = -30.92 → 

2x + 432.7 = -30.92 → 

2x = -30.92 - 432.7 → 

2x = -463.62 → x = -231.81 Kcal/mol.

Same result as before. So no, that's not matching any of the options. Hmm. So perhaps I've made a wrong assumption.

Wait, let me check the given ΔH values again.

Wait, the question says: ΔH = 30.92 Kcal/mole for the reaction 2NaHCO3 → Na2CO3 + CO2 + H2O.

So the ΔH is positive because the reaction is endothermic.

Wait another approach: Maybe I should calculate the ΔHf for NaHCO3 using the given reaction and the known ΔHf values.

Wait, perhaps I should write the formation reactions for all the substances involved.

The standard enthalpy of formation of a compound is the enthalpy change when one mole of the compound is formed from its elements in their standard states.

So for NaHCO3(s), the formation reaction would be:

Na(s) + H2O(l) + CO2(g) → NaHCO3(s)

Wait, no, because H2O and CO2 aren't elements. The elements are Na(s), H2(g), C(graphite), O2(g).

So the correct formation reaction should be:

Na(s) + H2(g) + C(s) + 3/2 O2(g) → NaHCO3(s)

Similarly, for Na2CO3(s), the formation reaction is 2Na(s) + C(s) + 3/2 O2(g) → Na2CO3(s)

But perhaps it's better to think in terms of using Hess's Law, using the given reaction and the known ΔHf values.

Let me outline the steps:

We can think of the given reaction as:

2 NaHCO3(s) → Na2CO3(s) + CO2(g) + H2O(l)     ΔH = 30.92 Kcal.

We need to find the ΔHf° of NaHCO3(s). Let's denote it as x.

We can write the ΔHf° for each substance:

ΔHf°(Na2CO3) = -270.3 → because it's formed from elements.

ΔHf°(CO2) = -94.0.

ΔHf°(H2O) = -68.4.

ΔHf°(NaHCO3) = x.

So, for the given reaction, the enthalpy change is:

ΔH° = [ΔHf(Na2CO3) + ΔHf(CO2) + ΔHf(H2O)] - [2 * ΔHf(NaHCO3)].

So,

30.92 = (-270.3) + (-94.0) + (-68.4) - 2x.

Let me compute the sum:

-270.3 -94 = -364.3; -364.3 -68.4 = -432.7.

So,

30.92 = (-432.7) - 2x → 

Adding 432.7 to both sides:

30.92 + 432.7 = -2x → 

463.62 = -2x → 

x = -463.62 / 2 → x = -231.81 Kcal/mol.

Hmm, this is the same result as before, but it's not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, looking at the options again, perhaps the correct answer is not there, but that can't be. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should have considered the reverse reaction. Because the given reaction is the decomposition of NaHCO3 into Na2CO3 and other products. So perhaps I should write the formation reaction in terms of that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the question is correct, and I'm just not seeing the right option. Wait, maybe I misread the options. Let me check again.

The options are:

A: -185.0

B: -440.0

C: -94.0

D: -360.2

E: -270.3

F: -305.6

G: -150.0

H: -325.4

I: -100.0

J: -220.0

Hmm, none of these is -231. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, maybe the ΔH is in the reverse direction. Let me see: the given reaction is 2NaHCO3 → Na2CO3 + CO2 + H2O, ΔH = +30.92.

But when I used this, I got x = -231.8, which isn't an option. So perhaps I should have used the reverse reaction, which would be Na2CO3 + CO2 + H2O → 2 NaHCO3, with ΔH = -30.92.

So, using that, the ΔH would be:

ΔH° = [2x] - [sum products → Na2CO3, CO2, H2O]

Which would be:

-30.92 = 2x - [ (-270.3) + (-94.0) + (-68.4) ]

So → 2x = (-30.92) + (-270.3 -94.0 -68.4 )

Wait, sum inside the brackets is (-270.3 -94.0 -68.4) = (-432.7).

So,

2x = (-30.92) + (-432.7) = -463.62 → x = -463.62 / 2 = -231.81.

Same result again. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign of the ΔH. Let me check.

The reaction is 2NaHCO3 → Na2CO3 + CO2 + H2O, ΔH = +30.92.

This means that the products have higher enthalpy than the reactants. So the sum of products' ΔHf° is higher than that of reactants.

But when I calculated, [sum products] is -432.7, and 2x is sum of reactants' ΔHf°.

So, 30.92 = (-432.7) - 2x → So 2x = (-432.7) -30.92 = -463.62 → x= -231.81.

Wait, but if the options don't have this, perhaps the problem is that the ΔH given is not the standard enthalpy change, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I confused the products and reactants in the equation.

Let me try writing the equation again.

The reaction as given is:

2 NaHCO3 →
