Question:

What is wrong in the following array declaration? int my _ array (200);

Options:

A: The datatype for the array elements is not specified
B: The array is not initialized
C: The array size is too large

Okay, so I've got this programming question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out what's wrong with the given array declaration. Let's see, the code is written as int my _ array (200);. Hmm, I remember that in C++, when you declare an array, you usually specify the size inside square brackets. 

Wait, the code has my _ array (200). Oh wait, wait, the underscore is in the middle. Oh right, in C++, variable names can't have spaces, so maybe that's a typo. But wait, the array syntax is wrong too. Because normally you'd write int myArray[200]; or something like that. The square brackets are missing here. So the array size is specified with parentheses instead of square brackets. That's probably the issue.

Looking at the options, let's go through them. Option A says the datatype isn't specified, but int is there, so that's not it. Option B says it's not initialized, but the question is about the declaration, not initialization. Option C says the size is too large, but 200 is a reasonable size. Option D says a semicolon is missing, but the code ends with a semicolon, I think. Wait, wait, the code as given is int my _ array (200); — does that have a semicolon? Oh wait, in the question, the code is written as "int my _ array (200);" so I think it does end with a semicolon. So D is not the issue.

Option E is about the size being a constant expression. Well, 200 is a constant, so that's fine. Option F says the size must be after the variable name. Well, in the correct syntax, the size is in square brackets right after the name, like myArray[200]. So the placement is correct in that sense, but the syntax is wrong because it's using parentheses instead of brackets. So F isn't the issue because the size is after the name, but the problem is the brackets.

Option G says the number of subscripts isn't enclosed in square brackets. Oh right, that's exactly the problem. The array declaration should have the size in square brackets, not parentheses. So the correct syntax is int myArray[200];. So the error is that the size isn't in square brackets, making option G correct.

Wait, but looking again, the variable name is my _ array — that's probably a typo. Because variable names can't have spaces. So the underscore is in the wrong place. But wait, in the code, it's written as my _ array, which would be a syntax error because of the space. So maybe that's another issue. But the question is about array declaration. So perhaps the main issue is the square brackets.

Wait, but in C++, variable names can't have spaces, so having my _ array is actually two separate identifiers: my_, array. Oh wait, no, because there's a space between _ and array. So that's an error. But the question is about the array declaration. So perhaps that's another mistake, but the primary issue for the array is the square brackets.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The code is int my _ array (200);. So the compiler would read it as declaring variables my_, array, etc., but I don't think that's correct. Wait, no, because the syntax is wrong. The correct way is int myArray[200];. So the code as written has multiple errors. 

But looking at the options, option G is about the subscripts not being in square brackets. So that's definitely a problem because the parentheses are used instead. So that's the main issue. So the answer should be G.

Another thought: the variable name with a space is also an error. But looking at the options, none of them mention invalid variable names. So the question is probably focusing on the array syntax. So the answer is G.

The array declaration `int my _ array (200);` has multiple issues, but the primary problem is the incorrect syntax for specifying the array size. In C++, the size of an array must be enclosed in square brackets, not parentheses. The correct syntax should be `int myArray[200];`. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: The datatype is specified as `int`, so this is incorrect.  
- **B**: The array is not initialized, but the question focuses on declaration, not initialization.  
- **C**: The size `200` is reasonable and not too large.  
- **D**: A semicolon is present at the end of the declaration.  
- **E**: The size `200` is a valid constant expression.  
- **F**: The size is correctly placed after the variable name.  
- **G**: The number of subscripts (array size) is not enclosed in square brackets, which is the correct issue.

Thus, the main error is that the array size is not enclosed in square brackets, making **G** the correct answer.
