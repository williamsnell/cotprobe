Okay, so I've got this question about the formal sources of international law. Hmm, I remember that the sources are listed in Article 38 of the ICJ Statute. Let me think... The question is asking about their relationship, like which one takes precedence over the others.

The options are A through J. The formal sources are treaties, custom, general principles of law, and judicial decisions and teachings as subsidiary sources. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question is about the formal sources, which are treaties, custom, and general principles. Judicial decisions and teachings are not formal sources; they're subsidiary means.

So the main sources are treaties, custom, and general principles. Now, the question is about their hierarchy. From what I've studied, there's no clear hierarchy established in international law. Like, it's not like domestic law where statutes might take precedence over case law. Instead, each source has its own role, and sometimes they can be complementary. 

I think some sources might say that treaties can't create obligations for third states without their consent, but that's about treaties, not hierarchy. Custom is considered more general and widespread. But in practice, when there's a conflict, it's not always clear which one prevails. For example, a treaty might codify customary law, but if there's a conflict, maybe the treaty would take precedence for the parties to it.

Wait, but the question is about the formal sources' relationship. So the answer might be that there's no hierarchy. Let me look at the options:

Option J says there's no hierarchy between the formal sources. That sounds right. Because each source is considered primary depending on the context. Like, sometimes treaties are more specific, so they might be applied, but custom is more general. So the ICJ would look at what's applicable without a strict hierarchy.

Other options suggest one source supersedes another. Like option A says treaties supersede custom. But I don't think that's universally true. It depends on the situation. 

So the correct answer is J: There is no hierarchy between the formal sources of international law.

The formal sources of international law, as outlined in Article 38 of the ICJ Statute, include treaties, custom, and general principles of law. Judicial decisions and teachings are considered subsidiary means, not formal sources. The question asks about the relationship between these formal sources.

International law does not establish a strict hierarchy among treaties, custom, and general principles. Each source plays a distinct role, and their application can depend on the specific context. Treaties may prevail in specific cases for the parties involved, while custom provides broader, generalized rules. General principles offer foundational guidance. The absence of a fixed hierarchy means that no single source universally supersedes the others.

Analyzing the options, Option J correctly reflects this understanding: "There is no hierarchy between the formal sources of international law."

Answer: J
