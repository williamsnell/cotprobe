Okay, so I've got this problem here about a college graduate who took out a $100,000 loan to buy a condo. The interest rate is 9% per annum. The payments they're making are increasing over time, starting at $800 and increasing by t/120 each month, where t is the number of months since the loan started. The question is, when will the loan be fully paid off?

Hmm, let me think. I remember that loans like this are usually amortized, meaning each payment covers the interest for the period and part of the principal. But in this case, the payments are increasing each month. So it's not a standard fixed-payment loan. I need to model how each payment affects the remaining balance.

Wait, the payment each month is 800*(1 + t/120). So the first payment at t=0 is $800, then next is 800*(1 + 1/120) which is like 800*1.008333... So it's increasing each month by a factor. Interesting.

I think I need to model the outstanding balance each month, applying the interest and then subtracting the payment. But since the payment increases each month, this might get a bit tricky. Maybe I can set up an equation that sums up the present value of all the payments to equal the loan amount.

Right, because each payment has a present value, and the sum of those present values should equal the initial loan amount. So the present value formula for each payment would be P_t / (1 + r)^t, where r is the monthly interest rate.

Wait, the annual interest rate is 9%, so the monthly rate is 9% / 12 = 0.75% per month, or 0.0075. So r = 0.0075.

Each payment is 800*(1 + t/120), made at month t. So the present value of each payment is 800*(1 + t/120) / (1.0075)^t. The sum of this from t=0 to t=N should equal 100,000.

So the equation is: sum_{t=0}^{N} [800*(1 + t/120)] / (1.0075)^t = 100,000.

Hmm, solving this sum for N. That seems complicated. I'm not sure how to compute this sum without a calculator or some mathematical tools. Maybe there's a formula for such a series.

Wait, perhaps I can split the sum into two parts. Let's see: 800/120 * sum(t) / (1.0075)^t + 800 * sum(1/(1.0075)^t). The second sum is a geometric series, which I can compute. The first sum is the sum of t/(1+r)^t from t=0 to N. I think there's a formula for that.

The formula for the sum from t=0 to infinity of t x^t is x/(1-x)^2, but that's for |x| <1. Wait, but in this case, each term is t/(1.0075)^t. Let me think, maybe the sum from t=0 to N of t/(1.0075)^t can be found in terms of a closed-form expression.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as an annuity with increasing payments. I've heard of something called a "graduated payment mortgage" where payments increase over time. Maybe there's a standard formula for the present value of such payments.

Wait, let me try to structure this. The present value PV is the sum from t=0 to N of PMT_t / (1 + r)^t, where PMT_t is the payment at time t.

In this case, PMT_t = 800*(1 + t/120). So:

PV = sum_{t=0}^N [800*(1 + t/120)] / (1.0075)^t.

Let me factor out the 800:

PV = 800 * sum_{t=0}^N (1 + t/120) / (1.0075)^t.

This can be split into two sums:

PV = 800 * [ sum_{t=0}^N 1/(1.0075)^t + (1/120) sum_{t=0}^N t/(1.0075)^t ].

So it's 800 times [S1 + (1/120) S2], where S1 is the sum of 1/(1.0075)^t from t=0 to N, and S2 is the sum of t/(1.0075)^t from t=0 to N.

I know that S1 is a geometric series. The sum from t=0 to N of 1/(1.0075)^t is [1 - (1/(1.0075))^{N+1}]/(1 - 1/(1.0075)) ) = [1 - (1/1.0075)^{N+1}]/(0.0075/1.0075) ) = [1 - (1/1.0075)^{N+1}] * (1.0075/0.0075).

Wait, let me calculate that denominator correctly. 1/(1.0075) is the same as (1.0075)^-1, so 1 - (1.0075)^-1 = (1.0075 - 1)/1.0075 = 0.0075 / 1.0075 ≈ 0.007464.

So S1 = [1 - (1/1.0075)^{N+1}] / (0.007464).

Wait, maybe I should compute S1 as [1 - (1/(1.0075))^{N+1}]/( (1.0075 - 1)/1.0075 ) ), which simplifies to [1 - (1/(1.0075))^{N+1}] * (1.0075 / 0.0075).

So S1 = (1.0075 / 0.0075) * [1 - (1/1.0075)^{N+1}].

Similarly, S2 is sum_{t=0}^N t/(1.0075)^t.

I recall that the sum from t=0 to infinity of t x^t is x/(1 - x)^2, but here x is 1/1.0075. However, since we're summing up to N, not infinity, it's a finite sum. The formula for finite sum S2 is [ (1/(1.0075)) (1 - (1/(1.0075))^{N} (1 + N(1.0075)) ) ] / (1 - 1/(1.0075))^2.

Wait, let me double-check that. The finite sum S2 is:

sum_{t=0}^N t x^t = x(1 - (N+1) x^N + N x^{N+1}) ) / (1 - x)^2.

Wait, maybe I should look it up, but since I can't, I'll try to derive it.

Let me consider S = sum_{t=0}^N t x^t.

I know that sum_{t=0}^N x^t = (1 - x^{N+1}) ) / (1 - x).

Now, take the derivative of both sides with respect to x:

dS/dx = sum_{t=0}^N t x^{t-1} = [ (0 - (N+1) x^N ) (1 - x) - (1 - x^{N+1} ) (-1) ) ] / (1 - x)^2.

Multiplying both sides by x:

sum t x^t = x [ ( - (N+1) x^N (1 - x) + (1 - x^{N+1}) ) ] / (1 - x)^2.

Let me expand that numerator:

- (N+1) x^N (1 - x) + (1 - x^{N+1} )

= - (N+1)x^N + (N+1)x^{N+1} + 1 - x^{N+1}

= 1 - (N+1)x^N + ( (N+1) - 1 ) x^{N+1}.

= 1 - (N+1) x^N + N x^{N+1}.

So putting it all together, sum t x^t = x [1 - (N+1)x^N + N x^{N+1} ] / (1 - x)^2.

In our case, x is 1/1.0075. Let me compute x:

x = 1/1.0075 ≈ 0.99256.

So S2 is:

x * [1 - (N+1) x^N + N x^{N+1} ] / (1 - x)^2.

Now, let's plug x into the equation. Since 1 - x = 1 - 0.99256 = 0.00744, so (1 - x)^2 ≈ (0.00744)^2 ≈ 0.0000554.

But perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

Wait, 1/1.0075 is exactly 0.992563143. So 1 - x = 0.007436857. Squared, that's (0.007436857)^2 ≈ 0.000055347.

Now, going back to the S2 expression:

S2 = x * [1 - (N+1) x^N + N x^{N+1} ] / ( (1 - x)^2 )

= (0.992563143) * [1 - (N+1) x^N + N x^{N+1} ] / (0.000055347).

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I can compute this for a few values of N and see when the present value equals 100,000.

Alternatively, perhaps I can try trial and error using the options given.

The options are:

A:160, B:145.5, C:180, D:150, E:120, F:190, G:135.36, H:200, I:125, J:110.

Wait, that's a lot of options. Let me see which one is around when the present value equals 100,000.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make an approximation.

Wait, the payment starts at $800 and increases by t/120 each month. So each month, the payment increases by 1/120, which is approximately 0.8333%. So the payments are growing at a rate of 0.8333% per month, which is 10% per year (since 0.8333% *12 ≈10%).

Wait, that's a significant growth rate. The loan is at 9% annual interest, so each year the payments are growing faster than the interest rate. So the loan should be paid off in less than, say, 20 years (240 months), but looking at the options, the highest is 200 months, which is about 16.67 years.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the initial payments. The first payment is $800, which probably doesn't cover the interest for the first month.

Wait, the monthly interest is 9% /12 = 0.75% on $100,000, which is $750. So the first payment is $800, which is $50 more than the interest. So the principal reduces by $50 that month.

The next payment is 800 * (1 + 1/120) ≈ 800 * 1.008333 ≈ $806.6667. The interest for the second month is 0.75% of the new principal, which is $99,950. So 0.75% of 99,950 is approximately $749.625. So the principal reduces by about 806.6667 - 749.625 = $57.04.

So each month, the principal is being paid down, but the payment is increasing each month.

Hmm, but doing this for each month until the principal hits zero would take a long time. Maybe I can write a small table for the first few months to see the trend.

But perhaps a better approach is to use the present value formula I was thinking earlier and try to compute it for each option to see which N makes the sum equal to 100,000.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make an educated guess based on the options.

Wait, let me think about the present value components. The first sum S1 is a standard annuity, and S2 is the sum involving t.

Let me compute S1 and S2 for a few N values.

Wait, but without a calculator, this is tough. Maybe I can assume that the correct answer is around 160 to 180 months.

Wait, another approach: since the payments are increasing each month, the total amount paid each month is higher, so the loan should be paid off faster than a standard 30-year mortgage. Wait, but 30 years is 360 months, which isn't an option here. The options only go up to 200 months, which is about 16.7 years.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the average payment. The initial payment is $800, and each month it increases by t/120. So the payment at month t is 800*(1 + t/120). The average payment over N months would be roughly 800*(1 + (N-1)/240), perhaps? Wait, maybe the average is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the total sum of payments is approximately the average payment multiplied by the number of months. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the present value of the payments is $100,000. So if I can estimate the total sum of payments, I can get an idea. But since each payment is increasing, the future payments are higher, but their present value is discounted.

Alternatively, let me think about the total number of payments. If the payments were fixed at $800, the loan would take much longer, but since they're increasing, it should be shorter.

Wait, but how much shorter? Let me try to compute using the present value formula for a fixed payment to get an idea.

If the payment was fixed at $800, then the present value would be 800 * [1 - (1/(1.0075))^N ] / 0.0075. Setting that equal to 100,000:

100,000 = 800 * [1 - (1/1.0075)^N ] / 0.0075.

Let me compute the right side:

Divide 100,000 by 800: 100,000 /800 = 125.

Multiply by 0.0075: 125 * 0.0075 = 0.9375.

So 1 - (1/1.0075)^N = 0.9375.

Thus, (1/1.0075)^N = 1 - 0.9375 = 0.0625.

Take natural log: ln( (1/1.0075)^N ) = ln(0.0625).

N * ln(1/1.0075) = ln(0.0625).

N = ln(0.0625) / ln(1/1.0075).

Compute ln(0.0625) ≈ -2.5257.

Compute ln(1/1.0075) ≈ ln(0.99256) ≈ -0.00751.

So N ≈ (-2.5257) / (-0.00751) ≈ 336 months, which is 28 years. But since the actual payments are increasing, the period should be less than that. So 336 is just a fixed payment scenario.

Looking at the options, the highest is 200 months, which is 16.67 years. So the correct answer must be less than 336, but higher than, say, 120 months (10 years), since the payments are increasing.

Wait, but in the fixed payment scenario, 800 fixed payments would take 336 months, but with increasing payments, it should be shorter. So the correct N should be less than 336. Looking at the options, options go up to 200, so maybe around 160? Or perhaps 145?

Alternatively, perhaps I can try using the present value formula for the increasing payments for N=145.5 (option B) and see if it's near 100,000.

Wait, but without a calculator, this is tricky. Let's think of another approach.

Maybe I can model this as a series where each payment is slightly higher each month, so the principal reduces more quickly as time goes on.

Wait, perhaps I can approximate the average payment and multiply by the number of months, then discount to present value. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, but with present value.

Wait, the payment each month increases by a fixed percentage, not a fixed amount. So it's a geometric increase, not arithmetic. So the sum of the payments is a geometric series.

Wait, but the present value of each payment is discounted, so each term is [800*(1 + t/120)] / (1.0075)^t.

Hmm, maybe I can factor this as 800 * sum_{t=0}^N (1 + t/120) * (1/1.0075)^t.

Which is 800 * [sum_{t=0}^N (1/1.0075)^t + (1/120) sum_{t=0}^N t*(1/1.0075)^t ].

I think I can compute each sum separately.

First, compute S1 = sum_{t=0}^N (1/1.0075)^t.

This is a geometric series with ratio r = 1/1.0075 ≈ 0.99256.

The sum S1 = (1 - r^{N+1}) / (1 - r).

Similarly, S2 = sum_{t=0}^N t r^t.

As before, the formula for S2 is r (1 - (N+1) r^N + N r^{N+1}) ) / (1 - r)^2.

So, for a given N, I can compute S1 and S2, then compute PV = 800*(S1 + S2/120).

I need to find N such that PV = 100,000.

Let me try N=145.5 months (option B). But dealing with a fractional month is a bit odd, so perhaps it's better to try whole numbers.

Let me try N=145.

Compute S1 and S2 for N=145.

First, r = 1/1.0075 ≈ 0.992563143.

Compute S1 = (1 - r^{146}) / (1 - r).

Compute r^146: since r is less than 1, r^146 is a small number.

Compute ln(r) = ln(0.992563143) ≈ -0.00751.

So ln(r^146) = 146
