Question:

An American franchise operates as an importer and distributor of bicycles manufactured by a foreign country, and maintains several warehouses for the wholesale distribution of the bicycles. A warehouse located in a county handles the distribution of bicycles for several states. The bikes and bike tires are shipped separately to the county warehouse. The tires are mingled, stacked, and stored in the warehouse along with various other tires. The bicycles, on the other hand, arrive completely assembled in their shipping crates and remain on the loading docks. The county imposes an ad valorem property tax on the bikes and tires. The county's ad valorem tax may properly be assessed against the

Options:

A: bikes and tires, but only when they are stored in the warehouse.
B: bicycles only.
C: tires, but only while they are in the warehouse.
D: tires and bicycles.
E: bikes and tires, but only during the distribution process.
F: bicycles, but only while they are on the loading docks.
G: bicycles, but only if they are not in their shipping crates.
H: neither the tires nor the bicycles, unless they are being actively distributed.
I: neither the tires nor the bicycles.
J: tires only.

Okay, so I've got this question about property taxes, specifically ad valorem tax. Hmm, ad valorem means based on value, right? So the county is imposing this tax on the bikes and tires. The question is about whether the tax can be assessed against these items.

Let me read the scenario again. There's an American franchise that imports and distributes bicycles from a foreign country. They have several warehouses for wholesale distribution. One warehouse is in a particular county and handles distribution for several states. 

The bikes and tires are shipped separately. The tires are mingled, stacked, and stored in the warehouse along with other tires. So the tires are just part of a larger stock in the warehouse. On the other hand, the bicycles arrive completely assembled in their shipping crates and remain on the loading docks. So they're not unpacked or moved into the warehouse storage area yet.

The county is imposing an ad valorem property tax on both the bikes and tires. The question is, can they do that?

I remember that in property tax law, tangible personal property is generally taxable. But there are exceptions. One big exception is for goods in transit. I think if goods are just passing through and haven't come to rest, they might not be taxable. But once they are stored for a longer period, maybe for distribution, they become taxable.

So the tires are stored in the warehouse, mingled with others. That suggests they're part of the inventory for distribution. So they've come to rest there, right? They're not just passing through; they're being stored for eventual distribution to various states. So the tires would likely be taxable because they're part of the business's inventory in the county.

What about the bicycles? They're still on the loading docks in their shipping crates. Does that mean they're just temporarily there? Or have they come to rest? If they're on the loading dock and not yet moved into the warehouse, maybe they're still considered in transit. Or maybe once they arrive at the destination, even if still on the dock, they're no longer in transit.

Wait, I think the rule is that goods are taxable when they've reached their destination and are at rest. So if the bikes are delivered to the warehouse, which is their destination, then even if they're on the loading dock, they're no longer in transit. So they would be taxable.

Alternatively, if the warehouse is just a temporary stop before moving to another location, maybe not. But the question says the warehouse handles distribution for several states, so it's their destination for distribution purposes. The bikes arrive there, so they've reached their destination.

So both the tires and the bikes are taxable by the county because they are stored there as part of the business's inventory. So the tax can be assessed against both.

Looking at the options:

A: bikes and tires, but only when stored in the warehouse. Wait, the bikes are on the loading dock, not in the warehouse. So maybe A isn't correct because the bikes aren't stored in the warehouse yet.

D: tires and bicycles. So this would include both. The reasoning is that both are taxable because they've come to rest in the county, regardless of being in the warehouse or on the dock.

Wait, but do the bikes have to be inside the warehouse? Or is being on the loading dock at the warehouse sufficient? Because the warehouse is their destination.

I think the key is whether the goods have come to rest. If the bikes are delivered to the warehouse and are sitting on the dock, they've come to rest there. So they're taxable. Same with the tires in the warehouse. So both are subject to tax.

Looking back at the options:

D says tires and bicycles. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but option A says both, but only when stored in the warehouse. The bikes are on the loading dock, so maybe they aren't stored in the warehouse yet. So the tax on the bikes wouldn't apply under option A. But if the bikes are taxable even on the dock because they're at their destination, then option D is correct.

I think the correct answer is D.

The question revolves around whether an ad valorem property tax can be assessed against bicycles and tires stored in a county warehouse. The key considerations are whether the items are taxable under property tax law, particularly focusing on whether they are considered "goods in transit" or have "come to rest" at their destination.

- **Tires**: The tires are mingled, stacked, and stored in the warehouse along with other tires. This indicates that they have come to rest and are part of the inventory for distribution. As such, they are taxable.

- **Bicycles**: The bicycles arrive completely assembled in shipping crates and remain on the loading docks. The critical factor is whether they have come to rest. Since the warehouse is their destination for distribution, the bicycles are no longer in transit, even if they remain on the loading dock. Therefore, they are also taxable.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect because it limits taxation to items stored in the warehouse, but the bicycles are taxable even if on the loading dock.
- **Option D**: Correct because both the tires and bicycles are taxable, as they have come to rest at their destination.

Thus, the county's ad valorem tax may properly be assessed against both the tires and bicycles.

Answer: D
