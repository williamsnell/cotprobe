Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about VAR models and bi-directional feedback. Hmm, I remember from my econometrics class that VAR stands for Vector Autoregressive model. It's used to model multiple time series variables and their relationships.

The question is about equation 16, which I don't have in front of me, but I think I can recall the structure. A VAR model usually includes lagged values of the variables to capture relationships. So, for two variables, say Y and X, a bivariate VAR model might have equations like:

Y_t = a + bX_{t-1} + ... + e_t
X_t = c + dY_{t-1} + ... + f_t

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact setup here. Oh wait, the question mentions coefficients a, b, c, d, etc. Maybe equation 16 is a specific form. Oh right, in some models, each equation has different variables on the right side.

Wait, in a VAR model, each variable is expressed as a function of lagged values of itself and the other variables. So for two variables, Y and X, you have:

Y_t = a + bY_{t-1} + cX_{t-1} + error
X_t = d + eY_{t-1} + fX_{t-1} + error

Wait, but the question seems to refer to a specific equation, equation 16, which I can't see. So maybe in that equation, the variables are set up in a certain way. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to a model where each variable depends on the other, but with different coefficients.

Bi-directional feedback, or bi-directional causality, happens when each variable Granger-causes the other. Granger causality is tested by seeing if the coefficients on the lagged values of a variable in the other variable's equation are significant.

So, for Y causing X, we look at the coefficients of Y's lags in X's equation. Similarly, for X causing Y, we look at the coefficients of X's lags in Y's equation.

In a VAR model, each equation has its own set of coefficients. So, if I have two equations:

1. Y = a + b X_{t-1} + ... (other lags maybe)
2. X = c + d Y_{t-1} + ... 

So, for bi-directional feedback, both the coefficient b (which is the effect of X on Y) and the coefficient d (the effect of Y on X) need to be significant. Because that would mean X influences Y and Y influences X.

Wait, but the options here are about which coefficients need to be significant. So let's look at the options.

The options are:

A: a, b, c significant
B: a and c significant
C: a, b, d significant
D: b and d significant
E: a, d, c significant
F: a and c sig, b and d insignificant
G: b and d sig, a and c insignificant
H: a and d sig, b and c insignificant
I: b, c, d sig
J: b and c sig, a and d insignificant

Wait, but in the setup I thought, the key is whether the variables X and Y influence each other. So, in the Y equation, the coefficient on X (say, b) must be significant, and in the X equation, the coefficient on Y (say, d) must be significant.

So for bi-directional feedback, both b and d should be significant. Looking at the options, which one says that?

Option D says b and d are significant. Are there any other conditions? Because sometimes you might have other coefficients, like a and c, which are constants or other terms.

Wait, but the question is about the conditions for bi-directional feedback. So the presence of feedback depends only on whether each variable affects the other, which is determined by b and d being significant.

So the correct condition is that both b and d are significant. Let me check the options again.

Option D is "The b and d coefficients significant." So that's the one.

Wait, but the options include other possibilities. For example, option G says b and d are significant, and a and c are insignificant. So does bi-directional feedback require that the other coefficients (like a and c) are insignificant?

I don't think so. Because a and c are probably the intercept terms or coefficients for other variables. Wait, in the VAR model, each equation has an intercept (like a and c in my example). But for Granger causality, we're only concerned with the significance of the lagged variables, not the intercepts. So whether a and c are significant doesn't affect whether there's feedback between Y and X.

So the correct condition is just that b and d are significant, regardless of a and c. So looking at the options, option D says exactly that.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing up the variables. In equation 16, which variables are on which sides? Suppose equation 16 is about Y, and includes X's lag, and another equation about X includes Y's lag.

So in equation 16 (say, Y's equation), the coefficient for X's lag is b. In the X equation, the coefficient for Y's lag is d. So for bi-directional feedback, both b and d must be significant.

So the correct answer is option D.

To determine the conditions for bi-directional feedback in a VAR model, we analyze the relationships between the variables. Bi-directional feedback, or bi-directional causality, occurs when each variable Granger-causes the other. This means that the lagged values of one variable significantly influence the other variable, and vice versa.

In a bivariate VAR model, the equations might look like:

1. \( Y_t = a + bX_{t-1} + \text{error} \)
2. \( X_t = c + dY_{t-1} + \text{error} \)

Here, \( b \) represents the effect of \( X \) on \( Y \), and \( d \) represents the effect of \( Y \) on \( X \). For bi-directional feedback to exist, both \( b \) and \( d \) must be significant. The significance of other coefficients, such as intercepts \( a \) and \( c \), does not affect the presence of feedback between the variables.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option D**: "The \( b \) and \( d \) coefficients significant" correctly identifies the condition for bi-directional feedback, as both coefficients must be significant for mutual influence.
- Other options either include unnecessary conditions (e.g., requiring \( a \) or \( c \) to be significant) or exclude \( b \) and \( d \), which are essential for bi-directional feedback.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**D**
