Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about counseling minority group members. Hmm, I'm not too sure about this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking what research indicates about their counseling behaviors.

The options are A through D. Let me go through each one.

Option A says they are more likely to seek group counseling than individual. I'm not sure. I remember that sometimes cultural factors influence whether people prefer group or individual settings. Maybe some minority groups prefer group because of community support, but I don't recall if research shows they seek it more than individual. Not certain.

Option B says they remain in counseling for the same length as nonminority. I think I've heard that minority clients might have different retention rates. Maybe they're less likely to stay as long. So B might not be correct.

Option C says they terminate significantly earlier. That rings a bell. I think there's research indicating that minority clients sometimes don't stay in counseling as long. Maybe because of cultural differences, trust issues with the counselor, or other barriers. So C could be the answer.

Option D states they seek counseling at the same rate as non-minority. I don't think that's right. I remember hearing that minority groups often underutilize mental health services. So D is probably incorrect.

Putting it together, the correct answer is likely C. They terminate earlier than non-minority clients.

The correct answer is based on research suggesting that minority clients may terminate counseling earlier due to factors like cultural differences or trust issues.

Answer: C
