Okay, so I've got this question about zero population growth, and I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but I'll try to think it through. Zero population growth (ZPG) is when a population stops growing, right? So that means the number of people isn't increasing or decreasing. But how exactly does that happen?

I remember that ZPG occurs when the birth rate equals the death rate. Wait, but isn't that the same as replacement fertility? Let me clarify. Replacement fertility is the fertility rate at which the population replaces itself from one generation to the next. I think in developed countries, that's usually around a total fertility rate of about 2.1, accounting for mortality rates and such. So if total fertility is 2 (option C), that might be replacement, but maybe not exactly 2 because of factors like infant mortality.

Looking at the options, option D says "Birth rate equals death rate, excluding immigration and emigration." Hmm. So if the birth and death rates are equal, then the population size remains the same. But wait, immigration and emigration can affect the population too. If we exclude them, then yeah, births equal deaths would mean ZPG. But if we include migration, then you have to consider net migration as well.

Wait, another thought: zero population growth doesn't necessarily require that the number of births equals the number of deaths in absolute terms, because immigration and emigration can offset that. So the actual formula might involve all these factors. But the question is about achieving ZPG, so maybe the key is that the natural increase (births minus deaths) plus net migration equals zero.

Wait, actually, the formula for population change is: Population change = (Births - Deaths) + (Immigration - Emigration). So for ZPG, the population change must be zero. That could happen if (Births - Deaths) = (Emigration - Immigration). But the question is phrased in a way that asks when ZPG is achieved. So perhaps the simplest scenario is when births equal deaths, and there's no net migration, or when the in and out migration balance each other.

But looking at the options, option D says "Birth rate equals death rate, excluding immigration and emigration." So if we're ignoring migration, then yes, births equal deaths would mean no growth. But in reality, migration can't be ignored, but maybe the question is simplifying it.

Alternatively, option I says "Births + immigration = deaths + emigration." Wait, that would mean that (Births - Deaths) + (Immigration - Emigration) equals zero, which is exactly the condition for zero population growth. So that's another possibility.

Wait, let me go back to the question. The question is asking when ZPG is achieved. So if the population is not growing, the total change is zero. So the correct condition is when the number of births plus immigrants equals the number of deaths plus emigrants. So that would be option I.

But then I have to look at all the options again.

Option A: Replacement fertility is achieved. I think replacement fertility leads to ZPG in the long run because each generation replaces itself. But does it immediately achieve ZPG, or does it take time as the population ages?

Option D: Birth rate equals death rate, excluding migration. So that's the natural increase being zero, but if migration isn't zero, the population could still change. So maybe this isn't the complete picture.

Option I: Births + immigration = deaths + emigration. That's the full equation for zero change. So I think that's the correct condition.

Wait, but the question is multiple choice, and I have to choose between the options. Let me read each option again.

Option D says "Birth rate equals death rate, excluding immigration and emigration." So in that case, if BR=DR, then natural increase is zero, and population remains the same. But that's only if there's no migration. So if someone says BR=DR, then yes, but if there's migration, you have to include it.

However, the question is about ZPG, which can happen even with migration as long as the in and out flows balance. So the precise condition is that (Births + Immigration) equals (Deaths + Emigration). So that's option I.

But wait, looking back, the options are:

A: Replacement fertility is achieved.

C: Total fertility equals 2.

So replacement fertility is usually around 2.1, but option C is total fertility equals 2. Maybe that's close enough.

But wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think differently. Zero population growth occurs when the population size is stable, so the number of births must equal the number of deaths, considering migration.

Wait, hold on. Let's think about the concept of ZPG. It refers to a state where the population is not growing or declining. So, in terms of rates, the birth rate equals the death rate, and net migration is zero. But if net migration isn't zero, then the sum has to balance.

Wait, perhaps the simplest way is that ZPG occurs when the number of births equals the number of deaths. But that's only if migration is zero. But the question doesn't specify whether migration is included or excluded.

Looking at the options again:

Option D: Birth rate equals death rate, excluding immigration and emigration.

So that suggests that when BR=DR, and migration is ignored, then ZPG is achieved. But in reality, ZPG could also be achieved when BR plus immigration equals DR plus emigration.

But the options don't seem to have both possibilities. Let's see the options:

Option D says BR=DR, excluding migration. So that would mean that without considering migration, the population is stable. But if you include migration, then you have to have births + immigration = deaths + emigration.

So the correct condition for ZPG is when (B + I) = (D + E). So that's option I.

But wait, looking at the options, option I says "Births + immigration = Deaths + Emigration." So that's exactly the condition where the population doesn't change. So that's the correct answer.

Alternatively, option D might be a trap because it's only considering BR and DR without migration, but in reality, migration affects the population as well.

Wait, but the term ZPG can sometimes be used to refer to when the natural increase is zero, meaning BR=DR, regardless of migration. Or does it include migration?

I think in demographic terms, ZPG is when the total population isn't changing, so all factors are considered. So the correct condition would include migration.

So the correct option is I: Births + immigration = Deaths + Emigration.

But another angle: sometimes ZPG is defined when the crude birth rate equals the crude death rate, without considering migration. So perhaps option D is correct.

Now I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to recall. The standard definition is that zero population growth occurs when the number of births plus immigrants equals the number of deaths plus emigrants. So that's option I.

But wait, the question is phrased as "Zero population growth (ZPG) is achieved when..." So the correct condition is when the population is not changing, which happens when births + immigration = deaths + emigration.

So the correct answer would be option I.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option D says "Birth rate equals death rate, excluding immigration and emigration." So this implies that without migration, BR=DR, leading to ZPG. But if migration is present, it's not accounted for.

Alternatively, option I includes migration.

So the correct answer should be option I.

But I'm a bit confused because I remember that ZPG can also be when the birth rate equals death rate, and migration is zero. But another possibility is when the sum of births and immigration equals deaths and emigration.

So perhaps the correct answer is option D or I.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about each option.

Option D: BR=DR, excluding migration. So when BR=DR and migration is zero, then population is stable. But if migration isn't zero, then you have to account for it.

Option I: (Births + Immigration) = (Deaths + Emigration). That's the condition where the total population change is zero.

So which option is correct? The question is about when ZPG is achieved, which is when the population size remains constant. So that requires that the total in-flows equal out-flows, which is option I.

But wait, the options don't have this exact wording. Let me check:

Option I says "Births + immigration = Deaths + Emigration." So that's exactly the condition where the population doesn't change. So that's correct.

So the answer should be option I.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes in exams, ZPG is considered when the crude birth rate equals the crude death rate, without considering migration. So then option D might be correct.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn here. Let me think of it this way: the term "zero population growth" can have two different interpretations. One is that the natural increase (births minus deaths) is zero, which would mean BR=DR, and that's option D. The other is that the total change, including migration, is zero, which is option I.

But I think in the context of population dynamics, ZPG usually refers to when the total population isn't changing, which would include all factors, including migration. So option I would be correct.

Wait, but looking again, the options are:

D: Birth rate equals death rate, excluding immigration and emigration.

I: Births + immigration = Deaths + Emigration.

So I is the condition where the population remains the same. So that's the correct condition for ZPG.

So the answer should be option I.

Wait, but earlier I thought about replacement fertility. Option A is replacement fertility. But replacement fertility usually leads to ZPG only in the long run because it takes time for the age structure to stabilize. So it's not the immediate cause.

So to sum up, the correct answer is option I.
</think>

Zero population growth (ZPG) is achieved when the population size remains stable, meaning the total number of people is not increasing or decreasing. This occurs when the inflows (births and immigration) balance the outflows (deaths and emigration). 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Replacement fertility is achieved. While replacement fertility (often around a total fertility rate of 2.1) is necessary for long-term population stability, it does not immediately achieve ZPG unless the population's age structure stabilizes, which takes time.

- **Option B**: The population decreases to a certain level and then increases again. This describes population fluctuations, not ZPG.

- **Option C**: Total fertility equals 2. Total fertility of 2 is close to replacement fertility but does not guarantee ZPG because factors like mortality and migration are not considered.

- **Option D**: Birth rate equals death rate, excluding immigration and emigration. This condition would stabilize the population only if migration is zero. However, ZPG can also occur when migration is present but balanced by other factors.

- **Option E**: Birth rate is less than death rate. This would lead to a declining population, not ZPG.

- **Option F**: CBR – CDR = 5–2. This is unclear and does not represent a standard demographic equation.

- **Option G**: Total fertility = 3. This is above replacement fertility and would lead to population growth, not ZPG.

- **Option H**: Birth rate is twice the death rate. This would result in rapid population growth, not ZPG.

- **Option I**: Births + immigration = Deaths + Emigration. This is the correct condition for ZPG, as it ensures the total population remains constant when all factors (births, deaths, immigration, and emigration) are considered.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option I**, as it accurately reflects the condition for zero population growth when all demographic factors are included.
