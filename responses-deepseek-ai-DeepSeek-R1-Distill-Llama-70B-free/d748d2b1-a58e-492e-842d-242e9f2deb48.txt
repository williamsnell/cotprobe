Okay, so I've got this question here about consumer behavior and purchase decisions. Let's see what it's asking. The question is about which products reflect a high level of involvement from the purchaser. The key points mentioned are high perceived risk, and that consumers spend a lot of time and effort searching, formulating, and making the decision.

Hmm, I remember that in marketing, products are often categorized based on how much thought and effort a buyer puts into purchasing them. There's something called the "hierarchy of effects" or maybe it's about the types of buying behavior. Oh right, there are different types like routine, limited, and extensive decision-making.

So, high involvement would mean the consumer is really invested in this purchase. They probably do a lot of research, compare different options, and take their time because the decision is important to them. High perceived risk could mean that the product is expensive, has long-term implications, or perhaps it's something that they'll use for a long time.

Looking at the options: A is services. Wait, services can be high involvement, but I'm not sure if that's the primary answer here. Services are intangible, which might make the decision harder, but maybe not always. B is perishable items, like food or something that spoils quickly. Those are probably low involvement because they're bought frequently and without much thought. C is impulse purchases, which by definition are low involvement; you buy them on the spur of the moment without much planning. D is non-durable goods, which are things like toiletries or paper products. These are usually routine purchases, so low involvement again.

E is discounted items. Discounts might attract people, but whether it's high involvement depends on the product. If it's a discounted TV, maybe, but if it's a discounted snack, probably not. F is fast-moving consumer goods, which are typically low-cost, routine items like groceries. So that's low involvement. G is durable goods. Durable goods are things like cars, appliances, furnitureâ€”items that last a long time. These usually involve more consideration because they're expensive and used over many years. So this sounds like high involvement.

H is generic products, which are usually cheaper versions of brand-name items. People might not spend as much time deciding since they're often cheaper and the differences are minimal. I is convenience products, which are things you buy regularly and quickly, like milk or toilet paper. So low involvement.

Putting it all together, the question is pointing towards products that require extensive decision-making and high perceived risk. Durable goods fit because they're often expensive and important. So the answer should be G: Durable goods.

The question asks which products reflect a high level of involvement in the purchase decision, characterized by high perceived risk and significant time spent searching, formulating, and making the decision. High involvement typically applies to expensive, long-term, or impactful purchases. 

Analyzing the options:
- **A: Services** can sometimes involve high involvement but are not the best fit here.
- **B: Perishable items** and **F: Fast-moving consumer goods** are low involvement, as they are routine purchases.
- **C: Impulse purchases** are, by definition, low involvement.
- **D: Non-durable goods** are typically routine and low involvement.
- **E: Discounted items** vary depending on the product but are not inherently high involvement.
- **G: Durable goods**, such as cars or appliances, are expensive, long-lasting, and require extensive decision-making, making them high involvement.
- **H: Generic products** and **I: Convenience products** are generally low involvement.

Thus, the correct answer is **G: Durable goods**, as they best fit the description of high involvement and high perceived risk.

Answer: G
