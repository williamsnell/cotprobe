Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about equilibrium, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says.

The reaction is H₂ + I₂ ⇌ 2HI. So, hydrogen gas reacting with iodine gas to form hydrogen iodide. The problem gives me some initial conditions and then a change, and I need to find the equilibrium constant Kp.

Initially, they introduced 1 mole of H₂ and 3 moles of I₂ into a flask with volume V at temperature T. And from that, x moles of HI are formed. Then, they add 2 more moles of H₂, making the total H₂ 3 moles. After that, the amount of HI formed is 2x. I need to find Kp.

Hmm. So I think I should set up the ICE tables for both situations and then relate the two to find Kp.

First, let's consider the initial situation without the additional H₂. The reaction starts with H₂ and I₂, and some HI is formed. Let me write the ICE table.

Initial:
[H₂] = 1 mole / V
[I₂] = 3 moles / V
[HI] = 0

Change:
[H₂] decreases by a certain amount as the reaction proceeds. Let's call the change 'a'. But wait, for every mole of H₂ and I₂ that reacts, they produce 2 moles of HI. So for each mole of H₂ consumed, 1 mole of I₂ is consumed, and 2 moles of HI are produced.

Wait, alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of extent of reaction. Let's say the change is 'a' for H₂ and I₂. Then the change for HI would be 2a.

Wait, but initially, when they form x moles of HI, that's after reaction. So x = 2a. Because initially, HI starts at 0, so the change is +2a, which equals x. So a = x/2.

So at equilibrium initially, the concentrations would be:

[H₂] = (1 - a)/V = (1 - x/2)/V
[I₂] = (3 - a)/V = (3 - x/2)/V
[HI] = (2a)/V = x/V

Wait, no. Wait, the change for HI is +2a, so the concentration is 2a/V = x/V. So that makes sense. So a is x/(2), since 2a = x.

So the initial equilibrium concentrations are:
[H₂] = (1 - x/2)/V
[I₂] = (3 - x/2)/V
[HI] = x/(V)

Then, the equilibrium constant Kp is given by ( [HI]^2 ) / ( [H₂][I₂] )

So Kp = ( (x/V)^2 ) / ( ( (1 - x/2)/V ) * ( (3 - x/2)/V ) )

Simplify that. The V terms would cancel because each concentration is divided by V.

Kp = (x²) / [ (1 - x/2)(3 - x/2) ) ]

That's the Kp for the first case.

Now, the second scenario: they add 2 more moles of H₂. So the initial moles now are H₂ = 3 moles, I₂ = 3 moles. Wait, no, wait. Let me re-examine the setup.

Wait no, the initial setup is 1 mole H₂ and 3 moles I₂. Then, after adding 2 moles H₂, the initial moles become 3 H₂ and 3 I₂. Oh wait, wait, no. Because when you add 2 moles H₂, it's added to the same flask. So the initial moles before the second reaction are 3 H₂ and 3 I₂. But wait, no, wait. Because in the first case, some reaction had already occurred. Oh wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. The initial setup is that in the first case, after introducing 1 mole H₂ and 3 moles I₂, the system reaches equilibrium, forming x moles HI. Then, in the second case, they add 2 more moles of H₂, making the total H₂ 3 moles, and then the system reaches a new equilibrium, with 2x moles HI formed.

Wait, but wait. When you add more H₂, does that mean you're adding it to the reactants, or to the products? Well, in this case, H₂ is a reactant. So adding more H₂ will shift the equilibrium towards producing more HI.

So in the second case, the initial moles (before the second reaction) would be H₂: 3 moles (1 + 2 added), I₂: 3 - (x/2) moles left (since from the first reaction, x/2 moles of each H₂ and I₂ were consumed to form x moles of HI. Or wait, no. Because in the first scenario, the system goes to equilibrium, so the initial moles are 1 H₂ and 3 I₂, and after reaction, the moles are (1 - a) H₂, (3 - a) I₂, and 2a HI, where a is x/2.

Wait, no, because a was the extent of reaction in the first case. So a = x/(2), since 2a = x.

So after the first reaction, the moles are:

H₂: 1 - a = 1 - x/2

I₂: 3 - a = 3 - x/2

HI: x

Then, you add 2 moles H₂. So the new initial moles for the second scenario are:

H₂: (1 - x/2) + 2 = 3 - x/2

I₂: 3 - x/2 (unchanged, since we only added H₂)

HI: x (since adding H₂ doesn't directly change HI, but the system will adjust)

Wait, but when you add more H₂, the system will shift towards producing more HI. So the second scenario starts with H₂ = 3 - x/2, I₂ = 3 - x/2, and HI = x. Then, it reacts further. Let's denote the change in the second case as 'b'.

In the second case, since the system is at equilibrium again, the change will be some 'b' moles of H₂ and I₂ consumed to form 2b moles HI.

So the initial concentrations before the second reaction are:

[H₂] = (3 - x/2)/V

[I₂] = (3 - x/2)/V

[HI] = x/V

But wait, actually, when you add H₂, the volume V remains the same, so concentrations change accordingly.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the second case as a new equilibrium. So the initial moles in the second case are:

H₂: 3 moles (1 + 2 added)

I₂: 3 moles (since the initial 3, but in the first case, some reacted, but when you add H₂, does that affect I₂? No, because adding H₂ doesn't directly add I₂ or remove it. So in the second case, the initial moles are H₂: 3, I₂: 3 - x/2, and HI: x.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating it. Let's think again. 

In the first situation:

Initial moles: H₂ =1, I₂=3, HI=0.

At equilibrium: H₂=1 -a, I₂=3 -a, HI=2a. So 2a = x → a = x/2.

So H₂ = 1 - x/2, I₂ =3 -x/2, HI=x.

In the second situation, 2 moles H₂ are added. So the new initial moles are H₂ = (1 - x/2) +2= 3 -x/2, I₂=3 -x/2, HI=x.

Wait, but that's the initial state before the second reaction. Now, the system will adjust again to reach a new equilibrium. So the change here is some amount 'b' in the forward direction.

So the change would be: H₂ decreases by b, I₂ decreases by b, HI increases by 2b.

At the new equilibrium in the second case:

H₂: 3 -x/2 -b

I₂: (3 -x/2) -b

HI: x + 2b

But the problem states that the amount of HI formed is 2x. So the new HI is 2x. Therefore, x + 2b = 2x → 2b = x → b = x/2.

So substituting that, the new concentrations are:

[H₂] = (3 -x/2) - (x/2) = 3 -x/2 -x/2 = 3 -x

[I₂] = (3 -x/2) - (x/2) = 3 -x

[HI] = x + 2*(x/2) = x +x = 2x.

So the new equilibrium concentrations are:

[H₂] = (3 -x)/V

[I₂] = (3 -x)/V

[HI] = 2x/V

Now, the equilibrium constant Kp in the second case should be the same as in the first case because the temperature is the same. So we can set the two expressions for Kp equal to each other.

From the first case:

Kp = (x²/V²) / [ ( (1 -x/2)/V ) * ( (3 -x/2)/V ) )

Simplifying, V terms cancel:

Kp = x² / [ (1 -x/2)(3 -x/2) ]

From the second case:

Kp = ( (2x/V)^2 ) / [ ( (3 -x)/V ) * ( (3 -x)/V ) )

Simplify:

Kp = (4x²/V²) / [ ( (3 -x)^2 ) / V² ) ] → 4x² / (3 -x)^2

So set the two expressions for Kp equal:

x² / [ (1 -x/2)(3 -x/2) ) ] = 4x² / (3 -x)^2

We can cancel x² from both sides (assuming x ≠ 0, which it isn't because HI is formed).

1 / [ (1 -x/2)(3 -x/2) ) ] = 4 / (3 -x)^2

Take reciprocals:

(1 -x/2)(3 -x/2) ) = (3 -x)^2 /4

Multiply both sides by 4:

4*(1 -x/2)(3 -x/2) = (3 -x)^2

Expand the left side:

First compute (1 -x/2)(3 -x/2):

= 1*(3) +1*(-x/2) + (-x/2)*3 + (-x/2)*(-x/2)

= 3 -x/2 - 3x/2 + x²/4

Combine like terms:

3 - (x/2 + 3x/2) + x²/4 = 3 - 2x + x²/4

Multiply by 4:

4*(3 -2x + x²/4 ) → 12 -8x +x²

The right side is (3 -x)^2 = 9 -6x +x²

Set them equal:

12 -8x +x² = 9 -6x +x²

Subtract x² from both sides:

12 -8x =9 -6x

Bring all terms to left:

12 -8x -9 +6x =0 → 3 -2x =0 → 2x=3 →x= 3/2.

So x is 3/2.

Now, substitute x=3/2 into the expression for Kp from either case. Let's take the second case because it's simpler.

Kp = 4x²/(3 -x)^2.

x=3/2 → x²= (9/4)

3 -x = 3 - 3/2 = 3/2 → (3 -x)^2 = (9/4)

So Kp = 4*(9/4) / (9/4) ) → 4*(9/4) * (4/9) ) = 4*( (9/4)*(4/9) ) ) → 4*1 =4.

So Kp is 4.

Looking back at the options, option B is 4.

To solve the problem, we analyze the equilibrium system for the reaction **H₂ + I₂ ⇌ 2HI** under two different conditions. The goal is to calculate the equilibrium constant \( K_p \).

---

### First Case:
Initially, 1 mole of H₂ and 3 moles of I₂ are introduced into a flask of volume \( V \). At equilibrium, \( x \) moles of HI are formed. Using the stoichiometry of the reaction:

- **Initial concentrations**:
  \[
  [H₂] = \frac{1}{V}, \quad [I₂] = \frac{3}{V}, \quad [HI] = 0
  \]

- **Change in concentrations**:
  Let the extent of reaction be \( a \). Then:
  \[
  [H₂] = \frac{1 - a}{V}, \quad [I₂] = \frac{3 - a}{V}, \quad [HI] = \frac{2a}{V}
  \]

Since \( x = 2a \), we have \( a = \frac{x}{2} \). Substituting this, the equilibrium concentrations become:
\[
[H₂] = \frac{1 - \frac{x}{2}}{V}, \quad [I₂] = \frac{3 - \frac{x}{2}}{V}, \quad [HI] = \frac{x}{V}
\]

The equilibrium constant \( K_p \) is given by:
\[
K_p = \frac{[HI]^2}{[H₂][I₂]} = \frac{\left(\frac{x}{V}\right)^2}{\left(\frac{1 - \frac{x}{2}}{V}\right)\left(\frac{3 - \frac{x}{2}}{V}\right)}
\]

Simplifying:
\[
K_p = \frac{x^2}{\left(1 - \frac{x}{2}\right)\left(3 - \frac{x}{2}\right)}
\]

---

### Second Case:
After adding 2 more moles of H₂, the initial moles become:
\[
\text{H₂} = 3 \, \text{moles}, \quad \text{I₂} = 3 \, \text{moles}, \quad \text{HI} = x \, \text{moles}
\]

At the new equilibrium, the amount of HI formed is \( 2x \). Let the additional extent of reaction be \( b \). Then:
\[
[H₂] = \frac{3 - b}{V}, \quad [I₂] = \frac{3 - b}{V}, \quad [HI] = \frac{x + 2b}{V}
\]

Since \( x + 2b = 2x \), we find \( b = \frac{x}{2} \). Substituting this, the equilibrium concentrations become:
\[
[H₂] = \frac{3 - x}{V}, \quad [I₂] = \frac{3 - x}{V}, \quad [HI] = \frac{2x}{V}
\]

The equilibrium constant \( K_p \) is:
\[
K_p = \frac{[HI]^2}{[H₂][I₂]} = \frac{\left(\frac{2x}{V}\right)^2}{\left(\frac{3 - x}{V}\right)\left(\frac{3 - x}{V}\right)}
\]

Simplifying:
\[
K_p = \frac{4x^2}{(3 - x)^2}
\]

---

### Equating \( K_p \) from Both Cases:
Since \( K_p \) is the same in both cases, we equate the two expressions:
\[
\frac{x^2}{\left(1 - \frac{x}{2}\right)\left(3 - \frac{x}{2}\right)} = \frac{4x^2}{(3 - x)^2}
\]

Cancel \( x^2 \) (assuming \( x \neq 0 \)):
\[
\frac{1}{\left(1 - \frac{x}{2}\right)\left(3 - \frac{x}{2}\right)} = \frac{4}{(3 - x)^2}
\]

Cross-multiply and simplify:
\[
(3 - x)^2 = 4\left(1 - \frac{x}{2}\right)\left(3 - \frac{x}{2}\right)
\]

Expand both sides:
\[
9 - 6x + x^2 = 4\left(3 - 2x + \frac{x^2}{4}\right)
\]

Simplify:
\[
9 - 6x + x^2 = 12 - 8x + x^2
\]

Cancel \( x^2 \) and solve for \( x \):
\[
9 - 6x = 12 - 8x
\]

\[
2x = 3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \frac{3}{2}
\]

---

### Calculate \( K_p \):
Substitute \( x = \frac{3}{2} \) into the second case expression for \( K_p \):
\[
K_p = \frac{4x^2}{(3 - x)^2}
\]

\[
K_p = \frac{4\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2}{\left(3 - \frac{3}{2}\right)^2} = \frac{4\left(\frac{9}{4}\right)}{\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2} = \frac{9}{\frac{9}{4}} = 4
\]

---

### Final Answer:
The equilibrium constant \( K_p \) is **4**.
