Question:

A man was the owner of the newly constructed hotel in a city. On March 15, the man received a telephone call from a salesperson who was a distributor of hotel equipment. The salesperson offered to sell the man 1,000 fire extinguishers for his hotel. The salesperson told the man that the cost of the fire extinguishers would be $35,000 (or $35 apiece), payable 90 days after delivery. The salesperson promised to have the fire extinguishers installed no later than April 15. On March 16, the man telephoned the salesperson and accepted the offer. The following day, the man mailed the following memo to the salesperson:"Please be advised that I shall take a 15 percent discount for cash payment seven days after installation. " The salesperson received the man's correspondence on March 20. On April 1, the salesperson sent a telegram to the man, stating: "It's apparent we don't have an enforceable contract in effect. I will not be delivering the fire extinguishers on April 15 or any other time. "The man brings suit against the salesperson for breach of contract. The salesperson asserts the defense of the statute of frauds under the UCC. Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the salesperson's defenses?

Options:

A: The salesperson's defense is valid, because the man failed to pay for the fire extinguishers within the specified 90 days.
B: The salesperson's defense is valid, because the man's memo was inconsistent with the terms of the salesperson's oral offer.
C: The salesperson's defense is valid, because the man's memo was not sufficient to indicate that a contract was formed.
D: The salesperson's defense is not valid, because the salesperson has breached the contract by failing to deliver the fire extinguishers on the agreed date.
E: The salesperson's defense is not valid, because the man's memo is considered a written contract under the UCC.
F: The salesperson's defense is valid, because the man's memo did not include a signature, which is required for a contract to be valid under the UCC.
G: The salesperson's defense is not valid, because under the UCC the statute of frauds is not applicable in agreements between merchants.
H: The salesperson's defense is not valid, because the man accepted the offer before the salesperson decided to terminate it.
I: The salesperson's defense is not valid, because the salesperson failed to respond to the man's memo within a reasonable period of time.

Okay, so I've got this contract law question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading through the problem carefully.

So, there's a man who owns a new hotel. On March 15, he gets a call from a salesperson who sells hotel equipment. The salesperson offers to sell him 1,000 fire extinguishers. The cost is $35,000, which is $35 each, and it's payable 90 days after delivery. The salesperson also promises to install them by April 15. 

The next day, March 16, the man calls and accepts the offer. Then, on March 17, he sends a memo to the salesperson. The memo says he'll take a 15% discount if he pays cash seven days after installation. The salesperson gets this memo on March 20.

On April 1, the salesperson sends a telegram saying there's no enforceable contract and won't deliver the extinguishers on April 15 or any other time. The man sues for breach, and the salesperson uses the statute of frauds as a defense under the UCC.

So the question is about whether the salesperson's defense using the statute of frauds is valid. The options are A to J, but I'll focus on the given options.

First, I need to recall the UCC statute of frauds requirements. Under the UCC, contracts for the sale of goods over $500 must be in writing to be enforceable, unless an exception applies. The exceptions include when the goods are specially manufactured, when payment has been made and accepted, or when the parties have made a written confirmation that's been signed and neither party objects within 10 days.

In this case, the contract is for 1,000 extinguishers at $35 each, so total is $35,000, which is way over $500. So normally, the contract needs to be in writing. But wait, the man sent a memo on March 17, which the salesperson received on March 20. So is that memo sufficient as a written contract?

Also, when the man accepted the offer on March 16, that would form an oral contract. But the statute of frauds requires a writing for enforceability. So unless an exception applies, the oral contract wouldn't be enforceable.

But the man sent this memo. Let's look at what the memo says. It says he'll take a 15% discount for cash payment seven days after installation. So this is a proposed modification to the payment terms. Now, under UCC ยง 2-209, a written confirmation between merchants can suffice if neither objects within 10 days. But wait, the man is a hotel owner, and the salesperson is a distributor, so they might both qualify as merchants.

So, the salesperson's offer was oral, and the man accepted orally. Then the man sends a memo that says he wants a discount for cash payment. Is this memo a written confirmation of the contract?

Wait, the memo is sent after the oral acceptance. The original agreement was oral, but then the man sends a memo that adds a term about the discount. So is this memo a written confirmation of the entire agreement, or is it trying to modify the agreement?

If the memo is a written confirmation, then under UCC ยง 2-201(2), if both parties are merchants, a written confirmation is sufficient unless someone objects within 10 days. But the man's memo is not just a confirmation; it's adding a new term about the discount. So the original oral contract didn't include that discount. So the memo is proposing a modification.

Wait, but the original offer by the salesperson was for payment 90 days after delivery. The man is now saying he'll take a 15% discount if he pays within seven days of installation. So that's a different payment term. So the man is trying to modify the contract.

Under UCC ยง 2-209(2), a signed agreement modifying a contract needs to be in writing, unless the modification is for additional or substitute security. But wait, here the memo isn't signed by both parties. The man sent it, but the salesperson didn't sign or agree to it. So the modification would not be enforceable unless it's in writing and signed by both, unless an exception applies.

Alternatively, if the man's memo is considered a written confirmation of the prior oral agreement, but with an additional term, then under the UCC, the confirmation would be sufficient if neither party objects within 10 days. But the original oral agreement didn't include the discount. So the memo adds a term, making it a proposed modification.

Wait, perhaps the memo is an attempt to modify the contract. But since the contract was oral, and the memo is a writing that includes terms of the agreement, but adds a new term, the question is whether the memo satisfies the statute of frauds for the original contract.

Alternatively, maybe the memo is being considered as a written contract. Let's think: The original contract was oral, but the memo is a writing that could serve as a written contract. However, for the statute of frauds, the writing must be sufficient to indicate that a contract has been made. It doesn't need to be a formal contract, just something that shows the parties agreed to the essential terms.

The memo says, "Please be advised that I shall take a 15 percent discount for cash payment seven days after installation." It doesn't mention the quantity, price, or delivery terms. So it's unclear whether the memo, on its own, would satisfy the statute of frauds because it lacks essential terms like quantity and price.

Wait, but the man is responding after already accepting the offer. So the memo might be referencing the prior oral agreement. If that's the case, then perhaps the memo, when read in context, is sufficient as a written confirmation. But the memo only mentions a discount and payment term, not the quantity or price. So it might not be sufficient on its own to satisfy the statute of frauds.

Alternatively, perhaps the memo, when combined with the prior oral agreement, is enough. But the statute of frauds requires the writing to be sufficient on its own to show a contract. So if the memo doesn't include all the essential terms, it might not be sufficient.

Wait, another angle: the man's memo might be an offer to modify the contract. If the salesperson didn't accept it, then the original contract remains as is. But since the salesperson is arguing that there's no enforceable contract, perhaps because the memo's introduction of a new term without acceptance means there's no meeting of the minds.

So, going back to the statute of frauds defense. The salesperson will argue that the oral contract isn't enforceable because it's not in writing. But the man sent a memo that could be considered a written confirmation. However, the memo introduces a new term, so it might not confirm the original agreement but instead propose a modification.

In that case, the memo doesn't serve as a written confirmation of the original oral contract, because it's trying to change the terms. Therefore, the original contract remains oral, and thus not enforceable under the statute of frauds.

Wait, but the man accepted the offer on March 16, making an oral contract. Then, on March 17, he sends a memo that adds a term. If that memo is a written confirmation of the contract, but with an additional term, then under UCC 2-201, is that sufficient?

UCC 2-201(1) says that a contract for sale of goods over $500 must be in writing. But 2-201(2) says that between merchants, a written confirmation is enough unless someone objects within 10 days.

In this case, the memo is from the man (a merchant) to the salesperson (also a merchant). So the memo could serve as a written confirmation. But the memo doesn't just confirm; it adds a term about the discount. So the question is whether adding that term makes the memo not a confirmation but an attempt to modify.

If the memo is a confirmation with an additional term, then under UCC 2-201(2), it's sufficient unless the recipient objects within 10 days. The salesperson received it on March 20. The salesperson sent a telegram on April 1, which is 12 days later. So the objection was made after the 10-day period. Therefore, the confirmation would be effective, and the memo would suffice to take the contract out of the statute of frauds.

But wait, the memo's additional term is a proposal to modify. The original contract didn't include that discount. So the memo is both a confirmation and a proposal for a modification. However, the salesperson didn't agree to that modification. But under UCC 2-209(2), a modification doesn't need to be in writing unless it's for a security interest. So the man's proposal to modify by offering a discount in exchange for quicker payment could be an oral modification, but it's in writing here.

But the key point is whether the memo serves as a written confirmation of the original contract. If it does, then the statute of frauds is satisfied, because it's a written confirmation between merchants, and the salesperson didn't object within 10 days.

Wait, the memo doesn't mention the quantity, the price, or delivery terms. It only mentions the discount and payment term. So does it indicate that a contract has been made? Or is it just about the payment?

The memo says, "I shall take a 15 percent discount..." which implies that there's an existing agreement from which he's taking a discount. So perhaps the memo is sufficient because it refers to an existing contract, and provides enough detail to indicate that a contract was formed. So the quantity, etc., are in the prior oral agreement, and the memo refers to that.

But under the statute of frauds, the writing must contain the essential terms (quantity, price, etc.), but it doesn't have to be in a single document. If multiple documents are used, they can be read together. But in this case, the memo is the only writing. So it must, on its own, indicate that a contract was formed.

Wait, but the memo doesn't mention the quantity or the price. So perhaps it's insufficient on its own. Therefore, the memo doesn't satisfy the statute of frauds because it lacks essential terms.

Alternatively, perhaps the memo, when combined with the prior oral agreement, is enough. But the statute of frauds requires the writing itself to be sufficient, not in combination with prior oral statements.

So, the memo is insufficient because it doesn't include the quantity, etc. Therefore, the salesperson's defense under the statute of frauds is valid because the memo doesn't meet the requirements.

Wait, but the man's memo may not be the only writing. The salesperson made an offer over the phone, and the man accepted. The memo is a subsequent writing. So perhaps the memo, along with the prior oral agreement, is enough. But I'm not sure about that. The statute of frauds requires the writing to show that a contract was made, but it doesn't have to include all terms, as long as it's clear that a contract exists.

Wait, maybe the memo is sufficient because it's a writing that indicates a contract was formed, even if it doesn't have all the terms. The key is whether it indicates that a contract exists between the parties. The memo says, "I shall take a 15 percent discount..." which implies that there's an agreement in place regarding the sale of the fire extinguishers. So perhaps it's enough.

In that case, the memo serves as a written confirmation, and since the salesperson didn't object within 10 days, the contract is enforceable, and the statute of frauds defense fails.

So looking at the options, option E says the defense is not valid because the man's memo is a written contract under UCC. But wait, the memo isn't signed by both parties. It's only the man's writing. So perhaps it's not a written contract, but a written confirmation.

Alternatively, perhaps the memo is not a contract because it's not signed by the salesperson. So it's a written confirmation, not a contract. Under UCC 2-201(2), a written confirmation between merchants is sufficient unless objected to within 10 days. So the memo would satisfy the statute of frauds because it's a written confirmation, and the salesperson didn't object in time.

So, the salesperson's defense is invalid because the memo serves as a sufficient written confirmation, making the contract enforceable despite the statute of frauds.

Looking at the options, option E says the memo is a written contract. But a written confirmation isn't a contract itself; it's just evidence of the oral contract. So perhaps option E is incorrect.

Option G says the defense is invalid because the statute of frauds isn't applicable between merchants. But that's not correct because the statute of frauds still applies, but there's an exception for written confirmations between merchants.

Option H says the defense is invalid because the man accepted before the salesperson terminated. But that's about termination, not the statute of frauds.

Option D says the defense is invalid because the salesperson breached by not delivering. But that's about liability, not the initial defense of the statute of frauds.

So, the correct reasoning is that the memo serves as a written confirmation under UCC 2-201(2), making the oral contract enforceable because the salesperson didn't object within 10 days. Therefore, the statute of frauds defense is invalid.

Looking at the options:

E: Incorrect, because the memo isn't a written contract, but a confirmation.

G: Incorrect, because the statute applies, but the exception applies.

H: Not directly about the statute of frauds.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The memo is a written confirmation, so it falls under the exception in 2-201(2). So the contract is enforceable, making the salesperson's defense invalid. So the correct answer is either E or G.

Wait, no. Option G says the statute of frauds isn't applicable between merchants. But that's not correct because the statute still applies, but with exceptions.

Option E says the memo is a written contract. But the memo isn't a contract, it's a confirmation of an oral contract. So the memo allows the oral contract to be enforceable despite the statute of frauds.

So which option states that the defense is invalid because of the written confirmation? Let's look at the options again.

Option E: The defense is not valid because the man's memo is considered a written contract under UCC. But the memo isn't a contract, it's a confirmation. So E might not be accurate.

Option H: The defense is invalid because the man accepted before termination. But that's about termination, not the statute.

Option G: Not valid because the statute of frauds isn't applicable between merchants. No, that's incorrect because the statute applies but has exceptions.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's check the options again.

Option E is about the memo being a written contract. But the memo isn't a contract; it's a confirmation. So E is incorrect.

Option G is about the statute of frauds not applying between merchants, which is incorrect. The statute applies, but there are exceptions.

Wait, so the correct reason is that the memo serves as a written confirmation under UCC 2-201(2), making the oral contract enforceable. So the salesperson's defense is invalid.

Looking at the options, option E says the memo is a written contract, which may not be accurate. So perhaps the correct answer is option E, but I'm not fully confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the memo doesn't satisfy the statute of frauds because it's not signed. So, the salesperson's defense is valid.

Wait, the memo is from the man, so it's signed by him, but the salesperson didn't sign it. However, under UCC 2-201(2), the written confirmation doesn't need to be signed by both parties. Just that one merchant sends a written confirmation to the other, and if the recipient doesn't object within 10 days, it's sufficient.

So the memo would make the oral contract enforceable, so the salesperson's defense fails.

So the correct answer would be that the memo serves as a written confirmation, so the statute of frauds doesn't apply. Looking at the options, the only one that addresses this is option E, but I'm unsure because E says "written contract" instead of "written confirmation."

Alternatively, perhaps the memo isn't sufficient because it doesn't include all the necessary terms. So the salesperson's defense is valid.

Wait, the memo doesn't state the quantity, price, or delivery terms. So it's insufficient on its own. Therefore, the memo doesn't satisfy the statute of frauds, so the salesperson's defense is valid.

So then, the correct answer would be option C: The salesperson's defense is valid because the man's memo was not sufficient to indicate that a contract was formed.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to outline:

1. The contract is for $35,000, so over $500. Statute of frauds applies.

2. The contract was oral, so normally unenforceable unless an exception applies.

3. The man sent a memo that could be a written confirmation.

4. Under UCC 2-201(2), between merchants, a written confirmation is enough unless objected within 10 days.

5. The memo was sent on March 17, received March 20. Salesperson objected on April 1, which is 12 days later. So objection was too late.

6. Therefore, the memo serves as a written confirmation, making the oral contract enforceable. So the salesperson's defense is invalid.

So the memo is sufficient as a written confirmation, so the salesperson can't use the statute of frauds defense.

Looking at the options, none of them directly state this. Let's look again:

A: About 90-day payment, irrelevant.

B: Memo inconsistent with offer. Maybe, but the memo was a modification.

C: Memo not sufficient to indicate contract formed. But if it's a written confirmation, it is sufficient.

D: Salesperson breached by not delivering. Not about statute of frauds.

E: Memo is written contract. Not exactly, but perhaps close enough.

F: Memo lacks signature. No, because under 2-201(2), the confirmation doesn't need to be signed by both.

G: Statute of frauds not applicable between merchants. No, because it's still applicable with exceptions.

H: Accepted before termination. Not relevant to statute.

I: Salesperson didn't respond. Not directly relevant.

So the only option that aligns with the memo making the contract enforceable is E, but E says it's a written contract, which might not be accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E because the memo serves to take it out of the statute of frauds.

Wait, perhaps the memo is sufficient as a written contract because it indicates the existence of a contract, even without all terms. So E would be correct.

Wait, but the memo only refers to the discount and payment term, not quantity or price. So it doesn't include all the essential terms. Therefore, it's insufficient, making the salesperson's defense valid. So option C would be correct.

So I'm torn between E and C.
