Question:

Greene is the sole shareholder of Seagull, a calendar-year S corporation. Greene's basis at the beginning of the year is $15,000.

Okay, so I have this question about S corporations and shareholder basis. Hmm, I remember that the basis is important for determining whether distributions are taxable or not, and for deducting losses. Let me try to break this down.

Greene is the sole shareholder of Seagull, an S corporation. At the beginning of the year, his basis is $15,000. The corporation reports an ordinary loss of $5,000 and has $2,000 of municipal bond interest. Then, they distributed $6,000 cash to Greene on November 1. The question is, what's Greene's basis at the end of the year?

Wait, I think I remember that for S corporations, the shareholder's basis is adjusted for items of income, loss, and distributions. Oh right, the order matters: first, you adjust for income and losses, then account for distributions.

So the starting basis is $15,000. Seagull has an ordinary loss of $5,000. Since it's an S corporation, Greene can deduct his share of that loss, which would reduce his basis. But wait, the loss is limited to the basis. So the loss is $5,000, and his basis is 15k, so he can deduct the full $5k loss, right? That would reduce his basis by $5k to $10k.

But wait, there's also the municipal bond interest. Oh, right, in S corporations, certain items like municipal interest are treated as separately stated items and increase the shareholder's basis. So the $2,000 of municipal bond interest would add to his basis. So after the loss and the interest, basis would be 15,000 - 5,000 + 2,000. Let me calculate that: 15k -5k is 10k, plus 2k is 12k. So basis is now 12k before considering distributions.

Then, the corporation distributed $6,000 to Greene. Distributions decrease the shareholder's basis. So, from 12k, subtract 6k, which brings it down to 6k. Wait, but can you distribute more than the basis? Because if the basis is 12k, and you distribute 6k, that's allowed. So the basis after distribution is 6k. 

Wait, but wait another second. I think I might have mixed something up. The order is important. The loss reduces basis, but the municipal interest increases it. So let me make sure I'm doing this right.

Starting basis: 15,000.

First, the ordinary loss of 5,000: subtract that from basis. 15k -5k = 10k.

Then, add the municipal bond interest: 10k + 2k = 12k.

Then, subtract the distribution: 12k -6k =6k.

So the basis at the end of the year is 6,000.

Looking at the options, option A is $6,000, so the answer should be A.

Wait, but wait again. Oh, no! Wait, I think I made a mistake. Because in S corporations, the order is: first, you adjust for all income and loss items, then you subtract distributions, but only up to the basis after those adjustments. But wait, let me think again.

Another approach: The shareholder's basis is adjusted for all items of income, gain, loss, deduction first, and then distributions are taken from that. So the steps are:

Start with $15k.

Add the municipal interest: 15k +2k =17k.

Subtract the ordinary loss: 17k -5k=12k.

Then, subtract the distribution of 6k: 12k -6k=6k.

So yes, same result, 6k.

So the answer would be A:6,000.

Greene's basis in Seagull at the end of the year is calculated as follows:

1. **Starting Basis**: Greene's initial basis is $15,000.
2. **Adjust for Ordinary Loss**: The S corporation reports an ordinary loss of $5,000, which reduces Greene's basis.  
   $15,000 - $5,000 = $10,000.
3. **Adjust for Municipal Bond Interest**: Municipal bond interest is a separately stated item that increases the shareholder's basis.  
   $10,000 + $2,000 = $12,000.
4. **Adjust for Distribution**: The corporation distributes $6,000 to Greene, which decreases his basis.  
   $12,000 - $6,000 = $6,000.

Thus, Greene's basis in Seagull at the end of the year is $6,000.
