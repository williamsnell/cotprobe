Okay, so I have this question about what a command economy is, and I need to figure it out. I'm a bit rusty on my economics, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that economies are usually categorized into different types based on how resources are allocated. The main ones I know are traditional, market, command, and mixed economies. 

So, a command economy... I think it's where the government plays a major role. Like, they decide what to produce, how much, and how resources are used. It's the opposite of a market economy where businesses and individuals make those decisions based on supply and demand.

Looking at the options:

Option A says resources are allocated by voting among citizens. That sounds more like a direct democracy approach, but I don't think that's a command economy. I think command economies are more centralized, not based on voting by all citizens.

Option B is market demand. Wait, no, that's a market economy, not command. So B isn't right.

Option C says the government controls key industries and the rest is market-driven. That sounds more like a mixed economy. For example, many countries have some government involvement in certain sectors but mostly let the market run. So C isn't the command economy.

Option D talks about local governments with no central authority. That doesn't fit because command economies are usually very centralized, not decentralized. So D is probably not correct.

Option E is about distributing resources evenly. That's more like socialism or equality-focused systems, but not specifically command economies. Command economies focus on government control, not necessarily equal distribution.

Option F says resources are allocated by a central planning authority. That rings a bell. I remember the Soviet Union was a classic example of a command economy where the central government made all the decisions. So F sounds correct.

Option G mentions tradition and culture. That's the traditional economy, where customs and practices determine resource allocation. So G is out.

Option H is based on individual wealth. That's more like a capitalist approach, where those with more wealth have more influence, but it's not a command economy.

Option I talks about non-profits determining prices and production. I'm not sure about that. Maybe some non-profits play a role in certain sectors, but it's not the defining feature of a command economy.

Option J is competition among private companies. That's definitely a market economy, so J isn't right.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be F because a command economy relies on central planning by the government to allocate resources.

A command economy is characterized by a centralized system where the government or a central planning authority makes decisions about the allocation of resources, production, and distribution. This is distinct from market economies, where decisions are driven by supply and demand, or mixed economies, where both government and market mechanisms play a role.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, C, D, E, G, H, I, J** do not align with the definition of a command economy.  
- **F** correctly identifies that resources are allocated according to the commands of a central planning authority, which is the hallmark of a command economy.

Answer: F
