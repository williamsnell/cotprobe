Okay, so I've got this problem here about Mr. Donald and his investments. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Alright, the question is asking for the rate of return on his investment for the year. Hmm, I remember that the rate of return is usually calculated by dividing the total return by the total investment.

So, first, I think I need to find the total dividends he received. He got four payments: $48, $64, $82.50, and $90. I should add those up. Let me do that. 

48 plus 64 is 112. Then adding 82.50 makes it 194.50. And then adding 90 brings it to 284.50. So his total dividends for the year are $284.50.

Wait, no, let me check that again. 48 + 64 is definitely 112. 112 plus 82.50 is 194.50. Then adding 90: 194.50 + 90 is 284.50. Yep, that's correct.

Now, his total investment was $12,450. The rate of return (ROR) is the total dividends divided by the total investment. So that would be 284.50 divided by 12,450.

Let me calculate that. Hmm, 284.50 ÷ 12,450. Let me see. Maybe I can write it out. 284.50 divided by 12,450. Alternatively, I can think of it as 284.5 / 12450.

Wait, maybe I can simplify this by moving the decimal. Let's see: 284.5 ÷ 12,450 is the same as 284.5 / 12450. Let me try to compute this.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of percentages. So the formula for ROR is (Dividends / Investment) * 100 to get a percentage.

So, 284.50 ÷ 12450 = ?

Let me do the division step by step. 12450 goes into 284.50 how many times? Well, 12450 x 0.02 is 249. 0.02 would be 249, which is less than 284.50. The difference is 35.5 (284.50 - 249 = 35.5). Now, 12450 x 0.002 is 24.90. So 0.02 + 0.002 = 0.022, which gives 249 + 24.9 = 273.9. Wait, but 273.9 is less than 284.50. So we have 284.50 - 273.9 = 10.6 remaining.

So, 0.022 gives us 273.9. Now, 10.6 ÷ 12450. Let's see, 10.6 / 12450. That would be approximately 0.00085. So adding that to 0.022 gives 0.02285.

Wait, but I might be getting a bit confused here. Maybe it's easier to use a calculator approach mentally. Alternatively, using fractions.

Another approach: 284.5 / 12,450. Let's divide numerator and denominator by, say, 5 to simplify. 284.5 ÷5 is 56.9, and 12,450 ÷5 is 2,490.

So now it's 56.9 / 2490. Hmm, still not straightforward. Perhaps I can multiply numerator and denominator by 10 to make it 569 / 24,900. Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, think of it as 28450 / 1245000, which would be moving both decimals two places. Wait, that's not right. Wait, 284.5 is the same as 28450 cents, and 12450 is 12450 dollars, which is 1,245,000 cents. So 28450 / 1,245,000. Let me compute that.

28450 ÷ 1,245,000. Let me see, 1,245,000 × 0.0229 is approximately 28455. So that's very close to 28450. So that would be approximately 0.0229, which is 2.29%.

Wait, 0.0229 is 2.29%. The question asks for the nearest 1/10 percent, so that would be 2.3%. Looking at the options, option G is 2.3%. But wait, let me double-check my calculation because I might have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 284.5 ÷ 12450.

Let me try to compute this division more accurately.

I can write it as 284.5 ÷ 12450 = ?

Let me convert this into a fraction: 284.5 / 12450.

I can divide numerator and denominator by 5. So 284.5 ÷5 = 56.9; 12450 ÷5=2490.

So now it's 56.9 / 2490.

Hmm, perhaps I can approximate this. Let me see, 2490 × 0.02 is 49.8. Subtracting that from 56.9 gives 56.9 -49.8 =7.1.

Now, 7.1 / 2490 is approximately 0.00285 (since 2490 × 0.002 =4.98; 0.0028 would be approx 6.972). So adding that to 0.02 gives 0.02285, which is 2.285% approximately.

Rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent, that would be 2.3%. So the answer would be G:2.3%.

Wait, but let me check another way. Let's compute 12450 × 0.023 = ?

12450 × 0.02 = 249.

12450 × 0.003 = 37.35.

So 249 + 37.35 = 286.35. But Mr. Donald's dividends are 284.50, which is slightly less than 286.35.

So 0.023 would give 286.35, which is higher than 284.50. So the actual rate is a bit less than 2.3%. So perhaps it's 2.28% or something, which would round to 2.3%.

But wait, maybe I should compute it more precisely.

Alternatively, let's compute 284.5 / 12450.

Let me set it up as a division: 284.5 ÷ 12450.

Since 12450 is larger than 284.5, the result will be less than 1. Let's add a decimal point and zeros to 284.5 to continue the division.

So 284.5 ÷ 12450.

We can write it as 284.500000...

12450 goes into 2845 two times (2 × 12450 = 24900). Subtract 24900 from 28450, which gives 3550.

Bring down the next 0, making it 35500.

12450 goes into 35500 two times (2 × 12450 = 24900). Subtract, get 10600.

Bring down a zero, making it 106000.

12450 goes into 106000 eight times (8 ×12450=99400? Wait, 12450 × 8: 12,450 ×8 = 99,600. So subtract 99,600 from 106,000, which leaves 6,400.

Bring down a zero, making it 64,000.

12450 goes into 64,000 five times (5×12450=62,250). Subtract, get 1,750.

Bring down a zero, making it 17,500.

12450 goes into 17,500 once (1×12450=12,450). Subtract, leaves 5,050.

Bring down a zero, making it 50,500.

12450 goes into 50,500 four times (4×12450=49,800). Subtract, leaves 700.

At this point, I can see the pattern, but let me tally up the results so far.

We have 0.0228... So 0.0228 approximately.

Wait, the division steps I took: first 2, then 2, then 8, then 5, etc. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the steps.

Wait, let me retrace the division steps.

Wait, I think I messed up the initial setup. Wait, 284.5 ÷ 12450 is the same as 0. (since 12450 >284.5). So we can write it as 0. and then proceed.

Let me adjust:

We can write 284.5 ÷ 12450 as 0.____%.

So, 12450 goes into 2845 how many times? Wait, 12450 × 0.02 is 249. So 0.02 times is 249. But wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps using decimal places would help.

Wait, perhaps I should use a different approach. Let me compute 284.5 ÷ 12450.

Dividing both numerator and denominator by 5 gives 56.9 / 2490.

So, 56.9 ÷ 2490.

Now, 2490 × 0.02 = 49.8.

56.9 -49.8 =7.1.

7.1 ÷ 2490 is approximately 0.002852 (because 2490 × 0.0028 = 6.972, and 2490 × 0.00285 = approx 7.0965, which is just over 7.1).

So adding that to 0.02 gives 0.02285.

So 0.02285 is the decimal, which is 2.285% approximately. So to the nearest tenth of a percent, that's 2.3%.

So the answer should be G: 2.3%.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are:

A: 2.8% 

B:2.6% 

C:3.0% 

D:2.0% 

E:3.2% 

F:1.5% 

G:2.3% 

H:1.8% 

I:3.7% 

J:4.5%

So yes, G is 2.3%, which matches our calculation.

To determine the rate of return on Mr. Donald's investment, we first calculate the total dividends received during the year. The dividends are $48, $64, $82.50, and $90. Adding these together:

\[
48 + 64 + 82.50 + 90 = 284.50
\]

Thus, the total dividends amount to **$284.50**.

Next, the rate of return (ROR) is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{ROR} = \left( \frac{\text{Total Dividends}}{\text{Total Investment}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{ROR} = \left( \frac{284.50}{12450} \right) \times 100
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\frac{284.50}{12450} \approx 0.02285
\]

Converting this to a percentage:

\[
0.02285 \times 100 \approx 2.285\%
\]

Rounding to the nearest tenth of a percent gives:

\[
2.3\%
\]

From the given options, the closest match is **G: 2.3%**.

Answer: G
