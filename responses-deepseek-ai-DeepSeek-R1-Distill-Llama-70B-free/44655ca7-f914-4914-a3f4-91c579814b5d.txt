Question:

The procedure below is intended to display the index in a list of unique names (nameList) where a particular name (targetName) is found. lf targetName is not found in nameList, the code should display 0.
 PROCEDURE FindName (nameList, targetName)
 {
  index ← 0
  FOR EACH name IN nameList
  {
   index ← index + 1
   IF (name = targetName)
   {
   foundIndex ← index
   }
   ELSE
   {
   foundIndex ← 0
   }
  }
  DISPLAY (foundIndex)
 }
 Which of the following procedure calls can be used to demonstrate that the procedure does NOT Work as intended?

Options:

A: FindName (["Andrea", "Ben", "Chris", "Diane", "Eva", "Frank", "Grace", "Hannah", "Igor"], "Igor" )
B: FindName (["Andrea", "Ben", "Chris", "Diane"], "Diane" )
C: FindName (["Andrea", "Ben", "Chris", "Diane", "Eva", "Frank"], "Frank" )
D: FindName (["Andrea", "Ben"], "Ben" )
E: FindName (["Andrea", "Chris", "Diane"], "Ben")
F: FindName (["Andrea", "Ben" ], "Diane" )
G: FindName (["Andrea", "Ben", "Chris"], "Ben")
H: FindName (["Andrea", "Ben", "Chris", "Diane", "Eva"], "Eva" )
I: FindName (["Andrea", "Ben", "Chris", "Diane", "Eva", "Frank", "Grace", "Hannah"], "Hannah" )
J: FindName (["Andrea", "Ben", "Chris", "Diane", "Eva", "Frank", "Grace"], "Grace" )

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which procedure call shows that the FindName procedure doesn't work as intended. Let me start by understanding what the procedure is supposed to do.

From the problem statement, the procedure is supposed to find the index of a targetName in a list of unique names. If the target is found, it returns the index; if not, it returns 0. But wait, wait, the way the procedure is written might not actually do that correctly. Let me look at the code again.

The procedure initializes index to 0. Then, for each name in the list, it increments index by 1. So the first name is index 1, not 0. Then, if the name matches targetName, foundIndex is set to index. Otherwise, it sets foundIndex to 0. After checking all names, it displays foundIndex.

Wait, but the problem is that in each iteration of the loop, the foundIndex is being set. Because if the target is found early, but then later names don't match, foundIndex gets reset to 0. So the procedure only returns the index if the target is the last element in the list. Otherwise, if the target is somewhere in the middle, the next iterations will overwrite foundIndex to 0, unless another name matches. Oh, but the list is supposed to have unique names, so each name appears only once.

Wait, but the loop goes through each name. Suppose the target is at position 3. The loop runs, and when it hits the target, foundIndex becomes 3. Then, the loop continues to the next names. Since none of them match, foundIndex is set to 0 each time. So after processing all names, foundIndex will be 0, even though the target was found earlier. That's a problem.

So the procedure doesn't correctly return the index of the target. It only returns the correct index if the target is the last element in the list. Otherwise, it will return 0, because after the last iteration (which is not the target), foundIndex is set to 0.

So the procedure is flawed. It should instead break out of the loop once it finds the target, because otherwise, any subsequent names will reset foundIndex.

Now, the question is, which of the procedure calls will demonstrate that it doesn't work as intended. That would be a case where the target exists in the list but is not the last element. Because for such a case, the procedure would return 0 instead of the correct index.

Let me look at the options.

Option A: Target is "Igor" which is the last element in a list of 9 names. So the procedure would find it on the last iteration, and foundIndex would be 9. So this would work as intended.

Option B: Target is "Diane", which is the 4th element (index 4). The list has 4 names, so the last element is "Diane". So the procedure would correctly return 4. So this works as intended.

Option C: Target is "Frank", which is the 6th element in a 6-name list. So it's the last element. Procedure returns 6. Correct.

Option D: Target is "Ben", which is the 2nd element. The list has 2 elements, so Ben is the last one. So procedure returns 2. Correct.

Option E: Target is "Ben", which isn't present in a list of ["Andrea", "Chris", "Diane"]. So the procedure should return 0. Let's see what the code does. Each name is checked, none match, so foundIndex is 0 after each loop. So it correctly returns 0. So this works as intended because target is not present.

Option F: Target is "Diane", not present. The list is ["Andrea", "Ben"], so no match. So procedure returns 0. Correct.

Option G: Target is "Ben", which is the second element in a 3-element list. So Ben is at index 2. But the list has three elements: after Ben comes Chris. So let's walk through the code.

Loop starts with index 0.

First name is Andrea: index increments to 1. Doesn't match Ben, so foundIndex is 0.

Second name is Ben: index is 2. Matches, so foundIndex is 2.

Third name is Chris: index increments to 3. Doesn't match, so foundIndex is 0.

So after the loop, foundIndex is 0. So the procedure returns 0 even though Ben was found at index 2. So this demonstrates that the procedure doesn't work as intended because it should return 2, but returns 0.

Wait, but let me check. Because in the loop, for each name, including the last one, the code will process. So in this case, when the target is the second name, the third name is processed, which doesn't match, so foundIndex is 0. So the final output is 0. That's wrong because the target exists in the list. So this call would show the procedure doesn't work.

Option H: Target is "Eva", which is the 5th element in a 5-element list. So it's the last element. So procedure returns 5, correct.

Option I: Target is "Hannah", which is the 8th element in an 8-element list. So it's the last. So correct.

Option J: Target is "Grace", which is the 7th element in a 7-element list. So correct.

So the procedure fails when the target is found but is not the last element in the list. The only option where this happens is option G: FindName(["Andrea", "Ben", "Chris"], "Ben").

So the correct answer is option G because the target is present but not last, leading the procedure to return 0 instead of 2.

To determine which procedure call demonstrates that the `FindName` procedure does not work as intended, we analyze the procedure's behavior. The procedure is designed to return the index of `targetName` in `nameList` if found, or `0` if not found. However, the procedure has a flaw: it resets `foundIndex` to `0` for every name that does not match `targetName`, even after `targetName` has been found. This means that if `targetName` is not the last element in the list, the procedure will incorrectly return `0` instead of the correct index.

We evaluate each option to identify a case where `targetName` is present in the list but not as the last element, causing the procedure to fail:

- **Option A**: The target "Igor" is the last element in a list of 9 names. The procedure correctly returns the index of the last element, so it works as intended.
- **Option B**: The target "Diane" is the last element in a list of 4 names. The procedure correctly returns the index of the last element, so it works as intended.
- **Option C**: The target "Frank" is the last element in a list of 6 names. The procedure correctly returns the index of the last element, so it works as intended.
- **Option D**: The target "Ben" is the last element in a list of 2 names. The procedure correctly returns the index of the last element, so it works as intended.
- **Option E**: The target "Ben" is not present in the list. The procedure correctly returns `0`, so it works as intended.
- **Option F**: The target "Diane" is not present in the list. The procedure correctly returns `0`, so it works as intended.
- **Option G**: The target "Ben" is the second element in a list of 3 names. After finding "Ben" at index `2`, the procedure processes the next name ("Chris"), which does not match, resetting `foundIndex` to `0`. Thus, the procedure incorrectly returns `0` instead of `2`, demonstrating that it does not work as intended.
- **Option H**: The target "Eva" is the last element in a list of 5 names. The procedure correctly returns the index of the last element, so it works as intended.
- **Option I**: The target "Hannah" is the last element in a list of 8 names. The procedure correctly returns the index of the last element, so it works as intended.
- **Option J**: The target "Grace" is the last element in a list of 7 names. The procedure correctly returns the index of the last element, so it works as intended.

The only procedure call that demonstrates the flaw in the `FindName` procedure is **Option G**, where the target is present but not the last element, causing the procedure to return `0` instead of the correct index.
