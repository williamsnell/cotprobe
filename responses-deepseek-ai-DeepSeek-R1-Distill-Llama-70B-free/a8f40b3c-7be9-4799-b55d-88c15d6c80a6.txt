Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of acid-base equilibria. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about finding the K_b and pK_b for the acetate ion, CH3COO^-. I remember that acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid. Oh right, because acetic acid donates a proton to become acetate. So the ionization of acetic acid is CH3COOH ⇌ H+ + CH3COO^-.

They gave me the K_a for acetic acid as 1.75 × 10^-5. And K_w is 1.00 × 10^-14. K_w is the ion product of water, which I know is equal to [H+][OH-] at 25°C.

I think the key here is the relationship between K_a and K_b for a conjugate acid-base pair. Oh yeah, the formula: K_a * K_b = K_w. So K_b is the base dissociation constant for the acetate ion acting as a base. So I can find K_b by rearranging the formula. 

So K_b = K_w / K_a. Let's plug in the numbers. K_w is 1e-14, K_a is 1.75e-5. So K_b = (1e-14) / (1.75e-5). 

Hmm, let me calculate that. 1e-14 divided by 1.75e-5. Let me write that as (1 / 1.75) * 1e-9. Because 1e-14 / 1e-5 is 1e-9. So 1 divided by 1.75 is approximately 0.5714. So 0.5714e-9 is the same as 5.714e-10. Wait, but wait—calculating 1/1.75 exactly, 1.75 is 7/4, so 1/(7/4)=4/7 ≈ 0.5714. So yeah, 5.714e-10. 

Rounded to three significant figures, since K_a is given to three sig figs. So 5.71 × 10^-10. That's K_b.

Now, pK_b is the negative logarithm of K_b. So pK_b = -log10(K_b). Let's calculate that. K_b is 5.71e-10. So log(5.71e-10) is log(5.71) + log(1e-10). Log(5.71) is around 0.755 (since log(5)=0.699, log(6)=0.778, so 5.71 is probably about 0.755). So 0.755 + (-10) = -9.245. So pK_b is 9.245. 

Wait, let me double-check that. Because log(5.71e-10) is log(5.71) + log(1e-10). Log(ab) = log a + log b. So yes, 0.755 -10 = -9.245. So the negative of that is 9.245. So pK_b is approximately 9.245.

Looking at the options, let's check option B: K_b is 5.71e-10, pK_b 9.244. That's very close. Option E says K_b is 5.71e-10, pK_b is 14 - log(5.71e-10). Wait, but 14 minus log(5.71e-10) would be 14 - (log(5.71) -10) → 24 - log(5.71). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me compute 14 - log(5.71e-10). 

Wait, log(5.71e-10) is the same as before, which is -9.244. So 14 - (-9.244) = 23.244. That can't be right. So option E's pK_b is 23.244? That doesn't match what I calculated, which was around 9.244. So option B seems correct.

Option A's K_b is 5.71e-9, which is an order of magnitude higher. That would be if I did K_b = K_a / K_w, which is wrong. So yeah, option B is the right choice.

To determine \( K_b \) and \( pK_b \) for the acetate ion \( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \), we use the relationship between the acid dissociation constant (\( K_a \)) and the base dissociation constant (\( K_b \)) for a conjugate acid-base pair:

\[
K_a \cdot K_b = K_w
\]

Here, \( K_a \) for acetic acid is given as \( 1.75 \times 10^{-5} \), and \( K_w \) (the ion product of water) is \( 1.00 \times 10^{-14} \). Rearranging the formula to solve for \( K_b \):

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
K_b = \frac{1.00 \times 10^{-14}}{1.75 \times 10^{-5}} = \frac{1}{1.75} \times 10^{-9} \approx 0.5714 \times 10^{-9} = 5.71 \times 10^{-10}
\]

Thus, \( K_b = 5.71 \times 10^{-10} \).

Next, \( pK_b \) is calculated as the negative logarithm of \( K_b \):

\[
pK_b = -\log_{10}(K_b)
\]

For \( K_b = 5.71 \times 10^{-10} \):

\[
pK_b = -\log_{10}(5.71 \times 10^{-10}) = -(\log_{10}(5.71) + \log_{10}(10^{-10}))
\]

\[
\log_{10}(5.71) \approx 0.755, \quad \log_{10}(10^{-10}) = -10
\]

\[
pK_b = -(0.755 - 10) = 9.245
\]

Thus, \( pK_b \approx 9.244 \).

Now, comparing the results with the options:

- **Option A**: \( K_b = 5.71 \times 10^{-9}, pK_b = 8.244 \) — Incorrect, as \( K_b \) is too large.
- **Option B**: \( K_b = 5.71 \times 10^{-10}, pK_b = 9.244 \) — Correct, matches the calculated values.
- **Option C**: \( K_b = 5.71 \times 10^{-11}, pK_b = 10.244 \) — Incorrect, as \( K_b \) is too small.
- **Option D**: \( K_b = 9.244, pK_b = 5.71 \times 10^{-10} \) — Incorrect, as \( K_b \) is not consistent with the calculations.
- **Option E**: \( K_b = 5.71 \times 10^{-10}, pK_b = 14 - \log(5.71 \times 10^{-10}) \) — Incorrect, as \( pK_b \) is miscalculated.
- **Option F**: \( K_b = 1.00 \times 10^{-14}, pK_b = 1.75 \times 10^{-5} \) — Incorrect, as both values are inconsistent.
- **Option G**: \( K_b = 1.75 \times 10^{-5}, pK_b = 1.00 \times 10^{-14} \) — Incorrect, as both values are inconsistent.
- **Option H**: \( K_b = 1.00 \times 10^{-9}, pK_b = 9.00 \) — Incorrect, as \( K_b \) is too large.
- **Option I**: \( K_b = 1.00 \times 10^{-13}, pK_b = 13 \) — Incorrect, as \( K_b \) is too small.
- **Option J**: \( K_b = 1.00 \times 10^{-7}, pK_b = 7 \) — Incorrect, as \( K_b \) is too large.

The correct answer is **Option B**.
