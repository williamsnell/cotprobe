Okay, so I've got this question about Erikson's psychosocial stages and how they relate to Freud's stages. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it.

The question is asking which of Erikson's stages corresponds to Freud's phallic stage in terms of age. I remember that Freud had different psychosexual stages, and Erikson built upon that with his psychosocial theory.

Freud's stages are oral, anal, phallic, latency, and genital. The phallic stage is the third one, I think, and it's around the age of 3 to 6 years old. During this stage, the primary focus is on the genitals, and the Oedipus complex comes into play. So the age group is roughly early childhood.

Now, Erikson's stages are eight in total. Let me list them out with their ages to get a better idea:

1. Basic Trust vs. Mistrust (0-1 year)
2. Autonomy vs. Shame and Doubt (1-3 years)
3. Initiative vs. Guilt (3-6 years)
4. Industry vs. Inferiority (6-12 years)
5. Identity vs. Role Confusion (12-18 years)
6. Intimacy vs. Isolation (young adulthood)
7. Generativity vs. Stagnation (middle adulthood)
8. Ego Integrity vs. Despair (old age)

So the third stage for Erikson is Initiative vs. Guilt, and the age range is 3-6 years. That seems to line up with Freud's phallic stage, which is also around the same age.

Wait, but I should double-check. Freud's phallic stage is indeed about 3-6 years. Erikson's third stage is 3-6, so that's the match. So the correct answer would be the one that lists Initiative vs. Guilt.

Looking at the options, option G is Initiative vs. Guilt. So the answer should be G.

The correct answer is G: initiative vs. guilt. 

Erikson's third stage, "initiative vs. guilt," corresponds to Freud's phallic stage, both occurring during the same age range of 3 to 6 years.

Answer: G
