Question:

Contrast the meanings of the terms "gene pool" and "genotype\textquotedblright.

Options:

A: A gene pool is the genetic makeup present in the environment, while a genotype is the genetic makeup that an organism inherits from its parents.
B: A gene pool is the set of all genes within a single organism, while a genotype refers to the genetic variations among different populations.
C: A gene pool is the genetic constitution of an individual, while a genotype is the total genetic information in a population.
D: A gene pool is the collection of genes that predict an organism's phenotype, while a genotype is the combination of alleles that an organism possesses for a single trait.
E: A genotype is the unique genetic code found within a cell, while a gene pool encompasses the various genotypes that interact within an ecosystem.
F: Genotype refers to the breeding potential of a population, while a gene pool is the set of all possible genes that can be passed down through reproduction.
G: A gene pool and genotype both refer to the genetic constitution of an individual.
H: A gene pool and genotype both refer to the total genetic information in a population.
I: A gene pool is the total genetic information in a population, while a genotype is the genetic constitution of an individual.
J: A gene pool refers to a collection of physical traits in a population, while a genotype is the specific genetic makeup responsible for one particular trait.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about genetics terms, specifically contrasting "gene pool" and "genotype". Hmm, I need to figure out what each term means and then match them to the correct option.

Let me start by recalling what I know about these terms. A genotype, I think, refers to the genetic makeup of an individual organism. Like, genotype is the specific set of genes that an organism possesses. For example, if you have genes for brown eyes or blue eyes, your genotype determines that. So genotype is about the individual's genes.

Gene pool, on the other hand, is a term I remember from population genetics. I think it refers to all the genes present in a population. So it's like the total genetic diversity available within a group of organisms. For example, in a population of deer, the gene pool would include all the different alleles for all the genes present in that population. This is important for understanding things like evolution and natural selection because the gene pool determines the potential traits that can be passed on.

Now, looking at the options. Let's go through each one.

Option A: A gene pool is the genetic makeup in the environment, while genotype is inherited from parents. Wait, the gene pool isn't in the environment. It's within the population's genes. So A doesn't seem right.

Option B: Gene pool is genes in one organism; genotype refers to variations among populations. No, that's the opposite. Genotype is individual, gene pool is population-wide.

Option C: Gene pool is individual's genes; genotype is population's. No, that's backwards again.

Option D: Gene pool predicts phenotype, genotype is alleles for a trait. Not sure, but I think gene pool isn't about predicting phenotype. It's more about all the genes available.

Option E: Genotype is in a cell; gene pool is various genotypes in an ecosystem. Hmm, genotype is individual, so E's first part is correct. Gene pool as various genotypes? Maybe. But I'm not certain. Let me hold onto that thought.

Option F: Genotype is breeding potential of population; gene pool is all possible genes. Wait, genotype is individual, not population. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Both refer to individual's genetic constitution. No, because gene pool is about the population.

Option H: Both refer to population's total genetic info. No, because genotype is individual.

Option I: Gene pool is total in population; genotype is individual's. Yes, that sounds right. Because gene pool is the collective genes in a population, genotype is the individual's genes.

Option J: Gene pool is physical traits; genotype is specific genetic makeup. No, gene pool is about genes, not physical traits. Physical traits are phenotypes.

So putting it together, the correct answer should be I. Because gene pool refers to the total genetic information in a population, and genotype refers to an individual's genetic makeup.

The correct answer is I. A gene pool refers to the total genetic information present in a population, encompassing all the genes and their variations. In contrast, a genotype refers to the specific genetic makeup of an individual organism, determining its traits.

Answer: I
