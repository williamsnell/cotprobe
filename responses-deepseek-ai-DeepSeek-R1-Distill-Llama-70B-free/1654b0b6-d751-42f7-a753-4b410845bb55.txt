Okay, so I need to find the determinant of this 3x3 matrix. Let me see. The matrix given is:

[[0, 1, 2],
 [7, 8, 3],
 [6, 5, 4]]

Hmm, I remember that the determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be calculated using the rule of Sarrus or the general method of expansion by minors. I think I'll go with the expansion method because I'm a bit more comfortable with that right now.

So the formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix is:

det(A) = a(ei − fh) − b(di − fg) + c(dh − eg)

Where the matrix is:
[ a  b  c ]
[ d  e  f ]
[ g  h  i ]

Let me assign the values from the given matrix. So:

a = 0, b = 1, c = 2
d = 7, e = 8, f = 3
g = 6, h = 5, i = 4

Plugging these into the formula:

det = 0*(8*4 - 3*5) - 1*(7*4 - 3*6) + 2*(7*5 - 8*6)

Let me compute each part step by step.

First term: 0*(something) is zero, so that's easy.

Second term: -1 times (7*4 - 3*6). Let's calculate inside the parentheses.

7*4 is 28, and 3*6 is 18. So 28-18 is 10. Multiply by -1 gives -10.

Third term: 2 times (7*5 - 8*6). Compute inside first: 7*5=35, 8*6=48. So 35-48 is -13. Multiply by 2 gives -26.

Now sum all the terms: 0 + (-10) + (-26) = -36.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, for the third term: 7*5 is 35, 8*6 is 48. 35 minus 48 is indeed -13. Multiply by 2 gives -26. Second term is (7*4=28, 3*6=18, 28-18=10, times -1 is -10). So 0 -10 is -10, plus (-26) is -36.

Looking at the options, option I is -36. So the answer should be I.

Wait, but let me see if I can compute it another way. Maybe using another method to confirm.

Alternatively, the determinant can be calculated using expansion along the first row since it has a zero, which might make it easier.

The determinant is:

0 * minor - 1 * minor + 2 * minor.

But since the first term is 0, I can ignore it. So the determinant is -1*(determinant of the minor matrix when row 1, column 2 is removed) plus 2*(determinant of minor when row 1, column 3 is removed).

The minor for the element at (1,2) is the submatrix when row 1 and column 2 are removed. So the submatrix is:

[7, 3]
[6, 4]

Determinant is (7*4) - (3*6) = 28-18=10. So the second term is -1 * 10 = -10.

The minor for (1,3) is:

[7, 8]
[6, 5]

Determinant is (7*5) - (8*6) = 35-48= -13. Multiply by 2 gives -26.

Adding up: -10 + (-26) = -36. Same result. So I'm confident the answer is -36, which is option I.

The determinant of the matrix [[0, 1, 2], [7, 8, 3], [6, 5, 4]] is calculated using the expansion method for a 3x3 matrix:

\[
\text{det}(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)
\]

Assigning the values from the matrix:
- \(a = 0\), \(b = 1\), \(c = 2\)
- \(d = 7\), \(e = 8\), \(f = 3\)
- \(g = 6\), \(h = 5\), \(i = 4\)

Substituting into the formula:
\[
\text{det} = 0(8 \cdot 4 - 3 \cdot 5) - 1(7 \cdot 4 - 3 \cdot 6) + 2(7 \cdot 5 - 8 \cdot 6)
\]

Calculating each term:
1. First term: \(0 \cdot (32 - 15) = 0\)
2. Second term: \(-1 \cdot (28 - 18) = -1 \cdot 10 = -10\)
3. Third term: \(2 \cdot (35 - 48) = 2 \cdot (-13) = -26\)

Adding all terms:
\[
0 - 10 - 26 = -36
\]

Thus, the determinant of the matrix is \(-36\), which corresponds to option **I**.
