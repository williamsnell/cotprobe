Okay, so I need to figure out this psychology question about reinforcement schedules. Let's see... The question is about Soledad answering every email her friend sends. I remember that reinforcement schedules are about how often a behavior is reinforced.

First, I think about the different types of schedules. There's continuous reinforcement, where every response is reinforced. That's probably the one here because Soledad answers every email. So each time her friend sends an email, she gets a reply, which is like a reinforcement.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact terms. Let me recap. Continuous reinforcement is when every correct behavior is rewarded. Like, if you press a lever and get a treat every time, that's continuous. So in this case, every email sent by the friend is answered, meaning every action (sending an email) is followed by a response. So the friend's behavior of sending emails is reinforced every time, which would make the schedule continuous.

Looking at the options, option B is continuous. So the answer should be B, right? But wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing up fixed ratio or something else. Fixed ratio is when reinforcement is given after a set number of responses, like every 5th email. But here, it's every email, so that's not fixed ratio.

Variable ratio would be unpredictable, like gambling. So that's not it either. Fixed interval is based on time, like every 10 minutes, which also doesn't fit. So yeah, I'm pretty confident it's continuous reinforcement, so option B.

The question asks about the reinforcement schedule Soledad follows by answering every email her friend sends. Continuous reinforcement is when every response is reinforced, such as answering every email. This matches the scenario, making the correct answer:

B: continuous

Answer: B
