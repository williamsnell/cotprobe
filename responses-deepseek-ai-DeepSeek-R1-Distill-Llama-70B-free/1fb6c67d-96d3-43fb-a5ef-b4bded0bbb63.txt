Okay, so I have this chemistry question here about solubility. Hmm, let me think. The question is asking about where a solid MgCl2 would be most soluble. The options are various aqueous solutions. 

I remember that solubility rules are key here. MgCl2 is a salt, right? So when it dissolves, it dissociates into Mg²+ and Cl⁻ ions. So the solubility depends on the solution it's being dissolved in.

Wait, the solubility rules say that most chloride salts are soluble except for some like AgCl, PbCl, and maybe BaCl? But wait, no, BaCl is soluble. So MgCl2 itself is probably soluble in water. But when you put it in a solution that already has a common ion, that might affect solubility. Oh, right, the common ion effect! If the solution already has ions that MgCl2 would release when dissolved, it would make it less soluble. So if the solution has Cl⁻ or Mg²+, that would decrease solubility.

But wait, the question is about where it's most soluble. So we're looking for a solution where the ions from MgCl2 don't cause a common ion effect. Or maybe the opposite: if the solution has ions that when combined with MgCl2's ions form a more soluble compound. Or perhaps a solution that provides a different ion that could form a precipitate?

Wait, no, because if the solution has ions that form a precipitate with either Mg²+ or Cl⁻, then MgCl2 would be less soluble there. Because adding those ions would shift the solubility equilibrium. So for example, if the solution has NaOH, which provides OH⁻ ions. Mg²+ and OH⁻ can form Mg(OH)₂, which is a precipitate. So in NaOH solution, adding MgCl2 would cause Mg(OH)₂ to precipitate, making MgCl2 less soluble. So that's bad for solubility.

Looking at the options:

Option A: AlCl3(aq) — this gives Al³+ and Cl⁻. So Cl⁻ is a common ion. Adding more Cl⁻ would decrease MgCl2's solubility.

Option B: CBr4(aq) — Wait, CBr4 is carbon tetra bromide. Is that even soluble in water? Wait, no. Wait, CBr4 is a non-polar solvent, so maybe it's not very water-soluble. So if the solution is aqueous, perhaps it's a different scenario. Or maybe it's a typo and they meant something else. Alternatively, maybe the solution is a non-aqueous solvent, but the question says aqueous. Hmm, maybe I should think again. Wait, CBr4 is not very soluble in water, so perhaps the solution is a mixture, but I'm not sure. Maybe this option doesn't contribute ions that affect MgCl2's solubility.

Option C: NaOH(aq) — as I thought before, OH⁻ would react with Mg²+ to form Mg(OH)₂ precipitate. So MgCl2 would be less soluble here.

Option D: HCl(aq) — HCl is a strong acid, so it provides H+ and Cl⁻. Cl⁻ is a common ion, so adding HCl would decrease the solubility of MgCl2. So in HCl solution, MgCl2 would be less soluble.

Option E: LiOH(aq) — LiOH would dissociate into Li+ and OH⁻. The OH⁻ would again react with Mg²+ to form Mg(OH)₂, so same as NaOH. So MgCl2 would precipitate, making it less soluble.

Option F: CH3COOH(aq) — Acetic acid is a weak acid. It dissociates into CH3COO⁻ and H+. If MgCl2 dissolves, the CH3COO⁻ might form a complex with Mg²+? Or perhaps the acetate ion doesn't react. Wait, acetate is a weak base. I'm not sure. Alternatively, since acetic acid is a weak acid, it won't release as many H+ as a strong acid, but I'm not sure how that affects MgCl2 solubility. Maybe the acetate doesn't form a precipitate with Mg²+. So perhaps the solubility of MgCl2 is higher here than in other solutions because there's no common ion and no precipitation.

Option G: NaCl(aq) — NaCl gives Na+ and Cl⁻. Cl⁻ is a common ion with MgCl2, so adding more Cl⁻ would decrease solubility. So MgCl2 would be less soluble here.

Option H: MgCl2(aq) — Well, that's the same solution. So the solubility would be minimal because of the common ion effect.

Option I: Mg(NO3)2(aq) — Mg(NO3)2 dissociates into Mg²+ and NO3⁻. Mg²+ is a common ion with MgCl2. So adding more Mg²+ would decrease the solubility of MgCl2. So in this solution, MgCl2 would be less soluble.

So looking at all options, which solution would make MgCl2 more soluble? The ideal solution is one where the ions don't cause a common ion effect and don't form precipitates.

Wait, but wait. If the solution has ions that could form a compound with either Mg²+ or Cl⁻, but that compound is more soluble, that might actually increase solubility. Or perhaps the solution is such that when MgCl2 dissolves, it's more soluble because of other factors.

Wait, let's think about each option again.

Option B: CBr4. If CBr4 is in aqueous solution, perhaps it's acting as a non-polar solvent. Wait, but the solution is aqueous. If the solution has a high concentration of a non-polar solvent, maybe it's a different situation. Or perhaps CBr4 is a liquid and the solution is a mix. Hmm, I'm not too sure about this. But maybe in an aqueous solution, CBr4 isn't very soluble, so perhaps option B doesn't contribute any ions that would affect MgCl2's solubility. So in this case, MgCl2 would dissolve more because there's no common ion effect. But wait, CBr4 is a covalent compound and doesn't dissociate into ions in water, right? So the solution would be mostly water with some CBr4 molecules. So the MgCl2 would dissolve into Mg²+ and Cl⁻, but since the solution doesn't have any of those ions, the solubility would be higher. Because there's no common ion effect.

But wait, earlier I thought about HCl and NaCl having Cl⁻, which would lower solubility. So in a solution without Cl⁻ or Mg²+, the solubility of MgCl2 would be higher.

But which options have neither Cl⁻ nor Mg²+?

Looking at the options:

Option C: NaOH → Na+ and OH⁻. No Cl⁻ or Mg²+.

Option E: LiOH → Li+ and OH⁻. No Cl⁻ or Mg²+.

Option F: CH3COOH → CH3COO⁻ and H+. No Cl⁻ or Mg²+.

Option B: CBr4 → doesn't dissociate, so no ions.

So in these cases, the solution doesn't have Cl⁻ or Mg²+, so the solubility of MgCl2 would be higher.

But wait, in options C and E, the solution has OH⁻. When MgCl2 dissolves, it produces Mg²+ which reacts with OH⁻ to form Mg(OH)₂ precipitate. So the solubility would be low because the Mg²+ would precipitate out. So in these cases, MgCl2 is not very soluble.

In option F: CH3COOH. It's a weak acid. When MgCl2 dissolves, it gives Mg²+ and Cl⁻. The acetate ion (CH3COO⁻) is a weak base and might react with Mg²+? Or perhaps form a complex. I'm not too sure. Alternatively, maybe the solution is acidic, and Mg(OH)₂ doesn't precipitate as much because the solution is acidic. Wait, but Mg(OH)₂ is more likely to precipitate in basic solutions. In an acidic solution, the OH⁻ is low, so Mg²+ would stay in solution. So in acetic acid, which is a weak acid, the pH is lower, so OH⁻ is low. So Mg(OH)₂ won't precipitate. So MgCl2 would be more soluble in this solution.

But wait, let's think about what happens when you add MgCl2 to acetic acid. MgCl2 is a salt of a strong acid (HCl) and a weak base (Mg(OH)₂). So in an acidic solution, the solubility might increase because the acid can react with any hydroxide ions, making the solution more acidic and preventing precipitation of Mg(OH)₂.

Wait, but in this case, the solution is CH3COOH, which doesn't have OH⁻. So when MgCl2 dissolves, the Mg²+ and Cl⁻ go into solution. Since the solution is acidic, there's not much OH⁻, so Mg²+ doesn't form a precipitate. So the solubility should be higher here than in neutral water? Or maybe compared to solutions where ions cause precipitation.

Wait, but another thought: if the solution is of a weak acid, does that affect the solubility? For slightly soluble salts, like MgCO3, the solubility increases in acidic solutions because H+ reacts with CO3^2- to form CO2 and H2O. But MgCl2 is a soluble salt. So in an acidic solution, does it become more or less soluble?

Wait, no, because MgCl2 is already soluble. So maybe the solubility isn't significantly affected by the acidity in this case. But perhaps in the case where the solution doesn't introduce any ions that would cause precipitation or a common ion effect, the solubility is higher.

So considering the options again, which solution doesn't have Cl⁻ or Mg²+ and doesn't cause precipitation.

Option B is CBr4, which doesn't have Cl⁻ or Mg²+. So MgCl2's solubility would be higher here because no common ion effect. But wait, CBr4 is a non-polar solvent, but the solution is aqueous. So maybe it's a two-phase system, but the question says the solution is aqueous, so perhaps the CBr4 is dissolved as much as possible. But in that case, does it affect the solubility of MgCl2? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps in a solution of CBr4, which is itself a solvent, but the question specifies that the solutions are aqueous, so maybe CBr4 is just a solute in water. But CBr4 isn't very soluble in water, so perhaps the solution is not very concentrated. So option B may not be the best.

Looking at option I: Mg(NO3)2. It's a solution with Mg²+, which would cause a common ion effect, making MgCl2 less soluble. So that's bad.

Option A: AlCl3. High Cl⁻, so common ion effect. Bad.

So between options B, C, E, F. Wait, C and E are basic solutions, which cause precipitation of Mg(OH)₂. So MgCl2 would be less soluble there.

So the options left are B and F.

In option F, CH3COOH is a weak acid. So the solution is slightly acidic. MgCl2 is soluble in water, and in an acidic solution, there's no precipitation because OH⁻ is low. So MgCl2 would dissolve well in this solution. So the solubility would be higher here compared to other options where precipitation occurs or where common ion effect happens.

Wait, but I'm trying to pick the solution where MgCl2 is most soluble. So the solution that doesn't introduce any ions that would cause precipitation or a common ion effect. So the most soluble would be in a solution where it doesn't have common ions and doesn't cause precipitation.

So looking back, option I has Mg²+, which is a common ion. So MgCl2 would be less soluble there.

Option G has NaCl, which adds Cl⁻, common ion. So solubility lower.

Option D is HCl, which adds Cl⁻, same as above.

Option A adds Cl⁻.

So the best options are B, F.

In option B, the solution is CBr4, which doesn't contribute any ions. So MgCl2 would be more soluble here.

Wait, but wait. If the solution doesn't have any ions, then the solubility of MgCl2 would be higher than in solutions that have ions. Because in pure water, solubility is a certain value, but when you add ions (like in the other options), solubility decreases due to common ion effect or precipitation.

But wait, the question is about which solution among the given options MgCl2 would be most soluble. So among the options, the one that doesn't have any of the ions that MgCl2 dissociates into, and doesn't cause precipitation.

So among the options, option F is CH3COOH. Since it's a weak acid, would that affect solubility? Let's think. MgCl2 is a neutral salt. In an acidic solution, does that affect the solubility of MgCl2? For most salts, if the solution is acidic, it can affect solubility if the salt is of a weak acid or weak base. MgCl2 is the salt of a strong acid (HCl) and a weak base (Mg(OH)₂). So in an acidic solution, the solubility of MgCl2 might increase because the acid could react with any Mg(OH)₂ that forms, shifting the equilibrium.

Wait, but wait. If you have a solution where the pH is low, that is, in an acidic solution, the solubility of a metal hydroxide would increase because the H+ ions react with OH- to form water, making the solution more acidic. But MgCl2 is a soluble salt; when it dissolves, it dissociates into Mg²+ and Cl⁻. If the solution is acidic, does that help in keeping Mg²+ in solution?

Ah, wait. If you have a solution where Mg²+ might form a hydroxide, like in neutral or basic solutions, adding acid would prevent that. So in an acidic solution, any Mg(OH)₂ that might form would dissolve because H+ would react with OH- to form water.

So in CH3COOH solution, which is weakly acidic, the MgCl2 might be more soluble than in neutral water because any Mg(OH)₂ that starts to form would dissolve in the acidic conditions. But wait, wait a second. MgCl2 is already a soluble salt. So in pure water, it's quite soluble. Adding an acid might not significantly increase its solubility because it's already dissolved. Unless the acid reacts with the salt's ions, which in this case, CH3COOH might not react with Mg²+ or Cl⁻.

Alternatively, perhaps in a solution with a non-common ion and no precipitation, the solubility is higher. So which of the options provides that.

Option B is CBr4, which doesn't contribute any ions, so no common ion effect. So MgCl2 would be more soluble in that solution because it doesn't have any competing ions. But wait, if the solution is CBr4 in water, perhaps the solubility is not as high as in pure water because the solvent is a mix of water and CBr4. But wait, the question states that the solution is aqueous. So perhaps it's just a small amount of CBr4 in water, but the majority is water. So the MgCl2 would dissolve in the water part, and since there's no common ions, its solubility would be higher than in other options which introduce ions that cause precipitation or common ion effect.

Alternatively, I'm not entirely certain about option B because I'm not clear on how CBr4 affects the solubility. But considering the other options, the only ones that don't add problematic ions are B and F.

Between B and F, option F is an acid, which might help in solubility, but if the solution is aqueous, perhaps the best scenario is where there's no common ions, so B might be better.

Wait, but in option B, if the solution is CBr4 (aq), perhaps it's a solvent that can dissolve non-polar substances better, but MgCl2 is a polar compound. So maybe in CBr4 solution, MgCl2 isn't very soluble. But the solution is aqueous, so maybe the CBr4 is just a solute and doesn't affect much.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I: Mg(NO3)2. No, wait, Mg(NO3)2 would provide Mg²+, which would decrease the solubility of MgCl2 because of the common ion effect.

Wait, no, that's the opposite of what I want. So the best solubility would be in a solution where there's no common ions and no precipitation.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option I? No, as Mg(NO3)2 would give Mg²+, leading to lower solubility.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try a different approach. The solubility of a salt is influenced by the solubility product (Ksp). For MgCl2, Ksp is [Mg²+][Cl⁻]^2. If the solution has a high concentration of Cl⁻, the solubility decreases. Similarly, if Mg²+ is present, solubility decreases.

Now, looking for the solution that has neither Cl⁻ nor Mg²+ and doesn't introduce ions that would form a precipitate with either.

So the options that don't introduce Cl⁻ or Mg²+ are:

B: CBr4 → no ions.

C: NaOH → OH⁻, which would react with Mg²+ to form Mg(OH)₂ precipitate.

E: LiOH → same as C.

F: CH3COOH → no Cl⁻ or Mg²+.

So in options B and F, the solution doesn't have Cl⁻ or Mg²+.

In option F, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so the solution is slightly acidic. When MgCl2 dissolves, it releases Mg²+ and Cl⁻. The acidic solution might prevent the formation of Mg(OH)₂ because the pH is lower, so OH⁻ concentration is low. Thus, Mg²+ stays in solution, making MgCl2 more soluble.

In option B, the solution is CBr4, which doesn't contribute any ions. So MgCl2's solubility is governed only by its own Ksp, without any common ion effect.
