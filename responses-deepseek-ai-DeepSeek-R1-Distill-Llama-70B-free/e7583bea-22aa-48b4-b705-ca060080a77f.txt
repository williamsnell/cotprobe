Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about boiling and freezing points of a urea solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says that 10.0 grams of urea, which is CO(NH2)2, is dissolved in 200 grams of water. I need to find the boiling and freezing points of the resulting solution. The options are from A to J.

Wait, I remember that when you dissolve a solute in a solvent, it affects the boiling and freezing points. Oh right, boiling point elevation and freezing point depression. They're colligative properties, meaning they depend on the number of particles in solution.

So first, I should probably calculate the molality of the solution. Molality is moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. Right. 

Urea's molar mass: let's see, carbon is 12, oxygen 16, nitrogen 14, and hydrogen 1. So CO(NH2)2: 12 + 16 + (14*2) + (1*4) = 12+16=28, 14*2=28, 1*4=4. 28+28=56, +4 is 60 g/mol.

So 10 grams of urea is 10 / 60 = 0.1667 moles. The solvent is 200 grams, which is 0.2 kg. So molality is 0.1667 / 0.2 = 0.8333 m.

Wait, but wait. Urea is a nonelectrolyte, so it doesn't dissociate in solution. So each mole of urea gives one particle. So the van't Hoff factor i is 1. That's good to remember because it affects the calculations.

Now, for boiling point elevation, the formula is ΔTb = i*Kb*m. And for freezing point depression, ΔTf = i*Kf*m.

I think the Kb for water is 0.52°C/m and Kf is 1.86°C/m. Let me double-check those values. Oh yeah, Kb is 0.52 and Kf is 1.86.

So boiling point elevation: ΔTb = 1 * 0.52 * 0.8333 ≈ 0.4333°C. So the new boiling point is 100 + 0.4333 ≈ 100.43°C.

Freezing point depression: ΔTf = 1 * 1.86 * 0.8333 ≈ 1.55°C. So the new freezing point is 0 - 1.55 = -1.55°C.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me see which one matches that. Let's look through the options.

Option H says boiling point is 100.43°C and freezing point is -1.55°C. That's exactly what I got. So H should be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. Are Kb and Kf for water correct? I'm pretty sure Kb is 0.52, Kf 1.86. Let me think about a 1 m solution. Boiling point would be 100 + 0.52 = 100.52°C? Wait, wait, wait. Oh no, wait, if molality is 1, then ΔTb is 0.52. So yes, for 0.8333 m, it's 0.52 * 0.8333 ≈ 0.433, so 100.43°C. That's right.

And freezing point: 1.86 * 0.8333 ≈ 1.55, so the freezing point is -1.55. Yep, so H is correct.

Wait, but some options have the freezing point as 1.55°C. Like option E and F. Oh, because if it's positive, that would be wrong. Because freezing point is a depression, so it's lower than 0. So it's negative. So any option with a positive freezing point change would be wrong.

So the correct answer is H.

To determine the boiling and freezing points of the urea solution, we start by calculating the molality of the solution. The molar mass of urea, CO(NH₂)₂, is calculated as:

\[
\text{Molar mass of urea} = 12 + 16 + (14 \times 2) + (1 \times 4) = 60 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

The number of moles of urea is:

\[
\text{Moles of urea} = \frac{10.0 \, \text{g}}{60 \, \text{g/mol}} = 0.1667 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The mass of the solvent (water) is 200 g, which is equivalent to 0.2 kg. Thus, the molality of the solution is:

\[
\text{Molality} = \frac{0.1667 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{kg}} = 0.8333 \, \text{m}.
\]

Urea is a nonelectrolyte, so it does not dissociate in solution, meaning the van’t Hoff factor \(i = 1\).

Using the boiling point elevation formula:

\[
\Delta T_b = i \cdot K_b \cdot m = 1 \cdot 0.52 \, \text{°C/m} \cdot 0.8333 \, \text{m} \approx 0.4333 \, \text{°C}.
\]

The boiling point of the solution is:

\[
T_b = 100.00 \, \text{°C} + 0.4333 \, \text{°C} \approx 100.43 \, \text{°C}.
\]

For the freezing point depression:

\[
\Delta T_f = i \cdot K_f \cdot m = 1 \cdot 1.86 \, \text{°C/m} \cdot 0.8333 \, \text{m} \approx 1.55 \, \text{°C}.
\]

The freezing point of the solution is:

\[
T_f = 0.00 \, \text{°C} - 1.55 \, \text{°C} = -1.55 \, \text{°C}.
\]

Among the given options, the boiling point of 100.43°C and freezing point of -1.55°C match option **H**.
