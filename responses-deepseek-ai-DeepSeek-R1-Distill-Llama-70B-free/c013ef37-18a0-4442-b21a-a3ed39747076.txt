Okay, so I have this question about a square-based pyramid and how many sides it has, including the bottom. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my geometry, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that a pyramid typically has a base and triangular faces that converge at a point called the apex. The base in this case is square, so that's a four-sided shape. Now, the question is about the total number of sides, including the bottom.

Wait, when they say "sides," do they mean faces or edges? Oh, right, in geometry, when we talk about the number of sides of a polyhedron, we're usually referring to the faces. So each face is a flat surface. So for a square-based pyramid, I think about the structure.

The base is a square, which is one face. Then, there are four triangular faces, each connecting a side of the square base to the apex. So that's four more faces. Adding those together, 1 (base) + 4 (triangular sides) equals 5 faces in total.

But wait, the question says "including the bottom," which is the base. So yeah, that's definitely included. So the total sides (faces) are five. 

Looking at the options, option G is five. So I think the answer is G. Let me double-check. The base is one, then four sides. Yep, that's five. So I'm confident now.

The square-based pyramid has a square as its base and four triangular faces connecting each side of the base to the apex. Including the base, there are a total of five faces.
