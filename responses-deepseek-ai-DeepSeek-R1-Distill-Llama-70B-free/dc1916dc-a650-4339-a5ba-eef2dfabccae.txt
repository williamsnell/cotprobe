Okay, so I've got this question here about functions between two finite sets. Let me think through it step by step. The question says, "Let A be a finite set with m elements, and B be a finite set with n elements. The number of distinct functions mapping A into B is..." and then there are several options provided.

Hmm, I remember that a function from A to B assigns each element in A to exactly one element in B. So for each element in A, I have to choose a corresponding element in B. Since A has m elements, that means I have to make m choices, each with n possibilities.

Wait, right, so for each of the m elements in A, there are n choices in B. So the total number of functions should be the product of these choices. That is, n multiplied by itself m times, which is n^m.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see option I is n^m, and option A is m^n. Oh wait, I need to make sure I'm not mixing up m and n. Because sometimes it's easy to get them reversed.

Let me think again. Suppose A has m elements, say m=2 (like a set {a, b}), and B has n elements, say n=3 (like {1,2,3}). How many functions are there from A to B? For each element in A, I can pick any of the 3 elements in B. So for a, I have 3 choices, and for b, another 3. So total functions are 3 * 3 = 3^2, which is 9. So that's n squared when m is 2, so n^m.

Wait, let me see the options again. Option I is n^m, so that would be the correct choice here. So in the example, with m=2 and n=3, the answer would be 9, which is 3^2, which is option I.

Another way to think about it: the number of functions from A to B is the same as the number of ways to assign each element of A to an element in B. Each assignment is independent, so it's a multiplication principle problem. For each element in A, n choices, m elements, so n^m.

So the correct answer should be I: n^m.

The number of distinct functions mapping a finite set \( A \) with \( m \) elements into a finite set \( B \) with \( n \) elements is determined by considering that each element in \( A \) can independently map to any of the \( n \) elements in \( B \). Since there are \( m \) elements in \( A \), the total number of such functions is \( n^m \), as each element in \( A \) has \( n \) choices in \( B \).

Analyzing the options provided:
- Option \( A \) is \( m^n \), which would represent the number of functions from \( B \) to \( A \), not from \( A \) to \( B \).
- Option \( I \) is \( n^m \), which correctly represents the number of functions from \( A \) to \( B \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**I: \( n^m \)**
