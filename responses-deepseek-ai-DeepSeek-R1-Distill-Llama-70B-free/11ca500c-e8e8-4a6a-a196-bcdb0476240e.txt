Okay, so I've got this problem here about Henry's Law and the solubility of oxygen in water. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll take it slow.

First, the problem says Henry's Law constant K₂ is 3.30 × 10^7 torr at 25°C. Wait, no—wait, Henry's Law is about the solubility of a gas in a liquid. The formula I remember is something like C = P / K_H, where C is the concentration, P is the partial pressure, and K_H is Henry's constant. But wait, sometimes I get confused about the exact form. I think it depends on how you express the concentration.

The question is about the solubility of oxygen under room temperature. Oh, but wait, the K₂ given is for 25°C, which is room temperature, so that's the same condition. So we're okay there.

The problem states that air is 20% O₂. So the partial pressure of O₂ in air would be 20% of the total atmospheric pressure. What's the atmospheric pressure? I think it's about 760 torr at sea level. So the partial pressure P_O2 would be 0.2 * 760 torr. Let me calculate that—0.2 times 760 is 152 torr. So P is 152 torr.

Now, using Henry's Law, C = P / K_H. Wait, but wait—what's the unit of C here? I think Henry's Law can be expressed in different concentration units. Oh right, sometimes it's in mol/L, but sometimes it's in mol/kg of solvent. I need to check the units for K_H. The given K_H is 3.30e7 torr. Let me think—Henry's Law constant in this form is in units of (pressure)/(concentration). So if C is in mol/L, then K_H would have units like torr·L/mol. But I'm not entirely sure, so I might need to clarify that.

Wait, another point—the solubility is being asked per gram of water. So maybe I need to express the concentration in grams per gram of H2O. Hmm, that complicates things a bit.

Alternatively, maybe the approach is to first find the molarity (mol/L), then convert that to grams per kg of water, and then adjust to per gram. Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate partial pressure of O₂: 20% of 760 torr = 152 torr.
2. Use Henry's Law to find concentration in mol/L.
3. Convert that concentration to grams per kg of water (since 1 L of water is ~1 kg).
4. Finally, find how much that is per gram of water.

Wait, but I'm not sure if K_H is given in terms of concentration as molality (mol/kg) or molarity (mol/L). Because Henry's Law can be expressed either way. Oh wait, the units of K_H—3.30e7 torr—so if concentration is in mol/L, K_H has units of torr·L/mol. But if it's in mol/kg, then K_H would have units torr·kg/mol. Hmm.

This is confusing. Let me try to find the correct approach. 

Alternatively, I recall that the solubility of O₂ in water is often given by the formula S = (P * M) / (R * T) where M is molar mass, but perhaps that's not directly applicable here. Wait, no, Henry's Law is more like S = P/(K_H), but the way it's expressed depends on the units.

Wait, maybe I should go back to the formula. Henry's Law states that the concentration of a gas in a liquid is proportional to its partial pressure above the liquid. The formula is: C = (P)/(K_H), but the units must align.

Wait, another approach: using the solubility formula in terms of Henry's constant.

The Henry's Law constant (K_H) is given by K_H = P / x, where x is the mole fraction of the gas in the solution. But that's when dealing with mole fractions, which might not be the most straightforward way here.

Alternatively, another form I've seen is C = (P) / (K_H), where C is in mol/L, and K_H is in units of L·atm/mol or similar. Wait, no, the units have to match. If K_H is in torr, then perhaps the concentration is in mol per liter per torr.

Wait, I'm getting myself stuck here. Let me think about the units in the problem. The given K_H is 3.30 ×10^7 torr. So let's see—if I have C = P/(K_H), then the units would be (torr) / (torr) → unitless? That can't be right. Wait, no, that's if the units are same. So perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong.

Wait, another version: Henry's Law is expressed as P = K_H * C, where P is the partial pressure, K_H is the Henry's constant, and C is the concentration (in mol/L or mol/kg). So rearranging, C = P / K_H.

So if K_H is in terms of (pressure)/(concentration), then the units of K_H would be, say, (atm·L)/mol or (torr·L)/mol, depending on how it's expressed.

Wait, the given K_H is 3.30 ×10^7 torr. So if I'm using C in mol/L, then K_H must have units of torr·L/mol, so that when you multiply by C (mol/L), you get torr.

Wait, that makes sense. So K_H (torr·L/mol) multiplied by C (mol/L) would give units of torr, which matches the pressure P.

So, let's proceed.

P_O2 is 152 torr.

K_H is 3.30e7 torr·L/mol.

So, C (mol/L) = P / K_H = 152 / 3.30e7.

Let me compute that. 

152 divided by 3.3e7.

3.3e7 is 33,000,000.

So 152 / 33,000,000 = let's compute this.

152 ÷ 33,000,000.

Well, 33,000,000 is 3.3e7.

So 152 / 3.3e7 = (152 /3.3) ) * 1e-7.

152 divided by 3.3 is approximately 46.06.

So 46.06e-7 mol/L.

Which is 4.606e-6 mol/L.

So approximately 4.606e-6 moles of O2 per liter of water.

But wait, the question asks for how many grams of O2 in 1 gram of H2O. Hmm. So I need to convert this concentration into grams per gram.

First, let's think about the molarity. 1 liter of water is approximately 1000 grams. So a concentration of C mol/L is C mol per 1000 grams of water.

So for our case, 4.606e-6 mol/L translates to 4.606e-6 mol per 1000 g H2O.

So per gram, it's (4.606e-6 / 1000) mol/g.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1 liter is about 1000 grams, so 1 L = 1 kg ≈ 1000 g.

So, C is in mol/L, which is mol per kg (since 1 L ≈ 1 kg for water). So if C is 4.606e-6 mol/L, that's 4.606e-6 mol per kg.

So per kg is 1000 grams, so per gram would be (4.606e-6) / 1000 mol/g.

Wait, wait, no, because 1 kg = 1000 g. So 4.606e-6 mol per kg is the same as 4.606e-6 / 1000 mol per gram.

Wait, no, because 1 kg is 1000 g, so 4.606e-6 mol per 1000 g equals 4.606e-9 mol per gram.

So per gram of water, it's 4.606e-9 mol.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe another approach: Let's compute the grams per kg first, then per gram.

So, the molarity is 4.606e-6 mol/L.

Since 1 L is about 1 kg, that's 4.606e-6 mol/kg.

Now, the molar mass of O₂ is 32 g/mol (since each O is 16, 16*2=32).

So, in one kg of water, how many grams of O₂ are dissolved? That would be mol/kg multiplied by molar mass.

So 4.606e-6 mol/kg * 32 g/mol = 1.474e-4 grams/kg.

Wait, 4.606e-6 *32 = let's compute that.

4.606e-6 * 32 = (4.606 *32) *1e-6.

4 *32=128, 0.606 *32≈19.392. So 128 +19.392=147.392. So 147.392e-6 g per kg.

Which is 1.47392e-4 g/kg.

But wait, 1 kg is 1000 g. So per gram, it's (1.47392e-4 g/kg) / 1000 g/kg = 1.47392e-7 g/g.

Wait, that's 1.47e-7 g O₂ per g H₂O.

Looking at the options, let's see—option B is 4.17e-6, option C is 8.34e-7, option H is 3.34e-7, etc.

Hmm, my calculation gives approximately 1.47e-7 g/g. But none of the options match exactly. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation steps. Let me go back.

Wait, in the step where C = P / K_H, let me compute that more accurately.

P = 152 torr.

K_H = 3.30e7 torr.

So C = 152 / 3.3e7 = let's compute this as 152 / 33,000,000.

Let me compute 152 ÷ 33,000,000.

33,000,000 is 3.3e7.

So 152 / 3.3e7 = (1.52e2) / (3.3e7) )= (1.52 / 3.3) ) * 1e-5.

1.52 / 3.3 is approximately 0.4606.

So 0.4606e-5 = 4.606e-6 mol/L.

Yes, that's correct.

So, 4.606e-6 mol/L.

Which is 4.606e-6 mol per liter.

Since 1 liter is about 1kg, it's 4.606e-6 mol/kg.

Then, moles to grams: 4.606e-6 mol/kg * 32 g/mol = 1.474e-4 g/kg.

Wait, 4.606e-6 *32 = (4.606 *32) e-6 → 147.392e-6 → 0.000147392 g/kg.

Which is 1.47392e-4 g/kg.

So, per kg (1000g), it's 0.000147392 g.

Wait, but per gram, divide by 1000.

So 0.000147392 g / 1000 g H2O → 1.47392e-7 g/g.

Hmm, but none of the options seem to match that. The options are:

A:8.34e-6

B:4.17e-6

C:8.34e-7

D:1.67e-5

E:4.17e-5

F:1.67e-4

G:8.34e-4

H:3.34e-7

I:6.68e-6

J:8.34e-5

So the closest is option C:8.34e-7, but my value is 1.47e-7. Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the conversion.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units of K_H. Because I assumed K_H is in torr·L/mol, but maybe it's in torr·kg/mol? Let me think.

If K_H is in torr·kg/mol, then when I compute C = P / K_H, the units would be (torr) / (torr·kg/mol) → mol/kg.

Which would make sense.

Wait, so if K_H is 3.30e7 torr·kg/mol, then C (mol/kg) = P (torr) / K_H (torr·kg/mol) → unit is mol/kg.

So, let me recalculate.

P = 152 torr.

K_H = 3.30e7 torr·kg/mol.

So C = 152 / 3.3e7 = 4.606e-6 mol/kg.

Which is the same number as before, 4.606e-6 mol/kg.

Then, grams per kg: 4.606e-6 mol/kg * 32 g/mol = 1.474e-4 g/kg.

Same as before. So same result.

Hmm, but the options don't include this value. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the units of K_H. Because I think Henry's Law in some contexts uses K_H in (atm)/(mol fraction), but in this case, perhaps it's using a different unit setup.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the gas constant R in the calculation. Wait, let me think differently.

Another approach—using PV = nRT.

But Henry's Law is a different approach. Wait, maybe I need to calculate the mole fraction first.

Let me think again: Henry's Law can be expressed as P = K_H * x, where x is the mole fraction of the gas in solution. Then, x would be P / K_H.

But how does that help me find the solubility in g per g of water?

Wait, perhaps I can find the mole fraction x, then use that to find the concentration.

So x = P / K_H = 152 / 3.3e7 ≈ 4.606e-6.

So the mole fraction of O2 in water is 4.606e-6.

The mole fraction is (moles of O2) / (moles of O2 + moles of H2O). Since moles of O2 are much smaller, it's approximately (moles of O2) / (moles of H2O).

So, if n_O2 is the moles of O2, and n_H2O is the moles of H2O, then x ≈ n_O2 / n_H2O.

So, n_O2 ≈ x * n_H2O.

Now, per 1 g of H2O, how many moles is that? Molar mass of H2O is 18 g/mol.

So, 1 g H2O is (1/18) mol H2O.

So, n_H2O = 1/18 ≈ 0.05556 mol.

Then, n_O2 = x * n_H2O = 4.606e-6 * 0.05556 ≈ 2.556e-7 mol.

Then, the mass of O2 is n_O2 * molar mass of O2 = 2.556e-7 * 32 ≈ 8.179e-6 g.

So, per gram of H2O, it's about 8.18e-6 g O2.

Wait, that gives 8.18e-6 g/g, which is 8.18 ×10^-6 g O2 in 1g H2O.

Looking at the options, option A is 8.34e-6, which is very close. Hmm, but why the slight difference?

Wait, maybe in the calculation I made some approximations. Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute x = 152 / 3.3e7.

3.3e7 is 33,000,000.

152 /33,000,000 = let's compute this as 0.00000460606.

Which is 4.60606e-6.

Then, n_O2 = x * n_H2O.

n_H2O in 1g is 1/18 = 0.0555555556 mol.

So, n_O2 = 4.60606e-6 * 0.0555555556 ≈ ?

4.60606e-6 * 0.0555555556 ≈ (4.60606 *0.0555555556) e-6.

4.60606 * 0.0555555556 ≈ let's compute this.

0.0555555556 is 1/18. So 4.60606 * (1/18) = 4.60606 /18 ≈ 0.2559.

So, 0.2559e-6 → 2.559e-7 mol.

Molar mass of O2 is 32 g/mol.

So, mass = 2.559e-7 *32 = 8.1888e-6 g.

Approximately 8.19e-6 g per gram of H2O.

Looking at the options, option A is 8.34e-6, which is very close. So maybe I made a slight miscalculation in the exact numbers.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate 152 /33,000,000 more precisely.

152 divided by 33,000,000.

33,000,000 is 3.3e7.

So 152 /3.3e7 = (1.52e2)/(3.3e7) ) = (1.52/3.3) *1e-5.

1.52 /3.3 = 0.460606...

So 0.460606e-5 → 4.60606e-6.

Then, n_O2 = x * n_H2O = 4.60606e-6 * (1/18) → 4.60606e-6 *0.0555555556 = ?

4.60606e-6 * 0.0555555556 = 

Let me compute 4.60606 *0.0555555556:

4 *0.055555
