Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the heat required for two different scenarios. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Oh right, it's about heating water and aluminum. I remember that heat transfer has something to do with specific heat capacity, mass, and temperature change. 

Alright, the question is in two parts: part (a) is about converting a liter of water from 30°C to 60°C, and part (b) is heating a 1 kg block of aluminum from 30°C to 60°C. The specific heats are given as 1 cal/g°C for water and 0.215 cal/g°C for aluminum.

Wait, wait. I need to calculate the quantity of heat for each part and then match it to the options provided. Let me think about the formula. Oh right, the formula is Q = m * c * ΔT, where m is mass, c is specific heat, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

Starting with part (a): heating water. A liter of water. Oh, I remember that 1 liter of water is approximately 1000 grams, right? Because 1 kg is 1000 grams and water's density is about 1 g/cm³. So mass m is 1000 grams.

The temperature change ΔT is from 30°C to 60°C. So that's a 30 degree increase. So ΔT is 30°C.

The specific heat of water is given as 1 cal/g°C. So putting it all together: Q = 1000 g * 1 cal/(g°C) * 30°C. Let me calculate that. 1000 times 1 is 1000, times 30 is 30,000 calories. Oh wait, but the options are in Kcal. Oh right, 1 Kcal is 1000 calories. So 30,000 calories is 30 Kcal. So part (a) is 30 Kcal.

Wait, but I should check my units again. Yeah, grams to kg? Wait no, because the specific heat is given per gram, so the mass is in grams. So 1000 grams is correct. So yes, 30 Kcal for part (a).

Now part (b): heating aluminum. The mass is given as 1 kg. But wait, the specific heat is in cal per gram, so I need to convert kg to grams. 1 kg is 1000 grams. So m is 1000 grams.

The temperature change is same, 30°C. The specific heat of aluminum is 0.215 cal/g°C. So Q = 1000 g * 0.215 cal/(g°C) * 30°C.

Let me compute that. 1000 * 0.215 is 215. Then multiply by 30. 215 *30 is 6450 calories. Converting to Kcal, divide by 1000, so 6.45 Kcal. Wait, that's 6.45 Kcal for part (b).

So looking at the options, part (a) is 30 and part (b) is 6.45. Let me scan the options:

Option G is 30 Kcal and 6.45 Kcal. That seems to match.

Wait, just double-checking. Did I make any mistakes? Let's see:

Part (a): 1 liter water is 1000g. Specific heat 1. ΔT 30. So 1000 * 1 * 30 = 30,000 cal = 30 Kcal. Yep.

Part (b): 1 kg Al is 1000g. Specific heat 0.215. ΔT 30. So 1000 * 0.215 = 215. 215 *30=6450 cal=6.45 Kcal. Right.

Looking at the options again:

Option G: 30 Kcal, 6.45 Kcal. So the answer should be G.

To calculate the heat required for the given scenarios, we use the formula for heat transfer:

\[
Q = m \cdot c \cdot \Delta T
\]

where \( m \) is the mass, \( c \) is the specific heat capacity, and \( \Delta T \) is the temperature change.

---

### Part (a): Heating 1 liter of water from 30°C to 60°C
- **Mass of water**: \( 1 \, \text{liter} = 1000 \, \text{g} \)
- **Specific heat of water**: \( c = 1 \, \text{cal/g°C} \)
- **Temperature change**: \( \Delta T = 60°C - 30°C = 30°C \)

Substituting into the formula:

\[
Q = 1000 \, \text{g} \cdot 1 \, \text{cal/(g°C)} \cdot 30°C = 30,000 \, \text{cal} = 30 \, \text{Kcal}
\]

Thus, the heat required for part (a) is \( 30 \, \text{Kcal} \).

### Part (b): Heating 1 kg of aluminum from 30°C to 60°C
- **Mass of aluminum**: \( 1 \, \text{kg} = 1000 \, \text{g} \)
- **Specific heat of aluminum**: \( c = 0.215 \, \text{cal/(g°C)} \)
- **Temperature change**: \( \Delta T = 60°C - 30°C = 30°C \)

Substituting into the formula:

\[
Q = 1000 \, \text{g} \cdot 0.215 \, \text{cal/(g°C)} \cdot 30°C = 6,450 \, \text{cal} = 6.45 \, \text{Kcal}
\]

Thus, the heat required for part (b) is \( 6.45 \, \text{Kcal} \).

---

### Final Answer
From the calculations:
- Part (a): \( 30 \, \text{Kcal} \)
- Part (b): \( 6.45 \, \text{Kcal} \)

The correct option is **G: 30 Kcal, 6.45 Kcal**.
