Okay, so I've got this question about banking reserves, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is, a bank has $500 in checking deposits. The bank is required to reserve $50. They're asking for two things: the reserve ratio and the amount in excess reserves. Then there are multiple-choice options to choose from.

Hmm, I remember that the reserve ratio is the percentage of deposits that a bank must hold in reserves. So, if the bank has $500 in deposits, and required reserves are $50, I think the reserve ratio is calculated by dividing the required reserves by the total deposits.

Wait, so the formula would be reserve ratio = (required reserves / total deposits) * 100 to get the percentage. So plugging in the numbers: 50 divided by 500 is 0.1, which is 10%. So the reserve ratio is 10%.

Now, the second part is about excess reserves. Excess reserves are the amount the bank has in reserves beyond what is required. So if required reserves are $50, and the bank's total reserves are the same as the required because that's all they're holding, right? Or wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says the bank is required to reserve $50. So does that mean the bank has exactly $50 in reserves, or more? Oh, the question doesn't specify the actual reserves, only the required.

Wait, maybe I made a wrong assumption. Let me think again. Oh, wait, in this question, maybe the bank's actual reserves are the same as the required? Because sometimes, when they say the bank is required to reserve X, they're implying that those are the reserves they hold. Or maybe not? Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up concepts.

Wait, no, I think the question is giving the required reserves as $50, but the bank might hold more. But wait, in the question, it just says "the bank is required to reserve $50", so perhaps that's the amount they are holding as reserves. Because if they had more, the question would have specified the total reserves. So in this case, the bank's reserves are $50, which is the required amount. So their excess reserves would be zero? But that's not one of the options.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's clarify:

Reserve ratio (or reserve requirement) is the percentage of deposits that must be held in reserves. So if the reserve ratio is 10%, then for every $100 in deposits, the bank must keep $10 in reserves.

In this case, deposits are $500. So required reserves are 10% of 500, which is $50. So the reserve ratio is 10%, and the required reserves are $50.

Now, the question is asking how much the bank has in excess reserves. Excess reserves are the reserves held beyond the required amount. So if the bank's actual reserves are more than $50, the difference is excess. But the question doesnâ€™t say how much the bank actually holds in reserves, just that it's required to hold $50. So maybe the bank is holding exactly what's required, so excess reserves are zero. But again, none of the options have zero.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me look again. The question says "the bank is required to reserve $50." So the required reserves are $50. Now, the bank might have more than that in reserves. But the question doesn't state the actual reserves. Hmm, that's confusing. Because if the bank's actual reserves are $500, then excess would be $450, but that's not supported by the question.

Wait, maybe the total deposits are $500, and required reserves are $50. So the bank must set aside $50, and the rest can be used for loans or other things. But the question is about excess reserves, which would be the amount the bank holds beyond the required.

Wait, but without knowing the actual reserves, how can we compute excess? So perhaps the question is implying that the bank only holds the required amount, so excess is zero. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating the excess. Wait, perhaps the bank's total reserves are the same as required, so no excess. But in the options, I don't see zero.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option I says 10% and $450 in excess. That would mean the bank has $500 in deposits, 10% reserve ratio (so $50 required), and the bank has $50 + $450 = $500 in reserves. But why would the bank have $500 in reserves if deposits are $500? That doesn't make sense because then all the deposits are in reserves, and no loans are made. So that's possible, but then the option would have excess reserves of $450.

But the question says the bank is required to reserve $50. So if the bank's reserves are $500, then excess would be $450, which is what option I says. But I thought the question implies that the bank has $50 in reserves because that's the required amount, so excess would be zero. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me think again. The question states the bank has $500 in checking deposits and is required to reserve $50. So, the reserve ratio is 10% because 50/500 is 0.1, which is 10%.

Now, the excess reserves would be the actual reserves minus required reserves. But the question doesn't say how much the bank has in actual reserves. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Maybe the bank's reserves are $500, as checking deposits are $500, so required is $50, so excess is $450. But that would mean the bank is holding all deposits in reserves, which is possible but not typical.

Alternatively, perhaps the question considers that the bank's reserves are exactly the required amount, so excess is zero. But none of the options have that.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option I: 10% and $450 excess.

Option B: 10% and $50 excess.

Option H: 20% and $400 excess.

So perhaps the question is implying that the bank's total reserves are $500, but that doesn't make sense because deposits are $500, so if reserves are $500, then the bank can't lend anything. So that's a 100% reserve ratio, which isn't any option here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased as the bank having $500 in deposits and $50 in required reserves. So the reserve ratio is 10%, and the bank might have, say, $50 in reserves, making excess zero. But since that's not an option, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. The question is phrased as "the bank is required to reserve $50." So maybe the reserve ratio is 10%, and the bank's actual reserves are $500, which would make excess reserves $450, as in option I.

Wait, but that would mean the bank is holding 100% reserves, which is unusual. Alternatively, perhaps the bank's reserves are $50, so excess is zero. But that's not an option. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is giving the required reserves as $50, but the bank's actual reserves are more. Wait, but the question doesn't state that. It only says the bank is required to hold $50. So without knowing the actual reserves, I can't compute the excess. So maybe the question assumes that the bank is holding only the required amount, so excess is zero. But again, that's not an option.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me go back.

Reserve ratio is (required reserves / total deposits) *100. So 50 / 500 *100 = 10%. So the ratio is 10%, which matches options B and I.

Excess reserves are (actual reserves - required reserves). But without knowing actual reserves, maybe the question assumes that the bank is holding only the required, so excess is zero. But again, none of the options have that. So perhaps the question is structured differently.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between required reserves and actual reserves. The question says the bank has $500 in checking deposits, and is required to reserve $50. So the required reserves are $50. Now, what are the actual reserves the bank holds? Are they only $50 or more?

If the bank holds exactly the required amount, then excess reserves are zero. But that's not an option. So perhaps the question is implying that the bank's reserves are $500, making the excess $450. But that would mean the reserve ratio is 100%, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating the excess. Wait, perhaps the bank's total reserves are the same as the required, so excess is zero. But again, that's not an option.

Wait, looking at the options again, option I says 10% ratio and $450 in excess. That would mean the bank's actual reserves are $500, which is the entire deposits. But that's a 100% reserve ratio, which contradicts the 10% given.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let's think about the possible answers.

If the reserve ratio is 10%, then required reserves are $50. The excess reserves would be whatever is above that. So if the bank has, say, $500 in reserves, then excess is $450, but that's not realistic because the bank wouldn't have more reserves than deposits. Alternatively, maybe the bank has $100 in reserves. So excess would be $50. That would correspond to option B, which says 10% and $50 excess.

Wait, but where does $100 come from? The question doesn't give the actual reserves. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, maybe the question is a trick question. It says the bank has $500 in checking deposits and is required to reserve $50. So the reserve ratio is 10%, and the excess is the amount they have beyond that. But without the actual reserves, we can't compute it. So perhaps the question assumes that the bank's reserves are exactly $50, making excess zero. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the reserve ratio and the maximum possible excess, which would be if the bank held all deposits as reserves, which would be $500. But that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the question is giving the required reserves as $50, and the bank's reserves are $500, so excess is $450. But then the reserve ratio would be 100%, which is not 10%. So that doesn't make sense.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again. The reserve ratio is 10%, so the required reserves are $50. Now, the question is about excess reserves, which is the amount the bank holds above the required. So if the question states the bank has $500 in deposits and is required to reserve $50, perhaps the bank's actual reserves are $500, making the excess $450. But that would mean the bank is holding all deposits in reserves, which is possible, but the reserve ratio in that case would be 100%, not 10%.

Alternatively, perhaps the bank's actual reserves are $50, making excess zero. But again, no option has that.

Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Perhaps the $500 is the amount in checking deposits, and the required reserve is $50, so the bank must set aside $50. The excess is the rest, so $500 - $50 = $450. But wait, that's the amount that can be lent out, not the excess reserves. Excess reserves are the reserves beyond the required.

Wait, no, the formula for excess reserves is actual reserves minus required reserves. So if the bank has $X in actual reserves, then excess is X - 50.

But without knowing X, I can't find the number. So perhaps the question is assuming that the bank is holding exactly the required amount, so X = 50, making excess zero. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is mixing up total reserves and deposits. Let me think: maybe the bank's reserves are $500, which includes the required $50, so excess would be $450. But then the reserve ratio would be 50/500=10%, which matches option I's 10% and $450 in excess.

Ah, that makes sense. So the reserve ratio is 10%, and the excess is $450. So the correct answer would be option I.

Wait, let me make sure. If the bank has $500 in checking deposits, the required reserves are $50 (10% of 500). If the bank's actual reserves are $500, then the excess is 500 - 50 = $450. So the reserve ratio is 10%, excess is $450, which is option I.

The question involves calculating the reserve ratio and determining the excess reserves for a bank with $500 in checking deposits, where the bank is required to reserve $50. 

1. **Reserve Ratio Calculation**:  
   The reserve ratio is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Reserve Ratio} = \left(\frac{\text{Required Reserves}}{\text{Total Deposits}}\right) \times 100
   \]  
   Substituting the given values:  
   \[
   \text{Reserve Ratio} = \left(\frac{50}{500}\right) \times 100 = 10\%
   \]  

2. **Excess Reserves Calculation**:  
   Excess reserves are the amount of reserves the bank holds beyond the required reserves. The question does not explicitly state the bank's actual reserves, but it can be inferred that the bank holds $500 in total reserves (since the total deposits are $500, and it is implied that the bank holds all deposits in reserves). Therefore:  
   \[
   \text{Excess Reserves} = \text{Actual Reserves} - \text{Required Reserves} = 500 - 50 = 450
   \]  

3. **Evaluating the Options**:  
   - Option I states a 10% reserve ratio and $450 in excess reserves, which matches the calculations above.  
   - Other options either have incorrect reserve ratios or incorrect excess reserves.  

Thus, the correct answer is **Option I: 10 percent and $450 in excess reserves**.
