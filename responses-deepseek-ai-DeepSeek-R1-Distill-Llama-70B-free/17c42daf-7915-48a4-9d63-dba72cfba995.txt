Okay, so I've got this problem here about a sofa with a 20% markup based on its selling price. I need to find the percent markup based on the cost. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about markups and how they're calculated, but let me try to work through it step by step.

Wait, markup based on selling price versus costâ€”what's the difference? I remember that markup can be calculated in two ways: one based on the cost and another based on the selling price. The key here is understanding what each means.

Let me think. If the markup is based on the cost, it's the amount added to the cost to get the selling price. So markup percentage = (markup / cost) * 100. But in this problem, the markup is given as 20% of the selling price. So that would be markup percentage = (markup / selling price) * 100, which is 20% here.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, if it's 20% markup based on the selling price, that means the markup is 20% of the selling price. So the markup amount is 0.2 times the selling price. But I need to find the markup based on cost, which would be (markup / cost) * 100.

So let me try to model this. Let's denote:

C = cost price
S = selling price
M = markup

Given that the markup is 20% of the selling price. So M = 0.2 * S.

But I also know that selling price is cost plus markup, so S = C + M.

Substituting M from the first equation into the second: S = C + 0.2*S.

Hmm. Let me solve for C in terms of S. So S - 0.2S = C => 0.8 S = C. So C = 0.8 S.

Now, the markup based on cost would be (M / C) * 100. We know M is 0.2 S and C is 0.8 S.

So substituting, (0.2 S / 0.8 S) * 100 = (0.2/0.8) * 100 = (0.25) * 100 = 25%.

Wait, that's 25% markup based on cost. So looking at the options, option I is 25%. So the answer should be I.

Wait, let me double-check in case I made a mistake. So selling price S is cost plus markup. The markup is 20% of S, so M = 0.2 S. Then S = C + 0.2 S => C = 0.8 S. Then the markup based on cost is (M/C)*100 = (0.2 S / 0.8 S)*100 = (0.25)*100=25%. Yep, that seems correct.
</think>

To solve the problem, we start by understanding that the markup is given as 20% of the selling price. Let:

- \( C \) = cost price  
- \( S \) = selling price  
- \( M \) = markup amount  

Given that the markup is 20% of the selling price, we have:  
\[
M = 0.2 \cdot S
\]  

The selling price is also the sum of the cost and the markup:  
\[
S = C + M
\]  

Substituting \( M = 0.2 \cdot S \) into \( S = C + M \):  
\[
S = C + 0.2 \cdot S
\]  

Rearranging to solve for \( C \):  
\[
S - 0.2 \cdot S = C \implies 0.8 \cdot S = C \implies C = 0.8 \cdot S
\]  

Now, to find the markup based on the cost, we calculate:  
\[
\text{Markup percentage based on cost} = \frac{M}{C} \cdot 100
\]  

Substitute \( M = 0.2 \cdot S \) and \( C = 0.8 \cdot S \):  
\[
\text{Markup percentage based on cost} = \frac{0.2 \cdot S}{0.8 \cdot S} \cdot 100 = \frac{0.2}{0.8} \cdot 100 = 25\%
\]  

Thus, the percent markup based on the cost is **25%**.
