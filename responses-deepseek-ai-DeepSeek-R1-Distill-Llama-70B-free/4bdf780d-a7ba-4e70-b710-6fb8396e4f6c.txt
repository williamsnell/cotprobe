Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about what a normative perspective is. Hmm, I remember that in social sciences, especially in sociology and ethics, there are different perspectives like descriptive and normative. Let me think.

Normative refers to norms, right? So it's about what should be, not what is. Like, it's about values and norms that dictate behavior. So a normative perspective would be looking at how things should be according to certain standards or ideals.

Looking at the options:

A: The way things were. That sounds more like a historical perspective.
B: The way things might have been. Hmm, maybe alternative history or something.
C: The way things are going to be. That's future-looking, maybe predictive.
D: The way things are perceived to be. That sounds more like a subjective view or maybe a social construct, but not necessarily normative.
E: The way things are. That's descriptive, just stating facts as they exist.
F: The way things could have been. Another alternative, but not about norms.
G: The way things should be. Oh, that fits with what I was thinking. Normative is about what should be.
H: The way things were thought to be. Maybe like old beliefs, but not about the 'should'.
I: The way things appear to be. Similar to D, about perception.
J: The way things could be. That's possibilities, not necessarily norms.

So the correct answer should be G. Because normative is about the 'ought'â€”what should be, based on norms or values.

The normative perspective is concerned with what should be, based on norms, values, or ideals. It focuses on how things ought to be rather than how they are. Among the options, G: "The way things should be" aligns with this definition.

Answer: G
