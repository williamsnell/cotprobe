Question:

A state has a statute prohibiting the sale of guns and ammunition to any person under the age of 17. Violation of the statute is a felony punishable by a fine of $5,000 and imprisonment for up to two years. The state courts have interpreted this statute as a public welfare offense requiring no particular mental state for its violation. As such, this is a strict liability crime whereby culpability is imposed on a defendant for doing the proscribed act. A defendant, a 15-year-old, entered the store to purchase a shotgun as a present for her father. She took a shotgun off the shelf and went to the cashier's counter to pay for it. Not seeing the cashier anywhere, the defendant left the exact price for the shotgun on the countertop and left the store. If the defendant is prosecuted for violating the state statute, she should be found

Options:

A: not guilty, provided that the legislative intent was not to make the purchase of shotguns a criminal offense.
B: not guilty, if she believed the gun was a toy and not a real weapon.
C: not guilty, because she did not have any criminal intent when purchasing the shotgun.
D: guilty, because she did not wait for the cashier to handle the transaction properly.
E: not guilty, provided that she returns the shotgun immediately upon learning of the statute.
F: not guilty, provided she was unaware that the statute prohibited the sale of weapons to a person in her age group.
G: guilty, because she purchased the shotgun while under the statutory age.
H: guilty, because she left the money for the shotgun and took the gun without any supervision.
I: guilty, because her age alone qualifies her for the strict liability of the statute.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this law question. Let me read through it carefully.

Alright, the question is about a state statute that prohibits selling guns and ammunition to anyone under 17. Violating this is a felony with a $5,000 fine and up to two years in prison. The state courts have interpreted this as a public welfare offense, meaning it's a strict liability crime. So, no particular mental state is requiredâ€”just doing the prohibited act makes you guilty.

The defendant is a 15-year-old who went into a store to buy a shotgun as a gift for her dad. She took the shotgun off the shelf and went to the cashier. But the cashier wasn't there, so she left the exact price on the counter and left with the shotgun.

Now, the question is whether she's guilty under this statute.

Hmm. So, let's break it down. Strict liability means that intent doesn't matter. So even if she didn't mean to break the law, if she did the act prohibited, she's guilty.

The statute prohibits the sale to anyone under 17. But wait, does it prohibit the sale, or does it prohibit the purchase? The wording says "sale of guns... to any person under 17." So, the seller is the one committing the crime if they sell to a minor. But here, the defendant is the buyer, not the seller. Wait, but the question says the defendant is prosecuted for violating the statute. So maybe the statute also prohibits the underage person from purchasing?

Wait, I need to check the wording again. The statute prohibits the sale to any person under 17. So the seller is the one who can't sell. But then the question is, can the buyer also be prosecuted? Or is the statute only imposing liability on the seller?

Wait, in many jurisdictions, the sale to minors is prohibited, but the minors themselves might not be guilty under that particular statute. But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the question says the defendant is a 15-year-old who went to purchase a shotgun. She took it off the shelf, went to the cashier, didn't find anyone, so she left the money and took the gun. So, she's effectively taken the shotgun without completing the sale through the cashier.

But the statute is about selling to someone under 17. So, if the sale didn't actually happen because the cashier wasn't there, did the sale occur? Or does the act of taking the gun and leaving the money constitute a purchase?

Wait, but the statute is about selling, not about purchasing. So maybe the defendant isn't guilty under this statute because she's the buyer, not the seller. But wait, perhaps the statute also applies to the buyer? Or is it only the seller's responsibility?

Wait, the question says the state courts have interpreted this as a public welfare offense requiring no mental state. So it's strict liability for whoever violates it. But if the statute is about selling, then only the seller is violating it. Unless the statute also prohibits purchasing by minors.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the options.

Option A: Not guilty if legislative intent wasn't to make purchase criminal. But the question says the statute prohibits sale, not purchase. So maybe she's not guilty because she's the buyer, not seller.

Option B: Not guilty if she thought it was a toy. But strict liability doesn't care about her belief.

Option C: Not guilty because no criminal intent. But strict liability doesn't require intent, so this isn't a valid defense.

Option D: Guilty because she didn't wait for cashier. So she took the gun without proper transaction. But does that make her guilty under the statute? The statute is about selling, not about how the sale is conducted.

Option E: Not guilty if she returns upon learning. But strict liability doesn't allow for that defense.

Option F: Not guilty if she was unaware of the statute. Again, strict liability doesn't care about knowledge.

Option G: Guilty because she purchased under age. But the statute prohibits selling, not buying. Unless the statute also applies to buyers, which isn't clear.

Option H: Guilty because she left money and took gun. Maybe this is about theft? But the question is about the gun statute, not theft.

Option I: Guilty because her age makes her strictly liable. But again, the statute is about selling to minors, not minors buying.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Maybe the statute also criminalizes the act of attempting to purchase by a minor. Let me re-read the statute description.

The statute prohibits the sale to under 17. So the seller is the one who can't sell. But if the buyer tries to buy, perhaps that's not covered. Unless there's another statute about minors purchasing. But the question only gives us this one statute.

So if the defendant is the buyer, and the statute is about selling, then she's not guilty under this statute. But the question says she's prosecuted under this statute. So maybe the answer depends on whether the statute applies to the buyer.

Wait, perhaps the act of purchasing constitutes an attempt to engage in a prohibited sale. Or maybe the statute is broader.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that she's under 17 and attempted to purchase, so she's guilty under the statute, but that depends on how the statute is worded.

Wait, the statute says "sale of guns... to any person under 17." So the sale is prohibited, but does it make the buyer guilty? Or only the seller?

In many real laws, like selling alcohol to minors, the seller is the one committing the offense, not the minor. But sometimes, minors are also prohibited from attempting to purchase. But in this question, the statute only prohibits the sale, not the purchase.

So in this case, the defendant, as the buyer, wouldn't be guilty under this statute because it's the seller's responsibility. Unless the statute also criminalizes the act of a minor purchasing, which it doesn't as per the description.

Wait, but perhaps the way she took the gun without paying through the cashier constitutes theft, but that's a separate issue not covered by this statute. The question is specifically about the gun sale statute.

So if the statute only prohibits selling to minors, then the seller is guilty, not the buyer. Therefore, the defendant (buyer) wouldn't be guilty under this statute.

Looking at the options, which ones align with this.

Option A: Not guilty if legislative intent wasn't to criminalize purchase. But the question says the statute is about sale, so it's not about purchase, so she's not guilty regardless of intent.

Option I says guilty because her age makes her strictly liable. But the statute is about the seller, not the buyer, so her age wouldn't make her guilty under this statute.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The statute prohibits selling to under 17, so only the seller can be prosecuted. So the defendant, being the buyer, is not guilty under this statute. So the correct answer would be not guilty.

Looking at the options, which ones say not guilty.

Options A, B, C, E, F.

But which one is correct.

The question is whether she is guilty. The options:

A: Not guilty, provided legislative intent wasn't to make purchase criminal.

But the statute doesn't criminalize purchase, so regardless of intent, she's not guilty. So A's condition might not matter.

Wait, perhaps the answer is A, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is G or I, but that would be if the statute applied to her as buyer.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach it differently.

Strict liability crime: the act is enough, no intent needed.

In this case, the act prohibited is selling to under 17. So the actus reus is selling to a minor. The defendant didn't sell; she tried to buy. So she didn't commit the prohibited act.

Therefore, she's not guilty.

So looking at the options, the correct answer would be one that says not guilty because she didn't commit the act prohibited (selling), but none of the options state that directly.

Wait, let me re-examine the options.

Option A: Not guilty, provided legislative intent wasn't to make purchase a crime.

If the statute prohibits sale, then purchase isn't criminalized. So regardless of intent, she's not guilty.

Therefore, the correct answer would be A? Or perhaps another option.

Wait, option I says guilty because her age makes her strictly liable. But that's only if the statute applies to her, which it doesn't. The statute applies to the seller.

Wait, perhaps the answer is A because the statute doesn't criminalize purchasing.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E, but E talks about returning the shotgun, which isn't relevant because strict liability doesn't allow for that.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about what the statute criminalizes. It criminalizes the act of selling to a minor. The defendant is the buyer, so she didn't sell anything. Therefore, she didn't violate the statute. So she should be found not guilty.

Looking at the options, which ones say not guilty.

Option A: Not guilty, provided legislative intent wasn't to criminalize purchase.

But the statute clearly doesn't criminalize purchase, so she's not guilty regardless of intent.

So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me check other options. Option F says not guilty if she was unaware. But strict liability doesn't care about awareness, so F isn't correct.

Option C says not guilty because no criminal intent, but strict liability doesn't require intent, so C is incorrect.

Wait, but wait. Another angle: perhaps the statute is interpreted to include both the seller and the buyer. But the question doesn't state that. It only says the statute prohibits the sale, so only the seller is guilty.

So the correct answer is A or another not guilty option.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is G or I, but I think they're incorrect because they assume she's guilty under the statute, which she isn't as a buyer.

Wait, maybe I'm missing that the defendant could be guilty of attempted purchase, but the statute doesn't mention attempts. It's a strict liability offense for the completed act of sale.

So, I think the correct answer is A: not guilty, provided the legislative intent wasn't to make purchase criminal.

But wait, the legislative intent is clear from the statute's wording. The statute prohibits the sale, not the purchase. So her purchase isn't criminalized, so she's not guilty regardless.

So the answer would be A.

Wait, no, because option A says "provided that the legislative intent was not to make the purchase a criminal offense." But the statute's intent is clear; it's about sale, not purchase. So she's not guilty, so A would be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is F, but F says she was unaware of the statute. But strict liability doesn't require knowledge, so F isn't correct.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me approach this differently.

Strict liability means that the prosecution only needs to prove that the defendant committed the prohibited act. Here, the prohibited act is selling to a minor. The defendant didn't sell; she bought. So she didn't commit the act prohibited by the statute. Therefore, she's not guilty.

So the correct answer is A, B, C, E, or F? No, those options are about various defenses, but the main point is she didn't commit the prohibited act.

Wait, but the options don't have an option that says "not guilty because she didn't commit the prohibited act." So perhaps the closest is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is not guilty because she didn't have the intent, but that's option C, which is incorrect because strict liability doesn't require intent.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is I: guilty because her age makes her strictly liable. But that's only if the statute applies to her, which it doesn't because she's the buyer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe the statute's wording includes both selling and purchasing. Let me re-read the question.

Question says the statute prohibits the sale to any person under 17. So selling is prohibited. It says nothing about purchasing.

So the defendant, as the buyer, didn't violate the statute. Therefore, she's not guilty.

Looking back at the options, the only options that say not guilty are A, B, C, E, F.

So which one applies.

Option A: Not guilty, provided legislative intent wasn't to make purchase criminal. Since the statute doesn't criminalize purchase, she's not guilty regardless of intent. So the condition in A is met, making her not guilty.

But wait, the legislative intent is clear from the statute's wording. So even if the legislative intent was to criminalize purchase, but the statute doesn't say that, then she's not guilty. So A's condition is automatically satisfied because the statute doesn't criminalize purchase.

So the answer is A.

Wait, but another thought: the defendant didn't actually purchase because she didn't complete the sale. So perhaps she's not guilty because the sale wasn't completed.

But the question says she left the money and took the gun. So depending on the jurisdiction, that could be considered theft by shoplifting or something else. But the question is about the gun statute, not theft.

So under the gun statute, she didn't sell; she tried to buy, but the statute doesn't prohibit buying. So she's not guilty under this statute.

Therefore, the answer is A.

But wait, looking at the options again, option I says guilty because her age makes her strictly liable. But that's only if the statute applies to her, which it doesn't.

So I think the correct answer is A.

The question revolves around a state statute that prohibits the sale of guns and ammunition to anyone under the age of 17. This is a strict liability offense, meaning intent is irrelevant, and the mere act of violating the statute is sufficient for culpability. The defendant, a 15-year-old, attempted to purchase a shotgun but did not complete the transaction through the cashier, instead leaving the money and taking the shotgun. The issue is whether she can be found guilty under this statute.

The statute explicitly prohibits the sale to minors, which implies that the liability is on the seller, not the buyer. The defendant, as the buyer, did not engage in the prohibited act of selling, and the statute does not criminalize the act of purchasing by minors. Therefore, she did not violate the statute. Strict liability applies only to the act prohibited by the statute, which in this case is the sale, not the purchase.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Correct. The legislative intent, as reflected in the statute's wording, was not to criminalize the purchase of guns by minors but to prohibit the sale by sellers. Thus, the defendant is not guilty.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Strict liability does not consider whether the defendant believed the gun was a toy.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Strict liability does not require criminal intent, so the absence of intent is irrelevant.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The statute does not address how the sale is conducted, only that a sale to a minor is prohibited.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. Returning the shotgun is irrelevant under strict liability.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Strict liability does not depend on the defendant's knowledge of the statute.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The statute does not criminalize purchasing by minors, only selling to them.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The statute does not address the manner of the transaction, only the act of selling.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. Strict liability applies to the seller, not the buyer, based on the statute's wording.

The correct answer is **A**, as the statute does not criminalize the purchase of guns by minors, and the defendant did not engage in the prohibited act of selling. 

Answer: A
