Okay, so I've got this problem here about Mr. Fuller wanting to put fencing around his rectangular yard. Hmm, I remember that when you're fencing a rectangle, you need to calculate the perimeter because that's the total length around the edge. 

Alright, let's see. The yard is rectangular, right? So the opposite sides are equal. The width is 55 feet and the length is 75 feet. Wait, so there are two widths and two lengths. 

I think the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2*(length + width). Yeah, that sounds right. So let me plug in the numbers. 

So length is 75 and width is 55. Adding those together, 75 + 55 equals 130. Then multiply by 2 because there are two of each side. 130 * 2 is 260. 

So the total fencing needed should be 260 feet. Let me look at the options. Option D is 260, so that must be the correct answer. 

I don't think I made any mistakes here. It's a straightforward perimeter problem. Just add the two dimensions and double it. Yep, that makes sense.

The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated using the formula \( P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \). Given the length is 75 feet and the width is 55 feet, the calculation is:

\[
P = 2 \times (75 + 55) = 2 \times 130 = 260 \, \text{feet}.
\]

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

D: 260
