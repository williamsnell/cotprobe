Okay, so I've got this problem about Rayleigh scattering and the ratio of intensities for two hydrogen lines. Hmm, I'm trying to remember what I learned about Rayleigh scattering. I think it's the scattering of light by particles much smaller than the wavelength of the light. And the key point is that the intensity of the scattered light is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength. Oh right, the formula is I proportional to 1/λ^4.

So the question gives me two wavelengths: λ1 is 410 nm and λ2 is 656 nm. I need to find the ratio of their intensities. Wait, wait, actually, Rayleigh scattering is about how much light is scattered, so the intensity ratio would be based on their wavelengths. 

Wait, but which one is which? Let me think. The formula says I is proportional to 1/λ^4. So the shorter wavelength should have higher intensity because 1 over a smaller number (λ^4) is a bigger number. So λ1 is shorter than λ2, so I1 should be greater than I2. So the ratio I1/I2 should be (λ2/λ1)^4, because since I ∝ 1/λ^4, then I1/I2 = (λ2^4)/(λ1^4) = (λ2/λ1)^4.

Wait, wait, no. Let me make it clear. Let's say I1 is proportional to 1/(λ1)^4, and I2 proportional to 1/(λ2)^4. So the ratio I1/I2 is [1/(λ1^4)]/[1/(λ2^4)] = (λ2^4)/(λ1^4) = (λ2/λ1)^4. Because when you take the ratio of I1 to I2, it's (I1/I2) = (λ2^4)/(λ1^4).

So, substituting the numbers. λ1 is 410 nm, λ2 is 656 nm. So λ2/λ1 is 656/410. Let me calculate that. 656 divided by 410. Hmm, 410 times 1.6 is 656. Because 410 * 1.6 = 656 (since 400 *1.6=640, 10*1.6=16 → 640+16=656). So λ2/λ1 = 1.6.

So the ratio of intensities is (1.6)^4. Let me compute 1.6^4. 1.6 squared is 2.56. Then 2.56 squared is... let's calculate 2.56 * 2.56. 

2 * 2 =4. 2 *0.56=1.12. 0.56*2=1.12. 0.56*0.56=0.3136. So adding all together: 4 + 1.12 + 1.12 + 0.3136 = 6.5536. So (1.6)^4 = 6.5536 approximately. So the ratio I1/I2 is about 6.55 to 1.

Looking at the options, option J is 6.55:1. So the answer should be J.

Wait, wait, but wait another thing. The question says "ratio of intensities", and the way the options are presented, I need to make sure I'm choosing the right one. So I1 is at 410 nm, I2 at 656. So I1/I2 is about 6.55, which would be option J. So yes, J is the correct answer.

The problem involves calculating the ratio of intensities of Rayleigh scattering for two hydrogen lines with wavelengths \(\lambda_1 = 410 \, \text{nm}\) and \(\lambda_2 = 656 \, \text{nm}\). Rayleigh scattering intensity is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength, i.e., \(I \propto 1/\lambda^4\). The ratio of intensities is given by:

\[
\frac{I_1}{I_2} = \left(\frac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1}\right)^4
\]

Substituting the given wavelengths:

\[
\frac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1} = \frac{656}{410} \approx 1.6
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{I_1}{I_2} = (1.6)^4
\]

Calculating \(1.6^4\):

\[
1.6^2 = 2.56, \quad 2.56^2 = 6.5536
\]

Therefore, the ratio of intensities is approximately \(6.55:1\). Among the given options, the closest match is:

**J: 6.55:1**
