Okay, so I've got this problem here about the vapor pressure of scandium using the Knudseneffusion technique. Hmm, I remember that Knudsen's method is used for measuring the vapor pressure of substances, especially when it's low. The setup involves a small orifice through which vapor effuses, and by measuring the weight loss over time, you can calculate the vapor pressure. 

The given data includes temperature (1555.4 K), time (110.5 min), weight loss (9.57 mg), and the diameter of the orifice (0.2965 cm). I think I need to use the Knudsen equation here. Let me recall what the equation looks like.

From what I remember, the Knudsen equation relates the mass loss to the vapor pressure. The formula is something like:

P = ( (mass loss * sqrt(M)) ) / (A * t * sqrt(R*T / (2π)) )

Wait, no, maybe I got some parts wrong. Or was it based on the effusion rate? Oh right, the formula for vapor pressure P is given by:

P = (m * sqrt(M)) / (A * t * sqrt(2 * π * R * T))

But I need to make sure about the exact formula. Another thought: the effusion equation is derived from kinetic theory. The effusion rate is (P * A) / sqrt(2 π m' k T), where m' is the mass of a molecule. But since m' = M/(N_A), where M is molar mass and N_A Avogadro's number.

Wait, let me think again. The formula I found in my notes before was P = ( (Δm) * sqrt(M) ) / ( A * t * sqrt(2 * π * R * T) )

Yes, that's it. Where:
- Δm is the mass loss (in grams, I think)
- M is the molar mass (g/mol)
- A is the area of the orifice (cm²)
- t is time in seconds
- R is the gas constant, but I'm not sure which units.
- T is temperature in Kelvin.

Wait, but I need to check the units for all these variables to make sure everything lines up.

So let's break it down step by step.

First, calculate the area of the orifice. The diameter is given as 0.2965 cm, so radius is half of that, which is 0.14825 cm. Area A is π r². Let's compute that.

r = 0.2965 / 2 = 0.14825 cm. So A = π * (0.14825)^2 cm². Let me compute that numerically.

But wait, let's compute it precisely. 0.14825 squared is approximately (0.14825)^2 = 0.022 cm² (since 0.14^2 is 0.0196, 0.148^2 is about 0.0219, so 0.022). Multiplying by π gives roughly 0.0695 cm². Wait, but I should do it more accurately.

Wait, 0.14825^2: 0.148 * 0.148 = 0.021904. So 0.14825^2 is about 0.021904 cm². Then A = π * 0.021904 ≈ 0.0688 cm².

Wait, but let me compute it exactly. 0.14825 squared is (0.14825)^2. Let me calculate:

0.14825 * 0.14825:

Compute 14825 * 14825 first, ignoring the decimals for a moment.

Wait, that's a bit tedious. Alternatively, 0.14825 cm is 1.4825 mm, but maybe it's better to just compute it as:

(0.14825)^2 = (0.1 + 0.04 + 0.00825)^2? Hmm, perhaps using exact calculation:

0.14825 * 0.14825:

= (0.1 + 0.04825)^2
= 0.1² + 2*(0.1)*(0.04825) + (0.04825)^2
= 0.01 + 0.00965 + 0.0023300625
= 0.01 + 0.00965 = 0.01965, plus 0.00233 is 0.02198 approximately. So 0.02198 cm².

Then A = π * 0.02198 ≈ 3.1416 * 0.02198 ≈ 0.0689 cm².

Wait, let me check on calculator: 0.02198 * 3.1416 ≈ 0.0689 cm². So A≈0.0689 cm².

Next, the mass loss Δm is 9.57 mg. That's 0.00957 grams.

The molar mass M of scandium. Scandium has an atomic weight of about 44.96 g/mol. So M = 44.96 g/mol.

Time t is 110.5 minutes. I need to convert that into seconds because the formula uses seconds. So 110.5 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 6630 seconds.

Now, R is the gas constant. I think in this context, R is 8.314 J/mol·K, but I'm not sure because sometimes other units are used. Wait, let me think about the units in the formula.

Looking at the formula P = (Δm * sqrt(M)) / (A * t * sqrt(2 * π * R * T)) )

Wait, the units for each part:

Δm is in grams. M is in g/mol. So sqrt(M) is sqrt(g/mol).

But let me think about the units of each term.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is written with R in different units. Maybe using R as 8.314 J/(mol·K), but let me check the units.

Wait, the denominator is A (cm²) * t (seconds) * sqrt(2 π R T / (Molar_mass)).

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me think again.

Another approach: The Knudsen equation for effusion is given by:

P = (Δm * sqrt(M)) / (A * t * sqrt(2 * π * R * T))

Wait, but perhaps I should check the correct formula again. Maybe it's:

P = ( (Δm) * sqrt( M ) ) / ( A * t * sqrt( 2 * π * R * T ) )

Yes, that's what I have. So I can proceed.

Now, R is the gas constant. But in which units? Because R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), but 1 J = 1 kg·m²/s². So let's see:

M is in g/mol = 0.04496 kg/mol? No, wait, no. M is in g/mol, and R is in J/(mol·K), which is (kg·m²/s²)/(mol·K).

Wait, perhaps it's better to convert R into cm·atm units, but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe I should make sure all units are in CGS (centimeter-gram-second) units. Because the area is in cm², time in seconds, mass in grams.

In CGS units, R is 8.314×10^7 erg/(mol·K), since 1 J = 10^7 erg. So R = 8.314e7 erg/(mol·K). But 1 erg is 1 g·cm²/s². So R is 8.314e7 (g·cm²)/(s²·mol·K).

Wait, but I'm getting bogged down. Maybe I should proceed and see if the units work out.

Let me plug in the numbers and see.

So, let's compute each part step by step.

First, compute Δm * sqrt(M):

Δm = 0.00957 g
M = 44.96 g/mol
sqrt(M) = sqrt(44.96) ≈ 6.704 g^0.5/mol^0.5

So Δm * sqrt(M) = 0.00957 g * 6.704 g^0.5/mol^0.5
= 0.00957 * 6.704 ≈ 0.06417 (g^(3/2) mol^(-1/2))

Wait, but maybe I should think about the units again. Because when I multiply grams by sqrt(g/mol), the units become g^(3/2) mol^(-1/2), which is (g^(3) mol^-1 )^(1/2). Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Let's proceed numerically.

Next, compute the denominator: A * t * sqrt( 2 * π * R * T )

A is 0.0689 cm².

t is 6630 seconds.

Now, compute sqrt(2 * π * R * T )

R is 8.314 J/mol·K. Wait, but I'm working in CGS units, so I should convert R into cm³·atm/(mol·K) or similar. Or maybe another approach.

Alternatively, I can use R = 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), but that's in different units. Wait, maybe I should recast the formula to use R in L·atm/(mol·K) units.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. Another source I recall mentions that the Knudsen equation can be written as:

P (atm) = ( (Δm * sqrt(M)) ) / ( A * t * sqrt( 2 * π * R * T ) ) * conversion factors.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the correct formula with proper units. Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula as:

P = (Δm * sqrt(M)) / (A * t) * (1 / sqrt(2 * π * R * T)) )

But to make sure the units work out, let's consider each term's units.

Δm is in grams (g).

M is in g/mol, so sqrt(M) is sqrt(g/mol).

A is in cm².

t is in seconds.

R is in J/(mol·K) → which is (kg·m²/s²)/(mol·K) → which is (g·cm²/s²)/(mol·K), since 1 m² = 10^4 cm², 1 kg = 10^3 g, so 1 J = 10^3 g * 10^4 cm² / s² = 10^7 g·cm²/s². So R = 8.314 J/(mol·K) is 8.314e7 g·cm²/(s²·mol·K).

T is in Kelvin.

So putting it all together:

Numerator: (g) * sqrt(g/mol) → sqrt(g^2/mol) ) → (g^(3/2) )/(sqrt(mol)).

Denominator: (cm²) * (seconds) * sqrt( (g·cm²/(s²·mol·K)) * K )

Let me compute the units inside the sqrt:

(g·cm²/(s²·mol·K)) * K → (g·cm²)/(s²·mol)

So sqrt( (g·cm²)/(s²·mol) ) → sqrt(g·cm²/(s²·mol)) ) → (g^(1/2) cm )/(s * sqrt(mol)) )

Putting it all together, the denominator is:

cm² * s * [ (g^(1/2) cm )/(s * sqrt(mol)) ) ] → (cm² * s ) * (g^0.5 cm ) ) / (s * sqrt(mol)) )

Simplify:

cm² * s * g^0.5 cm / (s sqrt(mol)) ) → (cm^3 * g^0.5 s ) / (s sqrt(mol)) )

The s cancels. cm^3 is (cm^2 * cm). So:

cm^2 * cm * g^0.5 / sqrt(mol) → cm^3 * g^0.5 / sqrt(mol)

So the denominator's units are cm^3 * g^0.5 / sqrt(mol).

Wait, the numerator was g^(3/2) / sqrt(mol), and denominator is cm^3 * sqrt(g) / sqrt(mol).

So overall, the units become:

(numerator) / (denominator) → [ (g^(3/2) / sqrt(mol)) ] / [ cm^3 * sqrt(g) / sqrt(mol) ) ] 

The sqrt(mol) cancels. sqrt(g) is g^(1/2). So:

g^(3/2) / ( cm^3 * g^(1/2) ) ) → g^( (3/2 - 1/2) ) / cm^3 → g / cm^3.

Wait, because (3/2 - 1/2) = 1. So units are (g)/(cm^3).

But pressure is in atm, and 1 atm is 1.01325e6 dynes/cm². Wait, maybe I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and should instead use the formula with appropriate unit conversions.

Wait, another approach: Let's make sure all units are in CGS. Let me look up the correct expression.

Wait, I found a source that says the formula is:

P = ( (Δm) * sqrt(M) ) / ( A * t * sqrt( 2 * π * R * T ) )

But in CGS units, R is 8.314e7 erg/(mol·K). So let's compute each part.

Wait, another source I found says that the formula is:

P = (m * sqrt(M)) / (A * t * sqrt(2 * π * R * T))

where:
- m is mass loss in grams,
- M is molar mass (g/mol),
- A is orifice area (cm²),
- t is time (seconds),
- R is 8.314e7 erg/(mol·K),
- T is temperature (K),
- P is vapor pressure in dynes/cm².

Then, to convert P from dynes/cm² to atm, we can use 1 atm = 1.01325e6 dynes/cm².

So let me proceed with this approach.

Compute each part:

Compute the numerator: m * sqrt(M) = 0.00957 g * sqrt(44.96 g/mol) ≈ 0.00957 * 6.704 ≈ 0.06417 g^(3/2)·mol^(-1/2)

Denominator: A * t * sqrt(2 * π * R * T)

A = 0.0689 cm²
t = 6630 s

Compute 2 * π * R * T:

R = 8.314e7 erg/(mol·K)
T = 1555.4 K

2 * π = ~6.2832
So 2πRT = 6.2832 * 8.314e7 * 1555.4

Let me compute that:

First, compute 8.314e7 * 1555.4 → 8.314e7 * 1.5554e3 = ?

8.314e7 * 1.5554e3 = 8.314 * 1.5554 * 1e10 → Let's compute 8.314 * 1.5554.

8 * 1.5554 = 12.4432
0.314 * 1.5554 ≈ 0.314*1.5=0.471, 0.314*0.0554≈0.0174 → total ≈0.4884
Total ≈12.4432 + 0.4884 ≈12.9316

So 8.314e7 * 1.5554e3 ≈12.9316e10 → 1.29316e11 erg/mol.

Multiply by 6.2832 (2π):

6.2832 * 1.29316e11 ≈ let's compute 6 * 1.29316e11 =7.758e11, 0.2832*1.29316e11≈3.66e10 → total≈8.1148e11 erg/mol.

So sqrt(2πRT) = sqrt(8.1148e11 erg/mol) → sqrt(8.1148e11) ≈ 2.848e5 sqrt(erg/mol).

Wait, but 1 erg = 1 g·cm²/s², so sqrt(erg/mol) is sqrt(g·cm²/(s²·mol)).

So sqrt(2πRT) = 2.848e5 sqrt(erg/mol) → 2.848e5 (g·cm/(s·sqrt(mol))) )

Wait, perhaps better to proceed with the numbers.

So denominator becomes:

A * t * sqrt(2πRT) = 0.0689 cm² * 6630 s * 2.848e5 (sqrt(erg/mol)).

Wait, but let me compute the product:

0.0689 * 6630 ≈ 456.0 (cm²·s)

Then multiply by 2.848e5 → 456 * 2.848e5 ≈ 1.299e8 cm²·s·sqrt(erg/mol).

Hmm, but I'm not sure about the units here. Let's proceed numerically.

So denominator ≈1.299e8 (cm²·s·sqrt(erg/mol)).

Wait, but the numerator is 0.06417 g^(3/2)·mol^(-1/2).

So P = numerator / denominator = 0.06417 / 1.299e8 → approximately 4.935e-8 (g^(3/2)·mol^(-1/2)) / (cm²·s·sqrt(erg/mol)) )

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should instead proceed with the numbers and then convert the pressure from dynes/cm² to atm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula as:

P = (m * sqrt(M)) / (A * t) * 1/(sqrt(2 * π * R * T)) )

But regardless, perhaps I should just compute the numerical value.

Let me compute sqrt(2 * π * R * T):

R = 8.314e7 erg/(mol·K)
T = 1555.4 K
So 2 * π * R * T = 2 * 3.1416 * 8.314e7 * 1555.4

Compute 2 * π ≈6.2832.

6.2832 * 8.314e7 ≈ 6.2832 * 8.314e7 =
