Okay, so I've got this problem here about the half-life of radon, and I need to figure out after how many days only one-sixteenth of the sample remains. Hmm, I remember that half-life is the time it takes for half of a radioactive substance to decay. But wait, how do I approach this when it's not just one half-life but multiple?

So the half-life is given as 3.80 days. I think the formula I need is the one that relates the remaining quantity to the number of half-lives. Oh right, the formula is N(t) = N0 * (1/2)^(t / t_half), where N(t) is the remaining amount, N0 is the initial amount, t is time, and t_half is the half-life.

In this problem, N(t) is one-sixteenth of the original, so N(t)/N0 = 1/16. I need to find t when this ratio is 1/16. Let me plug that into the formula.

So 1/16 = (1/2)^(t / 3.80). Hmm, I'm not too sure about solving exponents here. Wait, I think taking the natural logarithm of both sides might help. Or maybe using logarithms in general.

Let me rewrite the equation: (1/2)^(t / 3.80) = 1/16. Taking the natural log of both sides, ln( (1/2)^(t/3.80) ) = ln(1/16). Using log properties, that's (t/3.80) * ln(1/2) = ln(1/16).

Wait, I remember that ln(1/a) is -ln(a), so I can write this as (t/3.80)*(-ln(2)) = -ln(16). The negatives on both sides cancel out, so t/3.80 * ln(2) = ln(16).

But wait, 16 is 2 to the 4th power. So ln(16) is ln(2^4) which is 4 ln(2). So substituting that in, we get t/3.80 * ln(2) = 4 ln(2).

Oh, wait, the ln(2) terms on both sides can be canceled out. So t/3.80 = 4. Then multiply both sides by 3.80 to get t = 4 * 3.80.

Wait, 4 times 3.80 is 15.2 days. So the time taken is 15.2 days. Let me check the options. Option H is 15.2 days. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me think again. One half-life is 3.8 days. After each half-life, the amount halves. So after 1 half-life (3.8 days), it's 1/2. After 2 half-lives (7.6 days), it's 1/4. 3 half-lives (11.4 days) is 1/8. 4 half-lives (15.2 days) is 1/16. Yes that makes sense. So the answer is H.

To determine how many days it will take for one-sixteenth of a radon sample to remain, we use the formula for radioactive decay:

\[
N(t) = N_0 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\frac{t}{t_{\text{half}}}}
\]

Here, \( N(t)/N_0 = 1/16 \), and the half-life \( t_{\text{half}} = 3.80 \, \text{days} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{1}{16} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\frac{t}{3.80}}
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{16}\right) = \ln\left(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\frac{t}{3.80}}\right)
\]

Using the property of logarithms, \( \ln(a^b) = b \cdot \ln(a) \):

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{16}\right) = \frac{t}{3.80} \cdot \ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)
\]

Since \( \ln\left(\frac{1}{16}\right) = -\ln(16) \) and \( \ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = -\ln(2) \), the equation becomes:

\[
-\ln(16) = \frac{t}{3.80} \cdot -\ln(2)
\]

Canceling the negatives and noting that \( \ln(16) = \ln(2^4) = 4 \cdot \ln(2) \):

\[
4 \cdot \ln(2) = \frac{t}{3.80} \cdot \ln(2)
\]

Canceling \( \ln(2) \) from both sides:

\[
4 = \frac{t}{3.80}
\]

Solving for \( t \):

\[
t = 4 \cdot 3.80 = 15.2 \, \text{days}
\]

Thus, after 15.2 days, only one-sixteenth of the radon sample remains. The correct answer is:

**H: 15.2 days**
