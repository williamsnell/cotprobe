Okay, so I have this question about wet-bulb thermometers and relative humidity. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says that the wet-bulb thermometer reads 65°F when the air is at atmospheric pressure and the dry-bulb temperature is 95°F. I need to find the relative humidity. I remember that wet-bulb thermometers are used in psychrometry to determine humidity levels.

Wait, I think the wet-bulb temperature is lower than the dry-bulb because of evaporation. When air moves over the wet bulb, it causes the water to evaporate, which cools the bulb. So the wet bulb is always lower unless the air is already saturated (100% humidity).

I recall there's a formula or maybe a psychrometric chart that relates these temperatures to relative humidity. I'm not exactly sure of the formula, so maybe I should think about the psychrometric chart approach.

From what I remember, on a psychrometric chart, you can plot the dry-bulb temperature and the wet-bulb temperature to find the relative humidity. The dry-bulb is on the x-axis, and the wet-bulb is somewhere below it, depending on the humidity.

So the given values are Tdry = 95°F and Twet = 65°F. I need to find RH. 

Wait, maybe I can use the formula for relative humidity in terms of wet and dry bulb temperatures. I think the formula is RH = (Pw/Ps) * 100, where Pw is the partial pressure of water vapor in the air and Ps is the saturation pressure at the dry bulb temperature.

But how do I find Pw? Oh right, using the wet-bulb temperature. The wet-bulb temperature is related to the dew point, which is the saturation temperature of the water vapor in the air. So the wet bulb gives us the dew point temperature, Tdew.

Wait, no, that's not exactly right. The wet-bulb temperature is actually a bit more complicated because it's affected by air movement and other factors. But in this case, I think the question is simplified so that Twet is the dew point. Or maybe it's using the approximation that the wet bulb is close to the dew point under certain conditions.

Alternatively, I think there's an equation that relates the wet and dry bulb temperatures to the humidity. Let me try to remember. Oh, I think it's the equation for the wet bulb:

Tw = Tdry - ( (Tdry - Tdew) ) * ( (1 - RH) )

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Maybe I'm mixing things up. Another approach is to use the psychrometric formula which relates the wet-bulb depression (the difference between dry and wet bulb temperatures) to the humidity.

Wait, I think the formula is: RH = (Ps(Twet) / Ps(Tdry)) * exp[ ( (Cp * (Tdry - Twet)) / (λ * Tdry) ) ]

Wait, no, that's more of the formula for the wet bulb in terms of the psychrometric parameters. Alternatively, I might be overcomplicating it.

Alternatively, I remember the approximation formula for RH when you have Tw and T. Maybe it's something like RH = 100 - ( (T - Tw) * 1.05 ), but I don't think that's correct because the numbers wouldn't line up with the options.

Wait, maybe I should think about using the psychrometric chart. Let's imagine the psychrometric chart. At a dry bulb temperature of 95°F, and wet bulb of 65°F, where would that point lie? The relative humidity is where the wet bulb line intersects with the dry bulb line.

Wait, but I don't have the exact chart here. Maybe I can use an online calculator or formula. Alternatively, perhaps there's a standard formula I can use.

Wait, I think the formula involves the wet bulb temperature and the dry bulb temperature. Let me try to recall the exact formula.

The relative humidity (RH) can be calculated using the following formula:

RH = (P_w / P_s) * 100%

Where P_w is the water vapor pressure and P_s is the saturated vapor pressure at the dry bulb temperature.

To find P_w, we can use the wet bulb temperature. The wet bulb temperature (Tw) relates to P_w via the saturation pressure at Tw.

Wait, no. Because the wet bulb isn't the dew point. The dew point is when the air is saturated. So, perhaps P_w = P_sat(Twet). Or is that the case?

Wait, no. The wet bulb temperature is the lowest temperature that can be reached by a thermometer wrapped in wet cloth and exposed to the air stream. It's related to the adiabatic saturation temperature. But I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula involving the wet bulb and dry bulb temperatures to find RH.

I found in my notes that the formula is:

RH = [ (Tdry - Twet) / ( (Tdry - Twet) + (158.3 * (1.8*Tdry + 32) ) ) ] * 100%

Wait, that doesn't seem familiar. Alternatively, I might be confusing it with the heat index formula.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the psychrometric chart equations. The formula for RH in terms of Tw and T can be derived from the psychrometric equations.

The psychrometric equation is:

(Tw - Tdew) = (Tw - Tdry) * ( (0.00001982 * P_atm) / ( (1 + 0.00001982 * P_atm) * λ ) )

Wait, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, the equation can be written as:

P_w = P_s(Tw) * exp( ( (Cp * (Tdry - Tw)) / (λ * Tdry) ) )

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should use the approximation formula for RH when you have the wet and dry bulb temperatures.

Wait, another approach: The wet bulb temperature (Tw) can be used to find the dew point temperature (Td). But I think Tw is not exactly Td; it's lower than Td because of the cooling effect.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should use an online calculator method, but since I can't do that right now, I'll try to proceed.

Let me try to think of the formula again. I think the relative humidity can be found using the following equation:

RH = ( (P_s(Tw) ) / P_s(Tdry) ) * 100%

But wait, that would be if the wet bulb gives the saturation pressure. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.

Alternatively, I think the formula is:

RH = ( (P_s(Tw) ) / P_s(Tdry) ) * 100%

But I'm not confident about this. Let me try to plug in some numbers.

I need the saturation pressures at Tw and Tdry. The saturation pressure can be found using the Antoine equation or some other approximation.

The Antoine equation is:

log10(P_sat) = A - (B / (T + C))

Where P_sat is in mmHg, and T is in °C.

Wait, the given temperatures are in Fahrenheit, so I need to convert them to Celsius.

First, convert the temperatures:

Tdry = 95°F → (95-32)*5/9 ≈ 35 °C

Twet = 65°F → (65-32)*5/9 ≈ 18.33 °C

Now, I can find P_s at each temperature.

But wait, I think the Antoine equation coefficients are specific for water. Let me recall the values:

For water, the Antoine equation constants from NIST are:

A = 8.14019

B = 1810.94

C = 244.485

And the equation is valid for T in °C from 1 to 100 °C.

So, for Tdry = 35°C,

log10(P_sat_dry) = 8.14019 - (1810.94 / (35 + 244.485)) 

= 8.14019 - (1810.94 / 279.485)

= 8.14019 - 6.481 ≈ 1.6592

So P_sat_dry = 10^1.6592 ≈ 45.7 mmHg.

Similarly, for Tw = 18.33°C,

log10(P_sat_wet) = 8.14019 - (1810.94 / (18.33 + 244.485))

= 8.14019 - (1810.94 / 262.815)

≈ 8.14019 - 6.894 ≈ 1.2462

So P_sat_wet = 10^1.2462 ≈ 17.55 mmHg.

Now, if the formula is RH = (P_sat_wet / P_sat_dry) * 100, then:

RH = (17.55 / 45.7) * 100 ≈ 38.4%

Looking at the options, the closest is option E: 38.6%. But let me double-check because I might have made a miscalculation.

Wait, the formula I used assumes that P_w = P_sat(Tw), which might not be correct. Because the wet bulb isn't the same as the dew point. So perhaps this approach isn't entirely accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is RH = (P_w / P_s(Tdry)) * 100, and P_w can be found using the wet bulb temperature with the psychrometric equation.

The psychrometric equation relates the wet bulb temperature to the humidity. The formula is:

P_w = P_s(Tw) - ( (P_atm - P_s(Tw)) * (Tdry - Tw) ) / (1584 - 1.3*(Tdry - Tw) )

Wait, I'm not sure. Another version I found is:

P_w = (P_s(Tw) * (P_atm - ( (P_atm - P_s(Tw)) * (Tdry - Tw) / (1531.5 + 1.2*(Tdry - Tw)) )) )) 

But I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should use an approximate method.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula:

RH = [ (P_s(Tw) ) / ( P_s(Tdry) ) ] * 100%

But I think that's an approximation only valid under certain conditions, maybe at lower humidities. Let's try that.

Earlier, I found P_s(Tdry=35°C)=45.7 mmHg, P_s(Tw=18.33°C)=17.55 mmHg.

So RH = (17.55/45.7)*100 ≈ 38.4% which matches option E (38.6%) but wait, let me check my calculations again.

Wait, let me recalculate the saturation pressures more accurately.

For Tdry=35°C:

log10(P_sat_dry) = 8.14019 - 1810.94/(35 + 244.485) 

= 8.14019 - 1810.94 / 279.485

Calculating 1810.94 / 279.485:

Let me do 279.485 * 6 = 1676.91, which is less than 1810.94. 279.485 *6.48= approx?

6 * 279.485=1676.91

0.48 * 279.485 ≈ 134.25

So 6.48 → 1676.91 + 134.25≈1811.16, which is about 1810.94.

So 279.485 * 6.48 ≈ 1811.16. So 1810.94/279.485≈6.48.

So log10(P_sat_dry)=8.14019 -6.48=1.66019.

So P_sat_dry = 10^1.66019 ≈ 45.9 mmHg.

Similarly, for Tw=18.33°C:

log10(P_sat_wet) =8.14019 - 1810.94/(18.33+244.485)=8.14019 - 1810.94/262.815.

Calculate 1810.94 / 262.815:

262.815 *6=1576.89

262.815 *6.8= 262.815*(6 +0.8)=1576.89 + 210.252=1787.142

But 262.815 *6.89= ?

6.8 →1787.142

0.09→23.64 (approx 0.09*262.815=23.64)

So 6.89 →1787.142+23.64≈1810.782. Which is very close to 1810.94.

So 1810.94/262.815≈6.89.

So log10(P_sat_wet)=8.14019 -6.89=1.25019 →10^1.25019≈17.78 mmHg.

So RH = (17.78 /45.9)*100≈38.78%.

But that's approximately 38.8%, but the options are A:26.1, B:34.5, E:38.6, etc. So 38.8% would be closest to E:38.6%. But I'm not 100% sure if this approximation is correct.

Wait, maybe I should use the psychrometric formula which is more accurate. The correct formula is:

P_w = ( P_atm * ( (Tdry - Tw) * 1.8 + 32 ) ) / ( 1584.7 - 1.3*(Tdry - Tw) )

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, the correct equation is:

P_w = P_s(Tw) * exp( ( (0.00001982 * P_atm) * (Tdry - Tw) ) / (1 + (0.00001982 * P_atm) ) )

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, the correct formula is:

Pw = ( ( (Tdry - Tw) * (1.8 * P_atm) ) / ( 1584.7 - 1.3*(Tdry - Tw) ) ) + P_s(Tw)

Wait, no, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should refer to the psychrometric chart formula.

Wait, I found that the formula relating wet bulb, dry bulb, and humidity is:

Tw = Tdry - ( ( (P_atm - P_s(Tdry)) * (Tdry - Tdew) ) / ( (P_atm - P_s(Tw)) * (Tdry - Tw) ) )

Wait, that's getting too complicated. Maybe I should use the approximation that RH = (P_sat(Tw) / P_sat(Tdry)) ) * 100, which gives around 38.6%, which is option E.

But looking at the options, option E is 38.6%, which is very close to my calculation of approximately 38.8%. So the correct answer should be option E.

To determine the relative humidity (RH) when the wet-bulb thermometer reads 65°F and the dry-bulb temperature is 95°F at atmospheric pressure, the following approach is used:

1. **Convert Temperatures to Celsius**:  
   - Dry-bulb temperature: \( T_{\text{dry}} = 95^\circ \text{F} \rightarrow 35^\circ \text{C} \)  
   - Wet-bulb temperature: \( T_{\text{wet}} = 65^\circ \text{F} \rightarrow 18.33^\circ \text{C} \).

2. **Calculate Saturation Pressures**:  
   Using the Antoine equation for water vapor:  
   \[
   \log_{10}(P_{\text{sat}}) = A - \frac{B}{T + C}
   \]  
   where \( A = 8.14019 \), \( B = 1810.94 \), and \( C = 244.485 \), and \( T \) is in °C:  
   - For \( T_{\text{dry}} = 35^\circ \text{C} \):  
     \[
     \log_{10}(P_{\text{sat,dry}}) = 8.14019 - \frac{1810.94}{35 + 244.485} \approx 1.66019 \implies P_{\text{sat,dry}} \approx 45.9 \, \text{mmHg}.
     \]  
   - For \( T_{\text{wet}} = 18.33^\circ \text{C} \):  
     \[
     \log_{10}(P_{\text{sat,wet}}) = 8.14019 - \frac{1810.94}{18.33 + 244.485} \approx 1.25019 \implies P_{\text{sat,wet}} \approx 17.78 \, \text{mmHg}.
     \]

3. **Calculate Relative Humidity**:  
   The relative humidity is approximated using the formula:  
   \[
   \text{RH} = \frac{P_{\text{sat,wet}}}{P_{\text{sat,dry}}} \times 100.
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   \text{RH} = \frac{17.78}{45.9} \times 100 \approx 38.8\%.
   \]

4. **Match to Closest Option**:  
   The calculated RH of 38.8% is closest to option **E: 38.6%**.

Thus, the relative humidity of the air stream is approximately **38.6%**.

Answer: E
