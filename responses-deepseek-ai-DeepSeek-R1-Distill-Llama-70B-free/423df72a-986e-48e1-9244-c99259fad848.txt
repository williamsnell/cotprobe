Okay, so I've got this problem here about George investing $500 into an account that earns 8% interest, compounded quarterly. He leaves it for five years, and I need to figure out how much he'll have. Hmm, I remember that compound interest has a formula, but wait, what's the formula again? Oh right, it's A equals P times (1 plus r over n) to the power of nt. Let me break that down.

So, A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest. P is the principal amount, which is the initial amount of money. r is the annual interest rate, decimal form. n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year. And t is the time in years.

In this case, George's principal P is $500. The rate r is 8%, so that's 0.08 as a decimal. It's compounded quarterly, so n should be 4 because there are four quarters in a year. The time t is 5 years.

Plugging these into the formula: A = 500 * (1 + 0.08/4)^(4*5). Let me compute that step by step.

First, calculate 0.08 divided by 4. 0.08 /4 is 0.02. Then, 1 plus 0.02 is 1.02. Next, the exponent is 4 times 5, which is 20. So now it's 500 multiplied by (1.02)^20.

Wait, I need to compute (1.02) to the power of 20. Hmm, I don't remember exactly what that is off the top of my head. Maybe I can approximate it or remember that 1.02^20 is a common value. I think it's around 1.485, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate it step by step.

Let me think. 1.02^2 is 1.0404. Then, 1.0404 squared is (1.02)^4, which would be approximately 1.08243216. Then, 1.08243216 squared is (1.02)^8, which I think is about 1.171659. Hmm, but I'm not sure if I'm doing that right. Alternatively, maybe I should use the rule of 72 or something else, but that's for doubling time.

Wait, perhaps I should just compute 1.02^20. Let me try calculating it more carefully. Let's see:

1.02^1 = 1.02
1.02^2 = 1.0404
1.02^3 = 1.061208
1.02^4 ≈ 1.08243216
1.02^5 ≈ 1.10408 (Wait, 1.08243216 * 1.02 = 1.08243216 + 0.02164864 = 1.1040808)
1.02^6 = 1.1040808 * 1.02 ≈ 1.12616
1.02^7 ≈ 1.14868
1.02^8 ≈ 1.171659
1.02^9 ≈ 1.19508
1.02^10 ≈ 1.2190 (since 1.19508 *1.02 is about 1.219)
Wait, but I'm getting a bit off track. Alternatively, perhaps I can just use a calculator method. Oh wait, I don't have a calculator here. Maybe I should think of another way.

Wait, I remember that (1.02)^20 is approximately 1.4852. So 500 * 1.4852 would be 500 * 1.4852. Let me calculate that. 500 times 1 is 500, 500 times 0.4 is 200, 500 times 0.08 is 40, 500 times 0.0052 is 2.6. So adding those up: 500 + 200 is 700, plus 40 is 740, plus 2.6 is 742.6. So approximately $742.60.

Looking at the options, option I is $742.97. That's close to my approximation. Wait, but maybe my (1.02)^20 is a bit off. Let me double-check that. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use logarithms or another method, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can use the rule of 72 to estimate. The rule says that at 2% per period, the doubling time is around 36 periods. But since we're compounding quarterly, each period is a quarter, so 20 periods would be 5 years. So with 2% each quarter, 20 periods: 500 would grow to more than double, but I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute (1.02)^20 more accurately. Let me try that.

I'll compute step by step:

Start with 1.02

1. 1.02^1 = 1.02

2. 1.02^2 = 1.02 * 1.02 = 1.0404

3. 1.02^3 = 1.0404 * 1.02 = 1.061208

4. 1.02^4 = 1.061208 *1.02 = let's calculate that: 1.061208 * 1.02.

1.061208 * 1 = 1.061208

1.061208 * 0.02 = 0.02124316

Adding them gives 1.08245116

5. 1.02^5 = 1.08245116 *1.02.

Again, 1.08245116 *1 = 1.08245116

1.08245116 *0.02 = 0.0216490232

Total: 1.1041001832 ≈ 1.10410018

6. 1.02^6 = 1.10410018 *1.02.

1.10410018 *1 = 1.10410018

1.10410018 *0.02 = 0.0220820036

Sum: 1.1261821836 ≈ 1.12618218

7. 1.02^7 = 1.12618218 *1.02.

1.12618218 *1 = 1.12618218

1.12618218 *0.02 = 0.0225236436

Sum: 1.1487058236 ≈ 1.14870582

8. 1.02^8 = 1.14870582 *1.02.

1.14870582 *1 = 1.14870582

1.14870582 *0.02 = 0.0229741164

Sum: 1.1716799364 ≈1.17168

9. 1.02^9 = 1.1716799364 *1.02.

1.1716799364 *1 = 1.1716799364

1.1716799364 *0.02 = 0.0234337987

Sum: 1.1951137351 ≈1.19511374

10. 1.02^10 = 1.19511374 *1.02.

1.19511374 *1 = 1.19511374

1.19511374 *0.02 = 0.0239022748

Sum: 1.2190160148 ≈1.219016

So after 10 quarters (2.5 years), it's about 1.219016.

Continuing:

11. 1.02^11 = 1.219016 *1.02.

1.219016 *1 = 1.219016

1.219016 *0.02 = 0.02438032

Sum: 1.24339632

12. 1.02^12 = 1.24339632 *1.02.

1.24339632 *1 = 1.24339632

1.24339632 *0.02 = 0.024867913

Sum: 1.268264233

13. 1.02^13 = 1.268264233 *1.02.

1.268264233 *1 = 1.268264233

1.268264233 *0.02 = 0.025365285

Sum: 1.293629518 ≈1.29363

14. 1.02^14 = 1.29363 *1.02.

1.29363 *1 = 1.29363

1.29363 *0.02 = 0.0258726

Sum: 1.3195026 ≈1.3195

15. 1.02^15 = 1.3195 *1.02.

1.3195 *1 =1.3195

1.3195 *0.02=0.02639

Sum:1.34589

16. 1.02^16=1.34589*1.02.

1.34589 *1 =1.34589

1.34589 *0.02=0.0269178

Sum:1.3728078

17. 1.02^17=1.3728078 *1.02.

1.3728078 *1=1.3728078

1.3728078 *0.02=0.027456156

Sum:1.40026396

18. 1.02^18=1.40026396*1.02.

1.40026396 *1 =1.40026396

1.40026396 *0.02=0.028005279

Sum:1.42826924

19. 1.02^19=1.42826924 *1.02.

1.42826924 *1 =1.42826924

1.42826924 *0.02=0.0285653848

Sum:1.4568346248

20. 1.02^20=1.4568346248 *1.02.

1.4568346248 *1=1.4568346248

1.4568346248 *0.02=0.0291366925

Sum:1.4859713173 ≈1.48597

So (1.02)^20 ≈1.48597. So the amount A = 500 * 1.48597 = ?

Let me compute that. 500 * 1.48597.

Well, 500 *1 =500, 500 *0.4 is 200, 500 *0.08 is 40, 500 *0.00597 is about 2.985.

Adding those up: 500 +200=700, +40=740, +2.985=742.985. So approximately $742.985, which is about $743.

Looking at the options, option I is $742.97. That's very close, so I think that's the correct answer. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponentials. Let me see: when I calculated step 20, I got 1.48597, which when multiplied by 500 gives 742.985. But option I is 742.97, which is about the same. The slight difference might be due to rounding during the calculation steps. So the correct answer should be I: $742.97.

To calculate how much George will have after 5 years with an initial investment of $500 at an annual interest rate of 8%, compounded quarterly, we use the compound interest formula:

\[
A = P \cdot \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}
\]

Where:
- \( P = 500 \) (principal amount),
- \( r = 0.08 \) (annual interest rate),
- \( n = 4 \) (compounded quarterly),
- \( t = 5 \) (time in years).

First, calculate the quarterly interest rate:

\[
\frac{r}{n} = \frac{0.08}{4} = 0.02
\]

Next, calculate the total number of compounding periods:

\[
nt = 4 \cdot 5 = 20
\]

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[
A = 500 \cdot \left(1 + 0.02\right)^{20} = 500 \cdot (1.02)^{20}
\]

To compute \( (1.02)^{20} \), we approximate it as \( 1.48597 \). Thus:

\[
A = 500 \cdot 1.48597 = 742.985
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, the final amount is approximately \( \$742.97 \).

From the given options, the closest match is:

**I: $742.97**
