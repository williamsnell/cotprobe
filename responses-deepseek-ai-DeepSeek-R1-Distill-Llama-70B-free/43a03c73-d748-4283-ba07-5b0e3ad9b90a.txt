Okay, I've got this thermodynamics problem here about water in a cylinder. Let's see what it's asking.

So, the problem says: A cylinder contains 3 pounds of saturated liquid water at a constant pressure of 30 psia. It's heated until the quality of the mixture is 70 percent. I need to find three things: a) the initial temperature, b) the final pressure and temperature, and c) the volume change of the mixture.

Hmm. Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, part a: the initial temperature. Since the water is a saturated liquid at 30 psia, I remember that the saturation temperature depends on the pressure. I probably need to look up the saturation temperature for water at 30 psia.

I think I remember that at 30 psi above atmospheric (which is 30 psia), the saturation temperature is around 250-something degrees Fahrenheit. Let me think. Oh wait, I think it's approximately 250°F. Or maybe a bit higher? I should double-check this. Alternatively, maybe it's 260°F? Wait, no, 30 psia isn't that high. At 14.7 psia, it's 212°F, so 30 psia is higher pressure, so higher temperature. So maybe around 260°F? Or perhaps 265°F? Hmm. Wait, I think it's about 260.5°F because I recall that at 30 psia, the saturation temp is 260.5°F. Or was that at 40 psia? Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think: standard steam tables. At 30 psia, the saturation temperature is about 250°F? Or maybe it's 248°F? Oh, wait, I think it might be 250.34°F. Hmm. Wait, maybe the correct value is around 250°F. I'll need to get back to this after I think through the other parts.

Moving on to part b: the final pressure and temperature. Wait, the process is at constant pressure. So when the problem says the cylinder is heated until the quality is 70%, the pressure remains at 30 psia. Because the process occurs at constant pressure. So the pressure doesn't change. So the final pressure is still 30 psia. And since the pressure remains the same, the temperature should stay the same as the initial temperature because it's a saturated mixture. Wait, is that right? Because for a saturated liquid-vapor mixture at a given pressure, the temperature is fixed. So whether it's 0% quality (all liquid) or 100% quality (all vapor), the temperature remains the same as the saturation temperature at that pressure.

So if the initial temperature was, say, 250.34°F at 30 psia, then after heating to 70% quality, the temperature is still 250.34°F, and pressure remains 30 psia. So part b would be 30 psia and 250.34°F.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check. For option J, part a is 250.34°F, part b is 30 psia and same temperature. Option F says 260.5°F, which would be if the pressure were higher. So perhaps J is the correct option.

Then part c: the volume change. Hmm. The volume change of the mixture. So initially, the volume is V_initial = mass * specific volume. Since it's saturated liquid at 30 psia, the specific volume is v_f. After heating, it's a mixture with quality x=70%, so the specific volume is v = v_f + x*(v_g - v_f).

Wait, so the mass is 3 lbm. So initial volume: m*(v_f) at 30 psia. Final volume: m*(v_f + x*(v_g - v_f)).

But wait, if pressure is constant, then v_f and v_g are the same at 30 psia for both initial and final states. So the volume will increase because the specific volume increases with quality.

So I need to find v_f and v_g at 30 psia.

Looking up steam tables at 30 psia (I think in the saturation table), v_f is around 0.0177 ft³/lbm, and v_g is about 26.8 ft³/lbm. Wait, or was that 30 psia? Let me think. At lower pressures, v_g is larger. Wait, no, higher pressure reduces v_g. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps at 30 psia, v_f is about 0.0177, and v_g is about 26.8? Or maybe 24.8? Wait, let me think. At 14.7 psia (atmospheric), v_g is about 26.8, but at higher pressures, v_g decreases. So at 30 psia, v_g would be less than 26.8.

Wait, I think at 30 psia, v_f is about 0.01772 ft³/lbm, and v_g is approximately 24.78 ft³/lbm. So the specific volume of the mixture at x=0.7 would be v = 0.01772 + 0.7*(24.78 - 0.01772) = 0.01772 + 0.7*(24.76228) ≈ 0.01772 + 17.3336 ≈ 17.3513 ft³/lbm.

So the total volume V_final = m * v = 3 lbm * 17.3513 ft³/lbm ≈ 52.0539 ft³.

Wait, but the initial volume is V_initial = m * v_f = 3 * 0.01772 ≈ 0.05316 ft³. So the change in volume is V_final - V_initial ≈ 52.0539 - 0.05316 ≈ 52.0007 ft³? That seems like a huge change. But wait, that can't be right because the options don't have anything like that. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm confusing pounds-mass with pounds-force. Wait, no, specific volume is in ft³ per lbm. So 3 lbm times specific volume in ft³/lbm gives ft³.

Wait, but the options give volume changes around 30 ft³. So my calculation must be wrong. What did I do wrong here?

Wait, perhaps I took v_g at a different pressure. Let me think again. Maybe at 30 psia, v_g is smaller. Let me double-check the steam tables in my head.

At 30 psia, saturation temperature is about 250.34°F. The specific volumes are:

v_f = 0.017734 ft³/lbm,

v_g = 24.783 ft³/lbm.

So, for x=0.7,

v = 0.017734 + 0.7*(24.783 - 0.017734) = 0.017734 + 0.7*(24.765266) = 0.017734 + 17.3357 ≈ 17.3534 ft³/lbm.

So volume V = 3 * 17.3534 ≈ 52.06 ft³.

But initial volume is 3 * 0.017734 ≈ 0.0532 ft³. So the change is 52.06 - 0.0532 ≈ 52.0 ft³. But looking at the options, the highest volume change is 40 ft³ (option E). So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong approach. Maybe the question is asking for the change in volume, but perhaps the initial state is all liquid, and the final state is a mixture. So the change is V_final - V_initial = (v_f + x v_fg) * m - (v_f * m) = x * v_fg * m.

So for x=0.7, v_fg = v_g - v_f = 24.765 ft³/lbm.

So change in volume is 3 lbm * 0.7 * 24.765 ft³/lbm = 3 * 0.7 *24.765 = 2.1 *24.765 ≈ 52.00 ft³. Again, same result.

But the options don't have 52. So perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me check the steam table again. Maybe I have the wrong v_g for 30 psia.

Wait, perhaps at 30 psia, v_g is actually around 26.8, but that can't be, because higher pressure should lower v_g. Wait, no. At higher pressure, v_g decreases. So at 30 psia, v_g should be lower than 26.8 (which is at 14.7 psia). So I think the correct v_g is about 24.78 ft³/lbm, which I used earlier. So my calculation seems correct.

But the options don't have any close to 52 ft³. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Oh wait, maybe the question is asking for the change in specific volume, not total volume. Or perhaps the problem expects a different approach.

Wait, the problem says "volume change of the mixture." So it's the total volume change, which would be V_final - V_initial, which is 52.00 ft³. So none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the steam table values.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial state is not all liquid but saturated liquid. Oh wait, the problem says "saturated liquid," so initial x=0, and final x=0.7.

Wait, perhaps the pressure isn't constant? Wait, the problem states that the pressure is constant at 30 psia. So that should be correct.

Wait, looking at the options, option J gives a volume change of 28.8 ft³. How would that happen?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in v_g. Let me think again: maybe at 30 psia, v_g is 26.8 ft³/lbm? No, that's at 14.7 psia. At higher pressures, v_g is lower. So, at 30 psia, I'm pretty sure v_g is about 24.78.

Wait, but if I thought v_g was 26.8, then the calculation would be:

v = 0.01772 + 0.7*(26.8 -0.01772) = 0.01772 + 0.7*(26.78228) = 0.01772 + 18.7476 ≈ 18.7653 ft³/lbm.

V_final = 3 * 18.7653 ≈ 56.296 ft³.

Change is 56.296 - 0.0532 ≈ 56.24 ft³. Still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the specific volume units are in cubic feet per pound mass. So maybe I should double-check the values again.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses different units for pressure. Wait, the question says 30 psia, which is pounds per square inch absolute.

Another approach: perhaps the initial specific volume is v_f at 30 psia, and the final is v = v_f + x v_fg.

Let me try looking up the exact values from steam tables.

At 30 psia (P = 30 psia), the saturation temperature T_sat is approximately 250.34°F.

From the saturation table:

v_f = 0.017734 ft³/lbm,

v_g = 24.783 ft³/lbm,

So v_fg = v_g - v_f = 24.783 - 0.017734 = 24.765266 ft³/lbm.

At x=0.7, v = 0.017734 + 0.7 *24.765266 = 0.017734 + 17.335686 ≈ 17.35342 ft³/lbm.

So V_final = 3 lbm * 17.35342 ft³/lbm = 52.06 ft³.

V_initial = 3 * 0.017734 ≈ 0.0532 ft³.

Change in Volume = 52.06 - 0.0532 = 52.007 ft³.

But looking at the options:

Option J says volume change is 28.8 ft³.

Wait, that's way off. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait another thought: perhaps the problem is asking for the change in volume when pressure is not constant? But no, the problem states that pressure is constant.

Wait, perhaps the initial state is not all liquid. No, the problem says it's saturated liquid, so x=0.

Wait, perhaps the quality is 70%, but maybe I'm using the wrong formula for specific volume. Oh wait, specific volume v = v_f + x (v_g - v_f). That should be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the change in volume as (v_final - v_initial) for the same mass, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, another angle: perhaps I should use the specific volume of the final state, which is v = v_f + x v_fg, and then find the volume, but maybe the initial volume is not v_f * m.

Wait, no, initial volume is v_f * m, since it's all liquid.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me look at the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option J: a) 250.34°F, b)30 psia and 250.34°F, c)28.8 ft³.

So for part c, the volume change is 28.8 ft³.

Wait, 28.8 is exactly 3 lbm * 9.6 ft³/lbm. So perhaps the specific volume change is 9.6 ft³/lbm. So where would that come from?

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing something here. Let's think.

Wait, maybe the volume change is only the vapor part?

Wait, no, because the initial volume is all liquid, and the final is a mix. So the change is (v_f +x v_fg) - v_f = x v_fg.

So the change in specific volume is x v_fg. For x=0.7 and v_fg=24.765, that's 0.7*24.765=17.3355 ft³/lbm.

Total volume change would be m*(x v_fg) =3*17.3355≈52.00 ft³. Which again doesn't match any option.

But option J's part c is 28.8 ft³, which is 3*9.6.

Wait, 9.6 is approximately 17.35342 (the final specific volume) minus 0.017734 (initial specific volume). 17.35342 - 0.017734 ≈17.3357 ft³/lbm. Then 3*17.3357≈52.00 ft³. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in using the wrong v_f or v_g. Let me think, perhaps the correct v_f at 30 psia is 0.017734, but maybe v_g is different.

Wait, perhaps I should look up exact steam table values. Since I don't have them in front of me, I have to go by memory.

At 30 psia:

T_sat ≈ 250.34°F,

v_f ≈ 0.017734 ft³/lbm,

v_g ≈ 24.783 ft³/lbm.

So, using these values, the change in volume is 52.007 ft³. But none of the options have that. So perhaps the problem is considering something else.

Wait, another approach: maybe the problem is asking for the volume at the final state, not the change. Let me see the options.

Option J's part c is 28.8 ft³, which would be 3 lbm * 9.6 ft³/lbm. So 9.6 is close to 0.0177 + 0.7*(24.783-0.0177) = 17.3534 ft³/lbm. No, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong units. Wait, 3 pounds is mass. So specific volume is in ft³ per pound mass. So 3 lbm * specific volume gives cubic feet.

Wait, maybe the initial volume is 3 * v_f = 0.0532 ft³, and the final volume is 3 * v = 52.06 ft³. So the change is 52.06 - 0.0532 = 52.0068 ft³. But no option matches that.

Wait, looking at option J again, part c is 28.8 ft³. That's exactly 3 * 9.6. So where does 9.6 come from?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of v. Let me re-calculate.

v = v_f +x(v_g - v_f)= 0.017734 + 0.7*(24.783 -0.017734) = 0.017734 + 0.7*24.765266.

24.765266 *0.7 = let's calculate step by step.

24 *0.7 =16.8

0.765266*0.7≈0.535686.

So total ≈16.8 +0.535686=17.335686.

So v ≈0.017734 +17.335686≈17.35342 ft³/lbm.

So 3 lbm *17.35342 =52.06026 ft³.

So volume change is 52.06026 - (3 *0.017734)=52.06026 -0.053202≈52.007 ft³.

But again, this doesn't match any option.

Wait, perhaps the question intended that the final state is at 70% quality, but the pressure is not constant. Wait, the problem says it's heated at constant pressure. So pressure remains at 30 psia.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about mass, but I think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the options are wrong, or I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the option where a) is 250.34°F, b) is same pressure and temperature, and c) is around 52 ft³. But none of the options have that.

Looking at the options, option J has a) 250.34°F, b) 30 psia and same temp, and c) 28.8 ft³. So the volume change in option J is 28.8, which is way less than what I calculated.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the v_fg value. Wait, perhaps at 30 psia, v_fg is much less. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps v_f is 0.017734, v_g is 24.783, so v_fg is 24.765. That seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the question isn't about the total volume change but something else. Maybe it's the specific volume change, but the question says volume change of the mixture, implying total volume.
