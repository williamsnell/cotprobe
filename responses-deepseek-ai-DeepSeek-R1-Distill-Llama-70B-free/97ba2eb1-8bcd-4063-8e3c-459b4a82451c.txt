Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"In one view the slaveholders have a decided advantage over all opposition. It is well to notice this advantageâ€”the advantage of complete organization. They are organized; and yet were not at the pains of creating their organizations. The State governments, where the system of slavery exists, are complete slavery organizations. The church organizations in those States are equally at the service of slavery; while the Federal Government, with its army and navy, from the chief magistracy in Washington, to the Supreme Court, and thence to the chief marshalship at New York, is pledged to support, defend, and propagate the crying curse of human bondage. The pen, the purse, and the sword, are united against the simple truth, preached by humble men in obscure places."
Frederick Douglass, 1857

Alright, so I've got this question about Frederick Douglass and which social movement he was most influenced by. Let's see what I can figure out here.

Okay, first, I remember that Frederick Douglass was a former slave who became a prominent abolitionist. He wrote a lot about the evils of slavery and fought for its end. So the options given are A through J, each representing a different movement.

Looking at the passage provided, he talks about slaveholders having the advantage of complete organization, mentioning state governments, church organizations, and the federal government all supporting slavery. He also mentions the pen, purse, and sword being against the truth preached by humble men. This makes me think he's opposing a well-entrenched system, so he's probably part of a movement that's against slavery.

Now, the options are:

A: Second Great Awakening
B: The Enlightenment
C: The Temperance Movement
D: The Abolitionist Movement
E: Manifest Destiny
F: The Civil Rights Movement
G: First Great Awakening
H: The Women's Suffrage Movement
I: Popular Sovereignty
J: The Industrial Revolution

I know the Second Great Awakening was a religious revival that happened in the early 19th century. It led to increased religious enthusiasm and also influenced various reforms, including abolition. But Douglass was specifically an abolitionist, so maybe the movement itself is the answer.

The Enlightenment was more about reason and individual rights, influencing the American and French Revolutions, but that was earlier, in the 18th century. Douglass was active in the 19th, so maybe the Enlightenment influenced him, but he's more directly part of the Abolitionist Movement.

The Temperance Movement was about limiting alcohol use. I don't think that's directly related to Douglass's main focus.

Manifest Destiny was about westward expansion and U.S. territorial growth, which doesn't seem to connect with Douglass's abolitionist work.

The Civil Rights Movement came much later, in the 1950s and 60s, so that's after Douglass's time. He was more about ending slavery, which was before the Civil War.

The Women's Suffrage Movement was about women's right to vote. While there might have been some overlap with abolitionists, Douglass did support women's rights, but his primary cause was abolition.

Popular Sovereignty was about letting the people in each territory decide on slavery, which was more of a political stance during the mid-1800s, but I think it's more associated with people like Stephen Douglas and the Kansas-Nebraska Act, not Frederick Douglass.

The Industrial Revolution was an economic shift, so not directly related to his social movement.

So putting it all together, Frederick Douglass was an abolitionist. The passage he wrote criticizes the powerful institutions supporting slavery, which aligns with the Abolitionist Movement's goals. Therefore, the answer should be D: The Abolitionist Movement.

The passage by Frederick Douglass criticizes the organized support for slavery across state, church, and federal institutions, highlighting his opposition to the system. Given his prominent role as an abolitionist, the movement that most influenced him is clearly the Abolitionist Movement. 

Answer: D
