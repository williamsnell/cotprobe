Okay, so I've got this DNA question here. Hmm, let me think. The question is asking which base adenine normally pairs with in DNA. I remember that DNA structure is based on base pairing, right? So the basic rule is that adenine pairs with thymine and guanine pairs with cytosine. Oh wait, but waitâ€”when I think about RNA, adenine pairs with uracil instead. But this question is about DNA, so RNA shouldn't be the case here.

Wait, what are the options again? Let me check. The options are A through J. So looking at the options: option C is thymine and option D is guanine. I've got to choose between those. Oh yeah, in DNA, it's A-T and G-C. So adenine pairs with thymine. So the correct answer should be option C.

But wait, I should make sure I'm not mixing up DNA and RNA. In DNA, the bases are adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine. RNA uses uracil instead of thymine. So in DNA, adenine's partner is thymine. So the answer is C, thymine.

I think that's right. Let me double-check. The pairing is complementary. Adenine has two hydrogen bonds, right? Thymine has two as well, so they pair. Guanine has three, so it pairs with cytosine which has two. Yeah, so it's definitely C.

In DNA, adenine pairs with thymine through complementary base pairing. This is a fundamental aspect of DNA structure, where adenine (A) forms hydrogen bonds with thymine (T), and guanine (G) pairs with cytosine (C). Since the question specifically pertains to DNA, the correct answer is thymine.

Answer: C
