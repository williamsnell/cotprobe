Question:

On Thanksgiving Day, a father was carving a turkey for his family when he seriously cut his hand. The knife severed an artery, causing the father to lose a lot of blood. The mother telephoned their family doctor, who instructed her to drive the father to the local hospital. The doctor indicated that he would meet them there. A short time later at the hospital, the doctor treated the father and bandaged his hand. However, due to the fact that the father had lost a considerable amount of blood, the doctor ordered an immediate blood transfusion. After determining that the father's blood type was A-positive, the doctor orally instructed a nurse, who was employed by the hospital, to obtain the necessary blood for the transfusion. The nurse followed the doctor's instructions and telephoned the hospital's blood bank department and ordered a unit of A-positive blood. The person in the blood bank who received the nurse's call correctly wrote down the order for A-positive blood. However, someone working at the blood bank, whose identity cannot be determined, made an error in filling the order and labeling the unit of blood for the father. As a result, the blood bank sent a unit of B-positive blood mislabeled as A-positive blood. After being administered the wrong blood, the father died. The hospital has a written rule in effect whereby all orders for blood transfusions must be made in writing by the physician in charge of the patient's treatment. Although the doctor was aware of the hospital rule, he, like many other doctors at the hospital, frequently ordered blood transfusions by oral instructions. If the mother asserts a wrongful death action against the doctor, she will most likely

Options:

A: prevail, because the doctor would be responsible for the blood bank's error in administering the wrong blood.
B: not prevail, because the unidentified person in the blood bank who was responsible for sending the wrong blood type was not an employee of the doctor.
C: not prevail, because the hospital, not the doctor, is responsible for the errors of its employees.
D: prevail, because the doctor had a duty of care to ensure the correct blood type was administered.
E: prevail, because the doctor's failure to follow the hospital's rules indirectly led to the father's death.
F: not prevail, because the doctor did not personally administer the wrong blood type.
G: not prevail, because the doctor acted in the same fashion as many other doctors at the hospital.
H: not prevail, because the doctor gave correct instructions to the nurse.
I: prevail, because the doctor did not follow the hospital's rule regarding blood transfusion orders.
J: prevail, because the doctor should have ensured that the nurse followed the hospital's rule for blood transfusion orders.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about a wrongful death case involving a doctor and a hospital. Let me break it down step by step.

So the situation is that a father cut his hand badly on Thanksgiving, and his doctor told them to go to the hospital. The doctor met them there, treated him, and then ordered a blood transfusion because he lost a lot of blood. The doctor told the nurse to get A-positive blood, which the nurse did by calling the blood bank. But someone at the blood bank messed up and sent B-positive instead, which was mislabeled. The father got the wrong blood and died.

The question is about whether the mother can successfully sue the doctor for wrongful death. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I think about the legal concepts involved here. It seems like a case of medical malpractice or negligence. So the key issue is whether the doctor breached the standard of care, causing the patient's death.

The hospital has a rule that all blood transfusion orders must be in writing by the doctor in charge. But the doctor didn't follow that rule; he gave oral instructions instead. Even though many other doctors do the same, the rule exists, and the doctor knew about it.

So the doctor's action was to order blood orally, which violates the hospital's policy. The nurse followed the oral order, but the blood bank made a mistake. Now, the question is whether the doctor is liable for that mistake.

I remember that in medical malpractice, the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur might apply, but more importantly, the concept of vicarious liability. However, vicarious liability usually applies when an employer is liable for an employee's actions. Here, the blood bank employees are hospital employees, not the doctor's. So the doctor isn't their employer.

But wait, the doctor didn't follow the hospital's rule. Why does that matter? If the rule is in place to prevent exactly this kind of error, then not following it could be a breach of duty. The standard of care requires that a doctor follow established protocols to ensure patient safety.

In this case, the doctor's failure to provide a written order might have contributed to the error. If the order had been written, maybe the blood bank would have double-checked it, or the mistake might not have happened. So the doctor's negligence in not following the rule could be the proximate cause of the death.

Looking at the options:

Option I says the mother would prevail because the doctor didn't follow the hospital's rule. That seems to fit, because the rule was meant to prevent such errors, and the doctor's failure to comply could be seen as negligent.

Option D suggests the doctor had a duty to ensure the correct blood type was administered. That's true, but does that duty extend to how the blood bank processes the order? Maybe, but the direct breach was not following the written order rule.

Option E says the doctor's failure indirectly led to death. That's similar to I, but E uses "indirectly," whereas I is more about not following the rule.

Option A says the doctor is responsible for the blood bank's error. But the blood bank is a separate entity, so I don't think the doctor is directly responsible for their mistake unless his negligence caused it.

Option H says the doctor gave correct instructions, so he's not liable. But the issue is that he didn't follow the proper procedure, which could have prevented the error.

So I think the key here is that the doctor violated the hospital's rule, which was designed to prevent such mix-ups. By not putting the order in writing, he increased the risk of error. Therefore, his failure to follow the rule is a breach of the standard of care, leading to the patient's death. So the mother would prevail because of this breach.

Looking back, option I states that the mother would prevail because the doctor didn't follow the hospital's rule. That makes sense. Option J suggests the doctor should have ensured the nurse followed the rule, but the rule was the doctor's responsibility, not the nurse's. So I think the correct answer is I.

The question revolves around whether the doctor can be held liable for the father's death due to a blood transfusion error. The key issue is the doctor's failure to follow the hospital's rule requiring written orders for blood transfusions, which was designed to prevent such mistakes. By giving oral instructions instead, the doctor breached the standard of care, as the written order could have helped prevent the blood bank error. This breach likely contributed to the incorrect blood being administered, leading to the father's death. 

Among the options, the most accurate is that the mother would prevail because the doctor did not follow the hospital's rule, which was in place to prevent such errors. 

Answer: I
