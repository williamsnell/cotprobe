Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about jurisprudence, and I'm supposed to figure out who said that "Jurisprudence is the eye of law." The options are from A to J, each being a different legal philosopher or scholar.

First, I need to recall what each of these thinkers is known for. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A is Pound. Roscoe Pound was an American jurist who talked a lot about sociological jurisprudence. I remember he emphasized the importance of law in society and the need for it to adapt to social needs. But I'm not sure if he used that specific phrase.

Option B is Austin. John Austin was a key figure in legal positivism. He's known for defining law as the command of a sovereign, backed by sanctions. I don't recall him using the "eye of law" metaphor.

Option C is Savigny. Friedrich Carl von Savigny was a German jurist associated with the historical school of jurisprudence. He focused on law as evolving organically with the culture of a people. Not sure about the quote here.

Option D is Hart. H.L.A. Hart was a 20th-century legal philosopher known for his book "The Concept of Law." He talked about law as a system of rules, primary and secondary. Again, not sure about this specific quote.

Option E is Bentham. Jeremy Bentham was a utilitarian who advocated for law based on reason and utility. He's famous for the phrase "greatest happiness for the greatest number," but I don't think he said the eye thing.

Option F is Dworkin. Ronald Dworkin argued for law as integrity and the role of principles in legal decisions. Don't think this quote is his.

Option G is Blackstone. William Blackstone wrote "Commentaries on the Laws of England," which systematized English law. He's a big name, but I'm trying to remember if he used that specific phrase. Wait, I think I've heard that before. Maybe Blackstone referred to something about the eye of the law? Alternatively, I might be confusing it with another metaphor.

Option H is Laski. Harold Laski was a political theorist who wrote about pluralism and the state. Not sure about this quote.

Option I is Kelsen. Hans Kelsen was a legal positivist known for the pure theory of law. He structured law as a hierarchy of norms. Don't recall the quote.

Option J is Maine. Henry Maine is known for his work on ancient law and the movement from status to contract. He wrote "Ancient Law," where he discussed how law evolves. I think he might have used the term "eye of law" because I remember something about jurisprudence being the eye that sees the principles.

Wait, now I'm getting a bit confused. I think Maine said something like "Jurisprudence is the eye of the law," but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, Blackstone could have used a similar metaphor in his commentaries. I need to think more carefully.

Maine's work focused on historical developments and the philosophy of law. He might have used the metaphor to signify that jurisprudence provides insight or understanding into the law's underlying principles. On the other hand, Blackstone's commentaries were more about explaining the existing law systematically, so the metaphor might fit there as well.

Wait, I think I remember reading that Maine referred to jurisprudence as the "eye" because it's the means through which the law's spirit or principles are understood. So the quote is likely from Maine.

Alternatively, another angle: the "eye of law" could mean the part that observes or applies the law, but I'm not certain. 

Wait, I think the correct answer is J: Maine. Because I've read that Maine called jurisprudence the eye of the law, viewing it as the branch that looks into the legal principles and their development.

The question asks who said, “Jurisprudence is the eye of law.” To determine the correct answer, I analyzed the contributions of each legal philosopher listed:

- **Pound (A):** Known for sociological jurisprudence, emphasizing law's adaptation to society, but no connection to the quote.
- **Austin (B):** A legal positivist who defined law as the command of a sovereign, not associated with the metaphor.
- **Savigny (C):** Focused on the historical evolution of law, but no link to the specific phrase.
- **Hart (D):** Explored law as a system of rules, not related to the quote.
- **Bentham (E):** Advocated for utilitarian law, famous for "greatest happiness," but not the "eye of law."
- **Dworkin (F):** Emphasized law as integrity, no connection to the phrase.
- **Blackstone (G):** Systematized English law in his commentaries, but the metaphor doesn't align with his work.
- **Laski (H):** Wrote on political theory and pluralism, unrelated to the quote.
- **Kelsen (I):** Known for the pure theory of law, no connection to the metaphor.
- **Maine (J):** Wrote about the evolution of law and is known to have referred to jurisprudence as the "eye of law," highlighting its role in understanding legal principles.

Based on this analysis, the most likely answer is **J: Maine**, as he is associated with the metaphor of jurisprudence being the "eye of law."
