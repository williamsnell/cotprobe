Okay, so I've got this question about real interest rates and how they change when both the nominal interest rate and inflation change. Let's try to break this down step by step. 

First, I remember that the real interest rate is calculated using the nominal interest rate and the inflation rate. The formula I think is something like Real Rate = Nominal Rate - Inflation Rate. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure if it's exactly that or if there's some more to it, like maybe it's a more precise calculation, but for this purpose, I think the approximation is okay.

So the problem says that the interest rate has risen from 8% to 10% over three years. That's an increase of 2 percentage points. Inflation, on the other hand, has risen from 3% to 5%, which is also an increase of 2 percentage points. 

Let me think about the initial and final real interest rates. Initially, the nominal rate was 8% and inflation was 3%, so the real rate would be 8% - 3% = 5%. Then, after the changes, the nominal rate is 10% and inflation is 5%, so the real rate becomes 10% - 5% = 5%. 

Wait, that's interesting. Both the nominal and inflation rates increased by the same amount, so the real rate remains unchanged. So the real interest rate didn't change—it stayed at 5%. 

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. 

Option A says the real interest rate decreases by 2%. That doesn't fit because the real rate went from 5% to 5%, so no decrease. 

Option B suggests it more than doubles. Well, 5% to 5% is no change, so that's out. 

Option C says the real rate decreases. Again, no change, so C isn't correct. 

Option D claims the real rate increases. But since it stayed the same, D isn't right either. 

Option E says it's halved, but 5% to 5% isn't halving. 

Option F talks about inflation being constant, which it's not—it increased. 

Option G mentions inflation overtaking the interest rate. Wait, the initial inflation was 3% and interest 8%, so inflation was lower. After, inflation is 5% and interest is 10%, so inflation is still lower. So inflation didn't overtake the interest rate. 

Option H says the real rate remains constant. That's exactly what happened—5% to 5%, so H looks correct. 

Option I says the nominal rate is constant, which it's not—it went from 8% to 10%. 

Option J says the real rate increases by 2%. Again, no, it stayed the same. 

So the correct answer should be H: Real interest rate remains constant. 

Wait, but wait a second. Am I remembering the formula correctly? I think another version of the real interest rate formula is (1 + nominal) / (1 + inflation) - 1, which is more precise, especially for larger numbers. But since the numbers here are small (in single digits), the difference between this and the simple subtraction would be minimal. Let me check with the exact formula.

Using the initial rates:
Nominal = 8% or 0.08, Inflation = 3% or 0.03.
Exact real rate = (1.08)/(1.03) - 1 ≈ (1.08/1.03) is about 1.04878, so subtract 1 gives approximately 0.04878 or 4.878%, which we can round to about 4.88%.

After the change:
Nominal = 10% (0.10), Inflation =5% (0.05).
Exact real rate = (1.10)/(1.05) -1 = (1.10/1.05) ≈ 1.047619, subtract 1 gives about 0.047619 or 4.7619%.

So the real rate went from approximately 4.88% to 4.76%, which is a slight decrease, but very minimal. Wait, but using the approximation (Nominal - Inflation), the real rate was 5% both times. So which is it?

Hmm, so the precise calculation shows a slight decrease, but the approximate method shows no change. So the real rate actually slightly decreased, but the options don't have that. Let me look again.

Wait, the options are:

A: decreases by 2% (no, that's a big drop)

C: decreases (this might be correct if the real rate went down a little)

H: remains constant (if we use the approximate method)

So which approach is the question expecting? The question says "what has happened to the real interest rate." If we take the approximate method, then H is correct. But technically, the exact method shows a slight decrease, but none of the options mention a slight decrease except maybe C: real rate decreases.

But wait, the question is multiple-choice, and the options are:

H says it remains constant. But according to exact calculation, it actually decreased a little. So maybe the correct answer is C: real interest rate decreases.

Wait, but the approximate way suggests no change, but the exact way shows a slight decrease. So which option aligns with that?

Looking back at the options:

Option C: Real interest rate decreases. That fits with the exact calculation. So perhaps the intended answer is H, but in reality, the correct answer is C.

Wait, but it's possible that the question expects the use of the approximation formula. Let me think—most basic questions use the nominal minus inflation formula. So perhaps the intended answer is H, as the real interest rate remains the same. 

But I'm a bit confused now. Let me recalculate the exact real rates more accurately.

First period: (1.08)/(1.03) = 1.04878 → 4.878%.

Second period: (1.10)/(1.05) = 1.047619 → 4.7619%.

So the real rate has decreased from approximately 4.88% to 4.76%, which is a decrease of about 0.12 percentage points. So the real rate has decreased, but only slightly. 

But the options are about what happened—did it decrease, increase, stay same, etc. So option C says the real interest rate decreases, which is correct in reality, but option H says it remains constant. 

So the question is: which one is the correct answer based on the options given? The approximate method gives H as correct, while the exact method gives C as correct. 

But in many introductory economics contexts, the real interest rate is approximated as nominal minus inflation. So the change in nominal is 2% (from 8 to 10), and inflation also increases by 2% (3 to 5). So the real rate remains the same. Therefore, the answer would be H.

Alternatively, if the question expects the precise calculation, then the real rate decreases, so C would be correct.

Wait, but the question is about what has happened. So the real interest rate did decrease, albeit slightly. So the correct answer would be C.

But the options are:

C: Real interest rate decreases

H: Real interest rate remains constant.

So which is it? I'm a bit torn.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the exact calculation. Let me check again.

First case:

Nominal = 8%, Inflation =3%.

Real rate: (1 + 0.08)/(1 + 0.03) -1 = 1.08 / 1.03 = approx 1.04878 → 4.878%.

Second case:

Nominal=10%, Inflation=5%.

(1.10)/(1.05) = approx 1.047619 → 4.7619%.

So yes, the real rate has decreased.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: Real interest rate decreases.

But wait, the options don't specify by how much, just whether it increases, decreases, etc. So the correct answer would be C.

Wait, but the initial approximate method suggested no change, but the precise method shows a slight decrease. So perhaps the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, the question might have intended for the real rate to remain the same, leading to H. Hmm.

I think the correct approach is to use the exact formula, so the real rate decreased. Therefore, the answer is C.

Wait, but in the options, C is "Real interest rate decreases." So that's the correct choice.
</think>

To determine what has happened to the real interest rate, we start by recalling the formula for the real interest rate:

\[
\text{Real Interest Rate} = \frac{1 + \text{Nominal Interest Rate}}{1 + \text{Inflation Rate}} - 1
\]

### Initial Period:
- Nominal Interest Rate = 8% (or 0.08)
- Inflation Rate = 3% (or 0.03)

\[
\text{Real Interest Rate} = \frac{1.08}{1.03} - 1 \approx 1.04878 - 1 = 0.04878 \, \text{or} \, 4.878\%
\]

### After the Change:
- Nominal Interest Rate = 10% (or 0.10)
- Inflation Rate = 5% (or 0.05)

\[
\text{Real Interest Rate} = \frac{1.10}{1.05} - 1 \approx 1.04762 - 1 = 0.04762 \, \text{or} \, 4.762\%
\]

### Analysis:
- The real interest rate decreased slightly from 4.878% to 4.762%, indicating a small decline.
- While the nominal interest rate and inflation rate both increased by 2 percentage points, inflation grew slightly faster in relative terms, leading to the decrease in the real interest rate.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A**: "Real interest rate decreases by 2%" — Incorrect, as the decrease is much smaller than 2%.
- **B**: "Real interest rate more than doubles" — Incorrect, as the real interest rate did not increase.
- **C**: "Real interest rate decreases" — Correct, as the real interest rate decreased slightly.
- **D**: "Real interest rate increases" — Incorrect, as the real interest rate did not increase.
- **E**: "Real interest rate is halved" — Incorrect, as the real interest rate did not decrease by half.
- **F**: "Inflation rate is constant" — Incorrect, as inflation increased.
- **G**: "Inflation rate overtakes the interest rate" — Incorrect, as inflation did not surpass the nominal interest rate.
- **H**: "Real interest rate remains constant" — Incorrect, as the real interest rate decreased slightly.
- **I**: "The nominal interest rate is constant" — Incorrect, as the nominal interest rate increased.
- **J**: "Real interest rate increases by 2%" — Incorrect, as the real interest rate did not increase.

### Conclusion:
The real interest rate decreased slightly, making **C: Real interest rate decreases** the correct answer.
