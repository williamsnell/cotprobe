Question:

Farmer Fred was the owner of Grapeview Farm, the largest farm in the County of Grapeview. Fred was advised by his gift and estate attorney to begin making annual fractionalized gifts of the property to his children. Fred executed a conveyance instrument, stating the gifts as "one-thirtieth of my ownership interest in Grapeview County, the eastern one tenth of the western corner of the property is hereby given to all my children per capita." This description of the land to be conveyed is

Options:

A: Sufficient, because it gives a clear description of the fractional gift.
B: Sufficient, because it mentions the name of the county and the property.
C: Sufficient, because it includes the name of the property and a portion of it.
D: Insufficient, because it doesn't state the exact measurements of the land to be given.
E: Insufficient, because the gifts to the children lacked consideration.
F: Insufficient, because it doesn't specify the exact location of the eastern one-tenth.
G: Insufficient, because it is too vague.
H: Sufficient, because the property can be identified.
I: Sufficient, because it satisfies the title of seisin.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about property law, specifically regarding the sufficiency of a land description in a conveyance instrument. Let me break this down step by step.

The question is about Farmer Fred who owns Grapeview Farm. He’s making annual fractionalized gifts to his children. The conveyance instrument he executed describes the gift as "one-thirtieth of my ownership interest in Grapeview County, the eastern one tenth of the western corner of the property is hereby given to all my children per capita."

The question is whether this description is sufficient or not, and why.

First, I remember that for a conveyance of real property to be valid, the description of the land must be sufficient to allow a person to identify and locate the property. The description needs to be specific enough so that someone can pinpoint the exact area being transferred without confusion.

Looking at the description given: It mentions "one-thirtieth of my ownership interest in Grapeview County," which seems to indicate the fraction of ownership being transferred. Then it says "the eastern one tenth of the western corner of the property." Hmm, that might be a bit confusing. Let's parse that.

So, the property is in Grapeview County, and the specific part being conveyed is the eastern one-tenth of the western corner. Wait, that sounds a bit contradictory. The western corner would be the western part of the property, right? So taking the eastern one-tenth of that western corner... Maybe it's like dividing the western corner into ten parts and taking the eastern part of that section. But is that description clear enough?

I think the key issue here is whether the description is sufficiently definite. If the description is too vague, it could lead to disputes about which part of the property is being conveyed. So, does "eastern one tenth of the western corner" provide enough detail?

In property law, descriptions can be metes and bounds, by reference to a map, or sometimes by other descriptive methods. Here, it's a descriptive method, but it's a bit confusing. The phrase "eastern one tenth of the western corner" might not clearly define the area because it's combining two directions and a fraction without exact measurements or clear boundaries.

Another point is that the conveyance is of a fractional interest (one-thirtieth). But the issue isn't about the fraction but the description of the land itself. The problem arises when trying to determine exactly which part of the property is being given. If the description is unclear, it's insufficient.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's sufficient because it gives a clear fractional gift. But the question is about the land description, not the fraction itself.

Option B says it's sufficient because it mentions the county and property name. Well, those are helpful, but not enough if the specific part isn't clear.

Option C: Sufficient because it includes the property name and a portion. Again, the portion's description might be too vague.

Option D: Insufficient because no exact measurements. That's a possibility because without measurements, it's hard to identify the exact area.

Option E: Insufficient due to lack of consideration. No, consideration isn't required for gifts, so E is incorrect.

Option F: Insufficient because it doesn't specify the exact location. That seems possible because the description is vague.

Option G: Insufficient because too vague. This is also a strong contender because the description is confusing.

Option H: Sufficient because the property can be identified. But wait, the property as a whole can be identified, but the specific part being conveyed might not be clear.

Option I: Sufficient because it satisfies title of seisin. I'm not too sure about this term, but I think seisin refers to possession, and the description might not be the main issue here.

Wait, I think the main issue is the description of the specific part. So, if the description is too vague, the conveyance might fail because it's not possible to determine exactly what's being transferred. So, options D, F, G all point towards insufficiency due to lack of clarity.

Between D, F, and G. D says no exact measurements; F says doesn't specify exact location. G says it's too vague.

The description uses relative terms: eastern part of the western corner. It's a bit confusing and might not provide a clear enough picture. So, perhaps it's too vague, making option G correct.

Alternatively, without exact measurements, it's insufficient, so D could be correct.

Wait, but the description does mention a fraction of a part, like the eastern one tenth. So maybe the problem isn't exact measurements but clarity in the description.

Wait, another approach: in real property, the description must be specific enough that a surveyor could locate the property based on the description. If it's the eastern one-tenth of the western corner, that might be ambiguous because "corner" can vary in size and shape. So without more precise measurements or boundaries, it's unclear. So that would make the description insufficient.

So, looking at the options, which one aligns with that reasoning.

Option G says it's insufficient because it's too vague. That fits because the description lacks the necessary specificity.

Alternatively, option F says it doesn't specify the exact location. But I think the main problem is the vagueness, not just the exact location.

So, I'm leaning towards G being the correct answer.

The question revolves around whether the description of the land in Farmer Fred's conveyance instrument is sufficient. The description provided is: "one-thirtieth of my ownership interest in Grapeview County, the eastern one tenth of the western corner of the property is hereby given to all my children per capita." The key issue is whether this description allows for the precise identification and location of the conveyed property.

For a conveyance to be valid, the description of the land must be sufficiently specific to enable someone to identify and locate the property without ambiguity. The description in question mentions the county and the property name, which helps in general identification, but the specific part being conveyed—"the eastern one tenth of the western corner"—is problematic. This phrase is vague and potentially confusing, as it combines relative terms without providing exact measurements or clear boundaries. A surveyor or legal professional would likely struggle to pinpoint the exact area being transferred based on this description.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. While the fractional gift is clear, the land description itself is not.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Mentioning the county and property name is helpful but insufficient if the specific part conveyed is unclear.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The description of the portion is too vague to be sufficient.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. While exact measurements are ideal, the primary issue here is the vagueness of the description, not just the absence of measurements.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. Lack of consideration is irrelevant for gifts.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The issue is not just the lack of exact location but the overall vagueness of the description.
- **Option G**: Correct. The description is insufficient because it is too vague and ambiguous, failing to provide the necessary clarity for identification.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The property as a whole can be identified, but the specific part being conveyed cannot.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The description does not satisfy the requirements for a valid conveyance.

The description lacks the specificity required for a valid conveyance, making it insufficient due to its vagueness.
