Question:

Expectancy theory predicts that worker motivation depends on several factors including “valence,” which refers to:

Options:

A: the worker's beliefs about the potential negative outcomes of unsuccessful performance.
B: the employee’s beliefs about the inherent (intrinsic) value of the work itself.
C: the worker's expectations about the probability of success.
D: the employee’s beliefs about the value of rewards provided for successful performance.
E: the worker's perceived ability to perform the task successfully.
F: the duration of the worker's tenure at the organization.
G: the strength of the worker's motivation and organizational commitment.
H: the worker's beliefs about the fairness of the reward system.
I: the strength of the effort (versus ability) component of the worker’s motivation.
J: the worker's level of satisfaction with the organizational culture.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Expectancy Theory and what "valence" refers to. I'm a bit rusty on my motivation theories, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that Expectancy Theory is one of the theories that explains how motivation works. It's about how people make decisions based on their expectations of outcomes. I think it was developed by Victor Vroom. The theory has three main components: expectancy, instrumentality, and valence.

Let me break them down. Expectancy refers to the belief that a particular level of effort will lead to a particular level of performance. So, it's about how confident someone is that they can achieve a goal if they put in the effort. If someone thinks, "If I study hard, I'll get good grades," that's their expectancy.

Then there's instrumentality, which is the belief that successful performance will lead to a desired outcome. So, if I get good grades (performance), I'll get a scholarship (outcome), that's instrumentality.

The third component is valence, which I think relates to the value or attractiveness of the outcome itself. Valence is about how much someone wants or values the potential reward. For example, if getting a scholarship is very important to me, the valence would be high.

Looking at the question, it asks what valence refers to. So the options are A to J. Let's go through them.

Option A: Worker's beliefs about potential negative outcomes of unsuccessful performance. Hmm, that sounds more like a fear of failure or something related to negative reinforcement. Not valence, I think.

Option B: Beliefs about the inherent value of the work. That seems more like intrinsic motivation, where the work itself is rewarding because it's meaningful or satisfying. Not sure if that's valence.

Option C: Expectations about the probability of success. Oh wait, that's more like expectancy. So C is about how likely the outcome is, which is the first component.

Option D: Beliefs about the value of rewards for successful performance. This sounds like valence because it's about how much the person values the rewards they might receive. So if the rewards are something they really want, valence is high.

Option E: Perceived ability to perform the task. That's more about self-efficacy, which might tie into expectancy, but not valence.

Option F: Duration of tenure. Doesn't seem related to valence.

Option G: Strength of motivation and commitment. That's more of an outcome rather than a component of the theory itself.

Option H: Beliefs about fairness of the reward system. That might relate to equity theory, not directly valence.

Option I: Strength of effort component. Maybe about how much effort someone is willing to put in, but not valence.

Option J: Satisfaction with organizational culture. That's more about job satisfaction overall, not valence.

So putting it together, valence is about the value of the rewards. So the correct answer should be D.

The question asks about the concept of "valence" in Expectancy Theory, which refers to the perceived value or attractiveness of potential outcomes or rewards. Valence is one of the three key components of the theory, along with expectancy and instrumentality. It specifically concerns how much an individual desires or values the rewards they might receive for successful performance.

Analyzing the options:

- **A** refers to fear of negative outcomes, which is unrelated to valence.
- **B** pertains to intrinsic motivation, not valence.
- **C** describes expectancy, not valence.
- **D** directly aligns with valence, as it focuses on the value of rewards.
- **E** relates to self-efficacy, not valence.
- **F, G, H, I, J** are unrelated to valence.

Thus, the correct answer is **D**, as valence is about the perceived value of rewards.

Answer: D
