Question:

A state has a statute prohibiting the sale of guns and ammunition to any person under the age of 17. Violation of the statute is a felony punishable by a fine of $5,000 and imprisonment for up to two years. The state courts have interpreted this statute as a public welfare offense requiring no particular mental state for its violation. As such, this is a strict liability crime whereby culpability is imposed on a defendant for doing the proscribed act. A defendant, a 15-year-old, entered the store to purchase a shotgun as a present for her father. She took a shotgun off the shelf and went to the cashier's counter to pay for it. Not seeing the cashier anywhere, the defendant left the exact price for the shotgun on the countertop and left the store. If the defendant is prosecuted for violating the state statute, she should be found

Options:

A: not guilty, provided that the legislative intent was not to make the purchase of shotguns a criminal offense.
B: not guilty, if she believed the gun was a toy and not a real weapon.
C: not guilty, because she did not have any criminal intent when purchasing the shotgun.
D: guilty, because she did not wait for the cashier to handle the transaction properly.
E: not guilty, provided that she returns the shotgun immediately upon learning of the statute.
F: not guilty, provided she was unaware that the statute prohibited the sale of weapons to a person in her age group.
G: guilty, because she purchased the shotgun while under the statutory age.
H: guilty, because she left the money for the shotgun and took the gun without any supervision.
I: guilty, because her age alone qualifies her for the strict liability of the statute.

Alright, so I've got this law question in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

Okay, the scenario is about a state statute that prohibits selling guns and ammunition to anyone under 17. The penalty is a felony with a $5,000 fine and up to two years in prison. The state courts have interpreted this as a public welfare offense, meaning it's a strict liability crime. So, no particular mental state is required—just the act itself makes someone guilty.

The defendant is a 15-year-old girl who went into a store to buy a shotgun as a present for her father. She took the shotgun off the shelf and went to the cashier. But when she didn't see the cashier, she left the exact price on the counter and left the store.

Now, the question is, if she's prosecuted under this statute, what's the outcome? The options are A to I.

First, I need to understand strict liability crimes. From what I remember, strict liability means that the prosecution only needs to prove that the defendant committed the prohibited act (actus reus) and doesn't need to prove any criminal intent (mens rea). So, even if the defendant didn't intend to break the law, they can still be found guilty.

In this case, the statute prohibits selling guns to people under 17. But wait, the defendant is the buyer, not the seller. Hmm, the question says the statute prohibits the sale to any person under 17. So, does this mean that the seller is the one committing the crime by selling to a minor, or does it apply to the buyer as well?

Wait, the statute says it's a crime to sell to a person under 17. So, the crime is on the part of the seller, not the buyer. But the way the question is phrased, the defendant is the buyer. Oh, wait, no, wait. Let me read again. The statute prohibits the sale to any person under 17. So, the seller is the one who would be guilty if they sell to someone under 17. But the question is about prosecuting the defendant, who is the 15-year-old buyer. So, can the buyer be guilty under this statute?

Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check the statute again. It says, "prohibiting the sale of guns and ammunition to any person under the age of 17." So, the act of selling is prohibited if the buyer is under 17. So, the seller would be the one violating the law by making the sale. But in this scenario, the defendant is the buyer. So, is the buyer committing a crime by attempting to purchase, or is the crime solely on the seller?

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. The way the question is worded, the defendant is the one being prosecuted, but under a statute that prohibits the sale to minors. So, perhaps the statute also makes it a crime for a minor to attempt to purchase, or perhaps not.

Wait, maybe the statute is only targeting the sellers, not the buyers. So, if that's the case, the defendant, as the buyer, wouldn't be guilty under this statute because it doesn't prohibit her from buying, it prohibits others from selling to her. But maybe I'm wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the statute also imposes liability on the buyer. The wording isn't explicit. It just says, "prohibiting the sale... to any person under 17." So, it's about the sale, not the purchase. Therefore, the seller is the one who violates the law when they sell to a minor.

But the question is about the buyer being prosecuted. So, if the statute only applies to the seller, then the buyer wouldn't be guilty. But then, what about if the statute is interpreted to also apply to the buyer's actions?

Wait, the question says the state courts have interpreted this as a strict liability offense, so perhaps the focus is on whether the defendant's actions fall under the prohibited conduct. The prohibited conduct is the sale, so the seller is the one who sells. The buyer's action is attempting to purchase, but the statute doesn't directly prohibit purchasing by minors, only selling to them.

But wait, maybe the way the defendant acted—taking the shotgun and leaving money—could be seen as an attempt to purchase, which might be covered under the statute. Or perhaps the statute also criminalizes the act of purchasing as a minor.

Wait, but the statute's wording is "prohibiting the sale of guns and ammunition to any person under 17." So, it's the sale that's prohibited, meaning the seller is the one who can't sell, not that the buyer can't buy. Therefore, the defendant, as the buyer, isn't violating the statute because the statute isn't directed at her actions as a buyer.

Wait, but that's a bit confusing because sometimes statutes can have provisions that apply to both the seller and the buyer. For example, some laws make it illegal to sell alcohol to minors and also illegal for minors to purchase alcohol. So, maybe this statute is similar, but the question doesn't specify that. It only mentions prohibiting the sale to minors, not prohibiting minors from purchasing.

Therefore, if the statute only prohibits the sale, then the seller would be guilty, not the buyer. But the question is asking about the buyer's guilt. So, if the statute doesn't prohibit the buyer's actions, then the defendant wouldn't be guilty under this statute.

Wait, but the options include things like G and I, where G says guilty because she purchased under age, and I says guilty because her age makes her guilty under strict liability.

So, perhaps the statute is being interpreted to also apply to the buyer's actions. Let me think again. The statute says it's a public welfare offense, strict liability. So, maybe the actus reus is selling or purchasing? Or maybe just selling.

Wait, the problem says the statute prohibits the sale to a person under 17, so the prohibited act is selling, not buying. Therefore, the defendant, as the buyer, didn't commit the prohibited act. So, she can't be guilty under this statute.

But wait, perhaps the way she acted—taking the shotgun and leaving money—could be considered an attempt to purchase, which might fall under a different statute, but not under this one. So, unless the statute also prohibits purchasing, she's not guilty.

Wait, but maybe in this state's interpretation, the statute includes both selling and purchasing. Or perhaps the courts have interpreted it to also apply to the buyer. Since the question says that the state courts have interpreted this as a public welfare offense requiring no particular mental state, so it's strict liability.

But the actus reus is still the sale. So, the defendant didn't sell; she tried to buy. So, she didn't commit the prohibited act.

Wait, but the problem says she took the shotgun and went to the cashier, but the cashier wasn't there, so she left the money. So, she didn't actually complete the purchase. So, she didn't receive the shotgun from the seller. Therefore, the seller didn't sell it to her. So, perhaps no sale occurred, so the statute wasn't violated by anyone.

But the question is about prosecuting the defendant for violating the statute. So, if the statute is about selling, and she didn't sell, then she's not guilty.

Wait, but perhaps the statute also makes it a crime for a minor to attempt to purchase. But the statute as described doesn't say that. It only prohibits the sale to minors.

So, if the statute only prohibits selling, then the buyer isn't guilty. So, the defendant, as the buyer, isn't guilty under this statute.

But looking at the options, I need to find which option aligns with this reasoning.

Option A says not guilty if legislative intent wasn't to criminalize purchase. But the statute's intent isn't clear, but the question says the statute prohibits the sale, so legislative intent is to prevent selling to minors.

Option B: not guilty if she thought it was a toy. But this is strict liability, so her belief doesn't matter.

Option C: not guilty because no criminal intent. But strict liability doesn't require intent, so this is irrelevant.

Option D: guilty because she didn't wait for the cashier. But that's about the process, not the statute's prohibition.

Option E: not guilty if she returns it. Doesn't matter, because strict liability is about the act, not subsequent actions.

Option F: not guilty if she was unaware of the statute. Again, strict liability doesn't care about knowledge.

Option G: guilty because she purchased under age. But if the statute doesn't prohibit purchasing, she didn't violate it.

Option H: guilty because she left money and took the gun without supervision. But again, the statute is about selling, not buying.

Option I: guilty because her age makes her guilty under strict liability. But only if the statute applies to her actions.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the statute also applies to the buyer, making it illegal for a minor to purchase. The wording is ambiguous. Let me read the statute again: "prohibiting the sale of guns and ammunition to any person under the age of 17." So, it's the sale that's prohibited, but perhaps the purchase is also prohibited as part of the transaction.

Alternatively, maybe the courts have interpreted the statute to include both the seller and the buyer. For example, in some cases, both parties can be guilty of the same crime, like in a drug sale where both buyer and seller can be charged.

So, if the statute is interpreted to include the buyer's actions, then the defendant, as a buyer under 17, would be guilty. But the question says the statute prohibits the sale, not the purchase. So, unless the statute explicitly includes purchasing, the defendant isn't guilty.

But the question states that the state courts have interpreted the statute as a public welfare offense. So, perhaps they've broadened it to include attempts to purchase as well, making the buyer guilty.

Wait, but the question is about whether the defendant should be found guilty. So, if the statute only prohibits selling, then the buyer isn't guilty. But if the statute also prohibits purchasing, then she is guilty.

But the statute's wording is "prohibiting the sale... to any person under 17," which suggests it's directed at the seller, not the buyer. So, the defendant, as the buyer, didn't commit the prohibited act.

Wait, but maybe the defendant attempted to purchase, which could be seen as a form of solicitation or attempt, but the statute doesn't mention that. So, she didn't complete the purchase because the cashier wasn't there, so she didn't actually receive the shotgun. So, no sale occurred, so the statute wasn't violated by anyone.

But the question is about prosecuting the defendant, so perhaps the issue is whether her actions constitute an attempt to violate the statute. But since the statute is about selling, and she's the buyer, her attempt to buy wouldn't be an attempt to sell, so she's not guilty.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the elements of the crime. The statute requires that a sale occurs to a person under 17. The defendant is the person under 17, but she's the buyer. So, the seller would be guilty if they sold to her, but she, as the buyer, isn't guilty under this statute unless the statute also prohibits purchasing, which it doesn't as per the wording.

Therefore, the defendant didn't commit the prohibited act, so she can't be guilty.

Looking at the options, the correct answer would be that she's not guilty because the statute doesn't apply to her actions as a buyer. But looking at the options, which one says that?

Option A says not guilty if legislative intent wasn't to make purchase a crime. But the question's statute is about sale, so legislative intent is to criminalize sale, not purchase.

Option I says guilty because her age qualifies her under strict liability. But if the statute doesn't apply to her actions, then her age alone doesn't make her guilty.

Wait, but perhaps the statute is intended to prevent minors from having guns, so maybe the courts would interpret it to apply to both sellers and buyers. But the question's wording doesn't specify that. It only says the statute prohibits the sale to minors, so it's about the seller's actions.

Therefore, the defendant, as the buyer, didn't violate the statute, so she's not guilty.

Looking at the options, the ones that say not guilty are A, B, C, E, F. The ones that say guilty are D, G, H, I.

Now, considering strict liability, the defendant's intent doesn't matter. So options B and C, which mention belief or intent, are incorrect because strict liability doesn't require intent.

Option A says not guilty if legislative intent wasn't to criminalize purchase. Since the statute is about sale, not purchase, perhaps A is correct.

Wait, but the question is about whether she's guilty under the statute as it's written. The legislative intent is to prohibit sales to minors, so the statute doesn't criminalize purchasing. So, she can't be guilty because she didn't commit the prohibited act.

Therefore, the correct answer would be that she's not guilty because the statute doesn't apply to her actions. Looking at the options, option A says not guilty if legislative intent wasn't to make purchase a crime. Since the statute's intent is to prevent sales, not purchases, A would apply.

But wait, option A is conditional: "provided that the legislative intent was not to make the purchase of shotguns a criminal offense." So, if the legislative intent wasn't to criminalize purchase, then she's not guilty.

But the question states that the statute prohibits the sale, so the intent is clear. So, she's not guilty because the statute doesn't apply to her as a buyer.

Wait, but the options don't have an option that directly states that the statute doesn't apply to buyers. So, perhaps the correct answer is A.

Alternatively, maybe none of the options directly state that, but looking at the options again:

Option I says guilty because her age qualifies her under strict liability. But strict liability applies only if she's committing the prohibited act. If the prohibited act is selling, then her age doesn't make her guilty unless she's the seller.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach this differently.

Strict liability means that if the statute requires only the act, and the defendant performed that act, then she's guilty regardless of intent.

The prohibited act is selling to someone under 17. So, the seller is the one who commits the act. The buyer's act is purchasing, which isn't prohibited by the statute.

Therefore, the defendant didn't commit the prohibited act, so she's not guilty.

So, the answer should be not guilty, and the correct option would be one that reflects that the statute doesn't apply to her actions.

Looking again, option A says not guilty if legislative intent wasn't to make purchase a crime. Since the statute is about sale, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that she's guilty because she attempted to purchase, but the statute doesn't mention attempt. So, without the statute criminalizing attempt, she can't be guilty of attempt.

Wait, but the question says she went through the motions of purchasing, but didn't complete it because the cashier wasn't there. So, did she attempt to purchase? If the statute doesn't criminalize attempt, then she's not guilty.

So, in that case, she's not guilty because she didn't complete the purchase, and the statute doesn't apply to her as a buyer.

Alternatively, if the statute includes attempting to purchase, but the question doesn't say that.

I'm starting to think that the correct answer is that she's not guilty because the statute only applies to sellers, not buyers. Therefore, the options that say not guilty would be correct, but I have to pick which one.

Wait, the options don't have an option that says "not guilty because the statute only applies to sellers." So, perhaps the intended answer is that she's guilty because she's under 17 and the statute is strict liability, so her age makes her guilty regardless of intent.

But that would be the case only if the statute applies to buyers. Since the statute prohibits sales, not purchases, she's not guilty.

Wait, but the question says she's being prosecuted under the statute. So, if the statute doesn't apply to her actions, she can't be guilty.

Therefore, the correct answer should be not guilty, and the option that aligns with that reasoning is A: not guilty, provided legislative intent wasn't to criminalize purchase.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is I: guilty because her age qualifies her under strict liability. But that would require that the statute applies to her as a buyer, which it doesn't.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of it another way. Strict liability crimes often involve regulatory offenses where the focus is on the act, not intent. For example, selling alcohol to minors is a strict liability offense for the seller. The buyer isn't guilty under that statute unless there's a separate law.

So, in this case, the defendant is the buyer. The statute doesn't make it a crime for her to purchase; it's a crime for the seller to sell. Therefore, she's not guilty.

So, the answer should be not guilty, which would correspond to option A, B, C, E, or F.

But looking back, the options:

A: not guilty, provided legislative intent wasn't to make purchase a crime.

B: not guilty, if she thought it was a toy.

C: not guilty, no criminal intent.

E: not guilty, if she returns it.

F: not guilty, if unaware of statute.

Strict liability doesn't require intent or knowledge, so options B, C, F are incorrect because they focus on her state of mind, which isn't relevant.

Option A: depends on legislative intent. Since the statute is about sale, not purchase, legislative intent wasn't to criminalize purchase, so she's not guilty. So, A would be correct.

But wait, the question states that the state courts have interpreted the statute as a public welfare offense requiring no particular mental state. So, perhaps the courts have also interpreted it to apply to both sellers and buyers, making the buyer guilty as well. But the question doesn't say that.

Alternatively, perhaps the statute's wording is broad enough to include both parties. But the wording is "sale to," which implies the seller's action.

So, I think the correct answer is that she's not guilty because the statute only applies to sellers, not buyers. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.

The question revolves around a state statute that prohibits the sale of guns and ammunition to persons under the age of 17. This statute is interpreted as a strict liability offense, meaning that intent or knowledge is not required for a conviction. The defendant, a 15-year-old, attempted to purchase a shotgun but did not complete the transaction because the cashier was absent. The issue is whether the defendant can be found guilty under this statute.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Statutory Language**: The statute prohibits the "sale" of guns and ammunition to minors. This language suggests that the prohibited act is the seller's action of selling, not the buyer's action of purchasing. Therefore, the statute appears to target sellers, not buyers.

2. **Strict Liability**: Under strict liability, the prosecution only needs to prove that the defendant
