Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about instrumental responses and punishment. Hmm, I remember from my psychology class that instrumental conditioning has to do with behaviors being learned through their consequences. So, like, if a behavior is rewarded, it's more likely to happen again, and if it's punished, it's less likely.

The question is asking about what happens when an instrumental response of moderate strength is subjected to moderate punishment. The options are A through J, each suggesting a different outcome.

Wait, instrumental responses are actions that lead to specific outcomes, right? So punishment in this context would be something unpleasant that follows the behavior, which should decrease its occurrence. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

I think Thorndike's law of effect is related here. It states that behaviors followed by a satisfying consequence will be strengthened, and those followed by an unsatisfying one will be weakened. So punishment is an unsatisfying consequence, leading to the behavior decreasing.

But the question is about the response being of moderate strength and the punishment being moderate. So what happens then? I remember something about the effectiveness of punishment. If the punishment is too mild, maybe the behavior doesn't decrease as much. Or maybe it temporarily stops but then comes back.

Wait, there's also the concept of extinction. Extinction happens when a behavior is no longer reinforced, leading to its decrease. But that's more about stopping reinforcement, not punishment. Punishment is actively applying an aversive stimulus.

Oh, right! When you apply punishment, the behavior might be suppressed. But if the punishment isn't strong enough, maybe the suppression isn't permanent. So the response might be temporarily suppressed but then recover over time, especially if the punishment isn't consistent or strong enough.

Looking at the options, option A says "be temporarily suppressed but strengthen over time." That sounds like what I was thinking. Because if the punishment is moderate, it might not completely eliminate the behavior. Instead, the behavior decreases at first but then comes back, maybe because the organism habituates to the punishment or finds ways to avoid it.

Other options: B says eliminated, which seems too strong if the punishment is only moderate. C says strengthened, which doesn't make sense because punishment should weaken, not strengthen. D says remains unchanged, which also doesn't fit. E is increase in frequency, which is the opposite of what punishment does. F, erratic, I'm not sure about that. G is suppressed, but it doesn't mention the temporary aspect. H, more precise, that doesn't seem right. I, uncontrolled, no. J, replaced by stronger response, not sure.

So I think A is the correct answer because moderate punishment would cause a temporary suppression, and then the response might strengthen again over time, possibly due to the organism getting used to the punishment or finding it's not that bad.

When an instrumental response of moderate strength is subjected to moderate punishment, the behavior is likely to be temporarily suppressed. However, because the punishment is not strong enough to eliminate the behavior entirely, the response may strengthen over time as the organism habituates to the punishment or finds ways to cope with it. This aligns with the concept that moderate punishment may not have a lasting suppressive effect.

The correct answer is:

A: be temporarily suppressed but strengthen over time

Answer: A
