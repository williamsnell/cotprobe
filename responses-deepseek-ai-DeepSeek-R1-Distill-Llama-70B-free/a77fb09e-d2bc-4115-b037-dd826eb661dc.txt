Okay, so I've got this tax question in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading it carefully.

So, Strom is acquiring a 25% interest in the Ace Partnership. He's contributing land. The land has an adjusted basis of $16,000, but its fair market value is $50,000. There's a mortgage of $24,000 on the land, and Ace is assuming that mortgage. No other liabilities existed at the time of the contribution. The question is asking for Strom's basis in Ace.

Hmm, I remember that when a partner contributes property to a partnership, the partner's basis in the partnership is determined by the adjusted basis of the property contributed, minus any liabilities assumed by the partnership. But wait, I think I need to consider a few things here.

First, the general rule is that a partner's basis in the partnership is equal to the adjusted basis of the property contributed minus any liabilities the partnership assumes that are allocable to that property. So, in this case, Strom is contributing land with a basis of $16,000, and the partnership is taking on a $24,000 mortgage.

Wait, but the adjusted basis is $16k, and the FMV is $50k. But I think for basis purposes, the contribution is treated as the partner contributing the asset. So, the basis would be the adjusted basis of the property minus any liabilities the partnership assumes.

So, the formula should be: Basis = Adjusted Basis of Property - Liabilities Assumed.

In this case, that would be $16,000 (adjusted basis) minus $24,000 (mortgage assumed). Wait, that would give me a negative number. That can't be right because basis can't be negative. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the rules. I think when a partner contributes property with a mortgage, the partnership's assumption of the mortgage affects the partner's basis. The partner's basis is the adjusted basis of the property minus the amount of the liability assumed by the partnership. But if the liability exceeds the adjusted basis, the partner's basis can't go negative. Or perhaps there's something else I'm missing.

Wait, another thought: if the land is subject to a mortgage, and the partnership assumes it, the partner's basis would be the adjusted basis of the property minus the mortgage. But wait, that's leading to a negative number here. So, 16,000 - 24,000 = -8,000. That doesn't make sense. Basis can't be negative.

Alternatively, maybe the basis is the fair market value minus the liability? No, I don't think so. Because the basis is based on the contributor's adjusted basis, not the FMV.

Wait, maybe the initial approach is incorrect. Let me think again.

I remember that when a partner contributes property to a partnership, the contribution is treated as a transfer of the asset to the partnership. The partner's basis in the partnership is the adjusted basis of the property contributed, but with some adjustments. Specifically, if the partnership assumes a liability on the contributed property, that reduces the partner's basis.

So, the formula is: Partner's basis = Adjusted basis of property - Liabilities assumed by the partnership.

So here, it's $16,000 (adjusted basis) minus $24,000 (liability) equals negative $8,000. That can't be right, as basis can't be negative. So perhaps in such a case, the basis is zero, and the excess is treated as gain.

Wait, but that's not directly asked here. The question is only about Strom's basis in the partnership, not about gain recognition.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in calculating it. Let me check the rules again.

Under the Internal Revenue Code, specifically Section 722, when a partner contributes property to a partnership, the partner's basis in the partnership is the adjusted basis of the property contributed, minus any liabilities that the partnership assumes and that are allocable to that property.

So, in this case, the adjusted basis is $16,000, and the liability assumed is $24,000. So, 16,000 - 24,000 = -8,000. But basis can't be negative. So, perhaps the basis is zero, and the excess ($8,000) is treated as a gain.

Wait, but the question is asking for Strom's basis, not whether there's a gain. So, if the calculation results in a negative number, does that mean the basis is zero?

Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the situation. Let me think about it differently. The partnership is assuming the mortgage, so Strom is relieved of that debt. The amount of the mortgage that's in excess of the adjusted basis would be treated as gain. But the basis in the partnership would be the adjusted basis minus the liability, but if that's negative, perhaps the basis is zero, and the excess is treated as gain to Strom.

Wait, but the question is about Strom's basis, so perhaps the calculation is as follows: 

Basis = Adjusted basis of the property - Liabilities assumed.

If that's negative, then the basis is zero. So in this case, 16,000 - 24,000 = -8,000 → basis is zero.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure. I think I might have heard that when the liability exceeds the basis, the basis is zero, and the difference is treated as gain. So, in this case, Strom's basis would be zero. But looking at the options, option G is zero. But let me think again.

Another approach: the basis of the partnership interest is the adjusted basis of the contributed property minus any liabilities assumed. So, 16,000 - 24,000 = -8,000. But since basis can't be negative, it would be zero. So, the answer would be G: $0.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something else. Because sometimes, when you contribute property, the basis is the lower of the adjusted basis or the fair market value if the contribution is subject to certain conditions. Or perhaps not. Wait, no, that's when the partnership is the one that would have to adjust the basis of the asset under Section 723, but for the partner's basis in the partnership, it's based on their own adjusted basis.

Alternatively, perhaps the basis is the fair market value of the property minus the liability. Because the land's FMV is $50,000, and the mortgage is $24,000. So 50,000 - 24,000 = 26,000. But that would be option F: $26,000. But wait, no, because the partner's basis is determined by their own adjusted basis, not the FMV.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to recall the exact rule. The partner's basis in the partnership is equal to the adjusted basis of the property contributed, minus any liabilities of the partnership that are assumed and allocable to that property. So, in this case, it's 16,000 -24,000 = -8,000. But basis can't be negative, so perhaps the basis is zero.

But wait, I've read somewhere that if the amount of liabilities assumed exceeds the adjusted basis, the basis is zero, and the excess is treated as gain. So, that would mean Strom's basis is zero, and there's a gain of $8,000, which would be recognized under certain circumstances.

Wait, but the question is only about the basis, not about gain. So, the basis would be zero.

But looking at the options, option G is zero. So, the answer would be G.

Wait, but another thought: maybe the basis is not negative, perhaps it's the fair market value minus liability. Let's see, 50,000 -24,000 = 26,000. That would be option F. But why would that be the case?

Because sometimes, when you contribute property, the basis to the partnership is the FMV, but for the partner's basis, it's based on their own adjusted basis. Unless the contribution is treated as a sale, but that's when the FMV is higher and the partner's interest is 80% or less.

Wait, in this case, Strom is contributing a 25% interest. So, the partnership is treated as a new entity, and the contribution is not considered a sale because Strom's interest is less than 80%? Wait, no, I think the 80% is for when the transferor is not in a partnership. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the rules for when a transferor retains an interest.

Wait, Section 721 says that the transfer of property to a partnership in exchange for an interest in the partnership is tax-free, except to the extent the liabilities assumed exceed the adjusted basis. So, in that case, the partner's basis is adjusted basis minus liabilities assumed, but any excess is treated as gain.

So, in this case, adjusted basis is $16,000, liabilities assumed are $24,000. So, 16,000 - 24,000 = -8,000. That's a negative number, so basis is zero, and the excess ($8,000) is treated as gain.

So, the basis would be zero, option G.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I've seen examples where the basis is calculated without considering the liability. Let me think about another example: If I contribute land worth $10,000 basis, with a $5,000 mortgage, and the partnership assumes it. My basis would be 10,000 -5,000 = $5,000.

In this case, the liability is larger than the basis, so 16k -24k = -8k → basis is zero.

So, the correct answer would be G: $0.
</think>

When Strom contributes land to the Ace Partnership, the basis in the partnership is determined by the adjusted basis of the contributed property minus any liabilities assumed by the partnership. Here, the adjusted basis of the land is $16,000, and the partnership assumes a $24,000 mortgage. 

Using the formula:

\[
\text{Basis} = \text{Adjusted Basis of Property} - \text{Liabilities Assumed}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Basis} = \$16,000 - \$24,000 = -\$8,000
\]

However, a partner's basis in the partnership cannot be negative. When the liabilities assumed exceed the adjusted basis, the basis is treated as $0, and the excess ($8,000 in this case) is treated as gain to the partner. Since the question specifically asks for Strom's basis in the partnership, the correct answer is $0.
