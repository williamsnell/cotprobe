Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about vapor pressure and temperatures. Hmm, I remember that when two substances have the same vapor pressure at a certain temperature, that's when their vapor pressure curves intersect. But wait, how do I calculate that?

The question gives me the boiling points and heats of vaporization for water and chloroform. Boiling points are at standard atmospheric pressure, right? So water boils at 100°C, which is 373 K, and chloroform at 60°C, which is 333 K. The heats of vaporization are 12.0 kcal/mol for water and 7.0 kcal/mol for chloroform.

I think I need to use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation here. The equation is ln(P2/P1) = (ΔHvap/R) (1/T1 - 1/T2), but wait, when would their vapor pressures be the same? Oh, right, because at their respective boiling points, their vapor pressures are both 1 atm. But I'm looking for the temperature where their vapor pressures are equal, which might not be at either of their boiling points.

Wait, no, the problem is to find the temperature where their vapor pressures are the same. So maybe I can set their vapor pressures equal using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation for each and solve for T.

Alternatively, there's another approach where you can compare their vapor pressures at a common temperature. Let me think. The Antoine equation is another way, but I don't have the constants here. Hmm, maybe using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation in a different form.

Wait, another approach: at some temperature T, the vapor pressure of water (P_water) equals the vapor pressure of chloroform (P_chloroform). At their boiling points, their vapor pressures are 760 mmHg (1 atm). But we need to find T where P_water = P_chloroform.

So, using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation for each substance from their boiling points to this common temperature T:

For water:
ln(P_water / P1_water) = (ΔH_water / R) (1/T1_water - 1/T)

Similarly for chloroform:
ln(P_chloroform / P1_chloroform) = (ΔH_chloroform / R) (1/T1_chloroform - 1/T)

But at the temperature T where their vapor pressures are the same, P_water = P_chloroform = P. So, let me set P_water = P_chloroform = P.

So for water:
ln(P / 760) = (12000 cal/mol / R) (1/373 - 1/T)

Wait, wait, the units for R: since the ΔH is in kcal, R is usually 1.987 cal/(mol·K), but sometimes in J, but let me stick with cal here to avoid confusion.

Wait, the problem states the heats of vaporization in kcal/mol, so yes, R is 1.987 cal/(mol·K).

So for water: ΔH is 12,000 cal/mol. For chloroform: 7,000 cal/mol.

So the equations become:

For water:
ln(P/760) = (12000 / 1.987) * (1/373 - 1/T)

For chloroform:
ln(P/760) = (7000 / 1.987) * (1/333 - 1/T)

Wait, wait, no. Because at T, the vapor pressure is P. At their boiling points (T1), the vapor pressure is 760 mmHg. So the equation should be ln(P/P1) = (ΔH/R) (1/T1 - 1/T). So correct.

So for water, P1_water is 760 mmHg at T1_water = 373 K. Similarly, for chloroform, P1_chloroform is 760 mmHg at T1_chloroform = 333 K.

But at temperature T, both have vapor pressure P. So for each:

ln(P/760) = (ΔH_water/R)(1/373 - 1/T)  -- (1)

ln(P/760) = (ΔH_chloroform/R)(1/333 - 1/T) -- (2)

Since both equal ln(P/760), set them equal:

(12000 / 1.987)(1/373 - 1/T) = (7000 / 1.987)(1/333 - 1/T)

The 1.987 cancels out, so:

12000 (1/373 - 1/T) = 7000 (1/333 - 1/T)

Divide both sides by 1000 to make it simpler:

12 (1/373 -1/T) = 7 (1/333 -1/T)

Let me compute each term:

Compute 1/373 ≈ 0.002681 (since 373 is about 380 would be ~0.00263, 373 is a bit less than 380, so reciprocal a bit higher).

1/333 ≈ 0.003003.

So substituting:

12*(0.002681 - (1/T)) = 7*(0.003003 - (1/T))

Let me expand this:

12 * 0.002681 - 12*(1/T) = 7 * 0.003003 -7*(1/T)

Calculate each multiplication:

12*0.002681 = 0.032172

7*0.003003 = 0.021021

So equation becomes:

0.032172 -12*(1/T) = 0.021021 -7*(1/T)

Let me bring like terms together. Subtract 0.021021 from both sides:

0.032172 - 0.021021 -12*(1/T) +7*(1/T) =0

0.011151 -5*(1/T) = 0

So,

5*(1/T) = 0.011151

1/T = 0.011151 /5 ≈ 0.0022302

So T = 1 / 0.0022302 ≈ 448.4 K.

Looking at the options, option F is 448 K, which is very close. So the answer should be F.

To determine the temperature at which water and chloroform have the same vapor pressure, we use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. The equation is:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{P}{P_1}\right) = \frac{\Delta H_{\text{vap}}}{R} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T}\right)
\]

Here:
- \(P_1 = 760 \, \text{mmHg}\) (standard atmospheric pressure),
- \(T_1\) is the boiling point of each substance,
- \(\Delta H_{\text{vap}}\) is the heat of vaporization,
- \(R = 1.987 \, \text{cal/(mol·K)}\).

For water:
- \(T_1 = 373 \, \text{K}\),
- \(\Delta H_{\text{vap}} = 12,000 \, \text{cal/mol}\).

For chloroform:
- \(T_1 = 333 \, \text{K}\),
- \(\Delta H_{\text{vap}} = 7,000 \, \text{cal/mol}\).

At the temperature \(T\) where their vapor pressures are equal, the equations for water and chloroform become:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{P}{760}\right) = \frac{12,000}{1.987} \left(\frac{1}{373} - \frac{1}{T}\right)
\]

\[
\ln\left(\frac{P}{760}\right) = \frac{7,000}{1.987} \left(\frac{1}{333} - \frac{1}{T}\right)
\]

Since the left-hand sides are equal, we set the right-hand sides equal:

\[
\frac{12,000}{1.987} \left(\frac{1}{373} - \frac{1}{T}\right) = \frac{7,000}{1.987} \left(\frac{1}{333} - \frac{1}{T}\right)
\]

The \(1.987\) cancels out, and simplifying:

\[
12,000 \left(\frac{1}{373} - \frac{1}{T}\right) = 7,000 \left(\frac{1}{333} - \frac{1}{T}\right)
\]

Dividing through by 1,000:

\[
12 \left(\frac{1}{373} - \frac{1}{T}\right) = 7 \left(\frac{1}{333} - \frac{1}{T}\right)
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
12 \cdot \frac{1}{373} - 12 \cdot \frac{1}{T} = 7 \cdot \frac{1}{333} - 7 \cdot \frac{1}{T}
\]

\[
0.032172 - \frac{12}{T} = 0.021021 - \frac{7}{T}
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
0.032172 - 0.021021 = \frac{12}{T} - \frac{7}{T}
\]

\[
0.011151 = \frac{5}{T}
\]

Solving for \(T\):

\[
T = \frac{5}{0.011151} \approx 448.4 \, \text{K}
\]

The closest option is \(448 \, \text{K}\), which corresponds to **F**.
