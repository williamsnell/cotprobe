Question:

What is the role of psychological inconsistency in the theory of cognitive dissonance?

Options:

A: Psychological inconsistency in the theory of cognitive dissonance prompts a person to increase the importance of consistent beliefs or actions.
B: Psychological inconsistency in the theory of cognitive dissonance results in a person seeking external validation to justify the dissonant beliefs or actions.
C: Psychological inconsistency in the theory of cognitive dissonance leads to a state of equilibrium where dissonant and consonant elements coexist without any change.
D: Psychological inconsistency is deemed irrelevant in the theory of cognitive dissonance and has no effect on behavior or attitudes.
E: Psychological inconsistency in the theory of cognitive dissonance is an indicator of mental illness.
F: Psychological inconsistency in the theory of cognitive dissonance leads to an increase in the dissonant beliefs or actions.
G: Psychological inconsistency in the theory of cognitive dissonance is typically resolved through the intervention of a professional therapist.
H: Psychological inconsistency in the theory of cognitive dissonance motivates a person to ignore the dissonant elements.
I: Psychological inconsistency in the theory of cognitive dissonance is resolved through the development of new, unrelated attitudes or actions.
J: Psychological inconsistency in the theory of cognitive dissonance motivates a person to change either the attitude or action that is responsible for the dissonance.

Okay, so I have this question about cognitive dissonance and psychological inconsistency. I'm a bit rusty on my psychology, but I remember that cognitive dissonance is a concept by Leon Festinger. Let me try to think through this.

The question is asking about the role of psychological inconsistency in the theory. I think cognitive dissonance happens when there's a conflict between two things a person believes, knows, or does. Like when someone buys an expensive car and then feels bad because they also know it's not the best choice, maybe they start rationalizing it.

So, psychological inconsistency must be the state where these conflicting elements exist. And according to the theory, people feel discomfort when this happens. This discomfort is what we call dissonance. Now, how does the theory say people deal with this? I remember that people are motivated to reduce this dissonance to feel better. They can do this in a few ways: changing their attitude, changing their behavior, or maybe justifying it somehow.

Looking at the options, I need to pick the one that describes what happens because of this inconsistency. Let's go through them:

Option A says that inconsistency makes people increase the importance of consistent beliefs or actions. Hmm, that sounds possible. Maybe they emphasize the beliefs that are in line to reduce the conflict.

Option B suggests seeking external validation. Like telling others to justify their actions. That does happen, but is it the primary role of inconsistency here?

Option C says it leads to equilibrium without change. No, that doesn't make sense because the whole theory is about the drive to change something to reduce the discomfort.

Option D claims inconsistency is irrelevant, which is definitely wrong because the theory hinges on it.

Option E links it to mental illness, which I don't think is the case. Dissonance is a normal part of life, not an illness.

Option F says inconsistency leads to increasing dissonant elements, which seems counterintuitive. Why would someone make the inconsistency worse?

Option G talks about professional therapists. I don't think the theory says that. People usually handle it on their own.

Option H says people ignore the dissonant elements. That could be a way to reduce it, like denying the problem.

Option I says it's resolved by developing new unrelated attitudes. Not sure about that. More likely, they adjust existing ones.

Option J states that inconsistency motivates a person to change either their attitude or action causing the dissonance. That rings a bell because I remember that the theory is about how people adjust their cognition or behavior to reduce discomfort.

So putting it all together, the inconsistency (dissonance) drives people to make changes. So the correct answer should be J. Let me make sure: yes, the theory says that people will experience discomfort and then take action to resolve it, either changing their attitude or their behavior to align and reduce the dissonance.

The theory of cognitive dissonance, developed by Leon Festinger, explains that psychological inconsistency occurs when there is a conflict between a person's beliefs, attitudes, or actions. This inconsistency leads to a state of discomfort, known as dissonance, which motivates individuals to reduce the discomfort. According to the theory, people typically resolve this dissonance by either changing their attitude, altering their behavior, or justifying their actions to restore consistency.

Analyzing the options provided:

- **Option A** suggests increasing the importance of consistent beliefs or actions, which is possible but not the primary focus of the theory.
- **Option B** mentions seeking external validation, which can occur but is not the central mechanism.
- **Option C** implies no change, which contradicts the theory's emphasis on reducing dissonance.
- **Option D** claims inconsistency is irrelevant, which is incorrect as it is central to the theory.
- **Option E** links dissonance to mental illness, which is not accurate.
- **Option F** suggests increasing dissonant elements, which is counterintuitive.
- **Option G** involves professional therapists, which is not part of the theory.
- **Option H** proposes ignoring dissonant elements, which is a possible coping mechanism but not the primary resolution.
- **Option I** mentions developing new, unrelated attitudes, which is less likely than adjusting existing ones.
- **Option J** states that inconsistency motivates change in attitude or action, aligning with the theory's core idea.

Thus, the correct answer is **J**, as it accurately reflects the theory's explanation that psychological inconsistency motivates individuals to change either their attitude or action to reduce dissonance.
