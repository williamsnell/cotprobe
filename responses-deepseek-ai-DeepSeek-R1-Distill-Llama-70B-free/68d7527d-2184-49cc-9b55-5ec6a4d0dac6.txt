Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the energy emitted by Avogadro's number of atoms. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question says each atom emits a light wave with a wavelength of 400 nm. Oh right, Avogadro's number is 6.022e23, right? So I need to find the total energy when all those atoms emit light.

Wait, energy of a photon. Oh yeah, the formula is E = hc/λ. Where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. Let me jot that down.

So h is 6.626e-34 J·s, and c is about 3e8 m/s. But wait, the wavelength here is in nanometers. Oh right, I should convert that to meters. So 400 nm is 400e-9 meters, or 4e-7 m.

Calculating the energy per photon first. Plugging the numbers in: E = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (3e8 m/s) / (4e-7 m). Let's compute that.

Multiply 6.626e-34 by 3e8 first. 6.626 *3 is about 19.878, and the exponents would be 1e-26 (since 1e-34 *1e8 =1e-26). So 19.878e-26 J·m? Wait, no, because the denominator is meters, so that cancels out.

Wait, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m? Or wait, no, let me calculate it properly.

Actually, let me compute it step by step. 6.626e-34 times 3e8 is 6.626*3 = 19.878, and then 1e-34 * 1e8 =1e-26. So 19.878e-26 J·m divided by 4e-7 m. Oh wait, because the λ is in meters. So the m units will cancel.

So the calculation becomes (19.878e-26 J·m) / (4e-7 m) = (19.878 /4 )e-19 J.

19.878 divided by 4 is approximately 4.9695. So each photon has energy about 4.9695e-19 J.

Now, since there are Avogadro's number of atoms, which is 6.022e23, the total energy is the energy per photon multiplied by Avogadro's number.

So total E = 4.9695e-19 J/photon * 6.022e23 photons.

Multiply the numbers: 4.9695 *6.022 is approximately let's see, 4 *6 is 24, 0.9695*6 is about 5.817, so total around 29.817? Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

4.9695 * 6.022 = Let's compute 4 *6 is 24. 4 *0.022 is 0.088. 0.9695 *6 is 5.817. 0.9695 *0.022 is about 0.0213. So adding all together: 24 + 0.088 =24.088, plus 5.817 is 29.905, plus 0.0213 is about 29.926. So approximately 29.926e( -19 +23 ) which is 29.926e4, right?

Wait, no, exponents: 1e-19 * 1e23 is 1e4. So E is 29.926e4 J. Which is 2.9926e5 J. Oh, looking at the options, option G is 4.98e5, H is 3.98e5, F is 2.98e5, J is 6.02e5. So 2.99e5 is close to option F, which is 2.98e5.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the initial energy per photon. Let me recalculate E = hc/λ.

h =6.626e-34 J·s

c=3e8 m/s

λ=400e-9 m =4e-7 m.

So E= (6.626e-34 *3e8) / (4e-7)

Compute numerator:6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 4e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 /4e-7 = (1.9878 /4 ) * 1e-18.

1.9878 /4 is 0.49695. So E per photon is 0.49695e-18 J, which is 4.9695e-19 J. That's correct.

Then, multiply by Avogadro's number: 4.9695e-19 *6.022e23.

4.9695e-19 *6.022e23 = (4.9695 *6.022) *1e(4) [because 1e-19 *1e23 is 1e4].

4.9695 *6.022: Let's compute more accurately.

4 *6 =24, 4 *0.022=0.088, 0.9695 *6=5.817, 0.9695 *0.022=0.0213.

Wait, perhaps a better way: 4.9695 *6.022.

Multiply step by step:

4.9695 *6 = 29.817

4.9695 *0.022 = let's compute 4.9695 *0.02 = 0.09939, and 4.9695 *0.002=0.009939. So total 0.09939 +0.009939=0.109329.

So 29.817 +0.109329 =29.926329.

So 29.926e4 J is 2.9926329e5 J. So approximately 2.993e5 J.

Looking at the options:

Option F is 2.98e5, which is 2.98 x1e5.

Hmm, my calculation is about 2.993e5, which is 2.99e5, but the options don't have that exact number. So perhaps F is 2.98e5, which is close.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I should compute E per mole.

Wait, another approach: calculate the energy per mole.

Because Avogadro's number is per mole.

So E per photon is hc/λ.

Number of photons per mole is Avogadro's number.

So energy per mole E_mol = N_A * hc / λ.

Wait, that's the same as what I did.

Hmm, perhaps I should calculate the exact value without approximating.

Let me compute 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25.

Divide by 4e-7: 1.9878e-25 /4e-7 = (1.9878 /4) *1e-18.

1.9878 /4=0.49695.

So 0.49695e-18 J/photon.

Multiply by 6.022e23 photons/mol.

0.49695e-18 *6.022e23= (0.49695 *6.022) *1e5.

Compute 0.49695 *6.022.

So 0.4 *6=2.4, 0.4 *0.022=0.0088.

0.09695 *6=0.5817, 0.09695 *0.022= 0.002131.

Wait, perhaps precise calculation:

0.49695 *6.022.

Let me compute 0.49695 *6 = 2.9817

0.49695 *0.022 = 0.01092 approximately (0.49695 *0.02 is 0.009939, and 0.49695 *0.002=0.0009939, sum to 0.010933.)

So total is 2.9817 + 0.010933 = 2.992633.

So 2.992633e5 J/mol.

So that's approximately 2.99e5 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is option F:2.98e5, or perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is precise. So 2.9926e5 rounds to approximately 2.99e5. But looking at the options, option F is 2.98e5. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps using more precise numbers. Let me recast the calculation.

E per photon = (6.62607015e-34 J·s) * (299792458 m/s) / (400e-9 m)

Wait, exact values: h is exactly 6.62607015e-34 J·s since 2019 definition. Speed of light is exactly 299792458 m/s.

Wait, using these exact numbers:

E = (6.62607015e-34) * (299792458) / (400e-9)

Compute numerator: 6.62607015e-34 * 299792458.

Let me compute 6.62607015 * 2.99792458e8.

Wait, 6.62607015 * 2.99792458 = let's compute that.

6 *3 is 18, but more accurately:

6.62607 *2.99792 = ?

Let me compute 6 *2.99792 =17.98752.

0.62607 *2.99792 = approx 1.876 (since 0.6 *3=1.8, 0.02607 *3≈0.078, so total approx 1.878).

So total is 17.98752 +1.876= about19.8635.

So 6.62607e-34 *2.99792e8 =19.8635e-26 J·m.

Divide by 400e-9 m.

19.8635e-26 / 400e-9 = (19.8635 /400 )e-17 J.

Wait, 19.8635/400 = 0.04965875.

So E per photon is 0.04965875e-17 J = 4.965875e-19 J.

Now multiply by Avogadro's number (6.02214076e23).

Total E =4.965875e-19 *6.02214076e23 = (4.965875 *6.02214076 )e(4) J.

Compute 4.965875 *6.02214076.

Let me compute 4 *6=24.

0.965875 *6=5.79525.

4 *0.02214076=0.088563.

0.965875 *0.02214076 ≈0.02138.

Wait, perhaps a better way: 4.965875 *6.02214076.

Let me compute 4.965875 *6 =29.79525.

4.965875 *0.02214076 ≈0.10992.

So total is 29.79525 +0.10992 ≈29.90517.

So total E is 29.90517e4 J =2.990517e5 J.

Rounded to three significant figures, that's 2.99e5 J.

Looking back at the options, the closest is option F:2.98e5. But wait, perhaps I should check the options again.

The options are:

A: 5.20 × 10^5 J

B: 2.58 × 10^5 J

C: 2.20 × 10^5 J

D: 3.50 × 10^5 J

E: 1.98 × 10^5 J

F: 2.98 × 10^5 J

G: 4.98 × 10^5 J

H: 3.98 × 10^5 J

I: 1.50 × 10^5 J

J: 6.02 × 10^5 J

Wait, the calculation gives approximately 2.99e5, which is close to option F (2.98e5), but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, maybe I should check the exponent.

Wait, 29.905e4 is 2.9905e5. So that's 2.9905e5 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is F:2.98e5, but that's 2.98, not 2.99. Hmm, perhaps due to rounding at different steps. Or maybe I made a calculation error.

Wait, perhaps I should use the precise calculation.

E per photon = (6.62607015e-34 * 299792458) / (400e-9)

Compute numerator: 6.62607015e-34 *2.99792458e8 = ?

6.62607015 *2.99792458 ≈ 19.8646 (exact product might be a bit more precise, but let's say 19.8646e-26).

So 19.8646e-26 /400e-9 = (19.8646 /400 )e-17 = 0.0496615e-17 =4.96615e-19 J.

Multiply by 6.02214076e23:

4.96615e-19 *6.02214076e23 = (4.96615 *6.02214076 )e4.

Compute 4.96615 *6.02214.

4 *6=24.

4 *0.02214=0.08856.

0.96615 *6=5.7969.

0.96615 *0.02214=approx 0.0214.

So adding up: 24 +0.08856=24.08856 +5.7969=29.88546 +0.0214≈29.90686.

So 29.90686e4 J is 2.990686e5 J, which is approximately 2.99e5 J.

So looking at the options, the closest is F:2.98e5, but perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe I should re-express the calculation another way.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the energy per mole using E = (N_A * h c)/λ.

Let me plug in the numbers:

N_A =6.022e23

h=6.626e-34

c=3e8

λ=400e-9.

So E = (6.022e23) * (6.626e-34 *3e8)/(400e-9)

Compute denominator: 400e-9 =4e-7.

So E =6.022e23 * (6.626e-34 *3e8 )/4e-7.

Compute numerator inside: 6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25.

So E =6.022e23 * 1.9878e-25 /4e-7.

1.9878e-25 /4e-7 =4.9695e-19.

Then E=6.022e23 *4.9695e-19 = ?

6.022e23 *4.9695e-19 =6.022 *4.9695e(23-19+0) )=6.022*4.9695e4.

6.022*4.9695 = approx 6 *5=30, but more accurately:

4.9695 *6=29.817, 0.022 *4.9695≈0.1092. So total 29.817 +0.1092=29.9262.

So 29.9262e4 =2.99262e5 J.

So again, 2.99262e5, which is approximately 2.99e5. But the options don't have that exact number. So perhaps the intended answer is option F, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the units. Did I convert nm to meters correctly?

Yes, 400 nm is 400e-9 m =4e-7 m. That's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about energy per mole, but perhaps I should calculate the energy in kJ or another unit. But the options are in J, so that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps using frequency instead of wavelength. Wait, no, the energy of a photon is E=hc/λ.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about frequency, not wavelength. Wait, no, the question says wavelength, so the correct formula is E=hc/λ.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the energy is for one mole of photons, but the question says Avogadro's number of atoms each emit a photon. So each atom emits one photon.

So the calculation should be correct.

Wait, perhaps the initial energy per photon should be in a different unit. Let me check the calculation once more.

E per photon = 6.626e-34 *3e8 /4e-7.

Wait, 3e8 /4e-7 = 3e8 /4e-7 = (3/4)*1e15 =0.75e15 =7.5e14.

So 6.626e-34 *7.5e14 = ?

6.626 *7.5 =49.695.

Multiply exponents: 1e-34 *1e14 =1e-20.

So E per photon=49.695e-20 =4.9695e-19 J. Same as before.

So same result, so same total energy.

So I think the correct answer should be approximately 2.99e5 J, but the options don't have that exact number. The closest is F:2.98e5.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate 6.022 *4.9695.

6 *4.9695=29.817.

0.022 *4.9695=0.1092 approximately.

So 29.817+0.1092=29.9262.

So 29.9262e4 =2.99262e5.

So perhaps the intended answer is option F, but why is there a discrepancy? Maybe the calculation expects to round to three significant figures. 2.99e5 is 2.99, which is approximately 3.
