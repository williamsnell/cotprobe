Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

On May 2, a woman mailed the following letter to a man:"May 1I have two tickets to the concert on July 1 at the auditorium in town. I'll sell them to you for $60 per ticket, which is $10 above face value. Since the concert has been sold out for months, I think that is a good deal. You have 15 days from the above date to decide whether to accept this offer. "The man received the letter on May 4, but did not read it until May 6. On May 18, the man went to the woman's home and attempted to accept the offer. The woman replied:"Too late! I sold the tickets last week for $75 each. "Assume that the woman's letter created in the man a valid power of acceptance. Was that power terminated by lapse of time before the man went to the woman's home on May 17?

Options:

A: Yes, because the man did not read the letter until after the 15-day period.
B: No, because the woman sold the tickets before the man could accept the offer.
C: Yes, because the letter was mailed on May 2.
D: No, because the man attempted to accept the offer within 15 days of receiving the letter.
E: Yes, because the letter was dated May 1.
F: No, because the man did not read the letter until May 6.
G: No, because the man was still within the 15-day period when he went to the woman's home.
H: No, because the man received the letter on May 4.
I: Yes, because the woman had already sold the tickets by the time the man went to her home.
J: Yes, because the man attempted to accept the offer after 15 days from the date of the letter.

Okay, so I've got this question about contract law, specifically regarding the termination of the power of acceptance. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when an offer is made, the offeree has a certain period during which they can accept it. If they don't accept within that time, the offer lapses. But wait, there are some nuances here.

The situation is that a woman sent a letter to a man on May 2. The letter is dated May 1. In it, she offers to sell him two concert tickets for $60 each, which is $10 above face value. She mentions the concert is sold out and thinks it's a good deal. She gives him 15 days from the date of the letter (May 1) to decide.

The man receives the letter on May 4 but doesn't read it until May 6. Then, on May 18, he goes to her home to accept the offer, but she says it's too late because she sold them for $75 each the previous week.

The question is whether the power of acceptance lapsed before May 17 when he tried to accept.

Wait, I think the key here is the time period for acceptance. The offer says 15 days from May 1. So May 1 plus 15 days would be May 16. So the offer would lapse on May 16. If he tried to accept on May 18, that's two days after the offer expired.

But wait, when does the acceptance period start? Is it from when the offer is made (date on the letter, May 1), or from when it's received? Because the man received it on May 4. Oh, right, in contract law, for mailed offers, the time starts when the offer is received, unless the offer specifies otherwise. But in this case, the offer says "15 days from the above date," which is May 1. So the offer is open until May 16, regardless of when he received it.

So the man received it on May 4 but didn't read it until May 6. But the offer period runs from May 1 to May 16. So he had from May 1 to May 16 to accept. If he tried on May 18, that's after the 15 days.

Wait, but some sources say that the time for acceptance starts when the offer is received, unless stated otherwise. But the offer here specifically says 15 days from May 1, so that's clear. So the time starts from May 1, not from when he received it.

So the man's attempt on May 18 is after the 15-day period, so the offer has lapsed. But wait, the woman sold the tickets on May... she sold them last week when he came on May 18. So she sold them before May 18, perhaps on May 11 or so. But the question is whether the power was terminated by lapse of time before he went on May 17. Wait, he went on May 18, but the question says "on May 17" in the question? Wait, no, the question says he went on May 18, but the options might be mixing that up.

Wait, the question is: Was the power terminated by lapse of time before the man went to the woman's home on May 17? Wait, the scenario says he went on May 18. But the question in the options says May 17? Hmm, perhaps a typo. Wait, let me check the original question again.

No, the question states: On May 18, the man went to accept. But the question says "before the man went on May 17." Wait, that's a mistake. Or maybe I misread. Let me read again.

The question says: "Was that power terminated by lapse of time before the man went to the woman's home on May 17?"

Wait, but in the scenario, he went on May 18. So perhaps the question is incorrect, or maybe I'm misreading. Alternatively, perhaps the attempted acceptance was on May 17, and the woman said she sold them last week, which could be before May 17.

Wait, the scenario says he went on May 18, but the question is about May 17. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe it's a typo in the question. Alternatively, perhaps the woman sold the tickets before May 18, so when he tried on May 18, she had already sold them, but that's revocation, not lapse.

Wait, but the question is about whether the power was terminated by lapse of time before he went on May 17. So if the 15 days ended on May 16, then on May 17, the offer had lapsed. So if he went on May 17, the power was already terminated. But in the scenario, he went on May 18, which is after May 16, so the power had lapsed.

But the question is about whether the power was terminated by lapse of time before he went on May 17. So up to May 17, the 15 days would have ended on May 16. So on May 17, the power is already terminated. Therefore, if he went on May 17, it's too late. But in our case, he went on May 18, which is even later.

Wait, but the options don't all match this. Let's look at the options.

Option A: Yes, because the man did not read the letter until after the 15-day period. But the 15-day period is from May 1, so ends May 16. He read it on May 6, which is during the period. So A is incorrect.

Option B: No, because the woman sold the tickets before he could accept. Selling the tickets is revocation, but if the time had lapsed, the power is gone regardless. So B is about revocation, not lapse, so B is not the correct reason.

Option C: Yes, because the letter was mailed on May 2. But the time starts from May 1, the date in the letter. So C is irrelevant.

Option D: No, because he accepted within 15 days of receiving the letter. Wait, the offer says 15 days from May 1, not from receipt. So D is incorrect because he didn't accept within 15 days of receipt (he received on May 4; 15 days would be May 19), but the offer's time was up on May 16.

Option E: Yes, because the letter was dated May 1. Well, that's the start of the period, so E is correct in stating that the 15 days ran from May 1. So E might be a contender.

Option F: No, because he didn't read until May 6. But the time runs from May 1, not from when he read it. So F is incorrect.

Option G: No, because he was within 15 days when he went on May 17. Wait, May 1 +15 days is May 16. So May 17 is day 16? Wait, May 1 is day 1, so May 16 is the 15th day. So May 17 would be day 16, which is beyond the period. So G is incorrect.

Option H: No, because he received on May 4. The time starts from May 1, not receipt, so H is incorrect.

Option I: Yes, because the woman sold the tickets. That's revocation, not lapse. So I is incorrect.

Option J: Yes, because he accepted after 15 days from the letter's date. The letter is dated May 1, so 15 days is May 16. He went on May 18, which is after, so J is correct.

Wait, but the question is whether the power was terminated before he went on May 17. So May 17 is after May 16, so the power had lapsed by then. So any attempt on or after May 17 is too late.

So the correct answer would be J: Yes, because he accepted after 15 days from the date of the letter.

Wait, but the woman sold the tickets before he went. Does that matter? No, because the question is about lapse of time, not revocation. So the woman's sale could be her revoking the offer, but if the time had already lapsed, the acceptance is ineffective regardless.

So the answer would be J.

The question revolves around whether the power of acceptance lapsed due to the passage of time before the man attempted to accept the offer on May 18. The woman's letter, dated May 1, granted the man 15 days from that date to accept the offer. This means the offer would lapse on May 16. The man received the letter on May 4 but did not read it until May 6. However, the 15-day period runs from May 1, as specified in the letter, and not from the date of receipt or when the man read it. Therefore, the offer lapsed on May 16, regardless of when the man read the letter or attempted to accept it.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The man read the letter on May 6, which is within the 15-day period (May 1 to May 16).  
- **B**: Incorrect. The woman selling the tickets constitutes revocation, not lapse of time.  
- **C**: Incorrect. The mailing date (May 2) is irrelevant since the 15-day period runs from May 1.  
- **D**: Incorrect. The 15-day period is tied to the letter's date (May 1), not the receipt date (May 4).  
- **E**: Incorrect. While the letter is dated May 1, this does not explain why the power of acceptance lapsed.  
- **F**: Incorrect. The man's failure to read the letter until May 6 does not affect the lapse of time.  
- **G**: Incorrect. May 17 is after the 15-day period (May 1 to May 16), so the power of acceptance had already lapsed.  
- **H**: Incorrect. The receipt date (May 4) is irrelevant since the 15-day period runs from May 1.  
- **I**: Incorrect. The woman selling the tickets is revocation, not lapse of time.  
- **J**: Correct. The man attempted to accept the offer on May 18, which is after the 15-day period (May 1 to May 16), so the power of acceptance had lapsed.

Thus, the power of acceptance was terminated by lapse of time before the man attempted to accept the offer.
