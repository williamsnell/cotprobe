Question:

A common rocket propellant is a mixture of one part liquid hydrazine (N_2H_4) as fuel and two parts liquid hydrogen peroxide (H_2O_2) as oxidizer.

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about rocket propellants. Hmm, the question is about finding the heat of reaction when liquid hydrazine reacts with hydrogen peroxide. The reaction is given as N2H4(l) + 2 H2O2(l) → N2(g) + 4 H2O(g). I need to find the heat of reaction at 25°C.

Wait, heat of reaction. Oh right, that's the enthalpy change, ΔH. And since it's given in Kcal per mole, I should probably look up the standard enthalpies of formation for each substance involved.

So, the formula is ΔH° = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants). Right, because the heat of reaction is the sum of the heats of formation of the products minus that of the reactants.

Let me jot down the reaction again: 1 mole of N2H4(l) reacts with 2 moles of H2O2(l) to produce 1 mole of N2(g) and 4 moles of H2O(g).

I need the standard enthalpies of formation for each of these substances. I remember that elements in their standard state have ΔHf° of zero. So N2(g) is an element in its standard form, so ΔHf° is 0. H2O(g) is water vapor; I think its ΔHf° is around 44 kcal/mol, but wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact values. Let me think. Oh wait, no, wait. Actually, I think the standard enthalpy of formation for H2O(l) is about -68.3 kcal/mol. But this is H2O(g), so it's higher. I recall that H2O(g) has a ΔHf° of around 44.01 kcal/mol. Or is it different? Maybe I should double-check in my mind. Oh wait, no, I'm getting this mixed up. Another thought: perhaps the value is positive because forming gas from liquid requires energy. Yeah, that makes sense.

Wait, let's get the exact values. From what I remember, standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) at 25°C:

- N2H4(l): I think it's around +12 kcal/mol. Or wait, was it positive? Because hydrazine is a compound, so its formation is endothermic relative to elements. So yes, positive.

- H2O2(l): I'm pretty sure it's about -26.5 kcal/mol. Because hydrogen peroxide is a stable compound, but its formation is exothermic because O-O bonds are weaker than O=O, or something like that. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the standard enthalpy of formation for H2O2(l) is actually negative? Because it's formed from H2 and O2, and the reaction is exothermic. Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Another thought: H2O2 is less stable than H2O. Oh, right, so the ΔHf° for H2O2(l) is about -26.5 kcal/mol. Because when you form it from H2 and O2, it's exothermic, but not as much as H2O. Wait, I'm getting this a bit mixed up. Let me try to remember: H2O(l) is about -68.3 kcal/mol. H2O2(l) would be higher than that, because it's less stable. So maybe ΔHf° for H2O2(l) is around -26.5 kcal/mol. Then, H2O(g) is about +44.01 kcal/mol, I think.

Wait, let me clarify:

- ΔHf° for N2(g) is 0.
- ΔHf° for H2O(g): I think it's +43.9 kcal/mol. Yes, because H2O(l) is -68.3, and the heat of vaporization is about 10 kcal/mol, so H2O(g) would be around -68.3 + 10.5 = around -57.8? Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the standard enthalpy of formation for H2O(g) is 44.01 kJ/mol, but wait, the question uses kcal. Oh wait, I need to be careful with units.

Wait, I'm confusing kJ and kcal here. Let me make sure. The standard enthalpy of formation for H2O(g) is about 44 kJ per mole, which is about 10.5 kcal/mol (since 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ). Wait, no, wait. 44 kJ is 44 / 4.184 ≈ 10.5 kcal. But I thought I've heard it as around 57 kcal before. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the units. Alternatively, maybe the value is positive 57.8 kcal/mol? Because when you form H2O(g) from H2 and O2, the reaction is exothermic, so ΔHf° should be negative, right? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the formation reaction is H2(g) + ½ O2(g) → H2O(g). The ΔH for this reaction is the standard enthalpy of formation. And since it's exothermic, ΔH is negative. So for H2O(g), ΔHf° is negative 57.8 kcal/mol? Wait, no, that can't be right because I thought H2O(l) is -68.3 kcal. Because when you form H2O(l), it's more exothermic than the gas. So H2O(g) is less negative. So if H2O(l) is -68.3 kcal, then H2O(g) would be higher (less negative), like maybe -57.8 kcal. Oh, wait, no, no. Because when you go from gas to liquid, it's exothermic. So H2O(g) → H2O(l) releases heat, so H2O(g) has higher enthalpy (less stable) than H2O(l). So the ΔHf° for H2O(g) would be higher (less negative) than that of H2O(l). So if H2O(l) is -68.3 kcal, then H2O(g) would be maybe around -57.8 kcal. Because the heat of vaporization of water is about 10.5 kcal/mol (at 25°C, I think the ΔHvap is about 10.5 kcal/mol). So yes, that makes sense: H2O(g) is ΔHf°= -57.8 kcal.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to structure this:

ΔHf° for H2O(l): -68.3 kcal/mol (this I remember)
ΔHvap for H2O at 25°C: about 10.5 kcal/mol (heat required to vaporize)
So when H2O(l) → H2O(g), ΔH = +10.5 kcal/mol.

So the ΔHf° for H2O(g) would be ΔHf°(H2O(l)) + ΔHvap = (-68.3) + 10.5 = -57.8 kcal/mol.

Ah, okay, so H2O(g) has a ΔHf° of -57.8 kcal/mol.

Similarly, for N2H4(l): I think it's positive. I remember that hydrazine has a positive enthalpy of formation. Let's say it's about +12 kcal/mol. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's +12.1 or something like that.

Hydrogen peroxide, H2O2(l): I think its ΔHf° is negative. Because it's formed from H2 and O2. The reaction is  H2(g) + O2(g) → H2O2(l). ΔH is negative because H2O2 is more stable (but not as much as H2O). Wait, but I thought H2O2 is less stable than H2O, but more than O2 and H2? Or is it the other way around? Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of bond energies. Breaking H-H and O=O bonds and forming O-H and O-O bonds. But perhaps I'm getting off track.

I think the ΔHf° for H2O2(l) is about -26.5 kcal/mol. Let me confirm that. Yes, I've heard that number before, so I'll go with that.

So now, let's plug the numbers into the equation.

The reaction is:

N2H4(l) + 2 H2O2(l) → N2(g) + 4 H2O(g)

So the calculation is:

ΔH° = [ (1 mol * ΔHf° N2(g)) + (4 mol * ΔHf° H2O(g)) ] - [ (1 mol * ΔHf° N2H4(l)) + (2 mol * ΔHf° H2O2(l)) ]

Plugging in the numbers:

ΔH° = [ (1 * 0) + (4 * (-57.8)) ] - [ (1 * 12) + (2 * (-26.5)) ]

Wait, let's compute each part step by step.

First, the products:

N2(g): 0.

Each mole of H2O(g) is -57.8, so 4 moles would be 4*(-57.8) = -231.2 kcal.

So products sum: 0 + (-231.2) = -231.2 kcal.

Now, the reactants:

N2H4(l) is 12 kcal/mol. So 1 mole is +12.

H2O2(l) is -26.5 kcal/mol per mole. 2 moles would be 2*(-26.5) = -53.

So reactants sum: 12 + (-53) = -41 kcal.

Wait, wait, no: 12 + (-53) = -41.

So total ΔH° is (-231.2) - (-41) = ?

Wait, subtract the reactants from the products.

ΔH° = (-231.2) - (12 -53) ?

Wait, no, wait. The formula is sum(products) - sum(reactants). So it's [sum products] - [sum reactants].

So sum products is (-231.2), sum reactants is 12 + (2*(-26.5)) = 12 -53 = -41. So,

ΔH° = (-231.2) - (-41) = (-231.2) +41 = -190.2 kcal.

Wait, that's a big number. But looking at the options, the closest is option A: -120, D: -151.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made an error in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, 4 moles of H2O(g): 4*(-57.8) = 4*57.8 is 231.2 with a negative sign, so -231.2.

Reactants: N2H4 is 12, H2O2 is 2*(-26.5)= -53. So 12 -53 = -41.

So products sum is -231.2, reactants sum is -41.

ΔH° = (-231.2) - (-41) = (-231.2 +41) = -190.2 kcal/mol.

Hmm, but the options don't have a -190. The closest is D: -151, and J: -200.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ΔHf° of H2O(g). Because if H2O(g) is -57.8, but perhaps I should use a different value. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I confused the sign. Let me double-check the standard enthalpies of formation.

Another approach: Let me get the correct ΔHf° values.

From standard tables:

ΔHf° (N2H4, l): +12.1 kcal/mol (approximately)
ΔHf° (H2O2, l): -26.5 kcal/mol
ΔHf° (N2, g): 0
ΔHf° (H2O, g): -57.8 kcal/mol (yes, that's correct)

So the calculation is correct. Then ΔH° is -190.2 kcal/mol.

But none of the options match this. The options are:

A: -120

B: 12

C: -57.8

D: -151

E:33.5

F:-75

G:-46

H:97.3

I:62.1

J:-200

So my calculation gives -190.2, which is closest to J: -200. But it's not exact.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the stoichiometry. Let me check the balanced equation again.

The reaction is: 1 N2H4 + 2 H2O2 → 1 N2 + 4 H2O.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the ΔHf° for H2O2 is different. Maybe it's -32 kcal/mol instead of -26.5. Let me think. I'm not 100% sure about the exact value. If H2O2(l) is -32, then:

sum reactants: 12 + 2*(-32) = 12 -64 = -52.

sum products: 0 + 4*(-57.8)= -231.2.

ΔH = (-231.2) - (-52) = -179.2.

Still not matching any options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ΔHf° for N2H4 is different. Maybe it's +12.1, but perhaps I should use another value. Wait, I think another source says N2H4(l) has ΔHf° of +51.7 kJ/mol. Wait, but that's in kJ, and the question uses kcal.

Wait, 51.7 kJ is about 12.35 kcal (since 1 kcal ≈ 4.184 kJ). So 51.7 /4.184 ≈ 12.35 kcal. So yes, that's about +12.4 kcal/mol. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the ΔHf° for H2O2 is actually -32 kcal/mol. Let me see. If that's the case, then the reactants sum would be 12 + 2*(-32) = 12 -64 = -52.

Then, products sum is 0 +4*(-57.8) = -231.2.

ΔH = (-231.2) - (-52) = -179.2.

Still not matching any options. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the reaction is written as N2H4 + 2 H2O2 → N2 + 4 H2O.

But perhaps the sign is opposite. Wait, no, because the formula is products minus reactants.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ΔHf° for H2O(g) is positive. No, that can't be right because forming water from elements releases heat, so it's negative.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake with the calculation.

Let me recalculate:

sum products: 4 * (-57.8) = -231.2.

sum reactants: 1*(12) + 2*(-26.5) = 12 -53 = -41.

ΔH = (-231.2) - (-41) = -190.2.

But none of the options are close to this. So perhaps my ΔHf° values are incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the enthalpy change per mole of reaction as written, which is what I calculated. So perhaps I should check the options again.

Wait, option D is -151, and option J is -200.

My calculation is -190.2, which is between -200 and -151. Hmm.

Is there a possibility that I have the signs wrong for the ΔHf° of the reactants?

Wait, the reaction is exothermic, so the ΔH should be negative, which it is.

Alternatively, perhaps the ΔHf° for H2O(g) is actually +57.8 kcal/mol, but that can't be right because that would mean forming water vapor has a positive ΔH, which contradicts because it's exothermic when formed from elements.

Wait, perhaps I should use the ΔHf° in kJ instead of kcal. Let me think. For example, ΔHf° for H2O(g) is 242 kJ/mol? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question expects me to use the standard enthalpy of formation for H2O as a liquid and then add the heat of vaporization. But in the reaction, H2O is produced as gas, so perhaps I should account for that.

Wait, no, because we already used the ΔHf° for H2O(g), which includes the energy up to the gas state.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate using kJ and then convert.

Wait, let me try that. Let's get all values in kJ:

ΔHf° (N2H4, l): +12.1 kcal/mol = +50.6 kJ/mol (since 1 kcal=4.184 kJ, 12.1 *4.184 ≈ 50.6).

ΔHf° (H2O2, l): -26.5 kcal = -110.3 kJ.

ΔHf° (N2, g)=0.

ΔHf° (H2O, g)= -57.8 kcal = -241.3 kJ (because 57.8 *4.184≈ 241.3).

So sum products: 0 + 4*(-241.3) = -965.2 kJ.

Sum reactants: 50.6 + 2*(-110.3) = 50.6 -220.6 = -170 kJ.

ΔH = (-965.2) - (-170) = -795.2 kJ.

Convert to kcal: 795.2 /4.184 ≈ 190.1 kcal.

So ΔH is -190.1 kcal, same as before.

No options match this, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the heat of reaction is per mole of fuel, or per mole of something else. The question says "per mole", but per mole of what? The reaction as written is per one mole of N2H4.

Wait, perhaps I should check the standard enthalpies again. Maybe I have the wrong values.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is written in a way that the stoichiometric coefficients are different. Let me check the equation again: N2H4(l) + 2 H2O2(l) → N2(g) + 4 H2O(g
