Okay, so I've got this economics question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out which statement is positive. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that in economics, positive statements are those that can be tested or observed; they're factual and not based on opinions or value judgments. Normative statements, on the other hand, involve value judgments or opinions about what should be.

Looking at the question, I need to find the option that presents a positive statement. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: "The law of increasing costs leads to a downward sloping production possibilities frontier." Wait, I think the production possibilities frontier (PPF) is usually drawn as concave to the origin because of increasing costs. So if increasing costs are involved, the PPF should have that shape. But I'm not sure if this is a positive statement. It sounds like it's stating a fact based on economic principles. So maybe this is positive.

Option B: "Nations should concentrate their resources on producing wholesome consumer goods as opposed to the weapons of war." The word "should" indicates a value judgment. This is suggesting what nations ought to do, which is a normative statement.

Option C: "The production possibilities frontier is linear due to constant costs." If costs are constant, the PPF would be linear, right? Because there's no increasing or decreasing costs. But I'm not sure if this is a positive statement or not. It's stating a fact about the shape, so perhaps it's positive. But I think in reality, most PPFs are concave because of increasing costs, so maybe this is incorrect, but the statement itself might still be positive if it's a factual assertion.

Option D: "The production possibilities frontier is convex to the origin because of the law of decreasing costs." Wait, I thought it's the opposite. The PPF is usually concave because of increasing costs, not decreasing. So if this statement is claiming convexity due to decreasing costs, that might be factually incorrect. But whether it's positive or not? It's making a factual claim, so it's a positive statement, even if it's wrong.

Option E: "An economy that produces more butter than guns is better off than an economy that produces more guns than butter." The word "better" is a value judgment. So this is normative.

Option F: "The law of diminishing returns applies to the production of both consumer goods and weapons." Diminishing returns happen when adding more units of a variable input results in smaller increases in output. This applies widely, so this is a factual statement. So this would be a positive statement.

Option G: "Nations ought to devote at least some of their resources to national defense." The word "ought" means it's a recommendation, so it's normative.

Option H: "Nations should prioritize military production to ensure their national security." Again, "should" makes this a value judgment, so normative.

Option I: "An economy that produces more guns than butter is worse off than an economy that produces more butter than guns." The term "worse off" is subjective, so this is a normative statement.

Option J: "The production possibilities frontier is concave to the origin because of the law of increasing costs." This sounds correct. The PPF is concave (curving inward) because as you produce more of one good, the opportunity cost increases. So this is a positive statement because it's a factual explanation based on the law of increasing costs.

Wait, let me clarify. The question is which statement is positive, so it's about whether it's a fact or value-based.

So, positive statements are A, C, D, F, J. The others are normative.

Now, looking back at each option. The correct positive statements among them are likely F and J, and maybe A and C.

Wait, but the question is which of the following statements is positive. So I need to pick the correct option.

Wait, but the question isn't about correctness; it's about whether the statement is positive (factual) or normative (value-based).

So among the options, I need to find which options are positive.

Looking again, the options that are positive are those that don't involve value judgments. So, for example:

A: Talks about the law of increasing costs leading to a downward sloping PPF. Wait, I think the PPF doesn't slope downward; it's typically concave. So maybe A is incorrect, but it's making a factual claim, so it's a positive statement.

C: Linear PPF due to constant costs. That's a factual statement about the shape, so positive.

D: Convex due to decreasing costs. That's a factual claim, so positive, though incorrect.

F: Diminishing returns apply to both. That's a positive statement.

J: Concave due to increasing costs. Correct and positive.

So now, the question is which of these is positive.

But the question is asking which statement is positive, and each option is a statement. So all of A, C, D, F, J are positive, but which one is correct as a positive statement.

Wait, no, the question isn't about correctness, just whether it's positive. So any of these that are making factual claims without value judgments are positive.

But the question is, which of the following statements is positive. So, for example, B, E, G, H, I are normative. The rest are positive. So now, looking at the options, I need to pick the correct positive statement.

Wait, but the question isn't about correctness of the statement, just whether it's positive. So the answer could be any of the options A, C, D, F, J.

Wait, but the problem is that the question is asking which is positive, not which is correct. So for example, if an option makes a factual claim (even if wrong), it's positive. So I need to find which of the options is a positive statement.

Looking back, the options that are positive are A, C, D, F, J.

But the question is to select the correct answer, which is one of the options. So perhaps the correct answer is F or J.

Wait, looking at the question again, perhaps only one of them is correct as a positive statement.

Wait, but the question is asking which is a positive statement, not which is correct.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: the question is asking which of the options is a positive statement. So I need to pick the option that is a positive statement, regardless of whether it's correct.

So, for example, option F says the law of diminishing returns applies to both consumer goods and weapons. That's a positive statement because it's a factual claim about economics.

Option J states that the PPF is concave because of increasing costs. That's also a positive statement.

So the question is to select the option that is positive, not necessarily correct.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "Which of the following statements is positive?" So the answer is the option that is a positive statement (fact-based) rather than a normative one.

So among the options, the positive statements are A, C, D, F, J.

Now, looking at each of these, which one is correct as a positive statement.

Wait, but perhaps the question is just about identifying which is positive, not whether it's correct. So the answer would be any of those options, but the question expects one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the option that is a positive statement. Let's see.

Option F: The law of diminishing returns applies to both consumer goods and weapons. That's a positive statement because it's stating a fact about production.

Option J: The PPF is concave because of increasing costs. That's a positive statement.

So both F and J are positive statements.

Wait, but the question is asking which is positive, so perhaps more than one is positive, but the options are from A-J, and we need to select the correct one.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F and J. But the options are single letters, so only one can be correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct positive statements are F and J, but the question is to find which is positive.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct positive statement.

Going back, which statements are positive.

Option A: Law of increasing costs leads to downward sloping PPF. Wait, no, the PPF is typically concave, which is increasing costs. So if the PPF is concave, it's not downward sloping. So maybe A is incorrect as a statement, but it's still positive because it's a factual assertion.

Option J: PPF is concave because of increasing costs. That's correct and positive.

So perhaps J is a correct positive statement.

Wait, but the question is not about correctness, but whether it's positive. So I think all the options except B, E, G, H, I are positive.

But the question is to choose one. So perhaps the correct answer is F or J.

Wait, looking back, the question is about which statement is positive, so I think the answer is F and J.

But perhaps the correct answer is J, because it correctly describes the PPF as concave due to increasing costs, which is a positive statement.

Alternatively, F is also a positive statement because it's a factual claim about diminishing returns.

So perhaps both F and J are positive, but the question expects one answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is J because it correctly describes the PPF, making it a positive statement.

Alternatively, let's think about each option.

Option F: Diminishing returns apply to both. That's correct because in production, adding more units leads to less output per unit. So this is a positive statement.

Option J: Concave PPF because of increasing costs. Also correct and positive.

So both are positive.

But since the question asks for which is positive, perhaps both F and J are positive, but the options only allow one choice. So perhaps I should look for which one is among the options.

Wait, the options are A to J, and each is a separate option. So the correct answer is either F or J.

But the question is phrased as "which of the following statements is positive," implying that only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the other options are incorrect as positive statements. Let's see.

Looking again:

Option A: Downward sloping PPF due to increasing costs. I think that's incorrect because PPF is concave, not downward sloping. But the statement is positive.

Option C: Linear PPF due to constant costs. That's a positive statement, but it's incorrect because PPFs are usually concave.

Option D: Convex PPF due to decreasing costs. That's incorrect; convex would imply decreasing costs, but PPFs are concave due to increasing costs.

So, among the options, the correct positive statements are F and J.

But the question is to select one. So perhaps the intended answer is J, as it correctly describes the PPF.

Alternatively, perhaps F is also a correct positive statement.

Wait, the question is which is positive, not which is correct. So any statement that is factual is positive.

So, perhaps the answer is F: The law of diminishing returns applies to both, which is a positive statement.

So now, I'm a bit stuck, but I think the correct answer is F and J.

Wait, let me think again. The question is to choose which is positive, regardless of correctness.

So the correct answer would be F and J are positive, but perhaps only one is an option.

Wait, looking at the options, F says the law of diminishing returns applies to both. That's a positive statement.

J says the PPF is concave because of increasing costs, which is also positive.

So both F and J are positive. But since the options are separate, perhaps the intended answer is F.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F.

But I'm not entirely sure. However, I think the best approach is to select the option that is a positive statement, and both F and J qualify.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F because it's a general principle, while J is specific but also correct.

But since the question is to select one, I'll have to choose between them.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is F because it's about diminishing returns, which is a positive statement.

Wait, I think I've spent too much time thinking. Let me try to make a decision.

The correct positive statements are F and J. But looking at the options, perhaps the intended answer is F.

Wait, no, I think J is a positive statement as well.

Alternatively, I think the correct answer is J.

To determine which statement is positive, we first need to distinguish between positive and normative statements. Positive statements are factual, testable, and based on objective observations, while normative statements involve value judgments or opinions about what should be.

### Analysis of Each Option:

- **A**: "The law of increasing costs leads to a downward sloping production possibilities frontier."  
  This is a factual statement about economic principles, making it positive. However, it is factually incorrect because the production possibilities frontier (PPF) is typically concave, not downward sloping, due to increasing costs.

- **B**: "Nations should concentrate their resources on producing wholesome consumer goods as opposed to the weapons of war."  
  The word "should" indicates a value judgment, making this a normative statement.

- **C**: "The production possibilities frontier is linear due to constant costs."  
  This is a factual statement about the shape of the PPF, making it positive. However, it is factually incorrect because PPFs are usually concave due to increasing costs, not linear.

- **D**: "The production possibilities frontier is convex to the origin because of the law of decreasing costs."  
  This is a factual statement about the shape of the PPF, making it positive. However, it is factually incorrect because PPFs are concave due to increasing costs, not convex due to decreasing costs.

- **E**: "An economy that produces more butter than guns is better off than an economy that produces more guns than butter."  
  The term "better off" is a value judgment, making this a normative statement.

- **F**: "The law of diminishing returns applies to the production of both consumer goods and weapons."  
  This is a factual statement about economic principles, making it positive. It is also correct because diminishing returns apply universally in production.

- **G**: "Nations ought to devote at least some of their resources to national defense."  
  The word "ought" indicates a value judgment, making this a normative statement.

- **H**: "Nations should prioritize military production to ensure their national security."  
  The word "should" indicates a value judgment, making this a normative statement.

- **I**: "An economy that produces more guns than butter is worse off than an economy that produces more butter than guns."  
  The term "worse off" is a value judgment, making this a normative statement.

- **J**: "The production possibilities frontier is concave to the origin because of the law of increasing costs."  
  This is a factual statement about the shape of the PPF, making it positive. It is also correct because the PPF is concave due to increasing costs.

### Conclusion:
The positive statements are **A**, **C**, **D**, **F**, and **J**. Among these, **F** and **J** are correct as well as positive. However, since the question asks for a single answer, **F** is the best choice because it is a general and universally correct positive statement.
