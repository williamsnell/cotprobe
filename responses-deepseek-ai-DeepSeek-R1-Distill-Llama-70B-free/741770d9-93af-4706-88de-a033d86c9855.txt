Question:

A 76-year-old man comes to the office because of early awakening at night. He has no difficulty falling asleep but routinely wakes up between 2:00 and 3:00 AM. The patient is a retired postal worker, and he has always been physically active. He has diabetes mellitus controlled by diet. The patient drinks one cup of coffee in the morning with breakfast and usually walks for exercise in the morning. Before retiring at night he has one alcoholic beverage. He has no history of depression, nightmares, or snoring and he takes no over-the-counter medications. His wife of 45 years is also in good health. Vital signs are temperature 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse 96/min and regular, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 135/90 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a well-nourished, well-developed man. He is not obese. Examination of the head and neck is normal; there are no bruits or jugular venous distention. Chest is clear, and heart is normal with S1 and S2. Abdomen is soft and nontender with active bowel sounds and no organomegaly. Rectal examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate management of this patient's insomnia?

Options:

A: Recommend the patient to watch television before going to bed.
B: Prescribe sleeping pills
C: Advise the patient to read and snack in bed to relax
D: Recommend a daytime nap to compensate for lost sleep
E: Prescribe a vigorous pre-bedtime exercise regimen
F: Prescribe sertraline
G: Prescribe a low-carb diet
H: Advise the patient to discontinue his bedtime drink of alcohol
I: Advise the patient to drink alcohol earlier in the day
J: Advise the patient to increase his intake of caffeine

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best answer to this question about insomnia in an elderly man. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.

The patient is a 76-year-old man who comes in because he's been waking up early, around 2 or 3 AM. He doesn't have trouble falling asleep, which is different from some other sleep issues like insomnia where people have trouble falling asleep in the first place. He's a retired postal worker, physically active, and has controlled diabetes through diet. 

Looking at his habits: he drinks one cup of coffee in the morning with breakfast. That's probably not too much caffeine, but I know caffeine can affect sleep, especially if consumed later in the day. He walks in the morning for exercise, which is good. Before bed, he has one alcoholic beverage. He doesn't have a history of depression, nightmares, or snoring, so sleep apnea might be less likely here, though not impossible. His wife is healthy, so no immediate stressors there.

Vital signs show a slightly elevated pulse of 96, but other signs are normal. Physical exam is unremarkable—no signs of heart failure or other issues. So, probably not a medical condition causing the insomnia. His abdomen is normal, so no GI issues that might cause him to wake up.

The question is about the most appropriate management for his insomnia. The options are from A to J.

Let me think about common causes of early morning awakening. It can be related to depression, but he has no history of that. It can also be due to sleep disorders, but he doesn't snore, so maybe not sleep apnea. Another possibility is lifestyle factors affecting his sleep.

He consumes alcohol before bed. Alcohol is known to disrupt sleep patterns. It can help people fall asleep faster, but it often leads to lighter, less restorative sleep and can cause early awakenings. So that might be a contributing factor here. Also, caffeine in the morning is probably not the issue since he only has one cup and it's in the morning, but I should keep that in mind.

So, looking at the options, the advice to discontinue the bedtime alcohol might help. Let's look at each option.

Option A: Watch TV before bed. That's generally not good because screen time can interfere with sleep. The blue light can suppress melatonin, and stimulating activities before bed aren't recommended. So A is probably not a good choice.

Option B: Prescribe sleeping pills. Sleeping aids can be considered, but they're usually recommended for short-term use, especially in the elderly, due to risks of dependency and side effects. Plus, the patient's issue seems related to habits, so addressing that first makes sense.

Option C: Read and snack in bed. That's bad because it associates the bed with being awake. It's better to use the bed only for sleep and sex. So C is not good.

Option D: Daytime nap. Napping can sometimes interfere with nighttime sleep, especially if it's too long or too late in the day. Since he's waking up early, maybe a short nap could help, but it's not the best first approach.

Option E: Vigorous exercise before bed. Exercise is good, but doing it too close to bedtime can actually interfere with sleep for some people, making it harder to fall asleep. So E might not be the best choice.

Option F: Sertraline. That's an SSRI, used for depression. Since there's no history of depression, this might not be appropriate unless there's an underlying issue not mentioned.

Option G: Low-carb diet. I don't see how that directly relates to insomnia. His diabetes is controlled, so maybe managing blood sugar could help, but that's a stretch.

Option H: Discontinue bedtime alcohol. That seems promising because alcohol can disrupt sleep patterns. Stopping it might help him sleep more soundly and not wake up as early.

Option I: Drink alcohol earlier. That might help reduce the immediate effects of alcohol on sleep. But if he stops drinking before bed, that's better than just shifting the time. Plus, the question is about management, so advising to stop might be better than just adjusting the timing.

Option J: Increase caffeine. That's a bad idea because more caffeine could interfere with sleep, making it harder to fall asleep or stay asleep. He already has one cup in the morning, so adding more is not advisable.

So, the best options seem to be H and I. Between these, H is advising to discontinue the bedtime alcohol, which directly addresses the potential cause. I suggests moving the alcohol earlier, but if he stops having it before bed, that's more effective. Plus, the question states he has one alcoholic beverage before retiring, so stopping it would be a better recommendation than just moving it.

Therefore, the correct answer is H.

The patient is a 76-year-old man experiencing early morning awakenings without difficulty falling asleep. He has no history of depression, nightmares, or snoring, and his physical examination is unremarkable. His habits include one cup of coffee in the morning, morning walks, and one alcoholic beverage before bed. The key factor likely contributing to his insomnia is the alcohol consumption before bedtime, as alcohol can disrupt sleep patterns and lead to early awakenings.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, C, E, F, G, J**: These options involve activities or interventions that are either counterproductive for sleep (e.g., screen time, vigorous exercise before bed, increasing caffeine) or unrelated to the issue (e.g., low-carb diet, sertraline for depression).  
- **B**: Prescribing sleeping pills is not ideal due to potential side effects and dependency risks, especially in the elderly.  
- **D**: Daytime naps could interfere with nighttime sleep and are not the best first-line approach.  
- **I**: While drinking alcohol earlier in the day might reduce its immediate effects on sleep, discontinuing bedtime alcohol is a more direct and effective intervention.  

The most appropriate management is to advise the patient to discontinue his bedtime drink of alcohol, as this directly addresses the likely cause of his insomnia.

**Answer: H**
