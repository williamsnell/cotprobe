Okay, so I've got this problem here about a publisher's breakeven point. Hmm, I remember that breakeven point is when the total revenue equals the total costs, right? So, the point where the business isn't making a profit or a loss. 

Let me read the question again. The publisher has fixed daily costs of $300. His books sell for $1.00 each, and they cost him 75 cents a piece. I need to find the breakeven point in terms of how many books he needs to sell.

Wait, so fixed costs are $300. That's the money he spends regardless of how many books he sells, like rent or salaries maybe. Then, each book has a selling price of $1, which is the revenue per unit. But wait, the cost per book is 75 cents. So for each book, he spends 75 cents, which is $0.75.

I think the formula for breakeven point is the fixed costs divided by the contribution margin per unit. Oh right, contribution margin is the selling price minus the variable cost per unit. So I'll calculate that first.

So, selling price per book is $1.00, variable cost is $0.75. So the contribution margin is 1.00 - 0.75 = $0.25 per book. 

Then, the breakeven point in units is the fixed costs divided by this contribution margin. So fixed costs are $300. So 300 divided by 0.25. Let me calculate that.

300 divided by 0.25... Hmm, 0.25 goes into 1 four times, so 300 times 4 would be 1200. So that's 1200 books.

Wait, let me double-check. Each book gives a profit of 25 cents after covering the variable cost. So to cover $300 fixed costs, how many 25 cents do I need? 300 / 0.25 = 1200. Yep, that makes sense.

Looking at the options, option A is 1200 books. So the answer should be A.

I think that's correct. But wait, fixed costs are daily, so this is the number he needs to sell each day to break even. Right, because the question says "fixed daily costs", so the breakeven is per day.
</think>

To determine the breakeven point, we calculate the number of books the publisher must sell daily to cover both fixed and variable costs. The breakeven formula is:

\[
\text{Breakeven Point (in units)} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Contribution Margin per Unit}}
\]

1. **Fixed Costs**: $300 per day.
2. **Selling Price per Book**: $1.00.
3. **Variable Cost per Book**: $0.75.
4. **Contribution Margin per Unit**: \( 1.00 - 0.75 = 0.25 \) (or 25 cents per book).

Using the formula:

\[
\text{Breakeven Point} = \frac{300}{0.25} = 1200 \text{ books}.
\]

Thus, the publisher must sell **1,200 books daily** to break even. Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A: 1,200 books**
