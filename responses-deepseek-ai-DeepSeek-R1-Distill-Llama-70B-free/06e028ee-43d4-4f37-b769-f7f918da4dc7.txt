Okay, so I have this problem about a constant-volume perfect gas thermometer. Hmm, I remember that a gas thermometer works using the ideal gas law somehow. Let me think. Oh right, for a constant volume, the pressure is directly proportional to the temperature in Kelvin. So the formula should be P1/T1 = P2/T2, right?

The problem says that at the triple point of water, which is 273.16 K, the pressure is 6.69 kPa. And we need to find the pressure when the temperature is 100 degrees Celsius. Oh wait, I need to convert that to Kelvin. So 100 C is 373.15 K because 273.15 + 100 = 373.15.

So using the formula P1/T1 = P2/T2. Let's plug in the known values. P1 is 6.69 kPa, T1 is 273.16 K. T2 is 373.15 K. I need to find P2.

So P2 = P1 * (T2 / T1). Let me calculate that. 6.69 multiplied by (373.15 / 273.16). Let me compute the fraction first. 373.15 divided by 273.16 is approximately... let's see, 373/273 is about 1.366, maybe a bit more precise. Let me calculate 373.15 divided by 273.16. 

Wait, 273.16 times 1.36 is about 371. So 373.15 is a little higher, so maybe around 1.366. Let me do the division more accurately. 373.15 รท 273.16. Let me approximate: 273.16 * 1.366 is around 373. So yeah, about 1.366.

So 6.69 kPa multiplied by 1.366. Let's compute that. 6.69 * 1.366. Hmm, 6 times 1.366 is 8.196. Then 0.69 *1.366: 0.6 *1.366 is 0.8196, and 0.09 *1.366 is about 0.12294. Adding those gives 0.8196 + 0.12294 = 0.94254. So total is 8.196 + 0.94254 = 9.13854. Approximately 9.14 kPa.

Looking at the options, option I is 9.14 kPa. So the answer should be I.

To solve the problem, we use the relationship for a constant-volume gas thermometer, where pressure is directly proportional to temperature in Kelvin:  

\[
\frac{P_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2}{T_2}
\]

Here:  
- \( P_1 = 6.69 \, \mathrm{kPa} \), \( T_1 = 273.16 \, \mathrm{K} \) (triple point of water),  
- \( T_2 = 100.00^\circ \mathrm{C} = 373.15 \, \mathrm{K} \), and \( P_2 \) is the unknown pressure.  

Rearranging for \( P_2 \):  

\[
P_2 = P_1 \cdot \frac{T_2}{T_1}
\]

Substituting the values:  

\[
P_2 = 6.69 \cdot \frac{373.15}{273.16}
\]

First, calculate the ratio \( \frac{373.15}{273.16} \approx 1.366 \). Then:  

\[
P_2 = 6.69 \cdot 1.366 \approx 9.14 \, \mathrm{kPa}
\]

From the given options, the closest match is **9.14 kPa**, which corresponds to option **I**.
