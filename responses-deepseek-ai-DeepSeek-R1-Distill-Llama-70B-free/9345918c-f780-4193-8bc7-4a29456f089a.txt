Okay, so I've got a chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's about finding the pKa of a weak monoprotic acid based on the pH of its solution. Alright, I remember that weak acids don't completely dissociate in water, so I probably need to use some equilibrium expressions here.

The problem states that 0.0025 moles of the weak acid are dissolved in 0.250 liters of water. The pH is measured as 4.26, and I need to find the pKa. The options are given from A to J.

So, first things first, I should probably calculate the concentration of the acid. Moles divided by volume gives concentration. So 0.0025 mol over 0.250 L. Let me compute that. 0.0025 divided by 0.25 is 0.01 M. So the concentration of the acid is 0.01 M.

Since it's a weak acid, it will partially ionize in water. The ionization can be represented as HA ⇌ H+ + A-. At equilibrium, the concentrations will be: HA is approximately 0.01 minus x, and H+ and A- are both x each. But wait, the pH is 4.26, so [H+] is 10^-4.26. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 10^-4 is 0.0001, and 10^-0.26 is about 0.55 (since 10^0.26 ≈ 1.8, so 1/1.8 ≈ 0.55). So 0.0001 * 0.55 is approximately 5.5e-5 M. So [H+] is about 5.5e-5 M.

Wait, but the initial calculation assumed that x is small compared to 0.01. Let's check if that holds. If x is 5.5e-5, then 0.01 is 0.010 M. So x is 0.000055, which is much smaller than 0.01, so the assumption that 0.01 - x ≈ 0.01 is valid. So I don't need to use the quadratic equation here because the approximation holds.

So the concentration of H+ is x = 5.5e-5 M. Since the acid is monoprotic, the concentration of A- is also x. So the Ka expression would be [H+][A-]/[HA] = (x)(x)/(0.01) = x² / 0.01.

I can plug in the value of x. So x is 5.5e-5, so x squared is (5.5e-5)^2 = (5.5)^2 * (1e-10) = 30.25e-10 = 3.025e-9. Then, dividing by 0.01 gives 3.025e-9 / 0.01 = 3.025e-7. So Ka is approximately 3.025e-7.

Wait, but wait. Let me get more precise with the calculation. Maybe I approximated [H+] too much. Let me compute 10^-4.26 more accurately. Let's see, 4.26 is 4 + 0.26. So 10^-4 is 1e-4, and 10^-0.26 is... Hmm, let me think. Log(2)=0.3010, so 0.26 is just a bit less than that. So 10^-0.26 is approximately 0.548. So [H+] is 1e-4 * 0.548 ≈ 5.48e-5 M. So x is 5.48e-5.

Then, x^2 is (5.48e-5)^2. Let me compute that. 5.48 squared is about 30.02, so 30.02e-10, which is 3.002e-9. Then, 3.002e-9 divided by 0.01 is 3.002e-7. So Ka is approximately 3.002e-7.

Wait, but wait again. Let's be precise. Maybe I should use exact calculations. Let me compute [H+] exactly. pH = 4.26, so [H+] = 10^(-4.26) = 10^(-4 - 0.26) )= 1e-4 * 10^(-0.26). Let me compute 10^(-0.26) using calculator steps. Hmm, 0.26 can be thought as log(1.82) because 10^0.26 is about 1.82. So 10^-0.26 is 1/1.82 ≈ 0.549. So [H+] is 1e-4 * 0.549 =5.49e-5 M.

So x is 5.49e-5. Then x squared is (5.49e-5)^2 = (5.49)^2 *1e-10. 5.49 squared is 30.14 (since 5*5=25, 5*.49*2=4.9, 0.49^2=0.24, so 25+4.9+0.24=30.14). So 30.14e-10 is 3.014e-9. Then, divide by 0.01 gives 3.014e-7, so Ka is approximately 3.014e-7.

Now, pKa is the negative log of Ka. So pKa = -log(3.014e-7). Let me compute that. The log of 3.014e-7 is log(3.014) + log(1e-7). Log(3.014) is about 0.478, so log(3.014e-7) is 0.478 -7 = -6.522. So pKa is 6.522.

Wait, no. Because pKa is the negative of that. So pKa = 6.522. Looking at the options, let's see. Option E is 6.52, which matches. So the answer should be E.

Wait another thing, but wait, when I calculated Ka, I assumed that [HA] is approximately 0.01 M. Is that correct? Let me check. The initial concentration is 0.01 M. If x is 5.49e-5, then 0.01 - x is 0.00945 M, which is about 0.00945, which is approximately 0.01. The approximation holds because x is small compared to 0.01 (5.5e-5 is about 0.55% of 0.01), so the assumption is valid.

Alternatively, if I didn't make that approximation, I would set up the equation:

Ka = (x^2)/(0.01 - x). Let's plug in x=5.49e-5.

Ka = (5.49e-5)^2 / (0.01 -5.49e-5) = (3.014e-9) / (9.4501e-3) )= 3.014e-9 / 9.4501e-3 ≈ 3.19e-7. Wait, that's a bit different. Hmm, wait, no. Let me compute that accurately.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in the calculation: (5.49e-5)^2 is 3.014e-9, and denominator is 0.01 -5.49e-5 = 0.0094501. So 0.0094501 is approx 0.00945. So 3.014e-9 / 0.00945 = approx 3.014e-9 / 9.45e-3 = (3.014 / 9.45) * 1e-6 = approximately 0.319 * 1e-6 = 3.19e-7.

Wait, that's different from the earlier 3.014e-7. So if I use the exact denominator, Ka becomes 3.19e-7, which would change the pKa.

But wait, am I overcomplicating this? Because the initial assumption is that x is negligible compared to 0.01, which is 0.55% of 0.01, so 0.55% error. So the approximation is acceptable, but perhaps including the exact term gives a more precise value.

So, let's see: if I use the exact denominator:

Ka = (5.49e-5)^2 / (0.01 - 5.49e-5) = (3.014e-9) / (0.0094501) = approximately 3.014e-9 / 0.00945 = approx 3.19e-7.

Then, pKa is -log(3.19e-7) = ?

Log(3.19e-7) is log(3.19) + (-7). Log(3.19) is about 0.504, so log is 0.504 -7 = -6.496. So pKa is 6.496, which is approximately 6.50. Hmm, but none of the options exactly match that, except option E is 6.52. Wait, earlier when I used the approximation, I got pKa of 6.52, which matches option E. So perhaps the exact value is close to 6.50, but considering possible rounding, it would be about 6.52.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use the exact expression without approximation. Let me think again.

The acid dissociation expression: HA ⇌ H+ + A-. At equilibrium:

[HA] = 0.01 - x

[H+] = x = 1e-4.26 ≈ 5.49e-5 M.

So x is 5.49e-5.

Ka = (x^2)/(0.01 - x) = (5.49e-5)^2 / (0.01 -5.49e-5) = (3.014e-9) / (0.0094501) = approximately 3.19e-7.

Wait, so that's different than before. So now, pKa is -log(3.19e-7) = ?

Log(3.19e-7) = log(3.19) + log(1e-7) = 0.504 -7 = -6.496 → pKa = 6.496 ≈ 6.50.

But the options don't have 6.50. Wait, looking back, option E is 6.52, which is very close. So perhaps the approximation is sufficient, and the correct answer is E.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact value requires a more precise calculation.

Wait, let me compute [H+] more accurately. Let me compute 10^-4.26 precisely. Let's use a calculator approach.

pH = 4.26 → [H+] = 10^(-4.26).

Using a calculator: 4.26 in exponent terms.

Let me compute 10^(-4.26) = 1/(10^4.26) = 1/(10^4 * 10^0.26).

10^0.26: Let me compute that. 10^0.26 is approximately 1.82 because 10^0.3 ≈ 2 (since log10(2)=0.3010), so 0.26 is a bit less than 0.3, so say 1.82.

So 10^4.26 = 10^4 * 1.82 = 10000 * 1.82 = 18200. So 1/18200 ≈ 5.4945e-5 M. So [H+] = 5.4945e-5 M.

So x = 5.4945e-5 M.

Then, x squared is (5.4945e-5)^2 = (5.4945)^2 * 1e-10. 5.4945 squared is approximately 30.16, so x² = 30.16e-10 = 3.016e-9.

Denominator is 0.01 - x = 0.01 - 5.4945e-5. Let's compute 0.01 as 0.009999999... So 0.01 - 0.000054945 = 0.009945055 M.

So Ka = 3.016e-9 / 0.009945055 ≈ 3.031e-7.

Wait, let me compute that division accurately.

3.016e-9 / 0.009945055 = (3.016 / 0.009945055) * 1e-9 / 1e-2 → Wait, no, 0.009945055 is in M, same as denominator.

Wait, 3.016e-9 divided by 0.009945055 is (3.016 / 9.945055) ) * 1e-7.

Because 3.016e-9 / 0.009945055 = (3.016 / 9945.055) ) * 1e-9 * 1e3 → wait, perhaps better to compute it as (3.016e-9) / (9.945055e-3) = (3.016 /9.945055) ) * 1e-6 → 0.3031 * 1e-6 → 3.031e-7.

So Ka is approximately 3.03e-7. Then, pKa is -log(3.03e-7).

Log(3.03e-7) = log(3.03) + (-7). Log(3.03) is approximately 0.4829. So log is 0.4829 -7 = -6.5171. So pKa is 6.5171, which is approximately 6.52.

So that brings me back to option E, which is 6.52.

Therefore, the correct answer should be E.

To determine the pKa of the weak, monoprotic acid, we start by calculating the initial concentration of the acid. The problem states that 0.0025 moles of the acid are dissolved in 0.250 L of water, so the concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acid} = \frac{0.0025 \, \text{mol}}{0.250 \, \text{L}} = 0.01 \, \text{M}.
\]

The pH of the solution is given as 4.26, so the concentration of \([H^+]\) is:

\[
[H^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-4.26}.
\]

Breaking this down, \(10^{-4.26} = 10^{-4} \cdot 10^{-0.26}\). Using approximations, \(10^{-0.26} \approx 0.549\), so:

\[
[H^+] = 10^{-4} \cdot 0.549 = 5.49 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]

Since the acid is weak and monoprotic, its ionization can be represented as:

\[
\text{HA} \leftrightharpoons \text{H}^+ + \text{A}^-.
\]

At equilibrium:
- \([H^+] = [\text{A}^-] = 5.49 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}\),
- \([\text{HA}] \approx 0.01 - [H^+] \approx 0.01 \, \text{M}\) (since \([H^+]\) is small compared to 0.01 M).

The acid dissociation constant \(K_a\) is given by:

\[
K_a = \frac{[H^+][\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} = \frac{(5.49 \times 10^{-5})^2}{0.01}.
\]

First, calculate \((5.49 \times 10^{-5})^2\):

\[
(5.49 \times 10^{-5})^2 = 3.014 \times 10^{-9}.
\]

Now divide by \(0.01\):

\[
K_a = \frac{3.014 \times 10^{-9}}{0.01} = 3.014 \times 10^{-7}.
\]

The pKa is the negative logarithm of \(K_a\):

\[
\text{pKa} = -\log(K_a) = -\log(3.014 \times 10^{-7}).
\]

Breaking this down, \(\log(3.014 \times 10^{-7}) = \log(3.014) + \log(10^{-7})\). Using \(\log(3.014) \approx 0.478\), we get:

\[
\log(3.014 \times 10^{-7}) = 0.478 - 7 = -6.522.
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{pKa} = 6.522.
\]

From the given options, the closest value is **6.52**, which corresponds to **option E**.

Answer: E
