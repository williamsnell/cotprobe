Question:

Milgram (1965) found that participants in his study were more willing to administer electric shocks to another person when they couldn't see the victim and the victim couldn't see them. This ﬁnding is predicted by Zimbardo’s notion of:

A: bystander effect.
B: conformity.
C: psychological reactance.
D: self-perception.
E: self-verification.
F: groupthink.
G: deindividuation.
H: social facilitation.
I: cognitive dissonance.
J: pluralistic ignorance.

Okay, so I've got this psychology question here, and I'm a bit new to the subject, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about Milgram's 1965 study and how it relates to Zimbardo's notion. Hmm, I remember Milgram's study was about obedience, right? He had participants administer electric shocks to another person, and he found that when people couldn't see the victim, they were more willing to give higher shocks.

Wait, the question says that when participants couldn't see the victim and vice versa, they were more likely to administer shocks. So the key point here is the lack of visibility between the participant and the victim. I think this relates to some concept about losing self-awareness or something when people are anonymous.

I remember something about deindividuation from Zimbardo. Deindividuation is when people lose their sense of self and their inhibitions because they're in a group or anonymous. Like, when people are in crowds, they might do things they normally wouldn't because they feel less accountable. That makes sense here because if the participant can't see the victim, maybe they feel more anonymous, more disconnected, so they're willing to inflict more pain.

Wait, let me think about the other options too. The bystander effect is when people don't help because others are around, but this is about obedience and administering shocks, not helping. So probably not A. Conformity is about going along with a group, but Milgram's study was more about obedience to authority, though I'm not sure. Zimbardo's related concepts... oh, right, Zimbardo's Stanford Prison Experiment is where deindividuation came into play with the guards and prisoners.

So in Milgram's case, when the victim is out of sight, it reduces the participant's sense of responsibility, making them more obedient. This seems to tie into deindividuation because the participants feel less identifiable and thus less accountable for their actions.

Wait another thought: in Milgram's variations, when the victim was in another room, the obedience rates were higher. When the victim was visible, especially when the participant had to physically touch the victim, the obedience dropped. So the visual separation leads to higher obedience. So the concept here is about the situation making the person less aware of themselves as individuals, hence deindividuation.

Looking at the options again, the choices are A through J. The options I think are relevant are B (conformity) and G (deindividuation). I have to decide between them. Conformity is about matching others' behavior, but Milgram's setup was more about following orders from an authority figure. But the specific finding here is about visibility affecting behavior.

Zimbardo's deindividuation concept explains that when people are anonymous or not seen, they're more likely to act out of character. So in Milgram's study, not seeing the victim (and vice versa) would make the participant feel less connected, more anonymous, leading to more obedience. So the prediction is from Zimbardo's deindividuation.

Yes, I think the correct answer is G: deindividuation.

The question revolves around Milgram's 1965 study, where participants were more willing to administer electric shocks when they couldn't see the victim and vice versa. This finding is linked to Zimbardo's psychological concepts. The key idea is that the lack of visibility reduces accountability and self-awareness, leading to increased obedience.

Among the options, **deindividuation** stands out as the most relevant concept. Deindividuation, as described by Zimbardo, occurs when individuals lose their sense of self and inhibitions, often due to anonymity or being in a group. In Milgram's study, the physical separation and lack of visibility between the participant and the victim created a sense of anonymity, making participants feel less responsible for their actions. This aligns with Zimbardo's notion of deindividuation, which explains why participants were more likely to administer higher shocks under these conditions.

Other options like conformity or bystander effect are less relevant because they do not directly address the role of anonymity and reduced self-awareness in this specific context.
