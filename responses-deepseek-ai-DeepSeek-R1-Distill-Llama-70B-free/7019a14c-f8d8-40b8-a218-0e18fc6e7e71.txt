Okay, so I've got this economics question here about inflationary gaps and the policies to close them. Hmm, let me try to think through this.

First, I remember that an inflationary gap occurs when aggregate demand exceeds the long-run aggregate supply. This usually happens when the economy is producing above its potential, leading to inflation because too much money is chasing too few goods.

So the goal here is to find policies that reduce aggregate demand. The question gives several options, each listing a combination of monetary and fiscal policies. I need to figure out which combination would decrease AD.

Looking at each option:

Option A: Increase money supply, decrease taxes, increase gov spending. Wait, increasing money supply would lower interest rates and boost investment, increasing AD. Decreasing taxes and increasing government spending also increase AD. So all three would make AD worse. So this isn't the right choice.

Option B: Maintain money supply, decrease taxes, increase gov spending. Maintaining money supply doesn't change AD. Decreasing taxes and increasing spending would increase AD. So that's bad, making the inflationary gap worse.

Option C: Decrease money supply, run a federal deficit. Decreasing money supply would reduce AD. A federal deficit usually means fiscal expansion, which increases AD. So these two policies are working against each other. Not sure if this would close the gap.

Option D: Increase money supply, increase taxes, reduce gov spending. Increasing money supply would increase AD. But increasing taxes and reducing spending would decrease AD. It's a mix of expansionary and contractionary policies. Not sure if overall it reduces AD enough.

Option E: Decrease money supply, decrease taxes, increase gov spending. Decreasing money supply reduces AD, but decreasing taxes and increasing spending increase AD. So again, conflicting policies. Maybe net effect isn't contractionary enough.

Option F: Increase money supply and run a deficit. Both are expansionary, increasing AD. So that's the opposite of what's needed.

Option G: Decrease money supply, increase taxes, reduce gov spending. All three actions are contractionary. Decreasing money supply reduces AD. Increasing taxes takes money out of people's pockets, reducing consumption. Reducing government spending directly lowers AD. So this option seems to be all about reducing AD, which is exactly what we need to close an inflationary gap.

Option H: Increase money supply and run a surplus. Increasing money supply would increase AD, but a surplus (as in, the government saving more) is contractionary. So again, mixed signals. Maybe not enough to close the gap.

So from all the options, it looks like Option G is the correct one. All the policies there are aimed at reducing aggregate demand, which is needed when there's an inflationary gap.

To close an inflationary gap, policies must reduce aggregate demand (AD). An inflationary gap occurs when AD exceeds the economy's long-run potential, leading to inflation. The correct policies should aim to decrease AD through contractionary measures.

- **Option A**: Increasing the money supply expands AD, as does decreasing taxes and increasing government spending. These policies worsen the inflationary gap.
- **Option B**: Maintaining the money supply does not reduce AD, while decreasing taxes and increasing government spending increase AD, exacerbating the gap.
- **Option C**: Decreasing the money supply reduces AD, but running a federal budget deficit increases AD. These policies work against each other.
- **Option D**: Increasing the money supply expands AD, while increasing taxes and reducing government spending contract AD. The mix of expansionary and contractionary policies may not sufficiently reduce AD.
- **Option E**: Decreasing the money supply reduces AD, but decreasing taxes and increasing government spending increase AD, leading to conflicting effects.
- **Option F**: Both increasing the money supply and running a federal deficit expand AD, worsening the inflationary gap.
- **Option G**: Decreasing the money supply reduces AD, increasing taxes lowers consumption, and reducing government spending directly decreases AD. All policies are contractionary, making this the correct choice.
- **Option H**: Increasing the money supply expands AD, while running a federal surplus contracts AD. These policies have mixed effects and may not effectively close the gap.

The only option that consistently implements contractionary policies to reduce AD and close the inflationary gap is **Option G**.
