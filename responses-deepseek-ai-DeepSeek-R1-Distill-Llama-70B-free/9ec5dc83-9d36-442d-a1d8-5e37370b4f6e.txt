C: The probability of a Type I error would stay the same and the power would increase.
D: The probability of a Type II error would decrease and the power would stay the same.
E: The probability of a Type I error would decrease and the probability of a Type II error would increase.
F: The probability of a Type II error and the power would both increase.
G: The power and the probability of a Type II error would both decrease.
H: The probability of a Type I error would increase and the power would decrease.

Okay, so I've got this statistics question to tackle, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of hypothesis testing. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that researchers are conducting an experiment with a significance level of 0.05. The null hypothesis is actually false. So, they're in a situation where they should be rejecting the null, right? Because the null is false, the alternative hypothesis must be true. Now, they're changing their experiment by using twice as many experimental units for each treatment. The question is asking what happens to the Type I error probability and the power of the test.

Hmm, I remember that the significance level (alpha) is the probability of making a Type I error. A Type I error is incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis. So alpha is set before the experiment, and it's 0.05 here. Wait, does changing the sample size affect alpha? I think alpha is a chosen value, so it shouldn't change. So the probability of Type I error stays the same, which is 0.05.

Then, what about the power of the test? Power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it's false. So power depends on several factors, like sample size, effect size, and the significance level. Since they're increasing the sample size, the power should increase because a larger sample reduces sampling error, making it easier to detect a real effect if it exists.

Let me think about the relationship between sample size and Type II errors. A Type II error is failing to reject the null when it's false. The probability of a Type II error is beta, and power is 1-beta. So if power increases, beta decreases. That means the probability of a Type II error goes down.

Wait, so putting it together: increasing sample size doesn't change alpha (Type I error rate), but it increases power (which means lower Type II error rate).

Looking at the options, I need to find the one where Type I error stays the same and power increases.

Option C says: The probability of a Type I error would stay the same and the power would increase. That sounds right.

Let me double-check the other options to be safe.

Option A: Both Type I and power increase. No, Type I doesn't change because alpha is fixed.

Option B: Both Type I and II decrease. No, Type I doesn't change.

Option C: Correct as above.

Option D: Type II decreases and power stays same. No, power should increase, which would mean Type II decreases, but D says power stays same. So no.

Option E: Type I decreases, Type II increases. No, opposite of what happens.

Option F: Type II and power both increase. No, because power increases, Type II (beta) decreases. So F is wrong.

Option G: Power and Type II both decrease. No, power increases, so G is wrong.

Option H: Type I increases, power decreases. No, opposite.

Option I: Power same, Type II decreases. No, power increases.

Option J: Both Type I and II increase. No.

So yes, the correct answer is option C.
</think>

The significance level (Î±) is set by the researcher and remains constant at 0.05, meaning the probability of a Type I error (incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis) does not change. Power, which is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false, increases with sample size because a larger sample reduces sampling error and improves the ability to detect a real effect. Therefore, doubling the number of experimental units increases power while keeping the Type I error rate unchanged.

Option C correctly states that the probability of a Type I error stays the same and the power increases.

Answer: C
