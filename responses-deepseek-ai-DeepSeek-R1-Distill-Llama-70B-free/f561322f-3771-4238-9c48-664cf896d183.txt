Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about solute distribution between two immiscible phases. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem says that a solute is added to a two-phase mixture where the components A and B are completely immiscible. The distribution constant Kd is 508. I need to find the fraction of the solute in phase B at equilibrium.

Wait, the distribution constant, Kd, is the ratio of the concentration of the solute in one phase to the other. Oh right, it's usually Kd = [solute in phase A] / [solute in phase B], or the other way around? I think I might have this backwards. No, wait, the distribution constant can vary depending on how it's defined. Oh yeah, I remember now. Typically, Kd is defined as the concentration of the solute in the organic phase divided by the concentration in the aqueous phase, but sometimes it's the other way. Hmm, so which one are we using here?

But the problem doesn't specify which phase is which, like which is A and which is B. Wait, the question is about the fraction in phase B. So I think I need to get clear on that. Let's say Kd is the concentration in phase A over phase B. Or is it phase B over A? Wait, no, the distribution constant is usually expressed as Kd = (concentration in solvent phase) / (concentration in aqueous phase). Oh wait, but sometimes it's the opposite. Oh, this is a point I need to clarify.

Wait, the problem states that the distribution constant Kd is 508 for the solute between components A and B. So regardless of which is which, the formula should be Kd = [A]/[B], or [B]/[A]? Suppose A is the phase where the solute is more soluble, then Kd would be larger than 1. Since Kd is 508, which is a large number, that suggests that the solute prefers phase A more than phase B. Or wait, does it prefer phase B? Hmm, let's think. If Kd is [A]/[B], and Kd is 508, then [A] is much higher than [B]. So the solute is more concentrated in A. So in phase A, the concentration is higher than in phase B.

But wait, the question is about the fraction in phase B. So if [A] is 508 times [B], then the total amount of solute would be the sum of the amounts in A and B.

Let me think in terms of variables. Let's say the total amount of solute is S. Let x be the amount in phase B. Then the amount in phase A would be S - x.

Wait, but wait, the distribution law is Kd = [A]/[B]. So if Kd is 508, then [A] = 508 [B]. So [A] = 508 x, assuming x is [B]. Or wait, no. Let me get this straight.

Wait, if Kd is defined as [A]/[B], then [A] = Kd * [B]. Suppose [B] is the concentration in phase B. Let me think in terms of concentrations. Let’s say the volume of each phase is the same, but actually, I think the volumes might not matter here because the question is about the fraction of the solute, not the concentrations. Wait, but if the volumes are the same, then the amount in each phase would directly depend on the concentration.

Alternatively, maybe we can model it like this: the total amount of solute is in both phases. Let’s say the amount in phase A is A, and in phase B is B. So A + B = total solute.

The distribution law is A/B = Kd. So A = Kd * B.

So substituting into the first equation: Kd * B + B = total solute. So B (Kd + 1) = total. So B = total / (Kd + 1).

Wait, but the total amount is the original amount, which I can consider as 1 unit for simplicity. So then, the fraction in phase B is 1/(Kd + 1).

In this problem, Kd is 508. So the fraction in B would be 1/(508 + 1) = 1/509 ≈ 0.0019627, which is approximately 1.96 × 10^-3.

Looking at the options, option I is 1.96 × 10^-3 of the original amount. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. What if the distribution constant was defined the other way around? Like Kd = [B]/[A]. If that were the case, then A = [B] * Kd. But in that scenario, if Kd is 508, that would mean that [B] is 508 times [A]. So [B] is much larger. But that would contradict the initial assumption because Kd is large, so the majority would be in phase B, not A.

Wait, no, that's not possible because in the problem, Kd is 508, which is a large number. So if Kd is [A]/[B], then [A] is much larger. But if Kd is [B]/[A], then [B] would be larger. So which definition is correct?

I think the confusion arises from which phase is considered first in the Kd definition. For example, sometimes Kd is defined as the concentration in the organic phase divided by aqueous. So if the solute is more soluble in organic, Kd is greater than 1.

In this problem, it's just phases A and B. So if Kd is the concentration in phase A divided by phase B, then the solute is more in A. So when Kd is large, like 508, most of the solute is in phase A, and a small fraction is in B.

So that brings me back to the initial calculation: fraction in B is 1/(508 +1) = 1/509 ≈ 0.00196, which is 1.96e-3, matching option I.

Yes, I think that's correct.

The problem involves determining the fraction of a solute in phase B at equilibrium, given a distribution constant \( K_d = 508 \) between two immiscible phases, A and B. The distribution constant is defined as:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{solute in phase A}]}{[\text{solute in phase B}]}
\]

This means the solute is significantly more concentrated in phase A than in phase B, as \( K_d > 1 \). Let the total amount of solute be normalized to 1 unit. If \( x \) represents the fraction of the solute in phase B, then the fraction in phase A is \( 1 - x \). Using the definition of \( K_d \):

\[
K_d = \frac{1 - x}{x}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
K_d \cdot x = 1 - x
\]

\[
x \cdot (K_d + 1) = 1
\]

\[
x = \frac{1}{K_d + 1}
\]

Substituting \( K_d = 508 \):

\[
x = \frac{1}{508 + 1} = \frac{1}{509} \approx 0.00196
\]

Thus, the fraction of the solute in phase B is approximately \( 1.96 \times 10^{-3} \). Comparing this result to the given options, the correct answer is:

**I: \( 1.96 \times 10^{-3} \) of the original amount of solute.**
