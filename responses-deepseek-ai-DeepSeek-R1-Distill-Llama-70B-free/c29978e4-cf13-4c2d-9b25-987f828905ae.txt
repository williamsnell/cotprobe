Question:

A professor employed by a state university is a well- known critic of foreign policy and has sometimes publicly stated that he wished for the United States to suffer some collective political tragedy in retribution for all the harms it does to the world. The professor was recently involved in a highly visible political protest against the government. The police eventually shut down the protest because they felt that it was becoming unruly. A television crew covered the entire rally. On the six o'clock news that evening, the film of the protest rally was shown during the broadcast. A news anchorman then made the following commentary: "It's a shame that public funds are spent to pay the salaries of such university professors, who are not grateful for what this country has done for them. In my opinion, these people like the professor should be deported. "If the professor asserts a claim based on invasion of privacy against the television station and the anchorman for his television commentary, the most likely result is that the professor will

Options:

A: not prevail, because the professor willingly participated in the public protest.
B: prevail, because the anchorman's comments were excessive and unnecessary.
C: not prevail, because the comments were based on the professor's public actions and statements.
D: not prevail, because the criticism was not directed at the professor personally.
E: prevail, because the comments were intrusive and violated the professor's privacy.
F: prevail, because the professor, as a private individual, was placed in a false light.
G: prevail, because the comments were defamatory and damaged the professor's reputation.
H: not prevail, because the professor's public behavior and statements made him a public figure.
I: prevail, because the comments were made with actual malice.
J: not prevail, because the broadcast was privileged as being in the public interest.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about invasion of privacy. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand.

The scenario is about a professor at a state university who's a critic of foreign policy. He's made some controversial statements wishing for the U.S. to suffer a political tragedy as retribution. He was involved in a highly visible protest that the police shut down, and it was covered by a TV crew. During the news, the anchorman commented that it's a shame public funds pay such professors who aren't grateful, and that people like the professor should be deported.

Now, the professor is claiming invasion of privacy against the TV station and the anchorman. The question is whether he will prevail.

I remember that invasion of privacy can come in different forms, like intrusion into seclusion, public disclosure of private facts, and false light privacy. But I think the key here is whether the professor is a public figure and whether the information was a matter of public interest.

Since the professor is employed by a state university, which is a public institution, and he's a well-known critic, he might be considered a public figure. Public figures have a higher bar to prove defamation or privacy violations because the First Amendment protects a lot of speech about them, especially on matters of public concern.

The protest was public, and the TV crew was there, so it's not like the professor was in a private setting. The anchorman's comments were about his public actions and statements. So, the content of the broadcast was about a public protest, which is a public event. 

In terms of invasion of privacy, for a public figure, the court would likely consider whether the information was a matter of public interest. Here, the professor's actions in the protest and his public statements are definitely of public interest. The anchorman's opinion about deporting him might be harsh, but it's an opinion based on the professor's public conduct.

I think the key issue is whether the professor can claim invasion of privacy when he's a public figure and the information was about his public actions. Invasion of privacy might not apply here because he willingly participated in a public protest, making his actions and statements fair game for public discussion.

Looking at the options, option C says the professor won't prevail because the comments were based on his public actions and statements. That makes sense because the information was public and relates to his public role. Also, option H says he won't prevail because he's a public figure, which is another valid point. 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused between options C and H. Both seem relevant. Let me think deeper. Invasion of privacy for public figures usually requires that the information be about a private matter that's not of public concern and that its disclosure would be highly offensive and not of legitimate public interest. Here, the anchorman was commenting on the professor's public actions and statements, so it's about his public conduct, not a private matter.

So the professor can't really claim that his privacy was invaded because the information was about his public life. Therefore, option C seems correct because the comments were based on his public actions and statements. Option H is about being a public figure, which affects defamation cases more than invasion of privacy. Since this is an invasion of privacy claim, the focus is more on whether the information was private or public in nature.

So the correct answer is probably C.

The professor, as a public figure due to his employment at a state university and his prominent role as a critic, faces a high bar in claiming invasion of privacy. The television commentary focused on his public actions and statements made during a protest, which are matters of public interest. Invasion of privacy typically requires the disclosure of private information that is not of public concern, which is not the case here. Since the anchorman's comments were based on the professor's public conduct, the claim is unlikely to succeed.

Answer: C
