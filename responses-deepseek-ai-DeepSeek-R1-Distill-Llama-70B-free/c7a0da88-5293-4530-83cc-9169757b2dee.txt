Okay, so I've got this question here about criminal risk assessment and public opinion on it in the US as of 2018. The question is asking what percentage of US adults think that using algorithmic decision-making for parole decisions is unreasonable. The options are A through J, with various percentages.

Hmm, I'm not exactly sure about the exact figure, but I can try to think through it. I remember that there's been a lot of debate about algorithms in criminal justice, especially regarding things like bias and fairness. Some people are concerned that these tools might not be accurate or might even perpetuate existing biases, leading to unfair outcomes.

I think the Pew Research Center did some surveys around that time. Maybe they asked about public perceptions of algorithmic decisions in parole. From what I recall, the public is somewhat skeptical about relying solely on algorithms for important decisions like parole. But I'm not sure of the exact percentage.

Wait, I think the number was somewhere in the 40s or 50s. Like maybe around 49%? Or was it higher? Alternatively, I've heard that a significant portion of the public is against it, but I don't know if it's a majority. If the question is about it being an unreasonable application, then maybe just under half the people feel that way.

So looking at the options, B is 49%, H is 41%, and I is 56%. I'm trying to remember if it was just under 50% or maybe just over. I think I've seen a figure where about half the population was skeptical, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it was a bit lower, like 41%.

Wait, another angle: I remember that a 2018 Pew study found that 56% of adults thought that using algorithms to decide parole was an unreasonable use of data. Or was that about a different application, like hiring or credit decisions? Oh right, I think the study covered multiple areas, including criminal justice. So maybe the number is higher.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. I think the study showed that a majority (like 56%) thought it was an unreasonable application in criminal risk assessment. So that would correspond to option I: 56%.

Alternatively, maybe it's lower. I think the exact number was 49%, which is option B. Or maybe it was 56%, which is option I. Wait, I'm a bit confused. I think I'll have to make an educated guess here.

I think the correct answer is B: 49%, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it was 56%, which is option I. But I'm more inclined to think it's around 49% because that's a common figure in such surveys. Or wait, maybe it's 45% or so, but that's not an option. Hmm.

Another approach: consider that some people are against it, but not a majority. So if the question is about what percentage say it's unreasonable, and the options are B (49%) and H (41%), and I (56%), I think the correct figure is 49%, making option B correct.

Wait, no, I think the actual figure was 56%. I remember reading that a little over half thought it was unreasonable. So that would be option I: 56%.

Wait, but I'm not certain. I think I should go with my initial thought that it's around 49%, making B the correct answer. Or maybe it's 56%... I'm a bit stuck here.

I think I'll go with option B: 49%. But I'm a bit unsure. Alternatively, maybe it's 56%. Wait, I think the correct answer is option I: 56%. Because I remember that a majority found it unreasonable. So I'll go with I.

The question asks about the percentage of US adults who consider criminal risk assessment for parole to be an unreasonable application of algorithmic decision-making as of 2018. After considering various possibilities and recalling studies from that time, particularly from the Pew Research Center, the reasoning leans toward the figure being around 56%, as this reflects a majority opinion. 

Answer: I
