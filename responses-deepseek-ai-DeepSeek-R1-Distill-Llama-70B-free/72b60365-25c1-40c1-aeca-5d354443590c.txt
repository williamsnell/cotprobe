Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of electrochemistry and entropy calculations. Let's take it step by step.

The question gives me a chemical reaction and an equation for the voltage (epsilon) as a function of temperature. I'm supposed to find the value of ΔS at 25°C when one mole of CdSO4·(8/3)H2O is formed. The formula to use is ΔS = nF(dε/dT), where n is 2 and F is 96484 C/mol (since 9.648456e4 is 96484.56, which I remember is the Faraday constant).

First, I need to figure out dε/dT, which is the derivative of epsilon with respect to temperature theta. The given epsilon equation is:

epsilon = 1.01845 - (4.1e-5)(theta - 20) - (9.5e-7)(theta - 20)^2

I think I should calculate the derivative of this with respect to theta. Let me write that out.

The derivative of a constant is zero, so the derivative of 1.01845 is 0.

The derivative of -(4.1e-5)(theta - 20) with respect to theta is just -4.1e-5 because the derivative of (theta -20) is 1.

Then, the derivative of the second term: -(9.5e-7)(theta -20)^2. The derivative of (theta -20)^2 is 2(theta-20), so when multiplied by the coefficient:

-9.5e-7 * 2(theta-20) = -1.9e-6(theta -20)

So putting it all together, dε/d(theta) is:

-4.1e-5 -1.9e-6(theta -20)

Wait, but wait! Oh, because theta is in Celsius, and we're taking the derivative with respect to theta, which is T in the equation. So yes, that's correct.

Now, the temperature we're evaluating at is 25°C. So theta is 25. Let's substitute theta =25 into the derivative.

First, calculate (theta-20) when theta is 25: 25-20=5.

So dε/d(theta) at 25°C is:

-4.1e-5 -1.9e-6 *5

Let me compute that:

1.9e-6 *5 = 9.5e-6.

So:

-4.1e-5 -9.5e-6 = let's convert them to the same exponent.

4.1e-5 is 41e-6. So 41e-6 +9.5e-6 = 50.5e-6. But with the negative sign, so -50.5e-6 V/°C.

Wait, because the units for dε/dT would be volts per degree Celsius, right?

So dε/dT is -50.5e-6 V/°C, which is -5.05e-5 V/°C.

Now, the formula is ΔS = n F (dε/dT). But wait, wait! I think I might have a confusion here. Because in thermodynamics, the relation is ΔG = -n F ε, and from that, the entropy ΔS is linked via the Gibbs equation: ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. But for the cell reaction, the formula is ΔS = n F (dε/dT) at constant pressure, I think. So the formula as given in the question is correct.

So n is 2, F is 96484 C/mol, and dε/dT is -5.05e-5 V/°C.

Wait, but wait, I should check the sign. Because V is J/C, so dε/dT has units of V/°C, which is (J/C)/°C.

So putting it into the equation:

ΔS = (2) * (96484 C/mol) * (-5.05e-5 V/°C)

Wait, but V is J/C, so substituting:

ΔS = 2 * 96484 C/mol * (-5.05e-5 J/(C·°C)) )

Wait, let me compute the units:

C * (J/(C·°C)) = J/(°C) → J/(°C) → since 1 J = 1 C·V, but the volts here would cancel with the C's. Hmm, perhaps better to just compute the numbers.

So compute 2 * 96484 * (-5.05e-5) = ?

Let me compute each step.

First, 2 *96484 = 192968.

Then, 192968 * (-5.05e-5) = ?

Let me compute 192968 *5.05e-5.

5.05e-5 is 0.0000505.

So 192968 *0.0000505 = ?

Let me compute 192968 * 5.05 = ?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 192968 *5.05e-5.

Alternatively, 192968 *5.05 = ?

Compute 192968 *5 = 964840.

192968 *0.05 = 9648.4.

Total: 964840 +9648.4 = 974488.4.

Now, 974488.4 multiplied by 1e-5 is 9.744884.

Since it's 5.05e-5, which is 5e-5 +0.05e-5 = 5e-5 and 0.05e-5.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 192968 *5.05e-5 as:

(192968 *5e-5) + (192968 *0.05e-5)

Which is (192968 *5 *1e-5) + (192968 *0.05 *1e-5)

192968 *5 = 964840 → 964840e-5 = 9.6484

192968 *0.05 = 9648.4 → 9648.4e-5 = 0.096484

Adding them: 9.6484 +0.096484=9.744884.

So 192968 *5.05e-5 =9.744884.

But since the original term is negative, it's -9.744884 J/°C.

So ΔS is approximately -9.744 J/(mol·K), because the temperature in Kelvin for entropy is an absolute scale, but since we're taking a derivative with temperature in Celsius, the size is the same per degree, so 1°C change is 1 K change in terms of ΔT.

So looking at the options, E is -9.74 J/K, which matches. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but wait! Let me confirm all the steps again because sometimes signs can be tricky.

The given formula is ΔS = n F (dε/dT).

We have dε/dT at 25°C as -50.5e-6 V/°C, which is -5.05e-5 V/°C.

So when multiplied by F (96484 C/mol) and n=2, the product is:

2 * 96484 * (-5.05e-5) = 2 * 96484 * (-0.0000505) = ?

Wait, let's compute 96484 * (-0.0000505) first.

96484 * 0.0000505 = ?

Compute 96484 *5.05e-5.

As before, 5.05e-5 is 0.0000505.

So 96484 *0.0000505 = let's compute:

0.00005 *96484 = 4.8242.

Because 1% is 964.84, 0.1% is 96.484, so 0.005 is 482.42, wait wait no.

Wait, 96484 * 0.00005 = 96484 *5e-5 = (96484 *5)/1e5.

96484 *5 =482420 → 482420 /1e5 =4.8242.

Now, the 0.00005 is 0.00005, and the 0.0000005 is 0.05e-5.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's compute 96484 *5.05e-5.

5.05e-5 = 5e-5 +0.05e-5.

So 96484 *5e-5 = (96484 *5)/1e5 = (482420)/1e5 =4.8242.

96484 *0.05e-5 = (96484 *0.05)/1e5 = (4824.2)/1e5 = 0.048242.

Adding these together: 4.8242 +0.048242=4.872442.

So 96484 *5.05e-5 =4.872442. But since the sign is negative, it's -4.872442.

Now multiply by 2 (because n=2):

2 * (-4.872442) =-9.744884 J/K.

Which is approximately -9.74 J/K.

Looking back at the options, option E is -9.74 J/K. So that's the answer.

To calculate the entropy change (ΔS) at 25°C for the given reaction, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta S = nF \left( \frac{d\epsilon}{dT} \right)
\]

where:
- \( n = 2 \),
- \( F = 9.648456 \times 10^4 \, \text{C/mol} \),
- \(\frac{d\epsilon}{dT}\) is the derivative of the given voltage equation with respect to temperature.

The voltage equation is:

\[
\epsilon = 1.01845 - (4.1 \times 10^{-5})(\theta - 20) - (9.5 \times 10^{-7})(\theta - 20)^2
\]

Taking the derivative with respect to \(\theta\):

\[
\frac{d\epsilon}{d\theta} = -4.1 \times 10^{-5} - 2 \cdot (9.5 \times 10^{-7})(\theta - 20)
\]

Substituting \(\theta = 25^\circ \text{C}\):

\[
\frac{d\epsilon}{d\theta} = -4.1 \times 10^{-5} - (1.9 \times 10^{-6})(5)
\]

\[
\frac{d\epsilon}{d\theta} = -4.1 \times 10^{-5} - 9.5 \times 10^{-6} = -5.05 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{V/°C}
\]

Now, calculate \(\Delta S\):

\[
\Delta S = nF \left( \frac{d\epsilon}{dT} \right)
\]

\[
\Delta S = 2 \cdot 9.648456 \times 10^4 \cdot (-5.05 \times 10^{-5})
\]

First, compute \( 2 \cdot 9.648456 \times 10^4 \):

\[
2 \cdot 9.648456 \times 10^4 = 192968 \, \text{C/mol}
\]

Then, multiply by \(-5.05 \times 10^{-5}\):

\[
192968 \cdot (-5.05 \times 10^{-5}) = -9.744884 \, \text{J/K}
\]

Thus, \(\Delta S = -9.74 \, \text{J/K}\), which corresponds to option **E**.
