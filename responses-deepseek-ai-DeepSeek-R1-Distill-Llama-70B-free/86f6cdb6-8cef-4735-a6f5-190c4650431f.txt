Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the statement of activities in government-wide financial statements. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that government-wide financial statements are different from fund financial statements. The statement of activities is one of the government-wide statements, right? The other is the statement of net position. 

I think the statement of activities presents information about governmental activities, business-type activities, and component units. Wait, but how are they presented? Oh right, they are reported in separate columns. So the statement shows each major activity in its own column.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that includes separate columns for each of these: governmental activities, business-type activities, and discretely presented component units. Hmm.

Option D says a separate column for each governmental activity and business-type activity but not for component units. That doesn't sound right because I think component units are included as separate columns too. 

Option H says separate columns for governmental, business-type, and discretely presented component units. That seems more accurate. 

Wait, what about other options? Option F has sections without component units, which I don't think is correct. Option C is just one column for all governmental, which isn't right because business-type and components are separate.

So the correct answer should be H. It includes all three in separate columns.

The statement of activities in government-wide financial statements includes separate columns for governmental activities, business-type activities, and discretely presented component units. This setup ensures each major category is distinctly presented for clarity and accountability.

Answer: H
