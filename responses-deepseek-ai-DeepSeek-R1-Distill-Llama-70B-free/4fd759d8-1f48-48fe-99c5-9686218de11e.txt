Okay, so I've got this math problem here: −25 − (−11). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive. So, when I see −25 minus −11, it should become −25 plus 11. Wait, is that right?

Let me visualize it on the number line. Starting at -25, and then adding 11. So if I move 11 units to the right from -25, where do I end up? Let's count: from -25 to 0 is 25 units, but I'm only adding 11, so I won't reach zero. So, -25 plus 11 is -14. Oh wait, that's what I get when I subtract a negative. So the result should be -14.

Looking at the options, let me see. Option B is −14. So that's probably the correct answer. But wait, let me double-check. Maybe I should write it down step by step.

The expression is −25 − (−11). The double negative means the second term becomes positive. So it's −25 + 11. Now, subtracting 25 and 11: 25 minus 11 is 14, but since 25 is bigger and negative, the result is −14. Yep, that makes sense. So the answer should be B: −14.

The expression −25 − (−11) simplifies to −25 + 11. Subtracting these values gives −14.

B
