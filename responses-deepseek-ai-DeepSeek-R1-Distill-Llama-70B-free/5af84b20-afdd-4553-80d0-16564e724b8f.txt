Question:

A researcher grows a population of ferns in her laboratory. She notices, after a few generations, a new variant that has a distinct phenotype. When she tries to breed the original phenotype with the new one, no offspring are produced. When she breeds the new variants, however, offspring that look like the new variant result. Which of the following could possibly characterize the new variant?

Options:

A: Divergent selection
B: Genetic drift
C: Coevolution
D: Convergent evolution
E: Directional selection
F: Adaptive radiation
G: Sympatric speciation
H: Allopatric speciation
I: Polyploidy
J: Equilibrium

Okay, let's try to figure out this question. So, the scenario is about a researcher studying ferns. She notices a new variant with a distinct phenotype after a few generations. When she tries to breed the original with the new variant, there's no offspring. But when she breeds the new variants together, they produce offspring that look like the new variant.

Hmm, so the key points here are: new variant appears, can't interbreed with the original, and can breed among themselves. So, this sounds like speciation because they can't interbreed anymore, which is a key indicator of a new species.

The options given include things like selection types, genetic drift, coevolution, etc. But I'm thinking about what could cause this situation. 

Wait, the researcher is growing them in the lab, so it's a controlled environment. So, allopatric speciation happens when populations are geographically isolated, leading to different species. But here, they're in the same lab, so maybe not allopatric. Then there's sympatric speciation, which happens in the same geographic area without physical separation. That could be possible, like through polyploidy.

Oh, and polyploidy is when an organism has more than two sets of chromosomes. If the new variant is polyploid, like tetraploid, and the original is diploid, they can't interbreed because their chromosomes don't match up. But when the polyploid plants breed among themselves, they produce viable offspring. So that fits the scenario.

So looking at the options, I and G. Option I is polyploidy, which directly explains the situation. Option G, sympatric speciation, is the process, but the question asks which could characterize the variant. So maybe both could be correct, but the question is about the variant's characteristic.

Wait, the question is asking what could characterize the new variant. So the variant could be polyploid. So the answer would be I.

Alternatively, the process could be sympatric speciation (G), but the question is about the variant's characteristic, so I think I is the answer.

The scenario involves a researcher observing a new variant of ferns that cannot interbreed with the original phenotype but can produce viable offspring among themselves. This indicates speciation, and the key to understanding the new variant lies in its characteristic.

The new variant likely arose due to **polyploidy**, a condition where an organism has more than two sets of chromosomes. If the original ferns are diploid and the new variant is tetraploid, they cannot interbreed successfully because their chromosome numbers differ, preventing viable offspring. However, when the polyploid variants breed among themselves, they produce viable offspring with the same polyploid characteristic. This aligns with the description provided.

While sympatric speciation (G) describes the process of speciation occurring in the same geographic area without physical isolation, the question specifically asks about the characteristic of the new variant. Therefore, the correct answer is **polyploidy**.

Answer: I
