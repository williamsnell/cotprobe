Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

Roya paid $48 for 12 cartons of orange juice. The question is asking for the unit rate per carton. Unit rate usually means the price per one item, right? So in this case, I need to find out how much one carton costs.

Alright, so the total cost is $48, and she bought 12 cartons. To find the price per carton, I should divide the total cost by the number of cartons. That makes sense because if you split the total amount equally among each carton, you get the price for one.

Let me write that down: $48 divided by 12 cartons. Hmm, 48 divided by 12. I think I remember that 12 times 4 is 48 because 12 times 3 is 36, and adding another 12 makes 48. So 48 divided by 12 is 4. That would mean each carton costs $4.

Wait, let me double-check that. If each carton is $4, then 12 cartons would be 4 times 12, which is indeed 48. Yeah, that adds up correctly. So I don't think I made a mistake there.

Looking at the options, option I is $4. So that should be the correct answer.

The unit rate is calculated by dividing the total cost by the number of cartons: $48 รท 12 = $4.
