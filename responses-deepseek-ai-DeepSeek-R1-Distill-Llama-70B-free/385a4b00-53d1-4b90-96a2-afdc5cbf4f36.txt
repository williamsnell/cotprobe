Okay, so I've got this question about federal civil procedure, specifically dealing with interrogatories and protective orders. Hmm. Let me think through this.

The scenario is that the plaintiff's attorney served the defendant with a summons, complaint, and 25 interrogatories. The interrogatories ask about the defendant's contentions and state they must be answered within 30 days. The question is about why the defendant would likely get a protective order. The options are A through J.

First, I remember that under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 26 and Rule 33 are key here. Rule 33 deals with interrogatories. Let me recall the basics.

Rule 33(b) says that a party may serve interrogatories on any other party. The number is limited without a court order or agreement. Oh wait, the default is 25 interrogatories, including subparts, unless the court allows more. So if they served exactly 25, that's okay unless the option is about exceeding. But wait, some options mention the number.

Looking at the options, option D says the interrogatories exceed the number permitted without permission. If they served 25, that's within the limit, so D wouldn't apply. Unless I'm misremembering. Wait, is it 25 total or 25 per category? No, I think the limit is 25 in total, including subparts, so 25 is allowed.

Option C says interrogatories may not be served until an answer is filed. I think that's not correct because parties can serve interrogatories after the complaint is served but before an answer is filed. So the timing here might not be an issue. So C might not be the reason.

Option I says they can't be served until after the initial conference to arrange for disclosures. Rule 26(f) requires a discovery plan meeting before certain discovery, but I think interrogatories can be served before that meeting as long as they're not due until after. Or maybe the meeting must happen first. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I think under Rule 26(d), discovery can't be served until after the meeting unless the court orders otherwise or the parties agree. Oh wait, no, maybe that's not accurate. Or perhaps it's that the meeting should happen first. Wait, no, Rule 26(d) says that parties may not serve discovery before the meeting except for the initial disclosure, which is different. Hmm, so if interrogatories are served before the Rule 26(f) conference, that could be a problem. But in this case, the summons and complaint were served, so the defendant would have to respond, but the timing of the interrogatories might be premature if the conference hasn't happened yet. So perhaps option I is a valid ground for a protective order.

Option E says the defendant isn't required to respond within 30 days. Rule 33(b)(2) says that a party must answer within 30 days after service, so E is incorrect because the defendant is required to respond within that time unless extended.

Option A says the interrogatories weren't accompanied by a summons and complaint. But in this case, they were, so A is incorrect.

Option B says the defendant isn't required to respond during a federal action. No, that's wrong because parties do have to respond to interrogatories.

Option F says the interrogatories are excessively burdensome. If so, that's a valid ground under Rule 26(c), but the question states that the interrogatories are about the defendant's contentions, which I think is a proper subject. Unless they're unduly burdensome, but the question doesn't indicate that, so F might not be the best option here.

Option H says the questions are irrelevant. Again, about the defendant's contentions, which are relevant because they can lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. So H might not apply unless the questions are truly irrelevant, which I don't think is the case here.

Option J says interrogatories are only for facts, not contentions. Wait, I think that's incorrect. I remember that parties can ask about contentions. For example, in Rule 33(c), the answers can be used to prove the contentions, but I think the rule allows for asking about contentions. Or wait, no. Let me think again. Rule 33(a) says that any party may serve on any other party no more than 25 interrogatories, and each interrogatory must be answered. So the contentions can be asked about. Or perhaps not? Another angle: maybe parties can't be compelled to state their legal contentions through interrogatories. I'm a bit confused here. Wait, I think that under Rule 33, you can ask about facts, but not legal contentions. Because legal theories are protected, but facts that support contentions can be inquired about. So if the interrogatories ask about the defendant's contentions, perhaps that's improper, making option J a possible correct answer.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: can a party be compelled to disclose their legal theories or contentions via interrogatories? I think that's protected. So if the interrogatories are about the defendant's contentions, that might be improper. So the defendant could seek a protective order on that basis, making J a correct option.

Alternatively, I thought about option I, which is about serving before the discovery plan meeting. If the interrogatories were served before the parties met under Rule 26(f), that's a violation. Because under Rule 26(d), no discovery requests can be served until after the Rule 26(f) conference, unless the court orders otherwise. So if the plaintiff served the interrogatories before that meeting, the defendant could get a protective order on that ground.

So which is more likely correct: option I or option J?

The question says the plaintiff served the summons, complaint, and 25 interrogatories. I don't know when the Rule 26(f) conference was. If the conference hasn't happened yet, then serving interrogatories would be premature, so option I would apply.

But in many cases, the complaint is filed, and then the summons is issued. The defendant then has to answer, but before that, the parties might not have had their Rule 26(f) meeting. So if the plaintiff served the interrogatories along with the summons and complaint, that would be too early, right? Because the Rule 26(f) meeting is supposed to happen after the complaint is served but before any discovery is conducted.

Wait, no. Let me check. Rule 26(d) says that parties may not serve discovery requests (including interrogatories) before the Rule 26(f) conference, except as allowed by the rule. So if they served interrogatories without waiting for the conference, that's a violation, and the defendant could move for a protective order on that basis. So option I would be correct.

Alternatively, if the conference hasn't happened yet, then the plaintiff is jumping the gun. So in that case, option I would be the reason for the protective order.

But let me think about the other options. Option J says that interrogatories are only for facts, not contentions. So if the questions are about the defendant's contentions, perhaps that's improper. But I'm a bit unsure about that. I think that parties can ask about the facts that form the basis of the contentions, but perhaps not the legal contentions themselves. So I'm not certain whether J is correct.

In the scenario, the interrogatories ask about the defendant's contentions. So if that's allowed, then J isn't the reason, but if it's not allowed, J would be.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is I, because the timing is off. So the defendant can move for a protective order because the interrogatories were served too early, before the discovery plan meeting.

So, putting it all together, the possible correct options are I and J.

Wait, another point: under Rule 26(a), initial disclosures are required without a request, but that's separate from discovery requests.

So, the key here is whether the interrogatories were served before the Rule 26(f) conference. If so, that's a violation of Rule 26(d), and the court must grant a protective order. So option I would be the correct answer.

But I'm a bit confused because sometimes parties serve interrogatories along with the complaint, but I think that's not allowed unless they've had the conference.

So, the defendant would likely succeed on the ground that the interrogatories were served before the required conference, making option I correct.

The question revolves around whether the defendant can obtain a protective order based on the plaintiff serving 25 interrogatories along with the summons and complaint in a federal district court action. The analysis focuses on the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, particularly Rule 26 and Rule 33, which govern discovery and interrogatories.

### Key Analysis of Options:

1. **Option A**: Incorrect. The interrogatories were accompanied by a summons and complaint, so this is not a valid ground for a protective order.

2. **Option B**: Incorrect. The defendant is required to respond to interrogatories during a federal district court action, as mandated by Rule 33.

3. **Option C**: Incorrect. Interrogatories can be served after the complaint is filed but before the defendant files an answer, so timing is not an issue here.

4. **Option D**: Incorrect. Rule 33 allows up to 25 interrogatories without court permission, and the plaintiff served exactly 25, so this is not a valid ground.

5. **Option E**: Incorrect. Under Rule 33(b)(2), the defendant is required to respond within 30 days, so this is not a valid ground.

6. **Option F**: Unlikely. While excessively burdensome interrogatories can justify a protective order under Rule 26(c), the question does not indicate that the interrogatories are unduly burdensome.

7. **Option G**: Incorrect. The interrogatories were properly served to the defendant.

8. **Option H**: Unlikely. Questions about the defendant's contentions are relevant to the case, as they may lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.

9. **Option I**: Correct. Under Rule 26(d), discovery requests, including interrogatories, cannot be served before the Rule 26(f) conference where the parties meet to arrange for initial disclosures and prepare a discovery plan. If the interrogatories were served before this conference, this would be a valid ground for a protective order.

10. **Option J**: Unlikely. While legal contentions are generally protected, Rule 33 allows parties to inquire about the factual basis of contentions. Thus, asking about the defendant's contentions is not necessarily improper.

### Conclusion:
The most likely ground for the defendant to succeed in obtaining a protective order is that the interrogatories were served before the required Rule 26(f) conference, violating Rule 26(d). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**I**
