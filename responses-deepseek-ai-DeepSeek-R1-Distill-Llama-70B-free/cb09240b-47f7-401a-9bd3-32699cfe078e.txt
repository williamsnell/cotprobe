Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Nathanson's form of retributivism. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that retributivism is a theory of punishment that focuses on punishing offenders because they deserve it for their wrongdoing. It's about giving them their "just deserts." So, Nathanson's version must fit within that framework.

The question is asking which of the options A through D is not required by Nathanson's retributivism. So, I need to figure out which one doesn't fit.

Looking at the options:

A: A list of crimes ranked according to their seriousness. That makes sense because retributivism often involves proportionalityâ€”punishment fitting the crime. So a ranking would help determine appropriate punishments.

B: A scale of punishments corresponding to the seriousness of crimes. Again, this aligns with proportionality. If crimes are ranked, the punishments should scale accordingly.

C: Treating criminals humanely. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Retributivism can sometimes be harsh, but I think some versions, like Nathanson's, might still require humane treatment. Maybe because it's about justice but not necessarily cruelty.

D: The death penalty for the most serious crimes. Hmm. Retributivism can support capital punishment, especially for severe crimes. But I'm not sure if Nathanson specifically advocates for it.

Wait, I think I remember that Nathanson's retributivism is a bit more moderate. He might not support the death penalty. Or perhaps he allows for it, but the question is about what's not required. Alternatively, maybe his form doesn't necessarily include the death penalty as a must-have.

Another approach: The question asks which is not required. So, the other three are required, and one is not.

If Nathanson's theory requires a ranking of crimes (A), a corresponding scale of punishments (B), and humane treatment (C), then the exception would be D, the death penalty.

Wait, but does retributivism necessarily require the death penalty? I think some retributivists support it, others might not. If Nathanson's version doesn't require it, then D would be the exception.

Alternatively, maybe the death penalty is optional, so it's not required. Thus, the answer would be D because Nathanson's retributivism doesn't require the death penalty.

So, putting it all together, the exception is D: the death penalty for the most serious crimes.

Nathanson's form of retributivism emphasizes proportionality and humane treatment but does not necessarily require the death penalty. 

The correct answer is D.

D
