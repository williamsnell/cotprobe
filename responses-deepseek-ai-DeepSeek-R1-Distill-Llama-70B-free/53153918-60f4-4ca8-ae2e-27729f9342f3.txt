Okay, so I've got this problem here about a store wanting to make a certain profit, and I need to find the markup percentage on the selling price. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

Alright, the problem says the store aims for a $12,000 profit on sales of $200,000. So, the first thing I think about is the basic profit equation: Profit = Sales - Expenses. But wait, there are other factors here like markdowns, shortages, alterations, and cash discounts. I need to consider all these to find the correct markup.

Let me list out all the given numbers to make it clearer. The desired profit is $12,000. Sales are $200,000. The expenses are $56,000. Then there are markdowns of $15,000, shortages of $5,000, alteration costs of $2,500, and cash discounts earned from vendors of $4,500. I think I need to adjust the expenses with these other numbers because they affect the overall profitability.

Wait, so how exactly do these other items factor in? Markdowns are reductions in the selling price, right? So that would reduce the sales. But wait, in the profit equation, maybe they're considered as expenses or reductions in revenue. Similarly, shortages would be losses, so they might be expenses. Alteration costs are definitely expenses. Cash discounts earned are like income, so they would reduce expenses.

Let me think about the formula. Profit is calculated as Sales minus (Cost of Goods Sold plus Operating Expenses). But here, I'm given some additional items. So perhaps I should calculate the total expenses including all these factors.

Wait, the problem gives me expenses as $56,000. But then there are other deductions or additions. Let me see: Markdowns would probably be subtracted from sales because they reduce the selling price. Or wait, maybe they're treated as an expense. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me clarify each term.

Markdowns are the amount by which the selling price is reduced. So they would decrease the sales revenue. So maybe I should subtract markdowns from the sales to get the net sales. But wait, the problem states the sales as $200,000. Does that include markdowns, or is that before markdowns? Hmm, I'm not sure. Wait, I think in accounting, sales are recorded at the selling price, and markdowns are treated as reductions, so maybe the $200,000 is the sales after markdowns. Or perhaps not. This is a bit tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to calculate the total amount available for markup. Let me think: The store's desired profit is 12,000. So the total amount they have to work with (after covering all expenses and other deductions) should be such that when they add the markup, they get the desired profit.

Wait, maybe the formula to calculate the markup percentage based on selling price is:

Markup % = (Profit / (Sales - Total Expenses)) * 100

But wait, I'm mixing up things. Let me try another approach. Let's consider all the costs that the store incurs and subtract them from the sales to find out the profit, then determine the markup needed.

So, the total expenses would include the given $56,000, plus markdowns, shortages, and alteration costs. But wait, are markdowns and shortages expenses? Or are they adjustments to sales?

Wait, markdowns are a reduction in sales, so they would affect the revenue side. Shortages are losses, so they would be an expense. Alteration costs are definitely an expense. Cash discounts earned are a reduction in expenses because they're like income.

So, maybe the formula should be:

Net Sales = Sales - Markdowns
Total Expenses = Expenses + Shortages + Alteration Costs - Cash Discounts

So, let me compute that.

Net Sales = $200,000 - $15,000 = $185,000.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the sales are $200,000. Does that include markdowns, or is that before markdowns? I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps markdowns are part of the cost structure. Hmm, maybe I should think of the desired profit in relation to the cost.

Wait, another approach: The store's target profit is $12,000. To achieve this, the markup must cover all expenses and the desired profit. So the total amount to be covered by markup is the sum of all expenses, including markdowns, shortages, alterations, minus any income like cash discounts.

Wait, so let's calculate the total cost. The expenses are $56,000. But then we add the other costs: markdowns are $15,000, shortages $5,000, alterations $2,500. Then subtract the cash discounts earned, which is $4,500, because that's a saving.

So, total cost = 56,000 + 15,000 +5,000 +2,500 - 4,500.

Let me compute that:

56,000 +15,000 =71,000

71,000 +5,000=76,000

76,000 +2,500=78,500

78,500 -4,500=74,000.

So total cost is $74,000.

The store wants a profit of $12,000. So the total selling price (which is the sales) is $200,000. But wait, earlier I thought that the net sales would be 200,000 - markdowns, but I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to consider that the desired profit is $12,000, and the total costs amount to $74,000. So the required markup is such that when added to the cost, gives the selling price. But wait, the selling price is the sales, which is $200,000.

Wait, so the markup is the amount added to the cost to get the selling price. So:

Markup = Selling Price - Cost

But the selling price is $200,000, and the cost is $74,000, so the markup would be 200,000 -74,000= $126,000.

Wait, but the question asks for the markup percent on the selling price. So the formula is:

Markup % = (Markup / Selling Price) * 100.

So that would be (126,000 / 200,000) *100 = 63%. But that's not one of the options. Hmm, that must mean I'm doing something wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the cost. Let me go back. The problem states that the desired profit is $12,000. So perhaps the markup is calculated based on the cost, and the selling price includes the markup plus the cost. But wait, maybe I'm mixing up cost of goods sold with total expenses.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be:

Profit = Sales - (Expenses + Markdowns + Shortages + Alterations) + Cash Discounts

So, Profit = 200,000 - (56,000 +15,000 +5,000 +2,500) +4,500.

Let me compute that.

56,000 +15,000=71,000

71,000 +5,000=76,000

76,000 +2,500=78,500

So, 200,000 -78,500=121,500. Then add 4,500 (cash discounts), so 121,500 +4,500=126,000. So profit would be 126,000. But the desired profit is 12,000. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps the $56,000 expenses are operating expenses, and the other items are additional costs. So the total cost would be 56,000 (expenses) plus 15,000 (markdowns) plus 5,000 (shortages) plus 2,500 (alterations) minus 4,500 (cash discounts).

So total cost =56,000 +15,000 +5,000 +2,500 -4,500 = let's compute that.

56k +15k=71k. 71k+5k=76k. 76k+2.5k=78.5k. 78.5k -4.5k=74k. So total cost is $74,000.

Desired profit is $12,000. So selling price (which is given as $200,000) must be equal to cost plus desired profit plus markup? Wait, I'm getting confused again.

Wait, perhaps the approach is that the selling price is the sum of cost, expenses, and desired profit. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the markup is calculated on the cost, not the selling price. But the question asks for markup percent on the selling price.

Wait, maybe the formula is:

Markup = Desired Profit + Total Expenses

But I'm not certain. Let me think again. The markup is the amount added to the cost to get the selling price. So Markup = Selling Price - Cost.

But the selling price is $200,000, and the cost is $74,000, so markup is $126,000. Then, markup percent on selling price is (126,000 / 200,000) *100 = 63%, which isn't an option. So I must have messed up the cost calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the $56,000 expenses are the cost of goods sold, and the other items are additional expenses. So maybe the total cost is 56,000 plus the sum of markdowns, shortages, alteration costs, minus cash discounts.

Wait, maybe the initial expenses are operating expenses, and the cost of goods sold is separate. But the problem doesn't specify, which complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps I should model the problem differently.

Perhaps the correct way is to compute the total amount that needs to be marked up. The desired profit is $12,000. The total deductions from sales are markdowns, etc. So perhaps the formula is:

Markup = Desired Profit + (Expenses + Markdowns + Shortages + Alterations) - Cash Discounts

So:

Markup =12,000 +56,000 +15,000 +5,000 +2,500 -4,500

Let me calculate that step by step.

12k +56k=68k

68k +15k=83k

83k +5k=88k

88k +2.5k=90.5k

90.5k -4.5k=86k.

So markup is $86,000.

Then, since markup is based on selling price, the percentage is (86,000 /200,000)*100 =43%. Hmm, but 43% isn't an option either. Wait, the options given are A:33.33%, B:39.09%, C:25%, D:37.5%, E:42.5%, F:40%, G:35%, H:28%, I:45%, J:30%.

Hmm, 43% isn't an option, so I must have made a mistake in this approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the markup is calculated on the cost, not the selling price. Because sometimes markup can be on cost or on selling price. The question specifically asks for markup percent on the selling price, so the formula would be (Markup / Selling Price)*100.

Wait, let me try a different approach. The total amount needed to cover all costs and desired profit is:

Total required = Cost + Desired Profit.

But what is the cost here? The cost would be the sum of all expenses, including markdowns, shortages, alterations, minus cash discounts.

So, cost = 56,000 (expenses) +15,000 (markdowns) +5,000 (shortages) +2,500 (alterations) -4,500 (cash discounts) = as before, 74,000.

So, total required =74,000 +12,000=86,000.

Wait, but the selling price is 200,000. So the markup is 200,000 - (cost of goods sold?).

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe I should think of the markup as the amount added to the cost to get the selling price. So, Markup = Selling Price - Cost.

But in this case, selling price is 200,000, and cost is 74,000. So Markup is 126,000.

Markup percentage on selling price is (126,000 / 200,000) *100 =63%, which isn't an option. So I'm definitely doing something wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the cost is not 74,000. Maybe the $56,000 expenses are the operating expenses, and the cost of goods sold is something else, perhaps the markdowns and shortages are part of COGS.

Wait, perhaps the initial data is structured differently. Let me think again.

The problem states:

- Desired profit: $12,000

- Sales: $200,000

- Expenses: $56,000

- Markdowns: $15,000

- Shortages: $5,000

- Alteration costs: $2,500

- Cash discounts earned: $4,500

I think I should calculate the total cost as:

Total Cost = Expenses + Markdowns + Shortages + Alteration Costs - Cash Discounts

So, 56,000 +15,000=71,000 +5,000=76,000 +2,500=78,500 -4,500=74,000.

So, total cost is $74,000.

Now, the selling price is $200,000, which includes the markup. The markup would be Selling Price minus Cost.

So, Markup =200,000 -74,000= $126,000.

Markup percentage on selling price is (126,000 /200,000)*100=63%.

But again, that's not an option. So I must have a wrong approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the markup is applied to the cost, and the selling price is cost plus markup. But the question asks for markup on selling price, so perhaps I should compute it differently.

Alternatively, maybe the expenses include the cost of goods sold, and the other items are additional expenses. So total expenses would be 56,000 +15,000 +5,000 +2,500 -4,500=74,000 as before.

So, to get the desired profit of 12,000, the total sales must cover the total expenses and the desired profit. So, Sales = Total Expenses + Desired Profit.

Wait, but the sales are given as 200,000. So, 200,000 =74,000 +12,000 + Markup?

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the markup is the difference between sales and the sum of all costs except profit.

Wait, maybe the formula is:

Markup = Sales - (Total Expenses + Markdowns + Shortages + Alterations) + Cash Discounts

So, Markup =200,000 - (56,000 +15,000 +5,000 +2,500) +4,500.

Compute that:

56k+15k=71k +5k=76k +2.5k=78.5k.

So, 200,000 -78,500 =121,500. Then add 4,500: 126,000.

So Markup is $126,000.

Then Markup percent on selling price is 126,000 /200,000 *100=63%. Again, same result.

But that's not an option. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. The markup is based on the cost, not the selling price. But the question asks for markup on the selling price.

Wait, let me think: Markup can be based on cost or on selling price. If it's based on cost, then Markup = Cost * Markup Percentage. But if it's based on selling price, then Selling Price = Cost + (Markup Percentage * Selling Price).

Wait, maybe I should express the markup as a percentage of the selling price. So, Selling Price = Cost + Desired Profit.

Wait, but wait, Cost includes all expenses, etc. So:

Selling Price = Cost + Desired Profit

But that would make Selling Price =74,000 +12,000=86,000, which is less than the given $200,000. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the selling price is the amount that includes the markup. So, if the markup is calculated on the selling price, then:

Markup = (Markup Percentage) * Selling Price

And Selling Price = Cost + Markup

So, Selling Price = Cost + (Markup Percentage * Selling Price)

Which rearranges to Selling Price - (Markup Percentage * Selling Price) = Cost

Selling Price (1 - Markup Percentage) = Cost

So, Markup Percentage = (Cost / Selling Price) * (Desired Profit / (Selling Price - Cost)) ?

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me try to approach it with the correct formula.

The formula for markup percentage based on selling price is:

Markup Percentage = (Profit / Selling Price) * 100

But wait, Profit is Selling Price - Cost. So,

Markup Percentage = (Selling Price - Cost) / Selling Price *100

In this case, Selling Price is $200,000, and Cost is $74,000.

So,

Markup Percentage = (200,000 -74,000)/200,000 *100 = 126,000 /200,000 *100=63%

Which again, isn't an option. So perhaps I'm miscalculating the cost.

Wait, perhaps the $56,000 expenses do not include the cost of goods sold. Maybe I'm confusing operating expenses with COGS. Oh wait, perhaps the problem is using a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the store's total cost includes COGS plus operating expenses, and then other adjustments.

Wait, maybe I should structure it as:

Total Cost = COGS + Operating Expenses + Markdowns + Shortages + Alterations - Cash Discounts.

But the problem doesn't mention COGS separately. It just gives $56,000 as expenses. So perhaps the $56,000 includes COGS and other operating expenses.

In that case, COGS might be included in the $56,000, and the other items are adjustments.

Alternatively, perhaps the $56,000 is just operating expenses, and COGS is calculated separately. But without knowing, I have to make assumptions.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the markup calculated as follows:

The store's desired profit is $12,000. The total deductions from sales are markdowns, etc. So the formula to find the required markup is:

Markup = Desired Profit + (Expenses + Markdowns + Shortages + Alterations) - Cash Discounts.

So that's 12,000 +56,000 +15,000 +5,000 +2,500 -4,500= let's compute:

12k +56k=68k

68k+15k=83k

83k+5k=88k

88k+2.5k=90.5k

90.5k-4.5k=86k.

So markup is $86,000.

Then, since the selling price is $200,000, the markup percentage is (86,000 /
