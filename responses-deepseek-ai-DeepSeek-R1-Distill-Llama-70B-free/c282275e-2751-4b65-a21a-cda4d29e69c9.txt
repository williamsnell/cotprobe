Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about functional analysis and variables. I'm a bit rusty on my psychology terms, but I'll try to work through this step by step.

First, the question is asking: "A functional analysis is conducted in order to identify _______ variables." The options are A through J, each with a different term.

I remember that functional analysis is a concept from psychology, specifically related to behavior analysis. It's used to understand the causes of behavior, right? So, in behavioral terms, functional analysis helps determine why a behavior is happening. That usually involves looking at the variables that affect the behavior.

Wait, variables in experiments are typically categorized into independent, dependent, and extraneous (or confounding) variables. The independent variable is the one the researcher manipulates to see the effect on the dependent variable, which is the outcome measured.

But functional analysis is more about identifying the functions that maintain a behavior. So, it's looking for the variables that influence the behavior. In behavioral psychology, this often relates to operant conditioning, where behavior is a function of its consequences.

So, when a functional analysis is conducted, they're trying to find out which variables are influencing the behavior. These variables could be antecedents (what happens before the behavior) or consequences (what happens after). The goal is to see which of these variables are causing the behavior to occur or be maintained.

Looking at the options:

A: organismic - I think organismic variables refer to characteristics of the individual, like traits or biology. Not sure if that's what functional analysis focuses on.

B: controlling - Hmm, controlling variables are those that are kept constant in an experiment. Not sure if that's the right fit here.

C: dependent - Dependent variables are outcomes measured. But the question is about identifying variables that affect behavior, so maybe not.

D: moderator - Moderator variables affect the relationship between two variables, but I'm not sure if that's the primary focus here.

E: intervening - Intervening variables are hypothetical constructs that explain the relationship between variables. Like latent variables. But functional analysis is more about observable factors.

F: confounding - Confounding variables are extraneous variables that can affect the results. Again, not the main focus of functional analysis.

G: correlational - Correlational variables are those that show relationships but not causation. Functional analysis is about causation, so probably not.

H: extraneous - These are variables that could interfere but aren't the focus. I don't think this is right.

I: independent - Independent variables are the ones manipulated to see effect on dependent variable. In functional analysis, the researcher might manipulate certain variables to see their effect on behavior, so this could be it.

J: manipulated - This is similar to independent variables because in experiments, you manipulate the independent variable.

Wait, but functional analysis might involve manipulating variables to see their effect. So the question is about identifying which variables are important. So during the analysis, they might test different variables to see which ones influence the behavior. So the variables being identified are the ones that are manipulated to observe changes.

Alternatively, functional analysis often uses single-subject designs where the independent variable is manipulated across phases (like ABAB designs). So the variables being identified are the ones that serve as the independent variables because they're the ones causing changes in behavior.

So the correct term here would be either "independent" or "manipulated." Looking at the options, I think "manipulated" is an adjective, but the term is "independent variables." Wait, the question asks to identify which variables, so the answer is likely "manipulated" because in functional analysis, you manipulate variables to see their effect.

Wait, but another angle: functional analysis is about identifying the function of a behavior. So it's about understanding which variables (like attention, escape, etc.) are maintaining the behavior. These variables are the independent variables because they're the ones affecting the dependent variable (the behavior).

So the question is, which term fills in the blank? The options are "manipulated" (J) or "independent" (I). Since the variables are being manipulated to see their effect, the term is "manipulated variables."

Wait, but another thought: in experiments, the independent variable is the manipulated one. So the variables being identified in a functional analysis are the independent variables because they're the ones the researcher is testing as potential causes.

So the answer would be either I or J. Let me think: "manipulated" is more of a description of what's being done to the variable. The question is asking what kind of variables are being identified. So the variables are the independent ones because they are the ones being tested as causes.

So the correct answer is I: independent.

Wait, but another angle: in functional analysis, sometimes the variables are not manipulated but observed. Wait no, in a functional analysis, the researcher does manipulate variables to see their effect. For example, they might test whether a behavior occurs when a demand is present (to test for escape as a function) versus when attention is provided.

So the variables being identified are the ones that are being manipulated, which are the independent variables. So the answer is I: independent.

Alternatively, the variables are the ones that are manipulated, so J: manipulated variables. But the term used in research is "independent variables," so I think the answer is I.

A functional analysis is conducted to identify the variables that influence behavior, particularly in the context of operant conditioning. This process involves understanding the causes of behavior by examining the variables that affect it. These variables are typically manipulated to observe their impact on the behavior being studied. In research, such variables are referred to as "independent variables" because they are the factors the researcher manipulates to observe their effect on the dependent variable (the behavior). While "manipulated" describes the action taken on these variables, the term "independent variables" is the specific term used to describe them in this context. Therefore, the correct answer is:

I: independent

Answer: I
