Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about calculating the work done by a perfect gas during an adiabatic, frictionless process when its temperature changes from 200°F to 300°F. The molecular weight is given as 34.0, and the specific heat at constant pressure Cp is given by the expression 0.212 + 0.000059*T. The options are multiple choice from A to J.

Hmm. Alright, I remember that in thermodynamics, when a process is adiabatic, there's no heat exchange with the surroundings (Q=0). So the first law of thermodynamics, which is ΔU = Q + W, simplifies to ΔU = W, since Q is zero. Wait, but wait—sometimes the sign convention can be tricky. I think in this context, work done by the system is considered positive, so if the system does work on the surroundings, W is positive. But I'll have to be careful about that.

Wait, but wait another thing—this is an adiabatic process, which means no heat is transferred. So for an adiabatic process, the work done is equal to the change in internal energy. So I'll need to find the change in internal energy.

But wait, the gas is perfect, so I can use the relation for internal energy. For a perfect gas, the internal energy depends only on temperature. So the change in internal energy ΔU is n*Cv*ΔT, where Cv is the molar specific heat at constant volume.

But wait, the problem gives me the specific heat at constant pressure, Cp, not Cv. So I'll need to find Cv from Cp. I remember that for a perfect gas, Cp = Cv + R, where R is the gas constant. But wait, what units are we working in here? Because the given Cp is in Btu/lb·°F? Or wait, the units here might be a bit tricky.

Wait, the question gives specific heat at constant pressure as Cp = 0.212 + 0.000059*T. I think the units are Btu per pound per degree Fahrenheit because the options are in Btu/lb. So I need to make sure that when I calculate ΔU, I'm using the correct units.

Wait, but wait—ΔU would be per mole or per unit mass? Because the given data is in lb units, maybe I should work in mass units.

Let me think. The process is for a gas with molecular weight Mw =34.0. So perhaps I can compute the specific heat per unit mass, then multiply by the temperature change.

Wait, but the question is about work done, which is ΔU, but expressed in Btu per pound. Because the options are in Btu/lb.

So, the approach would be: calculate the change in internal energy per unit mass (Δu), then since work done is ΔU, which is m*Δu, but since the question gives options per lb, perhaps it's per unit mass.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's outline the steps.

1. Recognize that for an adiabatic process, W = ΔU (since Q=0 and ΔU = W).

2. For a perfect gas, ΔU depends only on temperature change. ΔU = n*Cv*ΔT.

But since I don't have Cv, I can get it from Cp. Cp = Cv + R, so Cv = Cp - R.

Wait, but R here is the gas constant in the same units as Cp. So I need to make sure that Cp and R are compatible in units.

Wait, but Cp is given as a function of temperature: Cp = 0.212 + 0.000059*T, where T is in °F, I suppose. But when dealing with Cv, we have to express it in terms of Cp and R. So perhaps I should calculate Cv as a function of temperature as well.

Wait, but in reality, for a perfect gas, Cv is a function only of temperature, but if the gas is ideal, sometimes we can assume that the specific heats are constant, but in this problem, Cp is given as a function of T, so perhaps we need to integrate over the temperature change.

Alternatively, perhaps for a perfect gas, the specific heat at constant volume Cv can be calculated from Cp and the gas constant R using the relation Cp = Cv + R. Wait, but R here is per mole or per mass?

Wait, the gas constant R is usually given per mole. So, for molar calculations, R is about 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lb-mol·°R), but perhaps I can convert that into Btu units. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to work with specific heats on a mass basis.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to clarify the units.

The specific heat Cp is given in Btu/lb·°F. So, for a mass m, the heat at constant pressure would be m*Cp*dT.

But since we're dealing with an adiabatic process, we're looking at ΔU, which is m*cv*ΔT.

Wait, but wait—cv is the specific heat at constant volume per unit mass, in Btu/(lb·°F).

So, the first step is to find cv from Cp and the relation Cp = cv + R_specific, where R_specific is the gas constant per unit mass.

Wait, R (gas constant) is usually given as R = 10.7316 ft·lbf/(lb-mol·°R) for R in imperial units. Alternatively, in terms of Btu, since 1 Btu ≈ 778 ft·lbf, so R ≈ 10.7316 / 778 ≈ 0.01396 Btu/(lb-mol·°R).

Wait, but wait, since we have specific heats in Btu/lb·°F, perhaps we should express R in Btu/(lb·°F), considering the molecular weight.

Wait, the specific gas constant R_specific is R (molar) divided by molecular weight Mw.

So R_specific = R / Mw.

So let me compute R in Btu units. Let me see:

1 Btu = 778.169 ft·lb-f

So, R = 10.7316 ft·lb-f/(lb-mol·°R).

Convert R to Btu units:

R = 10.7316 ft·lb-f/(lb-mol·°R) * (1 Btu / 778.169 ft·lb-f) ) ≈ 0.0138 Btu/(lb-mol·°R).

So for a molecular weight Mw of 34 lb/lb-mol, the specific gas constant R_specific is R / Mw = 0.0138 / 34 ≈ 0.000406 Btu/(lb·°R).

Wait, since in this problem, the temperature is given in Fahrenheit, but the conversion between °F and °R is that ΔT in °F equals ΔT in °R (since a change of 1°F is a change of 1°R). So, the R_specific in Btu/(lb·°F) is 0.000406 Btu/(lb·°F).

So, now, Cp is given as 0.212 + 0.000059*T, in Btu/(lb·°F). So, we can write that Cv = Cp - R_specific.

Wait, because Cp = Cv + R_specific, so Cv = Cp - R_specific.

Therefore, Cv = (0.212 + 0.000059*T) - 0.000406.

Wait, but wait—let me compute that. 0.212 minus 0.000406 is 0.211594, and then subtract 0.000059*T, but wait wait—that can't be right. Wait no, no: R_specific is 0.000406, so Cv = (0.212 + 0.000059*T) - 0.000406.

So that would be 0.211594 + 0.000059*T.

Wait, but that seems correct.

So, the specific heat at constant volume as a function of temperature is Cv(T) = 0.211594 + 0.000059*T, in Btu/(lb·°F).

But wait, no. Let me re-express that. Since R_specific is 0.000406, then Cv(T) = Cp(T) - R_specific.

So, Cp(T) = 0.212 + 0.000059*T.

Thus, Cv(T) = 0.212 + 0.000059*T - 0.000406 = (0.212 - 0.000406) + 0.000059*T.

Which is 0.211594 + 0.000059*T.

So, Cv(T) = 0.211594 + 0.000059*T.

Now, the change in internal energy per unit mass is the integral of Cv(T) dT from T_initial to T_final.

Since Cv is a function of T, we can write Δu = ∫ Cv(T) dT from T_initial to T_final.

So, let's compute the integral.

Cv(T) = a + b*T, where a = 0.211594, b = 0.000059.

The integral from T1 to T2 is a*(T2 - T1) + (b/2)*(T2² - T1²).

So, let's calculate that.

Wait, but the temperatures are given in Fahrenheit. But since we're dealing with a change in temperature, and the specific heats are expressed per degree Fahrenheit, we can treat T as a variable in °F.

Wait, but wait a second. In thermodynamic calculations, the integral of Cv dT would be from T_initial to T_final, regardless of the temperature scale, as long as the specific heat is expressed in terms of that scale. So, in this case, since Cv is in Btu/(lb·°F), and the temperature change is in °F, the units should work out.

So, the temperatures are given as 200°F and 300°F. So, ΔT = 100°F.

Wait, but wait, the initial temperature is 200°F, final is 300°F. So, the system's temperature is increasing, so the internal energy increases, so the work done by the system would be positive? Or wait, in an adiabatic process, when the temperature increases, the work done by the system is negative because the system is doing work on the surroundings, so the internal energy increases at the expense of work done by the system.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The first law is ΔU = Q + W, where W is work done on the system. But in some conventions, work done by the system is negative. So in this case, when the system does work, W is negative, and ΔU would be positive if Q is zero, so work done by the system is negative.

Wait, this might be getting me confused. Let's clarify.

In the first law, ΔU = Q - W, where W is work done by the system. So, in that case, if the system does work, W is positive, and ΔU would be Q - W. Since in an adiabatic process, Q=0, so ΔU = -W. Hence, W = -ΔU.

So, if ΔU is positive, W is negative, meaning the system has done work on the surroundings, so the work done by the gas is negative.

Alternatively, another convention is ΔU = Q + W, where W is work done on the system. In that case, if the system does work, W is negative. So, in adiabatic process, ΔU = W (work done on the system). So, if the system does work, W is negative, so ΔU is negative. But in this problem, the temperature increases, so ΔU is positive, so W would be positive in this convention, meaning work done on the system.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me try to approach this more carefully.

In the first law of thermodynamics, the change in internal energy ΔU equals the heat added to the system plus the work done on the system: ΔU = Q + W.

In an adiabatic process, Q=0, so ΔU = W. So, if work is done on the system (compression), W is positive, and ΔU increases. If work is done by the system (expansion), W is negative, so ΔU decreases.

But in this problem, the temperature increases from 200°F to 300°F. So, the internal energy increases. Therefore, ΔU is positive. So, W is positive, meaning work is done on the system. So, in this case, the work done by the gas would be negative.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's the work done by the gas. So, if W is positive when work is done on the gas, then when the gas does work on the surroundings, W would be negative.

Wait, I think I should proceed with the calculation, and the sign will come out naturally. Let's focus on the magnitude first and then determine the sign based on the process.

So, back to the calculation: we have to compute Δu, the change in internal energy per unit mass, which is the integral of Cv(T) dT from T_initial to T_final.

Given that, Cv(T) = 0.211594 + 0.000059*T.

So, let me compute the definite integral from T1 = 200°F to T2 = 300°F.

The integral of Cv(T) dT is:

∫a^b (a + b*T) dT = a*(b - a) + (b/2)*(b² - a²).

Wait, no, more accurately, the integral from T1 to T2 of (a + b*T) dT is:

a*(T2 - T1) + (b/2)*(T2² - T1²).

So, let's compute each term.

a = 0.211594 Btu/(lb·°F).

b = 0.000059 Btu/(lb·°F²).

Wait, no, because in Cv(T), the term is 0.000059*T, so the units would be Btu/(lb·°F) * °F, so Btu/(lb). Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, because T is in °F, so when you have 0.000059 [per °F], multiplied by T in °F, the units would be 0.000059 * °F^2? No, that can't be. No, wait, no. Wait, the specific heat is in Btu/(lb·°F), and T is in °F, so when you multiply, the units become Btu/(lb). So, the integral over dT in °F would give units of Btu/lb.

Wait, perhaps that's correct. So, the integral:

Δu = ∫_{200}^{300} [0.211594 + 0.000059*T] dT.

So, let's compute each term.

First, compute the a*(T2 - T1) term:

a = 0.211594.

ΔT = 100°F.

So, 0.211594 * 100 = 21.1594 Btu/lb.

Second term: (b/2)*(T2² - T1²).

b = 0.000059.

Compute T2² = 300^2 = 90,000.

T1² = 200^2 = 40,000.

T2² - T1² = 90,000 - 40,000 = 50,000.

So, (b/2)*50,000 = (0.000059 / 2) * 50,000.

Let me compute this:

0.000059 / 2 = 0.0000295.

Multiply by 50,000: 0.0000295 * 50,000 = 1.475.

So, the second term is 1.475 Btu/lb.

So, the total Δu = 21.1594 + 1.475 = 22.6344 Btu/lb.

Wait, but wait a minute. That seems quite high, and the answer options are not in that range. The highest option is F:12.34, and the others are lower. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me check the computations again.

First, a = 0.211594, correct.

ΔT = 100, so 0.211594 * 100 = 21.1594. That's correct.

Second term: (0.000059 / 2) * (300^2 - 200^2).

300^2 = 90,000, 200^2=40,000. Difference is 50,000.

So, 0.000059 * 50,000 / 2.

Wait, 0.000059 * 50,000 = 2.95. Then divided by 2, gives 1.475. So that's correct.

So, total Δu is 21.1594 + 1.475 = 22.6344 Btu/lb.

Hmm, but that's not matching any of the options. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of R_specific. Let me recalculate R in Btu units.

R (molar) is 10.7316 ft·lbf/(lb-mol·°R). To convert this to Btu, since 1 Btu = 778.169 ft·lbf, so:

R = 10.7316 / 778.169 ≈ 0.0138 Btu/(lb-mol·°R).

Then, R_specific = R / Mw.

Mw is 34.0 lb/lb-mol.

So, R_specific = 0.0138 / 34 ≈ 0.000406 Btu/(lb·°R).

Since ΔT is in °F, which is the same as °R in terms of change, so R_specific is 0.000406 Btu/(lb·°F).

So, that part seems correct.

Wait, but then Cv(T) = Cp(T) - R_specific.

So, Cp(T) is 0.212 + 0.000059*T.

Cv(T) = 0.212 + 0.000059*T - 0.000406.

Which gives Cv(T) = 0.211594 + 0.000059*T.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when calculating Cv. Let me recheck.

Yes, because Cp = Cv + R, so Cv = Cp - R. So that's correct.

Wait, but maybe the specific heat was given per mole instead of per mass. Did I make a wrong assumption about the units?

Wait, the problem says "specific heat
