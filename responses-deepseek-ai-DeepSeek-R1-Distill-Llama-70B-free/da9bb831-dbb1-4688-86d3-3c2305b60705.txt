Okay, so I have this question about rock guitarists and neckties. I'm trying to figure out which one designed a line of colorful men's neckties. Hmm, let me think. 

I remember that some rock stars have side projects beyond music. I know that John Mayer, for instance, has done some collaborations, but I'm not sure about neckties specifically. Then there's Jerry Garcia from the Grateful Dead. Oh wait, I think he had a line of ties. His style was pretty colorful and unique, which would make sense for neckties. 

Let me go through the options. Option F is Jerry Garcia. I'm pretty confident that's the right choice. I've heard that he had a tie collection because he liked to express himself through fashion too. So the answer should be F.
