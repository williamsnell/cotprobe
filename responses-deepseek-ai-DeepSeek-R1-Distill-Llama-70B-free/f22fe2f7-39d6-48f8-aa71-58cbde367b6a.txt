Okay, so I've got this question here about the main nitrogenous compound in urine. Hmm, I remember from biology class that our body excretes waste products, and urine is a major way to get rid of nitrogenous wastes. Let me think about what those compounds are.

Wait, urea rings a bell. I think urea is produced in the liver as part of the urea cycle, right? That process converts ammonia, which is toxic, into urea, which is less harmful. The kidneys then excrete urea through urine. So urea must be a major component.

Looking at the options, option H is urea. But wait, what about the other choices? Let me go through them one by one to make sure I'm not mixing things up.

Option A: Uric acid. I remember uric acid is related to purines, like from DNA breakdown. It's also excreted in urine, but isn't it more associated with the digestive system? Wait, isn't uric acid the stuff that can cause gout when it builds up? But I don't think it's the main one in urine.

Option B: Nitrous oxide. That's a gas, like laughing gas. I don't think that's a major component of urine. Probably not.

Option C: Nitric acid. That's a strong acid, more of an industrial chemical. I don't recall the body producing that as a waste product.

Option D: Nitrites. Those are compounds containing nitrite ions. Not sure about these being in urine. Maybe as part of some metabolic process, but I don't think they're the main.

Option E: Nitrogen. Well, nitrogen is a element, but in its elemental form, it's a gas. Urine doesn't have elemental nitrogen as a main compound. It's compounds that contain nitrogen, like urea.

Option F: Urethane. That sounds like something synthetic, maybe a chemical used in industry. Not a natural body product.

Option G: Amino acids. While amino acids are nitrogen-containing, the body usually reabsorbs them in the kidneys unless there's a problem like kidney damage. So in normal urine, amino acids aren't the main component.

Option I: Creatinine. Oh, right, creatinine is another waste product found in urine. It's produced from muscle metabolism. But is it the main one? I think urea is in higher concentration.

Option J: Ammonia. The body does produce ammonia, especially during amino acid metabolism, but it's quickly converted to urea. So ammonia isn't the main in urine because it's toxic, and the body doesn't excrete it in large amounts.

So putting it all together, urea is the primary nitrogenous waste in urine. That means the correct answer is H: Urea.

The main nitrogenous compound in urine is urea. Urea is produced in the liver through the urea cycle, where ammonia is converted into a less toxic form. It is then excreted by the kidneys. While other nitrogen-containing compounds like uric acid, creatinine, and ammonia are present, urea is the most abundant. 

Answer: H
