Okay, so I've got this question here about adolescent males and homosexual experiences. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure about the exact percentage, but I remember reading somewhere that it's a smaller number than I might think. Let me think.

I think the question is asking about how common it is for teenage boys to have homosexual experiences. I remember that while a lot of people might experiment during adolescence, the actual percentage who identify as homosexual is lower. Wait, no, the question is specifically about experiences, not identity.

I recall that Kinsey's studies were some of the earliest to look into sexual behavior. I think Kinsey reported that a significant portion of males had some same-sex experiences, but that was more about sexual behavior rather than identity. But wait, the question is about adolescents, so maybe it's a bit different.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing this with another study. I think more recent studies suggest that around 5-10% of adolescents report same-sex attractions or experiences. So looking at the options, option G is 10 and option C is 5. Which one is it?

I remember that in some surveys, like the Youth Risk Behavior Survey in the US, the percentage of high school students who report having had sexual contact with someone of the same sex is around 5-8%. So maybe 5% is closer. But wait, the question is about experiences, which could include more than just contactâ€”like kissing or other things.

Alternatively, I've heard that about 10% of people have some same-sex experiences during their lives, but that includes all ages. For adolescents specifically, maybe it's lower because they're still exploring.

Wait, but I'm also thinking about the idea that during teenage years, there's a lot of experimentation. So maybe the percentage is a bit higher. I'm a bit confused now.

Another angle: the options given are A:30, B:90, C:5, D:50, E:80, F:70, G:10, H:20, I:40, J:60. So 5% or 10% are the lower options. I'm trying to recall if any authoritative source says it's around 5-10%. 

I think I've heard that about 7-10% of males have some same-sex experience during adolescence. So maybe 10% is the answer, which would be option G. Alternatively, some sources might say it's lower, around 5%, which would be option C.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is referring to the percentage of males who have at least some homosexual experiences, not necessarily identifying as gay. I think in some studies, it's found that around 20% of males report some same-sex attraction or experience, but that includes more than just adolescents. Oh, but the question is specifically about teenagers.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about other contexts. For example, in some cultures, there's more acceptance, but in others, less. But the question is general.

Alternatively, I remember a study indicating that about 10% of adolescent males report same-sex attractions or experiences, so that would point me towards option G:10.

The question asks about the percentage of adolescent males who have homosexual experiences during their teenage years. To answer this, I considered various studies and surveys, such as Kinsey's work and the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, which suggest that a smaller percentage of adolescents report same-sex experiences. While some sources indicate around 5-10%, others mention slightly higher numbers. Given the options provided (A:30, B:90, C:5, D:50, E:80, F:70, G:10, H:20, I:40, J:60), and focusing on the specificity of adolescent experiences, 10% seems to align with the most commonly cited estimates.
