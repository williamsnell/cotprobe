Okay, so I have this problem here about Mr. Golden and his real estate taxes. Hmm, let's see. I remember that real estate taxes are usually calculated based on the assessed value of the property, not the market value. Oh wait, right, the assessed value is a percentage of the market value. 

The problem says the market value is $16,500. The city assesses the property at 40% of the actual value. So I guess I need to calculate 40% of $16,500 first. Let me do that. 40% is the same as 0.4, so 16,500 multiplied by 0.4. Let me compute that. 16,500 times 0.4... 16,500 times 0.4 is 6,600. So the assessed valuation is $6,600.

Now, the tax rate is given as 21.3 mills per dollar. Wait, what's a mill? Oh right, I think a mill is one-thousandth of a dollar. So 1 mill is $0.001 per dollar of assessed value. So 21.3 mills would be 21.3 * 0.001 = $0.0213 per dollar.

So the tax is the assessed value multiplied by the tax rate. So $6,600 multiplied by 0.0213. Let me calculate that. 6,600 * 0.0213. Hmm, let me break it down. 6,000 * 0.0213 is 128. (Wait 6,000 * 0.02 is 120, and 6,000 * 0.0013 is 7.8, so 120+7.8=127.8). Then 600 * 0.0213 is ... 600 * 0.02 is 12, and 600 * 0.0013 is 0.78. So 12.78. So total is 127.8 +12.78 = 140.58. 

So the tax should be $140.58. Let me look at the options. Option H is $140.58. So the answer should be H.

To determine Mr. Golden's real estate taxes, we first calculate the assessed value of the property. The market value is $16,500, and the assessed valuation is 40% of this amount:

\[
\text{Assessed Value} = 16,500 \times 0.4 = 6,600
\]

Next, the tax rate is 21.3 mills per dollar. Since 1 mill equals $0.001, the tax rate in dollars is:

\[
\text{Tax Rate} = 21.3 \times 0.001 = 0.0213
\]

The real estate tax is then calculated by multiplying the assessed value by the tax rate:

\[
\text{Tax} = 6,600 \times 0.0213 = 140.58
\]

Thus, Mr. Golden pays $140.58 in real estate taxes. The correct answer is:

H: $140.58

Answer: H
