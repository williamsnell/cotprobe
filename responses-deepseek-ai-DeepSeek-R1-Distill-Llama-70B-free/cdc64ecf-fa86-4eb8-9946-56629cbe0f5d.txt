Okay, so I have this accounting problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem gives me the current assets and current liabilities of a company, and I need to compute three things: the current ratio, the quick asset ratio, and the net working capital. Then, I have to choose the correct option from A to J that matches my calculations.

First, I'll list out the data given. The current assets are broken down into cash, marketable securities, accounts receivable, and inventories. The current liabilities are accounts payable, notes payable, and other bills payable. 

Let me jot down the numbers to make it clearer.

Current Assets:
- Cash: $22,150
- Marketable Securities: $16,000
- Accounts Receivable: $30,450
- Inventories: $25,000
Total Current Assets: $93,600 (Wait, let me add these up to confirm. 22,150 +16,000 is 38,150. Then 38,150 +30,450 is 68,600. Plus 25,000 makes 93,600. Okay, that adds up.)

Current Liabilities:
- Accounts Payable: $28,500
- Notes Payable: $20,000
- Other Bills Payable: $10,000
Total Current Liabilities: $58,500 (Let me check: 28,500 +20,000 is 48,500, plus 10,000 makes 58,500. That's correct.)

Now, let's compute each part one by one.

**a) Current Ratio:**
The current ratio is calculated as Current Assets divided by Current Liabilities. So that's 93,600 / 58,500. Let me compute that. 93,600 ÷ 58,500. Hmm, let's see, both numbers can be divided by 100 first, so 936 / 585. Let me do this division. 

585 goes into 936 once (585), subtracting gives 351. Bring down a zero: 3510. 585 goes into 3510 six times (585*6=3510). So the current ratio is 1.6. Because 585 * 1.6 = 936. Let me double-check that: 585 * 1.6 = 585 * 1 + 585 *0.6 = 585 + 351 = 936. Yep, correct. So current ratio is 1.6.

**b) Quick Asset Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio):**
This is (Current Assets - Inventories) divided by Current Liabilities. So first, subtract the inventories from current assets. Current assets are 93,600, minus 25,000 in inventories gives 68,600.

Then divide by current liabilities of 58,500. So 68,600 /58,500. Let me compute that. 58,500 goes into 68,600 once (58,500), subtract to get 10,100. Bring a decimal and a zero: 101,000. 58,500 goes into 101,000 once (58,500), remainder 42,500. Bring another zero: 425,000. 58,500 *7 is 409,500. Subtracting gives 15,500. So approximately 1.173... So about 1.17 or 1.18 when rounded. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it as 68,600 ÷ 58,500 = 1.173. So approximately 1.17. 

Wait, let me check that again. Let me compute 68,600 divided by 58,500.

Alternatively, I can write both as thousands: 68.6 /58.5 ≈ 1.173, so 1.17 when rounded to two decimal places. So the quick ratio is approximately 1.17.

**c) Net Working Capital (NWC):**
This is Current Assets minus Current Liabilities. So 93,600 -58,500 = 35,100. So NWC is $35,100.

Now, let me look at the options provided. Each option gives values for current ratio, quick ratio, and NWC. Let me go through them:

Option A: CR 2.0, Q 1.5, NWC 45,000. Well, our CR is 1.6, so A is out.

Option B: CR 1.6, Q 1.05, NWC 35,100. Our quick ratio is about 1.17, so 1.05 is too low. Not B.

Option C: CR 1.5, which is less than our 1.6. So C is wrong.

Option D: CR 1.8, which is higher than our 1.6. So no.

Option E: CR 1.7, which is higher than ours. So no.

Option F: CR 1.7, nope.

Option G: CR 1.5, no.

Option H: CR 1.3, nope.

Option I: CR 1.6, Quick ratio 1.17, NWC 35,100. That matches exactly with our calculations.

Option J: CR 1.6, Q 1.2, NWC 35,000. Our Q is 1.17, which is closer to 1.17 than 1.2, and NWC is 35,100, so J's NWC is 35k, which is close but not exact.

Wait, looking back at option I: It says current ratio 1.6, quick ratio 1.17, NWC 35,100. That exactly matches what I calculated.

Wait, let me check the options again. Oh, option I says NWC is 35,100. Yes, that's correct.

So the correct option must be option I.

To solve the problem, we need to compute three financial metrics: the current ratio, the quick asset ratio, and the net working capital (NWC), using the provided data on current assets and current liabilities.

### Data Provided:
**Current Assets:**
- Cash: $22,150
- Marketable Securities: $16,000
- Accounts Receivable: $30,450
- Inventories: $25,000  
**Total Current Assets:** $93,600  

**Current Liabilities:**
- Accounts Payable: $28,500
- Notes Payable: $20,000
- Other Bills Payable: $10,000  
**Total Current Liabilities:** $58,500  

---

### Calculations:

1. **Current Ratio:**  
   The current ratio is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Current Assets}}{\text{Total Current Liabilities}} = \frac{93,600}{58,500} = 1.6
   \]

2. **Quick Asset Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio):**  
   The quick asset ratio is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Quick Asset Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Current Assets} - \text{Inventories}}{\text{Total Current Liabilities}} = \frac{93,600 - 25,000}{58,500} = \frac{68,600}{58,500} \approx 1.17
   \]

3. **Net Working Capital (NWC):**  
   The NWC is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{NWC} = \text{Total Current Assets} - \text{Total Current Liabilities} = 93,600 - 58,500 = 35,100
   \]

### Matching with Options:
- **Option A:** Current ratio = 2.0 (incorrect), Quick ratio = 1.5 (incorrect), NWC = $45,000 (incorrect).  
- **Option B:** Current ratio = 1.6 (correct), Quick ratio = 1.05 (incorrect), NWC = $35,100 (correct).  
- **Option C:** Current ratio = 1.5 (incorrect), Quick ratio = 1.3 (incorrect), NWC = $33,100 (incorrect).  
- **Option D:** Current ratio = 1.8 (incorrect), Quick ratio = 1.4 (incorrect), NWC = $38,000 (incorrect).  
- **Option E:** Current ratio = 1.7 (incorrect), Quick ratio = 1.1 (incorrect), NWC = $40,100 (incorrect).  
- **Option F:** Current ratio = 1.7 (incorrect), Quick ratio = 1.25 (incorrect), NWC = $39,100 (incorrect).  
- **Option G:** Current ratio = 1.5 (incorrect), Quick ratio = 1.2 (incorrect), NWC = $30,100 (incorrect).  
- **Option H:** Current ratio = 1.3 (incorrect), Quick ratio = 0.9 (incorrect), NWC = $25,000 (incorrect).  
- **Option I:** Current ratio = 1.6 (correct), Quick ratio = 1.17 (correct), NWC = $35,100 (correct).  
- **Option J:** Current ratio = 1.6 (correct), Quick ratio = 1.2 (incorrect), NWC = $35,000 (close but incorrect).  

The only option that matches all three calculations is **Option I**.

**Answer:** I
