Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A man told his neighbor, "If you will mow my lawn, I will pay you $50. " The neighbor then purchased gasoline for the mower so he could mow the lawn. The neighbor wheeled his lawn mower to the man's property and started the engine. At that moment, the man suddenly yelled, "I hereby revoke my offer. "If the neighbor thereafter mows the man's lawn, will he recover the $50?

Options:

A: Yes, because there was an offer for a unilateral contract that became irrevocable prior to the man's attempted revocation.
B: No, because the neighbor had done nothing more than prepare to accept the offer prior to the man's revocation.
C: Yes, because the neighbor can sue for breach of oral contract.
D: Yes, because the neighbor had begun the task before the man revoked his offer.
E: Yes, under the doctrine of quasi-contract.
F: No, because there was no written contract and hence no legal obligation for the man to pay.
G: No, because the neighbor did not get a written agreement from the man.
H: No, because the man's revocation was effective, since the neighbor had not completed performance.
I: No, because the man revoked his offer before the task was completed.
J: Yes, because the neighbor had already incurred expenses in preparation to fulfill the contract.

Okay, so I have this question about contract law, specifically regarding offers and revocation. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is that a man offers his neighbor $50 to mow his lawn. The neighbor agrees to do it, so there's an offer and acceptance. Now, the neighbor goes ahead and buys gasoline for his mower to prepare. He then takes the mower to the man's property and starts the engine. At that exact moment, the man yells that he's revoking the offer. The question is whether the neighbor can still recover the $50 if he goes ahead and mows the lawn after the revocation.

I remember that contracts can be either unilateral or bilateral. A unilateral contract is one where the offer requires performance, not just a promise to perform. In this case, the man's offer is "if you mow my lawn, I'll pay you $50." That sounds like a unilateral contract because the neighbor has to perform the action (mowing) to accept the offer.

Now, under contract law, the general rule is that offers are revocable unless certain exceptions apply. For unilateral contracts, the offer becomes irrevocable once the offeree (the neighbor) starts performance. This is because the offeror (the man) has induced the offeree to start the task, and revoking it after that would be unfair.

So in this case, the neighbor started the engine on the mower, which means he began performance. Therefore, the man's revocation at that moment wouldn't be effective because the offer had already become irrevocable upon the start of performance.

Looking at the answer options:

Option A says yes because the offer became irrevocable before revocation. That fits with what I was thinking. The man can't revoke after the neighbor started mowing.

Option B says no because the neighbor only prepared. But he actually started mowing, so B might not be correct.

Option D says yes because he began the task. That also fits, but I think A is more precise about the irrevocable part.

Option J mentions incurring expenses, but the key point is starting performance, not just preparation.

So the correct answer should be A because the offer became irrevocable once performance began.

The correct answer is A. Under the principles of unilateral contracts, an offer becomes irrevocable once the offeree begins performance. Here, the neighbor started the mower, indicating the commencement of performance, making the offer irrevocable.

Answer: A
