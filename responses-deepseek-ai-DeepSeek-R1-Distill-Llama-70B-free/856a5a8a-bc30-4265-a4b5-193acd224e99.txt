Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating the interest charge on a loan and finding the total amount due. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

The problem says: A $600 loan at 6% for 60 days. I need to find the interest charge and then the total amount due. The options are A to J, each with different amounts.

Hmm, I remember that interest calculations can vary based on whether it's simple interest or compound interest. But I think for loans like this, especially short-term, simple interest is usually used. So I'll go with simple interest here.

The formula for simple interest is I = P * R * T. Where I is the interest, P is principal amount, R is the rate of interest per period, and T is the time the money is borrowed for.

Wait, but wait. The rate given is 6%, but that's probably an annual rate, right? Because typically, interest rates are annual unless stated otherwise. So I need to adjust the time period accordingly. 

The time here is 60 days. I think I should convert that into years since the rate is annual. So 60 days divided by 365 days in a year. Let me calculate that: 60/365 is approximately 0.1644 years. But wait, sometimes for such calculations, especially in some contexts, people might use 360 days as the year for simplification. But I'm not sure if that's the case here. Let me think. If it's a bank, they might use 360 days. But for simplicity, maybe the question expects 365 days. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the rate is already a simple rate for any period, but I think it's more likely that the 6% is annual.

So let's proceed with 60/365. So R is 6% per annum, which is 0.06 in decimal. T is 60/365.

Putting it all together: I = 600 * 0.06 * (60/365).

Let me compute that step by step. First, 600 multiplied by 0.06 is 36. Then 36 multiplied by (60/365). Let's compute 60/365 first. 60 divided by 365 is approximately 0.16438356. So 36 * 0.16438356 is about 36 * 0.16438. Let me calculate that: 36 * 0.16 is 5.76, and 36 * 0.00438 is approximately 0.15768. Adding them together, 5.76 + 0.15768 is around 5.91768. So approximately $5.92.

Wait, that's the interest. So the total amount due would be the principal plus interest, which is 600 + 5.92 = 605.92. But looking at the options, I don't see exactly that. Let me double-check my calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the time calculation. Oh wait, perhaps the interest is calculated using 60 days as a fraction of 360 days. Let me try that. So 60/360 is 1/6, which is approximately 0.1666667 years.

So I = 600 * 0.06 * (1/6). Let's compute that. 0.06 divided by 6 is 0.01. So 600 * 0.01 is 6. So the interest is $6, making the total 606. Ah, that's option E: $606.

Wait, that seems straightforward. So why did I get a different number before? Oh because I used 365 days instead of 360. So perhaps the question is using 360 days in a year for calculation. That's a common practice in some financial calculations, especially in banking for simple interest.

So with that, the interest is $6. So total amount is 600 + 6 = 606, which is option E.

Alternatively, perhaps the rate is 6% per annum, but sometimes, the rate could be applied differently, like monthly, but that's not indicated here. The question doesn't specify, so I think the standard approach is to use 6% annual rate, converting 60 days into a fraction of a year. So using 60/365, the interest would be about $5.92, making the total $605.92, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps the correct approach is to use 60/360.

Wait, let's recalculate with 60/360. So 60/360 = 1/6. So 6% * 1/6 is 1%. So 1% of 600 is 6. So yes, that gives $6 interest, total $606.

Looking at the options, E is $606. So that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the 6% is a monthly rate? But that would make the interest much higher. For example, 6% monthly would be 72% annually, which is very high. So that's probably not the case. So I think it's an annual rate, and using 60 days as a fraction of 360 days is correct here. So the answer should be E.

To calculate the interest charge on a $600 loan at 6% for 60 days and determine the total amount due, we use the simple interest formula:

\[
I = P \cdot R \cdot T
\]

Where:
- \( P = \$600 \) (principal amount),
- \( R = 6\% = 0.06 \) (annual interest rate),
- \( T = \frac{60}{360} = \frac{1}{6} \) (time in years, assuming a 360-day year for simplicity).

Substituting the values:

\[
I = 600 \cdot 0.06 \cdot \frac{1}{6}
\]

First, calculate \( 0.06 \cdot \frac{1}{6} = 0.01 \). Then:

\[
I = 600 \cdot 0.01 = \$6
\]

The total amount due is the sum of the principal and the interest:

\[
\text{Total Amount} = \$600 + \$6 = \$606
\]

Thus, the total amount due is **\$606**, which corresponds to option **E**.
