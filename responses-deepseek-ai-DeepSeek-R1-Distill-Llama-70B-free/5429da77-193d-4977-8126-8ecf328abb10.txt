Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem here. Let me read it again.

The question is about dropping a ball versus throwing it downward. When you drop a ball from rest, it accelerates downward at 9.8 m/s². But if you throw it downward, what happens to its acceleration immediately after leaving your hand? The options are from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that when you drop an object, it's in free fall, meaning the only force acting on it is gravity. So the acceleration is due to gravity, which is 9.8 m/s². But what if you throw it downward?

Wait, when you throw it downward, you're giving it an initial velocity. But acceleration is different from velocity. Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. So if the ball is thrown downward, does that affect its acceleration?

I think about forces. In free fall, the net force is just gravity. When you throw it, you apply a force, but once it's left your hand, the only force acting on it is gravity again. So the acceleration should still be 9.8 m/s² downward, right?

But wait, could the initial push affect the acceleration? Like, when you throw it, you might give it a push, but once it's released, the only acceleration is from gravity. So immediately after leaving your hand, the acceleration would still be 9.8 m/s².

So looking at the options. Option J says 9.8 m/s². That seems right. But let me check other options.

Option A says more than 9.8. Why would it be more? Oh, maybe if there was air resistance, but the question says no air resistance. So that's not it.

Option B says less than 9.8. I don't think so because the acceleration is still just from gravity.

Option C says greater if thrown with a force. Hmm, maybe they're confusing force with acceleration. Force would affect the initial velocity, but not the acceleration after release. So no, C doesn't seem right.

Option D is 19.6, which is double. That would be if acceleration was 2g, but why? Maybe if you pushed it with some force, but no, once it's released, it's just g.

Option E says can't say unless speed is given. But acceleration is independent of velocity. So whether you throw it fast or slow, the acceleration is the same. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Dependent on angle. No, because you're throwing it directly downward, angle wouldn't affect the acceleration. If you threw it at an angle, maybe, but the question says throw downward, so angle probably isn't a factor here.

G: Not accelerated, maintains speed. No, that's wrong because without acceleration, it wouldn't be in free fall. The acceleration is what makes the speed increase.

H: Zero, as in free fall. Wait, no, free fall has acceleration of g. So H is incorrect.

I: Equal to the speed of throw. That doesn't make sense because acceleration is in m/s², speed is m/s. Units don't match.

So that leaves me with J as the correct answer. The acceleration is still 9.8 m/s² because it's in free fall, regardless of the initial velocity you gave it.
</think>

When you drop a ball from rest, it accelerates downward at 9.8 m/s² due to gravity. If you throw the ball downward, you give it an initial velocity, but once it leaves your hand, the only force acting on it is gravity. Therefore, the acceleration immediately after release is still 9.8 m/s². Acceleration depends on the net force acting on the object, not on the initial velocity. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, D, F, G, H, I**: These are incorrect because they either confuse acceleration with velocity, misinterpret the role of force, or incorrectly assume variations in acceleration due to factors like angle or air resistance, which are not relevant here.
- **C**: Incorrect because the acceleration after release is independent of the force used to throw the ball.
- **E**: Incorrect because acceleration is determined by gravity, not the initial velocity.
- **J**: Correct because the acceleration remains 9.8 m/s², as the ball is in free fall after being thrown.

The correct answer is:

J: 9.8 m/s²

Answer: J
