Okay, so I've got this question here about afterimages and color perception. Hmm, I remember that afterimages are those things you see after staring at something for a while and then looking away. Like when you look at a bright light and then see a spot when you close your eyes.

The question says Curtis is staring at a yellow star for a full minute. Then he looks at a white paper, and the question is about the color of the afterimage he'll see. The options are from A to J, with various colors.

Wait, I think afterimages have something to do with how the eyes get tired of looking at a color. So the eye's photoreceptors, like the cones, get fatigued. Each color has its own cones, right? So if you stare at yellow, which is a specific wavelength, those cones get tired.

I remember that the afterimage color is the complementary color of the original. Complementary colors are the ones opposite each other on the color wheel. Like red and green are complements, blue and orange, and yellow and... wait, what's opposite yellow? I think it's purple or maybe blue. Wait, no. Let me think again.

The color wheel has primary colors red, blue, yellow. The secondary colors are made by mixing two primaries: green (blue+yellow), orange (red+yellow), and purple (red+blue). So the complementary of yellow should be a mix that isn't yellow. Wait, no, each primary's complement is the secondary color made from the other two primaries. So yellow's complement would be blue? Or is it purple?

Wait, maybe I should think about it differently. When you look at a color, the cones that detect that color get tired. So when you look at a white background, those tired cones don't respond as much. White is all colors together, so the areas that were active (say, for yellow) are now less active, and the complementary color would be what's perceived. So the afterimage should be the opposite of yellow.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Another way: if you stare at red, the afterimage is green. Because red and green are complementary. Similarly, blue's afterimage would be yellow, I think. So for yellow, the afterimage would be blue or maybe purple? Or is it blue's complement?

Wait, wait, I think I mixed up. Let's clarify: the complementary color pairs are:

- Red and Cyan (which is a green-blue)
- Blue and Yellow
Wait, no, that's in terms of light. But in terms of pigments, it's different. Maybe I'm getting confused between additive and subtractive color mixing.

Wait, in additive (light), the primary colors are red, green, blue. Their complements would be cyan, magenta, and yellow, respectively. Because when you have red, the complement is cyan (green+blue). But in subtractive (pigments), the primary colors are cyan, magenta, and yellow. Hmm, maybe this is complicating things.

Wait, perhaps an easier approach. Let's think about what afterimage colors I've experienced. For example, if you look at a red rose for a while, the afterimage is green. Because red and green are complementary in terms of the cones. Similarly, if you look at a blue image, the afterimage is yellow. So what about yellow?

If the original is yellow, the afterimage should be blue. Because blue is the complement of yellow in terms of the eye's color perception. So when you look at yellow, the cones for blue (maybe?) get less stimulated, or wait, the cones for red and green make yellow. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the cones in the retina are sensitive to red, green, and blue wavelengths. When you look at yellow, which is a combination of red and green light, those cones (red and green) get fatigued. So when you look at white, which has all colors, the red and green cones are less responsive. So the brain perceives the oppositeâ€”more blue. Because white minus yellow (red+green) would leave blue. So the afterimage would be blue.

So the options are I: blue. So the answer should be I.

When Curtis stares at a yellow star for a full minute, the cones in his retina that are sensitive to red and green wavelengths (which combine to create the perception of yellow) become fatigued. When he then looks at a white background, the brain perceives the complementary color of yellow, which is blue. This is because the fatigued cones are less responsive to red and green, and the brain compensates by enhancing the perception of blue. Therefore, the afterimage Curtis sees is blue.
