Okay, so I have this problem here about radioactive decay, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's asking. The problem says that 2.000 picograms (pg) of ^33P decays by beta emission to 0.250 pg in 75.9 days. I need to find the half-life of ^33P. Hmm, right, beta emission is when a beta particle is emitted, so it's a beta decay process. But wait, I don't think the type of decay matters for calculating the half-life. Because the decay is just about the nucleus losing mass and emitting particles, but the half-life is a characteristic of the isotope itself, right?

So, the half-life is the time it takes for half of the substance to decay. The formula I remember for radioactive decay is N = N0 * (1/2)^(t / t_half), where N is the remaining quantity, N0 is the initial quantity, t is time, and t_half is the half-life. Alternatively, sometimes it's written using the natural logarithm: ln(N/N0) = -kt, where k is the decay constant, and k = ln(2)/t_half. Maybe that's the way to go.

Let me plug in the numbers I have. The initial quantity N0 is 2.000 pg, and the final N is 0.250 pg. The time t is 75.9 days. I need to find t_half.

Using the formula N = N0 * (1/2)^(t / t_half). Let me rearrange that to solve for t_half.

Divide both sides by N0: N/N0 = (1/2)^(t / t_half)
Take the natural log of both sides: ln(N/N0) = (t / t_half) * ln(1/2)
But ln(1/2) is -ln(2), so ln(N/N0) = - (t ln 2) / t_half

Multiply both sides by -1: -ln(N/N0) = (t ln 2) / t_half
So t_half = (t ln 2) / (-ln(N/N0))

Wait, let me double-check that. Alternatively, I can write it as:

t_half = t / (log2(N0/N)) )

Because if I have N = N0*(1/2)^(t/t_half), then taking logs base 2:

log2(N/N0) = (t/t_half) * log2(1/2) → log2(1/2) is -1, so:

log2(N/N0) = -t/(t_half)

Multiply both sides by -1: t/t_half = -log2(N/N0) → t_half = t / (-log2(N/N0)) 

Wait, log2(N/N0) is log base 2 of (N/N0). Since N is less than N0, N/N0 is less than 1, so log2 of that is negative. So -log2(N/N0) would be positive.

Wait, let me calculate N/N0 first. N is 0.250 pg, N0 is 2.000 pg. So N/N0 is 0.25/2 = 0.125. So N/N0 is 0.125.

Now, ln(0.125) is ln(1/8) which is -ln(8) ≈ -2.079. Alternatively, using base 2, log2(0.125) is log2(1/8)= -3.

So using the formula: t_half = t / (log2(N0/N)) 

N0/N is 2.000 / 0.250 = 8. So log2(8) is 3. So t_half = 75.9 days / 3 = 25.3 days.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because N = N0 * (1/2)^(t/t_half), so when t = t_half, N = N0/2. So if after one half-life, it's 1 pg, after two, 0.5 pg, after three, 0.25 pg. Oh wait, wait a minute. Because N0 is 2 pg, and it's reduced to 0.25 pg, which is 1/8 of the original. So that's three half-lives. Because each half-life reduces it by half. So 2 →1 →0.5→0.25. So three half-lives. So 75.9 days is three half-lives. So each half-life is 75.9 /3 = 25.3 days.

Looking at the options, option I is 25.3 days. So the answer should be I.

To determine the half-life of ^33P, we use the radioactive decay formula:

\[
N = N_0 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t / t_{\text{half}}}
\]

Here:
- \(N_0 = 2.000 \, \text{pg}\) (initial quantity),
- \(N = 0.250 \, \text{pg}\) (remaining quantity),
- \(t = 75.9 \, \text{days}\) (time elapsed),
- \(t_{\text{half}}\) is the half-life to be determined.

Rearranging the formula to solve for \(t_{\text{half}}\):

\[
t_{\text{half}} = \frac{t}{\log_2(N_0 / N)}
\]

First, calculate \(N_0 / N\):

\[
\frac{N_0}{N} = \frac{2.000}{0.250} = 8
\]

Next, calculate \(\log_2(N_0 / N)\):

\[
\log_2(8) = 3
\]

Substitute into the formula for \(t_{\text{half}}\):

\[
t_{\text{half}} = \frac{75.9}{3} = 25.3 \, \text{days}
\]

Thus, the half-life of ^33P is 25.3 days. Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**I: 25.3 days**
