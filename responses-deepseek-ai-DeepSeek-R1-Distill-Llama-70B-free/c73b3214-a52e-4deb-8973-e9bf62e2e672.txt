Question:

A woman inherited her father's farm when he died testate. Prior to her father's death, the woman had already taken over the operations on the father's farm due to his declining health. Recently, the woman had granted a coal company rights to strip-mine coal from underneath the farm. Their agreement stipulated that the coal company would pay the woman a per-ton royalty for the coal extracted. In addition, the coal company agreed to fill in the excavated area and replace top soil on the surface of the land. After the coal company commenced its strip-mining operations, the woman noticed that the company was not filling in the excavated area as previously agreed. However, because the company paid the woman all the coal royalties from the strip mining, she did not voice any objection regarding its failure to replace the top soil. Two years later, the coal company had now completed its strip-mining operation under its arrangement with the woman. The coal company's right to strip-mine coal from the woman's property would be an example of a (an)

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about property law, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand all the details.

So, the scenario is about a woman who inherited her father's farm. Before he died, she took over the farm operations because her father's health was declining. Then, she granted a coal company the right to strip-mine coal from under the farm. Their agreement said the company would pay her a royalty per ton of coal extracted. Also, the company agreed to fill in the excavated area and replace the topsoil. But once they started mining, she noticed they weren't filling in the area as agreed. However, she didn't say anything because they were paying her the royalties. Now, two years later, the mining is done, and the question is about what kind of right the coal company had.

The options are A through J, with various property law terms. I need to figure out which one applies here.

First, I'll try to remember what each term means because that's key here. Let's list out each option and what I know about them.

Option A: Constructive trust. I think that's more about when someone holds property but it's deemed to be held for another, usually due to some wrongdoing. Like in cases of fraud.

Option B: Easement appurtenant. This is an easement that benefits another piece of land (the dominant estate) and is attached to it. It goes with the land, so if the land is sold, the easement continues.

Option C: Servient estate. That's the estate that is burdened by an easement. So, the land that the easement is on is the servient estate. The easement appurtenant would involve a servient estate.

Option D: Voluntary waste. Waste refers to the improper use of property by a tenant that harms the property's value. Voluntary waste is when the tenant intentionally does something harmful.

Option E: License. A license is a personal right to use the land, not an interest in the land. It's revocable and doesn't transfer with the property.

Option F: Easement in gross. This easement isn't tied to a particular piece of land but is a personal right. It can be held by a company or individual, and it doesn't necessarily go with the land when sold.

Option G: Tenancy in common. A form of co-ownership where each has an undivided interest, and there's no right of survivorship.

Option H: Profit-a-prendre. This is a right to take something from another's land, like minerals or timber. It's considered a type of easement.

Option I: Adverse possession. When someone takes possession of land without the owner's consent, and over time, gains title through adverse possession.

Option J: Easement by necessity. Created when a property needs to access something, like a landlocked parcel needing a road easement over a neighboring property. It's based on necessity.

Now, applying these to the scenario. The woman granted the coal company the right to strip-mine. Strip mining involves taking minerals (coal) from the land. She's allowing them to do this, so it's a permission-based arrangement, not adverse. So options I (adverse possession) are out.

She's granting a right to take coal, which is a profit. So profit-a-prendre (option H) seems relevant. Profit is a type of easement that allows someone to remove resources from another's land. So H is a possibility.

Alternatively, easement in gross (F) is when a company has a right that's not tied to land ownership. Or maybe easement appurtenant (B), but that requires the easement to benefit another parcel of land. If the coal company owns adjacent land, maybe, but the question doesn't say that. The coal company is just a company, so perhaps it's an easement in gross.

Wait, but an easement in gross is typically for things like utility lines, where the benefit isn't tied to a specific parcel. A profit, on the other hand, is specifically about taking resources.

So in this case, the coal company has a right to extract coal, which is a profit. So profit-a-prendre (H) would apply. Profit is an easement that allows someone to take natural resources from another's land.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I've heard that profits are a type of easement. So profit-a-prendre is a specific term for that.

Let me think again. The woman gave the coal company the right to mine, so it's a profit. So the company's right is a profit-a-prendre.

So the answer would be H.

Wait, but another thought: easement in gross. Because the coal company is a company, not a landowner. So if the easement benefits the company directly, regardless of any land they own, it's an easement in gross. But profit is a specific type of easement, so maybe it's both.

Wait, what's the difference between easement in gross and profit? An easement in gross is a type of easement that's not tied to land. A profit is a type of easement that allows taking resources. So perhaps in this case, the coal company's right is both an easement in gross and a profit.

But the question is asking for the example. So the right they have is to take coal, which is a profit, so H would be correct.

Alternatively, if the easement in gross is the correct category, then F would be the answer. Wait, perhaps I'm conflating two concepts here. Let me clarify.

Easements can be categorized as appurtenant or in gross. Appurtenant benefits another parcel of land, while in gross benefits a person or company. Profits are a type of easement, regardless of whether they're appurtenant or in gross.

So, in this case, the coal company's right is a profit because it's the right to take coal. Whether it's appurtenant or in gross depends on who holds it. If the company owns another property that's benefited, it's appurtenant. If it's just the company's right regardless of land ownership, it's in gross.

But in this scenario, the company's profit doesn't necessarily tie to another parcel they own. It's just a right granted to the company. So it's a profit in gross, but I don't know if that's a standard term.

Wait, looking at the options, H is "profit-a-prendre" and F is "easement in gross." So which one fits here.

I think that profit-a-prendre is a specific type of easement that allows the extraction of resources. So the right granted here is a profit, making H correct.

Alternatively, if the question is more about how the easement is held (by the company), then perhaps it's an easement in gross because it's a commercial company, but the type of easement is a profit.

Wait, but the question is about what the coal company's right would be an example of. So the key is that it's a right to take something from the land, which is a profit. So the answer should be H.

So I think the correct answer is H.

The question revolves around determining the legal nature of the coal company's right to strip-mine coal from the woman's property. The woman granted the company the right to extract coal, agreeing to royalty payments and certain conditions, such as filling in excavated areas. However, the company failed to meet the condition of replacing the topsoil, though the woman did not object due to receiving royalties. The key issue is identifying the type of property right the coal company holds.

Analyzing the options:

- **Constructive trust (A):** This involves holding property for another due to wrongdoing, which is irrelevant here.
- **Easement appurtenant (B):** Benefits a dominant estate, but the scenario does not indicate the company owns adjacent land benefiting from the easement.
- **Servient estate (C):** Refers to the land burdened by an easement, not the right itself.
- **Voluntary waste (D):** Involves intentional harm to property by a tenant, which does not apply here.
- **License (E):** A revocable, personal right to use land, which does not fit the company's right to extract coal.
- **Easement in gross (F):** A right benefiting a person or entity, not tied to land ownership. While the company's right could be seen as an easement in gross, the specific nature of the right points to a profit.
- **Tenancy in common (G):** A form of co-ownership, irrelevant to this scenario.
- **Profit-a-prendre (H):** A specific type of easement allowing the extraction of resources, such as minerals or timber, which directly applies to the coal company's right to extract coal.
- **Adverse possession (I):** Involves taking possession of land without consent, which is not the case here.
- **Easement by necessity (J):** Created due to a necessity like landlocked property, which does not apply.

The coal company's right to extract coal is best described as a **profit-a-prendre**, as it involves the extraction of resources from the land. While the right could also be classified as an easement in gross, the specific term for this type of easement is **profit-a-prendre**.

Answer: H
