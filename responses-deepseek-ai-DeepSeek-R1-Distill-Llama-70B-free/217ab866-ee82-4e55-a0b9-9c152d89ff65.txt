Question:

A state legislature has recently enacted a statute requiring all prospective voters in state electionswho wish to write-in a candidate to print the candidate's full name, and designate the office for which the candidate is running. The statute provides that such information must be written on the ballot in ink in an appropriate space. A write-in candidate for the office of Attorney General is a Chinese-American. The candidate is of the opinion that he needs a large turnout of Chinese voters in order to win the election. As a result, his campaign manager decides to mail to every registered Chinese voter a tear-off sticker, which bears the candidates name along with the office of Attorney General. Since many native Chinese people are not proficient in reading and writing English, the campaign manager believes that many of the voters will have difficulty writing the candidate's name and office on the ballot. As a result, the campaign manager has mounted an extensive media campaign to inform voters on how to apply the stickers to the ballot. Five months prior to the election an election official notifies the candidate's campaign committee that the tear-off stickers do not comply with the state statute. In her letter, the official explains that state election officials are of the opinion that it is necessary for potential voters to write the candidate's name in ink. Therefore, she concludes that the stickers do not comply with statutory requirements. Three weeks later, the candidate filed suit in federal district court against the election officials, claiming that their interpretation of the state statute violates the U. S. Constitution. Thereafter, one of the candidate's opponents filed suit in state court seeking to prevent state election officials from counting any write-in ballots with stickers. The state court has now scheduled a prompt hearing on this matter. In addition, the state court has indicated that it hopes to render a decision on the merits within the next three weeks. Which of the following statements is correct concerning the federal court's adjudication of the candidate's suit?

Options:

A: The federal court should remand the case to the state court to decide the constitutional issue presented.
B: The federal court should hear the case and make a ruling before the state court.
C: The federal court should refuse to hear the case because it presents a nonjusticiable political question.
D: The federal court should hear the case and defer its decision until after the state court's ruling.
E: The federal court should refuse to hear the case because it is a matter of state law.
F: The federal court should hear the case because the state statute potentially violates federal law.
G: The federal court should refuse to hear the case because it's a matter of electoral law.
H: The federal court should hear the case on the merits.
I: The federal court should refuse to hear the case as it lacks jurisdiction.
J: The federal court should refuse to hear the case because of the abstention doctrine.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about federal court jurisdiction and whether a federal court should hear a case involving a state election law. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: A state legislature passed a statute requiring write-in candidates' names and office designation to be written in ink on the ballot. A Chinese-American candidate is using tear-off stickers to help voters who might not be proficient in English. The election official says the stickers don't comply because voters must write the name in ink. The candidate sues in federal court, claiming the state's interpretation violates the U.S. Constitution. Then, an opponent sues in state court to stop the counting of such ballots, and the state court is moving quickly to decide.

The question is about what the federal court should do with the candidate's suit.

I remember that when there's a case involving both state and federal issues, especially constitutional ones, the federal courts can sometimes choose to abstain. The abstention doctrine comes into play, I think, when there's a difficult state law issue that could avoid a federal constitutional problem. 

So, the candidate is arguing that the state's interpretation of the statute is unconstitutional. The state court is going to interpret the statute, which could resolve the issue without needing to reach the constitutional question. If the state court finds the statute doesn't require writing in ink, then the constitutional issue might be moot. 

The options are about whether the federal court should hear it or not. Option A says remand to state court, but I don't think so because the case is already in federal court. Options B and D suggest the federal court should decide before or after the state court. Option J suggests abstention. 

I think the abstention doctrine, particularly the Pullman abstention, allows federal courts to wait for state courts to interpret state laws to avoid unnecessary constitutional rulings. Since the state court is already considering the issue and will decide soon, the federal court should abstain to let the state court resolve the state law question first. 

So, the correct answer would be J: The federal court should refuse to hear the case because of the abstention doctrine.

The correct answer is based on the principle of abstention doctrine, which allows federal courts to refrain from deciding cases involving unsettled state law issues that could potentially resolve the constitutional question. Since the state court is set to interpret the statute, the federal court should wait for that ruling to avoid unnecessary constitutional adjudication.

J: The federal court should refuse to hear the case because of the abstention doctrine.

Answer: J
