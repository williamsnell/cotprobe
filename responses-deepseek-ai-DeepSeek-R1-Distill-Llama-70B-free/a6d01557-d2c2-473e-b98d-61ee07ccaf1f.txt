Okay, so I've got this question about car insurance and liability. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The situation is that Tom Patrick ran a red light and his car hit another, injuring five people. Now, he has to pay them different amounts through a court action. The amounts are $27,000, $14,000, $6,000, $5,000, and $2,700 respectively. The question is about how much his insurance company will pay, given that he has 50-and-100 bodily injury insurance.

Wait, I remember that in car insurance, the numbers like 50-and-100 refer to the coverage limits. Specifically, I think it's split as follows: the first number is the per-person limit, and the second is the per-accident limit. So 50-and-100 would be $50,000 per person and $100,000 total per accident.

So each injured person can get up to $50,000 from the insurance. Let's see the amounts he has to pay: the first is $27k, which is under 50k. The second is $14k, also under. Then $6k, $5k, and $2.7kâ€”all way below 50k each. So the insurance should cover each of these up to the 50k limit, but wait, actually, the insurance pays up to the policy limit per person, but only if the claim exceeds it. Wait, no, the insurance covers up to the policy limit per person, but the total can't exceed the per-accident limit.

Wait, let me think again. So the per-person limit is $50k. That means for each injured person, the insurance will cover up to $50k. But if the total of all claims exceeds the per-accident limit of $100k, then each claim would be adjusted accordingly. But wait, in this case, let's calculate the total.

The amounts are 27k, 14k, 6k, 5k, 2.7k. Adding them up: 27+14 is 41, plus 6 is 47, plus 5 is 52, plus 2.7 is 54.7k total. But wait, 27+14=41, plus 6 is 47, plus 5 is 52, plus 2.7 is 54.7k. So the total is $54,700.

Now, the per-accident limit is $100k. Since 54.7k is less than 100k, the total amount the insurance will pay is the sum of each claim up to the per-person limit. But wait, each of the individual claims are under 50k, so the insurance will cover each in full because none exceed the per-person limit. So the insurance would pay all the claims, totaling 54,700.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see option J is $54,700. So that must be the answer. But let me double-check. The per-person limit is 50k, but each claim is under that. So the insurance pays each in full. Total is 54,700, which is under the 100k per-accident limit. So yes, the insurance company pays 54,700.

Looking at the options, J is 54,700, which matches.

The question involves determining how much Tom Patrick's insurance company will pay after he caused an accident, injuring five people. The insurance policy is a 50-and-100 bodily injury policy, meaning it provides up to $50,000 per person and up to $100,000 per accident. The court-ordered payments are $27,000, $14,000, $6,000, $5,000, and $2,700, respectively.

Each claim is below the $50,000 per-person limit, so the insurance will cover each claim in full. Adding these amounts together:  
$27,000 + $14,000 + $6,000 + $5,000 + $2,700 = $54,700.  

Since the total ($54,700) is less than the $100,000 per-accident limit, the insurance company will pay the full amount of $54,700.

The correct answer is **J: $54,700**.
