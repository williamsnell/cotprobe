Okay, so I'm trying to answer this geography question. The question is about what a city is called when it's more than twice as large as the next largest city in the country. Hmm, I remember that there are specific terms for different sizes or types of cities. Let me think about what each term means.

First, the options are A through J. The answer must be one of these. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Global city. I think a global city is one that has a lot of influence on the global economy and culture, like New York or Tokyo. It's not necessarily about its size relative to other cities in the country, but more about its international impact. So maybe not A.

Option B: Dominant city. That sounds like it could be a city that's the main one in the country, but I'm not sure if this is the technical term for being more than twice as large as the next. I've heard the term dominant in other contexts, but not sure here.

Option C: Primate city. I remember this term from somewhere. I think a primate city is one that is significantly larger than other cities in the country, often being more than twice as large as the next biggest. That fits the question. So C might be the right answer.

Option D: Metropolitan city. That usually refers to a large city and its surrounding areas, forming a metro area. It's more about the administrative or economic center rather than the size relative to others.

Option E: Superior city. I don't recall this being a standard term in urban geography. It sounds more like a general description rather than a specific classification.

Option F: Magnified city. That doesn't ring a bell. Maybe it's not a real term used in this context.

Option G: Colossal city. That's more descriptive, like extremely large, but again, not a specific term I recognize for this particular definition.

Option H: Megalopolis. That's a term used to describe a large, heavily populated urban agglomeration, like the Boston-Washington corridor in the US. It's more about a region with many cities merging together, not a single city's size relative to others.

Option I: World leader city. That sounds similar to a global city, more about influence rather than size comparison within a country.

Option J: Giant city. Again, this is more about size but not the specific ratio given in the question.

So putting it all together, the term I remember is primate city, which is when a city is more than twice as large as the next largest. So the answer should be C.

The correct answer is C: primate city. A primate city is defined as one that is more than twice as large as the next largest city in the country, fitting the description provided in the question.

Answer: C
