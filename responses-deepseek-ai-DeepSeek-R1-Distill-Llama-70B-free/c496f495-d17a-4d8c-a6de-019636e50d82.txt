Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Reiman's view on van den Haag's arguments regarding the death penalty. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that van den Haag was a proponent of the death penalty. He argued in favor of it, probably on certain moral or ethical grounds. Now, Reiman's critique of thatâ€”what did Reiman say about van den Haag's arguments?

I think Reiman was a critic of the death penalty. I recall that he wrote a book called "The Death Penalty: A Philosophical Introduction." In that, he probably addressed various arguments for and against capital punishment. Van den Haag, on the other hand, was known for defending the death penalty, often using retributive arguments.

So the question is about how Reiman views van den Haag's arguments. The options are A through J, each giving a different perspective.

Option A says the arguments are not based on logical reasoning. That doesn't sound right because van den Haag was a philosopher, so his arguments were likely logical, even if Reiman disagrees.

Option B suggests the arguments are flawed due to lack of empirical evidence. Reiman might argue that van den Haag's points lack empirical support, especially regarding deterrence, but I'm not sure if that's the main point.

Option C says they contradict human rights principles. That's possible, but I'm not certain if that's the exact critique Reiman made.

Option D: follow common sense. Maybe, but I'm not sure if Reiman would agree or say that van den Haag's arguments are based on common sense.

Option E: based on biased principles. That could be, but again, I'm not certain.

Option F: should be accepted. No, because Reiman is critical, so he wouldn't say they should be accepted.

Option G: prove torture is wrong. That seems unrelated. The question is about the death penalty, not torture.

Option H: based on retribution. Van den Haag did use retribution as a basis. So Reiman might be pointing out that his arguments rely on that concept.

Option I: promote capital punishment. Well, yes, van den Haag's arguments do promote it, but the question is about Reiman's critique of those arguments, not just their content.

Option J: incompatible with the right to retaliation. Not sure about that term. Retaliation is part of retribution, so maybe, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the question is about Reiman's arguments against van den Haag. So, if van den Haag supports the death penalty using retribution, Reiman might argue that this is flawed. So, the options are about how Reiman views van den Haag's arguments.

I think Reiman argues that retributive justifications are problematic because they're based on the idea of "an eye for an eye," which might not hold up morally or practically. So, Reiman would likely say that van den Haag's arguments are based on retribution, which is a flawed principle.

So looking back, option H says "are based on the concept of retribution." That makes sense because van den Haag's pro-death penalty stance is indeed grounded in retributive justice. Reiman would point this out as the basis of his arguments.

Alternatively, option B says they're flawed due to lack of evidence. Van den Haag might argue that the deterrent effect is a justification, but if there's no evidence, that's a flaw. But I think the question is more about the moral basis rather than empirical evidence.

So I'm leaning towards option H.

The question asks about Reiman's critique of van den Haag's arguments in favor of the death penalty. Van den Haag, a proponent of capital punishment, often relied on retributive arguments, emphasizing punishment as a form of moral retribution. Reiman, a critic of the death penalty, would likely highlight that van den Haag's arguments are rooted in the concept of retribution, which Reiman finds problematic. Among the options, the most accurate reflection of this critique is that van den Haag's arguments are based on retribution.
