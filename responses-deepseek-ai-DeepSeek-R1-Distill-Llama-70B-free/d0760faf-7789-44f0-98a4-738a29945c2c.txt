Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how many boxes of cat food Rob uses per month. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says that Rob uses 1 box of cat food every 5 days. So, first, I need to find out how many of these 5-day periods are in a month. But wait, how many days are we considering in a month? I think a month is usually about 30 days, right? Sometimes months have 28, 29, 30, or 31 days, but for approximation, 30 days is commonly used.

So, if one box lasts 5 days, I can divide the total days in a month by 5 to find out how many boxes he uses. Let me write that down: 30 days divided by 5 days per box. Hmm, 30 divided by 5 is 6. So that would mean 6 boxes per month. Wait, but let me double-check that.

Wait, 5 days per box... So in 5 days, it's 1 box. So 5 days = 1 box. So 10 days would be 2 boxes, 15 days 3 boxes, 20 days 4 boxes, 25 days 5 boxes, and 30 days 6 boxes. Yeah, that makes sense. So each 5 days adds another box. So 30 divided by 5 is 6 boxes.

Looking back at the options, option C is 6 boxes. So that must be the correct answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. Are there any other factors I might have missed? Like, does Rob have multiple cats? Oh, the question says "to feed his cats," but it doesn't specify the number. So I think the usage is already accounted for in the 1 box every 5 days. So that part is probably fine.

Another thing to consider is leap years or different month lengths, but the question says "per month" and uses "approximately," so 30 days is a safe assumption. So yeah, 6 boxes per month.

To determine how many boxes of cat food Rob uses per month, we start by noting that he uses 1 box every 5 days. Assuming a month is approximately 30 days, we divide 30 by 5, which equals 6. Thus, Rob uses 6 boxes of cat food per month.

Answer: C
