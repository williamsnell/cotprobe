Okay, so I need to solve this problem where I'm given two functions, f(2x) = x + 5 and f(g(6)) = 13. The question is asking for 2 times g(6), and the options are from A to J.

First, let's break down the information given. The function f is defined in terms of 2x. So, f(2x) equals x plus 5. I think I should find the general form of the function f. Maybe I can express f in terms of its input.

Let me set y = 2x. Then, x would be y/2. Substituting back into the equation, f(y) = (y/2) + 5. So, f of any number is that number divided by 2 plus 5. That simplifies f for any input.

Now, the second piece of information is f(g(6)) = 13. Since I know f's general form, I can substitute g(6) into it. Let's let z = g(6). So, f(z) = (z)/2 + 5 = 13. Now I can solve for z.

Setting up the equation: z/2 +5 =13. Subtract 5 from both sides: z/2 =8. Multiply both sides by 2: z=16. So, g(6)=16.

The question asks for 2 times g(6), which is 2*16=32.

Wait, let me double-check. If f(g(6))=13, and f(z)=z/2 +5, then 13= z/2 +5 â†’ z= (13-5)*2=8*2=16. So yes, g(6)=16. Multiply by 2: 32.

Looking at the options, option B is 32. So the answer should be B.

To solve the problem, we start with the given function \( f(2x) = x + 5 \). Letting \( y = 2x \), we can rewrite this as \( f(y) = \frac{y}{2} + 5 \). This gives us the general form of the function \( f \).

Next, we use the second piece of information \( f(g(6)) = 13 \). Substituting \( g(6) \) into the function \( f \), we let \( z = g(6) \). Then, \( f(z) = \frac{z}{2} + 5 = 13 \). Solving for \( z \):

\[
\frac{z}{2} + 5 = 13 \implies \frac{z}{2} = 8 \implies z = 16.
\]

Thus, \( g(6) = 16 \). The question asks for \( 2 \cdot g(6) \), which is:

\[
2 \cdot 16 = 32.
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is **B: 32**.
