Okay, so I've got this 13C NMR question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that the 13C chemical shifts of benzene and chloroform are 128.4 ppm and 77.2 ppm respectively. I need to find the difference in their NMR frequencies on a 600 MHz spectrometer. The options are from A to J, and I have to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the relationship between chemical shift (ppm) and frequency depends on the operating frequency of the spectrometer. Oh right, the formula I think is: 

Δν (in Hz) = (δ2 - δ1) * (spectrometer frequency in MHz) 

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me think again. Oh wait, the chemical shift in ppm is parts per million. So to get the frequency difference, you take the difference in ppm and multiply by the spectrometer's base frequency (in MHz), right? Because each ppm is equivalent to base_freq (MHz) divided by 1e6, but wait, maybe it's base_freq * (difference in ppm) divided by 1e6? Or wait, no, the formula is typically:

frequency (Hz) = (ppm) * (spectrometer frequency in MHz) / 1e6 * 1e6 (since 1 ppm is 1e-6 of the base frequency). Wait, maybe I should clarify.

Wait, the basic formula is that the resonance frequency (ν) is given by ν = (chemical shift) * (operating frequency) / 1e6. Because ppm is parts per million, so you divide by 1e6.

So the difference in frequency would be the difference in ppm multiplied by the operating frequency in MHz, but wait, because MHz is 1e6 Hz. So let me get this straight.

Let me reorganize the formula. The spectrometer's base frequency is 600 MHz, which is 600,000,000 Hz. But each ppm corresponds to a frequency shift relative to that base.

So for a given chemical shift δ (in ppm), the frequency is:

ν = (δ * base_frequency) / 1e6

Because ppm is (δ/1e6) times the base frequency.

So if I have two compounds with δ1 and δ2, their frequencies are ν1 = δ1 * base /1e6 and ν2 = δ2 * base /1e6.

The difference in frequency is ν2 - ν1 = (δ2 - δ1) * base /1e6.

Wait, but in this problem, benzene is 128.4 ppm and chloroform is 77.2 ppm. So the difference in ppm is 128.4 -77.2 = 51.2 ppm.

Wait wait, no: wait, the question says NMR frequencies of the two compounds, so the difference is |128.4 -77.2| = 51.2 ppm.

But wait, wait, so NMR frequencies are in Hz. So the difference in Hz is 51.2 * (600 MHz) / 1e6 ?

Wait, 600 MHz is 600,000,000 Hz, right? So 600 MHz is 6e8 Hz.

Wait, the calculation would be:

Δν (Hz) = (128.4 -77.2) ppm * (600 MHz) * (1e6 Hz / 1e6 ppm)

Wait, no, that might not be the right way. Alternative approach:

Each ppm is equal to (base frequency in Hz)/1e6. So 1 ppm = 600,000,000 Hz / 1e6 = 600 Hz.

Because 600 MHz is 600,000,000 Hz, and 1 ppm is 1e-6 of that. So 600e6 / 1e6 = 600 Hz per ppm.

So each ppm corresponds to 600 Hz.

So the difference in ppm is 51.2 ppm, as I calculated before.

So the frequency difference is 51.2 ppm * 600 Hz/ppm.

Let me compute that: 51.2 * 600 = ?

Well, 50 * 600 is 30,000. 1.2 * 600 is 720. So 30,000 +720= 30,720 Hz, which is 30.72 kHz.

Wait, because 1 kHz is 1000 Hz. So 30,720 Hz is 30.72 kHz.

Looking at the options, option F is 30.7 kHz. So that's probably the right answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. I could have made a mistake.

So 128.4 minus 77.2 is 51.2. Multiply by 600 Hz per ppm.

51.2 * 600:

Let me compute step by step.

51 * 600 = (50 *600) + (1 *600) → 30,000 +600= 30,600.

0.2 *600=120.

So 30,600 +120=30,720 Hz → 30.72 kHz.

Hmm, the option F is 30.7 kHz, which matches this.

Wait, but wait another thing: sometimes NMR calculations may have the formula as (δ * operating frequency) / 1e6. So let me make sure I didn't make a miscalculation.

Alternatively, let's compute using the formula:

Δν = (δ2 - δ1) * (spectrometer frequency in MHz) * 1 Hz/ppm? No, wait. Because chemical shift in ppm is (δ = ν / (base_frequency) ) * 1e6.

Wait, let me think again. The formula for a single shift is:

ν = (δ * base_frequency) / 1e6

Because δ is in ppm, which is parts per million relative to the base frequency.

So if base_frequency is 600 MHz, which is 600e6 Hz.

So for a given δ, ν = (δ * 600e6 ) / 1e6 → which is δ * 600 Hz.

So yes, each ppm is 600 Hz.

So the difference is 51.2 ppm *600 Hz/ppm = 30,720 Hz =30.72 kHz.

Looking at the options, F is 30.7 kHz, which is the closest to our calculation. So that's the answer.

To determine the difference in the 13C NMR frequencies of benzene and chloroform on a 600 MHz spectrometer, we use the relationship between chemical shift (in ppm) and frequency. The formula is:

\[
\Delta \nu \, (\text{Hz}) = (\delta_2 - \delta_1) \times \frac{\text{spectrometer frequency (MHz)}}{1,000,000}
\]

Here:
- The chemical shift of benzene is \( \delta_1 = 128.4 \, \text{ppm} \),
- The chemical shift of chloroform is \( \delta_2 = 77.2 \, \text{ppm} \),
- The spectrometer frequency is \( 600 \, \text{MHz} = 600,000,000 \, \text{Hz} \).

The difference in chemical shift is:

\[
\delta_2 - \delta_1 = 128.4 - 77.2 = 51.2 \, \text{ppm}.
\]

Substituting into the formula:

\[
\Delta \nu = 51.2 \times \frac{600,000,000}{1,000,000} = 51.2 \times 600 = 30,720 \, \text{Hz}.
\]

Converting to kilohertz:

\[
\Delta \nu = \frac{30,720}{1,000} = 30.72 \, \text{kHz}.
\]

From the given options, the closest value is **30.7 kHz**, which corresponds to option **F**.
