Question:

Which of the following is the proper treatment of the cost of equipment used in research and development activities that will have alternative future uses?

Options:

A: Capitalized and depreciated over the term of the research and development project.
B: Expensed as incurred, regardless of the project's term or future use.
C: Capitalized and depreciated over its estimated useful life.
D: Expensed in the year in which the research and development project started.
E: Either capitalized or expensed, but not both, depending on the term of the research and development project.
F: Capitalized but not depreciated.
G: Capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the research and development project, unless the equipment has no alternative future uses.
H: Either capitalized or expensed, depending on the potential success of the research and development project.
I: Expensed in the year in which the research and development project is completed.

Okay, so I need to figure out the correct accounting treatment for the cost of equipment used in R&D activities when it has alternative future uses. Hmm, I remember from my accounting class that R&D costs are generally expensed as incurred, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exceptions. Let me think.

I think for R&D, most costs are expensed right away. But wait, there's an exception for materials, equipment, and intangible assets. Right, if the equipment has alternative future uses, it's treated differently. So instead of expensing it immediately, you capitalize it. But then, how do you handle the depreciation?

So the general rule is that R&D costs are expensed as incurred, but if the equipment can be used for other purposes beyond the R&D project, it should be capitalized. That makes sense because if it's useful beyond the current project, it's a long-term asset. So the cost is recorded as an asset on the balance sheet and then depreciated over its useful life.

Looking at the options, option C says "Capitalized and depreciated over its estimated useful life." That sounds right because it's about the equipment's overall usefulness, not tied to just the R&D project's duration.

Option A suggests depreciating over the project's term, which doesn't seem correct because the equipment has alternative uses beyond the project. So the useful life is longer than just the project term.

Option B says expensed as incurred regardless, but that's only if there's no alternative use. Since the question states there are alternative uses, B isn't correct.

Option G mentions depreciating over the project's useful life unless no alternative uses. Wait, no, the correct approach is to depreciate based on the equipment's useful life, not the project's. So G doesn't seem right.

So the correct answer must be option C. The equipment is capitalized and depreciated over its estimated useful life because it has alternative future uses beyond the current R&D project.

The correct treatment for the cost of equipment used in research and development (R&D) activities that has alternative future uses is to capitalize the cost and depreciate it over its estimated useful life. This approach aligns with accounting principles, which generally expense R&D costs as incurred but allow for capitalization when the asset has alternative future uses beyond the current project. Depreciation should reflect the equipment's overall useful life rather than being tied to the project's term.

- **Option A** is incorrect because depreciation should be based on the equipment's useful life, not the project's term.
- **Option B** is incorrect because it applies only when there are no alternative future uses, which is not the case here.
- **Option C** is correct as it properly reflects capitalizing the equipment and depreciating it over its estimated useful life.
- **Option G** is incorrect because depreciation should not be based on the project's useful life but on the equipment's overall useful life.

The best answer is **C**.
