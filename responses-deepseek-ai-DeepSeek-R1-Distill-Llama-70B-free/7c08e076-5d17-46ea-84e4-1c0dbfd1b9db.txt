Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the mass of a helium isotope from a nuclear reaction. Hmm, I remember that these kinds of problems involve using mass conservation and the concept of Q-value. Let me think through this step by step.

The reaction given is _3Li^6 + _1H^1 → _2He^4 + _2He^3. Oh wait, right, the notation is a bit tricky. The numbers before the elements are the atomic numbers, which are the protons, and the superscripts are the mass numbers, which are protons plus neutrons. So lithium-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, hydrogen-1 is just a proton, and the products are helium-4 and helium-3.

The question gives me the masses of hydrogen-1 (1.00813 amu), helium-4 (4.00386 amu), and lithium-6 (6.01692 amu). I need to find the mass of the helium-3 isotope, which is _2He^3.

Wait, but how do I approach this? Oh right, in nuclear reactions, the mass before and after reaction might not balance because of the Q-value. The Q-value is the energy released or absorbed in the reaction. If Q is positive, energy is released, and so the initial mass is higher than the final. Or is it the other way around? Let me think. Oh right, according to Einstein's equation E=mc², if mass is converted into energy, the system's mass decreases. So a positive Q means energy is released, implying that the initial mass is greater than the final. So the mass difference times c squared gives the Q-value.

But wait, the Q-value is given as 3.945 MeV. So I need to relate the mass difference to this energy.

The initial mass is the sum of the reactants: lithium-6 and hydrogen-1. The final mass is the sum of the two helium isotopes.

Let me write this out. Initial mass = mass of Li-6 + mass of H-1. Final mass = mass of He-4 + mass of He-3.

So the mass difference (initial - final) would be the mass lost, which is converted into energy (Q). So:

Initial = 6.01692 + 1.00813 = let's calculate that. 6.01692 + 1.00813 = 7.02505 amu.

Final = 4.00386 (He-4) + m(He-3), where m is what we're trying to find.

The mass difference is (7.02505) - (4.00386 + m) = (7.02505 -4.00386) - m = 3.02119 - m.

Wait, but wait. The Q-value is the energy released, which comes from the mass defect. So the mass of the reactants minus the mass of the products equals the mass defect (Δm), which when multiplied by c² gives the energy.

But I'm mixing up units here. The masses are in amu, and the Q is in MeV. I need to convert the mass difference into energy units.

I remember that 1 amu is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So Δm * c² = Q.

So, the mass difference (Δm) is (initial mass) - (final mass) = [ (Li + H) - (He4 + He3) ) ].

Wait no, correct formula: Δm = (mass of reactants) - (mass of products) = (Li + H) - (He4 + He3).

So Δm is positive if the reactants are more massive than products, so energy is released (Q positive). Which it is here.

So, let's compute Δm:

Li is 6.01692, H is 1.00813. Sum is 7.02505.

Products: He4 is 4.00386, He3 is what we're solving for. Let me call He3's mass m.

So, Δm = (6.01692 + 1.00813) - (4.00386 + m) = (7.02505) - (4.00386 + m) = (7.02505 -4.00386) - m = 3.02119 - m.

Wait, no, wait. Δm is initial - final. So:

Δm = (6.01692 + 1.00813) - (4.00386 + m) = 7.02505 -4.00386 - m = 3.02119 - m.

But wait, that would be (7.02505 -4.00386) = 3.02119, so 3.02119 - m = Δm.

But the Q-value is given as 3.945 MeV, which must equal Δm * 931.5 MeV/amu.

So, Q = Δm * 931.5.

So,

3.945 MeV = (3.02119 - m) amu * 931.5 MeV/amu.

We can solve for (3.02119 - m) = Q / 931.5.

Plugging in Q = 3.945:

3.02119 - m = 3.945 / 931.5.

Let me compute 3.945 / 931.5.

Hmm, 931.5 is about 1e3, so 3.945 / ~1e3 is ~0.003945.

Let me compute it more accurately.

931.5 goes into 3.945 how many times?

3.945 / 931.5 = approximately 0.004235.

Wait, let me compute it:

931.5 * 0.0042 = approx 3.9138.

Which is close to 3.945. Let's see:

0.0042 *931.5 = 3.9138.

The difference is 3.945 -3.9138= 0.0312.

So 0.0312 /931.5 ≈ 0.0000334.

So total is 0.0042334 amu.

So,

3.02119 - m = 0.0042334.

So m = 3.02119 - 0.0042334 = 3.0169566 amu.

Wait, that's approximately 3.01696 amu.

Looking at the options, option I is 0.01696, which is too small. Option D is 3.01603, which is close but not exact. Hmm, wait wait, perhaps I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, let me check the calculation again.

Δm = (Li + H) - (He4 + He3) = (6.01692 + 1.00813) - (4.00386 + m) = 7.02505 -4.00386 -m =3.02119 - m.

Δm = (3.945 MeV) / (931.5 MeV/amu) ) = 3.945 / 931.5 ≈ 0.00423 amu.

So,

3.02119 - m = 0.00423

Therefore,

m = 3.02119 -0.00423 = 3.01696 amu.

Looking at the options, option D is 3.01603, which is a bit lower than my calculation. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial masses?

Wait, let me recheck the initial sum.

Li-6 is 6.01692, H-1 is 1.00813. Sum is 6.01692 + 1.00813 = 7.02505 amu. Correct.

He-4 is 4.00386, He-3 is m.

So,

7.02505 = 4.00386 + m + Δm.

Wait, no, because Q is energy released, so the initial mass is larger than the final, so initial = final + Δm.

Wait, I think I got the formula correct earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express it as:

Δm = (Li + H) - (He4 + He3) = (6.01692 + 1.00813) - (4.00386 + m) = 7.02505 -4.00386 -m = 3.02119 -m.

Then, Δm c² = Q → Δm = Q/(c²), but since c² is in MeV/amu, the conversion is 1 amu = 931.5 MeV.

So,

Δm = 3.945 / 931.5 ≈ 0.00423 amu.

So,

3.02119 - m = 0.00423 → m = 3.02119-0.00423=3.01696 amu.

Looking at the options, I don't see that exact number. Wait, the options are:

Option D: 3.01603 amu.

Option E: 5.01222.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation, perhaps an error in the initial masses.

Wait, the question says the Q-value is 3.945 MeV. Did I use that correctly? Yes, I think so.

Let me recheck the division: 3.945 /931.5.

3.945 ÷ 931.5 = ?

Let me compute this more accurately.

931.5 * 0.00423 = ?

0.004 *931.5=3.726.

0.00023 *931.5= 0.214245.

So total 3.726 + 0.214245 = 3.940245.

Close to 3.945. So perhaps 0.00423 is correct.

Wait, 3.940245 is a bit less than 3.945. So the exact value is 3.945 / 931.5.

Let me compute 3.945 ÷ 931.5.

3.945 ÷ 931.5 ≈ 0.00423 amu.

So,

m = 3.02119 - 0.00423 = 3.01696 amu.

Wait, the closest option is D:3.01603. Hmm, that's a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, maybe I should write the equation differently. Let me try again.

The Q-value is the energy released, which comes from the mass difference.

So,

Δm c² = Q.

Δm = (mass of reactants) - (mass of products).

The reactants are Li6 and H1.

Products are He4 and He3.

So,

Δm = (Li6 + H1) - (He4 + He3).

Li6 is 6.01692, H1 1.00813 → sum 7.02505.

He4 is 4.00386, He3 is m.

So,

Δm = 7.02505 - (4.00386 + m) = 7.02505 -4.00386 -m = 3.02119 - m.

Then,

Δm = Q/(c²) → 3.945 MeV / 931.5 MeV/amu = 0.00423 amu.

So,

3.02119 - m = 0.00423 → m = 3.02119 -0.00423 = 3.01696 amu.

So, the mass of He3 is approximately 3.01696 amu.

Looking back at the options, none of them are exactly this number. Hmm.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option D: 3.01603 amu.

Hmm, that's close but not exact. Could it be that I made an error in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should compute the division more accurately. Let me compute 3.945 / 931.5.

Compute 3.945 ÷ 931.5.

Let me write it as:

3.945 / 931.5 = (3.945 * 1e4) / (931.5 *1e4) ) = 39450 / 93150000.

Wait, perhaps a better way is just to compute it with a calculator.

Wait, 931.5 goes into 3.945 how many times.

931.5 * 0.0042 = 3.9138.

The difference between 3.945 and 3.9138 is 0.0312.

So 0.0312 /931.5 = 0.00003346.

So total is 0.0042 + 0.00003346 = 0.00423346 amu.

So Δm = 0.00423346 amu.

So,

3.02119 - m = 0.00423346.

So m = 3.02119 -0.00423346 = 3.01695654 amu.

Rounded to five decimal places, that's 3.01696 amu.

But looking at the options, the closest is D:3.01603, which is about 0.00093 amu less. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the initial sum is wrong.

Wait, 6.01692 (Li) +1.00813 (H) = 7.02505. Correct.

He4 is 4.00386, so 7.02505 -4.00386 = 3.02119. Correct.

Hmm. Unless there's a mistake in the way the equation is set up. Maybe the Q-value is the mass of the products minus the reactants? No, that can't be, because Q is positive when energy is released, which implies that the reactants are more massive.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the mass of the products.

Wait, let me write it as:

Li6 + H1 → He4 + He3 + Q.

Where Q is 3.945 MeV.

So,

mass_defect = (Li + H) - (He4 + He3) = Q/c².

Which is what I did earlier.

Hmm, perhaps I should check the calculation once more.

Wait, maybe the Q-value is given as the kinetic energy, but I think for such problems, the assumption is that the Q-value is based on the mass difference.

Alternatively, perhaps the given masses are for neutral atoms, and in that case, we would need to account for the electrons, but the problem doesn't mention that. The masses given are all in amu, and since all are atomic masses, perhaps the electrons are included. Wait, but in nuclear reactions, sometimes the masses are atomic, and sometimes they are just the nuclei. Oh, wait, when dealing with atomic masses, electrons are included, but in nuclear reactions, the electrons are usually considered as part of the atom, but the reaction involves nuclei.

Hmm, but the given masses are atomic, so perhaps we need to account for the electrons in the reactants and products.

Wait, the reaction is _3Li^6 + _1H^1 → _2He^4 + _2He^3.

So, the Li-6 has 3 electrons, H-1 has 1, so total of 4 electrons on the left.

On the right, He-4 has 2 electrons, He-3 has 2, so total 4 electrons as well. So electrons balance, so their masses are included in the atomic masses given. So perhaps the calculation is correct as is.

Wait, but if the H is actually a proton, then perhaps the mass given is that of a proton, not a hydrogen atom. Wait, but no, the mass given is for H-1, which is a proton plus an electron? Or is it the atomic mass.

Wait, the question says the masses are of _1H^1, which is hydrogen-1. The atomic mass of H includes the proton and the electron. Similarly, Li and He masses are their atomic masses, including electrons.

So in the reaction, when considering atomic masses, the electrons are accounted for, so the mass difference includes the mass of the nuclei, and the electrons' mass cancels out.

But in that case, the calculation as done earlier is correct.

So with that, the mass of He-3 is approximately 3.01696 amu.

Looking back at the options, the closest is D:3.01603. But that's not exact. Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to not approximate the division so much.

Let me compute 3.945 /931.5 exactly.

3.945 ÷931.5.

Let me compute 3.945 ÷931.5.

Let me write it as 3945 ÷ 931500.

Wait, perhaps compute 3.945 ÷931.5.

Well,

931.5 * 0.00423 = 3.940245.

The difference is 3.945 -3.940245=0.004755.

So 0.004755 /931.5= approx 0.0000051.

So total is 0.00423 + 0.0000051=0.0042351.

So,

Δm =0.0042351 amu.

So,

3.02119 - m = 0.0042351 → m =3.02119-0.0042351= 3.0169549 amu ≈3.01695 amu.

So, perhaps the question expects the answer to be approximately 3.01695 amu. Looking at the options, D is 3.01603, which is 0.00092 less. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial sum.

Let me recheck the initial sum:

Li:6.01692, H:1.00813.

6.01692 +1.00813 = 7.02505.

Yes.

Products: He4 is 4.00386, He3 is m.

Li + H = 7.02505.

He4 + He3 =4.00386 +m.

Δm =7.02505 - (4.00386 +m) =3.02119 -m.

Yes.

So, perhaps the options are using more precise calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate 3.945 /931.5 more accurately.

Let me compute 3.945 ÷931.5.

I can write it as 3.945 ÷931.5 = (3.945 × 1e5) ÷ (931.5 ×1e5) = 394500 ÷93150000.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to do it step by step.

931.5 × 0.0042 = 3.9138.

3.945 -3.9138=0.0312.

0.0312 ÷931.5 = 0.00003346.

So, total is 0.0042 + 0.00003346=0.00423346 amu.

So Δm=0.00423346 amu.

Thus, m=3.02119 -0.00423346=3.01695654 amu.

So, 3.016956
