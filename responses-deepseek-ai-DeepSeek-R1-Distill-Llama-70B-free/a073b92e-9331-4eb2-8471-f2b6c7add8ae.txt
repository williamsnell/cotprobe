Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about the amplitude of a plane wave in a medium. Let me see what I remember from my electromagnetism class. The question gives me the relative permeability μr = 1 and the relative permittivity εr = 4. The magnetic field amplitude Ho is 5 amp/meter. I need to find two things: the average Poynting vector (which is like the average power per unit area) and the maximum energy density.

Alright, let's break this down. I think the Poynting vector S is given by the cross product of E and H, but since we're dealing with the average, maybe it's the product of the root mean square (rms) values of E and H. Oh wait, for a plane wave, the average Poynting vector is (1/2) * E0 * H0, because E and H are in phase and perpendicular.

Wait, no, wait. The instantaneous Poynting vector is E × H, and the average value for a sinusoidal wave is (1/2) E0 H0. So S_avg = (1/2) * E0 * H0. But wait, I have H0 given as 5 A/m. I need to find E0 first.

Hmm, how are E and H related in a plane wave? Oh right, the intrinsic impedance of the medium comes into play. The intrinsic impedance η is given by η = η0 / sqrt(με_r), but wait, μr is 1, so μ = μ0. So η = η0 / sqrt(εr). Since η0 is approximately 377 ohms, and εr is 4, sqrt(4) is 2. So η = 377 / 2 = 188.5 ohms.

Wait wait, no. Wait, the intrinsic impedance of a medium is η = sqrt(μ/ε). Oh wait, because in terms of the medium's properties, μ = μ0 μr, ε = ε0 εr. So η = sqrt( (μ0 μr) / (ε0 εr) ) ) = η0 * sqrt(μr/εr). Since η0 is sqrt(μ0/ε0), and μr is 1, εr is 4. So η = η0 * sqrt(1/4) ) = η0 / 2. So yes, η is 377 / 2 = 188.5 ohms.

So E0 = η * H0. H0 is 5 A/m, so E0 = 188.5 * 5. Let me compute that: 188.5 *5 = 942.5 V/m.

Now, the average Poynting vector S_avg is (1/2) E0 H0. So substituting the values: (1/2) * 942.5 *5. Let's calculate that. 

942.5 *5 = 4712.5. Half of that is 2356.25 W/m². Hmm, looking at the options, option B says S_AV=2354 W/m², which is very close. Maybe I should double-check my calculations.

Wait, let me recompute E0. η is 188.5 ohms. H0 is 5 A/m. So 188.5 *5 is indeed 942.5 V/m. Then S_avg is (1/2)(942.5)(5). Let me compute 942.5 *5: 942.5 *5=4712.5. Half of 4712.5 is 2356.25. So 2356.25 W/m². The closest option is B: 2354. Maybe due to rounding; perhaps the exact value uses more precise numbers.

Now part (b), the maximum energy density. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. The energy density in an electromagnetic wave has two components: electric and magnetic. The average energy density is the sum of the average electric and average magnetic energy densities. But wait, the question asks for the maximum energy density. Oh right, because the average is for when the fields are varying sinusoidally, the maximum would be when the fields are at their peak amplitudes.

The electric energy density is (1/2) ε E0², and the magnetic is (1/2) μ H0². Since maximum energy occurs when both are at their peaks, so the total maximum energy density is the sum of these two.

So first, calculate each. Let's compute electric energy density: (1/2) ε E0². ε is ε0 εr. ε0 is approximately 8.85e-12 F/m. εr is 4, so ε = 4 * 8.85e-12 = 35.4e-12 F/m.

E0 is 942.5 V/m. So (1/2) * 35.4e-12 * (942.5)^2. Let me compute this.

First, (942.5)^2: 942.5 *942.5. Let me approximate. 900^2=810000, 42.5^2=1806.25, and cross terms 2*900*42.5 = 76500. So total is 810000 + 76500 +1806.25 = 888,306.25.

So (1/2)*35.4e-12 * 888306.25 = 0.5 *35.4e-12 * 8.8830625e5.

Wait, 888306.25 is 8.8830625e5. So 35.4e-12 *8.8830625e5 = let me compute 35.4 *8.8830625 = approximately 35*8.88 is about 311.  So 35.4 *8.8830625 = let's compute exact:

35 *8.8830625 = 311. So 0.4 *8.8830625 = ~3.553. So total about 311 +3.553=314.553. So 314.553e-7 (because 1e-12 *1e5=1e-7).

Wait, no: 35.4e-12 *8.883e5 = (35.4 *8.883e5) *1e-12. Wait, 35.4 *8.883e5 = 35.4 *8.883 *1e5. Let me compute 35.4 *8.883 first.

35 *8.883 = 311. So 0.4 *8.883=3.553. So total 311 +3.553=314.553. So 314.553e5 *1e-12 = 314.553e-7 = 3.14553e-5.

Multiply by 0.5: 0.5 *3.14553e-5 = 1.572765e-5 J/m³.

Wait, but that's just the electric part. Now the magnetic part: (1/2) μ H0². μ is μ0 μr, which is 4πe-7 *1 =4πe-7 H/m.

H0 is 5 A/m. So (1/2) *4πe-7 *5².

5 squared is 25. So (1/2)*4πe-7 *25 = 2 *πe-7 *25 = 50 πe-7.

50 *3.1416e-7 ≈ 157.08e-7 = 1.5708e-5 J/m³.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Let me recheck. (1/2) * μ * H0^2. So μ is 4πe-7 H/m. H0 is 5 A/m.

So (1/2) *4πe-7 *5^2 = (1/2)*4πe-7*25 = (50 π e-7) ) / 2? No, wait: (1/2)*4πe-7 *25 = (4πe-7 *25)/2 = (100πe-7)/2 = 50πe-7.

Wait, 4πe-7 *25 is 100πe-7. Divided by 2 is 50πe-7. So yes, 50 *3.1416e-7 is approximately 1.5708e-5 J/m³.

So the electric energy density is approximately 1.572765e-5 J/m³, and the magnetic is 1.5708e-5 J/m³. Adding them together gives about 3.1435e-5 J/m³. So 3.1435e-5 is 3.14 ×10^-5 J/m³.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have 3e-5. Let me check the options again.

Option C has W_peak =3.0e-4 J/m². Oh wait, wait, no, wait, the options are in terms of 10^-4, which is 1e-4. So 3.14e-5 is 0.314e-4. Hmm, but that's not matching any option. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, no, wait. The maximum energy density would be when both electric and magnetic fields are at their peak. So the maximum energy density is the sum of the maximum electric and magnetic energy densities. So the maximum would be (1/2) ε E0² + (1/2) μ H0².

Wait, but earlier I did (1/2) ε E0² = 1.57e-5, and same for H. So sum is 3.14e-5 J/m³, which is 3.14 ×10^-5 J/m³. But the options are in 1e-4. So 3.14e-5 is 0.314e-4. But none of the options have 0.314e-4. Hmmm.

Wait, did I compute correctly? Let me double-check. Maybe I messed up the exponents.

Electric energy density: (1/2) * ε * E0².

ε = ε0 * εr = 8.85e-12 *4 = 3.54e-11 F/m.

E0 = 942.5 V/m.

So (1/2) *3.54e-11 * (942.5)^2.

Compute (942.5)^2: as before, 942.5^2 is 888,306.25.

So 3.54e-11 *888306.25 = ?

3.54e-11 * 8.8830625e5 = let me compute 3.54 *8.883e5 = 3.54 *8.883e5 = 3.54 *8.883 = 31.45, and times 1e5 (since 8.883e5 = 8.883 *1e5). So 31.45 *1e5 *1e-11 = 31.45e-6.

Wait, 3.54e-11 *8.883e5 = 3.54 *8.883e5 *1e-11 = (3.54 *8.883) *1e-6. 3.54 *8.883 is about 31.45. So 31.45e-6. Then multiply by 1/2: 15.725e-6 J/m³, which is 1.5725e-5 J/m³.

Magnetic energy density: (1/2) * μ0 * H0^2.

μ0 =4πe-7 H/m. H0=5 A/m.

So (1/2)*4πe-7*(5)^2 = 0.5 *4πe-7 *25 = 0.5 *100πe-7 = 50πe-7.

50 *3.1416e-7 is approx 1.5708e-5 J/m³.

So sum is 1.5725e-5 +1.5708e-5 = 3.1433e-5 J/m³, which is 3.1433e-5 = 3.143 ×1e-5 = 3.143 ×10^-5 J/m³.

But wait, the options for part (b) are in the range of 2.5e-4 to 4.2e-4. So I'm getting 3.14e-5, which is 0.314e-4, but the options are higher. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I forgot to consider something. Oh wait, maximum energy density might not be the sum of the average energy densities. Because the average energy density is (1/2)(ε E0² + μ H0² ), but the maximum occurs when both E and H are at their maximum, so perhaps the maximum energy is (1/2) ε E0² + (1/2) μ H0², which is the same as the average energy density times 2, because the average is (1/2) that sum.

Wait, no. Wait, the average energy density is (1/2)(ε E0² + μ H0² ), because E and H vary sinusoidally, so their squares average to half their peak values. So the maximum would be twice the average. So if average is W_avg = (1/2)(W_e + W_m), then maximum is W_max = W_e + W_m = 2 W_avg.

Wait, but that would mean that the maximum energy density is 2 times the average. But I'm getting that the sum of the maximum electric and magnetic is 3.14e-5 J/m³, which would be the maximum. But looking back, the options for part (b) are in the 1e-4 range, which is ten times higher. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the energy density differently. Let me think again.

The energy density is (ε E²)/2 + (B H²)/(2μ). But wait, B is μ H, so B² is μ² H². So (B H²)/(2μ) becomes (μ H² * H² )/(2μ) )= (μ H^4 )/(2μ) )= H^4 /2, which doesn't make sense. No, wait, no, that's not the right approach. Let me think.

Wait, no, the magnetic energy density is (B·H)/2. Or, alternatively, B²/(2μ). Because B=μ H, so B²/(2μ) = (μ H)^2 / (2μ) )= μ H² /2.

Wait, that's correct. So the magnetic energy density is (μ H^2)/2. So earlier, I computed (1/2) μ H0², which is correct.

Wait, let me recalculate the electric and magnetic energy densities.

Electric:

(1/2) ε E0² = 0.5 * (4 * ε0) * (942.5)^2

= 0.5 *4 *8.85e-12 * (942.5)^2

Wait, 0.5 *4 is 2. So 2 *8.85e-12 * (942.5)^2.

942.5 squared is 888,306.25.

So 2 *8.85e-12 *888306.25 = 2 *8.85 *888306.25e-12.

Compute 8.85 *888306.25 first.

8 *888306.25 =7,106,450

0.85 *888306.25 = 755,360.625

So total 7,106,450 +755,360.625=7,861,810.625.

Multiply by 2: 15,723,621.25e-12 = 1.572362125e-5 J/m³.

Magnetic:

(1/2) * μ0 * H0² = 0.5 *4πe-7 *5^2.

5 squared is 25. So 0.5 *4πe-7 *25 = 0.5 *100πe-7 =50πe-7.

50 *3.1416e-7 =157.08e-7 =1.5708e-5 J/m³.

Adding both: 1.57236e-5 +1.5708e-5 =3.14316e-5 J/m³ ≈3.143e-5 J/m³.

So that's 3.143e-5 J/m³. Which is 3.143 ×10^-5 J/m³.

Looking at the options, the part (b) is the maximum energy density. Let me look back at the options:

Option C: W_peak=3.0e-4 J/m². Wait, no, J/m² and J/m³ are different. Wait, the question says "maximum energy density for this plane wave." Energy density is in J/m³.

Looking at the options, let me check each option's part (b):

Option C: W_peak =3.0 ×10^-4 J/m². Wait, that's J/m², which is incorrect because energy density is J/m³. Hmm, perhaps it's a typo in the options. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options list "W_peak" as part (b), which I assume is the maximum energy density. But the units in the options are "×10^-4 joule/meter^2", which is J/m². That can't be right. Energy density is in J/m³. So maybe the options have a mistake, but perhaps I should proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the peak energy density differently. The maximum energy density occurs when E and H are at their maximum, so E = E0 and H = H0. So the energy density is (ε E0²)/2 + (μ H0²)/2.

Wait no, that's the same as before. So I get 3.14e-5 J/m³. Looking at the options, none have that. Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps the question meant to ask for the average energy density, but the question states maximum. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere.

Wait, another approach: the average Poynting vector S_avg is 2356 W/m². The average power is related to the energy density. The energy density's average is (S_avg * sqrt(μ ε)) )/c, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thing: the speed of light in the medium is v =1 /sqrt(
