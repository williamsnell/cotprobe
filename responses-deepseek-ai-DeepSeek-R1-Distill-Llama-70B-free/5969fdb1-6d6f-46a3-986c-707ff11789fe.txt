Question:

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this sociology question about anorexia and why it's considered an epidemic in Western cultures, according to Bordo from 1993. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I remember that sociologists often look at cultural factors influencing behaviors and disorders. Anorexia is an eating disorder, so it's probably tied to societal norms or ideals. 

The options are A through G. Let me go through each one.

Option A says it's due to the rise in stress and anxiety. That makes sense to some extent because stress can lead to eating issues, but I'm not sure if Bordo specifically points to stress as the main cause. I think she's more about cultural ideals rather than individual psychological factors like stress.

Option B suggests an ascetic and frugal lifestyle taken to extremes. Asceticism is about self-discipline and denying oneself pleasures, which could relate to anorexia. But I'm not sure if that's the main argument. It might be part of it, but maybe not the primary reason.

Option C talks about fast food and obesity. That seems counterintuitive because anorexia is about being underweight, not overweight. So I don't think this is the right answer.

Option D is lack of awareness about diet and exercise. That doesn't sound right because anorexia is more about distorted body image and control, not just lack of knowledge.

Option E mentions social construction of mental illness, where normal behaviors are pathologized. That's an interesting point. Sociologists do discuss how society defines what's normal and what's not. If certain behaviors are labeled as illnesses, maybe that's why anorexia is seen as an epidemic. But I'm not sure if Bordo's main argument is about pathologization.

Option F refers to traditional images of women being emotional and domestic. I think Bordo might discuss how women's roles have changed and how that affects eating disorders. But I'm not certain if she's focusing on the traditional roles or the new ideals.

Option G is about the new ideal of independent, self-assured femininity with values of achievement and control. This rings a bell. I think Bordo argues that with the rise of feminism, women are expected to be independent and successful, but this pressure can manifest in controlling their bodies through eating disorders. So anorexia might be a way women cope with the stress of achieving in a society that values thinness and control.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused between E and G. E is about constructing mental illness, while G is about cultural ideals. I think Bordo's work "Unbearable Weight" discusses how the cultural ideal of thinness and the control of the body reflects societal expectations, especially on women. So it's more about the cultural values of achievement and control, which ties to option G.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be G.

The question asks about Bordo's (1993) attribution of the 'epidemic' of anorexia in Western cultures. Bordo's work focuses on cultural factors, particularly the societal expectations placed on women. Option G aligns with her argument that the rise of anorexia is linked to the new ideal of independent, self-assured femininity, combined with cultural values of achievement and control. This reflects how societal pressures to conform to ideals of thinness and self-discipline can manifest in eating disorders like anorexia.

Answer: G
