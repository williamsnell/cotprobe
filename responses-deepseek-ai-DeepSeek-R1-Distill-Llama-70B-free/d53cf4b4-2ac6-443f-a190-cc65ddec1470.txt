Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about liquidity of assets. The question is asking why common stocks or bonds are considered more liquid than an automobile. I remember that liquidity has to do with how quickly an asset can be converted into cash without losing value. So, I need to think about the characteristics of stocks, bonds, and automobiles in terms of their liquidity.

First, let me break down each option to understand them better.

Option A: Automobiles depreciate faster. Hmm, depreciation does affect value, but I'm not sure if that's directly related to liquidity. Depreciation is more about the asset losing value over time. Liquidity is about how easily it can be sold for cash. So maybe this isn't the main reason, but I'll keep it in mind.

Option B: Stocks and bonds are physically smaller. Wait, physical size doesn't really matter here. Stocks and bonds are often digital now, existing as electronic entries. But even if they were physical, size doesn't directly impact liquidity. I don't think this is the right answer.

Option C: Automobiles are more expensive. Okay, cars can be expensive, but I'm not sure how that affects liquidity. Expensive items might actually take longer to sell because there are fewer buyers, but I'm not certain. High-value items can sometimes be illiquid because not everyone can afford them. So maybe this plays a role, but is it the main reason?

Option D: Highly efficient and fast markets exist for stocks and bonds. This rings a bell. I remember that stocks and bonds are traded in organized markets with high volumes. This means there are many buyers and sellers at any given time, so you can sell them quickly without affecting the price much. That sounds like high liquidity. So this option seems correct.

Wait, let me think again. What makes an asset liquid? It's about being able to sell it quickly and without much loss in value. So cars might not have as active a market. You have to find a buyer, negotiate, maybe spend time and money on advertising. Whereas stocks can be sold almost instantly through stock exchanges. So yes, the presence of efficient markets would make stocks and bonds more liquid. 

So putting it together, the correct answer should be D. Let me just double-check the other options. A is about depreciation, which affects value but not necessarily how quickly it can be sold. B is about size, which I don't think matters. C is about cost, which might influence some aspects but not the main liquidity factor. So D is definitely the right choice.

The correct answer is based on understanding liquidity, which refers to how quickly an asset can be converted into cash without significant loss of value. Stocks and bonds are more liquid than automobiles because they are traded in highly efficient and fast markets with many buyers and sellers, allowing for quick transactions without greatly affecting prices. This is not primarily about depreciation (A), physical size (B), or cost (C), but rather the market efficiency (D).

Answer: D
