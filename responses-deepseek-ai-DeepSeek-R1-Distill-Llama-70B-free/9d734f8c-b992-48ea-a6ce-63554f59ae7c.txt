Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says: There's a solid plastic cube with uniform density. The side length is 0.5 meters, and the mass is 100 kg. It's placed in a vat of fluid with a density of 1200 kg/m³. The question is asking what fraction of the cube's volume floats above the fluid's surface.

Hmm, right, I remember buoyancy and floating from my physics class. So when an object floats, the buoyant force equals the weight of the object. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I should probably think it through.

First, let me list out the given data to organize what I have.

- The cube is made of plastic and has uniform density. So its density is the same throughout.
- Side length of the cube, a = 0.5 m. Since it's a cube, all sides are equal, so volume would be a³.
- Mass of the cube, m = 100 kg.
- Fluid density, ρ_fluid = 1200 kg/m³.

I think I need to find the volume of the cube that's submerged versus the volume above the fluid. The fraction above would be 1 minus the fraction submerged.

Wait, but how do I find the submerged volume? Oh right, buoyancy. The buoyant force is equal to the weight of the displaced fluid, which in equilibrium equals the weight of the cube.

So the weight of the cube is mg, where g is acceleration due to gravity, approximately 9.8 m/s². But maybe I don't need to calculate g because it will cancel out.

Let me think. The buoyant force F_b is equal to the weight of the displaced fluid. So F_b = (volume submerged) * ρ_fluid * g.

And this must equal the cube's weight, which is m * g. So setting them equal:

m * g = V_submerged * ρ_fluid * g.

Oh wait, the g's cancel out on both sides. So:

m = V_submerged * ρ_fluid.

But wait, the mass of the cube is 100 kg. So:

100 kg = V_submerged * 1200 kg/m³.

So solving for V_submerged:

V_submerged = 100 / 1200 = 1/12 m³.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because 100 divided by 1200 is 0.08333... which is 1/12. So V_submerged is 1/12 m³.

But wait, let's make sure. Because the cube's own density must come into play. Because if the cube were denser than the fluid, it would sink, and less would float. But in this case, I'm not sure about the cube's density. So maybe I should calculate it first.

Wait, the cube's mass is 100 kg, and the volume of the cube is a³. Side length is 0.5 m, so a = 0.5 m. Volume V_cube = (0.5)^3 = 0.125 m³.

So the cube's density is ρ_cube = mass / volume = 100 kg / 0.125 m³ = 800 kg/m³.

Oh, right, because density is mass over volume. So the cube's density is 800 kg/m³, which is less than the fluid's density of 1200 kg/m³. Wait, wait, no, that's the opposite. Oh wait, no, wait: if the cube's density is less than the fluid's density, then the cube would float with part submerged. Because lower density objects float in higher density fluids.

Wait, no, no. Wait, if the fluid's density is higher than the cube's, the cube will float. Because for floating, the average density of the object must be less than the fluid's density. Wait, no: the object's average density compared to the fluid's determines whether it floats or sinks. If the object's density is less than the fluid's, it floats; if more, it sinks.

So here, cube's density is 800, fluid is 1200. So cube is less dense than the fluid, so it would float, so only part is submerged.

But wait, my earlier calculation gave V_submerged as 1/12 m³. But the cube's total volume is 0.125 m³, which is 1/8 m³. Wait, 0.125 is 1/8 (since 1/8 = 0.125). So 1/12 is less than 1/8? No, wait, 1/12 is approximately 0.0833, which is less than 0.125. So that would mean that the submerged volume is 1/12 m³, and the rest is above. But wait, that doesn't make sense because if the cube is less dense than the fluid, the entire cube would float with part submerged. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait. Let's re-express this.

The cube's mass is 100 kg. The fluid's density is 1200 kg/m³.

The buoyant force equals the cube's weight, which is 100 kg * g.

The buoyant force is the weight of the displaced fluid, so that would be V_submerged * ρ_fluid * g.

Setting them equal:

100 kg * g = V_submerged * 1200 kg/m³ * g.

Cancel g:

100 = 1200 * V_submerged.

So V_submerged = 100 / 1200 = 1/12 m³.

But the cube's volume is (0.5)^3 = 0.125 m³ = 1/8 m³.

Wait a second, 1/12 is less than 1/8. Because 1/12 is approximately 0.0833, and 1/8 is 0.125.

So that would imply that the submerged volume is 1/12 m³, and the volume above is 1/8 - 1/12 = (3/24 - 2/24) = 1/24 m³. So the fraction above is (1/24) / (1/8) = (1/24) * (8/1) )= 8/24 = 1/3.

Wait, that can't be right. Because when an object is less dense than the fluid, it floats with part submerged. But according to this, the submerged volume is less than the cube's volume. But wait, that can't be, because the cube's density is 800 kg/m³, which is less than the fluid's 1200 kg/m³. So the cube should float, and only part of it is submerged.

Wait, no. Wait, no, when an object is less dense than the fluid, it will float, and the fraction submerged is (density of object)/(density of fluid). Wait, is that correct?

I think the formula is that the fraction submerged (the volume submerged divided by the total volume) is equal to the ratio of the object's density to the fluid's density, but only if the object's density is less than the fluid's. Otherwise, it sinks.

Wait, let me get this straight. The fraction submerged is (ρ_object) / (ρ_fluid). But only when ρ_object < ρ_fluid, because otherwise the object would sink entirely.

So let's compute that. ρ_cube = 800 kg/m³, ρ_fluid = 1200 kg/m³.

So fraction submerged is 800 / 1200 = 2/3.

Wait, that's the fraction submerged. So the fraction above would be 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.

Wait, so that's different from my earlier calculation. So which one is correct?

Wait, I'm getting conflicting results here. Earlier I had V_submerged = 1/12 m³, but according to the fraction submerged as 2/3, then V_submerged should be (2/3) * V_cube.

V_cube is 0.125 m³. So (2/3)*0.125 = 0.08333 m³, which is 1/12 m³. So that's consistent. So the submerged volume is 1/12 m³, which is 2/3 of the cube's volume, because 0.125 * (2/3) is 0.0833.

Wait, wait, that can't be. Because 2/3 of 0.125 is 0.0833..., which is 1/12. So yes, that's correct.

So, the fraction submerged is 2/3, so the fraction above is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.

So the answer would be 1/3 of the cube's volume is above the surface.

Looking at the options, option H is 1/3.

Wait, but earlier I thought the cube's density is less than the fluid, so it floats. So in that case, the fraction submerged is (ρ_cube)/(ρ_fluid) = 800/1200 = 2/3.

Yes, that makes sense. So the fraction above is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.

So the correct answer should be H: 1/3.
</think>

To determine the fraction of the cube's volume that floats above the fluid's surface, we analyze the situation using buoyancy principles. The cube has a side length of 0.5 m, so its total volume is:

\[
V_{\text{cube}} = a^3 = (0.5)^3 = 0.125 \, \text{m}^3 = \frac{1}{8} \, \text{m}^3.
\]

The cube's mass is 100 kg, and its density is calculated as:

\[
\rho_{\text{cube}} = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{volume}} = \frac{100}{0.125} = 800 \, \text{kg/m}^3.
\]

The fluid has a density of \( \rho_{\text{fluid}} = 1200 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \). Since the cube's density (\( \rho_{\text{cube}} = 800 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \)) is less than the fluid's density (\( \rho_{\text{fluid}} = 1200 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \)), the cube will float, with only a portion of its volume submerged.

The fraction of the cube's volume that is submerged is given by the ratio of the cube's density to the fluid's density:

\[
\text{Fraction submerged} = \frac{\rho_{\text{cube}}}{\rho_{\text{fluid}}} = \frac{800}{1200} = \frac{2}{3}.
\]

Thus, the fraction of the cube's volume that floats above the fluid's surface is:

\[
\text{Fraction above} = 1 - \text{Fraction submerged} = 1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**H: \( \frac{1}{3} \).**
