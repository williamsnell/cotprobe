Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about two single-phase alternators operating in parallel. Hmm, let's see what the question is asking.

Part (a) says that one alternator has a sine wave with an effective voltage of 100 volts, and the other has a square flat-top waveform with the same effective voltage. I need to find the maximum instantaneous circulating current between them. Both have a synchronous impedance of 3.68 ohms.

Wait, I remember that when two AC sources are connected in parallel, the circulating current depends on the difference in their voltages. Since they're in synchronism, their frequencies are the same. But the waveforms are different—sine and square. So the difference in voltage isn't just a DC offset; it's more about the harmonic content.

Oh right, the maximum instantaneous current would occur when the difference between the two waveforms is greatest. Let me think about the waveforms. A sine wave and a square wave. The square wave can be represented by its Fourier series, which has odd harmonics. The fundamental component of a square wave is (4/π) times the amplitude, but wait, the problem says the effective (rms) voltage is 100 V for both.

Wait, the effective voltage for a square wave is calculated differently. For a square wave, the rms is equal to the amplitude times the duty cycle factor. For a square wave that's symmetric (50% duty cycle), the rms is V_max / sqrt(2). Because the square wave's rms is V_p / sqrt(2), where V_p is the peak voltage. So for an rms of 100 V, the peak would be 100 * sqrt(2) ≈ 141.42 V.

But the sine wave has an rms of 100 V, so its peak is 100 * sqrt(2) as well. Wait no, wait. Wait, for a sine wave, the peak is V_peak = V_rms * sqrt(2). So for both, the rms is 100 V, so their peaks are the same? That can't be right, because their waveforms are different.

Wait, no. Wait, the square wave's rms is V_rms = V_peak / sqrt(2), so if the square wave's rms is 100 V, then V_peak is 100 * sqrt(2) ≈ 141.42 V. The sine wave's peak is 100 * sqrt(2) as well. So their peaks are the same. But their wave shapes are different. So when you subtract them, the difference will have a varying value.

Wait, but for maximum instantaneous current, I think we need to find the maximum value of the difference between the two waveforms. So let's model the two waveforms.

Let me define the sine wave as E1 = E_max * sin(ωt), and the square wave as E2. Wait, the square wave goes flat at +V_peak and -V_peak. So for a flat-top square wave, it's a square that's high for a certain time and low for another. But for a single-phase, maybe it's a square wave that alternates between +V and -V every half cycle. So the square wave would have a waveform that's a square, but only in the positive half for 180 degrees and negative for 180 degrees. So it's a square wave with a 100% modulation, meaning it's a square wave with 50% duty cycle but only in each half-cycle.

Wait, but that's a bit confusing. Let me think again. Each alternator is single-phase, so their output alternates. So the square wave alternator would produce a waveform that's +V_peak for half the cycle and -V_peak for the other half. So the square wave is a rectangular waveform switching between V_peak and -V_peak every half cycle.

Wait, so E2 would be a square wave with amplitude V_peak. But the effective voltage (rms) is 100 V. So for a square wave, the rms is V_peak / sqrt(2) because the rms is calculated as the square root of the average of the square. Since the square wave is symmetric, the rms is V_peak / sqrt(2) as I thought. So V_peak = 100 * sqrt(2) ≈ 141.42 V.

The sine wave also has an rms of 100 V, so its peak is the same, 141.42 V. So E1 = 141.42 sin(ωt), and E2 is a square wave switching between +141.42 and -141.42 V at the same frequency, since they're in synchronism.

So the difference in voltage between the two machines is E1 - E2. The maximum instantaneous current would be when this difference is maximum, divided by the synchronous impedance.

Wait, but the question says the two machines are connected in parallel, so the circulating current is due to the difference in their terminal voltages. The maximum current would be when the voltage difference is maximum.

So the maximum E1 - E2 occurs when E1 is at its peak positive and E2 is at its peak negative, or vice versa. Wait, but both E1 and E2 are in phase? No, because they are in synchronism, but one is sine and the other is square. Wait, but the square wave might have the same fundamental frequency as the sine wave but with higher harmonics.

Wait, but for the maximum difference, perhaps we need to find the peak of E1 minus E2.

Wait, but the square wave can be represented as a sum of sine waves, but the fundamental component is (4/π) * V_peak * sin(ωt). Wait, no. Let me think again. The Fourier series for a square wave (with 50% duty cycle) is (4/π) times the sum of sine terms at odd harmonics. The fundamental (first harmonic) is (4/π) times V_peak times sin(ωt). Wait, but wait, the peak of the square wave is V_p, so the Fourier series would have terms like (4 V_p)/(π (2n+1)) ) sin( (2n+1) ω t ), for n=0,1,2...

So the fundamental component of the square wave is (4 V_p)/(π) ) sin(ωt). But wait, considering that the rms of the square wave is V_rms = V_p / sqrt(2), which is given as 100 V. So V_p = 100 * sqrt(2) ≈ 141.42 V.

So the fundamental component's rms is (4 V_p)/(π * sqrt(2)) ) * (1/ sqrt(2)) ), wait, maybe I should think in terms of peak values.

Alternatively, the fundamental component's peak is (4 V_p) / π. So for V_p = 141.42 V, the fundamental's peak is (4 * 141.42)/3.1416 ≈ (565.68)/3.1416 ≈ 180 V.

Wait, but that can't be, because that's higher than the original square wave's peak. Hmm, wait no, the Fourier series gives the decomposition. The square wave's fundamental component is 4V_p/(π) in peak. So for V_p=141.42 V, that's about 180 V. But the sine wave has a peak of 141.42 V. So when the two are connected in parallel, the fundamental components might interfere.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think differently. Since the two machines are in parallel, the voltage difference drives the current. The maximum current occurs when the voltage difference is maximum. The impedance is the synchronous impedance, which is 3.68 ohms for each. But when connected in parallel, the total impedance would be... wait, no, it's not exactly parallel impedance. Wait, the circulating current is determined by the difference in voltages and the sum of the impedances?

Wait, no. Each machine has its own synchronous impedance, so when connected in parallel, the total impedance for the circulating current would be the sum of their impedances. Because each current flows through each machine's impedance. So the total impedance Z_total = Z1 + Z2 = 3.68 + 3.68 = 7.36 ohms.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Synchronous impedance is the impedance of each machine. So when two machines are connected in parallel, the effective impedance is Z1 in parallel with Z2, but since the current is circulating between them, perhaps the impedance is the sum. Hmm. Maybe I should model it as each machine contributing their impedance to the loop.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the Thevenin equivalent. Wait, perhaps the maximum current is (V1_max - V2_max) / (Z1 + Z2), but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about each machine's Thevenin voltage. Each machine can be represented as a voltage source behind its synchronous impedance. So for machine 1, the internal voltage is E1 (sine wave), and for machine 2, E2 (square wave). The two are connected in parallel, so the current flowing between them is (E1 - E2) / (Z1 + Z2). But E1 and E2 are time-varying.

Wait, but the question is about the maximum instantaneous current. So the maximum value of (E1 - E2) divided by (Z1 + Z2). Because the current i = (E1 - E2)/(Z1 + Z2).

So to find the maximum i, we need the maximum (E1 - E2). Since E1 and E2 are functions of time, their difference can vary.

E1 is a sine wave: E1 = V1_peak * sin(ωt)
E2 is a square wave: let's say it's V2_peak for 0 < ωt < π, and -V2_peak for π < ωt < 2π.

But wait, the square wave alternates between +V2_peak and -V2_peak every half cycle. So considering that, let's model E2 as a square wave.

Wait, but both have the same rms voltage. So, as calculated earlier, for the square wave, V2_peak = 100 * sqrt(2) ≈ 141.42 V. Similarly, the sine wave's V1_peak is also 141.42 V.

So E1 = 141.42 sin(ωt)
E2 is a square wave switching between +141.42 and -141.42 at every half cycle.

So when is E1 - E2 maximum?

Let me imagine E2 is at +141.42 during 0 to π, and -141.42 during π to 2π.

At some time t, E1 is positive, and E2 is positive. The difference E1-E2 would be lower. But when E1 is positive and E2 is negative, that would maximize E1-E2.

Wait, but E2 is in square wave that changes every half cycle. So when E2 is at +V2, E1 is positive, so E1-E2 = (141.42 sinθ) - 141.42. The maximum of this occurs when sinθ is maximum (1), so E1-E2 would be 141.42(1) -141.42 = 0. That's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I should consider when E2 is at -V2_peak. So when E2 is -141.42, and E1 is at its positive peak, 141.42, then E1 - E2 = 141.42 - (-141.42) = 282.84 V.

That's a big difference. So the maximum voltage difference is 2*141.42 = 282.84 V.

Then the maximum current is 282.84 V divided by the total impedance.

Wait, but earlier I thought the total impedance is Z1 + Z2 = 7.36 ohms. So I_max = 282.84 / 7.36 ≈ let's calculate that.

282.84 / 7.36 = approximately 38.4 A. But wait, that can't be right because the options are in the range of 11-16 A for part (a).

Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake. Where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps the voltage difference isn't 2 times the peak. Maybe I'm confusing the waveforms. Let me think again.

Wait, the square wave is a flat-top, so perhaps it's a unidirectional voltage? Or is it alternating like a sine wave?

Wait, the problem says it's a square flat-top wave form of 100 volts effective. So perhaps the square wave is a single polarity, but that doesn't make sense for an alternator. Alternators produce AC, so the square wave must alternate between positive and negative every half cycle.

Wait, but when considering the maximum difference between E1 and E2, it's when E1 is at peak positive and E2 is at peak negative, so their difference would be 141.42 + 141.42 = 282.84 V.

But the options for (a) are maximum currents around 13-16 A. So 282.84 / (7.36) is about 38 A, which is way higher than the options. So my approach must be wrong.

Ah, I think I see the mistake. The effective voltage (rms) is 100 V for both. But when calculating the maximum possible instantaneous difference, perhaps we should consider the peak values relative to their rms. Wait, for the sine wave, the peak is 100 * sqrt(2) ≈ 141.42 V. For the square wave, the effective is 100 V, so as I said before, the peak is 141.42 V.

But wait, the square wave's peak is 141.42 V, but its rms is 100 V. So when the square wave is at its peak, it's 141.42 V. But the sine wave's peak is the same, so when one is at +141 and the other at -141, the difference is 282 V.

But then 282 V divided by (3.68 + 3.68) = 7.36 ohms gives about 38 A. But the options don't have that. So I must be wrong.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the question is considering only the fundamental component of the square wave. Because the square wave has higher harmonics, but when connected in parallel, perhaps only the fundamental components interact. So the fundamental of the square wave is (4/π) * V_peak. Wait, no, the fundamental's rms is (4 V_peak)/(π * sqrt(2)) ) ? Let's compute that.

V_peak for square wave is 141.42 V. The fundamental component's rms would be (4 * 141.42) / (π * sqrt(2)) ) ≈ (565.68) / (4.4429) ≈ 127.32 V rms.

The sine wave's rms is 100 V. So the difference in their rms voltages would be 127.32 - 100 = 27.32 V. Then the current would be 27.32 / (3.68 + 3.68) = 27.32 / 7.36 ≈ 3.71 A. But that's way lower than the options. Hmm, that can't be right either.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is treating the maximum instantaneous voltage as the peak of each, but considering that the square wave is flat-topped, so when one is at peak, the other is at zero? No, that doesn't make sense because both are AC and in synchronism.

Wait, maybe considering phase angles. If both are in exact synchronism, their phase angles are the same. So at any instant, E1 = E2. So the voltage difference would be zero. But that can't be right because they have different waveforms.

Wait, no. Because E1 is a sine wave and E2 is a square wave, even if they are synchronized, their waveforms differ. So their instantaneous voltages can differ.

Wait, perhaps the maximum difference occurs when E1 is at its maximum and E2 is at zero. Let me think: the square wave is flat-topped. So during the flat top, its voltage is at +V_peak, and in the transition, it goes to -V_peak. Wait, but for a square wave in an alternator, it's not a pure square wave because it can't change instantaneously; it's more like a quasi-square wave with flat tops and possibly some ramping, but for this problem, it's considered an ideal square.

Wait, perhaps the maximum difference occurs when the square wave is at its peak, and the sine wave is at zero. Because sine wave goes through zero while square wave is at peak.

So let's model E1 = 141.42 sin(ωt), and E2 = 141.42 square wave. Let's say at time t = 0, E1 is zero and E2 is at +141.42 V. At that moment, E1 - E2 = -141.42 V. The difference is -141.42 V, so the current is -141.42 / 7.36 ≈ -19.23 A.

But wait, the maximum instantaneous current would be when the difference is maximum in either direction. So the maximum would be when E1 is at +141.42 and E2 is at -141.42, giving a difference of 282.84 V. Then current is 282.84 / 7.36 ≈ 38.4 A. But this isn't matching any of the options, so I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the machines are connected in parallel, and the voltage across each machine is the same. So the terminal voltage V is the same for both. The internal voltages are E1 and E2, and the current is (E1 - V)/Z1 = (E2 - V)/Z2. But wait, that's more of a steady-state parallel operation of two generators.

Alternatively, when two generators are connected in parallel, the circulating current is due to the difference in their internal generated EMFs. The maximum current would be when this difference is maximum.

Wait, but the EMFs E1 and E2 are time-varying, so their difference varies over time. So the maximum current is the maximum of (E1 - E2) divided by (Z1 + Z2), since the currents would circulate through both impedances.

Hmm, but in that case, using (E1 - E2)_max / (Z1 + Z2) would give the maximum current.

So E1 is a sine wave, E2 is a square wave. Let me find the maximum of E1 - E2.

E1(t) = V1_peak sin(ωt)
E2(t) = V2_peak * sign(sin(ωt + π/2)) ? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of Fourier series. The square wave can be expressed as E2(t) = (4 V2_peak / π) [sin(ωt) + (1/3) sin(3ωt) + (1/5) sin(5ωt) + ... ]
