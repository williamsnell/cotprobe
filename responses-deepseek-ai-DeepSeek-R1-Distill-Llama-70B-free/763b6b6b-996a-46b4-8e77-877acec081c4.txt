Question:

A state imposes a tax on nonresident photographers who operate photographic studios in the state at a rate of 2% of their state-derived income above $12,000. This income tax exempts taxable income earned outside of the state by photographers who live in the state. Moreover, resident-photographers of the state are not taxed on their in-state earned income. A photographer who operates a studio in the state but is a resident of another state, challenges the constitutionality of this tax. Which of the following provisions would furnish the most applicable basis for this constitutional challenge?

Options:

A: The commerce clause.
B: The right to work clause of the Fifth Amendment.
C: The supremacy clause of Article VI.
D: The freedom of speech clause of the First Amendment.
E: The privileges and immunities clause of ArticleIv.
F: The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
G: The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
H: The right to a fair trial clause of the Sixth Amendment.
I: The right to privacy clause of the Fourth Amendment.
J: The establishment clause of the First Amendment.

Okay, so I have this question about constitutional law, specifically dealing with taxes and photographers. Hmm, let me try to break it down. 

The question says that a state is imposing a tax on nonresident photographers. These photographers run studios in the state but live elsewhere. The tax is 2% on their state-derived income above $12,000. But here's the thing: the state exempts income earned outside the state for photographers who live there. Also, resident photographers aren't taxed on their in-state income. So, a nonresident photographer is challenging this tax's constitutionality.

I need to figure out which constitutional provision would be the basis for this challenge. The options are from A to J, each a different clause or amendment.

Let me think about the possible constitutional issues here. Taxes often relate to commerce clause issues because states can't unduly burden interstate commerce. But another possibility is the Privileges and Immunities Clause, which deals with discrimination against nonresidents.

Wait, the Commerce Clause (option A) is about whether a state law improperly burdens interstate commerce. If the tax affects out-of-state businesses more than in-state ones, that could be a problem. But I'm not sure if that's the main issue here.

Then there's the Privileges and Immunities Clause in Article IV (option E), which says states can't discriminate against citizens of other states in terms of fundamental rights, like earning a livelihood. So if the state is taxing nonresidents differently, that might violate this clause.

In this case, nonresident photographers are taxed on their in-state income above $12k, while residents aren't taxed on their in-state income. So nonresidents are being treated differently. That sounds like discrimination based on residency.

Wait, but I remember a Supreme Court case, Toomer v. Witsell, which dealt with nonresident shrimpers being taxed more. The Court said that states can't impose higher taxes on nonresidents if it affects their ability to compete. So it's about equal treatment under the Privileges and Immunities Clause.

Another angle might be the Equal Protection Clause (option G), which is part of the Fourteenth Amendment. It requires that similarly situated individuals be treated equally. But I think the Privileges and Immunities Clause is more directly about discrimination against out-of-staters.

So the photographer is a nonresident, and the tax applies only to them, not to residents. That's a clear distinction based on residency. So the challenge would likely be under the Privileges and Immunities Clause because it's about the state treating nonresidents differently concerning their ability to earn income.

Alternatively, could it be the Commerce Clause? The Commerce Clause would be about whether the tax affects interstate commerce. If the tax is applied in a way that hinders out-of-state businesses, that's a commerce issue. But in this case, the tax seems to be more about residency status than directly impeding commerce. So maybe the Privileges and Immunities is the better fit.

Wait, but I should consider: does the tax create an undue burden on interstate commerce? Nonresident photographers might be less likely to operate in the state if they're taxed more. But the tax here is only on their in-state income, which is a common practice. Wait, no: the state is taxing nonresidents on their in-state income, but not taxing residents on their in-state income. So residents pay no state tax on their in-state income, while nonresidents do. That seems like a clear differential treatment based on residency.

So under the Privileges and Immunities Clause, states can't impose taxes that treat nonresidents differently without a substantial reason. In Toomer v. Witsell, the Court held that South Carolina couldn't impose a higher license fee on nonresident shrimpers because it affected interstate commerce and violated the Privileges and Immunities Clause. Similarly, here, the state is taxing nonresidents on their in-state income while exempting residents. That could be seen as discrimination against nonresidents regarding their privilege to work and earn income in the state.

Therefore, the most applicable basis would be the Privileges and Immunities Clause, which is option E.

The question involves a state imposing a tax on nonresident photographers operating studios within the state, while exempting resident photographers from taxation on their in-state income. The nonresident photographer challenges the constitutionality of this tax. The key issue is whether the tax discriminates against nonresidents, violating constitutional protections.

The Commerce Clause (option A) could apply if the tax unduly burdens interstate commerce, but the tax here is specifically based on residency rather than directly impeding commerce. The Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV (option E) is more directly relevant, as it prohibits states from discriminating against nonresidents regarding fundamental rights, such as the ability to earn a livelihood. The tax in question treats nonresidents differently by taxing their in-state income while exempting residents, which aligns with the type of discrimination addressed by this clause.

The Equal Protection Clause (option G) could also be considered, as it requires equal treatment for similarly situated individuals. However, the Privileges and Immunities Clause is more specific to discrimination based on residency and is the stronger basis for this challenge. 

Thus, the most applicable constitutional provision for this challenge is the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV.
