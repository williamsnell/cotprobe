Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the cost of covering a floor with asphalt tiles. Hmm, let's see. The floor dimensions are 13 feet 6 inches by 18 feet 8 inches, and the tiles are priced at 9 and 3/4 cents per 9-inch tile. I need to figure out the total cost. Alright, let me break this down step by step.

First, I think I should convert all measurements to the same unit to make the calculations easier. The floor dimensions are in feet and inches, and the tile size is in inches. So it makes sense to convert the floor into inches.

Starting with the first dimension: 13 feet 6 inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, right? So 13 feet is 13 * 12 = 156 inches. Adding the 6 inches, that gives 156 + 6 = 162 inches.

Next, the second dimension is 18 feet 8 inches. 18 feet is 18 * 12 = 216 inches, plus 8 inches makes 224 inches.

Now, to find the area of the floor in square inches, I multiply these two. So 162 inches * 224 inches. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 160 * 224 is 35,840, and 2 * 224 is 448. So adding them together, 35,840 + 448 = 36,288 square inches. Okay, that's the total area to cover.

Each tile is 9 inches on each side, so the area per tile is 9 * 9 = 81 square inches. Now, I need to find out how many tiles are required. So I'll divide the total area by the area of one tile. 

36,288 / 81. Let me compute that. 81 goes into 36,288 how many times? Well, 81 * 448 is 36,288 because 80 * 448 is 35,840 and 1 * 448 is 448, so 35,840 + 448 = 36,288. So I need 448 tiles.

But wait, sometimes when tiling, you might need to cut tiles, which could affect the number needed. But since the problem doesn't mention any waste or cutting, I'll assume we can get exactly 448 tiles without any issues.

Now, the cost per tile is 9 and 3/4 cents. Let me convert that mixed number to a decimal. 3/4 is 0.75, so each tile is 9.75 cents.

So the total cost in cents would be 448 tiles * 9.75 cents per tile. Let me calculate that. 448 * 9 is 4032, and 448 * 0.75 is 336. So 4032 + 336 = 4368 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, I divide by 100. So 4368 / 100 = $43.68.

Wait, looking at the options, I don't see $43.68 exactly. The closest options are G: $43.88 and I: $45.00. Hmm, that's odd. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I messed up the area conversion. Let me recalculate the area of the floor.

13'6" is 13 * 12 + 6 = 162 inches. 18'8" is 18 *12 +8 = 224 inches. So the area is 162 *224. Let me compute that again. 160 * 224 is 35,840, plus 2*224=448, giving 36,288. That seems right.

Each tile is 9 inches, so area is 81. 36,288 /81 is indeed 448 tiles.

Cost per tile is 9.75 cents. 448 *9.75 = ?

Hmm, maybe I should compute it differently. 448 * (10 - 0.25) = 448 *10 =4480 minus 448 *0.25=112. So 4480 -112=4368 cents, which is $43.68.

But wait, maybe I'm not accounting for something. Oh! Because the tiles are priced at 9.75 cents each, and the total is 4368 cents, which is $43.68. Looking at the options, the closest is G: $43.88. But wait, that's not matching exactly.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider if the tiles are sold in some other unit, like per pack, but the problem says per 9" tile. So each tile is 9.75 cents.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating 448 *9.75. Let me do that multiplication again.

448 *9 = 4032.

448 *0.75 = 336. So total is 4032 +336 =4368 cents, which is $43.68.

Looking at the options, G is $43.88, which is 20 cents higher. Hmm. Maybe I made an error in the area calculation.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the floor's area is in square feet, and I should convert the tile size to feet as well. Let me try that.

Wait, the tile is 9 inches, which is 0.75 feet (since 12 inches =1 foot). So each tile's area is 0.75 ft *0.75 ft = 0.5625 square feet.

The floor's area in square feet: 13.5 feet (13'6") * 18.666... feet (18'8" is 18 +8/12=18.666...). So 13.5 *18.666... Let me compute that.

13 *18=234, 13*0.666=8.666, 0.5*18=9, 0.5*0.666≈0.333. So adding all together: 234 +8.666=242.666, plus 9=251.666, plus 0.333=252. So approximately 252 square feet.

Wait, wait, that's not accurate. Let me compute 13.5 * 18.6667 precisely.

13.5 *18 =243. 13.5 *0.6667 ≈9.0 (since 13.5 *2/3 ≈9). So total is about 243 +9=252 square feet.

Each tile is 0.5625 sq ft. So number of tiles is 252 /0.5625 = let's compute that. 0.5625 is 9/16. So 252 * (16/9) = ?

252 /9 =28; 28 *16=448 tiles. Same as before.

So cost is 448 * $0.0975 (since 9.75 cents is 0.0975 dollars). Let me compute 448 *0.0975.

Hmm, 448 *0.1 is 44.8. But 0.0975 is 0.1 -0.0025.

So 448 *0.1=44.8; 448 *0.0025=1.12. So 44.8 -1.12=43.68.

So again, $43.68. But the options don't have exactly this amount. The closest is G: $43.88, which is 20 cents higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different unit or there's a mistake in the options. Alternatively, maybe I made an error in conversion somewhere.

Wait another possibility: Maybe the price is 9 3/4 dollars per tile? No, that can't be because the price is given as 9 3/4 cents. So that's correct as 0.0975 dollars.

Alternatively, perhaps the tiles are priced per square foot, but no, the problem says per 9-inch tile.

Wait, perhaps the tiles are priced per pack, but the question says per tile.

Alternatively, maybe I miscalculated the number of tiles. Let me check that again.

Wait, 162 inches by 224 inches. 162 *224 = 36,288. Each tile is 81, so 36,288 /81 =448. Correct.

Hmm, maybe the answer options are rounded. Let's see, $43.68 is approximately $43.70, but the option G is $43.88, which is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the initial area calculation is correct. Let me compute 162 *224 again.

Another way: 160*224=35,840. Then 2*224=448. So 35,840 +448=36,288. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects to account for any waste or extra tiles, but the question doesn't mention that. So I think the calculation is correct.

Looking back at the options, maybe I made a mistake in the cost per tile. Let me check: 9 3/4 cents is 9.75 cents per tile. Yes.

Wait, perhaps the initial area was wrong. Let me compute 13'6" × 18'8" again.

13'6" is 13.5 feet, and 18'8" is 18.666... feet. So 13.5 * 18.666... Let me use calculator-like steps.

13.5 * 18 = 243.

13.5 * 0.666666... = Approximately 9.

So total area is 243 +9 = 252 square feet. Correct.

Each tile is 0.75 ft × 0.75 ft =0.5625 sq ft.

Number of tiles: 252 /0.5625 =448. Correct.

So 448 tiles * $0.0975 = $43.68.

But none of the options exactly match this. Wait, looking at the options:

A: $42.50

B: $49.99

C: $46.25

D: $40.75

E: $47.50

F: $48.95

G: $43.88

H: $51.20

I: $45.00

J: $44.00

So G is $43.88, which is 20 cents higher. Hmm. Where could I have gone wrong?

Wait, perhaps the price is 9 and 3/4 cents per tile, which is 9.75 cents per tile. But wait, 9.75 cents is $0.0975.

Wait, perhaps the cost is per square foot of tile, but no, the problem says per tile.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the tiles are priced per square foot, not per tile. Let me check the problem statement again.

The price is 9 3/4 cents per 9" tile. So per tile, it's 9.75 cents. So my calculation is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the price per square foot instead of per tile. Let me try that.

Each tile is 0.5625 square feet. So per square foot, the cost would be 9.75 cents /0.5625 sq ft.

Wait, 0.0975 dollars per tile. So per square foot, it's 0.0975 /0.5625 = approximately $0.1733 per square foot.

So total cost is 252 sq ft * $0.1733 = let's compute that. 252 *0.1733 ≈43.68 dollars. So same result.

Hmm. So the correct cost is $43.68, but the options don't have that exactly. The closest is G: $43.88.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error in 448 *0.0975.

Let me compute 448 *0.0975 again.

0.0975 is the same as 975/10000.

But perhaps breaking it down: 448 * (0.09 + 0.0075) = 448*0.09 +448*0.0075.

448 *0.09 = 40.32.

448 *0.0075 = 3.36.

Adding them: 40.32 +3.36=43.68.

So yes, $43.68.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be rounded up to the nearest cent, but that's already done.

Looking at the options, maybe the intended answer is G: $43.88, but that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the area calculation.

Wait, let me compute the area in square feet correctly. 13.5 ft *18.6667 ft.

13.5 *18=243.

13.5 *0.6667= Let's compute precisely.

0.6667 is 2/3 approximately. So 13.5 * (2/3)=9. So 243 +9=252. So correct.

Wait another approach: Maybe the floor area is miscalculated. Let me compute 13.5 * 18.6667 precisely.

13.5 *18 = 243.

13.5 *0.6667: Let's compute 13 *0.6667=8.6661, and 0.5 *0.6667≈0.33335.

So 8.6661 +0.33335≈9.0.

So total is 243 +9=252. Correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. My calculation gives $43.68, but the options don't have that. Unless I made a mistake in the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says the price is 9 3/4 cent per 9" tile. Oh wait, is it per tile or per square foot?

Wait, 9 3/4 cents per tile. So each tile costs 9.75 cents. So 448 tiles would be 448 *0.0975=43.68.

So the exact amount is $43.68, but the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial area was wrong. Let me compute 162 inches * 224 inches again.

162 * 224: Let's do it step by step.

224 * 160 = 35,840.

224 *2 =448.

So 35,840 +448=36,288. So correct.

Wait, is 36,288 divided by 81 equal to 448?

Yes, because 81*448=36,288.

So I think the calculation is correct. So perhaps the intended answer is G: $43.88, but that's 20 cents higher. Maybe there's a mistake in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the price was meant to be 9.75 dollars per tile? No, that would be way too expensive, and the options are around $40-50, which would require only 5 tiles, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I misread the price. The price is 9 3/4 cents per 9" tile. Yes, that's per tile.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses different units, like the tiles are 9 square feet each, but that's not possible because a 9" tile is much smaller.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the tiles are 9 inches on each side, so 9x9 inches. So area is 81 sq inches, correct.

Wait, perhaps the price is per square foot, but no, it's per tile.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate how much per square foot and then multiply by the floor area.

Each tile is 0.5625 sq ft, and costs $0.0975. So per square foot, the cost is 0.0975 /0.5625 ≈0.17333 dollars per sq ft.

Multiply by floor area 252 sq ft: 252 *0.17333≈43.68, same as before.

Hmm. So the correct cost is $43.68, but the options don't have this. The closest is G: $43.88, which is 20 cents higher. Another possibility is that the options have a typo or rounding. Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the tile count.

Wait, maybe the floor area is 13'6" by 18'8" which is 162" x 224", but wait, 18'8" is 18*12 +8=226 inches? Wait wait wait, no, 18*12 is 216 plus 8 is 224. Oh, no, that's correct. So 224 inches.

Wait, perhaps when converting 18'8" to inches, I made a mistake. 18' is 18*12=216. Adding 8 gives 224, correct.

Wait another approach: Maybe the problem is that the tiles are sold in packs, and you can't buy individual tiles, so perhaps you have to round up to the next pack. But the problem doesn't mention anything about packs, so I think that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the price is per dozen tiles or something, but the problem states per tile.

Wait, perhaps the price is per square yard? No, the problem says per tile, so that's not it.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. My calculation leads me to $43.68, but that's not one of the options. The closest is G: $43.88. Maybe the intended answer is G, but I'm not sure why there's a discrepancy.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me re-calculate 448 * 9.75 cents.

448 *9=4032 cents.

448 *0.75=336 cents.

Total=4032+336=4368 cents.

4368 cents is $43.68.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer in dollars and cents with proper rounding. So 43.68 is $43.68, but maybe the options round to the nearest cent, but that doesn't change it. Alternatively, perhaps the options are in whole dollars, but that's not the case here.

Wait, looking at the options, G is $43.88, which is 20 cents more than my calculation. Maybe I should check if I have an error in the number of tiles.

Wait, another way: 162 inches is 13.5 feet, 224 inches is 18.6667 feet.

Total area in square feet: 13.5 * 18.6667 =252 sq ft.

Each tile covers 0.5625 sq ft. So 252 /0.5625=448 tiles.

Cost per tile: $0.0975.

Total cost: 448 *0.0975=43.68.

Wait, perhaps the answer should be $43.68, but it's not listed. So maybe the intended answer is G: $43.88 due to some miscalculation elsewhere, like a different tile size or price.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses mixed numbers incorrectly. Let me re-express 9 3/4 as a decimal correctly. 3/4 is 0.75, so 9.75 cents, correct.

Hmm. I think I've done everything correctly. Perhaps the intended answer is G, $43.88, but I'm not seeing where the 20 cents comes from. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the area calculation.

Wait, let me compute 162 *224
