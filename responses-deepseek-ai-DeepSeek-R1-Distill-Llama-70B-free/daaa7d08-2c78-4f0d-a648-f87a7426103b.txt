Question:

Which of the following executive orders will most likely be found unconstitutional?

Options:

A: The President issued an executive order instructing all executive branch employees to refrain from using social media during working hours.
B: The President issued an executive order banning all forms of meat consumption within the premises of the executive building, citing health reasons and environmental concerns.
C: The President issued an executive order abolishing a federal agency that was established by an Act of Congress, citing redundancy and inefficiency.
D: In 1887, Congress passed a law establishing a federal Commission of Birdwatchers. The Commission, which is still in effect, consists of seven members who are appointed by the President. The Commission's main function is to go on periodic retreats to photograph and study North American birds and their migratory habits. Believing that the Commission is archaic, the President decides that any future funding will simply be a waste of money. He thus executes an executive decree abrogating the Commission of Birdwatchers.
E: Without seeking the advice and consent of the Senate, the President issued an executive order to establish a new federal agency to oversee the operations of all other federal agencies.
F: The President issued an executive order requiring all executive branch employees to use exclusively one brand of ballpoint pens and pencils as their writing utensils. According to a study, the federal government could save in excess of $250,000 a year in office supply costs if all executive agencies were to use standardized pens and pencils.
G: The President issued an executive order declaring a state of emergency in a city dealing with civil unrest, and authorizes the use of military force without the approval of Congress.
H: The President issued an executive order mandating all executive branch employees to take a mandatory vacation for a period of one month.
I: The President issued an executive order requiring all executive branch employees to wear only white shirts and blouses during regular working hours. According to the President's directive, executive employees are prohibited from wearing colored (e. g. , blue or yellow) or striped shirts and blouses while on duty. The President issued the order in an effort to establish a uniform dress code for all executive employees.
J: A devastating hurricane damages an island which is part of a foreign country. The storm destroys many homes, resulting in death and injury to thousands. In response to a request from the foreign government for emergency aid, the President, without seeking the advice and consent of the Senate, issues an executive decree authorizing U. S. Army troops to the island to provide medical and humanitarian assistance.

Okay, so I have this multiple choice question about executive orders and their constitutionality. Hmm, I need to figure out which of these options is most likely unconstitutional. Let me think through each option one by one.

Starting with option A: The President orders executive branch employees not to use social media during work hours. That seems within their authority because the President is the head of the executive branch and can manage the workplace. So probably A is constitutional.

Option B: Banning meat consumption in the executive building. The President has authority over federal property, so setting dietary rules in the building might be okay, especially if it's for health and environment. B doesn't seem to cross any lines, so it's probably constitutional.

Option C: Abolishing a federal agency created by Congress. Wait, I remember that Congress creates agencies, and the President can't unilaterally abolish them. There's something about the legislative vesting clause. So C is likely unconstitutional because the President doesn't have that authority without Congressional approval.

Option D: The President abrogates a commission established by Congress. The commission was set up by an act, so again, the President can't just abolish it. Congress would need to repeal it. So D is also unconstitutional, similar to C.

Option E: Creating a new federal agency without Senate consent. The President usually needs Senate advice and consent for appointments, but creating an agency? Wait, no, the President can create agencies through executive orders as long as Congress funds them. Or is it that Congress must establish agencies? I'm a bit fuzzy here. Maybe E is unconstitutional if it's a new agency without Congressional approval, but I'm not certain.

Option F: Mandating a specific brand of pens and pencils. This seems like a procurement decision. The President can set standards for efficiency, so F is probably okay.

Option G: Declaring emergency and using military force without Congress. The President does have some emergency powers, but using military force without Congressional approval might violate the War Powers Resolution. However, the question is about constitutionality, not statute. The Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war, but the President can deploy troops in emergencies. I'm not sure if this is unconstitutional or just a violation of a statute. But in terms of the Constitution, maybe G is problematic.

Option H: Mandatory vacation for a month. That could interfere with employees' work and rights. But the President manages the executive branch, so perhaps it's within their discretion. Or maybe it's an overreach. Not sure, but it might be a gray area.

Option I: Dress code requiring white shirts. The President can set workplace policies, so this seems permissible. I doesn't seem unconstitutional.

Option J: Sending troops without Senate approval. This is about humanitarian aid, not war. The President can deploy troops for emergency assistance abroad under their authority as commander-in-chief, especially if it's temporary and humanitarian. So J is likely constitutional.

Now, back to the main question. The options that stand out as unconstitutional are C and D, because they involve abolishing agencies/commissions created by Congress. E might also be an issue if the President is creating a new agency without Congress.

Wait, in the case of agencies, the President can create advisory committees via executive order, but if it's a federal agency with regulatory powers, Congress needs to establish it. So option E says the President is creating a new federal agency without Senate consent. That might be unconstitutional because Congress has the authority to create agencies through legislation. So E could be unconstitutional as well.

So between C, D, and E. The question is which is most likely unconstitutional.

Looking back, in the case of the Supreme Court case Buckley v. Valeo, it dealt with appointments, but other cases might touch on agency creation. The President can't create an agency on their own without Congressional authority. So E would be unconstitutional.

Wait, but the question is about which is "most likely" unconstitutional. So perhaps E is more clearly unconstitutional because creating a new agency without Congress is a bigger overreach than abolishing an agency, which might involve different separation of powers issues.

Alternatively, the abolition of an agency (C and D) is definitely unconstitutional because Congress establishes agencies, and the President can't abolish them unilaterally. The Constitution gives Congress the authority to create and fund agencies, so the President can't just get rid of them. Therefore, options C and D are unconstitutional.

Looking at the options, the question asks which is most likely to be found unconstitutional. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but I have to choose the best option.

Wait, in option D, the President is abrogating a commission via executive decree. Since Congress created it, the President can't abolish it without Congress. So D is unconstitutional. Similarly, C is about abolishing an agency. So both C and D are likely unconstitutional.

But which one is the answer? The question gives options A-J, and I need to pick one.

Wait, the options are A to J, each a separate scenario. The question is which one is most likely unconstitutional.

So among the options, C and D are about abolishing agencies. The President can't do that without Congress. So both C and D are unconstitutional. But the options are separate, so which one is the answer?

Wait, the question is phrased as "which of the following executive orders will most likely be found unconstitutional?"

Only one correct answer. I need to pick the most problematic one.

Option E is about creating a new agency without Senate consent. Wait, the Senate's advice and consent is about appointments, not about creating agencies. Creating agencies is a legislative function. So the President can't create a new federal agency on their own; that's for Congress to do through legislation. Therefore, E is unconstitutional because it's creating a new agency without Congress.

Alternatively, maybe the President can create agencies through executive orders if they're within existing appropriations. I'm a bit confused on that point.

In the case of the Department of Homeland Security, it was created by Congress. But perhaps the President can create smaller agencies or reorganize existing ones under certain conditions. Like, there's the Reorganization Act which allows some reorganization with Congressional approval after a period.

So if the President is creating a new federal agency without any Congressional involvement, that would be unconstitutional because it's an exercise of legislative power.

Thus, option E is unconstitutional.

Similarly, options C and D involve abolishing agencies, which is also unconstitutional.

So I have to choose between C, D, and E.

The question is which is "most likely" to be found unconstitutional.

Between C and E, which is a bigger issue? Creating an agency without Congress is a direct violation of Congress's legislative power. Abolishing an agency is also a violation.

Hmm. Another angle: the President can't create an agency because that's a legislative function, but they can't abolish agencies because that's up to Congress as well.

In the case of Bowsher v. Synar, the Court held that Congress can't remove an officer without violating separation of powers, but that's about removal, not agencies.

Wait, another case: In the 1930s, President Franklin Roosevelt tried to reorganize executive agencies, but the Supreme Court struck down some of his actions in cases like the Humphrey's Executor case, which dealt with removal of FTC commissioners, not creation or abolition.

In terms of creating agencies, the key is that Congress must establish them. So option E, creating a federal agency without Senate consent (and without Congress's establishment) is unconstitutional. So E is a clear violation.

Similarly, options C and D involve abolishing agencies, which is also unconstitutional. So all three (C, D, E) are problematic.

But the question is which is most likely unconstitutional. Since creating a new agency without Congress is a direct overreach, E stands out.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify whether Congress has appropriated funds. The President can't spend money without appropriation, but creating an agency would require funding, which is another issue. But the question is about the executive order itself, not funding.

So, putting it all together, the likely unconstitutional options are C, D, and E. But the question gives us one correct answer. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at the answer choices, I think the correct answer is E because creating a new federal agency without Congressional approval is a clear overstep of authority. Alternatively, option C and D are also problematic.

Wait, another thought: the President can create advisory boards or committees through executive orders, but not agencies with regulatory authority. So if the new agency in E is an oversight agency, that might require Congressional establishment.

So I think E is unconstitutional.

Wait, but looking back, in the past, the President has created agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency through reorganization plans, but that requires some form of Congressional involvement, like a reorganization act. So without that, creating a new agency is unconstitutional.

So the answer is E.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because option C says the President abolished an agency established by Congress. That's definitely unconstitutional because Congress must abolish it. So C is a clear violation.

Similarly, D is about abrogating a commission established by Congress, which is also unconstitutional.

So the options C and D are both unconstitutional. But the question is which is the most likely to be found unconstitutional.

So the answer could be C, D, or E.

Hmm. Let me think about each one.

Option C: The President abolishes a federal agency created by Congress. That's a clear violation because only Congress can abolish such an agency. So C is unconstitutional.

Option D: Similar to C, but it's a Commission. Same reasoning applies; D is unconstitutional.

Option E: Creating a new agency without Congress. Also unconstitutional.

So the possible answers are C, D, E.

But the question is which one is most likely. Let me think which one is more directly a violation.

Creating a new agency without Congress is a bigger deal because it's a new entity, whereas abolishing is taking down an existing one. But both are problematic.

Alternatively, perhaps option C is the correct answer because the Supreme Court has held that the President cannot abolish an agency created by Congress without Congressional consent.

In the case of Buckley v. Valeo, the Court struck down the line-item veto because Congress can't give the President unilateral power to rescind spending, but that's different.

Wait, but in the case of the Independent Counsel statute, the Court upheld it, but that was about appointments, not agencies.

Hmm. Maybe the key is that the President can't create or abolish agencies without Congress.

So all three options (C, D, E) are problematic, but the question asks which is most likely to be unconstitutional.

Wait, the correct answer is probably option C because it's about abolishing an agency, which is a clear overreach. Similarly, D is the same.

But looking at the options given, perhaps the answer is C.

But I'm a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E because creating a new agency is a more direct violation of Congress's legislative power.

Wait, the President can create an agency through executive order if it's within the existing appropriations and not requiring new funding. But if it's a new agency with its own powers, then it's unconstitutional.

So, considering all, option E is creating a new federal agency to oversee all other agencies. That sounds like a significant restructuring that would require Congressional approval. Therefore, E is unconstitutional.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another approach is to think about what the other options involve.

Option G: Declaring an emergency and using military force without Congress. The President has some authority under the Constitution as commander-in-chief, but deploying military without Congress could be seen as violating the War Powers Act, but not necessarily unconstitutional. So G might not be the best choice.

Option H: Mandatory vacation. That might be an overreach of presidential authority over employees, but perhaps it's within their management powers. So H is less likely to be unconstitutional.

Option I: Dress code. That's a workplace rule, so probably okay.

Option J: Humanitarian aid without Senate. That's acceptable under the President's authority in emergencies.

So, going back, the most likely unconstitutional options are C, D, and E.

But the question is which one is the answer. I'll have to decide between them.

I think the answer is C because the President cannot abolish an agency created by Congress. Similarly, D is the same situation.

But the options are separate, so perhaps the answer is C or D.

Wait, the question asks which is most likely to be found unconstitutional. So perhaps option C is the best choice because it directly involves abolishing an agency, which is a clear legislative function.

Alternatively, the answer might be E.

I'm a bit torn, but I think the correct answer is E. Wait, no, because creating an agency is more of a legislative act, but the President can create agencies under certain conditions. Maybe not.

Alternatively, the correct answer is C.

Wait, I think I've spent too much time on this, but I'll go with option C as the answer.

To determine which executive order is most likely to be found unconstitutional, each option must be analyzed in light of constitutional principles and separation of powers.

- **Option A**: The President can manage the executive branch, including setting workplace rules like restricting social media use. This is constitutional.  
- **Option B**: The President has authority over federal property, so banning meat consumption in the executive building for health and environmental reasons is likely constitutional.  
- **Option C**: The President cannot unilaterally abolish a federal agency established by Congress, as this violates the legislative branch's authority to create such entities. This is unconstitutional.  
- **Option D**: Similar to C, the President cannot abrogate a commission created by Congress without Congressional approval. This is also unconstitutional.  
- **Option E**: Creating a new federal agency without Congressional approval directly violates the legislative branch's authority to establish agencies. This is unconstitutional.  
- **Option F**: Mandating a specific brand of office supplies is a procurement decision within the President's authority. This is constitutional.  
- **Option G**: Declaring an emergency and deploying military force without Congress may violate the War Powers Resolution, but it is not necessarily unconstitutional under the President's emergency powers.  
- **Option H**: Requiring mandatory vacations could be seen as an overreach, but it may fall within the President's discretion to manage the executive branch.  
- **Option I**: Setting a dress code for employees is a workplace policy within the President's authority. This is constitutional.  
- **Option J**: Providing humanitarian aid abroad, even without Senate approval, is within the President's authority as commander-in-chief. This is constitutional.  

The most problematic options are **C**, **D**, and **E**, as they involve the President overstepping their authority by abolishing or creating agencies without Congressional approval. However, **E** stands out because creating a new federal agency is a direct violation of Congress's legislative power, making it the most likely to be found unconstitutional.

ANSWER: E
