Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about tire pressure and temperature changes. Hmm, I remember that pressure and temperature are related in gases. Oh right, it's probably the ideal gas law. But wait, the volume is constant here, so maybe I can use a simpler version of the law.

The problem says the tire was inflated to 24 lb per square inch on a winter day at -5°C. Then, on a summer day at 35°C, what's the pressure? No leaks and volume is constant, so n (moles) and V are the same. So it's a case of pressure and temperature changing, with n and V fixed.

Right, the combined gas law would be useful here. The formula is P1/T1 = P2/T2 when volume and moles are constant. Oh wait, but wait—temperature has to be in Kelvin for this, right? Because Kelvin is an absolute scale.

So I need to convert both temperatures to Kelvin. Let's see, the winter temperature is -5°C. To convert to Kelvin, add 273.15. So -5 + 273.15 is 268.15 K. And the summer temperature is 35°C, which is 35 + 273.15 = 308.15 K.

Now, plug into the formula. P1 is 24 lb/in². T1 is 268.15 K. P2 is what we're looking for, T2 is 308.15 K.

So P2 = P1 * (T2 / T1). Let me calculate that. 

T2/T1 is 308.15 / 268.15. Let me compute that. Hmm, 308 divided by 268 is approximately 1.149. More accurately, let me do the division: 308.15 ÷ 268.15. Let's see, 268 × 1 is 268, 268 × 1.1 is 294.8, 268 × 1.14 is about 305.92 (since 0.14 *268 = 37.52; 268 +37.52=305.52), which is close to 308.15. So 308.15 - 305.52 is 2.63. So 2.63 /268.15 is about 0.0098. So the ratio T2/T1 is approximately 1.14 + 0.0098 = 1.1498, roughly 1.15.

So P2 = 24 lb * 1.15. Let's compute that. 24 * 1 =24, 24 *0.15=3.6, so 24+3.6=27.6 lb/in².

Wait, looking at the options: let me see. The options are A:35, B:32, C:26, D:30, E:28, F:29, G:27, H:31, I:33, J:34.

Hmm, 27.6 is closest to 28, which is option E. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes rounding can affect the result.

Let me calculate 308.15 /268.15 more accurately. Let's do the division:

Compute 308.15 divided by 268.15.

Well, 268.15 * 1 =268.15 → subtract from 308.15: 40.

Bring down a decimal: 268.15 goes into 400 about 1.5 times (since 268 *1.5 is 402, which is a bit over). Let me see: 268.15 × 1.14 = ?

1.14 is 1 + 0.14. So 268.15 ×1=268.15, 268.15 ×0.14 = ?

0.1 × 268.15 is 26.815, 0.04 ×268.15 is 10.726. So 26.815 +10.726=37.541. So 268.15 +37.541=305.691. So 1.14 times 268.15 is 305.691. 

The actual T2 is 308.15, so the difference is 308.15 -305.691=2.459.

So 2.459 /268.15 is approximately 0.00917. So the exact ratio is 1.14 +0.00917 =1.14917.

So P2=24 *1.14917 ≈ let's calculate that.

24 *1 =24. 24 *0.14917. Let's see: 0.1*24=2.4, 0.04*24=0.96, 0.00917*24=0.220. So 2.4 +0.96=3.36, plus 0.220 is 3.58. So total is 24 +3.58=27.58 lb/in².

So approximately 27.58, which is about 27.6 lb/in². Looking at the options, the closest is option G:27 or E:28. Wait, E is 28. Oh, but 27.58 is closer to 28 than 27, because 27.5 would be the midpoint. So 27.58 is just above 27.5, so would round up to 28.

Wait, but some might consider significant figures. The initial pressure is given as 24, which has two sig figs. The temperatures are -5 and 35, both given as whole numbers, so two sig figs each. So the final result should have two sig figs. So 27.58 would round to 28, which is option E.

But wait, let me check the options again. Option G is 27, E is 28. So the correct answer is E.

Wait, but wait another thing—pressure is 24 lb/in², which is given as 24, which is two sig figs. So the calculation's result should be two sig figs. So 27.6 would round to 28, yes.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to use the conversion factor between psi and atm for pressure. Oh wait, the question gives 1.00 atm =14.7 lb/in². So perhaps we need to use absolute pressure in atm, but wait, no, because the pressure given is 24 lb/in², and we can directly apply the pressure-temperature relationship in the same units.

Wait, but wait another thing—since the volume is constant, and the amount of gas is the same, the ratio P1/T1 = P2/T2 holds. But the temperatures must be in Kelvin. So the approach I took earlier is correct.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute the initial pressure in atm. 24 lb/in² divided by 14.7 lb/in²/atm. So 24 /14.7 is approximately 1.63 atm. Then, with the temperature change, compute the new pressure in atm, then convert back to lb/in².

Let's try that.

Initial pressure P1 =24 psi. Since 1 atm=14.7 psi, P1 in atm is 24 /14.7 ≈1.63299 atm.

T1 is -5°C =268.15 K. T2 is 35°C=308.15 K.

So P2 = P1 * (T2/T1) =1.63299 atm * (308.15/268.15) ≈1.63299 * 1.14917 ≈1.63299 *1.14917.

Let me calculate 1.633 *1.1492.

1.633 *1 =1.633.

1.633 *0.1 =0.1633.

1.633 *0.04=0.06532.

1.633 *0.0092≈0.0150.

Adding all: 1.633 +0.1633=1.7963; +0.06532=1.8616; +0.015=1.8766 atm.

So P2 ≈1.8766 atm. Now convert back to psi: 1.8766 atm *14.7 psi/atm = ?

1.8766 *14.7. Let me compute that.

1 *14.7=14.7.

0.8 *14.7=11.76.

0.07 *14.7=1.029.

0.0066 *14.7≈0.097.

Adding: 14.7 +11.76=26.46; +1.029=27.489; +0.097≈27.586 psi.

So again, about 27.586 psi, which would round to 28 psi, option E.

Wait, but earlier I thought the options had G as 27 and E as 28. So this confirms that 27.58 is approximately 28, so E.

But wait, the initial approach and the second approach both give the same result, around 27.58, which is about 28. So the correct answer is E.

Looking back at the options, option E is 28 lb/in².

To solve the problem, we use the relationship between pressure and temperature when the volume and amount of gas are constant, which is given by the combined gas law:

\[
\frac{P_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2}{T_2}
\]

### Step 1: Convert temperatures to Kelvin
The winter temperature is \(-5^\circ \mathrm{C}\), which converts to:
\[
T_1 = -5 + 273.15 = 268.15 \, \mathrm{K}
\]

The summer temperature is \(35^\circ \mathrm{C}\), which converts to:
\[
T_2 = 35 + 273.15 = 308.15 \, \mathrm{K}
\]

### Step 2: Apply the combined gas law
Rearranging the formula to solve for \(P_2\):
\[
P_2 = P_1 \cdot \frac{T_2}{T_1}
\]

Substitute the known values:
\[
P_2 = 24 \, \mathrm{lb/in^2} \cdot \frac{308.15 \, \mathrm{K}}{268.15 \, \mathrm{K}}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the temperature ratio
\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \frac{308.15}{268.15} \approx 1.149
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the final pressure
\[
P_2 = 24 \cdot 1.149 \approx 27.58 \, \mathrm{lb/in^2}
\]

### Step 5: Round the result
Since the given data has two significant figures, the final pressure is rounded to:
\[
P_2 \approx 28 \, \mathrm{lb/in^2}
\]

### Final Answer
The pressure on the summer day is approximately \(28 \, \mathrm{lb/in^2}\), which corresponds to **option E**.
