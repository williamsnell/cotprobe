Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

A skier who weighs 90 kg starts from rest and goes down a hill inclined at 17 degrees. He skis 100 meters down the hill, then coasts for another 70 meters on level snow until he stops. I need to find the coefficient of kinetic friction between his skis and the snow. The options are from A to J, and I have to choose the correct one.

Hmm, right. So I remember that when objects move with friction, some of their kinetic energy is lost as heat due to friction. I think I can approach this problem using the conservation of energy, considering both the downhill and the level parts of the skier's motion.

Let me break it down into two parts: the downhill motion and the motion on the level snow.

First, the skier starts from rest, so his initial velocity is zero. He slides down a 100-meter incline. At the bottom of the hill, he'll have some kinetic energy, which will then be used to propel him 70 meters on level ground until he stops. So, the kinetic energy at the bottom of the hill is what allows him to move that 70 meters on flat snow, but friction is acting against him the whole time, both downhill and on the flat.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, when he's going down the hill, there's also friction acting on him. So both the downhill and the level parts involve work done by friction.

I think the correct approach is to compute the total mechanical energy at the top, then the mechanical energy at the bottom of the hill, and then the mechanical energy after moving on the flat until stopping.

Wait, but since the skier starts from rest, the initial kinetic energy is zero. The potential energy at the top is mgh, where h is the height of the hill. At the bottom of the hill, he has kinetic energy plus a loss due to friction on the hill. Then, as he moves on the flat, he loses all of that kinetic energy due to friction on the flat snow, which does work against his motion until he stops.

Alternatively, maybe I should model the entire motion as two steps: first, going down the hill, and second, moving on the flat until stopping.

Let me think about energies. The total mechanical energy (potential + kinetic) at the top is mgh. At the bottom of the hill, the potential energy is lower, and he has kinetic energy, but some energy was lost as heat due to friction on the hill. Then, on the flat, he loses all his kinetic energy as heat due to friction on the flat.

Wait, but the question is about the coefficient of kinetic friction. I think the friction force is the same in both the downhill and the flat parts because it's the same skis and snow. So the coefficient of kinetic friction is the same in both cases.

So, perhaps the approach is to compute the total loss of mechanical energy due to friction during the downhill, equate that to the work done by friction on the hill, then do the same for the flat part, and combine them.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to formalize it.

At the top of the hill:

Potential energy = mgh, where h is the height difference. Kinetic energy is zero because he starts from rest.

At the bottom of the hill:

Potential energy is lower, and he has kinetic energy K. The work done by friction on the hill is the force of friction multiplied by the distance (100 m).

Then, on the flat, he uses that kinetic energy K to move 70 m, but friction does work against him, bringing him to a stop.

So, perhaps I can compute the total mechanical energy at the top, subtract the work done by friction on the hill, and that gives the kinetic energy at the bottom. Then, that kinetic energy is equal to the work done by friction on the flat.

Wait, no, because when he goes down the hill, the loss is due to both the gravitational force's component along the slope and the work done by friction.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the entire process from the top of the hill to the point where he stops. The total mechanical energy at the top is mgh, and at the end, it's zero because he comes to rest. The work done by friction is the sum of the work done on the hill and on the flat.

Yes, that makes sense. So the total mechanical energy at the top, mgh, is converted into heat via friction over the total distance (100m downhill +70m flat). Because when he stops, all that energy has been lost as heat.

Wait, no. Wait, the work done by friction during the downhill is friction force multiplied by 100m. Then, on the flat, the friction force is the same, multiplied by 70m. So the total work done by friction is (f_k * 100) + (f_k *70) ), where f_k is the kinetic friction force.

So the total work done by friction is f_k (100 +70) )= 170 f_k.

And the initial mechanical energy is m g h, which is equal to the total work done by friction, because in the end, he stops (so kinetic energy is zero).

Wait, but wait. The potential energy at the top is m g h, and that's converted into kinetic energy at the bottom, but some is lost as heat on the way down. Then, the kinetic energy at the bottom is converted into heat on the flat snow. So the sum of the heat from the downhill and the flat is equal to m g h.

So, m g h = Work_friction_downhill + Work_friction_flat.

Work_friction_downhill is f_k * d_down = f_k *100.

Work_friction_flat is f_k *d_flat = f_k *70.

So m g h = f_k (100 +70) ) = 170 f_k.

Then, f_k = (m g h) / 170.

But wait, what's h? The height of the hill. The hill is inclined at 17 degrees, and the length of the downhill is 100 m. So h = 100 * sin(17 degrees).

So, h = 100 * sin(17°). Let me compute that. I'll need to calculate sin(17°), but I think I can proceed symbolically for now.

So h = 100 * sin(17°).

Plugging that back in:

f_k = (m * g * 100 * sin(17°)) / 170.

Simplify: f_k = (m g * 100 sin17) / 170.

But m is 90 kg, g is 9.8 m/s².

So f_k = (90 *9.8 * 100 * sin17) / 170.

Wait, but wait, the coefficient of kinetic friction μ_k is equal to f_k divided by the normal force N.

What's the normal force in each case?

On the incline: The normal force N1 is m g cos(theta), where theta is 17 degrees. Because on the incline, the component of the weight perpendicular to the slope is m g cos(theta).

On the flat: The normal force N2 is m g, because it's supporting the entire weight.

But the friction force on the incline is μ_k * N1, which is μ_k m g cos(theta).

The friction force on the flat is μ_k * N2, which is μ_k m g.

Wait, but earlier I assumed that the friction force f_k is the same in both cases. But that's not true. Because the normal forces are different, so the friction forces are different.

Oh wait, I made a mistake earlier. The friction force is different on the hill and on the flat because the normal forces are different.

So I can't treat f_k as a constant in both cases. That complicates things.

So I need to model the two parts separately.

Let me think again.

First, on the downhill slope:

The skier's potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, but some is lost to friction on the slope.

Then, on the flat, the kinetic energy is lost due to friction until he stops.

So perhaps I should consider the downhill and flat parts as two separate steps.

Let me model each step.

Step 1: Down the hill.

Initial state: at rest, height h above the bottom.

Final state: at the bottom of the hill, with some kinetic energy.

Energy at the top: m g h (potential) + 0 (kinetic) = m g h.

Energy at the bottom: 0 (potential) + (1/2) m v^2 (kinetic) + heat lost on the hill, which is work done by friction on the hill: f_k_hill * d_down.

So m g h = (1/2) m v^2 + f_k_hill * 100.

But f_k_hill is μ_k * N_hill, and N_hill is m g cos(theta). So f_k_hill = μ_k m g cos(theta).

So the equation becomes: m g h = (1/2) m v^2 + μ_k m g cos(theta) *100.

Simplify: g h = (v²)/2 + μ_k g cos(theta) *100.

Divide both sides by g:

h = (v²)/(2g) + μ_k cos(theta) *100.

Ok, that's the first equation.

Step 2: Moving on the flat.

He starts with kinetic energy (1/2 m v^2) and comes to rest after moving 70 m. The work done by friction on the flat is f_k_flat *70.

f_k_flat is μ_k * N_flat. N_flat is m g, so f_k_flat= μ_k m g.

The work done by friction is μ_k m g *70.

So the kinetic energy at the bottom of the hill is lost as heat on the flat:

(1/2 m v^2) = μ_k m g *70.

Simplify: (v²)/2 = μ_k g *70.

So from the flat part, we can solve for v²:

v² = 2 * μ_k g *70 = 140 μ_k g.

Now, substitute v² into the equation from the hill.

From the hill equation:

h = (v²)/(2g) + μ_k cos(theta) *100.

Substituting v² from the flat: v² =140 μ_k g.

So:

h = (140 μ_k g) / (2 g) ) + μ_k cos(theta) *100.

Simplify:

h = (70 μ_k) + 100 μ_k cos(theta).

Factor out μ_k:

h = μ_k (70 + 100 cos(theta)).

Now, solve for μ_k:

μ_k = h / (70 + 100 cos(theta)).

But h is the height of the hill, which is 100 m * sin(theta), since the length of the incline is 100 m and h = 100 sin(theta).

So h = 100 sin(theta).

Substitute:

μ_k = [100 sin(theta)] / (70 + 100 cos(theta)).

Now plug in theta =17 degrees.

Let me compute the values numerically.

Compute sin(17°) and cos(17°):

sin(17) ≈ 0.29237.

cos(17) ≈ 0.95630.

So:

Numerator: 100 * 0.29237 ≈ 29.237.

Denominator:70 + 100 * 0.95630 = 70 + 95.630 ≈ 165.630.

So μ_k ≈ 29.237 / 165.630 ≈ ?

Let me compute that. 29.237 ÷ 165.63 ≈ 0.1764.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 100 sin(17) is 29.237.

Denominator is 70 + 100 * cos(17)=70 +95.63=165.63.

So 29.237 / 165.63 ≈ 0.1764.

Hmm, looking at the options, 0.18 is option J, 0.15 is I, 0.20 is A. Wait, 0.176 is approximately 0.18, but looking at the options, perhaps it's one of the given choices.

Alternatively, let me recheck my steps for any possible errors.

Wait, in the flat part, the kinetic energy (1/2 m v²) equals the work done by friction, which is μ_k m g *70. So that gives (v²)/2 = μ_k g *70.

Yes, that seems correct.

In the hill part, the potential energy m g h is converted into kinetic energy (1/2 m v²) plus the work done by friction on the hill, which is μ_k m g cos(theta) *100.

So that's correct.

Then, substituting v² from the flat into the hill equation gives h = (v²)/(2g) + μ_k 100 cos(theta).

Wait, but when I substituted v²=140 μ_k g, I get (140 μ_k g )/(2g )=70 μ_k.

So that becomes 70 μ_k + 100 μ_k cos(theta) = h.

But h is 100 sin(theta), so:

70 μ_k +100 μ_k cos(theta) =100 sin(theta).

Factor μ_k: μ_k (70 +100 cos(theta)) =100 sin(theta).

So μ_k = [100 sin(theta)] / [70 +100 cos(theta)].

Which is what I had earlier.

So plugging in the numbers:

[100 * 0.29237] / [70 +100 * 0.9563] = 29.237 / (70 +95.63) = 29.237 / 165.63 ≈ 0.1764.

So approximately 0.176, which is about 0.18. So looking at the options, J is 0.18. So the answer would be J.

Wait, but wait, let me check the calculation again because 0.176 is closer to 0.18, but maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that when the skier is on the flat, the work done by friction is μ_k m g *70, which equals the kinetic energy at the bottom of the hill.

Wait, but that's exactly what I did. So I think the approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra somewhere.

Wait, let me re-express the equations.

From the flat:

(1/2) m v^2 = μ_k m g *70.

Cancel m: (1/2) v^2 = μ_k g *70 → v^2 = 140 μ_k g.

From the hill:

m g h = (1/2) m v^2 + μ_k m g cos(theta) *100.

Divide both sides by m:

g h = (v²)/2 + μ_k g cos(theta) *100.

Divide both sides by g:

h = (v²)/(2g) + μ_k cos(theta) *100.

Substitute v²=140 μ_k g:

h = (140 μ_k g) / (2g) ) + μ_k 100 cos(theta).

Simplify: 70 μ_k + 100 μ_k cos(theta) = h.

But h=100 sin(theta).

So:

70 μ_k +100 μ_k cos(theta) =100 sin(theta).

Factor μ_k:

μ_k (70 +100 cos(theta)) =100 sin(theta).

Thus:

μ_k= [100 sin(theta)] / [70 +100 cos(theta)].

Yes, that's correct.

So plugging in the numbers:

sin(17)= approx 0.2924; cos(17)= approx 0.9563.

So numerator: 100 *0.2924=29.24.

Denominator:70 +100*(0.9563)=70+95.63=165.63.

So 29.24/165.63 ≈ 0.1764.

Which is approximately 0.176, which is around 0.18, so option J.

But wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute more accurate values.

Let me get more precise values for sin(17°) and cos(17°).

Using a calculator:

sin(17°) ≈ 0.2923717.

cos(17°) ≈ 0.9563048.

So numerator: 100 * 0.2923717 = 29.23717.

Denominator:70 +100 *0.9563048 =70 +95.63048 = 165.63048.

So μ_k=29.23717 / 165.63048 = ?

Let me compute this division.

29.23717 ÷165.63048.

Let me do this step by step.

165.63048 goes into 29.23717 how many times?

Well, 165 *0.176 is 165 *0.1=16.5, 165*0.07=11.55, 165*0.006=0.99. So 16.5+11.55=28.05, +0.99=29.04. So 0.176 gives 29.04, which is close to 29.23717.

So 0.176 *165.63048 = 29.04 (approximately).

The actual numerator is 29.23717, which is 0.19717 more than 29.04.

So the remaining part is 0.19717 /165.63048 ≈ 0.00119.

So total μ_k ≈0.176 +0.00119≈0.1772.

So about 0.1772, which is approximately 0.177, which is 0.18 when rounded to two decimal places.

But looking at the options, 0.18 is option J. So the answer should be J.

But wait, another thought: perhaps I should have considered the work done by friction as the same in both cases, but no, the approach seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should have considered the entire process as a single energy loss.

Wait, another approach: The total distance traveled is 170 m (100 downhill, 70 flat), but the normal forces are different, so the frictional forces are different.

So the total work done by friction is the sum of work on the hill and work on the flat.

Work on hill: f_k_hill *100 = μ_k m g cos(theta) *100.

Work on flat: f_k_flat *70 = μ_k m g *70.

Total work done by friction: μ_k m g (100 cos(theta) +70).

This total work equals the initial potential energy m g h.

So:

μ_k m g (100 cos(theta) +70) )= m g h.

Cancel m g from both sides:

μ_k (100 cos(theta) +70 )= h.

But h=100 sin(theta).

So:

μ_k = [100 sin(theta)] / [100 cos(theta) +70].

Which is the same expression as before.

So yes, same result, μ
