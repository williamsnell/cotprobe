Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question again. 

The problem says that a chemist is preparing chlorine gas using the reaction: MnO₂ + 4HCl → MnCl₂ + 2H₂O + Cl₂ ↑. They're using 100 grams of MnO₂, and we need to find the maximum volume of chlorine gas produced at STP. The options are from A to J, and I have to choose the correct one.

Hmm, right. So I remember that at STP, one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters. So whatever moles of Cl₂ we get will directly translate to volume divided by 22.4. 

First, I think I need to find out how many moles of MnO₂ are present. Because MnO₂ is the reactant here, and the reaction probably goes to completion if we have excess HCl. So the limiting reagent is MnO₂. 

Manganese(IV) oxide is MnO₂. The molar mass would be the atomic weight of Mn plus twice that of O. Manganese's atomic weight is about 54.94 g/mol, and oxygen is 16.00 g/mol each. So 54.94 + (2 * 16.00) = 54.94 +32 = 86.94 g/mol. 

Wait, the given mass is 100 grams. So moles of MnO₂ would be mass divided by molar mass. So 100g / 86.94 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 

100 / 86.94 is approximately 1.15 moles. Let me check that calculation. 86.94 times 1 is 86.94, times 1.15 is about 100 (since 0.15 *86 is around 13, so 86 +13=99, close enough). So about 1.15 moles.

Now, looking at the balanced equation: the reaction ratio is 1 mole of MnO₂ producing 1 mole of Cl₂. Because the equation is 1 MnO₂ → ... + 1 Cl₂. So the mole ratio is 1:1. 

So if we have 1.15 moles of MnO₂, that should produce 1.15 moles of Cl₂. 

Now, converting moles of Cl₂ to volume at STP. Since 1 mole is 22.4 liters, 1.15 moles would be 1.15 * 22.4 L. Let me compute that. 22.4 * 1 is 22.4, 22.4 * 0.15 is 3.36. So total would be 22.4 +3.36=25.76 liters. 

Looking at the options, let me see. Option G is 25.8 liters, which is very close to my calculation. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps. Did I miss anything? 

Molar mass calculation: Mn is 54.94, O is 16. So 54.94 +32=86.94. Correct. 100g /86.94 = approx 1.15. Correct. 

Reaction stoichiometry: 1 MnO2 gives 1 Cl2. So 1:1 ratio. So moles of Cl2 is same as moles of MnO2. So 1.15 *22.4=25.76, which is about 25.8. So yes, option G. 

I think that's solid. No mistakes in the steps. So the answer is G.

To determine the maximum volume of chlorine gas (Cl₂) that can be obtained at STP, we start by analyzing the reaction:

\[
\text{MnO}_2 + 4\text{HCl} \rightarrow \text{MnCl}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{Cl}_2 \uparrow
\]

### Step 1: Calculate moles of MnO₂
The molar mass of MnO₂ is calculated as:
\[
\text{Molar mass of MnO}_2 = \text{Atomic mass of Mn} + 2 \times \text{Atomic mass of O} = 54.94 + (2 \times 16.00) = 86.94 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]
Given 100 g of MnO₂, the number of moles is:
\[
\text{Moles of MnO}_2 = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar mass}} = \frac{100}{86.94} \approx 1.15 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 2: Use stoichiometry to find moles of Cl₂
From the balanced equation, 1 mole of MnO₂ produces 1 mole of Cl₂. Therefore, the moles of Cl₂ produced are:
\[
\text{Moles of Cl}_2 = 1.15 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 3: Convert moles of Cl₂ to volume at STP
At STP, 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters. Thus, the volume of Cl₂ is:
\[
\text{Volume of Cl}_2 = \text{Moles of Cl}_2 \times 22.4 \, \text{L/mol} = 1.15 \times 22.4 \approx 25.8 \, \text{L}.
\]

### Final Answer
The maximum volume of chlorine gas that can be obtained is approximately **25.8 liters**, which corresponds to option **G**.
