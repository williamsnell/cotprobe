Near the edge of the field, a woman was sitting in a beach chair and reading a book. The girl threw the ball too far, and it went over her friends' heads and flew toward the woman. Although the woman did not see the ball coming, it hit the straw hat that the woman was wearing, knocking it from her head. Although the woman was not touched by the ball, she was startled by the ball hitting her hat, and she fell from her chair and broke her arm. If the woman initiates a suit against the girl to recover damages for her broken arm, the woman will

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this tort law question. Let's see what the scenario is. There's a 12-year-old girl playing catch with her friends in a field. She throws the ball too far, and it goes over her friends and hits a woman's straw hat. The woman wasn't watching, so she didn't see the ball coming. The ball hits her hat, knocking it off, and she gets startled, falls, and breaks her arm. Now, she's suing the girl for damages. 

Hmm, so the question is about whether the woman can recover damages, and if so, under what legal theory. The options are about various torts like negligence, battery, assault, etc.

First, I need to recall the elements of different torts. Let's think about battery. Battery requires intentional harmful or offensive contact with another person. But here, the girl didn't throw the ball directly at the woman, right? She was playing catch, and the ball went too far. So was there an intent to hit the woman? I don't think so. The girl probably didn't intend for the ball to hit the woman. So maybe battery isn't the right claim here.

Wait, but battery can also be about intent to make contact, not necessarily intent to cause harm. But in this case, the girl didn't intend to hit anyone; she was just playing. So maybe battery doesn't apply.

What about negligence? Negligence involves a breach of duty, causation, and damages. The girl had a duty to play carefully. Throwing the ball too hard might be a breach. The ball hitting the hat led to the woman's fall, which caused the injury. So causation seems present, and there's clearly damage. So negligence could be a possible claim.

But wait, in some cases, if the injury is a result of an unforeseeable event, like the woman being startled and falling, does that break the chain of causation? I think the girl could have foreseen that throwing a ball in the direction of someone might cause them to be startled, even if she didn't intend it. So maybe the negligence holds.

Now, the options: looking at the choices, some mention negligence, others battery or assault. Option G says she'll recover for negligence only. Option J says both negligence and battery. But I thought battery might not apply because there's no intent. Unless, maybe, the act of throwing the ball in a way that it could hit someone constitutes intent. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another element for battery is that the contact must be harmful or offensive. Here, the ball hit the hat, not the woman's body, but it did knock the hat off, which caused her to be startled. So technically, the contact was with the hat, which is personal property, but not her person. So maybe that's not enough for battery because the contact wasn't directly with her body. Unless, under some theories, contact with something closely connected to the person (like clothing) counts as contact with the person. I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

If the contact with the hat is considered contact with the person, then maybe battery applies. But I'm not certain. If that's the case, then both negligence and battery could be possible. But I think more likely, battery wouldn't apply because the intent to hit the woman wasn't there. So the main claim would be negligence.

Looking at the options:

Option G: recover for negligence only.

Option J: both negligence and battery.

I'm leaning towards G because the girl was negligent in her throw, leading to the injury, but there's no intent for battery. But if the contact with the hat is considered a battery, then it's both. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the girl's action was negligent, but not an intentional tort. So the woman can only recover under negligence.

Wait, I also remember that for negligence, the plaintiff must show that the defendant owed a duty, breached it, and caused the injury. Here, all elements seem present. So the woman should recover under negligence.

Looking at the options, G says she'll recover for negligence only. So I think that's the correct answer.

The question revolves around whether the woman can recover damages from the girl for her broken arm and, if so, under which legal theory. The girl threw a baseball that accidentally hit the woman's hat, startling her and causing her to fall. The analysis focuses on the torts of battery and negligence.

Battery requires intentional harmful or offensive contact with another person. However, the girl did not intend to hit the woman; she was simply playing catch. The ball hit the hat, not the woman directly, and there is no clear intent to make contact with the woman. While some might argue that contact with the hat could be considered contact with the person, this is uncertain. Thus, battery is unlikely to apply.

Negligence, on the other hand, involves a breach of duty, causation, and damages. The girl had a duty to play carefully, and throwing the ball too far could constitute a breach of that duty. The ball hitting the hat and startling the woman led to her fall and injury, establishing causation and damages. Therefore, negligence is a valid claim.

Considering the options:

- **Option G**: Recover for negligence only. This aligns with the analysis, as the girl's actions were negligent but not intentional.
- **Option J**: Recover for both negligence and battery. This is less likely, as battery requires intent, which is absent here.

The most appropriate answer is that the woman will recover for negligence only.

Answer: G
