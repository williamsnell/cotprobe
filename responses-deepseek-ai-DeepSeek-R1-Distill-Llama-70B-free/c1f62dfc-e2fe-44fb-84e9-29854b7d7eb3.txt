Question:

A property owner who owner her property in fee simple leased a three-story house and the 21 -acre tract upon which it stood to a friend for a term of 10 years. By the terms of the lease, the friend expressly covenanted to pay a monthly rental of $300 and to pay the taxes on the premises during the term of the lease. The lease also stipulated that the friend, as lessee, may not assign or sublease the said premises. The friend and his family lived in the house for two years. Then the friend assigned his leasehold interest in the property to a cousin, who was unaware of the prohibition against assignments. This written assignment expressly provided that the cousin would pay the owner the monthly rental of $300, but was silent concerning the payment of taxes. The owner never objected to this assignment. Six months after the assignment, the owner conveyed her property interest in the premises to a developer. During the cousin's tenancy, the State Highway Authority filed proceedings to condemn two acres of the tract for the purpose of highway construction. As a result, the cousin contacted the developer and informed him that he should be entitled to an apportioned reduction in the rental. After the developer refused to reduce the rent, the cousin brings an action to have his rent apportioned pro tanto. Judgment should be for

Options:

A: the cousin, because eminent domain operates as an apportionment of rent.
B: the developer, because the cousin would be held to the original leasehold contract.
C: the developer, because the cousin was not a party to the original lease agreement.
D: the cousin, because the friend violated the terms of the lease by assigning it without permission.
E: the cousin, because the developer did not have the authority to refuse a rent reduction.
F: the developer, as the prohibition against assignments was not known by the cousin.
G: the cousin, because the condemnation proceedings effectively changed the terms of the lease.
H: the developer, although the cousin would be entitled to terminate the lease.
I: the cousin, because the value of his leasehold interest was reduced pro tanto.
J: the developer, because the cousin failed to pay the taxes as stipulated in the original lease.

Okay, so I have this legal question about property law, specifically dealing with leases, assignments, and eminent domain. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

Alright, let's start by breaking down the problem. The scenario is about a property owner who leased her property to a friend for 10 years. The lease terms include paying $300 monthly and covering taxes. There's also a clause that the friend can't assign or sublease without permission. 

The friend lived there for two years, then assigned the lease to his cousin without the owner's permission. The assignment was in writing, and the cousin agreed to pay the $300 rent but didn't mention taxes. The owner didn't object to this assignment. Later, the owner sold the property to a developer. Now, during the cousin's tenancy, the state wants to condemn two acres for a highway. The cousin wants a reduction in rent because of this and is suing when the developer refuses.

The question is whether the cousin is entitled to an apportioned reduction in rent. The options are A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that when a lease is assigned, the assignee (cousin) steps into the shoes of the assignor (friend) and takes the lease subject to all its terms. But wait, the lease had a clause prohibiting assignment. So, did the friend have the right to assign without the owner's consent?

Generally, if a lease prohibits assignment, the tenant can't assign without the landlord's consent. But if the landlord doesn't object, does that mean consent was given? Or is the assignment still invalid? I think that if the landlord doesn't object, especially if they continue to accept rent, they might be deemed to have accepted the assignment, making it valid. So the cousin becomes the new tenant.

Now, the issue is about the condemnation. Eminent domain taking part of the leased property. In such cases, the doctrine of apportionment comes into play. Usually, when part of the leased premises is taken, the rent is apportioned. But does this apply automatically, or does it depend on the lease terms?

The lease here didn't mention anything about condemnation. So the general rule is that the tenant is entitled to an apportionment of the rent if part of the property is condemned. But wait, the original lease had the friend paying taxes. The cousin's assignment didn't mention taxesâ€”so does that mean the cousin isn't responsible for taxes? Or does the lease's original terms still apply?

Wait, the original lease required the friend to pay taxes. When the friend assigned the lease to the cousin, the cousin agreed to pay rent but not taxes. But does the assignment transfer all the terms, including the tax payment? Or did the cousin only take on the rent obligation?

Hmm, I think that when a lease is assigned, all terms and conditions are transferred to the assignee. So the cousin would be responsible for paying taxes as per the original lease. But in this case, the assignment was silent on taxes. Does that mean the cousin isn't liable for taxes, or is it implied?

Wait, the assignment was silent on taxes, but the original lease required the friend to pay them. So when assigning, the friend's obligations are passed on. So the cousin would be responsible for the taxes as well, unless the assignment specifically excludes that. But the question says the assignment didn't mention it, so maybe the cousin didn't take on that responsibility. Or perhaps the lease's terms are still binding.

But the more pressing issue is the condemnation and rent apportionment. So when the state takes part of the land, the lease is apportioned. The rent should be reduced proportionally. But who is responsible for that? The original landlord, or the new developer who bought the property?

Wait, the owner sold the property to the developer after the assignment. So the developer is now the landlord. But the lease was already assigned to the cousin. So the developer steps into the shoes of the original landlord and has the same rights and obligations.

So when part of the land is taken, the cousin, as the current tenant, can request an apportionment of the rent from the developer. But does the lease allow for that, or is it an inherent right?

I think under common law, when part of the premises is condemned, the tenant is entitled to a reduction in rent. This is because the landlord can't provide the full premises as agreed. So the rent is apportioned according to the value of what's taken. So the cousin should get a reduction.

Looking at the options, option A says the cousin wins because eminent domain apportions the rent. Option I says the cousin's lease value was reduced, so he's entitled. Option G says the condemnation changed the lease terms.

But wait, what about privity of contract? The cousin wasn't a party to the original lease; he's an assignee. But as an assignee, he's bound by the lease terms, and the landlord's rights are transferred to the developer. So the developer is now the landlord, and the cousin is the tenant. So when the condemnation happens, the developer, as landlord, is responsible for any apportionment.

Wait, but the original lease didn't mention anything about condemnation. So the general rule applies. The tenant can request apportionment. So the cousin is entitled to it.

But looking at the options, option A says the cousin wins because eminent domain operates as apportionment. Option I says because the lease value reduced.

Alternatively, option B says the developer wins because the cousin is bound by the original lease. But I think the original lease's terms are still in effect, so the apportionment applies.

Wait, another angle: the assignment was in violation of the lease's terms. The lease prohibited assignment, but the owner didn't object. So the assignment might be invalid, but the owner's acceptance of the situation (not objecting) might have made it valid. So the cousin is a valid assignee.

So, the developer, as the new landlord, has to deal with the cousin as the tenant. When the condemnation happens, the rent should be apportioned.

So the cousin should win, and the developer must reduce the rent. So looking at the options, option A or I.

Option A says that eminent domain operates as an apportionment. Option I says the lease value was reduced.

Wait, the doctrine is that the taking affects the lease, so the rent is apportioned. So the correct answer would be A or I.

Alternatively, another point is that the original lease required the friend to pay taxes. The cousin didn't agree to that. But the assignment might have transferred that obligation. If the cousin didn't pay taxes, maybe the developer could withhold that, but that's a separate issue.

In this case, the cousin is seeking a reduction in rent because of the condemnation. The developer refused, so the cousin sues.

So, the key is whether the cousin is entitled to apportionment. The answer should be yes.

Looking back, option A says the cousin wins because eminent domain apportions the rent. Option I says because the lease value was reduced.

Wait, I think the correct reasoning is that when a part is taken by eminent domain, the lease is apportioned, so the rent is reduced proportionally. So the answer would be A.

But wait, another point: the lease was for a three-story house and 21 acres. The condemnation is for two acres. So the house is still there, but two acres are taken. Does that affect the rent?

Yes, because the leased premises include the land. So the tenant is deprived of part of the land, so the rent should be apportioned.

So, the correct answer is A.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option A: the cousin, because eminent domain operates as an apportionment of rent.

Option I: the cousin, because the value of his leasehold interest was reduced pro tanto.

Both seem plausible, but I think the doctrine is that the rent is apportioned automatically upon condemnation, so A is correct.

Wait, but in some jurisdictions, the tenant might have to negotiate or the landlord might have to adjust. But the general rule is that when part is taken, the rent is apportioned without the need for a lease clause. So A would be correct.

Another point: the developer is now the landlord, so the cousin can seek apportionment from the developer. So the developer can't refuse.

So, the judgment should be for the cousin, so options A or I.

Wait, but the question is about whether the cousin can get the rent reduced. The lease was assigned without permission, but the landlord accepted it, so the cousin is a valid tenant.

So, the answer should be A.

The scenario involves a property owner who leased a three-story house and a 21-acre tract to a friend for 10 years. The lease prohibited assignment or subleasing without consent but was assigned to a cousin, who agreed to pay rent but not taxes. The owner did not object, effectively accepting the assignment. Later, the owner sold the property to a developer. During the cousin's tenancy, two acres were condemned for highway construction, and the cousin sought a rent reduction, which the developer refused.

Key legal principles include:

1. **Assignment and Privity of Contract**: The lease prohibited assignment, but the owner's failure to object likely validated the assignment. The cousin, as assignee, stepped into the friend's position, subject to the lease terms, including the duty to pay taxes.

2. **Eminent Domain and Rent Apportionment**: When part of the leased premises is condemned, the rent is typically apportioned proportionally under the doctrine of eminent domain. This applies regardless of whether the lease explicitly addresses condemnation.

3. **Developer's Liability**: The developer, as the new landlord, inherited the obligations of the original lease. The cousin, as the current tenant, is entitled to seek an apportionment of rent due to the condemnation.

Options analysis:

- **Option A**: Correct. Eminent domain operates to apportion the rent when part of the leased premises is taken.
- **Option I**: Also plausible, as the value of the leasehold interest was reduced, but the specific doctrine of apportionment under eminent domain makes Option A more precise.

The judgment should favor the cousin, as the condemnation entitled him to a rent reduction under the doctrine of apportionment.
