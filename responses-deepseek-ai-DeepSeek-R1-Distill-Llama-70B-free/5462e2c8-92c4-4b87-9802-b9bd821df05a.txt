Question:

After being severely beaten and sustaining a gunshot wound to the abdomen, a 42-year-old woman undergoes resection of a perforated small bowel. During the operation, plastic reconstruction of facial fractures, and open reduction and internal fixation of the left femur are also done. Thirty-six hours postoperatively, she is awake but not completely alert. She is receiving intravenous morphine via a patient-controlled pump. She says that she needs the morphine to treat her pain, but she is worried that she is becoming addicted. She has no history of substance use disorder. She drinks one to two glasses of wine weekly. Which of the following initial actions by the physician is most appropriate?

Options:

A: Advise her to drink more wine to help with the pain
B: Maintain the morphine, but periodically administer intravenous naloxone
C: Switch the patient to oral acetaminophen as soon as she can take medication orally
D: Recommend a consultation with a psychiatrist to address her fears of addiction
E: Suggest biofeedback therapy to control pain
F: Switch the patient to intramuscular lorazepam
G: Reassure the patient that her chance of becoming addicted to narcotics is minuscule
H: Administer methadone as an alternative to morphine
I: Increase the dose of morphine to relieve her anxiety
J: Encourage the patient to endure the pain without medication to prevent addiction

Okay, so I've got this medical question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question carefully.

The patient is a 42-year-old woman who was severely beaten and had a gunshot wound to the abdomen. She underwent surgery for a perforated small bowel resection. Also, during the operation, they did some plastic reconstruction of facial fractures and fixed her left femur with open reduction and internal fixation. Now, 36 hours after the surgery, she's awake but not completely alert. She's on intravenous morphine via a patient-controlled pump. She says she needs the morphine for her pain but is worried about becoming addicted. She has no history of substance use disorder and only drinks a little wine each week.

The question is asking what the physician should do initially. The options are from A to J.

Hmm. So, let's break this down. The key points are her current situation: post-major surgery, in pain, using morphine, and her concern about addiction.

I remember that addiction to opioids is a concern, but in the hospital setting, especially for acute pain, the risk is lower, especially in someone without a history of substance abuse. But I should think about the options given.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Advise her to drink more wine. That doesn't seem right. Using alcohol isn't a good solution for pain management, especially in a post-op patient. Plus, she's already on morphine, so mixing with alcohol could be dangerous, like respiratory depression.

Option B: Maintain morphine but give naloxone periodically. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist; it reverses opioid effects. But giving it periodically might counteract the pain relief. That doesn't seem appropriate for someone in pain. It could cause withdrawal symptoms too if given in this context.

Option C: Switch to oral acetaminophen as soon as she can take meds. Acetaminophen is a mild analgesic. But after major surgery and multiple injuries, her pain is probably severe. Acetaminophen might not be sufficient. Plus, switching too early might leave her in pain, which isn't good for recovery.

Option D: Recommend a psychiatrist consultation. She's expressing fear about addiction. But is that the immediate next step? She's in acute pain, so maybe addressing her concerns directly would be better first. Psychiatry consults might be more for ongoing mental health issues, not immediate concerns.

Option E: Suggest biofeedback. That's a non-pharmacological method. But in the acute post-op phase, she might not have the capacity to engage in biofeedback effectively. Plus, it's not a quick solution for her current pain.

Option F: Switch to intramuscular lorazepam. Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine, used for anxiety. But she's in pain, so using a benzo won't address the pain. It could help with anxiety, but not pain management.

Option G: Reassure her that the chance of addiction is minuscule. That sounds plausible because, in a hospital setting with short-term use, the risk is low, especially without a history of substance abuse. Reassurance might help her anxiety about addiction.

Option H: Administer methadone. Methadone is another opioid, but switching might not address her concern. Plus, methadone has its own issues, like longer half-life and potential for dependence. It's not typically the first choice in acute settings.

Option I: Increase morphine dose to relieve anxiety. Wait, morphine is for pain, not anxiety. Increasing the dose might not address her anxiety about addiction and could lead to over-sedation or other side effects.

Option J: Encourage her to endure pain without medication. That's unethical. Pain management is important for recovery. Letting her suffer isn't appropriate.

So, putting this together. The patient is in acute pain post-surgery and is using morphine as needed. She's worried about addiction, but she has no history of substance abuse. The most appropriate initial action is to reassure her that the risk is low in this context. That would address her anxiety without changing her treatment unnecessarily.

I think the correct answer is G. Reassure her that the chance is minuscule. This makes sense because her concerns are likely anxiety-driven, and in a controlled, acute setting, the risk of addiction is minimal. It's important to balance pain control with patient concerns, and reassurance here is appropriate.

The patient is a 42-year-old woman recovering from major surgery and trauma, receiving intravenous morphine for pain management. She expresses concern about addiction but has no history of substance use disorder. The most appropriate initial action is to reassure her that the risk of addiction is minuscule in this acute setting, as short-term opioid use in a hospital, especially without a history of substance abuse, carries a low risk. This approach addresses her anxiety while maintaining effective pain control.

Answer: G
