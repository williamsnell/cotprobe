Okay, so I've got this problem here about investing in bonds to get a certain annual income. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on bond calculations, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is: How much must be invested in $1,000 5% bonds to have an annual income from interest of $3,000 if the bonds sell at 74(7/8)? There's also a brokerage fee of $5 per bond. The options are from A to J.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I remember that bonds typically pay a fixed interest based on their face value. So each bond here is $1,000 face value, and it's a 5% bond. That means each bond pays $50 a year in interest because 5% of 1000 is 50.

The desired annual income is $3,000. So I need to find out how many bonds I need to buy to get $3,000 a year. If each bond gives $50, then the number of bonds needed would be 3000 divided by 50. Let me calculate that: 3000 / 50 equals 60. So I need 60 bonds.

But wait, that's just the number. I also need to consider the cost of each bond and the brokerage fee. The bonds are selling at 74 and 7/8 percent. Wait, what does that mean? I think that means the bond is selling at 74.875% of its face value. Because 7/8 of a percent is 0.875. So 74.875% of $1,000.

So 74.875% of 1000 is how much? Let me compute that. 0.74875 * 1000 equals 748.75 dollars per bond. So each bond costs $748.75.

But don't forget the brokerage fee. It's $5 per bond. So each bond actually costs 748.75 + 5 = 753.75 dollars.

Now, I need 60 bonds, so the total investment is 60 times 753.75. Let me do that multiplication. 60 * 753.75. Hmm, 60 times 700 is 42,000, 60 times 53.75 is 3,225. So adding those together, 42,000 + 3,225 equals 45,225.

Wait, let me check that again. 753.75 * 60. Let me break it down differently. 700 *60 is 42,000. 53.75 *60: 50*60 is 3,000 and 3.75*60 is 225. So 3,000 + 225 = 3,225. So total is 42,000 + 3,225 = 45,225. Yep, that's $45,225.

Looking back at the options, option C is $45,225. So the answer should be C.

I think that's all. Let me just recap: number of bonds needed is 60 because each gives $50, so 60*50=3000. Each bond costs 74.875% of 1000, which is 748.75, plus $5 fee, so 753.75 each. 60 *753.75 =45,225. So option C is correct.

To determine how much must be invested in $1,000 5% bonds to generate an annual income of $3,000, we proceed as follows:

1. **Interest per bond**: Each bond has a face value of $1,000 and a 5% annual interest rate. Thus, the annual interest per bond is:  
   \[
   \$1,000 \times 0.05 = \$50
   \]

2. **Number of bonds needed**: To achieve an annual income of $3,000, the number of bonds required is:  
   \[
   \frac{\$3,000}{\$50} = 60 \text{ bonds}
   \]

3. **Price per bond**: The bonds sell at 74\( \frac{7}{8} \), which is 74.875% of the face value. Therefore, the cost per bond is:  
   \[
   \$1,000 \times 0.74875 = \$748.75
   \]

4. **Brokerage fee**: Adding the $5 brokerage fee per bond, the total cost per bond becomes:  
   \[
   \$748.75 + \$5 = \$753.75
   \]

5. **Total investment**: For 60 bonds, the total investment is:  
   \[
   60 \times \$753.75 = \$45,225
   \]

Thus, the total amount that must be invested is **$45,225**, which corresponds to option C.
