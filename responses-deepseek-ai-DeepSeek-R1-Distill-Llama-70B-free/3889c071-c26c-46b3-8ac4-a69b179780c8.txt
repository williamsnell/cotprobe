Question:

A supermarket had just reopened after a two- week closing for renovations. On the morning of the reopening, a woman was shopping when she suddenly fell and suffered a broken leg. Thereafter, the woman sued the supermarket for personal injuries. In her suit, the woman claimed that she tripped over a paint bucket that had been lying in one of the aisles. At trial, the woman called another customer to testify that while he was shopping he heard a thud, turned around and saw the woman fall on the floor. He also testified that he saw an empty paint bucket lying a few feet from the woman's leg. On cross- examination, the customer got into an argumentative exchange with the supermarket's attorney. When asked his opinion of what caused the woman's fall, the customer testified, "She fell because she tripped on the bucket. " He admitted on cross-examination, however, that he didn't actually see the woman trip on the bucket. The supermarket's attorney then asked the customer the following question:"If you didn't see the woman trip on the bucket, how do you know that she fell because of it?" The customer answered, "Because my girlfriend who was shopping with me told me later that she saw the woman trip over the bucket. "The supermarket's attorney moves to strike the customer's last answer. If the trial judge overrules the defendant's motion and permits the customer's answer to stand, it will most likely be because

Options:

A: the customer's answer was based on a reliable source.
B: the customer's answer was invited by the supermarket's attorney's question.
C: the customer's answer was a lay opinion.
D: the customer's answer was an excited utterance.
E: the customer's answer was a statement of recent perception.
F: the customer's answer was based on firsthand knowledge.
G: the customer's answer was a present sense impression.
H: the customer's answer was a spontaneous statement.
I: the customer's answer was relevant to the case.

Okay, let's try to figure out this evidence question. So, the situation is a woman suing a supermarket after slipping and falling. She claims she tripped over a paint bucket. At trial, another customer testified that he heard a thud, saw her fall, and noticed an empty paint bucket nearby. But on cross, he admitted he didn't see her trip on it. Then, when asked how he knew she fell because of the bucket, he said his girlfriend told him later that she saw it happen.

The supermarket's attorney is moving to strike that last answer, and the question is why the judge might overrule that motion, letting the answer stand.

Hmm, I remember that hearsay is a big issue here. The customer is testifying about what his girlfriend said, which is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter (that the woman tripped on the bucket). So that's hearsay and generally inadmissible unless an exception applies.

Looking at the options, I need to think about the exceptions to the hearsay rule. The customer's statement about his girlfriend's information is hearsay within hearsay because there are two layers: the customer's statement and the girlfriend's statement. So both need to fall under exceptions.

Wait, but in this context, the customer is testifying as a witness. So maybe it's not hearsay if it's not being offered for the truth of the matter, but that doesn't seem right here. No, because he's stating it as the reason he believes she fell, so it's for the truth.

So, possible exceptions: excited utterance, present sense impression, or maybe statement of a witness's then-existing state of mind.

Alternatively, maybe it's a lay opinion. Lay opinion under FRE 701 could be based on the witness's perception and not require specialized knowledge. But wait, the customer's opinion that she tripped because of the bucket would be based on what his girlfriend told him, which he didn't perceive himself. So I don't think that's a valid lay opinion because lay opinions must be based on the witness's own observations or experiences.

Another angle: when a witness is testifying, prior statements made by other people can sometimes be admissible if they fit an exception. But what exception applies here?

Wait, perhaps the statement is admissible under the 'residual exception' (FRE 807), but that's a catch-all and requires certain conditions like trustworthiness and necessity. I don't know if that applies here.

Alternatively, maybe the girlfriend's statement was a present sense impression. FRE 803(1) allows statements describing an event made while the declarant was perceiving it or immediately thereafter. If the girlfriend saw the incident and told the customer right after, that could fit. But the customer is testifying about what she said later. However, the timing isn't specified here, so it's unclear.

Wait, but the incident happened that morning, and the testimony is on the same day, perhaps. If the girlfriend told him immediately after the fall, that could be a present sense impression. But without knowing the exact timing, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe it's a statement of recent perception, but that's more about the declarant's memory.

Wait, another thought: when a witness is cross-examined, the opposing party might open the door to certain information. If the supermarket's attorney asked the question about how he knew, perhaps that allows the customer to explain, even if it's hearsay. But I'm not sure if that's a rule.

Looking at the options again:

Option B says the answer was invited by the attorney's question. That could be a possible reason. Because if the attorney asked the question prompting the witness to explain, the witness's answer, even if hearsay, might be allowed because it was invited. But I'm not certain if that's a valid exception or just a procedural aspect.

Option E is about a statement of recent perception. If the girlfriend's statement was made shortly after the event, it could be a present sense impression or a statement of recent perception.

Option G is present sense impression, which requires the statement to be made while perceiving the event or immediately after. If the girlfriend told the customer right after seeing the fall, that could qualify.

Alternatively, if the customer's answer is based on the girlfriend's statement, and that's hearsay, the judge might allow it under an exception.

Wait, but the question is why the judge overruled the motion to strike. So the answer is that the statement is admissible under one of the hearsay exceptions.

But without more context on timing, it's hard. Alternatively, perhaps the customer's testimony about his girlfriend's statement is not hearsay because it's not being offered for the truth. Wait, no, because he's using it to prove that the woman tripped on the bucket, which is the truth of the matter.

Alternatively, maybe the statement is a lay opinion. The customer is giving his opinion that she tripped on the bucket. But under FRE 701, a lay witness's opinion must be based on their perception. Here, his opinion is based on his girlfriend's statement, which he didn't perceive himself. So that might not qualify as a valid lay opinion.

Wait, but maybe the opinion is based on his own knowledge that the bucket was there and his girlfriend's statement. So perhaps it's a combination, but I'm not sure.

Going back to the options, option B says it was invited by the attorney's question. That might be a reason because the attorney asked him how he knew, prompting the answer, so the court might allow it as the attorney 'opened the door'. But I'm not certain if that's a hearsay exception or just a procedural ruling.

Alternatively, if the girlfriend's statement is a present sense impression, then it's admissible. But the customer is recounting it, so it's hearsay within hearsay. Both layers need exceptions.

So, the first layer is the girlfriend's statement. If it's a present sense impression (she made it while perceiving the event), then that layer is okay. The second layer is the customer's testimony about it. Is that layer admissible? Well, the customer is testifying about a statement made to him. But unless it's a statement of then-existing state of mind or something, it might not fit another exception.

Wait, but the customer's statement about his girlfriend's statement is being offered for the truth, so it's hearsay. Unless it fits another exception.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement is not hearsay because it's a statement by a witness's companion, made during the event. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the witness's answer was in response to a question on cross-examination. The attorney's question was, "If you didn't see the woman trip on the bucket, how do you know that she fell because of it?" The witness's answer explains the basis of his earlier opinion. But the earlier opinion was that she tripped because of the bucket, which he gave in direct testimony.

Wait, in direct, he testified that he saw the bucket and that she fell. Then on cross, he admitted he didn't see the trip. Then, when asked how he knew, he said his girlfriend told him. So perhaps his initial opinion was based on his own observation of the bucket and the fall, but on cross, he had to admit he didn't see the actual trip, so his basis was actually his girlfriend's statement.

But wait, in his direct testimony, he said he heard a thud, saw her fall, and saw the bucket. Then he gave his opinion that she tripped on the bucket. On cross, he admitted he didn't see the trip. Then, when asked how he knew, he cited his girlfriend's statement.

So, perhaps the initial opinion was based on his own perception, and the later explanation was additional basis. But the initial opinion might have been a lay opinion under 701, but now he's adding that his girlfriend told him. So the explanation might be hearsay.

But if the opinion was initially admissible as a lay opinion based on his own perception, then on cross, when asked to explain, he can explain the basis, even if it's hearsay, because it's part of his testimony. Or perhaps because the opposing counsel's question opened the door.

Wait, but the initial opinion was that she tripped on the bucket. The basis for that opinion was his observation of the bucket and her fall. But on cross, he admitted he didn't see the trip, so his opinion's basis was weakened. Then, explaining that his girlfriend told him might be a new basis, but that's hearsay.

Alternatively, maybe the statement is admissible as a statement of the witness's then-existing state of mind. But I think that's for the witness's own state of mind, not someone else's.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement is a statement against interest, but that doesn't apply here.

Wait, going back to the options, option B says it was invited by the attorney's question. So if the attorney's question led to the answer, the court might allow it, even if it's hearsay, because the question was posed. But I'm not sure if that's a valid reason or just a tactical decision.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement is not hearsay because it's a statement by a party opponent. But the girlfriend isn't a party, so that doesn't apply.

Another angle: the statement by the girlfriend could be a statement of identification of a person made after perceiving them, under FRE 801(d)(1)(C), but that's for identifying a person, not an event.

Alternatively, maybe it's a statement offered to show the customer's basis for his opinion, but that's still hearsay.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. The key issue is that the customer's answer is hearsay, but the judge allowed it. So the reason must be an exception.

Looking again at the options:

Option B: invited by the attorney's question. Maybe the attorney's question opened the door, allowing the witness to explain, even if it's hearsay. But I'm not sure if that's a valid exception.

Option E: statement of recent perception. If the girlfriend's statement was made recently, perhaps that applies.

Option G: present sense impression. If she described the event while perceiving it or immediately after, this could apply.

But without knowing the timing, it's hard to say. However, in the scenario, the fall happened that morning, and the testimony is on the same day. So maybe the girlfriend's statement was made shortly after, making it a present sense impression.

So, the customer's answer would be admissible under the present sense impression exception, as the girlfriend's statement was made while she was perceiving the event or immediately after. Therefore, the hearsay exception applies, and the judge allows it.

But wait, the customer is testifying about the girlfriend's statement, so it's hearsay within hearsay. Both layers need exceptions. The first layer (girlfriend's statement) could be a present sense impression, and the second layer (customer testifying about it) would need another exception, perhaps as a statement of a witness's basis for opinion, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if the customer's statement is based on the girlfriend's statement, which is a present sense impression, but the customer's testimony about it is hearsay. Unless it's a statement by a witness who is testifying and is subject to cross-examination, but that doesn't automatically make it admissible.

Hmm, perhaps the better approach is to look at the answer options and see which one fits.

Option B: the answer was invited by the attorney's question. That might be a reason the court allows it, even if it's hearsay, because the attorney's question prompted it.

But I'm not sure if that's the case. Usually, hearsay exceptions are substantive, not procedural. So the fact that the question was asked wouldn't make hearsay admissible unless an exception applies.

So perhaps the correct answer is B, but I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, another approach: the customer's answer explains the basis for his earlier testimony. On direct, he gave his opinion that she tripped on the bucket. On cross, when asked how he knew, he explained that his girlfriend told him. So perhaps his answer is admissible as the basis for his opinion, but that doesn't make it not hearsay.

Alternatively, maybe it's a statement against interest, but that doesn't apply here.

Wait, perhaps the statement is admissible under the 'state of mind' exception. But that's for the declarant's state of mind, not the event.

I think I'm stuck between options B and G. But considering that the customer is testifying about a statement made to him, which would be hearsay, unless an exception applies.

If the girlfriend's statement was a present sense impression, then the first layer is okay. The second layer is the customer's testimony about it, which is hearsay, but perhaps admissible under another exception or because it's not being offered for the truth. But that doesn't make sense because it's being offered for the truth.

Alternatively, perhaps the customer's answer is a lay opinion, but as I thought earlier, lay opinions must be based on the witness's own perception, which he doesn't have here.

Wait, wait. The customer's initial opinion was based on his own observation of the bucket and the fall. Then, on cross, he admitted he didn't see the trip, so his opinion's foundation was attacked. But then he explains that his girlfriend told him, which supports his opinion. So maybe the statement is admissible to rebut the attack on his credibility. But that's more about the admissibility of the evidence for that purpose, not a hearsay exception.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The key is that the customer's answer is hearsay. The question is why the judge allowed it.

Another possibility: the statement is not hearsay because it's a statement offered to show the customer's basis for his opinion, not for the truth. But no, because the basis is being used to prove the truth of the matter (that she tripped on the bucket), so it's still hearsay.

Wait, but under FRE 803, there are exceptions. One of them is statements of personal knowledge, but that's for the declarant's knowledge.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement is admissible under the residual exception, but that requires notice and other factors, which aren't mentioned here.

Hmm, maybe the correct answer is B, that the answer was invited by the attorney's question. Because the attorney asked how he knew, prompting the witness to explain, and courts sometimes allow such explanations even if they're hearsay, as the questioning party has opened the door.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a lay opinion, but I don't think so because the opinion is based on someone else's statement.

Wait, another thought: the statement could be a statement of a witness's memory. But that doesn't make it not hearsay.

I think I'm going to have to make a decision here. The most plausible reason is that the attorney's question invited the answer, so the judge allows it, even if it's hearsay. So option B is the reason.

The question revolves around the admissibility of the customer's testimony, which involves hearsay. The customer testified that his girlfriend told him she saw the woman trip over the bucket, and the supermarket's attorney moved to strike this statement. The judge's decision to overrule the motion and allow the statement to stand likely hinges on the application of hearsay exceptions or procedural considerations.

The customer's statement is hearsay because it is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (that the woman tripped over the bucket). For it to be admissible, it must fall under a hearsay exception. Several exceptions were considered:

1. **Present Sense Impression (FRE 803(1))**: If the girlfriend's statement was made while she was perceiving the event or immediately thereafter, it could qualify as a present sense impression. However, the timing of her statement is not specified, making this uncertain.

2. **Lay Opinion (FRE 701)**: The customer's opinion that the woman tripped over the bucket could be admissible as a lay opinion. However, his opinion is based on his girlfriend's statement, not his own perception, which weakens its validity as a lay opinion.

3. **Invited by the Attorney's Question**: The supermarket's attorney asked how the customer knew the woman fell because of the bucket, prompting the customer to explain. This could be interpreted as "opening the door" to the explanation, allowing the statement to stand as a procedural matter, even if it is hearsay.

4. **Other Exceptions**: Other exceptions, such as excited utterance or statement of recent perception, were considered but lacked sufficient foundation in the scenario.

The most plausible reason for the judge overruling the motion is that the attorney's question invited the customer's explanation. By asking how the customer knew the woman fell because of the bucket, the attorney opened the door to the explanation, making it procedurally appropriate to allow the statement to stand.
