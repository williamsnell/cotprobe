Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Gauthier's views on practical rationality. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking what Gauthier claims there's nothing for practical rationality to be besides. The options are A through J, each representing a different type of justification or an illusion. 

I remember that David Gauthier is a philosopher known for his work in ethics and rational choice theory. His book "Morals by Agreement" comes to mind. In that, he discusses the idea of rational choice and how it relates to morality. 

Practical rationality, as opposed to theoretical rationality, is about action. Theoretical rationality is more about beliefs and what we should believe based on evidence. Practical rationality, on the other hand, deals with what we should do. 

Now, Gauthier is associated with a certain view of practical rationality. I recall that he's a defender of a specific type of justification. He argues that practical rationality is about deliberation, the process of deciding what to do based on reasons. So, he's probably saying that practical rationality is solely about deliberative justification.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. Some other options are logical, epistemic, moral, etc. Logical justification would be more about the structure of arguments, which seems more theoretical. Epistemic is about knowledge and belief, again theoretical. Moral justification is about right and wrong actions, but Gauthier's point is that practical rationality isn't about morality per se but about the process of making decisions based on reasons.

So, deliberative justification makes sense because it's the process of weighing options and reasons. Gauthier might argue that there's nothing more to practical rationality than this deliberative process. 

Other options like emotional or spiritual justification don't fit because they're not central to his view. An illusion? No, Gauthier doesn't think practical rationality is an illusion; he has a positive account of it.

So putting it all together, the answer should be G: deliberative justification.

Gauthier argues that practical rationality is fundamentally about the process of deliberation, where individuals weigh options and reasons to decide what to do. This aligns with the concept of deliberative justification. 

Answer: G
