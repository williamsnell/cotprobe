Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this neuroscience question about action potentials in neurons. Hmm, let's see what the question is asking.

So, the setup is that a researcher is using neurons from a giant squid. At the start, the axon is at rest with a threshold of –70 mV at 37°C. Then, it receives one stimulus that triggers an action potential. After that, subsequent stimuli are much stronger. The question is about what happens when several strong stimuli are applied.

I remember that neurons have a resting membrane potential, which is typically around –70 mV. The threshold for action potential is usually about –55 mV, but here the threshold is given as –70 mV. Wait, that's lower than usual. Oh, maybe in this case, the threshold is the same as the resting potential. Or perhaps the question is simplifying things.

When a stimulus is applied, if it's strong enough to reach the threshold, it triggers an action potential. Once that happens, the membrane goes through depolarization, then repolarization, and maybe hyperpolarization. After an action potential, there's a refractory period. 

Wait, refractory periods are crucial here. The refractory period is the time during and after the action potential when the neuron is either unable to initiate another action potential (absolute refractory period) or can only do so with a stronger-than-normal stimulus (relative refractory period). 

So, after the first action potential, the axon enters the absolute refractory period. During this time, no matter how strong the stimulus is, the neuron can't fire again. The sodium channels are inactivated. So if subsequent stimuli are applied during this time, even if they're stronger, they won't cause another action potential.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: Frequency increases. Hmm, but if the stimuli are applied during the refractory period, the neuron can't fire again, so the frequency wouldn't increase. Unless the stimuli are applied after the refractory period, but the question says several strong stimuli. I think the key is that after an action potential, the neuron can't respond immediately.

Option B: Strength of action potential decreases. Wait, the strength is determined by the number of ions, but each action potential is an all-or-none response. So the strength shouldn't decrease; each action potential is the same. Unless the stimuli are subthreshold, but in this case, the subsequent stimuli are stronger. But if they're applied during the refractory period, they won't cause another AP.

Option C: Depolarized to +50 mV. That sounds like the peak of the action potential. But that's the initial depolarization phase. Once the action potential is over, the membrane repolarizes and might even hyperpolarize a bit. But this option is about after several strong stimuli. If the axon is still in the refractory period, it can't depolarize again.

Option D: Depolarized to –30 mV. That's still depolarized compared to resting, but not as much as the peak. Maybe during the relative refractory period, but again, during the absolute period, the axon can't respond.

Option E: Strength of action potential becomes greater. No, because each action potential is all-or-none. The strength doesn't vary beyond the threshold.

Option F: Hyperpolarized to –100 mV. That's more polarized than the resting potential, which is –70. Hyperpolarization occurs after repolarization, but typically to around –80 maybe. I don't think it goes as low as –100. Maybe if the cell is inhibited, but that's not the case here.

Option G: Frequency decreases. Well, if the axon is in the refractory period, it can't fire again, so the frequency would be limited. But if the question is about several stimuli in a row, the neuron can't respond, so no increase. So the frequency wouldn't increase, but would it decrease? Or would it just stay at zero? Since the first stimulus caused one AP, the next stimuli during refractory period don't cause more, so the overall count is just one. So frequency is lower than what it would be without the refractory period. Hmm, but the stimuli are applied after the first AP. So if they're within the refractory period, no APs. So the frequency is lower than if the stimuli were spaced appropriately.

Option H: Hyperpolarized to –90 mV. That's more than resting. Let's think, after an action potential, during hyperpolarization, the membrane potential might go to around –90, but it varies. For squid axons, I think it's about –70 at rest, and after AP, maybe –90 for a bit. So if the axon is hyperpolarized, the next stimulus has to be stronger to reach threshold. But the question is about several strong stimuli. If they are applied during the hyperpolarization phase, even if they're strong, the axon might not fire because during the relative refractory period, you need a stronger stimulus. But if the stimuli are much stronger, maybe they can reach threshold again. Wait, but the absolute refractory period is when no stimulus can cause an AP. So during that time, even very strong stimuli can't trigger another AP.

So let's break it down step by step. The first stimulus triggers an AP. Then, the axon is in the absolute refractory period, during which no stimuli can cause another AP. So the subsequent strong stimuli during this time won't result in any APs. Once the absolute period ends and the relative begins, maybe a stronger stimulus could cause another AP. But the question says the stimuli are much stronger. If the hyperpolarization is at –90 and the threshold is –70, then the membrane needs to depolarize 20 mV to reach threshold. If the stimuli are strong enough, perhaps they can.

Wait, but the initial threshold was at –70 mV. After hyperpolarization, the threshold might remain the same. So if the membrane is at –90, and the threshold is –70, any stimulus that brings it to –70 would trigger an AP. So if the stimuli are much stronger, maybe they can. But if the axon is in the relative refractory period, the threshold is actually higher. Or is it lower? Wait, during relative refractory period, the threshold is higher, so a stronger stimulus is needed. So if the subsequent stimuli are much stronger, perhaps they can now reach the higher threshold.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. After the action potential, during the relative refractory period, the membrane is hyperpolarized. The threshold during that time is higher (closer to zero) than the resting threshold. So for example, normally the threshold is –70, but during relative refractory, it might be –60 or something. So a stimulus that brings the membrane from –90 to –60 would be a 30 mV depolarization. So whether the stimulus is enough depends on its strength.

But the question says subsequent stimuli are much stronger. So if the threshold is temporarily higher (e.g., –55), but the stimulus can depolarize sufficiently, then maybe another AP occurs.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recap. The resting threshold is –70 mV. When at rest, a stimulus must bring the membrane to –70 to trigger an AP. After an AP, during the absolute refractory period, you can't have another AP no matter what. Then, during the relative refractory period, the threshold is higher; the membrane is hyperpolarized, so it's harder to reach the threshold.

So if the axon is at –90 mV (hyperpolarized) during the relative refractory period, and the threshold is maybe –60, then a stimulus that brings it from –90 to, say, –50 would not reach threshold. But if the stimulus is strong enough to bring it to –60, then an AP would occur.

But the question says that the subsequent stimuli are much stronger. So perhaps they can bring the membrane from –90 to beyond the new threshold. But the initial threshold was –70, but during relative refractory, maybe it's higher.

Wait, but if the initial threshold was –70, and the resting potential is –70, that's a bit confusing. Usually, the resting potential is more negative than the threshold. Like, resting is –70, threshold is –55. But in the problem statement, the threshold is given as –70. So maybe the resting is more negative than that? Or perhaps the question is simplifying.

Hmm, maybe I should look at the options again. Let's read the options.

Option H says the axon becomes hyperpolarized to –90 mV. That would happen after the action potential, during the hyperpolarization phase. So the membrane goes beyond the resting potential. So that's possible.

But the question is about what happens when several strong stimuli are applied. So after the first AP, the axon is in refractory periods. If the stimuli are applied during the absolute refractory period, no AP. If during the relative, maybe.

But regardless, the first thing that happens after an AP is hyperpolarization. So the membrane becomes more negative than resting, perhaps to –90.

So looking at the options, option H says hyperpolarized to –90. Option I says –50, which is less polarized. Option F is –100, which is probably too much.

So the correct answer would be H, the axon becomes hyperpolarized to –90 mV. But wait, the question is about what happens when several strong stimuli are experienced.

Wait, but the first part says the axon receives one stimulus that triggers one AP. Then, subsequent stronger stimuli are applied. So after the first AP, what happens?

The axon will go into the refractory period. The first phase is absolute, then relative, then back to resting.

If the subsequent stimuli are applied during the absolute refractory, nothing happens. If during relative, maybe another AP.

But the question is about several strong stimuli. So perhaps the axon is in a state where it can't respond, so the stimuli don't cause any APs. So the answer would be that the axon is hyperpolarized, or that it remains at rest.

Wait, option J says the axon remains at rest despite the stimuli. But after an AP, it's not at rest; it's hyperpolarized. So J is incorrect.

Alternatively, what if the several strong stimuli are applied after the refractory period? Then the axon could fire again. But the question says the subsequent stimuli are much stronger, but it doesn't specify the timing. It's possible that they are applied during the refractory period.

In any case, the action potential is followed by hyperpolarization. So the membrane goes from +50 (peak) back to –70, and then to –90, then back to –70.

So the correct statement is that the axon becomes hyperpolarized to –90 mV, which is option H.

Looking back at the options, H is: The axon becomes hyperpolarized to –90 mV.

Yes, that makes sense.

The question involves a neuron from a giant squid with a resting membrane potential of –70 mV and a threshold for action potential also at –70 mV. When the axon receives a stimulus strong enough to trigger an action potential, it undergoes depolarization, repolarization, and hyperpolarization. After the action potential, the axon enters the refractory period, which includes an absolute refractory period (during which no stimulus can trigger another action potential) and a relative refractory period (during which a stronger-than-normal stimulus is required to trigger another action potential).

The subsequent stimuli in the question are described as "much stronger," but the timing of these stimuli relative to the refractory periods is not explicitly stated. If the stimuli are applied during the absolute refractory period, no action potential can occur regardless of the stimulus strength. If the stimuli are applied during the relative refractory period, the threshold for triggering an action potential is higher, and whether an action potential occurs depends on whether the stimuli are strong enough to reach this elevated threshold.

However, the question specifically asks what happens when several strong stimuli are experienced by the axon. After the first action potential, the axon undergoes hyperpolarization, during which the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential, typically reaching values such as –90 mV. This hyperpolarization is consistent with normal neuronal physiology following an action potential.

Among the options provided:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The frequency of action potentials does not increase during the refractory period.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The strength of the action potential does not decrease; each action potential is an all-or-none response.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Depolarization to +50 mV occurs during the peak of the action potential, not in response to subsequent stimuli during the refractory period.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Depolarization to –30 mV is not relevant to the refractory period or hyperpolarization.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The strength of the action potential does not become greater; it remains constant.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Hyperpolarization to –100 mV is not typical; the membrane potential usually hyperpolarizes to around –90 mV.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The frequency of action potentials does not decrease; it is limited by the refractory period.
- **Option H**: Correct. The axon becomes hyperpolarized to –90 mV after the action potential, which is consistent with normal neuronal physiology.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. Hyperpolarization to –50 mV is less than the resting potential and does not match typical hyperpolarization values.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The axon does not remain at rest; it undergoes hyperpolarization after the action potential.

The correct answer is that the axon becomes hyperpolarized to –90 mV after the action potential.
