Okay, so I've got this question here about a sentence: "Mommy gived me a cookie." And I need to figure out what linguistic concept it best illustrates. The options are from A to J, each representing different terms. I remember that these terms relate to child language development, so I'll have to think about each one.

First, let me break down the sentence. The key part here is "gived." I know that in standard English, the past tense of "give" is "gave." So the child says "gived" instead. That makes me think of how children often add "ed" to verbs when they're learning past tense, even if it's irregular.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Prelinguistic speech. That's before they start using language, like babbling. Doesn't fit here because the child is using sentences.

B: Overgeneralization. Oh right, overgeneralization is when kids apply a rule too broadly. Like using "ed" for all past tenses, even irregular ones. So "gived" is an example of that.

C: Syntax. That's the structure of sentences, how words are arranged. But the issue here is the verb form, not the word order. So probably not syntax.

D: Semantics. That's about meaning. The sentence still makes sense, so semantics isn't the issue here.

E: Grammar. Well, grammar is a broad term that includes syntax, morphology, etc. The mistake here is a grammatical error, but the question is about the specific concept.

F: Holophrases. Those are single words that convey a whole message, like "mama" meaning "I want mama." The sentence here is multiple words, so not that.

G: Phonology. That's about sounds. The mistake isn't in pronunciation but in the verb form, so phonology isn't the right fit.

H: Pragmatics. That's how language is used in context, like knowing how to start a conversation. The sentence is grammatically incorrect but contextually clear, so pragmatics isn't the issue.

I: Phonemes. These are the smallest units of sound. Again, the error is in the verb ending, not the sound.

J: Morphemes. These are the smallest units of meaning, like the "ed" ending. Oh, wait, but the child is adding "ed" where it's not correct. So that's about morphology, which is part of grammar. But the specific process is called overgeneralization because the child is applying the "ed" rule too widely.

So putting it together, the error in "gived" is an example of overgeneralization. The child is using the regular past tense ending on an irregular verb, which is a common stage in language development.

The sentence "Mommy gived me a cookie" illustrates a linguistic concept where the child incorrectly applies the past tense rule by adding "ed" to the verb "give," which should be "gave." This is an example of overgeneralization, where a grammatical rule is applied too broadly, even to exceptions.

Answer: B
