Okay, so I have this problem where I need to use the Trapezoidal Rule to approximate the integral of sin²(x) from 0 to π. Hmm, I remember that the Trapezoidal Rule is a method for approximating the definite integral when you can't find an exact antiderivative easily. But wait, wait, in this case, I think there is an exact solution. Oh right, because I recall that the integral of sin²(x) over a full period is something known, but the question specifically asks for the Trapezoidal approximation, so I need to go through the steps.

First, I should recall the formula for the Trapezoidal Rule. I think it's something like (h/2) multiplied by the sum of the function evaluated at each point, plus the first and last terms multiplied by 1. Or wait, maybe more accurately, it's (h/2) [f(x₀) + 2f(x₁) + 2f(x₂) + ... + 2f(x_{n-1}) + f(xₙ)] where h is the step size and n is the number of intervals. Oh right, because the first and last terms are only counted once, and all the middle ones are multiplied by 2.

But wait, the question doesn't specify the number of intervals or the step size. Hmmm. Oh wait, I think sometimes when the problem just says "use the Trapezoidal Rule" without specifying, they might be assuming a certain n, like maybe n=1 or n=2? Or perhaps the function is being evaluated at the endpoints and midpoints? Wait, no, the problem doesn't give any n, so maybe I'm missing something. Oh wait, perhaps the question is using a specific n, but it's not given. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I should check the options to see if any of them match known values.

Wait, the integral from 0 to π of sin²(x) dx. I remember that the exact value of this integral is (π/2). Because the average value of sin² over a full period is 1/2, so over the interval from 0 to π, which is half a period, it's (1/2)*π. So the exact value is π/2, which is approximately 1.570796. Looking at the options, D is 1.570796, which would be the exact value. But since the question is asking for the Trapezoidal approximation, perhaps using a certain number of intervals, maybe n=1 or n=2, the approximation might be different.

Wait, if n is the number of intervals, then the number of points would be n+1. For example, if n=1, then we have two points, x0=0 and x1=π. Then h would be (π-0)/1 = π. Then the Trapezoidal approximation would be (h/2) [f(x0) + f(x1)]. Let's compute that.

f(x) = sin²(x), so f(0) = sin²(0) = 0. f(π) = sin²(π) = 0. So the approximation would be (π/2) * (0 + 0) = 0. But none of the options are zero. Hmm, that's confusing. So maybe n is larger.

Alternatively, perhaps they used n=2. Then h would be π/2. The points would be x0=0, x1=π/2, x2=π. So f(x0)=0, f(x1)=sin²(π/2)=1, f(x2)=0. Then the Trapezoidal sum would be (h/2) [f(x0) + 2f(x1) + f(x2)] = (π/2 / 2) [0 +2*1 +0] = (π/4) * 2 = π/2. So that gives the same as the exact value. So the approximation would be π/2, which is option D.

But wait, that seems too easy. Because the Trapezoidal Rule with n=2 in this case gives the exact result because the function is symmetric and the approximation happens to hit it just right. So in that case, the answer would be D, which is 1.570796.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to use n=4 or some other number. Let me test for n=4, just to see. Then h would be π/4. The points would be at 0, π/4, π/2, 3π/4, π.

Compute f at each point:

f(0) = 0
f(π/4) = sin²(π/4) = (sqrt(2)/2)^2 = 0.5
f(π/2) = 1
f(3π/4) = sin²(3π/4) = same as π/4, 0.5
f(π) = 0

So the sum would be (h/2) [f(0) + 2*(f(π/4) + f(π/2) + f(3π/4)) + f(π)].

Plugging in the numbers:

h = π/4

Sum inside: 0 + 2*(0.5 +1 +0.5) +0 = 2*(2) =4

So the approximation is (π/4 / 2) *4 = (π/8)*4 = π/2. So again, same result.

Wait, that's the exact value again. So perhaps for even n, the Trapezoidal Rule gives the exact value for this function because of its symmetry. So that would mean that the answer is D.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.570796, which is exactly π/2. So that must be the correct answer.

To approximate the integral $\int_0^{\pi} \sin^2(x) \, dx$ using the Trapezoidal Rule, we start by recalling the formula for the Trapezoidal Rule:

\[
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx \approx \frac{h}{2} \left[ f(x_0) + 2f(x_1) + 2f(x_2) + \dots + 2f(x_{n-1}) + f(x_n) \right],
\]

where \( h = \frac{b-a}{n} \) is the step size, \( n \) is the number of intervals, and \( x_i = a + ih \) for \( i = 0, 1, 2, \dots, n \).

### Step 1: Analyze the problem
The integral of $\sin^2(x)$ over $[0, \pi]$ is a standard integral. The exact value is known to be:

\[
\int_0^{\pi} \sin^2(x) \, dx = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

However, the question specifically asks for the Trapezoidal Rule approximation. The number of intervals \( n \) is not specified, so we test small values of \( n \) to see if the approximation matches the exact value.

### Step 2: Test \( n = 2 \)
For \( n = 2 \), the step size is:

\[
h = \frac{\pi - 0}{2} = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

The points are \( x_0 = 0 \), \( x_1 = \frac{\pi}{2} \), and \( x_2 = \pi \). Evaluating the function at these points:

\[
f(x_0) = \sin^2(0) = 0, \quad f(x_1) = \sin^2\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 1, \quad f(x_2) = \sin^2(\pi) = 0.
\]

The Trapezoidal Rule approximation becomes:

\[
\int_0^{\pi} \sin^2(x) \, dx \approx \frac{h}{2} \left[ f(x_0) + 2f(x_1) + f(x_2) \right] = \frac{\pi}{4} \left[ 0 + 2(1) + 0 \right] = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

This matches the exact value of the integral.

### Step 3: Verify with \( n = 4 \)
For \( n = 4 \), the step size is:

\[
h = \frac{\pi - 0}{4} = \frac{\pi}{4}.
\]

The points are \( x_0 = 0 \), \( x_1 = \frac{\pi}{4} \), \( x_2 = \frac{\pi}{2} \), \( x_3 = \frac{3\pi}{4} \), and \( x_4 = \pi \). Evaluating the function at these points:

\[
f(x_0) = \sin^2(0) = 0, \quad f(x_1) = \sin^2\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{1}{2}, \quad f(x_2) = \sin^2\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 1,
\]
\[
f(x_3) = \sin^2\left(\frac{3\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{1}{2}, \quad f(x_4) = \sin^2(\pi) = 0.
\]

The Trapezoidal Rule approximation becomes:

\[
\int_0^{\pi} \sin^2(x) \, dx \approx \frac{h}{2} \left[ f(x_0) + 2f(x_1) + 2f(x_2) + 2f(x_3) + f(x_4) \right],
\]

\[
\int_0^{\pi} \sin^2(x) \, dx \approx \frac{\pi}{8} \left[ 0 + 2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 2(1) + 2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 0 \right] = \frac{\pi}{8} \cdot 4 = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

Again, this matches the exact value of the integral.

### Conclusion
The Trapezoidal Rule approximation for $\int_0^{\pi} \sin^2(x) \, dx$ yields the exact value $\frac{\pi}{2}$ for both $n = 2$ and $n = 4$. This is due to the symmetry of the function $\sin^2(x)$ over the interval $[0, \pi]$. The approximate value is:

\[
\frac{\pi}{2} \approx 1.570796.
\]
