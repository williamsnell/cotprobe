Okay, I'm trying to figure out this question about Lukianoff and Haidt's argument on trigger warnings. So, the question is asking what kind of pathological thinking they associate with trigger warnings. The options are A: fortune-telling, B: blaming, C: dichotomous thinking, D: resentment.

First, I need to remember what I know about Lukianoff and Haidt's work. I think they wrote a book called "The Coddling of the American Mind" where they discuss how certain trends in society and education might be harming young people's mental health and resilience.

In that book, they talk about three Great Untruths. The first is that what doesn't kill you makes you weaker, which is about fragility. The second is that you should always trust your feelings, and the third is that life is a battle between good and evil people. Wait, or was it something else? Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the details a bit.

Wait, I think the three Great Untruths are:
1. The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker.
2. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings.
3. The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people.

But how does this tie into pathological thinking styles? I remember that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) identifies common cognitive distortions, which are ways of thinking that can lead to mental health issues. Lukianoff and Haidt probably connect trigger warnings to one of these distortions.

So, looking at the options:
A: Fortune-telling is a cognitive distortion where someone predicts the future negatively without evidence. Like assuming the worst will happen.
B: Blaming is when you hold others responsible for your own problems.
C: Dichotomous thinking is seeing things in black and white, all or nothing terms.
D: Resentment is holding onto anger, but I'm not sure if that's one of the CBT distortions.

Wait, what's the argument about trigger warnings? Lukianoff and Haidt might say that trigger warnings encourage people to avoid certain topics because they believe those topics will cause them harm. So, they're making a negative prediction about the future (that they can't handle it, or that it will cause distress), which is like fortune-telling. Or perhaps they're seeing the world in a way that divides things into safe vs. dangerous, which would be dichotomous thinking.

Alternatively, if trigger warnings are based on the idea that certain content is so harmful that it must be avoided, that could be an example of dichotomous thinking—like categorizing things as either completely safe or completely dangerous, with no middle ground.

Wait, but another angle is that trigger warnings are about emotional reasoning. If someone assumes that feeling distressed by content means it's harmful, that's trusting their feelings too much. Or maybe it's about catastrophizing, which is a type of fortune-telling.

I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The three Great Untruths might tie into the cognitive distortions. For example, the Us Versus Them untruth could lead to dichotomous thinking, seeing people as either all good or all bad. But how does that relate to trigger warnings?

Alternatively, if trigger warnings are based on the belief that exposure to certain material will inevitably cause harm, that might be fortune-telling because they're predicting a negative outcome without evidence.

Wait, another point from their argument is that trigger warnings can reinforce the idea that students are fragile. So, by issuing trigger warnings, educators might be promoting the belief that students can't handle certain content, which is a form of catastrophizing or fortune-telling about the students' ability to cope.

So, putting it all together, I think Lukianoff and Haidt argue that trigger warnings involve fortune-telling because they predict that certain content will cause harm without solid evidence and thus avoid it, which can prevent people from developing resilience.

Wait, but another possibility is that it's dichotomous thinking because trigger warnings categorize content as either safe or unsafe, with no nuance. That could be it too. Hmm.

I'm a bit torn between options A and C. Let me think about the definitions again. Dichotomous thinking is seeing things in extremes, like good or evil, black or white. If trigger warnings are applied based on a binary approach—assuming that any mention of a topic is either completely unsafe or fine—then that's dichotomous thinking.

Alternatively, fortune-telling is making a negative prediction about the future without evidence, like assuming that reading about a traumatic event will definitely cause someone distress.

Which one aligns more with their argument? I think they argue that trigger warnings are based on the idea that exposure to certain content will inevitably cause harm, which is a form of catastrophizing or fortune-telling. Because they're predicting that the content will trigger a negative reaction, hence the need for a warning. So that's like predicting the future negatively without solid evidence.

So the answer might be A: fortune-telling.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Maybe I should think about how they frame it in their book. They might say that trigger warnings encourage students to think that they can't handle certain material, which is a form of catastrophizing. Or perhaps it's more about emotional reasoning, but that's not one of the options here.

Alternatively, dichotomous thinking could apply if the approach is to label content as either triggering or not, without considering context or individual differences.

I'm a bit stuck. But I think the more likely answer is C: dichotomous thinking because it's about categorizing content as either safe or dangerous without considering the nuances. But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, another angle: Trigger warnings might lead to avoiding discussions under the assumption that any exposure is bad. This could be seen as all-or-nothing thinking, which is dichotomous. So that's C.

Alternatively, if they're assuming that the content will definitely cause harm, that's fortune-telling, which is A.

I think I'm going to go with C: dichotomous thinking, because trigger warnings imply a binary decision about whether content is safe or unsafe. So the answer is C.

Lukianoff and Haidt argue that trigger warnings involve a specific type of pathological thinking. They discuss how trigger warnings can reinforce harmful cognitive patterns, particularly in the context of the "three Great Untruths" they identify in their work. Trigger warnings often operate on the assumption that certain content is inherently harmful or unsafe, leading to a binary classification of material as either entirely safe or entirely dangerous. This aligns with the cognitive distortion of dichotomous thinking, where nuances and context are ignored in favor of extreme, all-or-nothing categories. While fortune-telling (predicting negative outcomes without evidence) could also apply, the more fitting description here is dichotomous thinking, as trigger warnings often reflect a black-and-white approach to content evaluation.
