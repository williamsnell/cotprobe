Question:

A man conveyed land by quitclaim deed as a gift to his cousin, who did not then record the deed or take possession of the land. Six months later, when the man was still in possession, he conveyed the land by quitclaim deed as a gift to a friend, who knew nothing of the deed to the cousin. The friend did not record his deed. The man then vacated the land, and the friend took possession. The recording act of the jurisdiction provides as follows: "No unrecorded conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value without notice, who shall first record." Recently, the cousin learned about the friend's deed and possession, immediately recorded her deed, and sued the friend for possession and to quiet title. The friend then recorded his deed and raised all available defenses. For whom is the court likely to decide?

Options:

A: For the friend, because the cousin did not take possession of the land.
B: For the friend, because the cousin did not record her deed in time.
C: For the cousin, because she has the original deed.
D: For the friend, because a subsequent good- faith donee has priority over a prior donee who fails to record.
E: For the cousin, because the friend failed to first record.
F: For the cousin, because the friend did not pay for the land.
G: For the cousin, because the man had already given the land away before giving it to the friend.
H: For the friend, because he was first in possession.
I: For the friend, because he was not aware of the previous deed.
J: For the cousin, because she was first in time and the friend was not a purchaser.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this property law question. Let me start by breaking down the facts.

A man gave land to his cousin using a quitclaim deed as a gift. Then, six months later, he gave the same land to his friend, also using a quitclaim deed. Neither the cousin nor the friend recorded their deeds initially. The cousin didn't take possession either. The friend didn't know about the cousin's deed. Later, the man left, and the friend took possession. 

Now, the cousin found out about the friend's deed and possession. She immediately recorded her deed and sued the friend. The friend then recorded his deed and raised all possible defenses. The question is, who will the court decide in favor of?

The recording act in the jurisdiction says: "No unrecorded conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value without notice, who shall first record." So I remember that recording acts can be notice, race, or race-notice types. The wording here sounds like a race-notice statute because it mentions subsequent purchasers without notice who first record.

Let me think about the types of recording acts. In a race-notice jurisdiction, to have priority, a purchaser must be without notice of earlier conveyances and must record first. But here, both the cousin and friend are donees, not purchasers for value. Hmm, that complicates things because the statute uses the term "purchasers for value."

So, the cousin got the deed first but didn't record. The friend, six months later, got his deed, but also didn't record initially. The cousin only recorded after she found out about the friend's deed. The friend recorded after being sued.

In a race-notice state, if someone is a bona fide purchaser (BFP) without notice who records first, they have priority over prior unrecorded interests. But since both are donees, not purchasers, maybe the BFP rules don't apply here. Wait, but the friend didn't pay value either; he's also a donee. So neither is a purchaser for value, which might mean the recording act doesn't apply to them, and the common law rule of "first in time" would apply.

At common law, the first deed is effective, and subsequent deeds don't override it unless there's estoppel or something. So the cousin, being first in time, would have the superior claim. But the problem is that she didn't record, and the friend didn't either. But since the recording act here requires being a subsequent purchaser for value without notice and who records first, it might not apply because neither paid value.

Wait, but the friend was without notice. But again, he's a donee, so maybe the recording act's protections don't apply to him. So the cousin's claim, being first, would take priority even if she didn't record because the friend isn't a BFP.

Wait, but the recording act says that an unrecorded conveyance isn't good against a subsequent purchaser for value without notice who records first. Since the friend isn't a purchaser for value, maybe the act doesn't protect him. So the cousin's deed, even unrecorded, would be valid against the friend because the friend isn't a BFP. So the cousin's right prevails.

Looking at the options: Option J says, "For the cousin, because she was first in time and the friend was not a purchaser." That seems to fit. Because the friend isn't a purchaser for value, the recording act doesn't apply, so first in time (cousin) wins.

Another option is B, which says the cousin didn't record in time. But if the recording act doesn't apply because the friend isn't a purchaser, then the cousin's deed being unrecorded doesn't matter against the friend. So B might not be the right reason.

Option G says the cousin because the man had already given the land away first. That's about first in time, which aligns with J and G. But J specifically addresses the friend not being a purchaser, which is why the recording act doesn't apply. So I think J is better.

So I'm leaning towards J being the correct answer.

The question revolves around a property dispute between a cousin and a friend, both of whom received quitclaim deeds from the same man at different times. The cousin received her deed first but did not record it or take possession. Six months later, the friend received his deed, also without recording it initially, and later took possession. The jurisdiction follows a race-notice recording act, which protects subsequent purchasers for value without notice who record first. However, neither the cousin nor the friend is a "purchaser for value," as both received the land as gifts.

Under the recording act, its protections apply only to subsequent purchasers for value without notice who record first. Since neither party paid value, the act does not apply, and the common law "first in time" rule governs. The cousin, having received her deed first, has priority over the friend, regardless of recording delays. The friend's lack of notice and subsequent possession do not override the cousin's earlier conveyance under these circumstances.

Option J correctly reflects this reasoning, as it emphasizes that the cousin was first in time and that the friend, not being a purchaser, does not benefit from the recording act's protections. Other options, such as B or G, either misapply the recording act or fail to address the key distinction that neither party was a purchaser for value.
