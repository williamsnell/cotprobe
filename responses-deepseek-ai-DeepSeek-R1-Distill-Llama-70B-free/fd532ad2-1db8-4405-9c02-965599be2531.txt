Okay, so I've got this insurance question here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think through it carefully. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about Mr. Norman Schwartz, who is 30 years old and wants a $15,000 insurance policy. The question has two parts. First, it asks about the difference in annual premiums between a 20-payment life policy and an ordinary life paid-up-at-65 policy. Second, if he dies at age 62, how much would he have paid in for each policy.

Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on the different types of life insurance policies. Let me recall. There's term life, whole life, and variations like ordinary life or paid-up policies. 

So, a 20-payment life policy probably means that the policyholder pays premiums for 20 years. After that, the policy is paid up, and he's covered for the rest of his life without paying more. An ordinary life paid-up-at-65 policy, I think, means that the policy is fully paid by the time he reaches 65, so he pays premiums until then, and after 65, it's paid up. 

Wait, but when he takes out the policy at 30, the paid-up-at-65 would mean he's paying annually until he's 65. That's 35 years of payments. Because from 30 to 65 is 35 years. But the 20-payment life policy would have him paying for 20 years, so until he's 50. 

So the first part is about the annual premiums for each policy. The difference between them. I'm not sure about the exact formulas, but I remember that the premium calculations depend on the number of payments and the present value of the death benefit.

The premium for a life insurance policy is calculated based on the present value of the future payments. The longer the payment period, the higher the total premiums paid, but the lower each annual premium might be because it's spread out over more years. Wait, no, actually, the longer you pay, the more you pay in total, but maybe the annual premium for an ordinary life (like whole life) is higher than for a limited pay policy. Because in limited pay, you're paying for a shorter period, so each premium is higher, but you stop paying after that period.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think. Suppose I have two policies: Policy A requires paying for 20 years, Policy B requires paying until 65 (35 years). Which policy has higher annual premiums?

Well, the present value of the death benefit is the same in both cases, right? Because the insurance company has to cover the same amount when the person dies, whenever that is. But the way premiums are structured depends on how many payments are made.

In a 20-payment life policy, the insured pays for 20 years. So the premium each year would be higher because it's only paid for 20 years. In the ordinary life (paid-up at 65), he's paying for 35 years, so each annual premium would be lower, but paid over a longer period.

Wait, no, I think I might have it backwards. Let me think again. The total amount paid into the policy would be higher for the longer payment term. But the annual premium for the 20-payment policy would be higher because you're paying off the policy faster. So, the difference in annual premiums is (annual premium of 20-pay) minus (annual premium of ordinary to 65). So the 20-pay's annual premium is higher.

But wait, the question is the difference between the two annual premiums. So if the 20-pay has higher annual premiums, the difference would be (20-pay premium) - (ordinary to 65 premium) = positive number.

But I'm not sure about the exact numbers. The question gives options from about $25 to $34. So I need to figure out the exact calculation.

I think the standard formula for the annual premium of a life insurance policy is based on the present value of the death benefit plus the present value of the future premiums. Wait, actually, for a whole life policy, the premium is calculated so that the present value of all future premiums equals the present value of the death benefit plus any dividends or other factors.

Alternatively, the premium can be calculated using the formula for the present value of an annuity. Because the insurance company is essentially receiving an annuity (series of payments) from the policyholder and will pay out a lump sum (the death benefit) when the policyholder dies.

Wait, but the actual calculation might involve more detailed actuarial tables, but for this question, perhaps we can assume a certain interest rate and use the present value formulas.

Wait, but I don't think the interest rate is given in the question. Hmm, that complicates things. Because without knowing the interest rate, I can't compute the exact present values.

Wait, the question doesn't provide the interest rate, so maybe I'm supposed to know some standard approach or perhaps the question expects me to use a different method. Alternatively, maybe this is a question that refers to a standard textbook problem, and perhaps the premiums are calculated using certain standard formulas.

Wait, I'm probably overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

The first part of the question is about the difference in annual premiums. The second part is about the total paid if he dies at 62.

So, let's tackle the second part first, because maybe that will help.

If he dies at 62, how much has he paid in each policy.

For the 20-payment policy: he started paying at 30, and pays for 20 years, which brings him to age 50. So from 30 to 50, 20 years. So if he dies at 62, he hasn't paid any premiums after 50. So the total paid would be 20 years of premiums.

For the ordinary life paid-up at 65: he pays until 65. So from 30 to 65 is 35 years. But if he dies at 62, he would have paid 32 years (from 30 to 62 is 32 years). Wait, 62 minus 30 is 32, so 32 annual payments.

Wait no, 30 to 62 inclusive? Let me calculate: age 30 is the first year, age 31 is the second, so age 62 is 62-30 = 32 years old? No, wait, that's not correct. Let's see, from 30 to 62 is 32 years because 62-30 =32, but since the first payment is made at age 30, that's the first year. So if he dies at 62, he would have made 32 payments. But the policy is paid-up at 65, meaning that he would have made 35 payments (from 30 to 65 inclusive, which is 35 years). So if he dies at 62, he's made 32 payments.

But wait, I'm not sure if the policy is designed such that if he dies before 65, the insurance company still requires the remaining payments. No, no, because the policy is paid-up at 65, which means that once he reaches 65, it's paid up. So between 30 and 65, he makes annual payments. If he dies before 65, say at 62, he would have made 32 payments (from 30 to 61 inclusive, since 62 is the year he dies). Wait, because when he dies in 62, he might have already paid the premium for that year. Or does the payment happen at the end of the year?

Ah, that's a detail that could matter. Typically, life insurance premiums are paid at the beginning of the period, so if he dies in 62, he would have made the payment for 62. So from 30 to 62 inclusive is 33 years. Wait, let me compute:

From age 30 to 62, inclusive, how many years is that? 62 minus 30 is 32, plus 1 equals 33 years. So he would have made 33 payments. Wait, no, because the first payment is at age 30, which is the first year, then 31 is the second, and so on until 62, which is the 33rd payment. So if he dies at 62, he would have paid 33 annual premiums for the ordinary policy.

Wait, but the policy is paid-up at 65, so if he dies at 62, he still would have made 33 payments. The policy would have been in force until 65, but he died at 62. So the total payments he made are 33 times the annual premium for the ordinary policy.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach this step by step.

For the 20-payment life policy:

- Pays premiums for 20 years, starting at 30, so until age 50.

- If he dies at 62, he has already stopped paying premiums at 50. So he has made 20 payments.

So total paid in is 20 * annual_premium_20pay.

For the ordinary life paid-up at 65:

- Pays from 30 to 65, which is 35 years.

- If he dies at 62, he has made payments from 30 to 62, which is 33 years.

So total paid in is 33 * annual_premium_ord.

So the question is, for each policy, how much would he have paid in total if he died at 62.

But the first part of the question is about the difference in annual premiums between the two policies. So annual_premium_20pay minus annual_premium_ord.

Now, to find the annual premiums, I think we can model each policy as an annuity due, where the present value of the premiums equals the present value of the death benefit.

The formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity (where payments are made at the end of each period) is:

PV = PMT * [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r

But since life insurance policies often have premiums paid at the beginning of the period, it's an annuity due, so the formula would be:

PV = PMT * [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r * (1 + r)

Alternatively, the present value can be calculated using the appropriate factors.

But without knowing the interest rate, I can't compute the exact numbers. Hmm. That's a problem because the question must have enough information to solve it. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the question is assuming that the premiums are calculated using the same mortality table and interest rate, and that the difference in annual premiums can be determined by the number of payment periods.

Alternatively, perhaps the premiums are based on the same total premium, but spread over different periods. But that doesn't make sense because the present value factors would change.

Wait, maybe the question is expecting me to know that the 20-payment policy's annual premium is higher than the ordinary life's annual premium. But by how much?

Alternatively, perhaps the difference is calculated as (20 * annual_20) - (35 * annual_ord) = 0, but that can't be because the present value would differ.

Wait, perhaps the two policies have the same death benefit, so their present values are equal. So the present value of 20 annual premiums equals the present value of 35 annual premiums, but that can't be because the number of payments is different.

Wait, no, the present value of the death benefit is the same for both policies. So the present value of the 20 payments (for the 20-pay policy) must equal the present value of the death benefit. Similarly, the present value of the 35 payments (for the ordinary policy) must also equal the present value of the death benefit. Therefore, the two present values of the payments are equal.

So, for the 20-pay policy:

PV_20 = annual_premium_20 * [1 - (1+r)^-20 ] / r

For the ordinary policy:

PV_35 = annual_premium_35 * [1 - (1+r)^-35 ] / r

Since both PV_20 and PV_35 equal the present value of the death benefit, which is the same for both policies, so:

annual_premium_20 * [1 - (1+r)^-20 ] / r = annual_premium_35 * [1 - (1+r)^-35 ] / r

The denominators are the same, so they cancel out. Therefore,

annual_premium_20 * [1 - (1+r)^-20 ] = annual_premium_35 * [1 - (1+r)^-35 ]

So, the ratio of the annual premiums is (1 - (1+r)^-35 ) / (1 - (1+r)^-20 )

But without knowing r, I can't compute the exact value. Hmm. So perhaps the answer is based on standard actuarial calculations, and the difference is one of the options given.

Alternatively, perhaps the question uses a different approach, maybe using the number of payments. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to the fact that the 20-payment policy has a shorter payment period, so the annual premium is higher. The difference would be the additional amount he pays each year in the 20-pay compared to the 35-pay.

But again, without knowing the interest rate or the exact formula used, it's hard to compute.

Wait, perhaps the answer is based on the idea that the 20-pay policy has higher annual premiums. The options given are in the range of around $25 to $34. So perhaps the difference is around $29.55 or similar.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the total premiums paid and compare.

Wait, the first part is the difference in annual premiums. The second part is total paid if he dies at 62.

Wait, perhaps I can work backward. Let's say he dies at 62. For the 20-pay policy, he's paid 20 years. For the ordinary policy, he's paid 33 years (from 30 to 62 inclusive, that's 33 payments). Wait, no, 62-30=32, but if he started at 30, then 30 is the first payment, 31 the second, ..., 62 would be the 33rd payment. So 33 payments.

So the total paid for 20-pay is 20 * P20.

The total for ordinary is 33 * P35.

But the present value of the death benefit is the same for both policies. So for the 20-pay, the present value of the 20 payments equals the present value of the death benefit. For the ordinary, the present value of 35 payments equals the same death benefit.

So, we can set up the equations:

P20 * (1 - (1 + r)^-20)/r = 15000 / (1 + r)^0 (assuming death at time 0? No, that's not right.)

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently.

The death benefit is $15,000. For the 20-pay policy, the policy is paid up after 20 payments, so the present value at time of issue (age 30) of the death benefit is equal to the present value of the 20 annual premiums.

Similarly, for the ordinary policy, the present value of the 35 annual premiums equals the present value of the death benefit.

So, for the 20-pay:

PV = P20 * [1 - (1 + r)^-20 ] / r = 15000

For the ordinary:

PV = P35 * [1 - (1 + r)^-35 ] / r = 15000

So, we can set the two expressions equal:

P20 * [1 - (1 + r)^-20 ] = P35 * [1 - (1 + r)^-35 ]

Therefore, P20 = P35 * [1 - (1 + r)^-35 ] / [1 - (1 + r)^-20 ]

So, the annual premium for the 20-pay is higher than that of the ordinary policy.

The difference in annual premiums is P20 - P35.

But without knowing r, I can't compute the exact value. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a 3% interest rate, or some standard rate. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is a standard value, and I can think of the approximate factors.

Alternatively, perhaps the difference in annual premiums is calculated using the formula where the 20-pay has a certain multiple of the ordinary policy.

Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the difference in annual premiums is based on the number of payments. But that's not directly applicable.

Wait, let me think about the total premiums paid.

For the 20-pay, total paid is 20 * P20.

For the ordinary, if he lives to 65, it's 35 * P35.

But since both policies have the same death benefit, the present value of the death benefit equals the present value of the premiums.

So, 15000 = P20 * [1 - (1 + r)^-20 ] / r

Similarly,

15000 = P35 * [1 - (1 + r)^-35 ] / r

So, P20 = 15000 * r / [1 - (1 + r)^-20 ]

P35 = 15000 * r / [1 - (1 + r)^-35 ]

So the difference in annual premiums is P20 - P35 = 15000 r [ 1/(1 - (1+r)^-20 ) - 1/(1 - (1 + r)^-35 ) ]

But without knowing r, I can't compute this.

Wait, maybe the question expects me to know the standard premium difference. Alternatively, perhaps it's testing the understanding that the 20-pay policy has higher annual premiums, but the exact difference isn't calculable without more info. But the question gives options, so perhaps it's based on a 3% interest rate.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a question about term life vs whole life, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the 20-pay policy is a type of whole life where you pay for 20 years, and then it's paid up, whereas the ordinary life is a whole life where you pay until 65.

The annual premiums for the 20-pay would be higher because you're paying off the policy faster. So, the difference would be the extra amount per year.

But without knowing the exact factors, I can't compute the exact difference.

Wait, perhaps the difference is (20/35) of the premium, but that doesn't make sense because it's about present value.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the present value factors. Let's assume an interest rate of, say, 3% (I've seen that used in some examples).

So, let's compute the present value factors.

For 20 years:

The annuity factor is [1 - (1.03)^-20 ] / 0.03

Compute (1.03)^-20: approximately 0.5537

So 1 - 0.5537 = 0.4463

Divide by 0.03: 0.4463 / 0.03 ≈14.8767

So P20 = 150
