Question:

A city imposes a municipal excise tax of $200 per year on commercial photographic studios in the city. It also imposes an excise tax of $100 per year on every itinerant commercial photographer for the privilege of using the streets and sidewalks. A credit is allowed against this latter tax for any excise tax paid to the city by the photographer or his employer in respect to the maintenance of a photographic studio in the city. In an action by a studio located in the city challenging the constitutionality of the $200 per year excise tax, the court will most likely declare the tax

Options:

A: unconstitutional, as an undue burden on interstate commerce.
B: unconstitutional, as a discriminatory tax on the privilege of doing business within the state.
C: constitutional, as it is within the city's rights to tax local businesses.
D: unconstitutional, as it infringes on the rights of local businesses.
E: constitutional, as it is a fair method of raising municipal revenue.
F: unconstitutional, as it is a form of double taxation.
G: constitutional, as within the powers of the state to tax the instruments of interstate commerce.
H: constitutional, as it is a reasonable exercise of the city's taxing power.
I: unconstitutional, as it unfairly targets a specific profession.
J: constitutional, as a nondiscriminatory license tax.

Okay, so I've got this question about municipal taxes and their constitutionality. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The scenario is a city imposing two different excise taxes. The first is a $200 per year tax on commercial photographic studios within the city. The second is a $100 per year tax on itinerant commercial photographers for using the streets and sidewalks. But there's a credit allowed against this latter tax if the photographer or their employer has already paid the studio tax. 

The question is about a studio challenging the $200 tax. The options are about whether the court will find this tax constitutional or not, and why.

Hmm, I remember that taxes imposed by cities must comply with both state laws and the U.S. Constitution. The main constitutional issues usually revolve around things like equal protection, due process, and commerce clause challenges.

So, the studio is located in the city, so it's a local business. The tax is imposed on the studio, which is a local business, not on someone from out of state. So, if the tax is the same for all similar businesses, it shouldn't be a problem under the commerce clause. But wait, I should think about what the tax is on. It's an excise tax, which is a tax imposed on the privilege of conducting business, right?

I recall that the Supreme Court has dealt with cases where states or cities impose taxes that might burden interstate commerce. For example, in cases where a state taxes out-of-state companies more heavily than in-state ones, that could be a problem. But here, the tax is on local studios, not on out-of-state ones, so that might not apply.

Wait, but there's another angle: itinerant photographers. They pay $100 but can get a credit if they've paid the studio tax. So if an itinerant photographer works from a studio in the city, maybe they don't have to pay the $100 because they already paid the $200 through their employer. But if they're just visiting and don't have a studio, they pay the $100.

So the tax seems to apply differently based on whether you're a studio or an itinerant photographer. But the studio is challenging their own tax, the $200. So the issue is whether the $200 tax is constitutional.

Looking at the options, some options talk about interstate commerce, others about being discriminatory or double taxation. Let's go through each possibility.

Option A: Unconstitutional as an undue burden on interstate commerce. But wait, the studio is a local business, not necessarily involved in interstate commerce. Unless the photographers serve interstate clients, but the tax applies regardless. But I think the commerce clause is more about not impeding the flow of commerce between states, so if the tax is applied evenhandedly to all, it's probably okay. 

Option B: Unconstitutional as a discriminatory tax on the privilege of doing business. Discriminatory against whom? If it's applied equally to all photographers, maybe not. Or perhaps it's treating in-state and out-of-state differently, but I don't see that here. The tax is on the studio, which is local.

Option C: Constitutional, as within the city's rights to tax local businesses. Cities do have the authority to impose taxes on businesses operating within their jurisdiction, as long as they're not violating any constitutional provisions.

Option D: Unconstitutional, infringing on local businesses' rights. But I don't think cities are prohibited from taxing local businesses; in fact, that's a common practice.

Option E: Constitutional as a fair method. Fairness is subjective, but the question is about constitutionality, not policy.

Option F: Unconstitutional as double taxation. Wait, the itinerant photographers get a credit if they've paid the studio tax. So if a photographer works for a studio, they don't have to pay the $100 because their employer already paid the $200. So the same income isn't taxed twice. But the question is about the studio's tax, not the individual's. So the studio's $200 isn't being taxed again elsewhere, so double taxation might not apply here.

Option G: Constitutional, as within state's power to tax instruments of interstate commerce. But again, the studio is local, so unless their activities involve interstate commerce, which isn't specified, this might not be the right reason.

Option H: Constitutional as a reasonable exercise of taxing power. Cities have broad authority to tax for municipal purposes, as long as it's reasonable and doesn't violate constitutional protections.

Option I: Unconstitutional, unfairly targeting a specific profession. Photographic studios are a specific group, but cities can impose taxes on specific businesses as long as it's not arbitrary or discriminatory in a constitutional sense. So a tax on photographers might be okay if it's a valid exercise of the taxing power.

Option J: Constitutional as a nondiscriminatory license tax. So if the tax is applied equally to all similar businesses without favoring in-state or out-of-state, it's acceptable.

Wait, but the tax here is on commercial photographic studios. So it's a specific type of business. But cities can tax specific businesses as part of their revenue measures. As long as the tax doesn't discriminate against interstate commerce or other constitutional issues, it's okay.

So the studio is arguing that their $200 tax is unconstitutional. The likely challenge would be whether the tax is lawful under the state's taxing authority and the Constitution.

I think the key here is that the tax is a legitimate exercise of the city's taxing power. It's not a tax that's applied in a way that discriminates against interstate commerce because it's applied to local businesses. There's no indication that out-of-state photographers are treated differently in the studio tax. 

Wait, but the itinerant photographers' tax is $100, but if they're from out of state and don't have a studio in the city, they pay the $100. Does that mean that the city is imposing a higher tax on local studios compared to itinerant ones? No, because the itinerant ones only pay $100, but if they have a studio, they get a credit. So maybe the total for an itinerant with a studio is $200 (studio) and $0 (individual), whereas an itinerant without a studio pays $100. But the studio itself is paying $200 regardless.

Wait, but that's not the issue in the question. The studio is challenging the $200 tax. So the studio's tax is separate from the itinerant tax. 

So the court would likely look at whether the $200 tax is a valid exercise of the city's taxing authority. Since the tax is imposed on a local business, and there's no indication that it's being applied in a way that's discriminatory against interstate commerce, the tax should be constitutional. 

So looking at the options, options C, E, H, and J suggest constitutionality. The question is which reasoning is correct.

Option C says it's within the city's rights to tax local businesses. That makes sense because municipalities have the power to tax businesses operating within their jurisdictions.

Option H says it's a reasonable exercise, which is also a possible correct reasoning.

But the question is about the most likely reason the court would declare the tax unconstitutional or not. Since the options include both possibilities, I need to figure out which one applies.

Wait, another angle: the tax might be considered a license tax. In some cases, the Supreme Court has held that a license tax that applies to both in-state and out-of-state businesses can be valid if it's nondiscriminatory. For example, in the case of a license tax on drummers (traveling salesmen), the court held that such taxes are permissible as long as they don't discriminate against interstate commerce.

If the tax here is a license tax on the privilege of doing business, and it's applied equally to all photographers (whether from in-state or out-of-state), then it would be constitutional as a nondiscriminatory license tax. That would make option J correct.

Wait, but the tax in question is on the studio, not on the itinerant photographers. The studio is a local business, so the tax is on a local establishment. So perhaps option J is more about the itinerant tax, but in this case, the studio tax is being challenged.

Alternatively, perhaps the tax is a form of double taxation if the same activity is being taxed both at the studio level and the individual level. But the credit is allowed, so if the individual is affiliated with a studio, they don't pay. So the same income isn't taxed twice. Therefore, double taxation isn't an issue here.

So going back, the tax on the studio is a straightforward excise tax on the business. Cities can impose such taxes as part of their revenue measures. So the most likely reason the court would uphold it is that it's a constitutional exercise of the city's taxing power, making options C, E, H, or J correct.

Option J says it's a nondiscriminatory license tax. If the tax is a license tax and applies equally, then it's constitutional. But the question is about an excise tax, not a license tax. Or perhaps they're using excise tax interchangeably with license tax. 

Alternatively, the court could reason that the tax is a valid exercise of the city's power under the state's taxing authority. So option H says it's a reasonable exercise of the city's taxing power.

I think the correct answer is J: constitutional as a nondiscriminatory license tax. Because even though the term used is excise tax, the reasoning would treat it as a license tax. Alternatively, option C is about the city's right to tax local businesses.

Wait, but the tax is a flat $200 per year on the studio. That's more like an annual license fee, which is a type of excise tax. So the court would likely find it constitutional as a valid license tax that's nondiscriminatory.

So I'm leaning towards option J.
</think>

The question involves a city imposing a $200 annual excise tax on commercial photographic studios and a $100 annual tax on itinerant commercial photographers, with a credit allowed against the latter tax for studio taxes paid. A studio challenges the constitutionality of the $200 tax. The analysis focuses on whether the tax violates constitutional principles such as interstate commerce protections, equal protection, or double taxation.

The studio is a local business, and the tax is imposed on the privilege of operating within the city. Municipalities have broad authority to tax local businesses as long as the tax is reasonable and nondiscriminatory. The tax does not appear to burden interstate commerce, as it applies evenly to all studios regardless of their clientele. Additionally, the credit provision prevents double taxation, ensuring that photographers affiliated with a studio are not taxed twice.

Key considerations include:

1. **Interstate Commerce**: The tax does not disproportionately affect out-of-state businesses, so it does not violate the commerce clause.
2. **Double Taxation**: The credit for itinerant photographers ensures that the same activity is not taxed twice, avoiding double taxation concerns.
3. **Nondiscrimination**: The tax applies equally to all studios, making it nondiscriminatory and a valid exercise of the city's taxing power.

The most likely reasoning is that the tax is constitutional as a nondiscriminatory license tax, which aligns with the city's authority to impose such taxes on local businesses.
