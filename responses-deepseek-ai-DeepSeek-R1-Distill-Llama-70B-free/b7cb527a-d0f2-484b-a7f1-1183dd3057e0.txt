Okay, so I've got this question here asking which number is a multiple of 7. The options are labeled from A to J, each with a different number. I need to figure out which one is divisible by 7. 

Hmm, I remember that a multiple of 7 is any number that can be expressed as 7 times an integer. So basically, when you divide the number by 7, there's no remainder. But how do I check each of these options quickly?

Well, one way is to divide each number by 7 and see if it comes out evenly. But that might take a while since there are ten options. Maybe there's a faster method. Oh wait, I think there's a trick for checking divisibility by 7. Let me try to recall it.

From what I remember, the rule isn't as straightforward as the one for 3 or 9, where you sum the digits. For 7, the method involves doubling the last digit and subtracting it from the rest of the number. Let me see if I can apply that.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: 27. Let's apply the rule. Take the last digit, which is 7, double it to get 14. Subtract that from the remaining part, which is 2. So 2 - 14 equals -12. Now, is -12 divisible by 7? Well, 7 times 2 is 14, which is bigger than 12, so no. So 27 isn't a multiple of 7.

Option B: 74. Last digit is 4. Double it to 8. Remaining part is 7. So 7 - 8 = -1. Not divisible by 7.

Option C: 56. Let's apply the rule. Last digit is 6, double is 12. Remaining part is 5. So 5 - 12 = -7. Oh, wait, -7 is divisible by 7 because 7 times -1 is -7. That means 56 is a multiple of 7. But let me check the other options just to be sure.

Option D: 83. Last digit 3, double is 6. Remaining part 8. 8-6=2. Not divisible by 7.

Option E: 111. Last digit 1, double is 2. Remaining part 11. 11-2=9. 9 isn't divisible by 7.

Option F: 61. Last digit 1, double is 2. Remaining part 6. 6-2=4. Not divisible by 7.

Option G: 48. Last digit 8, double is 16. Remaining 4. 4-16= -12. Not divisible by 7.

Option H: 102. Last digit 2, double is 4. Remaining part 10. 10-4=6. Not divisible by 7.

Option I: 94. Last digit 4, double is 8. Remaining part 9. 9-8=1. Not divisible.

Option J: 75. Last digit 5, double is 10. Remaining part 7. 7-10= -3. Not divisible.

So from all the options, only option C (56) works. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I should try dividing 56 by 7. 7 times 8 is 56. Yep, that checks out. So 56 is definitely a multiple of 7.

I think that's the correct answer. So the correct choice is option C.

The number 56 is a multiple of 7 because when divided by 7, it equals 8 exactly with no remainder.

Answer: C
