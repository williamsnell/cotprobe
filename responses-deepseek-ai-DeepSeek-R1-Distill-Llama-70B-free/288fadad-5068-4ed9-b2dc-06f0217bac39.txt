Okay, so I've got this question about moral theories, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. The question is asking which moral theory is centrally concerned with the idea of "using someone as a mere means." The options are from A to J, each representing a different theory.

Hmm, I remember that different moral theories focus on different aspects. Let me think about each option and what I know about them.

Option A is Utilitarianism. From what I recall, Utilitarianism is all about maximizing overall happiness or utility. The main idea is the greatest good for the greatest number. So, actions are right if they promote the most happiness. But does it specifically talk about using people as a means? I'm not sure. I think Utilitarianism might sometimes allow using people if it leads to a greater good, but I'm not certain if that's a central concept for them.

Option B is Kantianism. Oh right, Immanuel Kant's theories. One of his key points is the Categorical Imperative. I remember he said something about treating people as ends in themselves and not merely as means to an end. So, Kantian ethics really emphasizes that we shouldn't use others just for our own purposes without considering their own value. This seems to directly relate to the idea in the question.

Option C is Egoism. Egoism is about self-interest, right? The idea that individuals should act in their own self-interest. But how does that relate to using others as a means? I guess egoists might use others to achieve their own ends, but I don't think the theory itself is centered on that concept. It's more about self-interest being the moral goal.

Option D is Existentialism. Existentialists focus on individual freedom and choice. They don't really have a set of rules, so I don't think they specifically address using others as means. It's more about personal responsibility and authentic existence.

Option E is Natural Law Theory. This theory is based on the idea that there's a moral law inherent in nature, often linked to religion or human reason. I don't specifically remember natural law being focused on the concept of using people as means. It's more about right and wrong based on natural order.

Option F is Virtue Ethics. Virtue Ethics focuses on the character of the person, like virtues such as honesty or compassion. It's about being a good person rather than specific actions. So, the idea of using others as a means might relate to virtues like respect or kindness, but I don't think it's a central tenet of the theory.

Option G is Relativism. That's the idea that moral judgments are relative to cultural or personal perspectives. So, there's no universal right or wrong. Again, I don't think Relativism specifically addresses the concept of using others as a means; it's more about varying moral standards.

Option H is Divine Command Theory. This theory holds that actions are right if they align with divine commands, like those from God. The focus is on following God's will, not specifically on how people are treated as means or ends.

Option I is Hedonism. Hedonism is about pursuing pleasure and avoiding pain. It's similar to Utilitarianism in that sense, but again, I don't recall it focusing on the issue of using others as a means. It's more about the outcomes related to pleasure.

Option J is Consequentialism. This is a broader category that includes Utilitarianism. Consequentialist theories judge actions based on their outcomes. So, like Utilitarianism, they might justify using someone as a means if it leads to a better outcome overall, but I'm not sure if it's a central tenet. It's more about consequences than the treatment of individuals as means.

Putting it all together, the concept of treating people as ends and not mere means is a cornerstone of Kantian ethics. Kant's Categorical Imperative explicitly addresses this, making it a central aspect of his theory. The other options either don't focus on this idea or address it only tangentially.

The idea of "using someone as a mere means" is most centrally relevant to Kantianism. Immanuel Kant's moral philosophy, particularly through the Categorical Imperative, explicitly emphasizes treating individuals as ends in themselves rather than mere means to an end. This principle is a cornerstone of Kantian ethics, distinguishing it from other moral theories that may address the concept only tangentially or not at all. 

In contrast, Utilitarianism and Consequentialism focus on outcomes and may justify using individuals as means if it leads to a greater good, but this is not a central tenet. Egoism, Existentialism, Natural Law Theory, Virtue Ethics, Relativism, Divine Command Theory, and Hedonism each prioritize other aspects of morality, such as self-interest, individual freedom, natural order, character, cultural variation, divine will, or pleasure, respectively, without centrally addressing the specific issue of using others as mere means.
