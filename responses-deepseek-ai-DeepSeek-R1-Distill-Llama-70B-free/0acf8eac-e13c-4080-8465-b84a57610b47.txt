Question:

An experiment is to be conducted to determine whether taking fish oil capsules or garlic capsules has more of an effect on cholesterol levels. In past studies it was noted that daily exercise intensity (low, moderate, high) is associated with cholesterol level, but average sleep length (< 5, 5 - 8, > 8 hours) is not associated with cholesterol level. This experiment should be done

Options:

A: by blocking on sleep length
B: by blocking on gender
C: by blocking on diet
D: by blocking on previous medical conditions
E: by blocking on capsule type
F: by blocking on cholesterol level
G: by blocking on lifestyle habits
H: by blocking on exercise intensity
I: by blocking on age
J: by blocking on weight

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about an experiment involving fish oil and garlic capsules and their effect on cholesterol levels. I'm a bit new to experimental design, but I'll try to work through this step by step.

The question says that past studies found that daily exercise intensity—like low, moderate, or high—is associated with cholesterol levels. But average sleep length, whether it's less than 5, 5-8, or more than 8 hours, isn't linked to cholesterol. So the experiment is about seeing whether fish oil or garlic has a bigger impact on cholesterol.

The options are about what the experiment should be blocked on. Blocking is a concept I remember from stats class. Blocking is used to account for variables that might affect the outcome so that you can reduce variation within each group. The idea is to group subjects with similar characteristics together, so each block contains similar individuals, making the experiment more efficient.

So the key here is to identify which variables are known to affect the outcome, which in this case is cholesterol level. The question tells us that exercise intensity is associated with cholesterol, while sleep length is not. So the variable that matters here is exercise intensity. Therefore, blocking should be done on this variable to control for its effect.

Looking at the options, option H is "by blocking on exercise intensity." That makes sense because it's a variable that can influence cholesterol levels. If we block by exercise intensity, each block would have participants with the same exercise level, ensuring that the experiment's results are more about the treatment (fish oil or garlic) and not confounded by varying exercise habits.

Other options don't seem relevant. For example, blocking on sleep (option A) isn't necessary because past studies showed it doesn't affect cholesterol. Blocking on gender (B), diet (C), etc., aren't mentioned as factors related to cholesterol in this context. The question specifically points out that exercise intensity is a factor, so that's the one to block on.

The experiment should be conducted by blocking on a variable known to affect the outcome. Since exercise intensity is associated with cholesterol levels, blocking on this factor ensures that its influence is controlled, allowing the study to focus on the effects of fish oil and garlic capsules.

Answer: H
