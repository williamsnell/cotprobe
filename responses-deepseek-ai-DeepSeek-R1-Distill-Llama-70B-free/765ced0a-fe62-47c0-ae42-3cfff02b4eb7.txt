Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this problem about electric charge and electrons. The question says an object carries a charge of -1 Coulomb, and I need to find out how many excess electrons it contains. The options are given from A to J, and I have to choose the correct one.

Hmm, right. I remember that electrons carry a negative charge. So if an object has a negative charge, it means it has gained electrons. Each electron has a charge of about -1.6 x 10^-19 Coulombs. Oh wait, so the total charge is the number of electrons multiplied by the charge per electron.

Let me think about the formula. The total charge (Q) is equal to the number of electrons (n) times the charge of one electron (e). So Q = n * e. I need to solve for n here.

The given charge is -1 C. But since I'm looking for the number of electrons, the negative sign just tells me it's electrons and not protons, so I can ignore the sign for calculation purposes and focus on the magnitude.

So rearranging the formula, n = Q / e. Plugging in the numbers, n = 1 C / (1.6 x 10^-19 C per electron).

Wait, let me calculate that. 1 divided by 1.6e-19. So 1 / 1.6 is 0.625, and then we have to account for the exponent. So 0.625 times 1e19, right?

Wait, 1 divided by 1.6 is 0.625, so 0.625e19. Because 1e19 divided by 1.6 is (1/1.6)*1e19.

So 0.625e19 is the same as 6.25 x 10^18 electrons. Oh, because 0.625 is 6.25 x 10^-1. So when you multiply by 1e19, it's 6.25 x 10^18.

Looking at the options, option D is 6.25 × 10^18. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, just making sure I didn't mix up anything. Charge is -1 C, so the number of electrons is the charge divided by the charge per electron. Yes, so 1 / 1.6e-19 = 6.25e18. Yep, that makes sense.

To determine how many excess electrons correspond to a charge of –1 C, we use the relationship between charge and the number of electrons. Each electron carries a charge of approximately \( e = -1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \). The total charge \( Q \) is related to the number of electrons \( n \) by the formula:

\[
Q = n \cdot e
\]

Rearranging for \( n \):

\[
n = \frac{Q}{e}
\]

Substituting \( Q = 1 \, \text{C} \) (ignoring the negative sign for calculation purposes) and \( e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \):

\[
n = \frac{1}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}} = 0.625 \times 10^{19} = 6.25 \times 10^{18}
\]

Thus, the object contains \( 6.25 \times 10^{18} \) excess electrons. Comparing this result to the given options, the correct answer is:

**D: \( 6.25 \times 10^{18} \)**
