Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, Angela is single, not a head of household, and she claims one exemption. She earned $9,357, and $1,397 was withheld as federal tax. She's taking the standard deduction. I need to calculate how much additional tax she must pay.

First, I think I need to determine her taxable income. Since she's taking the standard deduction, I should look up the standard deduction for a single person. Wait, what's the standard deduction for single filers? I remember that for recent years it's been around $12,950, but maybe that's for 2022 or 2023. Oh wait, the question says using the table for standard deductions, but I don't have the exact table here. Hmm, maybe I should proceed with the standard deduction for single filers claiming one exemption.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The standard deduction is a fixed amount based on filing status, right? For single filers, I think the standard deduction is $12,950 for 2023, but maybe it's lower for the year in question. Wait, the question doesn't specify the year, so maybe I should assume the latest or a standard value. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to know that the standard deduction is, say, $12,000 or similar.

Wait, no, the standard deduction for single filers in recent years is higher. Let me think: in 2022, it was $12,950. So assuming that's the case, her standard deduction would be $12,950. But wait, she's claiming one exemption. Oh wait, the personal exemption was eliminated a few years back, right? Or maybe not. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) suspended personal exemptions from 2018 to 2025, so she can't claim a personal exemption anymore. Wait, but the question says she claims one exemption. Hmm, maybe that's a dependent exemption, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps the question is using an older tax system where personal exemptions are allowed.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's proceed. So, her total income is $9,357. She takes the standard deduction, so her taxable income would be her income minus the standard deduction. But wait, if the standard deduction is higher than her income, her taxable income would be zero. Let me check: if the standard deduction is $12,950 and she made $9,357, then 9,357 minus 12,950 is negative, so taxable income is zero. If her taxable income is zero, her tax liability would be zero. Because she doesn't owe any tax beyond what's been withheld.

But wait, she had $1,397 withheld. If her tax is zero, then she might be due a refund. But the question is asking how much additional tax she must pay. So if her tax is zero and she's had more withheld, she doesn't owe anything; she might get a refund. So the additional tax would be zero.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm calculating this correctly. Let me outline the steps:

1. Determine filing status: single, not head of household.
2. Calculate Adjusted Gross Income (AGI): $9,357.
3. Subtract standard deduction: for single filers, let's say $12,950. So AGI - standard deduction = 9,357 - 12,950 = negative, so taxable income is $0.
4. Calculate tax: If taxable income is $0, then tax owed is $0.
5. Compare with amount withheld ($1,397). Since $1,397 was withheld and tax owed is $0, she doesn't owe anything. So additional tax is $0.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think about exemptions again. But if personal exemptions are not allowed (due to TCJA), then it doesn't matter. Or perhaps the question is using older rules where personal exemptions are allowed. Let's consider that possibility.

If she can claim one exemption, perhaps that reduces her taxable income further. So, for example, if the exemption is $4,300 (which was the amount before TCJA), then her taxable income would be 9,357 - 12,950 (standard deduction) - 4,300 (exemption) = negative, so still zero. So her tax would still be zero.

Wait, but I'm not sure if she can claim an exemption in the current tax system. Since TCJA suspended personal exemptions, she can't claim a personal exemption for herself, unless she has dependents. But the question says she's single and not a head of household, so probably no dependents. So she can't claim any exemptions beyond her own, which isn't allowed now.

So, her taxable income is zero, tax is zero. She had $1,397 withheld, so she's due a refund. Therefore, she doesn't owe any additional tax.

So the answer should be B: $0 (No additional tax due).

Angela Rodriguez is single, not a head of household, and claims one exemption. She earned $9,357 during the year, with $1,397 withheld as federal tax. She is taking the standard deduction. To determine how much additional tax she must pay, the following steps are considered:

1. **Filing Status and Standard Deduction**: As a single filer, the standard deduction for recent years (e.g., 2022 or 2023) is $12,950. This amount is higher than her income of $9,357, so her taxable income is reduced to $0 after applying the standard deduction.

2. **Tax Liability**: With taxable income of $0, her federal tax liability is also $0. This is because no tax is owed on a taxable income of $0.

3. **Withholding and Refund**: Angela had $1,397 withheld during the year. Since her tax liability is $0, she does not owe any additional tax. Instead, she is entitled to a refund for the amount withheld.

4. **Exemptions**: While Angela claims one exemption, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) suspended personal exemptions from 2018 to 2025. Therefore, she cannot claim a personal exemption for herself, and there is no indication she has dependents to claim an exemption for. This does not affect her taxable income in this scenario.

Since her tax liability is $0 and no additional tax is owed, the correct answer is:

**B: $0 (No additional tax due)**

Answer: B
