Okay, so I've got this analogy question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is: "Vision is to hearing as..." and then I have to choose the correct option from A to J, which are all pairs of brain lobes.

Hmm, analogies often involve matching relationships. So I need to understand the relationship between the first pair, "Vision is to hearing," and then find the corresponding pair in the options.

Let me think about what each part stands for. Vision relates to sight, and hearing relates to sound. So, in terms of the brain, where are these functions primarily processed?

I remember that the occipital lobe is responsible for processing visual information. Yeah, that's right. So vision is mainly handled by the occipital lobe.

Hearing, on the other hand, is processed in the temporal lobe. Specifically, the temporal lobes have the primary auditory cortex, which deals with sound processing. So hearing is linked to the temporal lobe.

So the analogy is vision (occipital) to hearing (temporal). Now I'm looking for an option that pairs occipital with temporal in that order.

Looking at the options:

A: parietal to frontal. No, that's not right.

B: temporal to parietal. Wait, that's the reverse of what I need. Vision is to hearing, so occipital to temporal. So if the first part is vision (occipital), the second should be hearing (temporal). So the first blank is occipital, the second is temporal.

Looking through the options, the correct analogy should be "occipital lobe is to temporal lobe."

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option G: occipital lobe is to temporal lobe. Yes, that's exactly what I'm looking for.

So the correct completion would be "Vision is to hearing as occipital lobe is to temporal lobe." So the answer is G.

The question asks to complete the analogy "Vision is to hearing as" with the correct pair of brain lobes. Vision is processed in the occipital lobe, while hearing is processed in the temporal lobe. Therefore, the correct analogy is "occipital lobe is to temporal lobe."

G: occipital lobe is to temporal lobe.

Answer: G
