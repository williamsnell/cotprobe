Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about AIDA. I remember AIDA is an acronym used in marketing, right? But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact words it stands for. Let me think.

AIDA stands for four steps that a consumer goes through when making a purchase. The first one is definitely Awareness. I'm pretty sure that's the A. So the question has blanks for the other three letters.

The options are from A to J, each with two words. The question is asking for the second and fourth blanks. Wait, no, the question says the last character is the letter I have to choose. Wait, the question is: AIDA stands for awareness, ________, desire and _________. Wait, that's four words. Oh, because it's a four-letter acronym, so each word corresponds to a letter.

So A is Awareness, I is Interest, D is Desire, A is Action. So the blanks are the second and fourth. So the second word is Interest, and the fourth is Action.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option J: Interest; action. Oh, that fits. So the second blank is Interest, fourth is Action.

Wait, but let me double-check. I might be mixing it up with another acronym. Sometimes I get confused between AIDA and other models. AIDA is Awareness, Interest, Desire, Action. Yeah, that's right.

So the question is asking for the second and fourth words. The first blank is the I, which is Interest, and the last is A, which is Action.

So looking at the options, option J says Interest; action. So that's the correct choice.
