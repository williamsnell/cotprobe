Okay, I'm trying to figure out which of these options is NOT a centripetal force in a state. Centripetal forces are those that unify a country and bring its people together, right? So, I need to go through each option and see which one doesn't fit that description.

Option A: A shared national language. I remember that a common language helps people communicate and feel part of the same nation, so that's definitely a centripetal force.

Option B: Existence of strong separatist groups. Wait, separatists want to split away from the country, right? That's the opposite of centripetal; that's centrifugal because it divides the nation. So this might be the answer, but I'll check the others to be sure.

Option C: The national anthem. That's a national symbol, which unites people, so centripetal.

Option D: High rates of internal migration. Hmm, when people move around within the country, they might spread cultural practices and mix populations, which can strengthen unity. So that's centripetal.

Option E: National transportation networks. Good roads and railways connect different regions, making it easier for people to travel and conduct business. That definitely unifies the country, so centripetal.

Option F: A diverse cultural heritage. Wait, diversity might lead to divisions if different groups don't feel included. But sometimes, celebrating diversity can also promote unity. I'm a bit confused here. Maybe it's more about how the state handles it. If the state promotes a single culture, that's centripetal, but diversity itself could be neutral or even centrifugal if not managed well. But I'm not sure if this is the answer because the question is about which is NOT centripetal.

Option G: National education system. This teaches a common curriculum, often including national history and values, which unites people. Definitely centripetal.

Option H: High level of confidence in the central government. If people trust their government, they're more likely to support it, so that's centripetal.

Option I: A strong national military. A military can protect the country and symbolize strength, which can unite people, so centripetal.

So, looking back, Option B is about separatist groups, which push for division, making them a centrifugal force. That's the opposite of centripetal. So the correct answer is B.

The correct answer is B. 

A centripetal force unifies a state, while a centrifugal force divides it. A shared national language, national anthem, internal migration, transportation networks, national education, confidence in government, and a strong military all promote unity. However, strong separatist groups seek to split the state, making them a centrifugal force, not centripetal.

Answer: B
