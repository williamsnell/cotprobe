Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to compute the gradient of a function f in cylindrical coordinates. The function is given as f(x,y,z) = z/(x² + y²). Hmm, I remember that in cylindrical coordinates, x is ρ cosθ, y is ρ sinθ, and z stays the same. So first, maybe I should express f in terms of cylindrical coordinates.

Let me write that down. Since x² + y² is ρ², the function f becomes z/(ρ²). So f(ρ,θ,z) = z/(ρ²). Now, I need to find the gradient of f in cylindrical coordinates. The gradient in cylindricals is given by the gradient in terms of the unit vectors u_ρ, u_θ, u_z. The formula for the gradient is:

∇f = (∂f/∂ρ) u_ρ + (1/ρ ∂f/∂θ) u_θ + (∂f/∂z) u_z.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait a second. I think the gradient in cylindrical coordinates is a bit different. Let me think again. Oh right, for a function f(ρ,θ,z), the gradient ∇f is:

( ∂f/∂ρ ) u_ρ + ( (1/ρ) ∂f/∂θ ) u_θ + ( ∂f/∂z ) u_z.

Okay, so I need to compute the three partial derivatives: ∂f/∂ρ, ∂f/∂θ, and ∂f/∂z.

Let's compute each partial derivative.

First, ∂f/∂ρ. Since f = z/(ρ²), the derivative with respect to ρ is using the power rule. So d/dρ (z/ρ²) = z * d/dρ (ρ⁻²) = z * (-2) ρ⁻³ = -2 z / ρ³.

Next, ∂f/∂θ. Looking at f, it's z/(ρ²), and neither z nor ρ depends on θ. Because ρ is sqrt(x² + y²), which doesn't involve θ once expressed in cylindricals. So ∂f/∂θ is zero. So the term involving u_θ will be zero.

Then, ∂f/∂z. That's straightforward. The derivative of z/(ρ²) with respect to z is 1/(ρ²).

Putting these together, the gradient becomes:

∇f = [ -2z / ρ³ ] u_ρ + [ (1/ρ) * 0 ] u_θ + [ 1/(ρ²) ] u_z.

Simplifying, since the middle term is zero, we get:

∇f = (-2z/ρ³) u_ρ + (1/ρ²) u_z.

Now, looking at the options provided.

Option C is - (2z / ρ³) u_ρ + (1 / ρ) u_z. Wait, no, because the third term in my calculation is 1/ρ², but option C has 1/ρ. So that doesn't match.

Option G is - (2z / ρ³) u_ρ + (1 / ρ²) u_z. Yes, that's exactly what I have. Let me check the options again.

Wait, looking back:

Option C says: - (2z / ρ^3) u_ρ + (1/ρ) u_z.

Option G: - (2z / ρ^3) u_ρ + (1 / ρ^2) u_z.

Yes, so my result matches option G. But wait, looking at the options, let me double-check each.

Wait, the question asks for ∇f in cylindrical coordinates. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any partial derivatives.

Let me re-calculate:

f = z/(x² + y²) = z/ρ².

∂f/∂ρ: derivative of z ρ⁻² with respect to ρ is -2 z ρ⁻³ = -2z/ρ^3. Correct.

∂f/∂θ: since f has no θ dependence, zero. Correct.

∂f/∂z: 1/ρ². Correct.

So the gradient is as I derived. So looking again: which option matches (-2z/ρ³) u_ρ + (1/ρ²) u_z.

Looking at the options:

Option G is - (2z / ρ^3) u_ρ + (1 / ρ^2) u_z. Yes, that's exactly what I have. So the correct answer should be option G.

Wait, but let me check the other options to make sure.

Option A: -2z/ρ² u_ρ + 1/ρ^3 u_z. No, because the u_ρ term has ρ squared, but mine has ρ cubed. So no.

Option B: z/ρ³ u_ρ + (1/ρ) u_θ - (1/ρ³) u_z. Doesn't match.

Option C: -2z/ρ³ u_ρ + (1/ρ) u_z. So the u_z term is 1/ρ, but I have 1/ρ². So no.

Option D: -z/ρ² u_ρ + (1/ρ³) u_z. No, the u_ρ term is missing a 2, and the u_z term has 1/ρ^3, but I have 1/ρ^2.

Option E: has u_theta terms, but I have zero there, so no.

Option F: positive terms, but I have a negative u_rho term, so no.

Option H: has 2z/rho^3 u_rho and other terms, but I have -2z/rho^3 u_rho, so no.

Option I: positive 2z/rho^3 u_rho, which doesn't match.

Option J: has u_rho and u_theta terms, which I don't have.

So the correct option is G.

To compute the gradient of the function \( f(x, y, z) = \frac{z}{x^2 + y^2} \) in cylindrical coordinates \((\rho, \theta, z)\), we first express \( f \) in cylindrical coordinates. Since \( x^2 + y^2 = \rho^2 \), the function becomes:

\[
f(\rho, \theta, z) = \frac{z}{\rho^2}.
\]

The gradient in cylindrical coordinates is given by:

\[
\nabla f = \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial \rho} \right) u_\rho + \left( \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta} \right) u_\theta + \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \right) u_z.
\]

We now compute the partial derivatives:

1. **For \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial \rho} \):**
   \[
   \frac{\partial f}{\partial \rho} = \frac{\partial}{\partial \rho} \left( \frac{z}{\rho^2} \right) = z \cdot \frac{\partial}{\partial \rho} \left( \rho^{-2} \right) = z \cdot (-2\rho^{-3}) = -\frac{2z}{\rho^3}.
   \]

2. **For \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta} \):**
   \[
   \frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta} = \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \left( \frac{z}{\rho^2} \right) = 0,
   \]
   since \( f \) does not depend on \( \theta \).

3. **For \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \):**
   \[
   \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} = \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \left( \frac{z}{\rho^2} \right) = \frac{1}{\rho^2}.
   \]

Substituting these results into the gradient formula:

\[
\nabla f = \left( -\frac{2z}{\rho^3} \right) u_\rho + \left( \frac{1}{\rho} \cdot 0 \right) u_\theta + \left( \frac{1}{\rho^2} \right) u_z.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\nabla f = -\frac{2z}{\rho^3} u_\rho + \frac{1}{\rho^2} u_z.
\]

Now, comparing this result with the given options:

- **Option A:** Incorrect, as the \( u_\rho \) term has \( \rho^2 \) in the denominator instead of \( \rho^3 \), and the \( u_z \) term has \( \rho^3 \) instead of \( \rho^2 \).
- **Option B:** Incorrect, as it includes a nonzero \( u_\theta \) term and has incorrect coefficients for \( u_\rho \) and \( u_z \).
- **Option C:** Incorrect, as the \( u_z \) term has \( \rho \) in the denominator instead of \( \rho^2 \).
- **Option D:** Incorrect, as the \( u_\rho \) term is missing the factor of 2, and the \( u_z \) term has \( \rho^3 \) instead of \( \rho^2 \).
- **Option E:** Incorrect, as it includes nonzero \( u_\theta \) and incorrect coefficients.
- **Option F:** Incorrect, as it has positive coefficients for \( u_\rho \) and incorrect terms.
- **Option G:** Correct, as it matches \( -\frac{2z}{\rho^3} u_\rho + \frac{1}{\rho^2} u_z \).
- **Option H:** Incorrect, as it has incorrect coefficients for \( u_\rho \) and \( u_z \), and includes a nonzero \( u_\theta \) term.
- **Option I:** Incorrect, as it has the wrong sign for the \( u_\rho \) term.
- **Option J:** Incorrect, as it includes nonzero \( u_\theta \) and incorrect coefficients.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**G: \( -\frac{2z}{\rho^3} u_\rho + \frac{1}{\rho^2} u_z \).**
