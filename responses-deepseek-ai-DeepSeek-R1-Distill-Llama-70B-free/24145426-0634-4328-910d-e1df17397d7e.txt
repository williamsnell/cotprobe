Question:

The police received an anonymous tip informing them that a pharmacist was engaged in the illegal manufacture of synthetic cocaine. As part of its investigation, the police placed an electronic tracking device on the pharmacist's car. The tracking device was attached to the underbody of the pharmacist's car while it was parked outside his home. The police did not secure a warrant before installing the device. By means of the tracking device, the police were able to trail the pharmacist's movements. The police followed the pharmacist every day for almost a month. Finally, one day the police tracked the pharmacist's car to a vacant warehouse on the outskirts of town. While the pharmacist was inside the building, the police peered in the window and saw drug paraphernalia and equipment used in the manufacture of synthetic cocaine. Based on these observations, the police secured a search warrant and gained entry into the building. Once inside, the police arrested the pharmacist and confiscated a large quantity of synthetic cocaine that had just been produced. At his trial for illegal possession and manufacture of a controlled dangerous substance, the pharmacist moves to suppress the cocaine confiscated by the police. The pharmacist's motion will most likely be

Options:

A: denied, because the police acted in good faith when placing the tracking device.
B: denied, because the police had reasonable suspicion to track the pharmacist's movements.
C: granted, because the pharmacist had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his car.
D: granted, because the police did not have a warrant to place the tracking device on the pharmacist's car.
E: denied, because the police could have discovered the location of the warehouse simply by following the pharmacist's car.
F: denied, because the evidence would have inevitably been discovered.
G: denied, because the electronic surveillance of the pharmacist's car did not exceed 30 days.
H: granted, because the police invaded the pharmacist's privacy by peering into the warehouse window.
I: granted, because the information upon which the search warrant was based was illegally obtained by means of the tracking device.
J: granted, because the seizure must be suppressed as the fruit of an illegal search.

Okay, so I have this question about criminal procedure, specifically dealing with the Fourth Amendment and searches and seizures. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The situation is that the police received an anonymous tip about a pharmacist making synthetic cocaine. They decided to investigate by placing an electronic tracking device on his car without a warrant. The car was parked outside his home when they attached the device. They tracked his movements for almost a month, which led them to a warehouse. There, they saw drug paraphernalia through the window, got a warrant, and found a lot of cocaine. Now, the pharmacist is moving to suppress the evidence, and I need to figure out if his motion will be granted or denied.

First, I remember that the Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. The key issue here is whether placing the tracking device without a warrant constitutes an unreasonable search or seizure.

I think about the case law related to GPS tracking. I recall the Supreme Court case United States v. Jones, which dealt with attaching a GPS device to a car. In that case, the Court held that attaching the device was a physical intrusion, which, under the Fourth Amendment, would require a warrant. So, the government's action in Jones was deemed a search under the Fourth Amendment because they physically placed the GPS on the car.

In this question, the police placed a tracking device on the car without a warrant. So, under Jones, that would be a search requiring a warrant. Since they didn't get one, the placement of the device was unconstitutional. This makes the tracking an illegal search.

Now, the police used the tracking device to find the warehouse. They observed the paraphernalia through the window, which led to getting a search warrant. The issue is whether the evidence obtained from the warehouse should be suppressed because it's the fruit of an illegal search (the tracking device).

The exclusionary rule says that evidence obtained through unconstitutional means (like an illegal search) is inadmissible. So, if the initial tracking was illegal, any evidence derived from it would be tainted and should be suppressed.

Wait, but what about the "inevitable discovery" doctrine? That's when the prosecution shows that they would have found the evidence through lawful means anyway, so it's admissible. The option E says the police could have followed the car without the tracker, but in reality, without the tracker, they might not have found the warehouse. So, I don't think E applies here because the warehouse location was only found due to the illegal tracking.

Looking at the options:

Option I says the warrant was based on illegally obtained info. If the tracking was illegal, then the observations leading to the warrant are tainted. So the warrant might be invalid because it's based on tainted info, making the search warrant invalid. Alternatively, if the warrant affidavit didn't rely on the tracking, maybe it's okay, but it's likely that without the tracker, they wouldn't have found the warehouse.

Option D says the motion is granted because no warrant was obtained for the tracking device. That's correct because the initial placement was a search without a warrant. But the more precise reason is that the evidence is the fruit of an illegal search, which would make option I or J correct.

Wait, option J says the seizure must be suppressed as the fruit of an illegal search. That's a broader statement. If the initial tracking was illegal, then the subsequent search warrant is tainted, making the evidence inadmissible.

Alternatively, option I says the information for the warrant was illegally obtained. So, if the police used the tracking to find the warehouse, then the warrant application includes that info, which is tainted. So the search warrant would be invalid, and the evidence obtained under it would be suppressed.

But wait, in some cases, if the police can show that the evidence would have been discovered anyway, it's admissible. But here, without the tracker, they wouldn't have known to go to the warehouse. So, the evidence is directly tied to the illegal tracking.

Another angle: The car was parked outside his home. The home is a private area, so attaching a device there might have privacy implications. But the main issue is the warrantless tracking.

So, the tracking was unconstitutional, making the evidence (the cocaine) the fruit of that, so it should be suppressed. That points to option I or J.

Option I says the warrant was based on illegal info from the tracking device. So if the warrant affidavit included information from the tracking, then the warrant is invalid. So the evidence would be suppressed because the warrant was invalid. That would make option I correct.

Alternatively, if the police saw the paraphernalia through the window, which is in plain view, maybe that's a different issue. Wait, the plain view doctrine requires that the police are lawfully present when they see the evidence. If they were only at the warehouse because of the illegal tracking, then their presence there was unlawful. So, the plain view wouldn't apply, and the warrant would be invalid.

So, the key is that the initial tracking was illegal, which led them to the warehouse. Therefore, the evidence is tainted.

Looking at the options:

- Option C: Privacy in his car. Well, the tracking device on the car might relate to that, but the main issue is the warrantless placement, not the expectation of privacy in the car itself.

- Option D: No warrant for tracking. Correct in that the tracking was a search without a warrant, so D is a possible answer.

But the suppression is about the evidence, which is the fruit. So the more accurate reason is that the evidence is the fruit of an illegal search, making option J correct. Alternatively, if the warrant was based on tainted info, then option I.

Wait, the question is about the motion to suppress the cocaine. The cocaine was seized under a warrant, but if that warrant was invalid due to being based on illegal info, then the seizure is invalid.

So, the search warrant was obtained based on observations made possible by the illegal tracking. Therefore, the warrant is invalid as "fruit of the poisonous tree," making the evidence inadmissible. So option I says the information was illegally obtained, which led to the warrant, so the motion is granted. Alternatively, option J says it's the fruit, which would also lead to suppression.

But another angle: the Supreme Court in Jones ruled that placing the GPS was a search. So the tracking was illegal without a warrant. Therefore, the evidence obtained from the warehouse is the fruit of that illegal search and should be suppressed. So option J would apply.

Looking at the options:

Option I: ...information upon which the search warrant was based was illegally obtained by means of the tracking device.

Option J: ...seizure must be suppressed as the fruit of an illegal search.

I think both I and J are possible, but which is more accurate? The tracking was illegal, leading to the discovery of the warehouse. They then used that info to get the warrant. So the warrant is based on tainted info, making the warrant invalid. Therefore, the evidence is suppressed because the warrant was invalid. So option I is correct.

Wait, but in the case where the warrant is obtained but based on illegal info, the evidence is still suppressed because the warrant is invalid. So option I would be the reason, but sometimes the fruit of the poisonous tree applies even if a warrant is obtained. For example, if the police get a warrant based on info from an illegal search, the warrant can still be invalid if the affidavit relies on that info.

So in this scenario, the police's knowledge of the warehouse comes from the tracking device. Without that, they wouldn't have known where to look. So when they applied for the search warrant, they likely included that they saw the paraphernalia through the window at the warehouse, which they found because of the tracking. So the warrant is tainted.

Thus, the correct answer would be either I or J. Let me look back at the options.

Option I says the information was illegally obtained. That would make the warrant invalid, so the search was illegal, and the evidence is suppressed.

Option J is more about the seizure being the fruit, meaning even if they had a warrant, the source was tainted, so it's suppressed.

Wait, in the case of the warrant being invalid, it's because the information was tainted, so option I is the reason. But if the warrant was valid for other reasons, maybe it's different. But here, the tracking was the only way they found the warehouse, so without it, they wouldn't have applied for the warrant.

So, the correct answer is either I or J. Let me think about the case law again. In Jones, the court said the GPS was a search, so the tracking was illegal. Any evidence derived from that would be suppressed as fruit.

So the tracking led to the warehouse, which led to the warrant, which led to the seizure. So the seizure is the fruit of the illegal tracking. Therefore, the seizure must be suppressed as the fruit of an illegal search, which is option J.

Wait, but the warrant was obtained based on the observations from the tracking. So the warrant is invalid because it's based on illegal info. So option I would be more about the warrant being invalid, while option J is about the evidence being the fruit.

Hmm. So which is the better answer?

The question is about the suppression of the cocaine. The reason is that the tracking was illegal, making the subsequent evidence inadmissible. So the most direct reason is that the evidence is the fruit of an illegal search (option J).

Alternatively, option I says the warrant was based on illegal info, which makes the warrant invalid. Either way, the evidence is suppressed, but the reasoning is slightly different.

In the Supreme Court case, when a warrant is obtained but based on tainted info, the evidence is still suppressed. So the warrant is invalid because the affidavit was based on illegally obtained info.

Looking at the options, option I is about the information being illegal, making the warrant invalid. So the answer would be I.

Wait, but some might argue that the exclusionary rule applies to the tracking device's info, but the warrant was based on the observations of the paraphernalia. So if the paraphernalia was in plain view, then maybe it's a different issue. But the police were only there because of the illegal tracking, so their presence was unlawful, making the plain view inadmissible.

So, the observation of paraphernalia was part of the same illegal activity, so the warrant is invalid. Therefore, the answer is either I or J.

I think the correct answer here is either I or J. But looking at the options, the most accurate reasoning is that the information in the warrant was illegally obtained, making option I correct. Alternatively, if the warrant was valid, but the evidence is still fruit, then J applies.

Wait, maybe the Supreme Court has held that even if you get a warrant, if the warrant was based on tainted info, the evidence is still suppressed. So option I would be the correct reason.

But I also recall that in some cases, if the police can show that the evidence would have been discovered through a lawful means, it's admissible. But in this case, without the tracking, they wouldn't have found the warehouse.

So, the tracking was illegal, leading to the warehouse, leading to the warrant, leading to the seizure. So the seizure is the fruit of the illegal tracking. Therefore, option J is correct.

Wait, but the warrant was obtained, so it's more about the warrant being invalid, which is option I. Hmm.

I'm a bit confused, but I think the main issue is the warrantless tracking, which was a Fourth Amendment violation, making all subsequent evidence inadmissible as fruit. So the answer is J.

Alternatively, some might argue that the police could have seen where the car was going without the tracking device, but that's speculative. The key is that without the illegal tracking, they wouldn't have known about the warehouse.

So, I think the answer is either I or J. But looking at the options, option J says it's the fruit, which is a more general exclusionary rule application. Option I is more specific about the warrant being based on illegal info.

I think the better answer is J: granted because the seizure is the fruit of an illegal search. So the answer is J.
</think>

The question revolves around whether the evidence obtained from the pharmacist's warehouse should be suppressed due to the police's actions, specifically the warrantless placement of a tracking device on the pharmacist's car. The key issue is whether the tracking constitutes an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment and whether the evidence is tainted as the "fruit of the poisonous tree."

1. **Warrantless Tracking Device**: The Supreme Court's decision in *United States v. Jones* establishes that attaching a GPS tracking device to a vehicle is a search under the Fourth Amendment, requiring a warrant. Since the police placed the tracking device without a warrant, this action was unconstitutional.

2. **Impact on the Search Warrant**: The police used the tracking device to locate the warehouse and observed drug paraphernalia through the window, which led to obtaining a search warrant. However, the warrant was based on information derived from the illegal tracking. Under the exclusionary rule, evidence obtained through unconstitutional means is inadmissible. Thus, the warrant was tainted, and the evidence obtained from the warehouse is inadmissible.

3. **Plain View Doctrine**: The police observed the paraphernalia in plain view, but their presence at the warehouse was only possible due to the illegal tracking. Therefore, the plain view doctrine does not apply, as the police were not lawfully present.

4. **Inevitable Discovery Doctrine**: This doctrine does not apply here because there is no indication that the police would have discovered the warehouse through lawful means independent of the illegal tracking.

5. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option I**: Correct because the search warrant was based on information illegally obtained through the tracking device, making the warrant invalid.
   - **Option J**: Also correct because the seizure of the cocaine is the fruit of the illegal search (the warrantless tracking).

6. **Conclusion**: The most precise reasoning is that the search warrant was invalid because it relied on information obtained through an illegal search. Therefore, the evidence is suppressed because the warrant was based on illegally obtained information.
