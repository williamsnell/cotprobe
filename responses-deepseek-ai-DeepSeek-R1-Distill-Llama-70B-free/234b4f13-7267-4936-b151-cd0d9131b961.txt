Okay, so I have this question about the effects doctrine, and I need to figure out the correct answer. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let me try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that the effects doctrine is related to jurisdiction, specifically criminal jurisdiction. Jurisdiction determines which country has the authority to prosecute someone for a crime. There are several principles that determine jurisdiction, like territoriality, nationality, universality, and maybe others.

The question is asking what the effects doctrine is. The options are A through J, each giving a different definition. Let me think about what I know about the effects doctrine.

I think the effects doctrine is about when a state can claim jurisdiction over a crime based on the effects of the action. So, if someone does something in one country that has effects in another, the second country might have jurisdiction because of those effects.

Wait, I remember the Lotus case from international law. The case involved a collision between a French and a Turkish ship. The French ship was where the collision happened, but the effects (like the loss of life) occurred on the Turkish ship. So Turkey prosecuted the French officer. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) said that Turkey had jurisdiction because the effects of the act were felt there.

So the effects doctrine allows a state to exercise jurisdiction if the harmful effects of an act occur within its territory, even if the act itself happened elsewhere. This is different from the territoriality principle, which focuses on where the act occurred.

Looking at the options now, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: It posits that jurisdiction exists only when it is ineffective. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Jurisdiction isn't about effectiveness in that way. I think this is incorrect.

Option B: The effects doctrine serves to confer jurisdiction on the State sharing the nationality of the victim. Wait, that sounds like the passive nationality principle, where the state can prosecute based on the victim's nationality. But the effects doctrine is about where the effects happen, not necessarily the nationality. So B might not be correct.

Option C: Confer jurisdiction on the State sharing the nationality of the offender. That's the active nationality principle, where the state prosecutes its own nationals. Again, this is different from effects doctrine.

Option D: Jurisdiction is solely determined by the severity of the harmful conduct. No, that's more about the gravity of the offense, not the location of effects. So D is out.

Option E: Confers jurisdiction to the State where the conduct produces effects. Yes, this aligns with what I was thinking. If the effects happen in a state, that state can claim jurisdiction, regardless of where the act occurred.

Option F: Jurisdiction where the conduct originated. That's more like the territorial principle based on where the act started, not the effects. So F is not correct.

Option G: Jurisdiction exists only when ineffective. No, that's confusing. Not right.

Option H: Confers jurisdiction to the state most affected by the conduct. This is a bit tricky. The effects doctrine is about where the effects occur, but H is more about which state is most affected. It could be the same, but I'm not sure if it's the exact definition. The doctrine is more about the presence of effects, not necessarily being the most affected.

Option I: Confers jurisdiction based on an effective link. That sounds like the "genuine link" theory, perhaps from the Nottebohm case, where there's a real connection between the state and the person. But the effects doctrine is more about the location of the effects, not the link.

Option J: Jurisdiction where the offender resides. That's more about the offender's nationality or residence, similar to option C, so J is not right.

So the correct answer should be E. It's about the effects occurring within the state's territory, allowing that state to have jurisdiction.

The effects doctrine is a principle of jurisdiction that allows a state to exercise authority over a matter based on the effects of the conduct occurring within its territory, even if the act itself originated elsewhere. This doctrine was notably applied in the Lotus case, where Turkey prosecuted a French officer for an act that occurred on a French ship but caused effects (loss of life) on a Turkish ship. The key idea is that jurisdiction is established when the harmful consequences of an act are felt within the state's territory.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, G**: Incorrect, as jurisdiction is not determined by effectiveness or ineffectiveness.
- **B, C, J**: These relate to nationality principles (passive, active, or residence), not the effects doctrine.
- **D**: Incorrect, as jurisdiction is not solely based on the severity of conduct.
- **F**: Pertains to where the conduct originated, which is the territoriality principle, not the effects doctrine.
- **H**: While related, it focuses on which state is "most affected," not the specific location of effects.
- **I**: Refers to a "genuine link," which is a different concept.
- **E**: Correct, as it accurately describes the effects doctrine, conferring jurisdiction to the state where the conduct produces effects.

The correct answer is **E**.
