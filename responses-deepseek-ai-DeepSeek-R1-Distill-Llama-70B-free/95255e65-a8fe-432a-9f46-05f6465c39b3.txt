The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A plaintiff sued the insurer of her home after the insurer denied coverage for water damage to the home allegedly caused by a frozen plastic pipe that burst. At trial, the insurer called as an expert witness an engineer, who testified that the pipe had burst because of age rather than freezing. On cross-examination, the engineer admitted that five years earlier, he had been convicted of tax fraud, even though he had asserted that it was his accountant's error. In response, the insurer calls a witness, who is well acquainted with the engineer and his reputation, to testify that (1) in the witness's opinion, the engineer is a truthful person, and (2) the engineer's neighbors all describe him as a truthful person. How much, if any, of the witness's testimony is admissible?

Options:

A: None of the testimony is admissible, because it is collateral, having no bearing on the engineer's qualifications as an expert.
B: Only the portion concerning the engineer's reputation is admissible, because where both opinion and reputation evidence are available, only the latter is admissible under a rule of preference.
C: Both portions of the testimony are admissible, but only as they relate to the engineer's truthfulness, not his expertise.
D: None of the testimony is admissible, because character evidence is not relevant to the engineer's expertise.
E: All of the testimony is admissible to support the engineer's credibility.
F: Only the portion concerning the engineer's reputation is admissible, as it is directly relevant to his character for truthfulness.
G: Only the portion concerning the witness's opinion of the engineer's character is admissible, as it directly relates to his credibility.
H: Only the portion concerning the witness's opinion of the engineer's character, because the witness's reporting of the neighbors' comments is hearsay.
I: None of the testimony is admissible, because the witness is biased due to their acquaintance with the engineer.
J: All of the testimony is admissible, but the judge must instruct the jury to consider the engineer's past conviction.

Okay, so I have this evidence question here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on evidence rules, but I remember some basics. 

The situation is a trial where the plaintiff sued her home insurer. The insurer's expert, an engineer, testified that the pipe burst because of age, not freezing. On cross, the engineer admitted he was convicted of tax fraud five years ago, though he claims it was his accountant's fault. Now, the insurer is calling another witness to testify about the engineer's truthfulness. The witness will say two things: first, their opinion that the engineer is truthful, and second, that the neighbors describe him as truthful.

The question is about the admissibility of this testimony. The options are from A to J.

I think this is about impeaching or rehabilitating a witness's credibility. The engineer's credibility was attacked because of the prior conviction. So the insurer wants to counter that by showing he's truthful.

I remember that when a witness's character for truthfulness is attacked, the opposing party can offer evidence to rehabilitate that witness. The methods allowed are opinion testimony and reputation evidence.

So the two parts of the witness's testimony are: (1) the witness's opinion that the engineer is truthful, and (2) the reputation in the community (neighbors say he's truthful).

I think both are admissible. But wait, there's a rule about the order and what's allowed. Oh, right, under the Federal Rules, when a witness's character has been attacked, you can offer either opinion or reputation evidence, but I think you can't do both. Wait, no, I think you can use both, but maybe the preference is given to reputation over opinion.

Wait, no, I think that's for when the witness's character evidence is being presented as substantive evidence. No, wait, maybe it's about prior convictions. Alternatively, when attacking a witness's credibility, you can bring extrinsic evidence only for a felony conviction, but for other things, like specific instances of conduct, you can't. But here, the engineer was impeached with a prior conviction, which is allowed.

Now, the insurer is trying to rehabilitate. So the methods allowed for rehabilitation are opinion and reputation. So the witness can testify about their opinion of the engineer's truthfulness, and also about his reputation in the community.

But wait, is there a rule that prohibits both? I think you can use either or both. Let me check my memory: FRE 405(a) says that in cases where character evidence is admissible, it may be proved by testimony about the person's reputation or by testimony in the form of an opinion. But when character is a central issue, like in a criminal case where the defendant's character is in issue, then you can use both opinion and reputation. But when it's about a witness's credibility, which is a secondary issue, I think the rule is that you can offer opinion or reputation, but not both. Or maybe you can offer both, but I'm not sure.

Wait, in the context of a witness's credibility, once the witness's character for truthfulness has been attacked, the opposing party can offer evidence to rebut that. The rules allow for opinion and reputation, but I think you can use both. So the witness can testify to their opinion, and also to the reputation.

Alternatively, maybe the opinion is inadmissible because it's collateral? No, because we're directly addressing the witness's credibility, so it's not collateral.

Wait, but the options say that the testimony is about (1) opinion and (2) reputation. So both would be admissible for rehabilitation.

Looking at the options:

Option E says all of the testimony is admissible to support credibility.

Option F says only the reputation part is admissible.

Option H says only the opinion is admissible because the reputation part is hearsay.

Wait, the reputation testimony is the witness testifying about what the neighbors say. So that would be hearsay because it's an out-of-court statement offered for the truth. But reputation evidence is an exception to hearsay under FRE 803(21). So the witness's testimony about the engineer's reputation is admissible as a hearsay exception.

So both parts are admissible. So the answer would be E.

But wait, let me think again. The question is about the admissibility. The engineer's credibility was attacked, so the insurer can offer opinion and reputation evidence to rebut that. So both (1) and (2) are admissible.

Is there any reason why the opinion would be inadmissible? I don't think so. FRE 405 allows both. So both can come in.

So the correct answer would be E: All of the testimony is admissible to support the engineer's credibility.

Wait, but looking back, option C says both are admissible but only as to truthfulness, not expertise. But the question is about credibility, so it's about truthfulness. So C is also a possibility, but I think the question is just about admissibility, not the purpose.

Wait, but in the question, the expert's opinion was about the pipe's cause, so his expertise is a factor. But the impeachment was about his truthfulness, so the rehabilitation is about his credibility as a witness, not his expertise.

So the testimony is about his truthfulness, so it's relevant to his credibility as a witness, not his expertise. So the admissibility is about credibility, not expertise.

So looking at the options:

Option C: Both admissible as to truthfulness, not expertise. That makes sense.

Option E: All admissible to support credibility. So both are about credibility, so E and C both seem possible.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option C: Both portions are admissible, but only as they relate to the engineer's truthfulness, not his expertise.

Option E: All of the testimony is admissible to support the engineer's credibility.

Wait, the question is about how much of the testimony is admissible, regardless of the purpose. So the testimony is about credibility, so it's admissible for that purpose, but not for expertise.

So the answer would be C or E. But I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no, the question is about admissibility, not the purpose. So both parts are admissible as evidence concerning the engineer's credibility, so both are admissible.

So the correct answer is E.

Wait, but some sources say that when a witness's character is attacked, you can offer either opinion or reputation, but not both. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the opinion is allowed because it's not subject to the same restrictions as reputation.

Wait, another thought: The opinion testimony is about the engineer's character for truthfulness, which is allowed under FRE 701 (lay opinion) or 702 (expert opinion if the witness is an expert, but here the witness is just someone acquainted with the engineer).

Wait, the witness is testifying about their opinion of the engineer's truthfulness. That's a lay opinion under FRE 701, as it's based on their perception and would be helpful to the jury.

So both the opinion and the reputation are admissible.

Thus, the answer should be E: All of the testimony is admissible to support the engineer's credibility.

Wait, but option F says only the reputation is admissible. Hmm. Let me think again.

FRE 405(a) states: "a person's character or character trait is admissible, it may be proved by testimony about the personâ€™s reputation or by testimony in the form of an opinion."

So when character evidence is admissible, both reputation and opinion are allowed. Here, the engineer's character for truthfulness is at issue because he was impeached with a prior conviction. So the insurer can offer both reputation and opinion evidence to rebut that.

Thus, both parts are admissible, making E correct.

But wait, looking at the options, E is: "All of the testimony is admissible to support the engineer's credibility."

So E would be correct.

But another option is C: Both portions are admissible, but only as they relate to the engineer's truthfulness, not his expertise.

But the question is about admissibility, not the purpose for which it's used. So the evidence is admissible for credibility, which is a proper purpose.

So the answer is E.

The question revolves around the admissibility of testimony aimed at rehabilitating the credibility of an expert witness whose character for truthfulness was attacked due to a prior conviction. The insurer seeks to introduce two types of evidence: (1) the witness's opinion that the engineer is truthful and (2) the engineer's reputation for truthfulness in the community, as described by his neighbors.

Under the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE), when a witness's character for truthfulness has been attacked, the opposing party may offer evidence to rebut the attack. Specifically, FRE 405(a) allows for the introduction of both opinion testimony and reputation evidence to prove a person's character or character trait. Here, the engineer's credibility was impeached, and the insurer is entitled to present evidence to rehabilitate it.

1. **Opinion Testimony**: The witness's opinion that the engineer is truthful is admissible under FRE 701 (lay opinion testimony) or FRE 702 (expert opinion testimony, if applicable). This testimony is relevant to the engineer's credibility and is not considered collateral.

2. **Reputation Evidence**: The testimony about the engineer's reputation for truthfulness in the community is admissible under FRE 803(21), which provides a hearsay exception for reputation evidence. This testimony is also relevant to the engineer's credibility.

Both forms of testimony are admissible because they directly address the engineer's truthfulness, which was the focus of the impeachment. There is no rule prohibiting the use of both opinion and reputation evidence in this context. The testimony is not being offered to establish the engineer's expertise but rather to support his credibility as a witness.

Given the above analysis, the correct answer is:

**E: All of the testimony is admissible to support the engineer's credibility.**

Answer: E
