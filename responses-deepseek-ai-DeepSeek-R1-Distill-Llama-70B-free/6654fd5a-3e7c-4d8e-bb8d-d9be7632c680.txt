Okay, I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Tiwanaku. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is: Tiwanaku, with its capital at Titicaca, was one of the ___________ kingdoms of the ancient world. The options are A through J, each with different adjectives.

First, I remember that Tiwanaku was an ancient civilization. I think it was located in South America, maybe near Lake Titicaca. I've heard it's one of the older civilizations in the Americas.

I'm trying to recall what made Tiwanaku notable. I think they were known for their advanced stone structures and architecture. Their capital, Titicaca, was probably a major center. Wait, wasn't Tiwanaku one of the more complex societies for its time?

So looking at the options, the question is asking which adjective fits best. The options are about size, population, influence, etc.

Option A: largest. I'm not sure if Tiwanaku was the largest. I know the Inca Empire was large, but Tiwanaku was before that. Maybe it's not the largest.

Option B: most populated. Again, I don't recall it being the most populous. Maybe other ancient cities like Rome or China were more populated.

Option C: earliest. It's an early civilization, but was it the earliest? I think there were others, like Mesopotamia or Egypt, that were earlier. So maybe not the earliest.

Option D: least known. I don't think so. It's studied in archaeology, so it's known, though perhaps not as famous as others.

Option E: richest. Maybe in terms of culture or resources, but I'm not certain if it was the richest.

Option F: most influential. It influenced later cultures, like the Inca, but was it the most influential overall? Maybe not compared to something like Rome or China.

Option G: most peaceful. I don't have any info on that. It might have had conflicts, but I'm not sure.

Option H: strongest. Again, not sure. Strength could refer to military, economy, etc.

Option I: highest. Hmm, highest in what sense? Maybe in terms of elevation. Lake Titicaca is at a high altitude. So maybe the highest in location.

Option J: most advanced. This rings a bell. Tiwanaku is known for advanced engineering and architecture. They had sophisticated stonework without wheels or iron tools.

So considering all options, I think the best fit is J: most advanced. They were known for their advanced techniques and civilization for their time.

Tiwanaku was known for its advanced engineering and architecture, making it one of the most advanced civilizations of its time.

Answer: J
