Okay, so I've got this question about brain development. The question is asking which part of the brain is the least developed at birth. The options are from A to I, each corresponding to a different brain structure. Hmm, I need to think about what I remember about brain development in infants.

I remember that when a baby is born, their brain isn't fully developed. Some parts are more mature than others. For example, the brain stem is pretty developed because it controls vital functions like breathing and heart rate, which are essential from the moment of birth. So I can probably rule that out since it's one of the options (Option I).

The cerebellum is involved in coordinating movements. I think it's also not fully developed at birth, which is why newborns have limited motor skills and their movements are pretty uncoordinated. But is it the least developed, or is there another part that's even less developed?

Wait, I think the cerebral cortex is the part that's responsible for higher-order thinking, like reasoning and decision-making. I remember learning that the cerebral cortex develops a lot after birth. Infants can't do complex thinking, so maybe the cerebral cortex is the least developed at birth. That would correspond to option D.

But then there are other options like the occipital lobe (A), which handles vision. I think babies have some visual abilities, though not as sharp as adults, so maybe the occipital lobe is somewhat developed. The temporal lobe (B) is involved in speech and memory, and the parietal lobe (C) in sensory input. I'm not sure about their development stages.

The limbic system (E) includes structures like the hippocampus, which is important for memory. I don't think that's the least developed. The hypothalamus (F) regulates body temperature and hormones, which are crucial from birth, so it's probably developed enough. The thalamus (G) relays sensory information, and while it's important, I'm not certain about its developmental state at birth.

So putting it all together, the cerebral cortex (D) is the area responsible for complex functions that develop after birth. Since it's the least developed, that must be the correct answer.

The cerebral cortex is the least developed area of the brain at birth. It is responsible for higher-order functions such as reasoning and decision-making, which develop significantly after birth. Other brain regions like the brain stem (I) and cerebellum (H) are more developed at birth to manage essential functions and basic coordination. Therefore, the correct answer is:

D
