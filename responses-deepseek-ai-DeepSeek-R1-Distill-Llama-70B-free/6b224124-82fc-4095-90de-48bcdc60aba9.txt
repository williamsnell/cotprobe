Okay, so I have this economics question in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says the price of beef rises by 10 percent, and as a result, the quantity of beef demanded falls by 20 percent. Then it asks what we can conclude from this. The options are A through J, each combining elasticity of demand with whether consumer spending is rising or falling.

Hmm, right. I remember that price elasticity of demand measures how responsive the quantity demanded is to a change in price. The formula I think is something like the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price. Oh wait, but actually, it's the percentage change in quantity demanded relative to the percentage change in price. So if the price goes up by 10% and quantity demanded goes down by 20%, the elasticity is 20%/10% = 2. Oh wait, but wait, since the quantity demanded falls when price rises, the elasticity should be negative, but when calculating the absolute value, we just look at the magnitude. So the elasticity here is 2, which is greater than 1.

Wait, elasticity can be categorized as elastic, inelastic, or unit elastic. Elastic is when the elasticity is greater than 1, meaning a percentage change in price leads to a larger percentage change in quantity. Inelastic is less than 1. So in this case, since 2 > 1, demand is price elastic.

Now, what about consumer spending? Consumer spending would be price multiplied by quantity. So if price goes up by 10% and quantity demanded goes down by 20%, what happens to total spending?

Let me think in terms of numbers. Let's say the original price is $10 and the quantity is 100 units. So original spending is 10 * 100 = $1000.

After the price increase, the new price is $11 (10% increase). The quantity demanded falls by 20%, so new quantity is 80 units. So new spending is 11 * 80 = $880. So spending decreased from $1000 to $880. So spending is falling.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. Because the percentage changes: a 10% increase in price would take the new price to 1.1 times original. A 20% decrease in quantity makes it 0.8 times original. So the new spending is 1.1 * 0.8 = 0.88 times original, which is an 12% decrease. So yes, spending is falling.

So putting it together: demand is price elastic (since elasticity is 2 >1), and consumer spending is falling because total revenue (price times quantity) went down.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Elastic, spending rising. No, because spending fell.

Option B: Inelastic, spending falling. But elasticity was 2, so not inelastic.

Option C: Unit elastic, spending rising. Doesn't fit.

Option D: Elastic, spending falling. This fits our analysis.

Option E: Perfectly inelastic, spending rising. No, because perfectly inelastic means any price change leads to no change in quantity, which isn't the case here.

Option F: Perfectly elastic. That's when a small price change leads to infinite change in quantity, which isn't this case.

So the correct answer should be D.

The question examines the relationship between price elasticity of demand and changes in consumer spending. When the price of beef increases by 10% and the quantity demanded falls by 20%, we calculate the price elasticity of demand as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price. Here, the elasticity is 20%/10% = 2, which is greater than 1, indicating that demand is price elastic.

Next, we analyze the impact on consumer spending, which is the product of price and quantity. If the price rises by 10% and quantity falls by 20%, the new spending is 1.1 (price factor) * 0.8 (quantity factor) = 0.88 of the original spending, representing a 12% decrease. Thus, consumer spending is falling.

Among the options, the correct choice is the one that states demand is price elastic and consumer spending is falling.

Answer: D
