Okay, so I need to figure out what Clarence Darrow's belief about the meaning of life was. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with him, but I remember he was a lawyer, right? Like a famous defense attorney, maybe from the early 20th century or something. Oh wait, wasn't he involved in the Scopes Monkey Trial? Yeah, that sounds right.

Now, the question is about his beliefs on life's meaning. The options are from A to J. Let me think about what I know about Darrow. He was known for being a bit of a skeptic, I think. He might have had some nihilistic views or maybe he didn't believe in an inherent meaning to life. I remember something about him being an agnostic or atheist, which could influence his views on life's purpose.

Looking at the options:

A: Life was meaningful for most people. I don't think so, because if he was a skeptic, he might not see it that way.

B: Life as a gift to cherish. That sounds more positive, maybe religious, which doesn't fit with an agnostic view.

C: Life is hard but worthwhile. Maybe, but I'm not sure.

D: Unpredictable journey with moments of meaning. That sounds possible, but I'm not certain.

E: Series of random events with no ultimate purpose. Oh, that seems more in line with a skeptical viewpoint, someone who doesn't believe in a higher purpose.

F: Constant struggle with no reward. That's pretty bleak. I think Darrow was more about the lack of inherent meaning rather than life being a struggle.

G: Uncertain but ultimately rewarding. That seems contradictory if he didn't believe in a higher purpose.

H: Inherently joyful and full of meaning. No, that doesn't fit his skeptical side.

I: Not worthwhile. That's similar to E, but maybe more negative.

J: Cosmic joke without real meaning. That's a strong statement, implying life is meaningless, like a joke. Maybe that's too harsh.

So, between E and J. I think E says there's no ultimate purpose, which aligns with an agnostic or atheistic belief. He might have thought life's events are random without a grand purpose. J is more about it being a joke, which I'm not sure he exactly said, but the idea of no real meaning is similar.

Wait, I think Darrow was quoted as saying something like life having no inherent meaning. So the correct option would be E: Life was a series of random events with no ultimate purpose.

I'm leaning towards E because that directly states no ultimate purpose, which fits his skeptical views.

Clarence Darrow, known for his skeptical and agnostic views, likely believed that life lacked an inherent or ultimate purpose. Among the options provided, the one that aligns most closely with his perspective is that life is a series of random events without a higher purpose.
