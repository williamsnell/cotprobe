Okay, so I've got this question about the Iran-Contra affair and public opinion on Reagan's handling of information. Hmm, I remember that the Iran-Contra affair was a big scandal during Reagan's presidency. It had something to do with selling arms to Iran and diverting funds to the Contras in Nicaragua, right?

The question is asking what percentage of Americans believed Reagan was withholding information in 1987. The options are from A to J, with various percentages. I'm not exactly sure of the exact figure, but I think it was a significant majority. 

Wait, I recall that during the hearings and the scandal, Reagan's approval ratings took a hit. People started doubting his honesty. I think a lot of Americans felt he wasn't telling the whole truth. Maybe around 60% or higher? 

I'm trying to remember if it was more than half. I think it was over 50%, so options like 60%, 75%, 80%, or 90% are possible. I don't think it was as low as 45% or 35%. Also, 2% or 10% seem too low given the media coverage at the time.

So narrowing it down, I'm considering options A (60%), B (75%), C (80%), E (90%). I think the figure was quite high because the scandal was pretty major. I remember reading that a significant portion of the public lost trust in Reagan. 

Wait, maybe it was around 75%? Or was it higher? I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact number. Let me think. The Iran-Contra affair happened in the late '80s, and it's one of the bigger scandals of his presidency. The public reaction was strong, so perhaps a higher percentage like 75% or 80% believed he was withholding info.

Alternatively, I think the number might have been around 60% to 70%. I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to recall any specific polls from that time. I think a Gallup poll around then showed that a majority, like 60-something percent, thought Reagan was not telling all he knew.

Wait, another angle: The Tower Commission report came out in 1987, which criticized Reagan's handling but didn't find direct evidence he knew about the diversion. Still, public opinion might have been skeptical. So perhaps a little over 60% thought he was holding back info.

Looking back at the options, 60% is option A, 75% is B, 80% is C. I'm leaning towards 60% being the correct answer, but I'm not 100% sure. Maybe I should go with the middle option, like 60% or 75%.

Alternatively, I think the percentage might have been higher, like 75%, because the scandal was so significant and there was a lot of media coverage suggesting a cover-up. So maybe option B is correct.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think of other historical context. The Watergate scandal had higher percentages of distrust, but Iran-Contra was significant too. I think during the hearings, public opinion shifted, and a majority believed Reagan was involved or at least not forthcoming.

I think the correct answer is 60%. So option A. But wait, another thought: I remember a figure of around 70%, but that's not one of the options. So maybe the closest higher option is 75%, which is B.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 80%. I'm not entirely sure. I think I'll go with 75% as the answer, option B.

The Iran-Contra affair was a significant scandal during Reagan's presidency, involving the sale of arms to Iran and the diversion of funds to the Contras in Nicaragua. Public opinion at the time reflected a growing distrust in Reagan's handling of the situation. Considering the options provided and the historical context, the percentage of Americans who believed Reagan was withholding information was likely around 75%, making option B the most plausible answer.
