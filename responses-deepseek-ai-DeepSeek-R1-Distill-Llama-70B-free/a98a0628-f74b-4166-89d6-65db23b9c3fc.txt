Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because optics can be tricky for me. But let's take it step by step. The question is about a plane mirror showing the image of a tree, and I need to find the height of the tree.

Alright, let me read the problem again to make sure I get all the details. The mirror is 5 cm long. It's just large enough to show the whole image of the tree when held 30 cm from the observer's eye. The observer is 100 meters away from the tree. Hmm. So I think this has to do with how much of the tree can be seen in the mirror, which probably relates to the size of the mirror and the angles involved.

Wait, I remember something about mirrors and angular size. When using a mirror, the size of the mirror required to see an image depends on the angle subtended by the object. If the mirror is just big enough, the angle from the top of the tree to the mirror and then to the observer's eye must match the mirror's height.

So, I think the key here is to calculate the angular size of the tree and then see how that relates to the mirror's size. Let me think about the setup. The observer is 100 m from the tree, and the mirror is 30 cm from their eye. So the mirror is acting like a smaller version, right? Like, the mirror's size determines how much of the tree can be viewed.

I remember the concept of the angular height. The angular height θ can be calculated using the tangent function. For small angles, tanθ ≈ θ in radians. So, the angular height of the tree would be θ = arctan(height of tree / distance to tree). But wait, how does the mirror come into play here?

Ah, right! The mirror's height needed to capture the entire image would be based on the same angular size from the observer's eye. So the mirror's height (h_mirror) relates to its distance from the eye (d_mirror) and the same angle θ. So, h_mirror = d_mirror * tanθ.

Since the mirror is 5 cm in height, I can set up the equation: 5 cm = 30 cm * tanθ. Wait, but I think I might have that backwards. Let me think again. If the mirror is at 30 cm, then the height it can display is related to the angle. So the angle θ for the mirror would be (h_mirror / distance_to_mirror), which is 5cm/30cm. But wait, that's the angle subtended at the eye by the mirror. Hmm, maybe that's not directly the same as the tree's angle.

Wait, maybe I should think of it this way: The mirror's size limits the angular size of the image. So the tree's image is formed by the mirror, and the mirror's height determines the maximum angle that can be captured. So the tree's angular height should be equal to the mirror's angular height as seen by the observer.

So the tree's angular height θ_tree is equal to the mirror's angular height θ_mirror. So θ_tree = θ_mirror.

θ_tree is the angle subtended by the tree at the observer's eye. So, θ_tree = arctan(H_tree / D), where H_tree is the height of the tree and D is the distance from the observer to the tree (100 m).

θ_mirror is the angle subtended by the mirror at the observer's eye. So, θ_mirror = arctan(h_mirror / d_mirror), where h_mirror is 5 cm and d_mirror is 0.3 m (30 cm). Wait, wait, wait! No, because the mirror is a plane mirror, the image is virtual and located behind the mirror. Oh wait, but for the purpose of angular size, I think the distance used is the distance from the eye to the mirror. Because the image is formed as if it's behind the mirror, but the apparent size depends on the mirror's size and its distance from the eye.

So, the angular size of the mirror is θ_mirror = arctan( (h_mirror/2) / d_mirror ), wait no, that's for the radius in a spherical mirror. No, in a plane mirror, the image height is the same as the object's height, but the position is virtual. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating this. Since the mirror is 5 cm tall, the maximum height of the image it can display is 5 cm, but the image's angular size depends on how far the mirror is from the eye.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the angle subtended by the top of the tree and the bottom, and ensure that the mirror can capture that angle.

So, let me structure this:

The tree is at 100 m away. Its height is H. The angle θ it subtends at the observer's eye is θ = arctan(H / 100).

The mirror is 30 cm from the eye and is 5 cm tall. The mirror's height is such that it can just show the entire image of the tree. So the angle subtended by the mirror's height should be equal to the angle subtended by the tree.

Wait, but the mirror's image would form a virtual image behind the mirror. The size of the image in the mirror would depend on the magnification, but for a plane mirror, the magnification is 1, so the image's size is the same as the object's. But wait, the object here is the tree, so the image of the tree would be as tall as the tree, but located behind the mirror.

Wait, but the mirror's size is what limits how much of the image you can see. So the mirror can only display a part of the image. So the height of the mirror determines the maximum angular size that can be seen.

So, the mirror's height (5 cm) at a distance of 30 cm from the eye subtends an angle of theta_mirror = 5cm / 30cm = 1/6 radians. Wait, that's in terms of tan(theta_mirror) = opposite/adjacent = 5cm / 30 cm = 1/6.

So tan(theta) = 1/6. So theta is arctan(1/6). But this theta would be the same as the angle subtended by the tree at the observer's eye.

Wait, no. Because the tree's height is H, and it's 100 meters away. So the angle theta_tree is given by tan(theta_tree) = H / 100 m.

But since the mirror can only display up to theta_mirror, which is the same as theta_tree, then theta_tree = arctan(1/6). Therefore, H = 100 m * tan(theta_mirror).

Wait, but in that case, H = 100 * (1/6) meters. Because tan(theta) = 1/6, so H = 100 * (1/6) = 16.666... meters. Which is approximately 16.67 meters.

Looking at the options, option A is 16.67m. So that's probably the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. So the mirror's height is 5 cm, distance 30 cm. So the angle it subtends is 5/30 = 1/6. So theta is arctan(1/6). Then, for the tree, the angle is the same, so H = 100 * (1/6) = 16.6667 m. Yes, that makes sense.

So the answer should be A: 16.67m.

To determine the height of the tree, we analyze the situation using the concept of angular size. The tree is 100 m away from the observer, and the mirror, which is 5 cm tall, is held 30 cm from the observer's eye. The mirror is just large enough to show the entire image of the tree, meaning the angular size of the tree as seen by the observer is equal to the angular size of the mirror.

The angular size of the mirror is calculated using the formula:

\[
\tan(\theta_{\text{mirror}}) = \frac{\text{height of mirror}}{\text{distance of mirror from eye}} = \frac{5 \, \text{cm}}{30 \, \text{cm}} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

Thus, the angular size of the mirror is:

\[
\theta_{\text{mirror}} = \arctan\left(\frac{1}{6}\right).
\]

Since the angular size of the tree is the same as that of the mirror, we can write:

\[
\theta_{\text{tree}} = \arctan\left(\frac{\text{height of tree}}{\text{distance to tree}}\right) = \arctan\left(\frac{H}{100}\right),
\]

where \( H \) is the height of the tree. Equating the two angular sizes:

\[
\arctan\left(\frac{H}{100}\right) = \arctan\left(\frac{1}{6}\right).
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{H}{100} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

Solving for \( H \):

\[
H = 100 \times \frac{1}{6} = 16.67 \, \text{m}.
\]

Thus, the height of the tree is approximately **16.67 meters**.

The correct answer is:

**A: 16.67m**
