Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about corporate law, specifically regarding the removal of directors. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says that in the absence of a provision to the contrary in the articles of incorporation, what happens with directors elected for a specified term. The options are A through J.

I remember that corporate governance rules vary, but generally, directors serve a term. Now, the key point here is whether they can be removed before their term ends if the articles don't say anything about it.

Wait, under common law, I think directors can be removed by shareholders with or without cause, but that might depend on the jurisdiction and the specific laws. But wait, in some places, like under the Model Business Corporation Act (MBCA), which many states follow, there's a default rule unless the articles state otherwise.

So the default is that directors can be removed with or without cause. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact conditions. Let me think again. If the articles don't have a provision, then the default is that shareholders can remove directors. But how? Do they need cause, or can they do it without cause?

I recall that in the absence of any specific provisions, the general rule is that directors can be removed by a vote of the shareholders, even without cause. But wait, sometimes it's only for cause unless the articles say otherwise. That's conflicting.

Wait, maybe I should think about this more carefully. Under the MBCA, which is a standard model, unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise, directors can be removed with or without cause. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, some sources say that without a specific provision, directors can be removed only for cause.

Wait, no, another thought: if a director is elected for a term, the idea is that they serve that term unless removed. But the mechanism for removal depends on state law and the articles.

In many states, the default is that directors can be removed by the shareholders at any time, with or without cause, unless the articles specify otherwise. So if the articles don't say anything, then the shareholders can remove them. But does this require a cause or not?

Alternatively, I think that under the MBCA, the default is that directors can be removed with or without cause. So the answer would be that the shareholders can remove them, with or without cause.

Looking at the options:

Option E says they can be removed at a meeting with or without cause. That sounds right.

Option H says only for cause and after opportunity to be heard. But if the default is without cause, then H would be incorrect.

Option I says only for cause. So that would be if the default requires cause, but I think default allows removal without cause.

So if the articles don't have a provision, the default allows removal with or without cause. So the answer should be E.
</think>

In the absence of a provision to the contrary in the articles of incorporation, the default rule under corporate law, as reflected in the Model Business Corporation Act (MBCA) and many jurisdictions, allows shareholders to remove directors with or without cause. This means that directors elected for a specified term can be removed by a vote of the shareholders at a meeting, even if no cause is provided, unless the articles explicitly state otherwise. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option E** correctly states that directors can be removed at a meeting of the shareholders, with or without cause, aligning with the default rule.
- **Option H** incorrectly restricts removal to cases where cause is shown and an opportunity to be heard is provided, which is not the default.
- **Option I** also incorrectly limits removal to cases of cause, which does not reflect the default rule.

Thus, the correct answer is **E**, as it accurately represents the default rule allowing removal with or without cause.

Answer: E
