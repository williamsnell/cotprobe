Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a water pump motor. I'm a bit rusty on my physics, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The motor has a horsepower rating of 11.3 hp. It's supposed to pump water from a well at a rate of 1 cubic foot per second. The weight density of water is given as 62.4 pounds per cubic foot. The question is asking for the maximum depth the well can have, neglecting friction. The options are from A to J, with various depths.

Hmm, right. I remember that horsepower relates to power, which is energy per unit time. So the idea here is probably to equate the power provided by the motor to the rate of doing work in lifting the water.

Let me jot down the given values:

- Power (P) = 11.3 horsepower (hp)
- Flow rate (Q) = 1 ft³/s
- Weight density of water (ρ) = 62.4 lb/ft³

I know that 1 horsepower is equal to 550 foot-pounds per second. So first, I should convert the motor's power into foot-pounds per second to have consistent units.

Calculating that: 11.3 hp * 550 ft·lb/s per hp = ?

Let me compute 11 * 550 first. 11*500 is 5500, 11*50 is 550, so total 6050. Then 0.3*550 is 165. So 6050 + 165 = 6215. So P = 6215 ft·lb/s.

Next, the pump is doing work by lifting the water. The work done per second (power) is equal to the weight being lifted multiplied by the height it's lifted, right? So Power = Weight * Depth * flow rate, I think.

Wait, more accurately, the power is the rate at which work is done. Work done in lifting is force times distance. The force here is the weight of the water being lifted per second.

So the mass flow rate (dm/dt) would be the volume per second times the density, but since we're dealing with weight (which is mass times g), maybe it's easier to think in terms of weight per time.

The weight per second is density (weight per volume) times flow rate (volume per second). So weight per second (dF/dt) = ρ * Q.

Wait, that makes sense. So dF/dt = 62.4 lb/ft³ * 1 ft³/s = 62.4 lb/s.

Wait no, that can't be right. Wait, 62.4 lb per cubic foot times 1 cubic foot per second gives 62.4 lb/s. Oh wait, no, wait. That would be lb per second, but power is in foot-pounds per second. So the power needed is the weight lifted (lb) times the height (ft) per second.

So power P = (weight per second) * height.

So P = (62.4 lb/s) * h (ft), but wait, no. Wait, the power is the rate of doing work. Work is force times distance. So P = force * velocity. But here, the force is the weight being lifted, which is ρ * Q * g? Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's think about the energy. The pump is doing work against gravity to lift the water. The work done per unit time (power) is equal to the weight of the water lifted per unit time multiplied by the height.

So, the weight lifted per second is the volume per second times the weight density. So that's Q * ρ. So 1 ft³/s * 62.4 lb/ft³ = 62.4 lb/s.

Wait, but weight is a force. So the force here is 62.4 lb per second? No, wait, no, that's not quite right. The weight is 62.4 lb per cubic foot, so each cubic foot weighs 62.4 lb. So each second, we're lifting 62.4 lb of water, because 1 ft³/s * 62.4 lb/ft³ = 62.4 lb/s. So the force is 62.4 lb/s? No, wait. Maybe I should consider it differently.

Wait, no. The flow rate is 1 ft³/s. Each ft³ weighs 62.4 lb, so each second, we're lifting 62.4 lb. So the weight per second is 62.4 lb/s. But wait, power is (force * distance) / time. So in this case, the force is 62.4 lb, and the distance is h (the depth) per second? Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, the power P is equal to the weight lifted per second times the height per second. Wait, no. Let me think about units.

Power is in foot-pounds per second. So P = (force in lb) * (distance in ft) / (time in s). So P = (F * d) / t.

But here, the force F is the weight of the water being lifted, which is (density) * volume. Since density is given as weight density, so F = ρ * V, where V is the volume. But V is being pumped per second, so dV/dt = Q.

So the force per unit time (dF/dt) is ρ * Q. So that's 62.4 lb/ft³ * 1 ft³/s = 62.4 lb/s.

Wait, no, dF/dt would be the rate of change of force, which isn't quite right. Maybe I should think in terms of power as force times velocity. But the velocity here is the rate at which the water is being lifted, which is h per second? No, wait, because the depth h is how far it's lifted, not the speed.

Wait, maybe I should think of it as the pump lifting a certain mass per second to a height h. So the work done per second (power) is (mass per second) * g * h. But wait, in the English system, weight is mass times g, so maybe it's better to work with weight.

So, let's think in terms of weight instead of mass. The weight of the water pumped per second is ρ * Q, which is 62.4 lb/s.

So the power required would be that weight rate multiplied by the height h (because work is force times distance). So P = (62.4 lb/s) * h (ft) * (1 second). Wait, no, because power is in ft-lb/s, so the units would be (lb * ft)/s.

So P = (62.4 lb/s) * h ft. So the units would be (lb*ft)/s, which matches the power's unit.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because 62.4 lb/s times h ft would give lb*ft/s, which is correct for power.

So P = 62.4 * h.

But wait, the power available is 6215 ft-lb/s. So:

6215 ft-lb/s = 62.4 lb/s * h ft.

So solving for h: h = 6215 / 62.4.

Let me compute that. 6215 / 62.4.

Hmm, let's see. 62.4 * 100 is 6240, which is a bit more than 6215. So 100 would give 6240, which is 25 more than 6215. So 6215 is 6240 -25. So 6240 is 62.4 * 100, so 6215 is 62.4 * (100 - (25/62.4)).

Wait, 25/62.4 is approximately 0.401. So 100 - 0.401 is about 99.599. So approximately 99.6 ft.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest option is H: 120 ft, or E: 100 ft. Hmm, but my calculation gives about 99.6, which is around 100 ft.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 6215 divided by 62.4 more accurately.

6215 ÷ 62.4 

Let me compute this step by step.

First, 62.4 * 100 = 6240, which is 25 more than 6215. So 6215 = 62.4 * 99.6, approximately.

Wait, 62.4 * 99 = 62.4*(100-1) = 6240 -62.4 = 6177.6.

Then, 6215 - 6177.6 = 37.4.

So 37.4 /62.4 = approximately 0.6.

So 99 + 0.6 = 99.6. So h ≈99.6 ft.

Looking at the options, E is 100 ft, which is very close. So the answer should be E: 100 ft.

But wait, let me double-check the initial setup because sometimes I mix up units.

Wait, the power from the motor is 11.3 hp, which I converted to 6215 ft-lb/s. That's correct because 1 hp is 550 ft-lb/s.

Then, the power used is the weight lifted per second times the height. The weight per second is 62.4 lb/s, as 1 ft³/s * 62.4 lb/ft³ = 62.4 lb/s.

So P = (62.4 lb/s) * h ft = 62.4 h lb-ft/s.

Setting that equal to 6215 lb-ft/s:

62.4 h = 6215 → h = 6215 / 62.4 ≈ 99.6 ft.

So the closest option is E: 100 ft. So I think the answer is E.

To determine the maximum depth the well may have, we start by analyzing the power provided by the motor and the work required to pump water. The motor has a power rating of 11.3 horsepower (hp), which is converted to foot-pounds per second (ft·lb/s) using the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{hp} = 550 \, \text{ft·lb/s} \). Thus:

\[
P = 11.3 \, \text{hp} \times 550 \, \text{ft·lb/s per hp} = 6215 \, \text{ft·lb/s}.
\]

The pump lifts water at a rate of \( Q = 1 \, \text{ft}^3/\text{s} \), and the weight density of water is \( \rho = 62.4 \, \text{lb/ft}^3 \). The weight of water pumped per second is:

\[
\text{Weight per second} = Q \times \rho = 1 \, \text{ft}^3/\text{s} \times 62.4 \, \text{lb/ft}^3 = 62.4 \, \text{lb/s}.
\]

The power required to lift the water is equal to the weight per second multiplied by the depth \( h \) (in feet). Setting the available power equal to the required power:

\[
P = (\text{Weight per second}) \times h \quad \Rightarrow \quad 6215 \, \text{ft·lb/s} = 62.4 \, \text{lb/s} \times h.
\]

Solving for \( h \):

\[
h = \frac{6215}{62.4} \approx 99.6 \, \text{ft}.
\]

Among the given options, the closest value to \( h \approx 99.6 \, \text{ft} \) is \( 100 \, \text{ft} \), which corresponds to option E.
