Question:

A 24-year-old recent college graduate comes to the office because of a 3-year history of increased frequency of urination and occasional incontinence whenever she travels. She says the urinary symptoms typically begin a few days before she is going to fly and they stop the day after she arrives at her destination. She says she is anxious about flying and even slightly "panicky." She reports having had similar but milder symptoms prior to examinations before graduating. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination discloses no abnormalities. Urinalysis and urine culture are normal. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?

Options:

A: Recommend a diet change
B: Suggest a neurological examination
C: Recommend behavioral therapy
D: Review the patient's sexual history
E: Recommend that the patient avoid any stressful activities that cause the problem
F: Recommend a urinary incontinence medication
G: Recommend a physical therapy
H: Advise the patient to stop taking oral contraceptives
I: Recommend psychoanalytic psychotherapy

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The patient is a 24-year-old recent college graduate who presents with a 3-year history of increased frequency of urination and occasional incontinence when she travels. The symptoms start a few days before she flies and stop the day after arriving. She mentions being anxious about flying, even a bit panicky. She also had similar but milder symptoms before exams. Her medical history is otherwise unremarkable, only on oral contraceptives. Vitals are normal, physical exam shows nothing, urinalysis and culture are normal.

So, the question is asking what the next appropriate step is. The options are from A to J, but I need to focus on the given choices.

First, let's break down the case. The symptoms are urinary frequency and incontinence tied to specific situationsâ€”flying and exams. She's anxious about flying, which makes me think this is related to stress or anxiety. The fact that the symptoms resolve once she's done traveling suggests it's not a structural urinary issue because urinalysis and culture are normal. So, it's probably not a UTI or kidney stones or anything like that.

Her history of similar symptoms before exams also points towards anxiety-related issues. When people are stressed or anxious, they can experience various physical symptoms, including urinary issues. This sounds like it could be psychogenic or stress-induced.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Recommend a diet change. I don't see how diet would directly cause these symptoms in this context. Unless it's something like too much caffeine, but the symptoms are tied to stressors, not diet.

B: Suggest a neurological examination. Her physical exam is normal, and there's no indication of neurological deficits. The symptoms don't suggest a neurological cause like multiple sclerosis or spinal issues.

C: Recommend behavioral therapy. This makes sense if the issue is anxiety-related. Behavioral therapy, especially cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), can help address anxiety triggers.

D: Review the patient's sexual history. There's no indication of sexual issues here; the symptoms are related to travel and exams, not sexual activity.

E: Recommend avoiding stressful activities. While avoiding stress might help, it's not practical advice. She can't just stop traveling or taking exams, so this isn't the best long-term solution.

F: Recommend urinary incontinence medication. Since the urinalysis is normal and the issue is stress-related, medications like anticholinergics might not be the first choice. Plus, there's no indication of overactive bladder syndrome beyond the stress triggers.

G: Recommend physical therapy. Physical therapy for the pelvic floor could help with incontinence, but again, if it's stress-induced, the root cause is psychological, not physical.

H: Advise stopping oral contraceptives. There's no clear link between oral contraceptives and these urinary symptoms. Unless she's experiencing other side effects, which she isn't, this doesn't make sense.

I: Recommend psychoanalytic psychotherapy. While this is a form of therapy, it's more intensive and less commonly used as a first-line treatment compared to behavioral therapy, which is more targeted for anxiety.

So, putting it all together, the most appropriate next step seems to be recommending behavioral therapy. This would help her address the anxiety that's triggering her symptoms. The symptoms are clearly linked to stress and anxiety, so treating the underlying anxiety is key.

The patient is a 24-year-old with a history of urinary frequency and incontinence tied to stressful events like flying and exams. Her symptoms are clearly linked to anxiety, as they resolve once the stressor is removed. Normal urinalysis and physical exam rule out urinary tract issues, and her medical history doesn't suggest other causes. Behavioral therapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), is the most appropriate next step to address the underlying anxiety driving her symptoms.

Answer: C
