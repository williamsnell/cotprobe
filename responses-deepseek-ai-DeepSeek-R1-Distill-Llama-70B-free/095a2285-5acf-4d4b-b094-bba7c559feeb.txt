Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the amount of non-metal that will combine with a given mass of metal, and also determining the product formed when a certain amount of metal and non-metal react.

First, I'll read the problem again to make sure I get all the details. The metal has an atomic weight of 24, and the non-metal is 80. They react in a 1:2 ratio, metal to non-metal. So for every one atom of metal, two atoms of non-metal are needed.

The first part asks how many grams of non-metal will combine with 33.3 grams of metal. The second part says that if 1 gram of metal reacts with 5 grams of non-metal, how much product is produced. Hmm, wait, that second part might be a bit confusing. Let me clarify.

Wait, no, the second part says, "If 1 g of metal is reacted with 5 g of non-metal, find the amount of product produced." So this is a separate scenario, perhaps, or maybe it's connected to the first part. I'll keep that in mind as I go through the problem.

Let's tackle the first part first. We have 33.3 grams of metal. The metal's atomic weight is 24, so its molar mass is 24 g/mol. To find moles of metal, I'll divide the mass by molar mass: 33.3 g / 24 g/mol. Let me calculate that.

33.3 divided by 24 equals approximately 1.3875 moles of metal. Since the ratio is 1:2 (metal to non-metal), the moles of non-metal needed would be 2 times that. So 1.3875 * 2 = 2.775 moles of non-metal.

Now, the non-metal's atomic weight is 80, so each mole is 80 grams. Multiply moles by molar mass: 2.775 mol * 80 g/mol = 222 grams. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 222 as an option. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 33.3 divided by 24 again. 24 times 1 is 24, 24 times 1.3 is 31.2, and 1.3875 is 24 * (1 + 0.3875/1). Wait, 24 * 1.3875. Let me compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, 33.3 divided by 24. Let's see, 24 * 1 =24, subtract that from 33.3, we get 9.3. Then 9.3/24 is 0.3875. So yes, 1.3875 moles. Multiply by 2 gives 2.775 moles. 2.775 *80 = 222. So the non-metal needed is 222 grams. But none of the options match this exactly. Hmm, perhaps I should cross-check the options again.

Wait, looking at the options provided, option J is 220 grams, which is close but not exactly 222. Maybe I made a mistake in the ratio. Wait, the ratio is 1:2, metal to non-metal. So for each mole of metal, two moles of non-metal. So yes, 2.775 moles of non-metal. 2.775 *80 is 222g. So perhaps the correct answer isn't in the options, but wait, maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is different. Let me re-read. Oh wait, the ratio is 1 atom of metal to 2 atoms of non-metal. So the mole ratio is 1:2. So my calculation was correct. So perhaps the options are off, but let me see. Alternatively, maybe I should proceed to the second part to see if that clarifies anything.

The second part says that 1g of metal reacts with 5g of non-metal. So the mass ratio is 1g metal to 5g non-metal. Let's see what that ratio implies. The molar ratio would be (1/24) : (5/80). Let me compute that.

1/24 is approximately 0.04167 mol, and 5/80 is 0.0625 mol. So the ratio is 0.04167 : 0.0625, which simplifies to 2:3 when multiplied by 12 to eliminate denominators. Wait, 0.04167 is 1/24, and 0.0625 is 5/80 which is 1/16. So (1/24)/(1/16) = (16/24)= 2/3. So the ratio is 2:3, metal to non-metal. Wait, no, because 1g of metal reacts with 5g of non-metal, so the ratio by mass is 1:5. But the mole ratio is 1/24 :5/80. Let me compute that as a ratio.

1/24 :5/80 = (1/24)/(5/80) = (80)/(24*5) )= 80/120 = 2/3. So the mole ratio is 2:3 (metal:non-metal). But earlier, the problem states that the reaction is in a ratio of 1:2 atoms (metal:non-metal). That's confusing. So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. The problem states that the reaction happens in a 1:2 ratio of atoms, metal to non-metal. So each mole of metal reacts with 2 moles of non-metal. So that's a 1:2 molar ratio. But the second part says when 1g metal reacts with 5g non-metal, so that's a different scenario perhaps. Wait, maybe the second part is a separate question, not tied to the first. Let me read the question again.

Wait the question is: "how many grams of non-metal will combine with 33.3 g of metal. If 1 g of metal is reacted with 5 g of non-metal, find the amount of product produced."

So the first part is about the reaction based on the 1:2 molar ratio, and the second part is about a specific mass ratio leading to a product. Maybe they are separate problems, but perhaps they are connected. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the second part is a way to find the molar ratio. Let me see: If 1g of metal (molar mass 24) is 1/24 mol, and 5g of non-metal (molar mass 80) is 5/80 = 1/16 mol. So the mole ratio is (1/24) : (1/16) = (1/24) ÷ (1/16) )= 16/24 = 2/3. So the ratio is 2:3 (metal:non-metal) in moles. Wait, but this contradicts the initial ratio given in the problem, which is 1:2. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the reaction's stoichiometric ratio is 1:2, so the formula is M:N where M is metal, N is non-metal. So the formula would be MN2. So for every mole of M, 2 moles of N are needed. So the mole ratio is 1:2.

But then, in the second part, the mass ratio is 1g of M to 5g of N. So let's see what that implies in terms of moles. So 1g M is 1/24 mol, and 5g N is 5/80 = 1/16 mol. So the mole ratio here is (1/24) : (1/16) = (1/24)/(1/16) = 16/24 = 2/3. So the ratio is 2:3 (M:N). But according to the stoichiometry, it should be 1:2. So this suggests that the given mass ratio (1:5) corresponds to a different stoichiometric ratio, which is confusing. So perhaps the second part is a separate question, but maybe it's a way to find the molar masses or something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating things. Let me try to approach each part step by step.

First part: 33.3g of metal. Metal's molar mass is 24 g/mol. Moles of metal = 33.3 / 24 = 1.3875 mol. The reaction ratio is 1:2, so moles of non-metal needed = 2 * 1.3875 = 2.775 mol. Mass of non-metal = 2.775 * 80 = 222g. Looking at the options, the closest is option J:220g, but it's 222, which isn't present. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, 33.3 divided by 24 is 1.3875. Then 1.3875 *2 = 2.775. 2.775 *80 = 222g. None of the options have 222g. So perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check the atomic weights. The metal is 24, that's correct (like Mg). The non-metal is 80, which is perhaps sulfur (S is 32, but maybe it's something else like selenium, which is 78.96, close to 80). Anyway, the molar masses seem correct.

Wait, perhaps I misread the ratio. The problem says the ratio is 1 atom to 2 atoms, respectively. So for each metal atom, 2 non-metal atoms. So the formula would be M(N)2. So when calculating moles, yes, it's 1:2.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about the grams of non-metal in the first part, which I calculated as 222g, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I should proceed to the second part, maybe it's connected.

The second part says if 1g of metal reacts with 5g of non-metal, what's the product? So perhaps we can find the molar ratio from this mass ratio.

Wait, 1g metal is 1/24 mol. 5g non-metal is 5/80 = 1/16 mol. So the mole ratio is (1/24) : (1/16) = (1/24)/(1/16) = 16/24 = 2/3. So the ratio is 2:3, metal to non-metal. So that would imply a formula like M3N2, but that's conflicting with the initial ratio given as 1:2.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe the initial ratio was about moles, so perhaps I should use that to find the product mass. Wait, the question says that when 1g of metal reacts with 5g of non-metal, how much product is formed. So perhaps the product's mass is the sum of the reactants' masses. So 1g +5g =6g of product. But that seems too straightforward, and 6g is one of the options in part B, but the first part in B is 250g, which doesn't match my earlier calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this as a limiting reagent problem. Wait, but in the second part, it's given that 1g metal reacts with 5g non-metal. So maybe the product's mass is 6g. But that would be assuming 100% efficiency and that all reactants form product, which is a big assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the product's molar mass is the sum of the molar masses of metal and non-metal in the reaction.

Wait, so if the formula is M:N2, as per the initial ratio, then the molar mass would be 24 + 2*80 = 184 g/mol. Then, if 1g of metal reacts with some non-metal to form the product, perhaps we can find out how much product is formed.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to find the empirical formula based on the masses given in the second part. So 1g metal (24 g/mol) is 1/24 mol, and 5g non-metal (80 g/mol) is 5/80 = 1/16 mol.

So the mole ratio is (1/24) : (1/16) = (1/24) / (1/16) = 16/24 = 2/3. So the ratio is 2:3, metal to non-metal. So the formula would be M2N3. Then the molar mass of the product is 2*(24) +3*(80) =48 +240=288 g/mol.

Now, if 1g of metal and 5g of non-metal react, that's a total of 6g of reactants. But how much product is formed? Assuming they react completely, the product's mass would be 6g. But let's see, perhaps using stoichiometry.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate how many moles of product are formed. Since the reaction is 2 moles of M reacting with 3 moles of N to form 1 mole of product M2N3. Wait, no, the formula would be M2N3, so for every 2 moles of M and 3 moles of N, you get 1 mole of product.

In the second scenario, we have 1/24 mol of M and 1/16 mol of N. Let me see if these are in the correct stoichiometric ratio. The required ratio is 2:3 (M:N). Let's compute the actual ratio: (1/24) : (1/16) = (1/24)/(1/16) = 16/24 = 2/3. So yes, the ratio is correct. So all the reactants are consumed, and 1 mole of product is formed per 2 moles of M and 3 moles of N. So how many moles of product would form from 1/24 mol M and 1/16 mol N?

Let me set up the stoichiometry. The reaction is: 2M + 3N → M2N3.

So, moles of M present: 1/24. Moles of N present:1/16.

The stoichiometric ratio is 2:3. So let's see how much can react.

Moles of M needed per mole of reaction: 2. Moles of N needed:3.

So, for M: available =1/24, required per reaction=2. So how many reactions can occur? (1/24)/2 = 1/(48) reactions.

For N: available=1/16, required per reaction=3. So (1/16)/3 =1/(48) reactions.

So both are same; thus, all reactants are used up, and 1/48 moles of product are formed. Because per reaction, 1 mole of product is formed. So 1/48 moles.

Molar mass of product is 288 g/mol. So mass of product is (1/48)*288 =6 grams. So the product is 6 grams.

Wait, that's a straightforward calculation. So the product mass is 6g. Looking back at the options, let's check the second part of each option. The first part is grams of non-metal, the second is product. So looking for a product of 6g. Let me check the options:

Option A: product 5.85g.

Option B:6.25.

Option C:4.95.

Option D:5.25.

Option E:5.5.

Option F:6.5.

Option G:5.65.

Option H:5.

Option I:6.

Option J:5.75.

So the product is 6g, which is option I's second part (6g). But in the first part, we calculated 222g, but none of the options have that. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the first calculation.

Wait, maybe I should see which option has a product of 6g, which is option I, but its first part is 230g. Wait, but my first part calculation was 222g, which isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps I should re-examine the first part.

Wait, perhaps the initial ratio is 1:2 by mass, not moles. Wait, no, the problem states the ratio is in atoms, so it's moles. So I think my initial approach was correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is implying that the reaction is 1g of metal to 2g of non-metal. But that can't be, because the problem says the ratio is 1:2 atoms. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the first part uses the molar ratio, and the second part gives the mass ratio, allowing us to find the equivalent grams.

Wait, in the first part, 33.3g metal is 33.3/24 =1.3875 mol. So non-metal needed is 2.775 mol, which is 2.775 *80=222g. But the options don't have 222g, but option J is 220g, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is intended to be approximate.

Wait, 33.3g divided by 24 is exactly 1.3875 moles. 1.3875 *2=2.775. 2.775 *80=222g. So perhaps the intended answer is 222g, but it's not present. Let me look again at the options. Option J is 220g, which is close, but perhaps I should check if I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is inverted. The problem says 1 atom of metal to 2 atoms of non-metal. So for every mole of metal, 2 moles of non-metal. So my approach was correct.

Wait, perhaps the question's first part is to find the non-metal when 33.3g of metal is used, which is 222g, but none of the options match. So maybe I need to check if the options are referring to the product's mass instead of the non-metal's. No, the first part is about the non-metal's grams.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the 33.3g is the mass of the product, but that doesn't make sense. No, the question says 33.3g of metal.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed to look at the options. The second part's product is 6g, which is option I's second part. But option I's first part is 230g, which doesn't match my first part's calculation of 222g. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the second part.

Wait, perhaps in the second part, the product's mass isn't simply the sum. Let me think in terms of moles. The reaction is 2M + 3
