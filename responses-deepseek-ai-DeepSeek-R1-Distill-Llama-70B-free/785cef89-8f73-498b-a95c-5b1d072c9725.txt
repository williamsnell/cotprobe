Okay, so I need to find the volume of a solid that's cut out from a sphere of radius 2 by two parallel planes, each 1 unit away from the center. Hmm, right. I remember that when you cut a sphere with planes, you get a section called a spherical segment or a zone. 

Wait, the sphere has radius 2, right? So the distance from the center to each plane is 1 unit. That means the two planes are each 1 unit above and below the center, I guess. So the solid between them is like a sort of thick slice around the center.

I think the formula for the volume of a spherical segment (or the solid between two parallel planes cutting a sphere) is based on the height of the segment. Oh right, the formula I remember is V = (πh²)(3r - h)/3, where h is the height of the segment. But wait, is that correct? Or is there another approach?

Alternatively, maybe I should consider using the method of integration to find the volume. The sphere's equation is x² + y² + z² = r². Assuming the planes are perpendicular to the z-axis, their equations would be z = 1 and z = -1. So the limits of integration for z would be from -1 to 1.

So the volume can be found by integrating the area of circular slices along the z-axis. The radius of each slice at position z would be sqrt(r² - z²). Since r is 2, the radius at z is sqrt(4 - z²). The area of each slice is π*(4 - z²). So the volume would be the integral from z = -1 to z = 1 of π*(4 - z²) dz.

Let me compute that. The integral of 4 is 4z, and the integral of z² is (z^3)/3. So evaluating from -1 to 1:

At z=1: 4*(1) - (1)^3/3 = 4 - 1/3 = 11/3.
At z=-1: 4*(-1) - (-1)^3/3 = -4 - (-1/3) = -4 +1/3 = -11/3.
Subtracting, 11/3 - (-11/3) = 22/3. Then multiply by π, so the volume is (22/3)π.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 22π/3. That matches. Or wait, let me double-check my integration.

Wait, the integral of (4 - z²) from -1 to 1 is 2 times the integral from 0 to 1 because the function is even. So it's 2*( [4z - z³/3] from 0 to 1 ) = 2*(4*1 -1/3 -0) )= 2*(11/3) )= 22/3. Yep, so 22π/3.

Alternatively, using the spherical segment formula. The height h of the segment is the distance between the two planes. Since each is 1 unit from the center, h = 2 units. Then the formula is V = (πh²)(3r - h)/3. Plugging h=2 and r=2:

V = π*(4)*(6 - 2)/3 = π*4*(4)/3 = (16π)/3. Wait, that's option C, but earlier I got 22π/3. Hmm, which one is correct?

Wait wait, maybe I confused the formula. Let me think again. The formula for a spherical cap is (πh²)(3r - h)/3. But here, we have a segment (a zone) which is the region between two parallel planes. So perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, the correct formula for the volume between two planes at distances a and b from the center (a and b being negative if on opposite sides) is:

V = (π/3) [ (r + a)(2r - a)² - (r + b)(2r - b)² ] / something? Maybe I'm confusing it. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to stick with the integral approach, which I think is more reliable.

Wait, when I did the integral from -1 to 1, I calculated the volume as 22π/3, which is option A. But when I tried the spherical segment formula, I got 16π/3. So there's a discrepancy. I must have made a mistake in applying the spherical segment formula.

Wait, the spherical segment formula I remember is when you have a single plane cutting the sphere, creating a cap. So if you have two planes, you can compute the volume as the sum of two caps, but that might not be accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for a segment (which is the region between two planes) is derived from the difference between two spherical caps.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the sphere and find the volume between z=-1 and z=1.

The sphere's equation is x² + y² + z² = 4. So for any z, the radius in the xy-plane is sqrt(4 - z²). The area at height z is π(4 - z²). So integrating from z=-1 to 1, as before.

Wait, but another way to compute the volume between two planes is to find the volume of the sphere (which is (4/3)πr³ = (32/3)π) and subtract the volumes of the two caps above z=1 and below z=-1.

So each cap has height h. Wait, for z=1, the cap extends from z=1 to z=2. So the height of each cap is 1 (since radius is 2; cap height is the distance from the cutting plane to the top of the sphere).

The formula for a spherical cap's volume is V = (πh²)(3r - h)/3.

So for each cap, h=1, r=2. So each cap's volume is (π*(1)²)(3*2 -1)/3 = π*(5)/3. So each cap is 5π/3. There are two such caps (above and below), so total caps volume is 10π/3.

The volume of the solid between the planes is the sphere's volume minus the caps: (32π/3) - (10π/3) = 22π/3. So that's option A.

Wait, but earlier when I tried the spherical segment formula, I thought h was 2, and that gave 16π/3, which was conflicting. So perhaps I was using the wrong formula there.

So to clarify, the spherical segment between two planes distance h apart would have a volume found by subtracting the two caps from the sphere. So in this case, the total height between the two planes is 2 (from -1 to 1), and each cap beyond these planes has height 1. So the volume between the planes is sphere volume minus 2*(cap volume).

Which gives 32π/3 - 2*(5π/3) = 32π/3 - 10π/3 = 22π/3, which is option A.

So the correct answer should be 22π/3, which is option A.

To find the volume of the solid cut out from a sphere of radius 2 by two parallel planes, each 1 unit from the center, we can use the method of integration or the spherical cap formula. Here's the analysis:

1. **Sphere and Planes**: The sphere has a radius of 2, and the two parallel planes are located at \( z = 1 \) and \( z = -1 \). The solid between these planes is the region of the sphere where \( z \) ranges from -1 to 1.

2. **Integration Approach**:  
   The sphere's equation is \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 4 \). At any height \( z \), the radius of the circular cross-section is \( \sqrt{4 - z^2} \), and the area of the slice is \( \pi (4 - z^2) \). The volume is computed by integrating this area from \( z = -1 \) to \( z = 1 \):  
   \[
   V = \int_{-1}^{1} \pi (4 - z^2) \, dz
   \]  
   Evaluating the integral:  
   \[
   V = \pi \left[ 4z - \frac{z^3}{3} \right]_{-1}^{1}
   \]  
   At \( z = 1 \):  
   \[
   4(1) - \frac{(1)^3}{3} = 4 - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{11}{3}
   \]  
   At \( z = -1 \):  
   \[
   4(-1) - \frac{(-1)^3}{3} = -4 + \frac{1}{3} = -\frac{11}{3}
   \]  
   Subtracting these results:  
   \[
   V = \pi \left( \frac{11}{3} - \left(-\frac{11}{3}\right) \right) = \pi \cdot \frac{22}{3} = \frac{22\pi}{3}
   \]

3. **Spherical Cap Approach**:  
   The volume of the solid between the two planes can also be found by subtracting the volumes of the two spherical caps (above \( z = 1 \) and below \( z = -1 \)) from the total volume of the sphere.  
   - The total volume of the sphere is:  
     \[
     V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi (2)^3 = \frac{32\pi}{3}
     \]  
   - The height of each cap is \( h = 1 \), and the volume of one cap is given by:  
     \[
     V_{\text{cap}} = \frac{\pi h^2}{3} (3r - h)
     \]  
     Substituting \( h = 1 \) and \( r = 2 \):  
     \[
     V_{\text{cap}} = \frac{\pi (1)^2}{3} (6 - 1) = \frac{5\pi}{3}
     \]  
   - The total volume of the two caps is:  
     \[
     V_{\text{caps}} = 2 \cdot \frac{5\pi}{3} = \frac{10\pi}{3}
     \]  
   - The volume of the solid between the planes is:  
     \[
     V = V_{\text{sphere}} - V_{\text{caps}} = \frac{32\pi}{3} - \frac{10\pi}{3} = \frac{22\pi}{3}
     \]

4. **Conclusion**: Both methods yield the same result: the volume of the solid is \( \frac{22\pi}{3} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
