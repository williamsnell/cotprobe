Alright, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about using the principle of conservation of mechanical energy to find the velocity with which a body must be projected vertically upward to rise to a height equal to the Earth's radius, R. Hmm, okay.

First, I remember that the conservation of mechanical energy states that the total mechanical energy (which is the sum of kinetic and potential energy) remains constant if only conservative forces are doing work. Since the problem says there's no air resistance, that means only gravity is acting, which is a conservative force. So that should work.

Wait, but I also recall that gravitational potential energy can be a bit tricky when dealing with distances much larger than the Earth's radius. Oh right, when the distance is much smaller than Earth's radius, we can approximate the potential energy as U = mgh, but when moving to distances comparable to R, like in this case where the height is R, we need to use the more general form of gravitational potential energy.

So the general formula for gravitational potential energy is U = -G*M*m / r, where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the Earth, m is the mass of the object, and r is the distance from the center of the Earth.

The initial state is when the object is on the Earth's surface, so r_initial = R. The final state is when the object reaches a height h above the surface, which is R, so the final distance from the center is r_final = R + R = 2R.

At the initial point, the object has kinetic energy (1/2 m v^2) and potential energy (-G M m / R). At the highest point, the kinetic energy is zero because the object stops for an instant, and the potential energy is (-G M m / (2R)).

So applying conservation of energy, the initial total energy equals the final total energy.

So:

Initial energy: (1/2 m v^2) + (- G M m / R) = Final energy: 0 + (- G M m / (2R)).

Wait, the object's mass m should cancel out from both sides, so I can divide both sides by m to simplify.

So,

(1/2 v^2) - G M / R = - G M / (2 R)

Hmm, let me rearrange this equation to solve for v^2.

Bring the G M / R term to the right side:

(1/2 v^2) = G M / R - G M / (2 R)

Let's compute the right-hand side. G M / R is the same as 2 G M / (2 R), so subtracting G M/(2 R) gives [2 G M/(2 R) - G M/(2 R)] = G M/(2 R).

So,

1/2 v^2 = G M / (2 R)

Multiply both sides by 2:

v^2 = G M / R

Wait, no, wait. Wait, let me double-check that calculation. Because the RHS was G M (1/R - 1/(2 R))?

Wait, the initial equation after dividing by m is:

(1/2) v^2 - G M/R = - G M/(2 R)

So, moving the G M/R term to the other side:

(1/2) v^2 = G M/R - G M/(2 R) 

Which is G M/R (1 - 1/2) = G M/R * 1/2 

So,

(1/2) v^2 = (G M) / (2 R)

Multiply both sides by 2:

v^2 = G M / R

Then, take the square root:

v = sqrt( G M / R )

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see that. Let me look back at the options.

Option A is sqrt(G m_E / R). Oh wait, but in the options, it's m_E, which is the mass of the Earth, right? So if I have G M, where M is the Earth's mass, the option A has sqrt( G m_E / R ), which matches.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I correctly compute the potential energies?

Let me re-express the equation again.

At the surface, U_initial = - G M m / R.

At height R, U_final = - G M m / (2 R).

Kinetic energy at the surface is (1/2 m v^2), and zero at the top.

So the equation is:

(1/2 m v^2) + (- G M m / R) = (- G M m / 2 R)

Subtract the initial potential energy from both sides:

(1/2 m v^2) = ( - G M m/(2 R) ) + G M m/R 

Which is (G M m/R)( 1 - 1/2 ) ) = ( G M m/R )(1/2 )

So,

1/2 m v^2 = ( G M m )/(2 R )

Divide both sides by m:

1/2 v^2 = ( G M )/( 2 R )

Multiply both sides by 2:

v^2 = ( G M ) / R 

So v = sqrt( G M / R )

So the correct answer should be option A, which is sqrt(G m_E / R ), assuming that m_E is the Earth's mass.

Wait, but wait another thing. Oh, right! Because another formula for the escape velocity is v_escape = sqrt(2 G M / R), but that's for escaping Earth's gravity completely. But this problem is different. It's only going up to a height R, not to infinity.

Wait, but in this case, the velocity I've got is sqrt(G M / R), which is less than the escape velocity, which makes sense because you don't need the full escape velocity to just reach R height.

So looking at the options, option A is sqrt( G m_E / R ), which matches what I've found. So the correct answer is A.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, the gravitational potential energy is taken as U = mgh near the Earth's surface, but in this problem, since the height is significant (same as Earth's radius), using the general formula is correct.

So I think I'm confident that the answer is option A.

To solve the problem using the principle of conservation of mechanical energy, we equate the total mechanical energy at the initial point (Earth's surface) to the total mechanical energy at the final point (height equal to Earth's radius, \( R \)).

The total mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy. The initial kinetic energy is \( \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \), and the initial potential energy is \( -\frac{G M m}{R} \), where \( G \) is the gravitational constant, \( M \) is the Earth's mass, and \( m \) is the object's mass. At the highest point, the kinetic energy is zero, and the potential energy becomes \( -\frac{G M m}{2R} \).

Applying conservation of energy:

\[
\frac{1}{2} m v^2 - \frac{G M m}{R} = -\frac{G M m}{2R}.
\]

Dividing through by \( m \) (since \( m \neq 0 \)):

\[
\frac{1}{2} v^2 - \frac{G M}{R} = -\frac{G M}{2R}.
\]

Rearranging to solve for \( v^2 \):

\[
\frac{1}{2} v^2 = \frac{G M}{R} - \frac{G M}{2R}.
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side:

\[
\frac{1}{2} v^2 = \frac{G M}{2R}.
\]

Multiplying through by 2:

\[
v^2 = \frac{G M}{R}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{G M}{R}}.
\]

This matches the form of option A, which is \( \sqrt{\frac{G m_E}{R}} \), assuming \( m_E \) represents the Earth's mass (\( M \)).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**A: \( \sqrt{\frac{G m_E}{R}} \).**
