Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of these options has provided the most information about the structure of Earth's core, mantle, and lower crust. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Studies of the gravitational pull of the Earth. Hmm, I remember that gravity measurements can tell us about the density of different layers. Like, how the Earth's mass is distributed. But does that give detailed structure info? Maybe, but I'm not sure if it's the most.

Option B: Examination of flowing lava. Lava comes from volcanic activity, which I think is more about the upper mantle. But the core is deeper, and lava probably doesn't come from there. So maybe this tells us about the upper parts but not the whole structure.

Option C: Monitoring of Earth's tectonic plate movements. Tectonic plates move, which tells us about plate tectonics and the lithosphere. But how much does that reveal about the deeper layers like the core and mantle? Maybe some, but perhaps not the most detailed info.

Option D: Observations of volcanic eruptions. Similar to B, volcanoes give clues about the mantle, especially the upper mantle, but again, the core is much deeper. So probably not the best source for core info.

Option E: Inspection of surface rocks and minerals. Surface rocks are from the crust. They can tell us about the crust's composition, but the mantle and core are deeper. So this might not provide much about their structure.

Option F: Research on the composition of the atmosphere. The atmosphere is a different system; I don't think it tells us much about the Earth's internal structure. So probably not relevant here.

Option G: Studies of the speeds and travel paths of seismic waves passing through Earth. Oh right, seismic waves from earthquakes travel through the Earth. Different layers have different speeds and properties. Fast or slow waves can indicate the material they're passing through. So this must give a lot of info about the core, mantle, and lower crust. Like, P-waves and S-waves behave differently in solids vs liquids, which is how we know the outer core is liquid.

Option H: Collection of samples from deep boreholes drilled into Earth. Deep drilling can get us samples from the crust and maybe upper mantle, but I don't think we've drilled into the lower mantle or core. So limited info beyond a certain point.

Option I: Measurement of the intensity and fluctuations of Earth's magnetic field. The magnetic field is generated in the outer core, so this tells us about the core's activity. But does it give detailed structural info about all layers? Maybe some info, but perhaps not as comprehensive as seismic data.

Option J: Analysis of weather patterns and climate changes. Weather is about the atmosphere and surface, so probably doesn't tell us much about the internal structure.

Putting it all together, option G seems the best. Seismic waves have been instrumental in mapping the Earth's internal structure because their speed changes based on the material they pass through. For example, the discovery of the core was possible because seismic waves' behavior changed as they passed through different layers.

The correct answer is **G: Studies of the speeds and travel paths of seismic waves passing through Earth**. 

Seismic waves generated by earthquakes travel through Earth's interior, and their speeds and paths are influenced by the materials they encounter. By analyzing this data, scientists have been able to determine the existence and properties of the core, mantle, and lower crust. For instance, the behavior of P-waves and S-waves indicates whether they are passing through solid or liquid layers, which helped identify the liquid outer core. This method provides the most detailed and comprehensive information about Earth's internal structure.

Answer: G
