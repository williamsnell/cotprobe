Okay, so I've got this problem about coloring the vertices of a cube with two colors, and I need to find out how many distinct ways there are to do this, considering that rotations of the cube don't count as different colorings. Hmm, right, because if you can rotate one cube to look like another, they're considered the same. I remember something about group theory and Burnside's lemma being useful for counting distinct colorings under symmetry operations. Let me think about how to apply that here.

First, I should figure out the group of rotations for a cube. The cube has various symmetries: rotations around axes through faces, edges, and vertices. I think the cube has 24 rotational symmetries in total. Let me list them out. There are:

- The identity rotation (doing nothing).
- 90°, 180°, 270° rotations around the axes through the centers of opposite faces. There are 3 axes (x, y, z), so that's 3 rotations per axis, but not including the identity. So 3 axes × 3 non-zero rotations = 9?
Wait, no, wait. For each face axis, there are rotations by 90°, 180°, 270°, which are three non-identity rotations per axis. So 3 axes × 3 rotations each = 9, plus the identity makes 10 so far, but wait, I think I might be missing some other types of rotations.

Ah, right. There are also rotations around axes through opposite edges. Each such axis allows rotation by 180°, and there are 6 such axes (since each pair of opposite edges defines an axis). So that's 6 × 1 = 6 rotations.

And then, rotations around axes through opposite vertices. Each such axis allows 120° and 240° rotations. There are 4 such axes (wait, no, is it 4?), but wait, actually, cubes have four space diagonals, but each rotation axis goes through two opposite vertices. Wait, how many such axes are there? Oh, right, it's four choose two, but wait, no, it's four space diagonals, but each pair of opposite vertices defines an axis. So for a cube, there are four space diagonals, but each axis is defined by a pair. So how many such axes? Let me think: a cube has 4 space diagonals, but each axis is a line through two opposite vertices. So the number of such axes is actually 4 choose 2, but wait no, each axis is determined by two opposite vertices, so the number of such axes is 4/2 = 2? No, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait. For a cube, the number of axes through opposite vertices is 4, because each pair of opposite vertices (there are 8 vertices, so 4 pairs) defines an axis. For example, the axis going through (1,1,1) and (-1,-1,-1) in a cube centered at the origin. But wait, in reality, the cube has 4 space diagonals, but each rotation axis uses one space diagonal. So I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps there are four such axes, each allowing for 120° and 240° rotations. So that's 4 axes × 2 rotations each (120 and 240), totaling 8 rotations.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to recount all the rotational symmetries of a cube. The cube has:

- Identity: 1
- 90°, 180°, 270° rotations about face axes: 3 axes × 3 rotations each = 9
- 180° rotations about edge axes: 6 axes × 1 rotation each = 6
- 120° and 240° rotations about vertex axes: 4 axes × 2 rotations each = 8

Wait, but 1 + 9 + 6 + 8 = 24, which matches the total number of rotational symmetries. So that seems correct.

But wait, in some references, the rotations around the face axes are 6 in total: for each of the 3 axes, rotations of 90°, 180°, and 270°, which is 3 rotations per axis, 3×3=9. Then edge rotations: 6 axes (each through the midpoints of opposite edges) with 180° rotation each, so 6. And vertex rotations: 4 axes (each through a pair of opposite vertices) with 120° and 240° rotations, so 4×2=8. So 1+9+6+8=24. Yep, that adds up.

So the rotation group has 24 elements. Now, Burnside's lemma says that the number of distinct colorings is equal to the average number of colorings fixed by each group element. So I need to compute, for each type of rotation, how many colorings are fixed by that rotation, sum them all up, and then divide by 24.

So the cube has 8 vertices, each to be colored with two colors (say, black and white). Without considering rotations, the total number of colorings is 2^8 = 256. But we need to consider colorings up to rotation, so applying Burnside's lemma.

The plan is to categorize each rotation and compute the number of colorings fixed by that rotation.

So let's go through each type of rotation and compute the fixed colorings.

1. Identity rotation: Every coloring is fixed by the identity. So the number here is 2^8 = 256.

2. 90° and 270° rotations about face axes: These are rotations by 90° and 270°, which are the same in terms of cycle structure as 90°, because 270° is the inverse of 90°, but in terms of permutation cycles, they have the same structure.

Each such rotation cycles four vertices around the face. So for a 90° rotation about, say, the z-axis, the four side vertices (not on the top or bottom face) form a single 4-cycle, while the top and bottom face centers are fixed. Wait, no: wait, the cube's vertices are all the corners, so each face has four vertices. Wait, no. Let me clarify: a cube has 8 vertices. Each face has four vertices, and the rotation about a face axis (like the z-axis through the centers of top and bottom faces) will rotate four vertices in a cycle. So each 90° rotation around a face axis will decompose the vertices into two cycles of four vertices each? No, wait, no. Wait, the rotation about the face axis by 90° cycles four vertices around that face and also the four vertices around the opposite face? Or wait, no. Let me think: when you rotate the cube 90 degrees around the z-axis (imagine looking at the top face), the four side vertices (the ones on the top face) rotate among themselves, and the four side vertices on the bottom face also rotate among themselves. So each 90° rotation about a face axis causes two separate 4-cycles in the permutation of the vertices.

Wait, but each face's four vertices form a single 4-cycle when rotated. So, a 90° rotation would have two cycles of length 4 each. So the permutation induced on the vertices by a 90° face rotation has two cycles of length 4.

Wait, perhaps I should draw this mentally. Imagine the cube with top face ABCD and bottom face EFGH, with A above E, B above F, etc. Rotating the cube 90° around the vertical (z) axis would cycle A→B→C→D→A, and E→F→G→H→E. So yes, two 4-cycles.

So for a rotation of 90° or 270°, the permutation consists of two 4-cycles.

Now, for a coloring to be fixed under this rotation, all the vertices in each cycle must have the same color. Because after rotation, each vertex moves to the position of the next in the cycle. So for the coloring to be fixed, all vertices in each 4-cycle must be the same color.

So each 4-cycle must be monochromatic. Since there are two 4-cycles, each can be independently colored. So the number of fixed colorings for a 90° or 270° rotation is 2^2 = 4.

3. 180° rotations about face axes: These have a different cycle structure. A 180° rotation about a face axis would cause each pair of opposite vertices in the face to swap. So for example, in the top face, A swaps with C, and B swaps with D. Similarly, in the bottom face, E swaps with G, and F swaps with H. So each rotation decomposes into four 2-cycles.

Wait, no: Wait, a 180° rotation around the face axis would cause each of the four vertices on the top face to rotate 180°, so A→C and C→A, B→D and D→B. Similarly, E→G and G→E, F→H and H→F. So the permutation is four 2-cycles.

So for a coloring to be fixed under this rotation, the two vertices in each 2-cycle must have the same color. So each 2-cycle must be monochromatic.

Now, how many independent choices do we have? There are four 2-cycles, each consisting of two vertices. So the number of colorings fixed by a 180° face rotation is 2^4 = 16.

Wait, because each 2-cycle can be colored independently. So four 2-cycles, each with two choices, so 2^4 = 16.

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, in each 2-cycle, the two vertices must have the same color. So for each 2-cycle, you choose a color (two options) for both vertices in the pair. So the total is 2^number_of_2-cycles. Since there are four 2-cycles, it's 2^4 = 16.

4. 180° rotations about edge axes: These rotations are about an axis that goes through the midpoints of opposite edges. Let me think about the effect on the cube's vertices. Each such rotation swaps two pairs of opposite vertices and leaves two vertices fixed? Or perhaps it creates 2-cycles. Hmm, maybe I should visualize this.

Wait, no. Let me consider an edge axis. For example, take the axis going through the midpoints of the front-top and back-bottom edges. A 180° rotation about this axis would swap certain vertices. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how the rotation affects each vertex.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to note that a 180° rotation about an edge axis would decompose the vertices into four 2-cycles. Because each 180° rotation is order 2, so each cycle must be of length 1 or 2. But a rotation about an edge axis can't fix any vertex because the axis doesn't pass through any vertex. So all vertices must be in 2-cycles. Therefore, the permutation caused by a 180° edge rotation consists of four 2-cycles.

Wait, but wait: 8 vertices, each in 2-cycles, so 4 cycles. So for a coloring to be fixed under this rotation, each pair in the 2-cycle must have the same color. Thus, again, the number of fixed colorings is 2^4 = 16.

Wait, but I'm a bit uncertain about the exact cycle structure. Let me think again: For a rotation about an edge axis, perhaps each vertex is part of a 2-cycle. So each 2-cycle must have the same color. So yes, 2^4 = 16.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of a specific example. Take the axis through the midpoints of the front and back edges on the top face. Wait, perhaps it's the axis through the midpoints of front and back edges, but on the same face. No, perhaps it's better to think about the axis through the midpoints of two opposite edges, like front-top and back-bottom edges.

Upon a 180° rotation about this axis, each vertex is mapped to another vertex. Let's say vertex A is swapped with vertex C, B with D, E with G, and F with H. Wait, but that might not be accurate. Alternatively, perhaps each rotation causes two pairs of vertices to swap, and the other two pairs to swap as well. But regardless, the result is four 2-cycles. So fixed colorings require each 2-cycle to be same color, so 2^4 = 16.

Wait, but I'm not 100% confident about that. Another approach: perhaps the 180° rotation about an edge axis will cause two pairs of opposite vertices to swap, but I might be getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the rotation causes four 2-cycles, so 2^4 colorings.

Alternatively, perhaps each 180° edge rotation causes two 2-cycles and two fixed points, but that doesn't seem right because the axis doesn't pass through any vertices. Hmm, maybe I should double-check.

Wait, perhaps the 180° rotation about an edge axis actually results in two 2-cycles and two fixed points. No, that can't be because the rotation axis is through the midpoints of edges, not through any vertices, so no vertex is fixed. So all 8 vertices are involved in 2-cycles, making four 2-cycles. So the number of fixed colorings is 2^4 = 16.

5. 120° and 240° rotations about vertex axes: These are rotations about an axis going through two opposite vertices. Let's say the axis goes through vertex A and its opposite vertex (maybe G, depending on labeling). A 120° rotation would cycle three vertices around A and three around G. Let me think about how the vertices are permuted.

Wait, a 120° rotation about a vertex axis would cycle three adjacent vertices around each end. For example, imagine holding the cube by two opposite vertices (say, top and bottom). A 120° rotation would cause the three vertices around the top to cycle among themselves, and the three around the bottom to cycle as well. So the permutation would consist of two 3-cycles.

Wait, but wait, 8 vertices: 3 + 3 = 6, so there are two more vertices. Oh, wait, no. The rotation about a vertex axis (through two opposite vertices) leaves those two vertices fixed, and the other six form two 3-cycles. Wait, that makes sense. So the permutation for a 120° or 240° rotation about a vertex axis would consist of two fixed points and two 3-cycles.

Wait, no: 120° rotation about a vertex axis (like from vertex A to vertex G) would rotate three vertices around A and three around G. So maybe the permutation is two 3-cycles. Let me think again: 8 vertices, two are fixed (A and G), and the other six are divided into two 3-cycles. But 3+3 =6, plus 2 fixed makes 8. So yes, two 3-cycles and two fixed points.

Wait, no, no, that can't be. Because 3+3=6 plus 2 fixed points would sum to 8, but each 3-cycle involves three vertices. So, the two fixed points are A and G, and the other six are in two 3-cycles.

So, for a 120° rotation, the permutation would consist of two 3-cycles and two fixed points.

Wait, but 120° and 240° rotations are different. 120° is a cycle of length 3, and 240° is its inverse, which is also a 3-cycle. So each such rotation would cause the same cycle structure: two 3-cycles and two fixed points.

Now, for a coloring to be fixed under such a rotation, the vertices in each 3-cycle must all have the same color, and the fixed points can be colored arbitrarily.

So for each 3-cycle, all three vertices must be the same color. The two fixed points can each be colored independently.

Thus, the number of fixed colorings is 2^2 (for the two 3-cycles) × 2^2 (for the two fixed points) = 2^(2+2) = 16.

Wait, let me see: each 3-cycle must have all three vertices the same color. So for each 3-cycle, one choice (either color 1 or color 2). And each fixed point can be colored either color, independently. So number of fixed colorings is 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 16.

Wait, that seems correct. So each 120° and 240° rotation about a vertex axis fixes 16 colorings.

Now, let me summarize:

- Identity: 1 element, fixes 256 colorings.
- 90° and 270° face rotations: There are 6 such rotations (3 axes × 2 directions). Each fixes 4 colorings. So 6 × 4 = 24.
- 180° face rotations: 3 axes, each contributing one rotation. Each fixes 16 colorings. So 3 ×16 = 48.
- 180° edge rotations: 6 axes, each contributing one rotation. Each fixes 16 colorings. So 6 ×16 = 96.
- 120° and 240° vertex rotations: 8 rotations (4 axes × 2 directions). Each fixes 16 colorings. So 8 ×16 = 128.

Wait, let me list all group elements:

- Identity: 1
- 90° face: 6 (3 axes × 2 directions)
- 180° face: 3
- 180° edge: 6
- 120° and 240° vertex: 8

So 1+6+3+6+8=24, which adds up correctly.

Now, compute the total fixed colorings:

Identity: 1 × 256 = 256

90° and 270° face rotations: 6 ×4 = 24 → total 24
180° face: 3 ×16 = 48 → total 48
180° edge: 6 ×16 = 96 → total 96
120° and 240° vertex: 8 ×16 = 128 → total 128

Now, sum all the fixed colorings:

256 (identity) + 24 (face 90/270) + 48 (face 180) + 96 (edge 180) + 128 (vertex 120/240) 

Let me compute that:

256 +24 = 280

280 +48 = 328

328 +96 = 424

424 +128 = 552

So total fixed colorings sum to 552.

Now, according to Burnside's lemma, the number of distinct colorings is this sum divided by the order of the group, which is 24.

So 552 ÷24 = ?

Let me compute: 24 ×23 = 552 (since
