Question:

A previously healthy 15-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department in August 1 hour after the onset of headache, dizziness, nausea, and one episode of vomiting. His symptoms began during the first hour of full-contact football practice in full uniform. He reported feeling weak and faint but did not lose consciousness. He vomited once after drinking water. On arrival, he is diaphoretic. He is not oriented to person, place, or time. His temperature is 39.5°C (103.1°F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 90/65 mm Hg. Examination, including neurologic examination, shows no other abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:

A: Administer an epinephrine injection
B: Administer oxygen via a nasal cannula
C: Perform a lumbar puncture
D: Immerse the patient in an ice water bath
E: Apply cold compresses to the forehead
F: Obtain a CT scan of the head
G: Administer a dose of ibuprofen
H: Administer intravenous fluids
I: Administer sodium chloride tablets
J: Administer a glucose injection

Okay, so I've got this question here about a 15-year-old boy who's come to the emergency department with some symptoms. Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I might need to think it through carefully.

The boy is previously healthy, so no known medical issues. His symptoms started during full-contact football practice in full uniform on August 1st. That makes me think it's summer, maybe hot outside. He started feeling headache, dizziness, nausea, and vomited once after drinking water. He felt weak and faint but didn't pass out. On arrival, he's diaphoretic, which means sweating a lot. His vital signs are temp 39.5°C (which is high, like 103.1°F), pulse 120, respirations 40, and BP 90/65. Those are all elevated, except the BP is a bit low. The exam, including neurological, shows no other abnormalities. So no signs of injury or other issues.

The question is asking what's the most appropriate next step in management. The options are from A to J.

First, I should figure out what's going on. The scenario sounds like heat-related illness because he was practicing in full uniform in the heat. The high temperature, sweating, and symptoms like headache, dizziness point towards heat exhaustion or heat stroke.

Wait, heat exhaustion vs heat stroke. Heat exhaustion is when the body temp is elevated but the person is still able to sweat and hasn't lost consciousness. Heat stroke is more severe, with body temp over 40°C (104°F), and the person might lose consciousness or have neurological symptoms. But this boy's temp is 39.5°C, so just under that. Hmm, but he's not oriented—confused. That suggests maybe heat stroke, since confusion is a neurological symptom.

But wait, I thought heat stroke can be present even without the temp being super high if there are central nervous system symptoms. So maybe he's in heat stroke.

So management for heat stroke typically involves cooling the patient. The mainstay is to lower the body temperature as quickly as possible. So the options involve cooling methods.

Looking at the options:

A: Epinephrine injection—usually for anaphylaxis, not sure how that applies here.

B: Oxygen via nasal cannula—probably a good idea since he might be having some respiratory issues, but is it the most appropriate next step?

C: Lumbar puncture—maybe if there's suspicion of meningitis, but his high temp and symptoms are more pointing to heat stroke. Plus, no other neuro signs except confusion.

D: Ice water bath immersion—this is a common method to rapidly cool someone with heat stroke. It's an aggressive method.

E: Cold compresses to forehead—less effective than immersion, but might be done if immersion isn't possible.

F: CT scan of the head—maybe if they suspect a head injury or something else, but he was practicing football, not necessarily a trauma. Plus, no other neuro signs except confusion.

G: Ibuprofen—that's for pain and inflammation, but in heat stroke, it's not indicated. Also, NSAIDs might not be the best in acute heat stroke.

H: IV fluids—probably important for hydration, as heat stroke can cause dehydration. But is this the immediate next step?

I: Sodium chloride tablets—those are for electrolytes, but not sure if that's the priority here.

J: Glucose injection—maybe if hypoglycemia is suspected, but his symptoms don't point to that. He did vomit after drinking water, but nothing about low blood sugar signs.

So putting it all together, the priority is to lower his body temperature as quickly as possible. The standard approach is to immerse in ice water if possible. But I've also heard that sometimes in emergency settings, they might use other methods if immersion isn't available. But in this case, the best option would be D: ice water bath.

Wait, but another thought—should they also give IV fluids? Option H. Because dehydration is a big part of heat stroke, so IV fluids help with hydration and cooling. But the first step is to start cooling.

So the immediate next step would be to cool him down. So between D and other options, D seems the best choice.

Alternatively, some might say that applying cold compresses is a first step, but immersion is more effective. So D is better.

Other options: Administering oxygen (B) is probably done too, but not the next step.

So the answer should be D.
</think>

The patient is a 15-year-old boy with symptoms consistent with heat stroke, including high fever (39.5°C), confusion, diaphoresis, tachycardia, and low blood pressure. These symptoms occurred during intense physical activity in hot weather, further supporting heat stroke. The primary goal in managing heat stroke is rapid cooling to prevent further neurological damage and other complications.

Among the options provided:

- **D: Immerse the patient in an ice water bath** is the most appropriate next step, as it is a well-established and effective method for rapidly lowering body temperature in heat stroke.
- Other options, such as administering oxygen (B) or IV fluids (H), are important but secondary to immediate cooling.
- Options like epinephrine (A), ibuprofen (G), or sodium chloride tablets (I) are not relevant to the acute management of heat stroke.
- Cold compresses (E) are less effective than immersion but could be used if immersion is not available.

Given the severity of heat stroke and the need for rapid intervention, immersion in an ice water bath is the best choice.

Answer: D
