Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the minimum vertex cover of a graph. Hmm, let me try to remember what a vertex cover is. From my studies, I recall that a vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. So, every edge has at least one endpoint in the vertex cover.

The graph given here is undirected, and the edges are E = {<0,3>, <1,3>, <2,3>}. So, let me visualize this. It looks like node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2. So the graph structure is like a star with node 3 in the center connected to the other three nodes.

Wait, so the graph has four nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3. The edges are all connecting to 3. So each of 0, 1, 2 is connected only to 3, and there are no other edges.

Now, the question is to find the minimum vertex cover. I need to find the smallest possible set of nodes such that every edge is covered.

Let me think about the possible options. Since every edge is between 3 and another node, perhaps choosing node 3 would cover all edges. Because if I select node 3, then every edge (0-3, 1-3, 2-3) is covered by 3. So the vertex cover would just be [3], right? Because selecting 3 alone covers all the edges.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Are there any other edges that I'm not considering? The problem states that E has exactly those three edges. So the graph is simple, no other edges. So yes, choosing 3 would cover all edges.

But wait, what if I don't pick 3? Then I have to pick all the other nodes, because each edge is connected to 0, 1, or 2. So if I don't pick 3, I have to pick 0, 1, and 2. That gives a vertex cover of [0,1,2], but that's three nodes, which is larger than just picking 3.

So the minimum vertex cover would be just [3], which is the smallest possible set. So the correct option should be F: [3].

Wait, let me check the options again. Option F is [3], which matches my conclusion. So that's the answer.

The problem involves finding the minimum vertex cover of an undirected graph \( G \) with edges \( E = \{<0,3>, <1,3>, <2,3>\} \). A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set.

The graph consists of four nodes: 0, 1, 2, and 3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2, forming a star-like structure. To determine the minimum vertex cover, we analyze the edges:

1. Every edge in the graph is connected to node 3. Therefore, selecting node 3 alone covers all edges: \( <0,3>, <1,3>, <2,3> \).
2. If node 3 is not selected, all other nodes (0, 1, and 2) would need to be included in the vertex cover to cover the edges, resulting in a larger set of three nodes.

Thus, the smallest vertex cover is simply \( [3] \), as it covers all edges with the fewest nodes. This corresponds to option F.

Answer: F
