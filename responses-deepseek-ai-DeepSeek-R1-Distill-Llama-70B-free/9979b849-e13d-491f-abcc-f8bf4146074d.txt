Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here, and I need to figure out the range, variance, and standard deviation from a dataset. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the dataset provided is: 2, 3, 0, 4, 1, 3, 0. Wait, wait, hold on—there are seven numbers here. Oh, right, the question says eight households, so maybe I'm missing one. Let me count again. 2,3,0,4,1,3,0. That's seven data points. Hmm, maybe I misread. Oh wait, maybe I missed a number. Let me check again. Oh, no, the list is correct as given—seven numbers. Wait, no, the problem says eight households. Oh wait, maybe it's a typo? Or perhaps I miscounted. Let me recount: 2,3,0,4,1,3,0—no, that's seven. So maybe the problem has an error, but I'll proceed with what's given.

Wait, no, looking again: the numbers are 2,3,0,4,1,3,0. Oh wait, wait a minute—maybe there are eight numbers. Let me count each comma. Let's see: 2, then 3 (1), 0 (2), 4 (3), 1 (4), 3 (5), 0 (6). Oh, wait, that's six commas, meaning seven numbers. So maybe the problem actually has seven data points, perhaps a typo in the question stating eight households. Well, I'll proceed with the data given.

Now, the first thing to find is the range. The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values in the dataset. So looking at the numbers: the highest is 4, and the lowest is 0. So 4 minus 0 equals 4. So the range is 4. That's straightforward.

Next is the variance. Variance is a measure of how spread out the numbers are. To calculate variance, I first need to find the mean of the dataset. The mean is the average, so I sum all the numbers and divide by the number of data points.

Let's add them up: 2 + 3 is 5, plus 0 is 5, plus 4 is 9, plus 1 is 10, plus 3 is 13, plus 0 is 13. So total sum is 13. There are 7 data points, so mean is 13 divided by 7. Let me calculate that: 13/7 is approximately 1.857. Let me write it as 13/7 for exactness.

Now, for each data point, I subtract the mean and square the result, then find the average of those squares. That gives the variance.

So let's compute each term:

First number: 2. 2 - (13/7) = (14/7 -13/7) = 1/7. Square is (1/7)^2 = 1/49 ≈ 0.0204.

Second: 3 -13/7 = (21/7 -13/7) =8/7. Square is (64/49) ≈1.3061.

Third: 0 -13/7 = (-13/7). Square is (169/49) ≈3.4489.

Fourth:4 -13/7= (28/7 -13/7)=15/7. Square is 225/49 ≈4.5918.

Fifth:1 -13/7 = (7/7 -13/7)= -6/7. Square is 36/49≈0.7347.

Sixth:3 - same as second, which is 8/7. Square again 64/49.

Seventh:0, same as third. Square is 169/49.

Now, sum all these squared differences.

Let me list them:

1/49 ≈0.0204

64/49≈1.3061

169/49≈3.4489

225/49≈4.5918

36/49≈0.7347

64/49≈1.3061

169/49≈3.4489

Adding these up:

Let me compute each term as fractions to be precise.

Sum = (1 + 64 + 169 + 225 + 36 + 64 + 169) /49

Compute numerator:

1 +64=65; +169=234; +225=459; +36=495; +64=559; +169=728.

So numerator is 728. So sum of squares is 728/49.

Wait, 49 * 14 = 686. 49*15=735. So 728 is 49*14 + 42. 42/49 is 6/7. So 14 and 6/7. Wait, but 728 divided by 49: let me compute 49*14=686. 728-686=42. 42/49 is 6/7. So 14.857 approximately.

So sum of squared differences is 728/49.

Now, variance is the average of these squared differences. Since this is a sample, not the entire population, we use sample variance, which divides by (n-1) instead of n.

n is 7, so n-1=6.

So variance = (728/49) /6 = (728)/(49*6) = 728/294.

Simplify this fraction. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 2: 364/147.

Wait, 147 is 49*3, 49 is 7^2. Let me see if 364 and 147 have a common factor. 147 is 3*49. 364 divided by 7: 364/7=52. So 364=7*52. And 147=7*21. So we can factor out 7.

So 364/147 = (52)/(21) = approximately 2.476. Wait, 52 divided by 21 is 2 and 10/21, which is about 2.476.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the sum of squared differences. Did I add correctly earlier?

Wait, the sum was 1 +64 +169 +225 +36 +64 +169.

1+64=65; 65+169=234; 234+225=459; 459+36=495; 495+64=559; 559+169=728. So that's correct.

So variance is 728/(49*6) = 728/294 = 364/147 = 52/21 ≈2.476.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them exactly match this. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option E has a variance of 2, and option C has 2.2. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial sum of the data. Let me recount the sum of the data points. The dataset is 2,3,0,4,1,3,0.

2 +3=5; +0=5; +4=9; +1=10; +3=13; +0=13. Yes, sum is 13.

Mean is 13/7, correct.

Now, each (x - mean)^2:

Let me recompute each term:

2: (2 -13/7) = (14/7 -13/7)=1/7. Squared: 1/49.

3: (21/7 -13/7)=8/7. Squared:64/49.

0: -13/7. Squared:169/49.

4: 28/7-13/7=15/7. 225/49.

1: 7/7-13/7= -6/7. 36/49.

3: same as before:64/49.

0: same as before:169/49.

Adding these:

1 + 64 + 169 + 225 + 36 + 64 + 169 = 728. So that's correct.

So sum is 728, divided by 49 gives 14.857. Then divided by 6: 14.857/6 ≈2.476.

So variance is approximately 2.476, which is around 2.48.

Looking at the options, the closest variances are option E (2), option C (2.2), and option I (3). Hmm, none of the options exactly match this. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try another approach.

Alternatively, maybe the data has eight points, and I miscounted. Let me re-examine the question. Oh wait, the question says eight households, but the data given is seven numbers: 2,3,0,4,1,3,0. That's seven. So perhaps the correct data has eight numbers, but the way it's written is a bit confusing. Let me check again.

Oh wait, perhaps the data is 2,3,0,4,1,3,0, and another number I missed. Let me read the question again: "The survey yielded the following results: 2, 3, 0, 4, 1, 3, 0." So it's seven numbers. Hmm, but the question says eight households. That's confusing. Maybe it's a typo, and the data is correct as seven.

But if I proceed with seven data points, the variance is approximately 2.476, which doesn't match any of the options exactly. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option E: Range 4, Variance 2, SD 1.414.

Option C: Range 4, Variance 2.2, SD 1.483.

Option I: Range 4, Variance 3, SD 1.732.

Option B: Range 3, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mean. Let me recalculate the mean with seven data points.

Sum is 13, n=7. 13/7 is approximately 1.8571.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the variance as a decimal more accurately.

So the sum of squares is 728/49. Let me compute that as a decimal:

49 ×14=686, so 728-686=42. So 728/49=14 +42/49=14.8571.

Then, variance is 14.8571 divided by 6 (since n=7, sample variance uses n-1=6).

14.8571 /6 = approximately 2.476.

Hmm, so variance is about 2.476, which is approximately 2.48.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C, which has variance 2.2, and E has 2.0.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial count of the data. Let me check again. The data is 2,3,0,4,1,3,0—seven numbers. So n=7.

Wait, wait a minute. Maybe the survey was distributed to eight households, but one didn't respond, so there are seven data points. So n=7.

Alternatively, perhaps the data is 2,3,0,4,1,3,0, and another number, making it eight. Let me check the question again. The question says "results: 2, 3, 0, 4, 1, 3, 0." So seven numbers. So perhaps the correct approach is to proceed with seven data points.

But let's think differently. Maybe the data is 2,3,0,4,1,3,0—seven numbers. But perhaps when I calculated the sum of squares, I made an error. Let me recompute each term.

Compute (x_i - mean)^2 for each x_i:

x = 2: (2-13/7)^2 = (1/7)^2 = 1/49 ≈0.020408163

x=3: (3 -13/7)= 8/7 → squared 64/49≈1.306122449

x=0: (0-13/7)= -13/7 → squared 169/49≈3.448979592

x=4: (4-13/7)=15/7 → squared 225/49≈4.591836735

x=1: (1-13/7)= -6/7 → squared 36/49≈0.734693878

x=3: same as previous 3. So 64/49≈1.306122449

x=0: same as previous 0. So 169/49≈3.448979592

Now, summing all these up:

0.020408163 +1.306122449 ≈1.326530612

+3.448979592 →4.775510204

+4.591836735 →9.367346939

+0.734693878 →10.102040817

+1.306122449 →11.408163266

+3.448979592 →14.857142858

So the sum of squared differences is approximately14.857142858.

Divide by n-1=6: 14.857142858/6 ≈2.476190476.

So variance is approximately 2.476, which is about 2.48.

Looking at the options, none of them have exactly 2.48. But let's look at the options again.

Option E: Variance 2, SD 1.414.

Option C: Variance 2.2, SD 1.483.

Option I: Variance 3, SD 1.732.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the sum of squares. Alternatively, maybe the question uses population variance (divided by n) instead of sample variance (divided by n-1). Let me see.

If I calculate population variance, dividing by n=7, then variance = 14.8571 /7 ≈2.1224.

That's approximately 2.12, which is close to option C's variance of 2.2.

But the question says it's a sample from eight households, so it's a sample, not the entire population. So sample variance should be used, which is divided by n-1.

Wait, but there's a confusion here. The question says the survey was distributed to eight households, but the data has seven. So perhaps it's a sample of eight, but one is missing. Alternatively, maybe the data is correct as seven, but the question mistakenly says eight.

Alternatively, perhaps I should treat it as a population, not a sample. Let me try that.

If the dataset is considered as the entire population (maybe all the data collected), then variance would be sum of squares divided by n=7.

So 14.8571 /7 ≈2.1224, which is about 2.12. That's close to option C's 2.2, but not exact.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the sum of the data. Let me recount the data sum.

Data: 2 +3 +0 +4 +1 +3 +0.

2+3=5; +0=5; +4=9; +1=10; +3=13; +0=13. So sum is 13, correct.

Mean is 13/7 ≈1.8571.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct variance is approximately 2.476, but none of the options match exactly. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option E: Range 4, Variance 2, SD sqrt(2)=1.414.

Option C: Range 4, Variance 2.2, SD approx 1.483.

Option H: Range 4, Variance 1.5, SD 1.225.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the sum of squares.

Let me compute the sum again, but using fractions.

Each (x_i - mean)^2:

2: (2 -13/7)^2 = (1/7)^2 = 1/49.

3: (8/7)^2 =64/49.

0: ( -13/7)^2=169/49.

4: (15/7)^2=225/49.

1: (-6/7)^2=36/49.

3:64/49.

0:169/49.

So sum is (1 +64 +169 +225 +36 +64 +169)/49.

Compute numerator: 1 +64=65; 65+169=234; 234+225=459; 459+36=495; 495+64=559; 559+169=728. So 728/49=14.8571.

So variance = 14.8571/(7-1)=14.8571/6≈2.476.

So sample variance is ~2.476.

Standard deviation is the square root of variance, so sqrt(2.476) ≈1.573.

Looking at the options, let's check which ones have a variance close to 2.476 and standard deviation around 1.573.

Looking:

Option B: Variance 2.5, SD ~1.581.

Option E: Variance 2, SD 1.414.

Option C: Variance 2.2, SD ~1.483.

Option J: Variance 2.5, SD ~1.581.

Wait, option B and J have variance 2.5, which is close to 2.476. The standard deviation for 2.5 is sqrt(2.5)= approx 1.581, which matches our calculation of ~1.573 (since 2.476's square root is closer to 1.573, but 2.5's square root is 1.581).

But wait, our calculated variance is 2.476, which is very close to 2.5, so perhaps the options rounded it to 2.5.

Looking at the options:

Option B: Range 3, Variance 2.5, SD 1.581.

Option J: Range 5, Variance 2.5, SD 1.581.

Wait, earlier I determined the range is 4 (max 4, min 0). So options with range 4 are C, E, H, I.

So from the options, the correct range is 4.

So looking back, option E has range 4, variance 2, SD 1.414.

Option C: range 4, variance 2.2, SD 1.483.

Option H: range 4, variance 1.5, SD 1.225.

None of these match our calculated variance of ~2.476.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the data as having eight points,
