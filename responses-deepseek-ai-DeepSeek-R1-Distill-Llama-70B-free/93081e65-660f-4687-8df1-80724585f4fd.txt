Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about redshift and quasars. Hmm, I remember that redshift has to do with the Doppler effect when objects are moving away from us in the universe. The problem says that the hydrogen lines in the quasar's spectrum are shifted into the red, meaning the wavelength is longer than what we see in a lab. 

The question states that the wavelengths are three times as long as those in the lab. So if the lab wavelength is λ, the observed wavelength λ_obs is 3λ. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait, no. Oh wait, no. Wait, the observed wavelength is three times as long as the rest wavelength. So λ_obs = 3λ_rest. Or wait, actually, no. Wait, redshift is when the observed wavelength is longer. So yes, if they're shifted into the red, then λ_obs is longer. So yes, if the rest wavelength is λ, then the observed is 3λ. So the redshift z is (λ_obs - λ)/λ. So z = (3λ - λ)/λ = 2. So z=2.

Wait, what's the formula relating redshift to velocity? I think for non-relativistic speeds, the Doppler shift formula is z ≈ v/c. But wait, when z is small, but for larger z, you need the relativistic version. Because when the speed is a significant fraction of c, the approximation z=v/c doesn't hold anymore.

The relativistic Doppler effect formula for a source moving away is λ_obs / λ_rest = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ). Or wait, another version. Oh right, another form is 1 + z = sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ), maybe? Or is it 1 + z = (1 + v/c)/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²))?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The Doppler shift formula in special relativity for light when the source is moving away is given by:

λ_obs / λ_rest = sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) )

So here, λ_obs is 3 times λ_rest, so λ_obs / λ_rest = 3. Therefore,

3 = sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) )

Let me square both sides to get rid of the square root:

9 = (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c)

Now, let's set x = v/c to make it easier.

So 9 = (1 + x)/(1 - x)

Multiply both sides by (1 - x):

9(1 - x) = 1 + x

Expand the left side: 9 - 9x = 1 + x

Bring variables to one side and constants to the other. Let's subtract 1 from both sides:

8 -9x = x

Add 9x to both sides:

8 = 10x

So x = 8/10 = 0.8

So v = 0.8c. Looking at the options, option C is 0.8c. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but wait another thing, what about the approximation when z is large? Oh, but in this case, z is 2, which is a large value, so the relativistic formula is definitely necessary. So yes, the correct approach is the one I took.

Alternatively, maybe I should double-check the formula. Another formula I remember is 1 + z = ( (1 + (v/c) ) / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) ) ) for transverse motion, but wait, no. Wait, no, when the source is moving directly away, the Doppler shift is given by 1 + z = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), which is what I used earlier. So I think I did it right.

Another way to approach this is to set up the equations again. Let me do that step by step.

Given:

λ_obs = 3λ_rest → λ_obs / λ_rest = 3

Using the relativistic Doppler shift formula for recession (source moving away):

λ_obs / λ_rest = sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

So,

sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) = 3

Square both sides:

(1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) = 9

Let x = v/c.

(1 + x)/(1 - x) =9 → 1 +x =9(1 -x) → 1 +x =9 -9x → x +9x =9-1 → 10x=8 → x=0.8 → v=0.8c.

Yep, that's correct. So the answer is C.

The problem involves determining the relative speed of the quasar 3C9 based on the observed redshift of its hydrogen lines. The wavelengths of the hydrogen lines are three times longer than those observed in a laboratory on Earth, indicating significant redshift. The redshift \( z \) is calculated as:

\[
z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}} - \lambda_{\text{rest}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}} = \frac{3\lambda_{\text{rest}} - \lambda_{\text{rest}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}} = 2.
\]

For large redshifts, the relativistic Doppler effect must be used. The relativistic formula relating the observed wavelength to the rest wavelength is:

\[
\frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}.
\]

Substituting \(\frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}} = 3\), we get:

\[
3 = \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
9 = \frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}.
\]

Let \( x = v/c \). Then:

\[
9 = \frac{1 + x}{1 - x}.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
9(1 - x) = 1 + x \quad \Rightarrow \quad 9 - 9x = 1 + x \quad \Rightarrow \quad 8 = 10x \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 0.8.
\]

Thus, \( v = 0.8c \). Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C: 0.8c**
