Okay, so I have this problem about Mr. Wingate's automobile insurance. I need to figure out how much his refund would be in two scenarios: if he cancels the policy and if the insurance company cancels it. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, the insurance costs $173.50 per year. His policy was cancelled after 115 days. So, the refund should be based on the time he used the insurance and the time remaining. I think the approach here is to calculate the pro-rata refund, which is proportional to the time elapsed.

Wait, but wait—there's a catch here. I remember that when a policy is cancelled, sometimes the insurance company calculates the refund differently depending on who cancels. Like, if the customer cancels, maybe they charge a fee or a certain percentage, but if the company cancels, perhaps they give a full pro-rata refund.

So, let's think about the scenarios:

(a) If Mr. Wingate cancels the policy. I think in this case, he might not get a full refund for the unused days. Maybe the company keeps a portion. Alternatively, perhaps he gets a refund minus some administrative fee. But I'm not exactly sure about the specifics here.

(b) If the insurance company cancels the policy. In this situation, I would expect the refund to be based on the exact time left on the policy. So, it's a full pro-rata calculation without any additional fees.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Another angle: maybe when the policyholder cancels, the refund is calculated as the total minus the minimum premium, which is a fixed amount. But I don't know the minimum premium here because it's not provided in the question. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps the question assumes a simple pro-rata calculation in both cases, but maybe the way the refund is calculated is different. Alternatively, perhaps the insurance company uses a different method, like short-rate cancellation for policyholder cancellals and pro-rata for company cancellals.

Oh right! I think in insurance, when the policyholder cancels, the refund is calculated on a short-rate basis, which includes a penalty or a higher charge for the time covered, whereas when the company cancels, it's pro-rata, without such a penalty.

So, for a short-rate cancellation, the formula is: the total premium multiplied by the ratio of the time the policy was in force plus a penalty, perhaps. Or wait, maybe it's the earned premium plus a fee.

Alternatively, I think the short-rate formula is: the refund equals the premium multiplied by (1 - (time in force / total policy period) - a short rate factor, like 10% of the unearned premium or something. But I'm not exactly sure about the exact calculation here.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the standard approach. Oh wait, this is a thought process, so I have to think as if I'm trying to solve it without external resources.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days in a year. Typically, 365 days.

2. The policy was in effect for 115 days.

3. The premium is $173.50 per year.

So, for a pro-rata calculation, the refund would be the unearned portion. That is, the company has earned part of the premium for the days covered, and the refund is the remaining.

So, earned premium = (115/365) * 173.50

Unearned premium (refund) would be 173.50 - earned premium.

Calculating that:

115/365 = approx 0.31507

0.31507 * 173.50 ≈ 54.66

So earned premium ≈ $54.66. Therefore, the unearned is 173.50 - 54.66 = $118.84.

Wait, but that's if the company cancels, perhaps. So, in case (b), the refund is $118.84.

In case (a), where the policyholder cancels, perhaps a short-rate calculation applies. Short rate would mean that the unearned premium is less than pro-rata. Because the company would deduct a higher amount for the time covered.

How do you calculate short-rate? I think it's similar but with an additional charge. The formula for short-rate is:

Refund = Unearned premium - Short Rate fee

Alternatively, the short-rate refund is calculated as:

Refund = (Unearned premium) * (1 - (time in force / total period)) - some factor.

Wait, perhaps the short rate formula is: 

Refund = (Total premium) * (1 - (time in force / total period)) - (some percentage of the unearned premium, like 10% or a flat fee).

Wait, perhaps it's that the earned premium is calculated as the pro-rata amount plus a penalty. So, the company keeps a higher portion.

Alternatively, I've heard that for short-rate cancellations, the refund is 90% of the unearned premium. Or is it 90% of the pro-rata unearned?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Maybe the short-rate formula is:

Refund = (Unearned premium) * (1 - (time in force / policy period)) 

Wait, that doesn't make sense because that would just be the unearned premium squared, which isn't right.

Alternatively, the short-rate formula might include a minimum earned premium, such as the greater of the pro-rata earned premium or a certain percentage, like 20% of the total premium. But without knowing the exact terms here, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that when the policyholder cancels, the company calculates the refund as the pro-rata earned, but when the company cancels, they might use a different method, perhaps a more favorable one for the policyholder.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises from whether the refund is based on pro-rata or short-rate. Let me try to get this straight.

Pro-rata cancellation means the refund is based purely on the time remaining. So, if you've used 115 days, you get back the proportion of the premium that's left.

Short-rate cancellation would mean that you get less than the pro-rata amount because the company charges a higher rate for the time you were covered. So, the refund is less than the pro-rata.

Wait, no, wait. Short-rate is when the policy is cancelled before the term, and the refund is less than pro-rata. So, the company keeps a larger portion of the premium.

So, in case (a), if Mr. Wingate cancels, the refund is calculated on a short-rate basis. In case (b), the company cancels, so it's pro-rata.

So, let's compute both.

First, the pro-rata refund for case (b):

Pro-rata unearned premium: 173.50 * (365 -115)/365 = 173.50 * 250/365 = 173.50 * (approx 0.68493) ≈ 173.50 * 0.68493.

Wait, wait, no, that's the unearned. Alternatively, the unearned portion is 173.50 * (250/365) ≈ 173.50 * 0.68493 ≈ let's calculate that.

173.50 * 0.68493: Let's compute 173.50 * 0.6 = 104.10, 0.08 *173.50=13.88, 0.00493 *173.50≈0.855. So adding: 104.10 +13.88=117.98 +0.855≈118.83. So about $118.84.

So for case (b), the refund is $118.84.

For case (a), it's a short-rate cancellation, so the refund is less. How much less?

I think the short-rate formula can vary, but one common approach is that the earned premium is the pro-rata amount plus a flat fee, or a percentage of the unearned premium is deducted.

Alternatively, the short-rate refund is calculated as follows:

Refund = (Total premium) * ( (Total days - days in force) / Total days ) - ( some fee )

But I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, the short-rate calculation uses a table or a specific formula, but without that, perhaps we can assume a standard approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the short-rate is calculated using the formula:

Refund = (Total premium) * (1 - (days in force / total days)) - (some percentage, say 10%, of the refund)

So, in this case, the pro-rata unearned is 173.50 * (250/365) ≈ 118.84. Then, a 10% fee would be 11.88. So refund would be 118.84 - 11.88 = 106.96. But that doesn't match any of the options, so perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe the short-rate refund is 90% of the pro-rata unearned. So 0.9 * 118.84 ≈ 107.  But again, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the short-rate is calculated as: the earned premium is the pro-rata earned plus a minimum of 20% of the total premium. So, earned = max(pro-rata earned, 0.2 * total premium).

Let's calculate pro-rata earned: 173.50 * (115/365) ≈54.66.

20% of 173.50 is 34.70. Since 54.66 is more than 34.70, the earned premium remains 54.66. So the unearned is still 118.84, same as pro-rata. Hmm, that can't be right because then case (a) and (b) would have the same refund, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the short-rate is the greater of the pro-rata earned or a certain percentage. So, perhaps the company earns the pro-rata amount or a certain percentage, whichever is higher. But in this case, it's the same as pro-rata, which doesn't change the refund. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, the short-rate is calculated by adding a fixed fee to the pro-rata earned. For example, the company might charge a $25 fee for cancellation.

So in that case, the earned premium would be 54.66 +25=79.66, making the refund 173.50 -79.66=93.84. But that's not matching any options either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options provided.

The options are:

A: $173.50 and $173.50

B: $42 and $115

C: $72.87 and $54.66

D: $100.63 and $118.84

Wait, so for case (a) and (b), the options have different first and second values.

From my earlier calculation, case (b) is $118.84, which matches option D's second value. So case (b) is $118.84.

Now, I need to find what case (a) would be.

Looking at the options, option D says (a) is $100.63 and (b) is $118.84. So perhaps that's the correct answer.

So how is $100.63 calculated for case (a)?

Let me think. Maybe the short-rate formula is used. Let's see.

Alternative approach: Maybe the policy is subject to a minimum earned premium, such as the first month's premium is fully earned, and the rest is pro-rated.

Wait, perhaps the first X days are considered fully earned. But without knowing X, it's hard to compute. Alternatively, maybe the company charges a flat fee for cancellation.

Another approach: perhaps the refund is calculated based on a 30-day month. So, 115 days is approx 3.83 months. They might calculate it as 4 months' premium earned, and refund the remaining 8 months.

Wait, 173.50 per year. So monthly premium would be 173.50 /12 ≈14.458 per month.

If 4 months are earned, that's 4 *14.458 ≈57.83.

So the refund would be 173.50 -57.83 = 115.67. But that's close to option B's 115, but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps they calculate it as 3 full months plus 15 days of the fourth month. So 3 months + half a month.

So 3.5 months. 3.5 *14.458 ≈50.60. Then refund is 173.50 -50.60 ≈122.90, which doesn't match any option.

Hmm, perhaps I'm not on the right track.

Wait, another approach: maybe the refund is calculated using exact days but with a different method for each case.

Wait, perhaps the company uses a daily rate. Let's compute the daily rate.

173.50 per year: 173.50 /365 ≈0.4753 per day.

So, for 115 days, the earned premium is 115 *0.4753 ≈54.66.

So, the unearned is 173.50 -54.66 =118.84, which is the pro-rata refund.

If the policyholder cancels, maybe the company deducts an additional fee. For example, a 10% penalty on the unearned amount.

So, 10% of 118.84 is 11.88. So, refund would be 118.84 -11.88 =106.96. But that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the company charges a flat fee of, say, $25, so 118.84 -25=93.84, which also doesn't match.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D has (a) as $100.63 and (b) as $118.84. So if (b) is the pro-rata, then (a) would be the short-rate, which is lower than pro-rata.

Wait, perhaps the short-rate is calculated as 173.50 * (115/365) + a fee. No, that would be higher than the pro-rata.

Wait, perhaps the short-rate is calculated as the minimum between the pro-rata and a certain percentage. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the company calculates the short-rate as follows: for each month, a certain amount is charged, and any partial month is considered a full month.

So, 115 days is approximately 3 months and 25 days. So 4 months. So 4 months' premium.

At 173.50 per year, each month is 173.50/12 ≈14.458. So 4 months would be 4 *14.458 ≈57.83. So the earned premium is 57.83, and the refund is 173.50 -57.83 ≈115.67, which is close to option B's $115 for case (a).

But option D's case (a) is $100.63, which is lower. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the company uses a different method. Maybe for the first month, they charge the full month, and the rest are pro-rated.

So, for 115 days: the first 30 days are charged as a full month. The remaining 85 days are at the daily rate.

So, first month: 173.50/12 ≈14.458.

Remaining 85 days: 85 * (173.50/365) ≈85 *0.4753 ≈40.50.

Total earned: 14.458 +40.50 ≈54.958, which is about the same as the pro-rata earned of 54.66. So the refund would be 173.50 -54.958≈118.54, which is the same as case (b). So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the company uses a different approach. Maybe for the policyholder cancellation, the refund is based on the daily rate, but the company keeps the entire premium for the first month. So, if the policy was cancelled after 115 days, which is more than a month, perhaps they charge for the first month and then pro-rate the rest.

Wait, let me compute that.

First month: 30 days. Charge: 173.50/12 ≈14.458.

Days beyond first month: 115 -30 =85 days.

85 days * (173.50/365) ≈85 *0.4753≈40.50.

Total earned:14.458 +40.50≈54.958.

So, refund is 173.50 -54.958≈118.54, same as before.

Wait, but that's same as the pro-rata, which doesn't help.

Maybe the company charges for the entire first month, plus any additional full months, and partial months are charged as full months. So, 115 days is 3 full months (3*30=90 days) plus 25 days. So, 4 months total.

So, 4 months *14.458≈57.83 earned. So refund is 173.50-57.83≈115.67, which would be around $115.67, close to option B's $115.

But option D's case (a) is $100.63. So how?

Wait, perhaps the company charges the full premium if the policy is cancelled within a certain period, like the first 60 days. But 115 days is beyond that, so maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the short-rate formula is:

Refund = (Total premium) * (1 - (days in force / policy period)) - (Short rate factor * Unearned premium)

Where the short rate factor is a percentage, say 10%.

So, Unearned premium is 173.50*(250/365)=118.84.

Short rate factor is 10%, so 0.1*118.84=11.88.

Refund = 118.84 -11.88=106.96.

But that's not matching any option either.

Wait, another approach: I've heard that short rate is calculated using a specific formula, like:

Refund = (Total premium) * ( (Total days - days in force) / Total days ) - ( (Total premium) * ( (days in force / Total days) ) * (some percentage) )

Wait, that seems too convoluted.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the options. Since option D has (b) as $118.84, which matches the pro-rata, and (a) as $100.63, perhaps I should calculate what $100.63 would represent.

Let me compute what percentage of the total premium 100.63 is:

100.63 /173.50 ≈0.580, or 58% of the total.

Alternatively, 173.50 -100.63=72.87, which is the earned premium.

So, 72.87 is the earned, which is 72.87 /173.50 ≈0.42, or 42% of the total premium.

So, 42% earned in 115 days.

How does that relate to the days?

115 days is 115/365 ≈0.
