Question:

A 32-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after being struck by a car while driving his motorcycle. He reports severe pelvic pain. On examination, there is bruising of the perineum and pain is elicited with motion of his pelvis. Blood is noted at the urethral meatus. There is no other penile trauma. A plain x-ray shows a fracture of the superior pubic ramus and retrograde urethrography is done to evaluate for a urethral disruption. Which of the following portions of the urethra would be at greatest risk for injury in this patient?

Options:

A: Spongy
B: Posterior
C: Intramural (pre-prostatic)
D: Prostatic
E: Proximal
F: Penile
G: Bulbous
H: Anterior
I: Membranous
J: Distal

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about a patient with a urethral injury after a pelvic fracture. Let me think through this step by step.

The patient is a 32-year-old man who was in a motorcycle accident and hit by a car. He has severe pelvic pain, perineal bruising, and pain when moving his pelvis. There's blood at the urethral meatus, which I remember is a sign of possible urethral injury. They did a plain x-ray showing a superior pubic ramus fracture, and a retrograde urethrography is being done to check for urethral disruption.

The question is asking which part of the urethra is at the greatest risk for injury here. The options are various portions of the urethra.

I remember that the urethra is divided into different parts. In males, the urethra is longer than in females. Let me list them out as I recall:

1. Prostatic urethra: This part passes through the prostate gland.
2. Membranous urethra: This is the shortest part, surrounded by the urethral sphincter. It's the part that's just after the prostatic urethra and before the penile urethra. I think this is the part that's located in the deep perineal pouch, so it's more fixed and susceptible to injury.
3. Bulbous urethra: This is the beginning of the spongy (penile) urethra, located in the bulb of the penis.
4. Penile or spongy urethra: Runs along the length of the penis, surrounded by the corpus spongiosum.

In the context of pelvic fractures, especially from something like a motorcycle accident where there's a lot of force to the pelvis, the urethra can get injured. I remember that the most common type of urethral injury in such cases is a disruption of the membranous urethra. Why? Because the membranous part is fixed in place by the pelvic muscles and bones. So when the pelvis fractures, especially if it's a high-energy trauma like a car accident, the movement can cause shearing forces that tear this fixed portion.

In this case, the patient has a fracture of the superior pubic ramus. The pubic rami are part of the pelvis, and a fracture there can lead to displacement of the pelvic bones. The urethra, particularly the membranous part, can be stretched or torn because it's anchored in the pelvic floor. The blood at the meatus is a classic sign of urethral injury, so they're doing the retrograde urethrography to confirm.

Looking at the options, the question is about which portion is at greatest risk. The options are:

A: Spongy — that's the penile part, which is more flexible and less likely to be injured in pelvic fractures.

B: Posterior — I'm not sure about this one. Wait, sometimes the posterior urethra refers to prostatic and membranous parts. But the posterior urethra might be a term used in a different classification.

C: Intramural (pre-prostatic) — I think this is the part that's within the wall of the bladder and prostate, maybe not as susceptible to injury in this scenario.

D: Prostatic — that's the part inside the prostate, which is less likely to be injured in a pelvic fracture compared to the membranous part.

E: Proximal — that's a general term, could refer to the beginning part. Maybe prostatic or membranous.

F: Penile — same as spongy, not likely in this case.

G: Bulbous — part of the spongy urethra, so again, not the most at risk.

H: Anterior — the anterior urethra is the spongy part in the penis, which is more mobile and less likely to be injured in pelvic injury.

I: Membranous — this is the one I was thinking earlier. It's the part that's fixed and more prone to injury in pelvic fractures.

J: Distal — that would be further along the penile urethra, not the part near the pelvis.

So putting it all together, the injury is most likely to the membranous urethra. So the answer should be option I.

The patient is a 32-year-old man involved in a motorcycle accident with a pelvic fracture, perineal bruising, and blood at the urethral meatus, indicating potential urethral injury. Pelvic fractures, especially from high-energy trauma, often result in urethral injuries due to shearing forces. The membranous urethra, which is fixed in the pelvic floor, is most susceptible to injury in such cases. This is because it is anchored by the pelvic bones and muscles, making it prone to disruption during pelvic fractures. The blood at the meatus and the imaging findings further support this likelihood. Other parts of the urethra, such as the prostatic, spongy, or penile urethra, are less likely to be injured in this scenario due to their greater mobility or different anatomical locations.

The correct answer is **I: Membranous**.
