Okay, so I've got this problem here about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says: The radioactive decay constant for radium is 1.36 × 10^-11. How many disintegrations per second occur in 100 g of radium? The molecular weight is given as 226 g/mole. And there are multiple-choice options to choose from.

Hmm, right. I remember that the decay constant lambda (λ) is related to the half-life, but more importantly, the number of disintegrations per second is given by the formula N times lambda, where N is the number of atoms present.

So the formula I think I need is: Activity (A) = λ * N.

But wait, how do I find N, the number of atoms in 100 grams of radium?

Oh right, N can be calculated using Avogadro's number. So N equals the number of moles multiplied by Avogadro's number.

Number of moles (n) is mass (m) divided by molecular weight (M). So n = m/M.

Putting it all together, N = (m/M) * Avogadro's number.

Avogadro's number is 6.022e23 per mole, I think.

Let me jot down the numbers I have:

Mass (m) = 100 grams.

Molecular weight (M) = 226 g/mol.

Lambda (λ) = 1.36e-11 s^-1.

So first step, calculate the number of moles.

n = 100 g / 226 g/mol ≈ 0.4422 mol.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 100 divided by 226. Let me think, 226 is about 2.26e2. 100 / 226 is approximately 0.4422 moles. Yeah, that's correct.

Then, the number of atoms N is n multiplied by Avogadro's number.

N = 0.4422 mol * 6.022e23 atoms/mol.

Calculating that: 0.4422 * 6.022e23.

Let me compute 0.4422 * 6.022 first. 0.4 *6 is 2.4, 0.04 *6 is 0.24, 0.0022*6≈0.0132. So total is about 2.4+0.24=2.64, plus 0.0132 is 2.6532. But wait, that's 0.4422 *6.022 without considering the exponents.

Wait, no, 0.4422 *6.022 = let me compute it more accurately.

6.022 * 0.4 is 2.4088. 6.022 *0.04 is 0.24088. 6.022 *0.002 is 0.012044. 6.022 *0.0002 is 0.0012044. Adding all together: 2.4088 +0.24088=2.64968; plus 0.012044 is 2.661724; plus 0.0012044 is approximately 2.6629284.

So about 2.663 when I multiply 0.4422 by 6.022. So N≈2.663e23 atoms.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because 0.4422 * 6.022e23 is 0.4422 *6.022 = approx 2.662e23? Wait, no. Wait, 0.4422 * 6.022e23 would be (0.4422 * 6.022) × 1e23. Hmm, 0.4422 *6.022 is approx 2.662, so N is 2.662e23 atoms.

Wait, but wait: 0.4422 *6.022e23 = (0.4422 *6.022) × 1e23. Let me calculate 0.4422 *6.022.

6.022 *0.4 is 2.4088.

6.022 *0.04 is 0.24088.

6.022 *0.002 is 0.012044.

6.022 *0.0002 is 0.0012044.

Adding these up: 2.4088 + 0.24088 is 2.64968; +0.012044 is 2.661724; +0.0012044 is 2.6629284. So approximately 2.6629284.

So N ≈ 2.6629 × 1e23 atoms.

Wait, no, wait. Because 0.4422 is in moles, and Avogadro's number is 6.022e23 per mole. So 0.4422 *6.022e23 = (0.4422 *6.022) × 1e23. Oh wait, 0.4422 *6.022 is about 2.6629, so N ≈ 2.6629e23 atoms.

Now, the activity A is lambda multiplied by N.

Lambda is 1.36e-11 s^-1.

So A = λ * N = (1.36e-11) * (2.6629e23).

Multiplying these together: 1.36 *2.6629 is approximately let's see.

1.36 *2 =2.72, 1.36 *0.6629 ≈ 0.901.

So total is about 2.72 + 0.901 = 3.621.

Wait wait, more accurately:

1.36 * 2.6629.

Breaking it down:

2 *1.36 = 2.72.

0.6629 *1.36.

Wait, 0.6 *1.36= 0.816, 0.06 *1.36= 0.0816, 0.0029 *1.36≈0.003944.

Adding those: 0.816 +0.0816=0.8976 +0.003944≈0.901544.

So total is 2.72 +0.901544 = 3.621544.

So 3.621544e( -11 +23 ) = 3.621544e12 disintegrations per second.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option J: 3.62 ×10^12 dis/sec. That's very close to my calculation.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps because I might have made a mistake in the calculations.

Alternative approach: Let me compute everything more accurately step by step.

Number of moles n = 100g / 226 g/mol.

n = 100 / 226 = approximately 0.442237 moles.

Number of atoms N = n * Avogadro = 0.442237 * 6.022e23.

Calculating 0.442237 *6.022:

0.442237 *6 = 2.653422.

0.442237 *0.022 = approx 0.00971.

So total is about 2.66313.

So N = 2.66313e23 atoms.

Now, A = λ * N.

λ is 1.36e-11.

So 1.36e-11 * 2.66313e23.

Multiply the coefficients: 1.36 * 2.66313.

Let me compute that accurately.

1.36 *2 = 2.72.

1.36 *0.66313.

Hmm, 0.6 *1.36 = 0.816.

0.06313 *1.36 = let's compute 0.06 *1.36 = 0.0816; 0.00313 *1.36≈0.00426.

So 0.816 + 0.0816 = 0.8976 + 0.00426≈0.90186.

So total is 2.72 + 0.90186 = 3.62186.

So A ≈3.62186e12 dis/sec.

Looking at the options, option J is 3.62 ×10^12, which matches.

But let me check the options again. Option J is 3.62e12, which is our result.

But another thing I should check: the formula. Wait, I used A = λN, which is correct. Yes, because activity is the product of decay constant and number of atoms.

Wait, another point: the decay constant is per second, and the number of atoms is correct.

So the correct answer should be option J, 3.62e12 dis/sec.

To determine the number of disintegrations per second in 100 g of radium, we use the formula for radioactive activity:

\[
A = \lambda \cdot N
\]

where:
- \( \lambda \) is the decay constant (\( 1.36 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{s}^{-1} \)),
- \( N \) is the number of atoms of radium.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of moles of radium
The number of moles (\( n \)) is given by:

\[
n = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{molecular weight}} = \frac{100 \, \text{g}}{226 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.4422 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of atoms
The number of atoms (\( N \)) is calculated using Avogadro's number (\( 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{atoms/mol} \)):

\[
N = n \cdot 6.022 \times 10^{23} = 0.4422 \cdot 6.022 \times 10^{23} \approx 2.663 \times 10^{23} \, \text{atoms}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the activity
Substitute \( \lambda \) and \( N \) into the activity formula:

\[
A = \lambda \cdot N = (1.36 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot (2.663 \times 10^{23}).
\]

First, multiply the coefficients:

\[
1.36 \cdot 2.663 \approx 3.621.
\]

Then, add the exponents:

\[
10^{-11} \cdot 10^{23} = 10^{12}.
\]

Thus:

\[
A \approx 3.621 \times 10^{12} \, \text{disintegrations/second}.
\]

### Final Answer
The closest option to the calculated value is **J: \( 3.62 \times 10^{12} \, \text{dis/sec} \)**.
