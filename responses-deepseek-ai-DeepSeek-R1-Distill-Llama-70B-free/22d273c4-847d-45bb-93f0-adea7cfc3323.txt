Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about the TV series 'Bonanza'. The question is asking which of the options was not one of the Cartwright sons. The options are A: Little Joe, B: Adam, C: Hoss, and D: Ben.

Hmm, I'm trying to remember the show. I think 'Bonanza' was a western series that revolved around the Cartwright family. They had a ranch called the Ponderosa, right? The family consisted of a father and his three sons, each with different mothers since the mom had died.

Wait, the sons were each named differently. Let me think. There was Adam, Hoss, and Little Joe. Oh, right! Ben was the father, not one of the sons. So the sons were Adam, Hoss, and Little Joe. So the question is asking who was not one of the sons, which would be Ben.

Let me double-check. The main characters were Ben Cartwright, the patriarch, and his three sons: Adam, the eldest, who was smart and maybe a bit more serious; Hoss, the big, gentle one; and Little Joe, the youngest and more of a hothead or the adventurous type. So D is Ben, the father, not a son. So the answer should be D.
