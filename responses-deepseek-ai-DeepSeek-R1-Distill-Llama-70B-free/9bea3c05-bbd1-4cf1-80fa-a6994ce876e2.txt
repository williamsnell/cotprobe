Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Boyle temperature of a van der Waals gas. Hmm, I remember that the Boyle temperature is the temperature at which a real gas behaves like an ideal gas over a considerable range of pressures. But wait, how exactly is it calculated for a van der Waals gas?

The van der Waals equation is (P + a(n/V)^2)(V/n - b) = RT. Right, where a and b are the constants, and R is the gas constant. So I'm looking for an expression that gives the Boyle temperature T_B in terms of a, b, and R.

I think the Boyle temperature is derived from considering the second virial coefficient. Oh right, because at the Boyle temperature, the second virial coefficient B is zero. So, B = 0 at T = T_B.

The second virial coefficient for a van der Waals gas is given by B = b - (a/(RT)). So setting B to zero would give the condition for the Boyle temperature.

Let me write that out: 0 = b - a/(R T_B). Solving for T_B, I can rearrange this equation. 

Starting with:
b = a/(R T_B)

To solve for T_B, I can multiply both sides by R T_B:
b R T_B = a

Then, divide both sides by (b R):
T_B = a/(b R)

Wait, that leaves me with T_B equals a divided by (b times R). So looking at the options, which one matches that?

Looking through the options:
Option G is a/(b R), which is what I have. Any other options?

Wait, let me double-check. Did I mix up any terms? Let me go through the steps again. The second virial coefficient B is b - (a/(RT)). Setting B=0 gives b = a/(R T_B). Then T_B = a/(b R). Yeah, that seems right.

So the correct answer should be option G. Let me check the options again:

Option G: T_B = a/(b R). Yep, that's what I derived.

The Boyle temperature \( T_B \) is the temperature at which a real gas behaves like an ideal gas over a considerable range of pressures. For a van der Waals gas, the second virial coefficient \( B \) is given by:

\[
B = b - \frac{a}{RT}.
\]

At the Boyle temperature, \( B = 0 \), so:

\[
0 = b - \frac{a}{RT_B}.
\]

Rearranging to solve for \( T_B \):

\[
b = \frac{a}{RT_B}.
\]

Multiplying through by \( RT_B \) and dividing by \( bR \):

\[
T_B = \frac{a}{bR}.
\]

Thus, the Boyle temperature \( T_B \) is expressed as \( T_B = \frac{a}{bR} \). Comparing this result with the given options, the correct choice is:

**G: \( T_B = \frac{a}{bR} \).**
