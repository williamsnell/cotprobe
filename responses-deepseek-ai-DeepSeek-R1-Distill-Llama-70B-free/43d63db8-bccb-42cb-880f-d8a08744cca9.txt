Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a particle in a one-dimensional box. Hmm, I remember that when particles transition between energy levels, they emit or absorb photons. The problem says that the particle goes from n=5 to n=2 and emits a photon with a specific frequency. I need to find the length of the box.

Wait, right, the energy levels in a particle in a box are quantized. The formula for the energy levels is E_n = (n² h²) / (8 m L²), where h is Planck's constant, m is the mass, L is the length of the box, and n is the principal quantum number.

So the photon's energy is the difference between E5 and E2. The energy of the photon is given by E_photon = h f, where f is frequency. So E_photon = E5 - E2.

Let me write that out. E_photon = (h²/(8mL²))(5² - 2²). Because E5 is when n=5, E2 when n=2.

So plugging in the numbers, 5 squared is 25, 2 squared is 4. So 25 minus 4 is 21. So E_photon = (21 h²) / (8 m L²).

Wait, but E_photon is also h times frequency f. So h f equals (21 h²)/(8 m L²). Hmm, I can cancel h from both sides. So f = (21 h) / (8 m L²).

Rearranging for L², I get L² = (21 h) / (8 m f). Then take the square root to find L.

Wait, let's plug in the numbers. Let me get all the constants correct. The mass given is 9.1e-28 grams. Oh wait, I should convert that to kilograms because Planck's constant is in J·s (kg·m²/s). So 1 g is 0.001 kg. So 9.1e-28 g is 9.1e-31 kg.

Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. The frequency f is 6.0e14 s^-1.

Putting it all together:

L² = (21 * h) / (8 * m * f)

Wait, let me compute the numerator and denominator step by step.

Numerator: 21 * h = 21 * 6.626e-34 = Let me calculate that. 6.626e-34 * 21 = 

6.626 * 20 is 132.52, plus 6.626 is 139.146. So 139.146e-34. So 1.39146e-32.

Denominator: 8 * m * f = 8 * 9.1e-31 kg * 6.0e14 s^-1.

First compute 9.1e-31 *6e14 = 9.1 *6 =54.6; exponents 1e-31 *1e14=1e-17. So 54.6e-17 = 5.46e-16.

Multiply by 8: 5.46e-16 *8 = 43.68e-16 =4.368e-15.

So L squared is numerator over denominator: (1.39146e-32) / (4.368e-15) = let's compute that.

1.39146e-32 divided by 4.368e-15 equals approximately (1.39146 /4.368) *1e-17.

1.39146 ÷4.368 ≈ 0.3183. So 0.3183e-17 m², which is 3.183e-18 m². So L is the square root of that.

Square root of 3.183e-18 m². Let's compute sqrt(3.183e-18). 

Square root of 3.183 is approx 1.784, and sqrt(1e-18) is 1e-9. So 1.784e-9 meters, which is 1.784 nanometers.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculation steps because I might have messed up exponents somewhere.

Wait, let me recalculate the denominator. 8 * m * f = 8 * 9.1e-31 kg * 6e14 s⁻¹.

9.1e-31 *6e14 = (9.1 *6) *1e-31+14 =54.6 *1e-17 =5.46e-16. Then multiply by 8: 5.46e-16 *8 =4.368e-15. That seems right.

Numerator: 21 *6.626e-34 =21 *6.626e-34 = let me compute 6.626 *21 = 139.146, so 139.146e-34 =1.39146e-32.

So L²= 1.39146e-32 /4.368e-15 = (1.39146/4.368) *1e-17.

1.39146 divided by 4.368: Let me compute that.

Approximately 0.3183. So L²= 0.3183e-17 m² =3.183e-18 m².

So L is sqrt(3.183e-18) = sqrt(3.183) * 1e-9. sqrt(3) is about 1.732, sqrt(3.183) is maybe 1.784.

So 1.784e-9 meters is 1.784 nm. Looking at the options, let's see.

Options are:

A:2.7 nm

B:2.0

C:1.8

D:1.2

E:3.0

F:0.9

G:1.5

H:3.5

I:2.2

J:2.4

So 1.784 is approximately 1.8 nm. So option C is 1.8 nm.

Wait, but I recall that when I calculated, I got 1.784, which is about 1.78, so 1.8. So the answer should be C.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me recheck the steps.

Another approach: Let's compute everything step by step.

Compute the numerator: 21 * h = 21 * 6.626e-34 = 6.626 *21 = let's see.

6 *21=126, 0.626*21=13.146. So 126 +13.146=139.146. So 139.146e-34 = 1.39146e-32 J·m² (since h has units J·s, but when multiplied by 21, which is unitless, it's still J·s, but then in the formula for L², the units will work out because denominator has m*f, which is kg/s, I think. Units aside, let's compute the numbers.)

Denominator: 8 * m * f =8 *9.1e-31 kg *6e14 1/s.

Calculate 8 *9.1e-31 = 72.8e-31 =7.28e-30.

Then multiply by 6e14: 7.28e-30 *6e14 =43.68e-16. Which is 4.368e-15.

So L² =1.39146e-32 /4.368e-15 = (1.39146 /4.368 ) *1e-17.

1.39146 divided by 4.368: let me compute this more accurately.

4.368 * 0.3 = 1.3104. 0.318 *4.368 = ?

Wait, 4.368 *0.318= ?

4 *0.318=1.272.

0.368 *0.318: Let me compute 0.3 *0.368=0.1104, 0.018 *0.368=0.006624. So total 0.1104 +0.006624=0.117024.

So 0.318 *4.368 = 1.272 +0.117024=1.389024. That's very close to 1.39146.

So 0.318 gives 1.389024, which is a little less than 1.39146.

The difference is 1.39146 -1.389024=0.002436.

So 0.002436 /4.368 gives approximately 0.000558. So the actual value is 0.318 + 0.000558=0.318558.

So approximately 0.3186. So L² = 0.3186e-17 m² =3.186e-18 m².

Then L = sqrt(3.186e-18) m.

The square root of 3.186 is about 1.785, and square root of 1e-18 is 1e-9. So L≈1.785e-9 m =1.785 nm, which is approximately 1.8 nm. So option C is correct.

To solve the problem, we use the energy levels of a particle in a one-dimensional box, given by:

\[
E_n = \frac{n^2 h^2}{8 m L^2}
\]

where \( h \) is Planck's constant, \( m \) is the mass of the particle, \( L \) is the length of the box, and \( n \) is the quantum number. The energy difference between the \( n=5 \) and \( n=2 \) levels is emitted as a photon of frequency \( f \), so:

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = E_5 - E_2 = \frac{h^2}{8 m L^2} (5^2 - 2^2) = \frac{21 h^2}{8 m L^2}
\]

The energy of the photon is also related to its frequency by:

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = h f
\]

Equating the two expressions for \( E_{\text{photon}} \):

\[
h f = \frac{21 h^2}{8 m L^2}
\]

Canceling \( h \) from both sides and rearranging for \( L^2 \):

\[
L^2 = \frac{21 h}{8 m f}
\]

Taking the square root to find \( L \):

\[
L = \sqrt{\frac{21 h}{8 m f}}
\]

### Substituting the given values:
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \mathrm{J \cdot s} \)
- \( m = 9.1 \times 10^{-31} \, \mathrm{kg} \)
- \( f = 6.0 \times 10^{14} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1} \)

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
21 h = 21 \times 6.626 \times 10^{-34} = 1.39146 \times 10^{-32} \, \mathrm{J \cdot m^2}
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
8 m f = 8 \times 9.1 \times 10^{-31} \times 6.0 \times 10^{14} = 4.368 \times 10^{-15} \, \mathrm{kg \cdot m^2 / s}
\]

Now, compute \( L^2 \):

\[
L^2 = \frac{1.39146 \times 10^{-32}}{4.368 \times 10^{-15}} = 0.3183 \times 10^{-17} \, \mathrm{m^2}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
L = \sqrt{0.3183 \times 10^{-17}} = \sqrt{3.183 \times 10^{-18}} \, \mathrm{m}
\]

\[
L \approx 1.784 \times 10^{-9} \, \mathrm{m} = 1.784 \, \mathrm{nm}
\]

### Final Answer:
The length of the box is approximately \( 1.8 \, \mathrm{nm} \), which corresponds to **option C**.
