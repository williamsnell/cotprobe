Okay, so I've got this biology question here about maintaining constant body temperature. Hmm, I remember from my classes that this has to do with how animals regulate their body heat. Let me think through this.

The question is asking which of the given animals can maintain a constant body temperature regardless of the environment. The options are frog, robin, fish, dog, or lizard.

Wait, I think this relates to whether the animals are endothermic or ectothermic. Endothermic means they produce their own heat, right? So their body temperature stays pretty constant. Ectothermic animals rely on external sources, like the sun, so their body temperature changes with the environment.

Let me list out each animal:

- Frog: I believe they're ectothermic. They're amphibians, so they probably absorb heat from their surroundings.
- Robin: A bird, and birds are endothermic. They generate their own heat, so their body temperature stays constant.
- Fish: They live in water and are ectothermic, so their temp varies with the environment.
- Dog: Mammals are endothermic, so dogs keep a constant temperature.
- Lizard: Reptiles are ectothermic, so they bask in the sun to get heat.

So the question is which ones maintain constant body temp. That would be the endothermic ones. From the list, robin and dog are endothermic.

Looking at the options, the correct pair should be B: robin and dog. Let me check the options again.

Option B says robin, dog. That matches what I thought. So the answer should be B.

The question asks which animals maintain a constant body temperature despite changes in environmental temperature. This depends on whether the animals are endothermic (producing their own heat) or ectothermic (relying on external heat sources).

- **Frog**: Ectothermic (amphibian).
- **Robin**: Endothermic (bird).
- **Fish**: Ectothermic (aquatic animal).
- **Dog**: Endothermic (mammal).
- **Lizard**: Ectothermic (reptile).

Only the robin and dog, being endothermic, maintain a constant body temperature. Among the options, the correct choice is:

**B: robin, dog**

Answer: B
