Okay, so I've got this question here about the influence of genetics on longevity. Hmm, I remember that longevity refers to how long someone lives, right? And the question is asking about the estimated percentage that genetics contribute to that.

Wait, I think I've heard something about twin studies in this context. Twin studies often look at the role of genetics versus environment. So, if identical twins have a higher similarity in lifespan than fraternal twins, that would suggest a genetic component.

From what I recall, the heritability of lifespan is around 20-30%. I think some studies have shown that genetics account for about 20-30% of the variation in human lifespan. So, looking at the options, option D is 20% and option A is 33%. 

But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Some sources might say it's a bit higher. I remember reading that while genetics do play a role, it's not the only factor. Lifestyle, environment, accidents, and other factors are also significant. So the genetic influence isn't the majority, which would make sense why it's around a third or so.

Let me think again. If the options are A:33%, D:20%, then which one is more accurate? I think the common figure I've come across is about 25%, which is between 20 and 33. But since the question asks for an estimate, maybe 20% is on the lower end, and 33% is a bit higher. 

Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing it with other traits. For example, height has a heritability of around 80-90%, which is much higher. So for longevity, it's lower. 

Wait, another thought: I've heard that after a certain age, like around 70 or so, the impact of genetics increases because most people have avoided the major environmental causes of death. So maybe the heritability estimates vary based on the age group studied.

But the question is general, so I think the commonly cited estimate is about 20-30%. So between the options given, 20% is D, 33% is A. I'm a bit torn because I remember seeing 20-something percent as the figure. But sometimes it's presented as roughly a third.

Wait, I think the answer might be around 20-25%, so 20% is an option. Alternatively, some sources might round it up to 25-30%, which would be closer to 33%. 

I'm a bit confused, but I think the more commonly accepted figure is that genetics account for about 20-30% of the variation in longevity. So looking at the options, D is 20%, which is at the lower end, and A is 33%, which is the higher end.

Alternatively, I might be mixing this up with other traits. For instance, I'm pretty sure that the heritability of intelligence is around 50-80%, so that's not relevant here. 

Wait, another angle: I remember a study that said if you live past 65 or so, genetics play a bigger role. But the overall heritability across all ages might be lower. So maybe the 20% figure is more accurate for the general population.

I think I'll go with D:20% as the correct answer because that's the lower end of the estimate I remember. But I'm not 100% certain. Another possibility is that the figure is around 25%, which isn't an option here. Since 20 is an option, that might be the intended answer.

The influence of genetics on longevity is estimated to be around 20-30%. Among the given options, 20% (D) aligns with the lower end of this range, which is a commonly cited figure in studies examining the genetic contribution to lifespan.

Answer: D
