Question:

A resident lived in a house across the street from a small office building. One of the offices in that building was that of a criminal defense lawyer. The resident hated the idea of the lawyer's office being close to her home. She felt that it meant dangerous criminals were coming and going in her neighborhood. The resident spent a lot of time looking out her window, trying to figure out which people going in and out of the office building were criminals, and imagining what sorts of crimes they had committed. The resident eventually decided that she needed to drive the lawyer out of the neighborhood. She made a telephone call to the lawyer and said, "You are scum, and so are all of your clients. I know that you're conspiring to commit crimes with all those bad people you represent. The police should arrest you and put you in jail with your clients. " The lawyer was very upset by what he heard. If the lawyer asserts a claim for defamation against the resident based on the telephone call, he will most likely

Options:

A: succeed, because the resident's remarks were offensive and damaging to the lawyer's reputation.
B: succeed, because the lawyer found the remarks to be upsetting.
C: not succeed, because the resident's remarks were a matter of personal opinion rather than statements of fact.

F: succeed, because the resident's remarks constituted slander per Se.
G: not succeed, because the resident's remarks were made in a personal conversation, not in a public setting.
H: succeed, because the resident's remarks caused emotional distress to the lawyer.
I: not succeed, because the resident's remarks were not published or communicated to anyone but the plaintiff.

Okay, so I've got this question about defamation, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read through it carefully.

The scenario is about a resident living across the street from an office building where a criminal defense lawyer works. The resident doesn't like the idea of the lawyer's office being nearby because she thinks it means dangerous criminals are around. She spends time watching people enter and exit the building, trying to guess which ones are criminals and what crimes they've committed. Eventually, she decides to drive the lawyer out of the neighborhood. She calls the lawyer and says some pretty harsh things: "You are scum, and so are all of your clients. I know that you're conspiring to commit crimes with all those bad people you represent. The police should arrest you and put you in jail with your clients." The lawyer is upset and wants to sue for defamation.

The question is whether the lawyer will succeed in his defamation claim against the resident based on that phone call.

I remember that defamation involves a false statement of fact that harms someone's reputation. There are two types: slander and libel. Slander is spoken, and libel is written. For slander, usually, the statement has to cause actual harm, unless it's slander per se, which involves certain categories that are so obviously harmful that harm is presumed.

Let me think about the elements of defamation. The statement must be false, it must be a statement of fact (not opinion), it must be published or communicated to a third party, and it must cause harm to the plaintiff's reputation.

Looking at the resident's statements: She called the lawyer scum, said his clients are scum, accused him of conspiring to commit crimes, and said the police should arrest him. So, are these statements factual or opinion?

Well, calling someone scum is likely an opinion because it's a subjective judgment. But accusing someone of conspiring to commit crimes sounds more like a statement of fact. However, the resident's statement could be considered as her belief or opinion based on her observations, not necessarily a provable fact.

Wait, but in defamation, the key is whether a reasonable person would interpret the statement as a factual assertion or just an opinion. If it's opinion, it's protected by the First Amendment, right? So, the First Amendment protects statements of opinion, especially in cases involving public figures, but I don't think the lawyer here is a public figure. But the distinction between fact and opinion is crucial.

In this case, the resident said, "I know that you're conspiring to commit crimes with all those bad people you represent." The phrase "I know that" might make it sound like she's asserting a fact. But if she has no evidence and it's just her belief, it's more of an opinion. Alternatively, it could be seen as an allegation of criminal conduct, which is a factual statement.

But wait, the context is a personal call where she's expressing her feelings. The statement might be considered opinion because it's her personal view, even if it's harsh. Or maybe parts of it are factual accusations.

Also, for slander per se, certain categories of statements are considered so defamatory that damages are presumed. These include accusing someone of a crime of moral turpitude, having a loathsome disease, affecting someone's professional reputation, or serious sexual misconduct. So, accusing the lawyer of conspiring to commit crimes would fall into the crime category. Therefore, if that's considered a statement of fact, it could be slander per se.

But wait, if the statement is opinion, then it's not actionable. So, the key is whether "I know you're conspiring to commit crimes" is a statement of fact or opinion.

In the Supreme Court case of Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co., the court held that an opinion can be actionable if it implies a false underlying fact. So, if the resident's statement implies that she has knowledge of specific facts that the lawyer is conspiring, then it could be considered a factual assertion.

Alternatively, if it's just her opinion based on her observations (like seeing people enter the office), without any specific facts, then it's protected as opinion.

So, in this case, the resident's statement that the lawyer is conspiring to commit crimes is a factual assertion. She's not just saying she dislikes him; she's accusing him of criminal activity. That would likely be considered a defamatory statement of fact.

But then, is it true or false? The question doesn't say whether the lawyer is actually involved in criminal activity. So, the statement is false because there's no indication he's conspiring. Therefore, it's a false statement of fact that harms his reputation.

So, would the lawyer succeed? Let me look at the options.

Option A says he'll succeed because the remarks were offensive and damaging. But being offensive isn't enough; it has to be a false statement of fact.

Option D says he'll succeed because the resident falsely accused him of a crime. That seems to fit the slander per se category.

Option C says he won't succeed because it's opinion. If the statement is considered opinion, then he wouldn't. But if it's factual, then he would.

Option F says he'll succeed because it's slander per se. That would be the case if the statement accuses him of a crime, which it does.

So, either D or F could be correct. Let me think again. If the statement is slander per se, the lawyer doesn't have to prove damages because they're presumed. But whether it's slander per se depends on the content.

Accusing someone of a crime is one of the categories for slander per se. So, F would apply.

Alternatively, D says he can succeed because it's a false accusation of a crime, which is a factual statement. So both D and F seem correct, but what's the exact reasoning?

Wait, the defamation claim would require that the statement is defamatory, false, and published. If it's slander per se, the defamation is presumed, so the lawyer only needs to show that the statement was made, it was false, and it caused harm (which is presumed in slander per se cases).

So, in this case, the statement fits into slander per se because it accuses the lawyer of criminal conduct. Therefore, the correct answer would be F.

But let me check the other options. Option I says the remarks weren't published to anyone else. The call was just between the resident and the lawyer, so it wasn't published to a third party. Wait, in defamation, the statement must be communicated to a third party. If it's just a one-on-one conversation, does that count as publication?

Yes, because communication to any person other than the plaintiff is sufficient. So, the lawyer is the plaintiff, and the resident made the statement to him directly. The statement was communicated to the lawyer, but does that count as publication? I think in defamation, the statement must be published to a third party, meaning someone else besides the plaintiff. So, if the resident only told the lawyer, and no one else, then there's no publication. Therefore, the defamation claim would fail because the statement wasn't published to anyone else.

Wait, that's an important point. So, if the statement was only made to the plaintiff (the lawyer), then there's no publication, so no defamation. Because defamation requires that the statement be communicated to a third party who understood it.

So, in this scenario, the resident called the lawyer and made the statements directly to him. So, only the lawyer heard them. If that's the case, then there's no publication, so no defamation.

Looking back at the options:

Option I says the resident's remarks were not published or communicated to anyone but the plaintiff. So, if that's correct, the lawyer's claim would fail because there was no publication to a third party.

So, the initial analysis about slander per se might not matter if the statement wasn't published. Therefore, the correct answer would be I.

Wait, but in the scenario, the resident made the call, so the statement was communicated to the lawyer, but that's the plaintiff. So, for defamation, the statement must be published to someone else. If it's only to the plaintiff, then there's no defamation because there's no third-party publication.

So, in that case, the lawyer wouldn't succeed because the statement wasn't published to anyone else. So, the answer would be I.

So, putting it all together, the key points are:

1. The statement must be a false statement of fact. Here, accusing the lawyer of conspiring to commit crimes could be a factual statement, but if it's just an opinion, it's not actionable.

2. The statement must be published to a third party. If it's only between the two parties, then no publication, so no defamation.

In this case, the resident's statement was made directly to the lawyer. So, only the lawyer heard it. Therefore, there's no publication to a third party, so no defamation. Therefore, the lawyer's claim would fail, making option I the correct answer.

So, the answer must be I.

The question revolves around whether a lawyer can successfully assert a defamation claim against a resident based on a telephone call where the resident made derogatory and accusatory statements. To determine this, the elements of defamation must be analyzed: the statement must be a false assertion of fact, it must harm the plaintiff's reputation, and it must be published to a third party.

The resident's statements included calling the lawyer "scum," accusing him of conspiring to commit crimes, and suggesting that the police should arrest him. While these statements are harsh, the key issue is whether they constitute actionable defamation. For a statement to be defamatory, it must be a false statement of fact, not merely an opinion. Here, the resident's statements could be interpreted as opinions based on her personal beliefs and observations, which are protected under the First Amendment. However, accusing the lawyer of conspiring to commit crimes could be seen as a factual assertion, potentially falling under slander per se, which involves categories of statements so inherently harmful that damages are presumed (e.g., accusing someone of a crime).

Nevertheless, a critical factor in this case is the requirement of "publication." Defamation requires that the statement be communicated to a third party. In this scenario, the resident's statements were made directly to the lawyer in a private telephone call, with no evidence that they were shared with anyone else. Since the statements were not published to a third party, the defamation claim fails, regardless of whether the statements were factual or opinion.

Given this analysis, the lawyer's claim for defamation would not succeed because the resident's remarks were not published or communicated to anyone but the plaintiff.
