Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about what defines a simple random sample. Let me think through this step by step. 

First, I remember that a simple random sample is a type of sampling method in statistics. The key thing about it is that every individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected. But the question is about what defines it, so I need to focus on the characteristics that make a sample a simple random sample.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: the statistical analysis of the sample. Hmm, I don't think this is right. Statistical analysis is what you do after you've collected the sample. The method of selection is more about how you get the sample, not what you do with it afterward.

Option B: the location of the sample. Wait, location refers to where the sample is taken from, like a specific area. But a simple random sample doesn't necessarily have to do with the location. It's more about the selection process regardless of where the individuals are.

Option C: whether or not the sample is biased. Bias in a sample usually refers to if it's skewed in some way, not representing the population accurately. But I think a simple random sample is supposed to be unbiased because every individual has an equal chance. But does that mean that whether the sample is biased defines it? No, because bias is a result, not a defining factor. The method used to select the sample determines if it's biased or not.

Option D: both of the above. Since I don't think A or B are correct, D can't be right either.

Option E: the method of selection. Oh, this rings a bell. Yes, because a simple random sample is all about how you select the individuals. Each has an equal chance, and it's done without any bias in the selection process. So the method of selection should be the correct answer.

Option F: how representative the sample is of the population. Representativeness is more about the outcome. A simple random sample aims to be representative, but it's the method that defines it, not how well it represents the population. So F isn't the defining factor.

Option G: how diverse the sample is. Diversity might be a characteristic of the sample, but the simple random sample's definition isn't based on diversity. It's about equal probability, which can lead to diversity, but the definition itself is about the selection method.

Option H: examination of the outcome. This is again about what you do after the sample is taken, like analysis, which isn't what defines the sample type.

Option I: how many individuals are in the sample. The size of the sample (sample size) is a factor in statistics, but it doesn't define whether it's a simple random sample. You can have a small or large sample and still have it be a simple random sample.

Option J: the time period in which the sample is taken. The timing might affect the data collected, like if it's a certain season, but it doesn't define the sampling method as simple random.

So, putting it all together, the defining factor is the method of selection. Each individual must have an equal chance of being selected, which is the essence of a simple random sample.

A simple random sample is defined by the method of selection, where each individual in the population has an equal chance of being chosen. This ensures unbiased representation.
