Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the percentage of KCl in the soil sample. Hmm, let's see what the problem states.

Alright, the soil sample weighs 0.4210 grams and contains a mixture of KCl and NaCl weighing 0.0699 grams. From the KCl, 0.060 grams of AgCl is precipitated. I need to calculate the percent of KCl in the soil.

Wait, I remember that when AgNO3 reacts with KCl, it forms AgCl and KNO3. The reaction is AgNO3 + KCl → AgCl↓ + KNO3. So the mole ratio of AgCl to KCl is 1:1. That's because each mole of KCl produces one mole of AgCl.

So, first, I think I should find out how much KCl is present based on the AgCl precipitate. Let me calculate the moles of AgCl first. The molar mass of AgCl is Ag (107.87 g/mol) + Cl (35.45 g/mol) = 143.32 g/mol. 

So moles of AgCl = mass / molar mass = 0.060 g / 143.32 g/mol. Let me compute that. 0.060 divided by 143.32 is approximately 0.0004187 moles. Since the mole ratio is 1:1, that's also the moles of KCl present.

Now, I need to find the mass of KCl. The molar mass of KCl is K (39.10 g/mol) + Cl (35.45 g/mol) = 74.55 g/mol. So mass = moles * molar mass. That's 0.0004187 mol * 74.55 g/mol. Let me calculate that: 0.0004187 * 74.55 ≈ 0.0312 grams of KCl.

Wait, but the mixture of KCl and NaCl is 0.0699 grams. So the KCl is part of this mixture. The mass of KCl is 0.0312 g. So the percentage of KCl in the mixture is (0.0312 g / 0.0699 g) * 100%. Let me compute that: 0.0312 / 0.0699 is about 0.446, so 44.6%. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the options don't have 44%. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, no. Wait a second. Oh wait, no, wait. The question is asking for the percentage of KCl in the soil sample, not in the mixture. Oh right! So the mixture (KCl and NaCl) is 0.0699 grams, and that's part of the soil sample which is 0.4210 grams.

So, the mass of KCl in the soil is 0.0312 grams. To find the percentage, it's (0.0312 g / 0.4210 g) * 100%. Let me compute that. 0.0312 / 0.4210 is approximately 0.0741, so 7.41%. Looking at the options, option C is 7.41%. So that should be the answer.

Wait, let me double-check. Moles of AgCl: 0.060 / 143.32 = approx 0.0004187. Moles KCl same as AgCl, so 0.0004187. Mass KCl: 0.0004187 *74.55=0.0312g. Then, (0.0312 /0.4210 )*100 = ~7.41%. Yep, that's correct. So the answer is C.

To calculate the percent of KCl in the soil sample, we start by analyzing the reaction between AgNO₃ and KCl, which produces AgCl and KNO₃ in a 1:1 molar ratio. The mass of AgCl precipitated is 0.060 g, and its molar mass is 143.32 g/mol. The moles of AgCl formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of AgCl} = \frac{\text{Mass of AgCl}}{\text{Molar Mass of AgCl}} = \frac{0.060}{143.32} \approx 0.0004187 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Since the molar ratio of AgCl to KCl is 1:1, the moles of KCl are also 0.0004187 mol. The molar mass of KCl is 74.55 g/mol, so the mass of KCl is:

\[
\text{Mass of KCl} = \text{Moles of KCl} \times \text{Molar Mass of KCl} = 0.0004187 \times 74.55 \approx 0.0312 \, \text{g}.
\]

The mixture of KCl and NaCl in the soil sample weighs 0.0699 g. However, the question asks for the percentage of KCl in the entire soil sample, which weighs 0.4210 g. Thus, the percentage of KCl in the soil is:

\[
\text{Percent of KCl} = \left( \frac{\text{Mass of KCl}}{\text{Mass of Soil Sample}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{0.0312}{0.4210} \right) \times 100 \approx 7.41\%.
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is **C: 7.41%**.
