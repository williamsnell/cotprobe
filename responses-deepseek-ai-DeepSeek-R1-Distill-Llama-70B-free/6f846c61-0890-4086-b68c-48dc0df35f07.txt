Question:

A man who was an avid swimmer moved to a new town and began looking for a facility with a swimming pool that he could use. He signed an agreement with the local swimming club to use their swimming pool four times per week. The agreement, which had a duration of one year, stated that the man could use the poo1 four times per week for $250 per month, due on the first day of each month. For three months, the man paid the $250 on the first and made use of the swimming pool. Toward the middle of the third month, the man was involved in an automobile accident. Shortly thereafter, the man sent the following letter to the swimming club:"Please be advised that because of injuries sustained in an automobile accident, my physician has advised me not to engage in any strenuous activities. Since I will not be able to make use of the pool anymore, no further payments will be forthcoming. "Which of the following does not accurately state the immediate legal effect of the man's letter?

Options:

A: The swimming club must wait until the date of the next payment in order to sue the man for breach of contract.
B: The swimming club has the right to bar the man from any further use of the pooi.
C: The swimming club has the right to sue the man for the remaining balance of the contract immediately.
D: The man is legally obligated to continue paying for the full year, regardless of his ability to use the pool.
E: The man can be sued for the full amount of the contract if he does not retract his letter before the swimming club takes legal action.
F: The swimming club can only sue the man for breach of contract if he fails to pay the next scheduled payment.
G: The man may retract his repudiation if he does so before the swimming club initiates legal action against him.
H: The man's letter is considered a breach of contract, and the swimming club can seek damages immediately.
I: The man's letter serves as an immediate termination of the contract.

Okay, so I've got this contract law question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again and break it down.

So, the man signed a one-year agreement with a swimming club. He pays $250 a month, due on the first of each month. For three months, he paid on time and used the pool. Then, in the middle of the third month, he had a car accident. His doctor told him no strenuous activities, so he sent a letter saying he can't use the pool anymore and won't make any more payments.

The question is about the legal effect of his letter. The options are from A to I, and I need to pick which one does NOT accurately state the immediate effect.

First, I remember that when one party repudiates a contract (which is what the man is doing by saying he won't pay anymore), the other party has certain rights. Repudiation is an anticipatory breach, meaning the breach happens before the contract's end. So the non-breaching party can choose to either wait until the breach actually happens (like when the next payment is due) or they can act immediately.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The club must wait until the next payment date to sue. Hmm, no, I think they don't have to wait. Because the man has anticipatorily breached, the club can sue right away for the whole amount, or maybe for each missed payment as they come due. Wait, no, in some cases, like with installment contracts, the club might have to wait until each installment is due. But I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Option B: The club can bar him from using the pool. That makes sense because once he's breached, they can terminate the contract and not let him use the facilities anymore. So B is a correct effect, so the question is which option is incorrect.

Option C: The club can sue for the remaining balance immediately. I think this is possible if the contract is viewed as entirely breached, but sometimes, especially in monthly payment contracts, they might have to wait each month. So maybe C is incorrect because they can't get all the remaining money at once. Or maybe they can because it's a repudiation.

Option D: The man must pay for the full year regardless. That doesn't sound right. If the man can't perform due to a legitimate reason like medical advice, maybe he can terminate, but wait, the question is about the immediate effect of his letter. So if he repudiates, the club can choose to terminate and sue for damages, but I don't think he's obligated to pay the full year unless the contract has a clause that says so. But the question is about immediate effect, so maybe D is an incorrect statement.

Option E: The man can be sued for the full amount if he doesn't retract. That sounds accurate because once he repudiates, the club can treat the contract as breached and sue for all damages. So E is a correct effect.

Option F: The club can only sue if he misses the next payment. That would mean they have to wait, but I thought with anticipatory breach, they can sue immediately. So F might be incorrect.

Option G: The man can retract his repudiation before the club takes action. Yes, that's correct. If he changes his mind before the club acts, he can revoke the repudiation.

Option H: The letter is a breach, and the club can seek damages immediately. That aligns with anticipatory breach, so H is correct.

Option I: The letter immediately terminates the contract. Wait, no. The letter is a repudiation, which is a material breach, allowing the club to terminate, but the termination isn't automatic. The club has to choose to accept the repudiation. So I might be incorrect because the contract isn't immediately terminated; the club has to act on it.

Wait, the question is what does NOT accurately state the immediate effect. So which option is wrong.

So let's go through each option again.

The man sent a repudiation. That's an anticipatory breach. So the club can choose to either:

1. Treat the contract as breached and sue immediately for all damages, or
2. Wait and see if each payment is made, suing each time a payment is missed.

But some sources say that in cases of installment contracts, the non-breaching party can only recover for the installments as they become due, unless the contract allows for acceleration. So if the contract doesn't have an acceleration clause, the club can't sue for all future payments at once. They have to wait each month.

Wait, but in this case, the man's letter is a total repudiation, saying he won't pay anymore. So that's a material breach. So the club can choose to accelerate and sue for all remaining payments, but only if the contract allows it. If the contract doesn't have such a clause, maybe they can't.

Alternatively, in common law, a party can treat a repudiation as a total breach and recover all expected damages at once, but sometimes it's limited. I'm a bit confused here.

Looking back at the options:

Option C says the club can sue for the remaining balance immediately. If the contract allows for acceleration, then yes. But if the contract doesn't, maybe not. The question doesn't say the contract has such a clause, so maybe the club can't do that. So option C's statement might be incorrect.

Option F says the club can only sue if he fails to pay the next payment. That would mean they can't sue now, which might be correct if the contract doesn't allow for acceleration.

So, which options are incorrect?

The question asks which option does NOT accurately state the immediate effect.

Looking at the options again, the incorrect one is the one that's not a possible immediate effect.

Option D says the man is legally obligated to pay for the full year. But if he repudiates, the club can choose to terminate and sue for damages, but the man isn't necessarily obligated to pay the full year unless the contract has a liquidated damages clause or specific terms. So D seems incorrect because it's not accurate; the man might not have to pay the full year, depending on the terms and the club's response.

Wait, but the question is about the immediate effect of his letter. So the letter itself doesn't automatically terminate the contract; it's a repudiation. So the man is still obligated unless the club accepts the repudiation. So if the club doesn't accept it, the contract is still on, and the man would have to keep paying. But the man has made it clear he won't pay, so the club can choose to end it.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe I should approach this differently.

The question is which option is NOT an accurate immediate effect. So which option is wrong.

Option I says the letter serves as immediate termination. That's not correct because termination requires the non-breaching party to accept the repudiation. So I is incorrect.

But wait, another thought: when a repudiation is clear and material, the non-breaching party can choose to terminate immediately. So the effect is that the contract is at an end, but only if the non-breaching party elects to do so. So the letter itself doesn't terminate the contract; the club has to act on it.

So, the immediate effect is that the club can choose to terminate and sue, but the termination isn't automatic. So option I's statement is incorrect because the letter doesn't immediately terminate the contract; the club has to accept the repudiation.

Alternatively, the letter is an anticipatory breach, so the club can treat it as a breach and terminate, but the termination isn't immediate until they choose to do so.

So, looking at the options, the question is which does NOT accurately state the immediate effect.

Option I says the letter is an immediate termination. That's not accurate because the termination happens when the club chooses to accept the breach. So I is incorrect.

Wait, but the question is which option does NOT accurately state the immediate effect. So which is wrong.

So, the options:

A: Must wait until next payment to sue. If the club can sue immediately, then A is incorrect.

C: Can sue immediately for the remaining balance. If the contract doesn't allow acceleration, then C is incorrect.

I: Letter serves as immediate termination. That's incorrect because termination requires acceptance by the club.

So, the question is which option is incorrect.

Let me think about the doctrine of anticipatory breach. Once a repudiation occurs, the non-breaching party can choose to cancel the contract and sue immediately for damages. So the immediate effect is that the club can choose to treat the contract as breached and sue now.

So, the immediate effect is that the club has the right to sue immediately, not that the contract is terminated. So option I is incorrect because the termination isn't immediate; it's upon the club's decision.

But let me think about option D: the man is legally obligated to pay the full year regardless. That's not accurate because if the club accepts the repudiation, the contract is terminated, and the man's obligation ends, except for damages. So D is incorrect because the man doesn't have to pay the full year; he might have to pay damages, but not necessarily the full amount.

Wait, but the question is about the immediate effect of the man's letter. The letter doesn't release him from his obligations unless the club accepts the repudiation. So until the club acts, he's still obligated. But the man has made it clear he won't pay, so the club can choose to terminate.

So the immediate effect is that the club can choose to terminate and sue, but the man is still obligated until the club acts.

So looking back at the options:

Option D says the man is legally obligated to continue paying regardless. That's correct because his obligation continues until the contract is terminated by the club. So D is correct, so it's not the incorrect option.

Option I says the letter serves as immediate termination, which is incorrect. So I is the wrong statement.

Wait, but some sources say that a repudiation can, if material, allow the non-breaching party to treat the contract as terminated immediately. So does the letter itself terminate the contract, or does the club have to act?

I think the club has to elect to treat it as terminated. So without the club's action, the contract isn't terminated yet. Therefore, the letter doesn't immediately terminate the contract; the club can choose to do so.

So option I is incorrect, making it the answer to the question, as the question asks which option does NOT accurately state the immediate effect.

Wait, but the question is phrased as which option does NOT accurately state the immediate legal effect. So the incorrect option is the one that's not a correct effect.

Wait, the man's letter is a repudiation, which is an anticipatory breach. So the immediate effect is that the club can choose to terminate and sue for damages. So the club has the right to bar him from using the pool (B is correct). They can sue immediately (so C, E, H may be correct). They don't have to wait (so A is incorrect if they can sue now). Option D is incorrect because he's not obligated to pay the full year if the contract is terminated.

Wait, no. The man is obligated until the club terminates. So until the club acts, he's still on the hook. So D is correct in that he's legally obligated to continue paying regardless of his ability, unless the club releases him.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to outline each option:

A: Club must wait until next payment to sue. If they can sue immediately, A is incorrect.

B: Club can bar him. Correct, as they can terminate.

C: Club can sue for remaining balance immediately. Depends on whether they can accelerate.

D: Man must pay full year. Correct if the contract isn't terminated, but if the club terminates, he doesn't have to. So D is incorrect because the man can stop paying once the contract is terminated by the club.

E: Man can be sued for full amount if he doesn't retract. Correct because the club can treat it as a total breach.

F: Club can only sue if he misses next payment. Incorrect if they can sue now.

G: Man can retract before club acts. Correct.

H: Letter is breach, club can sue immediately. Correct.

I: Letter immediately terminates. Incorrect, because termination requires club's action.

So the question is which option is incorrect as an immediate effect.

The options that are incorrect are:

A: Must wait – incorrect if they can sue now.

C: Can sue for remaining balance – depends on contract terms, but without acceleration clause, maybe not.

D: Must pay full year – incorrect because once club terminates, he doesn't have to.

I: Immediate termination – incorrect.

So the question is which option does not accurately state the immediate effect.

Looking at the options, the incorrect immediate effects are options A, C (maybe), D, F, I.

But the question is asking which one does NOT accurately state the immediate effect. So the wrong option is the one that's not a correct effect.

So, for example, option I is incorrect because the termination isn't immediate. So the immediate effect of the letter is that the club can choose to terminate, but the contract isn't automatically terminated.

So the incorrect statement is I: the letter serves as immediate termination.

Therefore, the answer is I.
</think>

To determine which option does not accurately state the immediate legal effect of the man's letter, we must analyze the situation under contract law principles. The man's letter constitutes a repudiation of the contract, which is an anticipatory breach. This allows the swimming club to choose how to respond, such as treating the contract as terminated and suing for damages or waiting for further breaches. However, the termination of the contract is not automatic upon repudiation; the club must elect to accept the repudiation and terminate the agreement.

### Analysis of Each Option:
- **A**: Incorrect. The club does not have to wait until the next payment date to sue. Anticipatory breach allows the club to sue immediately for damages.
- **B**: Correct. The club can bar the man from further use of the pool as a response to the breach.
- **C**: Potentially incorrect. The club can sue immediately for damages due to anticipatory breach, but whether they can recover the full remaining balance depends on the contract terms (e.g., acceleration clauses). Without such clauses, they may need to sue for each missed payment as it becomes due.
- **D**: Incorrect. The man is not legally obligated to pay for the full year if the club elects to terminate the contract. His obligation ceases upon termination, though he may still owe damages.
- **E**: Correct. The club can sue the man for the full amount of the contract if he does not retract his repudiation before legal action is taken.
- **F**: Incorrect. The club does not have to wait for the next payment date to sue; anticipatory breach allows immediate legal action.
- **G**: Correct. The man can retract his repudiation if he does so before the club initiates legal action.
- **H**: Correct. The man's letter is a breach of contract, and the club can seek damages immediately due to anticipatory breach.
- **I**: Incorrect. The man's letter does not immediately terminate the contract. Termination occurs only when the club elects to accept the repudiation.

### Conclusion:
The immediate effect of the man's letter is that it constitutes a repudiation, allowing the club to choose how to respond, but the contract is not automatically terminated. Option **I** is incorrect because it inaccurately states that the letter serves as an immediate termination of the contract.
