Okay, so I have this DNA question here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The original DNA segment is 5’ – GGATCCTCATG – 3’. The question is about what happens when this DNA experiences both a point mutation and a deletion.

Hmm, I remember that DNA is double-stranded, so each strand has a complementary sequence. The given segment is one strand, and the other would be the reverse complement. But wait, the question is about mutations in this original segment, so I need to focus on changes happening here.

A point mutation is a change in a single nucleotide. That could be a substitution—like one base being replaced by another. A deletion is when a nucleotide is removed. So the result should have both of these changes.

Looking at the options, I need to find a DNA strand that is shorter than the original (since a deletion has occurred) and also has a different base somewhere (the point mutation).

The original sequence is 5’ GGATCCTCATG 3’ which is 11 bases long. Let me count the bases in each option to see which are shorter.

Option A: 5' - GGATCCTCA -3' → 10 bases. So it's shorter by one. But where's the change? Let me compare each base.

Original: G G A T C C T C A T G

Option A: G G A T C C T C A → Wait, the original ends with TG, and A ends with CA. So the last two bases are changed from TG to CA? Wait, but the original is 11 bases, option A is 10. So perhaps the last base G is deleted, and maybe a substitution happened.

Wait, but let me check. Original ends with ...CATG. Option A ends with ...CTCA. So the last part is different. Let me write out the original and compare:

Original: positions 1-11: G G A T C C T C A T G

Option A: positions 1-10: G G A T C C T C A

So the last part: in original, positions 9-11 are A T G. In option A, it's up to position 10: T C A. So position 9 is T in both, but position 10 in original is A, and in A it's A? Wait, no, wait:

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me write the original as positions 1-11: 1:G, 2:G, 3:A,4:T,5:C,6:C,7:T,8:C,9:A,10:T,11:G.

Option A is 10 bases: 1-10: G,G,A,T,C,C,T,C,A.

Wait, so comparing to original up to position 10:

Original position 10 is T. Option A's position 10 is A. So there's a substitution at position 10: T→A. And then the 11th position G is missing (deletion).

So option A has a substitution (T→A) and a deletion (lost the G at the end). That fulfills both a point mutation and a deletion. So this is a possibility.

Let me check other options to make sure.

Option B: 5’ – TGATCCCAG – 3’ → 10 bases. Wait, the original starts with GGATCC, and this starts with TGA. That seems like a big change. Maybe a substitution, but I'm not sure. Let me count.

Wait, original is 11 bases, option B is 10. So one deletion. But looking at the sequence, it's TGATCCCA G. That's quite different. Maybe it's a substitution and a deletion elsewhere, but not sure. Let me not get stuck here.

Option C: 5’ – GGATCCATG –3’ → 10 bases. Let's compare. Original is GGATCCTCATG (11). Option C is GGATCCATG (positions 1-10). So the original has CC T C A T G; option C has CC A T G. So perhaps a substitution and deletion. Let me see:

Original: positions 5-11: C C T C A T G.

Option C: positions 5-10: C C A T G.

So it looks like between position 6 and 7, the T and C are changed. Hmm, maybe a substitution where the T became A, and the C after it is deleted? Or maybe a substitution and deletion. I'm not sure, but I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Option D: 5' - GGATCCTCGT - 3' → 11 bases. So same length as original, so no deletion. So it can't be the answer because the question says there's a deletion. So D is out.

Option E: 5’ – GGTCCTCATC – 3’ → 11 bases. Same length as original. So no deletion, so can't be the right answer. Unless I'm missing a deletion somewhere else. Wait, let me check the sequence.

Original: G G A T C C T C A T G.

Option E: G G T C C T C A T C. So comparing each position:

1: G same.

2: G same.

3: A vs T → substitution here.

4: T vs C → substitution.

So multiple point mutations, but no deletion since same length. So E is out.

Option F: 5' - GGATCCGCATG - 3' → 11 bases. Same length as original. So no deletion. So it's out.

Option G: 5' - GGATCTCATG - 3' → 11 bases. Same length. So no deletion. Unless I'm missing something. Let me check the sequence.

Original: G G A T C C T C A T G.

Option G: G G A T C T C A T G.

Wait, position 6: in original, it's C. In G, it's T. So substitution at position 6 (C→T). But no deletion, so G is out.

Option H: 5' - GGATCCTCAT - 3' → 10 bases. So one deletion. Let's compare.

Original: position 10 is T, 11 is G. Option H ends at position 10: AT. So the last G is missing (deletion). But what about substitutions? Let's see:

Original positions 7-11: T C A T G.

Option H: positions 7-10: T C A T.

So the last base G is deleted. But any substitution? Let's check each position. It seems the same except for the deletion. So this would only be a deletion, not a point mutation. So H only has deletion, no substitution. So this can't be the correct answer because the question says both a mutation and a deletion.

Option I: 5' - GGATCCTCAG -3' → 11 bases. Same length as original. So no deletion. Unless I'm missing a substitution. Let's see:

Original: ...T C A T G.

Option I: ...T C A G.

Wait, original is 11 bases, option I's last is G. So substitution at position 11: G remains, but position 10 was T, now it's G?

Wait original: positions 9-11: A T G.

Option I: positions 9-11: A G.

Wait, that can't be. Wait, no. Let me write it correctly.

Original: 5' G G A T C C T C A T G 3'.

Option I: 5' G G A T C C T C A G 3'.

Wait, that's 11 bases. So the last base is changed from G to G? No, wait, the original is G at position 11. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, original: position 11 is G. Option I's last base is G. So same. But in position 10: original is T, option I has A?

No, wait. Let me list them:

Original positions 1-11: G G A T C C T C A T G.

Option I: positions 1-11: G G A T C C T C A G.

Wait, position 10 in original is T, in option I, position 10 is A. Wait no, option I's 10th position is A? Or is it something else?

Wait, let me count:

Option I: 5’ – G G A T C C T C A G – 3’ → 11 bases.

So positions 1-11: 1:G, 2:G,3:A,4:T,5:C,6:C,7:T,8:C,9:A,10:G,11:?

Wait no, that can't be. Let me recount.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me write each position.

Original:

1: G

2: G

3: A

4: T

5: C

6: C

7: T

8: C

9: A

10: T

11: G.

Option I:

1: G

2: G

3:A

4: T

5: C

6: C

7: T

8: C

9: A

10: G

11: ?

Wait, no. The option I is 11 letters, so position 11 would be the last G. Wait, the original is 11 bases; option I is also 11. So if the last base is G in both, maybe a substitution elsewhere.

Hmm, perhaps at position 10: original is T, option I is G. So substitution at position 10 (T→G) and no deletion. So it's a point mutation, but no deletion. So I is out.

Option J: 5’ – GCATCCTCATG – 3’ → 11 bases. So same length, no deletion. So J is out.

So, going back to the options, the only one that's shorter is A, B, C, H.

H had only a deletion, no substitution. So it's not the answer.

Option A: shorter by one, and has a substitution at position 10 (T→A), and deletion of the last G. So that's both a substitution and a deletion.

Option C: let's re-examine. Original is 11, C is 10. So comparing:

Original: positions 1-10: G G A T C C T C A T.

Option C: G G A T C C A T G.

Wait, perhaps I need to write both:

Original (positions 1-10): G G A T C C T C A T.

Option C: G G A T C C A T G.

Wait, perhaps the 'CT' in original becomes 'A T' in C? Or maybe I'm getting the positions wrong.

Alternatively, maybe I should compare the two sequences:

Original: 5’ G G A T C C T C A T G 3’ (11 bases).

Option C: 5’ G G A T C C A T G 3’ (10 bases).

Wait, so the original has 11, and C has 10. So perhaps the 'T C A T G' becomes 'A T G' in C.

Wait, maybe the 'T C' in positions 7-8 of original becomes 'A' in position 7 of C. So position 7: T→A (substitution), and position 8: C is deleted. So that would be a substitution and a deletion. Hmm, that would fit.

Wait, but how? Let me see:

Original: positions 5-11: C C T C A T G.

Option C: positions 5-10: C C A T G.

So in original, positions 7-8: T C.

In option C, position 7 is A, and the next is T.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me align them:

Original: ... C C T C A T G.

Option C: ... C C A T G.

So in original, after the two Cs, we have T C A T G.

In option C, after two Cs, it's A T G.

So, perhaps the T and C in positions 7 and 8 are replaced by A, and the rest is shifted. So position 7: T→A (substitution), and position 8: C is deleted. So that's a substitution and a deletion. So option C would have both changes.

Wait, but option C's length is 10, same as option A. So which one is correct?

The question says the original experiences both a point mutation and a deletion. So both changes are needed.

So let me reevaluate option A and C.

Option A:

Original: 5' G G A T C C T C A T G 3'.

Option A: 5' G G A T C C T C A 3'.

So the last base G is deleted, and the T at position 10 is changed to A. So substitution at position 10 (T→A), deletion at position 11 (G lost). So two changes: substitution and deletion.

Option C:

Original: 5' ... C C T C A T G.

Option C: 5' ... C C A T G.

So at position 7: T→A (substitution), position 8: C is deleted. So again, substitution and deletion.

So both A and C have substitution and deletion. Hmm. So how to decide which is the correct answer.

Wait, looking back at the question, the original is 5' – GGATCCTCATG –3’ (11 bases).

Option A is 10 bases, ends with ...CTCA.

Option C is 10 bases, ends with ...CATG.

Wait, no, let me re-examine the original option C.

Option C says: 5’ – GGATCCATG –3’. Let's count the bases.

G G A T C C A T G → 9 bases? Wait, no, let me count each letter:

G (1), G (2), A (3), T (4), C (5), C (6), A (7), T (8), G (9). Wait, so option C is 9 bases, not 10. But the original is 11. So that would mean two deletions? Or a substitution and a deletion.

Wait, but the question says one point mutation and one deletion. So maybe option C has more than one deletion, which would make it incorrect.

Wait, let me recount option C:

Option C: 5’ – G G A T C C A T G –3’ → that's 9 letters. So two deletions? Or maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me count each option carefully.

Original: 11 bases.

Option A: 10 bases.

Option C: 9 bases.

Wait, no. Let me look again.

Option C: 5’ – GGATCCATG –3’.

Breaking it down:

G G A T C C A T G.

Wait, that's 9 letters. Because each letter is a base.

So positions 1-9:

1: G

2: G

3: A

4: T

5: C

6: C

7: A

8: T

9: G.

So yes, 9 bases. So the original is 11, option C is 9. So two deletions. But the question requires a point mutation and a deletion. So perhaps option C has a substitution and a deletion, but another deletion as well, making it two deletions. So that would not fit the scenario of only a single deletion and a substitution.

So option C is less likely.

So back to option A: it's 10 bases. So just one deletion.

So the substitution is at position 10 (T→A), and deletion at position 11 (G lost). So that's one substitution and one deletion.

So option A fulfills both.

Wait, but earlier I thought option C also had substitution and deletion. But now I'm confused because I thought it's 9, but perhaps I'm wrong. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated option C's length.

Wait, let me recount option C.

5’ – G G A T C C A T G –3’ → G G A T C C A T G → 9 letters.

Yes, 9. So original is 11, so two bases are lost. So perhaps a substitution and a deletion of two bases. But the question asks for a point mutation (single substitution) and a deletion, which is the loss of a base. So if two bases are lost, that's two deletions, which is beyond the scope.

So that leaves option A as the correct answer.

Wait, but what about option B? Let me recheck.

Option B: 5’ – T G A T C C C A G –3’ → 10 letters. Comparing to original.

Original: G G A T C C T C A T G.

Option B: T G A T C C C A G.

So comparing each position:

1: G vs T → substitution.

2: G vs G → same.

3: A vs A → same.

4: T vs T → same.

5: C vs C → same.

6: C vs C → same.

7: T vs C → substitution.

8: C vs A → substitution.

9: A vs G → substitution.

10: T vs ... → in option B, it ends at G, which is position 10.

Wait, but the original has 11, so option B is 10, so one base deleted. But there are multiple substitutions. So this would be a substitution and a deletion, but multiple substitutions, which is beyond a single point mutation.

So the correct answer must be option A.

The original DNA sequence is 5’ – GGATCCTCATG – 3’, which is 11 bases long. The question asks for a DNA segment that has experienced both a point mutation (a single nucleotide substitution) and a deletion (loss of one nucleotide). 

### Analysis of Each Option:

1. **Option A: 5' – GGATCCTCA – 3'**  
   - Length: 10 bases (shorter by one base than the original).  
   - Comparison with the original sequence:  
     - The last base (G) is deleted.  
     - At position 10, the base changes from T to A (substitution).  
   - This option has **one substitution and one deletion**, fulfilling the criteria.  

2. **Option B: 5’ – TGATCCCAG – 3’**  
   - Length: 10 bases.  
   - Multiple substitutions are present, and one base is deleted.  
   - However, the presence of multiple substitutions makes this option inconsistent with the requirement of a single point mutation.  

3. **Option C: 5’ – GGATCCATG – 3’**  
   - Length: 9 bases (shorter by two bases than the original).  
   -
