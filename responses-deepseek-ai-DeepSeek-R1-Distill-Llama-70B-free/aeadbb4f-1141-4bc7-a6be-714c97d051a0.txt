Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about American public policy and its relative stability. The question is asking which factor is largely responsible for this stability. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to understand what's meant by "relative stability." I think it refers to how policies don't change too drastically or too quickly. So, the system has mechanisms that prevent sudden or extreme shifts in policy direction.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Direct democracy implementation. Direct democracy means people vote on policies directly, like referendums. I remember that direct democracy can lead to more fluctuation because it's subject to the whims of public opinion, which can change rapidly. So this might actually make policies less stable. So maybe A isn't the right answer.

Option B: Affirmative action programs. These are specific policies aimed at promoting equality. But I don't see how they directly contribute to the overall stability of all public policies. They're more about addressing specific social issues.

Option C: Constitutional fragmentation of power. The Constitution sets up a system where power is divided between branches (legislative, executive, judicial) and between federal and state governments. This separation of powers is supposed to prevent any one entity from making hasty changes. Checks and balances ensure that policies are thoroughly debated and require consensus, which can make policies more stable over time. This sounds promising.

Option D: Social media influence. Social media can amplify opinions and lead to quick shifts in public sentiment. It might cause more volatility in policy discussions rather than stability. So probably not D.

Option E: Cooperation between the two major parties. While cooperation can lead to more effective governance, the relative stability might come from the system's structure rather than the parties' cooperation, which can vary. If parties don't cooperate, gridlock can happen, but that's different from stability. Hmm, not sure yet.

Option F: Role of the military. The military's role is more about defense and national security. I don't see how it directly impacts the stability of public policy, except in specific areas like defense spending, but not overall.

Option G: Use of executive orders. Executive orders are a way for the president to bypass Congress, but they can be overturned by future presidents. This might lead to more changes in policy rather than stability.

Option H: Influence of international organizations. These organizations can affect policies, especially in areas like trade or treaties, but they don't directly stabilize the overall policy-making process. Plus, their influence might be more external.

Option I: Dominance of one political party. If one party is dominant, policies might change less because there's a consistent direction. But in the US, the system is designed with checks and balances, which prevent any single party from having too much power. So maybe this isn't the main factor.

Option J: Judicial activism. Judicial activism refers to courts taking an active role in shaping policy. This can lead to significant changes, which might not contribute to stability. If the judiciary is more passive, it could maintain existing policies, but I'm not sure if this is the primary factor.

So, putting it all together. The constitutional setup with separation of powers and checks and balances (Option C) is likely the main reason for the relative stability. This structure makes it hard to change policies quickly, requiring broad agreement and slowing down the process, which leads to more enduring policies.

The relative stability of American public policy is largely achieved through the constitutional fragmentation of power, which establishes a system of checks and balances among the branches of government and between federal and state levels. This structure prevents any single entity from unilaterally imposing rapid or drastic changes, ensuring that policies are thoroughly debated and require consensus. This mechanism is a key factor in maintaining stability.

Answer: C
