Okay, so I have this problem here about cat food costs, and I need to figure out how much a 6-pound bag would cost. Let me see... The problem says the cat food is $.47 per pound. So, I guess I need to multiply the cost per pound by the number of pounds to get the total cost.

Wait, right, so it's $.47 times 6. Hmm, let me do that calculation. Let me think, 47 cents times 6. So, 47 times 6 is... 47 times 6. Well, 40 times 6 is 240, and 7 times 6 is 42. So adding those together, 240 +42 is 282. Oh wait, but since it's dollars, I guess I have to consider the decimal places. Because 47 cents is 0.47 dollars.

So, 0.47 * 6. Let me write that out. 0.47 times 6. So, 6 times 0.4 is 2.4, and 6 times 0.07 is 0.42. Adding those together, 2.4 + 0.42 equals 2.82. So the total cost should be $2.82.

Now, looking at the options, let me check which one matches that. The options are A through J. Let's see:

A: $3.82 → No, that's higher.
B: $2.97 → Hmm, that's close but higher than my calculation.
C: $6.47 → Way too high.
D: $12.77 → Definitely not.
E: $2.82 → Oh, that's exactly what I got.
F: $1.47 → Too low.
G: $7.47 → No.
H: $8.22 → No.
I: $4.67 → No.
J: $5.02 → No.

So the correct answer should be option E, which is $2.82. I think that's right. Wait, did I do the multiplication correctly? Let me double-check. 6 times 47 is 282, and since the original is in dollars, it's 2.82. Yep, that's correct.
