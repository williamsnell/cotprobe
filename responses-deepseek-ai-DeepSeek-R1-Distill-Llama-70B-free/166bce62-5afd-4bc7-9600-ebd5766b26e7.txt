The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A highway patrol officer stopped a driver for speeding and found that the person had a suspended license. He allowed her husband to drive the car home but arrested her for driving under suspension. After securing her inside the squad car, he conducted a search of her vehicle. The officer found a bag of cocaine inside a zippered jacket on the back seat. He arrested her for possession and possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance. Prior to trial, the driver moved for suppression of the cocaine. Is it likely that the trial court will grant the suppression motion?

Options:

A: Yes, the motion will be granted because a search of a vehicle requires a search warrant unless there are exceptional exigent circumstances.
B: Yes, the motion will be granted because the officer did not have the driver's consent to search the car.
C: No, the motion will be denied because the officer had the right to search the car for officer safety reasons.
D: No, the motion will be denied because the officer had a reasonable suspicion to search the car due to the driver's suspended license.
E: No, the motion will be denied because the officer had probable cause to search the car after finding out about the suspended license.
F: No, the motion will be denied because this was a valid search incident to an arrest.
G: Yes, it must be suppressed because she was secured in the squad car and the police could not expect to find evidence relating to the current arrest in the car.
H: Yes, the motion will be granted because the cocaine was found in a personal item, not in plain sight.
I: No, the motion will be denied because there is no expectation of privacy toward property inside one's car.
J: Yes, the motion will be granted because the officer did not have a warrant to search the jacket on the back seat.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a legal situation involving a traffic stop, arrest, and a search. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, the scenario: A highway patrol officer stops a driver for speeding. He finds out her license is suspended. He lets her husband drive the car home but arrests her for driving under suspension. Then, after securing her in the squad car, he searches her vehicle and finds a bag of cocaine in a zippered jacket on the back seat. She moves to suppress the cocaine evidence before trial.

The question is whether the trial court will grant the suppression motion. The options are A through J, each giving a different reason.

I need to figure out the legal principles involved here. The key issue is the legality of the vehicle search. So, I remember that under the Fourth Amendment, searches and seizures need a warrant or an exception.

Let me think about the possible exceptions that apply here. One big exception is a search incident to a lawful arrest. But wait, that's usually limited to the area within the arrestee's immediate control. In this case, the driver was already secured in the squad car, so the car's interior might not be within her reach anymore.

Another exception is the automobile exception, which allows a warrantless search if there's probable cause. But for that, the officer must have probable cause to believe there's evidence in the car. Here, the officer found the suspended license, but does that give probable cause for drugs? I don't think so. The initial stop was for speeding, and suspended license doesn't necessarily relate to drugs. So maybe the automobile exception doesn't apply unless there's more.

Wait, but after arresting her and putting her in the squad car, does the officer have a right to search the vehicle under the search incident to arrest? I think the Supreme Court case of Arizona v. Gant is relevant here. In Gant, the Court held that police may search a vehicle incident to a lawful arrest of its occupants only if the arrestee is within reaching distance of the vehicle at the time of the search or if the officer has a reasonable belief that evidence of the offense of arrest is present in the vehicle.

In this case, the driver was secured inside the squad car, so she wasn't within reaching distance. The arrest was for driving under suspension, which is a traffic offense. The search found cocaine, which is unrelated to the suspended license. So under Gant, the officer would need either a warrant or another exception.

Another angle: the officer let her husband drive the car home. So the car wasn't impounded. If the car isn't impounded, the officer's authority to search under the search incident to arrest might be limited. Also, the fact that the cocaine was in a zippered jacket on the back seatâ€”maybe that's a closed container, which usually requires a warrant unless it's in plain view or under another exception.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A says the search requires a warrant unless exigent circumstances. That's generally true, but there are exceptions like search incident to arrest or probable cause under the automobile exception.

Option B says it's granted because no consent. But consent isn't the only factor here; the legality of the search without consent is the issue.

Option C: Denied because officer safety. I don't think officer safety justifies a full search; maybe a protective pat-down, but not a thorough search of the car.

Option D: Denied because reasonable suspicion due to suspended license. Suspended license alone doesn't give reasonable suspicion for drugs.

Option E: Denied because probable cause after suspended license. Again, suspended license doesn't equate to probable cause for drugs.

Option F: Denied because valid search incident to arrest. But under Gant, this might not apply since she's secured away.

Option G: Yes, because she's secured and no expectation of evidence in the car related to the arrest offense. This seems to align with Gant.

Option H: Yes, because found in a personal item not in plain sight. But if it's in plain view, the plain view doctrine applies. But if it's in a closed jacket, maybe not.

Option I: No, because no expectation of privacy in a car. That's not correct because there's an expectation of privacy in a car, though it's less than in a home.

Option J: Yes, because no warrant to search the jacket. Even if the car could be searched, closed containers inside may require a warrant.

So, considering Gant, the officer can't search the car incident to arrest once the suspect is secured and not near the car. Also, there's no probable cause mentioned for the drugs, just the suspended license. So the search was unconstitutional, and the evidence should be suppressed.

Looking at the options, G says the motion will be granted because she was secured, and police couldn't expect evidence related to the current arrest in the car. That fits with the Gant ruling.

The key issue in this case is whether the search of the vehicle was constitutional under the Fourth Amendment. The officer arrested the driver for driving under suspension, secured her in the squad car, and then searched the vehicle, finding a bag of cocaine in a zippered jacket on the back seat. The legality of the search depends on whether it fell under any recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement.

Under the Supreme Court's decision in *Arizona v. Gant*, a search of a vehicle incident to a lawful arrest is only permissible if the arrestee is within reaching distance of the vehicle at the time of the search or if the officer has a reasonable belief that evidence of the offense of arrest is present in the vehicle. Here, the driver was secured in the squad car, meaning she was not within reaching distance of the vehicle. Additionally, the offense of driving under suspension does not provide a basis for believing that evidence related to that offense would be found in the vehicle. Therefore, the search incident to arrest exception does not apply.

The automobile exception, which allows a warrantless search of a vehicle if there is probable cause to believe it contains evidence of a crime, also does not apply here. The driver's suspended license does not provide probable cause for the presence of drugs in the vehicle. Furthermore, the cocaine was found in a closed zippered jacket, which is a personal item, and there is no indication that it was in plain view or that exigent circumstances justified the search.

Given these facts, the search of the vehicle was unconstitutional under *Gant*, as the officer lacked the authority to search the vehicle after the driver was secured in the squad car and there was no reasonable basis to expect evidence related to the offense of arrest in the vehicle.

The correct answer is **G**, as the motion to suppress the cocaine will likely be granted because the driver was secured in the squad car, and the police could not reasonably expect to find evidence related to the current arrest in the car.

**Answer: G**
