Okay, so I've got this question about primary facial expressions, and I need to figure out which one isn't considered a primary. Let me start by recalling what I know about this topic.

I remember that Paul Ekman did a lot of work on facial expressions and emotions. He identified six basic emotions that are universally recognized across cultures. Those are happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust. These are the primary ones because they're innate and everyone, regardless of culture, can recognize and express them.

Looking at the options given:

A: surprise – that's one of Ekman's six, so it's primary.

B: contempt – wait, I think contempt might be a bit different. I remember that contempt is sometimes considered a secondary emotion because it's more complex. It's not as universally recognized as the others because it can vary more across cultures. So maybe contempt isn't a primary.

C: fear – yes, that's definitely one of the primary six.

D: sadness – also one of the primary ones, so that's not the answer.

E: anger – primary as well.

F: disgust – another primary emotion.

So the options are A, C, D, E, F as primary, and B: contempt as the one that's not primary. Therefore, the correct answer should be option B.

The question asks which of the listed options is not considered a primary facial expression. Based on Paul Ekman's work, the six universally recognized primary emotions are happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust. Contempt, while related to these emotions, is often classified as a secondary emotion due to its complexity and cultural variability. 

Options A (surprise), C (fear), D (sadness), E (anger), and F (disgust) are all primary emotions. Option B (contempt) is not considered a primary facial expression. 

Answer: B
