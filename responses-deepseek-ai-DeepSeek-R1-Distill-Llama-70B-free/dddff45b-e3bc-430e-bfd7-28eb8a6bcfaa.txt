Question:

One problem concerning space flight is the removal of carbon dioxide (CO_2, molecular weight = 44.0 g / mole) emitted by the human body (about 924 g of CO_2 per day). One solution is to react CO_2 with sodium hydroxide (NaOH, molecular weight = 40.0 g / mole) to form water and sodium carbonate (Na_2CO_3, molecular weight = 94 g / mole) according to the followingreation: 2NaOH + CO_2 \ding{217} NaCO_3- + H_2O. How muchNaOHmust be carried on board a space capsule to remove the CO_2 produced by an astronaut on a 10 day flight?

Options:

A: 20.5 kg
B: 15.7 kg
C: 22.0 kg
D: 18.9 kg
E: 21.2 kg
F: 14.5 kg
G: 19.6 kg
H: 16.8 kg
I: 23.4 kg
J: 17.3 kg

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about space flight and removing CO2. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. 

So the problem says that humans emit about 924 grams of CO2 per day. The astronaut is going on a 10-day flight, so first, I should calculate the total CO2 produced. Let me do that: 924 grams/day * 10 days = 9240 grams. Oh wait, 9240 grams is the same as 9.24 kilograms, right?

Now, the reaction given is 2NaOH + CO2 → Na2CO3 + H2O. Wait, the balanced equation is important here. So from the equation, 2 moles of NaOH react with 1 mole of CO2. That means the mole ratio of NaOH to CO2 is 2:1.

So I need to find out how much NaOH is needed to react with all that CO2. But first, I should probably work in moles to make it easier with the molar masses.

Let me start by finding the moles of CO2. The molecular weight of CO2 is given as 44.0 g/mol. So moles of CO2 = mass / molar mass. The total CO2 is 9240 grams. Moles = 9240 g / 44 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 9240 divided by 44. Let's see, 44 times 210 is 9240 (because 44*200=8800, and 44*10=440; 8800+440=9240). Oh wait no, wait. Wait 44 * 210 is 9240? Let me check: 44 * 200 is 8800, 44 *10 is 440, so yes, 8800 + 440 = 9240. So 210 moles of CO2.

Since the reaction ratio is 2 moles of NaOH per 1 mole of CO2, the moles of NaOH needed would be 2 * 210 = 420 moles.

Now, the molecular weight of NaOH is 40.0 g/mol. So the mass needed is moles * molar mass. That's 420 moles * 40 g/mol. Let's compute that: 420 *40 = 16800 grams. Oh, 16800 grams is 16.8 kilograms. Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake.

Wait, the total CO2 is 924 grams per day times 10 days is 9240 grams. 9240 divided by 44 is indeed 210 moles. Then 2 times 210 is 420 moles of NaOH. 420 times 40 is 16,800 grams, which is 16.8 kg. So looking at the options, option H is 16.8 kg. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything in the problem statement.

Wait, the reaction produces Na2CO3, but in the equation, it's written as NaCO3^- plus some water. Oh wait, no, the balanced equation is 2NaOH + CO2 → Na2CO3 + H2O. So yeah, it's correct. So the stoichiometry is 2:1. So the calculation should be correct.

So I think the answer is H: 16.8 kg.

To determine how much NaOH must be carried on board a space capsule to remove the CO₂ produced by an astronaut on a 10-day flight, we start by calculating the total CO₂ emitted. The astronaut emits 924 g of CO₂ per day, so over 10 days:

\[
\text{Total CO₂ emitted} = 924 \, \text{g/day} \times 10 \, \text{days} = 9240 \, \text{g}.
\]

Next, we calculate the moles of CO₂ using its molecular weight (44.0 g/mol):

\[
\text{Moles of CO₂} = \frac{\text{Mass of CO₂}}{\text{Molar mass of CO₂}} = \frac{9240 \, \text{g}}{44.0 \, \text{g/mol}} = 210 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The reaction provided is:

\[
2 \, \text{NaOH} + \text{CO₂} \rightarrow \text{Na₂CO₃} + \text{H₂O}.
\]

From the stoichiometry of the reaction, 2 moles of NaOH are required to react with 1 mole of CO₂. Therefore, the moles of NaOH needed are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 2 \times \text{Moles of CO₂} = 2 \times 210 \, \text{mol} = 420 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The molecular weight of NaOH is 40.0 g/mol, so the mass of NaOH required is:

\[
\text{Mass of NaOH} = \text{Moles of NaOH} \times \text{Molar mass of NaOH} = 420 \, \text{mol} \times 40.0 \, \text{g/mol} = 16800 \, \text{g}.
\]

Converting this to kilograms:

\[
\text{Mass of NaOH} = 16800 \, \text{g} = 16.8 \, \text{kg}.
\]

Thus, the amount of NaOH that must be carried on board is **16.8 kg**, which corresponds to option **H**.
