Question:

Whatare the differencebetween Marginal Fixed Cost (MFC), Marginal Variable Cost (MVC) and Marginal Total Cost (MC)?

Options:

A: MFC = 0, MVC = MC
B: MFC decreases as output increases, MVC = 0
C: MFC = MVC, MC increases as output decreases
D: MFC = MC, MVC increases with each additional unit produced
E: MFC = MC, MVC = 0
F: MFC increases as output increases, MVC = MC
G: MFC = MVC = MC
H: MFC = 0, MVC increases with each additional unit produced, MC = MFC + MVC
I: MFC > MVC, MC = MFC + MVC
J: MFC = MVC, MC = 0

Okay, so I've got this question about marginal costs in economics, and I'm trying to figure it out. Hmm, the question is asking about the differences between Marginal Fixed Cost (MFC), Marginal Variable Cost (MVC), and Marginal Total Cost (MC). I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, I remember that fixed costs are expenses that don't change with the level of production. Like rent or salaries that you have to pay regardless of how much you produce. Variable costs, on the other hand, do change with output. Things like raw materials or hourly wages would fall into this category.

So, marginal fixed cost (MFC) must be the additional fixed cost of producing one more unit. But wait, fixed costs don't change with production, right? So if I produce one more unit, my fixed costs don't increase. That would mean MFC is zero because there's no change in fixed costs when output changes. Oh, that makes sense.

Next, marginal variable cost (MVC) is the additional variable cost of producing one more unit. So as I produce more, variable costs increase. For example, each additional widget I make requires more materials, so MVC would be the cost of those materials for that extra widget. So MVC is definitely not zero and it changes with output.

Then, marginal total cost (MC) is the total additional cost of producing one more unit. That would be the sum of the additional fixed and variable costs. Wait, but since MFC is zero, MC should be equal to MVC. Because MC = MFC + MVC. Oh right, because MFC is zero, so MC = MVC.

Let me recap: MFC is zero, MVC is the change in variable costs, and MC equals MVC since MFC is zero. So looking at the options, I need to find the one where MFC is zero, MVC equals MC.

Looking at the options:

Option A: MFC=0, MVC=MC. That fits what I was thinking.

Option E: MFC=MC, MVC=0. No, that's the opposite. Because MVC isn't zero.

Option H: MFC=0, MVC increases with each unit, MC= MFC + MVC. So for H, since MFC is zero, MC would be MVC, but H says MC is the sum. Wait, but if MFC is zero, then MC is just MVC, so H says MC=0 + MVC, which is correct. But in this option, it also says MVC increases with each additional unit. Hmm, that's possible. But the answer choice might not hinge on whether MVC increases or not, but the definitions.

Wait, the question is about the definitions, not about how they behave as output changes. So in terms of definitions, MFC is always zero because fixed costs don't change. So MC = MVC because MFC is zero.

So looking back, the correct option would be where MFC is zero, and MVC equals MC. That's option A: MFC=0, MVC=MC.

Wait, let me check the other options again. Option E says MFC=MC and MVC=0. That's wrong because MFC is zero and MC is MVC.

Option A is the best fit.

The question asks about the differences between Marginal Fixed Cost (MFC), Marginal Variable Cost (MVC), and Marginal Total Cost (MC). Here's the analysis:

1. **Marginal Fixed Cost (MFC)**: Fixed costs remain unchanged regardless of the level of production. Therefore, the additional fixed cost of producing one more unit is zero. Hence, **MFC = 0**.

2. **Marginal Variable Cost (MVC)**: Variable costs change with the level of production. MVC represents the additional variable cost of producing one more unit. Thus, **MVC is not zero** and depends on the production level.

3. **Marginal Total Cost (MC)**: MC is the total additional cost of producing one more unit. Since MC is the sum of MFC and MVC, and MFC = 0, it follows that **MC = MVC**.

Given these definitions, the correct option is the one where **MFC = 0** and **MVC = MC**. This matches **Option A**.
