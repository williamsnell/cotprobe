Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about ethics in psychology, specifically related to consulting with a colleague. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct answer based on what I know about the APA and Canadian ethics codes.

The question is about whether I need to get a client's permission before discussing their case with a colleague. Let me think about this. I remember that confidentiality is a big part of these ethics codes. So when a psychologist wants to consult with another professional, they have to respect the client's privacy.

Wait, the APA Ethics Code has something about this. I think it says that psychologists can discuss cases with other professionals without client consent as long as it's for professional purposes and they don't reveal identifying information. But I'm not entirely sure. Or maybe they do need some kind of consent.

Looking at the options:

Option A says you need permission from both the client and the consultant. That seems too strict because usually, the consultant doesn't need to give permission; it's about the client's consent.

Option B says you must always get permission from the client. That might be too absolute. Are there cases where you don't need it?

Option C: Only if sensitive info is revealed. Hmm, that sounds possible. But maybe even without sensitive info, you might still need consent because it's about the client's case.

Option D: Permission only if the consultant isn't part of the same organization. I don't think the organization matters; it's more about the client's info.

Option E: Permission only if client's identity is revealed. Wait, if you're discussing the case without the client's name or identifying details, maybe you don't need permission. So if you're revealing identity, then yes. But I'm not sure if that's the rule.

Option F: Consult without permission only in emergencies. That seems like a special case, but the question is about general practice.

Option G: Don't need permission because the consultant is clearly connected. I'm not familiar with that term, maybe it's a made-up option.

Option H: No permission if a general waiver is signed. Maybe, but I don't recall if a general waiver covers all consultations.

Option I: Discuss with client but decision is up to the professional. That sounds like informed consent, but I'm not sure if the professional can decide without the client's agreement.

Option J: No permission if it's a general aspect. Like, if you're talking about a treatment approach without specifics about the client. But I think even then, it's about the client's case, so maybe consent is still needed.

Wait, I think the key here is whether the discussion includes personal information. If it's about the client's specific case, even without their name, you might still need consent. Or maybe not. I'm a bit confused.

I remember that the APA Ethics Code (like 4.06) says that psychologists may disclose confidential information without consent if it's to another professional for consultation, as long as they don't release the client's identity. But wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Or perhaps they can discuss the case in a way that doesn't reveal identity, so no consent is needed.

Alternatively, the Canadian Code of Ethics might have different stipulations. I think the Canadian code emphasizes informed consent more. For example, if you're consulting with another professional, you should inform the client and get their consent unless it's an emergency.

Wait, so maybe the correct answer is that you must obtain permission from the client before discussing the case. So that would point to option B or E.

Wait, option B says you must always obtain permission. Option E says only if you reveal identity.

I think the general rule is that you don't need explicit consent if you're discussing the case in a way that doesn't identify the client. For example, using pseudonyms or discussing the case in general terms without personal details. But if the consultant needs to know who the client is, then you'd need consent.

So the correct answer would be that you must obtain permission if you're revealing the client's identity. So option E.

Wait, but I'm getting confused because I'm not remembering the exact code sections. Another approach: what's the standard practice? Usually, when consulting with a colleague, you don't need explicit consent as long as you're not sharing identifying information. So the client's identity is protected, so no consent is needed. But if you have to reveal their identity, then you need consent.

So looking back, option E says you must get permission only if revealing the client's identity. That sounds correct.

Alternatively, option B says you must always get permission, which seems too broad. Because if you're just discussing the case without any identifiers, perhaps you don't need explicit consent.

Wait, the question is about APA's code and the Canadian code. Are they the same on this? I think the Canadian code might require more explicit consent. Wait, no, I think both allow for such consultations without consent as long as confidentiality is maintained.

So the correct answer would be E: you must obtain permission only if you're revealing the client's identity.

Wait, but let me think again. If the consultant is part of the same organization, maybe it's considered part of the treatment team and no consent is needed. But the question is about a colleague, not necessarily part of the same team.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B, that you must always obtain permission. Because the question is about discussing a specific aspect of the case, which implies that it's about the client's personal information.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should try to recall the exact rules. In the APA code, section 4.06 talks about consultations. It says that psychologists may disclose confidential information without consent if it's to another mental health professional for the purpose of consultation, as long as they take reasonable steps to protect confidentiality, such as not revealing the client's identity.

So in that case, if you're discussing the case without revealing the client's identity, you don't need consent. So the only time you need consent is when you're revealing the client's identity.

So the correct answer would be E.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

E: you must obtain permission from the client only if you will be revealing the client's identity to the consultant.

Yes, that matches with the APA code. So the answer is E.

The question revolves around whether a psychologist needs to obtain a client's permission before consulting with a colleague about a specific aspect of the case. This requires an analysis of the APA Ethics Code and the Canadian Code of Ethics, both of which emphasize confidentiality and informed consent.

Key points to consider:

1. **Option A**: Suggests obtaining permission from both the client and the consultant. This is overly restrictive, as the consultant does not need to grant permission—it is the client's confidentiality that is paramount.

2. **Option B**: States that permission must always be obtained from the client. This is too absolute, as there are scenarios (e.g., discussing the case without revealing identifying information) where explicit consent may not be required.

3. **Option C**: Proposes that permission is needed only if sensitive information is revealed. However, even general discussions about the case may involve client-specific details, making this option incomplete.

4. **Option D**: Suggests permission is needed only if the consultant is outside the same organization. This is incorrect, as the requirement for consent is not dependent on the consultant's organizational affiliation.

5. **Option E**: Indicates that permission is required only if the client's identity is revealed. This aligns with the APA Ethics Code (Section 4.06), which allows consultations without consent as long as confidentiality is maintained and the client's identity is not disclosed.

6. **Option F**: States that consultation without permission is allowed only in emergencies. While true in emergency situations, this does not address the general scenario described in the question.

7. **Option G**: Claims no permission is needed because the consultant is "clearly connected" to the case. This term is not standard in ethics codes, making this option invalid.

8. **Option H**: Suggests no permission is needed if a general waiver is signed. This is incorrect, as a general waiver does not necessarily cover all consultations.

9. **Option I**: States that the professional can make the final decision after discussing with the client. This contradicts the ethical requirement to obtain consent in certain situations.

10. **Option J**: Proposes that no permission is needed if the consultation is about a general aspect of the case. However, even general discussions may involve client-specific information, requiring consent if identity is revealed.

The APA Ethics Code permits psychologists to consult with colleagues without client consent as long as confidentiality is maintained and the client's identity is not disclosed. Therefore, the correct answer is that permission is required only if the client's identity is revealed during the consultation.

**Answer: E**
