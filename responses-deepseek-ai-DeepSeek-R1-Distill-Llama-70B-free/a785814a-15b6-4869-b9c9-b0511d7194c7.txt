Okay, so I need to figure out this question about Hare's claims on moral arguments. Hmm, I remember that Hare was a philosopher, probably in ethics. I think he had something to do with utilitarianism, but wait, no, maybe it's more about the structure of moral arguments.

Wait, I recall that R.M. Hare talked about moral language and reasoning. He was into the idea that moral statements can be prescriptive and universalizable. Oh right, he argued that moral judgments are a type of prescriptive language, not just descriptive. And that they should be universal, meaning if you make a moral judgment, you should be willing to apply it in similar situations.

So the question is asking what Hare claims about all moral arguments. The options are A to D. Let me look at the options again: A is useless, B is valid, C is ad hominem, D is sound.

Hmm, Hare wouldn't say they're useless because he's trying to establish a basis for moral reasoning. Ad hominem refers to attacking the person rather than the argument, which doesn't fit here. Sound arguments are those that are valid and have true premises, but I'm not sure if he said all are sound.

Wait, I think Hare's point was that moral arguments can be rationally discussed and that they are based on logical principles. He might have said that they are valid, but I'm not certain. Or maybe he said they are universalizable, which makes them valid in a certain way.

Alternatively, could he have said that all moral arguments are valid? That doesn't sound right because some moral arguments are flawed. Maybe he meant that they can be validated through reasoning.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing Hare with someone else. Another thought: Hare's theory is called universal prescriptivism. So he believes that moral statements are prescriptions that can be universally applied. So when someone makes a moral judgment, they're committing themselves to that principle in all similar cases.

But the question is about all moral arguments. So perhaps he's saying that they are valid if they meet certain criteria, but the question says he claims all are something.

Wait, another angle. I think Hare argued that moral disagreements can be rationally resolved through discussion because moral statements have a logical structure. So perhaps he says that all moral arguments are valid in the sense that they can be evaluated for their logical consistency.

Wait, no, that's not exactly it. Because not all moral arguments are logically valid. Maybe he's saying that all moral arguments are a type of valid reasoning, but that doesn't make sense because people make mistakes.

Wait, maybe the answer is B: valid. Or perhaps I'm mixing this up. Alternatively, maybe Hare said that all moral arguments are either sound or can be made sound through universalization, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D: sound. But I think soundness requires both validity and true premises, which is a stricter condition.

Wait, let me think again. Hare's main point is that moral language is prescriptive and that moral reasoning must be universal. So when someone makes a moral judgment, they must be prepared to apply it universally. So perhaps he argues that all moral arguments are universalizable, but that's not one of the options here.

Wait, the question is about what Hare claims that all moral arguments are. The options are useless, valid, ad hominem, or sound.

I think the key here is that Hare believes that moral arguments can be rationally assessed, so they are not useless. He wouldn't say they're ad hominem because that's a type of fallacy. So between B and D.

Wait, the term "valid" in logic refers to the structure of the argument, not the truth of the premises. So an argument can be valid even if the premises are false. Hare might say that moral arguments can be valid if they follow proper logical structure, but he doesn't mean that all of them are valid.

Wait, but the question says Hare claims that all moral arguments are... So it's not about their structure but perhaps their nature.

Wait, I think I remember Hare's book "The Language of Morals." In it, he talks about how moral words function in language. He argues that they have a prescriptive meaning and that moral reasoning is possible because of their universal nature.

But the question is about moral arguments. So perhaps he's saying that they are valid because they can be logically evaluated. Or maybe he's saying that all moral arguments are valid in the sense that they're based on universal principles.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the answer is A: useless. But that doesn't make sense because Hare is all about moral reasoning being possible.

Wait, another angle: Hare was critical of emotivism, which says that moral statements are just expressions of emotion and not rational. So he argues against that, saying that moral arguments can be rationally discussed and are not just about personal preference.

So if emotivists think moral arguments are useless because they can't be rationally decided, Hare would disagree and say they are valid.

So the answer would be B: valid.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to recall any specific quotes or concepts.

Hare believed that moral statements are prescriptive and have universal application. So when someone says something is right, they're committing to that action being right in all similar situations.

In terms of arguments, he might argue that all moral arguments are valid in the sense that they can be evaluated for their universal applicability. But again, that's not exactly matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps he says that all moral arguments are valid because they are based on logical principles, but that doesn't sound right because not all moral arguments are logically valid.

Hmm, this is tricky. Another thought: Hare's position is that moral arguments can be rationally assessed, so they are valid as a form of reasoning. But the question is what he claims all moral arguments are.

Wait, perhaps the answer is B: valid. Because he's arguing against the idea that they're useless or emotional, so he'd say they are valid.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is D: sound. But soundness requires both validity and true premises, which is a stronger claim, and I don't think Hare would say all moral arguments are sound.

So I'm leaning towards B: valid.

Hare was a philosopher known for his work in ethics, particularly his theory of universal prescriptivism. He argued that moral statements are prescriptive and universalizable, meaning that if one makes a moral judgment, they should be willing to apply it consistently in similar situations. This indicates that Hare believed moral arguments have a logical structure and can be rationally evaluated. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A: useless** — This is inconsistent with Hare's view, as he emphasized the rationality of moral discourse and the possibility of resolving moral disagreements through reasoning.
- **B: valid** — This aligns with Hare's argument that moral arguments can be logically structured and evaluated for their universal applicability.
- **C: ad hominem** — This refers to a type of fallacy and does not fit Hare's position on moral arguments.
- **D: sound** — Soundness requires both validity and true premises, which is a stricter condition than what Hare likely intended when discussing moral arguments.

Given Hare's emphasis on the logical structure and universalizability of moral arguments, the most fitting answer is **B: valid**.

Answer: B
