Okay, so I've got this statistics question here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the sample has a standard deviation of zero, and I need to choose the correct statement from the options given.

Hmm, standard deviation. I remember that standard deviation measures the spread of the data. A high standard deviation means the data is spread out, while a low one means it's clustered around the mean. But if the standard deviation is zero... wait, that must mean there's no spread at all. So all the data points are exactly the same, right?

So in a sample where every data point is identical, the mean would be equal to each of those data points. Also, the mode, which is the most frequently occurring value, would be that same value because all are the same. So the mean and mode are equal. But wait, let me check the options. Option B says the sample mean and mode are not equal. If they are the same, then B is false. So I can eliminate B.

What about the median? The median is the middle value when data is ordered. If all numbers are the same, the median would be that same number. So the mean and median would be equal. That would make option I correct. Because I says the sample mean and sample median are equal. That makes sense.

Looking at the other options. Option A says the population mean is zero. Wait, no. The sample's standard deviation is zero, but the mean could be any number, not necessarily zero. So A isn't necessarily true.

Option C says the sample size must be very small. No, the sample could be any size, as long as all data points are the same. Even a large sample where every value is identical would have a standard deviation of zero. So C isn't necessarily correct.

Options D and E: D says all data points are outliers. But wait, an outlier is a data point that's significantly different from others. If all points are the same, there are no outliers. So D is wrong. E says the sample may have outliers. Well, if all points are the same, there can't be any. So E is incorrect.

Option F suggests a skewed distribution. But if all data points are the same, the distribution isn't skewed; it's just a single point. So F is wrong.

Option G says the population's standard deviation is zero. Well, the sample's standard deviation is zero, but we can't be sure about the population unless the sample is the entire population. But the question doesn't specify that. So G might not be correct.

Option H says the population has a symmetric distribution. Well, again, we don't know about the population. The sample's distribution is symmetric because all points are the same, but unless the sample is the whole population, H isn't necessarily true.

So putting it all together: standard deviation zero means all data points equal. Therefore, mean equals median, making option I correct.

When the standard deviation of a sample is zero, it indicates that all data points in the sample are identical. This has several implications:

- **Option A**: The population mean being zero is not necessarily true. The sample mean could be any value, but the population mean is unknown unless the sample is the entire population.
- **Option B**: The sample mean and mode are not equal. This is false because, with all data points being the same, the mean, mode, and median are all equal.
- **Option C**: The sample size must be very small. This is incorrect because the sample size could be large, as long as all data points are identical.
- **Option D**: All data points in the sample are outliers. This is false because outliers are data points significantly different from others, and with all points being the same, there are no outliers.
- **Option E**: The sample may have outliers. This is also incorrect because, as stated, there are no outliers when all data points are identical.
- **Option F**: The sample has a skewed distribution. This is false because a distribution where all data points are the same is not skewed; it is symmetric.
- **Option G**: The standard deviation of the population is also zero. This is not necessarily true unless the sample is the entire population.
- **Option H**: The population has a symmetric distribution. While the sample is symmetric, this cannot be assumed for the population unless the sample represents the entire population.
- **Option I**: The sample mean and sample median are equal. This is true because, with all data points being the same, the mean and median must be equal.

Thus, the correct answer is **I: The sample mean and sample median are equal.**
