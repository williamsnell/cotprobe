Question:

The schedule for a music showcase includes 3 sets that are 20 minutes each and 1 set that is 40 minutes. There is a 10-minute break between each set. The total length of the music showcase is 3(20 + 10) + 40 minutes. What is the total length of the music showcase?

Options:

A: 160 minutes
B: 140 minutes
C: 73 minutes
D: 120 minutes
E: 110 minutes
F: 200 minutes
G: 150 minutes
H: 210 minutes
I: 180 minutes
J: 130 minutes

Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a music showcase schedule, and I need to figure out the total length. Hmm, let's see. The problem says there are 3 sets that are 20 minutes each and 1 set that's 40 minutes. Also, there's a 10-minute break between each set. The total length is given by the expression 3(20 + 10) + 40 minutes. Wait, but I should probably break it down step by step to make sure I understand.

First, let's think about the structure of the showcase. There are four sets in total: three 20-minute sets and one 40-minute set. And between each set, there's a 10-minute break. So, the breaks come after each set except the last one, right? Because after the last set, there's no more performance, so no break needed.

Let me count the number of breaks. Since there are four sets, the breaks would be after set 1, set 2, and set 3. So that's three breaks total. Each break is 10 minutes, so 3 breaks * 10 minutes each = 30 minutes total for breaks.

Now, let's calculate the total performance time. The three 20-minute sets add up to 3 * 20 = 60 minutes. Plus the one 40-minute set, so 60 + 40 = 100 minutes of performance.

Wait, but the problem gives the expression 3(20 + 10) + 40. Let me check that. 3 times (20 +10) is 3*30=90, plus 40 is 130. Hmm, but wait, according to my earlier calculation, the breaks are only 3 times 10, which is 30, and the performance time is 100, so total would be 130. So that matches the expression's result.

So, the calculation would be: 3 sets of 20 minutes, each followed by a 10-minute break. So for each of those three, it's 20 + 10. Then the last set is 40 minutes with no break after.

So 3*(20+10) is 3*30=90 minutes (which includes the first three sets and their breaks). Then add the last 40-minute set, so 90 +40=130 minutes total.

Looking at the options, option J is 130 minutes.

Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's lay out the timeline:

- Set 1: 20 minutes, then 10 break (total so far 30)
- Set 2: 20, then 10 (total 60)
- Set 3: 20, then 10 (total 90)
- Set 4: 40 (no break after)

So total time is 90 +40=130. Yep, that's correct. So the answer should be J: 130 minutes.

The total length of the music showcase is calculated by considering both the performance times and the breaks. There are three 20-minute sets and one 40-minute set, with a 10-minute break after each of the first three sets. This results in:

- Performance time: \(3 \times 20 + 40 = 100\) minutes  
- Break time: \(3 \times 10 = 30\) minutes  

Adding these together gives \(100 + 30 = 130\) minutes. The expression provided, \(3(20 + 10) + 40\), also simplifies to 130 minutes. Therefore, the correct answer is:

J: 130 minutes.
