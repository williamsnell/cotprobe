Okay, so I've got this problem here about Mr. Allyn and a note he received. Hmm, I need to figure out the proceeds when the bank discounts the note. Let me break this down step by step.

Alright, the note is for $1800 at 6% interest over 90 days. The date on the note is March 31, and it's due June 29. So, wait, March 31 to June 29—let me check how many days that is. March has 31 days, so from March 31 to April 30 is 30 days, then May has 31, and then up to June 29. Wait, let me calculate that properly.

Wait, if the note is dated March 31 and due June 29, that's exactly 90 days because each month has 30 days sometimes, but let me count. March 31 to April 30 is 30 days, April 30 to May 31 is another 31, and May 31 to June 29 is 29 days. Wait, that adds up to 30 + 31 + 29 = 90 days. So the term is 90 days.

So the note is a 90-day note with face value $1800 and 6% interest. But wait, I think the interest rate might be the discount rate or the coupon rate. Oh, right, for discounting, the bank is essentially buying the note before it's due and giving the present value.

On April 20, the bank discounts the note at 6%. So Mr. Allyn is getting the money before the due date, and the bank is discounting it. So we need to calculate the present value of the note as of April 20.

Wait, first, how many days have passed between March 31 and April 20? Let me see. March 31 is day 0. April 1 to April 20 is 20 days. So that's 20 days that have passed. So the remaining days until June 29 would be 90 - 20 = 70 days.

Wait, no, wait a second. Because the note is due on June 29, which is 90 days from March 31. So if it's April 20, that's 20 days after March 31. So the time remaining is 70 days.

Wait, but when calculating the discount, do I use the remaining days or the total days? Oh right, the discount is based on the time left until maturity. Because the bank is holding it until June 29, so the time remaining is 70 days.

Okay, so the discount formula is: the face value multiplied by the discount rate, multiplied by the time in years. Then subtract that discount from the face value to get the proceeds.

Alternatively, another way is to calculate the present value: face value divided by (1 + (rate * time)), which gives the amount the bank pays Mr. Allyn.

Wait, but for simple interest, which is typically used in these discounting calculations, the discount is calculated as principal × rate × time. Then, the proceeds are the face value minus the discount.

So let me get this straight. The discount is 1800 * 6% * (70/360). Wait, because the rate is 6%, and time is 70 days. The year is often taken as 360 days in banking calculations.

So, discount = 1800 * 0.06 * (70/360). Let's compute that.

First, 0.06 multiplied by 70 is 4.2. Then, 4.2 divided by 360 is 0.011666... So 1800 * 0.011666... equals approximately 21. So the discount is $21.

Wait, but wait, let me do exact calculations. 70/360 is 7/36. So 0.06 is 6/100. Multiply 6/100 by 7/36: (6*7)/(100*36) = 42/3600 = 7/600. So 1800 * (7/600) = (1800 *7)/600. 1800 divided by 600 is 3, so 3*7=21. So discount is $21.

So the proceeds would be the face value minus the discount. So 1800 -21= $1779. But wait, looking at the options, I don't see 1779. The options given are A:1830, B:1785, C:1810, D:1799.50, E:1775.32, F:1805.68, G:1795.68, H:21.32, I:1827, J:27.

Hmm, none of them is 1779. So maybe I did something wrong. Let me think again.

Wait a second, perhaps I'm using the wrong method. Alternatively, maybe the interest is being calculated differently. Oh, wait, the note is dated March 31, so the 90 days runs from March 31 to June 29, which is correct.

But when the bank discounts it on April 20, which is 20 days after the issue date. So the time remaining is 70 days.

Wait, but maybe the discount is calculated as (face value) multiplied by (rate) multiplied by (time in years). So 70 days is 70/360 years, so 0.194444... years.

So discount = 1800 * 0.06 * (70/360). Which we calculated as $21. So proceeds are 1800 - 21 = 1779.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me read the question again.

Wait, perhaps the interest on the note is 6% per annum, so the note itself has an interest rate of 6%? Or is the discount rate 6%? Because the question says the bank discounted the note at 6%.

Wait, the note is a 6% note, and the bank is discounting it at 6% as well? Or is the bank using a different rate? Let me see.

The question states: "On April 20, his bank discounted the note at 6%." So the discount rate is 6%.

So, the note's face value is $1800, due in 90 days from March 31, so June 29. On April 20, which is 20 days later, so 70 days remaining.

So the discount is 1800 * 0.06 * (70/360) = 21.

Proceeds are 1800 -21= 1779. But that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me check the time calculation again. From March 31 to April 20 is 20 days? March 31 is day 1, so April 1 is day 2, up to April 20, which would be 20 days. So 20 days have passed, 70 days remaining.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the note's interest is calculated using the 365-day year instead of 360. That might change the outcome.

Wait, let's recalculate using 365 days. So 70/365 = approx 0.1918 years.

Discount = 1800 * 0.06 * (70/365) = 1800 * 0.06 * 0.1918.

0.06 * 0.1918 is about 0.011508. Multiply by 1800: 0.011508 * 1800 ≈ 20.7138, which is approximately $20.71.

So proceeds would be 1800 -20.71≈1779.29. Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the calculation expects using the exact number of days without the 360-day assumption.

Alternatively, maybe the interest is being calculated as simple interest, but the discounting is using a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is to compute the present value as face value / (1 + (rate * time)).

So, time is 70 days. If using a 360-day year, time is 70/360 = 7/36 ≈0.19444.

So, present value = 1800 / (1 + 0.06*(70/360)).

Calculate denominator: 1 + 0.06*(70/360) = 1 + (4.2/360)=1 +0.011666667=1.011666667.

So 1800 / 1.011666667 ≈ ?

Let me compute that. 1.011666667 is approximately 1.0116667.

So 1800 divided by 1.0116667.

Let me compute this step by step.

1.0116667 × 1779 = 1800?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 1800 / 1.0116667.

Let me approximate it.

1.0116667 is approximately 1 + 1/86.4. Wait, 0.0116667 is 1/86.4, because 1/86.4 is approximately 0.011574, which is close to 0.0116667.

Wait, maybe I can write it as 1.0116667 = 68/67?

Wait, 68/67 is approximately 1.014925, which is higher. Hmm, perhaps another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach:

Compute 1800 / 1.0116667.

Let me do it step by step.

1.0116667 = 1 + 0.0116667.

So 1800 / 1.0116667 ≈ 1800 * (1 -0.0116667) approximately, using the approximation that 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 -x for small x.

So 1800*(1 - 0.0116667) = 1800 - (1800 *0.0116667) = 1800 -21=1779, which brings me back to the same figure.

But the options don't have 1779. So perhaps the method is different.

Wait, perhaps the note is bearing interest, so the interest is already accrued. So the present value would be the face value minus the discount.

Alternatively, perhaps the discount is calculated differently. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula for the proceeds when discounting a note is:

Proceeds = Face Value - (Face Value × rate × time).

Which is what I did earlier. So 1800 - (1800 ×0.06×70/360)= 1800 -21=1779.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps I'm miscalculating the number of days.

Wait, perhaps the due date is June 29, which is exactly 90 days from March 31. So when the note is discounted on April 20, how many days have passed? Let's recount.

March has 31 days. So March 31 is the starting point. April 20 is 20 days later. So the time remaining is 90 -20 =70 days.

Wait, but perhaps the calculation uses a 365-day year. So 70 days is 70/365 of a year.

So discount is 1800 ×0.06×70/365.

Compute 70/365 = 0.1918.

0.06 ×0.1918=0.011508.

1800 ×0.011508= approx 20.713.

So proceeds are 1800 -20.713 ≈1779.287. Still not matching any options.

Looking at the options again, option E is $1775.32, which is close but not exact. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the exact day count, like actual days over 360 or 365.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the discount is calculated as (face value) × (rate) × (time in days)/360.

So, time is 70 days.

So, discount = 1800 × 0.06 ×70 / 360 = 1800 ×0.06 × (7/36).

Compute 0.06 ×7=0.42. 0.42 /36=0.0116667.

So 1800 ×0.0116667=21.

Proceeds: 1800-21=1779. Still same as before.

Wait, but perhaps the bank is using a different method, like using 365 days. So let's compute that.

70 days is 70/365 ≈0.1918 years.

Discount = 1800 ×0.06 ×0.1918≈20.7128.

Proceeds=1800-20.7128≈1779.287.

Still not matching any option. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the interest is being calculated on a 360-day basis, but the discount is based on the face value plus interest accrued. Hmm, or perhaps the note is a bearer note with interest, and the calculation includes the interest.

Wait, the note is dated March 31, and due June 29. So the interest for 90 days would be 1800 ×0.06 × (90/360)= 1800 ×0.015=27.

So the total amount due at maturity is 1800+27=1827. But that's at maturity.

But the bank is discounting it on April 20. So they would pay the present value of the future amount.

So the present value formula would be: PV = FV / (1 + r*t).

Where FV is 1827, r is 6%, and t is 70/360.

So t=70/360=0.194444.

So denominator: 1 + 0.06 *0.194444≈1 +0.0116666667=1.01166667.

So PV=1827 /1.01166667≈ let's compute that.

Compute 1827 × (1/1.01166667) ≈ ?

Well, 1.01166667 is approximately 1.0116667.

Let me compute 1827 divided by 1.0116667.

1.0116667 × 1805= approx 1827, because 1805 *1=1805, 1805 *0.0116667≈21. So 1805 +21=1826. Close enough.

So the present value is approximately 1805. So the proceeds are around $1805.

Looking at the options, option F is $1805.68. That's very close.

Wait, so perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Compute PV = 1827 / (1 + (0.06*(70/360))).

Calculate denominator: 1 + (0.06*(70/360)) = 1 + (4.2/360) = 1 + 0.011666667=1.011666667.

So 1827 /1.011666667.

Let me compute this division more precisely.

Compute 1827 ÷ 1.011666667.

Let me write it as 1827 ÷ (361/360) because 1.011666667 is 361/360.

Wait, 1.011666667 is 361/360? Let me check: 361/360 ≈1.0027778. No, that's not right.

Wait, 1.011666667 is equal to 1 + 70/(360*6) ? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute using decimals.

So 1827 ÷ 1.011666667 ≈ ?

Let me compute 1.011666667 × 1805 = ?

1.011666667 ×1800= 1819.99998, which is 1820. Then 1.011666667 ×5=5.0583333. So total 1820 +5.0583333=1825.0583333. Close to 1827.

So 1805 gives us 1825.0583. The difference is 1827 -1825.0583≈1.9417.

So to get the exact value, we can do 1805 + (1.9417 / 1.011666667).

1.9417 /1.011666667 ≈1.918.

So 1805 +1.918≈1806.918. Wait, that can't be right because that would make the present value higher, which doesn't make sense because the present value should be less than the future value.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps using a better method for division.

Alternatively, I can use the formula 1827 / 1.011666667.

Let me compute 1827 ÷1.011666667.

Let me write it as:

We can write 1827 ÷ 1.011666667 = 1827 × (1 / 1.011666667).

Compute 1 /1.011666667 ≈0.9881.

So 1827 ×0.9881.

Compute 1827 ×0.9881:

1827 ×0.9 = 1644.3

1827 ×0.08 =146.16

1827 ×0.0081≈14.80.

Adding them up: 1644.3 +146.16=1790.46 +14.80≈1805.26.

So approximately $1805.26.

Looking at the options, option F is $1805.68, which is very close. So perhaps the exact calculation gives 1805.68.

Wait, perhaps using more precise numbers.

Compute 1827 /1.011666667.

Let me do this division step by step.

1.011666667 × 1805 = ?

1.011666667 × 1800 = 1.011666667 ×1800 = 1800 ×1 + 1800 ×0.011666667.

1800 ×0.011666667 = 21.

So 1800 ×1.011666667=1821.

Now, 1.011666667 ×5=5.058333335.

So 1805 ×1.011666667=1821 +5.058333335=1826.0583333.

So 1805 gives 1826.0583. The target is 1827, so the difference is 1827-1826.0583≈0.9417.

So how much more do we need to add to 1805 to cover the remaining 0.9417?

Each 1 added to 1805 increases the product by 1.011666667.

So, 0.9417 /1.011666667 ≈0.931.

So total is 1805 +0.931≈1805.931.

So approximately 1805.93. Which is close to option F:1805.68.

Wait, but that's using the future value approach, which I think is the right way here. Because the bank is discounting the note, which means they're paying the present value of the total amount due at maturity.

Wait, but earlier I thought the discount was on the face value, but perhaps the correct approach is to discount the total amount
