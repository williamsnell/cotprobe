Question:

Citing specific investigations, discuss what the results of twin studieshave suggested about the role of heredity in the developmentof schizophrenia.

Options:

A: Identical twins have a lower concordance rate for schizophrenia than fraternal twins
B: Environmental factors are the sole determinants in the development of schizophrenia, with no genetic influence
C: The concordance rate for schizophrenia in fraternal twins is the same as in the general population
D: Schizophrenia is solely transmitted through genetic factors
E: The findings support the view that a predisposition for schizophrenia may exist and it is genetically transmitted
F: Schizophrenia is equally likely to develop in both twins, regardless of zygosity
G: Identical twins have a 100% concordance rate for schizophrenia
H: Identical twins raised apart have no higher concordance for schizophrenia than strangers
I: The concordance rate for schizophrenia in identical twins is the same as in non-twin siblings
J: Fraternal twins have a higher concordance rate for schizophrenia than identical twins

Okay, so I have this question about twin studies and schizophrenia. Hmm, I remember that twin studies are used to determine the influence of genetics versus environment in the development of traits or disorders. Schizophrenia is a mental disorder, and I think there's been a lot of research on whether it's genetic or not.

The question is asking about what the results of twin studies suggest regarding heredity's role in schizophrenia. The options are A to J, so I need to go through each one and see which makes sense based on what I know.

I remember that identical twins share more genes than fraternal twins. So if a disorder has a genetic component, identical twins should have a higher concordance rate. Concordance rate means the probability that both twins have the disorder if one does.

Option A says identical twins have lower concordance than fraternal. That doesn't make sense because identicals share more genes. So A is probably wrong.

Option B says environment is the only factor. I don't think that's right because most studies suggest some genetic component. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Fraternal twins have the same concordance as the general population. I'm not sure. If the general rate is say 1%, and fraternal twins have higher than that, then C would be wrong. But I'm not certain about the exact numbers.

Option D says schizophrenia is solely genetic. I don't think so; most disorders are polygenic and influenced by environment too. So D is wrong.

Option E: The findings support a genetic predisposition. That sounds familiar. Twin studies often show higher concordance in identical twins, indicating genetics play a role. So E might be the right choice.

Option F says it's equally likely regardless of zygosity. That can't be right because identicals have higher rates. So F is wrong.

Option G: 100% concordance in identical twins. No, I remember the rate is high but not 100%. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Identical twins raised apart have no higher concordance than strangers. That doesn't sound right. If genetics are a factor, even when raised apart, they should have higher rates than strangers. So H is wrong.

Option I: Concordance same as non-twin siblings. I think non-twin siblings have lower rates than identical twins, so I is incorrect.

Option J: Fraternal twins have higher than identical. That's the opposite of what I know, so J is wrong.

So putting it together, the correct answer must be E. The studies suggest a genetic predisposition exists, supporting the role of heredity in schizophrenia.

The results of twin studies on schizophrenia suggest that heredity plays a significant role in its development. Identical twins, who share nearly all their genes, have a higher concordance rate for schizophrenia compared to fraternal twins, who share only about 50% of their genes. This indicates a genetic predisposition. While environmental factors also influence the disorder, the higher concordance in identical twins supports the idea that genetics contribute to the risk. 

The correct answer is **E: The findings support the view that a predisposition for schizophrenia may exist and it is genetically transmitted.**

Answer: E
