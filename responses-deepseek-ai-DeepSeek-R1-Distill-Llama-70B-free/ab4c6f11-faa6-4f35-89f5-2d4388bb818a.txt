Question:

A well-known Washington newspaper columnist was researching the background of a lawyer who had been nominated to become attorney general of the United States and was awaiting confirmation by the U. S. Senate. One of the columnist's eager young apprentices concocted a plan that he hoped would enable him to gain the columnist's favor. Late one evening, without telling anyone, the apprentice broke into the lawyer's private office and copied several letters pertaining to "dirty tricks" perpetrated by the lawyer during the most recent presidential campaign. When the apprentice presented the columnist with the fruits of his diligent research, the columnist was quite impressed and immediately printed excerpts from the material. If the lawyer asserts a claim against the columnist for invasion of right to privacy, the plaintiff will most likely

Options:

A: prevail, because the information was obtained illegally.
B: prevail, because the publication was not newsworthy.
C: prevail, because the apprentice's action was an unlawful invasion of private facts.
D: prevail, because the apprentice acted on behalf of the columnist, making him liable.
E: not prevail, because the apprentice acted independently and without the knowledge or direction of the columnist.
F: not prevail, because the columnist was not involved in the burglary and did not conspire with the apprentice with respect to the burglary.
G: not prevail, because the information was of public interest and its publication served a greater public good.
H: not prevail, because the lawyer was a public figure and therefore his actions are subject to public scrutiny.
I: prevail, because the publication of private letters is an infringement on personal rights.
J: not prevail, because what the columnist printed was true, thus establishing there was no "false light. "

Okay, so I've got this question about privacy law, specifically invasion of privacy. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The scenario is about a Washington newspaper columnist who's researching a lawyer nominated for attorney general. The columnist's apprentice breaks into the lawyer's office, copies some letters about "dirty tricks" during the presidential campaign, and gives them to the columnist, who then publishes excerpts.

The question is whether the lawyer can successfully sue the columnist for invasion of privacy.

First, I need to recall what invasion of privacy entails. I think there are a few types, but the one that might apply here is the invasion of private facts or maybe the public disclosure of a matter concerning a private citizen that's highly offensive and not of public concern.

Wait, but the lawyer here is a public figure because he's nominated for a high government position, like attorney general. Public figures have a higher bar for privacy claims because they're in the public eye.

So, the key points are: the information was obtained illegally by the apprentice, but does that affect the columnist's liability? And is the information newsworthy or of public interest?

I remember that in some cases, even if information is obtained unlawfully, if it's of public concern, the First Amendment might protect the publisher. Like in the case where the Supreme Court held that the government can't punish the press for publishing information that was illegally obtained, as long as the press didn't participate in the illegal activity.

So, the columnist didn't break in; the apprentice did. But the apprentice is an employee. Wait, but the facts say the apprentice acted without telling anyone, so it's an independent action. So the columnist might not be liable for the apprentice's actions unless he was involved or directed it.

Wait, but the question is about invasion of privacy, not defamation. So the elements for invasion of privacy would be: a) a private fact, b) a matter of a private citizen that's highly offensive and c) not of public concern, or something along those lines.

But here, the lawyer is a public figure. Public figures can have a harder time winning privacy cases because the information is often considered newsworthy. The letters pertain to "dirty tricks" in a presidential campaign, which is definitely of public interest, especially since the lawyer is up for a significant public office.

So, even if the information was obtained illegally, if it's of public concern, the columnist might be protected. The Supreme Court case that comes to mind is Bartnicki v. Vopper, where the court held that the First Amendment protects the publication of illegally obtained information, provided the publisher wasn't involved in the illegal activity.

In this case, the apprentice did the burglary without the columnist's knowledge. So the columnist didn't participate in the illegal act. Therefore, the columnist can't be held liable for invasion of privacy because the information is of public interest, and the columnist didn't engage in the illegal conduct.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the plaintiff will prevail because the info was obtained illegally. But that's not necessarily the case because the columnist didn't obtain it illegally.

Option B says because the publication wasn't newsworthy. But the info is about a public figure and campaign conduct, so it's newsworthy.

Option C says because it's an unlawful invasion of private facts. But again, public figure and public interest matter.

Option D says the apprentice acted on behalf of the columnist, making him liable. But the question states the apprentice acted without telling anyone, so perhaps no agency here.

Option E says the plaintiff won't prevail because the apprentice acted independently. That could be a reason, but maybe not the strongest.

Option F says the columnist didn't participate in the burglary or conspire. That's more about the columnist's lack of involvement in the illegal act, which ties into the First Amendment protection.

Option G says it's of public interest and serves a greater good. That's a solid reason because the information is newsworthy.

Option H says the lawyer is a public figure. That goes to the higher standard for defamation, but also relevant for privacy because public figures have less expectation of privacy in matters of public interest.

Option I says it's an infringement on personal rights. But if the information is public concern, this might not hold.

Option J talks about truth being a defense, but that's more for defamation. The question is about privacy, not defamation, so J may not apply.

So the likely reasons are G and H. Which one is better?

The question is about invasion of privacy, so G is about public interest, H is about public figure status. Both are relevant, but I think the court would focus on whether the information is of public concern, which would make the columnist's publication protected.

Wait, but the specific claim is invasion of privacy. So in the case of a public figure, the information must be a matter of public concern to override privacy. 

In the Supreme Court case of Hustler Magazine v. Falwell, the court held that even offensive speech about public figures is protected unless it's made with actual malice (knowing falsity or reckless disregard). But that was about defamation, not privacy.

Wait, but for the privacy tort, the issue is whether the information is of public concern. If it is, then the First Amendment protects the publication, even if it was obtained unlawfully, as long as the publisher wasn't involved.

So, in this case, the letters concern the lawyer's actions in a presidential campaign, which is of public interest. So the columnist's publication is protected. Therefore, the lawyer wouldn't prevail.

Looking back at the options, G says the information is of public interest and serves a greater good. H says the lawyer is a public figure. Both could apply, but G is more about the content being newsworthy, which is the key factor.

So the correct answer would be G or H. But wait, let me think again. The Supreme Court in cases like The Florida Star v. B.J.F. held that the press cannot be held liable for public disclosure of a matter of public concern that was illegally obtained, as long as they didn't participate.

So the columnist is protected because the information is of public interest, making option G the correct choice.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option G says: not prevail, because the information was of public interest and its publication served a greater public good. That aligns with the reasoning.

Option H says not prevail because the lawyer is a public figure. That's also a valid point, but perhaps the better answer is G because it's about the content's newsworthiness.

Wait, but the Supreme Court has held that a public figure's privacy is outweighed by the public's interest in matters of public concern. So both G and H are correct, but which one is the primary reason.

In the case of a public figure, the privacy claim is more difficult because the information is about their public conduct. So perhaps H is the answer.

Wait, but in the case of The Florida Star, the person was a private figure, but the court still held that the information was of public concern, so the press was protected. So in this case, the lawyer is a public figure, which makes it even stronger for the columnist.

So, the lawyer as a public figure would have a harder time proving invasion of privacy because the information pertains to his public actions.

So, the correct answer is H: not prevail, because the lawyer was a public figure and subject to public scrutiny.

But wait, the question is about invasion of privacy, not defamation. In defamation, public figures need to show actual malice. For invasion of privacy, it's about whether the information is a matter of public concern, which can override privacy even for private figures.

So in this case, the information's newsworthiness is the key. So G would be the reason.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to outline:

Invasion of privacy (public disclosure of private facts) requires that the information be a matter of public concern. If it's not, then the privacy interest can prevail. But if it is, the First Amendment protects it.

Here, the information is about a lawyer nominated for a high office and his actions in a campaign. That's definitely a matter of public concern.

So the columnist can argue that the information's public interest outweighs the privacy rights, especially since the columnist didn't participate in the burglary.

Thus, the correct answer would be G: not prevail because the info was of public interest.

So I think the correct answer is G.

The question revolves around whether a lawyer, who is a public figure, can successfully sue a columnist for invasion of privacy after the columnist published excerpts from letters obtained illegally by an apprentice. The key issues are the legality of obtaining the information, the columnist's involvement, and whether the information is of public interest.

1. **Invasion of Privacy and Public Figures**: Public figures have a higher bar for privacy claims because their actions are often considered newsworthy and subject to public scrutiny. The lawyer, being nominated for attorney general, is a public figure, and the letters pertain to his actions in a presidential campaign, which is of public concern.

2. **Illegal Obtaining of Information**: While the apprentice acted unlawfully in obtaining the letters, the columnist did not participate in or condone the burglary. Under First Amendment protections, as seen in cases like *Bartnicki v. Vopper*, the press is generally protected from liability for publishing illegally obtained information if they did not participate in the unlawful act.

3. **Public Interest and Newsworthiness**: The letters concern "dirty tricks" in a political campaign, which is inherently newsworthy and of significant public interest. This newsworthiness outweighs the privacy concerns, especially when the individual is a public figure.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The information's illegal obtaining does not automatically make the columnist liable, as the columnist did not participate in the burglary.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. The publication is newsworthy given its relevance to the lawyer's public role.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The information is not merely private facts but matters of public concern.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. The apprentice acted independently, so the columnist is not liable for the apprentice's actions.
   - **Option E**: Incorrect. While the apprentice acted independently, the stronger reason for the columnist's protection is the public interest in the information.
   - **Option F**: Incorrect. The columnist's lack of involvement in the burglary is relevant, but the key issue is the information's public interest.
   - **Option G**: Correct. The information is of public interest, and its publication serves a greater public good, overriding privacy concerns.
   - **Option H**: Plausible but secondary. While the lawyer being a public figure is relevant, the stronger reason is the information's newsworthiness.
   - **Option I**: Incorrect. The publication does not infringe personal rights when the information is of public concern.
   - **Option J**: Incorrect. This pertains to defamation, not invasion of privacy.

The correct answer is **G**, as the information's public interest and newsworthiness are the primary reasons the columnist is protected. 

Answer: G
