Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about a ball being released from rest, so it starts with zero initial velocity. I'm supposed to find its velocity after it falls a certain distance, which is 256 feet. The options are given from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that when an object is dropped, its motion is influenced by gravity. Since we're probably dealing with constant acceleration here, I think I should use the kinematic equations. Oh wait, right, the equation that relates distance, initial velocity, acceleration, and time. But wait, I don't have time here; I just have the distance fallen. So maybe another equation would be better.

Wait, the correct approach is probably to use the equation that doesn't involve time. Let me think. Oh right, the equation is v² = u² + 2as. Yeah, that's the one. Since the initial velocity u is zero (because it's released from rest), that simplifies the equation a lot.

So plugging in the values, u is 0, a is the acceleration due to gravity. But wait, what's the value of g here? I'm in feet units, right? Because the distance is in feet, 256 ft. So I think in the Imperial system, g is approximately 32 ft/s². Oh yeah, I remember that. So a = 32 ft/s².

So substituting into the equation: v² = 0 + 2 * 32 ft/s² * 256 ft. Let me compute that. 2 times 32 is 64, and 64 times 256. Hmm, what's 64 * 256? Let me calculate that. Wait, 64 * 200 is 12,800, and 64 * 56 is 3,584. So adding them together gives 12,800 + 3,584 = 16,384. So v squared is 16,384.

Taking the square root of 16,384. Let me see, I think 128 squared is 16,384 because 128 * 128. Let me check: 100*100 is 10,000, 28*100 is 2,800, 100*28 is another 2,800, and 28*28 is 784. So adding 10,000 + 2,800 + 2,800 + 784 gives 16,384. Yes, that's right. So v is 128 ft/s.

Looking at the options, E is 128 ft/sec. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but let me double-check that I used the right formula. Could there be another approach? Maybe using the equation v = u + at. But since u is zero, v = at. But then I would need the time it takes to fall 256 feet. However, that would require using another equation to find time first. Like s = ut + 0.5 a t². Since u is zero, s = 0.5 * a * t². Then t would be sqrt(2s/a). But that seems more complicated than the first method, which gave me a direct answer. So I think the first approach is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute using that method to confirm. So s = 256 ft, a=32. So s = 0.5 * a * t² → 256 = 16 t² → t² = 16 → t=4 seconds. Then v = a t = 32 *4 = 128 ft/s. Oh, same result. So definitely, the answer is E.

To determine the velocity of the ball after falling 256 feet, we use the kinematic equation:

\[
v^2 = u^2 + 2as
\]

Here:
- \( u = 0 \) (initial velocity, as the ball is released from rest),
- \( a = 32 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \) (acceleration due to gravity),
- \( s = 256 \, \text{ft} \) (distance fallen).

Substituting the values:

\[
v^2 = 0 + 2(32)(256)
\]

\[
v^2 = 64 \times 256 = 16,384
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v = \sqrt{16,384} = 128 \, \text{ft/s}.
\]

Thus, the velocity of the ball after falling 256 feet is **128 ft/sec**, which corresponds to option **E**.
