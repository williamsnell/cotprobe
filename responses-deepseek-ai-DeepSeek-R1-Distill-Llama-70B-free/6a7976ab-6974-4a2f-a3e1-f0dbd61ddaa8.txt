Okay, so I have this induction motor problem to solve. Hmm, let me try to remember what I know about induction motors. Alright, the question says that the rotor current per phase is 10 amperes, and the slip is 5 percent. The rotor's effective resistance is 0.1 ohms per phase. I need to find the internal power developed per phase.

Wait, internal power... Oh right, in induction motors, the internal power, sometimes called the rotor power, is related to the slip. I think the formula might involve the square of the slip multiplied by something. Oh wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Let me think. The power in the rotor is usually split into two parts: the power that's converted into mechanical power (the useful part) and the power that's lost as heat in the rotor windings. The total rotor power would be the sum of these two. But wait, the question is asking for the internal power developed, which I believe refers to the mechanical power plus the rotor copper losses. Or wait, no, maybe it's just the power that's actually going into doing work, not counting the losses...

Wait, I should clarify. The total power on the rotor side is called the "rotor input power." This is equal to the rotor current squared multiplied by (R2 / s), where R2 is the rotor resistance and s is the slip. But wait, no, that's the rotor copper loss. Or is it?

Wait a minute, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try to structure this. The rotor current is I2, which is given as 10 A. The slip s is 5%, which is 0.05. The rotor resistance R2 is 0.1 ohms.

So, the power developed per phase, which I think is the mechanical power plus the losses, would be calculated using the formula: P = I2² * (R2 / s). Wait, no, that's the rotor copper loss. Because the copper loss is I² R. But when the motor is running, some of this loss is dissipated as heat, and the rest contributes to the mechanical power. Or wait, maybe the power transferred is I² R2 / s, but the copper loss is I² R2. So the mechanical power would be (I² R2 / s) - (I² R2) which is I² R2 (1/s - 1). But wait, that can't be right because when s is small, like in normal operation, 1/s is much larger than 1, so the mechanical power would be positive. But in this problem, the question is about the internal power developed per phase. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. In an induction motor, the power developed (P_mech) is given by the rotor current squared multiplied by (R2 / s) minus the rotor copper loss. So P_mech = (I2^2 * R2/s) - I2^2 R2. So factoring that, it's I2^2 R2 (1/s - 1). But wait, maybe the question is asking for the total power on the rotor side, which would include both the mechanical power and the copper loss. So that would be I² R2 / s. Because the rotor input power is I² (R2 / s). Wait, no, I think the rotor input power (the power entering the rotor circuit) is the sum of the mechanical power and the rotor copper loss. So that's P_rotor_input = I2^2 * (R2 / s). But that would be higher than the copper loss. Because (R2 / s) is bigger than R2 when s is less than 1. So yes, P_rotor_input would be I² R2 / s, which includes both the mechanical power and the copper loss. So the internal power developed would be that P_rotor_input, which would be the power converted into mechanical work plus the losses as heat.

Wait, wait, but the question is phrased as "internal power developed per phase." Hmm, maybe that refers to the mechanical power, which would be P_mech = (I2^2 R2) ( (1 - s)/s ). Because the copper loss is I² R2, and the rest is mechanical. So P_mech = (I² R2/s) - I² R2 = I² R2 (1/s - 1). So 1/s is 20, because s is 0.05. So 20 - 1 is 19. So I² R2 * 19. 

Wait, let's compute that. I2 is 10 A, R2 is 0.1 ohms. So 10^2 is 100. 100 * 0.1 is 10. Multiply by 19 gives 190. So 190 watts. But looking at the options, G is 190 watts. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me think again to make sure I'm not mixing up the terms. The internal power developed could be the mechanical power output. Or is it the total power? Hmm. Alternatively, I recall that the power developed in the rotor is P = I2² R2 / s. But that would be 10^2 * 0.1 / 0.05. Let's compute that: 100 * 0.1 is 10, divided by 0.05 is 200. So 200 watts, which is option D. But wait, that's just the rotor input power, which includes both the mechanical power and the copper loss. So the internal power developed would be that, but then the options have 200 as D, 190 as G.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me look it up in my notes. Oh wait, I can't. So let me think again.

The rotor's induced current causes two things: the current times voltage (which is I R2 s, because V = I R, but wait no, the voltage is actually proportional to slip... Maybe I should think in terms of power.

Alternatively, the rotor power can be considered as the product of the rotor current and the rotor-induced voltage. The induced voltage per phase in the rotor is E2 = I2 * (R2 / s). So the power would be E2 * I2 = I2² (R2 / s). That's 10^2 * 0.1 / 0.05 = 100 * 2 = 200 W. So that would be option D: 200 watts.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the mechanical power is 190, but that's when I subtract the copper loss. So which one is the internal power developed? Hmm.

Wait, the question says "internal power developed per phase." In induction motor terminology, the "power developed" in the rotor is usually considered as the power that is converted into mechanical power plus the copper losses. So that would be the rotor input power, which is I² R2 / s.

So in this case, 10^2 * 0.1 / 0.05 = 100 * 0.1 is 10, divided by 0.05 is 200. So 200 watts, option D.

But wait, another approach: the power transferred to the rotor is equal to the mechanical power plus the rotor copper loss. So the internal power developed would be the mechanical power, which is P = (I2^2 R2) * (1 - s)/s. So 100 * 0.1 is 10. Multiply by (1 - 0.05)/0.05 = 0.95 / 0.05 = 19. So 10 * 19 = 190. That would be option G.

So now I'm getting two different answers depending on what's being asked. The question is about the internal power developed per phase. Hmm. I think "internal power developed" refers to the mechanical power, not including the copper loss, because the copper loss is just lost as heat and not useful power. So that would make it 190 watts, option G.

Alternatively, sometimes the term "power developed" can include both, but I'm a bit unsure. Wait, looking back, I recall that the power developed in the rotor is the sum of the mechanical power and the rotor copper loss. So P_rotor_developed = I² (R2 / s). So that's 200 watts. But the rotor copper loss is I² R2, which is 10 amps squared times 0.1 ohms, so 10^2 * 0.1 = 10 watts. So the mechanical power would be 200 - 10 = 190 watts. So the question is, what's being asked here.

The question says, "internal power developed per phase." Hmm, maybe that refers to the mechanical power, which would be 190 watts. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, the term "internal power developed" might refer to the total power in the rotor, which is 200 watts. The options have both 190 and 200 as possibilities.

Wait, let me think of the formula again. The power developed by the rotor is P = s * (Rotor input power). Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Another way: Rotor input power is (1 - s) times the stator input power, but that's getting into more complicated territory.

Another approach: the torque developed in the rotor is related to the current and slip. But perhaps that's more mechanical.

Wait, in an induction motor, the rotor current causes a certain power to be developed. The formula for the power developed in the rotor is P = (I2^2 * R2) / s. This is the power that's available in the rotor, some of which goes into mechanical power and some into heat. So the internal power developed per phase would be this P, which is 200 watts, option D.

But earlier, I thought that the mechanical power is 190. So I'm torn between the two.

Wait, perhaps I should check the standard formula. The power developed in the rotor is P = I2² (R2 / s). This P is the sum of the mechanical power and the copper losses. So if the question is asking for the internal power developed, that would be 200 W, option D.

But then, some sources say that the power developed is the mechanical power, which would be P = (I2^2 R2 (1 - s)) / s. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about units. Rotor resistance is 0.1 ohms, current is 10 A. The copper loss is I² R = 100 * 0.1 = 10 W. So if s is 5%, the rotor input power is I² R2/s = 100 * 0.1 / 0.05 = 200 W. So 200 W is the power supplied to the rotor, of which 10 W is lost as heat, and the remaining 190 W is the mechanical power. So the question is, what is the "internal power developed"? If it's the power that the rotor actually converts into something (including heat), then it's 200 W. If it's the useful mechanical power, then it's 190 W.

The question says "internal power developed per phase." I think in this context, the internal power developed refers to the mechanical power output, which would be 190 W. So the answer would be G.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Another way to look at it: the "power developed" in the rotor is the power that does work, which would exclude the copper losses. So that would make it 190 W, option G.

So after all this thinking, I'm leaning towards option G: 190 watts.

To determine the internal power developed per phase in the induction motor, we analyze the given data:

- **Rotor current per phase**: \( I_2 = 10 \, \text{A} \)
- **Slip**: \( s = 5\% = 0.05 \)
- **Rotor resistance per phase**: \( R_2 = 0.1 \, \Omega \)

The internal power developed per phase can be interpreted in two ways:

1. **Rotor input power**: This is the total power supplied to the rotor, which includes both the mechanical power and the rotor copper losses. It is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   P_{\text{rotor input}} = \frac{I_2^2 R_2}{s}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   P_{\text{rotor input}} = \frac{10^2 \cdot 0.1}{0.05} = \frac{100 \cdot 0.1}{0.05} = 200 \, \text{W}
   \]

2. **Mechanical power**: This is the useful power developed by the rotor, excluding the rotor copper losses. The rotor copper losses are given by:
   \[
   P_{\text{copper loss}} = I_2^2 R_2 = 10^2 \cdot 0.1 = 10 \, \text{W}
   \]
   The mechanical power is then:
   \[
   P_{\text{mechanical}} = P_{\text{rotor input}} - P_{\text{copper loss}} = 200 - 10 = 190 \, \text{W}
   \]

The question asks for the "internal power developed per phase." Based on the context, this likely refers to the **mechanical power**, which is the useful power output of the rotor. Therefore, the internal power developed per phase is:

**190 W**

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**G: 190 watts**
