Okay, I'm trying to solve this combustion problem about propane. Hmm, let's see. So the question is about burning propane in excess air, and I need to find the dew point temperature and the moles of water condensed when the products are cooled to 25°C. 

First, I remember that the dew point is the temperature at which water vapor starts to condense. So I need to find the point where the water in the combustion products reaches its dew point when cooling.

Propane is C3H8. The combustion reaction for propane in air is something like C3H8 + 5O2 → 3CO2 + 4H2O. But wait, since it's burned in excess air, there's more O2 than needed, so I have to account for that.

The problem says 100% excess air. Wait, excess air is the amount beyond the stoichiometric requirement. So stoichiometric air is the exact amount needed for complete combustion. So 100% excess means the air is double the stoichiometric amount. Because if stoichiometric is 100%, then 100% excess would make it 200% of the stoichiometric air.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Excess air is usually the percentage beyond stoichiometric. So stoichiometric is 100%, and excess is, say, 100% of that. So the total air supplied is stoichiometric + excess. So 100% excess would mean total air is 200% of stoichiometric. So yes, total air is twice the stoichiometric.

So first, I need to write the combustion equation with excess air.

The stoichiometric equation for propane is:

C3H8 + 5O2 → 3CO2 + 4H2O

But since there's excess air, O2 is in excess. Let me find the stoichiometric amount of air. Air is approximately 21% O2 by volume, so 1 mole of O2 is about 4.76 moles of air (since 1/0.21 ≈ 4.76). Wait, but in combustion calculations, sometimes we use 4.76 as the multiplication factor for moles of air per mole of O2.

So for stoichiometric combustion, each mole of propane requires 5 moles of O2, which comes from 5 * 4.76 ≈ 23.8 moles of air. But since the excess is 100%, the total air is 2 * 23.8 ≈ 47.6 moles of air per mole of propane.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to model the combustion equation with excess air. Let me write the combustion equation with excess air.

Let me define the stoichiometric air first. For C3H8, the stoichiometric air is calculated based on the O2 needed. The balanced equation is C3H8 + 5O2 → 3CO2 +4H2O. So for each mole of propane, we need 5 moles O2. Since air is 21% O2, the amount of air (in moles) needed is (5 / 0.21) ≈ 23.81 moles.

With 100% excess air, the total air supplied is 2 * 23.81 ≈ 47.62 moles.

So the combustion equation with excess air would be:

C3H8 + (5 + 5) O2 + N2 → products.

Wait, no, I think I should balance the equation properly. Let's think in terms of moles.

So for 1 mole of C3H8:

Required O2: 5 moles.

Excess O2 is 100% of required, so excess O2 is 5 moles. So total O2 supplied is 10 moles.

But wait, that's not quite right. Because excess air is the amount beyond stoichiometric. So for stoichiometric, O2 is 5 moles. 100% excess means O2 is 5 + 5 =10 moles.

So the equation becomes:

C3H8 + 10 O2 → 3CO2 +4 H2O + (O2 remaining).

Wait, but I also need to account for the nitrogen in the air. Since air is approx 79% N2, for each mole of O2, there's 3.76 moles of N2.

So stoichiometric air is 23.81 moles (as before), which contains 5 moles O2 and 23.81 -5 = 18.81 moles N2.

With 100% excess air, the air is 47.62 moles, so O2 is 10 moles, N2 is 47.62 -10=37.62 moles.

So the combustion equation becomes:

C3H8 + 10 O2 + 37.62 N2 → 3CO2 +4 H2O + (O2 remaining) + 37.62 N2.

Because N2 is inert under standard conditions.

Now, let's balance the equation. 

Combustion of C3H8:

C: 3 → 3CO2, so that's balanced.

H: 8 → 4 H2O, so that's balanced.

O: On the reactant side, 10 O2 → 20 O atoms.

On product side: 3CO2 has 6 O, 4 H2O has 4 O, so total O is 10. So 20 O from O2 must go to CO2 and H2O, but wait, 3CO2 is 6 O, 4 H2O is 4 O, total 10 O. So the O2 supplied is 10 moles → 20 O atoms. The products have 10 O2 worth (20 O), so the rest of O2 remains as excess.

Wait, no. Let me see:

Wait, the products from C3H8 are 3CO2 and 4 H2O, which require 5 moles of O2.

But we have 10 moles O2 supplied, so the excess is 5 moles O2.

So the products are:

3CO2 +4 H2O +5 O2 +37.62 N2.

Wait, no. Because 10 moles O2 is used as 5 moles for combustion, but wait, no. Wait, the stoichiometric O2 is 5 moles needed. So with 10 moles supplied, 5 moles are excess, so they remain as O2 in the products.

So the product moles are:

CO2:3, H2O:4, O2:5, N2:37.62.

So in total, the moles after combustion are:

3 +4 +5 +37.62 = 49.62 moles.

Wait, but let me recount:

C3H8: 1 mole.

O2 supplied:10 moles.

N2:37.62.

Products: 3CO2, 4H2O, 5O2, 37.62 N2.

So total moles of products: 3+4+5+37.62 = 49.62.

But wait, the N2 is inert, so it just passes through. So the total moles of products are 3 CO2 +4 H2O +5 O2 +37.62 N2.

Now, to find the dew point temperature, which is the temperature at which water vapor starts to condense. So the dew point is when the partial pressure of H2O equals the saturation pressure at that temperature.

So first, I need to find the partial pressure of H2O in the product mixture.

The partial pressure of H2O is (moles H2O / total moles) * total pressure.

Total pressure is 100 kPa.

Moles H2O is 4.

Total moles is 49.62.

So partial pressure P_H2O = (4 / 49.62) * 100 kPa ≈ (0.0806) *100 ≈8.06 kPa.

Wait, let me compute that accurately.

4 /49.62 = 0.0806 approximately.

So P_H2O ≈8.06 kPa.

Now, I need to find the dew point temperature corresponding to this partial pressure. 

I remember that the saturation pressure of water at a given temperature can be found using steam tables or the Antoine equation.

The Antoine equation for water is:

log10(P) = 8.14019 - (1810.94 / (T + 244.485)) 

Where P is in mmHg and T is in °C.

Wait, but wait, I think I should confirm the correct Antoine coefficients. Alternatively, I can use the steam tables to find the temperature where the saturation pressure is approximately 8.06 kPa.

Wait, 8.06 kPa is about 8.06 kPa. Let me convert that to mmHg to use the Antoine equation. 1 kPa is approximately 7.5006 mmHg, so 8.06 *7.5006≈ 60.48 mmHg.

So I can plug into the Antoine equation:

log10(P) = 8.14019 - (1810.94 / (T + 244.485))

We have P =60.48 mmHg.

So log10(60.48) ≈ 1.7818.

1.7818 = 8.14019 - (1810.94)/(T+244.485)

Rearranging:

(1810.94)/(T+244.485) = 8.14019 -1.7818 =6.35839

So T +244.485 = 1810.94 /6.35839 ≈ 284.8 K.

Wait, 1810.94 divided by 6.35839 is approximately 284.8 K? Let me compute:

6.35839 × 284 = approx 6.358 *284 = ?

Wait, 6 *284=1704, 0.358*284≈101.7, total ≈1805.7. Close to 1810. So 284.8 K is about 11.65°C.

Wait, that can't be right because the options are in the 35-55°C range. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check. The Antoine equation I used earlier is valid from 1 to 100°C. Let me confirm the correct coefficients.

Wait, Antoine equation for water in the range of 1 to 374°C is:

log10(P) = 8.14019 − (1810.94)/(T + 244.485)

But P is in mmHg, and T is in Celsius.

Wait, so if I have P in kPa, I need to convert it to mmHg. 8.06 kPa is 8.06 * 760 mmHg/kPa = 8.06 *760 ≈ 6130 mmHg? Wait, wait, no. Wait, 1 kPa is 10^3 Pa, 1 mmHg is 133.322 Pa. So 1 kPa is 7.5006 mmHg.

So 8.06 kPa *7.5006 ≈ 60.48 mmHg. So that part is correct.

So with P=60.48 mmHg:

log10(60.48)=1.7818.

Set equal to the equation:

1.7818 =8.14019 − (1810.94)/(T+244.485)

So:

(1810.94)/(T+244.485) = 8.14019 -1.7818 → 6.35839.

So T +244.485 = 1810.94 /6.35839 → 1810.94 /6.35839 ≈ 284.8 K.

Wait, 284.8 K is 11.66°C. But the options given are higher, like 38°C, 41.5°C, etc. So I must have an error here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the partial pressure of H2O. Let me recheck that.

The moles of H2O is 4. Total moles of products is 3 (CO2) +4 (H2O) +5 (O2) +37.62 (N2) → sum is 3+4=7, 7+5=12, 12+37.62=49.62. So total moles is 49.62.

So mole fraction of H2O is 4/49.62 ≈0.0806.

Total pressure is 100 kPa, so P_H2O=0.0806 *100=8.06 kPa.

Hmm, that seems correct.

Wait, maybe I used the wrong Antoine equation. Let me check another source or maybe use the steam tables.

Alternatively, using the ideal gas-based approach, the dew point is where the partial pressure of H2O equals the saturation pressure at that temperature.

Looking at steam tables, I can find the temperature where P_sat is approximately 8.06 kPa.

Let me think: At 45°C, the saturation pressure is about 71.88 mmHg, which is about 9.57 kPa. Wait, because 1 mmHg is 0.1333 kPa, so 71.88 *0.1333 ≈9.57 kPa.

Wait, but our P_H2O is 8.06 kPa, which is less than 9.57 kPa. So the dew point would be lower than 45°C.

Looking for 8 kPa, which is 60 mmHg. Let me check the saturation temperature at 60 mmHg.

Looking up steam tables, the saturation temperature for 60 mmHg is approximately 49°C. Wait, let me confirm:

From steam tables, at 49°C, the saturation pressure is about 81.5 mmHg. Hmm, that's higher than 60. So I'm looking for a lower temperature.

Wait, perhaps I should interpolate. Let me think of the data points.

At 40°C, P_sat is 55.32 mmHg (approx 7.39 kPa).

At 45°C, 71.88 mmHg (approx 9.57 kPa).

Wait, so at 40°C, P_sat ≈7.39 kPa (55.32 mmHg). Our P_H2O is 8.06 kPa, which is higher than 7.39, so temperature is between 40 and 45°C.

Let me find the exact temperature using linear interpolation.

The difference in pressure between 40 and 45°C is 71.88 -55.32 =16.56 mmHg, which is 2.20 kPa.

We need to find the temperature T where P_sat = 60 mmHg (8.06 kPa).

Wait, 60 mmHg is 8.06 kPa. So between 40 and 45°C, P_sat increases from 55.32 mmHg (7.39 kPa) to 71.88 mmHg (9.57 kPa). 

So the target P is 60 mmHg, which is 4.68 mmHg above 55.32. The range is 16.56 mmHg per 5°C. So 4.68 /16.56 ≈0.2826 of 5°C, which is about 1.41°C above 40°C. So T ≈41.41°C.

So the dew point temperature is approximately 41.4°C. Looking at the options, option E is 41.53°C, which is very close.

So part (a) is about 41.5°C.

Now, part (b) is the moles of H2O condensed per mole of fuel when cooled to 25°C.

Wait, when the products are cooled to 25°C, some of the water vapor will condense. The amount that condenses depends on how much can be present as vapor at 25°C.

At 25°C, the saturation pressure is lower. So the partial pressure of H2O in the products at 25°C can't exceed the saturation pressure at that temperature.

So first, what's the saturation pressure of H2O at 25°C? I think it's about 3.169 kPa, because from steam tables, at 25°C, P_sat is 23.8 mmHg, which is 23.8 *0.1333 ≈3.17 kPa.

So the maximum partial pressure of H2O at 25°C without condensation is 3.17 kPa.

But in the product gas, the partial pressure before cooling is 8.06 kPa. So when cooled, the partial pressure can't exceed 3.17 kPa. The excess will condense.

So the moles of H2O remaining in the gas phase after cooling is (3.17 kPa /100 kPa) * total moles.

Wait, but wait, the total pressure is 100 kPa. So after cooling, the partial pressure of H2O can't exceed 3.17 kPa. So the mole fraction of H2O in the gas would be 3.17 /100 =0.0317.

So moles of H2O remaining in gas is 0.0317 * total moles after cooling.

Wait, but when we cool the gas, the total moles don't change because the O2, N2, and CO2 are still there; only H2O is condensing into liquid, reducing the moles of gas.

Wait, this part I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The initial total moles after combustion (before cooling) are 49.62.

When cooling to 25°C, some H2O condenses. Let me denote the moles of H2O remaining in gas as y.

So the partial pressure of H2O is y/(total moles) *100 kPa ≤3.17 kPa.

Wait, but when H2O condenses, the total moles of gas decrease because H2O is being removed as liquid. So I think the approach is to calculate the maximum moles of H2O that can remain in the gas without condensation.

So the maximum y is determined by y = (P_sat at 25°C / P_total) * (total gas moles - y_condensed). Hmm, maybe a better approach is as follows.

The partial pressure of H2O after cooling is P_H2O = y * R T / V, but since pressure is constant at 100 kPa, perhaps it's better to think in terms of mole fractions.

Alternatively, after cooling, the mole fraction of H2O can't exceed (P_sat / P_total). So:

y = (P_sat / P_total) * (total moles after cooling).

Wait, but total moles after cooling would be initial total moles minus moles of H2O that condensed.

Wait, perhaps a better way
