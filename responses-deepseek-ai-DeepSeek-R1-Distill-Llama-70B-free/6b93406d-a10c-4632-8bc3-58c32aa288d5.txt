Okay, so I've got this question about a Van de Graaff generator, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but let's see if I can figure it out. The question is asking for the minimum radius the spherical shell can have when it's charged to a potential of 10^6 V. The dielectric strength of air is given as 3 × 10^6 V/m. Hmm, I remember that the dielectric strength is the maximum electric field a material can handle without breaking down, right?

Wait, the Van de Graaff generator stores charge on a spherical shell. I think the electric field just outside the shell is what's important here. Oh right, for a conducting sphere, the electric field at the surface is E = V/r, where V is the potential and r is the radius. And this E shouldn't exceed the dielectric strength of the surrounding medium, which in this case is air.

So the dielectric strength (E_max) is 3e6 V/m. The potential V is 1e6 V. So I can set up the equation E = V/r. But wait, since the electric field can't exceed E_max, the maximum E is E_max. So V/r should be equal to E_max for the minimum radius, because if the radius is smaller, E would be larger than E_max, causing breakdown. So solving for r gives r = V/E_max.

Let me plug in the numbers: V is 1e6 V, E_max is 3e6 V/m. So r = (1e6) / (3e6) = 1/3 meters. Oh wait, 1/3 of a meter is approximately 0.333 meters. Wait, but let me double-check the formula. Yes, E = V/r for a sphere, correct. So yeah, r = V/E_max.

Looking at the options, option B is 1/3 m, which matches this calculation. So the minimum radius to prevent the electric field from exceeding air's dielectric strength is 1/3 meters.

To determine the minimum radius of the spherical shell of a Van de Graaff generator, we use the relationship between electric field, potential, and radius for a conducting sphere. The electric field at the surface of the sphere is given by:

\[
E = \frac{V}{r}
\]

Here, \( V = 10^6 \, \text{V} \) is the potential, and \( r \) is the radius of the shell. The dielectric strength of air is \( E_{\text{max}} = 3 \times 10^6 \, \text{V/m} \), which represents the maximum electric field air can withstand without breakdown. To ensure the electric field does not exceed this value, we set \( E = E_{\text{max}} \), giving:

\[
r = \frac{V}{E_{\text{max}}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
r = \frac{10^6}{3 \times 10^6} = \frac{1}{3} \, \text{m}
\]

Thus, the minimum radius of the shell is \( \frac{1}{3} \, \text{m} \). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

B: \( \frac{1}{3} \, \text{m} \).
