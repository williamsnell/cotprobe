Okay, so I have this question about whether the polynomial 4x - 2 is irreducible over the integers (Z) and over the rationals (Q). Hmm, I remember that irreducibility means the polynomial can't be factored into the product of two non-constant polynomials in the given ring. Let me think step by step.

First, Statement 1 says 4x - 2 is irreducible over Z. Well, wait, 4x - 2 is a linear polynomial, right? Because the highest power of x is 1. And I think linear polynomials are always irreducible because you can't factor them any further. They can't be broken down into lower-degree polynomials with integer coefficients. So over Z, 4x - 2 should be irreducible. So Statement 1 is true.

Now, Statement 2 is about reducibility over Q, the rationals. But wait, if a polynomial is irreducible over Z, does that mean it's irreducible over Q? Or is the other way around? Let me get this straight. Since Z is a subset of Q, if a polynomial is reducible over Q, it doesn't necessarily mean it's reducible over Z. But for linear polynomials, like 4x - 2, they can't be factored further regardless of the field. So over Q, 4x - 2 is still a linear polynomial and thus irreducible. So Statement 2 should also be true.

Wait, but maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. Oh wait, no. Wait, 4x - 2 could be considered as 2*(2x - 1) in Z, but 2 is a unit in Q? Or wait, no, in Q, constants are units. So in Q[x], the polynomial 4x - 2 can be factored as 2*(2x - 1). But wait, wait, but does that count? Because 2 is a unit in Q. Oh right, in Q[x], you can factor out a unit. But wait, when considering irreducibility, we usually factor into non-unit factors. Since 2 is a unit in Q (because 1/2 is in Q), then 4x -2 can be written as 2*(2x-1), but 2 is a unit, so the only non-unit factor is (2x-1), which is degree 1. So the polynomial is still irreducible over Q because you can't factor it into lower-degree polynomials without involving a unit.

Wait, no, another angle: in Q[x], the concept is that a polynomial is irreducible if it cannot be written as the product of two non-constant polynomials with coefficients in Q. So 4x-2 is degree 1, so cannot be broken down further. So over Q, it's irreducible. So Statement 2 is also true.

Wait, but earlier I thought that maybe it can be factored into 2*(2x-1), but since 2 is a unit, that doesn't count as a non-trivial factorization. So both statements being true.

Wait, but then the options: Option G is True, True. But the options are from A to J. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options:

Option G: True, True.

So the correct answer should be G.

Wait, but wait, another thought. Wait, over Z, 4x-2 is linear, so irreducible. Over Q, same thing. So both statements are true. So the answer would be G.

But wait, wait! Another angle: in Z[x], can 4x-2 be considered reducible? Because maybe you can factor it as 2*(2x - 1), but 2 is not a unit in Z. So in Z[x], 2 is a non-unit, so if 4x-2 factors into 2*(2x-1), then it's reducible over Z. Oh wait wait! Wait a second, that's a big mistake.

Wait, wait, in Z[x], 4x-2 can be factored as 2*(2x - 1). Both 2 and (2x-1) are in Z[x]. So 4x-2 is reducible over Z, because it's the product of 2 (a non-unit, since in Z, units are 1 and -1) and (2x-1). So that means Statement 1 is false, because it is reducible over Z.

Wait, but earlier I thought that linear polynomials are irreducible over any field. But wait, 4x-2 is linear, but over Z, it's not a field, it's a ring. So maybe the rules are different.

Wait, let me clarify. In a field, a linear polynomial is always irreducible because it cannot be factored into lower-degree polynomials. But in a ring like Z, the situation is different because you can have zero divisors or factors that are not units.

So in Z[x], 4x-2 can be factored into 2*(2x-1), which are both non-constant polynomials in Z[x]. Therefore, 4x-2 is reducible over Z. So Statement 1 is false.

Wait, but I thought that in Z[x], a linear polynomial couldn't be factored. But perhaps that's only when the leading coefficient is 1 or -1. Because if the coefficient isn't a unit, maybe you can factor out a non-unit constant.

So 4x-2 is degree 1, but has a leading coefficient of 4. So in Z[x], 4x-2 is reducible because it can be written as 2*(2x-1). So Statement 1 is false.

Then, Statement 2: over Q, 4x-2 is linear, so irreducible. Because in Q[x], any linear polynomial is irreducible. So Statement 2 is true.

So Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true. So the options: looking for False, True.

Looking at the options, option F is False, True.

Wait, but let me make sure. Wait, in Q[x], 4x-2 can be written as 2*(2x-1). But 2 is a unit in Q[x], so that doesn't make the polynomial reducible. So 4x-2 is irreducible in Q[x], yes.

So Statements: 1 is false, 2 is true.

So the correct answer would be option F.

To determine the irreducibility of the polynomial \(4x - 2\) over \(\mathbb{Z}\) and \(\mathbb{Q}\), we analyze each statement:

1. **Statement 1: \(4x - 2\) is irreducible over \(\mathbb{Z}\).**  
   In \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\), a polynomial is reducible if it can be factored into the product of two non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients. The polynomial \(4x - 2\) can be factored as \(2(2x - 1)\), where both \(2\) and \(2x - 1\) are non-constant polynomials in \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\). Since \(2\) is not a unit in \(\mathbb{Z}\), this factorization shows that \(4x - 2\) is reducible over \(\mathbb{Z}\). Therefore, **Statement 1 is false**.

2. **Statement 2: \(4x - 2\) is irreducible over \(\mathbb{Q}\).**  
   In \(\mathbb{Q}[x]\), a polynomial is irreducible if it cannot be factored into the product of two non-constant polynomials with rational coefficients. Although \(4x - 2\) can be written as \(2(2x - 1)\) in \(\mathbb{Q}[x]\), the factor \(2\) is a unit in \(\mathbb{Q}\) (since \(2^{-1} = \frac{1}{2}\) is in \(\mathbb{Q}\)). Thus, this factorization does not count as a non-trivial factorization, and \(4x - 2\) remains irreducible over \(\mathbb{Q}\). Therefore, **Statement 2 is true**.

Given this analysis, the correct answer is **False, True**, which corresponds to **Option F**.

Answer: F
