Okay, so I've got this question about light and Fourier spectrometers. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The question has two parts: (a) finding the linear wave number for light with a 620 nm wavelength and (b) determining the band width in wavelength units given a resolution of R = 0.4 cm^-1.

Alright, starting with part (a). I remember that wave number is usually the inverse of wavelength, but wait, which units? Oh right, wave number is often expressed in cm^-1, but the question says 'linear wave number', so maybe it's per meter. Let me think. Oh wait, linear wave number is usually per meter. So yeah, if the wavelength is in meters, then the wave number is 1 divided by wavelength.

Wait, the given wavelength is 620 nm. Oh, right, nanometers to meters. So 620 nm is 620e-9 meters. So wave number (let's call it k) would be 1 divided by 620e-9 meters. Let me calculate that. 1 / 620e-9 m is approximately 1.6129e6 m^-1. So around 1.61 x 10^6 per meter. Looking at the options, many have this, like option A, F, H, J, etc. So that's part (a) done, I think.

Now part (b), the band width in wavelength. The resolution R is given as 0.4 cm^-1. I remember that the relationship between resolution (R) and band width (Δλ) is connected through the spectral resolution formula. Oh right, the formula is R = 1/(Δk), where Δk is the resolution in wave number. Or wait, maybe I have it wrong. Alternatively, the resolving power in terms of wavelength is R = λ/Δλ. Wait no, that's for when R is defined as the ability to distinguish two close lines. Oh wait, but in this question, R is given as 0.4 cm^-1. So that's the wave number resolution.

Wait, let me get this straight. The resolution R is the minimum difference in wave number that the spectrometer can resolve. So R = Δk. Since R is 0.4 cm^-1, which is 0.4 per cm. But wait, wave numbers are often in cm^-1, so when R is 0.4 cm^-1, that means the spectrometer can resolve features that are 0.4 cm^-1 apart.

But the question asks for the band width in terms of wavelength. So I need to convert this R into wavelength units.

I think the formula connecting R (wave number resolution) and the wavelength band width is:

Δλ = (λ^2) * R / (conversion factor)

Wait, more accurately, the general formula for converting between wave number and wavelength is dk = - (1/λ²) dλ, where dk is the change in wave number and dλ is the change in wavelength. But since we're dealing with magnitudes here, I can write:

Δk = (Δλ) / (λ^2)

Wait, no, because dk is the differential, but in terms of finite differences, it's approximately |Δk| ≈ (Δλ) / (λ^2), considering λ is in the same units as Δλ. But wait, units matter here because wave number is per unit length.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to find the relationship between the resolution in wave number (R) and the corresponding wavelength bandwidth (Δλ). So the resolution R (in cm^-1) is the minimum detectable difference in wave number, so Δk = R.

So, starting with:

Δk = (Δλ) / (λ^2) → but wait, all in same units. Since λ is in nanometers, but wave number is in cm^-1, perhaps I should convert units.

Wait, let's make sure of the units. Let me think in terms of meters. So λ is 620 nm = 620e-9 meters. Let me compute the wave number first as k = 1/(620e-9 m) ≈ 1.6129e6 m^-1. But since 1 m is 100 cm, 1 m^-1 is 0.01 cm^-1. So k in cm^-1 is 16129 cm^-1 approximately. Let me check: 620 nm is 6200 Å, so 1/(6200 Å) is 1/(6200e-10 m) = 1/(620e-8 cm) → 1/(620e-8 cm) = (1e8)/620 cm^-1 ≈ 161290 cm^-1. Oh wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 620 nm is 620e-9 m, which is 620e-7 cm. So k in cm^-1 is 1/(620e-7 cm) = 1/(6.2e-5 cm) = approx 16129.032 cm^-1. So about 1.6129e4 cm^-1.

But the resolution R is given as 0.4 cm^-1. So the resolution in wave number is 0.4 cm^-1.

Now, I need to find the corresponding Δλ, the band width in wavelength.

From the relation:

Δk = |dk| = (1/λ²) * |dλ|

This comes from differentiating k = 1/λ → dk = - (1/λ²) dλ. So the magnitude is (1/λ²) * Δλ.

So Δk = Δλ / (λ^2). But wait, units again. Let me make sure that all terms are in the same units.

Wait, λ is in meters, so λ^2 is in m². Δλ is in meters. So Δk would be in 1/m. But in our case, R is in cm^-1, so we need to convert either λ to cm or Δk to 1/m.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to work in cm units.

λ in cm is 620e-9 m * 100 cm/m = 620e-7 cm = 6.2e-5 cm.

So λ = 6.2e-5 cm.

Then, Δk = 0.4 cm^-1.

So using Δk = Δλ / (λ^2):

0.4 = Δλ / ( (6.2e-5)^2 )

Solving for Δλ:

Δλ = 0.4 * (6.2e-5)^2 cm.

Compute that:

(6.2e-5)^2 = (6.2)^2 * (1e-10) = 38.44e-10 = 3.844e-9 cm².

So Δλ = 0.4 * 3.844e-9 cm = 1.538e-9 cm.

Wait, 1.538e-9 cm is in cm, but we need Δλ in nm. So 1 cm is 1e7 nm. So 1.538e-9 cm = 1.538e-9 * 1e7 nm = 1.538e-2 nm, which is 0.01538 nm, approximately 0.0154 nm.

Wait, but the options give band widths in nm. Let me check the options. The options are:

A: 0.022 nm
B: 0.030
C:0.012
D:0.021
E:0.010
F:0.025
G:0.017
H:0.018
I:0.020
J:0.0153

So my calculation gives approximately 0.01538 nm, which is about 0.0154 nm. So looking for an option with around 0.015 nm. Looking at the options, J is 0.0153, which is very close. Option J's band width is 0.0153 nm.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculation. Maybe I made a mistake in the units.

Wait, let me recompute:

λ = 620 nm = 620e-9 m = 6.2e-7 meters.

Wait, when I converted to cm, that would be 6.2e-5 cm because 1 m = 100 cm, so 620e-9 m = 620e-7 cm = 6.2e-5 cm. So that part is correct.

Then, (λ in cm)^2 is (6.2e-5 cm)^2 = (6.2)^2 * (1e-5)^2 cm² → 38.44 * 1e-10 cm² → 3.844e-9 cm².

Δλ = R * (λ)^2 → 0.4 cm^-1 * 3.844e-9 cm².

Wait, cm^-1 multiplied by cm² gives cm. So that is correct. So 0.4 * 3.844e-9 cm = 1.5376e-9 cm.

Convert to nm: 1.5376e-9 cm = 1.5376e-9 * 1e7 nm = 1.5376e-2 nm → 0.015376 nm, which is approximately 0.0154 nm, so about 0.0153 when rounded to four significant figures.

So that's part (b) done. Now, for part (a), the wave number in per meter was 1.61e6 per m. So looking for an option where part (a) is 1.61e6 and part (b) is 0.0153 nm.

Looking at the options:

Option J: (a) 1.61e6, (b) 0.0153 nm.

Yes. So the correct answer is option J.

Wait but let me double-check the calculation steps again because sometimes I might have made a mistake.

Alternative approach: since Δk = R is given as 0.4 cm^-1. So in terms of 1/m, that's 0.4 * 100 = 40 1/m, because 1 cm^-1 is 100 m^-1.

Wait no, wait a second. 1 cm is 0.01 m, so 1 cm^-1 is 100 m^-1. So 0.4 cm^-1 is 40 m^-1.

Wait, perhaps I can use this to calculate Δλ.

We have:

Δk = 40 m^-1.

Δk = Δλ / (λ^2)

So Δλ = Δk * λ^2.

λ is 620e-9 m.

So:

Δλ = 40 m^-1 * (620e-9 m)^2.

Compute that:

(620e-9)^2 = (620)^2 * (e-9)^2 = 384400 * 1e-18 m² → 3.844e-14 m².

So Δλ = 40 * 3.844e-14 m³ → 1.5376e-12 m → which is 1.5376e-12 m * 1e9 nm/m = 1.5376e-3 nm → 0.0015376 nm. Wait, that's way too small. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, I must have messed up the units somewhere.

Wait, no, this approach gives a different result. Hmm. So I'm getting conflicting answers between the two methods. Which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the second approach. Let me recompute.

Wait, the first approach (using cm) gave me 0.0153 nm. The second approach (using m) is giving me 0.0015376 nm, which is 0.0015 nm. That's a big discrepancy. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, in the second approach, let's redo it.

Δk = 40 m^-1 (since 0.4 cm^-1 = 40 m^-1).

λ = 620e-9 m.

Δk = (Δλ) / (λ^2) → solving for Δλ:

Δλ = Δk * λ².

So plugging in:

Δλ = 40 m^-1 * (620e-9 m)^2.

Calculate (620e-9)^2: 620^2 = 384400, (e-9)^2 = e-18. So 384400e-18 = 3.844e-14 m².

Δλ = 40 * 3.844e-14 = 1.5376e-12 m.

Convert to nanometers: 1.5376e-12 m * 1e9 nm/m = 1.5376e-3 nm = 0.0015376 nm. That's about 0.0015 nm, which is much smaller than the first result.

Hmm, so this is conflicting. What's wrong here?

Ah, I realize the mistake. The formula Δk = Δλ / (λ^2) is valid only when Δk is in reciprocal of the same unit as λ. So, if λ is in meters, then Δk must be in 1/m. So in the second approach, that's correct. But in the first approach, when using cm, I calculated correctly as well.

Wait, but the answers are so vastly different. So what did I do wrong?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the conversion. Let me recompute the first approach.

First approach (using cm):

λ = 620 nm = 620e-9 m = 620e-7 cm = 6.2e-5 cm.

So λ is 6.2e-5 cm.

Δk = R = 0.4 cm^-1.

Then, Δλ = Δk * (λ)^2.

So, Δλ = 0.4 cm^-1 * (6.2e-5 cm)^2.

Compute (6.2e-5)^2 = 38.44e-10 cm².

So 0.4 * 38.44e-10 = 15.376e-10 cm → 1.5376e-9 cm.

Convert cm to nm: 1 cm = 1e7 nm. So 1.5376e-9 cm = 1.5376e-2 nm = 0.015376 nm.

So that's 0.0154 nm.

But in the second approach, using m, I got 0.0015 nm. Which is way smaller. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, I think I see the problem. In the second approach, I incorrectly converted R to m^-1. Because R is given in cm^-1, which is 0.4 cm^-1. So when converting to m^-1, it's 0.4 * 100 = 40 m^-1. But wait, in the first approach, I treated R as 0.4 cm^-1 and used λ in cm, which worked. In the second approach, I treated R as 40 m^-1 and λ in meters, but that gives a different answer.

Wait, that can't be. There must be a miscalculation in one of the approaches.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is correct only when the units are consistent. Let me think: when using λ in cm, then Δk is in cm^-1, and Δλ is in cm. So the formula is correct.

When using λ in meters, Δk is in m^-1, and Δλ is in meters. But in this case, when I plug in R as 40 m^-1, I get a much smaller Δλ. That suggests I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check the differentiation again.

Wave number k = 1/λ → dk = - (1/λ²) dλ. So dλ = - λ² dk.

So the magnitude is |dλ| = λ² |dk|.

Ah, right. So in the first approach, I used Δλ = R * λ², which is correct when R is in cm^-1 and λ in cm.

In the second approach, using R as 40 m^-1 and λ in meters, I compute Δλ as 40 * (620e-9 m)^2. Let me compute that again.

40 * (620e-9)^2.

620e-9 squared is (620)^2 * 1e-18 = 384400 * 1e-18 = 3.844e-14 m².

Multiply by 40: 40 * 3.844e-14 = 1.5376e-12 m.

Convert to nm: 1.5376e-12 m = 1.5376e-3 nm = 0.0015376 nm.

Wait, that's way smaller than the first approach. So that's a problem. Why the discrepancy?

Ah, I think I see the mistake now. The formula Δλ = R * λ² is correct, but R is in the same units as k, which is 1/λ. So when you're in cm, you use cm, and when in meters, you use meters.

Wait, but in the first approach, I have R in cm^-1, and λ in cm. So the calculation gives Δλ in cm.

In the second approach, R is in m^-1, and λ in meters, so Δλ is in meters.

But the two approaches give different answers, which can't be right. So I must have messed up the formula somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Δλ = (R) / (k²), where R is the resolution in wave number (per cm), and k is the wave number in per cm.

Wait, let's try that. Because if k = 1/λ, then dk = Δk = R.

So, from k = 1/λ → λ = 1/k.

Differentiating: dλ = - (1/k²) dk → |dλ| = (1/k²) |dk|.

So, Δλ = R * (1/k²).

Wait, but R is given as 0.4 cm^-1. So let's compute it this way.

k in cm^-1 is 1.6129e4 cm^-1, as calculated earlier.

So, k = 1/(620e-7 cm) → 1/(6.2e-5 cm) → approx 16129 cm^-1.

So, k ≈ 16129 cm^-1.

Then, Δλ = R / (k^2) → 0.4 / (16129)^2 cm.

Compute that:

16129 squared is approx (1.6e4)^2 = 2.56e8. So 0.4 / 2.56e8 = approx 1.5625e-9 cm.

Convert to nm: 1.5625e-9 cm = 1.5625e-9 *
