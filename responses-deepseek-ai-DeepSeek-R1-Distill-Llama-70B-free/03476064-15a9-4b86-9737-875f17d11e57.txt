Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about calculating the normality of a solution. Hmm, I remember that normality (N) is related to molarity, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think.

The question says that 40 ml of the solution is needed to neutralize 0.56 grams of KOH. I guess I need to figure out the normality of the solution based on this information.

First, I think I should find out how many equivalents of KOH are present. Because normality is about equivalents per liter. Right, so KOH is a strong base, so it dissociates completely in water. Each mole of KOH gives one mole of OH- ions. So the equivalent weight of KOH is the same as its molar mass.

Wait, the formula for normality is N = equivalents per liter. So I'll need to calculate the number of equivalents in the given grams of KOH and then see what volume of solution is required to neutralize that.

Let me break this down step by step.

First, find the molar mass of KOH. K is about 39 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So 39 + 16 + 1 = 56 g/mol. So each mole of KOH is 56 grams.

The given mass is 0.56 grams. Moles of KOH would be mass divided by molar mass. So 0.56 g / 56 g/mol = 0.01 mol. Oh wait, because KOH gives one OH- per molecule, that's 0.01 equivalents.

Wait, no. Equivalents for a base like KOH is calculated by multiplying moles by the valence factor. Since KOH is a monobasic base (it can donate one OH- per molecule), the valence factor is 1. So equivalents = moles Ã— 1 = 0.01 equivalents.

In neutralization reactions, acid and base equivalents must be equal. So the solution's equivalents should equal the KOH's equivalents.

The solution's volume used is 40 ml. But wait, normality is per liter, so I need to convert that to liters. 40 ml is 0.04 liters.

So the normality N of the solution would be equivalents per liter. So N = 0.01 equivalents / 0.04 liters.

Let me calculate that. 0.01 divided by 0.04 is 0.25. So N is 0.25.

Wait, but let me double-check. The reaction is between KOH and the solution. Assuming the solution is an acid, right? Because neutralization is acid-base. So KOH (base) reacts with an acid (like HCl maybe) to form a salt and water.

The normality of the acid solution would be the same as the normality of the KOH solution because they are 1:1 in terms of equivalents. So yeah, the calculation seems right.

So the normality is 0.25 N. Looking at the options, option F is 0.25 N. So the answer should be F.

To calculate the normality of the solution, we start by determining the number of equivalents of KOH. The molar mass of KOH is calculated as:

\[
\text{Molar mass of KOH} = 39 \, (\text{K}) + 16 \, (\text{O}) + 1 \, (\text{H}) = 56 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

The given mass of KOH is 0.56 g. The number of moles of KOH is:

\[
\text{Moles of KOH} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar mass}} = \frac{0.56}{56} = 0.01 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Since KOH is a monobasic base, each mole of KOH corresponds to one equivalent. Therefore, the number of equivalents of KOH is:

\[
\text{Equivalents of KOH} = 0.01 \, \text{mol} \times 1 = 0.01 \, \text{equivalents}.
\]

The volume of the solution required to neutralize 0.56 g of KOH is 40 ml, which is equivalent to:

\[
\text{Volume in liters} = \frac{40}{1000} = 0.04 \, \text{L}.
\]

The normality (N) of the solution is given by:

\[
N = \frac{\text{Equivalents}}{\text{Volume (in liters)}} = \frac{0.01}{0.04} = 0.25 \, \text{N}.
\]

Thus, the normality of the solution is 0.25 N. Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**F: 0.25 N**
