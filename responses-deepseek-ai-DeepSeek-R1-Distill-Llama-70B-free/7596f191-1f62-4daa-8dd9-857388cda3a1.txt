Question:

A construction contractor brought a breach of contract claim in federal court against a homeowner who had hired the contractor to build an apartment over an existing garage. The action turned on the scope of the work covered by the contract. The contractor and the homeowner were the only witnesses at the bench trial, and they strongly disagreed about the scope of the work. At the end of the trial, the judge stated findings of fact on the record but never issued a written opinion. Neither party objected to the findings. The judge found in favor of the homeowner, and the contractor appealed. Is the appellate court likely to overturn the findings?

Options:

A: No, because the appellate court must give due regard to the trial judge's opportunity to determine witness credibility.
B: Yes, because the contractor and homeowner had different views on the scope of the work.
C: Yes, because a judge must set forth findings of fact in a written opinion or memorandum of decision.
D: No, because the judge's findings of fact were stated on the record.
E: Yes, because the homeowner was found in favor.
F: No, because the contractor brought the claim in federal court.
G: Yes, because there were disputed issues of fact at trial.
H: No, because the contractor didn't provide sufficient evidence to support the claim.
I: Yes, because the appellate court has the power to overturn the findings.
J: No, because the contractor failed to object to the findings when the judge stated them in open court.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about appellate review of a bench trial. Hmm. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The situation is a breach of contract case between a contractor and a homeowner. The contractor sued in federal court. The case hinged on the scope of the work covered by the contract. Both parties testified at the bench trial, and their testimonies strongly disagreed. After the trial, the judge made findings of fact orally but didn't issue a written opinion. Neither party objected to these findings. The judge ruled in favor of the homeowner, and now the contractor is appealing. The question is whether the appellate court is likely to overturn the findings.

Alright, so I need to think about how appellate courts review findings of fact from a bench trial. I remember that in federal courts, when a trial is held before a judge without a jury (a bench trial), the judge's findings of fact are reviewed under the "clearly erroneous" standard. This means that the appellate court will only overturn the findings if they are clearly erroneous. The idea is that the trial judge has the advantage of seeing the witnesses and assessing their credibility firsthand.

Looking at the options:

Option A says no because the appellate court gives due regard to the trial judge's opportunity to assess credibility. That sounds familiar. The trial judge's assessment of credibility is a key factor, so the appellate court would defer to that unless it's clearly wrong.

Option B says yes because the parties disagreed. But disagreement alone doesn't make a finding erroneous; the court needs a clear error, not just a disagreement.

Option C says yes because the judge didn't write an opinion. Wait, I think the judge is required to make findings of fact and conclusions of law. But can they be oral? I'm not sure. I think in some cases, oral findings are acceptable if they're sufficiently detailed. If the judge stated the findings on the record, that might suffice, even without a written opinion.

Option D says no because the findings were stated on the record. This relates to option C. If the findings were oral but clear, maybe that's enough. But I'm not certain if the lack of a written opinion is a problem. I think the key is whether the findings are adequate, not whether they're written.

Option E says yes because the homeowner won. That doesn't make sense; the appellate decision shouldn't hinge on who won but on the correctness of the findings.

Option F says no because it's federal court. But the standard applies regardless of whether it's federal or state, I think. So this option doesn't directly address the issue.

Option G says yes because there were disputed facts. But having disputed facts is normal in trials. The appellate court doesn't overturn just because there's a dispute; it looks for clear error.

Option H says no because the contractor didn't provide enough evidence. But the question doesn't give info on the sufficiency of evidence; it's more about the standard of review.

Option I says yes because the appellate court has the power. Well, technically, they have the power, but they usually exercise it only in clear error cases.

Option J says no because the contractor didn't object when the findings were stated. I'm not sure about this. I think that failure to object to findings might waive some arguments on appeal, but the clearly erroneous standard is about the appellate court's review, not about objections. So maybe J is a trap.

So, the main issue is the standard of review. The appellate court uses the clearly erroneous standard for findings of fact. They give deference to the trial judge's assessment of witness credibility. So if the judge made findings based on credibility, the appellate court is less likely to overturn them unless it's clear error.

In this case, the judge's findings were oral but on the record. Neither party objected. So the key factor is whether the findings were clearly erroneous. The question is whether the appellate court is likely to overturn. The options suggest that A and D are possibilities. But I think A is more about the reason for deference (credibility), which is a stronger point.

Wait, option C says yes because the judge didn't write an opinion. But Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a)(1) requires the court to state findings and conclusions. They can be oral if stated in the record. So maybe C is incorrect because oral findings are acceptable.

So the correct answer would be A: No, because the appellate court must give due regard to the trial judge's opportunity to determine witness credibility.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: Did the judge's oral findings suffice? I think they do as long as they are clear enough. So D says no because the findings were on the record. So D would be correct if the issue was about the form of the findings, but the real issue is the standard of review, making A more accurate.

So the answer should be A.

The question revolves around the standard of appellate review for findings of fact in a bench trial. Under federal law, when a trial is conducted before a judge without a jury, the appellate court reviews the judge's findings of fact under the "clearly erroneous" standard. This means the appellate court will only overturn the findings if they are clearly erroneous, giving significant deference to the trial judge's assessment of witness credibility and factual determinations.

In this case, the judge stated findings of fact orally on the record but did not issue a written opinion. Neither party objected to these findings. The key issue is whether the appellate court is likely to overturn the findings. The "clearly erroneous" standard applies here, and the appellate court will defer to the trial judge's findings unless they are clearly wrong. The oral nature of the findings does not undermine their validity, as long as they are sufficiently detailed and stated on the record.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Correct. The appellate court must give due regard to the trial judge's opportunity to determine witness credibility, which is a key component of the "clearly erroneous" standard.
- **B**: Incorrect. Disagreement between parties does not automatically make the findings erroneous; the appellate court requires a showing of clear error.
- **C**: Incorrect. While written findings are often preferred, oral findings stated on the record are sufficient under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a)(1).
- **D**: Incorrect. The findings being stated on the record is a valid method, but the key issue is the standard of review, not the form of the findings.
- **E**: Incorrect. The appellate court's decision does not hinge on which party prevailed but on the correctness of the findings.
- **F**: Incorrect. The standard of review applies regardless of whether the case is in federal or state court.
- **G**: Incorrect. Disputed facts are common in trials, but the appellate court only overturns findings if they are clearly erroneous.
- **H**: Incorrect. The question does not provide evidence to suggest the contractor failed to provide sufficient evidence.
- **I**: Incorrect. While the appellate court has the power to overturn findings, it will only do so in cases of clear error.
- **J**: Incorrect. Failure to object to findings does not necessarily waive appellate review; the "clearly erroneous" standard still applies.

The best answer is **A**, as it correctly reflects the deference given to the trial judge's findings under the "clearly erroneous" standard.

**Answer: A**
