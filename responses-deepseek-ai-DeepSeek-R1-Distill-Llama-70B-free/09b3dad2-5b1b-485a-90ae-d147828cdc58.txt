Question:

7.3-3. Let $p$ equal the proportion of triathletes who suffered a training-related overuse injury during the past year. Out of 330 triathletes who responded to a survey, 167 indicated that they had suffered such an injury during the past year.
(a) Use these data to give a point estimate of $p$.

A:  $0.5061$
B: $0.6000$
C: $0.4000$

E: $0.5894$
F: $0.4562$
G: $0.6531$
H: $0.3077$
I: $0.7500$
J: $0.5500$

Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about calculating a point estimate for the proportion of triathletes who had a training-related overuse injury last year. Hmm, I remember that a point estimate is a single value used to estimate a population parameter. 

The problem gives me that p is the proportion we're interested in. Out of 330 triathletes surveyed, 167 said they had such an injury. So, I think the point estimate for p would be the sample proportion. Right, the formula for the sample proportion is the number of successes (injuries) divided by the sample size.

Let me write that down. So, the number of successes is 167, and the sample size is 330. So, p hat (the point estimate) should be 167 divided by 330. Let me compute that. 

Wait, let me do the division. 167 divided by 330. Let me see, 330 goes into 167 zero times. Oh wait, wait, no, wait— I think I mixed that up. Wait, 167 is the numerator, and 330 is the denominator. So, 167 ÷ 330. 

Let me compute that. 330 times 0.5 is 165. Hmm, 167 is 2 more than 165. So, 0.5 plus (2/330). 2 divided by 330 is approximately 0.00606. So adding that to 0.5 gives 0.50606. Wait, that's roughly 0.5061.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.5061, so that's probably the answer. But let me double-check the calculation to be sure I didn't make a mistake.

Alternatively, I can do this on paper. 167 / 330. Let's see:

330 ) 167.000

330 goes into 1670 five times (5*330=1650). Subtract 1650 from 1670 gives 20. Bring down the next 0. 330 goes into 200 zero times, so next digit is 0. 330 goes into 2000 six times? Let's see: 6*330=1980. Subtract from 2000, gives 20. Bring down the next 0, making 200 again. So, it's 0.506060..., which is 0.5061 when rounded to four decimal places. So yeah, option A is correct.

Wait, but wait another thought: sometimes people calculate proportions as a percentage, but the question just asks for the proportion, so 0.5061 is correct, not 50.61%. So, the answer should definitely be A.

To calculate the point estimate of \( p \), the proportion of triathletes who suffered a training-related overuse injury, we use the formula for the sample proportion:

\[
\hat{p} = \frac{\text{number of successes}}{\text{sample size}}
\]

Here, the number of successes is 167 (triathletes who reported an injury), and the sample size is 330. Substituting these values:

\[
\hat{p} = \frac{167}{330}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\hat{p} \approx 0.5061
\]

This matches option A. Therefore, the correct answer is:

A: \( 0.5061 \)
