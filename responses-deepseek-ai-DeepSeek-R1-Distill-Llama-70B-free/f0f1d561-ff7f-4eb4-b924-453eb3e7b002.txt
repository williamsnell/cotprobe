Question:

A defendant was arrested and charged with burglarizing a home. At trial, the main issue of contention centered on the identity of the burglar. The state called the homeowner to testify, but his identification testimony was inconclusive. The homeowner testified that he was asleep during the burglary and awoke as the burglar was fleeing the premises. The homeowner admitted that he didn't see the face of the burglar and couldn't even tell whether the person was male or female. Thereafter, the prosecution offers evidence that at the time of the burglary, the defendant needed money to defend himself against other burglary charges. This proffered evidence should be

Options:

A: excluded, as it distracts from the main issue of identifying the burglar.
B: admitted as it shows the defendant's potential desperation.
C: excluded as it does not provide direct evidence of the defendant's involvement in the crime.
D: admitted without restriction as probative evidence of motive.
E: excluded as substantially more unfairly prejudicial than probative.
F: excluded as it could lead to bias against the defendant.
G: excluded as lacking any probative value.
H: admitted, but with a cautionary instruction from the judge to the jury to consider the evidence carefully.
I: admitted, provided the court instructs the jury to limit use of the evidence to the defendant's motive to burglarize.
J: admitted, provided the court instructs the jury to consider the defendant's financial status.

Okay, so I've got this evidence law question here, and I'm trying to work through it step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about a defendant charged with burglary. The main issue at trial is the identity of the burglar. The homeowner testified but couldn't make a positive ID—he was asleep, only saw the burglar fleeing, didn't see the face, and couldn't even tell if it was male or female. So, the prosecution's case on identity seems pretty weak.

Now, the prosecution is offering evidence that at the time of the burglary, the defendant needed money to defend himself against other burglary charges. The question is whether this evidence should be admitted or not.

I remember that evidence can be excluded if it's more prejudicial than probative. Also, under the Federal Rules of Evidence, certain types of evidence, like evidence of other crimes or bad acts, are generally inadmissible unless they fall under specific exceptions, like motive.

So, the issue here is whether the defendant's financial need constitutes admissible evidence of motive. Motive can be a valid reason to admit such evidence. But I also recall that while motive is relevant, if the evidence is about a specific need related to another crime, it might be crossing into prior bad acts territory, which is usually excluded.

Wait, but in this case, the evidence is about the defendant's financial situation leading to a motive for the burglary, not about a prior conviction or another crime he committed. It's more about his financial need. So, that might be okay as it shows why he would commit the burglary—motive.

But wait, the other side is that this evidence could be prejudicial. The jury might think, "Oh, he was in trouble and needed money, so he must have done it." But without more, does that make it inadmissible? Or is the probative value on motive sufficient to allow it?

I think that under FRE 404(b), evidence of other crimes or bad acts is not admissible for propensity, but it can be admitted for other purposes like motive, opportunity, etc. So if the prosecution is offering this evidence to show motive, it should be allowed, provided the judge doesn't find it too prejudicial.

Wait, but the defendant needing money for his defense against other burglary charges—does that relate to the current burglary charge? It might. He needed money for his defense, so he burglarized a home to get it. That seems like a direct motive.

So the options: Let's look at them.

Option D: admitted without restriction as probative evidence of motive. But usually, even if admissible, courts might give a limiting instruction.

Option I: admitted, provided the court instructs the jury to limit the evidence to motive. That makes sense because without a limiting instruction, the jury might misuse the evidence as propensity.

Option E: excluded as more prejudicial than probative. But I think the evidence does have probative value on motive, so E might not be correct.

Option C says it's excluded because it's not direct evidence. But that's not the standard. It just needs to be relevant, not necessarily direct.

Option A: excluded because it distracts. I don't think that's a valid legal reason.

Option B: admitted as showing desperation. Desperation could be part of motive, but I think the better reason is motive.

Option H: admitted with a cautionary instruction. That's similar to I, but I isn't specific about the instruction, just that it's limited to motive.

So, the correct approach is that the evidence is admissible for motive, but the court should instruct the jury accordingly. So the answer would be I.

Wait, but some might argue that the evidence is about a prior charge, which is a pending case, not a conviction. So does that affect admissibility? I think it's still okay because it's about the defendant's situation at the time, not about prior crimes he's committed, but rather about his current legal troubles leading to a need for money.

So, the best answer seems to be I.

The question revolves around the admissibility of evidence that the defendant needed money to defend himself against other burglary charges, which the prosecution offers to establish motive for the burglary. The key issue is whether this evidence is admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence, particularly Rule 404(b), which allows evidence of motive but prohibits using prior bad acts to show propensity.

The homeowner’s testimony was inconclusive, and the prosecution’s case on identity was weak. The evidence about the defendant’s financial need is not direct evidence of the crime but could be relevant to show motive. Under Rule 404(b), such evidence is admissible if it serves a purpose other than propensity, such as motive. However, to prevent the jury from misusing the evidence, a limiting instruction is typically required to confine its use to the issue of motive.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option I** is correct because it allows the evidence for motive, provided the court instructs the jury to limit its use to that purpose. This aligns with the requirement for a limiting instruction to prevent prejudice.
- Other options, such as excluding the evidence as prejudicial (E) or lacking probative value (G), are incorrect because the evidence has probative value on motive.
- Options like admitting the evidence without restriction (D) or with a general cautionary instruction (H) are less precise than Option I, which specifically ties the instruction to the purpose of motive.

Thus, the evidence should be admitted, but with a clear instruction limiting its use to the defendant’s motive.
