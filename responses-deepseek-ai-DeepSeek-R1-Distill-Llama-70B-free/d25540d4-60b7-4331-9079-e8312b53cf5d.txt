Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question is asking.

The reaction given is CaCO3(s) → CaO(s) + CO2(g) at 950°C and CO2 pressure of 1 atm. The enthalpy change (∆H) is 176 kJ/mole. The question asks me to calculate the change in internal energy (∆E) for this reaction, and the options are from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that enthalpy and internal energy are related. The formula that connects them is ∆H = ∆E + ∆(PV), right? But wait, under what conditions? Oh, right, when the process occurs at constant pressure, the change in enthalpy is equal to the heat transferred. But here, I think I need to relate ∆E to ∆H using the work done.

Another formula comes to mind: ∆E = q + w, where q is heat and w is work. But wait, that's for a system at constant volume, I think. Wait, no, I might be mixing up. Let me think again.

At constant pressure, the heat q is equal to ∆H. Because H is defined as H = U + PV, so when you have a process at constant pressure, the change in H is q_p. So, ∆H = q_p.

Now, the first law of thermodynamics says that ∆E = q + w. But wait, work done by the system is considered negative. So when the system does work, it's losing energy, so the work is positive when done on the system. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, let me get this straight. The first law is ∆E = q - PΔV if the work is pressure-volume work done by the system. Because when the system does work, it loses energy. So, when a gas expands, it does work on the surroundings, so the system's internal energy decreases.

But in this problem, the reaction produces CO2 gas. So the system is doing work against the external pressure. So for this reaction, the volume change is significant because a gas is being produced.

Wait, the problem says to assume that the volume change of the solid phases is negligible compared to the gas produced. So I can consider that the only significant volume change is from the CO2 gas.

So the reaction is producing CO2 gas. Let me write the reaction again:

CaCO3(s) → CaO(s) + CO2(g)

At 950°C and 1 atm CO2 pressure.

Now, the moles of gas here: on the product side, we have 1 mole of CO2 gas. Reactants are solids, so their volume is negligible.

So the change in moles of gas (Δn) is +1 mole.

Now, the work done by the system when gas is produced at constant pressure is PΔV. Since the pressure is constant, the work done is P_ext * ΔV.

But wait, the formula for work done when the system expands against a constant external pressure is w = -P_ext * ΔV. Because when the system does work, the internal energy decreases, so the work is negative from the system's perspective.

Wait, but when the system expands, ΔV is positive (since V increases), so the work done by the system is positive. But in the first law, ∆E = q + w, where w is work done on the system. So if the system does work, w is negative.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

The formula I think I need here is ∆E = ∆H - PΔV, but wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me recall the exact relationship.

Ah, right. Since H = U + PV, then ∆H = ∆U + ∆(PV). Now, if the pressure is constant, ∆(PV) = PΔV. So, ∆H = ∆E + PΔV.

So, rearranging, ∆E = ∆H - PΔV.

That makes sense. Because if the system does work (volume increases), PΔV is positive, so ∆E would be less than ∆H.

In this case, the system is producing CO2 gas, which increases the volume. So PΔV would be positive, meaning that ∆E is less than ∆H.

But wait, CO2 is produced as a gas, so the change in volume is positive. So PΔV is P times the change in volume of the system.

But let me think about the sign conventions. From the system's point of view, when it does work (expansion), the work is negative. So the work done by the system is P_ext * ΔV, and since it's done by the system, it's positive. But when calculating ∆E, the work done on the system is negative, so ∆E = q + w, where w is negative.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to stick with the equation ∆H = ∆E + PΔV when pressure is constant.

So, to find ∆E, I can compute ∆E = ∆H - PΔV.

Now, the problem gives me that the reaction is at 1 atm pressure, so P is 1 atm.

But wait, what is ΔV in this case? The problem states that the volume change of solids is negligible, so ΔV is approximately the volume of the CO2 gas produced.

So, for each mole of CO2 produced, the volume change is the molar volume of CO2 at given conditions.

But wait, wait. The reaction is at 950°C, which is a high temperature. I need to calculate the volume of CO2 at 950°C and 1 atm pressure.

Wait, but 1 atm is the pressure. So, using the ideal gas law, PV = nRT.

But wait, CO2 is a gas here, so n is 1 mole (since the reaction produces 1 mole of CO2). So, V = nRT/P.

But wait, let me note the values:

n = 1 mole

R is the gas constant. Let me think: R is 8.314 J/mol·K when using SI units.

Wait, but the temperature is 950°C. So in Kelvin, that's 950 + 273.15 = 1223.15 K.

P is 1 atm. Wait, but when using R in J, pressure should be in Pascals. So 1 atm is 101325 Pa.

So, V = nRT/P.

Plugging in the numbers:

n=1, R=8.314, T=1223.15, P=101325.

So V = (1)(8.314)(1223.15) / 101325.

Let me calculate that.

First, compute numerator: 8.314 * 1223.15 ≈ let's compute 8 * 1200 is 9600, but precise calculation:

8.314 * 1223.15 = ?

Wait, 1223.15 is approximately 1223.

So 8.314 * 1223 = let me compute 8 * 1223 = 9784, 0.314*1223 ≈ 384. So total is about 9784 + 384 = 10168 J/(mol·K) * K = J/mol. Wait, no, wait, J would be for work, but V is in m³.

Wait, no, R is in J/(mol·K), so V would be in m³.

Wait, let me compute it properly.

8.314 J/(mol·K) * 1223.15 K = 8.314 * 1223.15 = approx 10168 J/mol.

Then, divide by P (101325 Pa) gives V = 10168 / 101325 ≈ 0.1003 m³ per mole.

Wait, 101325 is 1.01325e5.

10168 / 1.01325e5 ≈ approx 0.1003 m³.

So, V is approximately 0.1003 m³/mol.

But wait, CO2 is produced as a gas, so the change in volume, ΔV, is +0.1003 m³.

Because the reactants are solids, their volume is negligible, so the volume of the system increases by this amount.

Now, PΔV would be P * ΔV. But P is 1 atm = 101325 Pa.

So PΔV = 101325 Pa * 0.1003 m³.

Pa·m³ is equivalent to N·m, which is joules.

So, 101325 * 0.1003 = ?

Let me compute 101325 * 0.1 = 10132.5, and 101325 * 0.0003 = 30.3975.

So total is 10132.5 + 30.3975 = 10162.8975 J.

Which is approximately 10163 J, or about 10.163 kJ.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation:

101325 * 0.1003 = ?

Let me compute 101325 * 0.1 = 10132.5

101325 * 0.0003 = 30.3975

Total: 10132.5 + 30.3975 = 10162.8975 J → 10.163 kJ.

So PΔV is approximately 10.163 kJ per mole.

Wait, but in the equation, ∆H = ∆E + PΔV → ∆E = ∆H - PΔV.

So, since ∆H is given as 176 kJ, then ∆E = 176 kJ - 10.163 kJ.

That would be 165.837 kJ, which is approximately 166 kJ.

Looking at the options, option B is 166 kJ, and option D is 156, option H is 175, etc. So the closest would be option B:166 kJ.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me confirm the units again. The reaction is per mole, so all the calculations are per mole. ΔH is 176 kJ per mole, and PΔV is 10.163 kJ per mole. So 176 - 10.163 = 165.837, which rounds to 166 kJ. So ∆E is approximately 166 kJ. So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me confirm the formula again. The correct formula is ∆E = ∆H - PΔV. Because, from H = U + PV, so ∆H = ∆U + ∆(PV). At constant pressure, ∆(PV) = P∆V. So ∆H = ∆E + P∆V → ∆E = ∆H - P∆V.

Yes, that's correct.

So the calculation seems right. So the answer is B:166 kJ.
</think>

To calculate the change in internal energy (∆E) for the reaction:

**CaCO₃(s) → CaO(s) + CO₂(g)**  
at 950°C and 1 atm, we use the relationship between enthalpy (∆H) and internal energy (∆E):  

\[
\Delta H = \Delta E + P\Delta V
\]

Rearranging for ∆E:  

\[
\Delta E = \Delta H - P\Delta V
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the reaction and volume change
The reaction produces 1 mole of CO₂ gas, while the reactants and products are solids with negligible volume changes. Thus, the significant volume change is due to the CO₂ gas.

### Step 2: Calculate the volume of CO₂
Using the ideal gas law, \( PV = nRT \), where:  
- \( n = 1 \, \text{mol} \)  
- \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \)  
- \( T = 950^\circ \text{C} = 1223.15 \, \text{K} \)  
- \( P = 1 \, \text{atm} = 101325 \, \text{Pa} \)  

\[
V = \frac{nRT}{P} = \frac{(1)(8.314)(1223.15)}{101325} \approx 0.1003 \, \text{m}^3
\]

Thus, \( \Delta V \approx 0.1003 \, \text{m}^3 \) (since solids contribute negligibly to volume).

### Step 3: Calculate \( P\Delta V \)
\[
P\Delta V = (101325 \, \text{Pa})(0.1003 \, \text{m}^3) \approx 10162.9 \, \text{J} \approx 10.163 \, \text{kJ}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate ∆E
Given \( \Delta H = 176 \, \text{kJ/mol} \), substitute into the equation:  

\[
\Delta E = \Delta H - P\Delta V = 176 \, \text{kJ} - 10.163 \, \text{kJ} \approx 165.837 \, \text{kJ}
\]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, \( \Delta E \approx 166 \, \text{kJ} \).

### Final Answer
The closest option to the calculated value is **B: 166 kJ**.
