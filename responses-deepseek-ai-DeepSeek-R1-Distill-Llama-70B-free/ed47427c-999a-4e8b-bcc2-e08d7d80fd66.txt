Okay, so I've got this problem here about heating water in a container. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think aloud and see if I can get it right.

First, the problem says the container has dimensions 2.5 meters, 50 centimeters, and 60 millimeters. Hmm, wait, that doesn't make sense because usually containers have three dimensions like length, width, height. Oh wait, maybe I'm misreading it. Oh, no, wait, 2.5 m × 50 cm × 60 mm. So I need to convert all of these to the same unit to calculate the volume correctly.

Right, volume is length × width × height. So I should probably convert everything to meters, or maybe centimeters. Let's see. Let me choose meters because that's the largest unit here.

Wait, 2.5 meters is already in meters. 50 cm is 0.5 meters because 100 cm is 1 m, so 50 cm is half a meter. 60 mm is 0.06 meters because 1000 mm is 1 m, so 60 mm is 60/1000 = 0.06 m.

So the dimensions in meters are 2.5 m, 0.5 m, and 0.06 m. Now, volume is 2.5 * 0.5 * 0.06. Let me calculate that. 

2.5 * 0.5 is 1.25. Then 1.25 * 0.06 = 0.075 cubic meters. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check: 2.5 × 0.5 is indeed 1.25, and 1.25 × 0.06 is 0.075 m³. Yeah.

But wait, sometimes people use liters for water volume. I remember that 1 cubic meter is 1000 liters. So 0.075 m³ would be 75 liters because 0.075 × 1000 = 75 liters. That makes sense because 1 m³ is a thousand liters, so 0.075 is 75 liters.

Okay, so the mass of the water. Since water has a density of 1 kg per liter, 75 liters would weigh 75 kg. Right? Because 1 liter of water is approximately 1 kg. So mass m is 75 kg.

Now, the problem is about heating this water from 32°F to 212°F. Wait, Fahrenheit? Oh right, but the formula for heat transfer is Q = m * c * ΔT, where c is specific heat capacity. But I remember that the specific heat of water is usually given in cal/(g·°C) or BTUs, but since the question asks for kilocalories, I should probably use calories.

Wait, but the temperature change is in Fahrenheit. Oh, that's a problem because the formula uses degrees in Celsius or Kelvin because the size of a degree is different. So I need to convert the temperature difference from Fahrenheit to Celsius.

Wait, the temperature change is from 32°F to 212°F. That's actually the freezing and boiling points of water in Fahrenheit. Because water freezes at 32°F and boils at 212°F. So the temperature difference is 212 - 32 = 180°F. But to use in the formula, I need to convert this to Celsius degrees because each degree F is not the same as a degree C.

Wait, but wait a second. The formula Q = mcΔT uses ΔT in Celsius or Kelvin because a change of 1 degree C is equal to a change of 1 Kelvin. But Fahrenheit degrees are different. So I can't directly use 180°F as the ΔT. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when calculating the change in temperature, the conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit for the delta is different.

Wait no, here's the thing: When calculating a temperature difference (ΔT), the change in Fahrenheit degrees can be converted to Celsius by multiplying by 5/9. Because the size of a degree Fahrenheit is smaller than Celsius. So a change of 1°F is equal to 5/9 °C. So 180°F change is 180*(5/9) °C. Let me calculate that.

180 divided by 9 is 20, 20 multiplied by 5 is 100. So 180°F change is equal to 100°C change. Oh wait, that makes sense because the boiling point is 100°C, so that's correct. So ΔT is 100°C.

Okay, so now, the specific heat capacity of water is about 1 calorie per gram per degree Celsius. Because I remember that it takes 1 calorie to raise 1 gram of water by 1°C. But wait, sometimes it's given as 4.184 joules per gram per degree Celsius, but since we're dealing with kilocalories, maybe I should use the calorie unit.

So the specific heat c is 1 cal/(g·°C). But wait, the mass is in kg. Oh wait, 75 kg is 75,000 grams. Because 1 kg is 1000 grams. So mass m is 75,000 grams.

So putting it all together, Q = m * c * ΔT.

So Q = 75,000 g * 1 cal/(g·°C) * 100°C.

Calculating that: 75,000 * 1 * 100 = 7,500,000 calories. Because 75,000 times 100 is 7.5 million calories.

But the question asks for kilocalories. Oh, right, 1 kilocalorie is 1000 calories. So 7,500,000 calories divided by 1000 gives 7500 kilocalories. Wait, 7,500,000 divided by 1000 is 7500. So 7500 kilocalories.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see a 7.5 × 10^3 option. Wait, let me check the options again.

The options are:

A:7.0e3
B:8.0e3
C:7.5e3
D:5.5e3
E:10e3
F:8.5e3
G:6.5e3
H:6e3
I:9.5e3
J:9e3

Oh wait, option C is 7.5 × 10^3 Kcal. So that's exactly what I got. So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait a minute, but let me double-check everything because it's easy to make a mistake in unit conversions.

So let's go through it again.

Dimensions: 2.5 m, 50 cm (0.5 m), 60 mm (0.06 m). Volume is 2.5 * 0.5 * 0.06 = 0.075 m³, which is 75 liters, so 75 kg of water.

Temperature change: 212°F - 32°F = 180°F. Convert to Celsius: 180 * (5/9) = 100°C.

Specific heat of water is 1 cal/g°C. So mass is 75,000 grams.

Q = 75,000 g * 1 cal/g°C * 100°C = 7,500,000 cal = 7500 kcal.

So yes, option C is correct.

To determine how many kilocalories are necessary to heat the water from 32°F to 212°F, we start by calculating the volume of the container. The dimensions are given as 2.5 m × 50 cm × 60 mm. Converting all dimensions to meters:

- **2.5 m** (already in meters),
- **50 cm = 0.5 m**,
- **60 mm = 0.06 m**.

The volume is:

\[
\text{Volume} = 2.5 \, \text{m} \times 0.5 \, \text{m} \times 0.06 \, \text{m} = 0.075 \, \text{m}^3.
\]

Since 1 cubic meter is 1000 liters, the volume in liters is:

\[
0.075 \, \text{m}^3 \times 1000 \, \text{L/m}^3 = 75 \, \text{L}.
\]

The mass of the water is equivalent to its volume in liters because the density of water is approximately \(1 \, \text{kg/L}\). Thus, the mass is:

\[
m = 75 \, \text{kg}.
\]

Next, we calculate the temperature change. The water is heated from 32°F to 212°F, which corresponds to a temperature difference of:

\[
\Delta T = 212 - 32 = 180 \, \text{°F}.
\]

To convert this temperature difference to Celsius, we use the conversion factor \(1 \, \text{°F} = \frac{5}{9} \, \text{°C}\):

\[
\Delta T = 180 \times \frac{5}{9} = 100 \, \text{°C}.
\]

The specific heat capacity of water is \(1 \, \text{cal/(g·°C)}\), and the mass of the water is \(75,000 \, \text{g}\) (since \(1 \, \text{kg} = 1000 \, \text{g}\)). The heat required to raise the temperature of the water is given by:

\[
Q = m \cdot c \cdot \Delta T.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
Q = 75,000 \, \text{g} \times 1 \, \text{cal/(g·°C)} \times 100 \, \text{°C} = 7,500,000 \, \text{cal}.
\]

To convert calories to kilocalories (\(1 \, \text{kcal} = 1000 \, \text{cal}\)):

\[
Q = \frac{7,500,000}{1000} = 7500 \, \text{kcal}.
\]

Thus, the energy required to heat the water is \(7.5 \times 10^3 \, \text{kcal}\). Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C: \(7.5 \times 10^3 \, \text{Kcal}\).**
