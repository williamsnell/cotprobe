Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to calculate the pH of a solution. The given hydrogen ion concentration is 2.7 × 10^-6 M. Hmm, I remember that pH is related to the concentration of hydrogen ions, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Oh right, pH is the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration. So the formula is pH = -log[H+].

Wait, but wait. I've heard that sometimes when the concentration isn't exactly 1e-7, which would make pH 7, you have to calculate it more carefully. So let me think. The hydrogen ion concentration here is 2.7e-6 M. That's higher than 1e-7, so the pH should be less than 7, right? Because lower pH means more acidic, and higher H+ concentration means more acidic.

But wait, when H+ is 1e-7, pH is 7. So if it's higher, like 2.7e-6, pH would be lower. Let's plug it into the formula. So pH = -log(2.7e-6).

Wait, how do I calculate the log of 2.7e-6? I think I can break it down. Log(ab) is log(a) + log(b). So log(2.7e-6) is log(2.7) + log(1e-6). Log(1e-6) is -6, because 10^-6 is 1e-6. So that part is straightforward.

Now, what's log(2.7)? I remember that log(2) is about 0.3010 and log(3) is about 0.4771. Since 2.7 is between 2 and 3, maybe around 0.43? Because 2.7 is closer to 3 than to 2. Let me see: 2^10 is 1024, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can approximate it. Let me think of known log values. Log(2) is 0.3010, log(3) is 0.4771. So 2.7 is 2.7, which is 0.7 of the way from 2 to 3? No, wait, 2.7 is 0.7 greater than 2, but the difference between log(2) and log(3) is about 0.1761.

Wait, perhaps using a linear approximation isn't the best approach. Alternatively, I remember that log(2.7) is approximately 0.4314. I think I've seen that before. So putting it all together: log(2.7e-6) is 0.4314 -6, which is -5.5686.

So pH is -log[H+] which would be -(-5.5686) = 5.5686. So approximately 5.57.

Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I should use a calculator approach. Let's see, 2.7e-6 is 2.7 × 10^-6. Taking the log, which is log(2.7) + log(1e-6). So log(2.7) is about 0.4314, and log(1e-6) is -6. So total log is -5.5686. So pH is 5.5686, which rounds to 5.57.

Looking at the options, option B is 5.57. So the answer should be B.

Alternatively, wait, sometimes I've heard that if the solution is very dilute, activity coefficients might change things, but I think for this problem, it's just a straightforward calculation. So yes, the pH is approximately 5.57.

To calculate the pH of a solution with a hydrogen ion concentration of \( [H^+] = 2.7 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M} \), we use the formula:

\[
\text{pH} = -\log[H^+]
\]

Breaking this down:

1. The logarithm of \( 2.7 \times 10^{-6} \) can be separated as:
   \[
   \log(2.7 \times 10^{-6}) = \log(2.7) + \log(10^{-6})
   \]

2. From known values:
   - \( \log(10^{-6}) = -6 \)
   - \( \log(2.7) \approx 0.4314 \)

3. Adding these together:
   \[
   \log(2.7 \times 10^{-6}) = 0.4314 - 6 = -5.5686
   \]

4. Therefore:
   \[
   \text{pH} = -(-5.5686) = 5.5686
   \]

Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is approximately \( 5.57 \).

From the given options, the correct answer is **B: 5.57**.
