Question:

An entrepreneur from State A decided to sell hot sauce to the public, labeling it ÒBest Hot Sauce.Ó A company incorporated in State B and headquartered in State C sued the entrepreneur in federal court in State C. The complaint sought $50,000 in damages and alleged that the entrepreneur's use of the name ÒBest Hot SauceÓ infringed the company's federal trademark. The entrepreneur filed an answer denying the allegations, and the parties began discovery. Six months later, the entrepreneur moved to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Should the court grant the entrepreneur's motion?

Options:

A: Yes, because although there is diversity, the amount in controversy is not satisfied.
B: No, because the entrepreneur waived the right to chal-lenge subject-matter jurisdiction by not raising the issue initially by motion or in the answer.
C: No, because the company's headquarters are in the same state as the court.
D: Yes, because the complaint is about a product, not a legal matter.
E: No, because the entrepreneur's product is being sold to the public.
F: No, because the entrepreneur has been participating in the case for six months.
G: Yes, because the entrepreneur is not from the same state as the company.
H: Yes, because the entrepreneur is not a resident of the state where the court is located.
I: No, because the company's claim arises under federal law.
J: Yes, because although the claim arises under federal law, the amount in controversy is not satisfied.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about federal court jurisdiction, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's break it down step by step.

The scenario is about an entrepreneur from State A selling hot sauce labeled "Best Hot Sauce." A company from State B, headquartered in State C, sues the entrepreneur in federal court in State C. The complaint is about trademark infringement under federal law and seeks $50,000 in damages.

The entrepreneur moves to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction after six months. The question is whether the court should grant that motion.

First, I remember that federal courts have jurisdiction in two main areas: diversity jurisdiction and federal question jurisdiction. Since the complaint is about a federal trademark, that's a federal question, so 28 U.S.C. § 1331 would apply. Federal question jurisdiction doesn't require a minimum amount in controversy, unlike diversity which requires over $75k. Here, the damages are $50k, which is under that threshold, but since it's a federal issue, the amount doesn't matter. So the court should have jurisdiction under federal question.

Wait, but the options might have some nuances. Let me go through the options.

Option A says yes because diversity is there but amount isn't. Well, maybe if it's a federal question, diversity isn't the basis. So A might not be correct.

Option B says no because the entrepreneur didn't challenge subject-matter jurisdiction initially. I recall that subject-matter jurisdiction can be challenged anytime, even on appeal, because it's about the court's power to hear the case. So if the entrepreneur didn't raise it earlier, it's not waived. So B is incorrect because the motion isn't waived.

Option C says no because company's HQ is same as court. HQ being in State C might relate to venue, not jurisdiction. So C is probably wrong.

Option D says yes because it's a product, not legal matter. No, trademark is a legal issue, so D is wrong.

Option E says no because selling to public. Not sure how that affects jurisdiction. Maybe irrelevant.

Option F says no because entrepreneur participated. Again, subject-matter jurisdiction can't be waived by participation. So F is wrong.

Option G says yes because entrepreneur is not from same state as company. That would relate to diversity jurisdiction, but since it's a federal question, G is incorrect.

Option H: Yes because entrepreneur isn't a resident where court is. Again, that's diversity, not federal question. So H is wrong.

Option I: No because claim arises under federal law. That makes sense because if it's a federal question, jurisdiction is proper regardless of amount. So I is a possible correct answer.

Option J: Yes, though federal law, amount not met. No, because in federal question cases, the amount doesn't matter. So J is wrong.

Wait, so the correct reasoning is that the court has jurisdiction under federal question since the claim is about a federal trademark. The amount in controversy doesn't matter here, so the court shouldn't dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. So the motion should be denied.

Looking back, option I says no because it's a federal law claim, so the court has jurisdiction. That fits. So the answer should be I.

The correct answer is based on the understanding that the court has federal question jurisdiction over the trademark infringement claim. Federal question jurisdiction does not require a minimum amount in controversy, so the entrepreneur's motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction should be denied.

I

Answer: I
