Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm a bit new to the topic, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about X-linked inheritance disorders and which one doesn't show that pattern. Let's break it down.

The question gives me options from A to I, each a different disorder. I need to figure out which one isn't X-linked. I remember that X-linked disorders are those where the responsible gene is located on the X chromosome. Males are more often affected because they have only one X (XY), while females have two (XX), so they'd need both copies to have the disorder.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Haemophilia A. I think Haemophilia is a classic X-linked disorder. It's often called the "royal disease" because it affected some European royal families. So this is X-linked, so it's not the answer.

Option B: Fragile X syndrome. I remember this is the most common cause of inherited intellectual disability. The name comes from the X chromosome appearing fragile when under a microscope. Definitely X-linked, so not the answer.

Option C: Becker muscular dystrophy. Wait, isn't that similar to Duchenne muscular dystrophy? Oh right, both are X-linked. Duchenne is more severe and has an earlier onset. So C is X-linked, not the answer.

Option D: Color blindness. Color vision deficiency is another classic X-linked trait. It's much more common in males because females would need both X chromosomes to have the defective gene. So D is X-linked.

Option E: Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. This one I'm a bit fuzzy on, but I think it's associated with uric acid metabolism. Oh right, it's caused by a deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT). And I recall it's X-linked recessive. So E is X-linked, not the answer.

Option F: Haemophilia B. Also known as Christmas disease. Similar to Haemophilia A, but caused by a deficiency of factor IX instead of factor VIII. Both are X-linked, so F is not the answer.

Option G: Fabry disease. Hmm, I'm not as sure about this one. Fabry's is a lysosomal storage disorder due to alpha-Gal A deficiency. I think it's X-linked, but wait—no, I might be confusing it. Wait, another thought: some sources say it's X-linked recessive. So G is X-linked, so not the answer.

Wait, no, wait. I think I might be getting it mixed up. Let me think again. Fabry disease is caused by mutations in the GLA gene, which is on the X chromosome. So yes, it's X-linked. So G is X-linked, so not the answer.

Option H: Tay-Sachs disease. Okay, I remember Tay-Sachs is an autosomal recessive disorder, not X-linked. Because it's caused by a mutation in the HEXA gene, which is on chromosome 15. So this disorder is inherited in an autosomal manner, meaning both parents must carry the defective gene, and both sexes are equally affected. So H is not X-linked. That must be the answer.

Option I: Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Definitely X-linked, as it's similar to Becker. So I is X-linked.

So the question is asking which does NOT show X-linked inheritance. The only one that isn't X-linked is Tay-Sachs, which is autosomal. So the answer should be H.

The question asks which disorder does not show X-linked inheritance. X-linked disorders are caused by genes located on the X chromosome, and they disproportionately affect males, who have only one X chromosome. Let’s analyze each option:

- **A: Haemophilia A** is a classic X-linked recessive disorder, often called the "royal disease." It is X-linked, so not the answer.  
- **B: Fragile X syndrome** is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability and is caused by a mutation on the X chromosome. It is X-linked, so not the answer.  
- **C: Becker muscular dystrophy** is similar to Duchenne muscular dystrophy and is also X-linked. It is X-linked, so not the answer.  
- **D: Color blindness** is a well-known X-linked trait, much more common in males. It is X-linked, so not the answer.  
- **E: Lesch-Nyhan syndrome** is caused by a mutation in the HPRT gene on the X chromosome and is X-linked recessive. It is X-linked, so not the answer.  
- **F: Haemophilia B** (Christmas disease) is caused by a deficiency of factor IX and is X-linked. It is X-linked, so not the answer.  
- **G: Fabry disease** is caused by mutations in the GLA gene on the X chromosome and is X-linked recessive. It is X-linked, so not the answer.  
- **H: Tay-Sachs disease** is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the HEXA gene on chromosome 15. It is not X-linked, making it the correct answer.  
- **I: Duchenne muscular dystrophy** is X-linked, similar to Becker muscular dystrophy. It is X-linked, so not the answer.  

The only disorder among the options that does not show X-linked inheritance is **Tay-Sachs disease**, as it is autosomal recessive.
