Question:

A lens found in 35 mm cameras has a focal length of 50 mm and a diameter of 25 mm, corresponding to a maximum aperture of (f / 2). The resolution of a lens is commonly expressed as the maximum number of lines per millimeter in the image that can be resolved. If the resolution of the lens is diffraction-limited, approximately what is the resolution in lines per mm? (Good quality 35 mm camera lenses typically have a resolution of the order of 100 [(lines) / mm], determined by surface precision rather than diffraction.)

Options:

A: 200 lines per mm
B: 500 lines per mm
C: 1200 lines per mm
D: 1000 lines per mm
E: 550 lines per mm
F: 350 lines per mm
G: 800 lines per mm
H: 741 lines per mm
I: 650 lines per mm
J: 900 lines per mm

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about camera lenses and their resolution. Hmm, I remember that the resolution of a lens is related to diffraction, especially when it's diffraction-limited. The question gives me some parameters and asks for the maximum number of lines per millimeter the lens can resolve.

Alright, let me start by jotting down the given information. The focal length is 50 mm, and the diameter is 25 mm. The maximum aperture is f/2 because f is 50, so 50 divided by 25 is 2. So the aperture is f/2, which I think is a pretty large aperture, meaning a lot of light comes in but also affects depth of field and resolution.

The problem says the lens is diffraction-limited, so the resolution is determined by the diffraction of light as it passes through the aperture. I remember there's a formula for resolving power, which relates to the maximum number of lines per millimeter (lp/mm) a lens can resolve. I think the formula is something like R = 2 * (aperture diameter) / (wavelength * focal length), but maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, I remember the Rayleigh criterion might come into play here, which uses the concept of the Airy disk.

Wait, another formula comes to mind: the resolving power R is given by R = (2 * D) / (f * λ), where D is the diameter of the lens, f is the focal length, and λ is the wavelength of light. Or wait, maybe R is the maximum number of lines per millimeter, which would be lines/mm. So units might matter here.

Wait, another thought. The formula for the maximum resolution (in lines per millimeter) is often given by R = (2 * N) / (f * λ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think the formula is R = (1.22 * λ) / (f/(D/2)) ) but that's more about the minimum spacing resolved, which would relate to the maximum lines per millimeter.

Wait, perhaps I should recall the standard diffraction limit formula. The resolving power is typically given by the formula R = (2 * f-number) / (λ), but I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, I think the correct formula is the maximum spatial frequency that can be resolved, which is given by R = (2 * D) / (λ * f), but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, the formula might be R = (2 * D) / (f * λ), but I need to get the units straight.

Wait, perhaps it's better to relate it using the angular resolution and then convert to lines per millimeter. The angular resolution θ is given by θ ≈ λ/(D), but θ is in radians. Then, the spatial frequency R (in lines/mm) would be 1/(θ in radians multiplied by the focal length in mm). Because R is the number of lines per millimeter, so R = (1/θ) / (focal length in mm). Wait, no, perhaps R is (1/θ) divided by the focal length in millimeters.

Wait, let me think. The spatial frequency is the inverse of the angle θ times the distance. So θ is λ/D (in radians), so 1/θ = D/λ. So the maximum spatial frequency R is D/(λ * f) ? Hmm, no, maybe R is (D)/(λ * f) but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. The maximum number of lines per millimeter (lp/mm) is given by R = (2 * D) / (λ * f). Wait, because the f-number f-stop is f/D, so f-stop is f/(D/2) = 2f/D. So f-stop is 2f/D. Hmm, but I'm getting myself confused here.

Alternatively, the formula for the diffraction-limited resolution in terms of lines per millimeter is R = (2 * (D/2)) / (λ * f) ) * (2000/π), but I'm not sure where that comes from. Maybe I should look up the exact formula, but since I can't, I'll try to reason it out.

Wait, I remember that the maximum number of lines per millimeter (R) is given by R = (2 * N) / (λ), where N is the f-number. Wait no, because N is f/2 in this case. Hmm.

Wait, the formula I think is R = 1/(θ), where θ is the smallest angle that can be resolved. θ is approximately λ/(D), so R in terms of lines per radian would be D/λ. Then, to get lines per millimeter, I have to multiply by the focal length because each millimeter at the image plane corresponds to an angle of (1 mm)/f. So lines per mm would be R = (D/λ) * (f) / (1 mm). Wait, I'm getting more confused.

Alternatively, the formula for the maximum resolving power in lines per millimeter is given by R = (2 * D * f) / (λ * f^2) )? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, okay, let me try to structure this. The diffraction-limited resolution is when two adjacent points can just be distinguished. The Rayleigh criterion gives the angular resolution θ as θ = 1.22 λ / D, where D is the diameter of the lens. Then, in the image plane, the separation between two points is x = θ * f. So x = (1.22 λ / D) * f.

The maximum number of lines per millimeter would be the inverse of x (since each line is a certain width). But a line pair (one black and one white line) has a width of 2x, so the number of lines per mm would be 1/(2x mm).

Wait, let me clarify. The resolution is often expressed in lines per millimeter, where each line is a cycle of black and white. So each line pair is two lines (black and white). So the number of line pairs per millimeter is 1/(x) where x is the width of a line pair in mm.

Wait, no, wait. The resolution R is the number of lines per millimeter. Each line is a certain width, so the line spacing is 1/R mm. But I'm getting confused between line pairs and lines.

Alternatively, the maximum number of lines (black and white) that can be resolved is R = 1/(x) where x is the minimum spacing between two adjacent lines. So if the minimum resolvable spacing is x, then R is 1/x lines per mm.

But from Rayleigh's formula, the minimum angle θ is 1.22 λ/D. The corresponding spacing on the image plane (at focal length f) is x = θ * f. So x = (1.22 λ f) / D.

So R (lines per mm) is 1/(x mm) = D/(1.22 λ f) * (1/mm). Wait, but x is in mm, so R is D/(1.22 λ f) mm^{-1}.

Wait, let me write that again. x = (1.22 λ f) / D. So x is in mm because f is in mm and λ is in mm? Or wait, λ is in meters? Hmm, I need to get the units right.

Wait, let's assume everything is in mm. So λ would be in mm. Let me pick a wavelength. Visible light is about 550 nm, so 0.00055 mm.

So putting it all together: R = D / (1.22 * λ * f).

Wait, no, because x = (1.22 λ f)/D, so R = 1/x = D/(1.22 λ f).

So R = D/(1.22 λ f).

Now, plugging in the numbers:

D = 25 mm.

f = 50 mm.

λ = 0.00055 mm (since 550 nm = 550e-9 m = 0.55e-3 mm).

So let's compute R:

R = 25 / (1.22 * 0.00055 * 50)

Let me compute the denominator first: 1.22 * 0.00055 = 0.000671.

Then multiply by 50: 0.000671 * 50 = 0.03355.

So R = 25 / 0.03355 ≈ let's calculate that.

25 ÷ 0.03355 ≈ 25 * (1/0.03355) ≈ 25 * 29.78 ≈ 745.5 lines per mm.

Wait, but the options given are H:741, which is close. So the correct answer would be around 740 lines/mm.

But wait, I thought that the resolution was diffraction-limited. But the question mentions that good quality 35mm lenses have a resolution of about 100 lines/mm, determined by surface precision, not diffraction. So perhaps this calculation is not the right approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Because the maximum resolution R in lines/mm is given by R = (2 * D) / (f * λ). Let me check that.

Wait, another approach: the formula for the maximum number of lines per millimeter is R = (2 * D) / (λ * f), where D is the diameter, f is the focal length, and λ is the wavelength.

So D=25 mm, f=50 mm, λ=550 nm = 0.00055 mm.

So R = (2*25) / (0.00055 * 50) = 50 / (0.0275) ≈ 1818 lines/mm. That's way higher than the options given, so that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I have the formula wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, another formula I've come across is R = (1.22 * λ) / (f/(D)) ), which is the same as R = (1.22 * λ * D) / f.

Wait, but that would give R in terms of lines per radian. To convert to lines per mm, you multiply by the focal length, because each mm at the focal plane corresponds to an angle of (1 mm / f) radians.

So R (lines/mm) = (1.22 * λ * D / f) ) * (f / (1 mm)) ) = 1.22 * λ * D / (1 mm).

Wait, that can't be, because units would be meters? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong.

Alternatively, R (lines/mm) is given by 1.22 * (f/D) * (1/λ) )^{-1}?

I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to approach it differently. The f-number is f/2, which is 2 in this case. I remember that the cutoff frequency for a lens is given by (1.22 * λ) / (f-number * wavelength) ) or something like that.

Wait, another thought: the diffraction limit for the maximum number of lines per millimeter is given by R = (2 * N) / (λ), where N is the f-number. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense dimensionally.

Wait, let me think in terms of the angular resolution θ. θ = 1.22 λ / D. Then, the number of lines per radian is 1/θ = D/(1.22 λ). Then, the number of lines per millimeter on the film would be (D/(1.22 λ)) * (1/f) )^{-1} because each millimeter corresponds to an angle of 1/f radians (since tan(theta) ≈ theta for small angles, and tan(theta) = opposite/adjacent = 1 mm / f mm).

Wait, that's a bit convoluted. Let me try to break it down:

θ (radians) = 1.22 λ / D.

The number of lines per radian (lines per angular resolution) is 1/θ = D/(1.22 λ).

Now, the image is formed at the focal plane, so each millimeter on the image corresponds to an angle of (1 mm) / f mm = 1/f radians. So lines per millimeter would be (lines per radian) * (radians per mm) )^{-1}.

Wait, no. Because (lines per radian) is how many lines you can fit into an angle, and (radians per mm) is how many angles fit into a mm. So lines per mm would be (lines per radian) * (radians per mm)^{-1}.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, lines per mm = (lines per radian) * (radians per mm).

Wait, no, because if you have 1 line per radian, and each mm corresponds to 1/f radians, then you have f lines per mm. That doesn't seem right.

Wait, let's think about units. Lines per radian is (lines/radian). To get lines per mm, we need to multiply by (radian per mm). So:

(lines/mm) = (lines/radian) * (radian/mm).

Now, radian/mm is (1/f) because each mm corresponds to an angle of 1/f radians.

So R = (D/(1.22 λ)) * (1/f).

Wait, plug in the numbers:

D = 25 mm,

λ = 550 nm = 0.00055 mm,

f = 50 mm.

So R = (25 / (1.22 * 0.00055)) * (1/50).

First compute 1.22 * 0.00055 = 0.000671.

Then 25 / 0.000671 ≈ 37252.24.

Then multiply by 1/50: 37252.24 * 0.02 ≈ 745 lines/mm.

That's about 745 lines per mm, which is close to option H:741 lines per mm.

So the answer should be H.

To determine the diffraction-limited resolution of the lens in lines per millimeter (lp/mm), we use the formula derived from the Rayleigh criterion. The resolution \( R \) is given by:

\[
R = \frac{D}{1.22 \cdot \lambda \cdot f}
\]

Where:
- \( D \) is the diameter of the lens (25 mm),
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of light (assumed to be 550 nm = \( 0.00055 \, \text{mm} \)),
- \( f \) is the focal length of the lens (50 mm).

### Step 1: Compute the denominator
\[
1.22 \cdot \lambda \cdot f = 1.22 \cdot 0.00055 \cdot 50
\]
\[
1.22 \cdot 0.00055 = 0.000671
\]
\[
0.000671 \cdot 50 = 0.03355
\]

### Step 2: Compute the resolution
\[
R = \frac{D}{1.22 \cdot \lambda \cdot f} = \frac{25}{0.03355} \approx 745 \, \text{lines/mm}
\]

### Step 3: Match the closest option
The calculated resolution is approximately \( 745 \, \text{lines/mm} \), which is closest to option **H: 741 lines/mm**. This aligns with the diffraction-limited resolution of the lens.

### Final Answer:
H
