Okay, so I've got this contract law question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about Tom and Jerry entering into a contract where Tom agrees to sell Jerry $1,000 worth of heroin, which is an illegal substance. The question is asking what type of contract this is, with options from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that contracts can be classified in various ways based on different criteria. Let me think about each option and see which one fits.

First, I need to recall what each term means. Option A is a quasi contract. From what I remember, a quasi contract is when there's no actual agreement between the parties, but a court might impose an obligation based on principles of fairness, like unjust enrichment. But in this case, Tom and Jerry have an agreement, so it's not a quasi contract. So A is probably not the answer.

Option B is a unilateral contract. Unilateral contracts are where only one party makes a promise, and the other party's acceptance is by performing a specific action. For example, "I'll pay you $100 if you mow my lawn." Here, both Tom and Jerry are making promises—Tom to sell, Jerry to buy—so this seems more bilateral. So B might not be right.

Option C is a secondary party beneficiary contract. Beneficiary contracts involve a third party who is intended to benefit from the contract between two others. Like if I contract someone to deliver goods to my friend. But here, there's no third party involved, so C doesn't fit.

Option D is an express contract. Express contracts are those where the terms are explicitly stated, either orally or in writing. Since Tom and Jerry have an explicit agreement about selling heroin, this is an express contract. But wait, I need to think further because the subject matter is illegal, which affects the contract's validity.

Option E is a bilateral contract. That's where both parties exchange promises. Tom promises to sell, Jerry promises to buy. So yes, it's bilateral, but again, the illegality might change how we classify it.

Option F is an implied contract. Implied contracts are based on the parties' conduct rather than explicit terms. Since Tom and Jerry have an express agreement, F doesn't apply.

Option G is a void contract. A void contract is one that is legally unenforceable from the start, often because it involves illegal activities. Since heroin is illegal, this contract can't be enforced. So G seems like a strong possibility.

Option H is a voidable contract. Voidable means the contract is enforceable unless one party chooses to void it, usually because of some defect like misrepresentation or undue influence. But here, the issue is illegality, so it's void, not voidable.

Option I is an unconscionable contract. These are contracts that are so one-sided or unfair that they shock the conscience. While selling illegal drugs is wrong, unconscionability usually refers to the terms being excessively harsh, not necessarily the subject matter being illegal. So I might not be the right choice.

Option J is a contract of adhesion. These are standard form contracts where one party has no real ability to negotiate, like insurance policies. This situation doesn't seem to fit because it's between two parties agreeing to an illegal exchange, so J doesn't apply.

Putting it all together: The contract is between two parties with mutual promises (so express and bilateral), but since the subject matter is illegal, the contract is void. So the answer should be G: void contract.

The contract between Tom and Jerry involves the sale of heroin, an illegal substance. While the agreement is express and bilateral, the illegality of the subject matter renders the contract void from the start.
