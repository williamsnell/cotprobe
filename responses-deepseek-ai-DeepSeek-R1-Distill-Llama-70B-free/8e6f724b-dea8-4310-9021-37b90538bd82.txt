Answer:

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Lotus principle. Hmm, I remember that it's something to do with international law. Let me think. I think the Lotus case was a famous case in international law, maybe from the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) or something like that.

Wait, the Lotus principle, if I recall correctly, has to do with the idea that states are free to act unless prohibited by international law. So it's kind of the opposite of municipal law where you can't do something unless it's allowed. Oh right, in the Lotus case, the court said that restrictions on a state's independence can't be presumed. So the default is that states can do something unless international law explicitly forbids it.

Looking at the options, let me go through them one by one. Option A says customary law is superior to treaty law. I don't think that's the Lotus principle. I remember that's more about the hierarchy of sources, maybe the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties or something else.

Option B is about states intervening in others' internal affairs for national security. No, that sounds more like the non-intervention principle or maybe the Caroline case about self-defense.

Option C says states can apply their own domestic laws in disputes with other states. I'm not sure, but I think that's more about conflict of laws or perhaps state immunity, not the Lotus principle.

Option D mentions international law governing relations between states, not individuals. That's more about the general scope of international law, like how it applies to states, not individuals. Lotus was specifically about the freedom of states unless prohibited.

Option E talks about unlimited jurisdiction over citizens. That's more about nationality jurisdiction, not the Lotus principle.

Option F says states can ignore international law as long as they don't infringe on others' sovereignty. Hmm, that seems similar but I think the Lotus principle is more about the presumption of freedom unless prohibited.

Option G states that restrictions on independence can't be presumed, and whatever isn't prohibited is allowed. That sounds exactly like what I was thinking. So option G looks correct.

Option H is about enforcement jurisdiction on the high seas. Wait, I think the Lotus case did involve a collision on the high seas, but the principle itself is broader than just enforcement. It's about the general principle of state freedom.

Option I is about customary law deriving from state practice and opinio juris. That's correct, but it's a separate concept about the formation of customary law, not the Lotus principle.

Option J is about choosing a court for disputes, which doesn't relate to the Lotus principle.

So the correct answer should be option G, which states the Lotus principle as 'restrictions upon the independence of States cannot therefore be presumed', meaning that states are free to act unless international law prohibits it.
</think>

The Lotus principle, derived from the Lotus case, establishes that states are free to act unless international law explicitly prohibits such action. It emphasizes that restrictions on state independence cannot be presumed, and whatever is not prohibited is permitted. Among the options, G accurately reflects this principle.

Answer: G
