Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

Alright, the question says that in a population of 610 individuals, the gene frequencies of L^M and L^N alleles are 0.62 and 0.38, respectively. I need to calculate the number of individuals with M, MN, and N type blood. The options are given from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that blood types are determined by alleles, and in this case, the system is the MN blood group. The M and N alleles are codominant, so they both show their traits. So the possible phenotypes are M, N, and MN. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, M and N are alleles at the same locus, and since they're codominant, the genotypes would be MM (M type), MN (MN type), and NN (N type).

So, gene frequencies are given. The L^M allele is at 0.62, and L^N is 0.38. So the frequencies are p = 0.62 (for M) and q = 0.38 (for N). Because these are the only two alleles, p + q = 1, which checks out here.

Wait, but wait. In Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the genotype frequencies are p² (homozygous MM), 2pq (heterozygous MN), and q² (homozygous NN). So I can calculate each genotype's frequency and then multiply by the total population to get the number of individuals.

So let's compute each part.

First, p squared is (0.62)^2. Let me calculate that. 0.62 times 0.62: 0.6 * 0.6 is 0.36, 0.6 * 0.02 is 0.012, 0.02 * 0.6 is another 0.012, and 0.02 * 0.02 is 0.0004. So adding all that up: 0.36 + 0.012 + 0.012 + 0.0004 = 0.3844. So p² is 0.3844.

Next, 2pq is 2 * 0.62 * 0.38. Let me compute that. 0.62 * 0.38 is... 0.6 * 0.3 is 0.18, 0.6 * 0.08 is 0.048, 0.02 * 0.3 is 0.006, 0.02 * 0.08 is 0.0016. Adding them up: 0.18 + 0.048 is 0.228, plus 0.006 is 0.234, plus 0.0016 is 0.2356. So 2pq is 2 * 0.2356 = 0.4712.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 2pq is 2 * p * q. So p is 0.62, q is 0.38. So 0.62 * 0.38 = let me compute that more accurately. 62 * 38 is 2356, so moving decimals: 0.62 * 0.38 = 0.2356. So 2 * 0.2356 is 0.4712.

Then q squared is (0.38)^2. Let me compute that. 0.38 * 0.38: 0.3 * 0.3 is 0.09, 0.3 * 0.08 is 0.024, 0.08 * 0.3 is another 0.024, and 0.08 * 0.08 is 0.0064. Adding those up: 0.09 + 0.024 + 0.024 = 0.138 + 0.0064 = 0.1444.

So now, the genotype frequencies are:

- MM (M type): 0.3844
- MN (MN type): 0.4712
- NN (N type): 0.1444

Now, in the population of 610, the number of individuals for each blood type is the frequency multiplied by 610.

Let's compute each:

M type (MM): 610 * 0.3844. Let me compute that.

First, 600 * 0.3844 = 230.64. Then 10 * 0.3844 = 3.844. So total is 230.64 + 3.844 = 234.484. So approximately 234.5. But since we can't have half a person, we'll have to round to the nearest whole number. So that's about 234 or 235.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. 0.3844 * 610. Let me compute it step by step.

0.3844 * 600 = 230.64. 0.3844 *10=3.844. So adding them gives 230.64 +3.844 = 234.484. So 234.484, which is approximately 234 people.

Wait, but perhaps we should carry it to decimals and see how the numbers add up. Maybe the numbers are exact, but let me compute the exact numbers.

Wait, 610 * 0.3844: 610 * 0.3 is 183, 610 *0.08 is 48.8, 610 *0.0044 is let's see, 610 *0.004=2.44, 610*0.0004=0.244. So adding 183 +48.8=231.8, +2.44=234.24, +0.244=234.484. So yes, same as before. So 234.484, rounds to 234 individuals with M type.

Next, MN type is 0.4712 * 610. Let me compute that.

0.4712 * 600 = 282.72, 0.4712 *10=4.712. So 282.72 +4.712 = 287.432. Approximately 287 individuals.

Wait, let me double-check: 610 * 0.4712.

Alternatively, 610 * 0.4 is 244, 610 *0.07 is 42.7, 610 *0.0012 is 0.732. So adding them: 244 +42.7 =286.7 +0.732 = 287.432. So yes, 287.432, which is about 287.

Then, N type (NN) is 0.1444 * 610.

Compute 0.1444 *610:

0.1 *610=61, 0.04*610=24.4, 0.0044*610=2.684.

So 61 +24.4=85.4 +2.684=88.084. So approximately 88 individuals.

Wait, let me compute more accurately: 610 * 0.1444 = ?

Alternatively, 610 * 0.1 =61, 610 *0.04=24.4, 610 *0.004=2.44, 610 *0.0004=0.244.

So 61 +24.4=85.4, +2.44=87.84, +0.244=88.084. So 88.084, which is about 88 individuals.

Now, let's sum these numbers to check if they add up to 610.

234 (M) + 287 (MN) +88 (N) = 234+287=521 +88=609. Wait, but that's 609, but the total is 610. Hmm, so perhaps some rounding is causing the discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps the exact numbers before rounding would sum to 610.

Let me compute each without rounding:

M: 0.3844 *610 = 234.484, which I'll keep as 234.484.

MN: 0.4712 *610= 287.432.

N: 0.1444 *610= 88.084.

Adding them together: 234.484 + 287.432 = 521.916, plus 88.084 gives 610 exactly. So when we round each to the nearest whole number, the total would be 234 +287 +88 = 609, but perhaps one of them is actually 235, which would make the sum 610.

Wait, perhaps I should round each correctly. Let's look at the decimal parts:

M: 234.484 → 0.484, which is less than 0.5, so rounds down to 234.

MN: 287.432 → 0.432, rounds down to 287.

N: 88.084 → 0.084, rounds down to 88.

Wait, but that gives 234+287=521, +88=609. Hmm, one short of 610.

So perhaps one of them should be rounded up. Maybe the MN count is 287.432, which is closer to 287 than 288. So perhaps the M count was 234.484, which would be 234. But perhaps when I calculated, the exact numbers would be such that the sum is 610. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the more precise approach.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects us to use the exact genotype frequencies multiplied by population, and then rounded to the nearest whole number. So perhaps the correct counts are 234 M, 287 MN, and 88 N, but that adds up to 609. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me double-check the H-W calculations.

Wait, p is 0.62, q is 0.38.

p squared is 0.62^2 = 0.3844.

q squared is 0.38^2 = 0.1444.

2pq is 2 * 0.62 * 0.38 = 0.4712.

So genotype frequencies are correct.

Hmm, but when I multiply each by 610, the sum should be exactly 610, because each individual is counted once.

Wait, let me see:

0.3844 *610 = 234.484

0.4712 *610 = 287.432

0.1444 *610 = 88.084

Adding these: 234.484 +287.432 = 521.916 +88.084 = 610. So the exact numbers add up to 610. So the issue is that when rounding to the nearest integer, the sum is 609. So perhaps one of them should be rounded up.

But which one? The usual approach is to round each to the nearest integer. So:

M: 234.484 → 234

MN: 287.432 → 287

N: 88.084 → 88

But 234 + 287 +88 = 609, so one is missing. Therefore, perhaps the MN count is actually 288 instead of 287, but that's only if we round up based on decimal parts.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact fractional parts to decide. Wait, 234.484 is approximately 234.48, which is closer to 234. So maybe the correct approach is to accept that the rounding causes a loss of one individual, but perhaps the question expects us to proceed with the rounded numbers.

Wait, looking at the options, let's see what each option gives in terms of M, MN, and N.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 238 M, 292 MN, 80 N → sum 238+292=530 +80=610. So that's correct.

Option B: 230 M, 295 MN,85 →230+295=525+85=610.

Option C:260,260,90 → sum 260+260=520+90=610.

Option D:220,300,90 → 220+300=520+90=610.

Option E:225,310,75 → 225+310=535+75=610.

Option F:255,270,85 → sum 255+270=525+85=610.

Option G:245,275,90 → sum 245+275=520+90=610.

Option H:235,287,88 → sum 235+287=522+88=610.

Option I:250,280,80 → 250+280=530+80=610.

Option J:240,290,80 → 240+290=530+80=610.

So all options sum to 610, which makes sense.

Now, looking at my calculation:

M: 234.48 → 234

MN:287.43 →287

N:88.08 →88.

So the closest option would be H: 235 M, 287 MN, 88 N. Because 235 is close to 234.48 (rounded up), 287, and 88. So option H.

Wait, but option H's M count is 235, which is just 0.48 above 234, so it's rounded up. Similarly, the N is 88, which matches.

So looking at option H: 235 M, 287 MN, 88 N. But let's check the options again.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

A: 238 M, 292 MN, 80 N → No.

B:230 M, 295 MN,85 → No.

C:260,260,90 → No.

D:220,300,90 → No.

E:225,310,75 → No.

F:255,270,85 → No.

G:245,275,90 → No.

H:235,287,88 → Yes, this matches.

I:250,280,80 → No.

J:240,290,80 → No.

So option H is the one with 235 M, 287 MN, 88 N.

Wait, but let me double-check my numbers. Because in my calculation, M is 234.484, which is approximately 234. So perhaps the correct option is H, which has 235, but that's a bit confusing.

Alternatively, maybe I miscalculated the initial genotype frequencies. Let me compute them again to be sure.

p = 0.62 → p² = 0.62 * 0.62 = 0.3844.

q = 0.38 → q² = 0.38 * 0.38 = 0.1444.

2pq = 2 * 0.62 * 0.38 = 0.4712.

Yes, that's correct.

So 0.3844 *610 = 234.484 → 234 when rounded down.

0.4712 *610 = 287.432 → 287.

0.1444 *610 =88.084 →88.

So the expected counts are 234 M, 287 MN, 88 N. So when I look at the options, option H is 235,287,88. So that's the closest.

But let me check the options again. Option H says 235 M, 287 MN, 88 N. So that's exactly my calculation except M is 235 instead of 234. Maybe because when rounding, 234.484 is closer to 234, but perhaps the exact number when multiplied gives 234.484, which could be 234 or 235 depending on whether we're rounding or taking the integer part.

Wait, but perhaps the question expects us to use the exact numbers without rounding until the end. Let me think: when you have 234.484, you can't have 0.484 of a person, so you round to 234. Similarly for the others.

But then why is option H 235? Maybe I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question assumes that the allele frequencies are exactly 0.62 and 0.38, so the genotype frequencies are exactly p², 2pq, q².

But maybe I should calculate the exact numbers without rounding the intermediate steps.

Wait, let me compute 610 * 0.3844 exactly.

0.3844 *610: Let's compute 3844 *610 /10000.

3844 *610 = ?

Wait, that's a bit time-consuming, but perhaps I can compute it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to just proceed with the original calculation and select the option that matches.

So according to my calculation, the numbers are approximately 234 M, 287 MN, 88 N, which isn't exactly any of the options, except option H, which is 235, 287, 88.

Wait, but maybe I should check the options more carefully.

Wait, option H is 235 M, 287 MN, 88 N. That's exactly my MN count of 287.432, which rounds to 287, and N count of 88.084, which rounds to 88. So the only difference is M being 235 instead of 234.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the M count. Let me compute 0.3844 *610 again.

0.3844 *610:

Let me compute 610 * 0.3 = 183

610 *0.08 =48.8

610 *0.004=2.44

610 *0.0004=0.244.

Adding these:

183 +48.8 =231.8

231.8 +2.44 =234.24

234.24 +0.244 =234.484.

So yes, 234.484, which is approximately 234. So why is option H 235? Unless I have a mistake in the initial allele frequencies.

Wait, perhaps the question was about L^M and L^N, but maybe I have to account for the fact that these are the only alleles, so the calculations are correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the MN blood group system, where the possible phenotypes are M, MN, and N, and the genotypes are MM (M), MN (MN), and NN (N). So the approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps the option H is correct because 234.484 is closer to 234, but perhaps in the question, due to rounding during calculations, the M count is 235. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact numbers without intermediate rounding.

Wait, but maybe the correct counts are 234, 287, and 89, but that would make the sum 610.

Wait, 234 +287 =521, +89=610. So perhaps I should check if any option has 234,287,89. But looking at the options, none have that.

Hmm, perhaps I should check each option's M count.

Wait, let me compute the exact expected M count: 610 * 0.3844 = 234.484, which is approximately 234.5, so rounds to 234
