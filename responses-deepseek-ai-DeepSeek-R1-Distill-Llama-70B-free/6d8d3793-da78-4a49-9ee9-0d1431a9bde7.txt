Question:

On Thursday, March 7, an owner's home was destroyed by fire. The owner's house was insured against such fire loss by an insurance company. According to the policy contract, the insured was required to notify the insurance company within 10 days following any loss due to fire or other catastrophe. The owner sued the insurance company to recover $750,000, which was the face amount that his home was insured for. The insurance company admitted that the owner's house was insured for that amount, though the company denied liability because it claimed that it had not received notice of the fire within the 10-day period as required by the policy. At trial, the owner calls his bookkeeper to testify. The bookkeeper proposes to testify that on March 11, the owner handed her an envelope and told her it contained a notice form for the insurance company, and that she mailed the envelope on his behalf. If the bookkeeper intends to establish that the envelope that the owner handed her contained the notice of fire loss, her proposed testimony is

Options:

A: admissible, because the owner's statement to her is non-hearsay.
B: inadmissible, as the bookkeeper's testimony is considered second-hand information.
C: admissible, because a letter properly mailed is presumed received in due course.
D: inadmissible, because it is the responsibility of the owner, not the bookkeeper, to ensure the insurance company received the notice.
E: inadmissible, because the owner's statement to the bookkeeper is not the best evidence.
F: admissible, as the bookkeeper's testimony provides proof of the owner's attempt to notify the insurance company.
G: inadmissible, because the owner's statement to the bookkeeper is hearsay not within any exception.
H: inadmissible, because the bookkeeper cannot confirm the contents of the envelope.
I: admissible, because the owner's statement is considered a verbal act.
J: admissible, because the bookkeeper is a credible witness.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with hearsay and exceptions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is about an insurance case. The owner's house was destroyed by fire on March 7th. The insurance policy requires the insured to notify the company within 10 days. The owner is suing to recover $750k, and the insurance company is denying liability because they claim they didn't receive the notice in time.

At the trial, the owner calls his bookkeeper. She testifies that on March 11th, the owner gave her an envelope saying it contained a notice form for the insurance company, and she mailed it. The question is whether her testimony is admissible to establish that the envelope had the notice.

So, the issue is whether the bookkeeper's testimony about what the owner told her is admissible. The owner's statement to the bookkeeper is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted—that the envelope contained the notice. That sounds like hearsay because it's someone's statement outside of court being used to prove the contents of the envelope.

Wait, but are there any exceptions? Let me think. One possible exception is the "verbal act" doctrine. Sometimes, when the statement's purpose is to affect the legal rights or duties, it's admissible. Alternatively, statements that are part of the routine business operations might be admissible under the business records exception, but I don't think that applies here because the statement is about a specific event.

Another thought: if the statement is about the then-existing state of mind or emotion, but that doesn't fit here. The owner's statement was about the contents of the envelope, which is a present-sense impression. Wait, present-sense exception is for statements made contemporaneously with an event. But here, the owner is making the statement on March 11th, and the event (mailing the notice) is the same day. Hmm, maybe that's a stretch.

Alternatively, the statement could be considered a "verbal act" because it's part of the act of mailing the notice. The owner's statement that the envelope contains the notice is part of the act of mailing it, so it's not hearsay. I think this is the verbal act exception. So the statement is admissible as a verbal act because it's part of the action being performed (mailing the notice), and it's not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted in the statement itself but as part of the act.

Wait, no—actually, the purpose here is to prove that the envelope contained the notice, so it's being offered for the truth. So that doesn't fit the verbal act exception because that exception applies when the statement itself is the act, like a promise or a declaration.

Wait, maybe the present-sense impression? The owner's statement was made while he was handing over the envelope. So that could be a present-sense impression under FRE 803(1), which doesn't require a declaration against interest. So if the statement describes an event made while the event was occurring and immediately thereafter, it's admissible.

But the event here is the owner handing the envelope, so the statement about the contents is made as he's handing it over. That might fit as a present-sense impression. Alternatively, is it an excited utterance? Probably not, unless there's some stress related to the fire, but that's not indicated here.

Another angle: the best evidence rule. The bookkeeper is testifying about the contents of the envelope. The best evidence rule says that to prove the contents of a writing, the original is preferred. But if the original is lost or unobtainable, secondary evidence can be used. Here, maybe the notice itself is the best evidence, but the bookkeeper didn't see it. So her testimony about the owner's statement might not be the best evidence. But wait, the owner's statement is hearsay, and without an exception, it's inadmissible. So the best evidence rule issue might not be the main problem here.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Admissible because the owner's statement is non-hearsay. I don't think so because it's an out-of-court statement offered for truth.

Option B: Inadmissible as second-hand. Maybe, but if there's an exception, it could be admissible.

Option C: Admissible because mailed is presumed received. That's a different issue—whether the mailing leads to presumption of delivery, but the question is about the contents of the envelope, not whether it was received.

Option D: Inadmissible, responsibility on owner. That's about the merits, not admissibility.

Option E: Inadmissible as not best evidence. The owner's statement is about the contents, but the best evidence would be the document itself. So without the document, her testimony is secondary. But does that make it inadmissible, or just less preferable? I think it's still admissible as secondary evidence if the original isn't available. But I'm not sure if that's the main issue here.

Option F: Admissible as proof of attempt to notify. It's about the owner's attempt, but the statement is still hearsay.

Option G: Inadmissible as hearsay with no exception. That seems possible if no exception applies.

Option H: Inadmissible because she can't confirm contents. That's a factual issue—she can testify what the owner said, even if she didn't see inside. So her testimony is about the owner's statement, not her knowledge.

Option I: Admissible as a verbal act. If the statement is part of the act of mailing, maybe. But I'm not sure.

Option J: Admissible because credible. Credibility affects weight, not admissibility.

So, the main issue is whether the owner's statement is hearsay and if any exception applies.

If the statement is hearsay and no exception applies, then it's inadmissible. So which option says that? Option G says it's inadmissible as hearsay not within any exception.

But wait, could it be a present-sense impression? The owner's statement was made as he was handing the envelope. So under FRE 803(1), a present-sense impression is admissible. So the statement describes an event (the contents) made while the event was occurring. That would make it admissible as a present-sense impression, so it's not barred by hearsay.

Wait, but the event is the act of mailing the notice. The statement explains what's happening at the time. So yes, that could fit.

Alternatively, the statement could be part of a business record, but I don't think so because it's a one-time event.

So if it's a present-sense impression, the testimony is admissible. So looking at the options, which one reflects that?

Option F says it's admissible as proof of attempt, but that doesn't directly address hearsay.

Wait, another angle: the statement is not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted, but to show the owner's state of mind—like that he believed he was mailing the notice. But no, the purpose here is to establish that the envelope contained the notice, so it is for the truth.

So, the statement is hearsay. Is there an exception? Present-sense impression would apply if the statement was made contemporaneously with the event. Here, the event is the owner placing the notice in the envelope and handing it to the bookkeeper. So the statement was made at that time.

Therefore, the bookkeeper's testimony about the owner's statement is admissible under the present-sense impression exception. So which option reflects that?

Looking back at the options, I don't see an option that directly mentions present-sense impression. Let's check each option again.

Option A: Non-hearsay. No, it's hearsay.

Option F: Admissible as proof of attempt. That's more about the owner's intent, but the statement is still hearsay.

Option I: Verbal act. Maybe, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the owner's statement is not hearsay because it's a statement by a party opponent. But the owner is the plaintiff, so his statement to the bookkeeper wouldn't be a statement by a party opponent unless the bookkeeper is the opponent, which she's not.

Alternatively, the statement could be admissible as a statement of a party—under FRE 801(d)(2), but that requires the statement to be offered against the party, which is the owner here. So that wouldn't apply.

Wait, the owner is the plaintiff, and this is his statement. So using his own statement against himself? No, because he's the one offering it. So that exception wouldn't help.

So back to present-sense impression. If that's applicable, then the testimony is admissible, but none of the options directly state that. Let me review the options again.

Option A: Admissible, non-hearsay. No.

Option F: Admissible, attempt to notify. So the bookkeeper's testimony is about the owner's attempt, which would be relevant. But the statement is still hearsay unless an exception applies.

Wait, perhaps the statement is admissible under the mail box rule or something else. No, that's about when a letter is deemed received.

Wait, perhaps it's not hearsay because the statement is about the contents, but the statement is being used to show the owner's intent to mail the notice, not the actual contents. No, because the point is to establish that the envelope had the notice.

Alternatively, maybe the statement is a statement against interest, but the owner's statement isn't against his interest.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is G: inadmissible as hearsay with no exception.

Wait, but I thought present-sense impression applies. Let me think again. The owner's statement was made as he was handing the envelope, so it's contemporaneous. So it's a present-sense impression, thus admissible under 803(1). So the testimony is admissible.

Looking at the options, which one says it's admissible because of present-sense impression? There's no option that mentions that. So perhaps the correct answer is F: admissible as proof of attempt.

But option F doesn't address the hearsay issue. Alternatively, perhaps the owner's statement is non-hearsay because it's a verbal act. Wait, the verbal act doctrine applies when the statement is the act itself, like a promise. Here, the statement is part of the act of mailing, so it's a verbal act. Therefore, it's not hearsay.

So if the statement is a verbal act, it's admissible. Looking at the options, option I says it's admissible because the owner's statement is a verbal act.

So option I would be correct.

But I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to clarify.

The verbal act exception applies when the statement is the act itself. For example, when someone says, "I promise to pay," it's a verbal act. In this case, the owner's statement that the envelope contains the notice is part of the act of mailing it. So the statement isn't hearsay because it's not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, but as part of the act.

Wait, no. If the purpose is to show that the envelope contained the notice, then it's being offered for the truth. So it's hearsay. Therefore, the verbal act exception wouldn't apply.

So, going back, the statement is hearsay, and unless an exception applies, it's inadmissible. The possible exceptions are present-sense impression or business records.

If the statement was made while the event was happening, then present-sense applies. So the bookkeeper's testimony about the owner's statement would be admissible as a present-sense impression.

But none of the options explicitly mention that. So looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is F: admissible as proof of attempt.

Wait, but F is about the owner's attempt to notify. The bookkeeper's testimony would show the owner gave her the envelope to mail, which is an attempt. But the contents are still at issue.

Alternatively, the statement may not be hearsay because it's a statement of a then-existing mental state. But I don't think that applies here because the statement is about the contents of the envelope, not the owner's state of mind.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. The owner's statement is hearsay. To be admissible, it must fall under an exception.

The best fit seems to be the present-sense impression under FRE 803(1). So the testimony is admissible, making option F incorrect because it doesn't address hearsay, but perhaps option A is wrong because it's hearsay.

Wait, option F says it's admissible as proof of the owner's attempt. The statement is about the contents, but the attempt is a separate issue. So the bookkeeper's testimony could be used to show the owner's attempt to mail the notice, but not necessarily the contents. But the question is about the contents.

Hmm, perhaps the answer is option H: inadmissible because she can't confirm the contents. But she's testifying based on the owner's statement, which is hearsay. So unless an exception applies, it's inadmissible.

So, in the end, I think the correct answer is G: inadmissible because it's hearsay without an exception.
</think>

The question revolves around the admissibility of the bookkeeper's testimony regarding the owner's statement that the envelope contained a notice of fire loss. The owner's statement is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (that the envelope contained the notice), which makes it hearsay. For the testimony to be admissible, an exception to the hearsay rule must apply.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**: Incorrect. The owner's statement is hearsay because it is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted.

2. **Option B**: Incorrect. While the testimony may be second-hand, the issue is whether it qualifies under a hearsay exception, not whether it is second-hand.

3. **Option C**: Incorrect. The presumption of receipt applies to whether the envelope was delivered, not to the contents of the envelope.

4. **Option D**: Incorrect. This addresses the owner's responsibility to notify the insurance company, which is a substantive issue, not a matter of admissibility.

5. **Option E**: Incorrect. The best evidence rule requires the original document to prove its contents, but secondary evidence (like the bookkeeper's testimony) can still be admissible if the original is unavailable.

6. **Option F**: Incorrect. While the testimony might show the owner's attempt to notify the insurance company, the statement is still hearsay and requires an exception to be admissible.

7. **Option G**: Correct. The owner's statement is hearsay, and no exception (such as present-sense impression or verbal act) applies to make it admissible. Without an exception, the testimony is inadmissible.

8. **Option H**: Incorrect. The bookkeeper's inability to confirm the contents of the envelope goes to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.

9. **Option I**: Incorrect. The verbal act doctrine applies when the statement itself is the act (e.g., a promise), but here the statement is being used to prove the contents of the envelope, making it hearsay.

10. **Option J**: Incorrect. Credibility affects the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.

### Conclusion:
The owner's statement to the bookkeeper is hearsay, and no exception applies to make it admissible. Therefore, the bookkeeper's testimony is inadmissible. The correct answer is:

**G: inadmissible, because the owner's statement to the bookkeeper is hearsay not within any exception.**
