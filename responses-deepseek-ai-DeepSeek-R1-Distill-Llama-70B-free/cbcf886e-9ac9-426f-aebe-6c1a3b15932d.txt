Okay, so I've got this problem here about insurance policies and calculating their premiums. Hmm, let's see what I can figure out. I remember that when calculating insurance premiums, you usually take the policy's face value and multiply it by the premium rate, but I might be missing something. Let me think through each policy one by one.

So, the problem gives me three policies with their face values, premium rates, and terms. The rates are given per $100, so I think that means for every $100 of the face value, you pay the premium rate. Oh right, and the term is how long the policy is for. Wait, does the term affect the calculation? Like, is the premium per year or total? I think the term here is the duration, so if the rate is annual, then the term would multiply the annual premium.

Wait, looking at the data:

Policy 1: Face $9,000, rate $.28 per $100, term 1 year.
Policy 2: Face $52,000, rate $.35 per $100, term 3 years.
Policy 3: Face $28,000, rate $.42 per $100, term 1 year.

So for each policy, the premium would be (Face Value / 100) * Rate * Term.

Wait, no, wait. Wait a second. Let me clarify the formula. The rate is per $100 of coverage per year. So the annual premium is (Face Value / 100) * Rate. Then, if the term is more than a year, multiply by the number of years. Alternatively, if the rate is per year, you have to multiply by the term.

So the formula should be: Premium = (Face Value / 100) * Rate * Term.

Wait, let me test that. For Policy 1, Face is $9,000. So 9000/100 = 90. Rate is 0.28 per year, term is 1 year. So 90 * 0.28 = 25.2. So Policy 1's premium is $25.20.

Wait, but looking at the options, some have Policy 1 as $25.20, like option D, I, J. Others have $28 or $52. So I think I'm correct so far.

Next, Policy 2: Face is $52,000. 52000/100 = 520. Rate is 0.35 per year, term is 3 years. So 520 * 0.35 = 182 per year. Then multiply by 3 years: 182 * 3 = 546. So Policy 2's premium is $546.00.

Hmm. Then Policy 3: Face $28,000. 28000/100 is 280. Rate is 0.42 per year, term 1 year. So 280 * 0.42 = 117.60. So Policy 3 is $117.60.

Wait, but now let's look at the options.

Looking for Policy 1: $25.20, Policy 2: $546.00, Policy 3: $117.60.

Looking at the options:

Option J: Policy 1 $25.20, Policy 2 $546.00, Policy 3 $117.60. That matches what I calculated.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.

Policy 1: 9000 /100 =90. 90 * 0.28 =25.2. Correct.

Policy 2: 52000/100=520. 520 *0.35= 182 per year. 182 *3=546. Correct.

Policy3: 28000/100=280. 280 *0.42= 117.6. Correct.

So Option J is the right answer. Let me check the options again.

Option J says:

Policy 1: $25.20,

Policy 2: $546.00,

Policy3: $117.60.

Yes, that's exactly what I got. So the correct answer should be J.

Wait, but let me glance at the other options to make sure. Let's see:

Option B: Policy2 is 546, but Policy1 is 28. So no.

Option D: Policy2 491.40, which is not what I calculated.

Option I: Policy2 182, which is the annual, not total for 3 years.

So J is the only one that matches all three calculations.

To calculate the premiums for the given insurance policies, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Premium} = \left(\frac{\text{Face Value}}{100}\right) \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Term}
\]

### Policy 1:
- Face Value: $9,000
- Rate: $0.28 per $100 per year
- Term: 1 year  
\[
\text{Premium} = \left(\frac{9,000}{100}\right) \times 0.28 \times 1 = 25.20
\]

### Policy 2:
- Face Value: $52,000
- Rate: $0.35 per $100 per year
- Term: 3 years  
\[
\text{Premium} = \left(\frac{52,000}{100}\right) \times 0.35 \times 3 = 546.00
\]

### Policy 3:
- Face Value: $28,000
- Rate: $0.42 per $100 per year
- Term: 1 year  
\[
\text{Premium} = \left(\frac{28,000}{100}\right) \times 0.42 \times 1 = 117.60
\]

### Matching with Options:
- **Policy 1:** $25.20
- **Policy 2:** $546.00
- **Policy 3:** $117.60  

The only option that matches these calculations is **Option J**.
