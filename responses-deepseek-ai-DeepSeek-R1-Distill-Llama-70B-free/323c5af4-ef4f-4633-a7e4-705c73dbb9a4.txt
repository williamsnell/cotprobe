Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the Supreme Court's balance between the establishment clause and the free-exercise clause. I'm a bit rusty on my constitutional law, but I'll try to think this through.

First, I remember that the establishment clause is part of the First Amendment, which says that the government can't establish an official religion. So the government should stay neutral. On the other hand, the free-exercise clause protects people's right to practice their religion without undue interference.

The question is asking which option best describes how the Supreme Court has balanced these two. So I need to think about the key cases and what the Court has ruled.

I recall the Lemon Test from the case Lemon v. Kurtzman. The test has three prongs: purpose, effect, and entanglement. The purpose must be secular, the effect must not advance or inhibit religion, and it shouldn't cause excessive government entanglement with religion. If a law or policy fails any of these, it's unconstitutional under the establishment clause.

Another important case is Engel v. Vitale, where the Court ruled that state-sponsored prayer in public schools is unconstitutional. So that's an establishment clause issue because it's the government imposing religion.

But then there's cases like Tinker v. Des Moines, which is more about free speech, but also touches on student rights. Wait, no—Tinker was about armbands protesting the Vietnam War, not religion. Hmm.

Wait, I think about the free-exercise clause cases. Like in Yoder v. Wisconsin, the Court ruled that Amish parents could homeschool their children beyond the compulsory age because it was their religious practice. So the Court allowed more freedom in practicing religion even if it meant not following a state law.

So the balance seems to be that the government can't support a religion (establishment), but it must allow people to practice their religion freely, even if that means accommodating certain practices that might otherwise be restricted.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The government can restrict the free exercise of religion in the interest of national security. I'm not sure about this. The Court has allowed some restrictions, but national security is a big claim. Maybe in extreme cases, but I'm not sure if that's the main balance point.

Option B: Freedom of speech is protected except in certain situations, such as yelling "fire" in a crowded theater. Wait, that's about free speech, not religion clauses, so probably not the answer.

Option C: All religious practices are prohibited in public schools. No, that doesn't sound right. Some practices are allowed, like a moment of silence or voluntary prayer groups. It's the school-sponsored prayer that's prohibited.

Option D: The government can endorse a specific religion as long as it doesn't compel people to practice it. That sounds against the establishment clause. The government shouldn't endorse any religion, regardless of compulsion.

Option E: Once a church has tax-exempt status, it can't be revoked. I don't think that's correct. Tax-exempt status can be revoked if the organization doesn't comply with the rules, like engaging in too much political activity.

Option F: Government can fund religious activities as long as all religions are given equal opportunities. This might relate to the Lemon Test. If funding is available to all religions without favoring any, maybe it's allowed. But I'm not sure if this is the best balance point.

Option G: Government can promote a specific religion as long as it doesn't interfere with others. That seems to violate the establishment clause because promoting any religion is problematic.

Option H: Once Congress creates an agency, it can only be dissolved by constitutional amendment. That's unrelated to the religion clauses, so not the answer.

Option I: State-sponsored prayer during school hours is prohibited, but voluntary prayer by student groups before school is allowed. This rings a bell. The Court has indeed ruled that while schools can't have official prayers, students can have their own voluntary groups, like prayer clubs, before or after school. So this seems to balance both clauses—preventing establishment but allowing free exercise.

Option J: The government can neither endorse nor restrict any religious activities. That's too broad. The government can't endorse, but it can have some restrictions on free exercise when there's a compelling interest, like in Yoder, but maybe more accurately, when it's the least restrictive means.

So the correct answer seems to be I. It reflects the Court's stance that while the government can't impose religion (state-sponsored prayer), individuals can practice freely, such as in student-led groups.

The correct answer is **I**. The Supreme Court has consistently struck a balance between the establishment clause and the free-exercise clause by ensuring that the government does not endorse or establish a specific religion, while also protecting individuals' rights to freely practice their religion. For example, state-sponsored prayer during school hours is prohibited under the establishment clause, as seen in *Engel v. Vitale*. However, voluntary prayer by student groups before school is allowed, as it falls under the protection of the free-exercise clause. This reflects the Court's approach of preventing government endorsement of religion while accommodating religious practices.
