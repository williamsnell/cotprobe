Okay, so I've got this problem here about heat transfer in a carbon steel plate. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I remember that when an electrical current flows through a material, it generates heat due to electrical resistance. This is called ohmic heating or resistive heating. The question says that the heat loss from the end surfaces is neglected, so I don't have to worry about heat escaping from the ends. Also, the heat generation is uniform across the section, which probably simplifies things.

The plate's dimensions are given: 1/2 inch thick, 4 inches wide, and 2.5 feet long. Oh wait, I should convert all measurements to the same units. Since the thermal conductivity k is given in Btu/hr-ft-°F, I think it's best to work in feet and inches converted to feet maybe. Let me see, 1/2 inch is 0.041667 feet (since 1 inch is 0.08333 feet), and 4 inches is 0.33333 feet. The length is 2.5 feet.

The potential applied is 12 volts. Resistivity rho is 1.25e-4 ohm-ft. Thermal conductivity k is 2.8 Btu/hr-ft-°F. The temperature at the lateral faces (edges) is 1500°F, and I need to find the temperature at the center.

I think this is a steady-state heat conduction problem with internal heat generation. Oh right, the heat equation for this scenario would be the Poisson equation in 2D maybe? But wait, the plate is flat, and the current flows along its length. So the plate is like a rectangular prism, long in the direction of current flow.

Wait, how does the current flow? It goes along the length, which is the 2.5 ft dimension. So the current's direction is along the length. The cross-section is thickness (1/2 in) by width (4 in). But the problem says heat loss from end surfaces is neglected, so we don't have to consider heat loss from the ends of the length, only from the lateral surfaces (the sides).

Wait, no. Wait, the plate is 2.5 ft long. The lateral faces would be the four sides of the plate. Oh wait, the plate is a flat plate, so it's probably a rectangle when viewed from above. So the plate's dimensions are length 2.5 ft, width 4 inches (0.333 ft), and thickness 0.5 inches (0.04167 ft). But when the current flows along the length, the cross-section is width by thickness.

So the problem is probably symmetric across the width and thickness. But the heat loss is from the lateral faces, which I guess are the two longer sides (the 4 inch by 2.5 ft faces) and the two shorter sides (0.5 inch by 2.5 ft faces). Wait, but the problem says the temperature of the lateral faces is 1500°F. Hmm, perhaps the lateral faces are the two wider faces, meaning the 4 inch by 2.5 ft faces. So the edges along the length, the 0.5 inch edges, are at a different temperature?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me read the question again. Oh, it says the temperature of the lateral faces is 1500°F. So the lateral faces are the ones along the length. So the plate is 2.5 ft long, and the lateral faces are the two 4 in by 2.5 ft sides and the two 0.5 in by 2.5 ft sides. Wait, but in the problem, is the plate considered as 2D? Because maybe the heat transfer is only significant in one direction, like across the thickness.

Wait, perhaps the plate is treated as a 2D problem, and the temperature varies across the cross-section (width and thickness). But if the plate is very long (2.5 ft), and the ends don't lose heat, the heat conduction would be in the cross-sectional plane, which is a rectangle 0.333 ft wide and 0.04167 ft thick.

Alternatively, perhaps the plate's thickness is much smaller than its width, so the temperature variation is mainly across the thickness. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the heat generation. The resistive heating per unit volume would be (I^2 R)/V, but since the resistivity is given, maybe I should compute the current first.

Wait, to find the electrical resistance of the plate. The formula for resistance is R = rho * (L / A), where L is the length and A is the cross-sectional area. The cross-section area A is thickness * width. So A = 0.5 in * 4 in. But I need to convert inches to feet. So 0.5 inches is 0.04167 ft, 4 inches is 0.3333 ft. So A = 0.04167 ft * 0.3333 ft = approx 0.01389 ft².

Wait, wait, 0.5 inches is 0.04167 ft, 4 inches is 0.33333 ft. So yes, A = 0.04167 * 0.33333 = approx 0.0138889 ft².

Then the resistance R is rho * (L/A). Rho is 1.25e-4 ohm-ft. L is 2.5 ft. So R = (1.25e-4 ohm-ft) * (2.5 ft) / (0.0138889 ft²) = let's compute that.

R = 1.25e-4 * 2.5 / 0.0138889.

Calculating numerator: 1.25e-4 * 2.5 = 3.125e-4.

Denominator: 0.0138889 ≈ 0.013889.

So R ≈ 3.125e-4 / 0.013889 ≈ let's compute: 3.125e-4 is 0.0003125. 0.0003125 / 0.013889 ≈ 0.0225 ohms.

Wait, because 0.013889 is approx 1/72 (since 1/72 ≈ 0.01389). So 0.0003125 * 72 = 0.0225. So R ≈ 0.0225 ohms.

Power generated is V²/R. Voltage is 12 volts. So P = 12^2 / 0.0225 = 144 / 0.0225 = let's compute that. 144 / 0.0225 = (144 * 100000)/22500? No, wait, 0.0225 is 225e-4. So 144 / 0.0225 = (144 * 10000) / 225 = (1440000)/225.

Calculating that: 225 * 6400 = 1,440,000 (since 225 * 6000=1,350,000; 225*400=90,000 → 1,440,000). So 1440000 /225 = 6400. So P = 6400 watts? Wait, no, because the unit for resistivity is ohm-ft, and the calculations, but wait, let me think: the units might not be correct. Wait, R is in ohms, V in volts, so power is in watts (joules per second). But the thermal conductivity is in Btu units, so I might need to convert between units later.

Wait, actually, wait, the power generated would be 12^2 / R. So 144 / 0.0225 = 6400 W. But wait, wait, 0.0225 ohms is R, so 12 volts across 0.0225 ohms gives I = V/R = 12 / 0.0225 ≈ 533.333 A. So that's a huge current. Then power is I² R = (533.333)^2 * 0.0225 ≈ let's see: 533^2 is about 284,089. Multiply by 0.0225 → approx 284,089 *0.02 is 5,681.78, 284,089 *0.0025 is 710.2225, total approx 6,391. So that's about 6,391 watts. Wait, but earlier calculation said 6400 W. Hmm, perhaps I should double-check the calculation of R.

Wait, computing R again: R = rho * L/(A). Rho is 1.25e-4 ohm-ft. L is 2.5 ft. A is 0.0416667 ft * 0.3333333 ft = 0.0138889 ft².

So R = 1.25e-4 * 2.5 / 0.0138889.

Compute numerator: 1.25e-4 * 2.5 = 3.125e-4.

Divide by 0.0138889: 3.125e-4 / 0.0138889 = approx 0.02251 ohms.

Thus, R is approximately 0.02251 ohms. Then power P = V²/R = (12)^2 / 0.02251 = 144 / 0.02251 ≈ 6400 W.

But wait, 1 Watt is 1 Joule per second, which is about 3.41214 Btu per hour. So to convert Watts to Btu/hr: 1 W ≈ 3.41214 Btu/hr. So 6400 W = 6400 * 3.41214 ≈ 21826 Btu/hr. But I'm not sure if this is necessary at this point.

Wait, the problem is about heat conduction. The heat generated per unit volume is uniform, so the heat flux would vary across the plate.

The general heat equation for steady-state with uniform heat generation is:

k * ∇²T = -q''' 

Where q''' is the heat generation per unit volume.

But in this case, since the plate is flat and long, perhaps the temperature distribution is one-dimensional. But wait, the plate is 0.5 inches thick and 4 inches wide. So which direction is the heat conducting in? If the plate is long, maybe the heat conduction is in the cross-sectional plane, which is 2D, but if the plate is thin, perhaps it's treated as one-dimensional.

Alternatively, maybe the heat conduction occurs radially from the center to the edges, but since it's a flat plate, maybe we can model it as a 1D problem across the thickness or the width, whichever is the direction of the temperature gradient.

Wait, the problem states that the temperature of the lateral faces is 1500°F. So the edges (boundaries) are at 1500°F, and we need to find the temperature at the center.

Let me assume that the plate is treated as a 2D rectangle in the cross-section. The cross-section is 0.3333 ft (4 inches) in width and 0.04167 ft (0.5 inches) in thickness. Wait, but perhaps it's symmetric along the width or the thickness. Maybe the dominant direction is the thickness because it's much smaller.

Wait, perhaps the plate is modeled as a very thin plate, so that heat transfer is mainly across the thickness. So the thickness is 0.5 inches, which is 0.04167 ft. So let's model it as a 1D problem across the thickness. The two faces (top and bottom) are at 1500°F. Wait, no, no. Wait, the problem says the temperature of the lateral faces is 1500°F. The lateral faces are the sides along the length, so in the cross-section, the four edges: the two longer edges (0.3333 ft) and the two shorter edges (0.04167 ft). So perhaps in the cross-section, the boundary conditions are T=1500°F on all four edges. But that would mean the plate's edges are all at 1500°F, so the maximum temperature would be at the center. But wait, heat is being generated inside the plate, so the center would be hotter than the edges, which are losing heat to the surroundings.

Wait a minute, maybe the plate is losing heat through its edges, but the problem states that the heat loss from the end surfaces is neglected. Wait, the ends are the two ends along the 2.5 ft length. So the end surfaces are the two circular (or rectangular) ends of the plate. So those ends don't lose heat. The heat loss is happening from the lateral faces, which in the cross-section are the four edges. So the plate's edges (in cross-section) are at 1500°F, and the heat generated in the plate causes the center to be hotter.

Wait, but in steady-state, the heat generated inside is conducted to the edges and lost. So the temperature at the center will be higher than 1500°F.

But to find the temperature at the center, I need to model the heat conduction in the cross-section. Since the plate is long, the heat conduction is two-dimensional in the cross-section, but perhaps we can model it as a 1D problem if one dimension is much smaller than the other.

The cross-section is 0.3333 ft wide and 0.04167 ft thick. The thickness is much smaller than the width, so perhaps the heat conduction is mainly along the thickness. So treating it as a 1D problem across the thickness. So, in that case, the temperature distribution would be symmetric about the centerline of the thickness.

Wait, that makes sense. So the plate is much wider than it is thick, so the dominant direction for heat conduction is through the thickness. So the width can be considered as infinite, and the problem reduces to 1D across the thickness.

So the governing equation would be:

d²T/dy² = -q''' / k

Where y is the direction across the thickness. The heat generation per unit volume q''' is uniform.

q''' is the power generated per unit volume. The total power P is I² R, as before. Alternatively, since P = V² / R, we can compute that. But to find q''', we can compute P / volume.

Wait, yes. So q''' = P / V, where V is the volume of the plate.

The volume V = length * width * thickness. So length is 2.5 ft, width is 0.3333 ft, thickness is 0.04167 ft.

So V = 2.5 * 0.3333 * 0.04167 ≈ let's compute:

2.5 * 0.3333 ≈ 0.8333, then 0.8333 * 0.04167 ≈ 0.03472 ft³.

Then q''' = P / V. P is 6400 W. But wait, let me make sure about the units. Since P is in watts (which is J/s), and volume is in ft³, and k is in Btu/(hr·ft·°F), I might need to convert units.

Wait, let me convert P to Btu per hour. 1 Watt is 1 Joule/sec, and 1 Btu is 1055.06 J. So 1 W = 1/1055.06 Btu/sec. Then per hour, it's 3600 seconds, so 1 W = 3600 / 1055.06 ≈ 3.41214 Btu/hr. So 6400 W = 6400 * 3.41214 ≈ 21825.70 Btu/hr.

So q''' = 21825.70 Btu/hr / 0.03472 ft³ → let's compute that.

21825.70 / 0.03472 ≈ 628,300 Btu/(hr·ft³). Hmm, that's a very high value, but let's keep going.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute q''' in terms of the resistivity. Because another way to find q''' is using the resistivity and the current density.

Wait, the current density J is I / A, where I is the current and A is the cross-sectional area.

Earlier, I found I = V/R = 12 / 0.02251 ≈ 533 A.

But let's compute J = I / A. A is 0.0138889 ft². So J = 533 / 0.0138889 ≈ approximate 38,400 A/ft².

But the resistivity rho is given as 1.25e-4 ohm-ft. The power dissipated per unit volume is J² rho. So q''' = J² * rho.

So let's compute that. J is 533 A / 0.013889 ft² ≈ 38,400 A/ft². So J^2 = (38400)^2 ≈ 1.47e9 (A/ft²)^2.

Multiply by rho: 1.25e-4 ohm-ft * 1.47e9 (A²/ft^4) → 1.25e-4 * 1.47e9 = 1.8375e5 W/ft³.

Wait, that's Watts per cubic foot. But wait, 1 W = 3.41214 Btu/hr, so 1.8375e5 W/ft³ = 1.8375e5 * 3.41214 ≈ 627,200 Btu/(hr·ft³). Which matches the previous calculation.

So q''' ≈ 627,200 Btu/(hr·ft³).

Now, the 1D heat equation across the thickness is:

d²T/dy² = -q''' / k.

The solution to this equation with boundary conditions T(y=±t/2) = T_edge, where t is the thickness.

Wait, let me set up the coordinate system: y ranges from -t/2 to t/2, where t is the thickness (0.04167 ft). The center is at y=0. The edges are at y=±t/2, and T=1500°F there.

So the general solution would be:

T(y) = (-q'''/(2k)) y² + C.

Applying boundary conditions: at y = t/2, T = 1500°F.

So 1500 = (-q'''/(2k)) (t/2)^2 + C.

But wait, since the equation is symmetric around y=0, the solution will be a parabola. The maximum temperature occurs at y=0.

So integrating the equation:

The differential equation is:

d²T/dy² = -q'''/k.

Integrate once: dT/dy = (-q'''/(k)) y + C1.

The second integration: T(y) = (-q'''/(2k)) y² + C1 y + C2.

Applying symmetry condition: at y=0, dT/dy=0 (since the center is the peak), so C1=0.
