Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about group theory, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to remember what I learned about groups and their subsets. 

The question is asking under what condition a subset H of a group (G,*) is itself a group. I remember that for a subset to be a group, it must satisfy the four group axioms: closure, associativity, identity, and inverses. But since H is a subset of G, and G is already a group, some of these properties might carry over, but I think H has to satisfy them on its own.

So looking at the options, let me go through each one and see which ones are necessary for H to be a group.

Option A: a, b in H implies a / b is in H. Hmm, division isn't the standard operation; I think this is more applicable if the group operation is division. Wait, but in group theory, the operation is usually written as multiplication or addition. Maybe this isn't the right approach. Or perhaps it's referring to division as the inverse operation, like a * b⁻¹? Not sure yet.

Option B: a, b in H implies a + b in H. This is closure under addition. But the group operation here is *, so this might not be relevant unless the group is additive. I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe this is only relevant for specific types of groups, like abelian groups where the operation is addition.

Option C: a, b in H implies a - b⁻¹ in H. Again, subtraction and inverses. If the group operation is addition, then subtraction would be the inverse operation. But this seems specific, and I'm not sure if this condition is sufficient for H to be a group.

Option D: H contains the identity element. That's one of the group axioms. Every group must have an identity element. So for H to be a group, it definitely needs this. But is having the identity element enough on its own? No, because H also needs inverses and closure, etc.

Option E: a in H implies a⁻¹ is in H. This is the inverse property. So every element must have its inverse in H. That's another group axiom. So H must satisfy this. But again, on its own, this isn't enough because closure is also needed.

Option F: a, b in H implies a * b is in H. That's closure under the group operation. So this is also necessary. So H must be closed under *, and every a has an inverse in H, and H must contain the identity.

Option G: a in H implies a² is in H. Well, closure under the operation would mean that a * a is in H, so this is a specific case. But closure under * implies that all products, including a², are in H. So while this is true, it's not sufficient by itself. Because it doesn't address inverses or identity.

Option H: a in H implies a * a⁻¹ is in H. Since a⁻¹ is in H (from E), a * a⁻¹ is e, the identity. So if H contains e, then this would mean e is in H. But this option seems a bit circular because it depends on E. So H would need E and F to have closure, but I'm not sure if this option directly ensures that.

Option I: H contains the zero element. Wait, zero is the identity in an additive group. So this is similar to option D but for additive notation. So if the group operation is addition, zero is the identity. But the question uses *, which is multiplicative notation. So maybe I isn't necessary unless the group is additive. But the question doesn't specify the operation, so I'm a bit stuck.

Option J: a, b in H implies a * b⁻¹ is in H. Oh, this looks familiar. I think this is related to the definition of a subgroup. There's a theorem that says if a subset H is non-empty and for all a, b in H, a * b⁻¹ is in H, then H is a subgroup. That's because it implies closure, contains inverses, and the identity.

Wait, let me think about that. If H is non-empty, then there exists some element a in H. Then a * a⁻¹ = e is in H, so identity is present. For any a in H, a * a⁻¹ = e implies a⁻¹ is in H because if a is in H and e is in H, then a⁻¹ = a * e must be in H (if closure holds). Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. The condition a * b⁻¹ in H for all a, b in H ensures that H is closed under the operation and contains inverses. Because if you set a = b, you get e, so identity is there. For inverses, set a = e, then e * b⁻¹ = b⁻¹ must be in H. So yes, J seems to cover all the necessary conditions except perhaps associativity, but since G is already a group, associativity is inherited.

Wait, what about closure? If J holds, does H satisfy closure under *? Let's see. Suppose a and b are in H, then a * b⁻¹ is in H. But how does that imply a * b is in H? Hmm, maybe not directly. Unless you can derive it.

Alternatively, I remember that another way to state the subgroup criteria is that H is non-empty and closed under the operation and inverses. But J is a single condition, so maybe it's a shortcut.

Wait, let's think of it this way. If for any a, b in H, a * b⁻¹ is in H. Then, for any a in H, since a is in H, and a is also in H (as b), a * a⁻¹ = e is in H. So identity is covered.

Then, for any a, since e is in H, a * e = a is in H. Wait, that's just restating a is in H. But if we take a and e, then a * e⁻¹ (which is a * e, since e⁻¹ is e) is a, which is in H. Doesn't help much.

Wait, maybe I should consider inverses. Take any a in H; since a is in H and e is in H, then a * e⁻¹ = a is in H. Not helpful. Alternatively, take b = a⁻¹. Wait, but in that case, a * (a⁻¹)⁻¹ = a * a is in H. So a² is in H. But that's just closure under multiplication for some elements.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the standard subgroup tests. I recall that a non-empty subset H of G is a subgroup if for any a, b in H, a * b⁻¹ is in H. So that would be option J. This is sometimes called the "one-step subgroup test."

So, if J holds, then H is a subgroup. Because:

1. Take a = b: a * a⁻¹ = e is in H. So identity is present.

2. Take b = e (since e is in H from 1): a * e⁻¹ = a * e = a is in H. But this is just closure under identity, which is already satisfied.

Wait, no, perhaps a better approach: if a is in H, then e is in H (from a * a⁻¹). Now, for any a in H, since e is in H, a * e = a is in H (but that's trivial). Alternatively, to get the inverse, take b = a⁻¹. Wait, but if a is in H, then a⁻¹ must be in H. Because from J, if a and a are in H, then a * a⁻¹ = e is in H. But how does that get a⁻¹ into H? Because perhaps if I take a and e. Wait, a and e are in H, so a * e⁻¹ = a is in H. Not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps take a⁻¹ * a = e, but that's the same as before.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the order. Let me think again: the condition is a * b⁻¹ in H for all a, b in H.

If I want to get a⁻¹ in H, I can set a = e (since e is in H) and b = a. Then e * a⁻¹ = a⁻¹ must be in H. Because e and a are in H, so e * a⁻¹ is in H. So yes, that gives the inverse.

Then, for closure: if a and b are in H, then (a * b) * b⁻¹ = a must be in H. Wait, that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can manipulate the condition to get a * b in H.

Wait, let's see. Suppose a and b are in H. Then, since b is in H, its inverse b⁻¹ is in H (from the previous step). So a and b⁻¹ are in H, which means a * (b⁻¹)⁻¹ = a * b is in H. Because (b⁻¹)⁻¹ is b, so a * b is in H. So closure under * holds.

So yes, option J ensures that H is closed under *, contains inverses, and contains the identity. So J is a correct condition.

Wait, but what about F? Option F is closure under *. So if F holds, and E holds (inverses), and D holds (identity), then H is a group. But the question is looking for which single condition makes H a group.

The question is phrased as "H is a group if" one of the options is correct. So I need to pick the correct condition that, if met, ensures H is a group.

So the options are all individual conditions, not combinations. So which single condition is sufficient?

So for example, if option J is met, then H is a group. Because as I thought earlier, J implies closure, inverses, and identity.

In contrast, option F is closure under *, but F alone doesn't ensure inverses or identity. Similarly, option E is inverses but not closure or identity. Option D is identity but nothing else.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer is option J: a, b in H implies a * b⁻¹ is in H.

To determine under what condition a subset \( H \) of a group \( (G, *) \) is itself a group, we need to ensure that \( H \) satisfies the group axioms: closure, associativity, identity, and inverses. Since \( G \) is already a group, associativity is inherited by \( H \). Therefore, \( H \) must satisfy closure under the operation, contain the identity element, and contain inverses for all its elements.

Let us analyze the options:

- **Option A**: \( a, b \in H \Rightarrow a / b \in H \). This refers to division, which is not the standard group operation unless specified. This is not a general condition for a subset to be a group.

- **Option B**: \( a, b \in H \Rightarrow a + b \in H \). This refers to closure under addition, which is relevant only if the group operation is addition. Since the question uses multiplicative notation (\( * \)), this is not applicable.

- **Option C**: \( a, b \in H \Rightarrow a - b^{-1} \in H \). This involves subtraction and inverses, which is specific to additive groups. It is not a general condition for a subset to be a group.

- **Option D**: \( H \) contains the identity element. While this is necessary for \( H \) to be a group, it is not sufficient on its own because \( H \) must also satisfy closure and contain inverses.

- **Option E**: \( a \in H \Rightarrow a^{-1} \in H \). This ensures that \( H \) contains inverses, which is one of the group axioms. However, it is not sufficient on its own because \( H \) must also satisfy closure and contain the identity.

- **Option F**: \( a, b \in H \Rightarrow a * b \in H \). This ensures closure under the group operation, which is necessary but not sufficient on its own because \( H \) must also contain inverses and the identity.

- **Option G**: \( a \in H \Rightarrow a^2 \in H \). This is a specific case of closure under the operation. While true for groups, it is not sufficient on its own because it does not address inverses or the identity.

- **Option H**: \( a \in H \Rightarrow a * a^{-1} \in H \). Since \( a^{-1} \) is in \( H \) (from \( E \)), this implies \( a * a^{-1} = e \), the identity, is in \( H \). However, this is circular because it depends on \( E \) and does not directly ensure closure or inverses.

- **Option I**: \( H \) contains the zero element. This is relevant only for additive groups, where zero is the identity. Since the question uses multiplicative notation (\( * \)), this is not applicable.

- **Option J**: \( a, b \in H \Rightarrow a * b^{-1} \in H \). This is a well-known condition in group theory. If \( H \) is non-empty and satisfies this condition, it ensures that \( H \) is closed under the operation, contains inverses, and contains the identity. Specifically:
  - If \( a = b \), then \( a * a^{-1} = e \), so the identity is in \( H \).
  - If \( a \in H \), then \( e * a^{-1} = a^{-1} \in H \), so inverses are in \( H \).
  - If \( a, b \in H \), then \( a * b = a * (b^{-1})^{-1} \in H \), so \( H \) is closed under the operation.

Thus, **Option J** is the correct and sufficient condition for \( H \) to be a group.

**Answer: J**
