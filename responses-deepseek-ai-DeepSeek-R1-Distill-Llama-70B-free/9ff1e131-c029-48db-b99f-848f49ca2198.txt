Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. 

The problem says that Company X shipped 5 computer chips, and 1 of them was defective. Company Y shipped 4 chips, with 2 being defective. Then, one chip is chosen at random from all 9 chips, and it turns out to be defective. I need to find the probability that this defective chip came from Company Y.

Hmm, this sounds like a conditional probability question. I remember that conditional probability is when you have an event that's already happened, and you're figuring out the probability of another event given that first one. So here, the condition is that the chip is defective, and I want to know the chance it's from Y.

I think Bayes' Theorem might be useful here. Bayes' Theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. The formula is P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B). 

Let me define the events. Let Y be the event that the chip is from Company Y, and D be the event that the chip is defective. So we need to find P(Y|D), which is the probability that the chip is from Y given that it's defective.

According to Bayes' Theorem, P(Y|D) = [P(D|Y) * P(Y)] / P(D).

Alright, let's compute each part.

First, P(D|Y) is the probability that a chip is defective given that it's from Y. Company Y had 2 defective out of 4, so P(D|Y) = 2/4 = 1/2.

Next, P(Y) is the probability that a randomly selected chip is from Y. There are 4 chips from Y out of a total of 9, so P(Y) = 4/9.

Now I need P(D), which is the overall probability of selecting a defective chip. How do I find that? Well, I can think of all the defective chips. Company X had 1 defective out of 5, and Company Y had 2 out of 4. So total defective chips are 1 + 2 = 3, and total chips are 9. So P(D) = 3/9 = 1/3.

Wait, but alternatively, I can compute P(D) using the law of total probability. So P(D) = P(D|X) * P(X) + P(D|Y) * P(Y). Let me check that.

P(D|X) is the probability a chip is defective given it's from X. That's 1/5. P(X) is the probability of selecting a chip from X, which is 5/9. So (1/5)*(5/9) = 1/9. And P(D|Y) is 1/2, P(Y) is 4/9, so (1/2)*(4/9) = 2/9. Adding 1/9 + 2/9 gives 3/9, which is 1/3. Yep, that matches.

So putting it all together: P(Y|D) = [ (1/2) * (4/9) ] / (1/3) 

Let me compute the numerator first: (1/2)*(4/9) = (4/18) = 2/9.

Then divide by 1/3: (2/9) / (1/3) = (2/9) * (3/1) )= 6/9 = 2/3.

Wait wait, that can't be right. Because 2/9 divided by 1/3 is (2/9) * 3 = 6/9 = 2/3.

But let me check the calculation again. Oh wait, because 1/2 *4/9 is (4/18) which simplifies to 2/9. Divided by 1/3 is multiplying by 3, giving (2/9)*3 = 6/9 = 2/3. So P(Y|D)=2/3.

Looking at the options, option I is 2/3. So the answer should be I.

Wait, another way to think about it is: there are 3 defective chips in total. 2 are from Y. So if I pick a defective one, the chance it's Y's is 2/3. That makes sense. So that's another way without using Bayes' theorem, more intuitive. So yeah, the probability is 2/3.

To solve the problem, we use conditional probability and Bayes' Theorem. Let:

- \( Y \) be the event that the chip is from Company Y.
- \( D \) be the event that the chip is defective.

We need to find \( P(Y|D) \), the probability that the chip is from Company Y given that it is defective. According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(Y|D) = \frac{P(D|Y) \cdot P(Y)}{P(D)}
\]

1. **Compute \( P(D|Y) \):** The probability that a chip is defective given it is from Company Y is \( \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \).

2. **Compute \( P(Y) \):** The probability of selecting a chip from Company Y is \( \frac{4}{9} \).

3. **Compute \( P(D) \):** The overall probability of selecting a defective chip. There are 3 defective chips (1 from Company X and 2 from Company Y) out of 9 total chips, so \( P(D) = \frac{3}{9} = \frac{1}{3} \).

Now, substitute these values into Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(Y|D) = \frac{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{4}{9}\right)}{\frac{1}{3}}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{4}{9}\right) = \frac{4}{18} = \frac{2}{9}
\]

Then divide by \( \frac{1}{3} \):

\[
\frac{\frac{2}{9}}{\frac{1}{3}} = \frac{2}{9} \cdot 3 = \frac{6}{9} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

Thus, the probability that the defective chip came from Company Y is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

The correct answer is **I: 2/3**.
