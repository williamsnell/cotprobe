Okay, so I've got this question here about Gamma Co., and I need to figure out their profit margin on sales. Hmm, let's see what I remember from my accounting classes. I think this has to do with some financial ratios.

The question says Gamma's return on assets (ROA) is 10%, and the asset turnover is 4:1. I remember that ROA is calculated by dividing net income by total assets. And asset turnover is sales divided by total assets. Oh right, because asset turnover shows how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.

Wait, but how do these two relate to profit margin? Profit margin is net income divided by sales. So I need to connect these ratios somehow. Oh yeah, I think the formula connects ROA with profit margin and asset turnover. Let me try to remember the exact formula. Was it ROA equals profit margin multiplied by asset turnover? Or was it something else?

Wait, no, I think the correct formula is ROA = (Net Income/Sales) * (Sales/Assets). Oh, right! Because Net Income over Sales is the profit margin, and Sales over Assets is the asset turnover. So ROA is the product of profit margin and asset turnover. That makes sense because ROA tells you how much profit you're making per dollar of assets, which depends on both how much profit you make per sale and how many sales you generate per asset.

So given that, Gamma's ROA is 10%, which is 0.10 in decimal. Their asset turnover is 4, because it's 4:1, which I think is 4 in numerical terms. So plugging into the formula:

ROA = Profit Margin * Asset Turnover

0.10 = Profit Margin * 4

So to find Profit Margin, I divide 0.10 by 4. Let me do that: 0.10 /4 equals 0.025. Wait, 0.025 as a decimal, but to express that as a percentage, it's 2.5%. Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see 2.5% as an option. Let me check the options again.

Options are A:1%, B:4%, C:0.025, D:25%, E:10%, F:0.4%, G:0.1%, H:0.04%, I:40%. Wait, option C is 0.025, which is 2.5%, but none of the other options match that. Oh wait, but the question asks for the profit margin on sales. So if the calculation is 0.025, which is 2.5%, but that's not among the options. Hmm, did I do something wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. Another approach: ROA is Net Income/Assets. Asset turnover is Sales/Assets. So ROA = (Net Income/Assets) = (Net Income/Sales) * (Sales/Assets), which is Profit Margin * Asset Turnover. So yeah, that part seems correct.

So 0.10 = Profit Margin *4 → Profit Margin = 0.025 → 2.5%. But the options don't have that. Wait, looking at the options again: Option C is 0.025, which is exactly 2.5% if you represent it as a decimal. Because 0.025 as a decimal is 2.5%. Oh wait, no, the options don't specify whether they're in percentage or decimal. Let me read the options again.

The options are labeled as A: 1.00%, B:4.00%, C:0.025, etc. So Option C is 0.025, which is 2.5%, but that's not an option. Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 10% ROA and asset turnover of 4. So 10% is 0.10, divided by 4 is 0.025. So the profit margin is 0.025, which is 2.5%. Looking at the options, option C is 0.025, which would be correct. But I don't see 2.5% as an option. Alternatively, perhaps I confused the formula.

Wait, another way: Profit Margin = ROA / Asset Turnover. So 0.10 /4 = 0.025. So that's correct. So option C is the right answer. But wait, looking at the options again, option C is number C: 0.025. So that would be 2.5%, which isn't listed as an option as a percentage. Oh, but perhaps option C is correct because it's given as a decimal, not a percentage.

So the question asks for the profit margin on sales. Profit margin is usually expressed as a percentage, but in this case, the options include C as 0.025, which would equate to 2.5%. But wait, the given options don't include that as a percentage. Let me double-check the options.

Options:
A: 1.00%
B:4.00%
C:0.025
D:25.00%
E:10.00%
F:0.40%
G:0.10%
H:0.04%
I:40.00%

So option C is 0.025, which is 2.5%. So if the correct answer is 2.5%, the closest option is C. But wait, let me make sure I haven't mixed up any other ratios. Another thought: Could the formula have been Net Income = ROA * Assets, and Sales = Asset Turnover * Assets, so Sales = 4 * Assets. Then Net Income = 0.10 * Assets. So Profit Margin is Net Income / Sales = (0.10 * Assets) / (4 * Assets) ) → 0.10/4 = 0.025. So that's correct.

So the answer should be 0.025, which is option C. But wait, looking back at the options, option C is 0.025, which matches 2.5%. So the correct answer is C.

To determine Gamma Co.'s profit margin on sales, we use the relationship between Return on Assets (ROA), Asset Turnover, and Profit Margin. The formula is:

\[
ROA = \text{Profit Margin} \times \text{Asset Turnover}
\]

Given:
- \( ROA = 10\% = 0.10 \)
- \( \text{Asset Turnover} = 4:1 = 4 \)

Rearranging the formula to solve for Profit Margin:

\[
\text{Profit Margin} = \frac{ROA}{\text{Asset Turnover}} = \frac{0.10}{4} = 0.025
\]

This result, \( 0.025 \), represents the profit margin in decimal form, which is equivalent to \( 2.5\% \). Among the provided options:

- Option C corresponds to \( 0.025 \), which matches the calculated profit margin.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**C**
