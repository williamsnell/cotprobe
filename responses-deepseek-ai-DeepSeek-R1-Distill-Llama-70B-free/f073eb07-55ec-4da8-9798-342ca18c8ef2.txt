Okay, so I have this question about car insurance premiums and how accidents affect them. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about Mr. and Mrs. Tobin. They have specific coverage amounts: 50-and-100 bodily injury, $10,000 property damage, and $2,000 medical payments. They've had three accidents in the last three years and their car is kept in a 02 territory. The question is asking how much they would have saved on their premium this year if they had no accidents. The options are A through J with various dollar amounts.

Hmm, I remember that insurance companies often use rating factors to determine premiums. One of the main factors is the driver's history, specifically accidents or claims. Each accident can increase the premium because it indicates a higher risk.

I think that for each accident, there's a surcharge added to the premium. The number of surcharges depends on how many accidents or claims have been made. So, if they had no accidents, they wouldn't have these surcharges, and their premium would be lower.

But wait, I'm not exactly sure about the exact surcharge amounts. In some cases, the first accident might add a certain percentage, and each subsequent accident could add more. Or maybe each accident adds a flat rate. I'm a bit fuzzy on the details here.

I recall that some insurance companies have a "no claims discount" or something similar, where each year without an accident lowers the premium. Conversely, each accident would remove that discount and possibly add a surcharge.

So, if the Tobins had three accidents, their premium would have three surcharges. Without any accidents, they would save the amount equal to those surcharges.

But how much is each surcharge? I'm not certain. I think it's a percentage or a fixed amount per accident. Let me try to think of typical numbers. Maybe each accident adds around, say, $50 to $100 to the premium. But I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I remember something about accident surcharges being in the range of 10% to 30% of the base premium. Or maybe a flat fee. Alternatively, some companies have a step system where the first accident increases the rate by a certain amount, the second by more, and so on.

Alternatively, maybe each accident adds a fixed amount. For example, the first accident adds $100, the second $150, the third $200, so total without would be $450 saved. But looking at the options, the highest is $375 (option C). So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, I've heard that each accident could add around 20-30% to the premium. But if the base premium is, say, $1,000, three accidents might add 60%, which would be $600. But again, I'm not sure if that's accurate.

Wait, maybe the surcharge is calculated as a percentage of the premium. For example, each accident could increase the premium by a certain percentage. Let's say the base premium without any accidents is X. Each accident adds, say, 10% of X. So three accidents would add 30% of X. But I don't know the base premium here.

Alternatively, maybe the surcharge is a flat rate per accident. Let's say each accident adds $50. Then three accidents would add $150, so they'd save $150 if they had none. Looking at the options, I don't see $150, but option B is $158, which is close. Or maybe it's $50 per accident, but compounded in some way.

Wait, another approach: I think in some systems, the first accident might add a certain surcharge, and each subsequent one adds more. For example, first accident: $100, second: $150, third: $200. So total surcharge is $450. Without accidents, they'd save $450. But again, the options don't have that.

Alternatively, maybe each accident after the first increases the surcharge by a fixed amount. Like, first accident: $50, second: $75, third: $100. So total $225. Looking at the options, F is $195, which is close but not exact.

Wait, perhaps the surcharge is calculated differently. Maybe each accident adds a percentage, but the percentage increases with each accident. For example, first accident: 10%, second: 15%, third: 20%. But without knowing the base premium, it's hard to calculate.

Alternatively, maybe the Tobins are in a territory (02) where the base rates are higher. But the question is about the accident surcharge, so maybe territory is a red herring here.

Wait, perhaps I should think about how much the surcharge per accident is. I think in some cases, each accident could add around $40-$50 to the annual premium. So three accidents would add around $120 to $150. Looking at the options, B is $158, which is close. Or maybe each accident adds $52, so 3 would be $156, which rounds to $158 (option B).

Alternatively, maybe each accident adds a flat fee, like $40, so three would be $120. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the surcharge is a certain percentage of the premium. Let's see, if the total premium with three accidents is, say, P, and without, it's P minus the surcharge. But without knowing P, it's hard to calculate.

Alternatively, I remember that some insurance companies apply a surcharge based on the number of accidents. For example:

- 0 accidents: no surcharge
- 1 accident: $50 increase
- 2 accidents: $100 increase
- 3 accidents: $150 increase

So if the Tobins had three accidents, their premium would be $150 higher than if they had none. So they would save $150 by having no accidents. Looking at the options, the closest is B ($158) or maybe E ($85 is too low). But $150 isn't an option, so maybe the actual surcharge is a bit higher.

Alternatively, if each accident adds $52, then 3 would be $156, which is option B ($158). That's close.

Another approach: Maybe the surcharge is calculated as a percentage of the policy's premium. For example, each accident increases the premium by 10%. So with three accidents, the premium increases by 30%. But without knowing the base premium, it's impossible to calculate the exact savings.

Wait, but perhaps the question assumes that each accident adds a flat rate, like $50 per accident. So 3 accidents add $150. But the options don't have $150. Alternatively, maybe it's $52 per accident, which would be $156, which is close to option B ($158).

Alternatively, perhaps the surcharge is calculated as a certain amount per accident, but the exact figure is given in the options. Since the options include $158, which is option B, that might be the intended answer.

Wait, I think I've heard that each accident can increase the premium by about $50 to $100. So three accidents would be in the range of $150 to $300. Looking at the options, C is $375, which is higher, but B is $158, which is on the lower end. Alternatively, maybe each accident adds $50, so three would add $150, but the option isn't there. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the surcharge is tiered. For example:

- First accident: $50
- Second: $75
- Third: $100

Total: $225. But that's not an option either. The closest is F ($195) or G ($310).

Wait, perhaps the surcharge is based on the coverage limits. They have 50/100 bodily injury, which is $50k per person, $100k per accident. Property damage is $10k, medical payments $2k.

I think the surcharge might be a percentage of the premium. For example, each accident could add 10% to the premium. So if the base premium is, say, $1,000, three accidents would add 30%, making the premium $1,300. So the savings would be $300. But looking at the options, G is $310 and C is $375. Hmm, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, maybe the base premium without accidents is lower. For example, without any accidents, the premium is $500. With three accidents, it's $500 plus 3 surcharges. If each surcharge is $50, total is $650, so saving $150. But again, that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the surcharge is calculated per accident, but the amount increases with each accident. Like first accident adds $50, second $75, third $100, totaling $225. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, maybe each accident adds $52, so 3 would be $156, which is close to option B ($158).

Another angle: Maybe the question refers to a specific insurance company's surcharge structure. For example, some companies have a flat surcharge per accident, say, $50 each. So three would be $150. But again, the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the surcharge is $40 per accident, so 3 would be $120. But that's not an option either.

Wait, looking at the options, the highest is $375 (C) and the lowest is $72 (J). The correct answer is likely in the middle. I think I've heard that each accident can add around $50 to $100. So for three accidents, maybe around $150 to $300.

But without knowing the exact surcharge per accident, it's a bit of a guess. However, considering the options, B is $158, which is about $52 per accident. That seems plausible.

So I think the answer is B: $158.

The question involves determining how much Mr. and Mrs. Tobin would have saved on their car insurance premium if they had no accidents. They have had three accidents in the last three years, and their coverage includes 50/100 bodily injury, $10,000 property damage, and $2,000 medical payments. The key factor here is the surcharge added to the premium for each accident.

Insurance companies typically apply surcharges for accidents, which can be flat rates or percentages of the base premium. While the exact surcharge amount is not provided, it is reasonable to assume that each accident adds a flat fee, likely in the range of $50 to $100 per accident. For three accidents, this would result in a total surcharge of approximately $150 to $300.

Given the options provided, $158 (option B) aligns closely with the assumption of a flat surcharge of around $52 per accident, totaling $156 for three accidents. This makes option B the most plausible answer.

Answer: B
