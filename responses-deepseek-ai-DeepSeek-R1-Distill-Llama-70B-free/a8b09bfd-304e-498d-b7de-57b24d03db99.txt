Question:

A researcher interested in examining the potential impact of parent alcoholism on child and family development recruits 12-year-olds (n = 100), 13-year-olds (n = 100), and 14-year-olds (n = 100)—half of whom have an alcoholic parent and half of whom do not—into a multiple-year longitudinal study assessing various outcomes. This study is best characterized as:

Options:

A: A cross-sectional design
B: A correlational study
C: A pretest-posttest design
D: A cross-sequential cohort design
E: A quasi-experiment
F: A natural experiment
G: A cross-sectional cohort design
H: A true experiment
I: A case-control study
J: A longitudinal cohort design

Okay, so I need to figure out what kind of study design this researcher is using. Let me read the question carefully.

So, the researcher is looking into how parent alcoholism affects child and family development. He recruits kids aged 12, 13, and 14. Each age group has 100 participants, and half of each group have an alcoholic parent, the other half don't. It's a multiple-year longitudinal study assessing various outcomes.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my research designs, but I'll try to think through this.

First, what's a longitudinal study? I remember that longitudinal studies follow the same participants over a period of time. They can track changes and developments as the individuals age. So this fits because it's multiple years and they're assessing outcomes over time.

Wait, but the question says he's recruiting different age groups at the start. So he has 12-year-olds, 13, and 14-year-olds, each in their own group. Each of these groups is followed over time. So does that make it a specific type of longitudinal design?

I think there are different types of longitudinal designs. One is a cohort design, where you follow a single cohort over time. But here, there are multiple cohorts because he's starting with different ages.

Oh right, the cross-sequential design. Or wait, another term comes to mind: cross-sectional versus longitudinal. Cross-sectional studies take a snapshot at one point in time, maybe comparing different age groups. But this study is over multiple years, so it's longitudinal.

Wait, the setup here is that he's recruiting three different age groups, each to be followed over time. So each group is a cohort. But since they're different starting ages, it's a way to look at development across ages more efficiently. I think this is called a cross-sequential design or a cohort-sequential design.

Wait, another thought. The cross-sectional design would compare different ages at a single point in time. But since the study is longitudinal, it's tracking each group over time. So maybe it's a type of longitudinal cohort study, but with multiple cohorts.

I think the correct term is a cross-sequential cohort design. Or maybe it's called a longitudinal cohort design with multiple cohorts.

Looking at the options:

Option D: A cross-sequential cohort design.

Option J: A longitudinal cohort design.

So, what's the difference between D and J?

Longitudinal cohort design (J) would involve one cohort, like all 12-year-olds, followed each year. But in this case, the researcher has three cohorts: 12,13,14. So the design that uses multiple cohorts to study development is called cross-sequential.

Wait, another angle. In a cross-sequential design, you have people of different ages at the start, and you follow each group over time. This allows you to see changes not only over time within each group but also to compare across different ages. It's a combination of cross-sectional and longitudinal.

So the study is cross-sequential because it's longitudinal (tracking over time) and includes multiple cohorts (different starting ages). So the correct answer would be D.

Alternatively, option J is a longitudinal cohort design, which would be one cohort. Since this study has three, it's not J.

Another option is E: quasi-experiment. But I don't think that's right because the study isn't manipulating any variables; it's just observing based on whether the parent is alcoholic, which is a pre-existing condition. But quasi-experiments are about comparing groups without random assignment, so maybe it's a quasi-experiment. But the question is about the overall design, not the type of experiment.

Wait, the question is about the study design, not the experimental type. So the fact that it's following over time with multiple age groups makes it more about the longitudinal aspect.

So putting it all together, the study is a cross-sequential cohort design, which is option D.
</think>

The researcher is examining the impact of parent alcoholism on child and family development by recruiting 12-, 13-, and 14-year-olds, with half of each age group having an alcoholic parent and the other half not. The study is longitudinal, spanning multiple years, and involves assessing outcomes over time. 

Key considerations for determining the study design include:

1. **Longitudinal Study**: The study follows participants over time, which is a hallmark of longitudinal research. However, it involves multiple age groups (cohorts) at the start, distinguishing it from a single-cohort longitudinal design.

2. **Cross-Sequential Design**: This design combines cross-sectional and longitudinal elements. It involves recruiting participants of different ages (cohorts) at the start and following each cohort over time. This allows for the study of developmental changes across ages and over time.

3. **Distinction from Other Options**:
   - **Option A (Cross-sectional design)**: Incorrect, as the study is not a single-time snapshot but rather follows participants over multiple years.
   - **Option B (Correlational study)**: Incorrect, as the study is not solely focused on correlations but on tracking developmental outcomes over time.
   - **Option C (Pretest-posttest design)**: Incorrect, as this design typically involves a single group measured before and after an intervention, which is not the case here.
   - **Option E (Quasi-experiment)**: Incorrect, as the study does not involve manipulating variables or comparing groups in a quasi-experimental framework.
   - **Option J (Longitudinal cohort design)**: Incorrect, as this refers to a single cohort followed over time, whereas this study involves multiple cohorts.

Given the use of multiple age cohorts and the longitudinal follow-up, the study is best characterized as a **cross-sequential cohort design**.
