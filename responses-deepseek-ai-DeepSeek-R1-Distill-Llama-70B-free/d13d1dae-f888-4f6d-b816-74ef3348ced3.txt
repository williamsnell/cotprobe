Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Millikan's oil drop experiment. Hmm, I remember that the experiment was used to determine the elementary charge, e. The setup involves oil droplets suspended in an electric field. When the electric force balances the gravitational force, the charge on the drop can be calculated.

The question gives me the radius of the oil drop as 1.64 micrometers. Wait, micrometers are 1e-6 meters. So radius r = 1.64e-6 meters. Oh wait, no, wait—wait, the radius is in micrometers, so yeah, that's 1.64e-6 m. Got it.

Then the density is 0.851 g/cm³. Oh right, density is mass per volume. So density rho is 0.851 g/cm³. I need to convert that to kg/m³ because the standard unit for density in physics is kg/m³. So 1 g/cm³ is 1000 kg/m³. So 0.851 g/cm³ is 851 kg/m³. Okay, so rho = 851 kg/m³.

The electric field applied is downward and is 1.92e5 N/C. So E is 1.92e5 N/C. The problem asks for the charge on the drop in terms of e. So we're looking for q = ne, where n is the number of elementary charges, and e is 1.6e-19 C.

I think the key here is to find the charge when the drop is suspended, meaning the electric force equals the gravitational force. So the forces are balanced. So the electric force is qE, and the gravitational force is mg, where m is the mass of the drop and g is the acceleration due to gravity.

Wait, but wait—Millikan's experiment usually involves the drop falling when the electric field is off, so the terminal velocity is considered. Oh wait, but in this case, when the electric field is applied, the drop is suspended, so perhaps it's when the electric force equals the gravitational force. Or maybe when the net force is zero.

Wait, in some setups, they have a drop that's moving with a certain velocity when the field is off, and then the field is turned on. But the problem says it's suspended, so maybe the two forces are balancing each other. So let's model it that way.

So the equation would be qE = mg. So q = (m g)/E.

Now, m is the mass of the drop, which is volume times density. So m = (4/3)π r³ * rho.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. The mass is the volume of the sphere times the density. Yes, because density rho is mass per volume, so m = rho * V, where V is the volume of the sphere, which is (4/3)π r³.

So putting it all together, q = (rho * (4/3) π r³ * g) / E.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure about the direction of the forces. The electric field is downward, so the electric force is downward. The gravitational force is also downward. So if the drop is suspended, that would imply that the net force is zero, which would require an upward force balancing the downward forces. Hmm, but wait, that's confusing. Because if the electric field is downward, the electric force on a negative charge would be in the same direction as the field, meaning downward. So the gravitational force is also downward. So how can they balance? Wait, that doesn't make sense unless the charge is positive. Wait, but if the charge is positive, then the electric force would be downward, same as gravity, so the net force would be adding, which would make the drop accelerate down. Unless the electric force is upward, which would require a negative charge, but then the electric field direction is downward. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, in Millikan's setup, the electric field is usually applied in such a way that the electric force can counteract gravity. So if the drop is negatively charged, the electric field (downward) would exert a force downward (since E and q are in same direction if q is negative; because F = qE, so if E is down and q is negative, F is down. Wait, no: F = qE, so if q is negative, F would be opposite to E. So if E is downward, then F is upward for a negative charge. Oh, right, because F would be in the opposite direction of E when q is negative. So that makes sense.

So in this case, the electric force is upward when the charge is negative, balancing the gravitational force which is downward.

So in that scenario, the equation is qE = mg. But wait, because the electric force is upward, and the gravitational is downward, so the magnitudes must be equal for equilibrium.

So qE = mg.

Wait, but the problem says the electric field is applied and the drop is suspended. So yes, that's the condition where qE equals mg.

So let's plug in the numbers.

First, compute the volume V of the drop.

r is 1.64 micrometers, which is 1.64e-6 meters.

V = (4/3) π r³.

Calculating r³: (1.64e-6 m)^3.

Let me compute that: 1.64^3 is approximately 1.64 * 1.64 = 2.6896, then 2.6896 * 1.64 ≈ let's see, 2 * 1.64 is 3.28, 0.6896 *1.64 is about 1.13, so total around 4.41. Wait, wait, let me compute it more accurately.

1.64 * 1.64 = 2.6896.

Then 2.6896 * 1.64:

2.6896 * 1 = 2.6896

2.6896 * 0.6 = 1.61376

2.6896 * 0.04 = 0.107584

Adding: 2.6896 + 1.61376 = 4.30336 + 0.107584 = 4.410944.

So 1.64^3 ≈ 4.4109, so (1.64e-6)^3 = 4.4109e-18 m³.

So V = (4/3) * π * 4.4109e-18 m³.

Calculating (4/3)π ≈ 4.18879.

So V ≈ 4.18879 * 4.4109e-18 = Let's compute 4 *4.41 is 17.64, 0.18879*4.41 is about 0.833. So total about 18.473e-18 m³, which is 1.8473e-17 m³.

Wait, perhaps more accurately: 4.18879 *4.4109e-18 = ?

Let me compute 4 *4.4109e-18 = 1.76436e-17.

0.18879 *4.4109e-18 = approx 0.8325e-18.

So adding them: 1.76436e-17 + 0.8325e-18 = 1.8477e-17 m³.

So V ≈ 1.8477e-17 m³.

Next, calculate the mass m = rho * V.

rho is 851 kg/m³, so m = 851 kg/m³ * 1.8477e-17 m³.

Calculating that: 851 * 1.8477e-17.

Let me compute 800 *1.8477e-17 = 1.47816e-14 kg.

51 *1.8477e-17 = Let's compute 50 *1.8477e-17 = 9.2385e-16 kg. Then 1 *1.8477e-17 is 1.8477e-17 kg. So 9.2385e-16 + 1.8477e-17 is approximately 9.423e-16 kg.

So total m ≈ 1.47816e-14 + 9.423e-16 = 1.57058e-14 kg.

So m ≈ 1.5706e-14 kg.

Now, gravitational force mg. g is 9.81 m/s².

So mg = 1.5706e-14 kg * 9.81 m/s² ≈ 1.5706e-14 * 1e1 is 1.5706e-13, but more accurately:

1.5706e-14 *9.81 = let's compute 1.5706 *9.81 ≈ 15.406, so 15.406e-14 N, which is 1.5406e-13 N.

Wait, wait, 1.5706e-14 *9.81 = (1.5706 *9.81) *1e-14.

1.5706 *9.81 ≈ let me compute 1.5 *9.81 = 14.715, 0.0706*9.81≈0.693. So total about 15.408. So 15.408e-14 N, which is 1.5408e-13 N.

So mg ≈ 1.5408e-13 N.

Now, the electric force is qE = mg.

So q = mg / E.

E is 1.92e5 N/C.

So q = (1.5408e-13 N) / (1.92e5 N/C) = (1.5408 /1.92) * 1e-18 C.

Compute 1.5408 / 1.92: Let's see, 1.92 is about 2, so 1.54/1.92 = approx 0.80.

Wait, more accurately: 1.92 * 0.8 = 1.536, which is close to 1.5408. So 0.8 is about 1.536, the difference is 1.5408-1.536=0.0048, so 0.0048/1.92 = 0.0025. So 0.8 + 0.0025 = 0.8025.

So approximately 0.8025, so 0.8025 * 1e-18 C = 8.025e-19 C.

Wait, wait, but 1.5408e-13 divided by 1.92e5 is (1.5408 / 1.92 ) * (1e-13 / 1e5 )= (approx 0.8025) * 1e-18 = 8.025e-19 C.

Now, the elementary charge e is 1.602e-19 C. So q = 8.025e-19 C = (8.025 / 1.602) e.

Compute 8.025 / 1.602: approximately 5. Because 1.602*5=8.01, which is very close to 8.025. So that's about 5.005, which is roughly 5e.

Wait, but wait a second—wait, the charge I calculated is positive 8.025e-19 C, but looking at the options, all are negative multiples of e. Hmm, that's confusing. Did I make a mistake in the direction somewhere?

Wait, in the problem statement, the electric field is downward. So if the drop is suspended, the electric force must be upward to balance the gravitational force downward. So that would mean the charge is negative, because F = qE, and E is downward. So if F is upward, q must be negative.

Ah, so in my calculation, the magnitude is 5e, but the charge is negative. So q = -5e.

Looking at the options, option F is -5e.

Wait, but let me confirm my calculation once again because I might have made an arithmetic error.

Let me recheck the numbers:

r = 1.64e-6 m.

V = (4/3)π r³ = (4/3)π (1.64e-6)^3.

Compute r³: (1.64)^3 = 4.4109, so (1.64e-6)^3 = 4.4109e-18 m³.

V = 4/3 * π * 4.4109e-18 ≈ 4.18879 *4.4109e-18 ≈ 1.847e-17 m³.

m = rho * V = 851 kg/m³ *1.847e-17 m³ = 1.570e-14 kg.

mg = 1.570e-14 kg * 9.81 m/s² ≈ 1.540e-13 N.

E = 1.92e5 N/C.

q = mg/E = 1.540e-13 / 1.92e5 = (1.540 / 1.92 ) * 1e-18 = 0.802 *1e-18 = 8.02e-19 C.

e is 1.602e-19 C, so q/e = 8.02e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 5.005.

So q is approximately -5e.

So the correct answer would be F, which is -5e.

To solve the problem, we analyze the forces acting on the oil drop in Millikan's experiment. When the drop is suspended, the upward electric force balances the downward gravitational force. The electric force is given by \( F_E = qE \), and the gravitational force is \( F_g = mg \). At equilibrium, these forces are equal in magnitude:

\[
qE = mg
\]

The charge \( q \) can be expressed as \( q = ne \), where \( n \) is the number of elementary charges and \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C} \). The mass \( m \) of the oil drop is calculated using its density \( \rho \) and volume \( V \), where \( m = \rho V \). The volume of the spherical drop is:

\[
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the volume of the oil drop
The radius of the drop is \( r = 1.64 \, \mu\mathrm{m} = 1.64 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{m} \). Substituting into the formula for \( V \):

\[
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi (1.64 \times 10^{-6})^3
\]

First, calculate \( r^3 \):

\[
r^3 = (1.64)^3 \approx 4.4109 \quad \text{so} \quad (1.64 \times 10^{-6})^3 = 4.4109 \times 10^{-18} \, \mathrm{m}^3
\]

Now calculate \( V \):

\[
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi (4.4109 \times 10^{-18}) \approx 4.18879 \times 4.4109 \times 10^{-18} \approx 1.847 \times 10^{-17} \, \mathrm{m}^3
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the mass of the oil drop
The density of the oil is \( \rho = 0.851 \, \mathrm{g/cm^3} = 851 \, \mathrm{kg/m^3} \). Using \( m = \rho V \):

\[
m = 851 \times 1.847 \times 10^{-17} \approx 1.571 \times 10^{-14} \, \mathrm{kg}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the gravitational force
The gravitational force is:

\[
F_g = mg = (1.571 \times 10^{-14}) \times 9.81 \approx 1.540 \times 10^{-13} \, \mathrm{N}
\]

### Step 4: Relate the electric force to the charge
The electric force is:

\[
F_E = qE = 1.540 \times 10^{-13} \, \mathrm{N}
\]

The electric field is \( E = 1.92 \times 10^5 \, \mathrm{N/C} \). Solving for \( q \):

\[
q = \frac{F_E}{E} = \frac{1.540 \times 10^{-13}}{1.92 \times 10^5} \approx 8.02 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C}
\]

### Step 5: Express the charge in terms of \( e \)
The elementary charge is \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C} \). Thus:

\[
n = \frac{q}{e} = \frac{8.02 \times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 5
\]

Since the oil drop is negatively charged (as inferred from the direction of the electric field and the suspended state), the charge is:

\[
q = -5e
\]

### Final Answer:
The charge on the oil drop is **-5e**, corresponding to option **F**.
