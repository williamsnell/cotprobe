Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about support vectors in SVMs, and I'm a bit new to the topic. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, I remember that SVM stands for Support Vector Machine. It's a machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression. The main idea is to find a hyperplane that separates the data into different classes. But wait, what exactly are support vectors in this context?

From what I've read before, support vectors are specific data points that the SVM uses to define the boundary between classes. They are the points that are closest to the separating hyperplane. Oh right, these points are crucial because they determine the position and orientation of the hyperplane. So if you move a support vector, it would change the hyperplane, but moving other points that are far away wouldn't affect it as much.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The data outliers in an SVM. Hmm, I don't think so. Outliers are data points that are distant from other data points, but support vectors are the ones closest to the hyperplane, not necessarily outliers. So A might not be correct.

Option B: The data points used to calculate the distance in an SVM. Wait, maybe. The support vectors are on the edge of the margin, so they are the ones that the distance (like the margin) is calculated from. So this could be a possibility.

Option C: The only examples necessary to compute f(x) in an SVM. Oh right, because once the model is trained, you can throw away the other data points except the support vectors. The decision function f(x) is based on the support vectors, so C sounds correct.

Option D: The data centroid. No, the centroid is the center of the data points, which isn't directly related to support vectors. So D is probably wrong.

Option E: All examples that have a zero weight αk in an SVM. Wait, in SVMs, the weights α are Lagrange multipliers. I remember that for most points, α is zero, and those are the points that don't lie on the margin. The support vectors have non-zero α. So E is the opposite of correct, because E says zero α, which would be non-support vectors. So E is incorrect.

Option F: The examples farthest from the decision boundary. No, that's the opposite. Support vectors are the closest to the boundary. So F is wrong.

Option G: All examples that fall within the decision boundary in an SVM. The decision boundary is the hyperplane itself, but support vectors lie on the margin, not within. So G doesn't seem right.

Wait, putting it all together. Support vectors are the data points that lie exactly on the margin (the edge) of the separating hyperplane. They are the ones that the SVM uses to construct the decision boundary. So the key points are:

- They are the closest to the hyperplane.
- They define the margin.
- Only these points are needed to compute the decision function f(x) because other points don't affect it.

So looking back at the options:

Option C says they're the only examples needed to compute f(x), which aligns with what I remember. So C must be correct.

Option B says they're used to calculate the distance. That also makes sense because the margin is calculated based on these points. But wait, the question is about what support vectors are, not just their use. So B might describe a property, but is it the definition? Or is the definition that support vectors are the points that define the boundary and are thus the only ones needed for prediction.

So the question is asking "what are support vectors?" and the options are definitions.

So support vectors are the points that lie on the margin and are the only ones needed to compute the function. So C is correct.

Another angle: when you train an SVM, the algorithm finds these support vectors, and once trained, you can discard all other training data. So for making predictions, you only need the support vectors. So yes, C is correct.

Support vectors in a Support Vector Machine (SVM) are the specific data points that lie closest to the separating hyperplane and are crucial for defining the boundary between classes. These points determine the position and orientation of the hyperplane, and moving them would alter the hyperplane, unlike other data points that are farther away. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. Support vectors are not outliers; they are the points closest to the hyperplane.
- **B**: Partially correct but not the full definition. While support vectors are used to calculate the margin, this does not fully define what they are.
- **C**: Correct. Support vectors are the only examples necessary to compute the decision function \( f(x) \), as other data points do not influence the prediction once the model is trained.
- **D**: Incorrect. The centroid is unrelated to support vectors.
- **E**: Incorrect. Support vectors have non-zero weights (\( \alpha_k \)), not zero.
- **F**: Incorrect. Support vectors are the closest to the decision boundary, not the farthest.
- **G**: Incorrect. Support vectors lie on the margin, not within the decision boundary.

Thus, the best definition of support vectors is that they are the only examples necessary to compute \( f(x) \) in an SVM.
