Okay, so I've got this problem about diffusion rates of oxygen under different conditions. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I remember from my studies that diffusion rate calculations often involve Fick's Law, but I'm a bit rusty on the exact details. 

The problem has two parts, (I) and (II). Let's start with part (I). 

In part (I), oxygen (A) is diffusing through nitrogen (B), which is non-diffusing. The setup is at steady state. The given data includes the temperature (0°C), total pressure (1e5 N/m²), partial pressures of O2 at two points 2.2 mm apart, and the diffusivity D is 1.81e-5 m²/s.

I think Fick's Law for steady-state diffusion in a binary mixture is the way to go here. Fick's Law is usually written as N = -D * (dC/dx), where N is the diffusion rate, D is diffusivity, and dC/dx is the concentration gradient. But wait, concentration can be expressed in terms of partial pressure when the gas behaves ideally.

So the concentration C can be found using the ideal gas law, C = P/(R*T). Since pressure and temperature are given, I can calculate this.

Wait, but for part (I), since nitrogen is non-diffusing, the formula should just be the simple Fick's Law. Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the concentration gradient (dC/dx) using the partial pressures.
2. Use D to find the flux N.

First, the partial pressures are 13500 N/m² and 6000 N/m² at two points 2.2 mm apart. So the distance x is 2.2 mm, which I'll convert to meters: 0.0022 m.

The concentration C for each point can be P/(R*T). But since R and T are constants, the difference in concentration will be (P1 - P2)/(R*T), and when divided by x, it's (P1-P2)/(R*T*x).

Wait, but Fick's Law for molar flux (N) would be N = -D * (C2 - C1)/x. Or since C1 > C2, the flux will be positive in the direction from high to low concentration.

Alternatively, using partial pressures, I think the equation might be written as N = (D * (P1 - P2)) / (R*T*x). Because C = P/(R*T), so (C1 - C2) = (P1 - P2)/(R*T), and then multiplied by D and divided by x.

Let me confirm the formula. Oh right, the molar flux for diffusion is given by N_A = (-D_AB * (P_A1 - P_A2)) / (R*T*x). Wait, no, maybe it's N_A = (D_AB/(R*T)) * (P_A1 - P_A2)/x. Or perhaps I should think in terms of concentrations.

Wait, let's compute step by step.

Compute dC/dx first.

C1 = P1/(R*T)
C2 = P2/(R*T)
So dC = C1 - C2 = (P1 - P2)/(R*T)
Then, dC/dx = (P1 - P2)/(R*T * x)

So Fick's Law: N = D * (dC/dx) = D*(P1-P2)/(R*T*x)

Wait, no, wait. Fick's Law is N = -D * (dC/dx). But since we're taking the direction from high to low, it'll be positive. So the formula should be N = D*(C1 - C2)/x. Substituting C1 and C2, that's N = D*(P1 - P2)/(R*T*x).

Alternatively, I've seen another form: N = (D * (P1 - P2)) / (x * R * T)

So that's the formula I'll use.

Now, plugging in the numbers:

D = 1.81e-5 m²/s
P1 = 13500 N/m²
P2 = 6000 N/m²
x = 0.0022 m
R is the gas constant. Wait, which value of R do I use? Since the units are in N/m², kmol, etc., I think R is 8314 J/kmol·K, because when using pressure in Pascals (N/m²), R is 8314. 

Wait, no. Let me think. The ideal gas law is PV = nRT, so R is 8314 J/(kmol·K) when pressure is in kPa. Wait, but here, the pressure is given in N/m², which is Pascals (Pa). So 1 Pa = 1 N/m². So R would be 8314 J/(kmol·K), which is equivalent to (8314 Pa·m³)/(kmol·K), since 1 J = 1 Pa·m³.

Wait, but I'm getting confused here. Let me double-check. 

Yes, R is 8314 Pa·m³/(kmol·K). Because 1 J = 1 Pa·m³, so R is 8314 (Pa m³)/(kmol K).

So, R = 8314 Pa m³/(kmol K)
T is 0°C = 273.15 K.

So, putting it all together:

N = (D * (P1 - P2)) / (x * R * T)

Plugging in the numbers:

D = 1.81e-5 m²/s
P1 - P2 = 13500 - 6000 = 7500 Pa
x = 0.0022 m
R = 8314 Pa m³/(kmol K)
T = 273.15 K

So:

Numerator: 1.81e-5 * 7500 = Let me compute that. 1.81e-5 * 7500 = 1.81 * 7.5e2 * 1e-5 = 1.81 * 0.075 = 0.13575? Wait, wait: 7500 is 7.5e3. So 1.81e-5 * 7.5e3 = (1.81 * 7.5) * 1e-2.

1.81 * 7.5 = 13.575. So 13.575e-2 = 0.13575 m²/s·Pa.

Denominator: 0.0022 m * 8314 Pa m³/(kmol K) * 273.15 K.

Let me compute the denominator:

0.0022 * 8314 * 273.15

First, compute 8314 * 273.15. Let me approximate.

8314 * 273 ≈ 8314 * 2.73e2 = ?

Well, 8000 * 273 = 2,184,000
314 * 273 ≈ 85, 800 + ... let's compute 300*273=81,900 and 14*273=3,822. So 81,900 + 3,822 = 85,722. So total is 2,184,000 + 85,722 ≈ 2,269,722.

Then multiply by 0.0022:

2,269,722 * 0.0022 ≈ 2,269,722 * 2.2e-3 = 

Well, 2e6 * 2.2e-3 = 4,400.
269,722 * 2.2e-3 ≈ 269,722 * 0.0022 ≈ 593.  So total denominator is about 4,400 + 593 ≈ 4,993. So approx 4,993 Pa m³/(kmol).

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

8314 * 273.15: Let's compute.

273.15 = 273 + 0.15

8314 * 273 = let's compute:

8000 * 273 = 2,184,000

314 * 273 = let's compute:

300 * 273 = 81,900

14 * 273 = 3,822 → total 85,722.

So 2,184,000 + 85,722 = 2,269,722.

Then 8314 * 0.15 = 1,247.1.

So 2,269,722 + 1,247.1 = 2,270,969.1.

Then, 0.0022 * 2,270,969.1 = ?

0.002 * 2,270,969.1 = 4,541.9382

0.0002 * 2,270,969.1 = 454.19382

So total is 4,541.9382 + 454.19382 ≈ 4,996.132 m³·Pa/(kmol).

So denominator is approximately 4,996.132.

Now, N = numerator / denominator = 0.13575 / 4,996.132 ≈ ?

Let me compute 0.13575 ÷ 4996.132.

Hmm, 0.13575 / 5000 ≈ 2.715e-5. But since 4996 is slightly less than 5000, the result will be a bit higher.

But let me compute it more accurately.

4996.132 = approx 5e3 - 3.868.

So 0.13575 / 4996.132 ≈ (0.13575 / 5000) * (1 / (1 - (3.868/5000))) )

Using approximation, but perhaps it's easier to compute directly.

0.13575 ÷ 4996.132 ≈ 2.716e-5.

Wait, 4996 * 2.716e-5 = ?

Wait, 5000 * 2.716e-5 = 0.1358.

So 4996 * 2.716e-5 ≈ 0.1358 * (4996/5000) = 0.1358 * 0.9992 ≈ 0.1356.

Which is close to the numerator 0.13575, so the value is approximately 2.716e-5 kmol/(m²·s).

Wait, but wait: let's make sure about the units.

Yes, the units should be kmol/(m²·s), since the flux N is in kmol/(m²·s).

So the calculation for part (I) gives approximately 2.71e-5 kmol/(m²·s). Looking at the options, let's see:

Options are in the range of 2.4e-5 to 2.9e-5.

Looking at the choices, option F is 2.70e-5 and 2.71e-5, which matches our calculation for part (I). But wait, part (I) is the first part of the problem, so the options are pairs where the first is part (I) and the second part (II).

Wait, let me look at the options again:

Option F: 2.70e-5, 2.71e-5

Option H: 2.75e-5, 2.76e-5

Option B: 2.75, 2.80.

Wait, but my calculation for part (I) is about 2.716e-5, which is approximately 2.72e-5, but option F's first value is 2.70e-5 and second 2.71e-5. Hmm, maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the denominator more accurately.

Denominator: x * R * T = 0.0022 m * 8314 (Pa·m³/(kmol·K)) * 273.15 K.

Compute 8314 * 273.15 first:

8314 * 273.15 = ?

Let me compute 8314 * 273 = ?

Well, 8000 *273=2,184,000.

314 *273: 300*273=81,900; 14*273=3,822. So 81,900+3,822=85,722.

So 2,184,000 +85,722=2,269,722.

Now 8314 * 0.15 = 1,247.1.

So total is 2,269,722 + 1,247.1 = 2,270,969.1.

Now, x is 0.0022 m, so 0.0022 * 2,270,969.1 = ?

0.0022 * 2,270,969.1 = 0.002 * 2,270,969.1 = 4,541.9382, plus 0.0002 *2,270,969.1 = 454.19382.

Total is 4,541.9382 + 454.19382 = 4,996.132 kmol^-1 m^3 Pa s.

Wait, no, the units: Pa·m³/(kmol·K) * K * m → Pa·m^4/(kmol).

So denominator is 4,996.132 Pa·m^4/(kmol).

Numerator is 1.81e-5 m²/s * 7500 Pa = 135,750 Pa·m²/s.

Wait wait, no:

N = (D*(P1-P2)) / (x*R*T) → units:

D is m²/s, (P1-P2) is Pa, x is m, R is Pa·m³/(kmol·K), T is K.

So numerator: m²/s * Pa.

Denominator: m * (Pa·m³/(kmol·K)) * K → m * Pa·m³/(kmol).

So overall units: (m²/s * Pa) / (Pa·m^4/(kmol)) ) = (m²/s) * Pa * kmol/(Pa·m^4) ) → (kmol/(s·m²)).

Which is correct for N (kmol/(m²·s)).

So the calculation:

Numerator: 1.81e-5 m²/s * 7500 Pa = 1.81e-5 * 7500 = 135.75 Pa·m²/s.

Denominator: 4,996.132 Pa·m^4/kmol.

So N = 135.75 / 4996.132 ≈ 0.02716 kmol/(m²·s).

Wait, no, because 135.75 / 4996.132 is 0.02716? Wait, no, 135.75 divided by 4996 is about 0.02716? No, wait, 4996 is about 5e3, so 135 / 5e3 is 0.027. But 135.75 / 4996 ≈ 0.02716?

Wait, let me compute 135.75 ÷ 4996.132.

4996.132 ÷ 1000 = ~4.996.

So 135.75 ÷ 4.996 ≈ 27.19.

Wait, that can't be right. I think I'm messing up the decimal points.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me correct:

N = (D*(P1-P2)) / (x R T) → D=1.81e-5, P1-P2=7500.

So 1.81e-5 * 7500 = 0.13575 (units: m²/s * Pa).

Denominator: x R T = 0.0022 * 8314 *273.15 ≈ 0.0022 * 2,270,969 ≈ 4,996.

So 0.13575 / 4996 ≈ 2.716e-5 kmol/(m²·s).

Wait, because 0.13575 / 4996 is about 2.716e-5.

Yes, because 4996 * 2.7e-5 ≈ 0.135.

So part (I) gives approximately 2.716e-5 kmol/(m²·s).

Looking at the options, the first part of option F is 2.70e-5, and the second is 2.71e-5. So option F is a possible candidate.

But wait, I have to compute part (II) as well. Let's proceed.

Part (II) is when the non-diffusing gas is a mixture of nitrogen (B) and carbon dioxide (C) in a volume ratio of 2:1. So the mixture is 2 parts N2 and 1 part CO2 by volume. So their mole fractions are y_B = 2/3, y_C = 1/3.

In this case, the diffusion coefficient for O2 would be the harmonic mean of the diffusion coefficients of O2 in N2 and O2 in CO2.

Wait, what's the correct approach when dealing with a mixture of gases as the non-diffusing component? I think the effective diffusion coefficient D_eff is calculated using the formula:

1/D_eff = (y_B / D_AB) + (y_C / D_AC)

Where D_AB is the diffusion coefficient of O2 in N2, and D_AC is that in CO2.

So in this case, D_AB = 1.81e-5 m²/s, D_AC = 1.85e-5 m²/s.

Mole fractions: y_B = 2/3, y_C = 1/3.

So,

1/D_eff = ( (2/3) / 1.81e-5 ) + ( (1/3) / 1.85e-5 )

Compute each term:

Term1 = (2/3) / 1.81e-5 ≈ (0.6667) / 1.81e-5 ≈ approx 3.68e4.

Wait, 1.81e-5 is 0.0000181. So 0.6667 / 0.0000181 ≈ 36842.

Similarly, term2 = (1/3) / 1.85e-5 ≈ 0.3333 / 0.0000185 ≈ 18,027.

So 1/D_eff = 36842 + 18027 = 54869.

Thus, D_eff = 1 / 54869 ≈ 1.823e-5 m²/s.

Wait, let's compute it more accurately.

Compute term1:

(2/3) / 1.81e-5 = (2/3) * (1 / 1.81e-5) 

Wait, 1 / 1.81e-5 = approx 55249
