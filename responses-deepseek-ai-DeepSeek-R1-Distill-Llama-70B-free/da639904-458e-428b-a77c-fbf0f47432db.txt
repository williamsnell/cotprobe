Okay, so I've got this physics problem here with two parts. I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with gravitational calculations, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

So, the first part is about two lead balls. Their masses are 5.20 kg and 0.250 kg. Their centers are 50.0 cm apart. I need to find the force with which they attract each other. Oh right, this is a Newton's law of gravitation problem. Newton's formula is F = G*(m1*m2)/(r²), where G is the gravitational constant.

Wait, what's the value of G? I remember it's 6.67 times 10^-11 N·m²/kg². Yeah, that sounds right. So I'll plug in the numbers.

First, I need to convert everything into meters because the units in G are in meters. So 50 cm is 0.5 meters. Then, m1 is 5.20 kg, m2 is 0.250 kg. Let's compute the numerator first: 5.20 * 0.250 = 1.3 kg². Wait, no, wait. 5.2 * 0.25 is 1.3, but since both are in kg, the product is kg squared.

Then, the denominator is r squared. r is 0.5 m, so 0.5 squared is 0.25 m². So putting it all together: F = (6.67e-11) * (1.3) / (0.25).

Wait, let me compute that. 1.3 divided by 0.25 is 5.2. Then 6.67e-11 times 5.2. 5.2 *6.67 is about 34.7, so 34.7e-11, which is 3.47e-10 Newtons. Hmm, looking at the options, some have 3.46e-10, which is close considering rounding. So for part (1), the force is approximately 3.46e-10 N.

Now, the second part: computing the mass of the Earth. The problem states that g at the surface is 9.806 m/s², and the Earth's radius is 6.371e6 meters. I think I can use the formula for gravitational acceleration at the Earth's surface, which is g = G*M/(R²), where M is the Earth's mass, R is radius.

So I need to solve for M. Rearranging the formula, M = (g * R²) / G.

Plugging in the numbers: g is 9.806, R is 6.371e6 m, G is 6.67e-11.

Calculating R squared first: (6.371e6)^2. Let me compute that. 6.371e6 squared is approximately (6.371)^2 = about 40.58, and then (1e6)^2 is 1e12. So 40.58e12 m².

So R² is 4.058e13 m²? Wait, wait, 6.371e6 squared is (6.371)^2 * (1e6)^2 = 40.58 * 1e12 = 4.058e13 m².

So M = (9.806 * 4.058e13) / (6.67e-11)

Let me compute numerator first: 9.806 * 4.058e13. Let's approximate 10 * 4.058e13 is 4.058e14, but since it's 9.806, which is about 0.981 of 10, so 4.058e14 * 0.981 ≈ 3.98e14.

Wait, wait, let me do it more accurately. 9.806 * 4.058e13:

9 * 4.058e13 = 3.6522e14, 0.806 *4.058e13 is approximately 3.272e13. So total is 3.6522e14 + 0.3272e14 = 3.9794e14 kg·m²/s²? Not sure about the units, but let's proceed.

Then, divide by G which is 6.67e-11.

So M = 3.9794e14 / 6.67e-11 = (3.9794 /6.67 )e25.

3.9794 divided by 6.67 is about 0.597, so M ≈ 0.597e25 kg, which is 5.97e24 kg.

Looking at the options, option A has 5.967e24 kg. Oh wait, option D has 5.972e24. Hmmm. My approximate calculation got 5.97e24, which matches option A's 5.967e24, which is very close. Alternatively, perhaps a more precise calculation would get closer.

Wait, maybe I should do the calculation more accurately.

Let me redo M.

M = (g R²) / G.

g =9.806, R =6.371e6 m.

R² = (6.371e6)^2 = (6.371)^2 * 1e12.

6.371 squared: 6 *6=36, 0.371^2≈0.137, and cross terms: 2*6*0.371=4.452. So 6.371^2 is approximately 40.58, yes. So R²=40.58e12 =4.058e13 m².

g*R² =9.806 *4.058e13 = let's compute 9.806 *4.058e13.

9 *4.058e13 = 3.6522e14.

0.806 *4.058e13: 0.8 *4.058e13 =3.2464e13, 0.006 *4.058e13=2.4348e11. Sum: 3.2464e13 + 0.24348e13 = 3.48988e13. So total gR²=3.6522e14 +3.48988e13 = approx 3.6522e14 + 0.348988e14 = 4.00118e14.

Wait, no, wait 3.6522e14 is 36.522e13, 3.48988e13 is 3.48988e13. So adding gives 36.522e13 +3.48988e13 =39.01188e13 =3.901188e14.

Now, M = 3.901188e14 /6.67e-11.

Divide 3.901188e14 by 6.67e-11. Let's write this as (3.901188 /6.67 )e25.

3.901188 /6.67 ≈ 0.585. Because 6.67 *0.585 = approx 3.9 (6.67 *0.5 is 3.335; 6.67*0.08=0.5336; 6.67*.005=0.03335. Sum 3.335+0.5336=3.8686 +0.03335=3.90195). Wow, that's a close match. So 0.585 *1e25 kg is 5.85e24 kg, but wait, let me recheck.

Wait 3.901e14 /6.67e-11 = (3.901e14)/(6.67e-11) )= (3.901 /6.67 )e(14+11) ) = (0.585) * 1e25 =5.85e24 kg.

Wait, but earlier I thought I had 5.97e24. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Wait, let me recheck the numbers.

Wait, 6.371e6 squared is 40.5841e12, right? Because (6.371)^2 is 40.5841, so 40.5841e12 m².

g is 9.806, so 9.806 *40.5841e12 = 9.806 *4.05841e13.

Wait, 9.806 *4.05841e13 = let's compute 9 *4.05841e13 = 3.6527e14, and 0.806 *4.05841e13.

0.8 *4.05841e13 =3.2467e13, and 0.006 *4.05841e13=2.43505e11. So 3.2467e13 + 2.43505e11 = 3.4902e13.

So total is 3.6527e14 +3.4902e13 = 3.6527e14 + 0.34902e14 = 4.00172e14.

Now, M =4.00172e14 / 6.67e-11.

Compute 4.00172e14 /6.67e-11 = 4.00172 /6.67 = approx 0.6003, so 0.6003e25 =6.003e24 kg.

Wait, wait, that's different from before. Wait, wait, 4.00172e14 divided by 6.67e-11 is (4.00172 /6.67) * 1e25.

4.00172 /6.67 = let me compute that. 6.67 *0.6 =4.002. Oh wait, 6.67 *0.6 is 4.002. So 4.00172 is just a bit less than 4.002.

So 4.00172 /6.67 = 0.6. Almost exactly 0.6. So M is 0.6e25 kg, which is 6.0e24 kg. But wait, the options don't have exactly 6.0e24. Option A's second part is 5.967e24, and option J has 6.674e24. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately. Let me compute 4.00172 /6.67.

Compute 6.67 * 0.6 =4.002. But our numerator is 4.00172, which is 4.00172. So the difference between 4.00172 and 4.002 is 0.00028. So that's a difference of 0.00028 in the numerator, which is 6.67 * x =0.00028. So x=0.00028/6.67≈0.000042.

So 0.6 - 0.000042 ≈ 0.599958. So approximately 0.59996e25 =5.9996e24 kg, which is about 6.00e24 kg. But the options don't have 6.00e24, but option A is 5.967e24, which is a bit lower.

Hmm. But wait, in my earlier calculation, I thought the numerator was 3.901e14, which when divided by 6.67e-11 gives 5.85e24. But that's conflicting with the later approach where I got 6.0e24. What am I doing wrong here?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating R squared. Let me double-check:

R is 6.371e6 meters. So R squared is (6.371e6)^2. Let me compute 6.371^2 = 40.5841, so R squared is 40.5841e12 m², which is 4.05841e13 m². Correct.

g is 9.806 m/s². So g * R squared is 9.806 *4.05841e13.

Let me compute 9.806 *4.05841e13:

Compute 10 *4.05841e13 =4.05841e14.

But since it's 9.806, which is 10 - 0.194.

So 9.806 *4.05841e13 = 4.05841e14 - (0.194 *4.05841e13).

Compute 0.194 *4.05841e13:

0.194 *4.05841e13 = 0.194 *4.05841 *1e13.

0.194 *4.05841 ≈ 0.7875 (since 0.2 *4.05841≈0.8117, but 0.194 is 0.006 less than 0.2, so 0.2 *4.05841=0.8117, minus 0.006 *4.05841≈0.02435, so 0.8117 - 0.02435=0.78735).

So 0.194 *4.05841e13≈0.78735e13.

Subtracting from 4.05841e14: 4.05841e14 - 0.78735e13 = 3.9795e14.

So M = 3.9795e14 /6.67e-11.

Compute 3.9795e14 /6.67e-11.

3.9795e14 /6.67e-11 = (3.9795 /6.67) *1e25.

3.9795 /6.67 ≈ let's see. 6.67 *0.597= approx 3.979. Because 6.67*0.5=3.335, 6.67*0.09=0.6003, 6.67*0.007=0.04669. So 3.335 +0.6003=3.9353 +0.04669=3.98199. That's very close to 3.9795.

So 6.67 *0.597 ≈3.98199, which is just a bit higher than 3.9795. So 0.597 - (3.98199 -3.9795)/(6.67 per 0.001). The difference is 3.98199 -3.9795=0.00249.

So 0.00249 /6.67 ≈0.000373. So 0.597 -0.000373≈0.5966.

So M≈0.5966e25 kg=5.966e24 kg.

Looking back at the options, option A is 5.967e24 kg, which is very close. So that's the mass of the Earth.

So for part (1), the force is approximately 3.46e-10 N, and for part (2), the Earth's mass is approximately 5.967e24 kg. Looking at the options, option A has the first part 3.46e-10 N and the second part 5.967e24 kg. So the correct answer should be option A.

To solve the given problem, we address each part systematically:

---

### Part (1): Force Between Two Lead Balls

We use Newton's law of gravitation:

\[
F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}
\]

Where:
- \( G = 6.67 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{kg}^2 \) (gravitational constant),
- \( m_1 = 5.20 \, \text{kg} \),
- \( m_2 = 0.250 \, \text{kg} \),
- \( r = 50.0 \, \text{cm} = 0.5 \, \text{m} \).

1. Compute the numerator:  
   \[
   m_1 m_2 = 5.20 \times 0.250 = 1.3 \, \text{kg}^2
   \]

2. Compute the denominator:  
   \[
   r^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25 \, \text{m}^2
   \]

3. Compute the force:  
   \[
   F = \frac{(6.67 \times 10^{-11}) \times 1.3}{0.25} = (6.67 \times 10^{-11}) \times 5.2 = 3.47 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{N}
   \]

Thus, the force between the two lead balls is approximately \( 3.46 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{N} \), matching the first part of option A.

---

### Part (2): Mass of the Earth

We use the formula for gravitational acceleration at the Earth's surface:

\[
g = \frac{G M}{R^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( M \):

\[
M = \frac{g R^2}{G}
\]

Where:
- \( g = 9.806 \, \text{m/s}^2 \),
- \( R = 6.371 \times 10^6 \, \text{m} \),
- \( G = 6.67 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{kg}^2 \).

1. Compute \( R^2 \):  
   \[
   R^2 = (6.371 \times 10^6)^2 = 40.5841 \times 10^{12} = 4.05841 \times 10^{13} \, \text{m}^2
   \]

2. Compute \( g R^2 \):  
   \[
   g R^2 = 9.806 \times 4.05841 \times 10^{13} = 3.9795 \times 10^{14} \, \text{m}^3/\text{s}^2
   \]

3. Compute \( M \):  
   \[
   M = \frac{3.9795 \times 10^{14}}{6.67 \times 10^{-11}} = \frac{3.9795}{6.67} \times 10^{25} \approx 0.597 \times 10^{25} = 5.97 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg}
   \]

This matches the second part of option A, \( 5.967 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg} \).

---

### Final Answer

Both parts of the problem are consistent with option **A**.  
**Answer: A**
