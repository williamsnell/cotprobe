Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about the combustion of sucrose and how the Gibbs energy changes when the temperature increases from 298 K (which is about 25°C) to 37°C, which is blood temperature. They want the additional non-expansion work that can be obtained. Hmm, okay, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think this through.

So, the given data are at 298 K. The standard enthalpy of combustion of sucrose is -5797 kJ/mol. That's a pretty big negative number, which makes sense because combustion is exothermic. The standard Gibbs energy of the reaction is -6333 kJ/mol. Wait, that's even more negative. That's interesting because I remember that ΔG is related to the maximum non-expansion work. 

Wait, I thought that at standard conditions, ΔG° is the maximum useful work (excluding expansion work, I guess). So for a reaction, when ΔG is negative, the process is spontaneous, and it can do work. So, at 298 K, the Gibbs energy is already negative, which implies that the reaction can perform some work.

Now, the question is about raising the temperature to 37°C. So the new temperature is 310 K (since 37°C is 310.15 K, roughly 310 K). They want the additional non-expansion work, so the change in Gibbs energy between these two temperatures, I suppose. Because the additional work would be the difference in ΔG at 310 K and 298 K.

Wait, but wait. The problem says "additional non-expansion work that may be obtained by raising the temperature." So I think we need to find the change in ΔG when T increases from 298 K to 310 K. So the additional work would be ΔG(310) minus ΔG(298), and since work is obtained, it's the change that allows more work to be done. But I'm not entirely sure if it's the difference or something else.

I remember the formula for Gibbs free energy: ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. So, if the temperature changes, ΔG will change. But wait, this equation is for a particular temperature. So to find ΔG at a different temperature, we might need to consider how ΔH and ΔS change with temperature, but assuming they are constant (as in, using the standard values), perhaps we can approximate.

Alternatively, maybe the question is using the standard Gibbs energy at 298 K and wants us to find the Gibbs energy at 310 K, using the same ΔH and assuming ΔS is constant. Wait, but I think in reality both ΔH and ΔS can vary with temperature, but if they're given as standard values at 298 K, perhaps we can use those to approximate.

Wait, but the Gibbs energy at 310 K would be ΔG2 = ΔH - T2ΔS. But wait, I don't have ΔS, though. Hmm, but I can calculate ΔS from the data given at 298 K.

Because at 298 K, ΔG1 = ΔH - T1ΔS. So rearranging that, ΔS = (ΔH - ΔG1) / T1.

Let me plug in the numbers. ΔH is given as -5797 kJ/mol, and ΔG1 is -6333 kJ/mol. So (ΔH - ΔG1) would be (-5797) - (-6333) = 536 kJ/mol.

Wait, let me check that again. ΔH is -5797, and ΔG1 is -6333. So ΔH - ΔG1 is (-5797) - (-6333) = (6333 -5797) = 536 kJ/mol. Yes.

So ΔS = 536 kJ/mol / 298 K. Wait, 536 divided by 298. Let me compute that. 298 is approximately 300, so 536/300 is roughly 1.787. So about 1.79 kJ/mol·K. But wait, let's calculate it exactly.

536 ÷ 298 ≈ let's see, 298 times 1.8 is 536.4 (since 300*1.8=540; 298 is 2 less, so 298*1.8=536.4). So 536/298≈1.797 ≈1.797 kJ/mol·K. So approximately 1.797 kJ/(mol·K).

Wait, but wait, the units here. Because ΔH and ΔG are in kJ/mol, so when we divide by T in K, we get kJ/(mol·K). So that's correct.

Now, to find ΔG at 310 K, we can use the same equation: ΔG2 = ΔH - T2ΔS.

So plug in the numbers:

ΔH is -5797 kJ/mol.

T2 is 310 K.

ΔS is approximately 1.797 kJ/(mol·K).

So ΔG2 = (-5797) - (310)(1.797).

Calculate 310 * 1.797. Let's compute that. 300 *1.797 is 539.1, and 10 *1.797 is 17.97. So total is 539.1 +17.97 = 557.07 kJ/mol.

So ΔG2 = -5797 - 557.07 = -6354.07 kJ/mol.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because at higher temperature, for an exothermic reaction, the Gibbs free energy becomes more negative? Or does it depend on the entropy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Because, the equation is ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. So if temperature increases, and if ΔS is positive, then TΔS term increases, so ΔG becomes more negative if ΔH is negative and ΔS is positive.

Wait, in this case, ΔS was positive because (ΔH - ΔG) was positive. Let me double-check that.

Wait, at 298 K, ΔG1 = ΔH - T1ΔS.

ΔS = (ΔH - ΔG1) / T1.

ΔH is -5797, ΔG1 is -6333.

So (ΔH - ΔG1) is (-5797) - (-6333) = 536, which is positive. So ΔS is positive.

So, when temperature increases, the TΔS term becomes larger. Since ΔS is positive, TΔS is positive, so subtracting a larger positive number from ΔH (which is negative) would make ΔG more negative.

Wait, but in the calculation above, when I computed ΔG2, I subtracted 557.07 from ΔH. So yes, that would make ΔG more negative than before.

Wait, but the original ΔG1 was -6333 kJ/mol. Now, at 310 K, ΔG2 is -6354 kJ/mol.

So the change in ΔG would be ΔG2 - ΔG1 = (-6354) - (-6333) = (-6354 +6333) = -21 kJ/mol.

Wait, but the question is about the additional non-expansion work. So, the change in Gibbs energy is -21 kJ/mol, which would mean that the work available increases by 21 kJ/mol, but wait, the question states "additional non-expansion work that may be obtained by raising the temperature." So if at higher temperature, the ΔG is more negative, that would imply more work can be extracted.

Wait, but wait, the options are negative values. So perhaps I'm missing a sign here. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula for maximum non-expansion work is ΔG, and if ΔG becomes more negative, that means more work can be done. So the additional work is the difference between the two ΔG values.

So the additional work would be ΔG(310) - ΔG(298) = (-6354) - (-6333) = -21 kJ/mol. But wait, that's a negative number, but more negative. So the change is -21 kJ, which would imply that the Gibbs energy is 21 kJ more negative, so the work is 21 kJ more available.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "additional non-expansion work that may be obtained by raising the temperature." So if at higher temperature, the Gibbs energy is more negative, then the work that can be obtained increases. So the change is a negative number. So the additional work is -21 kJ/mol. But looking at the options, option E is -21.

Wait, but wait, the options are in kJ/mol, and E is -21. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but wait, let me check the calculation again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

ΔG1 at 298 K: -6333.

ΔS = (ΔH - ΔG1)/T1 = ( (-5797) - (-6333) ) / 298 = (536) / 298 ≈ 1.797 kJ/(mol·K).

Then, ΔG2 at 310 K = ΔH - T2 * ΔS = (-5797) - (310)(1.797).

Calculating 310 * 1.797:

300 * 1.797 = 539.1.

10 *1.797 = 17.97.

Total is 539.1 +17.97 = 557.07.

So ΔG2 = -5797 - 557.07 = -6354.07.

So the change is ΔG2 - ΔG1 = (-6354.07) - (-6333) = -6354.07 +6333 = -21.07 kJ/mol.

So approximately -21 kJ/mol, which is option E.

But wait, the question says "additional non-expansion work that may be obtained by raising the temperature." So, if the Gibbs energy becomes more negative by 21 kJ/mol, that means the system can do 21 kJ more work. So the additional work is -21 kJ? Or is it +21? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused about the sign.

Wait, the Gibbs free energy is the maximum non-expansion work. So if at 298 K, it's -6333, and at 310 K, it's -6354, that's a change of -21. So the work available is 21 kJ more negative, which implies that the system can do 21 kJ more work. So the additional work is 21 kJ, but the way the question is phrased, perhaps the answer is -21, because it's the change in Gibbs energy.

But in terms of work obtained, the change in Gibbs would be the additional work. So from 298 to 310, the Gibbs became -21 kJ more negative. So the additional work is -21 kJ, which would correspond to option E.

Alternatively, perhaps I have the sign wrong. Because work done by the system is negative, or work done on the system is positive. Hmm, maybe I should double-check that.

Wait, in thermodynamics, the sign of ΔG indicates the spontaneity. A negative ΔG means the process is spontaneous and can do work. The maximum work is equal to ΔG when the process is reversible.

So when temperature increases from 298 to 310, ΔG becomes more negative, so the maximum work increases by 21 kJ. So the additional work is 21 kJ, but the options have negative values. Hmm, wait, perhaps the question is considering the additional work as the difference, which is -21 kJ.

But looking at the options, E is -21, which would be the correct answer.

Another way to think: the change in Gibbs energy is -21 kJ/mol, which is the additional non-expansion work. So the answer is E.
</think>

To determine the additional non-expansion work obtained by raising the temperature from 298 K to 310 K, we use the relationship between Gibbs free energy (ΔG), enthalpy (ΔH), and entropy (ΔS):  

\[
\Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S
\]

### Step 1: Calculate ΔS at 298 K  
At 298 K, the standard Gibbs energy (\(\Delta G_1\)) and enthalpy (\(\Delta H\)) are given as:  
\[
\Delta G_1 = -6333 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}, \quad \Delta H = -5797 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}
\]

Using the equation \(\Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S\), we solve for \(\Delta S\):  
\[
\Delta S = \frac{\Delta H - \Delta G_1}{T_1}
\]

Substituting the values:  
\[
\Delta S = \frac{-5797 - (-6333)}{298} = \frac{536}{298} \approx 1.797 \, \mathrm{kJ/(mol \cdot K)}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate ΔG at 310 K  
At 310 K, the Gibbs free energy (\(\Delta G_2\)) is calculated using the same formula:  
\[
\Delta G_2 = \Delta H - T_2\Delta S
\]

Substituting the values:  
\[
\Delta G_2 = -5797 - (310)(1.797)
\]

First, calculate \(T_2\Delta S\):  
\[
310 \times 1.797 = 557.07 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}
\]

Now, calculate \(\Delta G_2\):  
\[
\Delta G_2 = -5797 - 557.07 = -6354.07 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the additional non-expansion work  
The additional non-expansion work is the difference in Gibbs free energy between 310 K and 298 K:  
\[
\Delta G_2 - \Delta G_1 = -6354.07 - (-6333) = -21.07 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}
\]

This value indicates that the Gibbs free energy becomes more negative by approximately \(-21 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}\), meaning 21 kJ more non-expansion work can be obtained at the higher temperature.

### Final Answer  
The additional non-expansion work that may be obtained by raising the temperature to 37°C is **-21 kJ/mol**, corresponding to **option E**.
