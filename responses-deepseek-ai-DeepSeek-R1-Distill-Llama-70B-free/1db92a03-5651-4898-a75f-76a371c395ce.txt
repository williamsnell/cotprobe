Okay, so I've got this problem here about the compressibility factor of carbon dioxide. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question gives me an equation of state for CO2: [P + (n/(V² T^(1/2)))] (v - m) = RT. Wait, I'm not super familiar with this specific equation, but I think it's a form of a cubic equation of state, maybe similar to van der Waals but with different terms.

The problem states that the critical pressure (Pc) and temperature (Tc) for CO2 are 72.9 atm and 304.2 K, respectively. I remember that for the van der Waals equation, the critical constants relate to the equation's parameters a and b. But this equation here looks a bit different. Let me think—maybe I can rewrite it or compare it to van der Waals to find the constants.

Wait, the equation is P + (n/(V² T^(1/2))) multiplied by (v - m) equals RT. Let me try to rearrange this. So, expanding it, P*(v - m) + n (v - m)/(V² T^(1/2)) = RT. Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Maybe I should express it as P = [RT/(v - m)] - [n/(V² T^(1/2))]. 

Wait, but the problem is asking for the compressibility factor Z, which is Pv/RT. Right, because Z = Pv/(RT). So maybe I can express P from the equation and then substitute into Z.

Let me try that. From the equation:

P = [RT/(v - m)] - [n/(V² T^(1/2))]

So then, Z = Pv/RT = [v/(v - m)] - [n v / (R T^ 3/2 V² (v - m)) ].

Hmm, that's getting a bit complicated. Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Another thought: maybe I can find the constants n and m using the critical point.

I remember that for an equation of state, at the critical point, the first and second derivatives of P with respect to v (at constant T) are zero. So, (∂P/∂v)_T =0 and (∂²P/∂v²)_T =0. Maybe I can apply that here.

Wait, but what's v here? Oh, right, in thermodynamics, v is the molar volume, but in this problem, the volume given is per kilogram. Wait, no, the problem states the volume is 6.948 dm³/kg, which is specific volume. So I need to convert that to molar volume. Let me think about that later.

But focusing on finding n and m first. Let me write the equation again:

P = [RT/(v - m)] - [n/(V² T^(1/2))]

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in the variables. The original equation is written as [P + (n/(V² T^(1/2)))] (v - m) = RT.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the equation as P = [RT/(v - m)] - [n/(V² T^(1/2))], as I did before.

But maybe I should express it in terms of molar volume. Let me clarify the variables. Sometimes, in equations of state, V is molar volume (volume per mole), so v would be molar volume. But in this problem, the given volume is per kilogram. Right, so I need to convert that to molar volume.

Wait, let me get back to finding n and m. At the critical point, the equation should satisfy certain conditions. Let me assume that the equation is similar to van der Waals, which has the form (P + a (n/V)^2)(V/n - b) = RT. But here, the equation is different. Alternatively, maybe I can express the given equation in terms of the van der Waals form to find a and b, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation given is a modified van der Waals equation. Let me think about the van der Waals equation: (P + a (n²/V²))(V/n - b) = RT. In this problem, the equation is [P + (n/(V² T^(1/2)))] (v - m) = RT. So perhaps comparing terms:

In van der Waals: a (n²/V²) → in this equation: n/(V² T^(1/2)).

So a (n²/V²) = n/(V² T^(1/2)), which suggests a = 1/(n T^(1/2)).

But I'm not sure if this approach is correct. Maybe I need to find n and m using the critical point.

At critical point, the equation should hold with P = Pc, T = Tc, and v = Vc (critical molar volume). Let me denote Vc as the molar volume at critical point.

Wait, but I don't know Vc. Alternatively, perhaps I can find it from the critical constants using some relation. I remember for van der Waals, Vc = 3nb, but I'm not sure if that applies here.

Wait, perhaps I can express the equation in terms of the critical constants. Let me see, for a general cubic equation, the critical pressure and temperature can be expressed in terms of the equation's parameters.

But maybe I should use the fact that at the critical point, (dP/dv)_T = 0 and (d²P/dv²)_T = 0.

So, let's compute P from the given equation:

P = [RT/(v - m)] - [n/(V² T^(1/2))]

Wait, wait a second. The term V in the equation—it's the volume per mole, so V is volume per mole, so V is in dm³/mol. But in the given equation, the term is V squared times T to the 1/2. Hmm, but in the equation, the term is (n/(V² T^(1/2))). Wait, perhaps I should clarify whether V is molar volume or total volume. The equation uses V, but in the problem, the volume given is 6.948 dm³/kg. Hmm, maybe I should be using specific volume (volume per unit mass), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps V is the molar volume, so I need to convert the given specific volume to molar volume.

Wait, maybe I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to approach this differently. Since the question gives me the critical pressure and temperature, maybe I can express the equation in terms of the critical constants and solve for n and m.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make this equation look like the van der Waals equation by making some substitutions. Let me try that.

The van der Waals equation is [P + a (n²/V²)] (V/n - b) = RT. Comparing to the given equation: [P + (n/(V² T^(1/2}))] (v - m) = RT.

Wait, in the given equation, (v - m) is the term, which is similar to (V/n - b) in van der Waals, but V is molar volume, so (V/n)=v. So perhaps in this equation, (v - m) is like (v - b), where m is analogous to b in van der Waals.

So comparing the two, the term added to P is (n/(V² T^(1/2))) in the given equation, which would correspond to a (n²/V²) in van der Waals. So,

a (n²/V²) = n/(V² T^(1/2)) → a n² = n/(T^(1/2)) → a n = 1/(T^(1/2)).

But I'm not sure if this is the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the equation as a modified form and try to find the critical constants in terms of n and m. Let me attempt that.

At the critical point, the equation is:

[P_c + (n/(V_c² T_c^(1/2})}] (v_c - m) = R T_c.

But also, at the critical point, the first and second derivatives of P with respect to v (holding T constant) are zero. So let's compute those.

But wait, the equation is in terms of specific volume (v) perhaps, since the given volume is per kilogram. Hmm, maybe I should clarify whether v is specific volume or molar volume. Because in the problem, the volume given is 6.948 dm³/kg, which is specific volume, so in that case, v would be specific volume, and we need to handle that.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to convert everything to molar basis. Let me check the units.

Wait, the given volume is in dm³/kg, which is specific volume, so I'll need to find the molar mass of CO2 to convert it to molar volume.

Molar mass of CO2: carbon is about 12 g/mol, oxygen is 16, so 12 + 2*16 = 44 g/mol, which is 0.044 kg/mol.

So specific volume v = 6.948 dm³/kg → molar volume V = v * M = 6.948 dm³/kg * 0.044 kg/mol ≈ 0.3057 dm³/mol.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 6.948 * 0.044 = let's see: 6 * 0.044 is 0.264, 0.948 * 0.044 is approximately 0.0417, so total around 0.3057 dm³/mol. So V ≈ 0.3057 L/mol (since 1 dm³ = 1 L).

But wait, the critical molar volume is something I don't know. The problem gives Pc and Tc, so perhaps I should express V in terms of the critical constants.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to proceed step by step.

The equation provided is [P + (n/(V² T^(1/2}))] (v - m) = RT.

We can rearrange this as P = RT/(v - m) - n/(V² T^(1/2)).

But I'm not sure about the variables here. Wait, V is molar volume, so V = v * M, where v is specific volume (dm³/kg). Alternatively, perhaps in this equation, V is the total volume, so if I have mass in kg, then V would be in dm³, and v would be V per kg, so v = V/(mass). Hmm, maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of molar volume, so V is in dm³/mol.

Wait, perhaps I can express the equation in terms of specific variables. Let's denote the specific volume as v, which is V/m, where m is mass in kg. So V = v * m.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the variables. Maybe I should consider using the given data to find n and m.

So, the critical point is when T = Tc, P = Pc, and v = vc (specific volume at critical point). But I don't know vc, so maybe I can express it in terms of the gas constant R.

Wait, the problem is asking for the compressibility factor Z at T = 100°C, which is 373.15 K, and specific volume v = 6.948 dm³/kg.

Hmm, perhaps I can find Z by expressing P from the equation and then calculating Pv/RT.

So Z = Pv/(RT).

So I'll need to find P using the given equation of state, then compute Z.

But to find P, I need to know n and m, which are constants for the gas. So perhaps I can find n and m using the critical point data.

At critical point, T = Tc, P = Pc, and v = vc. So substituting into the equation:

[Pc + (n/(Vc² Tc^(1/2}))] (vc - m) = R Tc.

But I don't know Vc or vc. Hmm, maybe I can express Vc in terms of vc, since Vc = vc * Mc, where Mc is the molar mass. Wait, but Mc is 44 g/mol, as before, so 0.044 kg/mol. So Vc = vc * 0.044 dm³/mol.

Wait, but I don't know vc, so this seems like a dead end. Alternatively, perhaps I can find Vc from the critical constants using some relation from the equation of state.

Wait, perhaps I can find Vc in terms of R, Pc, and Tc by using the equation at the critical point. Let me try that.

At the critical point, substituting T = Tc, P = Pc, and v = vc into the equation:

[Pc + (n/(Vc² Tc^(1/2}))] (vc - m) = R Tc.

But this equation has two unknowns, n and m, and I need another equation to solve for them. The other equations come from the conditions on the derivatives.

So, taking the first derivative of P with respect to v at constant T and setting it to zero:

(∂P/∂v)_T = 0.

Similarly, the second derivative (∂²P/∂v²)_T = 0.

Let me compute these derivatives.

From the equation:

P = [RT/(v - m)] - [n/(V² T^(1/2))].

Wait, but V is a function of v and mass. Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating it. Alternatively, if I'm expressing everything on a per kilogram basis, then V = v, because V is specific volume. Wait, no, V is in dm³, and v is in dm³/kg, so V = v * mass. But if I'm considering it per kilogram, mass is 1 kg, so V = v dm³.

Wait, maybe I should express V as v, considering per kilogram. So for 1 kg, V = v.

So substituting V = v, the equation becomes:

P = [RT/(v - m)] - [n/(v² T^(1/2))].

Now, taking the derivative of P with respect to v at constant T:

dP/dv = -RT/(v - m)^2 + [2n/(v^3 T^(1/2))].

At the critical point, this equals zero:

-RTc/(vc - m)^2 + [2n/(vc^3 Tc^(1/2))] = 0.

Similarly, the second derivative:

d²P/dv² = 2 RTc/(v - m)^3 - [6n/(v^4 T^(1/2))].

At the critical point, this is also zero:

2 RTc/(vc - m)^3 - [6n/(vc^4 Tc^(1/2))] = 0.

So now I have three equations:

1. From the equation of state at critical point: [Pc + (n/(vc² Tc^(1/2}))] (vc - m) = R Tc.

2. First derivative: - RTc/(vc - m)^2 + [2n/(vc^3 Tc^(1/2))] = 0.

3. Second derivative: 2 RTc/(vc - m)^3 - [6n/(vc^4 Tc^(1/2))] = 0.

Hmm, that's a system of three equations with three unknowns: vc, m, n. Let me see if I can solve this.

From equation 2:

- RTc/(vc - m)^2 + [2n/(vc^3 Tc^(1/2))] = 0.

Let me rearrange this:

RTc/(vc - m)^2 = 2n/(vc^3 Tc^(1/2)).

Multiply both sides by vc^3 Tc^(1/2) (vc - m)^2:

RTc * vc^3 Tc^(1/2) = 2n (vc - m)^2.

Simplify left side: R Tc^(3/2) vc^3.

So,

R Tc^(3/2) vc^3 = 2n (vc - m)^2.

Similarly, from equation 3:

2 RTc/(vc - m)^3 = 6n/(vc^4 Tc^(1/2)).

Simplify:

2 RTc/(vc - m)^3 = 6n/(vc^4 Tc^(1/2)).

Multiply both sides by (vc - m)^3 vc^4 Tc^(1/2):

2 RTc vc^4 Tc^(1/2) = 6n (vc - m)^3.

Simplify left side: 2 R Tc^(3/2) vc^4.

So,

2 R Tc^(3/2) vc^4 = 6n (vc - m)^3.

Now, from equation 2, I have an expression for n:

n = [R Tc^(3/2) vc^3] / [2 (vc - m)^2 ].

Substitute this into equation 3's expression:

2 R Tc^(3/2) vc^4 = 6 * [R Tc^(3/2) vc^3 / (2 (vc - m)^2 ) ] * (vc - m)^3.

Simplify RHS:

6 * [ R Tc^(3/2) vc^3 / (2 (vc - m)^2) ) ] * (vc - m)^3

= 6 * R Tc^(3/2) vc^3 * (vc - m) / 2

= 3 R Tc^(3/2) vc^3 (vc - m).

So equation 3 becomes:

2 R Tc^(3/2) vc^4 = 3 R Tc^(3/2) vc^3 (vc - m).

Divide both sides by R Tc^(3/2) vc^3:

2 vc = 3 (vc - m).

Simplify:

2 vc = 3 vc - 3 m → 2 vc - 3 vc = -3 m → -vc = -3 m → vc = 3 m.

So m = vc / 3.

Now, substitute back into the expression for n from equation 2.

n = [ R Tc^(3/2) vc^3 ] / [ 2 (vc - m)^2 ]

But m = vc/3, so vc - m = vc - vc/3 = (2/3) vc.

So,

n = [ R Tc^(3/2) vc^3 ] / [ 2 ( (2/3) vc )^2 ]

= [ R Tc^(3/2
