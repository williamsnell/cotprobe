Question:

Say the incidence of a disease D is about 5 cases per 100 people (i.e., P(D) = 0.05). Let Boolean random variable D mean a patient “has disease D” and let Boolean random variable TP stand for "tests positive." Tests for disease D are known to be very accurate in the sense that the probability of testing positive when you have the disease is 0.99, and the probability of testing negative when you do not have the disease is 0.97. What is P(TP), the prior probability of testing positive.

A: 0.051
B: 0.091
C: 0.0368
D: 0.025
E: None of the above
F: 0.473
G: All of the above
H: 0.099
I: 0.078
J: 0.065

Okay, so I've got this probability question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The scenario is about a disease D with an incidence of 5 cases per 100 people. So, P(D) is 0.05. That makes sense; that's like saying 5% of the population has the disease. Then there's this Boolean variable TP, which means the test comes back positive. 

The question gives me some test accuracy numbers. It says that the probability of testing positive when you have the disease is 0.99. Oh right, that's the sensitivity of the test. And the probability of testing negative when you don't have the disease is 0.97, which I think is the specificity. 

So, we're being asked to find P(TP), the prior probability of testing positive. Hmm, prior probably usually refers to before considering any other information, so probably just based on the prevalence and the test characteristics.

I remember that to find the total probability of testing positive, I should consider both true positives and false positives. Because even people without the disease can test positive sometimes.

Let me break it down. 

First, the probability that a person has the disease is 0.05. If they have the disease and test positive, that's a true positive. So the probability of true positive is P(D) * P(TP|D) = 0.05 * 0.99. Let me calculate that: 0.05 * 0.99 is 0.0495.

Then, the probability that a person does not have the disease is 1 - P(D) = 0.95. But some of these people will test positive anyway; that's the false positive rate. The question gives the probability of testing negative when you don't have the disease as 0.97, so the false positive rate must be 1 - 0.97 = 0.03. So the probability of false positive is P(~D) * P(TP|~D) = 0.95 * 0.03. Let me compute that: 0.95 * 0.03 is 0.0285.

Now, the total probability of testing positive, P(TP), is the sum of the true positives and the false positives. So that's 0.0495 + 0.0285. Adding those together gives 0.078.

Wait, let me double-check my math. 0.0495 plus 0.0285: the 0.04 and 0.02 make 0.06, and 0.0095 + 0.0085 is 0.018. So 0.06 + 0.018 is 0.078. Yep, that's correct.

Looking at the options, option I is 0.078. So probably that's the correct answer.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any wrong assumptions. The question says P(TP|D)=0.99, which I used correctly. And P(not TP|~D)=0.97, so P(TP|~D)=0.03 is right. Then I multiplied by the respective probabilities of D and ~D. Yep, that's the law of total probability in action.

So I think I'm confident that the answer is option I.

To determine \( P(TP) \), the prior probability of testing positive, we consider both true positives and false positives. 

1. **True Positives**: The probability of having the disease is \( P(D) = 0.05 \), and the probability of testing positive given the disease is \( P(TP|D) = 0.99 \). Thus, the probability of a true positive is:
   \[
   P(D) \cdot P(TP|D) = 0.05 \cdot 0.99 = 0.0495
   \]

2. **False Positives**: The probability of not having the disease is \( P(\neg D) = 1 - P(D) = 0.95 \). The probability of testing positive given no disease is \( P(TP|\neg D) = 1 - P(\neg TP|\neg D) = 1 - 0.97 = 0.03 \). Thus, the probability of a false positive is:
   \[
   P(\neg D) \cdot P(TP|\neg D) = 0.95 \cdot 0.03 = 0.0285
   \]

3. **Total Probability of Testing Positive**: The total probability of testing positive is the sum of true positives and false positives:
   \[
   P(TP) = 0.0495 + 0.0285 = 0.078
   \]

From the given options, the correct answer is **I: 0.078**.
