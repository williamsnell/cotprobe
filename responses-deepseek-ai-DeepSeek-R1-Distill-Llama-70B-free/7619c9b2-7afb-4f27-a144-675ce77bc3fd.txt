Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this physics problem here. Let me read it carefully. The question is asking which of the given quantities decreases as the inverse square of the distance for distances far from the objects producing the fields. The options are A through G, each describing a different scenario involving electric or magnetic fields.

Hmm, I remember that the inverse square law applies to point sources or, in some cases, objects that can be approximated as point sources when you're far away. So I need to think about each option and whether their fields fall off as 1/r² at large distances.

Starting with option A: the magnetic field produced by an infinitely long, straight current-carrying wire. I think the magnetic field around a long straight wire is given by Ampère's law. The formula I remember is B = (μ₀ I)/(2π r), where r is the distance from the wire. So that's an inverse relationship, but only to the first power of r. So as r increases, B decreases like 1/r. Not inverse square, so A isn't the answer.

Option B: the magnetic field produced by a finite-length current-carrying wire. Oh wait, a finite wire is like a straight wire but with ends. At points far away from the wire, how does the field behave? I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think that for a finite wire, the magnetic field at a large distance would approximate that of a dipole. Dipole fields fall off with the inverse cube of the distance, right? Or wait, no, wait. Wait, the dipole's field goes like 1/r³ for the individual components, but maybe for large distances, the field from a finite wire might behave differently. Alternatively, since the wire isn't infinitely long, the field might not be as strong as the infinite case, but I'm not sure if it follows inverse square. I think I might have to come back to this one.

Option C: the magnetic field produced by a current loop. Ah, yes, I remember that the magnetic field due to a current loop at a distance r from its center (assuming r is much larger than the loop's size) behaves as a dipole. The dipole field falls off as 1/r³. So that's inverse cube, not square. So C is out.

Option D: the electric field produced by a finite-length charged rod. The electric field due to a charged rod. Let's see, a finite rod would produce an electric field that, at a large distance, can be approximated by treating it as a point charge. Because at far distances, the rod's size is negligible compared to r, so the field would be like that of a point charge, which is E ∝ 1/r². So D is a possibility here.

Option E: the magnetic field produced by a uniformly magnetized infinite plane. Hmm, I'm trying to recall. I think that for an infinite plane with uniform magnetization, the field inside the material is uniform, but outside? Wait, no, when you have a magnetized material, the field can be considered as bound currents. For an infinite plane, the magnetic field outside would be similar to that of a solenoid or something else. Wait, maybe it's zero? Or perhaps it's uniform. Alternatively, I think that the field on the surface of an infinite magnetized plane is such that H is discontinuous, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, I might remember that the field inside the material is B = μ₀(M), but outside, perhaps the field decays differently. Wait, no, maybe for a plane, the external field doesn't fall off with distance because it's an infinite plane. So maybe the field doesn't decrease at all with distance, which would mean it doesn't follow inverse square. So E is probably not the answer.

Option F: the electric field produced by an infinite plane of charge. Right, Gauss's law tells us that for an infinite sheet of charge, the electric field is uniform and doesn't depend on distance. Because the flux through a Gaussian surface (a cylinder) depends only on the charge per unit area. So E is constant, doesn't decrease with r at all. So F is out.

Option G: the electric field produced by an infinitely long charged cylinder. For a cylinder, the electric field outside the cylinder (assuming it's uniformly charged) would depend on the charge per unit length. Using Gauss's law again, imagine a cylindrical Gaussian surface at radius r. The electric field would be E = (λ)/(2πε₀ r), so again, E is proportional to 1/r. So G isn't the answer either.

Wait, so let's go back to the options. The question is about quantities that decrease as inverse square, so 1/r². So which option has that?

Looking at the options again:

Option D: electric field from a finite rod. At far distances, the rod can be treated as a point charge, so E ∝ 1/r². So that fits.

Option B: magnetic field from a finite wire. I thought it might be dipole, which is 1/r³. So that's not inverse square.

So the answer should be D.

To determine which quantity decreases as the inverse square of distance (\(1/r^2\)) for distances far from the objects producing the fields, we analyze each option:

- **Option A**: The magnetic field produced by an infinitely long, straight current-carrying wire follows \(B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi r}\), which decreases as \(1/r\), not \(1/r^2\). Thus, this is not the answer.

- **Option B**: The magnetic field produced by a finite-length current-carrying wire approximates a dipole field at large distances. Dipole fields decrease as \(1/r^3\), not \(1/r^2\). Therefore, this is not the answer.

- **Option C**: The magnetic field produced by a current loop also behaves as a dipole field at large distances, decreasing as \(1/r^3\). Hence, this is not the answer.

- **Option D**: The electric field produced by a finite-length charged rod can be approximated as that of a point charge at large distances. The electric field due to a point charge decreases as \(1/r^2\), making this a valid candidate.

- **Option E**: The magnetic field produced by a uniformly magnetized infinite plane does not decrease with distance because the plane is infinite. Thus, this is not the answer.

- **Option F**: The electric field produced by an infinite plane of charge is uniform and does not decrease with distance, as it is constant. Therefore, this is not the answer.

- **Option G**: The electric field produced by an infinitely long charged cylinder decreases as \(1/r\), not \(1/r^2\), as derived from Gauss's law. Hence, this is not the answer.

The only quantity that decreases as the inverse square of distance is the electric field produced by a finite-length charged rod.
