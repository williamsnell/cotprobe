Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Alright, the question says that f(x) is an invertible function, and it's given that f(2) equals f inverse of 2, which is 4. And the question is asking for the value of f(f(2)). Hmm, okay, I need to find that.

Wait, let's break it down. So f is invertible, which means that f is a one-to-one function and has an inverse function f⁻¹. The inverse function basically undoes what f does. So if f(a) = b, then f⁻¹(b) = a.

The problem states that f(2) equals 4. That's straightforward. So when I plug in 2 into f, I get 4. So f(2) =4.

But then it also says that f inverse of 2 is 4. Wait, f⁻¹(2) =4. So that means that when I apply f inverse to 2, I get 4. But since f inverse is the inverse function, that implies that f(4) must be 2. Because if f⁻¹(2)=4, then f(4)=2. Oh right, because f and f⁻¹ undo each other.

So to recap: f(2)=4 and f⁻¹(2)=4 which implies f(4)=2.

Now the question is f(f(2)). Let's compute that step by step. f(2) is 4, so f(f(2)) is f(4). But from earlier, we found that f(4)=2. So f(f(2)) equals 2.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I should write down the steps to make sure I'm not making a mistake.

Given:
1. f is invertible, so f⁻¹ exists.
2. f(2) = 4.
3. f⁻¹(2) =4.

From 3, since f⁻¹(2)=4, applying f to both sides gives f(f⁻¹(2))=f(4). But f(f⁻¹(2)) is just 2 because applying a function after its inverse cancels them out. So 2 = f(4). So f(4)=2.

Now, compute f(f(2)):

f(2) is 4, so f(f(2)) = f(4) = 2.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one equals 2. Let's look at the options again.

Options:
A: f(4)
B: f(f⁻¹(2))
C: 1
D: f⁻¹(4)
E: f⁻¹(2)
F: 8
G: 16
H: 0
I: 2
J:4

So the value is 2, which is option I.

Wait, but just to make sure, let me consider any other possibilities. Did I make any wrong assumptions? Let's see.

Another approach: since f is invertible, f⁻¹(y) is the value x such that f(x)=y. So given that f(2)=4, that's clear. And f⁻¹(2) =4 means that f(4)=2. So f(f(2))=f(4)=2. Yep, that still holds.

Alternatively, let's think about what each option represents.

Option B is f(f⁻¹(2)). Well, f(f⁻¹(2)) is just 2, because applying f after f inverse cancels out. So B is 2, which is the same as option I. Wait, but the question is about f(f(2)), which is 2, so both B and I are 2. Wait, but no, let me look again.

Wait, no. Option B is f(f⁻¹(2)), which is 2, yes. And the correct answer is 2, which is option I. So why is option B present? Because it also equals 2. Hmm. So why isn't the answer B?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me think. The function composition: f(f(2)) is f(4) which is 2. So the correct answer is 2, which is option I. But option B is f(f⁻¹(2)) which is 2. So both B and I evaluate to 2. So that's confusing.

Wait, the options are:

A: f(4)
B: f(f⁻¹(2))
C:1
D: f⁻¹(4)
E: f⁻¹(2)
F:8
G:16
H:0
I:2
J:4

So in that case, both B and I evaluate to 2. But the question is asking for the value of f(f(2)), which is 2. So the correct answer would be option I, because that's the value 2. Option B is an expression that also equals 2, but the question is asking for the value, not which expression is equivalent.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "What is the value of f(f(2))?" So the answer is 2, which is option I. So the correct choice is I.

Alternatively, maybe I should check whether any of the other options simplify to the same thing.

Option B: f(f⁻¹(2)) equals 2, so that's correct. But the question is about f(f(2)), which we found to be 2, so the answer is I.

So the correct answer is I, which is 2.

Given that \( f(x) \) is an invertible function, we know the following:

1. \( f(2) = 4 \).
2. \( f^{-1}(2) = 4 \), which implies \( f(4) = 2 \).

The question asks for the value of \( f(f(2)) \). Let us compute this step by step:

- \( f(2) = 4 \).
- Therefore, \( f(f(2)) = f(4) \).
- From \( f(4) = 2 \), we conclude that \( f(f(2)) = 2 \).

Now, analyzing the options:

- **A: \( f(4) \)**: This equals 2, but the question asks for the value of \( f(f(2)) \), which is 2.
- **B: \( f(f^{-1}(2)) \)**: This simplifies to 2, as \( f(f^{-1}(2)) = 2 \).
- **C: 1**: Incorrect.
- **D: \( f^{-1}(4) \)**: This would be the value \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 4 \), which is not directly relevant here.
- **E: \( f^{-1}(2) \)**: This equals 4, which is not the value of \( f(f(2)) \).
- **F: 8**: Incorrect.
- **G: 16**: Incorrect.
- **H: 0**: Incorrect.
- **I: 2**: This matches the computed value of \( f(f(2)) \).
- **J: 4**: Incorrect.

While both **B** and **I** evaluate to 2, the question specifically asks for the value of \( f(f(2)) \), which is 2. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**I: 2**.
