Okay, I need to figure out the correct answer to this economics question. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a private closed economy, and I have to choose the correct statement from the options A to J.

First, I should recall what a closed economy means. A closed economy doesn't engage in international trade, so there's no export or import. That means all production is for domestic consumption and investment.

In a private closed economy, the key equation is saving (S) equals investment (I). Because in such an economy, there's no government sector or foreign sector, so the only use of savings is for investment. So, S = I must hold true at equilibrium.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is true in general, not necessarily at equilibrium. So let's go through each option.

Option A: Investment is always less than savings. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Because in equilibrium, S = I. But if the economy isn't in equilibrium, S could be more or less than I, right? So A isn't always true.

Option B: Saving is zero when consumption equals disposable income. Disposable income (Yd) is income after taxes and transfers. The basic formula is Yd = C + S, where C is consumption. So if C = Yd, then S must be zero. That makes sense because Yd - C = S, so S = Yd - C. If Yd = C, then Yd - C = 0, so S=0. So B is correct in that scenario.

Option C: Investment is always greater than savings. No, that contradicts the equilibrium condition. Because in equilibrium, they should be equal. So C isn't always true.

Option D: Saving is zero when consumption exceeds disposable income. If C > Yd, then S would be negative because S = Yd - C. So S would be negative, not zero. So D is incorrect.

Option E: The economy is in equilibrium when consumption equals saving. Consumption (C) equals saving (S)? Let me think. At equilibrium, Y = C + I. Also, S = I. But if C = S, and S=I, then Y = S + S = 2S. I'm not sure if that's necessarily the equilibrium condition. Equilibrium is when S = I, regardless of the relation between C and S.

Option F: The economy is in equilibrium when consumption exceeds saving. Again, equilibrium is when S=I. Whether C is greater than S depends on other factors, like how much income is saved. So F isn't necessarily correct.

Option G: Household saving can occasionally be negative. Saving is Yd - C. So if C > Yd, then saving (S) would be negative. Households can dissave, meaning they spend more than their disposable income, perhaps by borrowing or using savings. So G is correct.

Option H: Household saving is always equal to investment. In a closed economy, yes, because S = I when there's no government or foreign sector. So H is correct, but wait, is it always? Because in equilibrium, yes, but the question is which statement is true, not necessarily about equilibrium. Oh wait, the question is about which is true in the economy in general. So in a closed economy, S must equal I for equilibrium, but if the economy isn't in equilibrium, S and I could differ. But wait, in a closed economy without government, every period's S must equal I because Y = C + I and Y = C + S, so S=I. So H is correct.

Wait, but H says "Household saving is always equal to investment." So in the economy as a whole, S = I, but household saving could be different if there are other sectors. Wait, no, in a private closed economy, the only sectors are households and firms. So yes, household saving would be equal to investment. So H is correct.

But wait, let me think again. In a closed economy, the total saving is equal to investment. So S = I. So H is correct.

But looking at the options, let me see which ones are correct.

Option I: The economy is in equilibrium when investment equals saving. Yes, that's the equilibrium condition. So I is correct.

Option J: Household saving can never be negative. No, because if consumption exceeds disposable income, saving would be negative. So J is incorrect.

Now, the options to consider are B, G, H, I.

Wait, the question is which statement is true in a private closed economy.

So let's evaluate each option again.

Option B: Saving is zero when consumption equals disposable income. That's correct because S=Yd - C. If Yd=C, then S=0.

Option G: Household saving can occasionally be negative. Yes, when C>Yd, then S is negative.

Option H: Household saving is always equal to investment. In a closed economy with only private sector, yes. Because the saving equals investment.

Option I: The economy is in equilibrium when investment equals saving. Yes, that's the equilibrium condition.

Wait, the question is asking which is true. So multiple options could be correct, but the question is a multiple-choice with only one correct answer.

Looking back, let's see what each option says.

The question is about a private closed economy. So in a closed economy, national income Y equals C + I. Also, Y = C + S (since S is saving, which is Y - C). Hence, I must equal S. So in the economy as a whole, S = I. So in any period, S = I. So in equilibrium, and also outside, because it's an identity in a closed economy without government. Wait, no, in an open economy, S can differ from I because of net exports, but in a closed economy, S must always equal I.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing. Let me think again. In a closed economy, the saving equals investment because there's no other sector. So S = I is always true, regardless of equilibrium. So H says household saving is always equal to investment, which is correct. So H is correct.

But option I says the economy is in equilibrium when investment equals saving. But since S=I is always true in a closed economy, the equilibrium condition is automatically satisfied, so I think that statement is also correct. Wait, no. The equilibrium condition is when Y = C + I and S = I. But since S=I is always true, perhaps the equilibrium condition is met when Y = C + S, which is the same as Y = C + I. So the equilibrium condition is when the flows are balanced, but S=I is always true in a closed economy.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's go back to the options.

Option B: Correct.

Option G: Correct.

But the question is which statement is true.

Wait, the options are the possible correct statements.

So let me go through each option:

A: Investment is always less than savings.

No, because in a closed economy, S=I always. So A is wrong.

B: Saving equals zero when C = Yd. Yes, because S=Yd - C. So B is correct.

C: Investment always greater than S. No, S=I.

D: S=0 when C>Yd. No, because then S would be negative.

E: Economy in equilibrium when C=S. Hmm, not necessarily. Equilibrium is when S=I, which is always true in a closed economy. So E is not necessarily correct.

F: Economy in equilibrium when C>S. No, equilibrium is when S=I, regardless of C.

G: Household saving can be negative. Yes, when C>Yd.

H: Household saving is always equal to investment. Yes, because in a closed economy, S=I.

I: Economy is in equilibrium when I=S. Yes, but in a closed economy, I=S is always true, so the equilibrium is when Y=C+I, which is the same as Y=C+S. So I think I is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is true. So options B, G, H, I are possible.

Wait, but the question is which is true. Let me think again.

In a private closed economy:

- There is no government, so the only sectors are households and firms.

- So, Y = C + I.

Household's disposable income is Yd = Y - T. But wait, in a private closed economy, do we have taxes? Oh, the question says it's a private closed economy, but it doesn't specify whether there's a government. Wait, perhaps the economy includes the government sector or not? Hmm, the question says 'private' closed economy, which I think refers to no government. So Yd = Y because there are no taxes. So Yd = Y.

Wait, that might change things. If there's no government, then Yd = Y. So S = Yd - C = Y - C.

But Y = C + I, so S = (C + I) - C = I. So S = I is always true.

Thus, in this economy, S always equals I. So, looking at the options:

Option H: Household saving is always equal to investment. So yes, H is correct.

Option I: The economy is in equilibrium when investment equals saving. But since S=I is always true, the equilibrium condition is met when S=I. So I is correct.

Wait, but the equilibrium condition in this context is Y = C + I, which is always true because Y is the total output. So perhaps the equilibrium refers to when the economy is at the desired levels, but in macro terms, the identity holds regardless.

So, the correct statements are H and I. But looking at the options, only one can be correct. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let's think again. The question is about which statement is true.

Option I: The economy is in equilibrium when investment equals saving. Since in a closed economy, S=I is always true, every situation is equilibrium in that sense. So I is correct.

Option H says that household saving is always equal to investment. Since S=I is always true, H is correct.

But looking at the options, the correct answer would be H and I are both correct? But the options are A-J, and we have to choose one.

Wait, perhaps the question is about which is always true. So in a private closed economy, S=I is always true, so H is correct. But for equilibrium, it's when S=I, which is always true, so I is correct.

Wait, but in a closed economy, the equilibrium condition is S=I, which is always true, so the economy is always in equilibrium? That can't be right. Because equilibrium refers to a state where there's no tendency to change. So perhaps the correct statement is that the economy is in equilibrium when S=I, which is always true.

I think I'm getting stuck. Let me try a different approach. Let's think about each option.

Option I: The economy is in equilibrium when investment equals saving. Yes, that's correct because equilibrium is when S=I.

Option H: Household saving is always equal to investment. Yes, because in a closed economy, S=I is an identity.

So both H and I seem correct. But let me check what the options are.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

H: Household saving is always equal to investment.

I: The economy is in equilibrium when investment equals saving.

In a closed economy, S=I is always true, so H is correct. And I is correct because equilibrium is when S=I, which is always met. So both H and I are correct. But that can't be the case because the options are single choice.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think: In a closed economy without government, S=I is always true, regardless of equilibrium. So H is correct. But for equilibrium, the economy is always in equilibrium, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the correct answer is H.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is I because it's the condition for equilibrium. But in reality, in the closed economy, S=I is always true, so the economy is always in equilibrium, which isn't realistic. So perhaps the question is considering that in equilibrium, S=I.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is H and I. But the options are single choice.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and should look for other correct options.

Option G: Household saving can occasionally be negative. Yes, because if consumption exceeds disposable income, saving is negative.

So G is correct.

But the options are: which is true in a private closed economy.

So, what's the correct answer?

Let me think again. The correct statements are:

- S = I always (so H is correct)

- When C = Yd, S=0 (B is correct)

- When C>Yd, S is negative (so G is correct)

- The economy is in equilibrium when S=I, which is always true (so I is correct)

But the options don't allow multiple correct answers, so perhaps I need to reevaluate.

Wait, the question is a multiple-choice, and only one option is correct.

Looking back, perhaps the answer is H, I, and G are correct, but the options don't allow that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is G and H.

Wait, no, the options are only single letters. So perhaps I need to pick the best answer.

Wait, the options:

H: Household saving is always equal to investment.

I: The economy is in equilibrium when investment equals saving.

Since in a closed economy, S=I is always true, H is correct. So H is a true statement.

I is also correct because equilibrium is when S=I. So both H and I are correct. But the options don't have both, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the economy isn't necessarily in equilibrium, but in equilibrium, S=I. So I is correct.

But since S=I is always true, the economy is always in equilibrium, which may not be the intended answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is G: Household saving can occasionally be negative.

Because in a closed economy, if households spend more than their income, their saving is negative. So G is correct.

So, the correct options are:

B: Correct.

G: Correct.

H: Correct.

I: Correct.

But I have to choose one.

Wait, the question asks which statement is true.

So, for example, option B is correct because when C=Yd, S=0.

Option G is correct because S can be negative.

Option H is correct because S=I always.

Option I is correct because equilibrium is when S=I.

But which of these is an option in the given choices.

Looking back at the options, let's see:

Options are A-J.

The correct statements are B, G, H, I.

But the question is which is true, so perhaps multiple are correct, but the options are only single choice.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is H and I.

But since I have to choose, perhaps the intended answer is H and I are correct, but the options are separate.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H: Household saving is always equal to investment.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is I: The economy is in equilibrium when investment equals saving.

But in a closed economy, S=I is always true, so the economy is always in equilibrium, which might not be what the question is getting at.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is H.

But wait, another approach: In the absence of government, the equation is S = I. So H is correct.

Also, G is correct because S can be negative.

But the options are given, and I have to choose one.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is H and I.

But in the options, both are present.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is H and I.

But the question is multiple-choice, so the correct answer must be either H, I, G, or B.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H.

But I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should think about what each option says.

The question is about a private closed economy. So S=I is always true.

So, option H is correct.

Option I is correct because equilibrium is when S=I.

So both H and I are correct statements, but perhaps the question expects one answer.

Wait, perhaps the answer is H and I. But the options don't allow that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is H, because it's a statement about the equality between household saving and investment, which is always true.

Alternatively, the correct answer is I, because it's the equilibrium condition.

But the question is asking which statement is true, not which is the equilibrium condition.

So, since S=I is always true, H is correct.

Therefore, the correct answer is H.

But wait, another point: The question is about a private closed economy. In such an economy, the only source of savings is household savings, and all savings go into investment. So yes, H is correct.

So, the correct answer is H.

In a private closed economy, the key relationship is that saving (S) equals investment (I). This is because there is no government or foreign sector, so all savings are directed toward investment. Let’s analyze the options:

- **Option A**: "Investment is always less than savings." This is incorrect because, in a closed economy, S = I is always true.  
- **Option B**: "Saving is equal to zero when consumption equals disposable income." This is correct because saving (S) is defined as disposable income (Yd) minus consumption (C). If C = Yd, then S = Yd - C = 0.  
- **Option C**: "Investment is always greater than savings." This is incorrect because S = I is always true in a closed economy.  
- **Option D**: "Saving is equal to zero when consumption exceeds disposable income." This is incorrect because if C > Yd, saving (S) would be negative, not zero.  
- **Option E**: "The economy is in equilibrium when consumption equals saving." This is incorrect because equilibrium is determined by S = I, not by the relationship between consumption and saving.  
- **Option F**: "The economy is in equilibrium when consumption exceeds saving." This is incorrect because equilibrium depends on S = I, not on whether C > S.  
- **Option G**: "Household saving can occasionally be negative." This is correct because if consumption (C) exceeds disposable income (Yd), saving (S = Yd - C) becomes negative.  
- **Option H**: "Household saving is always equal to investment." This is correct because, in a closed economy, S = I is always true.  
- **Option I**: "The economy is in equilibrium when investment equals saving." This is correct because equilibrium is defined by the condition S = I.  
- **Option J**: "Household saving can never be negative." This is incorrect because saving can be negative if consumption exceeds disposable income.

While multiple options (B, G, H, I) are correct, the question asks for a single correct statement. The most fundamental and universally true statement in a private closed economy is that household saving is always equal to investment, as this is an identity in
