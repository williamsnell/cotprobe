The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Which of the following is a true statement?

Options:

A: An experiment is always more reliable than an observational study, regardless of design.
B: Cause-and-effect relationships can only be established through controlled experiments.
C: Increasing the sample size in an observational study can completely eliminate bias.
D: If properly designed, observational studies can establish cause-and-effect relationships just as strongly as properly designed experiments.
E: While properly designed experiments can strongly suggest cause-and-effect relationships, a complete census is the only way of establishing such a relationship.
F: Controlled experiments are often undertaken later to establish cause-and-effect relationships first suggested by observational studies.
G: A census is the least accurate method of establishing cause-and-effect relationships.
H: The sample size of an observational study has no impact on the potential bias.
I: Observational studies can never suggest cause-and-effect relationships.
J: A useful approach to overcome bias in observational studies is to increase the sample size.

Okay, I've got this multiple-choice question about experimental designs and observational studies. Hmm, I need to figure out which statement is true. Let me think through each option one by one.

The question is asking which statement is correct. Let's go through the options.

Option A: An experiment is always more reliable than an observational study, regardless of design. Wait, I remember that experiments are generally more reliable because they control variables and can establish causation. But does that mean they're always more reliable? Maybe not. If an observational study is really well-designed, like a cohort study, it might be quite reliable. But in general, experiments are better for causation. So maybe A is not entirely true because it says "always," which might be too strong.

Option B: Cause-and-effect relationships can only be established through controlled experiments. No, I think that's not right. Observational studies, like cohort or case-control studies, can suggest causation even without being experiments. They might not be as strong as experiments, but they can indicate cause-effect, especially with proper design and statistical analysis. So B is probably false.

Option C: Increasing the sample size in an observational study can completely eliminate bias. Hmm, no. Bias in studies isn't just about sample size. Even with a large sample, if there's selection bias or confounding variables, increasing the size won't remove that bias. It might reduce random error but not systematic bias. So C is incorrect.

Option D: If properly designed, observational studies can establish cause-and-effect relationships just as strongly as properly designed experiments. I'm a bit unsure about this. Experiments are the gold standard for causation because they control variables. Observational studies can suggest causation but can't be as definitive. So I don't think D is correct because it says they can be as strong, which I'm not sure about.

Option E: While properly designed experiments can strongly suggest cause-and-effect relationships, a complete census is the only way of establishing such a relationship. A census is collecting data from everyone in the population. That's not practical and also not necessary. Plus, experiments can establish causation without a census. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Controlled experiments are often undertaken later to establish cause-and-effect relationships first suggested by observational studies. Yes, that makes sense. Observational studies often find associations, and then experiments are done to test if there's causation. For example, seeing an association between a factor and disease in observational data leads to experiments (like RCTs) to confirm. So F sounds correct.

Option G: A census is the least accurate method of establishing cause-and-effect relationships. Well, a census is about data collection from the entire population, not about causation. It doesn't really relate to cause-effect, so I'm not sure about this. Maybe G is true because a census alone can't establish causation, but I'm not certain. But F seems more directly correct.

Option H: The sample size of an observational study has no impact on the potential bias. No, that's not right. A larger sample can reduce random error but not bias. So H is false.

Option I: Observational studies can never suggest cause-and-effect relationships. No, that's wrong. They can suggest, but not definitively prove. So I is incorrect.

Option J: A useful approach to overcome bias in observational studies is to increase the sample size. Wait, no. Increasing sample size affects variance and random error, not bias. Bias is about systematic error. So J is incorrect.

So the correct answer is F. Because experiments often come after observational studies suggest a possible causal link.

The correct answer is **F**. Controlled experiments are often conducted after observational studies suggest potential cause-and-effect relationships, as experiments are better suited to confirm causation.

F
