Okay, so I have this problem here about convertible debentures, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says: A $500 par-value convertible debenture is selling at $520. The conversion ratio is 20. We need to find the conversion price. The options are from A to J, with various prices. 

Hmm, I remember that convertible debentures can be converted into shares, and the conversion ratio or price is a key factor here. But wait, what's the difference between conversion ratio and conversion price? I think the conversion ratio is the number of shares you get for each bond, while the conversion price is the price per share when you convert. Or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, let me think.

Wait, I think the conversion ratio is stated as the number of shares you receive for each bond. So if the ratio is 20, you get 20 shares per bond. But sometimes, the conversion ratio might be expressed as the number of bonds needed to get a certain number of shares. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, I've heard that the conversion price is calculated by dividing the par value by the conversion ratio. Because the par value is the face value of the bond, and the conversion ratio tells you how many shares you get. So if the par is $500 and ratio is 20, then the conversion price per share would be 500 divided by 20. Let me do that math: 500 / 20 equals 25. So the conversion price is $25 per share. 

Wait, but the bond is selling at $520, which is higher than the par value. Does that matter for the conversion price? Oh, I think the conversion price is based on the par value, not the market price. Because the conversion price is the predetermined price at which you can convert the bond into stock, regardless of the current market price of the bond itself. So the selling price here probably doesn't affect the conversion price calculation.

Let me think again. Conversion price per share = par value / conversion ratio. So $500 / 20 is indeed $25. So the conversion price is $25. Looking at the options, option E is $25.00. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, the conversion ratio is given as the number of shares per bond. So if the ratio is 20, that means 20 shares for each bond. So each bond is worth 20 shares. So the conversion price per share would be the par value divided by the ratio. So yes, 500 / 20 =25. So E is correct.

I don't think the market price of the bond (520) affects the conversion price. Because the conversion price is fixed when the bond is issued, based on par value and the ratio. So yeah, the answer is E.
</think>

The conversion price is calculated by dividing the par value of the bond by the conversion ratio. Here, the par value is $500, and the conversion ratio is 20. Thus, the conversion price per share is:

\[
\text{Conversion Price} = \frac{\text{Par Value}}{\text{Conversion Ratio}} = \frac{500}{20} = 25
\]

The selling price of the bond ($520) does not affect the conversion price, as the conversion price is based on the par value and the predetermined conversion ratio. Therefore, the conversion price is $25.00, which corresponds to option E.

Answer: E
