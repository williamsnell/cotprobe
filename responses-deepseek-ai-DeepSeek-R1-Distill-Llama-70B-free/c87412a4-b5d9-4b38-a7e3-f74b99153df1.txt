Question:

Statement 1| We learn a classifier f by boosting weak learners h. The functional form of f’s decision boundary is the same as h’s, but with different parameters.

Statement 2| Cross validation can be used to select the number of iterations in boosting; this procedure may help reduce overfitting.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about boosting and cross-validation. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I'll look at Statement 1. It says that when we learn a classifier f by boosting weak learners h, the functional form of f's decision boundary is the same as h's, but with different parameters. For example, if h was a linear classifier, then f is also linear.

Hmm, boosting methods like AdaBoost combine multiple weak classifiers to create a strong classifier. The weak learners are typically simple models, like decision trees or linear classifiers. Each weak learner contributes to the final model, but the final model f is an ensemble. Wait, but the functional form of f is the same as each h? Let me think. If each h is a linear classifier, then each h is a linear decision boundary. The boosting process combines these linear models, perhaps through weighted voting or summing. So the final decision boundary of f would actually be a combination of multiple linear boundaries. Wait, but combining linear models doesn't necessarily result in a linear model. Or does it? Oh wait, no. For example, if you add multiple linear models (like in a sum), the result is still linear. Because linear models added together stay linear. Oh wait, that's true. So if each h is linear, then f, being a weighted sum of linear models, would also be linear. So Statement 1 is saying that f's decision boundary has the same form as h's but different parameters. So yes, that makes sense. So Statement 1 is true.

Now, Statement 2: Cross-validation can be used to select the number of iterations in boosting; this procedure may help reduce overfitting.

Boosting, especially methods like gradient boosting, often involves deciding how many trees or iterations to use. Too few might underfit, too many can overfit. Using cross-validation to determine the optimal number of iterations makes sense because it helps find the point where adding more iterations stops improving generalization performance. So yes, cross-validation can be used to select the number of iterations, which can prevent overfitting by stopping early. So Statement 2 is also true.

So both statements are true. Now looking at the options:

Option F is True, True. So the correct answer should be F.

The question evaluates two statements about boosting and cross-validation.

- **Statement 1**: Boosting combines weak learners (e.g., linear classifiers) into a strong classifier. If the weak learners are linear, the strong classifier remains linear because the sum of linear models is linear. Thus, Statement 1 is true.

- **Statement 2**: Cross-validation can determine the optimal number of boosting iterations, helping to prevent overfitting by identifying when additional iterations no longer improve performance. Thus, Statement 2 is also true.

Both statements are true, so the correct answer is:

F: True, True

Answer: F
