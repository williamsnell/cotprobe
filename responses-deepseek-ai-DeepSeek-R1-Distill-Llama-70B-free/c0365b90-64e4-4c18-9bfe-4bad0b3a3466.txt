Question:

This question refers to the following information.
I appeal to any white man to say, if ever he entered Logan's cabin hungry, and he gave him not meat: if ever he came cold and naked, and he clothed him not? During the course of the last long and bloody war, Logan remained idle in his cabin, an advocate for peace. Such was my love for the whites, that my countrymen pointed as they passed, and said, "Logan is the friend of the white man." I had even thought to have lived with you but for the injuries of one man. Colonel Cresap, the last spring, in cold blood and unprovoked; murdered all the relations of Logan, not even sparing my women and children. There runs not a drop of my blood in the veins of any living creature. This called on me for revenge. I have sought it: I have killed many; I have fully glutted my vengeance. For my country, I rejoice at the beams of peace. But do not harbor a thought that mine is the joy of fear. Logan never felt fear. He will not turn on his heel to save his life. Who is there to mourn for Logan? Not one.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Logan's Address and what policy a sympathetic reader would support. Let me break it down.

First, I remember that Logan's speech is pretty emotional. He talks about how he was a friend to the white man but was betrayed when Colonel Cresap killed his family. He's seeking revenge but also expresses a desire for peace. The key point is that he's mournful and feels wronged by the violence against his people.

Now, the question is about what policy someone who feels sympathy for Logan would support. So, I need to think about the options provided and which one aligns with someone feeling sorry for the injustices done to Native Americans.

Option A is about exterminating Indians. That seems really harsh and opposite of sympathy. So probably not A.

Option B talks about building reservations and encouraging change. I think reservations were often part of policies that forced Native Americans to adapt, sometimes against their will. Sympathetic people might not support this if they see it as forced.

Option C is integrating Indians into society. That could be seen as positive, but sometimes integration can mean loss of culture. Not sure if that's the best fit for someone sympathetic to Logan's plight.

Option D suggests moving them to Canada or Mexico. That doesn't seem like a compassionate solution; it's more like relocation, which has historically been traumatic.

Option E is creating a separate state. I'm not sure about that. It sounds like segregation, which might not be what a sympathetic person would want.

Option F is internment camps. Definitely not, since that's harsh and punitive.

Option G is respecting Indian territory and sovereignty. That sounds like it's about recognizing their rights and letting them govern themselves. That seems more in line with someone who feels for Logan's situation, wanting justice and respect.

Option H is financial compensation for land taken. While that's a form of restitution, the speech is more about the murder and betrayal, so maybe the focus is more on respect and stopping violence rather than just money.

Option I is ignoring them. That's the opposite of being sympathetic; you'd want to help, not ignore.

Option J is assimilation. Similar to C, it's about blending into white society, which might not respect their cultural identity.

So, putting it together, the most sympathetic approach would be respecting their sovereignty and territory. That would mean supporting their right to their land and self-governance without interference. So the correct answer is G.

A sympathetic reader of Logan's Address would likely support a policy that respects Native American rights and sovereignty. The address highlights betrayal, loss, and the desire for justice, suggesting that respecting Indian territory and sovereignty (Option G) is the most compassionate and just approach.
