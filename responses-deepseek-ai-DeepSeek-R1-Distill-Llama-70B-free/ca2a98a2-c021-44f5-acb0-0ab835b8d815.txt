Question:

Connie Computer decided to purchase a $1,000 laptop computer to use during law school. When she went into Computer Retailer Inc., the salesperson also sold her a 5-year service agreement for $1,200 for a total price of $2,200. Nine months later, the laptop stopped working and Computer Retailer refused to perform on their service agreement. If Connie sues Computer Retailer, the trial court will likely find for

Options:

A: Connie, under the common law because the predominate purpose for which the parties contracted was the sale of goods.
B: Connie, under the UCC only if the predominate reason for entering into the contract was for the goods portion of the contract.
C: Connie, under the UCC unless the predominate purpose of the agreement was for the service agreement portion of the contract.
D: Computer Retailer, if the court determines that the predominate purpose of the agreement is determined by intent and not the relative dollars assigned to the computer and the service agreement.

Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this contracts question. Let me read it again carefully. 

Connie bought a laptop for $1,000 and a 5-year service agreement for $1,200, totaling $2,200. The laptop broke after nine months, and the retailer refused to honor the service agreement. She's suing, and the question is about who the trial court will likely find for.

The options are A through D, each dealing with whether the case falls under common law or the UCC, and the predominant purpose of the contract.

First, I remember that the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) applies to sales of goods, while common law applies to services or other non-goods. But when a contract involves both goods and services, the court has to decide which part predominates.

The key is the "predominant purpose" test. If the main purpose is goods, UCC applies; if it's services, common law does.

In this case, Connie bought a laptop (a good) and a service agreement. The question is, which was the predominant purpose?

I think about the price: the laptop was $1,000, and the service was $1,200. So the service was actually more expensive. But wait, sometimes the predominant factor isn't just the price. It's about what the contract was mainly for. If Connie bought the laptop and then the service as an add-on, maybe the main purpose is the goods. But if the service was the primary reason, like maybe she needed the service more than the laptop, but that doesn't make much sense because she's buying a laptop.

Wait, but the UCC says that if it's a mixed contract, like goods and services, the predominant purpose determines the applicable law. So if the main reason was to buy the laptop, UCC applies. If the service was the main reason, common law applies.

In the problem, the laptop is a good, so the UCC would normally apply to the sale. But the service agreement is a service. So the contract is mixed.

But wait, the service agreement is for the laptop. So maybe the service is ancillary to the goods. So the predominant purpose would be the sale of the laptop. So the contract is predominantly a goods contract, thus UCC applies.

Wait, but the options are about the outcome. Let's look at the options.

Option A: Connie wins under common law because the predominant purpose was sale of goods. Wait, no. If the predominant is goods, then UCC applies, not common law. So A can't be right because it's saying common law applies when goods are predominant.

Option B: Connie wins under UCC only if the predominant reason was goods. Hmm, because if UCC applies, then the service agreement would be part of the UCC as well, perhaps. Or maybe the service agreement is a service contract under common law. Wait, but the service is part of the same contract as the laptop. So if the predominant is goods, then the entire contract is under UCC. If the other way, then under common law.

Option C: Connie wins under UCC unless the predominant purpose was service. So if the service was predominant, it's common law, else UCC.

Option D: Computer Retailer wins if the court decides the predominant purpose is based on intent, not the dollars. So if the intent was more about the service, which might not be the case.

So the issue is whether the contract is predominantly for goods or services.

In my earlier thought, the laptop is the goods. The service is tied to the laptop. So the primary purpose is the sale of the laptop, so UCC applies.

Wait, but the service agreement is for 5 years, which is longer than the laptop's typical lifespan, but that might not matter.

In the case law I remember, like when a contract is for both goods and services, the court looks at the predominant purpose. For example, buying a lamp (goods) with installation (service) is predominantly goods. But if the service is the main part, like a contract for both a computer and extensive training on how to use it, maybe that's more service-oriented.

In this problem, the service is a service agreement, which is to repair or replace the laptop if it breaks. So it's tied to the laptop. So maybe the predominant purpose is the laptop, making it a goods contract under UCC. Therefore, Connie can sue under UCC.

Looking at the options, if the predominant purpose is goods, then UCC applies. So the question is which option correctly states that.

Option C says Connie wins under UCC unless the predominant purpose was service. So if the service is predominant, then it's not UCC, but otherwise, UCC applies. That makes sense because if the service was the main part, then common law applies, otherwise UCC.

But wait, the service agreement is for $1,200, which is more than the laptop's price. Does that matter? I think courts sometimes look at the price, but the main factor is the intent and purpose. If the service is an add-on, then the predominant purpose is goods.

But in this case, the service is more expensive. So maybe the court would consider that the service was the main part. Hmm, that's a point of confusion.

Wait, the total is $2,200. Laptop is $1k, service $1.2k. So service is more in price. So maybe the predominant purpose is the service? But that's not necessarily the case. Because the laptop is a one-time purchase, and the service is spread over five years. But I'm not sure.

In the UCC, the rule is that if the contract is predominantly for goods, then the UCC applies. So even if the service part is more expensive, if the main purpose was to buy the laptop, then UCC applies.

So in the given options, the correct answer would be that Connie wins under UCC unless the predominant purpose was services.

Looking at the options, option C says exactly that: Connie wins under UCC unless the predominant purpose was service.

Option B says Connie wins under UCC only if the predominant reason was goods. So that's similar. Wait, B says "only if", which is different. So B is saying that Connie can win under UCC only in the case where the predominant was goods. But in reality, if the predominant is goods, then UCC applies, which would mean the service agreement is part of the UCC contract. So if the service agreement is part of the UCC, and the retailer breached, Connie would win under UCC.

But according to option C, Connie wins under UCC unless the predominant was service. So it's the same as saying if the predominant is goods, UCC applies, else common law.

So the correct answer is C.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the service was more expensive. So maybe the court would find that the service was the predominant part.

But I think the key is that the laptop is a good, and the service is an accessory to it. So the main purpose is to buy the laptop, and the service is just an add-on. So the predominant purpose is goods.

So the trial court would likely find for Connie under the UCC.

Looking back at the options, option C says Connie wins under UCC unless the predominant was service. So that's correct because if the service was predominant, then common law applies, but otherwise, UCC applies.

So the answer should be C.

To determine the outcome of the case, the court must decide whether the contract between Connie and Computer Retailer is predominantly for goods or services, as this determines whether the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) or common law applies. The UCC governs contracts where the predominant purpose is the sale of goods, while common law applies when the predominant purpose is services.

In this case, Connie purchased a laptop (a good) for $1,000 and a 5-year service agreement for $1,200. Although the service agreement is more expensive, the laptop is the primary item being purchased, and the service agreement is ancillary to it. Courts typically consider the intent of the parties and the nature of the contract, and in such cases, the predominant purpose is likely the sale of the laptop, making the contract subject to the UCC.

If the court finds that the predominant purpose is the sale of goods (the laptop), the UCC applies, and Connie can sue under it. However, if the court determines that the predominant purpose is the service agreement, common law would apply instead. Given the facts, the laptop appears to be the primary focus, so the UCC is likely to govern the contract.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** is incorrect because it states that common law applies when the predominant purpose is goods, which contradicts the rule that the UCC applies to goods.
- **Option B** is misleading because it suggests that Connie can only win under the UCC if the predominant purpose is goods, but it does not account for the possibility that the service could be predominant.
- **Option C** is correct because it accurately reflects that Connie will win under the UCC unless the court determines that the predominant purpose is the service agreement.
- **Option D** is incorrect because it focuses on intent rather than the predominant purpose, which is the key factor in determining the applicable law.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**C: Connie, under the UCC unless the predominant purpose of the agreement was for the service agreement portion of the contract.**
