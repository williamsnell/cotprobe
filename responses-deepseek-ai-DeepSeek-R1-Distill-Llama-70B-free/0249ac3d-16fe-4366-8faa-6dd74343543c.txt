Okay, so I have this problem about electrical machines, specifically dealing with armature windings and generated EMF. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has two main parts, (i) and (ii). Let's start with part (i)(a) and (b).

(i)(a) says: A triplex lap-wound armature is used in a 14-pole machine with fourteen brush sets, each spanning three commutator bars. Calculate the number of paths.

Hmm, I remember that in armature windings, the number of parallel paths depends on whether it's a lap or wave winding. For lap windings, the number of parallel paths (A) is equal to the number of poles (P) when it's a simplex lap winding. But wait, this is a triplex lap winding. Triplex means triple, so maybe it's three times the number of poles? Or perhaps it's something else.

Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Let me think again. In a lap winding, the number of parallel paths (A) is equal to the number of poles. So for a simplex lap winding, A = P. But when it's a triplex lap winding, the number of parallel paths would be 3 times P? Or is it P multiplied by the triplex factor? Wait, no, maybe triplex refers to the number of parallel circuits. Oh, wait! For lap windings, the number of parallel paths is always equal to the number of poles, regardless of whether it's simplex, duplex, or triplex. Or wait, no—wait, no, lap windings have A equal to the number of poles, but wave windings have A equal to 2, regardless of the number of poles.

Wait, let me clarify. In a simplex lap winding, the number of parallel paths is equal to the number of poles, so A = P. If it's a duplex lap winding, that would mean two parallel paths, but wait, no—that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the terms simplex, duplex, triplex refer to the number of parallel paths in wave windings, not lap. Because in lap windings, A is equal to P. In wave windings, A is typically 2, but maybe for multi-parallel, you get more paths. Hmm.

Wait, in a wave winding, the number of parallel paths is 2, regardless of the number of poles. But if it's a triplex wave winding, perhaps the number of paths increases. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the terminology. Let's think again.

Looking it up in my notes (in my mind), for lap windings, the number of parallel paths (A) equals the number of poles (P). For wave windings, A is 2. But in some cases, like when the number of poles is even, you might have different possibilities. Wait, but this problem is about a triplex lap-wound armature. Triplex suggests three parallel paths. Oh wait, no, maybe "triplex" refers to the number of parallel paths.

Wait, no, for lap windings, the number of parallel paths is equal to the number of poles. So for a 14-pole machine, A would be 14. But the problem says it's a triplex lap-wound, so maybe that affects it differently. Alternatively, perhaps "triplex" refers to the number of sets of brushes. Wait, the problem says fourteen brush sets, each spanning three commutator bars. Hmm.

Wait, wait. In a lap winding, the number of parallel paths is equal to the number of poles. So if P=14, then A=14. But the term 'triplex' here might indicate that each brush set is contributing to a certain number of paths. Hmm, maybe the number of parallel paths is more than P? Or perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the formula for number of paths in a lap winding. The number of parallel paths A = number of poles. So 14 poles would give 14 paths. But wait, the machine is triplex lap-wound, so maybe that's where the confusion is. Wait, another approach: the number of paths in a lap winding is P if it's simplex. But if it's triplex, perhaps A = (P × number of sets) / something.

Wait, no, I think the correct approach is that in a lap winding, the number of paths is equal to the number of poles. So regardless of whether it's simplex, duplex, or triplex, as long as it's a lap winding, A = P. So for part (a), A = 14 paths.

Wait, but the answer options don't have 14 for part (a). Let's check the options. Looking at the options, for part (a), the first number is the number of paths for part (i)(a). Let's see:

Option A: 35 paths for (a)
Option B:50
C:44
D:38
E:48
F:42
G:36
H:34
I:40
J:45

Hmm, none of them have 14. So my initial thought must be wrong. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, another possibility: the number of parallel paths in a lap winding is given by A = P × m, where m is the multiplex factor. So for simplex, m=1, A=P. For duplex, m=2, so A=2P. Triplex would have m=3, so A=3P. So for P=14, A=42? That would make (a) 42 paths.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. Wait, maybe the term "triplex lap-wound" implies that the winding is arranged such that it creates three parallel paths. But in a standard lap winding, the number of parallel paths is equal to the number of poles. So a 14-pole lap winding would have 14 parallel paths. So perhaps "triplex" here refers to the number of parallel paths per something else. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused between different terminologies.

Wait, another approach: the number of parallel paths in a lap winding is equal to the number of poles. So with 14 poles, it's 14 paths. But the problem says it's a triplex lap-wound armature. Maybe that's a typo and should be a wave winding? Alternatively, perhaps "triplex" refers to the number of sets of brushes. Each brush set spans three commutator bars.

Wait, the problem says fourteen brush sets, each spanning three commutator bars. Hmm, in a lap winding, the number of brush sets is equal to the number of poles. So for 14 poles, 14 brush sets. Each set spans a certain number of segments. The number of segments spanned by each brush set is equal to the number of commutator bars per path. Hmm, maybe I can find the number of paths based on that.

In a lap winding, each brush set spans (number of commutator bars per path), which is equal to (number of paths). Because in a lap winding, each path is connected in parallel, and the brushes collect current from all the parallel paths. So each brush set would span 1 commutator bar per path. Wait, no, perhaps the number of commutator bars spanned by each brush set is equal to the number of parallel paths.

Wait, wait, I think the formula is that the number of commutator bars spanned by each brush (C_b) is equal to the number of paths (A). So C_b = A.

So if each brush set spans three commutator bars, then the number of parallel paths A is 3. But wait, that doesn't make sense because in a lap winding with 14 poles, A should be 14. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up something.

Wait, perhaps in a triplex lap winding, the number of parallel paths is 3. So A=3. But then, how does that relate to the number of poles?

Alternatively, perhaps the number of parallel paths is determined by the number of brush sets and how many commutator bars each spans. Let me think: the number of parallel paths (A) in a lap winding is equal to the number of poles (P). So A = P. But in this case, the brush sets are spanning three bars each. Hmm, perhaps the number of paths is equal to the number of commutator bars per brush set. So if each brush set spans three bars, then A=3.

But wait, that would make part (a) have 3 paths, but looking at the answer options, few have 3 as the second part (i)(b), which is wave-wound. Hmm. Maybe I'm getting confused between lap and wave.

Wait, let's try part (i)(b) as well. It says: Repeat (a) for a triplex wave-wound armature having two such brush sets and 14 poles.

In a wave winding, the number of parallel paths is typically 2, but perhaps for a triplex wave winding, it's 3. Wait, but how does that work?

Wait, no, for a wave winding, the number of parallel paths is always 2, regardless of the number of poles, as long as the winding is a proper wave winding. So in part (b), for wave-wound, the number of paths would be 2. But the problem says it's a triplex wave-wound armature. So maybe that changes things. Alternatively, perhaps "triplex" in this context refers to the number of parallel paths, so A=3.

Wait, but if part (b) is a wave-wound with two brush sets, then each brush set would typically collect current from two parallel paths. So the number of parallel paths would be 2. But the problem states "triplex wave-wound", which might imply 3 paths. Alternatively, maybe the number is determined differently.

Wait, perhaps I should refer to the formula for the number of parallel paths in a lap and wave winding. The standard formula is:

For lap winding: A = P (the number of poles)
For wave winding: A = 2 (if the number of poles is even; if odd, it's different, but generally wave windings are used for even P)

But the problem states "triplex", which suggests more than two paths.

Wait, maybe "triplex" here refers to the number of sets of brushes. For instance, in a lap winding, each set of brushes is placed at the poles, so the number of brush sets equals the number of poles. But in a wave winding with two brush sets, it's more like a standard wave winding, which has A=2.

Wait, perhaps the term triplex implies that there are three parallel paths. So in part (b), a triplex wave-wound would have A=3 paths.

But wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try another approach. Let's think about how to determine the number of parallel paths.

In a lap winding, the number of parallel paths is equal to the number of poles. So part (a) is a 14-pole machine, so A=14. But the term "triplex" is confusing me. Alternatively, perhaps "triplex" refers to the number of parallel paths, so A=3. But that would conflict with the poles.

Wait, maybe in a lap winding, the number of parallel paths is the number of poles divided by the number of sets. Hmm, no, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps each brush set spans three commutator bars, and since the number of brush sets is 14, each spanning 3, maybe the number of paths is (number of brush sets × commutator bars per set) divided by the total number of commutator bars. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps in a lap winding, the number of parallel paths (A) is equal to the number of poles (P). So for part (a), P=14, so A=14. But the options don't have 14 for part (a). So maybe this approach is wrong.

Wait, another thought: The number of parallel paths in a lap winding is equal to the number of poles when the winding is simplex. But when it's a multi-parallel lap winding (like triplex), the number of paths increases. So perhaps A = P × m, where m is the number of parallel sets. So for triplex, m=3. So A=14 × 3=42. So part (a) would have 42 paths.

Looking at the options, option F has 42 for (a). So then part (a) is 42, and part (b) would be 3 paths? Or maybe something else.

Wait, for part (b), it's a triplex wave-wound armature with two brush sets. In a wave winding, the number of parallel paths is typically 2, but perhaps triplex makes it 3. Alternatively, if it's a triplex wave-wound, maybe A=3. So part (b) would have 3 paths.

But looking at the options, option F has for (a) 42, and for (b) 6 paths. That doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the number of parallel paths in a wave winding is determined by the number of brush sets. Each brush set in a wave winding typically has two brushes (positive and negative), so maybe the number of parallel paths is equal to the number of brush sets. If there are two brush sets, then A=2. But the problem says it's a triplex wave-wound, so perhaps A=3.

Alternatively, maybe in a wave winding, the number of parallel paths is 2, regardless of the number of brush sets. So part (b) would have A=2 paths.

But in the options, let's look for (a) as 42 and (b) as 6. Wait, no, let's see the options again.

Option F: (a) 42 paths, (b) 6 paths.

Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

In part (a), it's a lap winding, so A = P =14. But wait, the answer would be 14, but none of the options have that. So maybe I'm making a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the term 'triplex' refers to the number of parallel paths, so A=3. But that would make part (a) 3 paths. But that doesn't fit with lap windings. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the number of parallel paths is determined by the number of brush sets. Part (a) has 14 brush sets, each spanning 3 bars. So the number of paths A would be the number of brush sets × the number of bars each spans, divided by the total number of commutator bars. Wait, but I don't know the total number of commutator bars. Alternatively, perhaps the number of paths is the number of brush sets × the number of bars per set, but that also seems unclear.

Wait, maybe each brush set in a lap winding covers a certain number of commutator segments. The number of paths is equal to the number of commutator segments per brush set. So if each brush set spans three bars, then the number of paths is three. So for part (a), A=3, and for part (b), since it's a wave winding, A=2.

But then looking at the options, which have (a) and (b) as (42,6), (40,7), etc., this doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the formula for generated EMF, which is in part (ii). The formula is E = (P × Z × N × φ × 10^-6) / (60 × A × C), where Z is the number of armature conductors, N is the speed in rpm, φ is the flux per pole in lines, A is the number of parallel paths, and C is the number of turns per coil.

Wait, but maybe it's better to first tackle part (i) correctly.

Let me try to find the number of parallel paths for each case.

For part (i)(a): Triplex lap-wound, 14 poles, 14 brush sets, each spanning 3 commutator bars.

In a lap winding, the number of parallel paths (A) is equal to the number of poles (P). So A = P =14.

But the options don't have 14 for part (a), so perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps "triplex" indicates that the number of parallel paths is three times the number of poles. So A=3×14=42. So (a) would be 42 paths. Looking at the options, option F and E have 42 and 48 as the first number.

Wait, option F is (a) 42, (b) 6. Let's see if that makes sense.

In part (b), it's a triplex wave-wound armature with two brush sets. For wave windings, the number of parallel paths is typically 2, but maybe triplex makes it 3. Alternatively, since there are two brush sets, perhaps A=2.

But if part (b) is 6, that would require A=6. How could that be?

Wait, maybe in a wave winding, the number of parallel paths is equal to the number of brush sets multiplied by something. If there are two brush sets, and it's a triplex, perhaps each brush set contributes three paths, so A=2 × 3 =6. That would fit option F.

So, for part (i):

(a) Triplex lap-wound: A = 3 × 14 =42? Or perhaps another way. Alternatively, maybe in a triplex lap-wound, the number of parallel paths is P multiplied by the triplex factor. So A=14 ×3=42.

(b) Triplex wave-wound: In wave windings, the number of parallel paths is 2, but if it's triplex, maybe A=3? Or perhaps since there are two brush sets, each contributing 3 paths, so A=2 ×3=6.

If that's the case, part (i)(a) is 42, part (i)(b) is 6. Looking at the options, option F has (a)42, (b)6. So that could be the case.

Now moving to part (ii): Calculate the generated EMF for each case.

The given parameters are:

Flux per pole, φ =4.2 ×10^6 lines.

Speed, N=60 rpm.

Number of coils, C_armature =420 coils, each with 20 turns. So total number of conductors Z =420 ×20 ×2 = 420×40=16800? Wait, no, each coil has two conductors, so Z=420×2×20=16800 conductors? Or wait, each coil has 20 turns, meaning each loop is two conductors. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the number of armature conductors (Z) is calculated as the number of coils × number of turns
