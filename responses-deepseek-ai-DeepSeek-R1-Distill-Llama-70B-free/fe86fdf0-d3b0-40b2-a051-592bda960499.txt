Question:

What is the heat shock response ?

Options:

A: Heat shock is a response where cells decrease the overall transcription rate and maintain only vital functions at high temperatures
B: Heat shock is a response where cells increase the transcription of all genes uniformly in response to high temperatures
C: Heat shock is a response to cold temperatures
D: Heat shock is a response where cells only transcribe heat shock genes under normal temperature conditions
E: Heat shock is a response where cells stop transcribing the previously active genes and instead transcribe a new set of genes called heat shock genes when the temperature is raised.
F: Heat shock is a state where cells rapidly divide in response to high temperatures
G: Heat shock is a response where cells continue to transcribe the same genes despite high temperatures
H: Heat shock is a response where cells primarily transcribe heat shock genes in extremely low temperatures
I: Heat shock is a cellular process that repairs DNA damage caused by high temperatures without altering gene transcription
J: Heat shock is a gene mutation caused by high temperatures

Okay, so I've got this question about the heat shock response, and I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what I know about heat shock.

From what I remember, when cells undergo stress, like a sudden increase in temperature, they activate certain mechanisms to protect themselves. I think this is called the heat shock response. The main idea is that the cell adapts to the stress by changing which genes are expressed.

So the question is asking what exactly the heat shock response is. The options are A through J, each describing different scenarios. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A says that cells decrease overall transcription and maintain only vital functions. That sounds plausible because under stress, cells might focus on essential processes. But I remember that during heat shock, specific genes are turned on, not just a general decrease.

Option B suggests that all genes are transcribed uniformly. That doesn't sound right because the heat shock response is more about specific genes being activated, not all of them. Plus, increasing all transcription under stress doesn't make much sense because the cell would probably conserve resources.

Option C says it's a response to cold temperatures. Wait, no, I'm pretty sure heat shock is about high temperatures, not cold. Cold shock might be a different response, so C is probably wrong.

Option D claims that heat shock genes are only transcribed under normal temps. That can't be right because the name itself implies they're active during stress, not normal conditions. So D doesn't make sense.

Option E states that cells stop transcribing previous genes and switch to heat shock genes when temperature rises. This rings a bell. I think the cell halts most of its regular transcription to focus on producing heat shock proteins, which help protect the cell. So E seems correct.

Option F talks about rapid cell division in response to heat. That doesn't fit with what I know. Heat shock is more about survival, not division, so F is unlikely.

Option G says they keep transcribing the same genes despite high temps. That doesn't make sense because the cell needs to adapt, so G is probably wrong.

Option H mentions transcribing heat shock genes in low temps. Again, I think it's high temps, not low, so H is incorrect.

Option I describes repairing DNA without altering transcription. I don't think that's accurate because the heat shock response definitely involves changing gene expression to make new proteins.

Option J mentions a gene mutation from high temps. Heat shock is about the cell's response, not mutations, so J is wrong.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be E. Heat shock response involves stopping regular gene transcription and switching to heat shock genes when it's hot.

The heat shock response is a cellular defense mechanism activated in response to high temperatures. During this response, cells halt the transcription of their previously active genes and instead transcribe a specific set of genes known as heat shock genes. These genes produce heat shock proteins, which help protect the cell by repairing or stabilizing damaged proteins. This response is crucial for cellular survival under stress conditions.

Option E accurately describes this process, as it emphasizes the shift from normal gene transcription to the production of heat shock genes when the temperature rises.

Answer: E
