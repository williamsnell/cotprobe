Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this double jeopardy question. Let's start by breaking down the scenario step by step. 

The situation is about a drug dealer who was arrested after selling three grams of cocaine to undercover police. He was convicted in state court for possession with intent to distribute and got a 10-year sentence. His attorney is appealing, citing jury misconduct, so the case is on appeal right now. 

Then, while the appeal is pending, he gets indicted by both a federal and a state grand jury for conspiracy to distribute the same cocaine. His attorney is moving to dismiss both indictments on double jeopardy grounds. The question is which indictments should be dismissed.

I remember that double jeopardy protects against being tried twice for the same offense after jeopardy has attached. But here, there are two different jurisdictions involved: state and federal. I think the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment applies when the same sovereign prosecutes someone twice. So, if the state prosecutes someone, the federal government can still prosecute for the same conduct because they're separate sovereigns. This is known as the dual sovereignty doctrine.

Wait, but the initial case was a state conviction. Now, there are new indictments from state and federal. So, the state indictment might be a problem if the state is prosecuting again, but maybe the federal can still go forward.

Let me think about the timeline. He was convicted in state court, then appealed. While the appeal is pending, both the state and federal indictments happened. But when does double jeopardy attach? Once the trial starts, I think, so when the first trial began, jeopardy attached. If he's convicted and then the conviction is overturned on appeal, does that affect double jeopardy for subsequent prosecutions?

Wait, I think that if the conviction is reversed on appeal, then the case can be retried because the first trial's judgment is overturned. But in this case, the appeal is still pending. So, the state conviction is still in place unless the appeal overturns it.

Wait, the issue is about the new indictments after the initial conviction. So, the initial state prosecution resulted in a conviction. Now, the state is indicting him again for conspiracy, and the federal government is also indicting him for conspiracy. 

So, is the second state indictment for conspiracy a double jeopardy issue? Let's see. The initial charge was possession with intent to distribute. Now, the new charge is conspiracy to distribute. Are these the same offense? Or are they separate?

I remember that under the Blockburger test, if each offense requires proof of a different fact, they are not the same offense for double jeopardy purposes. So, possession with intent might require proof of possession and intent to distribute, while conspiracy requires an agreement to distribute. So, they might be different offenses. But I'm not entirely sure.

But wait, the initial case was in state court. The second state indictment is from the same sovereign, so if the first prosecution was for a different offense, maybe it's allowed. But if the same sovereign prosecutes twice for the same offense, that's a problem. But if the offenses are different, it's okay.

Alternatively, if the state is prosecuting again, does the first conviction bar the second? Or because the appeal is pending, maybe the first conviction isn't final yet. But regardless, the initial trial has concluded with a conviction, so double jeopardy would have attached, and a second prosecution by the same state would be barred unless it's for a different offense.

But the question is about the state's new indictment and the federal's. Since the federal government is a separate sovereign, they can prosecute regardless of the state's actions, as long as it's not the same offense. But since the initial state charge was possession with intent, and the federal is conspiracy, they are different, so federal prosecution is okay.

Wait, but the state's new indictment is also for conspiracy. If the state is prosecuting again, does that count as same sovereign? So, the state already convicted him for possession with intent. Now, they're charging him with conspiracy. Are these offenses the same under Blockburger? Let me think: Possession with intent requires possession and intent to distribute. Conspiracy requires an agreement to commit the crime. So, the elements are different. Therefore, the state can prosecute for conspiracy as a separate offense after convicting for possession.

Wait, but maybe the conduct is part of the same transaction. The initial sale was part of the conspiracy. So, perhaps the state's conspiracy charge is based on the same conduct as the possession charge. But under Blockburger, if each offense requires a different element, they can be prosecuted separately. So, the state might be allowed to prosecute both if the offenses are not the same.

But wait, in this scenario, the state is bringing a new indictment after the initial conviction. So, if the initial trial is done, and the state is now charging him again for a different offense, that's permissible under double jeopardy because they are separate offenses.

But wait, the initial case was possession with intent, which is a completed offense. Conspiracy is an inchoate offense. So, maybe they can be charged separately.

Alternatively, if the state's second indictment is based on the same conduct as the first, but for a different offense, then it's allowed. So, the state's new indictment (conspiracy) might not be barred. But the federal indictment, being a different sovereign, is definitely not barred.

Wait, but I'm getting confused because the state first prosecuted for possession, then after that, they're prosecuting for conspiracy. Are these the same offense? Let's apply Blockburger. 

Possession with intent: elements are possession of a controlled substance and intent to distribute.

Conspiracy: elements are an agreement to commit a crime (distribution) and overt act in furtherance.

So, each offense requires proof of a different fact. So, the state can prosecute both. Therefore, the state's indictment for conspiracy would not be barred by double jeopardy.

Wait, but I'm not so sure. Because the initial charge was for possession, and now it's conspiracy, which might be considered a lesser included offense or something else. Or maybe not. Because conspiracy requires an agreement, which possession doesn't necessarily involve. So, they are separate.

Therefore, the state's new indictment might not be dismissed on double jeopardy grounds because it's a different offense. Similarly, the federal indictment is from a different sovereign, so it's allowed regardless. Therefore, neither indictment would be dismissed.

Wait, but the initial state case is on appeal. Does that affect the double jeopardy analysis? Because if the conviction is overturned, the state might retry, but that's a different situation. But in this case, the state is bringing a new charge, not retrying the same one. So, the pending appeal doesn't affect the ability to bring a new charge for a different offense.

Wait, but the double jeopardy clause also applies to successive prosecutions for the same offense. So, the issue is whether the new charges are the same as the prior offense.

If the state's new conspiracy charge is based on the same conduct as the possession charge, but for a different offense, then it's allowed. So, the state can bring the conspiracy charge as a separate offense. Therefore, the state's indictment wouldn't be dismissed.

The federal indictment is a separate sovereign, so it's allowed regardless. So, neither indictment would be dismissed. That would mean the answer is E: neither of the indictments.

But wait, another angle: the initial state conviction is being appealed. If the appeal is successful and the conviction is overturned, then the state might have to retry the original charge. But that's not the case here. The appeal is pending, but the state is bringing a new charge. So, the state's new charge is a separate offense, so it's allowed.

Therefore, in all likelihood, double jeopardy doesn't require dismissal of either indictment. So, the answer would be E: neither of the indictments.

The double jeopardy clause protects against being tried twice for the same offense by the same sovereign after jeopardy has attached. In this scenario, the drug dealer was initially convicted in state court for possession with intent to distribute narcotics and is now facing new indictments from both state and federal authorities for conspiracy to distribute the same cocaine. The key issue is whether these new charges violate double jeopardy.

1. **State Indictment**: The initial state charge was for possession with intent to distribute, while the new charge is for conspiracy. Under the Blockburger test, if each offense requires proof of a different fact, they are not the same offense for double jeopardy purposes. Possession with intent requires proof of possession and intent to distribute, while conspiracy requires proof of an agreement to commit the crime. Since these offenses involve different elements, the state can prosecute the conspiracy charge separately without violating double jeopardy. Additionally, the pending appeal of the initial conviction does not affect the state's ability to bring a new charge for a different offense.

2. **Federal Indictment**: The federal government is a separate sovereign from the state, and under the dual sovereignty doctrine, it can prosecute for the same conduct as long as the charges involve different offenses. Since the federal indictment is for conspiracy, which is distinct from the state's initial charge of possession with intent, the federal prosecution is not barred by double jeopardy.

In conclusion, neither the state nor the federal indictment violates double jeopardy because the charges involve different offenses, and the federal government is a separate sovereign. Therefore, double jeopardy does not require the dismissal of either indictment.
