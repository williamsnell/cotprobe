Okay, so I'm trying to solve this DNA ratio problem. Let me read the question carefully. 

The question has three parts, (a), (b), and (c), each asking about different ratios in a DNA molecule and its complementary strand. Hmm, I remember that DNA strands are complementary, so the ratios should have some relationship based on that.

Starting with part (a): The [(A + T)/(G + C)] ratio of one strand is 0.2. I need to find this ratio in its complementary strand. 

Wait, DNA strands are antiparallel and complementary. So Adenine pairs with Thymine, and Guanine pairs with Cytosine. So in the complementary strand, A becomes T and vice versa, G becomes C and vice versa. 

But wait, the ratio given is (A+T)/(G+C). Let me think about what this ratio would look like in the complementary strand. Let's denote the original strand as strand 1, and the complementary as strand 2.

In strand 1: (A1 + T1)/(G1 + C1) = 0.2. 

What about in strand 2? In strand 2, A becomes T's complement, but wait, no, actually, the complementary strand has T where the original has A, and A where the original has T. Similarly, C and G switch places. So for the complementary strand, the number of A's would be equal to the number of T's in the original, and G's would equal C's. 

Wait, so strand 2's A+T would be equal to T1 + A1, which is A1 + T1, same as in strand 1. Similarly, G2 + C2 would be C1 + G1, same as G1 + C1. So the ratio (A+T)/(G+C) in strand 2 is the same as in strand 1? Because (A2 + T2) = (T1 + A1) = (A1 + T1), and (G2 + C2) = (C1 + G1) = (G1 + C1). So the ratio remains (A+T)/(G+C) = 0.2 in both strands. 

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, I think I might be making a mistake here. Let me think again. Because in the complementary strand, the amount of A is equal to T in the original, and T is equal to A in the original. So the sum (A+T) in the complementary strand would be T1 + A1, which is the same as A1 + T1. So the sum (A+T) doesn't change. Similarly, G and C's sum remains the same because G2 = C1 and C2 = G1. So their sum is G1 + C1. 

Wait, but that would mean that the (A+T)/(G+C) ratio is the same in both strands. So for part (a), the ratio in the complementary strand is also 0.2. So the answer to part (a) is 0.2? Wait, but looking at the options, let me check. 

Wait, let me re-express this. Let me denote the original strand as having a ratio of (A+T)/(G+C) = 0.2. Let me represent A, T, G, C as counts in the original strand. 

In the complementary strand:

- A' = T (because A pairs with T)
- T' = A
- G' = C
- C' = G

So in the complementary strand, (A' + T') = T + A = A + T. Similarly, (G' + C') = C + G = G + C.

So the ratio (A' + T') / (G' + C') = (A + T)/(G + C) = 0.2. So the complementary strand's ratio is also 0.2. So part (a) answer is 0.2?

Wait that can't be right because I thought maybe it's the inverse. Wait, no, because in the original, (A+T) is 0.2 times (G+C). So for the complementary strand, it's the same as the original. So (a) is 0.2.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me see what the possible answers are. The options for part (a) are:

Option A: (a) 1, etc.

Option B: (a) 0.5

Option C: (a) 1

Option D: (a) 0.2

Option E: (a)5

Hmm, so according to this, option D has (a) 0.2, which matches what I just thought. But wait, wait a second. Wait, in the original question, the ratio is given for one of the strands. So the complementary strand's ratio is the same as the original. So (a) is 0.2.

Wait but I'm now getting confused. Let me think again. Suppose a strand has (A+T)/(G+C) = 0.2. Then, the complementary strand will have (T+A)/(C+G). Which is (A+T)/(C+G) same as (A+T)/(G+C) because addition is commutative. So the ratio is the same. So (a) is 0.2.

Wait, but looking at the options, some have (a) as 0.2, like option D and I. So that's possible.

Moving to part (b): If 0.2 refers to [(A + G)/(T + C)] ratio, what is the ratio in the complementary strand?

Okay, so in this scenario, the ratio given is (A + G)/(T + C) = 0.2 for one strand. Now, let's find this ratio in the complementary strand.

Again, in the complementary strand, A becomes T's complement, so A' = T, T' = A, G' = C, C' = G.

So let's compute (A' + G')/(T' + C').

A' is T from original, G' is C from original. So A' + G' = T + C.

T' is A from original, C' is G from original. So T' + C' = A + G.

So the ratio becomes (T + C)/(A + G).

But wait, the original ratio was (A + G)/(T + C) = 0.2. So the reciprocal would be (T + C)/(A + G) = 1/0.2 = 5. So the complementary strand's ratio is 5. 

So part (b) is 5.

Now, part (c): What is the ratio of [(A + G)/(T + C)] in double-stranded DNA in (a) and (b)?

Wait, wait. Hmm. Double-stranded DNA would have both strands together. So each base in one strand is paired with its complement in the other. So for the entire DNA molecule (both strands), let's think about the total counts.

In any double-stranded DNA, the number of A equals T because each A in one strand pairs with T in the other. Similarly, G equals C. So, for the whole DNA:

A_total = T_total (since A in one strand is T in the other, and vice versa)
G_total = C_total.

So when considering the double-stranded DNA, the ratio [(A + G)/(T + C)] would be:

(A + G) / (T + C) = (A + G)/(A + G) ) because T = A and C = G. So this ratio is 1.

Wait, let me make sure. Let me define the counts in the two strands as:

Strand 1: A1, T1, G1, C1
Strand 2: T1, A1, C1, G1 (since it's complementary)

So in the double-stranded DNA, the total A is A1 + A2 = A1 + T1 (because A2 is T1 from strand 1). Similarly, total T is T1 + A1. So A_total = A1 + T1, T_total = T1 + A1, which are the same. Therefore, A_total = T_total.

Similarly, G_total = G1 + C1 (from strand 1 and 2). C_total = C1 + G1 (since in strand 2, C' = G1). So G_total = C_total.

So, the ratio (A + G) / (T + C) in double-stranded DNA is:

(A_total + G_total) / (T_total + C_total) = ( (A1 + T1) + (G1 + C1) ) / ( (A1 + T1) + (G1 + C1) ) = 1.

So for both scenarios (a) and (b), when considering the entire double-stranded DNA, the ratio is 1.

So putting it all together:

(a) 0.2

(b) 5

(c) 1

Looking at the options, let's check which one matches.

Option D: (a) 0.2, (b)5, (c)1. So that's the correct one.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option D says (a)0.2, (b)5, (c)1. Yes, that matches our findings. So the answer should be option D.

To solve the problem, we analyze the given ratios in the context of DNA strand complementarity and double-stranded DNA properties.

### Part (a)
The ratio \((A + T)/(G + C)\) of one strand is given as 0.2. Since DNA strands are complementary, the number of \(A\) in one strand equals \(T\) in the complementary strand, and the number of \(G\) equals \(C\). Therefore, the sum \((A + T)\) and \((G + C)\) remains the same in both strands. This means the ratio \((A + T)/(G + C)\) in the complementary strand is also **0.2**.

### Part (b)
If the ratio \((A + G)/(T + C)\) is 0.2 for one strand, we need to find this ratio in the complementary strand. In the complementary strand:
- \(A'\) (complementary \(A\)) equals \(T\),
- \(G'\) (complementary \(G\)) equals \(C\),
- \(T'\) (complementary \(T\)) equals \(A\),
- \(C'\) (complementary \(C\)) equals \(G\).

Thus, \((A' + G') = (T + C)\) and \((T' + C') = (A + G)\). The ratio becomes \((T + C)/(A + G)\), which is the reciprocal of the original ratio. Since the original ratio is 0.2, the reciprocal is \(1/0.2 = 5\). Therefore, the ratio in the complementary strand is **5**.

### Part (c)
In double-stranded DNA, the total counts of \(A\) and \(T\) are equal, and the total counts of \(G\) and \(C\) are equal due to base pairing. Thus, \((A + G)/(T + C) = (A + G)/(A + G) = 1\). This holds true for both scenarios (a) and (b). Therefore, the ratio in double-stranded DNA is **1**.

### Final Answer
Combining the results:
- (a) 0.2
- (b) 5
- (c) 1

The correct option is **D**.
