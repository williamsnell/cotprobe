Okay, so I've got this question about personnel selection, and I'm trying to figure out when it's appropriate to ask someone's age. Hmm, I remember that in many places, there are laws against age discrimination, so asking about age must be a sensitive topic. Let's look at the options.

Option A says it's okay if standardized test results show the incumbent doesn't have the aptitudes expected. Wait, does age relate to aptitude here? I think aptitude tests are about abilities, not age. So maybe this isn't the right reason to ask age.

Option B: age is a bona fide occupational requirement. Oh right, BFOR is a term I've heard before. It means that age is genuinely necessary for the job. Like, maybe a role that requires a certain level of maturity or physical ability that's age-related. So this seems like a valid reason.

Option C: intelligence and personality tests suggest poor future performance. I don't think age is directly tied to these test results. Plus, those tests are supposed to predict performance, not necessarily relate to age. So asking age here doesn't seem appropriate.

Option D: the interviewer is curious. Curiosity isn't a legal or valid reason. It's probably discriminatory, so this is definitely not appropriate.

Option E: for company demographics and statistics. I'm not sure. Collecting demographic data is common, but I think you can do that without directly asking age. Maybe through voluntary surveys or other methods that don't involve asking each individual during hiring.

Option F: nearing typical retirement age. Hmm, I don't think you can ask someone's age just because they're near retirement. That sounds like it could be discriminatory, assuming someone's retirement plans based on age.

Option G: company policy to hire only certain age groups. That sounds like outright age discrimination. Policies like that are probably illegal unless there's a BFOR, which would be covered under option B.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be B: when age is a bona fide occupational requirement. That makes sense because it's a legitimate, job-related reason, not just curiosity or demographics.

In personnel selection, asking about a person's age is generally sensitive due to laws against age discrimination. The correct scenario where it is appropriate is when age is a bona fide occupational requirement (BFOR), meaning it is genuinely necessary for the job. This could involve roles requiring specific physical abilities or maturity levels that are directly tied to age. Other options, such as curiosity, company demographics, or nearing retirement age, are not valid reasons and may be discriminatory.

Answer: B
