Options:

A: There will be more than 20 codons for 20 amino acids
B: 4 codons will be enough to code for all 20 amino acids, with some sharing multiple codons
C: 16 codons will be insufficient to code for all 20 amino acids
D: Each amino acid will have multiple codons, with a total of 40 codons available
E: There will be exactly one codon for each amino acid, with no redundancy
F: 25 codons will be available, providing extra combinations for some amino acids
G: Each amino acid will have its own unique codon
H: 16 codons will be enough to code for all 20 amino acids
I: There will be 64 codons, providing ample combinations for all amino acids and stop signals
J: 20 codons will be just enough to code for each amino acid uniquely

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about codons and amino acids. Let me start by recalling what I know about DNA and genetics. I remember that codons are sequences of nucleotides that code for specific amino acids. Normally, codons are three bases long, right? And since there are four possible nucleotides for each position (A, T, C, G), the number of possible codons is 4^3, which is 64. Oh wait, but out of those 64, some are stop codons, which don't code for amino acids. So that leaves us with 61 codons that actually code for the 20 amino acids. And because of that, many amino acids have multiple codons (redundancy), which is why the genetic code is degenerate.

But the question here is hypothetical. It's asking what if codons were only two bases long instead of three. So I need to calculate how many possible two-base codons there would be. Let's see, each position can be A, T, C, or G. So for two positions, that's 4 options for the first base and 4 for the second. So 4 x 4 equals 16 possible codons. Hmm, 16 is the total.

Now, there are 20 amino acids. So if there are only 16 codons, each codon would have to code for more than one amino acid. Wait, but 16 is less than 20, which means there aren't even enough codons for each amino acid to have at least one. So some amino acids would have to share codons, but wait, that might not even be possible because 16 is less than 20. So even if each codon coded for a unique amino acid, we'd only cover 16, leaving 4 amino acids without any codons. That can't be right. So that means there's insufficient number of codons.

Wait, the question is whether there would be sufficient codons for all 20 amino acids. So if we have only 16 possible two-base codons, and 20 amino acids, it's impossible because 16 is less than 20. So that means it's insufficient. So the answer should be that 16 codons are not enough.

Looking at the options now. Let me go through them:

Option A: More than 20 codons for 20 amino acids. Wait, with two bases, it's 16 codons, so A can't be right.

Option B: 4 codons enough. No, 4 is way too low. So B is wrong.

Option C: 16 codons will be insufficient. Yes, because 16 <20. So C seems correct.

Option D: Each amino acid has multiple codons with 40 total. Wait, 40 would require 40 codons, but with two bases it's only 16. So D is wrong.

Option E: Exactly one codon each. No, because 16 <20, so some would have none. E is wrong.

Option F: 25 codons available. Wait, 25 is more than 16, so that's not possible with two bases. F is wrong.

Option G: Each has unique codon. But as before, only 16, so no. G is wrong.

Option H: 16 enough for 20. No, because 16 is less than 20. So H is wrong.

Option I: 64 codons. That's the three-base case. So I is irrelevant here.

Option J: 20 codons each unique. But again, two bases only give 16, so J is wrong.

So the correct answer should be option C: 16 codons will be insufficient to code for all 20 amino acids.

To determine if two-base codons would provide enough combinations to code for all 20 amino acids, we calculate the number of possible codons. Each position in a two-base codon can be one of four nucleotides (A, T, C, G), resulting in \(4 \times 4 = 16\) possible codons. Since there are 20 amino acids, 16 codons are insufficient to uniquely code for all of them. This means some amino acids would have to share codons, but even then, 16 codons cannot cover all 20 amino acids. Therefore, two-base codons would not be sufficient.

Option C correctly states that 16 codons will be insufficient to code for all 20 amino acids.

Answer: C
