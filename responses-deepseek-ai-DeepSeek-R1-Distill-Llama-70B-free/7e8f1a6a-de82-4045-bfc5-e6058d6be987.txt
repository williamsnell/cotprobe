Okay, so I have this question about life insurance policies, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is comparing the cost of a $5,000 20-payment life insurance policy for two men: one is 25 years old, the other is 45. Assuming both live for the term of the policy, which option correctly shows their costs?

Hmm, I remember that life insurance policies can have different structures, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think. There are term life and whole life policies, right? Term life covers a specific period, while whole life covers until death and has a cash value component.

Wait, the question mentions a 20-payment policy. So that probably means it's a 20-year term, where you pay premiums for 20 years, and if you die during that time, the beneficiary gets the death benefit. If you live beyond the term, there's no payout. But wait, some policies might have different structures. Oh, but wait, another thought: sometimes "20-payment life insurance" might refer to paying premiums for 20 years, but the coverage period could be longer, like until 65 or something. But the question says each lived for the term, so maybe it's a 20-year term where they pay each year for 20 years and the coverage is for those 20 years.

But wait, I think for term life insurance, the premium increases with age because the likelihood of death is higher. So a 25-year-old would pay lower premiums than a 45-year-old for the same death benefit.

Wait, the question is about the total cost. The policy is $5,000 death benefit. So each pays premiums over 20 years. Younger people have lower premiums because they're less likely to die, so their total cost (sum of all premiums) would be lower than that of an older person.

But wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about how life insurance premiums work. For term life, the premium is usually level, meaning it's the same each year for a certain period. But as you get older, those premiums increase. So a 25-year-old buying a 20-year term policy would have lower annual premiums than a 45-year-old buying the same term. Because at 45, the risk is higher, so the premium is higher.

Wait, but the question says "each lived for the term of the policy." So that means both will live through the 20 years, so the insurance company doesn't have to pay out the death benefit. So the total cost for each would be the sum of all their premium payments over 20 years.

So for the 25-year-old, each annual premium is lower than the 45-year-old's annual premium. So over 20 years, the younger man pays less in total.

Looking at the options, I need to find which option has the 25-year-old's total cost lower than the 45-year-old's.

Let me look at the options:

Option A: $3649 and $2207 → 25: 3649, 45:2207. Wait, that would mean the younger pays more? No, that doesn't make sense.

Option B: $2207 and $5000. So 25 pays 2207, 45 pays 5000. That makes sense because younger pays less.

Option C: $110.35 and $182.45. These look like annual premiums, not totals. But the question is about total cost.

Option D: $5000 each. No, that would mean same cost, but younger should pay less.

Option E: $1500 and $2500. So 25 pays 1500, 45 pays 2500. That fits, but I need to check other options.

Option F: 25 pays 182.45, 45 pays 110.35. That's the reverse, so no.

Option G: 4250 and 6250. So 25 pays less, 45 more. Possible.

Option H: 2207 and 3649. So 25 pays 2207, 45 pays 3649. That seems opposite of what I thought, because 25 should have lower. Wait, no, wait. Wait, if the 25-year-old pays less per year, over 20 years, his total would be less than the 45-year-old's.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the way the options are written, the first number is the young man (25), the second is the 45-year-old. So if 25's total is lower, the first number should be lower than the second.

So let's see options:

Option B: 2207 (25) and 5000 (45). So 2207 <5000. That fits.

Option E: 25 pays 1500, 45 pays 2500. So 1500 <2500. Also fits.

Option G: 4250 <6250. Also fits.

Option H: 2207 (25) and 3649 (45). 2207<3649. So 25's total is less.

Wait, but which one is correct? How do I determine which option is right.

Wait, perhaps I need to remember how the 20-payment life policy works. Maybe it's a type of whole life insurance where you pay for 20 years, and the coverage is for life, but the payments stop after 20 years. Or perhaps it's a term life where you pay for 20 years, and the coverage is term.

Wait, the question says "20-payment life insurance policy." So probably, it's a whole life policy where you pay for 20 years, but the coverage is for life. But the question says assuming each lives for the term of the policy. Hmm, that's a bit confusing because term life has a term, while whole life is until death. So perhaps the term is 20 years, meaning it's a 20-year term policy, and both live for those 20 years, so the insurance company doesn't pay out.

In that case, the total cost is the sum of the premiums over 20 years. So for term life, the premium is level for the term. So for a 25-year-old, the annual premium is lower than for a 45-year-old.

So the total cost for the younger would be 20 * (his annual premium), and for the older, 20*(his higher annual premium).

So in the options, we need to find where the first number (25's total) is lower than the second (45's).

Looking back:

Option B: 2207 and 5000 → 2207 <5000 → possible.

Option E: 1500 and 2500 → yes.

Option G: 4250 <6250 → yes.

Option H: 2207 <3649 → yes.

So which option is correct? I'm not sure. Maybe I need to think about how much a $5,000 policy would cost.

Wait, $5,000 is not a huge amount. Let's think about annual premiums. For a 20-year term, a 25-year-old might have an annual premium of, say, $50, so over 20 years, that's $1000. But looking at the options, the totals are higher. Like option E is 1500 and 2500. Option H is 2207 and 3649.

Wait, perhaps the 25-year-old's total is lower. Let me try to approximate. Let's say for a $5,000 policy, a 25-year-old might pay around $100 per year, totaling $2000 over 20 years. A 45-year-old might pay $200/year, so $4000 total. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.

Alternatively, maybe the 25-year-old pays $110 per year, totaling 2200, and the 45-year-old pays $182 per year, totaling 3640. Wait, that would make the 25's total lower.

Wait, looking at option H, it's 2207 and 3649. So that fits, with the 25-year-old paying less.

Wait, but in that case, the 25-year-old's total is 2207 and 45-year-old's is 3649. So the 25-year-old's total is lower. So option H is correct.

But wait, earlier I thought option B and E and G are possible. How do I decide?

Alternatively, perhaps the 20-payment refers to a type of policy where the total premium is higher for the younger because he's paying over more years, but that doesn't make sense because he's younger, so risk is lower.

Alternatively, I'm confusing level premiums with other factors.

Wait, perhaps the 20-payment life insurance is a limited pay whole life policy, where you pay for 20 years, and the policy covers you for life. But in that case, the total premium would be higher than term life because it's a whole life policy. But the question is about comparing two 20-payment policies, so the structure is same, just age difference.

In any case, the younger person would have a lower total cost because their annual premiums are lower, and they pay the same number of years (20). So the total would be 20 * lower annual = lower total.

Looking back at the options, the correct one should have the first number (25) lower than the second (45).

So looking at the options:

Option B: 2207 <5000 → yes.

Option E: 1500 <2500 → yes.

Option G:4250 <6250 → yes.

Option H:2207 <3649 → yes.

So which one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the actual numbers are calculated. Let me think if I can compute it.

The total premium paid is the annual premium times 20.

Assuming that the insurance company's cost is based on the expected death benefit payment. For a term policy, the premium is based on the likelihood of the insured dying during the term.

The cost (premium) can be calculated using the formula:

PV of Premiums = Death Benefit

But wait, that's for actuarial calculations. Alternatively, the annual premium can be calculated based on mortality rates and interest rates.

But I don't have the exact mortality table or interest rates, so perhaps I should think in terms of what makes sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the younger man's total is lower, so among the options, the first number should be lower than the second.

Looking at all the options where first is lower than second:

Options B, E, G, H.

Now which among these is correct.

Wait, let's think about the face value. It's $5,000. If the 25-year-old pays a total of, say, $2207 over 20 years, that's about $110 per year. The 45-year-old would pay $3649, which is about $182 per year.

Wait, looking at option C, the numbers are 110.35 and 182.45. But those are per year, so over 20 years, they would be 20 times larger. So option C's numbers multiplied by 20 would be 2207 and 3649, which is option H.

Ah, that makes sense. So option C's numbers are annual, so when multiplied by 20, you get option H. So the total cost would be H: 2207 and 3649.

So the correct answer is H.

To compare the total cost of a $5,000 20-payment life insurance policy for a 25-year-old and a 45-year-old, we need to consider how life insurance premiums work. Generally, younger individuals pay lower premiums because the likelihood of death is lower, while older individuals pay higher premiums due to a higher mortality risk. The total cost is the sum of all premium payments over the 20-year term.

The question specifies that both individuals live for the term of the policy, meaning the insurance company does not pay out the death benefit. Therefore, the total cost for each individual is simply the sum of their premium payments over the 20 years. Since the 25-year-old has a lower annual premium than the 45-year-old, their total cost will also be lower.

Analyzing the options, we need to identify the one where the first number (25-year-old's total cost) is lower than the second number (45-year-old's total cost). After evaluating the options:

- **Option A**: $3649 (25) and $2207 (45) → Incorrect, as the 25-year-old's total is higher.
- **Option B**: $2207 (25) and $5000 (45) → Possible, as $2207 < $5000.
- **Option C**: $110.35 (25) and $182.45 (45) → These appear to be annual premiums, not total costs.
- **Option D**: $5000 (25) and $5000 (45) → Incorrect, as the totals are the same.
- **Option E**: $1500 (25) and $2500 (45) → Possible, as $1500 < $2500.
- **Option F**: $182.45 (25) and $110.35 (45) → Incorrect, as the 25-year-old's total is higher.
- **Option G**: $4250 (25) and $6250 (45) → Possible, as $4250 < $6250.
- **Option H**: $2207 (25) and $3649 (45) → Possible, as $2207 < $3649.
- **Option I**: $3649 (25) and $3649 (45) → Incorrect, as the totals are the same.
- **Option J**: $2500 (25) and $4500 (45) → Possible, as $2500 < $4500.

To determine the correct answer, we note that the numbers in **Option C** ($110.35 and $182.45) represent annual premiums. When multiplied by 20 (the term of the policy), these correspond to the totals in **Option H** ($2207 and $3649). This aligns with the reasoning that the 25-year-old pays less in total premiums than the 45-year-old.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**H: $2207 and $3649**

Answer: H
