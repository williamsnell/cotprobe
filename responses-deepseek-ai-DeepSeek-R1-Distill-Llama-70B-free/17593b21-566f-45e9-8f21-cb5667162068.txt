Okay, so I have this problem about dynamic similarity in a water tunnel study for a submarine-launched missile. Hmm, dynamic similarity... I remember that from my fluid mechanics class. It's about making sure the model behaves like the real thing, right? So, they're using a scale model, and I need to find the flow velocity in the tunnel.

The missile is 5 meters long and 1 meter in diameter. But wait, the model is 1/20th scale. So the model's length would be 5/20 which is 0.25 meters, and diameter 0.05 meters. But I'm not sure if I need the dimensions right now; maybe later.

The real missile's maximum speed is 10 m/s. The goal is to achieve dynamic similarity, so I think I need to match the Reynolds numbers between the model and the actual missile. Reynolds number is Re = velocity * length / kinematic viscosity. Oh wait, but wait, the fluids are different. The real missile is moving through water, and the model is also in water, so the viscosity is the same? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, no—wait, the model is in the same fluid as the prototype? Or is the model in a different fluid? No, wait, the problem says it's a water tunnel, so both the model and the prototype are in water. So the viscosity is the same for both.

Wait, but wait, no, no, wait. The full-scale missile is moving through seawater, but the model is in a water tunnel—probably the same water, so same viscosity. So their viscosities are the same. So for dynamic similarity, the Reynolds numbers must be equal.

So Re_model = Re_prototype.

Re is (V * L) / ν. Since ν is the same for both, we can equate (V_model * L_model) to (V_real * L_real).

Wait, but wait, the model is scaled down by 1/20. So L_model = L_real / 20. So substituting back:

V_model * (L_real / 20) = V_real * L_real.

Hmm, wait, that would mean V_model * (1/20) = V_real. So V_model = 20 * V_real.

Wait, that can't be right because that would make the model's velocity way higher than the options given. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, but wait, maybe I got the scaling wrong. The model is 1/20 scale, meaning L_model = (1/20) L_real. So if L_real is 5m, L_model is 0.25m, right.

So Re_model = V_model * L_model / ν.

Re_real = V_real * L_real / ν.

Setting them equal: V_model * L_model = V_real * L_real.

So V_model = (V_real * L_real) / L_model.

Since L_model = L_real / 20, substitute:

V_model = (V_real * L_real) / (L_real /20) ) = V_real * 20.

So V_model = 20 * V_real.

Given V_real is 10 m/s, so 20*10=200 m/s.

Wait, but that's option E:200 m/s. But looking at the options, that's one of them, E.

Wait, but that seems too high. I mean, 200 m/s is like supersonic speeds. Can a water tunnel achieve that? Hmm, maybe the problem is a bit theoretical, so perhaps it's correct.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should double-check. Because I might have miscalculated.

Alternative approach: The length scale is 1/20, so Lr = 1/20. So the velocity scale Vr would be (Lr) * (V_real) / (L_model) ?

Wait, no, wait, let me use the scaling laws properly. For Reynolds number similarity, since Re must be same, and ν is same, V * L must be same.

So V_model * L_model = V_real * L_real.

So V_model = V_real * (L_real / L_model) = V_real * (1 / (1/20)) ) = V_real * 20.

Yes, that's 20 times higher. So 10 m/s *20=200 m/s.

So the answer would be E:200 m/s.

But looking at the options, E is 200. So I think that's correct.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, when modeling, especially in different fluids, you might use something like Froude scaling or something else, but since it's water and water, Reynolds is the main parameter. So I think the approach is correct.

To achieve dynamic similarity in the water tunnel study, the Reynolds numbers of the model and the prototype must be equal. The Reynolds number is given by:

\[
\text{Re} = \frac{V \cdot L}{\nu}
\]

where \( V \) is the velocity, \( L \) is the characteristic length, and \( \nu \) is the kinematic viscosity. Since the model and the prototype are both in water, the kinematic viscosity \( \nu \) is the same for both. Therefore, the condition for dynamic similarity simplifies to:

\[
V_{\text{model}} \cdot L_{\text{model}} = V_{\text{prototype}} \cdot L_{\text{prototype}}
\]

The prototype missile has a length \( L_{\text{prototype}} = 5 \, \text{m} \), and the model is scaled down by a factor of \( \frac{1}{20} \), so:

\[
L_{\text{model}} = \frac{L_{\text{prototype}}}{20} = \frac{5}{20} = 0.25 \, \text{m}
\]

Substituting into the dynamic similarity equation:

\[
V_{\text{model}} = V_{\text{prototype}} \cdot \frac{L_{\text{prototype}}}{L_{\text{model}}}
\]

\[
V_{\text{model}} = 10 \cdot \frac{5}{0.25} = 10 \cdot 20 = 200 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Thus, the mean water tunnel flow velocity required to achieve dynamic similarity is \( 200 \, \text{m/s} \).

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**E: 200 m/s**
