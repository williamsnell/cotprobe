Okay, so I've got this question about psychological studies on aggression and what they imply about television programming. Hmm, I remember that there's been a lot of research on whether watching TV, especially violent content, affects people's behavior. Let me think through this.

The question is asking what most psychological studies suggest. From what I recall, a significant amount of research indicates that exposure to violent television can increase aggressive thoughts and behaviors. I think this is often referred to as the "media violence" effect. Studies like the Bobo doll experiment by Bandura showed that kids who watched someone being aggressive towards a doll were more likely to imitate that behavior. So that's supporting the idea that TV can influence aggression.

Looking at the options, option D says "Violent television increases aggression." That seems to align with what I remember about the studies concluding. But wait, let me go through each option to make sure I'm not missing something.

Option A says TV is the sole cause of aggression. That doesn't sound right because aggression is influenced by many factors like environment, genetics, and upbringing. So TV can't be the sole cause. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B suggests that aggression on TV promotes positive conflict resolution. That doesn't make sense. If anything, violent TV might show aggressive ways to solve problems, which isn't positive. So B is likely wrong.

Option C claims prosocial messages increase aggression. But prosocial content is meant to show positive behaviors like helping, so that should decrease aggression, not increase. So C doesn't make sense.

Option D again, violent TV increases aggression. That fits with the research I remember. Let's keep that in mind.

Option E states TV increases passive behavior. I think some shows might make people less active, but I'm not sure that's about aggression. Also, the question is about psychological studies on aggression, so E might not be the right fit here.

Option F says non-violent TV increases aggression. That seems counterintuitive. If the content isn't violent, why would it increase aggression? Unless it's something else, but I don't think studies show that. So probably not F.

Option G: TV reflects society but doesn't affect it. That sounds more like a sociological viewpoint. I'm not sure psychological studies would say that. Psychological studies often look at individual effects, so G might not be the answer.

Option H says TV reduces aggression. That seems opposite of what I've learned, unless it's about calming content, but the question is general about programming, which includes various types. So H is unlikely.

Option I claims TV has no effect. I think that's not the case, as there's evidence showing some effect, even if it's not the only factor. So I is probably incorrect.

Option J says the effects are unknown. But the question states "what do the results imply," so if most studies point in a direction, then J isn't the right choice.

Putting it all together, the studies mostly support that violent TV increases aggression. So the answer should be D.

The results of most psychological studies on aggression suggest that exposure to violent television programming can increase aggressive thoughts and behaviors in viewers. This conclusion is supported by research such as the Bobo doll experiment, which demonstrated that observing aggressive behavior on television can lead to imitation and increased aggression. Among the given options, the one that aligns with these findings is:

D: Violent television increases aggression.

Other options are inconsistent with the research. For example, television is not the sole cause of aggression (A), nor does it promote positive conflict resolution (B). Prosocial content is meant to reduce aggression (C), and non-violent television does not increase aggression (F). Additionally, television is not known to reduce aggression (H), have no effect on it (I), or have unknown effects (J). While television may reflect societal trends (G), psychological studies focus on its impact on individual behavior, making D the most accurate choice.

Answer: D
