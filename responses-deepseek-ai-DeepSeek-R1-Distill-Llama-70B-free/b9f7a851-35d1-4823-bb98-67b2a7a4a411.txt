Okay, so I've got this problem about minimizing the cost of a cylindrical container. The volume is fixed at 10 cubic feet, and I need to find the dimensions that give the lowest cost. Hmm, let me think.

Alright, the cylinder has a top, bottom, and a side. The top and bottom are made of a material that costs $2 per square foot, and the side costs $1.50 per square foot. So, the total cost will depend on the areas of these parts.

First, I should write down the formulas involved. The volume of a cylinder is V = πr²h. Since the volume is fixed at 10, that equation will relate r and h.

Now, the cost. The top and bottom are circles, so their area is each πr². Together, that's 2πr². The side is the lateral surface area, which is 2πrh. So the total cost C would be the cost per area multiplied by their respective areas.

So the cost function C is: C = (2 * πr²) * 2 + (2πrh) * 1.5.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the top and bottom each cost $2 per sq ft, so their total cost is 2*(πr²)*2? No, wait, wait. No, wait no, the area is πr² for each, so two of them is 2πr². Then multiplied by the cost per sq ft, which is $2. So that's 2πr² * 2 = 4πr².

The side is 2πrh, and each sq ft costs $1.50, so that's 2πrh * 1.50 = 3πrh.

So the total cost C = 4πr² + 3πrh.

And the volume constraint is πr²h = 10. So from that, I can express h in terms of r. Let's solve for h: h = 10/(πr²). 

Now, substitute h into the cost function to get C in terms of r only. So,

C(r) = 4πr² + 3πr*(10/(πr²)).

Simplify that. Let's see: 3πr*(10)/(πr²) is (30 r) / r²) because π cancels. So 30/r.

So C(r) = 4πr² + 30/r.

Now, to find the minimum cost, I need to take the derivative of C with respect to r, set it to zero, and solve for r.

Let's compute dC/dr. 

dC/dr = derivative of 4πr² is 8πr. The derivative of 30/r is -30/(r²).

So, 8πr - 30/(r²) = 0.

Set this equal to zero: 8πr = 30/(r²).

Multiply both sides by r²: 8πr³ = 30.

Divide both sides by 8π: r³ = 30/(8π) = (15)/(4π).

So r = cube root of (15/(4π)).

Let me compute that numerically. 15/(4π) is approximately 15/(12.566) ≈ 1.193. So cube root of 1.193 is about 1.06 feet. Let me check that.

Wait, 1.06^3 is about 1.06 *1.06=1.1236, *1.06 again is around 1.19, which matches. So r ≈1.061 feet.

Now, compute h using h=10/(πr²). Let's plug r=1.061 in.

r² is (1.061)^2 ≈1.126. So π*1.126 ≈3.534. Then 10 / 3.534 ≈2.828 feet.

So the dimensions are approximately r=1.061 ft and h=2.828 ft. Now, looking at the options, option A is exactly these numbers. So the answer should be A.

To minimize the total cost of the cylindrical container, we start by defining the cost function and the volume constraint. The volume of the cylinder is given by:

\[
V = \pi r^2 h = 10 \, \text{cubic feet}.
\]

The total cost \( C \) depends on the areas of the top, bottom, and side of the cylinder. The top and bottom are made of material costing $2 per square foot, and the side is made of material costing $1.50 per square foot. The total cost is:

\[
C = 2 \cdot (\pi r^2) \cdot 2 + (2 \pi r h) \cdot 1.5 = 4 \pi r^2 + 3 \pi r h.
\]

Using the volume constraint, we express \( h \) in terms of \( r \):

\[
h = \frac{10}{\pi r^2}.
\]

Substituting \( h \) into the cost function gives:

\[
C(r) = 4 \pi r^2 + \frac{30}{r}.
\]

To find the minimum cost, we take the derivative of \( C(r) \) with respect to \( r \), set it to zero, and solve for \( r \):

\[
\frac{dC}{dr} = 8 \pi r - \frac{30}{r^2} = 0.
\]

Solving \( 8 \pi r = \frac{30}{r^2} \), we get:

\[
r^3 = \frac{30}{8 \pi} = \frac{15}{4 \pi}.
\]

Numerically, \( \frac{15}{4 \pi} \approx 1.193 \), so:

\[
r \approx \sqrt[3]{1.193} \approx 1.061 \, \text{feet}.
\]

Using \( h = \frac{10}{\pi r^2} \), we calculate \( h \):

\[
r^2 \approx (1.061)^2 \approx 1.126, \quad \pi r^2 \approx 3.534, \quad h \approx \frac{10}{3.534} \approx 2.828 \, \text{feet}.
\]

Thus, the dimensions that minimize the cost are approximately \( r = 1.061 \, \text{feet} \) and \( h = 2.828 \, \text{feet} \). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**A: \( r = 1.061 \, \text{feet}, h = 2.828 \, \text{feet} \).**
