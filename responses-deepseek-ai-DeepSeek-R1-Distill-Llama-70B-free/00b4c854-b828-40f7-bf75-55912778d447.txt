Question:

After weeks of deliberation, a boyfriend decided to embark on his plan to rob a bank. As part of his scheme, the boyfriend enlisted his girlfriend, who agreed to drive the getaway car. On the day of the robbery, the girlfriend and the boyfriend drove to the bank. After the girlfriend parked outside and the boyfriend went into the bank, she saw a security guard in the bank and changed her mind and fled on foot, leaving the keys in the car with the motor running. A few minutes later, the boyfriend went into the bank, robbed it, and then ran back to the car. He drove off and was speeding away from the bank when he looked behind to see if he was being followed. As he took his eye off the road, the boyfriend's vehicle struck a pedestrian who was crossing the street, killing her. For the pedestrian's death, the girlfriend should be found guilty of which, if any, of the following crimes?

Options:

A: Murder.
B: No crime.
C: Involuntary manslaughter.
D: Negligent homicide.
E: Conspiracy to commit murder.
F: Attempted murder.
G: Second degree murder.
H: Accessory after the fact.
I: Voluntary manslaughter.

Okay, so I have this legal question here about criminal liability, and I need to figure it out. Let's see, the scenario is about a boyfriend and girlfriend involved in a bank robbery. The girlfriend was supposed to be the getaway driver but changed her mind and fled, leaving the car. The boyfriend then robbed the bank, took the car, and while speeding away, he hit and killed a pedestrian. The question is asking what crime, if any, the girlfriend is guilty of regarding the pedestrian's death.

Alright, let me break this down. First, I need to understand the roles each played and the legal principles involved. The girlfriend agreed to drive the getaway car, so they were in a conspiracy to commit robbery. But then she got cold feet, saw the security guard, and left. So she withdrew from the plan before the robbery happened. Wait, but when did she withdraw? She drove to the bank, parked, let the boyfriend go in, then she saw the guard and fled. So the robbery hadn't happened yet when she left. Does that mean she effectively withdrew from the conspiracy?

In criminal law, for conspiracy, if a person withdraws before the crime is committed, they might not be liable for the subsequent crimes committed by their co-conspirators. But if the withdrawal is after the crime has started or if the crime is a continuing one, it might be different. Here, she withdrew before the boyfriend actually robbed the bank, so maybe she's not liable for the robbery itself.

But the question is about the pedestrian's death, which happened when the boyfriend was fleeing after the robbery. So the girlfriend isn't present when he was driving. She left the car with the keys, so he took it and drove off, causing the accident.

Now, what's the liability here? The pedestrian died because the boyfriend was speeding and hit her. So the immediate cause is his action. But the question is whether the girlfriend bears any responsibility.

I remember that in criminal law, especially regarding felony murder, if a death occurs during the commission of a felony, all participants can be held liable. But wait, felony murder usually applies to deaths that happen during the felony, and all participants in the felony can be held responsible, even if the killing was accidental or done by someone else, like a co-felon, a victim, or a bystander.

But wait, in this case, the girlfriend withdrew before the robbery took place. So she wasn't part of the robbery when it actually happened. So would she still be considered a participant in the felony for felony murder purposes? Probably not. Because she withdrew before the felony began. So she's not part of that.

Another angle is aiding and abetting. If she provided assistance or encouragement before the crime, could she be liable? But she withdrew, so maybe that breaks the chain.

Alternatively, could she be guilty of involuntary manslaughter? Involuntary manslaughter is the unlawful killing without malice, often due to recklessness or criminal negligence. But for that, she would have to have some direct involvement in the act that caused the death. She left the car, but the boyfriend's driving caused the death. So did her leaving the car contribute to the death?

Wait, she left the keys in the car, so the boyfriend could take it. If she had taken the keys, he might not have had a getaway car, but she didn't. So her action of leaving the keys might have enabled him to drive away, leading to the accident. But is that enough to make her responsible?

I think the key here is whether her actions were a proximate cause of the death. She didn't force him to drive recklessly; she just made the car available. The boyfriend's decision to speed and take his eyes off the road was his own action. So her leaving the car might not be the direct cause of the pedestrian's death.

But maybe under some theory of criminal liability, like vicarious liability, but I don't think that applies here. Vicarious liability is more for things like employers for their employees' actions, or parents for minors, which isn't the case here.

Another thought: conspiracy. She was part of a conspiracy to commit robbery. But the robbery was completed, and then the death happened during the getaway. So if the getaway is considered part of the same felony, then maybe she's still on the hook for felony murder. But wait, she withdrew before the robbery occurred, so she wasn't part of the conspiracy when the robbery happened. Therefore, she wouldn't be liable for any deaths that occurred during the commission of the robbery or the getaway.

Alternatively, could she be an accessory after the fact? Accessory after the fact is someone who helps a felon escape after the crime. But she didn't help him after the fact; she left before the crime was committed. So that doesn't apply either.

So, considering all this, I think the girlfriend isn't guilty of murder, felony murder, or manslaughter because she withdrew before the crime, and her actions didn't directly cause the death. Therefore, the answer might be that she isn't guilty of any crime related to the pedestrian's death.

Wait, but let me double-check. She left the car with the keys, which he used to flee. Could that be seen as aiding and abetting his escape, making her responsible for the death? Or perhaps as a form of recklessness?

Involuntary manslaughter requires that the defendant's actions were criminally negligent and caused the death. She left the car, which he used. But his driving was the direct cause. So was her leaving the car a breach of duty? Maybe. But I'm not sure if that's sufficient for involuntary manslaughter. It seems a stretch because the chain of events is a bit too attenuated.

I think the correct answer is that she's not guilty of any crime related to the pedestrian's death, so the answer would be option B: No crime.

The scenario involves a girlfriend who initially agreed to drive the getaway car for her boyfriend's bank robbery but withdrew before the robbery occurred. She left the car with the keys, enabling the boyfriend to flee after the robbery. During his escape, the boyfriend struck and killed a pedestrian. The question is whether the girlfriend bears criminal liability for the pedestrian's death.

1. **Conspiracy and Withdrawal**: The girlfriend was part of a conspiracy to commit robbery. However, she withdrew before the robbery took place. Under criminal law, withdrawal from a conspiracy before the commission of the crime generally absolves the withdrawing party of liability for crimes committed by co-conspirators afterward.

2. **Felony Murder**: Felony murder applies when a death occurs during the commission of a felony, and all participants in the felony can be held liable. However, since the girlfriend withdrew before the robbery, she was not a participant in the felony at the time of the robbery or the subsequent getaway. Thus, she cannot be held liable under felony murder.

3. **Involuntary Manslaughter**: Involuntary manslaughter involves unlawful killing without malice, often due to recklessness or criminal negligence. While the girlfriend left the car with the keys, enabling the boyfriend to flee, her actions do not constitute a direct or proximate cause of the pedestrian's death. The boyfriend's reckless driving was the immediate cause, and the girlfriend's role is too attenuated to establish liability for involuntary manslaughter.

4. **Accessory After the Fact**: Accessory after the fact involves assisting a felon after the crime. The girlfriend did not aid the boyfriend after the robbery; she withdrew before the crime occurred. Therefore, this does not apply.

5. **Aiding and Abetting**: While the girlfriend initially agreed to drive the getaway car, her withdrawal before the robbery means she did not aid or encourage the commission of the crime at the time it occurred.

In conclusion, the girlfriend's withdrawal before the robbery and the lack of a direct causal link between her actions and the pedestrian's death mean she is not guilty of any crime related to the pedestrian's death.
