Question:

What are some advantages of doing genetics in bacteria and yeastinstead of in larger organisms (i.e.,multicellular eukaryotes)?

Options:

A: Bacteria and yeast are more complex organisms.
B: Bacteria and yeast have longer life cycles, allowing for extended study over time.
C: Bacteria and yeast can perform more complex behaviors than multicellular organisms, which makes them better for study.
D: Bacteria and yeast have larger genomes, providing more genetic material to work with.
E: Bacteria and yeast are less susceptible to genetic diseases, making them more stable for experimentation.
F: Bacteria and yeast have a slower rate of mutation.
G: Bacteria and yeast do not require ethical considerations when used in experiments.
H: Bacteria and yeast grow quickly, inexpensively, in a small space and have a high probability of mutation. Prokaryotes are haploid, making single inactivation more likely. Yeast are eukaryotic, closely related to multicellular animals and plants, and can be grown in either the haploid or diploid state.
I: Bacteria and yeast have a lower rate of genetic recombination, making genetic mapping simpler.
J: Bacteria and yeast are easier to maintain in a lab.

Okay, so I've got this question about genetics, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about the advantages of doing genetics in bacteria and yeast instead of larger, multicellular eukaryotes. Hmm. I remember that model organisms are chosen for certain practical reasons. Bacteria and yeast are pretty common in labs, right?

So, what are the advantages? Well, bacteria are prokaryotes, and yeast are eukaryotes, but both are unicellular. That probably makes them easier to handle. Let me think about each option.

Option A: Bacteria and yeast are more complex. That doesn't make sense. Larger eukaryotes are more complex, so I think A is wrong.

Option B: They have longer life cycles. Wait, I thought bacteria and yeast have shorter life cycles, which allows for quicker experiments. So B is probably incorrect.

Option C: They can perform more complex behaviors. No, I don't think so. Multicellular organisms can do more complex things, so C is likely wrong.

Option D: Larger genomes. I don't think bacteria have larger genomes than, say, humans. Humans have way more genes. So D is probably wrong.

Option E: Less susceptible to genetic diseases. Hmm. Bacteria might not get genetic diseases the way humans do, but I'm not sure if that's a main reason for using them. Maybe, but not the primary advantage.

Option F: Slower mutation rate. Wait, bacteria have higher mutation rates because they reproduce so quickly. Or wait, maybe they have a high probability of mutation? I'm a bit confused here. I'll have to think more on this.

Option G: No ethical considerations. Oh right, using bacteria and yeast doesn't raise ethical issues like using animals or humans. But is that the main reason for using them in genetics? Maybe a benefit, but not the key advantage.

Option H: They grow quickly, are inexpensive, small space, high mutation probability. Prokaryotes are haploid, so gene inactivation is easier. Yeast are eukaryotes, related to animals and plants, can be haploid or diploid. This sounds familiar. I remember that bacteria grow rapidly and are cheap to maintain, which makes them ideal for large-scale genetic studies. Yeast being eukaryotes makes them a good model for studying eukaryotic genetics. Plus, haploid state means each gene is present in a single copy, simplifying genetic analysis. So H seems like a strong candidate.

Option I: Lower rate of genetic recombination. I'm not sure. Yeast can undergo recombination, especially during meiosis if they're haploid. But I'm not certain if lower recombination makes mapping easier. Maybe in bacteria, since they don't do meiosis, but I think recombination in bacteria is via transformation or conjugation, which is less frequent. So maybe I is a point, but I don't know if it's the main advantage.

Option J: Easier to maintain in lab. Yes, that's true. They require less space and resources. So J is also a correct point, but is it the most comprehensive answer?

Looking back at the options, the question asks for "some advantages", so the best answer might be the one that lists multiple key points.

Option H mentions several things: quick growth, inexpensive, small space, high mutation rate. Also, prokaryotes being haploid (so easy to see mutations), and yeast's relation to eukaryotes and their ability to be grown haploid or diploid. That covers several advantages.

Option J is also correct, but it's just one point. The question is looking for "some advantages", so an option that includes multiple would be better.

Wait, let me think about the mutation rate. High mutation probability would be good for screening for mutants, right? Because you can get a lot of genetic variation quickly. So that's a plus.

So putting it all together, option H covers several important advantages: rapid growth, low cost, small space, high mutation rates, haploid state (making genetic analysis easier), and the relevance of yeast to eukaryotic organisms. That makes H the correct answer.

The question asks about the advantages of using bacteria and yeast in genetic studies compared to larger multicellular eukaryotes. To determine the correct answer, each option was analyzed:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Bacteria and yeast are simpler organisms, not more complex than multicellular eukaryotes.  
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Bacteria and yeast have shorter life cycles, which is advantageous for rapid experimentation.  
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Multicellular organisms can perform more complex behaviors than unicellular organisms like bacteria and yeast.  
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Bacteria have smaller genomes, not larger ones, compared to multicellular eukaryotes.  
- **Option E**: While partially true, this is not a primary advantage for using bacteria and yeast in genetics.  
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Bacteria have a higher mutation rate due to their rapid reproduction, which is beneficial for genetic studies.  
- **Option G**: True but not the main advantage. Ethical considerations are less relevant for bacteria and yeast, but this is not the primary reason for their use.  
- **Option H**: Correct. This option lists multiple key advantages: rapid growth, low cost, small space requirements, high mutation rates, and the simplicity of genetic analysis in haploid organisms. Additionally, yeast is a eukaryote closely related to multicellular animals and plants, making it a valuable model organism.  
- **Option I**: While bacteria have less frequent recombination, this is not the main advantage of using them.  
- **Option J**: Partially true but less comprehensive. While bacteria and yeast are easier to maintain, this does not encompass all the key advantages.

Option **H** is the most comprehensive and accurate answer, as it covers multiple significant advantages of using bacteria and yeast in genetic studies.  

Answer: H
