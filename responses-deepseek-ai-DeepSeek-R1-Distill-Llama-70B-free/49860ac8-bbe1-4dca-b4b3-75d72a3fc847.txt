Question:

A defendant suspected her long-term boyfriend was cheating on her. On a hunch, she went to her boyfriend's apartment one afternoon and, using her key, she entered the apartment. Once inside, she found her boyfriend and his new girlfriend in bed together. In a rage, the defendant retrieved the gun from the nightstand and killed her boyfriend and his new girlfriend. After the shooting, the defendant left on a two-day trip to the mountains to get the week's events off her mind. She called her teenage neighbor to take care of her apartment while she was gone and to look after her 4-year-old daughter. That night, after the defendant left, the police came to the apartment. They asked the neighbor if they could search the apartment, and the neighbor gave them permission. The police found in the defendant's bedroom the gun used to kill her boyfriend. At a motion to suppress the gun prior to trial, which of the following facts would the defendant's attorney be LEAST likely to attempt to prove?

Options:

A: The neighbor did not have the authority to give permission to search the apartment.
B: The police did not read the neighbor her rights before asking for consent to search.
C: The defendant's daughter was not present at the time of the search.
D: The defendant did not own the gun used to kill her boyfriend.
E: The police told the neighbor she would be taken to the police station if she refused permission to search.
F: The gun was not visible without a thorough search of the defendant's bedroom.
G: The defendant gave her neighbor the keys to her apartment.
H: The defendant told her neighbor not to answer the door to anyone.
I: The defendant had an alibi for the time of the murder.
J: The police did not have a search warrant.

Okay, so I've got this law question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it carefully.

The scenario is about a defendant who killed her boyfriend and his new girlfriend after catching them in bed. She left for a trip and asked her teenage neighbor to take care of her apartment and daughter. The police came, asked the neighbor for permission to search, and the neighbor agreed. They found the gun in the defendant's bedroom. Now, the defendant is moving to suppress the gun as evidence, and the question is about which fact her attorney would be least likely to try to prove.

The question is multiple-choice, with options A through J. I need to determine which fact is least relevant or useful for the defense attorney to prove in trying to suppress the evidence.

Let me think about the legal concepts involved here. This seems to revolve around the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. Consent to a search is a big issue here because if the police obtain voluntary consent from someone with authority to give it, the search is generally valid without a warrant.

So, the defendant's attorney would likely argue that the search was unconstitutional, trying to show that the consent was invalid. To do that, they might challenge whether the neighbor had the authority to consent, whether the consent was voluntary, and whether the police acted properly.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The neighbor didn't have authority to give permission. That's a key point. If the neighbor wasn't authorized, the consent is invalid. The defense would probably bring this up.

Option B: Police didn't read the neighbor her rights. Hmm, I don't think Miranda rights apply here. Miranda is about custodial interrogation, not about consent to search. So this might not be relevant. The attorney might not focus on this.

Option C: The defendant's daughter wasn't present. Not sure how that affects consent. Maybe if the daughter was the one with authority, but the neighbor was the one giving consent. I don't see the immediate relevance.

Option D: Defendant didn't own the gun. That's about the gun's ownership. But the issue is the search, not whether the gun was hers. If it's found in her apartment, ownership might not matter. Unless it's about standingâ€”whether she has standing to challenge the search. But if she lives there, she does have standing, regardless of the gun's ownership.

Option E: Police threatened the neighbor if she refused. This would make the consent involuntary. If the police coerced her, the consent isn't valid. So the defense would want to prove this.

Option F: Gun wasn't visible without a thorough search. This relates to the scope of the consent. If the neighbor allowed a search, but the gun was hidden, maybe the police exceeded the scope. So this could be relevant.

Option G: Defendant gave neighbor keys. This shows the neighbor had authority, which would support the consent. Wait, but the defense would argue the opposite. So if the attorney wants to question the neighbor's authority, they would maybe say the neighbor didn't have keys. But if the defendant did give keys, that supports the neighbor's authority. So the defense would not want to prove this; they might argue against it. But the question is what the attorney would be least likely to attempt to prove. So this might not be a point they'd focus on because it goes against their case.

Option H: Defendant told neighbor not to answer the door. This suggests that the neighbor was instructed not to let people in, which would undermine the neighbor's authority to consent. So the defense would probably bring this up.

Option I: Defendant had an alibi. That's about guilt or innocence, not about the admissibility of evidence. The motion to suppress is about the legality of the search, not about whether she committed the crime. So this fact wouldn't be relevant in a suppression hearing. The attorney wouldn't try to prove this here.

Option J: Police didn't have a warrant. That's a common argument in suppression. The defense would argue that without a warrant, the search was invalid unless an exception applies, like consent. So they'd definitely bring this up.

Now, the question is which fact the attorney would be least likely to attempt to prove. So, looking for the option that is irrelevant or counterproductive.

Option B: Police didn't read Miranda rights. As I thought earlier, Miranda doesn't apply here because consent isn't related to interrogation. So the attorney wouldn't care about this.

Option I: Alibi. Not relevant to the search's legality.

So between B and I. Which one is less likely?

The question is about the motion to suppress, which is about the search's legality. So the alibi (Option I) is about the defendant's guilt, not the search. The attorney wouldn't bring that up in this motion. So Option I is something the attorney wouldn't attempt to prove here.

Alternatively, Option B's Miranda issue is also irrelevant because it's about the search, not about statements. So the attorney wouldn't argue that either.

But which is less likely. The question is phrased as which would the attorney be least likely to attempt to prove.

Wait, in a motion to suppress evidence, the defendant's alibi (Option I) is irrelevant. The focus is on the search, not on her guilt. So the attorney wouldn't present evidence about the alibi in this context.

Similarly, Miranda rights (Option B) are irrelevant because they deal with interrogation, not searches.

So which is the least likely? The options are about what the attorney would attempt to prove in the motion. The alibi is not about the search, so the attorney wouldn't bring it up. So Option I would be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. The options are what the attorney would be least likely to attempt to prove. So the question is about which fact is not useful for the motion to suppress.

So the attorney's goal is to show the search was illegal. So any fact that doesn't relate to the legality of the search wouldn't be relevant.

Option I: Defendant had an alibi. That's about whether she committed the crime, not about the search. So in a suppression hearing, this fact is irrelevant. So the attorney wouldn't attempt to prove this.

Similarly, Option B is about Miranda, which isn't relevant to the search. So the attorney wouldn't bring that up either.

But which is less likely. Which of these is the correct answer.

Wait, the question is about which fact the attorney would be least likely to attempt to prove. So the least relevant fact to the suppression motion.

Option I is about the defendant's alibi, which is unrelated to the search's legality. So the attorney wouldn't bring this up. So the correct answer is I.

But wait, looking back at the options, Option I says "The defendant had an alibi for the time of the murder." This is about her innocence, not the search. The motion to suppress is about the evidence's admissibility, not her guilt. So the attorney would not try to prove this.

In contrast, Option B is about Miranda, which is a different constitutional right but unrelated to the search. So the attorney wouldn't bring that up in the suppression motion either.

But which is the least likely. In the context of a suppression motion, alibi is completely irrelevant, so the attorney would not attempt to prove that. So the answer is I.

The question revolves around a motion to suppress evidence obtained through a search, focusing on the legality of the search under the Fourth Amendment. The defendant's attorney would aim to challenge the validity of the consent given by the neighbor and the circumstances surrounding the search. The key is to identify which fact is least relevant or useful for the attorney to prove in this context.

- **Option A**: The neighbor's authority to consent is directly relevant, as the validity of the search depends on whether the neighbor had the right to give permission. The attorney would likely focus on this.
- **Option B**: The police not reading Miranda rights is irrelevant because Miranda applies to custodial interrogation, not consent to search. This would not be a focus for the attorney.
- **Option C**: The absence of the defendant's daughter is not directly relevant to the legality of the search or the neighbor's authority to consent.
- **Option D**: Whether the defendant owned the gun is less relevant to the search's legality and more about the gun's connection to the crime.
- **Option E**: If the police coerced the neighbor, this would render the consent involuntary, making this a relevant point for the attorney.
- **Option F**: The gun's visibility relates to the scope of the search and whether the police exceeded the consent given, so this could be relevant.
- **Option G**: The defendant giving the neighbor keys supports the neighbor's authority to consent, which the attorney would likely challenge, not prove.
- **Option H**: Instructions not to answer the door could undermine the neighbor's authority to consent, making this relevant for the attorney.
- **Option I**: The defendant's alibi pertains to her guilt or innocence, not the legality of the search, making it irrelevant in this context.
- **Option J**: The absence of a warrant is a common argument in suppression motions, as the search must fall under an exception like consent.

The least relevant fact is **Option I**, as the defendant's alibi is unrelated to the legality of the search and would not be addressed in a motion to suppress. The attorney would not attempt to prove this in this context.

**Answer: I**
