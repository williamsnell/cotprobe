Okay, so I need to figure out which of Erikson's stages corresponds to Freud's phallic stage. Hmm, I remember that both Erikson and Freud had theories about psychological development, but they structured them differently.

Freud's psychosexual stages include the phallic stage. I think that's around the third stage where the focus is on the genitals, and it's associated with the Oedipus complex. The age for this is probably around 3-6 years old, maybe.

Now, Erikson's theory is about psychosocial development, with eight stages. Each has a crisis or conflict. Let me try to remember the order. The first is trust vs mistrust in infancy, then autonomy vs shame and doubt during toddler years. Then initiative vs guilt, which I think is next. So maybe that's around the same time as Freud's phallic stage.

Wait, so Initiative vs Guilt is the third stage. So that would be around early school age, maybe 4-6 years. That fits with the phallic stage's age range.

So the question is asking which of the options matches. Looking at the options:

Option G is Initiative vs. Guilt. So the answer should be G.

Wait, let me double-check. Freud's stages are oral, anal, phallic, latency, genital. Phallic is third. Erikson's third stage is initiative vs guilt. Yeah, that makes sense. So the correct answer is G.

The correct answer is G, as Erikson's "initiative vs. guilt" stage corresponds to Freud's phallic stage in terms of age and developmental focus.

Answer: G
