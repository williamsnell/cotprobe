Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about the final temperature of a sample of argon after it undergoes a reversible and adiabatic expansion. The given data is a bit specific, so I need to make sure I don't miss anything. Let's list out what's given:

- Mass of argon: 12.0 grams. Hmm, I remember that argon is a noble gas, atomic number 18, so its molar mass should be around 40 g/mol. Because 12 grams divided by 40 g/mol would give me the number of moles. Let me calculate that: 12 / 40 = 0.3 moles. Okay, that's useful.

- Initial volume is 1.0 dm³, which I think is the same as 1 liter, and since 1 m³ is 1000 liters, 1 dm³ is 0.001 m³. The expansion is to 3.0 dm³, so the volume triples. So V1 = 1.0 dm³, V2 = 3.0 dm³.

- The initial temperature is 273.15 K, which is 0 degrees Celsius. That's a standard temperature, so I'll need that for calculations.

Since the process is adiabatic and reversible, I remember that for such processes, the relation between temperature and volume (or temperature and pressure) is given by the adiabatic equations. I think the formula is T1 * V1^(γ-1) = T2 * V2^(γ-1), where γ is the heat capacity ratio, Cp/Cv. So I need to find γ for argon.

Wait, argon is a monatomic gas, right? Monatomic gases have different heat capacities. For monatomic ideal gases, the molar heat capacities are Cv = (3/2)R and Cp = (5/2)R. So γ is Cp/Cv = (5/2 R) / (3/2 R) = 5/3 ≈ 1.6667. So γ is 5/3 for argon.

So the formula I can use is T1 * (V1 / V2)^(γ-1) = T2. Wait, no, let me think again. The correct formula for an adiabatic process is T1 * V1^(γ-1) = T2 * V2^(γ-1). So rearranging for T2, it's T2 = T1 * (V1 / V2)^(γ-1).

Plugging in the numbers, T1 is 273.15 K, V1 is 1.0 dm³, V2 is 3.0 dm³, and γ is 5/3. So let's compute the exponent first: γ-1 is 5/3 - 1 = 2/3.

So the ratio V1/V2 is (1.0)/(3.0) = 1/3. Then (1/3) raised to the power of 2/3. Hmm, exponents can be tricky. Let me see. (1/3)^(2/3) is the same as (3^(-1))^(2/3) = 3^(-2/3). Alternatively, 3^(2/3) is cube root of 3 squared. Wait, but since it's to the -2/3, it's 1/(3^(2/3)).

Let me compute 3^(1/3) first. Cube root of 3 is approximately 1.4422. So 3^(2/3) is (3^(1/3))^2 = 1.4422^2 ≈ 2.0801. So 3^(-2/3) is 1/2.0801 ≈ 0.4807.

So the exponent part is 0.4807. Then T2 = 273.15 K * 0.4807. Let me compute that: 273.15 * 0.4807 ≈ ?

Calculating 273 * 0.48 is about 131.04, but wait, 0.4807 is a little over 0.48, so maybe around 131.5. Let me get more precise.

0.4807 * 273.15 = ?

Breaking it down: 273.15 * 0.4 = 109.26, 273.15 * 0.08 = 21.852, 273.15 * 0.0007 = approx 0.1912. So adding those: 109.26 +21.852 = 131.112, plus 0.1912 is about 131.303 K.

Wait, but wait a second. I feel like I might have messed up the exponent part. Because I've been a bit shaky on the formula.

Alternatively, let me think of the formula again. The relation is T1 * (V1/V2)^(γ-1) = T2. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. For an adiabatic expansion, since the gas is doing work on the surroundings (because volume increases), the temperature should drop, which makes sense because our calculation went from 273 K to around 131 K, which is a drop.

But let me check the options given. The options are A:162, B:151, C:120, D:145, E:210, F:172, G:189, H:131, I:200, J:158.

So according to my calculation, it's around 131 K, which matches option H.

Wait, but wait. Did I make any mistake in the calculations? Because 131 is one of the options. But wait, let me double-check the exponent.

So (V1/V2) is 1/3. (1/3)^(2/3) = e^( (2/3) ln(1/3) ) = e^( (2/3)*(-ln3) ). Ln3 is about 1.0986, so (2/3)(-1.0986) = -0.7324. e^-0.7324 is approximately 0.4807, which is correct.

So 273.15 * 0.4807 ≈ 131.3 K. So option H is 131 K, which is very close. So that's the answer.

But another thought: wait, sometimes in thermodynamics, especially for real gases, other factors come into play, but the question says to assume all gases are perfect, so that's fine. Also, the number of moles is 0.3, but in this formula, the number of moles cancels out because it's a per mole basis. So our calculation doesn't need the moles as everything is proportionally handled in the formula.

Alternatively, another approach: using the relation (T2/T1) = (V1/V2)^(γ-1).

So (T2) = T1 * (1/3)^(2/3) as before. So yes, same result.

So I'm confident the answer is H: 131 K.

To calculate the final temperature of the argon gas after a reversible and adiabatic expansion, we use the adiabatic relation:

\[
T_1 \cdot V_1^{\gamma - 1} = T_2 \cdot V_2^{\gamma - 1}
\]

Rearranging for \(T_2\):

\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot \left(\frac{V_1}{V_2}\right)^{\gamma - 1}
\]

### Given Data:
- Initial temperature: \(T_1 = 273.15 \, \mathrm{K}\)
- Initial volume: \(V_1 = 1.0 \, \mathrm{dm}^3\)
- Final volume: \(V_2 = 3.0 \, \mathrm{dm}^3\)
- Argon is a monatomic gas, so \(\gamma = \frac{5}{3}\).

### Step 1: Calculate \(\gamma - 1\)
\[
\gamma - 1 = \frac{5}{3} - 1 = \frac{2}{3}
\]

### Step 2: Compute the volume ratio
\[
\frac{V_1}{V_2} = \frac{1.0}{3.0} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

### Step 3: Raise the volume ratio to the power of \(\gamma - 1\)
\[
\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{\frac{2}{3}} = 3^{-\frac{2}{3}} = \frac{1}{3^{\frac{2}{3}}}
\]
The cube root of 3 is approximately \(1.4422\), so:
\[
3^{\frac{2}{3}} = (1.4422)^2 \approx 2.0801
\]
Thus:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{\frac{2}{3}} \approx \frac{1}{2.0801} \approx 0.4807
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \(T_2\)
\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot \left(\frac{V_1}{V_2}\right)^{\gamma - 1} = 273.15 \cdot 0.4807 \approx 131.3 \, \mathrm{K}
\]

### Final Answer:
The final temperature of the argon gas is approximately \(131 \, \mathrm{K}\), which corresponds to option **H**.
