Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this psychology question. Let's read it carefully.

The scenario is about a man who witnessed a horrific event: his wife and children were killed by a speeding truck while crossing the street. But here's the thingâ€”he has no memory of the event and gets upset when people tell him he must remember. The question is asking what disorder he's most likely suffering from.

Hmm, I remember that there are several memory-related disorders in psychology. Let's think about the options given.

The options are A through J, each a different disorder. Let me go through them one by one.

A: Major depressive disorder. Well, that's about persistent sadness, loss of interest, etc. But the key here is the memory issue, so maybe not the primary symptom here, unless it's a depressive disorder with some dissociative features, but I'm not sure.

B: Antisocial personality disorder. That's more about disregard for others' rights, lack of empathy. Doesn't seem to fit here.

C: Bipolar disorder. Involves mood swings, mania, and depression. Again, not directly related to memory loss.

D: Dissociative amnesia. Oh right, dissociative amnesia is when someone forgets information about themselves or events, especially traumatic ones, and it's not due to an organic cause. That sounds relevant because the man can't remember the traumatic event.

E: Conversion disorder, now called functional neurological symptom disorder. It involves neurological symptoms like paralysis or seizures without a medical cause, often linked to psychological trauma. But the main issue here is memory loss, not neurological symptoms.

F: Obsessive-compulsive disorder. That's about unwanted thoughts and repetitive behaviors. Doesn't fit the scenario.

G: Schizophrenia. Involves delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking. Memory loss isn't a primary symptom here.

H: Generalized anxiety disorder. Excessive worry about everyday things. Not directly related to the memory issue described.

I: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD involves symptoms after a traumatic event, like flashbacks, nightmares, severe anxiety, etc. But one of the symptoms can be memory problems, including dissociative amnesia. Wait, is that the same as dissociative amnesia or a different condition?

J: Panic disorder. Involves panic attacks and fear of having more. Not related to memory.

So the main options seem to be D and I. The man can't remember the traumatic event, which is a key point. In PTSD, people often have trouble remembering the event, but I think dissociative amnesia is more specifically about the inability to recall the trauma.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. I remember that dissociative amnesia is a separate disorder, but sometimes it can be a symptom within PTSD. For example, in the DSM-5, dissociative symptoms can be part of PTSD, especially in the dissociative subtype.

But in this question, the man has no memory of the event and gets upset when reminded. So is this more indicative of dissociative amnesia or PTSD?

I think dissociative amnesia is when the memory loss is the primary symptom, and it's not part of a broader set of PTSD symptoms. PTSD would include more symptoms like flashbacks, avoidance of triggers, hypervigilance, etc. The question doesn't mention those other symptoms, just the memory issue.

So the most likely diagnosis would be dissociative amnesia (option D).

Wait, but another angle: if the man is getting upset when people tell him he must remember, does that point to something else? Like avoidance, which is a symptom of PTSD? Or is the upset because he can't remember, which is more about the amnesia itself.

I think it's the latter. His main issue is the lack of memory, so D seems correct.

The man in the scenario is unable to remember a traumatic event where his wife and children were killed, and he becomes upset when reminded of it. The key symptom here is the inability to recall the traumatic event, which points to a memory-related disorder. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Major depressive disorder**: Focuses on mood symptoms like sadness and loss of interest, not memory loss.
- **B: Antisocial personality disorder**: Involves disregard for others, unrelated to memory issues.
- **C: Bipolar disorder**: Characterized by mood swings, not relevant here.
- **D: Dissociative amnesia**: Involves forgetting traumatic events, which fits the scenario.
- **E: Conversion disorder**: Involves neurological symptoms without memory loss as the primary issue.
- **F: Obsessive-compulsive disorder**: Focuses on unwanted thoughts and repetitive behaviors, not memory loss.
- **G: Schizophrenia**: Involves delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thinking, unrelated to memory loss.
- **H: Generalized anxiety disorder**: Involves excessive worry, not memory-related.
- **I: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**: While PTSD can include memory issues, it typically involves a broader set of symptoms like flashbacks and hypervigilance, which are not mentioned here.
- **J: Panic disorder**: Involves panic attacks, unrelated to memory loss.

The primary symptom in this case is the inability to recall the traumatic event, which aligns most closely with **dissociative amnesia**. While PTSD can include memory issues, the lack of other PTSD symptoms like flashbacks or avoidance behaviors makes dissociative amnesia the more specific diagnosis.
