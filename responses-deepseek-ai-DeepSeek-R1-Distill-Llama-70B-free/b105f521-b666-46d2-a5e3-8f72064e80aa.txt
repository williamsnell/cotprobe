Okay, so I have this question about plant tissues and which one is responsible for new growth. Hmm, let's think. I remember from my biology class that plants have different types of tissues, each with specific functions. 

The question is asking about new growth, so I'm guessing it's related to areas where the plant is actively growing. I think the term is something like meristematic tissue. Wait, where have I heard that before? Oh right, meristems are regions where growth occurs. They're like the growing points of the plant, found at the tips of roots and stems. 

Let me go through the options to make sure. Option A is Apical tissue. Apical refers to the tip, like the shoot apex, which does have meristematic tissue. But is the tissue called apical tissue? Or is that just a location? I think the actual tissue is meristematic. So while apical is related, the correct term might be meristematic.

Option B is Sclerenchyma. I know that's a type of support tissue, providing structure when the cell is dead and has thick walls. It's not involved in growth but more in support, so probably not this.

Option C, Ground tissue. Ground tissue makes up most of the plant body and includes various functions like storage, photosynthesis, and support. But it's not primarily responsible for new growth. It's more about the bulk of the plant.

Option D, Vascular tissue. That's for transportâ€”xylem and phloem. Important for moving water, nutrients, and sugars, but not the growth itself.

Option E, Cork tissue. That's the outer protective layer, like the bark. It protects but doesn't grow. So no.

Option F, Collenchyma. This is a support tissue with living cells and flexible walls. They provide support but aren't the growth tissue.

Option G, Periderm. That's the cork cambium and cork cells. Again, part of the protective outer layers, not growth.

Option H, Parenchyma. These are general plant cells, involved in various functions like photosynthesis, storage, etc. They're the most common, but not specifically for growth. Unless they're part of meristematic tissue.

Option I, Epidermal tissue. That's the outer covering, like the skin of the plant. Protective, not growth.

Option J, Meristematic tissue. Yes, this rings a bell. Meristematic cells are undifferentiated and continuously divide to produce new tissues. They're found in areas like root tips, shoot tips, and lateral meristems. So this must be the correct answer.

So the answer is J: Meristematic tissue.

The tissue responsible for new growth in plants is meristematic tissue. This type of tissue consists of undifferentiated cells that continuously divide, contributing to the growth in regions such as the tips of roots and stems. Other options like apical tissue refer to locations where meristematic tissue is found, but the correct term for the tissue itself is meristematic.

Answer: J
