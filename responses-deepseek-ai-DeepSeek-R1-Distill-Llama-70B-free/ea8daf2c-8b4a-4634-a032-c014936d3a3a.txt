Okay, so I've got this problem here about discounts, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is asking how to express a discount series of 20% and then 10% as a single discount. Hmm, I remember that when you have multiple discounts, you can't just add them up. Let me think about why that is.

So, let's say an item originally costs $100. If I apply a 20% discount first, I'm taking 20% off of 100, which is $20. So the price becomes $80 after the first discount. Now, the second discount is 10%, but this time it's applied to the new price of $80, not the original $100. So 10% of 80 is $8. Subtracting that brings the final price down to $72.

Wait, but how does that translate into a single equivalent discount? I think I need to find out what single percentage, when applied to the original $100, would result in $72. 

Let me calculate the total amount saved. The original is $100, and the final is $72, so the total discount is $28. That's because 100 minus 72 is 28. So the total discount is 28% off the original price. 

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Sometimes when I'm dealing with percentages, I can get confused. So, the first discount is 20%, which leaves 80% of the price. The second discount is 10%, so it's 90% of that reduced price. So the overall effect is 0.8 * 0.9 = 0.72, which is 72% of the original price. Therefore, the discount is 100% -72% =28%. 

I think that's right. So looking at the options, option A is 28%, so that should be the correct answer. 

Wait, just to double-check, let me try another example. Suppose the original price is different, like $200. First discount of 20% would leave $160. Then a 10% discount on 160 is $16 off, so final price is $144. The total discount from 200 to 144 is $56. 56 is what percentage of 200? (56/200)*100 =28%. Yep, same result. So I'm pretty confident the answer is 28%, which is option A.

To determine the equivalent single discount for the series 20%-10%, we need to calculate the combined effect of the two discounts and express it as a single percentage.

1. **Apply the first discount (20%)**:  
   If the original price is $100, a 20% discount reduces the price to $80 (since 20% of 100 is 20, and 100 - 20 = 80).

2. **Apply the second discount (10%)**:  
   The second discount is applied to the reduced price of $80. A 10% discount on $80 is $8 (since 10% of 80 is 8), leaving a final price of $72 (80 - 8 = 72).

3. **Calculate the total discount**:  
   The original price is $100, and the final price after both discounts is $72. The total discount is $100 - $72 = $28.  

4. **Express the total discount as a percentage**:  
   The total discount of $28 on the original price of $100 corresponds to a 28% discount (since \( \frac{28}{100} \times 100 = 28\% \)).

Thus, the equivalent single discount for the series 20%-10% is **28%**.

The correct answer is **A: 28%**.
