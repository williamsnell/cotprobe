Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about reaction rates and determining the order of a reactant. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question says that in determining the order for reactant A, all other reactants are held constant. So, I remember that when you're finding the rate law, you vary one reactant at a time while keeping others constant. That way, you can isolate the effect of each reactant on the rate.

So in this case, they're changing the concentration of A. The problem states that the concentration of A is tripled from one experiment to another. When they do that, the reaction rate is also found to triple. I need to find the exponent for A in the rate law, which tells me the order with respect to A.

Wait, the rate law is generally expressed as rate = k[A]^m, where m is the order. So when other concentrations are held constant, the rate depends only on [A]^m. 

Let me think about how changing [A] affects the rate. Suppose the concentration of A is tripled. So if [A] becomes 3[A], then the rate becomes 3 times the original rate. 

So mathematically, when [A] triples, the rate becomes 3 * initial rate. Let's plug this into the rate law. 

Original rate: rate1 = k[A]^m

New rate: rate2 = k*(3[A])^m

But we know that rate2 is 3*rate1. So,

k*(3[A])^m = 3 * k[A]^m

Hmm, I can divide both sides by k[A]^m to simplify. 

(3[A])^m / [A]^m = 3

Which simplifies to 3^m = 3.

Because (3^m)*(A^m / A^m) = 3^m. And A^m / A^m is 1, so 3^m =3.

So 3^m =3 implies that m is 1, because 3^1 =3.

So the exponent m, which is the order of the reaction with respect to A, is 1.

Looking at the options, J is 1. So the correct answer should be J.

To determine the order of reactant A in the rate law, we analyze how the reaction rate changes when the concentration of A is tripled, while keeping all other reactants constant. The rate law is expressed as:

\[
\text{rate} = k[A]^m
\]

where \(m\) is the order with respect to A. Initially, the rate is:

\[
\text{rate}_1 = k[A]^m
\]

When the concentration of A is tripled, the new rate becomes:

\[
\text{rate}_2 = k(3[A])^m
\]

The problem states that tripling the concentration of A triples the reaction rate, so:

\[
\text{rate}_2 = 3 \cdot \text{rate}_1
\]

Substituting the expressions for \(\text{rate}_1\) and \(\text{rate}_2\):

\[
k(3[A])^m = 3 \cdot k[A]^m
\]

Dividing both sides by \(k[A]^m\):

\[
(3[A])^m / [A]^m = 3
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
3^m = 3
\]

This implies \(m = 1\), as \(3^1 = 3\). Therefore, the exponent for A in the rate law is 1, meaning the reaction is first-order with respect to A.

The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{J}
\]
