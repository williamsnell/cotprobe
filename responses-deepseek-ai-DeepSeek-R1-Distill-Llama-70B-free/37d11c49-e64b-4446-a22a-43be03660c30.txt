Okay, so I've got this problem about using the Knudsen method to determine the vapor pressure of beryllium. Hmm, I remember that the Knudsen effusion method is used to measure the vapor pressure of solids, especially when it's really low. Right, because at high temperatures, solids can vaporize, but the pressure is so low that normal methods don't work.

The question says that a sample of beryllium powder is in a box with an effusion hole. The hole's diameter is 3.18 mm. Wait, so I probably need the area of that hole. The radius would be half the diameter, so 1.59 mm, which I should convert to meters. Oh wait, 1 mm is 0.001 meters, so 1.59 mm is 0.00159 m. The area A is πr². So A = π*(0.00159/2)^2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the diameter is 3.18 mm, so radius is 1.59 mm. So the area is π*(1.59 mm)^2. But wait, I need to convert mm to meters, right? So 1.59 mm is 0.00159 meters. So area A is π*(0.00159 m / 2)^2? No, wait, no, wait. No, the radius is half the diameter, so radius r is 1.59 mm, which is 0.00159 m. So area A is π*(0.00159)^2 m². Let me calculate that.

Wait, wait, no: the diameter is 3.18 mm, so radius is 3.18/2 = 1.59 mm. So yes, correct. So A is π*(0.00159 m)^2. Let's compute that: 0.00159 squared is about 2.5281e-6 m², multiplied by π (approx 3.1416) gives around 7.95e-6 m². Hmm, but wait, maybe I should be more precise with the calculations.

Next, the time given is 15.2 minutes, but I think I need it in seconds for the formula. Right, because the units for effusion are in seconds. So 15.2 minutes * 60 = 912 seconds.

The mass that effused is 8.88 mg, which is 8.88e-6 kg. Oh wait, but wait, the molar mass of beryllium is needed. Beryllium's atomic weight is about 9 g/mol. So molar mass M is 0.009 kg/mol.

I think the formula for Knudsen effusion is something like the rate of effusion (dN/dt) is equal to (PA)/(√(2πMRT)), where P is the vapor pressure, A is the area of the hole, M is the molar mass, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

Wait, but I might be mixing up the formula. Alternatively, I remember that the mass effused (m) is related to the vapor pressure via m = (PA * sqrt(M/(2πRT))) ) * t. Because mass would be moles multiplied by molar mass, so let me think. Let's see, the number of moles that effuse is n = (PA * t) / sqrt(2πM R T). Then, the mass m is n * M, so m = (PA M t) / sqrt(2π M R T). Wait, simplifying that, the M in the numerator and denominator would cancel? Let me see:

Wait, M in numerator is molar mass, denominator has sqrt(M), so overall it would be sqrt(M) in the denominator. Wait, perhaps I should rederive this.

The effusion rate in terms of mass is dm/dt. So the number of molecules effusing per second is (P A) / sqrt(2 π M R T), but wait, that's in terms of molecules per second. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of mass per time.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

m = (P A t) / sqrt(2 π M R T)

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the formula is:

m = (P A t) / (sqrt(2 π M R T))

Wait, I think the correct formula relates the mass effused (m) to the pressure (P), the area (A), time (t), and the square root term involving M, R, and T.

Wait, another approach: the Knudsen equation is often written as:

m = (P A t) * sqrt(M/(2 π R T)) )

Wait, that would make sense because m is mass, which is moles multiplied by molar mass. So, let me think again.

The number of moles that escape is n = (P A t) / (sqrt(2 π M R T)) ). Because the flux (moles per time) is P A / sqrt(2 π M R T). Then, mass m is n * M, so m = (P A t * M) / sqrt(2 π M R T).

Simplifying that, the M in the numerator and denominator would give sqrt(M) in the denominator. So m = (P A t) * sqrt(M) / sqrt(2 π R T) )

Wait, let's write it clearly:

n = (P A t) / sqrt(2 π M R T)
m = n * M = (P A t M) / sqrt(2 π M R T) = (P A t sqrt(M)) ) / sqrt(2 π R T)

So,

m = (P A t sqrt(M)) ) / sqrt(2 π R T)

Wait, but perhaps it's better to keep it in terms of molar mass without taking the square roots yet. Let me see, perhaps the formula is:

m = (P A t) / sqrt(2 π M R T / (M)) )

Wait, no, perhaps I should look up the formula again. I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, another approach: the Knudsen equation for the mass loss rate is (dm/dt) = (P A M) / (sqrt(2 π M R T)) )

Wait, that would make the mass rate dm/dt equal to (P A) divided by sqrt(2 π R T / M) ), because M cancels in the square root.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

dm/dt = (P A) / sqrt( (2 π R T) / M ) )

So,

dm/dt = (P A) * sqrt( M / (2 π R T) )

Then, over time t, the total mass m is dm/dt * t = (P A t) * sqrt(M/(2 π R T)) 

So,

m = (P A t) * sqrt( M / (2 π R T) )

Yes, this looks correct. So, rearranging to solve for P:

P = m / (A t * sqrt( M / (2 π R T) )) )

Which can be written as:

P = m * sqrt(2 π R T) / (A t * sqrt(M) )

Wait, let me square the denominator to make it clearer. Let me write it again:

P = (m) / (A t) * sqrt( (2 π R T) / M )

So,

P = (m) / (A t) * sqrt( (2 π R T) / M )

Yes, that's the right way. So now I can plug in all the numbers.

Let's list the known values:

m = 8.88 mg = 8.88e-6 kg

A: diameter d = 3.18 mm, radius r = 1.59 mm = 0.00159 m

Area A = π r² = π (0.00159 m)^2

Calculate A:

r = 0.00159 m

r squared is (0.00159)^2 = (approx) 2.528e-6 m²

Multiply by π: 2.528e-6 * 3.1416 ≈ 7.95e-6 m².

t = 15.2 minutes = 15.2 *60 = 912 seconds.

M = molar mass of Be = 9 g/mol = 0.009 kg/mol

R is the gas constant. I think R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), but sometimes it's used in different units. Let me confirm: yes, R = 8.314 J/(mol·K)

T = 1537 K

So putting it all into the equation:

P = (m) / (A t) * sqrt( (2 π R T) / M )

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute the numerator: m / (A t)

m = 8.88e-6 kg

A t = 7.95e-6 m² * 912 s ≈ 7.95e-6 * 9.12e2 = let's compute 7.95 * 9.12 = approx 72.624, and 1e-6 * 1e2 is 1e-4, so 72.624e-4 = 7.2624e-3 m²·s

So m/(A t) = 8.88e-6 kg / 7.2624e-3 m²·s ≈ 1.222e-3 kg/(m²·s)

Next, compute the square root part: sqrt( (2 π R T) / M )

Compute 2 π R T: 2 * π * 8.314 J/(mol·K) * 1537 K.

First, compute 2 * π ≈ 6.2832

6.2832 * 8.314 ≈ let's see: 6 *8=48, 6*0.314=1.884, 0.2832*8≈2.2656, 0.2832*0.314≈0.0889. So adding all up: 48 +1.884=49.884, +2.2656=52.1496, +0.0889≈52.2385.

So 6.2832 * 8.314 ≈ 52.24 (approx)

Multiply by T=1537 K: 52.24 * 1537 ≈ Let's compute 50 *1537=76,850 and 2.24*1537≈3,442. So total ≈ 76,850 +3,442=80,292. So 2 π R T ≈ 80,292 J/mol

Wait, more accurately:

Wait, 2 * π is about 6.283185307. R=8.314 J/mol K.

So 6.283185307 * 8.314 = let's compute that precisely.

6 * 8.314 = 49.884

0.283185307 *8.314 ≈ Let's compute 0.2 *8.314=1.6628, 0.08*8.314=0.66512, 0.003185307*8.314≈0.0265. Adding them: 1.6628 +0.66512=2.32792 +0.0265≈2.3544.

So total 6.283185 *8.314 ≈49.884 +2.3544≈52.2384.

Now multiply by T=1537 K: 52.2384 *1537.

Compute 50 *1537 =76,850.

2.2384 *1537: Let's compute 2 *1537=3074, 0.2384 *1537≈approx 0.2 *1537=307.4, 0.0384 *1537≈59. So 307.4+59=366.4, so 0.2384 *1537≈366.4. So 2.2384 *1537≈3074 +366.4=3440.4.

So 52.2384 *1537≈76,850 +3,440.4=80,290.4 J/mol.

Now, M is 0.009 kg/mol, which is 9 g/mol. So,

(2 π R T) / M = 80,290.4 / 0.009 = approx 8,921,483 (since 80,290 /0.009 = 80,290 * 1000/9 ≈ 8922,222.22...). Let me compute 80,290.4 / 0.009:

80,290.4 / 0.009 = 80,290.4 * (1/0.009) = 80,290.4 * 111.111... ≈ 80,290.4 * 1000/9.

So 80,290.4 * 1000 = 80,290,400, divided by 9: 80,290,400 /9 ≈8,921,483 (since 9*8,921,483=80,293,427 which is a bit higher, but approximate).

So sqrt(8,921,483) ≈2983.6. Because 3000^2=9,000,000, which is bigger. Let's see, 2983^2= approx (3000-17)^2=9,000,000 - 2*3000*17 +17²=9,000,000 -102,000 +289=8,898,289. Hmm, but my value is 8,921,483, which is higher. So perhaps 2983.6 is a good approximation.

Wait, maybe I can compute it more accurately. Let me see:

Find x where x²=8,921,483.

So, 2983^2 = (2980 +3)^2=2980² +2*2980*3 +3²=8,880,400 +17,880 +9=8,898,289.

2983^2=8,898,289.

The target is 8,921,483.

The difference is 8,921,483 -8,898,289=23,194.

Each increment of x by 1 increases x² by approximately 2*x +1. So, at x=2983, each step adds about 5966 +1=5967 per x.

So, 23,194 /5966 ≈3.88, so x≈2983 +3.88≈2986.88. So x≈2986.88.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me try 2984^2:

(2980+4)^2=2980² +2*2980*4 +4²=8,880,400 +23,840 +16=8,904,256.

Compare to target 8,921,483.

Difference: 8,921,483-8,904,256=17,227.

At x=2984, each step adds about 2*2984 +1=5968+1=5969.

So 17,227 /5969≈2.886. So x≈2984 +2.886≈2986.886.

So sqrt(8,921,483)≈2986.886.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me just use 2987 for the square root.

So, sqrt((2 π R T)/M) ≈2987.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculation because perhaps I made a mistake in the values.

Wait, earlier I had 80,290 J/mol when I divided by 0.009 kg/mol. Wait, no, (2 π R T) was 80,290.4 J/mol, and M is 0.009 kg/mol. So (2 π R T)/M is 80,290.4 / 0.009 = approx 8,921,488 J·mol^-1.

So sqrt(8,921,488 J/mol) is in sqrt(J/mol), but J is kg·m²/s², so units would be sqrt( kg·m²/(s²·mol) ), but I'm not sure if I need to worry about the units here, since I'm just calculating the numerical value.

Wait, but actually, the term inside the square root is (2 π R T)/M. R is in J/(mol·K) = (kg·m²)/(s²·mol·K), T is K, so R*T is (kg·m²)/(s²·mol). M is kg/mol, so (R*T)/M is (kg·m²)/(s²·mol) * mol/kg )= m²/s². So the square root is m/s, which is velocity units. So, sqrt( (2 π R T)/M ) has units of m/s, which makes sense because it's related to the root mean square speed or something similar.

But perhaps the exact units aren't necessary for the calculation. Let's proceed.

So, putting it back into P:

P = (m/(A t)) * sqrt( (2 π R T)/M )

We have m/(A t) ≈1.222e-3 kg/(m²·s)

sqrt( (2 π R T)/M ) ≈2987 m/s

So,

P ≈1.222e-3 kg/(m²·s) * 2987 m/s

Multiply those together: 1.222e-3 *2987 = approx 3.65 kg/(m·s²)

Wait, because (kg/(m²·s)) * (m/s) )= kg/(m·s²) ), which is equivalent to Pa (Pascal). Since 1 atm is about 101325 Pa.

So P ≈3.65 Pa, but wait, that's way too low. But the options are in the order of 1e-4 atm, which is about 1e-4 * 1e5 Pa = 10 Pa. So 3.65 Pa is about 3.6e-5 atm, perhaps?

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 1 atm = 101325 Pa.

So, 3.65 Pa = 3.65 / 101325 atm ≈3.6e-5 atm.

Looking at the options: option C is 6.67e-5 atm, option B is 5.67e-5, option D is 4.67e-5, option J is 2.67e-5.

Wait, my approximation gave about 3.6e-5 atm, which isn't exactly any of the options, but perhaps my initial approximations were rough.

Wait, let me go back and be more precise with the numbers.

Let me recompute each step more accurately.

First, compute A:

d = 3.18 mm → r =1.59 mm =
