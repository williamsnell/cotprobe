Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question in front of me. Let me read it carefully. The question is about the principal effect of current concerns aimed at improving employment opportunities for the educationally or socially disadvantaged. Specifically, it's asking which type of employment tests are being encouraged now.

The options are A through H, each listing different types of tests. I need to figure out which one is the correct answer based on what I know about employment testing and policies related to disadvantaged groups.

Hmm, I remember that there's been a move towards making employment tests fairer and more inclusive. Traditional tests might have biases that disadvantage certain groups. So, the concern is probably pushing for tests that are more job-relevant and less about general abilities which might not be fair to everyone.

Let me think about each option:

A: Intelligence quotient tests. IQ tests are pretty traditional and have been criticized for being biased towards certain groups. They might not accurately reflect job capabilities, especially for people who didn't have access to good education. So I don't think this is the right answer because the concern is about helping disadvantaged groups, and IQ tests might not do that.

B: Norm-referenced tests. These tests compare individuals against a normative sample. They can show where someone stands relative to others, but they might not directly assess job-specific skills. I'm not sure if this is the best fit.

C: Tests that assess physical abilities. These would be relevant for jobs requiring physical strength or stamina. But not all jobs are physical, and this doesn't directly address educational or social disadvantages. So maybe not the answer.

D: Work-sample types of tests. Work samples are tests that mirror the actual tasks someone would perform on the job. They assess whether the person can do the specific job requirements. This seems more relevant because it focuses on the ability to perform the job rather than general knowledge or education. This could help disadvantaged individuals who might have the skills but not the formal education.

E: Timed tests of a narrow range of abilities. Timed tests can be problematic because they might stress some people or not reflect their true abilities. If the range is narrow, it might not capture all necessary skills. Not sure if this is better for disadvantaged groups.

F: Personality assessment tests. These measure traits like extroversion or conscientiousness. While useful in some cases, they might not directly indicate job competence, especially for roles where specific skills are needed. Also, personality tests can be subjective and might not be the focus here.

G: Tests based solely on academic performance. This would likely disadvantage those who didn't have strong academic backgrounds, which is exactly the group the question is about. So this probably isn't the answer.

H: Tests based on social skills. Social skills are important in many jobs, but again, they might not directly measure job-specific abilities. Also, socially disadvantaged individuals might have different social skill sets that could be misjudged in such tests.

So, putting it all together, work-sample tests (option D) seem like the most appropriate answer. They directly assess the ability to perform job tasks, which is fairer and more relevant than other types of tests that might be biased against educationally or socially disadvantaged individuals. By using work samples, employers can better determine who can actually do the job, regardless of their background.

The principal effect of the current concern to improve employment opportunities for the educationally or socially disadvantaged has been to encourage the use of tests that directly assess job-specific abilities rather than general knowledge or traits. Among the options provided, work-sample types of tests (option D) are the most appropriate because they mirror actual job tasks, focusing on whether an individual can perform the specific requirements of the role. This approach is fairer and more inclusive, as it emphasizes practical skills over formal education or social background, thereby helping to level the playing field for disadvantaged groups.

Answer: D
