Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics question here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question is about what happens to U.S. net exports and the values of the dollar and yen if the Japanese economy goes into a deep and prolonged recession.

Hmm, I remember that net exports are a part of a country's GDP, calculated as exports minus imports. So if the U.S. is exporting goods to Japan, and Japan's economy is in a recession, that probably means Japanese people and businesses are buying less stuff, including imports from the U.S. So U.S. exports to Japan would decrease, right? That would make U.S. net exports go down because exports are a positive component and if they decrease, net exports would decrease. So U.S. net exports would decrease. So looking at the options, I can cross out any that say net exports increase.

Wait, but I should think about other factors too. Sometimes, currencies play a role. If Japan is in a recession, maybe their currency, the yen, would weaken. Because a weak economy might cause their currency to depreciate. So the yen's value would go down compared to the dollar. Wait, no—when a currency weakens, its value in terms of another currency (like the dollar) decreases. So if the yen is weaker, one dollar can buy more yen, which means the dollar has appreciated relative to the yen.

So if the yen decreases in value, Japanese goods become cheaper for Americans to buy. That could lead to the U.S. importing more from Japan because it's cheaper. But wait, the U.S. is exporting less to Japan because Japan is in a recession and buying less. So net exports (exports minus imports) would go down because exports fell and imports might rise, but I'm not sure if imports rise enough to offset that.

Wait, but wait again. If the yen is weaker, Japanese goods are cheaper, so U.S. imports from Japan increase. But at the same time, Japan is in a recession, so maybe they're not producing as much? Or maybe their demand for imports from the U.S. decreases, so the U.S. exports less. So both factors would affect the U.S. trade balance.

So, U.S. net exports would be exports minus imports. Exports to Japan decrease (so that's a negative), and imports from Japan increase (so that's a negative as well, because it's subtracted when calculating net exports). So both happening would make net exports decrease. So the U.S. net exports would decrease.

Now, about the dollar and yen values. If Japan's economy is in a recession, their currency, the yen, would likely depreciate (lose value). So the yen's value decreases. The dollar, compared to the yen, would appreciate because it becomes stronger relative to the yen. So the value of the dollar would increase, and the yen's value would decrease.

So putting it together: U.S. net exports decrease, the dollar's value increases, and the yen's value decreases.

Looking at the options, let's see. Each option has three parts: U.S. Net Exports, Value of Dollar, Value of Yen.

Looking for Decrease, Increase, Decrease.

Looking at the options:

Option E: Decreases, Increases, Decreases. That's exactly what I concluded.

But wait, let me double-check. Are there other dynamics I might be missing? For example, sometimes during a recession, a country might implement policies that affect exchange rates. Like Japan might lower interest rates, which could affect currency values. Or maybe investors move their money to safer currencies like the dollar if Japan's economy is in trouble, causing the dollar to strengthen.

Yes, that's another point. In times of economic uncertainty, investors often move to safer assets, like U.S. Treasury bonds, which are denominated in dollars. So the demand for dollars would increase, making the dollar stronger (appreciate) and the yen weaker (depreciate). So that supports the earlier conclusion.

So the correct answer would be E: U.S. net exports decrease, the dollar's value increases, and the yen's value decreases.

If the Japanese economy were to suffer a deep and prolonged recession, several economic effects would likely occur:

1. **U.S. Net Exports**: A recession in Japan would reduce Japanese demand for imports, including goods from the U.S. As a result, U.S. exports to Japan would decrease. Additionally, a weaker yen would make Japanese goods cheaper for U.S. consumers, potentially increasing U.S. imports from Japan. Both factors—reduced exports and increased imports—would lead to a decrease in U.S. net exports.

2. **Value of the Dollar**: During a recession, investors often seek safer assets, such as U.S. Treasury bonds, which are denominated in dollars. This increased demand for dollars would cause the dollar to appreciate (increase in value) relative to other currencies, including the yen.

3. **Value of the Yen**: A deep and prolonged recession in Japan could lead to a depreciation of the yen. This is because a weak economy often results in lower interest rates and reduced investor confidence, both of which can cause the currency to lose value on the foreign exchange market.

Putting these effects together, U.S. net exports would decrease, the value of the dollar would increase, and the value of the yen would decrease. The correct answer is:

**E: Decreases, Increases, Decreases**
