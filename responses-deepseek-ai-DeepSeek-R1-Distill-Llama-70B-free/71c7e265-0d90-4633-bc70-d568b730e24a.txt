Question:

A man and a woman were arrested and charged with bank robbery. After receiving Miranda warnings, both requested an attorney. Following their arrests, the man and the woman were placed in separate jail cells. The next day before arraignment, the man asked a police officer if he could see his friend, the woman. The man was taken to the woman's jail cell and allowed to talk to her. Neither defendant knew that the police had placed a listening device in the woman's jail cell. As a result, their conversation was being overheard and recorded by the police. The police planted the listening device without first securing a warrant. While they were together, the man told the woman not to admit to anything because they could beat the charges with the help of a good lawyer. At trial, the prosecution sought to introduce the man's incriminating statement into evidence. The man's attorney has filed a motion to exclude. The motion should be

Options:

A: denied, because the statement did not violate the man's Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.
B: denied, because the conversation occurred after the defendants were given their Miranda warnings.
C: granted, because the man was not informed that his conversation would be recorded.
D: denied, because the man voluntarily made the statement to the woman.
E: denied, because the defendants did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy.
F: granted, because the police used illegal methods to gather evidence.
G: granted, because both defendants requested an attorney before engaging in their conversation.
H: granted, because the police violated the woman's privacy by placing a listening device in her cell.
I: denied, because the defendants were in police custody and should have assumed their conversation could be overheard.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this law question. Let me read it carefully.

So, there's a man and a woman arrested for bank robbery. Both were given Miranda warnings and asked for an attorney. Then they were put in separate cells. The next day, before arraignment, the man asked to see the woman, and the police took him to her cell. They talked, but the police had a listening device in her cell without a warrant. The police overheard them, and the man told the woman not to admit anything because they could beat the charges with a good lawyer. Now, the prosecution wants to use that statement, and the man's attorney is trying to get it excluded.

The question is whether the motion to exclude should be granted or denied. The options are A through J.

Hmm. I remember that Miranda rights are involved when someone is in custody and being questioned. But here, both requested attorneys, so I think that's important. Also, the conversation was recorded without a warrant, which might be an issue under the Fourth Amendment.

Wait, so the man was taken to the woman's cell, and they talked there. The police were listening without a warrant. So, was their conversation private? Or did they have an expectation of privacy?

I recall that in a jail setting, the expectation of privacy is limited. Like, in jail cells, prisoners might not have as much expectation of privacy because they're under surveillance. But this is a conversation between two people in a cell. So, maybe they thought they were talking privately.

But wait, when the man was moved to the woman's cell, was that a place where others could overhear? Or was it a private area? Also, the police planted the device without a warrant, which sounds like a potential Fourth Amendment violation.

In the case of Massiah v. United States, the Supreme Court held that the government cannot deliberately elicit incriminating statements from a defendant after indictment (or here, after being charged) without counsel present, violating the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.

Wait, but in this case, the man was talking to the woman, not directly to the police. So, does that still apply? Because the police were listening in, perhaps using a listening device without a warrant.

Another angle: once a defendant has requested an attorney, any interrogation without the attorney present is prohibited under the Fifth Amendment. But here, the man was talking to his co-defendant, not the police. So, is this considered interrogation?

Alternatively, under the Fourth Amendment, if the listening device was placed without a warrant and the conversation was recorded, that might be an unreasonable search and seizure. But whether they had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the jail cell is key.

In the case of Lanza v. New York, the Court held that a defendant in jail doesn't have an expectation of privacy in a visitor's room when speaking with his wife, because such conversations are subject to surveillance.

Wait, but in this case, the conversation was between two co-defendants in a cell, and the listening device was planted without a warrant. So, perhaps the expectation of privacy is lower, but the method of obtaining the evidence (without a warrant) might still be an issue.

Wait, but I remember that in the case of a jail cell, the government can monitor conversations because there's no expectation of privacy. So, the police might not need a warrant to listen in, as there's no reasonable expectation of privacy.

Alternatively, if the listening device was planted without a warrant, but the place was a jail cell where privacy isn't expected, then maybe it's allowed.

But wait, in the case of United States v. Caceres, the court held that the government's use of a listening device to monitor conversations in a jail cell without a warrant was permissible because inmates have a reduced expectation of privacy. So, in that case, the evidence wasn't suppressed.

But that's a circuit court decision; I'm not sure if it's the same as the Supreme Court's stance.

Alternatively, in the case of Katz v. United States, the Court said that what matters is whether the person has a reasonable expectation of privacy. So, if the conversation was happening in a place where they could reasonably expect privacy, then the warrantless recording would be a problem.

But in a jail cell, especially when the police are allowing them to meet, maybe they don't have that expectation. So, perhaps the police didn't need a warrant because the defendants didn't have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their conversation.

Wait, but the man and woman were in separate cells, and the man asked to see the woman. The police took him to her cell, so perhaps the police set up the meeting to record them. If the police arranged the meeting, then it might be a setup to get them to talk, which could be seen as a violation.

Wait, but if the meeting was voluntary, but the police were listening in, then it's a question of whether the recording was permissible.

Putting this together, the key issues are:

1. Did the police violate the Fourth Amendment by recording the conversation without a warrant, given that the defendants had a reasonable expectation of privacy?

2. Did the police violate the Sixth Amendment by intercepting the conversation after the defendants had requested an attorney?

For the Fourth Amendment, if the defendants had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the jail cell, then the warrantless recording is permissible. If they did, then it's a violation.

In Lanza v. New York, the Court held that a conversation in a jail visiting area was not protected because there's no expectation of privacy. Similarly, in a jail cell where they're allowed to talk, perhaps the same applies.

So, if the defendants were in a place where they should know they might be monitored, then no expectation of privacy, so the police don't need a warrant. Therefore, the recording is admissible, and the motion to exclude would be denied.

Alternatively, if the court finds that the defendants did have an expectation of privacy, then the evidence would be suppressed.

Another point: the man and woman were in custody and had requested attorneys. So, under the Fifth Amendment, any interrogation without an attorney present is prohibited. But here, the police aren't directly questioning them; they're just listening to their conversation. So, that's more of a Fourth Amendment issue than a Fifth Amendment one.

So, the issue is whether the recording violated the Fourth Amendment. If the expectation of privacy is absent, then the evidence is admissible.

Looking at the options:

Option E says the motion should be denied because the defendants didn't have a reasonable expectation of privacy. That seems to align with the Lanza case.

Another option is G: granted, because both requested an attorney before talking. But I think that relates to the Sixth Amendmentâ€”after being charged and requesting an attorney, any questioning without counsel is prohibited. But in this case, the police didn't question them; they just listened. So, that might not apply.

Option F says granted because police used illegal methods. If the recording was illegal (Fourth Amendment violation), then the evidence is excluded. But if no expectation of privacy, then it's legal, so F would be incorrect.

Option A: denied, because the statement didn't violate Fifth Amendment. That might be correct because the Fifth Amendment protects against compelled self-incrimination. Here, the man was talking voluntarily to the woman, so no compulsion. So A could be a contender.

Wait, but the issue is about the admissibility of the statement. So, if the recording was obtained unlawfully, then under the Fourth Amendment, it's excluded as fruit of the poisonous tree. But if the recording was lawful, then it's admissible.

So, if the court finds that the police's action was lawful (no expectation of privacy), then the statement is admissible, so the motion is denied. So, the options would be E or A.

Alternatively, the Fifth Amendment comes into play if the statement was compelled. But the man was speaking voluntarily, so the Fifth Amendment isn't violated. So A could be correct.

But wait, another point: the right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment. Once the man and woman requested counsel, any government interference with their ability to consult could be a problem. But in this case, the police are just listening, not interfering. So, maybe that's not the issue here.

Putting it all together, I think the main issue is the expectation of privacy. If they didn't have it, then the recording is allowed, so the statement is admissible. So the motion to exclude should be denied, making option E correct.

Wait, but another thought: the police placed the listening device without a warrant. Even if there's no expectation of privacy, some might argue that the police still need a warrant unless an exception applies. But in a jail, perhaps the warrantless search is allowed because it's a place of incarceration.

Alternatively, under the Fourth Amendment, if the recording was done without a warrant and without probable cause, it's a violation. But in a jail cell, maybe the police have the authority to monitor without a warrant.

Hmm, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the cases again.

In Lanza, the Court said that a conversation in a jail visiting area is not protected, so no expectation of privacy. So, applying that here, the conversation in the cell wouldn't have an expectation of privacy, so the police could record it without a warrant.

Therefore, the motion should be denied because the defendants didn't have a reasonable expectation of privacy. So the correct answer would be E.

Wait, but looking back, option E says "denied, because the defendants did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy." That makes sense.

Another option could be A, which says it doesn't violate the Fifth Amendment. But the question is about excluding the evidence, which would be under the Fourth Amendment if the recording was unlawful. So if the recording was lawful, then the evidence is admissible, so the motion is denied.

So, I think the answer is E.

The question revolves around whether the man's incriminating statement, overheard and recorded by the police through a warrantless listening device in the woman's jail cell, should be excluded at trial. The key issues are:

1. **Fourth Amendment**: Whether the defendants had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the jail cell. If they did not, the police's warrantless recording would be permissible.
2. **Fifth Amendment**: Whether the statement was compelled. Since the man spoke voluntarily to the woman, there was no compulsion, so the Fifth Amendment is not violated.
3. **Sixth Amendment**: Whether the police's actions interfered with the defendants' right to counsel. However, the police were merely listening to the conversation, not interrogating the defendants, so this is less relevant.

In **Lanza v. New York**, the Supreme Court held that individuals in jail do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in areas subject to surveillance, such as visiting rooms or cells. Applying this precedent, the man and woman likely did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their conversation in the jail cell. Therefore, the police's warrantless recording of their conversation was lawful, and the evidence is admissible.

Given this analysis, the motion to exclude the statement should be denied because the defendants did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy.
