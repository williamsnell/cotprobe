Okay, so I have this question about whether the function f(x, y) = [(x² - y²)/(x² + y²)] is continuous at the origin. I'm a bit rusty on my multivariable calculus, but let's try to work through this step by step.

First, I remember that for a function to be continuous at a point, the limit as you approach that point from any direction should equal the function's value at that point. So here, the point is (0,0), and the function's value there... wait, actually, when x and y are both 0, the denominator becomes 0, so the function is undefined. But I think the question is about the continuity when we define f(0,0) in some way, maybe by taking a limit. So maybe I should check if the limit exists as (x,y) approaches (0,0).

The function f(x,y) simplifies to (x² - y²)/(x² + y²). I've seen similar expressions before, like when dealing with polar coordinates. Oh wait, in polar coordinates, x = r cosθ and y = r sinθ. Let me try substituting that.

So substituting, the numerator becomes (r² cos²θ - r² sin²θ) = r² (cos²θ - sin²θ) = r² cos(2θ) because cos(2θ) is cos²θ - sin²θ. The denominator becomes r² (cos²θ + sin²θ) = r² since cos² + sin² =1. So the function simplifies to [r² cos(2θ)] / r², which is just cos(2θ). So in polar coordinates, f(r,θ) = cos(2θ).

Now, to find the limit as (x,y) approaches (0,0), that's equivalent to r approaching 0. So as r approaches 0, the function approaches cos(2θ). Wait, but that depends on θ, right? Because cos(2θ) varies depending on the angle θ.

That's a problem because for the limit to exist, it should approach the same value regardless of the direction (i.e., regardless of θ). But here, it's dependent on θ. So for example, if I approach along θ=0 (the x-axis), cos(0)=1. If I approach along θ=π/4, cos(π/2)=0. Along θ=π/2, cos(π)=-1. So the limit would be different depending on the path taken. That means the overall limit as (x,y) approaches (0,0) doesn't exist because it's path-dependent.

But wait, the question is about continuity at (0,0). Since f(0,0) isn't defined, maybe someone could define it in a way that makes the function continuous. But since the limit doesn't exist, we can't define f(0,0) to make it continuous. So the function isn't continuous at the origin.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A says it's continuous at (0,0), which would be incorrect because the limit doesn't exist there.

Option B says it's continuous along y=x. Well, along y=x, let's see: if y=x, then f(x,x) = (x² -x²)/(x² +x²) = 0/(2x²) = 0. So along that line, the function is 0 everywhere except at (0,0). So approaching (0,0) along y=x gives limit 0. But if we approach along y=-x, then f(x,-x) = (x² - x²)/(x² +x²) = 0 as well. Wait, no, wait: x² - y² when y=-x would be x² - x²=0. So along both y=x and y=-x, the function approaches 0, which is the same as approaching along those lines.

But wait, earlier when I considered polar coordinates, I saw that the limit depends on θ. So for some paths, the limit is 1, others 0, others -1, etc. So the limit isn't unique. Therefore, the overall limit doesn't exist, so the function can't be made continuous at (0,0).

Looking back at the options, option H says the function is not continuous at (0,0). So that would be correct.

Wait, but let me check the other options. Option C says it has a removable discontinuity. But a removable discontinuity would mean that the limit exists but the function isn't defined there. But in this case, the limit doesn't exist because it depends on the path. So C is incorrect.

Option D says it's continuous along y=-x, but since along that line the limit is 0, but elsewhere it's not. So D is true only along that line, but the function isn't continuous at (0,0) overall.

So the correct answer should be H: the function is not continuous at (0,0).

To determine if the function \( f(x, y) = \frac{x^2 - y^2}{x^2 + y^2} \) is continuous at the origin, we analyze the behavior of the function as \((x, y)\) approaches \((0, 0)\). 

First, note that \( f(0, 0) \) is undefined because the denominator becomes zero. To assess continuity, we check if the limit of \( f(x, y) \) as \((x, y) \to (0, 0)\) exists and is equal to \( f(0, 0) \) (if defined). 

Rewriting the function in polar coordinates, where \( x = r \cos\theta \) and \( y = r \sin\theta \), we get:

\[
f(r, \theta) = \frac{r^2 \cos^2\theta - r^2 \sin^2\theta}{r^2} = \cos(2\theta).
\]

As \( r \to 0 \), the function depends only on \(\theta\), meaning the limit varies with the direction of approach. For example:
- Along \( \theta = 0 \) (the x-axis), \( \cos(2\theta) = 1 \).
- Along \( \theta = \pi/4 \), \( \cos(2\theta) = 0 \).
- Along \( \theta = \pi/2 \), \( \cos(2\theta) = -1 \).

Since the limit depends on the path taken, the overall limit as \((x, y) \to (0, 0)\) does not exist. Therefore, the function cannot be made continuous at the origin by defining \( f(0, 0) \).

Analyzing the options:
- **A**: Incorrect. The function is not continuous at \((0, 0)\) because the limit does not exist.
- **B**: Incorrect. While the function is continuous along \( y = x \), this does not imply continuity at \((0, 0)\).
- **C**: Incorrect. A removable discontinuity requires the limit to exist, which is not the case here.
- **D**: Incorrect. The function is continuous along \( y = -x \), but this does not ensure continuity at \((0, 0)\).
- **E**: Incorrect. The function is not continuous at all points, particularly at the origin.
- **F**: Incorrect. The function is not continuous at \((0, 0)\), but it is continuous elsewhere.
- **G**: Incorrect. The function is not continuous only at the origin; it is continuous elsewhere.
- **H**: Correct. The function is not continuous at \((0, 0)\) because the limit does not exist.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**H**
