Options:

A: .44, 0.6, 0.2
B: .5, 0.6, 0.3
C: .44, 0.5, 0.3
D: .5, 0.44, 0.3
E: .5, 0.44, 0.2
F: 0.6, 0.44, 0.3
G: 0.5, 0.5, 0.3
H: 0.6, 0.44, 0.2
I: 0.44, 0.5, 0.2
J: .44, 0.5, 0.2

To determine the probabilities \( P(A \cup B) \) under different conditions, we analyze each scenario:

1. **When A and B are mutually exclusive**:
   - Mutually exclusive events cannot occur simultaneously, so \( P(A \cap B) = 0 \).
   - The union probability is \( P(A) + P(B) = 0.3 + 0.2 = 0.5 \).

2. **When A and B are independent**:
   - For independent events, \( P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B) = 0.3 \cdot 0.2 = 0.06 \).
   - The union probability is \( P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) = 0.3 + 0.2 - 0.06 = 0.44 \).

3. **When B is a subset of A**:
   - If \( B \subseteq A \), then \( P(A \cup B) = P(A) \).
   - Thus, \( P(A \cup B) = 0.3 \).

Comparing these results with the provided options, the correct match is:

- \( P(A \cup B) \) for mutually exclusive: 0.5
- \( P(A \cup B) \) for independent: 0.44
- \( P(A \cup B) \) for subset: 0.3

The option that matches these values is **E**.
