Okay, so I need to figure out which concept is reflected when new stores open around a large shopping mall. Let me look at the options and think through each one.

The question is about a situation where new stores are opening around a large shopping mall. So, what's happening here? Probably, the area is becoming more attractive for businesses because there's a lot of customer traffic. Maybe the success of the mall is attracting other complementary businesses nearby.

Let's go through the options:

A: Population density. That refers to the number of people in a given area. If the population is high, more stores might open, but the question is about a shopping mall area, so maybe it's more about the mall's influence than just the number of people.

B: Supply and demand. This is a basic economic principle where businesses provide goods based on consumer demand. If there's high demand, more stores open to meet it. But is that the specific concept here?

C: Movement bias. I'm not too sure about this one. I think it has more to do with how people's movements are influenced by certain factors, like distance or attractiveness of places. Not directly related to new stores opening.

D: Market saturation. This is when there's so much supply that the market can't absorb more. If new stores are opening, it doesn't seem like saturation yet; maybe the opposite.

E: Economic equality. That's about how wealth is distributed. Unlikely to be the concept here since the question is about business locations.

F: Distance decay. This refers to how the influence of a place decreases with distance. So, things closer are more influenced. Maybe, but how does that tie into new stores opening around the mall?

G: Complementarity. This is when two things go well together and enhance each other. Like how restaurants might open near a movie theater because people go out to eat before or after a movie. So, if a big mall is there, complementary stores (like coffee shops, clothing stores, etc.) would open nearby to capture the existing customer flow.

H: Consumer behavior. This is about how consumers make purchasing decisions. While it's related, it's more general. The question seems to point to a specific concept rather than general behavior.

Putting it together, when new stores open around a mall, they're likely doing so because their products or services complement the mall's offerings. They want to benefit from the mall's existing customer base. So, the concept is complementarity.

The opening of new stores around a large shopping mall is best explained by the concept of **complementarity**. This occurs when businesses offering complementary goods or services locate near each other to benefit from shared customer traffic. In this case, the mall attracts a high volume of customers, making the surrounding area an attractive location for new stores that can capitalize on this existing foot traffic.
