Okay, so I have this chemistry problem about oxidation-reduction reactions. Hmm, I need to figure out which reaction is most likely to occur based on the oxidation-reduction potentials. Alright, let's think this through.

The question gives me options from A to I. Each option is a chemical equation between a metal and a nitrate compound. I remember that for a reaction to happen spontaneously, the more reactive metal should displace the less reactive one from its compound. The way to determine this is by looking at the standard reduction potentials. The metal with a lower reduction potential is more likely to act as a reducing agent and get oxidized.

Wait, right, the standard reduction potentials are usually listed in tables. The higher the reduction potential, the more likely the substance is to be reduced. So, a metal with a lower reduction potential will tend to lose electrons (oxidize) and reduce another metal ion.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Fe(s) + 2 KNO3 → 2 K(s) + Fe(NO3)2. So Fe is reacting with KNO3. I think potassium has a very low reduction potential. Let me recall, K has a reduction potential of like -2.93 V, while Fe is about -0.44 V. Wait, no, wait. Wait, Fe^2+ + 2e^- → Fe(s) has a E° of around -0.44 V. K would be K^+ + e^- → K(s) at around -2.93 V. So for Fe to displace K, Fe would have to reduce K+ to K. But Fe's E° is higher than K's, so Fe can't reduce K+. So this reaction shouldn't happen. So option A is not likely.

Option B: Mg(s) + 2 KNO3 → 2 K(s) + Mg(NO3)2. Mg has a reduction potential of about -2.37 V. K is -2.93 V. Oh wait, Mg is higher than K. Wait, no. Wait, the standard reduction potential for Mg^2+ + 2e^- → Mg(s) is around -2.37 V. K is K^+ + e^- → K(s) is -2.93 V. So Mg's E° is higher than K's. So Mg can't reduce K+ because Mg is less willing to lose electrons than K+ is to gain them. So this reaction shouldn't happen either. So option B is unlikely.

Option C: Pb(s) + Ca(NO3)2 → Ca(s) + Pb(NO3)2. Let's check their potentials. Pb^2+ + 2e^- → Pb(s) is around -0.13 V. Ca^2+ + 2e^- → Ca(s) is about -2.87 V. So Pb has a higher E° than Ca. So Pb should be able to reduce Ca^2+ ions. Wait wait, wait. No, wait, in the reaction, Pb is the solid, so it's being oxidized to Pb^2+. Ca(NO3)2 is providing Ca^2+ as the oxidizing agent. So for the reaction to happen, Ca^2+ should be a good oxidizing agent, meaning it should have a higher E° than the Pb's. Wait, Pb's E° is -0.13 V, Ca's is -2.87 V. Oh, wait, no, the higher E° is more likely to be reduced. So Ca^2+ has a lower E°, so it's not as good at being reduced. Pb would have to reduce Ca^2+, but since Pb has a higher E°, it's less likely to do so. Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should think in terms of which metal is more reactive. Calcium is more reactive than lead. So Ca should displace Pb from its nitrate solution, but wait, in this case, the reaction is Pb displacing Ca. So would that happen? I don't think so because Ca is more reactive. So the reverse is more likely. So option C is not likely to occur.

Option D: Zn(s) + 2 AgNO3 → 2 Ag(s) + Zn(NO3)2. Zn has a reduction potential of about -0.76 V, Ag is +0.80 V. So Ag has a much higher E°. So in this reaction, Zn is oxidized to Zn^2+, and Ag+ is reduced to Ag. Since Zn has lower E° than Ag, Zn can reduce Ag+ ions. So this reaction should occur. I'll keep this as a candidate.

Option E: Pb(s) + 2 LiNO3 → 2 Li(s) + Pb(NO3)2. Let's see. Li has a very low E°, around -3.04 V for Li+/Li. Pb is about -0.13 V. So Li has a lower E°, meaning it's less likely to be reduced. So in this reaction, Pb is being oxidized to Pb^2+, and Li+ is being reduced to Li(s). But wait, Li has a very low E°, which means it doesn't tend to gain electrons (be reduced) as much. So Pb, having a higher E°, can't reduce Li+ because Li+ has lower E°. So this reaction probably won't happen. So option E is unlikely.

Option F: Zn(s) + 2 Cu(NO3) → 2 Cu(s) + Zn(NO3)2. Zn's E° is -0.76 V, Cu is +0.34 V. So Cu has higher E°, so Zn can reduce Cu^2+ to Cu. So this reaction should proceed. So both options D and F are possible, but the question is which is the most likely. Let's check the other options.

Option G: Al(s) + 2 Mg(NO3) → 2 Mg(s) + Al(NO3)3. Al has E° around -1.66 V, Mg is about -2.37 V. So Al has higher E° than Mg. So Al cannot reduce Mg^2+ because Mg^2+ has lower E°. So this reaction shouldn't happen.

Option H: Al(s) + 3 NaNO3 → 3 Na(s) + Al(NO3)3. Na's E° is around -2.71 V, Al is -1.66 V. So Al has higher E°, meaning Al can't reduce Na+ to Na(s). So reaction H is unlikely.

Option I: Ni(s) + 2 LiNO3 → 2 Li(s) + Ni(NO3)2. Ni's E° for Ni^2+ + 2e^- → Ni is around -0.25 V. Li is -3.04 V. So Ni has higher E°. So Ni can't reduce Li+ because Li's E° is lower. So reaction I is unlikely.

So the possible correct options are D and F. Both of their metals (Zn) are less noble than the metal in the nitrate solution (Ag and Cu). Wait, let's check their E°. For D: Zn is more reactive than Ag, so it should displace Ag. For F: Zn is more reactive than Cu, so it should displace Cu.

So both D and F are possible. Wait, but the question is which is most likely to occur. So perhaps the one with the biggest difference in E°. Let's calculate the cell potential. The cell potential is E°cathode minus E°anode. For a reaction to be spontaneous, the cell potential must be positive.

For option D: Zn is oxidized (anode), Ag+ is reduced (cathode). So E°cell = E°cathode (Ag) - E°anode (Zn) = 0.80 V - (-0.76 V) = 1.56 V. Positive, so spontaneous.

For option F: E°cell = E°cathode (Cu) - E°anode (Zn) = 0.34 V - (-0.76 V) = 1.10 V. Also positive, so reaction occurs.

So both are possible. But the question asks which is most likely to occur. Since both are possible, but the question gives only one correct answer. Looking back at the options, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, I should check whether I got the E° values correct. Let me think again.

Wait, for standard reduction potentials:

- Li+/Li: -3.04 V
- K+/K: -2.93 V
- Ca^2+/Ca: -2.87 V
- Na+/Na: -2.71 V
- Mg^2+/Mg: -2.37 V
- Al^3+/Al: -1.66 V
- Zn^2+/Zn: -0.76 V
- Fe^2+/Fe: -0.44 V
- Pb^2+/Pb: -0.13 V
- Cu^2+/Cu: +0.34 V
- Ag+/Ag: +0.80 V

So that's correct.

So for option D, Zn is more reactive than Ag, so it will displace Ag. Option D is correct. Option F is also correct. So perhaps the question has only one correct option, but I have to choose the best one. Wait, looking back at the options, let's make sure.

Wait, the options are A through I. So the correct answers are D and F. But in the given options, perhaps only one is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the activity series. The activity series arranges metals in order of reactivity. The more reactive metals can displace less reactive ones from their compounds.

In the activity series, the order is something like:

Li, K, Ba, Sr, Ca, Na, Mg, Al, Zn, Fe, Pb, Cu, Ag, Au.

So Zn is more reactive than Ag and Cu. So both D and F should be correct.

But looking back at the options, perhaps only one is correct. Did I make a mistake in calculating the E°cell?

Wait, for option D: Zn → Zn^2+ (oxidation) E°oxidation is -(-0.76) = +0.76. Ag+ → Ag, E°reduction is +0.80. So the overall E°cell is 0.80 + 0.76 = 1.56 V.

For option F: Zn → Zn^2+ (E°oxidation 0.76), Cu^2+ → Cu (E°reduction 0.34). So E°cell is 0.34 + 0.76 = 1.10 V.

So both are positive. So both reactions are spontaneous.

But the question is asking which is most likely. Since both are possible, perhaps the one with the higher E°cell is more likely. So D has higher E°cell than F. So D is more favorable.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the question expects all possible reactions or just any one. But since the options have only one correct answer, perhaps I should look again.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the options.

Wait, in option D, Zn is reacting with AgNO3 to produce Ag and Zn(NO3)2. That definitely happens because Zn is more reactive than Ag.

In option F, Zn reacts with Cu(NO3)2 to produce Cu and Zn(NO3)2. That also happens because Zn is more reactive than Cu.

So both D and F are correct, but the question expects only one correct option. Hmm, perhaps I need to check the options again.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

D: Zn(s) + 2 AgNO3 → 2 Ag(s) + Zn(NO3)2
F: Zn(s) + 2 Cu(NO3) → 2 Cu(s) + Zn(NO3)2

So both are correct. But the question is presented as a multiple-choice with only one correct answer. So perhaps the intended answer is D or F.

Wait, perhaps I should check the actual reaction feasibility. For example, sometimes, even if E° is positive, the reaction might not proceed due to other factors, but in this case, it's a straightforward single displacement reaction.

So given that, perhaps both D and F are correct. But the question expects me to choose one. So maybe the intended answer is F, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere. Let me check all other options again.

Looking back, option C: Pb and Ca(NO3)2. So Ca is more reactive than Pb, so Ca should displace Pb, but the equation is Pb displacing Ca, which is unlikely.

Option E: Pb with LiNO3. Li is less reactive, so Pb can't displace Li.

Options A and B: same, as K is more reactive than Fe and Mg.

Option G and H: Al and Mg/Na. Al is less reactive than Mg and Na, so can't displace them.

Option I: Ni and LiNO3. Ni is more reactive than Li? Wait, Li is more reactive than Ni. So Li would displace Ni, but the equation is Ni displacing Li, which isn't possible.

So other than D and F, the rest are not correct. So the correct answers are D and F. But the question expects one answer, so perhaps only one of them is an option. Wait, looking back, the options given are from A to I, and both D and F are present.

Hmm, perhaps the question is designed to have only one correct answer. Maybe I should reevaluate the E° values again.

Wait, wait, another thought: perhaps I should consider the actual standard reduction potentials for each half-reaction.

For example, in reaction D:

Anode (oxidation): Zn → Zn^2+ + 2e⁻ → E°oxidation is -E°(reduction) = +0.76 V.
Cathode (reduction): Ag+ + e⁻ → Ag → E°reduction is +0.80 V.
So overall E°cell = 0.80 + 0.76 = 1.56 V.

In reaction F:

Anode: Zn → Zn^2+ → E°oxidation = +0.76 V.
Cathode: Cu^2+ + 2e⁻ → Cu → E°reduction is +0.34 V.
E°cell = 0.34 + 0.76 = 1.10 V.

Both are positive, so both reactions are possible. Therefore, the correct answers would be both D and F. But the options only allow one choice, so perhaps the question expects the one with the highest E°cell. So D has higher E°cell, so it's more likely.

Alternatively, if the question is about the most likely to occur, perhaps the one with higher tendency. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps only one of them is correct, so I might have made a mistake.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction conditions. For example, sometimes nitrate ions can act as oxidizing agents in acidic conditions, but perhaps in neutral or basic, they might not. Wait, but the given reactions don't specify, so I think we can assume standard conditions.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. But given that, I think the correct options are D and F. However, the question expects only one answer, so perhaps I should look again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the E° values. Let me double-check.

Zn: Zn^2+ + 2e⁻ → Zn(s): E° = -0.76 V.

Ag+: Ag+ + e⁻ → Ag(s): E° = +0.80 V.

Cu^2+: Cu^2+ + 2e⁻ → Cu(s): E° = +0.34 V.

So yes, correct.

So both D and F are correct. But the options list them as separate choices. So perhaps the intended answer is D and F, but the question expects one. Alternatively, perhaps I need to choose all that apply, but the question is multiple-choice with single select.

Wait, the question asks which is most likely to occur, implying one option. So perhaps I should pick the one with the higher cell potential. So D has a higher E°cell than F, so it's more favorable. Therefore, the answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is F. Wait, no, D's E°cell is higher. So I think D is more likely than F.

But wait, in reality, both reactions are possible. But perhaps the question expects only one correct option, so perhaps the intended answer is D.

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps the correct answer is option D. Some sources indicate that Zn can displace Ag but not Cu? No, that's not correct. Zn can displace both Ag and Cu.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the question is looking for the most spontaneous reaction, which would be the one with the highest E°cell. So D has higher E°cell (1.56 V) than F (1.10 V), so D is more likely.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to choose option F, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The standard approach is to pick the reaction where the metal has a lower reduction potential than the metal in the solution. So in both D and F, Zn has lower E° than Ag and Cu, so both should occur. But since the question gives only one correct answer, perhaps the intended correct option is D.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options given in the question again. The options are A to I, with D and F as correct. But the user is expecting me to choose one.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in looking at the options. Let me check again.

Wait, the options are:

A: Fe and KNO3 → K and Fe(NO3)2
B: Mg and KNO3 → K and Mg(NO3)2
C: Pb and Ca(NO3)2 → Ca and Pb(NO3)2
D: Zn and AgNO3 → Ag and Zn(NO3)2
E: Pb and LiNO3 → Li and Pb(NO3)2
F: Zn and Cu(NO3) → Cu and Zn(NO3)2
G: Al and Mg(NO3) → Mg and Al(NO3)3
H: Al and NaNO3 → Na and Al(NO3)3
I: Ni and LiNO3 → Li and Ni(NO3)2

So, the correct options are D and F. But in the given options, only one can be correct. Since the question asks which is most likely, I'll go with D as the answer because it has a higher cell potential.

To determine which reaction is most likely to occur based on oxidation-reduction potentials, we analyze the standard reduction potentials (\(E^\circ\)) of the metals involved. A reaction is spontaneous if the metal being oxidized has a lower \(E^\circ\) (is more reactive) than the metal ion being reduced. The cell potential (\(E^\circ_{\
