Okay, so I've got this math problem here: I need to find the quotient of −40 divided by −8. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when you divide two negative numbers, the result is positive. Wait, is that right? Or is it the same as when you multiply? Because when you multiply two negatives, you get a positive. So maybe division works the same way.

Alright, so the problem is −40 ÷ (−8). Let me break it down. Dividing negatives... so if both are negative, the negatives cancel out, giving a positive result. So the sign of the answer should be positive.

Now, the actual division part. Let's ignore the signs for a second and just do 40 divided by 8. I know that 8 times 5 is 40 because 8 times 5 is 40. So 40 ÷ 8 equals 5. Since both original numbers were negative, the quotient should be positive 5.

Let me double-check. If I have −40 divided by −8, that's like asking, "How many times does −8 fit into −40?" Well, −8 times 5 is −40. But wait, no. Wait, no, because −8 times 5 is −40, but since both are negative, the result is positive. So yes, the answer should be 5.

Looking at the options, I see option H is 5. So that's the one I need to choose. I don't think any of the other options make sense here. Option D is −5, which would be if only one of the numbers was negative. So definitely, the correct answer is H.

The quotient of −40 ÷ (−8) is calculated by recognizing that dividing two negative numbers results in a positive number. Ignoring the signs, 40 ÷ 8 equals 5. Since both numbers are negative, the result is positive 5. 

Option H corresponds to 5, which is the correct answer.

Answer: H
