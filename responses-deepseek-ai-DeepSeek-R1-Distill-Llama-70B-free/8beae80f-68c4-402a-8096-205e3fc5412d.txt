Okay, so I've got this probability problem to solve, and I need to find the answer. Let's see what the question is about. 

The question is about a game where two players take turns tossing a fair coin. The first one to toss a head wins. The question is asking for the probability that the player who goes first (Player 1) wins the game.

Hmm, right. So each toss is independent, and the coin is fair, meaning the probability of getting heads (H) is 0.5 each time, and tails (T) is also 0.5. 

Let me think about how this game could play out. Player 1 goes first, then Player 2, then Player 1, and so on until someone gets a head.

I guess the possible scenarios where Player 1 wins are:

1. Player 1 gets a head on the first toss. That's straightforward. The probability of this happening is 1/2.

But if Player 1 gets a tail, then it's Player 2's turn. If Player 2 also gets a tail, then it's back to Player 1 again. So the game could go on for several rounds.

Wait, so the game could end on the first turn, second, third, etc. So maybe I should model this as an infinite series where each term represents Player 1 winning on their nth turn.

Let me break it down:

- The probability that Player 1 wins on their first toss: (1/2).

- If both Player 1 and Player 2 get tails in the first round, then the game effectively starts over. The probability of this happening is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4. Then, Player 1 again has the same probability to win from that point, which would be (1/4) multiplied by the original probability P. Wait, maybe I can set up an equation for this.

Let me denote P as the probability that Player 1 wins the game. Then, on their first turn, they have a 1/2 chance to win immediately. If they don't (which is also a 1/2 chance), then Player 2 gets a turn. Player 2 then has a 1/2 chance to win. If Player 2 also fails (another 1/2), then it's back to Player 1, and the situation is the same as the beginning.

So mathematically, this can be written as:

P = probability Player 1 wins on first toss + probability both get tails and then Player 1 wins the subsequent game.

So:

P = (1/2) + (1/2)*(1/2)*P

Wait, let me re-express that. The first term is Player 1 winning on the first try. The second scenario is both getting tails (probability 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4), and then Player 1's probability from that point is P again.

So the equation becomes P = (1/2) + (1/4)*P.

Wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. If both get tails, the game resets, so the probability of Player 1 winning from that point is P. So yes, that part is correct.

So now I can solve for P. Let's rearrange the equation:

P = 1/2 + (1/4) P

Subtract (1/4)P from both sides:

P - (1/4)P = 1/2

(3/4)P = 1/2

Multiply both sides by (4/3):

P = (1/2) * (4/3) = 2/3

Wait, that gives me P = 2/3. Looking at the answer options, option H is 2/3. So is that the correct answer?

Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as an infinite series. The probability that Player 1 wins on the first toss is 1/2. The probability that Player 1 wins on the third toss (meaning both Player 1 and 2 got tails in the first two tosses, then Player 1 gets a head) is (1/2)^3 = 1/8. Similarly, the probability that Player 1 wins on the fifth toss is (1/2)^5 = 1/32, and so on.

So the total probability P would be the sum of this infinite geometric series where each term is (1/2)^(2n-1) for n starting from 1 to infinity. Let's write that as:

P = (1/2) + (1/2)^3 + (1/2)^5 + (1/2)^7 + ... 

This is a geometric series with first term a = 1/2 and common ratio r = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

The sum of an infinite geometric series is a/(1 - r). So plugging in:

P = (1/2) / (1 - 1/4) = (1/2) / (3/4) = (1/2) * (4/3) = 2/3.

Same result as before. So that makes me more confident that the correct answer is 2/3, which is option H.

Another way to think about it is considering the turns. Each round after the first can be seen as a "cycle" where if both get tails, the game continues. So the probability that the game continues after each full round (both players tossing tails) is (1/2)*(1/2) = 1/4. So the initial chance is 1/2 for Player 1. If not, the game starts over, giving another 1/4 chance to be back in the same situation. So the total probability is 1/2 + (1/4)*1/2 + (1/4)^2 *1/2 + ... which again sums to 2/3.

So I'm pretty confident the answer is H: 2/3.

To determine the probability that the player who makes the first toss (Player 1) wins the game, we analyze the possible outcomes of the game. The game involves two players taking turns tossing a fair coin, and the first player to toss a head wins. The probability of getting heads (H) or tails (T) on any toss is 0.5.

### Key Scenarios:
1. **Player 1 wins on the first toss**: This happens with probability \( \frac{1}{2} \).
2. **Both players get tails on their first tosses**: The probability of this is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \). If this happens, the game effectively restarts, and Player 1's probability of winning from this point remains the same, denoted as \( P \).

### Setting Up the Equation:
Let \( P \) represent the probability that Player 1 wins the game. The total probability can be expressed as:
\[
P = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4}P
\]
This equation accounts for:
- The probability that Player 1 wins immediately on the first toss (\( \frac{1}{2} \)).
- The probability that both players get tails (\( \frac{1}{4} \)) and then Player 1 wins from that point (\( P \)).

### Solving for \( P \):
Rearranging the equation:
\[
P - \frac{1}{4}P = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\frac{3}{4}P = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
P = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{4}{3} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

### Verification Using Infinite Series:
The probability that Player 1 wins can also be modeled as an infinite geometric series. The probability of Player 1 winning on their \( n \)-th turn is \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2n-1} \). The series is:
\[
P = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{32} + \dots
\]
This is a geometric series with the first term \( a = \frac{1}{2} \) and common ratio \( r = \frac{1}{4} \). The sum of the series is:
\[
P = \frac{a}{1 - r} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{1 - \frac{1}{4}} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

### Conclusion:
The probability that the player who makes the first toss wins the game is \( \frac{2}{3} \), which corresponds to option **H**.
