Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating an employee's total earnings. Hmm, let me read it again. The employee worked 43 hours and earns $3.00 per hour. Oh wait, there's this thing about time and a half for more than 40 hours a week. Alright, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that in many jobs, if you work more than 40 hours in a week, the extra hours are paid at time and a half. That means 1.5 times the regular pay. So, I should split the hours into regular and overtime.

So, the employee worked 43 hours. The first 40 are regular hours, and the remaining 3 are overtime. Let me jot that down. Regular hours: 40, Overtime hours: 3.

Now, the regular pay is $3.00 per hour. So for 40 hours, that would be 40 * 3. Let me calculate that: 40 * 3 is 120. So regular pay is $120.

For the overtime, it's time and a half, which is 1.5 times the regular rate. So the overtime rate is 3 * 1.5. Let me compute that: 3 * 1.5 is 4.5. So the overtime rate is $4.50 per hour.

The employee worked 3 hours overtime. So 3 * 4.5. Let me calculate that: 3 * 4.5 is 13.5. So the overtime pay is $13.50.

Now, to find the total earnings, I add the regular pay and the overtime pay. So 120 + 13.5 equals 133.5. So the total should be $133.50.

Looking at the options, option A is $133.50. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check. Sometimes I might make a mistake in calculations. Let's recalculate.

Regular pay: 40 hours at $3. 40 *3=120. Overtime: 3 hours. Overtime rate is 3 *1.5=4.5. 3 *4.5=13.5. Total is 120 +13.5=133.5. Yep, that's correct. So option A is right.

The employee worked a total of 43 hours, with the first 40 hours classified as regular hours and the remaining 3 hours as overtime. The regular pay rate is $3.00 per hour, while the overtime rate is time and a half, which is $4.50 per hour (1.5 × $3.00). 

Calculating the earnings:
- Regular pay: 40 hours × $3.00/hour = $120.00
- Overtime pay: 3 hours × $4.50/hour = $13.50
- Total earnings: $120.00 + $13.50 = $133.50

Thus, the total earnings of the employee are **$133.50**, which corresponds to option A.
