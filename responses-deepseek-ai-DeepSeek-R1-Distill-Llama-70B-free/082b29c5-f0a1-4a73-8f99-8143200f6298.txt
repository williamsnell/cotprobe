Okay, so I've got this gas density problem here, and I need to find out the volume that 10 grams of the gas will occupy under standard conditions. Hmm, let me break this down.

Alright, the given data: the density is 0.222 g/l at 20.0°C and 800 torr. And I need to find the volume when 10.0 g is under standard conditions. Wait, standard conditions are 0°C and 1 atm, right? Oh wait, no, wait. I remember that standard temperature and pressure (STP) is 0°C (which is 273 K) and 1 atm pressure. But sometimes people use 25°C and 1 atm as standard, but I think for gas laws, it's usually 0°C and 1 atm.

So first, I think I should probably find the molar mass of the gas because knowing that will help in calculations. Because density relates to molar mass and conditions.

Wait, density (d) is mass/volume, right? And for gases, the density can be related to the molar mass using the ideal gas law. Oh right, the formula I remember is d = (PM)/(RT), where P is pressure, M is molar mass, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature in Kelvin.

So given that, I can rearrange the formula to solve for M. So M = (dRT)/P.

But wait, let's check the units. The density is given in g/l. R is usually in L·atm/(mol·K). Pressure is in torr, so I need to convert that to atm because R is in terms of atm.

So 800 torr is how many atm? Since 1 atm is 760 torr, so 800 / 760 = approximately 1.0526 atm.

The temperature is 20°C, which is 293 K (since 273 + 20 = 293).

R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). So putting it all together:

M = (d * R * T) / P.

Plugging in the numbers:

d = 0.222 g/l. Wait, wait! Oh wait, no. Because in the formula, d is in g/L. Or does it matter? Let me think. The formula d=PM/(RT) gives d in g/L when M is in g/mol, R in L·atm/(mol·K), P in atm, T in K.

Wait, let me make sure. Let me see the units:

(P in atm) * (M in g/mol) divided by (R in L·atm/(mol·K)) * (T in K) gives (atm * g/mol) / (L·atm/(mol·K) * K) ) → The atm cancels, K cancels, mol cancels, leaving g/L. Yes, correct. So the formula is correct.

So M = (d * R * T) / P.

So let's compute this step by step.

d = 0.222 g/L.

R = 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K.

T = 293 K.

P = 800 torr = 800/760 atm = approx 1.0526 atm.

So M = (0.222 * 0.0821 * 293) / 1.0526.

Let me compute numerator first: 0.222 * 0.0821 = let's see: 0.222 * 0.08 is 0.01776, and 0.222 * 0.0021 is about 0.0004662. So total is approximately 0.018226.

Wait, actually, let me compute more accurately:

0.222 * 0.0821 = ?

Breaking it down:

0.2 * 0.0821 = 0.01642.

0.02 * 0.0821 = 0.001642.

0.002 * 0.0821 = 0.0001642.

Adding them: 0.01642 + 0.001642 = 0.018062, plus 0.0001642 → 0.0182262.

So 0.0182262 * 293 = ?

Let me compute that:

0.0182262 * 293.

Let me compute 0.0182262 * 300 first, which is about 5.46786. But since it's 293, that's 300-7. So 5.46786 - (0.0182262 *7).

0.0182262 *7 = 0.1275834.

So 5.46786 - 0.1275834 ≈ 5.3402766.

So numerator is about 5.3403 g·L·atm/(mol).

Wait, no, I think I missed a step. Wait, M is (d*R*T)/P. So the numerator is d*R*T, which we've calculated as approximately 5.3403.

Then divide by P, which is 1.0526 atm.

So M ≈ 5.3403 / 1.0526 ≈ let's see.

1.0526 times 5 is 5.263. So 5.3403 -5.263 is 0.0773.

So 0.0773 / 1.0526 ≈ approximately 0.0734.

So M≈5 + 0.0734≈5.0734 g/mol. Wait, that can't be right. Because that's a really low molar mass. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, maybe I messed up the initial calculation steps. Let me try using a calculator approach more accurately.

Compute M:

d = 0.222 g/L.

R = 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K.

T = 293 K.

P = 800 torr = 800 /760 = 1.0526315789 atm.

So M = (0.222 * 0.0821 * 293) / 1.0526315789.

Compute numerator: 0.222 * 0.0821 = 0.0182262.

0.0182262 * 293 = let's compute that.

0.0182262 * 200 = 3.64524.

0.0182262 * 93 = ?

Compute 0.0182262 *90=1.640346.

0.0182262 *3=0.0546786.

So 1.640346 + 0.0546786=1.6950246.

So 3.64524 +1.6950246 = 5.3402646 g·L·atm/(mol).

Divide by 1.0526315789 atm.

So 5.3402646 / 1.0526315789 = let me compute that.

1.0526315789 times 5 is 5.263157894.

So 5.3402646 -5.263157894 = 0.077106706.

Now, 0.077106706 /1.0526315789 = approx 0.0732.

So M ≈5.0732 g/mol. Wait, that's about 5.07 g/mol. But what gas has a molar mass around 5 g/mol? Helium is about 4, so maybe it's a typo? Or perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should recheck the calculations with more precise numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use exact calculation:

Let me compute 0.222 * 0.0821 * 293 / (800/760).

Wait, 800/760 is 1.0526315789.

Let me compute each step exactly.

Compute numerator: 0.222 * 0.0821 = 0.0182262.

Multiply by 293: 0.0182262 *293.

Let me compute 0.0182262 *293:

293 = 200 +90 +3.

0.0182262 * 200 = 3.64524.

0.0182262 *90 = 1.640346.

0.0182262 *3 = 0.0546786.

Adding them: 3.64524 +1.640346 =5.285586; +0.0546786 =5.3402646.

Now, denominator is 800/760 = 1.0526315789.

So 5.3402646 /1.0526315789.

Let me compute this division: 5.3402646 ÷ 1.0526315789.

Let me compute 1.0526315789 * 5 =5.263157894.

Subtract this from 5.3402646: 5.3402646-5.263157894=0.077106706.

Now, 0.077106706 ÷ 1.0526315789.

Compute 1.0526315789 × 0.0732 ≈ 0.077.

Because 1.0526315789 × 0.07 = 0.07368522.

Wait, 0.07 *1.0526315789=0.0736852.

So 0.0736852 is less than 0.0771067.

The difference is 0.0771067 -0.0736852=0.0034215.

So 0.0034215 /1.0526315789 ≈0.00325.

So total M≈0.07 +0.00325=0.07325. So M≈5 +0.07325=5.07325 g/mol.

Wait, so the molar mass is approximately 5.07 g/mol. Hmm, that's very low. So what gas is that? Helium is 4, so maybe it's a typo? Or perhaps I made a mistake in calculations. Let me check the formula again.

Wait, another approach: Maybe I should use the ideal gas law to find moles first, then find volume under standard conditions.

Wait, let me think again. The problem is asking for the volume that 10 grams of the gas will occupy under standard conditions (0°C, 1 atm). So perhaps I can find the number of moles in 10 grams, then use ideal gas law at STP to find the volume.

So first, find moles using molar mass. Because moles = mass/molar mass.

But to find molar mass, I can use the initial conditions.

So given density d = 0.222 g/L at 20°C (293 K) and 800 torr.

So using PV = nRT.

But n is in moles. Alternatively, density d is mass/volume, so mass = d * V. So n = (d * V)/M.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The density formula for a gas is d = PM/(RT), as I did earlier. So I can compute M as (dRT)/P.

Once I have M, then moles = 10 g / M.

Then, using the ideal gas law at STP (273 K, 1 atm), compute V = nRT/P.

Wait, let me try that.

So compute M first.

So M = (d R T) / P.

d=0.222 g/L.

R=0.0821 L·atm/mol·K.

T=293 K.

P=800 torr = 1.0526 atm.

So M = (0.222)(0.0821)(293) / 1.0526.

Compute numerator: 0.222 * 0.0821 = 0.0182262. 0.0182262 * 293 =5.34026.

Divide by 1.0526: 5.34026 /1.0526≈5.073 g/mol.

So M≈5.073 g/mol.

So moles n = 10.0 g / 5.073 g/mol ≈1.971 mol.

Now, under standard conditions (0°C=273 K, 1 atm), find volume V.

Using PV =nRT.

V = (nRT)/P.

n=1.971.

R=0.0821.

T=273.

P=1 atm.

So V = (1.971 * 0.0821 * 273) /1.

Compute that:

1.971 *0.0821 ≈ 0.1618.

0.1618 *273 ≈44.32 liters.

Hmm, but looking at the options, option H is 44.15 l, which is close. But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me compute more accurately.

n =10 /5.073 ≈1.971.

Compute nRT: 1.971 * 0.0821 * 273.

Compute 1.971 *0.0821 first.

1.971 *0.08=0.15768.

1.971 *0.0021=0.0041411.

Total: 0.15768 +0.0041411≈0.161821.

Multiply by 273: 0.161821 *273.

Compute 0.161821 *200 =32.3642.

0.161821 *73 = let's compute 0.161821*70=11.32747; 0.161821*3=0.485463. So total 11.32747+0.485463=11.81293.

Add to 32.3642: 32.3642 +11.81293=44.1771 liters.

So approximately 44.18 liters.

Looking at the options, option H is 44.15 l, which is very close. So the correct answer would be H.

But wait, perhaps I should double-check the calculations for M because a molar mass of ≈5.07 g/mol seems very low, but perhaps it's correct.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute the molar mass more accurately.

Compute M = (0.222 g/L) * (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K) * (293 K) / (800/760 atm).

So M= (0.222 *0.0821 *293 *760)/(800).

Let me compute numerator: 0.222 *0.0821=0.0182262.

0.0182262 *293=5.3402646.

5.3402646 *760= let's compute 5 *760=3800, 0.3402646*760≈258.6, so total≈4058.6.

Denominator:800.

So M=4058.6 /800 =5.07325 g/mol.

Yes, same as before. So n=10/5.07325≈1.9714 mol.

Then V= nRT/P= (1.9714 *0.0821 *273)/1.

Compute 1.9714 *0.0821= let's compute 2 *0.0821=0.1642; subtract 0.0286 *0.0821.

Wait, perhaps better to compute accurately:

1.9714 *0.0821.

1 *0.0821=0.0821.

0.9 *0.0821=0.07389.

0.07 *0.0821=0.005747.

0.0014 *0.0821=0.00011494.

Adding them: 0.0821 +0.07389=0.15599 +0.005747=0.161737 +0.00011494≈0.16185194.

Multiply by 273: 0.16185194 *273.

Compute 0.16185194 *200=32.370388.

0.16185194 *73: Let's compute 0.16185194 *70=11.329736 and 0.16185194 *3=0.4855558. So total 11.329736 +0.4855558=11.8152918.

So total V=32.370388 +11.8152918≈44.18568 liters.

So V≈44.186 liters. The closest option is H:44.15 l. So that's the answer.

But wait, perhaps I should check if I'm using the correct standard conditions. Because sometimes standard conditions are considered as 25°C and 1 atm, but I think in this problem, it's 0°C and 1 atm. Let me confirm.

Yes, the question says "standard conditions," which are 0°C and 1 atm.

So I think the correct answer is H:44.15 l.
</think>

To determine the volume of 10.0 g of the gas under standard conditions (0°C and 1 atm), we start by calculating the molar mass of the gas using the given density, pressure, and temperature. The relationship between density and molar mass is given by:

\[
d = \frac{PM}{RT}
\]

Rearranging for \(M\):

\[
M = \frac{dRT}{P}
\]

Where:
- \(d = 0.222 \, \text{g/L}\),
- \(R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)}\),
- \(T = 20.0^\circ \text{C} = 293 \, \text{K}\),
- \(P = 800 \, \text{torr} = \frac{800}{760} \, \text{atm} \approx 1.0526 \, \text{atm}\).

Substituting the values:

\[
M = \frac{(0.222)(0.0821)(293)}{1.0526}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
0.222 \times 0.0821 = 0.0182262
\]
\[
0.0182262 \times 293 = 5.3402646
\]

Now divide by \(1.0526\):

\[
M = \frac{5.3402646}{1.0526} \approx 5.073 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

The molar mass of the gas is approximately \(5.073 \, \text{g/mol}\).

Next, calculate the number of moles of gas in 10.0 g:

\[
n = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{molar mass}} = \frac{10.0}{5.073} \approx 1.971 \, \text{mol}
\]

Under standard conditions (\(T = 0^\circ \text{C} = 273 \, \text{K}\), \(P = 1 \, \text{atm}\)), the volume of the gas can be calculated using the ideal gas law:

\[
V = \frac{nRT}{P}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
V = \frac{(1.971)(0.0821)(273)}{1}
\]

First, calculate \(nRT\):
