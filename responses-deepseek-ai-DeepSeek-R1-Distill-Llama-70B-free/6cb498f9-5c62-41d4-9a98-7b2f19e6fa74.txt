Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the French Revolution, specifically focusing on Robespierre and the changes he instituted during the radical phase. The question is asking which of these changes was least beneficial to the defense of France. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what each of the options refers to and how they relate to the defense of France. The options are labeled A through J, each describing a different policy or action taken by Robespierre. I remember that Robespierre was a leading figure during the Reign of Terror, which was a period marked by extreme measures to protect the revolution from its enemies, both within and outside France.

Let me go through each option one by one and think about their impact on France's defense.

Option A: Encouraging the spread of revolutionary ideas abroad. I think this might refer to the idea of exporting the revolution, which could have both positive and negative effects. On one hand, spreading revolutionary ideas could create allies or at least weaken neighboring countries by causing internal unrest. On the other hand, it might provoke other European powers to oppose France more strongly, which could be a defensive issue. But I'm not sure how directly this affects France's defense; maybe it's more about foreign policy than direct defense.

Option B: Implementing the Reign of Terror. The Reign of Terror was a period where the government executed thousands of people accused of being counter-revolutionaries. While this might have unified support for the revolution by eliminating opposition, it also led to internal instability and fear. From a defense standpoint, a stable and united population is better for defense, but the Terror might have caused resentment and division, which could be detrimental.

Option C: Expelling foreign diplomats. This seems like a direct defensive measure. Foreign diplomats could be spies or have other hostile intentions. Expelling them would reduce the risk of espionage and internal interference, which is beneficial for national security and defense.

Option D: Pursuing a policy of de-Christianization. This was part of the broader effort to remove the influence of the church, which was seen as counter-revolutionary. However, this policy was highly unpopular among the devoutly Catholic population. Widespread discontent could lead to internal uprisings, which would weaken France's ability to defend itself effectively because resources would be diverted to quell domestic unrest.

Option E: Fixing prices and wages. Economic stability is crucial for a country at war. If prices are too high or wages too low, it can lead to discontent and economic collapse. Fixing them might help control inflation and ensure that resources are allocated properly, supporting the war effort and defense.

Option F: Abolishing slavery in French colonies. While morally progressive, the immediate impact on defense might be mixed. It could lead to uprisings in colonies if not handled well, but it also might gain support from abolished slaves who could support the revolution. However, I'm not sure how directly this affects metropolitan France's defense.

Option G: Promoting soldiers based upon their merits. This is a positive change. Merit-based promotion increases efficiency and competence in the military. Capable leaders would make better strategic decisions, which is beneficial for defense.

Option H: Enforcing strict rationing of food supplies. Rationing helps ensure that both the military and civilians have enough food, preventing starvation and unrest. This supports the war effort by maintaining morale and health, which is crucial for defense.

Option I: Instituting a new Republican Calendar. This was part of the cultural revolution, changing traditions and symbols. While it boosts revolutionary fervor, it's more about internal propaganda and cultural change. I'm not sure it directly impacts military defense, but it might affect morale. However, it's probably not as directly impactful as other measures.

Option J: The conscription of huge armies. The levée en masse, which was the mass conscription of soldiers, greatly increased France's military numbers. This was crucial for defending against external threats and expanding the revolution, so it's definitely beneficial for defense.

Now, the question is which of these was least beneficial. So I'm looking for the option that either hindered defense or didn't contribute much.

Option B, the Reign of Terror, while intended to root out enemies, led to a lot of internal violence and fear. It probably created more enemies domestically and internationally, making France less stable and possibly more vulnerable in the long run. However, it's arguable whether it was beneficial or not because it did eliminate some threats.

Option D, de-Christianization, caused significant internal dissent. If a large part of the population is against the government's policies, it could lead to rebellions, which would require military resources to suppress, weakening defense elsewhere. So this seems like it would be bad for defense.

Option A, spreading revolutionary ideas, might have provoked other European nations to declare war on France, which could be seen as detrimental to defense because it increased the number of enemies. But it also might have created allies or distracted enemies, so the impact isn't clear.

Option I, the new calendar, seems more about internal propaganda and less about defense. It's probably not harmful, but also not directly helpful. But the question is about being least beneficial, so if other options are worse, this might not be the answer.

So comparing the options, I think D (de-Christianization) and B (Reign of Terror) are strong candidates. The Reign of Terror was about internal control through fear, which might have unified some support but caused a lot of internal resentment. De-Christianization, on the other hand, alienated a significant portion of the population, leading to uprisings and internal conflicts, which would divert resources from defense.

Wait, but the question is about which was least beneficial to the defense. So which of these had a more negative impact on defense.

The Reign of Terror was a way to eliminate threats, which might have prevented internal subversion, thus aiding defense. But it's a double-edged sword because it also caused fear and instability, which could be bad.

De-Christianization likely led to more internal resistance, such as the revolt in the Vendée, which would require military action to suppress, thus weakening France's ability to defend against external enemies.

So perhaps D is the correct answer because it directly caused internal uprisings that diverted military resources, making defense harder.

Another option is B, the Reign of Terror, which while brutal, might have been seen as necessary to maintain control and prevent counter-revolution, thus aiding defense. However, it's also possible that the terror was more harmful than helpful because it created a climate of fear that could undermine morale and unity.

But I'm trying to think which one is least beneficial. If the Reign of Terror helped maintain control, then perhaps it was beneficial. But de-Christianization led to active rebellion, which is worse for defense.

Alternatively, I'm not sure. Let me think again.

The question is about which change was least beneficial. So which action had the least positive impact or the most negative on defense.

Option D: De-Christianization caused internal unrest and rebellion, which required military suppression, thus weakening the overall defense as resources were divided.

Option B: The Reign of Terror might have made the population submissive but also created a lot of enemies and fear, which could lead to less willing soldiers or support for the military.

So perhaps both B and D are negative, but which is the least beneficial.

Alternatively, looking for the option that doesn't contribute to defense.

Wait, another approach: the question is about the radical phase changes by Robespierre and which was least beneficial to defense. So I should think about which actions were taken during that time and their impact.

De-Christianization was part of the radical phase, and it led to internal opposition. The other policies like price fixing, conscription, promoting merit, rationing, etc., were more directly aimed at supporting the military and the economy, thus aiding defense.

Therefore, the least beneficial would be the one that didn't support defense and instead caused problems. So D and B are the main contenders.

But I think de-Christianization was more about internal cultural changes and caused significant internal resistance, which would be bad for defense. So perhaps D is the answer.

Alternatively, another thought: during the radical phase, the Reign of Terror was used to eliminate enemies, which might have prevented internal threats, thus aiding defense. But it's a matter of perspective whether the benefits outweigh the costs.

I think I'm leaning towards D being the correct answer because de-Christianization led to internal uprisings that directly weakened France's defense by dividing its forces.

To determine which change instituted by Robespierre during the radical phase of the French Revolution was least beneficial to the defense of France, it is essential to analyze the impact of each option on national security and military effectiveness.

- **Option A**: Encouraging the spread of revolutionary ideas abroad could provoke foreign powers, potentially increasing opposition to France. However, it might also create allies or destabilize enemy nations, making its impact on defense ambiguous.

- **Option B**: Implementing the Reign of Terror eliminated internal opposition but also caused widespread fear, instability, and resentment. While it may have unified support for the revolution, the internal division and discontent it generated could undermine defense.

- **Option C**: Expelling foreign diplomats reduced the risk of espionage and internal interference, directly benefiting national security and defense.

- **Option D**: Pursuing de-Christianization alienated a significant portion of the population, leading to internal uprisings like the Vendée revolt. This diverted military resources to suppress domestic unrest, weakening France's ability to defend against external threats.

- **Option E**: Fixing prices and wages helped stabilize the economy, ensuring resources were allocated effectively to support the war effort and defense.

- **Option F**: Abolishing slavery in French colonies, while morally progressive, had limited direct impact on the defense of metropolitan France.

- **Option G**: Promoting soldiers based on merit improved military efficiency and competence, directly benefiting defense.

- **Option H**: Enforcing strict rationing of food supplies maintained morale and health, supporting the war effort.

- **Option I**: Instituting a new Republican Calendar was more about cultural propaganda and had little direct impact on defense.

- **Option J**: The conscription of huge armies strengthened France's military capabilities, crucial for defending against external threats.

Among these, **Option D: Pursuing a policy of de-Christianization** stands out as the least beneficial to defense. It caused significant internal dissent and rebellion, diverting military resources and weakening France's ability to defend itself effectively. While the Reign of Terror (Option B) was also harmful, it was intended to root out counter-revolutionaries and maintain control, which could be seen as having some defensive value. In contrast, de-Christianization had no such mitigating benefits and directly undermined defense by creating internal instability.

Answer: D
