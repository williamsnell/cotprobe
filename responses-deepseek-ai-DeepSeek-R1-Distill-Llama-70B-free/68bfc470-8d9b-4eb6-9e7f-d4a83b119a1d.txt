Okay, so I have this problem to solve about the weight of a test tube. Hmm, let's see. The question says that some solid calcium oxide (CaO) in a test tube absorbs water vapor and changes completely into calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)₂). The initial weight of both the CaO and the test tube together is 10.860 grams, and eventually, after the CaO has reacted, the weight goes up to 11.149 grams. I need to find out what the weight of just the test tube is.

Alright, I'll start by breaking this down. I think I should consider the chemical reaction involved here. CaO reacting with water vapor (H₂O) to form Ca(OH)₂. Let me write that reaction out:

CaO (s) + H₂O (g) → Ca(OH)₂ (s)

So, the CaO picks up water from the surroundings, and the product is Ca(OH)₂. Since it's a solid changing to another solid, the mass increases because H₂O is added. That makes sense because the initial total weight is lower than the final.

Wait, but the initial weight includes the test tube and CaO, and the final weight includes the test tube and Ca(OH)₂. So the difference in these weights should be the mass of the water absorbed, right?

Let me think. The initial mass is (CaO + test tube) = 10.860 g. The final mass is (Ca(OH)₂ + test tube) = 11.149 g. So the increase in mass is 11.149 - 10.860 = 0.289 grams. That 0.289 grams must be the mass of the water that was absorbed by the CaO.

But wait, in the reaction, each mole of CaO reacts with one mole of H₂O. So the mass of H₂O added is equal to the mass of H₂O that's part of the Ca(OH)₂. So maybe I can find the mass of CaO from this.

Let me think about the molar masses. CaO has a molar mass of 40 (Ca) + 16 (O) = 56 g/mol. H₂O is 2(1) + 16 = 18 g/mol. So when CaO reacts with H₂O, the product Ca(OH)₂ has a molar mass of 40 + 2*(16+1) = 40 + 34 = 74 g/mol.

The mass of CaO that reacted plus the mass of H₂O is the mass of Ca(OH)₂. So, if the mass of H₂O is 0.289 g, then:

Let me denote the mass of CaO as m. Then, the mass of Ca(OH)₂ is m + 0.289 g.

But wait, from the chemical equation, for each mole of CaO, one mole of Ca(OH)₂ is formed. So the molar ratio is 1:1. So the mass increase from CaO to Ca(OH)₂ is (74 - 56) = 18 g per mole of CaO. Wait, but that's per mole. Alternatively, the mass of water added is 18 g per mole of CaO.

Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of moles. Let me calculate the moles of H₂O absorbed. The mass of H₂O is 0.289 g. Molar mass of H₂O is 18 g/mol. So moles H₂O = 0.289 / 18 ≈ 0.0161 mol.

Since the mole ratio of CaO to H₂O is 1:1, that means moles of CaO are also 0.0161 mol. Then, the mass of CaO is moles * molar mass = 0.0161 * 56 ≈ 0.901 g.

So the initial mass of CaO is about 0.901 grams. Since the initial total weight (CaO + test tube) is 10.860 g, the test tube's weight would be 10.860 - 0.901 ≈ 9.959 g. Looking at the options, I see option I is 9.960 g. That's very close, so probably the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Did I do everything correctly?

Mass of H₂O: 0.289 g. Molar mass H₂O is 18, so moles = 0.289 /18 = approx 0.0160556 mol.

Molar mass of CaO is 56 g/mol, so mass of CaO = 0.0160556 *56 = 0.90031 grams. So about 0.9003 g.

Then initial weight CaO + tube = 10.860. So tube = 10.860 - 0.9003 = 9.9597 grams, which is 9.960 g. So option I.

Wait, but another approach: the mass of the product Ca(OH)₂ is the initial CaO plus the mass of H₂O. So mass of Ca(OH)₂ is m + 0.289, where m is the mass of CaO. Also, the mass of Ca(OH)₂ is equal to m + 0.289.

But from the reaction, CaO (56 g/mol) becomes Ca(OH)₂ (74 g/mol), so the mass gain per mole is 18 grams. So the mass of CaO is m, and the mass of Ca(OH)₂ is m + 18*(m/56), because each mole of CaO adds 18g. Wait, perhaps that's getting more complicated.

Alternatively, the mass of Ca(OH)₂ is m + (mass of H₂O) = m + 0.289 g. Also, since each mole of CaO produces a mole of Ca(OH)₂, the mass of Ca(OH)₂ is m*(74/56), because 74 is the molar mass of Ca(OH)₂ and 56 is CaO.

So:

m*(74/56) = m + 0.289

Let me solve for m.

Multiply both sides by 56 to eliminate denominators:

74 m = 56 m + 0.289 *56

74m -56m = 0.289 *56
18m = 16.104
m = 16.104 /18 = 0.8947 grams.

Wait, that's different from before. So which one is correct?

Wait, this approach gives m ≈ 0.8947 g. Then the test tube weight would be 10.860 - 0.8947 = 9.9653 g, which is approximately 9.965 g. But looking back, option I is 9.960, which is close. Maybe I made a mistake in this approach.

Wait, let me re-calculate. If m*(74/56) = m + 0.289.

Compute 74/56 = 1.3214.

So 1.3214 m = m + 0.289

Subtract m: 0.3214 m = 0.289

m = 0.289 / 0.3214 ≈ 0.899 grams.

So about 0.899 grams. Then test tube is 10.860 - 0.899 = 9.961 grams, which is ~9.961. So again, near 9.960 g, option I.

Wait, but earlier I had 0.9003 grams from the first method, leading to 9.9597 grams. So that's consistent with option I.

So perhaps the correct answer is I: 9.960 g.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused why the two methods give slightly different results, but I think it's because the exact mass difference is 0.289 grams. Let me compute that exactly.

The initial weight: 10.860 g.

Final weight: 11.149 g.

Difference is 11.149 -10.860 = 0.289 grams exactly.

So the mass of H2O absorbed is 0.289 g.

Number of moles of H2O: 0.289 / 18.01528 ≈ let's compute accurately.

18.01528 g/mol. 0.289 / 18.01528 ≈ 0.016037 mol.

Molar mass of CaO is 56.0774 g/mol. So mass of CaO is 0.016037 *56.0774 ≈ 0.016037 *56.0774.

Let me compute that:

0.016037 *56 = 0.8972, and 0.016037 *0.0774 ≈ approx 0.00124.

Total ≈ 0.8972 + 0.00124 = 0.89844 grams.

So mass of CaO is approximately 0.8984 grams.

So initial total weight (CaO + test tube) is 10.860 g. So test tube is 10.860 - 0.8984 = 9.9616 grams. That's about 9.9616 grams, which is 9.962 g, but the option I is 9.960 g. So perhaps the exact answer rounds to 9.960 g.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Another approach: The test tube's mass is constant. The mass of CaO goes to Ca(OH)₂, which includes the mass of CaO plus water.

The mass increase is 0.289 g, which is the mass of H₂O added.

But according to the reaction, each mole of CaO reacts with one mole of H₂O, so the mass of H₂O added is 0.289 g.

So the moles of H₂O is 0.289 / 18.015 = approximately 0.01603 mol.

Since the molar ratio is 1:1, moles of CaO is also 0.01603 mol.

Mass of CaO is 0.01603 * 56.0774 ≈ 0.8984 grams.

So test tube mass is 10.860 - 0.8984 = 9.9616 grams, which is about 9.962 grams.

Looking at the options, option I is 9.960, which is the closest. So I think that's the correct choice.

But wait, another thought: maybe the test tube's mass is the final mass minus the mass of Ca(OH)₂. Let me see.

Final mass is test tube + Ca(OH)₂ = 11.149 g.

Mass of Ca(OH)₂ is mass of CaO + mass of H₂O, which is 0.8984 + 0.289 = 1.1874 g.

So test tube mass is 11.149 - 1.1874 = 9.9616 grams, again matching option I.

So, the answer should be option I: 9.960 g.

To determine the weight of the test tube, we analyze the reaction:

\[
\text{CaO (s)} + \text{H}_2\text{O (g)} \rightarrow \text{Ca(OH)}_2 \text{ (s)}.
\]

### Key Steps:
1. **Initial and Final Weights**:  
   - Initial weight (CaO + test tube) = 10.860 g.  
   - Final weight (Ca(OH)₂ + test tube) = 11.149 g.  
   - The mass increase = 11.149 g - 10.860 g = 0.289 g, which corresponds to the mass of water absorbed.

2. **Moles of Water**:  
   The molar mass of H₂O is 18.015 g/mol.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of H}_2\text{O} = \frac{0.289}{18.015} \approx 0.01603 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

3. **Moles of CaO**:  
   From the reaction, the molar ratio of CaO to H₂O is 1:1. Therefore, moles of CaO = moles of H₂O = 0.01603 mol.

4. **Mass of CaO**:  
   The molar mass of CaO is 56.077 g/mol.  
   \[
   \text{Mass of CaO} = 0.01603 \times 56.077 \approx 0.8984 \, \text{g}.
   \]

5. **Mass of the Test Tube**:  
   The initial weight (CaO + test tube) is 10.860 g. Subtracting the mass of CaO gives:  
   \[
   \text{Mass of test tube} = 10.860 - 0.8984 \approx 9.9616 \, \text{g}.
   \]

6. **Final Answer**:  
   The calculated mass of the test tube (9.9616 g) rounds to 9.960 g, which matches option I.

### Conclusion:
The weight of the test tube is **9.960 g**.
