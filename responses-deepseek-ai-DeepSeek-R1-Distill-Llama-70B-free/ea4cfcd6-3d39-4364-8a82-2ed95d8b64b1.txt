H: \frac{1}{3}
I: \frac{1}{4}
J: \frac{1}{8}

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the probability of getting a sum of 4 when rolling two fair 6-sided dice. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when you roll two dice, each die has 6 faces, so the total number of possible outcomes is 6 multiplied by 6. That would be 36 possible outcomes in total. Yeah, that makes sense because each die is independent, so for each outcome of the first die, there are 6 possible outcomes for the second die.

Now, the question is about the sum being 4. I need to find all the possible pairs of numbers (one from each die) that add up to 4. Let me list out the possible combinations.

So, the first die can roll a 1. Then the second die would need to be 3, because 1 + 3 = 4. So that's one combination: (1,3).

Next, if the first die is 2, the second die needs to be 2 to make the sum 4. So that's (2,2). That's the second combination.

What if the first die is 3? Then the second die would need to be 1, so that's (3,1). That's the third combination.

Wait, what about if the first die is 4? Then the second die would have to be 0, which isn't possible because dice only go from 1 to 6. So beyond 3 on the first die, the second die would have numbers less than 1, which aren't possible. So the possible pairs are (1,3), (2,2), and (3,1). That's three combinations.

So there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 36 possible. So the probability is 3 divided by 36. Simplifying that, 3/36 is the same as 1/12. Wait, let me double-check that. 3 divided by 36 is indeed 1/12. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any combinations.

Wait, another approach: the sum of 4 can be achieved by the pairs (1,3), (2,2), (3,1). No others. So yes, three outcomes. So 3/36 reduces to 1/12. So the probability is 1/12.

Looking at the options, option G is 1/12. So I think that's the correct answer.

The probability of rolling a sum of 4 with two fair 6-sided dice is determined by identifying all favorable outcomes. Each die has 6 faces, resulting in 36 possible outcomes in total. The pairs that sum to 4 are (1,3), (2,2), and (3,1), giving 3 favorable outcomes. Thus, the probability is:

\[
\frac{\text{Favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{3}{36} = \frac{1}{12}
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is:

G: \frac{1}{12}

Answer: G
