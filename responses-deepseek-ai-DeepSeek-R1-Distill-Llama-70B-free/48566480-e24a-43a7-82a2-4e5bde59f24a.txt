Okay, so I've got this math problem here. It's about finding how many integers between 1 and 100 inclusive are divisible by either 2, 3, or 5. Hmm, I think I should use the principle of inclusion and exclusion for this. Let me try to remember how that works.

Alright, inclusion-exclusion is a method to count the number of elements in the union of multiple sets. So in this case, the sets are numbers divisible by 2, 3, and 5. I need to find the total numbers divisible by any of these, but I have to avoid double-counting those divisible by more than one.

Let me break it down. First, I'll calculate the number of integers divisible by each individually.

For 2: That's every second number. So 100 divided by 2 is 50. So 50 numbers.

For 3: 100 divided by 3 is approximately 33.333. But since we're dealing with whole numbers, it's 33.

For 5: 100 divided by 5 is 20.

So adding these up: 50 + 33 + 20 = 103. But wait, that's more than 100, which isn't possible because there are only 100 numbers. So I must have counted some numbers more than once. That's where the inclusion-exclusion comes in.

Next, I need to subtract the numbers that are divisible by the least common multiples (LCMs) of each pair. Because those were counted twice in the initial addition.

The pairs are (2,3), (2,5), and (3,5).

For 2 and 3: LCM is 6. 100/6 is about 16.666, so 16 numbers.

For 2 and 5: LCM is 10. 100/10 is 10.

For 3 and 5: LCM is 15. 100/15 is approximately 6.666, so 6 numbers.

So adding those: 16 + 10 + 6 = 32. Subtract this from the initial total: 103 - 32 = 71.

But wait, now I have subtracted too much because some numbers are divisible by all three, 2, 3, and 5. Those would have been subtracted three times in the pair steps, but they should only be subtracted once. So I need to add them back in once.

The LCM of 2,3,5 is 30. 100/30 is about 3.333, so 3 numbers.

So adding that back: 71 + 3 = 74.

Wait, but wait again. Let me check my steps. So initial counts: 50+33+20=103. Then subtract the pairwise overlaps: 16+10+6=32, so 103-32=71. Then add back the triple overlaps: 3, so 74. So the total is 74 numbers.

Looking at the options, option E is 74. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Numbers divisible by 2: 50. That's correct because 100/2=50.

By 3: 33. Because 3*33=99, which is less than 100, and 34*3=102 which is over.

By 5: 20, correct.

Then the overlaps:

2 and3: 16, since 6*16=96, 6*17=102>100.

2 and5: 10, 10*10=100.

3 and5: 15*6=90, 15*7=105>100, so 6.

So 16+10+6=32.

Triple: 30*3=90, 30*4=120>100, so 3.

So inclusion-exclusion formula:

|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |B∩C| + |A∩B∩C|

Plugging in the numbers: 50+33+20 = 103; subtract 16+10+6=32 → 71; add 3 →74.

Yes, that seems right. So the answer is E:74.

To determine how many integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) are divisible by either 2, 3, or 5, we use the principle of inclusion and exclusion.

1. **Count numbers divisible by each divisor individually:**
   - Divisible by 2: \( \left\lfloor \frac{100}{2} \right\rfloor = 50 \)
   - Divisible by 3: \( \left\lfloor \frac{100}{3} \right\rfloor = 33 \)
   - Divisible by 5: \( \left\lfloor \frac{100}{5} \right\rfloor = 20 \)

   Total: \( 50 + 33 + 20 = 103 \).

2. **Subtract numbers divisible by the LCM of each pair to correct for double-counting:**
   - Divisible by \( \text{LCM}(2, 3) = 6 \): \( \left\lfloor \frac{100}{6} \right\rfloor = 16 \)
   - Divisible by \( \text{LCM}(2, 5) = 10 \): \( \left\lfloor \frac{100}{10} \right\rfloor = 10 \)
   - Divisible by \( \text{LCM}(3, 5) = 15 \): \( \left\lfloor \frac{100}{15} \right\rfloor = 6 \)

   Total: \( 16 + 10 + 6 = 32 \).

   Adjusted total: \( 103 - 32 = 71 \).

3. **Add back numbers divisible by the LCM of all three to correct for over-subtraction:**
   - Divisible by \( \text{LCM}(2, 3, 5) = 30 \): \( \left\lfloor \frac{100}{30} \right\rfloor = 3 \).

   Final total: \( 71 + 3 = 74 \).

Thus, the number of integers between 1 and 100 divisible by either 2, 3, or 5 is **74**.
