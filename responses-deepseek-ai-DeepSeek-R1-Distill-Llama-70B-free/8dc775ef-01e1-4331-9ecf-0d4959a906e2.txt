Okay, so I have this question about medical ethics, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is a 35-year-old man who tested positive for HIV. He doesn't want to tell his wife because he had extramarital affairs, which he hasn't disclosed to her. The doctor is advising him that his wife's right to know is most important because she could also be HIV positive. The question is about which ethical principle is at play here.

I remember that in medical ethics, there are four main principles: autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice. Let me think about each one.

Autonomy is about respecting the patient's right to make their own decisions. So, the patient here might want to keep his condition secret to protect his privacy or avoid personal issues at home.

Beneficence is the duty to promote good and act in the best interest of the patient and others. It's about doing what's best for them. In this case, the doctor is considering the wife's well-being. If she's unaware, she might be at risk of contracting HIV or not getting treated if she's already positive.

Nonmaleficence means do no harm. By not telling the wife, the patient could be putting her at risk of infection, which would be doing harm. But wait, the doctor is advising disclosure, which is aimed at preventing harm to the wife.

Justice refers to fairness and distribution. It's about treating people equally and ensuring that resources and risks are distributed fairly. Here, it's more about the wife's right to know to protect her health, which seems more about beneficence than justice.

So the question is, which principle is overriding another. The physician is saying the wife's right to know is paramount. That suggests that the doctor is prioritizing the wife's health (beneficence) over the patient's autonomy.

Wait, let me think again. So, the patient's autonomy is his right to decide not to disclose. But the doctor is prioritizing the wife's right to know because of the risk of her being HIV positive. So the doctor is emphasizing beneficence towards the wife.

Putting it together: the principle here is that the doctor is prioritizing the well-being (beneficence) of the wife over the patient's autonomy to keep it secret. So the relationship is that beneficence overrides autonomy.

Looking at the options, option J is "beneficence overrides autonomy." That seems to fit.

Wait, but another angle: sometimes in public health, the principle of justice comes into play when it's about protecting others. But in this case, it's more direct, about one individual's right to know to prevent harm. So it's about the doctor's duty to promote the wife's well-being, which is beneficence.

Alternatively, some might think about nonmaleficence. By not telling, the wife could be harmed. So the doctor is preventing harm, which is nonmaleficence. But the question is about the wife's right to know, which is more about her being able to make decisions for her own health—so that's more about autonomy for her, but in this case, the patient's autonomy is being limited.

So perhaps the physician is balancing the patient's autonomy against the potential harm to the wife. So the principle here is that nonmaleficence (do no harm) is overriding autonomy.

Wait, but in the scenario, the physician is informing the patient that the wife's right to know is paramount. So the main issue is the wife's right, which is about her health and well-being—so that's beneficence towards her.

So the physician is prioritizing the well-being (beneficence) of the wife over the patient's right to keep it secret (autonomy). So the correct relationship is beneficence overriding autonomy, which is option J.

The question involves a 35-year-old man who tests positive for HIV and resists disclosing his condition to his wife due to extramarital affairs. The physician emphasizes the wife's right to know, prioritizing her health and well-being. This scenario raises ethical considerations, primarily involving the principles of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice.

- **Autonomy** refers to the patient's right to make decisions about his own life and privacy. In this case, the patient wishes to keep his HIV status secret.
- **Beneficence** is the duty to promote good and act in the best interest of others. The physician is prioritizing the wife's right to know to protect her health and prevent potential harm.
- **Nonmaleficence** involves avoiding harm. Withholding the HIV diagnosis could lead to harm to the wife, but the physician's recommendation is more focused on promoting her well-being.
- **Justice** pertains to fairness and equity, but this scenario does not primarily involve distributive concerns.

The physician's recommendation centers on prioritizing the wife's health and well-being, which aligns with the principle of **beneficence**. This principle overrides the patient's **autonomy** to keep his condition secret. Therefore, the relationship that best describes the physician's rationale is **beneficence overriding autonomy**.

**Answer: J**
