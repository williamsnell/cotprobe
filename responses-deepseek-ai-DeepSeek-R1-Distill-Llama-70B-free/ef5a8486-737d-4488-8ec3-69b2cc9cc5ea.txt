Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with gas laws and molecular weight calculations. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, let's read the problem again. So, a researcher isolated a compound that's a volatile liquid. The boiling point is 65°C, but the collection is done at 98°C to prevent liquefaction. They took a sample of 0.134 grams, vaporized it, and collected the gas. The volume after vaporization is 0.0532 liters at 98°C and 737 mmHg. We need to find the molecular weight.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that when dealing with gases, the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. And since we're dealing with a sample of known mass, we can find moles using mass and molecular weight. So the plan is probably to use the ideal gas law to find moles of gas, then relate that to the mass to find molecular weight.

Wait, but wait, the steps. Let me think. The molecular weight (M) is mass (m) divided by moles (n), so M = m/n. So first, I need to find n from the gas data.

Right. So using PV = nRT. But I need to make sure all the units are correct. Let's list the given values:

Pressure (P) = 737 mmHg. Oh, right, I need to convert that to atmospheres because R is commonly 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). So, 1 atm is 760 mmHg. So P = 737 / 760 atm. Let me calculate that. 737 divided by 760... Let me see, 760 is about 7.37*100, so 737/760 ≈ 0.9697 atm? Wait, let me compute it accurately. 737 ÷ 760. Let's do this: 760 is 760, 737 is 23 less. So 737 = 760 -23. So 737/760 = 1 - (23/760) ≈ 1 - 0.03026 = 0.9697 atm. So approximately 0.9697 atm.

Temperature (T) is 98°C. I need to convert that to Kelvin. So T = 98 + 273.15 = 371.15 K.

Volume (V) is 0.0532 liters. That's already in liters, so that's fine.

R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

So plugging into PV = nRT:

n = PV/(RT)

Let me compute that step by step.

P = 0.9697 atm
V = 0.0532 L
R = 0.0821
T = 371.15 K

So n = (0.9697 * 0.0532) / (0.0821 * 371.15)

Let me calculate the numerator first: 0.9697 * 0.0532. Let's see, 0.9697 is roughly 0.97, so 0.97 * 0.0532. Hmm, 0.97 * 0.05 is 0.0485, and 0.97 * 0.0032 is about 0.003104. So total around 0.0516. But precise calculation: 9697 * 532 = let's see, but maybe I can just multiply them step by step.

0.9697 * 0.0532 = ?

Let me compute 0.9697 * 0.05 = 0.048485, and 0.9697 * 0.0032 = approximately 0.003104. So total is 0.048485 + 0.003104 = 0.051589. So approximately 0.051589 atm·L.

Denominator: 0.0821 * 371.15.

0.0821 * 300 is 24.63, 0.0821 *71.15 is about 5.84. So 24.63 +5.84=30.47. Let's compute exact value.

0.0821 *371.15 = ?

Well, 371.15 * 0.0821. Let me compute 371 *0.0821:

371 * 0.08 = 29.68
371 * 0.0021 = approx 0.7791
So total 29.68 + 0.7791 = 30.4591. Then, 0.15 *0.0821 is 0.012315. So total denominator is 30.4591 +0.012315 ≈30.4714.

So n = 0.051589 / 30.4714 ≈ 0.001692 moles.

Wait, let me double-check the numbers because I'm not sure if I did them right. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute using a calculator approach.

Compute numerator: 0.9697 * 0.0532.

Hmm, 0.9697 * 0.0532.

= (0.9 * 0.0532) + (0.0697 * 0.0532)
= 0.04788 + 0.00370164
= 0.05158164 ≈ 0.05158.

Denominator: 0.0821 * 371.15 = 

= 0.0821 * (300 +71.15)
= (0.0821 *300) + (0.0821 *71.15)
= 24.63 + (0.0821 *70=5.747) + (0.0821 *1.15=0.094415)
= 24.63 +5.747 +0.094415 = 24.63 +5.841415 = 30.471415.

So denominator is ~30.4714.

So n = 0.05158 /30.4714 ≈ 0.001692 mol.

So n ≈ 0.001692 moles.

Now, the mass of the sample is 0.134 grams. So molecular weight (M) is mass (m) divided by moles (n): M = m/n.

So M = 0.134 g / 0.001692 mol ≈ ?

Let me compute 0.134 / 0.001692.

0.001692 is approximately 1.692e-3.

0.134 / 0.001692 = let's see, 0.134 / 0.001692.

Hmm, 0.001692 * 80 = 0.13536. Oh, that's interesting. Because 0.001692 * 80 = 0.13536, which is just a bit higher than 0.134 (0.134 is 0.001 less than 0.135).

So 80 would give us 0.13536, which is 0.00136 higher than 0.134. So perhaps approximately 79.1 or so.

Alternatively, compute it precisely.

Let me write it as 134 / 1.692.

134 ÷ 1.692.

Well, 1.692 * 79 = ?

1.692 *70 = 118.44

1.692 *9 = 15.228

Total for 79: 118.44 +15.228 = 133.668.

That's very close to 134.

So 79 is 133.668, which is 0.332 less than 134.

So 79 + (0.332 /1.692) = 79 + approx 0.196.

So about 79.196. So M ≈79.2 g/mol.

Wait, but wait. Wait, 79.196 is about 79.2. So looking at the options, option D is 79.018 g/mol. Hmm, that's close. But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check all calculations again.

Wait, let me recalculate n more accurately.

n = (P V) / (R T) = (0.9697 atm * 0.0532 L) / (0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) * 371.15 K)

Compute numerator: 0.9697 * 0.0532.

Let me compute this accurately.

0.9697 * 0.05 = 0.048485
0.9697 * 0.0032 = 0.00310464
Adding them: 0.048485 + 0.00310464 = 0.05158964 atm·L.

Denominator: 0.0821 *371.15 = let's compute.

0.0821 *371.15.

Compute 0.08 *371.15 = 29.692

0.0021 *371.15 = 0.779815

So total denominator = 29.692 + 0.779815 = 30.471815 ≈30.4718.

So n = 0.05158964 / 30.4718 ≈ 0.0016925 mol.

So mass is 0.134 g, so M = 0.134 /0.0016925.

Compute 0.134 / 0.0016925.

Hmm. Let's write this as (134 x10^-3 ) / (1.6925 x10^-3) ) = 134 /1.6925.

Compute 134 ÷1.6925.

Let me see:

1.6925 * 79 = ?

1.6925 *70 = 118.475

1.6925 *9 = 15.2325

Total 118.475 +15.2325 = 133.7075.

So 79 gives 133.7075, which is 134 -133.7075=0.2925 left.

So 0.2925 /1.6925 ≈ 0.1727.

So 79 + 0.1727=79.1727.

So M≈79.17 g/mol.

Looking at the options, option D is 79.018, which is close. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise numbers. Let me check my initial pressure calculation.

Wait, P was 737 mmHg. So 737/760 = ?

737 ÷760. Let me compute exactly.

760 -737=23.

737/760 = 1 - (23/760)= 1 - 0.03026316=0.96973684 atm. So P=0.96973684 atm.

V=0.0532 L.

R=0.082057 (more precise value) but I used 0.0821, which is acceptable.

T=98°C=371.15 K.

So, exact calculation:

n = (0.96973684 *0.0532) / (0.082057 * 371.15)

Compute numerator:

0.96973684 *0.0532.

Let me compute this accurately.

0.96973684 *0.05 =0.04848684

0.96973684 *0.0032=0.00310235488

Sum=0.04848684 +0.00310235488=0.05158919488 atm·L.

Denominator: 0.082057 *371.15.

Compute 0.082057 *371.15.

Compute 0.082057 *371 = let me compute 0.08 *371=29.68, 0.002057 *371=0.762. So 29.68+0.762=30.442.

Wait, perhaps better to compute step by step.

0.082057 * 371.15 = ?

Compute each part:

0.082057 *300 =24.6171

0.082057 *70 =5.744

0.082057 *1.15=0.094365 approx.

Wait, wait, let me compute 0.082057 *70.

0.082057 *70 = (0.08 *70) + (0.002057 *70) =5.6 +0.14399=5.74399.

Then 0.082057 *1.15.

Compute 0.082057 *1 =0.082057, 0.082057 *0.15=0.01230855. So sum is 0.09436555.

So adding all together:

300:24.6171

70:5.74399 → total now 24.6171 +5.74399 =30.36109

1.15:0.09436555 → total 30.36109 +0.09436555=30.455455.

So denominator is 30.455455.

So n = 0.05158919488 / 30.455455 ≈ 0.001693 mol.

Then M = 0.134 g /0.001693 mol ≈ ?

Compute 0.134 /0.001693.

Again, 0.134 /0.001693 = ?

Multiply numerator and denominator by 1000 to get rid of decimals:

134 /1.693 ≈ ?

Compute 1.693 *79 = ?

1.693 *70=118.51

1.693 *9=15.237 → 118.51 +15.237=133.747.

So 79 →133.747, which is 134-133.747=0.253 left.

So 0.253 /1.693 ≈0.1494.

So total M≈79 +0.1494=79.1494 g/mol.

So approximately 79.15 g/mol.

Looking at the options, option D is 79.018, which is a bit lower. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 0.134 /0.001693 more accurately.

0.134 ÷ 0.001693.

Let me compute 0.001693 *79=0.1336 (since 0.001693 *80=0.13544, which I know is more than 0.134).

So 0.001693 *79 = ?

0.001693 *70=0.11851

0.001693 *9=0.015237 → sum 0.133747.

So 79 gives 0.133747, which is 0.000253 less than 0.134.

So the difference is 0.000253. So how much more than 79?

0.000253 /0.001693 ≈ 0.1493.

So M≈79.1493 g/mol.

Hmm, so approximately 79.15. Looking at the options, option D is 79.018, which is a bit lower, but maybe I made a mistake in an earlier step.

Wait, perhaps I should check the initial pressure calculation again.

Wait, 737 mmHg to atm: 737/760 = let me compute 737 ÷760.

Use calculator steps: 760 ×0.9697=737.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute 737/760 more accurately.

737 ÷760 = 

737 ÷760 → let's compute as 737 ÷760.

Well, 760 ×0.9697 =737. 760 ×0.9697 = 760*(0.9 +0.06 +0.0097) = 760*0.9=684, 760*0.06=45.6, 760*0.0097=7.372. So 684+45.6=729.6 +7.372=736.972, which is approximately 737. So P=0.9697 atm correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the volume or temperature.

Wait, the volume is 0.0532 liters, correct.

Temperature is 98°C, which is 371.15 K, correct.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the ideal gas law calculation. Let me compute n more accurately.

n = (0.96973684 atm *0.0532 L) / (0.082057 L·atm/mol·K *371.15 K)

Compute numerator: 0.96973684 *0.0532 = ?

Let me compute it precisely.

0.96973684 *0.05=0.04848684

0.96973684 *0.0032 = 

0.96973684 *0.003 =0.00290921052

0.96973684 *0.0002=0.000193947368

So 0.00290921052 +0.000193947368=0.00310315789.

Total numerator:0.04848684 +0.00310315789=0.05158999779 ≈0.05159 atm·L.

Denominator:0.082057 *371.15 =30.4555.

So n=0.05159 /30.4555= approximately 0.001693 mol.

Then M=0.134 /0.001693= approx 79.15 g/mol.

Hmm, but the option D is 79.018, which is a bit lower. Maybe I should check if I have any miscalculations here.

Wait, perhaps I should consider significant figures. Let me check the given values.

Sample mass: 0.134 g → three significant figures.

Volume:0.0532 L → three sig figs.

Pressure:737 mmHg → three.

Temperature:98°C → two (if written as 98, but maybe three? Because 98 is two, but if it were 98.0, then three. So perhaps two sig figs.

Wait, the temperature is given as 98°C, which is two sig figs, so 371 K (two sig figs). Wait, but 98°C is 371.15 K, but when considering sig figs, it's two, so 3.7e2 K?

Wait, maybe that's where the mistake is. Because, if temperature is two sig figs, then our calculations would be limited. Let's see.

So if T is 371 K (two sig figs, 3.7e2), then our n calculation would be two sig figs.

Wait, let me redo the calculation with T as 3.7e2 K.

So T=371 K (but written as 3.7e2, so two sig figs).

n = (0.9697 *0.0532) / (0.0821 *371)

Compute denominator:0.0821 *371= let's compute 0.0821 *370=30.477; 0.0821*(371)=30.477 +0.0821=30.5591.

Wait, but wait, 0.0821 *371= (0.08 *371) + (0.0021 *371) )=29.68 +0.7791=30.459
