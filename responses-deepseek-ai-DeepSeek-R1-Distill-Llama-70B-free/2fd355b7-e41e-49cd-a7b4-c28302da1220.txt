Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about colorblindness. Hmm, let's see. I remember that red-green colorblindness is a recessive trait and it's X-linked. So it's on the X chromosome. That probably means it's more common in males because they have only one X.

The question is about a woman with normal vision whose father was colorblind. She marries a man with normal vision, and they want to know the probability their first child is colorblind.

Alright, let's break this down. First, let's think about the woman's genotype. Her father was colorblind, which means his X must have had the recessive allele. Since the woman's dad had colorblindness, and assuming the mother wasn't, the woman's X chromosomes would be one from each parent.

Wait, wait. The woman has normal vision, so she can't have the colorblind allele on both X's. Since her father was colorblind, he gave her his X with the recessive gene (let's say 'c'). Her mother must have given a normal X ('C'), because the woman doesn't have colorblindness. So the woman's genotype is Cc? No, wait—wait, no, wait. For X-linked recessive, females have two X's. So the woman has one X from dad (which would be c) and one from mom. But wait, her mom's genotype? The problem doesn't say anything about the mother. Oh wait, the woman's father was colorblind, so her mother must have given her a normal X, because the woman isn't colorblind. So the woman's genotype is C from her mother and c from her father, making her a carrier, Cc.

Wait, no, no. Wait, no—wait, wait. Wait, no, X-linked recessive: for a daughter to be affected, she needs two copies of the recessive allele. So if the woman is not colorblind, she's either CC or Cc. But since her father was colorblind (so his X was c), and her mother must have contributed a C. So the woman is Cc.

Now, the man she's marrying has normal vision. Since the trait is recessive and X-linked, and males have only one X (they get it from their mother), the man's X must be C because he doesn't have colorblindness. So his genotype is just C (XY where the X is C).

Wait, no—wait, no, men have XY. So their X comes from their mother. So the man has X^C Y. Right.

So the woman is Cc (X^C from mom, X^c from dad) and the man is X^C Y.

Now, let's think about their children. Each child gets an X from each parent. Let's think about sons and daughters.

The woman can pass either her X^C or X^c. The man can only pass his X^C to daughters (since sons get his Y).

So for a daughter: she gets X from mom (either C or c) and X from dad (C). So possible combinations are X^C (mom) and X^C (dad) → X^C X^C, or X^c (mom) and X^C (dad) → X^C X^c. So daughters would either be CC or Cc. Neither would be colorblind because they have at least one dominant C allele.

For a son: he gets Y from dad and X from mom. So if mom gives X^C, son is X^C Y → normal vision. If mom gives X^c, son is X^c Y → colorblind.

So the probability that a son is colorblind is the probability that the mother passes her c allele.

The mother is Cc, so she has a 50% chance of passing C and 50% chance of passing c.

So for each son, 50% chance of colorblindness.

But wait, the question is about the first child. So first, what's the chance the first child is a son? Well, assuming the probability of having a son is 50%.

Wait, but the question is about any first child, regardless of gender. So the overall probability is the probability that the child is colorblind.

So possible scenarios:

If it's a daughter: cannot be colorblind (since she has at least one C allele).

If it's a son: 50% chance he's colorblind.

So the total probability is (probability child is son) × (probability he's colorblind) + (probability child is daughter) × 0.

So that would be 0.5 × 0.5 + 0.5 × 0 = 0.25, or 25%. So 1/4.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Let's outline all possibilities.

The woman can produce two types of eggs: C (50%) or c (50%).

The man can produce two types of sperm: C (50%, but wait no, wait. Wait, no: wait, no—men produce X or Y sperm. Wait, no—the man has genotype X^C Y. So his sperm can be either X^C or Y. So when the woman's egg (C or c) combines with the man's sperm (X^C or Y), let's map out the possibilities.

So possible combinations:

1. Woman's egg C + man's sperm X^C → daughter X^C X^C → not colorblind.
2. Woman's egg C + man's sperm Y → son X^C Y → not colorblind.
3. Woman's egg c + man's sperm X^C → daughter X^C X^c → not colorblind (because she has a C).
4. Woman's egg c + man's sperm Y → son X^c Y → colorblind.

Now, each of these four scenarios is equally likely because each parent's gametes are 50% each.

So out of four possible children, how many are colorblind?

Only the fourth scenario: son with X^c Y. So 1 out of 4.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, each scenario isn't equally likely. Because the man's sperm is either X or Y, each with 50% chance, and the woman's egg is C or c, each 50% chance.

So the four possible combinations each have 25% chance (0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 each). So the only colorblind child is scenario 4: son with X^c Y, which is 25% chance.

So the probability that their first child is colorblind is 25%, which is 1/4. So the correct answer is G.

To determine the probability that the first child of a normal-visioned woman (whose father was colorblind) and a normal-visioned man will be colorblind, we analyze the genetic inheritance of the X-linked recessive trait for red-green colorblindness.

### Key Information:
1. **Colorblindness (c)** is a recessive X-linked gene. This means:
   - Females (XX) must inherit two copies of the recessive allele (one from each parent) to express the condition.
   - Males (XY) need only one copy of the recessive allele (from their single X chromosome) to express the condition.

2. The woman has normal vision but is a carrier. Her genotype is **Cc**:
   - She inherited one normal allele (**C**) from her mother and one colorblind allele (**c**) from her father (who was colorblind).

3. The man has normal vision, so his genotype is **XᶜY**:
   - He contributes a normal allele (**C**) from his X chromosome to any daughter and a Y chromosome to any son.

### Genetic Cross:
- The woman (**Cc**) can pass on either **C** (50% chance) or **c** (50% chance) from her X chromosomes.
- The man (**XᶜY**) can pass on either **Xᶜ** (50% chance) to a daughter or **Y** (50% chance) to a son.

#### Possible Offspring:
1. **Daughter (Xᶜ from mother + Xᶜ from father):** Genotype **XᶜXᶜ** (normal vision).
2. **Daughter (c from mother + Xᶜ from father):** Genotype **XᶜXᶜ** (normal vision, carrier of **c**).
3. **Son (Xᶜ from mother + Y from father):** Genotype **XᶜY** (normal vision).
4. **Son (c from mother + Y from father):** Genotype **XᶜY** (colorblind).

### Probability of Colorblindness:
- Among the four possible outcomes, only one results in a colorblind child: a son inheriting the **c** allele from the mother.
- The probability of this occurring is **1/4** (25%).

Thus, the probability that their first child will be colorblind is **1/4**.
