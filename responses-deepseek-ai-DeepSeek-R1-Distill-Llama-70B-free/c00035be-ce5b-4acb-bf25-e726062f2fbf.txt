Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these pH calculations. But let's take it step by step. The question is about finding the pH of a 0.500 M solution of NaHSO3. I remember that NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfate, which is a salt that comes from a weak acid, H2SO3 (sulfurous acid). 

Wait, right! NaHSO3 dissociates into Na+ and HSO3^- ions in water. But since HSO3^- is the conjugate base of H2SO3, which is a weak acid, HSO3^- can act as a base. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, HSO3^- itself is an acid, right? Because sulfurous acid is diprotic. H2SO3 can lose two protons. So HSO3^- is the first deprotonation, and then it can lose another to become SO3^2-.

Hmm, but wait, in this case, NaHSO3 is the sodium salt of HSO3^- and H+ (from H2SO3). So when NaHSO3 dissolves in water, it dissociates into Na+ and HSO3^- ions. Now, HSO3^- can act as an acid by donating a proton to water, right? So the reaction would be HSO3^- + H2O ↔ H2SO3 + OH^-? Or wait, wait—am I mixing things up? Because HSO3^- is the conjugate base of H2SO3, so when it donates a proton, it becomes H2SO3. Wait no, wait: HSO3^- is the conjugate base of H2SO3. So it can accept a proton to become H2SO3, or donate a proton to become SO3^2-.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think: the first dissociation of H2SO3 is H2SO3 ↔ H+ + HSO3^- (Ka1 is around 1.3e-2, I think). The second is HSO3^- ↔ H+ + SO3^2- (Ka2 is smaller, like 6.3e-8 or something). So in solution, NaHSO3 dissociates into Na+ and HSO3^-.

So when HSO3^- is in water, it can either donate a proton (act as an acid) or accept a proton (act as a base). But wait, since HSO3^- is the conjugate base of H2SO3, its ability to act as a base would depend on the Kb. Alternatively, since it's an amphiprotic species, it can go either way.

Wait, but in this case, since we're dealing with the solution of NaHSO3, which is a salt, the pH will depend on the hydrolysis of HSO3^- in water. So HSO3^- can act as an acid or a base. But which is more significant?

I think I need to compare the Ka of HSO3^- acting as an acid with the Kb of HSO3^- acting as a base. Because if it's a stronger acid than base, the solution will be acidic. If it's a stronger base, the solution will be basic. Or wait, no, since HSO3^- is the conjugate base of H2SO3, which is a weak acid. So it can act as a base, but it's also a weak acid itself.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the two equilibria. HSO3^- can either donate a proton (acting as an acid, forming SO3^2- and H+) or accept a proton (acting as a base, forming H2SO3 and OH^-). So which direction is more favorable?

The problem gives the K_eq for NaHSO3 as 1.26e-2. Wait, what's K_eq here? Oh, wait, I think that's the acid dissociation constant for HSO3^- when it donates a proton. Because NaHSO3 is the sodium salt of HSO3^-, and the K_eq given must be the Ka for HSO3^- acting as an acid. Because when you have a salt like this, the anion can act as an acid, and the K for that is the Ka of the anion.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes the K given could be the K for the hydrolysis, but in this problem, it's presented as K_eq, which I think is the acid dissociation constant for HSO3^-.

So, assuming that K_eq (Ka) is 1.26e-2, which is around 1.3e-2. That's a moderately strong acid, but not very strong. So HSO3^- is a weak acid, so when it donates a proton, it doesn't completely dissociate.

But wait, in this solution, the HSO3^- is in water. So its behavior is as an acid. So the solution should be acidic because HSO3^- donates H+ ions into the solution.

So the pH should be less than 7.

Wait, but another thought. Since HSO3^- is also a base, can it accept protons from water? So the solution might have both H+ and OH- contributions. But which effect is stronger?

The K_eq given is the Ka for HSO3^- acting as an acid. So the Kb for the base reaction would be Kw / Ka2 of H2SO3, right? Wait, no, because HSO3^- is the conjugate base of H2SO3, so the Kb of HSO3^- is Kw / Ka1 of H2SO3. Wait, let me get this straight.

H2SO3 is a diprotic acid. The first dissociation is H2SO3 ↔ H+ + HSO3^-; Ka1 is about 1.3e-2. The second dissociation is HSO3^- ↔ H+ + SO3^2-; Ka2 is about 6.3e-8.

So the Kb for HSO3^- acting as a base would be the Kb for the reaction HSO3^- + H2O ↔ H2SO3 + OH^-.

The Kb would be Kw / Ka2. Because HSO3^- is the conjugate base of H2SO3, so Kb = Kw / Ka1? Or wait, no. Let me think: For the base reaction, the conjugate acid is H2SO3. So Kb = Kw / Ka of the conjugate acid. But the conjugate acid of HSO3^- is H2SO3, whose Ka is Ka1, which is 1.3e-2.

Wait, no. Wait, when HSO3^- acts as a base, it accepts a proton to form H2SO3. So the reaction is:

HSO3^- + H2O ↔ H2SO3 + OH^-

The equilibrium for this would have Kb = [H2SO3][OH^-] / [HSO3^-].

But since H2SO3 can donate a proton (Ka1), so the relation between them is Kw = Ka1 * Kb. So Kb = Kw / Ka1.

So Kb = (1e-14) / (1.3e-2) ≈ 7.69e-13.

That's a very small Kb, so the base reaction is not significant compared to the acid reaction. So the main contribution to H+ comes from the acid dissociation of HSO3^-.

So the solution will be acidic.

But wait, I'm given the K_eq as 1.26e-2, which I think is the Ka for HSO3^- acting as an acid. So the K_eq here is the Ka.

So, to find the pH, I can model the dissociation of HSO3^- in water.

The initial concentration is 0.500 M NaHSO3, which dissociates completely into Na+ and HSO3^- ions. So [HSO3^-] initial is 0.500 M.

The reaction is HSO3^- ↔ H+ + SO3^2-.

The Ka for this reaction is 1.26e-2. Let's set up the ICE table.

Initial concentrations:
HSO3^- : 0.500 M
H+ : 0
SO3^2- : 0

Change:
HSO3^- : -x
H+ : +x
SO3^2- : +x

Equilibrium concentrations:
HSO3^- : 0.500 - x
H+ : x
SO3^2- : x

So the Ka expression is:

Ka = [H+][SO3^2-] / [HSO3^-] = x^2 / (0.500 - x) = 1.26e-2.

Now, I can approximate whether x is small compared to 0.500. Let's see: if x is small, then 0.500 - x ≈ 0.500.

So, x^2 / 0.500 ≈ 1.26e-2 → x^2 ≈ 1.26e-2 * 0.500 = 6.3e-3 → x ≈ sqrt(6.3e-3) ≈ 0.0794 M.

Wait, let's check if this is a valid approximation. 0.0794 is about 15.88% of 0.500. Hmm, that's a bit high; the 5% rule of thumb is usually used. So perhaps the approximation isn't the best, and we should solve the quadratic equation.

So the equation is x^2 = 1.26e-2 (0.500 - x).

Expanding that:

x^2 = (1.26e-2)(0.500) - (1.26e-2)x
x^2 + 1.26e-2 x - (6.3e-3) = 0.

Wait, let me write it correctly. The full expression is x² = (1.26e-2)(0.500 - x), so:

x² = (1.26e-2 * 0.500) - (1.26e-2)x
x² + 1.26e-2 x - (6.3e-3) = 0.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me rearrange the equation:

x² = 1.26e-2 (0.500 - x)
x² = (1.26e-2 * 0.500) - (1.26e-2) x
Bring all terms to one side:
x² + (1.26e-2) x - (6.3e-3) = 0.

Wait, no, let me compute 1.26e-2 * 0.500. 1.26e-2 is 0.0126. 0.0126 * 0.5 is 0.0063. So the equation is:

x² = 0.0063 - 0.0126 x
Moving all terms to left:
x² + 0.0126 x - 0.0063 = 0.

Now, using the quadratic formula, x = [-b ± sqrt(b² + 4ac)]/(2a), where a=1, b=0.0126, c=-0.0063.

Discriminant D = (0.0126)^2 + 4 * 1 * 0.0063.

Calculating:

(0.0126)^2 = 0.00015876
4 * 0.0063 = 0.0252
D = 0.00015876 + 0.0252 ≈ 0.02535876.

Square root of D: sqrt(0.02535876) ≈ 0.1592.

So x = [-0.0126 ± 0.1592]/(2*1).

We can ignore the negative root because x represents concentration, which can't be negative.

x = ( -0.0126 + 0.1592 ) / 2 = (0.1466)/2 ≈ 0.0733 M.

So x ≈ 0.0733 M.

So [H+] is 0.0733 M. Then pH is -log(0.0733).

Calculating that: log(7.33e-2) = log(7.33) + log(1e-2). log(7.33) is about 0.864, so 0.864 - 2 = -1.136. So pH is 1.136? Wait no, wait, wait: pH is -log[H+], so it's -log(7.33e-2)= approximately 1.136? Wait, but that doesn't make sense because 0.0733 is about 7.33e-2, which has a pH around 1.14.

Wait, but let me double-check. Using a calculator:

log(0.0733) = log(7.33 × 10^-2) = log(7.33) + (-2) log(10) → approximately 0.864 - 2 = -1.136. So pH is 1.136, which is around 1.14. But looking at the options, the closest is option A:1.13, H:2.00, etc.

Wait, but wait a minute. I think I made a mistake in setting up the problem. Because NaHSO3 is the sodium salt, and when it dissociates, it's HSO3^- in solution. But HSO3^- can act as an acid, donating a proton to become SO3^2-, but it can also act as a base, accepting a proton to form H2SO3. Wait, but earlier I thought that the Kb for HSO3^- acting as a base is very small, so the main contribution is from the acid dissociation.

Wait, so in this case, the solution should be acidic, pH less than 7. But according to the calculation, pH is about 1.13, which is option A. But the options also have B:1.90, F:2.70, etc. So why is the pH so low?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, another approach: since HSO3^- is acting as an acid, and the concentration is 0.5 M, and the Ka is 1.26e-2, which is a relatively high value for a weak acid. So the pH shouldn't be extremely low.

Wait, wait, let me think: for a 0.5 M solution of a weak acid with Ka = 0.0126, the [H+] is around 0.073, as I calculated, so pH is about 1.14. But that seems quite acidic. Is that correct?

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that HSO3^- can also hydrolyze as a base. But earlier calculation showed that Kb is very small, so that effect is negligible.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider both the acid and base hydrolysis. But that would complicate things, and since Kb is so small, perhaps it's negligible.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption that the K_eq given is the Ka for HSO3^- acting as an acid. Maybe it's the hydrolysis constant for the overall reaction, which includes both H+ and OH- contributions. Wait, but the question says, "The K_eq for NaHSO3 is 1.26 × 10^-2." Hmm, maybe that's the K for the hydrolysis reaction of NaHSO3.

Wait, NaHSO3 is a salt, so its hydrolysis would be HSO3^- + H2O ↔ H2SO3 + OH^-. So the K for this reaction would be Kb, which is Kw / Ka1.

Wait, earlier I calculated Kb as 7.69e-13, which is much smaller than the given K_eq of 1.26e-2. So that doesn't align. Alternatively, perhaps the K_eq given is the Ka for HSO3^- acting as an acid, which is the same as the second dissociation of H2SO3, which is Ka2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify:

NaHSO3 dissociates into Na+ and HSO3^-. HSO3^- can either donate a proton (acting as an acid, with Ka2) or accept a proton (acting as a base, with Kb = Kw / Ka1).

In this problem, the K_eq given is 1.26e-2, which is higher than Ka2 of HSO3^- (which is around 6.3e-8). So perhaps the given K_eq is the Ka1 of H2SO3, but that's around 1.3e-2, which is the same as the given value. So perhaps the given K_eq is the Ka for HSO3^- acting as an acid, but that doesn't make sense because HSO3^- as an acid would have Ka2 = 6.3e-8. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the given K_eq is the acid dissociation constant for HSO3^- acting as an acid, but that would be Ka2, which is much smaller than 1.26e-2. So perhaps the given K_eq is the Ka for the first dissociation, but that's for H2SO3, not HSO3^-.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to approach it again.

The problem states that the K_eq for NaHSO3 is 1.26e-2. I think that refers to the hydrolysis constant Kh, which is the equilibrium for the reaction of HSO3^- with water acting as an acid or base. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the given K_eq is the Ka for HSO3^- acting as an acid, which would be the same as the Ka2 of H2SO3. But that's 6.3e-8, which doesn't match the given value. So perhaps the given K_eq is the Ka for the first dissociation of H2SO3, which is about 1.3e-2, so that would make sense.

Wait, then in that case, NaHSO3 would be the salt of the first dissociation. So in solution, HSO3^- can act as a base, accepting a proton to form H2SO3 and release OH^-.

So the reaction would be HSO3^- + H2O ↔ H2SO3 + OH^-.

The K for this reaction would be Kb = Kw / Ka1. Since Ka1 is 1.26e-2, Kb = (1e-14)/(1.26e-2) ≈ 7.94e-13.

That's a very small Kb, so the solution would be slightly basic, but considering the high concentration (0.5 M), maybe the pH is slightly above
