Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about econometrics, specifically regarding estimation techniques for over-identified systems of simultaneous equations. Hmm, I need to figure out which of the given options (i to iv) are applicable.

First, let me recall what each estimation method stands for and what they're used for. 

The question lists four techniques:
i) OLS - Ordinary Least Squares
ii) ILS - Indirect Least Squares
iii) 2SLS - Two-Stage Least Squares
iv) IV - Instrumental Variables

I remember that in econometrics, systems of equations can be either just-identified or over-identified. Over-identified systems have more equations than variables, so they have more restrictions, and we can't estimate them using methods that require exactly as many instruments as variables.

Starting with OLS (i). OLS is typically used for single equation models. It doesn't handle simultaneous equations well because it doesn't account for the correlation between the error term and the explanatory variables when they are endogenous. So in a system of equations, especially over-identified, OLS isn't appropriate for each equation if there's endogeneity. But wait, maybe OLS is used in some limited way here? I'm not sure. Maybe not applicable for the entire system.

Then there's ILS (ii), Indirect Least Squares. ILS is used for estimating the reduced form of a just-identified system. It's a method where you substitute the reduced form equations into the structural equations to get expressions that can be estimated. But I think ILS can only be applied when the system is just-identified. So for over-identified systems, ILS might not work because there are more equations than variables, leading to more restrictions than can be handled by ILS. So ILS might not be applicable here.

Next is 2SLS (iii), Two-Stage Least Squares. 2SLS is an IV method used for estimating single equations with endogeneity. It's applicable in systems where equations are over-identified. In a system of equations, you can use 2SLS equation by equation, provided each equation has enough instrumental variables. So 2SLS is definitely applicable for over-identified systems. So (iii) is correct.

IV (iv), Instrumental Variables method. IV is a broader class that includes techniques like 2SLS. So IV estimation is applicable here. Each equation in the system can be estimated using IV, provided there are valid instruments. So (iv) is applicable.

Wait, but the question is about systems of equations, not single equations. So maybe when we talk about IV in systems, we refer to methods like 3SLS (Three-Stage Least Squares) or FIML (Full Information Maximum Likelihood). But the question lists IV as an option, so I think IV as a general approach is applicable. So IV is another correct technique.

Wait, but the options are asking which are available. So for an over-identified system, you can use 2SLS on each equation if each equation is over-identified, or you can use IV methods. So (iii) and (iv) are correct.

Wait, but also I'm a bit confused about OLS. OLS is generally not suitable for simultaneous equations because of the endogeneity issue. Unless the system is exactly identified and you use a method like 2SLS, but for over-identified systems, OLS isn't applicable. So OLS (i) is not suitable here.

So the options available are iii) 2SLS and iv) IV. So looking at the answer choices, the correct ones would include both iii and iv.

Looking at the options, option J is (iii) and (iv) only. Option A is only (iii), which doesn't include IV. So the correct answer must be J.

Wait, but waitâ€”another thought. The question says "systems of simultaneous equations." So 2SLS is typically applied equation by equation, but for the entire system, sometimes other methods are used. But the question is about the available techniques, so 2SLS and IV are both applicable for estimating such systems, just maybe equation by equation.

So in the options, the correct choices are iii and iv, which is option J.

To determine which estimation techniques are available for over-identified systems of simultaneous equations, we analyze the suitability of each method:

1. **OLS (Ordinary Least Squares)**: OLS is primarily used for single-equation models and does not address endogeneity, which is a common issue in systems of simultaneous equations. It is not suitable for over-identified systems due to its inability to handle the complexities of such systems.

2. **ILS (Indirect Least Squares)**: ILS is applicable for just-identified systems, where it estimates the reduced form of the equations. However, it cannot handle over-identified systems because these systems have more restrictions than ILS can manage.

3. **2SLS (Two-Stage Least Squares)**: 2SLS is a widely used method for estimating single equations within over-identified systems. It addresses endogeneity by using instrumental variables and can be applied equation by equation in such systems, provided each equation has sufficient instruments.

4. **IV (Instrumental Variables)**: IV estimation is a broader class of methods that includes 2SLS. It is applicable for over-identified systems, as it relies on valid instruments to address endogeneity. Each equation in the system can be estimated using IV methods.

Based on this analysis, the techniques available for over-identified systems are **2SLS (iii)** and **IV (iv)**. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**J: (iii) and (iv) only.**
