Okay, so I've got this optics problem here about two thin lenses placed in front of each other. Hmm, I remember that when two lenses are placed close together, their powers add up, but wait, only if they're in contact or close enough that the separation is negligible compared to their focal lengths. But wait, in this case, they're not in contact. The first lens is placed 12.5 mm in front of the second. So I can't just add their diopters directly. I think I need to calculate the combined power considering that separation.

Wait, what's the formula for the combined power of two lenses separated by a distance d? Oh right, I think it's 1/f_total = 1/f1 + 1/f2 - d/(f1*f2), but wait, no, that's not quite right. Or wait, maybe it's (D1 + D2) - (D1 * D2 * t), where t is the separation in meters. Oh wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Each lens has a power D, which is 1/f in meters. So for lens 1, D1 is 5 diopters, so f1 is 0.2 meters (since 1/5 = 0.2 m, which is 200 mm). Similarly, D2 is 8 diopters, so f2 is 0.125 m (125 mm). The separation between the lenses is 12.5 mm, which is 0.0125 meters.

Now, the formula for the combined power when two lenses are separated by a distance t is D_total = D1 + D2 - D1*D2*t. Wait, or is it the other way around? Oh, wait, no, because the formula for the combined focal length when two lenses are separated by t is 1/f_total = 1/f1 + 1/f2 + (t)/(f1 f2). Or maybe I'm mixing up the sign. Let's think in terms of the lens formula.

Alternatively, the formula for the equivalent power is D_eq = D1 + D2 - D1*D2 * t, where t is the separation in meters. So let me plug in the numbers. D1 is 5, D2 is 8, t is 0.0125 m.

So D_eq = 5 + 8 - (5 * 8 * 0.0125). Let's calculate that. 5+8 is 13. Then 5*8 is 40, multiplied by 0.0125 is 0.5. So 13 - 0.5 is 12.5 diopters. Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have exactly 12.5 as the first option except option G. Wait, option G's first part is 12.5, but the other parts I'm not sure yet.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Because I've heard that the formula for the equivalent focal length when two lenses are separated by t is 1/f_eq = 1/f1 + 1/f2 + (t)/(f1 f2). So 1/f_eq = (1/0.2) + (1/0.125) + (0.0125)/(0.2*0.125).

Calculating each term: 1/0.2 is 5, 1/0.125 is 8, and 0.0125/(0.2*0.125) is 0.0125/(0.025) = 0.5. So adding them: 5 + 8 + 0.5 = 13.5. So 1/f_eq is 13.5, so f_eq is 1/13.5 ≈ 0.07407 meters, which is about 74.07 mm. Wait, but that would make the equivalent power 13.5 diopters. Hmm.

Wait, but the options don't have 13.5 as an option for part a except option C. Let me check the options again. Option C says 13.5 diopters for part a. So maybe that's correct. But wait, I thought the formula was D_eq = D1 + D2 - D1 D2 t. But perhaps I was wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, wait. Another approach: when you have two lenses separated by a distance t, the equivalent power D_eq is calculated as D1 + D2 - D1*D2*t. So that formula would give D_eq = 5 +8 - (5*8*0.0125). 5*8 is 40, 40 *0.0125 is 0.5. So D_eq would be 13 - 0.5 =12.5 diopters. But according to the other approach, it's 13.5. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the formula. Let me check the standard formula for two lenses separated by a distance t. The correct formula for the equivalent focal length is 1/f_eq = 1/f1 + 1/f2 + (t)/(f1 f2). So that's 1/f1 +1/f2 + t/(f1 f2). So with f1=0.2 m, f2=0.125 m, t=0.0125 m.

So 1/0.2 is 5, 1/0.125 is 8, and t/(f1 f2) is 0.0125/(0.2 * 0.125) = 0.0125 / 0.025 = 0.5. So 5 +8 +0.5 is 13.5. So 1/f_eq is 13.5, so f_eq is 1/13.5 ≈ 0.07407 m, which is 74.07 mm. So the equivalent power would be 13.5 diopters. So that would mean part a's answer is 13.5 diopters, which is option C's first part.

Wait, but let me think again. Because some sources say that the formula for equivalent power D is D = D1 + D2 - D1 D2 t, where t is the separation. Let me compute that: D1=5, D2=8, t=0.0125 m. So D=5+8 -5*8*0.0125 =13 - (40 * 0.0125)=13-0.5=12.5 diopters. So that would suggest D_eq is 12.5 diopters, which is option G's first part.

Hmm, conflicting approaches. Which one is correct?

Let me think about the derivation. The combined focal length can be found using the formula:

1/f = 1/f1 + 1/f2 + (d)/(f1 f2), where d is the separation between the lenses. So yes, that gives 1/f =5 +8 +0.5=13.5, so f=1/13.5 ≈0.07407 m. So the power is 13.5 diopters. So part a is 13.5 diopters, which matches option C.

So part a) is 13.5 diopters. So looking at the options:

Option C: 13.5 diopters.

So let's move to part b), the true focal length. Since the equivalent power is 13.5 diopters, the focal length is 1/13.5 meters, which is approximately 0.07407 meters, which is 74.07 mm, or 7.4 cm. So part b would be 7.4 cm, which matches option C's second value.

Now part c) asks for the position of the two principal points. Hmm, the principal points are where the principal planes intersect the optical axis. For a combination of two lenses, the principal points can be found using some formulas. Alternatively, the location of the principal points relative to each lens can be determined.

Wait, I think the first principal point (P1) is located at a distance of (D2 * t)/(D1 + D2 - D1 D2 t) from the first lens. Similarly, the second principal point (P2) is located at a distance of (D1 * t)/(D1 + D2 - D1 D2 t) from the second lens. Or maybe I have that reversed. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: The principal points can be found using the formula for the position relative to each lens.

The distance from the first lens to the first principal point (P1) is given by (D2 * t) / (D1 + D2 - D1 D2 t). Similarly, the distance from the second lens to the second principal point (P2) is (D1 * t) / (D1 + D2 - D1 D2 t).

Wait, let me check that formula. Alternatively, the principal points can be found using:

The first principal point is at a distance of (D2 * (t)) / (D1 + D2 - D1 D2 t) from the first lens. Similarly, the second principal point is at a distance of (D1 * (t)) / (D1 + D2 - D1 D2 t) from the second lens.

Wait, let me plug in the numbers. D1=5, D2=8, t=0.0125 m.

D_eq = D1 + D2 - D1 D2 t =5+8 -5*8*0.0125 =13 -0.5=12.5 diopters.

So the denominator is 12.5.

So the distance from the first lens to P1 is (D2 * t) / (D_total) = (8 * 0.0125) / 12.5. Let's compute that. 8 *0.0125 is 0.1 m. 0.1 divided by 12.5 is 0.008 m, which is 8 mm.

Similarly, the distance from the second lens to P2 is (D1 * t) / D_total = (5 *0.0125)/12.5 =0.0625 /12.5 =0.005 m =5 mm.

Wait, but wait, the calculation gives P1 at 8 mm from the first lens, towards the second lens. Similarly, P2 is 5 mm from the second lens, towards the first lens. But I'm a bit confused about the signs. Alternatively, perhaps P1 is located 8 mm to the left of the first lens, and P2 is 5 mm to the right of the second lens. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, no, in the formula, when the lenses are placed with a separation t, the first principal point is on the object side of the first lens, and the second principal point is on the image side of the second lens.

Wait, but the distances we calculated are from the respective lenses. So P1 is 8 mm in front of the first lens (because the formula gives the position as measured from the first lens towards the object side), and P2 is 5 mm behind the second lens (on the image side). So the principal points are 8 mm in front of first lens, and 5 mm behind the second.

But let me make sure. Let's think of the two lenses arranged along the optical axis. The first lens is at position 0, the second at position +12.5 mm. The first principal point (P1) is at position -8 mm (8 mm to the left of first lens). The second principal point (P2) is at position 12.5 mm +5 mm =17.5 mm (5 mm to the right of the second lens). So the positions are P1 at -8 mm and P2 at +17.5 mm relative to the first lens. Wait, but the question asks for the position of the two principal points. So perhaps the answer would state that the first principal point is 8 mm in front of the first lens, and the second is 5 mm behind the second lens. So the options should reflect that.

Looking at option C, part c) says 5 mm and -8 mm. Wait, perhaps the positions are given relative to each lens, so for the first lens, P1 is 5 mm in front, and for the second lens, P2 is 8 mm behind. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, in the calculations I did earlier, I found that P1 is 8 mm from the first lens towards the object side (so in front of the first lens), and P2 is 5 mm from the second lens towards the image side (so behind the second lens). So the positions are 8 mm in front of the first, and 5 mm behind the second. So in the options, part c) would be 8 mm and 5 mm. But looking at option C, part c says 5 mm and -8 mm. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the signs are opposite. Let's think again. The formula for the first principal point distance from the first lens is (D2 t)/(D_total). So 8*0.0125 /12.5 =0.008 m, which is 8 mm. So P1 is 8 mm in front of the first lens. The second principal point is (D1 t)/D_total =5*0.0125 /12.5=0.005 m, 5 mm behind the second lens. So when considering their positions relative to each lens, P1 is +8 mm from first lens, P2 is +5 mm from the second lens (since behind is positive direction). So part c) in the options would list P1 as 8 mm and P2 as 5 mm, but looking at the options, I don't see that.

Wait, let's check the options again. Option C says for part c) 5 mm and -8 mm. Hmm, that's the opposite of what I have. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for P1 is (D2 * t)/(D1 + D2 - D1 D2 t). Which would be 8*0.0125 /12.5 =0.008 m=8 mm. So P1 is 8 mm in front of the first lens. Similarly, P2 is (D1 * t)/(D_total)=5*0.0125/12.5=0.005 m=5 mm. So P2 is 5 mm behind the second lens.

Wait, perhaps in the options, the positions are given as the distance from each lens, with sign conventions. So from the first lens, P1 is at +8 mm (since it's in front), and from the second lens, P2 is at +5 mm (since it's behind). But in the options, part c) for option C is 5 mm and -8 mm. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding how they're being presented.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the position relative to each lens, but the signs are opposite. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's move on to part d) and see if that can help clarify.

Part d) asks for the distance of the posterior focal point from the second lens, and the anterior focal point from the first lens. Wait, the focal points are located at the focal length from the principal points. So the posterior focal point is the rear focal point, which is behind the second principal point. Similarly, the anterior focal point is in front of the first principal point.

Wait, the combined focal length is 74.07 mm, so the anterior focal point is 74.07 mm in front of the first principal point. Since the first principal point is 8 mm in front of the first lens, the anterior focal point would be 74.07 mm in front of P1, which is 74.07 +8 mm =82.07 mm in front of the first lens. But wait, the question is about the distance from the first lens to its anterior focal point. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing this up.

Wait, no. The focal points are located at a distance equal to the equivalent focal length from their respective principal points. So the anterior focal point (FA) is located at f_eq in front of P1, and the posterior focal point (FP) is located at f_eq behind P2.

So FA is at P1 minus f_eq, and FP is at P2 plus f_eq. Since P1 is 8 mm in front of the first lens, FA would be 8 mm + f_eq. Wait, no, because if P1 is 8 mm in front of the first lens, then moving f_eq in front of P1 would be 8 mm + f_eq. Similarly, P2 is 5 mm behind the second lens, so FP would be 5 mm + f_eq (since f_eq is behind P2). Wait, but f_eq is the total focal length.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the positions relative to each lens. The first lens is at position 0, second lens at +12.5 mm.

P1 is at -8 mm (8 mm in front of first lens).

FA is at P1 - f_eq. Since f_eq is 74.07 mm, FA would be at (-8 mm) -74.07 mm =-82.07 mm relative to the first lens. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps FA is f_eq in front of P1, so P1 is at -8 mm, so FA would be at -8 mm -74.07 mm= -82.07 mm. Which is 82.07 mm in front of the first lens.

Similarly, FP is at P2 + f_eq. P2 is at 12.5 +5=17.5 mm relative to the first lens. So FP is at 17.5 mm +74.07 mm=91.57 mm relative to the first lens, which is 91.57 -12.5=79.07 mm behind the second lens.

Wait, but the question asks for the distance of the posterior focal point from the second lens (FP). So from the second lens at 12.5 mm, FP is at 91.57 mm, so the distance is 91.57 -12.5=79.07 mm, which is approximately 79.1 mm. But none of the options have that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. The focal points of the combination are located at a distance f_eq from the principal points. So for the posterior focal point, it's f_eq behind the second principal point. The second principal point is 5 mm behind the second lens. So the posterior focal point is 5 mm + f_eq (74.07 mm) =79.07 mm behind the second lens. So that's 79.07 mm, which is approximately 79.1 mm.

Wait, but looking at the options, part d) for option C says 10 cm and 4.2 mm. Hmm, but I
