Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here about triangle RST. Let me try to visualize it first. The points are X on RS, Y on RT, and Z on ST. They mention that XY and XZ are midsegments of triangle RST. Hmm, midsegments... I remember that a midsegment in a triangle is a segment that connects the midpoints of two sides. And importantly, a midsegment is parallel to the third side and half as long.

Wait, so if XY and XZ are midsegments, that means they each connect midpoints. So, for XY to be a midsegment, it should connect the midpoints of RS and RT. Or wait, let me think again. No, actually, each midsegment connects the midpoints of two sides, so XY would connect midpoints of RS and RT, making it parallel to ST. Similarly, XZ connects midpoints of RS and ST, making it parallel to RT.

But wait, in this problem, X is on RS, Y is on RT, and Z is on ST. So, for XY to be a midsegment, X must be the midpoint of RS and Y the midpoint of RT. Similarly, XZ must be a midsegment, so X is the midpoint of RS and Z the midpoint of ST. So yes, that makes sense.

So, if that's the case, then RX = XS, RY = YT, and SZ = ZT. Because X, Y, Z are midpoints.

Now, the problem gives me the length of XY as 7. Since XY is a midsegment, it's parallel to ST and half its length. So ST should be twice 7, which is 14. Because midsegment length is half the third side.

Wait, but the problem says the length of RT is 13. Wait, RT is another side of the triangle. Let me try to draw this.

Triangle RST, with R at the top, S on the left, and T on the right. X is the midpoint of RS, Y the midpoint of RT, and Z the midpoint of ST. So XY connects X and Y, and since it's a midsegment, it's parallel to ST, and its length is 7, so ST is 14.

But wait, RT is given as 13. So RT is one of the sides, and RT is 13. Hmm.

The problem also says the measure of angle YXZ is 124 degrees. So angle at point X, between points Y and Z. Let me think about triangle YXZ. Y is on RT, X on RS, and Z on ST. So triangle YXZ is inside triangle RST.

Since XY and XZ are midsegments, YXZ is a smaller triangle formed by connecting these midpoints. Wait, but midsegments create a medial triangle, which is similar to the original triangle with a ratio of 1:2.

Wait, the medial triangle connects all three midpoints, so that would be triangle XYZ in this case. So triangle XYZ is similar to triangle RST, scaled down by 1/2.

So, the angles in triangle XYZ should be equal to the corresponding angles in triangle RST. Because similar triangles have equal corresponding angles.

So, angle YXZ in triangle XYZ corresponds to which angle in triangle RST? Let's see. In triangle RST, the corresponding angle to angle YXZ would be the angle at point S, because in the medial triangle XYZ, point X corresponds to point R, Y to S, and Z to T? Wait, maybe I should map the points correctly.

Wait, no. Let's think again. The medial triangle connects midpoints, so in this case:

- Point X is the midpoint of RS.

- Point Y is the midpoint of RT.

- Point Z is the midpoint of ST.

So, when you connect XY, YZ, and ZX, you form the medial triangle. So, the medial triangle is XYZ, which is similar to RST with a ratio of 1/2.

In the medial triangle, each vertex corresponds to the midpoint of the sides of the original triangle. So the angles in the medial triangle XYZ correspond to the angles in RST.

So, angle at X in XYZ (which is angle YXZ) corresponds to angle at R in RST. Because point X is the midpoint of RS, Y is the midpoint of RT, so the lines XY and XZ are midsegments. So angle YXZ is equal to angle RST?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think about the correspondence. In the original triangle RST, the angles are at R, S, and T. The medial triangle XYZ has angles at X, Y, Z. So the angle at X in XYZ corresponds to the angle at R in RST. Because X is the midpoint of RS, so line RX is half of RS. Similarly, the other points.

So, angle YXZ is the angle at X in triangle XYZ, which corresponds to angle R in triangle RST. So angle YXZ is equal to angle R.

Wait, but the problem states that angle YXZ is 124 degrees. So that would mean angle R is 124 degrees.

Wait, but the question is asking for the measure of angle RYX. Let me see. Point R is a vertex of triangle RST. Point Y is the midpoint of RT, and point X is the midpoint of RS.

So, angle RYX is the angle at Y between points R and X. So angle at Y, between R and X.

Wait, let's clarify. RYX is the angle at Y formed by points R, Y, X.

Wait, R is connected to Y (midpoint of RT), and Y is connected to X (midpoint of RS). So, RYX is the angle at Y between RY and XY.

Wait, but XY is a midsegment, which is parallel to ST. So, XY is parallel to ST, and RY is part of RT. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe triangle RYX can be considered. Since Y is the midpoint of RT, and X is the midpoint of RS, then RY is half of RT, and RX is half of RS. So, in triangle RYX, sides RY and RX are midlines.

Wait, maybe I can think of triangle RST. Since Y is the midpoint of RT and X is the midpoint of RS, then segment XY is a midsegment of triangle RST, which we already know is parallel to ST and half its length.

So, in triangle RST, angle at S is opposite side RT, which is 13. Hmm. Wait, maybe I should use the Law of Sines or Cosines.

Wait, but I know angle YXZ is 124 degrees, which equals angle R in triangle RST. Because the medial triangle's angle at X equals the original's angle at R.

Wait, but wait, maybe I got that wrong. Because in the medial triangle XYZ, angle at X is formed by segments XY and XZ. Which correspond to the midsegments, which are parallel to ST and RT.

Wait, since XY is parallel to ST, and XZ is parallel to RT, because they're midsegments. So, angle YXZ is formed by two lines that are parallel to ST and RT. So, the angle between XY and XZ is equal to the angle between ST and RT in the original triangle. Wait, no. Because XY is parallel to ST, and XZ is parallel to RT. So, the angle between XY and XZ should be equal to the angle between ST and RT. Because parallel lines maintain the same angles.

Wait, the angle between ST and RT is at point T. So, angle STR. Because ST and RT meet at T.

Wait, but angle YXZ is the angle between XY and XZ, which are parallel to ST and RT, respectively. So, the angle between XY and XZ would be equal to the angle between ST and RT, which is angle at T in triangle RST.

Wait, but the problem says angle YXZ is 124 degrees. So, angle at T is 124 degrees.

Wait, but earlier I thought angle YXZ corresponds to angle R. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there.

Let me try to think differently. Since XY is parallel to ST, and XZ is parallel to RT, then the angle between XY and XZ (angle YXZ) is equal to the angle between ST and RT, which is angle at T.

So, angle YXZ (124 degrees) is equal to angle STR (angle T) in triangle RST.

So, angle T is 124 degrees.

Now, the question is to find the measure of angle RYX.

Angle RYX is at point Y, between points R, Y, X.

Hmm. Let me try to find triangle RYX. Points R, Y, X.

RY is half of RT because Y is the midpoint. Similarly, RX is half of RS. But I don't know RS's length. Wait, but maybe I can find some relations.

Since RT is 13, then RY is 13/2 = 6.5.

Similarly, RS is another side, which I don't know the length of. Let's call RS = a, so RX = a/2.

But without knowing the lengths, perhaps I can find the angles using properties of midsegments and parallel lines.

Wait, XY is a midsegment, so it's parallel to ST. Since XY is parallel to ST, then the corresponding angles where a transversal crosses them would be equal.

Looking at point Y, which is on RT. Let's consider line RY.

Wait, maybe I can find some similar triangles.

Alternatively, since XY is parallel to ST, then the angle between XY and RY is equal to the angle between ST and RT.

Wait, angle at Y, between RY and XY.

RY is part of RT, and XY is parallel to ST.

So, the angle between XY and RY would be equal to the angle between ST and RT, because they are corresponding angles due to the parallel lines.

Wait, but angle between XY and RY at Y is the same as angle between ST and RT at T, which is 124 degrees. So angle RYX (which is the angle between RY and XY at Y) is 124 degrees?

Wait, no. Wait, let me think again. XY is parallel to ST. So, when you have a transversal RY cutting them, the corresponding angles would be equal.

So, the angle between XY and RY (at Y) is equal to the angle between ST and RT (at T). So angle RYX is equal to angle STR, which is 124 degrees. So, angle RYX is 124 degrees.

Wait, but that's option A. But I thought angle T was 124 degrees, and angle RYX equals angle T.

But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because if XY is parallel to ST, then the angle formed by RY (a transversal) with XY would be equal to the angle it makes with ST. So, angle RYX (which is the angle between RY and XY) should be equal to angle STR (which is angle T, 124 degrees).

So, that would make angle RYX 124 degrees, which is option A.

But wait, another approach: since triangle XYZ is the medial triangle, and in triangle XYZ, angle at X is 124 degrees, which equals angle R in triangle RST.

Wait, earlier I thought that angle YXZ corresponds to angle R, but now I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

In the medial triangle XYZ, each angle corresponds to the original triangle's angles. So, angle at X corresponds to angle R, angle at Y corresponds to angle S, and angle at Z corresponds to angle T.

So, angle YXZ is at X, so it's equal to angle R. So, angle R is 124 degrees.

But then earlier, using the parallel lines, I thought angle RYX is 124 degrees. So, is angle RYX equal to angle R?

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think about triangle RYX.

In triangle RYX, RY is a side, YX is another side, and RX is the third side.

Wait, RY is half of RT (6.5), YX is 7, and RX is half of RS.

But I don't know RS's length. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps triangle RYX is similar to triangle RST in some way.

Wait, since XY is a midsegment, it's parallel to ST. So, in triangle RST, line XY connects midpoints of RS and RT, creating a smaller similar triangle.

Wait, but triangle RYX is not necessarily similar to any other triangle unless certain conditions are met.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Law of Sines in triangle RYX.

In triangle RYX, I have side YX =7, RY=6.5. Let me denote angle at Y as angle RYX, which is what we're looking for.

Wait, but I don't know any angles in triangle RYX except perhaps some relations from the larger triangle.

Wait, since XY is parallel to ST, then the angle between XY and RX is equal to the angle between ST and RS.

Because when a transversal crosses parallel lines, the corresponding angles are equal.

So, in triangle RST, angle between ST and RS is angle at S. So, angle S.

In triangle RYX, the angle between XY and RX is at X, which is angle YXR. Since XY is parallel to ST, the angle YXR equals angle S.

Hmm. But I'm trying to find angle RYX, which is at Y.

So, perhaps I can find other angles in triangle RYX.

Wait, triangle RYX has sides RY=6.5, YX=7, and RX= (RS)/2. But I don't know RS.

Wait, but earlier, from the midsegments, we found that ST is 14. Because XY is a midsegment and is 7, so ST is 14.

We also know RT is 13.

So, in triangle RST, sides RT=13, ST=14, and RS is unknown.

We can use the Law of Cosines in triangle RST to find RS, since we know two sides and the included angle.

Wait, because in triangle RST, angle at T is 124 degrees (from earlier conclusion), sides RT=13, ST=14, and RS is unknown.

So, applying Law of Cosines on triangle RST at angle T:

RS² = RT² + ST² - 2*(RT)*(ST)*cos(angle T)

So,

RS² = 13² +14² - 2*13*14*cos(124°)

Calculating that:

13²=169, 14²=196. 2*13*14= 364.

So,

RS² = 169 + 196 - 364 * cos(124°)

cos(124°) is negative because 124 is in the second quadrant.

cos(124) ≈ cos(180-56)= -cos(56) ≈ -0.5592

So,

RS² ≈ 365 - 364*(-0.5592) = 365 + 364*(0.5592)

Calculate 364 * 0.5592:

Approximately 364 * 0.5 = 182

364 * 0.0592 ≈ 364 * 0.06 ≈ 21.84, so total about 182 +21.84= 203.84

So,

RS² ≈ 365 + 203.84 = 568.84

So RS ≈ sqrt(568.84) ≈ 23.85

So RS is approximately 23.85, so RX is half of that, about 11.925.

Now, in triangle RYX, we have:

RY = 6.5, YX=7, RX≈11.925.

We can apply the Law of Cosines to find angle RYX.

Law of Cosines: angle at Y.

cos(angle RYX) = (RY² + YX² - RX²) / (2 * RY * YX)

Plugging the values:

RY² = 6.5²=42.25

YX²=49

RX²≈ (11.925)^2 ≈ 142.26

So,

cos(angle RYX) = (42.25 +49 -142.26) / (2 *6.5 *7)

Calculate numerator: 42.25 +49=91.25; 91.25-142.26 = -51.01

Denominator: 2*6.5*7=91

So,

cos(angle RYX) = (-51.01)/91 ≈ -0.560

So, angle RYX ≈ arccos(-0.560) ≈ 124 degrees.

Wait, that's the same as angle YXZ. So, angle RYX is 124 degrees. Which would be option A.

But wait, earlier I thought angle YXZ corresponds to angle R, making angle R 124 degrees. Then, using the Law of Cosines in triangle RYX, I find that angle RYX is also 124 degrees.

But is that correct? Because triangle RYX has angle at Y of 124 degrees, which is the same as angle R in the original triangle.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, in triangle RYX, the sides are:

RY = 6.5, YX=7, RX= approx 11.925.

Wait, but RX is 11.925, which is longer than RY and YX. So, the largest side is RX, which is opposite the largest angle. So, the angle opposite RX is angle Y, which is angle RYX. So, that angle would be larger than the others.

Wait, but with the calculation, I found angle RYX is 124 degrees, which is obtuse. So, that makes sense because the side opposite is the largest.

So, according to this, angle RYX is 124 degrees, which is option A.

But wait, another approach: since XY is parallel to ST, then the angle between XY and RY is equal to the angle between ST and RT, which is angle at T, which we found to be 124 degrees. So, angle RYX is 124 degrees.

So, both methods lead to the same conclusion. So, the answer should be A: 124 degrees.

In triangle RST, points X, Y, and Z are midpoints of sides RS, RT, and ST, respectively. Segments XY and XZ are midsegments, meaning they are parallel to ST and RT, respectively, and half their lengths. The problem states that XY = 7, RT = 13, and angle YXZ = 124°. The goal is to find the measure of angle RYX.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Midsegments and Parallelism**:  
   - Since XY is a midsegment, it is parallel to ST and half its length. Thus, ST = 2 * XY = 14.
