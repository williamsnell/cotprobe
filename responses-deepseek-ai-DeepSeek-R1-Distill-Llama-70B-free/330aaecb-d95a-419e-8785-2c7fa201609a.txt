Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about a deed and who gets the proceeds from the wheat crop. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the deed was executed by a woman in 2001. She conveyed land for $1, which was acknowledged. The terms are a bit tricky. She says it's "to my friend for life, but if liquor is ever sold on the tract, then to my cousin and his heirs." There's also a part where if the cousin's interest isn't valid, she reserves the right to re-enter and take back the property.

So, I'm thinking this is a life estate scenario. The friend gets a life estate, and the cousin has a future interest, probably a contingent remainder. The condition is that if liquor is sold, the property goes to the cousin. If that doesn't happen, maybe it reverts back to the woman or her heirs under the reserved right.

Now, the friend died intestate in 2004 before the wheat he planted could be harvested. The question is who gets the proceeds from the crop.

I remember that when a life tenant dies, their interest ends, and the future interest becomes possessory. But wait, the friend was the life tenant, right? So upon his death, the next interest in the property would take effect. But the condition about selling liquor hasn't happened yet. So the cousin's interest hasn't vested because the condition hasn't occurred.

But wait, the friend died before the wheat was harvested. Who gets the crops? I think the rule is that the life tenant is entitled to the crops planted during their tenancy, even if they die before harvest. The idea is that the life tenant has the right to the fruits of the land during their life, and that includes the right to the crops they planted.

So even though the friend died, the crops were planted while he was alive. Therefore, his estate should be entitled to the proceeds. Because the life tenant's interest includes the right to use the land and collect income from it during their life, including the crops planted.

Wait, but does the friend's death change anything? I think the proceeds from the crops would go to the friend's estate. Because the life tenant's rights don't survive them, but the fruits (crops) are considered part of their estate. So the proceeds would go to the friend's heirs or next of kin, depending on intestacy laws.

Looking at the options, option I says the friend's heirs. Option H is the friend's next of kin. Wait, but in intestacy, the estate goes to heirs, which may be the same as next of kin. So I think I is the right choice.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, the crops are considered part of the real property, and upon the life tenant's death, the remainderman gets the right to them. But no, I think the life tenant is entitled to the crops planted during their tenancy. So the proceeds should go to the friend's estate, which would be his heirs.

So the answer should be I: The friend's heirs.

The deed conveyed a life estate to the friend, with a contingent remainder to the cousin if liquor was sold on the land. The woman also reserved a right of re-entry if the cousin's interest was invalid. However, the critical issue is the disposition of the wheat crop planted by the friend before his death.

Under property law, a life tenant is entitled to the fruits of the land, including crops planted during their tenancy, even if they die before the harvest. These rights are part of the life estate and do not automatically transfer to the remainderman. Instead, the proceeds from the crops would pass to the life tenant's estate upon their death.

Since the friend died intestate, their estate, including the proceeds from the wheat, would be distributed according to intestacy laws. This would typically mean the proceeds go to the friend's heirs. Therefore, the correct answer is:

I: The friend's heirs.

Answer: I
