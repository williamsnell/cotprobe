Okay, so I have this question about bystander intervention, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me think through what I remember about this topic.

I recall that there's something called the bystander effect, which says that the more people present in an emergency, the less likely any one person is to help. But wait, I should make sure I'm not mixing up the details. So, the bystander effect suggests that when more people are around, each individual feels less responsible to act. Like, if someone else is there, they might think someone else will handle it.

So the question is asking, when is a person in an emergency most likely to receive help? The options are numbers from one to ten, so I think the idea is that fewer bystanders mean more help.

Wait, I think the classic study was the Kitty Genovese case. She was attacked, and although many people heard her screams, few called for help. The more people around, the less likely someone would step in because of diffusion of responsibility. So the chances of help increase when there are fewer people.

So if the number of bystanders is smaller, the individual is more likely to get help. So the best scenario is when there's only one bystander. Because with one person, they can't diffuse responsibility to others. They feel more accountable.

Looking at the options, option E is one. So the correct answer should be E.

But wait, I should double-check. Is it possible that having some others could help, maybe if someone takes charge? Or is it strictly that fewer people are better?

Well, the bystander effect is strongest when there's a larger group. So a single bystander would mean the highest likelihood of help. So yes, the answer is E: one.

The bystander effect indicates that the likelihood of an individual receiving help in an emergency decreases as the number of bystanders increases. This is due to diffusion of responsibility, where each person assumes someone else will take action. Conversely, when there is only one bystander, the individual feels more accountable and is more likely to provide help. Therefore, the person in an emergency is most likely to receive help when there is only one bystander.

Answer: E
