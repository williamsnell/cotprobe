Okay, so I have this question about Treasury bills and interest rates. Hmm, I remember that Treasury bills are short-term government securities, right? They're sold at a discount and mature at face value. So the profit is the difference between the purchase price and the face value. 

The question says I buy a 91-day $500,000 Treasury bill for $485,000 and hold it until maturity. I need to find the interest rate I earn. 

Wait, how do I calculate the interest rate for a T-bill? Oh right, I think it's based on the discount. The formula comes to mind. I think it's something like (Face Value - Purchase Price) / Purchase Price * (360 / Days to Maturity). Wait, is that correct? Or is it (Face Value - Purchase Price) / Face Value? No, wait, I'm getting confused between different yield calculations. 

Wait, there are a couple of methods. The bank discount yield uses the formula (D / F) * (360 / t), where D is the discount, F is the face value, and t is the days to maturity. But I'm not sure if that's the interest rate the question is asking for. Alternatively, the money market yield is (D / P) * (360 / t), where P is the purchase price. Or is it (F - P)/P * (360/t)? 

Wait, let me get this straight. The interest earned is the difference between face value and purchase price. So here, that's $500,000 - $485,000 = $15,000. So the interest is $15,000 over 91 days. 

To find the yield, I think there are two common measures: the bank discount yield and the money market yield. The bank discount yield is usually used for T-bills, I believe. The formula for bank discount yield is (D / F) * (360 / t). So D is $15,000, F is $500,000, t is 91 days. Plugging in: (15000/500000) * (360/91) = ?

Calculating that: 15000/500000 is 0.03. 360/91 is approximately 3.956. So 0.03 * 3.956 is about 0.1187, which is 11.87%. Looking at the options, I see that option I is 11.8%, which is close. 

Wait, but sometimes people might calculate it differently. Let me make sure. Alternatively, the simple interest formula is I = P * r * t. But since it's a discount instrument, maybe the formula is (F - P)/P * (360/t). Let's try that. (15000/485000) * (360/91). 

15000/485000 is approximately 0.0309278. 360/91 is around 3.956. Multiply them: 0.0309278 * 3.956 ≈ 0.1223, which is about 12.23%. Hmm, that's not one of the options. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the formulas. 

Wait, the bank discount yield is (D/F)*(360/t). So D is 15,000, F is 500,000. So 15,000/500,000 = 0.03. 360/91 is about 3.956. 0.03 * 3.956 = approximately 0.11868, which is 11.868%, so about 11.87%. The closest option is I: 11.8%. But another option is G:12%, which is not too far. 

Alternatively, the question might be asking for the effective annual rate, which would be different. Or maybe it's using simple interest without the 360-day convention. Let me try another approach. 

The holding period yield is (F - P)/P. So 15,000 /485,000 is about 0.0309, or 3.09%. But that's the yield over 91 days. To annualize it, multiply by 4 (since 91 is about a quarter of a year). 3.09% *4 is 12.36%, which is approximately 12.4%. But that's not one of the options either. 

Wait, maybe the correct approach is using the bank discount formula. So 11.87%, which would round to 11.9%, but the option is 11.8% (option I), or perhaps 12% is an approximate. Alternatively, maybe the exact calculation is needed. Let me compute it more precisely. 

So D is 15,000. F is 500,000. 15,000 /500,000 = 0.03 exactly. 360 divided by 91 is 360/91 = approximately 3.956043. So 0.03 * 3.956043 = 0.1186813, which is 11.868%. Rounded to one decimal, 11.9%, but the options don't have that. The closest is I:11.8% or perhaps J:10%. Wait, that's too low. Alternatively, maybe the question uses a 365-day year? Let me see. 

If using 365 days, then it's (15,000/500,000)*(365/91). 365/91 is about 4.01099. 0.03 *4.01099 = 0.1203, so 12.03%. Now, looking at the options, G is 12%, H is 13%, so 12.03 would be closer to 12%. So if the question uses a 365-day count, the answer would be approximately 12%, which is option G. But I thought Treasury bills usually use 360 days for calculations. 

I'm a bit confused now. Which day count convention is correct here? For Treasury bills, I think the standard is the bank discount yield, which uses 360 days. So in that case, the earlier calculation of ~11.87% would be correct, which is option I (11.8%). But none of the options exactly match. Wait, let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: 10.4%

B: 12.5%

C:9.5%

D:15%

E:8.3%

F:14.2%

G:12%

H:13%

I:11.8%

J:10%

So 11.87% is closest to I:11.8%. So the correct answer would be I. 

But wait, another approach: the interest is 15,000 over 91 days. So the rate per day is 15,000 /91 ≈ 164.835 dollars per day. Then annualized would be 164.835 * 365 ≈ 60,136. So the annual interest is $60,136. The rate would be (60136 /485000)*100. 60136 /485000 is approximately 0.124, which is 12.4%. Hmm, but that's not matching the earlier method. 

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the yield on a Treasury bill. The correct formula for the yield is (Face - Price) / Price * (360 / Days). So that's (15,000 /485,000) * (360 /91).

Let me compute that exactly. 15,000 divided by 485,000 is 0.030927835. Multiply by (360/91) which is approximately 3.956043. So 0.030927835 *3.956043 = 0.1223, which is 12.23%. But that's higher than any option except B (12.5%) and F (14.2%). None of the options match 12.23%. 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me calculate 360/91 accurately. 91 times 3 is 273, 360-273=87. So 3 + 87/91. 87/91 is approximately 0.956. So 3.956. 

Wait, but perhaps the formula using 360 is (D / (F - D)) * (360 / t), but no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the formula is as I thought before. So perhaps the question is expecting the simple interest rate, which would be (15,000 /485,000) * (365/91). Let me compute that.

365/91 is exactly 4.010989. So 0.0309278 *4.010989 ≈ 0.124, which is 12.4%. Again, not matching any option. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is just using (15,000 /485,000) *100 to get the percentage, but that's only 3.09%, which is way too low. But that's not annualized. 

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the simple interest rate without annualizing. So 15,000 over 91 days on 485,000. So the rate would be (15,000 /485,000) * (365/91) *100. Which is as before, around 12.4%. But that's not an option. Hmm. 

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try another approach. The interest is $15,000 over 91 days. The annual equivalent would be 15,000 * (365/91). Let's compute 365/91: that's 4.010989. So 15,000 *4.010989 = 60,164. So the annual interest would be $60,164. The yield is (60164 /485,000)*100. 60164 divided by 485,000 is 0.124, so 12.4%. Again, not matching any option. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the rate using 360 days in the denominator. So the annual interest would be 15,000 * (360/91) = 15,000 * 3.956 = 59,340. Then the yield is 59,340 /485,000 = 0.1223, which is 12.23%. Still not matching any option. 

Wait, looking back at the options, option G is 12%. That's close to 12.23%. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the discount yield formula, which is (D/F) * (360/t). So D is 15,000, F is 500,000. So 15,000/500,000 is 0.03. 360/91 is 3.956. So 0.03 *3.956=0.11868, which is 11.868%, so 11.87%, which is option I:11.8%. 

Wait, but why is the formula using F instead of P? Because the discount is based on the face value. So yes, the bank discount yield uses face value. So the correct answer is 11.8%, option I. 

But I'm a bit confused because when I calculated using the price, I got 12.23%, which isn't an option. So perhaps the intended formula is the bank discount yield, which uses F. 

So the correct calculation is (15000/500000)*(360/91) = 0.03 *3.956=0.11868, which is 11.868%, so 11.9% approximately, but the closest option is I:11.8%. 

Therefore, the answer should be I.

To determine the interest rate earned on a 91-day $500,000 Treasury bill purchased at $485,000 and held until maturity, we calculate the yield using the bank discount yield formula. The bank discount yield is given by:

\[
\text{Yield} = \left(\frac{D}{F}\right) \times \left(\frac{360}{t}\right)
\]

Where:
- \(D = \text{Discount} = F - P = 500,000 - 485,000 = 15,000\)
- \(F = \text{Face Value} = 500,000\)
- \(t = \text{Days to Maturity} = 91\)

Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Yield} = \left(\frac{15,000}{500,000}\right) \times \left(\frac{360}{91}\right)
\]

First, calculate \(D/F\):
\[
\frac{15,000}{500,000} = 0.03
\]

Next, calculate \(360/t\):
\[
\frac{360}{91} \approx 3.956
\]

Now, multiply the two results:
\[
0.03 \times 3.956 \approx 0.1187 \, \text{or} \, 11.87\%
\]

The closest option to 11.87% is **11.8%**, which corresponds to option **I**.
