Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here about a piston and cylinder arrangement. Let me try to understand what's being asked. Hmm, the setup is that initially, the volume is 1.5 cubic feet, and the air is at 400 psia. Then the air expands reversibly at a constant temperature of 85°F, and the final volume is 4 cubic feet. They want to find the work and heat transferred during this process, and the options are given as A to D, with the answers ranging from about 95 to 120 Btu.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Wait, the process is at constant temperature, so it's an isothermal process. Oh right, for an isothermal process in an ideal gas, the work done can be calculated using the formula W = nRT ln(V2/V1), but wait, since it's air, maybe we can treat it as an ideal gas here.

Alternatively, there's another formula involving pressure and volume. Oh right, the work done in an isothermal process is also given by W = P1 V1 ln(V2/V1) when using appropriate units. But wait, I need to make sure about the units here because the given pressure is in psia and volume is in cubic feet.

Wait, let's think about the ideal gas law: PV = nRT. So for an isothermal process, the work done is the integral of P dV from V1 to V2. Since T is constant, P = nRT/V, so substituting that into the integral gives W = nRT ln(V2/V1). But I don't know the number of moles here, so maybe I can express it using the initial conditions.

Alternatively, using P1 V1 = n R T1 and since T is constant, P2 V2 = n R T, same as P1 V1. So n R T = P1 V1. So substituting into the work equation: W = P1 V1 ln(V2/V1). But wait, I have to make sure that the units are consistent because P is in psia and V in cubic feet. The gas constant R is in certain units, but I'm not sure. Wait, let me check the units.

Wait, another approach: The formula for work in an isothermal process for an ideal gas is W = P1 V1 ln(V2/V1) when P is in absolute units and V is in consistent volume units, but I think in this case, since P is given in psia and V in cubic feet, I might need to convert psia to psfa or maybe use a different value for R.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the units. The ideal gas equation in English units is often written as PV = nRT, where P is in psfa (pound-force per square inch absolute), R is the gas constant for air, which is about 53.35 ft·lb_f/(lb_mol·R). But wait, work is in foot-pounds or Btu. Since 1 Btu is approximately 778 ft·lb_f. So maybe I should calculate the work in ft·lb_f and then convert to Btu.

Alternatively, another formula I've come across is W = P1 V1 ln(V2/V1), but this is when P is in psia, V is in cubic feet, and the result would be in (ft·lb_f). Because 1 psia * 1 ft^3 equals 1 (lb_f·in^3 * ft^3)/(in^3 * lb_f) )... Wait, maybe that's confusing. Let me think again.

Wait, let's be precise. Let me recall that 1 psia is 1 lbf per square inch. 1 cubic foot is 12 inches by 12 inches by 12 inches, which is 1728 cubic inches. So 1 ft^3 is 1728 in^3. Therefore, 1 psia * 1 ft^3 = 1 lbf/in² * 1728 in³ = 1728 lbf·in. To convert this to ft·lb_f, since 1 foot is 12 inches, 1 ft·lb_f is 12 in·lb_f. So 1728 in·lb_f is 1728 / 12 = 144 ft·lb_f. So 1 psia*ft^3 is 144 ft·lb_f.

Wait, that's an important conversion factor. So if I have P in psia and V in ft^3, then P*V gives units of (psia*ft^3) which is 144 ft·lb_f per psia·ft³.

So, for the isothermal work, W = P1 V1 ln(V2/V1). Let's plug in the numbers:

P1 = 400 psia
V1 = 1.5 ft³
V2 = 4 ft³

So W = 400 * 1.5 * ln(4/1.5) 

Wait, 4/1.5 is 8/3, approximately 2.6667. The natural log of that is about ln(2.6667) ≈ 0.9808.

So 400 * 1.5 = 600. 600 * 0.9808 ≈ 588.5 psia·ft³.

But since each psia·ft³ is 144 ft·lb_f, then 588.5 * 144 = let me compute that.

Wait, 588.5 * 144: 500*144=72,000, 88.5*144 = let's see, 80*144=11,520, 8.5*144=1,224. So 11,520 + 1,224 = 12,744. So 72,000 + 12,744 = 84,744 ft·lb_f.

Now convert ft·lb_f to Btu: since 1 Btu = 778 ft·lb_f. So 84,744 / 778 ≈ let's compute that.

Compute 84,744 ÷ 778:

Well, 778 * 100 = 77,800. 84,744 - 77,800 = 6,944. 778 * 8 = 6,224. 6,944 -6,224=720. 778*0.927≈720. So approximately 108.9 Btu.

Wait, but I thought isothermal processes for ideal gases have Q = W, because ΔU is zero. So the heat transferred Q would be equal to the work done, but since the process is expansion, the system does work on the surroundings, so the work done by the system is positive, and heat is transferred into the system. So Q = +W.

Wait, but the question says what is the work and heat transferred. So both would be 108.92 Btu. Let me check the options. Option C is 108.92 Btu, so that's probably the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. Did I make any error in the unit conversions?

Let me recalculate:

P1 =400 psia, V1=1.5 ft³, V2=4 ft³.

W = P1 V1 ln(V2/V1) * (144 ft·lb_f per psia·ft³)

So 400 * 1.5 = 600 psia·ft³.

ln(4/1.5)=ln(8/3)=approx 0.9808.

So W=600 * 0.9808 = 588.48 psia·ft³.

Now, 588.48 * 144 ft·lb_f/psia·ft³ = ?

Let me compute 588 * 144:

500 *144=72,000.

88*144= let's see, 80*144=11,520, 8*144=1,152 → total 12,672.

So 72,000 +12,672 = 84,672. Then 0.48 *144=69.12 → 84,672+69.12=84,741.12 ft·lb_f.

Convert to Btu: 84,741.12 / 778 ≈ let me compute this.

778 * 100 =77,800 → 84,741.12-77,800=6,941.12.

Now, 778 *8=6,224 → 6,941.12-6,224=717.12.

717.12 /778≈ 0.9218.

So total is 100 +8 +0.9218≈108.9218 Btu.

So approximately 108.92 Btu, which matches option C.

So the answer should be C.

To solve the problem, we analyze the isothermal expansion of air in a piston-cylinder arrangement. The process is isothermal, meaning the temperature remains constant at 85°F. For an isothermal process involving an ideal gas, the work done is given by:

\[
W = P_1 V_1 \ln\left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right)
\]

where:
- \(P_1 = 400 \, \text{psia}\) (initial pressure),
- \(V_1 = 1.5 \, \text{ft}^3\) (initial volume),
- \(V_2 = 4 \, \text{ft}^3\) (final volume).

### Step 1: Calculate the work
Substituting the values:
\[
W = 400 \cdot 1.5 \cdot \ln\left(\frac{4}{1.5}\right)
\]

First, compute the ratio \(\frac{V_2}{V_1} = \frac{4}{1.5} \approx 2.6667\). The natural logarithm of this value is:
\[
\ln(2.6667) \approx 0.9808
\]

Now calculate the work:
\[
W = 400 \cdot 1.5 \cdot 0.9808 = 588.48 \, \text{psia} \cdot \text{ft}^3
\]

### Step 2: Convert units to Btu
Since \(1 \, \text{psia} \cdot \text{ft}^3 = 144 \, \text{ft} \cdot \text{lbf}\) and \(1 \, \text{Btu} = 778 \, \text{ft} \cdot \text{lbf}\), we convert:
\[
W = 588.48 \cdot 144 = 84,741.12 \, \text{ft} \cdot \text{lbf}
\]
\[
W = \frac{84,741.12}{778} \approx 108.92 \, \text{Btu}
\]

### Step 3: Heat transfer
For an isothermal process, the heat transferred (\(Q\)) is equal to the work done (\(W\)), as the internal energy change (\(\Delta U\)) is zero. Therefore:
\[
Q = W = 108.92 \, \text{Btu}
\]

### Final Answer
The work and heat transferred during the process are both approximately \(108.92 \, \text{Btu}\), which corresponds to option **C**.
