Question:

A 12-year-old boy decided to play a practical joke. Knowing that his parents were giving a dinner party that evening, the boy filled a bucket with ice-cold water and balanced it on the partially open door of the guest bedroom, thinking that his father would take the guests' coats there to put them on the bed. The boy then went off to play at a friend's house. The boy's father decided to keep all the guests' coats in the hall closet instead of putting them in the guest bedroom. Later that evening, one of the guests mistakenly wandered into the guest bedroom while searching for a bathroom. As the guest opened the door, the bucket fell and hit his head, causing a severe cut that required a dozen stitches. If the guest sues the boy for negligence, the most likely result is

Options:

A: the boy loses, because this "practical joke" posed a risk of severe harm and, therefore, the boy had a duty to exercise as much care as a reasonable adult.
B: the boy wins, because a child's conduct cannot be negligent.
C: the boy loses, because he did not act with the amount of care that one would expect from a 12-year-old child.
D: the boy wins, because he could not foresee that a guest would mistakenly enter the guest bedroom.
E: the boy wins, because he did not expect anyone to enter the guest bedroom.
F: the boy loses, as he left the house without removing the trap, knowing his parents were having guests over.
G: the boy wins, because the guest should have been more careful in an unfamiliar house.
H: the boy wins, because the guest unreasonably assumed the risk of entering an unfamiliar room rather than asking for directions to the bathroom.
I: the boy loses, because he intentionally set a trap that could potentially cause harm.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about negligence. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand it.

So, there's a 12-year-old boy who plays a practical joke. He fills a bucket with ice-cold water and balances it on a partially open guest bedroom door. His plan is that his father would take guests' coats into that room, so when the door is opened, the bucket would fall. But then his father decides to use the hall closet instead for the coats, so the boy's trap isn't triggered as intended. Later, a guest looking for the bathroom mistakenly goes into the guest bedroom, opens the door, and the bucket falls, causing a severe cut needing stitches.

Now, the guest is suing the boy for negligence. The question is about the likely outcome.

I remember that negligence involves four elements: duty, breach, causation, and damages. So I need to think about each of these.

First, duty. The boy is 12, so the standard is usually that of a reasonable child of the same age, experience, and intelligence. So the duty isn't as high as an adult's, but it's still there.

Next, breach. Did the boy's actions fall below the standard expected of a reasonable 12-year-old? Well, setting up a bucket of water as a prank seems like something a kid might do, but the question is whether a reasonable kid would foresee the risk of harm. If the boy knew or should have known that this could cause injury, then he breached the duty.

Causation. The guest's injury was a direct result of the boy's action. The bucket was set up by the boy, and when the guest opened the door, it fell. So causation seems clear.

Damages are obvious here since the guest needed stitches.

So the breach is the key issue. The options suggest different reasoning.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the boy loses because the joke posed a risk of severe harm, so he had to exercise adult care. But I think the standard for a child is that of a reasonable child, not an adult. So A might not be correct.

Option B says the boy wins because a child can't be negligent. That's not right; children can be held to the standard of their peers, so B is wrong.

Option C claims the boy loses because he didn't act with the care expected of a 12-year-old. If a reasonable 12-year-old would have known the prank was dangerous, then C could be correct. But does a typical 12-year-old understand that such a prank could cause severe harm? Maybe, maybe not. Some might think it's just a harmless prank, but others might realize it could hurt someone.

Option D says the boy wins because he couldn't foresee a guest entering. But the thing is, the boy set it up expecting his father to take coats there, so he must have foreseen that someone would open the door. The fact that it was a different person (a guest instead of his father) might not matter because the risk is still there. So D might not be a good defense.

Option E says the boy wins because he didn't expect anyone to enter. But he did expect someone (his father) to enter, so E isn't correct.

Option F says the boy loses because he left without removing the trap, knowing his parents were having guests. That seems relevant. A reasonable child might be expected to realize that leaving a trap could be dangerous, especially with guests around. So F could be a possible answer.

Option G says the guest should have been more careful. But in negligence, the plaintiff's contributory negligence isn't a complete defense unless it's the main cause. So G might not win.

Option H says the guest assumed the risk. But the guest didn't know about the trap, so they can't assume the risk. So H is incorrect.

Option I says the boy loses because he intentionally set a trap that could cause harm. This is interesting because if the boy intended to create the risk, it might be intentional tort, not negligence. But the question is about negligence. However, sometimes intentional acts can also involve negligence. But I'm not sure if I is the best answer.

Wait, the boy's action was intentional—he set up the prank. But the harm was a result of that intentional act, even if he didn't intend for the specific person to be hurt. So maybe this is more about intentional tort, but the question is framed as negligence. So maybe I isn't the right approach.

So back to the options. The key is whether the boy breached the duty of care expected of a 12-year-old. If a reasonable 12-year-old would not have set up such a trap knowing it could cause harm, then the boy breached that duty.

Alternatively, if the boy didn't realize the risk, but a reasonable child would have, then he's liable.

So looking at the options again, option C says he loses because he didn't act with the care expected of a 12-year-old. If the standard is that of a 12-year-old, and the boy didn't meet that, then C is correct.

Wait, but another angle: when the boy set the trap, he might have thought it was harmless, but a reasonable child would know that a heavy bucket could cause injury. So yes, the boy breached the duty.

Option F talks about leaving without removing the trap, knowing about the guests. That's another angle—his failure to remove the trap could be a breach. So F could also be correct.

But which option is better? The question is about the most likely result.

In tort law, a child's standard is their own age's reasonableness. So if the boy didn't act as a reasonable 12-year-old would, he's negligent.

So option C says he loses because he didn't meet the 12-year-old standard. So that's a possible answer.

Alternatively, option I says he loses because he intentionally set a trap that could cause harm. But that's more about intent, which might not apply here because the claim is negligence, not intentional tort.

Wait, but even if the act was intentional, the boy could still be negligent. But the question is about negligence, so the focus is on whether he met the standard of care.

So between options C and F. Option C is about the standard of care for a child, while F is about leaving the trap.

I think the main issue is whether the boy's action was negligent. So option C is more directly about the breach of duty.

Wait, but another thought: in some jurisdictions, when a minor engages in an activity that's inherently dangerous, they might be held to an adult standard. But I'm not sure if that's the case here. But the standard is generally that of a reasonable child unless the activity is adult in nature.

So, the boy's action—setting a prank—might be something a child does, so the standard remains that of a child.

So, the boy would be judged against what a reasonable 12-year-old would do. If a reasonable 12-year-old would have known that placing a heavy bucket of water on a door could cause injury, then the boy breached that duty.

Therefore, option C would apply, and the boy loses.

Alternatively, if the court decides that the boy's actions were inherently dangerous, then he might be held to a higher standard, as in option A. But I think that's less likely because the standard for children is typically their own age group.

So I'm leaning towards option C as the correct answer.

The question revolves around whether a 12-year-old boy can be held negligent for setting up a prank that resulted in harm to a guest. Negligence requires proving duty, breach, causation, and damages. The key issue is whether the boy breached the standard of care expected of a reasonable 12-year-old.

- **Option A** suggests the boy loses because the prank posed a risk of severe harm, requiring adult-level care. However, the standard for children is typically that of a reasonable child of the same age, not an adult. Thus, this option is unlikely to be correct.

- **Option B** claims the boy wins because a child's conduct cannot be negligent. This is incorrect, as children can be held to the standard of their peers.

- **Option C** states the boy loses because he did not act with the care expected of a 12-year-old. This is plausible because a reasonable 12-year-old might foresee the risk of harm from a heavy bucket falling, and the boy's actions fell below this standard.

- **Option D** argues the boy wins because he could not foresee a guest entering the room. However, the boy set the trap expecting someone (his father) to enter, so the risk was foreseeable. This makes D less likely.

- **Option E** claims the boy wins because he did not expect anyone to enter. This is incorrect because the boy did expect someone to enter, as he set the trap for his father.

- **Option F** suggests the boy loses because he left the trap without removing it, knowing guests were present. This is relevant, as a reasonable child might be expected to remove the trap to avoid harm. However, the primary focus is on whether the boy's initial actions breached the standard of care.

- **Option G** argues the guest should have been more careful. This is not a complete defense in negligence, as contributory negligence does not fully absolve liability.

- **Option H** claims the guest assumed the risk by entering an unfamiliar room. This is incorrect because the guest could not have known about the trap.

- **Option I** states the boy loses because he intentionally set a trap that could cause harm. While the boy's act was intentional, the question focuses on negligence. The breach of duty is better analyzed under the standard of care for a 12-year-old.

The most likely result is that the boy loses because his actions did not meet the standard of care expected of a reasonable 12-year-old, making **Option C** the best answer.
