Question:

A 32-year-old man and his 29-year-old wife come to the office for evaluation for infertility. The wife's gynecologist has reported that her anatomic and physiologic evaluation disclosed no abnormalities and that assessment of potential male factors is needed. The husband is 188 cm (6 ft 3 in) tall with fair skin and little facial hair. He has mild gynecomastia and small, firm testicles. No sperm are seen on semen analysis. Which of the following tests is most likely to establish the underlying cause of this couple's infertility?

Options:

A: Serum cortisol concentration
B: Serum parathyroid hormone concentration
C: Prostate-specific antigen test
D: Semen fructose concentration
E: Thyroid function test
F: Serum prolactin concentration
G: Serum follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone concentrations
H: Serum estrogen and testosterone concentrations
I: Adrenal function test
J: Karyotype from peripheral leukocytes

Okay, so I've got this question about a couple's infertility, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see. The wife is 29 and the husband is 32. The wife's gynecologist didn't find any issues, so now they're looking into the male factors.

The husband is 6'3" with fair skin and little facial hair. Hmm, tall and fair isn't necessarily a red flag, but the lack of facial hair might indicate something hormonal. He has mild gynecomastia—so some breast tissue growth—and small, firm testicles. Oh, and the semen analysis shows no sperm. So that's azoospermia.

Wait, azoospermia can be due to various issues. Let me think. Common causes could be blockages like vasectomy or congenital absence of the vas deferens, but here the testicles are small, which might point more towards a problem with sperm production rather than obstruction.

His features—gynecomastia, lack of facial hair, tall stature—are making me think about Klinefelter syndrome. Klinefelter is a chromosomal abnormality, typically 47,XXY. Males with this usually have infertility, small testes, low testosterone, and sometimes gynecomastia. They might have reduced facial hair because of low androgens.

So if it's Klinefelter, the diagnosis would be confirmed with a karyotype showing the extra X chromosome. The other option I'm considering is maybe something like Y chromosome microdeletions, but those are usually associated with specific issues like oligospermia rather than azoospermia.

Looking at the options, the one that would detect a chromosomal issue like Klinefelter is the karyotype test. So option J is the karyotype from peripheral leukocytes.

Wait, other tests: FSH and LH levels could indicate primary vs secondary hypogonadism. In Klinefelter, FSH and LH are usually elevated because the testes aren't producing enough testosterone, so the pituitary gland compensates by releasing more hormones.

But the question is about establishing the underlying cause. If the FSH is high, it suggests primary testicular failure. But that doesn't tell us why. The karyotype would tell us it's due to a chromosomal abnormality.

So the most definitive test here is the karyotype. So the correct answer should be J.

The couple in question is evaluating infertility, with the wife's evaluation showing no abnormalities and the focus now on the husband. The husband presents with azoospermia (no sperm in semen), mild gynecomastia, small firm testicles, little facial hair, and tall stature. These features suggest a potential chromosomal abnormality such as Klinefelter syndrome, which is commonly characterized by 47,XXY and associated with infertility, small testes, gynecomastia, and low testosterone levels.

While tests like serum FSH and LH (option G) could indicate primary hypogonadism, they would not identify the underlying cause. The definitive test to diagnose a chromosomal abnormality like Klinefelter syndrome is a karyotype analysis, which would reveal the presence of an extra X chromosome. Therefore, the most appropriate test to establish the underlying cause of infertility in this case is a karyotype from peripheral leukocytes.

Answer: J
