Question:

A homeowner entered into a written contract with a house painter to have his house painted for $10,000. The contract stated in part: "It is agreed that the house painter will paint the house using off-white latex paint, and will finish the job within 30 days from the execution of this agreement. If the homeowner finds the completed job to be satisfactory, he will pay the house painter $10,000 within one week after the job is completed. "Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the homeowner's contractual obligation to pay the house painter $10,000?

Options:

A: The house painter's performance under the contract would be an express condition subsequent to the homeowner's duty of payment of the $10,000.
B: The performances of the homeowner and the house painter were, in essence, concurrent conditions.
C: The performances of the homeowner and the house painter were, in essence, independent conditions.
D: Payment of the $10,000 by the homeowner would be a concurrent condition to the house painter's duty of performance.
E: The house painter's performance under the contract would be an express condition precedent to the homeowner's duty of payment of the $10,000.
F: Payment of the $10,000 by the homeowner would be an express condition subsequent to the house painter's duty of performance.
G: Payment of the $10,000 by the homeowner would be an express condition precedent to the house painter's duty of performance.
H: The homeowner's satisfaction with the job is an implied condition precedent to the house painter's duty of performance.
I: The homeowner's satisfaction with the job would be an express condition precedent to the house painter's duty of performance.
J: The homeowner's satisfaction with the job is an implied condition subsequent to the house painter's duty of performance.

Okay, so I've got this contract law question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand.

The scenario is a homeowner who hires a house painter for $10,000. The contract says the painter must use off-white latex paint and finish within 30 days. Once the homeowner finds the job satisfactory, they'll pay the $10,000 within a week after completion.

The question is about the homeowner's obligation to pay. The options are about whether certain conditions are express or implied, and whether they're precedent or subsequent. I remember that in contract law, conditions can be conditions precedent, which must be fulfilled before an obligation arises, or conditions subsequent, which, if breached, allow the other party to end the contract.

So, looking at the contract, the painter has duties: use specific paint and finish on time. The homeowner's duty is to pay $10k, but only if satisfied with the job. So the payment is conditional on the job being satisfactory.

Wait, but in the contract, it's written that after the job is done and the homeowner is satisfied, then they'll pay. So the payment is after the painter's performance. So, the painter must perform first, and then the homeowner pays if satisfied.

In contract terms, the painter's performance is a condition precedent to the homeowner's duty to pay. Because the homeowner doesn't have to pay unless the painter completes the job satisfactorily.

So which options relate to that? Let's look at the choices.

Option E says the painter's performance is an express condition precedent to the homeowner's payment. That sounds exactly like what I was thinking. Because it's explicitly stated in the contract that payment is after satisfactory completion, the painter's act is a condition that must be met before the homeowner has to pay.

Option A says the painter's performance is a condition subsequent. No, because a condition subsequent would mean that the homeowner's duty arises, and if the painter doesn't perform, the homeowner can end the contract. But here, the payment is dependent on the performance, so it's a condition precedent.

Option E is looking good. Let me check others to be sure.

Option I says the homeowner's satisfaction is an express condition precedent to the painter's duty. Wait, that can't be right. The painter's duty is to perform; the homeowner's satisfaction affects payment, not the painter's duty to perform. The painter must perform regardless, and then the homeowner decides whether to pay based on satisfaction.

Option C talks about independent conditions. Independent conditions are where each party's obligation is independent of the other. Like, if I promise to pay as long as I'm satisfied, and the other party has to perform regardless. But in this case, the payment is directly tied to the painter's satisfactory performance. So maybe they are independent? Wait, no, because the homeowner's payment is conditioned on the painter's performance, making the painter's performance a condition for payment.

Wait, the contract says if the homeowner finds the job satisfactory, they'll pay. So the payment is conditioned on the painter doing a satisfactory job. So the painter's performance is a condition precedent to payment.

So looking again, the correct option would be E: The house painter's performance under the contract would be an express condition precedent to the homeowner's duty of payment of the $10,000.

Wait, but let me think about the other options. Option I says the homeowner's satisfaction is express condition precedent to the painter's duty. That doesn't make sense because the painter's duty is to perform, and the satisfaction affects payment, not the duty to perform.

Option H says satisfaction is an implied condition precedent. But in the contract, it's explicitly stated, so it's express, not implied.

Option E seems correct because the painter must perform (satisfactorily) before the homeowner's payment is due. That makes it a condition precedent.

The contract between the homeowner and the house painter specifies that the homeowner will pay $10,000 within one week after the job is completed, provided the job is satisfactory. This indicates that the house painter's performance—specifically, completing the job satisfactorily—is a prerequisite for the homeowner's obligation to pay. In contract law, this is known as a condition precedent. Since the contract explicitly states this condition, it is an express condition precedent.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The painter's performance is not a condition subsequent; it is a condition precedent because the homeowner's duty to pay arises only after satisfactory performance.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The performances are not concurrent conditions; the homeowner's payment is dependent on the painter's prior satisfactory performance.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The conditions are not independent; the homeowner's payment is directly tied to the painter's performance.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Payment is not a concurrent condition to the painter's duty; it is a condition precedent.
- **Option E**: Correct. The painter's performance is explicitly stated as a condition that must be fulfilled before the homeowner's duty to pay arises, making it an express condition precedent.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Payment is not a condition subsequent; it is a condition precedent.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Payment is not a condition precedent to the painter's duty; it is a condition precedent to the homeowner's duty.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The homeowner's satisfaction is explicitly stated in the contract, so it is not an implied condition.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The homeowner's satisfaction affects payment, not the painter's duty to perform, and it is explicitly stated in the contract.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The homeowner's satisfaction is not a condition subsequent; it is a condition precedent to payment.

The most accurate statement is **Option E**: The house painter's performance under the contract would be an express condition precedent to the homeowner's duty of payment of the $10,000.
