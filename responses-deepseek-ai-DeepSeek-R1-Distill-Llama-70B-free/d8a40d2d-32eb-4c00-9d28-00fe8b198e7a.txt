The hunter turned, causing the rifle to be pointed at the hiker. The hiker felt sure that he was going to get shot, but the gun did not go off. The hiker asserts a claim for assault against the hunter. In his action, the most likely result is that the hiker will

A: recover, if the hiker can prove negligence on the hunter's part.
B: recover, if the hunter knew the hiker was there when he turned.
C: recover, because the hunter's rifle was pointed directly at him.
D: recover, if the hiker feared for his life.
E: not recover, if the hunter did not intend to shoot the hiker.
F: not recover, unless the hiker can prove the hunter saw him.
G: not recover, if the hiker failed to make his presence known to the hunter.
H: recover, because the hunter's decision to carry the gun was voluntary.
I: not recover, unless the hunter intended to scare the hiker.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this tort law question about assault. Let me go through it step by step. 

The scenario is a hiker who comes around a bend and sees a hunter with a rifle. The hunter turns, and the rifle points at the hiker. The hiker felt like he was going to be shot, but the gun didn't go off. Now, the hiker is suing for assault. The question is, what's the outcome? The options are from A to I.

First, I remember that assault is an intentional tort. The elements are that the defendant acted in a way that caused a reasonable apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact. So the key here is intent and whether the plaintiff actually feared imminent harm.

So looking at the facts: the hunter turned, causing the rifle to point at the hiker. The hiker felt sure he'd be shot. But the gun didn't fire. So, is there an assault?

I think the main issue is whether the hunter intended to point the gun or if it was an accident. Because for assault, the defendant must have intended to cause that apprehension. If the hunter didn't realize the hiker was there and turned accidentally, maybe there's no intent. But if he knew the hiker was there and turned, pointing the gun, that could be intentional.

Looking at the options:

Option B says the hiker will recover if the hunter knew he was there when he turned. That makes sense because if the hunter was aware, the act of turning and pointing the gun would be intentional, creating apprehension.

Option E says the hiker won't recover if the hunter didn't intend to shoot. But wait, assault doesn't require intent to shoot; it's about intent to cause apprehension. So even if the hunter didn't plan to pull the trigger, pointing the gun at someone could be enough if he intended to do that action.

Option I says the hiker can't recover unless the hunter intended to scare him. Hmm, intent to scare might be relevant, but I think the key is whether the action would cause a reasonable person to fear imminent harm. If the hunter didn't intend any harmful action, maybe not. But if he pointed the gun on purpose, knowing someone was there, that would count.

Option B seems to hinge on the hunter's knowledge of the hiker's presence. So if the hunter knew the hiker was there, turning and pointing the rifle would likely satisfy the intent element for assault.

Option A is about negligence. But assault is intentional, not negligent. So even if the hunter was negligent, that wouldn't support an assault claim. It might be a negligence claim, but the question is about assault.

Option C says because the rifle was pointed directly. But pointing alone might not be enough without the intent. Like, if the hunter didn't know the hiker was there, it might not be assault.

Option D is about the hiker's fear. Well, the hiker did fear, but the standard is whether a reasonable person would fear imminent harm. So if the hiker's fear was reasonable, that's part of it, but the main issue is the hunter's intent.

Option F says the hiker must prove the hunter saw him. That's similar to option B. If the hunter saw him, then he knew, so that would support the intent.

Option G says the hiker didn't make his presence known. I don't think that's a defense. The hiker has the right to be there; it's the hunter's responsibility not to point a gun at someone without reason.

Option H is about carrying the gun voluntarily. I don't think that's directly relevant. Carrying a gun isn't the issue; it's how it's used.

So putting it all together, the hiker's case for assault depends on whether the hunter intended to point the gun at him, knowing he was there. So the correct answer would be B, because if the hunter knew the hiker was there when he turned, that shows the intentional act causing apprehension.

The question revolves around whether the hiker can successfully claim assault against the hunter. Assault, as an intentional tort, requires that the defendant acted in a way that caused a reasonable apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact. The key elements are intent and whether the plaintiff reasonably feared imminent harm.

In this scenario, the hunter turned, causing the rifle to point at the hiker, who then feared being shot. The critical issue is whether the hunter intended to point the gun at the hiker, knowing he was there. If the hunter was aware of the hiker's presence and intentionally pointed the rifle, this would satisfy the intent requirement for assault. However, if the hunter did not know the hiker was there, the act may not meet the intent standard for assault.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Assault is an intentional tort, not based on negligence.
- **Option B**: Correct. If the hunter knew the hiker was there when he turned, this demonstrates intent, satisfying the elements of assault.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Pointing the rifle alone is insufficient without intent.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. While the hiker's fear is relevant, the focus is on the hunter's intent.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. Assault does not require intent to shoot, only intent to cause apprehension.
- **Option F**: Similar to B, but B is more precise regarding the hunter's knowledge.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The hiker's failure to announce himself is not a defense.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. Carrying the gun voluntarily is irrelevant to the intent required for assault.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. Intent to scare is not the sole criterion; intent to cause apprehension suffices.

The most accurate answer is **Option B**, as it directly addresses the intent element by focusing on whether the hunter knew the hiker was there when he turned and pointed the rifle.
