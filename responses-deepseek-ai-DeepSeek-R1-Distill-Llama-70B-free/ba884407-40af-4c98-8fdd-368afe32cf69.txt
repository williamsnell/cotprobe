Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the volume of a rectangular tank, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with unit conversions, but I'll give it a try. Let's see what the question says.

The tank measures 2.0 meters by 50 centimeters by 200 millimeters. Hmm, I remember that volume is calculated by multiplying length, width, and height. But wait, all the units have to be the same before I can multiply them. Right, so I need to convert all of these measurements into the same unit.

Let me think about the units. I've got meters, centimeters, and millimeters. I think the easiest way is to convert everything into meters because the first measurement is already in meters. Or wait, maybe centimeters would be easier since 50 cm is a smaller number. Alternatively, converting everything to millimeters might also work, but that could get a bit messy with bigger numbers. Hmm, maybe centimeters is the way to go.

Wait, no, let's think in terms of liters. Oh right, 1 liter is equal to 1 cubic decimeter, and 1 cubic meter is 1000 liters. So maybe converting all measurements to decimeters would be best because each decimeter cubed is a liter. Let me make sure: 1 m = 10 decimeters, 1 dm = 0.1 m. So 1 cubic meter is (10 dm)^3 = 1000 dm³, which is 1000 liters.

So I need to convert each measurement into decimeters.

The first measurement is 2.0 meters. Since 1 meter is 10 decimeters, 2.0 meters would be 2.0 * 10 = 20 decimeters.

The second measurement is 50 centimeters. I know that 1 decimeter is 10 centimeters, so 50 cm divided by 10 is 5 decimeters. So that's 5 dm.

The third measurement is 200 millimeters. Oh, wait, 1 decimeter is 100 millimeters, so 200 mm is 2 decimeters. Because 200 divided by 100 is 2. So that's 2 dm.

Now, I can calculate the volume in cubic decimeters (dm³), which is the same as liters. So the volume is length × width × height: 20 dm × 5 dm × 2 dm.

Let me compute that: 20 * 5 is 100, and 100 * 2 is 200. So the volume is 200 dm³, which is 200 liters.

Wait, let me double-check the conversions to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 2 meters is 20 dm, yes. 50 cm is 5 dm, correct. 200 mm is 2 dm, right. So 20 * 5 is 100, times 2 is 200. That makes sense.

Looking at the answer options, option G is 200 liters. So that's the correct answer.

The volume of a rectangular tank is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and height. To ensure consistency, all measurements must be in the same unit. Converting the given dimensions to decimeters (dm) is ideal because 1 cubic decimeter (dm³) equals 1 liter.

1. **Convert 2.0 meters to decimeters**:  
   \( 2.0 \, \text{m} = 2.0 \times 10 = 20 \, \text{dm} \).

2. **Convert 50 centimeters to decimeters**:  
   \( 50 \, \text{cm} = \frac{50}{10} = 5 \, \text{dm} \).

3. **Convert 200 millimeters to decimeters**:  
   \( 200 \, \text{mm} = \frac{200}{100} = 2 \, \text{dm} \).

Now, calculate the volume:  
\[
\text{Volume} = 20 \, \text{dm} \times 5 \, \text{dm} \times 2 \, \text{dm} = 200 \, \text{dm}^3 = 200 \, \text{liters}.
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is **G: 200 liters**.
