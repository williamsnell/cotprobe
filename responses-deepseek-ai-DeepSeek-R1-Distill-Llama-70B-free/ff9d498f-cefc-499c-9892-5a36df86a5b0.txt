Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to calculate the universal gravitational constant G. Hmm, let me think about what I know. I remember from physics that G is related to the gravitational force between two masses, but in this case, I think it's given in terms of Earth's properties.

The problem gives me the Earth's radius as 6.4 × 10^6 meters and the average density as 5.5 × 10^3 kg/m³. Oh right, and the volume of a sphere is V = (4/3)πr³. So I guess I'll have to use these to find the Earth's mass first.

Wait, the formula for density is density = mass/volume, so mass = density × volume. That makes sense. So I can calculate the Earth's mass using its density and volume.

Let me write that down step by step. First, the volume of the Earth is (4/3)πr³. Plugging in the radius: r = 6.4e6 meters. Calculating that would give me the volume in cubic meters. Then multiply by the density (5.5e3 kg/m³) to get the mass in kilograms.

Once I have the mass of the Earth, I can use the formula for gravitational acceleration at the Earth's surface. I remember that the acceleration due to gravity g is related to G, M (Earth's mass), and r (radius) by the equation g = G*M/r². So rearranging for G gives G = g*r² / M.

Wait, but what's the value of g here? I think on Earth's surface, g is approximately 9.8 m/s². So I'll use that value.

So putting it all together:

1. Calculate Earth's volume: V = (4/3)π*(6.4e6)^3.
2. Multiply by density to get mass M = density * V.
3. Use G = (g * r²) / M.

Let me start crunching the numbers. But wait, maybe I should compute each step carefully to avoid mistakes.

First, compute the radius cubed. 6.4e6^3 is (6.4)^3 times 1e18. Let's calculate 6.4^3: 6.4 * 6.4 is 40.96, times 6.4 is 262.144. So 262.144e18 m³. But wait, 6.4e6 is 6,400,000 meters. So cubing that gives (6.4)^3 * (1e6)^3 = 262.144 * 1e18 = 2.62144e20 m³? Wait wait, wait. Let me re-calculate that. Wait, 6.4e6 is 6.4 million meters. So when you cube it, (6.4e6)^3 = (6.4)^3 * (1e6)^3. (1e6)^3 is 1e18. 6.4^3 is 6.4 *6.4=40.96, 40.96 *6.4=262.144. So yes, 262.144e18 m³, which is 2.62144e20 m³.

Now the volume V is (4/3)π*(6.4e6)^3. So (4/3) * π * 2.62144e20. Let's compute that. (4/3) is approximately 1.3333. 1.3333 * 3.1416 (approx π) = about 4.1888. So 4.1888 multiplied by 2.62144e20 gives... let's see, 4 * 2.6e20 is 1.04e21, and 0.1888*2.6e20 is about 0.491e20, so total around 1.531e21 m³. Wait, but let me calculate it more accurately.

Wait, 4/3 π is approximately 4.18879. So 4.18879 * 2.62144e20 = let's compute 4 * 2.62144e20 = 1.048576e21, 0.18879 * 2.62144e20. 0.1 * 2.62144e20 is 2.62144e19, 0.08 * 2.62144e20 is 0.209715e20, wait, no, wait 0.08 * 2.62144e20 is 2.097152e19. And 0.00879 * 2.62144e20 is approximately 2.3e18. So adding those: 2.62144e19 + 2.09715e19 = 4.71859e19, plus 2.3e18 is about 4.71859e19 + 0.23e19 = 4.94859e19. Wait, but that seems off. Hmm, maybe I should just multiply 4.18879 * 2.62144e20.

Wait, 4.18879 * 2.62144e20 = let's compute 4 *2.62144e20 = 1.048576e21, 0.18879 * 2.62144e20 = 0.18879 *2.62144 = approx 0.4944, so 0.4944e20. So total volume V is 1.048576e21 + 0.4944e20 = 1.097976e21 m³. Approximately 1.098e21 m³.

Wait, wait, wait, maybe I should use exact calculations. Let me try again.

6.4e6^3 = (6.4)^3 * 1e18 = 262.144 * 1e18 = 2.62144e20 m³.

Then V = (4/3)π * 2.62144e20 = (4 * 3.1415926536 / 3) * 2.62144e20.

4/3 is about 1.3333333. 1.3333333 * π ≈ 4.18879.

So 4.18879 * 2.62144e20 = let's compute 4 *2.62144e20 =1.048576e21, 0.18879 * 2.62144e20.

0.18879 * 2.62144e20 = 0.18879 *2.62144 = let me compute that:

2.62144 * 0.1 = 0.262144
2.62144 * 0.08 = 0.2097152
2.62144 *0.00879 ≈ let's compute 2.62144 *0.008 = 0.02097152, and 2.62144 *0.00079= approx 0.002073. So total is approximately 0.02097152 + 0.002073 ≈ 0.0230445.

Adding the three parts: 0.262144 + 0.2097152 = 0.4718592 + 0.0230445 ≈0.4949037. So the 0.18879 * 2.62144e20 is approximately 0.4949037e20, which is 4.949037e19 m³.

So total V is 1.048576e21 + 4.949037e19 = 1.048576e21 + 0.04949037e21 = 1.098066e21 m³. So approximately 1.098e21 m³.

Now, mass M = density * volume. Density is 5.5e3 kg/m³. So M = 5.5e3 kg/m³ * 1.098e21 m³.

Calculating that: 5.5e3 * 1.098e21 = 5.5 *1.098 = let's compute 5 *1.098=5.49, 0.5 *1.098=0.549, so total 5.49+0.549=6.039. So 6.039e24 kg? Wait, because 1e3 *1e21 is 1e24, so 5.5e3 * 1.098e21 = 5.5 *1.098e24? Wait, no, 5.5e3 *1.098e21 = (5.5 *1.098) * (1e3 * 1e21) )= 6.039 * 1e24 = 6.039e24 kg.

Wait, but wait a second. 5.5e3 is 5,500. 1.098e21 is 1.098e21. So 5,500 * 1.098e21 = 5.5e3 * 1.098e21.

Multiply 5.5 *1.098 = 6.039. Then the exponents: 1e3 * 1e21 = 1e24. So M = 6.039e24 kg.

Now, using the formula G = (g * r²) / M.

g is 9.8 m/s², r is 6.4e6 m.

So r squared is (6.4e6)^2 = 40.96e12 m². Because (6.4)^2 is 40.96, and (1e6)^2 is 1e12. So 40.96e12 m².

So numerator is 9.8 * 40.96e12. Let's compute that.

9.8 *40.96 = let's compute 40 *9.8=392, 0.96 *9.8=9.408. So total 392 +9.408=401.408. So 401.408e12 m²·m/s²? Wait, the units would be m³/s², but let's just focus on the numbers for now.

So numerator is 401.408e12.

Denominator is M =6.039e24 kg.

So G = (401.408e12) / (6.039e24) = (401.408 / 6.039) * 1e-12.

Compute 401.408 /6.039. Let's approximate. 6.039 * 66 = 6.039 *60=362.34, 6.039 *6=36.234, so 362.34 +36.234=398.574. So 6.039 *66 ≈398.574. Our numerator is 401.408, which is about 2.834 higher. So 66 + (2.834/6.039) ≈66 + 0.469 ≈66.469.

So 401.408 /6.039 ≈66.469.

So G ≈66.469e-12 Nm²/kg².

Wait, because 401.408e12 /6.039e24 = (401.408/6.039) * (1e12 / 1e24) ) = 66.469 * 1e-12 = 6.6469e-11 Nm²/kg².

Wait, because 1e12 /1e24 is 1e-12. So 66.469e-12 is 6.6469e-11.

So G is approximately 6.65e-11 Nm²/kg².

Now, looking at the options:

A:4.2e-11

B:8e-10

C:6.7e-10

D:6.7e-11

E:5.3e-11

F:7.0e-11

G:9.8e-11

H:3.3e-11

I:1.0e-10

J:7.5e-11

Hmm. My calculation gave me about 6.65e-11. Looking at the options, the closest one would be D:6.7e-11 or F:7.0e-11, but wait, D is 6.7e-11, which is very close. Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation error somewhere. Let me check my steps again.

Wait, let me go back to the mass calculation. I had V=1.098e21 m³. Multiply by density 5.5e3 kg/m³: M=5.5e3 *1.098e21 =5.5 *1.098 =6.039 →6.039e24 kg. That seems right.

Then, numerator is g*r²=9.8*(6.4e6)^2.

Wait, let me recompute that.

(6.4e6)^2 = (6.4)^2 * (1e6)^2 =40.96 *1e12 =4.096e13? Wait, wait. 1e6 squared is 1e12, correct. 6.4 squared is 40.96, so 40.96e12 m².

So 9.8 *40.96e12 = 9.8 *40.96 =401.408, so 401.408e12 =4.01408e14 (wait, no, 401.408e12 is 4.01408e14? No, wait, 401.408e12 is 4.01408e+02 *1e12 =4.01408e14? Wait, no. 401.408e12 is 401.408 *1e12 =4.01408e+02 *1e12=4.01408e14? Wait, 401.408e12 is 4.01408e+14? No, wait 401.408e12 is 4.01408e+02 *e12 = 4.01408e14? Hmm, I'm getting confused. Wait, 401.408e12 is 4.01408e14. Because 401.408 =4.01408 × 100 =4.01408e2. So 4.01408e2 *1e12 =4.01408e14.

So numerator is 4.01408e14.

Denominator is M=6.039e24 kg.

So G =4.01408e14 /6.039e24 = (4.01408 /6.039) ) *1e-10.

Compute 4.01408 /6.039. Let me do that division. 6.039 goes into 4.014 about 0.664 times. Because 6.039 *0.664 = approx 6 *0.664=3.984, 0.039 *0.664≈0.0259, so total ≈4.0099. So approximately 0.664.

So 0.664 *1e-10 =6.64e-11 Nm²/kg².

So G≈6.64e-11, which is 6.6e-11.

Looking back at the options, option D is 6.7e-11, which is very close. But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the volume. Let me recalculate the volume again.

Volume V = (4/3)πr³.

r=6.4e6 m. So r³ is (6.4e6)^3 =6.4^3=262.144, so 262.144e18 m³. Then, (4/3) * π * 262.144e18.

(4/3) * π = about 4.18879. So 4.18879 *262.144e18 = let's compute 4.18879 *262.144.

Wait, 4 *262.144 =1048.576. 0.18879 *262.144 ≈ let's compute 0.1 *262.144=26.2144, 0.08*262.144=20.97152, 0.00879*262.144≈2.305. So sum: 26.2144 +20.97152=47.18592 +2.305=49.49092. So total V ≈ (1048.576 +49.49092)e18 =1098.06692e18 m³ =1.098e21 m³. Which matches earlier calculation.

Mass M=5.5e3 kg/m³ *1.098e21 m³ =5.5e3 *1.098e21=5.5*1.098=6.039, so 6.039e24 kg.

Now, G= (g r²)/M = (9.8 * (6.4e6)^2 )/(6.039e24).

Compute numerator: 9.8*(6.4e6)^2 =9.8*(40.96e12) )=9.8*40.96e12 =401.408e12 =4.01408e14.

So 4.01408e14 /6.039e24 = (4.01408 /6.039) )e-10.

4.01408 /6.039 ≈ 0.6646, so G≈0.6646e-10 =6.646e-11 N·m²/kg².

That's approximately 6.65e-11. But the options are D:6.7e-11, which is very close. So the correct answer should be D.

Wait, but let me check once again. Another way to calculate G is using the formula:

G = (4π³ r³ g)/(3 M).

Wait, no, perhaps I should think about another approach. Alternatively, using the relation between g and G.

Wait, g = G M / r² → G = g r² / M.

Yes, that's the same as I used earlier.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the volume calculation. Let me confirm:

r =6.4e6 m.

Volume V = (4/3)πr³ = (4/3)π*(6.4e6)^3.

(6.4e6)^3 =262.144e18 m³.

Multiply by (4/3)π: 4/3 is 1.3333333, π is ~3.14159265. So 1.3333333 *3.14159265 ≈4.18879.

4.18879 *262.144e18 = (4.18879 *262.144) e18.

4.18879 *262.144 = let me compute more accurately.

Compute 4 *262.144 =1048.576.

0.18879 *262.144:

Break down 0.18879 into 0.1 + 0
