Question:

In 1996, a developer purchased a 100-acre tract located in a northern county in a state. Shortly thereafter, the developer prepared a subdivision plan that created 100 one-acre residential building lots on this tract. In 1997, the subdivision plan was recorded with the county recorder's office. During the next few years, the developer sold 60 residential lots to individual purchasers. Each deed specified that every lot designated on the subdivision plan was to be recorded in the county recorder's office. Each deed also provided the following:"No house trailer or mobile home shall be built or maintained on any lot within the subdivision. "In 2003, the developer conveyed the remaining 40 lots to a builder by deed that included language identical to that contained in the first 60 deeds. This deed from the developer to the builder was recorded. By 2008, the builder had sold all of the 40 lots. Each of these deeds identified each lot as being a part of the subdivision, but did not include the clause relating to mobile homes. On January 30, 2009, a buyer, who had purchased one of the residential lots from the builder, placed a mobile home on his property. Which of the following statements is LEAST accurate with respect to the buyer's deed?

Options:

A: The buyer has no obligation to remove the mobile home.
B: All subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of contract.
C: The deed from the builder to the buyer did not include the covenant prohibiting mobile homes.
D: The covenant prohibiting mobile homes ran with the land as far as the builder, but not as far as the buyer.
E: All subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of estate.
F: The buyer should have had constructive notice of the restriction against mobile homes.
G: The buyer should have had actual notice of the restriction against mobile homes.
H: The covenant prohibiting mobile homes could be enforced by any subdivision lot owner.
I: The covenant prohibiting mobile homes was not recorded with the county recorder's office.
J: The covenant prohibiting mobile homes could only be enforced by the original developer.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this real property law question. Let me read through it carefully and break it down step by step.

So, the scenario is about a developer who bought a 100-acre tract in 1996. He created a subdivision plan with 100 one-acre lots, which was recorded in 1997. Then, from 1997 onwards, he sold 60 lots, and each deed had a clause prohibiting mobile homes. In 2003, he sold the remaining 40 lots to a builder with the same clause. The builder then sold all 40 lots, but his deeds didn't include that mobile home clause. Now, in 2009, a buyer who bought from the builder put a mobile home on their lot. The question is about the buyer's deed and which statement is least accurate.

Hmm. So, the options are A to J, and I need to find the least accurate statement regarding the buyer's deed.

First, I think I need to understand what's going on with the covenants here. The developer included a restrictive covenant in the initial 60 deeds, which prohibits mobile homes. Then, when he sold to the builder in 2003, the deed had the same clause. But when the builder sold the lots, the deeds didn't include that clause. So, the buyer's deed doesn't have the covenant.

Wait, but real covenants can run with the land. For a covenant to run with the land, it needs to meet certain criteria: it should be in writing, intended to run, notice (actual or constructive) to subsequent purchasers, and it must touch and concern the land, and there's privity between the original parties.

So, the developer's original deed had the covenant, and it was recorded. When he sold to the builder, the same covenant was in that deed, which was also recorded. So, the builder's deed included the restriction.

Now, when the builder sold the lots without including the covenant, what happens? Does the covenant still run with the land to the buyer?

I think that once a covenant is properly recorded, it's part of the property's record, so subsequent buyers would have constructive notice. So, even if the builder didn't include it in their deed, the buyer should have constructive notice because it's recorded.

Wait, but the developer's original subdivision plan was recorded. So, if the covenant was in the deeds that were recorded, then when the builder sold the lots, the covenants would still apply because they were already part of the property's title.

Wait, no. The initial 60 lots were sold with the covenant, and each of those deeds was recorded. Then the developer sells the remaining 40 to the builder, and that deed also includes the same covenant. So the builder's lots are also subject to the covenant.

When the builder sells those lots, even though he didn't include the covenant in the deed to the buyer, the covenant was already part of the property's chain of title because the developer's deed to the builder included it. So, the buyer would have constructive notice because the builder's deed was recorded with the covenant.

Wait, but the builder's deed to the buyer didn't include the covenant. So, does the buyer still have the covenant? Or does it not apply because the builder didn't include it?

Wait, no, the covenant runs with the land. So, even if the builder didn't mention it in their deed, the restriction is still there because it was already in the chain of title. So the buyer is bound by it.

But the question is about the buyer's deed. So, looking at the options, let's see.

The question is which statement is least accurate. Let me go through each option.

Option A: The buyer has no obligation to remove the mobile home. Hmm. If the covenant runs with the land, the buyer would be bound, so they would have an obligation. So if A says they have no obligation, that might be inaccurate. But I'm not sure yet.

Option B: All subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of contract. Wait, privity of contract is about being in the same contractual relationship. But for covenants to run with the land, it's privity of estate (horizontal privity) that's required. So, subsequent grantees wouldn't necessarily be in privity of contract with the original developer or the builder. So B might be inaccurate.

Option C: The deed from the builder to the buyer did not include the covenant. That's true, as per the scenario, so C is accurate. So it's not the least accurate.

Option D: The covenant ran with the land as far as the builder, but not as far as the buyer. That doesn't sound right. Because if it ran to the builder, and the builder's deed was recorded, then it should run further to the buyer. So D is inaccurate.

Option E: All subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of estate. Well, privity of estate refers to a mutual interest in the same property. So, when the builder sells to the buyer, there's vertical privity (chain of ownership). So, the buyer is in privity of estate with the builder. So E would be accurate. So E is correct, so not the least accurate.

Option F: The buyer should have had constructive notice. Since the covenant was recorded, yes, the buyer should have had constructive notice. So F is accurate.

Option G: The buyer had actual notice. The question doesn't say that the buyer knew, so G might be inaccurate. Because unless the builder told them or it was in their deed, they might not have actual notice. So G is possibly inaccurate.

Option H: The covenant could be enforced by any subdivision lot owner. Hmm. Once a covenant is established, typically any owner in the subdivision can enforce it, but it depends on the covenant's language. Since the covenant was intended to benefit the entire subdivision, other lot owners could enforce it. So H is accurate.

Option I: The covenant was not recorded. No, the developer's deed to the builder was recorded, so the covenant was recorded. So I is inaccurate. Because it was recorded, I is wrong.

Option J: The covenant could only be enforced by the original developer. No, because once it's a real covenant, any beneficiary can enforce it, not just the developer. So J is inaccurate.

Wait, but the original question is which statement is least accurate with respect to the buyer's deed.

Let me think again. The key is that the buyer's deed didn't include the covenant. But the covenant was in the builder's deed from the developer, which was recorded. So, the buyer, upon purchasing, would have constructive notice because it's in the chain of title.

So, looking at the options:

Option D says the covenant ran with the land as far as the builder but not the buyer. But that's incorrect because if it ran to the builder, it should continue to run to the buyer, provided the other elements are met.

Option I says the covenant wasn't recorded. But the developer's deed to the builder was recorded, so the covenant was recorded. So I is incorrect.

Option J says it can only be enforced by the developer. But that's wrong because other lot owners can enforce it too.

So, the question is which is least accurate. So let's look at each option.

The question is about the buyer's deed. So, which statement is least accurate regarding the buyer's deed.

Wait, the question is: which statement is least accurate with respect to the buyer's deed?

Wait, no, the question is which statement is least accurate regarding the buyer's deed. Or is it about the situation in general?

Wait, the question says: "Which of the following statements is LEAST accurate with respect to the buyer's deed?"

So, perhaps the statements relate to the buyer's deed.

Wait, no, the question is about the buyer's deed, but the options are about the situation in general. Hmm.

Wait, the options are about the situation, not directly about the deed itself. So, for example, some options talk about whether the covenant runs, whether the buyer had notice, etc.

So, the question is, which of these statements is least accurate concerning the buyer's deed.

Wait, but the buyer's deed didn't include the covenant, so the options that say the covenant doesn't apply to the buyer would be considering whether it's enforceable despite not being in the deed.

So, let me go through each option again.

Option A: The buyer has no obligation to remove the mobile home. If the covenant is enforceable against the buyer, then A would be incorrect. But if the covenant doesn't apply, then A is correct.

Option B: Subsequent grantees are in privity of contract. Well, the original covenant was between the developer and the builder, and then the builder and the buyer. The buyer isn't in privity of contract with the developer, so B is incorrect. But privity of contract isn't required for covenants to run with the land; privity of estate is.

Option C: Correct, as the deed didn't include the clause.

Option D: The covenant ran to the builder but not the buyer. But if the covenant runs with the land, it should run to the buyer as well. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Subsequent grantees are in privity of estate. Yes, because each grantee gets the land, so they have privity of estate with the prior owner. So E is correct.

Option F: Buyer has constructive notice. Yes, because the covenant was recorded in the builder's deed, so F is correct.

Option G: Buyer had actual notice. We don't know that, so G is incorrect.

Option H: Any subdivision owner can enforce. That's correct because the covenant benefits the entire subdivision.

Option I: The covenant wasn't recorded. No, because the developer's deed to the builder was recorded, so I is incorrect.

Option J: Only the developer can enforce. No, others can too, so J is incorrect.

Now, the question is which option is least accurate. So, which of these is incorrect.

Wait, the question is which statement is least accurate with respect to the buyer's deed. So, the least accurate is the incorrect statement about the situation.

So, the correct analysis is that the covenant does run with the land to the buyer because it was properly recorded, and the buyer has constructive notice. So, the buyer is bound and must remove the mobile home, making option A incorrect. But the question is which is least accurate.

Wait, the statements are about the situation, not the deed itself. So, for each option, which is least accurate.

Option I says the covenant wasn't recorded. But it was recorded in the developer's deed to the builder, so I is incorrect. So, I is the least accurate statement because it claims the covenant wasn't recorded when it was.

Wait, but the buyer's deed didn't include the covenant, but the builder's deed did. So, the covenant was recorded as part of the builder's title, so the buyer would have constructive notice.

So, the statements:

Option I: The covenant prohibiting mobile homes was not recorded with the county recorder's office.

But the developer's deed to the builder was recorded, which included the covenant. So the covenant was recorded. So I is incorrect.

Therefore, the least accurate statement is I.

Wait, but the question is about the buyer's deed. So, the buyer's deed didn't include the covenant, but the prior deed had it. So, the covenant was indeed recorded, making I incorrect.

So, the answer would be I.

Wait, but let me make sure. Which option is least accurate. The question is which statement is least accurate regarding the buyer's deed.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of each option again, focusing on the buyer's deed.

The buyer's deed from the builder didn't include the covenant. So, for the covenant to bind the buyer, it must have been in the chain of title, which it was because the developer's deed to the builder included it and was recorded. So the buyer has constructive notice.

So, option F says the buyer should have had constructive notice, which is correct. So F is accurate.

Option G says actual notice, which we don't know, so G is incorrect.

Option I says the covenant wasn't recorded, which is incorrect because the developer's deed was recorded.

So, among the options, I is incorrect, making it the least accurate.

Wait, but the question is about the buyer's deed. So, the options are about the situation in general. So, the least accurate statement is I, because the covenant was indeed recorded.

So, the correct answer is I.
</think>

To determine the least accurate statement regarding the buyer's deed, we must analyze the scenario and each option carefully. The developer included a restrictive covenant prohibiting mobile homes in the initial deeds to the first 60 lots and in the deed to the builder in 2003. These deeds were recorded, meaning the covenant became part of the chain of title. When the builder sold the remaining 40 lots, the deeds to the buyers did not include the covenant. However, because the covenant was already recorded in the developer's deed to the builder, it remained part of the property's title, and subsequent buyers like the one in 2009 would have constructive notice of the restriction.

### Analysis of Each Option:
- **A**: "The buyer has no obligation to remove the mobile home."  
  This is inaccurate because the covenant runs with the land and binds the buyer, even though it was not included in the buyer's deed. The buyer is obligated to comply with the restriction.

- **B**: "All subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of contract."  
  This is inaccurate because privity of contract is not required for a covenant to run with the land. Instead, privity of estate (a mutual interest in the property) is what matters.

- **C**: "The deed from the builder to the buyer did not include the covenant prohibiting mobile homes."  
  This is accurate. The scenario explicitly states that the builder's deeds to the buyers did not include the covenant.

- **D**: "The covenant prohibiting mobile homes ran with the land as far as the builder, but not as far as the buyer."  
  This is inaccurate. The covenant, being properly recorded and meeting the requirements to run with the land, should bind the buyer as well.

- **E**: "All subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of estate."  
  This is accurate. Subsequent grantees (like the buyer) are in privity of estate with the builder because they acquired the property directly from the builder.

- **F**: "The buyer should have had constructive notice of the restriction against mobile homes."  
  This is accurate. Since the covenant was recorded in the developer's deed to the builder, the buyer should have constructive notice of the restriction.

- **G**: "The buyer should have had actual notice of the restriction against mobile homes."  
  This is inaccurate. The scenario does not indicate that the buyer had actual notice, only that constructive notice should have existed.

- **H**: "The covenant prohibiting mobile homes could be enforced by any subdivision lot owner."  
  This is accurate. The covenant benefits the entire subdivision, so any lot owner can enforce it.

- **I**: "The covenant prohibiting mobile homes was not recorded with the county recorder's office."  
  This is inaccurate. The covenant was recorded in the developer's deed to the builder, making it part of the public record.

- **J**: "The covenant prohibiting mobile homes could only be enforced by the original developer."  
  This is inaccurate. The covenant can be enforced by any lot owner in the subdivision, not just the developer.

### Conclusion:
The least accurate statement is **I**, as the covenant was indeed recorded in the developer's deed to the builder, making it part of the chain of title.
