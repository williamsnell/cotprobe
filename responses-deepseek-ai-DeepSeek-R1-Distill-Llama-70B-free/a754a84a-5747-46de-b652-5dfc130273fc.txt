Okay, so I have this question about the Sungir' site and what the grave goods indicate about the children buried there. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that Sungir' is an archaeological site in Russia, and it's known for Upper Paleolithic remains. I think the site dates back around 30,000 years or so. From what I've read, Sungir' has some of the oldest examples of ritualistic burials, which is pretty significant.

The question specifically mentions children buried with grave goods. Grave goods are items placed in a tomb, which in many cultures are believed to serve the deceased in the afterlife. But what do these items indicate about the society?

Looking at the options:

Option A: The children were sometimes leaders of the tribe. That seems a bit off. I mean, if children were leaders, that's unusual. Most societies have adult leaders, especially in such ancient times. Plus, being buried with goods might not directly indicate leadership, unless it's a hereditary position. But I'm not sure if Sungir' evidence supports that.

Option B: The tribe had a complex system of inherited social statuses. Hmm. Grave goods can indicate social status, and if children have a lot, maybe it suggests that their status was inherited. Like, if a child is buried with rich goods, they might have been born into a high-status family. That would imply some level of social hierarchy or inherited status. This seems plausible.

Option C: The tribe was in an intricate trade network. Well, trade networks can be inferred from the origin of the goods. If the items came from far away, that suggests trade. But the question is about the amount of goods with children, not necessarily their origin. Unless the goods themselves are from distant places, but I don't think that's the main point here. So maybe not the best fit.

Option D: The tribe practiced ancestor worship, with goods as offerings. Ancestor worship does involve offerings to spirits, but is that what the grave goods at Sungir' indicate? I'm not too sure. I think the goods might be more about providing for the dead in the afterlife rather than worship. But I'm not certain.

Option E: The tribe spent most of their time carving beads. That seems too specific and not directly tied to the grave goods' implications. Plus, while beads are part of the goods, the question is about what the amount signifies, not the activity of making beads.

So, going back, the key here is the amount of grave goods with children. In many early human societies, the number and richness of grave goods correlate with the person's status. If children have a lot, it might mean they were born into a high-status family, suggesting inherited social status. That would support option B.

Wait, but I also recall that Sungir' had burials with elaborate goods, including beads and tools. One of the burials had a lot of beads on a child, which might indicate that the child's status wasn't achieved but ascribed, meaning they were born into it. So that would support a system where social status is inherited.

On the other hand, ancestor worship (option D) could involve leaving goods as offerings, but I think ancestor worship is more about ritualistic practices and reverence, not directly about the social structure.

So putting it all together, the presence of many grave goods with children likely points to an inherited social system, making option B the correct answer.

The amount of grave goods buried with the children at Sungir' suggests that the tribe had a complex system of inherited social statuses. The presence of rich and elaborate items in children's burials implies that their social status was ascribed at birth, indicating a hierarchical society where status was passed down through family lines rather than achieved. This aligns with the evidence of significant grave goods, which correlate with high status and suggest an inherited system.

Answer: B
