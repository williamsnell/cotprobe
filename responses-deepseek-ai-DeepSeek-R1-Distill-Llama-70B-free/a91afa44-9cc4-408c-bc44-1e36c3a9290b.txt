Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the free electron gas theory and estimating the average speed of valence electrons in copper. Hmm, I remember that the Fermi energy is involved. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem says that the average kinetic energy E is (3/5)E_F. Oh right, E_F is the Fermi energy, which for copper is 7 eV. So first, I'll calculate the average kinetic energy of the electrons.

Wait, energy in eV isn't in SI units, so I probably need to convert that into joules to use in kinetic energy formulas. The conversion factor is 1 eV = 1.602×10^-19 joules. So E = (3/5)*7 eV. Let me compute that: 3/5 of 7 is 4.2 eV. So the average kinetic energy is 4.2 eV.

But to find speed, I need to use the kinetic energy formula, which is (1/2)mv². Oh wait, m is the mass of an electron, right? The mass of an electron is about 9.11×10^-31 kg.

So, I'll convert 4.2 eV to joules. 4.2 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = let's see, 4.2 * 1.602 is approximately 6.7284, so 6.7284e-19 J. That's the kinetic energy.

Now, setting that equal to (1/2)mv². So,

KE = (1/2)mv²

I need to solve for v. So rearranging, v = sqrt( (2 KE) / m )

Plugging in the numbers:

KE is 6.7284e-19 J, so 2*KE is about 1.3456e-18 J.

Divide that by m (9.11e-31 kg): 1.3456e-18 / 9.11e-31 = approximately (1.3456 / 9.11) * 1e13. Let me compute 1.3456 / 9.11. Hmm, 9.11 goes into 1.3456 about 0.1475 times. So 0.1475e13 is 1.475e12 m²/s².

Taking the square root of that: sqrt(1.475e12) = approximately 1.215e6 m/s. Wait, because sqrt(1e12) is 1e6, sqrt(1.475) is about 1.214. So around 1.214e6 m/s.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 1.21e6 m/s. That matches. Option F is 2.6e6, which is too high. G is 2.2e6, also higher. So B seems right.

Wait, but wait, did I make a mistake in the calculations? Let me double-check.

Wait, KE = 4.2 eV converted to J: 4.2 * 1.602e-19 = 6.728e-19 J. Correct.

Then, 2*KE = 1.3456e-18 J. Then divide by m (9.11e-31 kg):

1.3456e-18 / 9.11e-31 = let's compute 1.3456 / 9.11 = approximately 0.1476. Then exponent is 10^(-18 - (-31))=10^(13). So 0.1476e13 = 1.476e12 m²/s².

Square root of 1.476e12 is sqrt(1.476)*1e6. Sqrt(1.476) is about 1.215. So 1.215e6 m/s. So option B is 1.21e6, which is very close.

I think that's correct. So the answer should be option B.

To estimate the average speed of the valence electrons in copper using the free electron gas theory, we start with the given relationship between the average kinetic energy \( E \) and the Fermi energy \( E_F \): 

\[
E = \frac{3}{5}E_F
\]

For copper, \( E_F = 7 \, \text{eV} \). Substituting this value:

\[
E = \frac{3}{5} \times 7 \, \text{eV} = 4.2 \, \text{eV}
\]

Next, we convert the kinetic energy from electron volts to joules using the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \):

\[
E = 4.2 \, \text{eV} \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV} = 6.7284 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
\]

The kinetic energy is related to the speed \( v \) of the electrons by the formula:

\[
E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
\]

Rearranging for \( v \):

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{2E}{m}}
\]

Here, \( m \) is the mass of an electron, \( m = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \). Substituting the values:

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 6.7284 \times 10^{-19}}{9.11 \times 10^{-31}}}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
2 \times 6.7284 \times 10^{-19} = 1.3456 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}
\]

Now divide by \( m \):

\[
\frac{1.3456 \times 10^{-18}}{9.11 \times 10^{-31}} = \frac{1.3456}{9.11} \times 10^{13} \approx 0.1476 \times 10^{13} = 1.476 \times 10^{12} \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v = \sqrt{1.476 \times 10^{12}} = \sqrt{1.476} \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Since \( \sqrt{1.476} \approx 1.215 \):

\[
v \approx 1.215 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Comparing this result to the options provided, the closest match is:

**B: \( 1.21 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s} \)**

Thus, the estimated average speed of the valence electrons in copper is approximately \( 1.21 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s} \).
