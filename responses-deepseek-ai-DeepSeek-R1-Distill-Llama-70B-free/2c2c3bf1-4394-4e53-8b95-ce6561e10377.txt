Question:

Fifty oranges of one variety were selected at random and weighed. A 95 percent confidence interval computed from the sample weights to estimate the mean weight of oranges of this variety is (7.58, 8.72) ounces. Which of the following statements is true with respect to the confidence level used?

Options:

A: In repeated samplings of the same size, 95 percent of the intervals constructed will contain the true mean weight of the oranges of this variety.
B: Ninety-five percent of the oranges of this variety weigh between 7.58 and 8.72 ounces.
C: In repeated samplings of the same size, 5 percent of the intervals constructed will contain the true mean weight of the oranges of this variety.
D: Ninety-five percent of the oranges in this sample weigh exactly 7.58 or 8.72 ounces.
E: In repeated samplings of the same size, 95 percent of the intervals constructed will contain the sampled mean weight of the oranges.
F: In repeated samplings of the same size, 95 percent of the oranges will weigh between 7.58 and 8.72 ounces.
G: In repeated samplings of the same size, 95 percent of the intervals constructed will exclude the true mean weight of the oranges of this variety.
H: Ninety-five percent of the oranges of this variety weigh exactly 7.58 or 8.72 ounces.
I: The interval (7.58, 8.72) ounces represents the range of all possible mean weights of the oranges of this variety.
J: Ninety-five percent of the oranges in this sample weigh between 7.58 and 8.72 ounces.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this statistics question. Let's see, the question is about confidence intervals, which I remember is a concept in inferential statistics. The setup is that 50 oranges were selected at random, and their weights were measured. Then, a 95% confidence interval was computed, which is (7.58, 8.72) ounces. The question is asking which statement about the confidence level is true.

Hmm, I need to recall what a confidence interval means. From what I remember, a confidence interval provides a range of values within which the true population parameter is expected to lie, based on the sample data. The confidence level, in this case, 95%, refers to the probability that the interval contains the true mean weight.

Wait, so if it's a 95% confidence interval, that means that if we were to take many samples (like repeated samplings of the same size), 95% of the resulting intervals would include the true mean. So each interval is constructed from a sample, and each has a 95% chance of containing the true mean.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that correctly describes this. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: In repeated samplings of the same size, 95 percent of the intervals constructed will contain the true mean weight. That sounds correct because the confidence level is the probability that the interval includes the parameter. So A could be the right choice.

Option B: 95% of the oranges weigh between 7.58 and 8.72. Wait, no, the confidence interval is about the mean, not individual oranges. So B is talking about individual data points, which is a common misunderstanding. So B is incorrect.

Option C: 5% of intervals contain the true mean. That's the opposite of what a 95% confidence means. So C is wrong.

Option D: 95% of oranges in the sample weigh exactly 7.58 or 8.72. No, because those are the endpoints of the interval, and the interval is a range for the mean, not individual weights. Also, exact points are probably not the case here. So D is wrong.

Option E: 95% of intervals will contain the sampled mean. Wait, the confidence interval is about the true population mean, not the sample mean. The sample mean is just a single value. So E is incorrect because it's about the true mean, not the sampled mean.

Option F: 95% of oranges will weigh between those values. Again, this is about individual oranges, not the mean. So F is wrong.

Option G: 95% of intervals exclude the true mean. That's the opposite of what a confidence interval does. If it's a 95% CI, 5% would exclude, so G is wrong.

Option H: 95% of oranges weigh exactly the endpoints. No, same as D, this is about individual data points, which isn't what the CI represents. So H is wrong.

Option I: The interval represents all possible mean weights. No, the confidence interval is an estimate based on the sample. It doesn't include all possible means, just a range that's likely to contain the true mean. So I is incorrect.

Option J: 95% of the sample oranges weigh between 7.58 and 8.72. Again, the CI is about the mean, not individual oranges. So J is wrong.

So the only correct statement is option A. It correctly describes that across repeated samplings, 95% of the intervals would include the true mean.

The question involves interpreting a 95% confidence interval for the mean weight of oranges. A confidence interval provides a range of values within which the true population parameter is expected to lie, based on sample data. The confidence level (95% in this case) indicates that if many samples of the same size were taken, 95% of the resulting intervals would contain the true mean weight.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Correct. It accurately states that in repeated samplings, 95% of the intervals will contain the true mean weight.
- **B**: Incorrect. The confidence interval pertains to the mean, not individual oranges.
- **C**: Incorrect. A 95% confidence interval means 95%, not 5%, of the intervals will contain the true mean.
- **D**: Incorrect. The interval represents the mean, not individual weights, and does not imply exact weights at the endpoints.
- **E**: Incorrect. The confidence interval is about the true population mean, not the sample mean.
- **F**: Incorrect. The interval is about the mean, not individual oranges.
- **G**: Incorrect. A 95% confidence interval means 5%, not 95%, of the intervals will exclude the true mean.
- **H**: Incorrect. The interval does not imply exact weights for individual oranges.
- **I**: Incorrect. The interval is an estimate, not a range of all possible mean weights.
- **J**: Incorrect. The interval pertains to the mean, not individual oranges.

The correct answer is **A**, as it accurately describes the interpretation of a 95% confidence interval.
