Question:

Dr. Ramchandran found that his patients who brushed their teeth after lunch had 1/20 the number of cavities in their teeth as those who didn't. After interviewing the dentist, a local newswriter reports that brushing teeth after lunch prevents cavities. Based on the dentist's research, which of the following statements is true?

Options:

A: The writer's statement would be justified if at least half of the patients brushed their teeth after lunch.
B: If a minimum of 200 patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified.
C: No matter how many participants, the writer's statement is not justified.
D: The writer's statement would only be justified if no patients brushed their teeth after lunch.
E: The writer's statement could only be justified if the study was conducted over a prolonged period of time.
F: At least 100 of the patients needed to have brushed their teeth after lunch for the writer's statement to be justified.
G: If all the patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified.
H: If at least 100 patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified.
I: If only the patients who brushed their teeth after lunch were studied, the writer's statement is justified.
J: If a minimum of 500 patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified.

Okay, so I've got this question about a study Dr. Ramchandran did on tooth brushing and cavities. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

From what I understand, Dr. Ramchandran found that patients who brushed their teeth after lunch had 1/20th the number of cavities compared to those who didn't. So the brushing group had much fewer cavities. Then a newswriter is reporting that brushing after lunch prevents cavities. The question is about whether the writer's statement is justified based on the dentist's research.

Hmm, wait. The dentist's study compared two groups: those who brushed after lunch and those who didn't. The results showed a significant difference, with the brushing group having much fewer cavities. But does this mean that brushing causes the reduction in cavities? Or could there be other factors at play?

I remember that correlation doesn't necessarily mean causation. Just because two things are related, it doesn't mean one causes the other. So in this case, maybe there's something else about the people who brush after lunch that reduces cavities. Like, perhaps they also brush more often in general, or use fluoride toothpaste, or have better overall dental hygiene. Those factors could influence the cavity rate, not just the single act of brushing after lunch.

So the writer is making a causal claim: brushing after lunch prevents cavities. But the study might not have controlled for other variables. Unless the study was a randomized controlled trial where participants were assigned to either brush or not brush after lunch, and all other factors were held constant, you can't be certain that brushing is the cause. 

Another thing to consider is the sample size. The question doesn't specify how many patients were in the study. If the sample was too small, the results might not be statistically significant, making the conclusion unreliable. But the writer's report doesn't mention that, they just state it as a fact.

Now looking at the options:

Option C says that no matter how many participants, the writer's statement isn't justified. That makes sense if the study wasn't controlled properly. Because without controlling for other variables, even a large sample size wouldn't establish causation. So the claim that brushing causes fewer cavities isn't justified unless the study's methodology supports it.

Other options talk about sample sizes. For example, option B says if at least 200 patients were studied, the statement is justified. But sample size alone doesn't address the issue of causality. So even 200 might not be enough if the study wasn't properly designed.

Option E mentions the study needing a prolonged period, but that's about duration, not about the variables controlled. So that's probably not the main issue here.

So putting it all together, the writer's statement assumes causation based on a correlation found in the study. Without proper controls, like a randomized experiment, the statement isn't justified regardless of the sample size. So option C is the correct answer because it points out that the statement isn't justified no matter the number of participantsâ€”since the study design doesn't support causation.

The question revolves around whether the newswriter's claim that brushing teeth after lunch prevents cavities is justified based on Dr. Ramchandran's study. The study found that patients who brushed their teeth after lunch had 1/20th the number of cavities compared to those who did not. However, the study's design and the writer's causal claim must be carefully analyzed.

The writer assumes a causal relationship between brushing after lunch and cavity prevention. However, correlation does not necessarily imply causation. Without a randomized controlled trial that isolates brushing after lunch as the sole variable and controls for other factors (e.g., overall dental hygiene, fluoride use, or brushing frequency), the claim of causation remains unjustified. Additionally, the question does not provide information about the sample size or study duration, but even a large sample size or prolonged study period would not address the lack of control over confounding variables.

Option C correctly states that no matter how many participants were studied, the writer's statement is not justified because the study's methodology does not establish causation. Other options focus on sample size or study duration, but these factors do not resolve the fundamental issue of uncontrolled variables and correlation being mistaken for causation.

Answer: C
