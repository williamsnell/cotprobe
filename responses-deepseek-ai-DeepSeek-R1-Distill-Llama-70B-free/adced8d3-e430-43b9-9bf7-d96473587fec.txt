Question:

Which of the following best accounts for the negative slope of the liquid-solid equilibrium line in the phase diagram for water?

Options:

A: H2O(s) has a greater density than H2O(l), which is the result of the van der Waals forces between water molecules.
B: H2O(s) has a lower density than H2O(l) which results from the crystalline framework that forms due to hydrogen bonds.
C: H2O(s) has a lower density than H2O(l) which causes the solid to form liquid under low pressure conditions.
D: H2O(s) has a lower density than H2O(l), this is caused by the metallic bonds formed between water molecules.
E: H2O(s) has a lower density than H2O(l), which causes the solid to form liquid under high pressure conditions.
F: H2O(s) has a lower density than H2O(l), which is a result of the covalent bonds formed between water molecules.
G: H2O(s) has a greater density than H2O(l), which results from the hydrogen bonds formed between water molecules.
H: H2O(s) has a greater density than H2O(l), which results in the solid forming liquid under low pressure conditions.
I: H2O(s) has a greater density than H2O(l), which is due to the ionic bonds formed between water molecules.
J: H2O(s) has a greater density than H2O(l), which causes the solid to form liquid under high pressure conditions.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the liquid-solid equilibrium line in the phase diagram for water has a negative slope. Hmm, I remember that phase diagrams show how substances change between solid, liquid, and gas phases under different pressures and temperatures. The slope of the lines between these phases is related to how pressure and temperature affect the phase transitions.

Wait, I think the general case is that for most substances, the solid is denser than the liquid. So when you increase pressure, which squeezes the molecules together, the substance would favor the denser phase. For most liquids, when pressure increases, the melting point increases because the solid is denser. So the solid-liquid line would have a positive slope because higher pressure means higher melting point.

But water is different. I remember that ice floats on water, which means ice is less dense than liquid water. So for water, the solid is less dense than the liquid. So when pressure increases, what happens? Since the solid is less dense, applying more pressure would favor the denser phase, which is the liquid. So increasing pressure would cause the solid to melt. That means the melting point decreases with increasing pressure. So the phase diagram line would slope to the left, meaning negative slope.

So the question is about why this negative slope occurs. The options probably explain this based on density and the reasons behind it.

Looking at the options:

Option A: H2O(s) has greater density than H2O(l) due to van der Waals. That can't be right because we know ice is less dense. And van der Waals are a type of intermolecular force, but I think hydrogen bonds are more important in water.

Option B: H2O(s) has lower density than H2O(l) because of crystalline framework from hydrogen bonds. That sounds right. Hydrogen bonds form a more open structure in ice, making it less dense.

Option C: Lower density causes solid to form liquid under low pressure. Wait, no, lower pressure would mean ice is more favored? Or wait, under lower pressure, the solid (ice) is less dense, so when pressure increases, ice melts. So option C says under low pressure, solid forms liquid. Wait, I'm a bit confused. High pressure favors the denser phase. So if ice is less dense, high pressure would make it melt. So under high pressure, ice turns to liquid. Option E says under high pressure, solid forms liquid. That makes sense because high pressure would make the solid (ice) melt into liquid water.

Wait, the question is about why the line has a negative slope. The slope is negative because as pressure increases, the melting temperature decreases. So the explanation should involve the solid being less dense than the liquid, and this is because of hydrogen bonding creating a more open structure.

So looking at the options again:

Option B explains that H2O(s) is less dense than H2O(l) because of hydrogen bonds. So that seems correct.

But the question is about the best account for the negative slope. So the negative slope is due to the solid being less dense. So the correct option should state that.

Looking at the options:

Option B says H2O(s) has lower density than H2O(l), which is because of the crystalline framework from hydrogen bonds. That's correct.

Option E says H2O(s) has lower density, causing solid to form liquid under high pressure. That's also correct but it's more about the effect rather than the reason for the slope.

Wait, the question is about why the slope is negative. The slope is negative because when pressure increases, the melting point decreases. That happens when the solid is less dense than the liquid. So the correct option must state that the solid is less dense and explain why.

So among options, B and E are in play.

Option B: H2O(s) has lower density due to hydrogen bonds. So this explains why the solid is less dense, leading to the negative slope.

Option E: The consequence is that solid forms liquid under high pressure, which is true but the question is about why the slope is negative.

The question is about which option best accounts for the negative slope. So the reason is that the solid is less dense. So the correct statement is that H2O(s) has lower density than H2O(l), and this is due to hydrogen bonds.

So the correct answer is B.

The negative slope of the liquid-solid equilibrium line in the phase diagram for water occurs because water is an anomaly among substances. Typically, solids are denser than liquids, and increasing pressure raises the melting point. However, for water, the solid phase (ice) is less dense than the liquid phase due to the open, crystalline framework formed by hydrogen bonds. This means that when pressure increases, the denser liquid phase is favored, causing the melting point to decrease. This behavior results in the negative slope of the liquid-solid equilibrium line.

Among the options provided, the best explanation is that H₂O(s) has a lower density than H₂O(l) due to the hydrogen bonds that create a more open structure in ice. This directly accounts for the negative slope of the phase diagram.
