Okay, so I've got this problem here about toothpaste tubes and their prices and volumes. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit confused, but I'll take it slow.

First, let's list out all the information given:

1. Bright is 60% more expensive than Fresh.
2. Bright has 25% less volume than Glow.
3. Glow is 25% less expensive than Bright.
4. Glow has 33 1/3% more volume than Fresh.
5. Fresh costs $1.00 per unit of volume.

And the question is asking for the number of cents per unit of volume of Glow. So, we need to find the price per volume for Glow in cents.

Wait, let me clarify the units. The final answer needs to be in cents per unit volume, and Fresh is $1.00 per unit. So, Fresh is 100 cents per unit. That's a starting point.

Let me assign variables to make this easier. Let's let:

- F_price = price of Fresh
- F_vol = volume of Fresh

Similarly, B_price and B_vol for Bright, G_price and G_vol for Glow.

But wait, the problem doesn't give me the actual volumes or prices except in relation to each other and Fresh's price per volume. So I think I can express everything in terms of Fresh.

Wait, Fresh's price per volume is $1.00, so F_price_per_volume = $1.00. So, the total price of Fresh would be F_vol * 1.00. But I don't know F_vol yet.

Let me think about the relations.

First, Bright is 60% more expensive than Fresh. So, the price of Bright is Fresh's price plus 60% of Fresh's price. So, B_price = F_price + 0.6 * F_price = 1.6 * F_price.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Is the price per tube or per unit volume? Because the problem says Fresh costs $1.00 per unit of volume. So, when they talk about the price of the tubes, it's the total price for the entire tube, which depends on both the price per volume and the volume of the tube.

Wait, I might have to model this more carefully.

Let me think again. Let's define:

- Let F_vol be the volume of Fresh's tube.
- Then, the total price of Fresh is F_vol * $1.00 per unit volume. So F_price = F_vol * 1.

Similarly, Bright's price per unit volume is something we might need to find, but perhaps it's better to express everything in terms of F_vol.

Wait, perhaps I should assign variables in terms of Fresh's tube.

Wait, let's define:

Let’s say the volume of Fresh is V units.

Then, the price of Fresh is V * $1.00 = $V.

But wait, no, that would make the price vary with the volume, which doesn't make sense. Because if Fresh's volume increases, its price would increase, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the price per unit volume as a separate variable.

Wait, let me try a different approach.

Let’s let the volume of Fresh be F_vol. Then, the price per unit volume of Fresh is $1.00, so the total price of Fresh is F_price = F_vol * 1.00.

Now, let's look at Bright. The problem says that Bright is 60% more expensive than Fresh. So, the total price of Bright is B_price = F_price + 0.6 * F_price = 1.6 * F_price.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, that's if the price of Bright is 60% higher in total. But perhaps that's correct. So B_price = 1.6 * F_price.

Also, Bright has 25% less volume than Glow. So, B_vol = G_vol - 0.25 * G_vol = 0.75 * G_vol. So B_vol = 0.75 G_vol.

Next, Glow is 25% less expensive than Bright. So, G_price = B_price - 0.25 B_price = 0.75 B_price.

Also, Glow has 33 1/3% more volume than Fresh. 33 1/3% is 1/3, so G_vol = F_vol + (1/3) F_vol = (4/3) F_vol. So G_vol = (4/3) F_vol.

Hmm, okay, so let's put these together.

We have:

1. B_price = 1.6 F_price
2. B_vol = 0.75 G_vol
3. G_price = 0.75 B_price
4. G_vol = (4/3) F_vol

Also, F_price = F_vol * $1.00 (since Fresh is $1.00 per unit volume).

So, let me try expressing everything in terms of F_vol.

From point 4: G_vol = (4/3) F_vol.

From point 2: B_vol = 0.75 G_vol = 0.75 * (4/3 F_vol) = (3/4)*(4/3) F_vol = F_vol.

So B_vol = F_vol. Interesting, so Bright's volume is same as Fresh's.

Wait, that's a bit unexpected, but let's go with it.

Now, F_price = F_vol * 1.00.

Then, B_price = 1.6 F_price = 1.6 * F_vol.

G_price = 0.75 B_price = 0.75 * 1.6 F_vol = 1.2 F_vol.

Now, what's G_price? G_price is the total price of Glow, which is G_price = G_vol * (G_price_per_vol).

Wait, no, G_price is the total price. So, G_price = G_vol * (price per unit volume for Glow). Let me call that price G_ppu.

So, G_ppu = G_price / G_vol.

We need to find G_ppu in cents per unit volume. Since Fresh is $1.00 per unit, which is 100 cents, so we'll convert G_ppu to cents at the end.

So, G_ppu = G_price / G_vol.

We have G_price = 1.2 F_vol.

And G_vol = (4/3) F_vol.

So, G_ppu = (1.2 F_vol) / (4/3 F_vol) ) = (1.2) / (4/3) ) = 1.2 * (3/4) ) = 0.9.

Wait, so G_ppu is $0.90 per unit, which is 90 cents.

So the answer would be H: 90.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Let me go through each step again.

1. F_vol is the volume of Fresh.

2. G_vol = (4/3) F_vol.

3. B_vol = 0.75 * G_vol = 0.75 * (4/3) F_vol = (3/4)*(4/3) = 1, so B_vol = F_vol.

4. F_price = F_vol * $1.00.

5. B_price = 1.6 * F_price = 1.6 F_vol.

6. G_price = 0.75 * B_price = 0.75 * 1.6 F_vol = 1.2 F_vol.

7. G_ppu = G_price / G_vol = (1.2 F_vol) / (4/3 F_vol) ) = (1.2) / (4/3) ) = 1.2 * 3/4 = 0.9 dollars per unit, which is 90 cents.

So yes, that looks correct. The answer should be H:90.

To solve the problem, we analyze the relationships between the prices and volumes of the toothpaste tubes. Let’s define the following variables:

- **F_vol**: Volume of Fresh.
- **F_price**: Total price of Fresh.
- **B_vol**: Volume of Bright.
- **B_price**: Total price of Bright.
- **G_vol**: Volume of Glow.
- **G_price**: Total price of Glow.
- **G_ppu**: Price per unit volume of Glow (in dollars).

### Step 1: Express volumes in terms of F_vol
1. **Glow's volume**: Glow has 33⅓% more volume than Fresh, so:
   \[
   G_{\text{vol}} = F_{\text{vol}} + \frac{1}{3}F_{\text{vol}} = \frac{4}{3}F_{\text{vol}}
   \]
2. **Bright's volume**: Bright has 25% less volume than Glow, so:
   \[
   B_{\text{vol}} = G_{\text{vol}} - 0.25G_{\text{vol}} = 0.75G_{\text{vol}}
   \]
   Substituting \( G_{\text{vol}} = \frac{4}{3}F_{\text{vol}} \):
   \[
   B_{\text{vol}} = 0.75 \cdot \frac{4}{3}F_{\text{vol}} = F_{\text{vol}}
   \]
   Thus, \( B_{\text{vol}} = F_{\text{vol}} \).

### Step 2: Express prices in terms of F_price
1. **Fresh's price**: Fresh costs $1.00 per unit volume, so:
   \[
   F_{\text{price}} = F_{\text{vol}} \cdot 1.00 = F_{\text{vol}}
   \]
2. **Bright's price**: Bright is 60% more expensive than Fresh, so:
   \[
   B_{\text{price}} = F_{\text{price}} + 0.6F_{\text{price}} = 1.6F_{\text{price}}
   \]
   Substituting \( F_{\text{price}} = F_{\text{vol}} \):
   \[
   B_{\text{price}} = 1.6F_{\text{vol}}
   \]
3. **Glow's price**: Glow is 25% less expensive than Bright, so:
   \[
   G_{\text{price}} = B_{\text{price}} - 0.25B_{\text{price}} = 0.75B_{\text{price}}
   \]
   Substituting \( B_{\text{price}} = 1.6F_{\text{vol}} \):
   \[
   G_{\text{price}} = 0.75 \cdot 1.6F_{\text{vol}} = 1.2F_{\text{vol}}
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate Glow's price per unit volume
The price per unit volume of Glow is:
\[
G_{\text{ppu}} = \frac{G_{\text{price}}}{G_{\text{vol}}}
\]
Substituting \( G_{\text{price}} = 1.2F_{\text{vol}} \) and \( G_{\text{vol}} = \frac{4}{3}F_{\text{vol}} \):
\[
G_{\text{ppu}} = \frac{1.2F_{\text{vol}}}{\frac{4}{3}F_{\text{vol}}} = \frac{1.2}{\frac{4}{3}} = 1.2 \cdot \frac{3}{4} = 0.9 \, \text{dollars per unit volume}
\]
Converting to cents:
\[
G_{\text{ppu}} = 0.9 \cdot 100 = 90 \, \text{cents per unit volume}
\]

### Final Answer:
The number of cents per unit of volume of Glow is **90**.
