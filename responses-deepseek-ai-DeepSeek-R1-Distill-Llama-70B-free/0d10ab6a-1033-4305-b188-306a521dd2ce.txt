Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about rectal bleeding, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Hmm, let's go through each option step by step.

First, the question is asking which statement is true about rectal bleeding. The options are from A to J. I remember that rectal bleeding can be caused by various conditions, some more serious than others.

Option A: Hemorrhoids are never a cause of rectal bleeding. Wait, that doesn't sound right. I think hemorrhoids are a common cause of rectal bleeding. They can cause bright red blood, especially when they're external. So A is probably false.

Option B: A painful digital examination suggests an anal fissure. That makes sense. Anal fissures are small tears in the lining of the anus, and they usually cause sharp pain during bowel movements. A digital exam would likely be painful if someone has a fissure, so B might be true.

Option C: A colonoscopy is not necessary if rectal bleeding is present. No, that can't be right. Colonoscopy is a key diagnostic tool for rectal bleeding because it can detect more serious issues like polyps or colorectal cancer, especially in older patients or those with other symptoms. So C is false.

Option D: Rectal cancer is the commonest cause of rectal bleeding. I don't think that's correct. Rectal cancer is a possible cause, but more common causes are hemorrhoids, anal fissures, or diverticulosis. So D is false.

Option E: Bright red blood on the finger usually signifies a caecal lesion. Wait, bright red blood typically comes from a lower gastrointestinal source, like the rectum or anus. Caecal lesions are higher up in the colon, and blood from there would likely be darker or even black (like melena). So E is probably false.

Option F: Rectal bleeding is always a sign of cancer. No, definitely not. Most rectal bleeding is due to non-cancerous issues like hemorrhoids. So F is false.

Option G: Proctoscopy is of no value in the assessment of rectal bleeding. Proctoscopy allows visualization of the rectum and lower colon, so it's definitely useful. G is false.

Option H: Rectal bleeding is not a symptom of diverticulosis. Wait, diverticulosis can sometimes cause bleeding, especially when the small blood vessels in the diverticula burst. So H is false because it can be a symptom.

Option I: Rectal bleeding is always accompanied by pain. No, that's not true. For example, in cases of colorectal cancer or internal hemorrhoids, the bleeding might not cause pain. So I is false.

Option J: A negative colonoscopy rules out all causes of rectal bleeding. I don't think so. A colonoscopy can miss some lesions, especially if the preparation wasn't good or if the source is outside the colon. Also, conditions like angiodysplasia might not always be seen. So J is false.

Wait, going back to option B. If a digital exam is painful, it suggests an anal fissure. Alternatively, conditions like an abscess or thrombosed hemorrhoid could also cause pain. But in the context of rectal bleeding, a painful digital exam is more indicative of an anal fissure. So B is true.

So after going through each option, the correct answer should be B.

The correct answer is:

B: A painful digital examination suggests an anal fissure.

Answer: B
