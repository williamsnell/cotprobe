Question:

This question refers to the following information.
The man who mounted the steps of the Capitol, March 4, 1801, to claim the place of an equal between Pitt and Bonaparte, possessed a character which showed itself in acts; but person and manner can be known only by contemporaries, and the liveliest description was worth less than a moment of personal contact. Jefferson was very tall, six feet two-and-a-half inches in height; sandy-complexioned; shy in manner, seeming cold; awkward in attitude, and with little in his bearing that suggested command.… His skin was thin, peeling from his face on exposure to the sun, giving it a tettered appearance. This sandy face, with hazel eyes and sunny aspect; this loose, shackling person; this rambling and often brilliant conversation, belonged to the controlling influences of American history, more necessary to the story than three-fourths of the official papers, which only hid the truth. Jefferson's personality during these eight years appeared to be the government, and impressed itself, like that of Bonaparte, although by a different process, on the mind of the nation. In the village simplicity of Washington, he was more than a king, for he was alone in social as well as in political pre-eminence. Except the British Legation, no house in Washington was open to general society; the whole mass of politicians, even the Federalists, were dependent on Jefferson and "The Palace" for amusement; and if they refused to go there, they "lived like bears, brutalized and stupefied."

Alright, so I've got this history question here about Henry Adams and his perspective on Thomas Jefferson. I'm a bit rusty on my American history, but I'll try to think this through.

First, I remember that Henry Adams was a historian and the great-grandson of John Adams. John Adams was one of the Founding Fathers and the second President of the United States. He was a Federalist, right? So, Henry Adams comes from a Federalist family.

The question is asking what we might expect Henry Adams' perspective to be based on this. The options are about being supportive or critical of certain policies or people.

Looking at the passage provided, it's from Henry Adams' History of the United States. He's describing Jefferson's personality and influence. The passage doesn't explicitly say whether Adams supports Jefferson or not. But I know that historians' family backgrounds can sometimes influence their perspectives.

Since John Adams was a Federalist and had a complicated relationship with Jefferson—like during the 1800 election where Jefferson won—there might have been some rivalry. So, perhaps Henry Adams, being a descendant, might have been critical of Jefferson's policies.

Wait, but the passage doesn't directly show criticism. It describes Jefferson as having a significant influence and being the controlling force of the government. But the question is about what we might expect, not necessarily what's in the passage.

So, considering family ties, Henry Adams might be expected to be critical of Jefferson, especially since Jefferson was a Democratic-Republican and Adams a Federalist. Therefore, the options are looking for an expectation based on his lineage.

Looking at the options, D says "Critical of the policies of Thomas Jefferson" and J is "Biased towards the Federalists." Since John Adams was a Federalist, Henry might be biased towards Federalist views, which would make him critical of Jefferson's policies.

Wait, but the question is about being expected to be which of the following. So, would it be more about being supportive of John Adams' policies or critical of Jefferson's?

Option C is "Supportive of the policies of John Adams." But the question is about Henry Adams' perspective on Jefferson, not his perspective on his own ancestor.

Alternatively, the question is about what we might expect from Henry Adams given his background. As John Adams' descendant, he might be more critical of Jefferson. So, option D is about being critical of Jefferson's policies, which makes sense.

But I'm a bit confused between options C, D, and J. Option J is about being biased towards the Federalists. Since John Adams was a Federalist, Henry might have been biased that way. But the question is about what he might have been expected to be, so it's more about his stance towards Jefferson.

I think the correct answer is D: Critical of the policies of Thomas Jefferson. Because as a Federalist descendant, he might not have agreed with Jefferson's Democratic-Republican policies.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The passage describes Jefferson's influence but doesn't show overt criticism. However, the question is about what we might expect, not necessarily what's in the passage. So, based on family ties, yes, he might be critical.

The question asks what we might expect from Henry Adams, given that he was the great-grandson of President John Adams. John Adams was a Federalist and had a complicated relationship with Thomas Jefferson, who was a Democratic-Republican. Historians are often influenced by their family backgrounds, and as a descendant of a Federalist president, Henry Adams might be expected to be critical of Jefferson's policies, which were politically opposed to those of the Federalists.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, H, and I** are less relevant because they focus on aspects like social dynamics, political landscapes, or events unrelated to the Adams-Jefferson political divide.
- **C (Supportive of John Adams' policies)** and **J (Biased towards the Federalists)** are plausible, but the question specifically asks about Henry Adams' stance toward Jefferson, not his support for his ancestor or political alignment.
- **D (Critical of Jefferson's policies)** aligns with the expectation that, as a Federalist descendant, Henry Adams might disapprove of Jefferson's Democratic-Republican policies.
- **E and F** are unlikely, as indifference or support for Jefferson would contradict the family's political legacy.
- **G (Supportive of the British Legation)** is unrelated to the context of the question.

Given the family ties and political opposition, the most reasonable expectation is that Henry Adams would be **critical of Thomas Jefferson's policies**.

Answer: D
