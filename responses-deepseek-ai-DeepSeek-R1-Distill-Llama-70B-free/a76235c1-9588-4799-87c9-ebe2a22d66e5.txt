Okay, so I have this problem about a spherical shell made of cast iron. The shell has an inner radius of 2.5 inches and an outer radius of 6 inches. Inside the shell, there's a solution that generates heat at a rate of 0.8×10^5 Btu/hr. The outside surface is kept at 120°F. I need to find the temperature at r=5 inches, assuming steady state and constant thermal conductivity.

Hmm, I remember that for spherical shells and heat transfer, the Fourier's law in spherical coordinates might be useful here. Oh right, the heat equation in spherical coordinates for steady-state with spherical symmetry. So the general approach would be to find the temperature distribution as a function of radius.

Wait, since it's a shell without any angular dependence, the problem should be one-dimensional, depending only on r. So the heat equation would be something like:

d²T/dr² + (2/r)(dT/dr) = 0, but wait, that's for no heat generation. Oh but in this case, there is heat generation inside the solution, so maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no, the solution is inside the shell, so the heat is generated within the inner radius. So the spherical shell itself conducts the heat from the inner solution to the outer surface.

Wait no, the shell itself doesn't generate heat. The solution inside the shell generates heat. So the heat is produced in the inner region, and the shell conducts it outward.

So the heat generation is happening inside the cavity (r < 2.5 in.), but the shell (2.5 in. < r <6 in.) conducts the heat. So within the shell, there's no heat generation except possibly in the case where the shell itself is generating heat? No, the problem says the solution liberates heat, so the shell itself doesn't generate heat. So the heat generation is only in the inner part, but the shell is just conducting it.

Wait, but in that case, the heat flux through the shell must be equal to the heat generated by the solution. So the heat generated Q is 0.8e5 Btu/hr, and that must equal the heat conducted through the shell.

Wait, the heat conducted through the shell is given by Fourier's law, but in spherical coordinates. The formula is Q = -k * 4π r² * dT/dr, where r is the radius at which we're calculating the flux.

Since the problem is steady-state and the shell is spherical, the heat flux through any radius r should be the same, equal to the heat generated.

Wait, but the heat generated is within r < 2.5 inches, so for the shell, the heat flux across the shell is equal to the heat generated. So, the heat conducted through the shell is equal to Q = 0.8e5 Btu/hr.

So, the approach is to set up the heat flux equation for the shell. The heat flux at any point in the shell is Q = -k * 4π r² (dT/dr). But since the heat is flowing outward, dT/dr is negative, so Q is positive.

So, Q = k * 4π r² (dT/dr) * (-1), but perhaps I should be careful with signs. Alternatively, since the temperature decreases with r (as heat flows from high to low), dT/dr is negative, so Q would be positive when considering the magnitude.

Let me rearrange the equation. So, dT/dr = - Q/(4π k r²). Since Q is positive, dT/dr is negative, which makes sense.

Integrate this to get T as a function of r. The integral of dT = (-Q/(4π k)) * (1/r²) dr.

So integrating from r = r1 (2.5 in) to r = r2 (6 in), but wait, the boundary conditions are T at r=6 inches is 120°F. But wait, what about the temperature at r=2.5 inches? That's the inner surface of the shell, which I don't have a value for. Hmm.

Wait no, the heat is generated inside the solution, which is inside r=2.5 in. So the heat generated must flow through the shell. So the heat flux at r=2.5 inches is Q = 0.8e5 Btu/hr.

So integrating dT/dr from r1 to r2:

dT = (-Q/(4π k)) * (1/r²) dr

Integrate both sides:

T(r) = T(r1) + (Q/(4π k)) * (1/r1 - 1/r) )

Wait, let me check the integration. The integral of 1/r² dr is -1/r + C. So when you integrate dT from r1 to r, you get:

T(r) - T(r1) = (Q/(4π k)) * (1/r1 - 1/r )

Wait, because dT/dr is negative, the integral would be positive when considering the absolute value.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me write the equation correctly.

We have:

dT/dr = - Q/(4π k r² )

So to find T(r) in terms of T(r1), we can integrate from r = r1 to r = r, and T goes from T(r1) to T(r).

So:

∫(from T(r1) to T(r)) dT = ∫(from r1 to r) [ - Q/(4π k r'^2) ] dr'

So:

T(r) - T(r1) = [ Q/(4π k ) ] * (1/r' ) evaluated from r1 to r.

Wait, let me compute the integrals properly. The integral of (1/r'^2) dr' is -1/r' + C.

So:

T(r) = T(r1) + [ Q/(4π k) ) * ( -1/r' ) ] evaluated from r1 to r.

Wait, that would be:

T(r) = T(r1) + [ Q/(4π k) ) * ( -1/r + 1/r1 ) ]

Which simplifies to:

T(r) = T(r1) + (Q/(4π k)) (1/r1 - 1/r )

Wait, that seems right.

But I have two unknowns here: T(r1) and T(r2). Because at r2=6 in, T(r2)=120°F.

So I can write another equation for r=r2:

T(r2) = T(r1) + (Q/(4π k)) (1/r1 - 1/r2 )

But I don't know T(r1). Hmm, perhaps there's another condition.

Wait, but the heat flux into the shell at r1 must be equal to the heat generated by the solution. Oh wait, no, the shell isn't generating heat. The solution inside the cavity generates the heat, and that heat is conducted through the shell. So the heat flux at r=r1 (2.5 in) is Q = 0.8e5 Btu/hr.

Wait, but that's the same as the heat flux through the entire shell. So the heat conducted through the shell is Q, which is 0.8e5 Btu/hr.

So, using this, and the boundary condition at r2, I can find T(r1).

Let me write the equation for the entire shell. So, the temperature difference across the shell is:

T(r1) - T(r2) = (Q/(4π k)) (1/r1 - 1/r2 )

Wait, no, from the earlier equation, T(r) = T(r1) + (Q/(4π k)) (1/r1 - 1/r )

At r = r2, T(r2) = T(r1) + (Q/(4π k)) (1/r1 - 1/r2 )

So, T(r1) = T(r2) - (Q/(4π k)) (1/r1 - 1/r2 )

Wait, that can't be right because the term (1/r1 -1/r2) is positive since r1 < r2. So T(r1) would be less than T(r2), which can't be correct because heat flows from higher to lower temperature. So if the outer surface is 120°F, then the inner surface (r1) must be hotter, so T(r1) should be higher than T(r2).

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the sign. Let me recheck the integration.

We have dT/dr = - Q/(4π k r² )

Integrating from r1 to r:

T(r) = T(r1) + ∫(r1 to r) dT = T(r1) - (Q/(4π k)) ∫(r1 to r) (1/r'^2) dr'

The integral of 1/r'^2 dr' is [ -1/r' ] from r1 to r.

So,

T(r) = T(r1) - (Q/(4π k)) [ (-1/r) + (1/r1) ) ]

Which is:

T(r) = T(r1) + (Q/(4π k)) (1/r1 - 1/r )

Ah, that's correct. So at r=r2, T(r2) = T(r1) + (Q/(4π k)) (1/r1 - 1/r2 )

Wait, but wait, in the shell, the heat is flowing outwards, so T(r1) must be higher than T(r2), which is 120°F. So when I plug in r=r2, the term (1/r1 - 1/r2) is positive because r1 < r2. So T(r2) would be higher than T(r1) if that term is positive, which contradicts expectations. So that suggests I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, perhaps I should have the equation as:

dT/dr = - Q/(4π k r² )

So integrating from r1 to r2, the temperature at r2 is lower than at r1.

Wait, perhaps I should set up the equation again.

Let me think: The heat flux Q is the rate at which heat flows through the shell, which is the same at every radius in the shell. So,

Q = -k * 4π r² (dT/dr )

But since dT/dr is negative (temperature decreases with r), the negative sign makes Q positive.

So,

Q = k * 4π r² ( -dT/dr )

Which can be rearranged as:

dT/dr = - Q/(4π k r² )

Now, to get T as a function of r, we integrate from r1 to some r in the shell.

So the change in temperature from r1 to r is:

T(r) - T(r1) = ∫ (from r1 to r) dT = ∫ (from r1 to r) [ -Q/(4π k r'^2) ] dr'

So,

T(r) = T(r1) - (Q/(4π k)) ∫ (r1 to r) (1/r'^2) dr'

The integral of 1/r'^2 dr' is -1/r' + C. So,

T(r) = T(r1) - (Q/(4π k)) [ (-1/r ) - (-1/r1) ) ]

Simplify:

T(r) = T(r1) - (Q/(4π k)) [ (1/r1 - 1/r) ]

Which can be written as:

T(r) = T(r1) + (Q/(4π k)) ( 1/r - 1/r1 )

Wait, that makes more sense. Because when r increases, 1/r decreases, so the term (1/r - 1/r1) is negative, so T(r) decreases as r increases, which is correct.

So, at r=r2, T(r2)=120°F. So,

120 = T(r1) + (Q/(4π k )) (1/r2 - 1/r1 )

Wait, because if I plug r=r2 into T(r):

T(r2) = T(r1) + (Q/(4π k )) (1/r2 - 1/r1 )

So,

T(r1) = 120 - (Q/(4π k )) (1/r2 - 1/r1 )

Wait, let's compute the value step by step.

Given:

Q = 0.8e5 Btu/hr.

k =45 Btu/hr-ft-°F

r1 =2.5 inches, but we need to convert to feet because the units in k are per foot.

Wait, yes, because the units of k are in ft, so the radius must be in feet.

So, 2.5 inches is 2.5/12 ft = 0.208333 ft.

Similarly, r2=6 inches = 0.5 ft.

Wait, but wait, 6 inches is 6/12 = 0.5 ft.

So, let's compute the term (1/r2 - 1/r1 ):

1/r2 = 1/0.5 = 2 ft^-1,

1/r1 = 1/0.208333 ≈ 4.8 ft^-1,

So,

1/r2 - 1/r1 = 2 - 4.8 = -2.8 ft^-1.

So,

(Q/(4 π k )) (1/r2 -1/r1) ) = (0.8e5) / (4 * π * 45) ) * (-2.8)

Compute the numbers:

0.8e5 = 80000.

Denominator: 4 * π *45 ≈ 4 *3.1416 *45 ≈ 4 *141.372 ≈ 565.488.

So,

80000 / 565.488 ≈ let's compute that.

80000 /565.488 ≈ approximately 141.372 (since 565.488 * 141.372 ≈ 80,000? Wait, 565 * 141 is about 565*140=79,100, plus 565=79,665. So approximately 141.37.

So,

(80000)/(4 pi 45 ) ≈ 141.37.

Then multiply by (-2.8):

141.37 * (-2.8) ≈ -395.84.

So,

T(r1) = 120 - ( -395.84 ) = 120 + 395.84 = 515.84°F.

Wait, that's a very high temperature. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, let me recheck the calculation:

The term (1/r2 -1/r1 ) is 2 - 4.8 = -2.8, correct.

So, (Q/(4 pi k )) * (1/r2 -1/r1 ) = (80000 / (4 pi 45 )) * (-2.8 )

Compute 4 pi 45: 4 * 3.1416 *45 = 4 * 141.372 ≈ 565.488.

80000 / 565.488 = approximately 141.372.

Multiply by -2.8: 141.372 * (-2.8) ≈ -395.84.

So, T(r1) = 120 - ( -395.84 ) = 515.84°F.

Wait, that's a huge temperature. But considering the units, perhaps I made a mistake in unit conversion.

Wait, let's double-check the units.

k is given as 45 Btu/(hr-ft-°F). So, the units are correct.

Q is 0.8e5 Btu/hr.

r1 is in feet: 2.5 inches is 2.5/12 = 0.208333 ft.

r2 is 6 inches = 0.5 ft.

So, yes, the units are correct.

So, T(r1) is 515.84°F.

Wait, that seems really high. Let me think again. Wait, the shell is conducting the heat generated, so the inside of the shell (r=2.5 in) must be hotter than the outside, which is 120°F. So 515°F seems plausible? Maybe, but I'm not sure. Let's proceed.

Now, the question is to find the temperature at r=5 inches. So r=5 inches is 5/12 ft ≈ 0.416667 ft.

We can plug this into the temperature equation.

T(r) = T(r1) + (Q/(4 pi k )) (1/r - 1/r1 )

So,

T(0.416667) = 515.84 + (141.372 ) * ( 1/0.416667 - 1/0.208333 )

Compute 1/0.416667 = 2.4, and 1/0.208333≈4.8.

So,

(2.4 -4.8) = -2.4.

Multiply by 141.372: 141.372 * (-2.4) ≈ -339.25.

So,

T(r=5 in) = 515.84 -339.25 = 176.59°F.

Looking at the options, option A is 176°F, which is very close.

But wait, perhaps I made a rounding error in the calculations. Let me recheck.

Wait, let me compute (1/r - 1/r1) at r=5 inches.

r=5 inches =5/12 ft ≈0.416667 ft.

1/r ≈2.4 ft^-1.

1/r1=1/0.208333≈4.8 ft^-1.

So,

1/r -1/r1 ≈2.4 -4.8 =-2.4.

Multiply by (Q/(4 pi k ))= (0.8e5)/(4 pi 45) = (80000)/(565.487) ≈141.37.

So,

141.37 * (-2.4) ≈-339.25.

So,

T(r=5)=515.84 -339.25=176.59°F.

So approximately 176.6°F, which rounds to 177°F, but the closest option is A:176°F.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of T(r1). Let me recheck that step.

Wait, the initial calculation for T(r1):

T(r1) = 120 - [ (Q/(4 pi k )) * (1/r2 -1/r1 ) ]

Wait, no, earlier I had T(r1) = 120 - (Q/(4 pi k )) * (1/r2 - 1/r1 )

Wait, no, from the equation:

120 = T(r1) + (Q/(4 pi k )) (1/r2 -1/r1 )

So,

T(r1) = 120 - (Q/(4 pi k )) (1/r2 -1/r1 )

Which is:

120 - (141.37) * (-2.8) = 120 + (141.37 *2.8 )

Wait, wait no, 1/r2 -1/r1 is -2.8, so (1/r2 -1/r1
