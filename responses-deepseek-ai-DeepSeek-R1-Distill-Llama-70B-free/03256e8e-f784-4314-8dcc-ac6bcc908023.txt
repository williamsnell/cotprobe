Okay, so I've got this problem here where James Taggert wants to paint his storage room, and I need to figure out how much it's going to cost him. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to find out the area of the walls that need painting. The room's dimensions are given as 14 feet by 10 feet by 8.5 feet. Wait, the height is 8 and a half feet, so that's 8.5 feet. 

I remember that the area of the four walls in a rectangular room can be calculated by finding the perimeter of the floor and then multiplying by the height. The formula is 2*(length + width) * height. But wait, no, that would give the total area of all four walls. Let me think: the room has two walls of each pair of dimensions. So for the length and width walls.

So, the two longer walls are 14 feet each, and the height is 8.5 feet. Each of these walls has an area of 14 * 8.5. Then there are the two shorter walls, which are 10 feet each, so their area is 10 * 8.5 each. 

Calculating each part:
- For the long walls: 2 walls * (14 ft * 8.5 ft) = 2 * 119 = 238 sq.ft.
Wait, 14 *8.5 is 119? Let me check: 14 *8 is 112, and 14*0.5 is 7, so 112 +7=119. So yes, 119 per wall, times two makes 238.

For the short walls: 2 walls * (10 ft *8.5 ft) = 2 * 85 = 170 sq.ft.

So total wall area is 238 +170 = 408 square feet. 

Wait, but what about the ceiling and the floor? The problem says he's painting the walls, so I think the ceiling and floor aren't included. So 408 sq.ft. is correct.

Next, I need to figure out how much paint he needs. Each quart covers 36 square feet. So I'll divide the total area by 36 to find the number of quarts needed.

408 /36 = let's calculate. 36*11 is 396, which leaves 12. So 11 quarts would cover 396 sq.ft., but we have 12 left. So he needs 12 quarts? Wait, no, wait: 36 * 11.333... So 11.333 quarts. But since you can't buy a fraction of a quart, you have to round up. So 12 quarts total.

Wait, 36 * 11 = 396. 408 -396 =12. So 11 quarts cover 396, and the remaining 12 requires another quart. So 12 quarts total.

Each quart costs $9.80, so the cost for paint is 12 *9.80 = let's see. 10 quarts would be 98, and 2 quarts would be 19.60, so 98 + 19.60=117.60. So $117.60 for the paint.

Now, the labor cost. It's $5 per quart or any fraction thereof. So for each quart used, you pay $5, even if it's a fraction. Since he used 12 quarts, the labor cost is 12 *5= $60.

Wait, but the problem says "or fraction thereof". So if he uses a fraction of a quart, he still has to pay for the full quart. But in this case, since we needed 12 quarts, whether partial or full, each counts as a quart. So the labor is $5 per quart used, regardless of how much is actually used. So 12 quarts *5=60.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The problem says "labor costs is $5 per quart or fractionthere of." So for each quart, even if you use a part of it, you pay $5. But in this case, since the total quarts needed is 12, you have 12 quarts, so whether each is partial or full, each counts as a quart. So total labor is 12*5=60.

So total cost is paint cost + labor cost =117.60 +60 =177.60.

Looking at the options, option D is $177.60.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in the wall area.

Wait, the room is 14x10x8.5. So the perimeter is 2*(14+10)=2*24=48 feet. Multiply by height 8.5: 48*8.5 = 408 sq.ft. That's correct.

Paint needed: 408/36=11.333, so 12 quarts. Paint cost:12*9.80= 117.60.

Labor: 12*5=60. Total 177.60, which is option D.

Hmm, but wait, I've got a doubt. Does the labor cost apply per quart of paint purchased, or per quart used? Because sometimes, if you have leftover paint, you might not have to pay for it. But the problem says "labor cost is $5 per quart or fraction there of." So I think it's per quart used, meaning each quart you use, whether fully or partially, you pay $5. So if you use 12 quarts, you pay 12*5=60.

Alternatively, maybe the labor cost is per quart purchased. But in this case, you can't buy a fraction, so you have to buy 12 quarts, so it's same either way.

So I think the calculation is correct. So the answer should be D: $177.60.

To determine the total cost for James Taggert to paint his storage room, we start by calculating the area of the walls. The room dimensions are 14' by 10' by 8.5', and the walls consist of two pairs of identical walls. The total wall area is calculated as follows:

1. **Area of the long walls**:  
   Each long wall is \(14 \, \text{ft} \times 8.5 \, \text{ft} = 119 \, \text{sq.ft.}\)  
   Two long walls: \(2 \times 119 = 238 \, \text{sq.ft.}\)

2. **Area of the short walls**:  
   Each short wall is \(10 \, \text{ft} \times 8.5 \, \text{ft} = 85 \, \text{sq.ft.}\)  
   Two short walls: \(2 \times 85 = 170 \, \text{sq.ft.}\)

3. **Total wall area**:  
   \(238 + 170 = 408 \, \text{sq.ft.}\)

Next, we calculate the amount of paint required. One quart of paint covers \(36 \, \text{sq.ft.}\), so the number of quarts needed is:  
\[
\frac{408}{36} = 11.333 \, \text{quarts.}
\]  
Since partial quarts are rounded up, James needs \(12 \, \text{quarts}\) of paint.

**Cost of Paint**:  
Each quart costs $9.80, so the total cost for paint is:  
\[
12 \times 9.80 = 117.60.
\]

**Labor Cost**:  
Labor is charged at $5 per quart or fraction thereof. Since James uses \(12 \, \text{quarts}\), the labor cost is:  
\[
12 \times 5 = 60.
\]

**Total Cost**:  
The total cost is the sum of the paint cost and labor cost:  
\[
117.60 + 60 = 177.60.
\]

Thus, the total cost for painting the room is **$177.60**, which corresponds to option **D**.
