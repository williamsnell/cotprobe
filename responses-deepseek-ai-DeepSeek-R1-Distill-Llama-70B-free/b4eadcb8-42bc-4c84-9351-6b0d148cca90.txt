Question:

A 44-year-old woman with a 10-year history of arthritis comes to the office because she has had increasing pain and stiffness in her hands, wrists, and knees during the past several months. She also has had increasing fatigue for the past month, along with a weight loss of 1.8 to 2.2 kg (4 to 5 lb). She has seen numerous physicians for her arthritis in the past and has tried various medications and devices, including copper bracelets from Mexico given to her by friends. Review of her medical records confirms that the initial diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is correct. She says, "I had several drop attacks during the past 3 months." She characterizes these attacks as episodes of weakness and loss of feeling in her legs for several minutes. During one of these episodes, she became incontinent. She currently takes aspirin approximately four times daily and ibuprofen occasionally. Physical examination shows facial plethora and swollen and painful metacarpophalangeal and knee joints, bilaterally. There is moderate ulnar deviation of the fingers. The remainder of the examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her "drop attacks?"

Options:

A: Side effect of the copper bracelets
B: Spinal stenosis
C: Reaction to aspirin or ibuprofen
D: Cardiac arrhythmia
E: Anxiety
F: Transient ischemic attack
G: Adrenal insufficiency
H: Hypoglycemia
I: Atlanto-axial instability

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the cause of this woman's "drop attacks." Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the patient is a 44-year-old woman with a 10-year history of arthritis, specifically rheumatoid arthritis (RA). She's been having increasing pain and stiffness in her hands, wrists, and knees for a few months. Also, she's experienced fatigue and weight loss recently. She's tried various medications and even some alternative treatments like copper bracelets.

She mentions having several drop attacks over the past three months. These episodes are described as weakness and loss of feeling in her legs, each lasting a few minutes. During one episode, she became incontinent. That's concerning because incontinence might indicate a loss of nerve control, possibly from a neurological issue.

Her current medications are aspirin four times daily and ibuprofen occasionally. The physical exam shows facial plethora, which makes me think of something causing increased blood flow or pressure in the face. Her joints are swollen and painful, with ulnar deviation—classic signs of RA, especially in the hands. Ulnar deviation is when the fingers drift toward the little finger, which is a common deformity in RA.

So the main issue here is identifying the cause of the drop attacks. Drop attacks are sudden falls without loss of consciousness. They can be due to various reasons like neurological issues, orthopedic problems, or even cardiac causes.

Looking at the options:

A: Side effect of copper bracelets. I'm not sure about copper toxicity, but I don't think copper bracelets are known to cause such episodes. Maybe they're a distractor here.

B: Spinal stenosis. Spinal stenosis can cause neurogenic claudication, which leads to pain and weakness in the legs when walking, relieved by rest. But the episodes here are sudden, not related to activity, and she loses feeling. Not sure if that fits.

C: Reaction to aspirin or ibuprofen. NSAIDs can cause GI issues, but I don't think they cause acute neurological episodes like drop attacks. Maybe if she had a GI bleed leading to anemia and fainting, but that's different. The incontinence during the episode makes it more of a neurological event.

D: Cardiac arrhythmia. Arrhythmias can cause syncope (fainting), which is a sudden loss of consciousness. But in this case, she describes episodes of weakness and loss of feeling without necessarily losing consciousness. So maybe not the best fit.

E: Anxiety. Anxiety can cause various symptoms, but drop attacks and incontinence don't seem typical of anxiety attacks. More likely panic attacks might present with different symptoms.

F: Transient ischemic attack (TIA). TIAs are like mini-strokes and can cause sudden weakness or numbness, but they usually don't cause drop attacks without other focal neurological deficits. Also, TIAs don't typically cause incontinence unless it's a more severe stroke.

G: Adrenal insufficiency. This can cause fatigue, weight loss, and possibly hypotension leading to dizziness or fainting. But the sudden leg weakness and incontinence seem more acute than what adrenal insufficiency would present.

H: Hypoglycemia. Low blood sugar can cause weakness, sweating, confusion, and even loss of consciousness. But again, the incontinence and the specific leg-related symptoms might not align perfectly.

I: Atlanto-axial instability. This is a condition where the joint between the atlas (C1) and axis (C2) in the neck is unstable. It's associated with RA because chronic inflammation can erode the ligaments and joints in the cervical spine. Atlanto-axial instability can lead to spinal cord compression, causing sudden episodes of weakness, numbness, and even loss of bladder control. These episodes might be triggered by certain neck movements. The drop attacks she's experiencing could be due to transient spinal cord compression affecting the lower limbs.

So putting it all together, her RA could be causing atlanto-axial instability, leading to neurological symptoms during certain movements. That makes option I the most likely cause.

The patient is a 44-year-old woman with a 10-year history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), presenting with increasing pain, stiffness, fatigue, and weight loss. She reports "drop attacks" characterized by sudden leg weakness, loss of feeling, and incontinence. These episodes suggest a neurological cause. Her RA diagnosis is confirmed, and she has tried various medications, including aspirin and ibuprofen, without relief.

Key considerations for the cause of her drop attacks include:

- **A: Copper bracelets** are unlikely to cause such episodes, as there is no known mechanism linking them to neurological symptoms.
- **B: Spinal stenosis** typically causes pain and weakness related to activity, not sudden episodes with incontinence.
- **C: Reactions to aspirin or ibuprofen** are more associated with gastrointestinal or systemic side effects, not acute neurological events.
- **D: Cardiac arrhythmia** could cause syncope, but the patient describes leg weakness and incontinence without loss of consciousness, making this less likely.
- **E: Anxiety** does not typically present with drop attacks or incontinence.
- **F: Transient ischemic attack (TIA)** usually causes focal neurological deficits and is less likely to cause isolated leg weakness with incontinence.
- **G: Adrenal insufficiency** can cause fatigue and hypotension but does not explain the sudden neurological symptoms.
- **H: Hypoglycemia** leads to systemic symptoms like confusion and sweating, not localized leg weakness and incontinence.
- **I: Atlanto-axial instability** is a known complication of RA, where inflammation erodes cervical spine structures, potentially causing spinal cord compression. This can result in sudden episodes of leg weakness, numbness, and incontinence, consistent with the patient’s symptoms.

Given her history of RA and the nature of her symptoms, the most likely cause of her drop attacks is atlanto-axial instability due to cervical spine involvement in RA.
