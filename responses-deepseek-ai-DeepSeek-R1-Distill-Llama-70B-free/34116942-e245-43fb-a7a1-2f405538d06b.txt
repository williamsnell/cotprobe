Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about identifying the incorrectly named chemical compound from a list of options. Let me think through each option one by one.

First, I need to remember some basic nomenclature rules for chemistry. I think the key here is to correctly match the chemical formulas to their proper names, making sure things like the oxidation states are correct and that the prefixes are used appropriately.

Let's look at each option:

A: MgO is magnesium oxide. Magnesium is Mg, and oxygen is O. Mg is a group 2 metal, so it forms Mg²+ ions. Oxide is O²⁻, so MgO is correct. So A is correctly named.

B: AgNO3 is silver nitrate. Silver is Ag, which is a +1 ion. Nitrate is NO3⁻, so AgNO3 makes sense. Silver nitrate is a common compound, so B is correct.

C: CuCl2 is copper(II) chloride. Copper can have different oxidation states. Cu²+ is the +2 state, so the Roman numeral II is correct. So copper(II) chloride is right. C seems correct.

D: H2SO4 is sulfuric acid. That's definitely correct. The formula for sulfuric acid is H2SO4, so D is right.

E: K2Cr2O7 is potassium dichromate. Wait, dichromate is Cr2O7²⁻. The name potassium dichromate is correct because K+ is the cation and Cr2O7²⁻ is the anion. So E is correct.

F: Na2SO4 is sodium sulfate. Sodium is Na+, and sulfate is SO4²⁻. So yes, sodium sulfate is correct. F is correct.

G: Fe(NO3)3 is iron(III) nitrate. Iron can have different oxidation states. Fe³+ would mean it's iron(III). Nitrate is NO3⁻, so the formula Fe(NO3)3 makes sense. So G is correct.

H: CaCl2 is calcium chloride. Calcium is Ca²+, and Cl⁻ is chloride. So CaCl2 is correct. H is correct.

I: AlBr3 is aluminum tribromide. Aluminum is Al³+ and bromide is Br⁻. So AlBr3 would be aluminum bromide, but wait, when the metal is fixed in its oxidation state, sometimes the prefix is used. Oh wait, for nonmetals with fixed charges, like Br here which is -1, the prefix is used for the anion. So AlBr3 is aluminum tribromide. So I is correct. Wait, but wait another thing. I think sometimes when the anion has only one possible charge, the prefix is used. So Br is always -1, so bromide would be used with the prefix tri. So the correct name is aluminum tribromide, so I is correct.

J: Zn(NO3)2 is zinc nitrate. Zinc typically has +2 charge. So Zn(NO3)2 would make sense because NO3 is -1, so two of them make -2. So the formula is correct. So J is zinc nitrate, which is correct.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check each one. Did I miss any?

Hmm, so all the options from A to J seem correctly named except maybe one. Wait, I thought maybe I had a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each again.

Option C: CuCl2 is copper(II) chloride. That's correct. Cu²+ is copper(II), so right.

Option E: K2Cr2O7 is potassium dichromate, correct.

Option G: Fe(NO3)3 is iron(III) nitrate. Yes, because Fe³+ and three nitrates.

Wait, but wait. Let me check option I again. AlBr3 would be aluminum bromide. Oh wait, no, wait. Aluminum has a +3 charge. So each Br is -1. So three Br⁻ would balance the +3. So the formula is AlBr3. Now, the naming. For ionic compounds with a fixed charge, the anion uses a prefix if it comes from a nonmetal with more than one possible charge. Wait, bromine is always -1. So in that case, the name would be aluminum bromide, not tribromide. Because for anions with only one possible charge, we don't use the prefix. Oh wait, I think I might have been wrong earlier.

Wait, for example, NaCl is sodium chloride, not sodium monochloride. Because Cl⁻ is only -1. Similarly, AlCl3 is aluminum chloride, not trichloride. So same with AlBr3: it's aluminum bromide, not tribromide. So in option I, the name given is aluminum tribromide, which would be incorrect. It should just be aluminum bromide.

So option I is incorrectly named. So the answer should be I.

Wait, but why the other options are correct. Let me confirm with other examples. Like, AlCl3 is named aluminum chloride. So yes, the same applies to AlBr3. So the correct name is aluminum bromide, not tribromide. So option I is wrong.

So the answer is I.

To determine which compound is incorrectly named, let us analyze each option based on standard chemical nomenclature rules:

- **A: MgO** - Magnesium oxide. Correct, as Mg²⁺ and O²⁻ combine to form MgO.  
- **B: AgNO3** - Silver nitrate. Correct, as Ag⁺ and NO3⁻ combine to form AgNO₃.  
- **C: CuCl2** - Copper(II) chloride. Correct, as Cu²⁺ and two Cl⁻ ions form CuCl₂.  
- **D: H2SO4** - Sulfuric acid. Correct, as this is the standard name for H₂SO₄.  
- **E: K2Cr2O7** - Potassium dichromate. Correct, as K⁺ and Cr₂O₇²⁻ combine to form K₂Cr₂O₇.  
- **F: Na2SO4** - Sodium sulfate. Correct, as Na⁺ and SO₄²⁻ combine to form Na₂SO₄.  
- **G: Fe(NO3)3** - Iron(III) nitrate. Correct, as Fe³⁺ and three NO₃⁻ ions form Fe(NO₃)₃.  
- **H: CaCl2** - Calcium chloride. Correct, as Ca²⁺ and two Cl⁻ ions form CaCl₂.  
- **I: AlBr3** - Aluminum tribromide. **Incorrect**, as Al³⁺ and three Br⁻ ions form AlBr₃, which should be named aluminum bromide, not aluminum tribromide. The prefix "tri-" is unnecessary when the anion (Br⁻) has a fixed charge.  
- **J: Zn(NO3)2** - Zinc nitrate. Correct, as Zn²⁺ and two NO₃⁻ ions form Zn(NO₃)₂.  

The incorrectly named compound is **I: AlBr3**, as it should be called aluminum bromide, not aluminum tribromide.

**Answer: I**
