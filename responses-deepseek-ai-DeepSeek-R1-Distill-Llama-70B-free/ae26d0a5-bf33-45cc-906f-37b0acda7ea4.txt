Okay, so I have this finance problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these calculations. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem lists four different debts, each with different payment structures and due dates. I need to find the annual amount required to pay off all these debts over 15 years, considering the given interest rates.

First, let me list out each debt and the details:

(a) 10 annual mortgage payments of $1,000. So each year, a payment of $1k is made. But wait, since the mortgage is being paid annually, I think this is a series of payments. I need to find the present value of these payments to see how much of the total debt they represent.

(b) 12 monthly payments of $100 on an automobile. The nominal annual interest rate is 12%. Oh wait, the problem says the nominal rate is used for the automobile loan and the effective rate is used for others. So for the automobile, it's a nominal rate, which probably means I have to convert it to an effective monthly rate.

(c) A bill for $2,000 due in two years. Since it's due in the future, I need to find its present value as well.

(d) A bill for $1,000 due today. That's straightforward because it's already in present value terms.

Wait, no, (d) is due today, so it's already a present value. So I don't need to discount that. But (c) is due in two years, so I have to discount it back to the present.

The overall plan is to calculate the present value of each debt and then sum them up. Then, find the annual payment needed over 15 years to pay off that total present value, considering the effective annual interest rate of 12%.

Wait, but the automobile loan has a nominal rate. So the effective rate for each monthly payment is different. Let me get this straight.

The problem says: use an annual interest rate of 12 percent (nominal rate on the automobile loan and effective rate on all other debts). So:

- For (b), the automobile loan, the rate is 12% nominal annual, compounded monthly I assume. So the effective rate per month would be 12% / 12 = 1% per month.

- For all other debts (a, c, d), the interest rate is the effective annual rate of 12%. So when calculating present values for (a), (c), and (d), I should use the effective rate of 12% annually.

But wait, for the mortgage (a), the payments are annual, so the interest would be applied annually as well.

So, the process is:

1. Calculate the present value (PV) of each debt (a, b, c, d).
2. Sum all the PVs to get the total amount that needs to be paid off.
3. Calculate the annual payment (A) required to pay off this total PV over 15 years, using the effective annual rate of 12%.

Let me tackle each debt one by one.

Starting with debt (a): 10 annual mortgage payments of $1,000 each.

This is an ordinary annuity because payments are made at the end of each period (year). The interest rate is 12% effective annual.

The PV of an ordinary annuity is given by PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

Where PMT is $1,000, r is 0.12, n is 10.

So plugging in:

PV_a = 1000 * [ (1 - (1.12)^-10 ) / 0.12 ]

I need to calculate (1.12)^-10 first. Let me compute that.

(1.12)^10 ≈ 6.7275, so (1/6.7275) ≈ 0.1486.

So 1 - 0.1486 = 0.8514.

Divide by 0.12: 0.8514 / 0.12 ≈ 7.095.

Multiply by 1000: 7095. So PV_a is approximately $7,095.

Wait, but let me double-check the exact value. Maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps using the present value of annuity factor.

The annuity factor for 12% over 10 years is:

(1 - v^n)/r, where v = 1/(1+r) = 1/1.12.

v^10 = (1/1.12)^10 ≈ 0.3220.

Wait, no, wait: 1.12^10 is approximately 6.7275, as I said earlier, so 1/6.7275 is about 0.1486. So 1 - 0.1486 = 0.8514. Divided by 0.12 gives about 7.095. So yes, 7.095 * 1000 = 7095.

So PV_a ≈ $7,095.

Next, debt (b): 12 monthly payments of $100 on automobile. Nominal rate is 12% annually, so the monthly rate is 1% (12/12=0.01).

Since it's an installment loan, the payments are made at the end of each month (ordinary annuity).

The PV for this would be calculated using the monthly rate. PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + i)^-n ) / i ]

Where PMT = $100, i = 0.01, n=12.

So:

PV_b = 100 * [ (1 - (1.01)^-12 ) / 0.01 ]

Compute (1.01)^-12: 1/(1.01)^12 ≈ 1/1.1268 ≈ 0.8874.

So 1 - 0.8874 = 0.1126.

Divide by 0.01: 11.26.

Multiply by 100: 1126.

So PV_b ≈ $1,126.

Wait, let me compute (1.01)^12 more accurately. Because 1.01^12 is approximately 1.126825... So reciprocal is approx 0.88696.

So 1 - 0.88696 = 0.11304.

Divide by 0.01 gives 11.304. So 11.304 * 100 = 1,130.4. So PV_b ≈ $1,130.40.

Hmm, but some might approximate it as $1,126, but perhaps I should be more precise. Let's say approximately $1,130.40.

Debt (c): a bill for $2,000 due in two years. Since it's a single sum, I need to find its present value at 12% effective annual rate.

PV = FV / (1 + r)^n = 2000 / (1.12)^2.

(1.12)^2 = 1.2544.

So 2000 / 1.2544 ≈ 1594.37.

So PV_c ≈ $1,594.37.

Debt (d): $1,000 due today. So PV_d = $1,000.

Now, summing all PVs:

PV_total = PV_a + PV_b + PV_c + PV_d.

Plugging in the numbers:

PV_total ≈ 7,095 + 1,130.40 + 1,594.37 + 1,000.

Let me add them step by step.

7,095 + 1,130.40 = 8,225.40.

8,225.40 + 1,594.37 = 9,819.77.

9,819.77 + 1,000 = 10,819.77.

So total present value is approximately $10,819.77.

Now, I need to find the annual payment (let's call it A) that will pay off this total over 15 years, with an effective annual interest rate of 12%.

This is an ordinary annuity because payments are made at the end of each year.

The formula to find A is:

PV_total = A * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

We can rearrange this to solve for A:

A = PV_total / [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

Plugging in the numbers:

r = 0.12, n=15.

First, compute (1 + 0.12)^-15.

1.12^15 is approximately 4.4399. So 1/4.4399 ≈ 0.2249.

So 1 - 0.2249 = 0.7751.

Divide by 0.12 gives 0.7751 / 0.12 ≈ 6.459.

So denominator is approximately 6.459.

Now, A = 10,819.77 / 6.459 ≈ ?

Let me compute that.

10,819.77 / 6.459 ≈ let's see.

6.459 × 1,675 = let's see. 6 × 1,675 = 10,050. 0.459 × 1,675 ≈ 768. So total approx 10,050 + 768= 10,818.

So 6.459 × 1,675 ≈ 10,818, which is very close to our PV_total of 10,819.77.

So A is approximately $1,675.

Wait but looking at the answer options, option G is $1,600, and others are lower. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in one of the steps.

Wait let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the present value calculations.

Let me re-calculate each PV carefully.

Starting again:

Debt (a): 10 annual payments of $1,000 at 12% effective annual.

PV_a = 1000 * [ (1 - (1.12)^-10 ) / 0.12 ]

Compute (1.12)^-10:

1.12^10 ≈ 6.7275, so 1/6.7275 ≈ 0.14864.

1 - 0.14864 = 0.85136.

0.85136 / 0.12 ≈ 7.0947.

So 7.0947 * 1000 = 7,094.70.

So PV_a = $7,094.70.

Debt (b): 12 monthly payments of $100 at 12% nominal, so 1% per month.

PV_b = 100 * [ (1 - (1.01)^-12 ) / 0.01 ]

Compute (1.01)^12:

1.01^12 = approx 1.126825.

So (1 - 1/1.126825) = (1 - 0.887449) = 0.112551.

Divide by 0.01: 11.2551.

Multiply by 100: 1,125.51.

So PV_b = $1,125.51.

Debt (c): $2,000 due in 2 years.

PV_c = 2000 / (1.12)^2 = 2000 / 1.2544 ≈ 2000 / 1.2544.

Compute 1.2544 × 1594.37 = 2000, so yes, 2000/1.2544 ≈ 1594.37.

So PV_c = $1,594.37.

Debt (d): $1,000 today, so PV_d = $1,000.

Now sum them up:

7,094.70 + 1,125.51 = 8,220.21.

8,220.21 + 1,594.37 = 9,814.58.

9,814.58 + 1,000 = 10,814.58.

So PV_total = $10,814.58.

Now, find A where A is paid annually for 15 years at 12% effective annual rate.

The present value of an ordinary annuity is A * [ (1 - (1.12)^-15 ) / 0.12 ].

Compute (1.12)^-15:

1.12^15 ≈ 4.4399, so 1/4.4399 ≈ 0.2249.

So 1 - 0.2249 = 0.7751.

0.7751 / 0.12 ≈ 6.45925.

So the denominator is approximately 6.45925.

Thus, A = 10,814.58 / 6.45925 ≈ ?

Let me compute 10,814.58 ÷ 6.45925.

Let me see, 6.45925 × 1,675 = ?

6.45925 × 1,600 = 10,334.2.

6.45925 × 75 = approx 6.45925 *70=452.148; 6.45925*5=32.296. So total ≈ 484.444.

So 10,334.2 + 484.444 = 10,818.644.

Which is very close to 10,814.58. So perhaps 1,674.

Wait, but 6.45925 * 1,674 = ?

Wait, perhaps I should do a more accurate division.

Compute 10,814.58 ÷ 6.45925.

Let me compute 6.45925 × 1,674: 6 × 1,674 = 10,044. 0.45925×1,674 ≈ let's compute 0.4*1674=669.6; 0.05925*1674≈ 99.2. So total ≈ 669.6+99.2=768.8. So 10,044 +768.8=10,812.8.

Which is close to our PV of 10,814.58.

So 1,674 gives 10,812.8, which is a bit less than 10,814.58.

The difference is 10,814.58 -10,812.8=1.78.

Each additional dollar contributes 6.45925 to the product. So 1.78 /6.45925 ≈ 0.276.

So approximately 1,674 + 0.276 ≈ 1,674.28.

So A ≈ $1,674.28 per year.

Looking at the options, the closest is option G: $1,600.00, but that's lower. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me check the sum again.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the sum of the present values. Let me add them again.

PV_a = 7,094.70

PV_b = 1,125.51

PV_c = 1,594.37

PV_d = 1,000.00

Sum: 7,094.70 + 1,125.51 = 8,220.21

8,220.21 + 1,594.37 = 9,814.58

9,814.58 + 1,000.00 = 10,814.58.

That's correct.

Hmm, so the annual payment is about $1,674.28, but the options don't have that. Let me look at the options again.

Options are:

A: $1,225.00

B: $1,500.00

C: $1,580.42

D: $1,250.00

E: $1,450.00

F: $1,375.69

G: $1,600.00

H: $1,700.00

I: $1,305.75

J: $1,520.34

Wait, none of the options is about $1,674. The closest is H: $1,700.00, but that's higher than my calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in one of the present values.

Let me double-check each present value calculation.

Debt (a):

n=10, r=12%, PMT=1,000.

PV = 1,000 * [(1 - (1.12)^-10)/0.12]

(1.12)^10 = 6.7275, so 1/6.7275=0.14864.

1 - 0.14864=0.85136.

0.85136 / 0.12=7.094666...

Multiply by 1,000: 7,094.67. So that's correct.

Debt (b):

n=12, i=1%, PMT=100.

PV = 100 * [(1 - (1.01)^-12)/0.01]

(1.01)^12=1.12682503, so 1/1.12682503=0.887449.

1 - 0.887449=0.112551.

0.112551 / 0.01=11.2551.

Multiply by 100: 1,125.51. Correct.

Debt (c):

FV=2,000, n=2, r=12%.

PV=2000/(1.12)^2=2000/1.2544=approx 1,594.39.

Wait, let me compute 1.12 squared exactly.

1.12 * 1.12 = 1.2544.

So 2000 ÷ 1.2544 = let's compute that.

1.2544 × 1594 = 1.2544 × 1500=1881.6; 1.2544 ×94=117.6816. So total approx 1881.6+117.68=1999.28. Close to 2000. So 1,594.37 is correct.

Debt (d): 1,000, so correct.

So the sum is indeed 10,814.58.

Now, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the annual payment.

Let me compute A again.

A = PV_total / [ (1 - v^15 ) / r ]

Where v=1/(1.12)= approx 0.892857.

v^15 = (1/1.12)^15.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator approach:

(1.12)^15 = ?

Let me compute step by step:

1.12^1 = 1.12

^2=1.2544

^3=1.4049

^4=1.5735

^5=1.7623

^6=1.9738

^7=2.2107

^8=2.4751

^9=2.7989

^10=3.1380

^11=3.5182

^12=3.9453

^13=4.4201

^14=4.9535

^15=5.5591 (Wait, perhaps my previous assumption was wrong. Maybe I should compute 1.12^15 accurately.)

Wait, perhaps I should use a
