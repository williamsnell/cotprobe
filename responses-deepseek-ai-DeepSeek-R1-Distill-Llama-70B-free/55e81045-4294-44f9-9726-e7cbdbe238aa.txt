Question:

After his 16th birthday, a youth decided to purchase a new sports car from a dealership for the sales price of $36,000. The youth thereafter entered into a written contract with the dealership, which provided that the youth would make monthly payments of $1,000 for three years. During the first year of the contract, the youth made 12 monthly payments totaling $12,000. However, the youth failed to make any payments during the second year of the contract. The dealership repeatedly threatened to sue the youth for the remaining balance that it claimed was due under the contract. Finally, in order to avoid litigation, the youth sent the dealership the following letter:"The car I purchased from you is a real lemon. I have spent a considerable sum of money during the last two years in repair work. I don't believe that the car is worth $36,000, but I am willing to pay you $10,000 if I find ajob in the next month. "The youth had just turned 18 when he sent this letter to the dealership. The day after mailing this letter, the youth was involved in an automobile accident, and the sports car was totally demolished. Following the accident, the youth remained unemployed, and he refused to make any payments to the dealership. At the time of the accident, the sports car was worth $18,000. In this jurisdiction, the age of majority is18 years of age. If the dealership brings suit against the youth for breach of contract, what, if any, is the plaintiff's proper recovery?

Options:

A: $36,000.00
B: $10,000. 00
C: $18,000. 00
D: The cost of repair work the youth has done on the car.
E: $30,000.00
F: Nothing.
G: $12,000.00
H: The cost of the car at the time of purchase minus the payments made so far.
I: $6,000.00

Okay, so I have this contract law question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me go through it step by step.

Alright, the scenario is about a youth who buys a sports car. He's just turned 16 when he enters into the contract, right? But wait, the age of majority in this jurisdiction is 18. So, that's important because it affects the enforceability of the contract.

He agreed to pay $1,000 a month for three years, which totals $36,000. In the first year, he made 12 payments, so that's $12,000. But in the second year, he didn't make any payments. The dealership is threatening to sue him for the remaining balance. Then, he sends them a letter offering $10,000 if he gets a job, but he ends up not paying anything else. Also, the car gets demolished in an accident when he's 18, and he remains unemployed.

So, the question is, can the dealership sue him successfully, and if so, how much can they recover?

First, I remember that contracts entered into by minors are generally voidable at the minor's discretion. So, when the youth was 16, he was a minor, and thus the contract could be voidable. Once he turns 18, the age of majority, he can choose to either affirm or disaffirm the contract.

In this case, after turning 18, he sent a letter offering to pay $10,000. Does that count as affirming the contract? Or maybe it's an attempt to negotiate a settlement, which might not necessarily be an affirmation.

Wait, but if he affirmed the contract after turning 18, then he'd be bound by it. Alternatively, if he disaffirmed it, the contract would be treated as if it never existed, and he might have to return the car or the dealership might have to return the payments made.

But here, the car was totally demolished. So, the car's value at the time of the accident was $18,000. So, if the contract is disaffirmed, the dealership might have a claim for the return of the car, but since it's destroyed, they might be entitled to the value of the car, which was $18k.

Wait, but before that, the youth had already made $12,000 in payments. So, perhaps the dealership is entitled to the value of the car minus the payments made, which would be $18k minus $12k, leaving $6k.

Alternatively, if the contract is still in force because he affirmed it, he would be liable for the remaining payments. The total contract was $36k, he paid $12k, so $24k left. But since the car was destroyed, maybe the dealership can't enforce the contract anymore because the subject of the contract is gone.

But I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me break it down.

1. **Capacity to Contract**: The youth was 16 when he entered the contract, so he was a minor. Contracts with minors are voidable, meaning the minor can choose to avoid the contract unless it's a necessaries contract, which a car isn't considered a necessity for a minor.

2. **Affirmation After Majority**: When he turned 18, he sent a letter offering $10k. Does this letter count as an affirmation? Or is it a counteroffer? If he's affirming, then he's bound by the original contract terms. If not, he might be disaffirming.

3. **Effect of Affirmation**: If he affirmed, then he's on the hook for the remaining payments. But since the car was destroyed, the dealership might have a claim for the value of the car, possibly under the doctrine of impossibility or frustration of purpose. Alternatively, they might argue that the youth breached the contract by not making payments, so they can recover the remaining balance.

But wait, in contract law, when a buyer breaches by non-payment, the seller can sue for the price or the difference if they resell. But here, the car is destroyed, not resold. So maybe the measure of damages is the value of the car at the time of destruction, minus any payments made.

Alternatively, the dealership might be able to revoke acceptance and sue for the contract price, but I think that's more in cases involving breaches of warranty.

Wait, but the youth had already made $12k in payments. So, if the contract is disaffirmed, the dealership would have to return those payments, but the youth would have to return the car. But the car is destroyed, so perhaps the dealership can only recover the value of the car minus the payments made.

Wait, but if the contract is disaffirmed, it's as if the contract never existed. So, the youth would have to return the car, and the dealership would have to refund the $12k. But since the car is destroyed, the youth can't return it, so the dealership might be entitled to the value of the car ($18k) from the youth. But the youth already paid $12k, so the dealership would be entitled to $18k minus $12k, which is $6k.

But in the options, I don't see $6k. Wait, option I is $6,000.00. So that would be the case if the contract is disaffirmed.

But wait, after the youth turned 18, he sent a letter offering $10k. Does that constitute an affirmation of the contract? If so, then the contract is no longer voidable, and he's bound by its terms. So, the dealership can sue for the remaining $24k.

But the car was destroyed after he turned 18. So, if the contract was affirmed, and the car is destroyed, does the dealership have a claim? Because the contract was for monthly payments, and the youth's failure to pay after the car was destroyed would be a breach.

Alternatively, if the contract is affirmed, the youth is liable for the remaining payments, regardless of the car's condition. So, the dealership could sue for the remaining $24k.

But I'm a bit confused about whether the letter he sent constitutes an affirmation. The letter says he's willing to pay $10k if he finds a job. That sounds more like a settlement offer rather than an affirmation of the entire contract. So, the dealership might not have accepted it, but in terms of contract law, any affirmation after majority would typically bind the contract.

Wait, but affirmation can be either express or implied. By sending the letter, he's acknowledging the contract and making a new offer, which might be seen as an attempt to modify the contract. But without the dealership's acceptance, it might not be a valid modification.

Alternatively, his offer to pay $10k could be seen as an accord, which would require consideration to be binding. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps his letter is not an affirmation but an attempt to settle the debt. So, the contract remains voidable, and he can choose to disaffirm it.

Wait, but in the question, the youth sent the letter after turning 18, so he's now of majority age. If he wants to disaffirm, he should do so within a reasonable time after reaching majority. If he doesn't, he might be considered to have affirmed the contract.

So, when he turned 18, he sent the letter. If his letter is considered an affirmation, then the contract stands.

But the letter says he's willing to pay $10k if he finds a job. That's a conditional offer, not an unequivocal affirmation. So, perhaps it's not enough to constitute affirmation.

If the contract is still voidable, and he disaffirms it, the dealership can recover the value of the car at the time of disaffirmance, minus the payments made.

Wait, but when he disaffirms, the contract is avoided, so the dealership can get the car back or its value. Since the car is destroyed, they can't get it back, so they can sue for its value.

The car was worth $18k at the time of the accident, which was after he turned 18. So, the dealership can recover $18k minus the $12k he already paid, which is $6k.

Looking at the options, option I is $6,000.00.

But wait, I'm not sure if the disaffirmance would allow the dealership to recover the full value, or if the payments made are subtracted.

Alternatively, if the contract is disaffirmed, the youth gets his $12k back, and the dealership gets the value of the car, which is $18k. So, the net would be $6k in favor of the dealership.

So, the answer would be I: $6,000.00.

But another angle: what if the contract is considered valid because he affirmed it? Then, the dealership can recover the remaining balance, which is $24k. But the car is destroyed, so perhaps they can't enforce the contract because the subject matter no longer exists. Or maybe the youth's failure to make payments after the car is destroyed is a breach, but the dealership can't really do anything about it since the car is gone.

Wait, but the contract was for paying $1k per month for three years. So, it's a payment plan, not tied to the condition of the car. So, even if the car is destroyed, the youth is still obligated to make payments if the contract is valid. So, if he affirmed the contract, the dealership could sue for the remaining $24k.

But in that case, the answer would be E: $30,000.00? Wait, no, because he already paid $12k, so the remaining would be $24k, which isn't one of the options except E is $30k, which is higher, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. The total is $36k. He paid $12k, so the remaining is $24k. But none of the options have $24k. So, maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the dealership can only recover the value of the car at the time of the accident, which is $18k, minus the payments made ($12k), resulting in $6k.

So, that would point to option I: $6,000.00.

But I'm a bit torn between whether the contract was affirmed or disaffirmed. If the letter he sent after turning 18 is considered an affirmation, then the contract stands, and he's liable for the remaining payments.

But the letter doesn't seem to affirm the entire contract; it's a conditional offer. So, perhaps it's not an affirmation. Therefore, the contract is disaffirmed, and the dealership can recover $18k minus $12k, which is $6k.

So, I think the correct answer is I: $6,000.00.
</think>

The youth entered into a contract to purchase a car for $36,000 when he was 16, which is below the age of majority (18). Contracts with minors are voidable, and upon reaching the age of majority, the youth could choose to affirm or disaffirm the contract. After turning 18, the youth sent a letter offering to pay $10,000 if he found a job, which does not constitute an unequivocal affirmation of the contract. Therefore, the contract remains voidable, and the youth can disaffirm it.

When a minor disaffirms a contract, the contract is treated as if it never existed. The dealership would be entitled to the return of the car or its value at the time of disaffirmance. Since the car was totally demolished in an accident, the dealership can recover its value at the time of the accident, which was $18,000. However, the youth had already made $12,000 in payments, so the dealership is only entitled to the difference, which is $6,000.

Thus, the proper recovery for the dealership is $6,000.00.
