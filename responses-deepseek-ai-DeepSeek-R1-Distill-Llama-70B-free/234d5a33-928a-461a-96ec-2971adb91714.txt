The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A man conveyed land by quitclaim deed as a gift to his cousin, who did not then record the deed or take possession of the land. Six months later, when the man was still in possession, he conveyed the land by quitclaim deed as a gift to a friend, who knew nothing of the deed to the cousin. The friend did not record his deed. The man then vacated the land, and the friend took possession. The recording act of the jurisdiction provides as follows: "No unrecorded conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value without notice, who shall first record." Recently, the cousin learned about the friend's deed and possession, immediately recorded her deed, and sued the friend for possession and to quiet title. The friend then recorded his deed and raised all available defenses. For whom is the court likely to decide?

Options:

A: For the friend, because the cousin did not take possession of the land.
B: For the friend, because the cousin did not record her deed in time.
C: For the cousin, because she has the original deed.
D: For the friend, because a subsequent good- faith donee has priority over a prior donee who fails to record.
E: For the cousin, because the friend failed to first record.
F: For the cousin, because the friend did not pay for the land.
G: For the cousin, because the man had already given the land away before giving it to the friend.
H: For the friend, because he was first in possession.
I: For the friend, because he was not aware of the previous deed.
J: For the cousin, because she was first in time and the friend was not a purchaser.

Okay, I've got this legal question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's try to break it down.

So, the situation is about property conveyance and recording acts. A man gave land to his cousin via a quitclaim deed as a gift. But the cousin didn't record it or take possession. Then, six months later, the same man gave the same land to his friend, also via quitclaim deed, and the friend didn't know about the cousin's deed. The friend didn't record his deed either. Later, the man left, the friend took possession. Now, the cousin found out about the friend's deed and possession, so she recorded her deed and sued the friend. The friend then recorded his deed and raised defenses. The question is, who will the court decide for?

First, I remember that recording acts determine the priority of property interests. There are different types of recording acts—notice, race, and race-notice. The key here is the jurisdiction's recording act, which says: "No unrecorded conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value without notice, who shall first record."

So, the cousin got her deed first but didn't record it. The friend got his deed later but also didn't record it immediately. But when the cousin found out, she recorded, and then the friend recorded his.

Wait, but the recording act here requires that to be protected, you have to be a subsequent purchaser for value without notice AND you have to record first. So, who is protected here?

The cousin's deed was unrecorded. The friend is a subsequent grantee. The friend didn't know about the cousin's deed, so he's without notice. But he's not a purchaser for value—he received it as a gift. So, the question is whether "purchaser for value" includes donees (people who receive gifts) or if it's limited to those who paid money.

I think in some jurisdictions, "purchase" can include taking by gift if the grantor paid, but I'm not sure. Wait, the term "purchaser for value" usually means someone who gave something of value, like money. So a donee, like the friend, doesn't qualify as a purchaser for value because they didn't pay anything. So, the friend wouldn't meet the "purchaser for value" part of the recording act.

So, the cousin didn't record her deed, but the friend isn't a purchaser for value. Therefore, the friend's claim wouldn't be protected under the recording act. Wait, but the cousin didn't record until after the friend took possession. But the friend wasn't a purchaser for value, so the recording act doesn't apply to him, meaning the cousin's earlier deed would still take priority.

Wait, but the cousin didn't record until after the friend had already taken possession. But since the friend isn't a purchaser for value, the cousin's prior unrecorded deed would still be valid against the friend. Because the friend doesn't meet the criteria to invoke the recording act's protection.

So, the court would likely decide for the cousin. Let me look at the options.

Option G says, "For the cousin, because the man had already given the land away before giving it to the friend." That makes sense because the cousin was the first in time, and the friend, not being a purchaser for value, can't take priority.

Option J says, "For the cousin, because she was first in time and the friend was not a purchaser." That sounds correct too. Because the friend wasn't a purchaser for value, so the recording act doesn't help him, and the cousin's earlier grant (even if unrecorded) would prevail.

Wait, but some recording acts might still protect a subsequent donee if they meet certain conditions. But I think the key here is that the act specifies "purchasers for value without notice." So, if the friend isn't a purchaser for value, he can't claim protection under the act. Thus, the cousin's prior deed, even unrecorded, would take priority because the friend doesn't qualify as a subsequent purchaser without notice who recorded first.

So, the answer would be either G or J. Let me think again. The recording act says that an unrecorded conveyance isn't good against a subsequent purchaser for value without notice who records first. But the friend didn't pay value, so he's not a purchaser. Therefore, the cousin's prior conveyance would still be valid against the friend.

Therefore, the court would likely decide for the cousin because she was first in time, and the friend doesn't meet the criteria to have priority. So, looking at the options, J says that: "For the cousin, because she was first in time and the friend was not a purchaser." That seems correct.

Wait, but another angle: when the friend took possession, the cousin's deed was unrecorded. Does possession affect the outcome? Generally, possession can put others on notice, but in this case, the friend didn't know about the cousin's deed and didn't have notice. But since the friend isn't a purchaser for value, the recording act doesn't apply, so the possession might not matter. Therefore, the cousin's deed, being first, would take priority.

So, the answer should be J.

The question revolves around the priority of property interests under a jurisdiction's recording act, which states: "No unrecorded conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value without notice, who shall first record." The key facts are as follows:

1. A man conveyed land to his cousin via a quitclaim deed as a gift, but the cousin did not record the deed or take possession.
2. Six months later, the same man conveyed the land to his friend, also via a quitclaim deed as a gift. The friend did not know about the cousin's deed, did not record his deed, but later took possession.
3. When the cousin learned of the friend's deed and possession, she recorded her deed and sued the friend. The friend then recorded his deed and raised defenses.

Under the recording act, protection is afforded to "subsequent purchasers for value without notice who shall first record." The friend, however, received the land as a gift and did not pay value, so he does not qualify as a "purchaser for value." Without meeting this requirement, the friend cannot invoke the protection of the recording act. As a result, the cousin's earlier, unrecorded deed takes priority because she was first in time, and the friend's lack of payment for the land means he cannot override her prior interest.

Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

**J: For the cousin, because she was first in time and the friend was not a purchaser.**

This option accurately reflects the legal principles at play, as the cousin's priority is established by being first in time, and the friend's status as a donee (not a purchaser for value) prevents him from claiming priority under the recording act.

Answer: J
