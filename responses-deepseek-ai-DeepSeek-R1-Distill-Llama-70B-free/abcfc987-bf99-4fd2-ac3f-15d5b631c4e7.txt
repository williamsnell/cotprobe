Okay, so I have this question about baseball, and I'm trying to figure out the answer. The question is asking how many balls make a walk. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with all the baseball rules, but I remember that a walk is when a batter gets to first base without hitting the ball, right? So they just walk there.

I think it has to do with the number of balls thrown outside the strike zone. So, a batter gets a certain number of balls, and if they reach that number, they get a walk. I remember hearing something about four balls. Like, four balls and you walk. But wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing it up with strikes. Because I know that three strikes mean you're out, so maybe four balls mean a walk. That makes sense because three strikes are an out, so four balls would be the opposite, leading to a walk.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes the count can go higher. Like, sometimes I see the count go to 3-2, which means three balls and two strikes. So if the next pitch is a ball, that would make four balls total, and the batter walks. So yeah, four balls equal a walk.

Let me think about the options given. The options are A through J, with numbers 1 to 10. Let's see, option C is four. That must be the correct answer. So the answer should be C.

I don't think it's three because that would be too few. I remember seeing batters walk on four balls, not three. Also, five seems too high because the count doesn't usually go that far without a strikeout or a hit. So yeah, four balls make a walk.
