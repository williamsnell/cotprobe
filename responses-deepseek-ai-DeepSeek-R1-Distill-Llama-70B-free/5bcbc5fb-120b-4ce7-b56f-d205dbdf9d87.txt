Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about different types of malware. The question is asking about a program that steals logins and passwords specifically for instant messaging applications. Let me think about each option to figure out the correct answer.

The options are A through J, each representing a different type of malicious software. I'll go through them one by one.

Option A is Banking Trojan. I remember that Banking Trojans are designed to steal online banking credentials. They might target your bank's website or financial information, so this probably isn't the right answer because the question is about IM applications, not banking.

Option B is Rootkit Trojan. Rootkits are more about hiding malware or giving unauthorized access. They can hide files or processes, but I don't think they specifically target IM login credentials. So maybe not B.

Option C is Worm-Downloader. Worms are malware that spread from system to system without needing user interaction. A Downloader might just download more malware, but I'm not sure if it's specific to IM logins. Not sure yet.

Option D is Keylogging Malware. Keyloggers record keystrokes, so they can capture any information you type, including passwords. But the question specifically mentions IM applications. Keyloggers are more general, right? They might capture IM logins, but maybe there's a more specific term.

Option E is Backdoor Trojans. Backdoors provide remote access to a system, allowing attackers to control it. They might be used for various purposes, but again, not specifically targeting IM credentials.

Option F is Email Spyware. This sounds like it's focused on monitoring email, maybe stealing email passwords or reading emails. Not IM, so probably not F.

Option G is Trojan-Downloader. Similar to option C, these download other Trojans or malware. Not specifically targeting IM logins, I think.

Option H is IM – Trojans. Hmm, this seems directly related to IM applications. The name suggests it's a Trojan that affects IM, so this could be the one. It's designed to steal IM logins and passwords.

Option I is Ransom Trojan. Ransomware encrypts files and demands payment. Not related to stealing logins, so I can eliminate this.

Option J is Infostealer Trojan. InfoStealers are designed to steal information, including logins and passwords, but they might target various applications, not just IM. So maybe, but the question is specifically about IM, so perhaps option H is more precise.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused between H and J. Option H is called IM – Trojans, which clearly points to instant messaging. So that's more specific. J is more general, stealing info from various sources, but H is tailored for IM.

So the answer should be H: IM – Trojans.

The correct answer is the program specifically designed to target instant messaging applications to steal logins and passwords.
