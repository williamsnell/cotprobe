Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me think through it carefully.

The question is about pea plants and their traits. I remember that in Mendelian genetics, traits are determined by genes, and each gene has different alleles. The problem mentions two traits: height and cotyledon color.

So, the first part says that tall (D) is dominant to dwarf (d). That makes sense because usually, uppercase letters are dominant. Then, yellow cotyledons (G) is dominant to green (g). So for each trait, we have a dominant and recessive allele.

The parents in the cross are a tall, homozygous, yellow pea plant and a dwarf, green pea plant. Wait, okay, let me parse that. The tall plant is homozygous. Since tall is dominant, that means its genotype for height must be DD because homozygous and tall. Because if it were Dd, it would be heterozygous. So the tall parent is DD.

For the cotyledon color, the tall plant is yellow, which is dominant (G). Since it's homozygous, I think that means it's GG for that trait. Because homozygous could mean either homozygous dominant or recessive, but since yellow is dominant and the plant is yellow, it must be GG.

So the tall, yellow parent has the genotypes DD GG. Because each trait is considered separately.

Now, the other parent is a dwarf, green plant. Dwarf is recessive, so its genotype for height must be dd. Green is recessive, so the cotyledon color genotype is gg. So the dwarf, green parent is dd gg.

Now, the cross is between these two. Let me write their genotypes:

Parent 1: DD GG (tall, yellow)
Parent 2: dd gg (dwarf, green)

Wait, but wait. The question says the tall plant is homozygous. Oh, wait, the question says it's tall, homozygous, yellow. So maybe the homozygous refers to both traits? Hmm, no, I think the wording is that the plant is tall, and for each trait, it's homozygous. Or perhaps homozygous for each trait. Because the problem doesn't specify, but in the question, the plant is described as tall (so D), homozygous, and yellow (G). So I think the plant is homozygous for both genes. So genotype would be DD GG.

So when they cross, each parent contributes one allele for each gene.

Let me think about the F1 generation first.

Parent 1: DD GG → gametes: D G (since homozygous, so all gametes will have D and G)
Parent 2: dd gg → gametes: d g

So all the F1 plants will receive D from the tall parent and d from the dwarf parent. So their genotype for height is Dd. Similarly, for cotyledon color, they get G from the tall parent and g from the green, so Gg.

So F1 genotypes are Dd Gg.

Now, what's the phenotype? For height, D is dominant, so Dd is tall. For color, G is dominant, so Gg is yellow.

So the F1 plants are all tall and yellow. Wait, but looking at the options, let's check. Hmm, wait no, wait the parents are the tall, yellow (DD GG) and dwarf, green (dd gg). So the cross is between these two, and F1 is Dd Gg. So phenotypically, they are tall (D_ ) and yellow (G_ ), which is tall and yellow.

Wait, but I thought the options would have different F1. Let me look at the options again.

Looking at the options, option E says F1 are all tall and yellow. Option I says F1 are all tall and yellow. Option H has F1 as dwarf and yellow, which doesn't fit. Option E's F1 is tall and yellow.

Wait, the F1 would be Dd Gg, which is tall and yellow. So looking at the options, which ones have F1 as tall and yellow?

Looking through the options:

Option E: F1 all tall and yellow. So possible.

Option I: F1 all tall and yellow.

Others either have F1 as tall and green or dwarf and something.

So now, the next step is F2. How to get F2.

Well, to get F2, we need to self the F1 plants. So F1 plants are Dd Gg. When selfed, each will produce gametes for each gene.

For the Dd gene, the gametes are D and d, each with 50% chance. Similarly, for Gg, gametes are G and g.

So when selfing, the F2 generation will result from the combination of these gametes.

But wait, the two genes are probably independent, so we can consider their segregation separately.

Each gene will follow a 3:1 ratio in F2 if selfing, but since they are two genes, the total phenotypic ratio will be 9:3:3:1.

Wait, wait, no. Because each F1 plant is Dd Gg. So when they self, each gene will segregate. The F2 will have the following combinations:

For the D gene (height):
- DD (25%)
- Dd (50%)
- dd (25%)

For the G gene (color):
- GG (25%)
- Gg (50%)
- gg (25%)

But because the genes are independent, we'll have to consider the combinations. So the phenotypic ratios will be based on each gene's expression.

So for each gene:

Height:
- DD → tall
- Dd → tall
- dd → dwarf

Color:
- GG → yellow
- Gg → yellow
- gg → green

So the F2 phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities.

The possible phenotypic combinations are:

Tall and yellow → (3/4 tall) * (3/4 yellow) = 9/16
Tall and green → (3/4 tall) * (1/4 green) = 3/16
Dwarf and yellow → (1/4 dwarf) * (3/4 yellow) = 3/16
Dwarf and green → (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16

So the F2 generation will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but in terms of the actual counts, it's 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, 1/16.

Wait, but I have to look at the options again. Let me see the options.

Looking back, let's see which option matches F1 being all tall yellow, and F2 having 9/16 tall yellow, 3/16 tall green, 3/16 dwarf yellow, 1/16 dwarf green.

Looking at the options:

Option I: F1 all tall and yellow. F2 has 9/16 tall and yellow, 3/16 tall and green, 3/16 dwarf and yellow, 1/16 dwarf and green. Yes, that's the ratio I just calculated.

Option E: F1 all tall and yellow. F2 has 3/4 tall yellow, 1/4 dwarf green. That doesn't match because F2 should have four phenotypes, not two.

So option I is looking correct.

Wait, but let me double-check the parents' genotypes.

Wait, the tall, homozygous, yellow parent is DD GG. The other is dwarf, green: dd gg. So F1 is Dd Gg, as I thought.

Wait, but another point: when you cross two plants, one being homozygous and the other homozygous recessive, the F1 would be heterozygous for both genes. So yes, Dd Gg.

So F1 is tall (dominant D) and yellow (dominant G). So F1 is tall and yellow.

So in the options, only options E and I have F1 as tall and yellow. Now, looking at their F2.

Option E: F2 has 3/4 tall yellow, 1/4 dwarf green. That's only two phenotypes, which doesn't happen because each gene has segregation. So that's incorrect.

Option I: F2 has all four phenotypes in 9:3:3:1 ratio. So that makes sense.

Wait, but let me look again. Option I says F2 has 9/16 tall yellow, 3/16 tall green, 3/16 dwarf yellow, 1/16 dwarf green. Which matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio.

Another option to check is option B. Wait, option B has F1 as tall and green. So that can't be right because F1 is Dd Gg, so Gg is yellow. So option B's F1 is wrong.

So the correct answer must be option I.

The question involves a genetic cross in peas, where tall (D) is dominant to dwarf (d), and yellow cotyledons (G) are dominant to green (g). The cross is between a tall, homozygous, yellow pea plant (genotype: **DD GG**) and a dwarf, green pea plant (genotype: **dd gg**). The goal is to determine the phenotypic results in the F₁ and F₂ generations.

### Analysis:

1. **F₁ Generation**:
   - The tall, homozygous, yellow parent (**DD GG**) can only produce gametes with **D** and **G**.
   - The dwarf, green parent (**dd gg**) can only produce gametes with **d** and **g**.
   - All F₁ offspring will inherit **Dd Gg**.
   - Phenotypically, **Dd** results in tall (since **D** is dominant) and **Gg** results in yellow (since **G** is dominant). Thus, the F₁ generation is **all tall and yellow**.

2. **F₂ Generation**:
   - The F₁ plants (**Dd Gg**) are selfed. Each gene segregates independently.
   - For the height gene (**D/d**):
     - **DD** (25%), **Dd** (50%), **dd** (25%).
     - Phenotypes: **tall** (DD, Dd) and **dwarf** (dd).
   - For the cotyledon color gene (**G/g**):
     - **GG** (25%), **Gg** (50%), **gg** (25%).
     - Phenotypes: **yellow** (GG, Gg) and **green** (gg).
   - Combining the probabilities for the two genes, the F₂ generation exhibits a **9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio**:
     - **9/16 tall and yellow**,
     - **3/16 tall and green**,
     - **3/16 dwarf and yellow**,
     - **1/16 dwarf and green**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. F₁ is not all tall and green; F₁ is all tall and yellow.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. F₁ is not all tall and green; F₁ is all tall and yellow.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. F₁ is not all dwarf and green; F₁ is all tall and yellow.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. F₁ is not all tall and green; F₁ is all tall and yellow.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. F₂ does not have only two phenotypes (3/4 tall yellow, 1/4 dwarf green); F₂ has four phenotypes in a 9:3:3:1 ratio.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. F₁ is not all dwarf and yellow; F₁ is all tall and yellow.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. F₂ does not have a 1:2:1 ratio; F₂ has a 9:3:3:1 ratio.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. F₁ is not all dwarf and yellow; F₁ is all tall and yellow.
- **Option I**: Correct. F₁ is all tall and yellow, and F₂ has the correct 9:3:3:1 ratio (9/16 tall and yellow, 3/16 tall and green, 3/16 dwarf and yellow, 1/16 dwarf and green).
- **Option J**: Incorrect. F₁ is not all dwarf and green; F₁ is all tall and yellow.

### Final Answer:
**I**
