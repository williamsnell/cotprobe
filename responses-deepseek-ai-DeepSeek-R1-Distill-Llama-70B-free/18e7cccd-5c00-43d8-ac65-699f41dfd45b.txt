Okay, so I've got this problem about Mrs. Smith and her savings account. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I remember that compound interest calculations can be a bit tricky, but I'll take it slow.

Alright, the question says she deposited $200 at an interest rate of 5%, compounded semiannually. She leaves it for 5 years, and I need to find out how much she'll have in total and how much interest she earned. The options are from A to J, so I'll calculate and see which one matches.

First, I think about the formula for compound interest. I remember it's A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt). Where:
- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- P is the principal amount, which is the initial amount of money. Here, that's $200.
- r is the annual interest rate (decimal). So 5% would be 0.05.
- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year. Since it's semiannual, that's 2 times a year.
- t is the time the money is invested for in years. She left it for 5 years.

So plugging in the numbers:
P = 200
r = 0.05
n = 2
t =5

Let me calculate the exponent part first. So nt is 2*5=10. Then, (1 + r/n) is (1 + 0.05/2). Wait, 0.05 divided by 2 is 0.025. So 1.025. So the formula becomes A = 200*(1.025)^10.

Hmm, I need to compute 1.025 to the power of 10. I don't have a calculator, but maybe I can figure it out step by step. Alternatively, I can remember that (1.025)^10 is approximately 1.2800845... Wait, let me think. Another approach is to compute it year by year.

Wait, semiannual means every half year, so each compounding period is 6 months. So each time, the amount increases by 2.5% (since 5% annually divided by 2).

Let me compute each compounding step. Starting with $200.

After 1st period (6 months): 200 * 1.025 = 205.
After 2nd period (1 year): 205 * 1.025. Let me calculate that. 205 * 1.025. 205 * 1 is 205, 205 *0.025 is 5.125. So total 210.125.

Wait, this might get tedious for 10 periods, but maybe there's a pattern or a faster way. Alternatively, using the formula, A=200*(1.025)^10.

Wait, I remember that (1 + 0.025)^10 can be calculated using the rule of 72 or logarithms, but that's probably not the quickest way here. Alternatively, maybe I can use logarithms or exponentials, but perhaps I can just compute it step by step.

Alternatively, I can recall that (1.025)^10 is approximately 1.2800845. So 200 * 1.2800845 equals around 256.0169, which is approximately $256.02. So the total amount would be about $256.02, and the interest earned is that minus the principal, which is $56.02.

Looking back at the options, option E is $256.02 and $56.02. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculation of (1.025)^10. Maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Another approach: using the formula for exponents. Or perhaps I can compute it as e^(10 * ln(1.025)).

But maybe a better way is to compute (1.025)^10 step by step.

Compute (1.025)^2: 1.025 * 1.025 = 1.050625.

Then, (1.050625)^5 because (1.025)^10 is the same as ((1.025)^2)^5.

So (1.050625)^5. Let's compute that:

First, compute (1.050625)^2: 1.050625 * 1.050625.

Let me compute that. 1.05 * 1.05 is 1.1025, but since it's 1.050625, the exact value would be a bit higher.

1.050625 * 1.050625:

Calculate 1 * 1.050625 = 1.050625
0.05 * 1.050625 = 0.05253125
0.000625 * 1.050625 = approximately 0.000656640625

Adding those together: 1.050625 + 0.05253125 = 1.10315625 + 0.000656640625 ≈ 1.1038128906.

So (1.050625)^2 ≈ 1.1038128906.

Now, we can compute (1.1038128906)^2 to get to the 4th power, and then multiply by 1.1038128906 to get to the 5th power.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that (1.025)^10 is approximately 1.2800845.

So 200 * 1.2800845 = 256.0169, which is $256.02, and interest is 256.02 -200 =56.02.

So the correct option is E: $256.02 and $56.02.

To calculate the future value of Mrs. Smith's savings account, we use the compound interest formula:

\[
A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}
\]

Where:
- \( P = 200 \) (principal amount),
- \( r = 0.05 \) (annual interest rate),
- \( n = 2 \) (compounded semiannually),
- \( t = 5 \) (time in years).

Substituting the values:

\[
A = 200 \left(1 + \frac{0.05}{2}\right)^{2 \cdot 5}
\]

Simplify:

\[
A = 200 \left(1.025\right)^{10}
\]

Using approximations or a calculator, \((1.025)^{10} \approx 1.2800845\). Thus:

\[
A \approx 200 \cdot 1.2800845 = 256.02
\]

The total amount after 5 years is approximately **$256.02**. The interest earned is:

\[
\text{Interest} = A - P = 256.02 - 200 = 56.02
\]

Thus, the total amount is **$256.02**, and the interest earned is **$56.02**. Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:

**E: $256.02 and $56.02**
