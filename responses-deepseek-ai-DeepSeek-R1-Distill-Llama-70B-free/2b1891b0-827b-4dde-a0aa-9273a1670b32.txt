Okay, so I have this question about contract law, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The question says that Tom and Jerry entered into a contract where Tom agreed to sell Jerry $1,000 worth of heroin, which is an illegal substance. The question is asking what type of contract this is, with options from A to J.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on contract types, but I remember that certain contracts are unenforceable because they involve illegal activities. Let me think about each option.

Option A is quasi-contract. I think quasi-contracts, or quasi contracts, are when the law imposes a contractual obligation even when there's no actual agreement. Like for unjust enrichment. But this situation is an actual agreement, so maybe not A.

Option B is unilateral contract. That's where one party makes a promise, and the other party's acceptance is performance, like a reward poster. Here, they're both agreeing, so probably not B.

Option C is secondary party beneficiary. That's when a third party benefits from a contract between two others. Doesn't seem to apply here.

Option D is express contract. That's when the terms are explicitly stated, either written or oral. I think this contract was expressed, but the issue is the legality of the subject matter.

Option E is bilateral contract. That's where both parties make promises. Tom promises to sell, Jerry to buy. So this is a bilateral contract, but again, the legality is the main issue.

Option F is implied contract. That's based on actions rather than explicit promises. Not the case here since they have an express agreement.

Option G is void contract. A void contract is unenforceable from the start, usually because it's against public policy or involves illegal activities. Heroin is illegal, so this contract would be void.

Option H is voidable contract. That's where one party can choose to avoid it, like in cases of fraud or minority. Not sure if that applies here; the illegality makes it void, not just voidable.

Option I is unconscionable contract. That's where the terms are so unfair it's shocking. Maybe, but the main issue is the illegality, not just unfairness.

Option J is contract of adhesion. That's a standard form contract where the weaker party has no real negotiation power. Not relevant here.

So putting it together, the contract involves selling illegal drugs. Contracts for illegal purposes are void because they're against public policy. So the correct answer should be G: void contract.

The contract between Tom and Jerry involves the sale of heroin, an illegal substance. Contracts involving illegal activities are unenforceable from the start because they violate public policy. This makes the contract void. 

Answer: G
