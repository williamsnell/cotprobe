Okay, so I need to figure out how much the paint will cost for this room. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking. The room has walls and a ceiling that I need to paint. The dimensions given are 14 feet by 12 feet, and the height is 8 and a half feet. Oh wait, the last part of the dimension is written as 8(1/2)' — I think that's 8.5 feet, right?

So first, I should calculate the total area I need to paint. The room has four walls and one ceiling. Wait, no, wait. Actually, when you paint a room, you paint the ceiling and the four walls. But the floor isn't being painted here. So I need to find the area of the ceiling and the areas of the four walls.

The ceiling is a rectangle, so its area is length times width. The length is 14 feet and the width is 12 feet. So 14 * 12 = 168 square feet for the ceiling.

Now the walls: there are two walls of each dimension. So two walls are 14 feet long and 8.5 feet high, and the other two are 12 feet long and 8.5 feet high.

Calculating each pair:

For the 14-foot walls: each has an area of 14 * 8.5. Let me compute that. 14 * 8 is 112, and 14 * 0.5 is 7, so total 119 square feet per wall. Since there are two of these, 119 * 2 = 238 square feet.

For the 12-foot walls: each is 12 * 8.5. 12 * 8 is 96, and 12 * 0.5 is 6, so 102 per wall. Two of them would be 204 square feet.

Adding all the areas together: ceiling (168) + 14-foot walls (238) + 12-foot walls (204). Let's add those up. 168 + 238 is 406, plus 204 gives 610 square feet total.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait a second. Did I make a mistake there? Let me check the calculations again.

Ceiling: 14 *12=168. Correct.

14-foot walls: 14 *8.5 = 119 each, times 2 = 238. Correct.

12-foot walls: 12 *8.5 = 102 each, times 2 =204. Correct.

Total area: 168 + 238 is 406, plus 204 equals 610. Hmm, yeah that's right.

Now, I need to figure out how much paint I need. The paint costs $6.50 per gallon, and one gallon covers 425 square feet. Or alternatively, it's $1.85 per quart, which I suppose is a quarter of a gallon. Wait, but wait—quart is a quarter of a gallon, right? So a quart covers 425 /4 = 106.25 sq.ft. Because one gallon covers 425, so a quart (1/4 gallon) covers 1/4 of that area.

Alternatively, maybe I should just stick with gallons because the larger quantity might be cheaper or easier to calculate.

So the total area is 610 sq.ft. Each gallon covers 425. How many gallons do I need? Let's divide 610 by 425.

610 ÷ 425 = approx 1.435. So that's about 1.435 gallons. But you can't buy a fraction of a gallon, so you have to round up to the next whole number, which is 2 gallons.

Wait, but wait. Wait, 1 gallon covers 425. So 610 is more than 425, so you need two gallons. But wait, 2 gallons would cover 850 sq.ft, which is more than enough. So yes, 2 gallons.

Now, the cost. Each gallon is $6.50, so two gallons would be 2 *6.50= $13.00.

Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I can buy in quarts to get closer to the needed amount. Let's see.

Each quart covers 106.25 sq.ft. So 610 ÷ 106.25 = approx 5.745 quarts. That's about 5.745 quarts, so I would need 6 quarts. Because you can't buy a fraction of a quart, so you round up.

But wait, each quart is $1.85, so 6 quarts would be 6 *1.85 = $11.10. Hmm, that's cheaper than buying two gallons, which is $13.00. So maybe that's a better option.

Wait, but quarts might be more expensive per gallon than buying gallons. Let me see. 

Wait, a gallon is 4 quarts. So each quart costs $1.85, so a gallon (4 quarts) would be 4 *1.85 = $7.40 per gallon. But wait, the gallon price is $6.50, which is cheaper than $7.40. So buying in gallons is cheaper.

So the better deal is to buy gallons. So I need two gallons, which cost 2 *6.50= $13.00.

Wait, but wait another thing. Maybe I can buy 1 gallon and some quarts. Let me see.

1 gallon covers 425. So after using one gallon, I have 610-425=185 sq.ft left.

Each quart covers 106.25, so 185 ÷106.25 = approx 1.742. So I need 2 quarts. So total would be 1 gallon + 2 quarts.

Cost would be 6.50 + (2 *1.85) =6.50 +3.70= $10.20. Oh wait, that's cheaper than two gallons. Because 2 gallons cost 13.00, whereas 1 gallon plus two quarts is 10.20. Hmm, so that's a better deal.

Wait, but why did I not think of that before. So let me re-calculate.

Total area: 610.

Option 1: Buy 2 gallons → 2 *6.50=13.00.

Option 2: Buy 1 gallon and 2 quarts → 6.50 + (2 *1.85)=6.50 +3.70=10.20.

Option 3: Buy 6 quarts →6*1.85=11.10.

So option 2 is the cheapest. So the cost is $10.20.

Wait, but am I allowed to buy fractions of quarts? Because 2 quarts would cover 212.5 sq.ft, but I only need 185. So 2 quarts would be enough, but 1 quart would only cover 106.25, which isn't enough. So yes, I need 2 quarts. So 1 gallon plus 2 quarts is sufficient.

So the cost is $10.20, which is option B.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are:

A: $7.65

B: $10.20

C: $15.30

D: $26.00

E: $9.75

F: $2.80

G: $13.00

H: $19.50

I: $3.70

J: $6.50

So option B is $10.20, which seems to be the correct answer.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the surface area. Let me recalculate the areas.

Ceiling: 14 *12 = 168. Correct.

Walls: There are two walls of 14' x8.5' and two of 12'x8.5'.

14*8.5=119 each wall. Two walls: 238.

12*8.5=102 each. Two walls:204.

Total walls: 238 +204=442.

Adding ceiling: 442 +168=610. Correct.

So yes, 610 sq.ft.

Now, each gallon covers 425. So 1 gallon covers 425, leaving 610-425=185.

Each quart covers 425/4=106.25. So 185/106.25≈1.742. So 2 quarts needed.

So 1 gallon and 2 quarts.

Cost: 6.50 + (2 *1.85)=6.50 +3.70=10.20.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer is B.

To determine the cost of the paint, we first calculate the total area to be painted. The room has a ceiling and four walls. The ceiling is a rectangle with dimensions 14' × 12', giving an area of:

\[
14 \times 12 = 168 \, \text{sq.ft.}
\]

For the walls, there are two walls of 14' × 8.5' and two walls of 12' × 8.5'. The area of the 14' walls is:

\[
2 \times (14 \times 8.5) = 2 \times 119 = 238 \, \text{sq.ft.}
\]

The area of the 12' walls is:

\[
2 \times (12 \times 8.5) = 2 \times 102 = 204 \, \text{sq.ft.}
\]

Adding these together, the total area to be painted is:

\[
168 + 238 + 204 = 610 \, \text{sq.ft.}
\]

Next, we calculate the amount of paint needed. One gallon of paint covers 425 sq.ft., and one quart covers:

\[
\frac{425}{4} = 106.25 \, \text{sq.ft.}
\]

To cover 610 sq.ft., we consider the following options:

1. **Buying gallons only**:  
   Since 1 gallon covers 425 sq.ft., we need:

   \[
   \frac{610}{425} \approx 1.435 \, \text{gallons.}
   \]

   Rounding up, we need 2 gallons. The cost is:

   \[
   2 \times 6.50 = 13.00 \, \text{dollars.}
   \]

2. **Buying quarts only**:  
   Since 1 quart covers 106.25 sq.ft., we need:

   \[
   \frac{610}{106.25} \approx 5.745 \, \text{quarts.}
   \]

   Rounding up, we need 6 quarts. The cost is:

   \[
   6 \times 1.85 = 11.10 \, \text{dollars.}
   \]

3. **Combining gallons and quarts**:  
   Using 1 gallon (425 sq.ft.) leaves:

   \[
   610 - 425 = 185 \, \text{sq.ft.}
   \]

   To cover 185 sq.ft., we need:

   \[
   \frac{185}{106.25} \approx 1.742 \, \text{quarts.}
   \]

   Rounding up, we need 2 quarts. The total cost is:

   \[
   1 \times 6.50 + 2 \times 1.85 = 6.50 + 3.70 = 10.20 \, \text{dollars.}
   \]

The cheapest option is buying 1 gallon and 2 quarts, costing **$10.20**. Comparing this to the given options:

- **A: $7.65** — Too low.
- **B: $10.20** — Correct.
- **C: $15.30** — Too high.
- **D: $26.00** — Too high.
- **E: $9.75** — Too low.
- **F: $2.80** — Too low.
- **G: $13.00** — Higher than $10.20.
- **H: $19.50** — Too high.
- **I: $3.70** — Too low.
- **J: $6.50** — Too low.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**B: $10.20**

Answer: B
