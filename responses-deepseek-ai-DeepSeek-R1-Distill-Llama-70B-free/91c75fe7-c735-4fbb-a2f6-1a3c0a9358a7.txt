Okay, so I've got this question about Derek Parfit and his views on obligations towards our children's welfare. Hmm, I remember that Parfit discusses a lot about ethics and personal identity. The question is asking whether the obligation to prioritize our children's welfare is agent-relative or agent-neutral, or maybe something else.

Wait, agent-relative versus agent-neutral. Agent-relative obligations are those that depend on the agent's personal relationships or roles. Like, a parent's duty to their child is agent-relative because it's based on their specific relationship. On the other hand, agent-neutral would mean the obligation is more universal, like a general moral rule that applies to everyone regardless of personal connections.

Parfit, if I recall correctly, talks about different theories of ethics. He might have discussed how some obligations are relative to the agent. For example, a parent has a special duty to their own child that others don't have in the same way. So, the obligation isn't just about the child's welfare in a universal sense but is rooted in the parent's unique relationship to them.

So, in that case, the obligation would be agent-relative. That would make option A the answer. But wait, are there any nuances I'm missing? I think Parfit does argue against some forms of agent-relative views, but in the context of family and children, he might still support the idea that these obligations are agent-relative.

Alternatively, maybe he considers them to be agent-neutral because the welfare is important regardless of who you are. But no, that doesn't seem right because the parent's responsibility is specific to their own children, not everyone else's. So, it's more about the agent's particular role.

I think I'm confident that the answer is A: agent-relative.

The obligation to prioritize the welfare of one’s children, according to Parfit, is agent-relative. This means the duty arises from the specific relationship between the parent and child, making option A the correct answer.

Answer: A
