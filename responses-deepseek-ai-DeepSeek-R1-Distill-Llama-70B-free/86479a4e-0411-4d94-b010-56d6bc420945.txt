Okay, so I have this problem about a savings account earning interest in two different periods. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the account starts with $2000. It earns 4% interest, compounded quarterly for 3 years. Then, it earns 5% interest, compounded semiannually for the next two years. I need to find the final balance and the total interest earned.

I remember that compound interest can be calculated using the formula A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:
- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).
- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- t is the time the money is invested for in years.

So let's tackle the first part: 4% interest, compounded quarterly for 3 years.

Wait, the interest rate is 4%, which as a decimal is 0.04. Since it's compounded quarterly, that means four times a year. So n is 4.

The time t is 3 years. Plugging into the formula:

A1 = 2000 * (1 + 0.04/4)^(4*3)

Let me compute that. Let's see, 0.04 divided by 4 is 0.01. And 4 times 3 is 12. So it's (1.01)^12.

I think (1.01)^12 is approximately 1.126825... Let me double-check that. Oh wait, I can compute it more accurately. Alternatively, using a calculator would help, but since I'm doing this mentally, maybe I can recall that (1.01)^12 is about 1.12682503. So A1 would be 2000 * 1.12682503 = approx 2000 * 1.126825 = let's see, 2000 * 1.12 is 2240, 2000 * 0.006825 is 13.65, so total around 2253.65? Hmm, wait, 0.126825 is 12.6825%, so 2000 * 1.126825 = 2253.65. Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 1.01^12: Let me compute step by step.

1.01^1 = 1.01
1.01^2 = 1.0201
1.01^3 ≈ 1.030301
1.01^4 ≈ 1.040604
1.01^5 ≈ 1.051010
1.01^6 ≈ 1.061520
1.01^7 ≈ 1.072135
1.01^8 ≈ 1.082857
1.01^9 ≈ 1.093685
1.01^10≈ 1.104622
1.01^11≈ 1.115668
1.01^12≈1.126825

So that's correct. So A1 is 2000 * 1.12682503 = 2000 * (approx) 1.126825 = let's compute this: 2000 * 1 = 2000, 2000 * 0.126825 = 253.65. So A1 is 2253.65.

Wait, but wait, no, I think I made a mistake. Because 0.04/4 is 0.01, and the formula is correct.

Wait, 2000 * (1.01)^12 = 2000 * 1.12682503 = 2253.65.

So after 3 years, the amount is $2253.65.

Now, the second part is 5% interest, compounded semiannually for 2 years. So the new principal is $2253.65. The rate is 5%, so 0.05. Compounded semiannually, so n is 2. Time t is 2 years.

So the formula becomes A2 = 2253.65 * (1 + 0.05/2)^(2*2)

0.05/2 is 0.025, and 2*2 is 4. So (1.025)^4.

What's (1.025)^4? Let's compute that.

1.025^1 = 1.025
1.025^2 = 1.025 * 1.025 = 1.050625
1.025^3 = 1.050625 * 1.025 ≈ 1.077031
1.025^4 ≈ 1.077031 * 1.025 ≈ let's compute that.

1.077031 * 1.025:

Multiply 1.077031 by 1.025.

1.077031 * 1 = 1.077031
1.077031 * 0.025 = 0.026925775
Adding them gives 1.103956775. So approximately 1.103957.

So A2 = 2253.65 * 1.103957.

Let me compute that. 2253.65 * 1.103957.

Hmm, let's break it down:

2253.65 * 1 = 2253.65

2253.65 * 0.1 = 225.365

2253.65 * 0.003957 = let's compute that.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me compute 2253.65 * 1.103957.

Alternatively, using approximate calculation: 2253.65 * 1.10 is 2253.65 + 225.365 = 2478. 0. Then the remaining 0.003957 is 2253.65 * 0.003957.

Wait, but perhaps I should just compute it more accurately.

2253.65 * 1.103957.

Let me compute 2253.65 * 1.1 = 2253.65 + 225.365 = 2478.015.

Then 2253.65 * 0.003957.

Compute 2253.65 * 0.003 = 6.76095.

2253.65 * 0.000957 = approximately 2253.65 * 0.001 is 2.25365, so 0.000957 is about 2.25365 * 0.957 ≈ 2.157.

Wait, perhaps a better way: 0.003957 is approximately 0.004 - 0.000043.

So 2253.65 * 0.004 = approx 9.0146. Then subtract 2253.65 * 0.000043.

2253.65 * 0.000043 = 0.0968 approximately. So 9.0146 - 0.0968 ≈ 8.9178.

So 2253.65 * 0.003957 ≈ 8.9178.

So adding to the 2478.015 from 1.1 gives 2478.015 + 8.9178 = 2486.9328.

So A2 is approximately $2486.93. Let's say $2486.93.

Wait, but let me double-check this calculation because I might have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps using a table factor approach, but I think the approximate is around $2486. Maybe more accurately, let's compute 2253.65 * 1.103957.

Another approach: 2253.65 * 1.103957.

Compute 2253.65 * 1.103957:

2253.65 * 1 = 2253.65
2253.65 * 0.1 = 225.365
2253.65 * 0.003957 ≈ 8.92 (as before)
So total is 2253.65 + 225.365 = 2478. + 8.92 = 2486.92.

So the final amount is approximately $2486.93.

Now, the question is what's the final balance and the interest earned.

The initial principal was $2000, and the final amount is $2486.93. So the interest earned is 2486.93 - 2000 = $486.93.

Looking at the options:

Option D is $2503.76 and $503.76. Hmm, but my approximate is about $2486.93, which is not matching exactly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me redo the second part more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should use more accurate factors. Let me get the exact value of (1.01)^12 and (1.025)^4.

Wait, let me compute (1.01)^12 accurately. Using a calculator would help, but since I can't, perhaps I can use the exact value.

(1.01)^12 is 1.12682499996, approximately 1.126825.

So A1 is 2000 * 1.126825 = 2000 * 1.126825 = 2253.65.

Then, for the second part, using 5% semiannually, so n=2, t=2. So exponents 4.

(1.025)^4: Let me compute this more accurately.

1.025^1 = 1.025
1.025^2 = 1.025 * 1.025 = 1.050625
1.025^3 = 1.050625 * 1.025 = let's compute:

1.050625 * 1.025:

1.050625 * 1 = 1.050625

1.050625 * 0.025 = 0.026265625

So adding them gives 1.076890625.

1.025^4 = 1.076890625 * 1.025.

Compute this:

1.076890625 * 1.025.

1.076890625 * 1 = 1.076890625

1.076890625 * 0.025 = 0.026922265625

Adding them gives 1.103812890625.

So A2 = 2253.65 * 1.103812890625.

Let me compute this precisely.

2253.65 * 1.103812890625.

Wait, perhaps I can split this into 1.1 and 0.003812890625.

Alternatively, compute 2253.65 * 1.103812890625.

Let me do it step by step.

First, 2253.65 * 1 = 2253.65

2253.65 * 0.1 = 225.365

2253.65 * 0.003812890625 = ?

Compute 2253.65 * 0.003812890625.

Hmm, 0.003812890625 is approximately 0.00381289.

So 2253.65 * 0.00381289.

Let me compute 2253.65 * 0.003 = 6.76095.

2253.65 * 0.00081289 = approx 2253.65 * 0.0008 = 1.80292, and 2253.65 * 0.00001289 ≈ 0.0290.

So total for 0.00081289 is about 1.80292 + 0.0290 = 1.83192.

So 0.00381289 is 0.003 + 0.00081289. So 6.76095 + 1.83192 = 8.59287.

So the 0.00381289 part contributes approximately 8.59287.

So adding all parts:

2253.65 (1) + 225.365 (0.1) + 8.59287 (0.00381289) = 2253.65 + 225.365 = 2478. + 8.59287 = 2486.59287.

So A2 is approximately $2486.59.

Now, the interest earned is 2486.59 - 2000 = 486.59.

Looking at the options:

Option H: $2487.61 and $487.61.

Option D: $2503.76 and $503.76.

Hmm, my calculation is $2486.59, which is close to $2487.61. But let me check if I missed something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (1.025)^4.

Wait, (1.025)^4:

1.025^2 is 1.050625.

1.050625 * 1.025 = 1.076890625.

1.076890625 * 1.025:

Let me compute this again.

1.076890625 * 1.025.

Let me break it down as (1 + 0.025) * 1.076890625.

Which is 1.076890625 + (1.076890625 * 0.025).

1.076890625 * 0.025 is 0.026922265625.

Adding to 1.076890625 gives 1.103812890625.

So that's correct.

So A2 is 2253.65 * 1.103812890625.

Wait, perhaps a more precise way to calculate 2253.65 * 1.103812890625.

Let me write it as 2253.65 * (1 + 0.1 + 0.003812890625).

Wait, perhaps I can compute 2253.65 * 1.103812890625.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the exponent approach, but it's getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use logarithms, but that's probably beyond what's needed here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise multiplication.

Wait, 2253.65 * 1.103812890625.

Let me compute 2253.65 multiplied by 1.103812890625.

I can compute 2253.65 * 1.10381289 as:

First, 2253.65 * 1 = 2253.65

Then, 2253.65 * 0.10381289.

Wait, 0.10381289 is 0.1 + 0.00381289.

So 2253.65 * 0.1 = 225.365.

2253.65 * 0.00381289 = ?

Compute 2253.65 * 0.003 = 6.76095

2253.65 * 0.00081289 = let's compute:

0.0008 * 2253.65 = 1.80292

0.00001289 * 2253.65 ≈ 0.0290.

So 1.80292 + 0.0290 = 1.83192.

So 0.00381289 * 2253.65 = 6.76095 + 1.83192 = 8.59287.

So 0.10381289 * 2253.65 = 225.365 + 8.59287 = 233.95787.

So total A2 = 2253.65 + 233.95787 = 2487.60787.

So approximately $2487.61.

Ah, so that's why option H is $2487.61. So the final amount is $2487.61.

The interest earned is 2487.61 - 2000 = $487.61.

So looking at the options, option H is final balance $2487.61 and interest $487.61.

Wait, option H says both $2487.61 and $487.61.

Another option, option A is $2487.61 and $487.65. Hmm, that's very close. But I think our calculation came to $2487.61 and interest $487.61.

So the correct answer should be option H.
</think>

To solve the problem, we calculate the final balance and the total interest earned in the savings account using the compound interest formula:

\[
A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}
\]

### Step 1: First 3 years (4% interest, compounded quarterly)
- Principal (\(P\)) = $2000
- Annual interest rate (\(r\)) = 4% = 0.04
- Compounding frequency (\(n\)) = 4 (quarterly)
- Time (\(t\)) = 3 years

\[
A_1 = 2000 \left(1 + \frac{0.04}{4}\right)^{4 \cdot 3} = 2000 \left(1 + 0.01\right)^{12}
\]

Using \((1.01)^{12} \approx 1.126825\):

\[
A_1 = 2000 \cdot 1.126825 = 2253.65
\]

After 3 years, the amount is **$2253.65**.

---

### Step 2: Next 2 years (5% interest, compounded semiannually)
- New principal (\(P\)) = $2253.65
- Annual interest rate (\(r\)) = 5% = 0.05
- Compounding frequency (\(n\)) = 2 (semiannually)
- Time (\(t\)) = 2 years

\[
A_2 = 2253.65 \left(1 + \frac{0.05}{2}\right)^{2 \cdot 2} = 2253.65 \left(1 + 0.025\right)^4
\]

Using \((1.025)^4 \approx 1.10381289\):

\[
A_2 = 2253.65 \cdot 1.10381289 \approx 2487.61
\]

After 2 years, the final balance is **$2487.61**.

---

### Step 3: Total interest earned
The total interest earned is the difference between the final balance and the initial principal:

\[
\text{Interest} = A_2 - P = 2487.61 - 2000 = 487.61
\]

---

### Final Answer
The final balance is **$2487.61**, and the total interest earned is **$487.61**. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**H: $2487.61 and $487.61**

H
