Okay, so I have this problem about osmotic pressure and molecular weight. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

So the problem says: the osmotic pressure of an unknown substance is measured at 298 K. The concentration is 31.2 kg/m³, and the osmotic pressure is 5.30e4 Pa. The solution's density is 997 kg/m³. I need to find the molecular weight from the options given.

Wait, I remember that osmotic pressure is related to the concentration of the solution. Oh right, the formula is π = iCRT, where π is osmotic pressure, i is the van't Hoff factor, C is concentration, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature. But wait, I think for dilute solutions, we can approximate i as 1, assuming the solute doesn't dissociate much. So maybe I can ignore i for now, or treat it as 1.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The concentration given is in kg/m³, which I think is mass concentration, like mass per volume. But the formula uses molar concentration, which is moles per volume. Oh right, so I'll probably need to convert between these.

So I need to relate the osmotic pressure to the molar concentration. Let me write down what I know.

Given:
- π (osmotic pressure) = 5.30e4 Pa
- T = 298 K
- Concentration (mass/volume) c = 31.2 kg/m³ → which is 31.2 kg per cubic meter. Wait, 1 kg is 1000 g, so 31.2 kg/m³ is 31200 g/m³. But wait, molarity is moles per liter, so I might need to convert units.

Wait, but the formula for osmotic pressure is π = (n/V) R T, where n/V is the molar concentration. So the molar concentration is n/V = π/(RT). Once I find n/V, I can relate it to the mass concentration to find the molecular weight.

Wait, let me clarify. Let me denote:

c (mass concentration) = (mass of solute) / (volume of solution)
M (molar concentration) = (moles of solute) / (volume of solution) = c / Mm, where Mm is molar mass.

Wait, because moles = mass / molar_mass. So M = c / Mm.

Wait, so M = (c / Mm). So then, π = M R T = (c / Mm) R T.

Rearranging to solve for Mm: Mm = (c R T) / π.

Hmm, but I need to make sure the units are correct.

Wait, let me check the units. Let's see:

c is given in kg/m³. Let's convert that to g/m³ by multiplying by 1e3. So 31.2 kg/m³ is 31200 g/m³.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to convert everything into SI units. Let me make sure.

So the formula I have is Mm = (c * R * T) / π.

But wait, let's make sure about the units of 'c'. Because 'c' is mass per volume. So in kg/m³. Let's write all units in SI.

R is the gas constant, which is 8.314 J/(mol·K). J is kg·m²/s².

So R has units of (kg·m²/s²)/(mol·K).

T is in K.

π is in Pa, which is N/m². N is kg·m/s², so Pa is kg/(m·s²).

So putting units into the formula Mm = (c * R * T) / π.

Let me compute the units on the right side:

c is kg/m³.

R is (kg·m²/s²)/(mol·K).

T is K.

π is kg/(m·s²).

So the numerator's units: (kg/m³) * (kg m²/(s² mol K)) ) * K.

Multiply them out:

kg * kg m²/(s² mol K) * K / m³.

Wait, the K cancels. So:

kg^2 m²/(s² mol m³) ) → because m³ in denominator.

Wait, kg squared? Hmm, let me recheck:

Wait, c is kg/m³. R is kg m²/(s² mol K). T is K.

So (c * R * T) has units:

(kg/m³) * (kg m²/(s² mol K)) * K.

Multiply them together:

kg * kg m² * K / (m³ * s² mol * K).

The K cancels. So we have kg² m²/(m³ s² mol).

Simplify m²/m³ → 1/m. So kg²/(m s² mol).

Now the denominator of the Mm equation is π, which is kg/(m s²).

So the entire units for Mm are:

(kg²/(m s² mol)) / (kg/(m s²)) ) → (kg² / (m s² mol)) ) * (m s² / kg) )

Simplify:

kg² * m s² / (m s² * kg * mol) )

The m in numerator and denominator cancels. s² cancels. So:

kg² / (kg mol) → kg/mol.

Which is correct, since Mm is kg/mol, because molar mass is in kg per mol (since 1 g/mol is 0.001 kg/mol).

Wait, but I think I might have confused something. Because Mm is usually expressed in g/mol. So perhaps I made a mistake in unit conversion.

Wait, let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I should convert c into grams per liter, because molar concentration is usually in mol/L.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula in terms of grams and liters would make it easier.

Wait, let me try that approach.

So, c is given as 31.2 kg/m³. Let me convert that to g/L because 1 m³ is 1000 L, and 1 kg is 1000 g.

So 31.2 kg/m³ = 31.2 * 1000 g / 1000 L = 31.2 g/L. Oh wait, because 1 m³ is a million liters (1000 L = 1 m³, so 1 m³ = 1000 L? No, wait, 1 m³ is 1000 liters. Because 1 m = 10^3 mm, so 1 m³ is (10^3 cm)^3 = 1e6 cm³, and 1 L is 1e3 cm³, so 1 m³ = 1e3 L. So 1 m³ = 1000 L.

So 31.2 kg/m³ is 31.2 kg per 1000 L. To get g/L, convert kg to g: 31.2 kg = 31200 g. So 31200 g per 1000 L → 31.2 g/L. Oh, so c = 31.2 g/L.

Wait, that's much easier. So now, c is 31.2 g/L.

Now, the formula for osmotic pressure is π = cRT, where c is molar concentration (mol/L), R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), but wait, or I can use R as 8.314 J/(mol·K). Wait, but using R as 8.314 will require me to convert units correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula with units that make sense.

Wait, the osmotic pressure formula can also be written as π = (n/V) R T, where n/V is mol/L, R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), and T is in Kelvin.

Wait, but the osmotic pressure given is in Pascals, not in atm. So I need to convert units.

Let me think of R in terms of units that can give Pascals. R is 8.314 J/(mol·K). Since 1 J = 1 N·m, and 1 Pa = 1 N/m².

So 8.314 J/(mol·K) = 8.314 (N·m)/(mol·K).

So, when I multiply by T (K) and by concentration (mol/m³), because molar concentration can be expressed as mol/m³.

Wait, perhaps I should convert c from g/L to kg/m³ or to mol/m³.

Wait, let me make a plan. I need to find the molar mass (Mm) given by:

Mm = (c * R * T) / π

But I need to make sure the units are correct.

Wait, c is the mass concentration in kg/m³. So 31.2 kg/m³.

R is 8.314 J/(mol·K) → J is N·m.

So, let's plug everything into the formula.

Mm = (c * R * T) / π

Plugging in the values:

c = 31.2 kg/m³

R = 8.314 J/(mol·K) → since J = kg·m²/s², R is (kg·m²/s²)/(mol·K).

T = 298 K

π = 5.30e4 Pa → which is 5.3e4 kg/(m·s²).

So, let's compute each part.

First, compute numerator: c * R * T

c = 31.2 kg/m³

R*T = 8.314 * 298 ≈ let's compute that.

8.314 * 300 is 2494.2, but since 298 is 2 less, 8.314 * 2 = 16.628, so 2494.2 - 16.628 = 2477.572.

So R*T ≈ 2477.572 J/(mol).

Now, numerator is 31.2 kg/m³ * 2477.572 J/mol.

Wait, but J is kg·m²/s², so this becomes:

31.2 [kg/m³] * 2477.572 [kg·m²/(s²·mol)].

Multiply these together:

31.2 * 2477.572 = let's calculate that.

Hmm, 30 * 2477 is 74310, and 1.2 * 2477 is about 2972. So total is about 74310 + 2972 = 77282 kg²·m²/(s²·mol·m³).

Wait, but the units are kg * (kg m²/(s² mol)) ) / m³ → kg² m²/(s² mol m³) → kg²/(s² mol m).

Denominator is π = 5.3e4 Pa = 5.3e4 kg/(m s²).

So Mm is numerator / denominator → (kg²/(s² mol m)) ) / (kg/(m s²)) ) → (kg²) * (m s²) ) / (s² mol m * kg) ) → kg / mol.

Which is correct, because Mm is kg/mol.

So let's compute the numerical value.

Numerator: 31.2 * 2477.572 ≈ 77282.5 (from earlier), but I should calculate more accurately.

Wait, 31.2 * 2477.572:

Let me compute 31 * 2477.572 = ?

2477.572 *30 = 74327.16

2477.572 *1 = 2477.572

So total 74327.16 + 2477.572 = 76804.732.

Then, plus 0.2 * 2477.572 = 495.514. So 76804.732 + 495.514 = 77300.246.

So numerator ≈77300.246 kg²·m²/(s²·mol·m).

Denominator is 5.3e4 kg/(m s²).

So Mm = 77300.246 / (5.3e4) kg/mol.

Wait, let me compute 77300.246 / 53000.

Hmm, 53000 * 1.457 = 53000 *1.4=74200, 53000 *0.057= 3021 → total 77221.

So approximately 1.457.

Wait, 53000 * 1.457 ≈ 77221, which is just a bit less than 77300. So the actual value is a bit higher.

Compute 77300.246 / 53000 = 77300.246 / 5.3e4.

Let me compute 77300.246 ÷ 53000.

Divide numerator and denominator by 100: 773.00246 / 530.

530 goes into 773 once (530 → 243 left). Bring down a zero: 2430.

530 goes into 2430 4 times (4*530=2120) → 310 left. Bring down zero → 3100.

530 goes into 3100 5 times (5*530=2650), remainder 450. Bring down zero → 4500.

530 goes into 4500 8 times (8*530=4240), remainder 260. Bring down zero → 2600.

530 goes into 2600 4 times (4*530=2120), rem 480. Bring down zero → 4800.

Wait, this is getting tedious. Alternatively, approximate:

53000 * 1.4578 ≈77300.

So Mm ≈1.4578 kg/mol.

Wait, 1.4578 kg/mol is the same as 1457.8 g/mol.

Looking at the options, the numbers are in the 1e3 range.

Option C is 1.78e3 g/mol, which is 1780 g/mol.

Wait, but I got 1457.8 g/mol, which is roughly 1.46e3 g/mol. Looking back at the options, option F is 1.45e3, which is 1450 g/mol. That's close to my calculation.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check my calculations because maybe I made a mistake in unit conversion.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the initial unit conversion. Let me try a different approach.

Alternative approach:

Given that c (mass concentration) is 31.2 kg/m³, which is 31.2 g/L (as 1 kg/m³ = 1 g/L, because 1 m³ = 1000 L, 1 kg = 1000 g, so kg/m³ = g/L). So c =31.2 g/L.

The osmotic pressure is given by π = (c / Mm) * R * T, where c is in g/L, R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), but wait, using R in those units would give π in atm.

But since the given π is in Pascals, perhaps I should use R = 8.314 J/(mol·K) and convert atm to Pascals.

Wait, let me get the formula right.

The formula: π = (n/V) R T, where n/V is molarity (mol/L). n/V = (mass concentration c (g/L)) / Mm (g/mol).

So π = (c/Mm) * R * T.

But R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), and T is in K. So π will be in J/(m³), because J = Pa·m³.

Wait, let me clarify.

Wait, J is N·m. Pa is N/m². So 1 J = 1 N·m = (1 N) * (1 m) = (1 kg·m/s²) * m = kg·m²/s².

So, 1 Pa = 1 N/m² = kg/(m·s²).

So, 1 J = 1 Pa * m³.

So, 1 Pa = 1 J/m³.

So if I compute π in J/m³, that's the same as Pascals.

So, let's proceed.

Given:

c = 31.2 g/L = 31.2 kg/m³ (Wait, no, 31.2 kg/m³ is 31200 g/m³. Wait, I'm getting confused with units.)

Wait, no. Let me clarify:

1 kg/m³ = 1 g/L.

Because 1 kg = 1000 g, 1 m³ = 1000 L. So (1 kg/m³) = (1000 g)/(1000 L) ) = 1 g/L.

So, 31.2 kg/m³ = 31.2 g/L. That part I had right earlier.

So, c = 31.2 g/L.

So, π = (c / Mm) * R * T.

We can rearrange for Mm: Mm = (c * R * T) / π.

But π is given in Pascals, which is J/m³. R is in J/(mol·K). So let's compute:

c is in g/L. Oh wait, but to have consistent units, perhaps it's better to convert c to kg/m³.

Wait, maybe I should make sure all units are in SI.

So, c = 31.2 kg/m³.

R = 8.314 J/(mol·K).

T = 298 K.

π = 5.3e4 Pa = 5.3e4 J/m³.

So, Mm = (c * R * T) / π.

Plugging in the numbers:

(31.2 kg/m³) * (8.314 J/(mol·K)) * 298 K ) / (5.3e4 J/m³).

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

First, compute R*T: 8.314 * 298 ≈ 2477.57 J/mol.

So, numerator: 31.2 * 2477.57 = ?

31 * 2477.57 = let's compute:

30 * 2477.57 = 74327.1

1 * 2477.57 = 2477.57 → total 74327.1 + 2477.57 = 76804.67.

Then, 0.2 * 2477.57 = 495.51. So total numerator is 76804.67 + 495.51 = 77300.18 kg·J/(mol·m³).

Wait, but J is kg·m²/s², so kg·J/(mol·m³) is kg*(kg·m²/s²)/(mol·m³) → kg²/(mol·m s²).

Denominator is π = 5.3e4 J/m³ → 5.3e4 kg·
