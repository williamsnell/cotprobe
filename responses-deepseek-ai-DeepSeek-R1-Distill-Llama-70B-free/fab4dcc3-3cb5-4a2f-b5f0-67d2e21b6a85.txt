Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the volume of a block of wood with given dimensions. Hmm, let's see. The dimensions are 25.0 meters, 10.0 centimeters, and 300 millimeters. Oh wait, all the edges are at 90 degrees to each other, which means it's a rectangular prism, right? So the volume should be length multiplied by width multiplied by height. 

But wait, the units are all different. I need to convert them to the same unit before multiplying. The question asks for the volume in cubic centimeters (cc), so I should convert everything to centimeters. 

Let me think about each dimension:

1. The first dimension is 25.0 meters. I know that 1 meter is 100 centimeters, so 25 meters would be 25 * 100 = 2500 centimeters.

2. The second is 10.0 centimeters. That's already in centimeters, so no conversion needed there. So that's just 10.0 cm.

3. The third is 300 millimeters. Oh right, 1 centimeter is 10 millimeters, so to convert millimeters to centimeters, I divide by 10. 300 divided by 10 is 30. So that's 30 centimeters.

Now, all the dimensions are in centimeters: 2500 cm, 10.0 cm, and 30 cm. 

So the volume should be 2500 * 10.0 * 30. Let me calculate that step by step. 

First, 2500 multiplied by 10 is 25,000. Then, 25,000 multiplied by 30. Hmm, 25,000 times 30 would be 750,000. Because 25,000 * 30 is like 25,000 * 3 * 10, which is 75,000 * 10, so 750,000. 

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations. 2500 * 10 is indeed 25,000. Then 25,000 * 30. Let me write it out: 25,000 * 30 = 750,000. Yeah that's right.

So the volume is 750,000 cubic centimeters. Now I look at the options. Let's see the options:

Option A: 7.50 × 10^5 cc. Wait, 7.5e5 is 750,000. So that's 750,000. Option B is 75000, which is 7.5e4. Option C is 3.75e5, which is 375,000. Option D is 750 cc, which is way too small. Option E is 3e5, which is 300,000. Option F is 2500, way too small. Option G is 1e6, which is 1,000,000. H is 2.5e6, which is 2,500,000. I is 7.5e4, so 75,000. J is 1.5e5, which is 150,000.

So the volume I got is 750,000, which is 7.5e5. So that's option A. But wait, looking at the options, option A is 7.50e5 cc, which matches. Option B is 75,000, which is an order of magnitude less. So I think the correct answer is option A.

Wait, did I make a mistake in unit conversion? Let me double-check. 

25 meters to cm: 25 * 100 = 2500 cm. Correct.

300 mm is 300 /10 = 30 cm. Correct.

10 cm is 10. So 2500 * 10 is 25,000, times 30 is 750,000. Yep, that's right.

So the answer should be A.

To determine the volume of the block of wood, we first convert all dimensions to centimeters (cm) since the final answer is required in cubic centimeters (cc). The given dimensions are:

1. **25.0 meters**:  
   Since \( 1 \, \text{m} = 100 \, \text{cm} \),  
   \( 25.0 \, \text{m} = 25.0 \times 100 = 2500 \, \text{cm} \).

2. **10.0 centimeters**:  
   This is already in centimeters, so no conversion is needed.

3. **300 millimeters**:  
   Since \( 1 \, \text{cm} = 10 \, \text{mm} \),  
   \( 300 \, \text{mm} = \frac{300}{10} = 30 \, \text{cm} \).

Now, all dimensions are in centimeters: \( 2500 \, \text{cm} \times 10.0 \, \text{cm} \times 30 \, \text{cm} \). The volume of a rectangular prism is calculated as:

\[
\text{Volume} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Volume} = 2500 \times 10.0 \times 30 = 750,000 \, \text{cc}
\]

This can also be expressed in scientific notation as \( 7.50 \times 10^5 \, \text{cc} \).

Comparing this result with the provided options:

- **Option A**: \( 7.50 \times 10^5 \, \text{cc} \) matches the calculated volume.  
- Other options are either incorrect in magnitude or unit conversion.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**A**
