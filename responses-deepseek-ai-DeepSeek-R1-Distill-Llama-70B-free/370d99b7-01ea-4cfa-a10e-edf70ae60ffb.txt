Question:

As part of an externship program conducted by his law school, a law student went to work for a lawyer as a clerk. After six months, the lawyer was very impressed with the law student's work. He called the law student into his office and told him, "I know you were only to work for me for six months in exchange for credit in your law school extemship program. However, I'd like you to stay on as a clerk. I'll pay you $25 an hour for any work you do for me between now and the bar exam. In addition, if you put in a minimum of 10 hours per week during that time, I promise to hire you full-time as an associate when you pass the bar exam. " The attorney then reduced this agreement to writing, which both he and the law student signed. The law student continued to work for the lawyer throughout the rest of his law school career and while he was studying for the bar exam. During that time, the law student always worked a minimum of 10 hours per week. While the law student was awaiting the results of the bar exam, his uncle passed away and left him a large apartment building. The law student decided he did not want to practice law but wanted to spend all of his time managing the apartment building. He told his roommate, a fellow law student who was awaiting his bar results, about his plans and told the roommate he would assign to the roommate the right to be hired by the lawyer as an associate, in exchange for $100. The roommate paid the $100 to the law student, who then executed a written assignment of the right to be hired by the lawyer as an associate. The roommate passed the bar exam, but the lawyer refused to hire him as an associate. Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the legal effect of this assignment?

Options:

A: The lawyer would be required to recognize the validity of the assignment, because the roommate passed the bar exam and is therefore qualified.
B: The lawyer would not be required to recognize the validity of the assignment, because neither the rights nor the duties under a personal service contract are properly assignable.
C: The lawyer would not be required to recognize the validity of the assignment, because the original contract was between the lawyer and the law student, not the roommate.
D: The lawyer would be required to recognize the validity of the assignment, but would be entitled to demand adequate assurances of performance from the roommate as to the latter's willingness and professional capacity to perform satisfactory work.
E: The lawyer would be required to recognize the validity of the assignment, but only if the roommate can prove he is capable of performing the duties of an associate.
F: The lawyer would not be required to recognize the validity of the assignment, because the original agreement was not intended to be assignable.
G: The lawyer would not be required to recognize the validity of the assignment, because the assignment was made in exchange for money, altering the original terms of the agreement.
H: The lawyer would be required to recognize the validity of the assignment, but would be entitled to demand adequate assurances of performance from the roommate as to the latter's willingness and financial capacity to perform satisfactory work.
I: The lawyer would not be required to recognize the validity of the assignment of rights, because a contract to make a future assignment of a right is not an assignment.
J: The lawyer would be required to recognize the validity of the assignment so that the roommate would be entitled to be hired as an associate.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about contract law, specifically dealing with assignments. Hmm, let's try to unpack this step by step.

First, let me read through the question carefully. A law student did an externship with a lawyer and then was offered a paid clerkship until the bar exam, with a promise of a full-time associate position if he worked at least 10 hours a week. They had a written agreement. The student continued working, fulfilled the 10-hour requirement, and then inherited an apartment building. He decided not to practice law and assigned his right to be hired as an associate to his roommate for $100. The roommate passed the bar but the lawyer refused to hire him. The question is about the validity of this assignment.

I remember that assignment of contractual rights can be tricky. Generally, contract rights are assignable unless there's a specific restriction. But some contracts, especially for personal services, might not be assignable because the duty is personal. So, if the original contract was for personal services, like the lawyer expecting the specific skills of the student, then the right to have that service performed can't be assigned without consent.

Wait, but in this case, the lawyer's promise is to hire the student once he passes the bar. So maybe the right being assigned is the right to the associate position, not the duty to perform services. So the student is assigning the benefit of the contract, which is the right to be hired.

Now, can that right be assigned? I think most rights can be assigned unless the contract says otherwise. But there's an exception for personal service contracts where the services are based on the individual's unique skills or where the obligor (the lawyer) has a particular interest in who performs the service.

In this scenario, the lawyer agreed to hire the student as an associate upon passing the bar. So the lawyer might have chosen the student based on his skills, work ethic, etc. If the student assigns that right to someone else, the roommate, the lawyer might argue that it's a personal service contract and thus not assignable.

Alternatively, the lawyer could argue that the original agreement was based on the student's personal qualities, making it a personal service contract. Assigning such a right would not be enforceable because the lawyer didn't agree to hire just anyone—it was specifically the student.

Looking at the options:

Option B says the assignment isn't valid because neither rights nor duties under a personal service contract are assignable. Wait, but duties are about the obligor's responsibilities, but here we're talking about assigning the right (benefit), not the duty. So maybe B is incorrect because it's referring to both rights and duties.

Option C says the lawyer doesn't have to recognize the assignment because the original contract was between him and the student. That doesn't seem right because assignments can transfer the benefit to a third party unless prohibited.

Option E says the lawyer must recognize it if the roommate can prove capability. But the issue isn't the roommate's capability; it's whether the assignment is valid in the first place.

Option D and H talk about demanding assurances, but I don't think that's the main issue here. The question is whether the assignment is valid, not about performance.

Option J says the lawyer must recognize it, but I'm not sure because of the personal service angle.

Option F says the original agreement wasn't intended to be assignable. But unless the contract specifies that, the general rule is that it's assignable unless it's personal services.

So if the lawyer's obligation was based on the student's personal qualities, the assignment might not be allowed. So the lawyer doesn't have to recognize it because it's a personal service contract, making the right non-assignable.

Wait, in contract law, the general rule is that the right to receive a benefit can be assigned unless the contract prohibits it or it's a personal service where the obligor has a substantial interest in having the original obligee perform. So the lawyer might have a legitimate interest in who becomes the associate, making the contract one of personal service.

Therefore, the assignment isn't enforceable because it's a personal service contract. So looking at the options, option B says neither rights nor duties are assignable in personal service contracts. Wait, but duties can't be assigned without consent, but rights can be unless it's a personal service.

Wait, I might be confusing. The right to receive a benefit is assignable, but in personal service contracts, the right may not be assignable because the obligor is relying on the specific individual.

So perhaps the lawyer's obligation is personal, making the right non-assignable. So the correct answer would be B, but wait, option B says neither rights nor duties are assignable. But in reality, it's the duty that can't be assigned without consent. The right is generally assignable unless it's a personal service.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The assignment here is of the right to be hired, which is a benefit. But if the original contract is for personal services, the benefit might not be assignable.

Alternatively, maybe the lawyer's promise is a unilateral contract where the student's performance (working 10 hours) was consideration, and the offer is to hire upon passing the bar. But once the condition is met, the right vests, and perhaps can be assigned.

But I think the key is whether the contract is considered personal. If the lawyer intended to hire the student based on their specific abilities, then the assignment would not be valid. So the lawyer doesn't have to accept the roommate as the assignee.

Looking at the options, option B says that in personal service contracts, neither rights nor duties are assignable. But the duty side isn't in question here—the roommate isn't being assigned any duties; the student's duties were fulfilled. The assignment is about the right to the lawyer's performance (hiring).

Wait, maybe the correct reasoning is that the original contract was a personal service contract, so the right to the promise (hiring) cannot be assigned. Therefore, the lawyer doesn't have to recognize the assignment.

So the options that align with this reasoning would be option B, because personal service contracts' rights aren't assignable. But wait, option B says neither rights nor duties are assignable. But in reality, duties can't be assigned without consent, but the right to receive payment or a benefit can be assigned unless it's a personal service.

Alternatively, another approach: the lawyer's obligation was to hire the student upon passing the bar. That's a promise for future employment. Such promises are often considered personal, so assigning them would not be allowed unless the obligor (lawyer) consents.

So in this case, the assignment is invalid because the right is based on personal services, making option B the correct answer.

Wait, but another thought: the initial agreement was about the lawyer hiring the student as an associate. The student did the required work, so the lawyer's obligation became fixed once the student passed the bar. So maybe the right to the job is now a vested right that can be assigned.

Alternatively, the lawyer's promise was to hire the student, not just anyone. So the student can't assign that right because it's personal.

So yes, option B is the correct answer because it's a personal service contract, and the rights are not assignable.

The question revolves around the assignability of a contractual right in the context of a personal service contract. The law student and the lawyer entered into an agreement where the lawyer promised to hire the student as an associate upon passing the bar exam, provided the student worked a minimum of 10 hours per week. The student later assigned this right to his roommate in exchange for $100. The issue is whether this assignment is valid and enforceable.

Under contract law, the general rule is that the right to receive a benefit under a contract is assignable unless the contract explicitly prohibits assignment or the contract is for personal services. Personal service contracts are based on the unique skills, qualifications, or expectations of the original party, and assigning such rights without the obligor's consent is generally not allowed.

In this case, the lawyer's promise to hire the student as an associate was likely based on the student's specific qualifications, work ethic, and performance during the clerkship. This makes the contract a personal service contract. As a result, the student's right to be hired cannot be assigned to the roommate without the lawyer's consent. The assignment is therefore invalid, and the lawyer is not required to recognize it.

Option B correctly states that neither the rights nor the duties under a personal service contract are assignable, aligning with the reasoning that the lawyer's obligation was personal to the student and cannot be transferred without consent.

ANSWER: B
