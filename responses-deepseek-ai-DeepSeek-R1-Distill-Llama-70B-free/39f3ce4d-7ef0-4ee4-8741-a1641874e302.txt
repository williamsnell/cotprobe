Okay, so I've got this question about the synoptic Gospels, and I'm a bit rusty on my Bible studies, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what I know.

The term "synoptic" comes from Greek words meaning "seen together" or "same eye". I remember that it refers to the Gospels that tell many of the same stories about Jesus, often in a similar order. So, they're kind of like three different perspectives on the same events.

The four Gospels in the New Testament are Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Now, I think John is considered different from the others because his Gospel is more theological and doesn't include as many of the same stories as the others. So, I don't think John is part of the synoptic group.

That leaves Matthew, Mark, and Luke as the synoptic ones. But wait, why are they called synoptic? Oh, right, because they share a lot of the same events and even similar wording in places. Like, the parables, the miracles, and the events leading up to the crucifixion are covered similarly in all three.

So looking at the options, I need to find the one that includes Matthew, Mark, and Luke. Let me check each option:

Option E is Matthew, Mark, Luke. That must be the correct answer. Other options either include John, Paul, Peter, or others who aren't part of the Gospels. Paul wrote epistles, not Gospels. Peter is an apostle, but the Gospel of Peter isn't one of the canonical ones. So yeah, E should be the right choice.

The synoptic Gospels are Matthew, Mark, and Luke because they share similar narratives and events about Jesus, differing from John, which is more theological. Among the options, only E includes these three.

Answer: E
