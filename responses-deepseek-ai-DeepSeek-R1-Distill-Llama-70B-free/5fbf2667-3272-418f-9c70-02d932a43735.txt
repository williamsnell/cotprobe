Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about waves at an interface. Hmm, I need to find the critical angle and the field strength in air. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem states that distilled water has a relative permittivity εr of 81 and relative permeability μr of 1. The wave is incident from water onto a water-air interface. The incident electric field E1 is 1 V/m, and the incident angle is 45 degrees.

I remember that when dealing with wave transmission at an interface, especially between two media, things like Snell's law and Fresnel equations come into play. Oh wait, but first, what's the critical angle? The critical angle is the angle of incidence above which total internal reflection occurs. But wait, in this case, the wave is going from water (higher refractive index) to air (lower refractive index). So the critical angle would be when the refracted angle is 90 degrees.

Wait, the refractive index n is given by sqrt(μr * εr). Since μr is 1 for both, n_water = sqrt(81) = 9. And for air, n_air is sqrt(1*1)=1. So when moving from water to air, the critical angle is when the refracted angle is 90 degrees. Using Snell's law, n_water * sin(theta_c) = n_air * sin(90). Sin(90) is 1, so sin(theta_c) = n_air / n_water = 1/9 ≈ 0.1111. So theta_c is arcsin(1/9) which is approximately 6.4 degrees. Wait, but in the problem, the incident angle is 45 degrees, which is way larger than 6.4, so that would mean total internal reflection, right? But wait, the problem doesn't say anything about reflection; it's about transmission. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, no, wait. Maybe the wave is incident from water to air. But when the incident angle is larger than the critical angle, there's no transmission; it's all reflected. So in this problem, since 45 degrees is way larger than 6.4, wouldn't there be no transmission? But the question is asking about the field strength in air, both at the interface and a quarter wavelength away. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake about the critical angle. Let me double-check. The formula for critical angle is indeed arcsin(n2/n1), where n1 is the incident medium, n2 the transmitted. So since n_water =9, n_air=1, n2/n1=1/9, so theta_c is about 6.43 degrees. So any angle above that, like 45, is beyond the critical angle. So total internal reflection occurs, which would mean that the wave does not transmit into the air. But the problem is giving me E1=1 V/m and asking about E in air. Hmm, that's confusing. Unless I'm missing a different approach here.

Wait, perhaps the question is about evanescent waves. Even beyond the critical angle, an evanescent wave exists in the second medium (air), but it doesn't propagate. So the fields decay exponentially. But the problem asks for the field strength at the interface and at a distance lambda/4 away, so maybe it's considering this evanescent field.

But wait, the problem says to calculate the field in air at the interface and lambda/4 away. So perhaps I should proceed.

Alternatively, if the incident angle is 45 degrees, which is beyond the critical angle of ~6.4, so total internal reflection occurs. The transmitted wave would be evanescent. So the electric field in air would be the evanescent wave's field.

So for part (a), the field at the interface (distance x=0), and part (b) at x= lambda/4.

But I thought that in the case of total internal reflection, the transmitted field at x=0 is related to the incident and reflected fields. Let me think. The Fresnel equations for electric fields when going from medium 1 to medium 2. But since this is beyond the critical angle, the transmission coefficients might be different.

Wait, the Fresnel transmission coefficient for E in the case of TE polarization (s-polarization) is t = (2 n1 cos(theta_i)) / (n1 cos(theta_i) + n2 cos(theta_t)). But when theta_i > theta_c, theta_t becomes complex, and so cos(theta_t) becomes imaginary. So the denominator becomes n1 cos(theta_i) + i n2 sqrt( (n1^2/n2^2) sin^2(theta_i) -1 ) ). Hmm, that gets a bit complicated.

Alternatively, the evanescent wave's amplitude at the interface is given by E_t = E1 * t, where t is the transmission coefficient. But beyond the critical angle, the transmission coefficient for the evanescent wave can be found.

Wait, another approach: When light is totally internally reflected, the transmitted (evanescent) field can be calculated using the Fresnel transmission coefficients with the understanding that beyond critical angle, the wave is evanescent.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the reflection and transmission coefficients, taking into account the phase shifts.

Wait, let me think about this again. The wave is incident from water (n=9) to air (n=1), at 45 degrees. Since 45 > 6.4, so total internal reflection. But the question is about the transmitted field in air, which is the evanescent wave.

The transmission coefficient for electric field when going from medium 1 to medium 2 (for TE polarization) is t = [2 n1 cos(theta_i)] / [n1 cos(theta_i) + n2 cos(theta_t)].

But when theta_i > theta_c, theta_t is imaginary, so cos(theta_t) is imaginary. So let me compute cos(theta_t) when theta_t is complex. Using Snell's law, n_water sin(theta_i) = n_air sin(theta_t). But since theta_i > theta_c, sin(theta_t) would be >1, which isn't possible, so theta_t is complex. Let me compute sin(theta_t) = (n_water / n_air) sin(theta_i) = 9 * sin(45) ≈9*(√2/2)= (9√2)/2 ≈6.363. So sin(theta_t)=6.363, which is greater than 1, so theta_t is a complex angle. Let me represent theta_t as theta_t = pi/2 + i phi, where phi is real. Then, using the identity for sin(pi/2 + i phi) = cos(i phi) = cosh(phi). So, sin(theta_t) = cosh(phi) = 6.363. So, cosh(phi) =6.363 → phi = arccosh(6.363) ≈ 1.83 radians (since cosh(1.83)= approx 6.3).

Then, cos(theta_t) is cos(pi/2 + i phi) = -sin(i phi) = -i sinh(phi). So cos(theta_t) is imaginary.

So substituting into the transmission coefficient t:

t = [2 n1 cos(theta_i)] / [n1 cos(theta_i) + n2 cos(theta_t) ]

n1=9, n2=1. theta_i is 45, so cos(theta_i)=√2/2≈0.7071.

So numerator: 2 *9 * 0.7071 ≈ 12.727.

Denominator: 9*(0.7071) + 1*(-i sinh(phi)).

Wait, sinh(phi)=sinh(1.83)≈ sinh(1.8)= approx 3.45, since sinh(1)=1.175, sinh(2)=3.63. So 1.83 is near 2, so maybe around 3.5?

So denominator is 9*0.7071=6.3639 + (-i *3.5) ≈6.3639 -i3.5.

So denominator is a complex number: 6.364 -j3.5.

Wait, but wait: cos(theta_t)= -i sinh(phi), so 1* cos(theta_t) = -i * sinh(phi) = -i*3.5.

So denominator is 9 * cos(theta_i) + 1 * cos(theta_t) → 6.3639 + (-i3.5) = 6.3639 -i3.5.

So the denominator is a complex number, D=6.3639 -i3.5.

So t is 12.727 / (6.3639 -i3.5).

To compute this, I'll rationalize the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator.

The complex conjugate is 6.3639 +i3.5.

So numerator becomes 12.727 * (6.3639 +i3.5).

Denominator becomes (6.3639)^2 + (3.5)^2.

Let me compute the denominator first:

6.3639^2 ≈ (6.364)^2 ≈40.53 (since 6^2=36, 0.364^2≈0.132, 2*6*0.364=4.368 → 36+4.368=40.368 +0.132≈40.5).

3.5^2=12.25. So denominator is 40.5 +12.25=52.75.

Now numerator: 12.727 * (6.3639 +i3.5).

Let me compute 12.727*6.3639 ≈ Let's approximate:

12.727 *6=76.362, 12.727*0.3639≈(12.727 *0.3)=3.818, 12.727 *0.0639≈0.813 → total 3.818+0.813≈4.631. So 76.362 +4.631≈80.993.

Then, 12.727 *3.5 = 44.5445.

So numerator is 80.993 +i44.5445.

So t ≈ (80.993 +i44.5445)/52.75.

Divide each part by 52.75:

80.993 /52.75 ≈1.536.

44.5445 /52.75≈0.844.

So t ≈1.536 +i0.844.

So the transmission coefficient t is a complex number with magnitude sqrt( (1.536)^2 + (0.844)^2 ) = sqrt(2.359 +0.712) = sqrt(3.071)≈1.752.

So the magnitude of the electric field in air at the interface (x=0) is E_t = E1 * |t|.

E1 is given as 1 V/m. So E_t ≈1 *1.752≈1.75 V/m.

But looking at the options, let's see. Option I says 2.00 V/m at interface, option H is 1.82, option G is 1.62, etc. Wait, but I'm getting around 1.75, which isn't exactly any of the options. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this using the evanescent wave formula.

In the case of total internal reflection, the transmitted electric field just inside medium 2 (air) is given by E_t = E1 * t, where t is the transmission coefficient. But perhaps the formula for t in this case is different.

Alternatively, another approach for the evanescent wave is to consider that the amplitude at the interface (x=0) is the same as the transmitted field. The field then decays exponentially as exp(-kx), where k is the decay constant.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the transmission coefficient more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should use the Fresnel transmission coefficients for the case when total internal reflection occurs. The formula for the transmission coefficient when theta_i > theta_c is given as t = [2 n1 cos(theta_i)] / (n1 cos(theta_i) + i n2 sqrt( (n1^2 /n2^2) sin^2(theta_i) -1 )) )

Wait, that's a different expression. Let me check a reference.

Yes, when theta_i > theta_c, the Fresnel transmission coefficient for TE (s) polarization is t = [2 n1 cos(theta_i)] / [n1 cos(theta_i) + i n2 sqrt( (n1/n2)^2 sin^2(theta_i) -1 ) ]

So let's compute this.

n1 is the refractive index of water, which is 9.

n2 is the refractive index of air, which is 1.

theta_i is 45 degrees, so cos(theta_i)=√2/2≈0.7071.

So numerator: 2 *9 *0.7071 ≈12.727.

Denominator:9 *0.7071 +i *1 * sqrt( (9^2)*(sin^2(45)) -1 )

Wait, let me compute the term inside the square root:

( (n1/n2)^2 sin^2(theta_i) -1 ) = ( (9/1)^2 * (sqrt(2)/2)^2 ) -1 = (81 * 0.5 ) -1 =40.5-1=39.5.

So sqrt(39.5)≈6.289.

So denominator becomes 9 *0.7071 +i*1*6.289 →6.3639 +i6.289.

So denominator is D=6.3639 +i6.289.

So t = 12.727 / (6.3639 +i6.289).

To compute this, multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator.

The complex conjugate is 6.3639 -i6.289.

So numerator becomes 12.727*(6.3639 -i6.289).

Denominator becomes (6.3639)^2 + (6.289)^2.

Compute denominator:

6.3639^2 ≈40.5.

6.289^2 ≈39.5.

So denominator≈40.5 +39.5=80.

Now numerator: 12.727 *6.3639 = let me compute:

12 *6.3639=76.3668.

0.727 *6.3639≈4.626.

So total ≈76.3668 +4.626≈80.9928.

Then 12.727 * (-i6.289) = -i * (12.727 *6.289).

Compute 12.727 *6.289:

12 *6=72. 12 *0.289≈3.468. 0.727 *6≈4.362. 0.727 *0.289≈0.209.

Adding up:72 +3.468=75.468. 4.362 +0.209≈4.571. Total 75.468+4.571≈80.039.

So numerator is 80.9928 -i80.039.

So t ≈ (80.9928 -i80.039)/80.

Divide each term:

80.9928/80 ≈1.0124.

80.039/80≈1.0005.

So t≈(1.0124 -i1.0005).

The magnitude of t is sqrt( (1.0124)^2 + (1.0005)^2 ) ≈sqrt(1.0249 +1.001)≈sqrt(2.0259)=approx 1.425.

So |t|≈1.425, which is about 1.43 V/m for E_t at the interface.

Wait, but the options don't have this exact value. Let me check the options again.

Option C: at interface 1.42, away 73.2e-6 V/m.

Option I: 2.00 and 90, which is higher.

Hmm, 1.42 is option C's interface value. So part (a) would be 1.42 V/m.

Now part (b), which is the field strength lambda/4 away from the interface.

The evanescent wave's amplitude decays as exp(-k x), where k is the decay constant. The decay constant k is given by (2π/λ_0) * sqrt( (n1^2 sin^2(theta_i)/n2^2) -1 )^(1/2) ?

Wait, alternatively, the propagation constant in the transmitted medium (air) is gamma = alpha +i beta, where alpha is the attenuation constant.

Wait, the decay is exponential, so E(x) = E_t * e^(-k x), where k = (2π/λ) * sqrt( (n1 sin(theta_i))^2 -n2^2 )/(n2) )

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Let me think.

In the evanescent wave, the field decays exponentially with distance x from the interface. The decay is governed by the factor exp(-k x), where k is given by:

k = (2π / λ_air) * sqrt( (n1 sin(theta_i))^2 - n2^2 ) / n2.

Wait, but wait, lambda_air is the wavelength in air, which is lambda_0 (free space) divided by n_air (which is 1), so lambda_air = lambda_0.

But lambda_water would be lambda_0 / n_water.

Wait, but for the calculation, perhaps it's better to compute the decay constant beta or k.

Alternatively, the field in air is given by:

E(x) = E_t * e^{-k x}, where k = (2π / λ_air) * sqrt( (n1 sin(theta_i))^2 -n2^2 ) / n2.

Wait, let me compute k.

n1 =9, theta_i=45 degrees, sin(theta_i)=√2/2≈0.7071.

n2=1.

So (n1 sin(theta_i))^2 = (9 * 0.7071)^2 = (6.3639)^2≈40.5.

So (n1 sin(theta_i))^2 -n2^2 =40.5 -1=39.5.

So sqrt(39.5)=6.289.

So k = (2π / lambda_air) * (6.289)/1 = (2π *6.289)/lambda_air.

But what's lambda_air? It's the wavelength in air. The frequency is the same as in water, so lambda_air = lambda_water * n_water.

Wait, but perhaps I should express everything in terms of lambda in vacuum.

Wait, let me think. The wavelength in medium 1 (water) is lambda_water = lambda_0 / n_water.

So lambda_0 is the free space wavelength. The frequency is the same, so
