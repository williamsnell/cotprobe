Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electron moving between energy levels and emitting light. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says an electron jumps from n=3 to n=2, emitting red light. They're asking for the magnitude of the quantum of energy. I remember that when electrons transition between energy levels, they emit or absorb photons, and the energy of the photon corresponds to the difference in energy between these levels.

Wait, I think the formula for the energy levels in a hydrogen atom is something like E_n = - (some constant) divided by n squared. Oh right, the Rydberg formula maybe? Or the energy levels formula. Yeah, E_n = -13.6 eV / n², but wait, sometimes it's expressed in joules. Oh, right, sometimes the constant is given in terms of the Rydberg constant.

Wait, the Rydberg energy is about 13.6 eV, but in joules, I think it's approximately 2.18e-18 J. Because 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So 13.6 eV times that would be around 2.18e-18 J. So E_n = - (2.18e-18 J) / n².

So the energy change when the electron transitions from n=3 to n=2 is the difference between these two levels. So delta E = E_initial - E_final. Wait, no, when the electron drops from a higher to a lower energy level, it emits a photon. So E_final is lower, so the energy of the photon is E_initial (higher) minus E_final (lower).

Wait, let me get this straight. The energy levels are negative, so E_n is negative. So E_3 is higher (less negative) than E_2. So when the electron drops from 3 to 2, it emits a photon with energy E_3 - E_2. Because E_3 is higher, E_3 - E_2 will be a positive value, the energy of the emitted photon.

So substituting the formula:

E_3 = -2.18e-18 / 3² = -2.18e-18 /9.

E_2 = -2.18e-18 / 2² = -2.18e-18 /4.

So delta E = E_3 - E_2 = (-2.18e-18/9) - (-2.18e-18/4) ) 

Let me calculate that. Let's factor out 2.18e-18:

delta E = 2.18e-18 [ (-1/9) + (1/4) ] = 2.18e-18 [ ( -4 + 9 ) / 36 ] = 2.18e-18 * (5/36) 

Wait, 5/36 is approximately 0.1389. So delta E ≈ 2.18e-18 * 0.1389 ≈ 3.03e-19 J.

Looking at the options, I see option A is 1.55e-19, which is smaller than what I got. Option E is 3.03e-19, which matches my calculation. But wait, let me double-check the formula.

Wait, another thought: sometimes the Rydberg formula is written as 1/lambda = R*(1/2² -1/3²), but that's for wavelength. But the question is about energy. Hmm, but for energy, the change is delta E = E_3 - E_2. Or wait, maybe I have the levels backwards. Because when the electron is in a higher energy level (n=3) and drops to n=2, the energy emitted is E_3 - E_2. Wait, no, because E_3 is higher than E_2 (since E_n becomes more negative as n decreases). So E_3 is -2.18e-18/9, which is approximately -0.242e-18 J. E_2 is -2.18e-18/4 = -0.545e-18 J. So the difference is E_3 - E_2 is (-0.242) - (-0.545) ) = 0.303e-18 J, which is 3.03e-19 J. So that matches option A? Wait, no. Option A is 1.55e-19. Option E is 3.03e-19. Oh, wait, no, 0.303e-18 is 3.03e-19 J. So E is 3.03e-19, which is option E.

Wait, but looking back, let me check the options again. Option B is 3.03e-19 multiplied by [1/3² - 1/4²], which is (1/9 - 1/16) = (16-9)/(144) = 7/144 ≈ 0.0486. So 3.03e-19 * 0.0486 would be smaller. No, that's not right. Because in the calculation, delta E is 2.18e-18 * (5/36) = 3.03e-19 J.

Looking at the options, option E is exactly 3.03e-19 J. So that's the answer. Alternatively, option D is 2.18e-18 times [1/2² - 1/3²], which is (1/4 -1/9) = (5/36). So 2.18e-18 * 5/36 is 3.03e-19, same as option E.

Wait, no. Let's compute option D: 2.18e-18 * (1/4 -1/9) = 2.18e-18 * (5/36) = (2.18 *5)/(36) )e-18 → 10.9 /36 = approx 0.303e-18 = 3.03e-19 J. So option D also gives 3.03e-19 J.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option D: 2.18 ×10^-18 × [1/(2^2) - 1/(3^2)] → 2.18e-18 * (5/36) = 3.03e-19 J.

Option E is 3.03e-19 J.

So why are there two options that give the same result? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait the question is about the quantum of energy, which is the energy of the emitted photon. So the correct answer is 3.03e-19 J, which is option E or option D's calculation.

But looking again, option D is 2.18e-18 multiplied by (1/4 - 1/9) which gives the correct value. So why is option E exactly that value?

So perhaps option D is the expression, and option E is the calculated value. The question is asking for the magnitude of the quantum of energy, so they want the value, which is 3.03e-19 J. So option E is correct.

Wait, but I thought the energy levels are E_n = -R_H * hc / n², where R_H is the Rydberg constant. Oh wait, sometimes the energy is given as E_n = - (e^2)/(8ε₀ a₀) * 1/n², but that's another approach. Alternatively, using the Rydberg constant, the energy can be written as E_n = -R_H * h * c / n².

But the point is, the change in energy is delta E = E_3 - E_2 = R_H (1/(2²) - 1/(3²)).

Wait, no, because E_n is negative. So E_3 = - R_H / 9, E_2 = - R_H /4. So delta E is E_3 - E_2 = (-R_H/9 ) - (-R_H/4) ) = R_H ( -1/9 +1/4 ) = R_H (5/36). So the energy of the photon is R_H * h c * (5/36) ?

Wait, no, wait. Let me get the constants straight. The Rydberg constant R_H is about 1.097e7 m⁻¹. But the energy can be calculated as delta E = h c R_H (1/(n_final²) - 1/(n_initial²)).

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The standard formula for the energy emitted when an electron transitions from n_i to n_f (n_f < n_i) is:

Energy = R_H * h * c * (1/(n_f²) - 1/(n_i²)).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Or is it the other way around? Because when n_f is smaller than n_i, the term (1/n_f² -1/n_i²) would be positive, and since energy is emitted, the photon's energy would be positive.

Wait, another approach: The Rydberg formula for wavelength is 1/lambda = R*(1/(n_final)^2 -1/(n_initial)^2). But since lambda is in the denominator, a positive result implies emission.

So in this case, n_initial is 3, n_final is 2. So 1/lambda = R*(1/2² -1/3²) → positive, so emission.

The energy E is hc/lambda, so E = hc * Rydberg * (1/4 -1/9).

But wait, the Rydberg constant R is already (1/(n²)) terms, but in terms of inverse meters. So to get energy, E = h c R (1/4 -1/9).

Hmmm, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's get back to the energy levels.

The energy levels are E_n = - (13.6 eV) / n². So in joules, 13.6 eV is approximately 2.18e-18 J as I thought earlier.

So E_3 = -2.18e-18 J /9 = approximately -0.242e-18 J.

E_2 = -2.18e-18 J /4 = -0.545e-18 J.

So delta E (photon energy) is E_3 - E_2 = (-0.242e-18) - (-0.545e-18) ) = 0.303e-18 J = 3.03e-19 J. So that's option E.

So looking back at the options, option E is exactly 3.03e-19 J. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but let's check the options again. Option D is 2.18e-18 multiplied by (1/2^2 - 1/3^2). Let's compute that: (1/4 -1/9) = 5/36 ≈ 0.1389. So 2.18e-18 * 0.1389 = approx 0.303e-18 = 3.03e-19. So option D gives the same numerical value as option E. But option E is that number, 3.03e-19.

So what's the difference between the options? Option D is an expression that evaluates to the same number, but option E is just the number. The question asks for the magnitude of the quantum of energy. So both options D and E have the same numerical value, but the way they're written differs.

Wait, but looking back, the options are:

E: 3.03 × 10^-19 joule

D: 2.18 × 10^-18 joule × [1/(2^2) - 1/(3^2)]

So why are there two options with the same numerical value? Because when you compute option D, you get the same as option E.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, 2.18e-18 * (1/4 -1/9) → 2.18e-18 * (5/36) → (2.18 *5) =10.9 → 10.9 /36 ≈ 0.303 → 0.303e-18 = 3.03e-19 J.

Yes, so option D is the expression, which equals 3.03e-19 J, which is option E.

But the question is asking for the magnitude of the quantum of energy. So the correct answer is option E, which is 3.03e-19 J.

So the correct answer should be E.

To determine the quantum of energy emitted when an electron transitions from \( n = 3 \) to \( n = 2 \), we use the energy level formula for hydrogen:

\[
E_n = -\frac{2.18 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}}{n^2}
\]

The energy difference between the two levels is:

\[
\Delta E = E_3 - E_2 = -\frac{2.18 \times 10^{-18}}{3^2} - \left(-\frac{2.18 \times 10^{-18}}{2^2}\right)
\]

Factoring out \( 2.18 \times 10^{-18} \):

\[
\Delta E = 2.18 \times 10^{-18} \left( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{9} \right)
\]

Simplify the terms inside the parentheses:

\[
\frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{9} = \frac{9}{36} - \frac{4}{36} = \frac{5}{36}
\]

Thus:

\[
\Delta E = 2.18 \times 10^{-18} \times \frac{5}{36} = 3.03 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
\]

This matches the value given in option E. Option D also represents the same calculation but in a different form, where the numerical value evaluates to \( 3.03 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \). Since the question asks for the magnitude of the quantum of energy, the correct answer is the numerical value, which is option E.
