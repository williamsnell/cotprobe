Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So, Vale is a 50% partner in Ball Partnership. I remember that in partnerships, each partner's share of income is based on their ownership percentage. So, since Vale owns 50%, he'll get half of the partnership's income.

The question is about what gets included in Vale's adjusted gross income (AGI). Let's look at the details given.

Ball Partnership's tax return shows two items: tax-exempt interest income of $80,000 and dividend income of $12,000. Hmm, tax-exempt interest... wait, isn't that not taxable? Because if it's tax-exempt, the partners don't have to include it in their taxable income. So, that $80,000 would be excluded from AGI. 

Dividend income, on the other hand, might be taxable. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Partnerships can have different types of income. So, the tax-exempt income passes through to the partners but isn't included in their taxable income. Dividends are a bit tricky because they might be considered separately. But wait, in a partnership, if the partnership receives dividends, those are passed through to the partners as dividend income, which would be reported on their personal returns. But for AGI, I think dividend income is included because AGI includes all income except specific exclusions. Wait, no, AGI is gross income minus certain deductions. So, does dividend income count as gross income? I think it does. 

So, the partnership has $80,000 of tax-exempt interest and $12,000 of dividend income. So the total income would be $92,000. But since the tax-exempt interest isn't included in gross income, only the dividend income is. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Partnerships pass through various types of income. Tax-exempt interest is indeed not taxable, so it's excluded from the partner's taxable income. But Dividend income received by the partnership would be considered as dividend income to the partners. 

Wait, but wait. Partnerships are pass-through entities, so the items of income are passed through to the partners. So, tax-exempt interest would pass through as tax-exempt to the partners. So, each partner's share would be 50% of each item.

So, tax-exempt interest: $80k * 50% = $40k. This is excluded from AGI.

Dividend income: $12k *50% = $6k. Dividends are generally included in gross income but subject to certain exclusions or lower tax rates. But for AGI purposes, I think dividend income is included as gross income. Because AGI is calculated before itemized deductions and certain exemptions. So, yes, this $6k would be part of Vale's AGI.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is asking about the total amount of gross income from Ball Partnership to be included in Vale's AGI. So, tax-exempt interest isn't included, but other items are.

Wait, the problem also mentions a cash distribution. Oh, right, on December 31, Ball made a $10,000 nonliquidating cash distribution to each partner. Since each partner gets $10k, and there are two partners, total distribution is $20k. But the question is about the income to include, not the distribution's effect on basis. So, nonliquidating distributions generally reduce the partner's basis but don't count as income. So, this distribution doesn't affect the income included in AGI.

So, the only income items are the tax-exempt interest and dividends. Since tax-exempt interest isn't included, only the $6k from dividends is included in AGI. But wait, the options don't have $6k as the answer. Wait, looking at the options, option J is $6,000, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything.

Wait, maybe I missed other items. Oh, wait, the partnership might have other income. Let me reread the problem. Oh, in the tax return, it only reports tax-exempt interest of $80k and dividend income of $12k. So, that's the only income. So, for each partner, their share is 50% of each.

Wait, but wait another point. Partnerships can have different types of income that affect the partners differently. Tax-exempt interest is excluded, but what about other income? For example, if the partnership had ordinary business income, that would be included. But in this case, the only items are tax-exempt and dividends.

So, the only thing that counts towards AGI is the $6k in dividends. So, the total gross income from Ball would be $6k. Looking at the options, that's option J.

But wait, let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps the question is about the total gross income, not the taxable income. So, does tax-exempt income count as gross income? Because tax-exempt interest is excluded from gross income. So, the tax-exempt interest wouldn't be part of gross income. So, only the dividend income, which is $12k in total, 50% to each partner, so $6k. So, that's the amount to include.

So, the answer should be $6,000, which is option J.

Vale is a 50% partner in Ball Partnership, and the question asks how much of the partnership's income should be included in Vale's year 1 adjusted gross income (AGI). The partnership's tax return reports two items: $80,000 of tax-exempt interest income and $12,000 of dividend income. 

1. **Tax-Exempt Interest Income**: Tax-exempt interest is not included in gross income and, therefore, is excluded from AGI. Vale's 50% share of this income is $40,000, but it does not contribute to AGI.

2. **Dividend Income**: Dividend income is included in gross income and, consequently, in AGI. Vale's 50% share of the $12,000 dividend income is $6,000, which must be included in AGI.

3. **Nonliquidating Cash Distribution**: The $10,000 nonliquidating cash distribution to each partner does not affect AGI, as such distributions reduce the partner's tax basis in the partnership but are not considered income.

Thus, the only amount of gross income from Ball Partnership that should be included in Vale's AGI is the $6,000 share of dividend income.

The correct answer is **J: $6,000**.
