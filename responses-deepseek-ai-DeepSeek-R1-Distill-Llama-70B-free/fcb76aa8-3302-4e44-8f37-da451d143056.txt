Okay, so I have this equation to solve: x plus 71 equals negative 22. Hmm, I think I remember that to solve for x, I need to isolate it on one side of the equation. So, the equation is x + 71 = -22. 

Wait, right, the goal is to get x by itself. Since 71 is being added to x, I should subtract 71 from both sides to undo that. Let me write that down. If I subtract 71 from both sides, it would look like x + 71 -71 = -22 -71. 

Simplifying the left side, the +71 and -71 cancel out, so I'm left with x equals... well, I need to calculate what's on the right side. So -22 minus 71. Let me think, 22 plus 70 is 92, so 22 plus 71 is 93. But since both are negative, it's -93. So x equals -93.

Wait, let me double-check that math. If I have negative 22 and subtract 71, that's like starting at -22 and moving 71 units to the left on the number line. So yes, that would be -22 -71 = -(22+71) = -93. So x is -93. 

Looking at the options, option I is -93. So the answer should be I. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes I get mixed up with the signs. So if x is -93, then plugging back into the original equation: -93 +71 equals -22. Let's see, 93 minus 71 is 22, so with the negative, it's -22, which matches the equation. Yep, that's correct.

The equation to solve is \( x + 71 = -22 \). To isolate \( x \), subtract 71 from both sides:

\[
x + 71 - 71 = -22 - 71
\]

Simplifying:

\[
x = -93
\]

Thus, the solution is \( x = -93 \), which corresponds to option I.
