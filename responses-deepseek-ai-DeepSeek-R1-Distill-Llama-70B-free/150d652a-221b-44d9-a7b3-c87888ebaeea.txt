Question:

What components of the plasma can affect the blood pressure? Explain how they affect it. What other solutes are present in the plasma?

Options:

A: The concentration of inorganic salts has no effect on blood pressure.
B: The presence of white blood cells is the main determinant of blood pressure.
C: Only red blood cells affect the blood pressure.
D: Only the concentration of oxygen and carbon dioxide in plasma affects blood pressure.
E: Plasma proteins have no influence on blood pressure; plasma is primarily composed of vitamins and minerals.
F: The viscosity of plasma, unrelated to its solute content, is the sole factor influencing blood pressure.
G: Plasma contains only water and no solutes.
H: The concentrations of inorganic salts and plasma proteins can affect the blood pressure. Plasma also contains organic nutrients, nitrogenous waste products, hormones and dissolved gases.
I: Blood pressure is unaffected by plasma composition; plasma contains only immune system factors.
J: The concentration of glucose in plasma is the only factor affecting blood pressure.

Okay, I have this question about blood pressure and plasma components. I'm a bit rusty on my physiology, but let's try to break it down.

The question is asking which components of the plasma affect blood pressure and how. Then, it also asks about other solutes present in the plasma. The options are from A to J.

First, I remember that blood pressure is influenced by several factors, including blood volume and the viscosity of blood. Blood is made up of plasma and the formed elements like red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Plasma itself is mostly water, but it carries a lot of solutes.

So, what's in plasma? I think plasma contains proteins, like albumin, globulins, and fibrinogen. These proteins are produced mainly by the liver. Plasma proteins can't easily pass through blood vessel walls, which helps maintain the osmotic pressure needed for blood volume. If the concentration of these proteins changes, it can affect how much fluid stays in the blood vessels, thus influencing blood pressure.

Then there are the inorganic saltsâ€”like sodium, potassium, chloride ions. These ions contribute to the osmolarity of the plasma. Sodium, especially, plays a big role in blood pressure regulation. High sodium can increase blood volume because the body retains water to dilute the sodium, which can raise blood pressure. So, the concentration of these salts definitely affects blood pressure.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A says inorganic salts have no effect. That's wrong because I just thought about how sodium affects blood pressure.

Option B says white blood cells determine blood pressure. I don't think so. White blood cells are part of the immune system; their main role isn't in blood pressure regulation.

Option C says only red blood cells affect it. Red blood cells do contribute to blood viscosity, which is a factor. But plasma components also play a role, so this is incorrect.

Option D mentions only oxygen and carbon dioxide. That's probably not right because those gases affect respiration and acid-base balance but aren't the main drivers of blood pressure.

Option E claims plasma proteins don't influence blood pressure and that plasma is mainly vitamins and minerals. That's wrong on both counts. Plasma proteins do influence blood pressure via osmotic effects, and plasma contains more than just vitamins and minerals.

Option F says viscosity is the only factor, unrelated to solute content. No, solute concentration affects osmotic pressure and blood volume, which in turn affects blood pressure, so this is incorrect.

Option G says plasma has only water. No, that's not right because plasma has many solutes, as I thought earlier.

Option H states that inorganic salts and plasma proteins affect blood pressure, and plasma also has organic nutrients, waste, hormones, and gases. This sounds correct. Plasma carries glucose, amino acids (organic nutrients), urea (waste), various hormones like insulin, and gases like O2 and CO2 dissolved.

Option I says blood pressure isn't affected by plasma, which is wrong. Also, plasma contains more than just immune factors.

Option J says only glucose affects blood pressure. That's not correct because glucose levels affect other things, like insulin, but blood pressure is influenced by more factors than just glucose.

So, putting it all together, option H seems to be the correct answer. It correctly identifies the components that affect blood pressure and lists other solutes present in plasma.

The correct answer is:

H: The concentrations of inorganic salts and plasma proteins can affect the blood pressure. Plasma also contains organic nutrients, nitrogenous waste products, hormones and dissolved gases.

This option accurately identifies that inorganic salts (like sodium and potassium ions) and plasma proteins influence blood pressure through osmotic and volumetric effects. Additionally, it correctly lists other solutes in plasma, such as organic nutrients (e.g., glucose, amino acids), nitrogenous waste products (e.g., urea), hormones (e.g., insulin), and dissolved gases (e.g., oxygen, carbon dioxide).

Answer: H
