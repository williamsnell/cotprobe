Question:

Why is a moss plant restricted to a height of less thanabout 15 cm?

Options:

A: Moss plants do not grow tall because they have a slow growth rate
B: Moss plants are limited in height because they have shallow root systems that cannot support taller structures
C: Moss plants are restricted to a short stature due to their preference for low light conditions
D: Moss plants are restricted to a height of less than 15 cm due to their genetic makeup
E: Moss plants can't grow tall because they are afraid of heights
F: Moss plants are short due to lack of sunlight
G: Moss plants are short because they rely on water diffusion for nutrient transport, which is less efficient over longer distances
H: Due to the inefficiency of the rhizoids in absorbing water and minerals, the absence of True vascular and supporting tissues, and the need for fertilization to occur in a moist environment.
I: The height of moss plants is limited by their inability to produce wood
J: Mosses remain small because they are outcompeted for resources by taller plants

Okay, so I have this question about why mosses don't grow taller than about 15 cm. I'm a bit rusty on my botany, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that mosses are non-vascular plants, which means they don't have a true vascular system like trees or flowers. Vascular tissues include xylem and phloem, which are important for transporting water, nutrients, and sugars throughout the plant. Without these, the plant's ability to move resources might be limited.

So, if mosses don't have vascular tissues, how do they get water and nutrients? I think they absorb water and nutrients directly through their leaves or stems, maybe using structures like rhizoids, which are kind of like roots but not the same. Rhizoids probably aren't as efficient as true roots because they don't have the same structure or function.

Since water and nutrients are absorbed through diffusion, which isn't very efficient over long distances, taller plants would have a harder time getting what they need. Imagine water having to travel up a long stem without a good transport systemâ€”it would be tough, right? So the lack of vascular tissues would definitely limit how tall a moss can grow.

Another point I remember is that mosses need moisture for fertilization. They reproduce via spores, and the sperm needs water to reach the egg. So they tend to grow in damp environments. If they were taller, maybe they'd dry out too much, but I'm not sure if that's the main reason for the height limit.

Looking at the options:

Option H says it's due to the inefficiency of rhizoids, absence of vascular tissues, and the need for moist fertilization. That sounds comprehensive and covers the main points I was thinking about.

Option B talks about shallow roots, but mosses don't have true roots, so maybe that's part of it, but not the whole story.

Option G mentions water diffusion inefficiency, which is part of it, but maybe not the whole reason. H includes more factors.

So, putting it all together, the main reasons are the lack of vascular tissues, inefficient rhizoids, and the need for a moist environment for reproduction. So the correct answer should be H.

The moss plant's height is restricted to less than 15 cm primarily due to its lack of vascular tissues, which limits efficient water and nutrient transport over longer distances. Additionally, mosses rely on rhizoids for absorption, which are less efficient than true roots, and they require a moist environment for fertilization. These factors collectively constrain their growth.

Answer: H
