Okay, so I have this question about construction terms, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what the question is asking. It says that plates are the horizontal structures at the top and bottom of a wall. Then, the question is asking which of the options are the vertical structures. Hmm, I remember that in wall construction, there are various components, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

Wait, so plates are horizontal. I think plates in walls are like the top plate and bottom plate. They run along the top and bottom of the wall, right? So they're part of the framing. Now, the vertical parts would be the things that stand up between these plates. Oh right, those are usually called studs. Studs are the vertical wooden beams that make up the frame of the wall. They connect the top and bottom plates.

Looking at the options, option A is Studs. So that's probably the correct answer. Let me think about the other options to make sure I'm not mixing things up. Sheathing is the material that covers the studs, like plywood or oriented strand board (OSB), so that's not vertical. Rafters are part of the roof, they're the sloped beams. Beams are horizontal supports, like in the ceiling or floor. Trusses are pre-made frames for roofs, which have both horizontal and angled parts but aren't the vertical wall parts. Girders are large beams, usually supporting other structures, so horizontal again. Sill plates are at the bottom of walls, sitting on the foundation, so they're horizontal. Headers are beams placed over openings like doors and windows, so horizontal too. Purlins are part of the roof structure, running parallel to the rafters. Joists are the horizontal beams in the floor or ceiling.

So, the only vertical structures in the options are the studs. So the answer should be A.

The vertical structures in a wall are the studs, which connect the top and bottom plates.
