Question:

A baseball fan purchased two tickets for a World Series baseball game. The fan contacted his best friend and invited him to go to the game. The friend, who was a fanatic baseball fan, eagerly agreed. The fan told the friend that the game started at 7:00 p. m. and that he would pick him up at about 5:00 p. m. so they could get there early to watch batting practice. They were driving to the game together when the fan sped up to cross an intersection while the traffic signal was changing from amber to red. As he reached the intersection, the fan was traveling at 50 m. p. h. although the posted speed limit was 25 m. p. h. Simultaneously, a car entered the intersection on red and collided with the fan's vehicle. The friend suffered a broken pelvis in the collision. This jurisdiction has adopted the following "modified" comparative negligence statute:"A negligent plaintiff is entitled to obtain a recovery provided plaintiff's negligence is not equal to or greater than that of the defendant's; otherwise no recovery is permitted. "Suppose the friend brings suit against the driver of the car that entered the intersection on the red light to recover damages for his injury. Ajury returned a special verdict with the following findings: (1) The fan was 55 percent negligent in speeding; (2) The driver was 45 percent negligent in driving through the red light; and (3) The friend suffered $100,000 in damages. As a result, the court should enter a judgment for the friend in the amount of

Options:

A: $45,000. 00
B: $50,000.00
C: nothing, because the fan was more negligentthan the driver.
D: A split judgment where the fan pays $55,000.00 and the driver pays $45,000.00
E: $100,000.00 but paid by both the fan and the driver
F: $45,000.00 but only from the driver's insurance
G: $55,000. 00
H: $55,000.00 but only from the fan's insurance
I: $55,000.00 from the driver as the fan was more negligent
J: $100,000. 00

Okay, so I have this question about tort law, specifically comparative negligence. Hmm, I remember that comparative negligence is a doctrine that affects how damages are awarded when both the plaintiff and the defendant are at fault.

The scenario is about a car accident. A fan and his friend were going to a baseball game. The fan was speeding, going 50 in a 25 zone, and another car ran a red light, causing a collision. The friend was injured and is suing the driver of the other car.

The jurisdiction has a modified comparative negligence statute. The wording says that a negligent plaintiff can recover if their negligence isn't equal to or greater than the defendant's. So if the plaintiff is 50% or more at fault, they can't recover. But if they're less than that, they can.

The jury's findings: fan was 55% negligent, driver 45%. Wait, wait, but the friend is the plaintiff here, right? So the friend is the plaintiff, suing the driver. But the fan is the plaintiff's friend, so the friend's own negligence would come into play if he were the one being sued, but here, the friend is suing the driver. Wait, no, wait. Or does the friend's negligence matter?

Wait, no, wait a second. The friend is the plaintiff, so the question is whether the friend was negligent. Because in this case, the friend was a passenger, right? So the fan was driving negligently. But the friend, as a passenger, is he considered negligent? Hmm, I think that depends. Because the friend might have known that the fan was speeding and didn't object, but that's maybe negligible. But in this case, the jury apportioned 55% to the fan (the driver) and 45% to the driver of the other car.

Wait, but the question is the friend suing the driver of the other car. So the plaintiff is the friend, and the defendant is the other driver. So the plaintiff's own negligence is the fan's? Or is the friend considered without fault because he's a passenger?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Because the friend is the passenger, and the fan is the driver. So the friend's negligence, if any, would be in getting into the car with a driver who was speeding. But I don't think that's considered here because the jury's finding is about the fan's negligence and the driver's.

Wait, the question says the jury found the fan 55% negligent and the driver 45%. So from the friend's perspective, the friend's own negligence isn't part of this. Or wait, no. Because the friend is the plaintiff, the defendant (other driver) might argue that the friend was contributorily negligent by, say, not wearing a seatbelt or getting into a car with a speeding driver.

But in this case, the jury's apportionment is between the fan (55%) and the driver (45%). So the friend, as the plaintiff, is not found to be negligent. Because the negligence is between the two drivers. So the friend is suing the driver, and the driver's negligence is 45%, the fan's is 55%. But the friend isn't at fault.

Wait, but the statute says that a negligent plaintiff can't recover if their negligence is equal to or greater than the defendant. But if the friend isn't negligent at all, then he can recover fully, minus any contributory negligence. But in this case, the fan is the one who was driving negligently, but the friend is the passenger. So the friend isn't negligent.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try again. The friend is suing the driver. The driver's negligence is 45%, the fan's is 55%. But the friend isn't at fault, so the only issue is whether the driver is liable.

Wait, but under joint and several liability, each defendant can be held responsible for the entire damages, but I don't think that's in play here since the question is about the friend's recovery against the driver.

Wait, the question is about the friend's recovery against the driver, so the driver's negligence is 45%. The total damages are $100,000. So the driver is 45% responsible, so the friend should recover 45% of the damages from the driver. But wait, the modified comparative negligence says that if the plaintiff's negligence is equal to or greater, no recovery. But the friend isn't negligent. So the friend can recover the full amount from the driver, but the driver's liability is limited to their percentage of fault.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because in a pure comparative negligence state, the plaintiff's recovery is reduced by their percentage of fault. But in a modified system, if the plaintiff is more than 50% at fault, they can't recover. But if they're less, they can recover the difference.

But in this case, the friend isn't at fault. So his recovery isn't reduced. So he can recover the full $100,000 from the driver. But wait, the driver's negligence is 45%, so maybe the driver is only responsible for 45% of the damages. Or is it that the total negligence is 100%, so the driver is 45% liable, and the fan is 55% liable, but the fan isn't a defendant here.

Wait, the friend is suing only the driver, not the fan. So the driver is 45% at fault. So the driver is liable for 45% of the damages, which is $45,000. Because the fan isn't a party to the lawsuit, the driver can't seek contribution from the fan, but the friend can only recover from the driver what the driver is liable for.

Wait, but under joint and several liability, the driver could be held responsible for the entire amount, but I don't think the question is considering that. The question seems to present a simple case where each defendant is only liable for their portion.

But I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let's approach it step by step.

1. Jurisdiction: Modified comparative negligence. Plaintiff recovers if their negligence is less than defendant's. So if plaintiff is 50% or more, no recovery. Less than 50%, they can recover the difference.

2. The friend is the plaintiff. The defendant is the driver.

3. The jury found: fan (driver of the car the friend was in) 55% negligent; driver (defendant) 45% negligent.

But wait, the friend is the passenger. So the friend's own negligence, if any, would be considered. But in the scenario, the friend didn't do anything wrong. He was just a passenger. Unless getting into a car with a speeding driver is considered contributory negligence, but that's a stretch and not typically how it's applied.

However, the jury's finding is about the fan and the driver. The friend's negligence isn't mentioned. So perhaps the friend isn't negligent at all. So the plaintiff's (friend's) negligence is zero. So under the modified comparative negligence, since the friend is 0% negligent, and the driver is 45%, the friend can recover.

But wait, the statute says "a negligent plaintiff". If the plaintiff is not negligent at all, then the statute doesn't apply, and the plaintiff can recover fully from the defendant.

Wait, but the fan's negligence is being considered here. Because the fan is the driver, and the friend is the passenger. So the fan's negligence would be imputed to the friend? Or is that only in specific situations, like family members or if the passenger was in a business relationship?

I think that in some cases, the driver's negligence can be imputed to the passenger if they're in a joint enterprise, like if they're going to commit a crime together or something. But in this case, they're just going to a baseball game. So the fan's negligence wouldn't be imputed to the friend.

Therefore, the friend's negligence is zero. So the driver is 45% at fault, and the fan is 55% at fault, but the fan isn't a defendant. So the friend can recover 45% of the damages from the driver.

Wait, but the total damages are $100,000. So 45% of that is $45,000.

Looking at the options, option A is $45,000. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but another angle: if the jurisdiction allows for joint and several liability, the defendant could be held responsible for the entire $100,000, but that's not how the question is framed. The question is about the friend's recovery against the driver, so it's limited to the driver's percentage of fault, which is 45%. So $45,000.

Alternatively, if the jurisdiction applies the plaintiff's recovery as the total minus plaintiff's percentage, but since the friend isn't at fault, he gets the full $100,000. But that doesn't make sense because the driver is only 45% at fault. So the friend can't recover more than the driver's share.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the rules. In some states, each defendant is only liable for their percentage of fault. So if the driver is 45% at fault, he's liable for 45% of the damages. So the friend would get $45,000 from the driver, and the fan (if sued) would be liable for 55%, but the friend isn't suing the fan, so he can't get that from him.

So the correct answer is A: $45,000.

But wait, another thought: the fan's negligence (55%)—could that affect the friend's recovery? Because the fan is the plaintiff's driver. So if the fan is 55% at fault, and the driver 45%, but the friend isn't at fault, then the friend can recover the full amount from the driver. But the driver's liability is only 45%, so the friend can recover 45% of the damages, which is $45,000.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer is A.

The question involves a car accident where the friend, as the plaintiff, is suing the driver of the other car for damages. The jurisdiction follows a modified comparative negligence statute, which bars recovery for a negligent plaintiff if their negligence is equal to or greater than the defendant's. 

Key facts from the scenario:
1. The jury found the fan (the driver of the car the friend was in) 55% negligent for speeding.
2. The driver of the other car was found 45% negligent for running the red light.
3. The friend suffered $100,000 in damages.

The friend, as the plaintiff, is not found to be negligent. The fan's negligence (55%) does not affect the friend's recovery because the fan is not a defendant in this case. The driver's negligence (45%) is the only relevant factor in determining liability.

Under the modified comparative negligence statute, since the friend is not negligent, they can recover damages from the driver. However, the driver is only liable for their proportionate share of the negligence, which is 45% of the total damages. Therefore, the friend is entitled to recover $45,000 from the driver.

The correct answer is **A: $45,000.00**.
