Question:

An investor owned a building in a city. This was the only piece of real estate that the investor owned. The three-story building had a store on the ground floor and apartments on the other two floors. The investor entered into a leasehold agreement with a tenant, who would lease the first floor, where she planned to open a sporting goods store. After identifying the parties, the operative words of the lease were as follows: "Landlord hereby agrees to lease for the three years the first floor of his building in the city to tenant, reserving unto said landlord annual rental in the sum of $12,000 payable in advance in monthly installments of $1,000. "After the tenant took possession and the investor accepted her rent payment for the first floor of the building, which of the following most accurately describes the legal relationship between the parties?

Options:

A: A joint tenancy was created.
B: The tenant became the freeholder of the property.
C: The tenant's equitable three-year term became a legal three-year term.
D: The tenant became a subtenant of the investor.
E: A tenancy at sufferance was created.
F: A periodic tenancy from month-to-month was created.
G: The tenant's three-year term became a periodic tenancy.
H: A tenancy at will was created.
I: A periodic tenancy from year-to-year was created.

Okay, so I've got this real estate question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The scenario is about an investor who owns a building. The building has three stories: a store on the ground floor and apartments on the other two. The investor leased the first floor to a tenant who wants to open a sporting goods store. The lease agreement says it's for three years, with an annual rent of $12,000, paid monthly in advance at $1,000 each month. After the tenant took possession and the investor accepted the first rent payment, the question is about the legal relationship between them.

The options are A to I, each describing a different legal relationship. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, let me recall what I know about lease agreements and types of tenancies. I remember that when a lease is for a fixed term, like three years, it's usually called a tenancy for years. The key here is that the lease has a specific start and end date. So if the lease is for three years, that's a tenancy for years, not a periodic tenancy which renews automatically.

But wait, the question asks what's the legal relationship after the tenant took possession and the investor accepted rent. Does that change anything? Hmm. So the lease was agreed upon, and now it's active.

Looking at the options:

Option C says the tenant's equitable three-year term became a legal three-year term. I'm not exactly sure what "equitable" means here. Maybe it refers to equity in the sense of fairness, but in property law, an equitable interest can sometimes mean a beneficial interest, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it refers to the concept of a lease versus a license, but I'm not sure.

Option I is a periodic tenancy from year-to-year. That would happen if there wasn't a fixed term, and the lease just renews each year. But the lease here is for three years, so I don't think that's it.

Option F is a month-to-month periodic tenancy. That would be the case if the lease was month-to-month, but here it's a three-year term.

Option A is joint tenancy. That's about co-ownership, which isn't the case here. The investor is the owner, and the tenant is leasing, so they're not co-owning.

Option B says the tenant became the freeholder. No, the investor is still the owner. The tenant has a lease, not ownership.

Option D: tenant became a subtenant. That would require the investor to be a tenant themselves, but the investor is the landlord, so that's not it.

Option E: tenancy at sufferance. That's when a tenant stays without permission, which isn't the case here because the investor agreed to the lease.

Option G: three-year term becomes periodic. No, the term is fixed, so it shouldn't be periodic.

Option H: tenancy at will. That's when the lease can be terminated by either party at any time, but this lease is for a fixed three years, so it's not at will.

So, going back to option C. The lease was for three years. When the tenant takes possession and starts paying, the lease becomes a legal term. Wait, but isn't a lease for years a legal term from the start? Or does the concept of equitable vs. legal come into play here?

I think that when a lease is created, it's a legal estate. But maybe before the tenant takes possession, it's an equitable interest, and upon taking possession, it becomes a legal estate. Or perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts. 

Wait, in property law, a lease is a legal estate. So when the lease is created, the tenant gets a leasehold estate, which is a legal interest. So if the lease is for three years, it's a tenancy for years. So the relationship is a tenancy for years, but none of the options directly say that. Wait, looking at the options again.

Wait, the options don't have a tenancy for years as an option. So I need to see which option best fits. Let me review the options again.

Option C says the tenant's equitable three-year term became a legal three-year term. So maybe before taking possession, the tenant had an equitable interest, like an agreement to lease, and upon taking possession and paying rent, it becomes a legal lease. That makes sense because an agreement to lease (like an option) is an equitable interest, and when the lease is executed, it becomes a legal estate.

So in this case, once the lease is executed, with the tenant taking possession and paying rent, the legal relationship is that the tenant holds a legal lease for three years. So option C would be correct.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because the lease was already agreed upon. The wording says the lease was entered into, so perhaps the lease was already a legal term. Unless the initial agreement was an equitable one, like an option, and then when they execute the lease, it becomes legal.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial agreement (before possession) was an equitable lease, and upon taking possession, it's a legal lease. So option C is saying that the tenant's equitable term became legal.

Alternatively, maybe the lease itself is a legal term from the start. But I'm trying to match the options given.

Another approach: the lease is for three years, which creates a tenancy for years. So the legal relationship is a tenancy for years. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is C, because it refers to the three-year term being legal.

Wait, let me think about the options again. The question is about the legal relationship after the tenant took possession and rent was accepted. So the key point is that the lease is now in effect, creating a tenancy for years.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Tenant's equitable three-year term became a legal three-year term. So this suggests that prior to possession, the tenant had an equitable (perhaps an agreement), and now it's a legal term.

Alternatively, perhaps the lease is always a legal term once it's signed. So maybe option C is correct because it's stating that the term is now legally recognized.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that a tenancy for years was created, but that's not an option. So the closest option is C.

Wait, another thought. The question says the lease was for three years, so that's a fixed term. So the legal relationship is a tenancy for years, which is a type of leasehold estate. So the correct answer would be that the tenant has a tenancy for years. But none of the options explicitly say that. So perhaps I need to re-examine the options.

Looking again:

Option C says the tenant's equitable three-year term became a legal three-year term. So it's about the type of interest changing from equitable to legal. That would make sense because when you have a contract to lease, it's an equitable interest, but once the lease is executed, it's a legal estate. So when the parties enter into the lease, and the tenant takes possession, the equitable interest (like under a contract) becomes a legal leasehold estate.

So the correct answer is C.

The question revolves around determining the legal relationship between an investor (landlord) and a tenant after the tenant took possession of the first floor of a building and the investor accepted the first rent payment. The lease agreement specifies a three-year term with an annual rent of $12,000, paid in monthly installments of $1,000. The key is to analyze the nature of the tenancy created by this agreement.

First, it is important to recognize that a lease for a fixed term, such as three years, typically creates a "tenancy for years." This type of tenancy has a specific start and end date and is considered a legal estate. However, the options provided do not explicitly mention "tenancy for years," so the analysis must focus on the closest applicable option.

Option A (joint tenancy) is incorrect because the investor and tenant are not co-owners of the property. Option B (tenant became the freeholder) is also incorrect because the investor retains ownership, and the tenant only has a leasehold interest. Option D (tenant became a subtenant) is incorrect because there is no indication that the investor is a tenant themselves. Option E (tenancy at sufferance) is incorrect because the tenant is in lawful possession with the investor's consent. Option F (periodic tenancy from month-to-month) and Option G (three-year term becoming periodic) are incorrect because the lease specifies a fixed three-year term, not a periodic arrangement. Option H (tenancy at will) is incorrect because the lease has a fixed duration and is not terminable at will by either party. Option I (periodic tenancy from year-to-year) is incorrect because the lease is for a fixed three-year term, not a year-to-year arrangement.

This leaves Option C, which states that "the tenant's equitable three-year term became a legal three-year term." This option aligns with the idea that before taking possession and paying rent, the tenant may have had an equitable interest (e.g., under a contract or agreement to lease). Once the lease is executed, the tenant's interest becomes a legal leasehold estate. Therefore, Option C accurately describes the legal relationship after the tenant took possession and the investor accepted rent.

**Answer: C**
