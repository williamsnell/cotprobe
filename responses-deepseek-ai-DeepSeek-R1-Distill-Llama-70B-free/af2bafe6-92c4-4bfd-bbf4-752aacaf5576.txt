Question:

A buyer filed a lawsuit against a seller based on a written contract allegedly executed at the time of the sale of the seller's hot dog stand to the buyer. Under the terms of the contract, the seller agreed not to open a hot dog stand for a period of two years within a distance of two miles of the old hot dog stand, now owned by the buyer. The buyer alleged in his complaint that the seller violated the contract by opening a hot dog stand one-half mile from the old location. The original contract was lost prior to trial. At trial, the buyer wants to introduce a duplicate carbon copy of the written contract. The seller objects as to the authenticity of the original written contract. The copy is

Options:

A: admissible, because the original contract was lost.
B: inadmissible, unless the seller admits to the authenticity of the duplicate.
C: inadmissible, because the seller did not sign or acknowledge the duplicate.
D: inadmissible, because the best evidence rule requires that the original contract always be used as evidence.
E: admissible, because the duplicate is a carbon copy.
F: inadmissible, because the duplicate might be a forgery.
G: admissible, only if the buyer can provide witnesses to confirm the authenticity of the duplicate.
H: admissible, if the court can confirm the fairness of the contract.
I: admissible, because the duplicate has the same legal value as the original contract.
J: inadmissible, because the seller contests the authenticity of the written contract.

Okay, so I have this question about evidence law, specifically dealing with the admissibility of a duplicate document when the original is lost. Hmm, I need to think through this step by step.

The scenario is that a buyer sued a seller for breach of contract. The contract was a written one, and the seller had agreed not to open another hot dog stand within two miles for two years. But the buyer says the seller violated this by opening one half a mile away. Now, the original contract was lost before the trial, and the buyer wants to introduce a duplicate carbon copy. The seller objects, questioning the authenticity of the original.

So the question is whether the duplicate is admissible. The options are A through J, each giving different reasons.

I remember that the best evidence rule generally requires the original document to be produced if the terms of the writing are in issue. But there are exceptions when the original is lost or destroyed. I think under FRE 1004, if a party proves that the original was lost or destroyed, then a copy can be admitted. But wait, is there more to it?

Wait, so the best evidence rule is in play here because the contract's terms are in dispute. The buyer is trying to prove the terms of the contract, so they would normally need the original. But since the original is lost, they can use a copy if certain conditions are met.

I think the key here is whether the duplicate is admissible when the original is lost, and what the requirements are for admitting the duplicate. FRE 1002 is the best evidence rule, which says you need the original unless reasons are shown why it's unavailable. Then, under FRE 1004, there are several reasons for unavailability, such as loss or destruction, and if so, a copy can be used.

But wait, what about authentication? The seller is objecting as to the authenticity of the original. So the question is whether the duplicate is properly authenticated. The duplicate carbon copy would be a copy made at the time of the original, right? So under FRE 901, the buyer needs to authenticate the duplicate. How is that done? Maybe by testifying that it's a true copy, or perhaps the method of duplication (like a carbon copy) is sufficient.

I think that when a document is a carbon copy, and if the original was lost, but the copy is shown to have been made in the regular course of business or at the time of the transaction, it can be authenticated. So the duplicate would be admissible as a substitute under the best evidence rule once the loss is established.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's admissible because the original was lost. That might be correct if the loss makes the copy admissible under the exception.

Option B says inadmissible unless the seller admits to the duplicate's authenticity. But I don't think both parties' agreement is necessary. The buyer can testify that the copy is accurate.

Option C says inadmissible because the seller didn't sign the duplicate. But the duplicate is a copy of the original which was signed. The issue is about the original's existence, not the duplicate's signatures. So maybe C is wrong.

Option D says the best evidence rule requires the original. But that's not right because the best evidence rule allows for copies when the original is lost, so D is incorrect.

Option E says admissible because it's a carbon copy. Well, it's not just being a carbon copy that makes it admissible; it's about the original being lost and the copy being authenticated.

Option F suggests inadmissible because it might be a forgery. But the possibility of forgery goes to the weight of the evidence, not admissibility. The objection here is about authenticity, which is a matter for the court to decide, but under FRE, if the copy is properly authenticated, it's admissible.

Option G says admissible only if witnesses confirm the duplicate's authenticity. I think that's not necessary if the duplicate can be authenticated through other means, like the method of reproduction.

Option I says the duplicate has the same legal value as the original. That doesn't sound right because the original is preferred, but when it's lost, the duplicate is allowed as a substitute.

Option J says inadmissible because the seller contests authenticity. But the seller's objection goes to the weight, not admissibility. If the buyer can lay a foundation, like testifying it's a true copy, the duplicate should be admissible.

So putting it together, the correct answer is probably A, because the original was lost, making the duplicate admissible under the exception to the best evidence rule.

Wait, but I thought earlier that more conditions might apply, like proper authentication. So maybe option E is correct because it's a carbon copy. Or perhaps it's A because the original was lost, satisfying the exception.

Wait, the best evidence rule requires that to prove the content of a writing, the original is needed unless reasons are shown. Here, the original is lost, so under FRE 1004, a copy can be used if it's shown that the original is lost. So the buyer needs to establish that the original was lost, and then the duplicate can be admitted.

But the seller is objecting to the authenticity of the original. So if the buyer can't prove that the original existed, then the duplicate's admissibility is in question. Alternatively, the duplicate's admissibility would require the buyer to authenticate it as a true copy of the original.

Hmm, so maybe the issue is whether the duplicate is properly authenticated. Under FRE 901, the duplicate needs to be authenticated as a true copy. The fact that it's a carbon copy made at the time suggests it's a reliable copy, but the seller's objection about the original's authenticity might require the buyer to provide evidence that the original existed and that the duplicate is a true copy.

Alternatively, perhaps the duplicate itself can be admitted if the original is lost, and the buyer can testify that it's a true copy. So the duplicate is admissible under the best evidence exception, and the seller's objection goes to weight, not admissibility.

So I think the correct answer is A: admissible because the original was lost. Because the loss makes the original unavailable, and the duplicate can be substituted under FRE 1004, provided the proper foundation is laid about the loss and the duplicate being a copy.

Wait, but do we know if the buyer provided evidence of the loss? The question states that the original was lost prior to trial. So perhaps the buyer can testify that the original was lost, which would be sufficient under FRE 1004(a)(1), which allows for a copy if the original was lost or destroyed without bad faith.

So the answer should be A.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a duplicate carbon copy of a written contract under the best evidence rule when the original has been lost. The buyer seeks to introduce the duplicate to prove the terms of the contract, but the seller objects, contesting the authenticity of the original.

Under the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE), the best evidence rule (FRE 1002) generally requires the original document to prove the content of a writing. However, exceptions apply when the original is lost or destroyed. Specifically, FRE 1004 allows the use of a copy if the original is unavailable, provided the proponent can establish that the original was lost or destroyed without bad faith. In this case, the original contract was lost before trial, which satisfies the condition for using a substitute.

The duplicate carbon copy is admissible because it qualifies as a substitute under the exception to the best evidence rule. The fact that the seller contests the authenticity of the original does not render the duplicate inadmissible; such objections go to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility. The buyer can authenticate the duplicate by testifying that it is a true and accurate copy of the original, which is sufficient under FRE 901.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Correct. The duplicate is admissible because the original was lost, satisfying the exception to the best evidence rule.
- **B**: Incorrect. The seller's admission is not required for the duplicate to be admissible.
- **C**: Incorrect. The duplicate does not need the seller's signature since it is a copy of the original, which was presumably signed.
- **D**: Incorrect. The best evidence rule does not require the original if it is lost or destroyed.
- **E**: Incorrect. While the duplicate is a carbon copy, its admissibility depends on the original being lost, not merely its format.
- **F**: Incorrect. The possibility of forgery affects the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.
- **G**: Incorrect. Witnesses are not strictly necessary if the duplicate can be authenticated through other means, such as the buyer's testimony.
- **I**: Incorrect. The duplicate does not have the same legal value as the original, but it is admissible as a substitute when the original is lost.
- **J**: Incorrect. The seller's objection to authenticity does not bar admissibility; it only affects the weight of the evidence.

The correct answer is **A**, as the duplicate is admissible under the exception to the best evidence rule due to the loss of the original.

**Answer: A**
