Okay, I have this multiple-choice question about factors impacting moral intensity. Hmm, I remember that moral intensity refers to how strongly an issue is perceived as ethical or moral. So the question is asking which three factors influence that.

Looking at the options, each option has three terms. I think the factors are part of Jones' Moral Intensity Model. From what I recall, Jones proposed several factors that determine the moral intensity of an issue in decision making. Let me try to list those factors.

I think the factors are: social consensus, proximity, magnitude of consequences, temporal immediacy, and concentration of effect. Wait, but the question only asks for three factors, so maybe it's the first three or some combination.

Wait, the options given include terms like social consensus, temporal immediacy, proximity, social dissensus, etc. So I need to pick the right combination.

Let me think again. Jones' model includes six factors, but perhaps the question is focusing on three of them. The options given in the choices are combinations of three terms each.

Looking at the options:

Option B: Social consensus, Temporal immediacy, Proximity. That sounds familiar. Social consensus refers to the degree of agreement about what is right or wrong. Temporal immediacy is about how soon the consequences of the action will occur. Proximity is how close the issue is to the individual, either physically or emotionally.

Option A has Social dissensus, which is the opposite of consensus. So that's probably not right because high social consensus makes moral intensity higher.

Option G: Cultural consensus, Temporal immediacy, Proximity. But I'm not sure if it's cultural or social consensus. I think it's social, so B might be better.

Wait, another factor I remember is proximity, which is definitely in the model. So option B has that.

Putting it together, the factors are social consensus, temporal immediacy, and proximity. So the correct answer should be option B.

The question asks which three factors can impact moral intensity. Based on Jones' Moral Intensity Model, the relevant factors include social consensus, temporal immediacy, and proximity. Social consensus refers to societal agreement on ethical issues, temporal immediacy concerns the timing of consequences, and proximity relates to how close the issue is to the individual. Option B correctly lists these factors.

Answer: B
