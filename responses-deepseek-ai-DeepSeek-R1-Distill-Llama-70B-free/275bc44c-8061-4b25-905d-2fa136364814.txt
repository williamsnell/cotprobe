Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with dynamics, but let's give it a shot. Let me read it again.

Alright, so there's a 10 kg box sliding without friction at 1 m/s. Then a constant force is applied in the direction of motion. The box travels 5 meters while this force is applied. Then the force is removed, and the box's speed becomes 2 m/s. I need to find the magnitude of the applied force. The options are A to J, with various Newtons.

Hmm. So I think I should break this down into two parts: the motion while the force is applied, and then the motion after the force is removed. Wait, but after the force is removed, the box's speed is given, so maybe I can work backwards.

Wait, when the force is applied, it's a constant force, so the box is under acceleration. Then when the force is removed, it's moving at 2 m/s. So I need to find the force that caused the box to accelerate from 1 m/s to some higher speed, but only over a distance of 5 meters. Hmm, but wait, the force is applied for a certain distance, not time. So perhaps I should use the work-energy principle.

Oh right, work done by the force will change the kinetic energy. Because when the force is applied, work is done, increasing the kinetic energy. Then, when the force is removed, the box has a new speed.

Wait, let me outline the steps:

1. The box starts with an initial velocity, u1 = 1 m/s.
2. A force F is applied, causing acceleration a.
3. The box travels a distance s = 5 m under this force.
4. After that, the force is removed, and the box's speed is now v1 = 2 m/s.

Wait, but how do I connect these? Because the force is applied over 5 meters, so perhaps I can calculate the work done by the force, which is F*s, and that would equal the change in kinetic energy.

But wait, the work done by the force F is F*s, yes. The initial kinetic energy is (1/2) m u1², and after moving 5m, the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v². So the work done is the change in KE.

But wait, what's the velocity after the force is applied? Because the final velocity when the force is removed is 2 m/s. Wait, no—the force is applied when the box is moving, then after moving 5m, the force is removed, and the speed becomes 2 m/s. So that 2 m/s is after the force was applied for 5m. So that means during the 5m, the box accelerated from 1 m/s to some higher speed, and then after the force is removed, it's moving at 2 m/s. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if the force is removed, the box would continue moving with constant velocity. So perhaps when the force is applied, the box accelerates, moving 5m, and upon reaching that point, the force stops, and the box's speed is 2 m/s. So the final velocity after the force is applied is 2 m/s.

Wait, the problem says: "the force is then removed, leaving the box with a speed of 2 m/s." So that must mean that after the force was applied for 5m, the speed is 2 m/s. So during the 5m, the box went from 1 m/s to 2 m/s. Hmm, but that seems a small change. Alternatively, perhaps the 5m is the distance during which the force was applied, and after that, the speed is 2 m/s.

Wait, perhaps the initial speed is 1 m/s, then a force is applied, causing acceleration over a distance of 5m, and after that, the force is removed, and the box continues moving at a constant speed of 2 m/s. So the speed after the force was applied is 2 m/s.

So the work done by the force equals the change in kinetic energy.

So initial KE: (1/2) * 10 kg * (1)^2 = 5 J.

Final KE after force is applied: (1/2) * 10 * (2)^2 = 20 J.

So the change in KE is 15 J. Therefore, the work done by the force is 15 J.

But wait, work done is F * d, where d is 5 m. So F = work / d = 15 J /5 m = 3 N.

Wait, but 3 N is option J. Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm missing something. Because when the force is applied, it's causing acceleration, but I'm assuming the work done is F*s. But wait, if F is applied in the direction of motion, then the displacement is in that direction, so the work done is positive.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use kinematics equations. Let me think about that approach as a check.

So, initial velocity u = 1 m/s, final velocity v = 2 m/s, distance s =5m.

Using the equation: v² = u² + 2 a s.

So 2² = 1² + 2a*5.

4 =1 +10a → 10a=3 → a=0.3 m/s².

Then F = m a = 10 kg * 0.3 =3 N. So that's the same as before. So this gives 3 N, which is option J.

Wait, but that seems low, considering the box is speeding up over a distance. Let me double-check the calculations.

Kinetic energy approach:

Initial KE: 0.5 *10*1 =5 J.

After 5m, KE is 0.5 *10 * (2)^2= 20 J.

Change is 15 J. Work done is F*5 =15 → F=3 N. Yep, same result.

So the answer should be J:3 N.

But wait, let me think again. Because if the force was applied over 5m, and the speed increased to 2 m/s, which is only 1 m/s increase. Then, the acceleration is a= (v² -u²)/(2s) → (4-1)/(10)= 0.3 m/s². So F= ma= 3N. So the answer is J.

To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the box in two stages: during the application of the constant force and after the force is removed. The key is to use the work-energy principle and kinematic equations to determine the applied force.

### Stage 1: Motion under the constant force
- The box starts with an initial velocity \( u_1 = 1 \, \text{m/s} \).
- A constant force \( F \) is applied, causing the box to accelerate.
- The box travels a distance \( s = 5 \, \text{m} \) under this force.
- After the force is removed, the box's speed is \( v_1 = 2 \, \text{m/s} \).

Using the work-energy principle:
- The work done by the force \( F \) is equal to the change in kinetic energy.
- Initial kinetic energy: \( KE_{\text{initial}} = \frac{1}{2} m u_1^2 = \frac{1}{2} (10) (1)^2 = 5 \, \text{J} \).
- Final kinetic energy: \( KE_{\text{final}} = \frac{1}{2} m v_1^2 = \frac{1}{2} (10) (2)^2 = 20 \, \text{J} \).
- Change in kinetic energy: \( \Delta KE = KE_{\text{final}} - KE_{\text{initial}} = 20 - 5 = 15 \, \text{J} \).

The work done by the force is \( W = F \cdot s \). Setting \( W = \Delta KE \):
\[
F \cdot 5 = 15 \implies F = \frac{15}{5} = 3 \, \text{N}.
\]

### Verification using kinematics
Using the kinematic equation \( v^2 = u^2 + 2as \):
- \( v = 2 \, \text{m/s}, \, u = 1 \, \text{m/s}, \, s = 5 \, \text{m} \).
\[
2^2 = 1^2 + 2a(5) \implies 4 = 1 + 10a \implies 10a = 3 \implies a = 0.3 \, \text{m/s}^2.
\]
The force is then calculated using \( F = ma \):
\[
F = 10 \cdot 0.3 = 3 \, \text{N}.
\]

### Conclusion
Both the work-energy principle and kinematic equations confirm that the applied force is \( 3 \, \text{N} \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**J**
