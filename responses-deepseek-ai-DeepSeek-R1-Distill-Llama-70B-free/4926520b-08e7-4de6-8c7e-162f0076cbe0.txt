Question:

A man is the owner of record of a parcel of land designated as "A. " It is the highest of three neighboring properties on a mountain. The man's friend is the owner of parcel "B," which is situated lower than "A" on the mountainside. The man's cousin owns parcel "C," which lies below parcels "A" and "B" on the mountain slope. In 2000, the man who originally owned all three parcels of land constructed a private drainage system. This system consisted of an underground pipeline that extended across all three parcels of land. Sewage from parcel "A" drained through the system to a municipal sewer, which was located at the bottom of the mountain. In 2005, the man sold parcel "B" to his friend. The following year, the cousin purchased parcel "C" from the man. The deeds to the friend and the cousin did not contain any mention of the man's drainage system. Located on each of the parcels are large ranch-style homes occupied by the respective owners. From the standpoint of the friend and the cousin, thedrainage system would most likely be defined as a(an)

Options:

A: easement by necessity.
B: profit à prendre.

Okay, so I have this question about easements, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me start by recalling what I know about easements. Easements are rights to use another person's land for a specific purpose. They can be categorized in different ways, like easement by necessity, easement by implication, appurtenant, in gross, and so on.

The question describes three parcels of land, A, B, and C, arranged on a mountain slope. The man owns A, his friend owns B, and his cousin owns C. Originally, the man owned all three parcels and built a private drainage system in 2000. This system is an underground pipeline that goes across all three parcels. Sewage from A drains through this system to a municipal sewer at the bottom of the mountain.

In 2005, the man sold parcel B to his friend, and the next year, he sold parcel C to his cousin. The deeds to B and C didn't mention the drainage system. Now, the question is asking from the friend and cousin's standpoint, how would the drainage system be defined.

So, I need to determine what type of easement this is. Let me think about the different types.

An easement by necessity typically arises when a parcel of land is landlocked and needs access. It's based on necessity, like having no other way out. But here, the drainage system was built before the parcels were sold, so maybe it's not about necessity now.

Easement by implication is when the easement isn't explicitly stated in the deed but is implied based on the circumstances when the property was divided. Like, if the original owner had a common use that would continue after the sale, like a shared driveway or, in this case, a drainage system.

Easement appurtenant is when the easement benefits a particular piece of land (the dominant estate) and burdens another (the servient estate). It requires two parcels: dominant and servient. Here, the drainage system benefits parcel A, which is higher up, by allowing it to drain sewage down through B and C to the municipal sewer. So, the easement would run with the land, benefiting A as the dominant estate, and burdening B and C as servient.

Express easement would require that the easement is explicitly stated in the deed. But in this case, the deeds to B and C didn't mention it, so it's not an express easement.

Easement in gross benefits a person rather than a parcel of land. Like utility easements, which can be held by companies. But here, the system is for the benefit of the land (parcel A), so it's more likely appurtenant.

Profit à prendre is the right to take something from the land, like minerals or timber, which doesn't fit here.

License is revocable and doesn't create a property interest, so that's not it.

Equitable servitude is more about enforceable agreements in equity, like covenants, but the question is about easements, so probably not the right category.

Natural easement, or easement by natural right, I think refers to something based on the natural situation, like water flow. But I'm not too sure about this one.

Prescriptive easement is obtained through adverse use over time, but here the system was built by the original owner, so it's not something that someone else took over time.

So, putting it together. The drainage system was built while the man owned all three parcels. When he sold B and C, the deeds didn't mention it. But the system was already in place, serving parcel A by allowing drainage. This seems like an easement by implication because it was in existence at the time of the sale, and it's necessary for the use of parcel A.

Wait, but I thought it might be appurtenant. Because it's an easement that benefits one parcel (A) and burdens the others (B and C). So appurtenant easements require that the easement exists to benefit the dominant estate.

Another point: easement by implication is often based on a quasi-easement. So when the original owner had all the parcels, the drainage system was serving parcel A, which was part of the same ownership. Then, when the parcels are sold, the easement is implied because it was already being used.

So, in this case, the easement would be appurtenant because it benefits parcel A and burdens B and C. So the answer would be H: easement appurtenant.

Wait, but the question is from the friend and cousin's perspective. They are the owners of B and C, which are the servient estates. So the easement exists for the benefit of A, so it's appurtenant.

Alternatively, easement by implication comes into play when the original property is divided, and the easement is necessary for the reasonable use of the property. Since the drainage system was built before the sales, it's implied that the easement continues.

Hmm, so perhaps the easement was created by implication when the parcels were sold. Because the original owner had a drainage system that was apparently serving A, and upon selling B and C, the easement would be implied to continue.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to break it down.

Easement by implication occurs when:

1. The original property was under common ownership.
2. There was an apparent and continuous use of a quasi-easement during that ownership.
3. The easement is necessary for the reasonable use of the land.

In this case, the drainage system was built while the man owned all three parcels. So when he sold B and C, the easement would be implied because it's necessary for the use of A.

So from the friend and cousin's standpoint, the system would be an easement by implication because it was in place before the sale, and they took the land subject to that existing easement.

Wait, but I thought appurtenant easements are those that attach to land, so when the land is transferred, the easement goes with it. So if the system was built to serve A, then when A is sold, the easement would continue. But in this case, A is still owned by the man, and B and C were sold. So the easement is appurtenant to A, burdening B and C.

Wait, so the friend and cousin own B and C, which are burdened by the easement. So the easement is appurtenant because it benefits A. So the answer would be H: easement appurtenant.

But then again, since the easement was in place at the time of sale, it's implied that the new owners (B and C) are subject to it. So the easement exists by implication.

I'm a bit torn between C (easement by implication) and H (easement appurtenant).

Another point: easement by implication doesn't require the two parcels to have been under common ownership at the time of the easement's creation. Wait, no, I think easement by implication does require that the easement was created when the land was under common ownership.

So in this case, when the man sold B and C, the easement would have been implied because it was already in use.

So the answer would be C: easement by implication.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The easement appurtenant is a type of easement, whereas easement by implication is a way the easement is created.

So the system would be an easement appurtenant because it benefits A and burdens B and C. But the method of creation is by implication because it wasn't expressed in the deed.

Alternatively, the question is asking how the drainage system would be defined from the friend and cousin's standpoint. So they own the servient estates, and the easement is appurtenant, as it's attached to the dominant estate (A).

So perhaps the correct answer is H.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to recall more clearly.

Easement by implication is created when a tract is divided, and the easement is necessary for the use of the land. So, when the man sold B and C, the fact that the drainage system was already there for A implies that the easement continues.

So from B and C's perspective, the drainage system is an easement that was created by implication when they bought the land. So the answer would be C.

Alternatively, since the easement appurtenant is about the relationship between dominant and servient estates, perhaps it's H.

Wait, another way to think: the easement was created when the land was divided, so it's an easement by implication. But it's also appurtenant because it benefits a parcel of land.

So the easement's type is appurtenant, but it was created by implication.

The question asks what it would be defined as. So the type is easement appurtenant. So the answer is H.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Maybe I should look up the elements again.

Easement by implication requires that at the time of the division, the easement was apparent, continuous, and necessary. Here, the system was built before the sales, so it was in place. When the man sold B and C, the easement would be implied because it's necessary for A's use (without the drainage, A might not function properly). So the easement exists by implication.

But in terms of the type of easement, it's appurtenant because it benefits a specific parcel (A) and burdens B and C.

So perhaps the easement is both created by implication and is appurtenant. But the question is asking for the definition from the friend and cousin's perspective. So they own the land that the easement burdens. The easement is appurtenant because it's attached to A.

Wait, but the options are separate. So the choices are between types like appurtenant, by implication, etc.

So the correct answer is H: easement appurtenant.

Alternatively, because the easement was created without being mentioned in the deed, it's by implication, so the answer would be C.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of a similar example. Imagine a shared driveway that was built before the land was divided. When the land is sold, the easement is implied. So it's an easement by implication. But that easement is appurtenant because it benefits the dominant estate.

So in the question, the drainage system was built before the sale, so it's by implication. But the type is appurtenant.

Wait, but the question is asking what it's defined as from the friend and cousin's standpoint. So they're the ones burdened by the easement. So the easement is appurtenant, meaning it's attached to another parcel.

Alternatively, the easement was created by implication, so for them, the easement exists because it was implied at the time of sale.

So perhaps the answer is C: easement by implication.

I'm still not 100% certain, but I think the correct answer is H: easement appurtenant because it's an easement that benefits a specific parcel (A) and burdens others. Alternatively, it's C because it was created by implication when the land was sold.

Wait, but the man still owns A. So the easement is for the benefit of A, so it's appurtenant. The fact that the easement was created by implication when B and C were sold makes it an easement by implication as well.

But the question is about the definition of the drainage system, not how it was created. So the type is appurtenant, so H.

The question involves determining the legal definition of a drainage system on three neighboring parcels of land (A, B, and C) from the perspective of the owners of parcels B and C. The drainage system, built in 2000 by the original owner of all three parcels, allows sewage from parcel A to flow through underground pipes across parcels B and C to a municipal sewer. The deeds to B and C, sold in 2005 and 2006, respectively, did not mention the drainage system. The task is to classify the drainage system as a type of easement.

Key considerations include:

1. **Easement by Necessity**: This arises when a parcel is landlocked and requires access. However, the drainage system was built before the parcels were sold, so necessity does not apply here.

2. **Easement by Implication**: This is created when a tract of land is divided, and the easement is apparent, continuous, and necessary for the reasonable use of the land. The drainage system was in place before the sales of B and C, and it is necessary for the use of parcel A. This suggests that the easement could be implied.

3. **Easement Appurtenant**: This type of easement benefits a dominant estate (parcel A) and burdens a servient estate (parcels B and C). The drainage system benefits parcel A by allowing it to drain sewage, making it an easement appurtenant.

4. **Express Easement**: This requires explicit mention in the deed. Since the deeds to B and C did not mention the drainage system, this is not applicable.

5. **Easement in Gross**: This benefits a person or entity rather than a parcel of land. The drainage system benefits parcel A, so this is not applicable.

6. **Other Types**: Profit à prendre, license, equitable servitude, natural easement, and prescriptive easement do not fit the facts of the case.

The drainage system is necessary for the use of parcel A and was in place before the sales of B and C. This suggests that the easement was created by implication. However, the type of easement is appurtenant because it benefits a specific parcel (A) and burdens others (B and C). Since the question asks for the definition of the drainage system from the perspective of the owners of B and C, the correct classification is **easement appurtenant**.
