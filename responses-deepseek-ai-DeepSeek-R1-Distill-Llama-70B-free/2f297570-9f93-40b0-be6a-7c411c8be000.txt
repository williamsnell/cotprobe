Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. Hmm, Count Rumford and some experiment with heating water using a horse. Interesting. I remember that Rumford's work was related to the idea that heat is a form of motion, right? But the problem is more about calculating the height a horse can raise a weight based on the energy used.

So, the problem gives me some data. Let me jot it down. The horse can heat 11.6 kg of ice water from 273 K to 355 K in 2.5 hours. And the question is, using the same rate of work, how high could the horse raise a 225 kg weight in 2.5 minutes? Oh, and the specific heat capacity of water is given as 4.18 J/(kg·K), I think. Wait, no, wait, in the problem statement, it's written as 4.18 J K^-1 g^-1. Oh right, because it's per gram. So I might need to convert that to per kilogram.

Wait, wait. Specific heat capacity is usually given in J/(kg·K) or J/(g·K). Since the mass here is in kg, I should convert the specific heat to per kg. So 4.18 J/(g·K) is 4180 J/(kg·K), because 1 kg is 1000 g. So 4.18 times 1000 is 4180. Got it.

So first, I think I need to calculate the amount of heat energy the horse provided in the first scenario. Because the power (rate of work) would be the same in both cases. So Power is energy per time.

In the first case, the energy is the heat used to warm the water. The formula for heat is Q = mcΔT. So let me compute that.

Mass m is 11.6 kg. Specific heat c is 4180 J/(kg·K). The temperature change ΔT is 355 K minus 273 K. Let's calculate that: 355-273 = 82 K. So ΔT is 82 K.

So Q = 11.6 kg * 4180 J/kg·K * 82 K. Let me compute that.

Wait, 11.6 * 4180 = let's see, 10 *4180 is 41800, 1.6*4180 is 6,688. So total is 41800 + 6688 = 48488 J. Then multiply by 82? Wait no, wait, no, wait. Because I think I might have messed up the order. Let me correct that. Q is m*c*ΔT. So 11.6 *4180 = 48488 J/K. Then multiply by 82 K gives 48488 *82. Let me compute that.

Hmm, 48488 * 80 is 3,879,040, and 48488 *2 is 96,976. So total is 3,879,040 +96,976 = 3,976,016 J. So approximately 3.976e6 J, or about 3,976,000 J.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check that calculation. Because 11.6 kg *4180 J/kg·K = 11.6 *4180 = let's compute that again.

11 *4180 = 45,980, and 0.6 *4180 = 2,508. So 45,980 +2,508 = 48,488 J/K. Then multiply by 82 K gives 48,488 *82.

So 48,488 *80= 3,879,040 and 48,488 *2=96,976. So sum is 3,976,016 J. Yeah, same as before.

Now, the time taken was 2.5 hours. So the power is energy divided by time. But wait, the time needs to be in seconds if I'm using SI units. Let's convert 2.5 hours to seconds. 1 hour is 3600 seconds, so 2.5 *3600 = 9000 seconds.

Power P = Q / t = 3,976,016 J / 9000 s. Let me compute that. 3,976,016 ÷9000.

Well, 9000 is 9e3. 3,976,016 ÷9 = approx 441,780.666... So 441,780.666... divided by 1000 (since 9e3 is 9000) gives 441.780... W. So approximately 441.78 Watts.

Wait, wait, maybe better to compute it more accurately. 3,976,016 ÷9000. Let's see, 9000 goes into 3,976,016 how many times.

9000 * 441 = 9000 *400=3,600,000. 9000 *41=369,000. So 3,600,000 + 369,000 = 3,969,000. Subtract that from 3,976,016: 3,976,016 -3,969,000= 7016.

So 441 with 7016 remaining. 7016/9000 is approximately 0.78. So P ≈ 441.78 W.

So the power is about 441.78 Watts. Now, in the second scenario, the same power is used, but for 2.5 minutes. I need to find how high the horse can lift a 225 kg weight in that time.

Wait, so the power is the rate of doing work. So in time t, the energy used is P*t. So first, let's find the energy available in 2.5 minutes.

Wait, 2.5 minutes is 150 seconds. So energy E = P * t = 441.78 W * 150 s. Let me compute that.

441.78 *150 = 441.78 *100=44,178, plus 441.78*50=22,089. So total 44,178 +22,089 =66,267 J.

So E is approximately 66,267 J.

Now, the work done to lift the weight is W = mgh, where m is mass, g is gravity, and h is the height. So h = W/(m g).

So m is 225 kg, g is approximately 9.8 m/s². So h = 66,267 J / (225 kg *9.8 m/s²).

Compute the denominator: 225 *9.8 = let's calculate. 200 *9.8=1960, 25 *9.8=245. So 1960+245=2205. So denominator is 2205.

So h = 66,267 / 2205.

Let me compute that. 2205 *30 = 66,150. So 30 meters would be 66,150. The numerator is 66,267, which is 117 more. So 117 /2205 = approximately 0.053. So h ≈30.053 meters.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because 30 m is option A, but I have to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Energy in the first case: Q = 11.6 kg *4180 J/kg·K *82 K.

11.6 *4180 = 48,488 J/K. 48,488 *82 = let's compute 48,488 *80=3,879,040 and 48,488*2=96,976. Sum is 3,976,016 J. Correct.

Time is 2.5 hours = 2.5 *3600=9000 seconds.

Power P=3,976,016 /9000 = 441.78 W. Correct.

In second scenario, time is 2.5 minutes=150 seconds. So energy E=441.78 *150=66,267 J. Correct.

Work done to lift weight: mgh=225 *9.8 *h = 2205 h.

So h=66,267 /2205 = approx 30.05 m. So 30 m is the closest option, which is option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 30 m. So the answer would be A.

Wait, but let me think again. I might have made a mistake in the specific heat calculation. Oh wait, the specific heat given was 4.18 J K^-1 g^-1. So that's 4.18 J per gram per K. So per kg, it's 4.18 *1000 =4180 J/kg·K. So that was correct.

But wait, another thought: in the first scenario, they were heating ice water. Does that imply that some heat is used to melt the ice? Oh wait, no, the initial temp is 273 K, same as ice. And the final is 355 K, so that's liquid water. So the heat is only for raising the temp, no phase change. So the calculation is correct.

Another possible mistake: did I use the right units for g? Yes, 9.8 m/s² is correct.

Wait another thing: the time in the second case is 2.5 minutes. So 2.5 *60=150 seconds, correct.

So all the steps seem correct. So the height is approximately 30 meters, which is option A. But wait, looking back at the options, option A is 30 m. So the correct answer is A.

To solve the problem, we first calculate the heat energy required to warm the water using the formula \( Q = mc\Delta T \). The mass of the water is \( m = 11.6 \, \mathrm{kg} \), the specific heat capacity is \( c = 4180 \, \mathrm{J/(kg \cdot K)} \) (converted from \( 4.18 \, \mathrm{J/(g \cdot K)} \)), and the temperature change is \( \Delta T = 355 \, \mathrm{K} - 273 \, \mathrm{K} = 82 \, \mathrm{K} \). Substituting these values:

\[
Q = 11.6 \cdot 4180 \cdot 82 = 3,976,016 \, \mathrm{J}.
\]

Next, we calculate the power delivered by the horse. The time taken to heat the water is \( t = 2.5 \, \mathrm{hours} = 9000 \, \mathrm{seconds} \). Power is given by \( P = Q / t \):

\[
P = \frac{3,976,016}{9000} \approx 441.78 \, \mathrm{W}.
\]

In the second scenario, the same power is used for \( t = 2.5 \, \mathrm{minutes} = 150 \, \mathrm{seconds} \). The total energy available is:

\[
E = P \cdot t = 441.78 \cdot 150 = 66,267 \, \mathrm{J}.
\]

This energy is used to lift a \( 225 \, \mathrm{kg} \) weight against gravity, where the work done is \( W = mgh \). Solving for the height \( h \):

\[
h = \frac{W}{m \cdot g} = \frac{66,267}{225 \cdot 9.8} = \frac{66,267}{2205} \approx 30.05 \, \mathrm{m}.
\]

Thus, the horse can raise the weight to a height of approximately \( 30 \, \mathrm{m} \). The closest option is:

**A: 30 m**
