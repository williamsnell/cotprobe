Question:

In 1998, a farmer, advancing in age, realizes that he is no longer able to farm his 1,000 acres and therefore decides to sell some of the farmland in parcels of 250 acres. The president of a development company is interested in purchasing three of the four parcels. The president buys the three parcels from the farmer and begins formulating plans for constructing single-family dwelling units on the land. The original deed between the farmer and the development company contains a provision expressly binding "upon all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns," stipulating that any further subdivisions by any such persons shall be restricted to minimum two-acre lots to be used for single- family dwelling units only. The development company immediately subdivided two of the parcels into lots of three, four, and five acres, and began construction of homes thereon. The original deed restrictions were enumerated within the special warranty deeds and were given to the purchasers of the homes in the new development, called phase 1. Two years later, the president sold the remaining parcel, which had not been included in the phase 1 subdivision plan, to a contractor. The contractor, in turn, drafted a subdivision plan for the last 250-acre parcel, dividing it into one-acre lots. The contractor then commenced construction of single-family dwelling units in the new development, to be known as phase 2. There was no mention of the restriction for two-acre minimum lots in the deeds to the purchasers of the new homes in phase 2. Meanwhile, after the farmer's death, his estate isrequired to sell the remaining 250-acre parcel of his farmland. The buyer is an investor, who proposes to construct a two-level shopping center and parking lot on the property. The area surrounding phase 1 and phase 2 was rezoned for commercial and industrial uses in 2010. The investor's shopping center has grown to include 150 stores. Now, one of the lot owners in phase 1 contracts to sell his property to two physicians who plan to start a suburban medical practice. In an action by the homeowners in phase 1 to prevent such commercial use by the physicians, the court will most likely hold that

Options:

A: the restrictions are still enforceable, but only for the original buyers from the development company.
B: the restrictions are not enforceable because the investor was able to construct a shopping center on the remaining farmland.
C: the restrictions would no longer be enforceable, because the offering of personal services (i. e. , medical) would be a conforming use.
D: the restrictions could be enforceable if the court considers the medical practice as a commercial enterprise.
E: the restrictions would no longer be enforceable because the medical practice is considered a necessary service for the community.
F: the restrictions are not enforceable because the surrounding area has been rezoned for commercial and industrial uses.
G: the restrictions are still enforceable, thus preventing such commercial use.
H: the restrictions are not enforceable because they were not mentioned in the deeds to the buyers of phase 2 homes.
I: the restrictions would no longer be enforceable, because of the change in the character of the neighborhood.
J: the restrictions would no longer be enforceable, because the opening of a physician's office in a private home would not be construed as a commercial enterprise.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about real property law, specifically dealing with restrictive covenants. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

The situation is about a farmer selling his land in parcels, and there's a deed restriction involved. Let me try to outline the facts.

In 1998, a farmer sells 750 acres to a development company in three parcels of 250 acres each. The deed includes a restriction that any further subdivisions must be into minimum two-acre lots for single-family homes only. This restriction is supposed to bind all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns. So the development company buys three parcels and starts building phase 1, subdividing two of them into 3,4,5-acre lots. They give the deeds to phase 1 homeowners with the restriction mentioned.

Then, two years later, the president sells the remaining 250-acre parcel (the fourth one) to a contractor, who subdivides it into one-acre lots for phase 2. But the phase 2 deeds don't mention the restriction. 

After the farmer dies, his estate sells the last 250-acre parcel to an investor who builds a shopping center. The surrounding area was rezoned for commercial and industrial in 2010, and the shopping center now has 150 stores.

Now, a phase 1 lot owner wants to sell to two physicians for a medical practice. The phase 1 homeowners are trying to stop this commercial use. The question is about whether the court will enforce the restrictions.

So the options are about whether the restrictions are enforceable against the physicians' commercial use.

I remember that restrictive covenants are promises in a deed that bind the land and future owners. They must meet certain criteria to be enforceable. The key issues here are whether the covenants were properly created, whether they've been violated, and whether any changes in the area affect their enforceability.

First, the original deed from the farmer to the development company includes a restriction that's supposed to bind all subsequent grantees. So when the development company sold the phase 1 properties, the deeds included this restriction. But in phase 2, the deeds didn't mention it. However, the restriction is supposed to run with the land, so maybe it's still enforceable even if not mentioned.

Wait, but for a covenant to run with the land at common law, it needs to meet certain requirements. It must "touch and concern" the land, intention to run, and notice. Here, the restriction is in the original deed, so subsequent purchasers should be bound if they had constructive notice, like if it's recorded.

So phase 1 homeowners have the restriction, phase 2's deeds didn't mention it, but the original deed is recorded. So maybe phase 2 is still bound. But the phase 2 lots were subdivided into one-acre lots, which violates the two-acre minimum. But that's a separate issue from the physicians' use.

Now, the farmer's estate sells the last parcel to an investor who builds a shopping center. The area around phase 1 and 2 was rezoned for commercial and industrial in 2010. So the area is now commercial, which might affect the enforceability of the restrictions.

The main issue is whether the original restriction is still enforceable against the phase 1 lot owner who wants to sell for a medical practice. The physicians' use is commercial, but the restriction was for single-family dwellings only.

There's a concept called "change in the character of the neighborhood," which can affect the enforceability of a restrictive covenant. If the surrounding area has changed significantly, the court might find that enforcing the covenant is no longer equitable.

In this case, the surrounding area was rezoned and is now commercial. The investor built a large shopping center, which suggests that the area has transitioned from residential to commercial. This change might mean that the original restriction no longer serves its purpose, making it unenforceable.

So when the phase 1 homeowners sue to stop the physicians' commercial use, the court would consider whether the neighborhood's character has changed so much that enforcing the restriction isn't feasible anymore.

Looking at the options:

Option I says the restrictions are no longer enforceable because of the change in neighborhood character. That aligns with this reasoning.

Option J suggests that a physician's office in a home isn't commercial, but I think that's incorrect because a medical practice is a commercial activity, even if in a home.

Option C says it's conforming because it's a service, but that doesn't make sense because the restriction is about use type, not the service itself.

So the answer is likely I or J. But J doesn't seem right because a medical office is a commercial use. So I is more likely correct.

The question revolves around the enforceability of restrictive covenants in a changing neighborhood. The original deed included a restriction requiring subdivisions to be no smaller than two-acre lots for single-family homes. This restriction was intended to bind all subsequent grantees. However, the neighborhood has undergone significant changes, including rezoning for commercial and industrial use and the construction of a large shopping center. These changes suggest a shift in the character of the area from residential to commercial.

When evaluating whether the restrictions are enforceable against the physicians' plan to operate a medical practice, courts consider factors such as the original intent of the covenant, whether it "touches and concerns" the land, and whether there have been substantial changes in the neighborhood that render enforcement inequitable. The transformation of the surrounding area into a commercial zone indicates a change in the neighborhood's character, which undermines the purpose of the original restriction. This change likely makes the restriction unenforceable against the physicians' commercial use.

Among the options, the most accurate is that the restrictions are no longer enforceable due to the change in the neighborhood's character.
