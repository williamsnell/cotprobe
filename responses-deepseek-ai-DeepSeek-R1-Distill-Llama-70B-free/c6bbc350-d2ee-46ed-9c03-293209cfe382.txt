Okay, so I've got this electrochemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The reaction given is Cd + 2H+ → Cd²+ + H₂. And I'm told that the ΔG at 25°C is -18.57 kcal per mole for Cd²+. I need to find the cell potential and determine if the reaction is spontaneous as written.

Hmm, I remember that the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) is related to the cell potential (E°) by the equation ΔG° = -nFE°, where F is Faraday's constant and n is the number of moles of electrons transferred. Oh wait, but wait, the units here are in kcal, and I think F is usually in terms of J. Oh right, I need to convert the units.

Wait, the ΔG given is -18.57 kcal per mole. But wait, wait! Is that per mole of reaction as written, or per mole of Cd²+? Because the way the question is phrased, it says "for Cd²+", so maybe it's per mole of Cd²+ ions produced. Let me think. The reaction as written produces one mole of Cd²+ and one mole of H₂ gas. So if the ΔG is given per mole of Cd²+, then when one mole of Cd²+ is formed, the ΔG would be -18.57 kcal. But in the reaction, that's exactly what's happening—so the total ΔG° for the reaction is -18.57 kcal.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify. The standard Gibbs free energy change for the reaction as written is given as -18.57 kcal per mole. So I can take that as ΔG°. So I can use that.

So the equation is ΔG° = -nFE°. I need to find E°, the standard cell potential.

First, let's get all the numbers right. ΔG° is given as -18.57 kcal. I need to convert that into joules because F is 96485 C/mol e⁻. Let me recall that 1 kcal is 4184 J. So:

ΔG° = -18.57 kcal * (4184 J / 1 kcal) = let me calculate that. 18 * 4184 is, um, 18 * 4000 is 72,000, 18 * 184 is 3,312, so total 75312, but since it's 18.57, let's do it accurately.

18.57 * 4184: Let's break it down. 18 *4184 = 75312, 0.57 *4184 = approx 0.5*4184=2092, 0.07*4184=293, so 2092+293=2385. So 75312 + 2385=77697 J. But since it's -18.57, it's -77697 J.

Wait, wait, no—ΔG° is given as -18.57, so the value is negative. So ΔG° = -77697 J.

Now, the equation: ΔG° = -nFE°. I'm solving for E°, so rearranging gives E° = -ΔG° / (nF).

Wait, wait, no: ΔG° = -nFE° → E° = -ΔG° / (nF). But wait, ΔG° is negative, so that would make E° positive. Let's plug in the numbers.

So E° = (- (-77697 J)) / (n * 96485 C/mol).

But wait, what's n, the number of moles of electrons transferred? Let's look at the reaction.

The reaction is Cd → Cd²+ + 2e⁻ (oxidation). So Cd is oxidized, losing two electrons.

On the other side, H+ is being reduced to H₂. The reaction for hydrogen is 2H+ + 2e⁻ → H₂. So each H₂ molecule requires 2 electrons.

Putting it together, the two half-reactions are:

Anode (oxidation): Cd → Cd²+ + 2e⁻
Cathode (reduction): 2H+ + 2e⁻ → H₂

So when you add them, the electrons cancel out. So total electrons transferred (n) is 2 moles. Because each Cd atom releases two electrons, and each H₂ molecule uses two electrons. So n is 2.

So n=2.

Now, plug in the numbers:

E° = (77697 J) / (2 * 96485 C/mol)

Let me compute the denominator first. 2 * 96485 = 192,970 C/mol.

So E° = 77697 / 192970 ≈ Let me compute this.

Dividing both numerator and denominator by 1000: 77.697 / 192.97 ≈ 0.403 V.

Wait, that's approximately 0.403 volts.

Now, about the spontaneity. The cell potential is positive (0.403 V), which means the reaction is spontaneous as written. Because a positive E° indicates a spontaneous process.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one has E° ≈0.403 V and says it's spontaneous.

Looking through the options:

Option F: 0.403V, spontaneous.

Option J: 0.503V, spontaneous.

Wait, wait, no—what's the exact calculation?

Wait, let me recalculate the numbers accurately.

ΔG° = -18.57 kcal/mol = -18.57 * 4184 = let's compute that precisely.

18.57 * 4184:

Compute 18 *4184 = 75312.

0.57 *4184: 0.5 *4184 = 2092, 0.07 *4184 = 293. So 2092+293=2385.

So 75312 + 2385 = 77697 J.

So ΔG° is -77697 J, but in the equation, we have E° = -ΔG°/(nF).

So E° = (77697 J) / (2 * 96485) → let's compute 2*96485=192970.

77697 / 192970 = Let me compute this division.

Let me do it step by step.

192970 * 0.4 = 77188.

So 0.4 gives 77188, which is less than 77697.

The difference is 77697 -77188=509.

So 509 /192970 ≈ 0.002637.

So total E°≈0.4 +0.002637=0.4026 V, approximately 0.403 V.

So E° is approximately 0.403 V, which is positive, so spontaneous.

Now, looking at the options:

Option F is 0.403V, spontaneous.

Option G is 0.603V, spontaneous.

So the correct answer is F.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation for n.

In the reaction, Cd is oxidized, losing 2 electrons. The hydrogen is reduced, gaining 2 electrons. So total electrons transferred is 2. So n=2.

Yes, that's correct.

Another point to check: the sign of ΔG and E. Since ΔG° is negative, the reaction is spontaneous, and E° is positive. So yes, the reaction is spontaneous.

So the correct option is F: 0.403 V, spontaneous.

To calculate the cell potential (E°) for the reaction Cd + 2H⁺ → Cd²⁺ + H₂, we use the relationship between Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) and cell potential:

\[
\Delta G^\circ = -nFE^\circ
\]

Here:
- ΔG° = -18.57 kcal/mol (given). Converting to joules:  
  \[
  \Delta G^\circ = -18.57 \, \text{kcal/mol} \times 4184 \, \text{J/kcal} = -77697 \, \text{J/mol}
  \]
- \( n \) = number of moles of electrons transferred. From the reaction:
  - Cd is oxidized: Cd → Cd²⁺ + 2e⁻ (loses 2 electrons).  
  - H⁺ is reduced: 2H⁺ + 2e⁻ → H₂ (gains 2 electrons).  
  Thus, \( n = 2 \).
- \( F \) = Faraday's constant = 96485 C/mol.

Rearranging the equation to solve for \( E^\circ \):
\[
E^\circ = -\frac{\Delta G^\circ}{nF}
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
E^\circ = -\frac{-77697 \, \text{J/mol}}{2 \times 96485 \, \text{C/mol}} = \frac{77697}{192970} \approx 0.403 \, \text{V}
\]

The calculated cell potential is approximately \( 0.403 \, \text{V} \), which is positive. A positive cell potential indicates that the reaction is spontaneous as written.

Now, comparing with the options:
- Option F: \( 0.403 \, \text{V}, \text{spontaneous} \) matches the calculated value and the conclusion about spontaneity.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**F: 0.403V, spontaneous**
