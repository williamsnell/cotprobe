Okay, so I've got this problem here: (6^83 + 8^83) mod 49. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my modular arithmetic, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with exponents in modular arithmetic, Euler's theorem or Fermat's little theorem might come in handy. Wait, Fermat's applies when the modulus is prime, but 49 is 7 squared, so not a prime. Oh right, Euler's theorem is more general. Euler's theorem says that if a and n are coprime, then a^φ(n) ≡ 1 mod n, where φ is Euler's totient function.

So what's φ(49)? Well, since 49 is 7², φ(49) = 49 * (1 - 1/7) = 42. So φ(49) is 42. That means for any number a that's coprime with 49, a^42 ≡ 1 mod 49.

Now, looking at 6 and 49: 6 and 49 are coprime because the factors of 49 are 7 and 1, and 6 is 2*3. So 6^42 ≡ 1 mod 49. Similarly, 8 and 49 are coprime as well because 8 is 2^3. So 8^42 ≡ 1 mod 49.

So the exponents here are 83 for both 6 and 8. Let's break down 83 in terms of multiples of 42.

83 divided by 42 is 1 with a remainder of 41. So 83 = 2*42 - 1? Wait, wait, 42*2 is 84, which is more than 83. So 83 = 42*1 + 41. So 83 mod 42 is 41. Hmm, wait, no. Because 42*1=42, 83-42=41, so the remainder is 41.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should have used 83 mod φ(49) which is 42. So 83 mod 42 is 41 because 42*2=84 which is larger than 83, so subtract 42 once: 83-42=41. So the exponent 83 is equivalent to 41 mod 42. So 6^83 mod 49 is the same as 6^41 mod 49, and similarly for 8^83.

So now we have to compute 6^41 mod49 and 8^41 mod49, then add them together and take mod49.

Hmm, computing 6^41 mod49... that's a bit of a pain. Maybe there's a pattern or a smarter way. Let me think about powers of 6 modulo49.

Wait, another approach: Maybe using Euler's theorem, but 83 is a large exponent. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that 6 and 8 are both small numbers and their powers modulo49 might have a cycle shorter than 42.

Wait, but 42 is the maximum possible cycle length, but sometimes it's shorter. Let me check the order of 6 modulo49. The order is the smallest positive integer k where 6^k ≡1 mod49. Similarly for 8.

But maybe that's too time-consuming. Alternatively, I can try to compute 6^83 mod49 and 8^83 mod49 using exponentiation by squaring or looking for patterns.

Alternatively, maybe using binomial theorem since 6 is close to 7, which is the base of 49. Wait, 6 is 7-1. So 6 = 7-1. So 6^83 = (7-1)^83. Expanding this using the binomial theorem, each term will have a factor of 7^k. So when we take mod49, which is 7^2, any term with 7^2 or higher powers will be zero mod49.

So (7 - 1)^83 = sum_{k=0}^83 C(83,k) *7^k * (-1)^(83 -k). When considering mod49, only the terms where k is 0 or 1 will survive, because 7^2 is 49, which is 0 mod49.

So the expansion mod49 is C(83,0)*7^0*(-1)^83 + C(83,1)*7^1*(-1)^(82).

Compute each part:

C(83,0) = 1, 7^0=1, (-1)^83 = -1. So first term is 1*1*(-1) = -1.

Second term: C(83,1)=83, 7^1=7, (-1)^82=1. So 83*7*1= 581.

So sum is (-1) + 581 = 580 mod49.

Now compute 580 mod49. 49*11=539. 580-539=41. So 580 mod49 is 41.

Wait, but wait a second, that gives me 6^83 mod49 is 41? Because (7-1)^83 mod49 is 41.

Wait, let me check that again. So 6^83 is (7-1)^83. Using the binomial expansion up to the 7^1 term:

Sum is (-1)^83 + 83*7*(-1)^82.

Wait wait, I think I made a mistake in the signs. Let me correct that.

(7 - 1)^83 = sum_{k=0}^83 C(83,k) (7)^k (-1)^(83 -k). So each term is C(83,k) *7^k * (-1)^(83-k).

When k=0: C(83,0)*7^0*(-1)^83 = 1*1*(-1)^83 = -1.

When k=1: C(83,1)*7^1*(-1)^(82) = 83*7*1 = 581.

So sum is (-1) + 581 = 580. 580 mod49: 49*11=539, 580-539=41, so 41 mod49 is 41. So 6^83 mod49 is 41.

Wait, wait, but I think I might have a mistake here because 41 is larger than 49, but wait 41 is less than 49, so that's okay. So 6^83 mod49 is 41.

Now, let's compute 8^83 mod49. Hmm, 8 is 7+1. So 8 =7+1. So 8^83 = (7+1)^83. Again, using the binomial theorem, mod49, any term with 7^2 or higher is zero.

So (7+1)^83 = sum_{k=0}^83 C(83,k) 7^k (1)^(83 -k). Mod49, only k=0 and k=1 terms survive.

So sum is C(83,0)*7^0*1^83 + C(83,1)*7^1*1^82.

Compute each term:

k=0: 1*1*1=1.

k=1: 83*7*1=581.

So sum is 1 + 581 = 582. Now 582 mod49: 49*11=539, 582-539=43. So 43 mod49 is 43.

Wait, but wait, 582/49: 49*11=539, 582-539=43. So yes, 43.

Wait, wait, but let me confirm. 49*12=588, which is larger than 582. So 11*49=539, 582-539=43. So yes, 43.

So 8^83 mod49 is 43.

Now, adding 6^83 mod49 and 8^83 mod49 together: 41 +43 =84. Then 84 mod49 is 84 - 49=35. Because 49*1=49, 84-49=35, which is less than 49. So 35 mod49 is 35.

Wait, but wait, let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake.

So 6^83 mod49 is 41, 8^83 mod49 is 43. Adding them gives 84, which is 35 mod49. So the answer would be 35, which is option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations for 8^83. Because 8 is 7+1, so (7+1)^83. So when k=0, it's 1. When k=1, it's 83*7=581. So sum is 1 + 581=582. 582 mod49 is 43. That seems correct.

And for 6^83, same approach, (7-1)^83, which gives -1 + 83*7= 580. 580 mod49 is 41.

Adding 41 and 43: 84. 84 mod49 is 35. So the result is 35.

Looking at the options, option C is 35. So the answer should be C.

To solve \( (6^{83} + 8^{83}) \mod 49 \), we use modular arithmetic and the binomial theorem.

### Step 1: Simplify \( 6^{83} \mod 49 \)
Since \( 6 = 7 - 1 \), we expand \( (7 - 1)^{83} \) using the binomial theorem:
\[
(7 - 1)^{83} = \sum_{k=0}^{83} \binom{83}{k} 7^k (-1)^{83-k}.
\]
Modulo \( 49 \) (which is \( 7^2 \)), all terms with \( 7^2 \) or higher powers vanish. Only the first two terms contribute:
\[
(7 - 1)^{83} \equiv \binom{83}{0} 7^0 (-1)^{83} + \binom{83}{1} 7^1 (-1)^{82} \mod 49.
\]
Calculating each term:
- \( \binom{83}{0} 7^0 (-1)^{83} = -1 \),
- \( \binom{83}{1} 7^1 (-1)^{82} = 83 \cdot 7 = 581 \).

Thus:
\[
6^{83} \equiv -1 + 581 = 580 \mod 49.
\]
Now, \( 580 \mod 49 \):  
\( 49 \cdot 11 = 539 \), so \( 580 - 539 = 41 \).  
Therefore, \( 6^{83} \equiv 41 \mod 49 \).

### Step 2: Simplify \( 8^{83} \mod 49 \)
Since \( 8 = 7 + 1 \), we expand \( (7 + 1)^{83} \) using the binomial theorem:
\[
(7 + 1)^{83} = \sum_{k=0}^{83} \binom{83}{k} 7^k (1)^{83-k}.
\]
Modulo \( 49 \), all terms with \( 7^2 \) or higher powers vanish. Only the first two terms contribute:
\[
(7 + 1)^{83} \equiv \binom{83}{0} 7^0 (1)^{83} + \binom{83}{1} 7^1 (1)^{82} \mod 49.
\]
Calculating each term:
- \( \binom{83}{0} 7^0 (1)^{83} = 1 \),
- \( \binom{83}{1} 7^1 (1)^{82} = 83 \cdot 7 = 581 \).

Thus:
\[
8^{83} \equiv 1 + 581 = 582 \mod 49.
\]
Now, \( 582 \mod 49 \):  
\( 49 \cdot 11 = 539 \), so \( 582 - 539 = 43 \).  
Therefore, \( 8^{83} \equiv 43 \mod 49 \).

### Step 3: Combine Results
Adding the two results:
\[
6^{83} + 8^{83} \equiv 41 + 43 = 84 \mod 49.
\]
Finally, \( 84 \mod 49 \):  
\( 49 \cdot 1 = 49 \), so \( 84 - 49 = 35 \).  
Thus, \( (6^{83} + 8^{83}) \mod 49 = 35 \).

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **C**.
