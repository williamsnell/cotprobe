Okay, so I've got this problem here about choosing balls from a box. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So the box has 4 red balls, 3 green, and 2 blue. That's a total of 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 balls. The problem is asking me to find the number of ways to choose 4 balls with the condition that at least 2 are red.

Hmm, right. So I'm dealing with combinations here because the order in which I pick the balls doesn't matter. The key is to calculate all possible combinations where at least two are red. That means I should consider the cases where there are exactly 2 red, 3 red, or all 4 red balls in the selection.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about it. The box only has 4 red balls. So when I'm choosing 4 balls, the maximum reds I can have is 4. So the cases I need are:

1. Exactly 2 red, then the remaining 2 from non-reds.
2. Exactly 3 red, then 1 from non-reds.
3. Exactly 4 red, then 0 from non-reds.

Yes, that makes sense. So I'll calculate each case separately and then add them up.

First, let's find the total number of non-red balls. There are 3 green and 2 blue, so 5 non-red balls.

Case 1: Exactly 2 red and 2 non-red.

The number of ways to choose 2 red balls from 4 is C(4,2). And the ways to choose 2 non-red from 5 is C(5,2). Multiply these two to get the total for this case.

C(4,2) is (4*3)/(2*1) = 6. C(5,2) is (5*4)/(2*1) = 10. So 6 * 10 = 60 ways for this case.

Case 2: Exactly 3 red and 1 non-red.

C(4,3) is 4 ways (since 4 choose 3 is 4). C(5,1) is 5. So 4 * 5 = 20 ways.

Case 3: Exactly 4 red and 0 non-red.

C(4,4) is 1. And since we're not choosing any non-red, that's 1 way. So 1 * 1 = 1 way.

Now, adding all these cases together: 60 + 20 + 1 = 81 ways.

Wait a second, but let me double-check if I got all the cases right. Oh, wait, the total is 81. Let me look at the options. Option G is 81. So that should be the correct answer.

Alternatively, another approach is to calculate the total ways without any restriction and subtract the cases where there are fewer than 2 red balls. Let's see if that gives the same result.

Total ways to choose 4 balls from 9: C(9,4) = 126.

Now, subtract the cases where there are 0 or 1 red balls.

Case 0 red: All 4 from non-red. Non-red are 5 in total, so C(5,4) = 5.

Case 1 red: C(4,1) * C(5,3). C(4,1)=4, C(5,3)=10. So 4*10=40.

So total to subtract is 5 + 40 = 45.

So 126 - 45 = 81. Yep, same result. So that confirms it.

To solve the problem of selecting 4 balls from a box containing 4 red, 3 green, and 2 blue balls, with the condition that at least 2 balls are red, we consider the following cases:

1. **Exactly 2 red and 2 non-red balls**:  
   - Ways to choose 2 red balls from 4: \( \binom{4}{2} = 6 \).  
   - Ways to choose 2 non-red balls from 5 (3 green + 2 blue): \( \binom{5}{2} = 10 \).  
   - Total ways for this case: \( 6 \times 10 = 60 \).

2. **Exactly 3 red and 1 non-red ball**:  
   - Ways to choose 3 red balls from 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).  
   - Ways to choose 1 non-red ball from 5: \( \binom{5}{1} = 5 \).  
   - Total ways for this case: \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \).

3. **Exactly 4 red and 0 non-red balls**:  
   - Ways to choose 4 red balls from 4: \( \binom{4}{4} = 1 \).  
   - Total ways for this case: \( 1 \).

Adding the results from all cases:  
\( 60 + 20 + 1 = 81 \).

Thus, the number of ways to choose 4 balls with at least 2 red balls is **81**.  

The correct answer is **G**.
