Question:

The terrestrial planet cores contain mostly metal because

Okay, so I've got this question about why the cores of terrestrial planets are mostly metal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my planetary science, but let me think through this.

The question gives 10 options, A through J. I need to figure out which one is correct. Let's go through each option and see what makes sense.

Option A says radioactivity from uranium decay created metals in the core. Wait, I don't think that's right. Radioactive decay does produce heat, which might contribute to the Earth's internal heat, but creating metals? I don't think uranium decay creates metals like iron. So probably not A.

Option B suggests metals were attracted to the center because of gravity. That sounds plausible. Heavy elements like iron are denser, so under gravity, maybe they sink to the center. But I think this is part of a process called differentiation. But maybe B is correct, but I'm not sure yet.

Option C says the magnetic field caused metals to migrate. I'm not too sure about that. The Earth's magnetic field is generated by the movement of molten iron in the core. So the magnetic field is a result, not the cause of metals being there. So C might not be right.

Option D is about aliens. That's definitely not a scientific explanation. So D is out.

Option E says the atmosphere's pressure pushed metals to the core. That doesn't make much sense. The atmosphere is way less dense than the metals, so its pressure wouldn't push metals inward. E seems incorrect.

Option F claims the entire planets are mostly metal. Well, terrestrial planets like Earth have a crust, mantle, and core. The core is metal, but the rest is silicate rocks. So F is wrong because the whole planet isn't mostly metal.

Option G says lighter elements floated to the surface, leaving metals in the core. That makes sense because during differentiation, heavier elements sink. But wait, lighter materials would go up, so metals (heavier) go down. So maybe G is correct, but the wording is a bit confusing because it says 'leaving metals in the core'â€”I think that's correct because when the lighter stuff goes up, the denser stays down.

Option H suggests rotation causes heavy metals to fling to the core. I'm not sure about that. I remember that a planet's rotation can cause oblateness, but I don't think it causes heavier elements to move to the center. So H might not be right.

Option I states that metals differentiated to the center when the interiors were molten. Oh, right! Planetary differentiation is when heavier elements like metals sink to the center when the planet is molten. This process happens early in the planet's formation. So I sounds correct.

Option J says metals condensed first in the solar nebula, then rocks formed around them. I think the solar nebula had metals condensing into droplets, which then accreted. But I'm not sure if that's the main reason for the core being metal. Wait, gravitational differentiation is a bigger factor after the planet forms. So J might not be the best answer.

So, thinking back, the process of differentiation when the planet was molten (like during the magma ocean phase) caused heavier metals to sink to the core. That matches option I.

Wait, but what about option B? B says metals were attracted to the center because of gravity. That's technically part of differentiation, but option I explains the process more accurately. So I think I is the better answer.

The cores of terrestrial planets are composed mostly of metal due to a process known as differentiation. Early in the planet's formation, when the interior was largely molten, denser materials like metals sank to the center, while lighter silicate materials rose to the surface. This process is driven by gravity and the fluid dynamics of the molten state. 

Option I correctly describes this process, stating that metals differentiated to the center during a time when the interiors were molten throughout. While Option B touches on gravity attracting metals to the center, it does not fully capture the mechanism of differentiation that occurred when the planet was molten. Therefore, Option I provides the most accurate explanation.

Answer: I
