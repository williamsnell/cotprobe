Okay, so I've got this question where I need to find the variance in the ages of six children. The ages given are 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16. Hmm, variance, right? I remember that variance measures how spread out the numbers are in a dataset. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps, so I need to think this through carefully.

First, I think I should recall the formula for variance. Oh right, variance is the average of the squared differences from the mean. So the steps are: find the mean, then subtract the mean from each value, square each of those differences, and then average them. Since the data set is small, maybe I can do this step by step.

Let me start by calculating the mean age. The ages are 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16. Adding them up: 6+8 is 14, plus 10 is 24, plus 12 is 36, plus 14 is 50, plus 16 is 66. So total is 66. There are 6 children, so the mean is 66 divided by 6. 66/6 is 11. So the mean age is 11.

Next step, I need to find the deviation of each age from the mean. That means subtracting 11 from each age.

So for each age:
- 6: 6 - 11 = -5
- 8: 8 - 11 = -3
- 10: 10 - 11 = -1
- 12: 12 - 11 = +1
- 14: 14 - 11 = +3
- 16: 16 -11 = +5

Now I square each of these deviations to get rid of the negatives and to give more weight to larger differences.

Squaring each:
- (-5)^2 = 25
- (-3)^2 = 9
- (-1)^2 = 1
- (1)^2 = 1
- (3)^2 = 9
- (5)^2 =25

Now I add up these squared deviations. Let's see:
25 +9 is 34, plus 1 is 35, plus another 1 is 36, plus 9 is 45, and another 25 brings it to 70. So the sum is 70.

Since we're calculating the variance for a sample (I think this is a sample, not the entire population), I should use the sample variance formula. Wait, wait. Oh right, sample variance divides by (n-1), while population variance divides by n. So the question says "the variance in ages" and these are all the children's ages, so it's the population. Because it's not a sample taken from a larger group, it's the entire group. So I should use n, which is 6.

So variance is 70 divided by 6. Let me calculate that. 70 รท6 is approximately 11.666..., which is about 11.6667.

Looking at the options, I see option D is 11.7. That's very close. So the answer should be D:11.7.

Wait, but wait another moment. Sometimes I get confused between sample and population variance. Let me double-check. The question says "find the variance in ages." Since it's all the children in the couple's family, it's the entire population. So yes, we divide by n, which is 6. So 70/6 is correct, which is approximately 11.6667, so 11.7 when rounded to one decimal place.

So the correct answer is D.

To calculate the variance in the ages of the six children, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the mean**:  
   The ages are 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16.  
   Sum = \(6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 14 + 16 = 66\).  
   Mean = \(\frac{66}{6} = 11\).

2. **Find the deviations from the mean**:  
   Subtract the mean (11) from each age:  
   \(6 - 11 = -5\), \(8 - 11 = -3\), \(10 - 11 = -1\), \(12 - 11 = 1\), \(14 - 11 = 3\), \(16 - 11 = 5\).

3. **Square the deviations**:  
   \((-5)^2 = 25\), \((-3)^2 = 9\), \((-1)^2 = 1\), \((1)^2 = 1\), \((3)^2 = 9\), \((5)^2 = 25\).

4. **Sum the squared deviations**:  
   \(25 + 9 + 1 + 1 + 9 + 25 = 70\).

5. **Calculate the variance**:  
   Since this is the entire population (not a sample), divide by \(n = 6\):  
   Variance = \(\frac{70}{6} \approx 11.6667\), which rounds to \(11.7\).

Thus, the variance in ages is approximately **11.7**, corresponding to option **D**.
