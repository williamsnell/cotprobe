The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A 49-year-old man, who is recovering in the hospital 2 days after uncomplicated left femoral-popliteal bypass grafting for claudication, has now developed increasing pain in his left foot. Until now, the patient's postoperative course had been unremarkable and he has been treated with low-dose morphine for pain control. Medical history is remarkable for type 2 diabetes mellitus controlled with metformin and diet. Vital signs now are temperature 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse 80/min and regular, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 150/92 mm Hg. The surgical incision appears clean and well approximated without abnormal erythema or swelling. The left lower extremity and foot appear pale. Palpation of the left lower extremity discloses a strong femoral pulse, a weak popliteal pulse, and a cool, pulseless foot. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?

Options:

A: Intraoperative angiography
B: Intravenous heparin therapy
C: Immediate surgical exploration
D: Initiate antibiotic therapy
E: Computed Tomography (CT) of the lower extremity
F: Intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) therapy
G: Doppler ultrasonography of the left lower extremity
H: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the left lower extremity
I: Bedside compartment pressure measurements
J: Pain management and observation

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a patient who's having some complications after surgery. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The patient is a 49-year-old man who had a left femoral-popliteal bypass grafting two days ago. His main issue was claudication, which I remember is a symptom of intermittent leg pain, usually during walking, caused by insufficient blood flow. The bypass grafting is a procedure to improve blood flow in the leg.

Now, he's developed increasing pain in his left foot. Before this, his recovery was going fine, and he was on low-dose morphine for pain. His medical history includes type 2 diabetes controlled with metformin and diet. His vitals are mostly normal except maybe the blood pressure is a bit high but not dangerously so. 

Looking at the physical exam, the surgical incision looks clean, no redness or swelling, so infection doesn't seem to be the issue right now. The left lower extremity and foot are pale. When they checked the pulses, the femoral pulse is strong, but the popliteal is weak, and the foot is cool and pulseless. 

So, the key here is the sudden onset of foot pain, paleness, and lack of pulses in the foot. The femoral pulse is strong, so the problem isn't in the femoral artery. The popliteal pulse is weak, so maybe there's an issue between the femoral and popliteal areas, or perhaps the graft itself is having a problem.

I'm thinking this might be a graft occlusion. After bypass surgery, one of the complications is graft failure, which can be due to thrombosis. If the graft gets blocked, the blood flow to the lower extremity beyond that point would be compromised. That would explain why the foot is cool and pulseless—the blood isn't getting there.

So, what's the management in this case? The options are A through J. Let's go through them.

Option A: Intraoperative angiography. That's usually done during surgery, but the patient is already post-op. It might not be the first step now unless they're considering taking him back to the OR.

Option B: Intravenous heparin. Heparin is an anticoagulant. If the graft is occluded with a clot, heparin could help prevent further clotting. But would that resolve the existing blockage? Maybe, but I'm not sure if that's the immediate action needed.

Option C: Immediate surgical exploration. That sounds like going back into surgery to check the graft. If the graft is thrombosed, they might need to revise it or remove the clot. This seems like a possible option because the patient's symptoms suggest acute limb ischemia, which is an emergency.

Option D: Antibiotics. The incision is clean, so infection isn't indicated. No signs of fever either. So D doesn't seem right.

Option E: CT of the lower extremity. CT angiography could show where the blockage is. But since the patient is stable, but the limb is at risk, waiting for imaging might delay treatment. Plus, in an acute setting, time is of the essence.

Option F: Intra-arterial tPA. tPA is a clot-busting drug. If used intra-arterially, it could dissolve the clot. But tPA has risks like bleeding, and it's usually considered for acute ischemic strokes or pulmonary embolism. I'm not sure if it's the first choice here, especially if the graft is kinked or there's a technical issue.

Option G: Doppler ultrasonography. That's a non-invasive way to check blood flow. It could confirm whether there's a blockage. But again, time is critical. If the patient's foot is cool and pulseless, the diagnosis is probably clear, and waiting for an ultrasound might delay necessary treatment.

Option H: MRI. MRI would give detailed images but is time-consuming. In an acute setting, it's probably not the first choice.

Option I: Compartment pressure measurements. That's for diagnosing compartment syndrome, which causes pain and can lead to limb ischemia. But the symptoms here point more to a vascular issue rather than compartment syndrome. Plus, the foot being pale and pulseless is more about blood flow than compartment pressure.

Option J: Pain management and observation. That doesn't seem right because the patient is showing signs of limb ischemia, which is an emergency. Observation would risk losing the limb.

So, putting it all together, the most likely issue is graft occlusion leading to acute limb ischemia. The best immediate management would be to take the patient back to surgery to explore and fix the graft. That's option C. Alternatively, some might consider heparin (B) to prevent further clotting, but if the graft is blocked, heparin alone won't recanalize it. They might need to do something more immediate.

Another thought: could it be a popliteal artery issue beyond the graft? Since the femoral pulse is strong but the popliteal is weak, the problem is likely in the graft or just beyond. So either way, surgical exploration is needed to fix it.

So the answer should be C: Immediate surgical exploration.
</think>

The patient is a 49-year-old man recovering from left femoral-popliteal bypass grafting for claudication. Two days postoperatively, he develops increasing left foot pain, with the foot appearing pale, cool, and pulseless. The femoral pulse is strong, but the popliteal pulse is weak. These findings suggest acute limb ischemia, likely due to graft occlusion, which is a surgical emergency.

**Analysis of options:**

- **A: Intraoperative angiography** is typically used during surgery, not applicable in this postoperative setting unless surgery is reiminitiated.  
- **B: Intravenous heparin therapy** could prevent further clotting but would not resolve the existing occlusion.  
- **C: Immediate surgical exploration** is the most appropriate response, as it allows direct visualization and correction of the graft occlusion, addressing the acute ischemia.  
- **D: Initiate antibiotic therapy** is unnecessary, as there are no signs of infection.  
- **E: CT of the lower extremity** could confirm the diagnosis but would delay critical treatment.  
- **F: Intra-arterial tPA therapy** carries risks and is less definitive than surgery for graft occlusion.  
- **G: Doppler ultrasonography** could confirm ischemia but would delay definitive treatment.  
- **H: MRI of the lower extremity** is not practical in this acute setting due to time constraints.  
- **I: Bedside compartment pressure measurements** are irrelevant, as the issue is vascular, not related to compartment syndrome.  
- **J: Pain management and observation** would risk limb loss and is inappropriate for acute ischemia.

The most appropriate management is **C: Immediate surgical exploration**, as it directly addresses the likely graft occlusion and restores blood flow to the ischemic limb.

Answer: C
