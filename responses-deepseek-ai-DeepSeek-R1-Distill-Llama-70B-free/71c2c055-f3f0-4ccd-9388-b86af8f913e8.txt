Question:

A property owner owned a large building in the city. The owner leased the building to a shopkeeper for a period of 20 years at a rental of $10,000 per month. The leasehold agreement between property owner and shopkeeper provided that the latter was not permitted "to assign this lease to anyone except a corporation with an A' credit rating from a well- known credit rating company. " One month later, the shopkeeper leased the premises to a corporation that did not have the required credit rating. The shopkeeper-corporation lease was for a period of five years, with a rental of $15,000 per month, payable by the corporation to the shopkeeper. In addition, the corporation agreed to abide "by all of the terms and conditions of the lease between the property owner and the shopkeeper. "One year later, the corporation leased the premises to a non-profit organization for the balance of the term of the corporation shopkeeper lease. The non-profit organization took possession of the said premises the same day that the corporation vacated its occupancy. Pursuant to the corporation nonprofit leasehold agreement, the latter was obligated to pay a monthly rental of $17,500 directly to the corporation. The non-profit organization has a B' credit rating with the well-known credit rating company. Which of the following is not correct regarding the legal relationship(s) of the various parties?

Options:

A: Privity of estate and privity of contract exist between the property owner and the non-profit organization.
B: Privity of estate and privity of contract exist between the corporation and the non-profit organization.
C: Privity of contract, but not privity of estate, exists between the shopkeeper and the non-profit organization.
D: Privity of estate and privity of contract exist between the property owner and the shopkeeper.
E: Privily of estate, but not privily of contract, exists between property owner and the corporation.
F: Neither privity of estate nor privity of contract exists between the shopkeeper and the non-profit organization.
G: Neither privily of estate nor privily of contract exists between the property owner and the nonprofit organization.
H: Neither privity of estate nor privity of contract exists between the corporation and the non-profit organization.
I: Privily of estate and privity of contract exist between the shopkeeper and the corporation.
J: Privity of contract, but not privity of estate, exists between the property owner and the corporation.

Okay, so I've got this property law question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, so the situation is a property owner leased a building to a shopkeeper for 20 years. The lease says the shopkeeper can't assign the lease to anyone except a corporation with an 'A' credit rating. Then, the shopkeeper leased it to a corporation without that rating. The corporation later subleases to a non-profit with a 'B' rating.

The question is about the legal relationships, specifically privity of estate and privity of contract between various parties. I need to find which option is not correct.

First, I should remember what privity of estate and privity of contract mean. Privity of estate refers to a legal relationship between two parties where one has a right to possess the property and the other has the right to receive it. So, like a landlord and tenant have privity of estate because the tenant has possession.

Privity of contract means that two parties are bound by a contract between them. So, the original lease between the property owner and the shopkeeper creates a privity of contract between them, and they also have privity of estate because the shopkeeper is in possession.

Now, let's break down the events.

1. Property Owner (PO) leases to Shopkeeper (S) for 20 years. So, PO and S have both privity of contract and privity of estate.

2. S leases to Corporation (C) for 5 years. But wait, the lease agreement says S can only assign to a corp with an 'A' credit rating. Since C doesn't have that, is this assignment valid? I think that the lease's condition is probably enforceable, so S's lease to C might be a breach of the lease agreement. But does that make the lease to C invalid? Or is it just a breach, allowing PO to take action against S but C's lease still stands unless PO takes action?

If S wasn't allowed to assign without PO's consent, then assigning to C would be a breach, but the assignment might still be effective unless the lease prohibits it. So, S and C would have a lease agreement, so privity of contract exists between S and C. As for privity of estate, since C is in possession, they have that between them.

3. Then C subleases to Non-Profit (N) for the remaining term of C's lease (which is 4 years, since 5 years minus 1 year). So, C and N have a lease, so privity of contract and privity of estate between them.

Now, the question is about the relationships between various parties.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Privity of estate and contract between PO and N. Is that correct? PO is the head landlord, S is the tenant, C is a subtenant, and N is a sub-subtenant. Unless there's an assignment, PO and N don't have a direct relationship. So PO and N would not have privity of contract because there's no direct lease between them. They might not have privity of estate either because N is holding through C, who holds through S, who holds through PO. So A is saying both exist, which would be incorrect. So if A is an option, it's wrong.

Option B: Privity between C and N. Yes, they have both, so B is correct.

Option C: Privity of contract between S and N, but not estate. S and N don't have a contract directly. S's contract is with C, and C's with N. So no privity of contract between S and N. So C would be incorrect because it says there's a privity of contract, which there isn't. So C is wrong.

Option D: PO and S have both, which is correct. So D is correct.

Option E: PO and C have privity of estate but not contract. Wait, PO and C: PO has a lease with S, and S assigned to C without consent. So, if the assignment was prohibited, does that affect the relationship between PO and C? If it's an assignment, PO would have privity of estate with C, but only if the assignment was valid. Alternatively, if the assignment is invalid, then PO's tenant is still S, and C is just an unauthorized occupant. Wait, but I think that the assignment would transfer the possessory rights, so PO and C would have privity of estate (since C is in possession), but PO's contract is with S. So between PO and C, there's privity of estate (because C is in possession under the lease from S), but not privity of contract because the lease is between PO and S. So E says privity of estate exists but not contract. So E is correct.

Option F: No privity between S and N. That's correct because S's lease is with C, and C's with N. So F is correct.

Option G: No privity between PO and N. Correct, because PO's lease is with S. So G is correct.

Option H: No privity between C and N. No, that's wrong because C and N have both. So if H says neither exists, it's incorrect.

Wait, let me check. Option H says neither exists between C and N, which is wrong because they have both. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Shopkeeper and Corp have both. Yes, S and C have a lease, so privity of contract and estate. So I is correct.

Option J: PO and Corp have privity of contract but not estate? Wait, no. PO's contract is with S, not C. So between PO and C, there's privity of estate (because C is in possession under S's lease), but no privity of contract. So J says privity of contract exists but not estate, which is the opposite. So J is incorrect.

Wait, let me clarify: If S assigned the lease to C without permission (违反了lease的条件), does that affect the privity between PO and C? Because in some cases, an assignment can create a new privity of estate but not contract. So PO and C would have privity of estate because C is in possession, but the contract is still between PO and S. So PO and C have privity of estate (C is the tenant in possession), but not privity of contract.

So looking back at the options:

Option E says: Privity of estate exists (correct) but not contract (correct). So E is correct.

Option J says: Privity of contract exists (incorrect) but not estate (incorrect). So J is wrong because it says contract exists when it doesn't.

So which options are incorrect?

The question asks which is NOT correct regarding the legal relationships.

Looking at all options:

Option A: PO and N have both. This is wrong because there's no direct contract or estate between them. So A is incorrect.

Option C: S and N have contract but not estate. But S and N have no contract, so C is wrong.

Option H: C and N have neither. Wrong, because they have both, so H is incorrect.

Option J: PO and Corp have contract but not estate. Wrong, because PO and Corp have estate but not contract.

So the question is which is not correct. So the incorrect statements are A, C, H, J.

Now, looking at the options given, which one is incorrect.

The question is to pick the option that is not correct.

Wait, let me go through each option again.

Option A: Privity of estate and contract between PO and N. No, because N is a subtenant of C, who is a tenant of S, who is tenant of PO. So PO and N have no direct privity of contract or estate. So A is incorrect.

Option C: Privity of contract exists between S and N, but no estate. No, because S has no direct contract with N. So C is incorrect.

Option E: PO and C have estate but not contract. Correct, because PO's contract is with S, but C is in possession, so estate exists.

Option H: No privity between C and N. Incorrect, because they have both.

Option J: PO and C have contract but not estate. Incorrect, because it's the opposite.

So which of the options is not correct. The question is which is incorrect.

Now, looking at the options, the incorrect ones are A, C, H, J.

So the question is which of the options is not correct. Let me read the options again.

The question is about which is not correct regarding the legal relationships.

Looking at each option:

A: PO and N have both. Incorrect, as no direct relationship.

B: C and N have both. Correct.

C: S and N have contract but not estate. Incorrect, as no contract.

D: PO and S have both. Correct.

E: PO and C have estate but not contract. Correct.

F: No privity between S and N. Correct.

G: No privity between PO and N. Correct.

H: No privity between C and N. Incorrect.

I: S and C have both. Correct.

J: PO and C have contract but not estate. Incorrect.

So now, the options that are incorrect are A, C, H, J.

The question is which option is not correct. So among the options, each of these is an incorrect statement.

Now, the question provides options from A to J, and asks which is not correct.

So the possible answers are A, C, H, J.

Looking back at the question, the options are:

A: PO and N both

B: C and N both

C: S and N contract only

D: PO and S both

E: PO and C estate only

F: No between S and N

G: No between PO and N

H: No between C and N

I: S and C both

J: PO and C contract only

Now, which of these is not correct.

The correct relationships are:

- PO and S: both (D correct)

- S and C: both (I correct)

- C and N: both (B correct)

- PO and C: estate only (E correct)

- PO and N: neither (so G correct)

- S and N: neither (so F correct)

- S and N: no contract, so C is wrong.

So which of the options is incorrect:

A: PO and N both → wrong.

C: S and N contract → wrong.

H: C and N neither → wrong.

J: PO and C contract → wrong.

So the question is, which of the options is not correct. So the correct answer is the option that states something incorrect.

Looking at the options, the question is to choose which is not correct.

So the incorrect options are A, C, H, J.

Now, looking at the options, the question is about which is not correct.

So I need to find which option is incorrect.

The question is about which is not correct.

Let me think:

Option A says PO and N have both. But they don't. So A is incorrect.

Option C says S and N have contract but not estate. But S and N have neither, so C is incorrect.

Option H says C and N have neither. But they have both, so H is incorrect.

Option J says PO and C have contract but not estate. But PO and C have estate but not contract, so J is incorrect.

So the incorrect options are A, C, H, J.

The question is to pick which is not correct. The options are A to J. So I need to look at the options and see which is the incorrect statement.

The question is which is not correct. So the correct answer is the option that is incorrect.

Looking back at the problem, the question asks: Which of the following is not correct regarding the legal relationships?

So the correct answer is the option that is incorrect.

Now, let's look at each option again.

Option A: PO and N have both. Incorrect.

Option C: S and N have contract but not estate. Incorrect.

Option H: C and N have neither. Incorrect.

Option J: PO and C have contract but not estate. Incorrect.

So the question is which option is not correct. So all of A, C, H, J are incorrect, but the options only list one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding privity of estate and contract in some cases.

Wait, let's think about the initial lease between PO and S. S assigns to C without permission. Does that affect the privity?

If S assigns the lease to C, even without permission, then C becomes the tenant, and PO and C have privity of estate, but the privity of contract is still between PO and S because the lease was between PO and S. Unless the assignment is prohibited and thus invalid, but I think in most cases, the assignment would be valid, but in breach of the lease terms, allowing PO to terminate if they choose.

So in that case, PO and C would have privity of estate (since C is in possession under the lease), but no privity of contract because the lease is between PO and S. So PO's privity of contract remains with S.

So looking at option J: "Privity of contract, but not privity of estate, exists between property owner and the corporation." That's incorrect because PO and C have estate, not contract.

So option J is incorrect.

Similarly, option E states that privity of estate exists but not contract between PO and C, which is correct.

So which options are incorrect?

Now, let's consider the sublease from C to N. C and N have both privity of contract and estate.

Now, looking at the options:

Option C: Privity of contract, but not estate, exists between S and N. That's incorrect because S and N have neither. So option C is wrong.

Option F: Neither exists between S and N. Correct.

Option I: S and C have both. Correct.

Now, the question is, among the options, which is incorrect.

The question is which option is not correct.

So looking at each option:

A: Incorrect.

B: Correct.

C: Incorrect.

D: Correct.

E: Correct.

F: Correct.

G: Correct.

H: Incorrect.

I: Correct.

J: Incorrect.

So the options A, C, H, J are incorrect.

But the question is which is not correct, so the possible answers are A, C, H, J.

But wait, the question gives options A to J, and we have to choose one. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Let me re-express the relationships:

- PO and S: both contract and estate (D correct).

- S and C: both (I correct).

- C and N: both (B correct).

- PO and C: estate only (E correct).

- PO and N: neither (G correct).

- S and N: neither (F correct).

So looking at the options:

Option A: PO and N both → wrong.

Option C: S and N have contract → wrong.

Option H: C and N neither → wrong.

Option J: PO and C have contract → wrong.

So all of these are incorrect.

Now, the question is which is not correct regarding the legal relationships.

So the correct answer is the option that is not correct, i.e., an incorrect statement.

The options are:

A: Incorrect.

C: Incorrect.

H: Incorrect.

J: Incorrect.

So which one is the correct answer to the question? The question is asking which is not correct, so any of these options would be correct as the answer.

But wait, the question is a multiple-choice with only one correct answer. So perhaps I need to re-examine.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option A. Let me think again.

Option A: Privity of estate and contract exist between PO and N.

Is there any way that PO and N could have privity of contract?

No, because N is a subtenant of C, who is a tenant of S, who is a tenant of PO. There is no direct lease between PO and N, so no privity of contract. Privity of estate would require that N is holding directly from PO, which isn't the case. So PO and N have neither.

So option A is incorrect.

Similarly, option C says that S and N have privity of contract but not estate. But S's lease is with C, and C's with N. So S and N have no direct contract, so option C is incorrect.

Option H says C and N have neither. But they have both, so H is incorrect.

Option J says PO and C have contract but not estate. But they have estate, not contract, so J is incorrect.

So the incorrect options are A, C, H, J.

But the question is which one is not correct, so the answer must be one of these.

Wait, perhaps the original assignment from S to C was invalid because it violated the lease terms. If the lease prohibits assignment except to an 'A' corp, and C doesn't have that, then the assignment may be invalid, meaning S remains the tenant, and C is merely a licensee or in possession without a valid lease.

In that case, PO and S still have the lease, and C's possession is through S, not as an assignee. So in that scenario, PO and C would not have privity of estate because C is holding over from S without a valid assignment. So the lease would still be between PO and S, making C merely an occupant without a lease.

But wait, that depends on whether the lease clause is a covenant that can be enforced. If the lease says that S cannot assign without consent, and S does assign without consent, then the assignment is in breach, but it may still be effective unless the lease provides for termination or forfeiture.

In property law, an assignment in violation of a lease's terms can lead to a breach, but the assignment itself is usually valid unless the lease includes a provision that such an assignment would result in termination. So in this case, unless the lease includes a forfeiture clause, the assignment from S to C would still be valid, making C the new tenant, and PO would have privity of estate with C, but not contract.

So I think the initial analysis stands: PO and C have privity of estate but not contract.

Therefore, going back to the options:

Option J says PO and Corp have contract but not estate. That's incorrect because they have estate, not contract.

So option J is incorrect.

Similarly, option E says PO and Corp have estate but not contract, which is correct.

So among the options, J is incorrect.

Wait, but earlier I thought that A, C, H, and J are incorrect. But perhaps the correct answer is A, or maybe J.

But the question asks which option is not correct. So the answer is the option that is incorrect.

So looking at the options, the correct answer is A, C, H, or J.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to approach this differently.

The question is which option is not correct.

Option A: PO and N both → incorrect.

Option C: S and N contract → incorrect.

Option H: C and N neither → incorrect.

Option J: PO and C contract → incorrect.

So which one of these is the correct answer to the question.

Wait, the question is multiple-choice, so likely only one option is correct as the answer. So perhaps I
