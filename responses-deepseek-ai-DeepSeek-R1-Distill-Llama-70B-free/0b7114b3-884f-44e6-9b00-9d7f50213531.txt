Okay, so I need to figure out the change in entropy of a gas when its temperature increases from 100 K to 101 K, with heat added and volume kept constant. Hmm, I remember that entropy change has something to do with heat transfer and temperature. Oh right, the formula for entropy change is ΔS = Q_rev / T. But wait, since the volume is constant, the process is probably isochoric, so Q would be related to the heat capacity at constant volume.

Right, at constant volume, the heat added (Qv) is equal to n Cv ΔT, where Cv is the molar heat capacity at constant volume. So Q = n Cv (T2 - T1). But wait, what's the value of Cv for an ideal gas? I think for monoatomic gases, Cv is (3/2) R, and for diatomic, it's (5/2) R. Oh wait, but the question doesn't specify, so maybe I'm supposed to assume something else. Or perhaps it's given as a monatomic gas, but the question doesn't say. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem asks for the change in entropy when heat is added at constant volume. So regardless of the type of gas, the formula is ΔS = n Cv ln(T2/T1). Because when volume is constant, the entropy change is n Cv times the natural log of the temperature ratio.

But wait, the temperature change is from 100 K to 101 K. So T increases by 1 K. Let's plug in numbers. Cv is (3/2 R) for monoatomic, but maybe the question expects a different approach. Alternatively, maybe it's using the approximation for small temperature changes, where ln(T2/T1) ≈ ΔT / T_avg. Or perhaps it's using the formula assuming T is in Kelvin.

Wait, but what if the problem is using the formula for entropy change at constant volume as ΔS = (n R) ln(V2/V1) + n Cv ln(T2/T1), but since volume is constant, the first term (volume change) is zero. So only the second term remains, which is n Cv ln(T2/T1). But without knowing n, that's a problem. Wait the options are per mole, so n is probably 1 mole.

So if n =1, then ΔS = Cv ln(101/100). But I'm not sure about the value of Cv. Let me think. For monoatomic gases, Cv is (3/2) R, and R is 8.314 J/mol·K. So Cv would be about 12.471 J/mol·K. But wait, the options are way lower than that. Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake.

Wait the temperature change is small, 1 K. So the entropy change can be approximated as ΔS ≈ Q / T, but at constant volume, Q is n Cv ΔT. So ΔS = (n Cv ΔT) / T. Because T is approximately constant over a small change. So since n=1, ΔS = Cv * (ΔT) / T.

Wait, let's compute that. T is 100 K, ΔT is 1 K. So ΔS ≈ Cv * (1) / 100. If Cv is (3/2 R), then (3/2 * 8.314) * (1/100). Let's calculate that. 8.314 * 3/2 is about 12.471. Divided by 100 gives 0.12471 J/mol·K. Looking at the options, option D is 0.125 J/mol·K, which is close. Alternatively, if Cv is (5/2 R), which is for diatomic gases, then (5/2 * 8.314) is about 20.785, divided by 100 would be 0.20785, which is around 0.208, but that's not among the options. So the correct approach must be using Cv as (3/2 R), giving 0.1247, which is approximately 0.125, option D.

Wait, but the options list D as 0.125 Joule/mole·K, which matches this. But I should double-check the formula. So when volume is constant, dS = (dQ_rev)/T. And dQ_rev at constant volume is Cv dT. So integrating, ΔS = ∫(Cv / T) dT from T_initial to T_final. But that integral is Cv ln(T_final / T_initial). But for small changes, ln(101/100) is approximately (1/100), so ln(1.01) ≈ 0.00995, but wait, wait wait. Wait, no, because 101/100 is 1.01, ln(1.01) is roughly 0.00995, but if I use the exact formula, it's Cv * ln(101/100) = (3/2 R) * 0.00995. Let's compute that.

(3/2)*8.314 = 12.471 J/mol·K. Multiply by ln(1.01) which is approximately 0.00995. So 12.471 * 0.00995 ≈ 0.1241 J/mol·K. So about 0.124, which is 0.125 when rounded. So option D is correct.

But wait, what if the problem uses a different approximation? Another approach is to consider that for small temperature changes, the entropy change can be approximated as ΔS ≈ Cv (ΔT)/T. Which is the same as the previous approach, giving the same result.

So the correct answer should be D: 0.125 Joule/mole·K.

To determine the change in entropy of a gas when its temperature increases from 100 K to 101 K at constant volume, we use the formula for entropy change at constant volume:

\[
\Delta S = n C_v \ln\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)
\]

Here:
- \( n \) is the number of moles (assumed to be 1 mole since the options are given per mole),
- \( C_v \) is the molar heat capacity at constant volume,
- \( T_1 = 100 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_2 = 101 \, \text{K} \).

For a monoatomic ideal gas, \( C_v = \frac{3}{2} R \), where \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/mol·K} \). Substituting \( R \), we get:

\[
C_v = \frac{3}{2} \cdot 8.314 = 12.471 \, \text{J/mol·K}.
\]

The temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \frac{101}{100} = 1.01.
\]

The natural logarithm of this ratio is approximately:

\[
\ln(1.01) \approx 0.00995.
\]

Substituting into the formula for entropy change:

\[
\Delta S = 1 \cdot 12.471 \cdot 0.00995 \approx 0.1241 \, \text{J/mol·K}.
\]

This value rounds to \( 0.125 \, \text{J/mol·K} \), which matches option D. Therefore, the change in entropy of the gas is:

**D: 0.125 Joule/mole·K**
