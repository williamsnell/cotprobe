Okay, so I have this question about the variance of a random variable when you add a constant to it. Hmm, I remember that variance measures how spread out the data is, right? But wait, what happens when you add a constant to every possible value the variable can take?

Let me think. Oh right, variance is all about the spread, so adding a constant shouldn't change how spread out the data is. Like, if you have data points and you add, say, 5 to each, they're all shifted by the same amount. So the differences between them should stay the same. That means the variance doesn't change when you add a constant. But wait, I'm being asked about the variance of X + b, where b is a constant.

Wait, but to be thorough, maybe I should recall the formula for variance. The variance of X is E[X²] minus (E[X])². So for X + b, the expectation would change, but the variance... Let's compute it.

E[X + b] is E[X] + b. Then, the variance would be E[(X + b)²] minus (E[X + b])². Let's expand that:

E[(X + b)²] = E[X² + 2bX + b²] = E[X²] + 2bE[X] + b².

Then, (E[X + b])² is (E[X] + b)² = E[X]² + 2bE[X] + b².

Subtracting the two, the variance of X + b is (E[X²] + 2bE[X] + b²) - (E[X]² + 2bE[X] + b²) = E[X²] - (E[X])², which is exactly the same as Var(X). So adding a constant b doesn't affect the variance.

So looking at the options, the correct answer should be the one that says Var(X), which is option J.

The variance of a random variable measures its spread or dispersion. When a constant \( b \) is added to the random variable \( X \), the entire distribution of \( X \) shifts by \( b \), but the spread remains unchanged. Mathematically, the variance of \( X + b \) is calculated as:

\[
\text{Var}(X + b) = E[(X + b)^2] - [E(X + b)]^2
\]

Expanding \( E[(X + b)^2] \):

\[
E[(X + b)^2] = E[X^2 + 2bX + b^2] = E[X^2] + 2bE[X] + b^2
\]

And \( [E(X + b)]^2 \) is:

\[
[E(X + b)]^2 = (E[X] + b)^2 = E[X]^2 + 2bE[X] + b^2
\]

Subtracting these two expressions:

\[
\text{Var}(X + b) = (E[X^2] + 2bE[X] + b^2) - (E[X]^2 + 2bE[X] + b^2) = E[X^2] - [E(X)]^2 = \text{Var}(X)
\]

Thus, adding a constant \( b \) to \( X \) does not change its variance. The correct answer is:

**J: VarX**
