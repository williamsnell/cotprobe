Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about the naming of a benzene compound. The question is about para-dichlorobenzene being used as mothballs and asks for another name for it. The options are A through J, each with different numbers and positions.

Hmm, I remember that in benzene rings, the substituents can be named using ortho, meta, para prefixes. Para means they're opposite each other, right? So para-dichlorobenzene would have the two chlorine atoms on opposite carbons of the benzene ring.

Wait, benzene has six carbons in a ring. So if I number them, let's say one Cl is on carbon 1. Since it's para, the other Cl should be on carbon 4, because that's directly opposite. So that would make it 1,4-dichlorobenzene. Oh wait, is that correct?

Wait another thing, sometimes the numbering can be done in a way to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers. So for para, the positions are 1 and 4, or 2 and 5, or 3 and 6. But the correct IUPAC name would use the lowest possible numbers. So between 1,4 and say 2,5, 1 comes first.

Wait, but when you have two substituents, you number the ring to give them the lowest possible set of numbers. So in the case of para, the substituents are on 1 and 4, which are two positions apart. So the correct IUPAC name would be 1,4-dichlorobenzene.

Looking back at the options, option A is 1,4-dichlorobenzene. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. Para is 1,4. So yes, para-dichlorobenzene is 1,4-dichlorobenzene. So the answer should be A.

Para-dichlorobenzene refers to a benzene ring with two chlorine atoms positioned opposite each other. In IUPAC nomenclature, this is equivalent to 1,4-dichlorobenzene, as the substituents are numbered to give the lowest possible set of numbers. Among the given options, the correct name for para-dichlorobenzene is **1,4-dichlorobenzene**.

Answer: A
