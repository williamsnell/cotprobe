Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it properly.

The question is asking for the smallest whole number that satisfies three conditions. Specifically, when this number is divided by 4, the remainder is 1. When it's divided by 3, the remainder is also 1. And when it's divided by 5, the remainder is 2. The options given are A through J, each with different numbers. My task is to find which of these is the correct answer.

Hmm, so the problem is about finding a number that meets multiple modular conditions. I remember that this kind of problem is related to the Chinese Remainder Theorem, but I'm not sure about the exact method. Let me think about another approach.

Let me break down each condition one by one.

First condition: the number leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 4. So mathematically, the number N can be expressed as N = 4k + 1, where k is some integer.

Second condition: N leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 3. So N can also be written as N = 3m + 1, where m is another integer.

Third condition: N leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 5. So N is 5n + 2, where n is an integer.

Now, since N must satisfy all three conditions simultaneously, I need to find the smallest such N.

Maybe I can list numbers that satisfy each condition and look for the smallest common one.

Starting with the first condition: numbers that are 1 mod 4. So numbers like 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 41, 45, 49, 53, 57, 61, 65, 69, 73, 77, etc.

Similarly, numbers that are 1 mod 3 are 1,4,7,10,13,16,19,22,25,28,31,34,37,40,43,46,49,52,55,58,61,64,67,70,73,76,79,...

And numbers that are 2 mod 5 are 2,7,12,17,22,27,32,37,42,47,52,57,62,67,72,77,82,...

Now, I need to find the smallest number that appears in all three lists.

Looking at the first few numbers in each list:

From the first list (mod4): 1,5,9,13,17,21,25,29,33,37,41,45,49,53,57,61,65,69,73,77,...

Second list (mod3): 1,4,7,10,13,16,19,22,25,28,31,34,37,40,43,46,49,52,55,58,61,64,67,70,73,76,79,...

Third list (mod5): 2,7,12,17,22,27,32,37,42,47,52,57,62,67,72,77,...

Let me look for the smallest number that is common in all three.

Looking at the numbers:

Check 1: Is 1 in all lists? The third list starts at 2, so no.

Next, 5: not in the third list.

9: no.

13? Let's see: 13 is in the first list. Is it in the second? Second list has 13, yes. But is 13 in the third list? Third list is 2,7,12,17... 13 is not present. So no.

Next, 17: First list has 17. Second list: Let's see, 17 divided by 3 is 5 with remainder 2, so 17 is not 1 mod 3. So 17 is not in the second list. So not a match.

21? 21 mod3 is 0, so not 1. So not in second list.

25: 25 mod3 is 1 (25=3*8+1). So 25 is in first and second lists. Is 25 in the third list (mod5=2)? 25 mod5 is 0, so no.

29: 29 mod3 is 2 (since 3*9=27, 29-27=2), so not in second list.

33: 33 mod3 is 0, so not in second list.

37: Let's check. 37 mod4 is 1 (yes, first list). 37 mod3: 3*12=36, so 37 is 1 mod3. So in second list. Now, third list: 37 mod5 is 2? 5*7=35, 37-35=2. Yes! So 37 is in all three lists.

Wait, let me confirm:

- 37 divided by 4: 4*9=36, 37-36=1 → remainder 1 ✔️
- 37 divided by 3: 3*12=36, 37-36=1 → remainder 1 ✔️
- 37 divided by 5: 5*7=35, 37-35=2 → remainder 2 ✔️

Yes, 37 meets all three conditions. Now, looking back at the options, option J is 37. So the answer should be J.

But wait, let me check if there's a smaller number than 37 that satisfies all conditions. Because 37 is the first I found, but perhaps there's a smaller one I missed.

Looking back at the lists:

Looking for the first number common to all three. The third list has 2,7,12,17,22,27,32,37,...

So let's check each of these against the first two lists.

2: mod4 is 2, not 1. So no.

7: mod4 is 3, not 1. So no.

12: mod4 is 0, so no.

17: mod4 is 1 (yes), mod3 is 2 (17/3=5*3=15, 17-15=2), so no.

22: mod4 is 2 (22/4=5*4=20, 22-20=2), so no.

27: mod4 is 3 (27-6*4=27-24=3), so no.

32: mod4 is 0 (32 is divisible by 4), so no.

37: as before, yes.

So yes, 37 is the smallest such number. So the correct answer is J: 37.

To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest whole number \( N \) that satisfies the following conditions:

1. \( N \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \)
2. \( N \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \)
3. \( N \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \)

### Step 1: Express \( N \) in terms of each condition
- From \( N \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \), we can write \( N = 4k + 1 \), where \( k \) is an integer.
- From \( N \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \), we can write \( N = 3m + 1 \), where \( m \) is an integer.
- From \( N \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \), we can write \( N = 5n + 2 \), where \( n \) is an integer.

### Step 2: List numbers that satisfy each condition
- Numbers satisfying \( N \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \): \( 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, \dots \)
- Numbers satisfying \( N \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \): \( 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, 34, 37, \dots \)
- Numbers satisfying \( N \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \): \( 2, 7, 12, 17, 22, 27, 32, 37, 42, 47, 52, 57, 62, 67, 72, 77, \dots \)

### Step 3: Identify the smallest common number
To find the smallest \( N \) that appears in all three lists, we compare the numbers:
- The first number common to all three lists is **37**.

### Step 4: Verify \( N = 37 \)
- \( 37 \div 4 = 9 \) with a remainder of 1, so \( 37 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \).
- \( 37 \div 3 = 12 \) with a remainder of 1, so \( 37 \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \).
- \( 37 \div 5 = 7 \) with a remainder of 2, so \( 37 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \).

Thus, \( N = 37 \) satisfies all three conditions and is the smallest such number.

### Final Answer:
J: 37
