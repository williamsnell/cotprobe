Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about translating an English sentence into a logical formula using propositional logic (PL). The sentence is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully.

The sentence is: "Either England's importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture or China's promoting human rights is not a sufficient condition for South Africa's supplying diamonds."

First, I need to understand each part of this sentence. Let's split it into two main parts connected by "or". 

The first part is "England's importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture." Hmm, necessary condition. I remember that in logic, if A is a necessary condition for B, then B implies A. So, B → A. So here, France's subsidizing agriculture (let's call this F) requires England's importing beef (E) as a necessary condition. So, F → E. Because if F happens, then E must happen. That makes sense.

The second part is "China's promoting human rights is not a sufficient condition for South Africa's supplying diamonds." Okay, sufficient condition. A sufficient condition means if A happens, then B happens. So, if A is a sufficient condition for B, then A → B. But here, it's the negation of that. So, it's not the case that China's promoting human rights (C) is a sufficient condition for South Africa supplying diamonds (S). So, that would mean that the implication C → S is not true. In logic terms, that's ¬(C → S). But I also remember that C → S is equivalent to ¬C ∨ S. So, the negation of that would be ¬(¬C ∨ S), which by De Morgan's law is C ∧ ¬S. Wait, but the question is about the formula, so maybe it's better to represent it as ¬(C → S), which is the same as ¬(¬C ∨ S), but when we write it in PL, we can also represent it as C ∧ ¬S. But I think in the context of the options given, it's more likely to see ¬(C → S) as part of the formula. Alternatively, since the original part is "is not a sufficient condition," it's saying that even if China promotes human rights, South Africa doesn't supply diamonds. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct way to interpret it. Wait, no, because a sufficient condition means that if C happens, then S must happen. If it's not sufficient, then C can happen without S necessarily happening. So, the statement is saying that C does not guarantee S, which is ¬(C → S), which is equivalent to C ∧ ¬S, but I'm not sure if that's directly needed here.

Wait, but the second part is phrased as "China's promoting human rights is not a sufficient condition for South Africa's supplying diamonds." So, the way to write that is ¬(C → S). But in the options, I don't see any that use ∧, so maybe I need to express it in terms of implications and negations as they are.

Putting it all together, the entire sentence is: (E is a necessary condition for F) OR (C is not a sufficient condition for S). So that translates to (F → E) OR ¬(C → S). 

Wait, no. Wait a second. Let me think again. The first part is E being a necessary condition for F. So F → E. The second part is C not being a sufficient condition for S, which is ¬(C → S). So the whole sentence is (F → E) ∨ ¬(C → S). 

Now, looking at the options, I need to find which formula matches this structure. Let's list the options again:

A: (E ⊃ F) ∨ ~(S ⊃ C)
B: (F ≡ E) ∨ ~(C ⊃ S)
C: (F ⊃ E) ∨ ~(C ⊃ S)
D: (E ≡ F) ∨ (C ⊃ S)
E: (E ≡ F) ∨ ~(C ≡ S)
F: (F ⊃ E) ∨ (C ≡ S)
G: (E ⊃ F) ∨ (C ≡ S)
H: (~E ⊃ F) ∨ ~(C ⊃ S)
I: (E ≡ F) ∨ (~C ⊃ S)
J: (E ⊃ F) ∨ ~(C ⊃ S)

Wait, in the first part, the translation is (F → E), which is F ⊃ E. Looking at the options, option C has (F ⊃ E), so that's correct for the first part. The second part is ¬(C → S), which is written as ~(C ⊃ S). So option C has (F ⊃ E) ∨ ~(C ⊃ S), which matches exactly. So option C should be the correct answer.

Wait, but I should check other options to make sure. Let's see:

Option J is (E ⊃ F) ∨ ~(C ⊃ S). Wait, no, because the first part should be F → E, not E → F. So J's first part is E→F, which would mean that if England imports beef, then France subsidizes agriculture. But the original statement says that France's action requires England's action, so it's F→E, not E→F. So J is incorrect for the first part.

Option C is correct because it has F⊃E and ~ (C⊃S), which is exactly what we need. So the answer should be C.

The sentence to symbolize is: "Either England's importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture or China's promoting human rights is not a sufficient condition for South Africa's supplying diamonds."

1. **First Part**: "England's importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture."  
   - If E (England's importing beef) is a necessary condition for F (France's subsidizing agriculture), then F → E. This means that for France to subsidize agriculture, England must import beef.

2. **Second Part**: "China's promoting human rights is not a sufficient condition for South Africa's supplying diamonds."  
   - If C (China's promoting human rights) is not a sufficient condition for S (South Africa's supplying diamonds), then ¬(C → S). This means that China's promoting human rights does not guarantee South Africa's supplying diamonds.

3. **Combining Both Parts**: The sentence is an "or" statement, so it becomes (F → E) ∨ ¬(C → S).

4. **Matching with Options**:  
   - Option C: (F ⊃ E) ∨ ~(C ⊃ S) matches the structure exactly.  
   - Other options either misrepresent the first part (e.g., J has E → F instead of F → E) or do not align with the second part.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**C**
