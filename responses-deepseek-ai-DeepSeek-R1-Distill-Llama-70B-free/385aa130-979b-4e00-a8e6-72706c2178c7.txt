Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about criminal law, specifically regarding the insanity defense. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is about a husband charged with murder who pleads insanity. The jurisdiction in question considers insanity an affirmative defense. The question is asking what the husband needs to prove his defense.

First, I remember that in criminal law, defenses can be either affirmative or negating. An affirmative defense is one where the defendant presents evidence to support a defense that, if true, would negate criminal liability. Insanity is a classic example of an affirmative defense.

Now, the key here is understanding the burden of proof and who carries it. In most jurisdictions, when a defense is an affirmative one, the defendant typically bears the burden of production. That means they have to come forward with some evidence to support the defense. However, the burden of persuasion usually remains with the prosecution. So the prosecution has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant wasn't insane.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify. The burden of production is the responsibility to present evidence, while the burden of persuasion is about who has to convince the jury or judge of the facts. For affirmative defenses, the defendant usually has the burden of production but not the burden of persuasion. So the defendant must provide enough evidence to raise the issue, but the prosecution must then prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defense doesn't apply.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Neither burden of production nor persuasion. That doesn't seem right because affirmative defenses require the defendant to at least produce some evidence.

Option B: Burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. No, that's the prosecution's burden for the elements of the crime, not the defendant's for an affirmative defense.

Option C: Burden of production. This fits because the defendant must produce sufficient evidence to support the insanity claim.

Option D: Responsibility to demonstrate a history of mental illness. Well, that might be part of the evidence, but the question is about the burden, not the content of the evidence.

Option E: Requirement to provide substantial evidence. Substantial evidence is a higher standard than just the burden of production. The burden of production is more about introducing some evidence, not necessarily substantial.

Option F: Obligation to provide expert testimony. While expert testimony is common in insanity cases, it's not necessarily a requirement. The defendant could use other evidence, though in practice, experts are often used.

Option G: Duty to prove innocence. No, that's not correct. The burden is on the prosecution to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The defendant doesn't have to prove innocence.

Option H: Convince the jury of mental instability. That sounds like the burden of persuasion, which in most cases remains with the prosecution, not the defendant.

Option I: Burden of persuasion only. No, because the defendant usually doesn't have the burden of persuasion for affirmative defenses.

So putting it together, the husband has the burden of production, which is option C.

The correct answer is C: the burden of production.

In jurisdictions where insanity is an affirmative defense, the defendant must present sufficient evidence to raise the issue, fulfilling the burden of production. However, the burden of persuasion remains with the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was sane at the time of the crime. 

Answer: C
