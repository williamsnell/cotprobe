Question:

A mechanic agreed in writing to make repairs to a landscaper's truck for $12,000. The mechanic properly made the repairs, but when the landscaper tendered payment, the mechanic refused to deliver the truck unless the landscaper promised to pay an additional $2,000. The customary charge for such work was $14,000. Because the landscaper needed the truck immediately to fulfill existing contractual obligations, and because no rental trucks of the same type were available, the landscaper promised in writing to pay the mechanic an additional $2,000. The mechanic then delivered the truck. Will the mechanic be able to enforce the landscaper's promise to pay the additional $2,000?

Options:

A: No, because the mechanic breached the original contract by demanding extra payment.
B: Yes, because the landscaper could have obtained possession of the truck through legal action rather than by agreeing to the increased payment.
C: No, because the mechanic exploited the landscaper's immediate need for the truck.
D: No, because the landscaper had no reasonable alternative but to yield to the mechanic's wrongful threat.
E: Yes, because the final price is equivalent to the customary charge for such work.
F: No, because the original contract did not include the additional $2,000 payment.
G: Yes, because the landscaper agreed in writing to pay the additional cost.
H: Yes, because the mechanic completed the repairs as agreed.
I: Yes, because the modified contract price did not exceed a reasonable price.
J: No, because the mechanic exerted undue influence over the landscaper with respect to the modification.

Okay, so I've got this question about contract law, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The situation is that a mechanic agreed in writing to repair a landscaper's truck for $12,000. The mechanic did the repairs properly, but when the landscaper tried to pay, the mechanic refused to give back the truck unless the landscaper agreed to pay an extra $2,000. The usual charge for such work is $14,000. The landscaper needed the truck right away for other contracts, and there were no rental trucks available, so he agreed in writing to the extra $2,000. Now, the question is whether the mechanic can enforce that extra $2,000 promise.

Hmm, I remember that contract modifications can sometimes be tricky. I think about the pre-existing duty rule, which says you can't charge extra for doing what you're already supposed to do. So if the mechanic and landscaper had a contract for $12k, the mechanic can't just demand more unless there's consideration for the modification.

Wait, but sometimes if the modification is fair and there are changed circumstances, it can be enforceable. Or maybe if both parties agree, even if it's not a new consideration, it's okay. I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

So in this case, the mechanic did the work as agreed but then held the truck hostage for more money. The landscaper had no choice but to agree because he needed the truck immediately, and no alternatives were available. That sounds like duress or undue influence maybe.

Duress in contract law can make a contract voidable. If someone is forced to agree under pressure, the contract isn't enforceable. But what kind of duress counts? I think it's about whether the pressure was unlawful or unethical. Here, the mechanic is withholding the truck, which the landscaper needs for his business. That could be economic duress.

But wait, the original contract was $12k, and the mechanic wanted $14k, which is the customary charge. So maybe there's consideration because the customary rate is higher. But wait, the original agreement was $12k, so the mechanic can't just demand more unless there's a valid reason.

Alternatively, maybe the modification without consideration isn't enforceable. So the original contract was for $12k, and the mechanic can't get more unless there's new consideration. The fact that the landscaper agreed under duress might mean that the modification is invalid.

So looking at the options:

Option A says no because the mechanic breached the original contract by demanding extra. But the mechanic did the repairs, so maybe it's not a breach yet. The breach would be if he didn't deliver, but he did deliver after the extra was agreed.

Option B says yes because the landscaper could have sued to get the truck. But that's about whether there was duress. If the landscaper had no alternative, maybe he didn't have a real choice.

Option C says no because of exploitation. That sounds like undue influence.

Option D says no because the landscaper had no reasonable alternative. That's about duress again.

Option E says yes because it's the customary charge. But the original contract was for less, so maybe the customary rate doesn't matter.

Option F says no because the original contract didn't include the extra. That's about the pre-existing duty rule.

Option G says yes because the agreement was in writing. But a written agreement under duress isn't enforceable.

Option H says yes because the repairs were done. But that's the original contract.

Option I says yes because the modified price is reasonable. Maybe, but if the original was $12k, and now $14k, but without new consideration, I'm not sure.

Option J says no because of undue influence. That could be the case if the mechanic took advantage of the landscaper's need.

So I'm trying to remember: when a party threatens to breach a contract unless the other party agrees to a modification, is that duress? If the original contract was to deliver the truck after payment, the mechanic is withholding delivery, which is a breach unless the landscaper pays more. So the mechanic is essentially threatening to breach unless paid more. That could be duress because the threat is wrongful.

In such cases, the modification is not enforceable because of economic duress. So the answer would be that the mechanic can't enforce the extra $2k.

Looking at the options, I think D says no because the landscaper had no reasonable alternative but to agree to the wrongful threat. That seems to fit because the threat was to withhold the truck, which the landscaper needed immediately with no alternatives.

Alternatively, J mentions undue influence. But I think the correct doctrine here is duress, specifically economic duress, which would make the additional promise unenforceable. So the answer would be either C, D, or J.

Wait, but the question is about the enforceability. So if the mechanic is using a wrongful threat, the promise is voidable. The options would need to reflect that.

Option D says no because no reasonable alternative. So that's about duress. Option J is about undue influence.

I think economic duress is the right approach here. So the answer is D.

The question revolves around whether the mechanic can enforce the landscaper's promise to pay an additional $2,000 for repairs. The key issue is the enforceability of the modified contract under principles of contract law, particularly focusing on duress and the pre-existing duty rule.

The original contract was for $12,000, and the mechanic completed the repairs as agreed. However, the mechanic refused to deliver the truck unless the landscaper agreed to pay an extra $2,000. The landscaper, needing the truck immediately for contractual obligations and having no alternative options, agreed under pressure. This scenario raises concerns about economic duress, where one party is forced into a modification due to a wrongful threat.

Under contract law, a modification to a contract requires consideration unless it is fair and equitable. In this case, there was no new consideration for the additional $2,000. The mechanic's demand could be seen as a wrongful threat to withhold the truck, which the landscaper desperately needed. Economic duress occurs when a party is compelled to agree to terms due to a lack of reasonable alternatives, rendering the agreement voidable.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** is incorrect because the mechanic did not breach the original contract by performing the repairs.
- **Option B** is incorrect because the landscaper's immediate need and lack of alternatives negate the argument that legal action was a viable option.
- **Option C** touches on exploitation but is less precise than other options regarding the specific legal doctrine of duress.
- **Option D** correctly identifies that the landscaper had no reasonable alternative but to yield to the mechanic's wrongful threat, aligning with the doctrine of economic duress.
- **Option E** is incorrect because the customary charge does not override the original contract terms or the lack of consideration for the modification.
- **Option F** is incorrect because the issue is not merely the absence of the additional payment in the original contract but the lack of consideration and duress.
- **Option G** is incorrect because a written agreement under duress is not enforceable.
- **Option H** is incorrect because the completion of repairs pertains to the original contract, not the enforceability of the modification.
- **Option I** is incorrect because the reasonableness of the price does not address the lack of consideration or duress.
- **Option J** is incorrect because undue influence is not the primary issue here; economic duress is more applicable.

The correct answer is **Option D**, as the landscaper had no reasonable alternative but to agree to the mechanic's wrongful demand, rendering the additional promise unenforceable due to economic duress.

Answer: D
