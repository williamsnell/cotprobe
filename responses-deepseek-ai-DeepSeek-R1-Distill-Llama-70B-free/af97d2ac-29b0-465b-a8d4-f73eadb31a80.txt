Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this attachment question. The scenario is about a 20-month-old child who's acting in a certain way around her mother in a new play environment. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the child clings nervously to her mother and doesn't want to explore. That makes sense because when kids are in new environments, they often stick close to their caregivers as a way of coping with the newness. But then, she suddenly pushes her mother away and doesn't engage in any hugs. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. So she's showing some resistance. 

Her facial expression shows anxiety, but she looks away from her mother. So she's upset but avoiding eye contact. And the mother is also turning away. So the mother isn't responding with comfort, maybe? 

I remember that attachment styles are categorized into secure and insecure, with insecure having subtypes like avoidant, resistant (or ambivalent), and disorganized-disoriented. 

In a secure attachment, the child might show some distress when the parent leaves, but they're easily comforted upon return. They explore the environment comfortably, using the parent as a base.

Insecure avoidant type: The child shows little distress when the parent leaves and doesn't seek comfort when the parent returns. They might avoid the parent.

Insecure resistant/ambivalent: The child is very clingy and anxious when the parent is present. When the parent leaves, the child is extremely distressed, but upon return, the child is angry or resistant to comfort, maybe hitting or pushing away.

Insecure disorganized: The child's behavior is inconsistent and lacks a coherent pattern. They might show fear or confusion, and their reactions don't make sense in the context.

So looking back at the scenario: The child clings but then pushes away when the mother tries to give hugs. The mother turns away, which might indicate that the mother isn't responding appropriately, possibly contributing to an insecure attachment.

Wait, but the child's behavior seems to be a mix of clinginess and then pushing away. That sounds like the resistant type. Because the resistant children are clingy and anxious, but when the parent tries to comfort them, they resist. They have a hard time being comforted and might push away because they're ambivalent—seeking closeness but also angry or frustrated.

So in this case, the child is anxious but then pushes the mother away and doesn't engage in hugs. That fits the resistant/ambivalent pattern. So which option corresponds to that? Let me check the options.

Option D is Insecure resistant. Option A is Secure resistant, which I don't think is a standard classification. Usually, secure is just secure, and resistant is a subtype of insecure.

The mother's action of turning away might be a sign of her own behavior contributing to insecure attachment, but the question is about the child's attachment type.

So the answer should be D: Insecure resistant.

The child in the scenario exhibits behaviors characteristic of an insecure resistant (ambivalent) attachment style. She clings nervously to her mother, showing anxiety in a new environment, but then pushes her mother away and resists comfort when her mother tries to hug her. This ambivalence—seeking closeness but also resisting it—is a hallmark of the insecure resistant attachment type. The mother turning away may indicate a lack of responsiveness, potentially contributing to the child's insecure attachment. Among the options provided, "Insecure resistant" best describes the child's behavior.
