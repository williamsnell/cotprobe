Okay, so I have this question about the digestive system and which organ doesn't secrete digestive enzymes. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking which of the listed organs does NOT secrete digestive enzymes. The options are A: mouth, B: stomach, C: gall bladder, D: small intestine.

I remember that the digestive system has several organs that produce enzymes to break down food. Let's go through each option one by one.

Starting with the mouth, option A. The mouth contains the salivary glands which produce saliva. I recall that saliva has an enzyme called amylase, which breaks down starches into sugars. So the mouth does secrete digestive enzymes. So option A is not the correct answer.

Next is the stomach, option B. The stomach lining secretes various digestive enzymes. I think one of them is pepsin, which breaks down proteins. Also, I remember that the stomach's gastric juice contains hydrochloric acid and mucus, but the enzymes are definitely there. So the stomach does secrete enzymes; B is not the answer.

Option C is the gall bladder. The gall bladder's main function is to store bile that comes from the liver. Bile helps in emulsifying fats, making it easier for enzymes to act on them. But wait, does the gall bladder itself produce enzymes? I think the liver produces bile, and the gall bladder just stores it. Bile doesn't contain digestive enzymes. So the gall bladder doesn't secrete enzymes. Hmm, so option C might be the correct answer.

Then there's the small intestine, option D. I know that the small intestine is a major site for digestion. Enzymes from the pancreas are released into the small intestine, like amylase, lipase, and trypsin. Also, the walls of the small intestine itself secrete enzymes called brush border enzymes, which further break down nutrients. So the small intestine definitely secretes enzymes, meaning D is not the correct answer.

Putting it all together, the gall bladder (option C) is the one that doesn't secrete digestive enzymes. It just stores and releases bile which aids in fat digestion but doesn't contain enzymes.

The question asks which organ in the digestive system does NOT secrete digestive enzymes. Here's the analysis of each option:

- **A: Mouth**  
  The mouth secretes saliva through the salivary glands, which contains the enzyme amylase to break down starches. Therefore, the mouth does secrete digestive enzymes.

- **B: Stomach**  
  The stomach secretes gastric juice containing enzymes like pepsin, which breaks down proteins. Thus, the stomach does secrete digestive enzymes.

- **C: Gall bladder**  
  The gall bladder stores bile produced by the liver and releases it to aid in fat emulsification. However, bile does not contain digestive enzymes, and the gall bladder itself does not produce any enzymes.

- **D: Small intestine**  
  The small intestine secretes brush border enzymes that further digest nutrients, and it also receives pancreatic enzymes via the pancreatic duct. Therefore, the small intestine does secrete digestive enzymes.

The correct answer is the gall bladder, as it does not secrete digestive enzymes.
