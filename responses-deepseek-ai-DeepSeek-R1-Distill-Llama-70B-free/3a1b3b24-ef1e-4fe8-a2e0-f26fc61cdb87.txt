Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Protocol 14 relating to the European Court of Human Rights. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which statement is false. The options are A through D. Let me go through each one.

Option A says Protocol 14 changed the committee that hears admissibility cases from a three-judge to a one-judge formation. I remember that before Protocol 14, cases were often heard by larger panels. I think the idea was to streamline the process. So maybe they reduced the number of judges for admissibility decisions. So A could be true.

Option B: Protocol 14 added a new criterion for admissibility. I'm not too sure about this. I know that admissibility criteria include things like the six-month rule, exhaustion of domestic remedies, and the case not being manifestly ill-founded. Did Protocol 14 add anything new? Hmm. Maybe not. I think Protocol 14 was more about restructuring the Court's operations rather than changing the criteria for admissibility. So B might be the false statement.

Option C: Protocol 14 abolished the Commission of Human Rights. Wait, the Commission was part of the old system. Right, before Protocol 11 came into effect in 1998, the Commission and the Court were separate, and the Commission would first declare cases admissible. But Protocol 11 merged them into a single Court. So Protocol 14 came later, in 2010 I think. So C is probably false because it was Protocol 11 that abolished the Commission, not Protocol 14. But wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. No, I'm pretty sure that the Commission was abolished before Protocol 14. So C is claiming that Protocol 14 did that, which would be incorrect. So C is false.

Option D: Protocol 14 extended the judicial term of office for the European Court judges. I recall that before, judges had terms of six years, and maybe Protocol 14 changed that. I think they extended it to nine years or something like that. So D is true.

Wait, so now I'm confused. The question asks which statement is false. So between B and C. Earlier, I thought B might be false because I didn't think Protocol 14 added new admissibility criteria. But then, I also thought C is false because the Commission was abolished by Protocol 11, not 14.

Wait, let me clarify. Protocol 11 came into force in 1998 and established the Court as a permanent body, replacing the previous part-time Court and the Commission. So the Commission was abolished by Protocol 11, not 14. So option C says Protocol 14 abolished the Commission, which is false. So C is the false statement.

But wait, the options are A to D. So the false statement is either B or C.

Wait, the question is about which is false. So which options are true or false.

Option B: Did Protocol 14 add a new admissibility criterion? I think the admissibility criteria are set by the Convention, but sometimes protocols can modify them. I'm not sure if Protocol 14 did that. Alternatively, maybe it introduced new admissibility rules. Wait, maybe it introduced the possibility of rejecting applications as inadmissible if the applicant hasn't suffered a significant disadvantage. Or was that part of another protocol?

Alternatively, I think Protocol 14 introduced a new admissibility criterion related to cases where the applicant hasn't suffered a significant disadvantage. So that would mean B is true.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. So going back:

Option C says Protocol 14 abolished the Commission. No, that was Protocol 11. So C is false.

Option B says Protocol 14 added a new admissibility criterion. If that's correct, then B is true. But if not, then B is false.

Another point: The main changes in Protocol 14 were about the Court's structure and efficiency. It introduced single-judge formations for admissibility (so A is true), it allowed the Court to declare an application inadmissible if the applicant had not suffered a significant disadvantage (so that's a new criterion, making B true). It also changed the term of judges to a non-renewable nine-year term, so D is true.

Wait, so if B is true, then the false statement would be C, because the Commission was abolished by Protocol 11, not 14.

So the false statement is C.

The question asks which statement is false regarding Protocol 14 of the European Court of Human Rights. Here's the analysis of each option:

- **Option A**: Protocol 14 changed the committee that hears admissibility cases from a three-judge to a one-judge formation. This is true, as Protocol 14 streamlined the process by introducing single-judge formations for admissibility decisions.

- **Option B**: Protocol 14 added a new criterion for admissibility. This is also true. Protocol 14 introduced a new admissibility criterion, allowing the Court to reject cases where the applicant had not suffered a significant disadvantage.

- **Option C**: Protocol 14 abolished the Commission of Human Rights. This is false. The Commission was abolished by Protocol 11, which came into force in 1998, not by Protocol 14.

- **Option D**: Protocol 14 extended the judicial term of office for the European Court of Human Rights. This is true. Protocol 14 extended the term of office for judges from six to nine years.

The false statement is **Option C**, as the Commission was abolished by Protocol 11, not Protocol 14.

Answer: C
