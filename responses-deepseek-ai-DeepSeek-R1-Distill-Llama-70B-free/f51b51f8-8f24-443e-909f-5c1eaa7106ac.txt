Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with algebra, but I'll give it a shot. Let's see what it says.

The problem is about calculating something called M, which is defined as 4a squared minus 2b squared plus a. Then, there are two scenarios: j is when a is 5 and b is 3, and k is when a is -1 and b is 4. After finding j and k, I need to calculate j plus twice k. And then pick the correct answer from the options given.

Alright, let's break this down step by step. First, I need to compute M for each set of values and then combine them.

Starting with j: when a is 5 and b is 3. So plugging into the formula, M would be 4*(5)^2 minus 2*(3)^2 plus 5. Let me calculate each part.

5 squared is 25. Multiply by 4 gives 100. Then 3 squared is 9, multiplied by 2 is 18. So subtracting 18 from 100 gives 82. Then add a, which is 5, so 82 +5 is 87. So j is 87. Hmm, that seems a bit high, but let's check the calculations again. Wait, 4 times 5 squared is 4*25=100. 2 times 3 squared is 2*9=18. So M =100 -18 +5. 100-18 is 82, plus 5 is 87. Yeah, that's correct.

Now for k, where a is -1 and b is 4. Plugging into M: 4*(-1)^2 minus 2*(4)^2 plus (-1). Let's compute each term. (-1)^2 is 1, so 4*1 is 4. 4 squared is 16, multiplied by 2 is 32. So subtracting 32 from 4 gives -28. Then adding a, which is -1, so -28 + (-1) is -29. So k is -29.

Wait, but plugging in a=-1, let's double-check. M =4*(-1)^2 - 2*(4)^2 + (-1). So 4*(1)=4, 2*(16)=32. So 4 -32 is -28, plus (-1) is -29. Yeah, that's right.

Now, the question asks for j + 2k. So j is 87, k is -29. So 2k is 2*(-29) which is -58. So 87 + (-58) equals 29. Wait, 87 minus 58 is 29? Let me check that subtraction. 58 plus 29 is 87, yes. So 87-58 is 29. So the result is 29.

Looking at the options, option B is 29. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Let's go through each step again.

For j: a=5, b=3.

M =4*(5)^2 -2*(3)^2 +5.

5^2 is 25; 4*25=100.

3^2=9; 2*9=18.

So 100 -18 =82. Plus 5 is 87. Correct.

k: a=-1, b=4.

M=4*(-1)^2 -2*(4)^2 + (-1).

(-1)^2 is 1, so 4*1=4.

4^2 is 16, 2*16=32.

4-32 =-28. Plus (-1) is -29. Correct.

j + 2k =87 + 2*(-29) =87 -58=29.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer is 29, which is option B.

To solve the problem, we start by calculating the value of \( M \) for the given scenarios.

### Step 1: Calculate \( j \) when \( a = 5 \) and \( b = 3 \)
The formula for \( M \) is:
\[
M = 4a^2 - 2b^2 + a
\]
Substituting \( a = 5 \) and \( b = 3 \):
\[
M = 4(5)^2 - 2(3)^2 + 5
\]
\[
M = 4(25) - 2(9) + 5 = 100 - 18 + 5 = 87
\]
Thus, \( j = 87 \).

### Step 2: Calculate \( k \) when \( a = -1 \) and \( b = 4 \)
Substituting \( a = -1 \) and \( b = 4 \):
\[
M = 4(-1)^2 - 2(4)^2 + (-1)
\]
\[
M = 4(1) - 2(16) - 1 = 4 - 32 - 1 = -29
\]
Thus, \( k = -29 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( j + 2k \)
\[
j + 2k = 87 + 2(-29) = 87 - 58 = 29
\]

### Final Answer:
The result is \( 29 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
