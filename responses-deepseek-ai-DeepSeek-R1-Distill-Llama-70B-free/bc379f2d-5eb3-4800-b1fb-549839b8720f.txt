Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that we have 10 grams of argon gas. The initial conditions are a pressure of 608 kPa and a temperature of 300 K. Then, the gas undergoes a change of state at constant internal energy until the final volume is three times the initial volume. We need to find the final state (pressure and temperature) and the entropy change of the gas. The options are from A to J.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. First, I remember that in thermodynamics, internal energy (U) is a state function. For an ideal gas, the internal energy depends only on temperature. Oh wait, right! Because for ideal gases, the internal energy U is a function of temperature alone. So if the process occurs at constant internal energy, that means the temperature must remain constant. Because if U doesn't change, T doesn't change either.

Wait, but wait. Wait, no. Wait a second. Wait, no—wait, no. Wait, because in the problem it says the process is at constant internal energy. So U is constant. Since for ideal gases, U depends only on temperature, that would imply that the temperature doesn't change. So the final temperature should be the same as the initial, which is 300 K. Let me make sure I'm getting that right.

So if U is constant, then ΔU = 0. For an ideal gas, ΔU = n Cv ΔT. Since ΔU is zero, ΔT must be zero, so T_final = T_initial = 300 K.

So looking at the options, any option where the final temperature is 300 K is a candidate. Let's see the options:

Option A: T=300 K. Option E: T=300, F:300, J:300.

Wait, options A, E, F, J have T=300. So the others can be eliminated on that basis.

Now, the next part is about volume. The final volume is three times the initial. So V_final = 3 V_initial. Since pressure and volume are involved, and temperature is constant, this sounds like it's related to Boyle's Law. Boyle's Law states that P V = constant when temperature is constant.

Wait, for an ideal gas, PV = nRT. Since T is constant, n and R are constant, so PV = constant. So if V triples, P must drop by a factor of 3. Because if V3 = 3 V1, then P3 = P1 * (V1 / V3) = P1/3.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, because PV = nRT. So if T is constant, then PV is constant. So if V increases by 3 times, P should decrease to 1/3 of initial.

Wait, initial P is 608 kPa. So P_final should be 608 / 3 = 202.666... kPa. Approximately 202.7 kPa.

Looking at the options, which have P around 202.7 and T=300 K. Let's check:

Option A: 202.7 kPa, 300 K, entropy change +2.286 J/K.

Option E: 608 kPa, 300 K (so pressure same, volume same as initial? No, because volume triples. So E can't be right.)

Option F: 300 kPa, which isn't 202.7, so no. J: 404.3 kPa, which is 608 * 2/3, not 1/3. So J isn't it.

So option A is the only one that fits P=202.7 and T=300.

Wait, but wait. Wait, did I miss anything? Let me make sure.

Wait, but wait, the process is at constant internal energy, which as per earlier, implies constant temperature. So T stays same, so V increases, P drops by factor 3.

So now, the entropy change. Since the process occurs at constant U, we can use the formula for entropy change for an ideal gas.

The formula for entropy change ΔS is given by ΔS = n Cp ln(T2/T1) + n R ln(P1/P2). Or alternatively, since for constant U processes, the work done relates to the pressure and volume changes.

Wait, but when internal energy is constant, for an ideal gas, Q = W, because ΔU = Q - W, so Q = W when ΔU=0.

Wait, but to find entropy change, maybe using the relation for entropy when the process is isothermal? Wait, no, because the temperature isn't changing here. Wait, no, wait, it's not isothermal in terms of heat exchange, but in this case, the temperature is constant because U is constant.

Wait, but no, wait. Because for an ideal gas, if T is constant, then it's an isothermal process. So perhaps the entropy change formula for isothermal processes applies here.

Wait, in an isothermal process, the entropy change is ΔS = n R ln(V2 / V1) because Q = T ΔS, and for isothermal processes, Q = W = n R T ln(V2 / V1), so ΔS = Q_rev / T = n R ln(V2 / V1).

Alternatively, since PV = nRT, and T is constant, so P1 V1 = P2 V2.

Wait, but in our case, the process is at constant U, which for ideal gases implies constant T. So the process is isothermal in terms of T, even though the process is not isothermal in the sense of heat exchange. Wait, no, if T is constant, then it's an isothermal process regardless of the process.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Isothermal process is one where temperature remains constant, regardless of the reason. So yes, in this case, it's an isothermal process.

So the entropy change for an isothermal process is ΔS = n R ln(V2 / V1). Since V2 is 3 V1, ln(3) is about 1.0986.

But wait, the formula can also be written in terms of pressure: since PV = nRT, and T is constant, V2/V1 = P1/P2.

So another way is ΔS = n R ln(P1 / P2).

Either way, we can calculate it.

But wait, I should check whether the process is reversible. Well, the entropy change of the gas depends on the process, but for an ideal gas undergoing any process, the entropy change can be calculated using the formula.

So let's compute n, the number of moles of argon. The mass is 10 grams. Argon has an atomic weight of about 40 g/mol, so moles n = 10 g / 40 g/mol = 0.25 mol.

So n is 0.25.

Now, ΔS = n R ln(V2/V1). V2 is 3 V1, so ln(3) ≈ 1.0986.

So ΔS = 0.25 * R * 1.0986.

R is 8.314 J/mol·K.

Calculating:

0.25 * 8.314 = approx 2.0785.

2.0785 * 1.0986 ≈ 2.0785 * 1.1 ≈ 2.286.

So ΔS ≈ 2.286 J/K.

Looking at the options, option A says entropy change is +2.286 J/K, which matches.

So putting it all together:

Final pressure: 608 / 3 ≈ 202.7 kPa.

Final temperature: 300 K.

Entropy change: +2.286 J/K.

Which is option A.

To solve the problem, we analyze the given conditions and apply thermodynamic principles:

1. **Constant Internal Energy (ΔU = 0):**  
   For an ideal gas, internal energy depends only on temperature. Since the process occurs at constant internal energy, the temperature remains constant. Thus, the final temperature is the same as the initial temperature:  
   \[
   T_{\text{final}} = T_{\text{initial}} = 300 \, \text{K}.
   \]

2. **Volume Change and Pressure:**  
   The final volume is three times the initial volume (\(V_{\text{final}} = 3V_{\text{initial}}\)). Using Boyle's Law (\(PV = \text{constant}\) at constant temperature), the pressure decreases by a factor of 3:  
   \[
   P_{\text{final}} = \frac{P_{\text{initial}}}{3} = \frac{608 \, \text{kPa}}{3} \approx 202.7 \, \text{kPa}.
   \]

3. **Entropy Change (ΔS):**  
   The entropy change for an ideal gas undergoing a process at constant temperature is given by:  
   \[
   \Delta S = nR \ln\left(\frac{V_{\text{final}}}{V_{\text{initial}}}\right),
   \]  
   where \(n\) is the number of moles of gas. The mass of argon is 10 g, and its molar mass is 40 g/mol, so:  
   \[
   n = \frac{10 \, \text{g}}{40 \, \text{g/mol}} = 0.25 \, \text{mol}.
   \]  
   Substituting \(V_{\text{final}} / V_{\text{initial}} = 3\) and \(R = 8.314 \, \text{J/mol·K}\):  
   \[
   \Delta S = 0.25 \cdot 8.314 \cdot \ln(3) \approx 0.25 \cdot 8.314 \cdot 1.0986 \approx 2.286 \, \text{J/K}.
   \]

4. **Final State and Entropy Change:**  
   The final pressure is \(202.7 \, \text{kPa}\), the final temperature is \(300 \, \text{K}\), and the entropy change is \(+2.286 \, \text{J/K}\). Comparing these results with the options, the correct choice is:  
   **Option A: Final pressure is 202.7 kPa, Final temperature is 300 K, Entropy change is +2.286 J/K.**
