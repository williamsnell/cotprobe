Okay, so I have this question about patent law and civil procedure, specifically about securing a jury trial. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

The question says a patent holder is suing a licensee in federal court. The patent holder wants a jury trial because they think the jury would be more sympathetic. So the lawyer needs to know how to secure that right.

I remember that in federal courts, the right to a jury trial is governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, particularly Rule 38. Rule 38 talks about demanding a jury trial. From what I recall, a party has to serve a written demand for a jury trial within a certain timeframe.

Wait, when does this demand need to be made? I think it's related to the pleadings. The pleadings include the complaint, answer, and any counterclaims or replies. So the time limit is tied to when the pleadings are closed, meaning when all the initial pleadings are done.

I believe the rule says that a party must serve a demand for a jury trial within 14 days after the last pleading directed to the issue is served. Or was it 14 days after the close of the pleadings? Or maybe it's a different timeframe, like 60 days?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think. Rule 38(b) states that any party may demand a jury trial by serving the other parties with a written demand—which may be included in the pleading—no later than 14 days after the last pleading directed to the issue is served. And if a party doesn't do this, they've waived their right to a jury trial.

But wait, another part of the rule says that when the action is first set for trial, if no demand has been made, the court may order a jury trial. But I think the key is that the demand has to be made within 14 days after the last pleading is served.

Wait, but the options don't all match that. Let me look at the options.

Option A: File and serve a jury trial demand within 60 days after the close of the pleadings. That seems too long.

Option D: 30 days. Hmm, no, I thought it's 14.

Option J: 14 days after the complaint was served. Wait, that might not be correct because it's after the last pleading, not the complaint.

Wait, the complaint is the initial pleading. Then the defendant files an answer, which is another pleading. So the close of the pleadings would be when all initial pleadings are done. So the last pleading could be an answer or a reply to a counterclaim.

So the 14-day period starts after the last pleading is served. So the demand must be made within 14 days after that.

Looking at the options, option J says within 14 days after the complaint was served. That's too early if the defendant hasn't even answered yet. So that's probably wrong.

Option D is 30 days after the close of the pleadings, which is longer than the 14 days I remember.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing this up with another rule. Let me think again. Rule 38(b) says that the demand must be served within 14 days after the last pleading directed to the issue is served. So the close of the pleadings is when the last pleading is served.

So the correct time is within 14 days after that. So the answer would be the option that says within 14 days after the close of the pleadings. But looking at the options, none of them say that exactly.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option D says within 30 days after the close of the pleadings. Option J is 14 days after the complaint was served. Hmm, no, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps I'm mistaken. Maybe the correct rule is that the demand must be made within 14 days after the last pleading, which is the close of the pleadings. So the time is 14 days from when the pleadings are closed.

Looking back at the options, I don't see an option that exactly says 14 days after the close. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking again. Option J says within 14 days after the complaint was served. No, because the complaint is just the initial step. The answer would come later.

Option D is 30 days after the close of the pleadings. Option A is 60 days.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing this with another rule. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the demand must be made within 14 days after the last pleading, which is the close of the pleadings. So if the options don't have that, perhaps I'm missing the correct option.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D: 30 days after the close. But I thought it was 14 days. Maybe I'm mixing it up with the time for serving the last pleading.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A: 60 days. No, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the initial complaint includes a demand for a jury trial. Like in option I: file and serve a complaint that includes a jury trial demand. That way, the demand is made early on, within the pleadings. So that would satisfy the requirement because the demand is part of the pleading.

But the question is about when the lawyer should act. The patent holder is the plaintiff, so the lawyer could include the demand in the complaint. Alternatively, if the complaint didn't have it, the plaintiff could serve a demand later.

Wait, but the question says the patent holder is bringing the action, so the lawyer would file the complaint. So if the complaint includes a jury demand, that's sufficient. So option I would be correct.

But wait, I thought that the demand could be made later, within 14 days after the last pleading. So if the complaint doesn't include it, you have to demand within 14 days after the answer is filed.

Hmm, now I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to clarify.

Rule 38(b) says that any party may demand a jury trial by: (1) serving the other parties with a written demand—which may be included in a pleading—no later than 14 days after the last pleading directed to the issue is served, or (2) filing a demand in accordance with Rule 5(d).

So the demand can be made in a pleading, such as the complaint, or served later within 14 days after the last pleading.

If the lawyer files the complaint with a jury demand, that's sufficient because it's part of a pleading. So in that case, the correct action would be option I.

Alternatively, if the complaint doesn't include it, then the demand must be made within 14 days after the last pleading.

But in this question, the patent holder is the plaintiff, so the lawyer is drafting the complaint. So the lawyer can include the demand in the complaint, which would satisfy the requirement, making option I correct.

But wait, another thought: in some cases, the complaint might not include the demand, and the plaintiff could later serve a demand. So if the complaint doesn't have it, the plaintiff must serve a demand within 14 days after the answer is filed (the last pleading).

But the question is about what the lawyer should do to secure the right. So the safest way is to include it in the complaint, which ensures that the demand is timely made. So option I is correct.

Alternatively, if the complaint doesn't include it, the lawyer can serve a demand within 14 days after the last pleading. But looking at the options, none have that. The options are A:60 days, D:30, J:14 after complaint.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong earlier, and the correct answer is D: within 30 days after the close of the pleadings. But that doesn't align with what I remember.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing state rules with federal rules. In federal court, it's 14 days after the last pleading. So if the last pleading is the answer, then the demand must be served within 14 days.

So if the plaintiff is the one bringing the action, the complaint is their pleading. The defendant will file an answer. Once the answer is filed, the pleadings are closed. So the plaintiff must serve a jury demand within 14 days after the answer is served.

But in the options, I don't see an option that says within 14 days after the answer is served. So perhaps the correct answer is D:30 days after the close of the pleadings, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the correct answer is A: within 60 days. No, that's too long.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options again.

Option I says to file a complaint that includes a jury trial demand. That would satisfy the requirement because the demand is part of a pleading, so it's timely made. So if the lawyer includes it in the complaint, the demand is made, and the right is preserved.

Alternatively, if the complaint doesn't include it, the lawyer must serve a demand within 14 days after the last pleading. So if the complaint doesn't have it, then within 14 days after the answer is filed, the lawyer must serve a demand.

But the question is about what the lawyer should do to secure the right. So if the lawyer includes it in the complaint, that's the easiest way. So option I is correct.

Wait, but another point: under Rule 38, the demand must be served, not just filed. So just including it in the complaint may not be enough unless it's served on the other parties.

Wait, when you file the complaint, you have to serve it on the defendant. So including the demand in the complaint and serving it would satisfy the serving requirement.

So yes, option I would be correct because the complaint includes the demand and is served on the defendant.

Alternatively, if the complaint doesn't include it, the lawyer has to serve a separate demand within 14 days after the last pleading.

But in the scenario, the lawyer is acting now to secure the right, so including it in the complaint (option I) would be the way to go.

Wait, but looking back, the options include option J: within 14 days after the complaint was served. That would be too early because the defendant hasn't answered yet. So the 14 days after the complaint doesn't make sense because the pleadings aren't closed yet.

So, the correct approach is to include the demand in the complaint. Thus, option I is the correct answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought the demand could be made within 14 days after the last pleading. So if the complaint didn't have it, the lawyer could file a demand later, but that's not one of the options except perhaps J, but J's timing is wrong.

So, given the options, the best choice is I: file and serve a complaint that includes a jury trial demand.

To secure the patent holder's right to a jury trial in federal court, the lawyer must comply with the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 38. Under this rule, a party may demand a jury trial by including the demand in a pleading or by serving a separate written demand. The demand must be made no later than 14 days after the close of the pleadings, which is when all initial pleadings (such as the complaint, answer, and any counterclaims or replies) are completed.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: "File and serve a jury trial demand within 60 days after the close of the pleadings." This is incorrect because the demand must be made within 14 days after the close of the pleadings, not 60 days.
- **Option B**: "File and serve a jury trial demand at the close of discovery." This is incorrect because the demand must be made within 14 days after the close of the pleadings, which occurs much earlier than the close of discovery.
- **Option C**: "Submit a jury trial demand by email to the judge's office." This is incorrect because the demand must be formally filed and served on all parties, not merely submitted by email to the judge.
- **Option D**: "File and serve a jury trial demand within 30 days after the close of the pleadings." This is incorrect because the demand must be made within 14 days after the close of the pleadings, not 30 days.
- **Option E**: "File and serve a jury trial demand at the initial court hearing." This is incorrect because the demand must be tied to the close of the pleadings, not a court hearing.
- **Option F**: "File and serve a complaint that excludes a jury trial demand." This is incorrect because excluding the demand would result in waiver of the right to a jury trial.
- **Option G**: "Make a verbal request for a jury trial during the first court hearing." This is incorrect because a verbal request is insufficient; the demand must be in writing.
- **Option H**: "Make a jury trial demand at the initial pretrial conference." This is incorrect because the demand must be made within 14 days after the close of the pleadings, which occurs before the pretrial conference.
- **Option I**: "File and serve a complaint that includes a jury trial demand." This is correct because including the demand in the complaint satisfies the requirement, as the complaint is a pleading and is served on the defendant.
- **Option J**: "File and serve a jury trial demand within 14 days after the complaint was served." This is incorrect because the 14-day period runs from the close of the pleadings (after the answer or other pleadings are filed), not from the service of the complaint.

The best course of action for the lawyer is to include the jury trial demand in the complaint, as this ensures the demand is timely and properly made. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**I**
