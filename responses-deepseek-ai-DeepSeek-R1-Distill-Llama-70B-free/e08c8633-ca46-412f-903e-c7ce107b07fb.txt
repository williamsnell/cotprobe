Okay, so I have this problem about the Lyman series of hydrogen, and I need to find the original energy level of the electron. Hmm, I remember that the Lyman series is one of the series in the hydrogen spectrum, right? It's the series where the electrons transition to the n=1 energy level. So that's the first energy level, which is the ground state. 

The given wavelength is 1.03 × 10^-7 meters. Wait, I think the Lyman series is in the ultraviolet region because the transitions end at n=1. So the wavelengths are pretty short. Let me think about the Rydberg formula. It's used to calculate the wavelength of the spectral lines.

The Rydberg formula is 1/λ = R * (1/(n1)^2 - 1/(n2)^2), where n1 is the lower energy level and n2 is the higher one. Since we're talking about the Lyman series, n1 is 1 because the electron falls to that level. So n1 = 1. Now, n2 would be the higher level the electron was originally in. So we're solving for n2 here.

Plugging in the values, I have 1/λ = R * (1/1^2 - 1/(n2)^2). The Rydberg constant R is approximately 1.097 × 10^7 m^-1. Let me rearrange the formula to solve for n2.

So the formula becomes 1/λ = R*(1 - 1/(n2)^2). Let me plug in the numbers. The wavelength λ is 1.03e-7 meters. So 1 divided by that is approximately 9.708 × 10^6 m^-1. Let me write that as 9.708e6.

So 9.708e6 = 1.097e7 * (1 - 1/(n2)^2). Hmm, solving for (1 - 1/(n2)^2) gives me (9.708e6) / (1.097e7). Let me compute that division. 9.708e6 divided by 1.097e7 is approximately 0.885. 

So 0.885 = 1 - 1/(n2)^2. Rearranging, 1/(n2)^2 = 1 - 0.885 = 0.115. Taking reciprocal, (n2)^2 = 1 / 0.115 ≈ 8.695. Taking square root gives n2 ≈ sqrt(8.695) ≈ 2.95. Wait, but n has to be an integer. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because 2.95 is close to 3, but maybe I made a calculation error.

Wait, let's double-check the numbers. The given wavelength is 1.03e-7 m. So 1/λ is 1/(1.03e-7) = approx 9.708e6 m^-1. Rydberg is 1.097e7 m^-1. So 9.708e6 / 1.097e7 = Let me do this division more accurately. 9.708e6 divided by 1.097e7 is the same as (9.708 / 10.97) ≈ 0.885, yes. So that part is correct.

So 0.885 = 1 - 1/(n2)^2 → 1/(n2)^2 = 0.115 → n2² ≈ 8.695. Square root is about 2.95. Hmm, but that's not an integer. Did I do something wrong? Because energy levels are integers, right?

Wait, maybe I mixed up n1 and n2. In the Lyman series, the transition is from higher n (n2) to lower n (n1=1). So the formula should be 1/λ = R (1/(n1)^2 - 1/(n2)^2), but wait, no, because when the electron falls to a lower level, n2 is higher than n1. So the correct formula is 1/λ = R (1/(n1)^2 - 1/(n2)^2). But since n1 is 1, that's 1/λ = R (1 - 1/(n2)^2). That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate 9.708e6 divided by 1.097e7. Let me compute that more precisely. 9.708e6 is 9,708,000. 1.097e7 is 10,970,000. So 9,708,000 / 10,970,000 ≈ 0.885. So that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the given wavelength is in the Lyman series, and perhaps the transition is from n=3 to n=1. Let's check for n=3. What would 1/λ be? Let's compute 1.097e7 (1/1^2 - 1/3^2) = 1.097e7 (1 - 1/9) = 1.097e7 * (8/9) ≈ 1.097e7 * 0.8889 ≈ 9.75e6 m^-1. Which would correspond to λ ≈ 1/(9.75e6) ≈ 1.026e-7 m, which is 1.026 × 10^-7 m, which is close to the given 1.03e-7 m.

Wait, the given wavelength is 1.03e-7, which is a bit longer than 1.026e-7. So the 1/λ would be slightly smaller than 9.75e6, which would mean (1 - 1/(n2)^2) is a bit less than 0.8889, so 1/(n2)^2 is a bit more than 0.1111 (which is 1/9). So n2^2 would be a bit less than 9, making n2 a bit less than 3. But n must be integer, so perhaps the correct transition is n=3 to n=1, making the wavelength about 1.026e-7 m, which is close to 1.03e-7. So the original energy level is n=3.

Wait, but the given wavelength is 1.03e-7, which is a bit longer than 1.026e-7. So a longer wavelength (smaller 1/λ) would imply a smaller value on the right side, so 1 - 1/(n2)^2 is a bit smaller than 0.8889, so 1/(n2)^2 is a bit larger than 0.1111. For example, let me compute 1/(n2)^2 = 1 - (9.708e6)/(1.097e7).

Wait, let me compute 9.708e6 / 1.097e7 accurately. Let me compute 9708000 / 10970000. Let's see: 10970000 × 0.885 is approximately 9707950, which is close to 9708000. So the ratio is about 0.885.

So 1/(n2)^2 = 1 - 0.885 = 0.115. So n2^2 = 8.69565. So n2 is sqrt(8.69565) ≈ 2.948, which is about 2.95. Hmm, but that's not an integer. So perhaps the correct n is 3, and the slight discrepancy is due to approximation in the Rydberg constant or rounding in the wavelength.

Wait, but let's compute for n=3 and n=4. For n=3, the wavelength is about 1.026e-7 m. For n=4, 1/(n2)^2 would be 1 - (9.708e6)/(1.097e7) = 0.115 → n2^2 = 8.695 → n2≈2.95, which is between 2 and 3. But n must be integer, so perhaps the calculation is off, or the given wavelength is for a different transition.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the Rydberg formula. Oh wait, another thought: sometimes, the Rydberg formula is written with a different sign. Let me double-check. The correct formula is 1/λ = R*(1/(n1)^2 - 1/(n2)^2), where n2 > n1. So for emission (which the Lyman series is), it's from higher to lower, so n2 is the initial higher state, and n1=1.

So perhaps the given wavelength is for a transition from n=3 to n=1, making the original energy level n=3.

Looking at the options, J is 3. So the correct answer should be J.

To determine the original energy level of the electron in the Lyman series of hydrogen, we use the Rydberg formula:

\[
\frac{1}{\lambda} = R \left( \frac{1}{n_1^2} - \frac{1}{n_2^2} \right),
\]

where \( n_1 = 1 \) (since the Lyman series involves transitions to the \( n=1 \) energy level), \( R \) is the Rydberg constant (\( 1.097 \times 10^7 \, \mathrm{m}^{-1} \)), and \( \lambda \) is the given wavelength (\( 1.03 \times 10^{-7} \, \mathrm{m} \)).

### Step 1: Solve for \( \frac{1}{n_2^2} \)
Rearranging the formula:

\[
\frac{1}{n_2^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{R \lambda}.
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\frac{1}{n_2^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{(1.097 \times 10^7)(1.03 \times 10^{-7})}.
\]

First, calculate \( R \lambda \):

\[
R \lambda = (1.097 \times 10^7)(1.03 \times 10^{-7}) \approx 1.129.
\]

Now, calculate \( \frac{1}{R \lambda} \):

\[
\frac{1}{R \lambda} \approx \frac{1}{1.129} \approx 0.885.
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{1}{n_2^2} = 1 - 0.885 = 0.115.
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \( n_2 \)
Taking the reciprocal:

\[
n_2^2 = \frac{1}{0.115} \approx 8.695.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
n_2 \approx \sqrt{8.695} \approx 2.95.
\]

Since \( n_2 \) must be an integer, the closest value is \( n_2 = 3 \).

### Step 3: Verify the result
For \( n_2 = 3 \), calculate the wavelength:

\[
\frac{1}{\lambda} = R \left( \frac{1}{1^2} - \frac{1}{3^2} \right) = 1.097 \times 10^7 \left( 1 - \frac{1}{9} \right) = 1.097 \times 10^7 \times \frac{8}{9} \approx 9.75 \times 10^6 \, \mathrm{m}^{-1}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{1}{9.75 \times 10^6} \approx 1.026 \times 10^{-7} \, \mathrm{m}.
\]

This is very close to the given wavelength (\( 1.03 \times 10^{-7} \, \mathrm{m} \)), confirming that \( n_2 = 3 \) is correct.

### Final Answer
The original energy level of the electron is \( n = 3 \).
