Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a fishbowl made from a sphere. Let me try to understand what's going on. The fishbowl's height is 4r/3, and the sphere has a radius r=6. So I guess the original sphere's height is 2r, which would be 12 units. But when we remove the top third, the fishbowl's height becomes 4r/3. Let's calculate that: 4*6/3 is 8. So the fishbowl is 8 units tall.

Wait, no, wait. The problem says the fishbowl is formed by removing the top third. So the original sphere's height is 12 (since radius is 6, diameter is 12). Removing the top third would leave two-thirds as the height. Oh wait, so 2/3 of 12 is 8. So yes, that's correct. The fishbowl's height is 8 units.

The marble is at the bottom of this fishbowl. The setup is that the fishbowl is fixed so its rim is parallel to the ground. The marble is given some initial velocity, and I need to find the maximum velocity so that it lands back in the bowl. All surfaces are frictionless, and air resistance is ignored, so it's a problem involving conservation of energy and maybe projectile motion.

Hmm, so the marble is going to be launched and then come back. The maximum initial velocity probably corresponds to the case where the marble just barely makes it back into the bowl. I think this would involve the marble following a trajectory that just touches the rim of the fishbowl on its way back down.

Let me think about the setup. The fishbowl is part of a sphere. So the inside of the fishbowl is like a spherical cap. The marble is moving in this cap, so when it's projected, its path would be along the inner surface.

Wait, but the fishbowl is fixed. So maybe the marble's motion is constrained to move within the bowl, perhaps sliding without friction. But if that's the case, then the problem would be about the marble moving up the bowl's sides and back.

Alternatively, perhaps the marble is projected at some angle, and it's a projectile motion problem where the marble would go into a parabolic path but must land back into the bowl.

Wait, but the problem says the surfaces are frictionless. So if the marble is on the inside of the bowl, which is a part of a sphere, when it's given a velocity, it would slide up the sides. Since there's no friction, it would go up to some height and come back. But wait, if the bowl is fixed, maybe the marble's motion is along the spherical surface.

Hmm, but the question is about the marble landing back in the bowl when launched. So perhaps it's a projectile motion problem where the marble is launched from the bottom, goes in a parabolic path, and just reaches the rim upon returning.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as projectile motion. The maximum initial velocity would be such that the marble just reaches the top of the fishbowl's rim as it comes back down. So the trajectory would have to reach a point where it's at the height of the rim, and the horizontal distance would be zero (since it's returning to the starting point).

Wait, but the fishbowl is a spherical cap. So the bottom of the fishbowl is at the original sphere's bottom (assuming the sphere was cut from the top). So the center of the sphere would be at a distance of r=6 from the bottom. So the fishbowl's rim is at height 8, as earlier. The sphere's original center was at 6 units from the bottom, so the fishbowl's rim is 8 units high, which is 2 units above the center. So the fishbowl's rim is at a point where the sphere's radius is 6, and the height is 8. So the radius of the fishbowl's rim in terms of the sphere's geometry might be important.

Wait, perhaps using energy conservation could help. The marble starts at the bottom with some kinetic energy, which converts to potential energy at the highest point. But I'm not sure if the highest point is the rim of the bowl or beyond.

Alternatively, maybe the maximum initial velocity is such that the marble just reaches the top of the fishbowl when it's projected. So when it goes up, it just gets to the rim without going over. So using energy conservation, the kinetic energy at the bottom would convert to potential energy at the rim.

Wait, but the fishbowl is a section of a sphere. So the potential energy at the rim would be higher than at the bottom. Let me calculate the potential energy difference between the bottom and the rim.

The bottom of the fishbowl is at a certain point in the sphere. The sphere's center is at 6 units from the bottom. So the bottom of the fishbowl is at a height of 0 (if we take the bottom as the reference point), and the center is at 6 units, and the rim is at 8 units. So the vertical distance from the bottom to the rim is 8 units.

Wait, no. Let me think. The sphere has radius 6. The fishbowl is formed by cutting off the top third. So the height of the fishbowl is two-thirds of the sphere's diameter, which is 8 units. The sphere's center is at 6 units from the bottom, so the rim is at 8 units, which is 2 units above the center.

So the potential energy at the rim would be mgh, where h is 8 units. Wait, but if the marble is at the bottom, its initial kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², which would convert to mgh as it reaches the top. So equating the two:

(1/2)mv² = mg(8)

Wait, but that can't be right because the marble would just go up 8 units, but in the context of a sphere, maybe the actual height isn't 8 units. Wait, no, in this scenario, the fishbowl's height is 8 units, so the marble would need to go up 8 units vertically from the bottom to reach the rim.

But wait, that seems too simplistic because the fishbowl's shape is curved. So the marble isn't just moving straight up; it's moving along the inside surface. So perhaps energy conservation is more about the change in height from the bottom to the top point on the sphere.

Wait, if the fishbowl is a spherical cap of height h_cap = 8, then the radius of the sphere is r=6. The formula for the radius of the spherical cap (a) is a = sqrt(r² - (r - h_cap)²). Let me compute that:

a = sqrt(6² - (6 - 8)^2) → but wait, 6-8 is -2, squared is 4. So a = sqrt(36 - 4) = sqrt(32) = 4√2 ≈5.656 units.

So the radius of the rim of the fishbowl is about 5.656 units. So the marble starts at the bottom and moves up along the spherical surface. The maximum height it can reach would be when all kinetic energy is converted into potential energy.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider the geometry. The marble starts at the lowest point of the fishbowl. When it's given a velocity, it moves along the spherical surface. The maximum velocity would be when it just reaches the highest point of the fishbowl, which is the rim.

Wait, but in that case, the potential energy at the rim would be higher than at the bottom. Let me compute the vertical height difference. The bottom of the fishbowl is at the original sphere's bottom, which is at a depth of 6 units from the center. The rim is at 8 units from the bottom. So the center is at 6 units above the bottom, so the rim is 8 units above the bottom. So the vertical height from the bottom to the rim is 8 units.

Wait, but that can't be because the sphere's radius is 6 units, so the center is at 6 units from the bottom. So the top of the sphere would be 12 units from the bottom, but the fishbowl is only 8 units tall, so the rim is 8 units above the bottom. So the vertical height the marble would climb is 8 units.

So using energy conservation: the kinetic energy at the bottom converts to potential energy at the top.

So (1/2) m v² = m g h.

Here, h would be 8 meters. So solving for v:

v = sqrt(2gh) = sqrt(2 * 9.8 *8) = sqrt(156.8) ≈12.52 m/s.

Wait, but that's not one of the options. The options are A:20.5, etc. So I must have made a mistake.

Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. Perhaps the marble isn't just moving vertically up, but is instead launched at some angle, so it's a projectile that goes up and comes back down into the bowl.

Wait, but in that case, the maximum initial speed would be determined by the marble's trajectory just reaching the rim's height as it returns.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as projectile motion. The marble is launched with some speed v at an angle theta. The maximum height it reaches is when the vertical component of the velocity is zero.

But to land back in the bowl, the marble's path must stay within the bowl's boundaries. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum speed is when the marble just reaches the top of the bowl upon returning.

Wait, but if the fishbowl's shape is a sphere, maybe the marble's path is constrained to the sphere's inner surface. So when it's given a velocity, it will move along the sphere's surface, converting kinetic energy into potential energy.

Wait, but the fishbowl is fixed, so maybe the marble is moving along the inner surface. So the maximum initial velocity would be when the marble just reaches the top of the bowl.

In that case, the initial kinetic energy is converted into potential energy, with the change in height being the vertical distance from the bottom to the top of the bowl.

Wait, but earlier calculation gave v ≈12.52, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the marble is not moving along the surface but is instead a projectile in the air. So when it's launched, it goes into a parabolic trajectory, and the condition is that it lands back into the fishbowl. So the maximum initial speed would be such that the highest point of the trajectory is exactly at the rim of the fishbowl.

Wait, but the fishbowl's rim is a certain height above the starting point. If the fishbowl is 8 units tall, then the maximum height the marble can reach is 8 units above the starting point. So in projectile motion, the maximum height H is given by (v² sin²θ)/(2g). To maximize H, theta is 90 degrees, so H = v²/(2g). So if the maximum height is 8 meters, then v = sqrt(2gH) = sqrt(2*9.8*8) ≈12.52 m/s, same as before.

But that's still not matching any of the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the height wrong. The fishbowl's height is 4r/3, which is 8 when r=6. But the vertical height from the starting point to the rim is not 8 units. Wait, because the fishbowl is a spherical cap. So the starting point is at the very bottom, which is a distance r from the center. The rim of the fishbowl is at a height of h above the bottom, which in this case is 8 units. Wait, but the sphere's radius is 6, so the center is at 6 units above the bottom. So the rim is 8 units above the bottom, which is 2 units above the center. So the vertical height is indeed 8 units.

But again, that gives v≈12.5, which isn't an option. So I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the fishbowl is a section of the sphere, but the marble isn't just moving vertically. Maybe it's moving along the spherical path, so the actual height it reaches is more than 8 units. Wait, that can't be because the fishbowl's height is 8. So maybe the marble's path is along the spherical surface, so when it's given some velocity, it slides up the inside, and the maximum initial speed is such that it just reaches the top of the bowl.

In that case, the initial kinetic energy is converted into potential energy, but the potential energy depends on how high the marble rises along the sphere.

Wait, the fishbowl is a spherical cap of height h_cap = 4r/3 = 8 units. The radius of the base of the cap (a) is given by a = sqrt(2rh_cap - h_cap²). Let me compute that.

r=6, h_cap=8.

a = sqrt(2*6*8 - 8²) = sqrt(96 -64) = sqrt(32) = 4√2 ≈5.656 m.

So the radius of the rim is about 5.656 meters.

The marble starts at the center of the base, which is the lowest point. When it moves to the rim, it's moving along the spherical surface. So the change in height isn't just 8 meters, because the marble's path is along the sphere's surface, so the vertical elevation would be less than 8 meters. Wait, no, the fishbowl's height is 8, so the vertical elevation from the bottom to the rim is 8 meters.

Wait, but in terms of energy, the marble's change in potential energy is mgh, where h is 8. So the initial kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², which equals mgh.

So solving for v gives v = sqrt(2gh) = sqrt(2*9.8*8) ≈12.52 m/s. But the options don't include that. So I must have made a wrong assumption.

Wait, maybe the marble is moving in a circular path inside the bowl. So the maximum speed it can have without flying out is determined by the condition that the centripetal force equals the component of gravity. But that doesn't involve projectile motion, but rather circular motion.

But the question says the marble is to land back in the bowl, implying projectile motion outside the bowl. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the marble is projected at an angle such that when it comes back down, it's at the same horizontal level as the starting point but within the bowl's rim.

Wait, the maximum initial speed would correspond to the case where the marble just reaches the highest point of the fishbowl upon returning. So perhaps the maximum height of the projectile is equal to the fishbowl's rim height.

So maximum height H = (v² sin²θ)/(2g). To maximize H, theta is 90 degrees, so H = v²/(2g). Setting H equal to 8 meters, v = sqrt(2gH) = sqrt(2*9.8*8) ≈12.52 m/s. Again, not matching the options.

Wait, but perhaps the marble's trajectory must stay within the fishbowl. Since the fishbowl is a section of a sphere, the marble's path can't go outside the sphere's surface. So the maximum initial velocity would be when the projectile's path just touches the rim of the fishbowl.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as the marble being projected from the origin (the center of the fishbowl's base) with velocity v at some angle theta. The trajectory is a parabola. The fishbowl's rim is a circle of radius a =4√2 ≈5.656 m, at a height of 8 m.

Wait, but the fishbowl's rim is a circle in 3D, but in the 2D cross-section, it's a point at (0,8). So the projectile's path must not go beyond the sphere's surface.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum initial velocity is such that the projectile just reaches the rim, which is at (a,8), where a is the radius of the rim.

Wait, but that complicates things because the projectile would have to reach a horizontal distance of a while having a vertical position of 8 m. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the fishbowl's shape is a hemisphere. Wait, no, the height is 8, which is more than a hemisphere of radius 6 (which would have height 6). So it's a larger cap.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the marble's motion as constrained within the sphere. So when it's given a velocity, it moves along the inner surface, and the maximum speed is when it just reaches the top.

In that case, the initial kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², which converts to potential energy mgh, where h is the vertical height from the bottom to the top of the fishbowl, which is 8 m. So again, v = sqrt(2gh) ≈12.52 m/s. But again, the options don't have this.

Looking at the options, the closest is option I: 17.0, which is higher than 12.5, or option C:16.4. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the height. Let me think again about the fishbowl's geometry.

The fishbowl is a spherical cap of height h_cap = 8 m, made from a sphere of radius r=6 m. Wait, but wait, that's impossible because the height of a spherical cap can't exceed the diameter. Wait, no, because the sphere's radius is 6, so the maximum height of the cap would be 12 m (the whole sphere). So a cap height of 8 m is possible.

Wait, but wait, when you cut a sphere, the height of the cap can't exceed the diameter. So h_cap can be up to 12 m. So 8 m is acceptable.

Wait, but the formula for the radius of the cap is a = sqrt(2rh - h²), where h is the height of the cap. So with h=8, r=6:

a = sqrt(2*6*8 -8²) = sqrt(96 -64) = sqrt(32) =4√2 ≈5.656 m.

So the radius of the rim is about 5.656 m.

Now, if the marble is projected from the center of the base (the lowest point), and needs to just reach the rim, which is 5.656 m away horizontally and 8 m up. So the projectile's path must reach the point (5.656,8) in a parabolic trajectory.

So the marble is launched with initial velocity v at some angle theta. The equations of motion are:

Horizontal: x = v_x t = v cosθ * t

Vertical: y = v sinθ
