Okay, so I've got this problem about Leo's Restaurant purchasing a neon sign, and I need to figure out how much they paid. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the problem states that the sign was bought on July 1 for $202 with discount terms (3/10), (n/30) R.O.G. Hmm, I remember that in accounting, terms like these indicate the payment terms, including discounts for early payment.

Wait, what does (3/10), (n/30) R.O.G. mean? Oh right, R.O.G. stands for "receipt of goods," so the discount period starts when the goods are received, not when the invoice is dated. So the sign was delivered on July 12, which is when the 30-day period starts. That makes sense because R.O.G. affects when the discount period begins.

So the invoice date is July 1, but the delivery is July 12. The payment was made on July 20. I need to calculate whether this payment qualifies for the discount and, if so, how much the amount paid would be.

The terms are 3/10, n/30. That means a 3% discount if paid within 10 days of receiving the goods, otherwise, the net is due in 30 days. Since the goods were received on July 12, the 10-day discount period would end on July 22 (July 12 + 10 days is July 22). But the payment was made on July 20, which is within that 10-day window, so they get the discount.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check the dates. July 12 is day 0. So day 1 is July 13, up to day 10 being July 22. So payment on July 20 is day 8, which is within the discount period. So yes, the discount applies.

Now, the discount is 3% of the invoice amount. The invoice is $202. So 3% of 202 is 0.03 * 202 = let me calculate that. 0.03 * 200 is 6, and 0.03 *2 is 0.06, so total is 6.06. So the discount is $6.06.

Subtracting that from the invoice price: 202 - 6.06 = 195.94. So the amount paid should be $195.94.

Looking at the options, option B is $195.94. But wait, I should make sure I didn't miss anything else. Are there any other charges or considerations? The problem doesn't mention any, so I think that's the correct amount.

The problem involves calculating the amount paid by Leo's Restaurant for a neon sign purchased under specific discount terms. The invoice amount is $202, with terms (3/10), (n/30) R.O.G., meaning a 3% discount is available if payment is made within 10 days of receiving the goods, and the net amount is due within 30 days. 

Key details:
- The invoice date is July 1, but the goods were delivered on July 12, which is when the 10-day discount period begins.
- Payment was made on July 20, which falls within the 10-day window (July 12 to July 22).
- The discount is 3% of $202, calculated as $6.06.
- Subtracting the discount from the invoice amount gives $202 - $6.06 = $195.94.

Thus, the amount paid is $195.94, corresponding to option B.
