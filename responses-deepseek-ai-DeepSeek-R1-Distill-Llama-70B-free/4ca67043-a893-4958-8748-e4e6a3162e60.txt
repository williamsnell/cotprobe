C: Statement 1 is False, but it's not clear about Statement 2
D: False, True
E: Statement 1 is True, but it's not clear about Statement 2
F: True, True
G: Statement 2 is False, but it's not clear about Statement 1
H: True, False
I: Both Statements are unclear
J: False, False

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question, and I need to figure out which of the options A through J is correct. The question presents two statements, and I need to evaluate their truthfulness.

Let's start with Statement 1: "Layer Normalization is used in the original ResNet paper, not Batch Normalization." I remember that ResNet was a significant paper in deep learning, especially for handling vanishing gradients with residual connections. From what I've read before, ResNet uses Batch Normalization. Wait, but sometimes people confuse Layer Normalization with Batch Normalization. Oh right, Layer Normalization is typically used in recurrent neural networks, like LSTMs, because it normalizes across the features for each sample. Batch Normalization, on the other hand, normalizes across the batch dimension and is more commonly used in convolutional neural networks. So the original ResNet paper would have used Batch Normalization, not Layer. So Statement 1 is actually false. That means Statement 1 is incorrect.

Now, Statement 2 says, "DCGANs use self-attention to stabilize training." DCGANs, or Deep Convolutional GANs, are a type of Generative Adversarial Network. I recall that DCGANs introduced several techniques like using convolutional layers without fully connected layers, using batch normalization, and maybe some other normalization techniques. But do they use self-attention? I'm pretty sure self-attention mechanisms became popular later, especially with the Transformer architecture in papers like "Attention Is All You Need." DCGANs were introduced before that, so I don't think they used self-attention. So Statement 2 is false.

Putting it together: Statement 1 is false and Statement 2 is false. So looking at the options, which option corresponds to both being false?

Looking at the options, option J is "False, False." So the correct answer would be option J.

The correct answer is option J, as both statements are false.
