Alright, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about signal sampling and time-division multiplexing. Okay, let's break it down step by step.

The question states that 2000 signals are being sampled at the Nyquist rate by a sampling function S(t). The function is given as an infinite sum of impulses, each spaced at intervals of 1/f_s, where f_s is the sampling rate. After sampling, the signals are time-division multiplexed. Each signal has a bandwidth of 5 kHz. I need to calculate the sampling time T_s and determine tau_max, which is the maximum pulse duration for the stretched impulses.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. So, first, let's recall some concepts.

Nyquist rate is the minimum sampling rate required to accurately capture a signal. The formula for Nyquist rate is f_s = 2 * B, where B is the bandwidth of the signal. Oh wait, right, because you need to sample at least twice the highest frequency present in the signal to avoid aliasing.

Each signal has a bandwidth of 5 kHz, which is 5000 Hz. So the Nyquist rate for each signal would be 2 * 5000 = 10,000 Hz. That means the sampling rate f_s is 10,000 samples per second.

Wait, but wait a second. Are they sampling each signal at the Nyquist rate, or is the overall system's sampling rate something else? Oh, the question says that the signals are sampled at the Nyquist rate. So each signal is sampled at 10 kHz. But then there are 2000 such signals. Hmm.

Wait, no. I think I'm getting this wrong. Wait, each individual signal is being sampled at its own Nyquist rate. So each signal is sampled at 2*5 kHz = 10 kHz. But since there are 2000 signals, how does that affect the total sampling?

Wait no, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The sampling function S(t) is a sum of impulses spaced at 1/f_s. So the sampling rate for the entire system is f_s. But each individual signal is being sampled at the Nyquist rate, which is 2*B. So the individual signals are being sampled at 10 kHz each. But that would imply that each signal contributes 10,000 samples per second.

But wait, time-division multiplexing (TDM) works by interleaving samples from different signals. So if we have N signals each sampled at f_s, then the total sampling rate needed for the TDM system would be N multiplied by the individual sampling rate. Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the system's sampling rate is such that each of the 2000 signals is sampled at the Nyquist rate, so the total would be 2000 times 10,000 samples per second.

Wait no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. The sampling function S(t) is the same for all signals. So all 2000 signals are being sampled at the same rate f_s. But each signal's bandwidth is 5 kHz, so f_s must be at least 10 kHz for each. So the overall f_s is 10 kHz.

Wait, but if each of the 2000 signals is being sampled at 10 kHz, then the total number of samples per second in the TDM system is 2000 * 10,000 = 20,000,000 samples per second. But that's the total sampling rate.

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing concepts here. Let's clarify.

In TDM, each signal is sampled in a periodic manner. Each signal's sample is taken at intervals, and the samples from all signals are interleaved to form the composite signal.

So the overall sampling rate is N times the individual sampling rate, where N is the number of signals. But wait, that's not correct. Because each signal is sampled at f_s, and in TDM, each signal is sampled once every T period, where T is the frame period. Hmm, perhaps it's better to model it as each signal being sampled once per frame, and the frame is repeated every T, with T being the total time to sample all N signals.

Wait, maybe I should model the problem differently. Let's say that each signal is sampled at a rate of f_s, which must be at least the Nyquist rate 2B. So for each signal, f_s >= 10 kHz.

But since all 2000 signals are being sampled and TDM'ed, the total number of samples per second in the system is 2000 * f_s. Because each of the 2000 signals contributes f_s samples per second.

Wait, that doesn't sound right. Because in TDM, the samples are taken one after another. So for each signal, the time between samples (the sampling interval) is T_s = 1/f_s. But because there are N signals, each signal is only sampled once every N*T_s time. So the effective sampling rate per signal is f_s / N.

Wait, that makes more sense. Because in TDM, each signal is sampled, then the next, and so on. So for each signal, the time between its samples is N*T_s. Therefore, the effective sampling rate per signal is 1/(N*T_s) = f_s / N.

But each signal must be sampled at least at the Nyquist rate, which is 2B. So for each signal, f_s / N >= 2B. Therefore, f_s >= 2B * N.

Wait, that seems more accurate. Because if each signal is being sampled every N*T_s seconds, then their effective sampling rate is 1/(N*T_s) = (f_s)/N. So to satisfy Nyquist, (f_s)/N >= 2B.

So f_s >= 2B*N.

But wait, B is 5 kHz for each signal, N is 2000. So f_s >= 2 * 5000 Hz * 2000 = 20,000,000 Hz. So 20 million samples per second. So f_s = 20e6 Hz. So T_s is 1/f_s = 5e-8 seconds?

Wait, that can't be right because the options don't have that. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is different. Let me think again.

The question says that each signal is sampled at Nyquist rate. So each signal is sampled at 2B, which is 10 kHz. So each signal's sampling rate is 10 kHz.

But in TDM, if you have 2000 such signals, each requiring 10 kHz, the total bit rate (samples per second) is 2000 * 10 kHz = 20 MHz, so 20,000,000 samples per second. Thus, the overall sampling rate f_s would be 20 MHz.

Wait, but wait. The sampling function S(t) has a period of 1/f_s. So the sampling time T_s is 1/f_s. So if f_s is 20e6 Hz, T_s is 5e-8 seconds, which is 50 nanoseconds.

But looking at the options, none of the options have T_s as 5e-8. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read the question again.

Wait, the question says that each signal has a bandwidth of 5 kHz. So Nyquist rate is 10 kHz. But then, perhaps the overall system's sampling rate is such that each signal is sampled at 10 kHz. So the total number of samples per second is 2000 * 10,000 = 2e7, which is 20 MHz. So f_s is 20 MHz, T_s is 1/20e6 = 5e-8 seconds, 50 ns.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the question is that all 2000 signals are being time-division multiplexed, each sampled at their Nyquist rate. So the overall TDM system must have a sampling rate equal to the sum of each individual's Nyquist rate.

Wait, that can't be right. Because TDM combines the samples, so the total sampling rate is the sum of each individual's sampling rate. So for 2000 signals, each at 10 kHz, the total is 20 MHz.

But in that case, T_s would be 1/20e6 = 5e-8 s, which is 0.05 microseconds, 50 nanoseconds. But none of the options have that.

Wait, maybe the question is saying that the sampling is done at the Nyquist rate for the aggregate signal. Hmm, perhaps I should approach it from another angle.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total bandwidth required for the TDM system. The total bandwidth would be N times the individual bandwidth, but that's not quite right because bandwidth is per signal. Or wait, perhaps in TDM, the total bandwidth occupied by the multiplexed signal is roughly the sum of the individual signal bandwidths. But that's not quite correct either. The bandwidth in TDM is determined by the rate of the pulses, which depends on the sampling rate and the number of samples per frame.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the maximum pulse duration tau_max. In pulse code modulation (PCM) systems, the maximum pulse width (tau_max) is related to the sampling rate. The formula I remember is tau_max = 1/(2f_s), but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, let me think: the maximum pulse duration is the time between two consecutive samples, which would be the sampling interval. So tau_max can't exceed T_s. Or wait, perhaps it's the other way around; tau_max is the duration of each pulse, which in a non-return-to-zero (NRZ) system, can be as long as the bit period T_s. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, for a pulse to accurately represent a sample without causing intersymbol interference, the pulse duration must be less than or equal to the sampling interval. So tau_max <= T_s.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: the minimum time between samples is T_s. So any pulse representing a sample must not overlap with the next. So the maximum allowable duration of each pulse is T_s. Hence, tau_max = T_s.

But I'm not certain. Maybe I should look for a formula or relation. Oh, right, in the context of time-division multiplexing, each signal is sampled into a frame. Each frame consists of a sample from each signal, plus possibly some synchronization bits. The duration of each frame is T, and within that frame, each sample is held for a duration tau.

So the frame period T is equal to the sum of all the individual pulse durations plus any guard times. If there are N signals, each with a pulse duration tau, then T = N*tau. But wait, that's assuming no guard time, which is ideal.

So the frame rate is 1/T. Now, each individual signal is sampled at a rate f_s, which is the same as the frame rate because each frame contains one sample per signal. So f_s = 1/T.

But each signal's bandwidth is B, which is 5 kHz. So according to Nyquist, f_s >= 2B. So 1/T >= 2*5e3 => T <= 1/(1e4) = 1e-4 seconds.

But wait, T is the frame period, which is N*tau. Because in each frame, each of N signals contributes a pulse of duration tau. So T = N*tau.

So, substituting T = N*tau into T <= 1e-4 s,

N*tau <= 1e-4 s

tau <= (1e-4 s)/N

N is 2000, so tau <= (1e-4)/2000 = 5e-8 seconds. Which is 50 nanoseconds.

Wait, that would make tau_max = 5e-8 s. But looking at the options, none have that. Wait, looking back at the options, option J has T_s=8e-5 s and tau_max=4e-8, which is 40 ns, but that's not matching 5e-8.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming T = N*tau. Maybe each frame has N samples, and each sample is a pulse of duration tau. So T is the time for all N pulses, so T = N*tau. So the frame period is T.

But each signal is sampled at f_s = 1/T, which should be >= 2B.

So, 1/T >= 2B => T <= 1/(2B) = 1e-4 seconds.

But T = N*tau => N*tau <= 1e-4 => tau <= (1e-4)/N = (1e-4)/2000 = 5e-8 s.

So tau_max is 5e-8 s, which is 50 nanoseconds. But none of the options have that.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the relation between T_s and tau wrong. Let me clarify.

In the question, the sampling time T_s is the time between two consecutive samples in the TDM stream. So if each signal is sampled once per frame, and each frame has N samples, then the sampling time T_s would be the time between two samples in the TDM stream, which is T/N. Because each frame has N samples, each taking tau time, but the time between samples in the TDM is tau, assuming no guard period.

Wait, perhaps T_s is the time between two consecutive samples from any signal. So in the TDM system, the samples are taken at intervals of T_s, and each sample comes from a different signal. So the overall sampling rate is f_s = 1/T_s.

But each individual signal's sampling rate is f_s / N, because each signal is sampled once every N*T_s seconds.

So the individual sampling rate for each signal is f_s / N.

But according to Nyquist, f_s / N >= 2B.

So f_s >= 2B*N.

Given B=5e3 Hz, N=2000,

f_s >= 2*5e3*2000 = 2e7 Hz.

So f_s = 20e6 Hz.

Thus, T_s = 1/f_s = 5e-8 s = 50 ns.

But again, none of the options have T_s as 5e-8 and tau_max as 5e-8. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps I should calculate T_s as the Nyquist interval per signal, and then find tau_max.

Wait, another approach: The sampling time T_s is the reciprocal of the sampling rate. Since each signal is sampled at the Nyquist rate, which is 2B = 10 kHz. So T_s per signal is 1/(2B) = 1e-4 seconds.

But wait, that would mean each signal is sampled every 1e-4 seconds, so T_s is 1e-4 s.

But then, when TDM is applied with N=2000, each signal's sampling is interleaved. So the overall TDM sampling rate is N times the individual rate. So f_s_TDM = N * (2B) = 2000 * 1e4 = 2e7 Hz. So T_s_TDM = 1/f_s_TDM = 5e-8 s.

But in this case, the question is asking for the sampling time T_s, which I think refers to the overall TDM system's sampling interval, which would be 5e-8 s. But again, the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to T_s as the time between samples for each individual signal before TDM. So T_s would be 1/(2B) = 1e-4 s, as each signal is sampled at 1e4 Hz.

But when TDM is applied, the overall system's sampling rate is higher. But the question says "calculate the sampling time T_s", which is perhaps the individual sampling time for each signal before TDM. So T_s is 1e-4 s.

Then, for tau_max, the maximum pulse duration in the TDM system. Since the overall sampling rate is 2e7 Hz, the time between samples in the TDM is T_s_TDM = 5e-8 s. So each pulse can't exceed this time. So tau_max = T_s_TDM =5e-8 s.

But looking at the options, none have 1e-4 s for T_s and 5e-8 s for tau_max.

Wait, let's look at the options again.

Option E: T_s=1e-4, tau_max=0.5e-7 → 0.5e-7 is 5e-8, which is 50 ns. Wait, 0.5e-7 is 5e-8? No, 0.5e-7 is 5e-8? Wait, 0.5e-7 is 5 x10^-8? Yes, because 0.5e-7 = 5e-8.

So option E says T_s=1e-4 s, tau_max=0.5e-7 s.

Wait, then according to my previous calculation, T_s for each signal is 1e-4 s (1/(2*5e3)), and the tau_max would be 5e-8 s, which is 0.5e-7 s. So option E matches.

But earlier I thought the overall T_s is 5e-8 s, but maybe the question is asking for the individual T_s, which is 1e-4, and the tau_max in the TDM system is 5e-8, which is 0.5e-7 s.

Wait, but in the TDM system, each sample is spaced by T_s_TDM =5e-8 s, which is the time between two consecutive samples in the TDM stream. So the pulse duration tau must be less than or equal to T_s_TDM to prevent overlap. Hence, tau_max = 5e-8 s = 0.5e-7 s.

So looking at the options, option E has T_s=1e-4 s and tau_max=0.5e-7 s.

Yes, that seems correct. So the correct answer should be option E.

To solve the problem, we start by determining the sampling time \( T_s \) and the maximum pulse duration \( \tau_{\text{max}} \) for the given system. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Nyquist Sampling Rate**: Each signal has a bandwidth \( B = 5 \, \text{kHz} \). The Nyquist sampling rate for each signal is \( f_s = 2B = 10 \, \text{kHz} \). This means the sampling time for each signal is \( T_s = \frac{1}{f_s} = \frac{1}{10 \times 10^3} = 1 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{s
