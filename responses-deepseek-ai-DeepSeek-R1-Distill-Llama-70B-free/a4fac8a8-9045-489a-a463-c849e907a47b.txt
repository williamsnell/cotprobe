Question:

Which one of the following criticisms of the Dickey-Fuller/Engle-Granger approach to dealing with cointegrated variables is overcome by the Engle-Yoo (EY) procedure?

Options:

A: In the context of small samples, Dickey Fuller tests are prone to conclude that there is a unit root in a series when there is not
B: The Engle-Granger (EG) approach can only detect up to one cointegrating relationship even though there could be more than one
C: The variables are treated asymmetrically in the cointegrating tests
D: It is not possible to perform tests about the cointegrating relationship

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about econometrics, specifically about cointegration and the methods used. Hmm, the question is about the Dickey-Fuller/Engle-Granger approach and a criticism that's addressed by the Engle-Yoo procedure. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work this out.

First, I remember that cointegration deals with long-term relationships between non-stationary time series variables. The Engle-Granger two-step method is a common approach. They test for cointegration by estimating a regression equation between variables and then testing if the residuals are stationary using the Dickey-Fuller test.

Now, the question is about the Engle-Yoo procedure overcoming a specific criticism. I think Engle-Yoo is an alternative method, maybe a different approach to testing cointegration.

Looking at the options:

Option A: DF tests in small samples might falsely find a unit root when none exists. I think that's a known issue with Dickey-Fuller; they have low power against near-unit root alternatives in small samples. But does EY address this? I'm not sure. I thought EY might be about something else like the number of cointegrating relationships.

Option B: EG can only find one cointegrating relationship. Oh wait, yes! Engle-Granger's approach can only detect up to one cointegrating equation because it's a two-variable or reduced rank regression framework. If there are multiple variables, you might miss other relationships. But the Engle-Yoo method, maybe it's part of the Johansen approach which can handle multiple cointegrating vectors. Or wait, maybe EY is a different approach. Wait, I'm getting confused. Wait, I think Engle-Yoo is another name or maybe a variant. Alternatively, the EG method is limited to testing a single cointegrating relationship, so if the true model has multiple, EG can't detect all. So Engle-Yoo might allow for multiple cointegrating relationships. So this could be a possible answer.

Option C: Variables are treated asymmetrically in cointegrating tests. I'm not exactly sure what that means. In EG, you choose one variable as the dependent variable and others as independent. Does this asymmetry cause issues? Maybe, but I'm not sure if EY addresses that. Or perhaps other methods like the Johansen method treat variables symmetrically. I think the EG approach does treat variables asymmetrically because you have to choose which variable to put on the left-hand side. But I'm not sure if EY specifically addresses this.

Option D: Can't perform tests about the cointegrating relationship. Wait, I thought EG does allow testing through the Dickey-Fuller on the residuals. So this might not be the issue EY is solving.

Wait, going back to the options. The question is about which criticism the Engle-Yoo procedure overcomes. So which of these is a problem with EG that EY fixes.

I think the main issue with Engle-Granger is that it's limited to testing for a single cointegrating relationship. So if you have a system with multiple variables, you might miss other relationships. Engle-Yoo, I believe, is part of the maximum likelihood approach, perhaps in the context of the Johansen method, which can handle multiple cointegrating vectors. So Option B would be correct because EY can detect multiple cointegrating relationships, overcoming the EG limitation.

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up EY with the Johansen approach. Wait, the question says Engle-Yoo procedure. I'm trying to recall: I think the Engle-Yoo approach is a method for testing cointegration in a system with more than two variables and allows for multiple cointegrating relationships. So that would support option B.

So putting it all together, the answer should be B.

The question asks which criticism of the Dickey-Fuller/Engle-Granger (EG) approach is addressed by the Engle-Yoo (EY) procedure. The EG approach is a two-step method for testing cointegration, where a regression is estimated, and the residuals are tested for stationarity using the Dickey-Fuller test. However, it has limitations, particularly in systems with multiple variables.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Dickey-Fuller tests can have low power in small samples, potentially leading to incorrect conclusions about unit roots. However, this is not directly related to the EY procedure, which focuses on cointegration testing rather than unit root testing.

- **Option B**: The EG approach is limited to detecting only one cointegrating relationship, even when multiple relationships may exist. This is a significant criticism, as systems with multiple variables often involve more than one cointegrating vector. The EY procedure overcomes this limitation by allowing for the detection of multiple cointegrating relationships, making this the correct answer.

- **Option C**: The EG approach treats variables asymmetrically, as it requires designating one variable as the dependent variable. While this is a valid criticism, it is not the primary issue addressed by the EY procedure.

- **Option D**: The EG approach does allow testing of the cointegrating relationship through residual diagnostics, so this is not a relevant criticism.

The EY procedure addresses the limitation of the EG approach by enabling the detection of multiple cointegrating relationships, which is a key improvement in systems with multiple variables.
