Question:

A partnership conveyed a general warranty deed representing a vacant parcel of land to the purchaser. In the deed, the grantee and her assigns were required by covenant to share proportionately in the paving of a road that abutted the property. The grantee conveyed the property to a married couple by special warranty deed that did not contain any of the conditions of the covenant regarding paving the new road. The buyers did not have an attorney and did not do a title search. When the road was completed, the married couple buyers refused to pay the share that was demanded of them. The original sellers of the parcel sued the couple in an equity claim without a jury. The judge ruled that the couple had to pay their share of the paving. On appeal, will the appellate court affirm the trial judge's order?

Options:

A: No, because the couple were not aware of the covenant due to not having a lawyer and not conducting a title search.
B: No, because the general warranty of the original sellers did not apply beyond the first purchaser.
C: Yes, because a landowner is in any event responsible for her share of improvements to any abutting private roads.
D: Yes, this is a covenant running with the land because it was intended to apply to the first purchaser's heirs and "assigns".
E: Yes, because the covenant was part of the original agreement and therefore applies to all subsequent owners.
F: Yes, because the couple should have conducted a title search to understand the obligations associated with the property.
G: No, because the sellers did not explicitly communicate the covenant to the couple.
H: Yes, because the couple should have hired an attorney to understand the obligations of the property.
I: No, because the special warranty deed given to the couple did not include any obligations related to the paving of the road.
J: No, because the paving requirement had to be placed in the deed to the married couple and it was not.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this real estate law question. Let me read through it again carefully.

So, the situation is about a partnership that sold a vacant parcel of land using a general warranty deed. In this deed, there's a covenant where the grantee (the first buyer) and their assigns are required to share proportionately in paving a road that abuts the property. Then, this grantee sells the property to a married couple using a special warranty deed. This second deed doesn't mention the paving covenant. The couple didn't hire an attorney or do a title search. When the road was done, they refused to pay their share. The original sellers sued and the judge ruled against them, making them pay. Now, they're appealing, and we need to determine if the appellate court will affirm that decision.

Hmm. So the key here is whether the covenant runs with the land, meaning it's binding on subsequent owners.

I remember that for a covenant to run with the land, certain criteria must be met. There's the concept of horizontal privity and vertical privity. Horizontal privity usually refers to the original parties being in some sort of legal relationship, like landlord and tenant or parties to a mutual easement. Vertical privity means that the covenant must have been intended to pass to the assignees or successors.

Wait, another point: the covenant needs to "touch and concern" the land. Paving a road that abuts the property seems to touch and concern because it's about the land's use and benefits the land.

Also, the original covenant was in a general warranty deed, which typically includes covenants that run with the land, like seisin, against encumbrances, right to convey, warranty, etc. But wait, the paving covenant isn't one of those standard covenants; it's an additional one. So whether it's intended to run would depend on the language. The deed says the grantee and her assigns must share proportionately. So that language suggests it's intended to bind future owners.

When the first grantee (the partnership's buyer) sold to the couple via a special warranty deed, that deed didn't include the paving covenant. But does that matter? Because if the covenant runs with the land, the subsequent buyer is still bound, regardless of whether it's in their deed. The subsequent deed doesn't affect the validity of a covenant that already runs with the land.

So the couple didn't do a title search and didn't have an attorney. But in real estate law, the doctrine of constructive notice applies. Once a covenant is properly recorded, subsequent purchasers are deemed to have notice, even if they didn't actually know about it. So their lack of knowledge or not doing a title search wouldn't necessarily save them.

Looking at the options:

Option D says yes because it's a covenant running with the land intended for heirs and assigns. That seems right because the original deed mentioned assigns, so vertical privity exists. The paving touches and concerns the land, and it was intended to run.

Option I says no because the special warranty didn't include it. But that's not correct because the covenant is from the original deed, and the special warranty deed doesn't affect the prior covenant.

Option J says no because it wasn't in their deed. But that's wrong for the same reason as I.

Option A says no because they didn't know. But as I thought, constructive notice from the recording makes that irrelevant.

Option B says no because the general warranty doesn't go beyond the first purchaser. But the warranty isn't the same as the covenant. The covenant is a separate issue.

So the correct answer should be D: Yes, because it's a covenant running with the land as it was intended for assigns.

The appellate court will affirm the trial judge's order because the covenant requiring the grantee and her assigns to share proportionately in paving the road is a covenant running with the land. For a covenant to run with the land, it must meet certain criteria: it must touch and concern the land, there must be intent for it to bind successors, and there must be privity of estate (both horizontal and vertical). Here, the covenant touches and concerns the land because it relates to improvements (paving) that benefit the property. The language in the original deed explicitly states that the covenant applies to the grantee and her assigns, demonstrating the intent to bind future owners. Vertical privity exists because the covenant was intended to pass to successors. The fact that the subsequent deed (special warranty) did not include the covenant does not negate its enforceability, as covenants running with the land are binding regardless of whether they are restated in later deeds. Additionally, the doctrine of constructive notice applies, meaning the buyers are deemed to have knowledge of the covenant if it was properly recorded, even if they did not conduct a title search or hire an attorney.

The best answer is D.
