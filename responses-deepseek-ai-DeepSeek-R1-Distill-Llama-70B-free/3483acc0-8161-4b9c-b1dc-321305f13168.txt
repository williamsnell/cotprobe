Okay, so I've got this question about group theory, specifically dealing with homomorphic images of cyclic and Abelian groups. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my algebra, but let me try to work through this step by step.

Alright, the question presents two statements and asks which pair is correct. The statements are:

1. The homomorphic image of a cyclic group is cyclic.
2. The homomorphic image of an Abelian group is Abelian.

The options are A to D, each pairing true or false for the two statements.

Let me tackle each statement one by one.

Starting with Statement 1: The homomorphic image of a cyclic group is cyclic.

So, I remember that a cyclic group is one that can be generated by a single element. Like, all elements are powers (or multiples, depending on whether it's additive or multiplicative) of a generator element. Now, a homomorphism is a structure-preserving map between two algebraic structures. The image of a homomorphism is the set of all output elements produced by the homomorphism.

Wait, what's the homomorphic image? Oh right, the image of the homomorphism is a subgroup of the codomain group. So if I have a homomorphism φ: G → H, then the image φ(G) is a subgroup of H.

Now, if G is cyclic, then every element in G is of the form g^n for some generator g. What happens when we apply φ to G? Let's say φ(g) = h in H. Then every element in φ(G) would be of the form h^n, because φ(g^n) = φ(g)^n = h^n. So the image is generated by h, which means the image is cyclic.

Wait, that makes sense. So the image of a cyclic group under a homomorphism is cyclic. So Statement 1 must be true.

Now, Statement 2: The homomorphic image of an Abelian group is Abelian.

An Abelian group is one where the group operation is commutative; that is, for all a, b in G, ab = ba. If I have a homomorphism φ: G → H, with G Abelian, what about the image φ(G)?

Well, let's think about the properties preserved under homomorphisms. Since φ is a homomorphism, it preserves the group operation. So for any two elements a and b in G, φ(ab) = φ(a)φ(b). But since G is Abelian, ab = ba, so φ(ab) = φ(ba) = φ(b)φ(a). Wait, but that's the same as φ(a)φ(b), so φ(a)φ(b) = φ(b)φ(a). That means in the image, every pair of elements commutes. So φ(G) is Abelian.

So Statement 2 should also be true.

Wait, but let me double-check. Suppose I have a larger Abelian group G, and φ maps G onto some group H. If G is Abelian, any subgroup of H (which is the image) must also be Abelian because the operation is inherited from H, and since every element's image comes from G's commuting elements, their images must commute as well.

Yes, that makes sense. So both statements are true.

Looking back at the options:

A: True, False → Not correct because both are true.
B: False, True → No, because statement 1 is true.
C: False, False → No, both are true.
D: True, True → Yes, this is correct.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think if there's any edge case or something I'm missing. For Statement 1, suppose the homomorphism isn't surjective. But the image is still a subgroup, and as I reasoned, it's cyclic because it's generated by the image of the generator. So even if it's a proper subgroup, it's cyclic. So yeah, Statement 1 holds.

And for Statement 2, since the image inherits the commutativity from G, because the homomorphism preserves the operation, the image must be Abelian. So both statements are true.

Statement 1: The homomorphic image of a cyclic group is cyclic.

A cyclic group is one that can be generated by a single element, meaning all elements are powers (or multiples) of a generator. A homomorphism preserves the group operation, and the image of a cyclic group under a homomorphism is generated by the image of the generator. Therefore, the image is cyclic. This statement is **true**.

Statement 2: The homomorphic image of an Abelian group is Abelian.

An Abelian group is commutative, meaning for all elements \(a\) and \(b\), \(ab = ba\). A homomorphism preserves the group operation, so if \(G\) is Abelian, the image of \(G\) under a homomorphism will also be commutative. Thus, the image is Abelian. This statement is also **true**.

Given that both statements are true, the correct answer is:

**D: True, True**

Answer: D
