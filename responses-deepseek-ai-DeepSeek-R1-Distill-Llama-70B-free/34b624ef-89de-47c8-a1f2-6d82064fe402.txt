Okay, so I've got this gas volume problem to solve. Let me think through it step by step. The question says that a certain gas occupies 100 ml at 20°C, and we need to find the volume at 10°C when the pressure is constant. Hmm, right, this sounds like a Charles's Law problem.

Wait, Charles's Law is about the relationship between volume and temperature when pressure is constant. The formula is V1/T1 = V2/T2, right? Oh yes, but wait, temperature has to be in Kelvin, not Celsius. Oh right, I always forget that part.

So first, I need to convert the temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin. For 20°C, adding 273.15 gives 293.15 K. And 10°C would be 283.15 K. Oh wait, yeah, because 0°C is 273.15 K.

So the initial volume V1 is 100 ml, initial temperature T1 is 293.15 K. The final temperature T2 is 283.15 K, and we're solving for V2.

Plugging into the formula: 100 ml / 293.15 K = V2 / 283.15 K. So I can rearrange this to find V2. Multiply both sides by 283.15 K to get V2 = (100 ml * 283.15) / 293.15.

Let me calculate that. Let's approximate the values a bit for easier math. 283.15 is about 283, and 293.15 is about 293. So 100 * 283 / 293. Let me compute 283/293 first. Hmm, 283 divided by 293 is approximately 0.966. So 100 ml * 0.966 would be roughly 96.6 ml.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see option I is 96.6 ml. That must be the correct answer. But wait, wait—did I do the calculation right? Let me double-check the division. 283/293 equals approximately 0.966. Multiply by 100 gives 96.6. Yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should be more precise with the calculation. Let's compute 283.15 divided by 293.15 exactly. Let me grab a calculator (pretending, of course). 283.15 ÷ 293.15 ≈ 0.9663. So 100 * 0.9663 is 96.63, which rounds to 96.6 ml.

So the volume decreases when the temperature decreases, which makes sense because gases expand when heated and contract when cooled. So from 20°C to 10°C, the volume should get smaller than 100 ml. So the answer should be less than 100. Looking at the options, I is 96.6, which fits.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. So the correct answer should be option I.

To solve the problem, we apply Charles's Law, which states that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to its temperature when pressure is constant. The formula is:

\[
\frac{V_1}{T_1} = \frac{V_2}{T_2}
\]

Here:
- \( V_1 = 100 \, \text{ml} \) (initial volume),
- \( T_1 = 20^\circ \text{C} = 293.15 \, \text{K} \) (initial temperature in Kelvin),
- \( T_2 = 10^\circ \text{C} = 283.15 \, \text{K} \) (final temperature in Kelvin),
- \( V_2 \) is the unknown final volume.

Rearranging the formula to solve for \( V_2 \):

\[
V_2 = V_1 \cdot \frac{T_2}{T_1}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
V_2 = 100 \cdot \frac{283.15}{293.15}
\]

Approximating the division:

\[
\frac{283.15}{293.15} \approx 0.966
\]

Thus:

\[
V_2 \approx 100 \cdot 0.966 = 96.6 \, \text{ml}
\]

The calculated volume is consistent with option I. Since the temperature decreases, the volume also decreases, which aligns with the behavior of gases.
