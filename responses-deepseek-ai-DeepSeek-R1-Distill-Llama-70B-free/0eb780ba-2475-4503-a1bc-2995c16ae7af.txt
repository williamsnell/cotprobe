Okay, so I've got this question about employment law, specifically about vicarious liability. Hmm, let me try to work through this. 

So the situation is that an employee works as a delivery person for a drugstore. His job is delivering prescriptions and other items like toiletries, cosmetics, etc. One day, he remembers it's his girlfriend's birthday. He buys her perfume from the store, pays full price, gets it wrapped, and then uses the company van to deliver it to her house during his working hours. He was on his way to make another delivery when he decided to go to her house. While driving there, he runs a red light and hits another driver who had the green light. The driver gets injured, and now they're suing the drugstore.

The question is whether the driver will prevail in the lawsuit against the drugstore. The options are from A to J.

I remember that vicarious liability is when an employer can be held liable for the actions of an employee, but only if those actions were within the scope of employment. So the key here is determining whether the employee was acting within the scope of his job when the accident happened.

Let's break it down. The employee was on duty, using the company van, and was supposed to be making deliveries. But he took a detour to deliver a personal gift. Even though he was in the van and during work hours, the purpose of driving to his girlfriend's house was personal, not related to his job duties. 

In such cases, courts often look at whether the employee's actions were within the scope of their employment. If the activity was entirely personal and not related to the job, the employer might not be liable. For example, if the employee was running a personal errand not related to work, the employer isn't responsible unless the errand was in some way benefiting the employer or was something the employer allowed.

So here, delivering the perfume was a personal errand. He paid for it himself, wrapped it, and delivered it during work hours but while on his way to another delivery. Even though he was using the company van, the primary purpose of that trip was personal. Unless the employer allowed or expected him to use the van for personal errands, which isn't indicated here, the employer wouldn't be liable.

Looking at the options:

Option I says the driver won't prevail because the employee was acting outside the scope of employment. That fits because the personal errand wasn't part of his job duties.

Option A says the driver will prevail because he was using the company van. But mere use of the van isn't enough; the use has to be within the scope of employment.

Option C says the driver will prevail because they had the right of way. While that's true, the employer's liability depends on the employee's actions being within the scope, not just on who was at fault in the accident.

Option D says the employee was under the control of the drugstore. But if he was doing a personal errand, the employer's control over his actions during that errand is limited.

Option H says because he was on duty. Being on duty doesn't automatically mean every action is within scope; it's about the nature of the activity.

So the correct answer seems to be option I.

The question revolves around whether the drugstore can be held vicariously liable for the employee's actions during the accident. Vicarious liability applies when an employee's actions are within the scope of their employment. Here, the employee was on duty, using the company van, and during work hours, but he was on a personal errandâ€”delivering a birthday gift to his girlfriend. This personal activity was not related to his job duties, even though it occurred during work hours and involved the company van. Courts typically find that employers are not liable for accidents occurring during personal errands unless the errand benefits the employer or is explicitly allowed.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option I** correctly identifies that the employee was acting outside the scope of employment, making the drugstore not liable.
- Other options either focus on irrelevant details (e.g., use of the van, being on duty) or misapply legal principles.

Thus, the driver will not prevail because the employee was outside the scope of employment.
