Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the coefficient of Φ0 in a CI-SD wave function. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the question gives me some energies from different calculations. There's the frozen-core SCF/DZP energy, which is -76.040542 hartrees. Then there's the CI-SD/DZP energy, which is -76.243772 hartrees. Oh wait, and after applying the Davidson correction, the energy becomes -76.254549 hartrees. 

Wait, what do I remember about CI-SD and Davidson corrections? CI-SD is Configuration Interaction with Single and Double excitations. So the wave function is a linear combination of the reference determinant (Φ0) and all the singly and doubly excited determinants. The coefficient of Φ0 is what we're looking for.

I think the Davidson correction is used to estimate the energy of a more extensive CI calculation (like full CI) from a limited one, like CISD. The formula involves the square of the sum of the coefficients of the excited configurations. Or wait, maybe the sum of the squares? I'm a bit mixed up here.

Wait, the Davidson correction formula. I recall it's something like E_Davidson = E_CISD + (1 - c0²)(E_CISD - E_SCF). Because the correction accounts for the missing higher-order excitations, which are approximated by scaling the difference between CISD and SCF energies by (1 - c0²). 

Right, because c0 is the coefficient of the reference determinant. So if c0 is 1, then (1-c0²) is zero, meaning no correction. But if c0 is less than one, we add a fraction of the difference between CISD and SCF.

So the Davidson-corrected energy is E = E_CISD + (1 - c0²)(E_CISD - E_SCF). 

Wait, let me double-check that formula. Oh right, because the Davidson correction estimates the effect of higher excitations beyond singles and doubles. The correction is applied as ΔE = (1 - c0²)(E_CISD - E_SCF). So the total corrected energy is E_CISD + ΔE.

So in our case, the corrected energy is -76.254549 hartrees. The E_CISD is -76.243772, and the SCF is -76.040542. So plugging into the formula:

E_corrected = E_CISD + (1 - c0²)(E_CISD - E_SCF)

So let's compute the difference (E_CISD - E_SCF). That's (-76.243772) - (-76.040542) = (-76.243772 + 76.040542) = -0.20323 hartrees. Wait, no, that's the difference. Actually, I think it's E_CISD is lower in energy (more negative) than E_SCF, so the difference E_CISD - E_SCF is negative, but wait, in magnitude, it's how much the CISD improved upon SCF.

But regardless, let's plug the numbers in. Let me compute E_corrected - E_CISD first, which equals the Davidson correction term.

E_corrected - E_CISD = (-76.254549) - (-76.243772) = (-76.254549 +76.243772) = -0.010777 hartrees.

So:

-0.010777 = (1 - c0²)(E_CISD - E_SCF)

We have E_CISD - E_SCF = (-76.243772) - (-76.040542) = (-76.243772 +76.040542) = -0.20323.

So:

-0.010777 = (1 - c0²) * (-0.20323)

Divide both sides by (-0.20323):

( -0.010777 ) / ( -0.20323 ) = (1 - c0²)

So that's 0.010777 / 0.20323 ≈ 0.053.

So 0.053 ≈ 1 - c0².

So solving for c0² = 1 - 0.053 = 0.947.

Then c0 is the square root of 0.947. Let's calculate that. The square root of 0.947 is approximately 0.973. Because 0.97² is 0.9409, 0.973^2 is let's see: 973 *973. Let me compute 970^2 = 940900, 3^2=9, and 2*970*3=5820. So 940900 + 5820 +9 = 946729. So (0.973)^2 is 0.946729, which is about 0.9467, which is close to 0.947. So c0 is approximately 0.973.

Looking at the options, option H is 0.9731, which matches our calculation.

To determine the coefficient \( c_0 \) of \(\Phi_0\) in the normalized CI-SD wave function, we use the Davidson correction formula:

\[
E_{\text{Davidson}} = E_{\text{CI-SD}} + (1 - c_0^2)(E_{\text{CI-SD}} - E_{\text{SCF}})
\]

Here, the given energies are:
- \( E_{\text{SCF}} = -76.040542 \, \text{hartrees} \),
- \( E_{\text{CI-SD}} = -76.243772 \, \text{hartrees} \),
- \( E_{\text{Davidson}} = -76.254549 \, \text{hartrees} \).

First, calculate the difference \( E_{\text{CI-SD}} - E_{\text{SCF}} \):
\[
E_{\text{CI-SD}} - E_{\text{SCF}} = -76.243772 - (-76.040542) = -0.20323 \, \text{hartrees}.
\]

Next, calculate the difference \( E_{\text{Davidson}} - E_{\text{CI-SD}} \):
\[
E_{\text{Davidson}} - E_{\text{CI-SD}} = -76.254549 - (-76.243772) = -0.010777 \, \text{hartrees}.
\]

Substitute these values into the Davidson correction formula:
\[
-0.010777 = (1 - c_0^2)(-0.20323).
\]

Divide through by \(-0.20323\):
\[
\frac{-0.010777}{-0.20323} = 1 - c_0^2.
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
0.053 = 1 - c_0^2.
\]

Rearranging gives:
\[
c_0^2 = 1 - 0.053 = 0.947.
\]

Taking the square root:
\[
c_0 = \sqrt{0.947} \approx 0.973.
\]

Thus, the coefficient \( c_0 \) is approximately \( 0.973 \). Comparing this result to the options provided, the closest match is:

**H: 0.9731.**
