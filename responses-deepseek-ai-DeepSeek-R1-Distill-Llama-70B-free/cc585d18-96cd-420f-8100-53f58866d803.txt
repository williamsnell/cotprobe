Okay, so I've got this tort question to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The scenario is about a husband and wife shopping at a department store. The wife is over 300 pounds and can't find a dress in her size. She asks a clerk if they have it, and the clerk responds by calling her a hippopotamus and saying they don't have the "hippo size." Another customer overhears this and starts laughing. The wife gets upset and leaves. Now, she's suing the department store based on the clerk's actions.

The question is asking what the outcome would be if she asserts a tort action against the store. The options are from A to J.

I remember that torts can include things like negligence, battery, assault, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Since the clerk made a comment that was clearly demeaning, I think this might relate to intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED). 

To win an IIED claim, the plaintiff has to show that the defendant's conduct was extreme and outrageous, that it was intentional or reckless, that it caused emotional distress, and that the distress was severe.

Looking at the clerk's actions, calling someone a hippopotamus in a public place, especially when they're already vulnerable because of their size, seems pretty extreme. It's not just a casual insult; it's done in a way that others could hear, which likely caused embarrassment and distress. The fact that another customer laughed supports that it was humiliating.

So, for the elements: the conduct was extreme (calling her a hippo in front of others), it was intentional (the clerk chose to say that), it caused emotional distress (she became very upset and left), and the distress was severe enough to matter legally.

Now, looking at the options:

Option B says she'll win because the clerk's conduct was extreme and outrageous. That aligns with the IIED elements.

Option C says she'll win because the actions caused her emotional distress. Well, that's part of it, but the conduct also needs to be extreme and outrageous.

Option F says she'll win because the comment was intended to ridicule. That's also correct, but IIED requires more than just intent; it needs the extreme outrageousness.

Option E suggests she loses because the clerk was stating an opinion. But I think when the statement is so offensive and made in a harmful way, it's not just a protected opinion. Plus, some opinions can be defamatory or part of an IIED claim.

Option D says she loses because no physical harm. But IIED doesn't require physical harm; severe emotional distress is enough.

Option I says she loses because she only had hurt feelings. Again, if it's severe enough, that's sufficient for IIED, so this might not be the case.

Option H says she loses because there was no intent to harm. But the clerk's comment seems intentional, meant to mock, so this doesn't apply.

Options A, G, J don't seem directly relevant. A is about not carrying her size, which isn't the issue here. G is about someone overhearing, which is a fact but not the determining factor. J says public place, but that doesn't really affect tort liability here.

So, putting it all together, the key is whether the clerk's actions meet the standard for IIED. The conduct was extreme and outrageous, intended to cause distress, and did cause it. Therefore, the wife should win based on B.

The correct answer is B. The wife will win because the clerk's conduct was extreme and outrageous, which is a key element of intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED). The clerk's comment, made in a public setting, was intentionally demeaning and caused the wife significant emotional distress. 

Answer: B
