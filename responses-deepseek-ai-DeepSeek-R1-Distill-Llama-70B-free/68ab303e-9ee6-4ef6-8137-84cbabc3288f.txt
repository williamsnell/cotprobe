Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these concepts yet. But I'll try to tackle it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem is about a piston-cylinder device containing steam. The initial state is 160 psia and 500°F, with a volume of 0.1 ft³. Then it expands to 20 psia, and during this process, 0.50 Btu of heat is transferred to the system. We need to find two things: (a) the actual useful work done by the system, and (b) the change in availability during the process. The options are from A to J.

Hmm, okay. So part (a) is about work done, and part (b) about change in availability. I remember that availability has to do with the exergy or the potential work a system can do relative to the surroundings.

First, let's think about part (a). The actual useful work done. I think for a piston-cylinder device undergoing a process, the work done is the integral of PdV. But without knowing the process path (like is it isothermal, adiabatic, etc.), I can't directly compute it. Oh wait, but maybe I can use the first law of thermodynamics, which is Q = ΔU + W, where Q is heat added, ΔU is change in internal energy, and W is work done by the system.

Wait, but the problem says that heat is transferred to the system, so Q is positive. Q is 0.50 Btu here. So the equation would be Q = ΔU + W, which rearranges to W = Q - ΔU. So I need to find ΔU to find W.

But to find ΔU, I need the initial and final states. So I need to find the initial and final internal energies of the steam.

The initial state is 160 psia and 500°F. I think steam tables would be necessary here. Since I don't have the exact steam tables in front of me, I need to recall or approximate the values. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects looking up specific properties.

Wait, I remember that at 160 psia (which is about 160 psi above atmospheric, so absolute pressure is 160 + 14.7 = 174.7 psia), and 500°F, the steam is superheated. Let me think about typical steam table values. At 160 psia, the saturation temperature is lower than 500°F, so definitely superheated.

Similarly, expanding to 20 psia. 20 psia is 20 psi above atmospheric, so 20 + 14.7 = 34.7 psia. And as for the temperature, when it expands, it might be in the superheated region or maybe wet steam. But without knowing the exact final state temperature, it's hard to say. Wait, maybe I can assume that the expansion is such that it's a constant pressure process, but I don't think that's given. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reversible adiabatic process, but no, because heat is being transferred.

Wait, the process is expansion, so the pressure drops from 160 psia to 20 psia. Since the system is doing work, but heat is being added, it's probably not adiabatic. So I can't use the adiabatic equations.

Back to the first law: W = Q - ΔU. So I need the internal energy at the initial and final states.

Let me try to recall some approximate values. At 160 psia (about 11.03 bar), 500°F (which is way above saturation, so superheated). The internal energy (u) for superheated steam at 160 psia and 500°F... I think it's around 1100 Btu/lbm? Or maybe higher. Wait, wait, at lower pressures, the u is lower. For example, at 14.7 psia (1 atm), steam at 500°F would have u around 1100 Btu/lbm. At higher pressures, the u increases a bit. So maybe around 1150 or 1200 Btu/lbm.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of specific volume. The volume is 0.1 ft³, but I need mass. Oh wait, because the volume is given, perhaps we can find the mass using the ideal gas equation. But wait, steam doesn't behave ideally, especially at high pressures, but maybe in this case, it's an approximation.

Wait, the ideal gas law is PV = mRT. So if I can find the specific volume, I can find mass, but maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using the steam tables with the given data.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the mass using the initial conditions. So initial pressure P1 = 160 psia, temperature T1 = 500°F. Let me convert T1 to absolute: 500 + 459.67 = 959.67 °R.

The specific volume v1 can be found from steam tables for superheated steam at 160 psia and 500°F. Let me try to remember or approximate. At 160 psia, the saturation temperature is about 388°F. So 500°F is superheated. At 160 psia, superheated steam at 500°F: v1 is around 0.0177 ft³/lbm (but I'm not sure). Wait, I think at 160 psia and 500°F, v is about 0.0177 ft³/lbm. So then, the mass m = V1 / v1 = 0.1 ft³ / 0.0177 ft³/lbm ≈ 5.65 lbm.

Wait, that's a rough calculation, but perhaps it's acceptable as an approximation.

Then, for the final state, P2 = 20 psia. But what's the specific volume v2? Well, after expansion, the volume increases. Since the process is expansion, the specific volume increases. But without knowing the final temperature, it's hard. Alternatively, perhaps the process is such that the final state is at 20 psia and some temperature. But without knowing if it's saturated or superheated, it's tricky.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Maybe I should use the first law in terms of enthalpy and entropy, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the work done as the boundary work, which is P_ext * ΔV. But if the expansion is against atmospheric pressure, then the useful work would be the work done against the atmosphere. Wait, that's probably it. Because when a piston expands, the work done is against the external pressure, which is atmospheric in this case.

Wait, but the system goes from 160 psia to 20 psia. So perhaps the expansion is a two-step process: first, the steam expands from 160 psia to 20 psia, and then any additional expansion to atmospheric pressure? Or maybe the 20 psia is the final pressure, which is above atmospheric. Hmm.

Wait, the question says atmospheric conditions are 14.7 psia and 80°F. So the final pressure is 20 psia. So the system's pressure is 20 psia, and the surroundings are at 14.7 psia. So the actual useful work done would be the work done against the atmospheric pressure, which is the integral from the initial volume to the final volume of P_ext dV, where P_ext is atmospheric pressure.

Wait, but in reality, the expansion is from initial volume V1 to final volume V2, and the external pressure is Patm. So the work done would be W = Patm (V2 - V1). But wait, that's only if the process is against a constant external pressure, and the system's pressure is higher than that. So in this case, during expansion, the system's pressure drops from 160 psia to 20 psia, but external pressure is 14.7 psia. So the useful work would be the area under the external pressure line from V1 to V_final, where V_final is when the system's pressure is 20 psia. But wait, in reality, the system's pressure can't be lower than the external pressure unless it's in a vacuum, which isn't the case here.

Wait, perhaps the process is such that the system expands until its internal pressure equals the external pressure. But the given final pressure is 20 psia, which is higher than atmospheric (14.7 psia). So maybe the expansion stops at 20 psia, which is higher than atmospheric. So the actual useful work would be the work done by the system against atmospheric pressure, which would be Patm*(V2 - V1), where V2 is the volume at 20 psia.

But wait, the process is expansion from 160 psia to 20 psia, so the volume increases. The initial volume is 0.1 ft³. So we need to find the final volume at 20 psia and the final temperature. But without knowing the final temperature, it's hard to find the final volume. Alternatively, perhaps the process is isothermal or something else, but that's not given.

Wait, but the heat transfer is given as 0.50 Btu into the system. So maybe the process is a constant pressure process? Or perhaps it's a polytropic process. Without knowing, I'm a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is such that the heat added allows us to calculate the work done. Let me think again about the first law: Q = ΔU + W.

So I need to find ΔU, which is U2 - U1. U is internal energy, which depends on the state.

Assuming that I can find U1 and U2 from the steam tables.

So let's proceed step by step.

First, find U1 at 160 psia and 500°F.

Looking up superheated steam tables at 160 psia (absolute pressure 174.7 psia):

At 160 psia and 500°F, from steam tables, u1 ≈ 1106.3 Btu/lbm.

Wait, I'm recalling that at 160 psia and 500°F, the internal energy is around 1106 Btu/lbm. Then, the mass m is V1 / v1. v1 is the specific volume at that state. At 160 psia and 500°F, v1 is about 0.01773 ft³/lbm. So m = 0.1 / 0.01773 ≈ 5.64 lbm.

So U1 = m * u1 ≈ 5.64 * 1106.3 ≈ let's see, 5 * 1106 is 5530, 0.64*1106≈707. So total U1 ≈ 6237 Btu.

Wait, but that seems high. Wait, no, because 5.64 lbm times 1100 is about 6200 Btu. So that's correct.

Now, for state 2: P2 = 20 psia. But what is the temperature? Because the heat added is 0.50 Btu, and the work done is to be found.

Wait, but perhaps the process can be modeled as a constant pressure expansion? No, because the pressure drops from 160 to 20 psia.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a constant volume process, but no, because volume increases.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is such that the steam does work against a piston moving out, and heat is added. But without knowing the process path, it's challenging.

Wait, perhaps the key is to consider the actual work done as the work done against the atmosphere. So the useful work W_useful = P_atm (V2 - V1).

So I need to find V2, the final volume.

But to find V2, I need to know the state at 20 psia. So what's the temperature at state 2? Hmm. Since heat is added, Q = 0.50 Btu, and the system is expanding, perhaps it's an isothermal expansion? No, because for isothermal, ΔU would be zero for ideal gas, but steam is not ideal. Alternatively, maybe it's a polytropic process.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is such that the final state is 20 psia and the same specific volume as before? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the ideal gas equation to estimate V2. Wait, but steam is not an ideal gas, but maybe for the sake of this problem, we can approximate.

At state 2: P2 = 20 psia = 20 + 14.7 = 34.7 psia (abs), T2 = ?

Wait, but without knowing T2, I can't find V2 using ideal gas. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to find the work using the first law and the given heat.

Wait, let's think again. The first law is Q = ΔU + W, where W is the work done by the system. But in this case, the work done by the system would be the boundary work, which is the integral of P dV. But without knowing P as a function of V, it's hard. Unless it's a constant pressure process, which I don't think it is.

Alternatively, perhaps the work done is the maximum possible, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering that the system expands against atmospheric pressure, so the work done is P_atm (V2 - V1). So to find V2, we need the specific volume at 20 psia and some temperature T2. But without knowing T2, it's difficult. However, perhaps the process can be approximated as an isothermal expansion at T1, but that's unlikely because heat is added.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is adiabatic, but no, because Q is 0.50 Btu in.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the heat added is Q = 0.50 Btu, and the work done is found via W = Q - ΔU.

So I need to find ΔU = U2 - U1.

U1 is known as approximately 6237 Btu (from earlier calculation).

But I don't know U2. To find U2, I need to know the state at P2 = 20 psia. So I need to find the specific volume v2 and the internal energy u2.

But how? Without knowing the process, it's hard. Unless the process is such that the final state is 20 psia and the same entropy as initial (isentropic expansion), but that's not stated.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is such that the final state is 20 psia and the same specific volume as initial. But that would require knowing the initial specific volume and ensuring that it's possible at 20 psia.

Wait, the initial specific volume v1 is 0.01773 ft³/lbm. At 20 psia, what's the specific volume for saturated vapor? Because if the final state is at 20 psia and the same specific volume as initial, it might be superheated or saturated.

At 20 psia (34.7 psia abs), the saturation temperature is about 230.1°F. The specific volume of saturated vapor at 20 psia is about 26.80 ft³/lbm. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, in steam tables, the specific volume of saturated vapor at 20 psia (which is 20 psi above atmospheric, so 34.7 psia) is around 26.8 ft³/lbm? That seems high. Wait, no, perhaps it's 26.8 cubic feet per pound mass. Wait, but that seems too high for such a low pressure. Wait, maybe I'm confusing units. Let me think again.

Wait, at atmospheric pressure (14.7 psia), the specific volume of saturated steam is about 26.8 ft³/lbm. So at 20 psia (34.7 psia), it would be less. Let me check: at 20 psia, the saturated vapor specific volume is about 4.43 ft³/lbm. Maybe I'm confusing with other pressures. Alternatively, perhaps it's 4.43 ft³/lbm.

Wait, but the initial specific volume is 0.01773 ft³/lbm, which is much lower than 4.43. So if the process is isochoric (constant volume), the specific volume remains the same. But in that case, the pressure would drop, but in this problem, the expansion is happening, so volume increases.

Wait, but in this case, the specific volume increases from 0.01773 to some higher value. So the final specific volume v2 must be greater than 0.01773.

At 20 psia, the specific volume of saturated liquid is tiny, around 0.0177 ft³/lbm. Oh wait, that's interesting. So at 20 psia, saturated liquid has v_f ≈ 0.0177 ft³/lbm, and saturated vapor v_g is around 4.43 ft³/lbm.

Wait, the initial specific volume is also 0.01773, which is very close to v_f at 20 psia. So perhaps the initial state is a compressed liquid, but wait, no. At 160 psia and 500°F, it's superheated vapor, so v1 is 0.01773. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because at 160 psia, the specific volume of saturated vapor is higher than that. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again: at 160 psia (174.7 psia), the saturation temperature is around 388°F. So at 500°F, it's superheated. The specific volume of saturated vapor at 160 psia is higher than that of the superheated steam? No, wait, in reality, as you go to higher pressures, specific volume decreases. So at 160 psia, the saturated vapor specific volume is lower than at 20 psia.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the specific volumes more accurately. Let me try to recall or reconstruct the steam table data.

At P = 160 psia (abs 174.7 psia), T_sat ≈ 388°F. For superheated steam at 500°F, the specific volume v is found by interpolating between the known values. Let's say that at 160 psia and 500°F, v is approximately 0.0177 ft³/lbm. So mass m = V1 / v1 = 0.1 / 0.0177 ≈ 5.649 lbm.

Now, for the final state at P2 = 20 psia (34.7 psia), we need to determine the specific volume v2. But without knowing the process, it's challenging. However, perhaps we can assume that the process is such that the steam expands to 20 psia and the specific volume increases. But how much?

Alternatively, perhaps the process is such that the final state is saturated vapor
