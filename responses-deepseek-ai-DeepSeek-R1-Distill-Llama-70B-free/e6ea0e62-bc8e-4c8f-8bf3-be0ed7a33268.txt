Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that there's a chamber with 5 lbm of an ideal gas. The initial temperature is 100°F. Then, the gas undergoes a reversible isobaric process, and 500 Btu of heat is added to it. I need to find the final temperature. The given properties are R = 0.0641 Btu/lbm-°R and k = 1.147. The options are A to D, with temperatures ranging from 200 to 500°F.

Hmm, okay. So, first things first, I remember that in a reversible isobaric (constant pressure) process, the heat transfer is related to the change in enthalpy. Oh right, the formula Q = m * (h2 - h1), where h is the specific enthalpy. And since the process is isobaric, the change in enthalpy depends on the temperature change.

Wait, but wait, for an ideal gas, the enthalpy depends only on temperature, right? So, the specific enthalpy h can be expressed as h = c_p * T, where c_p is the specific heat at constant pressure. But I don't have c_p directly here. Oh wait, I know that R is given, and for an ideal gas, c_p = R * (k) / (k-1), where k is the ratio of specific heats, c_p over c_v. Wait, no, wait. Or is it that k = c_p / c_v, so c_p = k * c_v. But without c_v, how can I get c_p?

Wait, another approach: Maybe I can find the change in temperature using the heat capacity. Because for an ideal gas, the change in internal energy is nR (ΔT) when it's a constant volume process, but in a constant pressure process, the heat added is n c_p R (ΔT) divided by (1 - R), no, that's getting confusing.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. For an isobaric process, Q = m * c_p * (T2 - T1). Yes, that's right. Because Q is the heat added, and since it's isobaric, it's related to the change in enthalpy. So, the equation is Q = m * c_p * (T2 - T1).

But I need to find c_p. Oh, but wait, the problem gives R (which I think is the specific gas constant, R = c_p - c_v), and k = c_p / c_v. So, with these two, I can find c_p.

So, k is c_p over c_v. Let me set c_p = k * c_v. Then, since R is c_p - c_v, substituting R = k c_v - c_v = c_v (k - 1). So, c_v = R / (k - 1). Then, c_p = k * (R / (k - 1)).

Given that R is 0.0641 Btu/lbm-°R and k is 1.147, let's compute c_p.

Calculating c_v first: c_v = R / (k-1) = 0.0641 / (1.147 - 1) = 0.0641 / 0.147 ≈ let's see, 0.0641 divided by 0.147.

Hmm, 0.147 times 0.436 is about 0.0641 (because 0.147 * 0.4 is 0.0588; 0.147*0.436 = 0.147*(0.4 + 0.03 + 0.006) = 0.0588 + 0.00441 + 0.000882 = approx 0.0641). So c_v ≈ 0.436 Btu/lbm-°R.

Then c_p = k * c_v = 1.147 * 0.436 ≈ around 0.500 Btu/lbm-°R.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 1.147 * 0.436. Let's see:

1.147 * 0.4 is 0.4588.

1.147 * 0.03 is 0.03441.

1.147 * 0.006 is 0.006882.

Adding them together: 0.4588 + 0.03441 = 0.49321 + 0.006882 = approx 0.5001. So c_p ≈ 0.5001 Btu/lbm-°R. Close enough to 0.5.

So now, going back to the heat equation. The heat added Q is 500 Btu. The mass m is 5 lbm. The initial temperature T1 is 100°F. We need to find T2.

But wait, the temperatures need to be in absolute terms because we're dealing with thermodynamic properties. So, I should convert T1 and T2 to Rankine (°R) since the gas constant R is in Btu/lbm-°R.

So, T1 = 100°F + 459.67 = 559.67 °R.

The equation is Q = m * c_p * (T2 - T1).

Plugging in the numbers:

500 = 5 * 0.5 * (T2 - 559.67).

Let me compute the right side:

5 * 0.5 = 2.5.

So 500 = 2.5 * (T2 - 559.67).

Divide both sides by 2.5: 500 / 2.5 = T2 - 559.67.

500 / 2.5 is 200. So:

200 = T2 - 559.67 → T2 = 200 + 559.67 = 759.67 °R.

Now, convert back to Fahrenheit: 759.67 - 459.67 = 300 °F.

Wait, does that make sense? So the final temperature would be 300°F, which is option D.

Wait, let me double-check the steps. Did I miss anything?

Calculating c_p: yes, with k=1.147 and R=0.0641.

c_v = R/(k-1) = 0.0641/(0.147) ≈ 0.436.

c_p = k * c_v = 1.147 * 0.436 ≈ 0.500.

Then, Q = m c_p (T2 - T1).

Q is 500 Btu, m=5 lbm, c_p=0.5.

So 500 = 5 * 0.5 * (T2 - T1).

5 * 0.5 is 2.5. So 500 / 2.5 = 200 = T2 - T1.

Wait, T1 is 100°F, which is 559.67 °R. So T2 is 559.67 + 200 = 759.67 °R → 300°F. So yeah, option D.

Wait, but another thought: when using the specific heat, for an ideal gas, the heat transfer in a constant pressure process is Q = n Cp ΔT, where n is moles, but here it's per mass, so mass times specific heat (per lbm) times ΔT.

Yes, that's correct. Since the equation I used was Q = m c_p (T2 - T1), which is correct.

So I think that's the right approach. So the answer should be D, 300°F.

To determine the final temperature of the gas after the isobaric process, we use the relationship for heat transfer in a constant pressure process:

\[
Q = m \cdot c_p \cdot (T_2 - T_1)
\]

Here:
- \( Q = 500 \, \text{Btu} \) (heat added),
- \( m = 5 \, \text{lbm} \) (mass of the gas),
- \( c_p \) is the specific heat at constant pressure,
- \( T_1 = 100^\circ \text{F} = 559.67^\circ \text{R} \) (initial temperature in Rankine),
- \( T_2 \) is the final temperature in Rankine.

The specific heat \( c_p \) can be calculated using the given gas constant \( R = 0.0641 \, \text{Btu/lbm}^\circ \text{R} \) and the ratio of specific heats \( k = 1.147 \). For an ideal gas:

\[
c_p = k \cdot c_v
\]

where \( c_v = \frac{R}{k - 1} \). Substituting \( R = 0.0641 \) and \( k = 1.147 \):

\[
c_v = \frac{0.0641}{1.147 - 1} = \frac{0.0641}{0.147} \approx 0.436 \, \text{Btu/lbm}^\circ \text{R}
\]

\[
c_p = 1.147 \cdot 0.436 \approx 0.500 \, \text{Btu/lbm}^\circ \text{R}
\]

Now, substituting into the heat transfer equation:

\[
500 = 5 \cdot 0.5 \cdot (T_2 - 559.67)
\]

Simplify:

\[
500 = 2.5 \cdot (T_2 - 559.67)
\]

\[
T_2 - 559.67 = \frac{500}{2.5} = 200
\]

\[
T_2 = 559.67 + 200 = 759.67^\circ \text{R}
\]

Convert \( T_2 \) back to Fahrenheit:

\[
T_2 = 759.67 - 459.67 = 300^\circ \text{F}
\]

Thus, the final temperature of the gas is \( 300^\circ \text{F} \), which corresponds to option D.
