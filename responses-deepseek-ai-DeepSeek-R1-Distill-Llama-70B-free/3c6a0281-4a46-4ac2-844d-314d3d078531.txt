Okay, so I've got this question about the solar nebula and the composition in terms of mass percentages. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the solar nebula was this big cloud of gas and dust that eventually formed our solar system. From what I remember, the main components were similar to the composition of the Sun, which has a lot of hydrogen and helium. Those are the light gases, right? So that's H and He.

Wait, but the question is about the ingredients of the nebula, not the Sun itself. Oh wait, I think the nebula had a similar composition because the Sun formed from it too. So the majority of the mass should be hydrogen and helium.

But wait, the options list 'light gases (H He)' as a component. So the largest mass percentage would be H and He. Then the next part. What's next in line?

I think heavier elements come next. Like, elements heavier than helium, like metals and rocks. Wait, but what about compounds like H2O, CH4, NH3? Those are hydrogen compounds. So they're made of hydrogen and other elements like oxygen, carbon, nitrogen.

So in terms of mass, the order must be: light gases first because they make up the bulk. Then, what comes next? Are the hydrogen compounds more massive than metals and rocks? Or the other way around.

Wait, in the early solar system, the nebula was mostly H and He, which are light gases. Then, the heavier elements, which include metals and silicates (rocks), would be a smaller percentage. But also, there are these hydrogen compounds like water, methane, ammonia. Those are probably less abundant than the light gases but more than the metals and rocks.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The solar nebula is thought to have been composed mostly of hydrogen and helium. The next most abundant would be the heavier elements, but they're a much smaller fraction. So maybe after H and He, the next are the metals and rocks. Or are the hydrogen compounds in between?

Wait, hydrogen compounds would contain hydrogen, but perhaps in forms like H2O, CH4, NH3. But wait, those are compounds so they include other elements. So their mass would include the mass of those other elements. But since H is the most abundant, the compounds would add to the mass of H in the nebula.

Wait, but how much of the mass is actually from these compounds versus the elemental metals and rocks.

I think the order is: light gases (H and He) make up the highest percentage. Then, the next would be the heavy elements, which are split into metals and rocks (like silicates). Or perhaps, the hydrogen compounds are a separate category and their mass may come after the light gases.

Alternatively, the heavy elements (metals and rocks) make up a smaller percentage than the hydrogen compounds. Because the hydrogen compounds include a lot of hydrogen, which is the most abundant element.

Wait, but wait. If the nebula is mostly H and He, then after that, the rest is heavier elements. But those heavier elements can be in the form of metals, rocks, and these hydrogen compounds. So perhaps the total mass of the heavy elements is less than the light gases, but more than the hydrogen compounds.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think of this in terms of what the solar nebula is made of. The solar nebula was primarily hydrogen and helium, similar to the composition of the Sun. So that would be about 70% H and 28% He by mass, roughly. The rest is heavier elements, which are about 2% or so. These heavier elements include things like carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, etc., which form compounds like water, methane, ammonia, as well as metals and silicate rocks.

So, the mass order from highest to lowest would be:

1. Light gases (H and He) â€” highest.

Then, the next part: the heavy elements. But how are they distributed between metals, rocks, and hydrogen compounds?

Wait, the heavy elements are about 2% of the total mass. Let's say that includes all the metals, rocks, and hydrogen compounds. So within that 2%, what's the order?

Hydrogen compounds would include the heavier elements bonded with hydrogen. For example, H2O has oxygen, CH4 has carbon, NH3 has nitrogen. So the mass of these compounds includes the mass of those heavier elements.

But in terms of overall mass, the majority of the hydrogen is in the light gases (H and He), not in the compounds. Because the compounds are part of the 2% heavy elements.

So, the mass order would be:

H and He (about 98% of the mass)

Then the heavy elements: which are split into metals, rocks, and hydrogen compounds. Wait, no, the heavy elements are approximately 2% of the total mass. But the options separate the components into four categories: light gases, hydrogen compounds, metals, rocks.

So, within the heavy elements (2% of total), the order would be:

Which is more massive in the nebula: the hydrogen compounds (like water, ammonia) or the metals and rocks?

Wait, I'm a bit stuck here. Let's think of it this way: the solar nebula was a cloud that formed the Sun and the planets. The Sun is mostly H and He. The planets, especially the outer ones, have a lot of ices like water, ammonia, methane. So the ices (hydrogen compounds) are a part of the nebula. The rocky material is more in the inner solar system.

So the mass of the nebula would have H and He as the largest component, then the next would be the ices (hydrogen compounds), followed by metals and rocks.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because the metals and rocks (heavy elements) are a small percentage, but perhaps the ices (hydrogen compounds) are a larger portion than metals and rocks.

Wait, but the metals and rocks are part of the 2% heavy elements. The ices (hydrogen compounds) are part of that 2% as well. So which is more? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogen compounds are a bigger chunk than metals and rocks because they include more hydrogen. Wait, but the hydrogen in the compounds is part of the heavy elements because the compounds include heavier atoms. So perhaps the hydrogen compounds are the next biggest after H and He.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let's think about the composition of comets, which are remnants of the nebula. Comets have a lot of ices: water, methane, ammonia. So that suggests that the nebula had a significant amount of these hydrogen compounds.

But in terms of mass, how does that compare to metals and rocks?

Another approach: The nebula's composition by mass was about 70% H, 28% He, and ~2% heavier elements. The heavier elements include oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, etc. Now, in the form of compounds, how much mass do they contribute?

So, the light gases (H and He) are first. Then, the next would be the heavier elements, which are split into components like hydrogen compounds, metals, and rocks.

Wait, but all the heavier elements are in the 2% category. So, the largest component after H and He would be the heavy elements, which include the hydrogen compounds.

Wait, no. Because the options list the hydrogen compounds as a separate category. So the order is: light gases, then hydrogen compounds, then metals, then rocks.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the hydrogen in the hydrogen compounds is part of the heavier elements because the compounds include heavier atoms. So the mass of the hydrogen compounds would be part of the 2% heavy elements. So, within that 2%, the order would be: perhaps hydrogen compounds > metals and rocks.

So the overall order would be: light gases (H He) first, then hydrogen compounds (H2O, etc.), then metals, then rocks.

Wait, but some options have metals and rocks after each other. Let me look at the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option B: light gases, hydrogen compounds, metals, rocks.

Option H: light gases, hydrogen compounds, rocks, metals.

Wait, but I'm not certain whether metals are more massive than rocks in the nebula.

Wait, metals are elements like iron, nickel, etc. Rocks are silicates, which contain more oxygen and silicon. So perhaps in the solar nebula, silicates (rocks) are more abundant than pure metals.

Because the heavier elements include O, Si, Fe, etc. So oxygen is the third most abundant element in the universe, after H and He. So silicates (rocks) would be more abundant than metals.

So, in the 2% heavy elements, the order might be: hydrogen compounds (like H2O, which includes O, which is more abundant than metals), followed by rocks (silicates), then metals.

Wait, but wait. The hydrogen compounds are made of H and heavier elements. So the mass of hydrogen compounds would include both the H and the heavier elements. But in the overall nebula, the H in compounds is a small fraction compared to the elemental H and He.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass of the hydrogen compounds (like H2O, etc.) would be a larger portion than the metals and rocks because they contain more hydrogen, but in the context of the entire nebula, their contribution is still smaller than H and He.

So, the order from highest to lowest mass would be:

1. Light gases (H and He) â€” 98% of mass.

2. Heavy elements: which would include hydrogen compounds, metals, and rocks.

But among the heavy elements, which is more? Hydrogen compounds would have more mass than metals and rocks because they contain H, which is abundant. But wait, in the heavy elements (2% of the total mass), the majority would be O, C, N, etc. So the hydrogen compounds would be part of that 2%. So within that 2%, perhaps the order is hydrogen compounds > rocks > metals.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me try to approach it step by step.

The solar nebula's composition by mass is mostly H and He. The next components are the heavier elements, which include:

- Hydrogen compounds (like H2O, CH4, NH3)
- Metals (like Fe, Ni)
- Rocks (silicates, which include O, Si, etc.)

So, in terms of mass percentages, the order should be:

- Light gases (H He) as the highest.

Then, the heavy elements in some order. Now, the heavy elements (2%) include all of these, but which is more in mass?

Hydrogen compounds would have more mass than metals and rocks because they include more H. But wait, the H in the compounds is part of the heavy elements category, not the light gases. So perhaps the largest component in the heavy elements is the hydrogen compounds.

Wait, maybe not. Because the heavy elements are only 2% of the mass. In the heavy elements, the largest part would be oxygen, as it's the third most abundant element. So, perhaps the rocks (silicates) are the next biggest after the light gases, followed by hydrogen compounds, then metals.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Another approach: looking for the correct order in the options.

Looking at the options:

Option B: light gases, hydrogen compounds, metals, rocks.

Option H: light gases, hydrogen compounds, rocks, metals.

Wait, but earlier I thought that rocks (silicates) are more abundant than metals. So in the heavy elements, rocks (which include O, Si) are more massive than metals. So in that case, after light gases, the order would be:

1. Light gases (H He)

2. Heavy elements: rocks, then metals, then hydrogen compounds?

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the hydrogen compounds would include H, which is part of the heavy elements. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is light gases, then hydrogen compounds, then metals, then rocks.

Wait, no, that can't be right because rocks (silicates) are more abundant than metals.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is light gases, then hydrogen compounds, then rocks, then metals. Because rocks are more abundant than metals.

Looking at the options, option B is light gases, hydrogen compounds, metals, rocks.

Option H is light gases, hydrogen compounds, rocks, metals.

So if rocks are more abundant than metals, then option H would have the correct order.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is light gases (H He) first, then metals, then rocks, then hydrogen compounds. But that doesn't seem right because hydrogen compounds would have more mass due to including H.

Wait, another way: considering that the heavy elements are in the order of decreasing abundance: O, C, N, etc. So in the solar nebula, O is the most abundant heavy element. So rocks (silicates) would have a lot of O and Si. So rocks would be more abundant than metals.

So, in the heavy elements, the order is rocks, then hydrogen compounds (like H2O, which includes O), then metals. Wait, but that's considering only the heavy elements' composition.

But the question is about the entire nebula's mass. So the order starts with H and He, then the next is the heavy elements, which include all the rest. So the heavy elements would be split into their components.

But perhaps the total mass of the heavy elements is 2%, so within that, which component is more? Rocks (silicates) would be more massive than hydrogen compounds and metals.

Wait, but that can't be because the hydrogen in the compounds is part of the nebula's mass. No, wait, the H in the compounds is part of the heavy elements because the compounds are made of heavier elements plus H. So the mass of the hydrogen compounds would be part of the 2% heavy elements.

Hmm, this is getting tricky. Maybe I should think about the cosmic abundance of elements.

The cosmic abundance (by mass) is roughly: H (70%), He (28%), O (0.9%), C (0.2%), N (0.1%), Fe (0.1%), etc. So O is the most abundant heavy element, followed by C, then N, then metals like Fe.

So, in the heavy elements (about 2% total), O is the highest, followed by C, then N, then metals.

Now, the hydrogen compounds would include O, C, N. So the mass of the hydrogen compounds would be higher than metals because O, C, N are more abundant in the universe.

So, in terms of mass contribution within the heavy elements: rocks (silicates, which have O and Si) would be a larger component than hydrogen compounds, which include O, C, N bonded with H. Wait, perhaps not, because the hydrogen compounds' mass includes H, which is more abundant. But the H in these compounds is part of the heavy elements' mass? No, the H in the compounds is part of the light elements because H is light. Wait, no. The compounds are considered in the heavy elements category because they contain heavier atoms.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should think in terms of what the options are.

The correct order should be: light gases (H He) > hydrogen compounds (H2O, etc.) > metals > rocks.

Wait, no, because in the heavy elements, rocks (silicates) are more abundant than metals.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is: light gases (H He) > rocks > metals > hydrogen compounds. No, that doesn't make sense because the hydrogen compounds include O, which is more abundant than metals.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is:

1. Light gases (H He)
2. Hydrogen compounds (because H is in them, but they're part of the heavy elements)
3. Rocks (silicates, which have O and Si)
4. Metals (Fe, etc.)

Wait, but that would place hydrogen compounds higher than rocks, which may not be correct because the rocks have O, which is more abundant than the components in hydrogen compounds.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of the options again.

Looking at the options, the correct order is likely light gases first, then hydrogen compounds, then metals, then rocks? Or light gases, then hydrogen compounds, then rocks, then metals.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is light gases, then rocks, then metals, then hydrogen compounds. No, that doesn't make sense because the hydrogen compounds include O, which is more abundant than metals.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Light gases (H He)
2. Heavy elements in the order of their abundance: O (in rocks and hydrogen compounds), then C, N, etc.

But I'm not sure how that translates into the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct order in the options is B: light gases, hydrogen compounds, metals, rocks.

Wait, but rocks are likely more abundant than metals. So perhaps option H is correct: light gases, hydrogen compounds, rocks, metals.

But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, another angle: the solar nebula is thought to have had more ices (hydrogen compounds) in the outer regions, and rocky material closer in. But in terms of mass percentage, I think the light gases dominate, followed by the heavy elements. Within the heavy elements, the order might be rocks, then hydrogen compounds, then metals. Because O is more abundant than C and N.

Wait, but how much do the hydrogen compounds contribute? If O is the most abundant heavy element, then rocks (silicates) would have more mass than the hydrogen compounds.

Wait, but the hydrogen compounds include H, which is light. So the mass of the hydrogen compounds would be higher than just the O, C, N in them. Because each molecule of H2O includes two H atoms along with O. But in the heavy elements, only the O is part of that 2% mass. The H in the compounds is part of the light gases, right? No, wait, no. The H in the compounds is part of the heavy elements category because it's bound to heavier elements. Or is it?

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me try to clarify.

In the solar nebula, the mass is primarily H (as H2) and He. The next elements are O, C, N, etc. The H in compounds like H2O is part of the heavy elements because they're part of the heavier molecules. So the mass of the hydrogen compounds includes the H in them, which is part of the 2% heavy elements.

If that's the case, then the mass of the hydrogen compounds would be higher than the mass of metals and rocks because they include more H, but this H is part of the heavy elements. But wait, no, because the H in the compounds is part of the heavy elements, but the majority of the H is still in the light gases.

Wait, perhaps the order is:

1. Light gases (H He) â€” highest mass.

2. Heavy elements, which include:

   a. Hydrogen compounds (H2O, etc.) â€” their mass includes O, C, N, plus H.

   b. Rocks (silicates) â€” O, Si, etc.
