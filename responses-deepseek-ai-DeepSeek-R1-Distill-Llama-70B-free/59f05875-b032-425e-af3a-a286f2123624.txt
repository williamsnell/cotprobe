Question:

This question refers to the following information.
I walk alongside the column, ask what's going on.
A soldier says simply: "They call up more every day.
"Some of us were sent north to the Yellow River at age fifteen,
And now at forty we're heading off to the garrisons in the west.
On our first tour, the village headman had to tie our bandannas for us.
When we came back, our hair was white, but still there's more unrest.
The frontier garrisons run with blood, enough to fill an ocean,
But the Martial Emperor's territorial ambitions have yet to crest.
In the hundred districts east of the mountains, throughout the land of Han,
There must be ten thousand villages that brambles now infest.
Even if wives are strong enough to handle a hoe and plow,
The crops grow every which way, the fields are all a mess.
It's hardest for the Shanxi men, with their reputations as fighters:
They're rounded up like dogs or chickens, every male impressed.
"But sir, though it's good of you to ask,
Complaining isn't part of the soldier's task.
We can only shake our heads. Take this winter:
The Shanxi troops were never sent home.
The District Officers are demanding the land tax,
But where will it come from? You can't get blood from a stone!
I honestly think it's bad luck to bear a son now,
It's better to have a daughter: at least she can marry
And live with the neighbors next door.
But a son will end up lying on some distant prairie."
Du Fu, "Ballad of the Army Carts," ca. 750 C.E.

Okay, so I've got this question about a poem by Du Fu, and I need to figure out what it says about gender relations in Tang society. Let me read through the poem carefully.

The poem is called "Ballad of the Army Carts," written around 750 CE. It's about soldiers being conscripted and the hardships they face. The question is asking what this tells us about gender relations at the time.

Looking at the poem, I see that soldiers are being taken from their villages. One part says, "some of us were sent north to the Yellow River at age fifteen, and now at forty we're heading off to the garrisons in the west." That shows how long and tough military service was, which probably took men away from their families for a long time.

Then there's a part where the soldier says, "It's hardest for the Shanxi men, with their reputations as fighters: They're rounded up like dogs or chickens, every male impressed." This implies that men, especially from certain regions, were being conscripted heavily. The use of "rounded up" suggests it's not voluntary and that it's a significant burden on the families left behind.

The poem also talks about the impact on the villages. It mentions that the frontier garrisons are filled with blood, and the emperor's ambitions are high, leading to constant unrest. The villages back home are in disarray, with brambles infesting the land because the men are away fighting.

A significant part for gender relations is when the soldier says, "Even if wives are strong enough to handle a hoe and plow, The crops grow every which way, the fields are all a mess." Here, it's clear that women are taking on agricultural work, which was traditionally done by men. So, women are stepping into roles outside the home, at least in farming, because the men are away.

Another line is, "I honestly think it's bad luck to bear a son now, It's better to have a daughter: at least she can marry And live with the neighbors next door. But a son will end up lying on some distant prairie." This shows a shift in preference for having daughters over sons because sons are taken away for military service and may not return. Daughters can marry and stay nearby, which might be seen as more beneficial in this context.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Women had limited roles outside the home. But the poem shows women handling the hoe and plow, so this contradicts A.

Option B: Imperial rescripts emphasized sons over daughters for conscription. The poem doesn't mention imperial policies directly, just the soldiers' experiences, so this might not be the best fit.

Option C: Agricultural work could be shared by women and men. The poem shows women doing this work because men are away, so this suggests that it's possible for women to share in the work, supporting C.

Option D: Women were encouraged to become soldiers. There's no mention of women soldiers here, so D is unlikely.

Option E: Gender relations reversed under Empress Wu. The poem doesn't reference her or any such change, so E is probably not right.

Option F: Birth of a daughter was seen as a misfortune. Actually, the poem says the oppositeâ€”the speaker thinks it's better to have a daughter, so F is incorrect.

Option G: Men responsible for household, women in fields. The poem shows women in fields because men are away, but it doesn't say men were responsible for the household normally. So G might not be accurate.

Option H: Confucian relationships were still strong. The poem doesn't directly address Confucian values, so H is less likely.

So, the best evidence is that women were handling agricultural work, which was typically done by men. This shows that the work could be shared, which aligns with option C.

The poem "Ballad of the Army Carts" by Du Fu highlights the impact of military conscription on Tang society, particularly on gender roles. It describes how men are taken away for prolonged military service, leaving women to manage agricultural work traditionally handled by men. The lines "Even if wives are strong enough to handle a hoe and plow, The crops grow every which way, the fields are all a mess" illustrate that women are stepping into these roles due to the absence of men. This suggests that agricultural work could be shared by women and men in Tang society.

Option C is the best answer because it directly reflects the evidence in the poem that women were taking on agricultural responsibilities alongside men, even if the circumstances were forced by the men's absence.

Answer: C
