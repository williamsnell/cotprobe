Okay, so I have this physics problem here about oscillators and standing waves. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. Alright, let me read it again.

The question says that an oscillator emits high-frequency waves at 0.26 GHz in front of a large plane metal reflector. Standing waves are formed with nodes 57.5 cm apart. I need to find the velocity of light, ignoring the refractive index of air. The options are from A to J.

Wait, standing waves. Oh right, when you have a standing wave between a source and a reflector, the distance between nodes can tell you something about the wavelength. I remember that in standing waves, nodes are points where there's destructive interference. So for a standing wave pattern, the distance between consecutive nodes is half the wavelength, right? Because the wave reflects and interferes with itself.

So the node separation is 57.5 cm. That should be lambda over 2. So lambda = 2 * node separation. Let me calculate that. 57.5 cm multiplied by 2 is 115 cm. So wavelength is 115 cm. Or wait, wait—wait, nodes are every half wavelength apart. So if they're 57.5 cm apart, that's lambda/2. So yeah, lambda is 115 cm.

Wait, but wait. In some cases, like when you have a fixed end and an open end, the node spacing is different. Wait, no, wait. In this case, the oscillator is in front of a metal reflector. So the reflector is a perfect conductor, which means it's a fixed end. The oscillator itself, I think, is a source that can be considered as a fixed end as well? Or maybe not. Wait, no, the oscillator is like a source emitting waves towards the reflector, which reflects them. So the setup is like two fixed ends? Or one fixed and one free?

Wait, no. When a wave hits a reflector, like a metal surface, it's a fixed end because the electric field must be zero there. So the wave reflects, and the boundary condition is that the electric field is zero at the surface. So that's a node. For a standing wave in such a setup, the distance from the oscillator to the reflector would determine the possible wavelengths. The oscillator itself might be acting as a source that's not necessarily a node, but for standing waves, the ends are nodes.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the standing wave formed between the oscillator and the reflector. The oscillator is emitting waves that go to the reflector and bounce back. So the superposition of the incident and reflected waves forms a standing wave.

In such a case, the distance between the oscillator and the reflector is L, and the standing wave has nodes separated by lambda/2. So if the nodes are 57.5 cm apart, that's lambda/2. So lambda is 115 cm, right.

But wait, how are the nodes arranged? Let me think. The reflector is at one end (a node), and the oscillator is at some position. The standing wave pattern would have nodes at positions where the electric field is zero. So the distance between two nodes would be lambda/2.

So if the nodes are 57.5 cm apart, that's half a wavelength. So the wavelength lambda is twice that—115 cm.

Now, the oscillator's frequency is given as 0.26 GHz. Wait, GHz is gigahertz, which is 1e9 Hz. So 0.26 GHz is 0.26e9 Hz. Let me write that as 2.6e8 Hz.

The velocity of a wave is given by v = f * lambda. So if I have f and lambda, I can compute v.

Wait, but the question is about the velocity of light. Oh, right, because these are electromagnetic waves, so their speed in air is approximately the speed of light, c. So v equals c, which is what we're to compute here.

So let's plug in the numbers.

f = 0.26 GHz = 0.26e9 Hz = 2.6e8 Hz.
lambda = 115 cm = 115e2 meters? Wait, no, wait—wait, actually, velocity is usually in meters per second. Hmm, since the wavelength is in centimeters, perhaps it's better to convert everything to cm or to meters. Let me think.

Wait, velocity in cm/sec. The options are in cm/sec. So maybe working in cm is easier.

So lambda is 115 cm.
f is 0.26 GHz = 0.26e9 Hz.

Wait, 1 GHz is 1e9 Hz, so 0.26 GHz is 0.26 * 1e9 = 2.6e8 Hz.

So v = f * lambda.

v = (2.6e8 Hz) * (115 cm).

Let me compute that. 2.6e8 multiplied by 115.

2.6 * 115 = ?

Wait, 2 * 115 is 230, 0.6 * 115 is 69. So 230+69=299. So 2.6e8 * 115 = 299e8 cm/s.

Wait, 2.6e8 is 260,000,000. 260,000,000 * 115 = ?

Wait 260,000,000 * 100 = 26,000,000,000
260,000,000 * 15= 3,900,000,000
Total: 29,900,000,000 cm/s.

Which is 2.99e10 cm/s.

Looking at the options, option E is 2.99e10 cm/sec. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but let me double-check. Are the nodes correctly calculated as lambda/2?

Yes, because in a standing wave, the distance between two consecutive nodes is half a wavelength. So if the nodes are 57.5 cm apart, that's lambda/2. So lambda is 115 cm.

Then v = f * lambda.

f is 0.26 GHz, which is 0.26e9 Hz.

So 0.26e9 * 115 cm = 0.26 * 115 * 1e9 cm/s.

0.26 * 115 is 29.9, so 29.9e9 cm/s = 2.99e10 cm/s. Yep, that's correct.

So the velocity is 2.99e10 cm/s, which is option E.

To solve the problem, we analyze the standing wave formed between the oscillator and the reflector. The nodes in the standing wave are 57.5 cm apart, which corresponds to half the wavelength (\( \lambda/2 \)). Thus, the wavelength is:

\[
\lambda = 2 \times 57.5 \, \text{cm} = 115 \, \text{cm}.
\]

The oscillator emits waves at a frequency of \( 0.26 \, \text{GHz} \), which is equivalent to:

\[
f = 0.26 \times 10^9 \, \text{Hz} = 2.6 \times 10^8 \, \text{Hz}.
\]

The velocity of the wave (\( v \)) is given by the product of the frequency and the wavelength:

\[
v = f \cdot \lambda.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
v = (2.6 \times 10^8 \, \text{Hz}) \cdot (115 \, \text{cm}) = 2.99 \times 10^{10} \, \text{cm/s}.
\]

Thus, the velocity of light is \( 2.99 \times 10^{10} \, \text{cm/s} \), which corresponds to option **E**.
