Question:

A rancher, being owner in fee simpleconveyed the property by warranty deed to a woman. The woman gave her niece a mortgage on the ranch to secure a loan from the niece to the woman in the amount of $500,000. The mortgage was recorded immediately. Two years later, the woman conveyed the ranch to a farmer by quitclaim deed. The woman then defaulted on the mortgage, and the niece brought an in personam action against the farmer to recover the amount of the mortgage due. Assume that the woman's quitclaim deed to the farmer made no reference to the mortgage. The woman then defaulted on the mortgage, and the niece brought an in personam action against the farmer to recover the amount of the mortgage due. The mortgagee will probably

Options:

A: succeed, because the mortgage was recorded immediately.
B: not succeed, because the quitclaim deed did not reference the mortgage.
C: succeed, because an implied delegation of duties resulted from the woman's conveyance to the farmer.
D: not succeed, because the farmer was not a party to the original mortgage contract.
E: succeed, because the quitclaim deed does not absolve the farmer of the mortgage debt.
F: not succeed, unless the farmer had constructive notice of the existence of the mortgage.
G: succeed, because the niece was a third-party beneficiary under the conveyance between the woman and the farmer.
H: not succeed, because the woman was still legally responsible for the mortgage debt.
I: not succeed, because the farmer did not promise to pay the mortgage debt.
J: succeed, because the farmer implicitly accepted responsibility for the mortgage by accepting the quitclaim deed.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here about mortgages and deeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on property law, but let's think it through.

So the setup: A rancher conveyed property via a warranty deed to a woman. That means the woman owns it outright, right? Then the woman got a $500k loan from her niece, and the niece took a mortgage on the ranch as security. The mortgage was recorded immediately. So the niece has a recorded mortgage, which probably makes her a secured creditor.

Two years later, the woman conveys the ranch to a farmer using a quitclaim deed. Wait, what's a quitclaim deed? Oh right, it's a deed that transfers whatever interest the grantor has, but doesn't make any warranties. So the farmer gets whatever the woman had, but if she had a mortgage, maybe that comes along?

The woman then defaults on the mortgage, and the niece sues the farmer in personam to recover the mortgage amount. So the niece is trying to hold the farmer personally responsible for the mortgage debt.

I remember that when a property is sold, especially with a mortgage, the new owner (here, the farmer) might be subject to the mortgage if it's a purchase money mortgage, but I'm not sure. Wait, the niece is the mortgagee, and the mortgage was recorded before the conveyance to the farmer.

But wait, the woman conveyed by quitclaim. Did she have any equity left? If the mortgage was for $500k and the property's value is unknown, but the point is, the mortgage is still on the property.

So the question is whether the farmer is personally liable for the woman's mortgage debt. Generally, when you take property subject to a mortgage, you don't become personally liable for the debt unless you've explicitly assumed it. I think that's the key point here.

The mortgage was recorded, so the farmer would have constructive notice of it, right? But does that make the farmer personally liable? Or does it just mean the property is still encumbered?

So when the woman conveyed the property, the farmer takes it subject to the mortgage. That means if the woman defaults, the niece can foreclose on the property. But does that make the farmer personally liable? I don't think so unless there's an assumption of the mortgage.

In this case, the quitclaim deed didn't mention the mortgage. So the farmer didn't assume the mortgage debt. Therefore, the farmer isn't personally liable. The niece can go after the property, but not the farmer personally.

So the niece is suing in personam, which is against the person. Since the farmer didn't assume the debt, the niece can't recover from the farmer personally. She can only go after the property, which would be an in rem action, I think.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Succeed because recorded. But recording makes the mortgage enforceable against the property, not necessarily the new owner personally.

Option B: Not succeed because no reference. Hmm, maybe, but the lack of reference might mean no assumption.

Option C: Implied delegation? I don't think so. Delegation usually requires some agreement.

Option D: Farmer wasn't a party. That's true, the mortgage was between the woman and niece.

Option E: Quitclaim doesn't absolve? Wait, the farmer isn't absolved of the mortgage debt, but did he take on the debt? No, unless he assumed it.

Option F: Unless farmer had constructive notice. But I think even with notice, without assumption, he's not liable.

Option H: Woman still responsible. Yes, because she's the one who took the loan. So the niece can go after her, but not the farmer.

Option I: Farmer didn't promise. Exactly, no assumption, so no personal liability.

So the correct answer would be that the niece doesn't succeed because the farmer didn't assume the debt. So looking at the options, I think it's either D, F, H, or I.

Wait, the question says the niece brought an in personam action against the farmer. The farmer isn't personally liable because he didn't assume the mortgage. So the niece can't get a personal judgment against him. Therefore, the action won't succeed.

Looking at the options:

D says not succeed because farmer wasn't a party. That's correct because the mortgage was between the woman and niece. The farmer, as a third party, didn't agree to take on that debt.

I says not succeed because farmer didn't promise. That's also correct, but D is more about not being a party. But I think the reason here is that without assuming the debt, the farmer isn't liable. So the in personam action fails because there's no privity; the farmer didn't agree to the debt.

Wait, but another angle: sometimes when property is transferred, the grantee may be required to satisfy the mortgage if they're using the property. But I think that's more about being subject to foreclosure, not personal liability.

So I think the correct answer is either D or I. Let me think again. The key issue is whether the farmer is personally liable for the debt. Since he didn't assume it, he isn't. So the niece can't get an in personam judgment against him.

So looking at the options, D says not succeed because farmer wasn't a party. I says not succeed because farmer didn't promise to pay.

I think I is the correct reason. Because it's about the farmer not having assumed the debt. The mortgage was a contract between the woman and niece; the farmer didn't agree to it, so he can't be held personally liable.

So the answer would be I: not succeed because the farmer didn't promise to pay the mortgage debt.

The question revolves around whether the farmer can be held personally liable for the mortgage debt after the woman conveyed the ranch to him via a quitclaim deed. The key issue is that the farmer did not assume the mortgage debt, as the quitclaim deed made no reference to it. Under property law, a grantee who takes property subject to a mortgage does not become personally liable for the debt unless they explicitly assume it. In this case, the farmer did not assume the mortgage, and the quitclaim deed only transferred whatever interest the woman had, which was encumbered by the mortgage.

The niece, as the mortgagee, can enforce the mortgage against the property (an in rem action), but cannot pursue an in personam action against the farmer because he did not agree to pay the debt. The farmer’s lack of personal liability stems from the fact that he did not promise to pay the mortgage debt, and the mortgage was a contract between the woman and the niece.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, E, G, J**: Incorrect because they imply personal liability on the farmer, which does not apply here.
- **B, C, F**: Incorrect because they focus on issues like constructive notice or implied delegation, which are not relevant to the farmer’s personal liability.
- **D, H**: While partially correct, they are less precise than **I**, which directly addresses the lack of personal liability due to the absence of a promise by the farmer.
- **I**: Correct because it accurately reflects that the farmer did not promise to pay the mortgage debt, making him not personally liable.

Thus, the niece’s in personam action against the farmer will not succeed because the farmer did not assume the mortgage debt.

**Answer: I**
