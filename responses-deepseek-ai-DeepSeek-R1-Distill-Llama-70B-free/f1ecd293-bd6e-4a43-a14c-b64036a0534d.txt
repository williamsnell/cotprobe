Okay, so I have this limit problem to solve. The question is the limit as x approaches 9 of (x-9)/(sqrt(x) - 3). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

I remember that when I see a limit where plugging in the value directly leads to a 0/0 indeterminate form, I can try factoring or rationalizing. Let me check what happens if I plug in x=9. The numerator becomes 9-9=0, and the denominator is sqrt(9)-3=3-3=0. So yeah, it's 0/0, which is indeterminate. That means I can't just plug in; I need another method.

One method I know is to rationalize the denominator. Maybe if I multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The denominator is sqrt(x) - 3, so its conjugate is sqrt(x) + 3. Let's try that.

Multiply both numerator and denominator by (sqrt(x) + 3):

[(x - 9)(sqrt(x) + 3)] / [(sqrt(x) - 3)(sqrt(x) + 3)]

The denominator simplifies using the difference of squares: (sqrt(x))^2 - (3)^2 = x - 9.

So now the expression becomes:

[(x - 9)(sqrt(x) + 3)] / (x - 9)

Ah, I see that (x-9) cancels out in numerator and denominator, but wait, does that mean anything? Well, as long as x isn't 9, which it isn't because we're taking the limit as x approaches 9, so we're allowed to cancel them.

So after canceling, we have sqrt(x) + 3. Now, we can directly substitute x=9 into this simplified expression.

sqrt(9) is 3, so 3 + 3 = 6.

Wait, so the limit is 6. Let me double-check that I didn't make a mistake. Did I handle the algebra correctly? Let me go through it again.

Original expression: (x-9)/(sqrt(x)-3). Multiply numerator and denominator by (sqrt(x)+3), which gives (x-9)(sqrt(x)+3)/(x - 9), since denominator becomes (x - 9). Then the (x-9) terms cancel, leaving sqrt(x)+3. Plugging in x=9: sqrt(9)=3, so 3+3=6. Yeah, that seems right.

Alternatively, I could have factored the numerator. Let me try that approach to confirm. The numerator is x-9, which is (sqrt(x))^2 - 3^2. So that factors into (sqrt(x)-3)(sqrt(x)+3). So the original expression becomes (sqrt(x)-3)(sqrt(x)+3)/(sqrt(x)-3). Then, again, sqrt(x)-3 cancels, leaving sqrt(x)+3, which at x=9 is 6. Same result.

So both methods lead me to 6. Therefore, the answer should be option C, which is 6.

To solve the limit \(\lim_{x \to 9} \frac{x - 9}{\sqrt{x} - 3}\), we recognize that directly substituting \(x = 9\) results in the indeterminate form \(0/0\). To resolve this, we can rationalize the denominator by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, \(\sqrt{x} + 3\):

\[
\frac{(x - 9)(\sqrt{x} + 3)}{(\sqrt{x} - 3)(\sqrt{x} + 3)}.
\]

The denominator simplifies as a difference of squares:

\[
(\sqrt{x} - 3)(\sqrt{x} + 3) = x - 9.
\]

This allows the numerator and denominator to cancel the \(x - 9\) term (valid for \(x \neq 9\)):

\[
\frac{(x - 9)(\sqrt{x} + 3)}{x - 9} = \sqrt{x} + 3.
\]

Now, we substitute \(x = 9\) into the simplified expression:

\[
\sqrt{9} + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6.
\]

Thus, the limit is 6. Both rationalizing the denominator and factoring the numerator confirm this result. The correct answer is:

**C: 6**
