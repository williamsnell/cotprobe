Okay, so I've got this problem here about a manufacturer selling merchandise and figuring out the percentage gain. Hmm, let's see. The question says the manufacturer sells at 135% of the cost. I need to find the percent of gain.

Wait, I remember that percentage gain is calculated based on the cost price. So, if something is sold above the cost, the profit is the selling price minus the cost. Then, to get the percentage, you divide that profit by the cost and multiply by 100.

So, let me break it down. Let's say the cost price is $100. That makes calculations easier, right? Because percentages are easier to handle with 100 as a base. So, if the cost is $100, then 135% of that would be the selling price. 

Calculating 135% of 100 is straightforward. 100 plus 35% of 100. 35% of 100 is 35, so the selling price is $135. 

Now, the gain or profit is selling price minus cost. So that's 135 - 100 = $35. 

To find the percentage gain, I take the profit, which is $35, divide by the cost, which is $100. So 35 divided by 100 is 0.35. Multiply by 100 to get the percentage, which is 35%.

Wait, does that make sense? So the gain is 35% of the cost. That seems right. Because he sold it for 35% more than he bought it for.

So looking at the options, option A is 35%. So the answer should be A.

I think that's correct. Let me double-check. If cost is C, selling price is 1.35C. Profit is 0.35C. So profit percentage is (0.35C/C)*100 = 35%. Yep, that's solid.

The manufacturer's selling price is 135% of the cost, which means the selling price is 1.35 times the cost price (C). The profit is calculated as:

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} = 1.35C - C = 0.35C
\]

The percentage gain is then calculated by dividing the profit by the cost price and multiplying by 100:

\[
\text{Percentage Gain} = \left( \frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{0.35C}{C} \right) \times 100 = 35\%
\]

Thus, the manufacturer's percent of gain is **35%**.
