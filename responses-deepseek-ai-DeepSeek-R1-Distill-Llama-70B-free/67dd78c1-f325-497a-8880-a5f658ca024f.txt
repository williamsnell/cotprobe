Question:

Mr. Errol makes deliveries by bicycle for a living and earns $200 a week. He is currently taxed at a rate of 20%. Be-cause of his superior work record, his boss gave Mr. Errol a $10 raise in pay. Mr. Errol is excited, but does not realize that this raise in pay puts him in a 25% tax bracket. a) How much of an increase in take-home salary does this raise amount to? b) Discuss Mr. Errol's marginal tax rate.

Options:

A: Increase in pay of $2.50, Marginal tax rate of 20%
B: Drop in pay of $10, Marginal tax rate of 200%
C: Increase in pay of $5, Marginal tax rate of 25%
D: Drop in pay of $5, Marginal tax rate of 75%
E: Increase in pay of $2.50, Marginal tax rate of 50%
F: Drop in pay of $2.50, Marginal tax rate of 125%
G: Increase in pay of $7.50, Marginal tax rate of 20%
H: No change in pay, Marginal tax rate of 25%
I: Increase in pay of $7.50, Marginal tax rate of 25%
J: Increase in pay of $10, Marginal tax rate of 25%

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where Mr. Errol gets a $10 raise, but his tax bracket changes. Hmm, let me break this down.

First, I need to understand his original situation. He earns $200 a week and is taxed at 20%. So, his original tax would be 20% of 200, which is $40. That means his take-home pay is $200 - $40 = $160.

Now, he gets a $10 raise, making his new weekly pay $210. But wait, the tax bracket changes to 25%. I'm a bit confused about how tax brackets work. I think it's not that the entire income is taxed at the higher rate, just the amount that falls into the new bracket. So, maybe up to a certain point is taxed at 20%, and the rest at 25%.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the tax brackets' thresholds. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the entire income is now taxed at 25% because of the raise. Let me think again.

If the original $200 was taxed at 20%, and the new amount is $210 taxed at 25%, then the new tax would be 25% of 210, which is $52.50. So his new take-home pay is $210 - $52.50 = $157.50.

Wait, that can't be right because that would mean his take-home pay decreased. Let me see the options. Oh wait, maybe the tax bracket applies only to the amount exceeding the previous limit. Suppose the tax brackets are set so that the first, say, $200 is taxed at 20%, and anything above that is taxed at 25%. So the $10 raise would have $10 taxed at 25%.

So original tax: 20% of 200 = $40. New tax: 20% of 200 + 25% of 10. That would be $40 + $2.50 = $42.50. Take-home pay would be $210 - $42.50 = $167.50.

His original take-home was $160, so the increase is $7.50. So part a) would be an increase of $7.50.

As for part b), the marginal tax rate is the rate on the last dollar earned. Since the $10 is taxed at 25%, his marginal tax rate is 25%.

Looking at the options, option I says increase of $7.50 and marginal rate 25%. Option C says increase of $5 and marginal 25%, which doesn't match. Option G has $7.50 but marginal 20%, which is wrong.

So, the correct answer should be option I.

To determine the impact of Mr. Errol's $10 raise, we analyze both his take-home pay and marginal tax rate. Originally, he earned $200/week with a 20% tax rate, resulting in a take-home pay of $160. After the raise, his income is $210, but the tax rate increases to 25%. 

Assuming the tax brackets apply such that the first $200 is taxed at 20% and the additional $10 at 25%, the new tax is calculated as:
\[
\text{New Tax} = (20\% \times 200) + (25\% \times 10) = 40 + 2.50 = \$42.50
\]
Thus, his new take-home pay is:
\[
210 - 42.50 = \$167.50
\]
The increase in take-home pay is:
\[
167.50 - 160 = \$7.50
\]

For part b), the marginal tax rate is the tax rate applied to the last dollar earned, which is 25% for the $10 raise.

The correct answer is **I: Increase in pay of $7.50, Marginal tax rate of 25%**.
