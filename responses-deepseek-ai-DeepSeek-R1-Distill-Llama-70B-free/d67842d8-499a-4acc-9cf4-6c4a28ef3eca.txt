Question:

The cells of humans and most animals have become adapted to surviving only within a relatively small range of hydrogen ion concentrations. What is the role of the kidneys in regulating hydrogen ion concentration?

Options:

A: The kidneys filter out hydrogen ions and recycle them into other cellular processes.
B: The kidneys regulate the hydrogen ion concentration of the extracellular fluids by excreting either acidic or basic constituents when the levels deviate from normal.
C: The kidneys maintain a constant production of hydrogen ions, regardless of the body's needs.
D: The kidneys produce hydrogen ions to maintain balance.
E: The kidneys eliminate all hydrogen ions from the body.
F: The kidneys detect hydrogen ion levels and signal other organs to adjust their pH levels accordingly.
G: The kidneys release enzymes that directly neutralize hydrogen ions in the bloodstream.
H: The kidneys convert hydrogen ions into inert gases that are exhaled.
I: The kidneys store hydrogen ions for future use.
J: The kidneys absorb all hydrogen ions, preventing them from affecting the body's pH balance.

Okay, so I have this question about how the kidneys regulate hydrogen ion concentration in the body. Hmm, I remember that the human body, especially the cells, can only function properly within a narrow pH range. So the body must have mechanisms to keep the pH balanced. 

I think the main systems involved in acid-base balance are the respiratory system, the buffer systems, and the kidneys. The respiratory system helps by exhaling CO2, which is an acid in solution. Buffers like bicarbonate and phosphate help neutralize acids and bases quickly. But the kidneys play a more long-term role, I believe.

Wait, what do the kidneys do exactly? I remember they excrete excess hydrogen ions. So when the blood is too acidic, the kidneys can excrete more H+ ions in the urine. Also, they can reabsorb bicarbonate to help maintain the buffer system. 

Looking at the options now. Option A says the kidneys filter out H+ and recycle them. That doesn't sound right because recycling H+ doesn't make sense for pH balance. Option B says kidneys regulate H+ by excreting acidic or basic constituents. That fits because if there's excess acid, they excrete more acidic urine; if too alkaline, maybe excrete more bases or retain acids.

Option C says kidneys maintain constant production of H+ regardless of needs. No, the kidneys adjust based on the body's needs. Option D suggests producing H+ to maintain balance, but that's more of what the stomach does maybe. Option E says eliminate all H+ ions, which can't be right because we need some for digestion, etc.

Option F talks about detecting and signaling other organs. I think the kidneys respond to pH changes, maybe through hormones like aldosterone, but not sure if they signal others. Option G mentions enzymes neutralizing H+; that's more like what buffers do in the blood, not the kidneys. Option H says converting H+ to inert gases, which doesn't make sense. Option I is storing H+, which would be bad because excess H+ is harmful. Option J says absorbing all H+ to prevent affecting pH, but that's not possible because they need to excrete excess.

So the correct answer should be option B. The kidneys regulate H+ by excreting when levels deviate.

The kidneys play a crucial role in maintaining acid-base balance by regulating hydrogen ion (H⁺) concentration in the body. They achieve this by excreting excess H⁺ ions in the urine when the blood becomes too acidic and by reabsorbing bicarbonate to help maintain the buffer system. This ensures that the extracellular fluids remain within a narrow pH range, essential for proper cellular function.

Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**B: The kidneys regulate the hydrogen ion concentration of the extracellular fluids by excreting either acidic or basic constituents when the levels deviate from normal.**

Answer: B
