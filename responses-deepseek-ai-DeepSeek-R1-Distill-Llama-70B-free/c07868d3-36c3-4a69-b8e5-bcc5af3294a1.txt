Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let's read it again.

The question says: Suppose a convex 3D object has k pentagonal faces and m hexagonal faces. All faces are regular. What is k? The options are from A to J.

Hmm, wait, I remember that convex 3D objects with regular faces are probably Platonic solids, but the question doesn't specify that all faces must be the same. Oh wait, no, the question says all faces are regular, which means each face is a regular polygon, but different faces can be different polygons. So maybe it's an Archimedean solid.

Right, Archimedean solids are convex and have regular polygons for faces, but they can have more than one type. So I think the object in question is an Archimedean solid.

Now, I need to remember which Archimedean solids have pentagons and hexagons. I think the truncated icosahedron is one of them. Let me think. The truncated icosahedron has pentagons and hexagons. Oh wait, wait, the standard soccer ball pattern is a truncated icosahedron. So that's probably the one.

Wait, another thought: What about the icosidodecahedron? No, I think that one has triangles and pentagons. So back to the truncated icosahedron.

So the truncated icosahedron is formed by truncating (cutting off) the corners of an icosahedron. Each original vertex becomes a new face, and each original face is modified. The original icosahedron has 20 triangular faces, but after truncation, each triangle becomes a hexagon, and each vertex becomes a pentagon.

Wait, wait, let me get the numbers right. Let me try to recall the properties.

Icosahedron: 12 vertices, 30 edges, 20 triangular faces.

When you truncate it to form a truncated icosahedron, each original vertex is replaced by a new face, which is a pentagon. Each original triangular face becomes a hexagon.

So, number of pentagons would be equal to the number of original vertices, which is 12. And number of hexagons comes from the original faces, but how many?

Wait, the original icosahedron had 20 triangular faces, but truncation modifies each into a hexagon. So the number of hexagons is 20.

Wait, but wait, the truncated icosahedron has 12 pentagonal faces and 20 hexagonal faces. So in this case, k would be 12, right?

But wait, let me double-check. Another way to approach this is using Euler's formula.

Euler's formula: V - E + F = 2.

For an Archimedean solid, each face is regular, and the same arrangement of polygons surrounds each vertex.

So let's try applying Euler's formula to the truncated icosahedron.

Number of faces: F = k + m = 12 + 20 = 32.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the truncated icosahedron, each original vertex (12 of them) becomes a pentagonal face. Each original face (20 triangles) becomes a hexagonal face. So F = 12 + 20 = 32. Is that right?

Wait, but each original edge is also modified. The original icosahedron has 30 edges. Each edge is truncated at both ends, so each original edge becomes a new edge in the middle, and the truncation adds new edges around the new faces.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate vertices, edges, and faces for the truncated icosahedron.

Each pentagonal face has 5 edges, but each edge is shared by two faces. Similarly, each hexagonal face has 6 edges, each shared by two.

So total edges E = (5*k + 6*m)/2.

But wait, in the truncated icosahedron, k=12 pentagons and m=20 hexagons. So E = (5*12 + 6*20)/2 = (60 + 120)/2 = 180/2 = 90 edges.

Now, each pentagon has 5 vertices, but each vertex is shared by multiple faces. Let's think about the vertices. Each vertex is where a certain number of faces meet.

In Archimedean solids, each vertex is identical, and the arrangement of faces around each vertex is the same. For the truncated icosahedron, each vertex is surrounded by two hexagons and one pentagon. So the vertex configuration is 5.6.6.

Wait, no, actually, maybe it's 6.5.6. Let me think. The way the faces meet at each vertex is a hexagon, a pentagon, and another hexagon. So it's 6.5.6.

Wait, no, perhaps it's 5.6.6, but I might be getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps each vertex is part of a pentagon and two hexagons.

In any case, each vertex is where three faces meet: two hexagons and one pentagon.

So each pentagonal face has 5 vertices, each shared among three faces (since each vertex belongs to three faces). So total vertices V = (5*k)/(number of faces meeting at each vertex).

Wait, each vertex is shared by three faces, so for the pentagons, each contributes 5 vertices, but each is counted three times. So V_pent = (5*k)/3.

Similarly, each hexagon contributes 6 vertices, each counted three times, so V_hex = (6*m)/3 = 2*m.

Wait, but that might not be the correct approach. Alternatively, let's consider that each vertex is where a pentagon and two hexagons meet. So each vertex is part of one pentagon and two hexagons.

So the number of vertices can also be calculated as (number of pentagons * 5) / 1 (since each pentagon contributes 5 vertices, and each vertex is part of exactly one pentagon). Because each vertex is part of one pentagon.

Wait, that's a good point. Because each vertex is part of one pentagon and two hexagons. So the total number of vertices V = (k * 5) / 1 = 5k.

Alternatively, since each vertex is part of two hexagons, the total number can also be calculated as (m * 6 * 2)/3? Hmm, maybe not. Let's think again.

Let me approach this with the known values. For the truncated icosahedron, I'm pretty sure that k=12 (pentagons) and m=20 (hexagons). So F=32.

Now, using Euler's formula: V - E + F = 2.

We have F=32.

We can compute E as (5k +6m)/2 = (60 + 120)/2 = 90.

So E=90.

Then, Euler's formula: V - 90 + 32 = 2 â†’ V = 60.

So V=60.

Now, each vertex is where two hexagons and one pentagon meet, so the number of faces meeting at each vertex is 3.

Total number of face corners: each pentagon has 5 corners, each hexagon 6. So total corners = 5k +6m =5*12 +6*20=60+120=180.

But each actual vertex is shared by 3 faces, so number of vertices V= 180 /3 =60, which matches our earlier calculation.

So that's consistent.

So in this case, k=12, which is option D.

Wait but the question is presented as a general case: a convex 3D object with k pentagons and m hexagons, all faces regular. So is it possible that the answer is 12, which is option D.

Wait, but I thought the soccer ball is a truncated icosahedron, which has 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons. So the answer should be D:12.

Wait, but let me think if there's another Archimedean solid with pentagons and hexagons. Let me recall the list.

The Archimedean solids are:

1. Truncated tetrahedron: triangles and hexagons.
2. Cuboctahedron: triangles and squares.
3. Truncated octahedron: squares and hexagons.
4. Truncated cube: squares and octagons.
5. Rhombicuboctahedron: triangles, squares.
6. Truncated cuboctahedron (Great truncated cuboctahedron): squares, hexagons, octagons.
Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing some up. Let me think again.

Wait, the truncated icosahedron is the one with pentagons and hexagons. So yes, that's the one.

So the only Archimedean solid with regular pentagons and hexagons is the truncated icosahedron, which has 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons.

So the answer is k=12, which is option D.
</think>

The question involves determining the number of pentagonal faces, \( k \), on a convex 3D object with regular pentagonal and hexagonal faces. This object is identified as an Archimedean solid, specifically the truncated icosahedron. 

The truncated icosahedron is formed by truncating the vertices of an icosahedron, resulting in two types of faces: pentagons and hexagons. Each original vertex of the icosahedron becomes a pentagonal face, and each original triangular face becomes a hexagonal face. The icosahedron has 12 vertices and 20 triangular faces, so the truncated icosahedron has 12 pentagonal faces and 20 hexagonal faces.

To confirm, Euler's formula \( V - E + F = 2 \) is applied. The truncated icosahedron has:

- \( F = k + m = 12 + 20 = 32 \),
- \( E = \frac{5k + 6m}{2} = \frac{5(12) + 6(20)}{2} = 90 \),
- \( V = \frac{5k}{1} = 60 \) (since each vertex is part of one pentagon).

Substituting into Euler's formula: \( 60 - 90 + 32 = 2 \), which is consistent. Thus, the number of pentagonal faces \( k \) is 12.

The correct answer is **D: 12**.
