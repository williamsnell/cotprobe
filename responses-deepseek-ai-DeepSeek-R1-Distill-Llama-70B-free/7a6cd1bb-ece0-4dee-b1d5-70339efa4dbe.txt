Okay, so I'm trying to solve this double-slit experiment problem. Hmm, I remember that the double-slit experiment has something to do with interference patterns. The question is about finding the spacing between adjacent bright lines when yellow light is used.

The given values are D = 0.1 mm and L = 1 m. Wait, D is the slit separation, right? Or wait, no, D is the distance between the slits. Oh, wait, I think D is the distance between the two slits, and L is the distance from the slits to the screen. So, yeah, D is 0.1 mm and L is 1 m.

Yellow light... I need to know its wavelength. I think the wavelength of yellow light is around 589 nanometers. Wait, is it 589 or 580-something? Oh right, sodium light is about 589 nm. I'll go with that.

The formula for the bright fringe spacing in a double-slit experiment is given by the equation Δy = (λ * L) / D. Oh wait, but wait, isn't that for the distance between adjacent maxima? Yes, that's right. Because each bright fringe is separated by this amount.

So I need to plug in the values. Let me make sure of the units. D is 0.1 mm, which is 0.0001 meters. Because 1 mm is 1e-3 m, so 0.1 mm is 1e-4 m. L is 1 m, which is straightforward. The wavelength λ is 589 nm, which is 589e-9 meters.

Putting them into the formula: Δy = (589e-9 m * 1 m) / (0.0001 m). Let me compute that step by step.

First, 589e-9 multiplied by 1 is 589e-9. Then, divide by 0.0001, which is the same as multiplying by 10000. So 589e-9 * 1e4 = 589e-5. Because 1e-9 * 1e4 is 1e-5.

589e-5 meters is 5.89e-3 meters. Because 589 * 1e-5 is 0.00589 meters. Wait, 0.00589 meters is 5.89 mm. Oh wait, wait, wait. 1e-3 meters is 1 mm, so 0.00589 meters is 5.89 mm?

Wait, no. Wait, 1 meter is 1000 mm. So 0.00589 meters is 5.89 mm? Because 0.005 meters is 5 mm. So 0.00589 m is 5.89 mm. But let me check the calculation again.

Wait, let me compute it numerically. 589e-9 divided by 0.0001 is (589 * 1e-9) / 1e-4) = 589 * 1e-5. Because 1e-9 divided by 1e-4 is 1e-5. So 589 * 1e-5 is 0.00589 meters, which is 5.89 mm. So the spacing is approximately 5.89 mm.

Looking at the options, the closest one is option A: 3 mm, no. Option E is 4.5, option I is 6. Wait, none of the options exactly match 5.89. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I swapped D and something else. Let me double-check the formula. The formula is Δy = (λ L) / d, where d is the slit separation. Oh wait, maybe I confused D as d. Oh wait, in the problem, D is given as 0.1 mm. So in the formula, d is 0.1 mm, which is 1e-4 m.

Wait, let me redo the calculation. So λ is 589e-9 m, L is 1 m, d is 0.0001 m.

Δy = (589e-9 * 1) / (0.0001) = 589e-9 / 1e-4 = 589e-5 = 0.00589 m =5.89 mm.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the wavelength. Wait, sodium light is about 589 nm, but maybe the question considers yellow light as a different wavelength. Let me think. Yellow light's wavelength is approximately 570-590 nm. Maybe the problem uses 600 nm for simplicity? No, that's more towards orange. Or perhaps it's using 580 nm?

Wait, perhaps the exact value isn't necessary because the options might be approximate. Let me check my options again. The options are:

A: 3 mm

B:9 mm

C:1.5 mm

D:12 mm

E:4.5 mm

F:15 mm

G:7.5 mm

H:10 mm

I:6 mm

J:18 mm.

Hmm, none of these is 5.89. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I confused D and L. Let me check the problem statement again. Oh, D is 0.1 mm, and L is 1 m. So D is the slit separation, correct. So I used D as d in the formula. So that's correct.

Wait another thing: When I multiplied 589e-9 by 1, that's correct. Then divided by 0.0001 m. 589e-9 / 0.0001 is 589e-6 meters? Wait, no, 0.0001 is 1e-4. So 589e-9 / 1e-4 is 589e-5, which is 5.89e-3 m, which is 5.89 mm.

Wait, perhaps the options are in centimeters? No, the options are in mm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have converted D into meters correctly. D is 0.1 mm, which is 0.1 * 1e-3 m = 1e-4 m. So that's correct.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute the exact value.

Compute 589 nm * 1 m / 0.1 mm.

Wait, 589 nm is 589e-9 m. 0.1 mm is 0.1e-3 m.

So:

(589e-9 m * 1 m) / (0.1e-3 m) = (589e-9) / (0.1e-3) ) meters.

Calculating denominator: 0.1e-3 = 1e-4.

So 589e-9 / 1e-4 = 589e-5 = 5.89e-3 meters = 5.89 mm.

Hmm, but the options don't have 5.89 mm. The closest is option I:6 mm. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the wavelength. Maybe the problem uses a different value for yellow light.

Wait, perhaps the intended wavelength is 600 nm. Let me try that.

600e-9 m *1 m / (0.1e-3 m) = (600e-9) / (1e-4) ) = 600e-5 = 0.006 m =6 mm. Oh, that's option I.

But wait, why would the problem use 600 nm for yellow? Because sodium is 589, but perhaps for simplicity, they rounded it to 600 nm.

Alternatively, maybe the question expects me to use 580 nm. Let me compute with 580 nm.

580e-9 *1 / 0.0001 = 580e-5 = 0.0058 m =5.8 mm. Still not matching any option exactly.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is done in millimeters from the start. Let's try that approach.

D = 0.1 mm, which is 0.1 mm. L is 1 m = 1000 mm.

λ = 589 nm = 589e-6 mm.

Wait, 1 nm is 1e-6 mm. Because 1 mm is 1e3 mm. Wait, no, 1 m is 1e3 mm, so 1 nm is 1e-9 m, which is 1e-6 mm.

So λ =589e-6 mm.

So plug into Δy = (λ L) / D.

So λ =589e-6 mm, L=1000 mm, D=0.1 mm.

So (589e-6 * 1000) / 0.1 = (589e-3) / 0.1.

Wait, 589e-6 *1e3 = 589e-3 mm.

Divide by 0.1: 589e-3 /0.1 = 589e-2 = 5.89 mm.

Same result as before.

So perhaps the intended answer is 6 mm (option I), assuming a rounded wavelength of 600 nm. Or maybe I miscalculated somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Δy = (2λ L)/D. No, no, the formula for double-slit is Δy = (λ L)/d, where d is the slit separation.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe I mixed up the formula for double-slit versus single-slit. No, single-slit has a different formula, and this is double-slit. So I think the formula is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses D as the distance to the screen, but no, the problem states D is 0.1 mm. No, the problem says D=0.1 mm and L=1 m. So D is the slit separation, L is the distance to the screen.

Hmm, so why the options don't have 5.89 mm? Maybe I made a miscalculation in unit conversion.

Wait, 589 nm is 589e-9 m. Let me write it in meters: 589e-9 m.

Then, (589e-9 m * 1 m) = 589e-9 m².

Divide by D=0.1e-3 m: 589e-9 / 0.1e-3 = 589e-6 / 1e-3? No, wait 0.1e-3 is 1e-4. So 589e-9 /1e-4 =589e-5, which is 5.89e-3 m, which is 5.89 mm.

But let me think, perhaps the problem expects the answer in cm? No, options are all in mm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the exponent when converting. Let me recompute.

Calculate 589e-9 *1 / 0.0001.

0.0001 is 1e-4.

So 589e-9 / 1e-4 = 589 * (1e-9 / 1e-4) )= 589 * 1e-5 = 5.89e-3 m=5.89 mm.

Hmm. So I'm confident that the calculation leads to approximately 5.89 mm. But the options don't have this value. The options are A:3, B:9, C:1.5, D:12, E:4.5, F:15, G:7.5, H:10, I:6, J:18.

So the closest is I:6 mm, but that's 0.11 mm off. Alternatively, maybe I messed up the wavelength. Let me check: what's the actual wavelength of yellow light? Well, yellow is about 570-590 nm. So maybe the problem uses 590 nm.

Compute with 590 nm: 590e-9 m.

(590e-9 *1) / 0.0001 = 590e-5 = 0.0059 m=5.9 mm. Still not matching.

Alternatively, maybe I should use 600 nm as an approximation, leading to 6 mm.

But why would the options not include 5.89 mm? Unless perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: the formula Δy = (λ L)/d is the distance between the central maximum and the first bright fringe, right? Or is it between adjacent fringes. No, no, the formula gives the spacing between adjacent maxima, so that's correct.

Another possibility: I might have the formula wrong. Wait, double-slit formula is y = (m λ L)/d, where m is the order. So the spacing between m and m+1 would be Δy = λ L/d. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the units for D are in meters. No, the problem says D is 0.1 mm, which I converted correctly to 0.0001 m.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used D=0.1 cm? But no, the problem states 0.1 mm.

Wait, maybe I should compute with all values in millimeters. Let me try that.

λ =589 nm = 0.589 micrometers = 0.000589 mm.

D =0.1 mm.

L=1 meter =1000 mm.

So, Δy = (0.000589 mm * 1000 mm) / 0.1 mm.

Multiply: 0.000589 * 1000 = 0.589 mm.

Divide by 0.1 mm: 0.589 /0.1 =5.89 mm.

Same result.

So I'm stuck again. Since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is 6 mm, option I.

But why? Maybe the problem uses 600 nm as the wavelength for yellow light.

Let me try that. 600 nm is 0.6 micrometers.

So, 0.6e-6 m =600e-9 m.

Δy = (600e-9 *1)/(1e-4) = 600e-5 =0.006 m=6 mm. Yes, this gives 6 mm, which is option I.

So perhaps the question assumes yellow light is 600 nm. That would make sense, as it's a nice round number.

So the correct answer would be option I:6 mm.

To solve the problem, we use the formula for the spacing between adjacent bright fringes in a double-slit experiment:

\[
\Delta y = \frac{\lambda L}{D}
\]

Where:
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of the light,
- \( L \) is the distance from the slits to the screen,
- \( D \) is the separation between the slits.

### Given Values:
- \( \lambda = 589 \, \text{nm} = 589 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \) (wavelength of yellow light),
- \( L = 1 \, \text{m} \),
- \( D = 0.1 \, \text{mm} = 0.1 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m} = 10^{-4} \, \text{m} \).

### Calculation:
Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
\Delta y = \frac{(589 \times 10^{-9}) \cdot 1}{10^{-4}}
\]

Simplify:

\[
\Delta y = 589 \times 10^{-5} = 0.00589 \, \text{m} = 5.89 \, \text{mm}.
\]

### Comparison with Options:
The calculated value of \( \Delta y = 5.89 \, \text{mm} \) does not exactly match any of the given options. However, the closest option is **6 mm** (option I). This discrepancy likely arises because the problem assumes a rounded wavelength for yellow light, such as \( \lambda = 600 \, \text{nm} \), which simplifies the calculation:

\[
\Delta y = \frac{(600 \times 10^{-9}) \cdot 1}{10^{-4}} = 6 \, \text{mm}.
\]

Thus, the most reasonable answer is **6 mm**.
