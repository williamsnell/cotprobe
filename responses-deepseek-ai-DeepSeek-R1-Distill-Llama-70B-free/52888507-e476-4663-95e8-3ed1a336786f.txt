Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Is it not unity alone that can weld us into an effective force, capable of creating our own progress and making our valuable contribution to world peace? Which independent African state will claim that its financial structure and banking institutions are fully harnessed to its national development? Which will claim that its material resources and human energies are available for its own national aspirations? We are fast learning that political independence is not enough to rid us of the consequences of colonial rule. We have been too busy nursing our separate states to understand fully the basic need for union, rooted in common purpose, common planning and common endeavour.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about Kwame Nkrumah's speech. Let me start by reading the passage carefully. 

In the passage, Nkrumah is talking about African unity. He says that unity is necessary for African countries to become an effective force, to create their own progress, and contribute to world peace. He asks which African state can say its financial structures and banking institutions are fully harnessed for national development. He also questions whether material resources and human energies are available for national aspirations. He mentions that political independence isn't enough to rid them of colonial rule's consequences and that they've been too busy with their separate states to understand the need for union based on common purpose, planning, and endeavor.

So the question is asking which factor was most important in preventing the fulfillment of these political dreams. The options are A through D.

Looking at the options:

A: Lack of common ethnicity, language, or religion.
B: Spread of communism.
C: Armed intervention by Cold War superpowers.
D: Africa's shortage of natural resources.

The passage emphasizes the need for unity and suggests that political independence alone isn't enough. The main issue seems to be the lack of unity and cooperation among African states. Nkrumah is pushing for a union, implying that without it, progress is hindered.

So, why didn't African countries unite more? The options need to be considered in the context of what Nkrumah is highlighting.

Option A talks about a lack of common ethnicity, language, or religion. That makes sense because many African countries were colonially created with borders that didn't respect ethnic or linguistic boundaries. This diversity could make unity difficult. But does this directly prevent the fulfillment of the dreams Nkrumah outlined?

Option B is about the spread of communism. I'm not sure that's the main issue here. The passage doesn't mention communism, so maybe this isn't relevant.

Option C mentions armed intervention by Cold War superpowers. During the Cold War, superpowers did interfere in African affairs, supporting certain leaders or factions. This could have hindered unity as countries might have been aligned with different superpowers, creating divisions.

Option D is about a shortage of natural resources. But the passage actually suggests that resources are available but not being utilized properly for national development, so maybe the issue isn't a shortage but management.

Wait, the passage says, "Which will claim that its material resources and human energies are available for its own national aspirations?" So it's more about the resources being used for national goals, implying that they have resources but aren't using them effectively because of lack of unity or planning.

So the main issue is preventing the unity that Nkrumah is advocating. What factors prevented that unity?

Looking at the options again, A is about internal divisions due to ethnicity, etc. C is about external interference.

Nkrumah's speech was in 1963, a time when many African countries had just gained independence. The Cold War was in full swing. Superpowers like the US and USSR were involved in proxy wars and influencing governments. If African countries were being supported by different superpowers, this could create tensions and prevent them from uniting. For example, some might align with the West, others with the East, leading to divisions.

Alternatively, the lack of common ethnicity, language, etc., might make forming a union harder. But I'm not sure if that's the most significant factor in the context of the passage.

Wait, the passage says they were too busy nursing their separate states, which suggests that maintaining independence and separate national identities was the issue. So maybe the lack of commonalities (Option A) was a barrier. But I'm a bit torn between A and C.

In the context of the Cold War, though, the superpowers' interventions were a significant factor. For instance, the Congo Crisis in the early 60s involved both the US and the USSR. This kind of interference could prevent African unity because countries might be pulled in different directions by external powers.

So, considering that, I think Option C is more likely the answer because external interference from Cold War superpowers would directly prevent the formation of a unified African front that Nkrumah was advocating for. The passage doesn't explicitly mention this, but the question is about what prevented the fulfillment of the dreams, which might involve external factors beyond just internal divisions.

Wait, but the passage does focus on the internal aspect of separate states not uniting. It doesn't mention external superpowers. So maybe the answer is A because the lack of common factors made unity difficult. Or perhaps it's more about the newly independent states focusing on their own nations rather than uniting.

Hmm. The question is about the most important factor. I think the primary issue Nkrumah addresses is the lack of unity due to separate states, which might tie into internal divisions like ethnicity, etc. But another angle is that during the Cold War, external interference made it hard for African countries to unite because they were often in different camps.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is A because without a common identity, it's harder to form a union. But I'm not entirely sure. 

Wait, the passage doesn't mention ethnicity or language as barriers. It talks about financial structures and resource management. So maybe the main issue is more about the economic and political structures, not necessarily the social factors. 

But the options don't include economic structures as an option. The options are about ethnicity (A), communism (B), Cold War intervention (C), and resources (D). 

So, considering that, perhaps the main obstacle was the interference by Cold War superpowers. Because even if African countries wanted to unite, external powers might have worked against it, supporting certain governments or causing conflicts that made unity difficult.

I think I'm leaning towards C as the answer because Cold War dynamics played a significant role in African politics post-independence, often undermining efforts at unity.

The passage by Kwame Nkrumah emphasizes the need for African unity to overcome the challenges of political independence and achieve common goals. He highlights that political independence alone is insufficient to address the legacy of colonial rule and that African countries must move beyond their separate state-focused priorities to form a united front based on common purpose, planning, and endeavor. The question asks which factor was most important in preventing the fulfillment of these political dreams.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: A lack of common ethnicity, language, or religion could create divisions, as many African countries were colonially created with borders that disregarded ethnic and linguistic boundaries. However, the passage does not explicitly mention these factors as barriers to unity.
  
- **Option B**: The spread of communism is not relevant to the passage, as Nkrumah does not discuss communism or its impact on African unity.

- **Option C**: Armed intervention by Cold War superpowers is a plausible factor. During the Cold War, superpowers like the U.S. and the USSR often interfered in African affairs, supporting certain leaders or factions. This external interference could have hindered African unity by creating divisions and aligning countries with different superpowers.

- **Option D**: Africa's shortage of natural resources is not the issue, as the passage suggests that resources are available but not being effectively utilized for national development.

The passage focuses on the internal challenge of separate states failing to unite, but the broader historical context of the Cold War suggests that external interference was a significant obstacle to African unity. Therefore, the most important factor preventing the fulfillment of Nkrumah's political dreams was likely the armed intervention and influence of Cold War superpowers.
