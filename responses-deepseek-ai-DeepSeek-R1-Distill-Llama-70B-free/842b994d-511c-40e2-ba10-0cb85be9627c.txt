Okay, so I've got this question about reindeer herding and types of diffusion. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on my geography terms, but I'll try to break it down.

The question is asking about reindeer herding as an economic activity of the Sami in Norway. It's an example of which type of diffusion. The options are from A to H, so I need to figure out which one fits.

First, I should remember what the different types of diffusion are. There's contagious diffusion, which is when ideas or traits spread quickly to nearby areas because of their popularity or ease of transmission. Like how a disease spreads, or maybe a viral trend.

Then there's hierarchical diffusion. That's when ideas or innovations spread from a higher authority or influential place to the lower ones. For example, a new technology developed in a major city might spread outward to smaller towns. It goes through layers of hierarchy.

Sequential diffusion is a bit trickier. I think it's when something spreads in a step-by-step manner, maybe along a transportation route, like a river or a road. So it moves in a sequence from one point to the next along a path.

Stimulus diffusion is when an idea is adopted but then modified to fit the new culture. So, like taking an idea and making it your own, which might create a new trait.

Expansion diffusion is broad; it can be either relocation or hierarchical or something else. Wait, expansion diffusion might involve the spreading of a culture or trait from a central point outward. Like how a religion spreads from its origin.

Reverse hierarchical would be the opposite, maybe going from lower to higher, but I'm not too sure about that one.

Peripheral diffusion is when something spreads from a place to its periphery, like the edges. Maybe from a central area to the outer regions.

Now, the question is about reindeer herding among the Sami. So the Sami are an indigenous people in northern parts of countries like Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia. I know that reindeer herding is a traditional activity for them.

I think reindeer herding as a practice would have originated in certain areas and then spread to other Sami communities. Since the Sami people have their own distinct cultural and economic practices, the spread of herding would be within their own groups.

So considering diffusion types, I'm trying to see which applies. It's not contagious because it's not spreading rapidly or based on proximity in a contagious way. It's more of a cultural practice passed along.

Is it hierarchical? Well, if the idea came from a central authority and spread to other areas, but I don't think the Sami have a central hierarchy in that sense. They might have had leaders, but perhaps the practice spread through their own social networks.

Wait, maybe it's sequential. If the herding spread along a migration route or along trade paths, then it could be sequential. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe it's expansion diffusion. If the Sami people moved into new areas and brought their herding practices with them, that might be expansion.

Wait, expansion diffusion can be either relocation or hierarchical. Relocation would mean people moving and taking the practice with them. So if the Sami migrated and brought reindeer herding to new places, that's relocation diffusion.

So then, the type would be expansion diffusion, which is option G.

Alternatively, another thought: contagious diffusion is when an idea spreads because of its adaptability. If herding was adopted by neighboring groups because it's a good way to survive in the Arctic, maybe it's contagious. But I'm not sure. Contagious diffusion is more about the rapid spread through proximity, like a fad.

Wait, the Sami herding is a traditional practice. So it's more likely that it spread through their migration or relocation, which would be expansion diffusion via relocation.

So the answer should be G: Expansion.

Reindeer herding as an economic activity of the Sami in Norway is an example of expansion diffusion. This type of diffusion occurs when a cultural or economic practice spreads as people migrate or relocate to new areas, bringing their traditions with them. The Sami, an indigenous group in northern regions, likely spread reindeer herding as they moved into new territories, making it a case of expansion diffusion through relocation.

Answer: G
