Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about community mental health prevention types. Hmm, I remember that prevention is usually categorized into primary, secondary, and tertiary. Wait, let me think about each of them.

Primary prevention is about stopping the problem before it occurs. Like, preventing mental health issues from arising in the first place. So that's things like education, promoting mental health, maybe community programs to build resilience. So that's probably options C, E, H. Like, E says "deal with problems before they occur" which sounds like primary.

Secondary prevention is about early intervention. So once a problem has started, but it's not too severe yet. The goal is to catch it early and prevent it from getting worse. So maybe things like screening, early treatment, support systems. So looking at the options, option G says "reduce the severity of problems" which fits because secondary aims to lessen the impact. Also, option B is about creating a support system, which could be part of it.

Tertiary prevention deals with severe, established problems. It's about managing and treating them to prevent further deterioration or reduce the impact. So that would be things like providing treatment for severe issues, which is option I.

The question is about secondary prevention. So the options are B, G, etc. Let me read the options again.

Option A: Increase access to services. That sounds more like a general approach, maybe part of primary or tertiary.

Option B: Create support systems. That could be secondary because it's helping people once they have issues, but not sure.

Option C: Educate the community. That's primary.

Option D: Prevent community disintegration. Not sure what that means, maybe primary.

Option E: Deal with problems before they occur. That's definitely primary.

Option F: Eliminate problems completely. That's primary again.

Option G: Reduce severity. That fits secondary.

Option H: Promote awareness. Primary.

Option I: Provide severe treatment. Tertiary.

So the question is, what does secondary prevention attempt to do? The options are B, G, and maybe others.

Wait, the question says secondary prevention "attempts to". So I think the main goal is to catch problems early to prevent them from becoming more serious. So reducing the severity or providing early intervention.

Looking at the options, G is "reduce the severity of problems" which aligns with secondary prevention. So I think the answer is G.

Another angle, sometimes secondary prevention is about early detection and treatment. So G fits that because it's about lessening the severity once the problem is detected early.

Secondary prevention in community mental health focuses on early intervention to prevent mental health issues from worsening. It aims to reduce the severity of problems once they have begun, rather than preventing them entirely (which is primary prevention) or managing severe, established issues (tertiary prevention). Among the options provided, "reduce the severity of problems" aligns most closely with this definition.

Answer: G
