Okay, so I've got this problem here about gold and neutrons. Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on. So, the reaction is Au^197 plus a neutron becomes Au^198 and something else, but I think the specifics of what that other particle is might not matter here. The key point is that when a neutron hits Au^197, it becomes Au^198.

The problem says that 10^6 neutrons are absorbed per second. So, every second, a million neutrons are being used to produce Au^198. But wait, not all the Au^197 might be converting, but maybe I can assume that each neutron absorbed leads to one Au^198 atom. So, the rate of production of Au^198 is 1e6 atoms per second. Let me note that down: production rate R = 1e6 / s.

Now, Au^198 is radioactive and emits beta particles. Its half-life is 2.70 days. The question is asking how many atoms of Au^198 are present after 2 days of continuous irradiation. So, two days of producing Au^198, which then decays.

This feels like a problem involving both the production of a radioactive substance and its simultaneous decay. I remember something called the Bateman equation, which deals with the number of atoms present when there's a steady production and decay. Oh right, the formula for the number of atoms N at a given time when there's continuous production and decay is:

N = (R / λ) * (1 - e^(-λt))

Where R is the production rate, λ is the decay constant, and t is the time.

Wait, wait. I think I got that right. Because when you start with zero, the number increases until the rate of decay matches the rate of production. But in this case, we're not at equilibrium yet, so the exponential term comes into play.

So first, I need to find the decay constant λ. The half-life formula is T1/2 = ln(2) / λ. So λ = ln(2) / T1/2. The half-life here is 2.70 days, and the time given is 2 days.

Let me calculate λ. λ = 0.6931 / 2.70 ≈ let's see. 0.6931 / 2.70. Hmm, 2.70 is about 3, so 0.6931/3 is approximately 0.231. But 2.70 is a bit less than 3, so 0.6931/2.7 would be a bit higher than 0.231. Let me compute it accurately: 0.6931 divided by 2.7 equals approximately 0.2568 per day.

Wait, but the production rate R is given per second. Oh right, I should convert the decay constant into per second as well. Because R is 1e6 per second, so time units must match.

So what's the time t? It's 2 days. So I need to convert t into seconds to match the units of R. Let me see: 1 day is 86400 seconds. So 2 days is 2 * 86400 = 172800 seconds.

But wait, the decay constant λ is per day. So I need to convert λ from per day to per second. So λ = 0.2568 per day. So per second, that's 0.2568 / 86400 ≈ let's calculate that.

0.2568 divided by 86400. Let me think: 86400 is 8.64e4. So 0.2568 / 8.64e4 = approximately 2.973e-6 per second.

Wait, let me do that more accurately. 0.2568 / 86400 = (approximately) 0.2568 / 8.64e4 = 2.97e-6 s^-1.

So now, λ is approximately 2.97e-6 per second, and t is 172800 seconds.

Now, plug into the formula N = (R / λ) * (1 - e^(-λt)).

R is 1e6 atoms per second. So R/λ is (1e6) / (2.97e-6) = 1e6 / 2.97e-6.

Let me calculate that. 1e6 divided by 3e-6 is 1e12 / 3 ≈ 3.33e11. But since it's 2.97e-6, it's a bit less than 3e-6, so the result is about 3.37e11.

Wait, let me compute it accurately. 1e6 / 2.97e-6 = (1e6) / (2.97e-6) = (1 / 2.97e-6) * 1e6 = (1 / 2.97) * 1e12.

1/2.97 is approximately 0.3367. So 0.3367 * 1e12 = 3.367e11.

So R/λ is about 3.367e11.

Now, the term (1 - e^(-λt)).

λt is (2.97e-6 s^-1) * (172800 s) = 2.97e-6 * 1.728e5 = Let's compute that.

2.97e-6 * 1.728e5 = (2.97 * 1.728) * 1e-6+5 = 5.14 * 1e-1 = approximately 0.514.

So λt ≈ 0.514.

So e^(-0.514) is about... Let me think. e^0.5 is about 1.6487, so e^0.514 is a bit more. Let's compute it more accurately.

Wait, 0.514 is the exponent. So e^-0.514 = 1 / e^0.514.

e^0.5 is approximately 1.6487, and e^0.014 is about 1.0141. So e^0.514 ≈ 1.6487 * 1.0141 ≈ 1.670.

So 1 / 1.670 ≈ 0.5988.

So 1 - e^(-0.514) ≈ 1 - 0.5988 = 0.4012.

So putting it all together: N = (3.367e11) * (0.4012) ≈ 3.367e11 * 0.4012.

Let me compute that. 3e11 * 0.4 is 1.2e11. 0.367e11 * 0.4 is 0.1468e11. And then the 3.367e11 * 0.0012 is something, but maybe a better way is to compute 3.367e11 * 0.4012.

Alternatively, 3.367e11 * 0.4 = 1.3468e11, and 3.367e11 * 0.0012 is about 4.04e8. So adding them gives approximately 1.3468e11 + 0.0404e11 = 1.3872e11.

Wait, perhaps I should do it more accurately:

0.4012 = 0.4 + 0.0012.

3.367e11 * 0.4 = 1.3468e11.

3.367e11 * 0.0012 = 0.0040404e11.

Adding them gives 1.35084e11.

So N ≈ 1.3508e11 atoms.

Looking at the options, option G is 1.35e11, which matches.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, earlier I computed λ as 0.2568 per day, correct? Then converted to per second, which is 0.2568 / 86400 ≈ 2.97e-6 s^-1. Then, R is 1e6 per second. R/λ is 1e6 / 2.97e-6 ≈ 3.367e11, correct.

λt is 2.97e-6 * 172800 s. 172800 is 2 days in seconds. So 2.97e-6 * 1.728e5 = (2.97 * 1.728) * (1e-6 * 1e5) = (5.14) * (1e-1) = 0.514. So e^(-0.514)= approx 0.5988, so 1 - 0.5988 is 0.4012.

So N=3.367e11 * 0.4012 = 1.3508e11, which is about 1.35e11. So option G: 1.35 x 10^11 atoms.

To determine the number of Au^198 atoms present after 2 days of continuous irradiation, we use the formula for the number of atoms in a system with continuous production and decay:

\[
N = \frac{R}{\lambda} \cdot \left(1 - e^{-\lambda t}\right)
\]

### Step 1: Define the parameters
- **Production rate**: \( R = 10^6 \, \text{atoms/s} \)
- **Half-life of Au^198**: \( T_{1/2} = 2.70 \, \text{days} \)
- **Time of irradiation**: \( t = 2 \, \text{days} \)

### Step 2: Calculate the decay constant (\( \lambda \))
The decay constant is related to the half-life by:

\[
\lambda = \frac{\ln(2)}{T_{1/2}}
\]

Substituting \( T_{1/2} = 2.70 \, \text{days} \):

\[
\lambda = \frac{0.693}{2.70} \approx 0.2568 \, \text{day}^{-1}
\]

Convert \( \lambda \) to per second:

\[
\lambda = \frac{0.2568}{86400} \approx 2.97 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{s}^{-1}
\]

### Step 3: Convert time to seconds
\[
t = 2 \, \text{days} \cdot 86400 \, \text{s/day} = 172800 \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( \lambda t \)
\[
\lambda t = (2.97 \times 10^{-6}) \cdot 172800 \approx 0.514
\]

### Step 5: Calculate \( 1 - e^{-\lambda t} \)
Using \( \lambda t \approx 0.514 \):

\[
e^{-0.514} \approx 0.5988 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 1 - e^{-0.514} \approx 0.4012
\]

### Step 6: Calculate \( \frac{R}{\lambda} \)
\[
\frac{R}{\lambda} = \frac{10^6}{2.97 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 3.367 \times 10^{11}
\]

### Step 7: Calculate \( N \)
\[
N = \left(3.367 \times 10^{11}\right) \cdot 0.4012 \approx 1.35 \times 10^{11}
\]

### Final Answer
The number of Au^198 atoms present after 2 days is approximately \( 1.35 \times 10^{11} \), which corresponds to **option G**.
