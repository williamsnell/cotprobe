Question:

If consumers are advised that multigrained bread will substantially lessen the risk of cancer, which of the following will happen in the market for multigrained bread?

Options:

A: The supply curve will shift to the right, decreasing the price of multigrained bread.
B: The demand curve will shift to the left, decreasing the price of multigrained bread.
C: The demand and supply curves will both shift to the left, keeping the price of multigrained bread stable.
D: The demand and supply curves will both shift to the right, keeping the price of multigrained bread stable.
E: The supply curve will shift to the left, decreasing the price of multigrained bread.
F: The demand curve will shift to the right, increasing the price of multigrained bread.
G: The supply curve will shift to the left, increasing the price of multigrained bread.
H: The supply curve will shift to the right, increasing the price of multigrained bread.
I: The demand and supply curves will not be affected, keeping the price of multigrained bread stable.
J: The demand curve will shift to the left, increasing the price of multigrained bread.

Okay, so I have this economics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about what happens in the market for multigrained bread if consumers are told it can substantially reduce cancer risk. The options are A through J, each describing a different shift in supply and demand curves and the resulting price.

Hmm, I remember that demand and supply curves shift based on various factors. When something happens that makes a product more desirable, the demand usually increases. So, if multigrained bread is now seen as healthier, more people would want to buy it. That should shift the demand curve to the right, right? Because at every price level, more people are willing to buy the bread.

But wait, does anything happen to the supply? Well, supply is based on production costs, technology, prices of inputs, etc. The information about health benefits doesn't directly affect the producers' costs or the ease of production. So I don't think supply would shift unless there's a change in production costs or something else. But the question doesn't mention anything about production becoming easier or more expensive. So supply probably stays the same.

So if only demand shifts to the right, what happens? In a market, when demand increases and supply remains the same, the price tends to go up. Because more people want the product, so sellers can charge higher prices. So the price of multigrained bread would increase.

Looking at the options, option F says the demand curve shifts right, increasing the price. That makes sense. Other options either involve the supply shifting, which I don't think is the case here. For example, option A says supply shifts right and price decreases, but that's not what we expect here. Option B is demand shifting left, which would be the opposite of what's happening. Option E and G involve supply shifts left, which again, not applicable.

Wait, did I miss any other possibilities? Let me think. If the health advice causes more demand, but maybe bakeries decide to increase production, which could shift supply right. But wait, the initial change is in consumer perception, not in production costs or availability of resources for suppliers. So unless the increased demand causes suppliers to produce more, but the supply curve is about the quantity supplied at each price. So, in the short term, without a change in input prices or tech, supply doesn't shift. So supply remains the same, demand shifts right, price goes up.

So the correct answer should be F: demand shifts right, price increases.

The correct answer is F. When consumers are advised that multigrained bread can reduce cancer risk, the perceived benefit increases, leading to higher demand. This shifts the demand curve to the right. Since there's no indication that production costs or other supply factors change, the supply curve remains unchanged. As a result, the increased demand leads to a higher price for multigrained bread.

Answer: F
