Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about impeachment in the U.S. government. I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me think through what I remember about impeachment.

The question is asking which statement is NOT true about impeachment. The options are A to D, and the answer choices include things about grounds for impeachment, the votes required in the House and Senate, etc.

First, I remember that impeachment is a way to remove federal officials, including the President, Vice-President, and civil officers. The process starts in the House of Representatives. The House has the sole power to impeach, which means they bring the charges. Then, the Senate holds a trial to decide whether to convict and remove the person from office.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Grounds include high crimes and misdemeanors. I think that's correct. The Constitution says impeachment is for "high crimes and misdemeanors," which are pretty broad terms. So A is true.

Option B: A majority vote in the House is necessary to invoke charges. Wait, I believe the House votes on articles of impeachment. If a majority votes in favor, then the person is impeached. So B sounds correct too. Because it's a majority, not supermajority. So B is true.

Option C: Grounds include treason and bribery. The Constitution does list treason and bribery as specific grounds. So C is definitely true. So it's not the answer.

Option D: Three-fourths vote in the Senate is needed to convict. Hmm, I think the Senate requires a two-thirds majority to convict, not three-fourths. Because I remember that impeachment in the Senate needs a supermajority, but it's two-thirds, not three-fourths. So D is not correct. Because if D says three-fourths, that's wrong.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. The Constitution says that the Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments. When the President is tried, the Chief Justice presides. To convict, it's two-thirds of the members present. So D says three-fourths, which is incorrect. So the statement in D is false, making D the correct answer to the question because the question asks which is NOT true.

So the question is which statement is NOT true. So the false statement is D.

The correct answer is:

D

The question asks which statement about impeachment is NOT true. Among the options, option D claims that a three-fourths vote in the Senate is necessary to convict and remove from office. However, according to the U.S. Constitution, impeachment in the Senate requires a two-thirds majority vote, not three-fourths. Therefore, option D is false and is the correct answer.

Answer: D
