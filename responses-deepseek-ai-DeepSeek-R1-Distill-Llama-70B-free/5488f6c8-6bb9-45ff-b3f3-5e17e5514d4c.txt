Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the density of hydrogen gas. Let me try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the question says that 2.02 grams of hydrogen gas occupies 22.4 liters. And I need to find the density in grams per milliliter. Hmm, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. So density (d) equals mass (m) over volume (V), right? So d = m/V.

Wait, but the units here are grams and liters. I need to convert liters to milliliters because the answer needs to be in grams per milliliter. Oh right, because 1 liter is 1000 milliliters. So 22.4 liters would be 22.4 * 1000 ml. Let me calculate that. 22.4 * 1000 is 22400 ml. Oh wait, wait, 22.4 liters is 22.4 * 1000 which is 22400 milliliters. So the volume is 22400 ml.

So mass is 2.02 grams. So density is 2.02 grams divided by 22400 ml. Let me write that out: 2.02 / 22400. Hmm, maybe I can simplify that. Let me see, 2.02 divided by 22400. I can write both as the same unit, but perhaps I can divide numerator and denominator by 2 to make it easier. 2.02 divided by 2 is 1.01, and 22400 divided by 2 is 11200. So now it's 1.01 g / 11200 ml. 

Wait, maybe I can express this in scientific notation. 1.01 / 11200. Let me compute that. 11200 is 1.12e4. So 1.01e0 / 1.12e4 = (1.01/1.12) * 10^(-4). Let me compute 1.01 divided by 1.12. Hmm, 1.01 is just a bit less than 1.12. Let me approximate. 1.12 times 0.9 is 1.008. Oh, so 0.9 times 1.12 is 1.008. So 1.01 is a bit more than 0.9 times 1.12. So approximately 0.902. So (1.01/1.12) is approximately 0.902. So now, multiply by 1e-4. So 0.902e-4 grams per milliliter.

Wait, that's 9.02e-5 g/ml. Let me check the options. Looking at the options, option I is 9.0 × 10^-5 g/ml. Oh, but wait, wait. Let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

Wait, another approach: 22.4 liters is 22.4 * 1000 ml = 22400 ml. So 2.02 grams / 22400 ml = 2.02 / 22400. Let me compute that. 2.02 divided by 22400 equals approximately 0.0000902 g/ml. Which is 9.02e-5 g/ml, so that's 9.0e-5 when rounded to two significant figures. So the answer should be option I.

But wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me use another method. 22400 divided by 2.02 is the volume per gram, but I'm looking for grams per volume. Wait, no, density is mass/volume, so it's 2.02 / 22400.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 2.02 / 22.4 first, and then adjust the units. Because 22.4 liters is 22.4 * 1000 ml, so 22400 ml. So 2.02 g / 22400 ml = (2.02 / 22.4) / 1000. Let me compute 2.02 / 22.4.

2.02 divided by 22.4. Hmm, 22.4 is roughly twice 11.2, and 2.02 is roughly 0.18 times 11.2. Wait, maybe another approach. Let me do 2.02 ÷ 22.4:

22.4 goes into 2.02 how many times? 22.4 is bigger than 2.02, so it's 0.09 times because 22.4 * 0.09 equals 2.016. Oh, that's very close to 2.02. So 2.02 / 22.4 ≈ 0.09 g/liter.

Wait, but that's grams per liter. To convert to grams per milliliter, I need to divide by 1000 liters per milliliter? Wait no, wait. Because 1 liter is 1000 milliliters, so 1 g/liter is 0.001 g/ml. So 0.09 g/liter is 0.09 * 0.001 g/ml, which is 9e-5 g/ml. So that's 9.0e-5, which is option I.

Wait, but earlier I thought of 0.0000902, which is 9.02e-5. So that's consistent. So the correct answer should be I.

Looking at the options again, I is 9.0 ×10^-5 g/ml. So that's the one.

To calculate the density of hydrogen gas in grams per milliliter, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Density} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}}
\]

The given mass is 2.02 g, and the volume is 22.4 liters. Since the density needs to be in grams per milliliter, we first convert the volume to milliliters:

\[
22.4 \, \text{liters} \times 1000 \, \frac{\text{milliliters}}{\text{liter}} = 22,400 \, \text{milliliters}.
\]

Now, calculate the density:

\[
\text{Density} = \frac{2.02 \, \text{g}}{22,400 \, \text{ml}} = 0.0000902 \, \text{g/ml}.
\]

Expressing this in scientific notation:

\[
0.0000902 \, \text{g/ml} = 9.02 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{g/ml}.
\]

Rounding to two significant figures:

\[
\text{Density} = 9.0 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{g/ml}.
\]

Comparing this result with the provided options, the correct answer is:

**I: 9.0 × 10⁻⁵ g/ml.**
