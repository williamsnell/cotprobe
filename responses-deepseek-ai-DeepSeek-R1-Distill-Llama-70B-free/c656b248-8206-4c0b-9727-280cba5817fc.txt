Question:

An experiment was designed to test the effects of three different types of paint on the durability of wooden toys. Because boys and girls tend to play differently with toys, a randomly selected group of children was divided into two groups by sex. Which of the following statements about this experiment is true?

Options:

A: There are only three treatment combinations in this experiment.
B: This is a completely randomized design.
C: The sex of the children does not affect the experiment results.
D: Sex is a blocking factor.
E: The type of wooden toys is a blocking factor.
F: Type of paint is a blocking factor.
G: The durability of toys is a blocking factor.
H: This experiment does not have any blocking factors.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this statistics question about an experiment involving paint types on wooden toys. Let me break it down step by step.

The question says that an experiment was designed to test three different types of paint on the durability of wooden toys. The children were randomly selected and then divided into two groups based on their sex. I need to figure out which statement about this setup is true.

First, I remember that in experimental design, there are terms like treatment, blocking factors, completely randomized designs, etc. The key here is to understand the setup.

So, the experiment is about paint types affecting durability. The independent variable here is the type of paint. They're using three types, so that's three levels of treatment.

Now, the children are divided into groups by sex. The question is why they did that. I think this is about blocking variables. Blocking is done to account for variability that's not part of the treatment but could affect the outcome. So if boys and girls play differently, which might affect how durable the toys are, then dividing them by sex would control for that variability.

Wait, in a completely randomized design, subjects are randomly assigned to treatment groups without any blocking. But here, they're first divided by sex, so that suggests blocking. So this might be a randomized block design, not a completely randomized design.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Only three treatment combinations. Hmm, the treatments are the three paints. But if they have two sexes, does that create more treatment levels? Wait, no. Each paint type is a treatment; the blocking factor (sex) affects the groups but not the treatment. So the number of treatment combinations is just three, regardless of blocking. So A might be correct, but I need to think more.

Option B: Completely randomized design. I don't think so, because they've blocked by sex. So it's a randomized block design, not completely randomized. So B is probably false.

Option C: Sex doesn't affect results. But the experiment is designed because sex might affect play, hence durability. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Sex is a blocking factor. Yes, that makes sense. They divided into groups (blocks) based on sex to control for variability. So D is correct.

Option E: Type of toys is a blocking factor. The question doesn't mention different types of toys. It's about the same wooden toys, just different paints. So E isn't applicable.

Option F: Paint type is a blocking factor. No, paint type is the treatment, not the blocking factor. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Durability is a blocking factor. No, durability is the dependent variable, the outcome measured. So G is wrong.

Option H: No blocking factors. But they did block by sex, so H is false.

So the correct statement is D: Sex is a blocking factor.

The experiment involves testing three types of paint on the durability of wooden toys, with children divided into groups by sex to account for potential differences in play behavior. This division by sex is a blocking factor, as it controls for variability that could affect the outcome. The experiment is not a completely randomized design because blocking is used. The number of treatment combinations is three, corresponding to the paint types, and other options about blocking factors are incorrect because the blocking factor is sex, not paint or toys.
