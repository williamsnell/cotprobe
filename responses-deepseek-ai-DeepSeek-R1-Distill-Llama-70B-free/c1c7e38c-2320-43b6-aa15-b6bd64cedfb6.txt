Okay, I need to answer this question about self-monitoring as per Snyder's theory. Let me try to recall what I know about this.

So, self-monitoring is a personality trait, right? People who are high in self-monitoring are more likely to adjust their behavior based on social situations. They monitor their self-presentation and change their actions to fit in. On the other hand, those low in self-monitoring don't change as much. They probably act based on their own internal states.

The question is asking what someone low in self-monitoring relies on when deciding how to act. The options are A through J. Let me go through them.

Option A: Life scripts. I'm not too sure what that refers to. Maybe like a set of routines or plans, but I don't think it's directly related to self-monitoring.

Option B: Past experiences. That could be possible. People might rely on what's worked before. But I'm not certain if that's the main thing for low self-monitors.

Option C: Advice from friends or family. That seems more like taking others' opinions, which might be more for high self-monitors trying to fit in.

Option D: Random decisions. That doesn't make sense. People usually base decisions on something, not randomness.

Option E: Societal norms. High self-monitors would care more about societal expectations, so low self-monitors might not rely on this as much.

Option F: Internal working models from infancy. That sounds like attachment theory, maybe, but I'm not sure how it ties to self-monitoring.

Option G: Popular trends. Again, that's more about fitting in with current fads, which seems like high self-monitoring behavior.

Option H: Emotional reactions of others. High self-monitors would pay attention to others' emotions to adjust their behavior. Low self-monitors might not focus on that as much.

Option I: Expectations of authority figures. That's similar to societal norms, probably more for high self-monitors.

Option J: Their own feelings, attitudes, and beliefs. This rings a bell. Low self-monitors are supposed to be more true to themselves, acting based on their internal feelings rather than external cues.

So putting it together, someone low in self-monitoring would rely on their own feelings and beliefs. That's option J.

A person low in self-monitoring, according to Snyder's theory, tends to act based on their own internal states rather than external social cues. Among the options provided, the correct answer is that they rely on their own feelings, attitudes, and beliefs when deciding how to act in a social situation.

Answer: J
