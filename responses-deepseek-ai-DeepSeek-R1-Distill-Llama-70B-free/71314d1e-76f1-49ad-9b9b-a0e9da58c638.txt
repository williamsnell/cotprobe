Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the inverse Laplace transform of a given function F(s). The function is (s² + 3s + 1) divided by (s + 1)^3 times (s + 2)^2. Hmm, I remember that to find the inverse Laplace, I should probably use partial fraction decomposition.

Wait, the denominator is factored into (s+1)^3 and (s+2)^2. So I need to express F(s) as a sum of fractions with denominators (s+1), (s+1)^2, (s+1)^3, and similarly for (s+2) terms. Let me write that out.

So, F(s) = (s² + 3s +1) / [(s+1)^3 (s+2)^2] = A/(s+1) + B/(s+1)^2 + C/(s+1)^3 + D/(s+2) + E/(s+2)^2.

Now, I need to find the constants A, B, C, D, E. To do that, I'll multiply both sides by the denominator to get rid of the fractions. So,

s² + 3s +1 = A(s+1)^2(s+2)^2 + B(s+1)(s+2)^2 + C(s+2)^2 + D(s+1)^3(s+2) + E(s+1)^3.

Wait, no, wait, let me correct that. Because when I multiply through, each term will have the other denominators as well. Let me think again. Oh right, when I clear the denominators, the equation becomes:

(s² +3s +1) = A(s+1)^2(s+2)^2 + B(s+1)(s+2)^2 + C(s+2)^2 + D(s+1)^3(s+2) + E(s+1)^3.

Wait, no. Wait, the denominator is (s+1)^3 (s+2)^2. So when I multiply both sides by that, the left side is s² +3s +1. The right side would be A*(s+1)^2 (s+2)^2 + B*(s+1)(s+2)^2 + C*(s+2)^2 + D*(s+1)^3 (s+2) + E*(s+1)^3. Hmm, I think that's correct.

Wait no, actually, the general form for partial fractions when you have repeated linear factors is sum from i=1 to 3 of A_i/(s+1)^i and sum from j=1 to 2 of B_j/(s+2)^j. So, F(s) = A1/(s+1) + A2/(s+1)^2 + A3/(s+1)^3 + B1/(s+2) + B2/(s+2)^2.

So when I multiply both sides by (s+1)^3 (s+2)^2, I get:

s² +3s +1 = A1 (s+1)^2 (s+2)^2 + A2 (s+1)(s+2)^2 + A3 (s+2)^2 + B1 (s+1)^3 (s+2) + B2 (s+1)^3.

Okay, so now I need to expand all these terms and then collect like terms to solve for the coefficients A1, A2, A3, B1, B2.

Alternatively, I can substitute suitable values of s to simplify. For example, let s = -1, which will zero out the terms from (s+2)^2 and (s+2). Similarly, s = -2 will zero out the terms from (s+1)^3 and (s+1)^2 etc.

Let me try that. Let's substitute s = -1:

Left side: (-1)^2 +3*(-1) +1 = 1 -3 +1 = -1.

Right side: A1*(0)^2*(1)^2 + A2*(0)*(1)^2 + A3*(1)^2 + B1*(0)^3*(1) + B2*(0)^3.

So only A3*(1)^2 remains: A3 *1 = A3.

So, -1 = A3 → A3 = -1.

Similarly, substitute s = -2:

Left side: (-2)^2 +3*(-2) +1 =4 -6 +1 = -1.

Right side: A1*( -1 )^2 * 0^2 + A2*(-1)*0^2 + A3*0^2 + B1*(-1)^3 *0 + B2*(-1)^3.

So only B2*(-1)^3 remains: B2*(-1)^3 = -B2.

So, -1 = -B2 → B2 =1.

Now, I need to find A1, A2, B1. Hmm, but I have three unknowns left. So I need to choose other values or equate coefficients.

Alternatively, expand all the terms and equate coefficients of s^4, s^3, s^2, s, and the constant term.

Wait, but the left side is s² +3s +1, so terms up to s². The right side, after expansion, will have higher degrees, so I'll have to set coefficients for higher powers to zero.

Let me try expanding the right side.

Start with A1*(s+1)^2*(s+2)^2.

Expanding (s+1)^2 = s² +2s +1.

(s+2)^2 = s² +4s +4.

Multiply them together: (s² +2s +1)(s² +4s +4) = s^4 +6s³ +13s² +12s +4.

Multiply by A1: A1 s^4 +6A1 s³ +13A1 s² +12A1 s +4A1.

Next term: A2*(s+1)(s+2)^2.

(s+1) = s +1.

(s+2)^2 = s² +4s +4.

Multiply: (s+1)(s² +4s +4) = s^3 +5s² +8s +4.

Multiply by A2: A2 s^3 +5A2 s² +8A2 s +4A2.

Next term: A3*(s+2)^2: which is A3 (s² +4s +4) → A3 s² +4A3 s +4A3.

Next term: B1 (s+1)^3 (s+2).

(s+1)^3 = s^3 +3s^2 +3s +1.

Multiply by (s+2): (s^3 +3s^2 +3s +1)(s+2) = s^4 +5s³ +11s² +11s +2.

Multiply by B1: B1 s^4 +5B1 s³ +11B1 s² +11B1 s +2B1.

Next term: B2 (s+1)^3: which is B2 (s^3 +3s^2 +3s +1) → B2 s³ +3B2 s² +3B2 s +B2.

Now, sum all these terms:

Let me collect terms by degree.

s^4: A1 + B1.

s^3: 6A1 + A2 +5B1 + B2.

s^2:13A1 +5A2 +A3 +11B1 +3B2.

s^1:12A1 +8A2 +4A3 +11B1 +3B2.

s^0:4A1 +4A2 +4A3 +2B1 +B2.

And remember the left side is s² +3s +1. So the right side must equal this. Therefore, the coefficients for s^4, s^3, and higher must be zero, and the coefficients for s^2, s^1, s^0 must match 1, 3, 1 respectively.

So, setting up equations:

For s^4: A1 + B1 = 0. (Equation 1)

For s^3: 6A1 + A2 + 5B1 + B2 = 0. (Equation 2)

For s^2:13A1 +5A2 +A3 +11B1 +3B2 =1. (Equation 3)

For s^1:12A1 +8A2 +4A3 +11B1 +3B2 =3. (Equation 4)

For s^0:4A1 +4A2 +4A3 +2B1 +B2 =1. (Equation 5)

We already have A3 = -1 and B2 =1.

So substitute these into the equations.

Equation 1: A1 + B1 = 0 → B1 = -A1.

Equation 2: 6A1 + A2 +5B1 +1 =0.

But B1 = -A1, so 6A1 + A2 +5*(-A1) +1 = 0 → (6A1 -5A1) + A2 +1 =0 → A1 + A2 +1=0 → A2 = -A1 -1.

Equation 3: 13A1 +5A2 + (-1) +11B1 +3*(1) =1.

Substitute B1 = -A1 and A2 = -A1 -1.

13A1 +5*(-A1 -1) -1 +11*(-A1) +3 =1.

Compute each term:

13A1 -5A1 -5 -1 -11A1 +3 =1.

Combine like terms:

(13A1 -5A1 -11A1) + (-5 -1 +3) =1.

( (13-5-11) A1 ) + (-3) =1 → (-3A1) -3 =1 → -3A1 =4 → A1 = -4/3.

Hmm, that's a fraction. Let me check my substitution again.

Wait, equation 3 substitute:

13A1 +5A2 +A3 +11B1 +3B2 =1.

A3= -1, B2=1.

So 13A1 +5A2 -1 +11B1 +3*1 =1.

Which becomes 13A1 +5A2 +11B1 +2 =1 → 13A1 +5A2 +11B1 = -1.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express equation 3 correctly.

Wait, 13A1 +5A2 + A3 +11B1 +3B2 =1.

With A3=-1, B2=1:

13A1 +5A2 + (-1) +11B1 +3*(1) =1.

→ 13A1 +5A2 +11B1 +2 =1 → 13A1 +5A2 +11B1 = -1.

But since B1 = -A1, substitute:

13A1 +5A2 +11*(-A1) = -1 → 13A1 +5A2 -11A1 = -1 → (2A1) +5A2 = -1.

But from equation 2, after substitution, we have A2 = -A1 -1.

So substitute A2:

2A1 +5*(-A1 -1) = -1 → 2A1 -5A1 -5 = -1 → (-3A1) -5 = -1 → -3A1 =4 → A1= -4/3.

Hmm, that seems correct.

Now, B1 = -A1 = 4/3.

A2 = -A1 -1 = 4/3 -1 = 1/3.

Now, equation 4: 12A1 +8A2 +4A3 +11B1 +3B2 =3.

Substitute all knowns:

A1=-4/3, A2=1/3, A3=-1, B1=4/3, B2=1.

So compute each term:

12*(-4/3) = -16.

8*(1/3) = 8/3.

4*(-1) = -4.

11*(4/3) = 44/3.

3*(1) =3.

Add them all together: -16 + (8/3) -4 + (44/3) +3.

Convert to thirds:

-16 = -48/3, -4 = -12/3, 3=9/3.

So total: (-48/3 +8/3 -12/3 +44/3 +9/3) = [ (-48+8-12+44+9) ] /3 = ( ( (-48-12) + (8+44+9) ) ) / 3 → (-60 +61)/3 = 1/3.

But equation 4 expects this sum to be 3. Wait, 1/3 is not 3. That's a problem. That suggests an error in the calculations.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in expanding the right-hand side terms. Let me double-check the expansion steps.

Wait, when I expanded B1*(s+1)^3*(s+2), I got s^4 +5s^3 +11s^2 +11s +2. Let me re-calculate that.

(s+1)^3 is s³ +3s² +3s +1.

Multiply by (s+2):

s^4 + 2s^3 +3s^3 +6s^2 +3s^2 +6s + s + 2.

Wait, no, more carefully:

(s³ +3s² +3s +1) * (s + 2) = s^4 +2s³ +3s³ +6s² +3s² +6s + s +2.

Combine terms:

s^4 + (2s³ +3s³) = s^4 +5s³.

s² terms: 6s² +3s² =9s².

s terms:6s +s=7s.

Constants: 2.

Wait, so the expansion is s^4 +5s³ +9s² +7s +2.

Oh, I think I made a mistake earlier. So the correct expansion is s^4 +5s³ +9s² +7s +2.

So in the earlier steps, I had 11s^2, but it should be 9s² and 7s.

Similarly, when I multiplied B1*(s+1)^3*(s+2), the expansion is s^4 +5s³ +9s² +7s +2.

So that changes the coefficients in the equations. Let me correct that.

So, earlier, the right side expansion for B1*(s+1)^3*(s+2) was s^4 +5s^3 +9s^2 +7s +2.

Ah, so the coefficients for B1 terms are:

s^4: B1.

s^3:5B1.

s^2:9B1.

s^1:7B1.

s^0: 2B1.

Similarly, the term for B2*(s+1)^3 is B2 s³ +3B2 s^2 +3B2 s +B2.

So now, let's re-collect the terms.

Rewriting the right side:

A1*(s^4 +6s³ +13s² +12s +4) +

A2*(s^3 +5s² +8s +4) +

A3*(s² +4s +4) +

B1*(s^4 +5s³ +9s² +7s +2) +

B2*(s³ +3s^2 +3s +1).

Now, grouping by s^4, s^3, etc.

s^4: A1 + B1.

s^3: 6A1 + A2 +5B1 + B2.

s^2:13A1 +5A2 +A3 +9B1 +3B2.

s^1:12A1 +8A2 +4A3 +7B1 +3B2.

s^0:4A1 +4A2 +4A3 +2B1 + B2.

Now, the left side is s² +3s +1, so:

s^4: 0.

s^3: 0.

s^2:1.

s^1:3.

s^0:1.

So the equations become:

1. A1 + B1 =0 → B1 = -A1.

2.6A1 + A2 +5B1 + B2 =0.

3.13A1 +5A2 +A3 +9B1 +3B2=1.

4.12A1 +8A2 +4A3 +7B1 +3B2=3.

5.4A1 +4A2 +4A3 +2B1 +B2=1.

We know A3=-1, B2=1.

So plug A3=-1 and B2=1 into the equations.

Equation 2:6A1 + A2 +5*(-A1) +1=0 →6A1 +A2 -5A1 +1=0 → A1 + A2 +1=0 →A2 = -A1 -1.

Equation 3: 13A1 +5A2 + (-1) +9*(-A1) +3*(1)=1 →13A1 +5A2 -1 -9A1 +3=1 → (13A1 -9A1) +5A2 +2 =1 →4A1 +5A2 = -1.

But A2 = -A1 -1, so substitute:

4A1 +5*(-A1 -1) = -1 →4A1 -5A1 -5 = -1 →-A1 -5 = -1 →-A1 =4 → A1= -4.

Then, B1= -A1=4.

A2= -(-4) -1 =4-1=3.

Now, let's check equation 4.

Equation 4:12A1 +8A2 +4A3 +7B1 +3B2=3.

Substitute the known values: A1=-4, A2=3, A3=-1, B1=4, B2=
