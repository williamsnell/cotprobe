Okay, so I have this probability problem here about rolling a die multiple times. Let me try to understand what's being asked.

The question is: We roll a fair 6-sided die 5 times. What is the probability that we get a 6 in at most 2 of the rolls? The options are from A to J.

Alright, so I think this is a binomial probability problem because each roll is an independent trial with two possible outcomes: success (rolling a 6) or failure (not rolling a 6). The die is fair, so the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/6, and not rolling a 6 is 5/6.

The problem asks for the probability of getting at most 2 sixes in 5 rolls. That means I need to calculate the probability for getting 0 sixes, 1 six, or 2 sixes, and then sum those probabilities together.

I remember the formula for the binomial probability: P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k), where C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time.

So for this problem, n is 5 (since we roll the die 5 times), p is 1/6, and k will be 0, 1, 2.

Let me calculate each term separately.

First, for k=0:
C(5, 0) is 1, since there's only one way to choose none from five.
p^0 is 1.
(5/6)^5 is (5/6) raised to the 5th power.
So P(0) = 1 * 1 * (5/6)^5.

Next, for k=1:
C(5, 1) is 5, because there are 5 ways to choose one roll to be a 6.
p^1 is 1/6.
(5/6)^(5-1) is (5/6)^4.
So P(1) = 5 * (1/6) * (5/6)^4.

Then, for k=2:
C(5, 2) is 10, since 5 choose 2 is 10.
p^2 is (1/6)^2.
(5/6)^(5-2) is (5/6)^3.
So P(2) = 10 * (1/6)^2 * (5/6)^3.

Now, I need to calculate each of these terms and sum them up.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, (5/6)^5. Let me compute 5^5 and 6^5.

5^5 = 3125
6^5 = 7776
So (5/6)^5 is 3125/7776.

Wait, wait. Wait, 6^5 is 6*6*6*6*6. 6^2=36, 6^3=216, 6^4=1296, 6^5=7776. Yes.

Similarly, (5/6)^4 is (5^4)/(6^4) = 625/1296.

And (5/6)^3 is 125/216.

So now, let's plug these into each P(k).

P(0) = 1 * 1 * (3125/7776) = 3125/7776.

P(1) = 5 * (1/6) * (625/1296).

Wait, let me compute that. Let's break it down.

5*(1/6) = 5/6.

Then, (5/6)*(625/1296) = (5 * 625) / (6 * 1296).

5*625 is 3125. 6*1296 is 7776.

So P(1) = 3125/7776.

Wait, that's the same as P(0). Hmm, that can't be right. Let me check.

Wait no, I think I made a mistake in the calculation for P(1). Let's go again.

P(1) = C(5,1) * (1/6)^1 * (5/6)^4.

C(5,1)=5. So:

5 * (1/6) * (5^4)/(6^4) = 5*(1/6)*(625)/(1296).

So 5 * 625 = 3125, and 6*1296=7776. So yes, P(1)=3125/7776.

Wait, but wait, that's the same as P(0). That can't be correct, because getting one success should be more probable than zero, right?

Wait a second, no, maybe not necessarily. Let's think. When p is small, like 1/6, the probabilities might actually be such that P(0) is higher than P(1). Hmm, maybe that's correct. Let me see.

But let me think about the general case. For a binomial distribution with small p, the distribution is skewed towards 0. So P(0) is the highest, then P(1) is lower, etc. Wait, but in this case, p is 1/6, which is not extremely small, but moderate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute P(0) and P(1) again.

P(0) = (5/6)^5 = (3125)/(7776) ≈ 0.4019.

P(1) = 5*(1/6)*(5/6)^4 = 5*(1/6)*(625/1296) = (5 * 625) / (6 * 1296) = 3125 / 7776 ≈ 0.4019.

Wait, so both P(0) and P(1) are equal? That seems a bit strange, but perhaps it's correct. Let me check the math again.

Yes, because (5/6)^5 is 3125/7776. And P(1) is 5*(1/6)*(5/6)^4. (5/6)^4 is 625/1296. 625/1296 multiplied by 1/6 is 625/(6*1296) = 625/7776. Multiply by 5 gives 3125/7776. So yes, same as P(0). Interesting.

So P(0) and P(1) are the same in this case. Hmm.

Now, P(2): C(5,2)*(1/6)^2*(5/6)^3.

C(5,2) is 10.

(1/6)^2 is 1/36.

(5/6)^3 is 125/216.

So P(2) = 10 * (1/36) * (125/216).

Let me compute that:

Multiply 10, 1/36, and 125/216.

10 * (1/36) = 10/36 = 5/18.

5/18 * 125/216 = (5 * 125) / (18 * 216) = 625 / 3888.

Wait, let me compute 18*216. 18*200=3600, 18*16=288, so total 3888.

So P(2) is 625/3888.

Wait, but wait, 5/6 cubed is 125/216, that's correct. And 10*(1/36)=10/36=5/18.

So 5/18 * 125/216 = (5 * 125) / (18 * 216) = 625 / 3888.

But wait, 3888 is 6^5 * 6^something? Wait, 6^5 is 7776. Hmm.

Wait, but 3888 is 7776 / 2. So 625/3888 is equal to 625/(7776/2) ) = 1250/7776.

Wait, because 625*2=1250, and 3888*2=7776.

So P(2)=1250/7776.

Wait, but let me make sure. So 10*(1/36)*(125/216) = 10*(125) / (36*216) )= 1250 / 7776.

Yes, because 36*216 = (6^2)*(6^3) )=6^(2+3)=6^5=7776.

So P(2) = 1250/7776.

Wait, but earlier I thought (5/6)^3 was 125/216, which is correct, because 5^3=125, 6^3=216.

So now, the total probability is P(0) + P(1) + P(2) = (3125 + 3125 + 1250)/7776.

Wait, wait, no. Because P(0) is 3125/7776, P(1) is 3125/7776, and P(2) is 1250/7776.

So adding them together: 3125 + 3125 = 6250. 6250 + 1250 = 7500.

So total probability is 7500/7776.

Wait, but that can't be right because 7500 is larger than 7776. Wait, no, 7500 is less than 7776.

Wait, 7500 divided by 7776. Let me compute that fraction.

Wait, 7500/7776. Let me see if I can simplify this.

Divide numerator and denominator by 12: 7500 ÷12=625, 7776 ÷12=648.

So 625/648.

Wait, so the probability is 625/648? But wait, let me check again: 3125 +3125 =6250, plus 1250 equals 7500. So 7500/7776 reduces to 625/648.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 625/648. So that's the answer?

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check the calculations because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, when I calculated P(2), I thought it was 1250/7776, but let me make sure.

P(2) is 10*(1/6)^2*(5/6)^3.

(1/6)^2 is 1/36. (5/6)^3 is 125/216.

So 10*(1/36)*(125/216) = 10 * (125) / (36*216) )

36*216 = 7776. So 10*125 = 1250. So 1250/7776.

Yes, correct.

So P(0) is 3125/7776, P(1) is 3125/7776, P(2) is 1250/7776.

Adding together: 3125 + 3125 =6250, plus 1250 is 7500. So 7500/7776.

Simplify 7500/7776.

Let me divide numerator and denominator by 12: 7500 ÷12=625, 7776 ÷12=648.

So 625/648. Which matches option C.

Wait, but let me think about whether this is correct. Because 625/648 is greater than 1, which is impossible for a probability. Wait, 625/648 is approximately 0.964, which is less than 1. Oh wait, no, 625 is less than 648. So 625/648 is about 0.964, which is 96.4% probability, which seems high but possible.

Wait, but wait, 5 rolls, probability of getting at most 2 sixes. Since each roll has a 1/6 chance, getting 0,1, or 2 sixes should be the majority of the cases, so a high probability makes sense.

But let me check the calculation steps again to make sure.

Wait, P(0) is (5/6)^5 = 3125/7776.

P(1) is 5*(1/6)*(5/6)^4 = 5*(1/6)*(625/1296) = (5*625)/(6*1296) = 3125/7776.

P(2) is 10*(1/6)^2*(5/6)^3 = 10*(1/36)*(125/216) = (10*125)/(36*216) )= 1250/7776.

Adding all together: 3125 +3125 +1250 = 7500. 7500/7776 = 625/648.

Wait, but 7500/7776 simplifies to 625/648 because 7500 ÷12 is 625 and 7776 ÷12 is 648.

So the probability is 625/648, which is option C.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 625/648. So that's the correct answer.

To solve the problem, we calculate the probability of rolling a 6 in at most 2 out of 5 rolls of a fair 6-sided die. This is a binomial probability problem with parameters:

- **Number of trials (n):** 5 (since the die is rolled 5 times)
- **Probability of success (p):** \( \frac{1}{6} \) (probability of rolling a 6)
- **Probability of failure (1-p):** \( \frac{5}{6} \) (probability of not rolling a 6)

The probability of getting **exactly \( k \)** sixes in 5 rolls is given by the binomial formula:

\[
P(k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
\]

We need to calculate \( P(0) \), \( P(1) \), and \( P(2) \), and sum them to find the probability of getting at most 2 sixes.

---

### Step 1: Calculate \( P(0) \) (probability of 0 sixes)
\[
P(0) = \binom{5}{0} \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^0 \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^5 = 1 \cdot 1 \cdot \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^5 = \frac{3125}{7776}
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate \( P(1) \) (probability of 1 six)
\[
P(1) = \binom{5}{1} \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^1 \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4 = 5 \cdot \frac{1}{6} \cdot \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4 = 5 \cdot \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{625}{1296} = \frac{3125}{7776}
\]

---

### Step 3: Calculate \( P(2) \) (probability of 2 sixes)
\[
P(2) = \binom{5}{2} \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^2 \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^3 = 10 \cdot \frac{1}{36} \cdot \frac{125}{216} = 10 \cdot \frac{1}{36} \cdot \frac{125}{216} = \frac{1250}{7776}
\]

---

### Step 4: Sum the probabilities
The total probability of getting at most 2 sixes is:
\[
P(0) + P(1) + P(2) = \frac{3125}{7776} + \frac{3125}{7776} + \frac{1250}{7776} = \frac{7500}{7776}
\]

Simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by 12:
\[
\frac{7500}{7776} = \frac{625}{648}
\]

---

### Final Answer
The probability of rolling a 6 in at most 2 of the 5 rolls is \( \frac{625}{648} \), which corresponds to **option C**.
