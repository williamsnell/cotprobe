Okay, so I've got this problem here about Mr. Johnson discounting a draft. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on finance terms, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The draft is non-interest bearing and is due on July 12th. Mr. Johnson is discounting it on July 1st. The discount rate is 5%, and we need to calculate his proceeds. They also mentioned a 365-day year, which probably affects the interest calculation.

Wait, so a non-interest bearing draft means it's not earning interest on its own, right? So when you discount it, you're essentially getting the present value of that future amount. The formula for present value when discounting comes to mind here.

I remember the formula for present value (PV) when you have simple interest is PV = FV / (1 + rt). But wait, another thought: since the draft is non-interest bearing, maybe it's a simple discount situation rather than compound interest. Oh right, for simple interest or discount, the formula would be slightly different.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the discount amount first. The discount is calculated on the face value based on the time until maturity.

The face value is $850, due on July 12. Today is July 1. So how many days are between July 1 and July 12? Let's count: 1st to 12th is 11 days, but wait, when you're counting days for interest, do you include both start and end dates? No, I think it's the number of days from the start date to the day before the end date. So from July 1 to July 12 is 11 days. Or wait, if you're discounting it on July 1, then the time remaining is from July 1 to July 12, which is 11 days. Because July 1 is when you're calculating, so the next day is July 2, and the 12th is the due date. So 12 minus 1 gives 11 days.

So time in years would be 11 days divided by 365. Let me calculate that: 11/365. Let me see, 365 divided by 11 is about 0.030136... So approximately 0.03014 years.

The discount rate is 5%, which is 0.05 in decimal. So the discount amount is the face value multiplied by the rate multiplied by time. So that's 850 * 0.05 * (11/365).

Let me compute that. 850 times 0.05 is 42.5. Then multiply by 11: 42.5 * 11 equals 467.5. Then divide by 365: 467.5 / 365. Let's compute that. 365 times 1.28 is 467.2, right? Wait, 365 * 1.28 = 365*(1 + 0.28) = 365 + (365*0.28). 365 * 0.28 is 102.2, so 365 + 102.2 = 467.2. So 467.5 is 0.3 more than that. So 467.5 / 365 = approx 1.2818.

Wait, wait, no, I think I messed up. Because the discount amount is 850 * 0.05 * (11/365). Let me compute each step step by step.

First, 850 * 0.05 = 42.5. Then, 42.5 multiplied by 11 is 467.5. Then, 467.5 divided by 365 is the discount amount.

So 467.5 / 365. Let me compute that. 365 * 1.28 is 467.2 as before, so 467.5 is 0.3 more. So 467.5 = 365 * 1.28 + 0.3. So 0.3 divided by 365 is approximately 0.0008219. So total is approximately 1.2808.

Wait, but 11 days is the time period. So the discount is 850 * 0.05 * (11/365). Let me calculate this more accurately.

Compute 11/365 first. 365 / 11 is approximately 33.1818, so 11/365 is approximately 0.030137. Now, 0.05 * 0.030137 = 0.00150685. Multiply by 850: 850 * 0.00150685. Let me compute that.

850 * 0.001 is 0.85. 850 * 0.0005 is 0.425. 0.00150685 is 0.0015 + 0.0000685. So 0.85 + (850 * 0.0000685). 850 * 0.0000685 is 0.058225. So total discount is 0.85 + 0.425 = 1.275 plus 0.058225, which is 1.333225. Wait, no, that can't be right because I think I messed up the calculation.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the exact decimal. Let me try:

11 days = 11/365 years = approx 0.0301369863 years.

Discount rate is 5% per annum, so discount amount is 850 * 0.05 * (11/365).

Compute 0.05 * 0.0301369863 = 0.0015068493.

Then, 850 * 0.0015068493 = ?

Let me compute 0.0015068493 * 850.

0.001 * 850 = 0.85

0.0005 *850 = 0.425 → 0.0015 is 1.275

Then 0.000068493 *850 → 0.058155.

Wait, no, wait: 0.0015068493 is 0.0015 + 0.000068493.

So 0.0015 *850 = 1.275.

0.000068493 *850 = approx 0.058155.

So total discount is 1.275 + 0.058155 = 1.333155.

So approximately $1.33 discount.

Wait, but wait, that seems low. Because 5% of 850 is 42.5 per year. For 11 days, it's 42.5 * (11/365) ≈ 1.28. So yeah, about $1.28 discount.

So the proceeds would be the face value minus the discount. So 850 - 1.28 = 848.72.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check the formula. Because if it's a discount, the formula is:

Proceeds = Face Value - (Face Value * rate * time).

Which is what I did. So 850 - (850 * 0.05 * (11/365)).

So 850 * 0.05 is 42.5. 42.5 * (11/365) is approximately 1.28.

So 850 - 1.28 = 848.72.

Looking at the options, option C is $848.72. So the answer should be C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of days. Wait, July 1 to July 12: from July 1 (today) to July 12 is 11 days. Because July 1 is day 0, and July 12 is day 11. So yes, 11 days.

Wait, another approach: using the exact formula.

Discount = FV * r * t.

t is 11/365.

So discount = 850 * 0.05 * (11/365) = (850 * 5 * 11) / (100 * 365).

Compute numerator: 850 *5=4250; 4250 *11=46,750.

Denominator: 100 *365=36,500.

So discount = 46,750 / 36,500 ≈ 1.2818.

So discount is approximately $1.28. So proceeds = 850 - 1.28 = 848.72.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: $848.72.

To calculate Mr. Johnson's proceeds from discounting the non-interest bearing draft, we first determine the discount amount. The draft has a face value of $850, a discount rate of 5% (or 0.05), and a time period of 11 days (from July 1 to July 12). Using a 365-day year, the time in years is calculated as:

\[
t = \frac{11}{365} \approx 0.0301369863
\]

The discount amount is then calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Discount} = \text{Face Value} \times r \times t
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Discount} = 850 \times 0.05 \times 0.0301369863 \approx 1.28
\]

The proceeds are the face value minus the discount:

\[
\text{Proceeds} = 850 - 1.28 = 848.72
\]

Thus, Mr. Johnson's proceeds are **$848.72**, which corresponds to option **C**.
