Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about a system with CO₂ gas that expands adiabatically. The initial conditions are 2.0 moles of CO₂ gas at 25°C and 10 atm pressure. It's confined in a cylinder with a cross-section of 10.0 cm². The gas expands against an external pressure of 1.0 atm, and the piston moves outward by 20 cm. We need to calculate the work done, w, and choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that in thermodynamics, work done during expansion is calculated using the formula w = -P_ext * ΔV. Since the process is adiabatic, there's no heat exchange, so Q=0. That means the first law, ΔU = Q + w, becomes ΔU = w. But wait, the question is only asking for w, so maybe I can focus on that.

First, I need to find the change in volume, ΔV. The cylinder's cross-section is given, and the piston moves 20 cm. So the volume change is the area multiplied by the distance moved.

Wait, but units. The cross-section is in cm², and the movement is in cm. So ΔV would be in cm³, which I'll need to convert to liters or m³, depending on the pressure units.

Let me write down the values:
- Cross-sectional area, A = 10.0 cm² = 10.0 cm * cm. But wait, 1 cm² = (0.01 m)^2 = 1e-4 m². Wait, no, 1 cm is 0.01 m, so 1 cm² is (0.01 m)^2 = 1e-4 m². So 10 cm² is 10 * 1e-4 m² = 1e-3 m².

The piston moves 20 cm, which is 0.2 meters. So the change in volume ΔV is A * distance = 1e-3 m² * 0.2 m = 0.2e-3 m³. Wait, 1e-3 is 0.001, multiplied by 0.2 gives 0.0002 m³. Alternatively, 0.2 cm³? Wait, no. Wait, 1 cm³ is 1e-6 m³, so 20 cm movement would be:

Wait, perhaps I should convert cm to meters. Alternatively, perhaps I should find ΔV in liters because the gas constant R is often used with liters·atm units.

Wait, let me think. The cross-section is 10 cm², which is 10 * (1 cm)^2. Since 1 cm = 0.01 m, 1 cm² is 0.0001 m². So 10 cm² is 0.001 m². The piston moves 20 cm, which is 0.2 m. So the volume change is A * d = 0.001 m² * 0.2 m = 0.0002 m³. To convert that to liters because 1 m³ is 1000 liters, so 0.0002 m³ * 1000 L/m³ = 0.2 L. Wait, no, 1 m³ is 10^3 L. So 0.0002 m³ is 0.0002 * 10^3 L = 0.2 L. So ΔV is 0.2 L.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that. 1 m³ is 1,000,000 liters? No, no, wait, 1 m³ is 1000 liters. Because 1 m = 100 cm, so 1 m³ is (100 cm)^3 = 1e6 cm³, and since 1 L = 1000 cm³, 1e6 cm³ = 1000 L. So 0.0002 m³ is 0.2 L. That makes sense.

But wait, the external pressure is given in atm, so using P in atm and V in L would be convenient because the gas constant R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K, but here we're calculating work which is P_ext * ΔV.

So work done by the system is w = -P_ext * ΔV. But wait, wait: the formula is w = -P_ext * ΔV when the system is expanding against a constant external pressure. So if the system pushes outward, the work is negative, as it's work done by the system.

So P_ext is 1.0 atm, ΔV is 0.2 L. So w = -1.0 atm * 0.2 L. But wait, that gives w in L·atm. I need to convert that to joules.

I remember that 1 L·atm is approximately 101.325 joules. So 0.2 L·atm would be 0.2 * 101.325 ≈ 20.265 J. But since the work is done by the system, it's negative, so w ≈ -20.265 J. Looking at the options, G is -20 J, which is close. So maybe that's the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculation. Let me go through each step again.

First, cross-sectional area: 10.0 cm². So that's 10 * (1 cm)^2. 1 cm is 0.01 m, so 1 cm² is (0.01)^2 = 0.0001 m². So 10 cm² = 0.001 m².

Piston moves 20 cm, which is 0.2 m. So ΔV is A * d = 0.001 m² * 0.2 m = 0.0002 m³.

Convert 0.0002 m³ to liters: since 1 m³ = 1000 L, 0.0002 m³ = 0.2 L. Correct.

So ΔV = 0.2 L. External pressure is 1 atm. So work w = -P_ext * ΔV = -1 atm * 0.2 L = -0.2 L·atm.

Convert to joules: 1 L·atm ≈ 101.325 J, so 0.2 * 101.325 ≈ 20.265 J. So w ≈ -20.265 J.

Looking at the options, G is -20 J, which matches. So the answer should be G.

But wait, I just recalled that sometimes, when a gas expands against an external pressure, the work done is calculated as P_ext multiplied by the change in volume, but the system's pressure might not be the same as P_ext. But in this case, since the expansion is against a constant external pressure, that's the correct approach.

Another thing to check: the units. Did I correctly convert cm² and cm to m³? Let me recheck:

Area = 10 cm² = 10*(1e-2 m)^2 = 10*(1e-4 m²) = 1e-3 m². Distance moved is 20 cm = 0.2 m. So volume change is 1e-3 * 0.2 = 0.0002 m³, which is 0.2 L. Correct.

So yes, w is approximately -20 J, so the answer is G.

To calculate the work done, \( w \), during the adiabatic expansion of \( 2.0 \, \mathrm{mol} \) of \( \mathrm{CO}_2 \) gas, we use the formula for work done against a constant external pressure:

\[
w = -P_{\text{ext}} \Delta V
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the change in volume (\( \Delta V \))
The gas expands as the piston moves outward through a distance of \( 20 \, \mathrm{cm} \) (or \( 0.2 \, \mathrm{m} \)) in a cylinder with a cross-sectional area of \( 10.0 \, \mathrm{cm}^2 \) (or \( 10 \times (0.01 \, \mathrm{m})^2 = 0.001 \, \mathrm{m}^2 \)).

\[
\Delta V = \text{Area} \times \text{distance moved} = 0.001 \, \mathrm{m}^2 \times 0.2 \, \mathrm{m} = 0.0002 \, \mathrm{m}^3
\]

Convert \( \Delta V \) to liters (\( 1 \, \mathrm{m}^3 = 1000 \, \mathrm{L} \)):

\[
\Delta V = 0.0002 \, \mathrm{m}^3 \times 1000 \, \mathrm{L/m}^3 = 0.2 \, \mathrm{L}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate work done (\( w \))
The external pressure is \( P_{\text{ext}} = 1.0 \, \mathrm{atm} \). Substituting into the formula:

\[
w = -P_{\text{ext}} \Delta V = -(1.0 \, \mathrm{atm}) (0.2 \, \mathrm{L}) = -0.2 \, \mathrm{L \cdot atm}
\]

Convert \( \mathrm{L \cdot atm} \) to joules (\( 1 \, \mathrm{L \cdot atm} = 101.325 \, \mathrm{J} \)):

\[
w = -0.2 \, \mathrm{L \cdot atm} \times 101.325 \, \mathrm{J/L \cdot atm} = -20.265 \, \mathrm{J}
\]

### Step 3: Match the closest option
The calculated value of \( w \) is approximately \( -20 \, \mathrm{J} \), which corresponds to option **G**.
