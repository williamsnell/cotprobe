Okay, so I have this physics problem here about water flowing over a waterfall. Hmm, I need to find the maximum temperature difference and the usable power that's going to waste. Let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, the data given: water flows at 2.5 m³/s over a waterfall 15 meters high. Density of water is 10³ kg/m³, specific heat capacity is 10³ cal/(kg·°C). I remember that when water falls, its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, and some of that energy might be lost as heat due to friction or turbulence, which would raise the temperature of the water a little.

Wait, so the maximum temperature difference would be when all the potential energy is converted into heat. But wait, no, because some energy is still kinetic at the bottom. Oh wait, no, the question says "maximum" difference, which might imply that all the potential energy loss goes into heating the water. Or wait, perhaps only some of it does.

Wait, no, the maximum temperature change would occur when all the lost potential energy is converted to heat. Because if some energy is lost elsewhere, the temperature change would be less. So to find the maximum possible ΔT, we'll assume all the potential energy goes into heating.

So first, calculate the potential energy per second, which is power. The potential energy (PE) is mgh. Mass flow rate is density times volume flow rate. So m = density * volume flow rate.

Volume flow rate is 2.5 m³/s. Density is 1e3 kg/m³. So m = 1e3 * 2.5 = 2500 kg/s.

PE per second (power) is mgh. So h is 15 m, g is 9.8 m/s².

So PE power P = 2500 kg/s * 9.8 m/s² * 15 m.

Let me calculate that. 2500 * 9.8 = 24,500. 24,500 * 15 = 367,500 watts, or 367.5 kW. Wait, but looking at the options, I see 367.5 kW as option F's power. But wait, the question says "usable power going to waste." So that's the power that's potentially available but not used. So that must be the answer for the second part.

Now, for the temperature difference. The energy going into heat is the PE loss, which is the same 367.5 kW, assuming all of it is lost as heat.

The heat Q required to change the temperature of water is Q = m * c * ΔT.

But wait, since Q is power here (energy per second), so Q = (m) * c * ΔT.

Wait, m is the mass per second, right? So m is 2500 kg/s. c is 10³ cal/(kg·°C).

Wait, but wait—what units? Let me make sure. The energy from the waterfall is in watts (joules per second), but the specific heat capacity is given in calories. So I might need to convert units.

Hmm, 1 calorie is approximately 4.184 joules. But perhaps we can work in calories for this part.

Wait, let's see: the energy per second (power) is 367500 J/s (since 367.5 kW = 367500 W = 367500 J/s).

But the specific heat is in cal, so I should convert either J to cal or vice versa.

So, 1 cal = 4.184 J. So 367500 J/s = 367500 / 4.184 cal/s ≈ ?

Let me compute that. 367500 / 4.184 ≈ Let's see, 4.184 is about 4. So 367500/4 is about 91875. But more accurately, 4.184 * 88000 ≈ 368,000. Wait, 4.184 * 88000 = 367,  88000 * 4 = 352000, 88000 * 0.184: 88000 * 0.2 is 17600, subtract 88000*0.016 (1408), so 17600-1408=16192. So total 352000 +16192=368,192. So 88000 cal/s is about 367,500 J/s. So 367500 J/s ≈ 88000 cal/s.

So Q (in cal/s) is 88000 cal/s.

Now, Q = m * c * ΔT. m is mass per second, which is 2500 kg/s. c is 1e3 cal/(kg·°C).

So rearrange for ΔT: ΔT = Q/(m*c).

Plugging in: Q is 88000 cal/s. m is 2500 kg/s. c is 1e3 cal/(kg·°C).

So ΔT = 88000 / (2500 * 1000) = 88000 / 2,500,000 = 0.0352 °C. So approximately 0.035°C.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. 2500 kg/s * 1000 cal/kg°C = 2,500,000 cal/(s·°C). The heat generated is 88,000 cal/s. So 88,000 / 2,500,000 = 0.0352, which is 0.035°C.

Looking at the options, option F is 0.035°C and 367.5 kW. So that seems to match.

Other options: option A has 0.03°C but same power. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion. Let me check that again.

Wait, 367500 J/s is 367500 W. Since 1 cal is 4.184 J, so 367500 J/s is 367500 / 4.184 ≈ 88000 calories per second. Yes, that's correct.

So 88,000 cal/s divided by (2500 kg/s * 1000 cal/kg°C) = 0.035°C.

So the temperature difference is approximately 0.035°C. The power is 367.5 kW.

Looking at the options, that's option F: 0.035°C and 367.5 kW.

But wait, let me check the options again. Option F is 0.035°C and 367.5 kW. Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be F.

To solve the problem, we calculate the potential energy of the water as it falls over the waterfall and determine how much of this energy is converted into heat, which causes a temperature rise. The potential energy per second (power) is given by:

\[
P = mgh
\]

where \( m \) is the mass flow rate, \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (\( 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)), and \( h \) is the height of the waterfall (\( 15 \, \text{m} \)). The mass flow rate is calculated as:

\[
m = \text{density} \times \text{volume flow rate} = 10^3 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \times 2.5 \, \text{m}^3/\text{s} = 2500 \, \text{kg/s}.
\]

Substituting into the power equation:

\[
P = 2500 \, \text{kg/s} \times 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \times 15 \, \text{m} = 367,500 \, \text{W} = 367.5 \, \text{kW}.
\]

This is the usable power that is going to waste.

Next, to find the maximum temperature difference (\( \Delta T \)), we assume all the potential energy is converted into heat. The heat energy per second (\( Q \)) is equal to the power:

\[
Q = 367,500 \, \text{J/s}.
\]

Using the relationship \( Q = mc\Delta T \), where \( c \) is the specific heat capacity of water (\( 10^3 \, \text{cal/(kg} \cdot \degree \text{C)} \)), we solve for \( \Delta T \):

\[
\Delta T = \frac{Q}{mc}.
\]

First, convert \( Q \) from joules to calories (\( 1 \, \text{cal} = 4.184 \, \text{J} \)):

\[
Q = \frac{367,500 \, \text{J/s}}{4.184} \approx 88,000 \, \text{cal/s}.
\]

Now substitute into the equation:

\[
\Delta T = \frac{88,000 \, \text{cal/s}}{2500 \, \text{kg/s} \times 10^3 \, \text{cal/(kg} \cdot \degree \text{C)}} = \frac{88,000}{2,500,000} = 0.0352 \, \degree \text{C}.
\]

Thus, the maximum temperature difference is approximately \( 0.035 \, \degree \text{C} \), and the usable power going to waste is \( 367.5 \, \text{kW} \). Comparing these results with the options, the correct answer is:

**F: 0.035°C and 367.5 kW.**
