Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about a noninterest-bearing note. Hmm, let me think. I remember that noninterest-bearing notes don't earn interest; instead, you buy them at a discount and get the face value when they mature. So the proceeds would be the face value minus the discount.

The note has a face value of $600 and a term of 30 days. It's dated April 5, but it's being discounted on April 15. Wait, so how many days have passed since April 5? April 5 to April 15 is 10 days. Oh, right, because April 5 is day 0, then the 6th is day 1, and so on until the 15th, which is day 10.

So the term is 30 days in total, but it's being held for 10 days before being discounted. That means the remaining term is 30 -10 = 20 days. Oh wait, wait. Or is the holding period the time from when it's issued until it's discounted? Because the note was issued on April 5, and being discounted on April 15. So the time from April 5 to April 15 is 10 days. So the remaining time until maturity is 30 -10 = 20 days. So the discount is calculated based on 20 days.

The discount rate is given as 5%. I think the formula for the discount is face value multiplied by the rate multiplied by the time. But wait, time is usually in years. So I need to convert 20 days into years. Since a year has 360 days in some financial calculations, using the 360-day year method.

So time in years is 20/360. Let me compute that: 20 divided by 360 equals 1/18, which is approximately 0.0555556 years.

The discount amount would be 600 * 5% * (20/360). Let me calculate that. 600 times 0.05 is 30. Then 30 multiplied by (20/360) is 30*(1/18)= 1.666666... So the discount is approximately $1.67.

Wait, but some people might calculate using 365 days, but I think in banking it's often 360. So I should stick with 360.

So the proceeds are face value minus discount. 600 - 1.666666... equals 598.333333... So approximately $598.33.

Looking at the options, option G is $598.33. So that should be the correct answer.

To determine the proceeds from discounting a noninterest-bearing note, we calculate the discount and subtract it from the face value. The note has a face value of $600, a term of 30 days, and is discounted on April 15 at a rate of 5%. 

1. **Time Remaining Until Maturity**: The note is dated April 5 and discounted on April 15, so 10 days have passed. The remaining term is \( 30 - 10 = 20 \) days.

2. **Convert Days to Years**: Using the 360-day year convention, the time in years is \( \frac{20}{360} = \frac{1}{18} \approx 0.0555556 \).

3. **Calculate the Discount**: The discount is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Discount} = \text{Face Value} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} = 600 \times 0.05 \times \frac{20}{360}
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 600 \times 0.05 \times \frac{1}{18} = 600 \times 0.0027778 \approx 1.67
   \]

4. **Calculate the Proceeds**: The proceeds are the face value minus the discount:
   \[
   \text{Proceeds} = 600 - 1.67 = 598.33
   \]

From the options provided, the correct answer is **G: $598.33**.
