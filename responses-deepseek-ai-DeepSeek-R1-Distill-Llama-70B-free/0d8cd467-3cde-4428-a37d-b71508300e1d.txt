Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the standard enthalpy change (ΔH0°) for the dissociation of hydrogen gas into hydrogen atoms. The reaction given is H2(g) → 2 H(g), and I'm provided with the dissociation energy D0 as 4.4781 eV. Hmm, I remember that dissociation energy is the energy required to break a bond, so this should relate to the enthalpy change.

Wait, but wait. The problem is asking for the enthalpy in kJ/mol, and the given D0 is in eV. I need to convert eV to kJ/mol somehow. I think I remember that 1 eV per molecule is equal to a certain amount in kJ per mole. Oh right, because 1 eV is the energy gained by a single electron when it moves through a potential of 1 volt. But how does that translate to per mole?

I recall that 1 eV per molecule equals approximately 96.485 kJ/mol. Oh wait, because 1 eV = 1.60218e-19 J, and then multiply by Avogadro's number to get per mole. So let me calculate that.

Let me see: 1 eV = 1.60218e-19 J. So per mole, that's 1.60218e-19 J * 6.02214e23 mol^-1. Let me compute that. 1.60218e-19 * 6.02214e23 = approximately (1.60218 * 6.02214) * 1e4. Because 1e-19 * 1e23 is 1e4.

Calculating 1.60218 * 6.02214: 1.6 * 6 is 9.6, but more accurately: 1.60218 * 6.02214 ≈ 9.6485. So 9.6485 * 1e4 J/mol = 96485 J/mol. Converting that to kJ, divide by 1000, so 96.485 kJ/mol. Okay, so 1 eV per molecule is 96.485 kJ/mol.

Wait, but wait a second. Because D0 is given as 4.4781 eV, but for each H2 molecule. So when H2 breaks into 2 H atoms, each bond dissociation requires energy. So the dissociation energy D0 is the energy per mole of bonds broken. So for each mole of H2, we get 2 moles of H atoms, meaning one mole of bonds is broken. So the energy required should be D0 multiplied by 96.485 kJ/mol per eV.

So the calculation would be 4.4781 eV * 96.485 kJ/(mol·eV). Let me compute that.

4.4781 * 96.485. Let me break this down. 4 * 96 is 384. 0.4781 * 96.485 is approximately: 0.4 *96 is 38.4, plus 0.0781 *96 ≈ 7.5. So 38.4 +7.5 is 45.9. So total is 384 + 45.9 = 429.9. Wait, wait, wait, but I'm not sure. Let me do a more accurate calculation.

Or perhaps use exact multiplication:

4.4781 * 96.485.

Let me compute 4 * 96.485 = 385.94.

0.4781 * 96.485. Let's compute 0.4 *96.485 =38.594. 0.07 *96.485=6.75395. 0.0081 *96.485≈0.780. So adding those: 38.594 +6.754=45.348 +0.780=46.128.

So total is 385.94 +46.128 = 432.068 kJ/mol.

Looking at the options, option H is 432.07 kJ/mol. But wait, is ΔH0° positive or negative here?

Wait, the reaction is H2(g) → 2 H(g). Since this is an endothermic process (breaking bonds requires energy), the ΔH should be positive. So the value we've calculated is positive, which makes sense.

Wait, but wait another thing. Oh! Because D0 is the bond dissociation energy, which is the energy required to break the bond. So yes, the enthalpy change is positive.

So the correct answer should be around 432.07 kJ/mol, which is option H.

To determine the standard enthalpy change (ΔH0°) for the reaction $\mathrm{H}_2(g) \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{H}(g)$, we start with the given dissociation energy $D_0 = 4.4781 \, \mathrm{eV}$. This represents the energy required to break one mole of $\mathrm{H}_2$ bonds. Since the reaction involves breaking one mole of $\mathrm{H}_2$ bonds to produce two moles of hydrogen atoms, the dissociation energy directly corresponds to the enthalpy change for the reaction.

To convert $D_0$ from $\mathrm{eV}$ to $\mathrm{kJ/mol}$, we use the conversion factor $1 \, \mathrm{eV} = 96.485 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}$. Thus, the calculation is:

\[
\Delta H_0^\circ = D_0 \times 96.485 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol} = 4.4781 \, \mathrm{eV} \times 96.485 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol \cdot eV}.
\]

Breaking this down:

1. $4 \times 96.485 = 385.94 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}$.
2. $0.4781 \times 96.485 \approx 46.128 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}$.
3. Adding these gives $\Delta H_0^\circ = 385.94 + 46.128 = 432.068 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}$.

Rounding to two decimal places, $\Delta H_0^\circ = 432.07 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}$. Since the reaction is endothermic (energy is required to break bonds), the enthalpy change is positive.

From the given options, the closest match is **432.07 kJ/mol**, which corresponds to option **H**.
