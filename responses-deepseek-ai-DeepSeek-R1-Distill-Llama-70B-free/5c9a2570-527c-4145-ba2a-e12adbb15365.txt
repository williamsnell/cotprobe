Alright, so I have this question about graph theory, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is asking for the maximum number of edges in a simple planar graph with 30 vertices. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, okay. I remember that planar graphs have some specific rules about their edges and vertices. Oh right, there's this formula or inequality related to planar graphs. I think it's something like the maximum number of edges is 3n - 6, where n is the number of vertices. But wait, is that correct?

Let me think. I recall that for a simple planar graph (which means no loops or multiple edges), the maximum number of edges without any crossings is given by Euler's formula. Euler's formula is V - E + F = 2, where V is vertices, E edges, F faces. But how does that help me find the maximum edges?

Oh right, there's another inequality related to planar graphs. It's that for a planar graph, the number of edges E must satisfy E ≤ 3V - 6. So if I have 30 vertices, plugging that in, E ≤ 3*30 -6 = 90 -6 = 84. So the maximum number of edges should be 84. Looking at the options, that's option B.

Wait, but wait a second. I should make sure I'm not mixing this up. Let me think again. Ok, the formula E ≤ 3V - 6 applies to connected planar graphs. Does the question specify if the graph is connected? The question doesn't say, it just says a simple planar graph. Oh, right, even if it's disconnected, the same formula applies because adding edges in a disconnected graph still follows the same maximum.

So for n=30, E_max = 3*30 -6 =84. So the answer must be B.

I should double-check if I'm not missing any other condition. Like, are there cases where the maximum edges could be higher? Well, planar graphs cannot have more than 3n-6 edges because any more would force the graph to be non-planar. So 84 is definitely the maximum here.

The maximum number of edges in a simple planar graph with \( n \) vertices is given by the formula \( E \leq 3n - 6 \). For \( n = 30 \), substituting into the formula gives:

\[
E \leq 3(30) - 6 = 90 - 6 = 84
\]

This formula applies to both connected and disconnected simple planar graphs, as adding edges in a disconnected graph still adheres to the same maximum limit. Therefore, the maximum number of edges in a simple planar graph with 30 vertices is 84.

The correct answer is **B**.

B
