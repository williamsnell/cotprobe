Okay, let's try to figure out this tax problem step by step. So, Lucy Johnson earns $26,300 a year, and she supports her disabled husband and three children. Her husband earns $3,200 from some work he does at home. They have itemized deductions of $3,100 for the year. We need to find their federal income tax.

First, I remember that to calculate federal income tax, we need to determine their total income, subtract deductions and exemptions, and then apply the tax brackets. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps, so I'll try to break it down.

Total Income: Lucy's income is $26,300 and her husband's is $3,200. So combined, that's $26,300 + $3,200 = $29,500.

Next, I think about the standard deduction versus itemized deductions. The question says they have itemized deductions of $3,100. So I should use that instead of the standard deduction. Wait, but what's the standard deduction for a married couple filing jointly? I think for recent years, it's around $25,900 for 2023. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me think. Oh right, the standard deduction for 2022 was $25,900 for married filing jointly. But if their itemized deductions are $3,100, which is less than the standard deduction, why would they itemize? Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Oh, wait, no, the standard deduction is higher, so they should take the standard deduction unless their itemized is higher. In this case, their itemized is $3,100, which is way lower than $25,900, so they would take the standard deduction. Hmm, but the question says they have itemized deductions of $3,100. Does that mean they're choosing to itemize? Or is that their total possible itemized deductions, but they might still take the standard if it's higher?

Wait, I might have made a mistake. Let me check. The standard deduction is more than their itemized, so they would take the standard deduction of $25,900. So their total deductions would be $25,900, not $3,100. That changes things.

Wait, no, wait. The question says they have itemized deductions amounting to $3,100. So does that mean they are itemizing, or are they just stating their possible itemized deductions? Because if the standard is higher, it's better to take the standard. But the question might be simplifying things, so perhaps we should use the $3,100 as their total deductions. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

But maybe the question is structured so that we should use the itemized deductions provided, regardless of the standard deduction. So perhaps we proceed with $3,100 as their deductions.

Wait, but let's clarify. In the US tax system, you can choose between the standard deduction and itemizing. If your itemized deductions are less than the standard, you take the standard. So in this case, their itemized is $3,100, which is less than $25,900, so they would take the standard deduction. So their total deductions would be $25,900.

But I'm not 100% sure if that's correct, because the question says they have itemized deductions of $3,100. Maybe the question is implying that they are itemizing and using that amount, perhaps because they are using an older tax year where the standard deduction was lower. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed to ignore the standard deduction and just use the itemized deductions given. So I'll proceed with the $3,100 as their total deductions.

Next, I think about exemptions or personal deductions. Wait, I remember that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) eliminated personal exemptions from 2018 to 2025. So each person can't claim a personal exemption anymore. So the only deductions would be the standard or itemized deductions.

So, the total income is $29,500. Then, subtract the deductions. If we're using the standard deduction of $25,900, then the taxable income would be $29,500 - $25,900 = $3,600. If we're using the itemized $3,100, then taxable income is $29,500 - $3,100 = $26,400.

Wait, but if their itemized is lower than the standard, they should take the standard, so taxable income would be $29,500 - $25,900 = $3,600.

But then, what's the tax on $3,600? Let me think about the tax brackets. For married filing jointly in 2022, the brackets are:

- 10% on the first $20,550.

Wait, no, I think the brackets are:

10%: $0 - $20,550

12%: $20,551 - $83,550

So, if taxable income is $3,600, that's in the 10% bracket. So the tax would be 10% of $3,600, which is $360.

Wait, but that's a very low tax. Looking at the options, I don't see $360. The options are A: $5,228, B: $0, C: $2,650, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the standard deduction. Let's think again.

If the Johnsons have four dependents: Lucy, her husband, and three children. Wait, no, dependents are people they support. Wait, Lucy is the primary earner, and she supports her husband and three children. So that's four people in the household, but for tax purposes, the number of dependents is the husband and three children, so four dependents. But as I thought earlier, personal exemptions are eliminated, so they don't get to deduct for each dependent anymore.

Wait, but the standard deduction is higher than their itemized deductions, so their taxable income would be $29,500 - $25,900 = $3,600. Tax on that would be 10% of $3,600 = $360. But none of the options match $360. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should use the itemized deductions of $3,100 instead. Let's try that.

Total income: $29,500. Subtract itemized deductions: $29,500 - $3,100 = $26,400 taxable income.

Now, applying the tax brackets. The 2022 brackets for married filing jointly are:

- 10% on the first $20,550.

- 12% on income between $20,551 and $83,550.

So, the first $20,550 is taxed at 10%, which is $2,055.

The remaining $26,400 - $20,550 = $5,850 is taxed at 12%, so 12% of $5,850 is $702.

Total tax would be $2,055 + $702 = $2,757.

But looking at the options, the closest is option C: $2,650, but that's not exact. Hmm, maybe the tax brackets are different.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong tax brackets. Let me double-check the 2022 tax brackets for married filing jointly.

Wait, I think the 10% bracket is up to $20,550.

12% starts at $20,551 up to $83,550.

So, the calculation seems correct. $2,055 + $702 = $2,757. But none of the options match exactly. The closest is option C: $2,650, but that's $107 less.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the income calculation. Let me double-check.

Lucy earns $26,300, husband earns $3,200. Total is $29,500.

Deductions: if standard is $25,900, taxable income is $3,600. Tax is 10% of that, $360. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, if using itemized deductions of $3,100, taxable income is $26,400, tax as calculated is $2,757, but that's not an option either.

Wait, the options don't include $2,757. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: $5,228

B: $0

C: $2,650

D: $7,150

E: $6,300

F: $4,380

G: $3,400

H: $22,650

I: $3,950

J: $1,850

So, the closest is C: $2,650, but it's $107 less than my calculation. Maybe I made a mistake in the brackets.

Wait, perhaps the brackets are different. Let me check the exact 2022 tax table.

Wait, the 2022 tax brackets for married filing jointly are as follows:

- 10% on the first $20,550.

- 12% on $20,551 to $83,550.

So, for $26,400 taxable income:

$20,550 * 10% = $2,055.

$26,400 - $20,550 = $5,850.

$5,850 * 12% = $702.

Total tax: $2,055 + $702 = $2,757.

Hmm. So that's the correct calculation, but it's not matching any of the options. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption about the deductions.

Wait, maybe I should have used the standard deduction instead of the itemized. Let me try that.

If standard deduction is $25,900, then taxable income is $29,500 - $25,900 = $3,600.

Tax on $3,600 is 10% of $3,600 = $360.

But none of the options is $360, except maybe option B: $0. But why would it be zero? Because maybe they fall below the tax threshold.

Wait, the standard deduction is $25,900, so if their income is $29,500, their taxable income is $3,600. The tax would be $360, which is more than zero, so option B is not correct.

Wait, but perhaps they have more dependents. Wait, the number of dependents affects the taxable income. But with the TCJA, personal exemptions are gone, so dependents don't reduce taxable income anymore. But there's the Child Tax Credit. Let me think.

The Child Tax Credit is up to $2,000 per child, but it's non-refundable and starts to phase out at certain income levels. For married filing jointly, the phase-out starts at $400,000, which is way higher than their income, so they should qualify.

They have three children, so the Child Tax Credit would be 3 * $2,000 = $6,000.

So their total tax would be $2,757 (from earlier), but then subtract the Child Tax Credit of $6,000. But that would result in a negative tax, which would mean they get a refund, but their tax liability can't be negative. So their federal income tax would be $0, because the credit exceeds the tax.

Wait, that's possible. So let me recalculate with that in mind.

Taxable income is $26,400 (using itemized deductions), leading to a tax of $2,757. Then, subtract the Child Tax Credit of $6,000. So $2,757 - $6,000 = -$3,243. Since the tax can't be negative, their tax liability would be $0. So their federal income tax is $0.

Looking at the options, option B is $0 because they fall below the tax threshold. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought they had a tax liability of $2,757, but with the Child Tax Credit, it brings it down to $0. So the correct answer would be option B.

But wait, I didn't consider the Child Tax Credit in my initial calculation. So perhaps that's the key point I missed.

So, to sum up:

Gross Income: $29,500

Itemized Deductions: $3,100 (but since standard is higher, they take $25,900)

Taxable Income: $3,600

Tax Liability: $360

Child Tax Credit: $6,000 (3 children * $2,000)

Tax Liability after credit: $360 - $6,000 = negative, so $0.

Therefore, their federal income tax is $0, option B.
</think>

To determine the Johnsons' federal income tax, we start by calculating their total income and deductions. Lucy earns $26,300, and her husband earns $3,200, for a combined total income of $29,500. The question states they have itemized deductions of $3,100, but the standard deduction for married filing jointly in 2022 is $25,900, which is higher than their itemized deductions. Therefore, they would take the standard deduction of $25,900.

Subtracting the standard deduction from their total income gives a taxable income of:

\[
\$29,500 - \$25,900 = \$3,600
\]

Next, we apply the 2022 federal income tax brackets for married filing jointly. The first $20,550 is taxed at 10%, and any amount above that is taxed at 12%. Since their taxable income is $3,600, it falls entirely within the 10% bracket. The tax liability is:

\[
\$3,600 \times 10\% = \$360
\]

However, the Johnsons are eligible for the Child Tax Credit, which provides up to $2,000 per child for up to three children. With three children, their total Child Tax Credit is:

\[
3 \times \$2,000 = \$6,000
\]

The Child Tax Credit is non-refundable, meaning it reduces their tax liability dollar-for-dollar. Subtracting the credit from their tax liability:

\[
\$360 - \$6,000 = -\$3,640
\]

Since the tax liability cannot be negative, the Johnsons' federal income tax is reduced to $0.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**B: $0 (because they fall below the tax threshold)**
