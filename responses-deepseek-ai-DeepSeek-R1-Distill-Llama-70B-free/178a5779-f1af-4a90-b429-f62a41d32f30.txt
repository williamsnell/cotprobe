Okay, I need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 252 and 96. Hmm, I remember that the GCF is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. So, how do I approach this?

Well, one method I know is listing out all the factors of each number and then finding the largest one they have in common. But that might take a while, especially since these numbers are a bit large. Maybe there's a more efficient way.

Oh right, the Euclidean algorithm! That's supposed to be a quicker method for finding the GCF. I think it involves dividing the larger number by the smaller one and then using the remainder to continue the process.

So, let me try that. First, divide 252 by 96. Let's see, 96 times 2 is 192, and 252 minus 192 is 60. So the remainder is 60. Now, I take the previous divisor, which was 96, and divide it by this remainder.

So 96 divided by 60. 60 times 1 is 60, subtracting that from 96 gives a remainder of 36. Now, I take the last non-zero remainder, which was 60, and divide it by 36.

60 divided by 36 is 1, with a remainder of 24. Continuing, I now take 36 and divide it by 24. 24 times 1 is 24, subtracting leaves 12 as the remainder.

Now, divide 24 by 12. That divides exactly 2 times with no remainder. Since the remainder is zero, the last non-zero remainder is 12. So the GCF should be 12.

Wait, but let me double-check using another method to be sure. Maybe prime factorization.

Let's break down both numbers into their prime factors.

Starting with 252: I know 252 divided by 2 is 126. 126 divided by 2 is 63. Then 63 divided by 3 is 21. 21 divided by 3 is 7, and 7 is a prime. So the prime factors of 252 are 2^2 * 3^2 * 7^1.

Now 96: 96 divided by 2 is 48. 48/2=24, 24/2=12, 12/2=6, 6/2=3. So that's five 2s and one 3. So 96 is 2^5 * 3^1.

The GCF is the product of the lowest powers of the common primes. So for 2, the lower power is 2^2 (from 252) and for 3 it's 3^1. So 2^2 *3 =4*3=12.

Okay, so both methods give me 12. So the GCF is 12.

The greatest common factor of 252 and 96 is determined using the Euclidean algorithm and confirmed by prime factorization. Both methods yield the same result: 12.
