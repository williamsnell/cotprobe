Okay, so I've got this problem here about computing the size of a steel rectangular column. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on column design, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the column is hinged at both ends, which I think means it's a simply supported column. The length is 16 inches, and the compressive load is 15,000 lbs. Oh wait, but there's a factor of safety of 2.5. So I guess I need to consider that when calculating the allowable stress.

The elastic limit of the material is 40,000 psi. Modulus of elasticity is 30e6 psi. Oh right, modulus is E, which is important for finding the critical stress. Also, the breadth is three times the thickness, so if I let thickness be t, then breadth b is 3t.

Wait, the formula for critical load for a column with hinged ends is P_cr = (π² * E * I) / (L²), right? Where I is the moment of inertia. But since it's rectangular, I for a rectangle is (b * t³)/12. Or wait, no, I think the moment of inertia for a rectangle about its neutral axis is (b*t³)/12 when bending about the minor axis, but the major axis would be (t*b³)/12. Oh wait, no, that's for different axes. Wait, maybe I should think about which direction is being considered. Oh wait, the critical stress is about the axis that allows for the smallest moment of inertia, so the column will fail along the weaker axis. So for a rectangle, the weaker axis is the one with the smaller dimension. So if the column's cross-section is a rectangle with b = 3t, then the thickness t is the smaller dimension.

So the moment of inertia I for bending about the t axis (the weaker axis) would be (b * t³)/12. Since b is 3t, substituting that in, I would be (3t * t³)/12 = (3 t^4)/12 = t^4/4.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me write down the formula for critical load again. P_cr = (π² * E * I) / (L²). So I can rearrange this to solve for the allowable load. But wait, the actual load applied is 15,000 lbs, but we have to apply a factor of safety. So the allowable load P_allow is P_applied / FOS. So P_allow = 15000 / 2.5 = 6000 lbs.

Wait, no, wait. The factor of safety is applied to the ultimate strength, right? Or is it applied to the stress? Hmm. Wait, let me think. The factor of safety (FOS) is the ratio of the elastic limit to the allowable stress. So allowable stress σ_allow = σ_elastic_limit / FOS. So σ_allow = 40000 psi / 2.5 = 16000 psi.

Wait, but for column design, when the critical stress is less than the elastic limit, we can use the Euler formula. Otherwise, we have to consider other formulas like the Johnson formula or something else. Because if the stress exceeds the elastic limit, the behavior becomes inelastic and Euler's formula doesn't apply anymore.

So the first step is to determine whether the critical stress is above or below the elastic limit. If the applied load would cause the critical stress to be above the elastic limit, then we have to use a different approach. But let's see.

Wait, but in this problem, the column is under a compressive load, so we have to check both the crushing strength and the buckling (Euler) stress.

Alternatively, I can compute the allowable stress, σ_allow = 40,000 / 2.5 = 16,000 psi.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute the maximum allowable stress as the minimum between the allowable stress based on yielding and the allowable stress based on Euler's critical stress.

Wait, but let me think again. The approach is:

1. Calculate the allowable stress based on the elastic limit divided by the factor of safety. So σ_allow_yielding = 40000 / 2.5 = 16000 psi.

2. Calculate the Euler critical stress for the column. If the Euler stress is less than σ_allow_yielding, then the column will fail by buckling, and the allowable load is determined by Euler's formula. Otherwise, the failure is by yielding, and the allowable load is determined by the yield stress.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Wait, the critical stress σ_crit is (P_cr)/(A). So if σ_crit is greater than the elastic limit, then Euler's formula doesn't apply because the material will yield before the critical load is reached.

Wait, no. If the critical stress is less than the elastic limit, then Euler's formula applies. If the critical stress is higher, then the column will fail by yielding before it can buckle, so the allowable stress is determined by the yield stress.

So the approach is:

- Compute the allowable stress σ_allow = min(σ_elastic_limit / FOS, σ_crit)

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the actual stress in the column due to the load is σ = P / A. So if σ exceeds σ_crit, then Euler's formula says it will buckle. But if σ exceeds σ_elastic_limit, then the material yields.

So the allowable load is the minimum between the load that causes σ_crit and the load that causes σ_allow_yielding.

Wait, perhaps it's better to first compute the maximum allowable load based on Euler's formula and then based on yielding, and take the smaller one.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me try to outline the steps.

Given:

- Column length L = 16 in.

- Compressive load P = 15,000 lbs.

- Factor of safety FOS = 2.5.

- Elastic limit σ_elastic = 40,000 psi.

- Modulus E = 30e6 psi.

- Breadth b = 3 * thickness t.

We need to find the dimensions (b and t) such that the column can support the load without failing, considering both yielding and buckling.

First, I should probably determine the allowable stress. But wait, since it's a column, the failure can occur either by yielding or by buckling, whichever comes first.

So, the maximum allowable stress is the minimum of the stress that would cause yielding (σ_allow_yield = σ_elastic / FOS) and the Euler critical stress (σ_crit = (π² E) / (L²/r)^2), where r is the radius of gyration.

Wait, but I think the correct formula for Euler's critical stress is σ_crit = (π² E) / (L/r)^2, where L is the effective length (which for hinged ends is L, so the effective length factor is 1). So for a rectangular cross-section, r is the radius of gyration. For a rectangle, the radius of gyration about the minor axis is (t/√12) if t is the smaller dimension.

Wait, let me clarify. The radius of gyration r for a rectangular section about the minor axis is r = t/(√12), because for a rectangle, the moment of inertia I = (b t^3)/12. The radius of gyration is sqrt(I/A), where A is the area. So I = (b t^3)/12, and A = b t. So r^2 = I/A = (b t^3)/(12 b t) )= t²/12. So r = t/(2*sqrt(3)).

So, r = t/(2√3).

Now, the critical stress σ_crit is (π² E) / ( (L/(r))² )

Plugging in r, we get σ_crit = (π² E) / ( (L * 2√3 / t )² ) = (π² E t²) / ( (L * 2√3 )² )

So, σ_crit = (π² E t² ) / ( ( 16 * 3 ) L² )

Wait, let's compute the denominator: (L * 2√3 / t ) squared is ( 2√3 L / t )² = (4 * 3 L²) / t² ) = 12 L² / t².

So, σ_crit = (π² E t² ) / (12 L² )

Wait, so σ_crit = (π² E t² ) / (12 L² )

Now, the actual stress in the column due to the load is σ = P / A. Since P is 15,000 lbs, and A is b * t = 3t * t = 3 t².

So σ = 15000 / (3 t²) = 5000 / t² psi.

But wait, we have to apply the factor of safety, so the allowable stress σ_allow is 40000 / 2.5 = 16000 psi.

Wait, but this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to set up the equations.

The column must satisfy both the yielding and the buckling criteria.

So, the stress due to the load (σ) must be less than σ_allow_yielding, which is 16000 psi.

So, σ = P / A = 15000 / (3 t²) = 5000 / t² <= 16000.

So, 5000 / t² <= 16000 => t² >= 5000 / 16000 => t² >= 0.3125 => t >= sqrt(0.3125) ≈ 0.559 in.

So the thickness must be at least about 0.559 inches.

But we also need to check the Euler's critical stress.

The critical stress σ_crit must be greater than the allowable stress, otherwise the column will buckle.

Wait, no. The allowable stress for buckling is σ_crit. So σ must be less than σ_crit.

Wait, but σ_crit is the stress at which buckling occurs. So the actual stress must be less than σ_crit.

So, σ = 5000 / t² must be <= σ_crit.

But σ_crit is given by (π² E t² ) / (12 L² )

So, 5000 / t² <= (π² E t² ) / (12 L² )

Let me plug in the numbers.

E is 30e6 psi, L is 16 inches.

So,

5000 / t² <= (π² * 30e6 * t² ) / (12 * 16² )

Compute the right side:

First, compute denominator: 12 * 256 = 3072.

So, (π² * 30e6 * t² ) / 3072.

Compute π² ≈ 9.8696.

So, 9.8696 * 30e6 = 296,088,000.

Divide by 3072: 296,088,000 / 3072 ≈ let's compute that.

Well, 3072 * 96,000 = 3072 * 1e5 = 307200000, which is larger than 296,088,000.

Wait, alternatively, 3072 * 96,000 = 3072 * 100,000 = 307,200,000, minus 3072 * 4,000 = 12,288,000, so 307,200,000 - 12,288,000 = 294,912,000.

So 3072 * 96,000 = 294,912,000. Our numerator is 296,088,000.

So 296,088,000 / 3072 = approx 96,333.33.

So, the right side becomes approximately 96,333.33 * t².

So, the inequality is:

5000 / t² <= 96,333.33 * t²

Multiply both sides by t²:

5000 <= 96,333.33 * t^4

Then, t^4 >= 5000 / 96333.33 ≈ 0.0519.

So, t^4 >= ~0.0519.

Take fourth root: t >= (0.0519)^(1/4).

Compute 0.0519^(1/4):

Well, sqrt(0.0519) is about 0.228, then sqrt again gives about 0.477 inches.

So t must be at least approximately 0.477 inches.

Wait, but earlier from the yielding condition, t was at least ~0.559 inches. So the yielding condition is more restrictive. So the thickness must be at least ~0.559 inches.

Wait, but that's not considering the factor of safety in the Euler's equation. Hmm, because I'm not sure if I applied the factor of safety correctly. Let me think again.

Wait, the σ_allow is 16000 psi, which is from the elastic limit divided by FOS. So in the Euler equation, perhaps I should use σ_crit = (π² E) / ( (L/r)^2 ), and then set σ_crit >= σ_allow.

Wait, maybe I should set σ_crit >= σ_allow, so that the column doesn't buckle.

Wait, no. Because σ_crit is the stress at which buckling occurs. So the actual stress σ must be less than σ_crit for the column to not buckle.

Wait, but in our case, with the applied load, σ is 5000 / t². So we need 5000 / t² <= σ_crit.

But σ_crit is (π² E t² ) / (12 L² )

So,

5000 / t² <= (π² E t² ) / (12 L² )

Multiply both sides by t²:

5000 <= (π² E t^4 ) / (12 L² )

Rearranged:

t^4 >= (5000 * 12 L² ) / (π² E )

Plugging in the numbers:

5000 * 12 = 60,000.

L is 16 in., so L² = 256.

E is 30e6 psi.

So,

t^4 >= (60,000 * 256) / (π² * 30e6 )

Compute numerator: 60,000 * 256 = 15,360,000.

Denominator: π² ≈ 9.8696, so 9.8696 * 30e6 ≈ 296,088,000.

So,

t^4 >= 15,360,000 / 296,088,000 ≈ 0.0519.

So t^4 >= 0.0519, so t >= (0.0519)^(1/4) ≈ 0.477 inches.

But from the yielding condition, t >= ~0.559 inches.

So the yielding condition is more restrictive. So the thickness must be at least 0.559 inches. But let's see what the options are.

Looking at the options, the thicknesses are 0.6, 0.65, 0.75, etc.

So perhaps the minimum t is around 0.6 inches.

Wait, let's compute it more accurately.

t^4 = 0.0519 → t ≈ (0.0519)^(0.25).

Compute 0.0519^(0.25):

0.0519 = 5.19e-2.

Let me compute ln(0.0519) = ln(5.19e-2) ≈ ln(0.0519) ≈ -2.975.

Divide by 4: -0.74375. Exponentiate: e^(-0.74375) ≈ 0.476.

So t ≈ 0.476 inches. So about 0.476 inches.

But the yielding condition gives t ≈ 0.559 inches. So the thickness must satisfy both, but the yielding is more restrictive, so t must be at least 0.559 inches.

So let's compute the required t to satisfy the yielding condition.

From σ = 5000 / t² <= 16000.

So t² >= 5000 / 16000 = 0.3125 → t >= sqrt(0.3125) ≈ 0.559 inches.

So t must be at least 0.559 inches.

Now, let's see the options. The options list the dimensions as (breadth x thickness). Since breadth b = 3t.

Looking at the options:

Option B: 1.8 x 0.6 → t=0.6, b=1.8. So 1.8=3*0.6 → yes.

Option F: 2 x 0.6 → same t.

Option D: 1.75 x 0.65 → t=0.65.

Option A: 2.5 x 0.75 → t=0.75.

Option C: 2.25 x 0.8 → t=0.8.

Option H: 2.25 x 0.75 → t=0.75.

Option I: 2.5 x 0.8 → t=0.8.

Option E: 3 x 1 → t=1.

So possible ts are 0.6, 0.65, 0.75, 0.8, etc.

We need t >= 0.559, so t=0.6 is acceptable.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check.

Wait, the allowable stress is 16,000 psi. So the stress from the load is 15,000/(3t²) = 5000/t².

Set 5000/t² = 16,000 → t² = 5000/16000 = 0.3125 → t=0.559 in.

So the minimum t is 0.559 in, which we can round up to 0.6 inches.

So with t=0.6 inches, b=3*0.6=1.8 inches. So the dimensions would be 1.8 x 0.6, which is option B.

Wait, but what about the Euler condition? Let me check if with t=0.6 inches, the stress is within the Euler critical stress.

Compute σ_crit = (π² E t²) / (12 L² )

E=30e6 psi, t=0.6, L=16.

So,

σ_crit = (9.8696 * 30e6 * 0.6²) / (12 * 16² )

Compute numerator: 9.8696 * 30e6 = 296,088,000.

0.6²=0.36. So 296,088,000 * 0.36 = 106,591,680.

Denominator: 12 * 256 = 3072.

So σ_crit = 106,591,680 / 3072 ≈ let's compute that.

Divide numerator and denominator by 1000: 106,591.68 / 3.072 ≈ approx.

3.072 * 34,700 = 3.072 * 30,000=92,160; 3.072*4700=14,416.4 → total ~106,576.4
