Question:

Two cars were driving within the legal speed limit as they approached an intersection. There are no traffic lights, stop signs, or warnings posted at this intersection. Both vehicles entered the intersection simultaneously and collided. In the accident, one of the drivers suffered a broken pelvis and internal injuries. Although the other driver's truck was slightly damaged, he did not suffer any physical injuries. Thereafter, the injured driver sued the city for negligence, claiming that the city failed to provide adequate warning at the intersection, which she contended was particularly dangerous and heavily traveled. At trial, the city attorney offers evidence that the intersection has been the same for 14 years, and no other accidents have occurred during that time. Upon objection by the injured driver's attorney, this evidence should be

Options:

A: excluded, because it is improper negative evidence.
B: admitted as relevant evidence of a fact of consequence to the action.
C: admitted, as it is critical for the jury to understand the history of the intersection.
D: excluded, because the dangers of unfair prejudice and confusion of the issues may tend to mislead the jury.
E: admitted, but only if the city can prove that there have been no significant changes in traffic patterns in the last 14 years.
F: excluded, because it can potentially bias the jury against the injured driver.
G: excluded, because it is irrelevant to the current accident.
H: admitted, as it shows the city's negligence in maintaining the intersection.
I: excluded, as it is not directly related to the case at hand.
J: admitted, provided that the jury is instructed about the danger of inferential negative evidence.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with negligence and what evidence is admissible. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is about two cars entering an intersection without any traffic lights or signs, and they collide. One driver is injured and sues the city for negligence, claiming the city didn't provide adequate warnings, making the intersection dangerous. The city's attorney offers evidence that the intersection has been the same for 14 years with no other accidents. The injured driver's attorney objects, and the question is whether this evidence should be admitted or excluded, and why.

I remember that in evidence law, there's a concept about the admissibility of evidence showing that an event (like an accident) hasn't happened before. I think it's related to the idea of proving or disproving negligence. So, when a plaintiff claims that a condition is dangerous, the defendant might want to show that no one else has been hurt there before. But wait, isn't there a rule about how prior accidents or lack thereof can be used?

I think the general rule is that evidence of the absence of prior accidents is inadmissible because it's considered negative evidence. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the specifics. Let me recall. I think it's covered under Federal Rule of Evidence 401, which deals with relevance. For evidence to be relevant, it must have a tendency to make a fact of consequence more or less probable than it would be without the evidence.

So, the city is trying to show that because there were no prior accidents in 14 years, the intersection isn't dangerous, so they weren't negligent in maintaining it. But the problem with that is that the absence of prior accidents doesn't necessarily prove that the condition isn't dangerous. It could just mean that no one happened to be in an accident there before, not that it's safe.

Wait, but I think there's an exception when the evidence is being offered to show the lack of a defect or hazard. Or maybe it's about whether the condition is a dangerous one. So, if the plaintiff is arguing that the intersection is inherently dangerous because of its design, the defendant could offer evidence that others have used it without incident. But I'm not sure if that's allowed.

I remember reading that evidence showing that an accident hasn't happened before is generally not admissible because it's improper negative evidence. The idea is that just because something didn't happen before doesn't mean it's not dangerous. So, if the city offers evidence that there were no other accidents, that's probably inadmissible because it's trying to use negative evidence to show the intersection wasn't dangerous, which isn't a proper use.

Looking at the options, option A says it's excluded because it's improper negative evidence. Option G says it's irrelevant to the current accident. Option E talks about traffic patterns changing. Option J mentions jury instructions about inferential negative evidence.

Wait, but I also remember that sometimes such evidence can be relevant if it's about the existence of a defect. Like, if the plaintiff claims a certain condition caused the accident, the defendant can present evidence that the same condition has been present for a long time without causing other accidents. But I think that's only allowed if it's about the same condition and whether it's a defect. But in this case, the argument is about the need for a warning. So the city is arguing that since there were no prior accidents, the intersection wasn't so dangerous that a warning was needed.

Hmm. So, the evidence is being offered to show that the city wasn't negligent because the intersection wasn't dangerous, as evidenced by no prior accidents. But is that a valid use? I think courts have held that such evidence is inadmissible because the fact that no one else was injured doesn't necessarily mean the condition isn't dangerous. It could just be that no one else encountered the dangerous condition in a way that led to an accident before.

So, the evidence might be considered irrelevant or improper negative evidence. Therefore, it should be excluded. Looking at the options, option A says it's excluded because it's improper negative evidence. Option G says it's irrelevant.

Wait, but under FRE 402, evidence is irrelevant if it doesn't have a tendency to make a fact of consequence more or less probable. So, does the lack of prior accidents make it less probable that the intersection was dangerous? Or is that not a proper inference?

I think the key point is that the absence of prior accidents isn't reliable evidence that the place isn't dangerous. So the evidence is irrelevant and should be excluded. Alternatively, it's improper negative evidence.

Wait, but some sources say that while evidence of prior accidents might be admissible to show a dangerous condition, the absence of prior accidents is generally not admissible to show the opposite. So, the city's evidence is trying to use negative evidence, which is usually excluded.

So, looking back at the options, the correct answer would be either A or G. Option A says it's excluded as improper negative evidence. Option G says it's irrelevant.

Wait, but in some cases, courts have allowed such evidence if it's relevant to a fact at issue. For example, if the plaintiff is claiming the intersection is dangerous, the defendant might offer evidence that others have used it without issue. But I think that's more about the condition not being a defect rather than just the absence of accidents.

Alternatively, I think the general rule is that evidence of the absence of prior accidents is inadmissible because it's considered negative evidence that doesn't prove anything about the dangerousness of the intersection. So, the evidence should be excluded as improper negative evidence, which would make option A correct.

But wait, another angle: the city is trying to show that the intersection wasn't dangerous, which is a fact of consequence. So, if the lack of prior accidents is relevant to that, then it would be admissible. But I'm pretty sure that such evidence is not admissible because it's not reliable. So, it's excluded, making option A correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I remember that sometimes evidence of similar past events can be used, but the absence isn't. So, I think the answer is A: excluded, because it's improper negative evidence.

The question revolves around the admissibility of evidence in a negligence case where the defendant (the city) seeks to introduce evidence that an intersection has remained unchanged for 14 years without any prior accidents. The plaintiff alleges that the city was negligent in failing to provide adequate warnings at the intersection, which she claims is dangerous. The key issue is whether the absence of prior accidents is admissible to rebut the claim of dangerousness.

Under evidence law, the general rule is that evidence of the absence of prior accidents is typically inadmissible because it constitutes improper negative evidence. Such evidence does not reliably prove that a condition is not dangerous, as the absence of accidents could be due to various factors unrelated to the inherent safety of the condition. Courts have consistently held that this type of evidence is irrelevant or misleading because it does not tend to make a fact of consequence (e.g., whether the intersection was dangerous) more or less probable.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Correct. The evidence is excluded because it is improper negative evidence. This aligns with the principle that the absence of prior accidents does not reliably prove the absence of danger.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. While the evidence may seem irrelevant, the better reasoning is that it is excluded specifically as improper negative evidence, not merely because it is irrelevant.
- Other options (e.g., B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J) are incorrect because they either mischaracterize the evidence or fail to apply the appropriate legal principle.

Thus, the correct answer is that the evidence should be excluded as improper negative evidence.
