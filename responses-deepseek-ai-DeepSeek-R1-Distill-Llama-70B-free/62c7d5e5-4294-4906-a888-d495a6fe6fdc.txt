Okay, so I've got this problem here about a glass vase that sells for $25.00. The question is asking for the gross profit on the vase. Hmm, I remember that in business, there are different types of profits, like gross profit and net profit. Let me think about what each means.

Net profit is the profit after all expenses have been deducted. So if the net profit is 7%, that 7% is calculated on the selling price or maybe the cost? Wait, I'm a bit confused. I think net profit is usually a percentage of the selling price or sometimes of the cost. I need to clarify that.

Wait, I think net profit margin is typically calculated as net profit divided by sales. So, Net Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Sales) * 100. So if the net profit is 7%, that means (Net Profit / $25) = 7% or 0.07. So Net Profit = 25 * 0.07 = $1.75. So the net profit is $1.75.

But wait, the question is about gross profit. Gross profit is the profit after subtracting the cost of goods sold (COGS) from sales. So, Gross Profit = Sales - COGS.

But how do I find COGS here? Oh, because operating expenses are given as 39%. I think operating expenses are part of the costs, but maybe they're separate from COGS. Wait, COGS usually includes direct costs like materials and labor, while operating expenses are other costs like rent, salaries, etc.

Wait, the problem says the operating expenses are 39%. I'm not sure if that percentage is of the selling price or something else. Maybe it's similar to the net profit, so 39% of the selling price goes to operating expenses.

Let me try to break it down.

Let me denote:

Sales (S) = $25.00

Net Profit (NP) = 7% of S = 0.07 *25 = $1.75

Operating Expenses (OE) = 39% of S = 0.39 *25 = $9.75

Wait, but how does this fit into the overall structure? I think the formula for Net Profit is:

Net Profit = Gross Profit - Operating Expenses

Because Gross Profit is Sales minus COGS, and Net Profit is after subtracting other expenses (OE).

So, starting with the selling price, we subtract COGS to get Gross Profit. Then, from Gross Profit, we subtract operating expenses to get Net Profit.

So, the equation would be:

NP = (S - COGS) - OE

So, rearranging, S - COGS - OE = NP.

We can write this as:

Gross Profit (GP) = S - COGS

And then, GP - OE = NP.

So, GP = NP + OE

We have NP as $1.75 and OE as $9.75.

So, GP = 1.75 + 9.75 = $11.50.

Wait, that would make the gross profit $11.50. Let me check the options. Option E is $11.50.

But wait, I'm not sure if I'm interpreting the percentages correctly. Let me think again.

Another approach: The net profit is 7% of the selling price. So that's $1.75. The operating expenses are 39% of the selling price, which is $9.75.

So the total costs (COGS + expenses) would be the selling price minus net profit. So:

Total Costs = S - NP = 25 - 1.75 = $23.25.

But wait, that doesn't seem right because if expenses are $9.75, then COGS would be 23.25 - 9.75 = 13.50. So GP would be S - COGS = 25 -13.50= $11.50. So that matches the earlier calculation.

So the gross profit is $11.50, which is option E.

Wait, but wait another thing. Maybe I'm mixing up the terms. Let me think about the structure:

In accounting, the income statement is:

Sales
- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) = Gross Profit
- Operating Expenses (OE) = Operating Income
- Other expenses = Net Income

So, Net Profit (Net Income) is after all expenses, including operating expenses.

So, in this problem, the Net Profit is 7% of Sales, which is $1.75.

Operating Expenses are 39% of Sales, which is $9.75.

So, the Gross Profit would be Sales minus COGS.

But from the income statement, Gross Profit minus Operating Expenses equals Operating Income, which in this case is before other expenses, but in this problem, maybe there are no other expenses beyond operating expenses, so the Net Profit would be Operating Income minus other things, but if there are no other expenses, then Net Profit = Gross Profit - OE.

Wait, but in the problem, the Net Profit is 7%, so:

Net Profit = Gross Profit - OE.

So, 1.75 = GP - 9.75 â†’ GP = 1.75 +9.75=11.50.

Yes, that's the same as before.

So the answer should be option E: $11.50.

To determine the gross profit on the vase, we start by analyzing the given data:

- **Selling Price (S)**: $25.00  
- **Net Profit (NP)**: 7% of the selling price  
- **Operating Expenses (OE)**: 39% of the selling price  

### Step 1: Calculate Net Profit
Net profit is calculated as a percentage of the selling price:  
\[
\text{NP} = 0.07 \times 25 = \$1.75
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Operating Expenses
Operating expenses are also calculated as a percentage of the selling price:  
\[
\text{OE} = 0.39 \times 25 = \$9.75
\]

### Step 3: Relate Gross Profit to Net Profit and Operating Expenses
The relationship between gross profit (GP), operating expenses, and net profit is:  
\[
\text{GP} - \text{OE} = \text{NP}
\]
Rearranging for GP:  
\[
\text{GP} = \text{NP} + \text{OE}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Gross Profit
Substitute the values of NP and OE:  
\[
\text{GP} = 1.75 + 9.75 = \$11.50
\]

### Final Answer
The gross profit on the vase is **$11.50**, which corresponds to option **E**.
