Okay, so I have this problem about radioactive isotopes, A and B. Let me try to understand it step by step.

The problem says that initially, there are twice as many atoms of A as B. So if I let the number of B atoms be N at the start, then A has 2N atoms. Got that.

Both isotopes decay, but they have different half-lives. A has a half-life of 3 days, B has 6 days. I remember that the number of atoms left after time t is given by N = N0 * (1/2)^(t / half-life). So for each isotope, I can write an expression for their remaining atoms after t days.

The question is asking when the ratio of A to B atoms will be reversed. Right now, the ratio is 2:1 (A:B). Reversed would mean B:A is 2:1, so the number of A atoms would be half that of B. Wait, no, wait. If the ratio reverses, then B would have twice as many as A. So I need to find the time t when N_A(t) / N_B(t) = 1/2.

Let me set up the equations. Let N_A0 = 2N_B0. Let me call N_B0 as N for simplicity. So N_A0 = 2N.

The decay equations:

N_A(t) = 2N * (1/2)^(t/3)
N_B(t) = N * (1/2)^(t/6)

We want N_A(t) / N_B(t) = 1/2.

So substitute:

[2N * (1/2)^(t/3)] / [N * (1/2)^(t/6)] = 1/2

Simplify numerator and denominator:

The N cancels out, so:

[2 * (1/2)^(t/3)] / [ (1/2)^(t/6) ) ] = 1/2

I can write this as 2 * (1/2)^(t/3 - t/6) ) = 1/2.

Wait, because (1/2)^a divided by (1/2)^b is (1/2)^(a-b). So in the numerator, (1/2)^(t/3) divided by (1/2)^(t/6) is (1/2)^(t/3 - t/6) = (1/2)^(t/6).

So putting it all together:

2 * (1/2)^(t/6) = 1/2.

Divide both sides by 2:

(1/2)^(t/6) = 1/4.

Hmm, because 2*(1/2)^(t/6) equals 1/2, so (1/2)^(t/6) is 1/4.

Wait, 1/4 is (1/2)^2. So (1/2)^(t/6) = (1/2)^2. Therefore, t/6 = 2.

So t = 12 days.

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check.

Another approach: Let me write the ratio as [2*(1/2)^(t/3)] / [ (1/2)^(t/6) ) ] = 1/2.

Simplify the exponents: (t/3) is 2t/6. So (1/2)^(2t/6) divided by (1/2)^(t/6) is (1/2)^(2t/6 - t/6) = (1/2)^(t/6).

So the equation becomes 2 * (1/2)^(t/6) = 1/2.

Divide both sides by 2: (1/2)^(t/6) = 1/4.

As before, 1/4 is (1/2)^2, so exponents must be equal: t/6 = 2 â†’ t=12 days.

Looking at the options, option C is 12.0.

To solve the problem, we analyze the decay of two radioactive isotopes, A and B, with half-lives of 3 days and 6 days, respectively. Initially, the number of A atoms is twice that of B atoms. We aim to find the time \( t \) when the ratio of A to B atoms is reversed, meaning \( N_A(t) / N_B(t) = 1/2 \).

### Step 1: Decay Equations
The number of atoms remaining after time \( t \) is given by:
\[
N_A(t) = N_{A0} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t / 3}, \quad N_B(t) = N_{B0} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t / 6}.
\]
Initially, \( N_{A0} = 2N_{B0} \). Let \( N_{B0} = N \), so \( N_{A0} = 2N \).

### Step 2: Ratio of Atoms
The ratio of A to B atoms at time \( t \) is:
\[
\frac{N_A(t)}{N_B(t)} = \frac{2N \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t / 3}}{N \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t / 6}}.
\]
Simplify:
\[
\frac{N_A(t)}{N_B(t)} = 2 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t/3 - t/6}.
\]
Since \( t/3 - t/6 = t/6 \), the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{N_A(t)}{N_B(t)} = 2 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t/6}.
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( t \)
We set the ratio equal to \( 1/2 \):
\[
2 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t/6} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]
Divide through by 2:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t/6} = \frac{1}{4}.
\]
Since \( \frac{1}{4} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \), equate the exponents:
\[
\frac{t}{6} = 2.
\]
Solve for \( t \):
\[
t = 12 \, \text{days}.
\]

### Final Answer
The ratio of A to B atoms will be reversed after **12 days**.
