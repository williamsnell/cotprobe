Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the final concentration of I^- ions after mixing two solutions. Hmm, I remember this has to do with chemical reactions and stoichiometry.

Alright, the problem says: What's the final concentration of I^- when you mix 35.0 mL of 0.100 M NaHSO3 with 10.0 mL of 0.100 M KIO3. And the volumes are additive, so I don't have to worry about contraction or expansion, just add them up.

Wait, so first, I need to think about what's happening when these two solutions are mixed. NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, and KIO3 is potassium iodate. Both are soluble in water, so they dissociate completely. So NaHSO3 dissociates into Na+ and HSO3^- ions. KIO3 dissociates into K+ and IO3^- ions.

But wait, when these two are mixed, HSO3^- and IO3^- are in the same solution. I think there's a possibility of a redox reaction here. Because IO3^- is a strong oxidizing agent, and HSO3^- (bisulfite) can act as a reducing agent. So they might react with each other.

So the reaction between IO3^- and HSO3^-... Let me think about their standard reduction potentials to see what's going on. I remember that IO3^- can oxidize other ions. Let me recall:

The relevant half-reactions are:

IO3^- + 6 H+ + 5 e^- → I2 + 3 H2O      E°red = 1.20 V (I think)
HSO3^- + 2 H+ + 2 e^- → SO2(g) + 2 H2O   E°red ≈ 0.14 V or something like that.

Wait, but wait—since IO3^- is a stronger oxidizing agent (higher E°), it will act as the oxidizing agent, and HSO3^- will be the reducing agent. So in the reaction, IO3^- (iodate) will be reduced, and HSO3^- will be oxidized.

So the oxidized form of HSO3^- is SO4^2-? Or wait, no, wait. Let me think. HSO3^- is sulfite, right? So when it's oxidized, it becomes SO4^2- (sulfate). And IO3^- is iodate, which when reduced becomes I2 (iodine).

Wait, wait. Let me get the half-reactions right.

The oxidation of HSO3^-: HSO3^- → SO4^2- + ... Let's balance this in acidic solution. 

HSO3^- → SO4^2-
Balancing S: 1 on each side.
O: on the left, 3 O; on the right, 4 O. So add H2O. Let's see:

HSO3^- → SO4^2- 
Add H2O to the left? Or maybe to the right. Hmm, better to think in steps.

Balancing the atoms other than O and H first. So S is balanced.

Now O: left has 3 O, right has 4. Add one H2O to the left:

HSO3^- + H2O → SO4^2- 

Now H: on the left, 2 H (from H2O) and 1 from HSO3^- → total 3 H on the left. On the right, none. So need to add H+ to the right.

So, 3 H+ on the right:

HSO3^- + H2O → SO4^2- + 3 H+

Now balance charges. Left side: HSO3^- has -1 charge. Right side: SO4^2- is -2, and 3 H+ is +3. Total on right is +1. So left is -1, right is +1. The difference is 2 electrons. So oxidation is loss of electrons, so electrons are on the right.

So HSO3^- + H2O → SO4^2- + 3 H+ + 2 e^-

Wait, no: because oxidation is loss of electrons, so in the oxidation half-reaction, electrons are products. So yes, the equation is as above.

Now the reduction half-reaction is IO3^- → I2.

IO3^- → I2
Balance I: done.
O: 3 O on left, none on right. So add H2O to the right.

IO3^- → I2 + 3 H2O

Now balance H by adding H+ to the left.

IO3^- + 6 H+ → I2 + 3 H2O

Now, balance the charge. Left side: IO3^- (-1) + 6 H+ (+6) → total +5. Right side: I2 is neutral, water is neutral. So difference is 5 electrons on the left (since reduction is gain of electrons).

So the reduction half-reaction is:

IO3^- + 6 H+ + 5 e^- → I2 + 3 H2O

Wait, adding 5 electrons to the left because it's a reduction (gain). Because in the balanced equation, the left side is +5, and the right is 0. So to balance, add 5 e^- to the left.

Now, to combine the two half-reactions. The oxidation is losing 2 e^-, and the reduction is gaining 5 e^-. So the least common multiple is 10 e^-. Multiply the oxidation by 5 and the reduction by 2.

Oxidation: 5 [HSO3^- + H2O → SO4^2- + 3 H+ + 2 e^- ] → overall: 5 HSO3^- + 5 H2O → 5 SO4^2- + 15 H+ + 10 e^-

Reduction: 2 [ IO3^- + 6 H+ + 5 e^- → I2 + 3 H2O ] → 2 IO3^- + 12 H+ + 10 e^- → 2 I2 + 6 H2O

Now add them together:

5 HSO3^- + 5 H2O + 2 IO3^- +12 H+ +10 e^- → 5 SO4^2- +15 H+ +10 e^- + 2 I2 +6 H2O

Simplify: The 10 e^- cancel out.

5 HSO3^- + 2 IO3^- + 12 H+ +5 H2O →5 SO4^2- +15 H+ + 2 I2 +6 H2O

Simplify H+ and H2O:

12 H+ on left, 15 H+ on right. So 15-12=3 H+ on right.

H2O: 5 H2O on left, 6 on right → net 1 H2O on right, which I can write as subtracting from left:

So 5 HSO3^- + 2 IO3^- + 12 H+ →5 SO4^2- +3 H+ + 2 I2 + 1 H2O

Wait, perhaps better to subtract common terms.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the overall equation as:

5 HSO3^- + 2 IO3^- → 5 SO4^2- + 2 I2 + 3 H+ + H2O - Wait not sure. Maybe I should recheck.

Wait let me recount the H+ after adding:

Left side: 12 H+ from IO3^- reaction, and 5 H2O (which is H and O). 

Wait maybe it's getting too complicated. Perhaps the overall equation is:

5 HSO3^- + 2 IO3^- + 3 H2O → 5 SO4^2- + 2 I2 + 5 H+ + 6 H2O ?

Wait I'm getting a bit stuck here, maybe I should just write the net ionic equation correctly.

The main thing is, combining the two half-reactions gives an overall reaction where IO3^- reacts with HSO3^- to produce I2 and SO4^2-.

But perhaps for the purpose of this problem, I can figure out the limiting reagent and calculate the moles reacting.

So first, I need to find the moles of each reactant.

The volume and concentrations are given. NaHSO3 is 35.0 mL of 0.100 M. So moles of HSO3^- is 0.035 L * 0.100 mol/L = 0.0035 mol.

Similarly, KIO3 is 10.0 mL of 0.100 M. Moles of IO3^- is 0.010 L * 0.100 = 0.001 mol.

Now, the reaction stoichiometry. From the balanced equation, the mole ratio between HSO3^- and IO3^- is 5:2.

So for every 5 moles of HSO3^-, 2 moles of IO3^- are consumed. 

So let's calculate the available moles and see which is the limiting reagent.

Available: 0.0035 mol HSO3^-, 0.001 mol IO3^-.

The required ratio is 5 HSO3 : 2 IO3.

So let's see how much IO3 is needed for all the HSO3 to react.

(0.0035 mol HSO3^-) * (2 IO3^- /5 HSO3^-) = (0.0035 * 2)/5 = 0.0014 mol IO3^- needed.

But only 0.001 mol IO3^- is present, which is less than 0.0014. So IO3^- is the limiting reagent.

Alternatively, let's see how much HSO3^- is needed for all IO3^- to react.

(0.001 mol IO3^-) * (5 HSO3^- /2 IO3^- ) = (0.001 *5)/2 = 0.0025 mol HSO3^- needed.

We have 0.0035, which is more than enough. So IO3^- is limiting.

So the reaction will consume all 0.001 mol IO3^-, and some HSO3^-.

Let me compute the amount of HSO3^- consumed.

Molar ratio is 5:2, so for 2 mol IO3^-, 5 mol HSO3^- used. So per 1 mol IO3^-, 2.5 mol HSO3^- consumed.

Wait, no, for 2 IO3^-, 5 HSO3^- are consumed. So for 1 IO3^-, 2.5 HSO3^-.

So for 0.001 mol IO3^-, HSO3^- consumed is 0.001 * (5/2) = 0.0025 mol.

So initial HSO3^-: 0.0035 mol.

After reaction: 0.0035 - 0.0025 = 0.001 mol HSO3^- remaining.

Wait, but wait, the products are I2 and SO4^2-.

So the moles of I2 produced will depend on the stoichiometry.

From the reaction, 2 IO3^- → 2 I2. So for 0.001 mol IO3^-, we get 0.001 mol I2.

Wait no, looking back at the overall equation, the stoichiometry was 2 IO3^- → 2 I2. So 1:1 ratio. So 0.001 mol IO3^- produces 0.001 mol I2.

Wait, but in the combined equation, 2 IO3^- → 2 I2. So yes, 1:1.

So 0.001 mol IO3^- produces 0.001 mol I2.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Because the combined equation after scaling was 5 HSO3^- + 2 IO3^- → 5 SO4^2- + 2 I2 + ... other stuff. So the ratio is 5 HSO3^- to 2 IO3^-, which produces 2 I2. So 2 IO3^- → 2 I2, so 1:1.

So the moles of I2 produced are 0.001 mol.

But wait, the problem is asking about the concentration of I^- ions in the solution. Wait, I thought I2 would precipitate or something. But no, I2 is a solid, but in solution, it's possible. Wait, but in reality, I2 is not very soluble in water, but perhaps in this problem we're considering it's dissolved. Hmm, but wait, the question is about I^-.

Wait, wait a second! The product is I2, which is elemental iodine (I2 molecules). I^-, or iodide ions, are different. So in this reaction, IO3^- is reduced to I2, not to I^-.

So the I2 is a molecule, not an ion. So after the reaction, the solution contains I2, but no I^- ions. But wait, that's confusing because the problem is asking about I^-.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. Maybe I should have considered a different reaction where IO3^- oxidizes I^- to I2. But in this problem, the other solution is NaHSO3, which provides HSO3^-.

Wait, perhaps I got the reaction wrong. Because, wait, the solutions are NaHSO3 and KIO3. So the ions present are HSO3^- and IO3^-. So the possible reaction is between these two.

I think I did it right earlier, where IO3^- oxidizes HSO3^- to SO4^2-, and itself is reduced to I2. So the products are I2 and SO4^2-.

But then, where does I^- come from? Because in this reaction, the iodine is in I2 form, not as I^-.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial reaction. Maybe the reaction between IO3^- and HSO3^- produces I^- instead of I2. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should check the possible products. In acidic solution, IO3^- can oxidize HSO3^-.

Wait, I think I might have made an error in the half-reactions. Let me double-check the standard reduction potentials.

Another approach: the standard reduction potential for IO3^- → I2 is higher than that of HSO3^- → SO2. So IO3^- is a stronger oxidizing agent.

Wait, here are the standard E° values:

IO3^- + 6 H+ + 5 e^- → I2 + 3 H2O      E° = 1.20 V

HSO3^- + 2 H+ + 2 e^- → SO2 + 2 H2O   E° = 0.14 V

So the IO3 reaction has higher E°, so it's the oxidizing agent, HSO3^- is the reducing agent.

So in the reaction, IO3^- is reduced to I2, and HSO3^- is oxidized to SO2. Wait, but in the initial problem, the solution after mixing would have I2 and SO2, but where is I^-?

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the products. Because if IO3^- is reduced to I2, then the solution would not have I^- ions. Unless some I2 undergoes hydrolysis, but that's probably negligible, especially in acidic conditions.

Wait, but perhaps the reaction doesn't go to I2. Maybe in this case, the product is I^- instead. Let me think again.

Wait, another possible reaction: IO3^- could oxidize I^- to I2, but in this problem, the other solution is HSO3^-, so perhaps I'm mixing up the reactions.

Wait, no, the two ions present are HSO3^- and IO3^-; no I^- initially. So the reaction is between IO3^- and HSO3^-, producing I2 and SO4^2- or SO2.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, the reaction produces I2, which is a molecule, so no I^- in solution. So the concentration of I^- would be zero, but that's not among the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me think again about the possible products.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is different. Let's consider that IO3^- oxidizes HSO3^- to S, and is itself reduced to I^-.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense in terms of standard reduction potentials. Because HSO3^- is a better reducing agent than I^-.

Wait, perhaps I should write the possible reactions again.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is:

IO3^- + HSO3^- → I^- + SO4^2- 

But I'm not sure about the exact stoichiometry. Let me try to balance this.

Wait, another approach: write the two half-reactions.

Reduction: IO3^- → I^-
Oxidation: HSO3^- → SO4^2-

Wait, but what's the E° for IO3^- → I^-?

The standard reduction for I2 → 2 I^- is 0.54 V. So the reverse would be oxidation: 2 I^- → I2 + 2 e^-, E°= -0.54 V.

Wait, but that's for I2. For IO3^- → I^-, let me see.

The standard reduction potential for IO3^- + 6 H+ + 5 e^- → 1/2 I2 + 3 H2O is 1.20 V.

If IO3^- is reduced to I^- instead of I2, what would be the potential?

Let me think: IO3^- → I^-.

Balancing in acidic solution.

IO3^- → I^-

I: 1 each.

O: 3 O on left, none on right. Add H2O.

IO3^- → I^- + 3 H2O

Now balance H by adding H+.

IO3^- → I^- + 3 H2O + 6 H+

Now balance charge. Left: -1. Right: (-1) + 6(+) = +5. So to balance, add 6 electrons to the left.

IO3^- + 6 e^- → I^- + 3 H2O + 6 H+

But wait, this is a reduction because we're adding electrons. So the E° for this reaction would be different.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact E° values. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction I initially considered is correct, and I2 is the product, meaning no I^- in solution.

But the problem asks for I^- concentration, so that can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the reaction.

Wait, perhaps the correct reaction
