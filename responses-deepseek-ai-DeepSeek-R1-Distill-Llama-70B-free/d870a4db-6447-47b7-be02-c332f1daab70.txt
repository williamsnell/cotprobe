Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the reflection coefficient for voltage waves on a transmission line. Hmm, I remember that the reflection coefficient is an important concept in transmission lines and impedance matching. Let me think about what I learned.

The question says the transmission line is 50 ohms and it's terminated with a load impedance of 25 - j75 ohms. Right, the reflection coefficient, often denoted by Γ (Gamma), tells us how much of the voltage wave is reflected when it reaches the load. If the load impedance matches the transmission line's characteristic impedance, there's no reflection, so Γ would be zero. But when there's a mismatch, Γ is non-zero.

The formula for the reflection coefficient when dealing with a load impedance ZL and characteristic impedance Z0 is Γ = (ZL - Z0) / (ZL + Z0). Oh wait, wait, no, actually, I think it's (ZL - Z0) divided by (ZL + Z0). Or was it Z0 in the numerator? Wait, no, maybe I got that backwards.

Wait, no, the correct formula is Γ = (ZL - Z0) / (ZL + Z0). Because when ZL is greater than Z0, Γ is positive, leading to a positive reflection. And when ZL is less than Z0, Γ is negative, meaning the reflection is inverted.

So in this case, Z0 is 50 ohms, and ZL is 25 - j75 ohms. Oh, right, because the load has a complex impedance here. So I need to plug these into the formula.

First, let me compute the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is ZL - Z0. That would be (25 - j75) - 50. Let's compute that: 25 -50 is -25, and the imaginary part is -j75. So the numerator is (-25 - j75) ohms.

The denominator is ZL + Z0. So that's (25 - j75) + 50. 25 +50 is 75, so denominator is 75 -j75.

So Γ = (-25 -j75) / (75 -j75).

Hmm, that's a complex number divided by another complex number. I think the best way to compute this is to represent both numerator and denominator in polar form and then divide their magnitudes and subtract their angles. Alternatively, I can multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator to make the denominator real.

Let me try the complex conjugate method. So the denominator is 75 - j75. Its complex conjugate is 75 + j75. So I'll multiply both numerator and denominator by (75 + j75).

So numerator becomes (-25 -j75)(75 + j75). Let me compute that.

Multiply each term:

-25 *75 = -1875

-25 * j75 = -j1875

-j75 *75 = -j5625

-j75 *j75 = -j² 75^2 = since j² is -1, this is + 75^2 * 1.

75^2 is 5625, so that term is +5625.

Adding all the terms together:

Real parts: (-1875) +5625 = 3750.

Imaginary parts: (-j1875 -j5625) = -j7500.

So the numerator becomes (3750 - j7500).

The denominator is (75 -j75)(75 +j75) = 75^2 + (75)^2, because (a - jb)(a + jb) = a² + b².

So 75^2 is 5625. So 5625 +5625 = 11250.

So Γ = (3750 -j7500)/11250.

Simplify that by dividing each term by 11250.

3750 /11250 is 0.333... or 1/3. Similarly, 7500 /11250 is 0.666... or 2/3.

So Γ = (1/3) - j (2/3). 

Wait, wait no, because 3750 is 1/3 of 11250, and 7500 is 2/3, but with a negative sign. So Γ is (1/3) - j (2/3). 

Wait, no, wait, 3750 is 0.333... of 11250, and 7500 is 0.666... So Γ is (0.333 - j0.666).

Wait, let me double-check. 3750 is 1/3 of 11250, yes. Because 11250 /3 is 3750.

So Γ = (1/3) - j (2/3). So that's approximately 0.3333 - j0.6666.

But wait, the answer options are in terms of magnitude and angle. So I need to convert Γ into polar form.

The magnitude is sqrt( (1/3)^2 + (2/3)^2 ) = sqrt( (1 +4)/9 ) = sqrt(5/9) = sqrt(5)/3.

sqrt(5) is approximately 2.236, so sqrt(5)/3 ≈ 0.745. So the magnitude is about 0.745.

The angle θ is arctangent of (imaginary part / real part). But wait, since real part is positive and imaginary part is negative, the angle is in the fourth quadrant.

Imaginary part is -2/3, real part is +1/3. So arctan( (-2/3) / (1/3) ) = arctan(-2). So that's -63.4349 degrees approximately. But since it's in the fourth quadrant, the angle is 360 -63.4349 = 296.5651 degrees. Or sometimes expressed as negative angle: -63.4349 degrees.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, when using the standard polar form, the angle is measured from the positive real axis, counterclockwise. So if the point is in the fourth quadrant, the angle would be -63.4349 degrees. But looking at the options, some have angles around 116 degrees. Wait, am I mixing something up?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute the angle again.

Wait, Γ is (1/3) - j(2/3). So real part is positive, and imaginary part is negative. So in the complex plane, it would be in the fourth quadrant.

The arctangent is (opposite/adjacent) = (2/3)/(1/3) = 2. So the reference angle is arctan(2) ≈63.4349 degrees. Since it's in the fourth quadrant, the angle is 360 - 63.4349 = 296.5651 degrees. But often, in electrical engineering, we use the negative angle, so -63.4349 degrees.

But looking at the options, most of them have angles like -116.56 or similar. So maybe I did something wrong earlier.

Wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the numerator and denominator. Let me go back.

Wait, let me re-calculate Γ.

Γ = (ZL - Z0)/(ZL + Z0) = (25 -j75 -50 )/(25 -j75 +50 )= (-25 -j75)/(75 -j75).

Yes, that's correct.

So when I did the multiplication by (75 + j75), I got:

Numerator: (-25 -j75)(75 +j75) = let's compute it again.

Multiply each term:

-25 *75 = -1875.

-25 * j75 = -j1875.

-j75 *75 = -j5625.

-j75 *j75 = -j²*75^2 → j² is -1, so it's +75^2 = 5625.

So adding all four terms:

Real: (-1875 +5625) = 3750.

Imaginary: (-j1875 -j5625) = -j7500.

So numerator is 3750 -j7500.

Denominator is 75^2 +75^2 = 2*(75)^2 =2*5625=11250.

So Γ= (3750 -j7500)/11250 = (3750/11250) - j (7500/11250) = 0.3333 -j 0.6666.

Wait, that's correct. So Γ is 0.3333 -j0.6666. So the magnitude is sqrt( (0.3333)^2 + (0.6666)^2 ) → sqrt(0.1111 +0.4444) = sqrt(0.5555) ≈ 0.745.

And the angle is arctan( (-0.6666)/0.3333 ) = arctan(-2) which is about -63.4349 degrees.

Wait, but the answer options are showing angles like -116.56 degrees. So why is there a discrepancy? Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, let me think. Oh wait a minute, perhaps I forgot to account for the fact that the load impedance is a complex number, which could mean that the reflection coefficient's angle is different. Or maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the angle differently. Let me think about the angle.

Wait, Γ is 0.3333 -j0.6666. So it's in the fourth quadrant. The angle is negative, as I thought. But wait, perhaps in the options, the angles are given as positive by taking 180 + the reference angle.

Wait, let me compute the reference angle again. The reference angle is arctan( (0.6666)/(0.3333) ) = arctan(2) ≈63.4349 degrees. Since the real part is positive and the imaginary part is negative, the angle is -63.4349 degrees, or equivalently 360 -63.4349 = 296.5651 degrees.

But none of the options have that angle. So perhaps I'm missing something here. Hmm. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A: 0.745∠-116.5651°
B: 0.675∠-116.5651°
C: 0.745∠116.5651°
D: -0.745∠-116.5651°
E: -0.745∠116.5651°
F: 0.835∠-116.5651°
G: -0.835∠-116.5651°
H: -0.835∠116.5651°
I: -0.675∠116.5651°
J: -0.745∠-146.310°

Wait, option A is 0.745 at -116.56 degrees, which is close to 180-63.43=116.56, but negative. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should compute the angle using the formula θ = arctan( (Imaginary part)/(Real part) ), but taking signs into account. Since the real part is positive and the imaginary part is negative, the angle is in the fourth quadrant, so θ is negative. But perhaps in the options, the angle is represented as a positive angle in the third quadrant? Wait, no, because 116 degrees is in the second quadrant, and -116 is equivalent to 244 degrees, which is in the third.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the reflection coefficient. Let me double-check.

Wait, Z0 is 50, ZL is 25 -j75.

So Γ = (ZL - Z0)/(ZL + Z0) = (25 -j75 -50)/(25 -j75 +50) = (-25 -j75)/(75 -j75).

So that's correct. Now, when I compute Γ as ( -25 -j75 ) / (75 -j75 ), which is ( (-25 -j75) ) / (75 -j75 ) = [ (-25)(1 + j3) ) ] / [75 (1 - j1) ) ].

Wait, perhaps I can factor out 25 from numerator and 75 from denominator.

So numerator is -25(1 +j3), denominator is 75(1 -j1). So Γ becomes [ (-25/75) * (1 +j3)/(1 -j1) ) ].

Simplify -25/75 → -1/3. So Γ = (-1/3) * (1 +j3)/(1 -j1).

Let me compute (1 +j3)/(1 -j1). Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 +j1):

(1 +j3)(1 +j1) / ( (1)^2 + (1)^2 )= [ (1)(1) + 1(j1) + j3(1) + j3(j1) ) ] / 2.

Which is [1 +j1 +j3 +j^2*3 ] = 1 +j4 -3 → (-2 +j4).

So denominator becomes 2.

So (1+j3)/(1-j1) = (-2 +j4)/2 = (-1 +j2).

So Γ = (-1/3) * (-1 + j2 ) = (1/3)(1 - j2).

Wait, wait, wait. Let me re-calculate that.

Wait, (1 +j3)/(1 -j1) = [ (1 +j3)(1 +j1) ] / (1 +1) = [ (1*1 +1*j1 +j3*1 +j3*j1) ] / 2.

Which is (1 +j1 +j3 +j4) / 2. Because j3*j1 = j^2*3 = -3.

So 1 -3 = -2. j1 +j3 = j(1+3) = j4.

So numerator is (-2 +j4), denominator 2.

So (1 +j3)/(1 -j1) = (-2 +j4)/2 = (-1 +j2).

So Γ = (-1/3) * (-1 + j2 ) → (1/3)(1 - j2) → 1/3 - j2/3.

Wait, but earlier I had Γ = 0.3333 -j0.6666, which matches this result. So that's correct.

So Γ is (1/3) -j (2/3). So magnitude is sqrt( (1/3)^2 + (2/3)^2 ) = sqrt(1/9 +4/9) = sqrt(5)/3 ≈0.745.

The angle is arctan( ( -2/3 ) / (1/3) ) = arctan(-2) ≈-63.4349 degrees.

So the reflection coefficient has magnitude approximately 0.745 and angle -63.43 degrees.

But looking at the answer options, none of the options have -63 degrees. They have -116.56 degrees. So what's going on here?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula. Did I get the formula wrong? Let me double-check.

The reflection coefficient is Γ = (ZL - Z0)/(ZL + Z0). Wait, no, wait another thought: some sources define it as (Z0 - ZL)/(Z0 + ZL), but no, that would be the reverse. Wait, no, the correct formula is (ZL - Z0)/(ZL + Z0). Because when ZL is higher than Z0, the reflection is positive.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the complex number in a different way. Let me think: 0.3333 -j0.6666. The magnitude is indeed approximately 0.745. The angle is arctan( (-0.6666)/(0.3333) ) = arctan(-2), which is -63.43 degrees.

But the options have -116.56 degrees. Hmm, that's about 180 -63.43 = 116.57, so negative would be -116.57. So why is that?

Wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the angle. Because the reflection coefficient formula is (ZL - Z0)/(ZL + Z0), but ZL is complex. So maybe I should compute the angle differently.

Wait, another approach: compute the reflection coefficient as (ZL - Z0)/(ZL + Z0).

Compute ZL - Z0 = (25 - j75) -50 = -25 -j75.

ZL + Z0 = (25 -j75) +50 =75 -j75.

So Γ = (-25 -j75) / (75 -j75).

Let me compute this using another approach. Let me write both numerator and denominator in polar form.

First, compute the magnitude and angle of the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: -25 -j75.

Magnitude: sqrt(25^2 +75^2) = sqrt(625 +5625) = sqrt(6250) = 25*sqrt(10) ≈25 *3.1623 ≈79.07 ohms.

Angle: arctangent(75/25) = arctan(3) = 71.5651 degrees. But since both real and imaginary parts are negative (numerator is -25 -j75), the point is in the third quadrant. So the angle is 180 +71.5651 = 251.5651 degrees.

Denominator: 75 -j75.

Magnitude: sqrt(75^2 +75^2) = sqrt(2 *75^2 )=75*sqrt(2)≈106.066 ohms.

Angle: arctangent( -75/75 )= arctan(-1) = -45 degrees. Since the real part is positive and imaginary part is negative, the angle is in the fourth quadrant, so 360 -45 =315 degrees, or equivalently -45 degrees.

So Γ is [ (25 sqrt(10)) ∠251.5651° ] / [75 sqrt(2) ∠315° ].

Compute magnitude: (25 sqrt(10)) / (75 sqrt(2)) )= (25/75) * (sqrt(10)/sqrt(2)) )= (1/3) * sqrt(5) ≈0.745.

The angle: (251.5651 -315) = -63.4349 degrees. Which matches what I calculated before.

So Γ is 0.745 ∠-63.4349°. But the options don't have this angle. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 0.745∠-116.5651°, which is a different angle. So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the angle of the numerator and denominator. Let me recheck the angles.

Numerator: -25 -j75.

In the complex plane, this is in the
