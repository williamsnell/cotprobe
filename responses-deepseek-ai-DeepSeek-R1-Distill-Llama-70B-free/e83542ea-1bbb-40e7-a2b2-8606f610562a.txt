Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A state built a casino and issued bonds to finance its construction. On five occasions, there were episodes of violence in various casinos in the state. The state police attributed the violence to greed and fear at the casinos. To prevent such violence, the state legislature passes a statute prohibiting all gambling at privately owned casinos in the state. Is this law likely to be held constitutional if most casinos in the state were owned by those from out-of-state?

Options:

A: Yes, because the act was expressly authorized by the state legislature.
B: No, because the state does not have the authority to regulate commerce.
C: No, because this would infringe on the rights of out-of-state business owners.
D: Yes, but only if the casinos were given notice and an opportunity to be heard before the law was passed.
E: Yes, but only if the local interest in safety outweighs the burden of interstate commerce.
F: No, because the statute violates the due process rights of the owners of the casinos.
G: Yes, but only if the state can prove that the violence was directly caused by the casinos.
H: No, because out-of-state casinos are part of interstate commerce.
I: No, because the state cannot interfere with private businesses.
J: Yes, because the state has the power to regulate businesses within its borders.

Okay, so I've got this question about constitutional law, specifically dealing with state legislation and its impact on interstate commerce. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

The situation is that a state built a casino using bonds, so they've invested in this project. Then, there were five violent incidents at various casinos. The state police think it's because of greed and fear. So the legislature steps in and passes a statute that prohibits all gambling at privately owned casinos. But here's the catch: most of these casinos are owned by out-of-state people. The question is whether this law would be constitutional.

I remember that when states pass laws, they have to consider the Commerce Clause in the Constitution, which gives Congress the power to regulate commerce among the states. But the Supreme Court has interpreted this to mean that states can't unduly burden interstate commerce. There's the dormant commerce clause theory, right? So states can't pass laws that discriminate against out-of-state businesses or place an undue burden on interstate commerce.

Looking at the options, I need to figure out which one applies. The law here is targeting privately owned casinos, especially those owned by out-of-staters. So if the state is prohibiting gambling in these, it's affecting interstate commerce because out-of-state businesses are involved.

Option A says yes because the legislature authorized it. But just because they passed it doesn't make it constitutional. So A is probably wrong.

Option B says no because the state can't regulate commerce. But states do have some authority, like for health and safety, as long as it doesn't unduly burden interstate commerce. So B might be too broad.

Option C says no because it infringes on out-of-state business owners' rights. That sounds like it's touching on the Commerce Clause issue, where states can't discriminate against out-of-state businesses. This seems relevant.

Option D talks about notice and opportunity to be heard. That's more about due process, but the question is about the law's constitutionality, not procedure. So D might not be the right angle.

Option E says yes if the local interest outweighs the burden. This brings to mind the test from cases like Pike v. Bruce Church, where the court balances the local interest against the burden on interstate commerce. If the state's interest in safety is strong enough and the burden isn't too great, it might be upheld. But wait, in this case, the state is banning all gambling in private casinos, which could be a significant burden. Plus, if most are out-of-state, it might look discriminatory.

Option F is about due process. The statute is a general law affecting all private casinos, so maybe not a due process issue unless it's targeting specific individuals without process, which doesn't seem to be the case here.

Option G says yes if the state proves violence was caused by casinos. But even if they can prove it, the law might still be invalid if it's too broad or discriminates against interstate commerce. So G might not be the correct reason.

Option H says no because out-of-state casinos are part of interstate commerce. That aligns with the idea that the state can't impede interstate commerce, especially if the law affects out-of-state businesses more. This seems like a possible answer.

Option I says the state can't interfere with private businesses. But states do regulate businesses all the time for various reasons, so this is too broad. So I is probably wrong.

Option J says yes because the state can regulate businesses within its borders. While that's true to an extent, the Commerce Clause limits this when it affects interstate commerce. So J is too simplistic.

Putting it all together: The law is likely to be found unconstitutional because it's affecting out-of-state businesses (interstate commerce) and may be seen as discriminating against them. So the correct answer would be either C or H.

Between C and H, C says it's about infringing rights of out-of-state owners. H says it's because they're part of interstate commerce. The Commerce Clause issue is more about the state interfering with interstate commerce, not just individual rights. So H might be the better choice, but wait, another angle: if the law treats in-state and out-of-state businesses differently, that's discrimination. Here, the state owns a casino and is banning private ones, but it's not clear if in-state private casinos exist. If most are out-of-state, the ban could disproportionately affect them, which is discrimination against interstate commerce. That would make option C correct because it's about infringing on out-of-state business owners' rights.

Wait, but the law applies to all private casinos regardless of ownership. So if the state-owned casino is public, and the private ones are banned, then the law affects all private, whether in-state or out. But the fact that most are out-of-state might mean the law has a disparate impact. But the question is about whether it's likely to be held constitutional.

Alternatively, the Supreme Court in cases like South Carolina State Highway Dept. v. Barnwell Brothers (the Barnwell case) and later cases have held that even if a state law applies to in-state and out-of-state equally, if it has the effect of favoring in-state interests over out-of-state, it can be invalid.

In this scenario, the state built a casino, so they might be protecting their own interest by banning private competition. If the private casinos are mostly out-of-state, then the law could be seen as benefiting the state's own casino by eliminating competition, thus burdening interstate commerce.

So the correct reasoning is that it violates the Commerce Clause because it's unduly burdening interstate commerce, possibly discriminating against out-of-state businesses. So looking at the options, option H says no because out-of-state casinos are part of interstate commerce. Alternatively, option C says it's infringing on out-of-state business owners' rights.

Wait, another point: the Commerce Clause isn't just about discrimination but also about whether the regulation excessively burdens interstate commerce. So perhaps the law is a complete prohibition, which is a significant burden. So under the Pike test, if the burden on interstate commerce outweighs the local interest, it's invalid.

In this case, the local interest is preventing violence, but the burden is a total ban on private casinos, which could be seen as more than necessary. So the law might fail the balancing test, meaning it's unconstitutional.

So looking at the options, E says yes but only if the local interest outweighs the burden. So if E is correct, the answer would be E. But I'm not sure because the question is about whether the law is "likely" to be held constitutional.

Alternatively, if the law discriminates against out-of-state businesses, it's per se invalid. So if the law has the effect of protecting the state's casino (which is public) by banning private ones (mostly out-of-state), it's discriminatory.

So in that case, the answer might be C or H. Let me think again.

Option C says it's unconstitutional because it's infringing on the rights of out-of-state business owners.

Option H says it's unconstitutional because out-of-state casinos are part of interstate commerce.

The Commerce Clause is about the state's power, not individual rights per se. So H is the better answer because it's about the state's authority over interstate commerce.

Wait, but another angle: the Privileges and Immunities Clause also protects out-of-state businesses from discrimination. So option C could be invoking that. But the question is more about the Commerce Clause.

In any case, the likely answer is E or H.

Wait, another thought: In the case where a state entirely prohibits an activity that is part of interstate commerce, the court might find it's an undue burden. For example, in the case of the state banning the importation of waste, the Supreme Court struck it down because it was blocking interstate commerce, even though the state had a legitimate interest.

So in this case, if the state is banning all gambling at private casinos, which are mostly out-of-state owned, it could be seen as a clear burden on interstate commerce. So the law would likely be held unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause.

Looking at the options, option H says no because out-of-state casinos are part of interstate commerce. So H is the correct choice.

The question revolves around whether a state law prohibiting gambling at privately owned casinos, most of which are owned by out-of-state individuals, is constitutional. This raises issues under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, which prohibits states from unduly burdening interstate commerce or discriminating against out-of-state businesses.

The analysis begins by recognizing that while states have some authority to regulate for health and safety, this power is limited by the Commerce Clause. The law in question imposes a complete ban on gambling at private casinos, which could disproportionately affect out-of-state businesses. This suggests a potential violation of the Commerce Clause, as the law may be seen as discriminating against interstate commerce or imposing an excessive burden on it.

Option A is incorrect because legislative authorization does not automatically make a law constitutional. Option B is too broad, as states do have some authority to regulate commerce. Option C is relevant because it highlights the infringement on out-of-state business owners' rights, but the issue is more about the state's authority under the Commerce Clause than individual rights. Option D is incorrect because the question focuses on the law's constitutionality, not procedural due process. Option E introduces the balancing test from *Pike v. Bruce Church*, but the law's complete ban on private casinos likely imposes a significant burden on interstate commerce, making it unlikely to pass this test. Option F is incorrect because the law is a general regulation, not a targeted violation of due process. Option G is insufficient because proving causation between casinos and violence does not resolve the Commerce Clause issue. Option I is too broad, as states can regulate businesses within their borders. Option J is overly simplistic, as it ignores the limitations imposed by the Commerce Clause.

The correct answer hinges on the Commerce Clause. The law likely imposes an undue burden on interstate commerce by banning private casinos, many of which are out-of-state owned. This aligns with Option H, which emphasizes that out-of-state casinos are part of interstate commerce and that the law's ban unduly interferes with it.

Answer: H
