Okay, I have this problem where I need to find the determinant of a 6x6 matrix. Hmm, I remember that calculating determinants for large matrices can get really complicated, especially manually. But wait, maybe there's a pattern or something in this matrix that can make things easier.

Looking at the matrix A, let me write it out to see if I notice anything. So, the matrix is:

1  0  0  0  0  0
2  7  0  0  0  0
3  8  6  0  0  0
4  9  5  2  1  4
5  8  4  0  2  5
6  7  3  0  3  6

Hmm, I see that the first three rows have a lot of zeros after the third column. Oh wait, maybe it's a block matrix? Like, maybe it's upper or lower triangular except for some parts. But looking at the lower rows, the fourth row has non-zero elements in the fourth column, which breaks the triangular structure. So that might not help.

Wait, another approach: maybe perform row operations to simplify the matrix into an upper triangular form because the determinant is the product of the diagonal elements in that case. Let me think about how to do that.

Starting with the first row, it has a leading 1, which is good. The element below it in the second row is 2. I can subtract 2 times the first row from the second row to eliminate the 2. Let me try that.

Row2_new = Row2 - 2*Row1
So Row2 becomes [2-2*1, 7-2*0, 0-2*0, ...] which is [0,7,0,0,0,0]. Oh wait, that's not correct because the rest of the elements would also change. Wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's see: the first element is 2 - 2*1 = 0. The second is 7 - 2*0 =7. The third element is 0-0=0, etc. So the new second row becomes [0,7,0,0,0,0]. That's better.

Now, moving to the third row. It starts with 3. I can eliminate this by subtracting 3 times Row1 from Row3. So Row3_new = Row3 -3*Row1. The first element becomes 3-3*1=0. Second element:8 -3*0=8. Third:6-0=6. The rest remain as they are. So new third row is [0,8,6,0,0,0].

Wait, but the third row's third element is 6. So, in the upper triangular matrix, the third element in the third row should stay. Hmm, but I'm trying to make zeros below the pivot in each column. So maybe I can proceed column by column.

Wait, perhaps another way is to expand the determinant using minors along the first row since it has a lot of zeros. The first row is [1,0,0,0,0,0]. When expanding along the first row, the determinant is 1 * minor of (1,1) element, and all other terms are zero because the rest are multiplied by zero. So the determinant is just the minor of the element at (1,1), which is the determinant of the 5x5 submatrix obtained by removing the first row and first column.

Let me write down this 5x5 submatrix. It looks like:

7 0 0 0 0
8 6 0 0 0
9 5 2 1 4
8 4 0 2 5
7 3 0 3 6

Wait, no. Let me check. The original matrix after removing row 1 and column 1:

Row2: 2,7,0,0,0,0 → becomes [7,0,0,0,0] as the first row of the minor.

Row3: 3,8,6,0,0,0 → becomes [8,6,0,0,0].

Row4:4,9,5,2,1,4 → becomes [9,5,2,1,4].

Row5:5,8,4,0,2,5 → becomes [8,4,0,2,5].

Row6:6,7,3,0,3,6 → becomes [7,3,0,3,6].

So the minor matrix is:

[7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[8,6,0,0,0]
[9,5,2,1,4]
[8,4,0,2,5]
[7,3,0,3,6]

Now, computing the determinant of this 5x5 matrix. Again, perhaps focusing on zeros to simplify. Let's look for a row or column with zeros. The first row has four zeros except the first element. So, expanding along the first row would be efficient.

The determinant is 7 * minor of (1,1) element in this 5x5 matrix. So, I'll create a 4x4 matrix by removing the first row and first column.

The 4x4 submatrix is:

[6,0,0,0]
[5,2,1,4]
[4,0,2,5]
[3,0,3,6]

Wait, let me check each row correctly. The 5x5 minor's rows after removing row 1 and column 1 are:

Row2: [8,6,0,0,0] → remove first element → [6,0,0,0]

Row3: [9,5,2,1,4] → remove first element → [5,2,1,4]

Row4: [8,4,0,2,5] → remove first element → [4,0,2,5]

Row5: [7,3,0,3,6] → remove first element → [3,0,3,6]

So the 4x4 matrix is:

6 0 0 0
5 2 1 4
4 0 2 5
3 0 3 6

Now, computing the determinant of this 4x4 matrix. Again, perhaps expanding along the first row, which has three zeros.

So the determinant is 6 * minor of (1,1) element. The minor is the determinant of the 3x3 matrix obtained by removing row 1 and column 1.

The 3x3 matrix is:

2 1 4
0 2 5
0 3 6

So compute the determinant of this 3x3. Using the rule of Sarrus or expansion.

Expanding along the first column since it has two zeros.

The determinant is 2 * minor of (1,1) element (which is 2) minus 0 + 0.

Wait, the 3x3 matrix is:

Row1: [2,1,4]
Row2: [0,2,5]
Row3: [0,3,6]

Expanding along the first column:

2 * det( [ [2,5], [3,6] ] ) - 0 + 0.

The determinant of the 2x2 matrix is (2*6 -5*3) = 12-15 = -3.

So the 3x3 determinant is 2 * (-3) = -6.

Wait wait, let me double-check that. The minor for element (1,1) is the 2x2 matrix:

[2,5]
[3,6]

Which is (2*6) - (5*3) = 12 -15 = -3.

So the 3x3 determinant is 2 * (-3) = -6?

Wait no, wait. When I expand along the first column, the cofactor for (1,1) is (+1)^{1+1} * M11. So that's 1 * (-3), giving -3. Then, since the other elements in the first column are zero, the determinant is 2*(-3) = -6.

Wait, but wait. Actually, in the expansion, it's the element multiplied by its cofactor. So for element (1,1) which is 2, the cofactor is (+1)^(1+1) * det(minor) = 1 * (-3). So 2 * (-3) = -6. Correct.

So the 3x3 determinant is -6.

Now, going back, the 4x4 determinant is 6 * (-6) = -36.

Wait no. Wait, the 4x4 determinant is 6 multiplied by the determinant of the 3x3 matrix, which is -6. So 6*(-6) = -36.

So the 5x5 determinant is 7 * (-36) = -252.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. The 5x5 determinant was 7 multiplied by the 4x4 determinant, which we found as -36. So yes, 7*(-36) = -252.

But wait, the initial determinant was the 6x6 matrix. And we had expanded along the first row, leading to 1 * minor, which was the 5x5 determinant. So the 6x6 determinant is 1 * (5x5 determinant) = (-252).

Wait, but looking at the options, D is 0, and other options have H as -252. So the determinant should be -252.

Wait, but let me double-check all the steps to avoid any mistake.

First, the 6x6 matrix: expanding along first row gives 1 * det(5x5).

5x5 matrix: expanding along first row gives 7 * det(4x4).

4x4 matrix: expanding along first row gives 6 * det(3x3).

3x3 matrix: expanding along first column gives 2 * det([2,5],[3,6]) → 2*(12-15)=2*(-3)=-6.

So 3x3 det is -6.

4x4 det is 6*(-6) = -36.

5x5 det is 7*(-36) = -252.

6x6 det is 1*(-252) = -252.

Looking at the options, option H is -252, so the answer should be H.

Wait, but I should make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the minors.

Alternative approach: Maybe using another method. Are there any row operations that can simplify the calculation?

Looking back at the original 6x6 matrix, perhaps I can expand along another row or column with more zeros. The first row has only one non-zero element, so that's the most efficient path.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix is lower triangular except for some elements, but I don't think so because the rows below have non-zero elements beyond the diagonal.

Wait, but let's think again about the 5x5 minor. Did I make a mistake in writing it?

Original matrix after removing first row and column:

Row2: 2,7,0,0,0,0 → becomes [7,0,0,0,0]

Row3:3,8,6,0,0,0 → becomes [8,6,0,0,0]

Row4:4,9,5,2,1,4 → becomes [9,5,2,1,4]

Row5:5,8,4,0,2,5 → becomes [8,4,0,2,5]

Row6:6,7,3,0,3,6 → becomes [7,3,0,3,6]

Yes, that's correct.

Then expanding the 5x5 along first row's 7.

The 4x4 matrix comes from removing the first row and first column of the 5x5, which gives:

6 0 0 0

5 2 1 4

4 0 2 5

3 0 3 6

Expanding along first row, 6 * det(3x3).

The 3x3 is correct as well.

So the calculation seems right. So the determinant is -252, which is option H.
</think>

To determine the determinant of the given 6x6 matrix:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
2 & 7 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
3 & 8 & 6 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
4 & 9 & 5 & 2 & 1 & 4 \\
5 & 8 & 4 & 0 & 2 & 5 \\
6 & 7 & 3 & 0 & 3 & 6
\end{bmatrix},
\]

we can simplify the calculation by leveraging the structure of the matrix. The first row contains a single non-zero element (1), which allows us to expand the determinant along this row. The determinant of \(A\) is then equal to:

\[
\text{det}(A) = 1 \cdot \text{det}(M_{11}),
\]

where \(M_{11}\) is the 5x5 minor matrix obtained by removing the first row and first column of \(A\):

\[
M_{11} = \begin{bmatrix}
7 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
8 & 6 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
9 & 5 & 2 & 1 & 4 \\
8 & 4 & 0 & 2 & 5 \\
7 & 3 & 0 & 3 & 6
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Next, we compute the determinant of \(M_{11}\). The first row of \(M_{11}\) also contains a single non-zero element (7), so we expand along this row:

\[
\text{det}(M_{11}) = 7 \cdot \text{det}(M_{11}^{(1)}),
\]

where \(M_{11}^{(1)}\) is the 4x4 minor matrix obtained by removing the first row and first column of \(M_{11}\):

\[
M_{11}^{(1)} = \begin{bmatrix}
6 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
5 & 2 & 1 & 4 \\
4 & 0 & 2 & 5 \\
3 & 0 & 3 & 6
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

We now compute the determinant of \(M_{11}^{(1)}\). The first row of \(M_{11}^{(1)}\) contains a single non-zero element (6), so we expand along this row:

\[
\text{det}(M_{11}^{(1)}) = 6 \cdot \text{det}(M_{11}^{(2)}),
\]

where \(M_{11}^{(2)}\) is the 3x3 minor matrix obtained by removing the first row and first column of \(M_{11}^{(1)}\):

\[
M_{11}^{(2)} = \begin{bmatrix}
2 & 1 & 4 \\
0 & 2 & 5 \\
0 & 3 & 6
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To compute the determinant of \(M_{11}^{(2)}\), we expand along the first column, which contains two zeros:

\[
\text{det}(M_{11}^{(2)}) = 2 \cdot \text{det} \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 5 \\ 3 & 6 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The determinant of the 2x2 matrix is:

\[
\text{det} \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 5 \\ 3 & 6 \end{bmatrix} = (2 \cdot 6) - (5 \cdot 3) = 12 - 15 = -3.
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{det}(M_{11}^{(2)}) = 2 \cdot (-3) = -6.
\]

Now, backtracking the calculations:

\[
\text{det}(M_{11}^{(1)}) = 6 \cdot (-6) = -36,
\]

\[
\text{det}(M_{11}) = 7 \cdot (-36) = -252,
\]

\[
\text{det}(A) = 1 \cdot (-252) = -252.
\]

From the given options, the determinant of the matrix is \(-252\), which corresponds to option **H**.

\[
\boxed{H}
\]
