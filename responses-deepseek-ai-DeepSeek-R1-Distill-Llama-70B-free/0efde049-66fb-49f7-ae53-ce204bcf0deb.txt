Okay, so I've got this equation to solve: v minus 26 equals 68. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on algebra, but I think I can figure this out. So the equation is v - 26 = 68. I need to find the value of v that makes this equation true.

Alright, first step, I remember that to solve for a variable, I need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Here, v is being subtracted by 26. So to get v by itself, I should do the opposite operation. Since subtraction is happening, I should add 26 to both sides. That makes sense because addition undoes subtraction.

So if I add 26 to both sides, the equation becomes v - 26 + 26 = 68 + 26. Simplifying the left side, -26 and +26 cancel each other out, leaving just v. On the right side, 68 plus 26 is... let me do the math. 68 plus 20 is 88, and then plus 6 more is 94. So v equals 94.

Wait, but let me double-check that. If I substitute 94 back into the original equation, does it hold true? Let's see: 94 minus 26 should equal 68. 94 minus 20 is 74, and then minus 6 is 68. Yep, that checks out. So v is definitely 94.

Looking at the options, option E is 94. So that must be the correct answer. I think I got this right. No, wait, did I make any mistakes in my calculation? Let me go through it again. Starting with v - 26 = 68. Add 26 to both sides: v = 68 + 26. 68 plus 26 is 94. Yep, that's correct. So I'm confident that E is the right choice.

The equation to solve is \( v - 26 = 68 \). To isolate \( v \), add 26 to both sides:

\[
v - 26 + 26 = 68 + 26
\]

Simplifying:

\[
v = 94
\]

Substituting \( v = 94 \) back into the original equation confirms the solution. The correct answer is:

E: 94

Answer: E
