Okay, so I've got this question about dipole antennas, and I'm trying to figure it out. Hmm, dipole antennas... I remember that a half-wave dipole is a common type, right? The question is about calculating the length for optimal radiation at a given frequency, considering the velocity factor. 

Wait, the velocity factor is given as (A) 0.70 and (B) 1.0. I think the velocity factor is a term related to how fast the electromagnetic wave travels along the antenna, maybe? Oh right, the velocity factor (VF) or velocity of propagation is the ratio of the speed of the wave in the antenna to the speed of light in a vacuum. So VF = v/c, where v is the speed in the medium and c is the speed of light (~3e8 m/s).

The formula for a half-wave dipole's length comes to mind. I think the formula is length L = (λ/2), but wait, I'm mixing things up. Oh right, for a half-wave dipole, each arm is a quarter wavelength, so the total length is half a wavelength. Or wait, no, the full length is half a wavelength because each side is a quarter. So the basic formula is L = (λ/2).

But wait, λ is the free space wavelength. Oh, but the velocity factor affects this because the wavelength inside the antenna's material is different. So the actual physical length of the antenna would be L = (λ * VF) / 2.

Wait, let me get this straight. The free space wavelength λ0 is c/f. But when the wave is propagating in a medium, like inside the antenna's conductor, the wavelength λ becomes λ = λ0 / VF. Because the speed v = c * VF, so λ = v/f = (c * VF)/f = (c/f) * VF = λ0 * VF. Wait, no, wait: v = fλ, so λ = v/f. If v is VF * c, then λ = VF c / f. But since λ0 = c/f, then λ = VF * λ0.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The free space wavelength is λ0 = c/f. But when the wave is in a medium, the phase velocity v is c multiplied by the velocity factor. So the wavelength in the medium is λ_medium = v/f = (VF * c) / f = VF * (c/f) ) = VF * λ0.

But wait, the physical length of the antenna is determined by the wavelength in the medium, right? Because the wave is traveling along the conductor. So the actual length used in the calculation is λ_medium. But wait, no, the dipole's length depends on the free space wavelength, but the velocity factor comes into play because the wave's speed inside the conductor is less than c. So the formula for the dipole's length would be adjusted by the velocity factor.

Wait, I think the correct formula is that the length of the dipole is L = (λ / 2) * VF, but wait no, maybe it's L = (λ0 / 2) * VF. Or perhaps the other way around. Let me think.

The general formula is that the length of a half-wave dipole is approximately half the wavelength in free space. But since the antenna is made of a material with a velocity factor VF, the effective wavelength is shorter. So the physical length becomes L = (λ0 / 2) * VF.

Wait, no, because the wave slows down, the wavelength inside the material is smaller. So for a given frequency, the physical length needed is less than the free space half wavelength. So the formula might be L = (c/(f)) / (2 * VF). Wait, no, wait.

Let me get this correct. The required length is a quarter wavelength on each side, so the full length is half a wavelength. The wavelength in the medium is λ_medium = VF * λ0. So the half wavelength in the medium is (λ_medium)/2 = (VF * λ0)/2.

Wait, no, no. Let's think about it step by step. The speed of the wave is v = VF * c. The frequency is f. The wavelength in the medium is λ = v / f = (VF * c) / f.

The free space wavelength is λ0 = c / f. So λ = VF * λ0.

But for a half-wave dipole, the length should be half of the wavelength in the medium. Because the wave is traveling inside the medium of the antenna. So L = λ / 2 = (VF * λ0) / 2 = (VF * c) / (2f).

Alternatively, since λ0 = c/f, then L = (VF * λ0) / 2.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The formula for the length of a dipole antenna is given by L = (λ)/(2π) for a monopole, but dipole is two times that, so L = λ/2. But that's in free space. However, when the velocity factor comes into play, the effective wavelength is shorter.

Wait, I'm getting myself mixed up. Let me recall the formula. The standard formula for a half-wave dipole is L = (c)/(2f) ) * VF. Because the velocity factor reduces the required physical length.

Wait, maybe the formula is:

L = (λ_free_space / 2) * VF.

Because in the medium, the wavelength is λ_medium = λ_free_space * VF. So the dipole's length is a quarter wavelength in each arm, so the total length is half. So L = (λ_medium) / 2.

Wait, no. The physical length of the dipole is based on the wavelength in the medium. So each arm is a quarter wavelength in the medium, so the full length is half of the medium's wavelength.

So L = (λ_medium) / 2.

But λ_medium = (c / f) * VF. Because λ_medium = v / f, and v = VF * c. So putting it together, L = ( (VF * c) / f ) / 2.

So L = (VF * c) / (2f).

Alternatively, L = (c/(2f)) * VF.

Yes, that seems correct.

So the given frequency is 300 MHz. Let's compute the length for each case.

First, speed of light c is 3e8 m/s.

Case A: VF = 0.70.

So L_A = (0.7) * (3e8)/(2*300e6) )

Let me compute 3e8 divided by (2 * 300e6) first.

2 * 300e6 = 6e8.

3e8 / 6e8 = 0.5.

So L_A = 0.7 * 0.5 = 0.35 meters.

Case B: VF = 1.0.

So L_B = (1.0) * (3e8)/(2 * 300e6) ) = 0.5 meters.

So the lengths would be 0.35 meters and 0.5 meters. Now, looking at the options given.

Looking at the options:

Option F is 0.35 m, 0.5 m. That's our case.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 0.7 m, 1 m

B: 0.6 m, 0.9 m

C: 0.5 m, 1 m

D: 0.55 m, 0.85 m

E: 0.25 m, 0.75 m

F: 0.35 m, 0.5 m

G: 0.45 m, 0.65 m

H: 0.2 m, 0.3 m

I: 0.4 m, 0.6 m

J: 0.3 m, 0.45 m

So option F is 0.35 and 0.5, which matches our calculation.

Wait, but wait a second. Another way to think about this: the formula for a half-wave dipole is L = (1.5 * c) / (f * VF) )? No, that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I should double-check the formula.

Alternative approach: The general formula for a half-wave dipole is L = (λ)/(2), where λ is the wavelength in the medium. So λ = c/(f) * VF. So L = (c/(f)) * VF / 2.

Which is the same as (c*VF)/(2f).

So L = (3e8 m/s * 0.7) / (2 * 300e6 Hz) )

Let's compute that.

3e8 * 0.7 = 2.1e8.

2.1e8 / (2 * 300e6) = 2.1e8 / 6e8 = 0.35 meters.

Same as before. So yes, option F is correct.
</think>

To calculate the length of a half-wave dipole antenna for optimal radiation at a frequency of 300 MHz, the formula used is:

\[
L = \frac{c \cdot \text{VF}}{2f}
\]

where:
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light in a vacuum),
- \( \text{VF} \) is the velocity factor,
- \( f = 300 \, \text{MHz} = 300 \times 10^6 \, \text{Hz} \).

### Case A: \( \text{VF} = 0.70 \)
Substituting the values:
\[
L_A = \frac{(3 \times 10^8) \cdot 0.70}{2 \cdot 300 \times 10^6}
\]
\[
L_A = \frac{2.1 \times 10^8}{6 \times 10^8} = 0.35 \, \text{meters}.
\]

### Case B: \( \text{VF} = 1.0 \)
Substituting the values:
\[
L_B = \frac{(3 \times 10^8) \cdot 1.0}{2 \cdot 300 \times 10^6}
\]
\[
L_B = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{6 \times 10^8} = 0.5 \, \text{meters}.
\]

Thus, the lengths of the half-wave dipole antenna for the two cases are **0.35 meters** (for \( \text{VF} = 0.70 \)) and **0.5 meters** (for \( \text{VF} = 1.0 \)).

### Matching with the Options:
From the given options, the correct match is **Option F: 0.35 meters, 0.5 meters**.
