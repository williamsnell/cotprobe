Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the mean of a set of numbers. The numbers given are 18, 9, 9, 10, 11, 14, 30, and 19. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the mean is calculated by adding up all the numbers and then dividing by how many numbers there are. So I need to sum all these values and then divide by the count of numbers.

Let me list the numbers again to make sure I have them right: 18, 9, 9, 10, 11, 14, 30, 19. That's eight numbers in total, right? So the count is 8.

Now, I'll start adding them one by one. Maybe I can add them in pairs to make it easier. Let's see:

18 and 9: 18 + 9 is 27.

Then another 9: 27 + 9 is 36.

Plus 10: 36 +10 is 46.

Plus 11: 46 +11 is 57.

Plus 14: 57 +14 is 71.

Plus 30: 71 +30 is 101.

Plus 19: 101 +19 is 120.

Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when I add step by step, I might miss a number or add incorrectly.

Starting over:

18 +9 =27.

27 +9 =36.

36 +10 =46.

46 +11 =57.

57 +14 =71.

71 +30 =101.

101 +19 =120.

Yes, that seems correct. So the total sum is 120.

Now, since there are 8 numbers, the mean is 120 divided by 8. Let me calculate that.

120 รท8 = 15.

So the mean should be 15.

Looking at the options, option D is 15. So the correct answer should be D.

Wait a second, let me double-check the addition another way to be sure. Maybe I can group them differently.

Let's see:

18 and 30: 18+30=48.

9 and 9: 9+9=18.

10 and 19: 10+19=29.

11 and 14: 11+14=25.

Now add those totals: 48 +18 =66. 66 +29=95. 95 +25=120. Yep, same result.

So 120 divided by 8 is indeed 15. That confirms it.

The mean is calculated by summing all the numbers and dividing by the count. Adding the numbers 18, 9, 9, 10, 11, 14, 30, and 19 gives a total of 120. There are 8 numbers, so the mean is 120 รท 8 = 15. 

The correct answer is D.
