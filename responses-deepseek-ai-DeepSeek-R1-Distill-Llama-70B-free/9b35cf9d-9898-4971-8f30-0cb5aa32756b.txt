Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the reduction of chromic oxide (Cr₂O₃) with hydrogen. The equation given is Cr₂O₃ + 3H₂ → 2Cr + 3H₂O. There are three parts to this question, and I need to figure out each part step by step.

Starting with part (a): What weight of hydrogen would be required to reduce 7.6 g of Cr₂O₃? Hmm, so I think I need to find the molar masses first. Let me jot down the molar masses of the elements involved. Chromium (Cr) has a molar mass of about 52 g/mol, oxygen (O) is 16, and hydrogen (H) is 1.

So for Cr₂O₃, the molar mass is (2*52) + (3*16) = 104 + 48 = 152 g/mol. Right? And hydrogen is H₂, so each molecule is 2 g/mol.

The balanced equation shows that 1 mole of Cr₂O₃ reacts with 3 moles of H₂. So the mole ratio is 1:3. 

First, I'll find out how many moles of Cr₂O₃ are in 7.6 grams. Moles = mass / molar mass. So that's 7.6 g / 152 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 7.6 divided by 152 is... let's see, 152 goes into 7.6 about 0.05 times because 152 * 0.05 is 7.6. So that's 0.05 moles of Cr₂O₃.

Since the ratio is 1:3, the moles of H₂ needed are 3 times that, so 0.05 * 3 = 0.15 moles of H₂.

Now, to find the mass of H₂, multiply moles by molar mass. 0.15 moles * 2 g/mol = 0.3 grams. So 0.3 grams of hydrogen are needed for part (a). 

Moving on to part (b): For each mole of metallic chromium prepared, how many moles of hydrogen will be required? The equation shows that 2 moles of Cr are produced from 3 moles of H₂. So per mole of Cr, how much H₂ is needed? 

If 2 moles Cr require 3 moles H₂, then per mole Cr it's 3/2 moles H₂. So that's 1.5 moles of H₂ per mole of Cr. So part (b) is 1.5 moles.

Wait, but let me double-check. The equation is Cr₂O₃ + 3H₂ → 2Cr + 3H₂O. So for every 2 moles of Cr produced, 3 moles of H₂ are consumed. So yes, for each mole of Cr, it's 3/2 = 1.5 moles H₂. So part (b) is 1.5 moles.

Now part (c): What weight of metallic chromium can be prepared from one ton of Cr₂O₃? One ton is 1000 kg, which is 1,000,000 grams. But first, I need to find the molar relationship. 

Each mole of Cr₂O₃ produces 2 moles of Cr. So first, find moles of Cr₂O₃ in one ton. Molar mass is 152 g/mol. Moles = 1,000,000 g / 152 g/mol. Let me compute that. 1e6 / 152 is approximately 6573.684 moles of Cr₂O₃.

Each mole of Cr₂O₃ gives 2 moles of Cr, so total moles of Cr is 6573.684 * 2 = 13147.368 moles.

Now, the molar mass of Cr is 52 g/mol. So mass of Cr is 13147.368 mol * 52 g/mol. Let's calculate that. 13147 * 52. Hmm, 13147 * 50 is 657,350 and 13147 *2 is 26,294. So total is 657,350 + 26,294 = 683,644 grams? That's 683.644 kg, which is about 683.64 kilograms.

Wait, but the options are in pounds. Oh, right, the question gives 1 lb = 454 g. So I need to convert kilograms to pounds. 

Wait, 683.644 kg is equal to how many pounds? Since 1 kg is approximately 2.20462 pounds. So 683.644 kg * 2.20462 lb/kg. Let me compute that.

Approximately: 683.644 * 2 = 1367.288. 683.644 * 0.20462 ≈ let's see, 683.644 * 0.2 = 136.7288, and 683.644 * 0.00462 ≈ 3.16. So total is about 136.7288 +3.16 ≈ 139.89. So total pounds ≈ 1367.288 + 139.89 ≈ 1507.18 pounds. So approximately 1507 pounds.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option C says 1333 lbs, D is 1550, E is 1400, J is 1450. Hmm, none of the options exactly match 1507. Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error. Let me recalculate.

Wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the moles. Let me do part (c) again.

Cr₂O₃ molar mass is 152 g/mol. So 1 ton is 1,000,000 g.

Moles of Cr₂O₃ = 1e6 / 152 = approx 6573.684 moles.

Each mole gives 2 moles Cr, so 6573.684 * 2 = 13147.368 moles Cr.

Mass of Cr is 13147.368 * 52 g/mol.

13147.368 * 50 = 657,368 grams.

13147.368 * 2 = 26,294.736 grams.

Total = 657,368 +26,294.736 = 683,662.736 grams. So 683,662.736 grams is 683.662736 kg.

Convert to pounds: 683.662736 kg * 2.20462 lb/kg.

Let me calculate 683.662736 * 2 = 1367.325472 lb.

683.662736 * 0.20462 = let's compute that:

0.2 * 683.662736 = 136.732547.

0.00462 * 683.662736 = approx 683.662736 * 0.004 = 2.7346509, plus 0.00062 * 683.662736 ≈ 0.423. So total ≈ 2.73465 + 0.423 ≈ 3.15765.

So 136.732547 + 3.15765 ≈ 139.8902.

Adding to 1367.325472: 1367.325 + 139.8902 ≈ 1507.215 pounds.

So approximately 1507 pounds. Looking at the options, option D says 1550 lbs, which is close but not exact. Option A is 1500 lbs, which is the closest.

Wait, looking at the options again: option C is 1333 lbs, option D 1550, option J 1450. Hmm, none is exactly 1507. Let me check the possible miscalculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles. Let me recalculate.

1 ton is 1,000,000 grams. Moles of Cr₂O₃ = 1e6 / 152.

Let me compute 1e6 / 152:

152 * 6573 = 152 *6000=912000, 152*500=76000 → 988000. 152*73= 11,096. So 152*6573= 988000 + 11,096 = 1,000, 096. Oh, wait, wait—wait, 152 * 6573 = let me compute 152 * 6573. Maybe it's better to calculate 1e6 / 152.

1e6 / 152 = 1000000 ÷ 152. Let me compute 152 × 6573 = 1000000? Let me check:

152 × 6573.

Let me compute 6573 × 150 = 985950.

6573 × 2 = 13146.

So total 985950 +13146 = 999,096. So that's 152 × 6573 = 999,096. So 1e6 is 1,000,000. So 1e6 ÷152 is 6573 with a remainder of 904 (since 999,096 + 904 = 1,000,000). So 6573 + (904/152) = 6573 + 5.947 ≈ 6578.947 moles? Wait, wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me approach it differently.

Wait, 152 × 6573 = 999,096.

Difference from 1e6 is 904 grams.

So 904 grams is how many moles? 904 / 152 = 5.947 moles.

So total moles of Cr₂O₃ is 6573 + 5.947 ≈ 6578.947 moles.

Wait, that's a big difference from my initial calculation. So I must have made a mistake earlier. So the correct moles are approximately 6578.947.

Then, moles of Cr is 2 times that, so 6578.947 * 2 = 13,157.894 moles.

Mass of Cr is 13,157.894 moles * 52 g/mol = ?

13,157.894 * 50 = 657,894.7 g.

13,157.894 * 2 = 26,315.788 g.

Total: 657,894.7 + 26,315.788 = 684,210.488 grams. So 684.210 kg.

Convert to pounds: 684.210 kg * 2.20462 lb/kg = ?

Let me compute 684.21 * 2.20462.

Calculate 684 * 2 = 1368.

684 * 0.20462 = let's do 684 * 0.2 = 136.8; 684 * 0.00462 ≈ 3.16. So 136.8 + 3.16 = 139.96.

So 1368 + 139.96 = 1507.96 pounds. Approximately 1508 pounds.

Looking back at the options, option A is 1500 lbs, which is the closest. But wait, let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option D is 1550, which is a bit higher. Option A is 1500. Hmm. So perhaps I should re-examine the initial steps.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the initial moles. Let me compute 1,000,000 / 152 precisely.

152 × 6573 = 999,096.

1,000,000 – 999,096 = 904 grams.

So 904 g / 152 g/mol = 904 / 152 = 5.947368 moles.

So total moles = 6573 + 5.947368 = 6578.947368 moles.

Then moles of Cr = 6578.947368 × 2 = 13157.894736.

Mass of Cr = 13157.894736 × 52 = let's compute that.

13157.894736 × 50 = 657,894.73684 g.

13157.894736 × 2 = 26,315.789472 g.

Total = 657,894.73684 + 26,315.789472 = 684,210.5263 grams.

So 684,210.5263 grams is 684.2105263 kg.

Convert to pounds: 684.2105263 kg × 2.20462 lb/kg.

Compute 684.2105263 × 2.20462.

Let me compute 684.2105 * 2 = 1368.421.

684.2105 * 0.20462.

Compute 684.2105 × 0.2 = 136.8421.

684.2105 × 0.00462: Let's break it down.

0.004 × 684.2105 = 2.736842.

0.00062 × 684.2105 ≈ 0.4237.

So 2.736842 + 0.4237 ≈ 3.160542.

So 0.20462 × 684.2105 ≈ 136.8421 + 3.160542 = 139.00264.

Now add to 1368.421: 1368.421 + 139.00264 ≈ 1507.42364 pounds.

So approximately 1507.42 pounds.

Looking at the options, option D is 1550, which is higher, option A is 1500. Hmm. Not exact, but option A is 1500, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Wait, perhaps I should check another approach.

Alternative approach for part (c):

The molar ratio of Cr₂O₃ to Cr is 1:2.

Mass of Cr₂O₃ is 1 ton, which is 1e6 grams.

Molar masses: Cr₂O₃ is 152 g/mol, Cr is 52 g/mol.

So, moles of Cr₂O₃ = 1e6 / 152 ≈ 6578.947.

Moles of Cr = 2 * 6578.947 ≈ 13157.894.

Mass of Cr = 13157.894 * 52 ≈ 684210.5 grams = 684.2105 kg.

Convert kg to pounds: 684.2105 * 2.20462 ≈ 1507.42 lbs.

Now, looking at the options, the closest one is option A: 1500 lbs. But some of the other options have different numbers. Let me look again.

Wait, the options are:

A: 0.50 g, 2.5 moles, 1500 lbs

B: 0.60 g, 3.0 moles, 1600 lbs

C: 0.30 g, 1.5 moles, 1333 lbs

D: 0.45 g, 2.25 moles, 1550 lbs

E: 0.40 g, 2.0 moles, 1400 lbs

F: 0.10 g, 0.5 moles, 1350 lbs

G: 0.35 g, 1.75 moles, 1250 lbs

H: 0.15 g, 0.75 moles, 1300 lbs

I: 0.20 g, 1.0 moles, 1200 lbs

J: 0.25 g, 1.25 moles, 1450 lbs

Wait, so for part (c), option A is 1500 and D is 1550. My calculated 1507 is closer to A's 1500.

But wait, perhaps the exact calculation gives something else. Let me compute 1e6 / 152 accurately.

1e6 ÷ 152 = 1000000 / 152.

Let me compute 152 * 6578 = ?

152 * 6000 = 912000.

152 * 500 = 76000 → total 988000.

152 * 78 = let's compute 152*70=10640, 152*8=1216 → total 10640+1216=11856.

So 152*6578 = 988000 + 11856 = 999,856.

Wait, 152*6578= 999,856 grams.

So 1e6 grams - 999,856 grams = 144 grams.

So moles from 144 grams: 144 / 152 = 0.947368 moles.

So total moles of Cr₂O₃ is 6578 + 0.947368 ≈ 6578.947368.

Moles of Cr: 6578.947368 * 2 = 13157.894736.

Mass of Cr: 13157.894736 * 52 = let's compute that.

13157.894736 * 50 = 657,894.73684 grams.

13157.894736 * 2 = 26,315.789472 grams.

Total: 657,894.73684 + 26,315.789472 = 684,210.52631 grams.

Which is 684.21052631 kg.

Convert to pounds: 684.21052631 kg * 2.20462 lb/kg.

Let me compute 684.21052631 * 2.20462.

Breaking it down:

First, 684.2105 * 2 = 1368.421.

Then, 684.2105 * 0.20462.

Compute 0.2 * 684.2105 = 136.8421.

0.00462 * 684.2105 ≈ let's calculate 684.2105 * 0.004 = 2.736842, and 684.2105 * 0.00062 ≈ 0.4243707. So total ≈ 2.736842 + 0.4243707 ≈ 3.1612127.

So 0.20462 * 684.2105 ≈ 136.8421 + 3.1612127 ≈ 140.0033.

Now, add to 1368.421: 1368.421 + 140.0033 ≈ 1508.4243 pounds.

So approximately 1508.42 pounds.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A: 1500 lbs. But wait, option D is 1550. Hmm. None of the options exactly match 1508, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, perhaps the initial question has different numbers. Let me check the question again.

Wait, part (c) says "one ton of Cr₂O₃". Oh, wait, one ton is 2000 pounds, but wait, the conversion given is 1 lb = 454 g. So perhaps I should have converted one ton to grams correctly.

Wait, one ton is 2000 pounds. So 2000 * 454 grams = 908,000 grams? Wait no, wait. Wait, no, the question says 1 lb = 454 g, but one ton is 1000 kg, which is 1,000,000 grams. So that's correct. So my earlier approach is correct.

Hmm. Perhaps the correct answer for part (c)
