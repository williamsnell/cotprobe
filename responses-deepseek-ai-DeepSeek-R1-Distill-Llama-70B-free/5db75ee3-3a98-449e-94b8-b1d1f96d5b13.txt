Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about sexual addiction. The question is asking what experiences a sexual addict has after completing a sexual act. The options are from A to J.

First, I should understand what sexual addiction entails. From what I remember, sexual addiction is a compulsive behavior where a person engages in sexual activities despite negative consequences. It's similar to other addictions, like substance abuse, where the person can't control their actions and might feel a cycle of craving, acting out, and then some negative emotions afterward.

So, when someone completes the sexual act, what happens next? I think in addiction cycles, there's often a crash or a comedown. For example, with drugs, people might feel euphoric during use but then crash afterward, leading to feelings of guilt or depression.

Looking at the options:

A: Starts planning the next act. That makes sense because addicts often have compulsive behavior, so they might immediately think about the next time.

B: Feels ashamed and regrets. This also sounds plausible because after the high, there's often guilt.

C: Feels indifferent. Maybe, but not sure if that's common in addiction. More likely, they feel strong emotions, not indifference.

D: Uses the fantasy to get aroused again. That could be part of the cycle, using the recent act as a new fantasy.

E: Forgets and moves on. Doesn't fit with addiction, since they're usually preoccupied.

F: Feels love and connection. Probably not, since the addiction is more about the act than emotional bonding.

G: Hopelessness and despair. This could be part of the crash after the high.

H: Euphoria and excitement. That's more during the act, not after.

I: Relaxed and relieved. Maybe temporarily, but then other feelings might set in.

J: Becomes aroused again and feels good. That might not happen immediately; perhaps after some time.

Wait, I think in the cycle of addiction, after the act, there's a phase where the person feels guilt, shame, or regret. So option B seems correct. But I've also heard that sometimes they might immediately start planning the next time because the addiction is so strong. So option A is also a possibility.

Alternatively, some sources mention that after acting out, the addict might feel a range of negative emotions, including shame, regret, and even hopelessness. So B and G are possible.

But the question is about the immediate experience after completing the act. So maybe right after, the person might feel a temporary relief, but then quickly feel bad. Or perhaps the crash happens immediately.

Wait, another angle: in the addiction cycle, the process usually is: preoccupation (fantasizing), ritual (planning), compulsive engagement (the act), and then despair (after). So after the act, the person enters the despair phase, which includes feelings of guilt, shame, regret, hopelessness.

So looking back at the options, B is about shame and regret, and G is about hopelessness and despair. So both B and G could be correct.

But the question is in the singular—what are the experiences, so maybe the answer includes one of these.

Alternatively, perhaps the immediate experience after the act is a crash, leading to negative emotions. So B and G are both related. But looking at the options, which one is more commonly cited.

In some materials I've read, after the high of the addiction, the person often feels shame and regret. So option B might be the answer.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes after the act, the person might quickly feel the need to do it again. So option A, where they start planning the next act. But this might be part of the cycle, not the immediate emotional experience.

Alternatively, option D says using the fantasy to become aroused again. That could tie into the planning phase.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn. But I think the emotional experience after the act is more about negative feelings. So option B or G.

Wait, the question is about the "experiences"—so it's possible that multiple feelings occur, but each option is a separate choice.

In the context of sexual addiction, after the act, the person might feel a mix of emotions, but the most commonly discussed ones are shame and regret. So I'm leaning towards option B.

Alternatively, some models suggest that after the act, the addict might continue to use sexual fantasies to arousal, which would be option D.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The sexual addiction cycle typically goes:

1. Trigger (stress, anxiety, etc.)

2. Fantasy (sexual thoughts)

3. Ritual (planning or preparing for the act)

4. Acting out (engaging in the sexual behavior)

5. Then comes the remorse or despair phase, where they feel guilt, shame, etc.

So after the act, the next phase is feeling bad. So option B.

But another possibility is that right after the act, the person might feel a temporary sense of relief or even a 'high', but that doesn't fit because the options are about after the act.

Wait, option H is about feeling euphoric, which is probably during the act. So after, it's more like crash.

Therefore, option B: feels ashamed and regrets their behavior.

Wait, but I also remember that sometimes after acting out, the addict might immediately start planning the next time to get that high again. So option A.

Hmm. So which is more correct?

I think in some cases, immediately after, they might feel relief, but then quickly feel bad. Or perhaps, depending on the individual, they might start planning again to avoid the negative feelings.

But the question is about the experiences when they've completed the act. So it's more about the emotional state after.

I think the most common experience is feeling ashamed and regretful, so option B is the answer.

The question asks about the experiences of a sexual addict immediately after completing a sexual act. To answer this, it's important to consider the typical cycle of sexual addiction, which often includes preoccupation, ritual, acting out, and then a phase of remorse or despair. 

After the act, the individual may experience a range of emotions, but the most commonly cited feelings are negative ones such as shame, guilt, and regret. This aligns with the remorse phase of the addiction cycle, where the person reflects on their behavior and feels remorseful. 

While other options, such as immediately planning the next act (A) or using fantasies to become aroused again (D), might occur as part of the cycle, the question specifically focuses on the emotional experiences immediately following the act. Among the options provided, feeling ashamed and regretful (B) best captures the emotional state typically associated with this phase.

Answer: B
