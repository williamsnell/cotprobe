Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the energy of a hydrogen atom in its ground state using the mass of the electron instead of the reduced mass. Hmm, I remember that the energy levels of the hydrogen atom are given by the Bohr model. The formula I think is E_n = - (mu * e^4) / (8 epsilon_0^2 h^2) multiplied by 1/(n²), but I'm not entirely sure. Oh wait, I think the standard formula uses the reduced mass mu of the system, which is the electron and proton together.

Wait, right! The reduced mass mu is (m_e * M_p) / (m_e + M_p), where m_e is the electron mass and M_p is the proton mass. But in this question, they're telling me to use the mass of the electron instead of the reduced mass. So I guess I should substitute mu with just m_e.

The ground state is n=1, so the energy should be the lowest, which is the most negative. The usual energy for n=1 using reduced mass is about -13.6 eV, I remember that number. But when using m_e instead of mu, I need to see how that affects the energy.

So, the energy formula is proportional to the reduced mass. If I replace mu with m_e, which is a bit smaller than mu (since mu is m_e/(1 + m_e/M_p), approximately m_e because M_p is much larger), then the energy will be a bit more negative than the usual -13.6 eV. Because if mu increases, the energy becomes more negative. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The reduced mass mu is less than m_e because mu = m_e * M_p / (m_e + M_p) ≈ m_e (since M_p >> m_e). So normally, mu is about m_e. So substituting mu with m_e... actually, that's what I'm doing. So does that mean the energy becomes more negative than -13.6 eV?

Let me write the usual formula. The energy is E = - (mu e^4)/(8 epsilon_0^2 h^2) * 1/(2 n²). Wait, n is 1 here, so 1/(2 *1^2) would be 1/2. Wait, or is it without the 2? I'm a bit confused. Let me get the exact formula.

Oh wait, the standard formula is E_n = - (m_e e^4)/(8 epsilon_0^2 h^2) * 1/(2 n²). Or wait, no. Because actually, the reduced mass comes into play because the nucleus isn't stationary. So the energy expression with reduced mass is E_n = - (mu e^4)/(8 epsilon_0^2 h^2) * 1/(2 n²). Wait, no, I think the exact formula is E_n = - (mu e^4) / (8 epsilon_0^2 h^2) * (1/(n²)).

Alternatively, another way I've seen it is E_n = - (13.6 eV) * (mu/m_e) * (1/n²). Because the standard value is when mu is roughly m_e, so it's about -13.6 eV. But if mu is actually m_e, then E_n would be -13.6 eV times (m_e/mu). Wait, no, because mu is less than m_e. Wait, mu = m_e / (1 + m_e/M_p) ≈ m_e (1 - m_e/M_p) when m_e << M_p. So if I use m_e instead of mu, then the energy would be E = -13.6 eV * (m_e/mu) ≈ -13.6 eV * (1/(1 - m_e/M_p)) ≈ approximately, since m_e/M_p is very small, it's about 1 plus a tiny amount. So the energy becomes a bit more negative. Hmm, but wait, the question is asking to calculate the energy using the mass of the electron rather than the reduced mass. So perhaps the calculation would give a slightly different value than -13.6 eV. But looking at the options, option A is -13.61 eV, which is very close to the standard value.

Wait, but when you use the reduced mass, the energy is -13.6 eV. If you use m_e instead of mu, which is a bit smaller, then the energy (which is proportional to mu) would be higher, i.e., less negative. So instead of -13.6 eV, it would be a bit higher, like maybe around -13.6 times (m_e/mu).

Wait, what's the value of mu? Let me calculate that. m_e is approximately 9.109e-31 kg, and M_p is about 1.67e-27 kg. So mu = (m_e * M_p) / (m_e + M_p) ≈ m_e * [1 / (1 + m_e/M_p)]. Since m_e/M_p is about 5.446e-4, which is much less than 1, so mu ≈ m_e * (1 - m_e/M_p). So mu is slightly less than m_e. Therefore, when I use m_e instead of mu, the energy becomes E = -13.6 eV * (mu/m_e). Because the standard E is proportional to mu. So E = -13.6 eV * (mu/m_e) = -13.6 eV * [m_e/(m_e + M_p)] / (m_e) ) = -13.6 eV * (1/(1 + m_e/M_p)).

So m_e/M_p is about 0.0005446. So 1/(1 + 0.0005446) ≈ 0.9994554. So E ≈ -13.6 eV * 0.999455 ≈ approximately -13.59 eV. So using m_e instead of mu would give a slightly less negative energy than the standard -13.6 eV. Wait, the standard E is -13.6 eV when using mu. So if I use m_e instead, the energy is more positive, i.e., less negative, so higher in energy.

Wait, that's confusing. Let me clarify. The standard energy (using reduced mass) is E = -13.6 eV. If I replace mu with m_e, which is larger (since mu ≈ m_e (1 - m_e/M_p)), then the energy E' = - (m_e/mu) * 13.6 eV. Because E is proportional to mu, so E' = (m_e/mu) * E. Since m_e > mu, E' is more negative than E. Wait no, because E is already proportional to mu. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the formula for energy is E = - Ry * (mu/m_e) * Z² / n², where Ry is the Rydberg constant (~13.6 eV). So for hydrogen, Z is 1, n is 1. So E = -13.6 eV * (mu/m_e). So when mu is the reduced mass, it's less than m_e, so the energy is a bit more positive than -13.6 eV? Wait, that can't be. Because the reduced mass is a bit less than m_e, so (mu/m_e) is less than 1, so E would be a little more positive than -13.6 eV. But I thought the standard value was -13.6 eV. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, maybe the standard formula already uses the reduced mass. So the usual E is already calculated with mu. So if I instead use m_e, the energy becomes E' = - Ry * (m_e / m_e) * (1/n²) = - Ry / n². So it's -13.6 eV when m_e is used. But that can't be right because the standard calculation uses mu. So perhaps the standard E is E = - (mu/m_e) * 13.6 eV. So using m_e, E would be -13.6 eV.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me approach this differently. The standard formula for the ground state energy of hydrogen (n=1) is E = -13.6 eV, using the reduced mass. So if I don't use the reduced mass and instead use the electron's mass, the energy would be different. So how much different?

The Rydberg constant R is given by R = (m_e e^4)/(8 epsilon_0^2 h^3 c), but wait, perhaps it's more accurate to think in terms of the reduced mass. Alternatively, another approach: the ground state energy is given by E = - (m_e e^4)/(8 epsilon_0^2 h^2) * 1/(2), because n=1. Wait, no, the actual formula is E_n = - (m_e e^4)/(8 epsilon_0^2 h^2) * 1/(2 n²). So for n=1, E = - (m_e e^4)/(8 epsilon_0^2 h^2) * 1/2.

Wait, but when considering the two-body problem (electron and proton), the energy becomes E = - (mu e^4)/(8 epsilon_0^2 h^2) * 1/(2 n²). So if I replace mu with m_e, then E' = - (m_e e^4)/(8 epsilon_0^2 h^2) * 1/(2). But the standard E already uses mu, so the usual E is -13.6 eV. So if I use m_e instead, since mu is approximately m_e (a tiny bit less), E' would be a bit more negative than -13.6 eV.

Wait, but wait, no, because mu is less than m_e. So when you use m_e instead of mu, the energy becomes E' = (m_e / mu) * E. Because E is proportional to mu. So E' = E * (m_e / mu). Since m_e > mu, E' is more negative than E.

So the standard E is -13.6 eV when using mu. So E' would be -13.6 eV * (m_e/mu). What's m_e/mu? Since mu = (m_e M_p)/(m_e + M_p) ≈ m_e (1 - m_e/M_p), then m_e/mu ≈ 1/(1 - m_e/M_p) ≈ 1 + m_e/M_p. So m_e/mu is approximately 1 + 5.446e-4 ≈ 1.0005446. So E' ≈ -13.6 eV * 1.0005446 ≈ -13.607 eV.

Looking at the options, option A is -13.61 eV, which is very close to this value. So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but wait another thing. The options include other units besides eV. For example, option C is in joules. So maybe the question expects the energy in joules when using m_e? No, the question states to calculate using the mass of the electron, but the options include A as -13.61eV, which is almost the standard value but a bit more precise.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The standard energy when using reduced mass is about -13.6 eV. If the question asks to use m_e instead, the energy would be very slightly more negative, around -13.61 eV. So option A is the answer.

To calculate the energy of a hydrogen atom in its ground state (n = 1) using the mass of the electron instead of the reduced mass, we start with the formula for the energy levels of hydrogen:

\[
E_n = -\frac{\mu e^4}{8 \epsilon_0^2 h^2} \cdot \frac{1}{n^2},
\]

where \(\mu\) is the reduced mass of the system, given by:

\[
\mu = \frac{m_e M_p}{m_e + M_p},
\]

with \(m_e\) being the mass of the electron and \(M_p\) the mass of the proton. Normally, \(\mu\) is slightly less than \(m_e\) because \(M_p \gg m_e\), so \(\mu \approx m_e \left(1 - \frac{m_e}{M_p}\right)\).

If we instead use \(m_e\) directly in place of \(\mu\), the energy becomes:

\[
E_n = -\frac{m_e e^4}{8 \epsilon_0^2 h^2} \cdot \frac{1}{n^2}.
\]

The standard ground state energy (\(n = 1\)) using the reduced mass is approximately \(-13.6 \, \text{eV}\). When using \(m_e\) instead of \(\mu\), the energy becomes slightly more negative because \(m_e > \mu\). Specifically, the energy scales as:

\[
E' = E \cdot \frac{m_e}{\mu}.
\]

Since \(\mu \approx m_e \left(1 - \frac{m_e}{M_p}\right)\), we have:

\[
\frac{m_e}{\mu} \approx 1 + \frac{m_e}{M_p}.
\]

Given that \(\frac{m_e}{M_p} \approx 5.446 \times 10^{-4}\), the correction factor is very small, and the energy becomes approximately \(-13.61 \, \text{eV}\), which is slightly more negative than the standard value.

Among the options provided, the closest match to this calculation is:

**A: -13.61 eV.**

Thus, the correct answer is:

**A**
