Alright, so I have this problem about taxicabs and their mileage. Let me see if I can figure it out step by step. Okay, the question is about probability using a normal distribution. Hmm, I remember that normal distributions are bell-shaped and have certain properties, like the mean and standard deviation.

The problem says that the average miles driven per year by taxicabs is 75,000 with a standard deviation of 12,000. So, the mean (μ) is 75,000, and σ is 12,000. We need to find the probability that a randomly selected cab has been driven less than 100,000 miles, given that it's already known to have been driven over 80,000 miles. Oh, wait, that's a conditional probability question.

So, the formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B). In this case, event A is the cab being driven less than 100,000 miles, and event B is it being driven over 80,000 miles. So we're looking for P(miles < 100,000 | miles > 80,000) which equals P(80,000 < miles < 100,000) divided by P(miles > 80,000).

Wait, but maybe I can think of this in terms of Z-scores. Since the distribution is normal, I can convert the miles into Z-scores to find probabilities. Z = (X - μ)/σ.

Let me first find the Z-scores for 80,000 and 100,000.

For 80,000:
Z1 = (80000 - 75000) / 12000 = 5000 / 12000 ≈ 0.4167.

For 100,000:
Z2 = (100000 - 75000) / 12000 = 25000 / 12000 ≈ 2.0833.

So, the probability we're looking for is the area between Z=0.4167 and Z=2.0833 divided by the area to the right of Z=0.4167 (since P(miles>80k) is the right tail starting at Z=0.4167).

Wait, no. Wait, the conditional probability is P(A and B)/P(B). Since A is a subset of B when B is miles >80k and A is miles <100k, then P(A and B) is P(80k < X < 100k). So, it's the area between 80k and 100k divided by the area to the right of 80k.

So, I need to compute two things:

1. The probability that X is between 80k and 100k (which is P(80k < X < 100k)).
2. The probability that X is greater than 80k (P(X > 80k)).

Then, divide 1 by 2 to get the conditional probability.

Using the standard normal distribution table (Z-table), I can find the probabilities corresponding to Z1 and Z2.

First, let's compute P(X < 100k) and P(X < 80k). Then, the area between 80k and 100k is P(X < 100k) - P(X < 80k). Similarly, P(X > 80k) is 1 - P(X < 80k).

Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, P(80k < X < 100k) is equal to Φ(Z2) - Φ(Z1), where Φ is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution. And P(X > 80k) is 1 - Φ(Z1).

So, let's compute Φ(Z1) and Φ(Z2).

Z1 is approximately 0.4167. Looking up Z=0.41 in the Z-table: Φ(0.41) is about 0.6591. For Z=0.4167, let's see, 0.4167 is 0.41 + 0.0067. The exact value might be a bit higher. Alternatively, using a calculator, but perhaps I can estimate.

Wait, maybe I should use more precise values. Let me think: Z=0.4167 is the same as 5/12, which is approximately 0.4167.

Looking up Z=0.41 gives 0.6591, Z=0.42 is 0.6628. So 0.4167 is between 0.41 and 0.42. Let's approximate Φ(0.4167) by linear interpolation. The difference between 0.41 and 0.42 in the Z-table is 0.6628 - 0.6591 = 0.0037. So from 0.41 to 0.4167 is 0.0067 of the way from 0.41 to 0.42 (since 0.4167 - 0.41 = 0.0067, and 0.42-0.41=0.01). So 0.0067 / 0.01 = 0.67 of the way. So the increase in Φ is 0.67 * 0.0037 ≈ 0.0025. So Φ(0.4167) ≈ 0.6591 + 0.0025 = 0.6616.

Similarly, Z2 is 2.0833. Let's look up Z=2.08 and Z=2.09.

Z=2.08: Φ=0.9812. Z=2.09: Φ=0.9816. So 2.0833 is about 2.08 + 0.0033. The difference between Z=2.08 and Z=2.09 is 0.0004 per 0.01 Z. So 0.0033 * (0.0004/0.01) = 0.0033 * 0.04 = 0.000132. So Φ(2.0833) ≈ 0.9812 + 0.000132 ≈ 0.9813.

So now, P(X < 100k) is Φ(2.0833) ≈ 0.9813.

P(X < 80k) is Φ(0.4167) ≈ 0.6616.

So P(80k < X < 100k) is 0.9813 - 0.6616 = 0.3197.

Now, P(X > 80k) is 1 - P(X <80k) = 1 - 0.6616 = 0.3384.

So the conditional probability is 0.3197 / 0.3384 ≈ let's compute that. 0.3197 ÷ 0.3384.

Let me compute 0.3197 / 0.3384.

Well, 0.3384 * 0.94 = 0.3384 * 0.9 = 0.3046; 0.3384 * 0.04 = 0.013536. So 0.30456 + 0.013536 = 0.318096. That's close to 0.3197. So 0.94 would give 0.3384 * 0.94 = 0.318096, which is a bit less than 0.3197. The difference is 0.3197 - 0.318096 = 0.001604. So how much more than 0.94 do we need?

We have 0.3197 = 0.3384 * x.

So x = 0.3197 / 0.3384 ≈ 0.3197 / 0.3384 ≈ 0.945.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

0.3384 × 0.945:

0.3 * 0.945 = 0.2835
0.0384 * 0.945: 0.03 * 0.945=0.02835; 0.0084 *0.945≈0.007953. So total ≈0.02835+0.007953≈0.036303. So total is 0.2835 +0.036303≈0.3198. Oh wait, that's exactly our numerator, 0.3197. So 0.3384 * 0.945 ≈0.3198, which is very close to 0.3197. So x is approximately 0.945.

So the conditional probability is approximately 0.945, which is about 0.94. Looking at the options, option E is 0.94. So the answer should be E.

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the conditional probability \( P(X < 100,000 \mid X > 80,000) \), where \( X \) represents the miles driven by a taxicab. This is given by:

\[
P(X < 100,000 \mid X > 80,000) = \frac{P(80,000 < X < 100,000)}{P(X > 80,000)}.
\]

### Step 1: Convert miles to Z-scores
The normal distribution has a mean \( \mu = 75,000 \) and a standard deviation \( \sigma = 12,000 \). The Z-score is calculated as:

\[
Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}.
\]

For \( X = 80,000 \):
\[
Z_1 = \frac{80,000 - 75,000}{12,000} = \frac{5,000}{12,000} \approx 0.4167.
\]

For \( X = 100,000 \):
\[
Z_2 = \frac{100,000 - 75,000}{12,000} = \frac{25,000}{12,000} \approx 2.0833.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate probabilities using the standard normal distribution
Using the standard normal distribution table (Z-table):

- \( P(X < 80,000) = \Phi(Z_1) \), where \( Z_1 \approx 0.4167 \). From the Z-table, \( \Phi(0.4167) \approx 0.6616 \).
- \( P(X < 100,000) = \Phi(Z_2) \), where \( Z_2 \approx 2.0833 \). From the Z-table, \( \Phi(2.0833) \approx 0.9813 \).

The probability that \( 80,000 < X < 100,000 \) is:

\[
P(80,000 < X < 100,000) = \Phi(Z_2) - \Phi(Z_1) = 0.9813 - 0.6616 = 0.3197.
\]

The probability that \( X > 80,000 \) is:

\[
P(X > 80,000) = 1 - \Phi(Z_1) = 1 - 0.6616 = 0.3384.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the conditional probability
The conditional probability is:

\[
P(X < 100,000 \mid X > 80,000) = \frac{P(80,000 < X < 100,000)}{P(X > 80,000)} = \frac{0.3197}{0.3384} \approx 0.945.
\]

### Step 4: Match with the closest option
The closest option to 0.945 is **0.94**, which corresponds to **option E**.
