Okay, so I have this question about availability of a software product, and I need to figure it out. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my reliability engineering, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says the product has a mean time between failures (MTBF) of 10,000 hours and a mean time to repair (MTTR) of 20 hours. There are 100 customers using it. I need to find its availability.

Wait, availability... I remember that availability is a measure of how much time a system is operational compared to the total time it should be. So the formula probably involves MTBF and MTTR somehow.

Oh right! The formula for availability when you have repairable systems is availability = MTBF / (MTBF + MTTR). Because availability is the uptime divided by the total time, which includes both uptime and downtime.

So plugging in the numbers, MTBF is 10,000 hours, MTTR is 20. So MTBF + MTTR is 10,020 hours. Then availability is 10,000 / 10,020.

Let me calculate that. 10,000 divided by 10,020. Hmm, okay, let's do the division. 10,000 divided by 10,020 is approximately 0.998... because 10,000 divided by 10,000 is 1, and 20 is a small addition, so it's just slightly less than 1.

Wait, 0.998 is 99.8% availability. So looking at the options, I need to find which option is around 99.8%.

Looking at the options:

A: 90% → No.

B: 97% → No.

C: 100% → No, unless the system never fails, which it does.

D:75% → No.

E:85% → No.

F:99% → Hmm, close but wait.

G:80% → No.

H:95% → No.

I:98% → No.

J:99.80% → Yes, that's exactly what I calculated.

Wait, but wait a minute. The question mentions that there are 100 customers. Does that affect the calculation? I'm not sure. Because availability is typically a system-level metric, not dependent on the number of users unless we're considering something like system capacity or user-induced failures. But in this question, the MTBF and MTTR are given, which are system parameters. So the number of customers might be a red herring here, or perhaps part of a more complex calculation?

Wait, another thought: Availability can sometimes be calculated for a system with multiple units, but that's when you have parallel systems or something. But in this case, it's just a single software product used by 100 customers. But each customer using it doesn’t change the MTBF or MTTR of the system itself. So maybe the number of customers doesn't affect the availability of the product. So the initial calculation holds.

So the answer should be 99.8%, which is option J.
</think>

To determine the availability of the software product, we use the formula for availability of a repairable system:

\[
\text{Availability} = \frac{\text{MTBF}}{\text{MTBF} + \text{MTTR}}
\]

Here, the mean time between failures (MTBF) is 10,000 hours, and the mean time to repair (MTTR) is 20 hours. Substituting these values:

\[
\text{Availability} = \frac{10,000}{10,000 + 20} = \frac{10,000}{10,020} \approx 0.998
\]

This corresponds to an availability of approximately 99.8%. The number of customers (100) does not affect the calculation because availability is a system-level metric and depends only on MTBF and MTTR.

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**J: 99.80%**
