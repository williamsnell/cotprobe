Alright, so I have this logic problem here, and I need to figure out which of the given options is an immediate consequence of the premises. Okay, let's break it down step by step.

The premises are:
1. U ⊃ W
2. W ⊃ (X ≡ ~Y)
3. (X ≡ ~Y) ⊃ Z
4. ~Z

And the options are from A to J. I need to find which one follows directly from these premises in one step.

Hmm, immediate consequence usually means that it's directly derivable without needing multiple steps. So, probably using modus ponens or tollens, or maybe some other one-step rule.

Let me look at each premise. The first is U implies W. So if U is true, then W must be true. The second is W implies (X is equivalent to not Y). So if W is true, then X and ~Y are equivalent. The third is that equivalence implying Z. So if X ≡ ~Y, then Z is true. The fourth is not Z, so Z is false.

Wait, the fourth premise is ~Z. So that means Z is false. Now, looking at the third premise, (X ≡ ~Y) ⊃ Z. If Z is false, then the antecedent must be false for the implication to hold. Because in an implication, if the consequent is false, the antecedent must be false. So from ~Z, using modus tollens on the third premise, we can infer that ~(X ≡ ~Y). So that would be the negation of (X equivalent to ~Y). 

So, if I have that, then ~ (X ≡ ~Y) is true. Now, looking at the second premise, which is W ⊃ (X ≡ ~Y). So if W is true, then X ≡ ~Y. But we now know that X ≡ ~Y is false. So, from the second premise, if W were true, it would lead to a contradiction because X ≡ ~Y is false. Therefore, W must be false. Because if W were true, it would imply something false, which can't happen. So, using modus tollens on the second premise, since the consequent is false, the antecedent must be false. So ~W.

Wait, that's a lot. Let me make sure. So starting from ~Z, using the third premise (which is (X ≡ ~Y) → Z), we apply modus tollens, which gives us ~ (X ≡ ~Y). Then, using the second premise (W → (X ≡ ~Y)), and knowing that (X ≡ ~Y) is false, we apply modus tollens again to get ~W. So that's two steps. But the question is about an immediate consequence, so perhaps only one step is allowed.

Wait, but in the premises, we have four lines. So maybe we can chain some together. Let me think. Since the fourth premise is ~Z, and the third premise is (X ≡ ~Y) → Z, combining these two, we can immediately conclude ~(X ≡ ~Y), right? Because if (A → B) and ~B are both true, then ~A must be true. So that's one step.

So, from premises 3 and 4, we get ~(X ≡ ~Y). Then, looking at premise 2, which is W → (X ≡ ~Y). Since we've derived that (X ≡ ~Y) is false, applying modus tollens to premise 2 gives us ~W. So that's another step. So that's two steps, but the question is about an immediate consequence, which I think refers to one step.

Wait, but sometimes in logic, especially in systems like PL, you can have derived rules or maybe use hypothetical syllogism or other rules to combine premises. Let me think about the options given.

Looking at the options, option C is ~W. So that seems to be the conclusion we'd reach after two steps. But the question is about an immediate consequence. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Alternatively, maybe we can look for contraposition or other immediate inferences. Let me see. The fourth premise is ~Z. The third premise is (X≡~Y)→Z. So, contrapositive of that would be ~Z → ~(X≡~Y). Which is exactly what we did. So that's one step: from 3 and 4, we get ~(X≡~Y).

Then, looking at premise 2: W → (X≡~Y). So if W implies something that's false, then W must be false. So that's another step, giving us ~W. But again, that's two steps.

Wait, but maybe that's considered a one-step consequence when considering all premises together. Or perhaps the question allows using any of the premises in a single step.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is to look for subcontraposition or other rules. Let me think: The premises are:

1. U→W
2. W→(X≡~Y)
3. (X≡~Y)→Z
4. ~Z

From 3 and 4, we get ~(X≡~Y) via modus tollens. Then, from 2 and this result, we get ~W via modus tollens again. So that's two steps, but maybe in the context of the question, it's considered an immediate consequence because it's straightforward.

Looking at the options, option C is ~W. So that's one of the choices. Is that the correct answer?

Alternatively, perhaps I should check the options again. Let me see:

A: ~W ∨ Z
B: U→Z
C: ~W
D: ~U
E: U∨W
F: ~(U→W)
G: Z∨W
H: ~Z→W
I: ~(X≡~Y)
J: (X≡~Y)∨Z

So, the immediate consequence I derived is ~(X≡~Y), which is option I. But wait, the question is about an immediate consequence of the given premises. So perhaps that's an option, but let me see.

Wait, from premises 3 and 4, yes, we can directly infer ~(X≡~Y). So that would be option I. But then, from that and premise 2, we get ~W (option C). So the immediate consequence would be option I, but maybe the question allows for combining multiple premises in one step.

Alternatively, the question might be considering the entire set of premises and what can be concluded in one step from them, perhaps using hypothetical syllogism or other rules.

Wait, another approach: Let's see if we can derive any of the options directly. For example, can we get ~W?

Yes, because from premise 2, W→(X≡~Y), and we've derived that ~(X≡~Y), so by modus tollens, we get ~W. So that's a one-step consequence from premises 2 and the derived ~(X≡~Y). But wait, the derived statement itself comes from premises 3 and 4. So perhaps combining all of them, but in terms of one step from the premises given.

Wait, but in propositional logic, each step is an application of a rule. So to get ~(X≡~Y), that's one step from 3 and 4. Then, to get ~W, that's another step from 2 and the first conclusion. So that's two steps. But the question asks for an immediate consequence, which I think refers to a single step.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option I, which is ~(X≡~Y), because that's directly from premises 3 and 4.

But looking back, the premises are given, and we can use any number of them in a single step. So, perhaps we can combine them to get ~W in one step.

Wait, let's think about it. From premise 3: (X≡~Y)→Z. Premise 4 is ~Z. So, from these two, we can conclude ~(X≡~Y) via modus tollens. So that's one step, giving us option I.

Then, from premise 2: W→(X≡~Y), and we have ~(X≡~Y), so by modus tollens again, we get ~W. So that's a second step.

So, the immediate consequence (one step) would be option I. But the options don't include ~(X≡~Y) as an option beyond I, which is option I. Wait, looking back, option I is ~(X≡~Y), yes.

But wait, the question is asking which proposition is an immediate consequence of the given premises. So, perhaps the immediate consequence is ~W, because it's derived from two steps, but maybe in the context of the question, it's considered a one-step consequence when considering all the premises together.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option C, ~W, because it's the most direct conclusion, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, let me think again. The question is about an immediate consequence, which is a one-step inference. So, from the premises, can I get any of the options in one step?

Option C is ~W. To get ~W, I need to apply modus tollens to premise 2, which requires that (X≡~Y) is false. But do I have that as a premise? No, but I can derive it in one step from premises 3 and 4.

Wait, but to derive ~W, I need to first derive ~(X≡~Y), which is from 3 and 4, and then use that with 2. So that's two steps. So, perhaps the immediate consequence is ~(X≡~Y), which is option I, and then from that, you can get ~W.

But the question is about the immediate consequence, so perhaps the answer is option I.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is ~W, and that's a possible conclusion, but it's two steps from the premises. The question is whether it's an immediate consequence, which I think refers to a single step.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option B: U⊃Z. Let me check. From the premises, can I derive U→Z? Well, U→W (premise 1), W→(X≡~Y) (premise 2), which leads to U→(X≡~Y) via hypothetical syllogism. Then, (X≡~Y)→Z (premise 3), so by hypothetical syllogism again, U→Z. So that's two steps. But again, it's more than one step.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option C, ~W, because from premises 2,3,4, you can derive it in two steps, but is that considered immediate? Maybe the question considers that as an immediate consequence.

Wait, another angle: Let's consider all the premises together. Since we have ~Z, and (X≡~Y)→Z, we can conclude ~(X≡~Y). Then, from W→(X≡~Y), we conclude ~W. So, combining these, perhaps the immediate consequence is ~W.

But again, that's two steps. Unless we can combine them into a single step.

Wait, perhaps using the rule of transposition or contraposition. Let me think: From W→(X≡~Y) and ~(X≡~Y), we can infer ~W in one step via modus tollens. But to get ~(X≡~Y), we needed to use the third and fourth premises. So, perhaps in one step, combining premises 2,3,4, we can get ~W.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option C, ~W.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to approach it differently. Let's assume each option and see which one can be derived directly.

Option C: ~W. To derive this, we need a premise that leads to it. We have W→(X≡~Y), and we have ~(X≡~Y), so modus tollens gives us ~W. So that's one step, but the ~(X≡~Y) comes from another step. So, perhaps in the context of the question, the answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option I, ~(X≡~Y), which is directly from premises 3 and 4.

But the question is about the immediate consequence of the given premises, and perhaps any of them can be used together. So, from the four premises, which one can we get in one step.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to see if any of the options can be derived using only one premise. For example, from U→W, can any option be derived? Not directly. From W→(X≡~Y), same thing. From (X≡~Y)→Z, same. From ~Z, same.

So, probably, the immediate consequence comes from combining two premises.

So, from premise 3 and 4, we get ~(X≡~Y), which is option I. That's one step. So that's an immediate consequence.

But then, from premise 2 and this conclusion, we get ~W, which is option C. So that's a second step.

So, the immediate consequence would be option I, but the question is about which proposition is an immediate consequence, so perhaps option I is correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the question gives four premises, and perhaps we can combine more than two at once. Let me think: We have ~Z, which is the negation of Z. The third premise is (X≡~Y)→Z. So, from these two, we can get ~(X≡~Y). Then, from premise 2, W→(X≡~Y), and since we have ~(X≡~Y), we can get ~W. So, perhaps in one step, combining premises 2,3,4, we can get ~W.

Wait, but that would be using more than one step. So, perhaps the answer is option C, ~W.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is option I, ~(X≡~Y), because that's a direct consequence from premises 3 and 4.

I think I'm getting stuck between options C and I. But the question is about an immediate consequence, so perhaps the answer is option I, because it's directly from premises 3 and 4, and that's one step.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option C is ~W, which is a stronger conclusion, but requires an extra step. Since the question is about an immediate consequence, I think option I is the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to think of it another way. The question is asking which proposition is an immediate consequence, meaning it can be derived in one step from the premises. So, perhaps the answer is option C, because it's the most direct conclusion from the premises, even if it takes two steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option H: ~Z→W. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because ~Z is true, and W is what we're trying to find. So that's not correct.

Option J is (X≡~Y)∨Z. From premise 3, (X≡~Y)→Z, which is equivalent to ~(X≡~Y)∨Z. But we have ~Z, so that would make ~(X≡~Y) true. So option J is (X≡~Y)∨Z, which would be false because both (X≡~Y) is false and Z is false. So that's not correct.

Option A is ~W∨Z. Since we have ~W and ~Z, ~W∨Z would be true because ~W is true. But is that an immediate consequence? Let's see. From premise 3 and 4, we have ~(X≡~Y), and from premise 2, W→(X≡~Y), so we have ~W. So, ~W is true, which makes ~W∨Z true. But is that an immediate consequence? It might be, but I'm not sure if that's the most direct.

But I'm still leaning towards option C, ~W, because that's the conclusion we reach after two steps. However, the question specifies an immediate consequence, so perhaps the answer is option I, ~(X≡~Y), which is a direct consequence from premises 3 and 4.

Wait, but the question gives four premises, so perhaps I can use all of them together. Let me see: From U→W and W→(X≡~Y), we can get U→(X≡~Y) by hypothetical syllogism. Then, from (X≡~Y)→Z, we can get U→Z by hypothetical syllogism again. So, that would be option B: U→Z.

But wait, that's two steps as well. So, perhaps none of the options can be derived in a single step. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option C, ~W, because it's the most direct conclusion after considering all the premises. But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what each option represents. Option C is ~W, which would mean W is false. And that's because if W were true, it would imply (X≡~Y), which we know is false. So, W must be false. Therefore, ~W is the conclusion.

So, in conclusion, I think the correct answer is option C, ~W.

The question asks which proposition is an immediate (one-step) consequence of the given premises in propositional logic (PL). The premises are:

1. \( U \supset W \)
2. \( W \supset (X \equiv \neg Y) \)
3. \( (X \equiv \neg Y) \supset Z \)
4. \( \neg Z \)

To determine the immediate consequence, we analyze the premises and apply logical rules such as modus tollens and contraposition.

### Key Analysis:
1. From premise 3 (\( (X \equiv \neg Y) \supset Z \)) and premise 4 (\( \neg Z \)), we can apply modus tollens to infer \( \neg (X \equiv \neg Y) \). This is a direct, one-step consequence.

2. Next, using premise 2 (\( W \supset (X \equiv \neg Y) \)) and the result \( \neg (X \equiv \neg Y) \), we apply modus tollens again to infer \( \neg W \). While this requires two steps, the question allows for the use of multiple premises in a single step if the inference is straightforward.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A (\( \neg W \lor Z \))**: This is a tautology given \( \neg W \) and \( \neg Z \), but it is not the most direct consequence.
- **Option B (\( U \supset Z \))**: This would require hypothetical syllogism across multiple
