Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about binding energy. Hmm, binding energy... right, that's the energy required to split a nucleus into its individual protons and neutrons. Or wait, no, actually, it's the energy released when the nucleus is formed from them. So it's the energy that holds the nucleus together.

The question is about Chromium-52, specifically the isotope with 24 protons because Chromium's atomic number is 24. The mass given is 51.95699 amu. Wait a second, 24Cr^52 would have a mass number of 52, so that means 24 protons and 28 neutrons because 52-24=28. Right?

I remember that the binding energy is calculated using the mass defect. The mass defect is the difference between the mass of the nucleus and the sum of the masses of its individual protons, neutrons, and electrons (wait, no, electrons are in the atom, so for the nucleus, it's just protons and neutrons). Oh wait, but when considering atomic mass, we usually account for the electrons as well. Wait, no, the atomic mass includes the nucleus plus electrons. So when calculating the mass defect, I think we compare the actual mass of the atom to the sum of the masses of the individual protons, neutrons, and electrons. But wait, because in the atom, the electrons are already part of it. So maybe I should think in terms of the atomic mass unit.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The standard approach is to calculate the mass defect as the difference between the mass of the separated nucleons (protons and neutrons) and the actual mass of the nucleus. But wait, because the given mass is the atomic mass, which includes electrons. Oh wait, but the mass of the electrons is the same on both sides, so they cancel out. Hmm, no, let me clarify.

The atomic mass includes the electrons. So if I take the mass of the atom (which includes electrons) and subtract the mass of the nucleus, which is what? No, I'm getting mixed up. Let's step back.

The formula for binding energy is based on the mass defect, which arises when nucleons come together to form a nucleus. The mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of the individual protons and neutrons because some mass is converted into energy (E=mc²). So the mass defect Δm is the sum of the masses of the individual nucleons minus the actual mass of the nucleus.

But wait, since the given mass is the atomic mass, which includes electrons, we need to be careful. The atomic mass equals the mass of the nucleus plus the mass of the electrons. So when calculating the mass defect, perhaps I should subtract the electrons' mass because the individual nucleons (protons) are considered without electrons.

Alternatively, I've heard that when using atomic masses, the binding energy can be calculated by considering the atomic mass compared to the sum of the individual protons and neutrons, each with their respective masses, including the electrons. Hmm, maybe that's complicating it.

Let me think of the standard approach. The binding energy (BE) is calculated using the formula:

BE = Δm * c²

Where Δm is the mass defect. Δm is calculated as (sum of masses of individual nucleons) - (actual mass of nucleus). But wait, the nucleus doesn't include electrons, while the individual protons would need their associated electrons to be neutral. Wait, no, because in the nucleus, protons are separate from electrons. So when considering the mass of individual nucleons, protons (without electrons) and neutrons (which have no charge) are considered. But when you have an atomic mass, it includes electrons. So perhaps the correct way is to compare the atomic mass to the sum of the masses of hydrogen atoms (for protons, since each hydrogen atom is a proton plus an electron) and neutrons.

Wait, that makes more sense. Because if I have a nucleus with Z protons and N neutrons, the atomic mass is M. The sum of the individual masses would be Z times the mass of a hydrogen atom (since each hydrogen has one proton and one electron) plus N times the mass of a neutron. So the mass defect Δm is:

Δm = [Z * m(H) + N * m(n)] - M

Then, BE = Δm * c²

Yes, that's the correct approach. Because when you combine Z protons and N neutrons into a nucleus, you also account for the electrons in the hydrogen atoms, which then form the neutral atom.

So for Chromium-52, Z=24, N=28. M is given as 51.95699 amu.

Mass of hydrogen (H) is approximately 1.007825 amu, and mass of neutron is about 1.008665 amu.

Wait, let me get the exact values. Or maybe I should remember them.

Wait, the mass of a proton is about 1.007276 amu, and the mass of a neutron is about 1.008665 amu. The mass of a hydrogen atom (proton + electron) is about 1.007825 amu, which includes the electron's mass (approximately 0.00054858 amu). But when you have Z protons, you need Z electrons to make the atom neutral, so perhaps the approach is to sum the masses of Z hydrogen atoms plus N neutrons, then subtract the actual atomic mass.

Wait, let me confirm the formula. The mass of the nucleus can be found by subtracting the mass of the electrons from the atomic mass. But for binding energy, it's more efficient to use the atomic masses and include the electrons in the calculation.

So the formula for mass defect when using atomic mass is:

Δm = [Z * m_proton + N * m_neutron] - [M_atomic - Z * m_electron]

Wait, no, perhaps not. Another approach is to take the atomic mass of the atom (which includes Z electrons) and subtract the mass of Z electrons, giving the mass of the nucleus. Then compare that to the sum of Z protons and N neutrons.

Wait, but protons have a certain mass, and neutrons too. So the sum of Z protons and N neutrons would be Z*m_p + N*m_n.

The mass of the nucleus is M_atomic - Z*m_e, where m_e is the electron mass.

So the mass defect Δm is:

Δm = Z*m_p + N*m_n - (M_atomic - Z*m_e)

Hmm, but electrons are being accounted for here. Let me see.

Wait, let me think of it as:

The actual mass of the nucleus is M_nucleus = M_atomic - Z*m_e.

The expected mass if the nucleons were separate is Z*m_p + N*m_n.

So the mass defect is Δm = Z*m_p + N*m_n - (M_nucleus) = Z*m_p + N*m_n - (M_atomic - Z*m_e).

Simplifying:

Δm = Z*(m_p - m_e) + N*m_n - M_atomic.

Wait, but m_p is the proton mass (1.007276 amu), and m_e is the electron mass (0.00054858 amu). So m_p - m_e is approximately 1.006727 amu.

But I'm getting into a lot of terms here. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the atomic mass and the masses of hydrogen and neutron.

Because each hydrogen atom has a proton and an electron, so the mass of a hydrogen atom is m_H = m_p + m_e.

So, if we have Z protons, we can think of them as Z hydrogen atoms (each with a proton and electron), and then N neutrons. The total mass would be Z*m_H + N*m_n.

But the actual atomic mass (including electrons) is M. So the mass defect would be:

Δm = [Z*m_H + N*m_n] - M

Because when the nucleus forms, the mass is M (including its electrons), and the sum of the individual parts is Z*m_H (each H has a proton and electron) plus N*m_n.

Wait, that makes sense. So the mass defect is the sum of the individual masses minus the actual atomic mass. So:

Δm = Z*m_H + N*m_n - M

Yes, that's the formula I remember. Let me confirm. So for each proton, you have a hydrogen atom (proton + electron), so Z of them. Then N neutrons. The sum is the total mass of the separated nucleons plus electrons. The actual atomic mass includes the nucleus (protons and neutrons) plus electrons. So the difference is the mass defect.

So that's the correct approach. So now, I can plug in the numbers.

Given:

Z = 24 (Cr)
N = 52 -24 =28
M =51.95699 amu
m_H =1.007825 amu
m_n =1.008665 amu

So compute:

Δm = (24 *1.007825) + (28 *1.008665) -51.95699

Let me calculate each term step by step.

First, 24 *1.007825:

24 * 1 =24.0
24 *0.007825 = 0.1878
So 24.0 +0.1878=24.1878 amu

Next, 28 *1.008665:

28 *1=28.0
28 *0.008665= let's see: 0.008665 *28 = 0.24262
So 28.0 +0.24262=28.24262 amu

Adding the two together: 24.1878 +28.24262 =52.43042 amu

Now subtract M (51.95699 amu):

Δm =52.43042 -51.95699 =0.47343 amu

Wait, that's 0.47343 amu. Now, to find the binding energy, I need to convert this mass defect into energy using E=Δm*c².

But since we're using amu, we can use the conversion factor 1 amu = 931.5 MeV (or more precisely, 931.5 MeV/u).

Wait, but wait, the units. Oh, right, 1 amu is approximately 931.5 MeV when converted via c².

So, BE = Δm *931.5 MeV

So 0.47343 amu *931.5 MeV/amu = ?

Let me compute that:

0.47343 *931.5 = ?

Let me calculate step by step.

0.4 *931.5 = 372.6
0.07 *931.5=65.205
0.00343 *931.5≈3.2 (exact: 0.003*931.5=2.7945; 0.00043*931.5≈0.399, so total ≈3.1935)

Adding up: 372.6 +65.205 =437.805 +3.1935≈440.9985 MeV

So approximately 441 MeV.

Wait, but looking at the options, the total binding energy is in the range of 4.0e8 eV to 6.6e8 eV. Let me make sure about the units.

Wait, 1 MeV is 1e6 eV. So 441 MeV is 441e6 eV, which is 4.41e8 eV.

Looking at the options, option B says 4.2e8 eV, option D 4.6e8, etc. So the calculated value is approximately 4.41e8 eV.

So that would be closest to option B (4.2e8) or perhaps option D is 4.6e8. Wait, why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error. Let me double-check the values.

Wait, let me re-calculate Δm.

Z=24, m_H=1.007825, so 24 *1.007825.

24 *1=24
24 *0.007825=0.1878
So total 24.1878 amu

N=28, m_n=1.008665, so 28 *1.008665.

Let me compute:

28 *1=28
28 *0.008665: 0.008665 * 28.

0.008665 *20=0.1733
0.008665 *8=0.06932
Sum: 0.1733 +0.06932=0.24262
So 28 *1.008665=28.24262 amu.

Sum: 24.1878 +28.24262=52.43042 amu.

M is 51.95699 amu.

Δm=52.43042 -51.95699=0.47343 amu.

Multiply by 931.5 MeV/amu: 0.47343 *931.5.

Let me compute more accurately.

0.47343 * 931.5:

Compute 0.4 *931.5= 372.6

0.07 *931.5=65.205

0.00343 *931.5= ?

0.003 *931.5=2.7945

0.00043*931.5=0.4001 (since 0.0004*931.5=0.3726, and 0.00003*931.5=0.0279 → 0.3726+0.0279=0.4005)

So 2.7945 +0.4005=3.195

So total BE= 372.6 +65.205=437.805 +3.195=440.0 MeV approximately.

Wait, so 440 MeV is 440e6 eV =4.4e8 eV.

Looking at the options:

Option B:4.2e8 eV
Option D:4.6e8 eV
Option E:5e8
Option F:5.8e8
Other options are lower or higher.

So 4.4e8 is closest to option B (4.2e8) or perhaps not any exact match. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, maybe the mass values I used are slightly off. Let me check the exact masses.

Mass of hydrogen atom (H-1) is about 1.007825032 amu.

Mass of neutron is 1.008664923 amu.

So exact calculation:

Δm = (24 *1.007825032) + (28 *1.008664923) -51.95699

Compute each term.

24 *1.007825032:

Let me compute 20 *1.007825032 =20.15650264

4 *1.007825032=4.031300128

Sum: 20.15650264 +4.031300128=24.187802768 amu.

28 *1.008664923:

Compute:

20 *1.008664923=20.17329846

8 *1.008664923=8.069318584

Sum: 20.17329846 +8.069318584=28.242617044 amu.

Total sum: 24.187802768 +28.242617044=52.43041981 amu.

M is 51.95699 amu.

Δm=52.43041981 -51.95699 =0.47342981 amu.

Multiply by 931.5 MeV/amu:

0.47342981 *931.5 ≈ ?

Let me compute 0.47342981 *931500000 eV.

Wait, 0.47342981 *931.5 = ?

Compute 0.4 *931.5=372.6 MeV
0.07 *931.5=65.205 MeV
0.00342981 *931.5 ≈3.195 MeV.

Total: 372.6 +65.205 =437.805 +3.195=440.0 MeV → 440,000,000 eV →4.4e8 eV.

So the total binding energy is approximately 4.4e8 eV. Looking at the options, the closest is B:4.2e8 or D:4.6e8. Hmm, none is exactly 4.4e8, but perhaps I made a miscalculation, or maybe the options are approximate.

Wait, perhaps I should check the question again. Oh wait, the question gives the mass as 51.95699 amu. Did I use that correctly? Yes.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the BE per nucleon calculation.

After finding the total binding energy, the next part is the binding energy per nucleon. The nucleus has 52 nucleons (24+28=52). So BE per nucleon is total BE divided by 52.

If BE is 440 MeV (4.4e8 eV), then per nucleon is 440e6 eV /52 ≈8.46e6 eV.

Wait, let me compute that:

440e6 /52 = (440/52)*1e6 = 8.4615e6 eV ≈8.46e6 eV.

Looking at the options:

Option B: 8.1e6
Option D:8.9e6
Option E:9.6e6
Option F:1.1e7
Option H:9.9e6

Hmm, 8.46e6 is closest to 8.46e6, but none of the options exactly match. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option D: 4.6 × 10^8 eV and 8.9 × 10^6 eV

Option B:4.2e8 and 8.1e6.

Hmm, if the total BE is 4.4e8, perhaps the closest option is B, but the per nucleon would need to be 8.46e6, which isn't exactly any of the options. But perhaps I miscalculated the BE.

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a slightly different value for the mass of the neutron or hydrogen.

Wait, perhaps the mass of the neutron is 1.008664 amu, and the H atom is 1.007825 amu. Let me recalculate with more precise numbers.

Wait, but I think I've used the precise values already. Another possibility is that the given mass is for the neutral atom, but perhaps the calculation expects using the nuclear mass. Wait, no, because the formula accounts for the atomic mass.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different value for the conversion factor. Like, 1 amu = 931.5 MeV, but maybe 1 amu = 931.49 MeV or something. Let me recalculate with more precision.

Δm =0.47342981 amu.

BE = 0.473429
