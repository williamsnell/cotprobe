Okay, so I've got this ethics question about a psychologist dealing with a client whose political views are repugnant. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct course of action. Let me think through this step by step.

The scenario is that Hermann H., 28, calls because he's miserable after a breakup and wants therapy. In the first session, the psychologist realizes Hermann's political views are completely against their own, and they feel they wouldn't enjoy working with him. The question is, what's the ethical thing to do here?

I remember that psychologists have ethical guidelines, like those from the APA. One key principle is respect for people's rights and dignity, which includes not discriminating based on personal characteristics. But wait, political views aren't exactly a protected class like race or gender, but still, the psychologist's personal feelings shouldn't interfere with providing competent care.

So the options are A to I. Let me go through them:

Option A: Discuss discomfort in the first session. That might be too early. The client is vulnerable and might feel judged, which could harm the therapeutic relationship.

Option B: Ignore feelings and continue. Well, if the psychologist's feelings are too strong, maybe it's better not to. But if they can manage their bias, they might proceed. However, the question says they feel they wouldn't enjoy working with him, which could affect their effectiveness.

Option C: Discuss only if relevant. That makes sense. If the political views come up as part of the therapy, then address them. Otherwise, maybe not necessary. But the psychologist's discomfort is about their own feelings, not the client's issues.

Option D: Suggest a psychologist who shares his views. Wait, that sounds like a referral based on the client's beliefs. Is that ethical? Or would it be better to refer because the psychologist can't be effective, not because they agree with the client's views.

Option E: Decline because of political views. That seems like discrimination. Ethical guidelines probably prohibit refusing treatment based on personal beliefs unless it's a legitimate conflict that affects the therapy.

Option F: See him until the crisis, then refer. That might be a way to help without long-term issues, but if the psychologist's feelings are too strong, it might not be fair to the client to have a temporary therapist.

Option G: Tell him his views are repugnant and continue. That's definitely wrong. It would harm the therapeutic alliance and is unprofessional.

Option H: Offer treatment only if he changes views. That's unethical and potentially harmful. The psychologist can't impose their beliefs as a condition for treatment.

Option I: Provide appropriate referrals. That sounds like the best option. If the psychologist feels they can't be effective due to their own feelings, they should refer the client to someone who can better help him.

Wait, but can a psychologist refuse to treat someone just because of differing political views? I think the APA Ethics Code says that psychologists should not discriminate based on certain factors, but if their personal feelings interfere with providing effective treatment, they might need to refer.

So, looking back, the correct approach is probably to refer Hermann to another psychologist. So options I or D. Option D suggests a psychologist who shares his views, which might not be necessary. The referral should be based on the psychologist's ability to help, not matching beliefs. So option I is better.

Also, the question says the psychologist feels they wouldn't enjoy working with him. If this affects their ability to provide care, it's better to refer. So the answer should be I: provide appropriate referrals.

The ethical guidelines for psychologists emphasize providing competent care without discrimination. In this scenario, the psychologist's personal discomfort with Hermann's political views could impact their effectiveness. Referring Hermann to another psychologist ensures he receives appropriate care without the therapist's bias affecting the therapy. The referral should be based on the ability to provide effective treatment, not on matching political views.

Answer: I
