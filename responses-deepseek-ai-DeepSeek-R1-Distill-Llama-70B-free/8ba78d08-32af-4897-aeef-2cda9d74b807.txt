The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A buyer purchased a new van from a car dealer. Two weeks later, the buyer was driving to work when the brakes suddenly failed. The buyer tried to stop the van for a red light, but the brakes failed to operate. As a consequence, the buyer drove through the red light and collided with a car driven by a woman. Subsequently, the woman asserted a claim against the buyer to recover for the injuries she suffered in the accident. At trial, the only evidence offered by the plaintiff concerning the cause of the accident was the testimony of an engineering expert. He testified that a manufacturing defect had caused the brakes to suddenly fail. Based on the facts stated above, a motion by the buyer to dismiss at the end of the woman's case should be

Options:

A: denied, because the buyer should have noticed the defect within two weeks of purchasing the van.
B: denied, because the buyer is strictly liable for injuries caused by a manufacturing defect in an auto that he had purchased.
C: granted, because the woman was neither the user nor the consumer of the defective product.
D: granted, because the woman presented no evidence that the buyer was negligent.
E: granted, because the buyer was not responsible for the manufacturing defect.
F: granted, because the woman failed to prove the buyer had knowledge of the defect.
G: denied, because the buyer had a non-delegable duty to maintain the brakes in a safe condition.
H: denied, because the buyer should have performed a thorough check of the van after purchase.
I: granted, because the woman did not present evidence that the accident was directly caused by the brake failure.
J: denied, because the buyer did not return the van upon noticing the brake issue.

Okay, let's try to work through this problem. So, the question is about product liability and a potential motion to dismiss. Hmm, let me break it down.

So, the situation is: A buyer bought a new van. Two weeks later, the brakes failed, causing an accident where the buyer hit another car driven by a woman. The woman is suing the buyer. At trial, the only evidence the woman presented was from an engineering expert who testified that a manufacturing defect caused the brakes to fail.

The question is whether the buyer's motion to dismiss should be granted or denied. The options are A through J.

First, I need to remember the legal principles here. It seems like a torts question, specifically about product liability. There are different theories in product liability: negligence, breach of warranty, and strict liability.

Strict liability applies to manufacturers and sometimes sellers for defective products that cause injury. But wait, the buyer here is not the manufacturer or seller; they're the consumer. So, can the buyer be held strictly liable? I don't think so. Strict liability generally applies up the chain, not to the end consumer unless they modified the product or something, which isn't indicated here.

So, if the woman is suing the buyer, what's the basis? She might be trying to claim that the buyer is somehow responsible. But the buyer isn't the manufacturer, so maybe she's trying to argue negligence. Let's think about negligence: the buyer would have to have a duty, breach it, cause in fact, proximate cause, and damages.

In this case, the buyer bought the van, drove it, and the brakes failed. The expert says it's a manufacturing defect. The buyer didn't do anything wrong in maintaining the brakes, as far as we know. So, if the buyer had no knowledge of the defect and didn't contribute to it, then maybe there's no negligence.

Wait, but the buyer is the owner. Could there be a claim under negligence per se? Or perhaps under some theory of product liability as a seller? But again, the buyer isn't the seller; they're the consumer.

Another angle: sometimes, under product liability, if a product is found defective and causes injury, the manufacturer is liable. But the buyer isn't the manufacturer. So the woman's claim would normally be against the manufacturer or the dealer, not the buyer. Unless there's some other theory.

So, the woman is suing the buyer. What's the basis? If she's claiming the buyer was negligent, she needs to show the buyer did something wrong. But the facts don't indicate any negligence by the buyer. The expert testified about a manufacturing defect, not about the buyer's actions.

Therefore, the woman didn't present any evidence that the buyer was negligent. She only showed that the product was defective. So, if the plaintiff (woman) relies solely on the manufacturing defect without showing the buyer's fault, her case might fail against the buyer.

Looking at the options:

Option B says the motion should be denied because the buyer is strictly liable. But I thought strict liability doesn't apply to the buyer as a consumer. So B is probably wrong.

Option D says the motion should be granted because the woman presented no evidence of the buyer's negligence. That sounds right because if she's suing in negligence, she needs to show the buyer was negligent, which she didn't.

Option E says the motion should be granted because the buyer wasn't responsible for the manufacturing defect. That's also a possible reason. But the question is about the evidence presented. The woman didn't show any negligence by the buyer, so the motion to dismiss would be granted.

So the options are between D and E. Let me think again. The motion is made at the end of the plaintiff's case, so it's a directed verdict type motion, which tests whether there's enough evidence to support the claim. If the plaintiff didn't present sufficient evidence on an essential element, the motion would be granted.

The essential elements for negligence are duty, breach, causation, etc. If the plaintiff didn't show breach (i.e., the buyer did something wrong), then the claim fails. The expert only testified about the manufacturing defect, not about any action or inaction by the buyer. So the plaintiff didn't meet the burden on breach of duty, so the motion should be granted.

So option D seems correct.

Wait, but what about Option E? It says the buyer wasn't responsible for the defect. That's a substantive defense, but in terms of motion to dismiss, it's about the sufficiency of evidence. So if the plaintiff didn't show any evidence of the buyer's negligence, the motion is granted because the case lacks evidence on that point. So D is the correct reason.

Therefore, the answer should be D.
</think>

The question revolves around whether the buyer's motion to dismiss should be granted or denied in a case where the woman sued the buyer for injuries caused by a manufacturing defect in the van's brakes. The key issue is the sufficiency of the evidence presented by the woman to establish the buyer's liability.

The woman's case relied solely on the testimony of an engineering expert, who testified that a manufacturing defect caused the brakes to fail. However, the buyer, as the consumer, is not typically held strictly liable for manufacturing defects under product liability laws. Strict liability generally applies to manufacturers or sellers, not end consumers, unless the consumer modified the product or contributed to the defect, neither of which is indicated here.

For the woman to succeed in a negligence claim against the buyer, she would need to show that the buyer breached a duty of care, which requires evidence of the buyer's fault or negligence. However, the woman presented no evidence that the buyer was negligent, knew about the defect, or failed to maintain the brakes properly. The expert's testimony only addressed the existence of a manufacturing defect, not the buyer's actions or omissions.

Given the lack of evidence showing the buyer's negligence, the woman failed to meet the essential elements of a negligence claim. Therefore, the buyer's motion to dismiss should be granted because the plaintiff did not present sufficient evidence to support her case.

Option D correctly identifies that the motion should be granted due to the absence of evidence regarding the buyer's negligence, making it the most appropriate choice.

Answer: D
