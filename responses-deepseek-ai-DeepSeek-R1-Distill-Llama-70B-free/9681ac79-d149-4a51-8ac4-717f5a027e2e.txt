Okay, so I've got this question about the alpha decay of Polonium-210, and I need to find the available energy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear physics, but let's think this through.

First, I remember that alpha decay involves the nucleus emitting an alpha particle, which is a helium nucleus (two protons and two neutrons). So, when Po-210 undergoes alpha decay, it transforms into another element. I think the general reaction is something like Po-210 → Pb-206 + He-4. Let me check that—Polonium has an atomic number of 84, right? So subtracting 2 protons gives 82, which is lead. And the mass number goes from 210 to 206, since the alpha has mass 4. So yeah, the decay produces lead-206 and helium-4.

Now, the available energy for the decay is the Q-value, which is the total energy released. This comes from the mass difference between the parent nucleus and the products. The formula is Q = (mass of Po-210 - mass of Pb-206 - mass of He-4) * c². Since we're dealing with atomic masses, I should probably use atomic mass units (u) and then convert to MeV.

Wait, but I don't remember the exact masses. Maybe I can recall some approximate values. The atomic mass of Po-210 is around 209.9829 u. Lead-206 is about 205.9744 u. And helium-4 is 4.0026 u. Let me plug these into the equation.

So, mass difference = 209.9829 - 205.9744 - 4.0026. Let me calculate that. 209.9829 minus 205.9744 is 4.0085. Then subtract 4.0026, which gives 0.0059 u. Hmm, that's a very small number. But wait, I must have made a mistake here because the available energy for alpha decay is usually a few MeV, not a tiny fraction.

Oh wait, I think I messed up the mass of Po-210. Let me double-check. I think Po-210's atomic mass is actually higher. Maybe I got the exact value wrong. Let me think again. I recall that the mass of Po-210 is approximately 210 u, but wait, that's probably the nominal mass. The actual mass is slightly less because of binding energy. Wait, no, the actual atomic mass includes the binding energy as mass defect. So perhaps Po-210 is around 209.9829 u, as I initially thought.

Wait, wait, maybe the exact numbers are different. Alternatively, perhaps the mass of Po-210 is 210 exactly? No, atomic masses are usually slightly less than the sum of protons and neutrons due to binding energy, but in this case, Po-210 has a mass of approximately 209.9829 u. So let's proceed with that.

So the mass difference is 0.0059 u. Now, to convert that to energy, I need to multiply by c². I remember that 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So the energy is 0.0059 u * 931.5 MeV/u. Let me calculate that: 0.0059 * 931.5 ≈ 5.5 MeV. Hmm, that's around 5.5 MeV. But looking at the options, there’s an option E:6.10, option A:5.80, option I:5.40. Wait, I'm getting around 5.5, which isn't exactly an option. Did I make a mistake?

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise masses. Let me think. Another approach is to use the Q-value formula for alpha decay, which is Q = [M(Po) - M(Pb) - M(He)] * c².

Wait, perhaps I can look up the actual masses. Po-210's atomic mass is 209.982874 u. Pb-206 is 205.974449 u. He-4 is 4.002603 u.

So the mass difference is 209.982874 - 205.974449 - 4.002603 = 

Let me compute 209.982874 - 205.974449 first. That's 4.008425 u. Then subtract 4.002603, which gives 0.005822 u.

Multiply by 931.5 MeV/u: 0.005822 * 931.5 ≈ let's see. 0.005 *931.5 is about 4.6575, and 0.000822 *931.5 is approximately 0.766. So total around 5.4235 MeV.

Hmm, that's approximately 5.42 MeV. Looking at the options, option I is 5.40 MeV, and option H is 5.00. So 5.42 is closer to 5.40, which is option I. But wait, I remember that the actual Q-value for Po-210's alpha decay is around 5.4 MeV. But some sources might round it differently.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because another way to calculate this is using the alpha decay energy formula, which might involve the binding energy or other factors. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the decay energy in terms of the work done by the Coulomb force and the strong nuclear force—though that's more complicated.

Another thought: maybe I should use the semi-empirical binding energy formula to find the binding energies of Po-210, Pb-206, and He-4, then find the difference. But that seems more involved and time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can recall the typical alpha decay energies. I think Po-210's alpha decay has a Q-value of about 5.4 MeV, which would correspond to option I.

Wait, but another possibility: I might have mixed up the masses. Let me double-check the mass of Po-210. Oh wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the mass values earlier. Let me try to get the correct masses.

Looking up the atomic masses:
- Po-210: 209.982874 u
- Pb-206: 205.974449 u
- He-4: 4.002603 u

So the calculation is correct: 0.005822 u. Multiply by 931.5 gives approximately 5.42 MeV.

So the available energy is about 5.42 MeV. Looking at the options, the closest is option I:5.40 MeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the value is given as 5.4 MeV exactly. So the correct answer would be option I.

To determine the available energy for the alpha decay of Po-210, we calculate the Q-value, which represents the total energy released during the decay. The reaction is:

\[
\text{Po-210} \rightarrow \text{Pb-206} + \text{He-4}.
\]

The Q-value is given by:

\[
Q = \left( M_{\text{Po-210}} - M_{\text{Pb-206}} - M_{\text{He-4}} \right) \cdot c^2,
\]

where \( M \) represents the atomic masses of the isotopes. Using the following atomic masses:

- \( M_{\text{Po-210}} = 209.982874 \, \text{u} \),
- \( M_{\text{Pb-206}} = 205.974449 \, \text{u} \),
- \( M_{\text{He-4}} = 4.002603 \, \text{u} \),

the mass difference is:

\[
\Delta M = 209.982874 - 205.974449 - 4.002603 = 0.005822 \, \text{u}.
\]

Converting this mass difference to energy using \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \):

\[
Q = 0.005822 \cdot 931.5 \approx 5.42 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

This value is closest to option I, which is \( 5.40 \, \text{MeV} \). Therefore, the available energy for the alpha decay of Po-210 is approximately \( 5.40 \, \text{MeV} \).
