Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Buckley Amendment, and I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think through this.

First, I remember that there are several laws related to education and student rights. One of them is FERPA, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. I think FERPA deals with student records and privacy. So maybe that's related to the Buckley Amendment.

Wait, the Buckley Amendment—oh right, I think that's another name for FERPA. So the question is asking what the Buckley Amendment establishes. The options are about various rights and requirements.

Looking at the options:

Option A talks about hospitals modifying procedures for patients with disabilities. That doesn't ring a bell with FERPA. FERPA is more about education records, I believe.

Option B is about parents inspecting a child's medical records. Hmm, maybe, but I thought FERPA was more about school records, not medical. Medical records might be covered under HIPAA, but that's a different law.

Option C says schools must provide a "free appropriate public education" (FAPE). I'm pretty sure FAPE comes from the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), not FERPA. So probably not C.

Option D: Parents can inspect their child's school records. That sounds familiar. FERPA does give parents (and eligible students) the right to inspect and review their education records. So D could be the answer.

Option E requires schools to provide specialized instruction. Again, that seems more like IDEA's requirement, ensuring special education services.

Option F is about employers providing reasonable accommodations. That's the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), specifically Title I.

Option G and H are about accessing one's own hospital or mental health records. Those might be under HIPAA, which deals with health information privacy.

Option I is about modifying tests for job applicants with disabilities. That's also ADA-related, I think.

So putting it all together. The Buckley Amendment (FERPA) establishes the right of parents or legal guardians to inspect their child's school records. That would be option D.

The Buckley Amendment, also known as the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), establishes the right of parents or legal guardians of a child to inspect the child’s school records. This law focuses on protecting the privacy of student education records and providing access to those records for parents and eligible students. Among the options provided, the correct answer aligns with FERPA's provisions regarding the inspection of school records.

Answer: D
