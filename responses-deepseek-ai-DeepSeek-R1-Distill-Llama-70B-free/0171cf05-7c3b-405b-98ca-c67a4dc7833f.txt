Question:

A farmer has a large field where he grows corn. He hires a crop-duster to spray the field, but the crop- duster mistakenly sprays a strong herbicide, rather than a pesticide, and kills all the corn plants in the field. Several days later, a construction company building a house near the farmer's field negligently hits a gas line and starts a fire that burns everything in the area, including the farmer's field. If the farmer brings negligence claims against the crop-duster and the construction company in order to recover damages for the destruction of his corn crop, the most likely result is

Options:

A: neither the crop-duster nor the construction company is liable, because neither is a "but for" cause of the harm.
B: both the crop-duster and the construction company are liable, because each engaged in a negligent action that was sufficient to destroy the farmer's corn crop.
C: only the crop-duster is liable, because its negligence occurred before the construction company's negligence.
D: both the crop-duster and the construction company are liable, because they both contributed to the loss of the farmer's corn crop.
E: neither the crop-duster nor the construction company is liable, because the farmer did not have insurance for his corn crop.
F: neither the crop-duster nor the construction company is liable, because the farmer failed to protect his field.
G: only the construction company is liable, because the fire caused more damage than the herbicide.
H: only the crop-duster is liable, because the construction company's fire was an unforeseeable event.
I: only the construction company is liable, because its negligence would have destroyed the farmer's corn crop no matter what the crop- duster did.
J: the crop-duster is liable for the value of the corn crop and the construction company is liable for the damage to the field.

Okay, so I've got this legal question about negligence and liability. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

Alright, the situation is a farmer whose cornfield was destroyed. First, a crop-duster mistakenly sprays herbicide instead of pesticide, killing all the corn. Then, a few days later, a construction company negligently causes a fire that burns the field. The farmer is suing both for negligence. The question is about who is liable.

Hmm. I remember that in negligence cases, you have to prove duty, breach, causation, and damages. Causation can sometimes be tricky, especially when there are multiple events. I think about the concepts of "but for" causation and proximate cause.

So, the crop-duster's action directly killed the corn plants. Without the herbicide, the corn would still be alive. Then the construction company's fire burned the field. But wait, the corn was already dead from the herbicide. Does that mean the fire didn't cause any additional harm regarding the corn?

Wait, but the farmer is suing for the destruction of the corn crop. The corn was already dead, so the fire didn't kill it again, but maybe it destroyed the remains or the field. Or perhaps the question is only about the corn's destruction, not the field's damage. 

I'm a bit confused about whether the fire caused damage beyond what the herbicide did. If the corn was dead, perhaps the fire just burned the dead plants. But the farmer's claim is about the corn being destroyed. So maybe the herbicide was the actual cause of the corn's death, and the fire was just an additional event that didn't contribute to that specific harm.

But wait, another angle: sometimes when two negligent acts contribute to the harm, even if one seems sufficient, both can be liable. Like if two people's negligence each cause the same harm, they're both responsible. But in this case, the first act (herbicide) killed the corn, and the second (fire) might have just burned the dead plants. So perhaps the fire didn't cause the corn's death but just destroyed the already dead plants. Or maybe it's about the timing. But the farmer is suing for the destruction of the corn, which was already done by the herbicide.

Alternatively, could the fire have caused any additional damage? Let's think. Maybe the fire damaged the soil or the field in a way that affects future crops, but the question is specifically about the corn that was already killed by the herbicide. So perhaps the fire didn't cause any additional loss regarding the corn's destruction.

So, causation-wise, the crop-duster's negligence was the cause in fact (but for their action, the corn wouldn't have died). The construction company's fire was a subsequent event. Now, under the principles of proximate cause, was the fire a foreseeable result? Or was it an intervening cause that breaks the chain of liability?

If the fire was a superseding cause, then the crop-duster might not be liable for the fire's damages. But in this case, the fire didn't cause the corn to die again; it just burned the already dead plants. So maybe the crop-duster is liable for the corn's death, and the construction company isn't, because their action didn't contribute to the corn's destruction but just dealt with the aftermath.

Wait, but the question is about the destruction of the corn crop. The crop-duster killed the corn, and the fire just destroyed the dead plants. So the farmer's loss is the value of the corn crop, which was already lost due to the herbicide. The fire might have destroyed the field, but perhaps the question is only about the corn. So in that case, the construction company's action didn't cause the corn's destruction; it just burned the remains.

So, looking at the options, option H says only the crop-duster is liable because the fire was an unforeseeable event. Alternatively, option J suggests the crop-duster is liable for the corn and the construction company for the field. But I'm not sure if the question includes damage to the field beyond the corn.

Wait, the question states the farmer is bringing claims for the destruction of his corn crop. So the issue is about the corn, not the field. So the fire didn't cause the corn to be destroyed; it was already destroyed. Therefore, the construction company isn't liable for the corn's destruction because their action didn't cause it. The crop-duster is liable because their action did.

So looking at the options:

Option H: only crop-duster liable, fire unforeseeable.

Option J: crop-duster liable for corn, construction for field.

But the question is only about the corn, so perhaps the fire didn't affect the corn's destruction. Therefore, only the crop-duster is liable.

Wait, but another thought: in some cases, multiple tortfeasors can be liable if their actions contribute to the harm. But here, the harm (corn death) was already complete before the fire. So the fire didn't contribute to that harm. Therefore, only the crop-duster is liable.

So the correct answer would be H? Or maybe J, if the field damage is considered.

Wait, the question says the fire "burns everything in the area, including the farmer's field." So the field itself was damaged. But the farmer is suing for the destruction of the corn crop. So the corn was already dead; the fire just burned the dead plants and maybe the field's soil.

If the farmer is suing for the corn's value, then only the crop-duster is liable. But if the field's damage is part of the claim, then maybe the construction company is also liable for that. But the question says "in order to recover damages for the destruction of his corn crop," which suggests the focus is on the corn, not the field.

So the crop-duster is liable for the corn's death. The fire didn't cause the corn's death, so the construction company isn't liable for that part.

Looking at the options, option H says only the crop-duster is liable because the fire was unforeseeable. Alternatively, option I says only the construction company is liable because their negligence would have destroyed the corn regardless. But that doesn't make sense because the herbicide already killed the corn before the fire.

Wait, no. The construction company's fire wouldn't have destroyed the corn if the herbicide hadn't already killed it. Or would it? Let me think. Suppose the corn was alive, the fire would have destroyed it. But in this case, the corn was already dead. So the fire didn't destroy the corn; it was dead already. So the construction company can't be held liable for the corn's destruction because it was already dead.

So in that case, only the crop-duster is liable. So the correct answer is H.

Wait, but another angle: sometimes, even if the harm has already occurred, a subsequent event might be considered if it's a foreseeable result. But the fire was caused by negligence, so maybe it's a superseding cause. Let me think. The crop-duster's initial negligence was killing the corn. Then the construction company's negligence caused a fire which destroyed the field, including the dead corn. But the corn was already dead, so the fire didn't contribute to the corn's destruction.

Alternatively, if the fire had started before the herbicide took effect, then maybe both could have contributed. But here, the herbicide acted first.

So I think only the crop-duster is liable for the corn's destruction. The fire didn't cause the corn to die, so the construction company isn't liable for that part.

Looking at the options again, option H is "only the crop-duster is liable, because the construction company's fire was an unforeseeable event." Wait, but was the fire unforeseeable? The construction company was negligent in hitting the gas line, causing a fire. Is that a foreseeable event? Maybe. If the crop-duster could have foreseen that a fire might occur after spraying herbicide, but I think that's less likely. Alternatively, the fire was an intervening cause that the crop-duster couldn't have foreseen. So perhaps H is correct.

Wait, but another thought. The construction company's act was negligent, but was it a superseding cause? The key is whether the initial tortfeasor (crop-duster) could have foreseen the subsequent event. If not, then the chain of causation is broken, and the initial tortfeasor isn't liable for the subsequent damage. But in this case, the initial damage (killing the corn) is done, and the subsequent event (fire) is just another damage to the field, perhaps, but not the corn's destruction.

So the farmer's claim is about the corn's destruction, which was caused solely by the crop-duster. The fire didn't contribute to that, so the construction company isn't liable for the corn.

Therefore, the correct answer is H.

The question involves a farmer suing two defendants—a crop-duster and a construction company—for the destruction of his corn crop. The crop-duster mistakenly sprayed herbicide, killing the corn, and the construction company later negligently caused a fire that burned the field. The farmer seeks damages for the destruction of his corn crop.

To determine liability, the analysis focuses on causation. The crop-duster's negligence directly caused the corn's death, as the herbicide killed the plants before the fire occurred. The construction company's fire, while negligent, did not contribute to the corn's destruction because the corn was already dead. The fire may have damaged the field or the dead plants, but the farmer's claim specifically pertains to the destruction of the corn crop.

Under negligence law, the crop-duster is liable because their action was the "but for" cause of the corn's death. The construction company's fire, occurring after the corn was already destroyed, did not cause the harm for which the farmer is seeking damages. Therefore, the construction company is not liable for the corn's destruction. The fire could be considered an unforeseeable intervening event, breaking the chain of causation for the construction company's liability regarding the corn.

Among the options, the correct answer is:

H: Only the crop-duster is liable, because the construction company's fire was an unforeseeable event.

H
