Okay, I'm trying to figure out the best answer for this question. Let me read it carefully.

So, there's a school psychologist helping Ms. Smith with problem behaviors in her class. The data shows that 26 out of 30 students have had discipline referrals. That's a lot—over 85%. So, the issue seems widespread in the class, not just a few students.

The options are various interventions. I need to pick the best recommendation.

Option A: Individual counseling for the 4 without referrals. Hmm, that seems odd. Those 4 are behaving well, so why counsel them? It doesn't address the problem with the majority.

Option B: In-school suspension for 26. That's a lot of students. In-school suspension might not be effective for such a large number and might not address the root cause. Plus, managing that many in suspension seems impractical.

Option C: Detention for 26. Similar issue as B. Detention is a punishment but doesn't teach better behavior. Also, 26 is a big number to handle with detention.

Option D: Class-wide behavior management plan, like a response-cost raffle. Oh, response-cost systems are positive behavioral interventions. Since most students are having issues, a class-wide approach might be efficient. It can target everyone, reinforcing good behavior and reducing disruptions. That sounds promising.

Option E: Alternative school for 26. That seems extreme and probably not feasible. Also, it's separating students rather than addressing the problem in their current environment.

Option F: School-wide assembly. While it's good to address behavior, a one-time assembly might not have a lasting impact, especially if the problem is concentrated in one class. It’s too broad and not targeted.

Option G: Peer mediation. This could help with interpersonal issues but might not address the overall behavioral problems affecting learning. Plus, if most students are misbehaving, peers might not be reliable mediators.

Option H: Group counseling on study skills, etc. Group counseling could help some students, but again, with 26 students, it's a lot. Also, it doesn't directly address the classroom behavior as a whole.

Option I: Comprehensive assessments for those with referrals. Assessing each student could help identify individual issues, but with 26 students, that's time-consuming and might not provide a quick solution to the classroom disruption.

Option J: Individual behavior contracts for 26. Creating contracts for each might be effective, but managing 26 individual plans could be overwhelming for the teacher. It's more work than a class-wide approach.

Putting it all together, the problem is class-wide, so a class-wide intervention makes the most sense. Option D suggests a response-cost raffle, which is a type of positive reinforcement. It encourages good behavior and can be applied consistently across the class. That seems like the best approach because it's proactive, addresses the majority, and is manageable.

The question involves a school psychologist addressing widespread behavioral issues in a class where 26 out of 30 students have received discipline referrals. The goal is to identify the most effective intervention. 

- **Option A** suggests individual counseling for the 4 students without referrals, which is unnecessary since they are behaving well and does not address the majority of the class.  
- **Option B** and **Option C** propose punishments like in-school suspension or detention, which are reactive and do not teach better behavior. Managing 26 students in such settings is also impractical.  
- **Option D** recommends a class-wide behavior management plan, such as a response-cost raffle. This is a proactive, positive intervention that can reinforce good behavior across the entire class, making it efficient and targeted.  
- **Option E** involves sending 26 students to an alternative school, which is extreme and unrealistic.  
- **Option F** suggests a school-wide assembly, which is too broad and unlikely to have a lasting impact on the specific class.  
- **Option G** proposes peer mediation, which may not address the overall behavioral issues, especially with most students misbehaving.  
- **Option H** involves group counseling, which could help some students but does not directly address classroom behavior.  
- **Option I** suggests comprehensive assessments for 26 students, which is time-consuming and not immediately actionable.  
- **Option J** involves individual behavior contracts for 26 students, which is manageable but less efficient than a class-wide approach.  

Given the widespread nature of the problem, a class-wide intervention like a response-cost raffle (Option D) is the most effective and practical solution, as it proactively addresses the entire class and reinforces positive behavior.

Answer: D
