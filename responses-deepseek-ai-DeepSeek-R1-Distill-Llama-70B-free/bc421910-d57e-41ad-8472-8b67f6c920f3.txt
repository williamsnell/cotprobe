Okay, so I have this question about the movie Psycho, specifically the shower scene. I remember that scene is super iconic, but I'm not exactly sure about the details. The question is asking what substance was used for blood in that scene. The options are A through J, with various red liquids and substances listed.

Hmm, I think the director was Alfred Hitchcock. He was known for being meticulous, so I guess he would choose something that looked realistic on black and white film. Wait, Psycho was in black and white, right? So the blood wouldn't have looked red to the audience, but they still needed something that would appear as blood on screen.

I remember hearing somewhere that they used chocolate syrup. Why? Because it's thick and would flow in a way that looked like blood when filmed. Plus, it might photograph better in black and white. But wait, let me think again. Was it chocolate syrup or something else?

Another option is tomato juice. I think some people might confuse it with that, but I'm more inclined towards chocolate syrup. Oh, and I've also heard about them using something like Hershey's syrup. That would make sense because it's viscous and dark, which would show up well on film without being too bright red.

Wait, what about the other options? Red food coloring would be too thin, maybe. Cranberry juice is another possibility, but I think the consistency might not be right. Beetroot juice is also an option, but I'm not sure if that was used. I think the answer is E, chocolate syrup.

Wait, but another thought: I've heard that in some cases, they used a mixture. But I'm pretty sure the main substance was chocolate syrup. So I'll go with E.

The shower scene in 'Psycho' used chocolate syrup to simulate blood because it was thick and photographed well in black and white.
