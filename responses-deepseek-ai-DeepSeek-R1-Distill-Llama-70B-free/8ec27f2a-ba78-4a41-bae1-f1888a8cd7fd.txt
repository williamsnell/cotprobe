Okay, so I have this problem about entropy and probabilities of messages. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my information theory, but let me try to think this through. 

The question says there are six messages with probabilities 1/4, 1/4, 1/8, 1/8, 1/8, and 1/8. I need to find the entropy. Wait, right—entropy in this context is a measure of the average uncertainty or information content per message.

I remember the formula for entropy H is the sum over all possible outcomes of each outcome's probability multiplied by the logarithm (base 2) of the inverse of the probability. So H = -Σ p_i * log2(p_i), where p_i is each probability.

Let me list out the probabilities to make it clearer. There are two messages with p=1/4 and four messages with p=1/8. That makes sense—2*(1/4) +4*(1/8) = 2/4 +4/8 = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1, which is correct because all probabilities must sum to 1.

So I can split the sum into two parts: the two 1/4 probabilities and the four 1/8 ones.

Calculating each part:

For the first two messages (p=1/4 each):
Each term is (1/4) * log2(4/1) because log2(1/p) is log2(4) when p=1/4. Log2(4) is 2 because 2^2=4. So each term is (1/4)*2. Since there are two such terms, 2 * (1/4 * 2) = 2*(0.5) = 1.

Wait wait, no. Wait, the entropy H is the sum of each p_i multiplied by log2(1/p_i). So for each 1/4 message, it's (1/4)*log2(4) = (1/4)*2 = 0.5. There are two of them, so 2 * 0.5 = 1.

Now for the four messages with p=1/8 each. Each term is (1/8) * log2(8). Log2(8) is 3 because 2^3=8. So each term is (1/8)*3 = 3/8 = 0.375. Since there are four of these, 4 * 0.375 = 1.5.

Wait, no, wait: 4 * (1/8 *3) = 4*(3/8) = 12/8 = 1.5.

So adding the two parts together: H = 1 (from the two 1/4 messages) + 1.5 (from the four 1/8) = 2.5 bits per message.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Another way to compute it: 

Each 1/4 message contributes 0.5, so two of them make 1. Each 1/8 contributes (1/8)*3 = 0.375, and four of those give 1.5. So 1 +1.5 = 2.5. 

Looking at the options, option I is 2.50 bits/message. So the answer should be I. 

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistake. Let me recalculate:

For p=1/4: each is 1/4 * log2(4) = (1/4)*2 = 0.5. Two of them: 0.5*2=1.

For p=1/8: each is 1/8 *3 = 0.375. Four of them: 0.375 *4=1.5.

Total H=1+1.5=2.5. Yep, that's correct. So the answer is I.

To determine the entropy of the communication system with six messages having probabilities \( \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{8}, \) and \( \frac{1}{8} \), we use the formula for entropy:

\[
H = -\sum p_i \log_2(p_i),
\]

where \( p_i \) is the probability of each message. The probabilities are divided into two groups: two messages with \( p = \frac{1}{4} \) and four messages with \( p = \frac{1}{8} \).

### Step 1: Calculate the contribution from the two messages with \( p = \frac{1}{4} \)
For each message with \( p = \frac{1}{4} \):
\[
\text{Contribution} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \log_2(4) = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 2 = 0.5.
\]
Since there are two such messages:
\[
\text{Total contribution} = 2 \cdot 0.5 = 1.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the contribution from the four messages with \( p = \frac{1}{8} \)
For each message with \( p = \frac{1}{8} \):
\[
\text{Contribution} = \frac{1}{8} \cdot \log_2(8) = \frac{1}{8} \cdot 3 = 0.375.
\]
Since there are four such messages:
\[
\text{Total contribution} = 4 \cdot 0.375 = 1.5.
\]

### Step 3: Add the contributions
The total entropy is the sum of the contributions:
\[
H = 1 + 1.5 = 2.5 \, \text{bits/message}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The entropy of the communication system is **2.50 bits/message**, which corresponds to option **I**.
