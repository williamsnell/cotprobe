Okay, so I've got this question here about family systems and feedback. Hmm, I remember in my psychology class we touched on this topic. Let me think. The question is asking about the type of feedback that helps minimize deviation and maintain stability in a family.

Wait, feedback in systems theory, right? So, I think feedback in families is a way they communicate to either change or maintain behavior. There's positive and negative feedback, I believe. Positive feedback amplifies a behavior, making it more likely to continue. Like when someone does something and gets praised, they do it more. But negative feedback is about reducing a behavior. So when the family notices someone deviating, they might give negative feedback to bring things back to normal.

But the question says the feedback helps minimize deviation and maintain stability. That sounds like negative feedback because it's about correcting or adjusting behavior to stay within certain limits. Positive feedback would probably increase variation, not minimize it.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes the terms can be tricky. Let me think again. In biological systems, negative feedback lowers a response, bringing things back to a set point. Like when your body temperature rises, you sweat to cool down. So applying that to families, negative feedback would help the family stay stable by countering changes.

So the answer should be negative feedback. Looking at the options, option B is negative. So the correct answer is B.

The question asks about the type of feedback that helps minimize deviation and maintain stability within a family. In systems theory, feedback can be categorized into positive and negative. Positive feedback amplifies behavior, while negative feedback reduces deviation and restores equilibrium. Since the question specifies feedback that maintains stability, the correct answer is negative feedback.

Answer: B
