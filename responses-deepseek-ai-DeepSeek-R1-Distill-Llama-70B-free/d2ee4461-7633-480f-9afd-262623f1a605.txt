Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the reflectance of a quarter-wave antireflection film. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question says that the film is made of magnesium fluoride, which has a refractive index of 1.35. And it's coated on an optical glass with an index of 1.52. I remember that antireflection coatings work by reducing the reflection of light at the surface. They usually do this by causing the reflected light waves to cancel each other out through destructive interference.

Wait, so how does that work exactly? Oh right, when light hits a boundary between two media, some of it reflects off the top surface, and some goes through and reflects off the bottom. If the thickness of the film is a quarter of the wavelength of the light (in that medium), then the two reflected waves will be out of phase by half a wavelength, leading to destructive interference. That reduces the total reflection.

But wait, the formula for reflectance... I think it involves the refractive indices of the three layers: air (or incident medium), the film, and the substrate. The formula might be something like (n2^2 - n1*n3)/(n2^2 + n1*n3) all squared or something. Or was it (n1 - n2)/(n1 + n2) squared? I'm getting a bit confused.

Oh wait, maybe I should think in terms of the reflectance at each interface. The first reflection is from air to the MgF2 film. Then the second reflection is from MgF2 to glass. Since the film is quarter-wave thick, these two reflections should interfere destructively.

So the formula for the total reflectance (R) when you have a quarter-wave film is R = [(n2^2 - n1*n3)/(n2^2 + n1*n3)]^2. Wait, or was it [ (n2 - sqrt(n1 n3)) / (n2 + sqrt(n1 n3)) ] squared? Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe I should recall the general approach.

Another approach: The reflectance from the first surface (air to MgF2) is R1 = [(n2 - n1)/(n2 + n1)]^2. Since air has n1=1, and MgF2 is n2=1.35. Then R1 is (0.35/2.35)^2. Let me calculate that: 0.35 squared is 0.1225, divided by (2.35)^2 which is about 5.5225. So 0.1225 / 5.5225 is approximately 0.0222, which is 2.22%. So without any coating, the reflectance would be about 4.4% since there are two surfaces (front and back). But wait, the problem is about a single surface with a coating.

Wait no, wait. The optical glass has a higher refractive index than MgF2. So the setup is air (n=1) → MgF2 (n=1.35) → glass (n=1.52). The MgF2 is a quarter-wave thick in the wavelength of the light in that medium.

So the idea is that the reflection from the air-MgF2 interface and the MgF2-glass interface will destructively interfere. But I think the formula for this is R = [(n2^2 - n1 * n3) / (n2^2 + n1 * n3)]^2.

Wait, I think that's the correct formula. Because when the film has a refractive index that's the geometric mean of the two media, the reflection cancels out. But here, it's not exactly the geometric mean, since sqrt(1 * 1.52) is about 1.23, and MgF2 is 1.35, which is higher. So the reflection won't be zero.

So substituting the numbers: n1 is 1 (air), n2 is 1.35 (MgF2), n3 is 1.52 (glass). So the numerator is (1.35)^2 - (1)(1.52) = 1.8225 - 1.52 = 0.3025.

The denominator is (1.35)^2 + (1)(1.52) = 1.8225 + 1.52 = 3.3425.

So the fraction is 0.3025 / 3.3425 ≈ 0.0905. Squared, that's (0.0905)^2 ≈ 0.00819, which is 0.819%.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 0.8% as an option. Wait, option A is 0.8%, option B is 0.2%, option C is 0.5%, etc. So 0.8% is option A. But wait, my calculation gives about 0.819%, which is close to 0.8%, so that would be option A.

But wait, let me double-check the formula I used. Another possible formula for reflectance with a quarter-wave film is R = [ (n2 - n1) * (n3 - n2) ] / [ (n2 + n1) * (n3 + n2) ] ] squared. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. I think the correct formula is indeed R = [ (n2^2 - n1 n3) / (n2^2 + n1 n3) ]^2.

Alternatively, maybe each reflection contributes, but I think the formula I used is correct. Let me compute again.

n2 squared is 1.35^2 = 1.8225.

n1 * n3 is 1 * 1.52 = 1.52.

So numerator is 1.8225 - 1.52 = 0.3025.

Denominator is 1.8225 + 1.52 = 3.3425.

0.3025 / 3.3425 = approximately 0.0905.

Square that: (0.0905)^2 = 0.00819, which is 0.819%.

So that would round to about 0.8%, which is option A.

Wait, but I thought sometimes the formula is presented differently. Let me think of another approach.

Another way: The amplitude reflection coefficients for the two interfaces are r1 and r2.

r1 is the reflection at the air-film interface: (n2 - n1)/(n2 + n1) = (1.35 -1)/(1.35+1) = 0.35/2.35 ≈ 0.1489.

r2 is the reflection at the film-glass interface: (n3 - n2)/(n3 + n2) = (1.52-1.35)/(1.52+1.35) = 0.17 / 2.87 ≈ 0.05926.

Because the film is quarter-wave thick, the phase change upon reflection for the second reflection is such that the two reflected waves interfere destructively. Wait, but I think that when the film is a quarter-wave thick, the path difference is half a wavelength, causing a phase shift of 180 degrees. But wait, when light reflects off a medium with higher refractive index, it undergoes a phase shift of 180 degrees. So let's think: first reflection (air to MgF2) - since MgF2 has higher n than air, there is a phase shift of π. The second reflection (MgF2 to glass) - glass has higher n than MgF2, so that reflection also has a phase shift of π. But wait, when the light goes through the film, reflects off the glass, and comes back, it travels twice the film thickness. Since it's a quarter-wave film, the optical path is 2*(λ/4) = λ/2. So the wave from the second reflection is delayed by λ/2, which is another phase shift of π.

So the first reflection has a phase shift of π, and the second reflection has a phase shift of π plus another π (because of the path difference), so total phase difference of 2π. So the two reflected waves would be in phase?

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think again. The light from the first reflection (r1) has a phase shift of π. The light that goes through the film, reflects off the glass (r2), and then comes back up. The path length is 2d, and since d is λ/(4n2), the optical path is 2*(λ/(4n2)))*n2 = λ/2. So that's a phase shift of (2π/λ)*(λ/2) )= π. Plus any phase shift from the reflection. So the second reflection (r2) has a phase shift of π (from reflection) plus π from the path length, so total 2π, which brings it back to the same phase as the original.

Wait, but the first reflection (r1) had a phase shift of π. The second reflection (r2) would have a phase shift of 2π. So the relative phase between them is 2π - π = π. So they are out of phase by π, meaning destructive interference.

So the total reflected amplitude is r1 + r2 * e^{iπ} = r1 - r2.

So the amplitude is (r1 - r2). Then the reflected intensity is proportional to (r1 - r2)^2.

So let's compute r1 and r2.

r1 = (1.35 - 1)/(1.35 +1) = 0.35/2.35 ≈ 0.1489.

r2 = (1.52 - 1.35)/(1.52 + 1.35) = 0.17/2.87 ≈ 0.05926.

So r1 - r2 = 0.1489 - 0.05926 ≈ 0.08964.

So the reflected intensity R is (0.08964)^2 ≈ 0.00804, which is 0.804%, approximately 0.8%. So that's option A.

Wait, but earlier when I used the formula [(n2^2 -n1 n3)/(n2^2 +n1 n3)]^2, I got the same result. So that's consistent. So the correct answer should be 0.8%, which is option A.

Wait, but looking back at the options: option A is 0.8%, which matches our calculation.

To calculate the reflectance of a quarter-wave antireflection film, we use the formula:

\[
R = \left( \frac{n_2^2 - n_1 n_3}{n_2^2 + n_1 n_3} \right)^2
\]

Here:
- \( n_1 = 1 \) (air),
- \( n_2 = 1.35 \) (magnesium fluoride),
- \( n_3 = 1.52 \) (optical glass).

### Step 1: Compute the numerator and denominator
\[
n_2^2 = 1.35^2 = 1.8225, \quad n_1 n_3 = 1 \cdot 1.52 = 1.52
\]
\[
\text{Numerator: } n_2^2 - n_1 n_3 = 1.8225 - 1.52 = 0.3025
\]
\[
\text{Denominator: } n_2^2 + n_1 n_3 = 1.8225 + 1.52 = 3.3425
\]

### Step 2: Compute the fraction
\[
\frac{\text{Numerator}}{\text{Denominator}} = \frac{0.3025}{3.3425} \approx 0.0905
\]

### Step 3: Square the result to find reflectance
\[
R = (0.0905)^2 \approx 0.00819 \approx 0.819\%
\]

### Step 4: Match with the closest option
The calculated reflectance of approximately \( 0.8\% \) matches option **A**.
