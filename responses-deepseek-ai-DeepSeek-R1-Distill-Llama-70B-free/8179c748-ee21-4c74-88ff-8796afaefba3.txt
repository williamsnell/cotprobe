Okay, so I need to figure out how much a queen and a king are worth together in blackjack. Hmm, I remember that in blackjack, each card has a specific value. Let me think about the rules.

I recall that in blackjack, numbered cards are worth their face value. So a 2 is 2, a 3 is 3, and so on up to 10. Then there are the face cards—jack, queen, king—and the ace. I think the face cards are all worth 10 points each. Oh right, and the ace can be 1 or 11, but that's probably not relevant here since the question is about queen and king.

So if the queen is 10 and the king is also 10, then together they should add up to 20. Wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing this up with another game. Yeah, in blackjack, face cards are definitely 10 each. So adding them together would be 10 + 10 = 20.

Looking at the options, option G is 20. So the answer should be G.

In blackjack, both the queen and king are worth 10 points each. Adding them together gives a total of 20. 

Answer: G
