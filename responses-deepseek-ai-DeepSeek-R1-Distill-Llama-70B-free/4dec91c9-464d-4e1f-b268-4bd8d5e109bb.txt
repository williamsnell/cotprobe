Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it says. A student has 3 puzzles, and each puzzle has 1,250 pieces. The question is asking for the total number of pieces in all the puzzles combined. Hmm, that sounds straightforward, but I want to make sure I get it right.

Alright, so each puzzle has 1,250 pieces. And there are 3 puzzles. So I think I need to multiply the number of puzzles by the number of pieces each has. That makes sense because if you have multiple groups of the same size, multiplying gives the total.

So let me write that down. 3 puzzles multiplied by 1,250 pieces each. Let's do the math. 3 times 1,250. Wait, what's 1,250 times 3? Let me break it down. 1,000 times 3 is 3,000, and 250 times 3 is 750. So adding those together, 3,000 plus 750 equals 3,750. So the total number of pieces should be 3,750.

Now I need to check the options to see which one matches. The options are from A to J. Let's go through them. Option A is 3,250, which is less than what I got. B is 5,000, which is way higher. C is 3,750, which matches my calculation. D is 4,000, higher than needed. E is 4,250, also higher. F is 2,500, too low. G is 3,650, a bit less than my answer. H is 4,750, higher. I is 4,650, higher. J is 3,500, which is also less than 3,750.

So the correct answer should be option C, 3,750. Wait, let me double-check my multiplication to be sure. 1,250 times 3. 1,250 plus 1,250 is 2,500, and adding another 1,250 gives 3,750. Yep, that's correct. So I'm confident that C is the right choice.

The student has 3 puzzles, each with 1,250 pieces. To find the total number of pieces, multiply the number of puzzles by the number of pieces per puzzle: 3 Ã— 1,250 = 3,750. Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is C: 3,750.
