Okay, so I've got this biology question here about a potato in water. Hmm, I remember that this has something to do with osmosis, which is the movement of water across a semipermeable membrane. Let me think about what happens when you put a potato slice into pure water.

Potatoes are made up of cells, right? And each cell has a cell membrane that's semipermeable. So the potato cells are like little bags of solute surrounded by water. Pure water has no solutes, so when the potato is immersed in it, the concentration of solutes inside the potato cells is higher than the surrounding water.

Wait, concentration gradient is key here. Since the potato cells have a higher concentration of solutes, water from the surrounding (which is pure) will move into the potato cells through osmosis. Oh right, because water moves from an area of lower solute concentration to higher. So the potato will absorb water.

But wait, the question is about what happens after the potato is immersed. So initially, water moves into the potato cells. If the potato is in pure water, the cells will swell. But if they're plant cells, they have a cell wall. So they can't burst because the cell wall stops them from expanding too much. Instead, they'll just become turgid.

Looking at the options now. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Water moves from surrounding water into potato. That sounds correct because the potato cells are taking in water.

Option B: Solutes move into the potato. No, because pure water has no solutes. Unless the potato is releasing solutes, which is possible but not the main point here. The main movement is water.

Option C: No movement. That can't be right because osmosis would occur.

Option D: Potato cells plasmolyze. Plasmolysis is when cells lose water and shrink. That happens when the surrounding solution is more concentrated. But here, it's pure water, so the opposite. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Solutes move into water. Well, the potato cells are in pure water, so any solute movement would be from the potato into the water, right? But the question is about what happens after immersion. So both water and solute movement can occur, but the question is specifically about which option describes the activity.

Option F: Water and solutes move equally. I don't think so because the cell membrane is selective. Water moves more freely than larger solute particles.

Option G: Potato dissolves. No, that doesn't happen. It just absorbs water.

Option H: Water moves from potato into water. That's the opposite of what happens. Unless the potato is in a hypertonic solution, but here it's pure water, so H is wrong.

Option I: Potato absorbs all the water. No, because the water will move until equilibrium is reached. It won't absorb all the water, just until the concentration gradient is balanced as much as possible.

Option J: Cells burst. That's for animal cells without a cell wall. Potato cells have a cell wall, so they don't burst. They just become turgid.

So back to the options. The activity after immersion is water moving into the potato. So the correct answer would be A. Wait, but waitâ€”another thought. The potato is made of dead cells because it's a vegetable, or are the cells still alive? Wait, no, when you cut a potato, the cells on the surface might be damaged, but the inner cells are still alive. So the cell membranes are still intact and semi-permeable.

So the correct process is osmosis, water moving into the cells. So the activity is water moving into the potato.

Looking at the options again, option A says water moves into the potato. Option E is about solutes moving out. Option H is water moving out. So the correct answer should be A.

Wait, but another possibility: when you put a potato slice into water, it might initially absorb water, but after a while, does anything else happen? Like, if the potato stays there long enough, maybe some solute exchange happens. But the question is about the activity after immersion, so the immediate or initial activity.

So the main movement is water into the potato. Therefore, option A is correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem says "a piece of potato is dropped into a beaker of pure water." So the surrounding solution is pure water, and the potato's cells have solutes. So water will move into the potato cells. So the correct answer is A.

Alternatively, option E is about solutes moving into the water. So if the potato is in pure water, any solutes from the potato would diffuse out into the water. But does that happen? Because the cell membrane is semipermeable, so small solute molecules can pass. But in this case, the primary activity is osmosis, the movement of water.

So the question is which describes the activity. So water movement is the main thing. So A is correct.

But wait, another thought. The potato is a living tissue, so the cells are living. So when you put them in pure water, they will absorb water, become turgid. But in a beaker, the potato might not have enough water to fully swell. But the process is water moving in.

So among the options, A is correct.

When a piece of potato is immersed in pure water, the cells of the potato interact with the surrounding water through the process of osmosis. Osmosis is the movement of water across a semipermeable membrane, such as the cell membrane, from an area of lower solute concentration to an area of higher solute concentration. Since the potato cells contain solutes (e.g., sugars, salts, and other compounds) and the surrounding water is pure, water moves from the surrounding water into the potato cells.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Water moves from the surrounding water into the potato. This is correct because water enters the potato cells due to the concentration gradient.
- **B**: Solutes in the water move into the potato. This is incorrect because the water is pure and contains no solutes.
- **C**: No movement of water or solutes occurs. This is incorrect because osmosis ensures water movement into the potato cells.
- **D**: Potato cells plasmolyze. This is incorrect because plasmolysis occurs when water leaves the cells, which happens in a hypertonic solution, not pure water.
- **E**: Solutes in the potato move into the water. While some solute movement may occur over time, the primary and immediate activity is water moving into the potato cells.
- **F**: Water and solutes move equally in both directions. This is incorrect because the movement of water and solutes is not equal, as the cell membrane is selective.
- **G**: The potato dissolves in the water. This is incorrect because the potato does not dissolve; it simply absorbs water.
- **H**: Water moves from the potato into the surrounding water. This is incorrect because water moves into the potato, not out of it.
- **I**: The potato absorbs all of the water. This is incorrect because water movement stops when equilibrium is reached, not when all water is absorbed.
- **J**: The potato cells burst due to water intake. This is incorrect because plant cells have a cell wall that prevents bursting.

The correct answer is **A**, as water moves from the surrounding water into the potato cells through osmosis.
