Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Stern's theory from 1956 in the context of the nature-nurture controversy. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

First, I remember that the nature-nurture debate is about whether human behavior is influenced more by genetics (nature) or the environment (nurture). So Stern's theory must be on one side or perhaps a middle ground.

Wait, Stern... I think he was a psychologist. Wasn't he related to the concept of the "genetic blueprint"? Or maybe not. Let me try to recall. I remember there's someone who proposed that the environment pulls traits out from a genetic potential. Oh right, Stern's rubber-band hypothesis. 

So the idea is that each trait has a range of possible expression, like a rubber band that can stretch but not beyond certain limits. The environment determines where within that range the trait will fall. So the genotype sets the boundaries, and the environment pulls it to a specific point within those limits.

Looking at the options, option I is the "Rubber-band" hypothesis. That must be Stern's theory. Let me check the other options to make sure I'm not confusing it with someone else.

Option A is "Genetic blueprint," which I think is more like Galton's idea, where genetics determines everything, and the environment just triggers it. Option J is "Genetic endowment," which sounds similar. But Stern's approach was more about the interaction between genes and environment, not just genes determining.

Option E is the "Blank slate," which is the nurture extremeâ€”John Locke's idea that we're born without any innate traits. That's not Stern. Option B, "Innate potential," sounds like it could be related, but I think that's more like Chomsky's innate abilities for language.

So yeah, the correct answer should be I: "Rubber-band" hypothesis. That's Stern's contribution, emphasizing the interaction where genetics set the range and environment pulls the outcome within that range.

The theory of Stern (1956) in the nature-nurture controversy is best described as the "Rubber-band" hypothesis. This theory suggests that genetic factors set the boundaries for trait development, while environmental influences determine where within those boundaries the traits will manifest. It emphasizes the interaction between genetic potential and environmental factors, rather than advocating for one side of the debate exclusively.

The correct answer is:

I: "Rubber-band" hypothesis

I
