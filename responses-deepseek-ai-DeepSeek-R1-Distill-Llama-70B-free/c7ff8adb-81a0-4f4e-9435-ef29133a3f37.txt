Question:

Digital images are often represented by the red, green, and blue values (an RGB triplet) of each individual pixel in the image. A photographer is manipulating a digital image and overwriting the original image. Which of the following describes a lossless transformation of the digital image?

Options:

A: Compressing the image in a way that may lose information but will suffer only a small loss of image quality.
B: Converting the image to black and white by assigning the maximum value of the RGB triplet to each pixel.
C: Resizing the image by reducing the number of pixels, which may lose some detail.
D: Enhancing the image by adjusting the contrast, brightness and saturation, which may alter the original pixel values.
E: Creating the gray scale of an image by averaging the amounts of red, green, and blue in each pixel and assigning this new value to the corresponding pixel in the new image. The new value of each pixel represents a shade of gray, ranging from white to black.
F: Adding a watermark on the image by overlaying a semi-transparent image on top of the original image.
G: Applying a filter to the image that changes the color balance, resulting in a different color representation.
H: Creating a sepia toned version of the image by applying a certain formula to the RGB values of each pixel.
I: Creating the negative of an image by creating a new RGB triplet for each pixel in which each value is calculated by subtracting the original value from 255. The negative of an image is reversed from the original; light areas appear dark, and colors are reversed.
J: Modifying part of the image by taking the pixels in one part of the picture and copying them to the pixels in another part of the picture.

Okay, so I've got this question about digital images and lossless transformations. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to work it out.

The question is asking which of the options describes a lossless transformation. I remember that lossless means the image doesn't lose any data, so the original can be restored perfectly. Lossy compression, like in JPEGs, reduces the file size by discarding some data, which affects quality.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Compressing the image possibly losing info but small quality loss. That sounds like lossy compression, so not lossless. So A is out.

Option B: Convert to black and white by assigning max RGB value. Wait, so each pixel's R, G, B values are set to the max of the triplet. That changes the data. For example, a pixel with (100,200,150) becomes (200,200,200). So the original data is lost, and you can't get back the exact original image. So B is a lossy transformation. Not what we're looking for.

Option C: Resizing by reducing pixels. Resizing definitely reduces the number of pixels, so detail is lost. That's a lossy change. So C is out.

Option D: Enhancing by adjusting contrast, brightness, saturation. These adjustments alter the pixel values. Once you change them, you can't go back unless you saved the original. So this is lossy. D is not the right choice.

Option E: Creating grayscale by averaging RGB and assigning the new value. Grayscale conversion where each pixel's RGB is replaced by the average. So the original RGB values are discarded, replaced by a single value. You can't recover the original colors, so this is lossy. E is out.

Option F: Adding a watermark by overlaying a semi-transparent image. Adding a watermark would change the pixel data where the watermark is. So the original image is altered, making it impossible to get back the exact original. So F is lossy. Not the answer.

Option G: Applying a filter changing color balance. Filters like sepia or others change the RGB values. Once applied, the original data is altered, so it's lossy. G is out.

Option H: Sepia tone by applying a formula to RGB. Similar to G, this changes each pixel's values. So lossy again. H is not it.

Option I: Creating a negative by subtracting each value from 255. Oh, wait, if you subtract each RGB component from 255, you're inverting them. So each pixel's new triplet is (255-R, 255-G, 255-B). Since this is a reversible process—because you can subtract each from 255 again to get back the original—this is a lossless transformation. So I is a candidate.

Option J: Copying pixels from one part to another. Like a clone or copy-paste within the image. This changes the pixels in the target area. So the original data in those areas is lost, making it a lossy change. So J is out.

Wait, but let me double-check. Lossless means no data is lost, so the original can be restored. So in option I, if every pixel is inverted, but the data is stored precisely, then yes. It's just a transformation, not a compression. So you can reverse it, so it's lossless.

So the correct answer should be I.

To determine which option describes a lossless transformation of a digital image, we analyze each choice:

- **A**: This involves compression that may lose information, making it a lossy transformation.  
- **B**: Converting to black and white by assigning the maximum RGB value discards the original RGB data, resulting in a lossy transformation.  
- **C**: Resizing the image reduces the number of pixels, which loses detail and is therefore lossy.  
- **D**: Adjusting contrast, brightness, and saturation alters the original pixel values, making it lossy.  
- **E**: Creating grayscale by averaging RGB values replaces the original RGB data, resulting in a lossy transformation.  
- **F**: Adding a watermark changes pixel data, making it impossible to recover the original image, so it is lossy.  
- **G**: Applying a filter to change color balance alters the original RGB values, making it lossy.  
- **H**: Sepia toning involves applying a formula to RGB values, which changes the original data and is lossy.  
- **I**: Creating a negative by subtracting each RGB value from 255 is a reversible process, as the original values can be restored by applying the same operation again. This is a lossless transformation.  
- **J**: Copying pixels from one part of the image to another alters the original data in the target area, making it lossy.  

The only option that describes a lossless transformation is **I**, as it preserves the ability to restore the original image data.
