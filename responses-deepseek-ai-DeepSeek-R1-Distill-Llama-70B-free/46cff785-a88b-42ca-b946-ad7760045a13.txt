Okay, so I've got this question here about who said that "Natural law is based on the nature of man and on his inward need of living in society." The options are from A to J, with different philosophers. Hmm, I need to figure out who it is.

First, I remember that natural law theory is a big topic in philosophy, especially among certain thinkers. Let's think about each option.

Option A is Spinoza. I know he was more into rationalism and pantheism, not sure if he's the one for natural law in this context.

Option B is Rousseau. He talked a lot about society and the social contract, but I think his focus was more on general will and how society shapes us, not exactly natural law as described.

Option C is Aristotle. He believed in natural law, but I'm trying to remember. He thought about ethics and the natural order, but the quote seems more specific about human nature and society. Maybe, but not certain.

Option D is Kant. He was more into moral law derived from reason, like the categorical imperative. I don't think this quote is his style.

Option E is Socrates. He focused on ethics and self-examination, not so much natural law theory.

Option F is Hobbes. He talked about the state of nature and the social contract. He believed natural law was about self-preservation and the need for society to avoid the war of all against all. That sounds close to the quote.

Option G is Hugo Grotius. He's a key figure in natural law, especially in international law. He wrote about the law of nations and the idea that natural law is based on human nature and society. That seems to fit the quote exactly.

Option H is Plato. He discussed justice and the ideal state, but more in terms of forms and the philosopher-king, not natural law as described.

Option I is Descartes. He was a rationalist, more into mind-body dualism and not so much natural law theory.

Option J is Locke. He talked about natural rights (life, liberty, property) and the social contract, but I think his focus was more on rights than the inward need for society as the basis of natural law.

So, putting it together, the quote emphasizes natural law based on human nature and the need to live in society. Grotius is known for his work in natural law, especially in the context of human society. Hobbes also talked about the necessity of society, but Grotius seems more directly associated with the principles of natural law as described.

Wait, but let me double-check. The quote says natural law is based on the nature of man and his inward need for society. Grotius did write about natural law being derived from human nature and the need for social life. Yes, that fits. So the answer should be G: Hugo Grotius.

The quote "Natural law is based on the nature of man and on his inward need of living in society" is most closely associated with Hugo Grotius, a key figure in the development of natural law theory. Grotius emphasized that natural law derives from human nature and the inherent necessity for social interaction. While other philosophers like Hobbes and Locke discussed related concepts, Grotius's work directly aligns with the principles expressed in the quote.

Answer: G
