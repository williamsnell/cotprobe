Okay, so I've got this question about matrices and eigenvalues. Let me try to unpack what's being asked here. The question is about finding for which 2x2 matrices A there exists a nonzero matrix M such that AM = MD, where D is the diagonal matrix [[2,0],[0,3]]. And I need to give the answer in terms of the eigenvalues of A.

Hmm. I remember that when dealing with matrix equations like AM = MD, it's often related to similarity transformations or eigenvalues. Oh wait, right! If M is invertible, then AM = MD would imply that A and D are similar matrices because you could write M⁻¹AM = D. But the question just says M is nonzero, so it doesn't necessarily have to be invertible. Hmm, that's a bit tricky.

So D is a diagonal matrix with entries 2 and 3. That means D has eigenvalues 2 and 3. If A is similar to D, then A would have the same eigenvalues as D, right? So maybe A's eigenvalues must be 2 and 3?

Wait, but the question doesn't specify that M is invertible. So maybe A doesn't have to be similar to D. What if M isn't invertible? Then AM = MD could still hold without A and D being similar. But I'm a bit confused about how that would work.

I think another angle is to consider the equation AM = MD. Let's write this out in terms of matrix multiplication. Let M be a 2x2 matrix with columns m1 and m2. Then AM = [A m1 | A m2], and MD = [D m1 | D m2]. So for each column, we have A m_i = D m_i for i = 1,2. Wait, but D is diagonal, so D m_i would be scaling each component of m_i by 2 and 3, respectively.

So for each column m_i of M, A m_i must equal D m_i. But D isn't a scalar; it's a matrix. So perhaps each column of M is an eigenvector of A corresponding to eigenvalues 2 and 3? Because D's action on m_i is scaling by 2 for the first component and 3 for the second. 

Wait, but if m_i is a vector, then D acting on m_i would produce a vector where each component is scaled by the corresponding diagonal entry of D. So maybe each column of M is in the eigenspace of A for eigenvalues 2 and 3. But for that to happen, A must have eigenvalues 2 and 3, because otherwise, there wouldn't be such eigenvectors.

Wait, but M is a 2x2 matrix, so it has two columns. So each column would correspond to an eigenvector of A for eigenvalue 2 and 3. But if A has two distinct eigenvalues, then it's diagonalizable, right? So if A is diagonalizable with eigenvalues 2 and 3, then such a matrix M exists because M would be the matrix of eigenvectors, and then AM would be A acting on each eigenvector, which scales them by 2 and 3, matching MD since D is diag(2,3).

But what if A doesn't have distinct eigenvalues? Suppose A has a repeated eigenvalue. Then maybe M can't have two linearly independent columns, so M would have to be singular. But the question only requires M to be nonzero, so maybe that's possible. But wait, the equation AM = MD would require that each column of M is an eigenvector of A for the corresponding eigenvalue in D. If D has eigenvalues 2 and 3, then each column of M must lie in the respective eigenspaces of A for 2 and 3.

So for M to have two columns that are eigenvectors of A corresponding to 2 and 3, A must have eigenvalues 2 and 3. Because then the eigenvectors exist. So the possible eigenvalues of A are 2 and 3.

Looking at the options, I need to find the option where the eigenvalues are 2 and 3. Let me check each option:

Option A: [1,2] → eigenvalues 1 and 2 → no
Option B: [3,4] → 3 and 4 → no
Option C: [2,4] → 2 and 4 → no
Option D: [2,3] → yes, 2 and 3 → this looks right
Option E: [1,3] → 1 and 3 → no
Option F: [6,7] → no
Option G: [0,1] → no
Option H: [4,5] → no
Option I: [5,6] → no
Option J: [3,5] → no

So the correct answer should be option D, where the eigenvalues are 2 and 3.

To determine for which 2×2 matrices \( A \) there exists a nonzero matrix \( M \) such that \( AM = MD \), where \( D = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 3 \end{bmatrix} \), we analyze the relationship between \( A \) and \( D \). The equation \( AM = MD \) implies that \( A \) and \( D \) share eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues of \( D \), which are 2 and 3. For such eigenvectors to exist, \( A \) must have eigenvalues 2 and 3.

If \( A \) has eigenvalues 2 and 3, it is diagonalizable, and the columns of \( M \) can be chosen as the eigenvectors of \( A \) corresponding to these eigenvalues. This ensures that \( AM = MD \) holds. Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( A \) must be 2 and 3.

Among the given options, only **Option D: [2, 3]** satisfies this condition. All other options list eigenvalues that do not match the required eigenvalues of 2 and 3.

Answer: D
