C: 0.21 cm
D: 2.1 cm
E: 210 cm
F: 2100 cm

Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about finding the wavelength of emitted photons from hydrogen atoms. Hmm, I remember that wavelength and frequency are related somehow. Oh right, the speed of light equation! I think it's c equals lambda times nu, right? So c = λν. 

Wait, but wait. What's c in this context? Oh yeah, the speed of light in a vacuum. I remember that's approximately 3.00 x 10^8 meters per second. But wait, the question wants the wavelength in centimeters. Oh right, so I need to convert units properly.

The frequency given is 1.42 x 10^9 Hz. So the formula is λ = c / ν. Got it. Let's plug in the numbers. 

So c is 3.00e8 m/s, ν is 1.42e9 Hz. Let me compute that. So 3e8 divided by 1.42e9. Let me do the division step by step.

First, 3e8 divided by 1.42e9. Hmm, 3 divided by 1.42 is approximately 2.113... Wait, wait, let me think about the exponents. 1e8 divided by 1e9 is 0.1. So 3e8 / 1.42e9 is the same as (3/1.42) * (1e8/1e9) = (2.113) * 0.1 = 0.2113... 

Wait, but wait, I think I should double-check that calculation. So 3 divided by 1.42 is approximately 2.113, yes. Then multiply by 0.1 because of the exponent division. So 0.2113 meters. 

But the question asks for centimeters. Oh right, because 1 meter is 100 centimeters. So I need to convert meters to centimeters. So 0.2113 meters is 21.13 centimeters. Wait, no. Wait, 1 meter is 100 cm, so 0.2113 m is 21.13 cm. Hmm, that doesn't seem right because the options don't have 21 cm as the first thought. Let me check.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me redo the calculation. Maybe I messed up somewhere. So λ = c / ν. c is 3e8 m/s, ν is 1.42e9 Hz. So, 3e8 / 1.42e9 equals (3 / 1.42) * (1e8 / 1e9) = (approx 2.113) * (0.1) = 0.2113 meters. Converting meters to centimeters, multiply by 100, so 0.2113 m = 21.13 cm. Oh, okay, so that's about 21 cm.

Looking at the options, option G is 21 cm. So the answer should be G. But wait, I remember that the 21 cm line is a famous emission line from hydrogen atoms. Yeah, that's right! So this must be correct. So the correct answer is G.

To determine the wavelength of the emitted photons, we use the relationship between the speed of light \( c \), wavelength \( \lambda \), and frequency \( \nu \):  

\[
c = \lambda \nu \quad \text{or} \quad \lambda = \frac{c}{\nu}
\]

Here, the speed of light \( c \) is approximately \( 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and the given frequency \( \nu \) is \( 1.42 \times 10^9 \, \text{Hz} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\lambda = \frac{3.00 \times 10^8}{1.42 \times 10^9}
\]

First, divide the coefficients:  

\[
\frac{3.00}{1.42} \approx 2.113
\]

Next, adjust the powers of 10:  

\[
\frac{10^8}{10^9} = 10^{-1}
\]

Thus:  

\[
\lambda \approx 2.113 \times 10^{-1} = 0.2113 \, \text{meters}
\]

To convert meters to centimeters (since \( 1 \, \text{m} = 100 \, \text{cm} \)):  

\[
0.2113 \, \text{m} = 21.13 \, \text{cm}
\]

This value is approximately \( 21 \, \text{cm} \), which corresponds to option **G**. Additionally, the 21 cm line is a well-known emission line from hydrogen atoms, confirming the correctness of this result.

**Answer: G**
