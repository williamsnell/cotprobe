Okay, so I have this physics problem about a car going up an incline, and I need to figure out the horizontal and vertical accelerations. Hmm, let's think step by step.

Alright, the car is moving with speed v and reaches the foot of an incline. Then it coasts up without using the engine. So, the engine isn't providing any additional force; it's just under the influence of gravity and maybe other forces.

Wait, the problem says to neglect friction and air resistance. So the only forces acting on the car are gravity and the normal force from the incline. Right, because with no engine, the only other forces are these two.

So when the car is on the incline, its motion is influenced by these forces. Let me visualize this. The incline is at an angle θ. Gravity acts downward, so it can be split into components parallel and perpendicular to the incline.

The gravitational force has two components: one along the incline (mg sinθ) and one perpendicular (mg cosθ). Since there's no friction, the only forces are these components and the normal force.

Wait, but the car is moving up the incline. Since there's no engine, it's decelerating as it goes up because gravity is doing negative work. So the acceleration must be opposite to the direction of motion, which is up the incline.

But wait, the problem is about the horizontal (ax) and vertical (ay) accelerations. Oh wait, I think I might be confusing the coordinate system here. Let's clarify: in problems like this, sometimes we use a coordinate system aligned with the incline (x along the incline, y perpendicular), but the question here is about horizontal and vertical, which is a different system.

Ah, right. So the horizontal direction is perpendicular to the vertical, not aligned with the incline. So the car's acceleration has to be broken down into horizontal (ax) and vertical (ay) components, not along the slope.

Wait, but when the car is on the incline, the only acceleration is due to gravity. Because the car is in free motion under gravity, right? So what's the acceleration here?

Wait, no. Wait, when an object is moving on a slope without friction, the acceleration is along the slope, caused by the component of gravity. Because the normal force is perpendicular and doesn't contribute to acceleration in that direction.

So in the incline's coordinate system, the acceleration a is mg sinθ along the slope downward, because the car is slowing down as it goes up. But the question is about the horizontal and vertical components of this acceleration.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The car is moving up the incline, but decelerating. So its acceleration is directed down the incline. So in the incline's x-direction (along the slope), the acceleration is negative, say ax' = -g sinθ (if up is positive). The y' direction (perpendicular) has no acceleration because the normal force balances the perpendicular component of gravity.

But the question asks about the horizontal (ax) and vertical (ay) accelerations in the standard coordinate system, not aligned with the slope.

So I need to find the components of the acceleration vector in the horizontal and vertical directions of the Earth's frame.

Hmm, the acceleration along the slope is a = g sinθ downward. So to find the horizontal and vertical components of this acceleration, I need to break it down.

The slope makes an angle θ with the horizontal. So the acceleration along the slope is at an angle θ relative to the vertical. Wait, no. Let me think: the direction of the acceleration is along the slope, which is at angle θ above the horizontal. So the acceleration vector is pointing down the slope, making angle θ with the vertical.

Wait, no. If the incline is at angle θ from the horizontal, then the acceleration along the slope (downward) is at angle θ below the horizontal. Because the slope is θ above horizontal, so the acceleration is directed down along the slope, which would make it θ below the horizontal in the Earth's frame.

Wait, maybe it's easier to draw a diagram. Let's say the incline goes up to the right. The car is moving up but slowing. The acceleration is down the slope, which is to the left and down. So the acceleration vector is in the direction opposite to the car's motion.

To find the horizontal (ax) and vertical (ay) components of this acceleration, we can decompose it.

Since the acceleration is along the slope (which is inclined at θ), its horizontal and vertical components would be a_x = a * cosθ and a_y = a * sinθ, but considering the direction. Wait, because the acceleration is directed down the slope, its horizontal component is opposite to the car's direction of motion. So, if the slope goes to the right, the acceleration's horizontal component is to the left, and the vertical component is downward.

Wait, perhaps more accurately: the acceleration vector is a = g sinθ along the slope downward. So the magnitude is a = g sinθ, and its direction is along the slope downward.

So, in the Earth's frame, the horizontal component would be a_x = a * sinθ? Or wait, maybe it's a_x = a * cosθ. Let me think.

Wait, when you have a vector along a slope (angle θ from the horizontal), the components can be found using the angle. For a vector of magnitude a at angle θ below the horizontal (since it's pointing down the slope), the horizontal component is a * cosθ, and the vertical component is a * sinθ downward.

Wait, no. Let me clarify with an example. If the acceleration is along the slope (θ above the horizontal), then the direction of the acceleration is θ above the horizontal, but since it's pointing downward, it's θ below the horizontal in the Earth's frame.

Wait, maybe it's better to model it with a coordinate system where the x-axis is horizontal and the y-axis is vertical. The slope is at angle θ to the x-axis. The acceleration is along the negative slope direction, so it's in the direction of -x' where x' is along the slope.

So the acceleration vector has a magnitude of a = g sinθ (wait, is that correct?), and makes an angle θ with the negative x-axis.

Wait, actually, wait a second. Let me think about the forces again. The car is moving up the incline, but without any engine force, so the only force along the incline is the component of gravity. The component of gravity along the slope is m g sinθ, acting down the slope. So the acceleration along the slope is a = (m g sinθ)/m = g sinθ, directed down the slope.

So the acceleration in the slope's x' direction is -g sinθ (negative because it's down the slope). Now, to find the components in the Earth's x (horizontal) and y (vertical) directions.

The slope makes an angle θ with the horizontal. So the acceleration vector is along the slope (x' direction), which is at angle θ above the horizontal. So, the acceleration vector is -g sinθ in the x' direction.

To find the components:

ax (Earth's horizontal) = a_x' * cosθ - a_y' * sinθ. Wait, no, that's for rotation. Alternatively, I can resolve the vector into Earth's components.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to represent the acceleration in vector components. The acceleration vector is pointing along -x' (down the slope), which is at angle θ relative to the Earth's x-axis.

So, the Earth's x-component (ax) would be (-g sinθ) * cosθ. Because the x' direction is at angle θ from Earth's x. So, the ax component is a_x' * cosθ. Similarly, the Earth's y-component (ay) would be (-g sinθ) * sinθ, but wait, that would be for the direction.

Wait, no. Let me think again: when you have a vector in the x' direction (which is along the slope), to get its components in Earth's frame, you can use rotation matrices. The x' axis is at angle θ from Earth's x-axis, so the transformation for a vector (a_x', a_y') in the slope's frame to Earth's frame (x,y) is:

ax = a_x' cosθ + a_y' sinθ
ay = a_x' sinθ - a_y' cosθ

But in this case, the acceleration in the slope's frame is a_x' = -g sinθ, and a_y' = 0 because there's no acceleration perpendicular to the slope (since the normal force balances mg cosθ and there's no movement in that direction).

So plugging into the transformation:

ax = (-g sinθ) * cosθ + 0 * sinθ = -g sinθ cosθ
ay = (-g sinθ) * sinθ - 0 * cosθ = -g (sinθ)^2

Wait, that gives the acceleration components. But let's think about the signs. The car is moving up the slope, which is in the positive x' direction, but the acceleration is negative x', so the ax component is negative (opposite to the direction of motion in Earth's x direction), and ay is also negative (since it's pointing downward in Earth's frame).

But the problem is about the magnitudes, so we can ignore the signs.

So |ax| = g sinθ cosθ
|ay| = g (sinθ)^2

Wait, but sinθ cosθ is (1/2) sin 2θ, which is maximized when θ is 45 degrees, giving sinθ cosθ = 0.5. So the maximum value of |ax| would be (g) * 0.5 when θ is 45 degrees. But for θ less than 45, sinθ cosθ is less than 0.5, so |ax| would be less than g/2. For θ greater than 45, sinθ is still less than 1, but the product depends. Wait, no, for θ >45, cosθ decreases, so sinθ cosθ would still be less than 0.5. Wait, no, wait: for θ=90 degrees, sinθ is 1, cosθ is 0, so product is 0. So |ax| is zero. For θ=0 degrees, the incline is flat, so |ax| is zero. The maximum is indeed at 45 degrees, which is 0.5 g.

So |ax| is always less than g.

What about |ay|? It's g (sinθ)^2. Since sinθ can be up to 1, (sinθ)^2 is up to 1, so |ay| can go up to g. For example, when θ is 90 degrees (vertical), |ay| would be g. Wait, but in that case, the incline is vertical, so the car is moving straight up, and the acceleration is -g. So in that scenario, |ay|=g, and |ax|=0.

But when θ is less than 90, |ay| is less than g. Because (sinθ)^2 is less than 1. For example, θ=30 degrees: (sin30)^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25, so |ay|=0.25 g.

So in this problem, both |ax| and |ay| are less than g, but wait, that's not correct because when θ approaches 90, |ay| approaches g.

Wait, but the question is about the car moving up an incline, so θ is between 0 and 90 degrees. So for θ=90, the car is moving straight up, and |ay|=g, |ax|=0.

So depending on θ, |ax| can be less than g, and |ay| can be less than or equal to g.

But the problem says to find the magnitude of ax and ay.

So in all cases except when θ=90, |ay| < g. When θ=90, |ay|=g, |ax|=0.

But the options don't have a situation where ax could be zero and ay=g. Let me check the options.

Looking back at the options:

E: ax=0; ay=g

So when θ=90, that's the case. But in the problem, is θ necessarily less than 90? Because the incline is an incline, probably θ is less than 90 degrees.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify θ, so we have to consider all possible θ.

But wait, the car is moving up the incline without engine power. So at θ=90 degrees, the car would have to be moving straight up, but that would require an initial velocity upwards. But the problem says it's moving on level ground and reaches the foot of the incline. So θ would be less than 90 degrees, so the incline is a slope, not a vertical cliff.

So in this scenario, θ is between 0 and 90, but less than 90. So |ay| would be less than g because (sinθ)^2 <1.

Wait, but wait: when θ=90, |ay|=g, but the car can't be on a vertical incline in this scenario. So in this problem, θ is such that the incline is not vertical, so |ay| < g.

Therefore, both |ax| and |ay| are less than g.

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, when θ is 45 degrees, |ax| is g sinθ cosθ = g * (√2/2)(√2/2)= g*(0.5) = 0.5g. And |ay|=g*(sin45)^2= g*(0.5)=0.5g. So both are less than g.

But in another scenario, say θ approaching 0, like θ=30 degrees.

|ax|=g sin30 cos30 = g*(0.5)(√3/2)= g*(√3/4)= ~0.433g.

|ay|=g*(sin30)^2= g*(0.25)=0.25g.

So both are less than g.

Wait, but what about when θ approaches 90 degrees, but not exactly 90.

Say θ=80 degrees.

|ax|=g sin80 cos80.

sin80 is ~0.9848, cos80 ~0.1736.

So 0.9848 *0.1736 = ~0.1709; so |ax|=0.1709g ≈0.17g.

|ay|=g (sin80)^2= g*(0.9848)^2≈0.9698g.

So in this case, |ay| is ~0.97g, which is less than g, but close.

So in all cases where θ is less than 90 degrees, |ax| <g and |ay| <g.

Wait, but wait—when the car is on a slope, its acceleration is entirely along the slope, so in Earth's frame, the horizontal component is ax = a cosθ, and the vertical component is ay = a sinθ, but a is g sinθ. So wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should model this differently.

The net acceleration of the car is along the slope, which is a = g sinθ downward.

This acceleration vector is at an angle θ relative to the horizontal.

Wait, so the angle between the acceleration vector and the horizontal is θ. Because the slope is inclined at θ, so the acceleration along the slope is at θ relative to the horizontal.

Therefore, the horizontal component of acceleration is a cosθ, and the vertical component is a sinθ.

But a is g sinθ, so ax = (g sinθ) cosθ = g sinθ cosθ.

ay = (g sinθ) sinθ = g (sinθ)^2.

So, ax = g sinθ cosθ, ay = g (sinθ)^2.

Now, since θ is between 0 and 90 degrees:

sinθ cosθ is always less than or equal to 0.5 (since maximum at θ=45, yields 0.5).

So, ax can be up to 0.5g, but usually less.

Similarly, (sinθ)^2 is always less than or equal to 1. So ay can be up to g, but only when θ=90, which in this problem's case, θ is less than 90, so ay is less than g.

Wait, but in the case when the incline is at θ=90, the car is moving straight up, but that's not an incline anymore, so θ must be less than 90. So in this problem, ay is less than g.

So both ax and ay are less than g.

Wait, but that can't be right because when θ=90, ax would be zero, and ay would be g.

But in the problem, θ is an incline, so less than 90. So ay < g.

So both ax and ay are less than g.

Wait, but let's consider this: ax is along the direction of the slope's projection on the horizontal. So, for example, if θ is 30 degrees, then ax is g sin30 cos30 = 0.5g*(√3/2)= (√3/4)g ≈ 0.433g.

And ay is g (sin30)^2= 0.25g.

So both components are less than g.

So in this case, ax < g, ay < g.

Looking at the options, option C is ax <g, ay <g.

Option C: ax < g; ay < g.

So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but let me double-check. Are there any other possibilities?

Another approach: when the car is on the incline, the only acceleration is due to gravity along the slope. So the acceleration in Earth's frame is a vector that has both horizontal and vertical components, each less than g.

Because the maximum possible value for either component would be when the acceleration is entirely in that direction, but here it's split.

So, ax can't be equal to or greater than g, because a = g sinθ, which is less than g (since sinθ <1 for θ <90). And when a is resolved into components, each component is a fraction of a, hence each less than g.

So yeah, both ax and ay are less than g. So the correct option is C.

To analyze the horizontal acceleration \(a_x\) and vertical acceleration \(a_y\) of a car coasting up an incline of angle \(\theta\) without engine power, we consider the following:

1. **Forces Acting on the Car**:  
   The only forces acting on the car are gravity and the normal force. Since friction and air resistance are neglected, the net acceleration is due to gravity. The component of gravity along the incline is \(g \sin\theta\), which causes the car to decelerate as it moves up the slope.

2. **Coordinate System**:  
   The problem asks for the horizontal (\(a_x\)) and vertical (\(a_y\)) accelerations in the Earth's frame, not the incline's frame
