Okay, so I've got this differential equation problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the smallest T such that the absolute value of u(t) is less than or equal to 0.1 for all t > T. The initial value problem is given as 5u'' + 2u' +7u = 0, with u(0) = 2 and u'(0) = 1. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I remember that this is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. The standard approach is to find the characteristic equation and solve for its roots. The characteristic equation should be 5r² + 2r +7 = 0. Let me write that down.

So, the characteristic equation is 5r² + 2r +7 = 0. To find the roots, I'll use the quadratic formula: r = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)]/(2a). Here, a=5, b=2, c=7. Plugging in the values:

Discriminant D = (2)^2 -4*5*7 = 4 - 140 = -136. Oh, wait, the discriminant is negative, which means the roots are complex. So the solution will involve exponential functions multiplied by sine and cosine terms.

Since the roots are complex, they can be written as α ± βi, where α is the real part and β is the imaginary part. Let me compute alpha and beta.

The real part α is -b/(2a) = -2/(2*5) = -2/10 = -0.2. The imaginary part β is sqrt(|D|)/(2a) = sqrt(136)/(10). Wait, sqrt(136) is sqrt(4*34) = 2*sqrt(34), so beta is (2*sqrt(34))/10 = sqrt(34)/5 ≈ 5.830/5 ≈ 1.166.

So the general solution should be u(t) = e^(α t) [C1 cos(β t) + C2 sin(β t)], where C1 and C2 are constants determined by initial conditions.

Plugging in α = -0.2 and β ≈1.166, the solution becomes u(t) = e^(-0.2 t) [C1 cos(1.166 t) + C2 sin(1.166 t)].

Now, I need to apply the initial conditions to find C1 and C2. The initial conditions are u(0) = 2 and u'(0) = 1.

First, u(0) = 2. Let's plug t=0 into the solution:

u(0) = e^(0) [C1 cos(0) + C2 sin(0)] = 1*(C1*1 + C2*0) = C1. So C1 = 2.

Next, find u'(t). Let's compute the derivative of u(t):

u'(t) = d/dt [e^(-0.2 t) (C1 cos(β t) + C2 sin(β t)) ] 
= e^(-0.2 t) (-0.2)(C1 cos(β t) + C2 sin(β t)) 
+ e^(-0.2 t) [ -C1 β sin(β t) + C2 β cos(β t) ]

At t=0, u'(0) is:

u'(0) = e^0 [ -0.2*(C1*1 + C2*0) ) + ( -C1 β *0 + C2 β *1 ) ]
= 1 * [ -0.2*C1 + C2 β ]

We know u'(0)=1, so:

-0.2 * C1 + C2 β = 1.

We already have C1=2, so plugging that in:

-0.2 *2 + C2 β = 1 → -0.4 + C2 β =1 → C2 β =1.4 → C2 = 1.4 / β.

We found β = sqrt(34)/5 ≈1.166, so C2 = 1.4 / (sqrt(34)/5) = (1.4 *5)/sqrt(34) =7/sqrt(34) ≈7/5.830≈1.20185.

So putting it all together, the solution is:

u(t)= e^(-0.2 t) [2 cos(1.166 t) + 1.20185 sin(1.166 t)].

Now, I need to find the smallest T such that |u(t)| ≤0.1 for all t > T.

Hmm, since the exponential term is decaying (because the exponent is negative), the solution will tend to zero as t increases. The oscillations from the sine and cosine terms will have decreasing amplitude. So eventually, u(t) will stay within 0.1.

To find T, I'll need to find when the envelope of the function drops below 0.1. The envelope is given by the exponential multiplied by the amplitude of the oscillations. Wait, the maximum of |u(t)| is the exponential times the amplitude of the sinusoidal part.

The amplitude of the sinusoidal part is sqrt(C1² + C2²). Let me compute that.

C1=2, C2≈1.20185. So the amplitude is sqrt( (2)^2 + (1.20185)^2 ) = sqrt(4 + 1.444) ≈ sqrt(5.444) ≈2.332.

So the envelope is e^(-0.2 t) * 2.332. We want this envelope to be less than or equal to 0.1.

So set 2.332 e^(-0.2 T) = 0.1.

Solving for T:

e^(-0.2 T) = 0.1 / 2.332 ≈0.042916.

Take natural log on both sides:

-0.2 T = ln(0.042916) → T = - ln(0.042916)/0.2.

Compute ln(0.042916): let's see, ln(0.04) is about -3.2189, 0.042916 is a bit larger, so ln(0.042916) ≈-3.15 perhaps. Let me compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, 0.042916 is approximately e^-3.15, since e^-3 is about 0.0498, e^-3.15 is e^(-3) * e^(-0.15) ≈0.0498 * 0.8607≈0.0428, which is very close. So ln(0.042916) ≈-3.15.

So T≈3.15 / 0.2 = 15.75.

Wait, but the options don't have 15.75. Let me check the exact calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Compute 0.1 /2.332 = 0.042916.

Compute ln(0.042916). Let me use a calculator approach.

0.042916 is 4.2916e-2.

ln(4.2916e-2) = ln(4.2916) + ln(1e-2) = ln(4.2916) - 2 ln(10).

ln(4.2916) is approximately 1.457. Because e^1=2.718, e^1.4≈4.055, e^1.45≈4.26, so 1.457 is correct (since 1.457 gives around 4.29).

Then, ln(10) is about 2.302585. So 2*ln(10) is 4.60517.

So ln(4.2916e-2) = 1.457 - 4.60517 ≈-3.148.

Thus, ln(0.042916) ≈-3.148.

So T = (- (-3.148 )) / 0.2 = 3.148 / 0.2 = 15.74.

Wait, so T is approximately 15.74. But let me check the options given.

Looking at the options:

A:18.6543

B:8.9765

C:11.1111

D:10.1234

E:14.5115

F:22.2222

G:9.8765

H:16.7890

I:12.3456

J:20.2020

So the closest higher value to 15.74 is option E:14.5115, which is a bit lower, and option H:16.789, which is higher.

Wait, but wait. Because the envelope is 2.332 e^{-0.2 t}, and we set this equal to 0.1. But the actual function u(t) could be lower than the envelope earlier because of the oscillations. So perhaps T is the time when the envelope reaches 0.1, but the actual function might have dipped below 0.1 earlier. But the question asks for T such that for all t > T, |u(t)| ≤0.1. So T must be when the envelope is 0.1 because beyond that point, the function won't exceed 0.1 again.

So our calculation gives T≈15.74. But none of the options exactly match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the initial steps.

The amplitude was sqrt(2^2 + (7/sqrt(34))^2). Wait, because earlier I computed C2 as 7/sqrt(34) ≈1.20185.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

C2 = 1.4 / (sqrt(34)/5) = (1.4 *5)/sqrt(34) =7/sqrt(34).

So sqrt(34) is approximately 5.83095.

So 7/sqrt(34) ≈7/5.83095≈1.20185.

So the amplitude is sqrt(2^2 + (7/sqrt(34))^2 )= sqrt(4 + (49/34)).

Wait, 49/34 is approximately 1.4412. So 4 +1.4412=5.4412. So sqrt(5.4412)=2.332.

So that part is correct.

So the envelope is 2.332 e^{-0.2 t}.

Set 2.332 e^{-0.2 T} =0.1 → e^{-0.2 T}=0.1/2.332≈0.042916.

Taking natural logs: -0.2 T = ln(0.042916) → T = - ln(0.042916)/0.2.

Compute ln(0.042916): Let me compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, using a calculator, 0.042916 is approximately 4.2916 ×10^-2.

Compute ln(4.2916e-2):

We can compute this as ln(4.2916) + ln(1e-2) = ln(4.2916) - 2*ln(10).

ln(4.2916) is approximately 1.457 (since e^1.457 ≈4.2916).

ln(10)=2.302585, so 2*ln(10)=4.60517.

So ln(4.2916e-2)=1.457 -4.60517≈-3.14817.

So T=3.14817 /0.2 =15.74085.

So approximately 15.74. Looking at the options, the closest option is E:14.5115 and H:16.7890. Hmm, 15.74 is between E and H. So perhaps I missed something.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate more accurately the value of ln(0.042916).

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the amplitude.

Alternatively, perhaps using the exact value would give a more precise T. Let me try to compute without approximating beta and C2.

Wait, the exact expression for C2 is 7/sqrt(34). So the amplitude is sqrt(4 + (7/sqrt(34))^2 )= sqrt(4 + 49/34) = sqrt( (136/34) + (49/34) )= sqrt(185/34)=sqrt(185)/sqrt(34).

So the amplitude is sqrt(185/34) ≈ sqrt(5.441)≈2.332, same as before.

So the envelope is 2.332 e^{-0.2 t}.

So solving 2.332 e^{-0.2 T}=0.1.

Taking natural log:

ln(2.332) -0.2 T ln(e) = ln(0.1) → Wait, no. Let me correct that.

Wait, 2.332 e^{-0.2 T} = 0.1.

Take ln of both sides:

ln(2.332) + (-0.2 T) = ln(0.1).

So, -0.2 T = ln(0.1) - ln(2.332).

Compute ln(0.1)≈-2.302585.

ln(2.332): e^0.85 is about 2.34, so ln(2.332)≈0.85.

Thus, ln(0.1) - ln(2.332)≈-2.3026 -0.85≈-3.1526.

So, -0.2 T = -3.1526 → T=3.1526/0.2=15.632.

Wait, so about 15.63. So the previous approximation was 15.74, now it's 15.63. Hmm, why the difference? Oh because I approximated ln(2.332)=0.85. Let me compute ln(2.332) more accurately.

What's e^0.85? e^0.8 is 2.2255, e^0.85≈2.34 (as I thought earlier). So ln(2.332) is very close to 0.85.

Alternatively, using a calculator, ln(2.332)=0.8507.

So ln(2.332)=0.8507.

So, -0.2 T = ln(0.1) - ln(2.332) = (-2.302585) - 0.8507 ≈-3.1533.

So T=3.1533 /0.2≈15.7665.

So T≈15.77. Now, looking at the options, none have this exact value. So perhaps I miscalculated the initial part.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that u(t) can be written in terms of amplitude and phase shift. Let me think about that.

Alternatively, perhaps using the exact expression for the solution to find when |u(t)|=0.1.

But that might be complicated because it's a combination of sine and cosine. So the envelope approach gives an upper bound, but the actual |u(t)| could be less than that, depending on the phase.

But since the problem asks for T such that |u(t)|≤0.1 for all t>T, we should consider the envelope because the maximum possible |u(t)| is given by the envelope. So when the envelope is below 0.1, u(t) will certainly be below that.

So if the envelope is 0.1 at T≈15.77, then for t > T, the envelope is less than 0.1, so |u(t)| will be ≤0.1.

But looking at the options, the closest higher value is H:16.789, and the closest lower is E:14.5115. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should compute beta more accurately. Earlier, I approximated beta as sqrt(34)/5.

Wait, the roots are (-2 ± sqrt( -136 ))/(2*5) = (-2 ± i sqrt(136))/(10) → so beta = sqrt(136)/10.

Wait, wait, wait! I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-calculate beta.

The characteristic equation is 5r² + 2r +7=0.

The roots are [ -2 ± sqrt( (2)^2 -4*5*7 ) ]/(2*5) → [ -2 ± sqrt(4-140) ]/(10) → [ -2 ± sqrt(-136) ]/(10) → [ -2 ± i sqrt(136) ]/10.

So the imaginary part is sqrt(136)/10. Wait, earlier I said beta was sqrt(34)/5, but that's incorrect. Because sqrt(136)=sqrt(4*34)=2*sqrt(34). So sqrt(136)/10 = (2*sqrt(34))/10 = sqrt(34)/5 ≈5.830/5≈1.166. So beta is correct as 1.166.

So that part is correct.

Wait, but let's recheck the amplitude. The general solution is u(t)=e^{at} [ C1 cos(bt) + C2 sin(bt) ].

The maximum amplitude is sqrt(C1^2 + C2^2) multiplied by e^{at}, but since a is negative, the envelope decays.

So, in our case, a=-0.2, so the envelope is decaying as e^{-0.2 t} multiplied by the amplitude sqrt(C1^2 + C2^2).

So the maximum |u(t)| is sqrt(C1² + C2²) e^{-0.2 t}.

So to find when this is 0.1, solve for t in sqrt(C1² + C2²) e^{-0.2 t} =0.1.

We have C1=2, C2=7/sqrt(34).

So sqrt( (2)^2 + (7/sqrt(34))^2 ) = sqrt(4 + 49/34) = sqrt( (136 +49)/34 )= sqrt(185/34) = sqrt(5.441)≈2.332.

So 2.332 e^{-0.2 t}=0.1.

Take natural logs:

ln(2.332) -0.2 t = ln(0.1).

Which gives t= [ ln(2.332) - ln(0.1) ] / 0.2.

Compute ln(2.332)=0.8507, ln(0.1)=-2.302585.

So numerator=0.8507 - (-2.302585)=3.153285.

So t=3.153285 /0.2≈15.7664.

So T≈15.77.

Looking at the options, the closest higher value is H:16.7890. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake
