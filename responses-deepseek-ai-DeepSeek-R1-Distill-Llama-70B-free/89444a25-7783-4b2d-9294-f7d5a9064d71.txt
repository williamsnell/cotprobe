Okay, so I have this question about calculating the binding energy of a hydrogen atom in its ground state. Hmm, I remember that binding energy is the energy required to remove an electron from the atom, right? Or wait, is it the energy that holds the nucleus and electron together?

I think the ground state is the lowest energy level the electron can occupy. Oh right, Bohr model stuff. The formula for the binding energy comes into play here. I recall something involving Rydberg's constant or maybe the ionization energy.

Wait, the binding energy is the energy needed to ionize the atom, which is the same as the ionization energy. For hydrogen, the ionization energy in the ground state is 13.6 eV. Oh yeah, that's a famous number. So the binding energy should be 13.6 eV.

Looking at the options, option G is 13.6 eV. So the answer should be G.

The binding energy of the hydrogen atom in its ground state is the energy required to remove the electron from the atom, which is equivalent to the ionization energy. This value is a well-known constant of 13.6 eV. Among the given options, the correct choice is:

G: 13.6 eV

Answer: G
