Okay, so I have this economics question about the free rider problem and what the government can do to avoid it. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, what is the free rider problem? From what I remember, it's when people benefit from a good or service but don't pay for it, expecting others to cover the costs. This usually happens with public goods because they're non-excludable and non-rival. Like, if someone doesn't pay taxes but still uses public roads, they're a free rider.

The question is asking what the government can do to most effectively avoid this problem. The options are A through J. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Supply public goods using tax dollars. That makes sense because if the government funds public goods through taxes, everyone contributes, so people can't really free ride. They have to pay taxes whether they use the good or not, but since public goods are for everyone, this might solve the issue.

Option B: Initiate a lottery system for usage. Wait, a lottery would mean some people get to use the goods and others don't. But public goods are supposed to be available to everyone, so this might not work. Plus, it doesn't address the funding issue, just access.

Option C: Enact stricter antitrust legislation. Antitrust is about preventing monopolies and promoting competition. Not sure how that ties into the free rider problem. Maybe unrelated here.

Option D: Increase prices of public goods. But public goods are usually non-excludable, so you can't really charge for them. If you try, people might still use them without paying, leading to free riders again. Doesn't seem effective.

Option E: Allow private companies to supply public goods. Private companies would need to make a profit, which might lead them to charge for the goods. But since public goods are non-excludable, people could still free ride, and private companies might underprovide because they can't capture all the benefits. So this might not solve the problem.

Option F: Tax those creating negative externalities. That's more about dealing with externalities, like pollution. It doesn't directly address free riding on public goods. So probably not the answer.

Option G: Ban the use of public goods. That seems extreme and not a solution. Banning wouldn't help because the problem is people not paying, not the use itself.

Option H: Provide more complete information about the goods. Information might help in some cases, but I'm not sure how it directly stops free riding. If people know more about the benefits, maybe they'll contribute, but without a mechanism to enforce payment, free riders can still exist.

Option I: Reduce production of public goods. That would make the problem worse because fewer goods would mean even more congestion or overuse, leading to more free riders. Doesn't help.

Option J: Encourage voluntary contributions. This is tricky. Voluntary contributions rely on people's goodwill. But in practice, people tend to under-contribute because they think others will pay, leading to the free rider problem. So this doesn't effectively solve it.

So the best option seems to be A. The government supplying public goods through taxes ensures that everyone contributes, preventing free riding because you can't opt out of paying taxes (well, legally, anyway). This way, the goods are provided without reliance on individual contributions, which is where free riders are a problem.

The free rider problem arises when individuals benefit from a good or service but do not contribute to its cost, often occurring with public goods due to their non-excludable and non-rival nature. To address this, the government can ensure funding through taxes, making everyone contribute. This approach prevents free riding by eliminating the option to opt out of payment. 

- **Option A** is effective because taxing ensures universal contribution, aligning with the nature of public goods.  
- Other options either fail to address the funding issue, introduce inefficiencies, or are unrelated to the problem.  

Thus, the best solution is for the government to supply public goods using tax dollars.
