Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about strict product liability. Hmm, let's see. The question is about Bill suing Ajax Minimart after finding dead insects in his Sipep can. The key here is to remember what elements are required in a strict product liability claim.

I remember that strict liability applies when a product has a defect that makes it unreasonably dangerous. The plaintiff needs to show that the product was defective, that the defect caused their injury, and that the defendant is part of the chain of commerce. 

So, the options given are from A to J. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Ajax failed to warn Bill about insects. Wait, failure to warn is more about negligence, like in cases where the product has known risks that aren't communicated. But in strict liability, the main focus is on the defect itself, not necessarily the warning. So maybe A isn't the right answer here unless the case specifically hinges on a failure to warn, but I'm not sure yet.

Option B: Ajax had prior notice of similar problems. Prior notice might be relevant in negligence to show a pattern, but in strict liability, the key is the defect, not whether the defendant knew about past issues. So B might not be required.

Option C: Ajax actually placed the insects. That seems too specific. Strict liability doesn't require proof that the defendant was negligent or intentionally placed the defect. It's about the product being defective, not who caused it. So C is probably incorrect.

Option D: The insects caused physical harm. Wait, in strict liability, the plaintiff must show that the defect caused their injury. So if the insects caused Bill harm, that's necessary. But the question says Bill just noticed the insects after drinking. Did he suffer any harm? If he didn't consume the insects or get sick, maybe there's no physical harm. But the question is about what Bill must prove, so maybe he needs to show causation. But I'm not certain if D is the right choice.

Option E: Ajax is a merchant selling Sipep. Ah, yes! In strict liability, the plaintiff must show that the defendant is in the business of selling such products. So Ajax, being a minimart, would qualify as a merchant. This is a key element because strict liability applies to commercial sellers, not just manufacturers. So E seems important.

Option F: Ajax knew or should have known of the defect. That sounds more like negligence again. Strict liability is about the existence of the defect, not the seller's knowledge. So F might not be necessary.

Option G: The can was sealed when purchased. This is about the product being in its original condition. If the product was tampered with after sale, the seller might not be liable. So proving the can was sealed shows that the defect was present when sold. This is probably a necessary element.

Option H: Bill consumed the entire can before noticing. I don't think this matters. What matters is that the product was defective when sold. Whether he consumed it all doesn't directly impact strict liability, unless it relates to damages, but the question is about what must be proven in the action.

Option I: Ajax had a duty to inspect each can. Again, this sounds like negligence. Strict liability doesn't require proof of a duty to inspect; it's about the product's condition. So I is probably not required.

Option J: Ajax is the manufacturer. Wait, no. Because in strict liability, not only manufacturers but also retailers and distributors can be held liable. So the plaintiff doesn't need to prove that the defendant is the manufacturer, just that they are part of the chain of commerce. So J is not necessary.

So, putting it together. The question asks what Bill must prove, among other things. So, the necessary elements would include that the product was defective, that the defect caused harm, and that the defendant is a commercial seller.

Looking back, option E says Ajax is a merchant selling Sipep. That's one of the elementsâ€”being in the business of selling. So E is probably correct. Also, option G, that the can was sealed, shows the product was as sold, so that might be another required element. Wait, but the question is phrased as "among other things," so perhaps only one of these is correct.

In strict liability, the plaintiff must prove that the product had a defect when it left the defendant's hands, which could be shown by the can being sealed. So G might be necessary. But the question is about what Bill must prove, so perhaps both E and G are involved. But the options are each separate, so the question is which one is correct.

Wait, but the question is about proving "among other things," so it's possible that more than one option is correct. However, the question is a multiple-choice with only one correct answer. So I need to determine which of these is a necessary element.

The elements of a strict product liability claim are:

1. The defendant is a commercial supplier (manufacturer, retailer, etc.) in the business of selling such products.
2. The product was defective when it left the defendant's control.
3. The defect caused the plaintiff's injury.

So, for element 1, option E is correct. For element 2, the fact that the can was sealed (option G) would help show that the defect was present when sold, but perhaps that's more about the defect itself. Alternatively, the presence of insects would indicate the defect, but the can being sealed would show that it wasn't tampered with after leaving the seller.

Wait, but the can being sealed isn't necessarily required. For example, if the product was defective but the packaging was intact, then it's a defect. But in some cases, the sealed container is important to show that the product wasn't altered after sale.

Hmm, but in this case, the question is about what Bill must prove. So, in a strict liability claim, the plaintiff must show that the product was defective when it left the defendant's hands. The fact that the can was sealed when purchased by Bill helps establish that the defect (the insects) were present when sold by Ajax, because it's in the original packaging.

So, option G would be something Bill needs to prove. Alternatively, the fact that Ajax is a merchant (option E) is also necessary.

Wait, the question is phrased as "must prove, among other things, that:" So more than one thing is needed, but the question is asking which of the options is one of the things he must prove.

So, considering that, both E and G are correct elements, but the options are presented as separate choices.

In the options given, the correct answer is E and G. But the options are each separate, so perhaps both E and G are correct, but in the multiple-choice, only one can be selected.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Option E is about Ajax being a merchant, which is a necessary element. Option G is about the can being sealed, which helps to show that the defect was present when sold. So both are correct, but the question is which one is required.

Wait, but the question is in the context of strict liability. To establish strict liability against a retailer, the plaintiff must show that the retailer is a commercial seller. So E is definitely required.

As for G, the can being sealed is more about causation and the defect existing at the time of sale. But perhaps the question is testing that aspect.

Wait, let me think about the elements again. The elements for strict product liability are:

- The product was defective.
- The defect existed when the product left the defendant's hands.
- The product was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury.

So, to prove the defect existed when the product left the defendant, the plaintiff might need to show that the product was in its original condition. Hence, G would be necessary.

But in the options, E is also necessary. So which one is correct?

Wait, the question is phrased as "Bill must prove, among other things, that:", so both E and G are correct. But looking at the options, perhaps E is the correct answer because it's about the defendant being a merchant, which is a necessary element in strict liability. The can being sealed (G) is more about evidence of the defect, but maybe it's not a required element per se, unless the product could have been tampered with.

But considering the options, the primary elements are that the defendant is a commercial supplier (E), the product was defective, and that the defect caused harm. So, E is definitely one of the things he must prove.

So, among the options, E is correct. But wait, looking back, the options are A to J, and I think the correct answer is E and G. But let me check if the question is only about one of them.

Wait, the question is a single correct answer, so I need to pick the best option.

Another angle: In strict liability, it's not necessary for the plaintiff to prove that the seller knew or should have known (F is out). The plaintiff doesn't need to prove that the seller placed the insects (C is out). The plaintiff doesn't need to prove prior notice (B is out). The plaintiff does need to prove that the product was defective, which in this case is the insects being present. But the question is about what Bill must prove, so perhaps the can being sealed (G) helps establish that the defect was present at the time of sale. Alternatively, that Ajax is a merchant (E) is necessary.

Wait, but if the can wasn't sealed, does that affect the claim? If the can was opened before, perhaps the defect was introduced after sale. So, to prove the defect was present when sold, the can being sealed is important. So G is necessary.

But wait, the can being sealed is more of a factual detail to support the claim, not an element that must be proven. The elements are more about the defendant being a seller, the product being defective, and causation.

So, perhaps E is correct because it's an essential element of strict liability that the defendant is a commercial supplier. Without proving that, the claim fails.

So, the answer should be E and G, but since it's multiple-choice, I think E is the correct choice. Alternatively, perhaps G is also correct.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline the elements again.

Strict Product Liability requires:

1. The defendant is a commercial supplier (manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer) in the business of selling such products. So E is correct.

2. The product was defective, making it unreasonably dangerous. The presence of insects would be a defect, but the question doesn't ask about proving the defect, so E is about the supplier.

3. The defect caused the plaintiff's injury. But the question isn't about that; it's about what Bill must prove, so D would be about causation, but the question is about other elements.

So, in the options, E is one of the required elements. G is more about the condition of the product when sold, which ties into the defect existing at that time.

So, the correct answer would include E and possibly G. But since the options are separate, I think E is the correct answer because it's a fundamental element, whereas G is more of a factual detail to support the defect's existence at sale.

Alternatively, perhaps G is necessary because it shows that the product was not tampered with after being sold, thus the defect was present when sold. So G is also a necessary element.

But in the strictest sense, the elements are about the defendant being a commercial supplier, the product being defective, and the defect causing injury. So E is definitely required.

Wait, but the question is about what Bill must prove. So, he must prove that Ajax is a merchant (E), and that the product was defective (insects) when it left Ajax, which would be shown by the can being sealed (G). But the question is phrased as "among other things," so perhaps both E and G are required, but since the options are separate, only one can be chosen.

In bar exam questions, typically, in strict liability, the plaintiff must prove that the product was defective when it left the defendant's control. To show that, the product being in its original packaging (sealed) is important, especially if the product could have been tampered with after sale. So G is necessary.

But I'm a bit torn between E and G. However, E is a more fundamental element because without being a commercial supplier, the defendant isn't strictly liable. So E is definitely required.

Wait, but in the fact pattern, Ajax is the minimart where Bill bought it, so it's a retailer. Therefore, E is correct because Ajax is a merchant.

So, I think the correct answer is E and G. But the options are separate, so perhaps the correct answer is both E and G. But the question is to select one option.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E: Ajax is a merchant selling Sipep.

Alternatively, the question asks what Bill must prove, so E is about the defendant's status, and G is about the product's condition. Both are necessary, but in the options, which one is correct.

In the context of the question, the correct answer is E and G. But since only one can be selected, I think E is more about the element, whereas G is more about evidence.

Wait, but the question is asking "must prove, among other things," so perhaps both E and G are correct, but in the options, only one is presented as correct.

I think the correct answer is E: Ajax is a merchant selling Sipep. So the answer is E.
</think>

In a strict product liability claim, the plaintiff must prove certain key elements: 

1. **The defendant is a commercial supplier**: This means the defendant must be in the business of selling the type of product in question. This is a fundamental element because strict liability applies to commercial suppliers, not just manufacturers. In this case, Ajax is a minimart, which qualifies as a merchant selling Sipep. Therefore, Bill must prove that Ajax is a merchant (Option E).

2. **The product was defective when it left the defendant's control**: This can be shown by evidence that the product was in its original condition, such as being sealed (Option G). The sealed can would help establish that the defect (the insects) was present when the product was sold, as it was not tampered with after leaving Ajax.

3. **The defect caused the plaintiff's injury**: While this is another required element, the question does not focus on this aspect.

Among the options provided, **Option E** is the most critical because it establishes Ajax's status as a commercial supplier, which is a necessary element of strict liability. While Option G (the can being sealed) is important to show the defect existed at the time of sale, it is more of a factual detail supporting the defect's presence. Since the question asks for what Bill must prove "among other things," and only one option can be selected, **Option E** is the best answer.
