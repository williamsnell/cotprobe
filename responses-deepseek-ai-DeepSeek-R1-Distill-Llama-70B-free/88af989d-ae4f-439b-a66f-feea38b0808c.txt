Okay, so I've got this complex integral to evaluate. The integral is ∫c 1/(z² + 4)² dz, right? And the contour is a circle centered at (0, i) with a diameter of 3, going counter-clockwise. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that for complex integrals, especially around contours, the Residue Theorem is usually the way to go. The Residue Theorem says that the integral around a closed contour is 2πi times the sum of the residues inside the contour. So I need to find the residues of the function inside the circle.

The function is 1/(z² +4)². Let me factor the denominator: z² +4 = (z + 2)(z - 2). Wait, no, wait. Wait, z² +4 can be written as (z - 2i)(z + 2i) because 2i squared is -4. So the denominator becomes (z - 2i)^2 (z + 2i)^2? Wait no, wait, wait. Wait, wait, the function is 1/(z² +4)^2. So that's (z² +4) squared in the denominator. So the denominator is (z² +4)^2 = (z - 2i)^2 (z + 2i)^2. So the function has two double poles at z=2i and z=-2i.

So the singularities are at 2i and -2i. Now, I need to find which of these points lie inside the contour C. The contour is a circle centered at (0,i) with diameter 3, so the radius is 3/2 = 1.5 units. So the circle is centered at (0,1) in the complex plane (since i is the imaginary unit, so the center is (0,1)).

Wait, no. Wait, the center is (0, i), which in the (Re, Im) plane would be (0,1) because i is the unit in the imaginary direction. So the center is at (0,1) with radius 1.5.

Now, let's find the positions of the singularities relative to this circle.

First, the point z = 2i is (0,2) in the complex plane. The distance from the center (0,1) to (0,2) is |2i - i| = |i| = 1. So the distance is 1. Since the radius is 1.5, which is larger than 1, the point z=2i is inside the circle.

What about z=-2i? That's (0,-2) in the complex plane. The distance from (0,1) to (0,-2) is |-2i -i| = |-3i|=3. The radius is 1.5, so 3 > 1.5, so z=-2i is outside the contour C.

So only z=2i is inside the contour. That means the integral is 2πi times the residue at z=2i.

Wait, but wait. The function is 1/(z^2 +4)^2, which is 1/[(z-2i)^2 (z+2i)^2]. So at z=2i, it's a double pole, so the residue there would be calculated using the formula for a pole of order m. The general formula for residue at a pole of order m is (1/(m-1)!) ) * lim_{z->a} [d^{m-1}/dz^{m-1} ( (z-a)^m f(z) ) ].

So in this case, m=2. So the residue at z=2i would be (1/(2-1)!) * lim_{z->2i} d/dz [ (z-2i)^2 * f(z) ].

Let me calculate that. (z-2i)^2 * f(z) is (z-2i)^2 * 1/( (z-2i)^2 (z+2i)^2 ) ) = 1/(z+2i)^2.

So we have to compute the first derivative of [1/(z+2i)^2] with respect to z, evaluated at z=2i.

The derivative of 1/(z+2i)^2 is -2/(z+2i)^3. So when z=2i, this becomes -2/(2i + 2i)^3 = -2/(4i)^3.

Wait, 4i cubed is (4i)^3 = 64 i^3 = 64 (-i) = -64i. So denominator is -64i. So the derivative is -2 / (-64i) = 2/(64i) = 1/(32i).

But wait, 1/i is -i, so 1/(32i) = -i/(32). So the residue is this value multiplied by 1/(1)! which is 1. So residue is -i/(32).

Wait, let me check my steps again. Because when I take the derivative, I have to be careful with signs.

Wait, the derivative of (z + 2i)^{-2} is -2(z+2i)^{-3}, yes. So at z=2i, z+2i = 4i, so the derivative is -2/(4i)^3.

Now, 4i^3 is 4*(i^2*i) = 4*(-1)*i = -4i. So 4i^3 = -4i. Wait, no, wait, 4i is 4i, so (4i)^3 is (4)^3 * i^3 = 64 * (-i) = -64i.

So the derivative is -2 / (-64i) = (2)/(64i) = 1/(32i) = -i/32.

So the residue at z=2i is -i/32.

Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute (4i)^3 again. 4i is 4 * e^{iπ/2}, so (4i)^3 is 4^3 * e^{i 3π/2} = 64 * e^{i 3π/2} = 64 (cos(3π/2) + i sin(3π/2)) ) = 64 (0 -i) = -64i. So (4i)^3 = -64i. So 1/(4i)^3 = 1/(-64i) = -1/(64i) = i/(64), since 1/i = -i.

Wait, so -2/(4i)^3 = -2 * (1/(-64i)) ) = -2 * (-i/64) ) = (2i)/64 = i/32.

Wait, wait, but earlier I thought it was -i/32. Hmm, maybe I messed up the signs.

Wait, let's re-calculate:

The derivative is d/dz [1/(z+2i)^2] = -2/(z+2i)^3.

At z=2i, z+2i = 4i.

So, the derivative is -2/(4i)^3.

Compute (4i)^3: 4^3 = 64; i^3 = -i. So (4i)^3 = 64*(-i) = -64i.

Thus, -2/( -64i ) = (2)/(64i) = (1)/(32i).

But 1/i = -i, so 1/(32i) = -i/32.

So the derivative is -i/32.

So the residue is (1/(1!)) * (-i/32) ) = -i/32.

Wait, no: Wait, the formula says that the residue is (1/(m-1)! ) times the (m-1)th derivative of (z-a)^m f(z) evaluated at a. So m=2, so (m-1) is 1, so the first derivative.

So yes, the residue is -i/32.

So the integral is 2πi times this residue: 2πi * (-i/32) = 2πi * (-i)/32.

Compute this: 2πi * (-i) = 2π (i*(-i)) = 2π (1), since i*(-i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1.

So 2π * (1) / 32 = 2π/32 = π/16.

Wait, so the integral is π/16.

What is π/16 numerically? Let me compute that. π is approximately 3.14159. So π/16 ≈ 0.1963495.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.19634, which matches.

Wait, but let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, the function is 1/(z² +4)^2 = 1/[(z-2i)^2 (z+2i)^2]. The contour is centered at (0,1) with radius 1.5. So the point 2i is at (0,2), which is 1 unit away from the center. So it's inside the circle. The other point is at (0,-2), which is 3 units away from (0,1), which is outside the circle of radius 1.5.

So only residue at 2i counts.

Then, for a double pole at z=2i, the residue is calculated as (1/(1!)) * d/dz [ (z-2i)^2 * f(z) ] evaluated at z=2i.

(z-2i)^2 * f(z) = (z-2i)^2 * 1/( (z-2i)^2 (z+2i)^2 ) ) = 1/(z+2i)^2.

Taking derivative: d/dz [1/(z+2i)^2 ] = -2/(z+2i)^3.

At z=2i, denominator is (2i + 2i)^3 = (4i)^3 = -64i. So -2/(-64i) = 2/(64i) = 1/(32i) = -i/32.

So residue is (1) * (-i/32) = -i/32.

Then, integral = 2πi * (-i/32) = 2πi * (-i) /32 = (2π (i*(-i)) ) /32 = (2π (1)) /32 = 2π/32 = π/16 ≈ 0.19635, which is option B.

So the answer should be B.

To evaluate the integral \(\int_C \frac{1}{(z^2 + 4)^2} dz\) over the given contour, we use the Residue Theorem. The contour is a circle centered at \((0, i)\) with a diameter of 3, corresponding to a radius of 1.5. The function \(\frac{1}{(z^2 + 4)^2}\) has singularities at \(z = 2i\) and \(z = -2i\), which are double poles.

### Step 1: Identify singularities inside the contour
- The center of the circle is \((0, i)\), and the radius is 1.5.
- The point \(z = 2i\) is located at \((0, 2)\) in the complex plane. The distance from the center \((0, i)\) to \(z = 2i\) is \(|2i - i| = |i| = 1\), which is less than the radius of 1.5. Thus, \(z = 2i\) is inside the contour.
- The point \(z = -2i\) is located at \((0, -2)\). The distance from the center \((0, i)\) to \(z = -2i\) is \(|-2i - i| = |-3i| = 3\), which is greater than the radius of 1.5. Thus, \(z = -2i\) is outside the contour.

Only \(z = 2i\) lies inside the contour, so the integral depends solely on the residue at \(z = 2i\).

### Step 2: Calculate the residue at \(z = 2i\)
The function can be written as:
\[
\frac{1}{(z^2 + 4)^2} = \frac{1}{(z - 2i)^2 (z + 2i)^2}.
\]
At \(z = 2i\), the function has a double pole (\(m = 2\)). The residue at a pole of order \(m\) is given by:
\[
\text{Res}_{z = a} f(z) = \frac{1}{(m-1)!} \lim_{z \to a} \frac{d^{m-1}}{dz^{m-1}} \left[(z - a)^m f(z)\right].
\]
For \(m = 2\), this becomes:
\[
\text{Res}_{z = 2i} f(z) = \frac{1}{1!} \lim_{z \to 2i} \frac{d}{dz} \left[(z - 2i)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{(z - 2i)^2 (z + 2i)^2}\right].
\]
Simplifying:
\[
(z - 2i)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{(z - 2i)^2 (z + 2i)^2} = \frac{1}{(z + 2i)^2}.
\]
Now, compute the derivative:
\[
\frac{d}{dz} \left[\frac{1}{(z + 2i)^2}\right] = -\frac{2}{(z + 2i)^3}.
\]
At \(z = 2i\), \(z + 2i = 4i\), so:
\[
-\frac{2}{(4i)^3} = -\frac{2}{(64i^3)} = -\frac{2}{(-64i)} = \frac{2}{64i} = \frac{1}{32i}.
\]
Since \(1/i = -i\), this becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{32i} = -\frac{i}{32}.
\]
Thus, the residue at \(z = 2i\) is:
\[
\text{Res}_{z = 2i} f(z) = -\frac{i}{32}.
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate the integral
The Residue Theorem states that:
\[
\int_C f(z) dz = 2\pi i \cdot \text{Res}_{z = 2i} f(z).
\]
Substituting the residue:
\[
\int_C \frac{1}{(z^2 + 4)^2} dz = 2\pi i \cdot \left(-\frac{i}{32}\right) = 2\pi i \cdot \left(-\frac{i}{32}\right).
\]
Simplify:
\[
2\pi i \cdot \left(-\frac{i}{32}\right) = -\frac{2\pi i^2}{32} = -\frac{2\pi (-1)}{32} = \frac{2\pi}{32} = \frac{\pi}{16}.
\]
Numerically, \(\frac{\pi}{16} \approx 0.19635\).

### Final Answer:
The value of the integral is approximately \(0.19634\), which corresponds to **option B**.
