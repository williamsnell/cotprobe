Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric flux through a Gaussian cube. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem states: A particle of charge 1.8 microCoulombs is at the center of a Gaussian cube that's 55 centimeters on each edge. I need to find the net electric flux through the surface of the cube. The options are from A to J, each with different values.

Wait, what do I remember about Gaussian surfaces and electric flux? Oh right, Gauss's Law. Gauss's Law relates the electric flux through a closed surface to the charge enclosed by that surface. The formula is Φ = Q_enc / ε₀, where Φ is the electric flux, Q_enc is the enclosed charge, and ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity.

So the cube is a Gaussian surface here. Since the charge is at the center, it's entirely enclosed within the cube. That means all the electric field lines emanating from the charge will pass through the cube's surfaces. Wait, cubes have six faces, right? But when applying Gauss's Law, the symmetry of the cube ensures that the electric flux through each face is the same.

But wait, I think I might be overcomplicating. According to Gauss's Law, the total flux depends only on the enclosed charge, not on the shape of the surface. So even though the cube is a specific shape, the flux is just Q over ε₀.

Let me jot that down. Φ = Q_enc / ε₀. So Q_enc is 1.8 μC. Oh wait, micro is 1e-6. So Q is 1.8e-6 C.

What's the value of ε₀? I remember it's approximately 8.85e-12 C²/(N·m²). So plugging the numbers in:

Φ = (1.8e-6 C) / (8.85e-12 C²/(N·m²)).

Let me compute that. Let's see, 1.8e-6 divided by 8.85e-12 equals... Hmm, 1.8 divided by 8.85 is about 0.203. Then the exponents: 1e-6 / 1e-12 is 1e6. So 0.203 * 1e6 is 2.03e5.

Wait wait, but looking at the answer options, let me check.

Options are:

A: 2.2e5

B: 2.8e5

C: 3.2e5

D: 1.0e5

E: 1.5e5

F: 2.5e5

G: 3.0e5

H: 1.8e5

I: 4.0e5

J: 2.0e5

Hmm, I got approximately 2.03e5, which is closest to 2.0e5, which is option J. But wait, maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait let me redo the calculation more accurately. 1.8e-6 / 8.85e-12. Let's compute 1.8 /8.85 first. 8.85 goes into 1.8 how many times? 8.85 is about 8.85, so 0.2034 approximately. So 0.2034 times 1e6 is 2.034e5. So that's about 2.03e5, which is 2.0e5 when rounded to two significant figures.

Wait, but wait—does the cube's size matter? Oh wait, in Gauss's Law, the size of the Gaussian surface doesn't affect the flux as long as the charge is enclosed. Because electric flux depends only on the enclosed charge. The field strength would depend on distance, but flux through the entire surface is just Q/ε₀.

So, yeah, the size of the cube (55 cm edges) doesn't change the total flux. So my initial approach was correct.

Therefore, the correct answer should be approximately 2.0e5, which is option J.

Wait, but looking again, the options give J as 2.0e5, which matches. So the answer should be J.

To determine the net electric flux through the surface of the Gaussian cube, we apply **Gauss's Law**, which states:

\[
\Phi = \frac{Q_{\text{enc}}}{\epsilon_0}
\]

Here:
- \( Q_{\text{enc}} = 1.8 \, \mu\mathrm{C} = 1.8 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{C} \) (the charge enclosed by the cube),
- \( \epsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{C^2/(N \cdot m^2)} \) (the vacuum permittivity).

Substituting the values:

\[
\Phi = \frac{1.8 \times 10^{-6}}{8.85 \times 10^{-12}}
\]

First, calculate the ratio of the coefficients:

\[
\frac{1.8}{8.85} \approx 0.2034
\]

Next, account for the powers of 10:

\[
\frac{10^{-6}}{10^{-12}} = 10^6
\]

Thus:

\[
\Phi \approx 0.2034 \times 10^6 = 2.034 \times 10^5 \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2/C}
\]

This value is approximately \( 2.0 \times 10^5 \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2/C} \), which corresponds to **option J**. The size of the cube does not affect the result because Gauss's Law depends only on the enclosed charge, not the geometry of the Gaussian surface.
