Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about Butler's claim on rights. The question is asking what Butler said is the only thing anyone has a right to, strictly speaking. The options are from A to J, each representing a different concept like justice, security, liberty, etc.

First, I need to recall who Butler is. I think Joseph Butler was a bishop and philosopher, associated with the 18th-century Enlightenment. He wrote about ethics, theology, and human nature. I remember he had some ideas about conscience and the nature of human beings.

Butler's ethical theories emphasized the concept of conscience. He believed that humans have instincts, including self-love and particular affections, but that conscience is a higher principle that should govern our actions. Conscience, according to Butler, is a moral faculty that allows us to distinguish right from wrong.

Now, the question is about rights. Butler's view on rights might be tied to his ethical framework. I think he had a specific stance on what constitutes a right. I remember that Butler was critical of Hobbes, who argued that in the state of nature, life is solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short, and that the primary right is self-preservation.

Butler, on the other hand, might have a different perspective. Wait, I think he argued that the only natural right is the right to life. Because without life, other rights can't exist. Or maybe it's something else. Alternatively, I recall that Butler discussed that humans have a right to happiness, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, I think it's more about the right to life. Because life is fundamental. Without life, you can't have liberty, property, etc. So Butler might have said that strictly speaking, the only right is life.

Looking at the options, E is life, and I is happiness. I'm trying to remember which one it is. I think Butler actually said that the right to happiness is not strictly a right because it's too vague, but the right to life is more fundamental.

Alternatively, I might be confusing this with John Locke, who said life, liberty, and property are natural rights. But the question is about Butler, not Locke.

Another angle: Butler's Sermons. In his Sermons, he discusses self-love and conscience. He might have discussed rights in that context. I remember that Butler was cautious about the idea of natural rights, perhaps arguing that the only true right is life because it's essential for existence.

Wait, I think the correct answer is E: life. Because without life, you can't have any other rights. So Butler would argue that strictly speaking, life is the only right.

Butler, an 18th-century philosopher, emphasized conscience and ethical principles in his work. Among the options provided, the right to life stands out as the most fundamental, as it is essential for the existence of any other rights. Butler likely argued that life is the only strict right because without it, other rights such as liberty or property cannot exist. This aligns with the idea that life is a prerequisite for all other aspects of human experience.

Answer: E
