Question:

What is the magnitude of the vector v = (5, 0, 7)?

Options:

A: 6.0
B: 12.0
C: 10.0
D: 0
E: 5.7
F: 3.5
G: 7.5
H: 8.6
I: 9.2
J: 4.2

Answer:
    <think>


To determine the magnitude of the vector \( \mathbf{v} = (5, 0, 7) \), we use the formula for the magnitude of a vector in three-dimensional space:

\[
\|\mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2}
\]

Substituting the given components:

\[
\|\mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{5^2 + 0^2 + 7^2} = \sqrt{25 + 0 + 49} = \sqrt{74}
\]

The value of \( \sqrt{74} \) is approximately \( 8.6 \). Comparing this result with the provided options, the correct answer is:

**H: 8.6**

Answer: H
