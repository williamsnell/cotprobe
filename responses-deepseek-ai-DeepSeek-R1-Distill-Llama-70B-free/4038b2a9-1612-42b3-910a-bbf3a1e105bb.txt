Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Cavendish balance. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives me the mass of a small sphere and a large sphere. The small one is 0.0100 kg, and the large is 0.500 kg. The distance between their centers is 0.0500 meters. I'm supposed to find the gravitational force between them, which will be X times 10^-10 Newtons. Then I need to pick the correct X from the options.

Wait, right, gravitational force is calculated using Newton's law of universal gravitation. The formula is F = G*(m1*m2)/r². Oh yeah, G is the gravitational constant. I think G is approximately 6.67 × 10^-11 N·m²/kg². Let me make sure I remember that correctly.

So plugging in the numbers, m1 is 0.0100 kg, m2 is 0.500 kg. Multiplying those gives 0.005 kg². Let me calculate that: 0.01 * 0.5 is 0.005. Then the distance r is 0.05 meters, so r squared is (0.05)^2 which is 0.0025 m².

Putting it all together: F = (6.67e-11) * (0.005) / (0.0025). Let me compute the numerator first. 6.67e-11 times 0.005 is... 6.67e-11 * 5e-3. Oh wait, 0.005 is 5e-3. So 6.67 *5 is about 33.35, so 33.35e-14 (because 1e-11 *1e-3 is 1e-14). So that's 3.335e-13.

Wait wait, no. Let me recalculate that. 6.67e-11 times 0.005 is 6.67e-11 * 5e-3. 6.67 *5 is 33.35, and the exponents: 1e-11 *1e-3 is 1e-14. So 33.35e-14 is 3.335e-13.

Then, divide that by 0.0025, which is 2.5e-3. So F = (3.335e-13) / (2.5e-3) ) = (3.335 / 2.5) )e-10.

3.335 divided by 2.5 is... Let's see, 2.5 goes into 3 once, with 1.335 left. 1.335 /2.5 is 0.534. So total is 1.534. So 1.534e-10 N.

Wait, but the problem says the force is X*1e-10 N. So X is approximately 1.534. Looking at the options, I don't see 1.53, but let me check the options again.

Options given are A:2.67, B:1.33, C:0.89, D:1.75, E:1.50, F:0.67, G:3.00, H:0.50, I:2.10, J:2.45.

Hmm, closest to 1.53 would be E:1.50 or D:1.75. Wait, but wait, maybe I made a calculation error.

Let me recalculate more accurately.

F = G*(m1*m2)/(r^2)

G=6.674×10^-11 N·m²/kg² (I think I used 6.67 before, maybe precise value is better, but probably same result).

m1=0.01 kg, m2=0.5 kg.

m1*m2 = 0.01*0.5=0.005 kg².

r=0.05 m, so r²=0.0025 m².

So F=(6.674e-11) *0.005 / 0.0025.

Compute numerator: 6.674e-11 *0.005 = 3.337e-13.

Divide by denominator 0.0025: 3.337e-13 / 0.0025 = (3.337 / 2.5) )e-10.

3.337 /2.5: Let's compute that.

2.5 *1 = 2.5, 3.337 -2.5=0.837.

0.837 /2.5 = 0.3348.

So total is 1.3348.

So F≈1.3348e-10 N.

So X is approximately 1.3348, which is about 1.33 when rounded to two decimal places.

Looking at the options, option B is 1.33. So the answer should be B.

To calculate the gravitational force between the two spheres in the Cavendish balance, we use Newton's law of universal gravitation:

\[
F = G \cdot \frac{m_1 \cdot m_2}{r^2}
\]

Where:
- \( G = 6.67 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{kg}^2 \) (gravitational constant),
- \( m_1 = 0.0100 \, \text{kg} \) (mass of the small sphere),
- \( m_2 = 0.500 \, \text{kg} \) (mass of the large sphere),
- \( r = 0.0500 \, \text{m} \) (center-to-center distance between the spheres).

First, calculate the product of the masses:
\[
m_1 \cdot m_2 = 0.0100 \cdot 0.500 = 0.00500 \, \text{kg}^2
\]

Next, calculate the square of the distance:
\[
r^2 = (0.0500)^2 = 0.0025 \, \text{m}^2
\]

Now substitute these values into the formula:
\[
F = (6.67 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot \frac{0.00500}{0.0025}
\]

Simplify the numerator:
\[
6.67 \times 10^{-11} \cdot 0.00500 = 3.335 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Divide by the denominator:
\[
\frac{3.335 \times 10^{-13}}{0.0025} = 1.334 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{N}
\]

The gravitational force is therefore:
\[
F = 1.334 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{N}
\]

From the problem, the force is given as \( X \cdot 10^{-10} \, \text{N} \). Comparing, we find:
\[
X = 1.334
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, \( X = 1.33 \). Among the given options, the closest match is:

**B: 1.33**
