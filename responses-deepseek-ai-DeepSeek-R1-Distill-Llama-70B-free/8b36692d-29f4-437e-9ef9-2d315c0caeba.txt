Alright, so I've got this question about Singer's view on when it's wrong to painlessly kill an animal. Let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that Peter Singer is a well-known ethicist, especially in the area of animal rights. His book "Animal Liberation" is pretty famous. From what I recall, Singer argues that animals have interests, particularly the interest to avoid suffering. He's a utilitarian, so he's all about maximizing overall happiness and reducing pain.

The question is about painlessly killing animals. So, the key point here is that the killing is painless, meaning it doesn't cause suffering. But Singer's position isn't just about suffering; it's also about the intrinsic value of life. I think he would say that killing an animal, even painlessly, is wrong because it deprives the animal of its future experiences and life.

Wait, but wait. I'm a bit fuzzy on whether Singer makes a distinction between different animals. Like, does he consider the cognitive abilities or the capacity for self-awareness? I remember something about speciesism, which he critiques—arguing that humans shouldn't give more value to human life just because they're human. So, he might think that killing certain animals that have a higher sense of self could be more wrong than others.

But the question is about when it's wrong to kill an animal painlessly. Singer's utilitarian approach would probably consider the loss of utility, like the animal's potential future experiences. So even if the killing is painless, ending a life would be taking away all the future good experiences that animal could have had. Therefore, it's wrong unless there's a greater good achieved by it.

Looking at the options now. Option A says it's never wrong, which can't be right because Singer does think killing animals is wrong in many cases. Option B mentions only if it's a pet—doesn't seem right because Singer's arguments are more general. Option C says it's dependent on the species, which might align with considering the animal's capacity for future experiences. But I'm not sure if Singer makes it entirely about species.

Option D talks about cultural norms, but Singer is more about ethical principles than cultural relativism. Option E says it's ethically unimportant, which is the opposite of his view. Option F is about endangered species, which is too narrow. Option G says we don't need a precise answer, and H says it can't be answered. But Singer does try to give ethical guidelines, so these might not fit.

Option I says we need a precise answer, and J says case-by-case. Singer's approach is more about applying ethical principles, which might require considering each case, but I'm not sure. Wait, in his work, he does discuss specific cases like eating animals versus keeping pets, so maybe he applies a case-by-case approach based on the circumstances and the animal's interests.

Wait, no, Singer would probably say that we need to give a precise answer because ethics requires clear principles. But I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the question is about whether we can ever give a precise answer, or if it's something that varies.

Wait, I think Singer argues that it's wrong to kill animals because they have an interest in their future, but the strength of that interest might vary between species. So, perhaps he would say that it's not always wrong, but depends on the animal's capacity for future experiences. So the question is whether we need to give a precise answer about when it's wrong.

Looking back at the options, the question is whether Singer thinks we need to give a precise answer or not. From the question, the options are whether the question is one that needs a precise answer (I), or that we can't answer (H), etc.

I think Singer's approach is that we should have a clear ethical stance. So he would say that we need to give a precise answer about when it's wrong. So option I says "to which we need to give a precise answer." Alternatively, option G says we need give no precise answer. Which is it?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. I think Singer, being a utilitarian, would apply the principle of utility, which might require looking at each case. But does that mean we give a precise answer each time? Or is the answer that it's always wrong unless certain conditions are met, making it a precise rule?

Alternatively, maybe Singer's view is that the question doesn't require a precise answer because it's more about the ethical consideration in each situation. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, the question is about Singer's view on when it's wrong. From what I remember, Singer argues that killing animals is wrong because they have interests. So the question is, when is it wrong? He would probably say that it's wrong unless it's necessary for a greater good, but the specifics would vary. So perhaps he thinks we need to consider each case, making it a case-by-case basis, which would be option J.

But wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again. I think Singer does believe that we should have a clear ethical principle. For example, he's against speciesism, so the species of the animal matters in terms of their interests. But when it comes to killing, he might say it's wrong unless it's for a greater good, which would require looking at each situation. So maybe the answer is J, that it should be answered on a case-by-case basis.

Alternatively, if Singer argues that we can't give a precise answer, then it would be G. But I think he does try to give a framework, even if it's nuanced. So perhaps the correct answer is G: to which we need give no precise answer.

Wait, no, the options are: G says we need give no precise answer. H says it cannot be answered at all. I says we need to give a precise answer. So which one aligns with Singer's view.

I think Singer would say that we can't give a precise answer because the ethical decision depends on various factors, such as the animal's capacity for future experiences, the reasons for killing, etc. So each case would be different, and thus we can't have a one-size-fits-all precise rule. Therefore, the answer would be G: to which we need give no precise answer.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Another angle: Singer's main point is that animals have interests, and killing them thwarts those interests. So, in that sense, it's wrong to kill them unless it's justified, but the justification would vary. So perhaps the question is one we need to approach without expecting a precise answer, making it option G.

Alternatively, Singer might argue that we need a general principle, making it I. But I think he's more about applying the principle in specific cases rather than having a precise rule. So the answer might be G.

Wait, but going back to the options, option J says "that should be answered on a case-by-case basis." That might be more accurate because Singer would consider the specifics of each situation when deciding if killing is justified. So perhaps the answer is J.

I'm a bit torn between G and J. The question is whether Singer thinks the question is one that needs a precise answer, no precise answer, or case-by-case.

Another thought: Singer's utilitarian approach would suggest that each situation must be evaluated on its own merits because the outcomes can vary. So, the answer would be J: that should be answered on a case-by-case basis.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. I think I need to go with what I remember from his work. Singer emphasizes the importance of considering the interests of the animal and the consequences of the action. So each case would be evaluated individually, leading to option J.

The question revolves around Peter Singer's ethical stance on when it's wrong to painlessly kill an animal. Singer, a utilitarian and prominent animal rights advocate, argues that animals have interests, particularly the interest to avoid suffering and the intrinsic value of their lives. Killing an animal, even painlessly, deprives it of future experiences, making it ethically significant. Singer critiques speciesism and emphasizes that ethical decisions should consider the animal's capacity for future experiences and the broader utility of the action.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** is incorrect because Singer believes killing animals is wrong in many cases, not that it is never wrong.
- **Option B** is too narrow, as Singer's arguments are not limited to pets.
- **Option C** aligns with Singer's consideration of species, but his view is broader than just species dependency.
- **Option D** is irrelevant, as Singer focuses on ethical principles rather than cultural norms.
- **Option E** contradicts Singer's view, as he considers the question ethically important.
- **Option F** is too specific and does not capture Singer's broader ethical framework.
- **Option G** suggests no precise answer is needed, but Singer provides ethical guidelines, even if nuanced.
- **Option H** is incorrect, as Singer does attempt to answer the question.
- **Option I** implies a need for a precise answer, but Singer's utilitarian approach allows for flexibility.
- **Option J** aligns with Singer's emphasis on evaluating each situation based on its unique circumstances and the animal's interests.

Ultimately, Singer's utilitarian approach suggests that ethical decisions about killing animals should be made on a case-by-case basis, considering the specific context and consequences. Therefore, the correct answer is:

J
