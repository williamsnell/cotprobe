Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this problem about the power received by a dipole antenna. Hmm, let's see. So, the setup is two half-wavelength dipole antennas communicating in free space. The transmitter sends 1 kW of power, and the receiver is 500 km away. The frequency is 200 MHz, and the path is normal to the dipoles, meaning theta is 90 degrees. The dipoles are aligned.

Wait, I remember that the power received depends on the transmitter power, the gains of the antennas, and the distance between them. Oh right, the Friis transmission equation might be useful here. The Friis equation relates the received power to the transmitted power, considering the gains and the distance.

The Friis equation is P_r = P_t * G_t * G_r * (λ/(4πd))². So I need to find the gains of the dipole antennas and plug everything in.

I think a half-wavelength dipole antenna has a gain of about 1.64 (or maybe it's 2.14?) compared to an isotropic radiator. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Oh right, the gain of a dipole is 1.5 in terms of dBd (dB relative to a dipole), but wait, no. Wait, the gain for a half-wave dipole is 2.14 dBi, meaning 2.14 dB compared to isotropic. So the absolute gain is 1.64. Because dBi is the gain relative to an isotropic antenna, which has a gain of 1. So 2.14 dB is about 10^(2.14/10) which is around 1.64. So G_t and G_r are both 1.64 for each dipole.

Wait wait, no. Wait, the gain of a dipole is 2.14 dBi? Or is it 1.5? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Oh, wait, I think the half-wave dipole has a gain of 1.64. Let me double-check. The formula for gain is (120 * π) / (r), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I recall that the gain of a half-wave dipole is about 2.14 dB compared to an isotropic antenna, which is a gain of 1.64 in linear terms. So G = 10^(2.14/10) = approx 1.64. Yeah, that's right.

So each dipole has a gain of 1.64. So G_t = 1.64 and G_r = 1.64.

Now, the wavelength λ is the speed of light divided by the frequency. The frequency is 200 MHz, which is 2e8 Hz. So λ = c / f = 3e8 m/s / 2e8 Hz = 1.5 meters.

The distance d is 500 km, which is 5e5 meters.

Putting it all into the Friis equation:

P_r = P_t * G_t * G_r * (λ/(4πd))²

So P_t is 1e3 W (1 kW). Let's plug in the numbers.

First, let's compute λ/(4πd): 1.5 / (4 * π * 5e5) 

Wait, let me calculate that denominator first: 4 * π is about 12.566. Multiply by 5e5, that's 6.283e6. So 1.5 divided by 6.283e6 is approximately 2.387e-7.

Wait wait, 1.5 / (6.283e6) = 1.5 / 6,283,185.29 ≈ 2.387e-7.

Then, square that: (2.387e-7)^2 = approx 5.7e-14.

Then multiply by G_t * G_r: 1.64 * 1.64 = 2.6896.

So the whole equation becomes P_r = 1e3 * 2.6896 * 5.7e-14.

Let me compute 2.6896 * 5.7e-14 first. 2.6896 *5.7 is about 15.34, so 15.34e-14. So that's 1.534e-13.

Multiply by 1e3: 1.534e-10 W. So around 1.534 x 10^-10 Watts.

Looking at the options, option C is 1.53e-10, which is very close. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made an error. Oh wait, the wavelength is 1.5 meters, right? Because 200 MHz is 0.2 GHz, and wavelength in meters is 300/(frequency in MHz), so 300/200=1.5 m. That's correct.

Distance is 5e5 meters. Correct.

Gains: 1.64 each, so 1.64^2 is 2.6896. Yes.

λ/(4πd) is 1.5/(4*pi*5e5). Let me compute that step again.

4 * pi ≈ 12.566. 12.566 * 5e5 = 6.283e6 m.

So 1.5 / 6.283e6 ≈ 2.387e-7.

Squared is (2.387e-7)^2 = approx 5.7e-14.

Multiply by 2.6896 gives 5.7e-14 * 2.6896 ≈ 1.534e-13.

Multiply by 1e3 W: 1.534e-10 W. So yes, that's 1.53e-10, which is option C. So the correct answer is C.

To determine the power received by the receiver, we use the Friis transmission equation:

\[
P_r = P_t \cdot G_t \cdot G_r \cdot \left(\frac{\lambda}{4\pi d}\right)^2
\]

### Given Parameters:
- **Transmitted Power**: \( P_t = 1 \, \text{kW} = 10^3 \, \text{W} \)
- **Gain of each dipole antenna**: \( G_t = G_r = 1.64 \) (since the gain of a half-wavelength dipole is approximately 1.64 in linear terms).
- **Frequency**: \( f = 200 \, \text{MHz} = 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{Hz} \)
- **Distance between antennas**: \( d = 500 \, \text{km} = 5 \times 10^5 \, \text{m} \)

### Step 1: Calculate the wavelength \( \lambda \)
The wavelength is given by:

\[
\lambda = \frac{c}{f}
\]

where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) is the speed of light. Substituting the values:

\[
\lambda = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{2 \times 10^8} = 1.5 \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \frac{\lambda}{4\pi d} \)
Substitute \( \lambda = 1.5 \, \text{m} \) and \( d = 5 \times 10^5 \, \text{m} \):

\[
\frac{\lambda}{4\pi d} = \frac{1.5}{4\pi (5 \times 10^5)} = \frac{1.5}{6.283 \times 10^6} \approx 2.387 \times 10^{-7}
\]

### Step 3: Square the result
\[
\left(\frac{\lambda}{4\pi d}\right)^2 = (2.387 \times 10^{-7})^2 \approx 5.7 \times 10^{-14}
\]

### Step 4: Multiply by the gains
\[
G_t \cdot G_r = 1.64 \cdot 1.64 = 2.6896
\]

\[
P_r = P_t \cdot G_t \cdot G_r \cdot \left(\frac{\lambda}{4\pi d}\right)^2 = 10^3 \cdot 2.6896 \cdot 5.7 \times 10^{-14}
\]

### Step 5: Final calculation
\[
P_r = 10^3 \cdot 2.6896 \cdot 5.7 \times 10^{-14} = 1.534 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{W}
\]

### Step 6: Match with the closest option
The calculated received power is approximately \( 1.53 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{W} \), which corresponds to **Option C**.
