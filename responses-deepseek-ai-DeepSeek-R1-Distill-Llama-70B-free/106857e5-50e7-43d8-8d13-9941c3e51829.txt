Okay, so I have this question about the characteristic roots of an MA process. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The given MA process is y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t. Wait, I think an MA process is a moving average process, right? So in general, an MA(q) process is like y_t = mu + theta_1 u_{t-1} + theta_2 u_{t-2} + ... + theta_q u_{t-q}, where u_t is white noise.

But wait, the equation here has u_t, u_{t-1}, and u_{t-2}. Oh wait, does that mean it's an MA(2) process? Because it goes up to u_{t-2}, so the order is 2.

Wait, let me write the equation correctly. The given process is y_t = -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t. Wait, u_t is the current error term. So in terms of the standard MA(q) form, it's usually written as y_t = theta_0 u_t + theta_1 u_{t-1} + theta_2 u_{t-2}... So in this case, theta_0 is 1 (from u_t), theta_1 is -3, and theta_2 is 1.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because in the MA process, the coefficients are usually arranged starting from u_t. So for MA(q), it's y_t = theta_0 + theta_1 u_{t-1} + ... + theta_q u_{t-q}. But wait no, the standard form is y_t = mu + theta_1 u_{t-1} + theta_2 u_{t-2} + ... So wait, in this case, the equation is y_t = u_t -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}. So I think the coefficients are theta_1 = -3 and theta_2 = 1, and theta_0 is 1 (from u_t).

Now, I remember that the characteristic equation for an MA(q) process is obtained by considering the polynomial in the lag operator. The characteristic equation is 1 + theta_1 r + theta_2 r^2 + ... + theta_q r^q = 0. Wait, wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the MA polynomial. The MA(q) model can be written as y_t = (1 + θ_1 L + θ_2 L^2 + ... + θ_q L^q) u_t, where L is the lag operator. Then, the characteristic equation comes from setting this polynomial equal to zero. So the characteristic equation is 1 + θ_1 r + θ_2 r^2 + ... + θ_q r^q = 0.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me clarify. For an MA(q) process, the model is y_t = (θ_0 + θ_1 L + θ_2 L^2 + ... + θ_q L^q) u_t. But no, wait, θ_0 is actually the coefficient for u_t, which is θ_0=1. So the MA(q) is usually written as y_t = (1 + θ_1 L + ... + θ_q L^q) u_t. So the characteristic equation would be 1 + θ_1 r + θ_2 r^2 + ... + θ_q r^q = 0.

Wait, actually, I think I might have this backwards. Because for the AR model, the characteristic equation is based on the denominator, but for MA, it's the numerator. So perhaps I should think of the MA(q) as a polynomial in the lag operator. So for an MA(q), the equation is y_t = (1 + θ_1 L + θ_2 L^2 + ... + θ_q L^q) u_t. So the characteristic equation would be 1 + θ_1 r + θ_2 r^2 + ... + θ_q r^q = 0.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, I'm getting confused between AR and MA. Let me think again. For an AR(p) process, the characteristic equation is based on the autoregressive polynomial, which is in the denominator. So for AR(p), it's (1 - φ_1 L - ... - φ_p L^p) y_t = u_t. So the characteristic equation is 1 - φ_1 r - ... - φ_p r^p = 0.

For MA(q), the model is (1 + θ_1 L + ... + θ_q L^q) y_t = u_t. So the characteristic equation would be 1 + θ_1 r + ... + θ_q r^q = 0. So yes, that's correct.

So in this problem, the given MA process is y_t = u_t -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}. So the MA polynomial is 1 + (-3) L + 1 L^2. So the characteristic equation is 1 -3 r + r^2 = 0.

Wait, let me write that again. The MA polynomial is 1 + θ_1 L + θ_2 L^2, where θ_1 is -3 and θ_2 is 1. So the characteristic equation is 1 -3 r + (1) r^2 = 0. So r^2 -3 r +1 =0.

Wait, no, because the equation is 1 + θ_1 r + θ_2 r^2 = 0. So substituting θ_1 = -3 and θ_2 = 1, we get 1 + (-3) r + (1) r^2 = 0, which can be rewritten as r^2 -3 r +1 = 0.

So now we need to find the roots of this quadratic equation: r^2 -3r +1 = 0.

Using the quadratic formula, r = [3 ± sqrt( (3)^2 - 4 *1 *1 ) ] / (2*1) = [3 ± sqrt(9 -4)]/2 = [3 ± sqrt(5)]/2.

But wait, the options I'm given are all specific numbers, not expressions with sqrt(5). So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, let me re-read the question. Oh wait, the problem says the characteristic roots of the MA process are which of the options. So maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the model.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the given process is a mixed process, but I don't think so. The given equation is y_t = -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t. So that's equivalent to y_t = u_t -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}.

Wait, perhaps I should write the MA coefficients correctly. Let me make sure: in the standard MA(q) model, y_t = μ + θ_1 u_{t-1} + θ_2 u_{t-2} + ... + θ_q u_{t-q}. But in this case, the equation includes u_t, u_{t-1}, and u_{t-2}. So in terms of the standard form, it's y_t = (1) u_t + (-3) u_{t-1} + (1) u_{t-2}. So the MA polynomial would be 1 + (-3) L + (1) L^2.

So the characteristic equation is 1 -3 L + L^2 =0, but when we set it to zero, it's 1 -3r + r^2 =0, which is the same as r^2 -3r +1=0.

The roots of this equation would indeed be [3 ± sqrt(5)]/2. Let me compute the numerical values. sqrt(5) is about 2.236. So (3 + 2.236)/2 ≈5.236/2≈2.618, and (3-2.236)/2≈0.764/2≈0.382.

Wait, so the roots are approximately 2.618 and 0.382. Now, looking at the options:

Option B: 2 and 0.5 → 2 is close to 2.618, and 0.5 is close to 0.382? Not exactly, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I set up the equation correctly. Alternatively, maybe the question considers the process differently.

Wait another thought: perhaps it's an AR process, not MA. Because the question says "MA process", but maybe I'm confusing the two. Let me make sure.

Wait, no, the question is definitely about an MA process. So I think my approach is correct.

Wait, let me double-check the MA setup. The general form for MA(q) is y_t = theta_0 u_t + theta_1 u_{t-1} + ... + theta_q u_{t-q}. So in this case, theta_0=1, theta_1=-3, theta_2=1. So the MA polynomial is 1 + (-3) L + (1) L^2. So the characteristic equation is 1 -3 r + r^2 =0.

So the roots are [3 ± sqrt(9-4)]/2 = [3 ± sqrt(5)]/2 ≈ (3 ±2.236)/2.

So the roots are approximately 2.618 and 0.382.

Looking back at the options, none of them have these exact values. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in setting up the problem.

Wait, perhaps the MA process is written differently. Maybe the equation is written as y_t = -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t, which is same as y_t = u_t -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the MA polynomial is written as theta(L) = 1 -3 L + L^2. So the characteristic equation is theta(r) = 1 -3 r + r^2 =0.

Wait, wait, but I'm getting the same equation as before, so same roots.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the question is about the inverse characteristic equation. No, I don't think so. The characteristic roots for MA are found from the MA polynomial.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when setting up the equation. Let me think.

Wait, the MA(q) model is y_t = (1 + θ_1 L + θ_2 L^2) u_t. So the polynomial is 1 + θ_1 r + θ_2 r^2 =0. So with θ_1 = -3 and θ_2 =1, that's 1 -3 r + r^2=0.

Wait, but maybe I should write the equation as r^2 -3 r +1=0. That's correct. So the roots are [3 ± sqrt(5)]/2.

So let's compute them accurately. sqrt(5)≈2.236, so:

First root: (3 +2.236)/2 =5.236/2=2.618.

Second root: (3-2.236)/2=0.764/2=0.382.

So the roots are approximately 2.618 and 0.382.

Looking at the options again:

Option B: 2 and 0.5 → not exact, but perhaps the closest.

Option J: 2 and -0.5 → no, one is positive, the other negative.

Option F: 1 and 2 → nope.

Option E: 3 and -2 → nope.

Option H: -3 and -0.5 → both negative, no.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the MA process is written as y_t = u_t -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}, which is same as y_t = (1 -3 L + L^2) u_t.

Wait, but the characteristic equation for an MA(q) process is 1 + θ_1 r + θ_2 r^2 =0.

Wait, no, wait. I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

The MA(q) model is y_t = (1 + θ_1 L + θ_2 L^2) u_t. So the polynomial is 1 + θ_1 L + θ_2 L^2 =0 when considering the roots.

So substituting θ_1 = -3 and θ_2=1, the equation becomes 1 -3 L + L^2=0. So solving for L, we get L^2 -3 L +1=0.

Wait, but I'm solving for r, so the equation is r^2 -3 r +1=0, as before.

So the roots are (3±sqrt(5))/2, which as before are approximately 2.618 and 0.382.

Looking back at the options, none of them match exactly. So perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the order of the MA process.

Wait, the given process is y_t = -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t. Which I interpreted as an MA(2) process with coefficients theta_1 = -3 and theta_2 =1. But perhaps it's an MA(3) process? Wait, no. The highest lag is t-2, so it's MA(2).

Wait, perhaps I should think of the MA process as being written in terms of y_t and past errors. So the equation is correct as MA(2).

Alternatively, maybe I should set up the equation differently. Let me think: perhaps the MA process is written as y_t = u_t + theta_1 u_{t-1} + theta_2 u_{t-2}. So in this case, theta_1 is -3 and theta_2 is +1.

So the characteristic equation is 1 + theta_1 r + theta_2 r^2 =0 → 1 -3 r + r^2=0, same as before.

So the roots are as I calculated.

Wait, but the options given don't include these values. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to an AR process, not MA.

Wait, the question says "MA process", but maybe I should double-check. If it were an AR process, the equation would be different.

Wait, suppose it's an AR(2) process instead. Then the equation would be y_t = -3 y_{t-1} + y_{t-2} + u_t. Then the characteristic equation would be 1 +3 r + r^2 =0. Solving that, r = [-3 ±sqrt(9 -4)]/2 → [-3 ±sqrt(5)]/2. Which would be approximately (-3 +2.236)/2 ≈-0.382 and (-3-2.236)/2≈-2.618. But the options don't have negative roots in all cases.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option C is -1 and -0.5. Option D: -1 and 2. Option E:3 and -2. Option H: -3 and -0.5. Option J: 2 and -0.5.

Hmm. If it's an AR(2) process, the roots would be negative numbers, but none of the options match exactly. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, but the question definitely says it's an MA process. So I'm confident my initial approach is correct, but the options don't exactly match the roots I found. Unless I'm miscalculating something.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should write the equation as 1 -3r +r^2 =0, which factors as (r^2 -3r +1)=0. Let me see if this can be factored into integers.

Wait, the equation is r^2 -3r +1=0. The discriminant is 9-4=5, which is not a perfect square, so it doesn't factor nicely. So the roots are irrational, as I found earlier.

Looking at the options again:

A:1 and 0.5 → product 0.5, sum 1.5. Our equation sum is 3, product 1.

B:2 and 0.5 → sum 2.5, product 1.

C:-1 and -0.5 → sum -1.5, product 0.5.

D:-1 and 2 → sum 1, product -2.

E:3 and -2 → sum 1, product -6.

F:1 and 2 → sum 3, product 2.

Wait, our equation is r^2 -3r +1=0, so the sum of roots is 3, product 1.

Looking at the options:

Option F: roots 1 and 2. Sum is 3, product 2. Doesn't match because product should be 1.

Option B: 2 and 0.5. Sum 2.5, product 1. Doesn't match because sum should be 3.

Option E: 3 and -2. Sum 1, which is not 3.

Option I:1 and -2. Sum -1, no.

Option J:2 and -0.5. Sum 1.5, no.

Option D:-1 and 2. Sum 1, no.

Option H:-3 and -0.5. Sum -3.5, no.

Option G:1 and -3. Sum -2, no.

Option A:1 and 0.5. Sum 1.5, no.

Option C:-1 and -0.5. Sum -1.5, no.

Hmm. None of the options have sum 3 and product 1. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, unless I'm considering the wrong polynomial. Wait, perhaps I should have included the u_t term as part of the MA process, so maybe the order is 3?

Wait, the given equation is y_t = -3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t. So u_t is at lag 0, u_{t-1} is lag 1, u_{t-2} is lag 2. So the highest lag is 2, making it an MA(2) process. So the polynomial is 1 -3 L + L^2.

Wait another idea: perhaps the characteristic equation for an MA(q) process is written as 1 + theta_1 r + theta_2 r^2 + ... =0, but perhaps I should consider it as 1 + theta_1 (1/r) + theta_2 (1/r)^2 + ... =0, and then find
