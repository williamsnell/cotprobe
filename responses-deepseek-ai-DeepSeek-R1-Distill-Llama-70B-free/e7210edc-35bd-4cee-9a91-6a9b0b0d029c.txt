Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about where different items belong on a balance sheet. I'm a bit rusty on accounting, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question lists five items: Taxes payable, Capital stock, Retained earnings, Administrative expense, and Prepaid expenses. I need to figure out which section of the balance sheet each one falls into. The options given are A through J, each assigning the items to different sections.

First, I remember that a balance sheet has three main sections: Assets, Liabilities, and Owner's Equity. The Income Statement is a different financial statement, so any item that's an income or expense would go there, not on the balance sheet.

Let's break down each item one by one.

A) Taxes payable. I think taxes that a company owes but hasn't paid yet are a liability. So that should be in the Liabilities section.

B) Capital stock. This is the amount invested by owners, right? So it's part of the Owner's Equity. It's like the money the company gets when it issues shares.

C) Retained earnings. These are profits reinvested in the company, so definitely part of Owner's Equity. It's not an asset or liability because it's the company's own funds.

D) Administrative expense. Hmm, administrative expenses are costs incurred, so they're an expense. Expenses go on the Income Statement, not the balance sheet. So this one doesn't belong on the balance sheet at all.

E) Prepaid expenses. These are payments made in advance for things like rent or insurance. Since the company has paid but not yet used the service, it's an asset. So Prepaid expenses should be on the Asset side.

Wait, let me recap:

A) Liability
B) Owner's Equity
C) Owner's Equity
D) Income Statement
E) Asset

Looking at the options, I need to see which one matches this.

The options are from A to J, each assigning sections to the items (A) to (E).

Looking for an option where:

A is Liability → So any option where (A) is in Liability.

B is Owner's Equity.

C is Owner's Equity.

D is Income Statement.

E is Asset.

So let me check the options.

Option J: (A) Liability, (B) Owner's Equity, (C) Owner's Equity, (D) Income Statement, (E) Asset. That seems to match what I thought.

Wait, let me check each option.

Option J says:

A: Liability
B: Owner's Equity
C: Owner's Equity
D: Income Statement
E: Asset

Yes, that's exactly what I have. So the correct answer should be J.

I think that's right. Let me make sure I didn't mix anything up.

Taxes payable as liability makes sense because it's something the company owes.

Capital stock is part of equity, as it's the owners' investment.

Retained earnings are also equity, as they are profits kept in the company.

Administrative expense is an expense, so it's on the Income Statement, not the balance sheet.

Prepaid expenses are assets because they're payments made for future benefits, so they're assets until used.

So yeah, option J should be the correct one.

To determine where each item belongs on the balance sheet, we analyze each one based on its nature:

1. **Taxes payable**: This represents amounts owed by the company for taxes, making it a liability. Therefore, it belongs in the **Liability section**.  
2. **Capital stock**: This is the amount invested by owners in the company, which is part of the owners' equity. Thus, it belongs in the **Owner's Equity section**.  
3. **Retained earnings**: These are profits reinvested in the company, also part of owners' equity. Hence, it belongs in the **Owner's Equity section**.  
4. **Administrative expense**: This is a cost incurred by the company, which is recorded as an expense on the **Income Statement**, not on the balance sheet.  
5. **Prepaid expenses**: These are payments made in advance for goods or services, making them an asset until the benefit is realized. Therefore, they belong on the **Asset side** of the balance sheet.  

Matching these classifications to the options provided, **Option J** correctly assigns each item to its respective section:  
- (A) Taxes payable → Liability section  
- (B) Capital stock → Owner's Equity section  
- (C) Retained earnings → Owner's Equity section  
- (D) Administrative expense → Income Statement  
- (E) Prepaid expenses → Asset side  

Thus, the correct answer is **J**.
