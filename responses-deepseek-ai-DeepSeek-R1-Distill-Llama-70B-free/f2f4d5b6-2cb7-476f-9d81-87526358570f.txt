Okay, so I've got this logic problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about symbolizing a given sentence into a logical formula, and then choosing the correct option from the provided choices.

The sentence is: "Either England's importing beef is not a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture, or China promotes human rights if South Africa supplies diamonds."

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I need to understand what each part means in terms of logical connectives.

The sentence has two main parts connected by 'or', which in logic is the disjunction operator ∨. So the structure is (Part A) ∨ (Part B).

Let's look at Part A: "England's importing beef is not a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture." 

Wait, necessary condition... I remember that in logic, a necessary condition is something that must be true for another statement to be true. So if A is a necessary condition for B, then B → A. So if England importing beef (let's call this E) is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture (let's call this F), then F → E. 

But the statement says it's *not* a necessary condition. So the negation of (F → E) would be ~ (F → E). Another way to write F → E is ~F ∨ E, so the negation would be F ∧ ~E. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach here. 

Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. The statement says that E is not a necessary condition for F. So if E were a necessary condition, then F would imply E. So E is necessary for F is F → E. So saying E is not necessary for F would be the negation of that, which is ~ (F → E). Alternatively, that's equivalent to F ∧ ~E, but perhaps it's better to keep it as ~ (F → E) for now.

Alternatively, another approach: The original statement says "England's importing beef is not a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture." So in other words, France can subsidize agriculture without England importing beef. So that means that France's action (F) does not require England's action (E). So F can happen without E. Which would mean that it's not the case that F → E. So the first part is ~ (F → E).

Now, moving on to Part B: "China promotes human rights if South Africa supplies diamonds."

This is a conditional statement. "If South Africa supplies diamonds (let's call this S), then China promotes human rights (let's call this C)." So this translates to S → C.

Putting it all together, the entire sentence is:

Either [~ (F → E)] or [S → C]

So in logical terms, that's ~ (F → E) ∨ (S → C).

Now, let's look at the options provided to see which one matches this structure.

Let's recall that F → E is equivalent to ~F ∨ E. So ~ (F → E) is the same as ~ (~F ∨ E), which by De Morgan's laws is F ∧ ~E. But perhaps the options will express this in another form.

Wait, but looking at the options, some of them have implications. Let me check each option:

Option A: (E ⊃ ~F) ∨ (S ≡ C)
- E implies not F, which doesn't seem right. Also, S ≡ C is a biconditional, which isn't what we have.

Option B: ~(F ⊃ E) ∨ (S ⊃ C)
- This looks promising. The first part is ~(F → E), which matches our Part A. The second part is S → C, matching Part B. So this seems correct.

Option C: ~(F ⊃ E) ∨ (C ⊃ ~S)
- The second part here is C → ~S, which is different from S → C. So no.

Option D: (~E ⊃ F) ∨ (S ⊃ C)
- The first part is ~E → F, which is equivalent to E ∨ F, which isn't what we have. Our first part is ~ (F → E), not involving ~E.

Option E: (~F ⊃ E) ∨ (C ≡ ~S)
- The first part is F → E, which is the opposite of what we want. Because Part A is ~ (F → E). So this can't be right.

Option F: (~F ⊃ E) ∨ (C ≡ S)
- Again, the first part is F → E, which is the opposite of our Part A.

Option G: (F ⊃ E) ∨ (~C ⊃ S)
- The first part is F → E, which again is the opposite of our Part A. The second part is ~C → S, which is different from S → C.

Option H: ~(F ⊃ ~E) ∨ (S ⊃ C)
- The first part is ~(F → ~E), which would be F ∧ E, which is different from our Part A, which was ~ (F → E). So this doesn't match.

Option I: (~E ⊃ F) ∨ (C ⊃ S)
- The first part is ~E → F, which is E ∨ F, not matching Part A. The second part is C → S, which is the converse of S → C, so not correct.

Option J: (E ⊃ F) ∨ (C ⊃ S)
- The first part is E → F, which isn't what we have. The second part is C → S, again the converse, so incorrect.

So, the correct option is B: ~(F ⊃ E) ∨ (S ⊃ C).

The sentence to symbolize is: "Either England's importing beef is not a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture, or China promotes human rights if South Africa supplies diamonds."

### Breakdown of the Sentence:
1. **Part A**: "England's importing beef is not a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture."  
   - If E (England importing beef) were a necessary condition for F (France subsidizing agriculture), it would mean \( F \rightarrow E \).  
   - The negation of this is \( \neg (F \rightarrow E) \).

2. **Part B**: "China promotes human rights if South Africa supplies diamonds."  
   - This is a conditional statement: "If S (South Africa supplies diamonds), then C (China promotes human rights)," which translates to \( S \rightarrow C \).

### Logical Structure:
The entire sentence is a disjunction of the two parts:  
\[
\neg (F \rightarrow E) \lor (S \rightarrow C)
\]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: \( (E \rightarrow \neg F) \lor (S \equiv C) \)  
  - Incorrect. \( E \rightarrow \neg F \) does not match \( \neg (F \rightarrow E) \), and \( S \equiv C \) is a biconditional, not a conditional.

- **Option B**: \( \neg (F \rightarrow E) \lor (S \rightarrow C) \)  
  - Correct. This matches the logical structure derived above.

- **Option C**: \( \neg (F \rightarrow E) \lor (C \rightarrow \neg S) \)  
  - Incorrect. The second part \( C \rightarrow \neg S \) does not match \( S \rightarrow C \).

- **Option D**: \( (\neg E \rightarrow F) \lor (S \rightarrow C) \)  
  - Incorrect. The first part \( \neg E \rightarrow F \) does not match \( \neg (F \rightarrow E) \).

- **Option E**: \( (\neg F \rightarrow E) \lor (C \equiv \neg S) \)  
  - Incorrect. The first part \( \neg F \rightarrow E \) is the converse of \( F \rightarrow E \), and the second part \( C \equiv \neg S \) is a biconditional.

- **Option F**: \( (\neg F \rightarrow E) \lor (C \equiv S) \)  
  - Incorrect. The first part \( \neg F \rightarrow E \) is the converse of \( F \rightarrow E \), and the second part \( C \equiv S \) is a biconditional.

- **Option G**: \( (F \rightarrow E) \lor (\neg C \rightarrow S) \)  
  - Incorrect. The first part \( F \rightarrow E \) is the opposite of \( \neg (F \rightarrow E) \), and the second part \( \neg C \rightarrow S \) is not equivalent to \( S \rightarrow C \).

- **Option H**: \( \neg (F \rightarrow \neg E) \lor (S \rightarrow C) \)  
  - Incorrect. The first part \( \neg (F \rightarrow \neg E) \) is equivalent to \( F \land E \), which does not match \( \neg (F \rightarrow E) \).

- **Option I**: \( (\neg E \rightarrow F) \lor (C \rightarrow S) \)  
  - Incorrect. The first part \( \neg E \rightarrow F \) does not match \( \neg (F \rightarrow E) \), and the second part \( C \rightarrow S \) is the converse of \( S \rightarrow C \).

- **Option J**: \( (E \rightarrow F) \lor (C \rightarrow S) \)  
  - Incorrect. The first part \( E \rightarrow F \) does not match \( \neg (F \rightarrow E) \), and the second part \( C \rightarrow S \) is the converse of \( S \rightarrow C \).

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it accurately symbolizes the given sentence. 

Answer: B
