Question:

A city entered into a small-cost construction contract with a construction company whereby the latter obligated themselves to perform certain minor sewer repair work. Two months after completion of the work, the company sued the city for its failure to pay under the terms of the contract. At trial, the company's construction supervisor who personally oversaw all the repair work was called to testify. He sought to testify about the amount of sewer pipe used, the number of hours required to complete the job, and the number of workers employed by the company during the construction repair work. The defendant's attorney objected on the grounds that the company routinely recorded such factual information in their log books, which were in the company's possession. As a consequence, the supervisor's testimony should be ruled

Options:

A: inadmissible, because such testimony would be violative of the best evidence rule.
B: inadmissible, because no evidence was introduced to show that the original log records are not available for examination.
C: admissible, because it is relevant to the case.
D: admissible, because the supervisor is a credible witness.
E: admissible, because it is based on firsthand knowledge.
F: inadmissible, because it would be hearsay evidence.
G: inadmissible, because the information is not relevant to the case.
H: admissible, because the supervisor was directly involved in the construction work.
I: admissible, because it is a report of regularly conducted business activities.
J: inadmissible, because the supervisor was not under oath when the information was recorded.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence question. Let's see what it's about. The scenario is about a construction company suing a city for non-payment after completing some sewer repair work. The company's supervisor is testifying about certain details like the amount of sewer pipe used, hours required, and number of workers. The defense objects, saying the company has log books with that info. They argue that the supervisor's testimony should be inadmissible because of the best evidence rule.

Hmm, the best evidence rule is in the Federal Rules of Evidence, right? I remember it's Rule 1002, which says that to prove the content of a writing, recording, or photograph, you need to produce the original unless certain exceptions apply. So, if the information is recorded in the log books, the original log books should be produced, not just someone testifying about what's in them.

Wait, but there are exceptions to the best evidence rule. Like, if the original is lost or destroyed, or if it's not obtainable, or if the opposing party has it. But here, the log books are in the company's possession, so they're available. So the supervisor's testimony about those specific details would be inadmissible under the best evidence rule because the log books should be presented instead.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's inadmissible because of the best evidence rule. That seems to fit because the original logs exist and are available, so the testimony shouldn't replace them.

Option B says it's inadmissible because no evidence was introduced about the logs' availability. Wait, but the defendant's attorney objected on the grounds that the company has the logs. So the point is that the logs are available, making B a possible option. But I think the key is whether the original is necessary. The best evidence rule would require the original unless an exception applies.

Option C says admissible because it's relevant. But relevance isn't the issue here; it's about the form of evidence. So C is probably incorrect.

Option D talks about credibility, which isn't the issue either. The objection is about the best evidence rule, not whether the supervisor is credible.

Option E says it's admissible because it's firsthand knowledge. But even if the supervisor knows it firsthand, if the info is recorded and available, the best evidence rule applies. So E might be incorrect.

Option F is about hearsay. The supervisor's testimony is not hearsay because he's testifying about facts he personally knew, so F is probably wrong.

Option G says inadmissible because not relevant. No, the info is relevant to the case about payment, so G is out.

Option H says admissible because he was involved. Again, the issue is the form, not his involvement, so H is incorrect.

Option I is about business records. If the logs are business records under FRE 803(6), they would be admissible as an exception to hearsay. But the supervisor is testifying, not the logs. So the best evidence rule applies, making I not the right reason.

Option J is about the supervisor not being under oath when recording. That doesn't matter because the logs would be admissible as business records regardless, but the issue is about the best evidence rule, not the oath.

So, putting it together, the correct answer should be A: inadmissible because it violates the best evidence rule. Because the logs exist and are available, the testimony can't replace the original documents.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a construction supervisor's testimony regarding specific details about a construction project when the information is recorded in the company's log books. The defense objected, citing the best evidence rule, which requires the original document to be produced if available to prove the content of writing or recordings.

Under Federal Rule of Evidence 1002, the best evidence rule mandates that the original document must be presented unless an exception applies. Here, the log books are in the company's possession and are available, so the supervisor's testimony about the contents of the logs would be inadmissible. The best evidence rule takes precedence because the original logs should be produced instead of relying on testimony.

Analyzing the options:

- **A** is correct because the testimony violates the best evidence rule since the original logs are available.
- **B** is incorrect because the objection already established that the logs are available, making this reasoning unnecessary.
- **C, D, E, H** are incorrect because they focus on relevance, credibility, or involvement, which are not the core issues here.
- **F, G, J** are incorrect because they address hearsay, relevance, or oath-taking, which are not the primary concerns.
- **I** is incorrect because the testimony itself, not the log books, is the issue.

Thus, the supervisor's testimony is inadmissible under the best evidence rule.

**Answer: A**
