Question:

A manufacturer of electric motors formerly produced motors that utilized as a coolant a chemical substancethat was later discovered to be highly toxic. During its manufacturing operations, the manufacturer negligentlyallowed quantities of this substance to leak into the soil. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) orderedthat the premises, now owned by an appliance repair shop, be decontaminated. This order, and the subsequent cleanup efforts, received a high level of attention in the local media. An employee of the appliance repair shop has sued the manufacturer in negligence for damages for emotionaldistress. The employee claims to have suffered the distress as a consequence of learning that she has beenexposed for five years, while employed by the appliance repair shop at the premises affected by the EPA order,to the toxic contamination that has existed there. Her complaint does not allege that her emotional distress issevere, that the manufacturer's conduct was extreme and outrageous, or that she has suffered any physicalconsequences. In that action the manufacturer has filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief maybe granted. What is the manufacturer's best argument in support of that motion?

Options:

A: The manufacturer cannot be held liable for negligence because the toxic substance was not known to be harmful at the time of the leakage.
B: The manufacturer cannot be held liable because the EPA is responsible for the decontamination process.
C: The employee cannot sue the manufacturer because she was not exposed to the toxic substance directly from the manufacturer.
D: The repair shop employee's emotional distress is not alleged to be severe.
E: The complaint does not allege that the manufacturer was aware of the toxicity of the substance at the time of the leakage.
F: The complaint does not allege that the manufacturer's conduct was extreme and outrageous.
G: The complaint does not allege that the employee suffered any financial loss due to the emotional distress.
H: The complaint does not allege that the repair shop employee suffered any physical consequences.
I: The repair shop employee's proper remedy is in a claim against the repair shop, the occupier of thepremises during the period of her alleged exposure.
J: The employee cannot sue the manufacturer because she was not employed by the manufacturer at the time of the exposure.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about tort law, specifically negligence and emotional distress. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is about a manufacturer who used a toxic coolant that later leaked into the soil. The EPA ordered the current owner, an appliance repair shop, to decontaminate the premises. An employee of the repair shop is suing the manufacturer for emotional distress because she was exposed to the contamination for five years. She's claiming negligence. The manufacturer is moving to dismiss the case for failure to state a claim.

The question is asking what the manufacturer's best argument is in support of that motion. The options are from A to J.

So, I need to figure out what elements of a negligence claim are missing here. A negligence claim requires duty, breach, causation, and damages. But when it comes to emotional distress, there are specific rules.

In many jurisdictions, to claim emotional distress caused by negligence, the plaintiff must show that the distress is severe. Some courts require that the distress arises from a direct threat of physical harm or that there's some physical impact. Without physical harm, it's harder to claim emotional distress damages.

Looking at the complaint, the employee doesn't allege that her emotional distress is severe. She also doesn't claim any physical consequences. So, under the law, without severe distress or physical harm, her claim might not hold.

Now, looking at the options:

Option D says the emotional distress isn't alleged to be severe. Option H says no physical consequences. Option F talks about extreme and outrageous conduct, which is more relevant to intentional infliction of emotional distress, not negligence.

So the manufacturer's best argument would be that the employee didn't allege severe emotional distress. Without that, the claim for negligence leading to emotional distress doesn't stand.

Wait, but in some cases, like when there's a fear of future harm, such as exposure to toxic substances leading to a fear of cancer, courts might allow emotional distress claims. But I think in this case, since she's suing for emotional distress from learning about the exposure, but not alleging it's severe or any physical harm, the claim is weak.

So the best argument is D: The employee's emotional distress is not alleged to be severe.

The manufacturer's best argument is that the employee's emotional distress is not alleged to be severe, which is a required element for a negligence claim involving emotional distress without physical harm.

D
