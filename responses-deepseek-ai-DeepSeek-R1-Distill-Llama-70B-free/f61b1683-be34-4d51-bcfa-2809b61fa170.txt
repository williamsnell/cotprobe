Question:

A very crude model of the buckminsterfullerene molecule $\left(\mathrm{C}_{60}\right)$ is to treat it as a collection of electrons in a cube with sides of length equal to the mean diameter of the molecule $(0.7 \mathrm{~nm})$.

Okay, so I need to solve this problem about the buckminsterfullerene molecule, C60. Hmm, the question is about predicting the wavelength of the first excitation using a crude model. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the model treats the electrons as being in a cube with sides of length 0.7 nm. So the cube has edges of 0.7 nm each. I remember that in a 3D box, the energy levels of electrons depend on their quantum numbers in each direction. The formula for the energy levels in a 3D box is E = (h²/(8mL²))(n_x² + n_y² + n_z²), where h is Planck's constant, m is the mass of the electron, and L is the length of the cube's side.

Wait, but wait. The problem mentions pi electrons. Carbon has four valence electrons normally, but in graphite or graphene, each carbon is bonded with three others, so one electron is in the pi orbital. So each carbon contributes one pi electron. Since there are 60 carbons in C60, there are 60 pi electrons. But wait, electrons are fermions, so they'll fill the available energy states with two electrons each (due to spin up and down).

So the number of electrons is 60. So 60 electrons mean 30 filled states because each state can hold two electrons. So I need to find the lowest energy transition, which is the first excitation. The first excitation would be when an electron moves from the highest occupied energy level to the next available unoccupied one.

So I need to figure out the quantum numbers for the highest occupied state. Let me think, in a cube, the energy levels are determined by the quantum numbers n_x, n_y, n_z. The lowest energy is when all are 1, then combinations increase.

But wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the order of energy levels. The energy is proportional to n_x² + n_y² + n_z². So the first few states are:

1: (1,1,1) → energy E111.

Then, the next set would be all the permutations where the sum is the next possible. So the next lowest is (2,1,1), which would have the same energy for all permutations, like (1,2,1) and (1,1,2).

Wait, but calculating the exact order might take time. Alternatively, for a cube with 0.7 nm sides, perhaps the electrons are in a certain shell, and the first excitation is from that shell to the next.

Wait, another approach: the energy levels are quantized, so each state is determined by the quantum numbers. The ground state is when all electrons are filled up to a certain n. But with 30 filled states, I need to find what the highest occupied quantum numbers are.

Wait, each state is specified by (n_x, n_y, n_z). The number of possible states increases with higher quantum numbers. So for n=1 in all directions, it's just (1,1,1) → 1 state, holds 2 electrons. Then n=2 in one direction and 1 in others. For (2,1,1), the number of distinct states is 3 because the 2 can be in any of the three axes. Each of these 3 states holds 2 electrons each, so 6 electrons.

Wait, but wait. Let me list the possible states in order of increasing energy.

E = (n_x² + n_y² + n_z²). Let's compute E for various combinations.

The lowest is (1,1,1) → 3 → E=3.

Next is (2,1,1) → sum is 6 → E=6. But there are multiple states with this sum because the 2 can be in any of the three positions. So there are 3 distinct states here.

Then (2,2,1) → sum is 4+4+1=9 → E=9. The number of such states is 3 choose 1, but wait, it's the permutations where two are 2 and one is 1. So that's 3 possibilities.

Wait, no, more accurately, the count is the number of distinct permutations. For (n_x, n_y, n_z), how many unique orderings are there for a given set of numbers. For example, for (2,1,1), n_x, n_y, n_z can be arranged in 3 ways. Similarly, for (2,2,1), there are 3 ways.

So let me make a list of energies and number of states:

E=3 → 1 state → 2 electrons.

E=6 → 3 states → 6 electrons.

E=9 → 3 states → 6 electrons.

Wait, what comes after E=9? Next would be (3,1,1), which sums to 11 → E=11?

Wait, no, wait, 3^2 is 9, so (3,1,1) → 9 +1 +1 = 11.

But wait, perhaps (2,2,2) would have E= (4+4+4)=12. So E=12.

So the order is E=3, 6, 9, 11, 12, etc.

Wait, but wait, what is the order of E=7,8, etc.? Let me think: Are there states with E=4,5, etc.?

Wait, no, because (n_x, n_y, n_z) are positive integers starting from 1. So the next possible sum after 3 is 6, then 9, 11, 12, etc.

Wait, no, wait: (2,1,1) sum is 6, and (1,2,1) is same sum, etc. Then the next is (2,2,1) sum 9. Then (3,1,1) sum 11, and (2,2,2) sum 12.

So the energy levels in order are:

E=3 (1 state),

E=6 (3 states),

E=9 (3 states),

E=11 (3 states),

E=12 (1 state),

E=14 (for (3,2,1) → 9+4+1=14, with 6 states because 3! permutations where each of 3,2,1 is in any position; but wait, 3,2,1 are all distinct, so 3! =6 permutations. So E=14 would have 6 states.

Wait, but how do the electrons fill up these states? Each state can hold 2 electrons.

So starting from E=3:

- E=3: 1 state → 2 electrons.

- E=6: 3 states → each holds 2, so 6 electrons. So up to here, 8 electrons.

- E=9: 3 states → 6 electrons. Now total 14.

- E=11: 3 states → 6 electrons. Now 20.

- E=12: 1 state → 2 electrons. Total 22.

- E=14: 6 states → 12 electrons. Filling these would take us to 34. But wait, we have 60 electrons to place.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's think about the filling order again.

Wait, perhaps the order of energy levels is:

E=3 → 1 state,

E=6 → 3 states,

E=9 → 3 states,

E=11 → 3 states,

E=12 → 1 state,

E=14 → 6 states,

E=15 → ... Hmm, perhaps I should think of all possible (n_x, n_y, n_z) and their sums.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to calculate the number of electrons filled up to each energy level until we reach 60.

Wait, let's calculate the cumulative number of electrons.

Start with E=3: 1 state → 2e → total 2.

E=6: 3 states → 6e → total 8.

E=9: 3 states → 6e → total 14.

E=11: 3 states → 6e → total 20.

E=12: 1 state → 2e → total 22.

E=14: 6 states → 12e → total 34.

E=15: let's see, which states have E=15? Let's compute possible (n_x, n_y, n_z) such that the sum is 15.

Wait, 15 = 9 +4 + 2? So (3,2,2) → 3² + 2² + 2² = 9+4+4=17 → no.

Wait, 15 can be 16 +1 + something? No, because 16 is 4², but 4² is 16, which would make sum 16 + ... which would be more than 15.

Wait, perhaps E=15 comes from (3,2,2), but that's sum 17. Hmm, maybe another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should list all possible combinations systematically.

Wait, another approach is to realize that each energy level E is given by (n_x² + n_y² + n_z²). The possible values can be found in order.

But maybe it's getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps each energy level can be thought of in terms of a "shell" similar to atoms, but in a cubic box. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excitation is the transition between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). So I need to find the energy difference between the HOMO and LUMO.

But to find that, I need to know the quantum numbers for the last filled state (HOMO) and the first unfilled (LUMO). So how many electrons have been filled before the HOMO?

Wait, 60 electrons, and each state holds 2 electrons. So number of filled states is 60 / 2 = 30.

So the 30th state is the HOMO. I need to find which (n_x, n_y, n_z) corresponds to the 30th state when the states are ordered by their energy.

So let's list the states in order of increasing E and count the number of states until we reach 30.

E=3: 1 state → cumulative 1.

E=6: 3 → cumulative 4.

E=9: 3 → cumulative 7.

E=11: 3 → cumulative 10.

E=12: 1 → cumulative 11.

E=14: 6 → cumulative 17.

E=18: let's see, what states have E=18. Let's compute:

18 = n_x² + n_y² + n_z².

Possible combinations: 16 + 1 + 1 → (4,1,1). So E=18. How many states? 3 (since the 4 can be in any of the three positions).

So E=18: 3 states → cumulative 20.

E=19: Let's see, 19= 9+9+1 → (3,3,1). So sum is 9+9+1=19. Number of states: 3 (since the 1 can be in any position).

So E=19: 3 → cumulative 23.

E=21: Let's see, 21= 16+4+1 → (4,2,1). Sum is 16+4+1=21.

The number of states for (4,2,1) is 6, since all three numbers are distinct. So it's 3! =6 permutations.

So E=21: 6 states → cumulative 29.

Wait, 23 + 6 = 29. So next, the 30th state is the first state of the next energy level.

Wait, what's the next energy after E=21? Let's calculate E=22.

Hmm, E=22: let's find possible combinations.

22= 16 + 4 + 2 → 4² + 2² + (sqrt(2))² → no, because we need integers. Alternatively, 9 + 9 +4 =22 → 3² +3² +2²=9+9+4=22. So (3,3,2).

So number of states for (3,3,2) is 3 (since the 2 can be in any position). So E=22 has 3 states.

So cumulative after E=21 is 29, so the 30th state is the first state of E=22.

So the HOMO is at E=22, and the LUMO would be the next available state, which is also in E=22. Wait no, because the first state of E=22 is filled as the 30th state. So the next state would be the next one in E=22, but since the HOMO is the highest filled, the LUMO is the next available state beyond that.

Wait, but wait, the number of states at E=22 is 3. So each state holds 2 electrons. So the first state (n=30) is filled, the second state (n=31 and 32) would be filled, and the third (n=33 and 34) would be filled. But wait, we have 60 electrons → 30 filled states (each holds 2). So when we reach 30 filled states, the HOMO is the 30th state, which is the third state in E=22, but wait, no, let me double-check.

Wait, the cumulative up to E=21 is 29 (each state in E=21 is 6 states → 6*2=12 electrons, but wait no, each state can hold 2 electrons. So the number of electrons filled is 2 per state.)

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the count. Let me make a table:

E | Number of states | Electrons (per state * 2) | Cumulative Electrons
--- | --- | --- | ---
3 | 1 | 2 | 2
6 | 3 | 6 → total 8
9 | 3 → 6 → 14
11 | 3 → 6 → 20
12 |1 →2 →22
14 |6 →12 →34
18|3→6→40
19|3→6→46
21|6→12→58
22|3→6→64

Wait, but 60 electrons are needed. So E=21 has 6 states, each holding 2 electrons → 12 e. So cumulative up to E=21 is 58. So the 58th electron is filled at E=21. Then, the next set is E=22, which has 3 states. Each can take 2 electrons.

So 58 + 2 = 60. So the 60th electron is in the first state of E=22. So the HOMO is at E=22, and the LUMO is the next state in E=22. Wait, but E=22 has 3 states, each can hold 2 electrons. So after 60 electrons, the first state of E=22 is filled with 2 electrons, and the other two states are empty. So the LUMO would be the next available state, which is also in E=22, but perhaps the same energy level. Wait, but the transition would be from the HOMO (E=22) to the LUMO (E=22), but that doesn't make sense because same energy. So perhaps I made a mistake in the ordering.

Alternatively, perhaps the next energy level after E=22 is E= ... Let's think. What E comes after 22?

E=23: possible combinations? Let's see, 23= 16+4+3? Wait, 16+4+3=23, but the squares are 16 (4^2), 4 (2^2), and 9 (3^2) → 16 +4 +9=29, which is higher than 23. Hmm, perhaps E=23 arises from (3,3,1): 9+9+1=19, which is E=19. So maybe the next after E=22 is E=24. Let's see: 24= 16 + 4 +4 → (4,2,2) → 16+4+4=24. So E=24.

Number of states for (4,2,2) would be 3, since the 4 can be in any of the three positions.

So the LUMO is the first available state after the HOMO. So if the HOMO is at E=22, the LUMO would be the next higher energy level, which is E=24.

So the energy difference would be E_LUMO - E_HOMO = 24 -22 = 2 (in units where h²/(8mL²) is factored out).

Wait, but the actual energy levels are E = (h²/(8mL²))(n_x² + n_y² + n_z²).

So the difference between E_LUMO and E_HOMO is:

ΔE = E_LUMO - E_HOMO = (h²/(8mL²))(24 -22) = (h²/(8mL²))(2).

Wait, no, because HOMO is at E=22, and LUMO is at E=24. So 24-22=2.

So ΔE = (h²/(8mL²)) * 2.

But wait, let me recheck. HOMO is at E=22, which is (n_x² +n_y² +n_z²) =22.

Wait, no, E=22 comes from (3,3,2): 9+9+4=22.

So the HOMO is at E=22, and the LUMO is at E=24 (from 4,2,2 → 16+4+4=24).

So the energy difference is 24-22=2 in terms of (n² units).

So ΔE = (h²/(8mL²)) * 2.

Now, I need to compute this ΔE and then find the corresponding photon wavelength.

The formula relating energy and wavelength is E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light.

So rearranging, λ = hc/ΔE.

So I can plug in the values.

Let me list the constants:

h = 6.626 × 10^-34 J·s

m (electron mass) = 9.109 × 10^-31 kg

L = 0.7 nm = 0.7 × 10^-9 m

c = 3.0 × 10^8 m/s

But wait, the energy ΔE is (h²/(8m
