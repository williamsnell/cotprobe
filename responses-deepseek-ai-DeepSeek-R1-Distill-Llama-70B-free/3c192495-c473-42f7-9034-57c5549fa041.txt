Okay, so I've got this problem about A1 and Bob investing money in a business, and I need to figure out how the profits are split between them. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll read the question again to make sure I understand it. A1 invested $70,000, and Bob invested $90,000. The profits and losses are shared in a specific way: each partner gets 8% interest on their investment, and then they split the remaining balance equally. The business made a $10,000 profit, and I need to find out each partner's share.

Hmm, so each gets 8% interest on their own investment first. Then the remaining profit is split equally. Wait, does that mean that after taking out the 8% for each, the rest is divided 50-50? Or is the remaining balance after both 8%s are taken out, and then that's split equally between them?

Let me think. The total profit is $10,000. So first, calculate 8% for each partner based on their investment.

For A1: 8% of $70,000 is 0.08 * 70,000. Let me compute that. 70,000 * 0.08 is $5,600.

For Bob: 8% of $90,000 is 0.08 * 90,000. That's 7,200. So Bob gets $7,200 from the interest.

Wait, but the total profit is $10,000. If I add A1's interest ($5,600) and Bob's ($7,200), that's $12,800. Oh wait, that's more than the total profit. That can't be right because the profit is only $10,000. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the profit sharing.

Wait, maybe the 8% is on their investment, but the total 8% can't exceed the profit. Or perhaps the way it's structured is that each partner gets 8%, but that comes out of the profit. Hmm.

Wait, let me read the question again. It says, "each partner receives 8% interest on his investment and 1/2 of the balance." So the 8% is on their own investment, and then the remaining balance is split equally.

Wait, perhaps the structure is: each gets 8% on their investment, and then the remaining profit after these interests is split equally between them. But wait, the problem says "the profits and losses are shared, so that each partner receives 8% interest on his investment and 1/2 of the balance."

Hmm, maybe the way it's worded is that each partner's share is two parts: 8% of their investment, plus half of the remaining balance. So the total profit is $10,000.

So first, each gets their 8%:

A1's 8%: 70,000 * 0.08 = $5,600.

Bob's 8%: 90,000 * 0.08 = $7,200.

Wait, but again, adding these gives $12,800, which is more than the total profit of $10k. So that can't be right. So perhaps that's not the correct approach.

Wait, maybe the "balance" refers to the profit after taking out the 8% for each. Wait, but that would mean subtracting the 8% from the profit. Or maybe the profit is allocated first as 8% of each investment, but I'm getting confused.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the 8% is a guaranteed return, and any profit beyond that is split equally. So the total profit is $10,000. First, allocate 8% to each partner based on their investment. But wait, that's again $5,600 to A1 and $7,200 to Bob, totaling $12,800, which is more than $10k. So that can't work.

Wait, perhaps the 8% is applied to the profit. No, that can't be because the 8% is on their investment. Alternatively, maybe the profit is allocated as 8% on each investment, but only up to the amount of profit available.

Wait, maybe the way to look at it is that each partner is entitled to 8% per annum on their capital, and any remaining profit is split equally. So the 8% is calculated on each partner's capital, and if the total profit is enough to cover both, then each gets their 8%, and the remaining is split. But if the profit is less than the sum of both 8%s, then they might not get their full 8%, but in this case, the profit is $10k, which is less than $12.8k. So perhaps they don't get the full 8% each.

Wait, but the question states that the business earned a $10,000 profit. So perhaps the 8% is applied only if there's profit. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the profit is allocated as follows: each partner gets 8% on their investment, and then the remaining profit is split equally. So the total 8% for both is $5,600 + $7,200 = $12,800, but the total profit is only $10,000. So that doesn't make sense because you can't take more than the profit. So perhaps the 8% is not a guaranteed minimum but rather the way the profit is split.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps each partner's share is 8% of their investment plus half of the remaining profit. Let me try that.

So total profit is $10,000.

First, calculate 8% of A1's investment: $5,600.

Calculate 8% of Bob's investment: $7,200.

But wait, that's $12,800, which is more than $10,000. So that can't be. So perhaps the 8% is applied differently.

Wait, maybe it's that each partner gets 8% of the total profit as their share. No, that can't be right because the question says 8% on their investment.

Wait, perhaps the 8% is the interest each gets on their investment, but taken from the profit. So the total interest is $5,600 + $7,200 = $12,800. But the profit is only $10,000, so this isn't possible. Therefore, perhaps the 8% is a preferred return, and the remaining profit is split equally.

Wait, but in that case, the 8% is a preferred return, which must be paid before any other distribution. So if the profit is $10k, which is less than the total preferred ($12.8k), then each partner would get a portion of their 8% based on the available profit.

Wait, that sounds complicated. Let me think again. Maybe the question is structured differently. Perhaps the way the profit is split is that each partner first gets 8% on their investment, and then the remaining profit is split equally. But since the total of the 8% exceeds the profit, that can't happen. So maybe the 8% is applied only up to the available profit.

Alternatively, perhaps the 8% is calculated on their investment, but the profit is only $10,000, so the 8% for each is limited by the profit.

Wait, perhaps the way to think about this is: the profit is first allocated to pay each partner 8% on their investment, but since the total needed is $12,800 and profit is $10k, each partner gets a proportion of their 8% based on the profit.

So the total 8% is $12,800. But the profit is $10,000. So the ratio is 10,000 / 12,800 ≈ 0.78125, or 78.125%.

So each partner gets 78.125% of their 8% interest.

So A1's interest would be $5,600 * (10,000 / 12,800) = let's calculate that.

10,000 / 12,800 = 10000 ÷ 12800 ≈ 0.78125.

So $5,600 * 0.78125 = let's see: 5,600 * 0.7 = 3,920; 5,600 * 0.08125 = approx 5,600 * 0.08 = 448, plus 5,600 * 0.00125=7. So 448+7=455. So total approx 3,920 + 455 = 4,375.

Similarly, Bob's interest would be $7,200 * 0.78125. 7,200 * 0.7 = 5,040. 7,200 * 0.08 = 576, plus 7,200 * 0.00125=9. So 576+9=585. So total 5,040 + 585=5,625.

So together, that's 4,375 + 5,625 = 10,000, which matches the profit.

But wait, the question says each partner receives 8% on their investment and half of the balance. Hmm, perhaps after paying the 8%, the remaining is split equally. But in this case, after paying the 8%, there's no remaining profit because the 8% exceeds the total profit.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's try another approach.

The question says each partner receives 8% interest on their investment and half of the balance. So perhaps the profit is allocated as follows: each gets 8% of their investment, and the remaining profit (if any) is split equally.

But if the total 8% ($12,800) is more than the profit ($10,000), then there's no remaining balance. So each partner only gets their proportionate share of the 8% based on the available profit.

Alternatively, perhaps the 8% is a fixed amount, and the rest is split. But since the total 8% exceeds the profit, that's not possible. So maybe the 8% is just a part of each partner's share, and the rest is split.

Wait, perhaps the profit is allocated in two parts: first, each partner gets 8% on their investment, then the remaining is split equally. So let me compute that.

Total profit: $10,000.

Total 8%: A1: $5,600; Bob: $7,200. Sum: $12,800.

Since the profit is $10k, which is less than $12.8k, the 8% can't be fully paid. So perhaps each partner gets a proportion of their 8% based on the profit.

Alternatively, perhaps the 8% is a percentage of the profit, but that doesn't make sense because it's based on their investment.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to look for the correct way to split the profit.

Each partner gets 8% on their investment, which is:

A1: 0.08 * 70,000 = $5,600.

Bob: 0.08 * 90,000 = $7,200.

Total of these two is $12,800. But profit is only $10,000.

So perhaps the 8% is only paid up to the available profit. So each gets their 8% until the profit is exhausted.

Wait, but 12,800 exceeds 10,000. So the total 8% would take $10,000, leaving nothing for the balance. So each partner's share would be (their 8%) * (10,000 / 12,800).

So A1's share would be 5,600 * (10,000 / 12,800) = 5,600 * (25/32) = let's compute that.

5,600 ÷ 32 = 175. 175 * 25 = 4,375.

Similarly, Bob's share: 7,200 * (25/32) = 7,200 * 0.78125 = 5,625. Because 32 × 225 = 7200, so 225 ×25=5,625.

So each's share from the 8% part is $4,375 for A1 and $5,625 for Bob. But wait, that's the entire $10,000. But the question says each also gets half of the balance. But there's no balance left because the 8% already took all the profit. So perhaps the "and 1/2 of the balance" refers to after the 8% is allocated.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.

"Profits and losses are shared, so that each partner receives 8% interest on his investment and 1/2 of the balance."

Hmm, perhaps the way it's structured is that the profit is split such that each partner gets 8% of their investment, plus half of the remaining profit. So the steps are:

1. Calculate 8% of each partner's investment.

2. Subtract the sum of these 8% from the total profit to get the remaining balance.

3. Each partner then gets half of that remaining balance.

But wait, let's compute that.

Total profit = $10,000.

A1's 8%: $5,600.

Bob's 8%: $7,200.

Sum of 8%: $12,800.

Remaining balance: $10,000 - $12,800 = -$2,800.

Wait, that's negative. So the remaining balance is negative, meaning there's no positive balance left to split. So each partner would only get their 8% up to the available profit, and the negative balance would imply that perhaps the 8% can't be fully paid.

Alternatively, perhaps the remaining balance is after the 8% is subtracted, but if that's negative, then each partner only gets their 8% proportionally.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try another approach.

Perhaps the profit-sharing is structured so that each partner first gets 8% on their investment, and then the remaining profit is split equally. So:

Total profit = $10,000.

A1's 8%: $5,600.

Bob's 8%: $7,200.

Total 8% = $12,800.

But profit is $10,000, which is less than $12,800. So the 8% can't be fully paid. Therefore, the partners would receive a proportion of their 8% based on the available profit.

The proportion would be $10,000 / $12,800 ≈ 0.78125.

So A1 gets $5,600 * 0.78125 ≈ $4,375.

Bob gets $7,200 * 0.78125 ≈ $5,625.

Total is $10,000.

But the question also mentions that each partner receives half of the balance. Wait, perhaps after the 8% is allocated, the remaining profit is split equally. But if the 8% takes more than the profit, there's nothing left to split. So in this case, the "half of the balance" would be zero, so each partner's share is just their proportionate 8%.

So A1's share would be approximately $4,375, and Bob's would be $5,625. But looking at the options, I don't see these exact numbers. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: A1:5,600; Bob:7,200 → Sum 12,800 → Not possible.

B: 4,200 & 5,800 → Sum 10,000.

C: 3,500 & 4,500 → Sum 8,000.

D: 2,800 & 3,600 → Sum 6,400.

E: 3,800 & 5,200 → Sum 9,000.

F:4,800 & 6,400 → Sum 11,200.

G:4,500 &6,500 → Sum 11,000.

H:3,000 &4,000 → Sum 7,000.

I:3,600 &5,400 → Sum 9,000.

J:4,000 &6,000 → Sum 10,000.

Wait, J sums to 10k, with A1 getting $4k and Bob $6k.

But according to my earlier calculation, when considering the proportionate 8%, A1 gets ~$4,375 and Bob ~$5,625. But none of the options match that. Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the profit is split. Let me try another approach.

The problem states that each partner receives 8% on their investment and half of the balance. So perhaps the profit is allocated as:

Each partner's share = (8% of their investment) + (50% of the remaining profit after all 8% are paid).

But the total 8% is $12,800, which is more than the $10k profit, so the remaining would be negative, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the 8% is not a fixed amount but a way to calculate each partner's share.

Wait, perhaps the profit is split such that each partner's share is 8% of their investment plus half of what's left after both have taken their 8%.

Wait, but that's the same as before. Let me compute it again.

Total profit: $10,000.

Compute 8% for each:

A1: $5,600.

Bob: $7,200.

Total 8%: $12,800.

But profit is only $10k, so the remaining is -$2,800. That can't be right. So perhaps the approach is incorrect.

Alternative approach: Maybe the 8% is on the total profit, not on the investment. Wait, no, the question says "8% interest on his investment."

Wait, perhaps the way it's structured is that each partner gets 8% of the profit, and then the remaining is split equally. No, that doesn't fit the wording.

Alternatively, perhaps the 8% is calculated on each partner's investment, but the total of these 8% is subtracted from the profit, and the remainder is split equally.

Wait, let's compute that.

A1's 8%: $5,600.

Bob's 8%: $7,200.

Total 8%: $12,800.

Profit: $10,000.

So 8% exceeds profit. So perhaps the 8% is reduced proportionally.

The ratio is 10,000 / 12,800 ≈ 0.78125.

So A1's share: 5,600 * 0.78125 ≈ 4,375.

Bob's share: 7,200 * 0.78125 ≈ 5,625.

Then, the remaining after these would be 10,000 - (4,375 +5,625) = 0. So there's nothing left to split. Therefore, each partner's share is 4,375 and 5,625, respectively.

Looking at the options, none of them have these exact numbers. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait
