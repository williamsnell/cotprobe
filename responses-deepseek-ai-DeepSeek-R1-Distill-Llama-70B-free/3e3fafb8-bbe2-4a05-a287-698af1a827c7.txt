Okay, so I've got this insurance problem to solve. Let's see, Mr. Totten insured his store against fire loss for $350,000 at $0.95 per $100, and the contents for $500,000 at $0.86 per $100. He canceled the policy on July 6, and I need to find his refund.

Hmm, I think the first step is to calculate the total premium he paid when he took out the policy. Insurance premiums are usually calculated by taking the insured amount, dividing by 100, and then multiplying by the rate. So for the store, it's $350,000 divided by 100 times $0.95. Let me do that: 350,000 / 100 is 3,500. 3,500 times 0.95 is... let's see, 3,500 * 0.95. Well, 3,500 times 1 is 3,500, so 0.95 is 3,500 minus 5% of 3,500. 5% of 3,500 is 175, so 3,500 - 175 equals 3,325. So the store premium is $3,325.

For the contents, it's $500,000 at $0.86 per $100. So 500,000 divided by 100 is 5,000. 5,000 times 0.86 is 4,300. So the contents premium is $4,300.

Adding those together, the total premium he paid upfront is 3,325 + 4,300. Let's add those: 3,000 + 4,000 is 7,000, and 325 + 300 is 625, so total 7,625. So he paid $7,625 in total when he took the policy.

Now, he canceled the policy on July 6. The question is about the refund. I think that when you cancel an insurance policy, you get a prorated refund based on the time the policy was in effect. So I need to calculate how much time had passed since January 3 to July 6, and then determine what portion of the premium is refundable.

Wait, but how exactly is the refund calculated? I remember that insurance policies often have a short-rate cancellation, but sometimes it's prorated. Wait, the problem doesn't specify, but since it's about a refund, I think it's a prorated cancellation, meaning he gets back a proportion of the premium based on the time left.

So first, I need to figure out how many months the policy was in effect. The policy started on January 3 and was canceled on July 6. Let's count the full months he had coverage.

January: From the 3rd to the end of January. Well, the exact days might matter, but since the problem doesn't specify, maybe we can approximate. Alternatively, perhaps it's assumed that each month is considered a full month unless otherwise stated.

Wait, perhaps it's better to count the number of months from January 3 to July 6. Let me think: January has 31 days, so from Jan 3 to Jan 31 is 28 days. Then, February: 28 days. March: 31, April: 30, May:31, June:30. Wait, but he canceled on July 6, so June is a full month.

Wait, wait, let me recount. From January 3 to July 6 is how many months?

January: from 3rd to 31st: 29 days (including the 3rd?), no, actually, if you start on the 3rd, then the days in January after the 3rd would be 31 - 3 + 1 = 29 days. But maybe for the sake of calculation, they consider each month as a full month. Alternatively, perhaps the policy is for a certain term, say, a year, but he's canceling after a certain period.

Wait, the problem states he took the policy on Jan 3 and canceled on July 6. So how many months is that?

Let me list the months:

January: 3rd to 31st → 29 days.

February: 28 days.

March:31

April:30

May:31

June:30

Wait, but he canceled on July 6, so June is a full month. So from Jan 3 to June 30 is 5 full months and the partial month of January.

Wait, that's a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe the policy is considered to cover up to the end of the month before cancellation. So if he cancels on July 6, the last covered day is June 30.

So the period covered is from Jan 3 to June 30.

Wait, but how to calculate the exact time. Let me think if there's another approach. Let me count the number of days:

From Jan 3 to July 6 is:

January: 31 - 3 + 1 = 29 days (including the 3rd and the 31st).

Wait, no, because if you start on the 3rd, the days remaining in January are 31 - 3 + 1 = 29 days (since day 3 is day 1).

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the total days between Jan 3 and July 6.

Jan: 31 days. So from Jan 3 to Jan 31: 29 days (since 31-3+1=29).

Feb: 28 days.

March:31

April:30

May:31

June:30

July:6 days (since he canceled on July 6, so up to July 5 is covered? Or is it including July 6? Hmm, maybe up to July 5.)

Wait, but the policy is canceled on July 6, so coverage ends on July 5. So total days:

Jan:29

Feb:28 → total so far 57

March:31 → 88

April:30 → 118

May:31 → 149

June:30 → 179

July:5 → 184 days.

Wait, so total of 184 days of coverage.

But policies are usually annual, so 365 days. So the fraction of the year would be 184/365.

Wait, but perhaps the refund is calculated based on the number of months. So if he had the policy for 6 months, he gets a 50% refund. But that's a simplification. Alternatively, perhaps it's exact days.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe the problem assumes that each month is considered as a full month, regardless of the days. Let me think: from Jan 3 to June 30 is 6 months. So 6 months coverage, 6 out of 12, so 50% refund.

Wait, but that might not be accurate because the exact time is a bit less than 6 months. Wait, no: from Jan 3 to June 30 is about 5 and 3/4 months, but perhaps the insurance company calculates it as 6 months.

Alternatively, let's think about when the policy was in effect. If he took it on Jan 3, the first month is January, then February, March, April, May, June. That's 6 full months. So the time period is 6 months. So he's entitled to a refund for the remaining 6 months.

Wait, but the policy term isn't stated. Is it a one-year policy? Probably, because the standard is annual. So if he cancels after 6 months, he's used up half the policy, so the refund would be half the premium.

Wait, but maybe not exactly. Because some policies calculate the refund based on the exact time, like the number of days. Let's see, if the policy is for a year (365 days), and he used 184 days, then the unused is 365 - 184 = 181 days. So the refund would be (181/365) times the total premium.

Alternatively, perhaps the refund is calculated on a pro rata basis, meaning the unearned premium is returned.

So first, let's calculate the total premium, which was $7,625 as I figured earlier.

If the policy is for a year, the total premium is for 12 months. So the amount earned by the insurer is based on the time the policy was in force. The rest is returned.

So the time in force is from Jan 3 to July 6. Let's calculate the exact number of days.

Jan: 31 days. From Jan 3 to Jan 31 is 29 days.

Feb: 28

March:31

April:30

May:31

June:30

July:6 (since he canceled on July 6, so coverage ends on July 5, which is 5 days into July.

So total days:

29 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) +31 (Mar) +30 (Apr) +31 (May) +30 (Jun) +5 (Jul) = 

Let me add these up:

29 +28 =57

57+31=88

88+30=118

118+31=149

149+30=179

179+5=184 days.

So total days covered: 184.

Total policy term: 365 days (assuming it's a non-leap year).

So the fraction of the policy used is 184/365.

The unearned premium would be the total premium multiplied by (1 - 184/365) = (365-184)/365 = 181/365.

So the refund is total premium * (181/365).

So let's compute that.

Total premium is $7,625.

7,625 * (181/365).

Let me compute 7,625 * 181 first, then divide by 365.

Wait, maybe I can simplify this.

Alternatively, let's see if 365 divides into 7,625.

Wait, 365 times 20 is 7,300. So 7,625 is 7,300 + 325. So 20 + (325/365) = 20 + 0.890... So 20.89 approximately.

Wait, that's perhaps not helpful. Alternatively, let's compute 7,625 * 181.

Wait, 7,625 * 180 = ?

7,625 * 100 = 762,500

7,625 * 80 = 610,000

So 762,500 + 610,000 = 1,372,500.

Then, add 7,625 for the extra 1: 1,372,500 + 7,625 = 1,380,125.

Now, divide 1,380,125 by 365.

Let me compute 365 into 1,380,125.

Well, 365 times 3,000 is 1,095,000.

Subtract: 1,380,125 -1,095,000=285,125.

365 * 700=255,500.

Subtract: 285,125 -255,500=29,625.

365 * 80=29,200.

Subtract: 29,625-29,200=425.

365 goes into 425 once, with 60 left (425-365=60).

So total is 3,000 +700+80+1= 3,781 with a remainder of 60.

So 3,781 and 60/365.

Wait, so 3,781. Approximately.

Wait, but wait, 365 * 3,781 = ?

Well, 3,781 * 365.

Wait, maybe I should compute 3,781 * 300 = 1,134,300.

3,781 *60=226,860.

3,781*5=18,905.

Adding them: 1,134,300 +226,860 =1,361,160 +18,905=1,380,065. Hmm, but earlier we had 1,380,125, so the difference is 60. So 3,781 *365=1,380,065. So 1,380,125 is 60 more. So 3,781 + (60/365)= approx 3,781.164.

So the refund is approximately $3,781.16.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them match that. The highest option is G: $5,125.00, and others are lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my approach. Maybe the refund is calculated differently. Alternatively, maybe the policy is for a 6-month term, but that doesn't make much sense given the context.

Wait, perhaps I should instead calculate the number of months and base the refund on that, assuming each month is considered full.

So from Jan 3 to June 30 is 6 months. So if the policy is annual, he's used 6 months, so the refund is 6/12 = 50% of the premium.

So 50% of $7,625 is $3,812.50.

Looking at the options, option I is $3,850.50, which is close but not exact. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the exact calculation based on months, but perhaps each month is considered 30 days. So let's try that.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the refund is calculated as (12 - number_of_months_used) / 12 * total_premium.

So he used 6 months (from Jan to June), so refund is 6/12 * 7,625 = 3,812.50.

But that's not an option. The closest is option I: $3,850.50.

Wait, perhaps the months are calculated as full months, but the exact days are used to compute the fraction. Alternatively, maybe the refund is the total premium minus the earned premium, which is calculated based on the time passed.

Wait, another thought: maybe the policy is being canceled, and the refund is for the unexpired term. So the earned premium is for the time the policy was in effect, and the refund is the unearned part.

So the earned premium would be (time_in_force / total_policy_term) * total_premium.

So if the time in force is 184 days, and the policy is 365 days, the earned premium is (184/365) *7,625.

So the unearned premium (refund) is 7,625 - (184/365 *7,625) = 7,625 * (1 - 184/365) = 7,625 * (181/365).

Wait, which is what I calculated before, around $3,781.16. But none of the options match that.

Looking back at the options, option F is $4,651.25, option E is $4,000.75, option G is $5,125, option I is $3,850.50.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is done on a 360-day year, which is common in some financial calculations.

So let me recalculate using 360 days instead of 365.

So time_in_force is 184 days.

Earned premium: (184/360)*7,625.

So 184/360 = approx 0.5111.

0.5111 *7,625 = ?

Well, 7,625 *0.5=3,812.5

7,625 *0.0111≈ 7,625 *0.01 =76.25, 7,625 *0.0011≈8.3875 → total 76.25 +8.3875=84.6375.

So total earned premium ≈3,812.5 +84.6375≈3,897.14.

So unearned is 7,625 -3,897.14≈3,727.86.

Still not matching any options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the refund is calculated on a monthly basis, with each month considered as 1/12 of the premium, regardless of the days.

So if he had the policy for 6 months, he gets a refund of (12-6)/12=1/2 of the premium.

So 7,625 * (6/12)=3,812.50.

But again, the options don't have that. Option I is $3,850.50, which is close but not exact.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the total premium. Let me double-check.

Store: $350,000 at $0.95 per $100.

So 350,000 /100 =3,500.

3,500 *0.95= 3,325.

Contents: 500,000 at $0.86 per 100.

500,000/100=5,000.

5,000 *0.86=4,300.

Total premium:3,325+4,300=7,625. That's correct.

So I must have made a mistake elsewhere. Maybe the time period is different.

Wait, perhaps he only paid for 6 months, so the total premium is for 6 months, not annual. But that doesn't make sense because the rate is per $100 per year, I think.

Wait, looking back, the problem states the rates are "at $.95 per $100, as well as ... $.86 per $100." I think these are annual rates. So the total premium is annual, and he's canceling after part of the year, so the refund is based on the unused portion.

Wait, perhaps the question isn't about a one-year policy. Maybe the policy was only for a certain term, but the problem doesn't specify. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the policy is for one year, but the refund is calculated by multiplying the unexpired term's rate.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the refund is 350,000 *0.95/100 * (unexpired months) + 500,000 *0.86/100 * unexpired months.

Wait, no, that wouldn't make sense. Because the premium was already paid upfront. The refund is a portion of the total premium.

Wait, maybe the question is simpler. Perhaps the refund is based on the number of months remaining, multiplied by the monthly premium.

So let's compute the monthly premium first.

Total premium is $7,625 per year. So monthly premium is 7,625 /12 ≈636.04 per month.

If he cancels after 6 months, he would have 6 months remaining. So refund is 6 *636.04 ≈3,816.24, which is close to option I: $3,850.50.

But it's not exact. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is based on exact months, considering the exact days.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by calculating the unearned premium as the total premium multiplied by the ratio of the unexpired term to the total term, assuming the term is a year.

But without exact days, perhaps it's assumed to be 6 months. So 6/12=0.5. So 7,625 *0.5=3,812.50. But that's not an option.

Wait, looking at the options, option I is $3,850.50. Let me see if that's 7,625 multiplied by something.

3,850.50 /7,625 = 0.504
