Question:

A man filed a federal diversity action against a bus company, seeking damages for injuries he had sustained in an accident while riding a bus owned by the company. The man demanded a jury trial. After the parties' attorneys examined the prospective jurors and exercised their challenges, six jurors and two alternate jurors were chosen. During the trial, two jurors became ill and were replaced by the alternate jurors. At the conclusion of replaced by the alternate jurors. At the conclusion of the trial, a third juror also became ill, and the court excused that juror. The parties' attorneys stipulated to the return of a verdict from a five-person jury. The jury then deliberated and returned a verdict for the company. The man timely filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that the five-person jury was not large enough to return a verdict. Should the court grant the motion?

Options:

A: No, because the verdict was reached before the third juror was excused.
B: No, because the court properly excused the three jurors due to illness.
C: Yes, because there must be at least six jurors on a federal civil jury.
D: Yes, because there must be at least 12 jurors on a federal civil jury.
E: Yes, because the replacement of jurors during the trial invalidated the verdict.
F: Yes, because the stipulation of the attorneys cannot override federal jury size requirements.
G: No, because the parties stipulated to a verdict from a jury of fewer than six jurors.
H: No, because the illness of jurors is a valid reason for reducing the jury size.
I: No, because the remaining jurors were sufficient to reach a unanimous decision.
J: Yes, because the man was not given a fair trial due to the reduced jury size.

Okay, so I've got this question here about federal civil procedure, specifically dealing with jury trials. Let me try to unpack it step by step. 

The scenario is a man suing a bus company in federal court under diversity jurisdiction. He's seeking damages for injuries from a bus accident. He asked for a jury trial. So far, so good. 

Now, during the jury selection, they picked six jurors and two alternates. Wait, that's interesting. I thought federal juries are usually larger, but maybe civil cases can have smaller juries? I remember that in federal courts, civil cases can have juries as small as six people, right? So that's six main jurors and two alternates.

Then, during the trial, two jurors get ill and are replaced by the alternates. So now, the six main jurors are intact because the two alternates filled in. But then, after that, a third juror gets ill, and the court excuses that juror. So now, we're down to five jurors. 

The parties' attorneys stipulated to returning a verdict with five people. So both sides agreed to this. The jury then deliberated and gave a verdict for the company. Now, the man is asking for a new trial because he thinks a five-person jury isn't enough.

The question is whether the court should grant this motion. The options are from A to J.

I need to recall the federal rules about jury size. I remember that in federal civil cases, the jury can be as small as six, but the parties can also agree to a smaller number. Let me think. Oh, right, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 48, a federal civil jury must have at least six members. But wait, can it be smaller if the parties agree? Or is six the minimum, and you can't go below that even with stipulation?

Wait, no, I think the federal rule allows for a jury of six, and the parties can stipulate to fewer, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps the minimum is six, and you can't go below that. Or maybe the rules have changed? Let me think.

Wait, I believe that in federal courts, the civil jury is typically six people. But I also recall that the Supreme Court has held that the Constitution doesn't require a 12-person jury in civil cases. So federal civil juries can be six. Now, can they be less than six? I'm not so sure. 

Wait, looking back, I think that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require a minimum of six jurors for a civil jury. So even if the parties stipulate, you can't go below six. Because the rule is that a jury must have at least six, so it can't be five. 

So in this case, the jury ended up with five. The parties agreed, but if the federal rule requires a minimum of six, then the verdict would be invalid. So the man's motion for a new trial should be granted because five is less than the minimum required.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option C says yes because there must be at least six jurors on a federal civil jury. Option F says yes because the stipulation can't override federal jury size requirements. Option G says no because parties stipulated. 

Wait, so which one is correct? If the federal rule sets the minimum at six, then even with a stipulation, you can't have fewer than six. So the court should grant the motion, meaning options C or F.

Option C says yes because of six as the minimum. Option F says yes because stipulation can't override. 

But I think the federal rules allow for a jury of six, but the parties can stipulate to a smaller number. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the rule is the minimum. So I think the minimum is six, so you can't have five. So the stipulation is invalid.

Wait, another angle: I remember that under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 39(c), if the court finds it necessary, it can excuse a juror and proceed with a smaller jury, but only if the parties stipulate. So if the parties agree, the court can go down to as low as five? Or is the minimum six?

Wait, let me think. Rule 39(c) says that if, before the jury is sworn, the parties stipulate that the jury may consist of fewer than the prescribed number, the court may excuse the excess jurors. But I think the minimum under the rule is six. So you can have a jury as small as six, but not smaller. So if the parties stipulate to five, that would be below the minimum, and the court can't accept that. 

So in this scenario, after the third juror was excused, the jury was five. But the parties stipulated. But since the federal rule requires at least six, the stipulation can't override that. So the verdict is invalid. Therefore, the court should grant the motion for a new trial.

Looking back at the options, option C says yes because there must be at least six. Option F says yes because stipulation can't override. So both C and F seem correct, but which one is the actual rule.

Wait, another approach: The Seventh Amendment doesn't require a jury of twelve in civil cases, but it does require that the jury be unbiased and that the parties have a right to a jury trial. However, the federal rules set the minimum number of jurors. So if the rules say six, then five is invalid even with stipulation.

So the correct answer would be C or F. Option C says yes because six is required. Option F says yes because stipulation can't override. So which is the correct reasoning.

I think the correct answer is C: Yes, because there must be at least six on a federal civil jury. Because the rule requires a minimum of six, regardless of stipulation. So the court can't accept a jury of five. So the man's motion should be granted, so the answer is C.

Wait, but another perspective: The initial jury was six, and two alternates were used. Then a third became ill, leading to five. The parties stipulated. But the minimum is six, so the stipulation is irrelevant because you can't have a jury smaller than six. So the verdict is invalid, and a new trial is needed.

So the correct answer is C: Yes, because there must be at least six jurors on a federal civil jury.

But wait, let me double-check. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 48(b) says that a verdict may be returned by a jury of fewer than six if the parties stipulate, but only after the jury has heard the evidence. Wait, no: Rule 48(b) allows for the verdict to be returned by not fewer than six, but only if the parties stipulate. Wait, no, the rule says:

"(b) Return of a Verdict. A jury must return a verdict. It may do so by returning a verdict on all the issues or, if the court permits, on some of the issues. The verdict must be unanimous unless the parties—having the court's permission—otherwise stipulate."

Wait, that's not directly addressing the size. Let me check Rule 39. Rule 39(c):

"(c) Juror Unable to Continue. If during the trial a juror is unable to continue, the trial may proceed with the remaining jurors if:

(1) the juror's inability to continue is because of illness or other incapacitation;

(2) the court is satisfied that the juror's continued service would be impossible or would cause undue hardship to the juror; and

(3) the parties stipulate to proceed with the remaining jurors."

So under this rule, the court can proceed with fewer than six only if the parties stipulate. Wait, but the initial jury size was six, right? So if a juror is excused, the jury would be five, but only if the parties stipulate. 

Wait, but if the federal rules require that the jury have at least six, then Rule 39(c) can't reduce it below that. Or does Rule 39(c) allow for a smaller jury if the parties agree?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me see. Rule 48(a) says, "When the jury has completed its deliberation, it shall return a verdict to the court." Rule 48(b) says the verdict must be unanimous unless stipulated otherwise. 

Wait, perhaps I should refer to the minimum number under Rule 38 and the relevant rules. I think that the minimum number for a civil jury is six, as stated in Rule 38(b), which says, "When a jury trial has been demanded under Rule 38, the trial must be by jury unless... (2) the parties... stipulate that the jury may consist of fewer than 12 members... but not fewer than 6 members."

Wait, no, Rule 38(b) is about when a jury trial is demanded, and it says that the trial will be by jury unless the parties stipulate otherwise, but the jury must consist of "fewer than 12 but not fewer than 6." So the minimum is six. So the parties can stipulate to a jury of six or more, but not fewer than six. Wait, no: Rule 38(b) says that a jury can have fewer than 12, but not fewer than 6. So the minimum is six, and the maximum is 12, but the court can decide the exact number within that range, subject to stipulation.

So if the parties stipulate to a jury of five, that's below the minimum, which is six. So the court can't accept that. Therefore, the stipulation to a five-person jury is invalid, and the verdict is invalid. Thus, the man's motion for a new trial should be granted.

So the correct answer would be C: Yes, because there must be at least six jurors on a federal civil jury.

But wait, looking at the options again:

Option C: Yes, because there must be at least six jurors on a federal civil jury.

Option F: Yes, because the stipulation of the attorneys cannot override federal jury size requirements.

So both C and F are making similar points, but C is more about the minimum, F about the stipulation not overriding.

Which is the better answer? The federal rule requires a minimum of six, so even with stipulation, you can't go below six. So the stipulation is irrelevant because it's trying to go below the minimum. Therefore, the verdict is invalid, and the motion should be granted.

Thus, the correct answer is C.

The question revolves around whether a federal civil jury can return a valid verdict with only five jurors when the federal rules require a minimum of six. In this case, the initial jury consisted of six jurors and two alternates. During the trial, two jurors became ill and were replaced by the alternates, maintaining six jurors. However, a third juror later became ill, leaving only five jurors. The parties stipulated to proceeding with the five-person jury, which returned a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff then moved for a new trial, arguing that a five-person jury was insufficient.

Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 38(b), a federal civil jury must consist of at least six members. While the parties can stipulate to a jury smaller than twelve, they cannot stipulate to a jury smaller than six. Therefore, the parties' stipulation to proceed with five jurors was invalid, as it fell below the minimum required by federal law. As a result, the verdict returned by the five-person jury was invalid, and the plaintiff's motion for a new trial should be granted.

Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C: Yes, because there must be at least six jurors on a federal civil jury.**

This option accurately reflects the federal requirement that a civil jury must have at least six members, regardless of any stipulation by the parties.

Answer: C
