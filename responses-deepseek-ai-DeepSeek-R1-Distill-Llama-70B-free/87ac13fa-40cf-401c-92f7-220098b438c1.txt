Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about percent dissociation of acetic acid, HC2H3O2. Hmm, I remember that percent dissociation has something to do with how much of the acid breaks down into ions in solution. The question says the chemist wants it to be 1% dissociated, and the K_disso is given as 1.8 × 10^-5. I'm supposed to find the required concentration. 

Wait, I think the formula for percent dissociation is (concentration of H+ ions / initial concentration of the acid) multiplied by 100. But wait, no, wait. Oh right, for weak acids that dissociate partially, the percent dissociation is calculated based on the amount that ionizes. So, if the initial concentration is C, and it dissociates x amount, then the percent is (x/C)*100.

The acid dissociation constant, Ka, is given by the expression Ka = [H+][A-]/[HA], right? For acetic acid, HA is HC2H3O2, which dissociates into H+ and C2H3O2^-.

So, let's set it up. Let's say the initial concentration is C. At equilibrium, the concentration of H+ is x, same as C2H3O2^- (since it's a 1:1 ratio), and the remaining HC2H3O2 is C - x. 

But wait, the percent dissociation is 1%, so (x / C) * 100 = 1, which means x = 0.01 C.

Now, substituting into the Ka expression:

Ka = x^2 / (C - x).

But since the dissociation is small (only 1%), x is much smaller than C, so C - x ≈ C. So we can approximate:

Ka ≈ x^2 / C.

Wait, but x is 0.01 C, so substituting that in:

Ka ≈ (0.01 C)^2 / C = (0.0001 C²) / C = 0.0001 C.

So, Ka = 1.8e-5 = 0.0001 C.

Wait, solving for C would be Ka / 0.0001.

So C = (1.8e-5) / (1e-4) ) = 0.18 M? Wait, that can't be right because looking at the options, I don't see that. Hmm, did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me check the steps again. So:

Given that percent dissociation is 1% → x = 0.01 C.

Ka = (x)^2 / (C - x) ≈ x² / C when x is small.

So 1.8e-5 = ( (0.01 C)^2 ) / C → 1.8e-5 = (0.0001 C²) / C → 1.8e-5 = 0.0001 C → C = (1.8e-5) / (1e-4) ) → 1.8e-5 / 1e-4 = 0.18 M.

Hmm, but none of the options show 0.18 M. The options are A: 1.8e-2, D: 1.76e-1, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approximation. Let's recalculate without approximation.

Wait, let's write it without approximation:

Ka = x² / (C - x) 

But x = 0.01 C, so:

Ka = ( (0.01 C)^2 ) / ( C - 0.01 C ) 

Simplify denominator: 0.99 C.

So:

1.8e-5 = (0.0001 C²) / (0.99 C) → 1.8e-5 = (0.0001 C ) / 0.99.

Multiply both sides by 0.99:

1.8e-5 * 0.99 = 0.0001 C → 1.782e-5 = 0.0001 C → C = 1.782e-5 / 0.0001 → 1.782e-5 / 1e-4 = 0.1782 M.

Still about 0.178 M, which is approximately 0.18 M. None of the options match. Hmm, maybe I've messed up the approach.

Wait another thought: Maybe I should consider that the percent dissociation is 1%, so the degree of dissociation α is 0.01. So, for a weak acid, the Ka expression can be written as:

Ka = (α^2 * C) / (1 - α) 

But when α is small, like 0.01, 1 - α ≈ 1, so Ka ≈ α² C.

So Ka ≈ (0.01)^2 * C → 1e-4 * C = 1.8e-5 → C = 1.8e-5 / 1e-4 → 0.18 M.

Again, same result. So perhaps the correct answer isn't in the options, but wait, let me check the options again.

Looking back: Option D is 1.76e-1 M, which is 0.176 M, close to my 0.18. Hmm, perhaps rounding gives 0.18, which is 1.8e-1. Oh wait, 0.18 is 1.8e-1, but option D is 1.76e-1. So it's about 0.176, which is a bit lower.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate more accurately without approximation.

So, let's be precise. Let's write the equation without approximation:

Ka = x² / (C - x), and x = α C = 0.01 C.

So substituting:

Ka = ( (0.01 C )^2 ) / (C - 0.01 C ) → 1.8e-5 = (0.0001 C² ) / ( 0.99 C ) → 1.8e-5 = 0.0001 C / 0.99 → C = (1.8e-5 * 0.99 ) / 0.0001 → (1.782e-5) / 1e-4 → 0.1782 M.

So approximately 0.178 M, which is 1.78e-1 M. Wait, looking at the options, option D is 1.76e-1, which is 0.176. Hmm, could that be due to more precise calculation?

Wait another approach. Let me solve it without approximation.

Let me define α as 0.01. So the equation is:

Ka = (α^2 C) / (1 - α) → 1.8e-5 = ( (0.01)^2 * C ) / (1 - 0.01 ) → 1.8e-5 = (0.0001 C) / 0.99 → 0.0001 C = 1.8e-5 * 0.99 → 1.782e-5 → C = 1.782e-5 / 0.0001 → 1.782e-5 / 1e-4 → 0.1782 M.

So that's 0.1782 M, which is 1.782e-1 M. Looking at the options, perhaps the closest is option D: 1.76e-1, but wait, maybe I should calculate more accurately.

Wait, maybe the exact solution uses the quadratic formula.

So, let's write the exact equation: Ka = x²/(C - x), with x=0.01 C.

So substituting x: 1.8e-5 = (0.01 C )^2 / (C - 0.01 C )

Multiply both sides by (C - 0.01 C ) → 1.8e-5 (C - 0.01 C ) = (0.01 C )^2 → 1.8e-5 (0.99 C ) = 0.0001 C² → 1.782e-5 C = 0.0001 C² → 0.0001 C² - 1.782e-5 C = 0 → Factor:

C (0.0001 C - 1.782e-5 ) = 0 → C=0 is one solution (not possible), so 0.0001 C = 1.782e-5 → C = (1.782e-5 ) / 0.0001 → 1.782e-5 / 1e-4 = 0.1782 M.

Wait, same result. So 0.1782 M is approximately 0.178 M.

Looking again at the options:

Option D is 1.76 ×10^-1 M → 0.176 M.

Option A is 1.8e-2 → 0.018 M.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps I should set up the problem differently.

Wait another thought: Maybe the percent dissociation is (2x)/C *100%, but no, for a 1:1 dissociation, it's x/C. So I think that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the formula where percent dissociation is sqrt( (Ka) / C ) * 100%. Wait, from Ka ≈ x²/C, x = sqrt(Ka C ). Then percent dissociation is (sqrt(Ka C ) / C ) *100 = sqrt( Ka / C ) *100.

Setting percent dissociation to 1%:

1 = sqrt( (1.8e-5) / C ) *100 → divide both sides by 100 → 0.01 = sqrt(1.8e-5 / C ) → square both sides → 0.0001 = 1.8e-5 / C → C = 1.8e-5 / 0.0001 → 0.18 M.

Hmm, same result again. So it's 0.18 M, but none of the options match. Wait, perhaps the options have a typo, but looking at the options again, I see option D is 1.76e-1 M (0.176 M), which is close to 0.18 but not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the equation without assuming x is small. Let me write the equation without approximation.

Ka = x²/(C - x) → 1.8e-5 = x²/(C - x).

But x is 0.01 C, so substituting x=0.01 C:

1.8e-5 = (0.0001 C²) / (C - 0.01 C ) → 1.8e-5 = 0.0001 C² / (0.99 C ) → 1.8e-5 = (0.0001 C ) / 0.99 → 0.0001 C = 1.8e-5 * 0.99 → 0.0001 C = 1.782e-5 → C = 1.782e-5 / 0.0001 → C = 0.1782 M.

Again same 0.1782 M. So perhaps the correct option is not present. Or perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, perhaps the given options have a typo. Alternatively, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me think: perhaps the initial assumption that x=Cα is correct, but perhaps using the exact quadratic equation.

Let me set up the equation properly.

The dissociation is HC2H3O2 → H+ + C2H3O2^-

Initial: C, 0, 0.

Change: -x, +x, +x.

At equilibrium: C - x, x, x.

So, Ka = (x^2) / (C - x ) = 1.8e-5.

But percent dissociation is (x/C) *100 = 1 → x=0.01 C.

Substituting into Ka:

( (0.01 C )^2 ) / (C - 0.01 C ) = 1.8e-5 → (0.0001 C² ) / (0.99 C ) = 1.8e-5 → 0.0001 C / 0.99 = 1.8e-5 → C = (1.8e-5 * 0.99 ) / 0.0001 → (1.782e-5 ) / 1e-4 → 0.1782 M.

Hmm, so I'm getting 0.1782 M, which is approximately 0.178 M. Looking back at the options, option D is 1.76e-1, which is 0.176 M. That's close but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps I've made an error in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate without substituting x=0.01 C. Let me try solving the equation without substitution.

Let me let x be the concentration that dissociates. Then, percent dissociation is (x/C)*100 = 1 → x = 0.01 C.

Then, the equilibrium concentrations are [HC2H3O2] = C - x = C - 0.01 C = 0.99 C.

[H+] = x = 0.01 C.

So, Ka = (0.01 C )² / (0.99 C ) = (0.0001 C²) / (0.99 C ) = (0.0001 C ) / 0.99.

Set equal to 1.8e-5:

0.0001 C / 0.99 = 1.8e-5 → Multiply both sides by 0.99:

0.0001 C = 1.8e-5 * 0.99 → 1.782e-5 → C = 1.782e-5 / 0.0001 → 0.1782 M.

Same result. So the correct concentration is approximately 0.178 M, which is 1.78e-1 M. Looking at the options, option D is 1.76e-1, which is a bit lower. Could this be due to rounding during calculations?

Wait, 1.782e-1 is 0.1782, which is closer to 0.18, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong approach.

Wait, maybe the problem is using the formula where percent dissociation is (2x/C) *100%, but that would be for something that produces two ions, but HC2H3O2 dissociates into two ions: H+ and acetate. So maybe it's x = [H+], which is same as [A-], so the percent dissociation is x/C ×100. So that approach is correct.

Another possibility: Maybe the given K is actually K_w or something else? No, the question says K_diss is 1.8e-5, which is the same as Ka for acetic acid.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution is dilute, but I don't think that affects the calculation here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to use the approximation that x is much smaller than C, but in this case, 1% is not that small, so the approximation might not hold. Wait, but 1% is usually considered small enough for the approximation to be valid, but maybe in this case, it's slightly off.

Wait, let me try solving without approximation. Let's set up the quadratic equation.

We have:

Ka = x² / (C - x )

But x = 0.01 C → substitute:

Ka = (0.01 C )² / ( C (1 - 0.01 ) ) → 1.8e-5 = (0.0001 C² ) / ( 0.99 C ) → same as before → 1.8e-5 = 0.0001 C / 0.99 → C = 0.1782 M.

So, I'm getting the same answer. So perhaps the correct option isn't present. But looking at the options, D is 1.76e-1, which is 0.176, which is close to 0.178. Maybe it's a rounding difference.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately:

1.8e-5 = (0.01 C )² / (C - 0.01 C )

Multiply both sides by (C - 0.01 C ):

1.8e-5 (C - 0.01 C ) = (0.01 C )² → 1.8e-5 (0.99 C ) = 0.0001 C² → 1.782e-5 C = 0.0001 C² → 0.0001 C² - 1.782e-5 C =0 → C(0.0001 C - 1.782e-5 ) =0 → C=0 (invalid) or C= 1.782e-5 / 0.0001 → 0.1782 M.

Hmm, perhaps the options are expecting an approximate value, so 0.18 M. But none of the options have that. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the initial setup.

Wait another angle: Maybe the percent dissociation is given as 1%, so the H+ concentration is 0.01 C, but the solution also has the acetate ion at 0.01 C. So, the total ions are 0.02 C, but that doesn't make sense because each HC2H3O2 releases one H+ and one acetate. So, [H+] = [acetate] = x =0.01 C.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is not about the percent dissociation but about the degree of dissociation. But I think that's the same thing. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. Let's see:

Option D:1.76 ×10^-1 → 0.176 M.

Option A: 1.8 ×10^-2 →0.018 M.

Option H:5.4 ×1e-3 →0.0054 M.

Option G:9e-3 →0.009 M.

Option J:1.8e-4 →0.00018 M.

Option D is 0.176 M, which is very close to our calculated 0.178 M. So perhaps the intended answer is D, considering some rounding.

Wait, maybe the exact calculation without approximation gives a slightly different value. Let me compute more accurately.

Compute C = (1.8e-5 * 0.99) / 0.0001 → 1.8e-5 is 0.000018, multiplied by 0.
