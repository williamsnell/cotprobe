Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about accounting, specifically regarding a review of interim financial information. I'm not too familiar with all the details, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, the question is asking which of the options (A to I) applies to an accountant conducting a review. I remember that reviews are different from audits. Audits are more in-depth and require the auditor to express an opinion on whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. Reviews, on the other hand, are less extensive.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The accountant must rectify discrepancies. Hmm, I don't think that's right. The accountant's role in a review is to identify issues, not fix them. Fixing would be management's responsibility.

Option B: Conduct an in-depth investigation. No, reviews aren't as thorough as audits. They're more like limited procedures, so in-depth investigation doesn't sound right.

Option C: Maintain independence in mental attitude. Wait, independence is a key concept in audits. But for reviews, especially interim ones, I'm not sure if the same level applies. Maybe for some engagements, but perhaps reviews don't require the same independence as audits. Or do they? I'm a bit confused here.

Option D: Express an opinion on the financial statements. I think in a review, the accountant provides a conclusion, not an opinion. Audits require opinions, reviews are more limited, so the accountant might say whether anything came to their attention that indicates material misstatement.

Option E: Take on the role of financial advisor. No, that's not part of a review. The accountant's role is to review, not advise.

Option F: Perform an audit of all transactions. Definitely not. Reviews are not audits. So this is incorrect.

Option G: Report to the board of directors. I'm not certain, but I think the reporting goes to management, not necessarily directly to the board. Unless the board is the governing body, but I'm not sure if this is a requirement.

Option H: Provide advice on financial decisions. Again, that's more of a consulting or advisory role, not a review.

Option I: Obtain sufficient appropriate evidence to form a basis for an opinion. Wait, in a review, the accountant does gather evidence, but the procedures are more limited than an audit. However, the idea is to have a basis for their conclusion, which is less than an opinion.

Wait, but let me think about what a review entails. The objective of a review is to obtain limited assurance, which is less than reasonable assurance from an audit. So the accountant performs inquiries, analytical procedures, etc., to determine if any material modifications should be made to the interim financial info.

So the accountant would need to obtain sufficient evidence, but perhaps not as extensive as an audit. So option I says "obtain sufficient appropriate evidence by performing procedures to afford a reasonable basis for an opinion." Wait, but in a review, they don't express an opinion, they express a conclusion. So maybe I is incorrect because it mentions an opinion.

Wait, let me clarify. In an audit, the auditor expresses an opinion (e.g., "present fairly..."). In a review, the accountant would state something like "based on my review, nothing has come to my attention that..." So option D is about expressing an opinion, which is for audits, not reviews.

So looking back, option I says "obtain sufficient appropriate evidence... for an opinion." But in a review, they don't form an opinion, they form a conclusion. So maybe I is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up terms here. Let me think about what each engagement requires.

In an audit, the auditor must obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support their opinion. In a review, the accountant must obtain limited assurance, which would require sufficient procedures to support their conclusion, not opinion.

So perhaps the correct option is C. Because in a review engagement, the accountant must maintain independence in their mental attitude. But wait, I thought that independence is more of an audit requirement. For reviews, especially when the accountant has a continuing relationship with the client, maybe independence isn't required to the same extent.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think about the standards. For audits, independence is crucial. For reviews, maybe not as much, but perhaps the accountant is still required to be independent. Or maybe not. I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, let's consider each option again.

Option C: Maintain independence in mental attitude. So it's about the state of mind. Even if the accountant isn't independent in appearance (like being a close relative), they must at least be independent in their mental approach. I think that's a requirement for all attestation engagements, including reviews.

Option I: Obtain sufficient evidence for an opinion. But as established, in a review, you don't form an opinion, so this is incorrect.

So perhaps the correct answer is C or I.

Wait, another approach: what's the main focus of a review? The accountant's objective is to inquire and analyze to determine if the interim financial info is plausible. They don't express an opinion but a conclusion. So they do need to gather evidence, but it's for a conclusion, not an opinion.

So option I mentions "for an opinion," which is wrong. So maybe option I is not correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again about the options.

Option C says the accountant must maintain independence in mental attitude. I believe that for all professional services, including reviews, the accountant should remain objective and independent in their mental approach, regardless of whether they are independent in appearance.

So for a review engagement, the accountant must maintain independence in mental attitude. That makes option C correct.

Alternatively, what about option I? It says the accountant must obtain sufficient appropriate evidence by performing procedures to afford a reasonable basis for an opinion. But in a review, the conclusion is based on limited assurance. So perhaps the wording is wrong because it refers to an opinion, which is for audits.

So the correct answer would be C.

Wait, but another thought: in a review, the accountant is not required to be independent. For example, if the accountant is also preparing the financial statements, they might not be independent. But I think that for review engagements, the accountant is required to be independent unless certain circumstances apply. Or is it that the accountant must be independent in fact and appearance?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to recall the standards. In the US, the AICPA's standards for review engagements (SSRS) state that the accountant must be independent in fact and appearance. Or is that only for audits?

Wait, I think that for review engagements, the accountant must comply with the independence requirements established by the AICPA. So for a review of financial statements (whether interim or annual), the accountant must be independent. So independence is required, which would make option C correct because it's about maintaining independence in mental attitude.

So the correct answer is C.

To determine which option applies to an accountant conducting a review of interim financial information, it is important to understand the nature and requirements of a review engagement. A review is less extensive than an audit and aims to provide limited assurance. The accountant's role is to inquire, analyze, and assess whether the financial information is plausible, rather than expressing an opinion, which is reserved for audits.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. The accountant's role is to identify discrepancies, not rectify them. Rectification is management's responsibility.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Reviews do not require an in-depth investigation of all financial records, as they are less thorough than audits.
- **Option C**: Correct. Independence in mental attitude is a requirement for all attestation engagements, including reviews. The accountant must remain objective and unbiased, even if they are not independent in appearance.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. In a review, the accountant provides a conclusion, not an opinion. Opinions are expressed in audits.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The accountant's role in a review is limited to reviewing financial information, not acting as a financial advisor.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. A review is not an audit and does not involve auditing all financial transactions.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Reporting typically goes to management, not directly to the board of directors, unless specified.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. Providing advice on financial decisions is outside the scope of a review engagement.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. While the accountant gathers evidence, it is to support a conclusion, not an opinion. The reference to "opinion" makes this option incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **C**, as maintaining independence in mental attitude is a fundamental requirement for accountants conducting a review of interim financial information.
