Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because electric fields and potentials can get a little tricky. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that the electric field varies with the radius r from the origin as Er = –6r² + 4r + 3. They're asking for the potential difference between the origin and the point (3,4). Hmm, wait, the point is (3,4)—but that's in Cartesian coordinates, right? So the distance from the origin is the radius r. Oh wait, the electric field is given as a function of r, the radial distance, so I probably need to calculate the potential by integrating the electric field from the origin to that point.

Wait, potential difference between two points is the integral of the electric field along a path connecting those points. Oh right, because the potential V is related to the electric field E by V = -∫ E · dr, where the integral is from the starting point to the endpoint. Since the field is radial, the integral simplifies because E and dr are in the same direction.

But wait, the point (3,4) is in Cartesian coordinates, so first I need to find the radial distance r from the origin to that point. Let me calculate that. The distance r is sqrt(3² +4²) = sqrt(9+16) = sqrt(25) =5 meters. So the point is 5 meters away from the origin.

So the potential difference ΔV is the potential at (3,4) minus the potential at the origin. But wait, the question is phrased as the potential difference between the origin and the point (3,4). Oh wait, sometimes potential difference is written as V_b - V_a when moving from a to b. So if we go from the origin (a) to (3,4) (b), then ΔV = V_b - V_a = - integral from a to b of E · dr.

Wait, but sometimes the potential difference is defined as the work done to move a charge from a to b, which is V_a - V_b in that case. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me clarify. The formula is ΔV = V_b - V_a = -∫ (from a to b) E · dr. So in this case, a is the origin (r=0) and b is at r=5 m. So the integral is from 0 to 5 of E(r) dr.

So I need to compute the integral of E(r) dr from 0 to 5. Given E(r) = -6r² +4r +3. So the integral becomes the integral from 0 to 5 of (-6r² +4r +3) dr, and then take the negative of that for the potential difference.

Wait, let me write this down step by step.

ΔV = V(5) - V(0) = - ∫ (from 0 to 5) E dr.

So E is given as a function of r. Therefore, the integral is ∫ (from 0 to5) (-6r² +4r +3) dr.

Let me compute this integral first. Let's break it down.

The integral of -6r² dr is (-6) * (r³/3) )= -2 r³.

Integral of 4r dr is 4*(r²/2) = 2 r².

Integral of 3 dr is 3r.

So putting it all together, the integral from 0 to5 is [ -2r³ + 2r² +3r ] evaluated from 0 to5.

At r=5: -2*(125) + 2*(25) +3*(5) = -250 +50 +15 = -185.

At r=0: All terms are zero, so 0.

So the integral from 0 to5 is -185 -0 = -185.

Now, ΔV = - (integral) = - (-185) = +185 volts.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check the calculations. Because I'm a bit confused about the signs here.

Wait, when I compute the integral, each term:

-6r² dr: integral is -6 * (r³/3) = -2 r³.

Yes.

4r dr: integral is 4*(r²/2) = 2 r².

3 dr: integral is 3r.

So evaluating at 5: -2*(125) = -250; plus 2*(25)=+50; plus 3*5=15.

-250 +50 is -200, plus 15 is -185.

So the integral is -185.

So ΔV is - (-185) = +185 V? So the potential difference is 185 volts. Looking at the options, option B is 185 V. So the answer would be B.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the sign. Because sometimes potential differences can be tricky.

Wait, the potential difference is V(b) - V(a) = - ∫ (a to b) E dr.

So if E is the electric field pointing away from the origin (if Er is positive), then moving against the field would increase potential. But in this case, the electric field is given by Er = -6r² +4r +3. Wait, let's think about what this means.

At r=0, Er is 3 N/C, positive. So the field points radially outward at the origin.

As r increases, the electric field changes. Let me check at r=5: Er = -6*(25) +4*5 +3 = -150 +20 +3 = -127. So at r=5, the electric field is -127 N/C, which points radially inward.

Hmm. Interesting. So the electric field starts positive at the origin and becomes negative as r increases. So the field direction changes from outward to inward at some point.

But regardless, the integral is as I calculated before. So the potential at 5 meters is higher than at the origin by 185 volts.

Wait, but let me think again. Because the integral of E dr from 0 to5 is negative; that would imply that the potential increases when moving against the field.

Wait, no. The formula is that the potential difference is the negative of the integral of E from a to b. So if the integral is negative, then the potential difference is positive.

So when the integral is negative, ΔV = - (negative) = positive.

So yes, in this case, the integral is -185, so ΔV is +185 V.

Looking back at the options, option B is 185 V. So the correct answer should be B.

To determine the potential difference between the origin and the point (3, 4), we first calculate the radial distance \( r \) from the origin to the point. Using the Pythagorean theorem:

\[
r = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5 \, \text{m}.
\]

The electric field is given as \( E(r) = -6r^2 + 4r + 3 \), and the potential difference \( \Delta V \) between two points is related to the electric field by:

\[
\Delta V = V_b - V_a = -\int_a^b E(r) \, dr,
\]

where \( a = 0 \) (the origin) and \( b = 5 \) (the point (3, 4)). Substituting \( E(r) \), the integral becomes:

\[
\Delta V = -\int_0^5 \left(-6r^2 + 4r + 3\right) \, dr.
\]

Breaking the integral into terms:

1. **Integral of \( -6r^2 \):**
   \[
   \int -6r^2 \, dr = -6 \cdot \frac{r^3}{3} = -2r^3.
   \]

2. **Integral of \( 4r \):**
   \[
   \int 4r \, dr = 4 \cdot \frac{r^2}{2} = 2r^2.
   \]

3. **Integral of \( 3 \):**
   \[
   \int 3 \, dr = 3r.
   \]

Combining these, the integral becomes:

\[
\int \left(-6r^2 + 4r + 3\right) \, dr = -2r^3 + 2r^2 + 3r.
\]

Evaluating this from \( r = 0 \) to \( r = 5 \):

- At \( r = 5 \):
  \[
  -2(5)^3 + 2(5)^2 + 3(5) = -2(125) + 2(25) + 15 = -250 + 50 + 15 = -185.
  \]

- At \( r = 0 \):
  \[
  -2(0)^3 + 2(0)^2 + 3(0) = 0.
  \]

Thus, the integral evaluates to:

\[
\int_0^5 \left(-6r^2 + 4r + 3\right) \, dr = -185 - 0 = -185.
\]

The potential difference is then:

\[
\Delta V = -(-185) = +185 \, \text{V}.
\]

From the options provided, the correct answer is **B: 185 V**.
