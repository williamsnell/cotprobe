C: True, True
D: Both are partially false
E: Both are partially true
F: Statement 1 is completely true, Statement 2 is partially false
G: Statement 1 is mostly true, Statement 2 is false
H: Statement 1 is completely false, Statement 2 is partially true
I: True, False
J: Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is mostly true

Alright, let me try to work through this question step by step. So, the question has two statements, and I need to evaluate whether each is true or false, then pick the correct option from A to J.

First, let's look at Statement 1: "RoBERTa pretrains on a corpus that is approximately 10x larger than the corpus BERT pretrained on." I remember that BERT was trained on the BookCorpus and Wikipedia. RoBERTa, which came after BERT, was supposed to have a more extensive training process. From what I recall, RoBERTa used a much larger dataset, but was it 10 times larger? I think BERT's dataset was around 16 GB (like 40 GB when considering the larger BERT model), and RoBERTa used something like 160 GB, which is 10 times more. So Statement 1 sounds true to me.

Now, Statement 2: "ResNeXts in 2018 usually used tanh activation functions." Hmm, I'm not so sure about this. I know that ResNet used ReLU activations. ResNeXt was introduced as an extension of ResNet, focusing on increasing the cardinality (number of parallel branches) rather than depth. So, I think ResNeXt would have followed the same activation functions as ResNet, which is ReLU, not tanh. Tanh is less commonly used in recent models compared to ReLU or its variants. So Statement 2 is probably false.

Putting it together, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false. Looking at the options, option I says "True, False." So I should choose I.

The correct answer is based on evaluating each statement. Statement 1 is true because RoBERTa's training corpus is about 10x larger than BERT's. Statement 2 is false as ResNeXt uses ReLU, not tanh.
