Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to find the mole fraction of CO2 in the exhaust mixture. Hmm, mole fraction, right. I remember that mole fraction is the number of moles of a particular substance divided by the total moles in the mixture. So, I'll need to calculate the moles of each compound and then find the total to get the fraction for CO2.

Let me look at the data given. The compounds are H2O, CO2, CO, and NO. Each has their molecular weight and mass in grams. The masses are pretty big, like 8e7 grams for water. Wait, 8.0 × 10^7 grams, that's 80 million grams. Oh wait, that's a lot, but maybe it's for an hour of flight from a supersonic transport, so emissions are high.

So for each substance, I can calculate moles by dividing the mass by the molecular weight. Moles = mass (g) / molar mass (g/mol).

Let me write down the data:

H2O: molecular weight = 18 g/mol, mass = 8.0e7 g
CO2: MW=44, mass=6.6e7
CO: MW=28, mass=3.6e6
NO: MW=30, mass=3.6e6

Wait, I should double-check the exponents. Oh right, 8.0 ×10^7 is 80,000,000 grams, same as 8e7.

Calculating moles for each:

H2O: moles = 8e7 / 18. Let me compute that. 8e7 divided by 18. 8e7 is 80,000,000. Divided by 18 is approximately 4,444,444.444 moles.

Wait, let me compute 8e7 /18. Let me think: 8e7 is 8 *1e7, so 8e7 = 80,000,000. 80,000,000 /18 = ?

Well, 18 * 4.444444e6 is 80,000,000. Because 4.444444e6 *18= 80,000,000. So H2O is approximately 4.444e6 moles.

CO2: 6.6e7 grams /44 g/mol. 6.6e7 is 66,000,000. 66,000,000 /44 = 1,500,000 moles. Because 44 * 1.5e6 = 66e6. So CO2 is 1.5e6 moles.

CO: 3.6e6 grams /28 g/mol. 3.6e6 is 3,600,000. Divided by 28. Let me calculate that. 3,600,000 /28 = 128,571.42857 moles. So approximately 1.2857e5.

NO: 3.6e6 grams /30 g/mol. 3,600,000 /30 is 120,000 moles.

Now, let me sum all the moles to get the total.

H2O: ~4.444e6
CO2: 1.5e6
CO: ~0.12857e6 (wait, 1.2857e5 is 0.12857e6)
NO: 0.12e6 (120,000 is 0.12e6)

Adding them up:

4.444e6 + 1.5e6 = 5.944e6

Then adding CO and NO: 0.12857e6 + 0.12e6 = 0.24857e6.

So total moles = 5.944e6 + 0.24857e6 = 6.19257e6 moles.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me recalculate the sum more accurately.

H2O: 4,444,444.444 (approx 4.444444e6)
CO2: 1,500,000 (1.5e6)
CO: 128,571.42857 (~0.128571e6)
NO: 120,000 (0.12e6)

Total = 4,444,444.444 + 1,500,000 = 5,944,444.444

Then add 128,571.42857 + 120,000 = 248,571.42857

So total moles = 5,944,444.444 + 248,571.42857 = 6,192,  015.872 approximately? Wait, 5,944,444.444 + 248,571.42857 = 6,192, 015.872? Wait no, 5,944,444.444 is 5,944,444.444, adding 248,571.42857 gives 6,192, 015.872.

Wait, 5,944,444.444 plus 248,571.42857 equals 6,192, 015.872? Let me compute:

5,944,444.444 + 200,000 = 6,144,444.444

Then add 48,571.42857: 6,144,444.444 +48,571.42857 = 6,193,015.872.

So total moles is approximately 6,193,015.872.

Wait, but maybe I should carry more precise numbers.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute each in terms of 1e6:

H2O: 4.444444e6
CO2: 1.5e6
CO: 0.128571e6
NO: 0.12e6

Adding these: 4.444444 + 1.5 + 0.128571 + 0.12 = let's add the numbers.

4.444444 + 1.5 = 5.944444

0.128571 +0.12 = 0.248571

5.944444 + 0.248571 = 6.192915e6 total moles.

So total moles = 6,192,915 moles.

Wait, let me compute 4.444444e6 + 1.5e6 = 5.944444e6.

Then 0.128571e6 is 128571, and 0.12e6 is 120,000. Adding 128571 + 120,000 = 248,571, which is 0.248571e6.

So total is 5.944444e6 + 0.248571e6 =6.192915e6 moles.

So total moles n_total = 6,192,915 approximately.

Now, the moles of CO2 is 1,500,000.

So mole fraction of CO2 is n_CO2 / n_total = 1,500,000 / 6,192,915.

Let me compute that division.

1,500,000 ÷ 6,192,915 ≈ 0.2423 approximately.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

So 1.5e6 /6.192915e6 = 1.5 /6.192915.

Let me compute 1.5 /6.192915.

6.192915 goes into 1.5 how many times?

6.192915 * 0.24 = ?

0.24 *6 = 1.44, 0.24 *0.192915= approx 0.04629. So 1.44 +0.04629=1.48629. So 0.24 times 6.192915 is approx 1.486, which is close to 1.5.

Wait, let me compute 6.192915 * 0.2423.

6 *0.2423=1.4538

0.192915 *0.2423 = approximately 0.04676.

Adding: 1.4538 +0.04676=1.50056.

So 6.192915 * 0.2423 = approx 1.50056, which is just over 1.5.

So 1.5 /6.192915 is approximately 0.2423, which is 24.23%.

Looking at the options, option H is 0.24, J is 0.25.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me do the exact division.

n_CO2 =1,500,000

n_total=6,192,915

So 1,500,000 /6,192,915 = ?

Let me compute this.

Divide numerator and denominator by 5: 300,000 /1,238,583.

Hmm, but that doesn't help much.

Alternatively, approximate:

6,192,915 x 0.24 = 1,486,  let me see.

0.24 *6,192,915.

6,192,915 *0.2=1,238,583.

6,192,915 *0.04=247,716.6.

Adding: 1,238,583 + 247,716.6=1,486,299.6.

Which is 1,486,299.6. But our numerator is 1,500,000.

So 0.24 gives us 1,486,300, which is 13,700 less than 1.5e6.

So the difference is 1.5e6 -1.4863e6 =13,700.

So how much more do we need to add to 0.24? Let's say x additional.

So 6,192,915 * x =13,700.

x=13,700 /6,192,915 ≈ 0.002212.

So total is approximately 0.24 +0.002212=0.2422, which is 0.2422, approximately 0.242, which is about 0.242 or 24.2%.

Looking at the options, option H is 0.24, which is 24%, and option J is 0.25 (25%). So 0.242 is closer to 0.24 than to 0.25.

Wait, but let me think—am I sure about the numbers?

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the moles more accurately, because approximations might have thrown me off.

Let me recalculate each mole count precisely:

H2O: 8e7 g /18 g/mol = 80,000,000 / 18 = 4,444,444.444... moles.

CO2: 6.6e7 /44 =66,000,000 /44 =1,500,000.000 moles.

CO:3.6e6 /28 =3,600,000 /28 =128,571.42857 moles.

NO:3.6e6 /30= 3,600,000 /30=120,000.000 moles.

Sum all four:

4,444,444.4444 +1,500,000.0000 =5,944,444.4444

Then 128,571.42857 +120,000.00000=248,571.42857.

Total moles=5,944,444.4444 +248,571.42857=6,192,  015.87297? Wait, 5,944,444.4444 +248,571.42857.

Let me compute that:

5,944,444.4444 +200,000 =6,144,444.4444

Then add 48,571.42857: 6,144,444.4444 +48,571.42857 =6,193,015.87297.

So total moles are 6,193,015.87297.

CO2 moles:1,500,000.

So mole fraction CO2=1,500,000 /6,193,015.873.

Compute that as 1,500,000 ÷6,193,015.873.

So 6,193,015.873 *0.24= let's calculate that.

6,193,015.873 *0.24=?

0.2 *6,193,015.873=1,238,603.1746

0.04 *6,193,015.873=247,720.63492

Total for 0.24:1,238,603.1746 +247,720.63492=1,486,323.8095

But CO2 is 1,500,000, which is 1,500,000 -1,486,323.8095=13,676.1905 higher.

So how much more is needed beyond 0.24?

The difference is 13,676.1905.

We can find how much x beyond 0.24 gives 6,193,015.873 * x =13,676.1905.

So x=13,676.1905 /6,193,015.873 ≈ 0.002207.

So total mole fraction is 0.24 +0.002207≈0.2422, which is 0.2422.

Looking at the options, 0.24 is option H, 0.24 is 0.24, and J is 0.25.

So 0.2422 rounds to 0.24 when rounded to two decimal places. Or if considering significant figures, the given masses are in 1-2 significant figures, so the mole fraction would be 0.24.

Wait, the masses given are:

H2O: 8.0 ×1e7 → 2 sig figs.

CO2:6.6e7 →2 sig figs.

CO:3.6e6 → 2

NO:3.6e6 → 2.

So all have 2 sig figs. Molecular weights are given as exact, I suppose.

So the moles for each would have 2 sig figs, and the total will be based on that. So when we calculate the mole fraction, the result should be reported to two decimal places, but the significant figures would matter.

Wait, but our calculation for CO2 mole fraction is approximately 0.2422, which is 0.2422. But with 2 sig figs, it would be 0.24 (since 0.24 has two sig figs). Alternatively, the options have two decimal places.

Looking back at the options, the choices are in .01 increments. So 0.24 is option H, 0.242 would be closer to 0.24 than to 0.25.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculations. Let me double-check the moles for each component.

Wait, H2O: 8e7 is 80,000,000 g. Divided by 18, which is 4,444,444.444... Correct.

CO2:6.6e7 =66,000,000 /44 =1,500,000 → correct.

CO:3.6e6 /28 =128,571.42857 → correct.

NO:3.6e6 /30 =120,000 → correct.

Total moles: 4,444,444.444 +1,500,000=5,944,444.444 +128,571.42857+120,000= 6,192, 015.87297 → correct.

So CO2 is 1.5e6 /6,192,015.87297 → 1.5e6 /6.192e6 = 0.2422.

Hmm, but looking back, perhaps I made a calculation mistake earlier. Because 6,192,015.87 is approximately 6.192e6, and 1.5e6 is 1,500,000.

Wait, 1,500,000 divided by 6,192,015.87 → that's 0.2422.

So approximately 24.22% mole fraction.

Looking at the options, the closest is 0.24 (option H) and 0.242 is about 0.24 when rounded to two decimal places. So the answer should be H:0.24.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should check the exact calculation.

Let me compute 1,500,000 ÷6,192,015.87.

Let me write it as 1,500,000 ÷6,192,015.87.

Let me compute this division.

Let me compute 1,500,000 ÷6,192,015.87.

We can write both numbers in millions to simplify:

1.5 /6.19201587.

Compute 1.5 ÷6.19201587.

6.192 *0.24 =1.486 as before.

So 1.5 is 1.5/6.192= approx 0.242.

So yes, 0.242, which is 0.24 when rounded to two decimal places.

So the correct option is H:0.24.

To determine the mole fraction of CO₂ in the exhaust mixture, we first calculate the moles of each compound using the formula:

\[
\text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass (g)}}{\text{Molecular Weight (g/mol)}}
\]

### Given Data:
- **H₂O**: Molecular weight = 18 g/mol, Mass = \(8.0 \times 10^7\) g  
  \[
  \text{Moles of H₂O} = \frac{8.0 \times 10^7}{18} \approx 4,444,444.44 \, \text{moles}
  \]

- **CO₂**: Molecular weight = 44 g/mol, Mass = \(6.6 \times 10^7\) g  
  \[
  \text{Moles of CO₂} = \frac{6.6 \times 10^7}{44} = 1,500,000 \, \text{moles}
  \]

- **CO**: Molecular weight = 28 g/mol, Mass = \(3.6 \times 10^6\) g  
  \[
  \text{Moles of CO} = \frac{3.6 \times 10^6}{28} \approx 128,571.43 \, \text{moles}
  \]

- **NO**: Molecular weight = 30 g/mol, Mass = \(3.6 \times 10^6\) g  
  \[
  \text{Moles of NO} = \frac{3.6 \times 10^6}{30} = 120,000 \, \text{moles}
  \]

### Total Moles in the Mixture:
\[
\text{Total Moles} = 4,444,444.44 + 1,500,000 + 128
