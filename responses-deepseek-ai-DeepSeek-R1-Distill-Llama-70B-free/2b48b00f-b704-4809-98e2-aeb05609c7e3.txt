Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the impedance of a lossless medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem states that the medium has a relative permittivity (epsilon_r) of 10 and a relative permeability (mu_r) of 5. I need to find the impedance. Oh right, impedance in such materials is different from free space, so I can't just assume it's the same as the impedance of free space, which I remember is about 377 ohms.

Wait, so impedance in a medium is calculated using the formula Z = Z0 * sqrt(mu_r / epsilon_r), where Z0 is the impedance of free space. Oh wait, or is it the other way around? No, no, I think it's Z = Z0 multiplied by the square root of (mu_r divided by epsilon_r). Because impedance depends on both permittivity and permeability.

Z0 is the impedance of free space, which is approximately 377 ohms. So plugging in the values here: mu_r is 5 and epsilon_r is 10. So the square root part would be sqrt(5/10), which simplifies to sqrt(0.5). Let me compute that. The square root of 0.5 is about 0.7071.

So then Z is 377 ohms multiplied by 0.7071. Let me do that multiplication. 377 * 0.7 is 263.9, and 377 * 0.0071 is approximately 2.68. Adding those together gives around 266.58 ohms. Hmm, that's approximately 266.6 ohms.

Looking at the options, option E is 266 ohms. That's really close. So I think the correct answer should be E.

Wait, let me double-check the formula. Oh, yeah, the characteristic impedance Z of a medium is given by Z = (sqrt(mu/epsilon))/(sqrt(mu0/epsilon0)) ) * Z0, but since mu = mu_r * mu_0 and epsilon = epsilon_r * epsilon_0, substituting those in gives Z = sqrt(mu_r/mu_0 * epsilon_r/epsilon_0) )^{-1/2} Z0, which simplifies to sqrt(mu_r/epsilon_r) times Z0. Wait, no, wait. Let me rederive it.

Actually, the formula is Z = Z0 * sqrt( (mu_r) / (epsilon_r) ). Because Z0 is sqrt(mu0/epsilon0). So Z would be sqrt(mu_r * mu0 / (epsilon_r * epsilon0)) ) which is sqrt(mu_r/epsilon_r) * sqrt(mu0/epsilon0) = Z0 * sqrt(mu_r/epsilon_r).

No, wait, that's not right. Let me think again. Oh no, I think I got it wrong. The correct formula is Z = (1/ sqrt(epsilon * mu)) * (1 / (1/sqrt(epsilon0 mu0))) ), which would be (sqrt( (mu0 epsilon0) / (mu epsilon) )) ) = sqrt( (mu0 epsilon0)/(mu_r mu0 * epsilon_r epsilon0) )) ) = sqrt(1/(mu_r epsilon_r)) ). Hmm, wait, maybe I'm confusing the steps.

Alternatively, the intrinsic impedance of a medium is given by eta = eta_0 * sqrt( (mu_r) / (epsilon_r) ), where eta_0 is the impedance of free space (around 377 ohms). So this would be eta = 377 * sqrt(5/10) = 377 * sqrt(0.5) ≈ 377 * 0.7071 ≈ 266. So yes, that's correct. So the answer is E.

To determine the impedance of a lossless medium with relative permittivity \(\epsilon_r = 10\) and relative permeability \(\mu_r = 5\), we use the formula for the intrinsic impedance of a medium:

\[
Z = Z_0 \sqrt{\frac{\mu_r}{\epsilon_r}}
\]

Here, \(Z_0\) is the impedance of free space, approximately \(377 \, \Omega\). Substituting the given values:

\[
Z = 377 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{5}{10}} = 377 \cdot \sqrt{0.5}
\]

The square root of \(0.5\) is approximately \(0.7071\). Thus:

\[
Z \approx 377 \cdot 0.7071 \approx 266.6 \, \Omega
\]

Among the provided options, the closest value is \(266 \, \Omega\), which corresponds to option **E**.
