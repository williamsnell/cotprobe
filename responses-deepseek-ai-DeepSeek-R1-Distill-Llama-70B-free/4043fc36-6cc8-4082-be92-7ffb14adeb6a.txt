Question:

Two men agreed to burglarize a home. While they were planning the burglary, the two men learned that the home had a sophisticated alarm system that needed to be disarmed. One of the men told the other that he knew an alarm specialist who could help disarm the security system. One of the men then approached the alarm specialist and asked if he would assist them in disarming the home's alarm system. The alarm specialist said that he didn't want to participate in the crime but told the man how he could disarm the system himself. The two men thereafter went to the home to commit the burglary. When they arrived at the home, they saw a vicious guard dog patrolling the fenced-in area of the home. Deciding it would be too risky to confront the dog, the two men abandoned their planned burglary. Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the criminal liability of the two men and the alarm specialist?

Options:

A: The two men are not guilty of any crime, and the alarm specialist is guilty of conspiracy and attempted burglary.
B: The two men are guilty of attempted burglary, but not conspiracy. The alarm specialist is not guilty of any crime.
C: The two men and the alarm specialist are guilty of both conspiracy and attempted burglary.
D: The two men are guilty of conspiracy and the two men and the alarm specialist are guilty of attempted burglary.
E: The two men and the alarm specialist are guilty of conspiracy.
F: The two men and the alarm specialist are guilty of attempted burglary, but not conspiracy.
G: The two men are not guilty of any crime because they didn't commit the burglary. The alarm specialist is guilty of conspiracy.
H: The two men are guilty of conspiracy and attempted burglary, but the alarm specialist is not guilty of any crime.
I: The alarm specialist is guilty of conspiracy, but the two men are not guilty of any crime because they didn't commit the burglary.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about criminal liability, and I need to figure it out. Let's take it step by step.

The scenario is about two men planning a burglary. They find out the home has a sophisticated alarm system. One man knows an alarm specialist and approaches him for help. The specialist refuses to participate but tells the man how to disarm it himself. Then, the two men go to the home but find a guard dog and decide it's too risky, so they abandon the plan.

The question is about the criminal liability of the two men and the alarm specialist.

First, I need to remember the elements of conspiracy and attempt. Conspiracy requires an agreement between two or more people to commit a crime, with the intent to commit it. Attempt requires taking a substantial step towards the commission of a crime with the intent to commit it.

So, the two men agreed to burglarize the home. That's a clear agreement, so they've formed a conspiracy to commit burglary. So, they're guilty of conspiracy.

Now, did they take a substantial step towards the burglary? They went to the home to commit it but were deterred by the dog. So, going to the location with intent might be a substantial step. But wait, the plan was to commit the burglary, and they were ready but stopped because of the dog. So, does that count as an attempt?

I think that yes, because they were about to commit the burglary but were prevented by circumstances beyond their control. So, attempt applies here because they took a substantial step toward the crime with the intent.

So, the two men are guilty of both conspiracy and attempted burglary.

What about the alarm specialist? He refused to participate but gave them information on how to disarm the system. Does that make him part of the conspiracy? Conspiracy requires an agreement to commit the crime. If he didn't agree to participate, he's not part of the conspiracy. But by giving them information, does that make him an accomplice or a co-conspirator?

Wait, he told them how to do it, but he didn't agree to help them commit the burglary. So, he's not part of the conspiracy. Also, for attempt, he didn't take any steps himself. He just provided information. So, he might not be liable for attempt either.

So, the alarm specialist isn't guilty of any crime because he didn't agree to the conspiracy and didn't take any steps to commit the crime himself.

Now, looking at the options:

Option H says the two men are guilty of conspiracy and attempted burglary, and the specialist isn't guilty. That matches what I thought.

Wait, let me double-check. The two men conspired, so that's conspiracy. They took a substantial step by going to the house, intending to commit burglary, so that's attempt. Specialist didn't conspire, didn't attempt, so no guilt.

So the correct answer should be H.

The two men are guilty of conspiracy because they agreed to commit a burglary. They are also guilty of attempted burglary since they took a substantial step toward the crime by going to the home with the intent to commit it, even though they were deterred by the guard dog. The alarm specialist is not guilty of any crime because he did not agree to participate in the conspiracy and did not take any steps toward committing the crime himself.

Answer: H
