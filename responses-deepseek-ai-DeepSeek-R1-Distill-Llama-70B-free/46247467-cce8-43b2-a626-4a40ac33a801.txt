Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about psychological testing reports and what a psychologist is ethically bound to include. Let me try to break this down.

The question is asking what must be included in such a report. The options are A through I. I remember that ethical considerations in psychological testing are pretty important, so I should think about the guidelines here.

Option A says personal opinions and assumptions about the client. Wait, isn't that unprofessional? I think psychologists are supposed to base their reports on data, not personal opinions. So A is probably not correct.

Option B is the psychologist's preferred treatment plan. Hmm, I'm not sure. I think treatment plans might be included, but are they ethically required? Or is that more of a clinical decision rather than a reporting requirement? Maybe not, because the question is about what's ethically bound to include.

Option C: interpretations of the data and limiting circumstances. Oh right, I remember that psychologists should provide interpretations based on the data. Also, they should discuss the limitations of the testing conditions. Like, if the environment was noisy, or if the test has certain biases. So C sounds correct.

Option D: only results that support the initial hypothesis. No, that doesn't sound right. Selective reporting is unethical because it misrepresents the findings. Reports should include all relevant data, not just supportive ones.

Option E: only positive results. Definitely not. That would be misleading and incomplete. Ethical reports should present a balanced view, including both strengths and areas of concern.

Option F: potential pathology that might develop. I'm not sure. Maybe in some cases, but is it a required part of the report? I don't think it's ethically mandatory unless it's clearly indicated by the data. But the question is about what's bound to be included.

Option G: detailed history of past evaluations. While history is important, I don't think it's the psychologist's duty to include all past evaluations unless relevant. Or maybe that's part of the client's history taken during assessment, but not necessarily in the testing report itself.

Option H: only data with corroborating evidence. That might limit the report too much. Sometimes, especially in psychological testing, not all data points can be corroborated, but they're still valid to report as part of the assessment.

Option I: only data believed relevant. I think this is somewhat correct because reports should focus on relevant findings. But the question is about what's ethically required. While including only relevant data is good practice, the question is more about the specific ethical inclusion, which I think is more about the interpretations and limitations.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be C. It includes the necessary interpretations and addresses the limitations, which are ethical requirements to ensure accuracy and transparency in reporting.

The correct answer is C. When preparing a psychological testing report, a psychologist is ethically bound to include interpretations of the data and any limiting circumstances that could affect the validity or interpretation of the test results. This ensures transparency, accuracy, and accountability in the reporting process.

Answer: C
