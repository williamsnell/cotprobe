Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about psychotherapy approaches. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about culturally sensitive approaches and their perspective. The options are A through J.

Alright, the question says that culturally sensitive approaches try to understand a client's experience within their cultural context. So that means the approach is looking at things from the client's own viewpoint, right? Like, it's about understanding how the client themselves see their situation, not imposing an outside perspective.

Wait, I remember something about emic and etic perspectives from my psychology class. Emic is when you study a culture from the inside, trying to see things as the members of that culture do. Etic is the outside perspective, more like an observer's viewpoint, often using external theories or frameworks.

So in this case, the culturally sensitive approach would take an emic perspective because it's about understanding the client's experience within their own cultural context. That means the answer should be F: emic.

Let me make sure I'm not mixing up the terms. Etic is like the bird's-eye view, generalizing across cultures, while emic is the worm's-eye view, focusing on the specific culture's internal perspective. So yes, the correct answer is F.

The question asks about the perspective adopted by culturally sensitive approaches in psychotherapy, which focus on understanding a client's experience within their own cultural context. This is the emic perspective, which involves viewing the situation from the client's internal, cultural viewpoint. 

Answer: F
