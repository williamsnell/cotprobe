Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully. 

The question says: Five years ago, a computer that worked half as fast as a current computer cost twice as much money. The current computer's speed to price ratio is what percent of the older computer's speed to price ratio?

Hmm, I think I need to compare the speed to price ratios of the current and the older computer. Let's break this down step by step.

First, let's define some variables to make things clearer. Let's say the current computer has a speed S and a price P. So the speed to price ratio for the current computer would be S/P.

Now, five years ago, the computer was half as fast. So its speed was S/2. And it cost twice as much, so its price was 2P. So the speed to price ratio for the older computer would be (S/2)/(2P).

Wait, let me make sure I got that right. The older computer is half as fast as current, so S_old = (1/2) S_current. And the cost was twice as much, so P_old = 2 * P_current.

So the ratio for the old computer is (S_old) / (P_old) = ( (S/2) ) / (2P) ) = (S/(2)) ) * (1/(2P)) ) = S/(4P).

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me compute that again. (S/2) divided by (2P) is (S/2) * (1/(2P)) = S/(4P). So the old ratio is S/(4P).

The current ratio is S/P. So the question is asking, what percent is the current ratio of the old ratio. In other words, (current ratio) / (old ratio) * 100%.

Let me compute that. Current ratio is S/P, old ratio is S/(4P). So (S/P) divided by (S/(4P)) equals (S/P) * (4P/S) ). The S cancels out, and the P cancels out, giving 4. So 4 times 100% is 400%. 

Wait, but that can't be right because looking at the options, 400 is an option (E). So the answer would be E. But let me double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of specific numbers to make it clearer. Let's pick numbers that make the math easy.

Suppose the current computer's speed is 2 units, and its price is $1. So the current ratio is 2/1 = 2.

Five years ago, the computer was half as fast, so 1 unit, and cost twice as much, so $2. So the old ratio is 1/2 = 0.5.

Now, the current ratio is 2, the old is 0.5. So current is (2 / 0.5) = 4 times the old ratio. So 4 times 100% is 400%. Yep, that matches what I got earlier.

So the current computer's speed to price ratio is 400% of the older one. So the correct answer must be E: 400.

To solve the problem, we compare the speed to price ratios of the current and older computers.

1. **Define Variables**:  
   - Let the speed of the current computer be \( S \) and its price be \( P \).  
   - The speed to price ratio of the current computer is \( \frac{S}{P} \).  

2. **Older Computer**:  
   - Five years ago, the computer was half as fast, so its speed was \( \frac{S}{2} \).  
   - It cost twice as much, so its price was \( 2P \).  
   - The speed to price ratio of the older computer is \( \frac{\frac{S}{2}}{2P} = \frac{S}{4P} \).  

3. **Compare Ratios**:  
   - The question asks for the current computer's speed to price ratio as a percentage of the older computer's ratio.  
   - Compute the ratio:  
     \[
     \frac{\text{Current Ratio}}{\text{Old Ratio}} = \frac{\frac{S}{P}}{\frac{S}{4P}} = \frac{S}{P} \cdot \frac{4P}{S} = 4.
     \]  
   - Convert to percentage: \( 4 \times 100\% = 400\% \).  

Thus, the current computer's speed to price ratio is **400%** of the older computer's speed to price ratio.
