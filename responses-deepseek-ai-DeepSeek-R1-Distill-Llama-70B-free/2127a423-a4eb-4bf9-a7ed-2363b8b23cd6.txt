Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics question about Skylar taking a second piece of cake at a birthday party. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question is about marginal benefits and marginal costs. I remember that in economics, when people make decisions, they weigh the marginal benefits (MB) against the marginal costs (MC). The basic idea is that a rational person will keep consuming a good until the marginal benefit of the next unit is equal to the marginal cost. So, if the MB is greater than MC, they'll consume it; if MB is less, they'll stop.

Skylar is having a second piece of cake. So, the first piece must have been worth it to him. Let's say the marginal benefit of the first piece was high, maybe higher than the cost of eating it (like the time, money, or whatever). Now, when he takes the second piece, we have to consider what happens to the marginal benefit. Typically, the law of diminishing marginal utility comes into play here. Each additional unit of a good gives less satisfaction than the previous one. So, the second piece of cake probably gives him less pleasure than the first.

But wait, the question is about whether he actually takes that second piece. If he's taking it, that suggests that the MB of the second piece is still greater than or equal to the MC. Because if the MB was less than MC, he wouldn't take it. So, for him to choose the second piece, the marginal benefit must be at least equal to the marginal cost. Otherwise, it wouldn't be worth it to him.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the MB of the second piece is less than the MC. That would mean he shouldn't take it, but he does. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B says the total benefit is falling. Wait, total benefit is the sum of all marginal benefits. If he eats the first piece, total benefit increases. The second piece adds to total benefit, but maybe less than the first. So total benefit is still rising, just at a diminishing rate. So B might not be correct because total benefit could still be increasing, just not as much per piece.

Option C is the ratio of MB over MC being less than one. If MB/MC <1, that implies MB < MC. So that's the same as option A. If that's the case, he wouldn't eat it. So C is also incorrect.

Option D says the MB is greater than the MC for the second piece. That makes sense because if MB > MC, he would choose to have that second piece. So D must be the right answer.

Wait, but I should double-check. The question says "for this individual, it must be the case that..." So when he takes the second piece, it's because up to that point, each piece's MB was at least equal to MC. So the second piece must have MB >= MC. But the question is phrased as "must be the case", meaning it's definitely true. So the correct statement is that the MB of the second piece is greater than the MC. So D is correct.

I think I've got it. So the answer should be D.

At the birthday party, Skylar decides to take a second piece of cake. In economics, individuals make decisions based on the comparison of marginal benefits (MB) and marginal costs (MC). A rational person continues consuming a good as long as the MB of the next unit is greater than or equal to the MC. If MB > MC, consumption occurs; if MB < MC, consumption stops.

Skylar taking the second piece implies that the MB of the second piece is at least equal to the MC. If the MB were less than the MC, he would not take it. The law of diminishing marginal utility suggests that the second piece likely provides less satisfaction than the first, but it still meets or exceeds the MC for him to choose it.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. If the MB of the second piece were less than the MC, Skylar would not take it.
- **B**: Incorrect. Total benefit may increase with the second piece, even if at a diminishing rate.
- **C**: Incorrect. A ratio of MB/MC < 1 implies MB < MC, which would mean he wouldnâ€™t take the second piece.
- **D**: Correct. For Skylar to take the second piece, the MB must be greater than the MC.

Thus, the correct answer is:

D
