Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about the fractional increase of mass for a 600-mi/hr jetliner. Hmm, I remember from my classes that when objects move at high speeds, their mass increases according to Einstein's theory of relativity. So, the formula must be related to special relativity.

Wait, right, the formula for relativistic mass increase is Δm/m = (γ - 1), where γ is the Lorentz factor. And γ is equal to 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So, γ = 1/√(1 - v²/c²). That makes sense because as v approaches the speed of light, γ increases a lot, leading to a significant increase in mass.

But wait, the jetliner's speed is given in miles per hour. I need to convert that into meters per second because the speed of light is in meters per second. Let's see, 600 miles per hour. Oh, right, 1 mile is approximately 1609 meters, and 1 hour is 3600 seconds. So, 600 miles is 600 * 1609 meters, which is 965,400 meters. Then per hour, so divide by 3600 seconds. Let me calculate that.

600 mi/hr = 600 * 1609 m / 3600 s. Let me compute that: 600 divided by 3600 is 1/6. So 600 * 1609 = 965,400, divided by 3600 gives me 965400 / 3600. Let me compute that. Well, 3600 goes into 965400 how many times? Let me see, 3600 * 268 = 964,800, and 268 times 3600 is 964,800. So 965,400 minus 964,800 is 600. So that's 268 and 600/3600, which simplifies to 268.166... So approximately 268.1667 m/s. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 600 mi/hr is about 268 m/s? No, wait, that's way too high because I think 1 mi/hr is about 0.447 m/s. Oh wait, I think I messed up the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, 1 mile is 1609.34 meters. So 600 miles is 600 * 1609.34 ≈ 965,400 meters. Now, per hour, so 965400 meters per 3600 seconds. So 965400 / 3600 = let's divide 965400 by 3600. 3600 * 268 = 964800, as I had before. So 268 * 3600 = 964800. So 965400 - 964800 is 600. So 600/3600 = 1/6 ≈ 0.1667. So the speed is approximately 268.1667 m/s. Wait, that seems high for a jetliner. Wait, no, actually, 600 mi/hr is about 965 km/h, which is roughly the speed of a commercial jetliner. So that seems correct.

Now, the speed of light is about 3 x 10^8 m/s. So, v is 268.1667 m/s, and c is 3e8 m/s. So, v/c would be 268.1667 / 3e8. Let me compute that. 3e8 is 300,000,000. So 268.1667 divided by 300,000,000. Let's see, 268 / 3e8 would be approximately 0.000000894. Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

268.1667 ÷ 300,000,000 = 0.00000089422. So v/c ≈ 8.9422e-7. Now, v squared over c squared would be (8.9422e-7)^2. Let's compute that. (8.94e-7)^2 is approximately 8e-13. Let's compute it accurately: 8.9422e-7 squared is (8.9422)^2 = about 80, so 80e-14, which is 8e-13. So, v²/c² ≈ 8e-13.

Wait, but let me be precise. (8.9422e-7)^2 = (approx) (8.94)^2 * 1e-14. 8.94 squared is around 80 (since 9 squared is 81), so about 79.8. So 79.8e-14, which is 7.98e-13. So v²/c² ≈ 7.98e-13.

Now, the denominator in the Lorentz factor is sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But since v²/c² is so small, we can approximate using a binomial expansion. Because when x is very small, sqrt(1 - x) ≈ 1 - x/2. So, 1/sqrt(1 - x) ≈ 1 + x/2. Therefore, γ ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2c²). Because for small x, 1/(sqrt(1-x)) ≈ 1 + (1/2)x. So, the fractional increase in mass, which is γ -1, would be approximately (v²)/(2c²).

So, Δm/m ≈ v²/(2c²). Plugging in the numbers, we have v²/c² ≈ 7.98e-13. So, dividing by 2 gives Δm/m ≈ 3.99e-13. So approximately 4e-13.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. Because I might have miscalculated v²/c². Let me compute (268.1667)^2 = 268.1667 * 268.1667. Let's compute that: 268^2 is 71,824. 0.1667^2 is about 0.0278. The cross terms are 2*268*0.1667 ≈ 2*268*0.1667 ≈ 2*44.69 ≈ 89.38. So total is 71,824 + 89.38 + 0.0278 ≈ 71,913.4078. So v² is about 71,913.4 m²/s².

c² is (3e8)^2 = 9e16 m²/s². So v²/c² = 71,913.4 / 9e16 = approximately 7.99e-13. So that's correct.

So, using the approximation Δm/m ≈ v²/(2c²) = 7.99e-13 / 2 ≈ 3.995e-13. So approximately 4.0e-13.

Looking at the options, the closest one is option C: 4.5 × 10^-12. Wait, wait, no, wait. Because 4.0e-13 is 4.0 × 10^-13, which is 0.4 ×10^-12. But looking at the options, the options given are in the 1e-12 range.

Wait, that can't be. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, wait, let's compute v more accurately. Let me go back. 600 mi/hr to m/s. 1 mile is 1609.344 meters, so 600 miles is 600 * 1609.344 = let me compute that.

600 * 1600 = 960,000. 600 *9.344 = 5,606.4. So total is 965,606.4 meters. Now, per hour, which is 3600 seconds. So 965,606.4 / 3600 = let's compute that. 965606.4 ÷ 3600.

Let me compute 965606.4 ÷ 3600. 3600 * 268 = 964,800. So 268 * 3600 = 964,800. Subtract that from 965,606.4, we get 806.4. So 806.4 / 3600 = 0.224. So total is 268.224 m/s. Hmm, that's a bit more precise. So v = 268.224 m/s.

Now, v² = (268.224)^2. Let me compute that accurately. 268^2 = 71,824. 0.224^2 is about 0.050176. The cross term is 2*268*0.224 = 2*268 = 536, times 0.224 is approximately 536 * 0.2 = 107.2, and 536 * 0.024 = around 12.864. So total cross term is approx 120.064. So total v^2 = 71,824 + 120.064 + 0.050176 ≈ 71,944.114 m²/s².

c^2 is 9e16 m²/s². So v²/c² = 71,944.114 / 9e16. Let me compute this as 71,944.114 ÷ 9 = approx 7982.68, so 7982.68e-16, which is 7.98268e-13.

So, v²/c² ≈ 7.98268e-13. Then, the fractional mass increase is (v²)/(2c²) = 7.98268e-13 / 2 ≈ 3.9913e-13, which is approximately 4.0e-13.

Hmm, looking at the options, the options are in the 1e-12 range. So 4e-13 is 0.4e-12. But none of the options match that. Let me look again. The options given are:

A: 1.0e-12

B: 1.5e-12

C:4.5e-12

D:3.0e-12

E:5.0e-12

F:2.5e-12

G:3.5e-12

H:0.75e-12

I:0.5e-12

J:6.0e-12

Wait, none of them are 4.0e-13. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Or maybe I should compute the exact value without approximation.

Wait, because when v is small, using the approximation is okay, but maybe I should compute the exact γ -1.

So, the exact formula is γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, γ -1 = [1/sqrt(1 - x)] -1, where x = v²/c². For small x, this is approximately x/2 + (3/8)x² + ... So, maybe the next term in the expansion is needed.

So, let's compute γ -1 more accurately. Since x is 7.98e-13, which is very small, but let's compute it exactly.

Compute 1/sqrt(1 - x) -1. Since x is very small, the approximation x/2 + (3/8)x² would be better.

So, x = 7.98e-13. So, x/2 = 3.99e-13. (3/8)x² = (3/8)*(7.98e-13)^2. Let's compute that.

(7.98e-13)^2 = approx 6.38e-25. Multiply by 3/8: 6.38e-25 * 0.375 ≈ 2.39e-25. So, the second term is 2.39e-25. So, when you add x/2 and (3/8)x², it's 3.99e-13 + 2.39e-25 ≈ 4.00024e-13. So, the exact value is only slightly larger than the first approximation. So negligible difference.

So, Δm/m is approximately 4.0e-13, which is 4.0 × 10^-13, or 0.4 ×10^-12.

Wait, but all the options are in the 1e-12 range. That's a problem. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating v.

Wait, wait, let me check the initial conversion again. 600 mi/hr to m/s. Oh wait, 1 mi/hr is 0.44704 m/s. So 600 mi/hr is 600 * 0.44704 = ?

600 * 0.4 = 240, 600 * 0.04704 = let's compute 0.04704 *600=28.224. So total is 240 + 28.224 = 268.224 m/s. So that's correct.

Hmm, then the calculation is correct, leading to Δm/m ≈ 4.0e-13, which is 4.0 ×10^-13. But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the question has a typo, or maybe I'm missing a factor.

Wait, wait, let's compute the exact value without approximation. Let's compute sqrt(1 - x), where x is 7.98e-13.

So, 1 - x = 0.99999999992002. The square root of that is approximately 0.99999999996. So, 1/sqrt(1 -x) is 1.00000000004. So, subtracting 1, we get 4.0e-11? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, let me compute it correctly.

Wait, the square root of (1 - x) when x is small is 1 - x/2 - x²/8. So, 1 - x ≈ e^(-x/2 - x²/8). So, 1/sqrt(1 -x) is approximately 1 + x/2 + (3x²)/8. So, the exact value would be γ ≈ 1 + x/2 + (3x²)/8. So, γ -1 is x/2 + 3x²/8.

So with x = 7.98e-13, x/2 is 3.99e-13, and 3x²/8 is about 3*(7.98e-13)^2 /8 ≈ 3*(6.38e-25)/8 ≈ 2.39e-25. So, negligible compared to 3.99e-13. So, the total is still about 4.0e-13.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately using the exact formula. So, let's compute 1/(sqrt(1 - x)) -1, where x is 7.9827e-13.

Compute 1/(sqrt(1 - x)) = 1 + (1/2)x + (3/8)x² + (5/16)x^3 + ... So, up to x squared.

So, x = 7.9827e-13. x squared is x^2 = (7.98e-13)^2 ≈ 6.38e-25. So, (3/8)x² ≈ 2.39e-25.

So, γ-1 ≈ (x/2) + (3/8)x² ≈ 3.99e-13 + 2.39e-25 ≈ 4.00e-13. So, the fractional increase is approximately 4.0e-13, which is 4.0 ×10^-13.

But looking at the options, the closest is option C:4.5e-12, which is ten times larger. Hmm, this is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of x.

Wait, wait, let me recheck the calculation of v. Wait, 600 mi/hr is 600 * 1609.344 m / 3600 s. So 600/3600 = 1/6. So 1609.344 * (1/6) = 1609.344 /6 ≈ 268.224 m/s. Yes, correct.

v^2 = (268.224)^2 = let me compute it accurately. 268^2 is 71,824. 0.224^2 is 0.050176. The cross term is 2 * 268 * 0.224 = 2 * 268 = 536 * 0.224 = let's compute 536 * 0.2 = 107.2, 536 * 0.024 = 12.864. So, total cross term is 107.2 +12.864 = 120.064. So, v^2 = 71,824 + 120.064 + 0.050176 ≈ 71,944.114176 m²/s².

c is 3e8 m/s, so c^2 is 9e16 m²/s². So, x = v²/c² = 71,944.114176 / 9e16 = 71,944.114176 ÷ 9 = approximately 7982.6791e-16 → 7.9826791e-13.

So x is 7.9826791e-13. Then, x/2 is 3.99133955e-13. So, about 3.99e-13.

So the fractional increase is 3.99e-13, or 4.0e-13.

But the options don't have 4.0e-13. The options are in the 1e-12 range. So perhaps the question was intended to be 600 mi/hr, but perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion somewhere.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should have used miles per second instead of meters per second? No, that doesn't make sense. The speed of light is in meters per second, so I must convert to m/s.

Wait, another angle: Perhaps the question is asking for the mass increase factor as (γ -1), but perhaps I should compute it more accurately without the approximation.

Let me compute 1/sqrt(1 - x) -1 where x = 7.9827e-13.

So, 1 - x = 0.999999999920023. The square root of that is approximately 0.99999999996. So 1/0.99999999996 is approximately 1.00000000004. So, γ = 1.00000000004, so γ -1 is approximately 4.0e-11? Wait, no, that can't be right because 0.99999999996 is 1 - 4e-11. Wait, perhaps I'm
