Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about garden peas. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my Hardy-Weinberg stuff, but let's see if I can work through this.

Alright, the question says that in a population of garden peas, the genes F (full pods) and f (constricted) are segregating. The frequencies are p = 0.7 for F and q = 0.3 for f. The population is in genetic equilibrium, which I think means Hardy-Weinberg applies here.

The question is asking about the proportion of constricted-podded progeny when you mate full-podded × full-podded plants. So we're looking for the probability that their offspring will have constricted pods, which I believe is the ff phenotype.

Wait, wait, but wait. In a typical monohybrid cross, like a test cross or something else, but here the parents are both full-podded. So what's their genotype? Full-podded could be either FF or Ff. Oh right, because F is dominant, I assume. So only ff would show the recessive trait, constricted pods.

But wait, the parents are both full-podded, so their genotypes must be either FF or Ff. But what's the genotype distribution in the population? Oh, right, since the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the genotype frequencies are p², 2pq, q² for FF, Ff, ff respectively.

So for the full-podded plants, their genotypes could be either FF or Ff. What's the proportion of each? Let me calculate that. The frequency of FF is p² = (0.7)^2 = 0.49. The frequency of Ff is 2pq = 2*(0.7)*(0.3) = 0.42. So in the population, 49% are FF and 42% are Ff among the full-podded plants. But wait, the question is about mating full-podded × full-podded. So the parents are all the full-podded individuals, which include both FF and Ff.

Wait, no, wait. No, wait a second. The problem is about matings between full-podded × full-podded parents. So all the parents in this cross are phenotypically full-podded. So what's the genotype distribution of these parents?

Right, so the frequency of FF in the population is p² = 0.49, and Ff is 2pq = 0.42. Wait, no, wait: The total for full-podded is p² + 2pq, which is 0.49 + 0.42 = 0.91. But wait, I think I'm confusing something. Oh wait, no, the full-podded includes both FF and Ff. So in the population, any full-podded plant is either FF or Ff. So when you select for full-podded plants to mate, their genotypes are FF and Ff in the proportions of 0.49 and 0.42, respectively.

But wait, wait no, I think I'm getting this wrong. The genotype frequencies for the entire population are p² (FF) = 0.49, 2pq (Ff) = 0.42, and q² (ff) = 0.09. So in the entire population, 49% are FF, 42% Ff, and 9% ff. But the question is about matings between full-podded plants, which are the FF and Ff individuals. So the proportion of FF among full-podded is 0.49 / (0.49 + 0.42) = 0.49 / 0.91 ≈ 0.538. And Ff would be 0.42 / 0.91 ≈ 0.462. So when we have a mating between two full-podded plants, each parent could be FF or Ff with those probabilities.

Wait no, but maybe a simpler approach. Since the population is in HWE, the parents are chosen at random from the population, but here they're selecting only full-podded (so either FF or Ff). So each parent could be FF or Ff. So when they mate, the cross could be FF × FF, FF × Ff, or Ff × Ff. Wait, but in a selfing or random mating, each parent would contribute a gamete. But perhaps the way to think about it is that each parent produces gametes, and the progeny's genotype is based on the combination.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model this as a cross between two full-podded parents, each of which can be either FF or Ff. So we need to find the expected proportion of ff progeny when two full-podded parents are mated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the parents as being randomly selected from the full-podded population. So each parent's genotype is determined by the frequencies in the full-podded group.

Wait, but maybe the problem is simpler. Since the population is in HWE, the allele frequencies are at equilibrium, so when two full-podded plants are crossed, what's the probability their offspring is ff.

Wait, perhaps each full-podded parent can produce F or f gametes. The probability that a full-podded plant produces an F gamete is (prob it's FF * 1) + (prob it's Ff * 0.5). Similarly for f gametes.

Wait, let me think. For a full-podded plant, the probability it's FF is 0.49, and Ff is 0.42. So the chance that a plant is FF is 0.49/(0.49+0.42) = 0.49/0.91 ≈ 0.538. Similarly, the chance it's Ff is 0.42/0.91 ≈ 0.462.

So for each parent, the probability of passing on an F allele is:

If the parent is FF: 100% F gametes.

If the parent is Ff: 50% F and 50% f.

So for one parent, the probability of passing F is (0.538 * 1) + (0.462 * 0.5) = 0.538 + 0.231 = 0.769.

Similarly, the probability of passing f is (0.538 * 0) + (0.462 * 0.5) = 0 + 0.231 = 0.231.

Wait, so each parent has a 0.231 chance of contributing an f gamete. So the chance that both parents contribute f gametes is 0.231 * 0.231 = 0.0535, approximately 0.0532, which is option G.

Wait, but wait. Let me recalculate that. Let's compute it more accurately.

The proportion of FF in the full-podded population is 0.49/(0.49 + 0.42) = 0.49 / 0.91 = approximately 0.538. So 53.8% are FF, 46.2% are Ff.

So the probability that a parent will contribute an f gamete is:

Probability parent is Ff * 0.5 + probability parent is ff * 1.

Wait, but wait, the parents are full-podded, so they can't be ff. So the only way a parent can contribute an f gamete is if they're Ff, and produce an f gamete. So the probability is (probability parent is Ff) * 0.5.

So, the probability a parent contributes f is (0.42/0.91) * 0.5 = (0.462) * 0.5 ≈ 0.231.

So for each parent, the chance of passing an f is 0.231. Since the two parents are independent, the chance that both pass f is (0.231)^2 ≈ 0.0534, which is approximately 0.0532 or 0.053. Looking at the options, option G is 0.0532, so that's probably the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a quicker way. Since the population is in HWE, the frequency of f is 0.3. But when parents are selected as full-podded, the frequency of f in their gametes would be different.

Wait, another approach: in the population, the frequency of F is 0.7, f is 0.3. But when you select only full-podded plants, which are FF and Ff.

The allele frequency of F in the full-podded group is: each FF individual contributes 2 F alleles, each Ff contributes 1 F and 1 f.

So total F alleles in full-podded group: 2*(number of FF) + 1*(number of Ff).

Number of FF is p² = 0.49, Ff is 2pq = 0.42.

So total F alleles: 2*0.49 + 0.42 = 0.98 + 0.42 = 1.4.

Total alleles in full-podded group: 2*(0.49 + 0.42) = 2*(0.91) = 1.82.

So the frequency of F in gametes from full-podded plants is 1.4 / 1.82 ≈ 0.769, and f is (1.82 - 1.4)/1.82 = 0.42/1.82 ≈ 0.231, same as before.

So the frequency of f gametes is 0.231 from each parent. So the chance that both parents pass f is (0.231)^2 ≈ 0.0533.

Looking at the options, option G is 0.0532. So that's the answer.

To determine the proportion of constricted-podded (ff) progeny from matings of full-podded × full-podded plants, we use the Hardy-Weinberg principle. The allele frequencies are given as \( p = 0.7 \) (frequency of F) and \( q = 0.3 \) (frequency of f). The genotype frequencies in the population are:

- \( FF: p^2 = 0.49 \)
- \( Ff: 2pq = 0.42 \)
- \( ff: q^2 = 0.09 \)

Since only full-podded plants (FF and Ff) are mated, we calculate their proportions among full-podded individuals. The total proportion of full-podded plants is \( p^2 + 2pq = 0.49 + 0.42 = 0.91 \). Thus, the proportions of FF and Ff among full-podded plants are:

- \( FF: \frac{0.49}{0.91} \approx 0.538 \)
- \( Ff: \frac{0.42}{0.91} \approx 0.462 \)

Next, we calculate the probability of producing an f gamete from a full-podded parent. An FF parent always produces F gametes, while an Ff parent produces f gametes with a probability of \( 0.5 \). The overall probability of producing an f gamete is:

\[
P(f) = \text{(Proportion of FF parents × 0)} + \text{(Proportion of Ff parents × 0.5)} = (0.538 \times 0) + (0.462 \times 0.5) \approx 0.231
\]

The probability that both parents contribute an f gamete, resulting in an ff offspring, is:

\[
P(ff) = P(f) \times P(f) = 0.231 \times 0.231 \approx 0.0533
\]

This value matches option G (\( 0.0532 \)), which is the closest approximation.
