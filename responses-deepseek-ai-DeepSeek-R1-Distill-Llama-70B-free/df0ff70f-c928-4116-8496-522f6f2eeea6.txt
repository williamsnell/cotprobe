Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about capillary action and surface tension. Hmm, I remember that capillary rise has something to do with the height a liquid rises in a narrow tube. The formula comes to mind, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think.

The question says the surface tension of water is 72.62 dyn/cm at 20°C. The capillary has a diameter of 1.0 mm. I need to find how high the water rises. The options are from A to J, so I'll have to calculate and match.

Wait, the formula for capillary rise is h = (2γ cosθ) / (ρ g r), right? Or was it something else? I think that's the one. Oh wait, but sometimes I've seen it written with density and gravity. Let me make sure.

So, the variables here are surface tension γ, contact angle θ, density ρ, gravitational acceleration g, and radius r of the tube. Oh, right, and for water, the contact angle with glass is usually taken as zero because it wets the glass. So cosθ would be 1 in this case.

So substituting the values. Let me jot down the knowns:

γ = 72.62 dyn/cm. Wait, dynes and centimeters. I should convert the units to meters and kilograms, or maybe keep everything in CGS units since the answer is in cm.

Wait, the radius is 1.0 mm in diameter, so diameter is 1 mm, radius is 0.5 mm. Oh wait, 1 mm is 0.1 cm, so radius is 0.05 cm.

Wait, let me get all the units straight. Let me see. Surface tension is in dyn/cm, which I think is equivalent to erg/cm², but perhaps I don't need to worry about that if I'm consistent with units.

Alternatively, using CGS units throughout might make this easier. So let's see.

So the formula is h = (2 * γ * cosθ) / (ρ * g * r)

Given that θ is 0, cosθ is 1.

So plugging in the numbers:

γ = 72.62 dyn/cm → which is 72.62 dynes/cm.

The density of water, ρ, is 1 gram per cm³, right? Because 1 g/cm³ is the density of water.

Gravity, g, is 980 cm/s². I remember that's the standard value in CGS units.

So putting it all in:

h = (2 * 72.62) / (1 * 980 * 0.05) 

Wait, because r is 0.05 cm.

Wait, let me compute the denominator first. 1 * 980 = 980, multiplied by 0.05 gives 49. So denominator is 49.

Numerator is 2 *72.62 = 145.24.

So h = 145.24 / 49 = let's do that division.

49 into 145.24. Well, 49 * 2 =98, subtract from 145, 47 left. Bring down the 2: 472. 49 *9=441, so 9, remainder 31. Bring down the 4: 314. 49*6=294, so 6, remainder 20. So approximately 2.96 cm? Wait, wait, let me recalculate.

Wait 49 into 145.24.

49 * 2 = 98. Subtract from 145, we have 47 left. 47.24.

Now, 49 * 0.96 is 47.04. So 2.96? Because 2 + 0.96 = 2.96. So h is approximately 2.96 cm. But wait, looking at the options, option G is 2.96 cm. Oh, but wait, I thought the capillary rise might be higher. Because I remember in some examples, like with a 1 mm tube, the rise is a few centimeters.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I get the formula right? Because I've also seen the formula written as h = (4γ cosθ)/(ρ g d), where d is the diameter. Because sometimes it's expressed in terms of diameter instead of radius.

Wait, let me double-check.

The formula can be written in terms of diameter as h = (4γ cosθ)/(ρ g d), since r is d/2, so 2γ/(r (other terms)) becomes 4γ/(d ...).

So if I use diameter d = 1 mm = 0.1 cm, then the formula becomes:

h = (4 * 72.62 * 1) / (1 * 980 * 0.1)

Wait, let's compute.

4 *72.62 = 290.48.

Denominator: 1 * 980 * 0.1 = 98.

So h = 290.48 / 98 ≈ 2.96 cm. Same result as before. So option G is 2.96 cm.

But wait, some of the options are higher. Option I is 7.44 cm, which is about 2.96 times 2.5. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, I think I might have mixed up the formula. Let me think again. Another way to remember the formula: the height is given by the balance between the surface tension force and the weight of the column of water.

The surface tension force is 2πr γ (since it's the circumference times the surface tension), but wait, no. The force from surface tension is the surface tension (γ) times the length (which is the circumference, 2πr) but wait, no. Wait, surface tension is force per unit length, so the force would be γ multiplied by the circumference, which is 2πr. So F = 2πr γ.

This force is balanced by the weight of the water column, which is the volume times density times gravity: Volume is π r² h, density is ρ, so weight is π r² h ρ g.

So setting them equal: 2π r γ = π r² h ρ g → solving for h gives h = (2 γ) / (r ρ g )

Yes, so the earlier formula is correct. So substituting the numbers gives h ≈ 2.96 cm, which is option G.

But wait, the options I see are:

A:8.88 cm

B:10.36 cm

C:4.44 cm

D:3.70 cm

E:6.22 cm

F:5.92 cm

G:2.96 cm

H:1.48 cm

I:7.44 cm

J:0.74 cm

So G is an option.

Wait, but why am I hesitating? Because I thought sometimes when the tube is very narrow, the rise is higher. But 1 mm is quite narrow, so perhaps 3 cm is about right.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in unit conversion. Let me double-check.

Wait, radius r is 0.5 mm, which is 0.05 cm. Correct.

γ is 72.62 dyn/cm.

ρ is 1 g/cm³.

g is 980 cm/s².

So substituting:

h = (2 *72.62) / (0.05 * 1 * 980 )

Compute denominator: 0.05 * 980 = 49.

Numerator: 145.24.

145.24 /49 = 2.96 cm.

So that seems correct. So option G is the answer.

Wait, but another possibility: Maybe I should have used the formula with diameter instead of radius.

Wait, let me try that again.

Using diameter d=1 mm=0.1 cm.

h = (4 γ cosθ) / (ρ g d )

Which would be 4*72.62 / (1 *980 *0.1 )

4 *72.62 = 290.48.

Denominator: 980 *0.1 =98.

290.48 /98 = same as before, 2.96 cm.

Same result.

So the correct answer is G:2.96 cm.

To determine the height to which water rises in a capillary tube, we use the formula for capillary rise:

\[
h = \frac{2 \gamma \cos\theta}{\rho g r}
\]

Where:
- \( \gamma = 72.62 \, \text{dyn/cm} \) (surface tension of water),
- \( \theta = 0^\circ \) (contact angle for water with glass, so \( \cos\theta = 1 \)),
- \( \rho = 1 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \) (density of water),
- \( g = 980 \, \text{cm/s}^2 \) (acceleration due to gravity),
- \( r = 0.05 \, \text{cm} \) (radius of the capillary tube, since the diameter is \( 1.0 \, \text{mm} = 0.1 \, \text{cm} \)).

Substituting the values:

\[
h = \frac{2 \cdot 72.62}{1 \cdot 980 \cdot 0.05}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
2 \cdot 72.62 = 145.24
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
1 \cdot 980 \cdot 0.05 = 49
\]

Now, divide:

\[
h = \frac{145.24}{49} \approx 2.96 \, \text{cm}
\]

This matches option **G**. The calculations confirm that the height to which water rises in the capillary tube is approximately **2.96 cm**.
