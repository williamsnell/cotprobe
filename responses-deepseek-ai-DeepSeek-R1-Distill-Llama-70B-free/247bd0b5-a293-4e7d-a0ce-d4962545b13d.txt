Okay, so Jim bought a vacuum cleaner that's priced at $69.75, and there's a 5% discount. I need to figure out how much he paid in total after the discount and the sales taxes. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, the original price is $69.75, and there's a 5% discount. So I should calculate the discount amount first. To find 5% of 69.75, I can multiply 69.75 by 0.05. Let me do that... 69.75 * 0.05 equals 3.4875. So the discount is $3.4875, which I can round to about $3.49.

Now, subtracting the discount from the original price gives me the discounted price. So 69.75 minus 3.4875 is... let's see, 69.75 minus 3 is 66.75, and then minus 0.4875 is 66.2625. So the price after discount is $66.2625. I'll just note that as $66.26 for now, but maybe I should keep more decimal places for accuracy.

Next, there are two sales taxes: state is 3% and city is 4%. I think these are applied to the discounted price. So I need to calculate each tax separately and then add them together. Wait, no, actually, sales taxes are usually combined. So maybe I should add the two tax rates first and then apply them to the discounted price.

So 3% plus 4% makes 7%. So the total tax rate is 7%. Now, applying 7% tax on the discounted price. The discounted price is $66.2625. So I need to calculate 7% of 66.2625. Let me compute that: 66.2625 * 0.07.

Let me do the math. 66 * 0.07 is 4.62, and 0.2625 * 0.07 is approximately 0.018375. Adding those together gives 4.62 + 0.018375 = 4.638375. So the tax is about $4.6384.

Now, adding the tax to the discounted price: 66.2625 + 4.6384 equals... 66.2625 plus 4 is 70.2625, plus 0.6384 is 70.9009. So the total comes out to approximately $70.9009. Rounding that to two decimal places would make it $70.90.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when dealing with percentages, it's easy to slip up.

Another approach is to calculate the discount first and then apply both taxes step by step. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate each tax separately and then sum everything. Let me try that.

After the discount, the price is $66.2625.

State tax is 3%, so 66.2625 * 0.03. Let me compute that: 66.2625 * 0.03 is 1.987875.

City tax is 4%, so 66.2625 * 0.04 is 2.6505.

Adding those two taxes: 1.987875 + 2.6505 equals 4.638375, which matches what I got earlier. So the total tax is indeed about $4.6384.

Adding that to the discounted price: 66.2625 + 4.6384 is 70.9009, so $70.90. That seems correct.

Looking at the options, option A is $70.90, which matches my calculation. But wait, let me check the options again. Option A is $70.90, yes. Option E is $74.39, which is higher, so that's probably not it. Option B is $72.15, which is higher than what I calculated. Option C is $71.25, also higher. Hmm, so $70.90 is the correct amount Jim paid.

Wait a second, did I consider the order of applying discount and taxes correctly? Sometimes sales tax is applied before the discount, but I think in this case, the discount is applied first because the discount is on the purchase, and then tax is calculated on the discounted amount. Because usually, discounts reduce the taxable amount. So yes, the approach was correct.

To determine how much Jim paid for the vacuum cleaner, we start with the original price of $69.75 and apply the 5% discount. The discount amount is calculated as:

\[
69.75 \times 0.05 = 3.4875
\]

Subtracting the discount from the original price gives the discounted price:

\[
69.75 - 3.4875 = 66.2625
\]

Next, we calculate the total sales tax, which is the sum of the state sales tax (3%) and the city sales tax (4%). The combined tax rate is:

\[
3\% + 4\% = 7\%
\]

Applying the 7% tax rate to the discounted price:

\[
66.2625 \times 0.07 = 4.638375
\]

Adding the tax to the discounted price gives the total amount Jim paid:

\[
66.2625 + 4.638375 = 70.9009
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, the total amount is $70.90. Comparing this result to the provided options, the correct answer is:

A: $70.90
