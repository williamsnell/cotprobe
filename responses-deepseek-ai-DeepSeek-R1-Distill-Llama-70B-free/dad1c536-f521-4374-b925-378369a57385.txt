Okay, so I've got this question here about converting a hexadecimal number to binary. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by remembering what hexadecimal and binary are.

Hexadecimal is base 16, right? So it goes from 0 to 15, and each digit is represented by 0-9 and then A-F, where A is 10, B is 11, up to F being 15. Binary is base 2, which is just 0s and 1s. Each digit in binary is a bit.

The question is asking how many bits each hexadecimal digit converts to. So I guess I need to figure out the relationship between each hex digit and its binary equivalent.

Wait, I remember that 16 is 2 to the power of 4. Because 2^4 is 16. So each hex digit can be represented by 4 bits. Because 4 bits can go from 0000 (0) to 1111 (15), which covers all 16 possibilities. That makes sense.

Let me think of an example. Let's take the hex digit 'A'. 'A' is 10 in decimal. In binary, 10 is 1010, which is 4 bits. Another example: 'F' is 15 in decimal, which is 1111 in binary, again 4 bits. And '1' is 0001, right? So each hex digit, regardless of its value, converts to exactly 4 bits.

So the question is asking, for each hex digit, how many bits? The answer should be 4 bits per hex digit.

Looking at the options, option C is 4. So the correct answer should be C.

To convert a hexadecimal number to binary, each hexadecimal digit corresponds to exactly 4 bits. This is because hexadecimal is base 16, and 16 is 2‚Å¥, meaning 4 bits are required to represent each hexadecimal digit uniquely. For example, the hexadecimal digit 'A' (10 in decimal) is '1010' in binary, and 'F' (15 in decimal) is '1111' in binary. Thus, every hexadecimal digit translates to 4 bits.

The correct answer is C.
