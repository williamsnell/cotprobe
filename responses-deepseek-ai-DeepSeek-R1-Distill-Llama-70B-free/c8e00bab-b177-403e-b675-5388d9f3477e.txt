Okay, so I have this math problem here: What is 60% of 30? And there are multiple-choice options from A to J. I'm a bit new to percentages, but I think I can figure this out.

First, I remember that percent means per hundred. So 60% is the same as 60 per 100, which can be written as 60/100. To find a percentage of a number, I multiply that fraction by the number. So in this case, I need to calculate 60% of 30, which is (60/100) * 30.

Wait, let me make sure I get that right. So 60 divided by 100 is 0.6, right? Yeah, because 60 divided by 100 moves the decimal point two places to the left. So 60% becomes 0.6.

Now, I multiply 0.6 by 30. Hmm, 0.6 times 30. Let me think about that. 30 times 0.6... Well, 30 times 0.1 is 3, so 0.6 is six times that. So 3 times 6 is 18. Oh wait, no, wait. Because 0.6 is 6 times 0.1, so 30 * 0.1 is 3, then 3*6 is 18. So 0.6 * 30 = 18. 

Let me check another way to be sure. Maybe breaking it down: 10% of 30 is 3, right? Because 10% is like 10 per 100, so 30 * 0.1 =3. So 60% is six times that 10%, so 3 *6 =18. Yep, that makes sense.

Looking at the options, which one is 18? Let me see the options again. A is 80, which is too big. B is 0.18, that's way too small. C is 180, that's 10 times bigger than 18. D is 1800, way too big. E is 8, nope. F is 800, way off. G is 3, that's 10% of 30, not 60%. H is 18000, that's way too high. I is 18. Oh, so I is the correct answer. J is 1.8, which is even smaller than B.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me try another approach. 30 divided by 10 is 3, and 60 divided by 10 is 6, so 3 times 6 is 18. Yep, that's consistent.

Alternatively, using fractions: 60% is 3/5 because 60/100 simplifies to 3/5. So 3/5 of 30 is (3/5)*30. 30 divided by 5 is 6, and 6 times 3 is 18. Yep, same answer.

I think I'm confident that 18 is the right answer, which is option I.

The question asks for 60% of 30. To find this, convert 60% to a decimal (0.6) and multiply by 30. 

0.6 Ã— 30 = 18.

Checking the options, 18 corresponds to option I.
