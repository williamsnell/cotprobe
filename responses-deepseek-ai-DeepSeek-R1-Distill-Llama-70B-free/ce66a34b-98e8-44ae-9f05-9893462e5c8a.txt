Question:

Options:

E: The theory supports the idea that loans should primarily be given for speculative investments to maximize bank profits.
F: The theory advocates for unrestricted lending to any sector, regardless of the term or purpose of the loan.
G: The principle states that a bank should only offer loans to international businesses to minimize risk.

Okay, so I've got this question about the commercial loan theory of banking. Hmm, I remember from my economics class that there are different theories about how banks should operate, especially regarding what kinds of loans they should make. The question is asking about the basic principle of this theory.

The options are A through J. Let me think about what I know. The commercial loan theory, if I'm not mistaken, suggests that banks should focus on short-term commercial loans. The idea is that these loans are for business purposes, like financing inventory or day-to-day operations, which are usually seen as less risky because they can be quickly liquidated if needed.

So, looking at the options, option A says that restricting loans to short-term commercial loans assures the stability of the banking system during a crisis. That sounds right because short-term loans are easier to manage and less likely to lead to long-term problems. Option B talks about personal loans, which doesn't fit because commercial loan theory is about business, not personal. Option C mentions long-term projects, which is the opposite of what the theory proposes. Option D is about increasing interest rates, which I don't think is the main point here. Option E suggests loans for speculative investments, which seems risky and not aligned with the theory. Option F is about unrestricted lending, which doesn't make sense because the theory is about restricting to certain types. Option G talks about international businesses, which I don't recall being part of this theory. Option H is about long-term investments again, which doesn't fit. Option I says the theory is widely accepted today, but I'm not sure about its current acceptance. Option J emphasizes collateral over duration, which isn't the focus of the commercial loan theory.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on whether the theory is still accepted. I think the commercial loan theory was more prominent in the past, especially before the Great Depression, and has since been criticized for being too restrictive. So option I might not be correct. But the question is about the basic principle, not its current acceptance.

So the best answer seems to be option A: restricting loans to short-term commercial loans ensures stability.

The commercial loan theory of banking posits that banks should primarily make short-term commercial loans, as these are typically less risky and more liquid, thereby enhancing the stability of the banking system during financial crises.
