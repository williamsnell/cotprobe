Okay, so I've got this problem here about Jennifer running a marathon. Hmm, I remember marathons are 26.2 miles long. The question is asking how long it takes her to finish the race. She runs the first half at 8 mph and the second half at 6 mph. I think I need to calculate the time she takes for each half and then add them up.

Wait, so the marathon is 26.2 miles, which means each half is 13.1 miles. Oh right, because half of 26.2 is 13.1. So I should calculate the time for each 13.1 mile segment.

Time is equal to distance divided by speed. So for the first half, she's running at 8 mph. So time1 = 13.1 / 8. Let me do that calculation. 13 divided by 8 is 1.625, but wait, 13.1 is a bit more. 8 times 1.6 is 12.8, so 13.1 minus 12.8 is 0.3. So 0.3 miles at 8 mph. Time is 0.3/8 = 0.0375 hours. So total time for the first half is 1.6 + 0.0375 = 1.6375 hours. Let me write that as approximately 1.64 hours.

For the second half, she runs at 6 mph. So time2 is 13.1 / 6. Let's see, 6 times 2 is 12, so 13.1-12 is 1.1. So 1.1 miles at 6 mph. Time is 1.1/6 = 0.1833 hours. So the total time for the second half is 2 + 0.1833 = 2.1833 hours, which is about 2.18 hours.

Now, adding the two times together: 1.64 + 2.18 = 3.82 hours. So the total time is approximately 3.82 hours.

Looking at the options, option D is 3.82. So I think the correct answer is D.

To determine how long it takes Jennifer to complete the marathon, we calculate the time for each half of the race and sum them. The marathon is 26.2 miles, so each half is 13.1 miles.

1. **First half (13.1 miles at 8 mph):**  
   Using the formula \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \),  
   \( \text{time}_1 = \frac{13.1}{8} \approx 1.64 \, \text{hours} \).

2. **Second half (13.1 miles at 6 mph):**  
   \( \text{time}_2 = \frac{13.1}{6} \approx 2.18 \, \text{hours} \).

3. **Total time:**  
   Adding the two times:  
   \( 1.64 + 2.18 = 3.82 \, \text{hours} \).

Thus, the total time for Jennifer to complete the race is approximately **3.82 hours**.

The correct answer is **D: 3.82**.
