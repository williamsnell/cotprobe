Okay, so I've got this problem here about waiting times for the next occurrence of a random variable. Let me try to unpack it step by step.

Alright, the problem says that we have a sequence of i.i.d. random variables X_0, X_1, X_2, and so on. They're drawn from some distribution p(x), and each x is in the set {1, 2, 3, ..., 100}. So x can take any integer value from 1 to 100, inclusive. 

The question is about the expectation of N, which is the waiting time until the next occurrence of X_0. So N is the number of trials we need to wait until we see the same value again as X_0. 

Hmm, okay, so X_0 is the initial value, and then X_1, X_2, etc., are the subsequent draws. We need to find the expected waiting time until X_0 appears again.

Wait, so N is the smallest n such that X_n equals X_0, right? But wait, no, the way it's phrased is that N is the waiting time to the next occurrence of X_0. So maybe N is the number of trials starting from X_1 until we hit X_0 again. So for example, if X_0 is 5, and the first X_1 is 5, then N would be 1. If X_1 is not 5 but X_2 is 5, then N is 2, etc.

So the problem is asking for E[N], the expected value of N.

I remember that for such problems, if each trial is independent and has the same probability, this sounds like a geometric distribution. The geometric distribution models the number of trials until the first success, where each trial is independent and has the same probability of success p.

Wait, in the geometric distribution, the expected value is 1/p, right? Because you're waiting for the first success, and each trial has a probability p of success.

But wait, in this case, what's the probability of success for each trial? The success would be that X_i equals X_0. So each X_i is drawn from p(x), which is a probability distribution over 1 to 100. But X_0 is a specific value, say x0, and each subsequent X_i has a probability p(x0) of being x0.

Wait, but wait: since all the X_i are i.i.d., each X_i (for i ≥1) has the same probability distribution as X_0. So the probability that any X_i equals X_0 is the sum over all possible x of p(x) * p(x), because X_0 can be any x, and then X_i is also x. Wait, no, that's not correct. X_i is a single draw, so the probability that X_i equals X_0 is sum_x p(x)^2, because for each x, the probability that X_0 is x is p(x) and the X_i is x is p(x), so the joint probability is p(x)^2. But that's the probability that X_i equals X_0, but for all i.

Wait, no, wait a second. Let me think again. The problem is that X_0 is given, and then each X_i is a new draw. So for each trial i (i ≥1), the probability that X_i equals X_0 is p(X_0), because X_0 is a specific value, let's say x0. So each X_i has a probability p(x0) of being x0. So each trial is a Bernoulli trial with success probability p = p(x0). 

Wait, but wait, in that case, the expectation of N would be 1/p(x0), since it's a geometric distribution with success probability p(x0). But wait, p(x0) is the probability that a single X_i equals x0. So E[N] would be 1/p(x0). But we're to compute the expectation over all possible X_0. Because X_0 is random, we need to take the expectation over X_0 as well.

Ah, right. So E[N] is the expectation of 1/p(X_0). Because for each X_0 = x, the expectation is 1/p(x). So the overall expectation is E[1/p(X_0)].

So E[N] = E[1/p(X_0)] = sum_{x=1 to 100} p(x) * (1/p(x)) ) = sum_{x=1 to 100} 1 = 100.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, that sum would be 100 because each term is 1, and there are 100 terms. So E[N] would be 100.

Wait, but wait, let me check that again. Because for each x, the probability that X_0 is x is p(x), and given that, the expected waiting time is 1/p(x). So the overall expectation is sum_{x} p(x) * (1/p(x)) ) = sum_{x} 1, which is 100. So E[N] is 100.

Looking at the options, option H is 100.0. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but am I missing something here? Let me think again. Let me consider a simpler case. Suppose that the distribution p(x) is uniform, so p(x) = 1/100 for each x. Then, the probability that any X_i equals X_0 is 1/100, so the expectation is 100. That makes sense, because in the uniform case, the expected waiting time is 100. So that aligns with the above calculation.

But what if p(x) isn't uniform? For example, suppose p(x) is higher for some x and lower for others. Then, E[N] would still be the sum of 1's, which is 100, regardless of p(x). That seems odd, because in reality, if p(x) is higher for some x, then the expected waiting time could be lower.

Wait a minute, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express the problem.

N is the waiting time for X_0 to occur again. So, if we have X_0, and then we look at X_1, X_2, etc., until we find X_n = X_0, then N is the smallest n where this happens. So N is a geometrically distributed random variable with parameter p = p(X_0). But since X_0 is random, we have to take expectation over X_0.

Wait, no, wait. For a given X_0 = x, the waiting time until the next x is geometric with p = p(x). So the expectation for that x is 1/p(x). Then, the overall expectation is E[1/p(X_0)] = sum_{x} p(x) * (1/p(x)) ) = sum_{x} 1 = 100, as before.

So regardless of the distribution p(x), the expectation is 100. So the answer is H.

Alternatively, maybe I can model this problem differently. Let me think about the probability that N is greater than n. So P(N > n) is the probability that none of X_1, X_2, ..., X_n equal X_0. 

But since each X_i is independent of X_0, the probability that X_i ≠ X_0 is 1 - p(X_0). So P(N > n) = E[ (1 - p(X_0))^n ].

Hmm, alternatively, since X_0 is random, the expectation can be calculated as sum_{x} p(x) * (1 - p(x))^n.

But I'm not sure if this approach is more helpful. Alternatively, using the law of total expectation, E[N] = E[ E[ N | X_0 ] ] = E[ 1/p(X_0) ].

So that again gives E[N] = sum_{x} p(x) * (1/p(x)) ) = 100.

Wait, but this seems to suggest that no matter the distribution, the expectation is 100. That's a bit counter-intuitive because if some x have higher p(x), then the waiting time until they reoccur should be lower. But since X_0 is selected according to p(x), perhaps higher p(x) x's are more likely to be X_0, but each has a lower expected waiting time. So the average might still be 100.

Wait, let's take a specific example. Suppose p(x) is such that p(1) = 1 and p(x) = 0 for all x !=1. Then X_0 is always 1, and X_1 will always be 1. So N is 1 with probability 1. So E[N] = 1, not 100. But according to our previous calculation, it would be 100. So that's a contradiction. So where is the mistake?

Ah, I see. So in this case, when p(x) is a delta function at 1, E[N] is 1, not 100. So our previous conclusion that E[N] is 100 is incorrect. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, so that suggests that the earlier approach is wrong. Let's reevaluate.

Wait, in that case, when p(x) is 1 at x=1, then X_0 is always 1. Then, for N, each X_i is 1, so N is 1. So E[N] is 1, but according to the sum_{x} p(x) * (1/p(x)) ), which would be sum_{x} 1, but p(x) is zero except for x=1. So sum would be 1, because only x=1 contributes 1*1 =1. Wait, but that's correct. So in that case, E[N] =1, which is correct.

Wait, another test case: suppose p(x) is uniform, p(x) = 1/100 for each x. Then E[N] = sum_{x} (1/100) * 100 = 100, which is correct.

Wait, but when p(x) is such that p(1)=1, then E[N] =1, which is correct. So the formula E[N] = sum_{x} 1 = number of possible x's, but wait, no, in the case where p(x) is 1 at x=1, the sum is 1, because only x=1 is present. So E[N] =1.

Wait, so the general formula is E[N] = sum_{x} 1, over the support of p(x). Because for each x, p(x) contributes 1 to the sum. So if all x have p(x) >0, the sum is 100. But if some x have zero probability, then the sum is the number of x's with p(x) >0.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again. E[N] = sum_{x} p(x) * (1/p(x)) ) = sum_{x} 1, but only over x where p(x) >0. So if p(x) is zero for some x, they don't contribute to the sum. So for example, if p(x) is zero except for x=1, then the sum is 1. If p(x) is uniform over 100 x's, the sum is 100.

So in the problem, the x is in {1,2,...,100}, but perhaps p(x) may have some zero probabilities. But the problem statement doesn't specify, so perhaps we can assume that each x has p(x) >0. Or perhaps the problem assumes that p(x) is such that each x is possible.

Wait, the problem states that x is in {1,2,...,100}, but doesn't specify that p(x) is positive for all x. So maybe we can assume that p(x) is positive for all x; otherwise, the sum would be less than 100. But without more information, perhaps the problem assumes that all x are equally likely, so p(x) =1/100 for all x. But in that case, E[N] is 100, which is option H.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify that the distribution is uniform. Hmm. So perhaps the answer is 100 regardless, but that can't be right because in the earlier example where p(x) is 1 at x=1, E[N] is 1, not 100. So I'm confused.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me model N as the waiting time until the first occurrence of X_0 in the sequence X_1, X_2, etc.

So for each i ≥1, the probability that X_i equals X_0 is p(X_0), since X_i is independent of X_0. Therefore, the trials are Bernoulli trials with success probability p(X_0).

Wait, but since X_0 is random, perhaps we can model this as a mixture of geometric distributions. So the expectation would be E[N] = E[1/p(X_0)].

Which is sum_{x} p(x) * (1/p(x)) ) = sum_{x} 1, but as I thought before.

Wait, but in the case where p(x) is 1 at x=1, then sum is 1, which is correct. If p(x) is uniform, sum is 100, correct. If p(x) is zero for some x, then those x's don't contribute, but in the problem, x is in {1,..,100}, but maybe p(x) can be zero for some.

Wait, but the problem says "x ∈ {1,2,3,…,100}", but doesn't say that p(x) >0 for all x. So perhaps the general answer is that E[N] = number of x's for which p(x) >0. But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe the intended answer is 100, assuming uniform distribution.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about it differently.

Suppose that X_0 is a particular value, say x. The probability that the next trial is x is p(x), so the expected waiting time is 1/p(x). Now, since X_0 is random, drawn from p(x), the overall expectation is E[1/p(X_0)].

But this is only correct if for each x, p(x) is the probability that X_0 is x, and the probability of each subsequent trial being x is also p(x), which is true because the variables are i.i.d.

So E[N] = sum_{x=1 to 100} p(x) * (1/p(x)) ) = sum_{x=1 to 100} 1 = 100.

So the answer is 100, which is option H.

Wait, but earlier I thought that if p(x) is 1 for x=1, then E[N] would be 1, but according to this sum, it would be 1 as well because only x=1 contributes. So the formula holds. So regardless of p(x), E[N] is the number of possible x's with p(x) >0. But in this problem, the x's are from 1 to 100, so perhaps the answer is 100, assuming all x's have p(x) >0.

So I think the correct answer is H: 100.0.

To solve the problem, we analyze the waiting time \( N \) until the next occurrence of \( X_0 \) in the sequence \( X_1, X_2, \ldots \). The random variables \( X_0, X_1, X_2, \ldots \) are i.i.d., drawn from a distribution \( p(x) \), where \( x \in \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 100\} \). The goal is to compute \( E(N) \), the expected waiting time.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Geometric Distribution Insight**:  
   For a given \( X_0 = x \), the probability that any subsequent \( X_i \) equals \( x \) is \( p(x) \). Thus, the waiting time \( N \) follows a geometric distribution with success probability \( p(x) \). The expectation of a geometrically distributed random variable is \( \frac{1}{p(x)} \).

2. **Law of Total Expectation**:  
   Since \( X_0 \) is random and drawn from \( p(x) \), the overall expectation \( E(N) \) is computed by averaging \( \frac{1}{p(x)} \) over all possible values of \( X_0 \). This gives:
   \[
   E(N) = \sum_{x=1}^{100} p(x) \cdot \frac{1}{p(x)} = \sum_{x=1}^{100} 1 = 100.
   \]

3. **Uniform Distribution Case**:  
   If \( p(x) \) is uniform, i.e., \( p(x) = \frac{1}{100} \) for all \( x \), the calculation simplifies to \( E(N) = 100 \), which aligns with the general result.

4. **Non-Uniform Distribution Case**:  
   Even if \( p(x) \) is not uniform, the formula \( E(N) = \sum_{x=1}^{100} 1 \) holds as long as all \( x \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 100\} \) have \( p(x) > 0 \). If some \( p(x) = 0 \), those terms do not contribute to the sum, but the problem does not specify such cases.

5. **Special Cases**:  
   - If \( p(x) \) is concentrated at a single value (e.g., \( p(x) = 1 \) for \( x = 1 \) and \( p(x) = 0 \) otherwise), \( E(N) = 1 \), which is consistent with the formula.
   - For a uniform distribution, \( E(N) = 100 \), which is also consistent.

### Conclusion:
The expected waiting time \( E(N) \) is determined by summing \( 1 \) over all possible values of \( x \) in \( \{1, 2, \ldots, 100\} \), assuming \( p(x) > 0 \) for all \( x \). This gives \( E(N) = 100 \).
