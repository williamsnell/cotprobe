Question:

Thomas and Chess’s (1977) “goodness-of-fit” model predicts that maladjustment in children is due to:

Options:

A: a mismatch between the child's academic abilities and his/her parents' expectations.
B: inconsistencies in the child's perception of self-worth and the feedback received from teachers.
C: inconsistencies in the child's communication skills and the feedback received from peers.
D: inconsistencies in the parenting styles of the child’s caregivers.
E: a mismatch between the child's physical activity levels and his/her parents' encouragement of physical activity.
F: a mismatch between the child's emotional needs and his/her parents' emotional availability.
G: inconsistencies in the child's peer group and their influence on the child's behavior.
H: inconsistencies in the child’s sense of self and the feedback the child receives from caregivers about his/her behavior.
I: a mismatch between the child’s basic temperament and his/her parents’ childrearing practices.
J: a mismatch between the child’s attachment behaviors and his/her parents’ response to those behaviors.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Thomas and Chess’s "goodness-of-fit" model. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

I remember that Thomas and Chess did some work on temperament in children. Their model is about how a child's behavior and the environment interact. The question is asking about what causes maladjustment according to their model.

The options are A through J. Let me go through each one to see which fits.

Option A says a mismatch between the child's academic abilities and parents' expectations. That sounds more like something related to school performance, maybe something else like the Pygmalion effect or self-fulfilling prophecy. Not sure if it's about goodness-of-fit.

Option B: Inconsistencies between the child's self-worth and teacher feedback. That seems more about self-esteem and teacher interactions. Maybe not the main point here.

Option C: Communication skills and peer feedback. That might relate to social skills, but I don't think that's what Thomas and Chess focused on.

Option D: Parenting styles inconsistencies. That could be about inconsistent discipline, but I'm not certain if that's the goodness-of-fit model.

Option E: Physical activity levels and parents' encouragement. Maybe, but I don't recall this being a key point in their model.

Option F: Emotional needs and parents' availability. This sounds a bit like attachment theory, perhaps, but maybe related to fit.

Option G: Peer group influence. No, I think their model is more about the child's individual traits and the environment, like family.

Option H: Sense of self and caregiver feedback. That's about self-concept, possibly, but I'm not sure if that's the exact fit.

Option I: Temperament and childrearing practices. Oh wait, I think this is it. Because I remember that Thomas and Chess talked about how the child's temperament (like being easy or difficult) interacts with the parents' approach. So a mismatch here would cause problems.

Option J: Attachment behaviors and parents' response. That's more from attachment theory, like Bowlby or Ainsworth. So probably not the answer here.

So putting it together, the goodness-of-fit model is about how the child's natural temperament aligns with the way the parents are raising them. So if the parent's style doesn't match the child's temperament, that's a poor fit, leading to maladjustment.

Therefore, the correct answer should be I.

The "goodness-of-fit" model by Thomas and Chess (1977) focuses on the interaction between a child's temperament and their environment, particularly the childrearing practices of their parents. According to this model, maladjustment arises when there is a mismatch between the child's inherent temperament and the parenting style or practices. This mismatch can lead to behavioral and emotional difficulties for the child.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option I** directly addresses this concept, as it highlights the mismatch between the child's temperament and the parents' childrearing practices.
- Other options, such as those involving academic abilities, self-worth, communication skills, or peer influences, do not align with the core idea of the goodness-of-fit model.
- Options related to emotional needs or attachment behaviors are more relevant to other psychological theories, such as attachment theory, and not Thomas and Chess's model.

Thus, the correct answer is **I**.

Answer: I
