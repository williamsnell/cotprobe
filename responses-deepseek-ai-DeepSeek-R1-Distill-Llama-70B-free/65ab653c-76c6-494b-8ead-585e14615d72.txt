Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the Ksp of CaF2. Hmm, I remember that Ksp is the solubility product constant, which tells us about the solubility of a compound in water. Let me try to work through this step by step. 

The problem says that a saturated solution of CaF2 contains 0.00168 grams per 100 grams of water. I think the first thing I need to do is figure out the molar solubility of CaF2 from that information. 

Wait, right, molar solubility is moles per liter. But wait, the grams given are per 100 grams of water, not per liter. So I should probably convert that to grams per liter first. Since 100 grams of water is approximately 0.1 liters (because 1 liter is about 1000 grams, so 100g is 0.1 L), but wait, no, wait. No, 100 g is 0.1 kg, but in terms of volume, 1 kg is roughly 1 liter. So 100g is 0.1 liters. So 0.00168 grams per 100g H2O would be 0.0168 grams per liter. Because 0.00168 g/0.1 L = 0.0168 g/L. Yeah, that makes sense.

Next, I need to find the number of moles of CaF2 that corresponds to. The molar mass of CaF2... let's see, calcium (Ca) has an atomic weight of about 40.08 g/mol. Fluorine (F) is about 19.00 each. So CaF2 would be 40.08 + (2 * 19.00) = 40.08 + 38 = 78.08 g/mol. So to find moles, I divide grams by molar mass. 

So 0.0168 g/L divided by 78.08 g/mol equals... let's calculate that. 0.0168 /78.08. Let me do that division. 78.08 is approximately 78, so 0.0168 /78 ≈ 0.0002154 mol/L. Wait, let me be more precise. 78.08 * 0.000215 is about 0.01677, which is close to 0.0168, so yeah, approximately 2.15e-4 mol/L. So the solubility (s) is 2.15e-4 M.

But wait, CaF2 dissociates into Ca²+ and 2 F^- ions. The dissolution equation is CaF2(s) ⇌ Ca²+(aq) + 2 F⁻(aq). So for every mole of CaF2 that dissolves, we get one mole of Ca²+ and two moles of F⁻. 

So the concentrations would be [Ca²+] = s and [F⁻] = 2s. Then the solubility product Ksp is [Ca²+][F⁻]^2. Which is s*(2s)^2. That would be s*(4s²) = 4s³.

So substituting s = 2.15e-4, Ksp =4*(2.15e-4)^3. Let me compute that. 

First, cube 2.15e-4: (2.15)^3 = approx 2.15 * 2.15 = 4.6225, then 4.6225 *2.15. Let's see: 4 * 2.15 is 8.6. 0.6225 *2.15 is about 1.337. So total around 9.937. So (2.15e-4)^3 is about 9.937e-12. Multiply by 4: 4 *9.937e-12 = 3.975e-11. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, that seems small. Let me check my calculations again. Maybe I made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, 2.15e-4 is 0.000215. Cubing that: 0.000215 * 0.000215 = 4.6225e-8, then multiplied by 0.000215 again: 4.6225e-8 * 2.15e-4 = (4.6225 * 2.15) * 1e-12. 4.6225 times 2 is 9.245, 4.6225 times 0.15 is ~0.693, total around 9.938. So 9.938e-12. Multiply by 4: 3.975e-11. So Ksp is about 3.975e-11? Hmm, but that's not matching any of the options given. Wait, the options are all around 1e-8 or so. Did I make a mistake in calculations?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the initial conversion from grams to moles. Let me double-check that. The given is 0.00168 grams in 100 grams of water. So 100 grams is 0.1 kg, but in terms of volume, water is about 0.1 liters (since 1kg=1L). So the concentration is 0.00168 g / 0.1 L = 0.0168 g/L. Molar mass of CaF2 is 78.08 g/mol, so 0.0168 /78.08 = approx 0.0002154 mol/L, which is 2.154e-4 M. That seems correct.

Then, Ksp = 4*(s)^3 = 4*(2.154e-4)^3. Let me compute (2.154e-4)^3. 2.154^3 is approximately 2.154 *2.154 = approx 4.63, then 4.63 *2.154 ≈ 9.97. So (2.154e-4)^3 is 9.97e-12. Multiply by 4: 3.988e-11. So Ksp ≈ 4e-11. But looking at the options, they are all around 1e-8 or lower, like option A is 2.11e-8, B 2.73e-8, etc. So I'm getting 4e-11, which is way smaller than any option provided. That suggests I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I confused grams per liter with grams per solution. Oh wait, no, the grams given are per 100g of water, but I converted that correctly to g/L. Alternatively, maybe the initial mass was misread. Let me check the problem again: .00168g per 100g of water. So that's 0.00168 grams in 0.1 liters, so 0.0168 g/L, which is correct.

Wait, maybe I messed up the stoichiometry. Let me think again. The dissolution is CaF2 → Ca²+ + 2F⁻. So for each mole of CaF2 that dissolves, we get 1 mole of Ca²+ and 2 moles of F⁻. So the concentrations are [Ca²+] = s and [F⁻] = 2s. So Ksp = [Ca²+][F⁻]^2 = s*(2s)^2 = 4s³. That part seems correct.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the molar mass calculation. Let me check. Calcium is about 40.08, Fluorine is 19.00 each. So CaF2 is 40.08 + (2*19.00) = 40.08 +38=78.08 g/mol. That's correct.

Wait, maybe I made an error in the calculation of s. Let's compute 0.0168 g/L divided by 78.08 g/mol. Let me do this more accurately. 0.0168 /78.08. 

So 78.08 * 0.000215 = 0.01677, which is very close to 0.0168. So s = approximately 0.000215 mol/L.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute it exactly. Let me do 0.0168 /78.08. Let's see, 78.08 × 2.15e-4 = 0.0168. So yes, exactly 2.15e-4.

So s=2.15e-4 M.

Then, Ksp is 4*(2.15e-4)^3.

Compute (2.15e-4)^3: (2.15)^3 = 9.94 (approx), so (2.15e-4)^3 =9.94e-12. Multiply by 4, Ksp=3.976e-11.

But the options don't have anything near 4e-11. So I must have made a mistake. Maybe I confused grams of CaF2 with something else. Alternatively, perhaps the initial grams per 100g H2O is 0.00168 grams, but maybe it's per 100g solution, not water. Wait, the problem says per 100g of water. So my initial approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the calculation. Let me compute s more accurately. Let's compute 0.0168 g/L divided by 78.08 g/mol.

0.0168 /78.08 = let's compute this. 78.08 × 0.000215 = 0.016772, which is very close to 0.0168. So s ≈ 0.000215 mol/L.

So Ksp =4*(0.000215)^3.

Compute 0.000215^3: (2.15e-4)^3 = (2.15)^3 *1e-12 = 9.94 *1e-12 =9.94e-12.

Multiply by 4: 39.76e-12 =3.976e-11.

Hmm, but none of the options are close to this. Let me look at the options again. The options are:

A: 2.11 × 10^-8

B: 2.73 × 10^-8

C: 1.08 × 10^-8

D: 3.92 × 10^-8

E: 4.77 × 10^-8

F: 7.84 × 10^-8

G: 6.45 × 10^-8

H: 8.21 × 10^-9

I: 5.62 × 10^-8

J: 1.50 × 10^-7

So all of them are in the 1e-8 to 1e-7 range, but my calculation gives 4e-11, which is way off. What's wrong here?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Oh wait! Maybe the grams per 100g of water is 0.00168 grams, but I converted that to 0.0168 grams per liter? Because 100 grams is 0.1 liters, so grams per liter would be 0.00168 g / 0.1 L = 0.0168 g/L. Wait, that's correct. So that's right.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 0.00168 grams per 100 grams of water. So if you have 100 grams of water, that's 0.1 kg, but in terms of volume, it's approximately 0.1 liters. So the concentration is 0.00168 grams in 0.1 liters. So to get grams per liter, you divide by 0.1 L: 0.00168 g / 0.1 L = 0.0168 g/L. That's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Wait, CaF2 dissociates into Ca²+ and 2 F⁻. So when s moles of CaF2 dissolve, you get s moles of Ca²+ and 2s moles of F⁻. So Ksp is [Ca²+][F⁻]^2 = s*(2s)^2 =4s^3. That seems correct.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong molar mass. Let me double-check: Ca is 40.08, F is 19.00. So CaF2 is 40.08 + 2*19.00 =78.08 g/mol. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the given value is 0.00168 grams per 100 grams of solution, not per 100 grams of water. Oh! That's a different thing. Because 100 grams of solution would have both solute and solvent. So if the solution is dilute, the solvent is about 100 grams, but the solution's mass is 100 grams, so the water is about 100 - 0.00168 grams, which is negligible, but maybe that's where I went wrong.

Wait, the problem says "per 100g of water", so I think that part is correct. So maybe I need to think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of s. Let me recalculate it precisely. 0.0168 g/L divided by 78.08 g/mol.

Let me compute 0.0168 /78.08.

78.08 × 0.000215 = 0.016772, which is 0.016772 grams. The given is 0.0168 grams, which is very close. So s=0.000215 mol/L is correct.

So Ksp =4*(0.000215)^3.

Wait, 0.000215 is 2.15e-4. So (2.15e-4)^3 = (2.15)^3 * 1e-12 = let's calculate 2.15^3 precisely.

2.15 *2.15 = 4.6225.

4.6225 *2.15: let's compute that.

4 *2.15 =8.6

0.6225 *2.15: compute 0.6 *2.15=1.29, 0.0225*2.15=0.048375. So total 1.29 +0.048375 =1.338375. So 8.6 +1.338375=9.938375.

So (2.15e-4)^3=9.938375e-12.

Multiply by 4: 4 *9.938375e-12=3.97535e-11.

Wait, so Ksp is approximately 3.975e-11, which is 3.975 ×10^-11. But the options don't have anything that small. The closest is option H:8.21e-9, which is still much larger.

Hmm, this suggests I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula for Ksp. Let me double-check. For CaF2, the dissolution is CaF2 → Ca²+ + 2F⁻. So Ksp = [Ca²+][F⁻]^2. Yes, which is s*(2s)^2=4s^3. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated s. Let me try another approach. Let's compute the exact value.

s = 0.00168 g /100g H2O → concentration in g/L.

Wait, 100g H2O is 0.1 kg, or 0.1 liters (since 1L ≈1kg). So 0.00168 g in 0.1 L is 0.0168 g/L. Correct.

s = 0.0168 g/L /78.08 g/mol.

Compute 0.0168 /78.08 = Let me use calculator steps.

78.08 × 0.000215 = 0.016772, which is 0.016772 g. The given is 0.0168g. So s=0.000215 mol/L.

So that's correct. Then Ksp=4*(0.000215)^3=3.975e-11.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the initial mass is actually per liter of solution, not per 100g of water. Because sometimes, solubility is given in g per 100g of solution, not water. If that's the case, then the calculation changes.

Wait, the problem states "per 100g of water", so I think the initial approach is correct. So maybe the mistake is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the grams given are 0.00168 grams per 100g of solution. That would change things. Let me try that scenario.

If the solution is 100g, and the solute is 0.00168g, then the moles would be 0.00168g /78.08 g/mol ≈ 2.154e-5 mol. Then, the volume of the solution is 100g, which is approximately 0.1 liters (since density of water is about 1g/mL, but solutions can vary, but for dilute solutions, it's close). So concentration s= 2.154e-5 /0.1 L = 2.154e-4 M. Which is the same as before. So Ksp would still be the same. So that can't be the mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor related to activity coefficients or something, but Ksp is calculated using concentrations, not activities, so that's probably not it.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing Ksp with another constant. No, the question is about Ksp, which is correct.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation of Ksp. Let me recalculate.

s=2.15e-4 M.

So 2s=4.3e-4 M.

Then Ksp= s*(2s)^2 = (2.15e-4) * (4.3e-4)^2.

Wait, wait, let me compute this correctly. Because I think I made a mistake earlier. Ksp is s*(2s)^2, which is 4s^3. But perhaps I should compute it step by step.

Compute (2s)^2: (2*(2.15e-4))^2 = (4.3e-4)^2 = (4.3)^2 *1e-8 = 18.49e-8 =1.849e-7.

Then multiply by s: 2.15e-4 *1.849e-7 = (2.15 *1.849) *1e-11.

Compute 2.15 *1.849: 2 *1.849=3.698; 0.15*1.849≈0.27735. So total ≈3.698 +0.27735=3.97535.

So Ksp=3.
