Okay, so I've got this problem here about pumping water through a pipe, and I need to find the surface roughness of the pipe. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, let's see what's given. The flow rate is 500 cfm, which I think stands for cubic feet per minute. The pipe is horizontal, with an inside diameter of 10 inches and a length of 800 feet. The pump is 65% efficient and requires 80 horsepower input. I need to find the surface roughness, which relates to the friction losses in the pipe, I believe.

Wait, surface roughness... that's usually related to the Reynolds number and the friction factor in pipe flow. Oh right, the Moody diagram! So I'll probably need to calculate the friction factor and then relate it to the roughness.

First, I should convert the flow rate to a more usable unit. 500 cfm is cubic feet per minute, but I think I need the velocity in feet per second or something else. Oh wait, velocity in the pipe is important. Let's calculate that.

The pipe's diameter is 10 inches, so radius is 5 inches. But wait, for area, I need to convert that to feet. Oh, 10 inches is 10/12 feet, which is 0.8333 feet. So radius would be half of that, 0.4167 feet. Wait, no, area is pi * r squared. Or maybe it's easier to calculate the cross-sectional area in square feet.

The formula for the area of a pipe is A = π (d/2)^2. So d is 10 inches, which is 10/12 = 0.8333 feet. So A = π * (0.8333/2)^2. Let me compute that. 0.8333 /2 is 0.41665 feet. Squared is about 0.1736 square feet. Multiply by π gives approximately 0.545 square feet. Wait, maybe I should double-check that calculation.

Alternatively, since diameter is 10 inches, the cross-sectional area in square feet is π*(10/12 inches / 2)^2. Wait, no, inches need to be converted to feet. So 10 inches is 10/12 ft = 0.8333 ft. So radius is 0.41665 ft. Area is π*(0.41665)^2. Let's compute that: 0.41665^2 is approx 0.1736. Multiply by π: 0.1736 * 3.1416 ≈ 0.545 square feet. Yeah, that seems right.

The flow rate is 500 cfm, which is 500 cubic feet per minute. To find the velocity, v = Q/A. So Q is 500 cfm, which is 500/60 cubic feet per second, since there's 60 seconds in a minute. Wait, no, actually, velocity is Q/A, but Q needs to be in volume per time. So 500 cfm is 500 CFM, which is 500 ft³/min. So velocity v = 500 / (A * time). Wait, no: v (ft/s) = (500 ft³/min) / (A (ft²)) ) * (1 min / 60 s) = (500/(A*60)) ) ft/s.

So plugging in A as 0.545 ft²: 500 / (0.545 *60) = 500 /32.7 ≈ 15.3 ft/s. Is that right? Let me check the numbers again.

Wait, 0.545 *60 is 32.7. 500 /32.7 is about 15.3 ft/s. Yeah, that seems correct.

Next, I should find the Reynolds number, Re, which is (v * d) / ν. Where ν is the kinematic viscosity of water. I think for water, ν is about 1.05e-5 ft²/s at around 20°C. Let me confirm that value. Yes, I recall that the kinematic viscosity of water is approximately 1.05 x 10^-5 ft²/s.

So d is in feet, which is 0.8333 ft. So Re = (15.3 ft/s * 0.8333 ft) / 1.05e-5 ft²/s.

Calculating numerator: 15.3 * 0.8333 ≈ 12.75 ft²/s. Then, 12.75 / 1.05e-5 ≈ 1,214,285. So Re is approximately 1.2e6, which is 1,200,000. That puts the flow in the turbulent region, which is expected for pipes.

Now, I need to find the friction factor. But how? Oh, right, the Moody diagram relates Re, relative roughness (ε/d), and the friction factor f. But since I don't know ε (the roughness), which is what I'm trying to find, I'll need to calculate the head loss and relate it to the power, then work backwards to find f and hence ε.

So the head loss due to friction is given by h_f = (f * L * v²) / (d * g), where L is the pipe length, d is diameter, g is acceleration due to gravity.

But to find h_f, I think I'll have to compute the power required and relate it to the head.

Wait, the pump's input power is 80 hp, and it's 65% efficient. So the useful power output is 0.65 *80 hp = 52 hp. Because efficiency is output power over input power.

Power is related to head by P = (weight * flow rate * head) / (550), since 1 hp = 550 ft-lbf/s. Wait, weight of water is 62.4 lb/ft³. So the weight flow rate would be 500 cfm *62.4 lb/ft³ * (1 ft³/min * 1 min/60 s) )? Wait, maybe better to think in terms of mass flow.

Alternatively, the power output is P = γ * Q * h, where γ is specific weight (weight density) of water, Q is flow rate in ft³/s, h is head in ft.

Let me get the units right. Specific weight γ for water is 62.4 lb/ft³. Q is 500 cfm, which is 500/60 ft³/s. So Q is approximately 8.333 ft³/s.

So P = γ * Q * h. So rearranged, h = P/(γ*Q).

But the power from the pump is 52 hp (since 80 hp input, 65% efficient gives 52 hp output). Now, convert 52 hp to ft-lbf/s. Since 1 hp = 550 ft-lbf/s, so 52 hp = 52 *550 = 28,600 ft-lbf/s.

But wait, power is in ft-lbf/s, and γ is in lb/ft³, Q is in ft³/s. So let's plug in the numbers:

h = P/(γ*Q) = (28,600 ft-lbf/s) / (62.4 lb/ft³ * 8.333 ft³/s )

Calculate denominator: 62.4 *8.333 ≈ 520. Let's see: 62.4 *8 = 499.2, 62.4*0.333≈20.8, so total about 520.

So h ≈28,600 /520 ≈55. So h is approximately 55 feet.

Wait, but h is the head added by the pump. And this head is used to overcome the friction losses in the pipe (assuming no elevation change since the pipe is horizontal). So h = h_f.

So h_f =55 ft.

Now, using the head loss formula: h_f = (f * L * v²) / (d * g). I can solve for f.

We have h_f =55, L=800 ft, v=15.3 ft/s, d=0.8333 ft, g=32.2 ft/s².

Plugging in: 55 = (f *800 * (15.3)^2) / (0.8333 *32.2 )

Let me compute the denominator part: 0.8333 *32.2 ≈26.83.

Numerator: f *800 * (15.3)^2. 15.3 squared is about 234.09. So 800 *234.09 = 187,272. So numerator is f *187,272.

So 55 = (f *187272) /26.83 → 55 *26.83 /187272 = f.

Calculate numerator: 55 *26.83 ≈1476.65. So f ≈1476.65 /187272 ≈0.00788.

So f is approximately 0.00788, or about 0.0079.

Now, with the friction factor f known, we can use the Moody diagram or an approximation to find the relative roughness (ε/d) and then ε.

The Colebrook equation is an implicit equation that relates these variables:

1/√f = 2 log ( (ε/(3.7 d)) + (1/Re √f) )

But since Re is large (1.2e6), the term 1/(Re sqrt(f)) is negligible. So we can approximate using the Moody diagram's turbulent flow rough pipe equation: 1/√f ≈ 2 log ( (ε/(d) ) / 3.7 )

Wait, more accurately, for fully turbulent flow, the friction factor can be expressed as:

1/√f = 2 log ( (d) / (ε) ) + 2 log ( (ε/(3.7 d)) )? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the Moody diagram for turbulent flow in the fully rough zone (which is when the flow is fully rough and Re is high enough) can be approximated by the equation:

1/√f = 2 log ( (d)/(ε) ) + 0.74

Wait, no, another approach: For high Reynolds numbers, the friction factor depends only on the relative roughness, ε/d. So for a given ε/d, there's a corresponding f. 

Alternatively, using the approximation formula for friction factor in the fully rough region:

f = (1/4) * (ε/d)^(1/3) / (log( (ε/d)^(1/3) ))^2 )

Wait, perhaps it's better to look up or use an iterative approach, but since I don't have exact numbers, perhaps using the Moody diagram correlation.

Wait, in practice, for fully rough flow, the friction factor is given by f = (1/4) * ( (ε/d) / 3.7 )^ (1/3) )^2. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Moody equation.

Alternatively, since the Re is very high (1.2e6), we can assume that we're in the fully rough region where f depends only on ε/d.

The formula in the fully rough region is:

f = [ (1/4) * ln( (ε/d)/(3.7) ) ]^2 

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The Colebrook-White equation is:

1/√f = 2 log( (ε/(d))/(3.7) + 2.51/(Re √f) )

At high Re, the second term (2.51/(Re sqrt(f))) becomes negligible, so:

1/√f ≈ 2 log( (ε/(d * 3.7) ) )

Which can be rearranged as:

sqrt(f) ≈ 1/(2 log( (ε/(3.7 d)) ))

Hmm, but solving for ε is tricky. Alternatively, perhaps using an approximate formula for f in terms of ε/d when Re is very large.

Wait, I think in the fully rough region, the friction factor can be approximated by f = ( (ε/d) )^(1/3) / (2 * (log( (ε/d)^(1/3) )) )

Wait, maybe I should use the equation:

f = (1/4) * ( (ε/d) )^ (1/3) ) / ( log( (ε/d)^(1/3) ) )^2 )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps using the approximation for f when Re is high, which is f = 0.00625 * (ε/d)^(1/4) * (1 - (1/7) log( (ε/d)^(1/4) )) )

No, perhaps it's better to use the Moody diagram values. Let's look up typical friction factors for various ε/d values.

Wait, but without the Moody diagram in front of me, I have to go from memory or a formula.

Alternatively, since f is approximately 0.0079, let's think about what ε/d would give f=0.0079.

I remember that for ε/d of about 0.0005 (which would be a smooth pipe), f is around 0.016. Wait, no, wait: no, in the turbulent region, for a smooth pipe, f is lower. Wait, perhaps I have this backwards.

Wait, let me think of some typical values. For new, clean steel pipe, ε is about 0.0018 inches. The diameter is 10 inches, so ε/d is 0.0018/10 = 0.00018, or 0.018%. Looking up in the Moody diagram for Re=1e6, the friction factor f is around 0.016. But I'm getting f=0.0079, which is lower, which suggests that maybe the pipe is smoother? Wait, no, lower f would imply a smoother pipe. Because a rougher pipe causes higher friction.

Wait, but my calculated f is 0.0079, which is lower than 0.016. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, wait, no. Let's double-check the calculations.

Earlier, I computed f ≈0.0079. Let me recheck that.

h_f = (f * L * v²) / (d * g)

h_f is 55 ft.

So f = (h_f * d * g) / ( L * v² )

Plugging in numbers:

h_f =55, d=0.8333 ft, g=32.2 ft/s², L=800 ft, v=15.3 ft/s.

So f = (55 * 0.8333 *32.2 ) / (800 * (15.3)^2 )

Compute numerator: 55 * 0.8333 ≈45.833, 45.833 *32.2 ≈1,476. So numerator≈1,476.

Denominator: 800 * (15.3)^2. 15.3^2 is 234.09. 800 *234.09 = 187,272.

So f=1,476 /187,272 ≈0.00788. So same as before, about 0.0079.

Wait, but earlier I thought that for a steel pipe with ε/d=0.00018, the f is around 0.016. So why is my f lower? That suggests that the pipe is smoother, but that's impossible because the calculation is based on the given data. So perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption that the pump's power relates directly to the head loss.

Wait, wait. Let me think again about the power and head loss calculation.

The pump's output power is 52 hp, which is 52 *550 ft-lbf/s =28,600 ft-lbf/s. The power is also equal to the weight flow rate times the head (h), right?

Weight flow rate is Q (ft³/s) times specific weight γ (lb/ft³). So P = γ * Q * h.

So h = P/(γ Q) = 28,600 / (62.4 lb/ft³ * 8.333 ft³/s )

Calculating that denominator: 62.4 *8.333 ≈520 lb/s^3 (?) Not sure about the units, but let's compute numerically: 62.4 *8.333 ≈ 520. So 28,600 /520 ≈55 ft. So that seems correct. So h is 55 ft.

So the head loss is 55 ft. That seems high, but perhaps given the long pipe and high flow rate, it's reasonable.

Now, using the Darcy-Weisbach equation: h_f = (f L v²)/(2 g d). Wait, wait, I think I might have missed a factor earlier. Oh wait, no, the equation is h_f = (f L v²)/(2 g d), because the Darcy-Weisbach equation is h_f = (f L v²)/(2 g d), where f is the Darcy friction factor (which is 4 times the Fanning friction factor). Wait, no, in this case, I think I was using the correct equation.

Wait, I'm getting confused between Darcy and Fanning factors. Let me clarify.

The Darcy-Weisbach equation is h_f = (f_D * L * v^2)/(2 g d), where f_D is the Darcy friction factor.

The Fanning friction factor f_F is related by f_F = f_D /4.

So if in my earlier calculation, I used h_f = (f * L v^2)/(d g), that would be using f as the Darcy factor, but perhaps I should have included a factor of 2 in the denominator. Let me check the correct formula.

Wait, the correct Darcy-Weisbach equation is h_f = (f_D * L * v^2) / (2 g d). So if I used h_f = (f * L v^2)/(d g), then that implies that I used f as f_D /2. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should redo the calculation correctly.

Let me use the correct formula: h_f = (f_D * L * v^2) / (2 g d)

We have h_f =55 ft, L=800 ft, v=15.3 ft/s, d=0.8333 ft, g=32.2 ft/s².

Plugging in:

55 = (f_D *800 * (15.3)^2 ) / (2 *32.2 *0.8333 )

Compute denominator: 2 *32.2 *0.8333 ≈53.666.

Compute numerator: 800 * (15.3)^2 =800 *234.09=187,272. So numerator is f_D *187,272.

So,

55 = (f_D *187272) /53.666 → f_D = (55 *53.666) /187272.

Compute numerator:55 *53.666 ≈2946.3.

So f_D =2946.3 /
