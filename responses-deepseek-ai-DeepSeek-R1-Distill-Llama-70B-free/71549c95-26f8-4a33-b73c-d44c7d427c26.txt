Okay, so I've got this biology question here about the evolution of lung tissue in animals. Hmm, I need to figure out which group was the first to develop lungs that could support their respiratory needs without needing extra gas exchange organs.

Let me start by recalling what I know about different animal groups and their respiratory systems. I remember that fish use gills for gas exchange, right? So they extract oxygen from water using gills. But the question is about lungs, so fish might not be the answer unless they evolved something else.

Wait, there are some fish, like the amphibious ones, that can absorb a bit of oxygen from the air. But do they have lungs? I think some have swim bladders that might be related to lungs, but I'm not sure if that's the same as true lungs.

Then there are amphibians, like frogs and salamanders. They have lungs, but I also remember that they often use their skin for gas exchange, especially when they're in water. So maybe they're not the first group because they still rely on supplementary methods, like their moist skin, in addition to their lungs.

Birds have lungs that are very efficient, but they evolved from reptiles. Oh wait, the question is about the first groups, so maybe it's not birds. Plus, birds have air sacs that help with respiration, but that's probably an advanced feature, not the first.

Mammals have well-developed lungs, but again, they came after reptiles. I think the key is to find the earliest group that didn't need gills or other structures anymore.

Reptiles. I remember that reptiles were the first to develop lungs that allowed them to live entirely on land. They don't have gills as adults, relying solely on their lungs. Wait, but what about the transition from water to land? The first tetrapods (four-legged vertebrates) probably evolved from fish-like ancestors. Early amphibians might have had lungs but still used other methods.

Wait, maybe the first group to have adequate lung tissue without supplementary organs were the reptiles. Because reptiles don't need to keep their skin moist for gas exchange like amphibians do. They have a dry skin and lay eggs with shells, so they don't need water for reproduction. Their lungs are more efficient, allowing them to thrive on land without the need for gills or other gas exchange organs like the skin in amphibians.

So putting it all together: the first groups with adequate lungs would be the reptiles. So the answer should be option C: reptiles.

The first groups of animals to develop lung tissue adequate to support their respiratory requirements without the use of supplementary gas exchange organs were the reptiles. Reptiles evolved lungs that allowed them to live entirely on land, without relying on gills or other supplementary methods like moist skin, which amphibians depend on. This made reptiles the first group to achieve respiratory independence with lung tissue alone.
