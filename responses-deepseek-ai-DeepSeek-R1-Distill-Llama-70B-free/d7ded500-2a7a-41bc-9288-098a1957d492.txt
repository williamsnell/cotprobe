Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the markup in dollars for a dress. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the dress sells for $50.00, and the markup is 40% based on the selling price. Wait, I remember that markup can be calculated in two ways: based on cost or based on selling price. Oh right, this one is based on the selling price, which is different from the usual cost-based markup I've seen before.

So, the formula for markup when it's based on selling price is: Markup = (Markup Percentage) × (Selling Price). Or wait, no, maybe I should think about it differently. Let me think. The selling price is made up of the cost plus the markup. So if the markup is 40% of the selling price, that means the cost is 60% of the selling price because 100% - 40% = 60%.

Wait, that makes sense. So, if the selling price is $50, the cost would be 60% of $50. Let me calculate that. 60% of 50 is 0.6 * 50 = $30. So the cost is $30. Then, the markup is the selling price minus the cost. So $50 minus $30 equals $20. So the markup is $20.

Wait, let me double-check. Another way to think about it is that the markup is 40% of the selling price. So 40% of 50 is 0.4 * 50 = $20. Oh, right, that's another way to get the same answer. So that's consistent.

Looking at the options, option G is $20.00. So the answer should be G, right? But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Sometimes, markup can be calculated based on cost, where Markup = (Markup%) × Cost. But in this problem, it's based on selling price, so that's why we use 40% of $50.

Wait, if the markup was based on cost, the calculation would be different. Let's see, how would that work? Suppose the markup is 40% on cost. Then selling price would be cost plus 40% of cost, which is cost * 1.4. So SP = 1.4 * cost. Then cost would be SP / 1.4. So 50 / 1.4 is approximately 35.71, and markup would be 50 - 35.71 = ~14.29. But that's not the case here because the problem states the markup is 40% based on selling price, not cost. So I can safely stick with the $20 answer.

So the correct markup is $20.00, which is option G.
</think>

The selling price of the dress is $50.00, and the markup is 40% based on the selling price. To find the markup in dollars:

1. **Markup Percentage**: 40% of the selling price.
2. **Calculation**: \( 0.4 \times 50 = 20 \).
3. **Markup in Dollars**: $20.00.

This corresponds to option G.

G: $20.00

Answer: G
