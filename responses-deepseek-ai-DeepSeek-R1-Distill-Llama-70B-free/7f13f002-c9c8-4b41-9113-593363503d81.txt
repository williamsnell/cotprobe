Okay, so I have this question about duties corresponding to rights related to goods and services. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which option is an example where a duty corresponds to a right to goods and services. I remember that in ethics, especially in rights theory, rights and duties are often correlated. So, if someone has a right, someone else has a duty related to that right.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: John's duty to return Mary's car that he borrowed. So Mary lent her car to John, and now he must return it. This sounds like a contractual obligation or a promise. When you borrow something, you have a duty to return it. So Mary has a right to get her car back. That fits because the right is about a specific good (the car), and the duty is to return it.

Option B: John's duty to allow Mary to pursue goals. This feels more like a duty related to her freedom or autonomy. It's about not interfering with her pursuing her values. I think this is more about negative rights, like the right to be left alone, rather than a right to a specific good or service.

Option C: John's duty not to harm Mary. That's a general duty, like a moral obligation not to cause harm. It's more about non-maleficence. But this doesn't directly relate to goods or services; it's more about personal safety or well-being.

Option D: John's duty not to commit suicide. Wait, that's a bit confusing. I thought duties are usually towards others. If John has a duty not to kill himself, is that a duty to himself or others? Maybe it's a duty to himself, but I'm not sure how this ties into a right to goods or services. It doesn't seem to fit because it's about self-harm rather than providing something to someone else.

So, focusing back on the question, it's about rights to goods and services. Goods are tangible items, so option A involves a tangible item (a car). Mary has a right to the car, so John has a duty to return it. That seems to fit perfectly.

Wait, could option B be about services? Services are intangible, like doing something for someone. But option B is about allowing Mary to pursue her goals, which is more about not interfering. That's not providing a service but rather respecting her autonomy.

So the correct answer should be option A.

The correct answer is A. John's duty to return the car he borrowed from Mary corresponds to her right to the good (the car). This is a specific obligation tied to a tangible item, fitting the criteria of a duty related to a right to goods and services.
