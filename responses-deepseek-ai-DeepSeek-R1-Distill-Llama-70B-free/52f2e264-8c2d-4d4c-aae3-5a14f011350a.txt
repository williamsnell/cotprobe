Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of methane. Hmm, I remember that the standard enthalpy change of reaction, ∆H°_r, is calculated using the standard enthalpies of formation of the products and reactants. The formula is ∆H°_r = Σ ∆H°f(products) - Σ ∆H°f(reactants).

The reaction given is CH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l). I need to find the ∆H°f for each substance involved. Oh wait, the problem provides the values: for CH4 it's -17.89 kcal/mol, O2 is 0 (since it's in its standard form), CO2 is -94.05, and H2O(l) is -68.32 each. But wait, there's two moles of H2O, so I'll have to multiply that by 2.

Let me write this down step by step. The products are CO2 and H2O. So their combined ∆H°f is (-94.05) + 2*(-68.32). Let me calculate that: 94.05 plus (2 * 68.32). Wait, wait, no, because the signs matter. Since each is negative, adding them will make it more negative. 

Wait, let me compute each part. For the products: CO2 is -94.05, and 2 moles of H2O would be 2*(-68.32) = -136.64. So adding those together: -94.05 + (-136.64) = -230.69 kcal.

Now the reactants: the reactants are CH4 and O2. CH4's ∆H°f is -17.89, and O2 is 0. So the sum for reactants is -17.89 + (2*0) = -17.89 kcal.

So applying the formula: ∆H°_r = (products) - (reactants). That would be (-230.69) - (-17.89) = -230.69 +17.89 = -212.8 kcal.

Wait, but let me double-check that. Because the formula is sum of products minus sum of reactants. So products sum is -230.69, reactants sum is -17.89. So subtracting, it's -230.69 - (-17.89) = -230.69 +17.89 = -212.8. Yeah, that seems right.

Looking at the options, option H is -212.8 Kcal/mole. So the correct answer should be H.

To calculate the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of methane, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta H^\circ_r = \Sigma \Delta H^\circ_f(\text{products}) - \Sigma \Delta H^\circ_f(\text{reactants})
\]

The balanced reaction is:

\[
\text{CH}_4(g) + 2\text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow \text{CO}_2(g) + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}(l)
\]

The given standard enthalpies of formation (\(\Delta H^\circ_f\)) are:
- \(\Delta H^\circ_f(\text{CH}_4) = -17.89 \, \text{kcal/mol}\),
- \(\Delta H^\circ_f(\text{O}_2) = 0 \, \text{kcal/mol}\),
- \(\Delta H^\circ_f(\text{CO}_2) = -94.05 \, \text{kcal/mol}\),
- \(\Delta H^\circ_f(\text{H}_2\text{O}(l)) = -68.32 \, \text{kcal/mol}\).

**Step 1: Calculate the total \(\Delta H^\circ_f\) for the products.**
\[
\Delta H^\circ_f(\text{products}) = \Delta H^\circ_f(\text{CO}_2) + 2 \cdot \Delta H^\circ_f(\text{H}_2\text{O}(l))
\]
\[
\Delta H^\circ_f(\text{products}) = -94.05 + 2(-68.32) = -94.05 - 136.64 = -230.69 \, \text{kcal}.
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total \(\Delta H^\circ_f\) for the reactants.**
\[
\Delta H^\circ_f(\text{reactants}) = \Delta H^\circ_f(\text{CH}_4) + 2 \cdot \Delta H^\circ_f(\text{O}_2)
\]
\[
\Delta H^\circ_f(\text{reactants}) = -17.89 + 2(0) = -17.89 \, \text{kcal}.
\]

**Step 3: Apply the formula for \(\Delta H^\circ_r\).**
\[
\Delta H^\circ_r = \Delta H^\circ_f(\text{products}) - \Delta H^\circ_f(\text{reactants})
\]
\[
\Delta H^\circ_r = -230.69 - (-17.89) = -230.69 + 17.89 = -212.8 \, \text{kcal}.
\]

Thus, the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of methane is \(-212.8 \, \text{kcal/mol}\).

The correct answer is **H**.
