Okay, so I've got this problem here about Finch Analysts and their computer terminal. I need to figure out when they should replace it. Hmm, right, the question is about economics of replacement, probably involving cost-benefit analysis over time. 

Alright, let's break down the problem. The terminal's replacement cost is $250. The average repair cost is $50 per repair. The number of breakdowns over t years is t^(4/3). So, I think the idea is to find the point in time where the total cost of repairs equals the replacement cost. That point is when it makes sense to replace the terminal because keeping it longer would cost more in repairs than just buying a new one.

So, the total repair cost would be the number of breakdowns multiplied by the cost per repair. The number of breakdowns is t^(4/3), and each repair is $50. So, total repair cost is 50 * t^(4/3).

We need to find the time t when this total repair cost equals the replacement cost of $250. So, setting up the equation: 50 * t^(4/3) = 250.

Let me write that down: 50 t^(4/3) = 250. 

To solve for t, I can divide both sides by 50 first. That gives t^(4/3) = 5. 

Wait, 250 divided by 50 is 5, yeah. So t^(4/3) = 5.

Now, to solve for t, I need to get rid of the exponent 4/3. I remember that raising both sides to the reciprocal power will do that. The reciprocal of 4/3 is 3/4. So, if I raise both sides to the 3/4 power, I can solve for t.

So, (t^(4/3))^(3/4) = 5^(3/4). Simplifying the left side, the exponents multiply: (4/3)*(3/4) = 1, so t = 5^(3/4).

Now, what is 5 raised to the 3/4 power? Hmm, 5^(1/4) is the fourth root of 5, and then raising that to the 3rd power. Alternatively, I can think of it as 5^(0.75).

Let me calculate that. I remember that 5^0.5 is sqrt(5) ≈ 2.236. 5^0.75 is 5^(3/4) which is the same as (5^(1/4))^3. Alternatively, using logarithms or a calculator approach.

Wait, maybe I can approximate it. Let's see: the fourth root of 5 is approximately what? Let me think. 5^(1/4) is e^( (1/4) ln5 ). Ln5 is about 1.6094, so 1/4 of that is around 0.40235. e^0.40235 is approximately 1.494. So 5^(1/4) ≈ 1.494. Then, 1.494 cubed is about (1.5)^3 = 3.375, but let me calculate more accurately.

1.494^3: Let's compute 1.494 *1.494 first. 1.494 * 1.494: 1.4*1.4 is 1.96, 0.094*1.4 is about 0.1316, and same for cross terms, so maybe around 2.23. Then multiply by 1.494 again. 2.23 *1.494 is approximately 3.34. So 5^(3/4) is about 3.34.

Wait, but maybe I should use a more precise method. Alternatively, using exponents on a calculator. Let's think: 5^(0.75) can be calculated as e^(0.75 * ln5).

Ln5 is approximately 1.60944. So 0.75 * 1.60944 is 1.20708. Now, e^1.20708 is about 3.34. Because e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.2 is around 3.32. So yes, 3.34.

So t ≈ 3.34 years. Wait, but wait, looking at the options, the closest one is H:3.8 years, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. The number of breakdowns is t^(4/3), and each repair is $50. So the total cost is 50*(t^(4/3)).

So set 50 t^(4/3) = 250 → t^(4/3) =5 → t=5^(3/4)= approx 3.34 years.

Looking at the options, the closest is H:3.8, but that's not exact. Wait, the options don't have 3.34, but perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe the problem considers the total cost including the initial cost. Or is it just the repair costs versus the replacement cost?

In some replacement problems, the model is when the sum of depreciation and maintenance costs equals the replacement cost. But here, I think it's simpler: when the total repair costs equal the replacement cost, it's time to replace.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects to find when the total cost (repairs) equals the replacement cost, so when cumulative repairs equal $250.

So yeah, t would be approximately 3.34 years. But the options don't have that. Wait, let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: 8.5 years

B:7.6

C:11.2

D:4

E:6.4

F:12.5

G:9

H:3.8

I:10

J:5.

So the closest to 3.34 is H:3.8. But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me re-calculate 5^(3/4) more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express 5^(3/4) as (5^(1/4))^3. Let me compute 5^(1/4) accurately.

Another approach: since 5^(3/4) is the same as the square root of 5^(3/2). Because 3/4 is half of 3/2.

Wait, 5^(3/2) is sqrt(5^3). 5^3 is 125, sqrt(125) is about 11.1803. Then sqrt(11.1803) is approximately 3.337.

So 5^(3/4) is approximately 3.337. So t≈3.337 years, which is about 3.34 years. So 3.34 is closest to option H:3.8. But wait, that's a difference of about 0.46 years, which is about 5.5 months. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong.

Wait a second, perhaps I set up the equation incorrectly. Let me re-read the question.

Ah! Wait, the number of breakdowns is t^(4/3). So for t years, the number of breakdowns is t^(4/3), each costing $50. So total repair cost is 50*(t^(4/3)). We set that equal to the replacement cost of $250.

So 50 t^(4/3) = 250 → t^(4/3)=5 → t=5^(3/4) ≈3.34. So none of the options are exactly 3.34. The closest is H:3.8.

But wait, perhaps I should check if the question is considering the average cost per year, and perhaps the optimal time is when the derivative of the total cost equals the replacement cost's derivative. Wait, no, the problem is probably simpler, as replacement cost is a one-time payment, and repair costs are ongoing. But perhaps the correct approach is to find when the total repair cost reaches $250, which would be at approximately 3.34 years.

Looking at the options, the closest is H:3.8. But perhaps I made a mistake in calculations. Alternatively, perhaps the question is when the total repair cost equals the replacement cost plus the initial cost. Wait, but the initial cost isn't mentioned. The problem says the replacement cost is $250, so I think the initial installation is a sunk cost and not part of the current decision.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the present value of the costs, but the question doesn't mention anything about discount rates or interest, so I think it's just a simple break-even analysis.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the equation.

t^(4/3) =5 → t=5^(3/4)= (5^(1/4))^3.

5^(1/4) is approximately 1.495, so 1.495^3= approx 3.34.

Hmm, so 3.34 years is the time when repair costs equal the replacement cost.

Looking at the options, the closest is H:3.8 years. But why is the exact value not among the options? Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the total cost including the initial installation. Wait, but the problem states that the replacement cost is $250. So perhaps the initial installation is $250, and when the repair costs add up to that, you replace it.

So yes, that's how I set it up, leading to t≈3.34 years.

Wait, but maybe I should double-check the exponent calculation. Let me compute 3.34^(4/3) to see if it equals 5.

3.34^(1/3) is approximately 1.496, then 1.496^4 is (1.496^2)^2. 1.496^2 is about 2.238, then squared is about 5. So yes, 3.34^(4/3) is 5. So the calculation seems correct.

So the answer should be approximately 3.34 years, but that's not one of the options. Wait, looking back, option H is 3.8. So perhaps the intended answer is H. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering the average annual cost and looking for when it's optimal to replace. Oh, perhaps it's a different approach. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the total cost of ownership over t years, which includes the initial cost plus repair costs, and finding when the derivative of that with respect to t equals zero. But that would be a more complex approach, and I'm not sure if the question expects that.

Wait, initial cost is $250, and repair costs are 50*(t^(4/3)). So total cost C(t) =250 + 50 t^(4/3). But wait, no, that's not right because when you replace the terminal, you pay another $250. So perhaps the approach is different.

Alternatively, the problem might be considering the optimal replacement time as when the marginal cost of keeping the old terminal equals the cost of the new one. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find when the total repair cost since installation equals the replacement cost. So that would be when 50 t^(4/3) = 250 → t≈3.34, as before.

Given that, the closest option is H:3.8 years, but perhaps the exact value is not there, but maybe I made a miscalculation. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 5^(3/4) more accurately.

Let me use a calculator-like approach. Let's compute 5^(3/4):

First, let's find ln(5) ≈1.60944.

Multiply by 3/4: 1.60944 * 0.75 =1.20708.

Now, e^1.20708.

We know that e^1.2 =3.3201, e^0.00708≈1.0071. So 3.3201 *1.0071≈3.340. So yes, t≈3.34.

So the correct time is approximately 3.34 years, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made an error in the setup.

Wait, let me read the question again carefully. It says, "the number of breakdowns will be about t^4/3." So, number of breakdowns is t^(4/3). So, yes, that's correct. So the setup seems right.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the cumulative repair cost being greater than the replacement cost, so the time when it's just about to exceed. So at t=3.34, it's exactly equal.

Looking at the options, the closest is H:3.8, but that's 0.46 years higher. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the number of breakdowns is an average, so maybe the exact value isn't critical, but perhaps the answer is intended to be around 3.8.

Alternatively, perhaps the exponent in the number of breakdowns is 4/3 of t, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should do the calculation more precisely. Let me compute 3.8^(4/3).

3.8^(1/3) is approximately 1.56, because 1.56^3 is about 3.796. So 3.8^(4/3) = (3.8^(1/3))^4 ≈1.56^4.

1.56^2 is 2.4336, then squared again is about 5.919. So 3.8^(4/3)=5.919. So 50*5.919=296.96$, which is more than 250. So at t=3.8, the repair cost would have exceeded 250.

But we're looking for when it equals 250, which is at t=3.34. So perhaps the problem expects us to choose the closest option, which is H:3.8, but it's actually beyond the break-even point.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Wait, is the number of breakdowns t^(4/3) or t^(4)/3? The question says "t^4/3", which would be t^(4/3). So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the average cost per year, and when that equals some other factor. But that seems more complicated, and the problem doesn't provide information on discount rates or anything like that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is looking for when the total repair cost equals the replacement cost, which is exactly what I did. So the correct time is approximately 3.34 years, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is H:3.8. Or maybe I've made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the equation is correct. Let me set it up again.

Total repair cost = number of breakdowns * cost per repair = t^(4/3) *50.

Set equal to replacement cost: 50 t^(4/3) = 250.

Divide both sides by 50: t^(4/3)=5.

Raise both sides to 3/4: t =5^(3/4)=3.34.

So that's correct. Therefore, the answer isn't exactly among the options, but the closest is H:3.8. Alternatively, perhaps the intended approach was to round up to the next whole number, but 3.34 is closer to 3 than 4. So perhaps the intended answer is H, but I'm not fully confident.

Wait, looking at the options, H is 3.8, which is higher than 3.34. Maybe the problem expects to round to one decimal place, but 3.34 would be 3.3, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 5^(3/4). Let me compute it more accurately using logarithms.

Compute 5^(3/4):

Take natural log: ln(5)=1.60944.

Multiply by 3/4:1.60944 *0.75=1.20708.

Now, compute e^1.20708.

We know that e^1=2.71828, e^1.2=3.3201, and e^1.20708 is slightly higher.

Let me compute the Taylor series around 1.2:

Let x=1.20708=1.2 +0.00708.

e^(1.2 +0.00708)=e^1.2 * e^0.00708.

e^0.00708≈1 +0.00708 + (0.00708)^2/2.

0.00708^2≈0.000050, so divided by 2 is 0.000025. So e^0.00708≈1.00708 +0.000025≈1.007105.

So e^1.20708≈3.3201 *1.007105≈3.3201 *1.0071.

Calculate 3.3201 *1.0071:

3 *1.0071=3.0213.

0.3201*1.0071≈0.3225.

So total≈3.0213 +0.3225=3.3438.

So t≈3.344 years.

So 3.344 is approximately 3.34, which is not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is H:3.8, but I'm not sure why. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the average annual repair cost, and when that equals the annual equivalent of the replacement cost. But that would involve more complex calculations, including interest rates, which aren't provided, so I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider that each year, the number of breakdowns increases, so the optimal time is when the derivative of the total repair cost equals the replacement cost. But that approach doesn't make much sense because the replacement cost is a one-time expense.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the total repair cost as a function and find the minimum point where replacement is optimal, but that would involve calculus and minimizing the total cost function, which might include the initial cost.

Wait, let me think again. The total cost if you keep the terminal for t years is the initial cost plus repair costs. But the initial cost is a sunk cost once the terminal is installed. So the decision to replace would be based on whether the repair costs exceed the replacement cost. So the correct approach is when the cumulative repair costs equal the replacement cost, which is the approach I took.

Given that, I think the correct answer isn't exactly among the options, but the closest is H:3.8. However, perhaps I should check if I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the problem is considering
