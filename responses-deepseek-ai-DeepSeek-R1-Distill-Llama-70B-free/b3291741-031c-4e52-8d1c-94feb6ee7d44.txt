Okay, so I've got this question about drafts and discounting, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. 

The question states: A draft for $800, due in 3 months and bearing interest at 4 and a half percent, was discounted 60 days before it was due. The discount rate was 5%. We're supposed to find the proceeds.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these banking terms, but I'll try to recall. A draft is like a bill of exchange, right? So it's a written order to pay a certain amount. The face value is $800, due in 3 months, so that's 90 days from the date of issue, I think. 

Wait, but the draft was discounted 60 days before it was due. So the time from discounting to the due date is 60 days. Which means the bank is essentially buying this draft before it's due, paying the present value, and the business gets the money now. 

The interest on the draft is at 4.5%, which is the nominal rate. But when discounting, I think we might have to calculate the discount based on the time remaining until maturity. 

So the formula I remember for discounting a bill is something like: 

Proceeds = Face Value - (Face Value × Rate × Time)

Or wait, maybe it's the present value. Alternatively, using the simple interest formula. Because for discounting bills, simple interest is usually applied. 

Wait, but the discount rate is given as 5%. So the bank is charging 5% on the face value for the period. Or is it based on the time? Let me think.

The formula for the discount is typically:

Discount = (Face Value × Rate × Time) / 100

But sometimes, it's expressed as:

Proceeds = Face Value × (1 - (Rate × Time)/100)

Wait, but the time here is in years, right? Because interest rates are annual. So 60 days is 60/365 years.

So let's break it down.

Face Value (F) = $800

Rate (r) = 5% per annum.

Time (t) = 60 days. So in years, that's 60/365 ≈ 0.1644 years.

So discount = F × r × t = 800 × 0.05 × (60/365)

Let me compute that.

First, 800 * 0.05 is 40. Then 40 * (60/365) = 40 * (0.1644) ≈ 6.576. So discount is approximately $6.576.

Therefore, the proceeds would be Face Value minus discount: 800 - 6.576 = approximately 793.424. Wait, but that's not matching any of the options given.

Wait a minute, maybe I'm mixing up the interest calculation. Because the draft itself has an interest rate of 4.5%, but the discounting is done at 5%. So perhaps the 4.5% is the interest that would have been earned if the draft wasn't discounted, and the 5% is the discount rate applied by the bank.

Alternatively, maybe the interest on the draft is the effective rate, and the discount is calculated based on the bank's rate.

Wait, perhaps another approach. When a bill is discounted, the proceeds are calculated using the formula:

Proceeds = Face Value × (1 - (discount rate × time))

But time must be in years. So 60 days is 60/365 ≈ 0.16438.

So discount rate is 5%, so 0.05. So 0.05 * 0.16438 ≈ 0.008219.

So proceeds = 800 * (1 - 0.008219) = 800 * 0.991781 ≈ 792.525.

Hmm, that's still not matching the options. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the interest on the draft is being considered as well. Because the draft itself is paying 4.5% interest. So perhaps the present value is calculated considering both the discount rate and the draft's interest.

Wait, but in discounting a bill, I think the discount rate is applied to the face value. So maybe the 4.5% is the interest that the drawer would have earned if they waited until maturity, but since they're discounting it early, they get the present value based on the discount rate.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest on the draft isn't directly relevant here because the discounting is done at a different rate.

Wait, perhaps the formula is: Proceeds = Face Value / (1 + (rate × time)).

Wait, because discounting would be like taking the present value. So if the face value is $800 due in 60 days (which is 60/365 years) at a discount rate of 5%, then:

PV = FV / (1 + rt)

So rt is 0.05 * (60/365) ≈ 0.008219.

So PV = 800 / (1.008219) ≈ ?

Let me calculate that. 1.008219 is approximately 1.008219. So 800 divided by that.

Calculating 800 / 1.008219.

Well, 1.008219 times 792 is approximately 800? Let's see: 792 * 1.008219 = 792 * 1 = 792, 792 * 0.008219 ≈ 6.514. So 792 +6.514 ≈ 798.514. Hmm, that's less than 800.

Wait, maybe I should do it more accurately. Alternatively, using a calculator approach.

Approximately, 1.008219 → 0.7925 when taking reciprocal? Because 1/1.008219 ≈ 0.9918.

Wait, no, wait: 1/(1 + 0.05*(60/365)) = 1/(1.008219) ≈ 0.99178.

So PV = 800 * 0.99178 ≈ 792.54.

Again, same as before, but that's not matching any options.

Wait, looking at the options, the closest might be J: $790.26, but that's lower than my calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the time is 90 days minus 60 days already passed. Wait, no—the draft is due in 3 months (90 days) from issue, but it's discounted 60 days before due date. So the time remaining is 60 days, which is 60/365.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it differently. Maybe the interest on the draft is 4.5%, so the effective amount due is more than $800 because of the interest. But the discounting is done at 5%, which is a higher rate, so the proceeds would be less than the face plus interest.

Wait, maybe the face value already includes interest. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternative approach: Let's calculate the interest on the draft first. The draft is due in 90 days, bearing 4.5% interest. So the interest would be 800 * 4.5% * (90/365). 

So 4.5% is 0.045. 90/365 ≈ 0.24658.

So interest: 800 * 0.045 * 0.24658 ≈ 800 * 0.01109 ≈ 8.87.

So the total amount due at maturity is 800 + 8.87 ≈ 808.87.

But when discounting 60 days before maturity, the time is 60 days. So the present value would be calculated using the discount rate of 5% on this total amount.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the total amount the bank will receive is 808.87 in 60 days, so to find the present value, we discount it back 60 days at 5%.

So using present value formula: PV = FV / (1 + rt), where FV is 808.87, r is 5% or 0.05, t is 60/365 ≈ 0.16438.

So rt = 0.05 * 0.16438 ≈ 0.008219.

So denominator is 1.008219.

So PV = 808.87 / 1.008219 ≈ ?

Calculating that: Let's approximate.

808.87 ÷ 1.008219.

Well, 1.008219 * 800 = 806.5952.

Wait, 1.008219 * 800 = 806.5952.

But we have 808.87, so the difference is 808.87 - 806.5952 = 2.2748.

So 2.2748 / 1.008219 ≈ approximately 2.258.

So total would be 800 + 2.258 ≈ 802.258.

Wait, so approximately $802.26. Looking at the options, option C is $802.26.

That makes sense. So the proceeds would be $802.26, which is option C.

Wait, but wait a minute—did I compute that correctly? Let me double-check the steps.

1. Calculate interest on the draft: 4.5% for 90 days on $800.

Interest = 800 * 0.045 * (90/365).

Compute 90/365 = 0.246575.

0.045 * 0.246575 ≈ 0.01109.

800 * 0.01109 ≈ 8.873. So total amount due is 808.873.

2. Now, discount this amount back 60 days at 5%.

Time in years: 60/365 ≈ 0.16438.

Discount rate per period: 5% per annum.

So the present value is 808.873 / (1 + 0.05 * 0.16438).

Compute denominator: 0.05 * 0.16438 = 0.008219. So 1 + 0.008219 = 1.008219.

So PV = 808.873 / 1.008219.

Let me compute this more precisely.

Calculating 808.873 ÷ 1.008219.

Let me think: 1.008219 × 802 = ?

1.008219 * 800 = 806.595

1.008219 * 2 = 2.016438

So 1.008219 * 802 = 806.595 + 2.016438 = 808.611438.

Which is very close to 808.873. So 1.008219 * 802 ≈ 808.611.

The difference between 808.873 and 808.611 is 0.262.

So 0.262 / 1.008219 ≈ 0.26.

So total would be 802 + 0.26 ≈ 802.26. So yes, that gives $802.26, which is option C.

So the correct answer would be option C: $802.26.

To determine the proceeds from discounting the draft, we need to calculate the present value of the draft, considering the discount rate and the time remaining until maturity. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Face Value and Interest Calculation**:  
   The draft has a face value of $800 and bears interest at 4.5% per annum. Since the draft is due in 3 months (90 days), the interest accrued on the draft is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 800 \times 0.045 \times \frac{90}{365} \approx 8.87
   \]  
   Therefore, the total amount due at maturity is:  
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = 800 + 8.87 = 808.87
   \]

2. **Discounting the Draft**:  
   The draft is discounted 60 days before maturity. The discount rate is 5% per annum, and the time remaining is:  
   \[
   t = \frac{60}{365} \approx 0.1644 \, \text{years}
   \]  
   The discount factor is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Discount Factor} = 1 + (0.05 \times 0.1644) \approx 1.008219
   \]  
   The present value (proceeds) is then:  
   \[
   \text{Proceeds} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Discount Factor}} = \frac{808.87}{1.008219} \approx 802.26
   \]

3. **Final Answer**:  
   The proceeds from discounting the draft are approximately **$802.26**, which corresponds to **option C**.

**Answer: C**
