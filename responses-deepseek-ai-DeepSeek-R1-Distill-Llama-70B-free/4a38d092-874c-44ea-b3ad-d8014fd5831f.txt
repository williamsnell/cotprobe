Question:

A state legislature enacts a statute prohibiting the sale of contraceptive devices to married persons. This state statute prohibits the use of contraceptive devices by married persons. A physician who practices in the state brings suit in federal court challenging the constitutionality of the state contraceptive statute. The physician attacks the validity of the statute on the grounds that it prevents him from giving professional advice concerning the use of contraceptives to three patients, all of whom are married, whose condition of health might be endangered by child bearing. The plaintiff is likely

Options:

A: not to have standing.
B: to have standing.
C: to have standing, but only if the patients also sue
D: not to have standing jus tertii.
E: not to have standing, unless the patients join the lawsuit
F: not to have standing, unless he can prove the health risk
G: not to have standing, because the law does not directly affect him
H: to have standing jus tertii.
I: to have standing, but only if he can prove the health risk
J: to have standing, but not on behalf of his patients

Okay, so I'm looking at this question about standing in a constitutional law context. Hmm, I remember that standing is about whether a person has the legal right to bring a lawsuit. The basic idea is that the person must have suffered an injury in fact, that's concrete and particularized, and actual or imminent, not hypothetical. Also, the injury must be causally connected to the defendant's conduct, and it must be likely that a favorable decision will redress the injury.

The question is about a state statute that prohibits the sale of contraceptive devices to married persons and also prohibits their use. A physician is challenging this in federal court. He's saying that the statute prevents him from giving professional advice about contraceptives to his married patients, whose health could be endangered by childbearing.

Wait, so the physician is the plaintiff here. I need to figure out if he has standing. Let me break it down.

First, does the physician have an injury? Well, he claims that the statute stops him from giving advice. But does that mean he's directly affected? Or is he trying to assert the rights of his patients?

I remember that in some cases, like when a doctor is prosecuted for giving advice, they can have standing because the law affects their ability to practice medicine. Oh, right! There's a Supreme Court case where a doctor challenged a law criminalizing abortion because it affected his practice. I think that case was United States v. Vuitch, but maybe more relevant is the case of Griswold v. Connecticut, where a physician challenged a law prohibiting contraceptives. Wait, no, in Griswold, it was a challenge to a law that made it a crime to use contraceptives, and the Supreme Court held that there's a right to marital privacy. But that was a challenge by individuals, not a doctor.

Wait another case, maybe Eisenstadt v. Baird? No, that was about access to contraceptives for unmarried people. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting a bit off track. The key issue is whether the physician has standing. So, the physician is arguing that the statute prevents him from giving advice. So does that give him standing?

I think that when a statute imposes a criminal penalty on someone for advising others, that person can have standing. Because the threat of prosecution would cause them to cease the activity, thus causing an injury. But in this case, the statute prohibits the sale and use, but does it penalize the physician for giving advice? Or is the physician at risk of prosecution for giving such advice?

Wait, the question says the statute prohibits the sale and use of contraceptives. So perhaps the physician isn't directly prohibited from giving advice, but his patients are prohibited from using them. So the physician's ability to give advice is impacted because the patients can't legally use the contraceptives. But is that enough for standing?

Wait, but the physician isn't facing prosecution himself. Unless the statute also prohibits assisting in the use, like giving advice. If the statute doesn't penalize the physician for giving advice, then he might not have standing in his own right. Unless he's being restricted in his practice.

Wait, the question says the statute prohibits sale and use, but the physician is saying he's prevented from giving professional advice. So perhaps the physician is at risk if he provides such advice, but the question isn't clear on that. Alternatively, maybe his patients are the ones affected, and he's trying to assert their rights.

In the case of Singleton v. Wulff, the Supreme Court held that a physician has standing to challenge a law that restricts Medicaid payments for abortions because it affects their practice and their relationship with patients. So in that case, the physicians had standing because the law impacted their professional activities.

Similarly, in this question, the physician is arguing that the law prevents him from giving advice, which is part of his practice. So he might have standing based on that impact on his professional activities.

Wait, but Singleton v. Wulff was about third-party standing. Let me think. No, Singleton was more about the physicians' own rights, not third-party. Wait, no, Singleton allowed the physicians to have standing on behalf of their patients because the law affected their ability to provide certain services. So that's third-party standing.

But wait, third-party standing is when a plaintiff asserts the rights of someone else, typically when the third party is unable to assert their own rights. So if the physician is bringing the suit on behalf of his patients, that's third-party standing.

But does the physician have standing in his own right, or is he seeking third-party standing?

In this question, the physician is attacking the statute on the grounds that it prevents him from giving advice. So that's his own injury, not just asserting his patients' rights.

Wait, but the statute prohibits the sale and use. So the patients could be prosecuted for using contraceptives. But the physician isn't necessarily at risk unless the statute also prohibits aiding and abetting, or giving advice.

Alternatively, the physician's injury is that he can't provide the advice he thinks is medically necessary. That could be an injury in itself, impacting his professional judgment and practice.

So if the statute restricts his ability to give advice, that's a direct injury to him as a professional. So he would have standing to challenge it on his own behalf.

Alternatively, if the statute doesn't directly affect him, but affects his patients, then he might need third-party standing. But third-party standing is limited. The Supreme Court requires that the plaintiff demonstrate a close relationship with the third party and that the third party is unable to assert their own rights.

In this case, the patients are married persons whose health might be endangered. Are they able to assert their own rights? If the physician is their doctor, perhaps they could. But the question is whether the physician can assert their rights.

Wait, but the question says the physician is challenging the statute because it prevents him from giving advice to his patients. So he's asserting his own right to provide medical advice, not the patients' rights. So that would be standing in his own right, not third-party standing.

So, in that case, he would have standing because the statute affects his ability to practice medicine, providing advice to his patients.

Wait, but if the statute only prohibits the sale and use, and not the giving of advice, then the physician isn't directly prohibited from giving advice. So perhaps he's not at risk of prosecution. But if he gives advice that leads to the use of contraceptives, could he be charged with aiding and abetting? If the statute doesn't explicitly prohibit that, then maybe he's not directly affected.

But the question says he's challenging the statute because it prevents him from giving advice. So perhaps he's concerned that if he advises, he's in violation of the law. Or perhaps the existence of the law chills his ability to give such advice.

Wait, in the past, the Supreme Court has held that a plaintiff can have standing if they can show that their conduct is chilled by the existence of a statute, even if they haven't been prosecuted yet. For example, in cases where a statute's presence causes a person to refrain from constitutionally protected speech.

So if the physician feels that the statute prohibits him from giving advice, even if he hasn't been prosecuted, he might have standing based on the chilling effect. But does that apply here?

Alternatively, maybe the physician is a licensed medical professional, and the state's statute is making it impossible for him to provide medical advice, thereby affecting his practice. That could be an injury sufficient for standing.

So, considering that, the physician would have standing because the statute directly impacts his ability to practice medicine as he sees fit.

Looking back at the options:

Option B: to have standing.

Option J: to have standing, but not on behalf of his patients.

Wait, if he's asserting his own injury, then he doesn't need third-party standing, so J says he can't bring it on behalf of the patients. But the question is about whether he has standing at all.

Alternatively, option H is about standing jus tertii, which is third-party standing, but if he's asserting his own injury, he doesn't need that.

So the answer would be B: to have standing.

Wait, but let me think again. Another case comes to mind: Griswold v. Connecticut. In that case, a physician and others were prosecuted under a statute that prohibited the use of contraceptives. The Supreme Court held that the statute violated the right to marital privacy. But wait, in that case, the plaintiffs included individuals who were prosecuted, so they had standing. But in our question, the physician isn't prosecuted but is prevented from giving advice. So perhaps it's similar to cases where a professional is affected by a law that impacts their clients.

In the case of Pierce v. Society of Sisters, the Supreme Court struck down a law requiring children to attend public schools, affecting private schools. The schools had standing because the law would reduce their enrollment. Similarly, if a law affects a professional's ability to practice, they have standing.

So in this scenario, the physician's practice is being impacted, so he has standing.

So the correct answer is B: to have standing.
</think>

The question revolves around whether a physician has standing to challenge a state statute prohibiting the sale and use of contraceptive devices to married persons. The physician argues that the statute prevents him from giving professional advice to his married patients, whose health might be endangered by childbearing.

Standing requires an injury in fact that is concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent, causally connected to the challenged conduct, and likely to be redressed by a favorable decision. In this case, the physician claims the statute impacts his ability to provide medical advice, which is part of his professional practice. This constitutes a direct injury, as the statute restricts his professional judgment and ability to advise patients.

The physician is not merely asserting the rights of his patients (third-party standing) but is challenging the statute based on its direct effect on his practice. This aligns with precedents like *Singleton v. Wulff*, where physicians were held to have standing because a law affected their professional activities. Similarly, the chilling effect of the statute on the physician's ability to provide advice could also support standing, as seen in cases where statutes chill constitutionally protected conduct.

Given that the physician's injury is based on the statute's impact on his professional practice, he has standing in his own right. There is no need for third-party standing or additional requirements like the patients joining the lawsuit or proving the health risk. Therefore, the physician is likely to have standing.
