Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the annual interest rate for a bedroom set purchased on an installment plan. Hmm, let's break it down step by step. 

The cash value of the set is $720. But instead of paying that all at once, you can pay in 18 monthly payments of $47.20 each. I need to find the annual interest rate for this plan. 

Wait, I remember this is related to installment loans and calculating the interest rate. I think it's something to do with the present value of an annuity. Oh right, the present value of the payments should equal the cash value, considering the interest rate.

So the formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity is P = PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r], where P is the present value, PMT is the monthly payment, r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of payments. 

In this case, P is $720, PMT is $47.20, and n is 18 months. I need to find r, the monthly rate, and then multiply by 12 to get the annual rate. 

But wait, I don't remember the exact formula off the top of my head. Let me make sure. Oh yes, that's the correct formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity. So plugging in the values:

720 = 47.20 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-18 ) / r ]

Hmm, solving for r here seems tricky because it's in the denominator and the exponent. I can't solve this algebraically easily. Maybe I can use trial and error with the given options to find which rate works. 

The options are all annual rates, so I'll need to try each as a monthly rate (by dividing by 12) and see which makes the equation hold true. 

Let me pick an option and test it. Let's try option B: 16.8% annual. So the monthly rate would be 16.8% /12 = 1.4% or 0.014.

Plugging into the formula:

PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ] = 47.20 * [ (1 - (1.014)^-18 ) / 0.014 ]

I'll calculate (1.014)^-18 first. Let me compute 1.014^18 to see what that is. Wait, no, because it's (1/(1.014)^18). Let me compute 1.014^18. Maybe using logarithms or approximate.

Alternatively, I can use a financial calculator approach. Alternatively, I can compute 1.014^18:

Let me compute step by step:

1.014^1 = 1.014
^2 = 1.014 * 1.014 ≈ 1.028196
^3 ≈ 1.028196 *1.014 ≈ 1.04285
^4 ≈ 1.04285 * 1.014 ≈ 1.0576
^5 ≈ 1.0576 *1.014 ≈ 1.0727
^6 ≈ 1.0727 *1.014 ≈ 1.0879
^7 ≈ 1.0879 *1.014 ≈ 1.1035
^8 ≈ 1.1035 *1.014 ≈ 1.1191
^9 ≈ 1.1191 *1.014 ≈ 1.1351
^10 ≈ 1.1351 *1.014 ≈ 1.1513
^11 ≈ 1.1513 *1.014 ≈ 1.1678
^12 ≈ 1.1678 *1.014 ≈ 1.1844
Wait, but I'm already at 12, and I need 18. Maybe a better approach is to note that 1.014^18 is approximately e^(0.014*18) using the approximation ln(1+r) ≈ r for small r. 0.014*18=0.252, so e^0.252 ≈ 1.286. But wait, that's an approximation. Alternatively, using a calculator more accurately, but since I can't, perhaps I should proceed with another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 1/(1.014)^18. Let me compute (1.014)^18:

But perhaps it's getting too complicated. Maybe I can try another option. Let's try option H: 18% annual rate. Monthly rate is 1.5% or 0.015.

Compute denominator first: (1 - (1.015)^-18 ) / 0.015

I'll compute (1.015)^18. Let me see:

1.015^18. Maybe compute it step by step.

But this might take time. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the rule of 72 or some approximation, but I'm not sure. Maybe I can compute (1.015)^12 which is about 1.195, then for another 6 months: (1.195)*(1.015)^6. (1.015)^6 is approx 1.0938. So 1.195 * 1.0938 ≈ 1.307. So (1.015)^18 ≈ 1.307. Therefore, 1/(1.015)^18 ≈ 0.764.

So the numerator (1 - 0.764) = 0.236. Divide by 0.015: 0.236 / 0.015 ≈ 15.73. 

Then, PMT is 47.20 * 15.73 ≈ 47.2 * 15.73. Let's calculate: 47 *15 is 705, 47 *0.73≈34.31 → total ≈739.31. But the present value is supposed to be 720. So 720 < 739, meaning the rate is higher than 18%? Because a higher rate would lower the present value.

Wait, what's the relationship between interest rate and present value? Higher interest rate lowers the present value because each payment is discounted more. So if 18% gives a PV of ~739, which is higher than 720, that means the actual rate must be higher than 18% to bring the PV down to 720.

So perhaps the correct rate is higher than 18%. Let's try option G: 20% annual. Monthly rate is 0.016666... (~1.6667%).

Compute (1.0166667)^-18. Let's compute (1.0166667)^18 first.

Hmm, 1.0166667 is 1 + 1/60. So (1 + 1/60)^60 ≈ e, but for 18 periods, perhaps we can approximate.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to compute (1.0166667)^18.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for present value again. Let me compute [ (1 - (1 + 0.0166667)^-18 ) / 0.0166667 ]

First, compute 1.0166667^18.

It's easier to compute ln(1.0166667) = approx 0.01653 (since ln(1+x) ≈x -x^2/2 + x^3/3..., so 0.0166667 - (0.0166667)^2/2 ≈ 0.0166667 - 0.0001389 ≈ 0.0165278. Multiply by 18: 0.0165278 *18 ≈ 0.29746. e^0.29746 ≈ 1.345 (since e^0.3 ≈ 1.34986). So 1.0166667^18 ≈ 1.345. Therefore, 1/(1.0166667^18) ≈ 0.738.

So numerator is 1 - 0.738 = 0.262. Dividing by 0.0166667 gives 0.262 / 0.0166667 ≈ 15.72. Multiply by PMT 47.20: 47.20 * 15.72 ≈ let's compute 47 *15=705, 47 *0.72≈33.84 → total 705+33.84=738.84. So the PV is about 738.84, which is still higher than 720. 

So the PV is still higher than 720, meaning the rate is higher than 20%? Because a higher rate would lower the present value further.

Wait, but wait, in my earlier calculation with 18%, the PV was about 739, with 20% it's 738.84? That doesn't make sense because 20% is a higher rate, so the PV should be lower. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait no, when I did 18% (monthly 1.5%), the PV came to approx 739.31. At 20% (1.6667% monthly), the PV came to 738.84, which is actually slightly lower than 739.31. But 720 is still lower than both. So perhaps the rate is higher than 20%? Let me try a higher option.

Looking at the options, the next higher is option C:24%, which is 2% monthly. Let's try that.

So r = 0.02.

Compute (1.02)^-18. Let's compute 1.02^18 first. Hmm, 1.02^10 is approx 1.219, 1.02^18 is 1.02^10 * 1.02^8. 1.02^8: let's compute step by step.

1.02^2 = 1.0404
^4 = (1.0404)^2 ≈ 1.0824
^8 = (1.0824)^2 ≈ 1.1718

So 1.02^18 = 1.219 * 1.1718 ≈ 1.429. So 1/(1.02)^18 ≈ 0.699.

So numerator is (1 - 0.699) = 0.301. Denominator is 0.02. So 0.301/0.02 = 15.05.

Then, PMT * this factor: 47.20 * 15.05 ≈ 47.2 *15 = 708, plus 47.2*0.05=2.36 → total 710.36. So PV is about 710, which is lower than 720. So the correct rate is between 20% and 24%, because at 20% the PV is 738.84, and at 24% it's 710.36. But 720 is in between.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me reorganize:

We have:

At 18% annual (1.5% monthly): PV ≈ 739.31

At 20% annual (1.6667%): PV ≈738.84

Wait, this seems off because 20% is higher than 18%, but the PV is lower, which makes sense. Wait, no, 739 is higher than 738.84. Oh wait, no, 739 is higher than 738.84, which doesn't make sense because a higher rate should lower the PV. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. When I calculated for 20% annual (1.6667% monthly), I got PV ≈738.84, which is lower than 739.31 at 18% annual. So that's correct because higher rate leads to lower PV.

But the target PV is 720. So let's try a rate higher than 20%. Next possible option is C:24%, which gives PV 710, which is lower than 720. So the correct rate is between 20% and 24%.

Looking at the options, the next possible higher rate is option G:20%, but that's already been tried. Then C is 24%. But perhaps another option is J:22.7% annual. Let me try that.

22.7% annual rate. Monthly rate is 22.7/12 ≈1.8917% or 0.018917.

Compute the present value factor:

(1 - (1.018917)^-18 ) / 0.018917

First compute (1.018917)^-18.

Let me compute 1.018917^18.

Hmm, perhaps using logarithms:

ln(1.018917) ≈ 0.0187.

Multiply by 18: 0.3366. e^0.3366 ≈ 1.4003. So 1.018917^18 ≈ 1.4003 → 1/1.4003 ≈ 0.714.

So numerator is 1 - 0.714 = 0.286.

Divide by 0.018917: 0.286 / 0.018917 ≈ 15.11.

Multiply by PMT 47.20: 47.20 *15.11 ≈ let's compute 47 *15=705, 47 *0.11≈5.17 → total ≈710.17. So PV≈710.17, which is lower than 720. So the rate is between 20% (738.84) and 22.7% (710.17). Wait, no, 22.7% gives a PV of ~710, which is lower than 720. So perhaps I need a rate lower than 22.7% but higher than 20%? Or maybe I made a mistake in the approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute more accurately. Let's try option J:22.7% annual, monthly rate ≈1.8917%.

Compute (1.018917)^18.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute (1.018917)^18 more accurately.

Let me compute step by step:

1.018917^1 = 1.018917

^2 ≈ 1.018917 * 1.018917 ≈ 1.0384

^3 ≈ 1.0384 * 1.018917 ≈ 1.0581

^4 ≈ 1.0581 *1.018917 ≈ 1.0782

^5 ≈ 1.0782 *1.018917 ≈ 1.0989

^6 ≈ 1.0989 *1.018917 ≈ 1.1203

^7 ≈ 1.1203 *1.018917 ≈ 1.1423

^8 ≈1.1423 *1.018917≈1.1650

^9≈1.1650 *1.018917≈1.1885

^10≈1.1885 *1.018917≈1.2129

^11≈1.2129 *1.018917≈1.2381

^12≈1.2381 *1.018917≈1.2641

^13≈1.2641 *1.018917≈1.2909

^14≈1.2909 *1.018917≈1.3186

^15≈1.3186 *1.018917≈1.3473

^16≈1.3473 *1.018917≈1.3769

^17≈1.3769 *1.018917≈1.4075

^18≈1.4075 *1.018917≈1.4393

So 1.018917^18 ≈1.4393. Therefore, 1/(1.018917^18)≈0.696.

So numerator is 1 - 0.696 =0.304.

Divide by 0.018917: 0.304 / 0.018917 ≈16.07.

Multiply by PMT 47.20: 47.20 *16.07 ≈ let's compute 47 *16=752, 47 *0.07≈3.29 → total ≈755.29. Wait, that can't be right because earlier with 20% it was 738. So this suggests that the PV is higher than 720, but that contradicts the previous calculation. I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of 1.018917^18. Because in my step-by-step, I reached 1.4393 at 18 months, which makes the present value factor for each payment as 0.696. So the numerator is 0.304, denominator 0.018917 → 0.304 / 0.018917 ≈16.07. Multiply by 47.20: 47.20 *16.07 = ?

Wait, 47 *16 is 752, 47 *0.07=3.29 → 752 +3.29=755.29. But that can't be right because 22.7% is higher than 20%, so the PV should be lower than 738.84. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute 1.018917^18.

Wait, perhaps I should use a better method. Let me try to compute 1.018917^18 using exponents.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the rule that (1 + r)^n = e^(n*ln(1+r)). 

So ln(1.018917) ≈0.0187.

n=18, so 18 *0.0187=0.3366.

e^0.3366≈1.4003. So (1.018917)^18≈1.4003. Therefore, 1/1.4003≈0.714.

So the present value factor is (1 - 0.714)/0.018917 = 0.286/0.018917≈15.11.

Then, 47.20 *15.11 = let's calculate:

47.20 *15 = 708.00

47.20 *0.11=5.192

Total: 708 +5.192=713.192 ≈713.19.

Wait, that's lower than 720. So at 22.7%, the PV is ~713, which is below 720. So the correct rate must be between 20% (PV≈738.84) and 22.7% (PV≈713.19).

So 720 is between 738.84 and 713.19. Therefore, the rate is between 20% and 22.7%.

Looking at the options, other choices in this range are H:18%, G:20%, and J:22.7%. Let's try another option, perhaps option F:19.5% annual. So monthly rate is 19.5/12=1.625% or 0.01625.

Compute the present value factor.

(1 - (1.01625)^-18 ) / 0.01625.

First, compute (1
