Question:

The rational-economic model of decision-making is based on the assumption that:

Options:

A: decision-makers can predict the outcome of their decisions with 100% accuracy.
B: individuals are better than groups at making decisions, especially under stressful conditions.
C: decision-makers place more emphasis on the costs of certain decisions than on other consequences of their decisions.
D: decision-makers will always choose the alternative that yields the greatest personal benefit.
E: decision-makers are incapable of making rational decisions due to cognitive limitations.
F: decision-makersâ€™ knowledge about possible alternatives is always incomplete.
G: decision-makers prioritize the immediate benefits of a decision over its long-term consequences.
H: decision-makers often base their decisions on the opinions of others, rather than on a thorough analysis of the options.
I: decision-makers have complete information about all alternatives and their consequences before making decisions.
J: decision-makers are influenced by their emotions and personal biases when making decisions.

Okay, so I've got this question about the rational-economic model of decision-making. I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

From what I remember, the rational-economic model assumes that people make decisions in a logical and systematic way. I think it's based on the idea that decision-makers have all the necessary information and can process it perfectly to make the best choice.

So the question is asking about the assumption of this model. The options are A through J. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A says decision-makers can predict outcomes with 100% accuracy. Hmm, that seems too certain. I don't think the model assumes perfect prediction, because that's unrealistic. It's more about using available info to make the best choice.

Option B claims individuals are better than groups under stress. I'm not sure about that. I think group dynamics can affect decisions, but I don't recall this being a core assumption of the rational model. Maybe it's more about individual vs group decision-making in other contexts.

Option C suggests emphasis on costs over other consequences. That might be part of it, but I think the model is more about evaluating all possible outcomes, not just costs. So maybe not the best fit.

Option D states decision-makers choose the greatest personal benefit. That sounds familiar. The rational model is often linked to self-interest, where individuals select the option that maximizes their utility or benefit. So D could be a candidate.

Option E says decision-makers can't make rational decisions due to cognitive limits. Wait, that's more like bounded rationality, which is a different model proposed by Herbert Simon. So E is probably not the right answer here.

Option F mentions incomplete knowledge about alternatives. Again, bounded rationality deals with limitations in knowledge and processing. The rational-economic model, I think, assumes complete information, so F might not be correct.

Option G talks about prioritizing immediate benefits. That sounds like a bias or heuristic people use, but I don't think it's an assumption of the rational model. The model would expect consideration of both short and long-term benefits.

Option H says decisions are based on others' opinions. That's more about social influence or groupthink, which isn't part of the rational model's assumptions.

Option I states that decision-makers have complete information. Yes, this rings a bell. The rational model assumes full information about all alternatives and their consequences. So I is a strong contender.

Option J suggests emotions and biases influence decisions. That's the opposite of the rational model, which assumes decisions are made objectively without such influences.

So now I'm a bit confused between options D and I. The rational model does assume that people will choose the option that gives them the greatest benefit (D), but it also assumes they have complete information (I). Which one is part of the model's assumption?

Wait, the question is about the base assumption. The model assumes that individuals act rationally, which includes having all the necessary information to make the optimal choice. So without complete information, the model wouldn't hold because you can't make the best decision without knowing all options and outcomes.

Therefore, the correct answer should be I: decision-makers have complete information about all alternatives and their consequences before making decisions.

The rational-economic model of decision-making is based on the assumption that decision-makers have complete information about all alternatives and their consequences before making decisions. This allows them to evaluate options systematically and make the optimal choice.
