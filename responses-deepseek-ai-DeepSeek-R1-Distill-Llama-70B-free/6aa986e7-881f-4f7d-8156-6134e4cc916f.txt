Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the freezing point of a solution. Hmm, I remember that this has to do with colligative properties. Colligative properties depend on the number of solute particles, right? So freezing point depression is one of them. 

The question gives me 92 grams of alcohol, which is ethanol (C₂H₅OH), and 500 grams of water. I need to find the freezing point of this solution. Wait, I think the formula for freezing point depression is ΔTf = i * Kf * m. But wait, what are i, Kf, and m here?

Alright, let me break it down. First, I need to find the molality (m) of the solution. Molality is moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. The solute here is ethanol, and the solvent is water. 

So, the molar mass of ethanol (C₂H₅OH) is... let's calculate that. Carbon is about 12 g/mol, so two carbons are 24. Hydrogen is about 1 each, and there are 6 hydrogens (since C₂H5 is C₂H5, and then the OH has H, so total of 6 H). So 6*1 is 6. Oxygen is 16. So 24 + 6 + 16 = 46 g/mol. 

Wait, wait. Wait, ethanol is C₂H₅OH. Which is C₂H₆O. So the molecular formula is C2H5OH, which is the same as C2H6O. So molar mass: 2*(12.01) + 6*(1.008) + 16.00. Let me compute that accurately.

2 * 12.01 = 24.02 g/mol
6 * 1.008 = 6.048 g/mol
16.00 for oxygen.
Adding them up: 24.02 + 6.048 = 30.068, plus 16 is 46.068 g/mol. So about 46.07 g/mol.

So moles of ethanol = mass / molar mass. The mass given is 92 grams. So moles = 92 g / 46.07 g/mol ≈ 2 moles. Let me calculate that more accurately: 92 divided by 46.07 is approximately 2. So about 2 moles.

Next, the solvent is water, and the mass is 500 grams. Since molality is per kilogram, I need to convert 500 g to kg, which is 0.5 kg. 

So molality m is moles of solute divided by kg of solvent. So that's 2 moles / 0.5 kg = 4 mol/kg. That seems right.

Wait, but wait. What is the van't Hoff factor (i) for ethanol in water? Ethanol is a nonelectrolyte, so it doesn't dissociate in solution. So i=1. So that part is straightforward.

Now, Kf is the cryoscopic constant for water. I remember that the Kf for water is 1.86 degrees Celsius per molal. Or wait, is it 1.86 or 1.86? Wait, let me think. Yeah, I'm pretty sure Kf for water is 1.86 °C·kg/mol.

So putting it all into the formula: ΔTf = i * Kf * m. So 1 * 1.86 * 4 = 7.44 degrees. Wait, but wait. Freezing point depression is the change, so the new freezing point is the pure solvent's freezing point minus the depression. Because adding solute lowers the freezing point.

Pure water freezes at 0°C. So the solution's freezing point will be 0 - 7.44 = -7.44°C. 

Wait, but looking at the options, that's option A: -7.44 degrees. Is that correct?

Let me double-check my steps. Molar mass of ethanol: 46.07 g/mol. 92 g /46.07 g/mol = 2 moles. Solvent mass 500g=0.5kg. So molality 4 m. Kf =1.86, i=1. So ΔTf=1.86*4=7.44. Freezing point is 0-7.44= -7.44. So answer A.

But wait, another thought: Wait, sometimes when I've seen problems, if the solvent is the major component, but in this case, the solvent is water, and the solute is ethanol. So I think the approach is correct. 

Wait, but wait, wait. Oh wait, wait. Are we using the right Kf? Because I thought that sometimes, when you have a mixed solvent, but here it's just water as solvent. So correct, Kf is 1.86 for water.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the solvent is considered as water here, which it is. So yes, the approach is correct. So the freezing point is -7.44°C, which is option A.

To determine the freezing point of the solution, we use the formula for freezing point depression:

\[
\Delta T_f = i \cdot K_f \cdot m
\]

Here:
- \(i\) is the van't Hoff factor (number of particles the solute dissociates into). For ethanol (C\(_2\)H\(_5\)OH), which is a nonelectrolyte, \(i = 1\).
- \(K_f\) is the cryoscopic constant for water, approximately \(1.86 \, ^\circ\text{C·kg/mol}\).
- \(m\) is the molality of the solution (moles of solute per kilogram of solvent).

### Step 1: Calculate the molar mass of ethanol
The molecular formula of ethanol is C\(_2\)H\(_5\)OH, which simplifies to C\(_2\)H\(_6\)O. The molar mass is:

\[
\text{Molar mass of ethanol} = (2 \cdot 12.01) + (6 \cdot 1.008) + 16.00 = 46.068 \, \text{g/mol} \, (\approx 46.07 \, \text{g/mol}).
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the moles of ethanol
The mass of ethanol is 92 g. Using the molar mass:

\[
\text{Moles of ethanol} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar mass}} = \frac{92}{46.07} \approx 2 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the molality of the solution
The mass of the solvent (water) is 500 g, which is \(0.5 \, \text{kg}\). Molality is:

\[
m = \frac{\text{Moles of solute}}{\text{Kilograms of solvent}} = \frac{2}{0.5} = 4 \, \text{mol/kg}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the freezing point depression
Using the formula \(\Delta T_f = i \cdot K_f \cdot m\):

\[
\Delta T_f = 1 \cdot 1.86 \cdot 4 = 7.44 \, ^\circ\text{C}.
\]

### Step 5: Determine the freezing point of the solution
The freezing point of pure water is \(0 \, ^\circ\text{C}\). Since the solute lowers the freezing point, the new freezing point is:

\[
T_f = 0 - \Delta T_f = 0 - 7.44 = -7.44 \, ^\circ\text{C}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The freezing point of the solution is \(-7.44 \, ^\circ\text{C}\), which corresponds to **option A**.
