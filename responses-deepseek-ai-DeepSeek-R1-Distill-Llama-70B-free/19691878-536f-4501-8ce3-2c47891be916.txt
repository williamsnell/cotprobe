Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about finding the current through an inductor at a specific time, t=2s. The question is divided into three parts: (a), (b), and (c). Each part has different conditions, so I'll need to handle them separately.

I remember that inductors have the property that the voltage across them is related to the current by V = L * di/dt, where L is the inductance. Also, since it's the passive sign convention, the current direction and voltage polarity are considered according to that convention.

Starting with part (a): V_L = 0.5t V for 0 ≤ t ≤3 s, and 0 otherwise. The inductor is 0.1 H. At t= -3, i_L is 0. 

I think I should find the current i(t) by integrating the voltage across the inductor because V = L (di/dt) → di = V dt / L. So integrating from t_initial to t_final should give me the change in current.

Wait, but inductors have the property that the current can't change instantaneously. So at t=0, the current starts at 0, as given. Then, for t between 0 and 3, the voltage is 0.5t. So I can set up the integral of V(t) from 0 to t divided by L to get i(t).

So for part (a), I need to compute i(2s). Since 2s is within the 0 to 3s interval, I plug t=2 into the equation.

The current i(t) is the integral from 0 to t of V(t') dt' divided by L.

V(t') is 0.5 t', so the integral is ∫0^t (0.5 t') dt' → 0.5 * (t'^2 / 2) evaluated from 0 to t.

That gives (0.5)(t²/2 - 0) = t²/4.

So i(t) = (t²/4) / 0.1 → (t²)/(0.4) = 2.5 t².

At t=2s, i = 2.5 * (2)^2 = 2.5 *4=10 A. Hmm, but wait, wait. Let me double-check the integration.

Wait, the integral of 0.5t' dt' from 0 to t is (0.5 * t'^2 / 2) from 0 to t → (0.5 * t²/2) = t²/4. Then divide by L (0.1 H) → (t²/4) /0.1 → t²/(0.4) → 2.5 t².

Yes, that seems correct. So at t=2, i=2.5 * (4) =10 A. So part (a) is 10 A. Looking at the options, let's see. The options have part (a) as first number. Looking for options where the first number is 10.

Options: 

H:10, 22.5, 23.6

Wait, but let me check the other parts, because I might have made a mistake.

Moving to part (b): V_L = 0.5(t+2) V for -2 ≤ t ≤1 s, and 0 otherwise. i_L=0 at t=-3.

Wait, the time interval for which V is non-zero is from -2 to 1. But the question is about t=2s. Wait, t=2s is beyond the 1s point where V becomes zero again. So during t>1s, V_L is zero.

In such a case, the current through an inductor remains constant because di/dt is zero when V is zero. So after t=1s, the current remains at whatever it was at t=1s.

So I need to find the current at t=1s and that will be the current at t=2s.

So compute i(t) for t from -2 to 1. Let's find the current at t=1.

V(t) is 0.5(t+2) for -2 ≤ t ≤1, and zero elsewhere.

Wait, but starting from t=-infinity to t=-2, V is zero, so current is zero (since i(-3)=0, and no voltage, so it remains zero until t=-2).

From t=-2 to t=1, V(t) is 0.5(t+2). So the current will be the integral of V from t_initial to t, divided by L.

Wait, but how do I handle the initial condition correctly?

At t=-2, the voltage starts. But the initial current at t=-2 is zero, because before that, the voltage was zero, and since inductors can't change current instantly, the current remains zero.

So for t from -2 to 1, i(t) = (1/L) * ∫ from t=-2 to t of V(t') dt'.

V(t') is 0.5(t' + 2). So the integral from -2 to t is ∫0.5(t' +2) dt'.

Let me compute that. Let u = t' +2 → du=dt'. Limits: when t'=-2, u=0; when t'=t, u= t+2.

So integral becomes 0.5 ∫ u du from u=0 to u=t+2 → 0.5*(u²/2) from 0 to t+2 → 0.5*( (t+2)^2 / 2 ) = (t+2)^2 /4.

So i(t) = ( (t+2)^2 /4 ) / 0.1 → (t+2)^2 / (0.4) → 2.5*(t+2)^2.

So at t=1s, i(1) = 2.5*(3)^2 → 2.5*9=22.5 A.

Since after t=1s, the voltage is zero, the current remains at 22.5 A. So at t=2s, the current is 22.5 A.

So part (b) is 22.5 A.

Now part (c): V_L = 2/(t² +4) V for all t, and i_L(-infty)=0.

Need to find i(2s). But wait, the voltage is given for all t, so it's a continuous function.

But how to compute the current. The current is the integral of V(t) dt divided by L, but considering the initial condition.

Wait, because as t approaches -infinity, the current approaches zero.

So the current i(t) is (1/L) * ∫_{-infty}^t V(t') dt'

So with L=0.1, i(t) = (1/0.1) ∫_{-infty}^t [2/(t'^2 +4)] dt'

So 10 times the integral of 2/(t'^2 +4) dt' from -infty to t.

The integral of 2/(t'^2 +4) dt' is 2*(1/2) arctan(t'/2) ) + C → arctan(t'/2) evaluated from -infty to t.

At t'=t: arctan(t/2)
At t'=-infty: arctan(-infty/2)= -pi/2

So the definite integral is [arctan(t/2) - (-pi/2)] = arctan(t/2) + pi/2.

Wait wait, wait. Let me compute it correctly.

The integral of 1/(x² + a²) dx is (1/a) arctan(x/a) + C.

So here, 2/(t'^2 +4) → 2 * [1/(t'^2 + (2)^2)] → so the integral is (2)*(1/2) arctan(t'/(2)) + C ) = arctan(t'/2) + C.

So from -infty to t:

[ arctan(t/2) ) - arctan( (-infty)/2 ) ] = arctan(t/2) - (-pi/2) ) → arctan(t/2) + pi/2.

So i(t) = 10 * [ arctan(t/2) + pi/2 ].

Wait, wait. Let me check the signs. As t approaches -infty, t' approaches -infty, so t'/2 approaches -infty, arctan(-infty) is -pi/2. So when we subtract, it's [ arctan(t/2) ) - (-pi/2) ) ] = arctan(t/2) + pi/2.

So yes, that's correct.

At t=2s, i(2) = 10 * [ arctan(2/2) + pi/2 ] → arctan(1) is pi/4.

So i(2) = 10*( pi/4 + pi/2 ) = 10*( 3pi/4 ) ≈ 10 * 2.356 ≈ 23.56 A.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately. Pi is approximately 3.1416. So 3pi/4 is about 2.3562. Multiply by 10 → 23.562 A. So approximately 23.56 A.

Looking at the options, which option has 10 for (a), 22.5 for (b), and approximately 23.56 for (c)?

Looking at the options:

Option H: 10, 22.5, 23.6 → which matches our calculations.

Wait, let me double-check the part (c) calculation because sometimes the integral limits might have been tricky.

Wait, the integral from -infty to t of V(t') dt' is the same as the definite integral, which I computed as arctan(t/2) + pi/2. So i(t) =10*( arctan(t/2) + pi/2 )

At t=2, arctan(1) is pi/4.

So 10*(pi/4 + pi/2) → 10*(3pi/4) → 10*(2.356) ≈23.56 A. So yes, 23.6 A as in option H.

So option H's parts are 10, 22.5, 23.6.

Looking at the options, option H is:

H: 10 A, 22.5 A, 23.6 A.

So the correct answer should be option H.

To solve the problem, we analyze each part separately using the relationship between voltage and current for an inductor, \( V = L \frac{di}{dt} \), where \( L = 0.1 \, \text{H} \). The current is determined by integrating the voltage across the inductor over time, divided by \( L \), while considering the initial conditions.

---

### Part (a): \( V_L = 0.5t \, \text{V} \) for \( 0 \leq t \leq 3 \, \text{s} \), and \( V_L = 0 \) otherwise. \( i_L(-3) = 0 \).

The current is given by:
\[
i(t) = \frac{1}{L} \int_0^t V(t') \, dt'
\]
Substituting \( V(t') = 0.5t' \):
\[
i(t) = \frac{1}{0.1} \int_0^t 0.5t' \, dt' = 10 \cdot \frac{t'^2}{4} \Big|_0^t = 2.5t^2
\]
At \( t = 2 \, \text{s} \):
\[
i(2) = 2.5 \cdot (2)^2 = 10 \, \text{A}
\]

---

### Part (b): \( V_L = 0.5(t+2) \, \text{V} \) for \( -2 \leq t \leq 1 \, \text{s} \), and \( V_L = 0 \) otherwise. \( i_L(-3) = 0 \).

The current is given by:
\[
i(t) = \frac{1}{L} \int_{-2}^t V(t') \, dt'
\]
Substituting \( V(t') = 0.5(t' + 2) \):
\[
i(t) = \frac{1}{0.1} \int_{-2}^t 0.5(t' + 2) \, dt' = 10 \cdot \frac{(t' + 2)^2}{4} \Big|_{-2}^t = 2.5(t + 2)^2
\]
At \( t = 1 \, \text{s} \):
\[
i(1) = 2.5 \cdot (1 + 2)^2 = 2.5 \cdot 9 = 22.5 \, \text{A}
\]
Since \( V_L = 0 \) for \( t > 1 \, \text{s} \), the current remains constant at \( 22.5 \, \text{A} \). Thus, at \( t = 2 \, \text{s} \):
\[
i(2) = 22.5 \, \text{A}
\]

---

### Part (c): \( V_L = \frac{2}{t^2 + 4} \, \text{V} \) for all \( t \), and \( i_L(-\infty) = 0 \).

The current is given by:
\[
i(t) = \frac{1}{L} \int_{-\infty}^t V(t') \, dt'
\]
Substituting \( V(t') = \frac{2}{t'^2 + 4} \):
\[
i(t) = \frac{1}{0.1} \int_{-\infty}^t \frac{2}{t'^2 + 4} \, dt' = 10 \cdot \left[ \arctan\left(\frac{t'}{2}\right) \right]_{-\infty}^t
\]
The definite integral evaluates to:
\[
i(t) = 10 \cdot \left[ \arctan\left(\frac{t}{2}\right) + \frac{\pi}{2} \right]
\]
At \( t = 2 \, \text{s} \):
\[
i(2) = 10 \cdot \left[ \arctan(1) + \frac{\pi}{2} \right] = 10 \cdot \left[ \frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\pi}{2} \right] = 10 \cdot \frac{3\pi}{4} \approx 23.6 \, \text{A}
\]

---

### Final Answer:
From the calculations:
- Part (a): \( i(2) = 10 \, \text{A} \)
- Part (b): \( i(2) = 22.5 \, \text{A} \)
- Part (c): \( i(2) \approx 23.6 \, \text{A} \)

The correct option is **H: 10 A, 22.5 A, 23.6 A**.
