Okay, so I've got this psychology question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The question is about a psychologist designing a study to investigate the impact of age on intelligence. They're asking which research design would most likely show that intelligence test scores begin to decline in early adulthood.

Hmm, I remember that there are different research methods used in psychology for different purposes. Let me think about each option and what they entail.

The options are A through J: case study, longitudinal, observational, experimental, analogue, comparative, survey, cross-sectional, cross-sequential, correlational.

So the question is about age-related changes in intelligence. I think this relates to developmental psychology, which looks at changes over a person's lifespan. To study changes over time, especially across different age groups, you need a design that can capture data at various points in people's lives.

Wait, cross-sectional versus longitudinal studies. I remember that cross-sectional studies take a snapshot of different age groups at one point in time. For example, they might test 20-year-olds, 30-year-olds, 40-year-olds, etc., all in the same year. But longitudinal studies follow the same group of people over time, maybe testing them every few years as they age.

So if the psychologist uses a cross-sectional design (option H), she's comparing different cohorts at the same time. But if she uses a longitudinal design (option B), she's tracking the same individuals as they age. Which of these would show a decline in early adulthood?

Wait, but I think there's a catch here. Some studies have shown that cross-sectional designs might indicate a decline starting in early adulthood because each age group is tested once. For example, if 25-year-olds score higher than 35-year-olds in the same study, it suggests a decline. But wait, that's not necessarily accurate because it's comparing different people. Maybe the 35-year-olds were born in a different time, had different education, etc. So actually, cross-sectional studies might show such a decline, but is that the correct interpretation?

Alternatively, longitudinal studies track the same people. So if you start testing a group in their early 20s and then follow them over the years, you might see their individual scores decline over time. But wait, I thought that some studies suggest that certain aspects of intelligence, like fluid intelligence, do decline with age, while crystallized intelligence increases. So longitudinal data would show within-person changes.

Wait, but the question says the results will most likely indicate decline in early adulthood. So which design would more clearly show that trend? If the study uses a cross-sectional approach, they might see that older cohorts have lower scores, but that's not necessarily because the same individuals are declining. It could be due to generational differences.

I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The question is which design would show that decline. If a cross-sectional study is done, and they find that as age increases, test scores decrease, that's what the psychologist would report. But some argue that this might not accurately reflect individual changes because of cohort effects. On the other hand, a longitudinal study would more accurately show individual changes over time.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "intelligences test scores begin to decline in early adulthood." So it's about when the decline starts. If the study is cross-sectional, they might compare different age groups and see that, say, from 25 to 35, the average scores drop. But that's a between-subjects comparison, not within the same people. So maybe the cross-sectional design is more likely to show this decline because it's looking at different people at different ages.

Alternatively, a longitudinal study would track the same people and show their individual declines. But if the question is about when the decline begins, perhaps a cross-sectional study is the one that would find that, because it's looking across ages at one time.

Wait, but another thought: I've heard that cross-sectional studies can sometimes show earlier declines because they don't account for cohort effects. For example, older people might have had less education, leading to lower scores, which might appear as a decline when it's not due to aging but to other factors.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Alternatively, the correct answer might be cross-sectional because it's the method that would indicate such a decline, even if it's not the most accurate method.

Wait, let me think about the options again. The options are:

A: case study – that's in-depth study of a single person or small group, not relevant for age trends.

B: longitudinal – tracks same people over time.

C: observational – could be various types, but doesn't specifically address age.

D: experimental – involves manipulation, not just measuring over time.

E: analogue – uses simulated situations, not relevant here.

F: comparative – compares groups, but cross-sectional is a type.

G: survey – collects data via self-report, not testing.

H: cross-sectional – different age groups at same time.

I: cross-sequential – combination of cross-sectional and longitudinal? Maybe, but not sure.

J: correlational – looks for relationships but doesn't imply the design.

The question is about which design would most likely indicate the decline. If the psychologist uses a cross-sectional design, she would compare people of different ages. Suppose 20-year-olds score higher than 30-year-olds, which might suggest a decline. So she would report that decline starts in early adulthood based on cross-sectional data.

Alternatively, a longitudinal study would show if the same individuals' scores drop as they age. But the question is about the results indicating a decline, not the method's accuracy. So the answer would be cross-sectional, which is option H.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because some textbooks might point out that cross-sectional designs can sometimes show a decline that isn't real. Like, if each generation has different educational backgrounds, that could affect the results. But the question is about what the results would most likely indicate, not the validity of the method.

So I think the correct answer is H: cross-sectional.

The question asks which research design would most likely indicate that intelligence test scores begin to decline in early adulthood. To answer this, it is important to consider the nature of the research designs provided:

- **Case study (A):** Involves an in-depth study of a single person or small group, which is not suitable for studying age-related trends across populations.  
- **Longitudinal (B):** Tracks the same individuals over time, providing insights into within-person changes. However, the question focuses on identifying a decline in early adulthood, which can be observed in cross-sectional data.  
- **Observational (C):** Involves observing behavior but does not specifically address age-related changes in intelligence.  
- **Experimental (D):** Requires manipulating variables, which is not relevant to this study.  
- **Analogue (E):** Uses simulated situations, which is not applicable here.  
- **Comparative (F):** Involves comparing groups but is too broad to specifically address the age-related decline in intelligence.  
- **Survey (G):** Relies on self-report data, which is not suitable for measuring intelligence test scores.  
- **Cross-sectional (H):** Involves studying different age groups at the same point in time. This design can reveal trends, such as declining intelligence test scores across age groups, even if it does not track the same individuals over time.  
- **Cross-sequential (I):** Combines cross-sectional and longitudinal elements but is not the most straightforward choice for this question.  
- **Correlational (J):** Examines relationships between variables but does not imply a specific design to study age-related changes.

A cross-sectional design (H) is the most likely to indicate a decline in intelligence test scores in early adulthood because it compares different age groups at one time, allowing for the observation of trends across ages. While longitudinal studies (B) provide more accurate within-person data, the question focuses on the results indicating a decline, which can be observed using cross-sectional data.
