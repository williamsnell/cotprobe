Question:

The Latino American Party was founded and chartered in a state to promote the political power of Latino Americans. Members pledged themselves to vote only for candidates nominated by the party. At first, membership was open to any voter who pledged himself to those tenets, but after the defeats in a recent election, the Party expelled all nonLatino members upon the grounds that experience showed that only Latinos could be trusted to honor the obligation to vote only for the Party's nominees. Membership is currently confined to Latinos. In every election since, the Party's nominees have easily won election in their Congressional District. Subsequently, the Executive Committee proposes that the Party choose its own Latino candidate for governor of New Mexico in the upcoming election. It will put its slate for U. S. representatives, governor, and U. S. senator before Party members for mail ballot, along with any rival candidates who qualify for the poil. In an action by non-Latino citizens in the relevantCongressional District to enjoin the Latino AmericanParty from conducting the mail ballot primary, thefederal court will most likely

Options:

A: deny relief, because the Party's primary would be private action and not subject to restriction under the Constitution.
B: grant relief, because the primary would be proscribed by the Thirteenth Amendment.
C: deny relief, because a pre-primary election is not within the scope of federal election control.
D: grant relief, because the primary would be proscribed by the Seventeenth Amendment.
E: grant relief, because the primary would be proscribed by the Fifteenth Amendment.
F: grant relief, because the primary would be proscribed by the First Amendment.
G: deny relief, because the primary would be upheld by the Nineteenth Amendment.
H: deny relief, because the political party has the right to choose its own members.
I: deny relief, because the primary would be upheld by the Tenth Amendment.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about constitutional law, specifically dealing with political parties and their primaries. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to break it down.

The question is about the Latino American Party, which was founded to promote the political power of Latino Americans. Initially, membership was open to any voter who agreed to vote only for the party's nominees. But after some election defeats, they expelled all non-Latino members, deciding that only Latinos could be trusted to support their candidates. Now, membership is limited to Latinos.

In every election since, their nominees have easily won in their Congressional District. Now, the Executive Committee wants to choose a Latino candidate for governor and other positions, and they're planning a mail ballot primary. Non-Latino citizens are suing to stop this primary, and the question is whether the federal court will grant relief.

The options are from A to J, each citing different constitutional amendments or reasons.

First, I need to recall the relevant constitutional amendments and legal principles. I remember that political parties have a lot of autonomy in choosing their members and candidates. There's a Supreme Court case called Democratic Party of the United States v. LaFollette, which held that parties can decide whether to allow non-members to vote in their primaries. But another case, Smith v. Allwright, comes to mind. I think that case dealt with excluding African Americans from voting in primaries, and the Supreme Court ruled that was a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment because it was racial discrimination in voting.

Wait, the Fifteenth Amendment says that the right to vote shall not be denied on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. So if the Latino American Party is excluding non-Latinos from membership, and thus from participating in their primary, that could be a problem under the Fifteenth Amendment.

But wait a second. The primary here is a mail ballot, and the party is only allowing its own members (who are Latinos) to vote. So non-Latino citizens can't participate in this primary. But is this a public or private action? The question states that the party is conducting the mail ballot primary, which I think is a private process. However, the impact might still be on the public election process.

In the case of Smith v. Allwright, the Democratic Party was effectively the only party in Texas, so their primary was crucial. The Court held that excluding African Americans from the primary was state action because the primary was integral to the election process, and thus the exclusion violated the Fifteenth Amendment.

But wait, in this scenario, the Latino American Party is just one party, and they're conducting their own primary. Non-Latinos can presumably vote in other parties' primaries or as independents in the general election. So does excluding non-Latinos from this particular primary violate the Fifteenth Amendment?

I'm a bit confused. The Fifteenth Amendment applies to state and federal elections, but primaries are generally considered part of the election process. However, if the primary is conducted by a private party, maybe it's different. But in Smith v. Allwright, the Court found that the primary was state action because the state was involved in conducting it. Here, the party is conducting its own primary without state involvement, so perhaps it's not state action.

Wait, but the question is about a federal court enjoining the party. So if the primary is a private action, then the Fifteenth Amendment, which applies to government action, wouldn't apply. But if the primary has a significant impact on the public election, maybe it's considered state action. Alternatively, if the primary is entirely a private function, the party can set its own membership rules.

Another angle: the Nineteenth Amendment deals with sex discrimination in voting, which isn't relevant here. The Thirteenth Amendment deals with slavery and involuntary servitude, also not directly applicable. The Seventeenth Amendment is about the direct election of Senators, not relevant here. The First Amendment protects association, so a political party might argue that they have the right to free association to choose their members. But the Supreme Court has sometimes balanced that against equal protection concerns.

Wait, in the case of California Democratic Party v. Jones (2000), the Supreme Court held that a state law requiring open primaries was unconstitutional because it interfered with the party's First Amendment right to associate. But that was about the state forcing the party to allow non-members to vote in their primary. In this case, the party is restricting membership based on race, which is a more serious issue.

So if the party is excluding people based on race, even in a primary, that might violate the Fifteenth Amendment if it's state action. But if it's purely a private primary, perhaps not. But I'm not sure if the primary here is considered state action.

Alternatively, under the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection clause, but that applies to state action, not private parties. So if the party's primary isn't state action, then the Fourteenth Amendment wouldn't apply. But if the primary is integral to the electoral process, perhaps it is considered state action.

Wait, the question says it's a mail ballot primary conducted by the party. So probably, it's a private action. Therefore, the Fifteenth Amendment wouldn't apply because that's a constitutional amendment restricting government action, not private parties.

But wait, the Latino American Party's primary might be leading to their candidates winning in the general election. So non-Latinos are effectively being excluded from the electoral process because the primary determines the winner. But in that case, it's more about the impact than the primary itself.

Alternatively, the court might see this as a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment because the party's exclusionary membership affects the voting rights of non-Latinos in the election. But I'm not entirely certain.

Looking at the options: option E says grant relief because the primary would be proscribed by the Fifteenth Amendment. Option B says the same but with the Thirteenth Amendment. Option F is First Amendment, which might be the party's defense, but the question is whether the court will enjoin them.

If the court finds that the party's exclusion is a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment, they would grant relief (option E). But if the primary is a private action, then the court might deny relief, pointing to the party's right to associate (option H or A).

I think Smith v. Allwright might be the key here. In that case, the exclusion was based on race, and the Court held it was a violation. But in that case, the primary was conducted by the state, making it state action. Here, the party is conducting it privately, so maybe not.

Wait, but the question says the party is a political party, and their primary is part of the election process. So maybe the court would consider it state action because it's integral to the election. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the party's right to choose its own members is protected under the First Amendment, as in the case of political parties having the freedom of association. So the court might deny relief, saying the party can set its membership rules.

But wait, in Smith v. Allwright, the court held that the exclusion was unconstitutional because it was race-based, even though it was a primary. But that was when the state was involved in the primary process. Here, it's a private party, so perhaps it's different.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to outline the possibilities.

1. If the primary is considered state action, then excluding non-Latinos would violate the Fifteenth Amendment. So the court would grant relief (option E).
2. If the primary is private, then the party can exclude based on race, but that seems unlikely because the Fourteenth Amendment doesn't apply to private actors. However, the Fifteenth Amendment applies to government action, so private discrimination in voting might not be covered. Wait, but the Fifteenth Amendment only prohibits government from denying the vote based on race, not private parties. So if the primary is a private event, the party can exclude non-Latinos without violating the Fifteenth Amendment.

But wait, in Smith v. Allwright, the party was the de facto state actor because the primary was the decisive election. So in this case, if the Latino American Party's primary is the decisive election (since their nominees always win), then it might be considered state action, making the exclusion a Fifteenth Amendment violation.

So if the primary is effectively the election, then excluding non-Latinos would be a problem. Therefore, the court would grant relief under the Fifteenth Amendment (option E).

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, the party's exclusion might be seen as a violation of the Voting Rights Act, but the question focuses on constitutional amendments.

So, putting it all together, I think the correct answer is E: grant relief because the primary would be proscribed by the Fifteenth Amendment.

The question revolves around whether a federal court will grant relief to non-Latino citizens seeking to enjoin the Latino American Party from conducting a mail ballot primary that excludes non-Latino members. The analysis hinges on constitutional principles, particularly the Fifteenth Amendment, which prohibits racial discrimination in voting. 

The Latino American Party initially allowed membership to all voters but later restricted membership to Latinos, arguing that only Latinos could be trusted to honor the obligation to vote for the party's nominees. The party's nominees have consistently won elections, making their primary effectively decisive in the general election. Non-Latino citizens argue that this exclusion violates their constitutional rights.

Key considerations include:

1. **Fifteenth Amendment**: Prohibits denying the right to vote based on race. In *Smith v. Allwright*, the Supreme Court ruled that excluding African Americans from a primary violated the Fifteenth Amendment, as the primary was integral to the election process and constituted state action. Similarly, if the Latino American Party's primary is deemed decisive, excluding non-Latinos could be seen as a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment.

2. **State Action Doctrine**: If the primary is considered state action (e.g., if it is integral to the election process), the exclusion of non-Latinos would likely violate the Fifteenth Amendment. However, if the primary is viewed as a private event, the Fifteenth Amendment would not apply, as it only restricts government action.

3. **First Amendment**: Political parties have a right to free association, but this right must be balanced against equal protection and voting rights concerns. The Supreme Court has upheld parties' rights to restrict membership in some cases, but race-based exclusions are more problematic.

Given the facts, the Latino American Party's primary appears to be decisive in the general election, making it akin to state action. Therefore, excluding non-Latinos based on race likely violates the Fifteenth Amendment. The court would likely grant relief on these grounds.
