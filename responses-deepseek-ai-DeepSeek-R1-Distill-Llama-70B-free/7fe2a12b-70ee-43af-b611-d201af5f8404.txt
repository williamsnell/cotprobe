Okay, so I've got this cam follower problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that a plate cam causes a reciprocating roller follower to execute simple harmonic motion. The maximum displacement is 2 inches. The motion has a rise for 140 degrees of cam rotation and a fall for 160 degrees. The follower's roller has a radius of 1 inch, and the pressure angle shouldn't exceed 35 degrees. I need to find two things: the perpendicular distance between the follower axis and the camshaft axis, and the smallest possible size of the cam for it to work quietly and efficiently.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that in cam-follower mechanisms, the motion is designed so that the follower moves in a certain path as the cam rotates. Since the follower is a roller, it's a type of follower that can rotate, which probably affects the pressure angle.

First, the maximum displacement is 2 inches. That probably relates to the stroke of the follower. The stroke is the total distance the follower moves from its lowest to highest position. So the lift is 2 inches.

The cam rotates, and during 140 degrees it rises, and during 160 degrees it falls. Wait, that's 140 and 160 degrees, which together make 300 degrees. Oh wait, no, because a full circle is 360. So the total angle for rise and fall is 300 degrees. Does that mean the dwell angles are 60 degrees each? Because 360 - (140+160) = 60. So the follower stays at the top and bottom for 60 degrees each? Or maybe not necessarily equal, but the sum is 60. Well, maybe that's not critical right now.

The follower is a roller with 1 inch radius. That's important. I think the base circle of the cam is related to the follower's size. I remember that the base circle is the smallest circle that the cam can have without causing the follower to leave the cam. So the base circle radius must be at least the radius of the follower. Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Or perhaps it's the distance from the camshaft axis to the follower's axis.

Wait, the perpendicular distance between the follower axis and the camshaft axis is the first thing to find. I think that's called the eccentricity in some contexts. Let me think. For a reciprocating follower, the distance between the axes is important because it affects the motion.

The follower is doing simple harmonic motion. So the displacement is sinusoidal. The maximum displacement is 2 inches, which is the amplitude. Wait, but the lift is 2 inches total. So the amplitude would be 1 inch, from the mid-point. So the total lift is twice the amplitude.

Wait, no. Simple harmonic motion (SHM) has displacement described by x = A sin(theta), where A is the amplitude. So in SHM, the maximum displacement is A. But in this case, the maximum displacement is 2 inches, so A would be 2 inches. Hmm, but then I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the lift is the total movement, so from lowest to highest is 2 inches. So the amplitude is 1 inch. Because in SHM, the amplitude is the maximum from the equilibrium. So perhaps that's correct.

But the problem states maximum displacement is 2 inches, which makes me think that the amplitude is 2 inches. Hmm, maybe I should clarify that.

Wait, the question says "maximum displacement of 2 in." So that would be A=2 inches. So the follower moves 2 inches from the lowest to highest point. Or wait, in SHM, the maximum displacement is from the mean position. So the total stroke (from lowest to highest) would be 2A. So if the maximum displacement is 2 inches, that would mean the stroke is 4 inches. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the total lift is 2 inches, so the amplitude is 1 inch.

I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. The problem says "maximum displacement of 2 in." So if the follower moves from, say, position x=0 to x=2, that's a maximum displacement of 2 inches. So the amplitude is 2 inches. But in SHM, the maximum displacement is the amplitude, so that would make sense. So the displacement varies from -A to +A, but if the follower can't go negative (like it's constrained), then perhaps it's moving from 0 to 2A. Hmm, but the problem says it's a reciprocating motion, so it moves back and forth between two points. So maybe the total stroke is 2A.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. In SHM for a cam follower, the displacement is measured from the equilibrium position. So if the maximum displacement is 2 inches, that's the amplitude. So the follower moves from +2 to -2, making a total stroke of 4 inches. But that doesn't make sense with the problem statement. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, perhaps the maximum displacement refers to the total lift, which is the distance from the lowest to highest position. So if lift is 2 inches, then the amplitude is 1. So the SHM is such that the displacement goes from +1 to -1, making a total of 2 inches. That would make more sense.

I think that's the right approach. So the lift is 2 inches, meaning the amplitude A is 1 inch. So the follower moves 1 inch above and below the equilibrium position, totaling 2 inches.

Now, the motion is simple harmonic, which means the cam is designed to give that motion. The rise is over 140 degrees, fall over 160 degrees. So the cam's angle for rise is θ_r =140 degrees, and for fall θ_f=160 degrees.

I remember that for a cam with a reciprocating follower, the motion can be described by a harmonic motion, and the cam contour can be designed using the concept of the base circle and the follower's movement.

The base circle radius is the radius of the smallest circle that the cam can have. The base circle is the circle with radius equal to the distance from the camshaft axis to the follower's axis minus the follower's radius. Or wait, no: the base circle is the radius of the cam when the follower is at the lowest point.

Wait, the base circle is the smallest circle on the cam. So when the follower is at its lowest position, the distance from the camshaft axis to the point of contact is the base circle radius. So that would be equal to the perpendicular distance between the axes (let's call it 'e') minus the radius of the follower (r_f), but I'm not sure. Or perhaps it's e plus r_f? Hmm.

Wait, the base circle radius is the radius of the cam when the follower is at the lowest position. So the base circle would be the distance from the camshaft axis to the follower axis (e) minus the follower's radius (r). Because the follower is in contact with the base circle at the lowest point.

So base circle radius R_base = e - r_f.

Wait, but if e is the distance between the axes, and the follower has radius r_f, then at the lowest point, the point of contact is at e - r_f from the camshaft axis. So yes, R_base = e - r_f.

But wait, what if e is less than r_f? Then R_base would be negative, which doesn't make sense. So e must be greater than r_f. So e > r_f.

Given that the roller radius is 1 inch, so e must be larger than 1 inch.

Now, the pressure angle is the angle between the line of the follower's motion and the line connecting the contact point to the camshaft axis. It shouldn't exceed 35 degrees here.

Pressure angle is important because if it's too large, the follower might jam or there could be excessive wear. So we need to ensure that the maximum pressure angle during the motion is less than or equal to 35 degrees.

To find the perpendicular distance 'e' and the base circle radius, I think we can approach this using the concept of the cam's pitch curve and the maximum pressure angle condition.

I remember that the maximum pressure angle occurs at the point where the follower starts to move from its extreme position. So, for a reciprocating follower, the maximum pressure angle occurs at the beginning and end of the rise and fall.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum pressure angle occurs at the point where the cam's pitch curve is at its highest point.

Wait, I think the maximum pressure angle occurs when the follower is at the extreme position, either highest or lowest. Because the contact point is at the top of the cam's pitch curve, which would make the line of centers (from camshaft to follower axis) aligned with the follower's face.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the cam's radial position when the follower is at maximum displacement.

Wait, the maximum displacement is 2 inches. So the follower is at 2 inches from its central position. So the cam must have a certain profile to allow that.

Let me try to draw a mental picture. The cam has a base circle of radius R_base. The follower is a roller of radius r_f = 1 inch. The distance between the camshaft axis and the follower's axis is 'e'.

At any point, the distance between the camshaft axis and the contact point on the follower is R_base + some offset depending on the cam's profile.

Wait, when the follower is at its highest point, the distance from the camshaft axis to the contact point would be R_base + e, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the point of contact is at R_base, but the follower's center is at a distance e away, so the contact point's position depends on both R_base and e.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the geometry when the follower is at the top of its stroke. At that point, the center of the follower is at a distance 'e' from the camshaft. The contact point on the follower's surface is 1 inch (r_f) away from the follower's center. So the distance from the camshaft axis to the contact point would be sqrt(e^2 + (r_f)^2), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps when the follower is at its highest point, the contact point is at the top of the cam. So the distance from the camshaft axis to the contact point is R_base, and the distance from the contact point to the follower's center is r_f. So the line connecting the camshaft axis to the follower's center makes some angle with the vertical, determined by the pressure angle.

Wait, I think I should model this. Let me imagine the camshaft axis is at point O, and the follower's axis is at point C, which is at a perpendicular distance 'e' from O. The contact point is P on the cam's surface.

When the follower is at its maximum displacement (say, highest point), the contact point P is on the cam's outer edge. The line OP is the radius of the cam at that point, R. The line PC connects P to the follower's center C, which is of length r_f (1 inch). The angle between OP and PC is the pressure angle θ.

So, from triangle OCP, we can apply the law of sines or cosines to relate e, R, r_f, and θ.

Wait, perhaps using the law of cosines. In triangle OCP, OP is R, PC is r_f, and OC is e. The angle at P is the pressure angle θ.

So, using the law of cosines on triangle OCP:

OC^2 = OP^2 + PC^2 - 2 * OP * PC * cos(theta)

Which would be:

e^2 = R^2 + r_f^2 - 2 R r_f cos(theta)

Wait, but wait, because theta is the angle at P, which is the angle between OP and PC. But in our case, the pressure angle is the angle between the line of motion (which is vertical for a reciprocating follower) and the line connecting the contact point to the center (OP). So perhaps the angle in the triangle is 90 degrees plus theta? Or maybe not. Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps the pressure angle is the angle between the follower's direction (which is vertical) and the line from the contact point to the cam center. So, let's say the vertical line is the line of motion. The line OP makes an angle theta with this vertical, which is the pressure angle.

So, in that case, the line OC (distance e) is the hypotenuse of a right triangle. Wait, no, because OP is R, and PC is r_f. So perhaps using the sine of the angle theta.

Wait, maybe it's better to use the right triangle approach. When the follower is at the top, the contact point P is at the top of the cam. So, the line OP is vertical, and the line PC is at an angle theta from vertical.

Wait, no, because the follower is offset by e from the camshaft. So, when the follower is at the top of its stroke, the contact point is at the top of the cam. So, the point P is at the top of the cam, and the center C is at a distance e from O. So, the line OP is vertical, and point C is at (0, e). The contact point P is at (0, R), where R is the radius of the cam at that point.

Wait, that might not be right. Let me think again. The cam's radius at the top would be R_base + lift. Because the base circle is when the follower is at the lowest point, so R_base is the radius there. When the follower lifts by 2 inches (since max displacement is 2 inches), the cam's radius at that point would be R_base + 2 inches.

Wait, no, because the follower's center moves 2 inches. So the cam's radius would be R_base + 2 inches? Or wait, maybe the lift is 2 inches, so the cam's radius is R_base + 2.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to find a formula or approach that relates these variables.

I remember that for a reciprocating follower with simple harmonic motion, the cam's pitch curve can be designed using the equation involving the angular displacement and the harmonic function.

But perhaps a better approach is to consider the maximum pressure angle condition. The pressure angle is given by theta = arcsin( (e) / (R + r_f) ), where R is the radius of the cam at that point.

Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The pressure angle is the angle between the direction of the follower's motion (vertical) and the line connecting the cam center (O) to the contact point (P). So, in the triangle formed by O, P, and the projection of P onto the vertical line through C (the follower's axis).

So, in this case, the horizontal distance from O to C is 'e', and the vertical distance from C to P is r_f (since the follower's roller has radius 1 inch and is in contact with P, which is at the top of the follower's position).

Wait, perhaps the vertical distance is the lift. So when the follower is at maximum displacement (lift of 2 inches), the vertical distance from the base position is 2 inches. So the line OP (from cam center O to contact point P) would form an angle theta with the vertical, which is the pressure angle.

In this case, the horizontal component is e, and the vertical component is R_base + 2 inches (since R_base is the radius at the lowest point, and the lift adds to that). So the pressure angle theta can be found using tan(theta) = e / (R_base + lift).

But the pressure angle must not exceed 35 degrees, so:

tan(theta_max) = e / (R_base + lift) <= tan(35°)

Hmm, that sounds plausible. Let me write that down:

e / (R_base + lift) <= tan(35°)

But wait, the lift is the maximum displacement, which is 2 inches here.

So, e / (R_base + 2) <= tan(35°)

Also, R_base is the base circle radius, which is the distance from the camshaft axis to the contact point when the follower is at the lowest position. At that point, the contact point is at R_base, and the follower's center is at a distance e from O. So the contact point P is at (0, R_base), and the follower's center is at (0, e - r_f), because the follower's radius is 1 inch. So R_base = e - r_f.

Wait, that makes sense. Because when the follower is at the lowest point, the contact point is R_base from O, and the follower's center is at R_base + r_f from O. But wait, no, the distance from O to C is e, and the contact point is at R_base. So when the follower is at the lowest position, the contact point is at R_base, and the follower's center is at R_base + r_f. But the distance from O to C is e. So:

R_base + r_f = e

Which implies R_base = e - r_f.

Since r_f is 1 inch, R_base = e - 1.

But earlier, I had the equation from the pressure angle:

e / (R_base + 2) <= tan(35°)

Now, substituting R_base = e - 1:

e / ( (e - 1) + 2 ) <= tan(35°)
e / (e + 1) <= tan(35°)

So let's compute tan(35°). Let me get that value approximately. Tan(35) is about 0.7002.

So:

e / (e +1) <= 0.7002

Multiply both sides by (e +1):

e <= 0.7002 (e +1)

e <= 0.7002e + 0.7002

Bring terms together:

e - 0.7002e <= 0.7002

0.2998 e <= 0.7002

e <= 0.7002 / 0.2998 ≈ 2.335 inches.

Hmm, that gives e <= approximately 2.335 inches. But looking at the options, the maximum e is 1.75 in (option A), 1.5 in (C), 1.286 in (others). So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe I messed up the pressure angle equation. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct equation is e / (R + r_f) = sin(theta), where R is the radius at the point of contact.

Wait, when the follower is at the top, the contact point is at R = R_base + lift. So R = R_base + 2 inches.

The line from O to P is R, and from P to C is r_f, and the line from O to C is e. So using the sine of the angle.
