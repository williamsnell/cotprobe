Okay, so I've got this question about strategies for justifying or denying unethical behavior. Hmm, I remember from my studies that people use various techniques to justify their actions when they're doing something wrong. Let me think about the different types.

The question has three blanks, each describing a different strategy. The first blank says something about actors being convinced their actions harm nobody. Oh right, that sounds familiar. I think that's called "denial of injury." Yeah, because they're denying that anyone was hurt by their actions.

The second part talks about actors arguing that their violation is an attempt to realize higher-order values. Oh wait, that's the "appeal to higher loyalties." They're saying they're doing it for a greater good, so it's justified. 

The third blank mentions arguing that they are owed something. I recall that's the "metaphor of the ledger." It's like they're keeping a moral ledger, where they believe their past good deeds balance out the current wrong, so they're owed this action.

Now, looking at the options, I need to match these in order. The first blank is denial of injury, second is appeal to higher loyalties, third is metaphor of the ledger.

Let me check the options. Option B is Denial of injury, Metaphor of the ledger, Appeal to higher loyalties. No, that's not right because the second part should be higher loyalties before ledger.

Option J says Denial of injury, Appeal to higher loyalties, Metaphor of the ledger. That fits exactly. Wait, what's the order in the question? The first is denial of injury, second is appeal to higher loyalties, third is metaphor of the ledger. So the order is J: Denial of injury, Appeal to higher loyalties, Metaphor of the ledger.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing up. Denial of injury first, then higher loyalties, then ledger. So the first blank is filled with denial of injury, second with appeal, third with metaphor. So looking for an option where the order is Denial of injury, Appeal, then Metaphor.

Looking again, option J is Denial of injury, Appeal to higher loyalties, Metaphor of the ledger. Yes, that's correct.

The question asks about three strategies used to justify or deny unethical behavior. The first strategy is "denial of injury," where actors believe their actions harm no one. The second is "appeal to higher loyalties," where actors argue their actions serve a greater good. The third is the "metaphor of the ledger," where actors justify their actions by balancing past good deeds against current wrongdoing.

The correct order of these strategies is:  
1. Denial of injury  
2. Appeal to higher loyalties  
3. Metaphor of the ledger  

Option J matches this order: Denial of injury, Appeal to higher loyalties, Metaphor of the ledger.

Answer: J
