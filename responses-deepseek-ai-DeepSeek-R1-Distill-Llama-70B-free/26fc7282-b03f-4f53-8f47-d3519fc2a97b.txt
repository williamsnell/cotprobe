Okay, so I've got this probability problem here that's about rolling an n-sided die n times. I remember that in the example given, like when n is 2 or 3, they calculated the probability of getting at least one match. A match is when side i comes up on the ith trial. Now the question is asking me to find the limit of this probability as n becomes very large, approaching infinity.

Hmm, wait. This sounds familiar. I think it's related to something called the "matching problem" or maybe the "hat-check problem". Oh right, where you have a bunch of people and their hats, and you want to know the probability that at least one person gets their own hat back. That's exactly the same setup here, but with dice instead of hats.

In the hat-check problem, the probability of at least one match (called a derangement when there are none) approaches 1 minus 1 over e as the number of items increases. So when n is large, the probability tends to 1 - 1/e. But wait, the options given include 1-1/e as option H, so maybe that's the answer.

Wait wait, let me think again. The problem is about the limit as n approaches infinity of the probability of at least one match. So first, I need to model the probability of no matches, which is the same as the derangement problem.

The number of derangements for n items is given by the subfactorial function, often written as !n. The formula for derangements is !n = n! * (1 - 1/1! + 1/2! - 1/3! + ... + (-1)^n /n! ). So the probability of no matches (derangements) is !n / n! 

So the probability of at least one match is 1 minus the probability of no matches. That's 1 - (!n / n! )

I remember that as n becomes large, the probability of a derangement approaches 1/e. So !n / n! â‰ˆ 1/e when n is large. Therefore, the probability of at least one match would approach 1 - 1/e.

Looking at the options, option H is 1 - 1/e. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes I see the approximation for derangements as 1/e, so the probability of at least one match would be 1 - 1/e. Yes, that makes sense.

Alternatively, I can model the probability using the inclusion-exclusion principle. The probability that at least one match occurs is the sum over k from 1 to n of (-1)^(k+1) * (1/k! ), because each term accounts for the probability of exactly k matches, but the inclusion-exclusion alternates signs.

But as n approaches infinity, the sum becomes the series for 1 - 1/e. Because the sum from k=0 to infinity of (-1)^k /k! is 1/e. So the probability of at least one match is 1 minus that, which is 1 - 1/e.

Yes, that checks out. So the limit as n approaches infinity is 1 - 1/e.

The problem involves rolling a fair $n$-sided die $n$ independent times and finding the limit of the probability of at least one match (where side $i$ is observed on the $i$-th trial) as $n$ approaches infinity. This is analogous to the "hat-check problem" or "derangement problem," where the probability of at least one match is calculated.

The probability of no matches (derangements) is given by the subfactorial function, $!n / n!$, where $!n$ represents the number of derangements. Using the inclusion-exclusion principle, the probability of at least one match is:

\[
P(\text{at least one match}) = 1 - \frac{!n}{n!}.
\]

As $n$ becomes large, the probability of no matches approaches $1/e$, so the probability of at least one match approaches:

\[
1 - \frac{1}{e}.
\]

This result is consistent with the series expansion of the inclusion-exclusion principle, where the probability of at least one match converges to $1 - 1/e$ as $n \to \infty$. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**H: $1 - 1/e$**.

Answer: H
