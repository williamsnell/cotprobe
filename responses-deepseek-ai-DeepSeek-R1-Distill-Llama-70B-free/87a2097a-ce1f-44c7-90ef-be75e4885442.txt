Okay, so I've got this problem here about a motor's efficiency. Hmm. Let me think about how to approach this. I'm a bit rusty on my electrical engineering, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question says a 7-hp motor takes 6.3 kilowatts at full load. I need to find its efficiency. Efficiency is generally the output power divided by the input power, right? Or wait, is it the other way around? Oh right, efficiency is output over input, because it's the ratio of useful power out to the total power consumed.

Wait, wait. Wait, the motor is rated in horsepower (hp), and the input is given in kilowatts (kW). So I need to convert the horsepower to a compatible unit, probably watts, to match the input which is in kW.

I remember that 1 horsepower is equal to about 746 watts. So 7 hp would be 7 times 746 watts. Let me calculate that. 7 * 746... 7*700 is 4900, 7*46 is 322, so total is 4900 + 322 = 5222 watts. Oh wait, 5222 watts is 5.222 kilowatts because 1 kW is 1000 watts. So the output power is 5.222 kW.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the motor's output is 7 hp, and the input is 6.3 kW. Or is the input 6.3 kW? So the input is 6300 watts. So the efficiency would be output over input.

So output is 7 hp, which is 5222 watts. Input is 6300 watts. So efficiency is 5222 / 6300.

Let me compute that. Let me divide 5222 by 6300. Hmm. 5222 divided by 6300. Let's see, 6300 times 0.8 is 5040. 5222 is a bit more than 5040. So 0.83 or something.

Wait, let me do it more accurately. 5222 / 6300. Let me approximate: 5222 is about 5222/6300. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 6 to simplify. 5222 รท6 is approximately 870.333, and 6300 รท6 is 1050. So 870.333 / 1050. That's about 0.83. So 83% efficiency.

Looking at the options, option F is 83%. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, sometimes efficiency can be calculated differently. Oh wait, wait, no. Efficiency is output divided by input. So if the motor outputs 7 hp (converted to watts) and the input is 6.3 kW, then yes, that's correct.

Wait, did I get the units right? 7 hp is 5222 W, 6.3 kW is 6300 W. So 5222/6300 equals approximately 0.828, which is 82.8%. So 83%, which is option F.

So I think the correct answer is F.

To determine the efficiency of the motor, we start by converting the output power from horsepower (hp) to watts (W) and the input power from kilowatts (kW) to watts (W). 

1. **Convert output power (7 hp) to watts**:  
   Since \( 1 \, \text{hp} = 746 \, \text{W} \),  
   \[
   7 \, \text{hp} = 7 \times 746 = 5222 \, \text{W}.
   \]

2. **Convert input power (6.3 kW) to watts**:  
   Since \( 1 \, \text{kW} = 1000 \, \text{W} \),  
   \[
   6.3 \, \text{kW} = 6.3 \times 1000 = 6300 \, \text{W}.
   \]

3. **Calculate efficiency**:  
   Efficiency is defined as the ratio of output power to input power:  
   \[
   \text{Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Output Power}}{\text{Input Power}} = \frac{5222}{6300}.
   \]

4. **Simplify the calculation**:  
   Dividing \( 5222 \) by \( 6300 \):  
   \[
   \frac{5222}{6300} \approx 0.828 \, \text{or} \, 82.8\%.
   \]

Thus, the efficiency of the motor is approximately **83%**, which corresponds to option **F**.

Answer: F
