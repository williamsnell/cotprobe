Question:

Jacob and Sons Plumbing bought a forklift for $10,000. The forklift is expected to last 5 years, and to have a residual value of $3,000. Jacob wishes to use the straight line depreciation method, while his sons wish to use the sum-of-the-years'-digits method. What will the difference in the depreciation allowances be for the third year?

Options:

A: $600
B: zero
C: $500
D: $150
E: $400
F: $200
G: $250
H: $300
I: $350
J: $100

Okay, so I've got this problem here about depreciation methods. Jacob and Sons Plumbing bought a forklift for $10,000. It's expected to last 5 years and have a residual value of $3,000. Jacob wants to use straight-line depreciation, while his sons prefer the sum-of-the-years'-digits method. The question is asking about the difference in depreciation allowances for the third year.

Hmm, I remember depreciation is about spreading the cost of an asset over its useful life. There are different methods, and each gives a different annual expense. Straight-line is pretty straightforward, I think. Let me try to break it down.

First, straight-line depreciation. The formula is (Cost - Residual Value) / Useful Life. So here, that would be ($10,000 - $3,000) divided by 5 years. That gives $7,000 / 5 = $1,400 per year. So every year, the depreciation is the same, $1,400. So for the third year, it's also $1,400.

Now the sum-of-the-years'-digits (SYD) method. I'm a bit rusty on this. I think the formula involves a fraction where the numerator is the remaining years, and the denominator is the sum of the years from 1 to the useful life. So for a 5-year life, the sum is 1+2+3+4+5=15. Each year, the depreciation rate is (remaining years)/15.

Wait, so for each year, the depreciation is (Cost - Residual) multiplied by (SYD fraction). Let me calculate the depreciation for each year.

Year 1: 5/15 * (10,000 - 3,000) = (5/15)*7,000 = (1/3)*7,000 ≈ $2,333.33

Year 2: 4/15 * 7,000 = 4/15 * 7,000 ≈ 1,866.67

Year 3: 3/15 * 7,000 = 3/15 is 1/5, so 7,000 /5 = $1,400.

Wait, so in the third year, both methods give the same depreciation? So the difference would be zero. But wait, let me double-check.

Wait, no, wait. Jacob is using straight-line, so third year is $1,400. The sons using SYD, so third year is also $1,400. So the difference is zero. That would make the answer B: zero.

But wait, did I get the SYD calculation right? Let me see. The sum is 15, as 5 years. For each year n, the fraction is (6 - n)/15. Wait, no, the formula is (n)/(sum). Wait, no, in SYD, the depreciation for year n is ( (Useful Life - year +1 ) / SYD ) * (Cost - Residual).

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate the SYD for each year.

Year 1: (5/15) *7,000 = 5/15 is 1/3. 7,000/3≈2,333.33

Year 2: (4/15)*7,000≈1,866.67

Year 3: (3/15)*7,000= 7,000*(1/5)=1,400.

Yes, that's correct. So both methods give the same depreciation in the third year. So the difference is zero. So option B is the answer.

The problem involves calculating the depreciation allowances for the third year under two different methods: straight-line and sum-of-the-years'-digits (SYD). Here's the analysis:

1. **Straight-Line Depreciation**:  
   The formula for straight-line depreciation is:  
   \[
   \text{Annual Depreciation} = \frac{\text{Cost} - \text{Residual Value}}{\text{Useful Life}}
   \]  
   Substituting the given values:  
   \[
   \text{Annual Depreciation} = \frac{10,000 - 3,000}{5} = \frac{7,000}{5} = 1,400
   \]  
   Therefore, the depreciation allowance in the third year using the straight-line method is **$1,400**.

2. **Sum-of-the-Years'-Digits (SYD) Depreciation**:  
   The SYD method calculates depreciation based on the fraction:  
   \[
   \text{Depreciation for Year } n = \frac{\text{Remaining Years}}{\text{Sum of Years' Digits}} \times (\text{Cost} - \text{Residual Value})
   \]  
   For a 5-year useful life, the sum of the years' digits is \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15\). The depreciation for the third year is:  
   \[
   \text{Depreciation for Year 3} = \frac{3}{15} \times 7,000 = \frac{1}{5} \times 7,000 = 1,400
   \]  
   Therefore, the depreciation allowance in the third year using the SYD method is also **$1,400**.

3. **Difference in Depreciation Allowances**:  
   Since both methods yield the same depreciation allowance of **$1,400** in the third year, the difference is:  
   \[
   1,400 - 1,400 = 0
   \]

Thus, the difference in depreciation allowances for the third year is **zero**.

**Answer: B**
