Okay, so I have to solve this problem about the discharge coefficient of a right-angled weir. Hmm, I remember that the discharge coefficient is a factor used to account for the inefficiencies and assumptions in the ideal flow equations. Right, the ideal discharge rate is given by Q_i = (8/15) * sqrt(2g) * h^(5/2). But in reality, the actual discharge Q is less than this, so the coefficient Cd makes up for that difference.

So the formula I think is Cd = Q / Q_i. Oh wait, right, because Cd adjusts the ideal flow rate to the actual measured one. So I'll need to calculate Cd for each pair of Q and h given in the data.

The data provided is a table where Q in cfm (cubic feet per minute) and h in inches. There are ten data points, each with a Q and h. I think the first step is to compute Q_i for each h, then find Cd for each.

Wait, let's make sure I have the formula right. The ideal discharge Q_i for a right-angled triangular weir is (8/15) * sqrt(2g) * h^(5/2). But wait, the units here matter. Because the given h is in inches, and Q is in cfm, which are in English units, I should make sure that all the units are consistent when calculating.

I think g is the acceleration due to gravity. In English units, g is approximately 32.2 ft/s². So I'll use that value.

Let me outline the steps:

1. For each h (inches), convert it to feet because the units in the formula should be consistent. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, h (ft) = h_inches / 12.

2. Calculate h^(5/2) for each h in feet.

3. Compute Q_i using the formula: (8/15) * sqrt(2g) * h^(5/2).

4. Divide the measured Q (cfm) by Q_i to get Cd.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the formula. The ideal discharge for a right-angled weir is given as Q_i = (8/15) * sqrt(2g) * h^(5/2). So yes, that's correct.

But I need to calculate this for each h. Let's pick the first data point to test.

First data point: Q=0.30 cfm, h=1 inch.

h in feet: 1/12 ≈ 0.08333 ft.

h^(5/2) = (0.08333)^(2.5). Let me compute that.

Wait, exponent 5/2 is the same as square root of h^5. So h^5 is (0.08333)^5 = let's see: (1/12)^5 = 1/(12^5) = 1/248832 ≈ 4.021e-6. Then square root of that is sqrt(4.021e-6) ≈ 0.002008. So h^(5/2) ≈ 0.002008 (ft^(5/2)).

Now, sqrt(2g) where g=32.2 ft/s². So sqrt(2*32.2) = sqrt(64.4) ≈ 8.025 ft^(1/2)/s.

Putting it into Q_i:

(8/15) * 8.025 * 0.002008.

Calculate that:

(8/15) is approximately 0.5333.

0.5333 * 8.025 = let's compute 8 * 0.5333 = 4.2664, 0.025 *0.5333≈0.0133, so total ≈4.2797.

Then multiply by 0.002008: 4.2797 * 0.002008 ≈ 0.00859 cfm.

Wait, but wait a second. The actual Q is 0.30 cfm, which is way larger than 0.00859. That can't be right. Oh wait, no, wait. Because I think I made a mistake in the units. Because the formula gives Q in ft^3/s, but the given Q is in cfm (ft^3 per minute). So I need to convert the formula's result from ft^3/s to cfm.

Wait, no, the formula's Q_i is in ft^3/s. So to convert to cfm, I multiply by 60 seconds per minute.

So let me redo that calculation.

Compute Q_i:

(8/15) * sqrt(2g) * h^(5/2) → this is in ft^3/s.

Multiply by 60 to get cfm.

So for the first data point:

h in ft: 1/12 ≈ 0.083333 ft.

h^(5/2) = (0.083333)^(2.5) → Let me compute it more accurately.

0.083333^2 = 0.0069444; 0.083333^5 = (0.083333^2) * (0.083333^3) = 0.0069444 * 0.0005787 ≈ 4.02e-6.

So h^(5/2) = sqrt(4.02e-6) ≈ 0.002008 ft^(5/2).

sqrt(2g) = sqrt(64.4) ≈8.025 ft^0.5/s.

So Q_i (ft^3/s) = (8/15) * 8.025 * 0.002008.

Compute 8/15 ≈ 0.5333.

0.5333 *8.025 ≈ 4.2797.

4.2797 * 0.002008 ≈ 0.00859 ft^3/s.

Convert to cfm: 0.00859 *60 ≈ 0.5154 cfm.

But the measured Q is 0.30 cfm. So Cd = Q / Q_i = 0.30 / 0.5154 ≈ 0.582.

Wait, that's about 0.582, which is option B (0.585) or D (0.595). Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, let me recheck each step.

h = 1 inch = 1/12 ft = 0.0833333 ft.

h^(5/2) = h^2 * sqrt(h) = (0.083333)^2 * sqrt(0.083333).

0.083333^2 = 0.00694444.

sqrt(0.083333) = approx 0.288675.

So h^(5/2) = 0.00694444 * 0.288675 ≈ 0.002008 ft^(5/2).

Yes, that's correct.

sqrt(2g) where g=32.2 ft/s²: 2g=64.4, sqrt(64.4)=8.025.

So (8/15) * 8.025 = (0.533333) *8.025 ≈ let's compute 8 *0.533333=4.266664, 0.025 *0.533333≈0.013333. So total ≈4.28.

4.28 * 0.002008 ≈ 0.008594 ft³/s.

Multiply by 60 → 0.51564 cfm.

Q is 0.30 cfm, so Cd = 0.3 / 0.51564 ≈ 0.582, which is approximately 0.582.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B:0.585 or option D:0.595. Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation leads to a slightly different value.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute Q_i more accurately.

Let me recalculate (8/15):

8/15 = 0.5333333333.

Multiply by 8.025: 0.5333333 *8.025.

Let me compute this more accurately:

8 *0.5333333=4.2666664.

0.025 *0.5333333=0.0133333325.

So sum is 4.2666664 + 0.0133333325 = 4.28.

Then, 4.28 *0.002008.

Compute 4 *0.002008=0.008032.

0.28 *0.002008=0.00056224.

Sum: 0.008032 + 0.00056224=0.00859424 ft³/s.

Multiply by 60: 0.515465 cfm.

So Cd = 0.3 / 0.515465 ≈ 0.582.

Hmm, that's 0.582. So the closest options are B:0.585, D:0.595, or perhaps others. But the options don't have 0.58 as an option. Let me check the given options.

Options are:

A:0.565, B:0.585, C:0.610, D:0.595, E:0.620, F:0.600, G:0.575, H:0.550, I:0.640, J:0.530.

So the closest is B:0.585. But wait, perhaps the calculation is supposed to be done with more precise numbers, maybe without approximating so much.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute for all the data points and see if the Cd is a constant. Or maybe the average Cd is around a certain value.

Wait, perhaps the question is to calculate the discharge coefficient for each value and then pick the correct option. But the question isn't clear on whether to compute for a specific h or to find an average.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to compute Cd for each h and then maybe find the average Cd. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question wants the Cd for a specific h, but the question says 'over a range of h' and the answer is a single value, so perhaps it's looking for an average.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the general formula for Cd for a right-angled weir. But I think the question is to compute Cd for one h, but it's unclear. Let me re-read the question.

The question says, 'calculate discharge coefficient versus h. For a right-angled triangular weir, the ideal discharge rate is Q_i = (8/15) sqrt(2g) h^5/2. From the data, calculate discharge coefficient versus h.'

So for each h, calculate Cd = Q / Q_i.

But the options are single values. So perhaps the problem is to find the Cd for a particular h, but the question doesn't specify which h to use. Alternatively, perhaps it's to compute for each h and choose the correct option, but the options are single values. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute for each h and then pick the correct option, but given that the answer is a single value, perhaps the problem expects to compute Cd for a specific h, perhaps the first one.

Wait, perhaps the question is to compute Cd for each h, but the options are given as possible answers, so perhaps the correct Cd value is one of the options for a specific h.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to compute the Cd for each h, and the options represent Cd values, but the question is to find which one is correct. But since the options are single values, perhaps the question is to compute the Cd for all h and find that it's approximately a certain value.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is to compute Cd for a particular h, perhaps the first one, as I did earlier, and that gives around 0.58, which is near option B (0.585) or G (0.575). Alternatively, perhaps I should pick the first Cd as 0.58, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of h in feet. Wait, h is in inches, so h in feet is h_inches / 12.

Wait, for the first data point, h=1 inch → 1/12=0.083333 ft.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise calculations. Let me compute h^(5/2) more accurately.

h = 0.083333 ft.

h^2 = (0.083333)^2 = 0.00694444 ft².

h^5 = h^2 * h^3.

h^3 = (0.083333)^3 = approx 0.0005787037 ft³.

So h^5 = 0.00694444 * 0.0005787037 ≈ 0.000003999 ft^5.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, h^5 is h squared multiplied by h cubed, which is 0.00694444 * 0.0005787037 = approx 4.023e-6.

Wait, no, 0.00694444 * 0.0005787037 = (6.94444e-3) * (5.787037e-4) = 6.94444e-3 *5.787037e-4 ≈ (6.94444 *5.787037) * 1e-7 → Let's compute 6.94444 *5.787037.

Approximately 6 *5=30, 6*0.787≈4.722, 0.94444*5≈4.722, 0.94444*0.787≈0.743. So total≈30 +4.722+4.722+0.743≈40.187. So 40.187e-7 → 4.0187e-6.

So h^5 = 4.0187e-6 (ft^5).

h^(5/2) is the square root of h^5, which is sqrt(4.0187e-6) = approx 0.002008 ft^(5/2).

So that's correct.

Then, sqrt(2g) = sqrt(64.4) ≈8.025.

So (8/15) *8.025 = 0.533333 *8.025 = let me compute 8 *0.533333=4.266664, 0.025 *0.533333≈0.0133333, total≈4.28.

So 4.28 *0.002008 ≈ 0.008594 ft³/s → multiply by 60 → 0.51566 cfm.

So Q_i ≈0.51566 cfm.

Measuring Q is 0.30 cfm, so Cd=0.3/0.51566 ≈0.582.

Hmm, that's 0.582, which is closest to option B (0.585) or G (0.575). But 0.582 is closer to 0.585 (0.003 away) than 0.575 (0.007 away). So perhaps the correct answer is B:0.585.

But let me check another data point to see if Cd is consistent. Let's pick the second data point: Q=4.73 cfm, h=2 inches.

h=2 inches = 2/12 = 0.1666667 ft.

h^(5/2) = (0.1666667)^(2.5).

Compute h^2 = 0.0277778 ft².

h^5 = (0.1666667)^5 = let's compute: 0.1666667^2=0.0277778, ^3=0.00462963, ^4=0.000771604, ^5=0.000128601 ft^5.

So h^(5/2) = sqrt(0.000128601) ≈ 0.011346 ft^(5/2).

Now, Q_i = (8/15)*sqrt(2g)*h^(5/2) → again, sqrt(2g)=8.025 ft^0.5/s.

So (8/15)*8.025 ≈4.28 as before.

So 4.28 *0.011346 ≈0.04856 ft³/s.

Convert to cfm: 0.04856 *60 = 2.914 cfm.

Measuring Q is 4.73 cfm, so Cd=4.73/2.914 ≈1.623? Wait, that can't be right. Because Cd is usually less than 1, as the actual Q is less than the ideal Q_i. So I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, if the measured Q is 4.73 cfm and the ideal Q_i is 2.914 cfm, then Cd would be 4.73 / 2.914 ≈1.623, which is greater than 1. That's impossible because Cd should be less than 1. So I must have made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponent in h^(5/2). Let me recompute h^(5/2) for h=2 inches=0.1666667 ft.

h^(5/2) = h^2 * sqrt(h) → h^2 is (0.1666667)^2=0.0277778, sqrt(h)=sqrt(0.1666667)=0.4082483.

So h^(5/2)=0.0277778 *0.4082483 ≈0.011346 ft^(5/2).

That seems correct. So Q_i = (8/15)*sqrt(2g)*h^(5/2) *60 → let me compute in steps.

Compute (8/15)=0.533333.

Multiply by sqrt(2g)=8.025 → 0.533333 *8.025=4.28.

Multiply by h^(5/2)=0.011346 →4.28 *0.011346≈0.04856 ft³/s.

Convert to cfm: 0.04856 *60=2.914 cfm.

But measured Q is 4.73, which is higher, which gives Cd=4.73/2.914≈1.623, which is impossible. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, no, wait a second. I think I have the formula wrong. Because the ideal discharge for a right-angled weir is actually Q_i = (8/15)*sqrt(2g)*h^(5/2). But wait, units! Because in the formula, g is in ft/s², h is in ft. So Q_i is in ft³/s.

But when I multiply by 60, I get cfm. So for h=2 inches=0.1666667 ft.

h^(5/2)=0.011346 ft^(5/2). So 4.28 *0.011346=0.04856 ft³/s. To cfm: 0.04856*60=2.914 cfm.

But the measured Q is 4.
