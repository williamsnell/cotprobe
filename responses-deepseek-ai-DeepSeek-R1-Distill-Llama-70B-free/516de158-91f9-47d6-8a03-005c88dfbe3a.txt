Okay, I'm trying to understand the consequences of using OLS when there's autocorrelation in the data. I remember that OLS assumes that the error terms are uncorrelated, right? So if that's violated, what happens?

So the question lists four possible consequences: i, ii, iii, iv. I need to figure out which ones are correct.

First, I think about coefficient estimates. I recall that in the presence of autocorrelation, the OLS estimates are still unbiased, but they become inefficient. That means the estimates themselves might not be misleading in terms of being wrong on average, but their variance is higher. So maybe statement i is incorrect? Wait, but if the estimates are inefficient, does that make them misleading? Hmm, maybe not directly. Or perhaps the term 'misleading' here refers to them being unreliable, but not necessarily biased. So I'm a bit confused here.

Next, hypothesis tests. OLS requires certain assumptions for the t and F tests to be valid. Autocorrelation affects the standard errors, making them unreliable. So if the standard errors are wrong, then the test statistics are incorrect. This could lead to type I or type II errors, meaning the hypothesis tests could reach wrong conclusions. So statement ii is probably correct.

Forecasts made from the model. Autocorrelation can affect the accuracy of forecasts. If the model doesn't account for the autocorrelation, the forecasts might not be as good. So statement iii could be correct. I think that's what happens because the model's structure isn't capturing the true relationships when autocorrelation is present.

Standard errors being inappropriate. Since autocorrelation leads to the standard errors being miscalculated, they can be either underestimated or overestimated. This makes the inference (like confidence intervals) unreliable. So statement iv is correct.

Wait, going back to statement i. If coefficients are unbiased but inefficient, they aren't misleading in expectation but have higher variance. So does that make them misleading? Or is 'misleading' implying they are wrong or incorrect? Since they're unbiased, perhaps i is incorrect. Or maybe it's still misleading because their variance is high, making them less reliable. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here.

But in my notes, I think the main points are that the coefficients are still unbiased, but standard errors are incorrect, leading to incorrect hypothesis tests. Forecasts might be biased because the model isn't correctly specified, so it's missing patterns in the data, which affects predictions.

Wait, but another thought: if autocorrelation is present, does OLS produce biased coefficient estimates? Or only in certain cases, like when there's a lagged dependent variable? Oh right, in some cases, like with a lagged DV, the coefficients can be biased. But in general, I think OLS estimates are unbiased even with autocorrelation. So statement i might not be correct. Or perhaps it's that the estimates are not necessarily misleading, but their standard errors are wrong, leading to wrong conclusions in hypothesis tests.

So putting it together:

i) Coefficient estimates may be misleading: Maybe not, unless in specific cases. So perhaps i is incorrect.

ii) Hypothesis tests could reach wrong conclusions: Correct, yes.

iii) Forecasts made from the model could be biased: Correct, because the model isn't properly capturing the relationships.

iv) Standard errors may be inappropriate: Correct.

So the statements ii, iii, and iv are correct.

Looking at the options, option D is (ii, iii, iv) only. But wait, I thought i might be incorrect. So the correct answer would include ii, iii, iv. So that's D.

Wait, but another angle. If the model has autocorrelation, the coefficient estimates are still unbiased. So statement i is incorrect because it says "may be misleading". So only ii, iii, iv are correct.

Looking back, the options are:

E includes all four, which I don't think because i may not be correct.

Looking at the options, D is "ii, iii, iv only", which would be correct.

When using OLS in the presence of autocorrelation, several consequences arise due to the violation of the assumption that error terms are uncorrelated. Here's the analysis of the given statements:

1. **Coefficient estimates may be misleading (i):** OLS coefficient estimates remain unbiased even in the presence of autocorrelation. However, they become inefficient, meaning their variance increases. While this makes them less reliable, they are not inherently "misleading" in terms of being biased. Therefore, this statement is likely incorrect.

2. **Hypothesis tests could reach the wrong conclusions (ii):** Autocorrelation affects the calculation of standard errors, making them unreliable. This, in turn, affects the validity of t and F tests, leading to potential type I or type II errors. Thus, hypothesis tests could indeed reach incorrect conclusions, making this statement correct.

3. **Forecasts made from the model could be biased (iii):** Autocorrelation can lead to inaccurate forecasts because the model fails to account for the patterns in the data introduced by autocorrelation. This makes the forecasts less reliable and potentially biased. Hence, this statement is correct.

4. **Standard errors may be inappropriate (iv):** Autocorrelation leads to miscalculation of standard errors, which can be either underestimated or overestimated. This makes inference based on these standard errors unreliable. Therefore, this statement is correct.

Based on this analysis, the correct statements are ii, iii, and iv. The correct option is:

**D: (ii), (iii), and (iv) only**.
