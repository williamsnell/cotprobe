Okay, so I've got this question about capacitors here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my electronics, but I'll try to think it through. The question says that the plates of a capacitor are charged to a potential difference of 5 volts, and the capacitance is 2 mF. I need to find the charge on the positive plate. The options are from A to J, but I'll focus on figuring it out first.

Alright, I remember that the basic formula for capacitors is Q = CV. Wait, is that right? Yeah, Q stands for charge, C is capacitance, and V is voltage. So the charge on the capacitor is equal to the capacitance multiplied by the voltage across it.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I get the units right. The capacitance is given as 2 mF. Oh right, milli is 10^-3, so 2 mF is 0.002 farads. Or wait, no, mF is milli, which is 1e-3. So 2 mF = 2 * 1e-3 F = 0.002 F.

The voltage is 5 volts. So plugging into Q = CV, that's 0.002 F multiplied by 5 V. Let me calculate that. 0.002 times 5 is 0.01. So Q is 0.01 coulombs.

Wait, but the options are in different units. Let me check the options again. Option I is 0.01 C, which matches what I just calculated. But wait, looking at the options, option B is 0.02 C, which is double what I got. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Let me double-check the calculation. 2 mF is 0.002 F. 0.002 F * 5 V = 0.01 C. That seems right. So the charge should be 0.01 C, which is option I.

Wait another thing. Oh wait, capacitors store equal and opposite charges on their plates. So the positive plate has +Q and the negative has -Q. But the question specifically asks for the charge on the positive plate, which is +0.01 C. So that's correct.

I think I'm confident with that. So the answer should be option I.

To determine the charge on the positive plate of the capacitor, we use the formula:

\[
Q = CV
\]

Where:
- \( Q \) is the charge,
- \( C \) is the capacitance,
- \( V \) is the potential difference (voltage).

The given values are:
- \( C = 2 \, \text{mF} = 2 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{F} = 0.002 \, \text{F} \),
- \( V = 5 \, \text{V} \).

Substituting into the formula:

\[
Q = 0.002 \, \text{F} \times 5 \, \text{V} = 0.01 \, \text{C}
\]

Thus, the charge on the positive plate is \( 0.01 \, \text{C} \). Among the options provided, this corresponds to option **I**.
