Okay, so I've got this economics question here about the equilibrium price of corn in a competitive market. Hmm, I need to figure out which option definitely increases the equilibrium price. Let me think through each option step by step.

The question is asking what definitely increases the equilibrium price. Equilibrium price is where supply equals demand. So, any change that makes the price go up must be something that either increases demand, decreases supply, or both.

Let me look at each option one by one.

Option A: Supply increases; demand remains constant. If supply increases, that means the supply curve shifts to the right. More supply at every price. So at the original equilibrium price, there's now excess supply. The price should fall to find a new equilibrium where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded again. So this would decrease the equilibrium price, not increase it. So A is not the right answer.

Option B: Supply shifts to the left; demand shifts to the right. Okay, supply shifting left is a decrease in supplyâ€”that should increase prices because there's less available at each price. Demand shifting right is an increase in demand, which also tends to increase price. So both shifts are pushing the price up. So B seems like a possible correct answer.

Option C: Both supply and demand remain constant. If neither changes, the equilibrium price stays the same. So no change. C is out.

Option D: Demand shifts to the left; supply remains constant. If demand decreases, the demand curve moves left. At every price, people want to buy less. So the equilibrium price should decrease. So D isn't correct.

Option E: Supply shifts to the right; demand shifts to the left. Supply increasing and demand decreasing. Both shifts would tend to decrease the equilibrium price. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Both supply and demand shift rightward. So supply increases and demand increases. The effect on price isn't clear because it depends on which shift is bigger. If demand increases a lot and supply only a little, price might go up. If supply increases more, price might go down. So it's not definite. So F doesn't definitely increase price.

Option G: Both supply and demand shift leftward. Here, supply decreases and demand decreases. Again, the effect on price depends. If demand decreases a lot, even with supply down, maybe price drops. Or if supply decreases more, maybe price goes up. So it's not certain. So G isn't the answer.

Option H: Supply increases; demand decreases. So supply shifting right (increase) and demand shifting left (decrease). Similar to option E and F. The effect on price depends on the magnitude. If supply increases a lot and demand decreases a little, price might go down. If demand decreases a lot and supply a little, maybe price goes up. So H doesn't definitely increase price.

Wait, let me go back to option B. Supply shifts left (decrease) and demand shifts right (increase). Both factors lead to higher prices. So that's a definite increase. So B must be the correct answer.

I think I've covered all the options. So the answer is B.

To determine which option definitely increases the equilibrium price of corn, we analyze the effects of shifts in supply and demand. The equilibrium price is where supply equals demand, so any change that increases demand, decreases supply, or both will raise the equilibrium price.

- **Option A**: An increase in supply (shift right) with constant demand leads to excess supply, lowering the equilibrium price. Incorrect.  
- **Option B**: A decrease in supply (shift left) and an increase in demand (shift right) both push the price up. This is a definite increase in equilibrium price. Correct.  
- **Option C**: If both supply and demand remain constant, the equilibrium price stays the same. Incorrect.  
- **Option D**: A decrease in demand (shift left) with constant supply reduces the equilibrium price. Incorrect.  
- **Option E**: An increase in supply (shift right) and a decrease in demand (shift left) both push the price down. Incorrect.  
- **Option F**: Both supply and demand shifting rightward may not definitively increase the price, as the effect depends on the relative magnitudes of the shifts. Incorrect.  
- **Option G**: Both supply and demand shifting leftward also lacks a definite effect on price, as it depends on which shift is larger. Incorrect.  
- **Option H**: An increase in supply (shift right) and a decrease in demand (shift left) have an uncertain effect on price, depending on the magnitudes of the shifts. Incorrect.  

The only option that guarantees an increase in the equilibrium price is **Option B**, where supply decreases and demand increases. 

Answer: B
