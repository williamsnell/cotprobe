Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about genetic variation, and I'm a bit new to this topic. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is asking which statement is true concerning genetic variation. The options are A through J. I'll need to go through each option and see which ones make sense based on what I remember from my biology classes.

First, I should recall what genetic variation means. From what I remember, genetic variation refers to the differences in the genetic makeup of individuals within a population. These differences can arise from mutations, gene recombination during meiosis, and gene flow from other populations. 

Now, let's look at each option:

Option A: It is created by the direct action of natural selection.
Hmm, wait. I think natural selection acts on existing variation, not creates it. Natural selection is the process where traits that are beneficial become more common because the individuals with those traits are more likely to survive and reproduce. So natural selection doesn't create the variation, it just selects for certain traits. So A is probably false.

Option B: It tends to be reduced by the processes involved when diploid organisms produce gametes.
When diploid organisms produce gametes, meiosis happens, which includes crossing over and independent assortment. These processes actually increase genetic variation by shuffling the genes. So B says it reduces variation, which doesn't sound right. Unless maybe if it's talking about something else, like if gamete production doesn't involve these processes? But no, in general, gamete production increases variation. So B is probably incorrect.

Option C: It must be present in a population before natural selection can act upon the population.
This makes sense because natural selection can't act without variation. If all individuals are the same, there's nothing for selection to choose. So natural selection operates on existing variation, favoring certain traits. Therefore, C seems correct.

Option D: It is always increased by the processes involved when diploid organisms produce gametes.
Well, usually, gamete production (meiosis) increases variation due to crossing over and such. But does it always increase? I think in some cases, like if there's no crossing over or if all the gametes are the same, maybe variation doesn't increase. But wait, even without crossing over, independent assortment during gamete formation can lead to different combinations. So maybe D is not correct because it says "always." For example, in asexual reproduction, gametes might not show variation, but the question is about diploid organisms producing gametes, which is sexual reproduction. Hmm, perhaps D is incorrect because sometimes it might not increase if the parents are homozygous for certain traits. Wait, but even if parents are homozygous, like AA and AA, their gametes would all be A, so no variation in that gene, but that's just for one gene. But looking at the whole genome, there's still variation elsewhere. So maybe in some specific cases, it doesn't increase for a particular gene, but overall, it does. So I'm a bit confused here. I'll have to think again later.

Option E: It is not affected by the environmental changes.
Wait, environmental changes can influence selection, but does the environment directly cause genetic variation? I think mutation rates can be influenced by environmental factors, like exposure to mutagens. So E is probably false because the environment can affect variation through mutations. But wait, is that the case? Or is it that the environment causes selection pressures, not the variation itself. Hmm, maybe E is incorrect because environmental changes don't directly create genetic variations, but they might lead to selection. Alternatively, some mutations could be caused by environmental factors. So E's statement says "it is not affected" which would be incorrect if environment does affect variation. So E is false.

Option F: It can only be created by artificial selection.
No, that's not right. Genetic variation arises from mutations, recombination, etc., not just artificial selection. So F is incorrect.

Option G: It is only present in a population after natural selection has acted upon the population.
No, variation exists before natural selection. Selection acts on existing variation, so G is wrong.

Option H: It arises independently of changes in the environment.
Well, mutations can occur randomly, regardless of the environment. However, some environmental factors might cause mutations, like UV light. So H is partially correct, but not entirely. Because some variations arise due to environmental factors. So H is incorrect.

Option I: It is always reduced by the processes involved when diploid organisms produce gametes.
Wait, no, gamete production usually increases variation. So I is incorrect.

Option J: It arises in response to changes in the environment.
That's not right either. Variations arise randomly, not necessarily as a response to environmental changes. So J is incorrect.

Now, going back to the options. So C is looking correct because variation must be present before selection can act. Natural selection doesn't create variation, it just selects from what's there.

Wait, what about option B and D? Both are about gamete production. I thought that gamete production increases variation due to crossing over and independent assortment. So, processes like meiosis increase genetic variation in the gametes. So the statement that variation is reduced by gamete production (B and I) would be wrong. So both B and I are incorrect. And D says "always increased", which may not be entirely correct because in some cases, it doesn't increase, but for most cases, it does. But the question is about a true statement, so if there's any case where it doesn't increase, then D is incorrect.

Wait, when gametes are produced, even if parents are homozygous for a gene, they can still produce gametes that vary in other genes. So overall, for the population, genetic variation is increased. So perhaps D is making a generalization that isn't always true. For example, if a population is already highly diverse, gamete production might not change that much, but it's not always the case. Hmm, perhaps D is incorrect because it's an absolute statement.

So, the correct answer seems to be option C: It must be present in a population before natural selection can act upon the population. That makes sense because without variation, there's nothing for natural selection to select. So natural selection can't occur without pre-existing variation.

To determine the correct answer, we analyze each option based on the concept of genetic variation, which refers to differences in the genetic makeup of individuals within a population. Genetic variation arises from mutations, gene recombination during meiosis, and gene flow. Natural selection acts on existing variation, favoring certain traits, but does not create variation itself.

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Natural selection does not create genetic variation; it acts on existing variation.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Gamete production through meiosis typically increases genetic variation due to processes like crossing over and independent assortment, rather than reducing it.
- **Option C**: Correct. Genetic variation must exist in a population before natural selection can act, as selection operates on pre-existing differences.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. While gamete production often increases genetic variation, it is not always the case (e.g., in homozygous individuals for certain traits). The use of "always" makes this statement false.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. Environmental changes can influence genetic variation indirectly, such as through mutation-inducing factors like UV radiation.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Genetic variation arises from mutations, recombination, and gene flow, not solely from artificial selection.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Genetic variation exists before natural selection acts; selection does not create variation.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. While some genetic variation arises randomly, environmental factors can also influence variation (e.g., through mutagens).
- **Option I**: Incorrect. Gamete production generally increases genetic variation rather than reducing it.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. Genetic variation arises randomly and is not a direct response to environmental changes.

The correct answer is **C**, as genetic variation must be present in a population before natural selection can act.
