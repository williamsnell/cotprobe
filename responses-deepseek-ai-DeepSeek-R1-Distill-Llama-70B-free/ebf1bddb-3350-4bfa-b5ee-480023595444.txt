Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question is about an automobile service station that does oil changes and tire replacements, among other services. The probabilities are given as 60% for oil changes, 30% for tire replacements, and 10% for both. Then, the question is: if a customer requests an oil change, what's the probability they don't request tire replacements?

Hmm. So, let me break this down. I think this is a conditional probability problem. The formula I remember for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B). But wait, in this case, we're looking for the probability that someone who gets an oil change doesn't get tire replacements. So maybe it's better to think in terms of sets.

Let me define the events first. Let O be the event that a customer requests an oil change, and T be the event that they request tire replacements. According to the problem, P(O) is 60% or 0.6, P(T) is 30% or 0.3, and P(O and T) is 10% or 0.1.

Wait, but wait a second. If 60% get oil changes and 30% get tires, and 10% get both, does that add up? Let me check. If P(O) is 0.6 and P(T) is 0.3, the maximum possible for P(O and T) can't be more than the smallest of the two, which is 0.3, but here it's 0.1, which is fine. So that seems okay.

Now, the question is, given that a customer is in the oil change group (O), what's the probability they are not in the tire replacement group (T). So, we're looking for P(not T | O).

I think the formula for conditional probability of not T given O would be 1 minus P(T | O). Because the probabilities of T and not T given O must add up to 1.

So first, I need to find P(T | O), the probability that a customer who gets an oil change also gets tire replacements.

Using the conditional probability formula: P(T | O) = P(O and T) / P(O). So that's 0.1 / 0.6. Let me calculate that. 0.1 divided by 0.6 equals approximately 0.1667. So about 16.67%.

Therefore, P(not T | O) would be 1 - 0.1667, which equals 0.8333 or 83.33%.

Looking at the options, I see option I is 0.833, which matches. So the answer should be I.

Wait, let me double-check in case I made a mistake. Another way to think about it is using a Venn diagram. Imagine a circle for oil changes (60%) and another for tires (30%). The overlap is 10%, so the oil change circle has 60% total, with 10% overlapping. So the part of the oil change circle that doesn't overlap with tires is 60% - 10% = 50%. So the probability that a customer is in the oil change part not overlapping with tires is 50% out of the total oil change customers (60%). So 50% / 60% is 5/6, which is approximately 0.8333. Yep, that's the same as before.

So I'm confident that the correct answer is I.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that a customer who requests an oil change does not request tire replacements. Letâ€™s define the events:

- **O**: Customer requests an oil change.  
- **T**: Customer requests tire replacements.  

From the problem, we know:  
- \( P(O) = 0.6 \)  
- \( P(T) = 0.3 \)  
- \( P(O \cap T) = 0.1 \)  

We are tasked with finding \( P(\text{not } T | O) \), the probability that a customer who requests an oil change does not request tire replacements. Using the rules of probability, we know:  
\[
P(\text{not } T | O) = 1 - P(T | O)
\]  

First, calculate \( P(T | O) \), the probability that a customer who requests an oil change also requests tire replacements. Using the conditional probability formula:  
\[
P(T | O) = \frac{P(O \cap T)}{P(O)} = \frac{0.1}{0.6} \approx 0.1667
\]  

Now, substitute this into the equation for \( P(\text{not } T | O) \):  
\[
P(\text{not } T | O) = 1 - 0.1667 = 0.8333
\]  

Thus, the probability that a customer who requests an oil change does not request tire replacements is approximately **0.833**. Comparing this to the options provided, the correct answer is:  

**I: 0.833**
