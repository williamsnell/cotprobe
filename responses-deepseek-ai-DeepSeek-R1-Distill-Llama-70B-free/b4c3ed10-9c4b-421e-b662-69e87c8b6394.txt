Okay, I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Milgram's obedience experiments. I remember that Milgram's study was about how ordinary people could be influenced to obey authority figures, even when it goes against their conscience. The question is asking what percentage of participants thought they delivered the maximum shock possible.

So, from what I recall, in Milgram's experiments, participants were asked to administer electric shocks to another person (who was actually an actor) each time they answered a question wrong. The shocks increased in voltage each time. The key point was seeing how far the participants would go, with the prods from the authority figure (the experimenter) encouraging them to continue.

I think the maximum shock was 450 volts, labeled as "XXX" or something like that, and it was the highest on the board. Now, the results showed that a significant number of participants went all the way to the end. But the question is specifically about how many thought they delivered the maximum shock.

Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Because in the experiment, the participants were deceived into thinking the shocks were real. But the actual data I remember is that about 65% of the participants administered the maximum shock. But that's the percentage of people who actually went through with it, not necessarily what they thought about it afterwards.

Wait, no, the question is about what percentage thought they delivered the maximum. So maybe after the experiment, when they were debriefed, some participants might have realized they didn't go all the way, or perhaps the opposite.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the percentage who actually administered the maximum shock, which is around 65%, but looking at the options, I don't see 65. The closest options are 60 (B), 70 (I), or maybe 30 (D).

Wait, another angle: the participants were unaware that the shocks weren't real. So when they pressed the button for 450 volts, they believed they were administering a fatal shock. But in reality, they didn't deliver any real shocks. So the question is, how many thought they delivered the maximum possible (which was 450 volts).

So in terms of the percentage who went all the way, it's about 65% of men in the original study. But the options don't have 65. So perhaps the closest is 60 or 70.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "thought they delivered the maximum amount of shock possible." So maybe the participants themselves, after the study, were asked if they thought they administered the maximum. Or perhaps it's the percentage of participants who actually went to the maximum.

Wait, I think the actual figure was that about 65% of participants went all the way to 450 volts. So looking at the options, the closest would be 60% (option B) or 70% (option I). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the percentage who thought they delivered the maximum, not the actual percentage who did. But I'm not sure about that data point.

Another thought: maybe the maximum was 450 volts, but some participants stopped before that. So among those who went all the way, they would have thought they delivered the maximum. So the percentage would be the same as those who went to 450 volts, which is about 65%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is 60% or 70%.

Wait, looking at the options: A is 100, which can't be right because not everyone went all the way. B is 60, which is close to 65. C is 80, which seems too high. D is 30, which is lower than the actual figure. E is 0, no. F is 40, G is 90, H is50, I is70, J is20.

Wait, I'm pretty sure the obedience rate was around 65%, so the closest options are B (60) and I (70). But perhaps the correct answer is 65%, but since it's not present, the intended answer is either 60 or 70.

Alternatively, maybe the question refers to a different aspect. Wait, perhaps the maximum shock was 450 volts, and in the experiment, 26 out of 40 participants went to 450, so 65%. But the options don't have 65, so perhaps the intended answer is 60 or 70.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to a different variation of the experiment. Maybe in some variations, the percentage was lower. But I think the classic result is around 65%.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is about how many thought they delivered the maximum shock, which could be different from those who actually did. But I don't recall specific data on that.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is about the percentage who thought they delivered the maximum. But in the experiment, all participants who went to 450 volts would have thought they delivered the maximum. So the percentage would be the same as those who administered the 450-volt shock.

So if 65% did that, but the options don't have 65, the closest is B (60) or I (70). Since 65 is closer to 65, but the options don't have that, perhaps it's intended to approximate to 60 or 70. Wait, 65 is closer to 60 or 70? 65 is 5 away from 60 and 5 away from 70. It's equidistant.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 65, but the options don't have it, so maybe the intended answer is 60 or 70. But I'm not sure which. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to another aspect.

Wait, I think the correct answer is that about 65% went all the way, so perhaps the intended option is I:70, but that's a bit higher. Or perhaps the answer is 60%, option B.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is about the percentage who thought they delivered the maximum, meaning they believed they had given the highest possible shock, which would include those who went up to 450 volts. So the percentage is the same as those who went to 450, which is 65%. But since 65 isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is I:70.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is 100%, but that's not correct because not all participants went to 450. So A is 100, which is wrong.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The original Milgram experiment had about 65% of participants administering the 450-volt shock. So the answer should be approximately 65%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is 60% (B) or 70% (I). Alternatively, perhaps the question is slightly different.

Wait, perhaps the question is about how many thought they delivered the maximum, but actually didn't. But I don't think that's the case. The question is straightforward: of the participants, approximately what percentage thought they delivered the maximum shock possible.

So, if 65% delivered the maximum, then they thought they did. So the answer would be approximately 65%, but it's not an option. So perhaps the closest is B:60 or I:70.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the question is referring to a specific variation of the experiment. For example, in the original baseline study, it was 65%, but in some variations, the percentage was lower or higher. But I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 100% because all participants went up to the maximum, but that's incorrect because not everyone did.

Wait, I think I'll have to go with the option closest to 65%, which would be either 60 or 70. Since 65 is exactly between 60 and 70, but perhaps the answer expects 65 to be approximated as 60 because 65 is closer to 60 than to 70? No, 65 is equidistant from both.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer expects 65% to be rounded to 70%, making option I the correct choice. Or maybe the intended answer is 60% because the question says "approximately," and 60 is an approximate figure.

Wait, I'm not sure. But I think the correct answer is that approximately 65% of participants administered the maximum shock, so the closest option would be either B (60) or I (70). But since 65 is not an option, perhaps the intended answer is I:70, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is referring to the percentage who thought they delivered the maximum, but didn't actually do it. No, that doesn't make sense because the participants who went to 450 volts would have thought they delivered the maximum. So if 65% did that, then 65% thought they did.

But since 65 isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is 60% (B). Alternatively, I might have misremembered the exact percentage.

Wait, let me try to recall: I think in the original study, 26 out of 40 participants went to 450 volts. 26/40 is 65%. So that's the figure.

Looking back at the options, the closest is either B (60) or I (70). Since 65 is not present, perhaps the intended answer is 60%, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe it's 100% because they all thought they delivered the maximum, but that can't be right because not all went to 450.

Wait, perhaps the question is phrased differently. It's asking what percentage thought they delivered the maximum, not the percentage that actually did. So maybe some participants thought they delivered the maximum even if they stopped earlier. But I don't think that's the case. The maximum was clearly labeled, so participants would know whether they went all the way or not.

So, the answer should be the same as the percentage that actually delivered the maximum, which is 65%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is 60% or 70%.

I think I'll go with option I:70 as the closest, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 60%.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the exact figure. I think in the original Milgram experiment, 65% of participants (26/40) administered the 450-volt shock. So the percentage is 65%. But the options don't have 65, so perhaps the intended answer is 60 or 70.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a different aspect, such as the percentage who thought they could go beyond 450 volts, but that seems unlikely.

I'm a bit stuck, but I think the intended answer is 60%, so option B. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 100%, but that's not correct.

Wait, no, because the maximum was 450, so those who went to 450 would have thought they delivered the maximum. So 65% is the correct figure, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is 60%.

I think I'll go with option B:60%.

The question asks what percentage of participants in Milgram's obedience experiments thought they delivered the maximum amount of shock possible. In Milgram's original study, approximately 65% of participants administered the maximum shock of 450 volts. However, since 65% is not one of the provided options, the closest approximations are 60% (option B) and 70% (option I). Given that 65% is equidistant from both 60% and 70%, the intended answer is likely 60%, as it is a reasonable approximation.

Answer: B
