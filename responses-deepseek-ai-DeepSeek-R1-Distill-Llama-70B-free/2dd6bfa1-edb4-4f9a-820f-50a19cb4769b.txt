Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating interest on a loan. Let's see what it's asking. Paul is borrowing $823 for 60 days, and the interest rate is 4% per year. They want to compute the interest using the exact time method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

First, I remember that interest can be calculated using the simple interest formula. The basic formula is I = P * r * t, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, r is the annual interest rate, and t is the time in years. Oh wait, but here the time is given in days, so I'll need to convert that into a fraction of a year.

The problem says it's a 60-day loan. Since there are 365 days in a year, the time t would be 60 divided by 365. Let me write that down: t = 60/365. But wait, sometimes banks use 360 days for calculations, but the question specifies the exact time method, which I think uses 365 days. Yeah, exact time probably means using the actual number of days, so 365 it is.

The principal P is $823, and the rate r is 4% per year, which is 0.04 in decimal. So plugging these into the formula: I = 823 * 0.04 * (60/365).

Let me calculate this step by step. First, calculate 0.04 times 823. 0.04 is 4%, so 4% of 823. Let's see, 1% of 823 is 8.23, so 4% is 4 times that, which is 32.92. So 823 * 0.04 is 32.92.

Now multiply that by 60/365. So 32.92 * (60/365). Let's compute 60/365 first. 60 divided by 365, well, 365 divided by 60 is about 6.083, so 60/365 is approximately 0.1644.

Wait, wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 60 divided by 365. Let's see, 365 goes into 60 zero times. 365 goes into 600 once (365*1=365), remainder 235. Bring down a zero: 2350. 365*6=2190, so 6 times, remainder 160. So 60/365 is approximately 0.16438356.

So 32.92 multiplied by 0.16438356. Let me compute that. Hmm, 32.92 * 0.16 is 5.2672, and 32.92 * 0.00438356 is about 32.92 * 0.004 is 0.13168, and 32.92 * 0.00038356 is roughly 0.01263. Adding those together: 5.2672 + 0.13168 is 5.39888, plus 0.01263 gives about 5.4115. So approximately $5.41.

Wait, but let me double-check that calculation to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator-like approach.

Alternatively, I can compute 32.92 * 60 = 1975.2. Then divide that by 365. So 1975.2 / 365. Let's compute that.

365 goes into 1975. Let's see: 365 * 5 = 1825. Subtracting that from 1975 gives 150.2. Now, 365 goes into 150.2 about 0.411 times because 365 * 0.4 is 146, so 0.411 is approximately 150. So 5.411. So the interest is approximately $5.41.

Looking at the options, option I is $5.41. So I think the answer is I.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations. Let me go through it again.

P = $823, r = 4% per annum, t = 60 days.

t in years is 60/365.

I = 823 * 0.04 * (60/365).

Compute 823 * 0.04 first: 823 * 0.04 = 32.92.

Then, 32.92 * (60/365) = ?

32.92 * 60 = 1975.2.

1975.2 divided by 365 equals?

Let me compute 365 * 5 = 1825.

1975.2 - 1825 = 150.2.

Now, 365 * 0.4 = 146.

150.2 - 146 = 4.2.

So 4.2 / 365 = approximately 0.0115.

So total is 5 + 0.4 + 0.0115 = 5.4115.

So yes, approximately $5.41. So option I is correct.

To calculate the interest Paul will pay on a 60-day loan of $823 at 4% per year using the exact time method, we use the simple interest formula:

\[
I = P \cdot r \cdot t
\]

Where:
- \( P = 823 \) (principal amount),
- \( r = 0.04 \) (annual interest rate),
- \( t = \frac{60}{365} \) (time in years, since the exact time method uses 365 days).

### Step 1: Calculate \( t \)
\[
t = \frac{60}{365} \approx 0.1644
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( I \)
\[
I = 823 \cdot 0.04 \cdot 0.1644
\]

First, compute \( 823 \cdot 0.04 \):
\[
823 \cdot 0.04 = 32.92
\]

Next, multiply \( 32.92 \) by \( 0.1644 \):
\[
32.92 \cdot 0.1644 \approx 5.41
\]

Thus, the interest Paul will pay is approximately **$5.41**.

### Final Answer:
I
