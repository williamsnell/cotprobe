Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it.

So, there's a cylinder divided into two equal parts by a piston. Each part is 100 cm³, and the cross-sectional area of the piston is 15 cm². Initially, both parts have gas at 27°C. Then, one part is heated to 100°C while the other stays at 27°C. The piston and walls are insulators, so no heat is exchanged through them. I need to find out how far the piston moves.

Hmm, okay. So, since the walls are insulators, the process is adiabatic for each gas? Wait, no, I think that's not right. Because each side is either heated or kept at the same temperature. Wait, but the piston is a perfect insulator, so heat can't transfer through it. So each gas sample is either heated or not, but they can exchange work.

Wait, each gas is in its own compartment. The piston allows the two gases to push against each other. So, when one side is heated, it will expand, pushing the piston and compressing the other side.

But wait, the problem says the piston is a perfect insulator, so there's no heat exchange between the two parts. So each part's temperature change is independent. So, one part is heated, and the other isn't. So, the hot gas will expand, and the piston will move until the pressures on both sides equalize again.

So the key here is that the system will reach a new equilibrium where the pressures in both parts are equal. So I can model this as each gas expanding or compressing, but in such a way that their pressures balance.

Wait, but each gas is confined to its own side. Oh wait, no. The piston is movable, so the volumes can change. So the initial volume of each is 100 cm³, but when one expands, the other is compressed.

Wait, but the cross-sectional area is given, so the movement of the piston (distance moved) multiplied by the area will give the change in volume for each side.

Okay, initial state: both sides have volume V1 = V2 = 100 cm³. The temperature of both is T1 = T2 = 27°C, which is 300 K.

After heating, one side (let's say side A) is at T_A = 100°C = 373 K, and side B remains at T_B = 300 K.

Since the piston is a perfect insulator, each gas's process is adiabatic? Or not? Wait, for side A, we're adding heat externally because we're changing its temperature. So that might imply that side A undergoes an isobaric process or something else. Wait, but how is the temperature change happening? Because the problem says the gas in one part is raised in temperature; perhaps it's done by an external heat source, but the piston is insulating, so heat doesn't transfer between the two gases.

So each gas's temperature is changed independently, but the system as a whole has to equilibrate the pressure.

Wait, maybe each gas undergoes a process where their temperatures change, and their volumes change as the piston moves, but the pressure equilibrates. So, at equilibrium, P_A = P_B.

Since the piston is movable, the volumes will adjust until the pressures are equal.

So, for each gas, we can model their states before and after the process.

Initially, pressure is the same in both sides, let's say P_initial.

But after heating, each gas will have a new pressure based on their new temperatures and volumes.

Wait, but the process for each gas isn't necessarily an ideal process like isothermal or adiabatic because the movement of the piston allows work to be done, and heat is being added only to one side.

Wait, but perhaps we can model each gas as undergoing a process where their temperature changes, and their volume changes, but the pressure adjusts until they match.

Assuming ideal gas behavior, we can use the ideal gas law: PV = nRT.

Since the number of moles n doesn't change for each gas (the piston doesn't allow gas to move between the two sides), we can consider each side's gas separately.

Let me denote:

For gas A (heated):
Initial state: V_A1 = 100 cm³, T_A1 = 300 K, P_A1 = P_initial.
Final state: V_A2 = V_A1 + ΔV (if it expands), T_A2 = 373 K, P_A2 = P_final.

For gas B (not heated):
Initial state: V_B1 = 100 cm³, T_B1 = 300 K, P_B1 = P_initial.
Final state: V_B2 = V_B1 - ΔV (if it's compressed), T_B2 = 300 K, P_B2 = P_final.

Wait, but when the piston moves, the volume of A increases by ΔV, and the volume of B decreases by ΔV. Because the total volume is fixed? No, wait, the total volume of the cylinder is 200 cm³, so moving the piston by distance d will change each volume by area * d.

Wait, cross-sectional area is 15 cm². So, if the piston moves a distance d (in cm), the volume change for each side is 15 * d cm³. So, for gas A, if the piston moves to the right (assuming A is on the left), then A's volume increases by 15d, and B's decreases by 15d.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the piston moves which way. If A is heated, it will expand, pushing the piston into B's side, so B's volume decreases.

So, the final volumes would be:
V_A = 100 + 15d
V_B = 100 - 15d

Because if the piston moves d cm to the right, the left volume increases by 15d, and the right decreases by 15d.

Now, the final pressures must be equal: P_A = P_B.

So, write the ideal gas equation for each in the final state.

For gas A:
P_final * V_A = n_A R T_A2
But initially, n_A R = (P_initial * V_A1)/ T_A1 = (P_initial * 100) / 300.

So, substituting:
P_final * (100 +15d) = (P_initial * 100 / 300) * 373.

Similarly for gas B:
P_final * V_B = n_B R T_B2
n_B R = (P_initial * 100) / 300.

So,
P_final * (100 -15d) = (P_initial * 100 / 300) * 300.

Simplify the equations.

For gas A:
P_final * (100 +15d) = (100 P_initial / 300 ) * 373
= (100 P_initial) * (373/300)
= 100 P_initial * (1.233333...)

So, P_final = [100 P_initial * 1.233333...] / (100 +15d)

For gas B:

P_final * (100 -15d) = 100 P_initial * (300/300) = 100 P_initial.

So, P_final = 100 P_initial / (100 -15d)

Now, since P_final is the same in both equations, set them equal:

[100 P_initial * 1.23333...] / (100 +15d) = 100 P_initial / (100-15d)

We can cancel 100 P_initial from both sides:

1.233333... / (100 +15d) = 1 / (100 -15d)

Cross-multiplying:

1.233333... * (100 -15d) = (100 +15d)

Let me compute 1.233333... as 370/300, but wait 373/300 is 1.243333..., wait wait 373 K is 100°C, and initial is 300 K, 27°C.

Wait, 373/300 is about 1.243333. Oh wait, in the equation for gas A, the temperature is 373 K, so 373/300 is 1.243333.

Wait, but in my earlier substitution, I used 373/300, which is correct.

So, back to the equation:

(373/300) * (100 -15d) = (100 +15d)

Multiply both sides by 300 to eliminate denominators:

373*(100 -15d) = 300*(100 +15d)

Let me compute each side:

Left: 373*100 = 37300; 373*(-15d) = -5595 d
So left = 37300 -5595d

Right: 300*100=30000; 300*15d=4500d
So right =30000 +4500d

Now, equation becomes:

37300 -5595d = 30000 +4500d

Bring variables to one side:

37300 -30000 = 4500d +5595d

7300 = 10095 d

So d = 7300 / 10095 ≈ 0.723 cm.

Wait, that's one of the options. Let me check the options.

Looking back: option E is 0.723 cm.

So the answer should be E.

To solve the problem, we analyze the system using the ideal gas law and the fact that the piston moves until the pressures on both sides of the piston equalize. Initially, both sides of the piston have equal volumes (\(V_1 = V_2 = 100 \, \text{cm}^3\)) and equal pressures (\(P_1 = P_2 = P_{\text{initial}}\)) at a temperature of \(T_1 = T_2 = 300 \, \text{K}\). After heating, one side (gas A) is at \(T_A = 373 \, \text{K}\), while the other side (gas B) remains at \(T_B = 300 \, \text{K}\). The piston moves a distance \(d\), changing the volumes of the two gases: \(V_A = 100 + 15d\) and \(V_B = 100 - 15d\), where the cross-sectional area of the piston is \(15 \, \text{cm}^2\).

Using the ideal gas law (\(PV = nRT\)) for each gas, we know that the number of moles (\(n\)) does not change for either gas. Thus, the pressure in each gas can be expressed as:

\[
P_{\text{final}} = \frac{nRT}{V}
\]

For gas A (heated):
\[
P_{\text{final}} = \frac{n_A R T_A}{V_A} = \frac{\frac{P_{\text{initial}} V_1}{T_1} R T_A}{V_A}
\]
Substituting \(V_A = 100 + 15d\), \(T_A = 373 \, \text{K}\), \(T_1 = 300 \, \text{K}\), and \(V_1 = 100 \, \text{cm}^3\):
\[
P_{\text{final}} = \frac{P_{\text{initial}} \cdot 100 \cdot 373}{300 \cdot (100 + 15d)}
\]

For gas B (unchanged temperature):
\[
P_{\text{final}} = \frac{n_B R T_B}{V_B} = \frac{\frac{P_{\text{initial}} V_1}{T_1} R T_B}{V_B}
\]
Substituting \(V_B = 100 - 15d\), \(T_B = 300 \, \text{K}\), \(T_1 = 300 \, \text{K}\), and \(V_1 = 100 \, \text{cm}^3\):
\[
P_{\text{final}} = \frac{P_{\text{initial}} \cdot 100 \cdot 300}{300 \cdot (100 - 15d)}
\]

Since the pressures must equalize (\(P_{\text{final}}\) is the same for both gases), we set the two expressions equal:
\[
\frac{P_{\text{initial}} \cdot 100 \cdot 373}{300 \cdot (100 + 15d)} = \frac{P_{\text{initial}} \cdot 100 \cdot 300}{300 \cdot (100 - 15d)}
\]

Canceling \(P_{\text{initial}} \cdot 100 \cdot 300\) from both sides:
\[
\frac{373}{100 + 15d} = \frac{300}{100 - 15d}
\]

Cross-multiplying:
\[
373 \cdot (100 - 15d) = 300 \cdot (100 + 15d)
\]

Expanding both sides:
\[
37300 - 5595d = 30000 + 4500d
\]

Rearranging terms:
\[
7300 = 10095d
\]

Solving for \(d\):
\[
d = \frac{7300}{10095} \approx 0.723 \, \text{cm}
\]

Thus, the piston moves approximately \(0.723 \, \text{cm}\). The correct answer is:

**E: 0.723 cm**
