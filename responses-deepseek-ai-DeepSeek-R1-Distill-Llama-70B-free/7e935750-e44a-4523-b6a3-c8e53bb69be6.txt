Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find how many arithmetic sequences of consecutive odd integers sum up to 240. Hmm, arithmetic sequences... consecutive odd integers... wait, I remember that consecutive odd numbers form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2. So each term is 2 more than the previous one.

The question is about the number of such sequences that add up to 240. So I'm trying to figure out all possible sequences where each term is an odd number, they're consecutive, and their sum is 240.

Let me think about how to model this. Let's say the sequence starts with an odd number 'a' and has 'n' terms. Since the numbers are consecutive odd integers, each term increases by 2. So the sequence would be a, a+2, a+4, ..., up to a + 2(n-1).

The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by (n/2) * (2a + (n-1)*d), where d is the common difference. Here, d is 2, so plugging that in:

Sum = (n/2) * [2a + 2(n-1)]
Simplify that: (n/2)(2a + 2n - 2) = n(a + n - 1)

We know the sum is 240, so:

n(a + n - 1) = 240

I can rearrange this equation to solve for 'a' in terms of 'n':

a + n - 1 = 240 / n
So, a = (240 / n) - n + 1

But since 'a' has to be an odd integer, (240/n) must result in a number that, when subtracted by (n-1), gives an odd integer. Let's break this down.

Wait, 240 is the total sum, and n must be a divisor of 240 for (240/n) to be an integer, right? Because 'a' has to be an integer. Wait, no, not exactly. Because (240/n) doesn't have to be an integer on its own. Let me see: a = (240/n) - n +1. For 'a' to be an integer, (240/n) must be an integer because n and 1 are integers. So 240 must be divisible by n. So n must be a positive integer divisor of 240.

But wait, n also represents the number of terms in the sequence. So n must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.

So first, I can list all the positive divisors of 240 to find possible values of n.

Let me find the divisors of 240. 240 factors into 2^4 * 3 * 5. So the number of divisors is (4+1)(1+1)(1+1) =5*2*2=20. But I don't need to list all 20; perhaps I can find the possible n values.

Wait, but n must also be such that 'a' is positive and odd. Because we're talking about sequences of positive integers, I assume. Or wait, the problem doesn't specify whether the integers are positive or just odd. Hmm, but if the sum is positive (240), then the terms are probably positive. So 'a' must be a positive odd integer.

So for each divisor n of 240, I can compute a = (240/n) - n + 1 and check if 'a' is a positive odd integer.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, list all positive divisors of 240. Let's see:

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 20, 24, 30, 40, 48, 60, 80, 120, 240.

But wait, considering that the sequence must consist of consecutive odd integers, so each term must be odd. That means that 'a' must be odd, and each subsequent term increases by 2, so all terms are odd.

So for each possible n (divisor of 240), check if a is odd and positive.

Let me go through each possible n:

n must be a positive integer, so let's start from n=1.

n=1: a=240/1 -1 +1=240. 240 is even, so not acceptable. So this n is invalid.

n=2: 240/2=120. a=120 -2 +1=119. 119 is odd, positive. So this is valid. So n=2, a=119: sequence is 119, 121. Sum is 240.

n=3: 240/3=80. a=80-3+1=78. 78 is even. So invalid.

n=4: 240/4=60. a=60-4+1=57. 57 is odd. So valid. The sequence is 57,59,61,63.

n=5: 240/5=48. a=48-5+1=44. Even. So invalid.

n=6: 240/6=40. a=40-6+1=35. 35 is odd. Valid. So sequence starts at 35, six terms.

n=8: 240/8=30. a=30-8+1=23. 23 is odd. Valid.

n=10: 240/10=24. a=24-10+1=15. 15 is odd. Valid.

n=12: 240/12=20. a=20-12+1=9. 9 is odd. Valid.

n=15: 240/15=16. a=16-15+1=2. 2 is even. Invalid.

n=16: 240/16=15. a=15-16 +1=0. Zero is even. Also, the sequence must be positive integers, so a can't be zero. So invalid.

n=20: 240/20=12. a=12-20 +1= -7. Negative. So invalid.

n=24: 240/24=10. a=10-24+1=-13. Negative. Invalid.

n=30: 240/30=8. a=8-30+1 =-21. Negative.

n=40: 240/40=6. a=6-40+1= -33. Negative.

n=48: 240/48=5. a=5 -48 +1= -42. Negative.

n=60: 240/60=4. a=4-60+1=-55. Negative.

n=80: 240/80=3. a=3-80+1=-76. Negative.

n=120: 240/120=2. a=2-120 +1=-117. Negative.

n=240: 240/240=1. a=1-240+1= -238. Negative.

Wait, so for each n, I have to check if a is positive and odd.

Looking back, the valid n's where a is positive and odd are:

n=2: a=119 (valid)
n=4: a=57 (valid)
n=6: a=35 (valid)
n=8: a=23 (valid)
n=10: a=15 (valid)
n=12: a=9 (valid)

Wait, what about n=5? Let me double-check. Oh wait, n=5 gives a=44, which is even. So invalid.

Wait, let me count how many valid n's I have:

n=2 → valid
n=4 → valid
n=6 → valid
n=8 → valid
n=10 → valid
n=12 → valid

So that's 6 values of n. So 6 sequences.

Wait, but the options don't have 6 as the first option. Let me check the options again.

Options are: A:9, B:7, C:12, D:11, E:4, F:5, G:6, H:14, I:8, J:10.

So option G is 6. So would the answer be G?

Wait, but wait. Am I missing anything here? Let me think again.

Wait, maybe n can be even or odd, but does that affect anything else? Let me re-examine.

Wait, another approach: For the sum of consecutive odd numbers, the number of terms can be both even and odd, but the average (mean) of the sequence would be (sum)/(n) = 240/n. Since the average must be an integer (as each term is integer and the sum is 240), n must be a divisor of 240.

Wait, yes, that's correct. So n must divide 240, which is what I considered earlier.

But another point: Each term is odd. So the average (240/n) must be either odd or even? Let's see.

Wait, the average of consecutive odd integers: if there are an even number of terms, the average would be the average of the first and last term. Let me think: the first term is a (odd), and the last term is a + 2(n-1) (also odd). So the sum is (a + [a+2(n-1)]) * n/2.

Wait, when n is even, say n=2, the average is (a1 + a2)/2. Since a1 and a2 are both odd, their sum is even, so the average is integer.

Similarly, when n is odd, the average is the middle term, which is also an integer (since all terms are integers). So in all cases, 240/n must be an integer, which is why n must be a divisor of 240.

But I think I've already considered that. So my initial approach was correct.

Wait, but let me think again about the possible values of n. I listed n=2,4,6,8,10,12 as the valid ones, each giving a positive odd a.

Wait, but another thing: the number of terms can't be larger than the number that would make a positive. So when n exceeds a certain value, a becomes negative. As I saw, beyond n=12, a becomes negative, so we stop there.

So, possible n's are 2,4,6,8,10,12. That's six values. So the answer is 6, which is option G.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any. Let me recount the possible n's:

n=2 → a=119 → valid
n=4 → a=57 → valid
n=6 → a=35 → valid
n=8 → a=23 → valid
n=10 → a=15 → valid
n=12 → a=9 → valid
n=3 → a=78 → even, invalid
n=5 → a=44 → even, invalid
n=7 → wait, n=7 is a divisor of 240? Let me check: 240 ÷7 is about 34.28, which is not integer. So n=7 isn't a divisor, so I can ignore it.

Wait, wait a minute. Did I miss any n that is a divisor of 240? Let me recheck all the divisors.

Earlier, I listed the divisors as 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10,12,15,16,20,24,30,40,48,60,80,120,240.

Wait, for n=15: a=2, which is even and positive. So invalid.

n=16: a=0 → invalid.

n=20: a=-7 → invalid.

n=24: a=-13 → invalid.

n=30: a=-21 → invalid.

n=40: a=-33 → invalid.

n=48: a=-42 → invalid.

n=60: a=-55 → invalid.

n=80: a=-76 → invalid.

n=120: a=-117 → invalid.

n=240: a=-238 → invalid.

So, I have 6 valid n's: 2,4,6,8,10,12.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: if n is 1, a=240, which is even, so not acceptable. So only the six n's I found.

So the answer is 6, which is option G. So I think the correct answer is G.

To determine how many arithmetic sequences of consecutive odd integers sum to 240, we start by noting that such sequences form an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 2. Let the sequence start with an odd integer \(a\) and have \(n\) terms. The sum of the sequence is given by:

\[
\text{Sum} = n(a + n - 1)
\]

Since the sum is 240, we have:

\[
n(a + n - 1) = 240
\]

Rearranging for \(a\):

\[
a = \frac{240}{n} - n + 1
\]

For \(a\) to be a positive odd integer, \(\frac{240}{n}\) must be an integer, meaning \(n\) must be a divisor of 240. Additionally, \(a\) must be positive and odd. The divisors of 240 are:

\[
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 20, 24, 30, 40, 48, 60, 80, 120, 240
\]

We now check each divisor \(n\) to see if \(a\) is a positive odd integer:

- \(n = 1\): \(a = 240 - 1 + 1 = 240\) (even, invalid)
- \(n = 2\): \(a = 120 - 2 + 1 = 119\) (odd, valid)
- \(n = 3\): \(a = 80 - 3 + 1 = 78\) (even, invalid)
- \(n = 4\): \(a = 60 - 4 + 1 = 57\) (odd, valid)
- \(n = 5\): \(a = 48 - 5 + 1 = 44\) (even, invalid)
- \(n = 6\): \(a = 40 - 6 + 1 = 35\) (odd, valid)
- \(n = 8\): \(a = 30 - 8 + 1 = 23\) (odd, valid)
- \(n = 10\): \(a = 24 - 10 + 1 = 15\) (odd, valid)
- \(n = 12\): \(a = 20 - 12 + 1 = 9\) (odd, valid)
- \(n = 15\): \(a = 16 - 15 + 1 = 2\) (even, invalid)
- \(n = 16\): \(a = 15 - 16 + 1 = 0\) (invalid, non-positive)
- \(n = 20\): \(a = 12 - 20 + 1 = -7\) (invalid, non-positive)
- \(n = 24\): \(a = 10 - 24 + 1 = -13\) (invalid, non-positive)
- \(n = 30\): \(a = 8 - 30 + 1 = -21\) (invalid, non-positive)
- \(n = 40\): \(a = 6 - 40 + 1 = -33\) (invalid, non-positive)
- \(n = 48\): \(a = 5 - 48 + 1 = -42\) (invalid, non-positive)
- \(n = 60\): \(a = 4 - 60 + 1 = -55\) (invalid, non-positive)
- \(n = 80\): \(a = 3 - 80 + 1 = -76\) (invalid, non-positive)
- \(n = 120\): \(a = 2 - 120 + 1 = -117\) (invalid, non-positive)
- \(n = 240\): \(a = 1 - 240 + 1 = -238\) (invalid, non-positive)

The valid values of \(n\) are \(2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12\), corresponding to six sequences. Thus, the number of arithmetic sequences of consecutive odd integers that sum to 240 is:

\[
\boxed{G}
\]
