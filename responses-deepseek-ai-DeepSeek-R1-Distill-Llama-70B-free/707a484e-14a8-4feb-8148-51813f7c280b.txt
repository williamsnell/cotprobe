Okay, so I've got this NMR question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let me see what the question is asking.

The question says that 23Na has an NMR frequency of 198.52 MHz in a 750 MHz NMR spectrometer. I need to find its magnetogyric ratio. The options are from A to J, each with different values in terms of 10^7 T-1 s-1.

Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the frequency of a nucleus is related to the magnetogyric ratio (gamma), the magnetic field strength (B0), and the gyromagnetic ratio. Wait, sometimes I get confused between gyromagnetic and magnetogyric. Oh wait, I think they're the same thing. Or wait, maybe not. Wait, no, I think the magnetogyric ratio is the same as the gyromagnetic ratio. Or is it something different? Hmm, maybe I should clarify that first.

Wait, I think the magnetogyric ratio is gamma (γ), which is a characteristic of the nucleus. The formula I remember is the Larmor equation: frequency (ν) equals gamma times the magnetic field (B0) divided by 2π. Or wait, does it include the magnetic field's relation in some way? Let me think.

Wait, the Larmor frequency is given by ω = γ B0, where ω is the angular frequency. But since frequency ν is ω/(2π), so ν = (γ B0) / (2π). Or wait, sometimes the formula is written as ν = (γ/2π) * B0. Or maybe I'm mixing up some terms here.

Wait, the spectrometer's operating frequency is given as 750 MHz. I think that's the proton frequency. Because in NMR, the spectrometer is usually set up for the proton frequency. So for protons, the resonance frequency is 750 MHz. So from that, I can find the magnetic field strength B0.

Wait, right, because for protons, the magnetogyric ratio (gamma for proton) is known. I think the proton's gamma is approximately 267.5 x 10^7 T^-1 s^-1. Wait, no, wait, I might be getting that wrong. Let me think again. Oh wait, the gyromagnetic ratio for proton is about 42.58 MHz/T. So gamma is 2π times that frequency per tesla.

Wait, because the gyromagnetic ratio is ν = gamma * B0. So gamma = ν / B0. Wait, but that's when B0 is in tesla. Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the formula: gamma = (2π ν) / B0. Because the Larmor frequency ω is gamma*B0, and omega is 2π ν. So gamma = ω / B0 = (2π ν) / B0.

Wait, but in the spectrometer, the operating frequency is for the proton. So, for the proton, the equation would be ν_H = (gamma_H / 2π) * B0. Solving for B0: B0 = (2π ν_H) / gamma_H.

But wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to approach this step by step.

The spectrometer's operating frequency is 750 MHz. That's the frequency at which the instrument is tuned for proton NMR. So, using that, I can find B0, the magnetic field strength, using the proton's magnetogyric ratio.

The formula for the proton is:

ν_H = (gamma_H / 2π) * B0

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up something. Let me check: the Larmor frequency equation is ν = (gamma * B0) / (2π). So rearranged, gamma = (2π ν) / B0. But wait, that would make gamma dependent on B0, which doesn't make sense because gamma is a constant for each nucleus.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Oh wait, no, wait. The Larmor frequency is given by ν = (gamma * B0) / (2π). So gamma is a constant, and B0 is the magnetic field. So for a given B0, each nucleus resonates at a frequency determined by their gamma.

So, the spectrometer's operating frequency (750 MHz) corresponds to the proton's resonance frequency at that B0. So using that, we can compute B0.

Proton's gamma (γ_H) is known. Let me recall the value. I think the proton's gamma is approximately 267.5 x 10^7 rad·T^-1·s^-1. Wait, wait, radians are involved here. Because the Larmor equation uses angular frequency, which is in radians per second.

Wait, let me get this right. The angular frequency ω is gamma times B0. So ω = gamma * B0.

And ω is equal to 2π times the frequency ν. So, ω = 2π ν.

So putting it together:

2π ν = gamma * B0

=> B0 = (2π ν) / gamma

But wait, that's if we're solving for B0 given the frequency and gamma. But in this case, for the proton, the spectrometer's frequency is 750 MHz, so that's the ν for proton. So we can find B0 using the proton's gamma.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The spectrometer is set to 750 MHz for proton NMR. So when the proton is placed in the magnet, it resonates at 750 MHz. So using the proton's gamma, I can find the B0 as follows:

ν_H = (gamma_H / 2π) * B0

So, solving for B0:

B0 = (2π ν_H) / gamma_H

Wait, but I think I have gamma_H's value in terms of MHz per Tesla. Let me recall. The proton gyromagnetic ratio is approximately 42.58 MHz/T. So gamma_H is 2π times that, but wait no. Wait, no: because ν = (gamma/2π) * B0. So gamma = (2π ν)/B0.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute B0 using the proton's ν and gamma.

Wait, if the proton's ν is 750 MHz, then:

gamma_H = (2π ν) / B0.

Wait, no, that would require knowing B0, which is what I'm trying to find.

Hmm, maybe I'm going about this the wrong way. Let me think: For a given B0, the resonance frequency of a nucleus is ν = (gamma/2π) * B0.

So for protons, ν_H = (gamma_H / 2π) * B0.

So solving for B0:

B0 = (2π ν_H) / gamma_H.

I think I'm getting stuck because I don't have the exact value of gamma_H in the correct units.

Alternatively, I remember that the proton's gamma is about 267.5 x 10^7 rad·T^-1·s^-1. Because 1 radian per second is 1 Hz, so 267.5e7 rad/(T·s) would be 267.5e7 Hz/T, which would be 26.75 GHz/T. Wait, but that can't be right because I know that for a 1 T magnet, protons resonate at about 42.58 MHz.

Wait, so let me correct that. The proton's gamma is 42.58 MHz/T. So that's 42.58e6 Hz/T. Since 1 Hz is 1 rad/s, then gamma in rad/(T·s) is 2π * 42.58e6 rad/(T·s).

So gamma_H = 2π * 42.58e6 ≈ 6.2832 * 42.58e6 ≈ 267.5e6 rad/(T·s), which is 267.5 x 10^6 rad/(T·s), or 2.675 x 10^8 rad/(T·s). Wait, but wait, 42.58e6 Hz is the same as 42.58e6 rad/s per Tesla. So gamma is 42.58e6 * 2π rad/(T·s).

Wait, but this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should just proceed step by step.

So, the spectrometer's frequency for proton is 750 MHz, which is the resonance frequency. So for proton:

ν_H = (gamma_H / 2π) * B0.

We can solve B0 as:

B0 = (2π ν_H) / gamma_H.

But I think I need to compute B0 using the proton's gamma. Let's plug in the numbers.

gamma_H (in rad/T/s) = 2π * 42.58e6 Hz/T.

So gamma_H = 2 * 3.1416 * 42.58e6 ≈ 6.2832 * 42.58e6 ≈ 267.5e6 rad/(T·s). So 267.5e6 is 2.675e8 rad/(T·s).

But maybe I can compute B0 without getting into radians. Let me see: since ν = (gamma / 2π) * B0, then gamma = (2π ν) / B0. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can just compute B0 using the known formula for the relation between the spectrometer's frequency and the nucleus' gamma.

Wait, let me think differently. The resonance frequency for a nucleus is given by:

ν = (gamma / (2π)) * B0.

So, for the proton, ν_H = (gamma_H / (2π)) * B0.

So, B0 = (2π * ν_H) / gamma_H.

Now, we can compute B0 using this, but I need to have consistent units.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute B0 using the known relation for proton NMR. I know that for a 1 T magnet, the proton resonates at about 42.58 MHz. So, if the spectrometer is operating at 750 MHz, then B0 must be higher than 1 T.

Wait, because 750 MHz is much higher than 42.58 MHz. So, B0 = (750 MHz) / (42.58 MHz/T) ) * T.

Wait, no, wait. The frequency scales with B0. So, ν = gamma/(2π) * B0. So B0 is proportional to ν. So if ν increases, B0 increases proportionally.

So, for proton:

At B0 = 1 T, ν_H = 42.58 MHz.

At B0 = B, ν_H = 750 MHz.

So, B = (750 MHz) / (42.58 MHz/T) ) = (750 / 42.58) T ≈ 17.62 T.

Wait, that seems high, but I think that's correct for a 750 MHz spectrometer, which is a very high-field magnet. So B0 is approximately 17.62 Tesla.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is correct. Let me double-check. 750 MHz divided by 42.58 MHz/T: 750 / 42.58 ≈ 17.62. Yes, that makes sense. So B0 is about 17.62 T.

Now, the question is about 23Na. Its frequency is given as 198.52 MHz in the same spectrometer (so same B0). So, using the same B0, I can find the gamma for 23Na.

The formula again is:

ν_Na = (gamma_Na / (2π)) * B0.

We can solve for gamma_Na as:

gamma_Na = (2π * ν_Na) / B0.

We have ν_Na = 198.52 MHz = 198.52e6 Hz.

B0 is 17.62 T.

So, gamma_Na = (2 * π * 198.52e6 Hz) / 17.62 T.

Wait, let me compute that.

First, compute 2π * 198.52e6:

2 * 3.1416 ≈ 6.2832.

6.2832 * 198.52e6 ≈ let's compute 198.52e6 * 6.2832.

198.52e6 = 1.9852e8.

1.9852e8 * 6.2832 ≈ approx 1.9852e8 * 6 = 1.191e9, plus 1.9852e8 * 0.2832 ≈ approx 0.562e9, so total approx 1.191e9 + 0.562e9 = 1.753e9 rad/s.

Wait, but more accurately, let's compute 198.52e6 * 6.2832.

198.52e6 = 198,520,000.

198,520,000 * 6.2832 = ?

Let me compute 198,520,000 * 6 = 1,191,120,000.

198,520,000 * 0.2832 ≈ 198,520,000 * 0.28 = 55,585,600 and 198,520,000 * 0.0032= approx 634,624. So total 55,585,600 + 634,624 ≈ 56,220,224.

So total 1,191,120,000 + 56,220,224 ≈ 1,247,340,224 rad/s.

Then, gamma_Na = 1,247,340,224 rad/s / 17.62 T.

Compute that division:

1,247,340,224 / 17.62 ≈ Let's see. 17.62 * 70,000,000 = 1,233,400,000. So 70,000,000 gives 1.2334e9. The numerator is 1.2473e9. The difference is about 13.9e6.

So, 13.9e6 / 17.62 ≈ approx 0.79 million.

So, gamma_Na ≈ 70.79 million rad/(T·s).

Expressed in scientific notation, that's 7.079e7 rad/(T·s).

Wait, but wait, the options are in terms of 1e7, so 7.079e7 is 70.79e6, which is 70.79 x 10^6, but the options have F: 7.081 x 10^7, which is 70.81 x 10^6.

Hmm, that's very close to our calculated value of approximately 70.79 x 10^6. So the correct answer would be F: 7.081 x 10^7 T^-1 s^-1.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, let me compute 2πν_Na:

ν_Na = 198.52e6 Hz.

2π = approx 6.283185307.

So 198.52e6 * 6.283185307 = ?

Let me compute 198,520,000 * 6.283185307.

Breaking it down:

198,520,000 * 6 = 1,191,120,000.

198,520,000 * 0.283185307 ≈ Let's compute 0.2 * 198,520,000 = 39,704,000.

0.08 * 198,520,000 = approx 15,881,600.

0.003185307 * 198,520,000 ≈ approx 632,  let me compute 198,520,000 * 0.003 = 595,560.

So adding those: 39,704,000 + 15,881,600 = 55,585,600 + 595,560 = 56,181,160.

Wait, but that's 0.283185307, so the total would be 39,704,000 + 15,881,600 + 632, 000 (approx) = 56,217,600.

So 1,191,120,000 + 56,217,600 = 1,247,337,600 rad/s.

Now, B0 is 17.62 T.

So gamma_Na = 1,247,337,600 / 17.62 = ?

Let me compute this division.

17.62 * 70,000,000 = 1,233,400,000.

Subtract that from 1,247,337,600: 1,247,337,600 - 1,233,400,000 = 13,937,600.

Now, 13,937,600 / 17.62 ≈ Let's compute 17.62 * 790,000 = ?

17.62 * 700,000 = 12,334,000.

17.62 * 90,000 = approx 1,585,800.

So 12,334,000 + 1,585,800 = 13,919,800. That's very close to 13,937,600.

So 790,000 would give 13,919,800, which is 13,937,600 - 13,919,800 = 17,800 left.

17,800 / 17.62 ≈ 1010.

So total is 70,790,000 + 1010 ≈ 70,800, approximately.

Wait, but this is getting a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator approach.

Compute 1,247,337,600 ÷ 17.62.

Let me write this as:

1,247,337,600 ÷ 17.62 = ?

Well, 17.62 goes into 124.73376e6 how many times?

Alternatively, perhaps using exponents:

1,247,337,600 = 1.2473376e9.

17.62 = 1.762e1.

So 1.2473376e9 / 1.762e1 = (1.2473376 / 1.762) )e8.

Compute 1.2473376 ÷ 1.762.

Let me compute this division. 1.2473376 ÷ 1.762.

1.762 × 0.7 = 1.2334. Which is less than 1.2473376.

The difference is 1.2473376 - 1.2334 = 0.0139376.

Now, 0.0139376 ÷ 1.762 ≈ 0.007907.

So total is approximately 0.7 + 0.007907 = 0.707907.

So, (1.2473376 / 1.762 ) ≈ 0.7079.

Then, multiplying by 1e8 gives 7.079e7 rad/(T·s).

So gamma_Na ≈ 7.
