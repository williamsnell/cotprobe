Okay, so I've got this question about aquatic plants and how they regulate their water content. Hmm, let me think. The question states that the protoplasm of these plants is hypertonic compared to their surrounding water. So, hypertonic means their cells have a higher concentration of solutes than the water around them. 

Wait, when a cell is hypertonic, water should flow into the cell by osmosis because water moves from low solute concentration to high. But the question says the amount of water in the plant cells remains constant. So, how does that happen?

I remember that in plants, especially land plants, the cell wall plays a role in preventing the cell from bursting. But these are aquatic plants, maybe submerged in water. So, when a plant cell is in water, it tends to absorb water until the osmotic pressure is balanced. But if the cell is in fresh water, like a pond, it's hypotonic to the cell, so water would rush in. But plants don't just keep swelling forever. So there must be a mechanism to stop that.

Oh right, turgor pressure. As the cell absorbs water, the protoplast (the cell membrane and the cytoplasm) pushes against the cell wall, creating turgor pressure. This pressure resists further water entry. So when turgor pressure equals the osmotic pressure, water stops flowing in. But wait, the question says the plant's protoplasm is hypertonic, so maybe the cell is always absorbing water, but doesn't let it get too much. Or perhaps the cell has a way to regulate water influx.

Looking at the options now. The question is about what regulates the influx. So options are about different mechanisms.

Option A: Osmotic pressure regulates influx. Osmotic pressure is the driving force for water movement, so it's a factor, but does it regulate the amount? Or is it more about the balance between osmotic and turgor pressures.

Option B: Turgor pressure regulates influx. Turgor pressure is the pressure exerted by the cell contents against the cell wall. When turgor increases, it can counteract the osmotic pressure, thereby reducing the net inflow of water. So as water enters, turgor increases until equilibrium, preventing more water from coming in. So turgor pressure could be the regulator here.

Option C: Aquaporins. These are proteins that allow water to flow through the membrane. If they regulate the influx, then the plant could control how much water enters by opening or closing these channels. But I'm not sure if this is how it's primarily regulated in this case. Aquaporins can adjust water permeability, but is that the main mechanism here?

Option D: Active transport. That's for moving ions or solutes against a concentration gradient, using energy. Water moves passively through osmosis, so active transport isn't directly regulating water influx.

Option E: Plasmolysis. That's when the cell shrinks due to water loss, which would happen if the solution is hypertonic. But in this case, the surrounding water is hypotonic, so plasmolysis isn't the issue here.

Option F: Capillary action. That's about water moving through narrow spaces, like in the xylem. Not directly related to the cell's regulation of water influx.

Option G: Diffusion of solutes. Solutes don't directly regulate water influx, though their concentration affects osmotic pressure. The movement of solutes might influence water, but the regulation is more about pressure.

Option H: Guard cells. They regulate gas exchange in stomata, but not the water influx into the cells themselves in aquatic plants. So probably not relevant here.

Option I: Contractile vacuoles. These are found in some protists and plants to expel excess water. If the cell is taking in too much water, the vacuole contracts to pump it out. But wait, in most plants, especially higher plants, contractile vacuoles aren't a major feature. They have central vacuoles, but those are more for storage. However, aquatic plants might have mechanisms to expel excess water. Alternatively, maybe this is a possibility.

Option J: Cellulose wall. The cell wall provides structural support and prevents bursting, but does it regulate the amount of water? It provides the counter-pressure via turgor, but perhaps the wall itself isn't the regulator.

So putting it together, when the cell is in water, it starts to swell. Water enters until the turgor pressure balances the osmotic pressure. So the regulation is because turgor pressure resists further water intake. So the mechanism is turgor pressure regulating the influx. So option B.

Alternatively, could it be aquaporins? If the plant can control the number of aquaporins open, it could regulate how much water comes in. But I think in most plant cells under normal conditions, the primary regulation is through the balance of pressures, not by aquaporins. Aquaporins might adjust the rate, but the main regulation is the pressure equilibrium.

So the correct answer should be B: Turgor pressure regulates the influx of water.

In aquatic plants with hypertonic protoplasm, water tends to flow into the cell due to osmosis. However, the amount of water in the plant cells remains constant because of a regulatory mechanism. As water enters the cell, the protoplast (cell membrane and cytoplasm) pushes against the cell wall, generating turgor pressure. This turgor pressure opposes the osmotic pressure, preventing further water inflow once equilibrium is reached. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Osmotic pressure** is the driving force for water movement but does not regulate the influx directly.  
- **B: Turgor pressure** is the correct mechanism, as it counteracts osmotic pressure and prevents excessive water entry.  
- **C: Aquaporins** can influence water permeability but are not the primary regulatory mechanism in this context.  
- **D: Active transport** is unrelated, as water movement is passive.  
- **E: Plasmolysis** occurs in hypertonic environments, not relevant here.  
- **F: Capillary action** pertains to water movement in narrow spaces, not cellular regulation.  
- **G: Diffusion of solutes** affects osmotic pressure but does not regulate water influx directly.  
- **H: Guard cells** regulate gas exchange, not water influx in aquatic plants.  
- **I: Contractile vacuoles** expel water in some organisms but are not the primary mechanism in higher plants.  
- **J: Cellulose wall** provides structural support but does not actively regulate water influx.  

The primary regulatory mechanism is turgor pressure, which balances osmotic pressure and maintains constant water levels in the cell.
