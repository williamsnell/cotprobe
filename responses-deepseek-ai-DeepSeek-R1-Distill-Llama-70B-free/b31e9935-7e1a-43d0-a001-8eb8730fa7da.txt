Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about making lithopone white paint. The question gives me a chemical equation: BaS + ZnSO4 → BaSO4 + ZnS. And I need to find the weight ratio of the products, BaSO4 and ZnS. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with ratios, especially in chemical reactions, stoichiometry is key here.

Let me start by writing down the balanced equation. Wait, the equation they provided is already balanced, right? Let me check. On the left, Ba has one, S one, Zn one, S one, O four. On the right, BaSO4 has Ba one, S one, O four. ZnS has Zn one and S one. So each side has one Ba, one S in BaSO4, one Zn, and one S in ZnS. So yeah, the equation is already balanced as 1:1.

So the molar ratio of BaSO4 to ZnS is 1:1. But the question asks for the weight ratio, not molar. So I need to find the molar masses of both compounds to calculate their weights.

Let me calculate each molar mass. Starting with BaSO4. Barium (Ba) has an atomic weight of about 137.33. Sulfur (S) is 32.07, and Oxygen (O) is 16.00. BaSO4 has Ba + S + 4*O. So that's 137.33 + 32.07 + (4*16.00). Let's compute that: 137.33 +32.07 is 169.4, and 4*16 is 64. So 169.4 +64 = 233.4 g/mol. 

Next, ZnS. Zinc (Zn) is around 65.38, and Sulfur is 32.07. So 65.38 +32.07 equals 97.45 g/mol.

Wait, but the molar ratio is 1:1, so for each mole of BaSO4, there's a mole of ZnS. So the weight would be their respective molar masses. So the ratio by weight is 233.4 : 97.45. 

Hmm, let me simplify that. Let's divide both numbers by 97.45 to see the ratio. Wait, actually, 233.4 divided by 97.45 is approximately 2.394, which is roughly 2.4. So the ratio is about 2.4:1, or 233:97 when considering exact molar masses.

Looking at the options, option D is 233:97 or 2.4:1. Option E is the reverse. So the correct answer should be D. 

Wait, just making sure. The question asks for BaSO4 to ZnS. Oh yeah, I did that. So BaSO4 is heavier, so the ratio is higher for BaSO4. So D is correct.

To determine the weight ratio of BaSO₄ to ZnS in the products, we start with the balanced chemical equation:

\[
\text{BaS} + \text{ZnSO}_4 \rightarrow \text{BaSO}_4 + \text{ZnS}
\]

From the equation, the molar ratio of BaSO₄ to ZnS is 1:1. However, the question asks for the weight ratio, so we calculate the molar masses of the two compounds:

1. **Molar mass of BaSO₄**:
   - Ba: 137.33 g/mol
   - S: 32.07 g/mol
   - O: 16.00 g/mol × 4 = 64.00 g/mol  
   Total: \( 137.33 + 32.07 + 64.00 = 233.40 \, \text{g/mol} \)

2. **Molar mass of ZnS**:
   - Zn: 65.38 g/mol
   - S: 32.07 g/mol  
   Total: \( 65.38 + 32.07 = 97.45 \, \text{g/mol} \)

Since the molar ratio is 1:1, the weight ratio is the ratio of their molar masses:

\[
\text{Weight ratio of BaSO}_4 : \text{ZnS} = 233.40 : 97.45
\]

Simplifying this ratio:

\[
233.40 : 97.45 \approx 2.4 : 1
\]

Thus, the weight ratio of BaSO₄ to ZnS is approximately \( 2.4 : 1 \), or equivalently \( 233 : 97 \). Comparing this to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**D: 233 : 97 or 2.4 : 1**
