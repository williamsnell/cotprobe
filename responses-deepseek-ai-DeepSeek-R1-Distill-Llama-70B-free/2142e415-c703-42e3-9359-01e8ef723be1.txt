Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to find the average energy density of a plane wave traveling in free space. The Poynting vector is given as 5 watts per square meter. Hmm, I remember that the Poynting vector relates to the power per unit area, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details.

Wait, the Poynting vector S is the instantaneous power per unit area. But we're talking about the average here. Oh right, the average Poynting vector is related to the intensity of the wave. So intensity I is the same as the average Poynting vector S_avg. So in this case, S_avg would be 5 W/m².

Now, the question is about energy density. Energy density u is the energy per unit volume. I recall that for electromagnetic waves, the energy density is related to the electric and magnetic fields. The formula is u = (ε₀ E²)/2 + (B²)/(2μ₀). But I'm not sure if I can use that directly here.

Wait, maybe there's another approach. I think there's a relationship between the intensity of an electromagnetic wave and its energy density. Oh right, the intensity I is equal to c times the energy density u, where c is the speed of light in vacuum. So I = c * u. That makes sense because intensity is power per area, and power is energy per time. So u would be I divided by c.

So if I have I = 5 W/m², then u = I / c. The speed of light c is approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s. Let me compute that. u = 5 / (3e8) m²·W/(m²·m/s) → Wait, no, let me think about the units. Watt is Joule per second, so I is W/m² = J/(s·m²). So u is in J/m³.

So u = I / c. That gives u = 5 / (3e8) J/m³. Wait, that's not matching any of the options. Oh, wait the options are in ergs, not Joules. Oh right, 1 J = 10^7 erg. So I need to convert the units.

Let me compute u in erg/m³. So 5 / (3e8) J/m³ = 5e7 erg / (3e8 m³) ) → Wait, 1 J = 1e7 erg, so 5 J is 5e7 erg. Oh wait, 5 divided by 3e8 J/m³ is equal to (5 / 3e8) * 1e7 erg/m³. Let me calculate that.

(5 / 3e8) * 1e7 = (5 * 1e7) / (3e8) = (5e7) / (3e8) = 5/(3e1) ) = 5/30 = 1/6 erg/cm³? Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check the math.

Wait, 5 / (3e8) J/m³ → to convert J to erg, multiply by 1e7. So 5 / (3e8) * 1e7 = (5 * 1e7) / (3e8) ) → 5e7 / 3e8 = (5/3) * (1e7 / 1e8) ) = (5/3) * (1/10) ) = 5/(30) ) = 1/6 erg/m³. Oh wait, so u is 1/6 erg/m³.

Looking at the options, option I is (1/6) erg/meter^3. So I think the correct answer is I.

Wait, but wait a second. I think I might have made a mistake. Let me go through it again.

I is 5 W/m² = 5 J/(s·m²). Then u = I / c. c is 3e8 m/s. So u = (5 J/(s·m²)) ) / (3e8 m/s) ) → The J/(s·m²) divided by m/s is J/(m³·s) * s → J/m³. So yes, correct.

So 5/(3e8) J/m³. Convert J to erg: 1e7 erg = 1 J. So 5/(3e8) J/m³ = 5e7 erg/(3e8 m³) ) → (5e7)/(3e8) = 5/(3*10) ) = 5/30 = 1/6 erg/m³. So yes, option I is correct.

Alternatively, another formula I recall is that the energy density u is equal to (1/2) ε₀ E², but that's the electric part. And the magnetic part is (1/2) B²/μ₀. But for a plane wave in free space, E and B are related by E = cB. So substituting, u would be (ε₀ E²)/2 + (E²/(c² μ₀ )) /2. But since c² = 1/(ε₀ μ₀), so 1/(c² μ₀ ) = ε₀ μ₀ / (μ₀ ) ) → Wait, maybe better to just use u = ε₀ E² / (2) → but perhaps it's easier to stick with the intensity approach.

Wait, another way: The average intensity is I = (1/2) c ε₀ E². So from this, E² = 2I/(c ε₀ ). Then the energy density u is (1/2) ε₀ E² + (1/2μ₀) B². But since E = c B, so B = E/c. Substituting into u, it becomes (1/2 ε₀ E²) + (1/(2 μ₀ )) (E² /c² ). But μ₀ = (1/(c² ε₀ )) ), so 1/(μ₀ c² ) = ε₀. So u = (1/2 ε₀ E²) + (1/2 ε₀ E² ) → u = ε₀ E².

Wait, but from I = (1/2) c ε₀ E² → solving for E² gives E² = 2I/(c ε₀ ). Then u = ε₀ * (2I/(c ε₀ )) ) → u = 2I/(c). Wait, that can't be right because earlier I had u = I/c. Confusion here. Hmm.

Wait I think I messed up. Let me go slowly.

I = average intensity = (1/2) c ε₀ E². So E² = 2I/(c ε₀ ). Now, the energy density is the sum of electric and magnetic contributions:

u = (1/2) ε₀ E² + (1/(2 μ₀ )) B².

But since E = c B → B = E/c.

Substitute B into u: u = (1/2) ε₀ E² + (1/(2 μ₀ )) (E² / c² )

Factor out (1/2) E²:

u = (E² / 2) [ ε₀ + 1/(μ₀ c² ) ].

But μ₀ c² = 1/(ε₀ ), so 1/(μ₀ c² ) = ε₀.

Thus, u = (E² / 2) [ ε₀ + ε₀ ] = (E² / 2)(2 ε₀ ) = ε₀ E².

But from I, E² = 2I/(c ε₀ ). Substitute back:

u = ε₀ * (2 I) / (c ε₀ ) ) → u = 2 I/(c).

Wait, but earlier I thought u was I/c. So which is correct? Hmm.

Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake. Because the intensity I is the average power per unit area, and it's also equal to the energy density multiplied by the speed of light. So I = u * c. Therefore, u = I / c.

But according to this other approach, u = 2 I / c. There's a discrepancy here. So I must be making a mistake.

Wait, let's double-check the formula. I think the correct relation is I = u c. So u = I / c.

But when I derived from the fields, I got u = 2I/c. So which is right? Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the field derivation.

Wait, another approach: The energy density is the sum of the electric and magnetic contributions. For a plane wave, these are equal, so u = u_E + u_B = 2 u_E.

But I also know that the intensity is I = u c. So if u = 2 u_E, then u_E = (1/2) ε₀ E². So u = 2*(1/2) ε₀ E² = ε₀ E². From the intensity, I = (1/2) c ε₀ E². So I = (c/2) * (u → because u= ε₀ E² ). So u = (2 I ) / c.

Wait, so that suggests u = (2 I)/c. But earlier I thought u = I / c. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Let me check a standard reference.

Wait, I think the correct relation is that the average energy density u is equal to the intensity I divided by the speed of light c. So u = I/c.

Wait, another source says that the intensity (average power per unit area) is equal to the energy density times the wave speed. So I = u c → u = I/c.

But according to the field approach, u is ε₀ E², and I is (1/2) c ε₀ E² → so I = (c/2) u → u = (2 I)/c.

Wait, now I'm confused. Which one is correct?

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the time-averaged values. For a plane wave, the time-averaged electric and magnetic energy densities are equal. So u_avg = u_E + u_B = 2 u_E.

u_E is (1/2) ε₀ E². So u_avg = 2*(1/2) ε₀ E²= ε₀ E².

But I_avg = (1/2) c ε₀ E². So I_avg = (c/2) (u_avg / ε₀ ) * ε₀ → I_avg = (c/2) u_avg → u_avg = (2 I_avg ) / c.

Wait, that's what I got earlier. So that suggests u_avg = 2 I_avg / c.

But in the initial approach, I thought u_avg = I_avg / c. So which one is correct?

Hmm. Another approach: Let's think about dimensional analysis. The Poynting vector S_avg has units of W/m² (J/s·m²). The energy density u has units of J/m³.

So u = S_avg * t, where t is time. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the intensity is power per area, so the product of intensity (S_avg) and the speed of light c (m/s) would give units of (J/s·m²) * (m/s) ) = J/(m²·s) * m/s → J/(m * s²) )? Hmm maybe not.

Alternatively, if u = I / c, then:

I is J/(s·m²). c is m/s. So J/(s·m²) divided by m/s → J/(s·m²) * s/m → J/(m^3). Which is correct for energy density. So u has units of J/m³, which matches.

But according to the field approach, u_avg = (2 I_avg ) / c.

Which would have units: (J/(s·m²)) * 2 / (m/s) ) → 2 J/(m^3 s) * s/m → wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me compute the units for u_avg = 2 I_avg / c.

I_avg has units W/m² = J/(s·m²). c is m/s.

So 2 I_avg / c → 2 * [J/(s·m²)] / (m/s) ) → 2 * J/(s m²) * s/m → 2 J/(m^3). That works. So units are correct for an energy density.

But if u_avg = I_avg / c, then units are (J/(s m²)) / (m/s) ) = J/(m^3), which also works. So both possibilities have correct units.

So perhaps I need to figure out which derivation is correct.

From the field approach, u_avg = ε₀ E_avg², but wait no, it's ε₀ E² because E is the peak value. Wait, no, the average energy density when E varies sinusoidally is (1/2) ε₀ E_rms² × 2 (since electric and magnetic are equal) → so u_avg = ε₀ E_rms².

Wait, but I think the time-averaged electric field squared is E_rms squared, which is E_peak squared over 2.

Wait, maybe I should use the RMS values here. Let's think again.

The instantaneous Poynting vector S is (E × H). For a plane wave, E and H are in phase, so S = E H.

The average value S_avg = (1/2) E_peak H_peak, assuming sinusoidal variation.

But H_peak = E_peak / η, where η is the impedance of free space, which is about 377 Ω.

Wait, for a plane wave in free space, E = c B, and H = B/μ₀. So H = E/(c μ₀ ). But η = sqrt(μ₀/ε₀ ) = μ₀ c. So H = E/(η).

So S_avg = (1/2) E_peak (E_peak / η ) ) → S_avg = E_peak²/(2 η ).

So E_peak = sqrt(2 η S_avg ).

The RMS electric field is E_rms = E_peak / sqrt(2).

So E_rms = sqrt(2 η S_avg ) / sqrt(2) ) → sqrt( η S_avg ).

Then, the energy density u_avg is the sum of electric and magnetic contributions.

Each is (1/2) ε₀ E_rms^2, and (1/(2 μ₀ )) B_rms^2.

But since E and B are related by E = c B → B_rms = E_rms/(c).

So the magnetic energy density is (1/(2 μ₀ )) (E_rms^2)/(c² ) → (1/(2 μ₀ c² )) E_rms^2.

But μ₀ c² = 1/(ε₀ ), so 1/(μ₀ c² ) = ε₀.

Thus, magnetic energy density is (ε₀ / 2 ) E_rms^2.

So total u_avg = (1/2 ε₀ E_rms^2 ) + (1/2 ε₀ E_rms^2 ) → ε₀ E_rms^2.

Substituting E_rms^2 from earlier: E_rms^2 = η S_avg.

So u_avg = ε₀ * η S_avg.

But η = sqrt( μ₀ / ε₀ ) → η = μ₀ c. Because c^2=1/(μ₀ ε₀ ), so μ₀ c = sqrt( μ₀^2 ε₀ ) ) → wait, perhaps better to compute η * ε₀.

η = μ₀ c → η * ε₀ = μ₀ c ε₀ = (1/(c^2 )) ) * c → 1/c.

Wait, η * ε₀ = μ₀ c * ε₀ = (μ₀ ε₀ ) c → μ₀ ε₀ is 1/c² → so (1/c² ) * c = 1/c.

So u_avg = ε₀ * η * S_avg = (1/c ) * S_avg → u_avg = S_avg / c.

Ah, so now I'm getting u_avg = S_avg / c. Which matches the initial approach. So earlier when I thought u_avg = 2 I_avg / c, that must have been a mistake.

So the correct relation is u_avg = I_avg / c.

So with I_avg = 5 W/m² = 5 J/(s·m²), the energy density u_avg is 5 / (3e8 m/s) → 5/(3e8) J/m³ → convert to ergs: 5e7 erg / 3e8 m³ → (5/3e1 ) erg/m³ → 5/30 = 1/6 erg/m³.

So option I is correct.

To determine the average energy density of a plane wave traveling in free space, we start with the given Poynting vector, which represents the average intensity \( I \) of the wave. The Poynting vector is given as \( 5 \, \text{W/m}^2 \), so \( I = 5 \, \text{W/m}^2 \).

The relationship between the average intensity \( I \) and the average energy density \( u \) is given by:

\[
I = u \cdot c
\]

where \( c \) is the speed of light in free space, approximately \( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Rearranging for \( u \), we find:

\[
u = \frac{I}{c}
\]

Substituting \( I = 5 \, \text{W/m}^2 \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \):

\[
u = \frac{5}{3 \times 10^8} \, \text{J/m}^3
\]

To convert \( u \) from joules to ergs (since \( 1 \, \text{J} = 10^7 \, \text{erg} \)):

\[
u = \frac{5 \times 10^7}{3 \times 10^8} \, \text{erg/m}^3 = \frac{5}{30} \, \text{erg/m}^3 = \frac{1}{6} \, \text{erg/m}^3
\]

Thus, the average energy density of the wave is \( \frac{1}{6} \, \text{erg/m}^3 \), which corresponds to option **I**.
