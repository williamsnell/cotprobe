Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about activation energy and the rate of a chemical reaction in response to temperature changes. Hmm, I remember from my studies that the rate of a reaction increases with temperature, but the exact relationships are a bit fuzzy. Let me think.

The question says that a 10-degree rise in temperature causes the reaction rate to double. And we're supposed to find the activation energy at two different temperatures: 27°C and 1000°C. Oh wait, wait, I think the activation energy is usually calculated using the Arrhenius equation or the Arrhenius plot method. Right, the Arrhenius equation is k = A * exp(-Ea/(RT)), where Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin.

But wait, how does the rate doubling with a 10°C increase tie into this? Oh right, I think there's an approximation method or a specific formula for this scenario. Oh yeah, the Arrhenius equation can be linearized using two different temperatures and their corresponding rates. The formula I remember is ln(k2/k1) = (Ea/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2)/(something... Wait, no, the correct form is ln(k2/k1) = (Ea/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2). Or was it (1/T2 - 1/T1)? Let me get this straight.

Wait, the Arrhenius equation in two-point form is ln(k2/k1) = (Ea/R) [ (1/T1 - 1/T2) ] when T2 > T1, because as temperature increases, the rate increases. So since k2 is twice k1, ln(2) equals (Ea/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2). Because T2 is T1 +10, right? Since it's a 10-degree increase.

Wait, no. Wait, let me clarify. The problem says a 10-degree rise causes the rate to double. So for a general case, when T increases by 10, rate becomes 2x. So for the first part, T1 is 27°C, which is 300 K (27+273). Then T2 is 37°C, which is 310 K. The rate at T2 is 2 times that at T1.

So plugging into the equation: ln(2) = (Ea/R)(1/300 - 1/310). Wait, wait, no, it should be (1/T1 - 1/T2) multiplied by Ea/R. So let's compute 1/300 minus 1/310. Let me calculate that. 1/300 is approximately 0.003333, and 1/310 is about 0.003226. Subtracting, 0.003333 - 0.003226 = 0.000107. So ln(2) is about 0.6931.

So, 0.6931 = (Ea/R) * 0.000107. I need to solve for Ea. R is the gas constant. Wait, which value? Because in some contexts, R is 8.314 J/mol·K, but since the answer options are in kcal/mol, I should probably use R in cal units. Oh, right, R is approximately 1.987 cal/(mol·K).

So, rearranging the equation: Ea = (0.6931 * R) / (1/300 - 1/310). Let me compute the denominator first. 0.000107 as I found earlier. So 0.6931 * 1.987 = approximately 1.377. Then divide by 0.000107.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.6931 multiplied by 1.987. Let me compute: 0.6931 * 2 is about 1.3862, but since it's 1.987, it's a bit less. Let's say approximately 1.377. Then, 1.377 divided by 0.000107. Let's compute that.

1.377 / 0.000107. Hmm, 0.0001 is 1e-4, so 1.377e4 is 13770. But since it's 0.000107, which is 1.07e-4, so 1.377 / 1.07e-4 = approximately 1.377 / 0.000107. Let me compute 1.377 / 0.0001 = 13770, but since it's 0.000107, it's a bit less. So 13770 * (0.0001/0.000107) = 13770 * (1/1.07) ≈ 13770 * 0.9346 ≈ around 12860. So about 12,860 cal/mol. Wait, but that's way higher than any of the options. Because the options are in the range of 10-17 kcal/mol. Oh wait, I must have messed up the calculation somewhere.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made an error in the denominator. Oh! Wait a second, perhaps I got the units wrong. Let me recheck the setup. Oh, wait, the formula is ln(k2/k1) = (Ea/R) (1/T1 - 1/T2). So, plugging in the numbers correctly.

Wait, let me compute it step by step. So, 1/300 is 0.0033333, and 1/310 is 0.0032258. The difference is 0.0001075. So, 1/T1 - 1/T2 is 0.0001075. 

Then, ln(2) is 0.693147.

So, 0.693147 = (Ea * 0.0001075) / R. Wait, no, correct equation is ln(2) = (Ea/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2). So Ea = [ln(2) * R ] / (1/T1 - 1/T2).

Wait, no. Let me write it correctly. The equation is:

ln(k2/k1) = (Ea/R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) * (1/?), no, the correct form is ln(k2/k1) = (Ea/R) [ (1/T1 - 1/T2) ]

Wait, no, wait, the correct formula is:

ln(k2/k1) = (Ea/R) [ (1/T1 - 1/T2) ] / [something? No, no, I think I'm mixing it up with the integrated form. Let me get the exact formula.

The correct two-point form of the Arrhenius equation is ln(k2/k1) = (Ea/R) [ (1/T1 - 1/T2) ].

Yes, that's correct. Because the Arrhenius equation is ln(k) = ln(A) - Ea/(R T). So, for two different temperatures and rates,

ln(k2) - ln(k1) = ( -Ea/(R T2) ) - ( - Ea/(R T1) ) )

So, ln(k2/k1) = Ea/(R) (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

Yes, so correct.

So, in our case, k2/k1 is 2, so ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.

So, 0.6931 = (Ea/(R)) * (1/300 - 1/310 )

Compute (1/300 - 1/310) = (310 - 300) / (300 * 310) ) = 10 / (93000) ) = 1/9300 ≈ 0.00010752688.

Then, 0.6931 = (Ea / R) * 0.00010752688.

Solving for Ea:

Ea = (0.6931 * R) / 0.00010752688.

Now, R is the gas constant, which in cal/(mol·K) is 1.987 cal/(mol·K).

So, substituting R:

Ea = (0.6931 * 1.987) / 0.00010752688.

Calculate numerator: 0.6931 * 1.987 ≈ let's compute:

0.6931 * 2 = 1.3862, subtract 0.6931 * 0.013 = approx 0.00901.

So, approx 1.3862 - 0.009 ≈ 1.3772.

So, numerator is about 1.3772.

Denominator is 0.00010752688.

So, 1.3772 / 0.00010752688 = let's compute this.

Let me compute 1.3772 / 0.00010752688.

Hmm, 1 / 0.0001075 is approximately 9300. So, 1.3772 * 9300 ≈ let me compute 1 *9300=9300, 0.3772 *9300≈ 3512. So total around 12812.

Wait, 9300 * 1.3772 = 9300 * 1 + 9300 * 0.3772.

9300 * 1 = 9300.

0.3772 *9300 = let's compute 0.3 *9300=2790; 0.0772 *9300= 718.  So 2790+718=3508.

So total is 9300 +3508 = 12808. So approximately 12808 cal/mol.

Wait, but wait, the options are all in the range of 10-17 kcal per mole. 12808 cal is 12.8 kcal/mol. Oh wait, because 1 kcal is 1000 cal. So 12808 cal is 12.808 kcal/mol. Which is approximately 12.8 kcal/mol.

Looking at the options, let's see. Hmm, looking at option D: 12.8 and 226. So that's one possibility.

Wait, but the question also asks for the activation energy at 1000°C. So I need to compute that as well.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no—wait, wait. No, wait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. Wait, the question is phrased as "What is the implied activation energy at 27°C? ; at 1000°C?" Oh, wait, that's confusing. Oh wait, wait, no, perhaps the question is that the 10-degree rise is applied at 27°C and at 1000°C, but that seems unlikely. Or perhaps, it's saying that the 10-degree rise causes a doubling in rate, and from that, find Ea at different temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no, the question says "a 10° rise in temperature results in a twofold response in the rate of a chemical reaction." So the activation energy is calculated assuming that any 10-degree increase causes the rate to double. So perhaps the activation energy is the same, regardless of temperature, but the question is implying that the rate doubles for a 10-degree increase, and from that, find Ea.

Wait, perhaps I should think about using the Arrhenius equation for each case, but I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, the first part was at 27°C (300 K) and 37°C (310 K), which gives an activation energy of approximately 12.8 kcal/mol. But looking at the options, option D is 12.8 and 226. So that would be the first part.

Now the second part is at 1000°C, which is 1273 K. So, to find the activation energy under the same condition—i.e., a 10-degree rise causing a doubling of the rate.

Wait, but wait, the activation energy is a property of the reaction, so it shouldn't depend on temperature. So why is the question asking for activation energy at two different temperatures? That doesn't make sense. Unless, perhaps, the way the question is phrased is implying that for each temperature, a 10-degree increase (from that point) causes a doubling. So perhaps the calculation is done at T1=27°C (300 K) and then at T1=1000°C (1273 K), each time considering a 10-degree increase.

So for the second part, T1 is 1000°C = 1273 K, T2=1010°C=1283 K.

So using the same formula:

ln(2) = (Ea/R) (1/1273 - 1/1283)

Compute 1/1273 ≈ 0.0007859, and 1/1283 ≈ 0.0007794.

So the difference is 0.0007859 - 0.0007794 = 0.0000065.

So, ln(2) = 0.6931 = (Ea * 0.0000065)/R.

Wait, no, correct equation is ln(2) = (Ea/R) * (1/1273 - 1/1283) → which is (Ea/R) * 0.0000065.

So, solving for Ea:

Ea = (0.6931 * R) / 0.0000065.

Again, R is 1.987 cal/(mol·K).

Compute numerator: 0.6931 * 1.987 ≈ 1.377 as before.

Denominator: 0.0000065 → so 1.377 / 0.0000065.

Calculate that: 1.377 / 0.0000065 = let's compute this.

0.0000065 is 6.5e-6. So 1.377 / 6.5e-6 → approximately 211,923 cal/mol → wait, that can't be right. Because 1.377 divided by 0.0000065.

Wait, 1e6 is 1,000,000. So 0.0000065 is 6.5e-6.

So 1.377 / 6.5e-6 = (1.377 / 6.5) ) * 1e6.

1.377 /6.5 = approximately 0.2116.

Multiply by 1e6: 211,600 cal/mol.

Wait, that's 211.6 kcal/mol. But that's way higher than any of the options given. The options for the second part are all around 190-250 kcal/mol. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the denominator. Let me recalculate 1/1273 -1/1283.

1/1273 = approximately 0.0007859 (since 1273 * 0.000785= approx 1).

1/1283 = 1/(1273+10) = let me compute it more accurately.

Compute 1273 * 1.007843 ≈ 1283. So 1/1283 ≈ 1/(1273*1.007843) ) ≈ (1/1273) * (1/1.007843) ≈ 0.0007859 * 0.9922 ≈ 0.0007794.

So the difference is 0.0007859 - 0.0007794 = 0.0000065.

So that's correct.

So, ln(2)=0.6931 = (Ea / R ) * 0.0000065.

So, Ea = (0.6931 * R) / 0.0000065.

R is 1.987 cal/mol·K.

So, 0.6931 * 1.987 = approx 1.377.

1.377 / 0.0000065 → 1.377 / 6.5e-6.

Wait, let me compute this as 1.377 / 0.0000065.

0.0000065 is 6.5e-6.

So 1.377 / 6.5e-6 = (1.377 / 6.5) ) * 1e6.

1.377 divided by 6.5 → 0.2116... → 0.2116 * 1e6 = 211,600 cal/mol → 211.6 kcal/mol.

But the options for the second part are in the 200-250 range, but 211.6 is close to 212, but none of the options match. Let me look at the options again.

Looking at option D: 12.8 and 226. Option H: 15.2 and 250. Option J:14.1 and 235.

Hmm, none is close to 211.6. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I need to use a different form of the equation. Another approach is to use the approximation ln(k2/k1) = (Ea/(R T1^2)) * delta T, but that's an approximation when delta T is small compared to T.

But in this case, when T is 1000°C (1273 K), a 10 K increase is small, so perhaps the approximation ln(2) ≈ (Ea/(R T^2)) * delta_T.

So, delta T is 10 K.

So, ln(2) ≈ (Ea/(R T^2)) * 10.

Then, Ea ≈ (ln(2) * R * T^2 ) / 10.

Let me compute that.

T is 1273 K.

So, T^2 = (1273)^2 = approx 1,620,000 (since 1200^2=1,440,000 and 73^2=5329; but more accurately, 1273*1273.

Let me compute 1273 * 1273:

First, 1200 * 1200 = 1,440,000.

1200 * 73 = 87,600.

73 * 1200 = another 87,600.

73 *73 = 5,329.

So, adding up: 1,440,000 + 87,600 +87,600 +5,329 = 1,440,000 + 175,200 +5,329 = 1,615,529.

So, T² = 1,615,529 K².

So, Ea ≈ (0.6931 * 1.987 * 1,615,529 ) / 10.

Compute numerator:

0.6931 * 1.987 ≈ 1.377.

1.377 * 1,615,529 ≈ let's compute 1.377 * 1.615e6.

1.377 * 1.615 = approx 2.223.

So, 2.223e6.

Divide by 10: 222,300 cal/mol → 222.3 kcal/mol.

That's about 222 kcal/mol. Hmm, but the options don't have 222. Option F is 13
