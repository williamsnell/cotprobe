Question:

A circus operates in a rural part of the county. It is the circus's practice to finish each day's entertainment by discharging a so-called aerial bomb into the sky. After exploding, the aerial bomb emits a spectacular rainbow fireworks display that is seen for miles around. One afternoon, a 10-year-old boy and a few friends went to the fairgrounds to see the circus. After paying their admission, they were about to enter the "big top" when the boy came upon an aerial bomb lying on the ground. Ignorant of what the object really was, but in an exploratory mood, the boy applied a match to the fuse of the fireworks device. It exploded and seriously injured the boy. After the accident, and before the parents of the boy had retained a lawyer, the adjuster for the circus's insurance carrier contacted the parents several times, trying to negotiate a settlement of their claim against the circus. On each occasion, the adjuster told the parents there was no need for them to hire an attorney because the applicable civil code did not provide for recovery in such a situation. The adjuster was aware that this information was blatantly false. He also warned the parents that unless they accepted his offered settlement of $5,000, they would receive nothing. For over a month, the adjuster continued to harass the parents. Outraged by the adjuster's actions, the parents sought the advice of a neighbor who recommended that they consult an attorney. The parents went ahead and retained a lawyer who subsequently negotiated a $250,000 settlement with the adjuster's insurance company for the claims relating to the boy's injury from the aerial bomb. If the parents assert a claim against the adjuster to recover damages for infliction of emotional distress, they will

Options:

A: not recover, because the adjuster's actions were part of his job duties.
B: recover, because the adjuster's actions constituted harassment.
C: not recover, because the parents took the advice of a neighbor and consulted an attorney.
D: not recover, because the parents did not suffer emotional distress that was severe.
E: not recover, because the parents eventually received a $250,000 settlement from the adjuster's insurance company.
F: recover, because the adjuster provided false information to the parents.
G: not recover, because the adjuster's actions did not directly cause the boy's injury.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about tort law, specifically dealing with intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED). Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the scenario. There's a circus that uses an aerial bomb for fireworks. One day, a 10-year-old boy finds this bomb on the ground, doesn't know what it is, lights the fuse, and it explodes, injuring him seriously.

Then, the adjuster from the circus's insurance company contacts the parents. He tries to settle the claim and tells them that they don't need a lawyer because the civil code doesn't allow recovery in this situation. But the adjuster knows this is false. He also threatens that if they don't take the $5,000 offer, they'll get nothing. He harasses them for over a month, and eventually, the parents get a lawyer who secures a $250k settlement.

Now, the parents are asserting a claim against the adjuster for infliction of emotional distress. The question is whether they can recover damages.

I remember that IIED has specific elements. The plaintiff must show that the defendant's conduct was outrageous, intentional or reckless, and caused severe emotional distress. Also, the conduct must be the cause of the distress.

Looking at the adjuster's actions: he lied to the parents about the law, told them they didn't need a lawyer, and tried to push a low settlement. He did this repeatedly over a month, which sounds harassing.

So, the elements:

1. **Outrageous Conduct**: Lying and threatening someone in a vulnerable position (after their child was injured) could be considered outrageous. The adjuster knowingly gave false info, which is pretty bad.

2. **Intent or Recklessness**: The adjuster knew the info was false, so he acted intentionally.

3. **Severe Emotional Distress**: The question is, did the parents suffer severe distress? The scenario says the parents were "outraged" by the adjuster's actions. But does that rise to the level of severe? I think severe emotional distress usually requires more than just being upset or angry. It might need psychological harm, like anxiety, depression, etc. The question doesn't specify that they had any medical issues or significant emotional harm beyond being outraged. So maybe they didn't meet this element.

But wait, the answer options might hinge more on other points.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Not recover because adjuster's actions were part of his job duties. I'm not sure if job duties would shield someone from IIED claims. If the conduct is outrageous beyond the scope, maybe not. So A might not be correct.

Option B: Recover because it's harassment. Harassment can be part of IIED, but the key is whether it's outrageous and causes severe distress. So this might depend on whether the distress was severe.

Option C: Not recover because they consulted an attorney. I don't see how consulting an attorney would bar recovery. It might mitigate damages but not prevent a claim.

Option D: Not recover because the emotional distress wasn't severe. This seems possible. If the parents only felt outrage but didn't suffer severe distress, they might not meet the standard.

Option E: Not recover because they got a settlement. But the claim here is against the adjuster, not the circus. The settlement from the insurance company might not impact the IIED claim against the adjuster.

Option F: Recover because adjuster provided false info. While lying is bad, IIED requires more than just false statements; it needs outrageous conduct causing severe distress. So F alone might not be sufficient.

Option G: Not recover because the adjuster didn't cause the injury. That's true, but IIED is about the emotional distress from the adjuster's actions, not the injury. So G doesn't seem right.

So, putting it together: The key issue is whether the parents suffered severe emotional distress. The scenario says they were "outraged," but that might not be enough. Courts typically require more than just anger or upset; they look for significant psychological harm.

Therefore, the answer would be D: not recover because the emotional distress wasn't severe enough.

The question revolves around whether the parents can recover damages for infliction of emotional distress (IIED) caused by the adjuster's actions. To succeed in an IIED claim, the parents must show that the adjuster's conduct was outrageous, intentional or reckless, and caused them severe emotional distress.

1. **Outrageous Conduct**: The adjuster knowingly provided false information, threatened the parents, and harassed them over a month, which could qualify as outrageous behavior.

2. **Intent or Recklessness**: The adjuster acted intentionally, as he was aware the information he provided was false.

3. **Severe Emotional Distress**: While the parents were "outraged," the scenario does not specify that they suffered severe emotional distress, such as psychological harm or medical issues. Courts typically require more than mere anger or upset for an IIED claim.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. Job duties do not shield someone from IIED if the conduct is outrageous.
- **B**: Incorrect. Harassment alone does not meet the severe distress requirement.
- **C**: Incorrect. Consulting an attorney does not bar recovery.
- **D**: Correct. The parents likely did not suffer severe emotional distress beyond being outraged.
- **E**: Incorrect. The settlement from the insurance company does not affect the IIED claim against the adjuster.
- **F**: Incorrect. Providing false information alone is insufficient without severe distress.
- **G**: Incorrect. The claim is about the adjuster's actions, not the injury.

The key issue is the lack of severe emotional distress, making **D** the correct answer.
