Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about symbolizing the sentence "Everybody loves Raymond, or not." Using propositional logic (PL), I need to choose the correct formula from the options given.

First, let me break down the sentence. It says, "Everybody loves Raymond, or not." That feels a bit like a tautology to me because it's stating two opposite situations. So, if I let L represent "Everybody loves Raymond," then the sentence is saying L or not L, right?

Wait, no, that's not exactly right. The sentence is "Everybody loves Raymond, or not." So it's presenting two possibilities: either everybody loves Raymond (L) or they don't (~L). So in logical terms, that would be L or ~L, which is L ∨ ~L.

But wait, I remember that in logic, L ∨ ~L is a tautology because it's always true. It's the law of excluded middle, meaning every statement is either true or false. So the formula should represent that.

Now looking at the options:

Option A: L → ~L. That would mean if everybody loves Raymond, then they don't. Which doesn't seem to fit.

Option B: ~L • L. That's the conjunction of L and ~L, which is a contradiction. So that's always false.

Option C: L ∨ ~L. That's exactly what I thought earlier, the tautology.

Option D: Just L. That doesn't capture the 'or not' part.

Option E: L ∧ L. That's just L again, same as D.

Option F: L • ~L. Same as B, a contradiction.

Option G: ~L → L. That would mean if not L then L, which is a bit confusing. It's not capturing the 'or' part.

Option H: ~L ∧ ~L. That's just saying not L and not L, which simplifies to ~L. But the sentence is about L or not L, not just not L.

Option I: ~L. Again, that's only the negation, not both possibilities.

So the correct formula should be option C: L ∨ ~L.

The sentence "Everybody loves Raymond, or not" can be symbolized in propositional logic by letting \( L \) represent "Everybody loves Raymond." The phrase "or not" indicates a disjunction between \( L \) and its negation \( \neg L \), which is expressed as \( L \lor \neg L \). This is a tautology, meaning it is always true, as it covers all possible truth values of \( L \).

Analyzing the options:

- **A: \( L \to \neg L \)**: This means "If everybody loves Raymond, then they do not," which does not match the sentence.
- **B: \( \neg L \cdot L \)**: This is a contradiction, always false, and does not represent the sentence.
- **C: \( L \lor \neg L \)**: This correctly represents "Everybody loves Raymond, or not," as it captures the disjunction between \( L \) and \( \neg L \).
- **D: \( L \)**: This only represents "Everybody loves Raymond," ignoring the "or not" part.
- **E: \( L \land L \)**: This is equivalent to \( L \), which again does not include the negation.
- **F: \( L \cdot \neg L \)**: This is the same as option B, a contradiction.
- **G: \( \neg L \to L \)**: This means "If not \( L \), then \( L \)," which does not align with the sentence.
- **H: \( \neg L \land \neg L \)**: This simplifies to \( \neg L \), which only represents the negation, not the full disjunction.
- **I: \( \neg L \)**: This only represents the negation, not the full statement.

The correct answer is **C: \( L \lor \neg L \)**, as it accurately symbolizes the given sentence.

Answer: C
