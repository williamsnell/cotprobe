Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem is about the decomposition of acetone when heated. The reaction is first-order, which I remember means the rate depends on the concentration of one reactant. The half-life is given as 81 seconds. I need to find out how long it takes for the acetone pressure to drop from 0.48 atm to 0.45 atm in a 1-liter container at 600°C.

Hmm, first-order reactions have specific formulas. Oh right, the half-life formula for a first-order reaction is t₁/₂ = ln(2) / k, where k is the rate constant. But wait, I also remember that for first-order reactions, the rate can be expressed using the natural logarithm of concentrations over time.

The formula I think I need is ln([A]₀/[A]) = kt. Since we're dealing with pressures, I can probably use the same approach with pressures instead of concentrations because, in a closed container at constant volume and temperature, pressure is directly proportional to concentration.

The initial pressure is 0.48 atm, and the final is 0.45 atm. So I can plug these into the formula. Let me write that out:

ln(P_initial / P_final) = kt.

I need to find the time t. But wait, I don't have k yet. Oh right, I can find k using the half-life formula. Since t₁/₂ is 81 seconds, and t₁/₂ = ln(2)/k, I can solve for k.

So let's compute k first.

k = ln(2) / t₁/₂ = 0.6931 / 81 ≈ let me calculate that. 0.6931 divided by 81. Let's see, 81 times 0.0085 is about 0.6885, so 0.6931-0.6885 is about 0.0046. So approximately 0.00858 per second. Wait, more accurately, 0.6931/81 = approximately 0.008555 s⁻¹.

Now that I have k, I can plug into the first formula. So ln(0.48/0.45) = kt.

Let me compute 0.48 divided by 0.45. That's 1.066666... So ln(1.066666). I remember ln(1) is 0, and ln(1.1) is about 0.0953. Let me see, 1.0667 is about 6.67% higher than 1.

Using a calculator, ln(1.0667) ≈ 0.0645. But I'm not entirely sure; maybe I should compute it more accurately. Alternatively, using a Taylor series approximation. But perhaps for the sake of time, I'll take it as approximately 0.0645.

So 0.0645 = (0.008555) * t. Solving for t gives t = 0.0645 / 0.008555 ≈ let's compute that.

0.0645 divided by 0.008555. Let me see, 0.008555 * 7.5 is approximately 0.0641625. That's close to 0.0645. So 7.5 seconds would give about 0.06416, which is a bit less than 0.0645. The actual value would be a little more than 7.5 seconds.

Wait, looking at the options, option E is 8.56 sec, and option D is 7.5. Hmm, but wait. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, when I calculated k, I did 0.6931 divided by 81. Let me compute that more accurately. 0.6931 / 81 = 0.008555679 s⁻¹.

Then, the ratio of the pressures is 0.48/0.45 = 1.0666667.

The natural log of 1.0666667 is approximately 0.0645. So ln(1.0666667) ≈ 0.0645.

So t = 0.0645 / 0.008555679 ≈ let's calculate:

0.0645 / 0.008555679.

Let me do this division step by step. 0.008555679 multiplied by 7 equals 0.059889753. That's less than 0.0645. 0.008555679 * 7.5 = 0.064164. That's very close to 0.0645. So 7.5 seconds gives 0.064164, and our target is 0.0645, which is 0.000336 higher.

How much more time is needed? Each additional second adds 0.008555679 to the left side.

So the difference is 0.0645 - 0.064164 = 0.000336.

0.000336 / 0.008555679 ≈ 0.0392. So approximately 0.0392 seconds more than 7.5. So t ≈7.5392 seconds, about 7.54 seconds.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D:7.5 sec or option E:8.56. But none of the other options are close except D and E.

Wait, but perhaps I'm making a mistake with the approach. Let me think again. The formula I'm using is correct for a first-order reaction, right? Because for a first-order reaction, ln([A]0/[A]) = kt. Yes.

So with t ≈7.54 seconds, which is approximately 7.5 seconds. So option D is 7.5, which is the closest.

Wait, but I have to make sure I didn't mix up anything. Let me recalculate the ln(1.0666667).

Using a calculator, ln(1.0666667) = approximately 0.064538. So yes, that's correct.

So t = 0.064538 / 0.008555679 ≈ let's compute this more accurately.

0.064538 ÷ 0.008555679.

Let me compute 0.008555679 * 7.5 = 0.064164.

Difference between 0.064538 and 0.064164 is 0.000374.

Each 1 second is 0.008555679.

So 0.000374 / 0.008555679 ≈ 0.0437 of a second. So t ≈7.5 + 0.0437 = 7.5437 seconds.

So approximately 7.54 seconds. So the closest option is D, 7.5 seconds.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me think about the formula again. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the half-life in terms of the remaining amount.

Wait, another approach: for first-order reactions, the time to reach a certain fraction can be found using the formula t = t₁/₂ * ln(2) / (ln([A]0/[A])).

Wait no, that's not correct. The correct formula is t = (t₁/₂) * ln([A]0/[A]) / ln(2) ).

Wait, no, I think I might be mixing it up. Let me see.

Wait, the general formula is ln([A]0/[A]) = kt.

And since t₁/₂ is the time taken for [A] to reduce to half, so:

ln(2) = k * t₁/₂ → k = ln(2)/t₁/₂.

So substituting back into the first equation:

ln([A]0/[A]) = (ln(2)/t₁/₂) * t.

So, t = (ln([A]0/[A]) * t₁/₂) ) / ln(2).

Which would be t = t₁/₂ * ln([A]0/[A]) / ln(2).

So in this case, [A]0 is 0.48 atm, [A] is 0.45 atm. So [A]0/[A] = 0.48/0.45 = 1.0666667.

So ln(1.0666667) ≈0.064538.

ln(2)=0.693147.

So t = 81 s * 0.064538 / 0.693147.

Let me compute that.

0.064538 / 0.693147 ≈ 0.0931.

Then, 81 * 0.0931 ≈ 7.54 seconds.

So same result as before, approximately 7.54 seconds.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D:7.5 sec. So I think the correct answer is D.

But wait, why is option E 8.56? Let me check if I miscalculated something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again.

Wait, the reaction is the decomposition of acetone. So the pressure might not directly equal the concentration if gases are produced. Wait, but the problem states that acetone decomposes into CO and various hydrocarbons. So let's think about the stoichiometry. For example, acetone is (CH3)2CO. When it decomposes, perhaps it's breaking down into smaller molecules, like CO and other hydrocarbons, which are gases. So if one mole of acetone decomposes into, say, one mole of CO and other products, the total moles of gas would increase.

Wait, but the problem states that the reaction is first order in acetone. So maybe the decomposition doesn't affect the order, but perhaps the pressure change due to decomposition could affect the calculation.

Wait, but in this problem, they've given the initial pressure, and the final pressure. So perhaps the pressure drop isn't just due to the decrease in acetone, but also due to the production of other gases. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, but the problem says that acetone decomposes to give CO and various hydrocarbons. So the total pressure in the container might change based on the stoichiometry of the reaction. But since the problem gives the initial and final pressures as 0.48 atm and 0.45 atm, perhaps we don't need to consider the stoichiometry because the pressure is measured directly, regardless of the cause.

Wait, but that might not be correct. Because if acetone decomposes into multiple gaseous products, the total pressure would increase, but in this problem, the pressure is dropping, which suggests that perhaps the number of moles is decreasing. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, acetone is a liquid? No, wait, at 600°C, acetone is a gas. Because its boiling point is around 56°C, so at 600°C it's definitely gaseous. So when it decomposes, it's breaking down into gaseous products. Let's say the reaction is something like:

(CH3)2CO → CO + other hydrocarbons.

But wait, without knowing the exact stoichiometry, it's hard to model. But the problem says that the reaction is first-order in acetone, so perhaps the pressure change due to decomposition isn't necessary to model because we're given the pressure directly.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the partial pressure of acetone only, and the other products contribute to the total pressure, but the problem states the pressure of acetone. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the question states: "how long would it take for the acetone pressure to drop to 0.45 atm?" So I think they're only considering the partial pressure of acetone, not the total pressure. So in that case, the approach I took earlier is correct because we're only looking at the acetone concentration (or partial pressure) as it decreases.

So the initial partial pressure of acetone is 0.48 atm, and it drops to 0.45 atm. So yes, the formula applies.

Therefore, the time is approximately 7.5 seconds, so option D is correct.

To solve the problem, we use the first-order reaction kinetics formula:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{[A]_0}{[A]}\right) = kt
\]

where:
- \([A]_0 = 0.48 \, \text{atm}\) (initial pressure of acetone),
- \([A] = 0.45 \, \text{atm}\) (final pressure of acetone),
- \(k\) is the rate constant,
- \(t\) is the time.

### Step 1: Calculate the rate constant \(k\)
The half-life of the reaction is given as \(t_{1/2} = 81 \, \text{s}\). For a first-order reaction, the rate constant is related to the half-life by:

\[
k = \frac{\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
k = \frac{0.693}{81} \approx 0.008555 \, \text{s}^{-1}
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \(t\)
Using the first-order kinetics equation:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{0.48}{0.45}\right) = kt
\]

First, calculate the ratio:

\[
\frac{0.48}{0.45} \approx 1.0667
\]

Next, calculate the natural logarithm:

\[
\ln(1.0667) \approx 0.0645
\]

Now substitute into the equation:

\[
0.0645 = (0.008555)t
\]

Solve for \(t\):

\[
t = \frac{0.0645}{0.008555} \approx 7.54 \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 3: Match the closest option
The calculated time is approximately \(7.54 \, \text{s}\), which is closest to option **D: 7.5 sec**.

### Final Answer:
D
