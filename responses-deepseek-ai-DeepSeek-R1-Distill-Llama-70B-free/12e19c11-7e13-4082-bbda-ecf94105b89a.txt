Question:

A devastating earthquake struck a foreign country. The earthquake destroyed hundreds of homes and buildings. Thousands of residents were killed, injured, and left homeless by the earthquake. The leader of the foreign country sought the assistance of the United States in providing emergency aid. The President initially wanted to send troops from a west coast military base but learned that they were out on training maneuvers. As a result, the President issued an executive order directing members of a federal agency under the supervision of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, to travel to the foreign country to engage in emergency rescue operations. This federal agency's main function is to patrol the borders to prevent illegal aliens from entering the United States. A member of this federal agency refused to comply with the executive order and assist in the relief effort. He claimed that participating in such operations in a foreign country is beyond the scope of his job responsibilities. He brought suit in federal court challenging the validity of the President's executive order. Assuming the member of the federal agency has adequate standing, the court should rule the executive order

Options:

A: valid, because as commander-in-chief, the President has unfettered authority to require federal employees to participate in an international relief effort.
B: valid, because the President can repurpose federal agencies for emergency relief efforts.
C: invalid, because the executive order is beyond the scope of presidential power absent congressional authorization.
D: invalid, because the executive order did not specify the scope of the relief operations.
E: invalid, because the executive order infringes upon the rights of federal employees.
F: invalid, because the INS does not have jurisdiction in foreign countries.
G: valid, because employees of an executive agency can be required to perform such emergency functions.
H: valid, because the president's executive power extends to directing federal agencies in times of crisis.
I: valid, because the President has the power to issue executive orders in times of emergency.
J: invalid, because the director of the INS, not the President, has the power to issue directives to federal agencies under its supervision.

Okay, so I've got this question about constitutional law, specifically dealing with presidential powers and executive orders. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is that there's a devastating earthquake in a foreign country. The leader of that country asks the U.S. for emergency aid. The President wants to send troops from a west coast base, but they're out on training. So, the President issues an executive order directing members of a federal agency under the INS to go assist in the foreign rescue operations. This agency's main job is patrolling borders to prevent illegal entry.

One of the members refuses, saying that this is beyond his job and sues, challenging the order's validity. The question is whether the court should rule the executive order valid or invalid.

I remember that the President has certain powers as both the Commander-in-Chief and the head of the executive branch. But there are limits, especially when it comes to requiring federal employees to perform tasks beyond their assigned duties, particularly outside the U.S.

So, the main issue here is whether the President can redirect federal employees from their usual duties to an international emergency without congressional authorization.

I think about the separation of powers. Congress makes the laws, the President executes them. The President's authority to issue executive orders is based on either inherent powers or statutory authority. But does that extend to repurposing federal agencies in this way?

The agency in question is under the INS, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security. Their main function is border patrol. So, the question is whether the President can order them to perform duties abroad in a rescue mission.

I recall that in times of emergency, the President might have broader powers, but there's also the issue of whether this action exceeds his authority without Congress's approval.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's valid because as commander-in-chief, the President has unfettered authority. But wait, the Commander-in-Chief role mainly applies to the military, not necessarily to all federal employees. So maybe A isn't the right choice.

Option B suggests validity because the President can repurpose federal agencies for emergencies. I'm not sure about that. Does the President have the authority to redirect agencies without Congress's say-so? I think there's a Supreme Court case, maybe Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, where the court limited the President's ability to seize property without congressional authorization. Maybe that applies here. So if the President is acting without Congress, maybe B is incorrect.

Option C says it's invalid because the order is beyond presidential power without Congress. That aligns with what I just thought. Without Congress authorizing it, the President might not have the authority to redirect agencies like that.

Option D is about the scope not being specified, but I don't think that's the main issue here. The problem is more about the authority, not the specifics of the order.

Option E claims invalidity due to infringing on employees' rights. I don't think that's the main issue. It's more about the President's power than individual rights here.

Option F says it's invalid because INS doesn't have jurisdiction abroad. That makes sense because the agency's role is domestic. If they're being sent abroad, maybe that's outside their legal authority.

Option G argues validity because executive agencies can be required to perform emergency functions. But I'm not sure if the President can unilaterally expand their duties beyond their statutory role.

Option H says it's valid because the President can direct agencies in a crisis. Again, this might depend on whether he has the inherent authority or if Congress needs to approve.

Option I is about emergency powers. While the President does have some emergency powers, they aren't unlimited. So just because it's an emergency doesn't automatically make the order valid.

Option J claims invalidity because the INS director, not the President, should issue directives. That's about the chain of command. But the President is the head of the executive branch, so he can direct agencies under him, right? So J might not be correct.

So, putting it together, the key points are:

1. Can the President redirect a federal agency beyond its statutory mandate without Congress?
2. Does the President have authority to send employees of a domestic agency abroad for rescue missions?

In Youngstown, the Supreme Court said that the President's authority is at its weakest when he acts against Congress. But here, if there's no congressional authorization, is the President overstepping?

Also, the agency's main function is border patrol, a domestic role. Deploying them internationally might exceed their authority. So maybe both the lack of congressional approval and the agency's jurisdiction are issues.

Looking at the options again, F says it's invalid because INS lacks jurisdiction abroad. That seems correct. Also, C says it's invalid because it's beyond presidential power without Congress.

But wait, does the President have the inherent authority to direct federal agencies in emergencies? Or does that require Congress?

I think that without explicit statutory authority, the President can't unilaterally expand an agency's mission, especially abroad. So the correct answer would be either C or F.

But the question is about the President's executive order being valid or not. If the agency's role is strictly domestic, then sending them abroad would be beyond their authority. So F points out that the INS doesn't have jurisdiction in foreign countries, making the order invalid.

Alternatively, C's reasoning is about the President's power without Congress. So which is the stronger argument?

In the case of the President directing agencies, I think the issue is more about the President's authority to repurpose the agency's mission without Congress, rather than the agency's jurisdiction. Because the President, as the head of the executive branch, can direct federal employees, but only within the scope of their legal duties.

So if the agency's duties are limited to domestic border patrol, then the President can't order them to go abroad because that's outside their legal authority. Therefore, F would be the reason.

Wait, but the question says the agency is under the supervision of the INS, which is a federal agency. So the President, as the head of the executive branch, can direct federal agencies, but the agency's enabling statute might limit their activities to domestic matters.

So, if the agency's statutory authority doesn't include international operations, the President can't order them to do that. Therefore, the executive order would be invalid because it's beyond the agency's scope, making F the correct answer.

Alternatively, if the President's general executive power allows him to do this in an emergency, then maybe it's valid. But I think the lack of statutory authority would make it invalid.

So, the correct answer is either C or F. But which one?

The question is about the validity of the executive order. The executive order directs the agency to perform a function outside their usual role. If the agency's duties are defined by statute as being domestic, then the President can't expand their role without Congress.

So the answer would be C: invalid because beyond presidential power without congressional authorization.

Alternatively, F is about the INS jurisdiction, but the INS itself is a domestic agency. So if the President is directing them to operate abroad, that's beyond their authority.

Wait, but the agency is under the INS's supervision. Does that mean the President can direct them anywhere? I'm not sure. It's possible that the INS's authority is limited to the U.S., so their employees can't be sent abroad by the President without Congress allowing it.

So perhaps F is the correct answer.

Alternatively, the President's order is an overreach because he's directing employees to perform duties outside their agency's mission, which would require congressional approval, making C correct.

I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think of it another way: the President's executive power includes controlling the executive branch, but each agency's functions are defined by their enabling statutes. So if the statute limits the agency to domestic operations, the President can't order them to go abroad. So the order would be invalid because it's beyond the agency's authority, which is option F.

But another angle is that the President doesn't have the inherent authority to do this without Congress, which would make option C correct.

I think the correct reasoning is that the President can't unilaterally expand the agency's mission beyond its statutory authority. So the answer would be C: invalid because beyond presidential power without congressional authorization.

But wait, in the question, the agency's main function is patrolling borders. So deploying them abroad is outside their scope. Therefore, the order is invalid because it's beyond the agency's authority, which is option F.

Hmm, but the question is about the President's power, not the agency's. So if the President directs them, but the agency's enabling act doesn't allow it, then the order is invalid as an overreach of presidential authority, making C the correct answer.

So I'm torn between C and F. Which is more accurate?

In the case of the President ordering an agency to act beyond its statutory authority, the order would be invalid because the President can't exceed the agency's powers. So the basis is the President's lack of authority without Congress, making option C correct.

Alternatively, the issue is that the INS doesn't have jurisdiction abroad, making option F correct.

I think the answer is C: invalid because the President can't do that without Congress. Because the President's power to direct federal agencies is limited by the agencies' enabling statutes. Without Congress authorizing it, he can't expand their duties.

So the correct answer is C.

The question revolves around whether the President's executive order directing a federal agency under the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to engage in international rescue operations is valid. The agency's primary function is domestic border patrol, and the President is attempting to repurpose it for an international emergency without congressional authorization.

Key considerations include:

1. **Presidential Power and Agency Authority**: The President, as head of the executive branch, has broad authority to direct federal agencies. However, this authority is limited by the agencies' enabling statutes. If the agency's statutory mandate does not include international operations, the President cannot unilaterally expand its mission without congressional approval.

2. **Scope of Agency Jurisdiction**: The agency in question is tasked with domestic border patrol, which suggests its authority is limited to U.S. territory. Deploying it abroad would likely exceed its jurisdiction, as its enabling statute does not explicitly authorize international operations.

3. **Emergency Powers**: While the President has certain emergency powers, these are not unlimited. The Supreme Court, in cases like *Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer*, has established that presidential authority is weakest when acting without congressional support. Here, the President's order appears to lack statutory or congressional backing.

4. **Standing and Validity**: The member of the federal agency has standing to challenge the order, and the court must determine whether the President's action exceeds his constitutional and statutory authority. The crux of the issue is whether the President can repurpose a federal agency for international operations without congressional authorization.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. The President's authority as Commander-in-Chief primarily applies to the military, not federal agencies with domestic mandates.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The President cannot repurpose federal agencies for emergency relief efforts without statutory authority or congressional approval.
- **Option C**: Correct. The executive order is invalid because it exceeds presidential power absent congressional authorization. The President cannot unilaterally expand the agency's mission beyond its statutory mandate.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The issue is not the specificity of the order but the lack of authority to redirect the agency internationally.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The validity of the order does not hinge on individual employee rights but on the President's authority.
- **Option F**: Plausible but secondary. While the INS lacks jurisdiction abroad, the primary issue is the President's overreach of authority without congressional approval.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Federal agencies cannot be required to perform duties beyond their statutory scope without authorization.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. Presidential authority to direct agencies in a crisis is limited by statutory constraints.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. Emergency powers do not grant the President unlimited authority to act without congressional support.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The President, as head of the executive branch, has the authority to direct federal agencies under his supervision.

### Conclusion:
The court should rule the executive order invalid because the President lacks the authority to repurpose a federal agency for international operations without congressional authorization. This aligns with the principle that presidential power is limited by statutory and constitutional constraints.
