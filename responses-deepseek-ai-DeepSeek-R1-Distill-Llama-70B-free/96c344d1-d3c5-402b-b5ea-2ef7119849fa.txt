Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about equilibrium constants and some spectroscopic stuff. But I'll try to take it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The reaction given is I2 → 2I at 1000 K and 1 atm. They provide the fundamental vibration frequency ν of I2 as 214.4 cm⁻¹, and the internuclear distance is 0.2667 nm. Also, the ground state of I is a doublet state, specifically ^2P_(3/2,1/2), with a separation of 7603 cm⁻¹. The dissociation energy of I2 is 1.542 eV. And we need to find the equilibrium constant Kp for this reaction from the given options.

Hmm, okay. I remember that calculating the equilibrium constant for a dissociation reaction like this often involves the use of the Arrhenius equation or the van 't Hoff equation. But wait, another thought: for diatomic molecules like I2, the dissociation can also be approached using the bond dissociation energy and partition functions. Oh right, the calculation might involve the vibrational and electronic partition functions, along with the dissociation energy.

Wait, but the question gives some specific data: the vibrational frequency, so perhaps we're supposed to calculate the vibrational partition function. Also, the ground state is a doublet, so electronic partition functions might come into play.

Let me think about the steps involved. I think the equilibrium constant K can be calculated using the relation involving the bond dissociation energy and the partition functions of the reactants and products. So, the general expression is K = (Q_product)/(Q_reactant) * exp(-ΔE/(RT)), or something along those lines.

Wait, more accurately, for the dissociation of I2 into 2I atoms, the equilibrium constant Kp is given by:

Kp = ( (Q_I)^2 ) / (Q_I2) * exp( -D/(RT) )

Where Q_I is the partition function for the I atom, and Q_I2 is the partition function for I2. D is the dissociation energy.

But wait, D here is the bond dissociation energy, right? So D is given as 1.542 eV. But I need to convert that into J or another unit compatible with R and T.

Wait, R is 8.314 J/mol·K, and T is 1000 K.

But first, I need to compute Q for I and I2.

Wait, let me break it down.

The partition function Q is the product of translational (Q_trans), rotational (Q_rot), vibrational (Q_vib), and electronic (Q_elec) partition functions.

So, for I2, Q_I2 = Q_trans * Q_rot * Q_vib * Q_elec.

For I atoms (I), since they're monatomic, their Q_I would be Q_trans * Q_elec (since no rotation or vibration for atoms).

So, Kp = [ (Q_I)^2 ] / Q_I2.

But let me think again. The reaction is I2 → 2I, so the equilibrium expression is Kp = (P_I)^2 / P_I2. Assuming ideal gases, this translates to ( (n_I)^2 / (n_I2) ) * (RT/V)^{-2} / (RT/V)^{-1} }, but maybe it's easier to think in terms of the partition functions.

Wait, using statistical mechanics, for each substance, the pressure is related to the partition function. So for ideal gases, P = (k_B T) / (λ³) * Q_int, where λ is the thermal wavelength and Q_int is the internal partition function (rot, vib, elec). But perhaps I should recall the Sackur-Tetrode equation for translational partition function.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the relation for the equilibrium constant in terms of the partition functions. The formula is K = ( (Q_product)^ν ) / (Q_reactant)^ν ) * exp( -ΔE/(RT) ), where ν are the stoichiometric coefficients.

Wait, more accurately, the equilibrium constant is given by K = ( (Q_I)^2 ) / Q_I2 ) * exp( -D/(R T) )

Because the reaction is I2 → 2I, so the activation energy is the dissociation energy. But I'm a bit confused about whether to use D as the energy per mole or per molecule.

Wait, D is given as 1.542 eV per molecule, I think. Because dissociation energy is usually per molecule. So I need to convert that into J per mole.

Wait, 1 eV is 1.60218e-19 J. So 1.542 eV = 1.542 * 1.60218e-19 J = approximately 2.47e-19 J per molecule.

But since we're dealing with moles, we have to multiply by Avogadro's number. So D per mole is 2.47e-19 J/molecule * 6.022e23 molecules/mol ≈ 1.487e5 J/mol.

Wait, but wait, 1.542 eV is for one mole? Or per molecule? Hmm, in the problem statement, it says the dissociation energy is 1.542 eV. Typically, dissociation energy can be expressed per mole or per molecule, but in this context, I think it's per molecule. So for per mole, we multiply by Avogadro's number.

So D = 1.542 eV * (1.602e-19 J/eV) * (6.022e23 mol⁻¹) = let's compute that.

1.542 * 1.602e-19 = approx 2.470e-19 J/molecule.

Multiply by 6.022e23: 2.47e-19 * 6.022e23 = approx 1.487e5 J/mol. So D = 148,700 J/mol.

But wait, R is 8.314 J/mol·K, so when calculating D/(R T), T is 1000 K.

So D/(R T) = 148700 / (8.314 * 1000) = 148700 / 8314 ≈ 17.89.

Wait, but let me make sure about the sign. The exponential term is exp(-D/(RT)), so it would be exp(-17.89), which is a very small number, around 1.7e-8 or so. But let's compute it accurately.

But before that, let's make sure I'm on the right track with the partition functions.

For I2, the internal partition function is Q_I2 = Q_vib * Q_rot * Q_elec.

Wait, but wait, for diatomic molecules, the electronic partition function is usually considered as well. However, if the molecule is in its ground electronic state, and there are no low-lying excited states, Q_elec can be approximated as 1. But in this case, the problem gives the ground state as a doublet, but I think that refers to the iodine atom, not the molecule. Wait, no, the ground state of I is a doublet. So for the molecule I2, perhaps its electronic partition function is different.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each component.

First, the translational partition function for each species. But since the reaction is in the gas phase, the translational partition functions would contribute, but in the ratio, perhaps they will cancel out. Let me see.

Wait, the equilibrium constant Kp is given by (P_I)^2 / P_I2.

In terms of the ideal gas law, P = nRT/V, but when considering partition functions, the pressure of each species is proportional to their partition functions. So for ideal gases, the partial pressure is P = (k_B T) / (h³) * (2 π m k_B T)^(3/2) ) * Q_int. Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, the expression for Kp can be written as:

Kp = ( (Q_I^trans * Q_I^elec )^2 ) / ( Q_I2^trans * Q_I2^rot * Q_I2^vib * Q_I2^elec ) ) * exp( -D/(RT) )

Wait, but the translational partition functions for I and I2 would differ because their molecular masses are different.

Wait, the translational partition function is given by Q_trans = (V/(λ³)) where λ is the thermal wavelength, λ = h / sqrt(2 π m k_B T). So for each species, their λ depends on their mass.

So for I, m_I is the mass of an iodine atom, and for I2, m_I2 = 2 m_I.

So Q_trans for I2 is (V) / ( (h / sqrt(2 π m_I2 k_B T))³ ) ) = (V (2 π m_I2 k_B T)^(3/2) ) / h³ )

Similarly, Q_trans for I is (V (2 π m_I k_B T)^(3/2) ) / h³ )

So when we take the ratio (Q_I^trans)^2 / Q_I2^trans, that would be:

[ (V (2 π m_I k_B T)^(3/2) / h³ )^2 ] / [ V (2 π m_I2 k_B T)^(3/2) / h³ ) ]

Simplify this:

= [ V² (2 π m_I k_B T)^(3) / h^6 ) ] / [ V (2 π (2 m_I) k_B T)^(3/2) / h³ ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= V (2 π m_I k_B T)^(3) / [ h^6 ] * [ h³ / (2 π (2 m_I) k_B T)^(3/2) ) V ] )

Wait, maybe it's easier to factor it:

= [ (V/(h³)) (2 π m_I k_B T)^(3/2) ) ]² / [ (V/(h³)) (2 π (2 m_I) k_B T)^(3/2) ) ]

= [ (2 π m_I k_B T)^(3) V² / h^6 ) ] / [ (2 π (2 m_I) k_B T)^(3/2) V / h³ ) ]

= [ (2 π m_I k_B T)^(3) V² ) / h^6 ) ] * [ h³ ) / ( (2 π (2 m_I) k_B T)^(3/2) V ) ) ]

Simplify:

= V (2 π m_I k_B T)^(3) * h^3 ) / ( h^6 (2 π (2 m_I) k_B T)^(3/2) ) )

= V (2 π m_I k_B T)^(3 - 3/2) ) * (1/h³) ) * (1/(2 π (2 m_I) k_B T)^(3/2) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the ratio in terms of mass.

m_I2 = 2 m_I.

So, let me compute (Q_I^trans)^2 / Q_I2^trans.

Let me write Q_trans as (V/(λ³)).

λ for I: λ_I = h / sqrt(2 π m_I k_B T )

λ for I2: λ_I2 = h / sqrt(2 π (2 m_I) k_B T ) = h / sqrt(2 * 2 π m_I k_B T ) = λ_I / sqrt(2) ?

Wait, sqrt(2 π (2 m) k T) = sqrt(2) * sqrt(2 π m k T). So sqrt(2 π (2 m) k T) = sqrt(2) * sqrt(2 π m k T).

Thus, λ_I2 = h / ( sqrt(2 π (2 m_I) k_B T) ) = h / [ sqrt(2) * sqrt(2 π m_I k_B T) ) ] = (1/sqrt(2)) * (h / sqrt(2 π m_I k_B T)) ) = λ_I / sqrt(2).

Thus, λ_I2 = λ_I / sqrt(2).

Now, Q_I^trans = V / (λ_I)^3.

Similarly, Q_I2^trans = V / (λ_I2)^3 = V / [ (λ_I / sqrt(2) )^3 ] = V * (sqrt(2))^3 / λ_I^3 = V * 2^(3/2) / λ_I^3.

So (Q_I^trans)^2 = (V^2) / (λ_I^6 )

And Q_I2^trans = V * 2^(3/2) / λ_I^3.

So (Q_I^trans)^2 / Q_I2^trans = (V^2 / λ_I^6 ) / ( V * 2^(3/2) / λ_I^3 ) ) = (V^2 / λ_I^6 ) * (λ_I^3 ) / ( V * 2^(3/2) ) )

= V / ( λ_I^3 * 2^(3/2) )

Hmm, but what is λ_I? It's h / sqrt(2 π m_I k_B T). So λ_I^3 is (h^3) / ( (2 π m_I k_B T)^(3/2) ) )

So substituting:

V / ( (h^3 / (2 π m_I k_B T)^(3/2) ) ) * 2^(3/2) )

= V (2 π m_I k_B T)^(3/2) ) / h^3 ) * 1/(2^(3/2)) )

= V (2 π m_I k_B T)^(3/2) ) / ( h^3 * 2^(3/2) ) )

Simplify 2^(3/2) as 2 * sqrt(2).

So denominator becomes h^3 * 2^(3/2) = h^3 * 2 * sqrt(2).

So the ratio becomes V (2 π m_I k_B T)^(3/2) ) / ( h^3 * 2^(3/2) ) )

Hmm, but I'm not sure if I'm getting anywhere with this. Maybe I should instead consider the ratio of the translational partition functions as (m_I / m_I2)^(3/2) times some factors.

Wait, another approach: for a diatomic molecule, the translational partition function is similar to that of a monatomic gas, but with mass m = 2m_I. So the ratio (Q_I^trans)^2 / Q_I2^trans would be:

[ (V (2 π m_I k_B T)^(3/2) / h^3 ) ]^2 / [ V (2 π (2 m_I) k_B T)^(3/2) / h^3 ) ]

= [ V² (2 π m_I k_B T)^3 / h^6 ] / [ V (2 π 2 m_I k_B T)^(3/2) / h^3 ]

= [ V (2 π m_I k_B T)^(3) * h^3 ] / [ (2 π 2 m_I k_B T)^(3/2) * h^6 ) ]

Wait, perhaps it's better to write this ratio in terms of mass.

Let me denote m = m_I, so m_I2 = 2m.

So the ratio becomes:

[ (V/(λ_I^3))² ] / ( V/(λ_I2^3) ) )

= [ V² / λ_I^6 ] * [ λ_I2^3 / V ]

= V λ_I2^3 / λ_I^6.

But λ_I2 = λ_I / sqrt(2), so λ_I2^3 = λ_I^3 / (2^(3/2)).

Substituting:

V * (λ_I^3 / 2^(3/2)) ) / λ_I^6 = V / ( λ_I^3 * 2^(3/2) ) )

Which brings us back to the same point.

Hmm, perhaps another approach is needed. Maybe I should compute the ratio of the translational partition functions using their formula.

The translational partition function Q_trans is (V/(λ³)) where λ = h / sqrt(2 π m k_B T).

So for I:

Q_I_trans = V / ( (h / sqrt(2 π m_I k_B T))³ ) = V (2 π m_I k_B T / h² )^(3/2) * (1/(h³)) ? Wait, perhaps more accurately:

λ = h / sqrt(2 π m k_B T)
So λ³ = h³ / (2 π m k_B T)^(3/2)
So 1/λ³ = (2 π m k_B T)^(3/2) / h³

Thus, Q_trans = V * (2 π m k_B T)^(3/2) / h³

So for I, Q_I_trans = V * (2 π m_I k_B T)^(3/2) / h³

For I2, Q_I2_trans = V * (2 π (2 m_I) k_B T)^(3/2) / h³

So the ratio (Q_I_trans)^2 / Q_I2_trans = [ (V * (2 π m_I k_B T)^(3/2) / h³ )^2 ] / [ V * (2 π (2 m_I) k_B T)^(3/2) / h³ ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: V² (2 π m_I k_B T)^(3) / h^6

Denominator: V (2 π 2 m_I k_B T)^(3/2) / h³

So the ratio becomes (V² (2 π m_I k_B T)^3 / h^6 ) ) * ( h³ / ( V (2 π 2 m_I k_B T )^(3/2) ) ) )

= V * (2 π m_I k_B T )^3 * h^3 / ( h^6 * (2 π 2 m_I k_B T )^(3/2) ) )

Simplify:

= V * (2 π m_I k_B T )^(3) / ( h^3 * (2 π 2 m_I k_B T )^(3/2) ) )

Factor out (2 π m_I k_B T )^(3/2) from numerator and denominator:

= V * (2 π m_I k_B T )^(3/2) * (2 π m_I k_B T )^(3/2) ) / ( h^3 * (2 π 2 m
