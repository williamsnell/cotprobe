Question:

InBrowningtown, water is sold to home owners by the cubic foot at the rate of $15.31 for up to and including 3,600 cubic feet, and $.15 for each 100 cubic feet over 3,600 cubic feet. Local taxes on water usage are 4%. If the Thomas family recently received a bill for 35,700 cubic feet of water, how much were they charged?

Options:

A: $64
B: $58
C: $70
D: $80
E: $66
F: $60
G: $78
H: $74
I: $72
J: $68

Okay, so I've got this problem about the Thomas family's water bill in Browningtown. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this kind of calculation, so I'll take it slow.

First, I'll read the problem again carefully. The water is sold at a certain rate, and there are additional charges based on usage. Plus, there's a local tax involved. The Thomas family used 35,700 cubic feet of water, and I need to find out their total charge.

Alright, the rates are as follows: up to and including 3,600 cubic feet, the cost is $15.31. Then, for anything over 3,600, it's $0.15 per 100 cubic feet. Oh wait, so the first 3,600 is a flat rate, and beyond that, it's a tiered rate based on how much more they use.

So, let's calculate the amount they used beyond 3,600. The total usage is 35,700, so subtracting 3,600 gives me 35,700 - 3,600. Let me do that math: 35,700 minus 3,600 is 32,100 cubic feet.

Now, the rate for the excess is $0.15 per 100 cubic feet. So I need to find how many 100 cubic feet units are in 32,100. That would be 32,100 divided by 100, which equals 321. So, there are 321 units of 100 cubic feet each.

Each of these units costs $0.15, so the cost for the excess is 321 multiplied by 0.15. Let me compute that: 321 * 0.15. Hmm, 300 * 0.15 is 45, and 21 * 0.15 is 3.15. So adding those together gives 45 + 3.15 = $48.15.

So, the total cost before tax is the initial 15.31 plus the excess 48.15. Let me add those: 15.31 + 48.15. That equals $63.46.

But wait, there's a 4% local tax on the water usage. So I need to calculate the tax on this amount. The tax would be 4% of $63.46. To find that, I multiply 63.46 by 0.04. Let me do that calculation: 63.46 * 0.04. Hmm, 60 * 0.04 is 2.40, and 3.46 * 0.04 is 0.1384. Adding them together gives 2.40 + 0.1384 = $2.5384. Rounding that to two decimal places, it's about $2.54.

Now, add the tax to the total cost before tax. So $63.46 + $2.54 equals $66.00. Wait, does that make sense? Let me check my math again.

Wait, no, wait. Let me recalculate the tax because sometimes when I do quick math, I might make a mistake. So 63.46 * 0.04: 63 * 0.04 is 2.52, and 0.46 * 0.04 is 0.0184. So total tax is 2.52 + 0.0184 = 2.5384, which is $2.54 when rounded. So adding that to 63.46 gives 63.46 + 2.54 = 66.00 exactly. So the total bill would be $66.

Looking at the options, option E is $66. So that's probably the correct answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything else in the problem.

Wait, the initial charge is for up to 3,600, including it. So yes, anything above that is charged at the extra rate. Yep, that's correct. And the calculations for the excess seem right. So I think the answer is E: $66.

The Thomas family's water bill is calculated based on the given rates and their usage of 35,700 cubic feet. 

1. **Initial Charge**: The first 3,600 cubic feet cost $15.31.  
2. **Excess Usage**: The remaining usage is 35,700 - 3,600 = 32,100 cubic feet. The rate for excess usage is $0.15 per 100 cubic feet.  
   - Number of 100 cubic feet units in 32,100: \( \frac{32,100}{100} = 321 \).  
   - Cost for excess usage: \( 321 \times 0.15 = 48.15 \).  
3. **Subtotal Before Tax**: \( 15.31 + 48.15 = 63.46 \).  
4. **Local Taxes**: A 4% tax is applied to the subtotal.  
   - Tax amount: \( 63.46 \times 0.04 = 2.54 \).  
5. **Total Bill**: \( 63.46 + 2.54 = 66.00 \).  

Thus, the total amount the Thomas family was charged is **$66**. 

The correct answer is **E**.
