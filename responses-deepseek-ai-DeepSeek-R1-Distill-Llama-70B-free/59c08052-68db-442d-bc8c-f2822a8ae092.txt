Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this CPA question. Let me read it carefully. The question is about a CPA who recklessly departs from the standards of due care during an audit. And we need to determine under which legal concept the CPA would be liable to third parties who are unknown to them.

Hmm, so I remember that CPAs can be liable under different legal theories when they perform audits negligently. The options given are A through J, each representing a different legal concept.

First, I should think about the key terms in the question. The CPA "recklessly departs from the standards of due care." Reckless behavior is more than just ordinary negligence. It implies a higher level of culpability, perhaps even gross negligence.

Now, the question is about liability to third parties who are unknown. So, I'm thinking about who can sue a CPA for their actions. In tort law, there's the concept of duty of care. Normally, a CPA's duty is primarily to the client, but sometimes third parties can also sue if they were foreseeable as being affected by the CPA's work.

Wait, but the options are about the type of law the CPA is liable under. So, not who can sue, but under what category.

I remember that when a CPA is negligent, they can be sued under negligence. But here, it's reckless, which is a bit more severe. So maybe it's gross negligence or something else.

Let me go through the options:

A: Unintentional tort. Negligence is an unintentional tort, but this is a broader category. The CPA's action is a type of negligence, so this might be possible, but I'm not sure if it's the most precise answer.

B: Gross negligence. This is when the negligence is so severe that it shows a disregard for the well-being of others. Recklessness might fall under this. So maybe B is a contender.

C: Fraud. That would require intent to deceive, which isn't mentioned here. The CPA is reckless, not intentionally fraudulent.

D: Breach of contract. This would be between the CPA and the client, but the question is about third parties. So probably not D.

E: Breach of warranty. Similar to contract, and again, third parties aren't a warranty issue here.

F: Negligence. This is the ordinary negligence. But the question says "recklessly," which might be more than ordinary negligence.

G: Misrepresentation. This could involve making false statements, but again, more about intent or knowledge, which isn't stated here.

H: Constructive fraud. This is about a breach of duty that equals fraud, but without intent. It's often linked to gross negligence. So this might be relevant.

I: Professional malpractice. This is a form of negligence specific to professionals, like CPAs. But malpractice typically refers to negligence in their professional duties, not necessarily the level of recklessness.

J: Strict liability. This applies when someone is liable regardless of fault, like product liability. CPAs aren't subject to strict liability for audits, so J is out.

So, putting it together: the CPA's action is reckless, which is more than ordinary negligence. So the possible options are B (Gross negligence) or H (Constructive fraud), or maybe I (Professional malpractice).

Wait, professional malpractice can include both negligence and gross negligence. But I think the specific term when it's reckless is constructive fraud. Because constructive fraud doesn't require actual intent but can be established by gross negligence or recklessness.

Alternatively, in some cases, gross negligence is a separate category. But I'm trying to remember the specific legal terms. Constructive fraud is when someone's actions, though not intended to defraud, are so reckless that they effectively amount to fraud.

So in this case, since the CPA recklessly departed from standards, it might be constructive fraud. That would make H the answer.

Alternatively, some sources might categorize this under gross negligence. But I think for the CPA exam, constructive fraud is the term used when there's reckless disregard for the truth, leading to injury. So the answer would be H.

Wait, but another angle: Under the law of negligence, a CPA can be liable to third parties under the concept of negligence if the third party is a foreseeable user of the financial statements. But the question is about the category of the law. So if it's just ordinary negligence, F is the answer. But the question specifies 'recklessly departs,' which is more than ordinary negligence.

So maybe the answer is B: Gross negligence.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Gross negligence is sometimes considered a separate tort, but in many jurisdictions, it's a form of negligence but more severe. Alternatively, constructive fraud might be the term used when the conduct is so reckless that it's equivalent to fraud.

Wait, in the context of auditors, when they are grossly negligent, it can be considered constructive fraud. For example, in some cases, the courts have held that CPAs can be liable for constructive fraud when their conduct is so reckless that it demonstrates a wanton disregard for the standards.

So perhaps H is the correct answer.

Alternatively, I might be mixing up terms. Let me try to recall: Professional negligence is often called malpractice. Gross negligence might be a step beyond ordinary negligence but not reaching the level of intent required for fraud.

But the question is about the law of which the CPA is liable. So the options are the categories of law.

Wait, another approach: The Ultramares Doctrine says that accountants are liable only to parties in privity (their clients) and foreseeable third parties. But that's about who can sue, not the type of claim.

So the type of claim would still be negligence or gross negligence. But if it's a reckless departure, is that considered gross negligence or constructive fraud?

In the Restatement (Second) of Torts, §552, it states that one who supplies false information for the guidance of others in their business transactions is liable for pecuniary loss caused by their justifiable reliance upon the information, if they failed to exercise reasonable care in obtaining or communicating the information. But that's about negligence.

But when the CPA acts with reckless disregard, it might fall under a different category. I think constructive fraud is when the conduct is so reckless that it's treated as if it were fraudulent. So in that case, the CPA could be liable under the theory of constructive fraud, which is a type of fraud but without the intent. So option H would apply.

Wait, but another thought: The question is about the law of what. So the options are the names of the legal theories. So if the CPA is liable under the theory of negligence, then the answer would be F. But if it's a higher level, like gross negligence, then B. Or if it's constructive fraud, then H.

In auditing, when an auditor departs from GAAS and someone is injured, the auditor can be liable for negligence. But if the departure was reckless, it might be considered gross negligence, which is a form of negligence but more severe.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again.

I recall that when a CPA is guilty of gross negligence, it can also be considered as constructive fraud. Constructive fraud doesn't require intent but can be established by showing reckless disregard for the truth. So in such cases, the CPA can be held liable under the theory of constructive fraud.

So the answer would be H: Constructive fraud.

Alternatively, some might argue that it's gross negligence under the law of negligence. But I think the specific term here is constructive fraud.

The question involves determining the legal theory under which a CPA would be liable to third parties unknown to them when recklessly departing from the standards of due care during an audit. The key terms in the question are "recklessly departs from the standards of due care" and "third parties who are unknown to the CPA." This suggests a higher level of culpability than ordinary negligence, as recklessness implies a disregard for the well-being of others.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Unintentional tort**—This is a broad category that includes negligence but is not specific enough to capture the severity of recklessness.
- **B: Gross negligence**—This involves a significant departure from the standard of care, more severe than ordinary negligence. It could apply here but may not fully capture the legal theory at play.
- **C: Fraud**—Requires intent to deceive, which is not explicitly mentioned in the question.
- **D: Breach of contract**—Applies to the CPA's client, not third parties.
- **E: Breach of warranty**—Similar to breach of contract and not relevant to third parties.
- **F: Negligence**—Applies to ordinary negligence but does not account for the reckless nature of the CPA's actions.
- **G: Misrepresentation**—Involves false statements, which are not explicitly mentioned here.
- **H: Constructive fraud**—Involves reckless disregard for the truth, which aligns with the CPA's actions. Constructive fraud does not require intent but can be established through gross negligence or recklessness.
- **I: Professional malpractice**—Refers to negligence in professional duties but does not specifically address recklessness.
- **J: Strict liability**—Does not apply to CPAs in this context.

Given the reckless nature of the CPA's actions, **constructive fraud** is the most appropriate legal theory, as it accounts for the reckless disregard for standards and the potential harm to third parties. While gross negligence is a close option, constructive fraud better captures the severity and legal implications of the CPA's conduct.

**Answer: H**
