Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem here. Let me read it again.

Part (a) says: What force is required to move a short-circuited conductor across a magnetic field of 5,000 gausses if the conductor is 100 centimeters long, moves at a uniform speed of 100 centimeters per second, and the circuit has a resistance of 0.04 ohms. Then part (b) asks the same but at 200 cm/s.

Hmm. I remember that when a conductor moves across a magnetic field, it induces an electromotive force (emf). Since it's short-circuited, the induced emf causes a current to flow. The force required to move the conductor is related to this current and the magnetic field.

Wait, the formula I think I need is F = B * I * l. Oh right, because the magnetic force on a current-carrying conductor is F = I * (l × B), and here the length is perpendicular to B, so it's F = B I l.

But wait, how do I find the current? Oh right, the induced emf (E) is given by E = B * v * l, where v is the velocity. Then, since the circuit is closed, the current I is E divided by resistance R. So I = E/R = (B v l) / R.

Putting that together, F = B * (B v l / R) * l. So F = B² v l² / R.

Wait, let's make sure about the units. Oh right, the problem gives everything in cgs units, right? Because gauss is cgs. But wait, the answer options are in pounds, which is an imperial unit. So I'll need to handle unit conversions.

Wait, but let me think about the steps again. So the force is equal to the magnetic Lorentz force, which in this case is the same as the mechanical force needed to move the conductor at constant speed because it's a short circuit. So mechanical power equals electrical power dissipated.

Alternatively, another approach: The power (P) used is F * v, since power is force times velocity. The electrical power dissipated is I² R. So F v = I² R.

But I is (B v l) / R. So substituting, F v = (B² v² l² / R²) * R = B² v² l² / R.

So F = (B² v l²) / R.

Wait, that's the same expression I got earlier. So yes, F = (B² v l²) / R.

Now, let's process the numbers.

Given:
B = 5000 gauss. Oh wait, I need to convert that to teslas because standard SI units would help. 1 tesla = 10^4 gauss, so 5000 gauss is 0.5 tesla.

But wait, the expression F is in what unit? Let me see. Since all the given units are in cgs, perhaps using cgs units for force would be better. Alternatively, maybe we can find the force in pounds directly.

Wait, another approach: in the cgs system, the formula for force in dynes would be F = (B^2 * v * l^2) / R.

Because in cgs, B is in gauss, v in cm/s, l in cm, R in ohms.

Wait, let me think about the units:

B in gauss (1 tesla = 10^4 gauss, and 1 gauss = 1e-4 T).

v in cm/s.

l in cm.

R in ohms.

So plugging into F = (B^2 v l^2)/R.

But the units for F would be (gauss^2 * cm/s * cm^2) / ohms.

Wait, but in cgs, the unit of force is dyne, and 1 dyne = 1 g·cm/s².

So let's check the units:

B is in gauss, which is (dyne^(1/2) cm^0 s^(-1)) in cgs, but maybe that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps better to convert all units to meters, kilograms, and tesla, then compute the force in newtons, and then convert to pounds.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to just use the formula in cgs units and then convert the final result to pounds.

Wait, let's try plugging in the numbers.

Given:

B = 5000 gauss = 5e3 G.

v = 100 cm/s.

l = 100 cm.

R = 0.04 ohms.

So F = ( (5e3)^2 * 100 * (100)^2 ) / 0.04.

Wait, let's compute that step by step.

First, compute B squared: (5e3)^2 = 25e6 G².

v is 100 cm/s.

l squared is (100 cm)^2 = 1e4 cm².

So numerator is 25e6 * 100 * 1e4 = 25e6 * 1e6 = 25e12.

Wait, no, wait: 25e6 (from B²) multiplied by 100 (v) is 25e8, then multiplied by 1e4 (l²) gives 25e12.

Denominator is 0.04.

So F = 25e12 / 0.04 = 625e12 = 6.25e14 (unit? Hmm, let's think about the units.)

Wait, no, perhaps I should compute the units properly. Because in cgs, the formula for F is in dynes.

Because in cgs, 1 dyne = g·cm/s².

So, let's compute F in dynes first, then convert to pounds.

So F = (B^2 * v * l^2) / R.

Plugging in the numbers:

B=5e3 G, v=100 cm/s, l=100 cm, R=0.04 ohm.

So F = ( (5e3)^2 * 100 * (100)^2 ) / 0.04.

Compute numerator:

5e3 squared is 25e6.

Multiply by 100: 25e6 * 1e2 = 25e8.

Multiply by (100)^2 = 1e4: 25e8 * 1e4 = 25e12.

Denominator is 0.04.

So F = 25e12 / 0.04 = 625e12 = 6.25e14 dynes.

Convert dynes to newtons: 1 dyne = 1e-5 N. So F = 6.25e14 * 1e-5 = 6.25e9 N? Wait, that can't be right because that's an extremely large force. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me recheck the formula.

Earlier, I thought F = B² v l² / R. But let me make sure about the formula.

Alternatively, let's think in terms of power. The mechanical power (F v) must equal the electrical power (I² R).

So F v = I² R.

But I is given by (B l v)/R, because E = B l v, and I = E/R.

So I = (B l v)/R.

Then, I^2 R = (B^2 l^2 v^2)/R^2 * R = (B² l² v²)/R.

So F v = (B² l² v²)/R => F = (B² l² v)/R.

Ah, so earlier formula was correct.

So F = (B^2 l^2 v) / R.

So perhaps I made an arithmetic mistake.

Let me compute F again, plugging the numbers:

B =5e3 G.

l=100 cm.

v=100 cm/s.

R=0.04 ohm.

So,

F = ( (5e3)^2 * (100)^2 * 100 ) / 0.04.

Compute numerator:

(5e3)^2 = 25e6.

100^2 = 1e4.

Multiply all terms: 25e6 * 1e4 = 25e10, then multiply by 100 gives 25e12.

Divide by 0.04: 25e12 / 0.04 = 625e12 = 6.25e14.

So F = 6.25e14 dynes.

But 1 dyne is 1e-5 N, so 6.25e14 * 1e-5 = 6.25e9 N. That's way too big. That can't be right. I must have messed up the unit conversion somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should not convert B to tesla. Because when all quantities are in cgs, the formula gives F in dynes. So perhaps I should compute the force in dynes and then convert to pounds.

Wait, 1 dyne = 2.248e-6 pounds-force. So let me compute F in dynes and then multiply by 2.248e-6 to get pounds.

So F = 6.25e14 dynes * (2.248e-6 lb/dyne) = ?

Let's compute this.

6.25e14 * 2.248e-6 = 6.25 * 2.248 * 1e8.

Compute 6.25 * 2.248.

6 * 2.248 = 13.488.

0.25 *2.248 = 0.562.

So total is approximately 14.05.

So 14.05e8 pounds? That's 1.405e9 pounds. That can't be right. I must be making a mistake.

Wait, this can't be correct because the options are about a few pounds. So I must have messed up the formula or the unit conversions.

Wait, maybe I should use SI units from the start.

Let me try converting all the given values to SI units.

B = 5000 gauss = 5000 / 10^4 = 0.5 T.

l = 100 cm = 1 meter.

v = 100 cm/s = 1 m/s.

R = 0.04 ohms.

So F = (B² l² v) / R.

Plugging in:

B = 0.5 T.

l = 1 m.

v = 1 m/s.

R = 0.04 ohm.

So F = (0.5^2 * 1^2 * 1) / 0.04.

Compute numerator: 0.25 * 1 * 1 = 0.25.

Divide by 0.04: 0.25 / 0.04 = 6.25 N.

Now, convert newtons to pounds. 1 N is approximately 0.2248 pounds.

So 6.25 N * 0.2248 lb/N ≈ 1.405 lb.

So that's about 1.4 pounds for part (a).

Wait, but the options don't have exactly 1.4, but looking at the options, option I is 1.4 and 2.8, but let's double-check the numbers.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, why is F = (B² l² v) / R?

Alternatively, let me think again. F is the force needed, which is equal to the magnetic force opposing the motion, which is I * l * B. But I is E/R, and E is B * v * l. So I = (B v l)/R. Thus, F = I l B = (B v l / R) * l * B) = (B² l² v)/R. So that's correct.

So using SI units, I get F = 0.25 * 1 * 1 / 0.04 = 6.25 N, which is about 1.405 lb.

Looking at the options, option I is (a)1.4 lb and (b)2.8 lb. So part (a) is 1.4 lb, and part (b) would be double, since v is doubled.

Wait, part (b) has v = 200 cm/s = 2 m/s.

So F would be (0.5^2 * 1^2 * 2) / 0.04 = (0.25 * 2) / 0.04 = 0.5 / 0.04 = 12.5 N.

12.5 N is about 12.5 * 0.2248 ≈ 2.8 lb.

So the answers are 1.4 lb and 2.8 lb, which is option I.

But looking at the options, option I is (a) 1.4 and (b) 2.8. So the correct answer would be I.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

Alternative approach: Using the power method.

Power P = F v = I² R.

Compute I: E = B l v. I = E/R = (B l v)/R.

So I = (0.5 T * 1 m * 1 m/s) / 0.04 ohm = (0.5) / 0.04 = 12.5 A.

Then, P = I² R = (12.5)^2 * 0.04 = 156.25 * 0.04 = 6.25 W.

But P is also F v, so F v = 6.25 W => F = 6.25 W / v. v is 1 m/s, so F =6.25 N, which is same as before. So about 1.405 lb.

Similarly, for part (b), v is 2 m/s.

I = (0.5 * 1 * 2)/0.04 = (1)/0.04 =25 A.

P = I² R = 625 * 0.04 =25 W.

F v =25 => F=25/2=12.5 N, which is about 2.8 lb.

So yes, option I is correct.

To solve the problem, we use the relationship between the force required to move a conductor in a magnetic field and the induced current. The force \( F \) is given by:

\[
F = \frac{B^2 l^2 v}{R}
\]

where:
- \( B \) is the magnetic field strength,
- \( l \) is the length of the conductor,
- \( v \) is the velocity of the conductor,
- \( R \) is the resistance of the circuit.

### Part (a)
Given:
- \( B = 5000 \, \text{gauss} = 0.5 \, \text{T} \),
- \( l = 100 \, \text{cm} = 1 \, \text{m} \),
- \( v = 100 \, \text{cm/s} = 1 \, \text{m/s} \),
- \( R = 0.04 \, \Omega \),

we calculate:

\[
F = \frac{(0.5)^2 (1)^2 (1)}{0.04} = \frac{0.25}{0.04} = 6.25 \, \text{N}.
\]

Converting to pounds (\( 1 \, \text{N} = 0.2248 \, \text{lb} \)):

\[
F = 6.25 \times 0.2248 \approx 1.4 \, \text{lb}.
\]

### Part (b)
For \( v = 200 \, \text{cm/s} = 2 \, \text{m/s} \), the force is proportional to \( v \). Thus:

\[
F = 2 \times 1.4 = 2.8 \, \text{lb}.
\]

### Final Answer
The forces required are \( 1.4 \, \text{lb} \) for part (a) and \( 2.8 \, \text{lb} \) for part (b). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**I: 1.4 pounds and 2.8 pounds.**
