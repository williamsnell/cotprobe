Question:

The average number of calories in Yum-Yum Good candy bars is 210, with a standard deviation of 10. If the number of calories per candy bar is normally distributed, what percent of candy bars contain more than 225 calories?

Options:

A: 93.32%
B: 43.30%
C: 6.68%
D: 47.70%
E: 10.00%
F: 66.80%
G: 52.30%
H: 33.20%
I: 56.70%
J: 5.00%

Okay, so I need to figure out this problem about the candy bars and their calories. Let me read it again carefully.

The average calories are 210, standard deviation is 10. The distribution is normal. I need to find the percentage of candy bars that have more than 225 calories.

Hmm, right. So since it's a normal distribution, I can use Z-scores to find this. I remember that Z-scores tell us how many standard deviations away a value is from the mean.

So, the formula for Z is (X - μ) / σ. Here, X is 225, μ is 210, and σ is 10. Let me calculate that.

Z = (225 - 210) / 10 = 15 /10 = 1.5.

Okay, so the Z-score is 1.5. Now I need to find the probability that a value is greater than 225, which corresponds to a Z greater than 1.5.

Wait, the standard normal distribution table gives the area to the left of the Z-score. So the area to the left of 1.5 is the probability that Z is less than 1.5. Then, the area to the right (which is what we want) would be 1 minus that value.

I think the table says that for Z=1.5, the cumulative probability is about 0.9332. So the area beyond that is 1 - 0.9332 = 0.0668, which is 6.68%.

Wait, but let me think again. Oh right, yes. So the percentage is 6.68%, which would correspond to option C.

But wait, let me double-check the Z-table. I remember that Z=1.5 is at the 93.32 percentile. So yes, 93.32% of the data is below 1.5, meaning 6.68% is above. So the candy bars with more than 225 calories are 6.68% of the total.

So looking at the options, option C is 6.68%. That should be the correct answer.

To determine the percentage of Yum-Yum Good candy bars that contain more than 225 calories, we start by noting that the calorie content is normally distributed with a mean (μ) of 210 and a standard deviation (σ) of 10. 

First, we calculate the Z-score for 225 calories using the formula:

\[
Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
Z = \frac{225 - 210}{10} = \frac{15}{10} = 1.5
\]

The Z-score of 1.5 indicates that 225 calories is 1.5 standard deviations above the mean. Using the standard normal distribution table, the cumulative probability for a Z-score of 1.5 is approximately 0.9332. This represents the proportion of candy bars with calorie content less than or equal to 225. To find the proportion of candy bars with more than 225 calories, we subtract this value from 1:

\[
P(X > 225) = 1 - 0.9332 = 0.0668 \, \text{or} \, 6.68\%.
\]

Thus, the percentage of candy bars containing more than 225 calories is 6.68%, which corresponds to option C.
