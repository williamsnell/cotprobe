Okay, so I've got this question here about transformations when converting between the total number of errors and percent correct on a test. Hmm, let me think about what each of these terms means.

The question is asking what type of transformation we're performing when we switch between total errors and percent correct. So, I need to figure out the relationship between these two variables.

Alright, let's break it down. Let's say there are a certain number of questions on the test. Suppose the test has, say, 20 questions. If I got 5 wrong, then my number of errors is 5. To get the percent correct, I subtract the errors from the total and then convert that to a percentage. So, 20-5=15 correct, which would be 15/20 = 0.75, or 75% correct.

Wait, so the total errors are being subtracted from the total number of questions, and then we're calculating what percentage that correct number is of the total. So the formula for percent correct would be ((Total questions - Errors) / Total questions) * 100.

Let me write that as a formula. Let me denote E as the number of errors, T as the total questions, and P as the percent correct. So P = ((T - E)/T) * 100. Simplifying that, P = (1 - E/T) * 100.

Wait, so if I solve for E in terms of P, what do I get? Let's see. Let's rearrange the equation.

P = (1 - E/T) * 100
Divide both sides by 100: P/100 = 1 - E/T
Rearranged, E/T = 1 - P/100
Multiply both sides by T: E = T (1 - P/100)

So E = T - (T * P)/100. Hmm, that's interesting. So E is a linear function of P, because if I plot E against P, the equation is E = T - (T/100) P.

Wait, that's a linear equation. Because E equals a constant (T) minus another constant (T/100) multiplied by P. There's no exponent or anything else complicating it. So the relationship between E and P is linear.

So when we convert between them, we're applying a linear transformation. That would mean the transformation is linear.

Looking at the options, option I is Linear.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. Sometimes, transformations can be non-linear even if it looks linear on the surface. But in this case, the formula is E = a - bP, where a and b are constants. So it's a straight line with a negative slope. So it's definitely a linear relationship.

So the answer should be I: Linear.

When converting the total number of errors on a test to percent correct, or vice versa, the relationship between the two variables is linear. This is because the formula for percent correct, \( P \), in terms of the number of errors, \( E \), and the total number of questions, \( T \), is given by:

\[
P = \left(1 - \frac{E}{T}\right) \times 100
\]

Rearranging this equation to express \( E \) in terms of \( P \), we get:

\[
E = T \left(1 - \frac{P}{100}\right)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
E = T - \frac{T}{100}P
\]

This is a linear equation, as \( E \) is expressed as a constant minus another constant multiplied by \( P \). There are no exponents, logarithms, or other nonlinear terms. Therefore, the transformation between the total number of errors and percent correct is linear.

The correct answer is:

I: Linear
