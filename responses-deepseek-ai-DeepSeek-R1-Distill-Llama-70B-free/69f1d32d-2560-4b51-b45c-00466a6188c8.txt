Okay, so I've got this question about electrical circuits, specifically dealing with lamps connected in parallel and how that affects the current in the power source. Hmm, I remember that in parallel circuits, the current can split through each branch. Wait, but how does adding more lamps change the total current?

Let me think. Oh right, when you add more lamps in parallel, each lamp provides an additional path for the current. So the total current from the power source increases because each lamp draws its own current. But wait, the voltage stays the same since it's a parallel connection. So each lamp will have the same voltage across them, right?

Wait, if the voltage is the same for each lamp, then each lamp will draw the same amount of current as if it were the only one connected. So if I have two lamps, each drawing I current, then the total current would be 2I. If I add a third lamp, it's 3I, and so on. So the more lamps I add, the higher the total current will be from the power source.

But wait, isn't that assuming each lamp has the same resistance? Oh, right, because in reality, if the lamps have different resistances, the current each draws would vary. But the question doesn't specify different lamps, so I guess we can assume they're identical.

So as each lamp is added in parallel, the total current increases. Therefore, the answer should be that the current increases. Looking at the options, option A says 'increases', which matches my reasoning.

Wait, but what if the power source has a limited capacity? Like, if the source can't handle more current, maybe the voltage would drop. But the question is about the current in the power source, not the voltage. So assuming the power source can supply the needed current, the current would go up as more lamps are connected.

I think I'm confident now. The correct answer should be A.

When lamps are connected in parallel, each lamp provides an additional path for the current, causing the total current drawn from the power source to increase. Since the voltage remains constant in a parallel circuit, each lamp draws its own current, and the total current is the sum of the currents through all the lamps. Therefore, as more lamps are added, the total current from the power source increases.

The correct answer is **A: increases.**
