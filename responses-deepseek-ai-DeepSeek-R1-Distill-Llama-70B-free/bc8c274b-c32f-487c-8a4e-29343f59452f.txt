Okay, so I have this probability question here about a deck of cards, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me think through this step by step. 

Alright, the question says that a deck is thoroughly shuffled, and a card is drawn. We need to find the probability that the card is the ace of diamonds. Hmm, okay, I remember that a standard deck has 52 cards. Right, because there are 4 suits, each with 13 cards. So 4 times 13 is 52.

Now, probability is about the chance of a specific event happening. The basic formula is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the favorable outcome is drawing the ace of diamonds. How many aces of diamonds are there in a deck? Just one, I think. Because each suit has one ace, and diamonds is one of the four suits.

So the number of favorable outcomes is 1. The total possible outcomes when drawing one card is 52, since that's the total number of cards. So putting that together, the probability should be 1 divided by 52. Let me check the options to see which one matches that.

Looking at the options: option H is 1/52. That seems to fit. Wait, are there any other aces or diamonds that I'm missing here? No, the question specifically asks for the ace of diamonds, not any ace or any diamond. So it's only that one card. So yes, 1 out of 52.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The deck is shuffled, but that shouldn't affect the probability because each card has an equal chance of being on top. So the answer should be option H.

The probability of drawing the ace of diamonds from a standard deck of 52 cards is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes (1 ace of diamonds) by the total number of possible outcomes (52 cards). This gives a probability of 1/52.
