Okay, so I have this question about facial expressions, and I need to figure out which one isn't considered a primary facial expression. The options are A through F, and I think they're all emotions, but I'm a bit fuzzy on which are primary. Let me think.

I remember that Paul Ekman did a lot of work on facial expressions and emotions. He identified six basic emotions that are universally recognized. I think those are happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust. So those would be primary. Let me list them out: happy, sad, angry, afraid, surprised, disgusted. So that's six.

Looking at the options given: A is surprise, which I know is one of them. B is contempt, which sounds familiar but I'm not sure. C is fear, which is definitely a primary one. D is sadness, another primary. E is anger, yes. F is disgust, which is also primary.

So the question is asking which is not a primary expression. The options are the six I listed except one. Wait, the options are A-F, which include surprise (A), contempt (B), fear (C), sadness (D), anger (E), disgust (F). So the primary ones are A, C, D, E, F. So the one that's not primary is B, contempt.

Wait, but I thought contempt might have been considered a secondary emotion or a variation. Oh right, in Ekman's work, the six primary emotions don't include contempt. Contempt is more of a social emotion and isn't one of the basic six. So the answer should be B: contempt.

The question asks which of the listed options is not considered a primary facial expression. Based on Paul Ekman's work, the six universally recognized primary emotions are happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust. Among the options provided, contempt (B) is not one of these primary emotions. 

Answer: B
