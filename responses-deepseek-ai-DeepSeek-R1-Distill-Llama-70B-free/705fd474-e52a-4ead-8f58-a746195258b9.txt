Okay, so I have this problem here where Joe and Mike ran the same race. Joe finished 4 minutes before Mike. Mike finished at 4:02 p.m., and I need to find out what time Joe finished. 

Alright, let's break this down. If Mike finished at 4:02, and Joe was faster, Joe must have finished earlier than that. The question is, how much earlier? It says Joe finished 4 minutes before Mike. So I need to subtract 4 minutes from Mike's finish time.

Wait, how do I subtract minutes from a specific time? Let me think. So Mike's time is 4:02 p.m. If I take away 4 minutes, that should give me Joe's time. 

So, 4:02 minus 4 minutes. Let me do the subtraction. 4:02 minus 0:04 is 3:58 p.m. Because 4:02 minus 4 minutes would take me back to 3:58. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 4:02, if I subtract 4 minutes, I go back to 3:58? Let me make sure. 

Let me count backwards from 4:02. One minute back is 4:01, two minutes back is 4:00, three minutes back is 3:59, four minutes back is 3:58. Oh, wait, no, wait a second. Wait, 4:02 minus 4 minutes... Hmm. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the hours. 

Wait, no, 4:02 is 4 hours and 2 minutes. Subtracting 4 minutes from that would be 4 hours and (2-4) minutes. But wait, 2-4 is negative, so I need to borrow an hour. So, 4 hours is 3 hours plus 60 minutes. So 3 hours and 60 + 2 = 62 minutes. Subtract 4 minutes from 62 minutes: 62-4=58 minutes. So the time becomes 3:58 p.m. So Joe finished at 3:58 p.m. 

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check. Option E is 3:58 p.m. So that should be the correct answer. 

Wait, but let me think again. Sometimes when subtracting time, it's easy to make a mistake. So Mike finished at 4:02, Joe 4 minutes earlier. So 4:02 minus 4 minutes. 

Another way: 4:02 minus 4 minutes is the same as 3:58. Because 4:00 minus 2 minutes is 3:58. So yes, that's correct. 

So looking at the options, option E is 3:58 p.m., which should be the right choice.

The correct answer is E: 3:58 p.m. 

Mike finished the race at 4:02 p.m., and since Joe finished 4 minutes earlier, subtracting 4 minutes from 4:02 p.m. gives 3:58 p.m.
