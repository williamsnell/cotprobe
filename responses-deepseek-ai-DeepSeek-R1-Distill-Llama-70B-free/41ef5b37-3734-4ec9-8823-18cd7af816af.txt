Okay, so I've got this problem here about Bob's Camera Shop reducing the price of their worst-selling camera. The camera was originally $65, and they reduced the price by 8 and 1/3 percent. Hmm, I need to find out the new selling price. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that percentage reductions involve calculating a certain percentage of the original price and then subtracting that from the original. So the formula should be something like New Price = Original Price - (Original Price * Reduction Percentage). 

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. Yeah, that sounds right. So the reduction is 8 1/3 percent. I need to convert that mixed number into a decimal or a fraction to calculate it. 8 1/3 percent. Well, 1/3 is approximately 0.333..., right? So 8.333... percent. But maybe it's easier to handle it as a fraction. 

Wait, 8 1/3 percent can also be written as 8.333...%, which is 8 + 1/3 percent. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no, 8 1/3 percent is 8 and a third percent, which is 8.333...%. So yeah, 8.333% as a decimal would be 0.083333 when I divide by 100.

So the reduction amount would be 65 multiplied by 0.083333. Then subtract that from 65 to get the new price.

Let me calculate that. 65 * 0.083333. Hmm, maybe I can think of this as 65 * (1/12) because 1/3 percent is like 0.333...%, but wait, 8 1/3 percent is 25/3 percent, which is 8.333...%. Wait, wait, 1/3 is 0.333..., so 8.333% is 8 and 1/3 percent. So 8.333% is 83.333... per 1000, but I think I'm complicating this. Let me just compute 65 * 0.083333.

Alternatively, I can compute 8 1/3 percent of 65. So 8% of 65 is straightforward. 8% is 0.08 in decimal. So 65 * 0.08 equals... let's see, 65 * 0.08 is 5.2. Then, the 1/3 percent. 1% of 65 is 0.65, so 1/3 of that is approximately 0.216666... So adding 5.2 and 0.216666 gives me 5.416666... So the total reduction is about $5.416666.

Wait, wait, but wait a second. Is that correct? Because 8 1/3 percent is 8.333...%, so 65 * 0.083333 should give me the exact amount. Let me compute that. 65 * 0.083333. Hmm, 0.083333 is 1/12, right? Because 1/12 is approximately 0.083333. So 65 divided by 12 would give the same result.

So 65 / 12. Let's compute that. 12 * 5 is 60, so 5 with a remainder of 5. 5 divided by 12 is approximately 0.416666. So 5.416666... So that matches. So the reduction is $5.416666.

Now, subtracting that from the original $65. So 65 - 5.416666 equals... 65 minus 5 is 60, and then minus 0.416666 is 59.583333... So that would be approximately $59.583333.

Wait, but looking at the options, I need to see which one matches this. Let me check the options again. The options are A: $64.58, B: $60.08, C: $63.58, D: $57.58, E: $60.58, F: $58.58, G: $61.58, H: $59.58, I: $56.58, J: $62.58.

So my calculation came to approximately $59.583333, which would round to $59.58. Looking at the options, H is $59.58. So that's the one.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let's go through it again. 8 1/3 percent is 8.333...%, which is 0.083333 in decimal. So 65 * 0.083333.

Alternatively, 8.333% of 65. Let me compute 65 * 8 = 520, and 65 * 0.333...% is 65 * 0.003333... which is approximately 0.216666. So total reduction is 5.2 + 0.216666 = 5.416666. Subtracting from 65 gives 59.583333, which is $59.583333. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but another way to calculate 8 1/3 percent is 25/3 percent, because 8 is 24/3, so 24/3 + 1/3 is 25/3 percent. So 25/3 percent is 25/3 divided by 100, which is 25/(3*100) = 25/300 = 1/12. So 1/12 of 65 is 65/12.

Calculating 65 divided by 12: 12*5=60, remainder 5. So 5/12 is 0.416666. So 65/12 = 5.416666. So the reduction is $5.416666. Subtracting that from 65 gives 59.583333, which is $59.58 when rounded to the nearest cent. So the correct answer is H.

To determine the new selling price of the camera after a price reduction of \(8\frac{1}{3}\%\), we start with the original price of \$65. The reduction percentage can be converted to a decimal as follows:

\[
8\frac{1}{3}\% = 8.333\ldots\% = 0.083333\ldots
\]

The reduction amount is calculated by multiplying the original price by this decimal:

\[
\text{Reduction Amount} = 65 \times 0.083333 = 5.416666\ldots
\]

Subtracting this reduction from the original price gives the new selling price:

\[
\text{New Price} = 65 - 5.416666 = 59.583333\ldots
\]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the new price is approximately \$59.58. Comparing this result to the provided options, the correct answer is:

**H: \$59.58**

Answer: H
