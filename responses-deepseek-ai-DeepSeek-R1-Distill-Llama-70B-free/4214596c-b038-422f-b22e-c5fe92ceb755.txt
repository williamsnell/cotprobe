Okay, so I've got this question about Baxter's view on environmental solutions. Hmm, I remember Baxter was an environmental philosopher or something like that. The question is about the first step towards solving environmental problems, and the key point is recognizing the objective.

The question says that our objective isn't pure air or water. So, the answer isn't about making everything perfectly clean. I think Baxter argued against the idea that zero pollution is the goal because it's not realistic and might not even be desirable in all cases. Like, some pollution might be acceptable if it supports human life and activities without causing harm.

Looking at the options, let's go through them. 

Option A: Introduction of new species. Doesn't seem right. The question is about the objective, not a method to achieve it.

Option B: Maintaining current pollution levels. That doesn't sound like a solution step. It's more like the status quo, which probably isn't the first step towards solving problems.

Option C: Overall maximally clean environment. Wait, the question says the objective isn't pure air or water, so a maximally clean environment might be similar to that. So C might not be the right choice.

Option D: Elimination of harmful species. Again, this is a method, not the primary objective.

Option E: Maximal state of pollution. No, that sounds bad. We don't want more pollution.

Option F: Eradication of all pollution. This aligns with pure air and water, which the question says isn't the objective. So F is out.

Option G: Environment free from human interference. That's like a pristine wilderness idea, but maybe Baxter's point is that some human impact is acceptable as long as it's balanced.

Option H: Pollution that supports human health and well-being. This sounds promising. If the goal isn't zero pollution, but a level that allows humans to thrive without harming the environment too much, then H could be it.

Option I: Optimal state of pollution. "Optimal" suggests a balance, not necessarily zero. So this could also fit. Wait, what's the difference between H and I? H mentions supporting human health, I is about optimal state. I think Baxter's argument was that the optimal level isn't zero but a balance. So maybe I is correct.

Wait, but another thought: the question is about the first step being recognition of the objective. So the objective is not pure air, but perhaps a balance where pollution is at an optimal level. So maybe the answer is I, some optimal state.

But wait, in the original question, the answer might be H because it's about supporting human health and well-being, which is a specific optimal state considering human needs. Or I think Baxter's view was more about optimal, not necessarily tied to health but a balance in the environment.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about what Baxter actually said. I remember that he believed in a balance, not eliminating all pollution, but finding a level that's optimal. So the optimal state would be the correct objective.

Looking back at the options, H says "a state of pollution that supports human health and well-being." That seems more specific, while I is about "some optimal state of pollution." I think the correct answer is I because it's about finding the optimal level, which could vary depending on context and doesn't necessarily tie directly to human health, although that's a factor.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. If the objective is not pure air or water, but rather a state where pollution is at a level that's best for overall well-being, that could be either H or I. 

Wait, the question says "the first and foremost step toward a solution is a clear recognition that our objective is not pure air or water but rather..." So the answer is what the objective should be. 

I think Baxter's point is that the goal isn't zero pollution, but a balanced level where the environment is healthy enough to support humans and ecosystems. So perhaps the optimal state (I) is correct.

Alternatively, I'm remembering that the optimal state is about finding a balance point, not necessarily the maximum. So, the correct answer is I.

In Baxter's view, the first and foremost step toward solving environmental problems is recognizing that the objective is not pure air or water but rather achieving a balanced state. The question emphasizes that the goal is not zero pollution but a level of pollution that supports overall well-being. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A, D, G**: These focus on methods or extremes that do not align with Baxter's balanced approach.
- **B, E**: These suggest maintaining or increasing pollution, which contradicts the idea of solving environmental problems.
- **C, F**: These imply a maximally clean environment or eradication of pollution, which Baxter argues against as unrealistic and not the primary objective.
- **H**: Suggests a state of pollution that supports human health and well-being, which is a specific and positive framing.
- **I**: Refers to an optimal state of pollution, emphasizing balance and context-dependent solutions, which aligns closely with Baxter's argument.

While H is compelling, Baxter's emphasis on finding a balance suggests that the broader concept of an "optimal state" (I) is more accurate. This optimal state considers human needs and environmental sustainability without being overly restrictive.

Answer: I
