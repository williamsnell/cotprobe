Okay, so I've got this question about sunspots and the solar cycle. Hmm, I remember that sunspots are those dark areas on the Sun's surface, right? They appear and disappear, and their number changes over time. The question is asking about the period when their number highly increases every so many years. I think this has something to do with the solar cycle.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact number of years. I remember it's not too long, maybe around a decade? Like 10 years or so? But wait, I'm not sure if it's exactly 10 or another number close to that. I think the solar cycle is actually around 11 years. Yeah, that sounds familiar. I've heard that the Sun goes through an 11-year cycle where sunspots increase and then decrease. 

So the options given are A through J, with numbers from 7 to 20. Looking at the options, D is 11. So the correct answer should be D. But wait, why did I think it was 10? Maybe I confused it with something else. Let me think again. Oh right, the Schwabe cycle is the 11-year solar cycle, named after Heinrich Schwabe who discovered it. So that's solid proof it's 11 years. 

I don't think it's 10, because that's more like a human decade, but the Sun's cycle is a bit longer than that. So I'm confident now that the answer is D: 11.

The solar cycle, during which sunspots increase in number, lasts approximately 11 years. This is known as the Schwabe cycle. 

D: 11

Answer: D
