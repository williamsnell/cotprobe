Okay, I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about case studies in qualitative research. So, first, I need to understand what the question is asking. The question is asking which statement about case studies cannot be correct.

The options are from A to I, and I need to figure out the incorrect one. Let's go through each option one by one, but I should probably start by recalling what I know about case studies.

Case studies are a research method that involves a detailed examination of a single case or a small number of cases. They are often used in qualitative research to gain an in-depth understanding of a particular situation, person, event, or phenomenon. They typically involve multiple sources of data, like interviews, observations, and documents, to provide a comprehensive view.

Now, let's go through each option.

Option A: Case studies are based on the assumption that the case can be generalized. Hmm, wait. I remember that case studies are usually not about generalization. They focus on depth rather than breadth. So they don't assume that the case can be generalized to a larger population. So this statement might be incorrect. But I'll keep this in mind and check the other options.

Option B: Case studies do not rely on multiple sources of information. No, that's not right. Case studies often use multiple sources, like triangulation, to get a complete picture. So this statement is incorrect. But wait, the question is asking which cannot be correct, so if B is an incorrect statement, then it's a possible answer. But I need to check all options.

Option C: Case studies are always conducted over a short period of time. That doesn't sound right. Some case studies, especially longitudinal ones, can take a long time, even years. So this statement is incorrect. But again, I'm looking for the one that cannot be correct.

Option D: Case studies always require a large sample size for accurate results. No, case studies usually have a small sample size, sometimes just one case. So this is definitely incorrect. But I need to see which one is the answer.

Option E: Case studies can only be used in the field of psychology. No, that's wrong. Case studies are used in many fields like sociology, business, education, etc. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Case studies are a detailed examination of a single case. Yes, that's correct. So F is a correct statement, so it's not the answer.

Option G: Case studies are used for attitude measurement, preferences, & satisfaction. I think case studies can be used for that, but they're more about understanding processes and contexts. But I'm not sure if this is incorrect. Maybe it's possible, but I'm not certain. I'll keep this in mind.

Option H: Case studies are most useful as a pilot study to identify variables for other studies. Yes, that's correct. They can help in exploratory research to generate hypotheses. So H is correct.

Option I: Case studies do not provide in-depth understanding of a particular instance. No, that's wrong because case studies are all about providing in-depth understanding. So I is incorrect.

Now, the question is which statement cannot be correct. So I need to find the option that is an incorrect statement about case studies.

Looking back, the question is about which cannot be correct.

Option A says case studies assume generalization. Since case studies don't generalize, A is incorrect.

Option B says they don't use multiple sources. But they do, so B is incorrect.

Option C says always short period. No, some take long, so C is incorrect.

Option D says require large sample. No, case studies have small samples, so D is incorrect.

Option E says only in psychology. No, used in many fields, so E is incorrect.

Option F is correct.

Option G: Not sure, but maybe they can be used for attitude measurements.

Option I is incorrect.

Wait, the question is about which statement cannot be correct, so I need to choose the one that is wrong about case studies.

So looking at the options, let's see which ones are incorrect.

The incorrect statements about case studies would be the ones that go against what case studies actually do.

So, let's list which options are incorrect:

A: Incorrect. Case studies don't generalize.

B: Incorrect. They do use multiple sources.

C: Incorrect. They can take a long time.

D: Incorrect. They don't need large samples.

E: Incorrect. Used in various fields.

I: Incorrect. They do provide in-depth understanding.

So the question is which cannot be correct, so any of A, B, C, D, E, I are incorrect statements.

But the question asks which one cannot be correct, so the correct answer is the statement that is incorrect about case studies.

Wait, the question is phrased as "which one out of the following statements about CASE STUDIES can not be correct?"

So we need to find the statement that is not correct, i.e., the false statement about case studies.

So all the options that are false are possible answers, but the question is which one is not correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

The options are about what case studies are or aren't. So, which is an incorrect statement.

So let's go through each:

A: They are based on generalization assumption. Wrong, so A is incorrect.

B: Do not rely on multiple sources. Wrong, case studies use multiple sources, so B is incorrect.

C: Always short period. No, some are long-term, so C is incorrect.

D: Always require large sample. No, case studies have small samples, so D is incorrect.

E: Only in psychology. No, so E is incorrect.

I: Do not provide in-depth. Wrong, they do, so I is incorrect.

So the options A, B, C, D, E, I are all incorrect statements about case studies.

Wait, but the options are presented as possible statements, and the question is which cannot be correct.

So the correct answer is the one that is incorrect.

But the options are structured as possible statements, and we need to find which is incorrect.

The question is: when a qualitative research is done, theory is developed from data, not before, and helps refine hypotheses. So in that context, which statement about case studies is incorrect.

Wait, the question is about case studies, so perhaps I should recall more about case studies.

So, case studies are in-depth, detailed analyses of a single case or a small number of cases. They are descriptive and exploratory. They don't aim for generalization, they aim for depth.

So, looking back:

Option A: Case studies assume generalization. No, they don't, so A is an incorrect statement.

Option B: Do not rely on multiple sources. No, they do, so B is incorrect.

Option C: Always short time. No, some are longitudinal, so C is incorrect.

Option D: Need large sample size. No, they have small samples, so D is incorrect.

Option E: Only in psychology. No, so E is incorrect.

Option I: Do not provide in-depth. No, they do, so I is incorrect.

So, all of these are incorrect except F, H, and G.

Wait, but the question asks which cannot be correct, so which of these is an incorrect statement about case studies.

The options are A through I, and I have to pick the one that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the best approach is to find which option is correct and eliminate the others.

Wait, the question is which statement cannot be correct, i.e., which is an incorrect statement about case studies.

So, which of these statements is false?

So, the correct answer is the statement that is false about case studies.

Looking back, the options that are false:

A: False, case studies don't assume generalization.

B: False, they do use multiple sources.

C: False, some take long.

D: False, sample size is small.

E: False, used in other fields.

I: False, they do provide in-depth.

So, the question is which one cannot be correct, which means which statement is incorrect about case studies.

So, all of A, B, C, D, E, I are incorrect.

Wait, but the options are all possible, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, the question is about which statement cannot be correct, so it's the one that is not true about case studies.

So, for example, if an option says case studies are used for attitude measurement, is that correct?

Option G says case studies are used for attitude measurement, preferences, & satisfaction. I'm not sure about this. While case studies can include aspects of attitude, their primary focus is on a detailed examination. But I think that case studies can be used for that, but it's not their primary purpose. So G might be correct, but I'm not certain.

Wait, I think case studies can be used in various ways, including understanding attitudes or preferences, but it's not their main use. So G could be a correct statement, meaning it's not the incorrect one we're looking for.

Now, looking at the options, the correct answer should be the one that is an incorrect statement about case studies.

The question gives us options, and we need to find the incorrect one.

So, the options that are incorrect (false about case studies) are A, B, C, D, E, I.

Now, the question is which one cannot be correct, i.e., which is false.

But the options are presented as possible statements, so the correct answer is the statement that is not correct about case studies.

So, the correct answer would be one of these.

Wait, perhaps the question is a bit tricky. Let me think about each option again.

Option C: Case studies are always conducted over a short period of time.

Is that correct? No, because some case studies are longitudinal, spanning months or years. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Always require large sample size. No, case studies usually have a small sample size, sometimes just one case. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Only in psychology. No, case studies are used in many fields. So E is incorrect.

Option I: Do not provide in-depth understanding. No, that's the opposite of what they do. So I is incorrect.

So, all of these are incorrect. But the question is which one cannot be correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is I. Because case studies are known for providing in-depth understanding. So option I says they do not, which is incorrect.

But the question is which cannot be correct, meaning which is an incorrect statement.

So all of A, B, C, D, E, I are incorrect, but the question is which one is not correct.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the most incorrect one.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, because case studies don't require a large sample size, so D is incorrect.

But the question is about which statement cannot be correct, i.e., which is false.

Wait, the options are statements about case studies, and we need to pick the incorrect one.

So, the correct answer is the statement that is not true about case studies.

So, for example, option B says case studies do not rely on multiple sources. But in reality, they do rely on multiple sources, so B is incorrect.

But I'm a bit confused because I have multiple incorrect options.

Wait, perhaps the question is designed so that only one option is incorrect. But in reality, multiple are incorrect. However, the question asks which one cannot be correct.

Wait, perhaps I should read the options again.

Option D says case studies always require a large sample size. That's definitely incorrect because case studies typically focus on a single case or a small number of cases, not large samples.

Option I: Case studies do not provide in-depth understanding. That's incorrect because they do provide in-depth understanding.

Option C: Always conducted over a short period. That's incorrect.

Option B: Do not rely on multiple sources. That's incorrect.

Option A: Assume generalization. Incorrect.

Option E: Only in psychology. Incorrect.

So, the question is which of these is not correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is I because it's the opposite of what case studies do. They are known for in-depth analysis.

But the question is about which statement cannot be correct, so the incorrect statement is the one that is false about case studies.

So, all of A, B, C, D, E, I are incorrect.

But the question asks which one cannot be correct. So, I think the correct answer is I.

Wait, no, because the question is about which statement cannot be correct, meaning which is false.

So, the correct answer is the one that is false, which would be any of these, but I think the intended answer is I.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D because it's a common misconception that case studies require large samples, but that's not true.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to summarize.

The correct answer is the statement that is incorrect about case studies. So:

A: Incorrect.

B: Incorrect.

C: Incorrect.

D: Incorrect.

E: Incorrect.

I: Incorrect.

So, the question is which one of these is not correct.

But the question provides options, and we have to choose one.

Looking back, the question is about which statement cannot be correct, so the false one.

Wait, perhaps the answer is I because case studies are all about providing in-depth understanding, so saying they don't is clearly wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D because case studies don't require a large sample size.

But the question is which cannot be correct, so all of these are incorrect except F, G, H.

Wait, looking again, the options are:

A: They can be generalized. Wrong.

B: Do not use multiple sources. Wrong.

C: Always short time. Wrong.

D: Need large sample. Wrong.

E: Only psychology. Wrong.

F: Detailed examination of single case. Correct.

G: Used for attitude measurement. Maybe correct.

H: Useful as pilot studies. Correct.

I: Do not provide in-depth. Wrong.

So, the incorrect statements are A, B, C, D, E, I.

But the question is which one cannot be correct.

So, the correct answer is the statement that is incorrect about case studies.

In this case, all of A, B, C, D, E, I are incorrect. But the question asks which one cannot be correct.

Wait, perhaps the answer is I because it's the opposite of what case studies do.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D because it's a common misunderstanding.

But I'm not sure. I think I need to pick the most incorrect one.

Wait, perhaps the best way is to look for the statement that is clearly incorrect.

Option I says case studies do not provide in-depth understanding. That's the opposite of their purpose, so I is definitely incorrect.

So, the answer is I.

But wait, another thought. The question is about which statement cannot be correct, so the incorrect one.

So, the correct answer is I.

To determine which statement about case studies cannot be correct, we analyze each option based on the characteristics of case studies. Case studies are a qualitative research method that involves an in-depth examination of a single case or a small number of cases. They are exploratory, rely on multiple sources of data, and do not aim for generalization. They can span both short and long periods and typically involve small sample sizes. Case studies are used across various fields, not just psychology, and they are known for providing detailed insights into specific instances.

### Analysis of Each Option:
- **A**: Incorrect. Case studies are not based on the assumption that the case can be generalized; they focus on depth rather than breadth.
- **B**: Incorrect. Case studies often rely on multiple sources of information, such as interviews, observations, and documents.
- **C**: Incorrect. While some case studies are conducted over a short period, others, like longitudinal studies, can take years.
- **D**: Incorrect. Case studies do not require a large sample size; they typically involve a single case or a small number of cases.
- **E**: Incorrect. Case studies are used in many fields, including sociology, business, education, and more, not just psychology.
- **F**: Correct. Case studies are indeed a detailed examination of a single case or a small number of cases.
- **G**: Plausible. Case studies can be used to explore attitudes, preferences, and satisfaction, though this is not their primary focus.
- **H**: Correct. Case studies are often used as pilot studies to identify variables for further research.
- **I**: Incorrect. Case studies are specifically designed to provide in-depth understanding of a particular instance, so this statement is the opposite of their purpose.

### Conclusion:
The statement that cannot be correct is **I**, as it directly contradicts the fundamental purpose of case studies, which is to provide in-depth understanding.
