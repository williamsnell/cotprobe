Okay, so I've got this problem here about J. Robertson and Co. selling furniture to Haverson Stores for $13,560. They sent a draft dated July 10 with terms of "90 days after date" and an interest rate of 6%. Then, the draft was discounted on August 30 at a rate of 6.5% and the bank charged a collection fee of 0.1%. I need to find the proceeds. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that when a draft is used, it's like a form of payment that hasn't been realized yet. So Robertson is essentially waiting for the money, and they might discount the draft to get cash sooner. Discounting a draft means the bank takes it, gives Robertson the present value now, and collects the full amount later.

The draft is dated July 10, and the terms are "90 days after date." So the due date is October 8th (July has 31 days, so 31-10=21 days left in July, plus 30 in August, 30 in September, but wait, wait, no. Wait, 90 days from July 10. Let me calculate that properly. July 10 plus 90 days. July has 31 days, so from July 10 to July 31 is 21 days. So 90 minus 21 is 69 days remaining. August has 31 days, so 31 brings it to August 9th, and then 69-31=38 days into September. September 8th? Wait, no, because adding 38 days to August 31 would be September 7th, because August has 31 days, so August 31 plus 1 day is September 1. So 38 days would be September 7 plus 37 days? Wait, maybe I should use a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can just note that the due date is October 8, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that the draft is discounted on August 30, so I need to calculate the time from August 30 to the due date.

Wait, yes. Because the discounting happens on August 30, so the time from that date to the due date is the period we're considering. So the due date is July 10 plus 90 days. Let's compute that: July 10 plus 90 days.

July has 31 days, so from July 10 to July 31 is 21 days. Then, 90-21=69 days left. August has 31 days, so 31 days in August, bringing us to August 31. 69-31=38 days left, which would be in September. So September 7 (since 31+7=38). Wait, no, September 7 is 7 days after August 31, so 38 days would be September 8? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, 90 days from July 10 would be October 8, because July has 31 days: July 10 to July 31 is 21 days. Then August has 31, September 30, so 21+31+30=82. Wait, 90 days would be July 10 plus 90 days. Let me count: July 10 to July 31 is 21 days. Then August (31) brings it to 52 total, September (30) brings it to 82, and then October 8 is day 90. Oh wait, that's 82 days, so from October 1 to October 8 is 8 more days, so 82+8=90. So the due date is October 8.

Now, the draft is discounted on August 30. So the time from August 30 to October 8 is how many days? Let's compute that. August has 31 days, so from August 30 to August 31 is 1 day. Then all of September (30 days) and then 8 days into October. So 1 + 30 + 8 = 39 days. So the discount period is 39 days.

Wait, but in terms of discounting, the formula I remember is something like the present value is face value minus the discount. The discount is based on the interest rate and the time. But wait, the discounting bank uses their rate, which is 6.5%, and the bank also charges a collection fee of 0.1%. So I think I need to calculate two things: the discount and the collection fee.

Alternatively, perhaps the proceeds are the face value minus the discount and minus the collection fee. But wait, the collection fee is a small percentage, 0.1%, so maybe that's a flat fee based on the face value.

Wait, perhaps the process is: the bank takes the face value, subtracts the discount (which is interest for the remaining period), and also subtracts the collection fee. So the proceeds would be face value minus (discount + collection fee).

But I'm not entirely sure, so let me think. The draft is essentially a note that the bank will collect on October 8. When Robertson discounts it on August 30, the bank will give them the present value, which is the face value minus the interest that would accrue from August 30 to October 8, calculated at the bank's discount rate, plus any fees.

So the formula for the discount is: face value * discount rate * time.

Time here is 39 days. But wait, how do we express time in terms of a year? Typically, it's 360 days for such calculations unless stated otherwise, I think. So 39 days is 39/360 years.

So the discount amount would be 13,560 * (6.5/100) * (39/360). Let me compute that.

6.5% is 0.065. 39/360 is approximately 0.108333.

So 13,560 * 0.065 * 0.108333.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 13,560 * 0.065 = ?

13,560 * 0.06 = 813.6

13,560 * 0.005 = 67.8

So adding them, 813.6 + 67.8 = 881.4

Now multiply that by 0.108333 (which is 39/360). So 881.4 * 0.108333 ≈ let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute 13,560 * (0.065) * (39/360).

Compute 39/360 first: 39 ÷ 360 = 0.108333...

So 13,560 * 0.065 = 881.4

Then 881.4 * 0.108333 ≈ 881.4 * 0.1083 ≈ let's compute 881 * 0.1083.

Well, 800 * 0.1083 = 86.64

81 * 0.1083 ≈ 8.77

So total approximately 86.64 + 8.77 = 95.41

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, 881.4 * 0.108333.

Let me compute 881.4 * 0.1 = 88.14

881.4 * 0.008333 ≈ 881.4 * (1/120) ≈ 881.4 / 120 = approximately 7.345

So total discount is approximately 88.14 + 7.345 = 95.485, about $95.49.

So the discount is about $95.49.

Then, the bank charges a collection fee of 0.1% of what? I think it's of the face value. So 0.1% of $13,560 is 13,560 * 0.001 = $13.56.

So the total deductions from the face value would be the discount plus the collection fee.

So total deductions: 95.49 + 13.56 = 109.05.

Thus, the proceeds would be the face value minus deductions: 13,560 - 109.05 = 13,450.95.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe the discount is calculated differently. Wait, the draft is at 6% interest, but the discounting is at 6.5%. Wait, no, the 6% on the draft is probably the interest rate that the draft would accrue if not paid until due date. But when discounting, the bank uses their rate, which is 6.5%, so I think I did that correctly.

Wait, but perhaps the time isn't 39 days. Wait, let's recount the days from August 30 to October 8.

August 30 to August 31: 2 days (including both? Or is it 1 day? Wait, no, August 30 to August 31 is 1 day, because August 30 is day 0, August 31 is day 1.

Wait, no, perhaps better to count the days as:

From August 30 to October 8: August has 31 days, so from August 30 to August 31 is 2 days (30 and 31?), wait no, when counting days between two dates, you include both start and end dates? Or not? Let me clarify.

If today is August 30, and the due date is October 8, how many days are between August 30 and October 8, inclusive?

Wait, the period is the time the money is tied up, so from August 30 (when the bank gives the proceeds) until October 8 (when the bank gets the face value). So the number of days is (October 8 - August 30) + 1? Or not?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to compute the exact days between August 30 and October 8.

Let me compute:

August: 31 days. August 30 to August 31: 2 days (30 and 31).

September: 30 days.

October 1 to October 8: 8 days.

So total days: 2 (Aug) + 30 (Sep) + 8 (Oct) = 40 days.

Wait, that makes more sense. Because August 30 is the start, and October 8 is when the draft is due. So the time period is 40 days.

Wait, earlier I thought it was 39 days, but perhaps it's 40.

So then, 40 days is the time.

So let's recalculate with 40 days.

Time in years: 40/360 = 1/9 ≈ 0.111111.

So discount amount is 13,560 * 0.065 * (40/360).

Compute 40/360 = 1/9 ≈ 0.111111.

So 13,560 * 0.065 = 881.4 as before.

Then, 881.4 * 0.111111 ≈ let's compute 881.4 * (1/9).

881.4 ÷ 9 ≈ 97.9333.

So discount is approximately $97.93.

Then, the collection fee is 0.1% of $13,560, which is 13.56.

Total deductions: 97.93 + 13.56 = 111.49.

Proceeds: 13,560 - 111.49 = 13,448.51.

But looking at the options, none of them match this. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the discount is calculated using the 360-day year, but the formula is face value minus (face value × rate × time).

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the proceeds are calculated as face value divided by (1 + rate × time). But I don't think that's the case here because discounting is typically done by subtracting the interest.

Wait, another approach: the present value (proceeds) is equal to the face value minus the discount. The discount is calculated as face value × rate × time.

So with 40 days, the discount is 13,560 × 0.065 × (40/360).

Which is 13,560 × 0.065 × (1/9).

13,560 × 0.065 = 881.4.

881.4 × (1/9) ≈ 97.9333.

So discount is $97.93.

Proceeds before fees: 13,560 - 97.93 = 13,462.07.

Then subtract the collection fee of $13.56, so 13,462.07 - 13.56 = 13,448.51.

Hmm, but I don't see this amount in the options. So maybe my method is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the collection fee is not subtracted because it's included in the discounting. Alternatively, perhaps the collection fee is a separate charge and should be subtracted from the proceeds.

Alternatively, maybe the bank's discount already includes the collection fee, so perhaps I should compute the total discount as the sum of the interest and the fee.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the interest is calculated on the face value, and then the collection fee is also calculated on the face value, and both are subtracted from the face value to get the proceeds.

So, discount interest: 13,560 × 6.5% × (40/360) = ?

Wait, wait, no. Wait, no, the draft's interest rate is 6%, but the discounting is done at 6.5%. So the bank is using their rate, 6.5%, to compute how much to take off.

So discount is 13,560 × 6.5% × (40/360).

Which is 13,560 × 0.065 × (40/360) = let me compute that again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it as 13,560 × 0.065 × (40/360) = ?

0.065 × (40/360) = 0.065 × (1/9) ≈ 0.007222.

So 13,560 × 0.007222 ≈ 13,560 × 0.0072 = let's compute that.

13,560 × 0.007 = 94.92

13,560 × 0.000222 ≈ approx 3.

So total ≈ 94.92 + 3 = ~97.92.

So discount is about $97.92.

Then, the collection fee is 0.1% of 13,560, which is 13.56.

So total deductions are 97.92 +13.56 = 111.48.

Proceeds: 13,560 - 111.48 = 13,448.52.

Still not matching any of the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the days. Let's recount the days from August 30 to October 8.

August 30 is the starting point. So August 30 to August 31: 2 days (including both? Or is it 1 day? Because from August 30 to August 31 is 1 day, but when calculating the period from August 30 to October 8, inclusive, how many days is that?

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the days as follows:

From August 30 (day 0) to October 8 is:

August: 30 to 31 → 2 days (including 30 and 31)

September: 30 days

October: 8 days

Wait, no, because August 30 is the start, and each day after that is counted.

So from August 30 to August 31 is 1 day (because August 30 is day 0, August 31 is day 1).

Then September has 30 days, so up to September 30, that's 1 + 30 = 31 days.

Then from October 1 to October 8 is 8 days, so total is 31 + 8 = 39 days.

Wait, so that brings us back to 39 days. So the period is 39 days, not 40.

So time is 39/360 years.

So the discount is 13,560 × 0.065 × (39/360).

Compute 39/360 = 0.108333.

So 13,560 × 0.065 = 881.4.

Then 881.4 × 0.108333 ≈ 95.48.

So discount is $95.48.

Collection fee: 13,560 × 0.001 = $13.56.

Total deductions: 95.48 + 13.56 = 109.04.

Proceeds: 13,560 - 109.04 = 13,450.96.

Still not matching any options. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the collection fee is applied after the discount. Or perhaps the total is calculated differently. Alternatively, perhaps the bank takes both the discount and the collection fee as separate deductions.

Alternatively, perhaps the proceeds are calculated as face value minus discount, and then the collection fee is subtracted.

But in any case, perhaps I should compute the exact numbers.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the proceeds are calculated using the formula:

Proceeds = Face Value × (1 - (rate × time + collection fee rate))

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the discount is calculated as face value × rate × time, and the collection fee is face value × fee rate, and both are subtracted.

So, let's compute the discount as 13,560 × 0.065 × (39/360) = 13,560 × 0.065 × 0.108333.

Let me compute that more accurately.

0.065 × 0.108333 = 0.00704165.

So 13,560 × 0.00704165 = ?

Let me compute 13,560 × 0.007 = 94.92.

13,560 × 0.00004165 ≈ approx 13,560 × 0.00004 = 0.5424, and 13,560 × 0.00000165≈ ~0.0223.

So total ≈ 94.92 + 0.5424 + 0.0223 ≈ 95.4847.

So discount is approximately $95.48.

Then, collection fee is 13,560 × 0.001 = $13.56.

Total deductions: 95.48 +13.56=109.04.

Proceeds: 13,560 - 109.04=13,450.96.

But looking at the options, the closest is option D: $13,580.80, which is higher than my result.

Hmm, so perhaps I'm miscalculating the days. Let me check again.

Wait, the draft is dated July 10, terms 90 days after date, so due date is October 8.

Discounted on August 30. So the period is from August 30 to October 8.

Calculating the days between August 30 and October 8:

August: 30 to 31 → 2 days.

September: 30
