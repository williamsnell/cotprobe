Okay, so I've got this question about powerful numbers. Hmm, I remember that a powerful number is one where for every prime factor p of n, p squared also divides n. So basically, each prime factor must appear at least squared in the prime factorization of n.

Let me think about the example they gave. The options are A through G, and I need to pick which one is a powerful number.

I guess the best approach is to factor each option and check whether all the primes have exponents of at least 2.

Starting with option A: 297. Let me factor that. 297 divided by 3 is 99. 99 divided by 3 is 33, and again by 3 is 11. So 297 = 3^3 * 11^1. Oh wait, 11 is only to the first power, so that's not powerful. So A is out.

Option B: 392. Let me break it down. 392 divided by 2: 196, then 98, then 49. So that's 2^3. 49 is 7^2. So 392 = 2^3 * 7^2. Both primes (2 and 7) have exponents >=2. So B looks good so far, but I should check the others to make sure.

Option C: 300. 300 is 3 * 100. 100 is 2^2 *5^2. So 300 = 2^2 * 3^1 *5^2. Oh wait, 3 is only to the first power. So not powerful. So C is out.

Option D: 240. Let's see, 240 is 16*15. 16 is 2^4, 15 is 3*5. So 240 = 2^4 *3^1 *5^1. Both 3 and 5 have exponents 1, which is less than 2. So D isn't powerful.

Option E: 336. Let me factor this. 336 divided by 2 is 168, again 84, 42, 21. So 2^4. 21 is 3*7. So 336=2^4 *3^1 *7^1. Both 3 and 7 are to the first power. So E is not powerful.

Option F: 360. Factoring, 360 = 36*10. 36 is 6^2=2^2*3^2. 10 is 2*5. So 360=2^3 *3^2 *5^1. Oh wait, 5 is only once, so not powerful. So F is out.

Option G: 408. Let's factor this. 408 divided by 2 is 204, again 102, again 51. So 2^3. 51 is 3*17. So 408=2^3 *3^1 *17^1. Both 3 and 17 have exponents 1. So not powerful.

So the only option that was powerful is B: 392. Let me just double-check. B's factors are 2^3 and 7^2. Both exponents are 2 or higher. Yep, that's correct.

To determine which of the given numbers is a "powerful" number, we need to check if, for every prime factor \( p \) of \( n \), \( p^2 \) also divides \( n \). This means that in the prime factorization of \( n \), every prime must have an exponent of at least 2.

Let's analyze each option:

- **A: 297**  
  \( 297 = 3^3 \times 11^1 \)  
  The prime factor 11 has an exponent of 1, which is less than 2. Therefore, 297 is not a powerful number.

- **B: 392**  
  \( 392 = 2^3 \times 7^2 \)  
  Both prime factors (2 and 7) have exponents of at least 2. Therefore, 392 is a powerful number.

- **C: 300**  
  \( 300 = 2^2 \times 3^1 \times 5^2 \)  
  The prime factor 3 has an exponent of 1, which is less than 2. Therefore, 300 is not a powerful number.

- **D: 240**  
  \( 240 = 2^4 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \)  
  Both prime factors 3 and 5 have exponents of 1, which is less than 2. Therefore, 240 is not a powerful number.

- **E: 336**  
  \( 336 = 2^4 \times 3^1 \times 7^1 \)  
  Both prime factors 3 and 7 have exponents of 1, which is less than 2. Therefore, 336 is not a powerful number.

- **F: 360**  
  \( 360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5^1 \)  
  The prime factor 5 has an exponent of 1, which is less than 2. Therefore, 360 is not a powerful number.

- **G: 408**  
  \( 408 = 2^3 \times 3^1 \times 17^1 \)  
  Both prime factors 3 and 17 have exponents of 1, which is less than 2. Therefore, 408 is not a powerful number.

The only number that satisfies the condition of being a powerful number is **B: 392**.

Answer: B
