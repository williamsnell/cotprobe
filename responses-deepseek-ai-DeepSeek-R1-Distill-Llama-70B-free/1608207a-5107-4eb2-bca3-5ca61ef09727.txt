Okay, so I've got this problem from the Harris foundry about their daily manufacturing costs. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem gives me the cost equation: C = 3m² + m + 9, where C is the cost in dollars and m is the number of pieces produced. The first part (i) asks how many pieces have been produced by lunch hour (12 noon), given that the cost by 9:00 am is $4,849. They also mention that the rate after 9 am is 10 pieces per hour. Oh, and there's a hint to use the quadratic formula, so I'll probably need to solve a quadratic equation.

Alright, let's tackle part (i) first. I need to find the number of pieces produced by 12 noon. Since it's 9 am when the cost is $4,849, that means by 9 am, they've already made some pieces. Let me denote the number of pieces produced by 9 am as m. 

So, plugging into the cost equation:
C = 3m² + m + 9
We know C is 4849, so:
4849 = 3m² + m + 9

Hmm, let me rearrange this into standard quadratic form:
3m² + m + 9 - 4849 = 0
3m² + m - 4840 = 0

Wait, 4849 minus 9 is 4840? Let me check: 9 subtracted from 4849 is 4840, yes. So the equation is 3m² + m - 4840 = 0.

Now, using the quadratic formula. The quadratic is in the form ax² + bx + c = 0, so a=3, b=1, c=-4840.

The formula is m = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)] / (2a)

Plugging in the values:
Discriminant D = b² -4ac = (1)² -4*(3)*(-4840)
= 1 + 4*3*4840
Wait, because 4ac is 4*3*(-4840) which is negative, so subtracting that makes it addition.

Calculating 4*3=12. Then 12 * 4840. Let me compute that.

4840 * 12: 4000*12=48,000, 800*12=9,600, 40*12=480. So 48,000 + 9,600 = 57,600 + 480= 58,080. So D = 1 +58,080 =58,081.

Now what's the square root of 58,081? Hmm, I'm not sure off the top of my head, but let me think. 241 squared is 58,081 because 240² is 57,600, so 241²=57,600 + 480 +1=58,081. So sqrt(58081)=241.

So m = [-1 ±241]/(2*3) → denominator is 6.

We have two solutions:

m = (-1 +241)/6 = 240/6=40

m = (-1-241)/6 = (-242)/6 ≈ -40.333...

But the number of pieces can't be negative, so m=40. So by 9 am, they've made 40 pieces.

Wait, but the question is asking how many pieces by 12 noon. So from 9 am to 12 noon is 3 hours. And the production rate after 9 am is 10 pieces per hour. So in 3 hours, they'll make 10*3=30 pieces.

So total by noon is 40 +30=70 pieces.

Wait, but wait a second. The cost given is for the work produced by 9 am, which is the 40 pieces. So after that, they make 30 more. So total is 70 pieces by noon.

Looking at the options, option F is 70 pieces. So that's probably the answer for part (i).

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors.

So quadratic equation: 3m² +m -4840=0. a=3, b=1, c=-4840.

Discriminant: 1 + 4*3*4840 = 1 + 12*4840.

12 * 4840: Let me compute 10*4840=48,400, 2*4840=9,680. Total is 58,080. So 1 +58,080=58,081. sqrt of that is 241. So m=( -1 +241 )/6=240/6=40. That's correct.

So yes, 40 by 9 am, then 30 more by noon. So 70 total. So answer (i) is F.

Part (ii) asks to express the total cost as a function of t, where t is the number of hours past 9 am.

So, let's think. By 9 am, they have produced 40 pieces. After that, every hour they produce 10 pieces. So at time t hours after 9 am, the total number of pieces made is 40 +10t.

But wait, wait. Wait, the total pieces produced by 9 am is m=40. Then, after 9 am, they make 10t pieces. So the total m at time t (t hours after 9) is m = 40 +10t.

But wait, the cost function is given as C =3m² +m +9. So substituting m in terms of t.

So C(t) =3*(40 +10t)^2 + (40 +10t) +9.

Let me expand that:

First, expand (40 +10t)^2: 40² + 2*40*10t + (10t)^2 = 1600 + 800t +100t².

Multiply by 3: 3*1600=4800, 3*800t=2400t, 3*100t²=300t² → 300t² +2400t +4800.

Then add (40 +10t): 40 +10t.

Add 9: +9.

So putting it all together:

C(t) = 300t² +2400t +4800 +40 +10t +9.

Combine like terms:

300t² + (2400t +10t) + (4800 +40 +9).

So 300t² +2410t +4849.

Wait, let me add the constants: 4800 +40=4840 +9=4849. And the t terms:2400+10=2410.

So C(t)=300t² +2410t +4849.

Wait, but let me make sure. At t=0 (9 am), C should be $4849. Plugging t=0: 0 +0 +4849=4849. Correct.

And then, for example, at t=3 (noon), m=70. So C(3) =300*(9) +2410*(3) +4849 → 2700 +7230 +4849.

Adding 2700+7230=9930 +4849=14779.

Alternatively, using the cost formula with m=70: C=3*(70)^2 +70 +9.

70²=4900 → 3*4900=14700; 14700 +70=14770; +9=14779. So matches with the function. So that's correct.

So the function is C(t)=300t² +2410t +4849.

Wait, but the problem only asks for part (ii), which is to express C as a function of t. So the answer would be C(t) =300 t² +2410 t +4849.

But I'm not sure if the options include this part. The given options are for part (i), so the answer to (i) is 70 pieces, which is option F.

To solve the problem, we start with the cost equation provided: 

\[
C = 3m^2 + m + 9
\]

where \(C\) is the total cost in dollars and \(m\) is the number of pieces produced. 

### Part (i): Pieces produced by 12 noon
By 9:00 am, the cost is $4,849. Substituting \(C = 4849\) into the equation:

\[
4849 = 3m^2 + m + 9
\]

Rearranging into standard quadratic form:

\[
3m^2 + m - 4840 = 0
\]

Using the quadratic formula:

\[
m = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

where \(a = 3\), \(b = 1\), and \(c = -4840\). First, calculate the discriminant:

\[
b^2 - 4ac = 1^2 - 4(3)(-4840) = 1 + 58080 = 58081
\]

The square root of 58081 is 241. Substituting back:

\[
m = \frac{-1 \pm 241}{6}
\]

This gives two solutions:

\[
m = \frac{-1 + 241}{6} = 40 \quad \text{and} \quad m = \frac{-1 - 241}{6} \approx -40.333
\]

Since the number of pieces cannot be negative, \(m = 40\). This means 40 pieces were produced by 9:00 am. 

The production rate after 9:00 am is 10 pieces per hour. From 9:00 am to 12:00 noon is 3 hours, so an additional:

\[
10 \times 3 = 30 \, \text{pieces}
\]

are produced. Therefore, the total number of pieces produced by 12:00 noon is:

\[
40 + 30 = 70 \, \text{pieces}
\]

### Part (ii): Total cost as a function of \(t\)
Let \(t\) represent the number of hours past 9:00 am. The total number of pieces produced by time \(t\) is:

\[
m = 40 + 10t
\]

Substitute \(m = 40 + 10t\) into the cost equation:

\[
C(t) = 3(40 + 10t)^2 + (40 + 10t) + 9
\]

Expanding \((40 + 10t)^2\):

\[
(40 + 10t)^2 = 40^2 + 2(40)(10t) + (10t)^2 = 1600 + 800t + 100t^2
\]

Multiply by 3:

\[
3(1600 + 800t + 100t^2) = 4800 + 2400t + 300t^2
\]

Add the remaining terms:

\[
C(t) = 4800 + 2400t + 300t^2 + 40 + 10t + 9
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
C(t) = 300t^2 + 2410t + 4849
\]

Thus, the total cost as a function of \(t\) is:

\[
C(t) = 300t^2 + 2410t + 4849
\]

### Final Answer
(i) The number of pieces produced by 12:00 noon is **70 pieces**.  
(ii) The total cost as a function of \(t\) is \(C(t) = 300t^2 + 2410t + 4849\).  

The correct answer for part (i) is **F**.
