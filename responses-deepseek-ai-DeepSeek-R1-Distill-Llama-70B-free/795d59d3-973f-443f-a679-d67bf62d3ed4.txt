Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is asking for the value of (2/π) multiplied by an infinite product. The product is from k=1 to infinity of (2k)^2 divided by (2k-1)(2k+1). Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that infinite products sometimes relate to known mathematical constants or functions. The presence of π makes me think this might be connected to some trigonometric functions or maybe the Wallis product formula. Oh wait, Wallis! I think Wallis' formula for π involves an infinite product. Let me recall what that formula is.

Wallis' formula states that π/2 is equal to the product from n=1 to infinity of (2n)^2 / [(2n-1)(2n+1)]. Wait, that looks exactly like the product in the problem here. So, the product given is the same as the Wallis product for π/2. So the product equals π/2.

But wait, the problem here is (2/π) multiplied by this product. If the product is π/2, then substituting that in, we get (2/π) * (π/2). Let's compute that. The π in the numerator and denominator would cancel out, and 2 divided by 2 is 1. So the entire expression would be 1.

Wait a minute, but let me double-check. Wallis' product is π/2 equals the product starting at n=1 of (4n²)/( (2n-1)(2n+1) ). So yes, that's correct. So multiplying (2/π) by (π/2) gives 1. So the answer should be 1.0. Looking at the options, option F is 1.0.

But just to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me think again. Another way to approach this is to write out a few terms of the product and see if it simplifies.

The product is ∏_{k=1}^∞ (2k)^2 / [(2k-1)(2k+1)]. Let's write the first few terms:

For k=1: (2*1)^2 / (1 * 3) = 4/(1*3) = 4/3

k=2: (4)^2/(3*5) = 16/15

k=3: (6)^2/(5*7)=36/35

So the product is (4/3) * (16/15) * (36/35) * ... 

Wait, that's the same as (4/3) * (16/15) * (36/35) etc. I remember that the Wallis product is indeed this, which equals π/2. So the product is π/2.

So when I multiply that by 2/π, it's (2/π) * (π/2) = 1. So yes, the answer is 1.0, which is option F.

The problem asks for the value of \( \frac{2}{\pi} \prod_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{(2k)^2}{(2k-1)(2k+1)} \). To solve this, we recognize that the infinite product resembles Wallis' formula for \( \frac{\pi}{2} \), which is given by:

\[
\frac{\pi}{2} = \prod_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{(2k)^2}{(2k-1)(2k+1)}.
\]

Thus, the infinite product in the problem is equal to \( \frac{\pi}{2} \). Substituting this into the expression, we have:

\[
\frac{2}{\pi} \cdot \frac{\pi}{2} = 1.
\]

Therefore, the value of the given expression is \( 1.0 \). Among the provided options, the correct answer is:

F: 1.0.
