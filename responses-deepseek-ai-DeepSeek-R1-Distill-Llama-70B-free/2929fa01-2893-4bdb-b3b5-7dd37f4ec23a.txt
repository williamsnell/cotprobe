Okay, so I have this problem about oil flowing through a pipe, and I need to calculate some properties like average velocity, power, and shear stress at a specific point. Hmm, let me think about where to start. 

First, the given data: the oil's viscosity is 0.2248 lbm/(ft·s). The pipe is horizontal with an inside diameter of 4 inches. The pressure drop is 24,000 lbf/ft² per mile of flow. I need to find the average velocity, the power required, and then the velocity and shear stress at a point 3/2 inches from the center.

Wait, units might be tricky here. I should convert everything to consistent units. Let's see, the diameter is 4 inches, so radius is 2 inches, which is 2/12 = 1/6 feet, or about 0.1667 feet. The pressure drop is given per mile, so maybe I should convert that to per foot for easier calculations.

I remember that for pipe flow, especially when pressure drop is given, Poiseuille's law might be applicable. Poiseuille's equation relates the flow rate to the pressure gradient and viscosity. The formula is something like Q = (π r^4 ΔP) / (8 η L), where Q is the flow rate, r is radius, ΔP is pressure drop, η is viscosity, and L is the length of the pipe. 

Wait, but I'm looking for the average velocity. Oh right, the average velocity V_avg is equal to the flow rate Q divided by the cross-sectional area A. The area A is π r². So combining these, V_avg = (Q)/(π r²) = (π r^4 ΔP)/(8 η L) / (π r²) ) = (r² ΔP) / (8 η L). So V_avg = (r² ΔP) / (8 η L). 

Wait, wait, but I need to make sure all the units are consistent. Let's list out the given values:

Viscosity η = 0.2248 lbm/(ft·s)
Pressure drop ΔP = 24,000 lbf/ft² per mile. So per foot, that's 24,000 / 5280 (since 1 mile is 5280 feet). Let me calculate that. 24,000 /5280 = let's see, 5280*4=21120, so 24,000-21120=1280. 1280/5280 = 0.2424. Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, no. Actually, ΔP is 24,000 per mile, so per foot, ΔP would be 24,000 / 5280 lbf/ft² per foot. Let me calculate that. 24,000 divided by 5280. 5280 is 5.28e3, so 2.4e4 /5.28e3 = approx 4.545 lb/ft² per foot. Wait, 24,000 /5280 is 24,000 ÷ 5280. Let me compute that step by step: 5280 * 4 = 21120. 24,000 -21120= 2880. 2880/5280= 0.545... So 4.545 lb/ft² per foot.

Wait, no, wait. The pressure drop is 24,000 lbf/ft² per mile. So for a length L of one mile, the pressure drop is 24,000 lb/ft². So for a pipe of length L (1 mile), ΔP is 24,000. But when using the formula, I need ΔP per unit length (like per foot), or use L in feet. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to compute using L in feet and ΔP as per foot.

Wait, the formula for V_avg is (r² ΔP) / (8 η L). Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Let me rederive it.

The flow rate Q is given by Poiseuille's law as Q = (π r^4 ΔP) / (8 η L). Then average velocity V_avg is Q/A, and A is π r². So V_avg = Q/(π r²) = [ (π r^4 ΔP)/(8 η L) ) ] / (π r² ) ) = (r² ΔP) / (8 η L ). So yes, that's correct.

So, V_avg = (r^2 * ΔP) / (8 η L )

But wait, ΔP is the pressure drop across the length L. So for L in feet and ΔP in lbf/ft², the units should work out. Let me check the units.

r is in feet, ΔP is lb/ft², η is lbm/(ft s), and L is in feet.

So numerator is (ft^2) * (lb/ft²) ) → lb ft²/(ft²) → lb ft^0 * ft²/ft²? Wait, perhaps better to compute the units of V_avg expression.

[r^2] = ft², [ΔP]= lb/ft², [η]= lbm/(ft s), [L]= ft.

So (r² ΔP)/(8 η L ) → (ft² * lb/ft²) ) / ( (lbm/(ft s)) * ft )

Simplify numerator: lb.

Denominator: (lbm/(ft s)) * ft → (lbm/s).

So overall units: (lb) / (lbm/s) ) → lb s / lbm. But 1 lb = 1 lbm * g_c, where g_c is the conversion factor (32.174 lbm ft/(lbf s²)). Wait, but this might get complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps using the conversion factor to get units correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute V_avg as (r^2 * ΔP) / (8 η L )

But let's plug in the numbers. Let me compute each term.

r = 4 inches / 2 = 2 inches = 2/12 ft = 1/6 ft ≈ 0.1666667 ft.

ΔP is 24,000 lb/ft² per mile. So for L = 1 mile = 5280 ft.

So, when I plug into V_avg:

V_avg = ( (0.1666667 ft)^2 * 24000 lb/ft² ) / (8 * 0.2248 lbm/(ft s) * 5280 ft )

Wait, let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: (0.1666667)^2 = approx 0.0277778 ft². Multiply by 24,000 lb/ft²: 0.0277778 * 24,000 = 666.666 lb.

Denominator: 8 * 0.2248 = 1.7984. Multiply by 5280 ft: 1.7984 * 5280 ≈ let's see, 5280 * 1.8 ≈ 9504, so 5280 * 1.7984 ≈ 5280*(1.8 - 0.0016)= 9504 - 5280*0.0016. 5280 * 0.0016 = 8.448. So 9504 -8.448≈9495.552. So denominator is 9495.552 lbm/(ft s) * ft → lbm/s? Because 1 ft/s is in the denominator from η.

Wait, no, η has units lbm/(ft s). So denominator becomes (8 η L) → (lbm/(ft s)) * ft → lbm/s.

So overall, V_avg = 666.666 lb / (9495.552 lbm/s )

Wait, but lb and lbm are different units. I need to account for the conversion between lb force and lb mass. So 1 lb force equals 1 lbm * g_c, where g_c is 32.174 lbm-ft/(lbf-s²).

So to convert lb to lbm, I divide by g_c. Because 1 lb = 1 lbm * g_c / 1 ft/s² → so 1 lb = 0.031081 lbm.

Wait, perhaps I should express V_avg as (r² ΔP)/(8 η L) and include the conversion factor.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to adjust the formula to account for unit conversion.

Alternatively, perhaps I should convert the pressure drop into a different unit.

Wait, another approach: the formula for average velocity when pressure drop is known is:

V_avg = ( (r^2) * (ΔP) ) / (8 * η * L )

But I need to make sure all units are consistent. Since η is in lbm/(ft·s), ΔP is in lb/ft², and L is in ft.

Wait, perhaps I should use the unit conversion factor to handle the lb to lbm.

Let me think: 1 lbf = (1 lbm) * g_c, where g_c is 32.174 lbm·ft/(lbf·s²). So when I have lb force, I can express it in terms of lb mass by dividing by g_c.

So the numerator is (r^2 * ΔP) → (ft^2) * (lb/ft²) → lb. To convert this to lbm, I multiply by (1 lbm)/(g_c lbf), so lb * (1 lbm)/(g_c lbf) ) = lbm/(g_c).

So V_avg = (r^2 ΔP) / (8 η L ) → (lbm/(g_c)) / ( (lbm/(ft·s)) * ft )

Wait, let's write that out.

V_avg = [ (r^2 * ΔP) / (8 η L) ) ] * (1/g_c )

Because ΔP is in lb/ft², and η is in lbm/(ft·s), so the units become:

[ (ft^2) * (lb/ft^2) ) ] → lb.

Then, divide by [ (lbm/(ft s)) * ft ) ] → (lbm/s )

So lb / (lbm/s) → (lb s)/lbm → (s * lb ) / lbm.

But since 1 lb = (1 lbm) * g_c, then (lb s) / lbm = g_c s.

So the unit for V_avg is g_c ft/s, but wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, I should include the conversion factor in the formula.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to use the formula with the conversion factor included.

So the formula for average velocity is:

V_avg = ( (r^2) * ΔP ) / (8 * η * L ) * (1/g_c )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should look up the correct formula with unit conversion.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula already accounts for the unit conversion, so maybe I should proceed.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate V_avg as (r² ΔP)/(8 η L) and then see what the units are.

Wait, r is in feet, ΔP in lb/ft², η in lbm/(ft s), L in ft.

So:

r² → (ft)^2.

ΔP → lb/ft².

So numerator: (ft)^2 * (lb/ft²) = lb·ft² / ft² → lb.

Denominator: 8 * η (lbm/(ft s)) * L (ft) → 8 * η * L → (lbm/(ft s)) * ft → lbm/(s).

So overall, V_avg = (lb) / (lbm/s) ) → (lb s)/lbm.

Now, 1 lb = 0.031081 lbm (approx), so (lb s)/lbm = 0.031081 s^{-1}.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Hmm, perhaps I need to include the conversion factor g_c.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should use the formula V_avg = ( (r²) (ΔP) ) / (8 η L ) * (1/g_c )

Because 1 lb = g_c lbm·ft/(s²). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for V_avg as (r² ΔP) / (8 η L ) * (1/g_c )

Let me compute it numerically.

Compute numerator:

r = 0.1666667 ft.

r² = (0.1666667)^2 = 0.0277778 ft².

ΔP = 24,000 lb/ft² (since for L = 5280 ft, the ΔP is 24,000 lb/ft²).

Wait, no! Wait, L is 1 mile = 5280 ft, and ΔP is 24,000 lb/ft². So for the entire mile, the pressure drop is 24,000 lb/ft².

So the formula is:

V_avg = (r² ΔP) / (8 η L )

Plugging the numbers:

r² = 0.0277778 ft².

ΔP = 24,000 lb/ft².

η = 0.2248 lbm/(ft s).

L = 5280 ft.

So numerator: 0.0277778 * 24,000 = 0.0277778 *24,000 = 666.666 lb.

Denominator: 8 * 0.2248 * 5280.

Compute 8 * 0.2248 = 1.7984.

1.7984 * 5280 = Let's compute 1.8 *5280 = 9504, then 0.9984*(5280) = 0.9984 *5280 ≈ 5272.32.

Wait, actually, perhaps it's better to compute 1.7984 * 5280:

= (1 + 0.7984) * 5280 = 5280 + 0.7984*5280.

0.7984 *5280: 0.7 *5280 = 3696, 0.0984*5280≈ 519.  So total ≈ 3696 +519=4215.

So 5280 +4215=9495. So denominator is 9495. Then, 666.666 /9495 ≈ 0.0703 lb/(lbm/ft s * ft )? Wait, units again are confusing me.

Wait, perhaps I should include the conversion factor g_c. So V_avg = 666.666 lb / (9495 lbm/(ft s) * ft ) → 666.666 lb / (9495 lbm/s )

But to convert lb to lbm, since 1 lb = 0.031081 lbm (because F=ma, 1 lbf = (1 lbm)(g), so 1 lbm = 1 lbf / g → so 1 lbf = g lbm ). Wait, perhaps it's better to use g_c where 1 lbm = 1 lbf / g_c, so 1 lbf = g_c lbm.

Wait, g is 32.2 ft/s², so g_c is 32.2 lbm·ft/(lbf·s²). So 1 lbf = 1 lbm * g_c / 1 ft/s² → so 1 lb = g_c lbm.

Wait, no, perhaps the correct approach is that 1 lb force equals (1 lbm * g), so 1 lbm = 1 lb / g_c, where g_c is 32.2 lbm·ft/(lbf·s²). So to convert lb to lbm, you divide by g_c.

So V_avg in lbm/(ft s) would be (666.666 lb) / (9495 lbm/s) ) * (1 lbm / (g_c lbf) ). Wait, this is getting a bit messy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate V_avg as (r² ΔP) / (8 η L ) and then adjust for the units.

Wait, perhaps the formula can be written with the conversion factor included. Let me look for a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for power. The power required is the pressure drop multiplied by the flow rate.

Power P = ΔP * Q * (1/g_c )

Because ΔP is in lb/ft², Q is in ft³/s, so ΔP*Q is (lb/ft²)*(ft³/s) )= lb ft/s. To convert to horsepower, since 1 hp = 550 ft·lb/s, so:

P = (ΔP * Q ) / (550 g_c )

Wait, maybe I'm complicating things. Let me try to compute V_avg first.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula when using lb units is:

V_avg = ( (r^2) (ΔP) ) / (8 η L ) * (1/g_c )

Because the pressure is in lb/ft², which is force per area, and η is in lbm/(ft s). So using g_c to convert units.

So, V_avg = (0.0277778 * 24000) / (8 * 0.2248 * 5280 ) ) * (1/32.174 )

Compute numerator of the first fraction: 0.0277778 *24,000 = 666.666 lb.

Denominator of first fraction: 8 *0.2248 *5280 = 8 *0.2248=1.7984; 1.7984 *5280=9495.552.

So first fraction: 666.666 /9495.552 ≈ 0.0703.

Then multiply by 1/32.174: 0.0703 /32.174 ≈ 0.00218 ft/s? That can't be right; the options are in the 1.8-3.0 ft/s range. So I must have made a mistake in including the conversion factor.

Hmm, maybe I shouldn't include the conversion factor because the formula already accounts for it. Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: use the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, which is for laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid in a circular pipe.

The equation is:

Q = (π r^4 ΔP) / (8 η L )

Average velocity V_avg = Q / (π r²) = (r² ΔP) / (8 η L )

But to make sure units are consistent. Let me check units again.

r in ft.

ΔP in lbf/ft².

η in lbm/(ft s).

L in ft.

So, r² [ft²], ΔP [lbf/ft²], η [lbm/(ft s)], L [ft].

So numerator: ft² * lbf/ft² → lbf.

Denominator: 8 * η [lbm/(ft s
