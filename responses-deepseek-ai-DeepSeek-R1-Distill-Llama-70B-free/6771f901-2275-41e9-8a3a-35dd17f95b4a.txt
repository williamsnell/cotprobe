Question:

Toxicity and dose-response data from animal studies, together with data of which of the following types, are used to evaluate the safety of a food substance?


Options:

A: The price of the food to which the substance is added
B: The concentration of the substance in food
C: The amount of the substance that is excreted by the human body
D: The amount of the substance that is naturally present in the human body
E: The quantity of the substance sold in supermarkets
F: The yearly intake of the substance by animals consuming the food
G: The daily intake of the substance by humans consuming the food
H: The total amount of the substance a person will consume over a lifetime

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about evaluating the safety of a food substance. Hmm, I remember that when assessing safety, especially for food additives or substances, there are some key factors considered. The question mentions toxicity and dose-response data from animal studies, so I'm thinking about what other data points are necessary.

Wait, right, animal studies give us information on how toxic a substance is and how the effects vary with the dose. But to apply that to humans, we need more data. I think it's about exposure levels, like how much of the substance people actually consume.

So the options are A through H. Let's go through them. Option A is the price of the foodâ€”doesn't seem relevant. Price wouldn't affect safety assessment. Option B is the concentration in food. That makes more sense because if you know how concentrated it is, you can calculate intake. But wait, maybe it's about the actual intake, not just concentration.

Option C is about excretion by the human body. Excretion rates are part of pharmacokinetics, which might be considered, but I'm not sure if that's the primary factor here. Option D is the natural presence in the body. I don't think that's directly used in safety evaluation for food additives unless it's something naturally occurring. But the question is about added substances, perhaps.

Option E is quantity sold in supermarkets. That seems more related to market data than safety. Option F is yearly intake by animals consuming the food. Wait, but the question is about human safety, so animal intake data might not directly apply. Unless it's for estimating, but I'm not certain.

Option G is daily intake of the substance by humans. Oh, that rings a bell. I remember something about estimating the daily intake to compare with the safe levels determined from animal studies. Like, if you know the acceptable daily intake from animal data, you need to know how much humans are actually consuming each day to ensure it's below that level.

Option H is the total lifetime consumption. While that's a consideration for chronic effects, the immediate concern is usually the daily exposure because toxins often have thresholds, and acute vs chronic effects matter. But I think for safety evaluation, both daily and lifetime might be factors. But the question asks which data type is used together with animal toxicity data.

So putting it all together, the toxicity data from animals tells you the dose where effects occur. To assess safety for humans, you need to know how much humans are exposed to. So you'd calculate the expected daily intake (like from food consumption surveys and concentration in food) and compare it to the safe levels from animal studies.

So the correct answer is probably G: The daily intake of the substance by humans consuming the food.

To evaluate the safety of a food substance, toxicity and dose-response data from animal studies are combined with human exposure data. Among the options provided, the daily intake of the substance by humans consuming the food (Option G) is the most relevant. This is because knowing the actual amount of the substance humans consume daily allows for a direct comparison with the safe levels determined from animal studies, ensuring that human exposure remains below harmful thresholds.

Answer: G
