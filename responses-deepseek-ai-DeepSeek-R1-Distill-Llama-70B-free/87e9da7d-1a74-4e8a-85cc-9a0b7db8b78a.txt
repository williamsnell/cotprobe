Okay, so I've got this integral to solve: the integral from 2 to 4 of [sqrt(log(9 - x)) / (sqrt(log(9 - x)) + sqrt(log(x + 3)))] dx. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Let me try to break it down.

First, I notice the integrand has square roots of logarithms in both the numerator and denominator. The denominator is the sum of two square roots, one involving (9 - x) and the other (x + 3). Maybe there's a substitution or some symmetry I can exploit here.

Wait, the limits of integration are from 2 to 4. Let me think about the substitution u = 6 - x. Because if I substitute u, then when x is 2, u becomes 4, and when x is 4, u becomes 2. So the limits would switch, but maybe the integral will look similar.

Let me try that substitution. Let u = 6 - x. Then, du = -dx. So when x = 2, u = 4; x=4, u=2. So the integral becomes the integral from u=4 to u=2 of [sqrt(log(9 - (6 - u)))] / [sqrt(log(9 - (6 - u))) + sqrt(log((6 - u) + 3)))] * (-du). Oh wait, I can switch the limits and get rid of the negative sign. So it becomes the integral from 2 to 4 of [sqrt(log(3 + u))] / [sqrt(log(3 + u)) + sqrt(log(9 - u)))] du.

Wait a minute, because 9 - (6 - u) is 3 + u. And (6 - u) +3 is 9 - u. So the numerator in terms of u is sqrt(log(3 + u)), and the denominator is sqrt(log(3 + u)) + sqrt(log(9 - u)).

Wait, but the original integral had sqrt(log(9 - x)) in the numerator and sqrt(log(x+3)) in the denominator. So after substitution, the numerator is sqrt(log(3 + u)), which is the same as sqrt(log(u + 3)), and the denominator is the same as before but the terms are swapped.

So the original integral, let's call it I, is equal to the integral from 2 to 4 of [sqrt(log(9 - x))] / [sqrt(log(9 - x)) + sqrt(log(x+3))] dx.

After substitution, it becomes the integral from 2 to 4 of [sqrt(log(u + 3))] / [sqrt(log(u +3)) + sqrt(log(9 - u))] du.

But wait, the denominator is the same as the original denominator. Because sqrt(log(9 - u)) is the same as sqrt(log(9 - (6 - x))), but that's going back. Alternatively, in terms of u, the denominator is [sqrt(log(u +3)) + sqrt(log(9 - u))].

So I've expressed I in terms of u, but I is also equal to the integral from 2 to 4 of [sqrt(log(u + 3))] / [sqrt(log(u +3)) + sqrt(log(9 - u))] du.

Now, let's call the original integral I. So I = ∫[2→4] [sqrt(log(9 - x))]/[sqrt(log(9 -x)) + sqrt(log(x+3))] dx.

But after substitution, I also equals ∫[2→4] [sqrt(log(u +3))]/[sqrt(log(u+3)) + sqrt(log(9 - u))] du.

Wait, but u is just a dummy variable. So I can write I = ∫[2→4] [sqrt(log(x +3))]/[sqrt(log(x+3)) + sqrt(log(9 -x))] dx.

Because u can be replaced with x again. So now I have two expressions for I:

I = ∫[2→4] [sqrt(log(9 -x))]/[sqrt(log(9 -x)) + sqrt(log(x+3))] dx.

And I = ∫[2→4] [sqrt(log(x+3))]/[sqrt(log(x+3)) + sqrt(log(9 -x))] dx.

If I add these two expressions together, I get:

I + I = ∫[2→4] [sqrt(log(9 -x)) + sqrt(log(x+3))]/[sqrt(log(9 -x)) + sqrt(log(x+3))] dx.

Because the denominators are the same, and the numerators add up to sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). So the fraction becomes 1.

So 2I = ∫[2→4] 1 dx. Because the numerator and denominator are the same, so the fraction is 1.

The integral of 1 from 2 to 4 is just (4-2) = 2. So 2I = 2 → I = 1.

Wait, but looking at the options, option G is 1.0.

So the answer should be G.

To evaluate the integral 

\[
\int_2^4 \frac{\sqrt{\log(9-x)}}{\sqrt{\log(9-x)}+\sqrt{\log(x+3)}} \, dx,
\]

we start by making the substitution \( u = 6 - x \). This gives \( du = -dx \), and the limits of integration change as follows: when \( x = 2 \), \( u = 4 \), and when \( x = 4 \), \( u = 2 \). Switching the limits to eliminate the negative sign, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_2^4 \frac{\sqrt{\log(3+u)}}{\sqrt{\log(3+u)}+\sqrt{\log(9-u)}} \, du.
\]

This shows that the integral remains the same under the substitution \( u = 6 - x \). Denoting the original integral as \( I \), we now have two expressions for \( I \):

\[
I = \int_2^4 \frac{\sqrt{\log(9-x)}}{\sqrt{\log(9-x)}+\sqrt{\log(x+3)}} \, dx,
\]
\[
I = \int_2^4 \frac{\sqrt{\log(x+3)}}{\sqrt{\log(9-x)}+\sqrt{\log(x+3)}} \, dx.
\]

Adding these two expressions, we get:

\[
I + I = \int_2^4 \frac{\sqrt{\log(9-x)} + \sqrt{\log(x+3)}}{\sqrt{\log(9-x)} + \sqrt{\log(x+3)}} \, dx.
\]

The numerator and denominator in the integrand are identical, so the fraction simplifies to 1. Thus:

\[
2I = \int_2^4 1 \, dx.
\]

The integral of 1 over the interval \([2, 4]\) is simply the length of the interval:

\[
2I = 4 - 2 = 2.
\]

Solving for \( I \), we find:

\[
I = 1.
\]

Thus, the value of the integral is 1.0, which corresponds to option G.
