Alright, so I've got this problem about spur gears. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Okay, the problem says a pair of mating spur gears increases the speed by about 4 times. Hmm, wait, speed ratio is the inverse of the velocity ratio, right? Or is it the other way around? Let me think. Oh wait, velocity ratio is the ratio of the driver gear to the driven gear in terms of rotational speed. So if the speed increases by 4 times, that means the velocity ratio (V_R) is probably around 4. But wait, maybe it's the other way. Because if the driver is faster, then the driven would be slower, right? Like, for example, if gear A is driving gear B, and if gear A has more teeth, then it turns slower, making gear B turn faster. So the speed increases when the driven gear has fewer teeth. So the velocity ratio would be the ratio of the driver's teeth to the driven's teeth. So if the speed increases by 4 times, that would mean the velocity ratio is 4. Because the driven gear is spinning 4 times faster than the driver.

But wait, the question says "increases the speed of the shaft by approximately 4 times." Oh wait, maybe I'm confusing it. Let me define it clearly. Velocity ratio (V_R) is the ratio of the speed of the driver to the speed of the driven. So if the speed increases, the driven is moving faster. So if the driver is connected to a motor spinning at a certain RPM, the driven would spin faster. So V_R would be (speed of driver) / (speed of driven) = 1/4. Because if driven is 4 times faster, then V_R is 0.25. But wait, that contradicts. Hmm, maybe I have it backwards. Let me check: in gear terms, the velocity ratio is usually the ratio of the input speed to the output speed. So if the output speed is higher, the ratio is less than one. But the problem states that the speed increases by 4 times, meaning the output is 4 times the input. So V_R would be input over output, which is 1/4. But that doesn't make sense because the options are all greater than 1. Wait no, looking at the options, some have V_R greater than 1, like 3.948, 4.5, etc. So maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the velocity ratio as the ratio of the speed of the faster gear to the slower one. So if the speed increases by 4, then V_R is 4. So the actual velocity ratio is approximately 4. But the options have 3.948, which is close to 4. So maybe the exact calculation would give a value near 4.

Now, the diametral pitch is given as 8 inches. Diametral pitch (P) is the number of teeth per inch of diameter. So P = number of teeth / diameter. So diameter = number of teeth / P.

The center distance (C_d) is desired to be approximately 12 inches. But for spur gears, the center distance is the sum of the radii of the two gears. So C_d = (d1 + d2)/2, but wait, wait. Wait, radius is diameter divided by 2, so C_d = r1 + r2, which is (d1/2) + (d2/2) = (d1 + d2)/2. So the sum of the diameters divided by 2 gives the center distance.

Wait, no, wait. The formula for center distance in spur gears is C_d = (N1 + N2)/(2*P), because each diameter is N/P, so (N1/P + N2/P)/2? Wait, no, because diameter is N/P, so each radius is N/(2P). So center distance is r1 + r2 = (N1)/(2P) + N2/(2P) = (N1 + N2)/(2P). So C_d = (N1 + N2)/(2P).

But we don't know N1 and N2, right? Because they're the number of teeth on each gear.

We also know that the velocity ratio (V_R) is N1/N2, assuming V_R is the ratio of driver to driven. So if V_R is 4, then N1 = 4 * N2.

So let's set N1 = 4*N2.

Substituting into the center distance equation:

C_d = (N1 + N2)/(2P) = (4N2 + N2)/(2*8) = (5N2)/(16).

But we want C_d to be approximately 12 inches. So,

5N2/16 = 12 → N2 = (12 * 16)/5 = 192/5 = 38.4.

Hmm, but the number of teeth should be an integer, right? So that's a problem. 38.4 isn't an integer. So maybe I need to pick the nearest integers for N2 and N1 that make C_d as close to 12 as possible, while making V_R as close to 4 as possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the given desired C_d is approximate, so we can adjust the number of teeth to get as close as possible.

So let's try with N2 being 38, which would make N1 = 4*38 = 152.

Then C_d = (152 +38)/(2*8) = (190)/(16) = 11.875 inches. That's approximately 11.875, which is close to 12. But the options have some with C_d exactly 12, others 14, etc.

Wait, but 11.875 is nearly 12. So perhaps that's an option. Let me check the options. Option E says V_R=3.948, C_d=12. Hmm, but with N2=38, N1=152, V_R is exactly 4 (because 152/38 = 4). So why would the velocity ratio be 3.948 instead of exactly 4?

Ah, perhaps because the number of teeth can't be fractional. So maybe we need to find integers N1 and N2 such that their sum is as close as possible to 5*N2 = 5*38.4 = 192, but using integers, it's 190. So maybe there's a better combination.

Alternatively, perhaps using different numbers. Let me think: what if N2 is 39? Then N1 would be 4*39=156. Then sum is 195, C_d = 195/(2*8)=195/16≈12.1875. That's about 12.19, which is a bit over 12. So the C_d is then approximately 12.1875. But the desired is 12. So which is better: 11.875 or 12.1875? The former is 0.125 below, the latter 0.1875 above. So 11.875 is closer.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects us to use the exact formula and find the actual velocity ratio, which might not be exactly 4. Because when you take N1 and N2 as integers, the V_R could vary a bit.

Wait, let's think again. The problem says the speed increases by 4 times. So V_R is (speed of driver) / (speed of driven) = 1/4? Because if the driven is 4 times faster, then the ratio is 1/4. No, wait, velocity ratio is usually defined as the ratio of the input speed to the output speed. So if the output is 4 times faster, V_R is 1/4. But that would mean the gear ratio is 4:1, because the output speed is 4 times the input. So I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to define the velocity ratio as the ratio of the output speed to the input speed. Then, if the output is 4 times the input, V_R would be 4. But I'm not sure. I think in gear terminology, the velocity ratio is defined as the ratio of the input speed to the output speed. So when the output increases, the ratio is less than 1. But in some contexts, it's the other way around. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of teeth. The number of teeth is inversely proportional to the speed. So if the driven gear has fewer teeth, it spins faster.

So if V_R is defined as (speed of driver) / (speed of driven), then V_R = N_driven / N_driver. Because speed is inversely proportional to the number of teeth.

Wait, wait, the speed of a gear is inversely proportional to its number of teeth. So if you have two gears, gear A (driver) with N_A teeth and gear B (driven) with N_B teeth, then the speed ratio (N_A / N_B) would be the ratio of their speeds. So if N_A > N_B, then speed of B is higher. So (speed of A)/(speed of B) = N_B / N_A. Because speed is inversely proportional to the number of teeth. So if N_A is larger, speed of A is slower.

So if the speed increases by 4 times, that would mean (speed of B)/(speed of A) =4 → V_R = (speed A)/(speed B) = 1/4.

But wait, the question says "increases the speed of the shaft by approximately 4 times." So the output shaft is rotating 4 times faster than the input. So if V_R is defined as (input speed)/(output speed), then V_R is 1/4. But in that case, the velocity ratio is 0.25. But none of the options have that. All the options have V_R greater than 3. So I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the velocity ratio in the question is defined as the ratio of the output speed to the input speed. So a speed increase of 4 times would imply V_R =4. That would make more sense with the options given.

So, let's proceed with V_R =4. So N1/N2 = V_R =4 → N1=4N2.

Now, the center distance is C_d = (N1 + N2)/(2P). Substituting N1=4N2, we get:

C_d = (4N2 + N2)/(2*8) = 5N2/(16). We want this to be approximately 12 inches.

So 5N2 = 16 *12 → 5N2=192 → N2=38.4. But N2 must be an integer, so let's try N2=38 and N2=39.

For N2=38: N1=4*38=152.

C_d = (152+38)/(2*8)=190/16=11.875 in. ≈11.875. So that's very close to 12, but a bit less.

For N2=39: N1=156.

C_d=(156+39)/(16)=195/16=12.1875 in. So that's about 12.1875, a bit over.

So the desired C_d is 12, so which is closer? 11.875 is 0.125 less than 12, 12.1875 is 0.1875 more. So 11.875 is closer. But none of the options have C_d=11.875. Let's see the options:

Option E is V_R=3.948, C_d=12 in. So how does that happen?

Wait, perhaps the actual V_R isn't exactly 4, but a bit less because N2 and N1 are integers. Let's compute V_R when N2=38, N1=152. Then V_R is 152/38 =4 exactly. So that gives C_d=11.875, which is close to 12.

But the options don't have this exact combination. Let's check the options:

Option E: V_R=3.948, C_d=12.

Wait, how to get V_R=3.948? That's approximately 3.948, which is 3.948 ≈ 3 + 0.948. Let me see, perhaps N1=39 and N2=10? No, wait. Let me think again: perhaps N1 and N2 are such that N1/N2 is about 3.948.

Wait, let me compute 3.948 as N1/N2. Let's see: 3.948 is approximately 39.48/10. So maybe N1=39 and N2=10. But wait, 39/10=3.9, which is less than 3.948. Alternatively, perhaps N1=40 and N2=10.13, but that's not an integer. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps N1 and N2 are 39 and 10, but that would give V_R=3.9. Alternatively, perhaps N1=79 and N2=20, which would give 79/20=3.95. That's close to 3.948. Let me check: 79/20 is 3.95 exactly. But 3.948 is 3.948, which is slightly less.

Wait, perhaps N1=78.46 and N2=20. But since N must be integers, perhaps N1=78 and N2=20 gives V_R=3.9. Hmm, not matching exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps N1= 39.48 and N2=10, but again, N must be integer. So maybe the question is using some approximation.

Wait, perhaps the diametral pitch is 8, and the center distance is exactly 12. So C_d=(N1 + N2)/(2*8) = (N1 + N2)/16 =12. So N1 + N2=192.

And V_R= N1/N2=4. So N1=4N2. Substituting into N1 + N2=192: 4N2 + N2=5N2=192 → N2=38.4. But that's not integer, so we need to find N1 and N2 as integers near 38.4 and 153.6 such that N1 + N2 is as close to 192 as possible, and N1/N2 is as close to 4 as possible.

Possible options:

N2=38 → N1=4*38=152 → sum 190 → C_d=190/16=11.875.

N2=39 → N1=156 → sum 195 → C_d=195/16=12.1875.

Alternatively, maybe N2=38.4 isn't allowed, so perhaps the nearest integers are N2=38 and N1=152.

But then the center distance is 11.875, which is 0.125 less than 12. So perhaps the question is considering a center distance of 12 as acceptable if it's close. But which option matches V_R=4 and C_d=12?

Looking at the options, option E is V_R=3.948 and C_d=12. Hmmm. How to get that? Let's compute for N1 + N2=192 (since C_d=12= (N1+N2)/(16)).

So N1 + N2=192. And V_R= N1/N2=3.948.

So N1=3.948*N2.

Substituting into N1 + N2=192:

3.948 N2 + N2=192 → 4.948 N2=192 → N2≈192/4.948≈38.85.

Hmm, approximately 38.85. So N2=39, N1=3.948*39≈153.9. But since N1 must be integer, let's take N2=39, N1=154.

Then V_R=154/39≈3.9487, which is approximately 3.948.

Then sum N1 + N2=154+39=193. So C_d=193/(16)=12.0625 in. Which is approximately 12.06, but the problem says the center distance is desired to be approximately 12, so 12.06 is close. But the options say C_d=12 exactly.

Wait, but if N1=154 and N2=39, sum is 193. So C_d=193/16=12.0625, which is about 12.06. But option E says C_d=12. So perhaps they rounded it to 12.

Alternatively, maybe N1=153.9 and N2=38.85, which sum to 192.75, but that can't be because N must be integers.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at the options. Option E has V_R=3.948 and C_d=12. So how is that possible?

Wait, N1 + N2=192 (since C_d=12= (N1+N2)/16 → N1+N2=192).

V_R= N1/N2=3.948 → N1=3.948 * N2.

So 3.948 N2 + N2 =192 → 4.948 N2=192 → N2=192 /4.948 ≈38.85.

So N2=38.85, which isn't possible. So they must have chosen N2=39, N1=153.9, which isn't possible. Alternatively, perhaps N2=38, N1=3.948*38=approx 150.

Wait, 3.948*38= 3.948*38= let's compute: 3*38=114, 0.948*38=36.024 → total 150.024. So N1≈150. So sum is 150+38=188. C_d=188/16=11.75 in. But that's not 12. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the exact calculation, and the center distance is approximately 12, so the closest option is E, which has C_d=12 and V_R=3.948.

Wait, but how do they get V_R=3.948? Let me think: perhaps the actual number of teeth is N1=79 and N2=20, because 79+20=99. Then C_d=99/16≈6.1875 in. Which doesn't help.

Alternatively, maybe the diametral pitch is 8, and the center distance is 12, so N1 + N2=16*12=192.

So N1=4*N2 would give 5N2=192 → N2=38.4, which isn't possible. So perhaps the closest is N2=38, N1=152, sum 190, C_d=11.875. But none of the options have that. So the options must be considering
