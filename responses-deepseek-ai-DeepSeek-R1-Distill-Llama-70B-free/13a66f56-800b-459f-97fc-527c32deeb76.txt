The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A man told his neighbor, "If you will mow my lawn, I will pay you $50. " The neighbor then purchased gasoline for the mower so he could mow the lawn. The neighbor wheeled his lawn mower to the man's property and started the engine. At that moment, the man suddenly yelled, "I hereby revoke my offer. "If the neighbor thereafter mows the man's lawn, will he recover the $50?

Options:

A: Yes, because there was an offer for a unilateral contract that became irrevocable prior to the man's attempted revocation.
B: No, because the neighbor had done nothing more than prepare to accept the offer prior to the man's revocation.
C: Yes, because the neighbor can sue for breach of oral contract.
D: Yes, because the neighbor had begun the task before the man revoked his offer.
E: Yes, under the doctrine of quasi-contract.
F: No, because there was no written contract and hence no legal obligation for the man to pay.
G: No, because the neighbor did not get a written agreement from the man.
H: No, because the man's revocation was effective, since the neighbor had not completed performance.
I: No, because the man revoked his offer before the task was completed.
J: Yes, because the neighbor had already incurred expenses in preparation to fulfill the contract.

Okay, so I've got this question about contracts, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again.

So, the situation is that a man offers his neighbor $50 to mow his lawn. The neighbor then buys gasoline for his mower to do the job. He takes the mower to the man's property, starts the engine, and right then, the man yells that he's revoking the offer. The question is if the neighbor mows the lawn after that, can he still get the $50?

Hmm, I remember that contracts can be unilateral or bilateral. A unilateral contract is where one party makes a promise in exchange for some action. So here, the man's offer is probably unilateral because he's promising $50 in exchange for the neighbor mowing the lawn.

Now, the key point is about revocation. I think that for unilateral contracts, the offeror can revoke the offer any time before the offeree starts the performance. But once the offeree has started performing, the offer can't be revoked. This is because the offeree has relied on the offer by beginning the action, so it's not fair to revoke it then.

In this case, the neighbor bought gas and brought the mower over, which shows he was preparing. But when the man revoked the offer, the neighbor had just started the engine. So, had he begun performance yet? Starting the engine might be considered the start of mowing, but maybe not. Alternatively, maybe starting the engine is part of the preparation, not the actual performance.

Wait, I think that under the law, once the offeree starts the performance, the offer becomes irrevocable. So if the neighbor had already started mowing, the man couldn't revoke. But if he was just about to start, maybe the revocation is still effective.

Wait, but in the scenario, the neighbor had already purchased gas and moved the mower to the man's property. So he's incurred some expense and taken substantial steps toward performance. There's something about reliance making the offer irrevocable under the doctrine of promissory estoppel. So maybe even if he hasn't started mowing, the fact that he relied on the offer by buying gas and moving the mower means the offer can't be revoked.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. I remember that for unilateral contracts, the general rule is that the offer can be revoked any time before acceptance, which is the completed performance. But some jurisdictions might consider that once the offeree has begun performance in good faith, the offeror can't revoke it.

So in this case, the neighbor started the engine, which might be enough to constitute beginning the performance. Alternatively, maybe just arriving there with the mower isn't enough, but starting the engine is part of the performance.

Alternatively, maybe the offer is revoked before the neighbor actually started mowing, so the revocation is effective. So the neighbor can't claim the $50 because the performance wasn't completed yet.

Wait, but I'm also thinking about the concept of 'substantial steps.' If the neighbor took substantial steps in reliance on the offer, then the offeror can't revoke the offer. So the neighbor bought gas, brought the mower, and started itâ€”those are substantial steps towards mowing the lawn.

So perhaps the offer became irrevocable once the neighbor started relying on it by taking those steps. So even though he hadn't completed mowing, the offer couldn't be revoked anymore.

Looking at the options:

Option A says yes because it was a unilateral contract that became irrevocable before revocation. That would be correct if the neighbor started performance.

Option B says no because the neighbor only prepared to accept. So if starting the mower isn't enough, then B would be correct.

Option D says yes because he began the task. If starting the engine counts as beginning, D is correct.

Option J says yes because he incurred expenses. That's about reliance.

I think the correct rule is that in unilateral contracts, once the offeree begins performance, the offer can't be revoked. So if the neighbor started the mower, that's the start of performance. So the man couldn't revoke it.

So the answer would be A or D. Option A says it's irrevocable prior to revocation. D says because he began the task.

Wait, the man revoked the offer at the moment the neighbor started the engine. So did the revocation happen before or after the performance began? If the revocation was at the same moment as starting the engine, maybe it's too late.

Alternatively, some sources say that the offeror can revoke any time before the offeree begins performance. Once performance begins, revocation is not allowed.

So if the neighbor began mowing (started the engine and started cutting), then revocation is too late. But if he just started the engine but hasn't begun mowing yet, maybe the revocation is still effective.

Wait, but in the problem, the neighbor started the engine. Does that count as beginning the performance? I think starting the engine is part of the process, but maybe the actual mowing (cutting the grass) is the performance. So perhaps the revocation was before the performance started.

In that case, the offer was revoked before the neighbor started mowing, so the neighbor can't get the $50.

So looking at the options, option B says no because he did nothing more than prepare. So B would be correct.

Alternatively, if starting the engine is considered the start of performance, then the revocation came too late, so the neighbor can still get the $50. Then A or D would be correct.

I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think of the case law. I remember that in some cases, like where someone offers a reward, the offer can be revoked before the performance is completed. But once the offeree has started, it's too late.

Wait, in the case of Drennan v. Star Paving Co., the court held that once the offeree begins performance, the offeror can't revoke. But in that case, the offeree was a subcontractor who had started doing the work. So, when the offeror tried to revoke after the subcontractor began, the revocation was too late.

In our problem, if the neighbor began mowing (started the engine and started cutting), then revocation is too late. But if he just started the engine but hasn't begun cutting yet, maybe he hasn't started performance.

Wait, the problem says he "started the engine." So perhaps the engine starting is part of the preparation. Maybe the performance is the actual mowing, not just starting the engine.

In that case, the neighbor hadn't started mowing yet, so the offer could be revoked.

So, in that case, the revocation was effective, and the neighbor can't recover the $50.

Looking at the options, option B says No, because the neighbor did nothing more than prepare. That's correct because he hasn't started the performance yet.

Wait, but he bought gas and moved the mower. Those are acts in preparation but not performance itself. So the offer can still be revoked.

So the answer would be B.

Wait, but some might argue that starting the engine is part of the performance. It's a bit of a line-drawing issue.

Alternatively, another angle: in a unilateral contract, the offer is revoked when the offeror communicates revocation before the offeree completes performance. But if the offeree has begun performance, the offer is irrevocable.

So if the neighbor had started mowing, the revocation is too late. If he just started the engine and was about to mow, maybe it's not considered started yet.

So, in this case, the neighbor had not yet started mowing, so the revocation is effective, and he can't get the $50.

So, the answer would be B: No, because the neighbor had done nothing more than prepare to accept the offer prior to the revocation.

Wait, but what about reliance? The neighbor relied on the offer by purchasing gas and moving the mower. Doesn't that count under promissory estoppel?

Hmm, maybe. If the neighbor incurred expenses in reliance, the offeror might be estopped from revoking. But I think that applies more to bilateral contracts. In unilateral contracts, the offer can be revoked unless the offeree has started performance.

So perhaps the answer depends on whether the acts taken are considered part of performance. If not, then B is correct. If they are, then A or D is correct.

I'm a bit confused, but I'll go with B as the answer because starting the engine isn't the actual performance of mowing.

The question revolves around a unilateral contract where the man offered $50 to his neighbor in exchange for mowing his lawn. The neighbor took preparatory steps, including buying gasoline, moving the mower to the man's property, and starting the engine. At that moment, the man revoked the offer. The issue is whether the neighbor can still recover the $50 if he proceeds to mow the lawn.

In unilateral contracts, the general rule is that the offeror can revoke the offer at any time before the offeree completes performance. However, once the offeree begins performance, the offer becomes irrevocable. The key question is whether the neighbor had started performance when the man revoked the offer.

Starting the engine could be interpreted as the beginning of performance, but it might also be seen as part of the preparatory steps rather than the actual mowing. If the neighbor had not yet started cutting the grass, the revocation might still be effective. The neighbor's reliance on the offer by purchasing gasoline and moving the mower could be relevant under the doctrine of promissory estoppel, but this is more applicable to bilateral contracts. In unilateral contracts, the focus is on whether performance has begun.

Given that the neighbor had not yet started mowing, the revocation was likely effective. Therefore, the neighbor cannot recover the $50.
