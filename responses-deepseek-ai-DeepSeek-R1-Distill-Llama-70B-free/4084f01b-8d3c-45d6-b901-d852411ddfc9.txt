Okay, so I've got this mass spectrometer question here, and I'm a bit nervous because I don't remember all the details, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, there are two types of mass spectrometers mentioned. In the first type, charged particles pass through a velocity selector before entering the magnetic field. In the second type, they pass through a strong electric field first. The question is about comparing the ratio of the radii of singly charged lithium ions with masses 6 amu and 7 amu in these two cases.

Hmm, velocity selector... I remember that a velocity selector is a region where particles are subjected to perpendicular electric and magnetic fields. The idea is that only particles with a specific velocity pass through. The velocity is given by v = E/B, where E is the electric field and B is the magnetic field strength. So, in the first case, the particles are velocity-selected before entering the magnetic field.

In the second case, it's a strong electric field. Oh wait, that's probably a region where the particles are accelerated by the electric field. Like, maybe they're given a certain kinetic energy. Then they enter the magnetic field.

Wait, in mass spectrometers, the setup often involves particles being accelerated through a potential difference (so electric field) which gives them kinetic energy, and then they enter a magnetic field where they move in a circular path. The radius of that path is determined by their mass-to-charge ratio. So the formula I remember is r = (m*v)/(q*B), but since they're accelerated by a voltage, maybe their velocity is determined by that voltage.

Wait, but in the first case, the velocity selector comes before the magnetic field. So in that setup, I think the particles are pre-selected to have a specific velocity, then they enter the magnetic field where they are separated based on mass.

So, the key here is to find the radius in each setup for each isotope and compare the ratios.

Let me get the formulas straight.

First setup: velocity selector followed by magnetic field.

In the velocity selector, particles are moving with velocity v where v = E/B (E is electric field, B is magnetic field of the selector). So all particles that exit the velocity selector have this specific v. Then, when they enter the main magnetic field (let's say B0), their radius r is given by r = (m*v)/(q*B0). Since v is fixed by the velocity selector, r is proportional to m/q. Since the ions are singly charged, q is the same, so r is proportional to m.

So for the two masses, 6 amu and 7 amu, their radii would be in the ratio of 6:7. Wait, 6 amu is lighter, so it would have a smaller radius? Wait no, wait. Wait, if m is larger, then r is larger. So 7 amu would have a larger radius than 6 amu. So the ratio r(7)/r(6) is 7/6 ≈ 1.1667.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the ratio of the radii of 6 amu to 7 amu? Or of 7 to 6? The question says "the ratio of the radii of singly charged lithium ions of masses 6 amu and 7 amu in the two cases." So it's r6/r7 for each case.

Wait, no: wait, in the first case, using the velocity selector, r is proportional to m. So r6 = (6 amu)*k, r7=(7 amu)*k, so r6/r7 = 6/7 ≈ 0.857.

In the second setup, the particles go through a strong electric field first, which I think is the more traditional setup where they're accelerated by a voltage. In this case, the kinetic energy (1/2 mv²) comes from the electric potential (qV). So 1/2 mv² = qV → v = sqrt(2qV/m). Then when they enter the magnetic field, the radius is r = mv/(qB) → substituting v, r = m/(qB) * sqrt(2qV/m) ) = sqrt( (2 m q V )/(q² B²) ) → simplifying, r = sqrt(2 m V )/(q B). Wait, because q cancels out.

Wait, let me re-derive that. So when the ions are accelerated through a voltage V, the kinetic energy gained is qV = (1/2)m v² → v = sqrt(2 q V / m). Then in the magnetic field B, the radius is (m v)/(q B). Substituting v: r = [m * sqrt(2 q V/m)] / (q B) → simplify numerator: sqrt(m² * 2 q V/m ) → sqrt(2 q V m). So r = sqrt(2 q V m) / (q B) → which is sqrt( (2 V m) ) / (B sqrt(q)) )? Hmm, maybe another approach.

Wait, let me do it step by step.

Kinetic energy: qV = (1/2)m v² → v = sqrt( (2 q V) / m )

Then in the magnetic field, the radius is given by r = (m v) / (q B).

Substituting v into this:

r = [m * sqrt( (2 q V) / m ) ] / (q B )

= [ sqrt( m² * (2 q V)/m ) ) ] / (q B )

= [ sqrt( m * 2 q V ) ) ] / (q B )

So,

r = sqrt( (2 m q V) ) / (q B )

= sqrt( 2 m V ) / ( sqrt(q) * B )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the radius being proportional to sqrt(m). Let me see: because if v is sqrt(2 qV/m ), then r = (m v)/(q B) = m/(q B) * sqrt( 2 q V / m ) ) = [ m * sqrt(2 q V) ] / [ q B * sqrt(m) ) ].

Simplify numerator and denominator: m / sqrt(m) is sqrt(m), and sqrt(q) from sqrt(2 q V). So,

r = [ sqrt(m) * sqrt(2 V) * sqrt(q) ) ] / ( q B )

Wait, perhaps I should factor it differently. Let me try again.

r = (m v )/( q B ) → v = sqrt(2 q V/m )

So,

r = m/(q B) * sqrt(2 q V/m )

= [ m / (q B) ) ] * [ sqrt(2 q V) / sqrt(m) ) ]

= [ m / (q B) ) ] * [ sqrt(2 q V) ) / sqrt(m) ) ]

= [ sqrt(m) * sqrt(2 q V) ) ] / ( q B )

= sqrt( m * 2 q V ) / ( q B )

= sqrt( 2 V m / q ) * sqrt(q) / (B )

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me look for a simpler approach. Maybe I should just express r in terms of m.

From the electric field acceleration:

v = sqrt( (2 q V ) / m )

Then,

r = (m v )/( q B ) → substituting v,

r = [ m * sqrt(2 q V/m ) ] / (q B )

Simplify the numerator: m * sqrt(2 q V/m ) = sqrt( m^2 * 2 q V / m ) = sqrt( 2 q V m )

So,

r = sqrt(2 q V m ) / ( q B )

= sqrt(2 V m ) / ( sqrt(q) B )

Wait, but in a mass spectrometer, the charge q is the same for both isotopes, so let's assume they're singly charged, so q is same for both, and same B (since same magnetic field). So the denominator is same for both isotopes, and the numerator is sqrt(2 V m ), so r is proportional to sqrt(m).

So in the second setup, the radius is proportional to sqrt(m). Therefore, for m=6 and m=7, the radii are sqrt(6) and sqrt(7).

So the ratio r6/r7 is sqrt(6/7) ≈ sqrt(0.857) ≈ 0.926.

Wait, because sqrt(6) ≈ 2.449, sqrt(7)≈2.6458. 2.449 /2.6458 ≈ 0.926.

So for the first case (velocity selector first), r6/r7 is 6/7 ≈ 0.857.

In the second case (electric field first), r6/r7 is sqrt(6/7) ≈ 0.926.

So the question is asking for the ratio in the first case and the ratio in the second case, and to choose the correct option that lists these two ratios. But wait, the question says: "Compare the ratio of the radii of singly charged lithium ions of masses 6 amu and 7 amu in the two cases." So I think it's asking for the ratios in each case, and pick the option where the two ratios are 0.857 and 0.926.

Looking at the options:

Option G: 0.857 and 0.926.

Option H: 0.926 and 0.857.

Wait, so which one is for which case. Let me make sure.

In the first case (velocity selector), the ratio is 6/7 ≈ 0.857. So it's 0.857.

In the second case (electric field first), the ratio is sqrt(6/7) ≈ 0.926.

So the two ratios are 0.857 (case1) and 0.926 (case2).

So the options would have these two numbers. Looking at the options:

Option G: 0.857 and 0.926 → so first case and then second case.

Option H is the reverse.

But the question is: the first setup (velocity selector) gives 0.857, and the second setup (electric field) gives 0.926. So the ratios are 0.857 (first) and 0.926 (second). So looking for an option where the first number is ~0.857 and second is ~0.926, which is option G.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option G is 0.857 and 0.926.

Option H is 0.926 and 0.857.

So the correct answer should be option G.

Wait, but wait the question is phrased as "the ratio of the radii of ... 6 amu and 7 amu in the two cases". So for each case, compute r6/r7.

In the first case (velocity selector): r = m/(qB) * v. Since v is fixed, r is proportional to m. So r6/r7 = 6/7 ≈ 0.857.

In the second case (electric field first): r is proportional to sqrt(m), so r6/r7 = sqrt(6/7) ≈ 0.926.

So the two ratios are 0.857 and 0.926.

Looking at the options, option G is 0.857 and 0.926. So the correct answer is G.

But wait, let's check the options again.

Option G: 0.857 and 0.926.

Yes, that's correct.

In a mass spectrometer, the radius of the circular path of charged particles in a magnetic field depends on their mass-to-charge ratio and their velocity. The question compares two setups:

1. **Velocity selector first**: In this setup, particles pass through a velocity selector where their velocity is fixed as \( v = \frac{E}{B} \). After exiting the selector, they enter a magnetic field \( B_0 \), where the radius of their path is given by \( r = \frac{m v}{q B_0} \). Since \( v \) is constant, \( r \) is proportional to \( m \). For singly charged lithium ions with masses 6 amu and 7 amu, the ratio of their radii is \( \frac{r_6}{r_7} = \frac{6}{7} \approx 0.857 \).

2. **Electric field first**: In this setup, particles are accelerated through a potential difference \( V \), gaining kinetic energy \( qV = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \). This gives them a velocity \( v = \sqrt{\frac{2 q V}{m}} \). When they enter the magnetic field, the radius is \( r = \frac{m v}{q B} \). Substituting \( v \), \( r \) becomes proportional to \( \sqrt{m} \). For the same isotopes, the ratio of their radii is \( \frac{r_6}{r_7} = \sqrt{\frac{6}{7}} \approx 0.926 \).

Thus, the ratios of the radii for the two cases are approximately **0.857** (velocity selector first) and **0.926** (electric field first). Among the given options, the correct one is:

**G: 0.857 and 0.926.**
