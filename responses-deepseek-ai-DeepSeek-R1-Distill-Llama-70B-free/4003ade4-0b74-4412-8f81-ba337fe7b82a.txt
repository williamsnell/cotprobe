Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a clock controlled by a pendulum. Hmm, I remember that pendulums are used in clocks to keep time, right? The problem says the pendulum correctly beats seconds at 20°C. But when the temperature is 30°C, the clock starts losing time. I need to find out how many seconds it loses in a week.

Alright, let's break this down. I think it has to do with thermal expansion. The pendulum is a light iron rod with a coefficient of linear expansion given as 16e-6 per degree Celsius. So when the temperature increases, the rod should expand, right?

Wait, the pendulum's length affects its period. The formula for the period of a simple pendulum is T = 2π√(L/g), where L is the length and g is acceleration due to gravity. So, if the length changes, the period changes. Since the clock is controlled by the pendulum, a longer period would mean the clock runs slow.

Right, so the period is proportional to the square root of the length. So, if the length increases, the period increases, causing the clock to lose time. Because each tick would take longer than a second, adding up over a week.

Let me think about the steps:

1. Calculate the change in length of the pendulum due to temperature increase.
2. Find out the new period based on the new length.
3. Determine the difference in time over a week.

Wait, but since the pendulum beats correctly at 20°C, that's our reference. At 30°C, which is 10 degrees higher, the length increases.

The formula for linear expansion is ΔL = α * L0 * ΔT. But wait, we don't have the original length. Hmm, but maybe we don't need it because when we take the ratio, the L0 might cancel out.

Wait, the period T is proportional to sqrt(L). So, T = k * sqrt(L), where k is some constant. So, the fractional change in T would be (1/2) times the fractional change in L, because dT/T ≈ (1/2) dL/L.

Wait, let me think. Differentiating T with respect to L:

dT/dL = (1/(2√L)) * (1/k) )

But since T = k√L, then dT/dL = (k * (1/(2√L))) = T/(2L). So, dT/T = (dT/dL) * dL = (T/(2L)) * dL = (dL)/(2L) * (T/T) )? Wait, maybe it's better to consider relative changes.

Alternatively, the change in period can be approximated by:

ΔT/T ≈ (1/2) * (ΔL/L)

Because:

T = 2π√(L/g) → T² = (4π² L)/g → L = (g T²)/(4π²). So, fractional change in L is (dL/L) = 2 (dT/T).

Wait no, let me get this straight. Let me take natural logs:

ln T = (1/2) ln L + constants.

Differentiating both sides:

(1/T) dT = (1/(2L)) dL → dT/T = (1/2)(dL/L).

So, the fractional change in period is half the fractional change in length. That's correct.

So, first, calculate the fractional change in length. The temperature change is 10°C (from 20 to 30). So, ΔT = 10°C.

Coefficient of linear expansion α = 16e-6 per °C.

So, (ΔL)/L = α ΔT = 16e-6 *10 = 160e-6 = 1.6e-4.

Then, the fractional change in period (ΔT/T) is (1/2)(1.6e-4) = 0.8e-4.

But wait, wait a second. Because when the length increases, the period increases, so the clock will run slow. Each second will take longer than a second. So, the number of beats per second will decrease. So, over a week, the clock will lose time.

Now, the question is, how much time is lost in a week?

The clock is supposed to tick once per second. But each tick now takes longer. Let's find the ratio between the new period and the old period.

The period at 20°C is correct, so T0 = 1 second. At 30°C, the period becomes T = T0 * (1 + ΔT/T).

Wait, ΔT is the change, so T = T0 (1 + (ΔT/T)) ) → 1 * (1 + 0.8e-4) ) = 1.00008 seconds per beat.

Wait, but each beat is supposed to be 1 second, but now it's longer. So, in one week, how many seconds will have passed according to the clock, versus the actual time.

Wait, alternatively, think about how many beats occur in a week. Normally, in a week, there are 7*24*60*60 = 604800 seconds. So, the clock would have 604800 beats.

But with the increased period, each beat is 1.00008 seconds. So, the actual time that passes during those beats is 604800 * 1.00008 seconds.

Wait, but that's the actual time. But wait, the clock is slow. So, the clock shows 604800 seconds, but the real time is more. So, the clock loses time.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the difference between real time and the clock's time.

But wait, the real time for a week is 604800 seconds. But the clock's beats are longer. So, the number of beats the clock can do in a real week is less than 604800.

Wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think.

In real time t, the number of beats the clock makes is t / T, where T is the period.

But in a real week (t=604800 s), the number of beats is 604800 / T.

But when T is 1.00008 s, then the number of beats is 604800 / 1.00008 ≈ 604800 * (1 - 0.8e-4) ) → approximately 604800 - (604800 * 0.8e-4).

So, the clock will have counted about 604800 - (604800 * 0.8e-4) beats, which is 604800 - 483.84 ≈ 604316.16.

Wait, but that can't be right, because the real time is 604800 seconds, but the clock only advances 604316.16 seconds, meaning it has lost 483.84 seconds. But that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me try a different way.

The fractional change in period is 0.8e-4. So, each second is 1.00008 seconds. So, over a week, the clock will run slow by some amount.

Wait, let's think about how much the period increases. The period increases by 0.8e-4 per second. So, each beat takes 0.8e-4 seconds longer. Since each beat is a second, but now it's 1 + 0.8e-4 seconds per beat.

In a week, the clock is supposed to have 604800 beats. Each beat taking 1.00008 seconds, so the total real time would be 604800 * 1.00008 seconds. But wait, that's the real time, but the clock is behind. Wait, no.

Wait, the real time is one week, which is 604800 seconds. But the clock, which is slow, will have measured fewer seconds.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the number of clock seconds that pass in real time t. So, the number of beats is t / T.

So, clock_time = t / T.

Since T = 1 * (1 + delta), delta is 0.8e-4.

So, clock_time = t / (1 + delta) ≈ t * (1 - delta) for small delta.

So, clock_time ≈ t * (1 - 0.8e-4) → 604800 * (1 - 0.8e-4) = 604800 - (604800 * 0.8e-4) → 604800 - 483.84 ≈ 604316.16 seconds.

So the clock loses 483.84 seconds in a week. But wait, the options don't have that. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, the coefficient of expansion is 16e-6 per degree C. The temperature change is 10 degrees.

So, ΔL = alpha * L0 * delta_T = 16e-6 * 10 = 1.6e-4. So (ΔL)/L0 = 1.6e-4.

Then, the period increases by half that fraction, so (ΔT)/T = 0.8e-4.

Wait a second, but the period is T = 2π sqrt(L/g). So, the relative change in T is (1/2) * (ΔL/L).

So, correct.

But then, each second, the clock is taking 1.00008 seconds. So, in real time t, the clock shows t / (1.00008) ≈ t (1 - 0.8e-4).

So, for a real time of 604800 seconds, the clock shows 604800 * (1 - 0.8e-4) = 604800 - (604800 * 0.8e-4).

Compute 604800 * 0.8e-4:

0.8e-4 is 0.00008.

604800 * 0.00008 = 6048 * 0.8 = 4838.4? Wait, no.

Wait, 604800 * 0.00008 → 604800 * 8e-5 = (604800 / 1e5) ) *8 = 6.048 * 8 = 48.384.

Wait, no, wait 0.00008 is 8e-5. So 604800 * 8e-5 = ?

604800 * 8 = 4,838,400.

Then multiply by 1e-5 → 4,838,400 * 1e-5 = 48.384.

So the clock shows 604800 - 48.384 = 604,751.616 seconds.

Wait, but that's a loss of 48.384 seconds. Looking at the options, H is 48.4 s, which is close.

But wait, the options are for a week. So, 48.384 seconds is approximately 48.4 seconds. So option H.

Wait, but wait, I thought the change in period would lead to a loss of about 48 seconds in a week. But let me make sure I didn't make a miscalculation.

Wait, so the total time lost is 48.384 seconds, which is approximately 48.4 s. So the correct option is H: 48.4 s.

Wait, but let me think again. The fractional change in period is 0.8e-4, so the loss per second is 0.8e-4 seconds per second. So in one week (604800 seconds), the total loss is 604800 * 0.8e-4.

Wait that's 604800 * 0.00008 = ?

Well, 604800 * 0.00008 = 48.384, which matches what I had before. So yes, about 48.4 seconds.

Looking back at the options, option H is 48.4 s. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure about the sign. Since the temperature increases, the pendulum lengthens, period increases, so the clock runs slow. So it loses time. So the calculation is correct.

To determine how many seconds the clock loses in a week due to the thermal expansion of the pendulum, we analyze the relationship between temperature, pendulum length, and the period of oscillation.

### Key Steps:

1. **Thermal Expansion of the Pendulum**:  
   The pendulum is a light iron rod with a coefficient of linear expansion:  
   \[
   \alpha = 16 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{°C}^{-1}.
   \]  
   The temperature increases from \(20^\circ \text{C}\) to \(30^\circ \text{C}\), so:  
   \[
   \Delta T = 10^\circ \text{C}.
   \]  
   The fractional change in length of the pendulum is:  
   \[
   \frac{\Delta L}{L_0} = \alpha \cdot \Delta T = (16 \times 10^{-6}) \cdot 10 = 1.6 \times 10^{-4}.
   \]

2. **Effect on the Period of the Pendulum**:  
   The period of a simple pendulum is given by:  
   \[
   T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}},
   \]  
   where \(L\) is the length of the pendulum and \(g\) is the acceleration due to gravity. Differentiating \(T\) with respect to \(L\), we find:  
   \[
   \frac{\Delta T}{T} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\Delta L}{L}.
   \]  
   Substituting \(\frac{\Delta L}{L} = 1.6 \times 10^{-4}\):  
   \[
   \frac{\Delta T}{T} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1.6 \times 10^{-4} = 0.8 \times 10^{-4}.
   \]  
   Thus, the fractional increase in the period is \(0.8 \times 10^{-4}\).

3. **Time Lost in a Week**:  
   A week has \(7 \times 24 \times 60 \times 60 = 604800\) seconds. Since the clock's period increases by \(0.8 \times 10^{-4}\), the total time lost in a week is:  
   \[
   \text{Time Lost} = 604800 \cdot 0.8 \times 10^{-4}.
   \]  
   Calculating:  
   \[
   604800 \cdot 0.8 \times 10^{-4} = 604800 \cdot 0.00008 = 48.384 \, \text{seconds}.
   \]  
   Approximating to one decimal place:  
   \[
   \text{Time Lost} \approx 48.4 \, \text{seconds}.
   \]

### Conclusion:  
The clock loses approximately **48.4 seconds** in a week due to the thermal expansion of the pendulum. The correct answer is:

**H: 48.4 s**
