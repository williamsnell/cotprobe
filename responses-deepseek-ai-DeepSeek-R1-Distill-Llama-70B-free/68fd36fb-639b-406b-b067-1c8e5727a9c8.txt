Question:

A research project compared the performance of learning disabled and of normal students on ten scales of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children ~ Revised (WISC-R). Ten univariate analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were run to test for differences between the two groups, but use of a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) would have been more desirable because MANOVA

Options:

A: can account for more variables simultaneously
B: is a more recent development in statistical analysis
C: reduces the need for subsequent regression analysis
D: can handle larger datasets more effectively
E: usually offers greater protection against Type Il error
F: requires less computational power
G: usually offers greater protection against a Type I error
H: allows for more detailed individual participant analysis
I: is conceptually and computationally a simpler and more efficient approach

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about statistics, specifically comparing ANOVA and MANOVA. Hmm, I remember that both are statistical tests used to compare groups, but they have some differences.

The question says that a research project looked at performance of learning disabled vs. normal students across ten scales of the WISC-R. They ran ten separate ANOVAs. But the question states that using MANOVA would have been better because... and then gives options.

Wait, why would MANOVA be better here? I think when you have multiple dependent variables, doing multiple ANOVAs can increase the Type I error rate. Because each ANOVA is a separate test, the more you do, the higher the chance of a false positive. Oh right, the family-wise error rate goes up when you do multiple tests.

MANOVA, on the other hand, considers all the dependent variables together. It accounts for the correlations between them, right? So instead of testing each variable separately, you test them in a multivariate way. That should control the overall Type I error rate better because it's one test instead of ten.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Can account for more variables simultaneously. Well, MANOVA does handle multiple variables, but the point is more about controlling error rates, not just handling variables.

Option B: More recent? I don't think so. ANOVA and MANOVA have been around for a while. Not sure about which is more recent, but that's not the main reason here.

Option C: Reduces need for regression. Hmm, maybe not directly related. The question is about why MANOVA is better when doing multiple tests.

Option D: Handle larger datasets. Not sure, but MANOVA might have more power but also requires more assumptions, like multivariate normality. But dataset size isn't the main issue here.

Option E: Greater protection against Type II error. Type II is failing to detect a real effect. I'm not sure if MANOVA affects Type II more than ANOVA in this context. Maybe, but the main issue is Type I.

Option F: Less computational power. Probably not, since MANOVA is more complex computationally.

Option G: Greater protection against Type I error. Yes, that's what I was thinking earlier. Because doing multiple ANOVAs increases the Type I error, MANOVA would offer better protection by keeping the error rate at the desired level across all tests.

Option H: More detailed individual analysis. No, MANOVA is an omnibus test. If you want details, you might still need follow-up tests, maybe discriminant analysis or something.

Option I: Simpler and more efficient. I don't think so. MANOVA is more complex in approach, but more efficient statistically because of error control.

So the correct answer should be G: usually offers greater protection against a Type I error.

MANOVA is more desirable in this scenario because it addresses the issue of inflated Type I error rates that arise when performing multiple univariate ANOVAs. By considering all dependent variables simultaneously, MANOVA controls the overall Type I error rate more effectively than running separate ANOVAs for each variable. This makes it a more appropriate choice when analyzing multiple scales, as in the case of the WISC-R.

The correct answer is:

G: usually offers greater protection against a Type I error.
