Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of relativistic calculations. Let's try to break it down. The question is about finding the potential difference an electron needs to be accelerated to reach a certain speed, and we have to do it relativistically. Hmm, right, because at high speeds, classical mechanics doesn't work anymore. So I remember that when velocities are a significant fraction of the speed of light, we have to use Einstein's relativity.

The given speed is v = 1.8 x 10^7 m/s. Wait, what's the speed of light? Oh yeah, c is approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s. So 1.8e7 is 6% of c, which isn't super high, but still enough that relativistic effects matter. So I can't just use the classical kinetic energy formula here.

So the setup is that an electron is accelerated through a potential difference V, and gains kinetic energy equal to eV, where e is the elementary charge. But wait, in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore. Oh right, the relativistic kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest energy. So the formula is K = (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor.

So the plan is to set eV equal to (γ - 1)mc² and solve for V. That makes sense. Let me jot down the steps.

First, I need to calculate γ. γ is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I'll plug in v = 1.8e7 m/s and c = 3e8 m/s.

Let me compute v²/c² first. v squared is (1.8e7)^2. Let's see, 1.8 squared is 3.24, so 3.24e14. c squared is (3e8)^2 = 9e16. So v²/c² is 3.24e14 / 9e16 = 3.24 / 9e2 = 0.36 / 100 = 0.0036. Wait, no, wait. 3.24e14 divided by 9e16 is (3.24/9) * 1e-2. 3.24/9 is 0.36, so 0.36 * 0.01 = 0.0036. So 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.0036 = 0.9964.

Then sqrt(0.9964) is approximately... let's think. The square root of 0.99 is about 0.99499, right? So sqrt(0.9964) would be a little higher. Let me calculate it more accurately. Let's see, 0.9964 = 0.9964. Let me compute sqrt(0.9964). Let me think about using a linear approximation or maybe just a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a Taylor expansion around x=1 for sqrt(1 - x). Let me set x = 1 - 0.9964 = 0.0036. Wait, no, wait. Wait, sqrt(1 - x) ≈ 1 - x/2 - x²/8 when x is small. So here, 1 - x is 0.9964, so x = 0.0036.

So sqrt(0.9964) ≈ 1 - 0.0036/2 - (0.0036)^2 / 8. That's 1 - 0.0018 - (0.00001296)/8. 0.0018 is 0.0018, and the next term is 0.00000162, which is negligible. So sqrt(0.9964) ≈ 0.9982.

So γ is 1 / 0.9982 ≈ 1.0018. Wait, that can't be right because 1/0.9982 is approximately 1.0018... Wait, wait, no, 1/0.9982 is about 1.0018? No, wait, 1/0.9982 is approximately 1.0018? Wait, no, let me compute 1 divided by 0.9982.

Wait, 0.9982 * 1.0018 is roughly (since 1.0018 * 0.9982 = 1 - (0.0018)^2 + ...), which is approximately 1. So yes, 1/0.9982 is about 1.0018.

Wait, but wait, if v is 0.18c, then beta is 0.18, and gamma is about 1.02 or something? Hmm, maybe my approximation is off because I used a first-order expansion but maybe I should compute it more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I can just calculate it numerically.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it properly. Let me compute 1 - v²/c² = 0.9964. So the square root is sqrt(0.9964) = let's see, 0.9964 is between 0.9964= (0.9982)^2? Let's compute 0.9982^2: 0.9982 * 0.9982. Let's compute (1 - 0.0018)^2 = 1 - 0.0036 + 0.00000324) → 0.99640324. Oh, wait, which is exactly the value we have. So sqrt(0.9964) is 0.9982, so γ is 1/0.9982 ≈ 1.0018. Wait, but that would make βv = v/c = 0.18, and γ is about 1.02? I thought at 0.8c, gamma is 1.666, but at 0.6c, it's about 1.25. So at 0.18c, gamma should be close to 1.02.

Wait, but wait, let me compute gamma precisely. Let me compute 1/(sqrt(1 - (v²/c²))).

v is 1.8e7 m/s, c is 3e8. So v/c = 0.18. So v²/c² is (0.18)^2 = 0.0324. So 1 - 0.0324 = 0.9676. Wait, wait, wait, no, I think I made a mistake earlier. Oh no, wait. The v given is 1.8e7, which is 18,000,000 m/s. c is 300,000,000 m/s. So 18e6 / 3e8 = 0.06. 0.06 times c. So v is 0.06c, so beta is 0.06. So beta squared is 0.0036. So 1 - beta squared is 0.9964. So yes, sqrt(0.9964) is 0.9982, so gamma is 1.0018.

Wait, but that seems low. Let me think again. Wait, when beta is 0.06, then gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.0036) = 1 / sqrt(0.9964) ≈ 1.0018, yes. So gamma is approximately 1.0018. So the total energy is gamma * m c squared. The rest energy is m c squared, so the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c squared.

So the kinetic energy K = (gamma - 1) m c². Since the electron is accelerated through potential V, the kinetic energy comes from eV. So eV = (gamma - 1) m c².

We can solve for V: V = (gamma -1) m c² / e.

So I need to plug in the numbers. Let me list the constants:

m (electron mass) = 9.10938356e-31 kg.

e (elementary charge) = 1.602176634e-19 C.

c = 3e8 m/s.

V = (gamma -1) * m c² / e.

Given that gamma is approximately 1.0018, gamma -1 is 0.0018.

So let's compute that step by step.

First, compute m c²:

m c² = 9.10938356e-31 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2.

Compute (3e8)^2 = 9e16 m²/s².

So m c² = 9.10938356e-31 kg * 9e16 m²/s² = 8.1983436e-14 J.

Wait, that's the rest energy of the electron, which I know is approximately 0.511 MeV, but let me see the exact value.

Alternatively, I can recall that 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 0.511 MeV is 511,000 eV, which is 511 keV. So 0.511 MeV in joules is 511,000 * 1.602e-19 J ≈ 8.187e-14 J, which matches the calculation above. So that's correct.

So, m c^2 = 8.198e-14 J.

So (gamma - 1) m c^2 = 0.0018 * 8.198e-14 J.

Let me compute that: 0.0018 * 8.198e-14 = (1.8e-3) * 8.198e-14 = 1.8 * 8.198e-17.

Compute 1.8 * 8.198: 8.198 * 2 is 16.396, so 8.198 * 1.8 is 14.7564.

So 14.7564e-17 J.

So the kinetic energy K is 1.47564e-16 J.

Now, the potential V is K / e.

So V = (1.47564e-16 J) / (1.602176634e-19 C) = (1.47564 / 1.602176634) * 1e3 Volts.

Compute 1.47564 / 1.602176634.

Let me do that division:

1.602176634 goes into 1.47564 how many times? Let's see:

1.602 * 0.92 = approx 1.474. Because 1.602 * 0.9 = 1.4418, and 1.602*0.02=0.03204. So 1.4418+0.03204=1.47384. Close to 1.47564.

So approximately 0.92 times.

So 0.92 * 1e3 = 920 volts. So V is approximately 920 volts.

Looking at the options, option H is 980, option B is 924, option D is 800, E is 870, J is 1000.

Wait, but I approximated gamma as 1.0018, but let me be more precise.

Wait, let me compute gamma more accurately. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

v = 1.8e7 m/s, c=3e8 m/s. So beta = v/c = 0.06.

So beta squared is 0.0036.

So 1 - beta squared is 0.9964.

So sqrt(0.9964) is approximately 0.9982, as I thought. So gamma is approx 1.001803... Let me compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 1 / sqrt(0.9964). Let's compute sqrt(0.9964) precisely.

Wait, perhaps using calculator-like steps.

Compute sqrt(0.9964). Let me write it as x = sqrt(0.9964). Let me make an initial guess x0 = 0.9982, as before.

Compute x0 squared: 0.9982^2 = (1 - 0.0018)^2 = 1 - 0.0036 + 0.00000324 = 0.99640324.

Which is a bit higher than 0.9964. So actual x is a bit higher than 0.9982, because 0.9982^2 is 0.99640324, which is larger than 0.9964. So to find x where x²=0.9964, since 0.9982²=0.99640324, which is larger than 0.9964, so x must be a bit smaller than 0.9982. Let me compute the next iteration.

Let me let x1 = x0 - delta. Let f(x) = x² - 0.9964. We have f(x0)=0.99640324 - 0.9964 = 0.00000324.

We can use Newton-Raphson method. The derivative f’(x) = 2x.

So the next approximation is x1 = x0 - f(x0)/(2x0).

f(x0)=3.24e-6.

x0 is 0.9982.

So delta = 3.24e-6 / (2 * 0.9982) ≈ 3.24e-6 / 1.9964 ≈ 1.623e-6.

So x1 = 0.9982 - 0.000001623 = 0.998198377.

So x1 squared is (0.998198377)^2. Let's compute this.

0.9982 * 0.9982 = 0.99640324.

But with x1 being 0.998198377, which is 0.9982 minus 0.000001623.

So x1^2 = (0.9982 - 1.623e-6)^2 = 0.9982^2 - 2 * 0.9982 * 1.623e-6 + (1.623e-6)^2.

Which is 0.99640324 - (2 * 0.9982 * 1.623e-6 ) = 0.99640324 - (3.23e-6) ) = 0.99640001.

Which is very close to 0.9964. So x1 is approximately 0.998198377. So gamma is 1 / x1 ≈ 1 / 0.998198377.

Compute 1 / 0.998198377. Let me compute 1 divided by 0.998198377.

Again, using approximation, since 0.998198377 is close to 1. Let me write it as 1 - delta, where delta = 1 - 0.998198377 = 0.001801623.

So 1/(1 - delta) ≈ 1 + delta + delta² + ... for small delta.

So 1/(0.998198377) ≈ 1 + 0.001801623 + (0.001801623)^2 + ... 

Compute 0.001801623 squared: approx (0.0018)^2=3.24e-6.

So the approximation is 1 + 0.001801623 + 0.00000324 = 1.00180486.

So gamma is approximately 1.00180486.

So gamma -1 is approximately 0.00180486.

So now, let's compute (gamma -1) * m c^2.

m c^2 is 8.1983436e-14 J.

So 0.00180486 * 8.1983436e-14 = ?

Compute 0.00180486 * 8.1983436e-14.

0.0018 * 8.1983436e-14 = 1.4758e-16 J.

But let me compute it more accurately.

0.00180486 * 8.1983436e-14 = ?

Let me compute 0.0018 *8.1983436e-14 = 1.4758e-16.

Then, the remaining 0.00000486 *8.1983436e-14 = 4.86e-5 *8.1983436e-14 = 3.98e-18. So total is 1.4758e-16 + 3.98e-18 = approx 1.476e-16 J.

So K = 1.476e-16 J.

Now, V = K/e = 1.476e-16 / 1.602176634e-19.

Compute that: (1.476 / 1.602176634) * 1e3.

1.476 / 1.602176634. Let's compute this division.

1.602176634 goes into 1.476 how many times?

1.602176634 * 0.922 = ?

0.9 * 1.602... is 1.4418.

0.02 * 1.602... is 0.03204.

So 0.922 * 1.602176634 ≈ 1.4418 + 0.03204 + (0.002 * 1.602..) = 1.4418 + 0.03204= 1.47384, and 0.002 * 1.602 is 0.003204, so total 1.47384 + 0.003204 = 1.47704.

So 0.922 * 1.602176634 = approx 1.47704.

But our numerator is 1.476, which is a bit less than 1.47704, so the actual value is approximately 0.922 - a little.

So let's compute 1.476 / 1.602176634.

Let me compute this more accurately.

Let me write 1.476 ÷ 1.602176634.

Let me set up the division: 1.476 ÷ 1.602176634.

I can compute this as:

1.476 / 1.602176634 ≈ let's compute 1.476 / 1.602176634.

Using a calculator approach:

1.602176634 * 0.922 = 1.477044.

But 1.476 is 1.477044 - 0.001044.

So 0.922 * 1.602176634 = 1.477044.

So to get 1.476, we need to subtract 0.001044 from 1.477044, which is 0.922 * 1.602176634.

So the difference is 0.001044.

We can find how much to subtract from 0.922 to get the correct multiplier.

Let me compute the
