Question:

What prevents the stomach from being digested by itsown secretions?

Options:

A: A thick layer of fat surrounds the stomach, providing protection from digestive acids.
B: Special bacteria in the stomach neutralize all digestive enzymes.
C: The stomach lining secretes an alkaline substance that counteracts the acid and prevents digestion.
D: The lining of the stomach secretes only hydrochloric acid and gastric juice.
E: The mucus layer, the permeability of the membranes and the continual replacement of the cells comprising the lining all help protect the underlying tissues from the action of proteolytic enzymes of the stomach and duodenum.
F: The stomach is coated with a layer of strong antibiotics that kill digestive enzymes.
G: The stomach lining is replaced every 10 to 15 days.
H: The stomach has a high permeability to hydrogen ions.
I: The stomach has a unique pH that prevents enzymes from being active.
J: Digestive enzymes in the stomach are only activated by food, so they do not attack the stomach lining.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about why the stomach doesn't get digested by its own secretions. Hmm, I remember from biology class that the stomach produces a lot of digestive enzymes and acids, right? So how does it protect itself from being eaten away?

Let me think about the options. Option A says there's a thick layer of fat. I don't think that's right. The stomach isn't surrounded by fat like some organs might be. Plus, fat wouldn't really stop the digestive juices.

Option B mentions special bacteria neutralizing enzymes. Wait, I recall that the stomach has an acidic environment, which actually kills most bacteria. So I don't think B is correct either.

Option C suggests the stomach lining secretes an alkaline substance. Oh, wait, the stomach lining does produce mucus, which is alkaline. That makes sense because it would neutralize the acid, preventing the stomach from digesting itself. But I'm not sure if that's the only factor.

Option D says the lining only secretes HCl and gastric juice. That doesn't seem right because the question is about protection, not the secretions themselves.

Option E talks about a mucus layer, membrane permeability, and cell replacement. I've heard that the stomach lining has a thick mucus layer that protects it. Also, the epithelial cells are tightly packed, so the acid can't get through. Plus, the cells are replaced quickly if they do get damaged. So E combines multiple factors. That sounds plausible.

Option F says antibiotics coat the stomach. No, I don't think the stomach uses antibiotics. That's more of an external thing, and the body doesn't produce antibiotics naturally for this purpose.

Option G mentions the lining being replaced every 10-15 days. That's true, the stomach lining does regenerate quickly, but is that the main reason? I think it's part of the answer but maybe not the entire story.

Option H says high permeability to hydrogen ions. Wait, high permeability would mean the ions pass through easily, which might not help. The stomach lining is supposed to be impermeable to the acid it produces, so H might be the opposite.

Option I states the stomach has a unique pH preventing enzyme activity. But the stomach's pH is actually very acidic, which is why the enzymes work. So the enzymes are active there, so I doesn't make sense.

Option J claims enzymes are only activated by food. I'm not sure about this. I think the digestive enzymes are active once they're in the stomach, but maybe they're produced in an inactive form and only activated when needed. Oh wait, like pepsinogen is activated by HCl. So in that case, maybe when there's no food, they're inactive. But I'm not certain if that's the primary protective mechanism.

Putting it all together, the main protections are the mucus layer, the tight junctions in the epithelium (which relates to membrane permeability), and the quick replacement of cells. So option E seems to cover all these aspects. Also, option C is about alkaline substance, which is part of it, but E includes more mechanisms.

So the answer should be E.

The stomach is protected from its own digestive secretions through multiple mechanisms. The stomach lining secretes a thick mucus layer that acts as a physical barrier against digestive acids and enzymes. Additionally, the epithelial cells in the stomach lining are tightly packed, preventing the permeation of hydrogen ions and digestive enzymes. Another protective factor is the continual and rapid replacement of the stomach lining cells, which ensures that any damaged cells are quickly regenerated. These combined mechanisms effectively prevent the stomach from being digested by its own secretions.

The correct answer is **E**.
