Okay, I need to figure out which of the options is not a valid circumstance for an arrest without a warrant. Let's think through each option one by one.

First, I remember that arrests without a warrant are generally allowed in specific situations. The main ones are when a felony is committed, or when a misdemeanor is committed in the officer's presence, especially if it's a breach of peace. Also, if the officer has probable cause for a felony, even if it's not in their presence, they can make an arrest.

Looking at option A: An officer may arrest for a misdemeanor that's not a breach of peace and committed out of their presence. Wait, I think that's not allowed. Because for misdemeanors, the officer usually needs to have seen it happen, especially if it's not a breach of peace. So if it's not a breach and not in their presence, they can't arrest without a warrant. Hmm, so A might be the incorrect circumstance.

Option B says an officer must have probable cause for a felony. That makes sense. Probable cause is required for any arrest, so B is a valid circumstance.

Option C: Arrest for a misdemeanor committed in their presence without evidence. Well, if it's in their presence, maybe they don't need evidence because they witnessed it. So C seems okay.

Option D: Arresting someone suspected of a misdemeanor not yet occurred. That sounds like it's about future crimes. I don't think officers can arrest someone just for a future misdemeanor. Arrests are for crimes that have already happened, right? So D might not be valid. Wait, but I thought maybe for imminent crimes, but I'm not sure. I'll come back to this.

Option E: Arrest for a felony regardless of presence. If the officer has probable cause, they can arrest even if they didn't see the felony. So E is correct.

Option F: Suspecting someone will commit a felony in the future. I think this relates to preventive arrests, but without a warrant, I don't think that's allowed. Officers can't arrest based on future crimes unless there's an imminent threat, but generally, you can't arrest someone just for a suspicion they might commit a crime. So F is probably not a valid circumstance.

Option G: A misdemeanor occurred and officer believes the person did it. If it's a breach of peace, maybe, but if it's not in their presence, then without a warrant, I'm not sure. Wait, G says it's a misdemeanor that occurred, and the officer believes the person did it. But does that mean in their presence? The option doesn't specify. If it's not in presence, then maybe G isn't a valid circumstance. Hmm.

Option H: Misdemeanor breach of peace in presence. That's definitely a valid arrest without warrant. So H is correct.

Option I: Arrest based on an unverified tip. I think this is tricky. An unverified tip might not provide probable cause. Officers need reliable information, so if the source is unverified, maybe it's not enough. So I could be a wrong circumstance.

Option J: Arrest for a felony in their presence. That's definitely valid, so J is correct.

Now, going back to the options, the question is which is NOT a valid circumstance. Let me list which options are invalid.

Option A: Misdemeanor not breach of peace and out of presence. I think this is invalid because for misdemeanors, they usually need to be in presence, especially if not breach of peace.

Option D: Suspected future misdemeanor. Arrests can't be made for future crimes, so D is invalid.

Option F: Future felony suspicion. Also invalid, as you can't arrest for future crimes without more.

Option G: If the misdemeanor isn't in presence and not breach of peace, then G is invalid.

Option I: Unverified source. If the tip isn't reliable, then no probable cause, so I is invalid.

Wait, the question is to find the one that is NOT a valid circumstance.

Looking back, the options are:

A: Misdemeanor not breach of peace and not in presence. I think this is invalid because you can't arrest without a warrant in that case.

D: Suspected future misdemeanor. Definitely invalid.

F: Suspected future felony. Also invalid.

G: If the misdemeanor happened but not in presence and not breach of peace, then without a warrant, you can't arrest. So G might be invalid.

Wait, the question is which is NOT one of the circumstances where an arrest can be made without a warrant.

So which option is not a valid exception.

Looking through, the correct circumstances for warrantless arrest are:

- Felony, whether in presence or not, as long as probable cause.

- Misdemeanor committed in presence, especially breach of peace.

- Exigent circumstances (like hot pursuit).

- When an officer has probable cause, even without a warrant.

Now, looking at each option:

Option D: Suspected of committing a misdemeanor that hasn't happened yet. That's pre-crime, so arrest without warrant isn't allowed. So D is invalid.

Option F: Suspected to commit a felony in future. Same issue, can't arrest without a warrant for future crimes.

Option A: Misdemeanor not breach of peace and not in presence. So both conditions are bad. So you can't arrest without a warrant. So A is invalid.

Option G: Misdemeanor occurred, officer believes person did it. If it's not in presence, then without a warrant, the officer can't arrest unless it's a breach of peace. So if G is a misdemeanor that's not a breach of peace and not in presence, then G is invalid.

Option I: Unverified tip. If the tip is from an unverified source, the officer might not have probable cause. So I is invalid.

Now, the question is which option is not a circumstance where arrest can be made without a warrant.

So, the question is which option is NOT allowed.

The options are:

The incorrect ones (invalid circumstances) are A, D, F, G, I.

The correct circumstances are B, C, E, H, J.

So the question is, which option is not a valid circumstance.

Looking at the options, the question is which one is not allowed. So the correct answer is the one that is not a valid circumstance.

Let me go back to each option:

Option D: Arrest for a future misdemeanor. No, not allowed.

Option F: Future felony. No, not allowed.

Option A: Misdemeanor not present and not breach. No.

Option G: If the misdemeanor is not in presence and not breach, then G is invalid.

Option I: If tip is unverified, maybe no probable cause. So I is invalid.

So which of these is the correct answer to the question.

The question is: which is NOT one of those circumstances where arrest may be made without a warrant.

So the answer should be one of the invalid options.

Looking at the options:

Option D: Suspected of committing a misdemeanor that hasn't happened yet. So that's not a valid circumstance.

Option F: Suspected to commit a felony in the future. Also not valid.

Option A: Misdemeanor not breach, not in presence. Not valid.

Option G: Misdemeanor occurred, not in presence, not breach. Not valid.

Option I: Unverified tip. Maybe not enough for probable cause.

Wait, the options are about what is NOT a valid circumstance.

So among the options, the correct answer is the one that is not allowed.

The question is which one is NOT a circumstance where an arrest can be made without a warrant.

Looking back, the correct answer is either D, F, A, G, or I.

Wait, I think the correct answer is option D: An officer may arrest a person if they are suspected of committing a misdemeanor that has not yet occurred.

Because you can't arrest someone for a future crime. Arrests are for crimes that have already been committed. So D is not a valid circumstance.

Similarly, F is about future felony, which is also invalid.

But looking at the options, the question is which is not a circumstance where arrest may be made without a warrant.

So, the answer would be D because you can't arrest for a future misdemeanor.

Wait, but another option is F, which is about future felony. So which one is the correct answer.

Wait, the question is which is NOT one of the circumstances where an arrest may be made without a warrant.

Looking back, I think the correct answer is D and F are both invalid, but the options only allow one correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps option F is also invalid, but the question provides options, and I have to choose which one is not allowed.

Wait, the options are:

The question is about which is NOT a valid circumstance. So the correct answer is the option that is not allowed.

Another approach: which options are valid?

Valid circumstances for warrantless arrest:

1. Felony (whether in presence or not, as long as probable cause) → B, E, J.

2. Misdemeanor committed in presence (especially breach of peace) → C, H.

3. Probable cause for felony → B.

4. Exigent circumstances, like hot pursuit.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Misdemeanor not a breach of peace and not in presence. Not allowed → invalid.

Option D: Future misdemeanor. Not allowed.

Option F: Future felony. Not allowed.

Option G: Misdemeanor occurred, not in presence, not breach. Not allowed.

Option I: Unverified tip. Not enough for probable cause → invalid.

So the question is which option is not a valid circumstance.

Looking at the options, the question is which one is not allowed.

The correct answer is D: An officer may arrest a person if they are suspected of committing a misdemeanor that has not yet occurred.

Because you cannot arrest someone for a future crime; arrest requires that the crime has been committed.

Similarly, option F is about future felony, which is also invalid. But I need to look at the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: No, because it's not in presence and not breach.

B: Yes, because probable cause for felony.

C: Yes, in presence.

D: No, future crime.

E: Yes, felony arrest.

F: No, future felony.

G: No, if not in presence and not breach.

H: Yes, in presence and breach.

I: No, unless tip is reliable.

J: Yes, felony in presence.

So the options that are invalid are A, D, F, G, I.

The question is which one is not a valid circumstance, so among these, which one is an option presented.

The question is which is NOT one of the circumstances where arrest may be made without a warrant.

So the correct answer is the one that is not allowed.

Looking at the options, D and F are about future crimes. So both are invalid.

But the question gives only one correct answer. So perhaps the intended answer is D or F.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, the question is about which is NOT a valid circumstance.

Looking at the options again:

Option D: Suspected of a misdemeanor that hasn't happened yet. So no, that's not allowed.

Option F: Suspected of a future felony. Also not allowed.

But I think the more direct answer is D. Because for misdemeanors, you can't arrest without a warrant unless in presence. For a future misdemeanor, you can't arrest at all without a warrant, as it hasn't happened.

But the same applies to future felonies. So perhaps both D and F are invalid.

But the question is which is not a circumstance. So the answer would be either D or F.

But looking at the options, perhaps the answer is D.

Wait, the options are:

D: Suspected of committing a misdemeanor that has not yet occurred.

F: Suspected to commit a felony in the future.

So both are about future crimes, but D is a misdemeanor and F is a felony.

In terms of the law, I think that you can't arrest someone for a future crime, whether misdemeanor or felony, without a warrant. So both D and F are invalid.

But the question is which is not a valid circumstance. So the answer would be either D or F.

But looking at the options, perhaps the intended answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is A.

Wait, let me think again about each option.

Option A: An officer may arrest for a misdemeanor that is not a breach of peace and committed out of arresting party's presence.

As I recall, in general, a warrantless arrest for a misdemeanor requires that the offense be committed in the officer's presence. If it's not in presence, and it's not a breach of peace, then the officer cannot make an arrest without a warrant. So A is not a valid circumstance.

So the correct answer is A, because that's not allowed. Wait, but earlier I thought D was the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to list each option and whether it is a valid circumstance.

Option A: Misdemeanor not breach, not in presence → invalid.

Option B: Probable cause for felony → valid.

Option C: Misdemeanor in presence → valid.

Option D: Future misdemeanor → invalid.

Option E: Felony, any presence → valid.

Option F: Future felony → invalid.

Option G: Misdemeanor occurred, not in presence, not breach → invalid.

Option H: Misdemeanor in presence and breach → valid.

Option I: Unverified tip → invalid (no probable cause).

Option J: Felony in presence → valid.

So the invalid options are A, D, F, G, I.

The question is which among the options is not a valid circumstance.

So the correct answer is one of these.

Looking back at the question's options, the correct answer is either A, D, F, G, or I.

Wait, but the question says, which is NOT one of the circumstances. So the correct answer is one of these.

In the context of the question, the options are:

The correct answer is the option that is NOT allowed.

So, looking at the options, the answer should be either A, D, F, G, or I.

But the question provides options A through J, and the correct answer is the one that is not a valid circumstance.

Now, looking at the possible answers, I think the intended answer is option A. Because it's about a misdemeanor not in presence and not breach of peace, which is not a valid circumstance for warrantless arrest.

Wait, but I'm also considering option D, which is about a future crime. So perhaps that's more clearly invalid.

But I think the answer is D. Because you can't arrest someone for a crime that hasn't happened yet. It's a violation of due process.

So between A and D, I'm a bit torn.

Wait, let's think about what each option says.

Option D: Suspected of committing a misdemeanor that has not yet occurred.

Therefore, the crime hasn't happened. So you can't arrest someone for a crime that hasn't occurred. So D is not a valid circumstance.

Similarly, option F is about a future felony, which is also invalid.

But the question is which one is not a valid circumstance. So both D and F are invalid, but the question expects one answer.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F.

But I'm not entirely sure. I think the most straightforward invalid option is D, because it's about a future misdemeanor, which hasn't happened. So the answer is D.

Wait, but some sources say that warrantless arrests are only for completed crimes, so both D and F are invalid.

But the question is which is not a valid circumstance. So perhaps the intended answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is A.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to find the correct answer.

The key is to know which of these options is not a valid exception to the warrant requirement.

Arrests without a warrant are allowed:

- For felonies, as long as there's probable cause (whether the officer saw it or not).

- For misdemeanors committed in the officer's presence (especially breaches of peace).

So, looking at the options:

Option A: Misdemeanor not in presence and not breach of peace → invalid. So it's not a valid circumstance.

Option D: Future misdemeanor → invalid.

Option F: Future felony → invalid.

Option I: Unverified tip, no probable cause → invalid.

So the answer is either A, D, F, or I.

The question is which is not a valid circumstance.

Now, I recall that an officer cannot arrest for a future crime. So both D and F are invalid.

But the options are separate, so the question is which one is presented.

Looking at the options, the answer is either D or F.

But I think the intended answer is D.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D. Because it's about a future misdemeanor, which hasn't occurred.

Yes, I think that's the case. So the answer is D.

To determine which option is not a valid circumstance for an arrest without a warrant, we analyze each option based on the legal standards for warrantless arrests. Warrantless arrests are generally allowed in specific situations, such as when a felony is committed, a misdemeanor is committed in the officer's presence (especially if it is a breach of peace), or when there is probable cause for a felony. Arrests for future crimes or crimes not yet committed are not permitted.

### Analysis of Each Option:
- **A**: An officer may arrest for a misdemeanor that is not a breach of peace and committed out of the arresting party's presence.  
  - **Invalid**: Warrantless arrests for misdemeanors require the offense to be committed in the officer's presence, especially if it is not a breach of peace.

- **B**: An officer must have probable cause that a felony has occurred and that the arrested person committed it.  
  - **Valid**: Probable cause is a sufficient basis for a warrantless arrest in felony cases.

- **C**: An officer may arrest for a misdemeanor committed in their presence without any evidence.  
  - **Valid**: Misdemeanors committed in the officer's presence are a valid basis for a warrantless arrest.

- **D**: An officer may arrest a person if they are suspected of committing a misdemeanor that has not yet occurred.  
  - **Invalid**: Arrests cannot be made for future crimes, as the offense must have already occurred.

- **E**: An officer may arrest a person if they have committed a felony, regardless of the officer's presence during the crime.  
  - **Valid**: Probable cause for a felony is sufficient for a warrantless arrest, even if the officer did not witness it.

- **F**: An officer may arrest if he suspects a person will commit a felony in the future.  
  - **Invalid**: Similar to D, arrests for future crimes are not permitted.

- **G**: A misdemeanor has occurred, and an officer must believe that the person he has arrested committed it.  
  - **Invalid**: If the misdemeanor was not committed in the officer's presence and is not a breach of peace, a warrantless arrest is not allowed.

- **H**: An officer may arrest for a misdemeanor that is a breach of peace and committed in the arresting party's presence.  
  - **Valid**: Misdemeanors
