Okay, so I've got this problem about a calculator's list price and a trade discount, and I need to find the percentage of the discount. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

Alright, the list price is $10.00. That's the original price before any discounts. The seller is offering a $4.00 trade discount. Wait, what exactly is a trade discount? I think it's a reduction in the price given to certain buyers, like wholesalers or retailers, to trade. So it's like a bulk purchase discount or something like that.

So the question is asking for the percentage of the discount. Right, so I need to calculate what percentage $4.00 is of the original list price. Because the discount is a part of the original price, the percentage will tell me how much of the original price is being discounted.

Let me remember the formula for percentage discount. I think it's (Discount Amount / Original Price) * 100. Yeah, that sounds right. So applying that here, the discount amount is $4.00, and the original price is $10.00.

So plugging in the numbers: (4.00 / 10.00) * 100. Let's do the math. 4 divided by 10 is 0.4. Multiply that by 100 gives 40%. So the discount is 40%.

Wait, let me double-check. If the original price is $10 and the discount is $4, then the selling price becomes $6. So $4 off of $10 is indeed 40% off. Yep, that makes sense.

Looking at the options, option F is 40%. So the correct answer should be F.

The list price of the calculator is $10.00, and the trade discount offered is $4.00. To find the percentage of the discount, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage Discount} = \left( \frac{\text{Discount Amount}}{\text{Original Price}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{Percentage Discount} = \left( \frac{4.00}{10.00} \right) \times 100 = 0.4 \times 100 = 40\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of the discount is 40%, which corresponds to option F.

F
