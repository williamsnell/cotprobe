Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about how changes in taxes affect national income, specifically when income taxes are increased versus when sales taxes are increased. Let me start by breaking down what I know.

So the question states that households consume 85% of their disposable income. That means the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is 0.85. I remember that MPC is the fraction of additional income that a household consumes rather than saves. So if they get an extra dollar, they spend 85 cents and save 15 cents.

The initial tax rate is 20% in both cases. Now, the taxes are being increased by 4%, so the new tax rate would be 24% in each scenario. But wait, I think the effect of income taxes versus sales taxes might be different. Hmm, why is that?

Let me think about income taxes first. Income taxes are levied on income. So when income taxes increase, the disposable income (after-tax income) decreases. People have less money to spend or save. Since MPC is 0.85, when disposable income drops, consumption will drop by 0.85 times the change in disposable income. 

Wait, but how does this affect national income? I remember something about the multiplier effect. The tax increase would reduce disposable income, which reduces consumption, which in turn reduces aggregate demand and thus national income. So the change in taxes leads to a change in income, but because of the multiplier, the effect is larger.

Then, what about sales taxes? Sales taxes are levied on spending. So when sales taxes increase, the cost of goods goes up. But wait, how does that affect disposable income? If sales taxes go up by 4%, that means for each dollar someone wants to spend, 4% goes to taxes. So the purchasing power of disposable income decreases. 

But wait, do I treat this the same as an income tax increase? Or is there a different effect? Because with sales taxes, people might adjust their spending differently. Oh, I think in this context, the effect on consumption would be similar because the MPC is given based on disposable income. So whether the tax is on income or on sales, the impact on the amount available for consumption is similar.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me model this. Let's say there's an increase in income tax. If income taxes go up by 4%, disposable income decreases. Let me denote Y as national income, T as taxes. So initially, T is 20% of income. If it increases by 4%, T becomes 24%. So the change in taxes is 4% of Y, which is a ΔT = 0.04Y. Wait, but actually, taxes are a percentage of income, so when we increase the rate, the tax collected increases. 

But wait, the way taxes affect disposable income is through Yd = Y - T. So when the tax rate increases by 4 percentage points, the new T is higher. So the change in T is (24% - 20%)Y = 0.04Y. So the change in disposable income is -0.04Y. But wait, that's a one-time change. However, because of the multiplier effect, the total effect on Y is more than that.

Wait a second, no. The multiplier effect comes into play because the reduction in disposable income leads to a reduction in consumption, which reduces income further. So the initial change is a reduction in disposable income, which reduces consumption, which reduces Y, leading to a further reduction in T (but wait, no, because T is now at a higher rate). Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the balanced budget multiplier theorem, but I'm not sure that's applicable here because we aren't talking about government spending, just tax changes.

Let me approach it step by step.

First, for the income tax increase:

1. The government increases income tax by 4 percentage points, from 20% to 24%.
2. Disposable income Yd = Y(1 - tax rate). So the tax increase reduces Yd.
3. The change in Yd is Y*(new tax rate - old tax rate) = Y*(0.24-0.20) = 0.04Y. Wait, no, that's the absolute change in tax revenue, not the change in Yd. Wait, perhaps I should model it differently.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the change in taxes as a change in tax rate, and see how that affects disposable income and then consumption.

Let me denote the initial tax rate as t = 0.20. An increase of 4 percentage points would make t = 0.24.

The change in taxes is Δt = 0.04. So for every dollar of income, taxes go up by 0.04 dollars.

So the disposable income Yd = Y(1 - t). The change in disposable income is ΔYd = Y*(1 - t_new) - Y*(1 - t_old) = Y*(1 - 0.24) - Y*(0.80) = Y*(0.76 - 0.80) = -0.04Y. So disposable income decreases by 0.04Y.

But wait, that can't be right because Y itself is the national income, which is also affected by the tax change. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up cause and effect here. Let me think in terms of equilibrium.

The national income Y is equal to aggregate demand, which is C + I + G + (X - M). But since we're dealing with taxes and consumption, perhaps the model is simpler. Let's consider a simple model where Y = C + G, ignoring investment and foreign trade for simplicity, and assuming G is given.

Wait, but the question is about the effect of tax changes when the initial tax rate is 20%. So perhaps I should model this as a change in autonomous taxes. Let's think about the impact on equilibrium income.

In the case of income taxes, the tax increase reduces disposable income, which reduces consumption. The reduction in consumption leads to a reduction in Y. But because of the MPC, the reduction is multiplied.

The formula for the change in equilibrium Y when taxes change is:

ΔY = (ΔT) * (1/MPS), but wait, I might have that backwards. Alternatively, the tax multiplier is (1/MPS), but since taxes affect disposable income, the multiplier would be the same as the spending multiplier.

Wait, the tax multiplier is actually (MPC)/(1 - MPC). Wait, no, the tax multiplier is the change in Y divided by the change in T. When taxes increase, disposable income decreases, leading to a decrease in consumption. The initial change is a decrease in disposable income of ΔT, which leads to a decrease in consumption of MPC * ΔT, which then affects Y. So the total change in Y would be (MPC/(1 - MPC)) * ΔT.

Wait, let me think again. The initial change is that taxes go up by ΔT = 4% of income, which is 0.04Y. So disposable income Yd decreases by 0.04Y. Then, consumption decreases by MPC * ΔYd = 0.85 * (-0.04Y) = -0.034Y. But wait, because Y itself is changing, this is an iterative process. So the total change in Y is the initial change in consumption times the multiplier.

Alternatively, the tax multiplier is (MPC)/(1 - MPC). Wait, no, the standard tax multiplier is actually (1)/(1 - MPC), but for taxes, it's different. Alternatively, I might be mixing up the formulas.

Wait, let me get this straight. The government spending multiplier is (1/(1 - MPC)) because an increase in G increases Y by that factor. The tax multiplier is (MPC/(1 - MPC)) because a change in taxes affects disposable income, which then affects consumption.

So if taxes increase by ΔT, disposable income decreases by ΔT, consumption decreases by MPC * ΔT, which reduces Y, which reduces taxes further (if taxes are a percentage of income), but wait, in this problem, the tax rate is increased, not the absolute tax. Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the initial change and then apply the multiplier.

In the case of income taxes:

1. Tax rate increases by 4%, so the tax T goes up. The change in T is 0.04Y, assuming Y is the national income.

2. Disposable income Yd = Y - T decreases by 0.04Y.

3. Consumption C = 0.85 Yd. So the change in C is 0.85 * (change in Yd) = 0.85 * (-0.04Y) = -0.034Y.

But this is the first-round effect. The total effect is calculated using the multiplier. The multiplier here is 1/(1 - MPC) = 1/(0.15) ≈ 6.6667.

Wait, but wait, the tax change leads to a change in C, which then changes Y, which changes T again, but since the tax rate has increased, T is now a higher percentage of Y.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to model the change in equilibrium Y when the tax rate increases.

Let me try setting up the equations.

In equilibrium, Y = C + G.

C = MPC * Yd = 0.85(Y - T).

T = t * Y, where t is the tax rate.

So substituting, Y = 0.85(Y - tY) + G.

Simplify:

Y = 0.85Y(1 - t) + G.

Let me rearrange this:

Y - 0.85(1 - t)Y = G.

Y [1 - 0.85(1 - t)] = G.

So Y = G / [1 - 0.85(1 - t)].

Now, when the tax rate t increases by 4 percentage points (from 0.20 to 0.24), how does Y change?

Let me compute Y before and after the tax increase.

Initial t = 0.20.

Y_initial = G / [1 - 0.85*(1 - 0.20)].

Compute denominator: 1 - 0.85*(0.80) = 1 - 0.68 = 0.32.

So Y_initial = G / 0.32 = 3.125 G.

After tax increase, t = 0.24.

Y_final = G / [1 - 0.85*(1 - 0.24)].

Compute denominator: 1 - 0.85*(0.76) = 1 - 0.646 = 0.354.

So Y_final = G / 0.354 ≈ 2.824 G.

So the change in Y is from 3.125 G to approximately 2.824 G.

The change in Y is (2.824 - 3.125)/3.125 * 100 ≈ (-0.301/3.125)*100 ≈ -9.63%.

Wait, that's approximately a 9.6% decrease. But looking at the options, I don't see exactly that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to compute the percentage change in Y.

Alternatively, using the tax multiplier formula. The tax multiplier is (MPC)/(1 - MPC) = 0.85/(1 - 0.85) = 0.85/0.15 ≈ 5.6667.

But when taxes increase, the effect on Y is a decrease. So the change in Y would be (-ΔT) * (MPC/(1 - MPC)).

Wait, but ΔT is the change in taxes. If the tax rate increases by 4 percentage points, the change in taxes is ΔT = 0.04 Y.

So the change in Y would be ΔY = (-ΔT) * (MPC/(1 - MPC)).

Plugging in the numbers: ΔY = (-0.04 Y) * (0.85/0.15) = (-0.04) * 5.6667 Y ≈ -0.2267 Y, which is a decrease of approximately 22.67%. But that seems higher than what I calculated earlier.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between tax rate changes and absolute tax changes. Let me clarify.

In the formula, the tax multiplier applies when there's a change in lump-sum taxes (like a tax that's a fixed amount, not a percentage). But in this question, the tax rate changes, so the approach might be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to model the change in the tax rate and see how it affects Y.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about sales taxes now.

For sales taxes, the approach is similar but the impact is on the cost of goods. So when sales taxes increase by 4%, the price of goods effectively increases by 4%. This makes consumers' disposable income worth less in terms of purchasing power.

But wait, disposable income is in terms of money, not purchasing power. So a 4% increase in sales tax would mean that for every dollar of disposable income, only part can be used for consumption after tax. So the effective disposable income after sales tax would be Yd/(1 + sales tax rate).

But wait, in terms of real disposable income, it's as if Yd is reduced. So a 4% increase in sales tax would make the effective Yd = Yd / 1.04.

So the change in effective Yd is a decrease of approximately (1/1.04 - 1) ≈ -0.0385, or about 3.85% decrease.

Then, the change in consumption would be MPC * change in effective Yd = 0.85 * (-0.0385 Yd). But wait, since Yd is after income tax, perhaps this approach is getting too tangled.

Alternatively, perhaps the effect of a sales tax is similar to an income tax in terms of reducing the amount consumers can spend, so the impact on consumption is the same as an income tax increase leading to the same reduction in disposable income.

Wait, but in the case of income tax, the reduction in disposable income is direct. In sales tax, the reduction is through higher prices, so real disposable income decreases.

So whether it's income tax or sales tax, the effect on consumption is through the same MPC. So the impact on Y would be the same in both cases. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the options suggest different effects.

Wait, looking at the options, for example, option H says income falls by 9.9% with income tax and 12.4% with sales tax. So they're different.

Hmm, so perhaps the way the taxes affect Yd is different. Let me think again.

In the case of income tax:

- An increase in income tax rate reduces disposable income directly. So the change in Yd is ΔYd = - (Δt) Y, but then Y itself is affected.

In the case of sales tax:

- An increase in sales tax makes each unit of currency less valuable in terms of purchasing goods. So the real disposable income is Yd / (1 + sales_tax_rate). So a 4% increase in sales tax would reduce real Yd by approximately 4%/ (1 + 0.04) ≈ 3.85%.

Wait, but the initial Yd is Y(1 - t). So with a higher sales tax, the real Yd becomes Y(1 - t)/(1 + s), where s is the sales tax rate.

So the change in real Yd when sales tax increases by 4% (from 20% to 24%?) Wait, no, the initial tax rate is 20% for both. Wait, no, the initial tax rate is 20%, and then it's increased by 4 percentage points, making it 24% in each case. So for sales tax, the rate becomes 24%.

So the real Yd would be Y(1 - 0.20)/(1 + 0.24) = Y * 0.80 / 1.24 ≈ Y * 0.6452.

Compare that to the initial real Yd when sales tax was 20%: Y * 0.80 / 1.20 ≈ Y * 0.6667.

So the change in real Yd is from 0.6667 Y to 0.6452 Y, a decrease of approximately 0.0215 Y, or 3.2% decrease.

Then, the change in consumption would be 0.85 * (-0.0215 Y) ≈ -0.0183 Y.

But again, this is just the first-round effect. The total effect would involve the multiplier.

Wait, but perhaps I should model both cases using the multiplier formula.

For the income tax increase:

The change in disposable income is ΔYd = Y (1 - t_new) - Y (1 - t_old) = Y (0.76 - 0.80) = -0.04 Y.

Then, the change in consumption is MPC * ΔYd = 0.85 * (-0.04 Y) = -0.034 Y.

The total change in Y would be (change in consumption) / (1 - MPC) = (-0.034 Y) / 0.15 ≈ -0.2267 Y, which is a 22.67% decrease. But that seems too high, and none of the options match that. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider the tax multiplier formula. The tax multiplier is (MPC) / (1 - MPC). So with MPC=0.85, the tax multiplier is 0.85 / 0.15 ≈ 5.6667.

But when taxes increase, the effect on Y is negative. So the change in Y is (ΔT) * (MPC / (1 - MPC)).

But wait, ΔT is the change in taxes. If the tax rate increases by 4 percentage points, then ΔT = 0.04 Y. So the change in Y would be ΔY = (0.04 Y) * (0.85 / 0.15) * (-1), since higher taxes decrease Y.

So ΔY = -0.04 * 5.6667 Y ≈ -0.2267 Y, which is a 22.67% decrease in Y. But looking at the options, the closest is option H with 9.9% and 12.4%, or option J with 12.4% and 9.9%. So I'm not matching any options here.

Wait, perhaps I'm not applying the correct formula. Another approach: when taxes increase, the initial impact is a reduction in consumption. Let me model this as a decrease in autonomous consumption.

Wait, another way: the initial change in disposable income is a decrease of 0.04 Y (from the 4% tax increase). This leads to a decrease in consumption of 0.85 * 0.04 Y = 0.034 Y. This decrease in consumption leads
