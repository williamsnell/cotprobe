Okay, so I have this math problem here where I need to find the value of f(-2) for the function f(x) = 8x³ - 6x² - 4x + 5. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, I remember that to evaluate a function at a specific value, I just substitute that value into the function wherever there's an x. So for f(-2), I replace every x in the equation with -2.

Let me write that out step by step. The function is 8x cubed minus 6x squared minus 4x plus 5. So substituting x with -2, each term becomes:

First term: 8*(-2)³
Second term: -6*(-2)²
Third term: -4*(-2)
Fourth term: +5

Wait, I should be careful with the exponents because it's easy to make a mistake with negative signs. Let's compute each term one by one.

Starting with the first term: 8*(-2)³. The exponent applies only to -2, right? So (-2) cubed is (-2) * (-2) * (-2). Let me calculate that. 

-2 times -2 is 4, and 4 times -2 is -8. So (-2)^3 is -8. Multiply that by 8: 8*(-8) = -64. Okay, so the first term is -64.

Next, the second term: -6*(-2)². Again, the exponent comes first. (-2) squared is (-2)*(-2) which is 4. So now it's -6 * 4. What's that? -6*4 is -24. So the second term is -24.

Wait, no, wait a second. Oh right, the term is -6 times (the square of -2). So yeah, (-2)^2 is 4, multiplied by -6 gives -24.

Third term: -4*(-2). That's straightforward. Multiplying two negatives gives a positive. So -4 times -2 is 8. So the third term is +8.

Fourth term is just +5, so that's easy.

Now, I'll add all these computed terms together. Let's list them again:

First term: -64
Second term: -24
Third term: +8
Fourth term: +5

Adding them up step by step. Let's start with the first two terms: -64 + (-24) is the same as subtracting 24 from -64. So that would be -88.

Now add the third term, which is +8. So -88 +8 equals -80.

Then add the fourth term, which is +5. So -80 +5 is -75.

Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes signs can be tricky.

Let me recompute each term:

First term: 8*(-2)^3. (-2)^3 is -8. 8*(-8) is indeed -64.

Second term: -6*(-2)^2. (-2)^2 is 4. So -6*4 is -24.

Third term: -4*(-2) is 8.

Fourth term is 5.

So adding: (-64) + (-24) = -88. Then, -88 +8 is -80. Then, -80 +5 is -75. So the result should be -75.

Looking at the options, option I is -75. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I should try another approach. Let me substitute x = -2 into the function again and compute each term again.

f(-2) = 8*(-2)^3 -6*(-2)^2 -4*(-2) +5.

Compute each exponent first:

(-2)^3 = -8.

(-2)^2 = 4.

So substituting:

8*(-8) = -64.

-6*(4) = -24.

-4*(-2) = 8.

Adding all terms: -64 -24 +8 +5.

Let me add them in order. -64 -24 is -88. Then +8 brings it to -80. Then +5 makes it -75. Yep, same result.

So the answer is -75, which is option I.

To find the value of \( f(-2) \) for the function \( f(x) = 8x^3 - 6x^2 - 4x + 5 \), substitute \( x = -2 \) into the function and compute each term:

1. **First term**: \( 8(-2)^3 \)  
   \[
   (-2)^3 = -8 \quad \text{and} \quad 8(-8) = -64
   \]

2. **Second term**: \( -6(-2)^2 \)  
   \[
   (-2)^2 = 4 \quad \text{and} \quad -6(4) = -24
   \]

3. **Third term**: \( -4(-2) \)  
   \[
   -4(-2) = 8
   \]

4. **Fourth term**: \( +5 \)  
   This remains constant.

Now, add all the terms together:  
\[
-64 + (-24) + 8 + 5 = -64 - 24 + 8 + 5 = -88 + 8 + 5 = -80 + 5 = -75
\]

Thus, the value of \( f(-2) \) is \( -75 \), which corresponds to option **I**.
