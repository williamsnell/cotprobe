Okay, so Mrs. Ash wants to set up a savings account for her daughter's education. She needs to figure out how much she should deposit annually for 17 years at a 5% interest rate to get $20,000. Hmm, I remember this has something to do with compound interest, but I'm not exactly sure which formula to use here. Let me think.

Wait, I think when you're making regular payments to reach a future value, it's called an annuity. So the formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity is probably needed here. The formula is FV = PMT × [(1 + r)^n - 1]/r. Right, because each payment earns interest over time.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The formula uses the periodic payment PMT, the interest rate per period r, and the number of periods n. So in this case, Mrs. Ash is making annual deposits, so each period is a year. The rate is 5%, so that's 0.05. She's doing this for 17 years, so n is 17.

But wait, she wants the future value to be $20,000. So the FV is $20,000. We're solving for PMT, the annual payment.

So rearranging the formula, PMT = FV × r / [(1 + r)^n - 1]. Let me plug in the numbers. FV is 20,000. r is 0.05. n is 17.

Let me calculate the denominator first. (1 + 0.05)^17 minus 1. 1.05^17... I'm not exactly sure what that is. Maybe I can approximate it or use logarithms, but that's complicated. Alternatively, I remember that 1.05^17 is about... let me think. Each year it's multiplied by 1.05.

Wait, maybe I can calculate it step by step. Let's see:

1.05^1 = 1.05
1.05^2 = 1.1025
1.05^3 ≈ 1.1576
1.05^4 ≈ 1.2155
1.05^5 ≈ 1.2763
1.05^10 is about 1.6289 (I remember that 1.05^10 is roughly 1.62889)
So 1.05^17 is 1.05^10 * 1.05^7. Let's compute 1.05^7.

1.05^1 = 1.05
1.05^2 = 1.1025
1.05^3 ≈ 1.1576
1.05^4 ≈ 1.2155
1.05^5 ≈ 1.2763
1.05^6 ≈ 1.3401
1.05^7 ≈ 1.4071

So 1.05^17 ≈ 1.6289 * 1.4071. Let's multiply those:

1.6289 * 1.4071 ≈ Let's see, 1.6 * 1.4 is 2.24. But more accurately: 1.6289 * 1.4071. Let me compute it step by step.

1.6289 * 1.4 is approximately 2.28046. Then 1.6289 * 0.0071 is about 0.01157. Adding them together gives approx 2.292. So 1.05^17 ≈ 2.292.

Wait, but wait, I think my approximation might be a bit off. Let me check with a calculator approach. But since I can't use a calculator, I'll proceed as best as I can.

So the denominator is (2.292 - 1) = 1.292.

So PMT = 20,000 * 0.05 / 1.292. Let's compute that.

20,000 * 0.05 is 1,000. So 1,000 / 1.292 ≈ Let's see. 1.292 * 773 is about 773 * 1.292. Hmm, 700 * 1.292 is 907.4, 73 * 1.292 is around 94.3. So total ≈ 1001.7. Oh wait, that's more than 1000. So maybe 773 is a bit high. Wait, but I'm dividing 1000 by 1.292, which is approximately 773.98.

Wait, but wait, in my calculation, I estimated 1.05^17 as 2.292, but I'm not sure if that's accurate. Maybe I should use logarithms to get a better approximation.

Let me try a better approach. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r)^n. But here, it's an annuity, so the formula is different. Alternatively, I can use the present value of an annuity formula, but wait, wait, no, we're calculating the payment needed to reach a future value, so it's the future value of an ordinary annuity.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula in a different way. Let me think, maybe I can use the formula PMT = FV / [((1 + r)^n - 1)/r].

So if I compute (1.05)^17, perhaps a better way to approximate it. Let me compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 1.05^17:

We know that ln(1.05) ≈ 0.04879. So ln(1.05^17) = 17 * 0.04879 ≈ 0.8294. Then e^0.8294 is e^0.8 is about 2.2255, e^0.0294 is approximately 1.0298. So e^0.8294 ≈ 2.2255 * 1.0298 ≈ 2.292, which matches my earlier approximation. So (1.05)^17 ≈ 2.292.

So the denominator is (2.292 - 1) = 1.292. So PMT ≈ (20,000 * 0.05) / 1.292 = 1,000 / 1.292 ≈ 773.98.

Looking at the options, option B is $773.98, which seems to match. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, 1.05^17: another approach is to compute it year by year more accurately, but that's time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe I can use the rule of 72 to estimate doubling time. The rule of 72 says that at 5%, money doubles every ~14.4 years. So in 17 years, it's a bit more than double. So 2 * 1.19 (since after 14.4 it's double, and 17 is 2.6 years more). Wait, but that's for the future value of a single sum, not an annuity. Hmm, perhaps not the best approach here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a more accurate approximation for (1.05)^17. Let me see, I can compute it using the binomial expansion, but that's complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it step by step from 1.05^10 = 1.62889, then 1.05^7.

1.05^7: Let me compute each year.

Year 1: 1.05
Year 2: 1.1025
Year 3: 1.157625
Year 4: 1.21550625
Year 5: 1.2762815625
Year 6: 1.3400956406
Year 7: 1.4071004226

So 1.05^7 ≈ 1.4071004226. Now, 1.05^17 = 1.05^10 * 1.05^7 ≈ 1.628894627 * 1.4071004226. Let's compute that:

1.628894627 * 1.4071004226 = ?

Let me multiply 1.628894627 by 1.4071004226.

First, multiply 1.628894627 by 1.4: 1.628894627 * 1.4 = 2.2804524778.

Then, 1.628894627 * 0.0071004226 ≈ Let's compute 1.628894627 * 0.007 = 0.0114022638, and 1.628894627 * 0.0001004226 ≈ ~0.0001636. So total ≈ 0.0114022638 + 0.0001636 ≈ 0.01156586.

Adding to the 2.2804524778: 2.2804524778 + 0.01156586 ≈ 2.29201833.

So 1.05^17 ≈ 2.29201833.

So the denominator is (2.29201833 - 1) = 1.29201833.

So PMT = (20,000 * 0.05) / 1.29201833 = 1,000 / 1.29201833 ≈ ?

Let me compute 1,000 divided by 1.29201833.

I can write 1.29201833 as approximately 1.292. So 1,000 / 1.292.

Let me compute 1.292 * 773 = ?

1.292 * 700 = 904.4

1.292 * 73 = let's compute 70 * 1.292 = 90.44, 3 * 1.292 = 3.876. So 90.44 + 3.876 = 94.316.

So total is 904.4 + 94.316 = 998.716. So 1.292 * 773 ≈ 998.716, which is just under 1,000. The difference is 1,000 - 998.716 = 1.284.

So how much more do we need to add to 773 to get the exact value? Let's see, 773 + x, where 1.292 * x = 1.284. So x ≈ 1.284 / 1.292 ≈ 0.994. So x ≈ 1. So 773 + 1 = 774. But wait, 1.292 * 773.98 = ?

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to do 1,000 / 1.29201833 = ?

Let me compute this as a division.

1.29201833 × 773.98 = ?

Wait, perhaps I can do it as 1.292 * 773.98. Let me see:

1.292 * 773 = let's compute 773 * 1 =773, 773 * 0.292 = ?

0.292 * 700 = 204.4

0.292 *73= let's compute 70*0.292=20.44, 3*0.292=0.876 → total 21.316.

So 204.4 + 21.316 = 225.716. So 773 * 0.292 = 225.716. So 773 *1.292=773 +225.716=998.716.

Then, 0.98 *1.292= let's compute 0.98 *1.292. 1 *1.292=1.292, minus 0.02*1.292=0.02584 → 1.292-0.02584=1.26616.

So 773.98 *1.292 = 773 *1.292 + 0.98 *1.292 = 998.716 + 1.26616 ≈ 999.98216. Which is almost 1,000. So 773.98 is approximately the correct PMT.

So the annual deposit needed is approximately $773.98, which is option B.
</think>

To determine how much Mrs. Ash needs to deposit annually for 17 years at a 5% interest rate to yield $20,000, we use the formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity:

\[
FV = PMT \times \frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r}
\]

Where:
- \( FV = 20,000 \) (the desired future value),
- \( r = 0.05 \) (the annual interest rate),
- \( n = 17 \) (the number of years),
- \( PMT \) is the annual payment to be calculated.

Rearranging the formula to solve for \( PMT \):

\[
PMT = \frac{FV \times r}{(1 + r)^n - 1}
\]

First, calculate \( (1 + r)^n \), which is \( (1.05)^{17} \). Using approximations and step-by-step calculations:

\[
(1.05)^{17} \approx 2.292
\]

Thus, the denominator becomes:

\[
(1.05)^{17} - 1 = 2.292 - 1 = 1.292
\]

Now, substitute the values into the formula for \( PMT \):

\[
PMT = \frac{20,000 \times 0.05}{1.292} = \frac{1,000}{1.292} \approx 773.98
\]

Therefore, Mrs. Ash needs to deposit approximately **$773.98 annually**. Among the given options, the closest match is:

**B: $773.98**
