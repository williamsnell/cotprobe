Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a coat's price going down twice, and I need to figure out what the final price is in December. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the original list price is $325.00. That's what the coat was initially priced at. Now, in November, the merchant marked it down by 20 percent. Hmm, I remember that a percentage discount means you take that percentage off the original price. So 20% off of $325.

Wait, how do I calculate 20% of 325? Oh right, I can convert 20% to a decimal, which is 0.20, and then multiply that by 325. Let me do that: 0.20 * 325 = 65. So the discount in November is $65. 

Subtracting that from the original price gives the new price after the first markdown. So $325 minus $65 equals $260. So after November, the coat is $260.

But then in December, there's another markdown, this time an additional 10 percent. Oh wait, is this 10 percent off the already discounted price or the original? I think it's off the already discounted price because it's an additional markdown. So the December discount is 10% of $260.

Calculating 10% of 260: 0.10 * 260 = 26. So the discount in December is $26.

Subtracting that from the November price, $260 - $26 gives me $234. So the final price in December would be $234.

Let me make sure I did that right. First, 20% off 325 is 65, making it 260. Then 10% off 260 is 26, so 260-26=234. Yeah, that seems correct.

Looking at the options, option G is $234.00, so that must be the right answer.

The original price of the coat is $325.00. After a 20% discount in November, the price becomes:

\[
325 - (0.20 \times 325) = 325 - 65 = 260
\]

In December, an additional 10% discount is applied to the $260 price:

\[
260 - (0.10 \times 260) = 260 - 26 = 234
\]

Thus, the final price the Christmas shopper would pay is $234.00.

Answer: G
