Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the observed rotation of a solution using specific rotation and some other given data. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the question says that the specific rotation of L-alanine is +1.8 degrees. Wait, specific rotation is given as [α]^25_D, which I think means it's measured at 25 degrees Celsius using the D line of sodium (which is around 589 nm). So the temperature here is 25°C, which matches, so that's good.

The problem gives a 1.10 M solution. Molarity is moles per liter, right. And the polarimeter tube is 2.5 dm long. Wait, polarimeter tubes are measured in decimeters, and 1 dm is 10 cm. So 2.5 dm is 25 cm. Oh wait, no, wait: the tube length is given in decimeters, so 2.5 dm is 2.5 * 10 cm = 25 cm. So that's the path length, which is important.

I remember the formula for optical rotation is: observed rotation (in degrees) = specific rotation × concentration × path length. Oh wait, right, that's the equation. So the formula is α = [α] × c × l, where [α] is specific rotation, c is concentration, and l is the path length in dm.

Wait, units are important here. The concentration is given in mol/dm³, which is the same as M (since 1 M = 1 mol/dm³). And the path length is in dm, so that's 2.5 dm.

So putting in the numbers: [α] is 1.8 degrees, c is 1.10 M, and l is 2.5 dm.

So calculation would be: 1.8 * 1.10 * 2.5.

Let me compute that. 1.8 times 1.10 is... let's see, 1.8 * 1 = 1.8, 1.8 * 0.10 is 0.18. So 1.8 + 0.18 = 1.98. Then multiply by 2.5. 1.98 * 2.5.

Hmm, 2 * 2.5 is 5, 0.98 *2.5 is... let's think: 1 *2.5 is 2.5, minus 0.02*2.5 which is 0.05. So 2.5 - 0.05 = 2.45. So 5 (from 2 *2.5) plus 2.45 (from 0.98 * 2.5) equals 7.45? Wait wait, no, that can't be right because 1.98 * 2.5 is (2 - 0.02) *2.5. So 2*2.5 is 5, 0.02 *2.5 is 0.05. So 5 - 0.05 is 4.95.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, 1.98 * 2.5. Let's do it as (2 - 0.02) * 2.5. 2*2.5 is 5, 0.02*2.5 is 0.05. So 5 - 0.05 is 4.95. So the observed rotation is 4.95 degrees.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 4.95. Let me check the options again.

The options are A: 2.20°, B:1.76, C:5.28, D:3.96, E:0.44, F:4.40, G:0.22, H:1.10, I:0.88, J:2.64.

Hmm, 4.95 isn't among them. Oh wait, did I compute correctly? Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait 1.8 * 1.10 is 1.98. Then 1.98 * 2.5. Let me compute it another way. 1.98 *2 = 3.96, and 1.98 *0.5 is 0.99. So 3.96 + 0.99 is 4.95. Yeah, that's correct. So the observed rotation is 4.95 degrees.

Wait, but the options don't have 4.95. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. Oh wait, wait a minute. The specific rotation is given as [α]^25_D, which is correct for the conditions. So the formula is correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the units. Let me see: concentration is 1.10 M, which is 1.10 mol/dm³. The tube length is 2.5 dm. So yes, when you multiply (1.10) * (2.5 dm), you get dm·mol/dm³ which is just mol/L·dm, but since the specific rotation is in degrees per (mol/dm³ * dm), it works out to degrees. So the calculation was correct.

Hmm. So 4.95 isn't an option. Wait, looking at the options, option F is 4.40°, which is close but not exactly. Did I make a miscalculation?

Wait perhaps I should compute 1.8 * 1.10 * 2.5 again.

Let me compute 1.8 * 1.1 first. 1.8 * 1 is 1.8, 1.8 *0.1 is 0.18. So sum is 1.98. Then 1.98 *2.5.

Wait 1.98 is approximately 2, so 2 *2.5 is 5, but 0.02 less than 2, so 5 - (0.02 *2.5)=5-0.05=4.95.

So 4.95, but options don't have that. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 10 somewhere, like in the path length. Wait, wait the tube is 2.5 dm, which is 2.5 decimeters. Oh wait, no, polarimeter tubes are measured in decimeters, so 2.5 dm is correct. Wait, perhaps the specific rotation was given in a different unit? Or perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, the specific rotation formula is [α] = α / (c * l), so α = [α] * c * l.

Wait, perhaps the specific rotation given is in 10 cm, and I'm not accounting for that? No, specific rotation is per dm, because when using the formula, l is in dm. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, specific rotation is typically expressed in (degrees·dm)/(mol·dm³) or degrees/(mol·dm²), but when you multiply by concentration (mol/dm³) and path length (dm), you get degrees.

Wait, no, that's correct. So perhaps the specific rotation was given in a different unit. Or perhaps I'm missing a conversion factor.

Wait, wait. Oh wait, wait. Wait, specific rotation is sometimes given with a path length of 1 dm and concentration of 1 g/mL? No, wait, no, specific rotation is an intrinsic property, so the units are degrees per (g/100mL) per dm. Or wait, no, I might be mixing things up. Specific rotation is [α] = α / (c * l), where c is in g per 100 mL (i.e., g/100ml) and l is in dm. Wait, wait, maybe I got the units wrong. Oh wait, this is a crucial point.

Wait, specific rotation uses concentration in grams per mL, or per 100 mL? Oh right, I think in the specific rotation, the concentration is in grams per mL, but sometimes it's expressed as grams per 100 mL. Wait, no, the formula I know is [α] = (α observed) / (c * l), where c is in grams per mL, and l is in decimeters.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Specific rotation (also known as specific optical rotation) is defined as the optical rotation (in degrees) when the substance is placed in a 1 dm tube at a concentration of 1 g/mL. So [α] = α/(c * l), where c is in g/mL and l is in dm. Oh wait, but in the problem, the concentration is given in mol/L (M), not in g/mL. So that's a problem because M is mol/dm³ and g/mL is mass/volume.

Oh! Wait a minute, I see where I might have gone wrong. Oh no, I thought the formula uses molar concentration, but perhaps specific rotation uses mass concentration. So I need to convert the given molarity into grams per liter or grams per mL.

Wait, but in the problem, the given concentration is 1.10 M, which is 1.10 mol/dm³. But specific rotation uses grams per mL. So to compute the correct observed rotation, I need to convert the molarity to g/mL.

Wait, but wait, is specific rotation calculated using molarity or mass concentration? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me clarify.

Wait, specific rotation is an intensive property, it's defined as [α] = α/(c * l), where c is the concentration in grams per mL (g/mL), and l is the path length in dm. Wait, no, no, because 1 g/mL is 1000 g/dm³, which is 1000 kg/m³, which is a mass concentration. So perhaps I was wrong earlier in using molarity. Hmm, this could change everything.

Wait, but in the problem, the concentration is given in M (mol/dm³), but specific rotation uses mass concentration. So I can't just plug in 1.10 M directly. I need to find the mass concentration.

Wait, but wait, L-alanine is an amino acid. Let me calculate its molar mass to convert M to g/mL.

L-alanine's formula is C3H7NO2. Let's compute its molar mass. Carbon is 12 g/mol ×3 = 36. Hydrogen is 1 ×7 =7. Nitrogen is 14 ×1 =14. Oxygen is 16 ×2=32. So total is 36+7+14+32 = 89 g/mol.

So molar mass is approximately 89 g/mol.

So a solution of 1.10 M is 1.10 moles per liter, which is 1.10 mol/dm³. To convert this to g/dm³, multiply by molar mass: 1.10 mol/dm³ × 89 g/mol = 97.9 g/dm³. Since 1 dm³ is 1000 mL, 97.9 g/dm³ is 97.9 g per 1000 mL, which is 0.0979 g/mL.

Wait, but specific rotation uses c in g per 100 mL, so 0.0979 g/mL is 9.79 g per 100 mL. Wait, no: 1 mL is 0.001 dm³, and 1 g/mL is 1000 g/dm³. So 0.0979 g/mL is 97.9 g/dm³, which is the same as 97.9 g per liter. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused again.

Wait, to find c in g/100mL, which is 1 mL = 0.1 dm³. Wait, no, 100 mL is 0.1 dm³. So 97.9 g/dm³ is 97.9 g per 1000 mL, which is 9.79 g per 100 mL. So that's 9.79 g per 100 mL.

So now, using the specific rotation formula: [α] = α/(c * l), but in this case we're solving for α, so α = [α] * c * l.

Wait, but wait, the specific rotation given is +1.8 degrees, which I think is already in terms of g/100 mL and dm. So, if that's the case, then using c in g/100 mL and l in dm is correct.

So in this case, [α] is 1.8°, c is 9.79 g/100 mL, l is 2.5 dm.

Wait, but wait, no. Because the specific rotation is given as [α]^25_D, which is 1.8°, and that's defined as the rotation when the solution is at concentration of 1 g/mL (which is 100 g/dm³) in a 1 dm tube.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me get this straight: [α] is the rotation (in degrees) per (g/mL × dm). Or, more accurately, [α] = (degrees) / ( (g/mL) × dm ). So when you have a concentration c in g/mL and a path length l in dm, the observed rotation α is [α] × c × l.

Wait, but that would mean that [α] has units of degrees/(g/mL × dm). Or degrees per (g/mL·dm).

Wait, but in the problem, the concentration is 1.10 M, which we've converted to 0.0979 g/mL. So c is 0.0979 g/mL.

Then, the observed rotation would be [α] × c × l.

So let's plug in the numbers: [α] = 1.8°, c = 0.0979 g/mL, l = 2.5 dm.

Wait, but wait: [α] is 1.8°, which is defined as the rotation when c is 1 g/mL and l is 1 dm. So the calculation would be α = [α] × c × l.

So, substituting the values: 1.8 × 0.0979 × 2.5.

Let me compute that.

First, 0.0979 times 2.5 equals approximately 0.24475.

Then, 1.8 × 0.24475 ≈ 0.44035 degrees.

Wait, looking at the options, that's around 0.44°, which is option E. But previously, when I used molarity, I thought the answer was 4.95°, which isn't present. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the mass concentration instead of molarity.

Wait, but why is the formula using mass concentration and not molarity? Because specific rotation is defined based on mass, not moles. So the confusion arises because different sources might define it differently. So in this problem, perhaps the correct approach is to use mass concentration, not molarity.

Wait, but the problem gave the concentration in molarity. So perhaps the question expects us to use molarity, but I'm getting conflicting results. Alternatively, maybe I was wrong earlier, and specific rotation uses molarity.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to look up the formula again in my mind. Oh wait, I remember that specific rotation is defined as the rotation caused by a solution containing 1 g of the substance per mL (i.e., 1000 g/L) in a 1 dm path length. So the formula is [α] = α/(c × l), where c is in g/mL and l is in dm.

So, in this problem, the concentration is given in mol/L, which is different. So I need to convert that to g/mL.

Wait, the given concentration is 1.10 M, which is 1.10 mol/L. Since 1 L is 1000 mL, that's 1.10 mol per 1000 mL, or 0.00110 mol/mL.

Wait, but to get grams per mL, I need to multiply by molar mass. Molar mass of L-alanine is 89 g/mol. So 1.10 mol/L is 1.10 * 89 g/L = 97.9 g/L. Since 1 L is 1000 mL, that's 97.9 g per 1000 mL, which is 0.0979 g/mL.

So, the mass concentration c is 0.0979 g/mL. Then, using the formula α = [α] × c × l.

So [α] is 1.8°, c is 0.0979 g/mL, l is 2.5 dm.

So α = 1.8 × 0.0979 × 2.5. Let me compute that.

1.8 × 0.0979 is approximately 0.17622. Then, 0.17622 × 2.5 = approximately 0.44055 degrees. So around 0.44°, which is option E.

But earlier, when I used molarity, I got 4.95, which isn't an option. But since E is 0.44°, which is one of the options, maybe this is the correct approach.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I've seen the formula used with molarity before. Maybe in some contexts, specific rotation is expressed in terms of molarity, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to use the formula with molarity, leading to an answer of 4.95, which isn't an option. In that case, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should think again. Let me double-check the formula for specific rotation. Oh, specific rotation is indeed defined as α = [α] × c × l, where c is in g/mL and l is in dm. So using molarity would require converting to g/mL, as I did. So the correct approach is to get 0.44°, which is option E.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident because some sources might use different units. For example, specific rotation can sometimes be expressed in terms of molarity, but I think that's not the standard definition.

Wait, another perspective: perhaps the specific rotation is given as [α] in degrees per (M × dm). So using M as molarity and dm as path length. In that case, the formula would be α = [α] × M × l.

Then, substituting the given values: [α] =1.8°, M=1.10, l=2.5 dm. So 1.8 ×1.10 ×2.5 = 4.95°, which isn't an option. So that can't be right, because none of the options have that.

Hmm, that's confusing. But if I stick to the standard definition where specific rotation uses mass concentration, then the correct answer would be E: 0.44°.

Wait, but wait, the problem
