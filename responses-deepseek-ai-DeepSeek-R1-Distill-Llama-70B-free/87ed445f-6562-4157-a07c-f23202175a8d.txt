Okay, so I've got this question about the differences between animal and plant cells. Let me think this through step by step. 

The question is asking what animal cells have that plant cells don't. The options are A to D. I remember that plant and animal cells share some structures, but there are some key differences.

First, I recall that plant cells have a cell wall made of cellulose. So option A says animal cells have that. Wait, no, I think that's only plant cells. So A is incorrect because animal cells don't have a cell wall like that.

Option B is lysosomes. Hmm, I think both animal and plant cells have lysosomes. Or wait, do plant cells have them? I'm a bit fuzzy here. Plant cells might have fewer, but lysosomes are more prominent in animal cells because they're involved in breaking down waste, which is a bigger deal in animals. So maybe B is a correct point, but I'm not entirely sure yet.

Option C is large vacuoles storing water. Oh right, plant cells typically have one large central vacuole that helps with structure and storage. Animal cells usually have smaller vacuoles, maybe not as large. So C is something plant cells have, so it's not the right answer for this question.

Option D is centrioles within centrosomes. I remember that centrioles are involved in forming cilia and the spindle during cell division. Plant cells don't have centrioles, or at least not in the same way. So animal cells have centrioles, especially around the centrosome area, which helps in organizing microtubules. So D seems like a correct difference.

Wait, but what about lysosomes again? Let me think. Plant cells do have lysosomes, but perhaps not as many. Because plant cells have vacuoles that handle some of the digestive processes. So maybe lysosomes are more a feature of animal cells. But I'm not certain if that's a standard difference they test on.

So the question is which option is correct. The question asks what animal cells have that plant cells don't. So looking at the options, D stands out because plant cells lack centrioles. And B might be correct, but I'm not as sure about that. Let me make sure.

Another point: plant cells have chloroplasts, which is a big difference, but that's not one of the options here. So from the given choices, I think D is the correct answer because centrioles are found in animal cells and not typically in plant cells. Centrioles are involved in the formation of cilia and flagella, which are more common in animal cells, and during mitosis, the centrosome (with centrioles) organizes the spindle fibers. Plant cells, on the other hand, organize their spindle fibers without centrioles, using other structures.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be D: centrioles within centrosomes.

Animal cells differ from plant cells in several key ways. Plant cells have a cell wall made of cellulose, which is not found in animal cells, so option A is incorrect. While both plant and animal cells have vacuoles, plant cells typically have a single large vacuole for storage and structural support, whereas animal cells have smaller vacuoles, making option C incorrect. Lysosomes are present in both plant and animal cells, though they are more prominent in animal cells, so option B is not a definitive distinction. The most accurate difference is that animal cells have centrioles within centrosomes, which are involved in processes like cell division and cilia formation, whereas plant cells lack centrioles. Therefore, the correct answer is:

D: centrioles within centrosomes

Answer: D
