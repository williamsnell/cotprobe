Question:

A crude model for the molecular distribution of atmospheric gases above Earth's surface (denoted by height $h$ ) can be obtained by considering the potential energy due to gravity:
$$
P(h)=e^{-m g h / k T}
$$
In this expression $m$ is the per-particle mass of the gas, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $k$ is a constant equal to $1.38 \times 10^{-23} \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}$, and $T$ is temperature. Determine $\langle h\rangle$ for methane $\left(\mathrm{CH}_4\right)$ using this distribution function.

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the molecular distribution of atmospheric gases. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question gives me a formula for the pressure at height h, P(h) = e^(-mgh/(kT)). I remember this is related to the barometric formula, which describes how atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude. So they're asking for the average height ⟨h⟩ for methane (CH4) using this distribution.

Wait, but wait. I think the average value in such a distribution is found by integrating h times the distribution function over all possible h, divided by the normalization factor. So ⟨h⟩ would be the integral from 0 to infinity of h * P(h) dh, divided by the integral of P(h) dh from 0 to infinity.

Wait, but P(h) is given as the probability distribution? Or is it the probability density function? Oh, right, I think in this model, P(h) is proportional to the probability density. So to find the expectation value ⟨h⟩, I need to compute the integral of h * P(h) dh from 0 to ∞, divided by the integral of P(h) dh from 0 to ∞.

Wait, let me make sure. Because the way it's given, P(h) is the probability per unit height, and it's normalized. Or is it? Because sometimes in such models, the distribution is given as a density, so you need to normalize it.

Wait, but e^(-mgh/(kT)) when integrated from 0 to ∞. Let me compute the normalization first. The integral of e^(-a h) dh from 0 to ∞ is 1/a, where a is positive. So the integral of P(h) would be 1/(m g/(k T)) )? Wait, wait, let's see.

Wait, P(h) = e^{- m g h / (k T)}. So the integral over h from 0 to ∞ is ∫ e^{- (m g/(k T)) h } dh = [ -k T/(m g) e^{- (m g/(k T)) h } ] from 0 to ∞. At ∞, the exponential is zero, and at 0, it's 1. So the integral is k T/(m g). So the normalization factor is 1/(k T/(m g)) ) = m g/(k T).

Wait, but for the expectation value, ⟨h⟩ would be ∫ h P(h) dh from 0 to ∞ divided by the normalization factor. Or wait, no. Let me think again.

Actually, the probability distribution is P(h) = (m g/(k T)) e^{- m g h / (k T)} }, because when you integrate this from 0 to ∞, you get 1. So the normalized probability distribution is P(h) = (m g/(k T)) e^{- m g h/(k T)}.

Oh wait, no. Wait, the given P(h) is e^{- m g h/(k T)}, which is the same as e^{- h / H}, where H is the scale height H = k T/(m g). The integral of this from 0 to ∞ would be H, so to make it a probability distribution, we need to multiply by 1/H. So the normalized P(h) is (1/H) e^{-h/H}.

So the expectation value ⟨h⟩ is ∫ h P(h) dh from 0 to ∞, which in this case is H times the integral of x e^{-x} dx from 0 to ∞, with x = h/H. The integral of x e^{-x} dx from 0 to ∞ is 1! So ⟨h⟩ is H * 1 = H.

Wait, so ⟨h⟩ is equal to H, the scale height. Because the distribution is exponential, the average is the scale height.

So H is k T/(m g). That makes sense. So I just need to compute H for methane, CH4.

Now, methane's molar mass is needed. Methane is CH4: carbon is about 12 g/mol, and each hydrogen is about 1 g/mol. So 12 + 4*1 =16 g/mol. Wait, that's 16 grams per mole. To get per molecule, I need to find the mass per molecule.

Avogadro's number is approximately 6.022e23 molecules/mol. So m = (16 g/mol) / (6.022e23 molecules/mol) ) * converting grams to kg.

Wait, 16 grams is 0.016 kg. So m = 0.016 kg/mol / (6.022e23 molecules/mol) ) = 0.016 / 6.022e23 kg/molecule.

Let me compute that: 0.016 / 6.022e23 = approximately 2.656e-26 kg per molecule.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation.

16 g is 0.016 kg. So 0.016 kg divided by 6.022e23 molecules is (0.016) / (6.022e23) = (1.6e-2) / (6.022e23) ) = (1.6 /6.022 )e-25 = approximately 0.2655e-25 = 2.655e-26 kg per molecule. So m ≈ 2.655e-26 kg.

Now, k is given as 1.38e-23 J/K. T is temperature; assuming it's in Kelvin, but the problem doesn't specify. Wait, the problem doesn't give a temperature value. Hmm, wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, the question must assume a standard temperature, maybe like 250 K or 300 K? Because without T, we can't compute H.

Wait, but the problem statement doesn't specify a temperature. Wait, perhaps I missed that. Let me check the question again.

The question gives P(h) = e^{-m g h/(k T)}, and the rest of the parameters. So to compute H, I need T. Since it's not given, maybe the question expects me to use standard temperature, say 250 K? Or perhaps 273 K or 300 K.

Wait, perhaps the question expects room temperature, 20°C, which is 293 K. But without it, I can't compute. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should check the options. The options are on the order of 1e4 meters, which is about 10 km. So let's compute H for CH4.

Wait, let me proceed. Let's say T is 250 K. Let me proceed with that assumption for now.

So H = (k T) / (m g).

k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

T = 250 K.

m = 2.655e-26 kg.

g is 9.81 m/s².

Plugging the numbers in:

H = (1.38e-23 * 250) / (2.655e-26 * 9.81 )

Compute numerator: 1.38e-23 * 250 = 345e-23 = 3.45e-21.

Denominator: 2.655e-26 *9.81 ≈ 2.655e-26 * 1e1 = 2.655e-25, but more accurately, 2.655e-26 *9.81 = let's compute 2.655 *9.81 ≈ 26.07. So 26.07e-26 = 2.607e-25.

So H = 3.45e-21 / 2.607e-25 = (3.45 / 2.607) * 1e4 = approx 1.322 * 1e4 = 1.322e4 meters, so about 13,220 meters, or 1.3e4 m.

Looking at the options, option E is 1.4e4 m, which is close. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the temperature assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the temperature is 300 K. Let me recalculate with T=300 K.

H = (1.38e-23 * 300) / (2.655e-26 *9.81 )

Numerator: 1.38e-23 *300 = 4.14e-21.

Denominator: same as before, 2.607e-25.

H = 4.14e-21 / 2.607e-25 = (4.14 / 2.607 ) * 1e4.

4.14 / 2.607 ≈ 1.586. So H≈1.586e4 m. So about 15,860 m, which is approximately 1.6e4 m.

Looking at the options, option F is 1.6e4 m. Hmm, but earlier with T=250 K, I got 1.3e4 m.

Wait, but what's the standard temperature usually taken? Maybe 250 K is more relevant for the atmosphere, but sometimes they use 300 K as room temperature.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate more accurately. Let me compute with T=250 K.

H = (1.38e-23 * 250) / (2.655e-26 *9.81 )

Compute numerator: 1.38e-23 *250 = 345e-23 = 3.45e-21 J.

Denominator: 2.655e-26 kg *9.81 m/s² = (2.655 *9.81) e-26 kg·m/s² = 26.07e-26 kg·m/s² = 2.607e-25 N.

So H = (3.45e-21) / (2.607e-25) ) = (3.45 / 2.607 ) * 1e4.

3.45 / 2.607 ≈ 1.322. So H≈1.322e4 m.

Looking at the options, the closest is option E:1.4e4 m, which is 14,000 m.

Wait, but let me check my calculation again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating m, the mass per molecule.

The molar mass of CH4 is 16 g/mol, which is 0.016 kg/mol. So per molecule, m = 0.016 kg/mol / Avogadro's number.

Avogadro's number is 6.022e23 /mol.

So m = 0.016 / 6.022e23 = 0.016 / 6.022e23 = 2.655e-26 kg.

Yes, that seems correct.

Wait, but maybe I should use a different temperature. Let's see what happens if T is 273 K, like 0°C.

H=(1.38e-23 *273)/(2.655e-26 *9.81)

1.38e-23 *273 = 376.14e-23 = 3.7614e-21.

Denominator same:2.607e-25.

So H=3.7614e-21 /2.607e-25 ≈ (3.7614 /2.607 )e4 ≈ 1.442e4 m, which is approximately 14,420 m. So about 1.44e4 m. Option E is 1.4e4, which is 14,000 m. So that's pretty close.

But wait, perhaps the question assumes T is 250 K, which gives us 1.32e4, which is 13,200 m. None of the options match exactly, but perhaps the calculation expects an approximate value.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Let me calculate each step precisely.

First, compute m for methane:

Molar mass M = 16 g/mol = 0.016 kg/mol.

m = M / N_A = 0.016 / (6.022e23) kg.

0.016 /6.022e23 = let me compute that.

0.016 /6.022e23 = (1.6e-2) / (6.022e23) = (1.6 /6.022 )e-25 = approx 0.2655e-25 = 2.655e-26 kg.

Yes, correct.

Now compute H = (k T) / (m g).

k=1.38e-23 J/K.

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: k T = 1.38e-23 * T.

Denominator: m g = 2.655e-26 *9.81.

Compute denominator first: 2.655e-26 *9.81 = ?

2.655 *9.81 = let's compute that.

2.655 * 9 =23.895; 2.655 *0.81=2.15055. So total is 23.895+2.15055=25.04555.

So denominator is 25.04555e-26 = 2.504555e-25.

So H = (1.38e-23 * T ) / (2.504555e-25 )

So H = (1.38 / 2.504555 ) * (1e-23 / 1e-25 ) * T.

1e-23 /1e-25 = 1e2=100.

So 1.38 /2.504555 ≈ 0.5507.

So H ≈0.5507 *100 * T =55.07 * T.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, the units. Let me recompute.

Wait, H = (k T) / (m g )

Units:

k is J/(K) = (kg m²/s²)/K.

m is kg.

g is m/s².

So m g is kg * m/s² = (kg m/s²) = N.

So k T is J = N m. So numerator is N m, denominator is N. So H is m, which is correct.

So the formula is correct.

So H=(1.38e-23 * T ) / (2.655e-26 *9.81 )

= (1.38e-23 * T ) / (2.607e-25 )

= (1.38 / 2.607 ) * (1e-23 / 1e-25 ) * T

= (0.529) * 100 * T

Wait, 1.38 /2.607 is approximately 0.529.

So 0.529 *100 =52.9.

So H =52.9 * T meters.

Wait, but that's in meters. So H=52.9 T.

Wait, that can't be right because, for example, when T=300 K, H would be 15,870 m, which matches my earlier calculation.

Wait, so H =52.9 * T meters.

So if T is 250 K, H=52.9 *250=13,225 m.

If T is 273 K, H=52.9 *273≈14,442 m.

If T is 300 K, H=15,870 m.

So the question is, what value of T to use? The problem statement doesn't specify, but perhaps it's assuming T=250 K, which is about 0°C. Or maybe it's 300 K, room temperature.

Looking at the options, option E is 1.4e4 m (14,000 m), which would correspond to T= approximately 264 K. Let me check:

If H=14,000 m, then T= H /52.9 ≈14000 /52.9≈264.7 K.

Alternatively, if the question uses T=300 K, then H≈15,870 m, but that's not one of the options either. Wait, the options have 1.6e4 m (F) and 1.4e4 (E), 1.6 is 16,000, which would correspond to T=16,000 /52.9≈302.5 K. So perhaps the intended T is 300 K, and the answer is F)1.6e4 m.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the problem uses the molar mass in kg/kmol instead of per molecule? No, because we calculated per molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of m.

Wait, methane has a molar mass of 16.04 g/mol, maybe I should be more precise. Let me compute exact m.

M = 16.04 g/mol = 0.01604 kg/mol.

m = 0.01604 / 6.022e23 = let's compute.

0.01604 /6.022e23 = 1.604e-2 /6.022e23 = (1.604 /6.022 )e-25.

1.604 /6.022 ≈0.2663. So m≈0.2663e-25 kg = 2.663e-26 kg.

So m =2.663e-26 kg.

So denominator m g =2.663e-26 *9.81≈2.663 *9.81 = approx 26.13e-26 = 2.613e-25.

H= (1.38e-23 * T ) / (2.613e-25 ) = (1.38 /2.613 ) * (1e-23 /1e-25 ) * T = (0.528 ) *100 * T=52.8 T.

So H≈52.8 T meters.

So, for T=250 K, H=52.8*250=13194 m.

Which is about 1.32e4 m, closest to option E:1.4e4.

Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes T is 280 K.

H=52.8 *280=14,784 m, which is ~1.478e4, so 1.48e4, which would be closer to option E:1.4e4 or option F:1.6e4. Hmm.

Wait, but without knowing T, I can't proceed. So perhaps the question expects me to use room temperature, which is 293 K.

So H=52.8 *293 ≈ 52.8 *290=15,252 plus 52.8*3=158.4 → total≈15,410 m. That's ~1.54e4 m, which is closer to option E (1.4e4) or F (1.6e4).

Wait, but perhaps the problem uses a different approach. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the average height is the same as the scale height. Because for an exponential distribution, the mean is the scale height. So ⟨h⟩= H.

So, in that case, I just need to compute H = k T/(m g).
