Okay, so I have this question about what defines being overweight. Hmm, I remember that BMI, which stands for Body Mass Index, is a common measure used. BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters. The categories based on BMI are underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese.

Wait, I think the categories are something like this: underweight is BMI less than 18.5. Normal weight is from 18.5 to 24.9. Then overweight starts at 25, right? And obesity is 30 and above. Or was it 25 to 29.9 for overweight and 30+ for obesity? I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact numbers. 

Looking at the options, let me go through each one. Option C says BMI 25-30 kg/m². Option F is 26-30, which might be too narrow. Option G is 25-29.9, which sounds familiar because I think the cutoff for obesity is 30. So maybe G is correct. 

Wait, let me think again. The standard categories are: 

- Underweight: BMI <18.5
- Normal weight: 18.5 to 24.9
- Overweight: 25 to 29.9
- Obese: BMI ≥30

So according to that, being overweight is a BMI of 25 up to, but not including, 30. So the correct range is 25-29.9 kg/m². Looking back at the options, that's option G.

Wait, but another option is H: BMI >25. That would include 25 and above, but that would also include people who are obese since 30 is included. So H can't be right because it doesn't stop at 30. So G is the accurate one because it stops at 29.9, which is just below the obesity threshold.

So the answer should be option G.

The correct definition of overweight is a BMI ranging from 25 to 29.9 kg/m². This range is based on standard BMI categories, where:

- Underweight: BMI < 18.5
- Normal weight: 18.5 to 24.9
- Overweight: 25 to 29.9
- Obese: BMI ≥ 30

Option G (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m²) accurately reflects the overweight category, as it stops at 29.9, distinguishing it from obesity, which begins at 30.

Answer: G
