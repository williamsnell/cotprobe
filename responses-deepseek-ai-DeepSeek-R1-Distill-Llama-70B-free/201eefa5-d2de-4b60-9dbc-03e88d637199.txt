Okay, I need to figure out the major risk group for HIV infection among Latinos. The question gives me options from A to J, and I have to choose the correct one. Let me think about each option and what I know about HIV risk factors, especially in Latino communities.

First, I remember that HIV transmission can occur through various routes, including sexual contact, sharing needles, mother-to-child during pregnancy, and others. The question is about the major risk group, so I'm looking for the group with the highest rates or most significant risk factors.

Option A: Healthcare workers. They can be at risk due to occupational exposure, like needlestick injuries, but I don't think this is the major group. It's more of an occupational hazard and probably not the highest risk in the general Latino population.

Option B: Pregnant women. They can be at risk if they contract HIV, but they themselves aren't necessarily a major risk group. They might be more of a vulnerable population for prevention rather than a high-risk group.

Option C: Injection drug users. I recall that sharing needles is a significant risk factor for HIV. In many communities, including Latino populations, injection drug use is a major driver of HIV transmission. This could be a strong candidate.

Option D: Heterosexual males. While heterosexual transmission is a route, I think in some communities, men who have sex with men (MSM) are at higher risk. So maybe D isn't the top group.

Option E: Elderly individuals. I don't think age alone is a major risk factor here. The elderly might be less likely to engage in high-risk behaviors, though they can still be affected.

Option F: Individuals with no sexual activity. Well, if they're not sexually active, their risk is lower unless other factors are involved, like needle sharing. So this group is probably not at high risk.

Option G: Vegetarians. Diet choice doesn't relate to HIV risk, so this is irrelevant.

Option H: Females. Being female can be a risk due to biological and societal factors, but it's too broad. The question is about the major risk group, which is more specific.

Option I: Children under 12. They can get HIV through mother-to-child transmission, but again, not the major risk group in terms of new infections.

Option J: Homosexual males. MSM, including Latino MSM, are at a higher risk globally. In many regions, MSM is one of the highest risk groups for HIV. But I'm not sure if this is the case specifically for Latinos.

Wait, I remember that in some Latino cultures, MSM might face stigma, leading to higher-risk behaviors. Also, injection drug use is a significant issue in certain Latino communities, particularly in areas with high rates of substance abuse.

So I'm torn between C (Injection drug users) and J (Homosexual males). Which one is the major risk group? I think in the Latino population, both are significant, but perhaps one is more prominent.

I think that in the United States, for example, Latino MSM are disproportionately affected by HIV. However, injection drug use is also a major factor, especially in regions with high rates of drug abuse.

Wait, the question is about the major risk group. I'm trying to recall recent data. I believe that among Latinos, the highest risk is actually among men who have sex with men. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, injection drug use could be the primary mode in certain regions.

Another angle: globally, the major modes of transmission vary. In some areas, it's mostly sexual transmission, while in others, it's via injection drug use. For Latinos, especially in the US, I think MSM is a significant group. But I'm not certain if that's the major risk group compared to injection drug users.

Alternatively, considering that the question is about the "major risk group," perhaps it refers to the transmission category. For instance, in CDC data, among Hispanic/Latino populations, the highest proportion of new HIV diagnoses is among gay and bisexual men. So that would point to option J.

Wait, but the options don't specify "gay and bisexual men," but rather "homosexual males." So J would be the correct answer if that's the case.

But I'm a bit confused because I also know that injection drug use is a major issue in some Latino communities. So maybe C is correct in certain contexts.

Wait, the question is about the "major risk group." So which group has the highest incidence or prevalence? I think that among Latinos in the US, MSM account for the majority of new HIV cases. So J would be the answer.

Alternatively, if considering that injection drug use is a significant mode of transmission, perhaps C is correct. I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, another approach: think about the options. The question is about the major risk group, not the mode of transmission. So it's about which group is at highest risk.

In the Latino community, both MSM and injection drug users are at high risk. But which is the major one? I think MSM is the larger group affected. For example, in 2019, CDC reported that among Latino men, the majority of new HIV infections were among those who have sex with men. So J would be the correct answer.

Wait, but the options don't have "men who have sex with men," but rather "homosexual males." I think that's the same category.

So I'm leaning towards J: Homosexual males as the major risk group.

But wait, another thought: in some regions, like Puerto Rico, injection drug use is a huge problem and contributes significantly to HIV rates among Latinos. So maybe C is correct.

I'm a bit confused now. I need to make a decision.

Considering that in the US, the major risk group for Latinos is MSM, I think J is the answer. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, if the question is about transmission categories, injection drug use is a major route, but the risk group would be the people in that category, which is C.

Wait, the question is about the major risk group, so it's about the population, not the method. So if injection drug users are a significant population with high rates, then C would be correct.

I think in some regions, like New York City, among Latinos, injection drug use is a leading cause of HIV. So perhaps C is the answer.

But I'm not certain. I think I need to go with what I know. From what I've studied before, in the Latino community, both MSM and IDUs are high-risk groups, but I think MSM is a larger group in terms of new infections.

Wait, let me think again. The CDC's data: In 2019, among Hispanic/Latino gay and bisexual men, they accounted for about 23% of new HIV diagnoses among all gay and bisexual men in the US. So they are a significant proportion.

But the question is about the major risk group among Latinos. So among Latinos, who is at highest risk? It's probably the men who have sex with men.

So the answer would be J: Homosexual males.

Wait, but the option is "homosexual males," which is a specific term. But in reality, it's men who have sex with men, which includes those who don't identify as homosexual. So perhaps the terminology is a bit off, but the closest option is J.

So I think the correct answer is J.

The major risk group for HIV infection among Latinos can be determined by analyzing the transmission categories and demographic data. While injection drug users (IDUs) are a significant risk group due to the sharing of needles, the question focuses on the "major risk group," which refers to the population with the highest rates or prevalence of HIV infection.

Among Latinos, men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately affected by HIV. According to CDC data, in the United States, Latino MSM account for a substantial proportion of new HIV diagnoses. This makes homosexual males the major risk group in this context. While injection drug use is also a significant issue in some Latino communities, the data suggest that MSM represent the largest affected group.

Given the options, "homosexual males" (option J) is the closest term to describe this group, even though the terminology could be more precise by specifying "men who have sex with men." Therefore, the correct answer is:

J: Homosexual males.
