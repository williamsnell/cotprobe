Question:

The perfectly competitive videotape-copying industry is composed of many firms that can copy five tapes per day at an average cost of $10 per tape. Each firm must also pay a royalty to film studios, and the per-film royalty rate (r) is an increasing function of total industry output (Q): r = 0.002Q. Demand is given by Q = D(P) = 1,050 - 50P. Assuming the industry is in long-run equilibrium, what will be the equilibrium price of copied tapes?

Okay, so I've got this economics problem here about the videotape-copying industry. It's a perfectly competitive market, which I remember means that there are a lot of firms, they produce a homogeneous product, and no single firm can influence the market price. So in the long run, firms enter or exit until economic profits are zero.

The problem states that each firm can copy five tapes per day at an average cost of $10 per tape. Wait, so each firm produces 5 tapes a day, each costing $10. So each firm's daily cost is 5 tapes * $10 = $50. But wait, maybe that's not the way to look at it. Oh, wait, no, average cost per tape is $10. So each tape costs them $10 to produce. So if a firm produces, say, Q tapes, their total cost is 10*Q. But since each firm can copy five per day, maybe that's their capacity, but in the long run, they can presumably adjust their number of plants or something, so maybe the average cost is $10 per tape regardless of how many they produce. Hmm, but I think for this problem, each firm's cost is such that they can produce at an average cost of $10 per tape. But I might be overcomplicating it.

Each firm must also pay a royalty to film studios, and the royalty rate r is an increasing function of total industry output Q, given by r = 0.002Q. So the royalty per tape is 0.002 times Q. So if the total industry output is, say, 1000 tapes, then r would be 0.002 * 1000 = $2 per tape. So each tape sold by a firm adds a royalty cost of r per tape, which depends on the entire industry's output.

The demand is given by Q = D(P) = 1050 - 50P. So the total quantity demanded is 1050 minus 50 times the price. 

The question is asking for the equilibrium price when the industry is in long-run equilibrium. In a perfectly competitive market, long-run equilibrium is where price equals average cost (including all costs, I think). But wait, in this case, there's also a royalty, which is a cost that depends on the industry's output. So each firm's total cost per tape is average cost plus the royalty rate per tape. But the royalty rate depends on the industry's total output, which is Q. So this is a bit tricky because the royalty per tape isn't fixed but depends on how much the whole industry produces.

Let me think through this step by step.

First, in long-run equilibrium, each firm is producing where P = ATC, and since it's a perfectly competitive market, firms are making zero economic profits. So the price that firms receive must equal their average total cost, including any per-unit costs like the royalty.

Each firm's cost structure is: average cost of production is $10 per tape, and then there's a royalty per tape of r = 0.002Q. So the total cost per tape for each firm would be 10 + r, because each tape they produce adds that royalty. Therefore, the total cost per tape is 10 + 0.002Q.

But wait, wait. Since each firm takes the royalty rate as given, but the royalty rate depends on the total industry output, which is Q. So each firm's cost per unit is 10 + 0.002Q. But Q is the total quantity produced by the entire industry.

In equilibrium, the price P should equal the marginal cost (MC), but wait, no. Wait, in long-run equilibrium for perfect competition, P equals ATC, but also, at the equilibrium, the MC should be equal to P because firms will choose the quantity where MC = P. Wait, maybe I'm confusing short-run and long-run. In the short run, P = MC, but in the long run, P = ATC because firms enter or exit until profits are zero.

Hmm, perhaps I should model this more carefully.

The firms in the industry face a demand curve Q = 1050 - 50P. So the inverse demand is P = (1050 - Q)/50 = 21 - 0.02Q.

Each firm's marginal cost is the derivative of their total cost. Their total cost is (10 + r) * q, where q is the quantity produced by the firm, and r is 0.002Q, with Q being the total industry output. But wait, if each firm is producing q, then Q is the sum of all firms' q. But since all firms are identical, and there are N firms, Q = N * q.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the industry. Let me try to model the industry's cost.

Wait, each firm's cost per tape is 10 plus the royalty rate r. So each firm's average cost is 10 + 0.002Q. But Q is the total industry output.

In a perfectly competitive market, firms take the price as given. So each firm's supply decision is to produce where P equals marginal cost. But in this case, each firm's marginal cost is the derivative of their total cost with respect to their own output. Wait, but their cost per unit is 10 + 0.002Q, and Q is the total output of all firms, so each firm's marginal cost depends on the total output.

Wait, but for each individual firm, when they produce an additional unit, Q increases by 1, which affects r by 0.002. So the royalty per unit increases by 0.002 for each unit the industry produces. So each firm's marginal cost is 10 + 0.002Q, but when a firm produces an additional unit, Q increases by 1, so the marginal cost for that unit is 10 + 0.002(Q + 1). Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the right way to model it. Alternatively, perhaps the marginal cost for each firm is 10 + 0.002Q, treating Q as given, but in reality, each firm's production contributes to Q.

Wait, perhaps I should think of this as a cost that depends on the total output. So each firm's cost is (10 + 0.002Q) * q, where q is the firm's output. So the marginal cost for the firm is 10 + 0.002Q + 0.002 * dq/dq? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the marginal cost is 10 + 0.002Q, because adding another unit increases Q by 1, which increases the royalty per unit by 0.002, so the total cost increases by (10 + 0.002(Q +1)) for that extra unit. Wait, that's getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should approach this differently.

Let me think about the industry's total cost. The industry's total cost would be (10 + 0.002Q) * Q, because each tape has a cost of 10 plus 0.002Q, and there are Q tapes. So the industry's total cost is (10 + 0.002Q) * Q. Then, the industry's marginal cost would be the derivative of this with respect to Q. Let's compute that.

TC = (10 + 0.002Q) * Q = 10Q + 0.002Q^2
So d(TC)/dQ = 10 + 0.004Q
That's the industry's marginal cost.

In a perfectly competitive market, the industry's supply curve is where P equals marginal cost. So in equilibrium, P = MC = 10 + 0.004Q.

But at the same time, the demand is P = 21 - 0.02Q.

So setting them equal: 10 + 0.004Q = 21 - 0.02Q.

Let me solve for Q.

Bring all terms to one side:

0.004Q + 0.02Q = 21 -10
0.024Q = 11
Q = 11 / 0.024
Let me compute that.

11 divided by 0.024. Let's see:

0.024 * 458 = approx 11, because 0.024 * 400 = 9.6, 0.024 * 58 = approx 1.392, so 9.6 +1.392= 10.992, which is close to 11. So Q ≈ 458.333. Let me do it more accurately.

Compute 11 / 0.024:

11 / 0.024 = (11 * 1000) / 24 = 11000 /24 ≈ 458.3333.

So Q ≈ 458.333.

Now, substitute Q back into the demand equation to find P.

P = 21 - 0.02Q = 21 - 0.02*(458.333)
Compute 0.02 * 458.333 = 9.16666...

So P = 21 - 9.166666 ≈ 11.833333.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see $11.83. The options are in whole dollars. The closest would be $12, but let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the industry's marginal cost. Let's go back.

The royalty per tape is r = 0.002Q. So each tape's royalty is 0.002Q. So the total royalty paid by the industry is 0.002Q * Q = 0.002Q². The production cost for the industry is 10Q, since each tape costs $10 to produce. So total cost (TC) for the industry is 10Q + 0.002Q².

Then, the marginal cost (MC) is the derivative of TC with respect to Q, which is 10 + 0.004Q. That's correct.

So setting P = MC = 10 + 0.004Q.

The demand is P = 21 - 0.02Q.

So setting them equal:

10 + 0.004Q = 21 - 0.02Q

0.004Q + 0.02Q = 21 -10

0.024Q = 11

Q = 11 / 0.024 ≈ 458.333

So P = 21 - 0.02 * 458.333 = 21 - 9.16666... = 11.8333.

So about $11.83. Now, looking at the options:

Options are A:13, B:15, C:14, D:16, E:11, F:9, G:10, H:17, I:8, J:12.

Hmm, the closest is J:12, but wait, maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, could it be that I should have considered that each firm's cost includes the royalty, and perhaps the royalty is a fixed cost? No, the royalty is per tape, so it's a variable cost. So the approach I took seems correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should model it from the individual firm's perspective. Let me try that.

Each firm's total cost is: TC_firm = (10 + r) * q, where r = 0.002Q, and Q is total industry output, which is N*q, where N is the number of firms.

Wait, but in long-run equilibrium, each firm's P = ATC. Wait, no, that's only in the case where the firm's ATC is at its minimum, and the industry is in equilibrium.

Wait, perhaps another approach. In a perfectly competitive market, each firm's supply curve is its marginal cost. The industry's supply curve is the sum of all firms' marginal costs. But in this case, each firm's marginal cost depends on the total industry output, which complicates things.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as each firm facing a marginal cost of 10 + 0.002Q, but since Q is the total output, each firm's marginal cost depends on Q, which is the sum of all firms' outputs.

Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to realize that in equilibrium, the price P must equal the marginal cost, which includes the royalty. So P = 10 + 0.002Q + the change in royalty from producing an extra unit.

Wait, perhaps that's what I did before with the industry's MC being 10 + 0.004Q. Let me think again.

Wait, each tape produced adds 0.002 to the royalty rate. So for each additional tape produced by the industry, the royalty per tape increases by 0.002. So the marginal cost of producing that extra tape is 10 (production cost) plus the increase in royalty for all existing tapes. Wait, no, that's not right. Because if the industry produces one more tape, the royalty per tape increases by 0.002. So for each existing Q tapes, the royalty per tape increases by 0.002, so the total additional cost from the royalty increase is 0.002 * Q. Plus the 10 for producing the extra tape. So the marginal cost would be 10 + 0.002Q + 0.002 (because the extra tape adds 0.002 to the royalty rate, so for that extra tape, the royalty is 0.002*(Q+1). Hmm, maybe that's where the 0.004 comes from.

Wait, let me clarify. The royalty per tape is r = 0.002Q. So if the industry increases Q by 1 unit, then r increases by 0.002. So the additional cost from the royalty for that one extra unit is 0.002*(Q + 1). But wait, no, because each existing tape's royalty increases by 0.002 when Q increases by 1. So, for Q existing tapes, the royalty increases by 0.002 per tape, so total additional royalty cost is 0.002*Q. Plus the cost of producing the extra tape, which is 10 + 0.002*(Q +1). Wait, perhaps that's overcomplicating it.

Alternatively, the marginal cost of producing an additional tape is the production cost (10) plus the increase in royalty cost per tape times the number of tapes produced. So, when Q increases by 1, the royalty per tape increases by 0.002, so the total additional royalty cost is 0.002 * Q (because each of the Q tapes now has a higher royalty by 0.002). Therefore, the marginal cost is 10 + 0.002Q.

Wait, that's different from the earlier approach where I took the derivative of TC as 10 + 0.004Q. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, if TC = 10Q + 0.002Q², then d(TC)/dQ = 10 + 0.004Q, which would be the marginal cost. But another approach suggests the marginal cost is 10 + 0.002Q. Which is correct?

Wait, I think the derivative approach is correct because it accounts for the change in total cost as Q increases. Let me see: if you have TC = 10Q + 0.002Q², then the derivative is 10 + 0.004Q, which represents the marginal cost of producing an additional unit. So that's correct.

So when I set P = MC, I have P = 10 + 0.004Q.

And the demand is P = 21 - 0.02Q.

Setting equal: 10 + 0.004Q = 21 - 0.02Q
0.024Q = 11
Q ≈ 458.333

Then P ≈ 21 - 0.02*458.333 ≈ 11.8333.

So the equilibrium price is approximately $11.83. But the options don't have this exact value. The closest is J: $12. But let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are A:13, B:15, C:14, D:16, E:11, F:9, G:10, H:17, I:8, J:12.

So J is $12, which is very close to our calculation, but E is $11, which is a bit lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation earlier. Let me check again.

Wait, P = 21 - 0.02 * 458.333.

Compute 0.02 * 458.333: 458.333 * 0.02 = 9.16666...

So 21 - 9.16666 = 11.8333, which is about $11.83. So the closest option is J:12.

But wait, perhaps I should consider that in the long run, each firm's average cost, including the royalty, equals the price. So the average total cost per tape is 10 + 0.002Q.

In long-run equilibrium, P = ATC.

So P = 10 + 0.002Q.

But P is also equal to 21 - 0.02Q from demand.

So setting them equal: 10 + 0.002Q = 21 - 0.02Q.

0.022Q = 11 → Q = 11 / 0.022 → 500.

Wait, this is different. So if I set P = ATC, then Q would be 500, and P would be 21 - 0.02*500 = 21 -10 = $11. But that's option E.

Hmm, now I'm confused because I have two different approaches leading to different results.

Wait, in the first approach, I considered MC = P, which gave Q ≈458.33, P≈$11.83.

In the second approach, I considered ATC = P, which gave Q=500, P=11.

So which is correct?

In a perfectly competitive market, in the long run, firms enter or exit until P = ATC, which is the zero-profit condition. So the correct approach would be to set P = ATC.

Wait, but that's only when the firm is producing at the minimum of its ATC curve. However, in this problem, each firm's ATC is 10 + 0.002Q, which depends on the industry's Q. So perhaps the correct condition is P = ATC for each firm.

Wait, but each firm's ATC is 10 + 0.002Q, and in the long run, P must equal each firm's ATC. So setting P = 10 + 0.002Q.

But P is also from demand: P = 21 - 0.02Q.

So 21 - 0.02Q = 10 + 0.002Q.

So 21 -10 = 0.02Q + 0.002Q.

11 = 0.022Q → Q = 11 / 0.022 = 500.

Then P = 21 - 0.02*500 = 21 -10 = 11. So P = $11.

That's option E.

But this conflicts with the earlier approach where I considered MC.

Wait, but perhaps
