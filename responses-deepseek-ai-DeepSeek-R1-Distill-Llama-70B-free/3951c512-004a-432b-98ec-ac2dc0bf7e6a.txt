Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a school psychologist helping a teacher with problem behaviors. Let me try to break it down.

The question says that Ms. Smith has a class of 30 students, and 26 have had discipline referrals. That's a lotâ€”like 86% of the class. So the issue is pretty widespread. The psychologist needs to recommend something to help.

Looking at the options, I need to figure out the best approach. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Providing individual counseling to the 4 students without referrals. Wait, those 4 are the ones who aren't causing problems. Why would we focus on them? That doesn't make sense. The problem is with the majority, so A seems off.

Option B: In-school suspension for the 26. Suspension is usually a punishment, but does it address the behavior? It might just remove them from class without solving why they're misbehaving. Plus, it's a lot of students, so maybe not the best solution.

Option C: Detention for the 26. Similar to B, it's punitive. Detention might not help change the behavior; it just adds punishment. Also, managing detention for 26 kids could be tough.

Option D: Implement a class-wide behavior management plan, like a response-cost raffle. Hmm. Response-cost systems are where students lose points for misbehaving. A raffle could be a positive part where earning points leads to rewards. Since most of the class is having issues, a class-wide plan might be efficient. It can address everyone's behavior in the same setting without singling out individuals. That sounds promising.

Option E: Send 26 to an alternative school. That's a big step and probably not feasible. Also, it's a more severe measure and might not be necessary if a behavior plan could work first.

Option F: School-wide assembly on proper behavior. A one-time assembly might not have a lasting impact, especially if the problem is specific to Ms. Smith's class. It's too broad and not targeted.

Option G: Peer mediation for conflicts. While helpful for some issues, if the problem is widespread behavior, mediation alone might not address the root cause or manage the scale of the problem.

Option H: Group counseling on study skills, etc. Group counseling could help, but it might not address the immediate behavior issues in the classroom. Also, if 26 students are having problems, that's a lot for group sessions, and individual attention might be limited.

Option I: Comprehensive assessments for the referred students. Assessments are good, but they take time and might not directly address the current disruptions. The question is asking for a recommendation to help now, not just assess.

Option J: Individual behavior contracts for the 26. That could be effective, but creating 26 individual plans sounds time-consuming. It might be too much for the teacher to handle alone, especially if she's already overwhelmed.

So, considering all of this, option D seems best. A class-wide plan can manage the behavior of all students at once, reinforcing positive behavior and reducing disruptions. It's efficient and proactive, addressing the majority of the class without singling out students for punishment.

The best recommendation for the school psychologist is to implement a class-wide behavior management plan, such as a response-cost raffle. This approach addresses the widespread behavior issues efficiently by reinforcing positive behavior and reducing disruptions. It is proactive and avoids punitive measures that may not resolve the root causes.

Answer: D
