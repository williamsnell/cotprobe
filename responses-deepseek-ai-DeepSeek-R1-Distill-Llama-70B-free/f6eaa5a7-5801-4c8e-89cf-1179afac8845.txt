Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about organizational culture. The question is asking which statement is true regarding a strong organizational culture. The options are A through D. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I remember that organizational culture refers to the shared values, beliefs, and norms within an organization. A strong culture means that these elements are well-defined and widely accepted by the employees. I think a strong culture can have various effects, but I need to recall the specifics.

From what I've learned before, a strong organizational culture is often associated with positive outcomes. I think it can influence employee behavior and attitudes. So, I should consider how it affects job performance and commitment.

Option A says it's correlated with low levels of job performance. That doesn't sound right. I remember reading that when employees align with the company's culture, they tend to perform better because they're motivated and understand the expectations. So if the culture is strong, performance should be high, not low. That probably means A is incorrect.

Option B states it's correlated with low levels of job commitment. Again, that doesn't align with what I know. A strong culture usually fosters a sense of belonging and purpose, which leads to higher commitment. So B is likely not the right answer either.

Option C claims it's correlated with high levels of job performance. This makes sense because a clear and strong culture can guide employees, reduce confusion, and increase efficiency. When everyone is on the same page, the organization tends to function better, leading to higher performance. So C looks correct.

Option D suggests it has no effect on job performance or commitment. I don't think that's true because culture plays a significant role in shaping workplace dynamics. Studies and theories back the idea that culture impacts both performance and how committed employees are. So D is probably wrong.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be C. It's the one that aligns with the understanding that a strong organizational culture leads to higher job performance.

The correct answer is C. A strong organizational culture is associated with high levels of job performance because it provides clear guidance, reduces confusion, and increases efficiency, leading to better overall functioning of the organization.

Answer: C
