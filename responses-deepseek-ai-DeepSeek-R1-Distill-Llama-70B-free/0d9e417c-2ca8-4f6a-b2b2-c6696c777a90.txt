Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about Adam Smith's economic theories. The question is about how Smith reconciled his idea of the 'invisible hand' with the greed of businessmen, and whether he would support government intervention to break up conspiracies.

First, I remember that Adam Smith is known for his book "The Wealth of Nations." In it, he talks about the invisible hand, which is the idea that when individuals pursue their own self-interest in a free market, it unintentionally benefits society as a whole. So the profit motive drives people to be productive, which leads to economic growth.

But the question also mentions that Smith criticized businessmen for conspiracies against the public, like price-fixing or monopolistic practices. So how did he reconcile the profit motive, which he saw as positive, with the negative actions of some businessmen?

I think Smith believed that in a truly free market with competition, such conspiracies wouldn't last. Because if one company tries to raise prices, others can undercut them, right? Competition would prevent monopolies from forming because new businesses would enter the market to take advantage of higher prices. So maybe Smith thought that the market itself could regulate these issues without the government stepping in.

Wait, but what about when businesses collude? If all companies agree to fix prices, then competition can't stop them. But Smith might have argued that such conspiracies are difficult to sustain in the long run because it's in each company's interest to cheat and lower prices to gain more market share. So without government intervention, natural market forces would break up these conspiracies.

So looking at the options, let's go through them:

Option A: Fear of public backlash. I don't recall Smith emphasizing reputation as a main factor. He did talk about moral sentiments in another book, but that might be more related to his other work, "The Theory of Moral Sentiments." Not sure if that's the answer here.

Option B: Believed in unchecked profit motive. But Smith did criticize businessmen, so he wouldn't support it being completely unchecked.

Option C: Called for government intervention. I thought Smith was more about laissez-faire, so he probably wouldn't want the government to intervene much.

Option D: Competition regulates the profit motive, preventing conspiracies, no government intervention. This sounds right because Smith does discuss how competition keeps prices low and prevents monopolies.

Option E: Moral sentiments prevent conspiracies. That's more from his other book, but the question is about his economic system, so maybe not.

Option F: Strict regulations. Again, Smith wasn't a big supporter of heavy government regulation.

Option G: Legal monopolies. No, Smith was against monopolies.

Option H: Self-regulating economy dissolves monopolies. This seems close to D. H says no external interference, which aligns with Smith's views.

Option I: Consumers' choices disrupt conspiracies. While consumer choice matters, I think Smith relied more on competition among producers.

Option J: Economic cycles prevent conspiracies. I don't remember Smith talking about boom and bust cycles as a solution.

So between D and H. Both suggest market forces handle it. Looking back, D says competition can regulate and prevent conspiracies, no government intervention. H says the economy is self-regulating without external interference. Both seem similar, but H says the market dissolves monopolies without help.

Wait, I think Smith's main point was that competition naturally prevents such conspiracies. So D says competition can regulate, which fits. Also, D says he wouldn't call for government intervention, which matches Smith's stance.

So I think the correct answer is D.

Adam Smith's economic theory, as outlined in "The Wealth of Nations," emphasizes the role of the invisible hand, where individuals pursuing self-interest in a free market unintentionally benefit society. However, Smith also criticized businessmen for conspiracies against the public, such as price-fixing and monopolistic practices. To reconcile these ideas, Smith believed that competition in a free market would naturally regulate and prevent such conspiracies. He argued that competition would undermine monopolies and conspiracies because businesses would be incentivized to undercut each other's prices, making sustained collusion difficult. This aligns with Smith's broader support for a laissez-faire approach, where market forces rather than government intervention address economic issues.

Option D correctly captures this reasoning, as it highlights that competition can regulate the profit motive and prevent conspiracies without the need for government intervention.

Answer: D
