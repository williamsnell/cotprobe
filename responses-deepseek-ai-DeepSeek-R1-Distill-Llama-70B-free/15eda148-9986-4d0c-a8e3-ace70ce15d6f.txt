Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about a type of economy where individuals are hired for specific tasks rather than on a long-term basis. The blanks are about the term for this economy, the benefit for businesses, and the issues for the workers.

Hmm. I think the term is something like "gig economy." Yeah, I've heard that before. The gig economy refers to short-term, flexible work arrangements where people might work on a project basis or as freelancers. So the first blank should be "gig."

Now, the next part says this setup results in something beneficial for businesses. What's the benefit? Well, if they're not hiring long-term, they probably have more flexibility. They can hire people when they need them, which saves costs and allows them to adapt quickly. So the second blank is "flexibility."

Then, the issues for the workers. The question lists increased something, uncertainty, and a lack of something. I remember that gig workers often don't have the same benefits as full-time employees, like health insurance, paid time off, or retirement plans. So the last blank is probably "social welfare structures." Also, because they're not permanent, they might have less job security, which ties into "uncertainty." But what's the first issue? Maybe "risk," because each gig could end, and they might not have a steady income. So the third blank is "risk."

Putting it all together, the sentence should be: "Gig economy is the term... Flexibility which is beneficial... increased risk, uncertainty and a lack of social welfare structures."

Looking at the options, option A says: Gig, Flexibility, Risk, Social welfare structures. That fits exactly what I thought. Let me check the other options just to be sure.

Option B has Autonomy and Flexibility again, but I think autonomy isn't the right term here. Option C uses Contract economy, which I don't think is correct. Option D is Sharing economy, which is another term but refers more to sharing resources like Uber or Airbnb. So D's not right. Option E starts with Freelance economy, which is similar but I think gig is the more precise term used. F and H mention Stability, which doesn't make sense because gig work is unstable. G is Traditional economy, which is the opposite. I and J mix up some terms, but J has Risk and Flexibility but the last term is Autonomy, which doesn't fit as well as Social welfare structures.

So yes, I'm confident the correct answer is option A.

The term describing an economy where individuals are hired for specific tasks rather than long-term is the "gig economy." This setup offers businesses "flexibility," as they can adapt quickly and reduce costs. However, workers face increased "risk," uncertainty, and a lack of "social welfare structures." 

The correct answer is A. 

A: Gig, Flexibility, Risk, Social welfare structures
