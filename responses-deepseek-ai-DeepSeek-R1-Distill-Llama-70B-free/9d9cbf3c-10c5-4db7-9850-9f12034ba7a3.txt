Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating an employee's total earnings. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question says the employee worked 43 hours and earns $3.00 per hour. Oh, but wait, there's a catch—time and a half for more than 40 hours a week. Right, time and a half means you get paid 1.5 times your regular pay for overtime.

Alright, first, I think I need to split the hours into regular and overtime. Since the standard workweek is 40 hours, anything beyond that is overtime. So 43 hours total minus 40 hours regular gives 3 hours of overtime.

Now, calculating the regular pay: 40 hours times $3 per hour. Let's do that math. 40 * 3 = $120. That's straightforward.

Next, the overtime pay. For the 3 extra hours, the employee gets time and a half. Time and a half of $3 would be 3 * 1.5, which is $4.50 per hour for overtime. So 3 hours * $4.50 equals... let's see, 3 * 4.5 is 13.5. So that's $13.50 in overtime pay.

Wait, no, wait a second. Let me make sure I'm calculating that correctly. Time and a half means the employee's hourly rate is multiplied by 1.5 for overtime hours. So 3 * (3 * 1.5) = 3 * 4.5 = 13.5. Yeah, that's right.

So putting it all together, the total earnings would be regular pay plus overtime. That's $120 + $13.50, which totals $133.50.

Looking at the options provided, option A is $133.50. So I think that's the correct answer. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. 40 hours at $3 is 120, 3 at 4.5 is 13.5, sum to 133.5. Yep, that looks right.

The employee worked a total of 43 hours. The first 40 hours are paid at the regular rate of $3.00 per hour, and the remaining 3 hours are paid at time and a half, which is $4.50 per hour. 

Calculating the regular pay:  
40 hours × $3.00/hour = $120.00  

Calculating the overtime pay:  
3 hours × $4.50/hour = $13.50  

Adding both amounts gives the total earnings:  
$120.00 + $13.50 = $133.50  

The correct answer is **A: $133.50**.
