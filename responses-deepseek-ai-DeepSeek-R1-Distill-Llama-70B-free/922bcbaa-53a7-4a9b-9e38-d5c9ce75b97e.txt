Okay, so I've got this property law question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand all the details.

So, the setup is that a professor owns an apartment building in fee simple. He conveys it to his son and daughter as tenants in common. But wait, in the deed, he reserved a life estate for himself. So, I remember that a life estate means the professor has the right to use the property until he dies, and then it goes to the remaindermen, which in this case are his son and daughter as tenants in common.

Then, the professor tells his children about this conveyance and puts the deed in the family vault. So, the deed is delivered, right? Delivery is important for a deed to be effective. So, I think the first conveyance is valid.

After that, the son marries a doctor, and the professor doesn't like the doctor. So, the professor decides to execute another deed, which he calls a "correction deed." In this new deed, he conveys the apartment building to his son and daughter as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. Again, he reserves a life estate for himself. Both children accept delivery of this correction deed.

Then, six months later, the son dies intestate, leaving the doctor as his sole heir. The question is, who holds title to the apartment building now?

Hmm. So, the key points here are the two deeds and the effect of each. Let me break it down step by step.

First Conveyance:
- Professor conveys to son and daughter as tenants in common.
- He reserves a life estate, so he's keeping the right to use until his death.
- The deed is delivered and accepted. So, this should be a valid transfer. So, after this, the son and daughter each hold an equal share as tenants in common, but the professor has a life estate. So, the present possessory estate is the professor's life estate, and the future interest is the son and daughter's as tenants in common.

Second Conveyance (Correction Deed):
- Now, the professor conveys the same property again, this time as joint tenants with right of survivorship.
- Again, he reserves a life estate. Both children accept this deed.
- The question is, does this second deed have any effect? Because the professor had already transferred the property in the first deed. So, after the first conveyance, the professor only had a life estate, and the remainder was with the children. So, does he have the authority to make another conveyance that changes the remainder interest?

Wait, no. Once the first deed is effective, the professor's interest is just a life estate. So, he can't really convey the fee simple again because he no longer owns it. He only owns the life estate. Therefore, when he executes the second deed, he can only convey what he owns, which is the life estate. But wait, in the second deed, he's trying to convey the apartment building to the son and daughter as joint tenants, but he's reserving a life estate for himself again. That seems a bit confusing.

Wait, let's think again. The first deed: he conveyed the property to son and daughter as tenants in common, reserving a life estate. So, the ownership structure is:
- Professor: life estate.
- Son and daughter: each own 50% as tenants in common, in remainder.

Now, the second deed, he says he's conveying to son and daughter as joint tenants, again reserving a life estate. But does he have the authority to do that? Because after the first conveyance, he only has the life estate, so he can't convey the remainder again. So, perhaps the second deed only affects his own interest.

Wait, but the second deed is being accepted by both children. So, perhaps the second deed is modifying the first. But I'm not sure if that's possible because the first deed was already delivered and accepted. Unless the second deed is a mutual rescission or a new agreement.

Alternatively, perhaps the second deed is ineffective because the professor no longer holds the fee simple. So, he can't convey the property beyond his own interest, which is the life estate. Therefore, the second deed might not change the remainder interest.

Wait, but let me think about delivery of the deed. The first deed was delivered when he put it in the vault. The second deed was also delivered when both children accepted it. But if the first deed was already effective, then the professor can't make another conveyance that changes the remainder.

So, perhaps the second deed is an attempt to change the remainder from tenants in common to joint tenants. But does he have the authority to do that? Since he's only the life tenant, he can't alter the remainder without the agreement of the remaindermen.

Wait, another angle: when the professor executed the second deed, he might have intended to revoke the first deed. But deeds once delivered are generally not revocable unless there's mutual agreement or some other factor. Here, the first deed was delivered, so it's effective. The second deed, however, is a new conveyance. But the professor doesn't have the entire fee simple anymore; he only has a life estate.

Wait, perhaps the second deed is an attempt to transfer the property again. But in that case, the professor only owns a life estate, so he can only transfer that. But the second deed says he's conveying the apartment building as joint tenants, which would be the fee simple. But he doesn't have the fee simple; he only has a life estate. So, the second deed would be ineffective because he can't convey what he doesn't own. Therefore, the first deed stands, and the second deed is irrelevant.

But wait, the second deed could also be seen as the professor trying to exercise his power as the grantor. But once the first deed is delivered, the grantor's interest is limited to the life estate. So, he can't make another grant of the fee simple because he no longer holds it.

So, the son and daughter's interest as tenants in common remains. Then, when the son dies, his 50% share as a tenant in common would go to his heir, which is the doctor. Because as tenants in common, there's no right of survivorship. So, each owns a distinct share that can be passed on.

Wait, but the second deed tried to make them joint tenants. But since the professor couldn't convey that, the first deed's tenancy in common stands. So, upon the son's death, his share goes to his estate, and then to the doctor as his heir.

So, the current ownership would be the professor has a life estate, and the remainder is held by the daughter and the doctor as tenants in common, each owning 50%.

Looking at the options:

Option B: daughter and doctor as tenants in common, subject to the professor's life estate. That seems to fit.

Wait, but what about the second deed? If the second deed was effective, it would have made them joint tenants. But I thought the professor couldn't do that because he didn't own the fee. So, the second deed is ineffective, so the first remains.

So, yes, upon the son's death, his 50% goes to the doctor. So, the remainder is daughter (50%) and doctor (50%) as tenants in common.

So, the answer should be option B.
</think>

The professor, as the fee simple owner of an apartment building, executed two deeds. The first deed conveyed the property to his son and daughter as tenants in common, reserving a life estate for himself. This deed was properly delivered and accepted, making it effective. At this point, the ownership structure was:

- Professor: Life estate.
- Son and Daughter: Remainder interest as tenants in common.

The professor later executed a second deed, labeled a "correction deed," attempting to convey the property to his son and daughter as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, again reserving a life estate. However, after the first deed, the professor only retained a life estate and no longer held the fee simple. Therefore, he lacked the authority to alter the remainder interest. The second deed was ineffective in changing the tenancy from tenants in common to joint tenants because the professor could only convey what he ownedâ€”the life estate.

When the son died intestate, his 50% share as a tenant in common passed to his sole heir, the doctor. As a result, the current ownership of the apartment building is:

- Professor: Life estate.
- Daughter and Doctor: Remainder interest as tenants in common, each owning 50%.

Thus, the title to the apartment building is held by the daughter and the doctor as tenants in common, subject to the professor's life estate.

Answer: B
