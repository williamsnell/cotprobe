Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the average kinetic energy of a gas molecule at room temperature, and the answer needs to be in electronvolts. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it.

I remember that the average kinetic energy of a molecule in an ideal gas is related to temperature. Oh right, the formula is something like (3/2)kT, where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature in Kelvin. But wait, I'm not entirely sure if it's (3/2)kT or (5/2)kT. Wait, no, for monoatomic gases, the average translational kinetic energy is (3/2)kT. Oh wait, but the question is about a gas molecule, so it's probably assuming monoatomic, so I'll go with (3/2)kT.

Now, room temperature is typically around 25 degrees Celsius, right? So I need to convert that to Kelvin. Kelvin is Celsius plus 273.15, so 25 + 273.15 would be 298.15 K. Let me just approximate that to 298 K for simplicity.

Next, I need Boltzmann's constant, k. I think k is approximately 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K. Right. So plugging the numbers in, the average kinetic energy E is (3/2) * k * T.

Let me compute that. So (3/2) is 1.5. Multiply that by 1.38e-23 J/K and 298 K. Let's do the math step by step.

First, 1.38e-23 multiplied by 298. Let me calculate 1.38 * 298. Let's see: 1.38 * 300 is 414, but since it's 298, that's 2 less. So 1.38 *2 is 2.76, so subtract that from 414 to get 411.24. So 1.38e-23 * 298 = 411.24e-23 J, which is 4.1124e-21 J.

Wait, no, wait a second. Let me recalculate that. Because 1.38e-23 multiplied by 298 is:

1.38 * 298 = let's compute it accurately.

298 can be broken into 300 -2. So 1.38 * 300 = 414, and 1.38 * (-2) is -2.76. So 414 - 2.76 = 411.24. So yes, 1.38e-23 * 298 = 411.24e-23 J. But wait, 411.24e-23 is the same as 4.1124e-21 J.

Then multiply by 1.5 (since it's 3/2). 4.1124e-21 J * 1.5 = let's see.

4.1124 * 1.5 = 6.1686, so 6.1686e-21 J.

So the average kinetic energy is approximately 6.17e-21 J.

But the question asks for the answer in electronvolts. Oh right, I need to convert Joules to eV. I remember that 1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 J. So to convert J to eV, I divide by 1.602e-19.

So E in eV is (6.17e-21 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV).

Let's compute that. 6.17e-21 / 1.602e-19 = (6.17 / 1.602) * 1e-2.

Because 1e-21 divided by 1e-19 is 1e-2 (since 1e-21 is 1e-2 times 1e-19). So 6.17 / 1.602 is approximately, let's calculate that.

1.602 times 3 is 4.806, which is less than 6.17. 1.602 * 3.85 â‰ˆ 6.17? Let's see:

1.602 * 3 = 4.806
1.602 * 0.85 = approximately 1.3617
So 4.806 + 1.3617 = 6.1677, which is about 6.17. So 3.85.

So 3.85 * 1e-2 is 0.0385 eV.

Wait, so approximately 0.0385 eV.

Looking at the options, option H is 0.038eV. That's very close. Option H is 0.038.

Alternatively, maybe I should double-check my calculations for any possible error.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me go through it again.

E = (3/2)kT.

k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

T is 298 K.

So E = 1.5 * 1.38e-23 * 298.

Wait, 1.38e-23 * 298 = ?

1.38 * 298 = 411.24, so 411.24e-23 J.

Multiply by 1.5 gives 616.86e-23 J = 6.1686e-21 J.

Convert to eV:

6.1686e-21 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = (6.1686 / 160.2) e-2? Wait no, let me think.

Wait, 1.602e-19 J is 1 eV.

So 6.1686e-21 J = X eV.

X = 6.1686e-21 / 1.602e-19.

Which is (6.1686 / 1.602) ) * (1e-21 / 1e-19 )

1e-21 / 1e-19 = 1e-2.

6.1686 / 1.602 = approximately 3.85.

So 3.85 * 1e-2 = 0.0385 eV.

So about 0.0385 eV, which is closest to 0.038 eV, which is option H.

But wait, another thought: sometimes, room temperature is taken as about 300 K for simplicity. Let's see if that changes anything.

If T is 300 K, then E = (3/2)*1.38e-23 *300.

1.38e-23 * 300 = 4.14e-21 J.

Multiply by 1.5: 6.21e-21 J.

Convert to eV: 6.21e-21 / 1.602e-19 = approx 0.0388 eV, so 0.039 eV. So still around 0.038 to 0.039, which would match option H (0.038eV) or perhaps it's closer to 0.04, which isn't an option. The options jump from H (0.038) to G (0.075), which is much higher.

So the correct answer should be H: 0.038 eV.

To compute the average kinetic energy of a gas molecule at room temperature in electronvolts (eV), we use the formula for the average translational kinetic energy of a molecule in an ideal gas:

\[
E = \frac{3}{2}kT
\]

Where:
- \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, approximately \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \),
- \( T \) is the temperature in Kelvin.

### Step 1: Convert room temperature to Kelvin
Room temperature is typically \( 25^\circ \text{C} \), which is equivalent to:
\[
T = 25 + 273.15 = 298.15 \, \text{K} \, (\text{approximated as } 298 \, \text{K for simplicity}).
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the average kinetic energy in Joules
Substituting the values into the formula:
\[
E = \frac{3}{2} \cdot (1.38 \times 10^{-23}) \cdot 298
\]
First, calculate \( 1.38 \times 298 \):
\[
1.38 \times 298 = 411.24
\]
Thus:
\[
E = 1.5 \cdot 411.24 \times 10^{-23} = 616.86 \times 10^{-23} = 6.1686 \times 10^{-21} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 3: Convert Joules to electronvolts
To convert energy from Joules to electronvolts, use the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \):
\[
E \, (\text{in eV}) = \frac{6.1686 \times 10^{-21}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}}
\]
Simplify:
\[
E = \frac{6.1686}{1.602} \times 10^{-2} \approx 3.85 \times 10^{-2} = 0.0385 \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 4: Match the result to the closest option
The calculated value \( 0.0385 \, \text{eV} \) is closest to option **H: 0.038 eV**.

### Final Answer:
H
