Okay, so I've got this question about a CPA being asked to reissue an auditor's report for a former client. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, the scenario is that a CPA has a former audit client asking them to reissue the auditor's report from the prior period. So, the CPA isn't the current auditor anymore. Now, what should the CPA do before reissuing that report?

I remember that when an auditor's report is reissued, especially after the original date, certain procedures are necessary. The main concern here is whether any events have occurred since the original report that could affect the financial statements or the auditor's opinion.

So, the CPA needs to make sure that the financial statements haven't changed in a way that would make the old report misleading. I think the key here is obtaining some form of representation from the client's management.

Wait, let me recall the standards. I think under GAAS, if the auditor is being asked to reissue the report, say, for inclusion in a registration statement or some other document, the auditor should perform certain procedures. These might include getting a letter of representation from management, which would state that the financial statements are still accurate and that there have been no significant events since the original audit that would impact them.

Looking at the options, option C is "Obtain a letter of representation from the former client's management." That sounds right. But wait, what exactly does the letter include? Oh right, the management should represent that the financial statements and the auditor's report are still applicable, and that there have been no material changes or events that would require adjustments or affect the auditor's opinion.

Other options: Option B says to request permission from the current auditor. I'm not sure if that's required. The CPA is the former auditor; maybe they don't need the current auditor's permission, but perhaps they should inform them or consider their opinion. But the question is about what the CPA should do before reissuing, and the primary action is about ensuring the report is still valid, which points back to management representation.

Option D says to review the current financial statements. Well, the CPA isn't auditing the current period, just reissuing the prior report. So maybe they don't need to review the current statements unless there's a reason to believe the prior ones are affected.

Option H mentions checking compliance with debt agreements. That seems more related to the audit procedures during the initial audit, not necessarily when reissuing the report later.

Options A, E, F, G are about reputation, credit history, consulting shareholders, and financial stability. I don't think these are directly relevant to the reissuance of the report. The CPA's main concern is whether the previous report is still accurate and valid, which ties back to getting a representation letter.

So, putting it all together, the CPA should obtain a letter of representation from the former client's management. That would be option C.

The CPA should obtain a letter of representation from the former client's management before reissuing the auditor's report. This ensures that the financial statements remain accurate and that no significant events have occurred since the original audit that would affect the report's validity.
