Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the voltage across a capacitor at a specific time. I'm a bit rusty on my electronics, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The capacitor is 0.01 microfarads. Oh wait, micro is 10^-6, so that's 0.01e-6 farads, which is 1e-8 F. The time given is t = 0.25 microseconds, which is 0.25e-6 seconds. The initial voltage, nu(o), is 0.6 volts. There are three parts: (a), (b), and (c), each with different current functions. I need to find the voltage for each case.

I remember that the relationship between current and voltage in a capacitor is based on the equation i = C * dv/dt. Rearranging this, the voltage across the capacitor is the integral of i(t) dt multiplied by 1/C, plus the initial voltage. So the formula would be v(t) = v(0) + (1/C) * integral of i(t) dt from 0 to t.

Let me handle each part one by one.

Starting with part (a): current is 0.2 sin(2π * 10^6 t) A. Hmm. So I need to integrate this current with respect to time.

The integral of sin(ax) dx is (-1/a) cos(ax) + constant. So the integral of 0.2 sin(2πe6 t) dt would be (0.2/(2πe6)) * (-cos(2πe6 t)) + C. But wait, the integral bounds are from 0 to t, so the definite integral is evaluated at t minus at 0.

Let me compute the definite integral:

Integral from 0 to t of i(t) dt = [ (-0.2/(2πe6)) cos(2πe6 t) ) ] from 0 to t.

That's (-0.2/(2πe6))(cos(2πe6 t) - cos(0)).

Cos(0) is 1, so it becomes (-0.2/(2πe6))(cos(2πe6 t) -1).

Then the voltage v(t) is 0.6 V plus (1/C) multiplied by this integral.

Wait, but wait, I think I might be mixing up the signs. Let me double-check. The integral of i(t) dt is the charge that flows, and since i = C dv/dt, integrating i gives Q = C (v(t) - v(0)). So v(t) = v(0) + (1/C) * integral of i(t) dt.

So let's compute the integral for part (a):

i(t) = 0.2 sin(2πe6 t)

Integral i(t) dt from 0 to t is:

I = ∫0^t 0.2 sin(2πe6 t') dt'

= 0.2 * [ -1/(2πe6) cos(2πe6 t') ] from 0 to t

= 0.2/(2πe6) [ -cos(2πe6 t) + cos(0) ]

= (0.2/(2πe6)) (1 - cos(2πe6 t))

Because cos(0) is 1, and the negative signs would flip.

Now, multiply this by (1/C), which is 1/(1e-8 F) = 1e8 F^-1.

So v(t) = 0.6 + (1e8) * (0.2/(2πe6)) (1 - cos(2πe6 t)).

Let me compute the constants:

0.2 / (2πe6) = 0.2 / (2 * π * 1e6) ≈ 0.2 / (6.283e6) ≈ 3.183e-8.

Multiply by 1e8: 3.183e-8 * 1e8 = 3.183.

So the term becomes 3.183 * (1 - cos(2πe6 t)).

So v(t) = 0.6 + 3.183 (1 - cos(2πe6 t)).

Now, plug in t=0.25e-6 s.

Compute the argument inside cos: 2πe6 * 0.25e-6 = 2π * (e6 * 0.25e-6) = 2π * 0.25 = π/2.

Cos(π/2) is zero.

So 1 - cos(...) = 1 - 0 = 1.

So v(0.25e-6) = 0.6 + 3.183 * 1 = 0.6 + 3.183 = 3.783 V.

Looking at the options, that's approximately 3.78 V for part (a). Let me check the options. Looking at option A: (a) 3.78 V. Option G also has (a) 2.44 V, so that's not it. So part (a) is 3.78 V.

Moving to part (b): current is 0.2 e^(-10^7 t) A. Hmm, exponent with negative sign. So I need to integrate this.

So the integral of i(t) dt is ∫0^t 0.2 e^(-1e7 t') dt'.

The integral of e^(kt) dt is (1/k)e^(kt), so here k is -1e7.

So integral becomes 0.2 * [ (1/(-1e7)) e^(-1e7 t') ] from 0 to t.

= 0.2 * (1/(-1e7)) [ e^(-1e7 t) - e^(0) ]

= 0.2 * (-1/(1e7)) (e^(-1e7 t) - 1 )

= (0.2 * (-1e-7)) (e^(-1e7 t) - 1 )

= ( -0.2e-7 ) (e^(-1e7 t) -1 )

Multiply by 1/C (1e8):

(1e8) * [ -0.2e-7 (e^(-1e7 t) -1) ] 

= 1e8 * (-0.2e-7) (e^(-1e7 t) -1 )

Simplify the constants: 1e8 * (-0.2e-7) = (1e8) * (-2e-8) )= -2.

So the term becomes -2 (e^(-1e7 t) -1 ) = -2 e^(-1e7 t) + 2.

So v(t) = 0.6 + (-2 e^(-1e7 t) + 2 )

= 0.6 + 2 - 2 e^(-1e7 t )

= 2.6 - 2 e^(-1e7 t )

Now plug in t=0.25e-6 s.

Compute exponent: 1e7 * 0.25e-6 = 1e7 * 0.25e-6 = 2.5.

Wait wait, wait 1e7 is 10^7, 0.25e-6 is 0.25 * 1e-6.

Multiply them: (1e7) * (0.25e-6) = (1e7) * (2.5e-7) )= 0.25 * (1e7 * 1e-7) )= 0.25 * 1 = 0.25. Wait, wait, no:

Wait, 1e7 * 0.25e-6 = 1e7 * 0.25 * 1e-6 = (1e7 * 1e-6) ) * 0.25 = (1e1) * 0.25 = 0.25 *10 = 2.5.

Ah, so the exponent is -2.5.

So e^(-2.5) ≈ e^-2.5 ≈ 0.082085.

So v(t) = 2.6 - 2 * 0.082085 ≈ 2.6 - 0.16417 ≈ 2.4358 V, approximately 2.44 V.

Looking at the options, part (b) is 2.44 V. So that matches.

Now part (c): current is 0.2 A for 0 ≤ t ≤3 μs. So it's a constant current.

Since the current is constant, the voltage across the capacitor will increase linearly. The formula is v(t) = v(0) + (i/C)*t.

Wait, because i=C dv/dt → dv/dt = i/C → dv = (i/C) dt → integrating from 0 to t gives v(t) = v(0) + (i/C) t.

So i=0.2 A, C=1e-8 F. So (i/C) = 0.2 / 1e-8 = 2e6 V/s.

Time t=0.25e-6 s.

So v(t) = 0.6 + (2e6) * 0.25e-6.

Compute that: 2e6 * 0.25e-6 = 2 * 0.25 * (1e6 * 1e-6) )= 0.5 * 1 = 0.5 V.

So v(t) = 0.6 + 0.5 = 1.1 V? Wait, wait that can't be right. Wait no, wait a second. Let me compute again.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Because 2e6 * 0.25e-6.

Wait 2e6 is 2,000,000. 0.25e-6 is 0.00000025.

Multiply them: 2e6 * 0.25e-6 = (2 * 0.25) * (1e6 * 1e-6) )= 0.5 * 1 = 0.5 V.

So 0.6 + 0.5 = 1.1 V. Hmm, but looking at the options, none of the (c) parts are 1.1 V.

Wait wait, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check.

Wait, the current is 0.2 A, correct. C is 0.01 μF which is 1e-8 F, correct. So (i/C) is 0.2 / 1e-8 = 2e6 V/s, correct.

t is 0.25 μs = 0.25e-6 s.

Multiply 2e6 by 0.25e-6: 2e6 * 0.25e-6 = 2 * 0.25 * (1e6 * 1e-6) )= 0.5 * 1 = 0.5 V.

So v(t)=0.6 +0.5=1.1 V. But none of the options have 1.1 V for part (c). Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, because the current is 0.2 A. So for a capacitor, v(t) = v(0) + (1/C) * integral of i dt. Since i is constant, integral is i*t. So v(t)=0.6 + (0.2 * t ) / C.

Wait, no, wait. The formula is v(t) = v(0) + (1/C) * integral of i(t) dt. So integral of i=0.2 is 0.2 t. So (1/C) * 0.2 t is 0.2 t / C.

Wait, C is 1e-8 F. So 0.2 * t / 1e-8.

t is 0.25e-6 s. So 0.2 * 0.25e-6 / 1e-8.

Compute that:

0.2 * 0.25e-6 = 0.05e-6 = 5e-8.

Divide by 1e-8: 5e-8 / 1e-8 =5.

So v(t)=0.6 +5 =5.6 V.

Ah, wait a minute! I must have messed up the calculation earlier. Oh right, because I think I forgot to multiply by 1/C in the previous step. Let me redo this.

Wait, v(t) = v(0) + (1/C) * ∫i dt.

∫i dt from 0 to t is I = i * t = 0.2 * 0.25e-6 = 5e-8 C (coulombs).

Then (1/C) * I = (1 / 1e-8 F) * 5e-8 C = (5e-8) / 1e-8 =5 V.

So v(t)=0.6 +5=5.6 V. That makes more sense. So part (c) is 5.6 V.

Wait, so compiling the results:

(a) 3.78 V, (b) 2.44 V, (c) 5.6 V.

Looking at the options, option A has (a)3.78, (b)2.44, (c)5.6. So option A is the correct answer.

To solve the problem, we calculate the voltage across the capacitor for each given current using the relationship:

\[
v(t) = v(0) + \frac{1}{C} \int_0^t i(t') \, dt'
\]

where \( C = 0.01 \, \mu\text{F} = 1 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{F} \), \( v(0) = 0.6 \, \text{V} \), and \( t = 0.25 \, \mu\text{s} = 0.25 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{s} \). The calculations for each part are as follows:

---

### (a) \( i(t) = 0.2 \sin(2\pi \times 10^6 t) \, \text{A} \)

The integral of \( \sin(ax) \) is \( -\frac{1}{a} \cos(ax) \). Thus:

\[
\int_0^t 0.2 \sin(2\pi \times 10^6 t') \, dt' = \frac{0.2}{2\pi \times 10^6} \left[ 1 - \cos(2\pi \times 10^6 t) \right]
\]

Substituting \( t = 0.25 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{s} \):

\[
\cos(2\pi \times 10^6 \times 0.25 \times 10^{-6}) = \cos(\pi/2) = 0
\]

Thus:

\[
\int_0^t i(t') \, dt' = \frac{0.2}{2\pi \times 10^6} \left[ 1 - 0 \right] = \frac{0.2}{2\pi \times 10^6}
\]

The voltage is:

\[
v(t) = 0.6 + \frac{1}{1 \times 10^{-8}} \cdot \frac{0.2}{2\pi \times 10^6}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
v(t) = 0.6 + 3.183 \approx 3.78 \, \text{V}
\]

---

### (b) \( i(t) = 0.2 e^{-(10^7)t} \, \text{A} \)

The integral of \( e^{-(10^7)t} \) is \( -\frac{1}{10^7} e^{-(10^7)t} \). Thus:

\[
\int_0^t 0.2 e^{-(10^7)t'} \, dt' = \frac{0.2}{10^7} \left[ 1 - e^{-(10^7)t} \right]
\]

Substituting \( t = 0.25 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{s} \):

\[
10^7 \cdot 0.25 \times 10^{-6} = 2.5 \quad \text{and} \quad e^{-2.5} \approx 0.0821
\]

Thus:

\[
\int_0^t i(t') \, dt' = \frac{0.2}{10^7} \left[ 1 - 0.0821 \right] = \frac{0.2}{10^7} \cdot 0.9179
\]

The voltage is:

\[
v(t) = 0.6 + \frac{1}{1 \times 10^{-8}} \cdot \frac{0.2}{10^7} \cdot 0.9179
\]

Simplifying:

\[
v(t) = 0.6 + 2.44 \approx 2.44 \, \text{V}
\]

---

### (c) \( i(t) = 0.2 \, \text{A} \) for \( 0 \leq t \leq 3 \, \mu\text{s} \)

For constant current, the voltage increases linearly:

\[
v(t) = v(0) + \frac{i \cdot t}{C}
\]

Substituting \( i = 0.2 \, \text{A} \), \( t = 0.25 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{s} \), and \( C = 1 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{F} \):

\[
v(t) = 0.6 + \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25 \times 10^{-6}}{1 \times 10^{-8}}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
v(t) = 0.6 + 5 = 5.6 \, \text{V}
\]

---

### Final Results

- (a) \( 3.78 \, \text{V} \)
- (b) \( 2.44 \, \text{V} \)
- (c) \(
