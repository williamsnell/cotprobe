Okay, so I'm trying to answer this biology question about how aquatic plants regulate their water content when their protoplasm is hypertonic compared to the surrounding water. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that hypertonic means the plant cells have a higher concentration of solutes than the water they're in. So water should flow into the plant cells by osmosis, right? Because water moves from a hypotonic solution (the surrounding water) to a hypertonic solution (the plant cells) through a semipermeable membrane.

Wait, but the question says the amount of water in the plant cells remains constant. That means there's some mechanism balancing the water influx. So, what regulates this?

I think about osmoregulation in plants. In land plants, they lose water through transpiration, and the roots take in water. But these are aquatic plants, so maybe they don't lose much water through transpiration. Oh, but wait, being in water, they might have a different system.

I remember something about turgor pressure. When a plant cell gains water, the turgor pressure increases. This pressure is exerted against the cell wall. If the cell wall can't expand anymore, the pressure might prevent further water uptake. So turgor pressure could be a regulating factor.

Another thought: osmosis is driven by osmotic pressure. The cell's osmotic pressure is higher, so water comes in until the cell's turgor pressure balances it. So maybe the turgor pressure is what stops the influx once it's enough.

Wait, but let's think about the options. Option A says osmotic pressure regulates the influx. Osmotic pressure is the driving force, but how does it regulate? Maybe it's the equilibrium point. So when the cell's turgor pressure equals the osmotic pressure, water stops flowing in.

Wait, no, because in a hypertonic solution, the cell would continuously take in water until... Unless something else stops it. Oh, but in reality, plant cells have cell walls that prevent over-expansion. So the turgor pressure (the pressure inside the cell pushing against the wall) would increase as water enters. Once it's enough, maybe the cell stops taking in water because the turgor pressure resists further influx.

So the regulation is due to turgor pressure. So option B might be the answer.

Other options: let's see. Option C is aquaporins. They are channels that allow water to flow faster. They can regulate the rate, but do they stop the influx? I'm not sure if they're the main regulators in this case.

Option D is active transport. But water usually moves via osmosis, which is passive. Active transport uses energy, which isn't typically involved in water movement unless under certain conditions.

Option E, plasmolysis, is when the cell loses water and shrinks. But the question is about maintaining constant water, so maybe not.

Option F, capillary action, is about water movement through narrow spaces, like in xylem vessels, but I don't think it's the main factor here.

Option G, diffusion of solutes. Solute movement could affect osmotic pressure, but the question is about water influx regulation.

Option H, guard cells, are involved in stomatal opening and gas exchange, not directly in water uptake in aquatic plants.

Option I, contractile vacuoles. I remember they're in some protists to expel excess water. Do aquatic plants have them? I think higher plants, especially, rely more on cell walls and turgor pressure, so maybe this isn't the case here.

Option J, cell wall. The cell wall does provide rigidity and resists expansion, but the actual force comes from the turgor pressure. So the regulation is via turgor pressure, not the cell wall itself.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be B: Turgor pressure regulates the influx of water.

In aquatic plants with hypertonic protoplasm, water flows into the cells via osmosis due to the higher solute concentration inside the cells compared to the surrounding water. However, the amount of water in the plant cells remains constant, indicating a regulatory mechanism. 

As water enters the cells, turgor pressure increases. This pressure is exerted by the cell contents against the cell wall. When turgor pressure rises to a point where it balances the osmotic pressure driving water influx, further water uptake is halted. This equilibrium prevents over-expansion of the cell and maintains a stable water level. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A (Osmotic pressure):** While osmotic pressure drives water influx, it is not the regulatory mechanism that halts water entry.
- **B (Turgor pressure):** Correct, as turgor pressure increases with water entry and regulates influx by balancing osmotic pressure.
- **C (Aquaporins):** These channels facilitate water flow but do not primarily regulate the halt in water influx.
- **D (Active transport):** Water movement is typically passive via osmosis, not actively transported.
- **E (Plasmolysis):** This occurs during water loss, not when water content is constant.
- **F (Capillary action):** Relevant to water movement in narrow spaces, not the regulation of water influx in this context.
- **G (Diffusion of solutes):** Solute movement affects osmotic pressure but does not directly regulate water influx.
- **H (Guard cells):** Involved in gas exchange, not water regulation in aquatic plants.
- **I (Contractile vacuoles):** Found in protists, not typically in aquatic plants.
- **J (Cellulose wall):** Provides structural support but does not directly regulate water influx.

The correct answer is **B: Turgor pressure regulates the influx of water**.
