Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about sorting algorithms and their time complexities. Hmm, I need to figure out which algorithm has a worst-case time of Θ(n²) but an average case of Θ(n log n). Let me think through each option.

First, I remember that different sorting algorithms have different time complexities. Worst-case and average-case can vary. So the question is looking for an algorithm where the worst is quadratic, but average is n log n.

Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A: Counting Sort. I think Counting Sort is usually O(n + k), where k is the range of the input. So it's linear in time, but only works when the range isn't much bigger than the number of elements. It's not comparison-based, so probably not the answer. Its worst case is linear, not quadratic.

Option B: Shell Sort. Shell sort is a generalization of insertion sort. I recall that its worst-case time is O(n²), but with certain increments, it can perform better. The average case is O(n log n), I think. So maybe this is a candidate.

Option C: Insertion Sort. Insertion sort has a worst-case time of O(n²), which is when the array is in reverse order. The average case, though, is also O(n²). So that doesn't fit because the question wants average to be n log n.

Option D: Bubblesort. Similar to insertion sort. Worst-case and average are both O(n²). So not the right answer.

Option E: Mergesort. Mergesort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in both worst and average cases. So that's not it since the question's worst case is n squared.

Option F: Selection Sort. Selection sort also has O(n²) in both cases. So no.

Option G: Bucket Sort. Bucket sort has an average case of O(n + k), where k is the number of buckets, but if the input isn't uniformly distributed, the worst case can be O(n²). Wait, but average is O(n), not n log n. So probably not the one.

Option H: Radix Sort. Radix is non-comparison and has O(nk) time, where k is the number of digits. So average and worst case would be linear, not n log n.

Option I: Quicksort. Oh right, quicksort is interesting. The worst-case time is O(n²), which happens when the pivot is chosen poorly, like always the smallest or largest element, leading to a highly unbalanced tree. But on average, with a good pivot selection (like using a median-of-three), the time is O(n log n). So this fits the description. Quicksort's average is n log n, worst is n squared.

Option J: Heapsort. Heapsort has O(n log n) in both worst and average cases. So not our answer.

So the options that fit are B and I. Wait, the question is about which one has worst-case Θ(n²) but average Θ(n log n). So Shell sort's average is O(n log n) but I'm not sure if it's Θ or just O. Or perhaps I should think about the exact average case.

Wait, Shell sort's average performance depends on the gap sequence used. For example, some gap sequences give an average time of O(n log n), but I think the worst case is O(n²). So yes, Shell sort would fit the description.

But then, the question is which algorithm has that behavior. So both Quicksort and Shell Sort have that. Hmm, but looking back, the question asks for which algorithm has those properties. So perhaps it's either option I (Quicksort) or B (Shell Sort).

Wait, the question is about the average case being Θ(n log n). Shell sort's average case is O(n log n), but is it Θ? Or is it that the average is Θ(n log n). Hmm, maybe I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, in terms of Big Theta, which means both upper and lower bounds. So for average case, it's proportional to n log n.

Quicksort, on average, is Θ(n log n). Shell sort's average is also Θ(n log n) with certain gap sequences. So both B and I might fit, but the question is which one is correct.

Wait the options are A to J, and the choices include both B and I. Wait, the question is which of the following algorithms. So perhaps both B and I are correct, but the options only provide one correct answer.

Wait, but the options are separate. So looking at the options, the problem is to choose between Quicksort (I) and Shell Sort (B).

Wait, the question is about the worst case being Θ(n²) and average Θ(n log n). So Quicksort's worst case is indeed Θ(n²), and average is Θ(n log n). Shell sort's worst case is Θ(n²), and average is Θ(n log n) as well, but I think the average is more like O(n log n), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is I: Quicksort. Because when people think of average case n log n and worst case n squared, they usually think of Quicksort. Shell sort is less commonly discussed in that context.

So I think the answer is I: Quicksort.

To determine which algorithm has a worst-case running time of Θ(n²) and an average-case running time of Θ(n log n), we analyze the given options:

- **A: Counting Sort**: This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n + k), where k is the range of the input. It is linear in time and not comparison-based, so it does not fit the criteria.

- **B: Shell Sort**: Shell sort is a variation of insertion sort. Its worst-case time complexity is O(n²), and with certain gap sequences, its average-case time complexity is O(n log n). This makes it a candidate.

- **C: Insertion Sort**: Insertion sort has a worst-case time complexity of O(n²), but its average-case time complexity is also O(n²). Thus, it does not meet the requirement of having an average-case time complexity of Θ(n log n).

- **D: Bubblesort**: Similar to insertion sort, bubblesort has a worst-case and average-case time complexity of O(n²). Therefore, it does not fit the criteria.

- **E: Mergesort**: Mergesort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in both worst and average cases. Since the question specifies a worst-case time complexity of Θ(n²), mergesort is not the correct answer.

- **F: Selection Sort**: Selection sort has a time complexity of O(n²) in both worst and average cases, so it does not meet the criteria.

- **G: Bucket Sort**: Bucket sort has an average-case time complexity of O(n + k), where k is the number of buckets. While its worst-case time complexity can be O(n²) under poor input distributions, its average-case time complexity is not Θ(n log n), so it is not the correct answer.

- **H: Radix Sort**: Radix sort is a non-comparison-based algorithm with a time complexity of O(nk), where k is the number of digits. Its time complexity is linear rather than Θ(n log n), so it does not fit.

- **I: Quicksort**: Quicksort has a worst-case time complexity of Θ(n²) when the pivot is chosen poorly, but its average-case time complexity is Θ(n log n) with good pivot selection strategies. This matches the criteria.

- **J: Heapsort**: Heapsort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in both worst and average cases. Since the question specifies a worst-case time complexity of Θ(n²), heapsort is not the correct answer.

Both **B: Shell Sort** and **I: Quicksort** fit the criteria of having a worst-case time complexity of Θ(n²) and an average-case time complexity of Θ(n log n). However, quicksort is more commonly associated with this behavior, making it the most likely intended answer.
