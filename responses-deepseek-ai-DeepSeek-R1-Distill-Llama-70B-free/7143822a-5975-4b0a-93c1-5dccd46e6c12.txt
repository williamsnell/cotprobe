Okay, so I have this problem about VSWR on a transmission line, and I need to find the reflection coefficient and the load impedance. Let's see what I remember about this.

Alright, VSWR stands for Voltage Standing Wave Ratio. I think it's the ratio of the maximum voltage to the minimum voltage in the standing wave pattern along the transmission line. The formula for VSWR is (V_max)/(V_min). And I remember that VSWR (s) is related to the reflection coefficient (Γ) by the equation s = (1 + |Γ|)/(1 - |Γ|). So if I know s, I can find |Γ|.

In this problem, the VSWR is 2. So s=2. Plugging into the formula: 2 = (1 + Γ)/(1 - Γ). Let me solve for Γ. Multiply both sides by (1-Γ): 2(1-Γ) = 1 + Γ. Expanding: 2 - 2Γ = 1 + Γ. Bring terms together: 2-1 = 2Γ + Γ → 1=3Γ → Γ=1/3. So the magnitude of the reflection coefficient is 1/3. But I also need to find the phase or the sign. Hmm.

Wait, the reflection coefficient Γ is a complex number. Its magnitude is 1/3, but the sign depends on whether the load impedance is higher or lower than the characteristic impedance. Because if the load impedance is higher than the characteristic (like an open or higher resistance), the reflection would be positive. If it's lower, negative. But wait, in terms of voltage reflection, when the impedance is higher than the line's, the voltage reflects positively. So if Z_L > Z0, Γ is positive; if Z_L < Z0, Γ is negative.

But wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again. The reflection coefficient Γ_L is given by (Z_L - Z0)/(Z_L + Z0). So if Z_L > Z0, then (Z_L - Z0) is positive, so Γ_L is positive. If Z_L < Z0, Γ_L is negative. So the sign of Γ depends on that.

Now, I need to find the load impedance Z_L. The options have various impedances, some with real and imaginary parts. So the load is complex, meaning it's not just a resistor but probably has reactance.

The problem also gives the distance between successive voltage minima as 40 cm. I remember that the distance between two successive minima (or maxima) is half a wavelength. So 40 cm is half a wavelength, meaning the wavelength λ is 80 cm. But wait, wait. Or is it that the distance between minima is half the wavelength? Because the standing wave pattern repeats every half wavelength for the minima. So λ/2 = 40 cm, so λ=80 cm.

The distance from the load to the first voltage minimum is 10 cm. I think that the first voltage minimum occurs at a distance d from the load, where d is (λ/4) multiplied by an odd integer. Wait, no, the position of the first minimum depends on the reflection. For a purely resistive load, the first minimum would be at λ/4 if the load is less than Z0, I think. But since the load is complex here, maybe there's a phase shift involved.

Wait, the voltage minima occur where the reflected wave and the incident wave interfere destructively. The position of the first minimum can be found using the formula: 

d = ( (1/2π) * arctan( (2 Z0 Im(Γ)) / (Z0^2 (1 - |Γ|^2) + (Re(Γ) Z0)^2 ) ) ) * λ/4 )

Wait, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, I remember that the distance from the load to the first minimum is given by d = (λ/4) * ( (1 - |Γ| ) / (1 + |Γ| ) ) ) * something... Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the phase of the reflection coefficient. The reflection coefficient can be expressed as Γ = |Γ| e^{jθ}, where θ is the phase angle. The position of the first voltage minimum can help determine θ.

Wait, another approach: The voltage standing wave ratio is given, and the distance between minima is known, so perhaps the phase angle of Γ can be determined from the position of the first minimum.

The formula for the distance from the load to the first voltage minimum is d = (λ/4) * ( (1 - |Γ| ) / (1 + |Γ| ) ) ) * (1 + something). Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, the distance from the load to the first minimum is (λ/4) * (1 - s) / (1 + s), but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another thought: The phase of the reflection coefficient affects the position of the minima. The reflection coefficient's phase can be found using the position of the first minimum. The formula is d = (λ/(4π)) * arctan( (2 Im(Γ)) / (1 - |Γ|^2) ). Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the reflection coefficient's angle and how it affects the standing wave.

Alternatively, I remember that the impedance at the load is Z_L = Z0 (1 + Γ_L) / (1 - Γ_L). But since I don't know Γ_L's phase yet, I might need another equation.

Wait, the reflection coefficient Γ_L is given by (Z_L - Z0)/(Z_L + Z0). So if I can express Z_L in terms of the given data, I can find Γ_L.

But maybe I can find the phase of Γ_L from the position of the first minimum. Let me think about the phase of Γ. The phase is determined by the type of load. If the load has a susceptance (reactive), then the phase will be non-zero.

Wait, the distance between successive minima is 40 cm, which is λ/2. So λ = 80 cm. The frequency f is related to the speed of light c by λ = c/f. But perhaps I don't need the frequency, just the wavelength.

The distance from the load to the first minimum is 10 cm. Let's denote this as d = 10 cm.

I think the general formula for the position of the first voltage minimum is given by:

d = (λ/4) * ( (1 - |Γ| ) / (1 + |Γ| ) ) * something. Or perhaps, the position of the first minimum depends on the reflection coefficient's phase.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The voltage in the transmission line as a function of distance x from the load is V(x) = V0 [e^{jβx} + Γ_L e^{-jβx} ].

The minima occur where the voltage magnitude is minimum, which happens when the two terms are out of phase. The condition for a minimum is that the phase difference is (2n+1)π, where n is an integer.

So, at a minimum, the derivative of |V(x)|^2 with respect to x is zero. Alternatively, taking the phasor sum, the condition is:

V(x) = V0 [ e^{jβx} + Γ_L e^{-jβx} ].

The magnitude squared is |V(x)|^2 = |V0|^2 [ (1 + |Γ_L|^2 ) + 2 Re(Γ_L e^{-j2βx} ) ].

To find the minima, the real part Re(Γ_L e^{-j2βx} ) must be negative and maximum in magnitude. So the derivative of this with respect to x would be zero.

Alternatively, the minima occur when the phase of (1 + Γ_L e^{-j2βx}) is such that the real part is minimized.

Wait, perhaps the condition for minima is when the phase of (1 + Γ_L e^{-j2βx}) is equal to (2n+1)π.

But perhaps an easier approach is to consider that the first minimum occurs at a distance d from the load, so 2βd = θ + π, where θ is the phase of Γ_L.

Wait, maybe I should write Γ_L as |Γ| e^{jθ}.

The condition for a minimum is when the reflected and incident waves are out of phase, leading to destructive interference.

So, the condition is that 2βx + θ = π (mod 2π), where x is the distance from the load.

So, 2βx = π - θ + 2π n, for integer n.

The first minimum (n=0) is at x = (π - θ)/(2β).

But β is the phase constant, which is 2π/λ. So β = 2π/(λ).

So x = (π - θ) * λ/(4π) ) = ( (π - θ) λ )/(4π) ) = ( (1 - θ/π ) λ ) /4.

Wait, that doesn't make sense dimensionally. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, β = 2π/λ. So 2βx = 2*(2π/λ)*x. So 2βx = (4π x)/λ.

So the condition is 4π x/λ = π - θ + 2π n.

Divide both sides by π: 4x/λ = 1 - θ/π + 2n.

Solving for x when n=0: x = (λ/4)(1 - θ/π).

Hmm. So x = (λ/4)(1 - θ/π).

In this problem, the first minimum is at x = 10 cm, and the distance between minima is 40 cm, which is λ/2. So λ = 80 cm.

So plugging into x:

10 cm = (80 cm /4) (1 - θ/π )

→ 10 = 20 (1 - θ/π )

Divide both sides by 20: 0.5 = 1 - θ/π.

→ θ/π = 1 - 0.5 → θ/π = 0.5 → θ = π/2 radians.

So the phase θ of Γ_L is π/2 radians, which is 90 degrees. So Γ_L has a phase of -90 degrees, because θ could be negative. Wait, wait. Because the reflection coefficient's phase is θ = arg(Γ_L). So if θ is π/2, then Γ_L would be positive imaginary. But wait, in the formula, when I derived 2βx + θ = π, I'm not sure if I got the sign right. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the condition for the first minimum is when the phase of the total voltage is such that the incident and reflected waves cancel as much as possible. So perhaps the phase is θ = -π/2. Let me think again.

Wait, let's re-examine the condition. The total voltage is V(x) = e^{jβx} + Γ_L e^{-jβx}.

We can write this as V(x) = e^{-jβx} (e^{j2βx} + Γ_L).

The minima occur when e^{j2βx} + Γ_L = 0.

So e^{j2βx} = -Γ_L.

Taking magnitudes: |e^{j2βx}| = |Γ_L| → 1=|Γ_L|, but we know |Γ_L|=1/3, not 1. Hmm, that might not be the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the reflection causing a phase shift. If the load is capacitive, the reflection would have a negative phase.

Wait, another approach: The reflection coefficient Γ_L can be written as |Γ| e^{jθ}. The phase θ can be determined from the position of the first minimum.

The distance from the load to the first minimum is d = 10 cm. The distance between minima is 40 cm, so λ/2=40 cm → λ=80 cm.

The formula relating d, λ, and θ is d = (λ/4) * ( (1 - |Γ| ) / (1 + |Γ| ) ) ) when θ=0, but when θ is not zero, it's adjusted.

Wait, I think when the reflection coefficient is real (like when the load is purely resistive), the first minimum is at d = (λ/4) * (1 - |Γ|)/(1 + |Γ|). But when Γ is complex, this formula adjusts based on the phase.

Wait, perhaps the general formula is d = (λ/(4π)) * arctan( (2 Im(Γ)) / (1 - |Γ|^2) ) ) * (1 + |Γ| )/(1 - |Γ| ). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, I found a formula that the distance from the load to the first minimum is d = (λ/4) * (1 - |Γ| )/(1 + |Γ| ) * (1 + (1/π) arctan( (Im(Γ)/(1 - |Γ|^2) )) ). But I'm not confident about this.

Wait, maybe I should refer back to the condition that at the first minimum, the phase condition is 2βd + θ = π.

So 2*(2π/λ)*d + θ = π.

We have d=10 cm, λ=80 cm.

So 2*(2π/80)*10 + θ = π → (40π/80)*10 + θ = π → (0.5π)*10 + θ = π → 5π + θ = π → θ = π -5π → θ= -4π. But that can't be right because angles are modulo 2π. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the condition.

Wait, maybe the condition is 2βd - θ = π, or something else. Let's think about the phase.

The voltage is V(x) = e^{jβx} + Γ_L e^{-jβx}.

The magnitude is |V(x)|^2 = |1 + Γ_L e^{-j2βx}|^2.

The minima occur when the real part of (1 + Γ_L e^{-j2βx}) is minimized. So the real part is Re(1 + Γ e^{-j2βx}) = 1 + Re(Γ e^{-j2βx}).

We want this to be as small as possible, which happens when Re(Γ e^{-j2βx}) is as negative as possible. The minimum occurs when the phase of Γ e^{-j2βx} is π, making the real part -|Γ|.

So the condition is that the argument of Γ e^{-j2βx} is π. So arg(Γ) - 2βx = π.

So arg(Γ) - 2*(2π/λ)*x = π.

We have x = 10 cm, λ=80 cm.

So arg(Γ) - 2*(2π/80)*10 = π.

Let me compute 2*(2π/80)*10: 40π/80 *10 = 0.5π *10 =5π.

So arg(Γ) -5π = π → arg(Γ) = 6π → which modulo 2π is 0. So arg(Γ)=0. But that can't be right because the options have Γ as purely imaginary. Hmm, maybe I messed up the condition.

Wait, perhaps the condition is arg(Γ) - 2βx ≡ π mod 2π.

So arg(Γ) - (4π x)/λ = π mod 2π.

Plugging x=10 cm, λ=80 cm:

arg(Γ) - (4π *10)/80 = π → arg(Γ) - (40π/80) = π → arg(Γ) - 0.5π = π → arg(Γ) = 1.5π → which is equivalent to -π/2.

So Γ has a phase of -π/2, which is -90 degrees. So Γ is a negative imaginary number. Because e^{-jπ/2} = -j.

So Γ_L = |Γ| * e^{-jπ/2} → since |Γ| is 1/3, Γ_L = (-j)/3.

So reflection coefficient is Γ_L = -j/3.

Now, to find Z_L, the load impedance. The formula is Z_L = Z0 (1 + Γ_L)/(1 - Γ_L).

Z0 is 50 ohms.

So plugging in Γ_L = -j/3:

1 + Γ_L = 1 - j/3 = (3 - j)/3.

1 - Γ_L = 1 + j/3 = (3 + j)/3.

So Z_L = 50 * [ (3 - j)/3 ] / [ (3 + j)/3 ].

The 3 denominators cancel, so we get 50 * (3 - j)/(3 + j).

Multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of denominator to rationalize:

(3 - j)(3 - j) / (3 + j)(3 - j) = [ (9 -6j + j²) ] / (9 +1) ) → denominator is 10.

Wait, wait. Let me compute numerator:

(3 - j)(3 - j) = 3^2 + (-j)(3)*2 + (−j)^2 → 9 -6j + (−1)(j² is −1? Wait, j² is -1. So (−j)^2 is (−1)^2 j² → 1*(-1) = -1.

Wait, let's compute (3 - j)(3 - j):

3*3 =9,

3*(-j) = -3j,

(-j)*3= -3j,

(-j)*(-j)= j² = -1.

Adding up: 9 -3j -3j -1 → 8 -6j.

Denominator is (3 + j)(3 -j )= 9 - (j)^2 = 9 - (-1)=10.

So numerator is 8 -6j, denominator 10.

So Z_L = 50 * (8 -6j)/10 → 5*(8-6j) → 40 -30j ohms.

Now, looking at the options:

Option I says Γ_L is (-j)/3, Z_L=40-30j ohms. So that's our answer.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option A: Γ_L=(-j/3), Z_L=50-30j → No, we got 40-30j.

Option B: Γ=(-j/3), Z=60-30j → No.

Option E: Γ=(-j/3), Z=40-40j → No, ours is 40-30j.

Option I: Γ=(-j/3),
