Okay, so I have this insurance problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question has two parts. First, I need to find the premium on a $60,000 policy when the rate is $0.2065 per $100. Second, I have to determine how much the insurance company would pay if there's a loss of $61,000.

Starting with the first part: calculating the premium. I remember that the rate is per $100 of the policy amount. So the formula I think is (Policy Amount / 100) multiplied by the rate. 

So the policy is $60,000, right? Dividing that by 100 gives me 600. Then I multiply by the rate, which is 0.2065. Let me do the math: 600 times 0.2065. Hmm, I can break that down. 600 times 0.2 is 120, and 600 times 0.0065 is... let's see, 600 times 0.006 is 3.6, and 600 times 0.0005 is 0.3. So adding those together: 3.6 + 0.3 = 3.9. So total is 120 + 3.9 = 123.9. Wait, but looking at the options, I see options with $124, $120, etc. So maybe it's $124 when rounded to the nearest dollar. Or perhaps the rate is applied with more precision.

Wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute 600 * 0.2065. Let's do it step by step. 600 times 0.2 is 120. 600 times 0.00 is 0. 600 times 0.0065 is 3.9. So 120 + 3.9 = 123.9, which is $123.90. So the premium would be approximately $124. Looking at the options, some have $124 as the first number. Like option E is $123, and others like A is $124. Wait, no—option A is $124, but the second part of A is $60,000. Hmm.

But wait, let me make sure. Maybe I should double-check the calculation. 0.2065 multiplied by 600. Let's compute it as 600 * 0.2065 = ?

Alternatively, I can compute 60,000 * 0.2065 / 100. Because per $100, so 60,000 divided by 100 is 600. So yeah, 600 * 0.2065 = 123.9, so $123.90, which rounds to $124. So the premium is $124.

Now the second part: how much would the insurance company pay on a $61,000 loss. I think this depends on the coverage. If the policy is for $60,000, then the company would pay up to that amount, right? So if the loss is $61,000 but the policy is only $60k, the company would pay $60k. Wait, unless there's something about the rate or maybe some deductible. But the question doesn't mention a deductible, so I think it's straightforward.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes policies might have something like actual cash value or replacement cost, but the question doesn't specify any of that. It's just asking about the payment on the loss, so I think it's the lesser of the policy limit or the loss amount. So since the loss is $61k and policy is $60k, the company would pay $60k.

Now looking at the options, let's see which one matches. The first part is $124 and the second is $60k.

Looking at the options:

Option A: $124 and $60k. That's one possibility.

Option E: $123 and $61k. So the first part is $123, but I calculated $124, so E is probably wrong.

Option H: $120 and $61k. No, because the first part is $120, which doesn't match.

Option B: $120 and $60k.

Wait, I need to be careful. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are A through I, each with two amounts. The first is the premium, the second is the payout.

Wait, let me list the options:

A: $124 and $60,000

B: $120 and $60,000

C: $130 and $61,000

D: $118 and $59,000

E: $123 and $61,000

F: $122 and $60,500

G: $125 and $59,000

H: $120 and $61,000

I: $126 and $61,000

So, according to my calculation, the premium is $124, and the payout is $60k. So looking for an option where first is ~124 and second is 60k.

Option A: $124 and $60k. So that matches.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations once more. Maybe I made a mistake in the premium calculation.

Wait 0.2065 per $100. So for each $100, it's $0.2065. So for $60,000, how many $100 units? 600.

600 * 0.2065 = ?

Let me compute 600 * 0.2 = 120.

600 * 0.0065 = 3.9.

So 120 +3.9=123.9, which is 123.90, so $123.90, so when rounded to the nearest dollar, that's $124. So yes, the premium is $124.

So the first part is $124, second is $60k.

Looking at the options, option A is $124 and $60k. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but looking again, is there any possibility that the insurance company would pay the full $61k if the policy is $60k? No, because the policy only covers up to $60k. So the company can't pay more than the policy amount. So the second part is definitely $60k.

So the correct answer should be option A: $124 and $60k.

Wait, but let me check if any other option matches. What about option H? It's $120 and $61k. No, because the first part is $120 which doesn't match, and the second is higher than the policy. So no.

Another point: perhaps the rate is applied differently. Wait, is the rate per $100, so 60,000 is 600 times 100, so 600 * 0.2065 is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the rate is per $100 of the policy, so policy is 60,000, so 60,000 / 100 = 600, 600 * 0.2065 = 123.9, which is 123.90, so $124.

So yes, the first part is $124, the second is $60k.

So the correct option is A.

To determine the premium on a $60,000 policy with a rate of $0.2065 per $100, the formula is:

\[
\text{Premium} = \left(\frac{\text{Policy Amount}}{100}\right) \times \text{Rate}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Premium} = \left(\frac{60,000}{100}\right) \times 0.2065 = 600 \times 0.2065 = 123.9
\]

Rounding to the nearest dollar, the premium is **$124**.

For the second part, the insurance company would pay the lesser of the policy limit or the loss amount. Since the policy limit is $60,000 and the loss is $61,000, the insurance company would pay **$60,000**.

Now, comparing these results with the options provided:

- **Option A**: $124 and $60,000 — This matches the calculated premium and payout.
- Other options either have incorrect premium amounts (e.g., $120, $123, $130) or incorrect payout amounts (e.g., $59,000, $61,000).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**A: $124 and $60,000**

Answer: A
