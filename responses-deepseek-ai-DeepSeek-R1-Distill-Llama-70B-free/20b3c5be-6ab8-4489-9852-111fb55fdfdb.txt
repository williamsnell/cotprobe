Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Anscombe's view on Sidgwick's ethics. The question is asking what Anscombe claims Sidgwick believes about estimating the badness of an action. The options are from A to J.

First, I need to recall what I know about Sidgwick and Anscombe. Sidgwick was a utilitarian, right? He wrote "Methods of Ethics," where he discussed different ethical theories, including egoism, intuitionism, and utilitarianism. His approach was more in line with consequentialism, where the rightness or wrongness of an action depends on its consequences.

Anscombe, on the other hand, was a critic of modern moral philosophy, especially utilitarianism. She wrote an essay called "Modern Moral Philosophy," where she critiques Sidgwick and others. She's known for her concept of "consequentialism" and how she argues against it, emphasizing the importance of intention and moral rules instead.

The question is about how Sidgwick estimates the badness of an action. Since Sidgwick is a utilitarian, I think he would look at the consequences of the action. Utilitarians typically assess actions based on whether they maximize overall happiness or minimize suffering. So the badness would be in terms of the outcomes—like, if an action leads to more harm, it's bad.

Looking at the options, F is "its expected consequences" and G is "its actual consequences." Utilitarianism often focuses on expected consequences because you make decisions based on what you expect to happen. However, sometimes ethical theories consider actual outcomes, but I'm not sure if Sidgwick specifically emphasized expected or actual.

Wait, Sidgwick was a hedonistic utilitarian. He believed that the rightness of an action is determined by whether it promotes the greatest happiness for the greatest number. So he would consider the consequences, but what kind?

I think in utilitarian terms, especially for Sidgwick, it's about the expected consequences because you have to decide based on what you can foresee. Actual consequences might be more relevant in a different context, like evaluating after the fact, but when estimating badness before acting, it's the expected outcomes that matter.

But wait, another thought: Anscombe might be pointing out that Sidgwick's view requires considering the actual consequences because the moral judgment should be based on real outcomes, not just expectations. However, I'm not certain about that. I remember that in Anscombe's critique, she argues that consequentialism neglects the concept of intention, but the question is about what Sidgwick's view is, according to Anscombe.

Wait, the question says "Anscombe claims that on Sidgwick’s view..." So it's about Anscombe's interpretation, not necessarily the correct interpretation. So what did Anscombe say about Sidgwick?

I think Anscombe was critical of Sidgwick's approach because she thought it was overly focused on consequences. She might have argued that Sidgwick's method requires looking at the actual consequences rather than just the intentions or the action itself. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, another angle: Sidgwick's utilitarianism is about the overall happiness, so the badness would be in terms of how much it reduces happiness. So the estimation is based on the consequences, whether expected or actual.

In the context of the question, the options are F and G. If the question is about estimating the badness when the action is being considered, it's about expected consequences. If it's after the action, it's actual. But the question doesn't specify when the estimation happens.

Wait, the question says "the badness of an action must be estimated in light of". So it's about the criteria used to determine badness. For utilitarians, it's about the consequences, so the answer would be F or G.

I think Sidgwick's approach is more about the actual consequences because he was a hedonist and considered the actual pleasure and pain. But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps Anscombe points out that Sidgwick's view requires considering the actual consequences because he's a utilitarian who looks at outcomes, not just intentions. So maybe the answer is G.

But I'm a bit confused because sometimes utilitarians are said to care about expected consequences because that's what guides action. Actual consequences might be more for evaluation after the fact.

Wait, but the question is about estimating the badness of an action, which I think refers to when you're deciding whether it's bad, not after it's done. So in that case, you have to go with expected consequences.

But then again, Sidgwick in his "Methods of Ethics" does discuss the difference between objective and subjective rightness. Objective rightness is based on actual consequences, while subjective is based on expected. So maybe he thinks that the badness is based on the actual consequences, but that's a more objective assessment.

But the question is about Anscombe's claim. She might argue that Sidgwick's view requires looking at the actual consequences, which she criticizes as ignoring intentions.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is F, expected consequences.

I think I need to make a decision. Since Sidgwick is a utilitarian, the badness is about the consequences. The options are F and G. If the estimation is about the potential outcomes when considering the action, it's expected. So F.

But I also recall that Anscombe was critical of the idea that you can predict all consequences, so she might have pointed out that Sidgwick's approach requires considering all possible consequences, which would be the expected ones.

Hmm, maybe the answer is F: its expected consequences.

Anscombe's critique of Sidgwick centers on his utilitarian approach, which assesses the morality of an action based on its consequences. Sidgwick, as a utilitarian, evaluates actions by their potential to maximize happiness or minimize suffering. The question asks how Anscombe claims Sidgwick estimates the badness of an action. 

Utilitarianism generally focuses on consequences, and Sidgwick's hedonistic utilitarianism emphasizes the actual pleasure and pain resulting from an action. However, when deciding the badness of an action, the estimation typically involves the expected consequences, as decisions are made based on foreseeable outcomes rather than actual results, which are only known after the fact. Anscombe likely highlights that Sidgwick's method requires considering the expected consequences of an action to determine its moral value.

Thus, the correct answer is:

F: its expected consequences.

Answer: F
