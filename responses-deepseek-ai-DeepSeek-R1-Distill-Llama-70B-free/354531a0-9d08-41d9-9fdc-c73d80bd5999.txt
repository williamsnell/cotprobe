Okay, so I've got this question about interest rates, both nominal and real. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Mr. Riley loaned his friend Mr. Gillis $400 to buy a second-hand car. A year later, Mr. Gillis pays back $420. During that year, the consumer price index (CPI) rose by 5%. The question has two parts: a) finding the nominal interest rate, and b) finding the real interest rate. Then I have to choose the correct option from A to J.

Alright, let's tackle part a) first. The nominal interest rate is the rate we usually talk about, which is the rate before adjusting for inflation. So, how do I calculate that?

I remember that the formula for simple interest is I = P * R * T, where I is the interest, P is the principal, R is the rate, and T is the time. But wait, in this case, I think I can find the rate by looking at the amount paid back.

The principal (P) is $400. After one year, he gets back $420. So the amount paid over the principal is $20. That's the interest earned. So, I = $20.

So R is the interest rate. Since it's for one year, T=1. Plugging into the formula: 20 = 400 * R *1. So R = 20/400 = 0.05, which is 5%. Wait, but wait, let me double-check. Because sometimes people calculate the rate differently. Oh, wait, but wait, the total amount paid is 420, which is the principal plus interest. So 420 = 400*(1 + R). So 420 =400 + (400*R). So 20=400 R, so R=20/400=0.05, so 5%. So the nominal rate is 5%? Hmm, but let me see the options. Looking at the options, option C says nominal rate 5%, real 0. Option G says nominal 5%, real -1. So that's possible.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I'm remembering correctly. Wait, sometimes the nominal interest rate is calculated using the total amount. Let me think again. The interest is $20 on $400, which is 5%. So that would make the nominal rate 5%. So part a) is 5%, which is option C or G for part a.

Now part b), the real rate of interest. I remember the formula for real rate is approximately nominal rate minus inflation rate. The exact formula is (1 + nominal) = (1 + real) * (1 + inflation), but when inflation and real rates are small, they can approximate real â‰ˆ nominal - inflation.

So inflation here is the CPI increase, which is 5% over the year. So the real rate would be 5% (nominal) minus 5% (inflation) equals 0%. So real rate is 0%.

Looking back at the options, option C says nominal 5%, real 0%. So that would be the correct answer for both a and b. But let me double-check the real rate calculation because sometimes it's better to use the exact formula.

The exact formula is real rate r = ( (1 + nominal) / (1 + inflation) ) - 1.

So plugging in the numbers: nominal is 0.05, inflation is 0.05.

(1 + 0.05)/(1 + 0.05) = 1.05/1.05 =1. So r= 1 -1=0. So yes, the real rate is 0%.

So looking at the options, that's option C: Nominal 5%, Real 0%. So the correct answer is C.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in part a. Because sometimes the nominal rate is calculated as the percentage of the total amount. Wait, no, the principal is $400. The interest is $20, which is 5% of 400. So yes, that's correct. So yes, 5% nominal.

Another way to think: If the inflation rate is 5%, then the purchasing power of the $400 increased by 5% over the year. So in real terms, how much is $420 in terms of last year's dollars?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of real interest. The real interest can also be thought as the increase in purchasing power.

So, the lender, Mr. Riley, gets back $420, but because inflation is 5%, the real value is less. So $420 in nominal terms is equal to 420/(1.05) in real terms. Let's compute that: 420 / 1.05 = 400. So the real amount is $400. Which means the real purchasing power hasn't increased. So the real interest rate is 0%, which matches our earlier calculation.

So yes, the real rate is 0%. So option C is correct.

To determine the nominal and real rates of interest in this scenario:

### Part (a): Nominal Rate of Interest
The nominal rate of interest is calculated based on the principal amount and the total interest paid. Mr. Riley loaned $400, and after one year, he received $420. The interest earned is:

\[
\text{Interest} = \$420 - \$400 = \$20
\]

Using the simple interest formula:

\[
R = \frac{\text{Interest}}{\text{Principal}} = \frac{20}{400} = 0.05 \, \text{or} \, 5\%
\]

Thus, the nominal rate of interest is **5%**.

### Part (b): Real Rate of Interest
The real rate of interest accounts for inflation. The formula to approximate the real rate is:

\[
\text{Real Rate} \approx \text{Nominal Rate} - \text{Inflation Rate}
\]

Given that the inflation rate (CPI increase) is 5%, the real rate is:

\[
\text{Real Rate} = 5\% - 5\% = 0\%
\]

This result can also be verified using the exact formula:

\[
(1 + \text{Nominal Rate}) = (1 + \text{Real Rate}) \cdot (1 + \text{Inflation Rate})
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
1 + 0.05 = (1 + \text{Real Rate}) \cdot (1 + 0.05)
\]

\[
1.05 = (1 + \text{Real Rate}) \cdot 1.05
\]

\[
\text{Real Rate} = 0\%
\]

### Final Answer
The nominal rate of interest is **5%**, and the real rate of interest is **0%**. Comparing these results with the options provided, the correct choice is:

**C: Nominal rate is 5%, Real rate is 0%**
