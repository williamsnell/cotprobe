Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the rate of change of the total cost with respect to time for producing Gaped Ghouls at Star Toys Factory. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on calculus, but let's try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the problem gives me the cost function C(n) which is 0.2n² + n + 900. So that's the cost in dollars depending on the number of ghouls produced, n. And the production rate is given by t² + 100t ghouls produced in t hours. Wait, so if t is time in hours, then the number of ghouls produced, n, is a function of t. So n(t) = t² + 100t. Got it.

Now, the question is asking for the formula for the rate of change of the total cost with respect to time. So that's dC/dt. Right, because we need to find how the cost changes as time increases.

I remember from calculus that to find dC/dt, I should use the chain rule. Because C is a function of n, and n is a function of t. So the chain rule says dC/dt = dC/dn * dn/dt.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, find dC/dn. The cost function is C(n) = 0.2n² + n + 900. Taking the derivative with respect to n, that's straightforward.

dC/dn = derivative of 0.2n² is 0.4n, plus the derivative of n which is 1, and the derivative of 900 is 0. So dC/dn = 0.4n + 1.

Next, find dn/dt. The production function is n(t) = t² + 100t. Taking the derivative with respect to t, the derivative of t² is 2t, and the derivative of 100t is 100. So dn/dt = 2t + 100.

Now, applying the chain rule: dC/dt = (0.4n + 1) * (2t + 100).

But wait, n is a function of t, right? So I can substitute n with t² + 100t. Let me do that substitution.

So substituting n = t² + 100t into dC/dt:

dC/dt = (0.4*(t² + 100t) + 1) * (2t + 100).

Let me expand this expression. First, calculate the 0.4 times (t² + 100t):

0.4t² + 40t. Then add 1, so the first part becomes 0.4t² +40t +1.

Now multiply this by (2t + 100):

(0.4t² +40t +1) * (2t +100).

Let me multiply each term. Let's distribute each term in the first polynomial across the second.

First term: 0.4t² * 2t = 0.8t³.
0.4t² * 100 = 40t².

Second term: 40t * 2t = 80t².
40t * 100 = 4000t.

Third term: 1 * 2t = 2t.
1 * 100 = 100.

Now, add all these terms together:

0.8t³ + 40t² + 80t² + 4000t + 2t + 100.

Combine like terms:

- t³ terms: 0.8t³.
- t² terms: 40t² +80t² = 120t².
- t terms: 4000t +2t = 4002t.
- Constant: 100.

So putting it all together, dC/dt = 0.8t³ +120t² +4002t +100.

Now, let me look at the options provided.

Looking at option J: 0.8t³ +120t² +4002t +100. That's exactly what I got.

Wait, but let me check the other options just to be sure I didn't make a mistake.

Option A is linear in t, that's too simple. Option B is a cubic but the coefficients don't match. Option D is also cubic but the coefficients are lower. Option E is quadratic, so not matching. Hmm.

Option J seems to match exactly. So I think that's the correct answer.

To determine the rate of change of the total cost with respect to time, we start with the given cost function \( C(n) = 0.2n^2 + n + 900 \) and the production function \( n(t) = t^2 + 100t \). The goal is to find \( \frac{dC}{dt} \), which requires applying the chain rule: 

\[
\frac{dC}{dt} = \frac{dC}{dn} \cdot \frac{dn}{dt}.
\]

1. **Compute \( \frac{dC}{dn} \):**  
   The derivative of \( C(n) = 0.2n^2 + n + 900 \) with respect to \( n \) is:  
   \[
   \frac{dC}{dn} = 0.4n + 1.
   \]

2. **Compute \( \frac{dn}{dt} \):**  
   The derivative of \( n(t) = t^2 + 100t \) with respect to \( t \) is:  
   \[
   \frac{dn}{dt} = 2t + 100.
   \]

3. **Apply the chain rule:**  
   Substituting \( \frac{dC}{dn} \) and \( \frac{dn}{dt} \) into the chain rule:  
   \[
   \frac{dC}{dt} = (0.4n + 1)(2t + 100).
   \]

4. **Substitute \( n(t) = t^2 + 100t \):**  
   Replace \( n \) with \( t^2 + 100t \):  
   \[
   \frac{dC}{dt} = (0.4(t^2 + 100t) + 1)(2t + 100).
   \]

5. **Expand the expression:**  
   First, expand \( 0.4(t^2 + 100t) + 1 \):  
   \[
   0.4t^2 + 40t + 1.
   \]  
   Then multiply by \( 2t + 100 \):  
   \[
   (0.4t^2 + 40t + 1)(2t + 100).
   \]  
   Distribute each term:  
   \[
   0.4t^2 \cdot 2t = 0.8t^3, \quad 0.4t^2 \cdot 100 = 40t^2, \quad 40t \cdot 2t = 80t^2, \quad 40t \cdot 100 = 4000t, \quad 1 \cdot 2t = 2t, \quad 1 \cdot 100 = 100.
   \]  
   Combine like terms:  
   \[
   0.8t^3 + (40t^2 + 80t^2) + (4000t + 2t) + 100 = 0.8t^3 + 120t^2 + 4002t + 100.
   \]

6. **Match with the options:**  
   The derived expression \( 0.8t^3 + 120t^2 + 4002t + 100 \) matches **Option J**.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**J**
