Okay, so I've got this problem here about an ideal gas in a container, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read it again. The problem says that there's a 0.100-liter container at a constant temperature with 5.0 × 10^10 molecules of an ideal gas. Then, the volume is changed to 0.005 liters, and I need to find out how many molecules remain. Also, I need to find the volume occupied by 10,000 molecules at the initial conditions.

Hmm, I remember that for ideal gases, the ideal gas law applies, which is PV = nRT. But wait, since the temperature is constant, maybe I can use Avogadro's law, which deals with volume and amount of gas at constant temperature and pressure. Oh right, Avogadro's law states that V1/n1 = V2/n2, where n is the number of moles. But wait, in this problem, the pressure is probably constant too because the temperature is constant and the container is changing volume. Or wait, no, the container is changing volume, but is the pressure constant? Hmm. Wait, the problem says the container's volume is changed, but it's maintained at constant temperature. I think the pressure might change because the volume is changing, but since the number of molecules is changing, perhaps the amount of gas is changing.

Wait, no, the problem says the container's volume is changed to 0.005 liters. But is the gas still the same gas? Or is some gas being let out? Let me read the question again. It says, "how many molecules remain if the volume is changed". Oh, so the number of molecules remains the same? Or does it change? Wait, no, because when you change the volume, if pressure changes, but if the container is sealed, then the number of molecules would stay the same. But the question isn't entirely clear. Wait, looking back: the wording is, "how many molecules remain if the volume is changed." So perhaps the container is flexible, and by changing the volume, the pressure adjusts, but the number of molecules could stay the same. Or maybe the pressure is kept constant by letting some gas escape. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, the problem says the container is maintained at constant temperature. So if the container's volume is changed, but it's a rigid container, that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe it's a piston setup where volume can change. But how does that affect the number of molecules?

Wait, perhaps the container is being compressed or expanded, but the number of molecules remains the same because nothing is added or removed. Oh wait, but the question says the volume is changed to 0.005 l. So maybe the container is being compressed, but the number of molecules remains the same, so the pressure increases. But the first part of the question is, how many molecules remain? So perhaps the number doesn't change, so it's still 5e10 molecules? But that can't be right because the options don't have that. Wait, let me check the options. Looking at the options, like option J has 5e10 molecules, but that's for the second part maybe.

Wait, no, the first part is how many molecules remain. If the volume is changed, but the temperature is the same, and the container is sealed, then the number of molecules doesn't change. So the first answer would be 5e10, but looking at the options, that's not possible because all options for the first part are lower except D, E, J. So that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the pressure is kept constant, and the volume is changed, which would mean that the number of molecules changes. Because if you reduce the volume by a factor, the number of molecules would reduce proportionally if pressure is constant.

Wait, so let's think about it. The situation is that the volume is changing. If temperature is constant, then according to Boyle's Law, P1 V1 = P2 V2, if the amount of gas (n) is constant. But if the amount of gas can change, then perhaps the pressure is kept constant, so that when the volume decreases, the number of molecules decreases proportionally.

Wait, the problem statement is a bit ambiguous. Let me read again: "How many molecules remain if the volume is changed to 0.005 l?" So perhaps the volume is changed, and the pressure adjusts, but the number of molecules stays the same. Or maybe the container is allowed to release molecules to keep pressure the same. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, another approach: the problem is in two parts. The first part asks how many molecules remain after the volume is changed. The second part is about the volume occupied by 10,000 molecules at initial conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the setup is that the gas is allowed to expand or contract, but the number of molecules remains the same. But that would mean that n doesn't change, so using PV = nRT, temperature is constant, so P1 V1 = P2 V2. But then the number of molecules doesn't change, so it's still 5e10, but that's not in the first parts of the options, so probably that's not the case.

Wait the other possibility is that the pressure is kept constant. So if the container is compressed to a smaller volume, and the pressure is kept constant, then the number of molecules would decrease. Because at lower volume and same pressure and temperature, n is lower.

So, if pressure is constant, then n1 V1 = n2 V2. Because, from ideal gas law, at constant P and T, n1 V1 = n2 V2. Because P is same, T is same, so n1 V1 = n2 V2.

Wait, so let's model this. Initial state: V1 = 0.100 L, n1 = 5e10 molecules (but wait, n is in moles, so we need to convert molecules to moles. But wait, perhaps we can think in terms of molecules directly because the ratio would cancel Avogadro's number.

So, if we have n1 = 5e10 molecules, V1 = 0.100 L. Then V2 = 0.005 L. So what is n2?

Assuming pressure is constant, then n1 V1 = n2 V2.

So n2 = n1 (V1 / V2) = 5e10 * (0.100 / 0.005) = 5e10 * 20 = 1e12 molecules? That can't be right because 0.005 is smaller than 0.100, so V is reduced by a factor of 20. So if pressure is constant, then n would increase by the same factor. Wait, no, because if V decreases and P is same, n would increase. But that would mean more molecules, which doesn't make sense if the container is just being compressed. Oh wait, perhaps the container is being compressed, but molecules can't be added. So perhaps in this scenario, the pressure is allowed to increase, and the number of molecules remains the same.

Wait, I think I'm getting tied up here. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let's consider that the process is isothermal (since temperature is constant). So using PV = nRT, with T constant. If the volume changes, but the number of molecules (n) remains the same, then the pressure would change. So the number of molecules stays at 5e10.

But looking at the options, the first part of any option that has 5e10 is D, E, J. The second part of those options is about the volume for 1e4 molecules. But the first part of the question is about how many molecules remain, so perhaps it's 5e10, but the options don't have that except D, E, J.

Wait, but option D says 5e10 molecules, 2e-8 l. Option E: same first part, 2e-6 l for the second. So that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of molecules changes. Maybe the volume is changed, but the pressure is kept constant, so the number of molecules decreases. Let's compute that scenario.

n1 = 5e10 molecules.

V1 = 0.100 L.

V2 = 0.005 L.

Assuming pressure is constant, then n1 V1 = n2 V2.

n2 = n1 * (V1 / V2) = 5e10 * (0.100 / 0.005) = 5e10 * 20 = 1e12 molecules. But this doesn't make sense because when you decrease the volume, if pressure is the same, you would have more molecules. But that's not possible unless you're adding gas, which the problem doesn't suggest. So this scenario seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the pressure isn't constant, but the number of molecules is. Because the container is just changing volume without adding or removing gas. So n stays at 5e10.

Wait, but the first part of the question is, how many molecules remain? So if the container's volume is changed, but it's sealed, then the number of molecules remains the same. So the first answer would be 5e10. But looking at the options, that's only present in D, E, J.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem says "the volume is changed to 0.005 l". So it's an active change in volume. If the container is sealed, the number of molecules remains the same. So the first part would be 5e10 molecules. But none of the options except D, E, J have that, but looking at the options:

Option D: 5e10, 2e-8 l.

Option E:5e10, 2e-6 l.

Option J:5e10,5e-8 l.

Wait, but the second part is, what volume is occupied by 10,000 molecules at initial conditions.

So initial conditions are V=0.100 l, n=5e10 molecules, T is same.

So for 1e4 molecules, what's the volume?

Using Avogadro's law again, since P and T are same, V is proportional to n.

So V2 = V1 * (n2 / n1) = 0.100 L * (1e4 / 5e10) = 0.100 * 2e-7 = 2e-8 liters.

Wait, 1e4 divided by 5e10 is 1e4 /5e10 = 2e-7.

So 0.100 L * 2e-7 = 2e-8 L. So the volume is 2e-8 liters.

Looking at the options, which option has 5e10 molecules in the first part and 2e-8 in the second? Let's check.

Option D: 5e10 molecules, 2e-8 L. Yes, that's D.

Wait, but that would mean that when the volume is changed to 0.005 L, the number of molecules remains 5e10. But in that case, the pressure would have increased. But the problem didn't specify any change in pressure, so that's possible.

But wait, the first part of the question is, how many molecules remain when the volume is changed. If the volume is changed but the container is sealed, the number doesn't change. So the first part would be 5e10, and the second part 2e-8, which is option D.

So looking at the options, the correct choice would be D.

To solve the problem, we analyze the two parts of the question:

### Part 1: How many molecules remain if the volume is changed to 0.005 L?
The problem states that the container is maintained at constant temperature, and the volume is changed to 0.005 L. Since the container is not specified to be open or closed, we assume it is sealed, meaning the number of molecules remains constant at **5.0 × 10¹⁰ molecules**. This is consistent with the ideal gas law, where the number of molecules does not change if the container is sealed, even though the volume changes.

### Part 2: What volume is occupied by 10,000 molecules at the initial temperature and pressure?
At the initial conditions, the volume is 0.100 L, and the number of molecules is 5.0 × 10¹⁰. Using Avogadro's law, which states that volume is proportional to the number of molecules at constant temperature and pressure, we calculate the volume occupied by 10,000 molecules:

\[
V_2 = V_1 \cdot \frac{n_2}{n_1}
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
V_2 = 0.100 \, \text{L} \cdot \frac{10,000}{5.0 \times 10^{10}} = 0.100 \cdot 2 \times 10^{-7} = 2 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{L}
\]

Thus, the volume occupied by 10,000 molecules is **2 × 10⁻⁸ L**.

### Final Answer
The first part of the question gives **5.0 × 10¹⁰ molecules**, and the second part gives **2 × 10⁻⁸ L**. Comparing this to the options, the correct choice is:

**D: 5.0 × 10¹⁰ molecules, 2 × 10⁻⁸ L**

**Answer: D**
