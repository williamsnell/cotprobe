Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

If antibodies can be brought into contact with a virus before it attaches itself to the host cell, the virus will be inactivated. Once infection has occurred, the production of interferon may protect the host from extensive tissue destruction. Explain.

Options:

A: Interferon kills the virus directly
B: Interferon enhances the attachment of viruses to host cells, facilitating the infection process.
C: Interferon is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that is administered to patients to cure viral infections.
D: Interferon strengthens the virus, making it more difficult for the immune system to eliminate it.
E: Interferon is a type of virus that fights other viruses
F: Interferon is a protein produced by virus-infected cells, which spreads to uninfected cells and makes them more resistant to viral infection. This prevents synthesis of viral proteins which are essential for viral production.
G: Antibodies produce interferon in response to a viral infection, which then inactivates the virus.
H: Interferon is a chemical signal that increases the permeability of cells, allowing antibodies to enter and attack the virus.
I: Interferon triggers the immediate destruction of the host cell to prevent the spread of the virus.
J: Interferon is produced by the virus to weaken the host cell

Okay, so I've got this question about antibodies and interferon. Hmm, I remember that antibodies are part of the immune system. They can bind to viruses and inactivate them before they attach to host cells. That makes sense because antibodies are like the first line of defense, right?

The question says that once a virus infects a cell, interferon comes into play to protect the host. Wait, what's interferon exactly? I think it's some kind of signaling protein. Oh right, when a virus infects a cell, the cell produces interferon. This interferon then sends signals to nearby cells.

So the options are A to J. Let me go through them.

Option A: Interferon kills the virus directly. No, I don't think so. I remember that interferon doesn't attack the virus itself. Instead, it helps the cells become resistant.

Option B: Enhances attachment of viruses. That sounds wrong. Interferon is supposed to help prevent infection, not make it easier.

Option C: Broad-spectrum antiviral drug administered to patients. No, interferon isn't a drug we take. It's produced by the body's cells.

Option D: Strengthens the virus. No way. That would be counterproductive.

Option E: It's a type of virus that fights others. No, interferon is a protein, not a virus.

Option F: Protein produced by infected cells, spreads to uninfected, makes them resistant. Oh yeah, this rings a bell. Infected cells release interferon, which then tells other cells to produce antiviral proteins, preventing the virus from replicating. So F sounds correct.

Option G: Antibodies produce interferon. I don't think so. I think it's the infected cells that produce interferon, not the antibodies.

Option H: Chemical signal to let antibodies in. I'm not sure. I thought interferon doesn't directly involve antibodies once the virus is inside. It's more about blocking viral replication.

Option I: Triggers destruction of host cells. Oh wait, that's more like what cytotoxic T cells do, not interferon. Interferon is more about making cells resistant.

Option J: Produced by the virus. No, the host cells produce interferon in response to the virus.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be F.

The correct answer is F. Interferon is a protein produced by virus-infected cells that spreads to uninfected cells, making them more resistant to viral infection by preventing the synthesis of viral proteins essential for replication.

Answer: F
