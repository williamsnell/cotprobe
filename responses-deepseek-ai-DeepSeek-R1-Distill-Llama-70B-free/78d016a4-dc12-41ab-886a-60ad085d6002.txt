Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. The question is about calculating the heat capacity at constant pressure (Cp) for each substance involved in a given reaction. The reaction is C(s) + 2H2O(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2(g) at 25°C. 

Hmm, I remember that heat capacity at constant pressure is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one mole of a substance by one Kelvin, under constant pressure. For gases, I think the Cp values are higher because they have more degrees of freedom compared to solids or liquids. Solids have lower Cp because their atoms can't move as freely.

Wait, each substance's Cp depends on its physical state and molecular structure. For solids, Cp is typically around 6 cal/(K·mol) for simple solids like carbon. Oh wait, I think for carbon, the Cp is about 6 cal/(K·mol). So looking at the options, let me see which one has C(s) as 6. Looking through the options, option B has C(s):6, option E:7.2, A:6.5, etc. So maybe option B is a candidate.

Next, H2O(g). I remember that water vapor has a higher Cp than other gases because of its higher molar mass and more vibrational modes. Wait, the problem says that for H2O(g), the contribution from vibrational modes is 20%. So maybe the Cp is calculated as translational, rotational, and vibrational contributions. 

Translational and rotational modes contribute to Cp. For a gas, translational is 3/2 R, rotational is also some R depending on the molecule. Wait, for diatomic gases, I think translational is 3/2 R, rotational is 2/2 R (linear), so total for diatomic would be (5/2 R) per mole. But H2O is a polyatomic gas, a nonlinear molecule. So for nonlinear, rotational is 3/2 R, so total would be 3 (translational) + 3 (rotational) = 6/2 R = 3R. But that's without vibrational modes.

Wait, wait. Let me think. For monoatomic gases, Cp is (5/2 R), and for diatomic, Cp is (7/2 R) at high temps where vibrational modes are active. But in this case, the problem states that vibrational modes contribute 20% to Cp for H2O(g). So maybe the Cp without vibrational is (translational + rotational), and then 20% is added as vibrational.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me approach it step by step. At room temperature, for H2O(g), the Cp is around 8 cal/(K·mol), but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, the molar heat capacity can be calculated based on degrees of freedom.

For H2O(g), which is a nonlinear triatomic molecule. So normally, the translational modes contribute 3/2 R, rotational contributes 3/2 R (because nonlinear). So 3+3/2 = 3R? Wait, no, R is in terms of per mole. Wait, R is about 1.987 cal/(K·mol), right?

Wait, let me calculate the translational and rotational contributions. Translational: 3/2 R. Rotational for nonlinear: 3/2 R. So total without vibrational: (3/2 + 3/2) R = 3 R. 3 * 1.987 ≈ 5.96 cal/(K·mol). But the options have H2O(g) Cp values higher than that. Oh wait, but vibrational modes add to that. The problem says that vibrational contributes 20% of the total Cp.

So the total Cp of H2O(g) is such that vibrational modes account for 20%. So the translational plus rotational is 80% of Cp.

Let me set up the equation. Let Cp be the total. Then 0.8 * Cp = 3 R.

So Cp = (3 R) / 0.8 = (3 * 1.987) / 0.8 ≈ (5.96) / 0.8 ≈ 7.45 cal/(K·mol). But wait, let me double-check: 3 R is 5.96, so 5.96 / 0.8 is 7.45. Hmm, looking at the options, which one has H2O(g) around 7.45? Let me check the options.

Option B: H2O(g) is 9.1, which is higher. Option A: 8.7, also higher. Option E:6.9. Option G: 8.3. Hmm, none of them are around 7.45. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait another approach: Some sources say that Cp for H2O(g) is about 8.1 cal/(K·mol) at 25°C. So perhaps my approach is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the vibrational contribution isn't 20% of Cp but an additional 20% beyond the translational and rotational.

Wait, the question says: "assume the contribution to Cp from the vibrational mode is 20%." So that would mean vibrational contributes 20% of the total Cp. So the rest (80%) is from translational and rotational.

So, Cp = (trans + rot) + (vibrational). vibrational = 0.2 Cp, so trans + rot = 0.8 Cp.

Wait, but how much is trans + rot for H2O(g)? For a nonlinear molecule, it's (3/2 R translational) + (3/2 R rotational) = 3 R.

3 R is about 5.96 cal/(K·mol). So 5.96 = 0.8 * Cp => Cp ≈ 7.45. But the options don't have that. So perhaps my assumption is wrong. Or perhaps the vibrational contribution is 20% in addition to the usual (trans + rot), not 20% of the total. Hmm, that would be a different approach.

If vibrational adds 20% more to the trans + rot value, then Cp = (trans + rot) * 1.2. So trans + rot is 5.96, so Cp would be 5.96 * 1.2 = 7.15. Still, none of the options are exactly that, but perhaps the question uses a different method.

Alternatively, perhaps each vibrational mode contributes a certain amount. Wait, the vibrational contribution is given as 20% of the Cp. So maybe the total Cp is the sum of translational, rotational, and vibrational, with vibrational being 20% of Cp.

Wait, another approach is to use standard Cp values. I remember that for gases, Cp is typically higher than for solids. For example, solid carbon has a Cp around 6 cal/(K·mol), which is what I thought earlier.

So let me list what I remember about Cp values:

- Carbon (solid): around 6 cal/(K·mol)
- CO2(g): I think it's around 8.3 or so, but I'm not sure.
- H2O(g): about 8.1 cal/(K·mol)
- H2(g): I think it's around 6.9 or 7 cal/(K·mol), but wait, H2 is diatomic. Diatomic gases at room temp have Cp around (5/2 R + R) ? Wait, no. Wait, diatomic has translational (3/2 R), rotational (2/2 R for linear), so total 5/2 R for trans and rot. Then, at room temp, vibrational may not contribute much, so Cp might be around (5/2 R) = (5/2)*1.987 ≈ 4.96 cal/(K·mol). But wait, I thought H2(g) has a higher Cp. Or am I confusing with other gases?

Wait, perhaps H2 is lighter and has a higher Cp. Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up Cv and Cp. For diatomic gases, Cv is (5/2 R), so Cp is (7/2 R) which is about 6.93 cal/(K·mol) since R is approximately 2.

Wait, R is 1.987 cal/(K·mol), so (7/2)*1.987 ≈ (3.5)*1.987 ≈ 6.95 cal/(K·mol). So H2(g) would have a Cp of approximately 6.95. Looking at the options, which one has H2 around 7?

Looking at the options:

Option B: H2 is 7.3

Option E:7.0

Option H:6.3

Option G:6.9

Option A:5.4

Option J:6.5

So perhaps the correct H2 is around 6.9 to 7.0.

Wait, but earlier I thought H2O(g) is around 8.1. So let me check the options again. For H2O(g):

Option B:9.1

Option A:8.7

Option H:8.1

Option G:8.3

Option E:6.9

Option J:9.4

Wait, I think H2O(g) is around 8.1. So looking for an option where H2O(g) is 8.1. Option H has H2O(g) as 8.1. Let me check option H.

Option H: C(s):7, H2O(g):8.1, CO2(g):8.5, H2(g):6.3.

Wait, but I thought CO2(g) has a higher Cp than H2O. Wait, no. CO2 is a triatomic gas, so it has more vibrational modes, leading to a higher Cp. Let me think. CO2 is a linear molecule, so its rotational modes are 2/2 R, but it's triatomic, so more atoms mean more vibrational modes.

Wait, the Cp for CO2(g) is around 8.5 cal/(K·mol). So looking at the options, option B's CO2 is 8.5. Option H's CO2 is 8.5 as well. So if H2O(g) is 8.1, then option H could be a candidate.

Wait, but let me go back. The question is about selecting the correct Cp for each substance.

Let me list what I think each Cp should be:

- C(s): around 6 cal/(K·mol)
- H2O(g): around 8.1
- CO2(g): around 8.5
- H2(g): around 6.95, say 7.0.

Looking at the options, which one matches this?

Looking at option H: C(s)=7, H2O=8.1, CO2=8.5, H2=6.3. Hmm, H2 is 6.3, which is lower than expected. Maybe I'm wrong about H2.

Alternatively, option B: C(s)=6, H2O=9.1, CO2=8.5, H2=7.3. So C(s) is correct, H2O is higher than I expected, but maybe that's because of the vibrational contribution.

Wait, but in the question, H2O's vibrational contributes 20% to Cp. So let me calculate that again. If vibrational is 20% of Cp, then trans + rot contribute 80%.

For H2O(g), trans + rot is 3 R (as I thought earlier). 3 R is about 5.96. So 5.96 = 0.8 * Cp => Cp = 5.96 / 0.8 = 7.45. But none of the options have 7.45. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the vibrational contribution is 20% of the total, and the rest is translational and rotational.

Wait, but if that's the case, and 3 R is 5.96, which is 80% of Cp, then Cp would be 5.96 / 0.8 ≈7.45. But I thought H2O's Cp is around 8.1. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the standard Cp of H2O(g) is about 8.1 cal/(K·mol), which includes vibrational. So if the vibrational is 20% of that, then 8.1 * 0.2 =1.62, so trans + rot would be 6.48. But 3 R is 5.96, so that doesn't add up. Because 5.96 is less than 6.48.

Wait, maybe the problem isn't using standard Cp values but wants us to compute based on vibrational contribution. So perhaps I should compute each Cp.

For C(s): It's a solid, so Cp is around 6 cal/(K·mol). So any option with C(s) as 6 is possible.

For H2O(g): Translational (3/2 R) + rotational (3/2 R) = 3 R. Then, vibrational contributes 20% of Cp. So vibrational is 0.2 Cp. So total Cp = 3 R + 0.2 Cp.

Wait, that would make Cp = (3 R) / (1 - 0.2) )= (3 R) / 0.8 = 3 * 1.987 / 0.8 ≈ 7.45 cal/(K·mol). So H2O(g) Cp is 7.45. But looking at the options, the closest higher is 8.1 in option H, but that's higher than 7.45.

Hmm, this is confusing. Alternatively, maybe the vibrational contribution is an additional 20% beyond the translational and rotational. So Cp = (3 R) + 0.2*(3 R) = 3 R * 1.2 = 7.16. But that's still lower than the options.

Wait, perhaps in the question, the vibrational contributes 20% to the Cp, not in addition but as part of it. So 20% of the Cp is from vibrational, which implies that the rest 80% is from trans and rot.

So 0.8 Cp = 3 R → Cp=3 R /0.8= (3 *1.987)/0.8 ≈ 7.45. So H2O(g) Cp should be about 7.45. Looking through the options, none have exactly that. The closest higher is option A with 8.7, but that's way higher. Option E has 6.9. Hmm, maybe the approach is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the vibrational contribution is treated as adding to the Cp beyond the translational and rotational. So Cp = (trans + rot) + vibrational. If vibrational is 20% of (trans + rot), then vibrational is 0.2 * (trans + rot). So Cp = (trans + rot) * 1.2.

Trans + rot for H2O(g) is 3 R=5.96. So 5.96 *1.2=7.15. So Cp=7.15. Still, no option matches. So perhaps the question is using a different method, or perhaps I should rely on standard Cp values.

Let me think of standard Cp values at 25°C:

- C(s, graphite): 6.0 cal/(K·mol)
- H2O(g): about 8.1 cal/(K·mol)
- CO2(g): around 8.5 cal/(K·mol)
- H2(g): around 6.9 cal/(K·mol)

So looking for an option where:

C(s)=6, H2O=8.1, CO2=8.5, H2=6.9.

Looking through the options:

Option B: C=6, H2O=9.1, CO2=8.5, H2=7.3 → H2O is higher than expected.

Option H: C=7, H2O=8.1, CO2=8.5, H2=6.3 → C is 7, which doesn't match. H2 is 6.3, which is lower than expected.

Option J: C=5.5, H2O=9.4, CO2=8.0, H2=6.5 → C is lower, CO2 lower than expected.

Option G: C=7, H2O=8.3, CO2=7.7, H2=6.9 → CO2 is lower than expected.

Option E: C=7.2, H2O=6.9, CO2=8.3, H2=7.0 → H2O is too low.

Option A: C=6.5, H2O=8.7, CO2=7.9, H2=5.4 → H2 is too low.

Wait, none of the options exactly match the standard values I remember. But perhaps the closest is option B, except H2O is 9.1, which is higher than the standard 8.1. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misremembering the standard values.

Wait, let me double-check standard Cp values. 

Quick search in my memory: 

- Carbon (solid) has Cp around 6 cal/(K·mol).
- H2O(g) is about 8.1 cal/(K·mol).
- CO2(g) is about 8.5 cal/(K·mol).
- H2(g) is about 6.9 or 7.0 cal/(K·mol).

Looking again, the only option that has CO2=8.5 is option B and H. Option B has H2O=9.1, which is higher. Option H has H2O=8.1, which matches, but C(s)=7, which is higher than 6. So if the correct C(s) is 6, then none of the options have all correct. But perhaps the given options have approximations.

Wait, the question might be using a different approach, perhaps with more precise R values or different assumptions. Let's think again.

CO2 is a linear triatomic molecule. So translational (3/2 R), rotational (2/2 R), and vibrational modes. At room temperature, vibrational modes may not be fully active, but the question doesn't specify. However, the problem only specifies that for H2O(g), vibrational contributes 20% of Cp. So for CO2(g), perhaps vibrational isn't considered, or is it?

Wait, no, the question only mentions H2O(g) has vibrational contributing 20%. So for CO2(g), we can assume the standard
