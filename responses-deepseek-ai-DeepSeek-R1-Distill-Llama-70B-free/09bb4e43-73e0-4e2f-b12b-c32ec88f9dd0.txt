Okay, so I have this math problem here about group theory, which I'm trying to wrap my head around. The question is asking about the order of group Z_18. Hmm, I remember from my studies that Z_n usually denotes the cyclic group of integers modulo n. So Z_18 should be the group of integers modulo 18 under addition.

Wait, but wait. Oh right, the order of a group is the number of elements it has. So for a cyclic group Z_n, the order is n because there are n distinct elements, right? Like, each element is a different equivalence class modulo 18.

So Z_18 would have elements {0, 1, 2, ..., 17}, that's 18 elements in total. So the order should be 18. Let me double-check the options.

Looking at the options, option G is 18. So I think that's the correct answer. But wait, I should make sure I'm not mixing this up with something else. Like, sometimes in group theory, especially with more complex structures, the order can be tricky. But no, in the case of cyclic groups like Z_n, it's straightforward. The order is just n.

I don't think there's any catch here. Unless the question is trying to trick me with something else, but I don't see it. So yeah, the order is 18, so G is the answer.

The order of a group Z_n is equal to the number of elements in the group, which is n. For Z_18, this means the group has 18 elements, corresponding to the integers from 0 to 17 under addition modulo 18. Therefore, the order of Z_18 is 18.

Answer: G
