Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the standard enthalpy of formation for NO(g) at 975 K. I'm a bit rusty on thermodynamics, but let's see if I can work through it.

From what I remember, the standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. At 298 K, we have known values for this. But here, the temperature is higher, 975 K, so I guess I need to adjust for the temperature change.

I think the formula involves the heat capacities. Oh right, when the temperature changes, the enthalpy changes too, and you can calculate that using the heat capacity at constant pressure (Cp), assuming it's constant over the temperature range. So the formula should be something like:

ΔHf°(T) = ΔHf°(298 K) + ∫(T2 - T1) * Cp dT 

But since Cp is constant, the integral simplifies to Cp*(T2 - T1). Wait, but I have to consider the Cp for the reaction, which is the Cp of the products minus reactants.

Wait, the reaction for the formation of NO is: ½ N₂(g) + ½ O₂(g) → NO(g). Right. So the ΔCp for the reaction would be Cp(NO) - [½ Cp(N₂) + ½ Cp(O₂)].

I'll need the Cp values for each substance. From standard tables, I think:

- Cp(N₂) is about 29.1 J/mol·K
- Cp(O₂) is about 29.4 J/mol·K
- Cp(NO) is around 30.0 J/mol·K

Let me double-check those values. Yeah, I think that's right. So plugging into the equation:

ΔCp = 30.0 - [ (½ * 29.1) + (½ * 29.4) ]

Calculating each half: ½ of 29.1 is 14.55, and ½ of 29.4 is 14.7. Adding them gives 14.55 +14.7 = 29.25. So ΔCp = 30.0 - 29.25 = 0.75 J/mol·K.

Now, the temperature change is from 298 K to 975 K. So ΔT = 975 - 298 = 677 K.

The change in enthalpy due to temperature is ΔCp * ΔT. So 0.75 J/mol·K * 677 K = 507.75 J/mol, which is 0.50775 kJ/mol. Hmm, that's a small value. But wait, does this get added to the standard enthalpy of formation at 298 K?

Wait, the standard enthalpy of formation of NO at 298 K is known. What's that value again? I think it's about 90.4 kJ/mol. Let me make sure—yeah, I remember that NO has a positive ΔHf° because it's endothermic to form from N₂ and O₂, so around 90.4 kJ/mol.

So the formula would be ΔHf°(975) = ΔHf°(298) + (ΔCp * ΔT). But wait, does the sign matter? Because the ΔCp is positive here, so the enthalpy increases with temperature.

Plugging in the numbers: 90.4 kJ/mol + 0.50775 kJ/mol ≈ 90.90775 kJ/mol. Wait, but looking at the options, the closest would be around 91 kJ/mol, but let me look at the options.

The options are A to J, with E being 91.7, H is 99.9, and so on. Hmm, my initial calculation gives approximately 90.9, which isn't exactly an option. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the Cp values. Let me make sure I have the right ones. 

Another source says Cp for N₂ is 29.1 J/mol·K, O₂ is 29.37 J/mol·K, and NO is 30.4 J/mol·K. Oh wait, maybe I got the NO value wrong earlier. Let me recalculate with Cp(NO)=30.4.

So ΔCp would be 30.4 - [ (29.1/2) + (29.37/2) ]

Calculating each term: 29.1/2 is 14.55, 29.37/2 is about 14.685. Sum is 14.55 + 14.685 = 29.235. So ΔCp = 30.4 -29.235 = 1.165 J/mol·K.

Now ΔT is 677 K, so 1.165 *677 = let's calculate that. 1 *677 is 677, 0.165*677 ≈ 111.705. So total is 677 +111.705 = 788.705 J/mol, which is 0.7887 kJ/mol.

So now, ΔHf°(975) = 90.4 + 0.7887 ≈ 91.1887 kJ/mol. So approximately 91.19 kJ/mol. Looking at the options, option E is 91.7, which is close but not exact. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I missed something else. Did I forget to account for the moles? Let me think. The reaction is ½ N2 + ½ O2 → NO. So the Cp calculations are correct as I did before. Or perhaps the initial ΔHf° value is different.

Wait, another thought: sometimes the standard enthalpy of formation for NO is given as 90.37 kJ/mol at 298 K. Let me use that.

So 90.37 + 0.7887 = 91.1587, so about 91.16 kJ/mol. The closest option is E, which is 91.7. But it's off by about half a kJ. Hmm, perhaps my Cp values are still off. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is considered as 1 mole, but the calculation is done correctly.

Wait, another possibility: maybe I should use Cp in a different way. Let me re-express the formula. The correct approach is ΔHf° at T = ΔHf° at 298 + ∫(T2-T1)(ΔCp) dT.

Wait, but another detail: the standard enthalpy of formation is for the formation of one mole of NO. So the calculation should be correct as done.

Alternatively, perhaps the given Cp values are different. Let me think if Cp(NO) is 30.4, and the others are 29.1 and 29.4 as before.

Wait, let me see what the correct Cp values are. From standard tables:

Cp for N2(g) at 298 K is 29.12 J/mol·K.

Cp for O2(g) is 29.37 J/mol·K.

Cp for NO(g) is 30.47 J/mol·K.

So using these more precise numbers:

ΔCp = 30.47 - (29.12/2 + 29.37/2) 

Calculating the halves:

29.12 /2 =14.56; 29.37/2=14.685. Sum is 14.56+14.685=29.245.

So ΔCp =30.47 -29.245 = 1.225 J/mol·K.

Then, ΔT is 975-298=677 K.

So ΔH = 1.225 J/mol·K *677 K = 829.425 J/mol → 0.8294 kJ/mol.

Adding this to ΔHf°(298) of 90.37 kJ/mol gives 91.20 kJ/mol.

Hmm, that's 91.20, which is very close to option E, 91.7. But it's a bit lower. Wait, perhaps the ΔHf°(298) is taken as 90.4, leading to 91.2294, which would be 91.23. So the options don't have exactly that, but E is 91.7.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ΔCp. Let me recalculate:

ΔCp = Cp(NO) - [ (Cp(N2) + Cp(O2))/2 ]

Wait, no, because the reaction is ½ N2 + ½ O2 → NO. So for each ½ mole, you take half of their Cp, and sum.

So:

ΔCp = Cp(NO) ×1 - [ (Cp(N2) × ½) + (Cp(O2) × ½) ]

Which is same as before.

So with Cp(NO)=30.47, Cp(N2)=29.12, Cp(O2)=29.37.

ΔCp = 30.47 - ( (29.12 +29.37)/2 )

Calculate numerator: 29.12 +29.37=58.49. Half is 29.245.

So 30.47 - 29.245 = 1.225 J/mol·K.

Yes, same as before.

So the change is 1.225 *677 = 829.425 J → 0.8294 kJ.

So 90.37 + 0.8294 = 91.1994 ≈ 91.20 kJ/mol.

Looking at the options, the closest is E:91.7, but it's 0.5 higher. So not matching exactly. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the ΔHf° at 298 is given as 90.4 kJ/mol, which would give 91.2294, but still not 91.7.

Wait another thought: maybe the ΔHf° of NO is given as 90.37, but perhaps I should use a more precise Cp for NO. Let me check again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that the Cp values are in J/(mol·K), and perhaps I missed a decimal point. Wait, no, because 1.225 J/K·mol *677 K is 829 J, which is 0.829 kJ.

Wait, maybe the initial Cp values are different. Alternatively, perhaps the approach is not just a simple ΔT multiplication but uses Kirchhoff's law more accurately. Or maybe the question considers the reaction in a different way.

Wait, Kirchhoff's law says that ΔH at T is ΔH at 298 plus the integral of ΔCp dT from 298 to T.

Yes, that's what I did.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the Cp of the reaction, but I might have miscalculated the ΔCp.

Wait, let me recompute using the exact numbers.

Another approach: compute the Cp for each substance, sum for reactants and subtract from product.

Reaction: ½ N2 + ½ O2 → NO.

Reactants Cp: (½ *29.12) + (½ *29.37) = 14.56 +14.685 =29.245 J/(mol·K).

Product Cp: 30.47 J/(mol·K).

So ΔCp = 30.47 -29.245 =1.225 J/(mol·K).

Yes, same as before.

So the calculation seems correct. So the change would be 1.225 *677= 829.425 J, which is 0.829 kJ.

So the total is about 91.199 kJ/mol.

Looking again at the options, E is 91.7, which is 0.5 kJ higher. Maybe due to rounding in intermediate steps or different Cp values.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses ΔHf° of NO as 90.4 kJ/mol, leading to 90.4 +0.829≈91.23, which is about 91.2. The closest option is E:91.7, but it's not exact. So maybe I made a mistake in the Cp values.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem uses the Cp of NO as 29.8 J/mol·K. Let's try that. So then ΔCp would be 29.8 - ((29.12+29.37)/2) → 29.8 -29.245 =0.555 J/mol·K.

Then ΔH =0.555 *677 = 376 J → 0.376 kJ.

So ΔHf becomes 90.4 +0.376=90.776, about 90.8, which is close to option B:80.9, no. Hmm, that's lower.

Wait, that's the opposite of what I need. So that doesn't help.

Alternatively, maybe I should use a different ΔHf° value. Let me check another source. Oh wait, perhaps the standard ΔHf° of NO is 90.4 kJ/mol, yes. So that part is correct.

I'm a bit stuck because my calculation leads to around 91.2 kJ/mol, but the options don't have exactly that. The closest option is E:91.7, but it's higher. Maybe I should check whether the calculation is correct again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I forgot that the reaction is per mole of NO, and maybe the Cp of the reaction is multiplied by the temperature difference. Or perhaps the Cp values were in kJ instead of J. Wait, no, because I converted J to kJ.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the Cp in kJ. Let me see: 1.225 J/(mol·K) is 0.001225 kJ/(mol·K).

So 0.001225 *677= 0.829 kJ/mol.

Yes, same as before.

So I'm confident that my calculation is correct, but the options don't match exactly. Perhaps the intended answer is E, 91.7, assuming some rounding differences or perhaps different Cp values were used in the problem setup.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial ΔHf° value. If it's 90.37, then adding 0.829 gives 91.199, which is approximately 91.2. But that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the ΔHf° at 298 is 90.4 kJ/mol, which would give 91.229, which is approximately 91.2. The options don't have this, but perhaps the intended answer is E:91.7. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should check the units again. The question says to calculate ΔHf° for NO(g) at 975 K. Oh wait, perhaps I should have used the Cp in a different way. Let me think: the formula is ΔH(T) = ΔH(298) + ΔCp*(T -298), but perhaps I should have considered that the Cp is for the reaction, so it's multiplied by the temperature change.

Yes, which is exactly what I did. So I think my approach is correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem uses the Cp values at a different temperature. But the problem states that the heat capacities are constant over the interval and taken at 298 K. So that shouldn't be an issue.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the ΔHf° of NO at 298 as 90.4 kJ/mol, and the calculation gives 91.23, so maybe the intended answer is E:91.7, which is the closest. Or perhaps I missed something else.

Wait, maybe the formula is ΔHf°(T) = ΔHf°(298) + (Cp(T) - Cp(298)) * (T -298). But no, because Cp is assumed constant, so that's not necessary.

I'm a bit stuck, but I think the correct approach leads to approximately 91.2 kJ/mol, but since that's not an option, I might have to pick the closest one. Looking at the options, E is 91.7, which is 0.5 higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Wait, ΔCp is positive, so the change adds to the enthalpy. So the calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to consider the enthalpy change from 298 to 975, but perhaps I should have used ΔH = n*Cp*ΔT. But in this case, n is 1 mole of NO. So yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the equation in a different way. Let me think of another approach. The standard enthalpy of formation at T is the enthalpy change when reactants (N2 and O2) at 298 K are heated to T, then react to form NO at T. So the process is:

1. Heat ½ mole N2 from 298 to 975: q1 = ½ * Cp(N2) * ΔT.

2. Heat ½ mole O2 from 298 to 975: q2 = ½ * Cp(O2) * ΔT.

3. Heat the resulting NO from 975 to 975? No, because it's formed at 975. Wait, perhaps I should think of the reaction occurring at 975 K, so the enthalpy is adjusted for the temperature.

But that might complicate things. Alternatively, the approach is correct as I did before.

Hmm. I think the intended answer is E:91.7, but my calculation gives 91.2. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem uses a slightly different ΔHf° value or Cp values.

Wait, perhaps the Cp(NO) is 30.4, as I thought earlier, leading to ΔCp=1.165, which gives 1.165 *677= 788 J →0.788 kJ. Adding to 90.4 gives 91.188 kJ, which is 91.19. Still, E is 91.7.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses ΔHf° of 90.37 and Cp(NO) of 30.47, leading to 91.20, but again, no option matches.

Wait, let me check the options again. The options are:

A:76.4

B:80.9

C:85.5

D:97.3

E:91.7

F:120.8

G:110.3

H:99.9

I:103.6

J:105.2

So E is 91.7, which is the closest to my calculated 91.2. Maybe the intended answer is E, considering that my calculation is 91.2, and perhaps the problem uses slightly different Cp values, leading to 91.7.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Cp of NO. If Cp(NO) is higher, say 31 J/mol·K, then ΔCp would be 31 -29.245=1.755 J/mol·K. Then 1.755 *677= 1187 J
