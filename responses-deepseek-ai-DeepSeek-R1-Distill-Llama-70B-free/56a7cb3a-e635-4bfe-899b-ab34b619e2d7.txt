Okay, so I have this problem to solve about finding the wavelength of a photon that causes an electron to jump from the valence to the conduction band in germanium at a temperature of 300 K. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solid-state physics, but let me think this through.

I remember that the energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by the equation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. So, I need to find the energy gap first because the photon's energy has to be at least equal to the band gap of germanium for the electron to make that jump.

Wait, what's the band gap energy for germanium? I think it's around 0.67 electron volts, but I'm not totally sure. Let me confirm. Oh right, germanium has a band gap of approximately 0.67 eV at room temperature. Since the problem states the temperature is 300 K, which is about room temp, that should be correct.

Now, I need to convert this energy from electron volts to joules because the Planck constant and speed of light are in standard units. I recall that 1 eV is 1.602 x 10^-19 joules. So, 0.67 eV multiplied by 1.602e-19 J/eV gives me the energy in joules.

Let me calculate that: 0.67 * 1.602e-19 = approximately 1.074e-19 J. Wait, let me double-check that multiplication. 0.67 * 1.6 is 1.072, so yeah, that's right.

Now, using E = hc/λ, I can solve for λ. Rearranging the formula, λ = hc/E.

Plugging in the numbers: h is 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, c is 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. So, hc would be 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = let's compute that. 6.626 * 3 is about 19.878, and then 10^-34 + 10^8 = 10^-26, so 19.878e-26 J·m.

Then, divide that by the energy E, which is 1.074e-19 J. So, 19.878e-26 / 1.074e-19 = let me compute that.

Dividing the numbers: 19.878 / 1.074 is approximately 18.45. Then, the exponents: 10^-26 divided by 10^-19 is 10^-7. So, 18.45e-7 meters. Wait, 1e-9 meters is a nanometer, so 18.45e-7 m is 1845 nm? Hmm, wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, 18.45e-7 m is the same as 1.845e-6 m, but wait, 1e-9 m is 1 nm. So, 1.845e-6 m is 1.845e3 nm, which is 1845 nm. Oh wait, but I think I made a mistake in the exponent.

Wait, 19.878e-26 / 1.074e-19 = (19.878 / 1.074) * 10^(-26 +19) = 18.45 * 10^-7 = 1.845e-6 meters, which is 1845 nm. But wait, looking at the options, none of them are exactly 1845. The closest options are option J: 1850. So that would be the answer, but wait, let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, let me recalculate. Let's compute hc/E again.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

E = 0.67 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 1.07314e-19 J

So hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Wait, no, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = (6.626 *3) = 19.878, and 1e-34 *1e8 = 1e-26. So, hc = 19.878e-26 J·m.

Then, E is 1.07314e-19 J.

So λ = hc/E = (19.878e-26 J·m) / (1.07314e-19 J) = (19.878 / 1.07314) *10^(-26 +19) ) = approx 18.5 * 1e-7 m = 1.85e-6 m = 1850 nm.

Ah, so that's 1850 nm, which is option J.

Wait, but I thought the bandgap of germanium was 0.67 eV. Let me confirm that. Oh yes, Ge has a bandgap of about 0.67 eV at 300 K, yes. So that calculation should be correct.

So the correct answer should be option J:1850 nm.

To determine the wavelength of the photon required to cause an electron to jump from the valence band to the conduction band in germanium at 300 K, we start by using the relationship between the energy of the photon and its wavelength:

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

Here, \( h \) is Planck's constant (\( 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)), \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)), and \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of the photon. Rearranging for \( \lambda \), we get:

\[
\lambda = \frac{hc}{E}
\]

The energy gap (\( E \)) for germanium at 300 K is approximately \( 0.67 \, \text{eV} \). To use this in the formula, we convert \( E \) from electron volts to joules using the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \):

\[
E = 0.67 \, \text{eV} \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV} = 1.073 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
\]

Next, calculate \( hc \):

\[
hc = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \times (3.0 \times 10^8) = 1.9878 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J·m}
\]

Now, substitute \( hc \) and \( E \) into the equation for \( \lambda \):

\[
\lambda = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{1.073 \times 10^{-19}} = 1.85 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
\]

Convert \( \lambda \) to nanometers (\( 1 \, \text{nm} = 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \)):

\[
\lambda = 1.85 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} = 1850 \, \text{nm}
\]

Thus, the wavelength of the photon required is approximately \( 1850 \, \text{nm} \), which corresponds to option **J**.
