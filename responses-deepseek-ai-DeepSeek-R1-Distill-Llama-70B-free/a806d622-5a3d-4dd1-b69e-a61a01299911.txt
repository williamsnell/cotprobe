Okay, so I have this question about business objectives and which ones are suitable under certain conditions. Let me try to break it down.

The question says that the objectives are often the most suitable when firms operate in a market dominated by a major competitor and their financial resources are limited. I need to choose the correct option from A to H.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that companies have different strategic objectives depending on their situation. Let me think about each option:

A: Hold objectives. I think this is about maintaining the current position, not growing or shrinking. Maybe when a company wants to stabilize.

B: Expansion objectives. That sounds like when a company wants to grow, maybe enter new markets or increase market share. But if they have limited resources, expansion might be tough.

C: Market objectives. These are about achieving specific market-related goals, like increasing sales or market share. But again, if there's a dominant competitor, maybe it's not the best fit.

D: Competitive objectives. These could involve competing directly with others, perhaps through pricing or product features. But if the competitor is major and you're small, maybe this isn't the best approach.

E: Niche objectives. Oh, right, niche strategies are about focusing on a specific segment of the market. That makes sense when you can't compete head-on with a major player because you don't have enough resources. So you find a niche where you can excel.

F: Harvest objectives. I think harvesting is about milking a product for profits without investing much, maybe when the market is declining. Not sure if that's the case here.

G: Divest objectives. That's about selling off parts of the business, which doesn't fit the scenario where they're trying to operate, not exit.

H: Growth objectives. Similar to expansion, focusing on growing the business. But with limited resources and a dominant competitor, growth might be difficult without a specific strategy.

Wait, so the company is in a market with a major competitor and has limited financial resources. So they can't compete directly. Instead, they should focus on a niche where they can be competitive without heavy investment. That would make E: Niche objectives the correct answer.

I think that's it. So the answer should be E.

The correct answer is E: Niche objectives.

When a firm operates in a market dominated by a major competitor and has limited financial resources, focusing on a niche strategy is most suitable. This approach allows the firm to target a specific segment where it can excel without directly competing with the dominant player, thereby optimizing its limited resources.

Answer: E
