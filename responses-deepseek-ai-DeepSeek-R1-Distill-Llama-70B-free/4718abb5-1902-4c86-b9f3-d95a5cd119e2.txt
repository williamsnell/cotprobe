Okay, so I've got this problem about a biconcave lens with a certain diopter value and radii of curvature. My goal is to find the refractive index of the glass. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think I can work through it.

First, I remember that for lenses, the diopter (which is the reciprocal of the focal length in meters) is related to the radii of curvature and the refractive index. The formula I think is the Lensmaker's equation. Oh right, the Lensmaker's formula! It's something like 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2), where n is the refractive index, and R1, R2 are the radii of curvature.

Wait, wait. But wait, the lens is biconcave. Biconcave lenses have both surfaces curving inward. So each radius is negative according to the sign conventions. Let me get the signs right. In the Lensmaker's formula, R is positive if the surface is convex towards the incoming light. Oh right, for a biconcave lens, both radii are negative because each surface is concave when viewed from outside the lens. So R1 and R2 would both be negative in this case.

Given in the problem, the radii of curvature for either surface are 12 cm each. So R1 is 12 cm and R2 is also 12 cm, but wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, no, for a biconcave lens, the radii are both negative. Because when the lens is biconcave, each surface is concave, which, according to the standard convention, would make R1 and R2 negative. But wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the radii are given as 12 cm for either surface. So the lens is symmetrical. So I think R1 is 12 cm, and R2 is -12 cm, but wait, no. I'm getting confused. Let me clarify the sign conventions.

Wait, the Lensmaker's formula uses the radii in a specific way. The first radius (R1) is for the first surface the light hits. If the surface is convex (like the outside of a typical converging lens), R1 is positive. If it's concave, R1 is negative. Similarly for the second surface, R2 is positive if it's convex on the second surface (the back), negative if concave.

But wait, for a biconcave lens, both surfaces are concave. So both R1 and R2 would be negative. Because when the light hits the first surface, it's concave, so R1 is negative. When it leaves the second surface, since that's also concave, R2 is negative as well.

But wait, wait, no. Wait, in a symmetrical lens, the two radii are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. So for a biconcave lens, since both are concave, both radii would be negative. Wait, but no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I got it wrong. Let me try to visualize a biconcave lens. It's like two concave surfaces. So the first surface (say, left) is concave, so R1 is negative. The second surface (right) is also concave, which would mean that when you look at it from the inside, the radius is negative as well. So both R1 and R2 are negative.

Wait, but that would lead to (1/R1 - 1/R2) = (1/(-12) - 1/(-12)) = (-1/12 + 1/12) = 0. That can't be right because the diopter isn't zero. Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake in the signs here.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let me double-check the Lensmaker's equation. The equation is: 

1/f = (n - 1) [ (1/R1) - (1/R2) ]

Wait, no, it's (1/R1) minus (1/R2) only when the lens is treated as having two surfaces, each facing the same direction. Oh wait, perhaps I should better think in terms of the standard formula.

Wait, another version I remember is that for a lens in air, the focal length is given by 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2), where R1 is the radius of curvature of the first surface and R2 is that of the second. But the signs of R1 and R2 depend on whether the surfaces are convex or concave. 

If the first surface is convex, R1 is positive; if concave, negative. Same for R2, but from the perspective after the light has passed through the first surface. So for a biconcave lens, both R1 and R2 are negative, because each surface is concave when viewed from the incoming direction.

Wait, no, maybe. Wait, for a biconcave lens, the first surface is concave (so R1 is negative), and the second surface is also concave (so R2 is negative as well). So substituting into the equation:

1/f = (n-1) [ (1/(-12 cm)) - (1/(-12 cm)) ) ]

Which would be (n-1) [ (-1/12 + 1/12 ) ] = (n-1) * 0 = 0. Hmm, that can't be right because the focal length would be infinite, which contradicts the given that the lens has a certain diopter.

Ah, I must be making a mistake here. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps in the case of a biconcave lens, the radii are treated differently. Maybe the second radius is considered positive. Because when light leaves the lens, the curvature is in the opposite direction.

Wait, maybe I should think of R1 as -12 cm and R2 as +12 cm. Let's try that.

So 1/f = (n-1) [ (1/R1) - (1/R2) ]

But wait, no, because R2 is the radius of the second surface as seen from the second medium, which is air. Let me try to get this straight.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses R1 as positive if the first surface is convex towards the incoming light, and R2 as positive if the second surface is convex towards the outgoing light.

Wait, for a biconcave lens, the first surface (left) is concave. So R1 is negative. The second surface (right) is also concave, so when viewed from inside the lens, it's convex, but from the outside, it's concave. Hmm, maybe that's where I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to note that for a biconcave lens, both radii are negative because each surface is concave when viewed from the outside. So R1 = -12 cm, R2 = -12 cm.

Wait, but plugging those into the equation gives:

1/f = (n-1) [ (1/-12) - (1/-12) ] = (n-1)(-1/12 + 1/12) = 0. So 1/f would be zero, which implies f is infinite, which can't be right because the lens has a certain focal length.

Wait, that's impossible. So perhaps I've mixed up the signs. Maybe for a biconcave lens, R1 is negative and R2 is positive? Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I should think of R1 and R2 as the radii from the perspective of the incoming and outgoing medium. So for a biconcave lens, the first surface is concave, so R1 is negative. The second surface, when viewed from the inside, is convex, so R2 is positive.

Wait, let's try that. So R1 = -12 cm, R2 = +12 cm.

Then,

1/f = (n-1) [ (1/R1) - (1/R2) ]

Wait, no, I think the formula is (1/R1) - (1/R2) for a lens with two surfaces, but I might have that wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is (1/R1) + (1/R2), but I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the exact Lensmaker's equation. I think the correct form is:

1/f = (n - 1) * [ (1/R1) - (1/R2) ]

Wait, no, wait. Another source says:

The Lensmaker's equation is 1/f = (n - 1) [ 1/R1 - 1/R2 ]

But wait, no, I think I might have the formula wrong. Let me think again. No, wait, the correct formula is:

1/f = (n - 1) [ (1/R1) + (1/R2) ]

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, perhaps it's (1/R1) - (1/R2). Or wait, I'm getting mixed up because different sources sometimes present it differently based on sign conventions.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is 1/f = (n-1) [ (1/R1) - (1/R2) ], where R1 is the radius of the first surface and R2 is the radius of the second surface.

Wait, but if the lens is biconcave, then R1 is negative, and R2 is also negative. So let's plug that in.

But wait, with both R1 and R2 negative, (1/R1 - 1/R2) becomes (1/(-12) - 1/(-12)) )= (-1/12 + 1/12) = 0. So that's not working. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the sign assignment.

Alternatively, perhaps for a biconcave lens, R1 is negative and R2 is positive. Let me try that.

So R1 = -12 cm, R2 = +12 cm.

Then,

1/f = (n-1) [ (1/(-12)) - (1/(12)) ) ]

= (n-1) [ (-1/12) - (1/12) ) ]

= (n-1) [ (-2/12) ) ]

= (n-1) * (-1/6 )

Wait, but the diopter is given as -10.00 diopters. Because a biconcave lens is a diverging lens, so its focal length is negative. So f is -0.1 meters, since 1 diopter is 1/m.

So 1/f = -10 diopters.

So,

-10 = (n-1) * (-1/6 )

Multiply both sides by (-6):

(n-1) = (-10) * (-6) = 60

So n = 61? Wait, that's impossible because glass doesn't have a refractive index of 61. That's way too high. So I must have messed up the signs somewhere.

Hmm, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me try another approach. Maybe the correct formula for a lens in air is 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2), but with the signs adjusted based on the lens type.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that for a biconcave lens, both R1 and R2 are negative when using the formula. Let me try that.

So R1 = -12 cm, R2 = -12 cm.

Then,

1/f = (n-1) [ (1/(-12)) - (1/(-12)) ) ]

= (n-1) [ (-1/12 + 1/12) ) ]

= (n-1) * 0 = 0

Which again gives 1/f = 0, implying f is infinite, which is wrong.

Hmm, this isn't working. Maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Let me check.

Wait, I think I might have the formula backward. Another version I found is:

1/f = (n-1) (1/R1 + 1/R2 )

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2), but considering that for a biconcave lens, one radius is positive and the other negative.

Wait, perhaps for a biconcave lens, R1 is negative and R2 is positive. Let's try that.

So R1 = -12 cm, R2 = +12 cm.

Then,

1/f = (n-1) [ (1/-12) - (1/12) ) ]

= (n-1) [ (-1/12) - (1/12) ) ]

= (n-1) * (-2/12 )

= (n-1)*(-1/6)

Given that the lens is biconcave, it's a diverging lens, so f is negative. The given diopter is -10, so 1/f = -10 m⁻¹.

So,

-10 = (n-1) * (-1/6 )

Multiply both sides by (-6):

(n-1) = (-10) * (-6) = 60

So n = 61. Again, impossible. So this approach isn't working.

Wait, perhaps I should reverse R1 and R2. Let me try R1 = +12 cm and R2 = -12 cm.

So,

1/f = (n-1) [ (1/12) - (1/(-12)) ) ]

= (n-1) [ (1/12 + 1/12) ) ]

= (n-1) * (2/12 )

= (n-1) * (1/6 )

Given that 1/f is -10, so:

-10 = (n-1) * (1/6 )

Multiply both sides by 6:

n-1 = -60

n = -59

Wait, that's negative, which is impossible for a refractive index. So this can't be right either.

Hmm, I must be making a mistake in assigning the signs. Let me try to look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that for a biconcave lens, the radii are both negative because each surface is concave. So R1 = -12 cm, R2 = -12 cm.

So,

1/f = (n-1) [ (1/R1) - (1/R2) ]

= (n-1) [ (1/-12) - (1/-12) ) ]

= (n-1) * 0 = 0 → 1/f = 0 → f is infinite, which is wrong.

So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe it's 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 + 1/R2), but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, let me think again. The Lensmaker's equation in air is:

1/f = (n - 1) [ (1/R1) - (1/R2) ]

Where R1 is the radius of curvature of the first surface (left), and R2 is the radius of curvature of the second surface (right). The signs are determined as follows:

- If the surface is convex towards the incoming light, R is positive.

- If concave, R is negative.

So, for a biconcave lens, both surfaces are concave. So R1 is negative, R2 is negative.

Wait, but then let's plug in the numbers again.

R1 = -12 cm, R2 = -12 cm.

1/f = (n-1) [ (1/-12) - (1/-12) ) ] = 0 → 1/f = 0 → f = infinity. That's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the reciprocal of the radii as (1/R1 + 1/R2) instead of (1/R1 - 1/R2). Let me try that.

So,

1/f = (n-1) [ (1/R1) + (1/R2) ]

With R1 = -12, R2 = -12.

Then,

1/f = (n-1) [ (-1/12) + (-1/12) ) ] = (n-1) * (-2/12) = (n-1)(-1/6)

Given that 1/f is -10 (since f is -0.1 m), we have:

-10 = (n-1) * (-1/6 )

Multiply both sides by (-6):

n-1 = 60 → n=61. Again impossible.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the formula wrong. Let me check another source.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula as 1/f = (n-1) [ 1/R1 + 1/R2 ] but with different signs for R1 and R2.

Wait, another approach: For a symmetrical biconcave lens, the radii are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. Wait, no, that would be a plano-convex or something else.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is arising because I'm not considering the direction from which the light approaches. Let's think of the lens as having two concave surfaces, so when light hits the first surface (left), it's concave, so R1 is negative. When light exits the second surface (right), it's also concave, so from the perspective of the outgoing medium (air), the radius is positive. So R2 is positive? Or negative?

Wait, maybe R2 is positive because when the light exits, the surface is convex from inside the lens. Hmm, perhaps I should think that for the second surface, if the light is exiting into air, and the surface is concave, then R2 is positive because it's convex from the inside.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me try to approach this differently. Let's look for the correct sign convention.

In the Lensmaker's formula, for a lens in air:

- R1 is positive if the first surface is convex outward (i.e., the light hits a convex surface first).

- R2 is positive if the second surface is convex outward (i.e., the exiting surface is convex).

For a biconcave lens, the first surface is concave outward, so R1 is negative. The second surface is also concave outward, so R2 is negative as well.

So R1 = -12 cm, R2 = -12 cm.

Then,

1/f = (n-1) [ (1/R1) - (1/R2) ]

= (n-1) [ (1/-12) - (1/-12) ) ]

= (n-1) [ (-1/12 + 1/12) ) ]

= 0 → 1/f = 0 → f = infinity, which is impossible.

Hmm, this suggests that the lens would have no focusing power, which isn't the case. So I must be making a mistake in the sign assignments.

Wait, perhaps I should reverse
