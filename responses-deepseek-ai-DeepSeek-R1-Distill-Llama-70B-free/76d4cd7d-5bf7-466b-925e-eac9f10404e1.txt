Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me see what it's about. The question says that on average, 46% of the loci in a species' gene pool are heterozygous. I need to find the average homozygosity of the species from the options given.

Hmm, wait, what do I remember about heterozygosity and homozygosity? I think heterozygous means that the two alleles at a locus are different, like Aa. Whereas homozygous means both alleles are the same, either AA or aa. So each locus can be either heterozygous or homozygous.

The question gives that 46% are heterozygous. So I guess the rest must be homozygous. Because if a locus isn't heterozygous, it's homozygous. Oh wait, because those are the only two possibilities for a diploid organism, right? So if 46% are heterozygous, the percentage that's homozygous would be 100% minus 46%.

Let me calculate that. 100 minus 46 equals 54. So the average homozygosity should be 54%. Looking at the options, option A is 54%, so that's probably the answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. I remember something about calculating heterozygosity (H) and homozygosity (which would be 1 - H). Oh wait, right! Because heterozygosity is the probability that two randomly chosen alleles are different. So if H is 46%, then homozygosity is 54%, which matches what I thought earlier.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is for each locus, the chance of being heterozygous is 46%, so the chance of being homozygous is the remaining. So yes, 54% makes sense.

I don't think I'm missing anything here. The answer should be A: 54%.

The question asks for the average homozygosity of a species where 46% of the loci are heterozygous. Since heterozygous loci have two different alleles (e.g., Aa) and homozygous loci have two identical alleles (e.g., AA or aa), the total percentage of loci must sum to 100%. Therefore, the percentage of homozygous loci is calculated as:

\[
\text{Homozygosity} = 100\% - \text{Heterozygosity} = 100\% - 46\% = 54\%.
\]

This matches option A.
