Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about the attenuation of gamma radiation through Bismuth. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can work through it step by step.

The problem says Bismuth has a density of 9.80 × 10³ kg/m³. Oh wait, density is mass per volume, right? So that's kg per cubic meter. But wait, the half thickness is given in grams per square centimeter, which is g/cm². I'll need to convert units at some point.

The half thickness is 12 g/cm². Half thickness is the amount of mass per area that reduces the intensity by half. So, the concept here is about exponential decay of radiation intensity as it passes through a material.

The question asks for the percent decrease in intensity at a depth of 1.5 cm. I think the formula for intensity after passing through a thickness x is I = I0 * (1/2)^(x / H), where H is the half thickness. Wait, no, actually, I think it's I = I0 * exp(-μ x), where μ is the linear attenuation coefficient. Or is it using the mass absorption coefficient?

Wait, maybe I should clarify. The mass absorption coefficient (μ/ρ) relates to the attenuation per unit mass per area. So, when they give the half thickness in mass per area (g/cm²), I can use that to find the attenuation.

Alternatively, since the half thickness is given, I can express the attenuation using the formula I/I0 = (1/2)^(x/H), where x is the depth in the same units as H. But wait, H is given in g/cm², which is mass per area. So, to use that, I need to figure out what the actual thickness (in cm) corresponds to a certain mass per area.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the mass thickness, which is the product of density (g/cm³) and thickness (cm), giving g/cm². Oh right, because density is mass/volume: g/cm³. So, when you multiply by thickness in cm, you get (g/cm³) * cm = g/cm².

So for a given thickness x (in cm), the mass thickness is density * x. So, to find the equivalent mass per area, you do density * x.

In this problem, the depth is 1.5 cm. So the mass thickness would be density (g/cm³) * x (cm) = mass per area (g/cm²). Wait, but the density given is in kg/m³. I need to convert that to g/cm³ because the half thickness is in g/cm².

Let me convert the density. 1 kg is 1000 g, 1 m is 100 cm. So density in kg/m³ is (kg/m³) * (1000 g/kg) / (100 cm/m)^3. So 1000 g / (1e6 cm³) ) --> 1e-3 g/cm³. Wait, no, wait:

Wait, 1 m³ is (100 cm)^3 = 1e6 cm³. 1 kg is 1000 g. So kg/m³ = (1000 g) / (1e6 cm³) ) = 0.001 g/cm³. So 9.80 ×10³ kg/m³ = 9.80 ×10³ * 0.001 g/cm³ = 9.8 g/cm³.

Wait, let me check that again. 1 kg/m³ is 1 kg per 1 m³. Since 1 m is 100 cm, 1 m³ is (100 cm)^3 = 1,000,000 cm³ = 1e6 cm³.

So 1 kg/m³ = (1 kg) / (1e6 cm³) ) = 1000 g / 1e6 cm³ = 0.001 g/cm³. So 9.80e3 kg/m³ = 9800 kg/m³, which is 9800 * 0.001 g/cm³ = 9.8 g/cm³.

Right, so the density is 9.8 g/cm³.

Now, the depth is 1.5 cm. The mass thickness is density (g/cm³) * depth (cm) = 9.8 g/cm³ * 1.5 cm = 14.7 g/cm².

Wait, that's the mass per area. So the mass thickness x_ρ is 14.7 g/cm².

The half thickness H is 12 g/cm². So the number of half thicknesses passed through is x_ρ / H = 14.7 / 12 ≈ 1.225.

So the intensity reduction factor is (1/2)^(x_ρ/H) = (1/2)^1.225 ≈ ?

Let me compute that. Let me think in terms of logs. ln(0.5^1.225) = 1.225 * ln(0.5) = 1.225 * (-0.6931) ≈ -0.848.

So exponentiating, e^(-0.848) ≈ 0.428. So the intensity is about 42.8% of the initial intensity.

Wait, but wait, the formula I used was I = I0 * (1/2)^(x/H). Another approach is using the attenuation formula with the mass absorption coefficient.

Wait, the mass absorption coefficient μ/ρ is given, perhaps? Or is the half thickness given as H = (ln 2)/(μ/ρ) * (1/density)? Hmm, no, maybe I should think again.

Alternatively, the formula for the attenuation is I = I0 * exp( - (μ/ρ) * x * density ), but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify.

Wait, the mass absorption coefficient μ_ρ is in cm²/g. So the attenuation equation is I = I0 * exp( - μ_ρ * (density * x) ). Because density * x gives mass per area.

Wait, since μ_ρ is the mass absorption coefficient, the term μ_ρ * (density * x) would be unitless because μ_ρ is cm²/g, density is g/cm³, x is cm. So (cm²/g) * (g/cm³) * (cm) )= cm²/g * g/cm² = 1. So yes, the exponent is unitless.

But let's think about the half thickness H. H is the mass thickness (in g/cm²) needed to reduce intensity to half. So when μ_ρ * H = ln(2), because I/I0 = 1/2, so ln(1/2) = - μ_ρ * H → μ_ρ = ln(2)/H.

So for this problem, H is 12 g/cm². So μ_ρ = (ln 2) / H = 0.6931 / 12 ≈ 0.05776 cm²/g.

Then, the mass thickness x_ρ is 14.7 g/cm² as calculated earlier. So the exponent is μ_ρ * x_ρ = 0.05776 * 14.7 ≈ 0.848.

So I/I0 = e^(-0.848) ≈ 0.428. So the intensity is about 42.8% of I0.

The percent decrease is (1 - 0.428) *100% ≈ 57.2% decrease.

Looking at the options, option G is 57.15%. That's close. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but wait, let me recheck the calculations.

Calculating x_ρ: 9.8 g/cm³ * 1.5 cm = 14.7 g/cm². Correct.

H is 12 g/cm². So x_ρ/H = 14.7/12 = 1.225.

(1/2)^1.225 = e^(1.225 * ln(0.5)) ) = e^(1.225 * (-0.6931)) ≈ e^(-0.848) ≈ 0.428.

So I/I0 ≈ 0.428 → 42.8% remaining, so decrease is 100 -42.8 = 57.2%. The closest option is G:57.15% which might be a more precise calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 0.848 more accurately. Let me compute 1.225 * ln(1/2).

ln(1/2) is approximately -0.69314718.

So 1.225 * (-0.69314718) = let's compute it:

1.225 * 0.69314718 = let's compute this accurately.

1 * 0.69314718 = 0.69314718

0.225 * 0.69314718 = ?

0.2 * 0.69314718 = 0.138629436

0.025 * 0.69314718 = approx 0.017328929

So 0.138629436 + 0.017328929 = 0.155958365

Total: 0.69314718 + 0.155958365 = 0.849105545 → but since it's multiplied by 1.225, which is 1 + 0.225, so 0.8491.

But since the original was negative, it's -0.849105545.

So e^(-0.849105545) = ?

Compute e^(-0.8491). I know that e^(-0.8) ≈ 0.4493, e^(-0.85) ≈ 0.4274.

Wait, let me compute more accurately.

Perhaps using a Taylor series or calculator-like approach, but I don't have a calculator here. Alternatively, I can remember that ln(0.43) is around -0.843, so e^(-0.8491) is about 0.428, as I thought earlier.

So 57.2% decrease. The options don't have 57.2%, but option G is 57.15%. So I'm guessing that perhaps, in the precise calculation, it comes out to 57.15%.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation uses more precise numbers, like for the density.

Wait, let me see. The density is 9.80 ×10^3 kg/m³. Converting to g/cm³:

9.80e3 kg/m³ = 9.80e3 * (1000 g / 1 kg) ) / (100 cm)^3/m³.

Wait, 1 m³ is (100 cm)^3 = 1e6 cm³.

So 9.80e3 kg/m³ * (1000 g/kg) / (1e6 cm³/m³) )= (9.80e6 g/m³) / (1e6 cm³/m³) )= 9.80 g/cm³.

So that's correct.

Then 1.5 cm * 9.80 g/cm³ = 14.7 g/cm².

H is 12 g/cm².

So x_ρ/H =14.7/12=1.225.

So (1/2)^1.225 = 2^(-1.225) → let's compute that.

Wait, 2^1 = 2

2^0.225: let's compute.

Log base 2: 0.225 is approximately log2(1.174), but perhaps better to compute natural logs.

Let me compute ln(2^0.225) =0.225 * ln2 ≈0.225 * 0.6931≈0.1559.

So e^0.1559 ≈1.169.

So 2^1.225 = 2^(1 + 0.225) =2^1 * 2^0.225 ≈ 2 * 1.169 ≈2.338.

So 2^(-1.225)=1/2.338≈0.4278.

So I/I0 ≈0.4278 → 42.78% intensity.

So percent decrease is 100% -42.78% =57.22%.

Hmm, but the option G is 57.15%. Close, but perhaps due to more precise calculation of logs.

Wait, perhaps using more precise numbers.

Let me compute 1.225 * ln(0.5) more accurately.

ln(0.5)= -0.69314718056.

1.225 * (-0.69314718056) = let's compute 1.225 *0.69314718056.

1.225 * 0.69314718056 = ?

Compute 1 * 0.69314718056 =0.69314718056.

0.2 * 0.69314718056 = 0.13862943611.

0.02 * 0.69314718056 = 0.013862943611.

0.005 *0.69314718056=0.0034657359.

Adding them: 0.69314718056 +0.13862943611=0.83177661667.

+0.013862943611= 0.84563956028.

+0.0034657359= 0.84910529618.

So 1.225 * 0.69314718056 ≈0.849105296.

So with the negative, it's -0.849105296.

e^(-0.849105296)= ?

Looking for e^-0.8491. Let me think about known exponentials.

e^-0.8= 0.449328966.

e^-0.85=?

Since e^-0.8=0.4493,

e^-0.05= approx 0.9512.

So e^-0.85 = e^-0.8 * e^-0.05 ≈0.4493 *0.9512≈0.4274.

But our exponent is -0.8491, which is slightly less than 0.85. So e^-0.8491≈0.4274 + a bit more.

Wait, let's compute e^-0.849105296.

We can compute using the Taylor series around x=0.85.

Alternatively, perhaps accept that it's approximately 0.4278 and the percent decrease is about 57.22%.

Looking at the options, the closest is G:57.15%. So perhaps the precise calculation would give 57.15% decrease.

Wait, wait another approach. Maybe using the exact formula.

Wait, H is the half-value layer, which is the mass thickness that reduces the intensity to half. So the formula is I=I0*(1/2)^(x/H), where x is the mass thickness.

In this case, x is 14.7 g/cm², H is 12 g/cm². So (x/H)=14.7/12=1.225.

So (1/2)^1.225 = 2^-1.225.

Take natural log: ln(2^-1.225)= -1.225 * ln2 ≈-1.225 *0.693147≈-0.8491.

So I/I0= e^-0.8491≈ 0.4278.

So I=42.78% I0.

So the decrease is 100-42.78=57.22%.

The options don't have 57.22, but option G is 57.15%. So perhaps in the calculation, they considered more precise exponents.

Alternatively, perhaps during the calculation, more precise values of the natural logarithm were used.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 2^-1.225 more accurately.

Let me compute 1.225 in binary exponents.

But perhaps it's easier to compute with logs.

Compute log10(2)=0.3010.

So log10(2^1.225)=1.225 *0.3010 =0.3683.

So 10^(-0.3683) = ?

We know that 10^-0.3≈0.501, 10^-0.3683≈?

Wait, 10^(-0.36)= approx 0.4359.

10^(-0.3683) is a bit lower, maybe around 0.43.

Wait, perhaps using exact calculation.

Wait, 10^(-0.3683) = e^(-0.3683 * ln10) ≈ e^(-0.3683 *2.3026) ) ≈ e^(-0.847) ≈ same as before, 0.428.

So 2^-1.225= ~0.428.

Thus, the same result.

So I'm confident that the decrease is about 57.2%, which is closest to option G, 57.15%.

Wait, but why is 57.15% an option? Maybe because the calculation uses the precise value of ln(2) and more precise exponentials, perhaps rounding to two decimal places earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: compute the number of H layers.

x_ρ=14.7 g/cm², H=12 g/cm².

So n=14.7/12=1.225 layers.

Each layer reduces intensity by half, so for n layers, it's (1/2)^n.

So for n=1.225, 2^-1.225= e^(-1.225 ln 2 )= same as before.

So if I calculate it precisely, perhaps using a calculator, 2^-1.225 is approximately 0.4278.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator, let's see:

What's 2^1.225?

We can compute it as 2^1 * 2^0.225.

2^0.225: Let me compute ln(2^0.225)=0.225 * ln2≈0.225 *0.6931≈0.1559.

So e^0.1559 ≈1.1695.

So 2^1.225=2 *1.1695≈2.339.

So 2^-1.225=1/2.339≈0.4273.

So I/I0=0.4273, so 42.73% remains. Thus, decrease is 100-42.73=57.27%.

So approximately 57.27% decrease. The option G is 57.15%, which is quite close, but perhaps due to rounding.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using the formula I = I0 * e^(-μ_rho * x_rho), where μ_rho is the mass absorption coefficient.

Wait, but we can compute μ_rho as (ln2)/H, where H is in g/cm².

So μ_rho = ln2 / H = 0.6931 /12 ≈0.0577625 cm²/g.

Then, x_rho is 14.7 g/cm².

So the exponent is μ_rho * x_rho = 0.0577625 *14.7 = let's compute that.

0.
