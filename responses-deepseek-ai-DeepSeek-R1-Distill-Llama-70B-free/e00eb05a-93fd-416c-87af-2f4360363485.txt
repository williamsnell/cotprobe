Okay, so I've got this problem about a parallelogram ABCD, and I'm supposed to find the measure of angle C. Hmm, I remember that in a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. Wait, so angle A should be equal to angle C, and angle B equals angle D. But wait, I think I might have that backwards. Let me think again. Oh right, in a parallelogram, opposite sides are parallel and opposite angles are equal. So if angle B is 110 degrees, then angle D should also be 110 degrees because they're opposite each other.

But wait, the question is asking for angle C. So angle C is opposite angle A. Since I know that consecutive angles in a parallelogram are supplementary, meaning they add up to 180 degrees. So angle A and angle B are consecutive, right? So angle A plus angle B equals 180 degrees. Since angle B is 110, angle A would be 180 minus 110, which is 70 degrees. But wait, angle C is opposite angle A, so angle C should also be 70 degrees. Oh wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 70 as an option. Wait, no, let me check the options again. Option G is 70. So maybe that's the answer.

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me visualize the parallelogram. Let's say ABCD is arranged so that points are in order A, B, C, D. So sides AB are parallel to CD, and AD parallel to BC. So angle at B is 110 degrees. Then, consecutive angles are supplementary, so angle A would be 70. Since opposite angles are equal, angle C would be 70 as well. So the measure of angle C is 70 degrees, which is option G.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes the labeling can be different. Maybe I should double-check how the angles relate. In a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. So if angle B is 110, angle C would be next to it. Oh wait, no. If the points are in order A, B, C, D, then angle B is at point B, and the next point is C, so angle B and angle C are consecutive. So if angle B is 110, angle C must be 180 - 110 = 70 degrees. Oh wait, that's a different approach but same answer. So angle C is 70 degrees. So the answer should be G.

In parallelogram \(ABCD\), opposite angles are equal, and consecutive angles are supplementary. Given that angle \(B\) measures \(110^\circ\), angle \(C\) is consecutive to angle \(B\). Since consecutive angles in a parallelogram add up to \(180^\circ\), angle \(C\) can be calculated as:

\[
\text{Measure of angle } C = 180^\circ - 110^\circ = 70^\circ
\]

Thus, the measure of angle \(C\) is \(70^\circ\), which corresponds to option \(G\).
