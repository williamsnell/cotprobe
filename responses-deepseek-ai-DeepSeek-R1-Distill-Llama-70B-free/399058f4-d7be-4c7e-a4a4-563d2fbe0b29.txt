Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the resultant force on a body that weighs 48 lb and has an acceleration of 6 ft/sec². Hmm, right, I remember that force is related to mass and acceleration, but wait, the weight is given in pounds, which is a unit of force, not mass. That might be a bit confusing.

Wait, Newton's second law says F equals m times a. But here, the weight is given as 48 lb. Oh, right, weight is the force due to gravity, so weight (W) equals mass (m) times gravitational acceleration (g). So W = m * g. So if I have the weight, I can find the mass by dividing by g.

But wait, in this problem, we're looking for the resultant force. So maybe I don't need the mass because I can relate the weight directly to the force. Hmm, let me think. Oh wait, the weight is the force exerted by gravity on the body, which is F_gravity = m * g. So the mass is F_gravity divided by g. Then, the resultant force F_resultant would be m times the acceleration a. So putting it together, F_resultant = (F_gravity / g) * a.

So F_resultant = (48 lb / g) * 6 ft/s². But wait, what is g in this context? Oh, the standard gravitational acceleration is 32 ft/s². So plugging that in, F_resultant = (48 / 32) * 6.

Let me calculate that. 48 divided by 32 is 1.5. Then 1.5 multiplied by 6 is 9. Oh, wait, but the options don't have 9 lb as a choice in the correct spot. Wait, looking at the options, option C is 9 lb. So that's the answer.

Alternatively, another approach: Since weight W = m * g, so m = W/g. Then F = m * a = (W/g) * a. Plugging in the numbers, W is 48 lb, a is 6 ft/s², g is 32 ft/s². So F = (48/32)*6 = (3/2)*6 = 9 lb. Yep, same result.

Wait, but wait a second, the units. Because weight is in pounds, which is a force, and acceleration is in ft/s², which is correct. So the resultant force will also be in pounds. So 9 lb is correct. So the correct answer should be option C: 9 lb.

To determine the resultant force on a body weighing 48 lb with an acceleration of 6 ft/sec², we use Newton's second law, which states that force equals mass times acceleration (\(F = m \cdot a\)). However, the weight (\(W\)) is given as 48 lb, and weight is the force due to gravity, where \(W = m \cdot g\). Here, \(g\) is the gravitational acceleration, approximately \(32 \, \text{ft/sec}^2\).

First, solve for the mass (\(m\)) using the weight equation:  
\[
m = \frac{W}{g} = \frac{48 \, \text{lb}}{32 \, \text{ft/sec}^2} = 1.5 \, \text{lb-sec}^2/\text{ft}.
\]  

Next, calculate the resultant force (\(F_{\text{resultant}}\)) using \(F = m \cdot a\):  
\[
F_{\text{resultant}} = m \cdot a = 1.5 \, \text{lb-sec}^2/\text{ft} \cdot 6 \, \text{ft/sec}^2 = 9 \, \text{lb}.
\]  

Thus, the resultant force on the body is 9 lb. The correct answer is **C: 9 lb**.
