Question:

What is a demand schedule, a supply schedule, and market price?

Options:

A: A demand schedule is a table showing the relationship between the price of a good and the consumer's income. A supply schedule is a table showing how the cost of production affects the price of a good. Market price is the average price of a good across different markets.
B: A demand schedule is a detailed plan for a consumer's future purchases at varying price levels. A supply schedule is a forecast of a producer's future sales at different price points. Market price is the sum of the cost of production and a standard profit margin.
C: A demand schedule is the maximum price a consumer is willing to pay for various quantities of a good. A supply schedule is the minimum quantity a producer is willing to offer at different prices. Market price is determined by government intervention.
D: A demand schedule is a fixed amount of a good that a consumer can buy at any price. A supply schedule is a fixed amount of a good that a producer can sell at any price. Market price is an arbitrary price set by market regulators.
E: A demand schedule is the quantity of a good a consumer wants to buy. A supply schedule is the quantity of a good a producer wants to sell. Market price is the lowest price a producer is willing to charge.
F: A demand schedule is a record of previous purchases made by a consumer at different prices. A supply schedule is a record of previous sales made by a producer at different prices. Market price is the most commonly observed price in the market.
G: A demand schedule is a list of prices at which a consumer is indifferent to buying a good. A supply schedule is a list of prices at which a producer is indifferent to selling a good. Market price is the equilibrium price determined by a central planning authority.
H: A demand schedule is a list of all possible prices for a good. A supply schedule is a list of all possible quantities of a good. Market price is the highest price a consumer is willing to pay.
I: A demand schedule is a graph showing the relationship between price and quantity demanded. A supply schedule is a graph showing the relationship between price and quantity supplied. Market price is the price at which supply equals demand.
J: A demand schedule is a listing of the quantities of a good a consumer is willing to buy and the corresponding prices. A supply schedule is a listing of the quantities of a good a producer is willing to offer and the corresponding prices. Market price is the price at which the quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about economics, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's break it down.

The question asks about a demand schedule, supply schedule, and market price. I remember from my basic economics class that these are fundamental concepts. Let me think about each part.

First, a demand schedule. I think it's a table that shows how much of a good consumers are willing to buy at different price levels. So it's like, as price changes, the quantity demanded changes. It's usually inverse—when price goes up, quantity demanded goes down, right?

Then, the supply schedule. That should be similar but from the producer's side. It's a table showing how much producers are willing to sell at different prices. Here, as price increases, quantity supplied also increases because producers want to sell more when they can get a higher price.

Now, market price. This is the price where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied. It's the equilibrium point where the supply and demand curves intersect. So it's not just any price, but the specific one where the market balances out.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Demand schedule relates price and income. Wait, no, demand schedule is about price and quantity, not income. Income affects demand, but the schedule itself is price-quantity. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Talks about future purchases and sales. That sounds more like forecasts, not the schedules we're discussing. Plus, market price as sum of cost and profit? Doesn't sound right. I think market price is determined by supply and demand, not just adding costs and profit.

Option C: Demand as max price for various quantities. Hmm, that's not quite right. The demand schedule isn't about the maximum price, but how much quantity is demanded at each price. Also, market price determined by government? No, in a free market it's supply and demand.

Option D: Fixed amounts regardless of price. That doesn't make sense. Both demand and supply change with price, so fixed quantities at any price is wrong.

Option E: Demand as quantity wanted, supply as quantity wanted. That's somewhat correct, but market price as the lowest a producer will charge? Not exactly. Market price is where supply equals demand, so it's an equilibrium price, not necessarily the lowest.

Option F: Records of past purchases and sales. No, schedules are about current or potential quantities at various prices, not past data. Also, market price as most common? Not sure, but I think it's more about equilibrium.

Option G: Prices where they're indifferent. That seems off. Demand and supply schedules are about varying quantities at different prices, not being indifferent. And market price set by central authority? No, in a free market, it's the equilibrium.

Option H: Lists of all possible prices and quantities. That's too broad. Schedules are specific to price-quantity relationships, not just any list. Plus, market price as highest a consumer will pay—that's more like willingness to pay, not equilibrium.

Option I: Graphs of price vs quantity. Wait, a schedule is a table, but this option describes graphs. So I think this is incorrect because the question refers to schedules, which are tables, not graphs. So I is not right.

Option J: Listings of quantities and corresponding prices for both demand and supply. That fits. The demand schedule lists quantities consumers will buy at each price, and supply lists quantities producers will sell. And market price is where quantity demanded equals supplied. So J sounds correct.

Let me double-check what each term means. Demand schedule: table of price vs quantity demanded. Supply schedule: table of price vs quantity supplied. Market price: equilibrium where Qd=Qs. Yes, J matches this.

The question asks about the definitions of a demand schedule, supply schedule, and market price. Here's the analysis of each option:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. A demand schedule shows the relationship between price and quantity demanded, not income. Similarly, a supply schedule shows price and quantity supplied, not cost of production. Market price is not an average across markets.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Demand and supply schedules are not forecasts of future purchases or sales. Market price is determined by supply and demand, not by adding production cost and profit.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. A demand schedule is not about the maximum price a consumer will pay but the quantity demanded at different prices. Market price is not determined by government intervention in a free market.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Demand and supply schedules are not fixed quantities; they vary with price. Market price is not arbitrary.
- **Option E**: Partially correct but misleading. While it mentions quantities, it incorrectly defines market price as the lowest price a producer will charge, rather than the equilibrium price where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Schedules are not records of past transactions but show quantities at different prices. Market price is not the most commonly observed price.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Schedules are not about indifference to prices but show quantities at different prices. Market price is not set by a central authority in a free market.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. Schedules are not lists of all possible prices or quantities. Market price is not the highest price a consumer will pay.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. While it describes graphs, the question refers to schedules, which are tables, not graphs.
- **Option J**: Correct. A demand schedule lists quantities consumers will buy at different prices, a supply schedule lists quantities producers will sell at different prices, and market price is the equilibrium where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied.

**Answer: J**
