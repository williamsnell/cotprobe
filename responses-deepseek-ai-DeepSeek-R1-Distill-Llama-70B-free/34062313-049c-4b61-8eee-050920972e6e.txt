Answer:
    <think>
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to answer this Sartre question. Hmm, I remember that Sartre was an existentialist philosopher. The question is about what happens if God doesn't exist according to him. Let me think.

Wait, Sartre's main idea was that existence precedes essence, right? So humans exist first, and then through their choices and actions, they create their own essence or identity. If God doesn't exist, there's no higher power determining human nature or providing a set of moral rules. 

So, without God, humans are free to choose their actions, but this freedom brings responsibility. I think Sartre said something about being "condemned to be free" because we have no choice but to choose. That would mean option A is a possibility. 

But wait, the question is about what happens if God doesn't exist. So what's the consequence? I also remember that without God, life might seem meaningless, but Sartre didn't say that. Instead, he believed that we create our own meaning. So maybe options like F, H, or E could be related.

Option E says "anything is permissible," which sounds like moral relativism. But Sartre didn't exactly say that. He believed that with freedom comes responsibility, so just because you can do something doesn't mean you should. So E might not be correct.

Option A says "man is condemned to be free." That rings a bell. Sartre emphasized freedom and responsibility. So if God doesn't exist, man is free but that's a heavy burden because we have to take responsibility for our choices. So A makes sense.

Wait, what's the exact quote? I think it's "Man is condemned to be free; because once thrown into the world, he is free to choose." So yes, that would be option A.

But let me check the other options. Option B says moral values still exist, but without God, Sartre might argue that they don't come from a divine source. So maybe he'd say moral values are created by humans. Option C says morality is defined by society, which might be more of a sociological view, not necessarily Sartre's. He was more about individual choice than societal norms.

Option D is about man not existing, which doesn't make sense. Option F says no purpose to life, but Sartre would say we create our own purpose. Option G says humans aren't responsible, but that's the opposite of what Sartre believedâ€”they are responsible because they're free. Option H says life has no meaning, but again, Sartre would say we create our own meaning. Option I says morals come from nature, which I don't think is Sartre's view. Option J says morals are subjective, which could be true, but the more direct answer is about freedom.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be A: man is condemned to be free.

The question asks about Sartre's view on the consequences of God's nonexistence. Sartre, an existentialist, argued that without God, humans are free to choose their actions and create their own meaning in life. This freedom is both empowering and burdensome, as humans must take full responsibility for their choices. Sartre famously described this condition as "man is condemned to be free." 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Correct. Sartre's concept of freedom and responsibility aligns with this statement.
- **B, C, I, J**: These relate to morality but don't capture Sartre's central idea about freedom.
- **D, F, G, H**: These contradict Sartre's beliefs about human responsibility and the ability to create meaning.

Thus, the best answer is **A**.

A
