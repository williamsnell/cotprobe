Question:

A defendant was prosecuted for murder. At trial, the prosecutor called a police detective to testify. The detective, who questioned the defendant at the station house after his arrest, testified that the defendant initially declared his innocence. The detective further testified that when given the opportunity to take a lie detector test, the defendant refused. The defendant's attorney did not object to the detective's testimony. The defendant was convicted and sentenced to prison. The defendant, who is now represented by a new attorney, appeals, claiming that it was error to admit the detective's testimony. The appellate court should find

Options:

A: plain error, because the trial court should have acted on its own motion to order reference to the lie detector test stricken.
B: no error, because the defendant refused the lie detector test, implying guilt
C: harmless error, because the defendant's statements were admissions.
D: harmless error, because the defendant's refusal to take the lie detector test was relevant information for the jury.
E: harmless error, because the defendant was given the opportunity to defend his statements
F: harmless error, because the defendant's trial attorney failed to preserve the argument by timely objection.
G: plain error, because the detective's testimony was hearsay
H: plain error, because the defendant was not read his rights prior to the questioning
I: no error, because the detective's testimony was valid evidence
J: plain error, because admission of the detective's testimony violated the defendant's privilege against self-incrimination.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with what's admissible in a criminal trial. Let me break it down step by step.

So the scenario is a murder case where the prosecutor called a police detective to testify. The detective questioned the defendant after his arrest. The detective testified that the defendant initially declared his innocence, and when offered a lie detector test, the defendant refused. The defense attorney didn't object to this testimony, and now the defendant appeals, claiming it was error to admit that testimony.

The question is about whether the appellate court should find error and what kind. The options are A through J, each presenting a different legal reasoning.

First, I need to recall the relevant rules of evidence. I remember that statements made by a defendant can sometimes be admissible, but there are exceptions. Also, the use of lie detector tests in court is something I should think about.

So the detective's testimony includes two parts: the defendant's declaration of innocence and his refusal to take a lie detector test.

1. Declaration of Innocence: The defendant said he was innocent. That's an exculpatory statement. Wait, but is that hearsay? Because the detective is testifying about what the defendant said. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted. Here, the defendant's statement is being offered to show that he claimed innocence, which is relevant. But wait, under the rules, a defendant's statement is admissible under certain exceptions. However, if the defendant's statement is exculpatory, it might be admissible as a statement against interest? No, wait, a statement against interest is when it's incriminating. Exculpatory statements by the defendant are generally not admissible unless they fall under another exception, like present sense impression or something else, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the defendant is the accused, maybe his statements are admissible as an admission by a party opponent under FRE 801(d)(2)(A). Oh wait, yes! Because admissions by a party-opponent are exempt from hearsay. So the defendant's statement of innocence would be an admission, admissible as non-hearsay. So that part might be okay.

2. Refusal to Take a Lie Detector Test: The detective testified that the defendant refused the lie detector test. I remember that in some cases, a defendant's refusal can't be used against them. But wait, I'm trying to recall. There's a case called United States v. Hale where the Supreme Court held that the use of a defendant's post-arrest silence (after being given Miranda warnings) violates the Fifth Amendment because it's compelled and could be self-incriminating. But wait, does that apply here? Or is it more about the use of the refusal to take a lie detector test?

Wait, I think the key issue is whether the prosecution can introduce evidence of a defendant's refusal to take a lie detector test. I believe that such evidence is inadmissible because it's a form of compelled self-incrimination. The Fifth Amendment protects against being compelled to be a witness against oneself. So if the defendant refuses to take a lie detector test after being arrested, introducing that refusal could violate his Fifth Amendment rights because it's using his silence or refusal against him.

Alternatively, another angle is that the results of a lie detector are generally inadmissible as evidence because they're not reliable, but the refusal itself might be another issue. But the question is about the admissibility of the detective's testimony regarding the refusal, not the results.

So, if the defendant was in custody and had been read his Miranda rights, then his refusal to take the test might be considered an invocation of his right to remain silent. But wait, Miranda protects the right to remain silent and not answer questions. Does it extend to refusing a lie detector test? Hmm. I think that the courts have held that a defendant's refusal to take a lie detector test can't be used against him because it could infringe on his Fifth Amendment rights. Because taking the test could potentially lead to self-incrimination, so refusing is akin to exercising the right to remain silent.

So, if the prosecutor introduced evidence of the defendant's refusal to take the lie detector test, that would be error because it's using the defendant's assertion of his Fifth Amendment right against him. That would be a violation, making the testimony inadmissible.

Moreover, the defendant's attorney didn't object, so the issue is whether the appellate court can review it for plain error. Plain error is when the error is so fundamental that it affects the defendant's substantial rights, and the court should notice it even without an objection.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Plain error because the trial court should have acted on its own to strike the lie detector reference. That sounds possible because the testimony about the refusal was inadmissible.

Option B: No error because refusal implies guilt. But this is incorrect because the refusal is protected; it can't be used as evidence of guilt.

Option C: Harmless error because statements were admissions. Wait, the refusal part is a separate issue. The admission (statement of innocence) is admissible, but the refusal isn't. So if the refusal was erroneously admitted, then it's a separate issue. So C might not be correct.

Option D: Harmless error because refusal was relevant. But if the refusal was inadmissible, then it's not harmless error. Unless the error didn't affect the outcome, but that's a different assessment.

Option E: Harmless because defendant could defend his statements. Not sure how that applies.

Option F: Harmless error because trial attorney didn't object. Wait, no, harmless error is about whether the error affected the outcome, not about preservation. But if it's plain error, the court can review despite no objection.

Option G: Plain error because hearsay. Wait, the statement of innocence was admissible as an admission, so G might not be correct. The refusal part is not hearsay, it's about the defendant's action (refusal). So G isn't the right reason.

Option H: Plain error because rights not read. The question says the detective questioned the defendant after arrest, but it doesn't specify if Miranda warnings were given. So H might not be the issue here unless the questioning without Miranda renders the statements inadmissible. But the defendant's statement of innocence is exculpatory, so Miranda issues might not apply because the statement against interest exception might come into play. But I'm not certain about that. Alternatively, if Miranda wasn't given, the statements might be inadmissible, but the question doesn't state that.

Option I: No error because testimony was valid. If part of the testimony (refusal) was invalid, then I is incorrect.

Option J: Plain error because it violated the privilege against self-incrimination. That sounds correct because the refusal to take the lie detector test can't be used against the defendant as it violates the Fifth Amendment. So J would be the right choice.

Wait, but when the defendant was offered the lie detector test, was it after Miranda? If the defendant was in custody and under interrogation, then using his refusal would be a problem. If he wasn't under interrogation, maybe not. But the scenario says he was questioned after arrest, so probably in custody.

So the refusal to take the lie detector test would be protected under the Fifth Amendment. The detective's testimony about the refusal was improper, and the trial court should have excluded it. Since the defense didn't object, it's reviewed for plain error.

Looking back at the options, option J says it's plain error because it violated the privilege against self-incrimination. That matches. Option A talks about the trial court acting on its own, which would be the case for plain error.

Wait, but option J is about the privilege. So which is the better answer?

Alternatively, option A says plain error because the trial court should have struck the lie detector reference. So both A and J seem plausible, but I think J is more precise because it's about the Fifth Amendment violation.

Wait, but the lie detector refusal being used against the defendant is a Fifth Amendment issue. So J is correct.

But another thought: is the lie detector refusal considered an adoptive admission? Or is it more about the defendant's conduct. Alternatively, the prosecution using the refusal as substantive evidence of guilt would be improper because it's a form of compelled self-incrimination.

So yes, J is the right answer.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a police detective's testimony regarding the defendant's declaration of innocence and refusal to take a lie detector test. The defendant appeals, arguing that the testimony was erroneously admitted. The key issues are whether the testimony violated the defendant's Fifth Amendment rights and whether the appellate court should find error.

1. **Declaration of Innocence**: The defendant's statement of innocence is an exculpatory statement. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, admissions by a party-opponent (FRE 801(d)(2)(A)) are not considered hearsay and are admissible. Thus, this part of the testimony was likely admissible.

2. **Refusal to Take a Lie Detector Test**: The more critical issue is the testimony about the defendant's refusal to take a lie detector test. The Fifth Amendment protects individuals from being compelled to incriminate themselves. Courts have held that a defendant's refusal to take a lie detector test cannot be used against them, as it would constitute a violation of their Fifth Amendment rights. Introducing such evidence would be akin to penalizing the defendant for exercising their right to remain silent.

3. **Plain Error**: Since the defendant's attorney did not object to the testimony, the appellate court would review the issue for plain error. Plain error occurs when the error is fundamental, affects the defendant's substantial rights, and seriously impacts the fairness or integrity of the trial. Here, the admission of the refusal to take the lie detector test was a clear violation of the defendant's Fifth Amendment rights, making it plain error.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: While it correctly identifies plain error, it focuses on the trial court's duty to act on its own motion, which is less precise than the Fifth Amendment violation highlighted in Option J.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect, as the refusal to take a lie detector test does not imply guilt and is protected under the Fifth Amendment.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect, as the refusal to take the lie detector test was not an admission and its admission was not harmless.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect, as the refusal was not relevant information for the jury; it was inadmissible.
   - **Option E**: Incorrect, as the defendant's opportunity to defend his statements does not cure the Fifth Amendment violation.
   - **Option F**: Incorrect, as harmless error is about the impact on the outcome, not the preservation of the issue.
   - **Option G**: Incorrect, as the testimony about the refusal was not hearsay.
   - **Option H**: Incorrect, as the issue is not about Miranda warnings but the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.
   - **Option I**: Incorrect, as the testimony about the refusal was not valid evidence.
   - **Option J**: Correct, as the admission of the refusal violated the defendant's privilege against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment.

The correct answer is **J**, as the admission of the defendant's refusal to take the lie detector test violated his Fifth Amendment rights, constituting plain error.

**Answer: J**
