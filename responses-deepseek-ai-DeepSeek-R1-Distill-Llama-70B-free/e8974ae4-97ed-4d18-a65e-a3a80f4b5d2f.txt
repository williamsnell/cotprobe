Okay, so Ms. Gutierrez needs to order rope for her gym class, and she has 32 students. Each student gets a piece of rope that's 5 feet 8 inches long. I need to find the total length of rope she needs to order.

Hmm, I think the first step is to figure out how much rope each student uses and then multiply that by the number of students. But wait, the measurement is in feet and inches, so I should probably convert that into a single unit to make the multiplication easier.

So each student's rope is 5 feet and 8 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, I can convert the inches part into feet. Let me calculate that: 8 inches is 8/12 feet. 8 divided by 12 is... let's see, 8 divided by 12 is 0.666... So that's approximately 0.6667 feet.

So each rope is 5 + 0.6667 = 5.6667 feet long. Wait, but maybe it's easier to keep it in inches for the calculation. Let me think. Alternatively, I could convert the total length per student into inches first, then multiply by the number of students, and then convert back to feet and inches.

Right, that might be easier. So 5 feet is 5 * 12 = 60 inches, plus 8 inches makes 68 inches per student. 

Now, 32 students each getting 68 inches of rope. So I need to multiply 68 inches by 32. Let me do that math. 68 * 32... Hmm, let's break it down. 70 * 32 is 2240, but since 68 is 2 less than 70, I subtract 2*32 from 2240. 2*32 is 64, so 2240 - 64 = 2176 inches. 

Wait, no, wait, 68 * 32. Alternatively, 68 times 30 is 2040, and 68 times 2 is 136. So 2040 + 136 = 2176 inches total.

Now, I need to convert 2176 inches back into feet and inches. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, I can divide 2176 by 12. Let me do that division.

12 * 181 = 2172, because 12 * 180 is 2160, plus 12 is 2172. So 2176 - 2172 = 4 inches. So that means 2176 inches is 181 feet and 4 inches.

Wait, let me double-check that. 12 * 180 = 2160. 2176 - 2160 is 16. Oh wait, no, 2176 minus 12*181 would be 2176 - 2172 = 4 inches. So it's 181 feet and 4 inches. So the total rope needed is 181 feet 4 inches.

Looking at the options, option B is 181 feet 4 inches. So the answer should be B.

To determine the total length of rope Ms. Gutierrez needs to order, we start by calculating the rope length per student in inches. Each student receives a rope that is 5 feet 8 inches long. Converting 5 feet to inches gives:

\[
5 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 60 \text{ inches}.
\]

Adding the additional 8 inches:

\[
60 \text{ inches} + 8 \text{ inches} = 68 \text{ inches}.
\]

Next, we calculate the total rope length for all 32 students:

\[
68 \text{ inches/student} \times 32 \text{ students} = 2176 \text{ inches}.
\]

To convert this back to feet and inches, divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

\[
2176 \div 12 = 181 \text{ feet with a remainder of 4 inches}.
\]

Thus, the total length of rope needed is 181 feet 4 inches. Comparing this result to the provided options, the correct answer is:

**B: 181 feet 4 inches.**
