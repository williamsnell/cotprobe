Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating Jack Conlon's earnings over two weeks. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the problem says Jack is on a salary-plus-commission basis. That means he gets a fixed salary every week plus a commission based on his sales. The salary is $200 a week, and the commission is 3% of his sales. 

The question is asking for his earnings over two weeks when he had sales of $3,550. Hmm, wait, so I need to calculate both his salary and commission for that period and add them together.

Let me think about the salary part first. He earns $200 each week. So over two weeks, that would be 2 times $200. Let me calculate that: 2 * 200 = $400. Okay, got that part down.

Now, the commission. He gets 3% of his sales. His total sales over two weeks are $3,550. So I need to find 3% of 3,550. To calculate that, I can multiply 3,550 by 0.03. Let me do that: 3550 * 0.03. Hmm, 3550 times 0.03. Let's see, 3550 divided by 100 is 35.5, and 35.5 multiplied by 3 is 106.5. So the commission is $106.50.

Wait a second, let me double-check that calculation. Oh right, 3% is the same as 0.03. So 3550 * 0.03 equals 106.5. Yep, that's correct.

Now, I need to add the salary and the commission together to get the total earnings. The salary over two weeks is $400, and the commission is $106.50. So adding those together: 400 + 106.50 = 506.50. So his total earnings are $506.50.

Looking at the options, option J is $506.50. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me go through the steps again. Salary is $200 a week for two weeks: 200 * 2 = 400. Sales are 3550, commission is 3%, so 0.03 * 3550 = 106.50. Total earnings 400 + 106.50 = 506.50. Yep, that checks out. So the correct answer should be J.

Jack Conlon's earnings are calculated by adding his salary and commission over two weeks. His salary is $200 per week, so over two weeks, this amounts to $400. His commission is 3% of his total sales of $3,550, which is calculated as 0.03 Ã— 3,550 = $106.50. Adding these together gives a total of $400 + $106.50 = $506.50. 

The correct answer is J: $506.50.
