Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about calculating the minimum work required to compress 1 kg of ethylene from 0.1 m³ to 0.01 m³ at a constant temperature of 300 K. I need to consider both the ideal gas and VanderWaals gas cases.

Hmm, I remember that for an ideal gas, the work done during an isothermal compression can be calculated using the formula W = nRT ln(Vf / Vi), but wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, actually, the formula is W = nRT ln(Vi / Vf) because when you compress the gas, the volume decreases, so Vi is larger than Vf. So the work done on the gas would be positive in compression.

But wait, I also recall that work done by the gas is considered negative when the gas is compressed. Wait, but in physics, work done on the system is positive. So I think the formula for work done on the gas during compression would be positive. So the formula should be W = nRT ln(Vi / Vf). Let me make sure.

Right, because for expansion, the gas does work on the surroundings (so work is negative), and for compression, work is done on the gas (positive). So yeah, the formula should have Vi over Vf because Vi is larger.

So first, I need to compute this for the ideal gas case. But wait, the problem gives the mass as 1 kg. I'll need to find the number of moles. Ethylene is C2H4. Its molar mass is (2*12) + (4*1) = 24 +4 = 28 g/mol. So 1 kg is 1000 g. Moles n = 1000 / 28 ≈ 35.714 moles.

Wait, let's compute that accurately. 28 g/mol is 0.028 kg/mol. So n = 1 kg / 0.028 kg/mol ≈ 35.714 mol.

Now, R is the gas constant, 8.314 J/mol·K. So R T is 8.314 * 300 = 2494.2 J/mol. So nRT would be 35.714 mol * 2494.2 J/mol ≈ let me calculate that. 35 * 2500 is 87,500, but more accurately:

35.714 * 2494.2 ≈ Let's compute 35 * 2494.2 = 35 * 2400=84,000 and 35*94.2=3,297 → total 87,297. Then 0.714 * 2494.2 ≈ 0.7*2494=1745.8, 0.014*2494≈35.  So 1745.8 +35=1780.8. So total nRT ≈ 87,297 +1,780.8 ≈ 89,077.8 J, which is approximately 89,078 J or about 89.078 kJ.

Now, the natural log of Vi/Vf. Vi is 0.1 m³, Vf is 0.01 m³. So Vi/Vf = 10. Ln(10) is approximately 2.3026.

So the work W is nRT ln(Vi/Vf) = 89,078 J * 2.3026 ≈ Let me compute that. 89,078 * 2 = 178,156. 89,078 * 0.3 = 26,723.4. 89,078 *0.0026≈ 231.8. So adding all together: 178,156 + 26,723.4 = 204,879.4 + 231.8 ≈ 205,111.2 J. Which is approximately 205.11 kJ.

Wait, but looking at the options, the ideal gas case has 204.7 kJ as option C and J. Hmm. My approximation gives around 205 kJ, but perhaps a more precise calculation would get 204.7. Maybe I should check the exact values.

Let me recalculate n more accurately: 1000 /28 = 35.7142857 mol.

RT is 8.314 *300 = 2494.2 J/mol.

nRT = 35.7142857 *2494.2 = Let's compute 35 *2494.2 = 35 * 2000=70,000; 35*494.2=17,297 → total 87,297. 0.7142857 *2494.2 ≈ Let's compute 0.7 *2494.2=1745.94, 0.0142857 *2494.2≈35.714. So 1745.94 +35.714=1781.654. So total nRT = 87,297 +1781.654 = 89,078.654 J.

Multiply by ln(10)=2.302585093.

So 89,078.654 *2.302585093 ≈ Let's compute:

89,078.654 *2 = 178,157.308

89,078.654 *0.3 = 26,723.5962

89,078.654 *0.002585093 ≈ Approximately, 0.0025 is 222.696, and 0.000085093 is about 7.58. So total ≈ 222.696 +7.58=230.276.

Adding these up: 178,157.308 +26,723.5962 = 204,880.9042 + 230.276 ≈ 205,111.18 J, which is 205.111 kJ. But the options have 204.7 kJ. Hmm, perhaps I made a rounding error. Maybe the exact value is 204.7 kJ. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise calculations.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute nRT ln(Vi/Vf) more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps the ideal gas part is 204.7 kJ, which would correspond to option C and J. So for the ideal case, the work is approximately 204.7 kJ. So looking at the options, option C and J have that.

Now, the VanderWaals case is more complicated. The formula for work in a VanderWaals gas during isothermal compression is different because the equation of state is [P + a(n/V)^2](V/n - b) = RT. But for calculating work, which is the integral of P dV from Vi to Vf.

The work done W is the integral from Vi to Vf of P dV. For VanderWaals, P is [nRT/(V - nb)] - a (n/V)^2.

So W = integral from Vi to Vf of [nRT/(V - nb) - a (n²/V²)] dV.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure about the formula. VanderWaals equation is (P + a (n²/V²))(V/n - b) = RT. So solving for P: P = [nRT/(V - nb)] - a (n²/V²).

So the work done on the gas during compression is the integral from Vi to Vf of P dV.

So W = ∫ (from Vi to Vf) [nRT/(V - nb) - a (n²/V²)] dV.

So let's split the integral into two parts: ∫ [nRT/(V - nb)] dV - ∫ [a n² / V²] dV.

Compute each integral separately.

First integral: nRT ∫ [1/(V - nb)] dV from Vi to Vf.

Let me make substitution u = V - nb → du = dV.

So integral becomes nRT ln(u) evaluated from Vi to Vf → nRT [ln(Vf - nb) - ln(Vi - nb)] = nRT ln( (Vf - nb)/(Vi - nb) )

Second integral: a n² ∫ (1/V²) dV = a n² [ -1/V ] from Vi to Vf → a n² [ (-1/Vf) + (1/Vi) ) ] = a n² (1/Vi - 1/Vf )

So putting it all together, W = nRT ln( (Vf - nb)/(Vi - nb) ) + a n² (1/Vi - 1/Vf )

Wait, but wait: the second integral is subtracted, so:

W = nRT ln( (Vf - nb)/(Vi - nb) ) - a n² (1/Vf - 1/Vi )

Wait, wait, no. Because the integral was ∫ [a n² / V²] dV, which is a n² ( -1/V evaluated from Vi to Vf ), which is a n² [ (-1/Vf) - (-1/Vi) ) ] → a n² (1/Vi - 1/Vf )

So W = first part (from the first integral) minus the second part.

So W = nRT ln( (Vf - nb)/(Vi - nb) ) - a n² (1/Vi - 1/Vf )

Wait, no: the second integral is ∫ [a n² / V²] dV from Vi to Vf, which equals a n² (1/Vi - 1/Vf ). But since the expression is [nRT/(V - nb)] - [a n² / V²], the integral becomes [first integral] - [second integral]. So W = nRT ln( (Vf - nb)/(Vi - nb) ) - a n² (1/Vi - 1/Vf )

Wait, but for work done on the gas, is this the formula? Let me make sure about the sign.

Wait, in thermodynamics, work done by the system is negative when the system is compressed, so work done on the system is positive. So when calculating W as the integral of P dV, which is work done by the system, it would be negative for compression. But in this problem, the question is about work expended (i.e., work done on the gas), so we take it as positive. So perhaps the formula I derived is correct.

But in any case, let me proceed to compute it.

Now, I need the VanderWaals constants a and b for ethylene. I'm a bit unsure about the exact values. I think for ethylene (C2H4), the constants are:

a = 0.227 Pa·m⁶/mol² → Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, VanderWaals constants are typically given in units of (atm·L²/mol²) for a, and L/mol for b. Alternatively, in SI units, a is in Pa·m⁶/mol² and b is m³/mol.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the values. Let me think: for ethylene, the a and b values are approximately a = 0.227 L·atm/mol² and b = 0.05714 L/mol. Wait, I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, I might be mixing up with other gases. Alternatively, perhaps a is 0.227 L·atm/mol² and b is 0.05714 L/mol. Let me proceed with those values.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check. VanderWaals constants for ethylene:

After checking, I remember that for ethylene, a is approximately 0.227 L·atm/mol² and b is approximately 0.05714 L/mol.

Wait, but let me confirm. Another source says a = 0.227 L·atm/mol² and b = 0.05714 L/mol. So I'll proceed with those.

So a = 0.227 L·atm/mol², b = 0.05714 L/mol.

But wait, the units are in L and atm, while the volumes here are in m³. So I'll need to convert units appropriately.

Wait, because in the formula, V is in m³, but the VanderWaals constants a and b are in L·atm and L. So I'll need to convert V from m³ to L.

Wait, 1 m³ = 1000 L. So Vi = 0.1 m³ = 100 L, Vf=0.01 m³=10 L.

So let's compute each part step by step.

First, compute nRT ln( (Vf - nb)/(Vi - nb) )

n is approximately 35.714 mol.

R in L·atm units: I know that R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K.

So R*T = 0.0821 * 300 ≈ 24.63 L·atm/mol.

So nRT = 35.714 * 24.63 ≈ let's compute 35 *24.63= 862.05, 0.714 *24.63≈17.59 → total ≈ 862.05 +17.59= 879.64 L·atm.

Now, compute (Vf - nb) and (Vi - nb).

Vf =10 L, Vi=100 L.

nb = 35.714 mol * 0.05714 L/mol → 35.714 *0.05714 ≈ Let's compute 35 *0.05714=2.0, 0.714 *0.05714≈0.0408 → total ≈2.0408 L.

So Vf - nb =10 L - 2.0408 L ≈7.9592 L.

Vi - nb =100 L -2.0408 L ≈97.9592 L.

So the ratio (Vf - nb)/(Vi - nb) = 7.9592 / 97.9592 ≈0.0813.

Ln(0.0813) ≈-2.513.

So first term: nRT * ln(...) = 879.64 * (-2.513) ≈-2210.5 L·atm.

Wait, but wait, that's negative. Hmm, but work done on the gas should be positive, right? Or maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, the first term is nRT ln( (Vf - nb)/(Vi - nb) ), which is (7.9592 /97.9592) ≈0.0813 → ln(0.0813)= -2.513. So 879.64 * (-2.513)= approximately -2210 L·atm.

Now, the second term: a n² (1/Vi - 1/Vf )

a is 0.227 L·atm/mol².

n is 35.714 mol → n²= (35.714)^2 ≈1276.96 mol².

1/Vi =1/100 L⁻¹ =0.01 L⁻¹.

1/Vf=1/10 L⁻¹=0.1 L⁻¹.

So 1/Vi -1/Vf=0.01 -0.1= -0.09 L⁻¹.

So the term becomes 0.227 * 1276.96 * (-0.09).

Compute 0.227 *1276.96 ≈ Let's compute 0.2 *1276.96=255.392, 0.027 *1276.96≈34.477 → total≈289.869.

Multiply by (-0.09): 289.869 * (-0.09)= -26.088 L·atm.

So the second term is -26.088 L·atm.

So W = first term - second term → (-2210) - (-26.088) = -2210 +26.088 = -2183.912 L·atm.

Wait, but that gives a negative value for W. That doesn't make sense because work done on the gas during compression should be positive. Did I make a mistake in the formula?

Let me double-check the formula. The work done on the gas is the integral of P dV from Vi to Vf. Since the gas is being compressed, the volume decreases, and P is higher than for an ideal gas. So the work should be positive. But according to my calculation, it's negative. That can't be right. Where did I go wrong?

Ah, wait! The formula I used is W = ∫ P dV from Vi to Vf, which is the work done by the system. So if the system is compressed, the work done by the system is negative. Therefore, the work done on the system (which is what we're calculating) would be positive and equal to -∫ P dV from Vi to Vf. Oh, right! So perhaps I missed a negative sign.

So perhaps I should have W = - [nRT ln( (Vf - nb)/(Vi - nb) ) - a n² (1/Vi -1/Vf) ]

So let's correct that.

So W_on = - [nRT ln( (Vf - nb)/(Vi - nb) ) - a n² (1/Vi -1/Vf) ]

Which becomes: -nRT ln( (Vf - nb)/(Vi - nb) ) + a n² (1/Vi - 1/Vf )

So let's compute that.

First term: -nRT ln(0.0813) → -879.64 * (-2.513) = +2210 L·atm.

Second term: a n² (1/Vi -1/Vf) →0.227 *1276.96*(0.01 -0.1) →0.227*1276.96*(-0.09)= -26.088 L·atm.

So W_on = 2210 -26.088 = 2183.912 L·atm.

So approximately 2184 L·atm.

But wait, the options are in the range of 400,000 to 700,000 L·atm. So I must have made a mistake in the units somewhere.

Wait, because 1 L·atm is approximately 101.325 J. So 2184 L·atm would be about 2184 *101.325 ≈ 221,000 J or 221 kJ. But in the options, the VanderWaals work is in the options as negative numbers. Wait, no, looking at the options, they have negative values for VanderWaals, but that doesn't make sense. Because work done on the gas should be positive, so perhaps the options have a typo, or I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, looking at the options, for example, option C says 204.7 kJ for ideal and -515,320 l-atm for VanderWaals. But l-atm is liter-atmospheres. Wait, but in my calculation, I got 2184 L·atm, which is about 2184 L·atm. But the options have much larger numbers, like -515,320 L·atm. So perhaps I messed up the units.

Wait,
