Alright, so I've got this problem here about a doorman trying to get three taxicabs. The arrivals of empty cabs follow an exponential distribution with a mean of 2 minutes. I need to find the probability that all three couples are taken care of within 6 minutes. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that the exponential distribution is memoryless, which might come in handy. The probability density function for an exponential distribution is f(t) = λe^(-λt), where λ is the rate parameter. Since the mean is 2 minutes, that means λ is 1/2 per minute because λ = 1/mean.

Wait, the question is about the time until three cabs arrive. So maybe I should think about the minimum of three exponential variables, but wait, no, that's the case when we're looking for the first arrival. Here, we need all three to arrive within 6 minutes. So perhaps I should model the waiting time until the third cab arrives and ensure that this time is less than or equal to 6 minutes.

The arrival of each cab can be considered as events in a Poisson process. For a Poisson process, the number of arrivals in a given time follows a Poisson distribution. But here, it's about the time until a certain number of arrivals occur, which relates to the gamma distribution. Specifically, the sum of n independent exponential variables follows a gamma distribution with shape parameter n and rate λ.

Right, so the time until the third cab arrives is a gamma-distributed random variable with shape k=3 and rate λ=1/2. The gamma distribution's probability density function is f(t) = (λ^k t^{k-1} e^{-λt}) / (k-1)! ), for t ≥ 0.

But I don't need the density function directly. I need the cumulative distribution function (CDF) evaluated at t=6. The CDF for the gamma distribution gives P(T ≤ t), where T is the time until the third arrival.

The CDF of a gamma distribution doesn't have a simple closed-form expression, but I might remember that it can be expressed using the incomplete gamma function. Alternatively, for integer values of k, the CDF can be expressed as a sum of Poisson probabilities.

Wait, yes! For integer k, the CDF of the gamma distribution with shape k can be written as the sum from i=k to infinity of e^(-λt) ( (λ t)^i ) / i! ). But wait, no, that's the CDF for Poisson. Oh, wait, maybe I'm mixing things up here.

Wait, another approach: The event that all three cabs arrive within 6 minutes is equivalent to the event that the number of arrivals in 6 minutes is at least 3. Because if at least three cabs arrive in 6 minutes, then the doorman can take care of all three couples.

So, if I model the number of arrivals in 6 minutes as a Poisson random variable with parameter λ*t, where λ=1/2 and t=6. So λt = 3. So the number of arrivals, N, is Poisson with λ=3.

Then, the probability that N is ≥3 is 1 minus the probability that N is 0, 1, or 2.

So P(N ≥3) = 1 - [P(N=0) + P(N=1) + P(N=2)].

Calculating each term:

P(N=0) = e^{-3} (3^0)/0! = e^{-3} *1/1 = e^{-3}.

P(N=1) = e^{-3} (3^1)/1! = 3 e^{-3}.

P(N=2) = e^{-3} (3^2)/2! = (9/2) e^{-3}.

So adding them up:

P(N <3) = e^{-3} [1 + 3 + 9/2] = e^{-3} * (1 +3 +4.5) = e^{-3} *8.5.

Therefore, P(N≥3) = 1 - 8.5 e^{-3}.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again. 1 +3=4, plus 4.5 is 8.5? Yes. So 8.5 e^{-3}.

But wait, I'm not sure if this approach is correct. Because the original problem is about the time until three arrivals, which is a gamma distribution. But I'm now modeling the number of arrivals in a fixed time as Poisson.

Wait, wait, perhaps both approaches are equivalent. Because the number of arrivals in time t, N(t), is Poisson with λt. And the waiting time until the nth arrival is a gamma distribution.

So, the event that the third arrival happens by time t is the same as the event that N(t) ≥3.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the probability that the third couple is picked up by time t is equal to the probability that at least three cabs have arrived by t.

Therefore, my approach using the Poisson distribution to calculate P(N≥3) in t=6 is correct.

So, with λt = 3, the probability is 1 - [e^{-3} (1 + 3 + 9/2)].

Calculating 1 +3=4, plus 4.5 is 8.5. So 8.5 e^{-3} ≈ 8.5 * 0.0498 ≈ 0.423.

So 1 - 0.423 = 0.577, roughly 57.7% probability.

Wait, but looking at the options, the given choices are A-J with numbers 1-10, but the options are letters A-J, with the possible answers being numbers, but the options don't list 0.577 or anything. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, let me read the problem again. It says the arrival of empty cabs has an exponential distribution with mean 2 minutes. So each cab arrival is independent, exponential with λ=1/2.

The doorman needs three cabs. So the time until three cabs arrive is the sum of three exponential variables, which is a gamma(3, 1/2) distribution.

The CDF of the gamma distribution at t=6 gives the probability that the sum is ≤6.

The gamma CDF can be expressed as:

P(T ≤ t) = 1 - e^{-λ t} (1 + λ t + (λ t)^2 / 2! + ... + (λ t)^{k-1}/(k-1)! )).

Wait, no, for shape parameter k, it's up to (k-1) terms.

Wait, the gamma CDF for integer k is:

P(T ≤ t) = 1 - e^{-λ t} \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} ( (λ t)^i ) / i! )

Wait that's for the sum of k exponentials, yes.

So in this case, k=3, λ=1/2, and t=6.

So P(T ≤6) = 1 - e^{-(1/2)*6} [ ( ( (1/2)*6 )^0 )/0! + ( ( (1/2)*6 )^1 )/1! + ( ( (1/2)*6 )^2 )/2! ) ]

Simplify:

(1/2)*6 = 3.

So,

P(T ≤6) = 1 - e^{-3} (1 + 3 + 9/2 ) / (0! 1! 2! )

Wait, wait, denominator is 0! 1! 2!? No, each term is divided by i!.

So for i=0: 3^0 /0! =1.

i=1: 3^1 /1! =3.

i=2: 3^2 /2! =9/2 =4.5.

So sum is 1 +3 +4.5 =8.5.

So P(T ≤6) =1 - e^{-3} *8.5.

Wait, this is the same result as before. So about 1 - 8.5 * e^{-3}.

Calculating e^{-3} is approximately 0.049787.

So 8.5 * 0.049787 ≈ 0.423.

So 1 - 0.423 = 0.577, which is about 57.7%.

But the options given are numbers 1 to 10, which don't match 0.577. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the minimum of three exponentials, but that doesn't make sense because the doorman needs three cabs, so it's the maximum, not the minimum. Wait, no, maximum would be the time when the last cab arrives. So the correct way is to model the time until the third arrival, which is the sum of three exponentials.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to compute this probability in terms of the options given, but the options are all integers, and the answer I get is about 0.577. Wait, the options are letters A-J with possible answers from 1-10 as numbers, but in the options, the numbers given are A:7, B:3, C:2, D:6, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Let me read it again.

The question says: the arrival of empty cabs has an exponential distribution with mean 2 minutes. So each cab arrives as a Poisson process with rate λ=1/2 per minute.

The doorman needs three cabs, and we want the probability that all three arrive within 6 minutes. So the time until the third arrival is less than or equal to 6.

So, using the gamma CDF approach, the answer is approximately 0.577, which is about 57.7%. But none of the options are decimals; they're all integers from 1 to 10, except for option B which is 3, and so on.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to compute the exact expression, and the options are the coefficients or exponents. Let me think: e^{-3} is about 0.0498, and 8.5 is 17/2. So 17/2 * e^{-3} is 8.5 e^{-3}.

Wait, 8.5 is 17/2. So the exact probability is 1 - (17/2) e^{-3}.

But the options don't have 17/2, but option I is 4, J is 1, etc. Hmm, I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the time for each couple to get a cab, but that's not how it's worded. The doorman needs three cabs, so it's the time until three arrivals.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the minimum of three exponentials, but that would be the time until the first cab arrives, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the maximum, but the maximum of three exponentials would give the time when the last cab arrives. So the CDF for the maximum would give P(max(T1,T2,T3) ≤6), which is the same as P(T1≤6, T2≤6, T3≤6) because all three must arrive by 6. Since the arrivals are independent, this is [P(T≤6)]^3.

Wait, wait, no. Because for each cab arrival, the time until it arrives is exponential. So the probability that a single cab arrives within 6 minutes is P(T≤6) for one exponential variable.

For one cab, P(T≤6) = 1 - e^{-(1/2)*6} = 1 - e^{-3} ≈ 0.9502.

Since the three cabs are independent, the probability that all three arrive within 6 minutes is (1 - e^{-3})^3.

Wait, that would be (approx 0.9502)^3 ≈ 0.857.

But that's about 0.857, which is about 85.7%, still not matching the options given.

Wait, but this approach would model each cab's arrival time as independent exponentials. So the probability that all three are ≤6 is the product of each being ≤6.

Hmm, but wait, the doorman is waiting for three cabs. So perhaps the correct model is the minimum of three exponentials for the first cab, then the next, etc. But I'm getting myself confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the sum of three exponentials, as I thought earlier. So the time until the third cab arrives is the sum of three exponential variables. So the CDF at t=6 is 1 - e^{-3} (1 +3 + 4.5) = 1 - 8.5 e^{-3}.

But the numerical value is around 0.577, which is about 57.7%, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let me check the possible options again. The options are:

A:7, B:3, C:2, D:6, E:9, F:5, G:10, H:8, I:4, J:1.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the probability expressed as a fraction times e^{-3}, and the coefficient is 8.5, which is 17/2. But none of the options match 17 or 8.5.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 8.5 e^{-3}.

e^{-3} is approximately 0.049787.

So 8.5 * 0.049787 ≈ 0.4227.

So 1 - 0.4227 = 0.5773.

But the options don't include this value. So perhaps the approach is wrong.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the time until three cabs arrive is modeled as a Poisson process with rate λ=1/2 per minute. The number of cabs arriving in 6 minutes is Poisson with λ=3.

But the question is about the time until three arrivals, which would be a gamma distribution. However, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the probability that at least three cabs arrive in six minutes, which is the same as the complement of 0,1, or 2 arrivals.

Wait, that's what I did earlier. So P(N≥3) =1 - P(N=0) - P(N=1) - P(N=2) = 1 - e^{-3}(1 + 3 + 4.5) = same as before.

Hmm, I'm stuck because the options don't seem to match the numerical value I'm getting. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects an exact expression in terms of e^{-3} multiplied by a coefficient, and perhaps the coefficient is 8.5, which is option H:8 or I:4, but 8.5 isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the answer in terms of the gamma function and the answer is 1 - (something), but I don't see how that would match the options given.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The question asks for the probability that all three couples are taken care of within 6 minutes. So each couple needs a cab, and each cab arrives exponentially with mean 2 minutes. Since the cabs are independent, the time until the third cab arrives is the sum of three exponentials.

The CDF for the sum is 1 - e^{-3} (1 + 3 + 4.5). So 1 - 8.5 e^{-3}.

Looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is expressed in terms of 8.5, but since the options don't have decimals, maybe it's 8 or 9. But 8.5 is closer to 8 or 9. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the exponent to be considered, like e^{-3} is about 5%, so 8.5*(5%)=42.5%, so 1-0.425=57.5%, which is close to 0.577. But again, options don't match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me recheck.

The gamma CDF for k=3, λ=1/2, t=6.

The formula is P(T ≤ t) = 1 - e^{-λ t} [1 + λ t + (λ t)^2 /2! ].

Plugging in λ=1/2, t=6: λ t =3.

So,

P(T ≤6) = 1 - e^{-3} [1 +3 + 9/2] = 1 - e^{-3} (8.5) ≈ 1 - 0.423 = 0.577.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps the answer is expressed as 1 - 8.5 e^{-3}, but none of the options match that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability in terms of the number of exponentials, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should compute the exact value of 8.5 e^{-3}.

e^{-3} = 1/(e^3) ≈ 1/20.0855 ≈ 0.049787.

So 8.5 * 0.049787 ≈ 0.4227.

Thus, 1 - 0.4227 ≈ 0.5773.

But the options don't have this number. Wait, the options are A:7, B:3, etc. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the expected number of cabs arriving in 6 minutes. The expected number is λ t =3. So E[N]=3, which is option B:3.

But the question isn't asking for the expectation; it's asking for the probability that all three couples are taken care of, i.e., at least three cabs arrive.

Wait, but the expected number is 3, which is option B. But that doesn't answer the probability question. So perhaps the intended answer is B:3.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the probability that the third cab arrives exactly at 6 minutes, but that's zero in continuous distributions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the Poisson distribution with λ=3, and the probability P(N=3) is 3^3 e^{-3}/3! = 27 e^{-3}/6 ≈ 0.224.

But that's not matching the options either.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the time until the third arrival is a gamma variable with parameters shape=3, rate=1/2.

The probability that T ≤6 is the integral from 0 to6 of the gamma PDF.

But calculating that integral exactly requires computing the incomplete gamma function, which isn't straightforward without a calculator.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using the Poisson distribution approach, and the
