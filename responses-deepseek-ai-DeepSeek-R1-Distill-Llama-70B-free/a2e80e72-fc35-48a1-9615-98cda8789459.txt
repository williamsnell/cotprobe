Question:

In 2006, an investor purchased a 100-acre tract located in a rural county. Shortly thereafter, the investor prepared a subdivision plan that created 90 one-acre residential building lots on this tract with the remaining 10-acre lot proposed for a public school building. In the investor's sales brochure promoting the subdivision, he stated that "in addition to the close proximity of the proposed school for subdivision residents, the county school district would not need to expend tax money to acquire this property for school construction. " In 2007, the subdivision plan was recorded with the county recorder's office. On January 15, 2009, the county school board voted to build a new school on the 10-acre tract. The investor's proposed designation of the 1 0-acre tract for construction of a school building would best be described as a (an)

Options:

Okay, so I've got this real estate law question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

So, the setup is that an investor bought a 100-acre tract in a rural county in 2006. Then he made a subdivision plan that divided the land into 90 one-acre lots for residential use and kept a 10-acre lot for a public school. In his sales brochure, he said that the school would be close by and that the county wouldn't have to spend tax money to buy the land. In 2007, he recorded the subdivision plan. Then in 2009, the county school board decided to build the school on that 10-acre tract.

The question is asking what the investor's designation of the 10-acre tract for the school would best be described as. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, what concepts do I remember from property law that might apply here? Let's think about the different options.

Option A: Equitable servitude. I remember that an equitable servitude is a type of covenant that can be enforced in equity, typically through injunctions. It's usually created by a written agreement, like in a deed, and it "touches and concerns" the land.

Option B: Easement for public use. An easement is a right to use someone else's land for a specific purpose. Public easements are usually created by the government, like for roads or utilities. But here, the investor is designating the land, not the government. So maybe this isn't it.

Option C: Invalid legal agreement. I'm not sure why it would be invalid. The investor recorded the plan, so perhaps it's a valid agreement. I need more info here.

Option D: Implied easement. Implied easements usually arise when there's a necessity or previous use, like a driveway that was used before the property was divided. That doesn't seem to fit here since the investor is actively designating the land for a school, not implying an existing use.

Option E: Adverse possession. That's when someone takes possession of land without the owner's permission and gains title after a certain period. Not relevant here.

Option F: Restrictive covenant. These are agreements that restrict the use of land, like in a subdivision where all houses must be a certain size. But in this case, the investor is designating land for a specific use (a school) rather than restricting use. So maybe not a restrictive covenant.

Option G: Real estate lien. A lien is a claim against property for a debt. Doesn't seem relevant here.

Option H: Unenforceable restriction. If the investor tried to impose some kind of restriction without proper legal basis, maybe it's unenforceable. But I'm not sure yet.

Option I: Right of way easement. This is a type of easement that gives someone the right to travel over another's land. Not directly related to building a school.

Option J: Zoning regulation. Zoning is a government-imposed regulation on land use. Here, it's the investor who is designating the land use, not the government, so this might not be it.

So, going back to the scenario. The investor included the 10-acre lot for a school in his subdivision plan and promoted it in the brochure. When he recorded the subdivision plan, that's a public record that likely includes the dedication of that land for the school. 

Wait, when a developer records a subdivision plan, sometimes there are dedications for public uses, like parks or schools. This is often done through an offer to dedicate the land to public use, which the public entity (like the school board) can accept. 

So, in this case, the investor has offered the 10-acre tract for the school. By recording the subdivision plan, he's dedicating that land for public use. The school board then accepted it in 2009 when they voted to build the school. 

So, what's the legal term for this dedication? It's not an easement because an easement is a right to use, but here the land is being given for the purpose of building. It's more like a dedication. 

Wait, but the options don't have "dedication." So I have to see which of the given options fits best. 

An equitable servitude might apply if there's a covenant that the land will be used for a certain purpose. But in this case, the investor is offering the land to the public entity, so it's more about dedicating it rather than a covenant that restricts use.

Alternatively, think about whether this creates an easement. But an easement for public use is usually for things like roads or utilities, and it's a right, not an ownership transfer. The investor is setting aside the land for the school, which would likely involve transferring ownership or granting a right to use it for that specific purpose.

Wait, perhaps the investor's action is creating an offer of dedication. Once the subdivision plan is recorded, the public entity (school board) can accept it, making it a public easement or dedication. So in this case, the investor's action would be an offer to dedicate the land for public use as a school, which the school board accepted later.

So the designation in the subdivision plan would be an easement for public use, which would be option B.

But earlier I thought option B was about public easements, which are usually created by the government. But here, the investor is offering it, so perhaps it's a public easement once accepted.

Alternatively, could it be an equitable servitude? Because the investor is imposing a restriction that the land will be used as a school, but that's for the public benefit, not just for neighboring landowners.

Wait, no, because an equitable servitude typically benefits the neighbors, like in a subdivision where all lots must have houses of a certain size. Here, the benefit is for the public, so it's more of a dedication than a servitude.

So perhaps the correct answer is B: easement for public use.

Another thought: when the subdivision plan is recorded, it's a way of dedicating land for public purposes. The investor is, in effect, offering the land for public use, which the school board accepted. So that would create an easement for public use, making option B correct.

Alternatively, since it's a dedication, maybe it's not an easement but a fee simple transfer. But the question isn't about the transfer of ownership; it's about the designation. So when the investor recorded the plan, he was dedicating the land for the school, which would be an easement or a dedication.

Wait, but an easement doesn't transfer ownership; it's a right to use the land. If the school is built on the land, the school district would likely own it, so maybe it's a dedication of the fee simple title. But the question is about the designation, not the transfer.

So perhaps the best fit is an easement for public use because the investor is allowing the public (school) to use the land for a specific purpose. So option B.

Wait, but another angle: in some cases, when a developer dedicates land for public use in a subdivision, it's considered a public dedication, which creates an easement in favor of the public. So yes, option B fits.

So the answer should be B.

The investor purchased a 100-acre tract and created a subdivision plan designating 90 acres for residential lots and 10 acres for a public school. The plan was recorded in 2007, and the school board accepted the designation by voting to build the school in 2009. The question asks for the best legal description of the investor's designation of the 10-acre tract.

Analyzing the options:

- **Equitable Servitude (A):** Typically involves a covenant restricting land use for the benefit of neighboring landowners, not the public. This does not fit the scenario.
- **Easement for Public Use (B):** An easement allows a specific use of land. By recording the subdivision plan and designating the 10-acre tract for a school, the investor effectively offered the land for public use, which the school board accepted. This aligns with the concept of an easement for public use.
- **Invalid Legal Agreement (C):** There is no indication the agreement was invalid; the subdivision plan was recorded, and the school board accepted the designation.
- **Implied Easement (D):** Implied easements arise from necessity or prior use, which is not applicable here.
- **Adverse Possession (E):** Irrelevant, as this involves unauthorized possession, not a voluntary designation.
- **Restrictive Covenant (F):** Restricts land use but does not apply here, as the investor is designating land for a specific public use.
- **Real Estate Lien (G):** Unrelated, as liens involve debt claims.
- **Unenforceable Restriction (H):** The designation was enforceable, as the school board accepted it.
- **Right of Way Easement (I):** Specific to travel over land, not applicable to building a school.
- **Zoning Regulation (J):** Zoning is government-imposed, whereas the investor voluntarily designated the land.

The investor's action of designating the 10-acre tract for a school in the recorded subdivision plan constitutes an offer to dedicate the land for public use, which the school board accepted. This is best described as an **easement for public use**.

Answer: B
