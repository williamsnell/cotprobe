Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out which option is the best buy. The question is about bars of soap and their prices. I'm a bit confused about how to approach this, but I think I can work through it step by step.

First, I remember that when comparing prices, the best buy is usually the one with the lowest cost per unit. In this case, the unit is one bar of soap. So I need to calculate the cost per bar for each option and then see which one is the cheapest.

Let me list out all the options again to make sure I don't miss any:

A: 17 bars for $38.72
B: 16 bars for $36.48
C: 12 bars for $27.60
D: 20 bars for $45.00
E: 11 bars for $25.08
F: 10 bars for $23.20
G: 15 bars for $34.50
H: 18 bars for $40.68
I: 14 bars for $31.92
J: 13 bars for $29.51

Alright, so for each option, I'll divide the total cost by the number of bars to get the price per bar.

Starting with option A: $38.72 / 17 bars. Hmm, let's do the math. 38.72 divided by 17. Well, 17 times 2 is 34, so 2 dollars per bar would be 34. Subtract that from 38.72, which leaves 4.72. Then 4.72 divided by 17 is about 0.277. So total is approximately $2.277 per bar.

Option B: $36.48 / 16. Hmm, 36 divided by 16 is 2.25, and 0.48/16 is 0.03, so total is $2.28 per bar. Wait, wait, let me calculate that again. 16 times 2 is 32, subtract 32 from 36.48, you get 4.48. 4.48 divided by 16 is 0.28. So 2.28 per bar. So A is a bit cheaper than B.

Option C: $27.60 / 12. Well, 27 divided by 12 is 2.25, and 0.60/12 is 0.05, so total is $2.30 per bar. So a bit more expensive than A and B.

Option D: $45.00 /20. 45 divided by 20 is 2.25, because 20*2 is 40, and 5 left, which is 0.25. So $2.25 per bar. That's cheaper than A, B, and C so far.

Option E: $25.08 /11. Let's see, 25/11 is about 2.2727, and 0.08/11 is approx 0.00727. So total is about 2.28 per bar. So cheaper than some but more expensive than D.

Option F: $23.20 /10. That's 23.20 divided by 10, which is $2.32 per bar. So more than D.

Option G: $34.50 /15. 34.50 divided by 15. 15 times 2 is 30, subtract that from 34.50 leaves 4.50. 4.50/15 is 0.30. So total is $2.30 per bar. So higher than D.

Option H: $40.68 /18. Let's do this. 40 divided by 18 is about 2.222, and 0.68/18 is approximately 0.0378. So total is around 2.26 per bar. That's cheaper than A, B, C, etc., but more than D.

Wait, D is $2.25, which is cheaper than H's 2.26.

Option I: $31.92 /14. Let's calculate. 31.92 divided by 14. 14 times 2 is 28, subtract that from 31.92, leaves 3.92. 3.92 divided by 14 is approximately 0.28. So total is 2.28 per bar.

Option J: $29.51 /13. 29 divided by 13 is 2.2308, and 0.51/13 is about 0.0392. So total is approximately 2.269 per bar.

So putting it all together, the per bar prices are approximately:

A: ~2.277
B: 2.28
C: 2.30
D: 2.25
E: ~2.28
F: 2.32
G: 2.30
H: ~2.26
I: 2.28
J: ~2.269

So the cheapest is D at $2.25 per bar. No, wait, let me double-check. D is $45 for 20 bars: 45/20=2.25. That's correct.

Wait, but looking again, option H is 18 bars for $40.68. 40.68/18: let me do that more accurately. 18*2=36, 40.68-36=4.68. 4.68/18=0.26. So 2.26 per bar. So D is cheaper than H.

So D is the cheapest so far, but wait—did I miss any other options that might be cheaper? Let me check option F again. F is 10 bars for $23.20. 23.20/10=2.32, which is more than D.

Another way to check: perhaps any of the other options have a lower per-unit cost. Let me recheck option E: 11 bars for $25.08. 25.08/11 is approximately 2.2809.

So D seems to have the lowest per-bar cost at $2.25.

Wait, but what about option F? It's 10 bars for $23.20. 23.20/10=2.32, yes, which is higher than D.

So the best buy is option D: 20 bars for $45.00, which is $2.25 per bar.

To determine the best buy, we calculate the cost per bar of soap for each option by dividing the total cost by the number of bars. The option with the lowest cost per bar is the best buy. Here are the calculations:

- **A**: $38.72 / 17 ≈ $2.277 per bar  
- **B**: $36.48 / 16 = $2.28 per bar  
- **C**: $27.60 / 12 = $2.30 per bar  
- **D**: $45.00 / 20 = $2.25 per bar  
- **E**: $25.08 / 11 ≈ $2.2809 per bar  
- **F**: $23.20 / 10 = $2.32 per bar  
- **G**: $34.50 / 15 = $2.30 per bar  
- **H**: $40.68 / 18 ≈ $2.26 per bar  
- **I**: $31.92 / 14 ≈ $2.28 per bar  
- **J**: $29.51 / 13 ≈ $2.269 per bar  

The lowest cost per bar is **$2.25**, which corresponds to **Option D**: 20 bars for $45.00.
