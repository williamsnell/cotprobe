Question:

A housing corporation owned a tract of land and prepared a development plan to divide the land into 100 lots and create a residential community on the property. The Declaration of Covenants created the community association, an administrative entity that would administer and enforce the regulations' and restrictions recited in the Declaration of Covenants. One of the restrictions reads:"There shall never at any time be erected, permitted, or maintained upon any part of the property any structure designed for or used as a saloon or place for the sale or manufacture of malt, vinous, or spirituous liquors. "The Declaration of Covenants was duly recorded and was included in the deed taken by a psychologist when he purchased lot 24 in the housing development. The psychologist recorded his deed. The psychologist gave his lot to his son. The deed conveying lot 24 to the son contained no reference to the Declaration of Covenants or any of its provisions. The deed provided that "these premises are conveyed to (the son), his heirs, and assigns, as long as they are used for residential purposes only. " The son did not record his deed. The son was unaware of the Declaration of Covenants. The son started a home business selling imported wine from his home. A geologist, the owner of lot 26, which was situated next to the son's lot, brought an action of ejectment against the son. Which of the following is the best argument for the son?

Options:

A: Not having been recorded, the condition cannot be enforced against the son.
B: The son's business does not qualify as a saloon or place for manufacture of liquors.
C: The law prohibits a fee simple determinable.
D: The deed to the son created a fee simple determinable with a possibility of reverter, giving the psychologist, but not the geologist, the right to sue the son.
E: The geologist is entitled only to an injunction against the son.
F: The son was not aware of the Declaration of Covenants, thus should not be held accountable.
G: The psychologist did not explicitly forbid the sale of alcohol in the deed to the son.
H: The geologist has no right to sue as the son's business does not affect him directly.
I: The prohibition in the Declaration of Covenants does not apply as the son did not purchase the lot.

Okay, so I have this legal question to tackle, and I need to figure out the best answer. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the scenario: A housing corporation has a tract of land divided into 100 lots. They created a Declaration of Covenants, which set up a community association to enforce certain restrictions. One of these restrictions prohibits any structure used as a saloon or for the sale or manufacture of liquor. 

The psychologist bought lot 24, and his deed included the Declaration of Covenants, which was also recorded. Later, he gave the lot to his son via a deed that didn't mention the Declaration. The son's deed says the premises are conveyed for residential use only. The son didn't record his deed and didn't know about the Declaration. Then the son started selling imported wine from home. A geologist from lot 26 is suing him for ejectment.

Now, the question is about the best argument the son can make. The options are A to I.

I think I should start by understanding the key legal concepts here. This seems to involve property law, specifically covenants, conditions, and restrictions. So, the main issues are whether the son is bound by the Declaration of Covenants and whether the geologist has the right to sue.

First, the Declaration of Covenants was recorded by the housing corporation. When the psychologist bought lot 24, the deed included it, and he recorded the deed. So the psychologist was bound by the covenants. When he conveyed the lot to his son, the deed didn't mention the covenants, but the son's deed had a condition that the premises are used for residential purposes only.

But wait, the son didn't record his deed. I remember that recording provides notice to others and is important for enforceability against subsequent purchasers. But does the son's failure to record affect the enforceability against him? Or does it affect the geologist's ability to enforce the covenant?

But here, the Declaration of Covenants was already recorded by the corporation. So when the psychologist bought the lot, he was bound by it. When he transferred to the son, the son's deed didn't mention the covenants, but does that matter? Because covenants typically run with the land, meaning they bind subsequent owners, provided certain conditions are met.

Wait, but the son's deed had its own condition: use for residential purposes only. So the psychologist included that. But the original covenant was broader, prohibiting sale of liquor. 

So, the first thing is whether the son is bound by the Declaration of Covenants. For a covenant to run with the land, it must meet the requirements of horizontal privity (original parties must have some current property interest) and vertical privity (succession of interest). Also, the covenant must "touch and concern" the land.

In this case, the original covenant was in the Declaration, which was recorded. The psychologist was bound, and when he sold to the son, the son took the land. So the covenant should run with the land to the son, provided it was properly recorded and the son had notice or it's enforceable through the recording.

But the son didn't record his deed. However, recording isn't about the covenant's enforceability against him; it's more about whether others have notice. But since the original covenant was already recorded, the son is bound if he had constructive notice. Because when the son took the deed, even if his deed didn't mention it, the original recorded covenant would still affect him because it's part of the property records. So he's bound by it regardless of his knowledge, because the covenant was properly recorded.

So the son might argue that he didn't know, but that's probably not a valid argument because the covenant was recorded, so he's deemed to have constructive notice.

Now, looking at the options. 

Option A says the condition can't be enforced because not recorded. But the condition in the son's deed is about residential use, but the original covenant was already recorded. So maybe A isn't the right approach. Alternatively, the condition in the son's deed is a separate issue.

Option B says the son's business isn't a saloon or place for manufacturing. The son is selling wine from home, not a commercial establishment. So maybe it's not a saloon. That could be a possible defense.

Option C says the law prohibits a fee simple determinable. The son's deed says "as long as used for residential purposes only." That creates a fee simple determinable with a possibility of reverter. But is that enforceable? I think fee simple determinables are allowed, so C might not be correct.

Option D argues that the deed to the son created a fee simple determinable, giving the psychologist the right to sue, not the geologist. Because the geologist is a neighboring lot owner, perhaps he can't enforce the covenant. Wait, the Declaration of Covenants is a common scheme, so all lot owners in the development are bound and can enforce. But the son's deed's condition is a separate issue. So if the condition is enforceable by the psychologist, but the geologist is suing under the Declaration. So D might be a good argument because the geologist's right to enforce the Declaration's covenant might not exist, but in reality, in a common scheme, all owners can enforce.

Option E says the geologist is entitled only to an injunction, not ejectment. Ejectment is for possession, so maybe the geologist can't get that, but can get an injunction. But I'm not sure if that's the best argument here.

Option F is about the son's lack of awareness. But as I thought earlier, the covenant was recorded, so he's bound regardless. So F is not a good argument.

Option G says the psychologist didn't forbid alcohol. But the psychologist's deed included the Declaration, which did forbid it. So G doesn't hold.

Option H says the geologist can't sue because not directly affected. But in a common scheme, any owner can enforce the covenants, regardless of direct impact. So H might not be correct.

Option I says the prohibition doesn't apply because the son didn't purchase the lot. But the son owns the lot now, so I is incorrect.

So, reviewing the options, the best arguments seem to be B and D.

The son's business is selling wine from home. Does that qualify as a saloon or place for sale? A saloon is a place where liquor is sold and consumed on the premises. If the son is just selling wine for off-site consumption, maybe it's not a saloon. The covenant prohibits use as a saloon or for sale or manufacture. So selling from home might fall under "sale," but maybe not. It's a bit ambiguous. So B could be a good argument if the business isn't considered a saloon or a place for sale in the sense intended by the covenant.

Option D's argument is about who has the right to enforce. The son's deed condition (residential use) is a fee simple determinable, giving the right of reverter to the psychologist. So if the son violates this, the psychologist can take back the property. But the geologist is suing under the Declaration's covenant, not the son's deed. So the geologist, as a neighboring lot owner, may have standing to enforce the covenant because it's part of the common scheme. So D's argument might not hold because the geologist can enforce the covenant regardless of the son's deed condition.

Alternatively, if the condition in the son's deed is separate, perhaps the geologist can't enforce that, but can enforce the Declaration's covenant. So the son's best argument is B: that his business doesn't violate the covenant because it's not a saloon or a place for sale as defined.

Wait, but the covenant says "sale or manufacture of malt, vinous, or spirituous liquors." Selling wine from home would fall under sale. So maybe B isn't a good defense. Unless the sale is considered a home occupation that's allowed, but the covenant outright prohibits any sale. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the covenant is considered a restrictive covenant, and the son's use violates it. So the geologist can enforce. Then the son's best defense is that his use doesn't violate the covenant. 

Alternatively, the son's deed created a fee simple determinable, but that's a separate issue. The Declaration's covenant is a separate restrictive covenant. So the geologist can still enforce the covenant regardless of the son's deed's condition.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The Declaration of Covenants is a common scheme, so all lot owners are bound by it. The psychologist's deed included it, and it was recorded. The son, as a subsequent owner, is bound by it because it's a covenant that runs with the land. So the son's business likely violates the covenant.

But the son's deed from the psychologist says the premises are conveyed as long as used for residential purposes only. That's a condition subsequent or determinable? The wording "as long as" usually creates a fee simple determinable, with a possibility of reverter. So if the condition is violated, the estate automatically reverts to the grantor (psychologist). But that's a separate issue from the Declaration's covenant.

So the geologist is suing under the Declaration's covenant, not under the son's deed condition. Therefore, the son's best argument would be that he's not violating the covenant, perhaps under option B, or that the geologist can't enforce it because only the psychologist can under the deed's condition, but I think that's not the case because the Declaration allows any lot owner to enforce.

Wait, but the Declaration's covenant is a separate enforceable covenant. So the geologist can sue to enforce it, regardless of the son's deed's condition. So the son's best argument is that his business doesn't violate the covenant (option B), or perhaps that the geologist can't enforce it (option H), but I don't think H is correct.

Alternatively, if the son's use is considered a home occupation that's permissible under the covenant, but the covenant explicitly prohibits any sale. So perhaps B is the best argument, but I'm not sure.

Another angle: the son's deed's condition is for residential use only. If the son is using it for a business, that might violate this condition, giving the psychologist the right to revoke. But the geologist is suing under the Declaration's covenant, not the son's deed. So the son could argue that the geologist can't enforce the condition in the son's deed, but the geologist is enforcing the Declaration, which is a separate matter.

So perhaps the best argument is option D: the son's deed created a fee simple determinable, giving the psychologist the right to sue, not the geologist. But wait, the geologist is suing under the Declaration, not the son's deed. So the geologist's right to sue is based on the Declaration's covenant, which is separate. Therefore, D's argument might not apply because the geologist isn't relying on the son's deed condition.

So perhaps the best argument is B, but if the business is selling wine, that's a sale, which is prohibited. So maybe B isn't a good defense.

Alternatively, the son could argue that the condition in his deed (residential use) is the only restriction he's bound by, and the Declaration doesn't apply because it wasn't mentioned in his deed. But that's not correct because the Declaration was recorded and runs with the land, so the son is bound regardless of his deed mentioning it.

Wait, but the son's deed didn't mention the Declaration. However, since the Declaration was recorded before the psychologist's purchase, and the psychologist's deed included it, the son, as a subsequent purchaser, is still bound by the Declaration's covenants because they run with the land. So the son can't avoid it just because his deed didn't mention it.

So, back to the options. The best possible arguments would be either B or D.

If the son's business doesn't qualify, then B is good. But if the business does qualify, then perhaps D is better.

Wait, but the son's deed condition is a separate issue. The geologist is suing based on the Declaration's covenant. So the son can't avoid that. So perhaps the best defense is that the geologist can't enforce the covenant because only the psychologist can, based on the son's deed's condition. But that doesn't make sense because the Declaration's covenant is a separate enforceable right for all lot owners.

Hmm, this is tricky. I think I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, another point: when the psychologist conveyed the lot to the son, the deed's condition (residential only) might have created a new servitude. But the original Declaration's covenant is a separate servitude. So the son is bound by both, assuming they're enforceable.

But the son's business violates both. So the geologist can sue under the Declaration. The psychologist could sue under the son's deed condition.

So the son's best argument is that the geologist can't enforce the Declaration's covenant. But in a common scheme, any owner can enforce. So perhaps the son's best argument is that his use doesn't violate the covenant, i.e., option B.

Alternatively, if the son didn't record his deed, does that affect the geologist's ability to enforce? But the Declaration was already recorded, so the geologist has constructive notice, and the son is bound regardless. So option A is not correct.

I think the best answer is B: the son's business doesn't qualify as a saloon or place for sale. But wait, the covenant prohibits any structure used for sale. So selling from home would be a use, not a structure. Or does the covenant prohibit the activity regardless of the structure? The wording is "any structure designed for or used as a saloon or place for the sale..." So if the son is using his home (a structure) for sale, that would violate it. So B might not hold.

Alternatively, maybe the son's use is a home occupation that's allowed, but the covenant prohibits it outright. So perhaps B isn't a good defense.

Wait, perhaps D is better. The son's deed condition is a fee simple determinable, giving the psychologist the right to reverter. So if the son violates the condition (non-residential use), the psychologist can take action, but the geologist can't because he's not the grantor. So the geologist can't enforce the condition in the son's deed. But the geologist is suing under the Declaration, not the deed condition. So D's argument doesn't prevent the geologist from suing under the Declaration.

So I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to outline each option again.

Option D: The son's deed created a fee simple determinable with a possibility of reverter, giving the psychologist the right to sue, not the geologist.

So the argument is that only the psychologist can enforce the condition in the son's deed. But the geologist is suing under the Declaration, which is a separate covenant. Therefore, D's argument doesn't prevent the geologist from suing. So D might not be the best argument.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition in the son's deed supersedes the Declaration's covenant. But I don't think so because the Declaration's covenant is a separate servitude that runs with the land.

So, perhaps the best argument is B: that the son's business isn't a saloon or place for sale as defined. But I'm not sure if that's accurate because selling wine from home could be seen as a place for sale.

Wait, the covenant says "any structure designed for or used as a saloon or place for the sale..." So the structure (the house) is being used for sale. So it's violating the covenant. Therefore, B might not be a good defense.

Wait, but a home-based business might be allowed if it's incidental. But the covenant seems absolute, so any sale is prohibited. So B might not work.

So perhaps the best argument is that the geologist can't enforce because only the psychologist can under the son's deed, but that's not correct because the Declaration's covenant is enforceable by any lot owner.

Alternatively, the son's failure to record his deed might affect the geologist's claim. But the Declaration was recorded, so the geologist has standing regardless.

Wait, another thought: the condition in the son's deed is a servitude. The psychologist, as the grantor, can enforce it. But the Declaration's covenant is a separate servitude that the geologist can enforce as a beneficiary. So the son is bound by both. Therefore, the geologist can sue under the Declaration, and the psychologist can sue under the deed condition.

So the son's best argument is that his business doesn't violate the Declaration's covenant (option B), but I think it does, so B might not be a good option.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition in the son's deed (residential only) is a separate restriction, and the Declaration's covenant is another. So the son is violating both. But the geologist can only enforce the Declaration's covenant, not the son's deed condition. So the son's best argument is that the geologist can't enforce the deed condition, but that's not what the geologist is suing under.

Wait, the geologist is suing under the Declaration's covenant, not the son's deed condition. So the son's best argument is that the business doesn't violate the covenant (option B), but I think it does. So perhaps the best argument is that the geologist can't enforce because the son's deed condition is the only restriction, but that's not the case.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to pick the best option.

Option D: The deed to the son created a fee simple determinable, giving the psychologist, not the geologist, the right to sue. So the geologist can't enforce the condition in the son's deed. But the geologist is enforcing the Declaration's covenant, which is separate. So D's argument doesn't apply.

Option B: The business isn't a saloon or place for sale. It's a home business selling wine. Maybe the court would interpret the covenant as not intending to prohibit home-based businesses unless they're commercial establishments. So B could be a possible defense.

Alternatively, the covenant is clear: any sale is prohibited. So B is not a good defense.

Hmm. I think the best option is D. Because the son's deed condition is enforceable only by the psychologist, and the geologist can't enforce it. But the geologist is suing under the Declaration, not the deed. So D's argument is not applicable. Therefore, perhaps the best answer is B.

Wait, but if the covenant prohibits any sale, then B is not a valid defense.

I'm getting really stuck here. Let me try to think of what each option is saying.

Option D says that the son's deed created a fee simple determinable, giving the psychologist the right to sue, but not the geologist. So the argument is that the geologist can't enforce the condition in the son's deed. But the geologist is suing under the Declaration, not the son's deed. So D's argument doesn't prevent the geologist from suing under the Declaration.

Therefore, the son's best argument is that his business doesn't violate the Declaration's covenant, which is option B. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, the son could argue that the condition in his deed (res
