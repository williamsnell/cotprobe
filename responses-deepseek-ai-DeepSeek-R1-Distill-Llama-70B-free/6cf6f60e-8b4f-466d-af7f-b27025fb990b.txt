Okay, so I have this problem about radioactivity and curies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question is about finding out how many grains of astatine equal one curie. Wait, wait, grains? Oh, I think they mean grams. Or maybe they're using grain as a unit here. Let me read the question again.

Oh wait, the question says "how many grains of astatine would equal one curie." Hmm, grains? That's confusing. Grain is a unit of mass, I think. One grain is about 64.8 milligrams or 0.0648 grams. But wait, the options are all in grams, not grains. So maybe that's a typo, and they meant grams. Or perhaps it's a trick, but I'm not sure. Maybe the question has a typo, but I'll proceed assuming it's grams.

So, the problem states that one curie is the amount of material equivalent to one gram of radium, giving 3.7e10 disintegrations per second. Oh right, I remember that 1 Ci is 3.7e10 decays per second. So, the activity is 3.7e10 Bq, since 1 Bq is 1 decay per second.

The element in question is ^210At, which has a half-life of 8.3 hours. I need to find the mass in grams that would have an activity of one curie.

Okay, so activity (A) is given by the formula A = λ * N, where λ is the decay constant and N is the number of atoms.

First, I need to find λ. The decay constant is related to the half-life (t₁/₂) by λ = ln(2) / t₁/₂.

Wait, the half-life here is 8.3 hours, but I should convert that into seconds because the standard unit for λ is per second. So 8.3 hours * 60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute = let me calculate that.

8.3 * 60 = 498 minutes, then 498 * 60 = 29880 seconds.

So λ = 0.6931 / 29880 ≈ let's compute that. 0.6931 divided by 29880. Let me do that division.

29880 is roughly 3e4. 0.6931/3e4 = approx 2.31e-5 per second.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 0.6931 / 29880.

Let me compute 29880:

29880 = 2.988e4.

0.6931 / 2.988e4 = approximately 2.317e-5 s⁻¹.

Wait, let me do precise calculation:

0.6931 ÷ 29880 = ?

Let me compute 29880 × 2.317e-5 = 0.6931?

Wait, 29880 * 2.317e-5 = 29880 * 0.00002317.

Multiply 29880 by 0.00002317:

29880 * 0.00002 is 0.596.

29880 * 0.00000317 is approximately 0.0946. So total is 0.6906, which is close to 0.6931. So λ is approximately 2.317e-5 s⁻¹.

Now, I need to find N, the number of atoms required to have an activity of 3.7e10 decays per second.

So A = λ*N → N = A / λ.

N = 3.7e10 / 2.317e-5.

Let me compute that. 3.7e10 / 2.317e-5 = (3.7 / 2.317) * 1e15.

3.7 / 2.317 is about 1.595. So 1.595e15 atoms.

Now, I need to find the mass of these atoms in grams.

To find the mass, I can use Avogadro's number. The molar mass of At is needed. What's the atomic weight of astatine? I think it's around 210, since it's ^210At. So molar mass is approximately 210 g/mol.

So the number of moles (n) is N / Avogadro's number. Avogadro's number is 6.022e23 atoms/mol.

n = 1.595e15 / 6.022e23 ≈ 2.65e-9 mol.

Mass is moles multiplied by molar mass, so mass = 2.65e-9 mol * 210 g/mol = 5.565e-7 grams.

Wait, let me recalculate that.

Wait, 1.595e15 / 6.022e23 = (1.595 / 6.022) * 1e-8.

1.595 /6.022 is approximately 0.265. So 0.265e-8 mol → 2.65e-9 mol.

Multiply by 210 g/mol: 2.65e-9 * 210 = 5.565e-7 grams.

Looking at the options, option D is 7.71e-7, E is 3.3e-7, J is 6.4e-7, and others.

Wait, but I got about 5.56e-7 g. Hmm, that's not matching any options exactly. Did I make a mistake?

Let me double-check the calculations step by step.

First, half-life t₁/₂ =8.3 hours. Convert to seconds: 8.3 * 3600 = ?

8 * 3600 = 28800, 0.3 * 3600=1080 → 29880 seconds. Correct.

λ = ln(2)/t₁/₂ = 0.6931 / 29880 = approx 2.317e-5 s⁻¹. Correct.

Activity A =3.7e10 Bq.

N = A / λ → 3.7e10 / 2.317e-5 = 3.7e10 / 2.317e-5 = (3.7 / 2.317) * 1e15.

3.7 / 2.317 → let me compute that more accurately.

2.317 × 1.595 = 2.317 *1.5=3.4755 → 1.595 × 2.317: 1.5*2.317=3.4755, 0.095*2.317≈0.220. So total 3.4755 +0.220=3.6955. Close to 3.7. So 3.7/2.317 is about 1.595.

So N=1.595e15 atoms.

Then, moles n = N / Avogadro → 1.595e15 /6.022e23.

Let me compute 1.595e15 /6.022e23 = (1.595 / 6.022) * 1e(15-23) → (0.2648) * 1e-8 → 2.648e-9 mol.

Mass = n * molar mass → 2.648e-9 mol * 210 g/mol = ?

2.648e-9 * 210 = 2.648 *210 = 555.48 → 555.48e-9 g → 5.5548e-7 g.

So around 5.55e-7 grams. But looking at the options, I don't see this exact number. Wait, options are:

A: 1.1e-6
B:4.2e-7
C:9.8e-7
D:7.71e-7
E:3.3e-7
F:5.5e-7
G:8.2e-7
H:7.0e-7
I:2.8e-6
J:6.4e-7

Oh wait, option F is 5.5e-7 grams. So that's what I got.

But wait, wait a second. Let me check the initial problem again. Because the question says "grains", but the options are all in grams. Did I misunderstand the unit?

Wait, grains are a unit of mass, 1 grain is 0.0648 grams. So if the question is asking for grains, then the mass in grams would be divided by 0.0648 to get grains. But that complicates things more and the options are in grams. So perhaps the question has a typo, and it's grams, not grains.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait another thought: Could it be that I should have used the specific activity formula, perhaps involving molar activity?

Wait, another approach: Specific activity is the activity per mole. So the molar activity is A = λ * N_A → but wait, that's not quite right. Wait, the specific activity (A_sp) is the activity per amount of substance, so A_sp = λ * N_A.

Wait, let's correct that: The specific activity (activity per mole) is λ multiplied by Avogadro's number.

Wait, no, the specific activity is the activity per gram or per mole. Let me think.

Wait, the formula is A = λ * N. N is number of atoms, which is n * N_A, where n is moles. So A = λ * n * N_A → So n = A / (λ N_A).

Ah, so that's the same as before. So the number of moles is A/(λ N_A).

Which is what I did. Let me recalculate that.

n = (3.7e10) / (2.317e-5 * 6.022e23)

Compute denominator: 2.317e-5 * 6.022e23 = 2.317 *6.022e18 = approx 13.96e18 → 1.396e19.

So denominator is 1.396e19.

n = 3.7e10 / 1.396e19 = (3.7 /1.396 )e(10-19) → 2.65e-9 mol.

Same as before. So mass is 2.65e-9 * 210 =5.55e-7 grams.

So the correct answer should be F:5.5e-7 grams.

Wait, but let me check if I've made any mistake with the initial data. Oh, wait, the problem says "one curie is the amount ... equivalent to one gram of radium." So, is the curie defined based on radium's activity? Because radium has a longer half-life, but in this problem, we're dealing with astatine. So I think the approach is correct because we're given ^210At's half-life, so the calculation is about astatine.

Wait, but another point: Did I mix up the decay constant formula? Oh wait, the decay constant is correct, λ = ln2 / t_half.

Another thing: Let me recheck the calculation of N.

Wait, N = A / λ → 3.7e10 / 2.317e-5 = ?

3.7e10 divided by 2.317e-5 equals 3.7e10 / 2.317e-5 = (3.7 / 2.317) * 1e15 → 1.595 * 1e15 ≈1.595e15 atoms.

Yes, correct.

Wait, another angle: perhaps I should have used the molar mass more accurately. The exact atomic weight of ^210At is 209.98, which is about 210 g/mol, so that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step with the calculation of λ. Let me recompute that:

t_half =8.3 hours =8.3 *3600 =29880 seconds.

λ = ln(2)/t_half = 0.69314718056 / 29880 ≈ let me compute this exactly.

Compute 0.69314718056 ÷ 29880.

Let me do this division.

29880 is 2.988e4.

0.69314718056 / 2.988e4 = ?

Let me compute 0.69314718056 ÷ 29880.

Let me write it as 0.69314718056 ÷ 29880 ≈ 2.32e-5.

Wait, let me do this division step by step.

29880 × 2.3e-5 = 29880 * 0.000023 = 0.68784.

Which is close to 0.693147, so 2.3e-5 gives 0.68784, which is a little less than 0.693147. The difference is 0.693147 -0.68784=0.005307.

How much more do I need? Let me compute 29880 * x =0.005307.

x=0.005307 /29880 ≈ 1.776e-7.

So total λ is approximately 2.3e-5 +1.776e-7 =2.31776e-5 s⁻¹.

Which is what I had before, approximately 2.317e-5.

So no error there.

Hmm, okay, so the calculation seems correct, leading to 5.55e-7 grams, which is option F.

Wait, but looking again, the options are:

F:5.5 × 10^-7 g.

Yes, that's the one. So the correct answer is F.

But wait, the initial problem statement says "grains of astatine". If the options are in grams, perhaps it's a typo. So I think I didn't make a mistake, and the correct answer is F.
</think>

To determine how many grams of astatine (^210At) would equal one curie, we start by noting that 1 curie corresponds to an activity of \( 3.7 \times 10^{10} \, \text{decays/second} \). The half-life of ^210At is given as \( t_{1/2} = 8.3 \, \text{hours} \), which is converted to seconds:

\[
t_{1/2} = 8.3 \times 3600 = 29880 \, \text{seconds}.
\]

The decay constant \( \lambda \) is calculated using the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} = \frac{0.693}{29880} \approx 2.317 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{s}^{-1}.
\]

The activity \( A \) is related to the number of atoms \( N \) by \( A = \lambda N \). Rearranging for \( N \):

\[
N = \frac{A}{\lambda} = \frac{3.7 \times 10^{10}}{2.317 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 1.595 \times 10^{15} \, \text{atoms}.
\]

Next, the number of moles \( n \) is determined using Avogadro's number \( N_A = 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{atoms/mol} \):

\[
n = \frac{N}{N_A} = \frac{1.595 \times 10^{15}}{6.022 \times 10^{23}} \approx 2.65 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{mol}.
\]

The molar mass of ^210At is approximately \( 210 \, \text{g/mol} \). The mass \( m \) in grams is then:

\[
m = n \times \text{molar mass} = 2.65 \times 10^{-9} \times 210 \approx 5.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{g}.
\]

Comparing this result to the provided options, the closest match is:

**F: \( 5.5 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{g} \).**

Thus, the correct answer is:

**F**
