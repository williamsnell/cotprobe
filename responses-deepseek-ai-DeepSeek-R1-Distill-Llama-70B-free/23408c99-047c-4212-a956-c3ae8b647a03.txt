Okay, so I have this differential equation problem here about a vibrating system. The equation given is u'' + γ u' + u = 0. I need to find the damping coefficient γ such that the quasi period of the damped motion is 50% greater than the period of the undamped system. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when dealing with second-order linear differential equations like this, especially in the context of vibrations, it's a damped harmonic oscillator problem. The general form is u'' + 2β u' + ω² u = 0, where β is the damping coefficient and ω is the natural frequency. Wait, but in the given equation, the coefficients are γ for u' and 1 for u. So I think I need to compare the standard form with the given equation.

So in the standard form, it's u'' + 2β u' + ω₀² u = 0. Comparing this with the given equation u'' + γ u' + u = 0, I can equate the terms. That would mean 2β equals γ, so β is γ/2. Also, the coefficient of u is ω₀², which is 1 in this case. So ω₀ is sqrt(1) which is 1. Got it.

Now, the problem is about the quasi-period in the case of underdamped motion. Wait, because if the system is overdamped, it doesn't oscillate, so the quasi-period only exists when it's underdamped. So I need to make sure that γ is less than 2ω₀, which in this case would be 2*1=2. So as long as γ is less than 2, it's underdamped. But the options given are all less than 2, so that's probably okay.

The period of the undamped oscillator is T0 = 2π/ω₀. Since ω₀ is 1, T0 is 2π. The quasi-period T of the damped system is the period of the oscillations when there's damping. The formula for the quasi-period in underdamped systems is T = 2π / ω_d, where ω_d is the damped natural frequency. And ω_d is sqrt(ω₀² - β²). Wait, because ω_d = sqrt(ω₀² - (β)^2) or something like that?

Wait, let me get the damped frequency right. The damped natural frequency ω_d is sqrt(ω₀² - (β)^2). Since β is γ/2, ω_d would be sqrt(1 - (γ²/4)).

So the quasi-period T is 2π / ω_d. Which would be 2π / sqrt(1 - (γ²/4)).

The problem states that this T is 50% greater than T0. T0 is 2π. So T = 1.5 * T0 = 1.5 * 2π = 3π.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. The problem says the quasi-period is 50% greater than the undamped period. So that's 1.5 times T0. So T = 1.5 * (2π) ) = 3π.

But wait, another way to think: The undamped period is T0=2π, so 50% greater would be T = T0 * 1.5 = 3π. Right.

So setting T = 3π, and T is 2π / sqrt(1 - (γ²/4)).

So 3π = 2π / sqrt(1 - γ²/4).

Let me solve for gamma.

Divide both sides by π: 3 = 2 / sqrt(1 - γ²/4).

Multiply both sides by sqrt(1 - γ²/4): 3 * sqrt(1 - γ²/4) = 2.

Divide both sides by 3: sqrt(1 - γ²/4) = 2/3.

Square both sides: 1 - (γ²)/4 = (4/9).

So (γ²)/4 = 1 - 4/9 = 5/9.

Multiply both sides by 4: γ² = 20/9.

Take square root: γ = sqrt(20/9) = (2 * sqrt(5))/3.

Wait, sqrt(20/9) is sqrt(20)/3. Since sqrt(20) is 2*sqrt(5), so yes, γ is (2 sqrt(5))/3.

Let me compute that numerically. sqrt(5) is approximately 2.23607. So 2*2.23607 is 4.47214. Divide by 3: 4.47214 /3 ≈ 1.4907.

Looking at the options, option F is 1.4907. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the steps. Let me go through again.

We have T = 1.5 * T0.

T0 = 2π/ω₀, with ω₀=1 → T0=2π.

So T = 3π.

And T is 2π / sqrt(1 - β²), where β=γ/2.

So 3π = 2π / sqrt(1 - (γ/2)^2 )

Cancel 2π from both sides: 3 = 2 / sqrt(1 - γ²/4 )

Rearranged as sqrt(1 - γ²/4 ) = 2/3 → square → 1 - γ²/4 =4/9 → γ²/4=5/9 → γ²=20/9 → γ= sqrt(20/9)= (2sqrt5)/3 ≈ (2*2.236)/3≈4.472/3≈1.4907. Yep, that's correct. So the answer should be F.

To solve the problem, we start with the given differential equation for the vibrating system:

\[
u'' + \gamma u' + u = 0.
\]

This is a damped harmonic oscillator equation. Comparing it with the standard form:

\[
u'' + 2\beta u' + \omega_0^2 u = 0,
\]

we identify \( \beta = \frac{\gamma}{2} \) and \( \omega_0^2 = 1 \), so \( \omega_0 = 1 \). The problem involves finding the damping coefficient \( \gamma \) such that the quasi-period \( T \) of the damped motion is 50% greater than the period \( T_0 \) of the undamped motion.

The period of the undamped motion is:

\[
T_0 = \frac{2\pi}{\omega_0} = 2\pi.
\]

For the damped motion, the quasi-period is given by:

\[
T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega_d},
\]

where \( \omega_d = \sqrt{\omega_0^2 - \beta^2} = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{\gamma}{2}\right)^2} \). Substituting \( \omega_d \), the quasi-period becomes:

\[
T = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{\gamma^2}{4}}}.
\]

The problem states that \( T \) is 50% greater than \( T_0 \), so:

\[
T = 1.5 \cdot T_0 = 1.5 \cdot 2\pi = 3\pi.
\]

Equating the two expressions for \( T \):

\[
3\pi = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{\gamma^2}{4}}}.
\]

Dividing through by \( \pi \):

\[
3 = \frac{2}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{\gamma^2}{4}}}.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\sqrt{1 - \frac{\gamma^2}{4}} = \frac{2}{3}.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
1 - \frac{\gamma^2}{4} = \frac{4}{9}.
\]

Solving for \( \gamma^2 \):

\[
\frac{\gamma^2}{4} = 1 - \frac{4}{9} = \frac{5}{9}.
\]

\[
\gamma^2 = \frac{20}{9}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
\gamma = \frac{2\sqrt{5}}{3}.
\]

Numerically, \( \sqrt{5} \approx 2.236 \), so:

\[
\gamma \approx \frac{2 \cdot 2.236}{3} \approx 1.4907.
\]

From the given options, the closest value is \( 1.4907 \), which corresponds to option F.
