Okay, so I've got this question about memory systems, and I'm a bit new to this topic. Let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is asking which of the proposed memory systems is the most automatic. The options are A through I, each representing a different type of memory.

I remember that memory is categorized in various ways. One main distinction is between explicit and implicit memory. Explicit memory involves conscious recollection, like remembering events or facts. Implicit memory is more about unconscious memories, like skills and habits. So implicit memory is automatic because you don't have to think about it; it just happens.

Looking at the options, option A is Implicit memory. That seems like a possible answer. But wait, let me go through all the options to make sure I'm not missing something.

Option B: Autobiographical memory. That's part of explicit memory, right? It's about personal experiences and events, so it's more conscious and not automatic.

Option C: Semantic memory. That's also a type of explicit memory, dealing with facts and general knowledge. Again, it's more deliberate, not automatic.

Option D: Working memory. This is the system that temporarily holds information for processing. It's very much under conscious control, so not automatic.

Option E: Episodic memory. Another part of explicit memory, involving specific events. Not automatic.

Option F: Prospective memory. This is about remembering to do things in the future, like appointments. It can be automatic, like when you remember without consciously thinking, but I'm not sure if it's the most automatic.

Option G: Explicit memory. This is the broader category that includes autobiographical, semantic, and episodic. Since it's conscious, it's not automatic.

Option H: Declarative memory. This refers to knowledge that can be declared, like facts. It's part of explicit memory, so again, not automatic.

Option I: Sensory memory. This is the very brief storage of sensory information, like what you see or hear. It's automatic in the sense that it happens without conscious thought, but it's more about the initial capture of information rather than the type of long-term memory system.

So comparing the options, Implicit memory (A) is about unconscious, automatic processes. Sensory memory (I) is also automatic but very short-term. The question is about the most automatic of the proposed systems. Since implicit memory involves skills and habits that are automatically retrieved without conscious thought, it's likely the best answer.

Wait, but prospective memory (F) involves remembering future intentions. Sometimes it's automatic, like when you suddenly remember an appointment without thinking about it. But I'm not sure if it's considered more automatic than implicit memory. I think implicit is more consistently automatic because it's about the performance of skills without conscious thought.

So the answer should be A: Implicit memory.

The most automatic of the proposed memory systems is **Implicit memory**. This type of memory operates unconsciously, such as when performing skills or habits without deliberate thought. Other options, like prospective memory or sensory memory, involve some level of automaticity but are either more context-dependent or shorter-term. Implicit memory consistently functions automatically across various situations.

Answer: A
