Question:

The appraised values of houses in a city have a mean of $125,000 with a standard deviation of $23,000. Because of a new teachers' contract, the school district needs an extra 10% in funds compared to the previous year. To raise this additional money, the city instructs the assessment office to raise all appraised house values by $5,000. What will be the new standard deviation of the appraised values of houses in the city?

Options:

A: $29,000
B: $26,000
C: $25,300
D: $24,500
E: $28,000
F: $27,500
G: $32,500
H: $23,000
I: $31,000
J: $30,300

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this statistics problem here. Let me read it again and break it down.

The problem says that the appraised values of houses have a mean of $125,000 with a standard deviation of $23,000. Then, because of a new teachers' contract, the school district needs an extra 10% funds compared to last year. To get this extra money, the city tells the assessment office to raise all appraised house values by $5,000. The question is, what will be the new standard deviation after this change?

Hmm. So I remember that standard deviation is a measure of the spread of data, how much the values vary from the mean. Now, when you add a constant value to each data point, what happens to the standard deviation?

Wait, I think adding a constant shifts all the data points by that amount. So the mean will increase by that constant. Like, if every house's value goes up by $5k, then the new mean would be 125k +5k = $130k. But what about the standard deviation? Oh right, adding a constant doesn't affect the spread because all points move equally. So the standard deviation should stay the same. But wait, wait. Let me think again. Oh wait no, maybe I'm mixing this up with something else.

Wait, does adding a constant change the standard deviation? Or does it change when you multiply by a constant? Oh yeah, right. When you add a constant, the standard deviation remains the same because the spread doesn't change. But when you multiply each data point by a constant (like a percentage increase), then the standard deviation also gets multiplied by that constant. Because the spread increases proportionally.

So in this case, the city is adding $5,000 to each house's appraised value. So each data point increases by 5k. That would shift the mean up by 5k, but the standard deviation, which measures the spread around the mean, should stay the same. Because all the data points are moving by the same amount. So the new standard deviation would be the same as before, which is $23,000.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something here. Oh, but wait, the question says that the school district needs an extra 10% funds. So maybe the way they're achieving this is by increasing each house's value by a certain percentage, not a fixed amount. But in the problem statement, it's clearly stated that they're raising all appraised house values by $5,000, not by 10%. So the 10% is the required increase in funds. So I'm thinking, perhaps they're increasing each house's value by a flat $5k, not a percentage of their current value.

So that means each house's value is increased by $5,000. So the mean goes up by 5k, but the standard deviation remains unchanged because adding a constant doesn't affect the spread.

Wait, but let me think about it another way. Suppose the original data has a standard deviation of 23k. If you add 5k to each value, the data points are all shifted up, but their distances from the new mean (which is also shifted up by 5k) remain the same as before. So the spread is the same, so standard deviation is the same.

So the new standard deviation should still be $23,000. Looking at the options, option H is $23,000.

Wait, but another thought. Maybe I'm misapplying the concept. Let me recall: standard deviation is calculated as the square root of the variance. Variance is the average of the squared differences from the mean.

So if you add a constant (let's say c) to every data point, then each (x_i + c) will have a new mean of (mean + c). The squared differences become (x_i + c - (mean + c))^2 = (x_i - mean)^2. So the variance remains the same, so standard deviation remains same.

If instead, you multiply each data point by a constant (let's say k), then each term becomes k*(x_i), and the mean becomes k*mean. The squared differences become (k x_i - k mean)^2 = k^2 (x_i - mean)^2. So variance becomes k^2 times original variance, so standard deviation becomes k times original standard deviation.

So in this problem, since they're adding a constant ($5,000) to each value, the standard deviation doesn't change. So the answer should be $23,000, which is option H.

Wait, but why is the problem mentioning the 10% increase in funds needed? That's a bit confusing. Let me make sure I'm understanding the scenario correctly.

The school district needs 10% more funds than the previous year. To get that, they're increasing each appraised value by $5k. So the total funds would be based on the new appraised values. But how does that 10% relate to the $5k? Perhaps that's just background, but for the statistical part, it's the $5k addition that matters.

So the 10% is probably the reason why they're adding $5k, but for the standard deviation calculation, it's the method of addition that affects the result, not the percentage of funds increase.

So yes, the standard deviation remains at $23k. So the correct answer is H.
</think>

The problem involves determining the new standard deviation of appraised house values after a constant increase of $5,000 is applied to all values. Initially, the mean is $125,000, and the standard deviation is $23,000. Adding a constant to each data point shifts the mean but does not affect the spread of the data. 

Standard deviation measures the spread of data points around the mean, and adding a constant to every value does not change the relative distances between the data points and the mean. Therefore, the standard deviation remains unchanged at $23,000.

The mention of a 10% increase in funds is contextual, explaining why the $5,000 increase is implemented, but it does not affect the statistical calculation of the standard deviation. Thus, the new standard deviation remains the same as the original.

The correct answer is:

**H: $23,000**

H
