Question:

Discuss Murray's theory of motivation and what influence it had on McClelland's development of the Achievement Motivation model.

Options:

A: McClelland's model was influenced by Hull's theory of survival instincts
B: McClelland's model expanded on Murray's theory by introducing the idea that motivation is primarily driven by social comparison, which wasn't a focus in Murray's work.
C: Murray's theory had no influence on McClelland's model
D: McClelland's model was a direct copy of Murray's ideas
E: McClelland's Achievement Motivation model was influenced by Murray's theory of motivation that human behavior is a reflection of individual needs and motives, and that anything leading to positive affect produces approach behavior and anything leading to negative affect produces avoidance behavior.
F: McClelland's Achievement Motivation model was influenced by Murray's emphasis on psychosocial stages of development, which is not actually a part of Murray's theory.
G: McClelland's model disregarded Murray's focus on individual needs and instead proposed that environmental factors are the only determinants of human motivation.
H: McClelland's model was based on the premise that motivation is solely a product of external rewards and punishments, without any influence from Murray's theory.
I: McClelland's model was influenced by Murray's hierarchy of needs, which is a confusion with Maslow's theory, not Murray's.
J: Murray's theory suggested that motivation is derived from subconscious sexual and aggressive drives, which McClelland incorporated directly into his model.

Okay, so I have this question about Murray's theory of motivation and how it influenced McClelland's Achievement Motivation model. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Henry Murray developed a theory that emphasized various needs and motives that drive human behavior. His work talked about different needs like the need for achievement, which I think McClelland expanded on. So Murray's theory must have been a foundation for McClelland.

Now, looking at the options. Option A says McClelland was influenced by Hull's survival instincts. I'm not too sure about that. I think Hull was more about drive reduction, like physiological needs. But I don't recall McClelland's model being based on that. So probably not A.

Option B suggests McClelland introduced social comparison as a primary motivator, which wasn't in Murray's work. Wait, I'm not sure. Murray's theory was more about individual needs, not so much comparing with others. So McClelland might have added that, but I don't remember if that's accurate. Maybe, but I'm not certain.

Option C says Murray had no influence. That can't be right because I think McClelland did build on Murray's needs, especially the need for achievement. So C is probably wrong.

Option D claims McClelland copied Murray's ideas directly. I don't think so. McClelland's model is more specific about achievement motivation, breaking it down into three needs: achievement, power, and affiliation. So D seems incorrect.

Option E says McClelland was influenced by Murray's theory that behavior reflects individual needs and motives, and that positive affect leads to approach behavior while negative leads to avoidance. That sounds familiar. Murray did talk about how people are motivated by their internal needs, and their behaviors are guided by whether they expect positive or negative outcomes. So E seems plausible.

Option F mentions psychosocial stages, which I think is Erikson's thing, not Murray's. So F is probably wrong.

Option G says McClelland focused only on environmental factors. No, I think McClelland's model is about internal motives, like the need for achievement, so G doesn't fit.

Option H suggests motivation is only from external rewards. That doesn't sound right because McClelland's model is more about internal drives, like the need to achieve. So H is probably incorrect.

Option I talks about a hierarchy of needs, which is Maslow, not Murray. So I is wrong because it's confusing the two theories.

Option J says Murray's theory was about subconscious sexual and aggressive drives. That sounds more like Freud. Murray's needs are more diverse and include things like achievement, not just sexual/aggressive drives. So J is incorrect.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be E. McClelland's model was influenced by Murray's ideas about individual needs and how positive and negative affects guide behavior.

The correct answer is E. Murray's theory of motivation, which posits that human behavior is driven by individual needs and motives, and that positive affect leads to approach behavior while negative affect leads to avoidance, directly influenced McClelland's Achievement Motivation model. McClelland expanded on Murray's work, particularly focusing on the need for achievement, and incorporated these principles into his own theory.

Answer: E
