Okay, so I have this question about improper integrals and Laplace transforms. Hmm, let me think. The question is asking me to determine for which values of s the integral G(s) converges, and then find the Laplace transform of f(t) = 1.

Alright, let's break it down. The integral given is from 0 to infinity of e^(-st) dt. So G(s) is the integral from 0 to ∞ of e^(-st) dt. Wait, and this is an improper integral because the upper limit is infinity. So I need to evaluate this integral and see for which s it converges.

I remember that the Laplace transform of a function f(t) is defined as the integral from 0 to infinity of e^(-st) f(t) dt. In this case, f(t) is 1, so the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ e^(-st) * 1 dt = ∫₀^∞ e^(-st) dt.

Okay, so to compute this integral, I can integrate e^(-st) with respect to t. The antiderivative of e^(-st) is (-1/s) e^(-st), right? So evaluating from 0 to ∞.

Let me write that out:

G(s) = [ (-1/s) e^(-st) ] from t=0 to t=∞.

So plugging in the limits, at t=∞, what's e^(-st) as t approaches infinity? Well, it depends on the real part of s. Because if Re{s} > 0, then as t goes to infinity, e^(-st) tends to zero. But if Re{s} is less than or equal to zero, e^(-st) might blow up or oscillate (if s is complex), but in this case, since we're dealing with real functions, s is probably a real variable here.

Wait, actually, in Laplace transforms, s can be a complex number, but for convergence, we often consider the real part Re{s}. The integral converges if Re{s} > 0 because the exponential term decays to zero, making the integral finite.

So back to evaluating the integral. At t=∞, e^(-s∞) is 0 if Re{s} > 0. At t=0, e^(-s*0) is 1. So the expression becomes:

G(s) = [0 - (-1/s)(1)] = (1/s).

But this is only valid when Re{s} > 0, because otherwise the exponential might not decay, and the integral would diverge.

So, G(s) converges to 1/s when Re{s} > 0 and diverges otherwise.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C says exactly that: converges to 1/s for Re{s} >0 and diverges otherwise, and the Laplace transform of 1 is 1/s for Re{s} >0.

Another option is B, which says it converges for all s, which I don't think is correct because if s is negative real, e^(-st) would grow exponentially, making the integral diverge.

Option E says it converges for Re{s} <0, which can't be right because then the exponential would blow up.

Option C is looking good. Let me make sure I didn't miss any other possibilities.

Wait, in the integral, if s is zero, then e^(-0*t)=1, so the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ 1 dt, which diverges. So s=0 is not included, which aligns with Re{s} >0.

So the correct answer should be option C.

To determine the values of \( s \) for which the improper integral 

\[
G(s) = \int_0^\infty e^{-st} dt
\]

converges and to find the Laplace transform of \( f(t) = 1 \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Evaluate the Integral**: The integral \( G(s) \) is the Laplace transform of \( f(t) = 1 \). To compute it, we find the antiderivative of \( e^{-st} \), which is \( -\frac{1}{s} e^{-st} \). Evaluating this from \( t = 0 \) to \( t = \infty \), we get:

   \[
   G(s) = \left[ -\frac{1}{s} e^{-st} \right]_0^\infty.
   \]

2. **Behavior at the Limits**:
   - As \( t \to \infty \), \( e^{-st} \to 0 \) if \( \text{Re}\{s\} > 0 \), ensuring convergence.
   - At \( t = 0 \), \( e^{-s \cdot 0} = 1 \).

   Substituting these results:

   \[
   G(s) = \left( 0 - \left(-\frac{1}{s}\right) \right) = \frac{1}{s}.
   \]

3. **Convergence Condition**: The integral converges if and only if \( \text{Re}\{s\} > 0 \). For \( \text{Re}\{s\} \leq 0 \), \( e^{-st} \) does not decay sufficiently, and the integral diverges.

4. **Laplace Transform**: The Laplace transform of \( f(t) = 1 \) is \( \mathcal{L}\{1\} = \frac{1}{s} \), valid for \( \text{Re}\{s\} > 0 \).

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. \( G(s) \) does not diverge for all \( s \); it converges for \( \text{Re}\{s\} > 0 \).
- **Option B**: Incorrect. \( G(s) \) does not converge for all \( s \); it diverges for \( \text{Re}\{s\} \leq 0 \).
- **Option C**: Correct. \( G(s) \) converges to \( \frac{1}{s} \) for \( \text{Re}\{s\} > 0 \) and diverges otherwise. The Laplace transform of \( f(t) = 1 \) is \( \frac{1}{s} \), valid for \( \text{Re}\{s\} > 0 \).
- **Option D**: Incorrect. \( G(s) \) does not converge for \( \text{Re}\{s\} = 0 \), and the Laplace transform is not \( \frac{2}{s^2} \).
- **Option E**: Incorrect. \( G(s) \) does not converge for \( \text{Re}\{s\} < 0 \).
- **Option F**: Incorrect. \( G(s) \) does not converge for \( \text{Re}\{s\} > 2 \) specifically, and the result is not \( \frac{2}{s} \).
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The Laplace transform of \( f(t) = 1 \) is not \( \frac{1}{s^2} \).
- **Option H**: Incorrect. \( G(s) \) does not converge to \( \frac{s}{2} \) for \( \text{Re}\{s\} > 1 \).
- **Option I**: Incorrect. \( G(s) \) does not converge for \( s = 0 \) only.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The Laplace transform of \( f(t) = 1 \) is not \( s \).

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **C**.
