Okay, so I've got this question here about markup percentages, and I'm a bit confused because I'm not entirely sure I remember all the formulas correctly. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says the markup on a camera is 20% based on the cost. I need to find the percent markup based on the selling price. Hmm, right, markup can be calculated in two ways: based on cost or based on selling price. I think the formula for markup based on cost is (Markup/Cost) * 100, and the markup itself is the difference between the selling price and the cost.

Wait, let me make sure. So, if the markup is 20% on cost, that means the selling price is cost plus 20% of the cost. So, if the cost is, say, $100, then the markup would be $20, making the selling price $120. But wait, that might not be the only way to look at it. 

So, let me define some variables to make this clearer. Let's say the cost price is C, and the selling price is S. The markup (M) is the profit, which is S - C. 

When the markup is based on cost, it's M/C * 100. So, in this case, 20% = M/C, which means M = 0.2 * C. 

So substituting M into the selling price, S = C + 0.2C = 1.2C. 

Now, the question is asking for the markup based on the selling price. So, that formula would be (Markup/Selling Price) * 100. So, M/S * 100. 

We already know that M is 0.2C, and S is 1.2C. So substituting those values in, M/S = (0.2C) / (1.2C). Oh, wait, the C cancels out because it's in numerator and denominator. So 0.2/1.2 = 1/6. Wait, 0.2 divided by 1.2 is the same as (2/10) / (12/10) which is 2/12, which simplifies to 1/6. 

1/6 as a decimal is approximately 0.166666..., which is 16.666...%, so that's 16 and two-thirds percent. 

Let me double-check that. If cost is $100, then markup is 20% of 100, which is $20. So selling price is $120. Now, markup based on selling price is $20 / $120 = 1/6 ≈ 16.67%. That makes sense. 

So looking at the options, option B is 16(2/3)%, which is exactly 16.666...%, so that's the correct answer. 

Wait, but I should make sure I didn't mix up the formulas. Let me think again. Markup on cost is (S - C)/C, which is 20%. So S = 1.2C. Markup on selling price is (S - C)/S, which is (0.2C)/(1.2C) = 0.2/1.2 = 1/6 ≈ 16.67%. Yep, that's correct. 

So the answer should be option B.

To determine the percent markup based on the selling price when the markup is 20% based on the cost, we start by defining the cost price as \( C \), the selling price as \( S \), and the markup as \( M \). 

1. **Markup based on cost**:  
   The markup is calculated as \( \frac{M}{C} \times 100\% \). Given that this is 20%, we have:  
   \[
   M = 0.2C
   \]  
   The selling price is then:  
   \[
   S = C + M = C + 0.2C = 1.2C
   \]

2. **Markup based on selling price**:  
   The formula for markup based on selling price is \( \frac{M}{S} \times 100\% \). Substituting \( M = 0.2C \) and \( S = 1.2C \):  
   \[
   \frac{M}{S} = \frac{0.2C}{1.2C} = \frac{0.2}{1.2} = \frac{1}{6} \approx 0.1667
   \]  
   Converting this to a percentage:  
   \[
   0.1667 \times 100\% = 16.67\% = 16\frac{2}{3}\%
   \]

Thus, the percent markup based on the selling price is **16(2/3)%**, which corresponds to option B.
