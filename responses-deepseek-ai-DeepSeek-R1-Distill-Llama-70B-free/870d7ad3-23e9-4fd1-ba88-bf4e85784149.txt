Okay, so I've got this problem here about a rectangle where the area and the perimeter are equal. Hmm, that sounds interesting. Let me try to break it down.

The rectangle has a length of 3x inches and a width of x + 5 inches. I need to find the value of x from the given options. Alright, so I remember that the area of a rectangle is length multiplied by width, and the perimeter is calculated as twice the sum of length and width.

So, the area (A) would be 3x multiplied by (x + 5). Let me write that down: A = 3x*(x +5). Expanding that, it's 3x^2 + 15x.

The perimeter (P) is 2 times (length + width). That would be P = 2*(3x + x +5). Simplifying inside the parentheses: 3x + x is 4x, plus 5 gives 4x +5. So P = 2*(4x +5) which is 8x +10.

The problem states that the area and perimeter are equal, so I set A equal to P. That gives me the equation: 3x² +15x = 8x +10.

Wait, okay, now I need to solve for x. Let me bring all terms to one side so I can form a quadratic equation. Subtract 8x and 10 from both sides: 3x² +15x -8x -10 =0. Simplifying that, 15x-8x is 7x, so it becomes 3x² +7x -10 =0.

Now I have a quadratic equation: 3x² +7x -10 =0. To solve this, I can use the quadratic formula. The formula is x = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)]/(2a). Here, a=3, b=7, c=-10.

Calculating the discriminant first: b² -4ac = (7)^2 -4*(3)*(-10) = 49 +120 =169. Oh, the square root of 169 is 13.

So, plugging into the formula: x = [-7 ±13]/(2*3). That gives two possible solutions: one with plus and one with minus.

First solution: (-7 +13)/(6) = 6/6 =1.

Second solution: (-7 -13)/(6) = (-20)/6 = -10/3. Wait, but x represents a length, right? So it can't be negative. So x must be 1.

But wait, let me double-check because sometimes I might make a mistake in the calculations. Let me plug x=1 back into the original expressions for area and perimeter.

Length is 3x =3*1=3 inches. Width is x+5=1+5=6 inches. Area is 3*6=18. Perimeter is 2*(3+6)=2*9=18. Oh yeah, they are equal. So x=1 is correct.

Looking at the options, option F is 1. So the answer should be F.

To solve the problem, we start by noting that the area and perimeter of the rectangle are equal. The length of the rectangle is given as \(3x\) inches, and the width is \(x + 5\) inches.

1. **Calculate the area**:  
   The area \(A\) of the rectangle is:  
   \[
   A = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 3x \cdot (x + 5) = 3x^2 + 15x
   \]

2. **Calculate the perimeter**:  
   The perimeter \(P\) of the rectangle is:  
   \[
   P = 2 \cdot (\text{length} + \text{width}) = 2 \cdot (3x + x + 5) = 2 \cdot (4x + 5) = 8x + 10
   \]

3. **Set the area equal to the perimeter**:  
   Since the area and perimeter are equal, we set \(A = P\):  
   \[
   3x^2 + 15x = 8x + 10
   \]

4. **Solve the quadratic equation**:  
   Rearranging the equation:  
   \[
   3x^2 + 15x - 8x - 10 = 0 \implies 3x^2 + 7x - 10 = 0
   \]

   Using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 3\), \(b = 7\), and \(c = -10\):  
   \[
   x = \frac{-7 \pm \sqrt{7^2 - 4 \cdot 3 \cdot (-10)}}{2 \cdot 3} = \frac{-7 \pm \sqrt{49 + 120}}{6} = \frac{-7 \pm \sqrt{169}}{6} = \frac{-7 \pm 13}{6}
   \]

   This gives two solutions:  
   \[
   x = \frac{-7 + 13}{6} = \frac{6}{6} = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{-7 - 13}{6} = \frac{-20}{6} = -\frac{10}{3}
   \]

   Since \(x\) represents a length, it cannot be negative. Thus, \(x = 1\).

5. **Verify the solution**:  
   Substituting \(x = 1\) back into the expressions for area and perimeter:  
   - Length: \(3x = 3 \cdot 1 = 3\) inches  
   - Width: \(x + 5 = 1 + 5 = 6\) inches  
   - Area: \(3 \cdot 6 = 18\)  
   - Perimeter: \(2 \cdot (3 + 6) = 2 \cdot 9 = 18\)  

   Both the area and perimeter are equal to 18, confirming that \(x = 1\) is correct.

From the given options, the correct answer is **F: 1**.
