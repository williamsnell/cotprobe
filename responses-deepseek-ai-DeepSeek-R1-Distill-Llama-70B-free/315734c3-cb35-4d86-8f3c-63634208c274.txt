Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the family as a socializing agent and Baumrind's study. Hmm, I remember that the family is considered a primary socializing agent because children spend a lot of time with their families early in life. They learn basic social skills, values, and norms from their parents and siblings.

Now, Baumrind's study from 1967 is about parenting styles and how they affect children's personalities. I think she identified three main styles: authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive. Authoritative parents are both warm and demanding, setting clear expectations but also encouraging independence. Authoritarian parents are strict and punitive, focusing on obedience without much warmth. Permissive parents are more lenient and avoid confrontation, letting the child make many decisions.

Baumrind found that the authoritative style was associated with positive outcomes, like independence and social competence. Authoritarian parenting was linked to more aggressive behavior, and permissive might lead to lower self-control. So her study shows a clear relationship between the type of discipline (parenting style) and the child's personality.

Looking at the options:

Option J says the family is the first important agent and Baumrind found a relation between discipline and child's personality. That sounds right because family is primary and Baumrind did link parenting styles to child outcomes.

Option A says family is least important, which is wrong because family is one of the most important.

Options B and D say family is secondary to others, which doesn't fit with what I know about socialization.

Options C, E, F, G, H, I are incorrect because Baumrind's study does show that parenting styles influence children's personalities. So any option denying that is wrong.

So the correct answer should be J.

The family is the first important and most powerful socializing agent in a child's life. Baumrind's study found that a child's personality is related to the type of discipline he receives from his parents.
