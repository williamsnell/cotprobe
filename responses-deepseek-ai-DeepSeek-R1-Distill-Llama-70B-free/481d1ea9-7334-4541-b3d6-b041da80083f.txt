Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully. The question says that a 1000-gram metal block fell through a distance of 10 meters, and all its energy went into heat. I need to find out how many units of heat energy appeared. The options are from A to J, and I have to pick the right one.

Hmm, right. So, when the block falls, it's converting potential energy into kinetic energy, and when it stops, that kinetic energy is converted into heat. So the heat generated should be equal to the potential energy the block had before falling.

Wait, but wait. The block is falling, so the potential energy is mgh, right? Mass times gravity times height. Oh, but wait, the mass here is given in grams, and I'm more used to working in kilograms. So I'll need to convert that.

The mass is 1000 grams. Oh yeah, 1000 grams is 1 kilogram. That makes it easier. So m is 1 kg.

Gravity, g, is approximately 9.8 m/s². So I'll use that value.

The height it fell through is 10 meters. So putting it all together, the potential energy (which becomes heat) is mgh = 1 kg * 9.8 m/s² * 10 m.

Let me calculate that. 1 * 9.8 is 9.8, times 10 is 98. So the potential energy is 98 Joules.

But wait, the answer options are in calories, not Joules. Right, because the question asks for units of heat energy, and I think in this context it's referring to calories. So I need to convert Joules to calories.

I remember that 1 calorie is approximately 4.184 Joules. So to find out how many calories 98 Joules is, I divide 98 by 4.184.

Let me do that calculation. 98 divided by 4.184. Let me see, 4.184 times 23 is about 96.3, because 4*23 is 92, and 0.184*23 is roughly 4.232, so total around 96.232. So 23 times 4.184 is about 96.232. So 98 is a bit more than that. Let me compute 98 / 4.184.

Alternatively, I can approximate. Since 4.184 is close to 4.2, maybe it's easier to calculate 98 / 4.2. Let's try that.

4.2 times 23 is 96.6. 4.2 * 23.3 = 4.2*(23 + 0.3) = 96.6 + 1.26 = 97.86. Hmm, 23.3 would give 97.86, which is still a little under 98. 4.2 * 23.33 is about 98. So 4.2 * 23.333... is 98. So 98 /4.2 is approximately 23.333, so around 23.33 calories.

Wait, but since 1 cal is 4.184 J exactly, let's be precise. 98 divided by 4.184.

So 4.184 times 23.5 is let's calculate: 23 *4.184= 96.232, 0.5*4.184=2.092, so total 98.324. Hmm, that's a bit over 98. So 23.5 *4.184 is 98.324 J, which is a bit higher than 98. So 98 J is a little less than 23.5 cal. So maybe approximately 23.4 cal.

Looking at the options, I see option F is 23.5 cal, which is very close to my calculation. But wait, let me double-check my approach.

Potential energy is mgh, right, so 1 kg *9.8 m/s² *10m is indeed 98 J. Converting that to calories: 98 J /4.184 J/cal ≈ 23.42 cal. So about 23.4 cal. The closest option is F, 23.5 cal. So I think that's the right answer.

But wait, let me check the options again. Option F is 23.5 cal, yes. Option I is 4.19 cal, which is exactly 1 calorie in Joules, but that's way too small. So F must be the right choice.

To determine how many units of heat energy appeared when a 1000-gram metal block fell through a distance of 10 meters, we start by calculating the potential energy of the block before it fell. The potential energy is given by the formula:

\[
PE = mgh
\]

Where:
- \( m = 1000 \, \text{g} = 1 \, \text{kg} \) (converted to kilograms),
- \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) (acceleration due to gravity),
- \( h = 10 \, \text{m} \) (height the block fell through).

Substituting the values:

\[
PE = 1 \cdot 9.8 \cdot 10 = 98 \, \text{J}
\]

Since all the potential energy is converted into heat, the heat energy is also \( 98 \, \text{J} \). To convert this to calories (cal), we use the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{cal} = 4.184 \, \text{J} \):

\[
\text{Heat energy in calories} = \frac{98}{4.184} \approx 23.42 \, \text{cal}
\]

Among the given options, the closest value to \( 23.42 \, \text{cal} \) is \( 23.5 \, \text{cal} \), which corresponds to option F.
