Okay, so I've got this problem here about volatile liquids A and B. Hmm, I remember from my chemistry class that when dealing with mixtures of liquids, their vapor pressures play a role in the solution's behavior when the pressure changes. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that the pure vapor pressures are P_A* = 165 Torr and P_B* = 85.1 Torr. They're confined in a piston and cylinder setup, starting with just the liquid. When the pressure is reduced, the first vapor appears at a total pressure of 110 Torr. I need to calculate the mole fraction of A, x_A.

Wait, I think this is about the vapor pressure of the solution when it just starts to boil. So when the external pressure is reduced to the point where the solution's vapor pressure equals that external pressure, the first vapor forms. So at that point, the sum of the partial pressures of A and B equals the total pressure.

Right, Raoult's Law applies here. Raoult's Law says that the partial pressure of each component is equal to its mole fraction in the liquid multiplied by its pure vapor pressure. So, P_A = x_A * P_A*, and P_B = x_B * P_B*. Since it's a binary solution, x_A + x_B = 1. Therefore, P_B = (1 - x_A) * P_B*.

The total pressure P_total is P_A + P_B. And at the point where the first vapor appears, P_total equals 110 Torr. So:

x_A * P_A* + (1 - x_A) * P_B* = 110 Torr.

Plugging in the numbers:

x_A * 165 + (1 - x_A) * 85.1 = 110.

Let me solve for x_A. Expanding the equation:

165 x_A + 85.1 (1 - x_A) = 110.

Multiply it out:

165x_A + 85.1 - 85.1 x_A = 110.

Combine like terms:

(165 - 85.1) x_A +85.1 = 110.

165-85.1 is 79.9, so:

79.9 x_A = 110 - 85.1.

110 minus 85.1 is 24.9.

So 79.9 x_A = 24.9 → x_A = 24.9 /79.9.

Let me calculate that. 24.9 divided by 79.9. Hmm, 79.9 is about 80, so 24.9/80 is 0.31125. That's approximately 0.311.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.312, which is very close. So probably the correct answer is C.

Wait, let me check my calculations again to be sure.

165 x_A +85.1(1-x_A) =110.

165x_A +85.1 -85.1x_A =110.

(165-85.1)x_A = 24.9 → 79.9 x_A=24.9 → x_A=24.9/79.9.

Calculating 24.9 /79.9:

Well, 79.9 is 80-0.1. So 24.9/(80-0.1) = approximately 0.31125, yeah. So 0.311, which rounds to 0.311. So the closest option is C: 0.312.

I think that's correct.

To solve the problem, we use Raoult's Law, which states that the total vapor pressure of a solution is the sum of the partial pressures of its components. For a binary solution of volatile liquids \( A \) and \( B \), the total pressure is given by:

\[
P_{\text{total}} = x_A P_A^* + x_B P_B^*
\]

where \( x_A \) and \( x_B \) are the mole fractions of \( A \) and \( B \) in the liquid phase, \( P_A^* \) and \( P_B^* \) are the pure vapor pressures of \( A \) and \( B \), and \( x_A + x_B = 1 \). Substituting \( x_B = 1 - x_A \), the equation becomes:

\[
P_{\text{total}} = x_A P_A^* + (1 - x_A) P_B^*
\]

At the point where the first vapor appears, the total pressure equals the external pressure, which is \( P_{\text{total}} = 110 \, \text{Torr} \). Substituting the given values \( P_A^* = 165 \, \text{Torr} \) and \( P_B^* = 85.1 \, \text{Torr} \), we have:

\[
110 = x_A (165) + (1 - x_A)(85.1)
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
110 = 165x_A + 85.1 - 85.1x_A
\]

\[
110 - 85.1 = (165 - 85.1)x_A
\]

\[
24.9 = 79.9x_A
\]

Solving for \( x_A \):

\[
x_A = \frac{24.9}{79.9} \approx 0.311
\]

The closest option to \( x_A = 0.311 \) is \( 0.312 \), which corresponds to option **C**.
