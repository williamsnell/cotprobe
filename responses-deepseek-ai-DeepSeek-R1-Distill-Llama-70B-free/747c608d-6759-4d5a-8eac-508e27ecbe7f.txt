Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine the constant c such that the function f(x) = c x^3 (1-x)^6 is a probability density function (pdf) on the interval 0 < x < 1. Hmm, okay, I remember that for a function to be a valid pdf, the integral over its entire domain must equal 1. So I think I need to set up the integral of f(x) from 0 to 1 and set it equal to 1, then solve for c.

Let me write down the integral. So the integral of c x^3 (1-x)^6 dx from 0 to 1 should equal 1. That makes sense. Now, I need to compute this integral and solve for c.

But wait, how do I compute this integral? I think this might be related to the Beta function. The Beta function is something like B(p, q) = integral from 0 to 1 of x^(p-1) (1-x)^(q-1) dx, right? And the Beta function is related to the Gamma function by B(p, q) = Γ(p)Γ(q)/Γ(p+q). Oh right, and Γ(n) is (n-1)! when n is a positive integer.

Looking at my function, the exponents are 3 and 6. So p-1 would be 3, meaning p is 4, and q-1 is 6, so q is 7. So the integral without the c would be B(4,7) = Γ(4)Γ(7)/Γ(4+7) = Γ(4)Γ(7)/Γ(11).

Let me calculate those Gamma functions. Γ(4) is 3! which is 6. Γ(7) is 6! which is 720. Γ(11) is 10! which is 3628800.

So putting those together, B(4,7) = (6 * 720) / 3628800. Let's compute that numerator: 6*720 is 4320. Then 4320 divided by 3628800. Let me simplify that. Dividing numerator and denominator by 4320, I get 1 / 840. So B(4,7) = 1/840.

Wait, but the integral of f(x) is c times B(4,7), which is c*(1/840). And this should equal 1, because it's a pdf. So 1 = c*(1/840), which implies c = 840.

Hmm, looking at the options, option J is 840. So the answer should be option J.

Wait, let me double-check. Did I make a mistake in the Beta function parameters? Because the exponents are x^3 and (1-x)^6, which correspond to p=4 and q=7. Yes, that's correct. And the Gamma functions are correct too. 4! is 24 wait no, wait Γ(4) is 3! = 6, right. Because Γ(n) = (n-1)! So yes, Γ(4)=6, Γ(7)=720, Γ(11)=10! = 3628800.

So 6 *720 is 4320. 4320 / 3628800 is 1/840. So yeah, c must be 840. So option J is correct.

To determine the constant \( c \) such that \( f(x) = c x^3 (1-x)^6 \) is a valid probability density function (pdf) over the interval \( 0 < x < 1 \), we require that the integral of \( f(x) \) over this interval equals 1:

\[
\int_0^1 c x^3 (1-x)^6 \, dx = 1.
\]

This integral is related to the Beta function, \( B(p, q) \), which is defined as:

\[
B(p, q) = \int_0^1 x^{p-1} (1-x)^{q-1} \, dx = \frac{\Gamma(p)\Gamma(q)}{\Gamma(p+q)},
\]

where \( \Gamma(n) = (n-1)! \) for positive integers \( n \). Comparing the given function to the Beta function, we identify \( p = 4 \) and \( q = 7 \), since the exponents of \( x \) and \( (1-x) \) are 3 and 6, respectively.

Thus, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^1 c x^3 (1-x)^6 \, dx = c \cdot B(4, 7).
\]

Substituting the values of \( p \) and \( q \) into the Beta function:

\[
B(4, 7) = \frac{\Gamma(4)\Gamma(7)}{\Gamma(11)}.
\]

Using \( \Gamma(4) = 3! = 6 \), \( \Gamma(7) = 6! = 720 \), and \( \Gamma(11) = 10! = 3628800 \), we calculate:

\[
B(4, 7) = \frac{6 \cdot 720}{3628800} = \frac{4320}{3628800} = \frac{1}{840}.
\]

Therefore, the integral becomes:

\[
c \cdot \frac{1}{840} = 1.
\]

Solving for \( c \):

\[
c = 840.
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**J: 840**
