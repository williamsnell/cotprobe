Okay, so I've got this problem here about John choosing marbles. Let me try to understand what's being asked. So, John has 12 marbles, each a different color. Among them are a red, a green, and a blue marble. He wants to choose 4 marbles, but the condition is that exactly one of them must be either red, green, or blue. Hmm, okay.

Let me break this down. So, the total marbles are 12, and three of them are special: red, green, blue. The rest must be non-special, right? So that's 12 -3 = 9 regular marbles.

He needs to pick 4 marbles. But exactly one of them has to be from the special group. So, that means one is either red, green, or blue, and the other three must be from the regular ones.

So, how do I calculate this? Well, I think combinatorics is involved here. Combinations, because the order doesn't matter when picking the marbles.

So, the problem can be split into two parts: choosing the special marble and choosing the regular marbles.

First, how many ways are there to choose one special marble? There are three special ones (red, green, blue). So, the number of ways to choose exactly one is C(3,1), which is 3.

Then, after choosing one special, we need to choose the remaining three marbles from the regular ones. There are 9 regular marbles, so the number of ways to choose 3 is C(9,3).

Now, the total number of ways is the product of these two combinations, right? So, total ways = C(3,1) * C(9,3).

Let me compute these values. C(3,1) is 3. C(9,3) is calculated as 9!/(3! * (9-3)! )= (9*8*7)/(3*2*1)= 84.

So, 3 *84 equals 252. So the answer should be 252.

Let me check the options. Option D is 252, so that should be the correct answer.

To determine the number of ways John can choose 4 marbles such that exactly one is red, green, or blue, we can break the problem into two parts:

1. **Choosing one special marble (red, green, or blue):**  
   There are 3 special marbles, and we need to choose exactly one. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula \( \binom{3}{1} \), which equals 3.

2. **Choosing the remaining three marbles from the regular ones:**  
   There are 9 regular marbles (12 total marbles minus the 3 special ones). The number of ways to choose 3 marbles from these 9 is given by \( \binom{9}{3} \). Calculating this:  
   \[
   \binom{9}{3} = \frac{9!}{3!(9-3)!} = \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 84
   \]

3. **Total number of ways:**  
   Multiply the number of ways to choose the special marble by the number of ways to choose the regular marbles:  
   \[
   \text{Total ways} = \binom{3}{1} \times \binom{9}{3} = 3 \times 84 = 252
   \]

Thus, the correct answer is **252**, which corresponds to option **D**.
