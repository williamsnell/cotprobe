Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because stoichiometry has always been a little tricky for me. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about neutralizing a calcium hydroxide solution with HCl. Hmm. So, the lab technician made Ca(OH)₂ solution by dissolving 1.48 grams of it in water. I need to find out how many milliliters of 0.125 N HCl are required to neutralize it.

Wait, wait. I remember that N stands for Normality. Right, Normality is equivalent to the molarity multiplied by the number of equivalents per mole. For acids and bases, it's about the H+ or OH- ions they can produce.

So first, I think I need to figure out the moles of Ca(OH)₂. Let me calculate the molar mass of Ca(OH)₂. Calcium (Ca) has an atomic weight of about 40.08 g/mol. Each hydroxide (OH) group is 16 + 1 = 17 g/mol. Since there are two OH groups, that's 2 * 17 = 34. So the molar mass of Ca(OH)₂ is 40.08 + 34 = 74.08 g/mol.

Wait, wait. Wait, actually, wait a second. The formula is Ca(OH)₂, which I think is calcium hydroxide. So yes, each OH is -1, so two of them make Ca²+ and (OH)₂^2-? No, wait, no. Wait, calcium hydroxide is Ca(OH)₂, but wait, Ca²+ and each OH⁻ is -1, so two OH⁻ make -2, so Ca(OH)₂ would have formula Ca(OH)₂, which makes sense.

So, moles of Ca(OH)₂ = mass / molar mass. The mass given is 1.48 grams. So moles = 1.48 g / 74.08 g/mol. Let me compute that. 1.48 divided by 74.08... Hmm, I can approximate this. 74 grams per mole, so 1.48 grams is about 0.02 moles because 74 * 0.02 = 1.48. So yeah, 0.02 moles of Ca(OH)₂.

Now, the reaction between Ca(OH)₂ and HCl. Let's write the neutralization reaction. Calcium hydroxide is a base, and HCl is an acid. So they'll react in an acid-base neutralization.

The reaction should be: Ca(OH)₂ + 2 HCl → CaCl₂ + 2 H₂O.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. Ca(OH)₂ has two OH⁻ ions. Each HCl gives one H⁺. So to neutralize two OH⁻, we need two H⁺, so two moles of HCl are needed per mole of Ca(OH)₂.

So the balanced equation is Ca(OH)₂ + 2 HCl → CaCl₂ + 2 H₂O.

So from the equation, 1 mole of Ca(OH)₂ reacts with 2 moles of HCl.

So the moles of HCl needed would be 2 * moles of Ca(OH)₂. We have 0.02 moles of Ca(OH)₂, so HCl needed is 0.04 moles.

But wait, the HCl is given in Normality (N). I think Normality is related to equivalents. For HCl, which is a strong acid, each mole gives one equivalent (since it donates one H+ per molecule). So the Normality (N) is the same as molarity (M) for HCl because it's a monoprotic acid. So 0.125 N HCl is the same as 0.125 M HCl.

Wait, but wait, in the reaction, each mole of HCl provides one equivalent because it's a 1:1 ratio for H+.

So, the number of equivalents of HCl needed is 0.04 moles, as we calculated (since 0.02 moles Ca(OH)₂ * 2 = 0.04 equivalents).

The formula to find the volume is: Volume (L) = equivalents / Normality.

So, Volume = 0.04 equivalents / 0.125 N.

Let me compute that. 0.04 divided by 0.125 equals... 0.04 / 0.125 = 0.32 liters. Because 0.125 times 0.32 is 0.04. So 0.32 liters is 320 milliliters.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps.

1. Molar mass of Ca(OH)₂: Ca is 40.08, each OH is 17, so 40.08 + 2*(16 + 1) = 40.08 + 34 = 74.08 g/mol. Correct.

2. Moles of Ca(OH)₂ = 1.48 g /74.08 g/mol ≈ 0.02 moles. Correct.

3. Reaction equation: 1 Ca(OH)₂ : 2 HCl. So moles HCl needed = 2 * 0.02 = 0.04. Correct.

4. Normality of HCl is 0.125 N, which is same as molarity because each HCl gives one H+.

5. Volume = 0.04 eq / 0.125 N = 0.32 L = 320 ml.

Looking at the options, option J is 320 ml. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but wait a moment. Another way to approach this is using the concept of equivalent weight.

The equivalent weight of Ca(OH)₂: since it's a base, it can accept two H+ ions (because each OH- can donate one, but in neutralization, each OH- reacts with one H+). Wait, no, wait. For a base, the equivalent weight is the molar mass divided by the number of OH- groups it can neutralize. So Ca(OH)₂ has two OH- ions, so for each mole, it can neutralize two H+ ions. So equivalent weight = molar mass / 2.

So equivalent weight of Ca(OH)₂ = 74.08 g/mol / 2 = 37.04 g/eq.

Then, the mass given is 1.48 g. So the number of equivalents in Ca(OH)₂ is mass / equivalent weight = 1.48 g / 37.04 g/eq ≈ 0.04 equivalents. Which matches what I had before.

Then, the HCl is 0.125 N, so 0.125 eq per liter. To find the volume, it's equivalents / N = 0.04 / 0.125 = 0.32 L = 320 ml. So same result.

So yeah, 320 ml, which is option J.

To determine how many milliliters of 0.125 N HCl solution are required to neutralize 1.48 g of Ca(OH)₂, the following steps were taken:

1. **Calculate the molar mass of Ca(OH)₂**:  
   - Calcium (Ca) = 40.08 g/mol  
   - Hydroxide (OH) = 17 g/mol (1 hydrogen and 1 oxygen)  
   - Total molar mass of Ca(OH)₂ = 40.08 + 2(17) = 74.08 g/mol  

2. **Determine the moles of Ca(OH)₂**:  
   - Moles = mass / molar mass = 1.48 g / 74.08 g/mol ≈ 0.02 moles  

3. **Write the balanced reaction**:  
   - Ca(OH)₂ + 2 HCl → CaCl₂ + 2 H₂O  
   - From the equation, 1 mole of Ca(OH)₂ reacts with 2 moles of HCl.  

4. **Calculate the moles of HCl required**:  
   - Moles of HCl = 2 × moles of Ca(OH)₂ = 2 × 0.02 = 0.04 moles  

5. **Relate Normality (N) to molarity (M)**:  
   - For HCl, a monoprotic acid, Normality (N) is equivalent to molarity (M). Thus, 0.125 N HCl = 0.125 M HCl.  

6. **Calculate the volume of HCl solution required**:  
   - Volume (L) = moles / Normality = 0.04 moles / 0.125 N = 0.32 L  
   - Convert to milliliters: 0.32 L × 1000 mL/L = 320 mL  

7. **Verify the result**:  
   - Using equivalent weight and Normality, the same result (320 mL) was obtained, confirming the calculation.  

Thus, the volume of 0.125 N HCl required to neutralize the calcium hydroxide solution is **320 mL**.
