Okay, so I'm trying to solve this thyristor question. Hmm, I remember that a thyristor has something to do with latching current and holding current. Wait, I think the latching current is the minimum current needed to turn the thyristor on, right? And the holding current is the minimum current needed to keep it conducting once it's on. 

So the question says the holding current is 2 mA. Wait, wait—wait, no, wait. No, hold on. Because usually, the latching current is higher than the holding current. Because once you trigger it with the latching current, it stays on with a lower holding current. So if the holding is 2 mA, the latching must be higher than that. 

Wait, but the options given are all lower than 2 mA except for option C which is 0.01 A, which is 10 mA. Oh, wait no, 0.01 A is 10 mA, and 2 mA is 0.002 A. So wait, the question is phrased as: "If holding current of a thyristor is 2 mA then latching current should be..." So the options are A: 0.001 (1 mA), B: 0.004 (4 mA), C: 0.01 (10 mA), D: 0.002 (2 mA). 

Wait, but I thought latching current is higher than holding. So if holding is 2 mA, then latching should be higher than that. Looking at the options, option B is 4 mA, which is higher than 2. Option C is 10 mA, which is even higher. So why would the answer be one of them?

Wait, maybe I'm getting this backwards. Oh wait, some sources say that the holding current is the minimum current needed to maintain conduction. The latching current is the minimum current pulse needed to trigger the thyristor into conduction. So typically, the latching current is higher than the holding current. 

So if the holding is 2 mA, the latching must be higher. So looking at the options, which are higher than 2 mA? Let's see: options A is 1 mA (lower), B is 4 mA (higher), C is 10 mA (higher), D is 2 mA (same). So the latching current is higher than holding, so the answer should be either B or C.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes I've heard that the latching current is just a bit higher than the holding. Like, maybe in the same range. So 2 mA holding, so maybe latching is 4 mA, which is option B. Or could it be the same as holding? No, that doesn't make sense because then D would be the same. 

Wait, but looking at some data sheets, I think the latching current is often in the range of tens of mA, but maybe not. Wait, if the holding is 2 mA, then the latching could be, say, 4 mA. So option B would make sense. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is reversed. Wait, no—the question says that the holding is 2 mA, so latching must be higher. So the correct answer would be either B or C. But looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is B:0.004 A, which is 4 mA.

Wait, but wait another thought: sometimes the latching current is specified as the minimum current needed to trigger the device. So if the holding current is 2 mA, then the latching current would be about 2 to 5 times higher. So 2 mA holding, latching could be 4 mA, which is option B.

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the terms. Oh wait, sometimes the latching current is also called the trigger current. So for a thyristor, the gate trigger current is usually lower, but the anode current needed to latch is higher. So, for example, if the holding current is 2 mA, the latching current might be 5 mA or something. But the options don't have 5 mA, so the closest higher is option B (4 mA) or C (10 mA). 

Another approach: I remember that the latching current is typically in the range of 3-5 times the holding current. So if holding is 2 mA (0.002 A), then latching would be around 6-10 mA. So 0.006 to 0.01 A. Looking at the options, option C is 0.01 A, which is 10 mA, which would fit into that range. So maybe the correct answer is C. 

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Some sources might state different ratios. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects a direct relation where latching is twice the holding. So 2 mA holding would mean 4 mA latching, which is option B.

Hmm. Now I'm a bit confused. But I think the more accurate approach is that latching is higher, so either B or C. Given that, looking at the possible standard values, perhaps the answer is B: 0.004 A, which is 4 mA.

The question asks about the relationship between the holding current and the latching current of a thyristor. The holding current is the minimum current required to maintain conduction, while the latching current is the minimum current required to trigger the thyristor into conduction. Typically, the latching current is higher than the holding current.

Given that the holding current is specified as 2 mA (0.002 A), the latching current must be higher than this value. Among the options provided:

- **A: 0.001 A (1 mA)** is lower than the holding current and therefore incorrect.
- **B: 0.004 A (4 mA)** is higher than the holding current and could be a reasonable value for the latching current.
- **C: 0.01 A (10 mA)** is significantly higher than the holding current and also a plausible value for the latching current.
- **D: 0.002 A (2 mA)** is equal to the holding current and does not satisfy the requirement that the latching current must be higher.

While the latching current is typically 3–5 times the holding current, the exact value can vary. Based on the options, **B: 0.004 A (4 mA)** is the most reasonable choice, as it is a common and practical value for the latching current when the holding current is 2 mA.

Answer: B
