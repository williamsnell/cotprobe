Okay, so I've got this problem here about J. S. Bacq & Co.'s penny arcade. Hmm, let me read it carefully. Alright, so they have some fixed costs and some variable costs, and they want to make a certain profit each week. I need to find out how many people need to visit weekly for them to reach that profit.

Let's break down the information. Fixed costs are things that don't change with the number of customers, right? So, the fixed costs are wages and electricity at $500 per week, and upkeep and miscellaneous at $100 per week. So adding those together, that's $500 + $100 = $600 per week in fixed costs.

Then there's the variable cost, which is the surprise gift each customer gets. Each gift costs $2.00. So for each customer, the arcade spends $2 on the gift. That's a variable cost because it depends on the number of customers.

The charge for admission is $6.00 per person. So each customer brings in $6 in revenue. But wait, the gift costs $2, so the net gain per customer after considering the gift would be $6 - $2 = $4 per customer. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the $6 is the income, and the $2 is a cost. So for each customer, the contribution to covering fixed costs and profit would be $6 (revenue) minus $2 (variable cost) which equals $4 per customer.

But wait, the problem says the sole charge is for admission. So the $6 is the only charge, and the gifts are a cost. So the profit per customer is indeed $6 - $2 = $4.

Now, the management wants a profit of $1,000 each week. Profit is calculated as total revenue minus all costs (fixed and variable). So the formula would be:

Profit = (Number of customers × Admission price) - (Fixed costs + Variable costs)

But variable costs are per customer, so that's Number of customers × $2.

Alternatively, using contribution margin approach: Each customer contributes $4 towards fixed costs and profit. So the break-even point is when total contribution equals fixed costs, but here they want a target profit.

So let's set up the equation. Let’s let x be the number of customers.

Total Revenue = 6x
Total Variable Cost = 2x
Fixed Costs = 600

Profit = Total Revenue - (Fixed + Variable) = 6x - (600 + 2x) = 4x - 600

They want this profit to be $1,000. So:

4x - 600 = 1000

Adding 600 to both sides:

4x = 1600

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 400

So they need 400 customers a week.

Looking at the options, option J is 400 customers. So the answer should be J.

To determine how many customers J. S. Bacq & Co. needs weekly to achieve a $1,000 profit, we analyze the fixed and variable costs alongside the revenue generated per customer.

**Fixed Costs:**
- Wages and electricity: $500/week
- Upkeep and miscellaneous: $100/week  
**Total Fixed Costs = $500 + $100 = $600/week**

**Variable Costs:**
- Each customer receives a gift costing $2.  
**Variable Cost per Customer = $2**

**Revenue:**
- Admission charge per customer: $6.  
**Revenue per Customer = $6**

**Profit Equation:**
Profit = (Revenue per Customer × Number of Customers) - (Fixed Costs + Variable Costs per Customer × Number of Customers)  
Let \( x \) = Number of Customers.  
Profit = \( 6x - (600 + 2x) = 4x - 600 \)

**Target Profit:**
Management aims for a weekly profit of $1,000.  
\[
4x - 600 = 1000
\]
\[
4x = 1600
\]
\[
x = 400
\]

Thus, **400 customers** are required weekly to achieve the desired profit. From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**J: Four hundred customers**
