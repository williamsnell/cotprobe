Question:

Suppose that the alleles for eye color for a certain male fruit fly are $(R, W)$ and the alleles for eye color for the mating female fruit fly are $(R, W)$, where $R$ and $W$ represent red and white, respectively. Their offspring receive one allele for eye color from each parent. Assume that each of the four possible outcomes has equal probability. If an offspring ends up with either two white alleles or one red and one white allele for eye color, its eyes will look white. Given that an offspring's eyes look white, what is the conditional probability that it has two white alleles for eye color?

Options:

A: $\frac{1}{3}$
B: $\frac{4}{5}$
C: $\frac{1}{5}$
D: $\frac{1}{4}$
E: $\frac{2}{5}$
F: $\frac{1}{2}$
G: $\frac{3}{4}$
H: $\frac{5}{6}$

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this probability question about fruit flies and their eye color alleles. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly.

The setup is that both parents are fruit flies with alleles for eye color (R, W). So the male has R and W, and the female also has R and W. Their offspring get one allele from each parent. Each of the four possible outcomes is equally probable. 

Wait, the four possible outcomes—oh right, because each parent can contribute either R or W. So the possible combinations for the offspring would be RR, RW, WR, and WW. But wait, RW and WR are the same in terms of genotype, right? Or does the order matter here? Hmm, the problem says each of the four possible outcomes has equal probability. So I guess each is considered distinct, but in reality, for the genotype, RW and WR are the same. But maybe for the sake of this problem, we treat each as a separate outcome.

The question is about conditional probability. It says that if an offspring has white eyes, what's the probability it has two white alleles (i.e., WW genotype). Because, according to the problem, an offspring will have white eyes if it has either two white alleles (WW) or one red and one white (RW or WR). So the phenotype is white in both WW and RW cases.

So the first thing I need to figure out is all the possible genotypes of the offspring and their probabilities. Let's think about the Punnett square for these parents.

The male can contribute R or W, each with 50% chance. The female can contribute R or W, also 50% each. So when we cross them, the possible combinations are:

- Male R and female R: RR
- Male R and female W: RW
- Male W and female R: WR
- Male W and female W: WW

Each of these four outcomes is equally likely, so each has a probability of 25% (1/4). 

Now, the next part is about the phenotype. The problem states that any offspring with WW or RW or WR will have white eyes. Wait, no—actually, the problem says that if the offspring has two white alleles (WW) or one red and one white (RW or WR), the eyes look white. So that's the condition for white eyes.

Wait, but in reality, for many traits, like human eye color, two different alleles might result in a blended phenotype, but in this case, the problem tells us that any combination other than RR will look white. Because, according to the problem statement, only RR would have red eyes, and all others (WW, RW, WR) have white eyes. Oh wait, no, the problem says that if the offspring has two white alleles (WW) or one R and one W (RW or WR), then the eyes look white. So that means that the only way to have red eyes is to have RR, because that's the only other possibility. So the possible genotypes are RR, RW, WR, WW, each with 1/4 probability.

But wait, RW and WR are two distinct outcomes in the Punnett square, so in reality, the probability of RW and WR are each 1/4, but as phenotypes, they're the same.

So the question is, given that the offspring has white eyes, what's the probability that its genotype is WW.

So this is a conditional probability problem. We can model it using Bayes' theorem or by considering the favorable cases over the total possible cases under the condition.

The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B).

In this case, event A is "the offspring has genotype WW", and event B is "the offspring has white eyes".

So P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B). But since if A occurs, B must occur (because having WW means white eyes), P(A and B) is just P(A). So we can write it as P(A) / P(B).

First, let's find P(B), the probability that the offspring has white eyes. As per the problem, this includes all cases except RR. So looking at the Punnett square, the possible outcomes are four: RR, RW, WR, WW. Each with 1/4 probability.

Out of these four, the ones with white eyes are RW, WR, and WW. So three out of four cases. So P(B) = 3/4.

P(A) is the probability of having genotype WW, which is 1/4.

Wait wait, no. Wait, each of the four outcomes (RR, RW, WR, WW) has 1/4 probability. So the probability of WW is 1/4. But when we condition on B (white eyes), the possible outcomes are RW, WR, and WW. So each of these three outcomes has equal probability within B. But wait, the original probabilities are each 1/4, so the total P(B) is 3/4.

So the conditional probability P(A|B) is the probability that the outcome is WW given that it's either RW, WR, or WW. 

So each of these three cases (RW, WR, WW) has a probability of 1/4 each. So the total P(B) is 3*(1/4) = 3/4.

So the conditional probability is (1/4) divided by (3/4) = 1/3.

So the answer should be 1/3, which is option A.

Wait, let me double-check. Another approach: list all possible outcomes that result in white eyes.

The four possible genotypes are RR (probability 1/4), RW (1/4), WR (1/4), and WW (1/4). The ones with white eyes are RW, WR, WW. So three possibilities, each with 1/4 chance. So P(B) is 3/4.

Of these, only one is WW, which is 1/4. So the conditional probability is (1/4) / (3/4) = 1/3.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer is A: 1/3.

To solve the problem, we first determine the possible genotypes of the offspring and their probabilities. Since both parents have the genotype (R, W), the possible offspring genotypes are RR, RW, WR, and WW, each with equal probability of 1/4.

The problem specifies that an offspring will have white eyes if its genotype is WW, RW, or WR. This means the condition for white eyes (event B) includes three outcomes: RW, WR, and WW. The probability of white eyes, P(B), is therefore:

\[
P(B) = P(RW) + P(WR) + P(WW) = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}.
\]

Next, we calculate the probability that the offspring has the genotype WW (event A) given that it has white eyes (event B). The probability of having genotype WW is:

\[
P(A) = P(WW) = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

The conditional probability \( P(A|B) \) is given by:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}.
\]

Since having genotype WW automatically satisfies the condition of having white eyes, \( P(A \cap B) = P(A) = \frac{1}{4} \). Substituting the values:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Thus, the conditional probability that an offspring with white eyes has two white alleles (WW) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

The correct answer is **A: \(\frac{1}{3}\)**.
