Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about types of non-random samples. Hmm, I remember that in statistics, sampling methods are categorized into random (probability) and non-random (non-probability) samples. 

The question is asking which of the options are non-random. Let me think about each type of sample.

First, let me recall the different sampling methods. Random samples include things like simple random sampling, stratified sampling, cluster sampling, and systematic sampling. Wait, no, actually, I think some of these are considered probability sampling methods. So stratified, cluster, and systematic are all types of probability (random) sampling. So they're not non-random.

Non-random samples, on the other hand, include methods like convenience sampling, quota sampling, and maybe snowball sampling. These are methods where the selection isn't based on random chance, so they might introduce more bias.

Looking at the options, the question is about non-random samples, so the correct options should include non-probability methods.

Option A: Random and quota. No, because random is a probability method, so this can't be right.

Option B: Cluster and systematic. Both of these are probability methods, so they're random, not non-random. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Stratified and random. Both are probability, so not non-random. C is wrong.

Option D: Random and systematic. Again, both are probability. Not the answer.

Option E: Random and cluster. Both are random. So E is out.

Option F: Systematic and quota. Wait, systematic is a probability method. So F includes one non-random (quota) and one random. So that's a mix, but the question is about non-random types. So F is incorrect because it includes systematic, which is random.

Option G: Stratified and quota. Stratified is random, quota is non-random. Again, a mix, so G isn't the right answer.

Option H: Convenience and quota. Both are non-random. Oh, that fits. Convenience sampling is when you take participants as they're available. Quota sampling involves selecting people to fit certain criteria until you reach a set number in each category. Neither uses random selection, so both are non-random.

Option I: Stratified and convenience. Stratified is random, so that's a mix. I is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be H: Convenience and quota samples.

The question asks about types of non-random (non-probability) samples. Non-random sampling methods include convenience sampling and quota sampling, as they do not rely on random selection. Other methods like stratified, cluster, and systematic sampling are considered probability sampling methods and are therefore random. 

Analyzing the options:

- **H: Convenience and quota samples** correctly identifies two non-random methods.
- Other options either include random sampling methods or a mix of random and non-random methods.

Thus, the correct answer is:

H
