Okay, so I need to figure out Janet's profit from this stock option she bought. Let's go through this step by step.

First, she bought an option for $175. I remember that an option gives the buyer the right to purchase a stock at a certain price within a specific time. So this option allows her to buy 100 shares at 14 and a half dollars each. Wait, 14(1/2) means $14.50 per share, right?

So the strike price is $14.50 per share for 100 shares. But wait, she paid $175 for the option itself. That's the cost of the option, not the cost of the shares yet.

Then, one month later, she exercised her option. Exercising means she buys the 100 shares at the strike price. So she pays 100 shares * $14.50 per share. Let me calculate that: 100 * 14.50 is $1450. So she spends $1450 to buy the shares.

On the same day she exercises the option, she sells the stock for $17 per share. So she sells all 100 shares at $17 each. 100 * 17 = $1700. That's the revenue she gets from selling.

Now, to find her profit, I need to subtract her total costs from her total revenue. Her costs include the price she paid for the option and the cost of buying the shares. So total cost is $175 (option) + $1450 (shares) = $1625.

Her revenue is $1700 from selling the shares. So profit is revenue minus total cost: $1700 - $1625 = $75.

Wait, let me double-check that. So, she spent $175 for the option, then spent $1450 to buy the shares, totaling $1625. Then she sold them for $1700. So 1700 minus 1625 is indeed 75. So her profit is $75.

Looking at the options, option H is $75. So the answer should be H.

To determine Janet's profit, we need to calculate her total costs and total revenue from the transaction.

1. **Cost of the Option**: Janet paid $175 for the option to buy 100 shares at $14.50 each.  
2. **Cost of Exercising the Option**: When she exercised the option, she bought 100 shares at $14.50 per share.  
   \[
   100 \times 14.50 = \$1450
   \]  
   Therefore, her total cost is:  
   \[
   \$175 + \$1450 = \$1625
   \]  

3. **Revenue from Selling the Stock**: On the same day, Janet sold the 100 shares at $17 per share.  
   \[
   100 \times 17 = \$1700
   \]  

4. **Profit Calculation**: Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost:  
   \[
   \$1700 - \$1625 = \$75
   \]  

Thus, Janet's profit on the stock is **$75**. The correct answer is **H**.  

H
