Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Gunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China
In Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.
What traditional view of world history does this passage seem to challenge?

Options:

A: That China has always been less technologically adept than most Afro-Eurasian societies
B: That China's rigid form of dictatorial rule suppressed any spirit of military or technological innovation
C: That China was hindered by religious fundamentalism when it came to modernizing efforts
D: That China was surpassed by Europe in global power because it turned a blind eye to the obvious benefits of technological change

Okay, so I have this history question to answer, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about a passage discussing gunpowder weaponry in Europe versus China during certain periods. Let me read the passage again to make sure I understand.

The passage says that in Western Europe, from the 1200s to 1400s, early cannons were heavy and slow but still useful in sieges. So governments there found it worthwhile to invest in them and in research to make better, more powerful and mobile gunpowder weapons. On the other hand, China, especially after the mid-1300s, faced threats mainly from mobile steppe nomads. Early gunpowder weapons weren't useful against them because they were unwieldy. So China focused on improving horse archer units instead.

The question is asking which traditional view of world history this passage challenges. The options are A to D.

I think the passage is contrasting Europe's and China's approaches to military technology. Europe kept developing gunpowder weapons, which eventually became more advanced, while China didn't because their enemies were different. So the traditional view being challenged here must relate to why Europe surpassed China in certain technologies or global influence.

Looking at the options:

A: That China has always been less technologically adept than most Afro-Eurasian societies. The passage actually doesn't say that. It shows that China did have gunpowder but chose not to develop it further because it wasn't needed against their specific threats. So this traditional view is being challenged because China wasn't less adept, they just focused elsewhere.

B: That China's rigid dictatorial rule suppressed innovation. The passage doesn't talk about the political system or rulers suppressing anything. It's more about the strategic focus based on enemies, so B might not be the answer.

C: That China was hindered by religious fundamentalism. The passage doesn't mention religion at all, so C is probably not it.

D: That China was surpassed by Europe because it ignored technological change. The passage suggests that China didn't ignore it; they just had different priorities because their threats required different solutions. So this challenges the view that China didn't care about tech changes, which is option D.

Wait, let me think again. The traditional view in D says China turned a blind eye to the obvious benefits. But in reality, China made a deliberate choice based on their military needs, not that they ignored benefits. So the passage is challenging the idea that China was surpassed because they didn't adapt technology, when actually they had different strategic focuses.

So the answer should be D because the passage shows China didn't ignore technological change but adapted based on their specific threats, unlike the traditional view that Europe just was better at it.

The passage challenges the traditional view that China was surpassed by Europe in global power because it ignored technological change. Instead, it shows that China made strategic choices based on specific threats, focusing on horse archers rather than gunpowder weapons, which were less effective against mobile nomads. This directly contradicts the notion that China turned a blind eye to technological benefits.

Answer: D
