Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

In a criminal prosecution the government must prove that the defendant affixed a rubber-stamp containing his signature to certain fraudulent letters mailed to the victim. The defendant denied that he stamped the letters. There were no witnesses to the defendant stamping the letters. The prosecution attempted to present a co-worker to testify that defendant maintained sole control of the stamp and used it once daily at 3 p.m. to sign all outgoing letters, and then immediately returned it to his safe. The co-worker would testify that he saw the defendant using the stamp in that habitual manner over a period of many years. The defense objected because this did not prove that the defendant's practice was followed on the dates in question. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, what will the court rule?

Options:

A: The testimony is inadmissible because evidence of prior habit will only distract the jury from deciding whether the defendant actually acted that way on the specified dates.
B: The testimony is inadmissible because it is not direct evidence that the defendant used the stamp on the fraudulent letters.
C: The testimony is inadmissible because the co-worker does not have a direct knowledge of the defendant using the stamp on the fraudulent letters.
D: The testimony is inadmissible because evidence of habit is not admissible in a criminal case under the Federal Rules of Evidence.
E: The testimony is admissible because it proves that the defendant had access to the stamp.
F: The testimony is admissible because it proves a pattern of behavior that the defendant maintained control over the stamp.
G: The testimony is admissible because it proves that the defendant was the only person who could have used the stamp.
H: The testimony is inadmissible because the co-worker's observation is considered hearsay under the Federal Rules of Evidence.
I: The testimony is admissible because habit and routine practice are admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence.
J: The testimony is admissible because it provides the jury with information about the defendant's routine, which is relevant to the case.

Okay, so I've got this evidence question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's start breaking it down.

The question is about whether certain testimony is admissible in a criminal prosecution. The defendant is accused of using a rubber stamp with his signature on fraudulent letters. He denied doing it, and there are no witnesses to him actually stamping those letters. The prosecution wants a co-worker to testify about the defendant's habit of using the stamp daily at 3 p.m., keeping it in a safe, and that the co-worker saw this happen over many years. The defense objects, saying this doesn't prove he followed the habit on the specific dates.

I remember that evidence law has specific rules about habit and routine. So I'm thinking about the Federal Rules of Evidence, particularly Rule 406, which deals with habit and routine practice. From what I recall, habit is defined as a regular practice of a person, and routine practice is about how an organization usually does things.

In this case, the co-worker is testifying about the defendant's daily routine with the stamp. The defense argues that this doesn't prove he did it on the specific dates, but the prosecution is using it to show that he had control and access to the stamp, which is relevant.

I think habit evidence is admissible to prove that a person acted in a certain way on a specific occasion. So if the defendant always used the stamp at 3 p.m. and kept it in a safe, that could suggest that it's likely he used it on those dates too, especially if no one else had access.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's inadmissible because it distracts the jury. But I don't think that's a valid reason under the rules. The rules focus more on relevance and whether it's barred by a specific rule, not just because it's distracting.

Option B says it's not direct evidence. That's true, but habit evidence is indirect. However, it's still admissible under Rule 406 to show conduct on a particular occasion.

Option C claims the co-worker lacks direct knowledge. But the co-worker is testifying about what he's observed over years, so he does have knowledge of the habit.

Option D says evidence of habit isn't allowed in criminal cases. That's not correct because habit can be used in criminal cases if it's relevant, like proving opportunity or method.

Option E suggests it's admissible because it shows access. While that's part of it, the main point is about the habit showing he likely used it on those dates.

Option F says it's about a pattern showing control. That makes sense because the testimony shows he had sole control, which is relevant to whether he used it.

Option G claims the defendant was the only one who could have used it. That's a bit strong, but the testimony does indicate he maintained sole control.

Option H says it's hearsay. But habit evidence isn't hearsay because it's about the witness's own observations of the person's behavior over time.

Option I states that habit and routine are admissible. Yes, under Rule 406, habit evidence is admissible to prove conduct on a specific occasion.

Option J says it provides info about routine, which is relevant. That's correct, but I think the more precise reason is under Rule 406.

Putting it all together, the co-worker's testimony is about a regular habit, which is admissible under Rule 406 to show that the defendant likely used the stamp on the dates in question. So the court should allow this testimony because it's relevant and fits the rules on habit evidence.

So the correct answer should be either F, I, or J. Between them, I think F and J are about routine and pattern. But the best fit is probably F because it's about the pattern showing control, which is directly relevant. Alternatively, I because it's about habit being admissible.

Wait, looking back, the question is about whether the testimony is admissible. The key issue is whether habit evidence can be used for this purpose. So I think the correct answer is I because it directly addresses that habit is admissible under the rules. So the testimony is admissible because habit and routine are admissible.

Wait, but option F says it's admissible because it shows a pattern of control. That's also a good point. However, the rule specifically allows habit evidence to prove conduct. So the main reason for admissibility is that habit is allowed, making option I correct.

Alternatively, maybe F is correct because it's about a routine practice. Hmm. Rule 406 covers both habit of a person and routine practice of an organization. In this case, the testimony is about the defendant's personal habit, so it's habit evidence.

So the testimony is admissible because habit is admissible. So the answer is I.
</think>

The question revolves around the admissibility of testimony regarding the defendant's habit of using a rubber stamp, under the Federal Rules of Evidence. The prosecution seeks to introduce evidence of the defendant's daily routine of using the stamp at 3 p.m. and securing it in a safe, observed over many years, to infer that he likely used it on the dates in question. The defense objects, arguing that this does not prove the habit was followed on the specific dates.

Under Federal Rule of Evidence 406, habit evidence is admissible to prove that a person acted in a particular way on a specific occasion. Here, the co-worker's testimony about the defendant's consistent routine demonstrates a regular practice, which is relevant to show that the defendant likely used the stamp on the dates in question. This evidence is not hearsay, as it is based on the co-worker's personal observations. While the testimony does not provide direct evidence, it is admissible as indirect evidence under Rule 406 to establish the defendant's likely conduct.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, C, D, H**: These are incorrect because they misstate the applicability of habit evidence or confuse it with other evidentiary issues.
- **E, G**: While partially relevant, these options do not capture the full scope of why the testimony is admissible under Rule 406.
- **F, J**: These options are close, as they address the relevance of the routine and pattern of behavior, but they do not explicitly tie the admissibility to Rule 406.
- **I**: This is the most accurate option, as it directly states that habit and routine practice are admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence, aligning with Rule 406.

Thus, the testimony is admissible because habit and routine practice evidence is explicitly allowed under the Federal Rules of Evidence.
