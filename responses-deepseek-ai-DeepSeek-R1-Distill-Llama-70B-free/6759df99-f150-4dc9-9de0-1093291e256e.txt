Alright, so I've got this question here about psychology theories. The question is asking about the equation Performance = Expectation × Value and which theorist and school of thought it comes from. The options are A through J, each pairing a theorist with a theory.

Okay, let's break this down. I remember that in psychology, there are several theories related to motivation and behavior. The equation given looks like it's about how performance is the product of expectation and value. That makes me think of something related to motivation or maybe learning theories.

So, let's go through the options one by one. 

Option A: Jean Piaget and Cognitive Development Theory. Piaget is known for his stages of cognitive development, like sensorimotor, preoperational, etc. Doesn't seem related to this equation.

Option B: Abraham Maslow and Hierarchy of Needs. Maslow's theory is about different levels of needs, from physiological to self-actualization. I don't recall an equation like this from him. He's more about the hierarchy pyramid.

Option C: Edward Tolman and Expectancy-Value Theory. Hmm, that sounds familiar. I think Tolman was a behaviorist who talked about expectancy and reinforcement. He proposed that behavior is influenced by the expectation of a certain outcome and the value of that outcome. So Performance = Expectation × Value might be his formula.

Option D: Ivan Pavlov and Classical Conditioning. Pavlov is known for his work on classical conditioning, like dogs salivating when they hear a bell. His work is more about associative learning, not about performance equations.

Option E: Carl Rogers and Humanistic Theory. Rogers focused on person-centered approaches, emphasizing self-actualization and empathy. No equation like that comes to mind here.

Option F: Clark Hull and Reinforcement Theory. Hull did work on drive-reduction theory and had some equations related to behavior, like the equation for behavior potential. I think he might have used something like B = f(Habit × Drive). But I'm not sure if it's exactly this equation.

Option G: Albert Bandura and Social Learning Theory. Bandura is known for the Bobo doll experiment and the concept of self-efficacy. His theory involves observation and imitation, but I don't think he used this specific equation.

Option H: John Watson and Behaviorism. Watson was a founder of behaviorism, focusing on observable behaviors. Not sure about an equation like this.

Option I: B.F. Skinner and Operant Conditioning. Skinner is all about operant conditioning, using reinforcement and punishment to shape behavior. His work is more about schedules of reinforcement and not an equation involving expectation and value.

Option J: Sigmund Freud and Psychoanalytic Theory. Freud's work is about the unconscious mind, id, ego, superego. Definitely not related to this equation.

Wait, so going back. I think the equation is from Expectancy Theory, which is about motivation. There's Victor Vroom's Expectancy Theory, but he's not one of the options. Wait, but the options have Edward Tolman. So maybe Tolman's theory is the one. Or perhaps it's related to Clark Hull.

Another thought: Hull's equation was B = H × D × V, where H is habit, D is drive, and V is incentive. That's not exactly the same as the given equation. Wait, the given equation is Performance = Expectation × Value. So maybe it's Expectancy-Value Theory, which I think is attributed to someone else.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Expectancy-Value Theory is often associated with motivation. Victor Vroom developed the Expectancy Theory, which states that motivation is a function of valence, instrumentality, and expectancy. But Vroom isn't an option here.

Wait, the options have Edward Tolman. Tolman was a behavioral psychologist who talked about cognitive maps and purposive behavior. His work included the concept of expectancy and reinforcement. So perhaps the equation comes from him.

Alternatively, there's another theory called the Expectancy-Value Theory, which is sometimes linked to Tolman. So maybe the correct answer is C: Edward Tolman and Expectancy-Value Theory.

Wait, but I'm trying to remember. Another angle: Clark Hull's equation was more about the combination of habit, drive, and incentive. So not the same as expectation multiplied by value.

So putting it all together, the equation Performance = Expectation × Value seems to align with Expectancy-Value Theory, which is attributed to Edward Tolman. So the answer should be option C.
</think>

The equation **Performance = Expectation × Value** is associated with **Edward Tolman** and his **Expectancy-Value Theory**. Tolman, a behavioral psychologist, introduced this theory to explain how behavior is motivated by the expectation of a certain outcome and the value assigned to that outcome. This aligns with his work on purposive behavior and cognitive maps, which emphasize the role of expectations and incentives in guiding behavior.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Jean Piaget's Cognitive Development Theory focuses on stages of cognitive growth, unrelated to this equation.  
- **B**: Abraham Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs involves a pyramid of needs, not an equation.  
- **C**: Edward Tolman's Expectancy-Value Theory directly relates to the equation, as it explains behavior in terms of expectation and value.  
- **D**: Ivan Pavlov's Classical Conditioning deals with associative learning, not performance equations.  
- **E**: Carl Rogers' Humanistic Theory emphasizes self-actualization, not mathematical models of performance.  
- **F**: Clark Hull's Drive-Reduction Theory involves habit, drive, and incentive, not exactly this equation.  
- **G**: Albert Bandura's Social Learning Theory focuses on observation and imitation, unrelated to this equation.  
- **H**: John Watson's Behaviorism is about observable behaviors, not this specific equation.  
- **I**: B.F. Skinner's Operant Conditioning involves reinforcement, not this equation.  
- **J**: Sigmund Freud's Psychoanalytic Theory explores the unconscious mind, unrelated to this equation.  

Thus, the correct answer is **C: Edward Tolman and Expectancy-Value Theory**.
