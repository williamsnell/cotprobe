Okay, so I've got this question about whether certain substances behave as ideal gases under given conditions. Hmm, I remember that the ideal gas law is a good approximation when the gas is under low pressure and high temperature, so that the molecules are far apart and don't interact much. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact criteria, so I'll have to think carefully.

The question has three parts: a, b, and c. Let's tackle them one by one.

Starting with part a: Oxygen at 30°C and 1.0 MPa. Wait, 30°C is 303 K, which is pretty warm. Pressure is 1.0 MPa, which is 10 bar. Oh, right, atmospheric pressure is about 0.1 MPa, so this is 10 times higher. I think high pressure might make the gas deviate from ideal behavior because the molecules are closer together. But wait, oxygen is a diatomic gas, and maybe at high temps it's more ideal. I'm not sure about the specific conditions here. I recall that the critical point is important. The critical temperature of oxygen is around 118 K (-155°C), so at 30°C, which is way above the critical temp, the gas should behave more ideally. But wait, high pressure... Oh, right, even if the temperature is above critical, high pressure can cause the gas to not behave ideally. So maybe oxygen under 10 MPa doesn't follow ideal gas law. But I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps for the given conditions, oxygen is a gas and whether it's ideal depends on the reduced pressure and temperature.

Wait, there's the concept of the compressibility factor Z. If Z is close to 1, the gas behaves ideally. The compressibility factor is calculated using the reduced pressure (P/Pc) and reduced temperature (T/Tc). So, for oxygen, what's Pc and Tc? Oxygen's critical temp is about 118 K, and critical pressure is around 5.08 MPa. So, for part a, the pressure is 1.0 MPa, which is roughly P/Pc = 1/5.08 ≈ 0.197. The temperature is 303 K, so T/Tc is about 303/118 ≈ 2.57. So, with Pr around 0.2 and Tr around 2.57. Looking at the compressibility chart, I think that's on the right side, where Z is pretty close to 1. So maybe oxygen behaves ideally here. So a is reasonable.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. At higher pressures, even if above the critical temp, perhaps the gas is not ideal. But given that the pressure is only 10% of the critical pressure, and temp is well above, maybe it's okay. So I'll tentatively say a is reasonable.

Moving to part b: Nitrogen at -100°C and 10 MPa. Oh wow, that's really cold. Let me check the critical points. Nitrogen's critical temp is about 126 K, which is -147°C. So -100°C is 173 K, which is above the critical temp (since 173 K > 126 K). So, above critical temp, the gas can't be liquefied, so it's a gas. But the pressure is 10 MPa. Let's compute the reduced parameters. Critical pressure for nitrogen is about 3.39 MPa. So P =10 MPa, so Pr =10/3.39 ≈ 2.95. Tr is 173/126 ≈ 1.373. 

Looking at the compressibility chart, when Tr is around 1.37 and Pr is around 3, the Z value is significantly above 1, meaning the gas is more compressible than ideal, so it doesn't behave ideally. So at 10 MPa, even though the temp is above critical, the pressure is high, so nitrogen would not behave as an ideal gas here. So part b is not reasonable.

Wait, but wait. If a gas is above its critical temperature, it can't be liquefied, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's ideal. High pressure can cause significant deviation. So yes, part b probably does not behave ideally. So b is not reasonable.

Part c: Water at 40°C and 10 kPa. 40°C is 313 K. 10 kPa is 0.1 bar, which is much less than atmospheric pressure (which is about 101 kPa). So, water at 40°C and low pressure. Now, water can exist as a gas (steam) here. The question is, does steam behave ideally under these conditions?

Hmm. I remember that steam can be approximated as an ideal gas when it's at high temperatures and low pressures. At 40°C and 10 kPa, which is well below the critical point of water. Wait, what's the critical point of water? Critical temp is 374°C, critical pressure is 22.06 MPa. So at 40°C and 0.01 MPa (10 kPa), we're way below the critical temp. So, the reduced temp is 313 / 647 (since critical temp is 647 K) ≈ 0.48, and reduced pressure is 0.01 MPa / 22.06 MPa ≈ 0.00045. So, very low Pr. At such low pressure, most gases, including steam, tend to behave ideally. So, yes, steam at these conditions would behave as an ideal gas. So part c is reasonable.

Wait, but wait another thing. Water has strong intermolecular forces, especially hydrogen bonding. So even in the gas phase, maybe at lower temps it's not ideal. But 40°C is warm, and the pressure is very low, so the molecules are far apart. So I think the assumption holds. So part c is reasonable.

Now, compiling my conclusions:

a) Oxygen: Reasonable (Yes)
b) Nitrogen: Not reasonable (No)
c) Water: Reasonable (Yes)

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: a yes, b no, c yes. That's what I have.

Option A says a: Reasonable, b: Not reasonable, c: Reasonable. So the correct answer should be A.

Wait, but let me double-check part a. Oxygen at 1 MPa. Wait, 1 MPa is 10 bar. So, 10 bar is not that low. But considering the critical pressure of oxygen is 5.08 MPa, 1 MPa is about 20% of Pc. So the reduced pressure is 0.2, which isn't that high, and the temp is above the critical temp. So maybe it's okay. I think that the ideal gas assumption is reasonable here.

So the correct option is A.

To determine whether the given substances behave as ideal gases under the specified conditions, we analyze each case based on the ideal gas criteria: low pressure, high temperature, and whether the substance is above its critical temperature. Deviations from ideal gas behavior can be assessed using the compressibility factor \( Z \), which depends on the reduced pressure \( P_r = \frac{P}{P_c} \) and reduced temperature \( T_r = \frac{T}{T_c} \). If \( Z \approx 1 \), the gas behaves ideally.

### Analysis of Each Case:

#### a) Oxygen at 30°C (303 K) and 1.0 MPa:
- Critical temperature of oxygen: \( T_c = 118 \, \text{K} \), critical pressure: \( P_c = 5.08 \, \text{MPa} \).
- Reduced temperature: \( T_r = \frac{303}{118} \approx 2.57 \), reduced pressure: \( P_r = \frac{1.0}{5.08} \approx 0.197 \).
- Since \( T_r > 1 \) and \( P_r \) is moderate, oxygen is above its critical temperature and the pressure is not excessively high. From compressibility charts, \( Z \) is close to 1 under these conditions, so oxygen behaves reasonably as an ideal gas.

#### b) Nitrogen at -100°C (173 K) and 10 MPa:
- Critical temperature of nitrogen: \( T_c = 126 \, \text{K} \), critical pressure: \( P_c = 3.39 \, \text{MPa} \).
- Reduced temperature: \( T_r = \frac{173}{126} \approx 1.37 \), reduced pressure: \( P_r = \frac{10}{3.39} \approx 2.95 \).
- Although the temperature is above the critical temperature, the pressure is very high (\( P_r \approx 2.95 \)), causing significant deviation from ideal gas behavior. From compressibility charts, \( Z \) is much greater than 1, so nitrogen does not behave as an ideal gas under these conditions.

#### c) Water at 40°C (313 K) and 10 kPa:
- Critical temperature of water: \( T_c = 647 \, \text{K} \), critical pressure: \( P_c = 22.06 \, \text{MPa} \).
- Reduced temperature: \( T_r = \frac{313}{647} \approx 0.48 \), reduced pressure: \( P_r = \frac{0.01}{22.06} \approx 0.00045 \).
- The pressure is very low, and the temperature is also relatively low but still above the boiling point of water at this pressure. At such low pressures, steam (water vapor) behaves ideally due to the large intermolecular distances. Thus, water vapor behaves reasonably as an ideal gas under these conditions.

### Conclusion:
- **a)** Oxygen: Reasonable.
- **b)** Nitrogen: Not reasonable.
- **c)** Water: Reasonable.

The correct answer is **A**.
