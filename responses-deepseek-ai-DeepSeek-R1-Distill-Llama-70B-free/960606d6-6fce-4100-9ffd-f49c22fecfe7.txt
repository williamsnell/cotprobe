Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two simple pendulums, A and B. Both have the same mass, which I think doesn't matter because the period of a pendulum doesn't depend on mass. The lengths of their strings are L_A and L_B respectively. They’re in the same gravitational field, so g is the same for both.

The question says that the period of pendulum B is twice that of A. I need to find the relationship between L_B and L_A from the given options.

Hmm, I remember the formula for the period of a simple pendulum is T = 2π√(L/g). Yeah, that's right. So the period depends on the square root of the length divided by g. So if the periods are different, it's because of the lengths.

Let me write down the periods for both:

T_A = 2π√(L_A / g)
T_B = 2π√(L_B / g)

The problem states that T_B is twice T_A. So,

T_B = 2 * T_A

Substituting the formulas:

2π√(L_B / g) = 2 * [2π√(L_A / g)]

Wait, let me check that. If T_B is twice T_A, then substituting:

2π√(L_B/g) = 2 * (2π√(L_A/g)) ?

Wait, no. Let me correct that. Because T_A is 2π√(L_A/g), so 2*T_A would be 2*(2π√(L_A/g)).

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because T_B is 2 times T_A, so:

T_B = 2*T_A

So,

2π√(L_B/g) = 2 * [2π√(L_A/g)] ?

Wait, no, that would make T_B four times T_A. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Let me write it correctly. T_B = 2*T_A.

So,

2π√(L_B/g) = 2 * (2π√(L_A/g)) ?

Wait, no, that's not correct because 2π√(L_A/g) is T_A. So if I multiply that by 2, that's 2*T_A, which is T_B. So,

2π√(L_B/g) = 2*(2π√(L_A/g)) ?

Wait, no, that would make T_B equal to 2 times T_A, but the equation would be:

2π√(L_B/g) = 2 * (2π√(L_A/g)) ?

Wait, that would actually make T_B equal to 4π√(L_A/g), which is 2 times T_A, because T_A is 2π√(L_A/g). So 2*T_A would be 4π√(L_A/g), which is what T_B is.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because 2π√(L_B/g) equals 2*(2π√(L_A/g)) would imply that √(L_B/g) equals 2√(L_A/g). Because 2π cancels out on both sides. So:

√(L_B/g) = 2√(L_A/g)

Then square both sides:

L_B/g = 4*(L_A/g)

Because (2√(L_A/g))^2 is 4*(L_A/g).

So then, L_B/g = 4 L_A/g.

Wait, so the g's cancel out, so L_B =4 L_A.

So then, L_B is four times L_A. Looking back at the options:

Option I is L_B=4 L_A.

So the correct answer should be I.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check my steps. Because sometimes when I'm setting up equations, I might mix up the ratios.

Let me rederive it:

Given T_B = 2 T_A.

We know T = 2π√(L/g).

So,

T_A = 2π√(L_A/g)
T_B = 2π√(L_B/g)

So,

T_B = 2 T_A
=> 2π√(L_B/g) = 2*(2π√(L_A/g))

So,

√(L_B/g) = 2 * √(L_A/g)

Squaring both sides:

(L_B/g) = 4 (L_A/g)

So,

L_B = 4 L_A.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer is I.

The problem involves two simple pendulums, A and B, with identical masses suspended from strings of lengths \( L_A \) and \( L_B \), respectively, in the same gravitational field. The period of a simple pendulum is given by the formula:

\[
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}
\]

where \( T \) is the period, \( L \) is the length of the pendulum, and \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity. Since the masses are identical and the pendulums are in the same gravitational field, the period depends only on the length \( L \).

The problem states that the period of pendulum B is twice the period of pendulum A, i.e., \( T_B = 2T_A \). Substituting the formula for the periods:

\[
2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L_B}{g}} = 2 \cdot \left(2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L_A}{g}}\right)
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{L_B}{g}} = 2 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{L_A}{g}}
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{L_B}{g} = 4 \cdot \frac{L_A}{g}
\]

Canceling \( g \) from both sides:

\[
L_B = 4L_A
\]

Thus, the length of pendulum B is four times the length of pendulum A. Among the given options, the correct one is:

I: \( L_B = 4L_A \)
