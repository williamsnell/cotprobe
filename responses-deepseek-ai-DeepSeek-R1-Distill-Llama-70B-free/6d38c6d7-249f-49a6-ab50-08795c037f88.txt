Okay, so I have this question about Piaget's stages of cognitive development, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is asking about when children develop internal representational systems that allow them to verbally describe people, events, and feelings. Hmm, I remember that Piaget proposed several stages, each with distinct characteristics.

Piaget's stages are: Sensorimotor, Preoperational, Concrete Operational, and Formal Operational. Wait, but I think there's also a mention of a Substage within Sensorimotor called the Reflexive or something, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

The Sensorimotor stage is the first one, from birth to about 2 years old. During this stage, children learn by using their senses and motor activities. They understand the world through sensory experiences and motor activities. But I don't think they develop verbal descriptions yet because language starts developing a bit later. So maybe not Sensorimotor.

Next is the Preoperational stage, roughly from 2 to 7 years old. I remember that in this stage, children start using symbols and language. They begin to engage in pretend play and use words to represent things. So this is when they develop internal representations. That makes sense because before this, in Sensorimotor, they were more about physical interactions. Preoperational is when symbolic thinking starts, like using words to describe things.

The Concrete Operational stage comes after that, around 7 to 11 years old. Here, children can perform operations and think logically about concrete events. They understand cause and effect better. But the question is about developing internal representations to describe verbally, which I think happens earlier.

Formal Operational stage is the last one, starting around 12 and onwards. This is where abstract thinking and reasoning about abstract concepts happens. But again, the question is about the initial development of internal representations for verbal descriptions, which is probably earlier.

Wait, the options include some terms I'm not as familiar with. Let me look at the options again. The options are A through J, with choices like Symbolic, Postoperational, etc. I need to match the correct stage.

Piaget's stages are Sensorimotor (D), Preoperational (H), Concrete Operational (C), and Formal Operational (I). So the question is about when internal representational systems develop for verbal descriptions. That sounds like the Preoperational stage because that's when language and symbolic thinking emerge.

So the correct answer should be H: Preoperational.

The question asks during which of Piaget's stages children develop internal representational systems that enable them to verbally describe people, events, and feelings. Piaget's stages include Sensorimotor, Preoperational, Concrete Operational, and Formal Operational. 

- **Sensorimotor (D):** This stage (0-2 years) focuses on sensory experiences and motor activities, not verbal descriptions.
- **Preoperational (H):** Occurring roughly from 2-7 years, this stage is marked by the emergence of symbolic thinking, language, and pretend play. It is here that children develop internal representations for verbal descriptions.
- **Concrete Operational (C):** This stage (7-11 years) involves logical thinking about concrete events but is not when verbal descriptive abilities first emerge.
- **Formal Operational (I):** The final stage (12+ years) involves abstract thinking, which is beyond the scope of the question.

The correct answer is the Preoperational stage (H), as it is when children begin using symbols and language to describe their experiences.
