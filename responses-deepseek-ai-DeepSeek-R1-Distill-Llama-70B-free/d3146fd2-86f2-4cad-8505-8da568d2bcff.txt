Okay, I'm trying to figure out this group theory question. Let's see what it says. So, there are two statements here.

Statement 1: Every solvable group is of prime-power order. Hmm, I remember that solvable groups have a certain property related to their derived series ending up in the trivial group. But does that mean they must have order a prime power? I'm not so sure. Wait, wait, I think that's not necessarily true. Like, for example, the symmetric group S3 is solvable. Its order is 6, which is 2*3, not a prime power. So that would mean Statement 1 is false because there's a solvable group that isn't of prime-power order.

Statement 2: Every group of prime-power order is solvable. Oh right, I think this is a theorem. Yes, I remember that all groups of order p^n (where p is prime) are solvable. The proof might involve looking at the center of the group and using induction, because the center is nontrivial for p-groups, right? So if you have a group of prime power order, it's solvable. So Statement 2 is true.

So Statement 1 is false and Statement 2 is true. Now looking at the options.

Option I says: False, True. That would be the case here. Let me check the options again.

The options are A through J. Looking through them:

Option I: Statement 1 is always false, Statement 2 is always true. Wait, the question is whether each is true or false, not their generality. Oh wait, actually, the options describe whether each statement is always true, sometimes true, etc.

Wait, the options:

Option I: False, True. So Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true.

Yes, that's what I concluded. So the correct choice would be I.

Statement 1 claims that every solvable group is of prime-power order. This is false because there exist solvable groups with orders that are not prime powers. For example, the symmetric group \( S_3 \) is solvable and has order 6, which is not a prime power.

Statement 2 asserts that every group of prime-power order is solvable. This is true, as it is a well-known theorem in group theory that all \( p \)-groups (groups of order \( p^n \) for some prime \( p \)) are solvable. The proof involves using the fact that the center of a \( p \)-group is nontrivial and applying induction.

Given this analysis, Statement 1 is false, and Statement 2 is true. The correct option is:

I: Statement 1 is always false, Statement 2 is always true.
