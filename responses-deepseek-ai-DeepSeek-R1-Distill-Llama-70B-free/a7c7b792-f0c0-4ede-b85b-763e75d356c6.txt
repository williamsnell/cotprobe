Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve this problem about Bob's bankruptcy. Let me think through it step by step.

So, Bob has debts totaling $25,000, but he only has $15,000 to pay his creditors. I guess this means he can't pay all his debts in full, so he's probably going to pay a portion of each debt. The question is asking two things: how many cents on the dollar each creditor gets, and how much a specific creditor with a $4,500 claim would receive.

First, I need to find out the percentage or fraction that each creditor will get. Since the total debt is $25k and he's paying $15k, I think it's a proportion of what he owes. So, the fraction would be the amount he can pay divided by the total debt. Let me write that out.

Fraction = Total available / Total debt = 15,000 / 25,000.

Calculating that, 15 divided by 25 is 0.6. So 0.6 is the same as 60%, which is 60 cents on the dollar. That makes sense because if you can't pay the full dollar, you pay 60 cents for each dollar owed.

Now, the next part is finding out how much the creditor with a $4,500 claim gets. So, if they're getting 60% of their claim, I need to calculate 60% of $4,500.

Let me compute that. 60% is 0.6, so 0.6 multiplied by 4,500. 0.6 * 4,500 = 2,700. So that creditor would get $2,700.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that matches 60 cents on the dollar and $2,700. Let me scan through the options.

Option H says 60 cents on the dollar and $2,700. So that matches my calculations. Let me double-check the other options to make sure I didn't miss anything. 

Option A is 65 cents and $2,925. That's more than 60, which doesn't fit because 15k is less than the total debt. Option B is 66, which would imply a higher payment. Option C is 80, which is way higher. Option D is 75, also higher. Option E is 40, which is lower than 60. Option F is 55, still lower. Option G is 70, higher. Option I is 50, lower. Option J is 30, way lower. So none of the others fit except H.

Wait, but I should make sure I'm not making a mistake with the division. 15,000 divided by 25,000 is indeed 0.6, which is 60%. And 60% of 4,500 is 2,700. Yeah, that's correct.

To determine how many cents on the dollar Bob pays each creditor and how much a creditor with a $4,500 claim receives, we first calculate the fraction of the debt that can be paid. Bob has $15,000 available to pay $25,000 in debts, so the fraction is:

\[
\text{Fraction} = \frac{\$15,000}{\$25,000} = 0.6 \, \text{(or 60 cents on the dollar)}.
\]

Next, we calculate the payment for a creditor with a $4,500 claim by taking 60% of $4,500:

\[
\text{Payment} = 0.6 \times \$4,500 = \$2,700.
\]

Thus, Bob pays 60 cents on the dollar, and the creditor with a $4,500 claim receives $2,700. Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:

**H: 60 cents on the dollar, $2,700.**

Answer: H
