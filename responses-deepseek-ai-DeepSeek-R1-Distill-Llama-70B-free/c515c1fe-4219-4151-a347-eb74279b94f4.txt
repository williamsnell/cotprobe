Okay, I have this question about a sentence: "Mommy gived me a cookie." I need to figure out what this illustrates in terms of language development. Let me think through each option.

So the sentence uses "gived" which isn't correct. I remember that in language acquisition, children often make mistakes with irregular verbs. Instead of using the correct past tense like "gave," the child uses "give" and adds "-d" to make "gived." That seems like they're applying a rule they've learned, maybe the rule for regular past tense verbs, which is adding "-ed." So they're overapplying that rule to an irregular verb, which doesn't follow that pattern.

Looking at the options: A is prelinguistic speech, which is before they start using words, so probably not. B is overgeneralization, which sounds exactly like what I was thinking. C is syntax, which is about sentence structure. The sentence structure here seems correct, so maybe not. D is semantics, about meaning, which doesn't seem to fit. E is grammar, which is broader. The mistake is a specific grammatical error, so maybe E could be an option, but B is more precise because it's about applying a rule too widely. F is holophrases, which are single-word sentences, not applicable here. G is phonology, which deals with sound, but the issue is with the verb form, not pronunciation. H is pragmatics, how language is used in context, which doesn't fit. I is phonemes, individual sounds, again not relevant. J is morphemes, which are units of meaning. The "-ed" is a morpheme, but the issue is how it's being used incorrectly, so overgeneralization is more about the process than the morpheme itself.

So putting it all together, the child is overgeneralizing the past tense rule by adding "-d" to an irregular verb. Therefore, the correct answer should be B: overgeneralization.

The sentence "Mommy gived me a cookie" demonstrates a child applying the regular past tense rule ("+ed") to an irregular verb ("give" â†’ "gave"), resulting in the incorrect form "gived." This is an example of overgeneralization, where a linguistic rule is applied beyond its correct usage. 

Answer: B
