Question:

Solve the following problems. (a) A plot of land containing 487 (1/2) acres were broken up into smaller plots containing 3 (1/4) acres apiece. Find the number of smaller plots that were formed.

Find how many graduating seniors will have an A average. (c) TheGoreman'sGlue Factory wishes to package 4,000 pints of glue in containerthat hold (2/3) pint each. How may containers are needed?

A: 145 plots, 45 graduating seniors with an A average, 6100 containers
B: 160 plots, 40 graduating seniors with an A average, 7000 containers
C: 135 plots, 65 graduating seniors with an A average, 5900 containers

Okay, so I've got this math problem with three parts, and I need to figure out each one step by step. Let's start with part (a).

(a) The problem says there's a plot of land with 487 and a half acres. So that's 487.5 acres in total. They broke this land into smaller plots, each being 3 and a quarter acres. I need to find out how many of these smaller plots were formed. 

Hmm, I think I should convert those mixed numbers to improper fractions or decimals to make division easier. 3 1/4 acres is the same as 3.25 acres. So, the total acres are 487.5, and each small plot is 3.25 acres. So the number of plots should be 487.5 divided by 3.25.

Let me do that calculation. 487.5 รท 3.25. Let me see, 3.25 times 150 is 487.5 because 3.25 times 100 is 325, times 50 is 162.5, so 100+50=150 gives 325+162.5=487.5. Oh, wait, so 150 plots? But wait, looking at the options, let me check the choices again. Option H says 150 plots, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, another way: 3.25 is 13/4. So 487.5 divided by 13/4 is the same as 487.5 multiplied by 4/13. Let's compute that. 487.5 *4 = 1950. Then 1950 divided by 13. Hmm, 13 times 150 is 1950. So yes, that's 150. So part (a) is 150 plots.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H says 150 for part (a), which is one of the choices. So that's probably correct.

Now moving on to part (b). There are 450 freshmen, and only 2/3 of them will graduate. So first, I need to find how many graduate. 2/3 of 450. Let me compute that: 450 * (2/3) = 300. So 300 students graduate.

Of those 300 graduates, 1/6 will have an A average. So 300 multiplied by 1/6 is 50. So 50 graduating seniors have an A average. So part (b) is 50.

Looking at the options, let's see which option has 50 for part (b). Option H has 50, and option B has 40, option D has 60, etc. So H seems to fit for part (b) as well.

Now part (c): The Goreman's Glue Factory wants to package 4,000 pints into containers that hold 2/3 pint each. So I need to find how many containers are needed.

Wait, containers hold 2/3 of a pint each. So for 4000 pints, how many 2/3 pints containers do we need? It's 4000 divided by (2/3), which is the same as 4000 multiplied by 3/2.

So 4000 * 3 = 12,000. Then 12,000 divided by 2 is 6,000. So they need 6,000 containers.

Looking at the options, option H has 6000 containers. So all three parts point to option H.

The solution involves addressing each part of the problem systematically:

**(a)** A plot of land containing 487.5 acres is divided into smaller plots of 3.25 acres each. To find the number of smaller plots:

\[
\text{Number of plots} = \frac{487.5}{3.25} = 150
\]

Thus, **150 smaller plots** are formed.

**(b)** Out of 450 freshmen, only \(\frac{2}{3}\) will graduate. The number of graduates is:

\[
\text{Graduates} = 450 \times \frac{2}{3} = 300
\]

Of these 300 graduates, \(\frac{1}{6}\) will have an A average:

\[
\text{A average graduates} = 300 \times \frac{1}{6} = 50
\]

Thus, **50 graduating seniors** will have an A average.

**(c)** The Goreman's Glue Factory needs to package 4,000 pints of glue into containers that hold \(\frac{2}{3}\) pint each. The number of containers required is:

\[
\text{Containers} = \frac{4000}{\frac{2}{3}} = 4000 \times \frac{3}{2} = 6000
\]

Thus, **6,000 containers** are needed.

From the options provided, **H** matches all three results: 150 plots, 50 graduating seniors with an A average, and 6,000 containers.

**Answer: H**
