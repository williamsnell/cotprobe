Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the remainder when 3^47 is divided by 23. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky at first, but I remember something about Fermat's theorem that might help here. Let me think through this step by step.

Wait, Fermat's Little Theorem, right? I think that's the one where if you have a prime number p and a number a that's not divisible by p, then a^(p-1) is congruent to 1 modulo p. Oh, right, because 23 is a prime number, so that should work here. So in this case, a is 3 and p is 23. 

So according to Fermat's theorem, 3^(22) â‰¡ 1 mod 23. That means every 22 exponents, it cycles back to 1. So 3^22 is 1 mod 23, 3^44 would be (3^22)^2, which is 1 squared, so 1 again mod23. 

But wait, the exponent we're dealing with is 47, which is higher than 44. So how do I break this down? Let me subtract 44 from 47. That leaves 3. So 3^47 is the same as 3^(44+3), which is 3^44 * 3^3. 

Since 3^44 mod23 is 1, that simplifies to 1 * 3^3. So now I just need to compute 3^3 and find what that is mod23. 

3^3 is 27. Now, 27 divided by 23 is 1 with a remainder of 4. So 27 mod23 is 4. That means 3^47 mod23 is 4. 

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 4. So the answer should be D. 

But wait, did I do everything right? Let me double-check. Let's see: 3^1 is 3 mod23, 3^2 is 9, 3^3 is 27 which is 4 mod23. Then 3^4 would be 3^3 *3, which is 4*3=12 mod23. 3^5 is 12*3=36 mod23 is 13, because 36-23=13. Then 3^6 is 13*3=39 mod23 is 16, since 39-23=16. 3^7 is 16*3=48 mod23 is 48-46=2, because 23*2=46. Hmm, but wait, maybe I should just stick with Fermat's approach since calculating each power up to 47 would take too long.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the exponent breakdown. Let me confirm. 47 divided by 22 is 2 with a remainder of 3, because 22*2=44, 47-44=3. So yes, 3^47 = (3^22)^2 * 3^3. Which is 1^2 * 27 =27 mod23=4. So yes, that's correct. 

So the remainder is 4, which is option D.

To find the remainder of \(3^{47}\) when divided by 23, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem. Fermat's theorem states that for a prime \(p\) and an integer \(a\) not divisible by \(p\), \(a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \mod p\). Here, \(p = 23\) and \(a = 3\), so \(3^{22} \equiv 1 \mod 23\).

To simplify \(3^{47}\), we express the exponent as \(47 = 22 \cdot 2 + 3\). This allows us to rewrite \(3^{47}\) as:

\[
3^{47} = (3^{22})^2 \cdot 3^3
\]

Using Fermat's theorem, \(3^{22} \equiv 1 \mod 23\), so:

\[
(3^{22})^2 \equiv 1^2 \equiv 1 \mod 23
\]

Thus, \(3^{47} \equiv 1 \cdot 3^3 \mod 23\). Now, calculate \(3^3\):

\[
3^3 = 27
\]

Finally, find \(27 \mod 23\):

\[
27 \div 23 = 1 \text{ with a remainder of } 4, \text{ so } 27 \equiv 4 \mod 23
\]

Therefore, the remainder of \(3^{47}\) when divided by 23 is **4**.

The correct answer is:

**D: 4**
