Question:

A plaintiff sued a department store for injuries she sustained when she slipped and fell in the store. At trial, the plaintiff proposes to testify that, when the store manager rushed to the scene, he said to the plaintiff, "I'm so sorry about the water on the floor there, but don't worry the store will pay for the ambulance and your hospital bill." The store's attorney objects. How should the court rule on the admissibility of the store manager's testimony?

Options:

A: The testimony is inadmissible, because it is considered a hearsay exception for statements of personal or family history.
B: The testimony about the water is an admissible statement of an opposing party, but the rest of the testimony is inadmissible as an offer to pay medical expenses.
C: The testimony is inadmissible in its entirety, because it is hearsay not within any exception.
D: The testimony is admissible in its entirety as the statement of an opposing party.
E: The testimony is admissible in its entirety, because it is considered a party admission.
F: The testimony is inadmissible in its entirety, because the manager's statement is in the context of an offer to pay medical expenses.
G: The testimony is admissible in its entirety as a res gestae statement.
H: The testimony is inadmissible because it violates the rule against hearsay, with no applicable exceptions.
I: The testimony about the water is inadmissible, but the statement about paying for the ambulance and hospital bill is admissible as an admission of guilt.
J: The testimony is inadmissible in its entirety, because it is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted.

Okay, so I've got this evidence question here about hearsay and exceptions. Let me think through it step by step. The question is about a plaintiff suing a department store after slipping and falling. At trial, she wants to testify about what the store manager said when he came to the scene. The manager said, "I'm so sorry about the water on the floor there, but don't worry— the store will pay for the ambulance and your hospital bill." The store's attorney objects, and we need to figure out if the court should allow this testimony.

Hmm, I remember that hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted. So the manager's statement is being offered to prove that the store was at fault, perhaps, or that they accepted responsibility.

Wait, but there's an exception for admissions by a party-opponent. Right, under FRE 801(d)(2), a statement is not hearsay if it's offered against an opposing party and was made by the party's agent or employee on a matter within the scope of their agency or employment, and made during the employment relationship.

So in this case, the manager is an employee of the store, and the statement was made during his employment. The first part about the water on the floor sounds like an admission of a fact—implying that the store was responsible for the water being there. The second part is about paying medical bills, which is an offer to pay, but I think offers to pay medical expenses are admissible under another rule.

Wait, there's a specific rule about offers to pay medical expenses. FRE 409 says that evidence of offering or paying medical expenses is not admissible to prove liability, but it can be admitted for other purposes, like proving the extent of the injury. But wait, in this case, the manager's statement includes both an admission of the water (which caused the fall) and an offer to pay.

So the first part, about the water, is an admission by a party opponent and thus not hearsay. The second part, about paying the bills, though, is an offer to pay, which might be covered under another rule. Oh, right, under FRE 409, evidence of such offers is inadmissible only when offered to prove liability for the injury. But if it's being offered for another purpose, like showing that the store accepted responsibility, then it might be admissible.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. If the statement is being offered to show the store's liability, then the part about paying the bills would be inadmissible under 409. Because 409 excludes such evidence when it's used to prove liability. But the part about the water would still be admissible as a party admission.

So the testimony includes two parts: the admission about the water and the offer to pay. The first part is okay, the second part may not be. But wait, no, let's look at the options. The question is about the admissibility of the manager's entire statement as proposed by the plaintiff.

Option D says it's admissible in its entirety as a statement of an opposing party. But that can't be right because part of it (the offer to pay) might be excluded under 409. Alternatively, maybe the entire statement is admissible because it's a party admission, but 409 might still block part of it.

Alternatively, maybe the offer to pay is not excluded because it's part of the same statement as the admission. Or perhaps the offer to pay is also admissible as a party admission, because it's an acknowledgment of responsibility.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify: Under FRE 801(d)(2), any statement made by a party's agent or employee concerning a matter within their authority and during employment is an admission and not hearsay. So the manager's entire statement, including the offer to pay, would qualify as a party admission. But then FRE 409 comes into play, which says that evidence of offers to pay medical expenses is inadmissible when offered to prove liability. But if the purpose is to show the store's liability (i.e., that they accepted responsibility), then the offer to pay might be excluded under 409.

Wait, but the statement is being offered both to show that the store was at fault (water on the floor) and to accept responsibility (offering to pay). So the first part is an admission, admissible. The second part is an offer to pay, which under 409 is inadmissible if offered to prove liability. However, the manager's statement is a single statement, so maybe it's being offered for a non-hearsay purpose, like to show the manager's state of mind, but that seems unlikely here.

Alternatively, perhaps the offer to pay is also part of the admission. Because the manager is not just offering to pay, but also stating that the store will pay, which could be an admission that they are responsible. So maybe the entire statement is admissible as a party admission, and 409 doesn't apply because the offer isn't being used just to show that they offered to pay, but as part of the admission.

Wait, but I think the offer to pay medical expenses is specifically addressed in 409, which says that such evidence is inadmissible to prove liability. So even if it's part of a larger admission, the part about paying the bills might be excluded under 409.

Wait, but the rule against hearsay is that the statement is being offered for the truth of the matter. So the manager's statement about the water is for the truth (that water was on the floor), and the offer to pay is for the truth (that the store accepted responsibility). So the first part is admissible as a party admission, the second part may be inadmissible under 409 if it's being used to establish liability.

But wait, no, 409 says that evidence of offering or promising to pay medical expenses is not admissible to prove liability. So if the plaintiff is offering the statement to prove that the store was liable (i.e., because they accepted responsibility), then the offer to pay part would be inadmissible under 409. But the part about the water would still be admissible as an admission.

So looking back at the options: Option B says the testimony about the water is admissible as an opposing party statement, but the rest is inadmissible as an offer to pay. That would make sense because the first part is a party admission, the second part is excluded under 409.

Option D says it's admissible in its entirety as a statement of an opposing party. But that would ignore 409. So I think the correct answer would be that part of it is admissible and part is not. But looking at the options, option B is: testimony about the water is admissible, rest inadmissible. Option E says it's all admissible as a party admission. Option H says it's all inadmissible as hearsay with no exception, which can't be right because part is an admission.

So I think the correct answer is B. Wait, but let me check again. The manager's statement includes two parts: the water (admission) and the offer to pay (which under 409 is inadmissible if offered to prove liability). So the court would allow the part about the water but exclude the part about paying the bills. So the testimony as a whole would have part admitted and part excluded. But the question is about the admissibility of the manager's testimony as proposed. So the plaintiff is testifying about the entire statement. The court would need to determine which parts are admissible.

Wait, but the options don't include partial admissibility except for option B and I. Option I says the water part is inadmissible, which doesn't make sense because that's clearly a party admission. So option B is the only one that splits it correctly.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a store manager's statement to a plaintiff, which includes both an admission about water on the floor and an offer to pay medical expenses. The manager's statement is being offered by the plaintiff, and the store's attorney has objected. The analysis focuses on hearsay and its exceptions, particularly under Federal Rule of Evidence (FRE) 801(d)(2) and FRE 409.

1. **Hearsay and Party Admissions**: Under FRE 801(d)(2), a statement made by an opposing party's agent or employee, concerning a matter within the scope of their agency or employment, is not hearsay. Here, the manager's statement about the water on the floor qualifies as a party admission, as it is an acknowledgment of a fact (water on the floor) that could establish the store's responsibility.

2. **Offer to Pay Medical Expenses**: The second part of the manager's statement, regarding payment for the ambulance and hospital bill, falls under FRE 409. This rule prohibits the use of offers or promises to pay medical expenses to prove liability. If the plaintiff is offering this part of the statement to establish the store's liability, it would be inadmissible under FRE 409.

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The statement is not admissible under the hearsay exception for statements of personal or family history.
   - **Option B**: Correct. The testimony about the water is admissible as a party admission, but the offer to pay medical expenses is inadmissible under FRE 409 if used to prove liability.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The statement about the water is admissible as a party admission, so the testimony is not entirely inadmissible.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. While the statement about the water is admissible as a party admission, the offer to pay medical expenses is inadmissible under FRE 409.
   - **Option E**: Incorrect. The entire statement is not admissible because the offer to pay medical expenses is excluded under FRE 409.
   - **Option F**: Incorrect. The statement about the water is admissible as a party admission.
   - **Option G**: Incorrect. The statement does not qualify as a res gestae statement.
   - **Option H**: Incorrect. The statement about the water is admissible as a party admission.
   - **Option I**: Incorrect. The testimony about the water is admissible, so this option is inconsistent with the facts.
   - **Option J**: Incorrect. The statement about the water is admissible as a party admission.

**Conclusion**: The testimony about the water is admissible as a party admission, but the offer to pay medical expenses is inadmissible under FRE 409 if used to prove liability. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B**
