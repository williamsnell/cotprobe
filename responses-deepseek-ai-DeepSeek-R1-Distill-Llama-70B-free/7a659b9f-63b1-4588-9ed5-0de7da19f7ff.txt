Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about equity and bonds. I'm a bit rusty on my finance terms, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which statement is true of equity but not of bonds. The options are A through I. Let me go through each option one by one.

First, I need to remember what equity and bonds are. Equity refers to shares in a company, like stocks. When you buy equity, you're essentially buying a part of the company. Bonds, on the other hand, are debt instruments. When you buy a bond, you're lending money to the company or government, and they pay you back with interest.

Option A: They can be issued by firms. Wait, both equity and bonds are issued by firms, right? Companies issue stocks (equity) to raise capital, and they also issue bonds as debt. So A is true for both, so it's not the answer.

Option B: They can be traded on the secondary market. Hmm, yes. Stocks are definitely traded on secondary markets like stock exchanges. Bonds can also be traded on secondary markets. So B is true for both, so not the answer.

Option C: They have a fixed interest rate. Bonds typically have fixed interest rates, known as coupons. Equity doesn't have a fixed rate because dividends can vary and aren't guaranteed. So C is true for bonds, not equity. So since the question is about what's true for equity but not bonds, C is not the answer.

Option D: They cannot be traded on the secondary market. I don't think this is true for either. Both can be traded, so D is false for both. Not the answer.

Option E: Their payouts are exempt from corporation tax. Wait, corporation tax is what companies pay on their profits. For bonds, the interest paid is an expense for the company, so it's tax-deductible. But for equity, when a company pays dividends, those are paid from after-tax profits, so they don't get a tax deduction. But do the payouts themselves (dividends) get taxed again? I think for the recipients, dividends are taxed as income, but the company doesn't pay tax on them. Wait, but the question is about whether the payouts are exempt from corporation tax. So for bonds, the interest is tax-deductible, meaning the company pays less tax because of it. For equity, the dividends are paid after the company has already paid tax. So the dividend payments themselves aren't taxed again, but the company doesn't get a deduction for them. So E says their payouts are exempt from corporation tax. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Maybe E is true for equity because the company doesn't pay tax on dividends, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think more about this.

Option F: They are considered a form of debt. No, equity is ownership, not debt. Bonds are debt. So F is true for bonds, not equity. So F isn't the answer.

Option G: Their payouts (dividend or coupons) are made after corporation tax has already been deducted. So for bonds, the interest is paid before tax (since it's an expense), so the company can deduct it, meaning the payout is made after considering the tax. Wait, no, the company pays interest from pre-tax income, so the interest is an expense that reduces taxable income. So the actual payment of interest happens before taxes in the sense that it's an expense. For equity, dividends are paid from after-tax profits. So G says payouts are made after corporation tax. So for bonds, the payout (interest) is paid from pre-tax income, so G would be false for bonds because tax hasn't been deducted yet when they pay interest. For equity, dividends are paid after tax, so G is true for equity. So G could be the answer. But wait, let me check the other options.

Option H: They are issued by government entities. Both equity and bonds can be issued by governments? Wait, no. Equity is issued by companies. Governments don't issue equity; they issue bonds. So H is false for equity and true for bonds. So H isn't the answer.

Option I: Their payouts are made before corporation tax has been deducted. So for bonds, interest is paid before tax because it's an expense. For equity, dividends are after tax. So I is true for bonds but not for equity. So since the question is about equity, I is false for equity. So I isn't the answer.

So going back, the question is which is true of equity but not bonds. Let's recap:

Looking at option G: Payouts are made after corp tax. That applies to equity because dividends are after tax, but not to bonds because interest is before tax. So G is true for equity but not bonds.

Option E: Their payouts are exempt from corporation tax. Wait, for equity, the company's dividend payments are not tax-deductible. So when a company pays dividends, it doesn't reduce its taxable income. But for bonds, the interest paid is tax-deductible. So the payout (dividend) for equity is made after the company has paid tax, so the company doesn't get a tax exemption on the payout. But the payout itself (the dividend) isn't taxed again to the company. So E says their payouts are exempt from corporation tax. Does that mean the company doesn't pay tax on the payout? Well, the company already paid tax on the profits before distributing dividends. So the dividend isn't taxed again when paid out. So E would be true for equity. So E could be correct.

Wait, but I thought G was about the timing relative to tax deduction. So for equity, payout is after tax, so G is true for equity, and not for bonds because bonds' payouts are before tax.

So now I'm a bit confused between E and G.

Let me clarify:

For bonds: The company pays interest, which is a tax-deductible expense. So the company's taxable income is reduced by the interest paid, so the interest is paid from pre-tax income.

For equity: The company pays dividends from after-tax income, so the dividends are paid after the company has already paid corporation tax on its profits.

So, looking at option G: Their payouts are made after corporation tax has already been deducted. This is true for equity. For bonds, payouts (interest) are made before tax, so G is false for bonds. So G is true for equity, not for bonds. So G is a correct statement.

Option E says their payouts are exempt from corporation tax. So for equity, the payouts (dividends) are made after tax, but the company doesn't get a tax deduction for them. So the payouts themselves are not taxed again, but the company doesn't get to deduct them. So are the payouts exempt from corporation tax? I think yes. Because the company doesn't pay tax on the dividend payments again; they're after tax. So E would be true for equity. But wait, does that mean E is correct?

Wait, the question is which is true for equity but not for bonds.

Option E: Their payouts are exempt from corporation tax.

For equity: The dividend payments are made after the company has paid corporation tax, so the company doesn't pay tax on the dividend. So their payouts (dividends) are exempt from corporation tax.

For bonds: The interest is tax-deductible, meaning the company can subtract the interest from taxable income, thus reducing the corporation tax. So the interest isn't exempt; it's a deduction. So for bonds, the payouts (interest) are not exempt from corporation tax; instead, they're deductible, so the company pays less tax because of them.

So E would be true for equity but not for bonds. So E is a correct statement.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting possibilities between E and G. Let me make sure.

Option G says payouts are made after corporation tax has been deducted. So for equity, yes, because dividends are paid from after-tax profits. For bonds, the interest is paid before tax, so G is not true for bonds.

Option E says payouts are exempt from corporation tax. That's also true for equity because the company doesn't pay tax on the dividends; they're paid after tax. So both G and E seem correct for equity, but the question is which is true for equity but not bonds.

Wait, looking again at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Looking at the options, E and G:

E: Their payouts are exempt from corporation tax.

G: Their payouts are made after corporation tax has already been deducted.

Wait, for bonds: The interest is tax-deductible. So the company's taxable income is reduced by the interest, so the interest isn't taxed. So are the payouts (interest) of bonds exempt from corporation tax? Or is it that the company can deduct the interest, so the interest is not part of taxable income.

In that case, the interest is an expense, so the company pays less tax because of it, but the interest itself isn't taxed. So the interest payout is not subject to corporation tax; it's an expense that reduces taxable income. So for bonds, E would be true because their payouts (interest) are exempt from corporation tax.

Wait, but that can't be right because E would then be true for both equity and bonds, making it not the correct answer.

Wait, no: For bonds, the interest is an expense, so the company can deduct it, meaning the interest is not taxed at the corporate level; it's an expense. So the payout (interest) is made from pre-tax income, so the company doesn't pay tax on the interest. So E would be true for bonds as well, meaning E can't be the correct answer because the question asks for something true of equity but not bonds.

So if E is true for both, then E isn't the answer. So that leaves G as the correct option.

Because G is true for equity but not for bonds.

So to recap:

Equity: Dividends are paid after corporation tax, so G is true.

Bonds: Interest is paid before tax, so G is false.

Therefore, the correct answer is G.

To determine which statement is true of equity but not of bonds, let's analyze each option:

- **A**: Both equity and bonds can be issued by firms, so this is not unique to equity.  
- **B**: Both equity and bonds can be traded on the secondary market, so this is not unique to equity.  
- **C**: Bonds typically have fixed interest rates, while equity does not, so this is true for bonds but not equity.  
- **D**: Both equity and bonds can be traded on the secondary market, so this is false for both.  
- **E**: Equity payouts (dividends) are made after corporation tax, so they are exempt from corporation tax. Bonds, however, have tax-deductible interest, meaning their payouts reduce taxable income but are not exempt. This makes E true for equity but not for bonds.  
- **F**: Bonds are a form of debt, while equity is not, so this is false for equity.  
- **G**: Equity payouts (dividends) are made after corporation tax has been deducted, while bond payouts (interest) are made before tax. This makes G true for equity but not for bonds.  
- **H**: Bonds can be issued by government entities, but equity is typically issued by companies, so this is false for equity.  
- **I**: Bond payouts (interest) are made before corporation tax, while equity payouts (dividends) are made after tax, so this is false for equity.  

Both **E** and **G** are true for equity but not for bonds. However, **G** is the more precise answer because it directly addresses the timing of payouts relative to corporation tax, which is the key distinction between equity and bonds.

**Answer: G**
