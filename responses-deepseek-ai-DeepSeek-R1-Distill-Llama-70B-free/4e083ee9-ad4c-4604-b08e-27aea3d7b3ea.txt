Okay, so I've got this question about psychoanalytic theory and anxiety. Hmm, I remember that psychoanalysis is all about the unconscious mind and internal conflicts. So the question is asking what causes anxiety according to this theory.

The options are A, B, and C. Let me think about each one.

Option A says anxiety arises from incongruence between a stranger and the memory of the mother. Wait, that sounds familiar, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's related to attachment theory or something else. I think that might be more about stranger anxiety in children, like when a child gets scared of someone new because they don't match the familiar face of the mother. But is that specifically from psychoanalytic theory? I'm not certain.

Option B states it's a failure of defenses to modulate excitation adequately. Oh right, in psychoanalysis, the ego uses defense mechanisms to handle stress and anxiety. If these defenses aren't working well, the person can't cope, leading to anxiety. So when the defenses fail, the individual can't manage their emotions properly, causing anxiety to surface. That makes sense. I think Freud talked about how the ego deals with the id and reality, and when it can't, anxiety happens.

Option C mentions a failure to dissolve a symbiotic attachment. Symbiotic relationships are like overly dependent ones, maybe between a child and parent. If you can't break that, does it cause anxiety? I'm not too sure. I think separation anxiety might come from that, but I'm not certain if that's the primary cause according to psychoanalytic theory.

Wait, I should probably recall what I learned about the sources of anxiety in psychoanalysis. Freud's earliest theories talked about anxiety being a result of repressed sexual desires, but later he said it's a signal of the ego that something is wrong. So when the ego can't cope with the demands of the id, superego, or reality, it gets anxious.

So the failure of defense mechanisms (which are part of the ego's functions) would lead to anxiety because the ego can't modulate the excitation or stressors. That points me to option B.

Option A seems more like a developmental milestone issue, maybe from a different theory. Option C sounds like it's related to attachment issues, which might tie into object relations theory more than classic psychoanalysis.

So I think the correct answer is B.

The question asks about the cause of anxiety according to psychoanalytic theory. 

- **Option A** suggests anxiety arises from incongruence between a stranger and the memory of the mother. This seems more related to stranger anxiety in children and may not align directly with psychoanalytic theory.  
- **Option B** states anxiety results from a failure of defenses to modulate excitation adequately. This aligns with psychoanalytic concepts, as Freud discussed how the ego uses defense mechanisms to manage stress, and their failure can lead to anxiety.  
- **Option C** refers to a failure to dissolve a symbiotic attachment, which may relate to attachment issues or separation anxiety but doesn't directly tie to the core psychoanalytic explanation of anxiety.

Given Freud's emphasis on the ego's role in managing internal and external demands, the failure of defense mechanisms (Option B) is the most accurate answer.

Answer: B
