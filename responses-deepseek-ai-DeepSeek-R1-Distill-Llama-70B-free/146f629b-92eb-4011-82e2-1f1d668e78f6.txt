Question:

A woman owned a four-unit apartment building and lived in one of the units. When one of her tenants vacated his apartment, the woman placed an advertisement in the local paper that read as follows: "Large two-bedroom apartment available for rent. White male preferred." The woman's preference was motivated by the fact that she liked to have a mix of tenants of both genders and from various racial and ethnic backgrounds in her building, and of the remaining rented units, one was rented to an African American man and the other to a Pacific Islander woman. Based upon these facts, which of the following statements is true?

Options:

A: The federal Fair Housing Act doesn't apply to private landlords.
B: Under the federal Fair Housing Act, the woman was not permitted to state a racial or gender preference in the advertisement.
C: The woman's actions are only a violation of state laws, not federal laws.
D: The woman's preference is considered discriminatory only if she refuses to rent to a qualified tenant based on their race or gender.
E: The woman's racial or gender preference is allowed under the federal Fair Housing Act if it promotes diversity.
F: The federal Fair Housing Act makes it illegal for the woman to refuse to rent her units to prospective tenants because of their race or gender.
G: The woman's motive absolves her from any liability under the federal Fair Housing Act.
H: There are no violations of any federal laws under these facts.
I: The woman's actions are legal under the federal Fair Housing Act as long as she doesn't act on her preference.
J: The woman's actions are legal as long as the apartment is in her primary residence.

Okay, so I have this question about the Fair Housing Act, and I'm a bit rusty on housing law, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

A woman owns a four-unit apartment building and lives in one unit. One tenant moved out, so she advertised the apartment. The ad says, "Large two-bedroom apartment available for rent. White male preferred." Her reason was that she wanted a mix of genders and racial backgrounds. The other rented units are occupied by an African American man and a Pacific Islander woman.

The question is about whether her actions are legal under the Fair Housing Act, and which statement is true based on the options given.

First, I remember that the Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, and familial status. So, if she's stating a preference for a white male, that could be problematic.

Wait, but she's a private landlord. Does the Fair Housing Act apply to her? I think it applies to most housing providers, except for certain exempt situations. Like, if the building has fewer than four units and the owner lives there, maybe? But wait, this building has four units, and she lives in one. So the exemption might not apply. Because I recall that the exemption for owner-occupied buildings with four or fewer units doesn't apply if it's a multi-unit building where the owner lives in one. Or wait, the exemption is for buildings with four or fewer units and the owner lives there. So in this case, she owns a four-unit building and lives in one, so maybe the Act still applies? Or does the exemption apply?

Wait, no. The Fair Housing Act exempts owner-occupied buildings with four or fewer units. So if the building has four units and the owner lives in one, it's still covered by the Act because the exemption is for owner-occupied buildings with four or fewer units, but only if it's a two-family dwelling. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing this up. Let me think again.

Wait, the exemption applies to owner-occupied buildings with four or fewer units. So if she owns a four-unit building and lives in one, then the exemption would apply. Wait, no, because the exemption is for buildings with four or fewer units, but if it's more than that, it's covered. Wait, no, the Fair Housing Act applies to most housing, including rentals of single-family homes if managed or owned by a company, but for private individuals, the exemption applies to owner-occupied buildings with four or fewer units.

So in this case, the building has four units, and she lives in one, so it's a four-unit building where the owner occupies one. So the exemption would apply. Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to recall. The Fair Housing Act's exemption for "the rental of a single-family house or a unit in a duplex, or a room or suite in a dwelling, if the owner actually maintains and occupies the property as his or her residence." So in this case, she owns a four-unit building and lives in one unit. So it's a four-plex, not a duplex. So the exemption would not apply because it's more than a duplex. Therefore, the Fair Housing Act would apply to her.

So if she's advertising a racial preference, that's a violation. The ad says "white male preferred," which is clearly stating a racial and gender preference. Under the Act, it's illegal to make, print, or publish any notice or statement indicating a preference based on protected characteristics.

So looking at the options:

Option B: Under the federal Fair Housing Act, the woman was not permitted to state a racial or gender preference in the advertisement. That seems correct, because the Act prohibits such statements.

Option F: The federal Fair Housing Act makes it illegal for the woman to refuse to rent her units to prospective tenants because of their race or gender. That's also true, but the question is about the advertisement, which is prohibited regardless of whether she actually refuses to rent.

So, the act of advertising a preference is itself a violation, even if she doesn't act on it. So her actions in placing the ad are illegal.

Looking at the options again:

Option B says she was not permitted to state the preference in the advertisement. So this would be correct.

Option F is about refusal to rent, which is also illegal, but the ad itself is a separate violation.

So the correct statement is B.

Wait, but wait another thing. The woman's motivation was to have a mix of tenants. She thought she was promoting diversity. Does that make any difference? I don't think so, because the Act doesn't allow you to discriminate even with good intentions. So her motive doesn't absolve her of liability.

Looking at the other options:

Option E says her preference is allowed if promoting diversity. That's incorrect.

Option D says it's only a violation if she refuses to rent based on race or gender. But the ad itself is a violation, so D is incorrect.

Option G says her motive absolves her. No, motives don't matter; it's the action that counts.

Option A says the Act doesn't apply to private landlords. But as we discussed, in this case, the Act does apply because it's a four-unit building, and the exemption only applies to up to four units if it's owner-occupied. Wait, no, the exemption applies to owner-occupied buildings with four or fewer units. Wait, if the building has four units and she lives in one, does the exemption apply? Let me think. The exemption is for buildings with four or fewer units where the owner lives in one of them. So in this case, the building has four units, and she lives in one. So the exemption applies, and the Fair Housing Act would not apply. Wait, no, I'm getting this wrong. The exact wording of the exemption is that it applies to "any single-family house sold or rented by an owner... or any person who owns and occupies one of the units... provided that the building has four or fewer units." So in this case, she owns a four-unit building, lives in one, so the exemption applies, meaning the Fair Housing Act does not apply. So the Act wouldn't apply, meaning her ad isn't a violation.

Wait, but that changes everything. So if the exemption applies, then the Fair Housing Act doesn't apply. So the woman's actions wouldn't be a violation under federal law. So which option would that correspond to?

Looking back at the options, option H says there are no violations of any federal laws. If the exemption applies, then yes, no federal violation. But earlier I thought the exemption applies only to owner-occupied buildings with four or fewer units, so she is exempt, and thus her ad isn't a violation.

Wait, but the question states that she owns a four-unit building and lives in one. So if the building is four units, and she's the owner and lives in one, then the exemption applies. Therefore, the Fair Housing Act doesn't apply, so her ad isn't a violation under federal law.

So then the correct answer would be H: There are no violations of any federal laws under these facts.

Wait, but earlier I thought the ad was a violation. So I'm a bit confused.

Let me clarify the exemption again. The Fair Housing Act's exemption is in 42 U.S.C. § 3603(b)(1): "the rental of a room or suite in a single-family house by the owner thereof, if the owner actually maintains and occupies the property as his or her residence." Or (b)(2): "the rental of a single-family house or a unit in a duplex, or a room or suite in a duplex, if the owner maintains and occupies the property as his or her residence."

Wait, no, the actual text is:

(b) Applicability to certain rooms and units. After December 31, 1968, the provisions of this subchapter shall apply to— 

(1) all dwellings except as exempted by subsection (b) of this section.

Wait, no, the exemption is in subsection (b):

(b) Exemptions. Nothing in this subchapter shall prohibit any person from— 

(1) refusing to sell or rent a dwelling to a person who would be the first occupant of such dwelling after the construction or rehabilitation thereof if such person imposes terms or conditions on the sale or rental which are not discriminatory within the meaning of this subchapter.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm confusing it with another part. Let me check the correct exemptions.

The correct exemptions are:

- The rental of a single-family house or a unit in a duplex or a room in a single-family house, if the owner lives there.

So, if the building has four units, and the owner lives in one, then the exemption would not apply because it's more than a duplex. So the Fair Housing Act would apply.

Wait, no, duplex means two units, so four units would be beyond that. So in this case, the building has four units, so the exemption doesn't apply, and the Fair Housing Act does apply. Therefore, the ad is a violation.

So back to the options, option B would be correct.

But wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me think again.

The exemption applies to "the rental of a room or suite in a single-family house, or a unit in a duplex, if the owner occupies the property as his residence." So four units would not qualify, so the exemption doesn't apply. Therefore, the Fair Housing Act applies, and her ad is a violation.

So the correct answer is B: Under the federal Fair Housing Act, the woman was not permitted to state a racial or gender preference in the advertisement.

Another angle: Even if the exemption applied, the ad would still be a problem. Because some courts have held that even exempt properties are still subject to the advertising provisions. Wait, no, the exemption would mean the Act doesn't apply at all, so advertising wouldn't be a violation.

But in this case, the building has four units, so the exemption doesn't apply. Therefore, the ad is a violation.

So the correct answer is B.

The question revolves around whether the woman's advertisement violates the federal Fair Housing Act. The advertisement states a preference for a "white male," which implicates prohibitions against racial and gender discrimination in housing. The Fair Housing Act applies to most housing providers, including private landlords, unless specific exemptions apply. 

The exemption in question applies to owner-occupied buildings with four or fewer units. In this case, the woman owns a four-unit building and lives in one unit. However, the exemption does not apply because the building has more than two units (it is not a duplex), and the exemption is limited to single-family homes, duplexes, or rooms in single-family homes. Since the building has four units, the Fair Housing Act applies, and the advertisement violates federal law by stating a racial and gender preference.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The Fair Housing Act applies to private landlords in most cases, including this one, as the exemption does not apply.
- **Option B**: Correct. The advertisement violates the Fair Housing Act by stating a racial and gender preference, which is prohibited.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The violation is under federal law, not just state law.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The advertisement itself is a violation, regardless of whether she refuses to rent to someone based on race or gender.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. Promoting diversity does not justify discriminatory preferences under the Fair Housing Act.
- **Option F**: Correct in substance but not directly addressing the advertisement. The advertisement is a separate violation.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Her motive does not absolve her of liability under the Fair Housing Act.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. There is a federal violation due to the advertisement.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The advertisement is illegal regardless of whether she acts on the preference.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The exemption for primary residences does not apply here because the building has four units.

The correct answer is **B**, as the advertisement violates the Fair Housing Act by stating a racial and gender preference.

Answer: B
