Okay, so I've got this probability problem here about tossing two dice and figuring out the chance that the sum is either 6 or 7. Hmm, I think I remember that when dealing with two dice, each die has 6 faces, so the total number of possible outcomes is 6 times 6, which is 36. That makes sense because each die is independent, right?

Now, the question is asking for the probability that the sum is 6 or 7. So I need to find all the possible combinations where the two dice add up to 6 or 7. Let me list them out.

Starting with a sum of 6. What are the possible pairs (first die, second die) that add up to 6?

Well, if the first die is 1, the second has to be 5: (1,5).
If the first is 2, second is 4: (2,4).
First is 3, second is 3: (3,3).
First is 4, second is 2: (4,2).
First is 5, second is 1: (5,1).
Wait, that's five combinations for a sum of 6. So that's 5 outcomes.

Now for the sum of 7. Let's see. If the first die is 1, the second must be 6: (1,6).
First die 2, second 5: (2,5).
First 3, second 4: (3,4).
First 4, second 3: (4,3).
First 5, second 2: (5,2).
First 6, second 1: (6,1).
That's six combinations for a sum of 7.

So total favorable outcomes are 5 (for 6) +6 (for7) =11.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. For sum of 6, I had 5, and for 7, 6. 5+6 is indeed 11. So that's 11 outcomes where the sum is 6 or7.

The total possible outcomes are 36, as each die has 6 sides. So the probability is 11/36.

Looking back at the options, option J is 11/36. So I think that's the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any combinations. For sum=6: (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1). Yep, that's five. Sum=7: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1). Six. So 5+6=11. Yeah, that's right.

So the probability is 11/36, which is option J.

To determine the probability that the sum of two dice is 6 or 7, we first calculate the total number of possible outcomes. Since each die has 6 faces, the total number of outcomes is:

\[
6 \times 6 = 36
\]

Next, we identify the favorable outcomes where the sum is 6 or 7.

**For a sum of 6:**  
The possible pairs are:  
\((1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1)\).  
This gives **5 outcomes**.

**For a sum of 7:**  
The possible pairs are:  
\((1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1)\).  
This gives **6 outcomes**.

Adding these together, the total number of favorable outcomes is:  
\[
5 + 6 = 11
\]

The probability is then the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:  
\[
\frac{11}{36}
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is **J: 11/36**.
