Okay, so I've got this question about hostile aggression, and I need to figure out which option best illustrates it. Hmm, let me think. I remember that aggression can be categorized into two types: hostile and instrumental. Hostile aggression is driven by emotion, like anger, and the goal is to hurt someone. On the other hand, instrumental aggression is more about achieving a specific goal, even if it involves harming others.

Looking at the options:

Option A: An employee sabotages a coworker's project out of jealousy. That seems emotional. Jealousy is a strong emotion, so maybe this is hostile because the intent is to harm the coworker's work due to personal feelings.

Option B: A waitress breaking cups and saucers when dropping a tray. That sounds like an accident. She didn't intend to break them; it's more careless or clumsy, not necessarily aggressive.

Option C: A teacher grading harshly because of a personal grudge. That's using their position to harm the student's grades, which seems intentional and emotional. Definitely hostile because the teacher is angry or resentful.

Option D: A man slapping his wife because she made hamburgers again. That's a clear act of anger leading to physical harm. The emotion of frustration or anger is driving the aggressive act.

Option E: A sanitation worker knocking over bushes when throwing a can. That seems accidental or careless, not intended to harm.

Option F: A careless driver hitting a pedestrian. That's more about recklessness rather than hostile intent. The driver might not have intended to harm, but was just not paying attention.

Wait, but I need to be careful. Hostile aggression is about intent to harm driven by emotion. So options A, C, D all involve intent to harm based on emotions. The question is which one best illustrates it.

Let me think again. Hostile aggression is typically impulsive and driven by anger. So the man slapping his wife (D) is a direct, impulsive act of violence in the heat of anger. Similarly, the teacher (C) is acting out of a grudge, which is a form of hostile aggression. The employee sabotaging (A) is also hostile, but it's more premeditated perhaps.

The question is about the best illustration. So which one is more clearly driven by emotion and intent to harm?

I think D is a clear case because it's a physical act of aggression in response to immediate anger. The others might involve more premeditation or other factors, but D is straightforward hostile aggression.

Hostile aggression is characterized by intentional harm driven by emotions such as anger or resentment. Among the options, Option D best illustrates hostile aggression. It involves a man slapping his wife out of anger, which is a direct, impulsive act of violence driven by emotion. This makes it the clearest example of hostile aggression compared to other options, which may involve more premeditation or different motivations.

Answer: D
