Okay, so I've got this problem here about tiling a floor, and I need to figure out how many tiles are needed and the total cost. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the problem says the floor is 9 feet long and 6 feet wide. The tiles are 9 inches by 9 inches each. Hmm, wait, the units aren't the same. The floor is measured in feet, and the tiles in inches. I need to convert them to the same unit system to calculate the area properly.

I remember that 1 foot is 12 inches. So, to convert the floor's dimensions to inches, I'll multiply each by 12. 

The length is 9 feet. 9 feet * 12 inches/foot = 108 inches. Similarly, the width is 6 feet, so 6 * 12 = 72 inches. 

So the floor's area is length times width. That's 108 inches * 72 inches. Let me calculate that. 108 *72... 100*72 is 7200, and 8*72 is 576, so total is 7200+576=7776 square inches.

Each tile is 9 inches by 9 inches, so the area of one tile is 9 *9 = 81 square inches.

To find out how many tiles are needed, I'll divide the total floor area by the area of one tile. So 7776 / 81. Let me compute that. Hmm, 81 goes into 7776 how many times? Well, 81 * 90 is 7290. Subtract that from 7776: 7776-7290=486. 486 divided by 81 is 6. So total tiles are 90 +6=96. So 96 tiles. Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check that math.

Wait, 81 times 96 equals... let's see, 80*96 is 7680, and 1*96 is 96, so 7680+96=7776. Oh right, so 96 tiles exactly. So no need for extra tiles, which is nice.

Now, each tile costs 75 cents, which is $0.75. So the total cost is 96 * 0.75. Let me calculate that. 96 * 0.75 is the same as 96 * (3/4). 96 divided by 4 is 24, multiplied by 3 is 72. So $72.

Looking at the options, option E is 96 tiles, $72. So the answer should be E.

To determine how many 9-inch-by-9-inch tiles are needed to cover a floor that is 9 feet long and 6 feet wide, first convert the floor's dimensions from feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches:

- Length: \( 9 \, \text{feet} \times 12 \, \frac{\text{inches}}{\text{foot}} = 108 \, \text{inches} \)
- Width: \( 6 \, \text{feet} \times 12 \, \frac{\text{inches}}{\text{foot}} = 72 \, \text{inches} \)

The area of the floor is then:

\[
\text{Area of floor} = 108 \, \text{inches} \times 72 \, \text{inches} = 7776 \, \text{square inches}.
\]

Each tile has an area of:

\[
\text{Area of one tile} = 9 \, \text{inches} \times 9 \, \text{inches} = 81 \, \text{square inches}.
\]

The number of tiles required is:

\[
\text{Number of tiles} = \frac{\text{Area of floor}}{\text{Area of one tile}} = \frac{7776}{81} = 96 \, \text{tiles}.
\]

Each tile costs $0.75, so the total cost is:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 96 \times 0.75 = \$72.00.
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is **E: 96 tiles, \$72.00**.
