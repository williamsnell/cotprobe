Okay, so I have this math problem here: When (x times the square root of x cubed) all raised to the fourth power is simplified, what's the exponent of x? The options are from A to J, and I need to figure it out.

Hmm, let's break it down step by step. First, I remember that when dealing with exponents, there are certain rules to follow. Like, when you have a power raised to another power, you multiply the exponents. Also, roots can be expressed as fractional exponents.

So the expression is (x * sqrt(x^3))^4. Let me rewrite that for clarity. The square root of x^3 is the same as (x^3)^(1/2). So inside the parentheses, it's x multiplied by x^(3*(1/2)). Wait, because when you raise a power to another, you multiply the exponents. So 3 times 1/2 is 3/2. That makes the second term x^(3/2).

So inside the parentheses, I have x which is x^1 multiplied by x^(3/2). When you multiply like bases with exponents, you add the exponents. So 1 + 3/2 equals... let's see, 1 is 2/2, so 2/2 + 3/2 is 5/2. So the inside simplifies to x^(5/2).

Now, the entire expression is that quantity raised to the 4th power. So (x^(5/2))^4. Again, when raising a power to a power, multiply exponents. So 5/2 *4. Let me compute that: 5/2 *4 is same as (5*4)/2, which is 20/2, which equals 10. So the exponent is 10.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the steps. Let's go through it again.

Original expression: (x * sqrt(x^3))^4.

sqrt(x^3) is x^(3/2). So x * x^(3/2) is x^(1 + 3/2) = x^(5/2). Then (x^(5/2))^4 is x^(5/2 *4) = x^10. Yeah, that seems right.

Looking at the options, option I is 10. So the answer should be I.

To simplify \((x\sqrt{x^3})^4\) and determine the exponent of \(x\), we proceed as follows:

1. Rewrite the square root as a fractional exponent:  
   \[
   \sqrt{x^3} = (x^3)^{1/2} = x^{3/2}.
   \]

2. Combine \(x\) (which is \(x^1\)) and \(x^{3/2}\) inside the parentheses. When multiplying like bases, add the exponents:  
   \[
   x^1 \cdot x^{3/2} = x^{1 + 3/2} = x^{5/2}.
   \]

3. Raise the result to the 4th power. When raising a power to another power, multiply the exponents:  
   \[
   (x^{5/2})^4 = x^{(5/2) \cdot 4} = x^{10}.
   \]

Thus, the exponent of \(x\) in the simplified expression is 10.

The correct answer is **I: 10**.
