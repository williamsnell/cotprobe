Okay, so I've got this problem about bonds, and I'm a bit rusty on my bond math, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the price of a 5-year zero-coupon bond based on two other bonds provided. Let me see.

So, the problem states that there are two 5-year bonds. The first has a 9% coupon and sells for $101.00. The second has a 7% coupon and sells for $93.20. I need to find the price of a 5-year zero-coupon bond. The options are from A to J, with various prices listed.

Hmm, zero-coupon bonds are different because they don't pay interest during their life; instead, they're sold at a discount and pay face value at maturity. So, the price of a zero-coupon bond would be the present value of the face value.

I remember that the price of a bond is the sum of the present values of its cash flows. For a regular coupon bond, that's the sum of each coupon payment plus the face value, all discounted back to the present. For the zero-coupon, it's just the face value discounted.

Wait, but how do I find the discount rate (the market interest rate) to use for this? Oh, right, because both the given bonds have different coupons but the same maturity, I can use them to solve for the spot rate (the yield-to-maturity for zero-coupon bonds) for the 5-year period. Once I have that rate, I can discount the face value (say, $100) to find the zero-coupon bond's price.

So, let me structure this. Let's denote the 5-year spot rate as r. For each coupon bond, their price is the sum of the present values of their coupons plus the return of principal, all discounted at rate r.

Let me represent this with equations. Let's assume the face value is $100 for both bonds. So:

For the first bond (9% coupon, price $101):
101 = (9*100)/(1+r) + (9*100)/(1+r)^2 + (9*100)/(1+r)^3 + (9*100)/(1+r)^4 + (109*100)/(1+r)^5

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the first bond's price is 101. So, wait, actually, each coupon is 9% of face value. So for a 5-year bond, each coupon is 9 per year. The face value is 100, so at maturity, you get 100 + 9 = 109.

Wait, but that's confusing. No, wait, the coupon is 9% annually, so each coupon is 9 dollars (since face is 100). So the cash flows are 9, 9, 9, 9, and 109 in the fifth year. So the price is the sum of each cash flow discounted at r.

Similarly, for the second bond (7%, price 93.20), the cash flows are 7, 7, 7, 7, and 107.

So, I can set up two equations:

101 = 9/(1+r) + 9/(1+r)^2 + 9/(1+r)^3 + 9/(1+r)^4 + 109/(1+r)^5 ...(1)

93.20 = 7/(1+r) + 7/(1+r)^2 + 7/(1+r)^3 + 7/(1+r)^4 + 107/(1+r)^5 ...(2)

Wait, but both equations have the same r, the 5-year spot rate. So, I can solve either equation for r and then use that r to find the zero-coupon bond's price.

Alternatively, maybe I can subtract the two equations to simplify. Let me think.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute r using one of the bonds. Let's pick one equation and solve for r numerically. Let me try the first bond.

So equation (1):

101 = 9*(1/(1+r) + 1/(1+r)^2 + 1/(1+r)^3 + 1/(1+r)^4) + 100/(1+r)^5 + 9/(1+r)^5.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute each term. Alternatively, perhaps I can approximate the rate.

Alternatively, perhaps using a financial calculator approach. Let me think about the formula.

The present value of a bond is the sum of the present value of the coupons and the present value of the face value. For a zero-coupon bond, it's just the face value discounted at rate r for 5 years.

So, for the first bond, the price is 101 = sum of the coupons (each 9, for 5 years) plus the face value (100), all discounted at r.

The sum of the coupons is an annuity of 9 per year for 5 years. The present value of that annuity is 9 * [1 - (1/(1+r)^5)] / r. Then, the present value of the face value is 100/(1+r)^5. So equation (1) becomes:

101 = 9*(1 - (1/(1+r)^5))/r + 100/(1+r)^5.

Similarly, equation (2) is:

93.20 = 7*(1 - (1/(1+r)^5))/r + 100/(1+r)^5.

Wait, but both equations have the same r. But wait, no, each coupon bond has its own yield. Hmm, wait, but wait, I thought we were assuming that the spot rate is the same for both. But that might not be the case. Hmm, maybe I confused something here. Because the spot rate is for zero-coupon bonds, and each coupon bond's price is determined by discounting their cash flows at the spot rates for each period. But perhaps for simplicity, the question assumes that the market is such that the same 5-year spot rate applies to both. Or maybe the question is treating both as having the same yield to maturity, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that the correct approach to find the spot rate is to use the bond with more cash flows, but maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the two different bonds can be used to solve for the spot rate. But this might be complicated, as each bond's cash flows would have different present values based on the spot rates for each year. But since both bonds are 5-year, perhaps the spot rate for 5 years is the same in both cases.

Alternatively, maybe I can make an assumption that the yield to maturity (r) is the same for both bonds because they have the same maturity and are both priced in the market. Wait, but that can't be correct because bonds with different coupons can have different yields. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, perhaps the question expects me to calculate the yield of each bond and then find an average or something. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the question wants me to find the spot rate using the given bond prices and then use that spot rate to compute the zero-coupon bond's price.

Wait, but the problem is that each coupon bond's price is determined by discounting each cash flow at the corresponding spot rate for that maturity. For example, the first year's coupon is discounted at the 1-year spot rate, the second at the 2-year, etc. So, it's more complicated than a single discount rate.

But perhaps the question is making a simplification by assuming that the same discount rate applies to all cash flows, which would be the yield to maturity approach. So, perhaps the question is using the yield to maturity (YTM) for each bond, and then from that, we can find the spot rate. But I'm a bit confused.

Wait, maybe I should proceed with the YTM approach for each bond and then see if that can help me find the zero-coupon bond's price.

Taking the first bond: 9% coupon, 5 years, price 101. So, YTM r1 satisfies:

101 = 9/(1+r1) + 9/(1+r1)^2 + 9/(1+r1)^3 + 9/(1+r1)^4 + 109/(1+r1)^5.

Similarly for the second bond: 7%, price 93.2.

93.2 = 7/(1+r2) + 7/(1+r2)^2 + 7/(1+r2)^3 + 7/(1+r2)^4 + 107/(1+r2)^5.

But since both are 5-year bonds, perhaps their YTMs are the same? No, that can't be right because their coupons are different. So, each will have a different YTM.

Wait, but zero-coupon bonds have their entire return as capital gain (or loss), so their price is simply face value divided by (1 + r)^n, where r is the spot rate for n years.

So, perhaps to find the 5-year spot rate, I need to calculate it using one of the bonds, but since each bond's cash flows are discounted at different spot rates, it's more accurate to model each cash flow with its respective spot rate. However, that's complicated without more information.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is oversimplified, and it's assuming that the YTM of each bond is the same as the 5-year spot rate, which would allow us to compute it from one bond.

Wait, but if that's the case, let's pick one bond and compute its YTM, then use that rate to compute the zero-coupon bond's price.

Let me try with the first bond, the 9% coupon priced at 101.

So, equation is:

101 = 9/(1+r) + 9/(1+r)^2 + 9/(1+r)^3 + 9/(1+r)^4 + 109/(1+r)^5.

This is a bit tedious to solve manually, but maybe I can approximate r.

Let me try r = 8%. Let's compute each term:

9/(1.08) ≈ 8.333
9/(1.08)^2 ≈ 9/(1.1664) ≈ 7.711
9/(1.08)^3 ≈ 9/(1.2597) ≈ 7.140
9/(1.08)^4 ≈ 9/(1.3605) ≈ 6.614
109/(1.08)^5 ≈ 109/(1.4693) ≈ 74.190

Sum: 8.333 +7.711=16.044 +7.140=23.184 +6.614=29.798 +74.190=103.988. So total is about 103.99, which is higher than 101. So, the actual r is higher than 8%, because at 8%, the PV is 103.99, which is higher than 101. So, we need a higher r to bring the PV down to 101.

Let's try r=9%:

9/(1.09) ≈8.256
9/(1.09)^2≈9/(1.1881)=7.568
9/(1.09)^3≈9/(1.2950)=6.964
9/(1.09)^4≈9/(1.4119)=6.383
109/(1.09)^5≈109/(1.5386)=70.86.

Adding them: 8.256 +7.568=15.824 +6.964=22.788 +6.383=29.171 +70.86=100.031. Close to 101, but a bit low. At 9%, PV is around 100.03, which is less than 101, so the actual r is between 8% and 9%.

Wait, at 8%, PV was 103.99, at 9% it's 100.03. We need to find r where PV is 101.

Let me try r=8.5%.

At 8.5%:

9/(1.085) ≈8.377
9/(1.085)^2: 1.085^2≈1.177, 9/1.177≈7.646
9/(1.085)^3: 1.085^3≈1.085*1.177≈1.276, 9/1.276≈7.051
9/(1.085)^4: 1.085^4≈1.276*1.085≈1.386, 9/1.386≈6.494
109/(1.085)^5: 1.085^5≈1.386*1.085≈1.505, 109/1.505≈72.40.

Sum: 8.377 +7.646=16.023 +7.051=23.074 +6.494=29.568 +72.40=101.968. So the PV is approximately 101.97 at 8.5%, which is very close to 101. So r is about 8.5%.

But wait, at 8.5%, the PV is about 101.97, which is a bit higher than 101. So, the actual rate is slightly higher than 8.5%.

Let me try r=8.6%.

Compute each term:

9/(1.086): 1.086 ≈ 1.086.

1.086^1 =1.086 → 9/1.086≈8.289.

1.086^2≈1.086*1.086≈1.179 → 9/1.179≈7.632.

1.086^3≈1.179*1.086≈1.281 →9/1.281≈7.024.

1.086^4≈1.281*1.086≈1.393 →9/1.393≈6.456.

1.086^5≈1.393*1.086≈1.513 →109/1.513≈72.03.

Now sum them: 8.289 +7.632=15.921 +7.024=22.945 +6.456=29.401 +72.03=101.431. So at 8.6%, PV is around 101.43, which is a bit above 101.

We need PV to be 101, so perhaps r is around 8.6% to 8.7%.

Let me try r=8.65%:

Compute each term:

1.0865^1 =1.0865 →9/1.0865≈8.28.

1.0865^2=1.0865 *1.0865 ≈1.177 →Wait, better to compute more accurately.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use linear approximation between 8.5% and 8.6%.

At 8.5%: PV=101.97.

At 8.6%: PV=101.43.

We need PV=101. So, the difference between 8.5% and 8.6% is 101.97 to 101.43, which is a decrease of about 0.54 over 0.1% increase in r.

We need to decrease from 101.97 to 101, which is a decrease of 0.97. So, the fraction is 0.97 / 0.54 ≈1.8, so 0.18% increase beyond 8.5% →r≈8.68%.

But this is getting complicated, and perhaps beyond the level of the question. Alternatively, maybe the question expects me to use one of the given bonds to compute the spot rate and then use that to find the zero's price.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use both bonds to create equations and solve for r. Let me try that.

Let me denote the spot rate as r. Then, each cash flow is discounted at r^n, where n is the year.

Wait, but that's not correct. Each cash flow at year n is discounted at the n-year spot rate, which could be different. So, for a 5-year bond, each coupon payment is discounted at r1, r2, r3, r4, r5 respectively, where r1 is the 1-year spot rate, r2 the 2-year, etc. But without more information, I can't solve for all these rates. So maybe the question is making an assumption that the same discount rate applies to all cash flows, which would be the YTM approach, even though that's not strictly accurate for spot rates.

So, perhaps the intended approach is to compute the YTM for each bond and then average them, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe the spot rate is the same as the YTM for the zero-coupon bond, so we can compute it from the given coupon bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to model the price of each coupon bond as the sum of zero-coupon bonds. For example, the 9% coupon bond's price is the sum of the present values of each coupon payment and the face value, each discounted at their respective spot rates.

But without knowing the individual spot rates, I can't compute the exact spot rate for 5 years. So perhaps the question expects me to assume that the 5-year spot rate is the same as the YTM of one of the bonds, but that might not be accurate.

Wait, perhaps I can make another approach. Let's consider that the zero-coupon bond's price is the present value of $100 at the 5-year spot rate. So, if I can find r_5, the 5-year spot rate, then the price would be 100/(1 + r_5)^5.

To find r_5, maybe I can use the information from the two coupon bonds. Let me model each coupon bond's price as the sum of the present values of their cash flows, each discounted at their respective spot rates.

For the first bond (9% coupon), the price is:

101 = 9/(1 + r1) + 9/(1 + r2)^2 + 9/(1 + r3)^3 + 9/(1 + r4)^4 + 109/(1 + r5)^5.

Similarly, the second bond (7% coupon):

93.2 =7/(1 + r1) +7/(1 + r2)^2 +7/(1 + r3)^3 +7/(1 + r4)^4 + 107/(1 + r5)^5.

But without knowing the other spot rates (r1 to r4), this seems impossible. So perhaps the question is expecting me to make an assumption that all spot rates are the same, which would be equivalent to using the YTM approach. Then, I can solve equation (1) and equation (2) for r and see if they give the same rate.

Wait, but when I tried the first bond earlier, the YTM was around 8.68%. Let's try the second bond with equation (2) to see what YTM we get.

Equation (
