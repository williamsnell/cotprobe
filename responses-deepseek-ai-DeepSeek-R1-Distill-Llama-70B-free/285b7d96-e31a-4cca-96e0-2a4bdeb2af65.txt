Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Singer's argument and which traditional distinction it upsets. I'm a bit rusty on philosophy, but I'll try to think this through step by step.

First, I remember that Peter Singer is a philosopher known for his work in ethics, particularly in areas like animal rights, effective altruism, and bioethics. His arguments often challenge conventional thinking, so the question is about which specific distinction he upsets.

The options are A through J, each pairing two concepts. I'll need to recall Singer's main arguments to figure out which pair he challenges.

I think Singer is known for his utilitarian approach. Utilitarianism is about maximizing overall happiness or utility. In his book "Famine, Affluence, and Morality," he argues that people have a moral obligation to help those in need, even if they are strangers or far away. This is where the distinction between duty and charity comes in.

Traditionally, people might see charity as optionalâ€”something you do if you want to help, but it's not a duty. Duty, on the other hand, is a moral obligation you must fulfill. Singer's argument blurs this line, suggesting that helping others isn't just a charitable act but a moral duty. So he's upsetting the distinction between duty and charity.

Looking at the options, option C is "duty and charity." That seems to fit what I was thinking.

Let me double-check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something. Option D is positive and negative rights, which relates more to rights that require action (positive) versus those that require non-interference (negative). I don't think that's directly related to Singer's main point here.

Option I is egoism and altruism. Egoism is acting in self-interest, altruism is acting for others' benefit. While Singer does promote altruism, the question is about the distinction he upsets, not just promoting one side.

So I'm pretty confident the answer is option C.

The question asks which traditional distinction Singer's argument upsets. Singer, known for his utilitarian approach, challenges the conventional separation of duty and charity. He argues that helping others is not just an optional charitable act but a moral duty, thus blurring this distinction. 

Option C: duty and charity, aligns with this reasoning. Other options, like positive and negative rights or egoism and altruism, don't directly relate to Singer's main argument in this context.

Answer: C
