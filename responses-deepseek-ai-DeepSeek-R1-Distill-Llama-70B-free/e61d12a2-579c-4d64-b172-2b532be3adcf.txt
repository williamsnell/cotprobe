Okay, so I have this problem here about probability density functions. Hmm, let me see what it's asking. The function given is g(x) = (1 + x²)^-1. They want me to find a constant k such that f(x) = k(1 + x²)^-1 becomes a proper probability density function for all real x. Then I also need to find F(x), the cumulative distribution function, which is the probability that X is less than or equal to x.

Alright, let's start with the first part. I remember that for a function to be a probability density function (pdf), the integral over all possible x must equal 1. So the integral of f(x) from negative infinity to positive infinity should be 1. Since f(x) is k times g(x), that means k times the integral of g(x) over the real line must equal 1.

So I'll need to compute the integral of (1 + x²)^-1 dx from -infinity to infinity. Wait, I think I remember that the integral of 1/(1+x²) dx is arctangent(x) + C. Because the derivative of arctan(x) is 1/(1+x²). So evaluating from -infty to infty, arctan(inf) is π/2 and arctan(-inf) is -π/2. So the difference would be π/2 - (-π/2) = π.

So the integral of g(x) from -infty to infty is π. Therefore, when we set k times π equal to 1, because the total probability must be 1. So solving for k gives k = 1/π. So I think the correct k is 1/π, which would make f(x) = (1/π)(1 + x²)^-1.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I is 1/π. So that must be the answer for the first part. But wait, the question also asks for F(x), the CDF. So I need to find F(x) = P(X ≤ x), which is the integral of f(t) dt from -infinity to x.

So F(x) would be the integral from -infty to x of [1/(π(1 + t²))] dt. As I thought earlier, the integral of 1/(1 + t²) dt is arctan(t). So evaluating from -infty to x gives [arctan(x) - arctan(-infty)] / π. Arctan(-infty) is -π/2, so arctan(x) - (-π/2) = arctan(x) + π/2. Therefore, F(x) = [arctan(x) + π/2]/π. Simplifying that, it's (1/π)(arctan(x) + π/2). Alternatively, it can be written as (1/π) arctan(x) + 1/2.

Wait, but let me double-check that. The integral from a to b of f(t) dt is F(b) - F(a). So when a is -infty, F(a) would be zero because it's the lower limit of the CDF. So F(x) = (1/π) * [arctan(x) - arctan(-infty)].

Wait a second, arctan(-infty) is -π/2, right? So substituting, it's [arctan(x) - (-π/2)] = arctan(x) + π/2. So F(x) = (arctan(x) + π/2)/π. That simplifies to (arctan(x))/π + (π/2)/π, which is (arctan(x))/π + 1/2. So yes, F(x) is (arctan(x) + π/2) divided by π.

But wait, the question only asks for the value of k, right? Because the options are just the possible constants. So the answer for k is 1/π, which is option I. So I think the correct answer is I.

To determine the constant \( k \) such that \( f(x) = k(1 + x^2)^{-1} \) is a proper probability density function (pdf) over \( -\infty < x < \infty \), we require that the total integral of \( f(x) \) over the real line equals 1. This means:

\[
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) \, dx = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{k}{1 + x^2} \, dx = 1.
\]

The integral of \( \frac{1}{1 + x^2} \) is known to be \( \arctan(x) \). Evaluating this from \( -\infty \) to \( \infty \), we find:

\[
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{1}{1 + x^2} \, dx = \arctan(x) \Big|_{-\infty}^{\infty} = \frac{\pi}{2} - \left(-\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = \pi.
\]

Thus, the integral of \( f(x) \) becomes \( k \cdot \pi \). Setting this equal to 1 gives:

\[
k \cdot \pi = 1 \quad \implies \quad k = \frac{1}{\pi}.
\]

Therefore, the constant \( k \) is \( \frac{1}{\pi} \), which corresponds to option I.

To find the cumulative distribution function \( F(x) = P(X \leq x) \), we compute the integral of \( f(x) \) from \( -\infty \) to \( x \):

\[
F(x) = \int_{-\infty}^x f(t) \, dt = \int_{-\infty}^x \frac{1}{\pi(1 + t^2)} \, dt.
\]

The integral of \( \frac{1}{1 + t^2} \) is \( \arctan(t) \), so:

\[
F(x) = \frac{1}{\pi} \left[ \arctan(x) - \arctan(-\infty) \right].
\]

Since \( \arctan(-\infty) = -\frac{\pi}{2} \), this simplifies to:

\[
F(x) = \frac{1}{\pi} \left[ \arctan(x) + \frac{\pi}{2} \right].
\]

Thus, \( F(x) = \frac{\arctan(x) + \frac{\pi}{2}}{\pi} \).

The problem specifically asks for the constant \( k \), which is \( \frac{1}{\pi} \), corresponding to option I.
