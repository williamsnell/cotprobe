Question:

Which statement best describes the circumstances that have shaped the emergence of peace studies as a field of research?

Options:

A: Peace studies developed after the Second World War as a response to the failure of International Relations to prevent global conflict following World War I. Initially, the field was conditioned by the nuclear arms race and East-West divide that characterised the Cold War, but was quick to embrace environmental concerns and the issues surrounding the North-South wealth/poverty divide.
B: Peace studies developed during the 1960s and 1970s as a reaction to the civil rights movement and anti-war protests, focusing on social justice issues and the role of nonviolent resistance in promoting peace.
C: Developed as a response to World War I, peace studies focuses on disparities in wealth and resource allocation that exist within the global system, with the aim of promoting peace through the equal distribution of these resources.
D: The field of peace studies emerged during the Cold War, primarily focusing on the East-West divide and the potential for nuclear war, with a secondary focus on the impact of war on the environment.
E: Peace studies emerged as a field of research in the post-Cold War era, largely driven by the need to understand and address the root causes of internal conflicts and civil wars.
F: Developed during the era of decolonization, peace studies focuses on the legacy of colonialism and its impact on conflicts and tensions in the global South.
G: Peace studies developed as a discipline following the Cold War when the security studies paradigm shifted to include areas of concern such as environmental, societal and economic security. As a field of research peace studies adopts a Euro-centric approach to security and has thus been defined by developments within the West and wealthier nations.
H: Peace studies emerged as a response to the developing nuclear capability of states during the Cold War. The aim of peace studies is to secure the state as a referent object and does this through the study of weapons accumulation. The approach is particularly focused on the nuclear arms race between East and West.
I: Peace studies emerged in the aftermath of the Vietnam War, primarily focusing on the issues surrounding war atrocities and the impact of war on civilian populations.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about peace studies and its emergence. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that peace studies is an interdisciplinary field that focuses on the causes of conflict and ways to achieve peace. It's related to international relations but has a distinct focus.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it developed after WWII as a response to International Relations failing to prevent conflict after WWI. It mentions the Cold War context, nuclear arms race, and East-West divide. Also, it quickly included environmental and North-South issues.

Option B talks about the 60s and 70s, civil rights, and anti-war protests, focusing on social justice and nonviolent resistance.

Option C links it to WWI, focusing on wealth disparities and resource allocation.

Option D says it emerged during the Cold War, focusing on East-West and nuclear war, with some environmental impact.

Option E is post-Cold War, focusing on internal conflicts and civil wars.

Option F is during decolonization, focusing on colonialism's legacy in the global South.

Option G is post-Cold War, shifting security studies to include environmental, societal, and economic aspects, with a Euro-centric approach.

Option H is about the Cold War nuclear capabilities, focusing on securing the state through weapons accumulation.

Option I is post-Vietnam War, focusing on war atrocities and civilians.

Now, I think peace studies started gaining traction after WWII, especially considering the horrors of the war and the onset of the Cold War. The field initially was concerned with the nuclear arms race and the East-West tensions. But over time, it expanded to include other issues like environmental degradation and economic disparities between the North and South.

Option A seems to fit because it mentions the post-WWII emergence, the Cold War context, and the expansion into other areas like environmental and North-South issues. I don't think it's just about the 60s and 70s (so B is probably not the best). Option D doesn't mention the expansion beyond Cold War issues. Option E is about the post-Cold War era, which is later than the field's emergence.

So the best answer is probably A.

The emergence of peace studies as a field of research is best described by Option A. It accurately captures that peace studies developed after World War II, responding to the failure of International Relations to prevent global conflict following World War I. Initially shaped by the Cold War context, including the nuclear arms race and East-West divide, the field later expanded to address environmental concerns and the North-South wealth/poverty divide. This comprehensive timeline and scope make Option A the most fitting choice.

Answer: A
