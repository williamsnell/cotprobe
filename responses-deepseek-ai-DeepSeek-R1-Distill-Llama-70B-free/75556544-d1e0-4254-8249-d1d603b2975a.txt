Okay, so I've got this problem here about two cans of tuna fish, and I need to figure out which one is the better buy. Hmm, let me see. I remember that to find out which is better, I should probably calculate the cost per ounce for each can. That way, I can compare them directly.

Alright, the first can is 7 and a half ounces and costs 57 cents. The second can is 8 and a quarter ounces and sells for 64 cents. Wait, I need to convert those mixed numbers to decimals to make the calculation easier. So, 7 and a half ounces is 7.5 ounces, and 8 and a quarter is 8.25 ounces.

Now, for the first can, I divide the cost by the number of ounces. So, 57 cents divided by 7.5 ounces. Let me do that math. 57 divided by 7.5... Hmm, 7.5 times 7 is 52.5, and 57 minus 52.5 is 4.5. So that's 7.5 goes into 57 seven times with a remainder of 4.5. Wait, maybe it's easier to think of it as 57 divided by 7.5. Oh wait, 7.5 goes into 57 seven times because 7.5 * 7 is 52.5, and the remaining 4.5 divided by 7.5 is 0.6. So 7.6 cents per ounce? Wait, no, that can't be right because 7.5 times 7.6 would be way more than 57. I'm getting confused here.

Wait, maybe I should calculate it differently. Let's see, 57 divided by 7.5. To make it easier, maybe multiply numerator and denominator by 10 to eliminate the decimal. So, 570 divided by 75. Let's see, 75 goes into 570 how many times? 75 times 7 is 525, subtract that from 570, leaves 45. Bring down a zero, making it 450. 75 goes into 450 six times exactly. So that makes 7.6? Wait no, because 75 * 7.6 would be 75*(7 + 0.6) = 525 + 45 = 570. Oh wait, so 57/7.5 is 7.6. So that's 7.6 cents per ounce.

Wait, no, wait a second. 57 cents divided by 7.5 ounces is 7.6 cents per ounce. But wait, 7.6 cents per ounce seems a bit high, but maybe that's correct.

Now, the second can is 64 cents for 8.25 ounces. Let me compute that. So, 64 divided by 8.25. Again, maybe multiply numerator and denominator by 100 to get rid of the decimal. So 6400 divided by 825. Let me see, 825 times 7 is 5775. Subtract that from 6400: 6400 - 5775 = 625. Bring down a zero, making it 6250. 825 goes into 6250 how many times? Let's see, 825*7=5775 again, which leaves 6250-5775=475. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to think in terms of division.

Alternatively, 8.25 ounces is the same as 8 and 1/4, which is 33/4. So 64 divided by (33/4) is 64 * (4/33) = (64*4)/33 = 256/33. Let me compute that. 33 times 7 is 231, subtract from 256 gives 25. So 7 and 25/33, which is approximately 7.7576 cents per ounce.

Wait, so the first can is 7.6 cents per ounce, and the second is approximately 7.76 cents per ounce. Wait, that would mean the first can is cheaper per ounce. So the first can is a better buy.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake. Let me recalculate.

First can: 57 cents / 7.5 ounces.

57 divided by 7.5: 7.5 goes into 57 how many times? 7.5 * 7 is 52.5. 57 - 52.5 is 4.5. So 7 times with 4.5 remaining. Now, 4.5 divided by 7.5 is 0.6. So 7.6 cents per ounce. That's correct.

Second can: 64 / 8.25.

8.25 is 33/4, so 64 / (33/4) = 64 * (4/33) = 256/33. Let's compute 256 รท 33. 33 * 7 = 231. 256 - 231 = 25. So 7 and 25/33, which is approximately 7.7576. So yes, 7.76 cents per ounce.

So the first can is 7.6, the second is 7.76. Therefore, the first can is cheaper per ounce, so it's the better buy.

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I should calculate per ounce cost more accurately.

Alternatively, I can compute the unit price for each.

First can: 57 cents /7.5 oz = 7.6 cents per ounce.

Second can: 64 /8.25. Let me compute it as 8.25 * 7 = 57.75. 57.75 is less than 64. The difference is 64 -57.75=6.25. So 6.25/8.25 = 0.75. So 7 + 0.75 = 7.75 cents per ounce. Wait, that's 7.75. Oh, so 64/8.25 is exactly 7.75? Wait, 8.25 *7.75 = let's see. 8*7=56, 8*0.75=6, 0.25*7=1.75, 0.25*0.75=0.1875. Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Alternatively, 8.25 * x =64.

Wait, 8.25 * 7.75 = ?

Let me compute 8 *7.75=62, and 0.25 *7.75=1.9375. So total 62 +1.9375=63.9375, which is approximately 64. So yes, 8.25 *7.75=63.9375, which is roughly 64. So 64/8.25=7.75.

Wait, so first can is 7.6, second is 7.75. So the first can is cheaper per ounce.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: None of the cans

B: The first can

C: The second can is better by 7 cents per ounce

D: The second can is better by 5 cents per ounce

E: The second can is better only when buying in bulk

F: The first can is better by 10 cents per ounce

G: The second can

H: Both cans are better buys on alternate days

I: Both cans are the same

J: The first can is better when considering nutritional value

Wait, so from my calculation, the first can is better because it's cheaper per ounce. So the answer would be B: The first can.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Because sometimes when I'm dividing, it's easy to slip up.

First can: 57 cents /7.5 oz.

57 divided by 7.5.

Let me do it another way. 7.5 ounces is 15/2, so 57 divided by (15/2) is 57*(2/15)= (57*2)/15=114/15=7.6. So yes, correct.

Second can:64/8.25=64/(33/4)=64*4/33=256/33. Let me compute 256 รท33.

33*7=231, 256-231=25. So 7 and 25/33. 25/33 is approximately 0.7576. So 7.7576, which is about 7.76 cents per ounce.

So yes, first can is cheaper at 7.6 vs 7.76. So first can is better.

But wait, looking at the options, option B says "The first can" is the better buy. Option G says "The second can".

Wait, but wait, I think I might have miscalculated. Let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the price per ounce more accurately.

First can: 57 cents for 7.5 oz.

57 /7.5 = 7.6 cents per oz.

Second can: 64 /8.25 = ?

Let me compute 64 รท8.25.

8.25 *7 =57.75.

64-57.75=6.25.

So 6.25 /8.25 = 0.75.

So total is 7.75.

So yes, 7.75 cents per ounce.

Thus, first can is cheaper, so B is correct.

But wait, let's look at the options again. Option C says the second can is better by 7 cents per ounce. D says by 5. So that's not the case. So the correct answer is B.

To determine which can of tuna is the better buy, we calculate the cost per ounce for each can.

1. **First can**:  
   - Size: 7.5 ounces  
   - Cost: 57 cents  
   - Cost per ounce:  
     \[
     \frac{57 \text{ cents}}{7.5 \text{ ounces}} = 7.6 \text{ cents per ounce}
     \]

2. **Second can**:  
   - Size: 8.25 ounces  
   - Cost: 64 cents  
   - Cost per ounce:  
     \[
     \frac{64 \text{ cents}}{8.25 \text{ ounces}} = 7.75 \text{ cents per ounce}
     \]

Comparing the two, the first can has a lower cost per ounce (7.6 cents) than the second can (7.75 cents). Therefore, the first can is the better buy.

From the given options, the correct answer is **B: The first can**.
