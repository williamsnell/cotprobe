Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about preparing a specific concentration of HCl solution. The chemist wants to make 50 ml of a 11.6 M HCl solution with a pH of 1.25. Hmm, wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, let me read the question again.

Oh, right, the question says the chemist wants to make up a 50 ml solution of pH 1.25 using HCl that's labeled 11.6 M. So the goal is to prepare 50 mL of a solution with pH 1.25 from the concentrated 11.6 M HCl.

First, I think I need to find out the concentration of HCl required to get pH 1.25. Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely in water. So the concentration of H+ ions will be the same as the concentration of HCl.

The pH is given as 1.25. pH is the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration. So, I can calculate [H+] as 10^(-pH). Let me do that.

pH = 1.25 → [H+] = 10^(-1.25) = 10^(-1) * 10^(-0.25) = 0.1 * (approximately 0.5623) → around 0.05623 M. So the HCl concentration needs to be 0.05623 M because HCl is a strong acid and fully ionizes.

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, the concentration of HCl will equal the [H+] because it's a strong monoprotic acid. So yes, the HCl concentration should be 0.05623 M for the solution to have pH 1.25.

Now, the chemist has 11.6 M HCl, which is much stronger. She needs to dilute it to 0.05623 M in a total volume of 50 mL. So I should use the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

Here, M1 is 11.6 M, V1 is the volume of concentrated HCl needed, M2 is 0.05623 M, and V2 is 50 mL (0.05 L). Let's plug in the numbers.

11.6 * V1 = 0.05623 * 50 → 11.6 V1 = 2.8115 → So V1 = 2.8115 / 11.6 ≈ 0.2424 mL. Approximately 0.24 mL.

So she needs to take 0.24 mL of the 11.6 M HCl and dilute it to a total volume of 50 mL. That would mean adding water to make up the rest.

So the solution volume is 50 mL, and the HCl volume is 0.24 mL, so water added is 50 - 0.24 = 49.76 mL.

Looking at the options, option B says: Add 49.76 ml of H2O to 0.24 ml of concentrated HCl. That fits perfectly.

Let me check the other options just to be sure. Option A adds 50 ml of water to 0.24 ml HCl, which would make 50.24 ml total, which is more than needed. So that's wrong. Option E uses 0.1 ml HCl, which would be way too little. Others have different HCl volumes, so they don't match the calculation. So the correct answer must be B.

To prepare 50 mL of a solution with a pH of 1.25 using 11.6 M HCl, the chemist needs to determine the required concentration of HCl. Since HCl is a strong acid, the hydrogen ion concentration \([H^+]\) is equal to the HCl concentration. The pH is related to \([H^+]\) by the formula:

\[
\text{pH} = -\log[H^+]
\]

Given \(\text{pH} = 1.25\), we calculate:

\[
[H^+] = 10^{-1.25} = 10^{-1} \cdot 10^{-0.25} = 0.1 \cdot 0.5623 \approx 0.05623 \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the HCl concentration must be \(0.05623 \, \text{M}\). Using the dilution formula \(M_1V_1 = M_2V_2\), where \(M_1 = 11.6 \, \text{M}\), \(M_2 = 0.05623 \, \text{M}\), and \(V_2 = 50 \, \text{mL}\), the volume of concentrated HCl required (\(V_1\)) is:

\[
V_1 = \frac{M_2V_2}{M_1} = \frac{0.05623 \cdot 50}{11.6} \approx 0.2424 \, \text{mL} \approx 0.24 \, \text{mL}
\]

The total solution volume is 50 mL, so the volume of water to be added is:

\[
50 \, \text{mL} - 0.24 \, \text{mL} = 49.76 \, \text{mL}
\]

From the options provided, the correct procedure is to add 49.76 mL of water to 0.24 mL of concentrated HCl, which corresponds to **Option B**.
