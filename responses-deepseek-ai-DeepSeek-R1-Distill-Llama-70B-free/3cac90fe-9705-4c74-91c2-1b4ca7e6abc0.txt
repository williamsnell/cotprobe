Okay, so I've got this question about child language development, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's see what the question says.

The question is asking about changes in children's language-learning ability during the latter part of their first year. The options are A through I, and I need to pick the right one.

I remember that in the first year, babies start with cooing and then move to babbling. Babbling is when they make sounds similar to their native language. Then, around 12 months, they start saying their first words, like "mama" or "dada" specifically referring to people, not just random sounds.

Looking at the options:

Option A says they begin to utter words in an unsystematic and random manner. Wait, that doesn't sound right. I thought that before the first words, they babble, which is more systematic, like syllables with consonant-vowel patterns. So maybe A is incorrect.

Option B says they start to form full sentences. No, that's much later, like around 2-3 years old. So B is not right.

Option C suggests they produce more than they can comprehend. I think that's true for a bit later when they have a lot of vocabulary, but not sure if it's the latter part of the first year. Maybe not the best fit.

Option D: begin to utter their first words in a systematic way due to selective reinforcement of babbling. That makes sense. So caregivers might respond when the baby says something that sounds like a word, reinforcing it. So D seems plausible.

Option E: lose the ability to understand words. That doesn't make sense. Language comprehension starts developing before production, so E is probably wrong.

Option F: begin to be sensitive to speech rhythms. I think that's more about prosody and maybe earlier than the latter part. Not sure.

Option G: lose ability to perceive any sound distinctions. No, that's not right. Infants can perceive all sounds initially, but later they lose the ability to distinguish sounds not in their native language. So G is incorrect.

Option H: can perceive sound distinctions in multiple languages. Wait, I think that's true for younger infants. As they get older, they start to specialize in their native language sounds. So H might not be correct for the latter part of the first year.

Option I: become less able to perceive sound distinctions not made in their own language. Yes, this rings a bell. Around 6-12 months, babies start to lose the ability to distinguish between sounds that aren't phonologically relevant in their native language. So I think this is a correct change during the latter part of the first year.

Wait, so the question is about language-learning ability changes. The options are about what they begin to do or lose.

So I'm a bit confused between D and I.

The question asks about the change during the latter part of their first year. So for D, it's about uttering first words systematically. I think that's around 12 months. Option I is about perceiving sounds, which I think is a change that happens around this time as well. So both D and I could be correct, but which one is the answer?

The question is about their language-learning ability. So perhaps the ability to perceive sounds is more about the learning aspect. Alternatively, the ability to produce first words is also a change.

Wait, the question says their language-learning ability changes in that they... So it's about how they're learning, not just their production. So maybe I is about their perception affecting learning.

Alternatively, D is about producing words through selective reinforcement, which is a learning mechanism.

Hmm. I think I remember that in the first year, infants start with universal sound perception and then narrow down. So around 6 months, they can distinguish all sounds, but by 12 months, they start losing that ability for non-native sounds. So option I says they become less able to perceive distinctions not in their own language. That must be the correct change.

So the answer would be I.

Wait, but option H says they can perceive sound distinctions in multiple languages. That's the opposite. So H is incorrect, I is correct.

So putting it together, the correct answer is I.

During the latter part of their first year, children undergo significant changes in their language-learning abilities. One key development is the refinement of their sound perception. Initially, infants can distinguish between all sound distinctions in any language, but as they are exposed to their native language, they begin to lose the ability to perceive sound distinctions that are not relevant to their own language. This change reflects a narrowing of their perceptual abilities as they specialize in the sounds of their native language. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. While babbling is systematic, the question focuses on changes in language-learning ability, not random utterances.
- **B**: Incorrect. Forming full sentences occurs much later, around 2-3 years of age.
- **C**: Incorrect. Producing more language than comprehended is not characteristic of this stage.
- **D**: Plausible but less relevant. While children do begin uttering their first words, the question emphasizes changes in language-learning ability, not just production.
- **E**: Incorrect. Children do not lose the ability to understand words; comprehension develops alongside production.
- **F**: Incorrect. Sensitivity to speech rhythms is present earlier and not the key change in the latter part of the first year.
- **G**: Incorrect. Children do not lose the ability to perceive all sound distinctions, only those not relevant to their native language.
- **H**: Incorrect. The ability to perceive sound distinctions in multiple languages diminishes as children specialize in their native language.
- **I**: Correct. This option accurately describes the narrowing of sound perception abilities as children become less able to distinguish sounds not made in their own language.

The correct answer is **I**, as it directly addresses the change in language-learning ability during this period.
