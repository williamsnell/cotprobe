Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about lenses, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says: An object 5 cm in diameter is 33.3 cm from a converging lens of 8 diopters. I need to calculate the position of the image from the lens and its size. The options are A to J, each giving different distances and sizes.

Hmm, I remember that converging lenses are convex lenses. The power of the lens is given in diopters, which I think is the reciprocal of the focal length in meters. So first, I probably need to find the focal length of the lens.

Wait, right. The formula for diopters is D = 1/f, where f is in meters. So if the lens is 8 diopters, that means f = 1/8 meters. Let me convert that to centimeters because the object distance is given in cm. 1/8 meters is 12.5 cm. So the focal length is 12.5 cm.

Next, the object is placed 33.3 cm away from the lens. So the object distance, which I think is denoted as u, is 33.3 cm. Wait, but in the sign conventions, I think for lenses, the object distance is positive when it's on the same side as the incoming light. Since it's a converging lens and the object is in front, u is positive.

I remember the lens formula: 1/f = 1/v + 1/u. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, I think the correct formula is 1/f = 1/u + 1/v, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Oh, no, wait, I think it's 1/f = 1/u + 1/v, but sometimes the signs change based on whether it's a converging or diverging lens. Wait no, the formula is always 1/f = 1/u + 1/v, where f is positive for converging lenses and negative for diverging. Oh wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Wait, no, I think in the standard formula, for a converging lens, f is positive, and for a diverging lens, f is negative. So in this case, f is positive 12.5 cm.

So plugging the values in: 1/12.5 = 1/33.3 + 1/v.

Let me compute 1/12.5 first. 1/12.5 is 0.08. And 1/33.3 is approximately 0.03. So 0.08 = 0.03 + 1/v. Subtract 0.03 from both sides: 0.05 = 1/v. So v is 20 cm. Wait, because 1/0.05 is 20. So v is 20 cm. So the image is formed 20 cm from the lens on the opposite side, since it's a real image formed by a converging lens when the object is beyond the focal point.

Wait, wait, the object is placed at 33.3 cm, which is beyond the focal length of 12.5 cm. So the image should be real, inverted, and smaller. So the image distance is 20 cm.

Now, for the size of the image. The diameter of the object is 5 cm. The magnification m is given by m = v/u. So m = 20 / 33.3. Let me compute that. 20 divided by 33.3 is approximately 0.6. So the magnification is 0.6, which means the image height is 0.6 times the object height.

Wait, but wait. The object is 5 cm in diameter, so the image's diameter would be m multiplied by the object's diameter. So 0.6 * 5 cm = 3 cm. So the image is 3 cm in diameter.

Wait, but let me double-check the magnification formula. I think magnification m is also equal to h_image / h_object. So if the image is inverted, the magnification would be negative. But since the problem only asks for size, the sign doesn't matter here, just the magnitude. So yes, 3 cm is correct.

So the image is at 20 cm from the lens, and 3 cm in size. Looking at the options, option C is 20 cm, 3 cm. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me recompute 1/f = 1/u + 1/v.

f is 12.5 cm, u is 33.3 cm. So 1/12.5 = 0.08. 1/33.3 is approximately 0.03. So 0.08 = 0.03 + 1/v → 1/v = 0.05 → v=20. That seems correct.

Magnification m is v/u = 20/33.3 ≈ 0.6. So 5 cm * 0.6 = 3 cm. Yep, that's right. So the correct option is C: 20 cm, 3 cm.

To solve the problem, we start by determining the focal length of the converging lens. The power of the lens is given as 8 diopters, and since \( D = \frac{1}{f} \), the focal length is:

\[
f = \frac{1}{D} = \frac{1}{8} \, \text{meters} = 12.5 \, \text{cm}.
\]

Next, we use the lens formula:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v},
\]

where \( u = 33.3 \, \text{cm} \) (object distance) and \( f = 12.5 \, \text{cm} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{1}{12.5} = \frac{1}{33.3} + \frac{1}{v}.
\]

Calculating each term:

\[
\frac{1}{12.5} = 0.08, \quad \frac{1}{33.3} \approx 0.03.
\]

Substituting into the equation:

\[
0.08 = 0.03 + \frac{1}{v}.
\]

Solving for \( \frac{1}{v} \):

\[
\frac{1}{v} = 0.05 \quad \Rightarrow \quad v = 20 \, \text{cm}.
\]

Thus, the image is located \( 20 \, \text{cm} \) from the lens on the opposite side.

To find the size of the image, we calculate the magnification \( m \):

\[
m = \frac{v}{u} = \frac{20}{33.3} \approx 0.6.
\]

The magnification is 0.6, meaning the image height is 60% of the object height. Since the object diameter is \( 5 \, \text{cm} \), the image diameter is:

\[
\text{Image diameter} = m \times \text{Object diameter} = 0.6 \times 5 = 3 \, \text{cm}.
\]

Therefore, the image is \( 20 \, \text{cm} \) from the lens and \( 3 \, \text{cm} \) in diameter. Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**C: 20 cm, 3 cm.**
