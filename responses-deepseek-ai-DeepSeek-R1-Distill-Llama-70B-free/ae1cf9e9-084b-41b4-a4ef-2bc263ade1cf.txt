Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

So, a woman is walking due west on the deck of a ship. Her speed is 3 miles per hour. The ship itself is moving north at 22 miles per hour. The question is asking for the speed of the woman relative to the surface of the water.

Hmm, right. I remember that when dealing with relative velocities, I need to consider the vector addition of her velocity relative to the ship and the ship's velocity relative to the water. Because the woman's motion is relative to the ship, but we need her speed relative to the water.

Wait, so velocities add up vectorially. That makes sense because velocity is a vector quantity. So I should break this down into components.

The woman is walking west, and the ship is moving north. Since west and north are perpendicular directions, their velocities don't interfere with each other in terms of direction. So I can model this with a right triangle where one leg is her westward velocity, and the other is the ship's northward velocity.

Let me think about the directions. If the woman walks west, that's the negative x-direction if I consider east as positive x. The ship is moving north, which would be the positive y-direction. So her velocity relative to the ship is 3 mph west, which is -3i in vector terms, but since the ship itself is moving at 22 mph north, which is +22j.

Wait, no. Wait a second. No, the woman's velocity relative to the water is her velocity relative to the ship plus the ship's velocity relative to the water. Because when you're on the ship, you carry the ship's velocity with you. So her velocity relative to the water would be the vector sum of her velocity relative to the ship and the ship's velocity relative to the water.

So mathematically, that would be her velocity (v_woman) = v_woman/ship + v_ship/water.

Since these are vectors, I have to add them component-wise.

Let me assign axes: let's say the x-axis is east-west, and the y-axis is north-south. So east is positive x, north is positive y.

The woman's velocity relative to the ship is west, so that's -3 mph in the x-direction. The ship's velocity is north, so 22 mph in the y-direction.

So the woman's velocity relative to the water is the sum of these two vectors. So her velocity relative to water is (-3, 22) mph.

Wait, no. Wait, no. Because her velocity relative to the ship is -3i, and the ship's velocity is +22j. So when you add them, her overall velocity relative to water is (-3i + 22j) mph.

Now, to find the speed (magnitude of the velocity), I can use the Pythagorean theorem. Because the x and y components are perpendicular, the magnitude is sqrt( (-3)^2 + (22)^2 ).

Calculating that: (-3)^2 is 9, 22 squared is 484. So 9 + 484 is 493. So the magnitude is sqrt(493) mph.

Looking at the options, option G is sqrt(493) mph. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but let me double-check. Are any other options close? Let's see. Option J is sqrt(517), which is higher. Option E is sqrt(485), which is a bit less. So I think I did the calculation right. 3 squared is 9, 22 squared is 484. 9+484=493. So yes, G is correct.

To determine the speed of the woman relative to the surface of the water, we need to account for both her velocity relative to the ship and the ship's velocity relative to the water. Since velocity is a vector quantity, we add the two velocities vectorially.

1. **Assigning components**:  
   - Let the x-axis represent the east-west direction (east is positive x, west is negative x).  
   - Let the y-axis represent the north-south direction (north is positive y).  
   - The woman's velocity relative to the ship is due west at \( 3 \, \mathrm{mi/h} \), so her velocity is \(-3 \, \hat{i} \, \mathrm{mi/h}\).  
   - The ship's velocity relative to the water is due north at \( 22 \, \mathrm{mi/h} \), so its velocity is \( +22 \, \hat{j} \, \mathrm{mi/h} \).

2. **Vector addition**:  
   The woman's velocity relative to the water is the vector sum of her velocity relative to the ship and the ship's velocity relative to the water:  
   \[
   \vec{v}_{\text{woman/water}} = \vec{v}_{\text{woman/ship}} + \vec{v}_{\text{ship/water}} = (-3 \, \hat{i} + 22 \, \hat{j}) \, \mathrm{mi/h}.
   \]

3. **Magnitude of the velocity**:  
   To find the speed (magnitude of the velocity), we use the Pythagorean theorem:  
   \[
   \|\vec{v}_{\text{woman/water}}\| = \sqrt{(-3)^2 + (22)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 484} = \sqrt{493} \, \mathrm{mi/h}.
   \]

4. **Matching with options**:  
   Among the given options, the one that matches \(\sqrt{493} \, \mathrm{mi/h}\) is option **G**.

Thus, the speed of the woman relative to the surface of the water is \(\sqrt{493} \, \mathrm{mi/h}\).
