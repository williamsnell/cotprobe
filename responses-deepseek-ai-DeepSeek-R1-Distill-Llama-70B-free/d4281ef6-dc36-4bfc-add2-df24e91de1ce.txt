Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question says that we're adding 25 ml of 0.11 M sucrose to 10 ml of 0.52 M sucrose. And we need to find the resulting molarity. Hmm, I remember that molarity is moles per liter. So I think this is a dilution problem where we mix two solutions.

Wait, but both are sucrose, so they're the same solute. That should make it easier because I can just add the moles from each solution and then find the total volume.

Right, so the formula I need is something like M1V1 + M2V2 = M_total * V_total. Or wait, no, that's when you're mixing. Oh yeah, because when you mix solutions of the same solute, the total moles are the sum of each solution's moles.

So the first step is to find the moles of sucrose in each solution. Molarity is moles per liter, so for the first solution, it's 0.11 M and 25 ml. Wait, but wait, molarity is per liter, so I need to convert milliliters to liters.

For the first solution: 25 ml is 0.025 liters. So moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.11 mol/L × 0.025 L. Let me calculate that. 0.11 times 0.025 is 0.00275 moles.

Second solution is 10 ml of 0.52 M. So 10 ml is 0.010 liters. Moles = 0.52 × 0.010 = 0.0052 moles.

Now, add the moles together. 0.00275 + 0.0052 = 0.00795 moles total.

Next, find the total volume. 25 ml + 10 ml = 35 ml. Oh wait, but need to convert to liters. 35 ml is 0.035 liters.

Now, the molarity is moles divided by volume in liters. So M = 0.00795 / 0.035. Let me compute that.

0.00795 divided by 0.035. Let me see, 0.035 is 35/1000, which is 0.035. Hmm, 0.00795 divided by 0.035. Let me compute this.

Alternatively, let me multiply numerator and denominator by 1000 to eliminate decimals. So 7.95 divided by 35. Let's see, 35 goes into 7.95. 35 × 0.227 is about 7.95 because 35 × 0.2 is 7, and 35 × 0.027 is 0.945. Adding 7 + 0.945 gives 7.945, which is close to 7.95. So approximately 0.227 M. Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 0.00795 / 0.035:

0.00795 / 0.035 = (7.95e-3) / (3.5e-2) )= 7.95e-3 / 3.5e-2 = (7.95 / 35) ) × 10^(-3 +2) = (0.227) × 10^-1 = 0.0227?

Wait no, wait a minute. Wait, 7.95 divided by 35 is 0.227. Because 35 times 0.227 is 7.945. So 7.95 / 35 = 0.227. But wait, 7.95 /35 is the same as 795 / 3500. Let me compute 795 ÷ 3500.

3500 goes into 795 zero times. 3500 × 0.2 is 700. 795 -700 is 95. Bring down a zero: 950. 3500 goes into 950 0.2 times (since 3500 ×0.2=700). 700 from 950 leaves 250. Bring another zero: 2500. 3500 goes into 2500 0.714 times (since 0.7 ×3500=2450). 2500-2450=50. So so far, it's 0.227... so approximately 0.227 M.

Wait, but wait, the options given are A: 0.33, B:0.45, C:0.40, D:0.28, E:0.12, F:0.26, etc. Hmm, 0.227 is closest to 0.23, which is option I. But wait, let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, wait, 0.00795 divided by 0.035. Let me compute this as decimal division.

0.00795 ÷ 0.035 = ?

Let me write it as 7.95e-3 / 3.5e-2 = (7.95/3.5) × 10^(-3 +2) = (2.271) × 10^-1 = 0.2271 ≈ 0.227 M.

So approximately 0.227 M. Looking at the options, I don't see exactly 0.227. Let me check the options again. The options are:

A: .33 M

B: .45 M

C: .40 M

D: .28 M

E: .12 M

F: .26 M

G: .15 M

H: .19 M

I: .23 M

J: .35 M

So 0.227 is closest to 0.23, which is option I. But wait, I might have made a mistake in the calculations. Let me go through each step again to be sure.

Step 1: Moles in first solution: 0.11 M * 0.025 L = 0.00275 mol.

Yes, because 0.11 * 0.025 is 0.00275.

Step 2: Moles in second solution: 0.52 M * 0.010 L = 0.0052 mol.

That's correct.

Total moles: 0.00275 + 0.0052 = 0.00795 mol. Correct.

Total volume: 25 ml +10 ml=35 ml=0.035 L.

Molarity=0.00795 /0.035 = 0.22714... M.

So approximately 0.227 M. So the closest option is I: 0.23 M.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 0.28, which is higher than 0.23. Hmm, but my calculation says 0.227, which is about 0.23. So the correct answer should be I: 0.23 M.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moles. Let me check again.

First solution: 0.11 M is 0.11 moles per liter. 0.025 L is 25 ml. So 0.11 * 0.025 = 0.00275 moles.

Second solution: 0.52 M and 0.010 L (10 ml). So 0.52 * 0.010 = 0.0052 moles. That adds up to 0.00795 moles.

Total volume is 35 ml, which is 0.035 liters. So 0.00795 / 0.035 = ?

Wait, another approach: 0.00795 /0.035 = (7.95 mg) /35 ml → wait, but it's moles. Alternatively, perhaps using millimoles.

Let me try this using millimoles to avoid decimals.

First solution: 25 ml * 0.11 mmol/ml. Wait, wait, molarity is mmol per ml. Because 1 M = 1000 mmol/L → 1 mmol/ml is 1000 M, which isn't right. Wait, no, wait, 1 M is 1 mole per liter, which is 1000 mmol per liter, so 1 mmol per ml is 1000 M. So 0.11 M is 0.11 mmol per ml. So for 25 ml, it's 25 * 0.11 = 2.75 mmol.

Second solution: 10 ml * 0.52 mmol/ml = 5.2 mmol.

Total mmol: 2.75 +5.2 =7.95 mmol.

Total volume is 35 ml. So molarity is 7.95 mmol /35 ml → convert to M (mmol/ml = M). So 7.95 /35 = 0.227 M, same as before.

So yes, 0.227 M, which is approximately 0.23 M. So the correct answer is option I.

To determine the resulting molarity when 25 mL of 0.11 M sucrose is added to 10 mL of 0.52 M sucrose, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the moles of sucrose in each solution**:  
   - For the first solution:  
     \[
     \text{Moles} = \text{Molarity} \times \text{Volume (in liters)} = 0.11 \, \text{M} \times 0.025 \, \text{L} = 0.00275 \, \text{mol}
     \]
   - For the second solution:  
     \[
     \text{Moles} = \text{Molarity} \times \text{Volume (in liters)} = 0.52 \, \text{M} \times 0.010 \, \text{L} = 0.0052 \, \text{mol}
     \]

2. **Add the moles from both solutions**:  
   \[
   \text{Total moles} = 0.00275 \, \text{mol} + 0.0052 \, \text{mol} = 0.00795 \, \text{mol}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total volume**:  
   \[
   \text{Total volume} = 25 \, \text{mL} + 10 \, \text{mL} = 35 \, \text{mL} = 0.035 \, \text{L}
   \]

4. **Determine the resulting molarity**:  
   \[
   \text{Molarity} = \frac{\text{Total moles}}{\text{Total volume (in liters)}} = \frac{0.00795 \, \text{mol}}{0.035 \, \text{L}} = 0.227 \, \text{M}
   \]

5. **Compare with the given options**:  
   The closest option to \( 0.227 \, \text{M} \) is \( 0.23 \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option **I**.

Thus, the resulting molarity is approximately \( 0.23 \, \text{M} \).
