Okay, so I've got this physics problem about billiard balls colliding. Hmm, I remember that in collisions, especially elastic ones, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. But wait, billiard balls... same mass, right? So that's an important detail.

The problem says a billiard ball with initial velocity u1 hits another that's at rest. After the collision, the first ball moves off at 45 degrees. I need to find their velocities after the collision.

Wait, the options are given as multiple-choice, so I'll probably have to apply the conservation laws and maybe some trigonometry because of the angle.

Let me think. Since it's an elastic collision and the masses are the same, I remember that in a head-on elastic collision with equal masses, the first object stops and the second one moves off with the initial velocity. But wait, this isn't head-on because the first ball is moving at an angle after the collision. So it's an oblique collision.

So I should consider the conservation of momentum in both x and y directions. Let's set up a coordinate system. Suppose before the collision, the first ball is moving along the x-axis with velocity u1. The second ball is at rest.

After the collision, the first ball moves at 45 degrees to the x-axis. Let's call the velocity of the first ball v1, and the second ball v2. Since the collision is elastic, kinetic energy is also conserved.

So, the momentum conservation in the x-direction:

m * u1 = m * v1_x + m * v2_x

Since the masses are the same (m), they cancel out:

u1 = v1_x + v2_x

In the y-direction, initially, there's no momentum because both are at rest in that direction. So:

0 = v1_y + v2_y

Which means v1_y = -v2_y. So the y-components are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Now, for the velocities. The first ball has velocity v1 at 45 degrees. So its components are:

v1_x = v1 * cos(45°) = v1 * (√2/2)
v1_y = v1 * sin(45°) = v1 * (√2/2)

And the second ball's velocity v2 has components v2_x and v2_y, which must satisfy v2_y = -v1_y.

Now, applying the conservation of energy because it's elastic. The initial kinetic energy is (1/2) m u1². After the collision, it's (1/2) m v1² + (1/2) m v2². So:

u1² = v1² + v2².

Hmm, okay. Now, let's write down the equations.

From x-momentum:
u1 = (v1 * √2/2) + v2_x.

From y-momentum:
v1 * (√2/2) = -v2_y.

Wait, but I don't know v2's direction. Maybe I should express v2 in terms of its components. Let me think, perhaps it's easier to consider the magnitude of v2.

Alternatively, maybe I can square the momentum equations to combine them with the energy equation.

Let me try squaring the x-momentum equation:

u1² = [ (√2/2 v1) + v2_x ]²

Which becomes:

u1² = ( (√2/2 v1)^2 ) + 2*(√2/2 v1)*v2_x + v2_x².

Similarly, the y-momentum equation squared is:

(√2/2 v1)^2 = (v2_y)^2.

But since from y-momentum, v2_y = -√2/2 v1, so (v2_y)^2 = ( (√2/2 v1) )^2.

So that's ( (2/4) v1² ) = (v2_y)^2 → (v1²)/2 = v2_y².

Now, the kinetic energy equation:

u1² = v1² + v2².

But v2² is v2_x² + v2_y². So substituting:

u1² = v1² + [v2_x² + (v1²/2)].

Simplify:

u1² = v1² + v2_x² + (v1²/2)

→ u1² = (3/2) v1² + v2_x².

But I have from the x-momentum squared equation:

u1² = ( (√2/2 v1 )^2 ) + 2*(√2/2 v1)*v2_x + v2_x².

Wait, (√2/2 v1)^2 is (2/4) v1² = v1²/2.

So:

u1² = (v1²/2) + 2*(√2/2 v1)*v2_x + v2_x².

But from the energy equation, u1² is also equal to (3/2) v1² + v2_x².

So I can set them equal:

(v1²/2) + 2*(√2/2 v1)*v2_x + v2_x² = (3/2) v1² + v2_x².

Subtract (3/2 v1² + v2_x²) from both sides:

(v1²/2) + 2*(√2/2 v1)*v2_x + v2_x² - (3/2 v1² + v2_x²) = 0.

Simplify terms:

(v1²/2 - 3/2 v1²) + 2*(√2/2 v1 v2_x) + (v2_x² - v2_x²) = 0.

So:

(-v1²) + √2 v1 v2_x = 0.

Hmm, this gives me:

√2 v1 v2_x = v1² → v2_x = v1 / √2.

Wait, but I also have from the x-momentum equation:

u1 = (√2/2 v1) + v2_x.

Substituting v2_x = v1 / √2 into this:

u1 = (√2/2 v1) + (v1 / √2).

Wait, √2/2 is 1/√2. So both terms are (v1/√2). So:

u1 = (v1/√2) + (v1/√2) → u1 = 2*(v1/√2).

Simplify 2/√2 = √2. So:

u1 = v1 * √2 → v1 = u1 / √2.

So v1 is u1 divided by square root of 2.

Then, substitute back into v2_x: v2_x = (u1 / √2) / √2 = u1/(2).

Now, from the y-momentum equation, v2_y = -√2/2 v1 → v1 is u1/√2, so:

v2_y = -(√2/2) * (u1/√2) )= - ( (2^(1/2)) / (2) ) * (u1 / 2^(1/2)) )

Simplify: the √2 in numerator and denominator cancel, leaving:

v2_y = - u1 / 2.

So v2 has components v2_x = u1/2 and v2_y = -u1/2.

Thus, the magnitude of v2 is sqrt( (u1/2)^2 + (u1/2)^2 )= sqrt( u1²/4 + u1²/4 ) = sqrt( u1²/2 )= u1 /√2.

Wait a minute, but that's the same as v1. So both balls have speed u1/√2.

Wait, but the options don't exactly say that. Let me look.

The options are:

Option A: 2u1 → seems too big.

Option B: 3/4 u1 → no.

Option C: 1/√3 u1 → Not sure.

Option D: sqrt(2) u1 → No, since it's u1/√2.

Option E: u1 and 1/√2 u1 → No, because both are 1/√2.

Option F: both 1/2 u1 → No, because that would be smaller than 1/√2.

Option G: 1/√2 u1 → Maybe, but this is for one of them.

Wait, the question asks for the velocities of both balls. So the options need to have two velocities.

Looking at the options, some are for one velocity, others have two.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option E: u1 for first and 1/√2 u1 for second → That can't be, because in our case both are u1/√2.

Option F: both 1/2 u1. No, because 1/2 is less than 1/√2 (approx 0.707).

So wait, perhaps the answer is that each has speed u1/√2. But looking at the options, none of them directly state that except perhaps option G, but that's only one value. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me go back.

Wait, the initial approach considered the components correctly. Let me recheck the steps.

Wait another approach: For elastic collisions with same mass and not head-on, the velocities can be found using the fact that the relative velocity between the two balls is reversed in the line of impact.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, in the case of equal masses, the angle between their velocities after collision should be 90 degrees. Because in elastic collisions with equal masses, the velocity vectors are perpendicular if the collision is not head-on.

Wait, that's an important point. So in our case, the first ball moves at 45 degrees after the collision. So the second ball must move at 45 degrees in the opposite direction, making the angle between them 90 degrees. So each of their velocities would have the same magnitude.

So that would mean both have speed u1 /√2.

So looking back at the options, I don't see an option that directly states both are u1/√2. Wait, option G is 1/√2 u1, but that's just one of them. So perhaps the answer is not among the options given, but that can't be. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check the problem again. The first ball moves off at 45 degrees, but the second ball's direction isn't specified. So perhaps I should double-check the calculations.

Wait, another approach: Let me use the conservation of momentum.

Let me denote the initial momentum as (mu1, 0), since the second ball is at rest.

After collision, first ball has velocity (v1x, v1y) = v1 (cos45, sin45) = (v1√2/2, v1√2/2).

The second ball has velocity (v2x, v2y). 

So the total momentum after collision is:

m(v1√2/2 + v2x, v1√2/2 + v2y) = (mu1, 0).

Dividing both sides by m:

v1√2/2 + v2x = u1 → equation 1

v1√2/2 + v2y = 0 → equation 2

From equation 2: v2y = -v1√2/2.

Now, using the fact that kinetic energy is conserved:

(1/2)m u1² = (1/2)m v1² + (1/2)m v2².

Cancelling m and 1/2:

u1² = v1² + v2².

Now, express v2² as v2x² + v2y².

So:

u1² = v1² + v2x² + (v1√2/2)^2.

Which is:

u1² = v1² + v2x² + (v1² * 2 ) /4 = v1² + v2x² + v1²/2.

So,

u1² = (3/2)v1² + v2x².

From equation 1: v2x = u1 - v1√2/2.

Substituting into the energy equation:

u1² = (3/2) v1² + [u1 - (v1√2/2)]².

Expand the [ ]² term:

= u1² - 2*u1*(v1√2/2) + (v1√2/2)^2.

Simplify each term:

= u1² - (√2 u1 v1) + ( (2 v1²) /4 ) 

= u1² - √2 u1 v1 + (v1² / 2).

So putting it all together:

u1² = (3/2 v1²) + [u1² - √2 u1 v1 + (v1²/2)].

Simplify the right-hand side:

(3/2 v1² + v1²/2 ) + u1² - √2 u1 v1.

3/2 + 1/2 is 2, so:

2 v1² + u1² - √2 u1 v1.

So the equation becomes:

u1² = 2 v1² + u1² - √2 u1 v1.

Subtract u1² from both sides:

0 = 2 v1² - √2 u1 v1.

Factor out v1:

0 = v1 (2 v1 - √2 u1).

So, either v1=0 (which can't be since the first ball is moving) or:

2 v1 = √2 u1 → v1 = (√2 / 2 ) u1 = u1 / √2.

So v1 is u1 divided by √2.

Then, from equation 1:

v2x = u1 - (v1 √2/2 ) → substituting v1:

v2x = u1 - ( (u1/√2) * √2/2 )

Simplify:

The √2 in numerator and denominator cancel, so:

= u1 - (u1 * (1/2)) → u1/2.

And from equation 2, v2y = -v1√2/2 → substituting v1:

= - (u1/√2) * (√2/2 ) → the √2 cancels:

= - u1 / 2.

So the second ball's velocity components are (u1/2, -u1/2).

Thus, the magnitude of each ball's velocity is sqrt( (u1/√2)^2 + (u1/√2)^2 ) ? Wait, no. Wait, v1 is u1/√2, so v1's magnitude is u1/√2. The second ball's magnitude is sqrt( (u1/2)^2 + (u1/2)^2 ) = sqrt( u1²/4 + u1²/4 ) = sqrt( u1²/2 ) = u1/√2. So both have the same speed, u1/√2.

So the velocities are:

First ball: u1/√2 at 45 degrees.

Second ball: u1/√2 at 135 degrees (since its components are positive x and negative y, so 45 degrees below the x-axis in the opposite direction).

But looking at the options, I don't see an option that states both velocities are u1/√2. Let me check the options again.

Looking back:

Option G is 1/√2 u1, but that's only one value.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering only the speed, and maybe one of the options represents that.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing the correct option. Let me re-examine the choices.

The options are:

A: 2 u1 → No.

B: 3/4 u1 → No.

C: 1/√3 u1 → No.

D: sqrt(2) u1 → No.

E: u1 and 1/√2 u1 → No, both are 1/√2.

F: 1/2 u1 each → No.

G: 1/√2 u1 → Maybe, but which ball?

H: u1 → No.

I: 1/2 u1 → No.

J: sqrt(3)/2 u1 → No.

Wait, none of the options seem to correctly describe both velocities as u1/√2. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in my calculations?

Wait, let me check once again.

In the scenario I've considered, both balls end up with the same speed, each moving at 45 degrees relative to the initial direction but in opposite perpendicular directions. So their speeds are both u1/√2.

But the options don't have this as an option. Let me look again.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the options. The question asks for "the velocities of both balls after the collision." So perhaps the correct option is not listed, but that's unlikely. Let me see.

Wait, the initial assumption that the masses are equal is correct. So elastic collision with same mass and non-head-on.

Wait, another thought: Since the collision is elastic and same mass, the first ball's velocity will have a component perpendicular to the initial direction, but perhaps the second ball's velocity is entirely in a new direction.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the first ball's velocity makes 45 degrees with the x-axis, so the second ball's velocity must make some other angle to conserve momentum.

Wait, but in any case, according to the calculations, each ends up with speed u1/√2.

Looking at the options, perhaps option G is the correct one in terms of magnitude, but the options don't have a pair.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the first ball's velocity is u1/2 and the second is also u1/2, making option F correct.

Wait, but that would mean their speeds are each u1/2, which is less than 1/√2 u1 (approx 0.707 vs 0.5). But according to the calculations, that's not the case.

Wait, let me re-calculate the energy conservation:

u1² = v1² + v2².

If both v1 and v2 are u1/√2, then:

v1² + v2² = (u1²/2) + (u1²/2) )= u1². So it works.

If I instead thought both were u1/2, then v1² + v2² would be u1²/4 + u1²/4 = u1²/2, which is less than u1². So that can
