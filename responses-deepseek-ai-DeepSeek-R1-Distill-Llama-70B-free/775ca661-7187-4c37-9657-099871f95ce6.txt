Question:

A national distributor of windows selected a retailer to sell its windows in a specified geographic area. The parties negotiated a written distribution agreement, which stated that any order for windows placed by the retailer would be binding on the distributor "only when expressly accepted by the distributor." For the next two years, the retailer forwarded orders to the distributor, and the distributor always filled the orders. In the third year, the distributor accused the retailer of overcharging customers to install the distributor's windows. The retailer responded that the distributor had no control over the retailer's installation prices. When the distributor received the retailer's next order for windows, it refused to fill the order. If the retailer sues the distributor for breach of contract, will it be likely to prevail?

Options:

A: Yes, because the parties' course of dealing binds the distributor to fill the retailer's order.
B: No, because the agreement gave the distributor the right to expressly accept or reject orders.
C: Yes, because the distributor has always filled the orders in the past, creating an expectation of continued performance.
D: No, because the retailer's practice of overcharging customers excused the distributor's refusal to fill the order.
E: Yes, because the distributor cannot arbitrarily decide not to fill the retailer's orders.
F: Yes, because the distributor's claim regarding overcharging customers is independent of its obligation to fill the retailer's order.
G: No, because the retailer's forwarding of orders to the distributor did not give rise to an obligation on the distributor's part to fill the orders.
H: No, because the distributor has the right to refuse orders at any time according to the agreement.
I: No, because the distributor has the right to reject orders based on the retailer's pricing practices.
J: Yes, because the distributor did not expressly reject the retailer's orders.

Okay, so I've got this question about contract law, specifically dealing with distribution agreements and what happens when one party stops fulfilling orders. Let's try to break it down step by step.

First, the facts. There's a distributor of windows who selects a retailer to sell their products in a specific area. They have a written distribution agreement. The key part of the agreement is that any order from the retailer is only binding on the distributor if the distributor "expressly accepts" it. So, the agreement says that just sending an order doesn't automatically obligate the distributor; they have to explicitly agree to it each time.

Then, for two years, the retailer sends orders, and the distributor fills them every time. Now, in the third year, there's a dispute. The distributor accuses the retailer of overcharging customers for installation. The retailer responds that the distributor doesn't have control over installation prices. Then, when the retailer sends another order, the distributor refuses to fill it. The retailer sues for breach of contract. The question is whether the retailer will prevail.

I need to figure out the legal principles here. It seems like this is about contract formation and the terms of the agreement. The written agreement says that the distributor must expressly accept each order. So, without that acceptance, the order isn't binding. But wait, the parties have a course of dealing where the distributor always filled the orders without explicitly accepting them each time. Could that implied acceptance be enough to form a contract each time?

Under the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code), which applies here because we're dealing with the sale of goods (windows), there's something about firm offers and course of dealing. Also, the concept of "course of performance" can sometimes modify the terms of a written agreement. 

I remember that UCC § 2-207 deals with additional terms in contracts between merchants. But more relevant might be UCC § 2-206, which talks about how an order can be accepted either by a written acceptance or by starting to perform (like filling the order). So if the distributor, upon receiving an order, starts shipping the goods, that could be considered acceptance.

In this case, the written agreement says that orders are only binding when "expressly accepted." But in practice, the distributor filled the orders without sending any written acceptance. So each time the retailer sent an order, the distributor's act of filling it could be seen as an acceptance. That might mean that over time, the parties' conduct modified the original written agreement. 

Wait, but the original agreement's express terms say that the distributor must expressly accept. So if the distributor never sent written acceptances but just filled the orders, perhaps each order became a contract through their actions. So after two years of this, maybe the written term about express acceptance isn't enforceable anymore because their conduct has modified the agreement.

Alternatively, if the distributor's actions of filling the orders consistently could be seen as a waiver of the express acceptance requirement. Waiver can be inferred from conduct, like consistently not enforcing a particular term. So maybe the distributor can't now rely on that term when they've not required it in the past.

But wait, the question is about whether the distributor's refusal to fill the order is a breach. If the original agreement requires express acceptance, then without it, no contract is formed. But if the course of dealing has established that the distributor's performance constitutes acceptance, then each order becomes a contract upon shipment.

In that case, the distributor's refusal to fill the order would be a breach because they had implicitly accepted by their past conduct. So the retailer would have a case.

Looking at the options:

Option A says yes because course of dealing binds the distributor. That seems to align with the idea that their past actions created an obligation.

Option B says no because the agreement gave the right to accept or reject. But if their conduct waived that right, then B might not hold.

Option C talks about expectation of continued performance. That's similar to promissory estoppel, but I'm not sure if that applies here.

Option E says yes because the distributor can't arbitrarily refuse. That might be if there's an implied obligation of good faith, but the written terms might allow refusal unless accepted.

Option H says no because the agreement allows refusal. But if the course of dealing has changed that, H might not be correct.

Wait, the original agreement says that orders are only binding when expressly accepted. So each order is an offer that the distributor can accept or reject. But if the distributor, over time, always accepted by filling the orders, maybe that creates a binding obligation to continue accepting, or at least modifies the terms so that the distributor's performance is a form of acceptance.

Alternatively, under UCC § 2-207, additional terms become part of the contract if they are not objected to. But I'm not sure that's directly applicable here.

Another angle: the written agreement is clear that express acceptance is needed. So without it, there's no contract. But the distributor's past actions of filling orders without express acceptance could be seen as a course of dealing that modifies the agreement. So under UCC § 2-202, which allows for the terms of a written agreement to be supplemented or modified by course of performance or dealing.

So the initial term required express acceptance, but the course of dealing (distributor always filling the orders) could have modified that term, so that the distributor's act of filling became the acceptance. So each order, once filled, was a contract, but the initial agreement might have been modified so that the distributor's performance is acceptance.

If that's the case, then the distributor's refusal to fill the order would be a breach because, under the modified terms, the order was binding upon the distributor's shipment.

So looking at the options again:

Option A says yes because course of dealing binds the distributor. That seems correct if the course of dealing modified the agreement.

Option H says no because the agreement gives the right to refuse. But if the agreement was modified by course of dealing, H would be incorrect.

Option B says no because the agreement gave the right to accept or reject. But if the course of dealing changed that, B is wrong.

So I'm leaning towards A being correct. But wait, let's think about the UCC again. Under UCC § 2-206(1)(b), an order can be accepted by either a prompt written acceptance or by starting to perform. So in this case, the distributor's act of filling the order each time could be considered an acceptance, even without written confirmation.

So each order becomes a contract upon the distributor shipping. Therefore, the written agreement's express acceptance clause might have been superseded by the parties' conduct. Therefore, the distributor's refusal to fill the order would be a breach because they had implicitly accepted by their past actions.

So the correct answer would be A: Yes, because the course of dealing binds the distributor.

Wait, but another thought: the original agreement says that the distributor's express acceptance is needed. So each order is an offer, and the distributor can accept or reject. But if the distributor never sends an acceptance but just ships the goods, under UCC 2-206, that's acceptance by performance. So each time, the retailer's order plus the distributor's shipment creates a contract. So the two years of this practice establish that the distributor's performance is a form of acceptance.

Therefore, when the distributor refused the next order, they breached the contract because they had effectively accepted by their past actions, creating an expectation that they would continue to accept in the same way.

So the retailer would likely prevail because the course of dealing (their conduct) established that the distributor's performance was acceptance. Therefore, the correct answer is A.

The question revolves around a written distribution agreement between a window distributor and a retailer, which states that orders are binding on the distributor "only when expressly accepted." However, over two years, the distributor consistently filled the retailer's orders without providing written acceptance. In the third year, the distributor refused to fill an order, claiming the retailer overcharged customers. The issue is whether the retailer can prevail in a breach of contract claim.

Key legal principles include the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), specifically UCC § 2-206, which allows acceptance of an offer by performance (e.g., shipping goods). The written agreement requires express acceptance, but the distributor's consistent practice of filling orders without written acceptance could constitute implied acceptance through conduct. This course of dealing may have modified the original agreement, creating an obligation for the distributor to accept orders through performance.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Correct. The course of dealing (the distributor filling orders without express acceptance) binds the distributor, as it modified the original agreement. This aligns with UCC § 2-206 and the concept of acceptance by performance.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. While the agreement initially allowed the distributor to accept or reject orders, the course of dealing likely waived this right by consistently filling orders without express acceptance.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The expectation of continued performance is not the primary issue; the focus is on whether the course of dealing modified the agreement.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The distributor's refusal was not arbitrary but based on the written agreement's terms, which may no longer apply due to the modified terms via course of dealing.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The agreement's express acceptance clause may no longer be enforceable due to the course of dealing, which modified the terms.

The retailer is likely to prevail because the distributor's actions created a binding obligation to accept orders through performance, modifying the original agreement. 

**Answer: A**
