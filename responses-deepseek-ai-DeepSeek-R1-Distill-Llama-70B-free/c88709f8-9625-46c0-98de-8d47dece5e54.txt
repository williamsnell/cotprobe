Question:

A highway patrol officer stopped a driver for speeding and found that her license was suspended. He arrested her for driving while under suspension and secured her in the rear seat of the squad car. He then searched the car where he found several bags of cocaine inside a coat that was setting on the rear seat; he arrested her for possession and possession with intent to deliver cocaine. Prior to trial, the driver moved for suppression of the cocaine. Is it likely that the trial court will grant the suppression motion?

Options:

A: Yes, it must be suppressed because this was an unreasonable, warrantless search.
B: No, the motion will be denied because the initial traffic stop was legal and everything that flowed therefrom was a reasonable step to search for crime.
C: No, the motion will be denied because the search was permissible as incident to a proper arrest.
D: Yes, the motion will be granted because a search of a vehicle requires a search warrant unless there are exceptional exigent circumstances.
E: Yes, the motion will be granted because the officer did not have probable cause to search the car.
F: No, the motion will be denied because the officer had the right to search the car for his own safety.
G: No, the motion will be denied because the officer had probable cause to search the car due to the driver's suspended license.
H: Yes, the motion will be granted because the officer did not see the cocaine in plain view before searching the car.
I: Yes, the motion will be granted because the officer did not have the driver's consent to search the car.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about whether a search of a car will be suppressed. Let me break it down step by step.

So the scenario is: A highway patrol officer stops a driver for speeding. Then he finds her license is suspended, so he arrests her for driving under suspension. He puts her in the rear seat of the squad car. Then he searches the car and finds cocaine in a coat on the rear seat. She moves to suppress the cocaine evidence.

The question is whether the court will grant the suppression motion. The options are A through I.

First, I need to think about the legal principles involved here. The key issue is whether the search of the car was legal. Searches and seizures are governed by the Fourth Amendment, which requires probable cause and usually a warrant, but there are exceptions.

When someone is arrested, the police can conduct a search incident to arrest. That's one exception. But I remember that when the arrest happens inside a car, the police can search the entire passenger compartment, including any containers that might hold a weapon. That's from the case of New York v. Belton. But wait, I think that applies when the person is arrested and still in the car. In this case, the woman was moved to the squad car's rear seat. So she's no longer in the car being searched. Hmm, does that matter?

Also, another exception is the "plain view" doctrine. If an officer is lawfully present and sees evidence in plain view, they can seize it without a warrant. But in this case, the officer had to search the coat to find the cocaine, so maybe it wasn't in plain view. So that might not apply.

Wait, the officer put her in the squad car, then searched her own car. So the car isn't in her possession anymore. So perhaps the search incident to arrest doesn't apply because she's no longer near the car. Or maybe the car is under the officer's control, so it's a different situation.

Alternatively, there's the concept of "exigent circumstances." If the police have a valid reason to search without a warrant, like evidence being destroyed, but I'm not sure if that applies here.

Another thought: When the driver is arrested and taken out of the car, the police can search the car without a warrant under certain conditions. Oh, right! There's the case of Chambers v. Maroney, where the Supreme Court held that when a suspect is arrested and the car is in police custody, the police can search the entire car, including the trunk, without a warrant because the car can be easily moved and there's a need to preserve evidence.

Wait, but in this case, the car is already stopped and under the officer's control. So maybe the search is permissible under the vehicle exception, which says that a warrantless search of a vehicle is allowed if there's probable cause. So if the officer had probable cause to believe there was evidence of a crime in the car, he could search it without a warrant.

But when did the officer have probable cause? He stopped her for speeding, then found her license was suspended, leading to her arrest. At that point, he knew about the suspended license, but what about the cocaine? Did he have any reason to believe there was cocaine in the car before searching? Or was the search more of a general exploratory search?

Wait, maybe the search was incident to arrest. When she was arrested, he could search her and the area within her reach. But she's in the squad car, so perhaps the car she was driving is now outside her reach. So the search incident to arrest might not cover the entire car once she's in custody elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe the officer had probable cause to search the car because she was driving with a suspended license, but that alone doesn't give probable cause for drugs, I think. Unless there were other factors, like the smell of drugs or something else, which the question doesn't mention. So without more, the officer's probable cause for the search might be lacking.

Wait, but when the officer arrested her, he could have conducted an inventory search of the car if it's impounded. But the question doesn't mention impoundment, just that he searched the car after arresting her. So maybe that's a different exception.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline the possible exceptions that apply here:

1. Search incident to arrest: This usually allows a search of the person and the area within their immediate control. But since she's in the squad car, her own car's passenger compartment might not be within her reach, so maybe this exception doesn't apply.

2. Exigent circumstances: If the car is in the officer's custody, perhaps there's a fear that evidence could be destroyed, but I'm not sure if that's the case here without more facts.

3. Probable cause with the vehicle exception: If the officer had probable cause to believe there was evidence in the car, he could search without a warrant. But did he have probable cause before searching? The driver's suspended license might not be enough, unless there's more.

Wait, the question doesn't say the officer had any reason to suspect drugs before searching. He found the cocaine only after searching. So maybe he didn't have probable cause to search the car in the first place.

Alternatively, maybe the plain view doctrine applies if the cocaine was in plain view when he searched, but the question says he found it inside a coat on the rear seat. So it wasn't in plain view; he had to search the coat.

So if the officer didn't have probable cause and no warrant, and the search wasn't incident to arrest because she's in custody elsewhere, then the search might be unreasonable.

Wait, but another angle: Once the driver is under arrest and in custody, the police can conduct an inventory search of the vehicle if it's impounded. But the question doesn't say the car was impounded, just that he searched it. So maybe that's not applicable here.

Alternatively, when the officer arrests her for driving under suspension, he might have a right to search the car for any items related to that offense or officer safety. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the officer had already arrested her and secured her in the squad car. Then he went back to search her car. At that point, she's not a threat, so maybe there's no safety concern. But if he's searching for evidence related to the crime, he needs probable cause.

But the crime here was driving under suspension. The cocaine is a separate offense. So he couldn't have had probable cause for the cocaine before searching, unless there was something else.

So, putting it all together, the officer searched the car after arresting her, and found the cocaine. But without a warrant, the question is whether the search was legal.

If the search was without a warrant and not covered by any exception, then the evidence would be suppressed.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Yes, must suppress as unreasonable warrantless search. That would be the case if no exception applies.

Option C: No, because search incident to arrest. But if she's not in the car, maybe that doesn't apply.

Option E: Yes, because no probable cause. If the officer didn't have PC to search, then this would apply.

Option H: Yes, because not in plain view. Since the cocaine was in a coat, plain view doesn't apply.

So, probably the suppression should be granted because the officer didn't have probable cause or an exception to warrantless search.

Wait, but wait! There's another aspect: the officer had lawfully arrested her and taken her into custody. Once a car is in police custody, maybe the search is permissible under the vehicle exception, but that requires probable cause. Without probable cause, it's not allowed.

So if the officer had no reason to believe there were drugs in the car before searching, then the search without a warrant would be illegal.

So in that case, options A, E, H, I could be possible.

Option E says the officer didn't have probable cause to search the car. That seems likely because the offense was driving under suspension, not drug-related.

So the answer would be E: Yes, the motion will be granted because the officer did not have probable cause to search the car.

Alternatively, option A says it's an unreasonable warrantless search, which could also be correct if no exception applies.

Wait, the vehicle exception allows warrantless searches if there's probable cause. So if the officer had probable cause, it's allowed. But without it, it's not. So in this case, without PC, it's an unreasonable search.

So option E would make sense.

Alternatively, option D says a search of a vehicle requires a warrant unless exigent circumstances. But that's not entirely accurate because the vehicle exception allows warrantless searches with probable cause.

So, the correct reasoning is that the officer lacked probable cause to search the car, so the search was unlawful, and the evidence should be suppressed.

Therefore, the answer is E.
</think>

The question revolves around whether the search of the car was legal under the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. The officer stopped the driver for speeding, discovered her license was suspended, arrested her, and then searched the car, finding cocaine in a coat on the rear seat. The key issue is whether the search was lawful, as it was conducted without a warrant.

### Key Legal Principles:
1. **Search Incident to Arrest**: Allows police to search the person and areas within their immediate control at the time of arrest. However, since the driver was secured in the squad car, the car she was driving was no longer within her reach, making this exception likely inapplicable.
   
2. **Plain View Doctrine**: Requires the evidence to be visibly apparent to the officer without the need for further search. Here, the cocaine was inside a coat, so it was not in plain view.

3. **Vehicle Exception**: Permits warrantless searches of vehicles if the officer has probable cause to believe evidence of a crime is present. However, the officer had no apparent reason to suspect drugs before searching, as the arrest was for driving under suspension.

4. **Exigent Circumstances**: Not applicable here, as there was no immediate emergency or risk of evidence destruction.

5. **Probable Cause**: The officer lacked probable cause to search the car for drugs, as the arrest was for a suspended license, which does not inherently suggest the presence of illegal substances.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A**: Incorrect. While the search was warrantless, the vehicle exception could apply if probable cause existed. Here, it did not.
- **B**: Incorrect. The traffic stop was legal, but the search of the car was not a reasonable step without probable cause.
- **C**: Incorrect. A search incident to arrest does not apply because the driver was no longer in the car.
- **D**: Incorrect. The vehicle exception allows warrantless searches with probable cause, which was absent here.
- **E**: Correct. The officer lacked probable cause to search the car, making the search unlawful.
- **F**: Incorrect. There was no safety concern justifying the search after the driver was secured.
- **G**: Incorrect. A suspended license does not provide probable cause for a drug search.
- **H**: Incorrect. While the cocaine was not in plain view, the primary issue is the lack of probable cause.
- **I**: Incorrect. The lack of consent is not the central issue; the search was unlawful due to lack of probable cause.

### Conclusion:
The search was unlawful because the officer lacked probable cause to search the car. The motion to suppress the evidence is likely to be granted.
