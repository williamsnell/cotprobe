Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here about the Gibbs energy difference between a real gas and a perfect gas under the same conditions. Hmm, I remember from my notes that the fugacity comes into play when dealing with real gases. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question gives me the fugacity coefficient, which is 0.72, at a certain temperature and pressure. I need to find the difference in molar Gibbs energy between the real gas and the perfect gas in the same state.

Wait, I think the formula for the Gibbs energy change involves the fugacity. Oh right, the equation is something like ΔG = RT ln(φ), where φ is the fugacity coefficient. Because for an ideal gas, the fugacity is just the pressure, but for a real gas, it's φ times the pressure. So when you calculate the Gibbs energy, it's relative to the ideal state.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. The Gibbs energy difference between the real gas and the ideal gas at the same temperature and pressure is given by ΔG = RT ln(φ), right? Because for an ideal gas, φ is 1, so the change would be zero, which makes sense.

So in this problem, the temperature is 200 K. Oh wait, the question says that data refers to 298.15 K unless otherwise stated. So does that mean the temperature here is 200 K, which is explicitly given, so we use that. So T is 200 K.

The fugacity coefficient φ is 0.72. So plugging into the formula, ΔG = RT ln(φ).

Wait, but wait a second. Oh, no! Wait, no, because the formula is ΔG = RT ln(φ), but I'm a bit confused about the sign. Let me think again. The change in Gibbs energy when going from the ideal to the real state. So for a real gas, the fugacity is lower than the pressure if φ < 1. So the Gibbs energy is lower than the ideal case because the real gas is at a lower effective pressure. Or wait, no, I'm getting a bit mixed up here.

Wait, no, the formula is ΔG = nRT ln(φ), but wait, wait—no, no. Wait, no, because the change in Gibbs energy is for one mole, so it's just RT ln(φ). Because for a real gas, the chemical potential μ is given by μ = μ° + RT ln φ. And for an ideal gas, μ_real would be μ_ideal (where φ=1), so the difference is RT ln φ.

So in this case, φ is 0.72, which is less than 1. So ln(0.72) will be negative. So ΔG is negative.

Let me compute that. So R is the gas constant, which is 8.314 J/mol·K. T is 200 K. So plugging in:

ΔG = (8.314 J/mol·K) * 200 K * ln(0.72)

First, compute ln(0.72). Let me think. ln(0.7) is about -0.35667, and ln(0.72) is a bit higher. Let me calculate it more accurately. Alternatively, I can use a calculator approach.

Wait, 0.72 is e^x. Let me approximate. Let's see:

We know that ln(0.75) is about -0.28768, and ln(0.7) is about -0.35667. Since 0.72 is between 0.7 and 0.75, the ln should be between -0.35667 and -0.28768. Let me calculate ln(0.72) more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator here. Oh wait, I can't, but I can remember that ln(0.72) is approximately -0.3285.

Wait, let me check that. Let me think of e^(-0.3285). e^(-0.3) is about 0.7408. e^(-0.3285) is about 0.72. So yes, ln(0.72) ≈ -0.3285.

So now, compute ΔG:

ΔG = 8.314 * 200 * (-0.3285)

Let's compute that step by step.

First, 8.314 * 200 = 1662.8 J/mol.

Then, 1662.8 * (-0.3285) ≈ Let me compute this:

0.3285 is approximately 0.33.

1662.8 * 0.33 ≈ 1662.8 * 0.3 = 498.84, and 1662.8 * 0.03 = 49.884. So total 548.724. But since it's negative, it's -548.724 J/mol.

Wait, wait. Let me do it more accurately.

0.3285 * 1662.8:

Compute 1662.8 * 0.3 = 498.84.

1662.8 * 0.02 = 33.256.

1662.8 * 0.0085 = let's see, 1662.8 * 0.008 = 13.3024, and 1662.8 * 0.0005 = 0.8314. So 13.3024 + 0.8314 = 14.1338.

Now add them up: 0.3 is 498.84, 0.02 is 33.256, 0.0085 is 14.1338. So total is 498.84 + 33.256 = 532.096 + 14.1338 = 546.2298.

But since the original was 0.3285, which is 0.3 + 0.02 + 0.0085, so the total is 546.2298 J, but with a negative sign, so -546.2298 J/mol.

Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, 1662.8 multiplied by 0.3285 is that. But since it's 200 * 8.314, which is 1662.8 J, but with the ln term being negative, so the product is negative.

So ΔG is approximately -546 J/mol.

Wait, but let me check the exact value.

Alternatively, let me compute 8.314 * 200 = 1662.8 J/mol.

Now multiply by ln(0.72) ≈ -0.3285.

1662.8 * (-0.3285) = -1662.8 * 0.3285.

Compute 1662.8 * 0.3285:

Compute 1662.8 * 0.3 = 498.84.

1662.8 * 0.02 = 33.256.

1662.8 * 0.0085 = 14.1338.

Adding up: 498.84 + 33.256 = 532.096; 532.096 +14.1338≈546.2298.

So 1662.8 * 0.3285 ≈ 546.23 J. So with the negative, it's -546.23 J/mol.

Convert that into kJ: -0.54623 kJ/mol.

Looking at the options, I see option I is -0.75, option E is -0.85, option C is -0.55, G is -0.65, etc.

Wait, but wait! Did I make a mistake? Let me double-check the formula. Oh wait, the formula is ΔG = RT ln φ, yes. So for φ=0.72, ln(0.72)≈-0.3285.

So calculation seems correct. So the Gibbs energy difference is approximately -0.546 kJ/mol.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C: -0.55 kJ/mol. But wait, let's check the options again.

The options are:

A: -0.95kJ/mol
B: -0.35
C: -0.55
D: -0.25
E: -0.85
F: -0.45
G: -0.65
H: -0.05
I: -0.75
J: -0.15

So my calculation is about -0.546, which is approximately -0.55, so option C.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me think again. Did I miss a factor? Because sometimes, the formula might have a negative sign, but I think I accounted for that because φ is less than 1, so ln φ is negative, so ΔG is negative.

Alternatively, perhaps I forgot to consider the ideal gas value. Wait, no, the formula is correct.

Wait another thought: Sometimes, the Gibbs energy of the real gas is lower than that of the ideal gas because real gases tend to have lower fugacity. So yes, the value is negative, which aligns with my calculation.

So the correct answer should be option C, which is -0.55 kJ/mol.

But wait, looking at the options, option I is -0.75, which is more negative than my result. Hmm. Did I miscalculate ln(0.72)?

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the ln value. Let me recalculate ln(0.72) more accurately.

Using a calculator approach:

We know that ln(0.7) ≈ -0.35667, ln(0.71)= ?

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute ln(0.72) using the Taylor series or an approximate method.

Wait, but I can try to compute it more accurately. Let me think:

We can write ln(0.72) as ln(72/100) = ln(18/25) = ln(18) - ln(25).

But that might not help. Alternatively, perhaps using the expansion around a point.

Alternatively, perhaps I can remember that ln(0.72) is approximately -0.3285, as I thought earlier. Let me check with a calculator. Wait, I can't do that, but perhaps I can compute it using another approach.

Let me compute e^(-0.3285) and see if it's close to 0.72.

e^(-0.3285) = 1 / e^(0.3285).

Compute e^0.3285. Let's see:

e^0.3 ≈ 1.34986.

e^0.3285 is a bit higher. Let's compute 0.3285.

We can compute e^0.3285 ≈ 1 + 0.3285 + (0.3285)^2/2 + (0.3285)^3/6 + (0.3285)^4/24.

Let me compute each term:

Term 1: 1.

Term 2: 0.3285.

Term 3: (0.3285)^2 / 2 ≈ (0.1080) / 2 ≈ 0.0540.

Term4: (0.3285)^3 /6 ≈ (0.0355) /6 ≈ 0.00592.

Term5: (0.3285)^4 /24 ≈ (0.0117)/24 ≈ 0.000487.

Adding terms up to term5:

1 + 0.3285 = 1.3285.

+0.0540 → 1.3825.

+0.00592 → 1.3884.

+0.000487 → 1.3889.

So e^0.3285 ≈ 1.3889.

So e^(-0.3285) ≈ 1/1.3889 ≈ 0.72. So that's correct. Thus, ln(0.72) ≈ -0.3285.

So the calculation is correct. So ΔG is about -546 J, which is -0.546 kJ. So the closest option is C: -0.55 kJ/mol.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure about the formula. The question says the difference from a perfect gas in the same state. So for a perfect gas at the same T and P, the Gibbs energy is higher? Because for real gases, the fugacity is lower, so the Gibbs energy is lower, which would mean the difference is negative, which is what I have.

So yes, I think the correct answer is option C, -0.55 kJ/mol. But looking at the options, option G is -0.65, which is a bit further. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

Compute 8.314 * 200 = 1662.8 J/mol.

Multiply by (-0.3285):

1662.8 * (-0.3285) = ?

Compute 1662.8 * 0.3 = 498.84.

1662.8 * 0.02 = 33.256.

1662.8 * 0.0085 = 14.1338.

So sum: 498.84 + 33.256 = 532.096.

532.096 +14.1338 = 546.2298.

So 1662.8 * 0.3285 ≈ 546.2298 J.

So with the negative, it's -546.23 J, which is -0.54623 kJ/mol.

So that's approximately -0.546 kJ/mol, which is about -0.55. So option C is -0.55, which matches.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C.
</think>

To calculate the difference in molar Gibbs energy between a real gas and a perfect gas in the same state, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta G = RT \ln(\phi)
\]

where:
- \( R = 8.314 \, \mathrm{J/mol \cdot K} \) (universal gas constant),
- \( T = 200 \, \mathrm{K} \) (given temperature),
- \( \phi = 0.72 \) (fugacity coefficient).

### Step 1: Compute \( \ln(\phi) \)
The fugacity coefficient \( \phi = 0.72 \). Using approximations or a calculator, \( \ln(0.72) \approx -0.3285 \).

### Step 2: Calculate \( \Delta G \)
Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
\Delta G = (8.314 \, \mathrm{J/mol \cdot K})(200 \, \mathrm{K})(-0.3285)
\]

First, calculate \( 8.314 \times 200 = 1662.8 \, \mathrm{J/mol} \). Then multiply by \( -0.3285 \):

\[
\Delta G = 1662.8 \times (-0.3285) \approx -546.23 \, \mathrm{J/mol}
\]

Convert to kilojoules:

\[
\Delta G \approx -0.546 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}
\]

### Step 3: Match the closest option
The calculated value \( \Delta G \approx -0.546 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol} \) is closest to option **C: -0.55 kJ/mol**.

### Final Answer:
**C**
