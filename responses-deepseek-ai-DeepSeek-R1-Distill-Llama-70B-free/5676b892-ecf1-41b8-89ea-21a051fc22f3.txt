Question:

An avid baseball fan learned that a local professional baseball club was conducting a baseball camp for fans who wanted to meet and receive instruction from the club's players. The cost of the two-week camp was advertised for $2,500, which included meals and housing. The fan, a 54-year-old salesman, forwarded the club a $50 registration deposit, which reserved him a spot in the baseball camp. Thereafter, the fan received a contract from the club, which all baseball camp attendees were required to sign. The agreement provided that the $2,500 entrance fee was nonrefundable. According to the agreement, all attendees would receive group instruction during the baseball camp. Consequently, the club's operating costs would not be reduced if one or more of the attendees failed to participate or complete the two-week program. The fan signed the contract and forwarded it with his $2,500 entrance fee to the club. Two days before the start of the baseball camp, however, the fan died from a heart attack. In a restitutionary action, can the executor of the fan's estate, a surviving brother, recover on behalf of the estate either all or part of the $2,500 paid to the club?

Options:

A: Yes, because the club did not incur any cost related to the fan's participation.
B: Yes, under the doctrine of frustration of purpose.
C: No, because the club had already invested in resources for the camp.
D: No, because the fan knew the risks when he signed the contract.
E: No, because the fan's death was not the club's responsibility.
F: No, because under the terms of the agreement the $2,500 entrance fee was nonrefundable.
G: No, but only if the club can show that before the start of the baseball camp it rejected another applicant because of its commitment to the fan.
H: Yes, if the club can fill the spot with another attendee.
I: Yes, because the club would otherwise be unjustly enriched at the fan's expense.
J: Yes, because the fan didn't receive the service he paid for.

Okay, so I've got this question about contract law and restitution. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The scenario is about a baseball fan who signs up for a camp. The camp costs $2,500, which includes meals and housing. The fan sends a $50 deposit to reserve his spot and later signs a contract that says the $2,500 is non-refundable. The contract mentions that all attendees get group instruction, and the club's costs wouldn't be reduced if someone doesn't participate. Then, two days before the camp starts, the fan dies. The question is whether the executor of his estate can recover the $2,500 in a restitution action.

Hmm, so I'm thinking about the legal principles here. The key points are that the contract says the fee is non-refundable, and that the club's costs don't decrease if someone doesn't show up. 

I remember that in contract law, when a party breaches a contract or when a contract is terminated, the non-breaching party can sometimes recover damages. But here, the fan died, which isn't a breachâ€”it's more of an impossibility or frustration. Wait, but the contract was already signed, so maybe it's about whether the estate can get the money back despite the non-refundable clause.

I think about restitution. Restitution is about unjust enrichment. So if the club keeps the money but doesn't provide the service, they might be unjustly enriched. But the contract says non-refundable. So does that clause hold up?

Another angle is whether the club can mitigate their losses. If they can fill the spot with another attendee, then their loss is minimal, and keeping the money might be unjust. But if they can't, maybe they can keep it.

Looking at the options:

Option A says yes because the club didn't incur costs. But wait, the contract says the club's costs wouldn't be reduced, so they might have already spent money regardless. So if the fan dies, the club's costs are the same. So maybe the club is still entitled to keep the money because they didn't save anything by him not attending.

Option B is about frustration of purpose. Frustration occurs when the main purpose of the contract is frustrated. Here, the purpose was for the fan to attend the camp. His death frustrated that purpose. But does that apply here? Frustration usually allows both parties to be excused from performance. So maybe the estate can get the money back. But I'm not sure if this applies because the contract had a non-refundable clause.

Option C says no because the club invested resources. But the contract says their costs aren't reduced, so maybe they don't need to refund because they've already spent the money on the camp.

Option D says no because the fan knew the risks. That seems more about assumption of risk, but the contract was non-refundable, so maybe he agreed to that.

Option E says no because it's not the club's responsibility. That's probably about causation, but the death isn't their fault. But that doesn't directly address the refund.

Option F says no because the agreement was non-refundable. That's straightforward. The contract terms say it's non-refundable, so the estate can't recover.

Option G says no unless the club can show they turned away others. So if they had a waiting list and took someone else, then maybe they don't need to refund. But the question doesn't say anything about that, so maybe G isn't the right choice.

Option H says yes if they can fill the spot. But the question doesn't mention whether they did or not. So maybe this is a possible scenario, but the answer might not depend on that.

Option I says yes because the club would be unjustly enriched. If the fan didn't receive the service, keeping the money would be unfair. But the contract says it's non-refundable, so maybe the club is allowed to keep it.

Option J says yes because the service wasn't received. But again, the contract might override that.

So putting it together: The contract has a non-refundable clause. The club's costs aren't reduced whether the fan attends or not. So they might not be unjustly enriched because they had to provide the camp regardless. So the estate might not be able to recover because the contract is clear.

Wait, but if the fan paid and didn't get the service, does the non-refundable clause stand? I think in some cases, such clauses are enforceable, especially if the services were ready but the attendee couldn't make it. But if the attendee dies, maybe it's different. But the contract doesn't make exceptions for death, I suppose.

So the correct answer would probably be F: No, because the agreement was non-refundable. But wait, another thought: Some courts might look at whether the club can mitigate by filling the spot. If they can, then keeping the money would be unjust. But the question says the camp's costs wouldn't be reduced, implying that the club's costs were fixed regardless of attendance. So they might not need to refund.

Alternatively, maybe the non-refundable fee is considered liquidated damages. But if the amount is reasonable, it's enforceable. If it's a penalty, it's not. But the question doesn't say it's a penalty, so it's probably okay.

So I'm leaning towards F as the correct answer. The contract clearly states it's non-refundable, so the estate can't recover.

The question revolves around whether the executor of the fan's estate can recover the $2,500 paid to the baseball club after the fan's death, given that the contract explicitly states the fee is non-refundable. The key legal principles at play include the enforceability of non-refundable clauses, unjust enrichment, and the doctrine of frustration of purpose.

The contract clearly states that the $2,500 entrance fee is non-refundable, and it specifies that the club's operating costs would not be reduced if an attendee fails to participate. This suggests that the club's expenses were fixed and incurred regardless of the fan's attendance. While the fan's death prevents him from receiving the service, the contract's terms do not provide for refunds in such circumstances. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The club's costs are not reduced by the fan's absence, so the non-refundable clause likely applies.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Frustration of purpose could apply if the contract's main purpose is thwarted, but the contract's non-refundable clause likely overrides this.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The club's investment in resources does not directly impact the refundability of the fee.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The fan's awareness of risks does not negate the estate's right to restitution.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The club's lack of responsibility for the fan's death does not resolve the refund issue.
- **Option F**: Correct. The contract explicitly states the fee is non-refundable, and the club's costs are not reduced by the fan's absence.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The question does not provide evidence that the club rejected other applicants, making this irrelevant.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The question does not specify whether the club filled the spot, and the refundability is governed by the contract, not this factor.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. While the club might appear unjustly enriched, the contract's terms likely prevent restitution.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The fan's failure to receive the service does not override the contract's non-refundable clause.

The correct answer is **F**, as the contract's non-refundable clause is enforceable, and the club's costs are not reduced by the fan's absence. 

Answer: F
