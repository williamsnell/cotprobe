Okay, so I've got this DNA ratio problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: The [(A + G)/(T + C)] ratio in one strand of duplex DNA is 0.3. Then there are three parts: (a) what's the ratio in the complementary strand, (b) what's the ratio for the entire molecule, and (c) if the [(A + T)/(C + G)] ratio is 0.3, what's that ratio in the complementary strand and the entire molecule.

Wait, the question has parts a, b, c. But the options are labeled A to J, each with three numbers. So I think each option is a triplet for (a, b, c) respectively.

I remember that in DNA, the two strands are complementary. So the base pairs are A-T and C-G. So for any strand, the number of A's equals the number of T's in the complementary strand, and same with G and C.

Let me tackle part (a) first. The given ratio in one strand is (A + G)/(T + C) = 0.3.

Hmm. Let's call the given strand as Strand 1. So for Strand 1, (A1 + G1)/(T1 + C1) = 0.3.

But in the complementary strand, Strand 2, the A's become T's and vice versa, and G's become C's and vice versa. So in Strand 2, the A's would be equal to T1, the T's would be A1, G's would be C1, and C's would be G1.

Wait, let me think. Strand 1 has A, T, C, G. Strand 2, being complementary, has T, A, G, C. No, wait, that's not quite right. Wait, each base in Strand 1 pairs with the complementary base in Strand 2. So Strand 1: A pairs with T in Strand 2. Similarly, T in Strand 1 pairs with A in Strand 2, C pairs with G, G pairs with C.

Wait, that might not be the right way to think about it. Let's consider the counts.

In Strand 1, the count of A is A1, T is T1, C is C1, G is G1.

In Strand 2, the count of A would be equal to the number of T in Strand 1, because each T in Strand 1 pairs with an A in Strand 2. Similarly, the number of T in Strand 2 is equal to the A in Strand 1. Same for C and G: C in Strand 2 equals G in Strand 1, and G in Strand 2 equals C in Strand 1.

So, for Strand 2: A2 = T1, T2 = A1, C2 = G1, G2 = C1.

So the ratio in Strand 2 is (A2 + G2) / (T2 + C2) = (T1 + C1) / (A1 + G1).

Wait, because A2 is T1, G2 is C1. So A2 + G2 = T1 + C1.

T2 is A1, C2 is G1. So T2 + C2 = A1 + G1.

So the ratio for Strand 2 is (T1 + C1)/(A1 + G1).

But from Strand 1, we have (A1 + G1)/(T1 + C1) = 0.3.

So let me call (A1 + G1) = x, (T1 + C1) = y.

So x/y = 0.3 → x = 0.3 y.

Then the ratio in Strand 2 is (y)/(x) = y/(0.3 y) = 1/(0.3) ≈ 3.333... So approximately 3.33.

Wait, that's for part (a). So the ratio in the complementary strand is 3.33.

What about part (b), the ratio for the entire molecule?

The entire molecule is both strands. So in the entire DNA duplex, the counts are A1 + A2, T1 + T2, etc.

But wait, for the entire DNA, the A and T are in both strands. Wait, no, in a duplex, each A in one strand pairs with T in the other, so overall, the number of A's in the entire molecule is A1 + A2. But A2 is the number of T in Strand 1. So A1 + A2 = A1 + T1.

Similarly, T1 + T2 = T1 + A1.

Wait, but when you have the entire molecule, the sum of A and T would be A1 + T1 + A2 + T2?

Wait, no, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me think differently. The entire molecule is Strand 1 and Strand 2 together. So for the entire DNA, the total A would be A1 (from Strand1) + A2 (from Strand2). But as A2 = T1, the total A is A1 + T1.

Similarly, the total T would be T1 (Strand1) + T2 (Strand2) = T1 + A1.

Same for G and C: total G = G1 + G2 = G1 + C1.

Total C = C1 + C2 = C1 + G1.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the ratio (A + G)/(T + C) for the entire molecule. Let me compute that.

So, A_total = A1 + A2 = A1 + T1.

T_total = T1 + T2 = T1 + A1.

G_total = G1 + G2 = G1 + C1.

C_total = C1 + C2 = C1 + G1.

So the ratio is (A_total + G_total) / (T_total + C_total) = [ (A1 + T1) + (G1 + C1) ) ] / [ (A1 + T1) + (G1 + C1) ) ] → numerator and denominator are the same, so the ratio is 1.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, because in the entire DNA, the (A + G) would be (A1 + T1) + (G1 + C1) → (A1 + T1 + G1 + C1).

And (T + C) would be (T1 + A1) + (C1 + G1) → same as above. So their ratio is 1.

So for part (b), the entire molecule's ratio is 1.

Wait, that's interesting. So for any duplex DNA, the overall (A+G)/(T+C) ratio is 1 because each strand's contributions add up to the same numerator and denominator.

Now, moving to part (c): If the [(A + T)/(C + G)] ratio is 0.3, what is the ratio in the complementary strand and in the entire molecule?

Hmm. So the given ratio is (A + T)/(C + G) = 0.3 in one strand.

Let me think about this. Let me denote Strand 1 again.

So, for Strand 1: (A1 + T1)/(C1 + G1) = 0.3.

We need to find the same ratio for the complementary strand (Strand 2), and then the ratio for the entire molecule.

First, let's find the ratio in Strand 2.

In Strand 2, the A's are T1, T's are A1, C's are G1, G's are C1.

So, A2 = T1, T2 = A1, C2 = G1, G2 = C1.

So, the ratio in Strand 2 is (A2 + T2)/(C2 + G2) = (T1 + A1)/(G1 + C1).

Wait, that's the same as (A1 + T1)/(C1 + G1), which is the same as Strand 1's ratio. Because addition is commutative.

So, Strand 2's ratio is also (A1 + T1)/(C1 + G1) = 0.3.

Wait, that's interesting. Because in this case, the ratio remains the same in the complementary strand.

Wait, let me check.

Strand1: (A + T)/(C + G) = 0.3.

Strand2: (T1 + A1)/(G1 + C1) = same as (A1 + T1)/(C1 + G1) = 0.3.

So, the ratio in the complementary strand is the same as in Strand1, 0.3.

Now, what about the entire molecule's ratio?

So, for the entire DNA, (A_total + T_total)/(C_total + G_total).

Wait, let me compute A_total, T_total, etc.

A_total = A1 + A2 = A1 + T1.

T_total = T1 + T2 = T1 + A1.

So A_total + T_total = (A1 + T1) + (T1 + A1) = 2(A1 + T1).

Similarly, C_total = C1 + C2 = C1 + G1.

G_total = G1 + G2 = G1 + C1.

So C_total + G_total = (C1 + G1) + (G1 + C1) ) = 2(C1 + G1).

So the ratio is [2(A1 + T1)] / [2(C1 + G1)] → the 2s cancel out, so (A1 + T1)/(C1 + G1) = 0.3.

So the entire molecule's ratio is 0.3.

Wait, so for part (c), the ratio in the complementary strand is 0.3, and the entire molecule's ratio is also 0.3.

Now, let me summarize what I have.

(a) The complementary strand's ratio is 3.33, which is 10/3 ≈3.333.

Wait, 0.3 is 3/10, so the inverse is 10/3, which is approximately 3.333.

(b) Entire molecule's ratio is 1.

(c) Complementary strand's ratio is 0.3, and entire is 0.3.

Now, looking at the options, each option has three numbers: I think they correspond to (a), (b), (c) respectively.

Wait, the options are given as three numbers, so I think in the order (a), (b), (c). Let me check.

Option C is 3.3, 1, 0.3.

Wait, option C: 3.3, 1, 0.3.

But let me see each part.

For part (a): 3.333, so 3.3 would make sense.

Part (b): 1, as I found.

Part (c): The complementary strand's ratio is 0.3, and the entire's is 0.3.

So option C's third number is 0.3, which matches.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is: 3.3, 1, 0.3.

Yes, that would correspond to (a)=3.3, (b)=1, (c)=0.3.

Wait, but part (c) has two parts: the complementary strand and the entire molecule. So in the options, the third value probably represents both. Or perhaps in the options, each part has two values. Wait, maybe the option's third entry is for the entire molecule in part (c), but I'm not sure.

Wait, the original question for part (c): "what is the ratio in the complementary strand and in the entire molecule?"

So, perhaps the third value is for the entire molecule, and the complementary strand's ratio is also 0.3.

Wait, in the option, the third number would be for the entire molecule's ratio (0.3), and the complementary strand's ratio is the same as the given (0.3).

Wait, but looking at the options, each option has three numbers. So perhaps the first number is part (a), the second part (b), and the third part (c)'s entire molecule's ratio. But I'm not entirely sure.

But looking at the options, option C is 3.3, 1, 0.3.

Which fits:

(a) 3.3,

(b) 1,

(c) entire molecule's ratio is 0.3.

So, the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, let me double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in part (c). Let me think again.

In part (c), the given ratio is (A+T)/(C+G) = 0.3 in Strand1.

The complementary strand's ratio (A2+T2)/(C2+G2) would be (T1 + A1)/(G1 + C1) → same as (A1+T1)/(C1+G1) = 0.3.

So the complementary strand's ratio is same as Strand1's, 0.3.

The entire molecule's ratio is also 0.3, as we saw.

So part (c)'s complementary strand is 0.3, and entire is 0.3.

But the options don't have that as the third entry. Wait, the options are a triplet, so perhaps the third entry is the entire's ratio, and the complementary is same as given, but that's not how the options are structured.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the way the options are presented. Let me re-examine the question.

The options are presented as A through J, each with three values. And the question asks for (a), (b), and (c).

So each option is (a, b, c).

So for option C: a=3.3, b=1, c=0.3.

Which is exactly what I found.

So the correct answer should be option C.

The problem involves analyzing base composition ratios in DNA strands. The key points are as follows:

1. **Part (a):** The given ratio in one strand is \((A + G)/(T + C) = 0.3\). In the complementary strand, the ratio becomes \((T + C)/(A + G)\), which is the reciprocal of the original ratio. Thus, the ratio in the complementary strand is \(1/0.3 = 3.333\), approximately \(3.3\).

2. **Part (b):** For the entire DNA molecule, the ratio \((A + G)/(T + C)\) is calculated by summing the contributions from both strands. Since the strands are complementary, the total \(A + G\) equals the total \(T + C\), making the ratio for the entire molecule equal to \(1\).

3. **Part (c):** If the ratio \((A + T)/(C + G) = 0.3\) in one strand, the complementary strand will have the same ratio because \((A + T)/(C + G)\) remains unchanged when swapping complementary bases. For the entire molecule, the ratio is also \(0.3\), as the contributions from both strands are combined.

### Summary of Results:
- **(a):** The ratio in the complementary strand is \(3.3\).
- **(b):** The ratio for the entire molecule is \(1\).
- **(c):** The ratio in the complementary strand and the entire molecule is \(0.3\).

### Correct Option:
The option that matches these results is **C: 3.3, 1, 0.3**.
