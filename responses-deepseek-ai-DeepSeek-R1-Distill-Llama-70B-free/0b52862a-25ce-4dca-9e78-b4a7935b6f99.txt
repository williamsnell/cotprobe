Okay, so I've got this accounting problem here, and I need to find the net profit for Spring Hills Bakery for the month ended June 30. Hmm, let's see what information I have.

First, I remember that net profit is calculated by subtracting total expenses from total revenue. So, Net Profit = Total Revenues - Total Expenses. But wait, what counts as revenues and expenses here?

Looking at the given data:

- Revenue from Sales is $4,400. That's straightforward, the total sales made during the month.
- Sales Returns are $140. Oh right, sales returns are like when customers return items, so that reduces the revenue. So I think I need to subtract this from the sales to get the net sales.
  
So, Net Sales = Sales Revenue - Sales Returns. That would be $4,400 minus $140, which equals $4,260. Got that part.

Now, I need to calculate the cost of goods sold (COGS) because that's an expense that comes directly from the sales. COGS is calculated using the inventory data provided. The formula I remember is:

COGS = Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory.

Let me plug in the numbers:

- Beginning Inventory on June 1 is $6,500.
- Purchases during June are $2,200.
- Ending Inventory on June 30 is $5,900.

So COGS = 6,500 + 2,200 - 5,900. Let me compute that: 6,500 + 2,200 is 8,700, minus 5,900 equals $2,800. So COGS is $2,800.

Wait, but is that correct? Let me double-check. Yes, because the total goods available for sale are beginning inventory plus purchases, and then you subtract what's left at the end to find out what was sold, which is COGS. So that's correct.

Next, I need to look at the operating expenses. The problem lists several expenses:

- Salary Expense: $750
- Telephone Expense: $20
- Rent Expense: $125
- Miscellaneous Expenses: $45

I think all of these are operating expenses, so I should add them up. Let's calculate:

$750 (salary) + $20 (telephone) = $770. Then add $125 (rent) makes $895, plus $45 (misc) brings it to $940. So total operating expenses are $940.

Wait, but wait. Is there any other expense? Let me check the data again. No, that's all. So total expenses are COGS plus operating expenses.

So total expenses = COGS ($2,800) + operating expenses ($940) = $3,740.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, COGS is part of the expenses, right. So yes, that's correct.

Now, going back to net profit: Net Sales ($4,260) minus total expenses ($3,740). Let me compute that: 4,260 - 3,740 equals $520.

So the net profit should be $520. Let me look at the options. Option D is $520. So the answer should be D.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let's recalculate each step.

Net Sales: 4,400 - 140 = 4,260. Correct.

COGS: 6,500 + 2,200 = 8,700. 8,700 - 5,900 = 2,800. Correct.

Operating Expenses: 750 + 20 + 125 +45.

750 +20 is 770. 770 + 125 is 895. 895 +45 is 940. So yes, 940. 

Total expenses: 2,800 + 940 = 3,740.

Net Profit: 4,260 - 3,740 = 520. Yep, that's $520, which is option D.

To calculate the net profit for Spring Hills Bakery for the month ended June 30, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Net Sales**:  
   Net Sales = Revenue from Sales - Sales Returns  
   Net Sales = $4,400 - $140 = **$4,260**.

2. **Calculate Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**:  
   COGS = Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory  
   COGS = $6,500 + $2,200 - $5,900 = **$2,800**.

3. **Calculate Total Operating Expenses**:  
   Total Operating Expenses = Salary Expense + Telephone Expense + Rent Expense + Miscellaneous Expenses  
   Total Operating Expenses = $750 + $20 + $125 + $45 = **$940**.

4. **Calculate Total Expenses**:  
   Total Expenses = COGS + Total Operating Expenses  
   Total Expenses = $2,800 + $940 = **$3,740**.

5. **Calculate Net Profit**:  
   Net Profit = Net Sales - Total Expenses  
   Net Profit = $4,260 - $3,740 = **$520**.

From the given options, the correct answer is **D: $520**.
