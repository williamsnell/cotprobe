Okay, so I have this problem here about the order of an element in a direct product of two cyclic groups, specifically Z_12 cross Z_8. The element in question is (4, 2). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my group theory, but I'll try to work through this step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with the direct product of two groups, the order of an element (a, b) is the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of a in the first group and b in the second group. Oh wait, right, because the operation is component-wise. So I need to find the order of 4 in Z_12 and the order of 2 in Z_8 separately, and then find their LCM.

Let me start with the first part: the order of 4 in Z_12. The order of an element a in Z_n is the smallest positive integer m such that m*a ≡ 0 mod n. So for 4 in Z_12, I'm looking for the smallest m where 4m is a multiple of 12. Let's calculate that.

4m mod 12 should be 0. Let's try m=1: 4*1=4 mod12 !=0. m=2:8 mod12 !=0. m=3:12 mod12=0. So the order of 4 in Z_12 is 3. Okay, that's clear.

Now the second part: the order of 2 in Z_8. Same approach. Find the smallest m where 2m ≡0 mod8. Let's see:

m=1: 2 mod8=2≠0. m=2:4≠0. m=3:6≠0. m=4:8 mod8=0. So the order of 2 in Z_8 is 4.

Now, to find the order of the element (4,2) in the direct product group, I take the LCM of the two orders we found. So LCM of 3 and 4. Let's think: the multiples of 3 are 3,6,9,12... and multiples of 4 are 4,8,12... The smallest common one is 12. So the order should be 12.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me check each step again.

For Z_12, the element 4: trying m=3, 4*3=12≡0 mod12. Correct. And for Z_8, 2: m=4, 2*4=8≡0 mod8. Correct.

So LCM(3,4)=12. Therefore, the order is 12. Looking at the options, option G is 12. So the answer should be G.

The order of an element \((a, b)\) in the direct product \( \mathbb{Z}_m \times \mathbb{Z}_n \) is the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of \(a\) in \( \mathbb{Z}_m \) and \(b\) in \( \mathbb{Z}_n \). 

1. **Order of \(4\) in \( \mathbb{Z}_{12} \):**  
   The order of \(4\) is the smallest positive integer \(m\) such that \(4m \equiv 0 \mod 12\).  
   - \(m = 1\): \(4 \cdot 1 = 4 \not\equiv 0 \mod 12\)  
   - \(m = 2\): \(4 \cdot 2 = 8 \not\equiv 0 \mod 12\)  
   - \(m = 3\): \(4 \cdot 3 = 12 \equiv 0 \mod 12\)  
   Thus, the order of \(4\) in \( \mathbb{Z}_{12} \) is \(3\).

2. **Order of \(2\) in \( \mathbb{Z}_8 \):**  
   The order of \(2\) is the smallest positive integer \(m\) such that \(2m \equiv 0 \mod 8\).  
   - \(m = 1\): \(2 \cdot 1 = 2 \not\equiv 0 \mod 8\)  
   - \(m = 2\): \(2 \cdot 2 = 4 \not\equiv 0 \mod 8\)  
   - \(m = 3\): \(2 \cdot 3 = 6 \not\equiv 0 \mod 8\)  
   - \(m = 4\): \(2 \cdot 4 = 8 \equiv 0 \mod 8\)  
   Thus, the order of \(2\) in \( \mathbb{Z}_8 \) is \(4\).

3. **Order of \((4, 2)\) in \( \mathbb{Z}_{12} \times \mathbb{Z}_8 \):**  
   The order is the LCM of the orders of \(4\) and \(2\), which are \(3\) and \(4\), respectively.  
   - \( \text{LCM}(3, 4) = 12 \).  

Therefore, the order of the element \((4, 2)\) is \(12\).
