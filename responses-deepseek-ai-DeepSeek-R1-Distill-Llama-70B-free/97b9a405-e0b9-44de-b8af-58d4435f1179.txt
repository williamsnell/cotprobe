Okay, so I have this economics question about production possibilities frontiers (PPFs) and why they're concave to the origin. Hmm, I remember PPFs from my studies. The PPF shows the maximum combinations of two goods that an economy can produce given its resources and technology.

The question is asking why the PPF is concave, meaning it curves inward. I think it's related to the idea of increasing costs. Oh right, the law of increasing costs! Wait, why does that happen?

So, when you produce more of one good, you have to use resources that are better suited for another good. Like, if you're producing more guns, you might have to shift resources from making butter. But those resources might not be as efficient in producing guns, so each additional unit of guns costs more butter than the previous one. This increasing opportunity cost makes the PPF curve inward.

Looking at the options, option G is "of the law of increasing costs." That makes sense. What about the other options? Option A is comparative advantage, which is more about trade between countries, not the shape of the PPF itself. Option B, fixed resources, well, yes, resources are fixed, but that explains why there's a frontier, not why it's concave. Option C, scarcity is a general concept, but again, not the curvature. Option D, decreasing costs, would actually make the PPF concave outward, I think, because you'd get more efficient as you produce more. Option E, inefficienciesâ€”PPFs assume efficiency, so that's not it. Option F, law of demand and supply, not directly related here. Option H, constant opportunity costs would make the PPF a straight line, so that's incorrect. Option I, economies of scale, would also lead to decreasing costs, so same as D. Option J, opportunity cost, yes, but it's specifically increasing opportunity costs that cause the concave shape.

So the correct answer should be G.

The production possibilities frontier (PPF) is concave to the origin due to the law of increasing costs. As an economy produces more of one good, it must allocate resources that are less suited for that good, leading to higher opportunity costs. This results in the inward curvature of the PPF. Among the options provided, the law of increasing costs (Option G) directly explains this phenomenon.

Answer: G
