Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about property law, specifically dealing with estates and future interests. Hmm, I remember from my studies that this is all about how property is held and transferred over time. Let me try to break this down.

The question says that an uncle owns a property in fee simple, which I think means he has absolute ownership. He executes and delivers a deed with a specific granting clause. The clause reads: "To my nephew and my niece for the life of my nephew, then to my gardener."

I need to figure out what each person's interest is after this grant. The options are A through J, and each describes different legal arrangements. Let's start by parsing the granting clause.

First, the property is given to the nephew and niece "for the life of my nephew." So, that part is a life estate, right? Because it's limited to the duration of someone's lifeâ€”in this case, the nephew's life. But wait, it's granted to both the nephew and the niece. So, do they each have a life estate, or is it a joint life estate?

I think when two people are granted a life estate together, they hold it as joint tenants. But wait, the wording says "for the life of my nephew." So it's not the lives of both the nephew and niece, just the nephew's life. That means the life estate is measured by the nephew's life. So both the nephew and niece have a life estate that will last until the nephew dies. But when the nephew dies, the estate ends, regardless of whether the niece is still alive.

Wait, but can a life estate be held by multiple people? Yes, I think so. So here, the nephew and niece are both life tenants, but the duration is tied to the nephew's life. So their life estate is for the nephew's life. Hmm. So if the nephew dies before the niece, the life estate ends, and the property passes to the next in line, which is the gardener.

So after the life estate, the remainder goes to the gardener. But what kind of remainder is that? Since the life estate is for the nephew's life, once he dies, the property goes to the gardener. So the gardener has a vested remainder because it's a future interest that is certain to take effect when the prior estate ends. Wait, but what if the nephew dies, but the niece is still alive? No, because the life estate ends when the nephew dies, so the niece's interest ends then too.

Wait, so the initial grant is to the nephew and niece for the life of the nephew. So their life estate is a joint life estate, but it's measured by the nephew's life. So when the nephew dies, the life estate ends, and the gardener gets the property.

So the nephew and niece each have a life estate, but it's measured by the nephew's life. So when the nephew dies, both their interests end. So the gardener has a vested remainder in fee simple because it's a guaranteed future interest once the life estate ends.

Now looking at the options:

Option A says the nephew has a life estate pur autre vie, the niece has a vested remainder, and the gardener has a life estate. Hmm. Wait, the nephew's life estate is measured by his own life, not someone else's, so it's not pur autre vie. So A might be incorrect.

Option B: The nephew and niece are tenants in common for the life of the first to die, and both have contingent remainders, and the gardener has an executory interest. Wait, I'm not sure. The grant is for the life of the nephew, not the first to die. So this might not fit.

Option C: Nephew and niece are joint tenants with survivorship, and gardener has a contingent remainder. If they were joint tenants, the survivor would take the entire life estate, but the grant is for the life of the nephew. If the nephew dies before the niece, the life estate ends. So the niece wouldn't get the full life estate beyond the nephew's death. So maybe this doesn't fit.

Option D: Nephew and niece are tenants in common, and gardener has a vested remainder. Wait, tenants in common would mean they each have a life estate for the nephew's life, but as tenants in common, not joint. So each has a share, but when the nephew dies, both their interests end. So the gardener's remainder is vested because it's certain to happen when the life estate ends. So D could be correct.

Option E: They're joint tenants in fee simple defeasible, which doesn't make sense because the grant is for a life estate, not fee simple.

Option F: Nephew has a vested remainder, which doesn't fit because he has a present life estate.

Option G: Both have life estates pur autre vie. No, their life estates are measured by the nephew's life, which is his own life, so not pur autre vie.

Option H: Nephew has a life estate, niece has a life estate pur autre vie, and gardener has a vested remainder. Wait, the niece's estate is tied to the nephew's life, so it's also a life estate measured by his life, so she doesn't have a pur autre vie.

Option I: Nephew has a life estate, niece has a vested remainder, gardener has a life estate pur autre vie. No, because the remainder goes to the gardener, not the niece. So I don't think that's right.

Option J: Both nephew and niece have a life estate, and gardener has a vested remainder. So this fits because the initial grant is for the life of the nephew, so both have a life estate, and when the nephew dies, the property goes to the gardener as a vested remainder. So J says exactly that.

Wait, but in the grant, it's "to my nephew and my niece for the life of my nephew." So both have a present life estate, but it's measured by the nephew's life. So when he dies, their estates end, and the gardener's remainder takes effect. So the niece's life estate is only as long as the nephew is alive. So the niece doesn't have a vested remainder; she has a present life estate. So in J, it says both have a life estate, which is correct.

So looking at the options, option J is correct. The nephew and niece each have a life estate, and the gardener has a vested remainder. 

Wait, but let me double-check. In a joint life estate, if it's for the life of one, say A and B for the life of A, then when A dies, the life estate ends, and B's interest ends too. So yes, the remainder is vested because it's certain to take effect when A dies.

So the correct answer should be J.

The uncle owns the property in fee simple and executes a deed with the granting clause: "To my nephew and my niece for the life of my nephew, then to my gardener." This creates a life estate for the nephew and niece, measured by the nephew's life, with the remainder going to the gardener.

The nephew and niece are granted a joint life estate, but it is limited to the duration of the nephew's life. This means that when the nephew dies, the life estate ends, and the property passes to the gardener. The gardener's interest is a vested remainder because it is certain to take effect once the life estate terminates.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The nephew's life estate is measured by his own life, not someone else's, so it is not "pur autre vie."
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The life estate is not tied to the first of the nephew or niece to die but specifically to the nephew's life.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The nephew and niece are not joint tenants with survivorship because the life estate ends when the nephew dies, regardless of whether the niece survives.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. While the gardener has a vested remainder, the nephew and niece are not tenants in common; they hold a joint life estate.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The grant does not create a fee simple defeasible for the nephew and niece.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The nephew has a present life estate, not a vested remainder.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The life estates are measured by the nephew's life, not "pur autre vie."
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The niece does not have a life estate "pur autre vie"; her interest is tied to the nephew's life.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The niece does not have a vested remainder; she has a life estate.
- **Option J**: Correct. The nephew and niece both have a life estate measured by the nephew's life, and the gardener has a vested remainder in fee simple.

Thus, the most accurate statement is that the nephew and niece each have a life estate, and the gardener has a vested remainder.
