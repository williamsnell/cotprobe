Okay, so I have this math problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about finding the limit as n approaches infinity of (2n)!! divided by (2n+1)!!. Hmm, I remember that double factorial notation can be a bit tricky, so I need to make sure I understand what (2n)!! and (2n+1)!! mean.

Wait, right, the double factorial of an even number is the product of all the even integers up to that number. So (2n)!! is 2 * 4 * 6 * ... * 2n. Similarly, for an odd number, (2n+1)!! is 1 * 3 * 5 * ... * (2n+1). So they’re products of even and odd numbers respectively.

I think I should express these double factorials in terms of regular factorials to make it easier to handle. I remember that for an even number, (2n)!! is equal to 2^n * n!. Because each term is a multiple of 2, so factoring out 2s gives 2^n times the product of 1 through n, which is n!.

What about the odd double factorial? Oh right, (2n+1)!! can be expressed using factorials as well. I think the formula is (2n+1)!! = (2n+1)!)/(2^n n!). Let me check that. So the product of odd numbers up to 2n+1 is (2n+1)! divided by the product of even numbers, which is (2^n n!). So yeah, (2n+1)!! = (2n+1)! / (2^n n!).

So substituting these back into the original expression, the limit becomes [2^n n!] / [(2n+1)!/(2^n n!)].

Wait, that would be (2n)!! divided by (2n+1)!!. So substituting gives:

(2^n n!) / [ (2n+1)! / (2^n n!) ) ] = (2^n n!) * (2^n n!) ) / (2n+1)! )

So simplifying that, it's (2^(2n) (n!)^2) / (2n+1)!.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's helpful. Maybe I should consider Stirling's approximation for factorials. Stirling's formula approximates n! as sqrt(2πn) (n/e)^n. So perhaps applying that here would help.

Let me write down Stirling's approximation for n! and (2n+1)!.

n! ≈ sqrt(2πn) (n/e)^n

Similarly, (2n+1)! ≈ sqrt(2π(2n+1)) ( (2n+1)/e )^{2n+1}.

Wait, but (2n+1) is approximately 2n when n is large, so maybe I can approximate (2n+1) as 2n for the leading terms, since higher-order terms become negligible as n approaches infinity.

So let me proceed with that. So substituting into our expression:

(2^(2n) (n!)^2) / (2n+1)! ≈ [2^(2n) (sqrt(2πn) (n/e)^n )^2 ] / [sqrt(2π(2n)) ( (2n)/e )^{2n} * (2n+1) ) ]

Wait, because (2n+1)! is (2n+1) multiplied by (2n)!.

Wait no, (2n+1)! = (2n+1) * (2n)!.

But wait, perhaps I should re-express (2n+1)! as (2n+1) * (2n)!.

Alternatively, perhaps using Stirling for (2n+1)! as sqrt(2π(2n)) (2n/e)^{2n} multiplied by (2n+1). Because (2n+1)! = (2n+1) * (2n)!.

But let me proceed step by step.

First, let's compute (n!)^2:

(n!)^2 ≈ [sqrt(2πn) (n/e)^n]^2 = (2πn) (n^{2n}) / e^{2n} }

Then, 2^(2n) multiplied by that gives:

2^(2n) * (2πn) (n^{2n}) / e^{2n}.

So the numerator is 2^(2n) * (2πn) (n^{2n}) / e^{2n}.

Now the denominator is (2n+1)! which is approximately sqrt(2π(2n)) * (2n/e)^{2n} multiplied by (2n+1), because (2n+1)! = (2n+1) * (2n)!.

Wait, but (2n)! is approximated by sqrt(4πn) (2n/e)^{2n}.

Wait, because Stirling's formula for (2n)! is sqrt(4πn) (2n/e)^{2n}.

Therefore, (2n+1)! = (2n+1) * (2n)! ≈ (2n+1) * sqrt(4πn) (2n/e)^{2n}.

But as n becomes large, (2n+1) is approximately 2n, so perhaps we can approximate (2n+1) as 2n. So:

(2n+1)! ≈ 2n * sqrt(4πn) (2n/e)^{2n}.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, I could express (2n+1)! as (2n+1) multiplied by (2n)!.

Wait, maybe it's better to use the approximation for (2n+1)! directly.

Using Stirling's formula for (2n+1)!:

(2n+1)! ≈ sqrt(2π(2n+1)) * ( (2n+1)/e )^{2n+1}.

But when n is large, 2n+1 ≈ 2n, so sqrt(2π(2n+1)) ≈ sqrt(4πn) = 2 sqrt(π n).

Similarly, (2n+1)/e ≈ (2n)/e, so ( (2n+1)/e )^{2n+1} ≈ (2n/e)^{2n} * (2n/e).

Putting it together:

(2n+1)! ≈ 2 sqrt(π n) * (2n/e)^{2n} * (2n/e).

So now, putting numerator and denominator together:

Numerator: 2^(2n) * (2πn) (n^{2n}) / e^{2n}.

Denominator: 2 sqrt(π n) * (2n/e)^{2n} * (2n/e).

Wait, let me write it out:

Limit ≈ [2^(2n) * (2πn) (n^{2n}) / e^{2n}] ] / [2 sqrt(π n) * (2n/e)^{2n} * (2n/e) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator.

First, let me look at the (2n/e)^{2n} terms. They appear in both numerator and denominator.

Wait, the numerator has (n^{2n}) and the denominator has (2n/e)^{2n}.

Wait, wait, the numerator's n^{2n} is part of (n!)^2. The denominator's (2n/e)^{2n} is from (2n)!.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the numerator and denominator to make it clearer.

Wait, the numerator is 2^(2n) * (n!)^2.

Expressed via Stirling, that's 2^(2n) * [sqrt(2πn) (n/e)^n ]^2.

Which is 2^(2n) * (2πn) (n^{2n}/e^{2n}).

So numerator becomes 2^(2n) * 2πn * n^{2n} / e^{2n}.

Denominator is (2n+1)! which via Stirling is sqrt(2π(2n+1)) * ( (2n+1)/e )^{2n+1}.

As I approximated earlier, for large n, this becomes approximately 2 sqrt(π n) * (2n/e)^{2n} * (2n/e).

So denominator ≈ 2 sqrt(π n) * (2n)^{2n} / e^{2n} ) * (2n/e).

Now, putting numerator and denominator together:

Limit ≈ [2^(2n) * 2πn * n^{2n} / e^{2n}] ] / [2 sqrt(π n) * (2n)^{2n} / e^{2n} * (2n/e) ) ]

Simplify term by term.

First, let's look at the terms involving 2.

Numerator has 2^(2n) and 2πn.

Denominator has 2 and (2n)^{2n}.

Wait, let's break it down.

The numerator can be written as 2^(2n) * 2 π n * (n^{2n}) / e^{2n}.

Denominator is 2 * sqrt(π n) * (2n)^{2n} / e^{2n} * (2n/e).

Wait, so let me write the entire fraction:

[2^(2n) * 2 π n * (n^{2n}) / e^{2n}] / [2 * sqrt(π n) * (2n)^{2n} / e^{2n} * (2n/e) ) ]

We can split this into multiple parts.

First, the 2 terms in numerator and denominator:

2^(2n) * 2 in numerator, and 2 in denominator.

So 2^(2n) * 2 / 2 = 2^(2n) * (2/2) = 2^(2n).

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-express:

The numerator has 2^(2n) and 2, so that's 2^(2n) * 2.

The denominator has 2. So 2^(2n) * 2 / 2 = 2^(2n).

Next, the π terms: numerator has π, denominator has sqrt(π n).

So that's π / sqrt(π n) = sqrt(π) / sqrt(n).

Wait, because sqrt(π n) is sqrt(π) * sqrt(n). So π divided by sqrt(π) is sqrt(π), and then divided by sqrt(n), so overall sqrt(π)/sqrt(n).

Wait, let me compute:

π / sqrt(π n) = π / (sqrt(π) * sqrt(n)) ) = sqrt(π) / sqrt(n).

Hmm, yes that's right.

Then, the terms involving n in the numerator's 2πn: Wait, no, the 2πn is part of the numerator from (n!)^2, which gives 2πn, but I think I have accounted for that in the π term.

Wait, perhaps I should handle each term step by step.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write the entire ratio.

The ratio is:

[2^(2n) * 2 π n * (n^{2n}) / e^{2n} ] divided by [ 2 * sqrt(π n) * (2n)^{2n} / e^{2n} * (2n/e) ) ]

Let me write it as:

(2^(2n) * 2 π n * n^{2n} / e^{2n}) ) * [1 / (2 * sqrt(π n) * (2n)^{2n} / e^{2n} * (2n/e) )) ]

Which is the same as:

(2^(2n) * 2 π n * n^{2n} / e^{2n}) ) * (e^{2n} ) / (2 * sqrt(π n) * (2n)^{2n} * (2n/e) )).

Wait, because dividing by denominator is same as multiplying by reciprocal. So the e^{2n} in the denominator becomes e^{2n} in the numerator, and I think I missed the (2n/e) term as well.

Wait, perhaps I should carefully multiply each term.

Let me reorganize:

Numerator terms:
- 2^(2n)
- 2 π n
- n^{2n}
- e^{-2n}

Denominator terms:
- 2
- sqrt(π n)
- (2n)^{2n}
- e^{-2n}
- 2n/e (since denominator has (2n/e) as a separate term)

Wait, no, let me re-express the denominator correctly.

Wait, the denominator of the original fraction is:

[2 * sqrt(π n) * (2n)^{2n} / e^{2n} ) * (2n/e) ) ]

So the denominator is 2 * sqrt(π n) * (2n)^{2n} / e^{2n} * (2n/e)

So when taking reciprocal, it becomes:

1/(2 * sqrt(π n)) ) * e^{2n}/( (2n)^{2n} ) ) * e/(2n)

So putting it all together, the entire expression becomes:

[2^(2n) * 2 π n * n^{2n} * e^{-2n} ] * [ e^{2n} / (2 * sqrt(π n) * (2n)^{2n} * (2n/e) ) ) ]

Wait, this seems complicated, but perhaps I can simplify term by term.

Let me compute each part:

1. 2^(2n) from numerator.

2. 2 π n from numerator.

3. n^{2n} from numerator.

4. e^{-2n} from numerator.

Multiply these together.

Now, multiply by the reciprocal of denominator:

5. 1/(2) from denominator.

6. 1/sqrt(π n) from denominator.

7. e^{2n}/( (2n)^{2n} ) from denominator.

8. e/(2n) from denominator.

So, let me write all terms together:

Term 1: 2^(2n)

Term 2: 2 π n

Term 3: n^{2n}

Term 4: e^{-2n}

Term 5: 1/2

Term 6: 1/(sqrt(π n)) )

Term 7: e^{2n}/(2n)^{2n}

Term 8: e/(2n)

So combining all terms, let's see:

Multiply all the constants, then the n terms, exponents, etc.

First, let's look at 2^(2n) * 2 π n * 1/2 * 1/sqrt(π n) * e^{-2n} * e^{2n} * e/(2n) * n^{2n}/(2n)^{2n}.

Wait, let's group similar terms.

Constants:

2^(2n) * 2 (from term 2) * 1/2 (term 5) * e (from term 8) * e^{-2n} * e^{2n} (terms 4 and 7).

Wait, e^{-2n} * e^{2n} = e^0 = 1.

So the e terms cancel out, leaving just e from term 8.

So constants now: 2^(2n) * 2 * (1/2) * e.

Simplify: 2^(2n) * (2 * 1/2) ) * e = 2^(2n) * 1 * e = e * 2^(2n).

Next, let's look at the pi and sqrt(pi n) terms.

We have π (from term 2) and 1/sqrt(π n) (term 6).

So π * 1/sqrt(π n) = sqrt(π) / sqrt(n).

Because π / sqrt(π n) = sqrt(π) / sqrt(n).

Then, the n terms.

We have n from term 2, and 1/sqrt(n) from term 6.

So n * 1/sqrt(n) = sqrt(n).

Wait, no. Wait, term 2 is 2 π n, and term 6 is 1/sqrt(π n). So the n from term 2 is multiplied by 1/sqrt(n) from term 6, giving sqrt(n). Because n^(1) * n^(-1/2) = n^(1/2) = sqrt(n).

Wait, but also, term 8 has a 1/(2n) term. So let me not forget that.

Wait, term 8 is e/(2n) = e * (1/(2n)).

So combining all the n terms:

From term 2: n

From term 6: 1/sqrt(n)

From term 8: 1/(2n)

Wait, perhaps it's better to collect all n terms.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express all terms:

Term 2: 2 π n → 2 π n

Term 6: 1/(sqrt(π) sqrt(n)) → 1/(sqrt(π) n^{1/2})

Term 8: e/(2n) → e/(2) * n^{-1}

So combining these, along with any other n terms.

Wait, perhaps I should write all the n exponents:

n from term 2: n^1

1/sqrt(n) from term 6: n^{-1/2}

1/(2n) from term 8: n^{-1}

So overall, n^{1 - 1/2 -1} = n^{-1/2}.

So the n terms combine to n^{-1/2}.

Putting it all together:

Constants: e * 2^(2n)

Pi terms: sqrt(π)/sqrt(n) → sqrt(π) n^{-1/2}

n terms: n^{-1/2} → so combining with the above, (sqrt(π) n^{-1/2}) * n^{-1/2} ) → sqrt(π) n^{-1}.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled here. Let me approach it differently.

Wait, let me collect all the factors step by step.

After handling constants and e terms, the remaining factors are:

From pi: sqrt(π)/sqrt(n)

From term 2: n

From term 8: 1/(2n)
