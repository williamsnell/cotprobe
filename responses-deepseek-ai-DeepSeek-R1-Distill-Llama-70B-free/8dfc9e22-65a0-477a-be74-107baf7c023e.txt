Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about finding the annual rate of growth of earnings for Quinones Bros after four years. The earnings function is given as the square root of (10t² + t + 236) in thousands of dollars. Hmm, I remember that growth rates often involve derivatives because they represent the rate of change.

Right, so the function here is E(t) = sqrt(10t² + t + 236). To find the rate of growth, I think I need to take the derivative of E with respect to t. Because the derivative will give me the instantaneous rate of change at any time t, which in this case would be after four years.

Wait, let me make sure. The annual rate of growth as a percentage—so that's like the percentage increase in earnings each year. So yeah, taking the derivative should give me the marginal earnings at time t, and then I can probably express that as a percentage of the current earnings to get the growth rate.

So, first, I'll write the function as E(t) = (10t² + t + 236)^(1/2). To find the derivative E’(t), I'll use the chain rule. The derivative of u^(1/2) is (1/(2√u)) * du/dt.

Let me compute the derivative step by step. Let u = 10t² + t + 236. Then du/dt = 20t + 1. So, E’(t) = (1/(2√u)) * (20t + 1).

Now, I need to evaluate this derivative at t=4, since we're looking for the growth rate after four years. So plugging t=4 into u:

u = 10*(4)^2 + 4 + 236 = 10*16 +4 +236 = 160 +4=164, 164+236=400. So u=400. √u is 20.

So E’(4) = (1/(2*20)) * (20*4 +1) = (1/40) * (80 +1) = (81)/40.

Wait, 81/40 is 2.025. Hmm, but wait, that's the derivative, which is the rate of change in thousands of dollars per year. But the question asks for the rate of growth as a percentage. So that's the growth rate, which I think is (E’(t)/E(t)) * 100%.

Because to get the percentage growth rate, you take (derivative / function value) * 100. So, E’(t) is the absolute growth, and E(t) is the current earnings. So their ratio gives the relative growth rate.

So E(t) at t=4 is sqrt(400) which is 20 (in thousands, so that's $20,000). E’(4) is 2.025 (thousands per year, so $2,025 per year).

Wait, no, wait. E(t) is in thousands, so when I take E’(t) which is dE/dt, it's also in thousands per year. So the units make sense.

So the growth rate percentage would be (E’(4)/E(4)) * 100% = (2.025 / 20) * 100.

Let me compute that: 2.025 divided by 20. 20 is 20, so 2.025/20 = 0.10125. Multiply by 100 gives 10.125%. Wait, but none of the options are 10.125%. Hmm, that doesn't match any of the options given.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me go through it again.

Compute u at t=4: 10*(4)^2 = 160, plus 4 is 164, plus 236 is 400. So u=400, correct. du/dt at t=4 is 20*4 +1 = 80 +1=81. So E’(4)= (1/(2*sqrt(400))) *81.

Wait, sqrt(400) is 20. So 2*20 is 40. So 81/40 is 2.025, yes. E(4) is 20.

So 2.025/20 = 0.10125, which is 10.125%. Hmm, but the options are in the 1-6% range. So something's wrong.

Wait, maybe I misunderstood the question. Let me read it again. It says the annual rate of growth after four years. Oh! Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the growth between year 3 and 4, or the average growth in the fourth year, instead of the instantaneous rate at t=4.

Alternatively, maybe the function models the earnings, and to find the growth rate, we can model it as a continuous growth model, where the rate is (dE/dt)/E.

Wait, but in the calculation above, that's exactly what I did. So why isn't it matching any of the options?

Wait the options are A:5%, B:2.5%, C:3.2%, etc. So 10% is not among them. So I must have made a mistake.

Is there another approach? Maybe using the formula for percentage growth rate, which is (E(t) at t - E(t) at t-1)/E(t-1) *100.

So perhaps instead of using calculus, the question expects a simple percentage change from t=3 to t=4.

Wait, perhaps that's the case. Let me try that.

Compute E(4) and E(3), then find the percentage increase from E(3) to E(4).

E(4) = sqrt(10*(4)^2 +4 +236) = sqrt(160 +4 +236) = sqrt(400) =20.

E(3)= sqrt(10*(3)^2 +3 +236) = sqrt(90 +3 +236) = sqrt(329). Let's compute that. 18^2=324, 19^2=361. So sqrt(329)= approx 18.14 (since 18^2=324, 18.1^2=327.61, 18.14^2= approx 329).

So E(3)= approx 18.14.

The change from t=3 to t=4 is 20 - 18.14 = 1.86 (thousands). So the percentage growth is (1.86 /18.14)*100.

1.86 /18.14 is approximately 0.1025 or 10.25%, which is again about 10%, which isn't in the options.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the model. Maybe the function represents something else.

Wait another thought: Oh wait! The problem says "the rate of growth of earnings after four years." Maybe the question is asking for the average annual growth rate over the four years, not the instantaneous rate at t=4. But the wording says "after four years," which might imply at that point in time, so I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the model is E(t) = sqrt(10t² + t +236). So the rate of growth is the derivative at t=4, which I found to be 2.025 (thousands per year), but the percentage is based on E(4), which is 20. So 2.025/20 = 10.125%, which isn't in the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E’(t). Let me try again.

E(t) = (10t² +t +236)^(1/2). So dE/dt = (1/2)(10t² +t +236)^(-1/2) * (20t +1). At t=4: denominator is sqrt(400)=20, so denominator in the derivative is 2*20=40. Numerator is 20*4 +1=81. So E’(4)=81/(40)=2.025. So that's correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the function is E(t) = sqrt(10 t^2 + t +236), but all terms are in thousands, so when taking the derivative, perhaps I should consider the units differently. Wait, no, because the function is E(t) in thousands, so E’(t) would be in thousands per year. So 2.025 thousands per year is 2025 per year, but as a growth rate relative to E(t)=20,000, the percentage would be (2025/20000)*100 = 10.125%, which still doesn't fit.

Looking at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivative calculation. Let me think again. Maybe I forgot to square something, but no, the chain rule seems correct.

Wait another approach: Maybe the function is intended to model continuous growth, so the growth rate would be found by setting the derivative equal to r * E(t), where r is the growth rate. So E’(t) = r * E(t). Solving for r gives r = E’(t)/E(t).

Which is exactly what I did earlier. So r = (81/40)/20 = 81/(40*20) = 81/800. Let me compute that: 81 divided by 800. 800 goes into 81 zero times. 800*0.1=80, so 0.10125. So 10.125%, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the function differently. Let me see: E(t)=sqrt(10t² +t +236) = sqrt(10t² +t +236). Let's see, perhaps this can be approximated as a linear function in t when t is large, but not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the percentage increase from t=3 to t=4, which would be the same as I tried earlier, giving about 10%, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating E(3). Let me compute E(3) again. E(3)= sqrt(10*(3)^2 +3 +236) = sqrt(90 +3 +236) = sqrt(329). Let me compute sqrt(329) more accurately.

18^2=324, so 18^2=324, 18.1^2= (18 +0.1)^2= 18^2 + 2*18*0.1 +0.1^2=324 +3.6 +0.01=327.61.

18.14^2: 18 +0.14. Let me compute it as (18 +0.14)^2 = 18^2 + 2*18*0.14 +0.14^2 = 324 + 5.04 + 0.0196= 329.0596, which is very close to 329. So sqrt(329)= approx 18.14.

So E(3)=18.14, E(4)=20. The difference is 1.86. So the growth rate is (1.86/18.14)*100 ≈ 10.25%, which still doesn't match any option.

Hmm, maybe the problem expects the calculation at t=4, but using the function's behavior. Alternatively, perhaps the function models the natural logarithm of earnings, but that's not stated here.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the options again. The options are all below 6%, and my calculations are giving around 10%, which isn't present. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, the function given is sqrt(10t² +t +236). Maybe that's supposed to model something else, but I don't see another way to interpret it.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the question is asking for the average annual growth rate over the four years, not the instantaneous rate at t=4. So, perhaps I should compute the percentage growth from t=0 to t=4, then find the average annual rate.

Wait, but that would be more complicated. Let me think. At t=0, E(0)=sqrt(0 +0 +236)=sqrt(236)= approx 15.362. At t=4, E(4)=20.

The average annual growth rate would be the geometric mean growth rate. So, if E(4)=E(0)*(1+r)^4.

So 20 = 15.362*(1+r)^4. Solving for r.

20/15.362 ≈1.3025. So (1+r)^4=1.3025. Take natural log: ln(1.3025)=4 ln(1+r). So ln(1.3025)≈0.263. So 4 ln(1+r)=0.263 → ln(1+r)=0.263/4≈0.06575. So 1+r= e^0.06575≈1.0679. So r≈6.79%. That's about 6.8%, which is still not matching the options, but closer to option D:6%.

But the question specifically asks for the rate after four years, not the average over four years. So perhaps that's not the right approach.

Wait, maybe I should think of it as a continuous growth model. If dE/dt = r E(t), then r would be dE/dt divided by E(t), which is exactly what I calculated earlier as 10.125%. So that's confusing because the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in interpreting the function. Maybe the square root is applied only to 10t^2, but that's not how it's written. The function is sqrt(10t² + t + 236).

Alternatively, perhaps the function is meant to represent the earnings in a way that the growth rate can be found without calculus, perhaps by approximation. Let me think.

Wait, maybe I should compute E(4) and E(5), and find the percentage increase from t=4 to t=5, to approximate the derivative. Let's try that.

E(4)=20 (thousands), as before.

E(5)=sqrt(10*25 +5 +236)=sqrt(250 +5 +236)=sqrt(491)= approx 22.136.

So the change from t=4 to t=5 is 22.136 -20 =2.136 (thousands). So the approximate derivative at t=4 would be about 2.136 per year, but since it's a one-year change, the instantaneous rate might be a bit higher, but perhaps the percentage would be (2.136/20)*100=10.68%, which is again higher than the options.

Wait, but maybe the question is actually asking for the percentage change between t=4 and t=3, which I calculated earlier as about 10.25%. But again, that doesn't match the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach. Maybe the function is intended to model something else. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps I should model the growth rate using the formula for exponential growth. So E(t) = E0 * e^(rt). But the given function isn't exponential; it's a square root of a quadratic. So that approach might not fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The function is E(t) = sqrt(10t² +t +236). The derivative is E’(t)= (20t +1)/(2*sqrt(10t² +t +236)).

At t=4, E’(4)=81/(2*20)=81/40=2.025. So the growth rate is 2.025 per year in thousands. So the percentage growth rate is (2.025 /20)*100=10.125%.

But the options don't have this. So something's wrong. Maybe the question is not asking for the instantaneous growth rate, but the average growth rate over the four years.

Wait, let's compute the average annual growth rate from t=0 to t=4.

At t=0: E(0)=sqrt(236)= approx 15.362.

At t=4: E(4)=20.

The average annual growth rate r would satisfy 15.362*(1+r)^4=20.

So (1+r)^4=20/15.362≈1.3025.

Taking the natural log: 4 ln(1+r)=ln(1.3025)=0.263.

So ln(1+r)=0.263/4≈0.06575.

So 1+r= e^0.06575≈1.0679. So r≈6.79%, which is approximately 6.8%. The closest option is D:6.00%, but it's not exact.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the growth rate at t=4, but using a different method. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivative.

Wait, another thought: The derivative E’(t) is the rate of change in earnings. So in dollars, it's 2.025 thousand dollars per year, which is $2025 per year. The current earnings at t=4 are $20,000. So the growth rate is 2025/20000=0.10125, which is 10.125%.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the question is asking for the percentage change from t=3 to t=4, which is (20 - sqrt(329))/sqrt(329) *100%.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately.

E(3)=sqrt(329)= approx 18.138.

E(4)=20.

The absolute change is 20 -18.138=1.862.

So the percentage change is (1.862/18.138)*100 ≈10.26%.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to be E(t) = (10t^2 +t +236)^0.5, but perhaps I should expand it differently.

Wait another approach: Let me see if the function can be approximated as a linear function for large t, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the growth rate using the formula for compound annual growth rate (CAGR). So between t=3 and t=4.

CAGR= (E(4)/E(3))^(1/1) -1 = (20/18.138) -1 ≈0.1025 or 10.25%.

Again, same result.

Wait, perhaps the options are wrong, or I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to model the growth differently.

Wait, perhaps the function is in terms of thousands of dollars, but the square root is only over part of the expression. Let me check the original problem statement.

The problem says: the gross annual earnings after t years to be sqrt(10t² +t +236) in thousands of dollars.

So the function is correct as I used it
