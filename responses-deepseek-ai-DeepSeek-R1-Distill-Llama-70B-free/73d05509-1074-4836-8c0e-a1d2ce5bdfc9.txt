The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A man filed a federal diversity action against a bus company, seeking damages for injuries he had sustained in an accident while riding a bus owned by the company. The man demanded a jury trial. After the parties' attorneys examined the prospective jurors and exercised their challenges, six jurors and two alternate jurors were chosen. During the trial, two jurors became ill and were replaced by the alternate jurors. At the conclusion of replaced by the alternate jurors. At the conclusion of the trial, a third juror also became ill, and the court excused that juror. The parties' attorneys stipulated to the return of a verdict from a five-person jury. The jury then deliberated and returned a verdict for the company. The man timely filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that the five-person jury was not large enough to return a verdict. Should the court grant the motion?

Options:

A: No, because the verdict was reached before the third juror was excused.
B: No, because the court properly excused the three jurors due to illness.
C: Yes, because there must be at least six jurors on a federal civil jury.
D: Yes, because there must be at least 12 jurors on a federal civil jury.
E: Yes, because the replacement of jurors during the trial invalidated the verdict.
F: Yes, because the stipulation of the attorneys cannot override federal jury size requirements.
G: No, because the parties stipulated to a verdict from a jury of fewer than six jurors.
H: No, because the illness of jurors is a valid reason for reducing the jury size.
I: No, because the remaining jurors were sufficient to reach a unanimous decision.
J: Yes, because the man was not given a fair trial due to the reduced jury size.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about federal civil procedure, specifically regarding jury trials. Let me see what I remember and try to work through it step by step.

The question involves a man who sued a bus company in federal court under diversity jurisdiction. He demanded a jury trial. They selected six jurors and two alternates. Then, during the trial, two jurors got ill and were replaced by the alternates. Later, a third juror became ill, and the court excused them. The parties stipulated to a five-person jury returning the verdict. The man is now moving for a new trial, arguing that a five-person jury isn't large enough.

I remember that in federal civil cases, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) govern the size of juries. Specifically, Rule 48 comes to mind, which deals with the number of jurors required. From what I recall, a federal civil jury must have at least six members. But wait, I think it's possible to have fewer if the parties agree. Let me think.

Wait, under Rule 48(b), a federal civil case may have a jury of six members. But can it be fewer? I think the rule says that juries in civil cases are typically six in number, but if the parties stipulate, they can agree to a jury as small as five. Or maybe even less, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I remember that the Supreme Court has held that the Constitution doesn't require a 12-person jury in civil cases, so federal rules can vary.

Wait, the initial setup was six jurors plus two alternates. Then two became ill, so the alternates came in, making it six again. Then a third became ill, leaving five. But the parties stipulated to continue with five. So the question is whether that's permissible.

I think FRCP allows for a jury of six, but if during the trial, jurors are unable to continue, the court may excuse them and proceed with the remaining jurors if the parties agree. So, if the parties stipulate, even lower than six might be possible? Or is six the minimum?

Wait, let me think. The Federal Rules say that a jury in a civil case "shall be of six persons..." (FRCP 48(a)). But then, in (b), it says that "any party may demand a jury trial by... specifying that the jury shall consist of a number not less than six nor more than twelve." Hmm, so the default is six, but parties can demand more, up to twelve. But can they go below six? Probably not, but the rules also talk about when jurors are unable to perform their duties.

Wait, there's another rule, maybe Rule 47 or something else. Oh, right, perhaps Rule 47 isn't relevant here. Maybe it's Rule 39. Let me think. Oh, Rule 39 deals with the failure of a jury to agree. But that's more about mistrials. Alternatively, Rule 47 might be about the examination of jurors, which isn't directly relevant.

Wait, another thought: I remember that in some cases, if a juror is excused, the alternates can be sworn in, but if all alternates are exhausted, the court can still proceed with fewer than six if the parties agree. So perhaps the minimum is five if the parties consent.

So in this case, after the third juror was excused, there were five left. The parties stipulated to accept a verdict from five. So, under the rules, is that allowed?

I think the answer hinges on whether a jury can be fewer than six if the parties agree. I believe that the Federal Rules allow for a stipulation to a smaller jury, even below six, as long as the parties agree. So, if the parties stipulate, the court can accept a verdict from five jurors.

Looking at the options:

Option C says yes because there must be at least six. But if the parties agreed, then maybe that's not the case. Option F says yes because the stipulation can't override federal requirements. But if the federal rules allow for a smaller jury with stipulation, then F would be incorrect.

Wait, let me check the exact rule. FRCP 48(a) says that a jury shall be of six persons. But (b) allows the parties to stipulate in writing to a larger or smaller number. Wait, no. Let me get the exact wording. 

Wait, from what I recall, Rule 48(b) says that any party may demand a jury trial by... specifying that the jury shall consist of a number not less than six nor more than twelve. So the minimum is six, but can the parties agree to fewer? Or is six the minimum?

Wait, maybe I'm confusing this with another rule. Another angle: the Seventh Amendment doesn't require a jury in civil cases to have 12 members. But federal courts typically use six-person juries. However, if during trial, jurors are excused, the court can proceed with the remaining jurors if the parties agree. So, for example, if you start with six, lose one, and the parties agree to continue with five, that's permissible.

So in this case, after the third juror was excused, the parties stipulated to five. So the court can accept the verdict from five.

Looking back at the options, option F says yes because the stipulation cannot override the federal requirements. But if the federal rules allow for stipulation to a smaller jury, then F is wrong. So the correct answer would be no, the court should not grant the motion for a new trial because the parties stipulated.

Wait, but I thought the minimum is six, but perhaps when jurors are excused, the parties can agree to fewer.

Alternatively, looking at the options again, option G says No, because the parties stipulated to a verdict from fewer than six. So that would imply that the parties' agreement is valid, so the court shouldn't grant the motion.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the initial jury must be at least six, but after excusing, if the parties agree, it can be less. So in this case, the parties stipulated, so the verdict is valid.

So the correct answer would be No, the court shouldn't grant the motion because the parties agreed to the five-person jury.

Looking at the options:

Option G says No because the parties stipulated to fewer than six.

Option F says Yes because stipulation can't override the federal size requirements.

But according to the rules, can the parties stipulate to a smaller jury? I think they can. So the court can accept it.

So the answer would be G: No, because the parties stipulated.

Wait, but I thought the initial rule requires at least six. Unless the rule allows the parties to agree to a smaller number. So perhaps the correct reasoning is that the parties can stipulate to a jury smaller than six, making the verdict valid.

So the man's motion should be denied because the parties agreed. So the answer would be G.

Wait, but another angle: the Supreme Court case Colgrove v. Battin (1973) allowed for six-person juries in federal civil cases, and also allowed for stipulation to even smaller juries if agreed upon.

So in this case, the parties agreed to five, so it's permissible. Therefore, the court should not grant the motion for a new trial.

So the correct answer would be G: No, because the parties stipulated to a verdict from fewer than six jurors.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing things up. The initial jury is six, but if during trial, the number drops below six with the parties' consent, that's allowed. So the motion shouldn't be granted because the stipulation is valid.

Looking at the options again, which ones match this reasoning.

Option C says Yes, because there must be at least six. That would suggest the motion should be granted, which would be incorrect if the parties can stipulate.

Option F says Yes because the stipulation can't override federal rules, implying that federal rules require at least six regardless of stipulation. But if the rules allow for stipulation, then F is wrong.

So the correct answer would be G: No, because the parties stipulated.

But wait, another point: the initial jury was six, then two alternates replaced two, making six again. Then a third was excused, making five. So the parties agreed to five. So the question is whether five is acceptable.

I think the answer is that the court can accept a verdict from five if the parties agree, so the motion should be denied. Therefore, the answer is G.

The question revolves around whether a federal civil jury can return a verdict with fewer than six jurors when the parties stipulate to it. In federal civil cases, the default jury size is six persons under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (FRCP) 48(a). However, FRCP 48(b) allows parties to stipulate to a jury size smaller than six, provided the stipulation is in writing. This means that if the parties agree to proceed with a smaller jury, the court can accept the verdict.

In this case, the jury started with six members, and two alternates replaced two jurors who became ill, maintaining six jurors. When a third juror became ill, the court excused them, leaving five jurors. The parties then stipulated to allow the five remaining jurors to return a verdict. Since the parties agreed to this arrangement, and federal rules permit such stipulations, the verdict from the five-person jury is valid.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The timing of the verdict relative to the third juror's excusal is irrelevant; the validity depends on the parties' stipulation.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. While illness may be a valid reason to excuse jurors, the key issue is whether the reduced jury size is permissible, which depends on the parties' stipulation.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The federal rules do not require at least six jurors if the parties stipulate to a smaller number.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Federal civil juries are not required to have 12 members; the default is six, and smaller juries are allowed with stipulation.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The replacement of jurors during the trial does not inherently invalidate the verdict; the issue is the jury size.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The parties' stipulation can override the default jury size requirement under federal rules.
- **Option G**: Correct. The parties stipulated to a verdict from a five-person jury, which is permissible under federal rules.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. While illness is a valid reason to excuse jurors, the key issue is the validity of the reduced jury size, which depends on the parties' stipulation.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The sufficiency of the remaining jurors to reach a unanimous decision is not the determining factor; the validity depends on the parties' stipulation.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The reduced jury size does not inherently result in an unfair trial if the parties agree to it.

The correct answer is **G**: No, because the parties stipulated to a verdict from a jury of fewer than six jurors.

Answer: G
