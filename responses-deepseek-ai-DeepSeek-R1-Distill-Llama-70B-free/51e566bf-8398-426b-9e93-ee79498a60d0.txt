Okay, so I've got this problem about an Earth satellite's orbit. Hmm, let's see. The question says the satellite has a perigee of 300 km and an apogee of 3,500 km above Earth's surface. I need to find how far the satellite is above Earth when it has moved 90 degrees around from perigee. The options are A to J, and I have to choose the correct one.

Wait, perigee is the closest point in the orbit, and apogee is the farthest. So the satellite is in an elliptical orbit around Earth. The distance from the center of the Earth would be the perigee plus Earth's radius at perigee, and similarly for apogee. But wait, do I need to consider Earth's radius? Oh, because the problem gives the heights above Earth's surface, so I should add Earth's radius to get the actual distances from Earth's center.

Wait, what's Earth's average radius? I remember it's about 6,371 km. So the perigee distance from Earth's center is 300 km + 6,371 km = 6,671 km. Similarly, the apogee is 3,500 + 6,371 = 9,871 km.

But wait, maybe I don't need to calculate that right away. The question is about the position after moving 90 degrees from perigee. So it's at a true anomaly of 90 degrees. Hmm, I'm trying to remember the equation for the radius in an elliptical orbit as a function of the true anomaly.

The formula is r(θ) = (a (1 - e²)) / (1 + e cos θ), where a is the semi-major axis, e is the eccentricity, and θ is the true anomaly.

So I need to find a and e first. Oh right, because I have the perigee (r_p) and apogee (r_a) distances. The semi-major axis a is the average of r_p and r_a. So a = (r_p + r_a)/2.

Wait, let me calculate that. r_p is 6,671 km, r_a is 9,871 km. So a = (6671 + 9871)/2. Let's add those: 6671 + 9871 is 16542. Divided by 2, a is 8271 km.

Okay, now the eccentricity e. The formula for e is (r_a - r_p)/(r_a + r_p). So plugging in the numbers: (9871 - 6671) / (9871 + 6671) = (3200) / (16542). Let me compute that. 3200 divided by 16542. Let me see, 3200 ÷ 16542 ≈ 0.1934. So e is approximately 0.1934.

Wait, let me double-check that. 9871 - 6671 is 3200. 9871 + 6671 is 16542. Yep, so 3200/16542 is about 0.1934. So e ≈ 0.193.

Now, the true anomaly θ is 90 degrees. So cos θ is cos(90°) which is zero. Oh wait, that makes it easier. The formula becomes r(90°) = (a (1 - e²)) / (1 + 0) = a (1 - e²).

So I just need to compute a*(1 - e²). Let's calculate e squared: e^2 is (0.1934)^2. Let's compute that. 0.1934 * 0.1934. Hmm, 0.19^2 is 0.0361. 0.0034^2 is negligible. But more accurately, 0.1934 * 0.1934. Let me compute 0.193 * 0.193. 0.19 * 0.19 is 0.0361, 0.003 * 0.19 is 0.00057, so adding cross terms... Wait, maybe a better approach: 1934 * 1934, then adjust decimal.

1934 * 1934: Let's compute 2000^2 =4,000,000. Subtract 66 * 2000*2 = 264,000, and add 66^2=4,356. Wait, no, that's for (2000-66)^2. Alternatively, let's compute 1934^2:

1934 × 1934: Let's break it down.

1934 × 1000 = 1,934,000
1934 × 900 = 1,740,600
1934 × 30 = 58,020
1934 ×4=7,736
Add them: 1,934,000 + 1,740,600 = 3,674,600; plus 58,020 is 3,732,620; plus 7,736 is 3,740,356.

So e^2 = 0.1934^2 = (1934e-4)^2 = (1934)^2 × 1e-8 = 3,740,356 × 1e-8 = 0.03740356.

So e² ≈ 0.0374.

So 1 - e² = 1 - 0.0374 = 0.9626.

Now, a is 8271 km. So r = a * 0.9626 = 8271 * 0.9626.

Let me calculate that. 8271 * 0.96 is approximately 8271 * 0.96. Let's see: 8271 * 1 = 8271. 8271 * 0.04 is 330.84. So 0.96 is 8271 - 330.84 = 7940.16. Then 8271 * 0.0026 is about 21.52. So total is approximately 7940 + 21.52 = 7961.52 km.

Wait, but wait, 0.9626 is 0.96 + 0.0026, so 8271 * 0.96 is 7940.16, and 8271 * 0.0026 is approximately 21.52 (since 8271 * 0.002 = 16.542, 8271 *0.0006=4.9626, so total 16.542 +4.9626=21.5046). So 7940.16 + 21.5046 = 7961.6646 km.

So the distance from Earth's center is about 7961.66 km.

Wait, but the question asks for the height above Earth's surface, so we need to subtract Earth's radius. Earth's radius is 6,371 km.

So 7961.66 - 6371 = let's compute that. 7961.66 - 6000 = 1961.66; 1961.66 - 371 = 1590.66 km.

Wait, that's approximately 1590.66 km. Let me check the options: Option I is 1590 km. So that's pretty close.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made an error in the steps.

Wait, let's go through the steps again.

1. Convert perigee and apogee heights to distances from Earth's center.

Perigee (r_p) = 300 km + 6371 km = 6671 km.

Apogee (r_a) = 3500 + 6371 = 9871 km.

2. Semi-major axis a = (r_p + r_a)/2 = (6671 +9871)/2 = 16542/2=8271 km. Correct.

3. Eccentricity e = (r_a - r_p)/(r_a + r_p) = (9871-6671)/(9871+6671) = 3200/16542 ≈ 0.1934. Correct.

4. True anomaly θ=90°, so cos θ=0. So r = a*(1-e²) = 8271 * (1 - (0.1934)^2).

Compute 0.1934²: 0.1934 *0.1934.

Let me compute 1934 * 1934 again. 1934 × 1934.

Wait, 1934 × 1000 = 1,934,000.

1934 × 900 = 1,740,600.

1934 × 30 = 58,020.

1934 ×4=7,736.

Adding them together: 1,934,000 +1,740,600 = 3,674,600.

3,674,600 +58,020=3,732,620.

3,732,620 +7,736=3,740,356.

So 1934²=3,740,356. So 0.1934² is 3,740,356e-8 = 0.03740356.

So 1 - e² = 0.96259644.

So r = 8271 * 0.96259644.

Let me compute 8271 *0.96259644.

Compute 8271 * 0.9 = 7443.9.

8271 * 0.06 = 496.26.

8271 * 0.00259644. Let me calculate that.

0.002 *8271=16.542.

0.00059644 *8271: 8271 *0.0005=4.1355.

8271 *0.00009644= approx 8271 *0.00009=0.74439. Then 8271 *0.00000644≈0.0532.

So 4.1355 +0.74439=4.87989 +0.0532 ≈4.93309.

Wait, but wait, 0.00059644 is 0.0005 + 0.00009644.

So 8271 *0.00059644 = 8271 * (0.0005 + 0.00009644) = 8271*(5e-4 + 9.644e-5) = let's compute 8271 *5e-4 =4.1355, and 8271 *9.644e-5.

9.644e-5 is 0.00009644, so 8271 * 0.00009644: let's compute 8271 *9644e-8.

Wait, 8271 *9644 = ?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute approximately. 8271 *0.00009644 ≈8271 *0.0001=0.8271, but since it's 0.9644% of that, so about 0.8271 *0.9644 ≈0.797. Wait, no, 0.00009644 is about 0.09644% of 8271, which is about 8271 *0.0009644.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me just accept that the exact value is 8271 * 0.96259644 = let me compute it step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 8271 × 0.96259644.

Wait, 8271 × 0.96259644 = ?

Let me write this as 8271 × (0.9 + 0.06 + 0.0025 + 0.00009644).

Wait, 0.96259644 = 0.9 + 0.06 + 0.0025 + 0.00009644.

So,

8271 × 0.9 = 7443.9

8271 ×0.06=496.26

8271 ×0.0025=20.6775

8271 ×0.00009644≈8271 ×0.0001=0.8271, but since it's 0.9644% of that, 0.8271 ×0.9644≈0.797.

Wait, no. Wait, 0.00009644 is 9.644e-5. So 8271 *9.644e-5 = (8271 *9.644) ×1e-5.

Compute 8271 ×9=745, 8271 ×0.644= let's see, 8271 ×0.6=4962.6, 8271 ×0.044=363.724. So total 4962.6 +363.724=5326.324. So 8271 ×9.644=8271*(9 +0.644)=745, (from 8271*9=745 (wait, wait, 8271 ×9 is 74,439? No, 8000×9=72,000, 271×9=2,439 → total 74,439. Oh wait, I think I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, 8271 ×9 = 74,439.

Then 8271 ×0.644: 8271 ×0.6=4,962.6; 8271 ×0.04=330.84; 8271 ×0.004=33.084. So 4962.6 +330.84=5,293.44 +33.084=5,326.524.

So 8271 ×9.644=74,439 +5,326.524=79,765.524.

Now multiply by 1e-5: 79,765.524 ×1e-5=7.9765524.

So 8271 ×0.00009644≈7.97655.

So adding all parts together:

7443.9 (from 0.9) 

+496.26 (0.06) → 7443.9 +496.26=7940.16

+20.6775 (0.0025) →7940.16+20.6775=7960.8375

+7.97655 (0.00009644) →7960.8375 +7.97655≈7968.814.

Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought it was about 7961.66. Hmm, perhaps I messed up the breakdown.

Alternatively, maybe I should use a calculator approach, but since I'm doing it manually, perhaps I'll accept that the exact value is approximately 7968 km, but earlier I thought it was 7961.66. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps it's better to just compute 8271 × 0.96259644.

Let me compute 8271 ×0.96259644.

Well, 8271 × 0.96259644 = ?

Let me write 0.96259644 as approximately 0.9626.

So 8271 × 0.9626 = ?

Compute as (8271 × 0.9) + (8271 × 0.06) + (8271 × 0.002) + (8271 × 0.0006).

Wait, 0.9626 is 0.9 +0.06 +0.002 +0.0006.

So 8271 ×0.9 =7443.9

8271 ×0.06=496.26 → total so far 7940.16

8271 ×0.002=16.542 → total 7956.702

8271 ×0.0006=4.9626 → total 7956.702 +4.9626=7961.6646 km.

Okay, that matches my earlier calculation. So r =7961.6646 km from Earth's center.

Then, subtract Earth's radius (6371 km) to get the height above surface: 7961.6646 -6371 = 1590.6646 km, which is approximately 1590.66 km. Looking back at the options, option I is 1590 km.

Wait, but let me double-check if I've done everything correctly. Because sometimes, for an ellipse, when you're at 90 degrees, the position is not just a*(1-e²), but perhaps I've made a mistake in using the formula.

Wait, the standard equation is r(θ) = (a (1-e²)) / (1 + e cos θ). So when θ=90°, cos θ=0, so denominator is 1. So yes, r = a(1-e²). So that part is correct.

Another way to think about it: at θ=90°, the position is at the end of the minor axis? Or maybe not exactly, but perhaps it's one of the points where the radius is a(1-e²). Hmm, I think that's correct.

Wait, another approach: The semi-minor axis is b = a * sqrt(1-e²). But the radius at θ=90° is equal to b, because in the ellipse, the minor axis is at 90°, so yes, r = a(1-e²). Because when θ=90°, the radius is the semi-minor axis, which is a*sqrt(1-e²). Wait, wait a minute, that's conflicting with my earlier calculation.

Wait, no. Wait, let me get this straight. The semi-minor axis length is b = a * sqrt(1-e²). But the distance from the center to the point at θ=90° would be equal to b, right? Because at θ=90°, the point is on the minor axis. So r = b = a * sqrt(1-e²). But earlier I used r = a*(1-e²). Wait, wait, which is it?

Ah, I think I made a mistake here. Because the formula is r = (a (1-e²))/(1 + e cos θ). So when θ=90°, cos θ=0, so r = a(1-e²). But wait, that's different from b, which is a * sqrt(1-e²).

Wait, that would mean that the distance at 90° is a*(1-e²), which is different from the semi-minor axis. Hmmm. So perhaps I was correct in my initial approach, and the semi-minor axis is a different concept.

Wait, to clarify, let me think about the ellipse parameters. The distance from the center to a focus is c = a e. The semi-minor axis is b = a sqrt(1-e²). The perigee is at r_p = a (1-e), and apogee is r_a = a (1+e).

Wait, no, wait: The perigee and apogee distances from the center are r_p = a (1 - e) and r_a = a (1 + e). Oh wait, no: No, that's not correct. Wait, no, the perigee is given by r_p = a (1 - e), and apogee r_a
