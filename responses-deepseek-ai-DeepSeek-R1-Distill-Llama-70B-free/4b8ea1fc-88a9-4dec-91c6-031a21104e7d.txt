Okay, so I've got this problem here where a teacher wants to invest $30,000 into an account that compounds annually. The interest rate is 1.8%, and we need to find out how much money will be in the account after 6 years. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my compound interest calculations, but I think I can figure this out.

Alright, compound interest... I remember there's a formula for that. Let me try to recall. Oh right, the formula is A equals P times (1 plus r) raised to the power of n. So A = P(1 + r)^n. Where A is the amount after n years, P is the principal amount, which is the initial investment, r is the annual interest rate, and n is the number of years.

So in this case, P is $30,000, r is 1.8%, which I think I need to convert to a decimal. Oh yeah, so 1.8% becomes 0.018. And n is 6 years. So plugging these into the formula, it should be A = 30000 * (1 + 0.018)^6.

Wait, let me make sure I got that right. 1.8% as a decimal is 0.018. Yep. And the exponent is the number of years, which is 6. So the calculation should be 30000 multiplied by (1.018) to the sixth power.

Now, let me think about calculating (1.018)^6. I might need to use a calculator for that, but since I'm just working this out in my head, maybe I can approximate it or think about the steps. Alternatively, maybe I can remember that each year the amount increases by 1.8%, so it's compounding each year.

Let me break it down step by step for each year to see if that helps.

Year 1: 30000 * 0.018 = 540. So the amount after year 1 is 30000 + 540 = 30540.

Year 2: 30540 * 0.018. Let me compute that. 30540 * 0.018. Hmm, 30000 * 0.018 is 540, and 540 * 0.018 is about 9.72, so total would be 540 + 9.72 = 549.72. So the amount after year 2 is 30540 + 549.72 = 31089.72.

Wait, but that seems a bit tedious to do for each of the six years. Maybe I should just compute 1.018^6 once and then multiply by 30000.

I think the formula approach is better. So let me compute 1.018^6. Let's see, using exponents step by step.

1.018^1 is 1.018.

1.018^2 is 1.018 * 1.018. Let me compute that. 1.018 times 1.018. Let's do 1 * 1.018 is 1.018, 0.018 * 1.018 is 0.018324, so adding them gives 1.036324.

1.018^3 is 1.036324 * 1.018. Let me compute that. 1.036324 * 1.018. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact number, but maybe I can approximate each step.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the rule of 72 or some other method, but I think it's better to just calculate it accurately.

Wait, perhaps I can use logarithms or natural exponents, but that's probably more complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula A = P e^(rt), but that's for continuous compounding, which isn't the case here. So that's not applicable. So back to the original formula.

Alternatively, maybe I can use a binomial expansion for (1.018)^6, but that might take too long. Alternatively, perhaps I can just compute each step as I did before.

Wait, let me think differently. I'll calculate 1.018^6 step by step.

1.018^1 = 1.018

1.018^2 = 1.018 * 1.018 = 1.036324

1.018^3 = 1.036324 * 1.018. Let me compute that.

1.036324 * 1.018:

Let's compute 1.036324 * 1 = 1.036324

1.036324 * 0.018 = 0.018652. So total is 1.036324 + 0.018652 = 1.054976.

1.018^3 ≈ 1.054976

1.018^4 = 1.054976 * 1.018.

1.054976 * 1 = 1.054976

1.054976 * 0.018 = approx 0.018983. So total is 1.054976 + 0.018983 ≈ 1.073959.

1.018^4 ≈ 1.073959

1.018^5 = 1.073959 * 1.018.

1.073959 * 1 = 1.073959

1.073959 * 0.018 = approx 0.019331. So total is 1.073959 + 0.019331 ≈ 1.09329.

1.018^5 ≈ 1.09329

1.018^6 = 1.09329 * 1.018.

1.09329 * 1 = 1.09329

1.09329 * 0.018 = approx 0.019659. So total is 1.09329 + 0.019659 ≈ 1.112949.

So 1.018^6 ≈ 1.112949.

Wait, let me check that calculation again because it's easy to make a mistake in each step.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator-like approach:

Calculate (1.018)^6:

1.018^2 = 1.036324.

1.018^4 = (1.036324)^2. Let's compute 1.036324 squared.

1.036324 * 1.036324:

Let me compute 1 * 1.036324 = 1.036324

0.036324 * 1.036324.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute 1.036324 * 1.036324:

1.036324 * 1 = 1.036324

1.036324 * 0.036324.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it as (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2, where a=1, b=0.036324.

So that would be 1^2 + 2 * 1 * 0.036324 + (0.036324)^2 = 1 + 0.072648 + 0.00132 ≈ 1.073968.

So 1.036324^2 ≈ 1.073968, which is 1.018^4.

Then, 1.018^6 is (1.018^4) * (1.018^2) = 1.073968 * 1.036324.

Let me compute that.

1.073968 * 1.036324.

Multiply step by step:

1.073968 * 1 = 1.073968

1.073968 * 0.036324.

Let me compute 1 * 0.036324 = 0.036324

0.073968 * 0.036324. Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 1.073968 * 0.036324.

Wait, perhaps I can approximate it:

1.073968 * 0.036324 ≈ 1.074 * 0.0363 ≈ let's see, 1 * 0.0363 is 0.0363, 0.074 * 0.0363 is approx 0.002687. So total is about 0.0363 + 0.002687 = 0.038987.

So 1.073968 * 0.036324 ≈ 0.038987.

So adding that to 1.073968 gives 1.073968 + 0.038987 ≈ 1.112955.

So 1.018^6 ≈ 1.112955.

So the amount after 6 years is 30000 * 1.112955.

Let me compute that. 30000 * 1.112955.

Well, 30000 * 1 = 30000.

30000 * 0.112955 = 30000 * 0.1 is 3000, 30000 * 0.012955 is 30000 * 0.01 is 300, 30000 * 0.002955 is 88.65.

So 0.112955 is 0.1 + 0.012955. So 30000 * 0.1 is 3000, 30000 * 0.012955 is 300 + 88.65 = 388.65. So 3000 + 388.65 = 3388.65.

So total amount is 30000 + 3388.65 = 33388.65, approximately.

Wait, let me double-check that multiplication.

Alternatively, 30000 * 1.112955 = 30000 * 1.112955.

Let me compute 30000 * 1.112955.

1.112955 * 3 = 3.338865. Then, since it's 30,000, that's 3.338865 * 10,000, which is 33,388.65.

So the amount after 6 years is approximately $33,388.65.

Looking at the options provided:

Option H is $33,389.35, which is very close to my calculation. So I think H is the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the exponentiation steps. Another approach is to use logarithms or perhaps a more accurate calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula and compute each year's amount step by step, as I did earlier, to see if I get a similar result.

Wait, let me try that.

Year 0: $30,000.

Year 1: 30,000 * 1.018 = 30,000 + (30,000 * 0.018) = 30,000 + 540 = $30,540.

Year 2: 30,540 * 1.018.

Compute 30,540 * 0.018: 30,540 * 0.01 = 305.4; 30,540 * 0.008 = 244.32. So total interest is 305.4 + 244.32 = 549.72. So amount is 30,540 + 549.72 = $31,089.72.

Year 3: 31,089.72 * 1.018.

Compute interest: 31,089.72 * 0.018. Let's compute 31,089.72 * 0.01 = 310.8972; 31,089.72 * 0.008 = 248.71776. So total interest is 310.8972 + 248.71776 ≈ 559.61496. So amount is 31,089.72 + 559.61496 ≈ $31,649.33496.

Wait, no, that can't be right because 31,089.72 * 1.018 should be about 31,089.72 + 559.61 ≈ 31,649.33.

Wait, but earlier when I used the formula, I had 1.018^3 as approximately 1.054976, so 30,000 * 1.054976 is 30,000 + 3,000 * 0.054976? Wait, 30,000 * 0.054976 is 1,649.28, so total would be 31,649.28. Which matches the step-by-step calculation. So that's correct.

Year 4: 31,649.33 * 1.018.

Compute interest: 31,649.33 * 0.018.

Let me compute 31,649.33 * 0.01 = 316.4933; 31,649.33 * 0.008 = 253.19464. So total interest is 316.4933 + 253.19464 ≈ 569.68794. So amount is 31,649.33 + 569.68794 ≈ 32,219.02.

Wait, but according to the formula approach, 1.018^4 is about 1.073959, so 30,000 * 1.073959 is 32,218.77, which is very close to the step-by-step result of $32,219.02. So that's correct.

Year 5: 32,219.02 * 1.018.

Interest: 32,219.02 * 0.018.

Compute 32,219.02 * 0.01 = 322.1902; 32,219.02 * 0.008 = 257.75216. Total interest ≈ 322.1902 + 257.75216 ≈ 579.94236. So amount is 32,219.02 + 579.94236 ≈ 32,799. (Approx 32,798.96).

Wait, according to the formula, 1.018^5 is 1.09329, so 30,000 * 1.09329 = 32,798.70, which matches the step-by-step result of approximately $32,798.96. So that's correct.

Year 6: 32,798.96 * 1.018.

Compute interest: 32,798.96 * 0.018.

32,798.96 * 0.01 = 327.9896; 32,798.96 * 0.008 = 262.39168. So total interest ≈ 327.9896 + 262.39168 ≈ 590.38128. So amount is 32,798.96 + 590.38128 ≈ 33,389.34.

So according to the step-by-step calculation, after 6 years, the amount is approximately $33,389.34, which aligns with the formula approach I did earlier. So looking at the options, option H is $33,389.35, which is almost exactly what I got. So the correct answer must be H.
</think>

To calculate the amount of money in the account after 6 years with annual compounding interest, we use the formula for compound interest:

\[
A = P(1 + r)^n
\]

Where:
- \( P = 30,000 \) (principal amount),
- \( r = 0.018 \) (annual interest rate),
- \( n = 6 \) (number of years).

First, calculate \( (1 + r)^n \), which is \( (1.018)^6 \). Breaking this down:

\[
(1.018)^2 = 1.036324, \quad (1.018)^4 = (1.036324)^2 \approx 1.073959, \quad (1.018)^6 = (1.073959)(1.036324) \approx 1.112955.
\]

Thus, \( (1.018)^6 \approx 1.112955 \).

Now, multiply this by the principal amount:

\[
A = 30,000 \times 1.112955 = 33,388.65.
\]

To verify, we can compute the amount year by year:

- **Year 1**: \( 30,000 \times 1.018 = 30,540 \),
- **Year 2**: \( 30,540 \times 1.018 = 31,089.72 \),
- **Year 3**: \( 31,089.72 \times 1.018 = 31,649.33 \),
- **Year 4**: \( 31,649.33 \times 1.018 = 32,219.02 \),
- **Year 5**: \( 32,219.02 \times 1.018 = 32,798.96 \),
- **Year 6**: \( 32,798.96 \times 1.018 = 33,389.34 \).

Both methods yield approximately \( 33,389.34 \), which matches option **H** (\( 33,389.35 \)).

**Answer: H**
