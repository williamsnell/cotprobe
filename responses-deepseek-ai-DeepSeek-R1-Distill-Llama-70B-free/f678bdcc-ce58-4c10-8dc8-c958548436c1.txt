Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve. It's about finding the speed of sound in steel rails. Hmm, I remember that the speed of sound in a solid depends on the material's properties, like Young's modulus and density. But wait, I need to get the formula right.

I think the formula for the speed of sound in a solid is v = sqrt(Y / ρ), where Y is Young's modulus and ρ is the density. Oh wait, but I should make sure about the units here because the given values are in different units.

Let me note down the given data. The weight density of steel is 490 lb/ft³. Wait, weight density is different from mass density. Oh right, weight density is mass density times gravity. So I might need to convert that to mass density. Or wait, does the formula use mass density or weight density? Because in some contexts, especially in imperial units, people might use weight (which is a force) divided by volume, which is lb/ft³. But in the formula for wave speed, we usually use mass density, which is in slugs/ft³.

So, I need to convert the weight density to mass density. Because Young's modulus is given in lb/in², which is a unit of pressure, so force per area.

Right, the formula uses mass density, so I have to find ρ in slugs per cubic foot. Weight density is γ = 490 lb/ft³. Since weight W = mass m * g, and γ = W/Volume = m g / V. So γ = ρ * g, where ρ is mass density. So to get ρ, I divide γ by g.

What's g in ft/s²? I think it's 32.2 ft/s². So ρ = γ / g = 490 lb/ft³ / 32.2 ft/s². Let me compute that. 490 divided by 32.2. Hmm, 32.2 * 15 is 483, so 15.2 approximately? Let me compute 490 ÷32.2.

Wait, 32.2 * 15 = 483, so 490 - 483 is 7. So 7/32.2 is about 0.217. So 15.217, approximately 15.22 slugs/ft³. So ρ ≈ 15.22 slugs/ft³.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check that. So 490 divided by 32.2. Let me compute 32.2 times 15. Let me do 32 *15=480, plus 0.2*15=3, so 483. So 15 gives 483. Then, 490 is 7 more. So 7/32.2 is approximately 0.217. So yes, 15.217, so approximately 15.22 slugs/ft³.

Next, Young's modulus Y is 29e6 lb/in². But I need to convert this to lb/ft² because our density is in ft³. Because the units for Y should be in lb per square foot, not square inch.

Wait, 1 foot is 12 inches, so 1 square foot is 144 square inches. So 1 lb/in² is 144 lb/ft². Therefore, Y in lb/ft² is 29e6 * 144. Let me calculate that.

29,000,000 * 144. Let's see: 29e6 * 100 is 2.9e9, 29e6 *44 is 1,276e6, so total 4.176e9 lb/ft²? Wait, wait: 29e6 *144 = 29e6 * (100 + 44) = 29e6 *100= 2.9e9, 29e6 *44= 1.276e9. So total 2.9e9 + 1.276e9 = 4.176e9 lb/ft². So Y = 4.176e9 lb/ft².

Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, 29e6 lb/in² * (144 in²/ft²) = 29e6 *144 lb/ft². 29 * 144 is 4176, so 29e6 *144 = 4.176e9 lb/ft². Right.

Now, the formula for speed is v = sqrt(Y / ρ). So plugging in the numbers, Y is 4.176e9, ρ is 15.22.

Compute Y/ρ: 4.176e9 / 15.22 ≈ let's see. 4.176e9 is 4,176,000,000. Divided by 15.22.

Wait, 15.22 times 274,000,000 is approx 4.176e9? Let me compute 15.22 * 274e6.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 4.176e9 / 15.22.

Let me write it as (4.176 /15.22) * 1e9. 

4.176 ÷15.22 ≈ let's compute. 15.22 * 0.274 is about 4.16 (since 0.2*15.22=3.044, 0.07*15.22=1.065, 0.004*15.22=0.0609. Total 3.044+1.065=4.109 +0.0609=4.1699. So 0.274 gives 4.1699, which is very close to 4.176.

So 4.176e9 /15.22 ≈ 0.2743e9 = 2.743e8. So Y/ρ ≈ 2.743e8 (unit is (lb/ft²) / (slug/ft³) )? Wait, let me think about the units.

Wait, Young's modulus Y is in lb/ft², and density ρ is in slugs/ft³. So Y / ρ has units (lb/ft²) / (slug/ft³) ) = (lb * ft³) / (slug * ft²) ) = (lb * ft) / slug.

But slug is a unit of mass. Wait, 1 slug = 1 lb·s²/ft. So substituting that in, (lb * ft) / (slug) ) = (lb * ft) / ( (lb·s²/ft) ) ) = (ft²)/(s²). So the unit is ft²/s², so the square root would be ft/s. Which makes sense.

So the speed is sqrt(2.743e8) ft/s. Let's compute this square root.

What's the square root of 2.743e8? Well, 2.743e8 is 274300000. The square root of 274,300,000.

I know that 16,500^2 is 272,250,000, because 16,000^2=256e6, and 500^2=250,000. So 16,500^2 = (16,000 +500)^2 = 16,000² + 2*16,000*500 +500² = 256e6 + 16e6 + 0.25e6 = 256e6 +16e6 is 272e6, plus 0.25e6 is 272.25e6. So 16,500^2=272.25e6.

Our target is 274.3e6, which is about 2.05e6 higher. Let's see how much more beyond 16,500.

Let me find x such that (16500 + x)^2 = 274.3e6.

(16500 + x)^2 ≈ 16500² + 2*16500*x = 272.25e6 + 33000x.

Set equal to 274.3e6: 272.25e6 + 33000x =274.3e6.

Subtract 272.25e6: 33000x = 2.05e6 → x=2.05e6 /33000 ≈ 62.12.

So x≈62. So the square root is approximately 16500 +62=16562 ft/s.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute 16562^2.

Wait, 16562^2 = (16500 +62)^2 = 16500² + 2*16500*62 +62².

16500² is 272,250,000.

2*16500*62= 2*16500=33000, 33000*62= 33000*60=1,980,000, 33000*2=66,000 → total 2,046,000.

62²=3,844.

So total is 272,250,000 + 2,046,000 = 274,296,000 +3,844 = 274,299,844.

Which is about 274.3 million, which is our Y/rho value. So sqrt(Y/rho) is approximately 16,562 ft/s.

Wait, but let me check the options. The options are all in the 1e4 range. 16,562 is 1.6562e4, which is about 1.66e4. Looking at the options:

A: 1.9e4 →19000

B: 1.2e4 →12000

C: 2e4 →20000

D:1.8e4 →18000

E:1.3e4 →13000

F:1.4e4 →14000

G:2.5e4 →25000

H:2.2e4 →22000

I:1.6e4 →16000

J:2.1e4 →21000.

Hmm, my calculation got approximately 16,562 ft/s, which is 1.656e4. So the closest option is I:1.6e4, which is 16,000. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculations somewhere.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations because the options don't have exactly 1.65e4. Maybe I made a mistake in unit conversion.

Let me go through the steps again.

First, Y is 29e6 lb/in². I converted that to lb/ft² by multiplying by 144. 29e6 *144=4.176e9 lb/ft². That seems correct.

Density: 490 lb/ft³. Since weight density is γ= ρ*g, so ρ=γ/g. g=32.2 ft/s². So ρ=490/32.2=15.217... slugs/ft³. That seems correct.

So Y/rho: 4.176e9 /15.217 → let's compute that more accurately.

4.176e9 /15.217 → 4,176,000,000 /15.217.

Let me compute that division more accurately.

Alternatively, think in terms of exponents.

4.176e9 / 15.217 = (4.176 /15.217) * 1e9.

4.176 /15.217 → Let me compute that.

15.217 * 0.274 = approx 4.16, as I did before. Let me compute 15.217 *0.2743.

Compute 15.217 *0.2 =3.0434.

15.217 *0.07=1.06519.

15.217 *0.0043= approx 0.0655.

Adding these: 3.0434 +1.06519=4.1086 +0.0655≈4.1741.

Which is very close to 4.176, so 0.2743 gives 4.1741. So 4.176 is a bit higher. How much more?

The difference is 4.176 -4.1741=0.0019.

So 15.217 * x =0.0019 → x=0.0019 /15.217 ≈ 0.0001248.

So 0.2743 + 0.0001248 ≈0.274425.

So 4.176e9 /15.217e0 ≈0.274425e9 → 2.74425e8.

So the value inside the square root is 2.74425e8. Now, sqrt(2.74425e8) = sqrt(2.74425)*1e4.

Wait, because 1e8 is (1e4)^2. So sqrt(2.74425e8) = sqrt(2.74425)*1e4.

What's sqrt(2.74425)? Let me calculate.

I know that 1.6^2=2.56, 1.65^2=2.7225, 1.66^2= (1.6 +0.06)^2 =1.6^2 + 2*(1.6)(0.06) +0.06^2 →2.56 +0.192 +0.0036=2.7556.

Wait, 1.66^2 is 2.7556. But we have 2.74425 which is less than that. So between 1.65 and 1.66.

Compute 1.655^2: 1.65^2=2.7225, 0.005^2=0.000025, 2*(1.65)(0.005)=0.0165. So 2.7225 +0.0165 +0.000025=2.739025.

Which is still less than 2.74425.

Next, 1.657^2: let's calculate.

1.657 *1.657: 1.6 *1.6=2.56, 1.6 *0.057=0.0912, 0.057 *1.6=0.0912, 0.057^2=0.003249.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab +b², where a=1.65, b=0.007.

So (1.65 +0.007)^2 = 1.65² + 2*(1.65)(0.007) +0.007².

1.65²=2.7225.

2*(1.65)(0.007)=0.0231.

0.007²=0.000049.

So total is 2.7225 +0.0231=2.7456 +0.000049=2.745649.

Which is 2.7456, which is higher than our target of 2.74425. So we're looking for a number between 1.655 and 1.657.

We have:

At 1.655: 2.739025.

At 1.656: Let's compute 1.656^2.

1.656 *1.656.

Compute 1.65 *1.65 =2.7225.

1.65 *0.006 *2=0.0198.

0.006^2=0.000036.

So 2.7225 +0.0198=2.7423 +0.000036=2.742336.

Wait, that's 1.656^2=2.742336.

But our target is 2.74425.

So 1.656^2=2.742336, 1.657^2=2.745649.

So the difference between 2.742336 and 2.74425 is 1.914.

The interval between 1.656 and 1.657 is 0.001, and the difference in squares is 2.745649 -2.742336=0.003313.

We need to cover 1.914 of that 3.313 over 0.001 increment. So 1.914 /3.313 ≈0.578 of 0.001, so about 0.000578.

So 1.656 + 0.000578≈1.656578.

So sqrt(2.74425) ≈1.65658.

So the speed is approximately 1.65658e4 ft/s, which is 16,565.8 ft/s.

Looking at the options, the closest is I:1.6e4 (16,000) or H:2.2e4 (22,000). Wait, no. Wait, 16,565 is approximately 1.6565e4, which is about 1.66e4. Let me check the options again.

Looking back, option I is 1.6e4 →16,000. Option C is 2e4→20,000. Option D is 1.8e4→18,000. Option A is 1.9e4→19,000. Hmm, none of the options exactly match 1.656e4. Wait, perhaps I made an error in calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in Y's unit conversion. Let me check again.

Y is given as 29e6 lb/in². To convert to lb/ft², since 1 ft² =144 in², so 1 lb/in² = 144 lb/ft². So 29e6 lb/in² = 29e6 *144 lb/ft².

29e6 *144: Let me compute 29 *144.

29 *100=2900,

29*40=1160,

29*4=116.

So 2900 +1160=4060 +116=4176.

So 29e6 *144 =4176e6 lb/ft². Which is 4.176e9 lb/ft², which matches my earlier calculation.

Density: 490 lb/ft³. To get slugs, 490 /32.2=approx15.217 slugs/ft³. Correct.

So Y/rho=4.176e9 /15.217≈2.744e8.

Wait, I think I did everything correctly. So the speed is approximately 1.656e4 ft/s, which is 16,560 ft/s.

Looking at the options, the closest one is I:1.6e4 (16,000) or perhaps H:2.2e4? No, that's 22,000. Wait, no, 16,560 is closer to 1.6e4 than to 1.7e4. But wait, 16,500 is 1.65e4, which would be between options I (1.6e4) and C (2e4), but none of the options have 1.65e4. So perhaps the intended answer is option I:1.6
