Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me about third-party movements in politics. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's see what the question says.

The question is asking what best describes the fate of most popular third-party movements. The options are A through D. I remember that third parties in the U.S. have had some impact but usually don't last long as major players. 

Option A says they displace one of the two major parties and become major themselves. I think that's rare. Like, I know the Republican party started as a third party and replaced the Whigs, but that's an exception, not the usual case. Most third parties don't take over.

Option B claims they're abandoned because their politics are too radical. Maybe that's possible, but I'm not sure if that's the main reason. People might support them initially because they're seen as alternatives, but radical ideas might not sustain long-term support. But is that the primary fate?

Option C says their supporters get frustrated and withdraw from politics. I've heard that people might feel disillusioned if the third party doesn't win, but do they completely withdraw? I think some might, but not sure if that's the most common outcome.

Option D states they disintegrate when major parties adopt their goals. This rings a bell. I remember learning that third parties often push certain issues, and once the main parties (like Democrats or Republicans) take up those issues, the third party's reason for being fades away. So their supporters might feel their issues are being addressed and move back to the major parties. That makes sense because without a unique platform, the third party loses its base.

Wait, so putting it all together: Third parties usually don't take over (so A is unlikely). They might not always be seen as too radical (B), and while some supporters get frustrated (C), the more common scenario is that the major parties co-opt their ideas, leading the third party to lose steam. So D seems correct.

I think that's the right approach. Third parties often influence policy by pushing issues that the majors then adopt, causing the third party to lose relevance.

The correct answer is D. Most popular third-party movements tend to disintegrate when one or both of the major parties adopt their goals, as the third party's unique platform diminishes, leading to a loss of support.

Answer: D
