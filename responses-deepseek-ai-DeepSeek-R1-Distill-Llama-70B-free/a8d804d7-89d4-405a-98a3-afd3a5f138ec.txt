Okay, so I've got this question about frequency modulation, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Part (a) says the carrier frequency is 100 MHz, and the signal is fluctuating at a rate of 100 times per second between 100.001 MHz and 99.999 MHz. I need to find f_m, the modulating frequency, and calculate Δf, the frequency deviation.

Wait, the fluctuation rate is 100 times per second. Oh right, that's the modulating frequency. So f_m should be 100 Hz because frequency is in Hz, which is cycles per second. So that's the first part.

Now for the frequency deviation Δf. The carrier is deviating from 100 MHz. When it goes up, it's 100.001 MHz, which is 1000 Hz higher because 0.001 MHz is 1000 Hz. Similarly, when it goes down, it's 100 MHz minus 0.001 MHz, so that's 1000 Hz lower. So the total deviation from the carrier is 1000 Hz each way. So Δf is 1000 Hz, which is 1 kHz.

Wait, but wait. The question says the fluctuation is between 100.001 and 99.999. So the maximum deviation is 0.001 MHz above and below. So the total swing is 0.002 MHz, but wait, no. Wait, the maximum deviation is the difference from the carrier. So 100.001 - 100 = 0.001, and 100 - 99.999 is 0.001. So the deviation is 0.001 MHz each way, which is 1000 Hz. So that's 1 kHz. So Δf is 1 kHz for part (a). So part (a) gives us f_m = 100 Hz, Δf1 = 1 kHz.

Moving to part (b), the frequency swing is now between 100.002 MHz and 99.998 MHz. So the new deviation is 0.002 MHz above and below. So each way is 0.002 MHz, which is 2000 Hz or 2 kHz. So the new Δf2 is 2 kHz. So the frequency deviation has increased to 2 kHz.

Wait, but the question says, "state if there is any effect." Hmm, probably because with the same modulating frequency, but a larger deviation. So the modulation index β would change, which we'll get to in part (c).

Now part (c), determine the modulation index β in each case.

The modulation index β is given by the formula β = Δf / f_m.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Let me think. In frequency modulation, the modulation index is β = (Δf) / (f_m). Or is it Δf divided by the modulating frequency?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me make sure. Oh, right, in FM, the modulation index is β = (Δf)/(f_m), where Δf is the maximum frequency deviation, and f_m is the modulating frequency.

So for part (a), Δf is 1 kHz, which is 1000 Hz. f_m is 100 Hz. So β1 = 1000 / 100 = 10.

In part (b), Δf is 2 kHz, which is 2000 Hz. So β2 = 2000 / 100 = 20.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me see which one matches this.

Looking at the options:

Option C says f_m=100Hz, Δf1=1kHz, Δf2=3kHz. No, because part (b) is 2kHz, so that can't be.

Option A: f_m=100Hz, Δf1=2kHz? No, because in our case Δf1 is 1kHz, so no.

Option B: f_m=50Hz, which doesn't match our f_m.

Option E: f_m=200Hz. No.

Option G: Δf1=3kHz, which is higher than our case. So no.

Option H: Δf1 is 4kHz.

Wait, looking again, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check.

Wait, in part (a), the deviation is 1000 Hz, which is 1 kHz. So for (a), Δf1 is 1 kHz.

In part (b), the deviation is 2000 Hz, so 2 kHz. So Δf2 is 2 kHz.

So the options should have f_m=100, Δf1=1 kHz, Δf2=2 kHz.

Looking at the options again:

Option C: f_m=100Hz, Δf1=1kHz, Δf2=3kHz. No, because the second is 2, not 3.

Option E: Δf1=1kHz, Δf2=2kHz. Yes, that matches.

Wait, but looking at option E: f_m=200Hz. Oh wait, no, option E says f_m=200Hz, which doesn't match our f_m of 100Hz. So that's not the one.

Wait, let me recheck the options.

Option C: f_m=100, Δf1=1kHz, Δf2=3kHz. Hmm, part (b) Δf is 2kHz, so this doesn't match.

Option A: f_m=100, Δf1=2kHz. No, in part (a), Δf was 1kHz.

Option B: f_m=50. No.

Option D: f_m=150. No.

Option F: f_m=125. No.

Option G: Δf1=3kHz. No.

Option H: Δf1=4kHz. No.

Option I: f_m=75. No.

Option J: f_m=200. No.

Wait, maybe I'm missing an option. Let me check again.

Looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in the Δf for part (b). Let me think again. The frequencies are 100.002 and 99.998. So the deviation is 0.002 MHz each way, which is 2000 Hz each way. So the total deviation is 2000 Hz, so Δf2 is 2000 Hz, which is 2 kHz. So part (b) has Δf2=2 kHz.

So the options must have f_m=100Hz, Δf1=1 kHz, Δf2=2 kHz.

Looking again at the options, none seem to fit. Wait, let me look again.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the options. Let me list each option's parameters.

Option A: f_m=100Hz, Δf1=2kHz, Δf2=4kHz. No, because part (a) Δf is 1kHz.

Option B: f_m=50Hz. No.

Option C: f_m=100, Δf1=1kHz, Δf2=3kHz. No, part (b) Δf is 2kHz.

Option D: f_m=150. No.

Option E: f_m=200, Δf1=1, Δf2=2. No, because f_m is 100.

Option F: f_m=125. No.

Option G: f_m=100, Δf1=3, Δf2=6. No.

Option H: f_m=50. No.

Option I: f_m=75. No.

Option J: f_m=200. No.

Wait, so none of the options seem to match what I have. Because I have f_m=100, Δf1=1kHz, Δf2=2kHz, β1=10, β2=20.

Looking at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating β. Let me think again.

Wait, in some references, the modulation index is defined as β = 2Δf / f_m. Wait, no, that's for amplitude modulation. In FM, it's Δf divided by f_m.

Wait, double-checking: Modulation index in FM is β = (Δf) / (f_m). So for part (a), 1000 Hz / 100 Hz = 10. Part (b): 2000/100=20.

So the β values should be 10 and 20.

Looking again at the options, let's see which option has f_m=100, Δf1=1kHz, Δf2=2kHz, β1=10, β2=20.

Looking through each option:

Option A: β1=20, β2=40. No.

Option B: β1=20, β2=40. No.

Option C: β1=10, β2=30. No, because part (b) β should be 20.

Option D: β1=15, β2=30. No.

Option E: β1=10, β2=20. Yes! Oh wait, but option E has f_m=200Hz. So that's not matching.

Wait, so option E's f_m is 200, which doesn't match our f_m=100.

Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me check the initial question again.

In part (a), the fluctuation rate is 100 times per second. So f_m is 100 Hz. Δf is 0.001 MHz, which is 1000 Hz or 1 kHz.

So part (a) has Δf1=1 kHz, f_m=100 Hz, so β1=10.

Part (b) Δf2=0.002 MHz=2000 Hz=2 kHz, so β2=20.

Looking for an option where f_m=100, Δf1=1, Δf2=2, β1=10, β2=20.

Looking at the options again, perhaps option C?

Option C: f_m=100Hz, Δf1=1kHz, Δf2=3kHz. No, because part (b) Δf is 2kHz. So option C's Δf2 is 3kHz, which doesn't fit.

Option G: f_m=100, Δf1=3kHz. No, because part (a) has 1kHz.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the deviation. The deviation is the total swing, but wait, sometimes in FM, the maximum deviation is given as the peak, so perhaps in part (a), the deviation is 1 kHz, so the swing is 2 kHz. No, wait, no, because the question says between 100.001 and 99.999, which are symmetric around 100. So the deviation is 0.001 MHz above and below, so the total maximum deviation is 0.001 MHz, which is 1 kHz.

So the Δf in part (a) is 1 kHz, and part (b) is 2 kHz.

So looking for an option with f_m=100, Δf1=1, Δf2=2, β1=10, β2=20.

Looking at the options, I don't see any that fit exactly. Wait, perhaps option C is the closest, but its Δf2 is 3.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in part (b). Let me recheck.

In part (b), the frequencies are 100.002 and 99.998. So the deviation from 100 is 0.002 MHz each way. So 0.002 MHz is 2000 Hz, which is 2 kHz. So Δf2 is 2 kHz.

So the correct β values are 10 and 20.

Looking again, the only option with β1=10 and β2=20 is option E, but its f_m is 200. So that's not matching.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the modulating frequency.

Wait, the fluctuation rate is 100 per second. So f_m is 100 Hz. So that hasn't changed.

So perhaps the correct option isn't listed, but that can't be. Alternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating the deviation.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, the deviation is the total swing, not the peak. So in part (a), the total swing is 0.002 MHz (from 99.999 to 100.001), which is 2000 Hz. So perhaps Δf is that, but that would make Δf in part (a) 2 kHz, which is 0.002 MHz.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the peak deviation is 0.001 each way. So maybe the question is considering the total deviation as the peak.

Wait, perhaps I should clarify.

In FM, the frequency deviation Δf is the maximum change in the carrier frequency from its unmodulated value. So when the carrier goes to 100.001, that's +1000 Hz deviation, and to 99.999, that's -1000 Hz. So the maximum deviation is 1000 Hz, which is 1 kHz.

So part (a) Δf is 1 kHz, part (b) Δf is 2 kHz.

Thus, the correct β values are 10 and 20.

Looking again at the options, perhaps none of them exactly match. But let me go through all options once more.

Option E: f_m=200Hz. No, but our f_m is 100.

Wait, maybe I messed up the modulation index. Alternatively, perhaps I confused β being Δf divided by f_m.

Wait, let's check another way. Maybe the modulation index is defined differently. Oh wait, no, in FM, it's β = Δf / f_m.

So if f_m is 100 Hz, and Δf is 1 kHz (1000 Hz), β is 10. If Δf is 2 kHz, β is 20.

So looking for an option where f_m=100, Δf1=1, Δf2=2, β1=10, β2=20.

Looking again, none of the options match this.

Wait, but perhaps I've made a mistake. Let me look at option C again.

Option C: f_m=100, Δf1=1kHz, Δf2=3kHz, β1=10, β2=30.

Hmm, in part (b), Δf2 is 2 kHz, so option C's Δf2 is 3, which doesn't fit.

Option G: f_m=100, Δf1=3kHz, Δf2=6kHz, β1=30, β2=60.

No, that's higher than our case.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me see which option has f_m=100, Δf1=1, Δf2=2, β1=10, β2=20. But none of the options seem to have this.

Wait, looking again at the options, perhaps option C is the intended one, but the Δf2 is 3. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended Δf as the total swing, so part (a) Δf is 2 kHz, making β=20.

Wait, that would change things. Let me reevaluate.

If in part (a), the total swing is 2000 Hz (from 99.999 to 100.001), then Δf is 2000 Hz (2 kHz). Then β would be 2 kHz / 100 Hz = 20.

In part (b), the total swing is 4 kHz, so β is 40.

Looking at the options, option A has f_m=100, Δf1=2kHz, Δf2=4kHz, β1=20, β2=40.

But earlier I thought Δf is the peak, not the total swing. So which is correct?

Wait, according to standard FM definitions, the frequency deviation Δf is the maximum change in frequency from the carrier. So if the carrier swings from +Δf to -Δf, the total swing is 2Δf, but the deviation is Δf each way.

So in part (a), Δf is 1 kHz, as each swing is 1 kHz from the center. So the correct answer would be β1=10, β2=20.

But since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option C, but with Δf2=3kHz, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended the total swing as Δf.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in part (b). Let me recalculate.

Part (b) frequencies: 100.002 and 99.998.

100.002 - 100 = 0.002 MHz = 2000 Hz = 2 kHz. So Δf2 is 2 kHz.

So with f_m=100, Δf1=1, Δf2=2, β1=10, β2=20.

Looking again at the options, perhaps option C has f_m=100, but Δf2=3, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating f_m.

Wait, the fluctuation rate is 100 times per second. So f_m=100 Hz.

Looking again at the options, perhaps option C is intended, but with a mistake in Δf2.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is not present. But that can't be.

Wait, looking at option C again: part (a) Δf1=1 kHz, part (b) Δf2=3 kHz. How would that happen?

Wait, in part (b), if the frequency swing is 100.002 and 99.998, that's a total swing of 4 kHz. Wait, 100.002 - 99.998 = 0.004 MHz, which is 4 kHz. But the deviation from the center is 0.002 each way, so 2 kHz.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering Δf as the total swing, not the peak. So in part (a), the total swing is 0.002 MHz (2000 Hz), so Δf=2 kHz. Then part (b), the total swing is 0.004 MHz (4 kHz), so Δf=4 kHz.

In that case, part (a) Δf=2 kHz, β=2 kHz / 100 Hz = 20.

Part (b) Δf=4 kHz, β=40.

Looking at the options, option A matches this.

Option A: f_m=100Hz, Δf1=2kHz, Δf2=4kHz, β1=20, β2=40.

So perhaps the question is considering Δf as the total frequency swing, not the peak deviation. So if that's the case, option A is correct.

But according to standard definitions, frequency deviation Δf is the peak, not the total. But perhaps the question is using a different convention.

So in this case, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

But I'm a bit confused now. Because in FM, the deviation is the maximum change, so
