Okay, let's tackle this networking question. Hmm, so the question is about IP datagrams traveling through routers and how many interfaces and forwarding tables are involved. I remember that each router uses a forwarding table to decide where to send the packet next.

Wait, the setup says there are three routers between the source and destination. So the path would be source -> R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> destination. That makes sense. 

Now, each time the datagram passes through a router, it's going through two interfaces: one incoming and one outgoing. So for each router, that's two interfaces. But wait, actually, when the datagram arrives at the source host, it's sent out through one interface to the first router. Then each router in between uses two interfaces each. But the destination host receives it through one interface from the last router.

Let me think more clearly. Let's model the journey step by step.

1. Source host sends the datagram out of its interface to R1.
2. R1 receives it on one interface (input), looks up its forwarding table, and sends it out another interface to R2.
3. R2 does the same: receives, consults table, sends to R3.
4. R3 receives, consults table, sends to destination host.

So each router adds two interfaces: one in, one out. But wait, how many interfaces does the datagram pass through in total?

The source's interface is 1. Then R1 has two (in and out), R2 two, R3 two. Then the destination's interface is 1. Wait, no, the destination is a host, so it's just one interface receiving. So in total: 1 (source) + 2*3 (routers) + 1 (destination) = 1+6+1=8 interfaces? Or wait, perhaps I'm overcounting.

Wait, each router is connected by two links. For each router, the datagram enters via one interface and exits via another. So for each router, the datagram uses two interfaces. But the source starts by sending it through one interface, and the destination receives it through one.

Wait, no. The source's interface is 1. Then each router has two interfaces used. So 3 routers * 2 =6. Then the destination's interface is 1. So total 1+6+1=8? So the number of interfaces traversed is 8.

But wait, another way: the number of links is 4. Because source to R1 is one link, R1-R2 another, R2-R3, R3-destination. So four links, each link has two interfaces (each end). So the datagram travels through each link once, using two interfaces per link. Wait, no. Each link is between two devices, but the datagram goes through each link once. So for each link, it's two interfaces (one on each end). So four links mean 4*2=8 interfaces.

Yes, that makes sense. So the first part is 8 interfaces.

Now, the second part: how many forwarding tables are indexed? Each time the datagram arrives at a router, it consults the forwarding table. So the source is a host, not a router, so no table lookup. The destination is a host, same.

So the datagram passes through R1, R2, R3. Each of these routers will look up their forwarding tables once. So that's 3 lookups, meaning 3 tables are indexed.

Wait, but wait. The source is a host, so when it sends the datagram, does it consult a forwarding table? I think so. Hosts have routing tables as well, but in this context, the question is about routers. So the source host's routing table is used to decide where to send the packet, but the question is about the routers in between.

So the forwarding tables are only at the routers. So the datagram starts at the source, goes to R1. R1's table is used. Then R2's, then R3's. So three tables.

But wait, another angle: the source's routing table is used to send it to R1. So does that count as a table lookup? The question says "forwarding tables" which I think refers to routers. Hosts don't have forwarding tables in the same sense; they have routing tables which are typically smaller and used to find the next hop.

Wait, but the question states, "how many forwarding tables will be indexed to move the datagram from the source to the destination." So the source is the source host. When the host sends the datagram, it looks up its routing table to decide where to send it. So that's one table. Then each router along the way looks up their own forwarding tables. So in that case, the count is 1 (source) + 3 routers = 4 tables.

Ah, I think that's it. Because the question includes the source as part of the journey. So the source's routing table is considered, even though it's a host. So the total tables indexed are four.

So the answer would be 8 interfaces and 4 tables, which is option E: [7,4]? Wait, no. Looking back at the options:

Options:

A: [6,3]

B: [9,4]

C: [8,4]

D: [10,5]

E: [7,4]

F: [8,3]

G: [9,5]

H: [4,2]

I: [5,3]

J: [12,6]

Wait, earlier I thought interfaces are 8 and tables are 4. So the option is C: [8,4].

Wait, but let me double-check. The datagram starts at source host, which sends it to R1. So the source's routing table is used (1). Then R1, R2, R3 each use their forwarding tables (3). So total tables is 4.

So the count is [8,4], which is option C.

To determine how many interfaces and forwarding tables an IP datagram passes through when traveling from a source host to a destination host via three routers, we analyze the journey step by step:

1. **Interfaces**:  
   - The datagram starts at the source host and is sent through one interface to the first router (R1).  
   - Each router (R1, R2, R3) processes the datagram, using two interfaces: one to receive the datagram and another to forward it.  
   - Finally, the datagram arrives at the destination host through one interface.  
   - Total interfaces = 1 (source) + 2 Ã— 3 (routers) + 1 (destination) = **8 interfaces**.

2. **Forwarding Tables**:  
   - The source host uses its routing table to determine the next hop (R1), which counts as one table lookup.  
   - Each router (R1, R2, R3) consults its forwarding table to route the datagram.  
   - Total forwarding tables indexed = 1 (source) + 3 (routers) = **4 tables**.

Thus, the datagram travels over **8 interfaces** and indexes **4 forwarding tables**. The correct answer is:

**C: [8, 4]**
