Question:

Margaret Mead suggested that:

Options:

A: cultural norms have no influence on adolescence and gender roles

E: gender roles are universally identical and biologically determined
F: every society has the same adolescence experience
G: adolescence and gender roles varied between societies and so were culturally determined
H: there are no variations in gender roles and adolescence across different cultures
I: adolescence in the USA is a time of relative calm compared to the experience in Japan and Europe
J: adolescence is universally a time of turmoil and confusion

Okay, so I have this question about Margaret Mead and her suggestions. Hmm, I remember she was an anthropologist, right? She did fieldwork in different cultures, especially in the South Pacific. I think she's known for her work on adolescence and gender roles.

The question is asking what Margaret Mead suggested. The options are A to J. Let me think about each option.

Option A says cultural norms have no influence on adolescence and gender roles. That doesn't sound right. I remember Mead arguing that culture does influence these things, so A is probably wrong.

Option B claims that gender roles in three New Guinea societies were identical and thus biologically determined. Wait, Mead actually found differences, not identical roles. So B must be incorrect because she suggested cultural factors, not biological ones.

Option C states that anthropological fieldwork is completely objective and unbiased. I don't think Mead believed that. I recall that fieldwork can be influenced by the researcher's own biases and cultural background. So C is probably wrong.

Option D says fieldwork can be problematic because the researcher's values affect their interpretations. That sounds more accurate. Mead's work was sometimes criticized for her own biases, so D seems like a correct point she might have made.

Option E suggests gender roles are universally identical and biologically determined. No, Mead's work was about variation across cultures, so E is wrong.

Option F says every society has the same adolescence experience. That's the opposite of what I remember. Mead showed that adolescence varies, so F is incorrect.

Option G states that adolescence and gender roles varied between societies and were culturally determined. Yes, this rings a bell. Mead's "Coming of Age in Samoa" showed that Samoan adolescents had a different, less turbulent experience than Western societies, pointing to cultural factors.

Option H claims there are no variations in gender roles and adolescence. That's not true; Mead found variations, so H is wrong.

Option I talks about adolescence in the USA being calm compared to Japan and Europe. I'm not sure about this. I don't recall Mead making this specific comparison, so I might need to think more. But the question is about what she suggested, and I think her main point was about cultural variation, not specific country comparisons.

Option J says adolescence is universally a time of turmoil. Mead actually argued against this, showing that it's not universal. So J is wrong.

So, looking back, the options that fit are G and D. Wait, the question is about what Mead suggested. She's known for her cultural determinism, so G is correct. And D is about the fieldwork issues, which I think she might have acknowledged. But the question is about what she suggested, not her methodology. So the answer is probably G.

Margaret Mead is renowned for her anthropological work, particularly her research on adolescence and gender roles across cultures. Her findings emphasized the influence of cultural factors rather than biological determinism. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, E, F, H, J** are incorrect because they contradict Mead's emphasis on cultural variation and her rejection of universal biological determinism.
- **C** is incorrect as Mead acknowledged the potential for bias in fieldwork.
- **D** is plausible, as Mead's work was sometimes criticized for bias, but the question focuses on her suggestions rather than methodological critiques.
- **G** aligns with Mead's central argument that adolescence and gender roles vary across societies and are culturally determined, as seen in her work "Coming of Age in Samoa."

Thus, the best answer is:

G

Answer: G
