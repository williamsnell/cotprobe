Okay, so I've got this problem here about binary numbers and student IDs. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. Let's see, each student gets a unique ID, which is a binary number. The IDs increase by 1 each time a new student enrolls. The last student's ID was 1001 0011 in binary. I need to find out what the next student's ID will be.

Wait, so binary numbers work just like decimal, but each digit represents a power of 2 instead of 10. So when you add 1 to a binary number, it should increment just like in decimal, carrying over when you hit a 1.

Let me write down the given binary number: 1001 0011. I think the spaces are just for readability, so the actual binary is 10010011. Now, I need to add 1 to this number.

Let me convert this binary to decimal first to make it easier. Maybe that will help me understand what's going on. So, each digit from right to left represents 2^0, 2^1, etc.

So breaking it down:
1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1

Wait, that's 8 digits. Let's index them from right starting at 0:
Position 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
Bit:       1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1

So the values are:
1*(2^7) = 128
0*(2^6)=0
0*(2^5)=0
1*(2^4)=16
0*(2^3)=0
0*(2^2)=0
1*(2^1)=2
1*(2^0)=1

Adding them up: 128 + 16 + 2 + 1 = 147 in decimal. So the last ID was 147.

The next student's ID would be 148. So I need to convert 148 into binary.

Let me do that. 148 divided by 2 repeatedly.

148 /2 =74, remainder 0
74/2=37, rem 0
37/2=18 rem 1
18/2=9 rem 0
9/2=4 rem 1
4/2=2 rem 0
2/2=1 rem 0
1/2=0 rem 1

So writing the remainders from bottom to top: 10010100.

Wait, wait, let me check that. Let me calculate the powers:

128 is 2^7, which is 128. 148-128=20 left.

Next, 64 is 2^6=64. 20 is less than 64, so next is 32 (2^5). 20 is less than 32, so 0 there.

Next, 16 (2^4). 20-16=4, so that's 1.

Then 8 (2^3): 4 is less than 8, so 0.

4 (2^2): 4-4=0, so 1.

2^1: 0, 2^0: 0.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. Let me try another approach. Let's list the powers and see which fit.

128 (2^7) is included because 128 <=148. 148-128=20.

64 (2^6) is bigger than 20, so next.

32 (2^5) is bigger than 20, so no.

16 (2^4) is 16 <=20. 20-16=4. So 16 is included.

8 is 2^3: 4 <8, so no.

4 (2^2) is 4. 4-4=0. So yes.

2^1 is 2: 0 left, so no.

2^0: 0, so no.

Wait, so the binary would be 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0. Wait, let me arrange that correctly. From highest to lowest:

2^7:1, 2^6:0, 2^5:0, 2^4:1, 2^3:0, 2^2:1, 2^1:0, 2^0:0.

So the binary is 10010100.

Wait, but I thought earlier when I did the division method, I got 10010100 as well. So that's correct.

But wait, looking at the options, none of them have 1001 0100 as the correct answer. Wait, let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: 1001 0110

B: 1101 0100

C: 1001 0101

D: 1101 0111

E: 1001 1000

F: 1001 0010

G: 1001 0100

H: 1001 0111

I: 1101 0011

J: 1011 0100

Oh wait, option G is 1001 0100, which is exactly what I got. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in adding 1 to the original binary. Let me try another way: adding 1 in binary without converting to decimal.

Original binary: 1001 0011. Let's write it as 10010011.

Adding 1 to this:

Start from the right. The rightmost bit is 1. Adding 1 would make it 0 and carry over 1.

Next bit to the left is 1 again. Adding the carry, it becomes 0, carry again.

Next is 0. Adding carry, it becomes 1, no carry.

The remaining bits stay the same.

So the process:

10010011
+         1
----------
10010100

Which is 1001 0100, which is option G.

So the correct answer is G.

To determine the binary ID assigned to the next student, we start with the last student's ID, which is given as `1001 0011` in binary. Since IDs increase sequentially by 1, we need to add 1 to this binary number.

### Step 1: Binary Addition
The given binary number is `1001 0011`. Adding 1 to this number:

1. Start from the rightmost bit. The rightmost bit is `1`. Adding 1 makes it `0` with a carryover of 1.
2. Move to the next bit to the left, which is also `1`. Adding the carryover makes it `0` with another carryover of 1.
3. The next bit is `0`. Adding the carryover makes it `1`, and there is no further carryover.
4. The remaining bits remain unchanged.

Thus, the result of `1001 0011 + 1` is `1001 0100`.

### Step 2: Verify the Result
To confirm, we can convert the original binary number `1001 0011` to decimal. Breaking it down:

- `1 * 2^7 = 128`
- `0 * 2^6 = 0`
- `0 * 2^5 = 0`
- `1 * 2^4 = 16`
- `0 * 2^3 = 0`
- `0 * 2^2 = 0`
- `1 * 2^1 = 2`
- `1 * 2^0 = 1`

Adding these values: `128 + 16 + 2 + 1 = 147`. The next ID is `148` in decimal. Converting `148` back to binary:

- `148 / 2 = 74`, remainder `0`
- `74 / 2 = 37`, remainder `0`
- `37 / 2 = 18`, remainder `1`
- `18 / 2 = 9`, remainder `0`
- `9 / 2 = 4`, remainder `1`
- `4 / 2 = 2`, remainder `0`
- `2 / 2 = 1`, remainder `0`
- `1 / 2 = 0`, remainder `1`

Writing the remainders from bottom to top gives `1001 0100`, which matches the result from the binary addition.

### Final Answer
The binary number assigned to the next student is `1001 0100`, which corresponds to **Option G**.
