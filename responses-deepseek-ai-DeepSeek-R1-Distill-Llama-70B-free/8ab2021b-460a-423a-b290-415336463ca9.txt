Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again: Calculate the pH of a 0.25 M solution of ethyl-amine hydrochloride, which is C2H5NH3Cl. They gave me the dissociation constant for the base, ethylamine, K_b = 5.6e-4. And I have to choose the answer from options A to J.

Hmm, right. So ethyl-amine hydrochloride is a salt, right? And salts can affect the pH of a solution based on whether they're acidic, basic, or neutral. Since ethylamine is a base, its conjugate acid would be in the salt. So ethylamine (C2H5NH2) is the base, and the salt is the conjugate acid, which would be C2H5NH3+ Cl^-.

Wait, so when the salt dissolves in water, it dissociates into C2H5NH3+ and Cl^- ions. Now, Cl^- is the conjugate base of a strong acid (HCl), so it doesn't undergo hydrolysis. But the C2H5NH3+ ion is the conjugate acid of a weak base, so it will hydrolyze in water, making the solution acidic. Because the cation comes from a weak base, it should act as a weak acid.

So the pH of the solution will be less than 7, which makes sense because the solution should be acidic. Looking at the options, all the choices below 7 are B, C, D, G, H, I, J. So the answer must be among these.

Now, to calculate the pH, I think I need to find the concentration of H+ ions. Since the salt is the conjugate acid of a weak base, I can use the Kb of the base to find the Ka of the conjugate acid.

The formula I remember is Kw = Ka * Kb, where Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Ka = Kw / Kb. Let me calculate that.

Given Kb = 5.6e-4. So Ka = (1e-14) / (5.6e-4) = approximately 1.7857e-11. Let me double-check that calculation. 1e-14 divided by 5.6e-4 is (1 /5.6) * 1e-10. 1/5.6 is about 0.17857, so 0.17857e-10 is 1.7857e-11. Yeah, that seems right.

Now, the ethylammonium ion (C2H5NH3+) will undergo hydrolysis in water:

C2H5NH3+ + H2O ↔ H3O+ + C2H5NH2

This is a Brønsted acid reaction, so the equilibrium expression is Ka = [H3O+][C2H5NH2] / [C2H5NH3+].

Let me set up an ICE table. The initial concentration of C2H5NH3+ is 0.25 M. The initial concentrations of H3O+ and C2H5NH2 are zero.

Change: Let x be the concentration of H+ produced. So:

C2H5NH3+ : 0.25 - x
H3O+: x
C2H5NH2: x

So the Ka expression becomes:

Ka = (x)(x) / (0.25 - x) ) = (x^2) / (0.25 - x) = 1.7857e-11.

Since Ka is very small, x is going to be much smaller than 0.25, so I can approximate 0.25 - x ≈ 0.25. So the equation simplifies to x^2 ≈ 1.7857e-11 * 0.25.

Calculating the right side: 1.7857e-11 * 0.25 = 4.46425e-12. So x^2 = 4.46425e-12 → x = sqrt(4.46425e-12) ≈ 6.68e-6.

Wait, let me compute that. The square root of 4.464e-12 is sqrt(4.464) * 1e-6. sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(4.464) ≈ 2.11. So x ≈ 2.11e-6.

So [H+] is approximately 2.11e-6 M. Now, pH is -log[H+]. Let me calculate that.

Log(2.11e-6) = log(2.11) + log(1e-6). Log(2.11) is about 0.324. So total is 0.324 -6 = -5.676. So pH is 5.676, approximately 5.68.

Looking at the options, option B is 5.2, D is 5.7, G is 5.6, H is 6.2. Wait, 5.68 is closest to 5.7, which is option D.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the approximation. Because when I ignored x in the denominator, I assumed x is negligible compared to 0.25. Let's check: x is about 2.11e-6, and 0.25 is 0.25 M. So 2.11e-6 is way smaller than 0.25, so the approximation holds.

Alternatively, maybe I should do a more precise calculation without the approximation.

Let me write the exact equation: x² = (1.7857e-11)(0.25 - x). Since x is very small, 0.25 - x ≈ 0.25, so the approximation is valid, but let me think if perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

But given that the x is so small, the approximation is acceptable, and the pH should be approximately 5.68, which is around 5.7. So option D is 5.7.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 5.7, and option G is 5.6. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the square root. Let me re-calculate x.

x² = 4.46425e-12 → x = sqrt(4.46425e-12). Let me compute that more accurately.

What's the square root of 4.46425e-12? Let's compute 4.46425e-12.

Well, 4.46425e-12 is 4.46425 x 10^-12. So sqrt(4.46425) is approximately 2.112, because 2.112^2 = (2 + 0.112)^2 = 4 + 2*2*0.112 + 0.112^2 = 4 + 0.448 + 0.012544 ≈ 4.4605. Close enough. So sqrt(4.46425e-12) is 2.112e-6.

So [H+] = 2.112e-6 → pH = -log(2.112e-6) = 5.674, which is approximately 5.67, so about 5.67, which is close to 5.7.

So the pH should be around 5.67, so the closest option is D:5.7.

Wait, but let me think again. Another approach: sometimes, when dealing with weak acids, if the concentration is not extremely dilute, the approximation is valid. So I think my approach is correct.

So the answer should be D:5.7.

To calculate the pH of a 0.25 M solution of ethyl-amine hydrochloride (C₂H₅NH₃Cl), we first recognize that this salt dissociates into C₂H₅NH₃⁺ and Cl⁻ ions in water. The Cl⁻ ion is inert and does not hydrolyze, but the C₂H₅NH₃⁺ ion, being the conjugate acid of the weak base ethylamine (C₂H₅NH₂), undergoes hydrolysis:

\[
\text{C₂H₅NH₃⁺} + \text{H₂O} \leftrightarrow \text{H₃O⁺} + \text{C₂H₅NH₂}
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the acid dissociation constant \( K_a \), which can be calculated using the relationship \( K_a = \frac{K_w}{K_b} \), where \( K_b = 5.6 \times 10^{-4} \) (given for ethylamine) and \( K_w = 1.0 \times 10^{-14} \) at 25°C:

\[
K_a = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{5.6 \times 10^{-4}} = 1.7857 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

Next, we set up the equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis reaction:

\[
K_a = \frac{[H₃O⁺][C₂H₅NH₂]}{[C₂H₅NH₃⁺]}.
\]

Let the initial concentration of C₂H₅NH₃⁺ be 0.25 M, and let \( x \) represent the concentration of \( \text{H₃O⁺} \) produced at equilibrium. Then, the equilibrium concentrations are:

\[
[\text{C₂H₅NH₃⁺}] = 0.25 - x, \quad [\text{H₃O⁺}] = x, \quad [\text{C₂H₅NH₂}] = x.
\]

Substituting these into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_a = \frac{x^2}{0.25 - x}.
\]

Since \( K_a \) is very small, \( x \) is much smaller than 0.25, so we approximate \( 0.25 - x \approx 0.25 \). The equation simplifies to:

\[
x^2 = K_a \cdot 0.25 = (1.7857 \times 10^{-11})(0.25) = 4.46425 \times 10^{-12}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4.46425 \times 10^{-12}} \approx 2.11 \times 10^{-6}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of \( \text{H₃O⁺} \) is approximately \( 2.11 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M} \). The pH is calculated as:

\[
\text{pH} = -\log[H₃O⁺] = -\log(2.11 \times 10^{-6}) = 5.674.
\]

Rounding to one decimal place, the pH is approximately 5.7. Comparing this to the given options, the closest match is:

**D: 5.7.**
