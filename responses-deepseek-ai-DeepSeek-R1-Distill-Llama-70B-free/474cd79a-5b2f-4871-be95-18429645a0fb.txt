Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about criminal law, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's break it down.

The scenario is about two friends. The young man suggests stealing a TV from a neighbor. The friend gets angry and wants to get even, so he decides to have the young man arrested. The friend agrees to help and drives the young man to the neighbor's house. The young man breaks in while the friend waits outside. Then, the friend calls the police and leaves. The police catch the young man as he's carrying the TV out.

The question is asking what the friend is guilty of in a common law jurisdiction. The options are various crimes like conspiracy, aiding and abetting, accessory, etc.

First, I need to recall the elements of each crime mentioned in the options.

Starting with conspiracy. Conspiracy requires an agreement between two or more people to commit a crime, and in some jurisdictions, an overt act in furtherance of that agreement. Here, the friend agreed to help steal the TV. But wait, the friend's actual intention was to get the young man arrested. So, did the friend really agree to commit the crime, or was he just pretending to go along? If the friend never intended to actually commit the crime, then there's no conspiracy because conspiracy requires a shared intent. So maybe conspiracy isn't the right answer.

Next, aiding and abetting. This involves helping someone else commit a crime, with the intent to facilitate it. The friend drove the young man to the scene and waited outside. That could be seen as aiding the burglary or larceny. So the friend might be guilty of aiding and abetting the burglary or larceny. But I need to think about the specific crimes here.

What about accessory? An accessory usually refers to someone who helps after the crime is committed, like harboring the criminal. But here, the friend's actions were before and during the crime, so maybe accessory isn't the right fit.

Criminal facilitation is a crime where someone provides assistance to another person in committing a crime, knowing that it will help in the commission. This might apply here because the friend drove him there, knowing the plan to steal. But I'm not sure if this is a common law crime or a statutory one. I think common law might not recognize facilitation as a separate offense, so maybe that's not it.

Looking at the specific crimes, burglary at common law typically involves breaking and entering into a dwelling with the intent to commit a felony inside. Here, the young man broke in, so he's guilty of burglary. The friend waited outside, so he didn't commit the burglary himself. But he helped the young man, so he might be guilty of aiding and abetting burglary.

Solicitation is when someone encourages another to commit a crime, with the intent that it be committed. The young man suggested the theft, but the friend didn't encourage it; he agreed to help to set him up. So maybe solicitation isn't the right charge for the friend.

Larceny is the unlawful taking and carrying away of someone else's property. The friend didn't take the TV himself, so he's not guilty of larceny. But he might be an accomplice to it.

So, putting it together, the friend helped the young man commit burglary by driving him there and waiting. He intended to help him commit the crime, even though his ultimate goal was to get him caught. His intent to help the crime is enough for aiding and abetting, regardless of his ulterior motives.

Looking at the options, option H is aiding and abetting. But I should check if there's a specific crime like conspiracy or another.

Wait, conspiracy requires an agreement to commit a crime. If the friend agreed to help steal the TV, but with the intent to betray, does that negate the conspiracy? Because for conspiracy, both parties must have the intent to commit the crime. If the friend never intended to go through with the theft, just to help get the other arrested, then maybe there's no conspiracy. So the friend can't be guilty of conspiracy because his intent wasn't to commit the crime, but to prevent it. Therefore, conspiracy (option A) is out.

So the friend's actions are more about aiding and abetting the burglary. Therefore, the correct charge would be aiding and abetting burglary.

Looking at the options, H is aiding and abetting, but I need to see if any option combines charges. Option E is conspiracy and accessory to burglary, but we've ruled out conspiracy. Option I is accessory to burglary, which might not fit because the friend's role was before the crime, not after.

Therefore, the friend is guilty of aiding and abetting burglary. So the answer should be H.

The friend's actions involved driving the young man to the neighbor's house and waiting outside while the young man committed burglary. The friend's intent was to facilitate the crime, even though his ultimate goal was to have the young man arrested. At common law, conspiracy requires a shared intent to commit the crime, which the friend lacked since his purpose was not to carry out the theft but to betray the young man. Therefore, conspiracy is not applicable.

Aiding and abetting involves assisting in the commission of a crime with the intent to facilitate it. The friend's actions, such as driving the young man to the scene and waiting outside, clearly constitute aiding and abetting the burglary. Other options, such as accessory or criminal facilitation, do not fit as well because the friend's involvement was during the commission of the crime, not after, and criminal facilitation is not typically recognized at common law.

Thus, the friend is guilty of aiding and abetting burglary.

Answer: H
