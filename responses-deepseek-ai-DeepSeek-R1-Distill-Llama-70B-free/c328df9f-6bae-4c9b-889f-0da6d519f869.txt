Okay, so I have this problem about a helical spring, and I need to find the maximum deflection when a load is applied. Hmm, I remember that springs store energy when deformed, and the amount they can deflect depends on their material properties and geometry.

The question gives me a bunch of data. Let me list them out. The spring has square and ground ends, 18 coils. The modulus of elasticity in shear is 12 × 10^6 psi. The load applied is 90 lbs. The outside diameter is 3.8 inches, and the inside diameter is 0.25 inches. I need to find the maximum deflection.

Wait, I think the formula for the deflection of a helical spring under a load involves the shear modulus, the number of coils, wire diameter, and the load. Oh right, the formula is delta equals (W * n * D^3) divided by (G * d), but wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact terms here. Let me think again.

Oh wait, no. The general formula for deflection (δ) of a spring is δ = (8 * W * D^3 * n) / (G * d^4) * something? Or maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me recall the correct formula.

I think the formula is δ = (8 * W * D^3 * n) / (G * d^4) multiplied by some factor because of the ends. Oh wait, square and ground ends might affect the formula. I remember that different end conditions change the formula by a factor. Let me try to remember.

Right, for a spring with square ends, the formula has a factor of 8, and for the ends being ground, it might be a different factor. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Oh wait, I think the formula for deflection when you have a certain type of ends is either δ = (8 W D^3 n)/(G d^4) or multiplied by another factor. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is δ = (64 W R^3 n)/(G d^4), where R is the mean radius. Hmm, not sure about that.

Wait, another approach. The wire diameter is d, and the spring has an outside diameter D and inside diameter d_i. So the mean diameter would be (D + d_i)/2. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the wire diameter, which is the difference between the outside and inside diameters. Oh wait, the wire diameter is actually the diameter of the wire, which is (D - d_i), right? Because the outside diameter is the overall spring's outer edge, and the inside is the inner edge. So the wire's diameter is D - d_i. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. For a spring, the wire diameter is typically d, and the inside diameter is D_in = D_out - 2d, assuming the wire's diameter is d. Wait, maybe I should compute the wire diameter from the given outside and inside diameters.

Wait, the outside diameter is 3.8 inches, and the inside is 0.25 inches. So the difference between the outside and inside is 3.8 - 0.25 = 3.55 inches. But that's the total diameter difference. Since the spring is a coil, the wire's diameter would be the difference divided by 2, right? Because the wire is on both the outside and inside. So the wire diameter d is (3.8 - 0.25)/2 = 3.55 / 2 = 1.775 inches. Wait, that can't be right because the inside diameter is 0.25, which is much smaller than the wire diameter. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong.

Wait, wait, maybe the wire diameter is the difference between the outside and inside diameters. So d = D_out - D_in. So d = 3.8 - 0.25 = 3.55 inches. But that seems too big for a wire diameter. Because normally, the inside diameter is D_in = D_out - 2d, so solving for d: d = (D_out - D_in)/2. Oh, right! Because the wire's diameter reduces the inside diameter by twice the wire's diameter. So in that case, d = (3.8 - 0.25)/2 = 3.55 / 2 = 1.775 inches. Hmm, that seems really big, but maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the terms. Wait, no, that's correct. For example, if the outside diameter is D and the inside is D - 2d, then the wire diameter is d.

So now, I can calculate d as (3.8 - 0.25)/2 = 1.775 inches.

Wait, but that seems like a very thick wire for a spring. But maybe that's correct. Let's proceed.

Now, the modulus of elasticity in shear, G, is given as 12 × 10^6 psi. The load W is 90 lbs. The number of coils n is 18.

So the deflection formula. I think the formula is δ = (8 W D^3 n)/(G d^4) multiplied by a factor based on the end conditions. Wait, I remember that for different end conditions, the formula has a factor. For example, for a spring with both ends squared and ground, the formula is δ = (8 W D^3 n)/(G d^4). But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I've heard of the factor being 8 for one condition and 64 for another. Wait, perhaps the formula is δ = (64 W R^3 n)/(G d^4) when R is the mean radius, but that might be for a different setup.

Wait, maybe I should look up the formula again. Since I can't actually look it up, I'll try to recall. The formula for deflection of a helical spring under axial load is given by δ = (W * n * D^3) / (G * d^4) multiplied by a factor that depends on the end conditions. For example, if the spring has open ends, the factor is 8, but if it's closed and ground, it's 64. Wait, no, that can't be right because 64 is a big factor.

Wait, perhaps it's the other way around. Let me think. For a spring with both ends closed (like with square ends), the factor is 8. But when the ends are open, the factor is different. Alternatively, I think the formula is δ = (8 W D^3 n)/(G d^4) for a spring with closed ends. But I'm not sure. Another approach is to use the formula for a spring with closed and ground ends, which might have a different factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is δ = (W * n * (D^4)) / (something) but I'm getting confused.

Wait, another thought. The formula for deflection can be written as δ = (8 W D^3 n) / (G d^4) if the spring has closed ends. But in some sources, I've seen the formula as δ = (64 W R^3 n) / (G d^4), where R is the mean radius. So which one is correct? Let me try to think. The mean radius R is (D_out + D_in)/2. But since D_in = D_out - 2d, as I found earlier, R would be (D_out + (D_out - 2d))/2 = (2 D_out - 2d)/2 = D_out - d.

Wait, using R in the formula might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe it's better to express everything in terms of D, the outside diameter, and d, the wire diameter.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula that involves the wire diameter d, the outside diameter D, the number of turns n, the shear modulus G, and the load W. So the formula is δ = (8 W D^3 n)/(G d^4) multiplied by a factor. But I'm not sure about the factor. Let me think about the units to see if they make sense.

Shear modulus G has units of psi (lb/in²). W is in lb, D is in inches, d is in inches, n is dimensionless. So let's see: units of δ would be (lb * in³ * ) / (lb/in² * in^4) ) → (lb * in^3) / (lb * in^6) ) → 1/in^3 → which can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm missing a factor. Alternatively, maybe the formula is δ = (8 W D^3 n) / (G d^4) * (1/ something). Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach. The shear stress in the wire is τ = (8 W D)/(π d³). But the deflection is another formula. I'm getting a bit stuck here, so perhaps I should look for the correct formula.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the deflection (δ) of a helical spring with closed ends (like squared and ground ends) is:

δ = (8 W D³ n) / (G d^4)

Where:
- W is the axial load (in lb)
- D is the outside diameter (in inches)
- n is the number of coils
- G is the modulus of rigidity (shear modulus) in psi
- d is the wire diameter in inches

So I can plug in the values.

Wait, but wait, in this case, the wire diameter d is 1.775 inches, as I calculated earlier. Let me confirm that. The outside diameter is 3.8 in, inside is 0.25 in, so d = (3.8 -0.25)/2 = 3.55 /2 = 1.775 in. That seems correct.

So plugging in the numbers:

δ = (8 * 90 lb * (3.8 in)^3 * 18) / (12e6 psi * (1.775 in)^4 )

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute the numerator:

8 * 90 = 720

3.8^3 = let's compute that. 3.8 * 3.8 = 14.44; 14.44 *3.8 = approx 54.872 in^3.

So 720 * 54.872 = Let's see, 700*54.872 = 38,410 + (20 *54.872) = 1,097.44 → total 39,507.44.

Then multiply by 18: 39,507.44 *18. Hmm, 39,507 *10=395,070; 39,507 *8=316,056 → total 711,126.44. So numerator is 711,126.44 lb·in^3.

Wait, no, I think I messed up the order. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, actually, 8 *90 =720. Then multiply by (3.8)^3 which is 54.872. So 720 *54.872 = let's compute 700*54.872=38,410; 20 *54.872=1,097.44 → total 39,507.44.

Then multiply by 18: 39,507.44 *18. 39,507 *10=395,070; 39,507 *8=316,056 → 395,070 +316,056 =711,126. So the numerator is 711,126 lb·in^3.

Wait, but wait, the formula is (8 W D^3 n) → so 8 *90 * (3.8)^3 * 18.

Wait, maybe I should compute each term step by step.

Compute 8 *90 =720.

Compute D^3 =3.8^3=54.872 in³.

Multiply by n=18: 54.872 *18=987.696 in³.

Now multiply 720 *987.696 → let's compute 700 *987.696 = 691,386; 20 *987.696=19,753.92 → total 711,139.92 lb·in³.

Now the denominator: 12e6 psi * (1.775 in)^4.

Compute (1.775)^4:

First compute 1.775^2 = approx 3.1506 in².

Then square that: 3.1506^2 ≈ 9.922 in⁴.

So denominator is 12e6 * 9.922 = 118,464,000 psi·in⁴.

Now, δ = numerator / denominator = 711,139.92 / 118,464,000.

Let me compute that. 711,139.92 ÷ 118,464,000 ≈ 0.006 in.

Wait, that can't be right. 0.006 inches is way too small, especially given the answer choices are in inches but all over the place, like 7,8,9, etc. So I must have made a mistake in the formula or calculations.

Hmm, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Maybe the formula uses the wire diameter differently. Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the wire diameter calculation.

Wait a minute, I think I might have confused the formula. Let me try to recall again. Oh wait, I think the correct formula is δ = (8 W D^3 n)/(G d^4) for springs with closed and ground ends. But maybe I should double-check the formula's units.

Wait, let me think about the units. The numerator has W in lb, D^3 in in³, n is dimensionless. So numerator is lb·in³.

Denominator: G is in psi (lb/in²), d^4 is in in^4. So denominator is (lb/in²) * in^4 = lb·in².

So overall, δ has units (lb·in^3)/(lb·in²) )= in. So units are correct.

Wait, but the result I got was about 0.006 inches, which is way too small. So perhaps I made a calculation error, or perhaps I used the wrong formula.

Wait another thought: perhaps I should use the mean diameter instead of the outside diameter. The formula might use the mean radius. Let me think. The mean radius R is (D_out + D_in)/2. D_out is 3.8 in, D_in is 0.25 in. So R = (3.8 +0.25)/2 =4.05/2=2.025 in. Then, the formula might involve R^3 instead of D^3. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is δ = (64 W R^3 n)/(G d^4). Let me try that.

So R is 2.025 in. So R^3 is (2.025)^3 ≈ 8.238 in³.

So numerator becomes 64 *90 *8.238 *18.

Compute 64*90=5760.

5760 *8.238 ≈ let's compute 5000*8.238=41,190; 760*8.238≈6,260.88 → total 47,450.88.

Multiply by 18: 47,450.88 *18 = 853,  47,450.88 *10=474,508.8; 47,450.88 *8=379,607.04 → total 854,115.84.

Denominator: G*d^4 → 12e6 * (1.775)^4.

We already calculated (1.775)^4 ≈ 9.922 in^4.

So denominator is 12e6 *9.922 = 118,464,000 psi·in^4.

So δ = 854,115.84 / 118,464,000 ≈ approx 0.0072 in. Wait, that's even smaller. So that can't be right either.

Hmm, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the wire diameter as the difference between outside and inside diameters, which would be 3.8 - 0.25 = 3.55 in. But that seems like a very large wire diameter. If I use d=3.55 in, that would change the calculation.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating d. Let me think again. The wire diameter is actually the difference between the outside and inside diameters. Because the wire wraps around, the inside diameter is D_in = D_out - 2d, so solving for d gives d = (D_out - D_in)/2. So yes, d = (3.8 - 0.25)/2 = 1.775 in. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me try to look up the formula for a helical spring's deflection.

Oh wait, I think I'm confusing the formula. The correct formula for deflection when the spring is compressed by a load W is:

δ = (8 W D^3 n) / (G d^4) for springs with closed ends.

But I've also seen another formula where δ = (64 W R^3 n) / (G d^4), where R is the mean radius. So maybe I should use R=2.025 in in that formula.

Let me try that.

So R=2.025 in. R^3 = 2.025^3 ≈8.238 in³.

So δ = (64 *90 *8.238 *18) / (12e6 * (1.775)^4 )

Compute numerator: 64 *90=5760.

5760 *8.238 ≈5760*8=46,080; 5760*0.238≈1,372.08 → total ≈47,452.08.

Multiply by 18: 47,452.08 *18 ≈ let's compute 47,452 *10=474,520; 47,452 *8=379,616 → total 854,136.

Denominator: 12e6 * (1.775)^4 =12e6 *9.922≈118,464,000.

So δ ≈854,136 /118,464,000 ≈ approx 0.0072 inches. That's still way too small. The answer choices are around 7 to 16 inches.

Hmm, something's wrong here. Maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Let me think again.

Wait another approach: perhaps the formula is δ = (W * n * D^3) / (G * d^4) * factor.

Wait, if W is 90 lbs, n is 18, D is 3.8 in, G is 12e6 psi, d is 1.775 in.

So without any factor, δ = (90 *18 *3.8^3) / (12e6 *1.775^4 )

Compute numerator: 90*18=1620
