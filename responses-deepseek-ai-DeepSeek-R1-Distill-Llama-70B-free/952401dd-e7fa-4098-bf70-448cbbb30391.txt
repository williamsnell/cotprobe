Okay, so I'm trying to solve this calculus problem. It's about finding derivatives of a vector function. Let me think through this step by step.

The vector function r(t) is given as [ln(t³ + 1), e^(-2t), t²]. I need to find four things at t=0: the first derivative dr/dt, its magnitude, the second derivative d²r/dt², and its magnitude.

First, let me find the first derivative dr/dt. I'll differentiate each component separately.

1. For the first component, ln(t³ +1). The derivative of ln(u) is (u')/u. So here, u = t³ +1, so du/dt is 3t². Therefore, the derivative is (3t²)/(t³ +1). At t=0, this becomes (0)/(1) = 0.

2. The second component is e^(-2t). The derivative of e^{kt} is k*e^{kt}, so here k is -2. So derivative is -2 e^{-2t}. At t=0, e^0 is 1, so this is -2*1 = -2.

3. The third component is t². The derivative is 2t. At t=0, that's 0.

So dr/dt at t=0 is [0, -2, 0]. That's part 1 done.

Next, the magnitude of dr/dt at t=0. The magnitude is the square root of the sum of squares of the components. So:

|dr/dt| = sqrt(0² + (-2)² + 0²) = sqrt(0 +4 +0) = sqrt(4) = 2. So that's part 2.

Now, part 3: the second derivative d²r/dt². I'll need to differentiate dr/dt again.

Looking back, dr/dt is [ (3t²)/(t³ +1) , -2 e^{-2t}, 2t ].

So I'll differentiate each component again.

1. First component: d/dt [ (3t²)/(t³ +1) ). Let's use the quotient rule. Let u =3t², v = t³ +1. So u’ =6t, v’ =3t².

The derivative is (u’v - uv’) / v². Plugging in:

(6t*(t³+1) - 3t²*(3t²)) / (t³ +1)^2.

Simplify numerator: 6t(t³ +1) =6t^4 +6t. And 3t²*3t² =9t^4. So numerator is 6t^4 +6t -9t^4 = -3t^4 +6t.

So the derivative is (-3t^4 +6t)/(t³ +1)^2.

At t=0, let's plug in t=0: numerator is 0 +0 =0, denominator is 1^2=1. So this component is 0.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check that again. At t=0, the numerator is -3*(0)^4 +6*(0) = 0, so yes, 0.

2. Second component: derivative of -2e^{-2t} is (-2)*(-2) e^{-2t} =4 e^{-2t}. At t=0, e^0 is 1, so 4*1=4.

3. Third component: derivative of 2t is 2. So that's 2.

So the second derivative d²r/dt² at t=0 is [0,4,2]. That's part 3.

Part 4 is the magnitude of this second derivative. So |d²r/dt²| is sqrt(0² +4² +2²) = sqrt(0+16+4) = sqrt(20). Which can be written as sqrt(20) or 2*sqrt(5).

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: [0,-2,0], |dr/dt|=2; [0,4,2], |d²r/dt²|=sqrt(20). So that matches.

Option B: First component of dr/dt is 1, which is incorrect because we had 0.

Option C: |dr/dt|=3, which is wrong. So no.

Option D: dr/dt has third component 1, but we had 0. So wrong.

So the correct answer must be option A.

To solve the problem, we analyze the vector function \( \mathbf{r}(t) = [\ln(t^3 + 1), e^{-2t}, t^2] \) and compute the required derivatives and magnitudes at \( t = 0 \).

### 1. First Derivative \( \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} \)
We differentiate each component of \( \mathbf{r}(t) \):
- For \( \ln(t^3 + 1) \), the derivative is \( \frac{3t^2}{t^3 + 1} \). At \( t = 0 \), this becomes \( 0 \).
- For \( e^{-2t} \), the derivative is \( -2e^{-2t} \). At \( t = 0 \), this becomes \( -2 \).
- For \( t^2 \), the derivative is \( 2t \). At \( t = 0 \), this becomes \( 0 \).

Thus, \( \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} \big|_{t=0} = [0, -2, 0] \).

### 2. Magnitude of \( \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} \) at \( t = 0 \)
The magnitude is calculated as:
\[
\left| \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} \right| \big|_{t=0} = \sqrt{0^2 + (-2)^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{4} = 2.
\]

### 3. Second Derivative \( \frac{d^2\mathbf{r}}{dt^2} \)
We differentiate \( \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} = \left[ \frac{3t^2}{t^3 + 1}, -2e^{-2t}, 2t \right] \):
- For \( \frac{3t^2}{t^3 + 1} \), using the quotient rule, the derivative is \( \frac{-3t^4 + 6t}{(t^3 + 1)^2} \). At \( t = 0 \), this becomes \( 0 \).
- For \( -2e^{-2t} \), the derivative is \( 4e^{-2t} \). At \( t = 0 \), this becomes \( 4 \).
- For \( 2t \), the derivative is \( 2 \).

Thus, \( \frac{d^2\mathbf{r}}{dt^2} \big|_{t=0} = [0, 4, 2] \).

### 4. Magnitude of \( \frac{d^2\mathbf{r}}{dt^2} \) at \( t = 0 \)
The magnitude is calculated as:
\[
\left| \frac{d^2\mathbf{r}}{dt^2} \right| \big|_{t=0} = \sqrt{0^2 + 4^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{16 + 4} = \sqrt{20}.
\]

### Final Answer
Comparing the results with the options:
- \( \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} \big|_{t=0} = [0, -2, 0] \), \( \left| \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} \right| \big|_{t=0} = 2 \), \( \frac{d^2\mathbf{r}}{dt^2} \big|_{t=0} = [0, 4, 2] \), and \( \left| \frac{d^2\mathbf{r}}{dt^2} \right| \big|_{t=0} = \sqrt{20} \) match **Option A**.
