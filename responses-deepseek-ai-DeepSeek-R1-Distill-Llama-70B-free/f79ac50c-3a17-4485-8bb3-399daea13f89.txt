Question:

E.F. Schumacher, famous economist, in an article in the Atlantic (April 1979): Fifteen months [after I had advised that rural India should have a technology intermediate between the hoe and the tractor,] an all-India conference on intermediate technology was arranged. (They still didn't like the term [intermediate], so they called it appropriate technology. That's all right: when I come to India and somebody says, "Oh, Mr. Schumacher, I don't believe in appropriate technology", I just look him straight in the face and say, "Oh, that's splendid. Do you believe in inappropriate technology?")

Options:

A: Equivocation
B: Inconsistency
C: Appeal to Authority
D: Prejudicial Language

Okay, so I've got this question about a passage by E.F. Schumacher and I need to figure out which logical fallacy it's using. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand.

The passage says that Schumacher advised using an intermediate technology in rural India, which is between a hoe and a tractor. Fifteen months later, a conference was held on intermediate technology, but they didn't like the term "intermediate," so they called it "appropriate technology." Schumacher then says that when someone in India tells him they don't believe in appropriate technology, he responds by asking if they believe in inappropriate technology, which he thinks is splendid.

Hmm, so the question is asking what kind of fallacy this is. The options are A: Equivocation, B: Inconsistency, C: Appeal to Authority, D: Prejudicial Language.

I remember that logical fallacies are errors in reasoning that can undermine the logic of an argument. Let me think about each option.

Equivocation is when a word is used with two or more meanings in the same argument, leading to a misleading conclusion. So like using a term in a way that shifts its meaning during the argument. In this case, Schumacher is using "appropriate" and "inappropriate" technology. But wait, he's not changing the meaning of the word; he's using it in a way that points out the absurdity of rejecting appropriate technology because it implies they support the opposite.

Inconsistency would be if the argument contradicts itself or is inconsistent in its claims. I don't see that here. Schumacher is being consistent in promoting appropriate technology.

Appeal to Authority is when someone uses the opinion of an authority figure to support their argument, rather than evidence. Schumacher isn't citing any authority here; he's using a rhetorical question.

Prejudicial Language refers to using language that is biased or emotive to influence opinion rather than logic. When he says "inappropriate technology," it's a loaded term because who would support something that's "inappropriate"? It's like using a term that has a negative connotation to make the other side's position seem unreasonable.

Wait, so Schumacher is using the term "inappropriate" in a way that's emotionally loaded. By asking if they believe in inappropriate technology, he's framing the alternative as something obviously bad, making the other person's rejection of appropriate technology look silly. That's using language with a negative connotation to sway opinion, which fits Prejudicial Language.

Alternatively, could it be Equivocation? Let me double-check. Equivocation would involve using the same term with different meanings. Here, the term "appropriate" is used in a way that's consistent, so it's not about changing meanings but about the emotional impact of the word "inappropriate."

So I think the correct answer is D: Prejudicial Language.

The passage by E.F. Schumacher involves a rhetorical strategy where he uses the term "inappropriate technology" to frame the rejection of "appropriate technology" as unreasonable. This tactic employs emotionally charged language to influence opinion, which aligns with the definition of Prejudicial Language.
