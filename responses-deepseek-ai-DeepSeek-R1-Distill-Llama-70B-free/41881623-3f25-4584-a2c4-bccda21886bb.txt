Okay, so I have this question: How many structurally distinct Abelian groups have order 72? And I need to choose the correct option from A to J. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my group theory, but I'll try to work through it.

First, I remember that Abelian groups can be classified by their structure when they're finite. The Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups says that every finite Abelian group is a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order. So the problem is about finding all the possible ways to decompose 72 into such factors.

Wait, 72 is the order of the group, right? So I should factor 72 into its prime components. Let me see, 72 divided by 2 is 36, divided by 2 again is 18, and once more by 2 is 9. So 2^3 * 3^2. So the prime factors are 2 and 3, with exponents 3 and 2 respectively.

Now, for Abelian groups, the structure is determined by the decomposition of the order into the product of cyclic groups of prime power order. So for each prime, I have exponents that sum up to the exponent in the prime factorization.

Wait, no, wait. The exponents in the cyclic factors have to add up to the exponent in the original number for each prime. Oh right, because when you have a group like Z_a × Z_b, the order is a*b, but only if a and b are coprime. So for each prime, the exponents in the cyclic factors must add up to the exponent of that prime in the overall order.

So for the prime 2, which has exponent 3 in 72, I can split this into different ways. Similarly for 3, which has exponent 2.

So for each prime, the number of ways to write the exponents as a sum of positive integers. For 2^3, the possible ways are the integer partitions of 3. The same for 3^2, the partitions of 2.

Let me think about the partitions.

For 3: the partitions are:
1. 3
2. 2 + 1
3. 1 + 1 + 1

So three ways for the 2^3 part.

For 2: the partitions are:
1. 2
2. 1 + 1

So two ways for the 3^2 part.

Now, the total number of Abelian groups is the product of the number of ways for each prime. Because each way for 2's exponents can be combined with each way for 3's exponents.

So 3 (for 2^3) multiplied by 2 (for 3^2) gives 3*2=6. So there are 6 structurally distinct Abelian groups of order 72.

Wait, but I should double-check. Each partition corresponds to a different direct product. For example, for 2^3, the possible cyclic decompositions are:

- Z_8 × Z_1 (since 8=2^3, but wait, Z_1 is trivial, so it's just Z_8)
- Z_4 × Z_2
- Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2

And for 3^2:

- Z_9 × Z_1 → which is Z_9
- Z_3 × Z_3

So for each combination, you take one decomposition for 2's part and one for 3's part. So the total is 3 * 2 = 6.

Wait, but wait another thought. Are these all unique? For example, let's list all possible combinations.

1. For 2^3: Z_8; for 3^2: Z_9. So overall group is Z_8 × Z_9. Since 8 and 9 are coprime, this is isomorphic to Z_{72}.

2. For 2^3: Z_8; for 3^2: Z_3 × Z_3. So Z_8 × Z_3 × Z_3.

3. For 2^3: Z_4 × Z_2; for 3^2: Z_9. So Z_4 × Z_2 × Z_9.

4. For 2^3: Z_4 × Z_2; for 3^2: Z_3 × Z_3. So Z_4 × Z_2 × Z_3 × Z_3.

Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Because when you have multiple factors, you can rearrange them as long as the orders are coprime.

Wait, for example, Z_4 × Z_2 × Z_3 × Z_3 can be rearranged as (Z_4 × Z_2) × (Z_3 × Z_3) ) since 4 and 2 are 2-powers, and 3s are 3-powers. So each part is a direct product of groups of coprime orders, so the structure is determined by the product of cyclic groups for each prime.

Wait, but when you have multiple factors that are coprime, the order of the group is the product, but the structure is determined by the individual cyclic components. So each decomposition for each prime contributes independently.

So the number of Abelian groups is the product of the number of ways to decompose each prime power part. So yeah, 3 ways for 2^3 and 2 ways for 3^2 gives 3*2=6. So the answer should be 6, which is option C.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure I'm not missing any possibilities. Let's list all possible combinations.

Possible cyclic decompositions for 2^3:

1. [8]
2. [4,2]
3. [2,2,2]

For 3^2:

a. [9]
b. [3,3]

So the combinations are:

1a. [8,9] → Z8×Z9 → Z72 (cyclic)
1b. [8,3,3] → Z8×Z3×Z3

2a. [4,2,9] → Z4×Z2×Z9 → but since 2 divides 4, this is isomorphic to Z4×Z9 × Z2, but wait, no, because 4 and 9 are coprime, 2 and 9 are coprime, etc. So it's a valid group.

Wait, but wait, when you have multiple factors, the order isn't necessarily the product if they're not pairwise coprime, but in this case, since 4=2^2, 2=2^1, and 9=3^2, the cyclic components are for different primes, so their direct product's order is the product. So each combination is a unique group.

So the six combinations are:

1a. Z8 × Z9 → cyclic of order 72.

1b. Z8 × Z3 × Z3.

2a. Z4 × Z2 × Z9.

2b. Z4 × Z2 × Z3 × Z3.

3a. Z2 × Z2 × Z2 × Z9.

3b. Z2 × Z2 × Z2 × Z3 × Z3.

Wait, but wait, are 3a and 3b the same? No, because in 3a, the 3s are in Z9, which is a single cyclic group of order 9. In 3b, the 3s are in two cyclic groups of order 3 each.

So each is distinct.

Thus, there are 3×2=6 distinct groups. So the correct answer is 6, which is option C.

To determine how many structurally distinct Abelian groups have order 72, we use the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups. This theorem states that every finite Abelian group can be expressed as a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order. The order of the group is factored into its prime components, and the number of distinct groups is determined by the number of ways to decompose these prime power factors into sums of positive integers (integer partitions).

1. **Prime Factorization of 72**:  
   The order 72 factors as \( 72 = 2^3 \cdot 3^2 \). For each prime power (\( 2^3 \) and \( 3^2 \)), we find the number of ways to partition the exponent into sums of positive integers.

2. **Partitions for \( 2^3 \)**:  
   The integer partitions of 3 are:  
   - \( 3 \)  
   - \( 2 + 1 \)  
   - \( 1 + 1 + 1 \)  
   This gives 3 ways to decompose \( 2^3 \).

3. **Partitions for \( 3^2 \)**:  
   The integer partitions of 2 are:  
   - \( 2 \)  
   - \( 1 + 1 \)  
   This gives 2 ways to decompose \( 3^2 \).

4. **Total Number of Abelian Groups**:  
   The total number of structurally distinct Abelian groups is the product of the number of ways to decompose each prime power:  
   \[
   3 \, (\text{for } 2^3) \times 2 \, (\text{for } 3^2) = 6
   \]

5. **Verification of Distinct Groups**:  
   Each partition corresponds to a unique direct product of cyclic groups. For example:  
   - \( [8, 9] \) corresponds to \( \mathbb{Z}_8 \times \mathbb{Z}_9 \) (cyclic group of order 72).  
   - \( [8, 3, 3] \) corresponds to \( \mathbb{Z}_8 \times \mathbb{Z}_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_3 \).  
   - \( [4, 2, 9] \) corresponds to \( \mathbb{Z}_4 \times \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_9 \).  
   - \( [4, 2, 3, 3] \) corresponds to \( \mathbb{Z}_4 \times \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_3 \).  
   - \( [2, 2, 2, 9] \) corresponds to \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_9 \).  
   - \( [2, 2, 2, 3, 3] \) corresponds to \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_3 \).  

   All these groups are structurally distinct because the cyclic factors have different orders or distributions.

Thus, the number of structurally distinct Abelian groups of order 72 is **6**.
