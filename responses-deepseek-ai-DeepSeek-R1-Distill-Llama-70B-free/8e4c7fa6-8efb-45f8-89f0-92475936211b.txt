Question:

It is estimated that 3 × 10^5 tons of sulfur dioxide, SO_2, enters the atmosphere daily owing to the burning of coal and petroleum products. Assuming an even distribution of the sulfur dioxide throughout the earth's atmosphere (which is not the case) , calculate in parts per million by weight the concentration of SO_2 added daily to the atmosphere. The weight of the atmosphere is 4.5 × 10^15 tons. (On the average, about 40 days are required for the removal of the SO_2 by rain).

Options:

A: 1.5 × 10^-5 ppm SO_2
B: 3.0 × 10^5 ppm SO_2
C: 5 × 10^-6 ppm SO_2
D: 7 × 10^-6 ppm SO_2
E: 6.67 × 10^-5 ppm SO_2
F: 1.2 × 10^-4 ppm SO_2
G: 9.0 × 10^-5 ppm SO_2
H: 4.5 × 10^15 ppm SO_2
I: 2.0 × 10^-5 ppm SO_2
J: 8 × 10^-5 ppm SO_2

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about sulfur dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. Hmm, let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem says that 3 × 10^5 tons of SO2 are added to the atmosphere each day. And we need to find the concentration in parts per million by weight. Oh right, parts per million (ppm) is a measure of concentration, where one part is a million parts of the whole. So in this case, it's ppm by weight, meaning we're comparing the weight of SO2 to the total weight of the atmosphere.

Wait, but the atmosphere's weight is given as 4.5 × 10^15 tons. So the idea is to take the amount of SO2 added each day and divide it by the atmosphere's total weight, then multiply by a million to get ppm.

Wait no, wait. Let me think again. Because ppm is (mass of solute)/(mass of solution) × 1e6. So yes, that's correct.

So the formula would be ppm = (mass of SO2 / mass of atmosphere) × 1,000,000.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says that SO2 is added daily, and the atmosphere's weight is a huge number. So the calculation is just (3e5 tons) / (4.5e15 tons) * 1e6.

Let me compute that. Let's do the math step by step.

3e5 divided by 4.5e15. Let's see, 3 divided by 4.5 is 0.666..., and 1e5 / 1e15 is 1e-10. So 0.666...e-10 is 6.666...e-11.

Then multiply by 1e6 to get ppm. So 6.666e-11 * 1e6 = 6.666e-5 ppm.

Wait, let me double-check that. 3e5 / 4.5e15 = (3/4.5) * (1e5/1e15) = 0.666... * 1e-10 = 6.666...e-11. Then multiply by 1e6 gives 6.666e-5.

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches. Option E is 6.67e-5 ppm, which looks like the correct answer.

Wait, but I just remembered, the problem mentions that about 40 days are required for removal by rain. Oh, but the question is about the concentration added daily, assuming even distribution. So I think that part about 40 days is a red herring here. Because the question is asking for the daily addition, not considering that it's built up over time. So I don't think the 40 days affects the calculation here.

So yeah, the correct answer should be E: 6.67 × 10^-5 ppm SO2.

To calculate the concentration of sulfur dioxide (SO₂) in parts per million by weight (ppm), we use the formula:

\[
\text{ppm} = \left( \frac{\text{mass of SO}_2}{\text{mass of atmosphere}} \right) \times 10^6
\]

The given values are:
- Daily SO₂ added: \( 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{tons} \)
- Mass of the atmosphere: \( 4.5 \times 10^{15} \, \text{tons} \)

Substituting these into the formula:

\[
\text{ppm} = \left( \frac{3 \times 10^5}{4.5 \times 10^{15}} \right) \times 10^6
\]

First, calculate the ratio:

\[
\frac{3 \times 10^5}{4.5 \times 10^{15}} = \frac{3}{4.5} \times 10^{-10} = 0.666\ldots \times 10^{-10} = 6.666\ldots \times 10^{-11}
\]

Now multiply by \( 10^6 \):

\[
6.666\ldots \times 10^{-11} \times 10^6 = 6.666\ldots \times 10^{-5}
\]

Thus, the concentration of SO₂ added daily is approximately \( 6.67 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{ppm} \).

The mention of "40 days required for removal by rain" is not relevant to this calculation, as the question asks only for the daily concentration.

The correct answer is:

**E: \( 6.67 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{ppm SO}_2 \)**
