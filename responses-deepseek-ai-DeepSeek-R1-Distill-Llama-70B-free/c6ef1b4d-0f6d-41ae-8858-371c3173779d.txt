Okay, so I have this problem here about passing an algebra test at Academic Academy. The rule is that you need to score at least 80% to pass. There are 35 problems on the test, and the question is asking for the greatest number of problems you can miss and still pass. The options are from A to J, with various numbers.

Hmm, I should start by understanding what 80% means in terms of the number of correct answers. Since there are 35 problems, I need to calculate 80% of 35. Wait, let me think about that. To find 80% of 35, I can convert 80% to a decimal, which is 0.8, and multiply it by 35.

So, 0.8 times 35 equals... let's see, 0.8 times 30 is 24, and 0.8 times 5 is 4, so together that's 28. So 28 correct answers are needed to pass.

But wait, the question is about how many you can miss, not how many you need to get right. So if you need 28 correct, then the number of missed questions would be the total minus the correct ones. That's 35 minus 28, which equals 7.

Let me double-check that. If I miss 7 questions, that means I got 28 right. 28 out of 35 is indeed 80%, so that's exactly the passing score. Therefore, missing 7 is the maximum you can miss and still pass.

Looking at the options, option B is 7. So the answer should be B.

To determine the greatest number of questions you can miss and still pass, you need to achieve at least 80% of the total questions correct. 

1. Calculate 80% of 35 problems:  
   \( 0.8 \times 35 = 28 \) correct answers.  
2. Subtract the correct answers from the total to find the number of questions you can miss:  
   \( 35 - 28 = 7 \) missed questions.  

Thus, the greatest number of questions you can miss and still pass is 7.

The correct answer is B.
