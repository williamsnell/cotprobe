Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Ross Perot and his performance in a presidential election. The question is asking what percentage of the popular vote he ended up with. Hmm, I remember Ross Perot was a third-party candidate, right? He ran in the 90s, I think. Was it 1992 or 1996? I believe it was 1992 because that's when the big three were George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Perot.

Wait, the question says he briefly led the race in June with 39% but then ended up with a lower percentage. I remember that Perot actually did pretty well for a third-party candidate. So, I'm trying to recall the exact number. I think he got around 18-19% of the vote. Let me think, I've heard that before. Yeah, I think it was 19%.

Looking at the options, G is 19 and F is 21. So between those, I'm more confident about 19%. Wait, but wait, did he actually get 19%? Or was it 18.9% which would round to 19. Or maybe it's 18.9, but the options don't have 18. The closest is G:19. So I think G is the right answer.

Alternatively, I might be confusing it with another election. Wait, in 1996, Perot ran again but got less, around 8%. So that's option B:7, but that's not the case here because the question is about when he led briefly, which I think was 1992.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be G:19.

The correct answer is G:19.
