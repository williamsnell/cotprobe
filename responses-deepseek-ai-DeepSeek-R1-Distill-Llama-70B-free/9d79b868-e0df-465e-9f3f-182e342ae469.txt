Okay, so I need to figure out how many grams of NH3 are required to react with 80 grams of O2 based on the given balanced equation. Hmm, let's start by looking at the equation again: 4NH3(g) + 5O2(g) → 4NO(g) + 6H2O(g). 

Alright, the first thing I remember is that in a balanced chemical equation, the coefficients represent the mole ratios of the reactants and products. So here, 4 moles of NH3 react with 5 moles of O2. That means the mole ratio of NH3 to O2 is 4:5. 

But wait, I'm dealing with grams here, not moles. So I'll need to convert the grams of O2 into moles first, and then use the mole ratio to find the moles of NH3 required. After that, I can convert moles of NH3 back into grams. 

Let me jot down the steps:
1. Find moles of O2: grams of O2 divided by molar mass of O2.
2. Use mole ratio to find moles of NH3 needed.
3. Convert moles of NH3 to grams using its molar mass.

So starting with O2: The molar mass of O2 is 32 g/mol (since each O atom is 16 g/mol, and there are two of them). I have 80 grams of O2. So moles of O2 = 80 g / 32 g/mol. Let me calculate that: 80 divided by 32 is 2.5 moles of O2.

Now the mole ratio from the equation is 4 NH3 to 5 O2. So for every 5 moles of O2, I need 4 moles of NH3. So moles of NH3 = (4/5) * moles of O2. 

Plugging in the numbers: (4/5) * 2.5 moles. Let me compute that. 4 divided by 5 is 0.8. 0.8 times 2.5 is 2. So I need 2 moles of NH3.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that calculation. 4/5 is 0.8. 0.8 * 2.5 is indeed 2. So that's correct.

Now, converting moles of NH3 to grams. The molar mass of NH3 is 14 (N) + 3*(1) (H) = 17 g/mol. So grams of NH3 = moles * molar mass = 2 * 17 = 34 grams.

Wait, but looking at the options, option G is 34 grams. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Oh wait, no, wait another thing. Wait, the ratio is 4 NH3 to 5 O2, right? So for every 5 moles of O2, 4 moles of NH3 are needed. So if I have 2.5 moles of O2, then moles of NH3 would be (4/5)*2.5 = 2 moles. Then 2 moles * 17 g/mol is 34 grams. So that's correct.

Wait, but I'm looking at the options again and I don't see 34 as one of the first options. Wait the options are:

A:60, B:72, C:32, D:56, E:40, F:24, G:34, H:48, I:68, J:80.

Oh yes, option G is 34. So the correct answer should be G. But wait, wait, did I do all the steps correctly?

Let me go through again. 80 grams O2 is 80/32 = 2.5 moles. The ratio is 4 NH3:5 O2, so (4/5)*2.5 = (4 * 2.5)/5 = 10/5=2 moles NH3. Then 2 * 17 =34 grams. Yes, that's right. So the correct answer is G.

To determine how many grams of NH₃ are required to react with 80 g of O₂, we use the balanced equation:

\[
4NH_3 (g) + 5O_2 (g) \rightarrow 4NO (g) + 6H_2O (g)
\]

### Step 1: Convert grams of O₂ to moles
The molar mass of O₂ is \( 32 \, \text{g/mol} \). Using the formula:

\[
\text{Moles of O}_2 = \frac{\text{Mass of O}_2}{\text{Molar mass of O}_2} = \frac{80}{32} = 2.5 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 2: Use the mole ratio to find moles of NH₃
From the balanced equation, the mole ratio of NH₃ to O₂ is \( 4:5 \). Therefore:

\[
\text{Moles of NH}_3 = \frac{4}{5} \times \text{Moles of O}_2 = \frac{4}{5} \times 2.5 = 2 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 3: Convert moles of NH₃ to grams
The molar mass of NH₃ is \( 17 \, \text{g/mol} \). Using the formula:

\[
\text{Mass of NH}_3 = \text{Moles of NH}_3 \times \text{Molar mass of NH}_3 = 2 \times 17 = 34 \, \text{g}
\]

### Final Answer
The correct answer is **G: 34 g**.
