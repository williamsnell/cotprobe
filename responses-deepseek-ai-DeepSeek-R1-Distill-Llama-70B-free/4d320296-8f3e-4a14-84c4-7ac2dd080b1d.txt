Okay, I'm trying to solve this statistics problem. Let me read it again carefully.

So the question is about the longevity of people in a certain area. The standard deviation is 14 years. We need to find the mean longevity given that 30% of the people live longer than 75 years. They also mention that the distribution is normal, which is important because it means we can use Z-scores and the standard normal distribution table.

Hmm, right. In a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all the same. So the average longevity would be at the peak of the bell curve.

Wait, but the problem is giving me a percentage of people who live longer than 75. I think I need to find out how many standard deviations away from the mean 75 is, and then use that to find the mean.

So 30% live longer than 75. That means that 70% live 75 or less. So the probability that a person's longevity is less than or equal to 75 is 70%, or 0.7.

In terms of Z-scores, I can find the Z value where the cumulative probability is 0.7. Once I have that Z, I can relate it to the mean using the formula: Z = (X - μ) / σ.

Let me think about the Z-table. I remember that a cumulative probability of 0.7 is a bit less than the Z for 0.70. Oh wait, the Z-table gives the area to the left of Z. So looking up 0.70 in the table, what's the corresponding Z?

Wait, I recall that Z=0.524 is approximately where the cumulative probability is 0.70. Let me confirm: Z of 0.52 is about 0.6985, and Z=0.53 is 0.7019. Oh, so 0.70 is between Z=0.52 and 0.53. Maybe more accurately, it's around 0.5244. I think the exact value is approximately 0.5244 for 0.70.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again because I might be mixing things up. The Z for which P(Z <= z) = 0.7 is about 0.524. Alternatively, using a calculator or more precise table would give a more accurate value. But for the sake of this problem, I'll go with 0.5244 as the Z-score.

So, using the formula Z = (X - μ) / σ. We can rearrange this to solve for μ: μ = X - Z * σ.

Wait, wait. Because if 70% are below 75, then X is 75, and the Z is positive. So plugging into the formula:

Z = (75 - μ) / σ.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The formula is Z = (X - μ) / σ. If X is the value where 70% are below it, then X is 75. So:

Z = (75 - μ) / 14.

We have Z as approximately 0.5244. So,

0.5244 = (75 - μ) / 14.

Solving for μ: multiply both sides by 14.

0.5244 * 14 = 75 - μ.

Let me compute 0.5244 * 14. Let's see, 0.5 * 14 is 7, 0.0244 *14 is about 0.3416. So total is 7.3416.

So 7.3416 = 75 - μ.

Then μ = 75 - 7.3416 = 67.6584.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 67.6584 directly, but perhaps that's not needed. Let's see the options:

Option F is 75 - 0.5244(14), which would be 75 - 7.3416 = 67.6584. So that's what I got. So the mean is 67.6584.

Wait, but let me double-check the reasoning. Because 30% live longer than 75, so 70% live less than or equal to 75.

In a normal distribution, the mean is where 50% are below and 50% above. Since 70% are below 75, that means 75 is to the right of the mean. So the mean must be less than 75. So when I subtract from 75, that would give me the mean. So yes, the correct formula is μ = 75 - Z*σ.

Wait, no, let me think again. The Z-score is the number of standard deviations from the mean. If 70% are below 75, then 75 is above the mean. So X=75 is higher than μ, so (X - μ) is positive, hence Z is positive. So Z = (75 - μ)/14.

So solving for μ, μ = 75 - Z*14.

Which gives the mean as 75 minus (Z times 14).

Looking at the options, option F is exactly that: 75 - 0.5244(14), which is the calculation I did.

So the correct answer should be F.

To determine the mean longevity, we start by noting that 30% of the people live longer than 75 years, which means 70% live 75 years or less. This corresponds to a cumulative probability of 0.7 in a standard normal distribution. Using the Z-table, the Z-score for a cumulative probability of 0.7 is approximately 0.5244.

The relationship between the Z-score, the value \( X \), the mean \( \mu \), and the standard deviation \( \sigma \) is given by:

\[
Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
\]

Here, \( X = 75 \), \( \sigma = 14 \), and \( Z = 0.5244 \). Rearranging the formula to solve for \( \mu \):

\[
\mu = X - Z \cdot \sigma
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\mu = 75 - 0.5244 \cdot 14
\]

Calculating \( 0.5244 \cdot 14 \):

\[
0.5244 \cdot 14 = 7.3416
\]

Thus:

\[
\mu = 75 - 7.3416 = 67.6584
\]

This matches the formula provided in option F: \( 75 - 0.5244(14) \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**F: 75 - 0.5244(14)**
