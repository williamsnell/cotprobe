Okay, so I've got this problem here about a gas mixture of ethane and butane. Hmm, I need to find the mole percent of butane in the mixture. Let's see what data I have.

The bulb's volume is 230.0 cm³, which I think I should convert to liters because gas laws usually use liters. Oh wait, right, 230 cm³ is 0.23 liters. Got that.

The pressure is 97.5 × 10³ Pa. Wait, standard pressure units are usually in atmospheres or Pascals. I remember that 1 atm is about 101325 Pa. Let me calculate what 97.5e3 Pa is in atmospheres. So 97500 Pa divided by 101325 Pa/atm. Let me compute that: 97500 / 101325 ≈ 0.962 atm. Or maybe I should work in Pascals and use R as 8.314 J/mol·K. Hmm, not sure yet.

The temperature is 23.1°C. To Kelvin, that's 23.1 + 273.15 = 296.25 K.

The mass of the gas is 0.3554 grams. I need to find the mole percent of butane. So I think I'll have to use the ideal gas law here. Let me think about the steps.

First, the total moles of gas can be found using PV = nRT. Once I have the total moles, I can relate it to the mass to find the mole fractions.

Wait, let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate total moles (n_total) using the ideal gas law.
2. The mass of the mixture is the sum of the moles of each component times their molar masses. So, n_total = n_ethane + n_butane.
   Let me denote the mole fraction of butane as x. So, n_butane = x * n_total, and n_ethane = (1-x) * n_total.
3. The total mass is the sum: mass = (n_ethane * M_ethane) + (n_butane * M_butane)
   So, 0.3554 g = (1-x)*n_total * M_ethane + x*n_total * M_butane.
   Which can be written as 0.3554 = n_total [ (1-x)*M_ethane + x*M_butane ]
4. But I don't know n_total yet. So first compute n_total using PV = nRT.

Let me compute n_total.

Given:
P = 97,500 Pa
V = 0.230 L
R = 8.314 J/mol·K
T = 296.25 K

So n_total = (P V) / (R T)
Let me calculate that.

PV = 97500 Pa * 0.230 L = let's see, 97500 * 0.23. Let's compute that: 97500 * 0.2 is 19,500, and 97500 * 0.03 is 2,925. So total 22,425 Pa·L. Since 1 Pa·L is 1 J (because 1 Pa = 1 N/m², and 1 L is 0.001 m³, so Pa·L = N/m² * 0.001 m³ = N·m = J). So 22,425 J.

RT is 8.314 * 296.25. Let me compute that. 8 * 300 is 2400, but more accurately: 8.314 * 296.25.

Let me compute 296.25 * 8 = 2370, 296.25 * 0.314 = let's see. 0.3 * 296.25 is 88.875, 0.014 * 296.25 is approx 4.1475. So total 88.875 + 4.1475 = 93.0225. So total RT is 2370 + 93.0225 = 2463.0225 J/mol.

So n_total = 22425 J / 2463.0225 J/mol ≈ let's see, 22425 / 2463. Let me compute that. 2463 * 9 is about 22,167. 22425 - 22167 = 258. So 9 and 258/2463 ≈ 9.104 mol.

So n_total ≈ 9.104 moles.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 0.230 L is correct? Because 230 cm³ is 0.23 liters. Right.

Now, using the mass equation:

mass = n_total [ (1-x) * M_ethane + x * M_butane ]

M_ethane (C2H6) is (2*12.01) + (6*1.008) = 24.02 + 6.048 = 30.068 g/mol.

M_butane (C4H10) is (4*12.01) + (10*1.008) = 48.04 + 10.08 = 58.12 g/mol.

So,

0.3554 g = 9.104 * [ (1-x)*30.068 + x*58.12 ]

Let me compute the denominator inside the brackets:

(1-x)*30.068 + x*58.12 = 30.068 + x*(58.12 - 30.068) = 30.068 + x*28.052.

So,

0.3554 = 9.104 * (30.068 + 28.052 x )

Divide both sides by 9.104:

0.3554 / 9.104 ≈ 0.03906 = 30.068 + 28.052 x

Wait, wait. Wait, 0.3554 divided by 9.104 is approximately:

Let me compute 0.3554 / 9.104.

Well, 9.104 * 0.039 is approx 0.355. Let me check:

9.104 * 0.039 = ?

9 * 0.039 = 0.351, 0.104 * 0.039 ≈ 0.004056, total ≈ 0.355. So yes, 0.039.

So 0.039 = 30.068 + 28.052 x? Wait, no, wait:

Wait, 30.068 + 28.052 x = 0.039 ?

Wait, no. No, the equation is:

30.068 + 28.052 x = 0.03906 ?

Wait, that can't be right because 30 is much larger than 0.039. I must have made a mistake in rearrangement.

Wait, wait. Let me go back. The equation after dividing both sides by 9.104 is:

(30.068 + 28.052 x ) = 0.3554 / 9.104

Which is about 0.03906.

Wait, that's not possible because 30 is way larger than 0.039. So I must have messed up the equation.

Wait, no. Let me re-express the equation correctly.

Wait, I have:

0.3554 = 9.104 * (30.068 (1-x) + 58.12 x )

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the equation is:

0.3554 = 9.104 * [ (1-x)*30.068 + x*58.12 ]

Which can be written as:

0.3554 = 9.104 * [30.068 + x*(58.12 - 30.068) ]

Which is 30.068 + x*(28.052). So 0.3554 = 9.104*(30.068 + 28.052 x). 

Wait, that's correct. So when I divide both sides by 9.104, I get:

(30.068 + 28.052 x) = 0.3554 / 9.104 ≈ 0.03906.

Wait, but 30.068 is way larger than 0.039. So 30.068 + 28.052 x = 0.03906.

Hmm, that would suggest that 28.052 x = 0.03906 -30.068 = -30.02894.

So x = (-30.02894) / 28.052 ≈ negative value. That's impossible because mole fraction can't be negative.

Wait, that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in the equation setup.

Wait, perhaps I inverted something. Let me rederive the equations.

The mass is the sum of the moles times their molar masses.

n_total = n_ethane + n_butane.

Let x be the mole fraction of butane, so n_butane = x * n_total, and n_ethane = (1 - x) n_total.

Mass m = n_ethane * M_ethane + n_butane * M_butane.

Which is:

m = (1 - x) n_total * M_ethane + x n_total * M_butane.

Factor out n_total:

m = n_total [ (1 - x) M_ethane + x M_butane ]

Yes, that's correct.

So, in numbers, 0.3554 g = n_total [ (1 -x)(30.068) + x (58.12) ]

n_total is 9.104 mol.

So,

0.3554 = 9.104 * [ 30.068 (1 -x) + 58.12 x ]

Let me compute the bracketed part:

30.068 (1 -x) + 58.12 x = 30.068 -30.068 x +58.12 x = 30.068 + (58.12 -30.068) x = 30.068 +28.052 x.

So,

0.3554 = 9.104 * (30.068 +28.052 x )

Wait, but 9.104 times 30 is about 273.12, which is way bigger than 0.3554. So this suggests that 9.104*(...) is 0.3554, but 9.104 *30 is 273, which is way larger. So something's wrong here.

Wait, that can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating n_total.

Wait, let me recalculate n_total.

n_total = (P V)/(R T)

P is 97.5e3 Pa.

V is 0.230 L.

R is 8.314 J/mol·K.

T is 296.25 K.

So,

n_total = (97500 * 0.230) / (8.314 * 296.25 )

Calculate numerator: 97500 * 0.230 = 22,425 J·mol^{-1} ?

Wait, no, wait. Pa * L is equivalent to J, because 1 Pa = 1 N/m², 1 L = 0.001 m³. So Pa * L = (N/m²) * 0.001 m³ = N*m = J.

So, numerator is 22,425 J.

Denominator: 8.314 J/mol·K * 296.25 K = 8.314 *296.25.

Compute that:

296.25 *8 =2370, 0.314 *296.25 ≈ 93.0225, so total 2370 +93.0225=2463.0225 J/mol.

So n_total=22425 / 2463.0225 ≈ let's compute that.

22425 ÷ 2463 ≈ let's see: 2463 *9=22167. 22425-22167=258.

So 9 + 258/2463 ≈ 9 + ~0.1047≈9.1047 mol. So that part seems correct.

Wait, but then the mass equation is leading to a mole fraction x that's negative, which is impossible. So perhaps I messed up the equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this differently.

Wait, another approach: Let me let x be the mole fraction of butane. So, the average molar mass M_avg is given by M_avg = (1 - x) M_ethane + x M_butane.

Because the total mass is m = n_total * M_avg.

So, M_avg = m / n_total.

Compute M_avg: 0.3554 g / 9.104 mol ≈ 0.03906 g/mol? Wait, that can't be right. Because 0.3554 g is 355.4 mg, divided by 9.104 moles. But molar masses are around 30 g/mol, so M_avg can't be 0.039. That's way too low.

Wait, wait, wait a second. That makes no sense. If n_total is 9.104 mol, and the mass is 0.3554 g, then the average molar mass is 0.3554 / 9.104 ≈ 0.039 g/mol. Which is way too low. Because 1 mole of any gas is at least 2 g/mol (like hydrogen). So something is very wrong here.

Ah! Wait a minute. I think I made a mistake in the units of pressure. Because 97.5 ×10^3 Pa is 97.5 kPa, which is much lower than atmospheric pressure. Wait, but 1 atm is about 101.325 kPa. So 97.5 kPa is slightly less than 1 atm. So that part is correct.

Wait, but then the n_total is 9.104 mol in 0.23 L? That would mean the density is 0.3554 g / 0.23 L ≈1.545 g/L. Which seems low for gases, but possible.

Wait, but let's think: 9.104 moles, but the bulb is only 0.23 L. So the molar concentration is about 39.5 mol/L. At 0.96 atm and 296 K, that's plausible.

But the molar mass being 0.039 g/mol is impossible. That suggests that I made a mistake in the calculation of n_total. Because 9.104 moles in 0.23 L at 97.5 kPa and 296 K.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation of n_total.

n = (P V) / (R T)

P = 97,500 Pa.

V = 0.230 L.

But wait, R is 8.314 J/mol·K when using P in Pa, V in m³, etc. Wait, no, V is in liters here, which is 0.23 L. Wait, but 1 m³ is 1000 liters, so 0.23 L is 0.00023 m³.

Wait, wait no, perhaps I should have converted V to m³. Because when using R =8.314 J/mol·K, V must be in m³.

Ah! That's the mistake. I used V in liters, but R is in J/mol·K which uses V in m³.

So, correct approach: convert V from cm³ to m³.

230.0 cm³ is 230 mL, which is 0.23 L, which is 0.00023 m³.

So, V = 0.00023 m³.

So, let me recalculate n_total.

n = (P V) / (R T)

P = 97,500 Pa.

V= 0.00023 m³.

R =8.314 J/mol·K.

T=296.25 K.

Compute numerator: 97500 * 0.00023 = let's see.

97500 * 0.0002 = 19.5.

97500 * 0.00003 = 2.925.

Total: 19.5 +2.925=22.425 J.

Denominator: 8.314 *296.25 ≈ let's compute 8 *296.25=2370, 0.314*296.25≈93.0225. So total denominator is 2370+93.0225=2463.0225 J/mol.

So n_total = 22.425 /2463.0225 ≈ approx 0.0091 mol.

Wait, that makes more sense. Because 0.0091 mol in 0.23 L would have a much higher molar concentration, which makes sense at that pressure.

So, n_total is approximately 0.0091 mol.

Now, recalculate the average molar mass.

M_avg = mass / n_total = 0.3554 g / 0.0091 mol ≈ let's compute that.

0.3554 / 0.0091 ≈ 39.06 g/mol.

Ah! That makes sense now. Because 39 g/mol is between ethane (30) and butane (58).

So, now, M_avg = (1-x)*M_ethane + x*M_butane.

So,

39.06 = (1 - x)*30.068 + x*58.12.

Let me compute 58.12 -30.068 =28.052.

So,

39.06 =30.068 +28.052 x.

Subtract 30.068:

39.06 -30.068 =28.052 x => 8.992 =28.052 x.

So, x =8.992 /28.052 ≈ 0.3205, or 32.05%.

Looking at the options, option H is 32%.

To determine the mole percent of butane in the gas mixture, the following steps were taken:

1. **Convert the volume to SI units**:  
   The bulb's volume is given as \(230.0 \ \mathrm{cm}^3\), which is converted to \(0.00023 \ \mathrm{m}^3\).

2. **Calculate the total moles of gas using the ideal gas law**:  
   The ideal gas law is \(n_{\text{total}} = \frac{P V}{R T}\), where:  
   - \(P = 97,500 \ \mathrm{Pa}\),  
   - \(V = 0.00023 \ \mathrm{m}^3\),  
   - \(R = 8.314 \ \mathrm{J/mol \cdot K}\),  
   - \(T = 296.25 \ \mathrm{K}\).  

   Substituting these values:  
   \[
   n_{\text{total}} = \frac{(97,500)(0.00023)}{(8.314)(296.25)} \approx 0.0091 \ \mathrm{mol}.
   \]

3. **Determine the average molar mass of the gas mixture**:  
   The total mass of the gas is \(0.3554 \ \mathrm{g}\). The average molar mass \(M_{\text{avg}}\) is given by:  
   \[
   M_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\text{mass}}{n_{\text
