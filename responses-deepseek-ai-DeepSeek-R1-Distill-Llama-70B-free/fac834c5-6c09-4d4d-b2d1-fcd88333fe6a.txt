Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I get it right.

The question is about translating a proposition into English using a given key. The proposition is written in predicate logic, which is a bit intimidating at first, but I think I can break it down.

The proposition is: (∀x)[Ax ⊃ (∃y)(Hy • Bxy)]

The key provided is:
- Ax: x is an apartment
- Hx: x is a house
- Lx: x is large (though I don't see Lx used here)
- Bxy: x is bigger than y

So, the proposition is for all x, if x is an apartment, then there exists a y such that y is a house and x is bigger than y. Wait, no, the way it's written, Bxy would mean x is bigger than y. So, if Ax is "x is an apartment," then for every apartment x, there exists a house y where x is bigger than y.

Let me try to parse this more carefully. The structure is a universal quantifier followed by an implication. So for every x, if x is an apartment, then there's some y where y is a house and x is bigger than y.

In plain English, that would mean "For every apartment, there exists a house that the apartment is bigger than." Or, more naturally, "Every apartment is bigger than some house."

Now, looking at the options, I need to find which one matches this interpretation.

Option A: Some house is smaller than every apartment. Hmm, that sounds like it's saying there's at least one house that's smaller than every apartment. But our proposition is about every apartment being bigger than some house, not necessarily all.

Option B: Every house is bigger than some apartment. Wait, that's the opposite of what we have. Our proposition is about apartments being bigger than houses, not the other way around.

Option C: Some apartments are bigger than all houses. That would mean there exists an apartment that's bigger than every house, which is stronger than our proposition, which only requires each apartment to be bigger than at least one house.

Option D: Some apartments are smaller than all houses. That would mean there's at least one apartment that's smaller than every house, which doesn't seem to fit because our proposition says each apartment is bigger than some house, but doesn't say anything about all houses.

Option E: Some house is bigger than every apartment. This suggests there's a single house that's bigger than all apartments, which again isn't what our proposition states. Our proposition allows for each apartment to have its own house that it's bigger than.

Option F: Every apartment is bigger than some house. Yes, this matches exactly what I thought earlier. For every apartment, there's at least one house that it's bigger than.

Option G: All apartments are smaller than some house. Wait, that would mean every apartment is smaller than at least one house. That's the opposite of our proposition, which says apartments are bigger than some house.

Option H: Every apartment is smaller than some house. Again, this is the opposite. It's saying each apartment is smaller than some house, which contradicts our original meaning.

Option I: All houses are smaller than some apartment. This would mean every house is smaller than at least one apartment, which is not exactly what the proposition says. Our proposition is about each apartment being bigger than some house, not necessarily every house being smaller than some apartment.

Option J: Every house is bigger than all apartments. That's a strong statement implying all houses are bigger than every apartment, which is the opposite of our proposition.

So, after going through each option, the correct choice seems to be Option F: Every apartment is bigger than some house.

The proposition (∀x)[Ax ⊃ (∃y)(Hy • Bxy)] states that for every apartment (Ax), there exists a house (Hy) such that the apartment is bigger than the house (Bxy). In simpler terms, this means "Every apartment is bigger than some house."

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. It suggests a single house smaller than all apartments, which isn't implied.
- **B**: Incorrect. It reverses the relationship, stating houses are bigger than apartments.
- **C**: Incorrect. It claims some apartments are bigger than all houses, which is stronger than the proposition.
- **D**: Incorrect. It implies some apartments are smaller than all houses, contradicting the proposition.
- **E**: Incorrect. It suggests one house is bigger than all apartments, which isn't stated.
- **F**: Correct. It matches the proposition: "Every apartment is bigger than some house."
- **G**: Incorrect. It states apartments are smaller than some house, the opposite of the proposition.
- **H**: Incorrect. It also states apartments are smaller than some house, contradicting the proposition.
- **I**: Incorrect. It implies every house is smaller than some apartment, which isn't the focus of the proposition.
- **J**: Incorrect. It claims all houses are bigger than all apartments, the opposite of the proposition.

The best interpretation is **Option F: Every apartment is bigger than some house.**

Answer: F
