Question:

Which statement about absorption from the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract is most correct?


Options:

A: The absorption of glucose is associated with sodium uptake.
B: Fructose is absorbed more rapidly than glucose.
C: Galactose and fructose are absorbed by the same transporter at the brush border membrane.
D: Most water absorption along the GI tract occurs in the colon.

Okay, so I've got this question about absorption in the GI tract, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's see what each option says and try to recall what I know about this topic.

The question is asking which statement is most correct regarding absorption from the GI tract. The options are A to D.

Option A: The absorption of glucose is associated with sodium uptake. Hmm, I remember that glucose absorption in the small intestine is via a cotransporter with sodium ions. Sodium helps in the co-transport of glucose through the intestinal cells. So when sodium is absorbed, it brings glucose along with it. So this seems correct.

Option B: Fructose is absorbed more rapidly than glucose. Wait, I think glucose's absorption rate is actually higher than fructose. Glucose uses the sodium-glucose cotransporter which is efficient, whereas fructose uses a different transporter, maybe GLUT5, which is facilitated diffusion. So maybe B is incorrect because glucose is absorbed faster, not fructose.

Option C: Galactose and fructose are absorbed by the same transporter. I'm pretty sure that's not right. Galactose is absorbed along with glucose using the same sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT1), but fructose uses a different one. So C is probably false.

Option D: Most water absorption occurs in the colon. No, I think the majority of water absorption happens in the small intestine, specifically the jejunum. The colon might absorb some, especially in cases of diarrhea, but most happens earlier. So D is incorrect.

So thinking through, the correct answer should be A. Because glucose absorption is coupled with sodium uptake. That makes sense because the sodium gradient drives glucose into the cells. Fructose's absorption is slower and doesn't rely on sodium.

The correct answer is A: The absorption of glucose is associated with sodium uptake. This is because glucose is absorbed via the sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT1) in the small intestine, which relies on the sodium gradient to facilitate glucose uptake. Fructose, on the other hand, uses a different transporter (GLUT5) and is absorbed more slowly. Galactose is absorbed by the same transporter as glucose, not fructose, and most water absorption occurs in the small intestine, not the colon.
