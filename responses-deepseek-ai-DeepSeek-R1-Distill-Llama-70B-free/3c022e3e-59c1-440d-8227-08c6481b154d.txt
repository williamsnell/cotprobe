Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Hersey and Blanchard's Situational Leadership Model. Hmm, I remember from my management class that this model talks about different leadership styles based on the situation, particularly the maturity of the subordinates.

The question is asking about the Delegating Style. I think the model categorizes leadership into four styles: Telling, Selling, Participating, and Delegating. Each style varies in terms of task orientation and relationship orientation.

Task orientation is about focusing on the task, giving instructions, and making sure things get done. Relationship orientation is about building relationships, communicating, and supporting the team members.

So, the Delegating style must be when the leader does the least. I think when subordinates are highly mature, meaning they're competent and confident, the leader doesn't need to do much. So, the leader would delegate tasks and not be involved much in either the task details or in building relationships because the team can handle it on their own.

Wait, in the model, the Delegating style is low on both task and relationship orientation. Because the leader isn't actively directing the tasks (low task) and isn't providing much support or interaction (low relationship). So the leader just delegates and lets the team work independently.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that says low task and low relationship. Let me see the options:

Option E says low task and low relationship. That must be it. So the answer should be E.

The Delegating Style in Hersey and Blanchard's Situational Leadership Model is characterized by low task orientation and low relationship orientation. This style is applied when subordinates are highly mature, meaning they are both competent and confident, requiring minimal supervision and support. The leader delegates tasks and allows the team to work independently without active involvement in either task direction or relationship building.

E: low task orientation and low relationship orientation

Answer: E
