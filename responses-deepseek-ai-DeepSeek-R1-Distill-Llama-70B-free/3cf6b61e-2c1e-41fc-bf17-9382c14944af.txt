Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about androgyny in Bern's research. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Sandra Bem is a psychologist known for her work on gender roles. She introduced the Bem Sex-Role Inventory, which measures how people rate themselves on masculine, feminine, and androgynous traits. So the question is about what androgyny means in her research.

Androgyny, from what I recall, isn't about being neither male nor female or some disorder. It's more about having both masculine and feminine traits. So in Bem's work, an androgynous person would score high on both scales. They can exhibit traits traditionally seen as masculine, like assertiveness, and also those seen as feminine, like nurturance.

Looking at the options:

A: Psychological disorder. No, Bem didn't frame it that way. She saw it as a positive trait, not a disorder.

B: Sociological trend. Not specific to her research, more about society in general.

C: Characteristics of neither sex. No, that would be more like being undifferentiated or a different concept.

D: Fashion term. That's unrelated to psychological research.

E: Biological term. No, that's about plants or animals with both reproductive organs.

F: Characteristics of both sexes. This sounds right. Bem's androgyny is about having both sets of traits.

G: Clothing style. Again, fashion, not psychological.

H: Absence of gender identity. No, that's more about gender identity issues, not Bem's concept.

I: Gender-neutral personality. Maybe, but Bem's androgyny is about having both, not being neutral.

J: Genetics. Not related to her research.

So the correct answer should be F.

Androgyny in Sandra Bem's research refers to individuals who exhibit both masculine and feminine traits. This concept is part of her Bem Sex-Role Inventory, which assesses how individuals perceive themselves in terms of gender traits. Bem viewed androgyny as a positive trait where individuals can balance both traditional masculine and feminine characteristics.

The correct answer is F.

Answer: F
