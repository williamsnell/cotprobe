Okay, I've got this physics problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and figure out what it's asking.

The question is about telescopes and the fraction of the objective lens that's actually used. Hmm. I remember that telescopes have an objective lens and an eyepiece. The objective collects the light, and the eyepiece magnifies the image formed by the objective.

So the given data: the diameter of the objective lens is 30 mm. The angular magnification is 5x. The diameter of the pupil of the observer's eye is 5 mm. We need to find what fraction of the objective's area is utilized.

Wait, I think this has to do with the exit pupil of the telescope. Because the exit pupil determines how much light the observer's eye can take in. If the exit pupil is larger than the observer's eye pupil, then only part of the light is used, right?

Angular magnification (M) relates the exit pupil to the objective. There's a formula: M = D_objective / D_exit_pupil. Oh wait, is that right? Or is it the other way around? Let me think. The magnification is the ratio of the objective diameter to the exit pupil diameter. So M = D_obj / D_exit. So solving for D_exit, D_exit = D_obj / M.

Wait, no, I think it might be the formula: D_exit_pupil = D_objective / M. Yeah, that makes sense because a higher magnification would result in a smaller exit pupil. So plugging in the numbers: D_exit = 30 mm / 5 = 6 mm.

But wait, the observer's eye pupil is only 5 mm. So the exit pupil is 6 mm, but the eye can only take in 5 mm of it. So the area used is based on the smaller one, which is 5 mm.

But wait, the question is about the fraction of the objective's area that's used. So the objective's area is π*(30/2)^2 = π*(15)^2 = 225π mm². The exit pupil's diameter is 6 mm, so area is π*(3)^2=9π mm². But the eye can only use 5 mm diameter, so the area used is π*(2.5)^2=6.25π.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up concepts. Maybe the area utilized is the area of the objective that contributes to the image seen. But I'm a bit confused.

Another approach: The maximum amount of light that can enter the eye is determined by the pupil diameter. So the exit pupil's diameter determines how much of the telescope's light can be used. If the exit pupil is larger than the eye's pupil, then the eye's pupil limits the effective area.

Wait, but according to the formula, the exit pupil is D_exit = D_obj / M. So in this case, 30 mm /5 =6 mm. So the exit pupil is 6 mm. But the eye's pupil is only 5 mm. So the eye can only use a 5 mm diameter of the exit pupil.

So the area of the exit pupil that's used is π*(5/2)^2 = (25/4)π mm². The area of the objective is π*(30/2)^2 = 225π mm².

Wait, no. Wait, the exit pupil is the image of the objective formed by the eyepiece. So the actual area used would be the area of the exit pupil that fits into the eye's pupil. So the relevant area here is the area of the exit pupil, but since the eye's pupil is smaller, only part of that is used.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think again.

The exit pupil is the size of the light beam coming out of the telescope. If the exit pupil is larger than the eye's pupil, then the eye can only take in as much as its own pupil allows. So the effective area used is the area of the eye's pupil. But wait, the exit pupil's area is (D_exit/2)^2 π. And the eye's area is (5/2)^2 π.

But the question is about the fraction of the objective's area that's utilized. So the objective's area is π*(15)^2=225π. The exit pupil's area is π*(3)^2=9π. But since the eye can only use 5 mm, the used area is π*(2.5)^2=6.25π.

Wait, that approach doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the exit pupil area is the limit, but since the eye's pupil is smaller, the fraction is determined by the ratio of the areas of the eye's pupil area to the exit pupil's area. Or wait, maybe it's the ratio of the areas based on the diameters.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The fraction is (D_eye_pupil / D_exit_pupil)^2. Because area is proportional to diameter squared.

So D_exit_pupil is 6 mm. D_eye is 5 mm. So (5/6)^2 =25/36 ≈0.694, which is about 69.4%. Looking at the options, B is 70%, which is close. But wait, the options don't have 69.4%, but B is 70% which is the closest. But let me check if I did everything right.

Wait, but the exit pupil is 6 mm, and the eye's pupil is 5 mm. So the eye can only accept a circle of 5 mm diameter, so the area used is (5/6)^2 of the exit pupil's area. But the exit pupil's area is (6/2)^2 π =9π. So the used area is (25/36)*9π = (25/4)π.

But the objective's area is 225π. So the fraction is (25/4 π) / (225 π) = (25/4) /225 = (25)/(900) = 1/36 ≈0.0278, which is about 2.78%. That's way lower than any of the options. So that can't be right.

Hmm, I must be getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the area of the objective lens that is actually passing light to the eye. Since the exit pupil is the size of the light cone leaving the telescope, the eye can only accept up to its own pupil size. So the area of the objective that is used is determined by how much of the exit pupil is within the eye's pupil.

Wait, but the exit pupil is an image of the objective. So the size of the exit pupil determines how much of the objective is being used. Because if the exit pupil is larger than the eye's pupil, then only the central part of the objective is being used. Otherwise, all of it is used.

Wait, let me get this right. The exit pupil is the image of the objective lens as seen through the eyepiece. The size of the exit pupil determines the maximum diameter of light that can enter the eye. So if the exit pupil is smaller than or equal to the eye's pupil, then the entire objective is used. But if the exit pupil is larger, then only a part of the objective's light is used, determined by the ratio.

Wait, perhaps the area utilized of the objective is (D_exit / D_obj)^2. But if D_exit is larger than the eye's diameter, then the utilized area becomes (D_eye / D_obj)^2.

Wait, maybe. Let me think of it this way: the exit pupil's diameter is D_exit = D_obj / M. So in our case, 30/5=6 mm. But the eye's pupil is 5 mm. Therefore, the eye's pupil limits the exit pupil's diameter to 5 mm. So the utilized fraction of the objective's area is (5 / D_exit)^2. Wait, no, because the exit pupil is determined by the objective and eyepiece. So the actual used diameter is the minimum of exit pupil and eye pupil. So in this case, it's 5 mm.

So the area of the objective is π*(15)^2=225π mm². The area that's utilized is π*( (5/2) )^2 = (6.25)π mm².

So the fraction is 6.25π / 225π = 6.25/225 = (25/4)/225 = 25/(4*225) ) = 25/900 = 1/36 ≈0.0278 or 2.78%. But none of the options match that. So I must have done something wrong.

Wait, another approach: the area used is the area of the exit pupil that the eye can accept. The exit pupil is D_exit=6mm, but eye's diameter is 5mm. So the area used is the area of a circle with diameter 5mm, which is (5/2)^2 π=6.25π. The area of the exit pupil is (6/2)^2 π=9π. So the fraction of the exit pupil that's used is 6.25/9≈0.694 (69.4%). But the question is about the fraction of the objective's area that's used. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the exit pupil is an image of the objective. So the area of the exit pupil is (D_exit / D_obj)² times the area of the objective. Because the exit pupil is a scaled version of the objective. So the area of the exit pupil is (6/30)^2 * Area_obj = (1/5)^2 *225π= (1/25)*225π=9π mm², which matches the earlier calculation.

Now, the eye's pupil can only utilize 5mm diameter. So the area used is (5/2)^2 π=6.25π. So the fraction of the exit pupil's area that is used is 6.25π /9π=6.25/9≈0.694.

But the question is about the objective's area. So the exit pupil's area is 9π, which is (6/30)^2 *225π=9π. The used area is 6.25π, which is (5/6)^2 of the exit pupil area. So the fraction of the exit pupil's area used is (25/36)=0.694. But how does that relate to the objective's area?

Wait, the objective's entire area contributes to the exit pupil. So the exit pupil's area is (D_exit/D_obj)^2 * Area_obj. So (6/30)^2 *225π =9π. So the exit pupil is 9π, which is 1/25 of the objective's area.

But the eye's pupil only uses 6.25π of the exit pupil. So the fraction of the objective's area that's used is (6.25π)/(225π) )=6.25/225=0.02777, which is about 2.77%. That's not matching any options.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think differently.

Another approach: the magnification M is 5x. The formula that relates the exit pupil diameter to the objective is D_exit = D_obj / M. So 30/5=6 mm. But the eye's pupil is 5 mm. So the eye's pupil is smaller than the exit pupil. Therefore, only a portion of the exit pupil (and thus the objective) is used.

Wait, so the exit pupil is 6mm, but the eye can only accept 5mm. So the ratio of the eye's pupil to the exit pupil is 5/6. Since area scales with the square, the area ratio is (5/6)^2 ≈0.694.

But wait, the question is about the fraction of the objective's area used. The exit pupil's area is 9π mm², and the eye uses (5/6)^2 of that, which is 25/36 *9π= 225/36 π=6.25π. So the fraction of the objective's area used is 6.25π / 225π= 6.25/225= 0.02777, or ~2.78%. But the options don't have anything close to that.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's about the amount of light collected, which relates to the area. But the question specifically says "fraction of the area of the objective is actually utilized."

Wait, perhaps the exit pupil is the diameter that the eye can see. So the exit pupil diameter is D_exit= D_obj / M. So 30/5=6 mm. But the eye's pupil is 5 mm. So the maximum that can be used is 5 mm. So the fraction of the exit pupil that's used is (5/6)^2=25/36. But since the exit pupil is the image of the objective, the fraction of the objective's area used would be the same as the fraction of the exit pupil used, which is 25/36. Wait, that can't be because the exit pupil is a scaled version of the objective.

Alternatively, perhaps the area of the objective that is actually used is determined by the eye's pupil. So the area used is the area of the eye's pupil multiplied by (M)^2. Because the magnification scales things down. Wait, not sure.

Wait, another thought. The area of the objective is π*(15)^2=225π. The area that is used is the area that contributes to the image seen by the eye. The eye's pupil is 5 mm, so in terms of the telescope's exit pupil, which is 6 mm, the effective area is (5/6)^2 times the exit pupil's area.

But the exit pupil's area is 9π. So the used area is (25/36)*9π=225/36 π=6.25π. So the fraction is 6.25π /225π=1/36≈0.0277.

But in the options, the closest is not present. So perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, perhaps instead of area, it's about diameter. The fraction of the diameter used is 5/6, so area fraction is (5/6)^2=25/36≈69.4%. So the closest option is B:70%. But wait, why would the area fraction be based on exit pupil and eye's diameter?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the maximum diameter that the eye can use is 5 mm. The exit pupil is 6 mm, which is larger. So the telescope's exit pupil is larger than the eye's pupil, meaning the eye can't use all of the exit pupil. Therefore, the actual diameter used is 5 mm. The ratio of the areas is (5/6)^2≈69.4% of the exit pupil's area is used. But the exit pupil is (D_exit/D_obj)^2 * Area_obj. So the area used is (5/6)^2 * (6/30)^2 * Area_obj. Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, maybe it's better to think that the exit pupil is 6 mm. The eye's maximum is 5 mm. So the area that's used is the area corresponding to 5 mm. The exit pupil is an image of the objective. So the 5 mm in the exit pupil corresponds to (5 mm) * (D_obj/D_exit) =5*(30/6)=25 mm diameter on the objective. Because the magnification is inverse for the scaling.

Wait, that makes sense. The exit pupil is the image of the objective. So if the eye uses a 5 mm diameter in the exit pupil, that corresponds to a diameter on the objective of 5*(D_obj/D_exit) =5*(30/6)=25 mm.

But the objective's diameter is 30 mm. So the fraction of the area used is (25/30)^2= (5/6)^2=25/36≈69.4%. So the closest option is B, 70%. That seems to make sense.

So the correct approach is:

1. Find the exit pupil diameter: D_exit = D_obj / M =30/5=6 mm.
2. The eye's pupil is smaller (5 mm) than the exit pupil (6 mm), so only 5 mm is used.
3. The 5 mm exit pupil corresponds to a diameter on the objective of (5 mm) * (D_obj / D_exit) )=5*(30/6)=25 mm.
4. The area used is π*(25/2)^2= (625/4)π mm².
5. The total area of the objective is π*(15)^2=225π mm².
6. Fraction = (625/4 π) / (225 π) )=625/(4*225)=625/900=25/36≈0.694→69.4%, so answer B:70%.

To determine the fraction of the objective lens area that is actually utilized, we analyze the relationship between the telescope's exit pupil, the observer's eye pupil, and the objective lens.

1. **Calculate the exit pupil diameter**:  
   The exit pupil diameter is given by the formula:  
   \[
   D_{\text{exit}} = \frac{D_{\text{objective}}}{M}
   \]  
   Substituting the given values:  
   \[
   D_{\text{exit}} = \frac{30 \, \text{mm}}{5} = 6 \, \text{mm}.
   \]  

2. **Compare the exit pupil to the eye's pupil**:  
   The observer's eye pupil is 5 mm, which is smaller than the exit pupil (6 mm). Therefore, the eye's pupil limits the fraction of the exit pupil that is utilized.  

3. **Determine the fraction of the exit pupil used**:  
   The fraction of the exit pupil's area that is utilized is proportional to the square of the ratio of the eye's pupil diameter to the exit pupil diameter:  
   \[
   \text{Fraction of exit pupil used} = \left(\frac{D_{\text{eye}}}{D_{\text{exit}}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^2 = \frac{25}{36} \approx 0.694 \, (69.4\%).
   \]  

4. **Relate the exit pupil to the objective lens**:  
   The exit pupil is an image of the objective lens, scaled by the magnification. The area of the exit pupil is proportional to the area of the objective lens:  
   \[
   \text{Fraction of objective area used} = \text{Fraction of exit pupil used}.
   \]  

Thus, the fraction of the objective lens area that is actually utilized is approximately **69.4%**, which corresponds to the closest option, **70%**.
