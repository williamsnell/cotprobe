Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a Galilean telescope. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on telescopes, but let me try to think it through. Alright, the question gives the refractive powers of the front and back lenses. The front lens is +10.00 diopters and the back is -12.50 diopters. Wait, diopters are the reciprocal of focal length in meters, right? So power is 1/f, so f = 1/power.

Galilean telescopes are afocal, which I remember means that the combination of the two lenses makes the system act like a telescope without any focal length. So the object is at the focal point of the objective lens, and the image is at the focal point of the eyepiece. So the separation between the lenses should be the sum of their focal lengths, because the first lens forms an image at its focal point, and the second lens, which is negative, would have its focal point on the same side, I think.

Wait, the front lens is positive, so it's a convex lens, and the back is negative, so a concave lens. The Galilean telescope uses a convex objective and a concave eyepiece. Right.

So first, I'll find the focal lengths of each lens. The front (objective) has f1 = 1/10 m, which is 0.1 meters or 10 cm. The back (eyepiece) has f2 = 1/(-12.50) diopters, so f2 is -0.08 meters or -8 cm. The negative sign indicates that the focal point is on the same side as the incoming light for a concave lens.

Wait, but in a Galilean telescope, the eyepiece is a diverging lens. So the separation between the two lenses is the sum of their focal lengths. Because the objective forms an image at its focal point, and the eyepiece is placed so that this image is at its focal point. So the distance between them is f1 + |f2|, right? Because f2 is negative.

So f1 is 10 cm, f2 is -8 cm, so the separation should be 10 + 8 = 18 cm? Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have 18 cm. Hmm, did I mess up?

Wait, wait. Wait, wait a minute. Maybe I got the formula wrong. Oh, right, the separation between the lenses in an afocal telescope is actually the sum of the focal lengths, but taking into account their signs? Or just the magnitudes? Because when you have two lenses, the separation is f1 + f2. But since f2 is negative, adding them would give 10 + (-8) = 2 cm. Oh, wait, that makes sense.

Wait, but why? Because the eyepiece is a diverging lens, the focal points are in opposite directions. So the distance between the lenses is f1 (from the first lens) plus |f2| (because the eyepiece's focal length is on the same side as the objective's). Wait, maybe I'm confusing the setup. Let me think again.

In a Galilean telescope, the objective has a longer focal length than the eyepiece. The eyepiece is placed between the focal point of the objective and the objective itself. Wait, no. No, the eyepiece is placed so that the image formed by the objective is at the eyepiece's focal point. So the distance between the two lenses should be f1 (objective) plus |f2| (eyepiece), because the eyepiece is a diverging lens, so its focal length is negative, but the physical distance is just the magnitude.

Wait, so if f1 is 10 cm and f2 is -8 cm, then the separation is 10 cm + 8 cm = 18 cm. But none of the options have 18 cm. So I must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the afocal condition. The afocal condition is when the image formed by the first lens is at the focal point of the second. So the separation between the lenses (distance between the two) is f1 + f2. Since f1 is positive and f2 is negative, 10 cm + (-8 cm) = 2 cm. So separation is 2 cm.

So that would make the separation 2 cm, which is option A or H, let's see. Let me check the options. Option A is 2cm, angular magnification -2. Option H is 2cm, -1.25.

Wait, but what about the angular magnification? The angular magnification M is given by (f1)/(f2), but considering signs. Wait, no. The formula for the magnification of a Galilean telescope is -(f1)/(f2), because the eyepiece is a diverging lens. Wait, I'm getting confused here.

Wait, the magnification for a Keplerian telescope is M = f_objective / f_eyepiece. But for Galilean, which uses a diverging eyepiece, the formula is M = f1/f2. But since f2 is negative, it would be a negative value, indicating inverted image.

Wait, let me get this straight. The magnification M is given by M = (f1) / (f2). Since f1 is 10 cm, f2 is -8 cm, so M = (10) / (-8) = -1.25. So the angular magnification is -1.25, which means it's inverted and the magnification is 1.25 times.

Wait, but some sources say that for a Galilean telescope, the magnification is |f1/f2|. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, another formula I've seen is M = (f_objective) / (f_eyepiece). Since in this case, f_eyepiece is negative, the magnification would be negative, meaning the image is inverted.

So in this case, M = 10 / (-8) = -1.25. So the options are looking for separation and magnification.

So separation is 2 cm (from 10 + (-8) = 2 cm), and magnification is -1.25. Looking at the options, which one has 2 cm and -1.25? Option H is 2cm, -1.25. So that must be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. The afocal condition requires that the image from the first lens is at the focal point of the second. So the distance between lenses is f1 + f2. So 10 + (-8) = 2 cm. Yep, that's right.

So the separation is 2 cm, and magnification is -1.25. So the correct option is H.

The problem involves a Galilean-type telescope with a front lens of +10.00 diopters and a back lens of -12.50 diopters. The goal is to determine the separation between the lenses for the system to be afocal and calculate the angular magnification.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Focal Lengths**:  
   The focal length of a lens is the reciprocal of its power.  
   - For the front lens (objective):  
     \[
     f_1 = \frac{1}{10.00} = 0.1 \, \text{m} = 10 \, \text{cm}
     \]  
   - For the back lens (eyepiece):  
     \[
     f_2 = \frac{1}{-12.50} = -0.08 \, \text{m} = -8 \, \text{cm}
     \]  
     The negative sign indicates that the eyepiece is a diverging lens.

2. **Afocal Condition**:  
   For a Galilean telescope to be afocal, the separation between the two lenses is given by:  
   \[
   \text{Separation} = f_1 + f_2
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   \text{Separation} = 10 \, \text{cm} + (-8 \, \text{cm}) = 2 \, \text{cm}
   \]

3. **Angular Magnification**:  
   The angular magnification \( M \) of a Galilean telescope is given by:  
   \[
   M = -\frac{f_1}{f_2}
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   M = -\frac{10}{-8} = -1.25
   \]  
   The negative sign indicates that the image is inverted.

### Final Answer:
The separation between the lenses is **2 cm**, and the angular magnification is **-1.25**. Comparing these results with the options provided, the correct choice is:

**H: 2 cm, -1.25**

H
