Okay, so I've got this transformer problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The transformer is 4,400 volts, 60 cycles. The core loss is 840 watts, and one-third of that is eddy-current loss. So, core loss is made up of two parts: hysteresis loss and eddy-current loss. I remember that hysteresis loss depends on the frequency and the voltage, while eddy-current loss depends on the square of the voltage and the frequency squared as well.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get that right. So, I think the hysteresis loss (W_h) is proportional to the frequency (f) times the voltage squared (V²). Or is it just V squared? Hmm. Or maybe it's proportional to the frequency. And eddy-current loss (W_e) is proportional to the square of the frequency and the square of the voltage. Because eddy currents are induced by changing magnetic fields, so higher frequency would mean more loss.

Wait, another thought: The total core loss (P_core) is the sum of hysteresis and eddy losses. So P_core = W_h + W_e. Given that W_e is one-third of the total core loss, that means W_h is two-thirds. Because one-third is eddy, so 840*(1/3) is 280 watts for eddy, and 840-280=560 watts for hysteresis.

So initially, at 4,400 volts and 60 Hz, W_h is 560 W and W_e is 280 W.

Now, the question asks for the core loss when the transformer is connected under different conditions:

(a) 4,600 V, 60 Hz
(b) 4,400 V, 50 Hz
(c) 4,600 V, 50 Hz

So for each case, we need to calculate the new W_h and W_e, then sum them for total core loss.

Let me think about how each loss component scales with voltage and frequency.

Hysteresis loss (W_h): I think it's proportional to the frequency (f) times the square of the voltage (V²). Wait, no, wait. Wait, I might be mixing things up. Let me recall the formulas.

Hysteresis loss is given by W_h = k_h * f * V², where k_h is a constant. Eddy current loss is W_e = k_e * (f²) * (V)². Or is V involved? Maybe it's just W_e proportional to f² times something else.

Wait, another approach. Since the transformer's core loss depends on voltage and frequency, and each component scales differently.

At the initial condition, V1 = 4400 V, f1 = 60 Hz.

So,

W_h1 = k_h * f1 * (V1)^2

W_e1 = k_e * (f1)^2 * (V1)^2

Wait, I'm not sure if that's exactly right. Alternatively, I think that hysteresis loss is proportional to f * V², and eddy loss is proportional to f² * V². So both depend on V squared, but frequency factors differ.

So, given that, for each scenario, we can find the scaling factors for W_h and W_e.

So for part (a): V increases to 4600 V, same frequency 60 Hz.

So, the new W_h will be (since V increases and f stays same):

W_h2 = W_h1 * (V2/V1)^2.

Same for W_e2 = W_e1 * (V2/V1)^2 * (f2/f1)^2.

Wait, but f2 is same as f1 in case (a). So f2/f1=1, so W_e2 = W_e1 * (V2/V1)^2.

Wait, but let's compute the scaling factors.

In (a):

V goes from 4400 to 4600. So (4600/4400)^2 = (23/22)^2 ≈ (1.04545)^2 ≈ 1.0928.

So W_h increases by factor of 1.0928, and same for W_e.

So W_h2 = 560 * 1.0928 ≈ 560 * 1.0928. Let's compute that.

560 * 1.0928: 560 * 1 = 560, 560 * 0.0928≈ 52. So total ≈ 612 W.

Similarly, W_e2 = 280 * 1.0928 ≈ 280 * 1.0928. 280 * 1=280, 280 * 0.0928≈26. So 280+26=306 W.

So total core loss P = 612 + 306 = 918 W. But wait, maybe I should calculate more accurately.

Wait, 4600/4400 = 1.04545... Squared is about 1.0928 as I had.

560 * 1.0928 = 560*(1 + 0.0928) = 560 + (560 * 0.0928)

560 * 0.0928: let's compute 560 * 0.09 = 50.4, 560 * 0.0028=1.568. So total 50.4+1.568=51.968. So 560 + 51.968=611.968 ~612 W.

Same for 280 * 1.0928: 280 * 0.0928 = approx 26. So 280 +26=306.

612 +306 = 918 W. Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see 918 as an option. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are all in the 800s and 900s. Let me look. The options are (a), (b), (c) in each option.

Looking at the options, for example, option E is (910, 890,950). So for (a), the first value is around 910.

Wait, perhaps my calculation is a bit off because I approximated. Let me compute (4600/4400)^2 more accurately.

4400 squared: 4400^2 = (44)^2 * 100^2 = 1936 * 10,000=19,360,000.

4600^2: (46)^2 * 100^2 = 2116 * 10,000=21,160,000.

So (4600/4400)^2 = 21160000 / 19360000 = 2116 / 1936 ≈ 1.09280.

So that part is correct.

Wait, let's compute 560 * 1.0928 exactly.

560 * 1.0928 = 560 * (1 + 0.0928) = 560 + 560*0.0928.

Compute 560 * 0.09 = 50.4.

560 * 0.0028 = 1.568.

Total: 50.4 +1.568=51.968.

So 560 +51.968=611.968, which is approximately 612.

Same for 280 *1.0928 = 280 + 280*0.0928.

280 *0.09=25.2; 280*0.0028=0.784.

So 25.2 +0.784=25.984.

So 280 +25.984=305.984 ≈306.

612 +306=918. So approximately 918 W. But none of the options have exactly 918. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option H is (920, 870,960). So part (a) would be 920. Close to my 918. Maybe I should carry more precise numbers.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (4600/4400) exactly.

4600/4400 = 46/44 = 23/22 ≈1.0454545.

So (23/22)^2 = (529)/(484) ≈1.0928008.

So 560 * 529/484 = (560 *529) /484.

Wait, 560 *529 = let's compute: 500*529=264500; 60*529=31740. Total 264500+31740=296240.

Divide by 484: 296240 /484.

Let me compute 484 × 611 = ?

Well, 484 ×600=290,400.

484 ×11=5,324.

So 290,400 +5,324=295,724. But 296,240 is 516 more.

So 611 + (516/484) ≈611 +1.066=612.066.

So approximately 612.066 W.

Similarly, W_e2=280*(529/484) = (280 *529)/484.

Compute 280 ×529: 200×529=105,800; 80×529=42,320. Sum: 105,800 +42,320=148,120.

Divide by 484: 148120 /484.

Well, 484 ×306= ?

484 ×300=145,200.

484 ×6=2,904.

Total 145,200 +2,904=148,104.

So 148,120 -148,104=16.

So 306 + 16/484 ≈306.033.

So W_e2≈306.033 W.

So total P =612.066 +306.033≈918.099 W, which is ~918 W.

Looking at the options, the closest is option H: 920, 870, 960.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake because the initial assumption is that W_h is proportional to f * V² and W_e proportional to f² * V².

But wait, another thought: I think I might have mixed up the dependencies. Let me double-check.

Hysteresis loss (W_h) is approximately proportional to the frequency (f) and the square of the maximum flux density, which in a transformer is proportional to V/f. Because flux is proportional to V/(f*N), but for a given transformer, N is fixed. So, V is proportional to f * flux. So if V increases and f changes, the flux would change as V/(f). So hysteresis loss, which depends on flux, would be proportional to (V/(f))² * f. So, overall, W_h is proportional to V² * f / f squared? Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, I remember that for core loss, the hysteresis loss is proportional to f*(V)^2/(f)^2) ? No, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of how V and f affect the core loss components.

Another approach: For a transformer, when you change the voltage and frequency, the core loss will change based on how each component scales.

Hysteresis loss scales with frequency and the square of the voltage. Wait, no, because the hysteresis loss is due to the B-H loop, so it's proportional to the area of the loop, which depends on the peak flux density. The peak flux density is proportional to V/(f*N), assuming turns N is same. So, when you increase V and/or decrease f, the flux increases, which increases hysteresis loss.

Wait, but when V and f change, the flux density changes. So the formula might be more accurately represented as:

Hysteresis loss (W_h) ∝ f * (V/(f))² → which simplifies to W_h ∝ V² / f.

Wait, that would mean that if f increases, for a given V, W_h decreases. But that doesn't make sense because higher frequency should cause higher hysteresis loss because of more cycles.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing. Let me get the exact dependence.

From what I recall, the hysteresis loss is given by W_h = k_h * f * (V)^2, where k_h is a constant that depends on the core material. Eddy current loss is W_e = k_e * (f^2) * (V)^2, with k_e being another constant.

Wait, no, that can't be, because if that's the case, then when you double the frequency, W_h doubles, and W_e quadruples. But if V is kept the same, then that's the case.

But in our problem, when voltage changes, it's a different situation.

Wait, perhaps the correct expressions are:

Hysteresis loss (W_h) is proportional to f * (V)^2 / (f_0)^2, where f_0 is the original frequency? No, that might not be right. Alternatively, perhaps the initial W_h and W_e are given, and we can find proportionality.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think in terms of per unit.

At the original condition, we have:

W_h1 = (2/3)*840 = 560 W

W_e1 = (1/3)*840 = 280 W

So, when conditions change, we can find the new W_h and W_e by scaling.

The key is to find how each component scales with voltage and frequency.

For hysteresis loss, W_h ∝ f * (V)^2.

Eddy current loss, W_e ∝ f² * (V)^2.

Wait, no, I think it's the other way around. Let me think: Hysteresis loss is due to the B-H loop and is proportional to the area of the loop, which is proportional to (B_max)^2 * f. Because as frequency increases, you have more cycles, each contributing the same area loss.

But B_max is proportional to V/(f*N), so substituting that in:

W_h ∝ f * (V/(f))^2 → W_h ∝ V²/(f).

Wait, that seems counterintuitive. If frequency increases, W_h would decrease, which doesn't make sense because higher frequency should lead to higher core losses.

Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing the two. Let me check a reference.

[Imagining I'm looking it up.]

According to some sources, hysteresis loss is proportional to the frequency and the square of the flux density. Flux density B is proportional to V/(f*N). So:

W_h = k_h * f * (B)^2.

Since B = V/(f*N), substituting:

W_h = k_h * f * (V/(f*N))² = k_h * (V²)/(f * N²)

But since N is the number of turns and remains constant, W_h ∝ V²/(f).

Similarly, eddy current loss is proportional to the square of the flux density and the square of the frequency:

W_e = k_e * (B)^2 * f².

Substituting B = V/(f*N):

W_e = k_e * (V²/(f² N²)) * f² = k_e * V²/(N²).

Wait, that can't be right because then W_e would be independent of frequency, which contradicts what I know.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me try again.

Eddy current loss is given by W_e = (k_e) * (f²) * (B_p)^2, where B_p is the peak flux density.

But B_p is proportional to (V)/(f*N), so:

W_e = k_e * f² * (V/(f*N))² = k_e * f² * V²/(f² N²) )= k_e * V²/(N²).

Wait, so that suggests W_e is proportional to V squared, independent of frequency. But that's not correct because eddy losses should increase with frequency squared.

Hmm, I'm getting confused here. Let me think differently.

Alternative approach: Since for the initial condition, we have W_h = 560 W, W_e = 280 W.

Now, when voltage and/or frequency changes, we can express the new W_h and W_e as:

W_h2 = W_h1 * (V2/V1)^2 * (f2/f1)

Wait, no, because earlier I thought W_h ∝ f * V². So W_h2 = W_h1 * (f2/f1) * (V2/V1)^2.

Same for W_e2 = W_e1 * (f2/f1)^2 * (V2/V1)^2.

Wait, that makes sense because if f increases and V stays same, W_h would increase linearly with f, and W_e would increase with f squared.

Yes, that makes more sense.

So for hysteresis loss, W_h ∝ f * V².

Eddy loss, W_e ∝ f² * V².

So, for part (a):

V2 = 4600 V, f2 =60 Hz.

So,

W_h2 = W_h1 * (f2/f1) * (V2/V1)^2.

f2/f1 =60/60=1.

V2/V1=4600/4400=1.04545.

So,

W_h2 =560 * 1 * (1.04545)^2.

(1.04545)^2 ≈1.0928.

So 560 *1.0928≈612 W.

Similarly,

W_e2 = W_e1 * (f2/f1)^2 * (V2/V1)^2 = 280 * 1^2 * (1.0928) ≈280 *1.0928 ≈306 W.

So total P =612 +306=918 W.

Looking back at the options, let's see which option starts with approximately 918 for part (a). Looking at the options:

Option H: (920, 870, 960)

So part (a) would be 920 W.

That's very close to our calculation of 918, so option H is a candidate.

Now, moving to part (b): 4,400 V, 50 Hz.

So V2=4400 V (same as before), f2=50 Hz.

Compute W_h2 and W_e2.

W_h2 = W_h1 * (f2/f1) * (V2/V1)^2.

f2/f1=50/60≈0.8333.

V2/V1=4400/4400=1. So,

W_h2 =560 * 0.8333 *1 =560 *0.8333≈466.67 W.

Wait, but that seems lower than initial. Hmm.

W_e2 = W_e1 * (f2/f1)^2 * (V2/V1)^2 =280 * (50/60)^2 *1.

(50/60)^2 = (5/6)^2 ≈0.6944.

So 280 *0.6944≈194.03 W.

Wait, but that can't be right because when frequency decreases, eddy current loss
