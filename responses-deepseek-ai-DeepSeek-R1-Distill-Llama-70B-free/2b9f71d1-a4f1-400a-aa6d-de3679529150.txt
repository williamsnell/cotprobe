Okay, so I've got this question about stagflation in the early 1970s and I need to figure out the right answer. Hmm, I remember that stagflation is a combination of high inflation and high unemployment, which is unusual because normally when inflation is high, unemployment is low, and vice versa. So what causes that?

I think the 1970s had some specific events. Oh right, there was an oil crisis. I remember something about oil prices shooting up. That must have contributed to inflation because oil is used in so many things, like transportation and production. So higher oil prices would make goods more expensive, leading to inflation. But how does that cause stagflation?

Wait, when oil prices go up, it can lead to higher production costs, which might make businesses produce less or lay off workers, increasing unemployment. So that's both inflation and unemployment together. That makes sense.

Also, I think there were some policy mistakes. Maybe the government's macroeconomic policies weren't handling the situation well. Like, maybe they tried to stimulate the economy in a way that didn't work, or perhaps they tightened money supply too much, making things worse.

Oh, and I remember something about taxes. The tax systems might have been set up in a way that made things worse. Like, if taxes are based on nominal income, higher inflation could push people into higher tax brackets without their real income increasing, which is called bracket creep. That would take more money out of people's pockets, reducing their spending power and maybe leading to less demand and higher unemployment.

So putting it all together, the causes were probably a mix of things like rapid price increases, oil price hikes, tax systems that made things worse, and policy mistakes. Let me look at the options.

Option B says: Rapid acceleration of price level, oil price increases, perversely working tax systems, and macroeconomic policy mistakes. That sounds exactly like what I was thinking.

Other options don't fit as well. Option C is about lowering oil prices, which would be the opposite. Option A says decrease in unemployment, which wouldn't explain the stagflation. Option D talks about expansion of international trade, which usually helps, not hurts. Option E about gold standard doesn't seem right. F and G are about production and technology, which might lower costs, not increase inflation. H is about stable exchange rates, which I don't think was a cause. I and J are about economic expansion and government spending reduction, which don't directly tie into the stagflation causes I remember.

The correct answer is B. In the early 1970s, stagflation was caused by a combination of factors including rapid price increases, oil price hikes, tax systems that exacerbated the situation (such as bracket creep), and macroeconomic policy mistakes. These elements led to high inflation and high unemployment simultaneously.

Answer: B
