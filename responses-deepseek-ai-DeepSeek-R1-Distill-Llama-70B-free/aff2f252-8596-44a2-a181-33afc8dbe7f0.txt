Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the median of Brian's team quiz scores. The scores are: 8, 6, 9, 7, 10, 9, 5, 4, 9. Hmm, I remember that the median is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in order. But wait, let me think through the steps properly.

First, I think I should list the numbers in order from smallest to largest. Let me write them down again to make sure I have them right: 8, 6, 9, 7, 10, 9, 5, 4, 9. So, arranging them in order... Let's see.

Starting with the smallest, I know 4 is the smallest. Then 5 comes next. After that, 6. Then 7, right? Then 8. Now, the next numbers are all 9s. There are three 9s. And the last one is 10.

So the ordered list should be: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9, 9, 10. Let me count them to make sure I have all nine numbers. Yes, that's 9 numbers.

Now, since there are nine numbers, which is an odd count, the median will be the middle one. The position can be found using the formula (n+1)/2, where n is the number of observations. So n here is 9, so (9+1)/2 is 10/2=5. So the fifth number is the median.

Looking at the ordered list: position 1 is 4, 2 is 5, 3 is 6, 4 is7, 5 is8. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Did I count that right? Let me list them with their positions:

1:4, 2:5, 3:6, 4:7, 5:8, 6:9, 7:9, 8:9, 9:10.

Oh wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake when I was ordering. Let me recount. The original numbers are 8,6,9,7,10,9,5,4,9.

So putting them in order:

Start with 4, then 5, 6, 7, 8, then the 9s. Wait, how many 9s are there? Let's see: in the original list, there's a 9, another 9, and another 9. So three 9s. So after 8, the next numbers are 9,9,9, and then 10.

So the correct order is: 4,5,6,7,8,9,9,9,10.

So position 1:4, 2:5,3:6,4:7,5:8,6:9,7:9,8:9,9:10.

So the fifth position is 8. That would make the median 8. But wait, let me double-check.

Wait, another way to think: when the numbers are ordered, the median is the middle value. Since there are nine numbers, the fifth one is the median. So yes, fifth is 8.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option D is 8. So the answer should be D.

Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in ordering. Let me list the numbers again:

Original:8,6,9,7,10,9,5,4,9.

Arrange in order:4,5,6,7,8,9,9,9,10.

Yes, that's correct. So position 5 is 8. So median is 8, which is option D.

The scores of Brian's team on the quiz are: 8, 6, 9, 7, 10, 9, 5, 4, 9. To find the median, the scores must be arranged in ascending order: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9, 9, 10. Since there are 9 scores (an odd number), the median is the middle value, which is the 5th number in the ordered list. The 5th number is 8. Therefore, the median is 8.

From the given options, the correct answer is D: 8.
