Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem. So, the question is about finding out how much CO₂ and H₂O are produced when burning 104 grams of C₂H₂. The reaction given is 2C₂H₂ + 5O₂ → 4CO₂ + 2H₂O. I remember that when dealing with stoichiometry problems, the key is to use the balanced equation to convert between masses and moles.

First, I think I should find the molar mass of C₂H₂. Carbon is about 12 g/mol and hydrogen is 1 g/mol. So C₂H₂ has 2*12 + 2*1 = 24 + 2 = 26 g/mol. 

The given mass is 104 grams. To find moles, I'll divide by the molar mass. 104 g / 26 g/mol = 4 moles of C₂H₂. 

Looking at the balanced equation, the mole ratio of C₂H₂ to CO₂ is 2:4, which simplifies to 1:2. So for every mole of C₂H₂, 2 moles of CO₂ are produced. Since I have 4 moles of C₂H₂, that should produce 4 * 2 = 8 moles of CO₂. 

Wait, no, actually, let me double-check. The equation says 2 moles of C₂H₂ produce 4 moles of CO₂. So the ratio is 2:4 = 1:2. So yes, 4 moles C₂H₂ gives 8 moles CO₂. 

The molar mass of CO₂ is given as 44 g/mol. So 8 moles * 44 g/mol = 352 grams of CO₂. Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see 352 as an option for CO₂. Wait, let me check the options again. Oh, option C is 352 CO₂ and 72 H₂O. But wait, let me calculate H₂O as well.

H₂O's mole ratio: for every 2 moles of C₂H₂, we get 2 moles of H₂O. So 4 moles of C₂H₂ would produce (2/2)*2 = 4 moles of H₂O? Wait, no. Let's see. The equation is 2 C₂H₂ → ... 2 H₂O. So for 2 moles, you get 2 moles H₂O. So the ratio is 1:1. Therefore, 4 moles of C₂H₂ would produce 4 moles of H₂O. 

Wait, no, wait. Because 2 C₂H₂ gives 2 H₂O. So it's 2:2, which is 1:1. So yes, 4 moles C₂H₂ → 4 moles H₂O. 

The molar mass of H₂O is 18 g/mol. So 4 moles *18 =72 grams. So CO₂ is 352g, H₂O is72g. Looking back at the options, option C is exactly that. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.

Wait, wait another thing. The initial moles of C₂H₂: 104 g / 26 g/mol = 4 moles. That's correct. Then, 2 C₂H₂ gives 4 CO₂, so per mole of C₂H₂, 2 moles CO₂. So 4 *2=8 moles CO₂. 8 *44=352g. For H₂O, 2 moles C₂H₂ give 2 moles H₂O, so 2/2 =1 per mole. So 4 *1=4 moles H₂O. 4 *18=72g. So yes, that's correct.

Looking at the options, option C is 352g CO₂ and 72g H₂O. So the answer should be option C. But wait, let me check the options again.

Wait, actually, let me recount the options.

Option C: 352 g CO₂ and 72 g H₂O. Yep, that's what I calculated. So the correct answer is C.

To determine the weights of CO₂ and H₂O produced when burning 104 g of C₂H₂, we use stoichiometry based on the balanced reaction:  
**2C₂H₂ + 5O₂ → 4CO₂ + 2H₂O**.  

1. **Calculate moles of C₂H₂**:  
   The molar mass of C₂H₂ is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Molar mass of C₂H₂} = (2 \times 12) + (2 \times 1) = 26 \, \text{g/mol}.
   \]  
   The number of moles of C₂H₂ is:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of C₂H₂} = \frac{\text{Mass of C₂H₂}}{\text{Molar mass of C₂H₂}} = \frac{104}{26} = 4 \, \text{moles}.
   \]

2. **Determine moles of CO₂ produced**:  
   From the balanced equation, 2 moles of C₂H₂ produce 4 moles of CO₂. Thus, the mole ratio is \( 2:4 = 1:2 \).  
   For 4 moles of C₂H₂:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of CO₂} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \, \text{moles}.
   \]  
   The molar mass of CO₂ is given as 44 g/mol. Therefore, the mass of CO₂ is:  
   \[
   \text{Mass of CO₂} = 8 \times 44 = 352 \, \text{g}.
   \]

3. **Determine moles of H₂O produced**:  
   From the balanced equation, 2 moles of C₂H₂ produce 2 moles of H₂O. Thus, the mole ratio is \( 2:2 = 1:1 \).  
   For 4 moles of C₂H₂:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of H₂O} = 4 \times 1 = 4 \, \text{moles}.
   \]  
   The molar mass of H₂O is given as 18 g/mol. Therefore, the mass of H₂O is:  
   \[
   \text{Mass of H₂O} = 4 \times 18 = 72 \, \text{g}.
   \]

4. **Compare with the options**:  
   The calculated masses are 352 g of CO₂ and 72 g of H₂O, which match **Option C**.

**Answer: C**
