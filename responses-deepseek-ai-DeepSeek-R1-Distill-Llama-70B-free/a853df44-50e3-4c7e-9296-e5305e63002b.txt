Okay, let's try to figure out how much Mr. Williams receives in dividends. So, he owns two types of stocks: common and preferred. I remember that dividends for common stock are usually based on the company's earnings, while preferred dividends are fixed.

Wait, the question says the common stock pays a dividend of $0.35 per share. So for the common stock, I just multiply the number of shares by the dividend per share. He has 75 shares. So 75 times 0.35. Let me calculate that: 75 * 0.35. Hmm, 70*0.35 is 24.5, and 5*0.35 is 1.75, so together that's 26.25. So that's $26.25 from common stock.

Now, the preferred stock part. He has 135 shares of 5% $50 par-value preferred stock. I think the dividend for preferred is calculated based on the par value and the percentage. So the formula should be number of shares multiplied by par value multiplied by the dividend rate. Or wait, maybe it's (par value * dividend rate) per share, then multiplied by the number of shares.

Right, so for each share of preferred, the dividend is 5% of $50. So 5% of 50 is 0.05 * 50 = $2.50 per share. He has 135 shares, so 135 * 2.50. Let me do that math. 100 shares would be 250, 35 shares would be 35 *2.50 = 87.50. So total from preferred is 250 +87.50 = $337.50.

Now add both amounts together. The common gives $26.25 and preferred gives $337.50. So 26.25 +337.50 equals 363.75. Let me check the options: option H is $363.75. So the answer should be H.

Wait, did I do everything right? Let me double-check. Common: 75 * 0.35: 75 *0.3 is 22.5, 75*0.05 is 3.75, total 26.25. Correct. Preferred: 5% of 50 is 2.5 per share. 135 *2.5. 100*2.5=250, 35*2.5=87.5, sum 337.5. Yes. Total 26.25 +337.5=363.75. So yeah, option H.

To determine the total dividends Mr. Williams receives, we calculate the dividends from both the common stock and the preferred stock separately and then sum them.

1. **Common Stock Dividends**:  
   Mr. Williams owns 75 shares of common stock, with a dividend of $0.35 per share.  
   \[
   \text{Dividends from common stock} = 75 \times 0.35 = 26.25
   \]

2. **Preferred Stock Dividends**:  
   He owns 135 shares of 5% $50 par-value preferred stock. The dividend per share is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Dividend per share} = 0.05 \times 50 = 2.50
   \]  
   Total dividends from preferred stock:  
   \[
   \text{Dividends from preferred stock} = 135 \times 2.50 = 337.50
   \]

3. **Total Dividends**:  
   Adding the dividends from both types of stock:  
   \[
   \text{Total dividends} = 26.25 + 337.50 = 363.75
   \]

The correct answer is **H: $363.75**.
