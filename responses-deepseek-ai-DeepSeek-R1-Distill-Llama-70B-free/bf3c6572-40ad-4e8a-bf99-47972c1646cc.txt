Question:

A state's constitution reserves to the people of each municipality in the state the power of referendum with respect to all questions that the municipality is authorized to control by legislation. A real estate developer applied for a zoning change to permit construction of a water park on land he owned in a city within the state. While the application was pending, the city's charter was amended by popular vote so as to require that any changes in land use agreed to by the city council be approved by a 55% vote in a referendum. The city planning commission and the city council both approved the proposed zoning change. However, the commission rejected the developer's subsequent application for "recreational area" approval for the proposed water park on the grounds that the council's rezoning action had not been submitted to a referendum. Assume that while the action was pending in the state court, the proposed zoning change was defeated in a referendum. Which would be the most applicable rule of constitutional law with respect to the referendum procedure when applied to a rezoning ordinance?

Options:

A: The referendum procedure is violative of the due process clause of the FourteenthAmendment.
B: The referendum procedure is arbitrary and capricious and thus should be held invalid as an unlawful delegation of legislative power.
C: The referendum procedure is not applicable in this context as it is only for state-wide legislation.
D: The referendum procedure as a basic instrument of the democratic process does not violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
E: The referendum procedure is a violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
F: The referendum procedure is valid only if it is not influenced by external factors.
G: The referendum procedure is unconstitutional as it infringes on the rights of property owners.
H: The referendum procedure is only applicable in cases of major legislative changes, not zoning changes.
I: The referendum procedure in this context is invalid as against publicpolicy.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this constitutional law question about referendums and zoning changes. Let's break it down step by step.

The question involves a state constitution that gives municipalities the power of referendum for any questions they can control through legislation. A developer is trying to get a zoning change to build a water park. The city's charter was amended to require a 55% referendum approval for any land use changes agreed by the city council. The planning commission and council approved the change, but the commission later rejected the recreational area application because the rezoning wasn't submitted to a referendum. Then, while in court, the referendum happened and the change was defeated.

The question is about the constitutional validity of applying the referendum procedure to a rezoning ordinance. The options are A through I, each presenting a different constitutional law principle.

I remember that referendums are a form of direct democracy, allowing the people to vote on laws or decisions. The constitutionality usually comes into play with issues like due process, equal protection, or whether it's a valid exercise of legislative power.

Option A says the referendum violates the due process clause. I'm not sure about that. Due process usually relates to fair procedures, and referendums themselves are a procedure, so maybe that's not the issue here.

Option B claims it's arbitrary and capricious, an unlawful delegation. But I think the legislature can delegate certain powers to the people through referendums. The non-delegation doctrine generally applies to delegations to administrative bodies, not to the people themselves. So B might not be correct.

Option C suggests referendums are only for state-wide legislation. That doesn't seem right. Municipalities often have their own referendums for local issues, so C is likely incorrect.

Option D states that the referendum doesn't violate the due process clause because it's a democratic process. This sounds plausible because the Supreme Court has generally upheld referendums as a legitimate form of decision-making unless they infringe on fundamental rights without a compelling state interest.

Option E argues equal protection violation. I don't see an equal protection issue here unless a specific group is being targeted, which isn't indicated in the question. So E might not apply.

Option F says it's only valid if not influenced by external factors. But all referendums can be influenced by various factors, so this seems too restrictive and probably not a correct rule.

Option G claims it infringes on property owners' rights. While zoning can affect property rights, the referendum process itself isn't necessarily unconstitutional. The issue here is the process, not the outcome affecting property rights.

Option H says referendums apply only to major legislative changes, not zoning. But zoning is a legislative function, so the referendum could apply. I don't think H is correct.

Option I argues it's against public policy. Public policy is more of a state law concept rather than a constitutional issue, so I don't think this is the right choice.

So, putting it together: The key issue is whether requiring a referendum for a zoning change (a legislative act) is constitutional. The Supreme Court has held that referendums are a valid exercise of the legislative power when delegated to the people. They don't inherently violate due process or equal protection unless they're used in a way that discriminates or infringes on fundamental rights without a rational basis.

In this case, the referendum is about a zoning change, which is a municipal legislative decision. The state constitution allows municipalities to have referendums on matters they can legislate. Therefore, the referendum procedure is a valid democratic process and doesn't violate the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. So the correct answer should be D.

The question revolves around the constitutional validity of a referendum procedure applied to a zoning change. The state constitution allows municipalities to use referendums for matters they can legislate. The developer sought a zoning change, which was approved by the city council but required a referendum under the city's charter. The referendum ultimately defeated the zoning change.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: The referendum does not violate due process, as it is a procedural mechanism of democracy.
- **B**: The delegation of legislative power to the people through referendum is valid and not arbitrary.
- **C**: Referendums are not limited to state-wide issues; municipalities can use them for local decisions like zoning.
- **D**: Referendums are a legitimate democratic process and do not violate due process unless they infringe on fundamental rights, which is not the case here.
- **E**: No equal protection issue arises, as no specific group is targeted.
- **F**: Referendums are inherently influenced by various factors, so this option is too restrictive.
- **G**: The referendum process itself does not infringe on property rights; it is a procedural matter.
- **H**: Zoning is a legislative function, and referendums can apply to such decisions.
- **I**: Public policy is not the constitutional issue here; the focus is on the referendum's validity.

The correct answer is **D**, as referendums are a valid democratic process and do not violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment when applied to zoning changes.
