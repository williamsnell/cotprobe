Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about determining the standard enthalpy of formation of DyCl3(s) using some given reactions and their enthalpy changes. Hmm, I remember that the standard enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So for DyCl3(s), that would be from Dy(s) and Cl2(g), I think.

The data given are three reactions with their ΔrH° values. I need to manipulate these to get the formation reaction of DyCl3(s). Let me write down each reaction clearly.

Reaction (1): DyCl3(s) → DyCl3(aq, in 4.0 M HCl) ΔrH° = -180.06 kJ/mol⁻¹

Reaction (2): Dy(s) + 3 HCl(aq, 4.0 M) → DyCl3(aq, in 4.0 M HCl(aq)) + 3/2 H2(g) ΔrH° = -699.43 kJ/mol⁻¹

Reaction (3): 1/2 H2(g) + 1/2 Cl2(g) → HCl(aq, 4.0 M) ΔrH° = -158.31 kJ/mol⁻¹

I think the key is to combine these reactions in such a way that we end up with the formation of DyCl3(s) from its elements. Let me outline the target equation:

Dy(s) + 3/2 Cl2(g) → DyCl3(s)       ΔfH° = ?

So I need to manipulate the given reactions to get this equation.

Let me think about each step.

First, reaction (2) produces DyCl3(aq) from Dy(s) and HCl. Reaction (3) is the formation of HCl(aq) from H2 and Cl2. So maybe I can use reaction (3) to replace the HCl in reaction (2).

But wait, reaction (2) uses HCl(aq) as a reactant. So, if I reverse reaction (3), I can get HCl from H+ and Cl- perhaps, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I should adjust reactions to account for the HCl.

Let me think about what each reaction provides.

Reaction (1) is the dissolution of DyCl3(s) into aqueous solution. So it's an endothermic or exothermic process depending on the sign. The Δ is negative, so exothermic.

Reaction (2) is Dysprosium metal reacting with HCl solution to form Dysprosium chloride in solution and release hydrogen gas. The Δ is negative, so exothermic.

Reaction (3) is the formation of HCl in solution from its elements. Again, exothermic as Δ is negative.

Hmm. Maybe I can use Hess's Law here, which states that the total enthalpy change is the sum of the steps. So I need to find a way to combine these reactions.

Let me try writing the target equation and see how the given reactions can combine to form it.

The formation reaction is:

Dy(s) + (3/2) Cl2(g) → DyCl3(s)       ΔfH° = ?

I need to find ΔfH° for this.

Let me see the given reactions.

Reaction (2) is Dy(s) + 3 HCl → DyCl3(aq) + 3/2 H2(g) with Δ=-699.43 kJ/mol⁻¹.

Reaction (1) is DyCl3(s) → DyCl3(aq) with Δ=-180.06 kJ/mol⁻¹. Wait, so if I reverse reaction (1), it would be DyCl3(aq) → DyCl3(s) with Δ=+180.06 kJ/mol⁻¹.

So perhaps I can take reaction (2), then add the reversed reaction (1), which would turn DyCl3(aq) into DyCl3(s). Let's write that.

Reaction (2): Dy(s) + 3 HCl → DyCl3(aq) + 3/2 H2(g)      Δ=-699.43

Plus reversed reaction (1): DyCl3(aq) → DyCl3(s)          Δ=+180.06

Adding these two, the DyCl3(aq) cancels out, so we get:

Dy(s) + 3 HCl → DyCl3(s) + 3/2 H2(g)      Δ = (-699.43) + 180.06 = ?

Let me compute that: -699.43 + 180.06 = -519.37 kJ/mol⁻¹.

Wait, no, because when you reverse reaction (1), you add its enthalpy change as positive. So yes, that's correct.

So now, the combined reaction is:

Dy(s) + 3 HCl(aq) → DyCl3(s) + 3/2 H2(g)      Δ = (-699.43 + 180.06) = -519.37 kJ/mol⁻¹.

But I want to get rid of the HCl and H2 to form Cl2. So I need to express HCl in terms of H2 and Cl2.

Looking at reaction (3): 1/2 H2 + 1/2 Cl2 → HCl(aq)       Δ = -158.31 kJ/mol⁻¹.

So if I reverse reaction (3), I get HCl(aq) → 1/2 H2 + 1/2 Cl2 with Δ = +158.31 kJ/mol⁻¹.

But in reaction (2), I have 3 moles of HCl as reactants. So for each mole of HCl, I can replace it with 1/2 H2 and 1/2 Cl2, but since it's a reactant, perhaps I should think in terms of the reverse.

Wait, in the combined reaction I have after adding (2) and reversed (1):

Dy(s) + 3 HCl → DyCl3(s) + 3/2 H2(g)      Δ = -519.37.

So, to get rid of HCl, I can express each HCl as being formed from H2 and Cl2. Since reaction (3) is forming HCl from H2 and Cl2, perhaps I can multiply reaction (3) by 3 and reverse it to get 3 HCl on the reactant side.

Wait, let me think again.

In the combined reaction, I have 3 HCl as reactants. So I can write each HCl as (from reaction 3 reversed): HCl → 1/2 H2 + 1/2 Cl2, Δ = +158.31 per mole of HCl.

But since I have 3 moles of HCl, I can multiply reaction (3) reversed by 3:

3 HCl → 3*(1/2 H2 + 1/2 Cl2) → 3/2 H2 + 3/2 Cl2, Δ = 3*(+158.31) = +474.93 kJ.

Wait, but in the combined reaction, the 3 HCl is on the reactant side, so I need to represent that 3 HCl comes from 3/2 H2 and 3/2 Cl2. So perhaps I should subtract (i.e., reverse) this.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to express the 3 HCl in terms of H2 and Cl2.

In reaction (3), HCl is formed from H2 and Cl2. So to get HCl as a reactant, I can reverse reaction (3) and multiply by 3.

Reversed reaction (3) per mole: HCl → 1/2 H2 + 1/2 Cl2, Δ = +158.31.

So for 3 moles: 3 HCl → 3*(1/2 H2 + 1/2 Cl2) → 3/2 H2 + 3/2 Cl2, Δ = 3*(158.31) = +474.93 kJ.

But wait, in the combined reaction, 3 HCl is a reactant, so perhaps I should subtract this reversed reaction from the combined reaction. Hmm, that's getting a bit confusing. Let me think about it in terms of Hess's Law.

The combined reaction after (2) and reversed (1) is:

Dy(s) + 3 HCl → DyCl3(s) + 3/2 H2(g)      Δ = -519.37.

Now, I can replace the 3 HCl with the products from reaction (3). Wait, no, because HCl is a reactant. So I can write each HCl as being formed from H2 and Cl2, but since HCl is a reactant, perhaps I need to include the reverse of reaction (3) multiplied by 3.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it this way:

We have the reaction:

Dy(s) + 3 HCl → DyCl3(s) + 3/2 H2(g)      Δ = -519.37.

But I want to eliminate HCl and H2 and replace them with Cl2.

So, 3 HCl is on the reactant side. Let's write each HCl as coming from 1/2 H2 and 1/2 Cl2.

Wait, no, reaction (3) is HCl being formed, so to get HCl as a reactant, we can reverse reaction (3). So each HCl in the reactant side would produce 1/2 H2 and 1/2 Cl2 as products, but wait, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I should subtract 3 times reaction (3) from the combined reaction. Let me try that.

Wait, the combined reaction is:

Dy(s) + 3 HCl → DyCl3(s) + 3/2 H2(g)      Δ = -519.37.

Now, I want to replace the 3 HCl on the reactant side with H2 and Cl2.

Each HCl can be expressed via the reverse of reaction (3), which is HCl → 1/2 H2 + 1/2 Cl2, Δ = +158.31.

So, for 3 HCl, we have:

3 HCl → 3*(1/2 H2 + 1/2 Cl2) → 3/2 H2 + 3/2 Cl2, Δ = 3*158.31 = +474.93.

So, if I subtract this reaction from the combined reaction, I'm essentially replacing the 3 HCl with 3/2 H2 and 3/2 Cl2.

Wait, no, because in the combined reaction, HCl is a reactant. So perhaps I can represent the 3 HCl as coming from H2 and Cl2, which would mean adding the reverse of reaction (3) multiplied by 3.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the combined reaction as:

Dy(s) + 3 HCl → DyCl3(s) + 3/2 H2.

And then, for each HCl, decompose it into H2 and Cl2 via the reversed reaction (3). So, 3 HCl → 3*(1/2 H2 + 1/2 Cl2) → 3/2 H2 + 3/2 Cl2, Δ = +474.93.

So, subtracting this from the combined reaction, because HCl is on the reactant side, we would subtract the decomposition reaction.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to approach this by writing all equations and then combining them.

Let me list all the reactions:

Reaction (2): Dy + 3 HCl → DyCl3(aq) + 3/2 H2     Δ = -699.43

Reversed reaction (1): DyCl3(aq) → DyCl3(s)         Δ = +180.06

So, adding these gives:

Dy + 3 HCl → DyCl3(s) + 3/2 H2                 Δ = (-699.43 + 180.06) = -519.37.

Now, to get rid of HCl and H2, I can relate them to Cl2.

Each HCl in the reactants can be written as H2 and Cl2 via reaction (3), but reversed.

So for each HCl, the reverse of reaction (3) is HCl → 1/2 H2 + 1/2 Cl2, Δ = +158.31.

Since there are 3 HCl in the reactants, I can write 3 times this reversed reaction:

3 HCl → 3*(1/2 H2 + 1/2 Cl2) → 3/2 H2 + 3/2 Cl2, Δ = 3*(158.31) = +474.93.

Now, if I subtract this from the combined reaction (Dy + 3 HCl → DyCl3(s) + 3/2 H2), because the 3 HCl are reactants, perhaps I can represent this by adding the reversed reaction to eliminate HCl.

Wait, maybe I can think of the combined reaction as:

Dy(s) + 3 HCl → DyCl3(s) + 3/2 H2(g)      Δ = -519.37.

Then, I can subtract the decomposition of 3 HCl into H2 and Cl2:

3 HCl → 3/2 H2(g) + 3/2 Cl2(g)          Δ = +474.93.

But wait, in the combined reaction, 3 HCl is a reactant, so if I subtract the decomposition reaction, it would be:

[Dy + 3 HCl → DyCl3(s) + 3/2 H2] - [3 HCl → 3/2 H2 + 3/2 Cl2] = Dy + 3 HCl - 3 HCl → DyCl3(s) + 3/2 H2 - (3/2 H2 + 3/2 Cl2)

Simplifying, that gives Dy → DyCl3(s) - 3/2 Cl2.

Which rearranges to Dy + 3/2 Cl2 → DyCl3(s).

That's exactly the formation reaction we want!

So, the overall reaction becomes:

Dy(s) + (3/2) Cl2(g) → DyCl3(s)        ΔfH° = ?

Now, the Δ for this reaction is calculated by combining the Δ values of the steps.

So, the overall Δ is the Δ of the combined reaction (Dy + 3 HCl → DyCl3(s) + 3/2 H2) which is -519.37 kJ, minus the Δ of the decomposition of 3 HCl into H2 and Cl2, which is +474.93 kJ.

Wait, no, because when you subtract a reaction, you subtract its Δ. So the overall Δ is (-519.37) - (+474.93) = -519.37 - 474.93 = -994.3 kJ/mol⁻¹.

Wait, let me double-check the signs. The combined reaction (after (2) and reversed (1)) has Δ = -519.37.

The decomposition reaction (3 HCl → products) has Δ = +474.93.

So when we subtract this decomposition reaction, the overall Δ is (-519.37) - (474.93) = -994.3 kJ/mol⁻¹.

So that's the standard enthalpy of formation of DyCl3(s), which is option G: -994.3 kJ/mol⁻¹.

Let me just verify to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.

Adding reaction (2) and reversed (1):

-699.43 + 180.06 = -519.37. That looks correct.

Reaction (3) multiplied by 3 and reversed: 3 * 158.31 = 474.93, and since it's reversed, it's positive.

Then, the total Δ is -519.37 - 474.93 = -994.3.

Yes, that seems right.
</think>

To determine the standard enthalpy of formation of $\mathrm{DyCl}_3(\mathrm{s})$, we use the given reactions and their enthalpy changes, combining them according to Hess's Law. The target reaction is:

\[
\mathrm{Dy(s)} + \frac{3}{2} \mathrm{Cl}_2(\mathrm{g}) \rightarrow \mathrm{DyCl}_3(\mathrm{s}) \quad \Delta_{\mathrm{f}} H^{\ominus} = ?
\]

### Step 1: Combine Reactions (2) and (1)
Reaction (2) is:

\[
\mathrm{Dy(s)} + 3 \mathrm{HCl(aq)} \rightarrow \mathrm{DyCl}_3(\mathrm{aq}) + \frac{3}{2} \mathrm{H}_2(\mathrm{g}) \quad \Delta_{\mathrm{r}} H^{\ominus} = -699.43 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}.
\]

Reaction (1) is reversed:

\[
\mathrm{DyCl}_3(\mathrm{aq}) \rightarrow \mathrm{DyCl}_3(\mathrm{s}) \quad \Delta_{\mathrm{r}} H^{\ominus} = +180.06 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}.
\]

Adding these reactions cancels $\mathrm{DyCl}_3(\mathrm{aq})$, resulting in:

\[
\mathrm{Dy(s)} + 3 \mathrm{HCl(aq)} \rightarrow \mathrm{DyCl}_3(\mathrm{s}) + \frac{3}{2} \mathrm{H}_2(\mathrm{g}) \quad \Delta_{\mathrm{r}} H^{\ominus} = -699.43 + 180.06 = -519.37 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}.
\]

### Step 2: Replace $\mathrm{HCl(aq)}$ with $\mathrm{H}_2(\mathrm{g})$ and $\mathrm{Cl}_2(\mathrm{g})$
Reaction (3) is:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{H}_2(\mathrm{g}) + \frac{1}{2} \mathrm{Cl}_2(\mathrm{g}) \rightarrow \mathrm{HCl(aq)} \quad \Delta_{\mathrm{r}} H^{\ominus} = -158.31 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}.
\]

Reversing reaction (3) gives:

\[
\mathrm{HCl(aq)} \rightarrow \frac{1}{2} \mathrm{H}_2(\mathrm{g}) + \frac{1}{2} \mathrm{Cl}_2(\
