Okay, so I've got this math problem here about figuring out how many rolls of paper are needed to cover a room. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, I remember that these kinds of problems involve calculating surface areas and then considering waste and openings. Let me see.

First, the room's dimensions are given: 18 feet long, 12 feet wide, and 10 feet high. I need to find the total area of the walls. Wait, the ceiling and floor? Oh wait, no, papering usually refers to the walls, right? So I shouldn't include the ceiling or the floor, just the four walls.

So, the room has two longer walls and two shorter walls. The longer walls are 18 feet long and 10 feet high. Each of those has an area of 18*10 = 180 square feet. Since there are two of them, that's 180*2 = 360 square feet.

The shorter walls are 12 feet wide and 10 feet high. So each is 12*10 = 120 square feet. Two of those would be 120*2 = 240 square feet.

Adding them together, the total wall area is 360 + 240 = 600 square feet.

Wait, but there are openings: one window and one door. I need to subtract those areas. The window is 3ft by 8ft, so 3*8=24 sq ft. The door is 4ft by 9ft, which is 4*9=36 sq ft. So total openings area is 24 +36=60 sq ft.

So subtracting that from the total wall area: 600 -60=540 square feet. Okay, that's the area that needs to be covered.

But wait, the problem says there's a 10% waste of paper. So I can't just take 540 and divide by the roll size. I need to account for that extra 10% being wasted. So the total paper needed is 540 plus 10% more. Let me calculate that. 10% of 540 is 54, so total paper needed is 540 +54=594 square feet.

Now, each roll has 36 square feet of paper. So the number of rolls needed is the total paper required divided by the roll size. So 594 / 36 = let's see, 36 times 16 is 576, which is less than 594. 36*16=576, 16 rolls would give 576. Then 594-576=18. So 18 more square feet needed. Since each roll is 36, I can't get a fraction of a roll, so I need to round up. So 16 rolls would give 576, which isn't enough. 17 rolls would be 17*36=612. That's more than 594.

Wait wait, 594 divided by 36 equals... Let me do the division. 36 times 16 is 576, as I said. 594-576=18. So 18 left. So 594 is 16.5 rolls, but since you can't do half a roll, you need to round up to 17 rolls. So that would be option A:17. But wait, let me check the options. The options are A:17, B:20, etc.

Wait, but wait a minute. Did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me double-check the calculations.

Total wall area: 2*(18*10) + 2*(12*10) = 360 +240=600. Correct. Openings: 24+36=60. So 600-60=540. Correct. 10% waste: 540 *1.1=594. Correct. Each roll is 36 sq ft. So 594/36=16.5. Which is 16.5 rolls, so you need 17 rolls. So option A is 17.

Wait, but let me look at the options again. Option A is 17, which would be the right answer as per my calculation. So why are some other options higher? Maybe I made a mistake in the wall area calculation.

Wait, wait, the dimensions: 18 feet long, 12 feet wide, 10 feet high. So the two walls are 18x10 and 12x10. So the calculation seems correct. Let me see: 18x10 is 180 for each long wall, two of them make 360. 12x10 is 120 for each short wall, two make 240. 360+240=600. Yes.

Wait, but sometimes, when people paper a room, do they include the ceiling? No, I don't think so. Because the question specifically says 'paper a room' and mentions walls, I think. Or does it? Let me re-read the question.

The question says: "paper a room 18 feet long, 12 feet wide, and 10 feet high, allowing for a 10% waste of paper." It says "make allowance for openings, which include..." So the openings are subtracted from the area to be covered. So I think only the walls are considered. So my initial approach is correct.

Wait another thing: when you paper a room, sometimes the ceiling is also papered, but in this problem, since it's about the walls, I think we're only considering the walls. So yes, 600 sq ft minus 60 is 540, plus 10% is 594.

594 divided by 36 is 16.5, so 17 rolls. So the answer should be A:17.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 17. So that's the correct answer.

To determine the number of single rolls required to paper the room, we start by calculating the total area of the walls. The room has dimensions of 18 feet long, 12 feet wide, and 10 feet high. There are two longer walls (18 ft by 10 ft) and two shorter walls (12 ft by 10 ft). 

- Area of the two longer walls:  
  \[
  2 \times (18 \times 10) = 2 \times 180 = 360 \, \text{square feet}
  \]

- Area of the two shorter walls:  
  \[
  2 \times (12 \times 10) = 2 \times 120 = 240 \, \text{square feet}
  \]

- Total wall area:  
  \[
  360 + 240 = 600 \, \text{square feet}
  \]

Next, we account for the openings: one window (3 ft by 8 ft) and one door (4 ft by 9 ft). 

- Area of the window:  
  \[
  3 \times 8 = 24 \, \text{square feet}
  \]

- Area of the door:  
  \[
  4 \times 9 = 36 \, \text{square feet}
  \]

- Total area of openings:  
  \[
  24 + 36 = 60 \, \text{square feet}
  \]

- Net area to be covered:  
  \[
  600 - 60 = 540 \, \text{square feet}
  \]

To account for 10% waste, the total paper required is:  
\[
540 \times 1.1 = 594 \, \text{square feet}
\]

Each roll of paper covers 36 square feet. The number of rolls needed is:  
\[
\frac{594}{36} = 16.5
\]

Since we cannot use a fraction of a roll, we round up to the next whole number, resulting in 17 rolls. 

Thus, the correct answer is **A: 17**.
