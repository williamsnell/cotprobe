Okay, so I've got this question about Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) according to Wood (1991), and I need to figure out the three outcomes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, I remember that CSR is about how companies manage their social responsibilities. Wood's work is a bit old, but I think he proposed a framework that breaks down CSR into different components. I think he talked about three main outcomes, but I'm not exactly sure what they are.

Wait, I recall that Wood's model includes three areas: social policies, social programmes, and social impacts. Let me unpack that. Social policies would be the guidelines or principles that a company sets to guide its CSR activities. So, like, the rules or stance they take on social issues.

Then, social programmes are the actual activities or initiatives the company undertakes. These could be projects or actions aimed at addressing social issues, like community development, environmental initiatives, or employee welfare programs.

Lastly, social impacts refer to the effects or outcomes of these policies and programmes. This would measure how the company's actions have affected society, the environment, or other stakeholders.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that matches these three: policies, programmes, and impacts. Let me go through the choices.

Option A: Social policies, Social responsibility, Social impacts. Wait, social responsibility is a broader term, maybe not one of the outcomes.

Option B: Social policies, Social evidencing, Social impacts. Evidencing doesn't sound familiar.

Option C: Policies, audits, impacts. Audits are more about evaluation, not outcomes.

Option D: Policies, programmes, analysis. Analysis is more like assessing, not an outcome.

Option E: Evaluations, programmes, impacts. Evaluations are assessments, not outcomes.

Option F: Policies, programmes, discussions. Discussions seem more like a process, not outcomes.

Option G: Policies, impacts, justice. Justice is a concept, not an outcome.

Option H: Assessments, programmes, impacts. Assessments again, not outcomes.

Option I: Planning, programmes, impacts. Planning is part of the process.

Option J: Policies, programmes, impacts. Yes, that fits what I was thinking.

So the correct answer should be J.

The question asks about the three outcomes of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) according to Wood (1991). After analyzing the options, the correct answer is Option J: Social policies, Social programmes, and Social impacts. 

- **Social policies** refer to the guidelines or principles guiding a company's CSR activities.
- **Social programmes** are the actual initiatives or activities undertaken by the company.
- **Social impacts** are the effects or outcomes of these policies and programmes on society or stakeholders.

Other options either include terms that are broader concepts, processes, or assessments rather than specific outcomes. Thus, the answer is:

J
