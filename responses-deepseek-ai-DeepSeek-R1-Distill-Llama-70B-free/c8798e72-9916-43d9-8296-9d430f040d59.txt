Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that the Lyons family estimates that 20% of their net income is spent on food each week. Mrs. Lyons spent $36 on food shopping last week. The question is asking for the family's net income for that week. The options are from A to J, with various dollar amounts.

Alright, so the key here is that 20% of their net income equals $36. I need to find the total net income based on that percentage.

Let me think about percentages. If 20% of something is 36, then 100% would be five times that, right? Because 20% is a fifth. So, if I take $36 and multiply it by 5, that should give me the total net income.

Wait, let me make sure. So, 20% is the same as 0.20 in decimal form. So if I let the net income be x, then 0.20 * x = 36. To solve for x, I'd divide both sides by 0.20. So x = 36 / 0.20. Let me calculate that.

36 divided by 0.2... Hmm, 0.2 goes into 36 how many times? Well, 0.2 times 180 is 36 because 0.2 * 180 = 36. So x is 180. So the net income is $180.

Looking at the options, E is $180. So the answer should be E.

Wait a second, let me double-check. If their net income is $180, then 20% of that is (20/100)*180 = 0.2*180 = 36. Yep, that matches the $36 spent on food. So yes, E is correct.

The Lyons family's food expenditure is 20% of their net income. Given that Mrs. Lyons spent $36 on food, we can calculate the net income by dividing $36 by 0.20 (since 20% = 0.20). 

\[
\text{Net Income} = \frac{\$36}{0.20} = \$180
\]

Thus, the family's net income for the week is $180, which corresponds to option E.

Answer: E
