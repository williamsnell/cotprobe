Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about lasers and photons. Hmm, I remember that photons are particles that make up light, and their energy is related to the wavelength. The question is about finding the number of photons emitted per second by a nitrogen laser. Let's think through how to approach this.

First, the problem gives me the power output of the laser, which is 1.00 mW. Wait, power is in watts, right? And one watt is one joule per second. So milliwatts are just thousandths of a watt. So 1.00 mW is 0.001 W, since milli means 10^-3.

Now, the laser emits at a wavelength of 337 nm. I remember that the energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. Oh right, but I need to make sure the units match. The wavelength here is in nanometers, so I should convert that to meters because the standard units for these constants are in meters.

So 337 nm is 337e-9 meters, right? Because nano is 10^-9. Let me write that down: λ = 337e-9 m.

Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is approximately 3.00e8 m/s. So putting those into the equation, E = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (3.00e8 m/s) / (337e-9 m). 

Wait, let me calculate that denominator first. 337e-9 is 3.37e-7 m? No wait, 337e-9 is 3.37e-7? Wait, 337 is 3.37 times 10^2, so 337e-9 is 3.37e-7? No, wait, no: 337e-9 is 3.37 * 10^2 * 1e-9 = 3.37e-7? Let me think: 1e-9 is 0.000000001. So 337 times that is 0.000000337, which is 3.37e-7. Yeah, that's correct.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (3.37e-7). Let me compute the numerator first: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then divide by 3.37e-7 m. So 1.9878e-25 / 3.37e-7 = approximately 5.898e-19 J per photon.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 6.626e-34 times 3e8 is (6.626 * 3) = 19.878, and exponents: 10^-34 * 10^8 is 10^-26. So 19.878e-26 J·m. Then divide by 3.37e-7 m. So 19.878e-26 / 3.37e-7 = (19.878 / 3.37) * 10^(-26 +7) = approximately 5.898 * 10^-19 J.

So each photon has an energy of about 5.898e-19 J.

Now, the power of the laser is 0.001 W, which is 0.001 J/s. Power is energy per unit time, so the energy emitted per second is 0.001 J. So to find the number of photons emitted per second, I can divide the total energy per second by the energy per photon.

So n = P / E. P is 0.001 J/s, E is 5.898e-19 J/photon. So n = 0.001 / 5.898e-19 = ?

Calculating that: 0.001 is 1e-3. So 1e-3 / 5.898e-19 = (1 / 5.898) * 1e16. 1 divided by approximately 5.898 is about 0.1696. So 0.1696e16 = 1.696e15 photons per second.

Wait, but let me recalculate that division more accurately. Let's compute 1e-3 divided by 5.898e-19.

1e-3 /5.898e-19 = (1 /5.898 ) * 1e( -3 +19 ) = (approx 0.1696) * 1e16 = 1.696e15.

So approximately 1.7e15 photons per second.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.70e15, which matches. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me go through the steps again.

First, energy per photon: E = hc/λ.

h=6.626e-34, c=3e8, λ=337e-9 m.

E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (337e-9) 

Calculate numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25.

Divide by 337e-9 = 3.37e-7.

So 1.9878e-25 / 3.37e-7 = let's compute 1.9878 / 3.37 first.

1.9878 / 3.37 ≈ 0.5898.

Then the exponents: 1e-25 / 1e-7 = 1e-18.

So 0.5898e-18 = 5.898e-19 J. So that's correct.

Then Power P is 1 mW = 0.001 W = 0.001 J/s.

Number of photons per second n = P / E = 0.001 / 5.898e-19.

0.001 is 1e-3.

So (1e-3) / (5.898e-19) = (1 / 5.898) * (1e-3 / 1e-19) )

Wait, 1e-3 / 1e-19 = 1e16.

So 1 / 5.898 is approximately 0.1696. So 0.1696 * 1e16 = 1.696e15, which is 1.70e15, matching option A.

So yeah, I think A is correct.

To determine the number of photons emitted per second by a 1.00 mW nitrogen laser, we start by calculating the energy of a single photon using the formula:

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

where:
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \mathrm{J \cdot s} \) (Planck's constant),
- \( c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \mathrm{m/s} \) (speed of light),
- \( \lambda = 337 \, \mathrm{nm} = 337 \times 10^{-9} \, \mathrm{m} \) (wavelength of the laser).

Substituting the values:

\[
E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34}) (3.00 \times 10^8)}{337 \times 10^{-9}}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
(6.626 \times 10^{-34}) (3.00 \times 10^8) = 1.9878 \times 10^{-25} \, \mathrm{J \cdot m}
\]

Next, divide by the wavelength:

\[
E = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{337 \times 10^{-9}} = \frac{1.9878}{337} \times 10^{-25 + 9} = 5.898 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{J}
\]

Thus, the energy of a single photon is approximately \( 5.898 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{J} \).

The laser's power is given as \( 1.00 \, \mathrm{mW} = 0.001 \, \mathrm{W} = 0.001 \, \mathrm{J/s} \). The number of photons emitted per second is the total energy emitted per second divided by the energy per photon:

\[
n = \frac{P}{E} = \frac{0.001}{5.898 \times 10^{-19}}
\]

Simplify:

\[
n = \frac{1 \times 10^{-3}}{5.898 \times 10^{-19}} = \frac{1}{5.898} \times 10^{16} \approx 0.1696 \times 10^{16} = 1.696 \times 10^{15} \, \mathrm{photons/second}
\]

This rounds to \( 1.70 \times 10^{15} \, \mathrm{photons/second} \), which corresponds to option **A**.
