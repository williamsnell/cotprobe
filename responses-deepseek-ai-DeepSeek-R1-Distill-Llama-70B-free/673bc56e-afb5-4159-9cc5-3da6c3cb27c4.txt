Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about group homomorphisms. I'm a bit rusty on my group theory, but let's try to work through this step by step.

The question has two statements, and I need to evaluate their truthfulness. Then, based on that, choose the correct option from A to D.

Statement 1 says: "A homomorphism is one to one if and only if the kernel consists of the identity element alone." Hmm. I remember that the kernel of a homomorphism is the set of elements in the domain that map to the identity element in the codomain. So for a homomorphism φ: G → H, ker(φ) = {g ∈ G | φ(g) = e_H}.

Now, if the kernel only has the identity element, that would mean that the only element mapping to the identity is the identity itself. I think that implies the homomorphism is injective (one-to-one) because no two different elements in G would map to the same element in H. Because if two elements g1 and g2 map to the same h, then g1*g2^{-1} would be in the kernel. So if the kernel is trivial (only identity), then g1 must equal g2, meaning it's injective.

Is the converse true? If a homomorphism is one-to-one, does the kernel have to be trivial? Well, yes, because in a one-to-one map, the only element that can map to the identity is the identity. Otherwise, if another element was in the kernel, you'd have φ(g) = e, which would mean g must be the identity if it's injective. So Statement 1 seems to be true.

Moving on to Statement 2: "The image of a group of 6 elements under some homomorphism may have 4 elements." Okay, so the image is the set of all φ(g) where g is in G. The size of the image is related to the size of the kernel via the First Isomorphism Theorem, which says that the order of the image is equal to the order of G divided by the order of the kernel.

So G has 6 elements. Let's see possible kernel sizes. The kernel must be a normal subgroup of G. What are the possible orders of normal subgroups in a group of order 6?

Wait, groups of order 6 are either cyclic (isomorphic to Z6) or the symmetric group S3. If G is cyclic, then all its subgroups are cyclic, and their orders must divide 6. So possible kernel sizes could be 1, 2, 3, or 6.

If the kernel has order 1, then the image has order 6/1=6. So image size 6.

If kernel order is 2, image size is 3 (6/2=3).

If kernel order is 3, image size is 2 (6/3=2).

If kernel order is 6, image size is 1.

But wait, the statement says the image has 4 elements. 4 doesn't divide 6, because 6 mod 4 is 2. So 4 isn't a divisor of 6. So the image size can't be 4 because the order of the image must divide the order of the domain group (since it's isomorphic to G/ker φ, and Lagrange's theorem says the order must divide G's order).

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. What if G isn't simple? No, wait, the image size is the order of G divided by the kernel's order. So possible image sizes when G has order 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6. There's no way to get 4. So statement 2 says it "may have 4 elements", which would be false because it's impossible.

So Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false. Looking at the options, option D says "True, False". So the correct answer should be D.
</think>

Statement 1: "A homomorphism is one to one if and only if the kernel consists of the identity element alone." This is true because if the kernel contains only the identity element, the homomorphism is injective (one-to-one). Conversely, if a homomorphism is one-to-one, the kernel must be trivial, as any non-identity element in the kernel would violate injectivity.

Statement 2: "The image of a group of 6 elements under some homomorphism may have 4 elements." This is false. By the First Isomorphism Theorem, the order of the image of a group under a homomorphism must divide the order of the group. Since the group has 6 elements, the possible sizes of the image are 1, 2, 3, or 6. An image size of 4 is not possible because 4 does not divide 6.

Thus, Statement 1 is true, and Statement 2 is false. The correct answer is:

D
