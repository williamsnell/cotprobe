Okay, so I've got this question about which place was the last to be occupied by humans. The options are Madagascar, Australia, Hawaii, New Zealand, The Maldives, Fiji, Tahiti, Timor, Vanuatu, and New Guinea. Hmm, I need to figure out which one was settled last.

I remember from history that different islands were colonized at different times. I think Australia was one of the earlier ones. Wait, wasn't Australia settled around 65,000 years ago? But I'm not 100% sure. Then there's New Guinea, which I think was also settled pretty early, maybe around the same time as Australia since they were connected by a land bridge during the ice age.

Madagascar is off the coast of Africa, right? I think people arrived there around 350 BCE or so, maybe later. That's much later than Australia and New Guinea.

Hawaii is in the Pacific, and I remember that Polynesians settled there around 1000-1200 CE. So that's later than Madagascar perhaps. But wait, when was New Zealand settled? I think the Maori arrived there around the 13th century, so maybe a bit after Hawaii.

Looking at the other options: The Maldives, Fiji, Vanuatu, Tahiti, Timor. I'm not too sure about their exact timelines. Fiji and Vanuatu are in the Pacific and were probably settled by Lapita people maybe around 1000-1500 BCE? Or was it later? Wait, Lapita culture is around 1300-750 BCE, so maybe Fiji and Vanuatu were settled around 1000 BCE or so.

Tahiti was part of the Society Islands and was settled later than Hawaii, I think. Maybe around 1000-1200 CE as well. But I'm not certain.

Wait, the question is about the last to be occupied. So which one was settled latest? I think the last major habitable place was New Zealand. Or was it Hawaii?

Wait, no, I think New Zealand was settled around the 13th century, maybe 1250-1300 CE. Hawaii was settled earlier, maybe 1000-1200 CE. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I've heard that Easter Island was one of the last, but it's not in the options. So among the options given, which one is the latest?

Another thought: Madagascar was settled by Austronesian people from present-day Indonesia around 350-550 CE. So that's earlier than Hawaii and New Zealand.

Wait, so putting it together:

- Australia: ~65,000 years ago
- New Guinea: similar time to Australia
- Madagascar: ~350-550 CE
- Fiji, Vanuatu, etc.: maybe around 1000 BCE to 500 CE
- Hawaii: ~1000-1200 CE
- New Zealand: ~1200-1300 CE

So the last would be New Zealand. So the answer would be D: New Zealand.

Wait, but what about the Maldives? I'm not sure when they were settled. Maybe later than the others? I think the Maldives has been inhabited since ancient times, but perhaps not as late as New Zealand. I'm not certain, but I think New Zealand was settled later than the others listed except maybe Hawaii and New Zealand.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is New Zealand because it's the last among the options given. So I'm going to go with D: New Zealand.

The question asks which of the listed places was the last to be occupied by humans. To determine this, we analyze the approximate settlement times of each location:

- **Australia**: Settled around 65,000 years ago.
- **New Guinea**: Settled around the same time as Australia, due to their land bridge connection during the ice age.
- **Madagascar**: Settled by Austronesian people around 350-550 CE.
- **Fiji and Vanuatu**: Likely settled by Lapita people around 1000-500 BCE.
- **Hawaii**: Settled by Polynesians around 1000-1200 CE.
- **New Zealand**: Settled by the Maori around the 13th century (1250-1300 CE).
- **The Maldives, Tahiti, and Timor**: While their exact timelines are less certain, they were likely settled earlier than New Zealand.

Based on this analysis, New Zealand was settled later than the other options provided, making it the last to be occupied by humans.
