Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the percentage of ionization of acetic acid. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate in water. The problem gives me the Ka value and the concentration, and I need to find the percentage ionization.

Alright, the given Ka is 1.8 × 10^-5, and the concentration is 0.5 M. The dissociation reaction is HC₂H₃O₂ ⇌ H+ + C₂H₃O₂⁻. So, I think I can set up an ICE table to solve this.

Let me recall the ICE table structure. Initial concentrations: HC₂H₃O₂ is 0.5 M, and both H+ and C₂H₃O₂⁻ are 0. Change during reaction: HC₂H₃O₂ decreases by x, while H+ and C₂H₃O₂⁻ increase by x each. At equilibrium, the concentrations are 0.5 - x, x, and x.

So, the expression for Ka would be [H+][C₂H₃O₂⁻]/[HC₂H₃O₂] = (x)(x)/(0.5 - x) = x²/(0.5 - x) = 1.8e-5.

Now, I can make an approximation here since Ka is pretty small (1.8e-5 is much less than 0.5). That suggests that x is going to be much smaller than 0.5, so 0.5 - x ≈ 0.5. So the equation simplifies to x² / 0.5 ≈ 1.8e-5.

Solving for x²: x² = 1.8e-5 * 0.5 = 9e-6. Taking the square root, x = sqrt(9e-6). Let's calculate that. The square root of 9 is 3, and sqrt(1e-6) is 1e-3. So x is 3e-3, which is 0.003 M.

Percentage ionization is (x / initial concentration) * 100. So that's (0.003 / 0.5) * 100. Let's compute that. 0.003 divided by 0.5 is 0.006. Multiply by 100 gives 0.6%. So the percentage ionization is 0.60%.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 0.60%. So that should be the answer.

But wait, did I make any mistakes in the approximation? Let's double-check. The assumption was that x is negligible compared to 0.5. Since x is 0.003, and 0.5 is 500 times larger, the approximation holds. So I think I did it right.

So yeah, the answer should be A.

To calculate the percentage of ionization of 0.5 M acetic acid with a given \( K_a = 1.8 \times 10^{-5} \), we start by setting up the dissociation reaction:

\[
\text{HC}_2\text{H}_3\text{O}_2 \rightleftharpoons \text{H}^+ + \text{C}_2\text{H}_3\text{O}_2^-
\]

Using an ICE table, the equilibrium concentrations are:
- \([\text{HC}_2\text{H}_3\text{O}_2] = 0.5 - x\),
- \([\text{H}^+] = x\),
- \([\text{C}_2\text{H}_3\text{O}_2^-] = x\).

The expression for \( K_a \) is:

\[
K_a = \frac{[H^+][C_2H_3O_2^-]}{[\text{HC}_2\text{H}_3\text{O}_2]} = \frac{x^2}{0.5 - x}.
\]

Since \( K_a \) is small, we approximate \( 0.5 - x \approx 0.5 \), simplifying to:

\[
\frac{x^2}{0.5} = 1.8 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x^2 = (1.8 \times 10^{-5})(0.5) = 9 \times 10^{-6}, \quad x = \sqrt{9 \times 10^{-6}} = 3 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}.
\]

The percentage ionization is:

\[
\text{Percentage Ionization} = \left( \frac{x}{\text{Initial Concentration}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{0.003}{0.5} \right) \times 100 = 0.60\%.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is **A: 0.60%**.
