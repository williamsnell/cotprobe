Question:

One day, while visiting a plastic surgery clinic for a routine Botox treatment, a patient received an excessive dose of Botox from a new medical assistant on the staff. Her face frozen in a grotesque grimace, she demanded to speak to the doctor. The doctor said, "Listen, why don't you go over to the emergency room and send the bills to me? I'll take care of your medical expenses. " The patient subsequently sued the doctor for negligent hiring of the medical assistant and for damages. At trial, she proposes to call the doctor's administrative assistant, who was present during her conversation with the doctor. The patient wants the administrative assistant to testify to the doctor's offer to pay her medical bills. The doctor's attorney objects. The trial judge should

Options:

A: sustain the objection, as the administrative assistant is not qualified to testify on medical matters.
B: sustain the objection as an offer to pay the medical bills.
C: sustain the objection, as the conversation between the doctor and patient should be kept confidential.
D: overrule the objection, as the patient has a right to call any witness to support her case.
E: overrule the objection, as the testimony could provide context to the incident.
F: overrule the objection, as the administrative assistant's testimony could shed light on the doctor's character and integrity.
G: overrule the objection, because an offer to pay medical bills is an inferential admission.
H: overrule the objection, because the evidence is relevant as to the question of the doctor's negligent hiring.
I: sustain the objection, because the patient's medical records are the best evidence of the doctor's negligence.
J: sustain the objection, as the doctor's offer does not directly imply guilt or negligence.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question. Let me read through it carefully. 

The scenario is about a patient who got too much Botox from a new medical assistant. She ended up with a frozen face and went to talk to the doctor. The doctor told her to go to the ER and send the bills to him, saying he'd take care of her medical expenses. Now, she's suing the doctor for negligent hiring and damages. 

At trial, she wants to call the doctor's administrative assistant, who was there during their conversation, to testify about the doctor's offer to pay the bills. The doctor's attorney objects. The question is whether the trial judge should sustain or overrule the objection.

I'm a bit rusty on evidence law, but I'll try to think it through. So, the main issue here is about the admissibility of the administrative assistant's testimony regarding the doctor's offer to pay medical bills.

I remember that offers to pay medical expenses can be tricky. There's a rule in evidence about offers to pay medical expenses being admissible or not. Let me recall. Oh right, Federal Rule of Evidence 409 deals with this. It says that evidence of offering or promising to pay medical expenses occasioned by an injury is not admissible to prove liability for the injury. But there's an exception: such evidence is admissible in a criminal case, or when it's offered to prove the injured party's actual injury, or when it's offered by the party making the payment (so the plaintiff can't object if the defendant offers it, but the defendant can't use it against the plaintiff). 

Wait, so in this case, the patient is offering this evidence to prove that the doctor is liable for negligent hiring. The doctor offered to pay her bills. So under FRE 409, this offer is not admissible to prove liability. Therefore, the administrative assistant's testimony about the offer should be excluded. 

Looking at the options, let me go through them. 

Option A: Sustain because the assistant isn't qualified on medical matters. But the testimony is about the offer, not medical expertise, so A seems irrelevant.

Option B: Sustain as an offer to pay medical bills. Oh, this aligns with 409. The objection would be sustained because such offers are inadmissible to prove liability.

Option C: Confidentiality. I don't think this is about patient-doctor privilege because the conversation was with an admin assistant present, and perhaps the offer relates to billing, not treatment. So C might not apply.

Option D: Overrule because the patient can call any witness. No, the rules of evidence can limit who can testify about what, so D isn't correct.

Option E: Overrule because it provides context. But context isn't the issue; the issue is whether it's admissible under 409. So E is probably wrong.

Option F: Overrule because it shows the doctor's character. Offers to pay bills don't directly relate to character evidence, so F is off.

Option G: Overrule because it's an inferential admission. Wait, inferential admissions are exceptions to hearsay, but here, the issue isn't hearsayâ€”it's about whether the offer is admissible under 409. So maybe G is about it being an admission, but I think 409 would still block it.

Option H: Overrule because it's relevant to negligent hiring. But even if relevant, 409 makes it inadmissible for proving liability, so H is incorrect.

Option I: Sustain because medical records are best evidence. The best evidence rule applies when the content of a writing is in question. Here, it's about an oral offer, so I isn't the right reason.

Option J: Sustain because the offer doesn't imply guilt. That's a possible reason, but the more precise rule is 409, making B the better answer.

So the correct answer should be B. The judge should sustain the objection because the offer to pay medical bills is inadmissible under FRE 409 to prove liability.

The question revolves around the admissibility of testimony regarding a doctor's offer to pay a patient's medical bills after a Botox incident. The patient is suing for negligent hiring, and her attorney seeks to have the doctor's administrative assistant testify about the doctor's offer. The doctor's attorney objects, and the trial judge must decide whether to sustain or overrule the objection.

Under Federal Rule of Evidence 409, evidence of offering or promising to pay medical expenses is generally inadmissible to prove liability for the injury. The rule explicitly states that such offers cannot be used to establish guilt or negligence. In this case, the patient seeks to admit the testimony to prove the doctor's liability for negligent hiring. Since the testimony pertains to an offer to pay medical expenses, it falls under the purview of FRE 409 and is therefore inadmissible for this purpose.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J**: These options either misapply the rules of evidence or fail to address the specific prohibition under FRE 409.
- **B**: This option correctly identifies that the objection should be sustained because the offer to pay medical bills is inadmissible under FRE 409 to prove liability.

Thus, the trial judge should sustain the objection based on FRE 409.
