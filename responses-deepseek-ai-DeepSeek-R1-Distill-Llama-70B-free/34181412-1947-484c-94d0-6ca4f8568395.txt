Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The problem says that X is uniformly distributed over the set {1, 2, ..., 256}. So X could be any number from 1 to 256, each with equal probability. Then, we're asking random yes/no questions like "Is X in S1?", "Is X in S2?", and so on until only one integer remains. All possible subsets of {1,2,...,256} are equally likely, meaning each subset S_i is equally probable.

The question is asking how many deterministic questions are needed to determine X. The options range from 1 to 1024, with some powers of two and such. Hmm.

Wait, wait. I think I remember something about information theory and binary search. Let me think. When you're trying to find an element in a set, each yes/no question can be thought of as a bit of information. So if you have N elements, you need log2(N) bits to uniquely identify each one.

In this case, N is 256. So log2(256) is 8, because 2^8 is 256. So that would mean we need 8 questions, right? But wait, the question is about deterministic questions. Oh, wait, but each question is a subset, and the way the subsets are chosen might affect this.

Wait, the problem says that all 2^256 subsets are equally likely. So each question is a subset Si, and for each question, the answer is yes or no. But since the subsets are chosen uniformly at random, each question gives us a certain amount of information. But how much?

Wait, perhaps I should think about it differently. Each question is a subset, and each yes/no answer partitions the remaining possibilities. To uniquely determine X, we need enough questions so that the combination of answers uniquely identifies X.

But the key here is that the questions are not adaptive; they are fixed beforehand. Wait no, wait. The problem says "we ask random questions... until only one integer remains." So it's an adaptive process, because each question depends on previous answers. Or is it?

Wait, no, the problem says that all subsets are equally likely. So maybe each question is a random subset, but the same for each step. Or perhaps each question is chosen uniformly at random each time, independent of previous steps. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. The problem says that all 2^256 subsets are equally likely. So each question is a random subset, but each time we ask a question, it's a randomly selected subset. So each question is a Bernoulli trial where each element is included with probability 1/2, independent of others.

Wait, but in that case, each question gives us a certain amount of information. For each question, each element has a 50% chance of being in the subset. So for a particular X, each question tells us whether X is in that subset or not. If each subset is independent, then the answers are independent bits of information about X.

Now, to uniquely determine X, we need enough independent bits so that each X has a unique combination of answers. Since X is one of 256 possibilities, we need enough bits to cover all 256 possibilities.

Each question provides one bit of information. So to get 8 bits (since 2^8=256), we'd need 8 questions. So the answer would be 8, which is option E.

Wait, but the options given include E as 8, so that would be the answer. But let me make sure I'm not missing anything.

Wait, another angle: each yes/no question can be seen as a function that partitions the set. The number of possible outcomes after k questions is 2^k. To uniquely identify one element out of 256, you need 2^k >=256, which gives k>=8. So 8 questions. So yes, the answer should be E:8.
</think>

To determine how many deterministic questions are needed to identify \( X \) uniformly distributed over \(\{1, 2, \ldots, 256\}\), we can analyze the problem using information theory. Each yes/no question provides one bit of information, as it partitions the set of possible values into two subsets. To uniquely identify one element out of 256, we need enough bits to cover all possibilities. Since \( 2^8 = 256 \), we require 8 bits of information. Each question provides one bit, so 8 questions are sufficient to uniquely determine \( X \).

The problem specifies that all \( 2^{256} \) subsets are equally likely, meaning each question is independent and provides one bit of information. This aligns with the requirement of 8 questions to uniquely identify \( X \). Thus, the correct answer is:

**E: 8**

Answer: E
