Okay, so I've got this problem about a DC machine being used as a separately excited generator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the question has three parts: (a) finding the gross field circuit resistance and field current, (b) determining the electromagnetic torque and power, and (c) finding the no-load terminal voltage and voltage regulation.

Starting with part (a). The machine is a separately excited generator, which means the field winding is connected to a separate voltage source. The field is supplied from a 250 V source. So the field current depends on the resistance in the field circuit.

Wait, the problem gives the field resistance as 225 ohms. Oh wait, no—that's probably when it's in some other configuration. Because in the separately excited case, the field circuit resistance would be the sum of the field resistance and any added resistance, right? But wait, no, wait. The question is asking for the gross field circuit resistance. Oh wait, maybe it's the total resistance in the field circuit now, including any external resistors. Because the field is being supplied from a constant voltage source of 250 V, so any resistance in the field circuit would determine the current.

Wait, the field resistance given is 225 ohms. So if the field is supplied by 250 V, the field current would be I_f = V / R_f_total. But the R_f_total is the sum of the internal field resistance plus any external resistor. Or wait, wait—maybe in this setup, the field is connected directly, so R_f_total is just 225 ohms. But looking at the problem, the question says, "gross field circuit resistance"—so that's the total resistance, which might include any external resistors. But I'm not sure if any external resistor is present here. Hmm.

Wait, in the problem statement, the field is supplied from a constant voltage source of 250 volts. So I think the field current is determined by the resistance in the field circuit. If the field resistance is 225 ohms, then the field current I_f would be V_f / R_field. So I_f = 250 V / 225 ohms, which is approximately 1.111... Amps. Let me calculate that: 250 / 225 = 1.111 A, which is about 1.111 A. So that's the field current. So the gross field resistance would just be 225 ohms because that's the only resistance in the field circuit (since it's supplied by a constant voltage source). So part (a) would be R = 225 ohms, I_f = 1.111 A.

Looking at the options, option E has R=225, I=1.1 A. Option J has 218.3 ohms and higher current, but that doesn't fit. So for part (a), the answer would be E. But let me think again. Wait, the problem says "gross field circuit resistance"—so if the field is connected to 250 V, then the total resistance would be 225 ohms, so the current is 250/225 ≈ 1.111 A. So yes, E seems correct for part (a).

Moving on to part (b): electromagnetic torque and power. The machine is delivering a full load current of 95 A at 250 V. So the output power is V * I = 250 * 95 = 23750 watts. But wait, that's the output power. However, the power developed in the armature is more than that because some power is lost as I²R in the armature resistance.

Wait, the armature resistance is given as 0.10 ohms. So the armature current is 95 A, so the voltage drop in the armature is I * R_a = 95 * 0.10 = 9.5 volts. So the generated voltage E_g would be the terminal voltage plus this drop, so E_g = 250 + 9.5 = 259.5 volts.

Wait, but wait: in a generator, the generated voltage E_g is equal to V + I_a * R_a. So yes, that makes sense. Now, the generated voltage in a DC machine is given by E_g = (PφNZ)/(60a), where P is the number of poles, φ is flux per pole, N is speed in rpm, Z is number of armature conductors, a is the number of parallel paths. But since I don't have all those values, perhaps I can find the torque using another approach.

The electromagnetic torque T can be found from the equation T = (E_g * I_a) / (2πn), where n is the speed in revolutions per second. Alternatively, since power P = T * ω, where ω is the angular speed in radians per second. So another approach is to find the developed power, which is E_g * I_a, and then divide by the angular speed to get torque.

Wait, E_g is 259.5 V, and I_a is 95 A. So the developed power is 259.5 * 95 = let's calculate that. 259.5 * 95 = about 24,652.5 watts. Then, the speed is 900 rpm. Converting that to radians per second: 900 rpm = (900 * 2π) / 60 = 30π ≈ 94.248 rad/s.

So torque T = Power / ω = 24652.5 W / 94.248 rad/s ≈ 261.5 Nm. Approximately 262 Nm. But looking at the options, let me check each option's part (b). For example, option E says electromagnetic torque is 248 Nm and power 22,320 W. That doesn't fit. Option J says torque 261 Nm, power 24,650 W. That's very close to my calculation. So for part (b), torque is about 261 Nm, power 24,650 W. So looking at the options, option J seems to match this.

Wait, but wait: my calculation for E_g might be incorrect. Let me recheck. The terminal voltage is 250 V, and the armature resistance is 0.10 ohms. The armature current is 95 A, so the drop is 95 * 0.10 = 9.5 V. So E_g = 250 + 9.5 = 259.5 V. So E_g * I_a = 259.5 * 95 = 24,652.5 W. Then the speed is 900 rpm, which is 900/60 = 15 Hz, so angular speed ω = 2π*15 ≈ 94.248 rad/s. So torque T = 24,652.5 / 94.248 ≈ 261.6 Nm. So about 262 Nm, but the exact calculation would give 261.6, so option J has 261 Nm, which is very close. So part (b) would be torque 261 Nm, power 24,650 W, which is option J.

Now part (c): no-load terminal voltage and voltage regulation. So when the machine is running at no load, the armature current I_a is zero. So the terminal voltage V_0 would be equal to the generated voltage E_g0, as there's no voltage drop in the armature resistance.

Wait, but wait: when the machine is at no load, the only current is the field current. Wait, no—the field current is supplied from a separate source, so the armature current is zero. So the generated voltage at no load would be E_g0 = V + I_a * R_a. But I_a is zero, so E_g0 = V. But wait, no. Wait, no—when the machine is at no load, the terminal voltage V_0 equals the generated voltage E_g0. Because I_a is zero, so V_0 = E_g0.

Wait, but E_g depends on the speed and the field flux. Since the speed is the same (constant speed of 900 rpm), and the field current is the same as in part (a), which is 1.111 A, then E_g0 would be the same as in part (a) when the load is applied. Wait, no—because in part (a), the field current is 1.111 A, but when running at full load, the armature reaction might affect the flux, but assuming the field current is the same, the generated voltage E_g0 at no load would be the same as E_g at full load.

Wait, but no, E_g depends on the field current. If the field current is the same, then E_g would be the same. But wait, no, in part (a), the field current is determined by the 250 V source and the field resistance, which is 225 ohms. So I_f is 250/225 ≈ 1.111 A. So the flux is proportional to I_f, assuming the field resistance is the same. So at no load, the generated voltage E_g0 is the same as the E_g at full load, because the speed and field current haven't changed. So E_g0 would be 259.5 V, same as when it's under load. Wait, but that can't be right because when you apply a load, the armature reaction might change things, but in a separately excited generator, the field current is held constant, so the flux is constant. Therefore, E_g is V + I_a R_a. So at no load, I_a is zero, so V_0 = E_g0 = V + 0 = 250 V? Wait, no, because E_g is V + I_a R_a. So at no load, I_a is zero, so E_g0 = V = 250 V.

Wait, but that contradicts my earlier calculation. Let me rethink. When the machine is running at full load, the generated voltage E_g is higher than the terminal voltage V because E_g = V + I_a R_a. So E_g = 250 + (95)(0.10) = 259.5 V. At no load, I_a is zero, so E_g0 = V_0. But the field current is the same, so the generated voltage should be the same as E_g in full load, but wait, no—because E_g is determined by field current and speed, which are the same. So E_g0 = E_g = 259.5 V. Therefore, the terminal voltage at no load V_0 is 259.5 V.

Wait, that makes sense. So the no-load voltage is 259.5 V. Then, voltage regulation is (V_0 - V)/V * 100%. So V_0 is 259.5 V, V is 250 V. So (259.5 - 250)/250 *100 = (9.5/250)*100 = 3.8%. So voltage regulation is 3.8%.

Looking at the options, option J says no-load voltage 259.5 V, regulation 3.8%. So that fits.

So putting it all together:

(a) R_field_circuit = 225 ohms, I_f = 1.111 A (approx 1.11 A).

(b) Torque ≈261 Nm, Power ≈24,650 W.

(c) V_0 = 259.5 V, regulation 3.8%.

Looking at the options, option J matches all these: 

gross field circuit resistance = 218.3 ohms? Wait, wait, no. Wait, in option J, the field resistance is 218.3 ohms, but I thought it was 225 ohms. Wait, did I make a mistake earlier?

Wait, wait, wait. Let me go back. For part (a), I thought the field resistance is 225 ohms, so gross field resistance is 225, giving I_f = 250/225 = 1.111 A. But option J says 218.3 ohms and 1.144 A. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check the problem statement again. It says:

armature resistance = 0.10 ohm

field resistance = 225 ohms

Wait, so the field resistance is 225 ohms. So when the field is connected to 250 V, the field current is 250 / 225 = 1.111 A. So the gross field circuit resistance is 225 ohms, not 218.3. So why does option J have 218.3 ohms?

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the field resistance in the options includes some other consideration. Wait, perhaps when the machine is used as a generator, the field current is determined by the field resistance. Wait, but the problem states that the field is supplied from a constant voltage source, so the field current is V_field / R_field_total. So if the field resistance is 225 ohms, then R_field_total is 225, giving I_f = 1.111 A.

But in option E, part (a) is 225 ohms and 1.1 A. So E's part (a) would be correct. Then, for part (b), the torque and power: E's part (b) is 248 Nm and 22,320 W. But according to my calculation, it's about 261 Nm and 24,650 W, which is option J's part (b).

Hmm, but that's a conflict. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the approach for part (b). Maybe I confused the developed power with the output power. Let's think again.

In a generator, the output power is V * I = 250 * 95 = 23750 W. The armature losses are I² R_a = 95² * 0.10 = 902.5 W. So the developed power (which is the power developed in the armature) is output power plus losses: 23750 + 902.5 = 24652.5 W.

Then, the torque T = developed power / angular speed. The angular speed at 900 rpm is 900 * 2π / 60 = 30π ≈ 94.248 rad/s.

So T = 24652.5 / 94.248 ≈ 261.6 Nm. So that's correct. So part (b) would have torque 261.6 Nm, power 24,652.5 W.

Which matches option J's part (b): 261 Nm, 24,650 W.

So for part (a), according to the problem, field resistance is 225 ohms, so I_f = 250 / 225 ≈ 1.111 A. So option E has 225 ohms and 1.1 A for part (a), but option J has 218.3 ohms and 1.144 A. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps the field resistance given in the problem is the resistance of the field winding alone, and the total field circuit resistance includes an external resistor. But the problem says the field is supplied from a constant voltage source of 250 V. So if the field resistance is 225 ohms, and if there's an external resistor, then R_total = 225 + R_external. But the problem doesn't mention any external resistor, so perhaps it's just 225 ohms.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in part (c). Let me re-examine part (c).

At no load, the armature current is zero. So the generated voltage E_g0 equals the terminal voltage V_0. But E_g0 is determined by the field current and speed.

In part (a), the field current is 1.111 A, which is the same as when running at full load because the field is supplied by a constant voltage source. So the generated voltage at no load would be the same as the generated voltage at full load, which is E_g = 259.5 V. So V_0 = 259.5 V.

Then, voltage regulation is (V_0 - V) / V * 100%. So (259.5 - 250) / 250 * 100 = 9.5 / 250 * 100 = 3.8%.

So part (c) gives V_0 = 259.5 V, regulation 3.8%, which matches option J.

But in part (a), option J says R_f is 218.3 ohms, which doesn't align with the problem statement. So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in part (a). Let me think again: the field is connected to a 250 V source, and the field resistance is 225 ohms. So the field current I_f = V / R_f = 250 / 225 ≈ 1.111 A. So the field circuit resistance is 225, not 218.3. So in that case, option E's part (a) is correct, but option J's part (b) and (c) are correct. That's a problem because the options are A-J, each with all three parts.

Wait, perhaps the field resistance isn't 225 ohms. Wait, the problem says "armature resistance = 0.10 ohm field resistance = 225 ohms". So field resistance is 225 ohms.

So option E's part (a) is correct: 225 ohms, 1.1 A.

But then, part (b): E's part (b) is 248 Nm and 22,320 W, which doesn't match my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the developed power. Let me check again.

At full load, terminal voltage V = 250 V, I_a = 95 A.

E_g = V + I_a * R_a = 250 + (95)(0.10) = 250 + 9.5 = 259.5 V.

So E_g = 259.5 V.

The developed power is E_g * I_a = 259.5 * 95 = 24,652.5 W.

Speed is 900 rpm = 30π rad/s ≈ 94.248 rad/s.

Torque T = Power / ω = 24,652.5 / 94.248 ≈ 261.6 Nm.

So part (b) should be torque ≈262 Nm and power ≈24,650 W.

Looking at the options, only option J has these values. So how come option E's part (a) is correct, but part (b) and (c) are in option J.

This suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in part (a). Let me re-examine part (a) again.

Wait, the problem says the field is supplied from a constant voltage source of 250 V. The field resistance is 225 ohms. So the field current is 250 / 225 = 1.111 A.

Wait, but perhaps the gross field circuit resistance includes the armature resistance? No, that doesn't make sense. The field circuit is separate from the armature.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing field resistance and armature
