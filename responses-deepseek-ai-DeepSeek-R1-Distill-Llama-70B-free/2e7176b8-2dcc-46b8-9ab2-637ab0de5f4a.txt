Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me read it again.

The problem says: At West Elementary School, there are 20 more girls than boys. If there are 180 girls, how can you find the number of boys?

Hmm, so the school has more girls than boys by 20. So the number of girls is 20 more than the number of boys. And we're told there are 180 girls. So I need to find how many boys there are.

Let me think about this. Let's denote the number of boys as B and the number of girls as G. The problem says G = B + 20. Because there are 20 more girls than boys.

But wait, we know that G is 180. So substituting that in, 180 = B + 20.

So to find B, I need to solve for B. That means I subtract 20 from both sides of the equation. So B = 180 - 20.

Oh, right, so that would give me B = 160. So the number of boys is 160.

But wait, the question is asking how to find the number of boys, not the actual number. So looking at the options, I need to choose the operation that represents subtracting 20 from 180.

Let me look at the options again.

Option A: divide 20 by 180 — that doesn't make sense here. We don't need division for this problem.

Option B: add 180 to 20 — that would give 200, which is more than the number of girls, which can't be right because there are more girls than boys.

Option C: multiply 180 by 20 — that's 3600, which is way too high. Not relevant.

Option D: multiply 180 by 2 — that's 360, which again doesn't fit the scenario.

Option E: divide 180 by 20 — that's 9. But how does that relate? Maybe if I thought of the difference as a ratio, but that's not what's needed here.

Option F: subtract 20 from 20 — that's zero, which doesn't make sense as the number of boys can't be zero.

Option G: add 20 to 180 — that's 200, which is the same as option B. But that would mean more boys than girls, which contradicts the problem statement.

Option H: subtract 20 from 180 — that's 160, which is exactly what I calculated earlier.

Option I: multiply 20 by 180 — same as option C, which gives a much larger number.

Option J: subtract 180 from 20 — that would be negative 160, which doesn't make sense because you can't have a negative number of students.

So the correct operation is option H: subtract 20 from 180.

Wait, just to make sure I'm not mixing up the steps. The problem says there are 20 more girls than boys. So girls = boys + 20. Girls are 180, so boys = 180 - 20 = 160. Yep, that's correct. So the operation is subtracting 20 from 180.

To determine the number of boys at West Elementary School, we know there are 20 more girls than boys and that there are 180 girls. Let B represent the number of boys. The relationship can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Girls} = \text{Boys} + 20 \]

Substituting the given number of girls:

\[ 180 = B + 20 \]

To solve for B, subtract 20 from both sides:

\[ B = 180 - 20 \]
\[ B = 160 \]

The correct operation to find the number of boys is to subtract 20 from 180.

Answer: H
