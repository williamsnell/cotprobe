Question:

List and describe the stages of problem solving as proposed by Johnson.

Options:

A: Johnson proposed the stages of conceptualization, experimentation, and reflection for problem solving.
B: Johnson suggested that the stages of problem solving are analysis, implementation, and feedback.
C: The stages of problem solving are production, judgment, and incubation.
D: The three stages of problem solving according to Donald M. Johnson are preparation, production, and judgment.
E: Johnson's stages of problem solving include orientation, negotiation, and verification.
F: The stages of problem solving by Johnson are defined as comprehension, application, and consolidation.
G: Johnson's model includes the stages of recognition, strategy formulation, and monitoring.
H: According to Johnson, the stages of problem solving are preparation, execution, and evaluation.
I: The problem-solving stages outlined by Johnson are identification, exploration, and resolution.
J: According to Johnson, the stages are framing the problem, finding solutions, and assessing outcomes.

Okay, so I've got this question about the stages of problem solving proposed by Johnson, and I need to choose the correct option from A to J. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

First, I remember that there are several models of problem-solving stages. I think some common ones include steps like defining the problem, gathering info, brainstorming solutions, implementing, and evaluating. But I'm not sure which exact model is attributed to Johnson.

Wait, I think Donald M. Johnson might have a specific model. I recall that his stages might be something like preparation, production, and judgment. Let me see. Preparation would be like getting ready, understanding the problem. Production is when you come up with solutions, and judgment is evaluating those solutions. That sounds familiar.

Looking at the options, option D says: "The three stages of problem solving according to Donald M. Johnson are preparation, production, and judgment." That matches what I was thinking. So D might be the correct answer.

But wait, let me make sure I'm not confusing Johnson with other theorists. I know that some models have different stages. For example, another model might have analysis, design, implementation, and evaluation, but that's more like the software development life cycle, not Johnson's.

Option D specifically mentions Donald M. Johnson, so that's a good clue. Other options talk about different stages—like option A mentions conceptualization, experimentation, reflection, which doesn't ring a bell for Johnson. Option B is analysis, implementation, feedback, which also sounds more like a general process.

Option C's stages are production, judgment, incubation. Incubation is part of the creative thinking process, like in Wallas' model, which includes preparation, incubation, intimation, and verification. So that's different.

Option E is orientation, negotiation, verification. Not sure about that. Option F is comprehension, application, consolidation—those sound more like educational terms, maybe Bloom's taxonomy?

Option G talks about recognition, strategy, monitoring. That might be part of another model. Option H is preparation, execution, evaluation, which is similar but execution isn't the same as production. Option I is identification, exploration, resolution, which again seems a bit different. Option J is framing, finding solutions, assessing, which is a bit vague.

So putting it all together, I think option D is the correct answer because it aligns with what I remember about Johnson's three stages: preparation, production, judgment.

The correct answer is D. Johnson's stages of problem solving are preparation, production, and judgment.

Answer: D
