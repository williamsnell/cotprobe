Okay, so I've got this question here about ethics and morality. The question is asking which ethical theory locates morality beyond the sphere of rationality in an emotional 'moral impulse' towards others. The options are from A to J, each representing a different ethical theory.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that different ethical theories focus on different aspects. Let me try to recall each one.

Option A is Ethical Egoism, which I think is about acting in one's own self-interest. So it's more about what's best for the individual, not really about emotions towards others.

Option B is Ethics of Duty. That rings a bell as being related to deontology, which is about following duties, rules, and obligations. That's more about rationality because it's based on reason and what one ought to do regardless of consequences.

Option C is Postmodern ethics. Postmodern thought often challenges grand narratives and might emphasize diversity and subjective experience. But I'm not sure how directly it ties to emotional impulses towards others. It's more about rejecting universal truths.

Option D is Consequentialist ethics. This is all about the outcomes; if an action leads to good consequences, it's morally right. Again, this seems more about rational calculation of outcomes than emotional impulses.

Option E is Utilitarian ethics, which is a type of consequentialism. It focuses on maximizing overall happiness or utility. So again, it's more about calculating what's best for the most people, which is rational rather than emotional.

Option F is Deontological ethics, which is the same as Ethics of Duty (option B). So I can group these together. They're about duties and rules, which are rational constructs.

Option G is Virtue ethics. This focuses on the character of the person, like virtues such as compassion or honesty. It's more about being a good person and developing good habits. While it does involve traits that might be emotional, I'm not sure if it's specifically about an emotional impulse towards others beyond rationality.

Option H is Ethics of care. Oh, right! I remember this one. Ethics of care is a theory that emphasizes empathy and care in relationships. It's about responding to the needs of others out of a sense of responsibility and emotional connection. This seems to fit the description because it's about an emotional impulse rather than rational calculations or duties.

Option I is Ethics of rights. This is about respecting the rights of individuals, which is more of a rational framework. Rights are often based on reason and justice rather than emotional responses.

Option J is Relativist ethics. This theory holds that moral judgments are relative to cultural or personal perspectives. It doesn't specifically focus on emotional impulses towards others; it's more about variation in moral standards.

Putting it all together, the question is about locating morality in an emotional impulse beyond rationality. Ethics of care (option H) fits because it's centered on emotional responses and caring for others, rather than rational duty or consequences.

The question asks which ethical theory places morality in an emotional 'moral impulse' towards others, beyond rationality. Among the options, **Ethics of care** (Option H) is the correct answer. This theory emphasizes empathy, emotional connection, and caring for others' needs, making it distinct from rational or duty-based approaches.

Answer: H
