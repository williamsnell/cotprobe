Question:

Cellular uptake of cholesterol occurs through internalization of low density lipoproteincholesterol complexes. Cholesterol uptake involves all of the following EXCEPT

Options:

A: cell-surface receptors
B: adhesion plaques
C: endosome formation
D: receptor-mediated endocytosis

Okay, so I've got this question about how cells take in cholesterol. Hmm, I remember that it's something to do with LDL, right? Oh yeah, low-density lipoprotein. So the question is asking which of the options is NOT involved in the process.

The question gives four options: A is cell-surface receptors, B is adhesion plaques, C is endosome formation, and D is receptor-mediated endocytosis.

Let me think. I remember that when LDL binds to the cell, it's through specific receptors on the cell surface. So that's option A, which is definitely involved. Then the process involves the cell taking in the LDL by engulfing it, which is called endocytosis. That's receptor-mediated because the receptors guide where the LDL goes. So option D is part of the process.

Once the LDL is inside, it gets into these vesicles called endosomes. So option C, endosome formation, is part of the process. That leaves option B, adhesion plaques. Wait, what are adhesion plaques? I think they're structures involved in cell adhesion, like where the cell sticks to the extracellular matrix or other cells. They might involve integrins and such, right? Or maybe I'm confusing them with focal adhesions.

Wait, so during receptor-mediated endocytosis, the cell membrane forms a pit, which then buds off into the cell as a vesicle. That requires a protein coating, like clathrin. The receptors are in the cell membrane, and when they bind LDL, the pit forms. So the structures involved are the receptors, the endosomes after the vesicle fuses, and the endocytosis process itself.

I don't recall adhesion plaques being part of this cholesterol uptake process. Adhesion plaques might be more about keeping the cell attached rather than taking in molecules. So the correct answer would be option B.

The cellular uptake of cholesterol involves the internalization of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol complexes through a process called receptor-mediated endocytosis. This process includes the following steps:

1. **Cell-surface receptors (Option A):** LDL binds to specific receptors on the cell surface, which is essential for initiating the uptake process.
2. **Receptor-mediated endocytosis (Option D):** After binding, the cell membrane forms a clathrin-coated pit, which engulfs the LDL complex and internalizes it as a vesicle.
3. **Endosome formation (Option C):** The internalized vesicle fuses with an endosome, where the LDL is processed further.

**Adhesion plaques (Option B),** however, are not involved in this process. Adhesion plaques are structures related to cell adhesion, such as focal adhesions, and are not part of the cholesterol uptake mechanism.

Thus, the correct answer is:

B
