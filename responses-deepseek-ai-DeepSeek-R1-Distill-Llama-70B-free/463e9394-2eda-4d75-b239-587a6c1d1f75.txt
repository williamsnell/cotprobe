Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about theories that support the idea that aggression is necessary. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty on psychology theories, but I'll think it through.

The question is asking which pair of theories back up the belief that aggression is necessary. The options are A to G, each with two theories. I need to figure out which pair fits.

First, I'll recall what each theory is about. Let's go through the options one by one.

Option A: "Aggressive Energy" theory and "Natural Born Killer" theory. I'm not too sure about these. Aggressive Energy might relate to Freud's ideas, but I don't remember a specific theory named exactly that. Natural Born Killer sounds more like a movie title, not a psychological theory. Maybe it's something else? Not sure.

Option B: "Game" theory and "Cognitive Neoassociation" theory. Game theory is more of an economics and decision-making approach, isn't it? Not directly about aggression being necessary. Cognitive Neoassociation... I think that's Berkowitz's theory, which says that negative emotions can lead to aggressive thoughts, which then lead to aggression. So that's about how aggression occurs, but does it say it's necessary? Not sure.

Option C: "Psychoanalytic" theory and "Drive" theory. Psychoanalytic is Freudian. Freud had the idea of the death instinct, which could relate to aggression. Drive theory, maybe like the drive reduction theory where aggression is a result of frustration (like the frustration-aggression hypothesis). But do these theories say aggression is necessary? Drive theory might suggest that it's driven by needs, so perhaps necessary in some contexts. But I'm not certain if these are the best fits.

Option D: "Dominance" theory and "Behaviorist" theory. Dominance theory is about hierarchy and power, maybe from evolutionary psychology. Behaviorist theories focus on learning, like Skinner's operant conditioning. Do these support that aggression is necessary? Maybe dominance implies that aggression is needed to establish order, but behaviorist is more about learning. Not sure if this is the right pair.

Option E: "Evolution" theory and "Conflict" theory. Evolutionary theory suggests that traits, including aggression, have evolved because they aid survival and reproduction. So aggression might be seen as necessary for survival. Conflict theory, I'm not too sure. Wait, conflict theory is more of a sociological term, often related to Marx and class struggle, but in psychology? Maybe it's about group conflict, which could involve aggression as a necessary aspect of competition. This seems plausible.

Option F: "Social Learning" theory and "Biological" theory. Social learning is Bandura's approach, where aggression is learned through observation and imitation. Biological theories look at genetics and brain functions. Both explain causes of aggression but don't necessarily argue it's necessary. So they might not support the necessity aspect.

Option G: "Survival of the fittest" theory and "Catharsis" theory. Survival of the fittest is part of evolutionary theory. Catharsis is about releasing pent-up emotions, like aggression through harmless activities. So survival of the fittest would support that aggression is necessary for survival, while catharsis is more about reducing aggression. So this pair might have one supporting and the other not. But wait, do they both support that aggression is necessary? Catharsis might be about the need to express aggression, but not necessarily that it's required in a positive sense.

Wait, the question is about which theories support the belief that aggression is necessary. So I'm looking for theories that suggest aggression serves a necessary function or purpose.

So, "Survival of the fittest" (Option G) is definitely one. It's from evolutionary theory, suggesting that aggression helps in competing for resources, thus necessary for survival.

"Catharsis" theory (Option G) suggests that releasing aggression is healthy, which might imply that it's a natural and necessary outlet. But I'm not sure if that's the same as saying aggression itself is necessary. Catharsis is more about the expression of aggression rather than its necessity.

Looking back at the options, Option E has "Evolution" theory, which would include survival of the fittest, and "Conflict" theory. If conflict theory is about competition and aggression being a necessary part of conflict resolution or group competition, then yes, both would support that aggression is necessary.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about "Conflict" theory in this context. Maybe it's referring to the idea that conflict drives progress or is necessary for change, which might involve aggression. So E could be a good fit.

Alternatively, Option G's "Survival of the fittest" is definitely about necessity. What about the other part? "Catharsis" might not fit as well because it's about releasing emotions rather than the necessity of aggression itself.

So perhaps Option E is better. Evolution theory supports that aggression is necessary for survival, and conflict theory might support that aggression arises from necessary competition or conflicts, making it a necessary aspect in some contexts.

Another angle: Maybe "Drive" theory (Option C) and psychoanalytic theory (also Option C) support that aggression is necessary. Drive theory, like the frustration-aggression hypothesis, posits that aggression is a drive, so it's a necessary response under certain conditions. Psychoanalytic theory might see aggression as an instinctual drive, necessary for survival or as part of the human psyche.

Wait, so let me compare. Option C's theories both relate to drives. Drive theory suggests that aggression is a reaction to frustration, making it a necessary outcome. Psychoanalytic theory, especially Freud's death instinct, sees aggression as an innate drive, which is necessary in some contexts, perhaps for survival or as part of human nature.

Option E's Evolution theory clearly supports necessity through natural selection. Conflict theory I'm still a bit shaky on, but maybe in the context of group conflict, aggression is necessary for a group's survival.

So which pair is more accurate? I'm a bit torn between C and E. But I think Evolution theory (E) is a stronger fit for necessity, as it's directly about traits being selected because they aid survival, making aggression necessary. Conflict theory, if it's about competition leading to necessary aggression, then E makes sense.

Alternatively, Option G's "Survival of the fittest" is part of Evolution theory. So Option G includes that, but pairs it with Catharsis, which I'm less sure about.

Wait, another thought: The "Catharsis" theory doesn't really support that aggression is necessary. Instead, it's about the idea that expressing aggression (like through sports) is a way to reduce it. So maybe G isn't the right choice.

That leaves me with Option E: Evolution and Conflict. Evolution definitely supports aggression as necessary. Conflict theory, if we're talking about intergroup conflict, suggests that aggression is a necessary part of competition, which would support the idea.

Alternatively, Option C's Drive and Psychoanalytic theories also suggest that aggression is a necessary drive. So which pair is correct?

I think Evolution theory (E) is a solid choice because it's clear. Drive theory (C) is about the drive leading to aggression when blocked, which could be seen as making aggression necessary in certain situations.

Wait, the question is about theories that support the belief that aggression is necessary, not just that it occurs. So Evolution theory would say it's necessary for survival. Drive theory might say that under certain conditions, aggression is a necessary response.

I'm a bit confused, but I think the correct answer is E: Evolution and Conflict theories.

Wait, no. Another thought: "Conflict" theory is more of a sociological term, not a psychological one. So perhaps in psychology, the more relevant theories are Evolution and maybe something else.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is G, because "Survival of the fittest" is a part of Evolution theory, and "Catharsis" theory relates to the need to express aggression, implying it's a necessary outlet.

But I'm getting myself more confused. Let me try to remember some key theories.

Psychoanalytic theory (Option C) does suggest that aggression is an instinct, part of the id, so it's necessary in that context.

Drive theory, which is part of psychoanalytic theory perhaps, or another approach? Wait, Drive theory might be more behaviorist, like the idea that drives (hunger, thirst, sex) are necessary for survival. So maybe Drive theory sees aggression as a necessary drive.

Wait, but I'm getting myself tangled here. Let me list out the theories:

- Evolutionary theory: Aggression is necessary for survival and reproduction.
- Catharsis: Aggression is pent-up energy that needs to be released.
- Psychoanalytic: Aggression is an instinct (death drive), so necessary.
- Drive theory: Maybe part of this, like the frustration-aggression hypothesis, where aggression is a necessary response when goals are blocked.
- Social Learning: Aggression is learned, so not necessary per se.
- Behaviorist: Focus on environment and learning, not on necessity.
- Game theory: Doesn't directly relate to aggression necessity.
- Cognitive Neoassociation: More about how emotions lead to aggression, not necessity.
- Dominance theory: Aggression is necessary to establish hierarchy.
- Survival of the fittest: Same as Evolution.

So looking at the options, Option G has "Survival of the fittest" which is Evolution, and "Catharsis" which is about releasing aggression. So maybe G is the answer because "Survival of the fittest" supports necessity, and "Catharsis" supports the idea that aggression needs to be expressed, thus is necessary.

Wait, but I'm not sure if Catharsis theory says aggression is necessary. It's more about the expression reducing tension. So maybe it's not the best fit.

Alternatively, Option C: Psychoanalytic and Drive theory. Both suggest that aggression is an instinct or drive, making it necessary.

So perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but I thought Evolution theory is a big one. Let me check the options again.

Option E: Evolution and Conflict.

Option C: Psychoanalytic and Drive.

Option G: Survival and Catharsis.

I'm getting stuck. I think I'll go with Option E: Evolution and Conflict theories supporting that aggression is necessary because Evolution clearly does, and Conflict theory, perhaps in the sense of necessary competition leading to aggression.

Wait, but Conflict theory might not directly address aggression's necessity. Hmm.

Alternatively, I remember that in psychology, the theory that aggression is necessary for survival is the Evolutionary perspective. Another theory that suggests aggression is necessary is the Catharsis theory, which posits that it's necessary to release aggression. So Option G would have both.

Wait, but I'm not certain. I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of each option's theories.

Option G: "Survival of the fittest" definitely supports necessity. "Catharsis" is about releasing aggression, so it might support that expressing aggression is necessary for mental health, implying that aggression itself is a necessary emotion to express.

So Option G could be the answer.

But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, Option E's Evolution and Conflict might not be the best fit.

Wait, I think I've made a mistake. Let me think again. The correct answer is probably E or C.

Wait, another approach: Which theories are cited as supporting aggression as necessary?

I recall that the evolutionary perspective (Option E) does. Also, the frustration-aggression hypothesis (Drive theory, Option C) suggests that when people are blocked from achieving their goals, they become aggressive. So in that sense, aggression is a necessary response to frustration.

Wait, but is that the same as saying aggression is necessary? Or just that it's a likely outcome under certain conditions.

Alternatively, the psychoanalytic theory (Option C) suggests that aggression is an instinct, so it's a necessary part of human nature.

So Option C could be the right answer: Psychoanalytic and Drive theories support that aggression is necessary.

Hmm, this is tricky. I'm going to go with Option E: Evolution and Conflict. Because Evolution definitely supports it, and Conflict theory might involve necessary competition leading to aggression.

Wait, but I'm not sure about Conflict theory. Maybe it's not a psychological theory. Let me think of another angle.

Wait, the "Conflict" theory in psychology might refer to approaches where conflict between individuals or groups drives certain behaviors, including aggression, which is necessary in those contexts.

Alternatively, perhaps the "Conflict" theory in the options refers to the Realistic Conflict Theory, which is a social psychology theory stating that intergroup conflict arises when groups compete for limited resources, leading to aggression. So in that case, aggression would be seen as necessary in the context of resource competition.

So Option E's two theories would both support that aggression is necessary.

But I'm not entirely certain, so I'm a bit torn between C and E.

Wait, another thought: The "Drive" theory, as in the frustration-aggression hypothesis, suggests that aggression is a necessary response to frustration. So if you're blocked from achieving a goal, aggression is the result. So Drive theory would support that aggression is necessary in certain situations.

Similarly, Psychoanalytic theory sees aggression as an instinct, so it's a necessary part of human behavior.

So Option C's theories both support the necessity of aggression.

Hmm. Now I'm more inclined to think that Option C is correct.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting possibilities. Let me try to remember the answer from my studies. I think the correct answer is E: Evolution and Conflict.

No, wait, I'm confusing with another question. Alternatively, I think the answer is G: Survival of the fittest and Catharsis. Because both relate to the necessity aspect.

Wait, but Catharsis is more about the expression, not the necessity of the aggression itself. So perhaps not.

I'm getting stuck, but I think the correct answer is E: Evolution and Conflict theories.
</think>

The question asks which pair of theories supports the belief that aggression is necessary. To determine the correct answer, each option was analyzed in detail:

- **Option A**: "Aggressive Energy" and "Natural Born Killer" theories are not recognized psychological theories, making this option unlikely.  
- **Option B**: "Game" theory is more about decision-making, and "Cognitive Neoassociation" explains how emotions lead to aggression but does not necessarily argue that aggression is necessary.  
- **Option C**: "Psychoanalytic" theory (Freud's death instinct) and "Drive" theory (frustration-aggression hypothesis) both suggest that aggression is a natural or necessary response, fitting the question well.  
- **Option D**: "Dominance" theory implies aggression is needed for hierarchy, but "Behaviorist" theory focuses on learning, not necessity.  
- **Option E**: "Evolution" theory clearly supports aggression as necessary for survival, and "Conflict" theory (e.g., Realistic Conflict Theory) suggests aggression arises from necessary competition, making this pair plausible.  
- **Option F**: "Social Learning" and "Biological" theories explain aggression's causes but do not emphasize its necessity.  
- **Option G**: "Survival of the fittest" (part of Evolution theory) supports necessity, but "Catharsis" focuses on releasing aggression rather than its necessity, making this pair less fitting.  

After considering the options, **Option C** ("Psychoanalytic" and "Drive" theories) and **Option E** ("Evolution" and "Conflict" theories) are the strongest candidates. However, **Option E** is more directly aligned with the idea that aggression is necessary, as Evolution theory clearly ties aggression to survival, and Conflict theory highlights its role in competition.  

Answer: E
