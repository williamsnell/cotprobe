Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Read the excerpts below.
This corruption is repeatedly designated by Paul by the term sin . . . such as adultery, fornication, theft, hatred, murder, revellings, he terms, in the same way, the fruits of sin, though in various passages of Scripture . . . we are, merely on account of such corruption, deservedly condemned by God, to whom nothing is acceptable but righteousness, innocence, and purity.
—John Calvin, from The Institutes of Christian Religion, Book 2: Chapter 1, 1545
The covenant of life is not preached equally to all, and among those to whom it is preached, does not always meet with the same reception. This diversity displays the unsearchable depth of the divine judgment, and is without doubt subordinate to God's purpose of eternal election. But if it is plainly owing to the mere pleasure of God that salvation is spontaneously offered to some, while others have no access to it, great and difficult questions immediately arise, questions which are inexplicable, when just views are not entertained concerning election and predestination[,] . . . the grace of God being illustrated by the contrast, viz., that he does not adopt all promiscuously to the hope of salvation, but gives to some what he denies to others.
—John Calvin, from The Institutes of Christian Religion, Book 3: Chapter 21, 1545

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the differences between Calvinists and Lutherans. I'm a bit rusty on my Protestant Reformation details, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking about the biggest contrast between Calvinists and Lutherans. The options are from A to J. I remember that both were part of the Reformation, but they had some key differences in their theological beliefs.

Looking at the excerpts provided, the first one talks about sin and how it separates us from God, who only accepts righteousness. The second excerpt discusses predestination and how God chooses some for salvation while others are not, which is a central Calvinist idea. So Calvin definitely emphasizes predestination here.

Now, what about Lutherans? I think Lutherans believed in justification by faith alone, which is similar to what Calvinists might believe, but I'm not sure about their stance on predestination. Wait, I remember that Lutherans might have had a different view on this. Maybe they believed in something called "single predestination," where God chooses some for salvation, but perhaps they didn't emphasize the double predestination aspect that Calvinists did. Or maybe they accepted some form of free will working with grace.

Looking at the options:

Option B says Calvinists believed in predestination while Lutherans advocated free will. That sounds plausible because Calvinism is known for its strong predestination views, part of the TULIP doctrine. Lutherans, on the other hand, might have believed that humans have some role in accepting salvation, perhaps through faith as a response, but not entirely predestined.

Option A suggests Lutherans believed in faith alone, Calvinists in good works. No, that's the opposite. Both believed in salvation through faith, but maybe Calvinists had a stronger emphasis on works as evidence of faith, but that's not the main contrast.

Option C is about Bible interpretation. Both Protestants emphasized individual interpretation, so that's probably not it.

Option D is about the Eucharist. Calvinists were more symbolic, while Lutherans believed in consubstantiation, not transubstantiation. But that's a different issue, not the biggest contrast.

Option E about saints: I think both rejected the idea of saints to some extent, so maybe that's not the main point.

Option F is about the Eucharist presence. As I thought, Calvin symbolic vs Lutheran real presence, but again, not the main theological difference between them.

Option G about sacraments: Lutherans kept more sacraments, Calvinists fewer. That's a difference, but perhaps not the biggest.

Option H: State and church relation. Calvinists had a certain view, but I'm not sure if that's the main contrast.

Option I: Church structure. Maybe, but I don't think that was the key theological difference.

Option J: Using faith for political reasons. Both did that, so probably not.

So the main difference seems to be predestination. So the answer would be option B.

The biggest contrast between Calvinists and Lutherans lies in their views on salvation. Calvinists, following John Calvin's teachings, emphasized the doctrine of predestination, believing that God has eternally decreed who will be saved and who will not, independent of human actions. This is a central tenet of Calvinism. On the other hand, Lutherans, while also affirming salvation by grace through faith, allowed for a role of human response and did not embrace the strict predestinarian views of Calvinism. This difference in understanding salvation is the most significant theological distinction between the two groups.
