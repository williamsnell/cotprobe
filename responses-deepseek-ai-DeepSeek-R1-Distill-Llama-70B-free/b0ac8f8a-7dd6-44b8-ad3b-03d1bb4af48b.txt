Okay, so I've got this question about pipelining in processors, and I need to figure out which statements are true. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.

So there are two processors, M-5 and M-7. Both use the same instruction set, which I think means they can run the same programs, but their internal architectures are different. The question is about their pipelines and clock cycles.

M-5 has a 5-stage pipeline with a 10ns clock cycle. M-7 has a 7-stage pipeline and a 7.5ns clock cycle. I remember that pipelining increases throughput by breaking down the processing into stages, allowing each stage to work on different instructions simultaneously.

The question asks about three statements: I, II, III. Let me go through each one.

Statement I: M-7’s pipeline has better maximum throughput than M-5’s pipeline.

Throughput is the number of instructions completed per unit time. Maximum throughput is usually determined by the clock rate and the number of stages. The formula for throughput is 1/(clock cycle time) when the pipeline is fully utilized. Because M-7's clock cycle is shorter (7.5ns vs 10ns), its throughput should be higher. So I think statement I is true.

Statement II: The latency of a single instruction is shorter on M-7’s pipeline than on M-5’s pipeline.

Latency is the time it takes for a single instruction to go through all the stages. For a pipelined processor, the latency is the number of stages multiplied by the clock cycle time. 

M-5: 5 stages * 10ns = 50ns.
M-7: 7 stages *7.5ns = 52.5ns.

Oh wait, M-7's latency is actually longer than M-5's. So statement II is false.

Statement III: Programs executing on M-7 will always run faster than programs executing on M-5.

Hmm, this isn't necessarily true. Pipeline depth affects throughput and latency, but other factors matter too. For example, if a program has a lot of dependencies between instructions (like a pipeline stall due to data hazards), the deeper pipeline (M-7) might not perform better. Also, programs with branches that are hard to predict might suffer more from misprediction penalties in a deeper pipeline. So it's not guaranteed that M-7 will always run programs faster. Therefore, statement III is false.

Wait, but wait—what about throughput versus latency? Throughput is about how many instructions are processed per second. If the program is a long, straight sequence without hazards, then M-7's higher throughput would make it run faster. But if the program has a lot of branches, maybe M-5's shorter pipeline would have less penalty when a branch is mispredicted. So whether the program runs faster depends on the specific program and its structure. So statement III is making a general claim that M-7 is always faster, which isn't true. So III is false.

So putting it all together:

Statement I is true.

Statement II is false.

Statement III is false.

So which options match this? Let's look at the options.

Option C says I only. That's correct.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake.

M-5's throughput is 1/10ns = 0.1 instructions per ns.

M-7's is 1/7.5ns ≈ 0.1333 instructions per ns. So yes, M-7's throughput is better, so I is correct.

Latency M-5 is 5*10=50ns, M-7 is 7*7.5=52.5ns. So M-7 has higher latency, making II incorrect.

So the only correct statement is I, which is option C.

To evaluate the statements about the two processors, we analyze their pipelines and clock cycles:

1. **Throughput (Statement I):**  
   Throughput is the number of instructions completed per unit time and is maximized when the pipeline is fully utilized. It is calculated as \( \text{Throughput} = \frac{1}{\text{Clock Cycle Time}} \).  
   - M-5: \( \frac{1}{10 \, \text{ns}} = 0.1 \, \text{instructions/ns} \).  
   - M-7: \( \frac{1}{7.5 \, \text{ns}} \approx 0.1333 \, \text{instructions/ns} \).  
   Since M-7 has a shorter clock cycle, its maximum throughput is higher. **Statement I is true.**

2. **Latency (Statement II):**  
   Latency is the time it takes for a single instruction to complete all pipeline stages. It is calculated as \( \text{Latency} = \text{Number of Stages} \times \text{Clock Cycle Time} \).  
   - M-5: \( 5 \times 10 \, \text{ns} = 50 \, \text{ns} \).  
   - M-7: \( 7 \times 7.5 \, \text{ns} = 52.5 \, \text{ns} \).  
   M-7 has a longer latency than M-5. **Statement II is false.**

3. **Program Execution Speed (Statement III):**  
   While M-7 has higher throughput, it does not always guarantee faster program execution. Factors like instruction dependencies, branch misprediction penalties, and pipeline stalls can negatively impact M-7's performance due to its deeper pipeline. Therefore, M-7 will not always run programs faster than M-5. **Statement III is false.**

### Conclusion:  
- **Statement I is true.**  
- **Statement II is false.**  
- **Statement III is false.**  

The only correct statement is **I**, which corresponds to **Option C**.
